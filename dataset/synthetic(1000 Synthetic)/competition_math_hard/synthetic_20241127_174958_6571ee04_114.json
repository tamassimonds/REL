  "solution": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem and craft a complete solution by reflecting on each step, brainstorming different strategies, and ensuring everything aligns with the final answer. Here's how I would naturally approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n- **Function Given:**  \n  \\( f(x) = \\frac{ax + b}{cx + d} \\) with \\( abcd \\neq 0 \\).\n  \n- **Condition:**  \n  \\( f(f(x)) = x \\) for all \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( f \\).\n  \n- **Goal:**  \n  Find the value of \\( a + d \\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- This reminds me of **involutions**, where applying a function twice returns the original input.\n- I vaguely recall that such functions might have specific relationships between their coefficients.\n- Honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to proceed right away. Maybe exploring different strategies would help.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Substitution:**\n   - Substitute \\( f(x) \\) into itself and see what equations emerge.\n   \n2. **Analyzing Involutions:**\n   - Since \\( f(f(x)) = x \\), \\( f \\) acts as its own inverse. Perhaps properties of inverse functions could be useful.\n\n3. **Symmetry Considerations:**\n   - Look for symmetry in the function that might hint at relationships between coefficients.\n\n4. **Simplifying the Function:**\n   - Attempt to express \\( f(x) \\) in a different form that makes \\( f(f(x)) = x \\) easier to handle.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The **direct substitution** seems like a straightforward starting point. If it gets messy, I can try simplifying or looking for patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Direct Substitution**\n\nLet's begin by substituting \\( f(x) \\) into itself:\n\n\\[\nf(f(x)) = f\\left( \\frac{ax + b}{cx + d} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Substitute \\( u = f(x) = \\frac{ax + b}{cx + d} \\), so we're looking for \\( f(u) \\).\n- Replace \\( x \\) in \\( f(x) \\) with \\( u \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nf(u) = \\frac{a\\left( \\frac{ax + b}{cx + d} \\right) + b}{c\\left( \\frac{ax + b}{cx + d} \\right) + d}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\frac{a(ax + b) + b(cx + d)}{cx + d}}{\\frac{c(ax + b) + d(cx + d)}{cx + d}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{a(ax) + ab + b(cx) + bd}{c(ax) + cb + d(cx) + dd}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{(a^2 + bc)x + ab + bd}{(ac + dc)x + cb + dd}}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Hmm, this expression looks quite complicated. I'm supposed to have \\( f(f(x)) = x \\), so setting this equal to \\( x \\) should yield an equation.\n- But wait, maybe there's a better way to organize this. Let's see if factoring helps.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Instead of proceeding with this messy expression, perhaps I can **factor differently or look for coefficients** that must match.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Analyzing Coefficients**\n\nGiven \\( f(f(x)) = x \\), the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(a^2 + bc)x + (ab + bd)}{(ac + dc)x + (bc + dd)} = x\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- For this equality to hold for **all \\( x \\)**, the numerators and denominators must satisfy certain conditions.\n- This suggests setting coefficients of corresponding terms equal.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Set the Denominator Equal to x:**\n\n\\[\n(ac + dc)x + (bc + dd) = x\n\\]\n\nThis would imply:\n\n\\[\n(ac + dc) = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (bc + dd) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Wait a minute, let's double-check this. Actually, the denominator should simplify to avoid division by zero or incorrect simplifications.\n- Perhaps I made an error in assigning these conditions directly. Let's re-examine.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- It seems like directly equating the denominator to \\( x \\) might not be correct. Instead, let's focus on ensuring that the entire fraction simplifies correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Equation**\n\nTo ensure \\( f(f(x)) = x \\), let's **multiply both sides by the denominator** to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + bc)x + (ab + bd) = x[(ac + dc)x + (bc + dd)]\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + bc)x + (ab + bd) = (ac)x^2 + (dc)x^2 + (bc)x + (dd)x\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n\\[\n0 = (ac + dc)x^2 + [(bc + dd) - (a^2 + bc)]x + (ab + bd)\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This is a **quadratic equation in terms of \\( x \\)**. For the equality to hold for all \\( x \\), each coefficient must individually be zero.\n- Therefore, set each coefficient to zero.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):**\n\n\\[\nac + dc = 0 \\implies c(a + d) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Since \\( c \\neq 0 \\) (given \\( abcd \\neq 0 \\)), this implies \\( a + d = 0 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Wait, that seems straightforward!** If \\( a + d = 0 \\), then \\( a = -d \\).\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[\n(bc + dd) - (a^2 + bc) = 0 \\implies dd - a^2 = 0 \\implies d^2 = a^2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Since \\( d \\neq 0 \\) and \\( a + d = 0 \\), this is consistent because \\( d = -a \\) and \\( d^2 = a^2 \\).\n\n3. **Constant Term:**\n\n\\[\nab + bd = 0 \\implies b(a + d) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Given \\( a + d = 0 \\), this condition is automatically satisfied.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- It all checks out! The conditions derived are consistent with each other. Therefore, \\( a + d = 0 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's **quickly verify**:\n\n- **Given \\( a + d = 0 \\):**\n  - Substituting \\( a = -d \\) back into the original function:\n  \n    \\[\n    f(x) = \\frac{ax + b}{cx - a}\n    \\]\n  \n- **Does \\( f(f(x)) = x \\) still hold?**\n  - With \\( a + d = 0 \\), all the derived conditions are satisfied, ensuring that \\( f(f(x)) = x \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Everything aligns perfectly. The value of \\( a + d \\) is indeed zero.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>0 solution</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorming Different Strategies:**  \n  Starting with direct substitution helped, but recognizing patterns in the coefficients led to a more straightforward solution.\n  \n- **Reflecting at Each Step:**  \n  Regularly checking the consistency of conditions ensured that no mistakes were carried forward.\n  \n- **Adjusting Approach When Needed:**  \n  Initially attempting to equate denominators directly was reconsidered, leading to a correct and complete solution.\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step, reflecting, and verifying at each stage, we confidently arrived at the correct answer: **\\( a + d = 0 \\)**.",
  "ground_truth": "The condition $f(f(x))$ means that $f$ is the inverse of itself, so its graph is symmetrical about the line $y = x$. With a rational function of this form, we will have two asymptotes: a vertical one at $x=-d/c$ if $cx+d$ does not divide $ax+b$, and a horizontal one at $y=a/c$, if we take the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ goes to $\\pm\\infty$. In order for $f$ to be its own inverse, the intersection of the asymptotes must lie on the line $y=x$ so that it and its asymptotes reflect onto themselves. This means that $-d/c=a/c$, and therefore $-d=a$ and $a+d=\\boxed{0}$."
