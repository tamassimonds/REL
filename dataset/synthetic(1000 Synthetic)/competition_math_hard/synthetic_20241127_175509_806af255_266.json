  "problem": "The American Mathematics College is holding its orientation for incoming freshmen. The incoming freshman class contains fewer than $500$ people. When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of $23$, $22$ people are in the last column. When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of $21$, $14$ people are in the last column. How many people are in the incoming freshman class?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check for correctness frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, we have fewer than 500 freshmen. When lining up in columns of 23, there are 22 people left over. Similarly, with columns of 21, there are 14 left over. This immediately reminds me of **remainder problems** I've seen before, possibly involving the **Chinese Remainder Theorem** or **modular arithmetic**. But honestly, it's been a while since I\u2019ve used those concepts, so I might need to refresh my memory.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Modular Arithmetic:**  \n   Use congruences to set up equations based on the remainders.\n   \n2. **Trial and Error:**  \n   Manually test numbers less than 500 to see which fits both conditions.\n   \n3. **Least Common Multiple (LCM):**  \n   Look for multiples of 23 and 21 and adjust for the remainders.\n   \n4. **System of Equations:**  \n   Create and solve a system based on the given conditions.\n\nAt first glance, **modular arithmetic** seems like the most straightforward, but I want to explore all options to be sure.\n\n### **Exploring Modular Arithmetic**\n\nLet's start here since it aligns well with the problem statement.\n\n- **Columns of 23:**  \n  The number of freshmen \\( n \\) leaves a remainder of 22.  \n  Mathematically, this is:  \n  \\[\n  n \\equiv 22 \\pmod{23}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Columns of 21:**  \n  The number of freshmen \\( n \\) leaves a remainder of 14.  \n  So:  \n  \\[\n  n \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n\nThis sets up a system of congruences. If I remember correctly, the **Chinese Remainder Theorem** can help solve this, but let's see if it's necessary.\n\n### **Reflection: Is This Approach Correct?**\n\nWait a minute. Before diving deeper, let's think: do these congruences make sense?\n\n- **Modulo 23:** Having 22 left over means only one spot is missing to complete another column.\n  \n- **Modulo 21:** Similarly, 14 left over means 7 spots are empty.\n\nYes, this aligns with the problem statement. So, it seems correct so far. But still, I'll proceed cautiously.\n\n### **Attempting to Solve Using Modular Arithmetic**\n\nLet\u2019s try to find \\( n \\) that satisfies both congruences.\n\n1. **Express \\( n \\) from the first congruence:**\n\n   From \\( n \\equiv 22 \\pmod{23} \\),  \n   \\( n = 23k + 22 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Substitute into the second congruence:**\n\n   Plugging into \\( n \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21} \\):  \n   \\[\n   23k + 22 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Simplify the equation:**\n\n   First, subtract 22 from both sides:  \n   \\[\n   23k \\equiv 14 - 22 \\pmod{21}  \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   23k \\equiv -8 \\pmod{21}\n   \\]\n   \n   But since we prefer positive remainders, add 21 to -8:  \n   \\[\n   23k \\equiv 13 \\pmod{21}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Wait, does this make sense?**\n\n   Hmm, looking at this, I realize that 23 is congruent to 2 modulo 21 because 23 - 21 = 2.  \n   So,  \n   \\[\n   2k \\equiv 13 \\pmod{21}\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Solving for \\( k \\):**\n\n   Now, I need to find \\( k \\) such that:  \n   \\[\n   2k \\equiv 13 \\pmod{21}\n   \\]\n   \n   To solve this, I can multiply both sides by the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 21. But honestly, finding inverses can be tricky without a calculator. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Trial and Error**\n\nSince the total number is less than 500, perhaps I can write a simple Python script or manually check multiples of 23 plus 22 to see which one also satisfies the second condition. This might be more straightforward.\n\n**Let\u2019s try it manually first:**\n\n- Compute \\( n = 23k + 22 \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots \\) until \\( n < 500 \\).\n- Check which \\( n \\) also satisfies \\( n \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21} \\).\n\n**Starting calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nk = 0: & \\quad n = 23(0) + 22 = 22 \\\\\nk = 1: & \\quad n = 23(1) + 22 = 45 \\\\\nk = 2: & \\quad n = 23(2) + 22 = 68 \\\\\nk = 3: & \\quad n = 23(3) + 22 = 91 \\\\\nk = 4: & \\quad n = 23(4) + 22 = 114 \\\\\nk = 5: & \\quad n = 23(5) + 22 = 137 \\\\\nk = 6: & \\quad n = 23(6) + 22 = 160 \\\\\nk = 7: & \\quad n = 23(7) + 22 = 183 \\\\\nk = 8: & \\quad n = 23(8) + 22 = 206 \\\\\nk = 9: & \\quad n = 23(9) + 22 = 229 \\\\\nk = 10: & \\quad n = 23(10) + 22 = 252 \\\\\nk = 11: & \\quad n = 23(11) + 22 = 275 \\\\\nk = 12: & \\quad n = 23(12) + 22 = 298 \\\\\nk = 13: & \\quad n = 23(13) + 22 = 321 \\\\\nk = 14: & \\quad n = 23(14) + 22 = 344 \\\\\nk = 15: & \\quad n = 23(15) + 22 = 367 \\\\\nk = 16: & \\quad n = 23(16) + 22 = 390 \\\\\nk = 17: & \\quad n = 23(17) + 22 = 413 \\\\\nk = 18: & \\quad n = 23(18) + 22 = 436 \\\\\nk = 19: & \\quad n = 23(19) + 22 = 459 \\\\\nk = 20: & \\quad n = 23(20) + 22 = 482 \\\\\nk = 21: & \\quad n = 23(21) + 22 = 505 \\quad (\\text{too large}) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection: Is This Correct?**\n\nWait, I need to check which of these \\( n \\) values also satisfy \\( n \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21} \\). Let's verify.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nn = 22: & \\quad 22 \\mod 21 = 1 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 45: & \\quad 45 \\mod 21 = 3 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 68: & \\quad 68 \\mod 21 = 5 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 91: & \\quad 91 \\mod 21 = 7 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 114: & \\quad 114 \\mod 21 = 9 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 137: & \\quad 137 \\mod 21 = 11 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 160: & \\quad 160 \\mod 21 = 13 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 183: & \\quad 183 \\mod 21 = 15 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 206: & \\quad 206 \\mod 21 = 17 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 229: & \\quad 229 \\mod 21 = 19 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 252: & \\quad 252 \\mod 21 = 0 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 275: & \\quad 275 \\mod 21 = 2 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 298: & \\quad 298 \\mod 21 = 4 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 321: & \\quad 321 \\mod 21 = 6 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 344: & \\quad 344 \\mod 21 = 8 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 367: & \\quad 367 \\mod 21 = 10 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 390: & \\quad 390 \\mod 21 = 12 \\quad (\\text{no}) \\\\\nn = 413: & \\quad 413 \\mod 21 = 14 \\quad (\\text{yes}) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n### **Realization: Found a Solution!**\n\n\\(\\mathbf{n = 413}\\) satisfies both conditions:\n\n- **Columns of 23:**  \n  \\(413 \\div 23 = 17\\) with a remainder of 22.\n\n- **Columns of 21:**  \n  \\(413 \\div 21 = 19\\) with a remainder of 14.\n\nThis makes sense! But let's double-check to ensure everything aligns.\n\n### **Double-Checking the Solution**\n\n- **Condition 1:**  \n  \\(413 \\equiv 22 \\pmod{23}\\)  \n  \\(413 - 23 \\times 17 = 413 - 391 = 22\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  \n- **Condition 2:**  \n  \\(413 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21}\\)  \n  \\(413 - 21 \\times 19 = 413 - 399 = 14\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so **\\( n = 413 \\)** is indeed the correct number of freshmen.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nInitially, I considered modular arithmetic, which led me to set up congruences. However, solving them manually seemed cumbersome, so I shifted to a **trial and error** approach within the given constraint (<500). This strategy proved effective, allowing me to find the correct solution efficiently.\n\n---\n\n**<ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{413}\n\\]\n\nThe incoming freshman class contains **413** people.\n\n---\n\nThat's the complete thought process, including brainstorming, checking, and adjusting strategies to arrive at the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "If $n$ is the number of people in the incoming class, then $n$ yields a remainder of $14$ when divided by $21$. Since both 21 and 14 are divisible by 7, this means that $n$ is divisible by $7$. Define $k=n/7$, and note that $7k \\equiv 14\\pmod{21}$. Dividing by 7, we get $k\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. Multiplying by 7 again, we get $n\\equiv 14\\pmod{3}$, which implies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. So we are looking for a solution to the following system of linear congruences: \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}, \\\\\nn&\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3},\\\\\nn&\\equiv 22 \\pmod{23}. \\\\\n\\end{align*} First, we look for a solution to the last two congruences. Checking numbers that are one less than a multiple of 23, we find that 68 satisfies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $n$ which satisfy both of the last two congruences are precisely those that differ from 68 by a multiple of $3\\cdot 23=69$. Checking $68+69$, $68+2\\cdot 69$, etc. we find that $68 + 5\\cdot 69 = \\boxed{413}$ is the least positive solution to the last two congruences which is also divisible by 7. Note that, by the Chinese remainder theorem again, the solutions of the above system of three congruences are precisely the positive integers that differ from 413 by a multiple of $7\\cdot3\\cdot23=483,$ so 413 is indeed the only solution between 0 and 500."
