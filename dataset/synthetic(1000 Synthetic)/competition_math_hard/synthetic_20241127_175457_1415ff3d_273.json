  "solution": "### **Calculating the Average Percent Score**\n\nMrs. Riley has recorded the test scores for 100 students, and our goal is to determine the average percent score. Let's walk through the process step by step to ensure we arrive at the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nGiven Data:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{\\% Score} & \\textbf{Number of Students} \\\\\n\\hline\n100 & 7 \\\\\n90  & 18 \\\\\n80  & 35 \\\\\n70  & 25 \\\\\n60  & 10 \\\\\n50  & 3 \\\\\n40  & 2 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nAt first glance, this looks like a problem involving averages. Each score corresponds to a certain number of students, so a simple average might not suffice. Let's explore different strategies to find the most appropriate one.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Simple Average:**  \n   Calculate the average of the given percent scores without considering the number of students.\n\n   - **Reflection:** This approach ignores the frequency of each score, which would lead to an inaccurate average.\n\n2. **Weighted Average:**  \n   Multiply each percent score by the number of students who received it, sum these products, and divide by the total number of students.\n\n   - **Initial Reaction:** This seems like the right approach since it accounts for how many students scored at each level.\n\n3. **Cumulative Frequency Approach:**  \n   Use cumulative frequencies to analyze the distribution and calculate the mean.\n\n   - **Thoughts:** This might complicate things unnecessarily for calculating the average.\n\n**Decision:**  \nThe **Weighted Average** method is the most suitable since it considers the varying number of students per score.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Weighted Average Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo calculate the weighted average:\n\n- Multiply each score by the number of students who received it.\n- Sum all the resulting products.\n- Divide by the total number of students (100).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Sum} = (100 \\times 7) + (90 \\times 18) + (80 \\times 35) + (70 \\times 25) + (60 \\times 10) + (50 \\times 3) + (40 \\times 2)\n\\]\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\n- \\(100 \\times 7 = 700\\)\n- \\(90 \\times 18 = 1620\\)\n- \\(80 \\times 35 = 2800\\)\n- \\(70 \\times 25 = 1750\\)\n- \\(60 \\times 10 = 600\\)\n- \\(50 \\times 3 = 150\\)\n- \\(40 \\times 2 = 80\\)\n\n**Summing Them Up:**  \n\n\\[\n700 + 1620 + 2800 + 1750 + 600 + 150 + 80 = 7700\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet\u2019s double-check the addition to ensure accuracy:\n\n- \\(700 + 1620 = 2320\\)\n- \\(2320 + 2800 = 5120\\)\n- \\(5120 + 1750 = 6870\\)\n- \\(6870 + 600 = 7470\\)\n- \\(7470 + 150 = 7620\\)\n- \\(7620 + 80 = 7700\\)\n\n**Check:**  \nThe total sum is **7700**, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Average Score**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, divide the total sum by the number of students to find the average percent score.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Total Sum}}{\\text{Total Number of Students}} = \\frac{7700}{100}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{7700}{100} = 77\n\\]\n\n**Immediate Reflection:**  \nAn average score of 77 seems reasonable given the distribution, with many students scoring 80 and 90.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nConsidering the majority of students scored 80 or above, an average of 77 aligns well with the data.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternate Strategy: Rough Estimation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s perform a rough estimation to validate the calculated average. Group the scores into high, medium, and low categories:\n\n- **High Scores:**  \n  - 100: 7 students\n  - 90: 18 students  \n  **Total High:** 25 students\n\n- **Medium Scores:**  \n  - 80: 35 students\n  - 70: 25 students  \n  **Total Medium:** 60 students\n\n- **Low Scores:**  \n  - 60: 10 students\n  - 50: 3 students\n  - 40: 2 students  \n  **Total Low:** 15 students\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWith 60% of students scoring in the medium range (mostly 80), and 25% in the high range, the average leaning towards 77 makes sense.\n\n**Check:**  \nThe rough estimation supports the calculated average, confirming the approach is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Step: Validating the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, ensure that all aspects of the weighted average method were correctly applied.\n\n- **Did I account for all students?**  \n  - Yes, the total number of students is 100.\n\n- **Were the multiplications and additions accurate?**  \n  - Yes, each calculation was verified step by step.\n\n- **Is dividing by 100 appropriate?**  \n  - Absolutely, since there are 100 students, dividing by 100 yields the correct average.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll calculations are accurate, and the approach is valid.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nNo errors found; the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>**\n\n\\(<ANSWER>77</ANSWER>\\)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe average percent score for Mrs. Riley's 100 students is **77**.\n\n---\n\n### **Post-Check Reflection**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Was the Weighted Average the Best Approach?**  \n  Yes, it ensured that each score was appropriately weighted based on the number of students.\n\n- **Did Rough Estimation Help?**  \n  Yes, it provided a sanity check to confirm the plausibility of the calculated average.\n\n- **Any Alternate Methods Worth Exploring?**  \n  While other methods exist, the weighted average was the most straightforward and effective for this problem.\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nThe step-by-step approach, including brainstorming, checking, and validating, ensured an accurate and reliable solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully applying the weighted average method and consistently verifying each step, we've accurately determined that the average percent score for Mrs. Riley's students is **77**. The thorough process, including rough estimation and multiple checks, guarantees the correctness of the solution.\n\n---",
  "ground_truth": "For simplicity, divide all the percent scores by $10.$ We will account for this later by multiplying by $10.$ The average percent score is equal to the sum of all percent scores divided by the total number of students $(100).$ The sum of all percent scores is $$10\\cdot7+9\\cdot18+8\\cdot35+7\\cdot25+6\\cdot10+5\\cdot3+4\\cdot2=770.$$ Since we divided all the percent scores by $10$ in the beginning, we multiply by $10$ to get that the sum of all percent scores is $770\\cdot10=7700.$ Finally, dividing by the total number of students, we find that the average percent score is $7700/100=\\boxed{77}.$"
