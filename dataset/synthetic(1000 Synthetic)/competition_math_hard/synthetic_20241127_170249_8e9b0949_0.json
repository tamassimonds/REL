  "solution": "Certainly! Let's put this all together into a coherent and complete solution, reflecting the natural problem-solving process while maintaining the final answer. I'll ensure the narrative flows smoothly, incorporating various strategies and checks as I explore the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive in. The problem states that the length of a rectangle is increased by \\(25\\%\\), and we need to figure out by what percent the width should be decreased to keep the area unchanged.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nHmm, this reminds me of problems involving proportional changes where adjusting one dimension affects another to maintain a constant area. It sounds like a classic inverse relationship, but I'm not entirely sure yet. Let's explore different strategies to confirm.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use Algebraic Expressions:**  \n   Set up equations representing the area before and after the change.\n\n2. **Think in Terms of Ratios:**  \n   Consider how the increase in length affects the width proportionally.\n\n3. **Visualize with a Sample Rectangle:**  \n   Assign specific numbers to the length and width to see how changes play out.\n\n4. **Apply Percentage Change Formulas:**  \n   Use standard formulas for percentage increase and decrease.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nStarting with algebraic expressions seems straightforward, but visualizing with numbers could help verify our approach. I'll begin with the algebraic method and see if it makes sense.\n\n### **Step 1: Set Up the Original Area**\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( L \\) as the original length\n- \\( W \\) as the original width\n\nTherefore, the original area \\( A = L \\times W \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBy defining the original dimensions, we have a clear starting point. Any changes will be relative to these values.\n\n### **Step 2: Increase the Length by 25%**\n\nThe new length \\( L' \\) is increased by \\(25\\%\\), so:\n\\[ \nL' = L + 0.25L = 1.25L \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense because increasing by \\(25\\%\\) is the same as multiplying the original length by \\(1.25\\).\n\n### **Step 3: Set Up the New Area with Decreased Width**\n\nLet\u2019s denote the new width as \\( W' \\). We know the area must remain unchanged, so:\n\\[ \nA' = L' \\times W' = L \\times W \n\\]\nSubstituting \\( L' = 1.25L \\):\n\\[ \n1.25L \\times W' = L \\times W \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBy setting the new area equal to the original area, we establish a relationship between the new width and the original dimensions.\n\n### **Step 4: Solve for the New Width \\( W' \\)**\n\nLet's isolate \\( W' \\) in the equation:\n\\[ \nW' = \\frac{L \\times W}{1.25L} \n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[ \nW' = \\frac{W}{1.25} \n\\]\n\n**Check Calculation:**  \n\\[ \n1.25 = \\frac{5}{4} \\Rightarrow \\frac{W}{1.25} = \\frac{W}{\\frac{5}{4}} = W \\times \\frac{4}{5} \n\\]\nSo,\n\\[ \nW' = 0.8W \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAlright, this shows that the new width is \\(80\\%\\) of the original width. It seems correct because reducing the width compensates for the increased length to keep the area constant.\n\n### **Step 5: Determine the Percent Decrease in Width**\n\nNow, we need to find by what percent the width was decreased:\n\\[ \n\\text{Percent Decrease} = \\left(1 - \\frac{W'}{W}\\right) \\times 100\\% \n\\]\nSubstituting \\( W' = 0.8W \\):\n\\[ \n\\text{Percent Decrease} = \\left(1 - 0.8\\right) \\times 100\\% = 0.2 \\times 100\\% = 20\\% \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nCalculating the percent decrease confirms that the width was reduced by \\(20\\%\\) to maintain the area.\n\n### **Step 6: Verification with a Sample Rectangle**\n\n**Assigning Sample Values:**  \nLet\u2019s say the original length \\( L = 100 \\) units and the original width \\( W = 50 \\) units.\nOriginal area \\( A = 100 \\times 50 = 5000 \\) square units.\n\n**Increase Length by 25%:**  \nNew length \\( L' = 1.25 \\times 100 = 125 \\) units.\n\n**Calculate New Width with 20% Decrease:**  \nNew width \\( W' = 0.8 \\times 50 = 40 \\) units.\n\n**Check the New Area:**  \nNew area \\( A' = 125 \\times 40 = 5000 \\) square units.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe new area matches the original area, confirming that a \\(20\\%\\) decrease in width balances the \\(25\\%\\) increase in length. This sample check validates our algebraic solution.\n\n### **Step 7: Exploring Alternate Strategies**\n\n**Using Ratios:**  \nThe area must remain constant, so the product of length and width stays the same. Increasing the length by \\(25\\%\\) means multiplying by \\(1.25\\). To keep the product unchanged, the width must be multiplied by the reciprocal of \\(1.25\\), which is \\(0.8\\).\n\n\\[ \n1.25 \\times 0.8 = 1 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis ratio approach aligns perfectly with our previous calculations, reinforcing that the width must decrease by \\(20\\%\\).\n\n### **Final Check: Does Everything Align?**\n\nAll methods\u2014algebraic, sample verification, and ratio analysis\u2014consistently point to a \\(20\\%\\) decrease in width. This consistency across different strategies confirms the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe rectangle's width was decreased by **<ANSWER>20\\%</ANSWER>** to keep the area unchanged after increasing the length by \\(25\\%\\).\n\n---\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nBy thoroughly exploring different strategies, checking each step with sample values, and ensuring consistency across methods, we've confidently arrived at the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "Let the original area be $x$. Since the area of the rectangle is length multiplied by width, increasing the length of a rectangle by 25 percent increases the area to $1.25x$. We need to multiply this area by some number $y$ to decrease it back to $x$. We have the equation $1.25xy=x\\Rightarrow y=1/1.25=.8$. So the width needs to be decreased to $.8$ times of the original in order to change the area back to the original area. Thus, the width needs to be adjusted $\\boxed{20}$ percent."
