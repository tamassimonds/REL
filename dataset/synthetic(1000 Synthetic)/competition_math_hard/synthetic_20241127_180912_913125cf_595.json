  "problem": "A sports conference has 14 teams in two divisions of 7.  How many games are in a complete season for the conference if each team must play every other team in its own division twice and every team in the other division once?",
  "solution": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, just like how I\u2019d approach it if I were solving it myself. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, check my work along the way, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about calculating the total number of games in a sports conference. Each team plays others within their division twice and teams from the other division once.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis reminds me of problems involving combinations and scheduling. I need to make sure I account for both intra-division and inter-division games correctly. Breaking it down into parts seems like a good idea to avoid missing anything.\n\n**First Strategy Idea:**  \nMaybe I can calculate the number of games within each division first, then add the games between divisions. But hmm... I\u2019m not entirely sure if that covers everything. Let me think it through.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate Intra-Division Games:**  \n   Each team plays every other team in its division twice.\n\n2. **Calculate Inter-Division Games:**  \n   Each team plays every team in the other division once.\n\n**Wait a Minute:**  \nIs there a possibility of overcounting or undercounting here? I need to ensure that each game is counted exactly once.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nPerhaps using combinations to determine the number of unique matchups might help. But since there are repeated games within divisions, I need to be careful.\n\nLet me stick with the initial strategy for now and see if it works. If not, I\u2019ll reevaluate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Intra-Division Games**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEach division has 7 teams. Every team plays every other team in its own division **twice**. This sounds like a combination problem with repetitions.\n\n**Calculation Approach:**  \n- First, find the number of unique pairs within a division.\n- Then, multiply by 2 because each matchup occurs twice.\n\n**Formula:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Number of games per division} = \\binom{n}{2} \\times 2\n\\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of teams per division.\n\n**Plugging in Numbers:**  \n\\[\n\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\n\\]\nSo, 21 unique matchups.\n\n\\[\n21 \\times 2 = 42 \\text{ games per division}\n\\]\n\n**Total for Both Divisions:**  \n\\[\n42 \\times 2 = 84 \\text{ intra-division games}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this make sense?  \n- Each team plays 6 other teams twice: \\( 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\) games per team.\n- There are 7 teams, but each game involves two teams, so \\( \\frac{7 \\times 12}{2} = 42 \\) games per division.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, that seems correct. Each division has 42 games, so 84 total for both divisions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Inter-Division Games**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEach team plays every team in the **other** division **once**. There are two divisions, each with 7 teams.\n\n**Calculation Approach:**  \n- Each team in one division plays 7 teams in the other division.\n- So, total inter-division games are \\( 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this make sense?  \n- Each team has 7 cross-division opponents.\n- There are 14 teams in total, but since each game involves two teams, 49 games should cover all inter-division matchups.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nYes, that seems right. No double-counting here since each matchup occurs only once.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Adding Both Intra-Division and Inter-Division Games**\n\n**Total Games Calculation:**  \n\\[\n84 \\text{ (intra-division)} + 49 \\text{ (inter-division)} = 133 \\text{ total games}\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**  \nLet me think about whether this approach makes sense overall.\n\n- **Intra-Division:**  \n  - Each division independently accounts for its games.\n  - No overlap between divisions here.\n\n- **Inter-Division:**  \n  - Each team plays once against each team in the other division.\n  - No double-counting since these are unique matchups.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything seems to align. The total number of games accounts for all required matchups without overcounting.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**<ANSWER>**  \n133 total games in the complete season.  \n**</ANSWER>**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nBy breaking down the problem into intra-division and inter-division components, I ensured that all games were accounted for without duplication. Checking each step along the way helped confirm that the calculations were correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Natural Human Reflection**\n\nInitially, I considered calculating games within each division and between divisions separately. I double-checked my approach by verifying the number of games per team and ensuring no double-counting occurred. This validation reinforced that the strategy was correct, leading me to the final answer confidently.\n\n---\n\n**Alright, that wraps it up!** By methodically working through each step and continuously reflecting on the approach, I was able to arrive at the correct total number of games.",
  "ground_truth": "Each team plays 6 other teams in its division twice, and the 7 teams in the other division once, for a total of $6 \\times 2 + 7 = 19$ games for each team.  There are 14 teams total, which gives a preliminary count of $19 \\times 14 = 266$ games, but we must divide by two because we have counted each game twice (once for one team and once for the other).  So the final answer is $\\dfrac{19 \\times 14}{2} = \\boxed{133}$ games."
