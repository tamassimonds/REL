  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, integrating our brainstorming, reflections, and calculations into a seamless narrative. We'll maintain the original thinking process while enhancing clarity and coherence.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding the Question\n\nThe task is to find the remainder when \\(333^{333}\\) is divided by \\(11\\). At first glance, this looks like a classic modular arithmetic problem. Dealing with such large exponents can be intimidating, so let's brainstorm different strategies to approach it.\n\n## Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Direct Calculation:** Compute \\(333^{333}\\) and then divide by \\(11\\) to find the remainder.\n   - **Thought:** Wait, that's impractical. The number is astronomically large, and no calculator can handle it. So, direct computation is out.\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic Laws:** Use properties of exponents under modulo operations to simplify the problem.\n   - **Thought:** This seems promising. I recall there's a way to reduce exponents using modular properties.\n\n3. **Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem:** This theorem often helps with problems involving primes and exponents.\n   - **Thought:** Since \\(11\\) is a prime, Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem might be applicable here. I should explore this further.\n\n4. **Exponent Reduction:** Break down the exponent to make calculations easier.\n   - **Thought:** Perhaps I can reduce \\(333\\) modulo \\(11\\) first and then deal with the exponent.\n\nReflecting on these strategies, using **Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem** combined with **modular arithmetic laws** seems like the best approach. Let's proceed with that.\n\n## Step 1: Applying Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem\n\n### Thought Process\n\nFermat\u2019s Little Theorem states that if \\(p\\) is a prime and \\(a\\) is an integer not divisible by \\(p\\), then:\n\n\\[\na^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\n\\]\n\nIn our case:\n- \\(p = 11\\)\n- \\(a = 333\\)\n\nBut first, I need to check if \\(333\\) is divisible by \\(11\\).\n\n- **Quick Check:** \\(333\\) divided by \\(11\\) gives exactly \\(30\\) with no remainder, so \\(333\\) is **not divisible** by \\(11\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me double-check:\n\n\\[\n333 \\div 11 = 30 \\text{ remainder } 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 333 = 11 \\times 30 + 3\n\\]\n\n- **Correction:** So, \\(333\\) is **not divisible** by \\(11\\); it leaves a remainder of \\(3\\).\n\nAlright, with that clarified, Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem applies.\n\n### Applying the Theorem\n\nAccording to Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem:\n\n\\[\n333^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\n\\]\n\nBut our exponent is \\(333\\), so I need to express \\(333\\) in terms of multiples of \\(10\\).\n\n## Step 2: Reducing the Exponent\n\n### Thought Process\n\nI can write \\(333\\) as:\n\n\\[\n333 = 10 \\times 33 + 3\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n333^{333} = (333^{10})^{33} \\times 333^3\n\\]\n\nUsing Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem:\n\n\\[\n(333^{10})^{33} \\equiv 1^{33} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nThis simplifies our problem significantly. Now, I only need to calculate \\(333^3 \\mod 11\\).\n\n## Step 3: Calculating \\(333^3 \\mod 11\\)\n\n### Thought Process\n\nFirst, let's reduce \\(333\\) modulo \\(11\\):\n\n\\[\n333 \\div 11 = 30 \\text{ remainder } 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 333 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}\n\\]\n\n### Calculation\n\nNow, we need to compute \\(3^3 \\mod 11\\):\n\n\\[\n3^3 = 27\n\\]\n\n\\[\n27 \\div 11 = 2 \\text{ remainder } 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 27 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nSo, \\(333^3 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}\\). This means that:\n\n\\[\n333^{333} \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}\n\\]\n\n## Step 4: Verifying the Solution\n\n### Thought Process\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let\u2019s double-check the steps to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Applied Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem:** \n   - Confirmed that \\(333^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}\\).\n   - Reduced the exponent \\(333\\) to \\(10 \\times 33 + 3\\).\n\n2. **Calculated \\(333^3 \\mod 11\\):**\n   - Reduced \\(333\\) to \\(3 \\pmod{11}\\).\n   - Computed \\(3^3 = 27\\) and found \\(27 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}\\).\n\n### Reflection\n\nEverything checks out. The calculations are consistent, and the application of the theorem is correct.\n\n<ANSWER>5</ANSWER>\n\n## Final Answer\n\nThe remainder when \\(333^{333}\\) is divided by \\(11\\) is **5**.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy exploring different strategies, identifying the most efficient one (Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem combined with modular arithmetic), and carefully applying it step by step, I arrived at the correct remainder. Regular reflection and verification ensured that any potential errors were caught and corrected along the way.\n\n---\n\n**Recap:**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Explored multiple strategies, identified Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem as the best fit.\n- **Application:** Used the theorem to simplify the exponent.\n- **Calculation:** Reduced the base and computed the necessary power modulo \\(11\\).\n- **Verification:** Double-checked all steps to confirm the correctness.\n- **Final Answer:** Successfully determined the remainder as **5**.\n\nBy maintaining a clear and structured approach, integrating reflections, and verifying each step, the solution remains robust and error-free.",
  "ground_truth": "We use the property that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$.\n\n$333 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$, therefore $333^{333} \\equiv 3^{333} \\pmod{11}$.\n\nSince $3^5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, we get that $333^{333} \\equiv 3^{333}=3^{5 \\cdot 66 +3}=(3^5)^{66} \\cdot 3^3 \\equiv 1^{66} \\cdot 27 \\equiv \\boxed{5} \\pmod{11}$."
