  "solution": "### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this question:\n\n**\u201cLet GCF(a, b) be the abbreviation for the greatest common factor of a and b, and let LCM(c, d) be the abbreviation for the least common multiple of c and d. What is GCF(LCM(8, 14), LCM(7, 12))?\u201d**\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see this, my brain immediately recognizes the need to deal with both **GCF (Greatest Common Factor)** and **LCM (Least Common Multiple)**. It feels like a layered problem where I need to compute LCMs first and then find the GCF of those results.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- **First Step:** Calculate LCM(8, 14) and LCM(7, 12).\n- **Second Step:** Find the GCF of the two LCM results.\n\nBut wait... is there a more efficient way to tackle this? Maybe a property or relationship between GCF and LCM could simplify things. Let's explore.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Compute LCMs Directly Then GCF**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nCalculating the LCMs directly seems straightforward, but it might be time-consuming. Still, it's a valid approach, so let's start here.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Find LCM(8, 14).\n- Find LCM(7, 12).\n- Then compute GCF of these two LCMs.\n\n**Let's Proceed with This Strategy.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating LCM(8, 14)**\n\nI remember that the LCM of two numbers can be found using their prime factorizations or by using the formula involving GCF:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCF}(a, b)}\n\\]\n\nBut since we're computing LCMs directly, let's try **prime factorization**.\n\n**Prime Factorization:**\n\n- **8:**\n  - \\(8 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^3\\)\n\n- **14:**\n  - \\(14 = 2 \\times 7 = 2^1 \\times 7^1\\)\n\n**LCM Calculation:**\n\nFor LCM, take the highest power of each prime present:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(8, 14) = 2^3 \\times 7^1 = 8 \\times 7 = 56\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDo 8 and 14 both divide 56 evenly?\n\n- \\(56 \\div 8 = 7\\)\n- \\(56 \\div 14 = 4\\)  \n\nSo, yes, this seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating LCM(7, 12)**\n\nAgain, let's use **prime factorization**.\n\n**Prime Factorization:**\n\n- **7:**\n  - \\(7 = 7^1\\)\n\n- **12:**\n  - \\(12 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 2^2 \\times 3^1\\)\n\n**LCM Calculation:**\n\nTake the highest power of each prime:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(7, 12) = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 84\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDo 7 and 12 both divide 84 evenly?\n\n- \\(84 \\div 7 = 12\\)\n- \\(84 \\div 12 = 7\\)  \n\nSo, this is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating GCF(56, 84)**\n\nNow, we need to find the GCF of 56 and 84. I recall that the GCF can be found using **prime factorization** or the **Euclidean algorithm**. Let's try prime factorization first.\n\n**Prime Factorization of 56 and 84:**\n\n- **56:**\n  - \\(56 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 7 = 2^3 \\times 7^1\\)\n\n- **84:**\n  - \\(84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1\\)\n\n**GCF Calculation:**\n\nTake the lowest power of each common prime:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(56, 84) = 2^2 \\times 7^1 = 4 \\times 7 = 28\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes 28 divide both 56 and 84?\n\n- \\(56 \\div 28 = 2\\)\n- \\(84 \\div 28 = 3\\)  \n\nSo, yes, 28 is indeed the GCF.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Using GCF and LCM Properties**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nMaybe there's a mathematical property that relates GCF and LCM that could simplify this process. I vaguely remember that for any two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) = a \\times b\n\\]\n\nBut I'm not sure how to directly apply this to our problem since we're dealing with four different numbers. Perhaps it's not applicable here.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince this property doesn't seem to fit directly, it's better to stick with the first strategy.\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Visualizing with Venn Diagrams**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAnother idea is to visualize the prime factors using Venn diagrams to see the overlap, which represents the GCF, and the total area, which represents the LCM. However, this seems more complicated for four numbers and might not be helpful. I think it's best to proceed with the direct computation method.\n\n---\n\n### **Executing Strategy 1: Final Steps**\n\nSince Strategy 1 is straightforward and checks out, let's finalize the answer.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe greatest common factor of the least common multiples is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCF}(56, 84) = 28\n\\]\n\n**<ANSWER>28</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies, including direct computation, properties of GCF and LCM, and visual methods, it's clear that computing the LCMs first and then finding their GCF is the most straightforward approach. The final answer is **28**.\n\n---\n\nNow, let's put it all together into a clear, coherent solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Complete Solution**\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two least common multiples (LCMs):  \n\\[  \n\\text{GCF}(\\text{LCM}(8, 14), \\text{LCM}(7, 12))  \n\\]\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nCompute the LCMs of the given pairs and then find the GCF of those results. Let's proceed step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Calculating LCM(8, 14)**\n\n- **Prime Factorization:**\n\n  - 8 = \\(2^3\\)  \n  - 14 = \\(2^1 \\times 7^1\\)\n\n- **LCM Calculation:**  \n  Take the highest power of each prime:  \n  \\[  \n  \\text{LCM}(8, 14) = 2^3 \\times 7^1 = 8 \\times 7 = 56  \n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Both 8 and 14 divide 56 evenly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculating LCM(7, 12)**\n\n- **Prime Factorization:**\n\n  - 7 = \\(7^1\\)  \n  - 12 = \\(2^2 \\times 3^1\\)\n\n- **LCM Calculation:**  \n  Take the highest power of each prime:  \n  \\[  \n  \\text{LCM}(7, 12) = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 84  \n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Both 7 and 12 divide 84 evenly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculating GCF(56, 84)**\n\n- **Prime Factorization:**\n\n  - 56 = \\(2^3 \\times 7^1\\)  \n  - 84 = \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1\\)\n\n- **GCF Calculation:**  \n  Take the lowest power of each common prime:  \n  \\[  \n  \\text{GCF}(56, 84) = 2^2 \\times 7^1 = 4 \\times 7 = 28  \n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  28 divides both 56 and 84 evenly.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(\\text{GCF}(56, 84) = 28\\)\n\n**<ANSWER>28</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBy directly calculating the LCMs of the given pairs and then finding their GCF, we determine that the greatest common factor is **28**. Alternative strategies were considered but deemed less efficient for this problem.\n\n---\n\nThat's it! We've walked through the problem step by step, confirming our approach and verifying each part to ensure accuracy.",
