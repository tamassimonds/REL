  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it just like I would if I were solving it on paper\u2014thinking through different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and adjusting as needed. Let's begin by really understanding what's being asked.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n- **Brainstorming:**  \n  Okay, so we have a group of fewer than 500 freshmen. When they line up in columns of 23, there's a remainder of 22 people. Similarly, when lined up in columns of 21, there's a remainder of 14. This feels like a **remainder** or **modulo** problem I\u2019ve encountered before.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  It reminds me of the Chinese Remainder Theorem or problems involving **congruences**. But I'm not entirely sure yet. Let's explore.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Using Congruences:**  \n   - We have:\n     - \\( N \\equiv 22 \\pmod{23} \\)\n     - \\( N \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21} \\)\n\n2. **Thinking of It as a System of Equations:**  \n   - Solving these congruences simultaneously could lead us to the solution.\n\n3. **Maybe Guess and Check?**  \n   - Given that \\( N < 500 \\), I could start checking numbers manually that fit both conditions. But this might be time-consuming.\n\n4. **Wait, Could There Be a Better Way?**  \n   - Perhaps using the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** and adjusting for remainders could be more efficient.\n\n### **Starting with Congruences**\n\n- **Initial Approach:**  \n  Let's try solving the congruences step by step.\n\n#### **Step 1: Express the First Congruence**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  From \\( N \\equiv 22 \\pmod{23} \\), I can write:\n  \\[\n  N = 23k + 22\n  \\]\n  for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n- **Check:**  \n  This makes sense. When divided by 23, \\( N \\) leaves a remainder of 22.\n\n#### **Step 2: Plug into the Second Congruence**\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Substitute \\( N \\) from the first equation into the second congruence:\n  \\[\n  23k + 22 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplifying:**  \n  - First, subtract 22 from both sides:\n    \\[\n    23k \\equiv -8 \\pmod{21}\n    \\]\n  - But let's make the remainder positive by adding 21:\n    \\[\n    23k \\equiv 13 \\pmod{21}\n    \\]\n  - Since 23 is congruent to 2 modulo 21 (because 23 - 21 = 2), I can simplify further:\n    \\[\n    2k \\equiv 13 \\pmod{21}\n    \\]\n\n#### **Step 3: Solving for \\( k \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Now, I need to solve \\( 2k \\equiv 13 \\pmod{21} \\). This is a linear congruence.\n\n- **Brainstorming:**  \n  I can try finding the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 21 to isolate \\( k \\).\n\n- **Finding the Inverse:**  \n  I need \\( x \\) such that \\( 2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{21} \\).\n  - Testing small numbers:\n    - \\( 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\)\n    - \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\)\n    - ...\n    - \\( 2 \\times 11 = 22 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{21} \\)\n  - **Eureka!** So, the inverse is 11.\n\n- **Applying the Inverse:**  \n  Multiply both sides of \\( 2k \\equiv 13 \\) by 11:\n  \\[\n  k \\equiv 143 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  Since 143 divided by 21 gives a remainder of 17:\n  \\[\n  k \\equiv 17 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n\n#### **Step 4: Finding \\( N \\)**\n\n- **Substitute Back:**  \n  From \\( N = 23k + 22 \\) and \\( k \\equiv 17 \\pmod{21} \\):\n  \\[\n  k = 21m + 17\n  \\]\n  for some integer \\( m \\).\n\n- **Plugging Into \\( N \\):**  \n  \\[\n  N = 23(21m + 17) + 22 \\\\\n  N = 483m + 391\n  \\]\n  \n- **General Solution:**  \n  So, \\( N = 483m + 391 \\).\n\n#### **Step 5: Applying the Upper Limit \\( N < 500 \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  We know \\( N < 500 \\), so let's find the appropriate \\( m \\).\n\n- **Calculating:**\n  \\[\n  483m + 391 < 500 \\\\\n  483m < 109 \\\\\n  m < \\frac{109}{483} \\approx 0.225\n  \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Since \\( m \\) must be a non-negative integer, the only possible value is \\( m = 0 \\).\n\n- **Final Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  N = 483(0) + 391 = 391\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:**  \n  Does \\( N = 391 \\) satisfy both original conditions?\n  - \\( 391 \\div 23 = 17 \\) remainder 22 \u2714\ufe0f\n  - \\( 391 \\div 21 = 18 \\) remainder 13 \u274c\n\n- **Wait, Something\u2019s Off:**  \n  The second condition isn't satisfied. I must have made an error somewhere. Let me retrace my steps.\n\n### **Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Looking back, the remainder for the second condition should be 14, but my solution gives a remainder of 13. I need to revisit my calculations.\n\n- **Possible Mistake:**  \n  Let's check the simplification after subtracting remainders.\n\n#### **Step 2 Revisited: Correcting the Substitution**\n\n- **Original Substitution:**  \n  \\[\n  23k + 22 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Subtract 22 from Both Sides:**  \n  \\[\n  23k \\equiv -8 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Making Remainder Positive:**  \n  \\[\n  23k \\equiv -8 + 21 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying 23 modulo 21:**  \n  \\[\n  2k \\equiv 13 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n\n#### **Step 4 Revisited: Calculating \\( N \\) Again**\n\n- **Substitute Back:**  \n  \\[\n  N = 23(21m + 17) + 22 \\\\\n  N = 483m + 391\n  \\]\n  \n- **Applying \\( m = 0 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  N = 391\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check Again:**  \n  - \\( N = 391 \\):\n    - \\( 391 \\div 23 = 17 \\) remainder 22 \u2714\ufe0f\n    - \\( 391 \\div 21 = 18 \\) remainder **13** \u274c\n  \n- **Realization:**  \n  The error persists. Hmm, perhaps the initial substitution was incorrect, or there's another layer I'm missing.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Adjusting the Second Congruence**\n\n- **New Approach:**  \n  Let's reconsider the second condition. Maybe I misinterpreted the remainders.\n\n#### **Step 2 Alternative: Correcting the Second Congruence**\n\n- **Original Second Congruence:**  \n  \\[\n  N \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Substituting \\( N = 23k + 22 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  23k + 22 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Subtract 22 from Both Sides:**  \n  \\[\n  23k \\equiv -8 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Making Remainder Positive:**  \n  \\[\n  23k \\equiv 13 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying 23 modulo 21:**  \n  \\[\n  2k \\equiv 13 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Finding Inverse of 2 mod 21:**  \n  As before, the inverse is 11.\n  \n- **Multiplying Both Sides by 11:**  \n  \\[\n  k \\equiv 143 \\pmod{21} \\\\\n  k \\equiv 17 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  \n#### **Step 4 Alternative: Recalculating \\( N \\)**\n\n- **Substitute Back:**  \n  \\[\n  N = 23(21m + 17) + 22 \\\\\n  N = 483m + 391\n  \\]\n  \n- **Applying \\( m = 0 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  N = 391\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check Again:**  \n  - \\( N = 391 \\):\n    - \\( 391 \\div 23 = 17 \\) remainder 22 \u2714\ufe0f\n    - \\( 391 \\div 21 = 18 \\) remainder **13** \u274c\n  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The mistake persists, indicating an error in the initial approach.\n\n### **Reflecting on the Mistake**\n\n- **Realization:**  \n  The second condition is not being satisfied, which suggests that my initial substitution or simplification might be flawed.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy:**  \n  Perhaps I need to adjust the way I'm handling the remainders or consider a different method altogether.\n\n### **New Strategy: Using the Least Common Multiple (LCM) Approach**\n\n- **Brainstorming:**  \n  Let's consider that the solution must satisfy both remainders simultaneously. Maybe aligning the multiples of 23 and 21 with their respective remainders could help.\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  If I can find a common multiple that satisfies both conditions within the limit of 500, that should be our answer.\n\n#### **Step 1: Aligning Multiples of 23 with Remainder 22**\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  The numbers that leave a remainder of 22 when divided by 23 are:\n  \\[\n  23 \\times 1 + 22 = 45, \\\\\n  23 \\times 2 + 22 = 68, \\\\\n  23 \\times 3 + 22 = 91, \\\\\n  \\ldots\n  \\]\n  \n- **Listing Out:**  \n  I\u2019ll list these until I reach close to 500.\n\n#### **Step 2: Checking Which of These Also Leave a Remainder of 14 When Divided by 21**\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  For each number from Step 1, I'll check if dividing by 21 leaves a remainder of 14.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  Let's check a few:\n  - \\( 45 \\div 21 = 2 \\) remainder 3 \u274c\n  - \\( 68 \\div 21 = 3 \\) remainder 5 \u274c\n  - \\( 91 \\div 21 = 4 \\) remainder 7 \u274c\n  - \\(\\ldots\\)\n  \n- **Wait a Minute:**  \n  This could get tedious. Perhaps there's a pattern or a better way to streamline this.\n\n#### **Step 3: Finding a Pattern or Shortcut**\n\n- **Brainstorming:**  \n  Maybe I can express the condition algebraically to find a pattern.\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Let\u2019s see if there\u2019s a linear relationship that can be exploited.\n\n#### **Step 4: Revisiting the Original Congruences**\n\n- **Original Congruences:**  \n  - \\( N \\equiv 22 \\pmod{23} \\)\n  - \\( N \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21} \\)\n  \n- **Expressing \\( N \\):**  \n  From the first congruence:\n  \\[\n  N = 23k + 22\n  \\]\n  \n- **Substituting into the Second Congruence:**  \n  \\[\n  23k + 22 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying:**  \n  \\[\n  23k \\equiv -8 \\pmod{21} \\\\\n  23k \\equiv 13 \\pmod{21} \\quad (\\text{since } -8 + 21 = 13)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Realization:**  \n  As before, simplifying \\( 23k \\equiv 13 \\pmod{21} \\) leads to \\( 2k \\equiv 13 \\pmod{21} \\).\n\n- **Finding \\( k \\):**  \n  Using the inverse of 2 modulo 21, which is 11:\n  \\[\n  k \\equiv 143 \\pmod{21} \\\\\n  k \\equiv 17 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Substituting Back into \\( N \\):**  \n  \\[\n  N = 23(21m + 17) + 22 \\\\\n  N = 483m + 391\n  \\]\n  \n- **Applying \\( m = 0 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  N = 391\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check Again:**  \n  - \\( N = 391 \\):\n    - \\( 391 \\div 23 = 17 \\) remainder 22 \u2714\ufe0f\n    - \\( 391 \\div 21 = 18 \\) remainder **13** \u274c\n  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The mistake persists. This suggests a fundamental error in the initial approach.\n\n### **Final Strategy: Adjusting the Initial Congruence Approach**\n\n- **New Thought Process:**  \n  Given that the original approach isn't yielding a correct solution, perhaps there's a misinterpretation in handling the remainders. Let's revisit the congruences with a different perspective.\n\n#### **Step 1: Re-expressing the Congruences**\n\n- **First Congruence:**  \n  \\[\n  N \\equiv -1 \\pmod{23} \\quad (\\text{since } 23 - 22 = 1)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Second Congruence:**  \n  \\[\n  N \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Alternative Expression:**  \n  This can be rephrased as:\n  \\[\n  N + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{23} \\\\\n  N \\equiv 14 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  \n#### **Step 2: Setting Up the System**\n\n- **Expressing \\( N + 1 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  N + 1 = 23k\n  \\]\n  for some integer \\( k \\).\n  \n- **Substituting into the Second Congruence:**  \n  \\[\n  23k \\equiv 15 \\pmod{21} \\quad (\\text{since } 14 + 1 = 15)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying:**  \n  \\[\n  2k \\equiv 15 \\pmod{21}\n  \\]\n  (Since \\( 23 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{21} \\))\n  \n#### **Step 3: Solving for \\( k \\)**\n\n- **Finding the Inverse of 2 mod 21:**  \n  As before, the inverse is 11.\n  \n- **Multiplying Both Sides by 11:**  \n  \\[\n  k \\equiv 165 \\pmod{21} \\\\\n  k \\equiv 18 \\pmod{21} \\quad (\\text{since } 165 \\div 21 = 7 \\text{ remainder } 18)\n  \\]\n  \n#### **Step 4: Finding \\( N \\)**\n\n- **Expressing \\( N \\):**  \n  \\[\n  N = 23k - 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Substituting \\( k = 21m + 18 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  N = 23(21m + 18) - 1 \\\\\n  N = 483m + 414 - 1 \\\\\n  N = 483m + 413\n  \\]\n  \n#### **Step 5: Applying the Upper Limit \\( N < 500 \\)**\n\n- **Calculating:**\n  \\[\n  483m + 413 < 500 \\\\\n  483m < 87 \\\\\n  m < \\frac{87}{483} \\approx 0.18\n  \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Since \\( m \\) must be a non-negative integer, the only possible value is \\( m = 0 \\).\n\n- **Final Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  N = 483(0) + 413 = 413\n  \\]\n  \n#### **Step 6: Verifying the Solution**\n\n- **Check Both Conditions:**  \n  - \\( N = 413 \\):\n    - **Columns of 23:**\n      \\[\n      413 \\div 23 = 17 \\text{ remainder } 22 \u2714\ufe0f\n      \\]\n    - **Columns of 21:**\n      \\[\n      413 \\div 21 = 19 \\text{ remainder } 14 \u2714\ufe0f\n      \\]\n  \n- **Validation:**  \n  Both conditions are satisfied. Therefore, \\( N = 413 \\) is the correct solution.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{413}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Initially, there was a minor miscalculation in handling the remainders, leading to an incorrect solution. By revisiting and adjusting the approach, the correct number of freshmen was determined.\n\n- **Lessons Learned:**  \n  It's crucial to verify each step, especially when dealing with congruences, to ensure that all conditions are satisfied. Being open to revisiting and adjusting strategies is key to arriving at the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "If $n$ is the number of people in the incoming class, then $n$ yields a remainder of $14$ when divided by $21$. Since both 21 and 14 are divisible by 7, this means that $n$ is divisible by $7$. Define $k=n/7$, and note that $7k \\equiv 14\\pmod{21}$. Dividing by 7, we get $k\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. Multiplying by 7 again, we get $n\\equiv 14\\pmod{3}$, which implies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. So we are looking for a solution to the following system of linear congruences: \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}, \\\\\nn&\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3},\\\\\nn&\\equiv 22 \\pmod{23}. \\\\\n\\end{align*} First, we look for a solution to the last two congruences. Checking numbers that are one less than a multiple of 23, we find that 68 satisfies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $n$ which satisfy both of the last two congruences are precisely those that differ from 68 by a multiple of $3\\cdot 23=69$. Checking $68+69$, $68+2\\cdot 69$, etc. we find that $68 + 5\\cdot 69 = \\boxed{413}$ is the least positive solution to the last two congruences which is also divisible by 7. Note that, by the Chinese remainder theorem again, the solutions of the above system of three congruences are precisely the positive integers that differ from 413 by a multiple of $7\\cdot3\\cdot23=483,$ so 413 is indeed the only solution between 0 and 500."
