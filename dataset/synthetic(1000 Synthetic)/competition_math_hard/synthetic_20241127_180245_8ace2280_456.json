  "solution": "Absolutely, let's put everything together into a smooth and cohesive solution while retaining the original thought process. I'll ensure it flows naturally, reflecting genuine problem-solving steps, including brainstorming, checking, and adjusting strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at this expression:  \n\\[\n\\frac{2^{n+4} - 2(2^n)}{2(2^{n+3})}\n\\]  \nit seems like a typical algebraic fraction simplification problem involving exponents. My **initial instinct** is to try and factor out common terms in the numerator to see if anything cancels with the denominator.\n\nBut wait, let's **brainstorm different strategies** before diving in:\n\n1. **Factoring Out Common Terms:** Maybe there's a common factor in the numerator that can simplify things.\n   \n2. **Simplifying Exponents:** Perhaps rewriting the exponents could make the expression easier to handle.\n   \n3. **Canceling Out Variables:** See if components in the numerator and denominator can cancel each other out.\n\n**Honestly**, factoring out common terms seems the most straightforward, so I'll start there. But if it doesn't work, I'll explore the other options.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Factoring Out Common Terms in the Numerator**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet me look at the numerator: \\(2^{n+4} - 2(2^n)\\). Both terms have a base of 2 raised to a power, which suggests I might be able to factor out the lowest power of 2.\n\n**Action:**  \nFactor out \\(2^n\\) from the numerator.\n\n\\[\n2^{n+4} - 2(2^n) = 2^n \\cdot 2^4 - 2 \\cdot 2^n = 2^n (16 - 2)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n2^n (16 - 2) = 2^n (14)\n\\]\n\nSo, the numerator becomes:\n\n\\[\n14 \\cdot 2^n\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat worked out neatly! Now the numerator is \\(14 \\cdot 2^n\\). This should make simplification easier. I'll proceed to the next step and see if this helps in canceling out terms with the denominator.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe denominator is \\(2(2^{n+3})\\). I can simplify this by recognizing that multiplying exponents with the same base is equivalent to adding their exponents.\n\n**Action:**  \nSimplify the denominator:\n\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 2^{n+3} = 2^{1} \\cdot 2^{n+3} = 2^{n+4}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute! Let me **double-check** that:\n\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 2^{n+3} = 2^{1} \\cdot 2^{n+3} = 2^{n+4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nYes, that\u2019s correct. So the denominator simplifies to \\(2^{n+4}\\). Now, my expression looks like this:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14 \\cdot 2^n}{2^{n+4}}\n\\]\n\nThis simplification seems promising. Next, I'll see if I can cancel out the powers of 2.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Canceling Out the Powers of 2**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI have \\(2^n\\) in the numerator and \\(2^{n+4}\\) in the denominator. It looks like I can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^n\\).\n\n**Action:**  \nDivide both numerator and denominator by \\(2^n\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14 \\cdot 2^n}{2^{n+4}} = \\frac{14 \\cdot \\cancel{2^n}}{\\cancel{2^n} \\cdot 2^4} = \\frac{14}{2^4}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate \\(2^4\\):\n\n\\[\n2^4 = 16\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14}{16}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks good so far. But I notice that \\( \\frac{14}{16} \\) can be reduced further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Simplifying the Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo ensure the fraction is in its simplest form, I'll divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2.\n\n**Action:**  \nSimplify \\( \\frac{14}{16} \\) by dividing both terms by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14 \\div 2}{16 \\div 2} = \\frac{7}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat worked perfectly. Now the fraction is in its simplest form, \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\). I'll do a quick check to make sure everything is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Quick Check to Verify the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing the answer, let me review each step to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n- **Factoring the Numerator:** Factored out \\(2^n\\) correctly to get \\(14 \\cdot 2^n\\).\n- **Simplifying the Denominator:** Simplified \\(2 \\cdot 2^{n+3}\\) to \\(2^{n+4}\\) correctly.\n- **Canceling Powers of 2:** Divided both numerator and denominator by \\(2^n\\) to simplify to \\( \\frac{14}{16} \\).\n- **Reducing the Fraction:** Simplified \\( \\frac{14}{16} \\) to \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) by dividing by 2.\n\nEverything **checks out**.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNo errors detected. The solution pathway was correct, and the final answer makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Final Solution**\n\n\\(\\frac{2^{n+4} - 2(2^n)}{2(2^{n+3})} = \\frac{7}{8}\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy **exploring different strategies** and carefully applying each step, I simplified the original expression to \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\). **Regular checks** along the way ensured the correctness of the solution, and being open to adjusting the approach helped maintain accuracy throughout the process.\n\n---\n\nThere you have it! A complete, coherent solution with a natural flow, incorporating genuine reflections and verifications at each step.",
