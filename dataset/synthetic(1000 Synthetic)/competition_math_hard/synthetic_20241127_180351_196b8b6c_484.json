  "solution": "### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. The question is about a trip from Carville to Nikpath that takes \\(4\\frac{1}{2}\\) hours at 70 miles per hour (mph). We need to figure out how long the same trip would take at 60 mph.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- This looks like a time, speed, and distance problem.\n- I remember the basic formula:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n  \\]\n- Maybe I can find the distance first, then use it to find the new time at 60 mph.\n\nBut wait, is there another way? Let's brainstorm a bit.\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Calculation Using the Formula:**\n   - Calculate the total distance using the initial speed and time.\n   - Then, use that distance with the new speed to find the time.\n\n2. **Proportional Reasoning:**\n   - Since speed decreases, the time should increase proportionally.\n   - Maybe set up a proportion between the two speeds and times.\n\n3. **Unit Rate Approach:**\n   - Calculate how much time it takes per mile at each speed.\n   - Then multiply by the total distance.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The **Direct Calculation** method seems straightforward. Let's start with that.\n- If it feels too complicated, I can switch to **Proportional Reasoning**.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Total Distance**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's use the given speed and time to find the total distance of the trip.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 70 \\, \\text{mph} \\times 4.5 \\, \\text{hours}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, \\(4\\frac{1}{2}\\) hours is the same as 4.5 hours. Just checking to make sure.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n70 \\times 4.5 = 315 \\, \\text{miles}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- \\(70 \\times 4 = 280\\), and \\(70 \\times 0.5 = 35\\). Adding them gives \\(280 + 35 = 315\\).\n- Yup, that seems right.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- The total distance is 315 miles. This makes sense for a 4.5-hour trip at 70 mph.\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Time at 60 mph**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to find out how long it takes to travel 315 miles at 60 mph.  \nUsing the formula rearranged:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{315 \\, \\text{miles}}{60 \\, \\text{mph}}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{315}{60} = 5.25 \\, \\text{hours}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- \\(60 \\times 5 = 300\\), and \\(60 \\times 0.25 = 15\\). Adding them gives \\(300 + 15 = 315\\).\n- So, \\(5.25 \\times 60 = 315\\). That checks out.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- The calculation seems correct. The trip takes 5.25 hours at 60 mph.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Proportional Reasoning**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nJust to double-check, let's see if proportional reasoning gives the same result.  \nThe speeds are in a ratio of \\( \\frac{70}{60} = \\frac{7}{6} \\).  \nTherefore, the time should increase by the inverse ratio: \\( \\frac{6}{7} \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n4.5 \\times \\frac{7}{6} = 5.25 \\, \\text{hours}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- Multiplying \\(4.5\\) by \\( \\frac{7}{6} \\) should increase the time as expected.\n- \\(4.5 \\times 1 = 4.5\\), and \\(4.5 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.75\\), so \\(4.5 + 0.75 = 5.25\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Both methods agree. That's reassuring.\n\n### **Final Check: Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSlowing down from 70 mph to 60 mph should increase the travel time.  \nThe original time was 4.5 hours, and the new time is 5.25 hours, which is longer. That makes sense.\n\n**Intuition Check:**  \n- Reducing speed by about 14% (since \\( \\frac{70-60}{70} \\approx 0.14 \\)), the time increases proportionally.\n- The increase in time is \\(5.25 - 4.5 = 0.75\\) hours, or 45 minutes. That feels reasonable for a 10 mph decrease over a long trip.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and reflecting at each step, we find that the trip requires **5.25 hours** when traveling at an average speed of 60 mph.\n\n<ANSWER>5.25 hours</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \n- Starting with the direct calculation was effective, but validating with proportional reasoning strengthened confidence in the answer.\n- Regular checks along the way ensured that no mistakes were made.\n- Thinking through the problem step-by-step helped in maintaining accuracy and avoiding errors.",
  "ground_truth": "Since $\\text{distance}=\\text{rate}\\times\\text{time}$, decreasing speed by a factor of $\\frac{6}{7}$ increases the amount of time the trip takes by $\\frac{7}{6}$.  Therefore, at 60 miles per hour the trip takes $4\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{7}{6}=\\frac{9}{2}\\cdot\\frac{7}{6}=\\frac{21}{4}=\\boxed{5.25}$ hours."
