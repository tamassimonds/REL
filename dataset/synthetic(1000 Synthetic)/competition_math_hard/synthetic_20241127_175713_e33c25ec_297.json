  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it manually. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, checking each step, and adjusting my approach as needed. I'll reflect often to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, the question asks for the product of all positive integral values of \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 - 35n + 306 = p \\) for some prime number \\( p \\). \n\n**Initial Reaction:** This looks like a quadratic equation, and I need to find \\( n \\) values that make the expression equal to a prime.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Quadratic Equation Approach:** Maybe I can factor the quadratic or use the quadratic formula.\n- **Prime Conditions:** Since \\( p \\) is prime, perhaps I can set \\( p \\) to specific prime numbers and see which \\( n \\) work.\n- **Completing the Square:** Another technique for solving quadratics.\n- **Graphical Interpretation:** Visualize the parabola and see where it intersects prime numbers.\n\nI'm not entirely sure which method will be the most efficient, so let's explore them one by one.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Quadratic Equation Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI'll start by trying to factor the quadratic equation \\( n^2 - 35n + 306 = p \\). If I can factor it, I might be able to find the integral values of \\( n \\) easily.\n\n**Attempting to Factor:**\n\n- The equation is \\( n^2 - 35n + 306 - p = 0 \\).\n- So, \\( n^2 - 35n + (306 - p) = 0 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nFactoring quadratics manually can be tricky, especially with an unknown like \\( p \\). **Wait, that can't be right because...** I don't have a specific value for \\( p \\), making factoring difficult.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFactoring doesn't seem practical here unless I know \\( p \\). **Hmm, maybe I need to back up and try...** another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Trying the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's use the quadratic formula to solve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{35 \\pm \\sqrt{35^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (306 - p)}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{35 \\pm \\sqrt{1225 - 1224 + 4p}}{2} = \\frac{35 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4p}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nFor \\( n \\) to be an integer, \\( \\sqrt{1 + 4p} \\) must be an integer. **Oh! This reminds me of...** perfect squares. So, \\( 1 + 4p \\) must be a perfect square.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis leads me to set \\( 1 + 4p = k^2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Let's proceed with this.\n\n---\n\n### **Formulating an Equation**\n\n\\[\n1 + 4p = k^2 \\implies 4p = k^2 - 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{{k^2 - 1}}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSince \\( p \\) must be a prime number, \\( \\frac{{k^2 - 1}}{4} \\) needs to be prime. **Let me think about whether this approach makes sense...** I need \\( k^2 - 1 \\) to be divisible by 4 and result in a prime.\n\n**Observation:**  \n\\( k^2 - 1 \\) factors as \\( (k - 1)(k + 1) \\). These are two consecutive even numbers, so their product is divisible by 4.\n\n**Next Step:**  \nI'll iterate over possible integer values of \\( k \\) to see when \\( \\frac{{k^2 - 1}}{4} \\) yields a prime.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking Different Strategies**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBefore diving deeper, **maybe I should explore another strategy just in case.** Perhaps setting specific small prime values for \\( p \\) and solving for \\( n \\) could work better. Let's brainstorm:\n\n- **Set \\( p \\) to Small Primes:** Like 2, 3, 5, etc., and see if the equation yields integer \\( n \\).\n- **Check for Patterns:** Look for any patterns in the solutions to predict other \\( n \\) values.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLet's try setting \\( p \\) to small prime numbers and see what happens.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 1: Assigning Small Prime Values to \\( p \\) and Solving for \\( n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI'll start by assigning small prime values to \\( p \\) and see if the quadratic equation yields positive integral \\( n \\).\n\n**Attempt:**  \nLet\u2019s use \\( p = 2 \\), a small prime.\n\n\\[\nn^2 - 35n + 306 = 2 \\implies n^2 - 35n + 304 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Using the Quadratic Formula:**\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{{35 \\pm \\sqrt{{35^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 304}}}}{2} = \\frac{{35 \\pm \\sqrt{{1225 - 1216}}}}{2} = \\frac{{35 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{{35 \\pm 3}}{2} \\implies n = 19 \\text{ or } 16\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth \\( n = 19 \\) and \\( n = 16 \\) are positive integers. **Oh! This works!** But wait, can there be more solutions with different primes?\n\n**Next Step:**  \nLet\u2019s try another small prime to see if other \\( n \\) values exist. **Actually, this might be a good way to proceed...**\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 1 Continued: Assigning Another Small Prime \\( p = 3 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s see if \\( p = 3 \\) yields additional \\( n \\) values.\n\n\\[\nn^2 - 35n + 306 = 3 \\implies n^2 - 35n + 303 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Using the Quadratic Formula:**\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{{35 \\pm \\sqrt{{35^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 303}}}}{2} = \\frac{{35 \\pm \\sqrt{{1225 - 1212}}}}{2} = \\frac{{35 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\\(\\sqrt{13}\\) is not an integer, so \\( n \\) is not an integer in this case. **Hmm, maybe I need to back up and try...** a different prime or conclude that not all primes work.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAssigning \\( p = 3 \\) doesn't yield integral \\( n \\). **This suggests that only specific primes will work.**\n\n**Check:**  \nSo far, \\( p = 2 \\) worked, giving us \\( n = 19 \\) and \\( n = 16 \\). **Quick check:**  \n\\[\n19^2 - 35 \\times 19 + 306 = 361 - 665 + 306 = 2 \\quad (\\text{which is prime})\n\\]  \n\\[\n16^2 - 35 \\times 16 + 306 = 256 - 560 + 306 = 2 \\quad (\\text{which is prime})\n\\]  \n**That number seems correct...** Both solutions satisfy the equation with \\( p = 2 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring a Different Strategy: Factoring the Quadratic to Identify Prime \\( p \\) Values**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSince assigning small primes to \\( p \\) partially worked, **let me think about whether this approach makes sense...** Perhaps there's a pattern or a specific condition that primes need to satisfy for \\( n \\) to be integral.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nMaybe I can rearrange the original equation to see under what conditions \\( n^2 - 35n + 306 \\) equals a prime.\n\n**Rearranging the Equation:**\n\n\\[\nn^2 - 35n + 306 - p = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a standard quadratic equation, and for it to have integral solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Discriminant } \\Delta = 35^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (306 - p) = 1225 - 1224 + 4p = 1 + 4p\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{For } n \\text{ to be integral: } 1 + 4p \\text{ must be a perfect square, say } k^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1 + 4p = k^2 \\implies 4p = k^2 - 1 \\implies p = \\frac{{k^2 - 1}}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:**  \nSince \\( p \\) is a prime number, \\( \\frac{{k^2 - 1}}{4} \\) must yield a prime.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis imposes a constraint on \\( k \\): \\( k^2 - 1 \\) must be divisible by 4, and the result must be prime.\n\n**Next Step:**  \nI'll iterate over possible integer values of \\( k \\) to see when \\( \\frac{{k^2 - 1}}{4} \\) yields a prime.\n\n---\n\n### **Iterating Over Possible Values of \\( k \\) to Find Corresponding Primes \\( p \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nStarting with small integer values of \\( k \\), I'll compute \\( p \\) and check if it's prime.\n\n- **For \\( k = 3 \\):**\n\n    \\[\n    p = \\frac{{3^2 - 1}}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2 \\quad (\\text{which is prime})\n    \\]\n    \n    **Reflection:**  \n    **Oh! This works!** So \\( p = 2 \\) is a valid prime. We've already seen that \\( p = 2 \\) yields \\( n = 19 \\) and \\( n = 16 \\).\n\n- **For \\( k = 5 \\):**\n\n    \\[\n    p = \\frac{{5^2 - 1}}{4} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6 \\quad (\\text{which is not prime})\n    \\]\n    \n    **Reflection:**  \n    **Wait, that can't be right because...** 6 is not a prime number. Thus, \\( k = 5 \\) doesn't work.\n\n- **For \\( k = 7 \\):**\n\n    \\[\n    p = \\frac{{7^2 - 1}}{4} = \\frac{48}{4} = 12 \\quad (\\text{which is not prime})\n    \\]\n    \n    **Reflection:**  \n    Again, 12 is not prime. **Hmm, maybe I need to back up and try...** larger values or conclude that only specific \\( k \\) values work.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIt seems that only \\( k = 3 \\) yields a prime \\( p \\). **Actually, this might be a good indication that...** there are only two integral \\( n \\) values corresponding to \\( p = 2 \\).\n\n**Check:**  \n\\[\n1 + 4p = 1 + 4 \\times 2 = 9 = 3^2 \\quad (\\text{a perfect square})\n\\]  \n\\[\nn = \\frac{{35 \\pm 3}}{2} = 19 \\text{ or } 16\n\\]  \n**This confirms that...** our earlier solutions are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Cross-Checking the Solution with an Alternative Strategy: Completing the Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo ensure that \\( n = 19 \\) and \\( n = 16 \\) are the only solutions, let's try completing the square to see if another approach yields the same result.\n\n**Rewriting the Equation:**\n\n\\[\nn^2 - 35n + 306 = p\n\\]\n\n**Completing the Square:**\n\n\\[\nn^2 - 35n = -306 + p\n\\]\n\nAdd and subtract \\(\\left(\\frac{35}{2}\\right)^2 = 306.25\\) to complete the square:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - 35n + 306.25 = -306 + p + 306.25\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(n - 17.5)^2 = p + 0.25\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(n - 17.5)^2 = p + \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( n \\):**\n\n\\[\nn - 17.5 = \\pm \\sqrt{p + \\frac{1}{4}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = 17.5 \\pm \\sqrt{p + \\frac{1}{4}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nFor \\( n \\) to be an integer, \\(\\sqrt{p + \\frac{1}{4}}\\) must be half an integer. **Let me think about whether this approach makes sense...** This seems complicated and doesn't immediately provide new insights. **Maybe I should stick with the previous method...**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nCompleting the square doesn't offer a straightforward additional solution. **Actually, this might be a good indication that...** the earlier method was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Solution Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nGiven that assigning \\( p = 2 \\) yielded valid \\( n \\) values and no other small primes worked, **let me think about whether this approach makes sense...** it seems plausible that these are the only solutions. **But wait, can there be more solutions with larger primes?**\n\n**Check:**  \nTo verify, let's consider whether larger primes could work. **Actually, this might be a good way to...** ensure completeness.\n\n**Calculating for Larger Primes:**\n\n- **Suppose \\( p = 5 \\):**\n\n    \\[\n    n^2 - 35n + 306 = 5 \\implies n^2 - 35n + 301 = 0\n    \\]\n    \n    \\[\n    n = \\frac{{35 \\pm \\sqrt{{35^2 - 4 \\times 301}}}}{2} = \\frac{{35 \\pm \\sqrt{{1225 - 1204}}}}{2} = \\frac{{35 \\pm \\sqrt{21}}}}{2}\n    \\]\n    \n    **Reflection:**  \n    \\(\\sqrt{21}\\) is not an integer, so \\( n \\) is not integral in this case. **This suggests that only specific primes will work.**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAssigning larger primes doesn't yield integral \\( n \\). **This confirms that...** \\( p = 2 \\) is likely the only prime that works, resulting in \\( n = 19 \\) and \\( n = 16 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\nProduct of all positive integral values of \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\n16 \\times 19 = 304\n\\]\n\nsolution\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Does \\( n = 19 \\) and \\( n = 16 \\) Satisfy the Original Equation for \\( p = 2 \\)?**\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\nn = 19:\n\\]\n\\[\n19^2 - 35 \\times 19 + 306 = 361 - 665 + 306 = 2 \\quad (\\text{which is prime})\n\\]\n\\[\nn = 16:\n\\]\n\\[\n16^2 - 35 \\times 16 + 306 = 256 - 560 + 306 = 2 \\quad (\\text{which is prime})\n\\]\nBoth solutions satisfy the equation with \\( p = 2 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n**That number seems correct...** The calculations validate that \\( n = 19 \\) and \\( n = 16 \\) are indeed solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **First Thoughts:** Initially, I considered factoring the quadratic but realized it wasn't practical without knowing \\( p \\). This led me to use the quadratic formula, which pointed towards perfect squares involving \\( p \\).\n\n- **Exploring Different Strategies:**  \n  - Assigning small primes to \\( p \\) worked for \\( p = 2 \\) but not for others like \\( p = 3 \\) or \\( p = 5 \\).\n  - Completing the square didn't yield new insights, reinforcing that only \\( p = 2 \\) provides integral \\( n \\).\n\n- **Checking Correctness:** Each step involved verifying whether the chosen \\( p \\) yielded integer \\( n \\). Only \\( p = 2 \\) did, resulting in \\( n = 19 \\) and \\( n = 16 \\).\n\n- **Final Check:** Calculations confirmed that both \\( n = 19 \\) and \\( n = 16 \\) satisfy the original equation with \\( p = 2 \\).\n\n- **Conclusion:** The product of all positive integral values of \\( n \\) is \\( 304 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n1. **Initial Approach:** Attempted to factor the quadratic equation but found it impractical without knowing \\( p \\).\n  \n2. **Quadratic Formula:** Used the quadratic formula to express \\( n \\) in terms of \\( p \\), leading to the condition that \\( 1 + 4p \\) must be a perfect square.\n  \n3. **Assigning Small Primes:** Tested small prime values for \\( p \\):\n   - \\( p = 2 \\): Yielded \\( n = 19 \\) and \\( n = 16 \\).\n   - \\( p = 3 \\) and larger primes: Did not yield integral \\( n \\).\n\n4. **Confirming Solutions:** Verified that \\( n = 19 \\) and \\( n = 16 \\) satisfy the original equation with \\( p = 2 \\).\n\n5. **Alternative Strategies:** Considered completing the square but found it unhelpful, reinforcing that only \\( p = 2 \\) works.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The product of the positive integral values of \\( n \\) is \\( 304 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**    \n<ANSWER>\n\n\\[\n16 \\times 19 = 304\n\\]\n\nsolution\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n## **Final Summary**\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the solutions, I concluded that the product of all positive integral values of \\( n \\) is \\( 304 \\). Only \\( p = 2 \\) yields valid \\( n \\) values, namely \\( 16 \\) and \\( 19 \\).",
  "ground_truth": "First we note that since $n^2-35n = n(n-35)$, and at least one of $n$ and $n-35$ is even, thus $n^2-35n$ is even. So $n^2-35n+306$ is also even. Thus the prime $p$ must equal 2. This means that we want the product of the positive integral solutions to $n^2-35n+306=2$, or $n^2-35n+304=0$.\n\nThe problem tells us that there is at least one positive integral solution. Now we use the fact that the product of the solutions to a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $c/a$, which equals 304 in this case. This means that both solutions must in fact be positive, since if only one were, their product would be negative. Additionally, the sum of the solutions is given by $-b/a$, which is 35 in this case. Since one solution is integral, and the sum of both solutions is integral, the other solution is integral as well. So we want the product of both, which is $\\boxed{304}$."
