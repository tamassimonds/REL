  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were tackling this on paper, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness, and adjusting as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nLooking at the question:\n\n- **Properties Given:**\n  - Passes through \\((1,5)\\)\n  - Focus's \\(y\\)-coordinate is 3\n  - Axis of symmetry is parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis\n  - Vertex lies on the \\(y\\)-axis\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of parabolas that open horizontally since the axis of symmetry is parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis. I know that parabolas can have different orientations, and their standard forms vary accordingly. But honestly, I'm a bit unsure how to start. Maybe exploring different strategies could help.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Use the Standard Equation of a Parabola**\n\nI recall that for parabolas with axes parallel to the coordinate axes, we have standard forms:\n\n- For a parabola opening left or right: \\((y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)\\)\n- For a parabola opening up or down: \\((x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)\\)\n\nGiven that the axis of symmetry is parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis, it seems like the first form fits. But wait, the vertex is on the \\(y\\)-axis, so \\(h = 0\\). This simplifies our equation.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If the vertex is on the \\(y\\)-axis, then \\(h = 0\\).\n- So, our equation becomes: \\((y - k)^2 = 4p(x)\\).\n\nBut before diving deeper, let's see if this approach aligns with all given properties.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Focus's \\(y\\)-coordinate is 3:** In the standard form, the focus is at \\((h + p, k)\\). Since \\(h = 0\\) and the focus's \\(y\\)-coordinate is 3, this implies \\(k = 3\\).\n- **Vertex lies on the \\(y\\)-axis:** This is already accounted for by setting \\(h = 0\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Setting \\(k = 3\\) places the vertex at \\((0, 3)\\). The equation now is:\n\n\\[\n(y - 3)^2 = 4p(x)\n\\]\n\nThis seems to align with the properties. Let's proceed with this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Determine \\(p\\) Using the Given Point**\n\nWe know the parabola passes through \\((1,5)\\). Let's plug this point into our equation to find \\(p\\).\n\n\\[\n(5 - 3)^2 = 4p(1) \\\\\n4 = 4p \\\\\np = 1\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so \\(p = 1\\). This indicates that the parabola opens to the right since \\(p\\) is positive. Seems straightforward so far.\n\n**Quick Reflection:**\n\nDoes \\(p = 1\\) make sense? With \\(p = 1\\), the focus is at \\((1, 3)\\), which matches the given focus's \\(y\\)-coordinate. Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Write the Equation in Standard Form**\n\nNow that we have \\(p = 1\\), let's write the equation:\n\n\\[\n(y - 3)^2 = 4(x)\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThis is the standard form, but the problem asks for the equation in a specific general form. We'll need to rearrange it accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 2: Convert to the General Conic Form**\n\nThe desired form is:\n\n\\[\nax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f = 0\n\\]\n\nGiven our equation, it seems like we'll need to expand and rearrange terms to fit this format.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Expand \\((y - 3)^2\\).\n2. Move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero.\n3. Identify coefficients \\(a, b, c, d, e, f\\).\n\nLet's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Expand and Rearrange the Equation**\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[\n(y - 3)^2 = 4x\n\\]\n\nExpand \\((y - 3)^2\\):\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 6y + 9 = 4x\n\\]\n\nMove all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 6y + 9 - 4x = 0\n\\]\n\nRearrange to match the general form:\n\n\\[\n-4x + y^2 - 6y + 9 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThis looks better. Now, let's match it to the general form.\n\n**Strategy Reflection:**\n\nIs there a better way to ensure all coefficients are integers and satisfy the gcd condition? Maybe factoring or adjusting coefficients could help.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Assign Coefficients**\n\nComparing:\n\n\\[\n-4x + y^2 - 6y + 9 = 0\n\\]\n\nWith the general form:\n\n\\[\nax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f = 0\n\\]\n\nWe can see:\n\n- \\(a = 0\\) (no \\(x^2\\) term)\n- \\(b = 0\\) (no \\(xy\\) term)\n- \\(c = 1\\) (coefficient of \\(y^2\\))\n- \\(d = -4\\) (coefficient of \\(x\\))\n- \\(e = -6\\) (coefficient of \\(y\\))\n- \\(f = 9\\) (constant term)\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes this satisfy \\( \\gcd(|a|, |b|, |c|, |d|, |e|, |f|) = 1 \\)?\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(0, 0, 1, 4, 6, 9) = 1\n\\]\n\nEverything seems to fit. The greatest common divisor is 1, which satisfies the condition.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nIs there anything missing? Have all the properties been accounted for?\n\n- **Passes through \\((1,5)\\):** Yes, we used this to find \\(p\\).\n- **Focus's \\(y\\)-coordinate is 3:** The focus is at \\((1, 3)\\), which matches.\n- **Axis of symmetry parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis:** The equation reflects this.\n- **Vertex lies on the \\(y\\)-axis:** The vertex is at \\((0, 3)\\).\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution - Final Answer**\n\nThe equation of the parabola is:\n\n\\[\n0x^2 + 0xy + y^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0\n\\]\n\nOr simply:\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 0, \\\\\nb &= 0, \\\\\nc &= 1, \\\\\nd &= -4, \\\\\ne &= -6, \\\\\nf &= 9.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAll conditions are satisfied, and the greatest common divisor of the absolute values of the coefficients is 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Wrapping Up**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and checking for correctness, we've successfully derived the equation of the parabola that meets all the given properties.",
  "ground_truth": "Since the axis of symmetry is parallel to the $x$-axis, and the $y$-coordinate of the focus is 3, the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is also 3.
