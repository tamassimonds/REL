  "solution": "### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. We need to find the domain of the function:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{x+6}{\\sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 4}}\n\\]\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Hmm...** This looks like a rational function with a square root in the denominator.\n- **Wait a minute...** I remember that for the denominator to be valid, the expression inside the square root must be positive.\n- **Actually, maybe I need to...** Ensure that \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \\) to avoid division by zero and keep the square root real.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Analyze the Denominator:** Make sure \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \\).\n2. **Find Critical Points:** Solve \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \\) to identify boundary points.\n3. **Test Intervals:** Check where the inequality holds by testing intervals around the critical points.\n\n**But wait...** Is this the best approach? Let's see if it works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing the Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Okay, so...** To keep the denominator real and non-zero, we need \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \\).\n- **Let me think...** This means solving the inequality to find the valid \\( x \\) values.\n\n**Reflection:** Does this make sense? Yes, because if the denominator is zero or negative, the function becomes undefined.\n\n**Proceeding:** Let's find where \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \\) to identify critical points.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding Critical Points**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Alright, I need to...** Solve \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \\) to find the roots.\n- **This reminds me of...** Using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -3 \\), and \\( c = -4 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4(1)(-4) = 9 + 16 = 25\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm 5}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx_1 = \\frac{8}{2} = 4,\\quad x_2 = \\frac{-2}{2} = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, the critical points are \\( x = 4 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\). These are where the denominator becomes zero.\n\n**Wait, let me check...** Does this make sense? Yes, at \\( x = 4 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\), the denominator is zero, making the function undefined.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Testing Intervals**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Hmm, now I need to...** Determine where \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \\) by testing intervals around the critical points.\n- **The intervals are...**  \n  1. \\( x < -1 \\)  \n  2. \\( -1 < x < 4 \\)  \n  3. \\( x > 4 \\)\n\n**But wait...** Is there a better way to test these intervals? Maybe using test points within each interval to see if the inequality holds.\n\n**Proceeding:** Let's pick test points and evaluate the inequality.\n\n---\n\n**Test Points:**\n\n1. **Interval \\( x < -1 \\):** Let's pick \\( x = -2 \\)\n\n\\[\n(-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0\n\\]\n\n**So, \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \\) in this interval.**\n\n2. **Interval \\( -1 < x < 4 \\):** Let's pick \\( x = 0 \\)\n\n\\[\n0^2 - 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0\n\\]\n\n**So, \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 < 0 \\) in this interval.**\n\n3. **Interval \\( x > 4 \\):** Let's pick \\( x = 5 \\)\n\n\\[\n5^2 - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0\n\\]\n\n**So, \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \\) in this interval.**\n\n**Reflection:** Based on the test points, the inequality holds for \\( x < -1 \\) and \\( x > 4 \\).\n\n**Wait, does this mean...** The domain is all \\( x \\) less than -1 and greater than 4? Exactly!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Writing the Domain**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Alright, let's see...** The function is defined where \\( x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0 \\), which is in the intervals \\( x < -1 \\) and \\( x > 4 \\).\n- **So the domain is...**\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -1) \\cup (4, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n**But wait, let me double-check...** Does this make sense? Yes, because at \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\), the denominator is zero, making the function undefined. Between \\( -1 \\) and \\( 4 \\), the denominator is negative, which also makes the square root undefined in the real number system.\n\n**Final Reflection:** Everything checks out. The domain excludes the intervals where the denominator is zero or negative.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\nThe domain of the function is \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\cup (4, \\infty) \\).\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Phew, that was straightforward!** By analyzing the denominator and testing intervals, I determined the domain.\n- **Learning Moment:** Always verify by checking test points and ensure that the denominator is positive to keep the function defined.\n- **Actually, this approach worked well...** No need to change strategies once I started testing intervals.\n\n**Wait, what if I...** Hadn't tested the intervals? I might have missed identifying where the function is undefined, so it's crucial to test!\n\n**Overall Reflection:** Taking it step by step, checking each part of the process, and verifying with test points ensured that the solution is correct.",
  "ground_truth": "The function is defined when the value inside the square root is positive, i.e. we must have $x^2-3x-4>0$. Factoring, we get $(x-4)(x+1)>0$. So either both factors in the left hand side are negative or they are both positive. They are both negative when $x<-1$. They are both positive when $x>4$. So the domain of $f(x)$ is $x<-1 \\text{ or } x>4$, or $x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty, -1) \\cup (4, \\infty)}$ in interval notation."
