  "problem": "Let $P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$. For how many polynomials $Q(x)$ does there exist a polynomial $R(x)$ of degree 3 such that $P\\left(Q(x)\\right) = P(x)\\cdot R(x)$?",
  "solution": "# Solution: Counting Valid Quadratic Polynomials \\( Q(x) \\)\n\nAlright, let's dive back into this problem and refine our approach to ensure we're capturing all the nuances. We need to find the number of quadratic polynomials \\( Q(x) \\) such that there exists a cubic polynomial \\( R(x) \\) satisfying:\n\n\\[\nP(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3) \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:** Initially, I considered only six straightforward permutations for \\( Q(x) \\), but reflecting on that, I realize it might be too simplistic. Perhaps there are more possibilities depending on how \\( Q(x) \\) maps specific points. I need to explore this further to ensure accuracy.\n\n## **Step 1: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nTo tackle this problem effectively, let's brainstorm different strategies:\n\n1. **Degree Considerations:** Check the degrees of both sides to constrain \\( Q(x) \\).\n2. **Analyzing Roots:** Since \\( P(x) \\) has roots at 1, 2, and 3, see how \\( Q(x) \\) affects these roots.\n3. **Ordered Triples Approach:** Consider how \\( Q(x) \\) maps specific points and count the valid combinations.\n\n**Decision:** Starting with **Degree Considerations** is still a good idea to ensure both sides of the equation align. From there, delving into the **Ordered Triples Approach** will help account for all possible \\( Q(x) \\).\n\n## **Step 2: Degree Considerations**\n\nLet's determine the degrees involved to ensure both sides of the equation match.\n\n- \\( P(x) \\) is cubic (\\( \\deg P(x) = 3 \\)).\n- \\( R(x) \\) is cubic (\\( \\deg R(x) = 3 \\)).\n- Therefore, \\( P(x) \\cdot R(x) \\) is degree 6.\n\nOn the left side, \\( P(Q(x)) \\) will have a degree of \\( 3 \\times \\deg Q(x) \\). To match the right side's degree of 6, \\( \\deg Q(x) \\) must be 2.\n\n\\[\n\\deg P(Q(x)) = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This confirms that \\( Q(x) \\) must be a quadratic polynomial. Okay, that part was correct.\n\n## **Step 3: Analyzing Roots**\n\nGiven that \\( P(x) \\) has roots at 1, 2, and 3, the equation \\( P(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x) \\) implies that:\n\n\\[\nP(Q(x)) = 0 \\quad \\text{where} \\quad P(x) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, for \\( x = 1, 2, 3 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\nP(Q(1)) = 0, \\quad P(Q(2)) = 0, \\quad P(Q(3)) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis means \\( Q(1), Q(2), \\) and \\( Q(3) \\) must each be 1, 2, or 3.\n\n**Initial Insight:** Originally, I considered only six permutations, but now I see that each \\( Q(i) \\) can independently be any of 1, 2, or 3. This leads to more combinations.\n\n**Reflection:** Wait a minute, I think I see where I went wrong. I only accounted for a limited set of permutations, but in reality, there are many more ways to assign values to \\( Q(1), Q(2), \\) and \\( Q(3) \\).\n\n## **Step 4: Ordered Triples Approach**\n\nWe need to find all ordered triples \\( (Q(1), Q(2), Q(3)) \\) where each \\( Q(i) \\) is 1, 2, or 3. There are \\( 3^3 = 27 \\) total ordered triples.\n\nHowever, some of these triples correspond to \\( Q(x) \\) being a constant or linear polynomial, which wouldn't satisfy the degree requirement for \\( Q(x) \\) being quadratic.\n\n**Thought Process:** To ensure \\( Q(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial, we must exclude cases where all \\( Q(i) \\) are the same (constant polynomials) or where \\( Q(x) \\) is linear.\n\n## **Step 5: Identifying Valid Triples**\n\nOut of the 27 ordered triples, the following cases lead to \\( Q(x) \\) being constant or linear:\n\n1. **Constant Polynomials:** \n   - \\( (1, 1, 1) \\): \\( Q(x) = 1 \\)\n   - \\( (2, 2, 2) \\): \\( Q(x) = 2 \\)\n   - \\( (3, 3, 3) \\): \\( Q(x) = 3 \\)\n\n2. **Linear Polynomials:** \n   - \\( (1, 2, 3) \\): \\( Q(x) = x \\)\n   - \\( (3, 2, 1) \\): \\( Q(x) = 4 - x \\)\n\n**Total Invalid Cases:** 5\n\n**Valid Quadratic Cases:** \\( 27 - 5 = 22 \\)\n\n**Reflection:** By excluding these 5 cases, we're left with 22 ordered triples that lead to \\( Q(x) \\) being a quadratic polynomial. This seems more accurate.\n\n## **Step 6: Verifying the Approach**\n\nEach of the remaining 22 ordered triples corresponds to a unique quadratic \\( Q(x) \\) because they represent non-collinear points, ensuring \\( Q(x) \\) is genuinely quadratic.\n\n**Final Check:** Does assigning different combinations of 1, 2, and 3 to \\( Q(1), Q(2), Q(3) \\) ensure that \\( P(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x) \\)? Yes, because \\( P(Q(x)) \\) will have roots at the points where \\( Q(x) \\) equals 1, 2, or 3, matching the roots of \\( P(x) \\).\n\n**Conclusion:** This reasoning aligns with the original equation, confirming that there are indeed 22 valid quadratic polynomials \\( Q(x) \\).\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>There are 22 polynomials \\( Q(x) \\) that satisfy the given condition.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\nBy reconsidering the number of valid ordered triples \\( (Q(1), Q(2), Q(3)) \\) and excluding cases where \\( Q(x) \\) is not quadratic, we arrive at the correct number of polynomials \\( Q(x) \\) that satisfy the equation \\( P(Q(x)) = P(x) \\cdot R(x) \\). Initially, I underestimated the count by only considering basic permutations, but a more thorough analysis revealed the correct total.\n\n**Final Reflection:** This step-by-step approach ensures that all possibilities are accounted for, leading to an accurate and complete solution.",
  "ground_truth": "The polynomial $P(x)\\cdot R(x)$ has degree 6, so $Q(x)$ must have degree 2. Therefore $Q$ is uniquely determined by the ordered triple $(Q(1), Q(2),Q(3))$.  When $x = 1$, 2, or 3, we have\n\\[0 = P(x)\\cdot R(x) = P\\left(Q(x)\\right).\\]It follows that $(Q(1), Q(2), Q(3))$ is one of the 27 ordered triples $(i, j, k)$, where $i$, $j$, and $k$ can be chosen from the set $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nHowever, the choices $(1, 1, 1)$, $(2, 2, 2)$, $(3, 3, 3)$, $(1, 2, 3)$, and $(3, 2, 1)$ lead to polynomials $Q(x)$ defined by $Q(x) = 1$, $2,$ $3,$ $x,$ and $4-x$, respectively, all of which have degree less than 2. The other $\\boxed{22}$ choices for $(Q(1),Q(2),Q(3))$ yield non-collinear points, so in each case $Q(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial."
