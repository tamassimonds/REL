  "problem": "Susie Q has 1000 dollars to invest.  She invests some of the money at the Pretty Penny Bank, which compounds annually at 3 percent.  She invests the rest of the money at the Five and Dime Bank, which compounds annually at 5 percent.  After two years, Susie has a total of $\\$1090.02$.  How much did Susie Q originally invest at the Pretty Penny Bank, in dollars?",
  "solution": "---\n\n### **1. First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n---\n\n**Alright, let me see what we have here.**\n\n- Susie Q has $1,000 to invest.\n  - **Initial Thought:** Okay, she has a fixed amount to start with.\n\n- She invests some at the Pretty Penny Bank (PPB) with 3% annual compounding.\n  - **Reflection:** So, part of her money grows at 3% per year.\n\n- The rest is invested at the Five and Dime Bank (FDB) with 5% annual compounding.\n  - **Thought:** The remaining amount grows at a higher rate of 5% per year.\n\n- After two years, her total is $1,090.02.\n  - **Initial Brainstorm:** Hmm, the total includes both investments after compounding for two years.\n\n- **Question:** How much did she originally invest at the Pretty Penny Bank?\n  - **Gut Reaction:** Feels like I need to figure out how much was invested at each bank to total $1,090.02 after two years.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n---\n\n**Let me think about how to approach this.**\n\n- **First Idea:** Maybe set up equations based on compound interest for both banks.\n  \n  - **Thought Process:** I know compound interest formulas can help calculate the amount after a certain period. But wait, do I remember the formula correctly?\n\n- **Second Idea:** Perhaps use a system of equations since there are two unknowns (amounts invested in each bank).\n  \n  - **Reflection:** Yeah, that makes sense. Two investments, two equations.\n\n- **Third Idea:** Maybe guess and check with different amounts to see what fits.\n  \n  - **Reality Check:** That might take too long and isn\u2019t precise. Better to stick with equations.\n\n**Decision:** I\u2019ll start with setting up equations based on compound interest. If that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Setting Up the Equations**\n\n---\n\n**Alright, let's try setting up equations.**\n\n- **Given:**\n  - Total investment: $1,000\n  - Total after two years: $1,090.02\n  - PPB compounding at 3%\n  - FDB compounding at 5%\n\n- **Let\u2019s Define Variables:**\n  - Let \\( x \\) be the amount invested at the Pretty Penny Bank.\n  - Therefore, \\( 1,000 - x \\) is invested at the Five and Dime Bank.\n  \n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  x &= \\text{amount invested at PPB} \\\\\n  1,000 - x &= \\text{amount invested at FDB}\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Thought Check:** Does this make sense? Yeah, since the total investment is $1,000, whatever isn\u2019t invested in PPB is in FDB.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Writing the Compound Interest Formulas**\n\n---\n\n**Now, let\u2019s write the compound interest formulas for both investments.**\n\n- **Pretty Penny Bank (PPB):**\n  - Compounded annually at 3% for two years.\n  - **Formula:** \\( A = P (1 + r)^t \\)\n  \n    \\[\n    A_{\\text{PPB}} = x (1 + 0.03)^2\n    \\]\n    \n    \\[\n    A_{\\text{PPB}} = x \\times 1.0609\n    \\]\n    \n    - **Thought:** Okay, so after two years, the amount at PPB is \\( x \\) multiplied by 1.0609.\n\n- **Five and Dime Bank (FDB):**\n  - Compounded annually at 5% for two years.\n  \n    \\[\n    A_{\\text{FDB}} = (1,000 - x) (1 + 0.05)^2\n    \\]\n    \n    \\[\n    A_{\\text{FDB}} = (1,000 - x) \\times 1.1025\n    \\]\n    \n    - **Reflection:** That looks right. Each investment grows by its respective compounding factor after two years.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Creating the Total Equation**\n\n---\n\n**Okay, so the total amount after two years is the sum of both investments.**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nA_{\\text{PPB}} + A_{\\text{FDB}} &= 1,090.02 \\\\\nx \\times 1.0609 + (1,000 - x) \\times 1.1025 &= 1,090.02\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n- **Thought Process:** This equation represents the total amount after two years. Each part contributes to the final total.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Simplifying the Equation**\n\n---\n\n**Let\u2019s simplify the equation to make it easier to solve for \\( x \\).**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1.0609x + 1,102.5 - 1.1025x &= 1,090.02\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** Oh, I need to combine like terms.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(1.0609 - 1.1025)x + 1,102.5 &= 1,090.02 \\\\\n-0.0416x + 1,102.5 &= 1,090.02\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n- **Thought Check:** Subtracting the coefficients of \\( x \\) makes sense here. Looks good so far.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Solving for \\( x \\)**\n\n---\n\n**Now, let\u2019s isolate \\( x \\) to find the amount invested at PPB.**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n-0.0416x &= 1,090.02 - 1,102.5 \\\\\n-0.0416x &= -12.48\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Hmm, both sides are negative, so dividing by \\(-0.0416\\) should give a positive \\( x \\).\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-12.48}{-0.0416} = 300\n\\]\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does this value make sense? Let me think... If \\( x \\) is $300, then $700 is invested at FDB. Seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Verifying the Solution**\n\n---\n\n**Let\u2019s double-check to ensure this solution is correct.**\n\n- **Calculate Amounts After Two Years:**\n  \n  - **PPB:**\n    \n    \\[\n    A_{\\text{PPB}} = 300 \\times 1.0609 = 318.27\n    \\]\n  \n    - **Thought:** So, $300 grows to $318.27 at PPB.\n\n  - **FDB:**\n    \n    \\[\n    A_{\\text{FDB}} = 700 \\times 1.1025 = 771.75\n    \\]\n  \n    - **Reflection:** And $700 grows to $771.75 at FDB.\n\n- **Total Amount:**\n  \n  \\[\n  318.27 + 771.75 = 1,090.02\n  \\]\n  \n  - **Check:** Perfect! The total matches the given amount after two years.\n\n- **Final Thought:** The calculations hold up, so the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **9. Conclusion**\n\n---\n\n**Alright, after working through the problem step by step and verifying the solution, I conclude that Susie Q originally invested $300 at the Pretty Penny Bank.**\n\n<ANSWER> Susie Q originally invested **$300** at the Pretty Penny Bank. </ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n---\n\n**Thinking back on the process:**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Starting with different strategies helped ensure I took the right approach. Even though the first idea worked, considering alternatives was valuable.\n\n- **Equation Setup:** Defining variables and writing compound interest formulas made the problem more manageable.\n\n- **Simplification and Solving:** Carefully simplifying the equation and solving for \\( x \\) led to the correct answer.\n\n- **Verification:** Double-checking the solution reinforced its correctness and added confidence to the final answer.\n\n**Overall, taking a methodical approach with regular checks along the way ensured an accurate and reliable solution.**\n\n---\n\nI hope this helps!

  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of dollars Susie Q invested at the Pretty Penny Bank.  Then she invested $1000 - x$ at the Five and Dime Bank.  After two years, her account at the Pretty Penny Bank has grown to $x \\cdot 1.03^2$, and her account at the Five and Dime Bank has grown to $(1000 - x) \\cdot 1.05^2$.  Therefore, \\[x \\cdot 1.03^2 + (1000 - x) \\cdot 1.05^2 = 1090.02.\\]We see that $x \\cdot 1.03^2 + (1000 - x) \\cdot 1.05^2 = 1.0609x + 1102.5 - 1.1025x = 1102.5 - 0.0416x$, so \\[1102.5 - 0.0416x = 1090.02.\\]Then \\[x = \\frac{1102.5 - 1090.02}{0.0416} = \\boxed{300}.\\]"
