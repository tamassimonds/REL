  "solution": "Absolutely, let\u2019s dive into this problem again, keeping the effective parts of the initial approach while refining and correcting where necessary. I'll maintain a natural, reflective thought process throughout\u2014just like tackling it step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n- **Initial Impression:**  \n  We need to find the probability that a randomly selected number from 1 to 150 is *not* a perfect power. Perfect powers are numbers that can be expressed as \\( x^y \\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers, and \\( y \\geq 2 \\).\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**  \n  1. **List All Perfect Powers:** Count them and subtract from the total.\n  2. **Use Complement Probability:** Calculate the probability of picking a perfect power and subtract from 1.\n  3. **Explore Patterns or Formulas:** Look for mathematical shortcuts to identify perfect powers.\n\n- **Leaning Towards Strategy 1:**  \n  Listing perfect powers seems straightforward. Let's start there and see if it works, but remain open to adjusting the approach if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Listing Perfect Powers from 1 to 150**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Identify all numbers \\( x \\) and exponents \\( y \\) such that \\( x^y \\leq 150 \\) with \\( y \\geq 2 \\). This includes perfect squares, cubes, and higher powers.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Listing them manually might lead to missing some or double-counting. I need to be careful and ensure no overlaps are overlooked.\n\n#### **Perfect Squares (\\( y = 2 \\))**\n\n- \\( 1^2 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n- ...\n- Up to \\( 12^2 = 144 \\) (since \\( 13^2 = 169 > 150 \\))\n\n- **Total Perfect Squares:** 12\n\n#### **Perfect Cubes (\\( y = 3 \\))**\n\n- \\( 1^3 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 2^3 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 3^3 = 27 \\)\n- \\( 4^3 = 64 \\)\n- \\( 5^3 = 125 \\)\n- \\( 6^3 = 216 \\) (beyond 150)\n\n- **Total Perfect Cubes:** 5\n\n#### **Higher Powers**\n\n- **Perfect Fourth Powers (\\( y = 4 \\)):**\n  - \\( 2^4 = 16 \\)\n  - \\( 3^4 = 81 \\)\n  - \\( 4^4 = 256 \\) (beyond 150)\n\n- **Perfect Fifth Powers (\\( y = 5 \\)):**\n  - \\( 2^5 = 32 \\)\n  - \\( 3^5 = 243 \\) (beyond 150)\n\n- **Perfect Sixth Powers (\\( y = 6 \\)):**\n  - \\( 2^6 = 64 \\) (already counted as a square and cube)\n\n- **Perfect Seventh Powers (\\( y = 7 \\)):**\n  - \\( 2^7 = 128 \\) (unique)\n\n- **Observation:**  \n  Higher powers quickly exceed 150, so only lower exponents are relevant.\n\n- **Listing All Unique Perfect Powers:**\n  - Perfect Squares: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144]\n  - Perfect Cubes: [8, 27, 125]\n  - Perfect Fifth Power: [32]\n  - Perfect Seventh Power: [128]\n  \n- **Initial Total Unique Perfect Powers Counted:** 15\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Hmm, actually looking at this again, I might have missed some overlaps or additional perfect powers.\n\n---\n\n### **Realizing the Mistake: Missed Perfect Powers and Overlaps**\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Wait a minute, I think I see where I went wrong. I initially counted only 15 perfect powers, but I might have missed some higher powers or double-counted overlapping ones. Let's re-evaluate the list.\n\n- **Checking for Overlaps:**  \n  - \\( 1 \\) appears as \\( 1^2 \\) and \\( 1^3 \\), but should be counted once.\n  - \\( 64 \\) appears as both \\( 8^2 \\) and \\( 4^3 \\), so I need to account for duplicates.\n\n- **Realizing Missing Perfect Powers:**  \n  - **Perfect Sixth Powers (\\( y = 6 \\)):**\n    - \\( 2^6 = 64 \\) (already counted as a perfect square and cube)\n  - **Higher Powers Beyond Fifth:**  \n    - \\( 2^7 = 128 \\) (not previously listed)\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  I missed counting \\( 2^7 = 128 \\) and need to adjust for duplicates like \\( 64 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Correcting the List of Perfect Powers**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  To avoid double-counting and missing perfect powers, let\u2019s systematically list them and adjust for overlaps.\n\n#### **Listing All Relevant Perfect Powers**\n\n- **Perfect Squares (\\( y = 2 \\)):**  \n  [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144]  \n  **Total:** 12\n\n- **Perfect Cubes (\\( y = 3 \\)):**  \n  [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]  \n  **Total:** 5\n\n- **Perfect Fourth Powers (\\( y = 4 \\)):**  \n  [16, 81] (already counted as perfect squares)\n\n- **Perfect Fifth Powers (\\( y = 5 \\)):**  \n  [32] (unique)\n\n- **Perfect Sixth Powers (\\( y = 6 \\)):**  \n  [64] (already counted as both a square and a cube)\n\n- **Perfect Seventh Powers (\\( y = 7 \\)):**  \n  [128] (unique)\n\n#### **Accounting for Duplicates**\n\n- **Duplicates Identified:**  \n  - \\( 1 \\) is counted in both squares and cubes.\n  - \\( 64 \\) is counted in squares and cubes.\n\n- **Adjusting Total Count:**  \n  - **Initial Count:** 12 (squares) + 5 (cubes) + 1 (fifth) + 1 (seventh) = 19  \n  - **Subtracting Duplicates:** 19 - 2 (for \\( 1 \\) and \\( 64 \\)) = 17\n\n- **Total Unique Perfect Powers:** 17\n\n- **Correct List of Perfect Powers:**  \n  [1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 125, 128, 144]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Now, this list seems more accurate. I initially undercounted by missing some higher perfect powers and not properly accounting for duplicates.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Probability**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  With the corrected count of perfect powers, let's calculate the probability again.\n\n- **Total Numbers in the Range:** 150\n\n- **Numbers That Are Not Perfect Powers:**  \n  \\[\n  150 - 17 = 133\n  \\]\n\n- **Probability Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Probability} = \\frac{133}{150} = \\frac{133}{150}\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Reducing \\( \\frac{133}{150} \\) doesn't simplify further, so this remains our final probability.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This seems correct now. By properly accounting for all perfect powers and adjusting for duplicates, the probability aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Before finalizing, let\u2019s ensure that no perfect powers were missed and that duplicates are handled correctly.\n\n- **Re-examining the List:**  \n  - **Perfect Squares:** 12 numbers\n  - **Perfect Cubes:** 5 numbers (including duplicates)\n  - **Higher Powers:** Additional unique perfect powers like \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 2^7 = 128 \\)\n\n- **Checking for Duplicates:**  \n  - \\( 1 \\) and \\( 64 \\) are counted more than once, so subtracting those duplicates is essential.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy Check:**  \n  Initially, listing seemed straightforward, but without careful accounting, it led to errors. Being meticulous about overlaps is crucial.\n\n- **Final Check:**  \n  Does the probability \\( \\frac{133}{150} \\) make sense? Yes, it represents the fraction of numbers that are not perfect powers after correctly identifying all perfect powers up to 150.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{133}{150}}\n\\]\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected number from 1 to 150 is not a perfect power is \\(\\frac{133}{150}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **Summary of the Corrected Approach:**  \n  - Initially, I undercounted perfect powers by missing higher powers and not properly accounting for duplicates.\n  - By carefully listing all relevant perfect powers and adjusting for overlaps, the total count of perfect powers is 17.\n  - Subtracting these from the total numbers gives 133 numbers that are not perfect powers, resulting in a probability of \\(\\frac{133}{150}\\).\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  - **Initial Mistake:** Only counted 15 perfect powers and missed higher powers like \\( 2^7 = 128 \\).\n  - **Correction:** Re-evaluated the list, accounted for duplicates, and included all relevant perfect powers up to 150.\n  - **Final Outcome:** A more accurate probability reflecting the true count of non-perfect power numbers.\n\n- **Final Thoughts:**  \n  - **Verification:** Always double-check for overlaps and ensure all relevant cases are considered, especially with higher exponents.\n  - **Approach Validity:** Listing works well for smaller ranges, but care must be taken to avoid missing or double-counting numbers.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if there's anything else you'd like me to explore or if you have any other questions!",
  "ground_truth": "It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect powers. We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \\ldots, 5^{3}$. Notice all the perfect fourth powers are also perfect squares. Similarly, all the perfect sixth powers are also perfect squares. The only perfect powers not yet counted are $2^5=32$ and $2^7=128$. Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1$ and $2^{6} = 64$ which we counted both as perfect squares and perfect cubes. So there is a total $12+5+1+1-2=17$ of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect powers. Thus, $150-17=133$ integers are not perfect powers. The probability that we select such a number is $\\boxed{\\frac{133}{150}}$."
