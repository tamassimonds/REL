  "solution": "Certainly! Let's put this all together into a coherent and complete solution, ensuring clarity and logical flow throughout. We'll maintain the original answer while refining the narrative to present it as a structured problem-solving process.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( d \\) for a 4-digit integer in base 8 when represented in base 2.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Involves number bases and digit lengths.\n- Converting numbers between different bases seems essential.\n- Need to determine how digit lengths vary when transitioning from base 8 to base 2.\n\n**Initial Strategy:**\n\n1. **Determine the Range of 4-Digit Numbers in Base 8:**\n   - Identify the smallest and largest 4-digit numbers.\n   \n2. **Convert These Numbers to Base 10:**\n   - This helps in understanding their actual numeric values.\n   \n3. **Translate the Decimal Range to Base 2:**\n   - Find out the digit lengths in base 2 to determine all possible \\( d \\) values.\n   \n4. **Sum Up All Possible \\( d \\) Values:**\n   - Compute the total of all distinct digit lengths obtained.\n\n### **Step 1: Determining the Range in Base 8**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- A 4-digit number in base 8 has digits ranging from 0 to 7.\n- **Smallest Number:** Begins with 1 (to ensure it's 4 digits), followed by zeros.\n- **Largest Number:** All digits are 7.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Smallest Number:** \\( 1000_8 \\)\n- **Largest Number:** \\( 7777_8 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Confirmed that \\( 1000_8 \\) is indeed the smallest 4-digit number since leading zeros would reduce the digit count.\n\n### **Step 2: Converting Base 8 Numbers to Decimal**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Converting to decimal (base 10) provides the actual numeric range.\n- This step is crucial for accurately transitioning to base 2.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Smallest Number:**\n   \\[\n   1000_8 = 1 \\times 8^3 + 0 \\times 8^2 + 0 \\times 8^1 + 0 \\times 8^0 = 512_{10}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Largest Number:**\n   \\[\n   7777_8 = 7 \\times 8^3 + 7 \\times 8^2 + 7 \\times 8^1 + 7 \\times 8^0 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 3584 + 448 + 56 + 7 = 4095_{10}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The decimal range is from 512 to 4095.\n- This range will help in determining the digit lengths in base 2.\n\n### **Step 3: Converting Decimal Range to Base 2**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Need to find out how many digits these numbers occupy in base 2.\n- This will reveal all possible values of \\( d \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Smallest Number (512) in Base 2:**\n   \\[\n   512_{10} = 2^9 = 1000000000_2 \\quad (\\text{10 digits})\n   \\]\n\n2. **Largest Number (4095) in Base 2:**\n   \\[\n   4095_{10} = 2^{12} - 1 = 111111111111_2 \\quad (\\text{12 digits})\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The digit lengths range from 10 to 12.\n- Thus, \\( d \\) can be 10, 11, or 12.\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying All Possible Values of \\( d \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Each digit length corresponds to a specific range of numbers in base 2.\n- Need to categorize the decimal numbers based on their binary digit lengths.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **\\( d = 10 \\):**\n  \\[\n  2^9 = 512 \\quad \\text{to} \\quad 2^{10} - 1 = 1023\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\( d = 11 \\):**\n  \\[\n  2^{10} = 1024 \\quad \\text{to} \\quad 2^{11} - 1 = 2047\n  \\]\n  \n- **\\( d = 12 \\):**\n  \\[\n  2^{11} = 2048 \\quad \\text{to} \\quad 2^{12} - 1 = 4095\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- All numbers from 512 to 4095 fit into binary representations with 10 to 12 digits.\n- Therefore, \\( d \\) has three possible values: 10, 11, and 12.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Sum of All Possible \\( d \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Simply add the possible digit lengths to find the required sum.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n10 + 11 + 12 = 33\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The sum of all possible \\( d \\) values is straightforward.\n- No additional complexities or hidden factors.\n\n### **Step 6: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**<ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{33}\n\\]\n\n**</ANSWER>**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- After thorough verification, the sum of all possible values of \\( d \\) is **33**.\n- Each step logically leads to this conclusion without any discrepancies.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically:\n\n1. **Determining the Range in Base 8:**\n   - Identifying \\( 1000_8 \\) to \\( 7777_8 \\).\n   \n2. **Converting to Decimal:**\n   - Translating to 512 to 4095 in base 10.\n   \n3. **Converting to Base 2:**\n   - Observing digit lengths from 10 to 12.\n   \n4. **Summing Possible \\( d \\) Values:**\n   - Adding 10, 11, and 12 to obtain 33.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- All steps are logically consistent and coherent.\n- No assumptions were overlooked, and each calculation aligns with the intended outcome.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{33}\\)\n\n---\n\nBy organizing the solution this way, we've ensured a clear and methodical approach to solving the problem while maintaining the original answer.",
  "ground_truth": "The smallest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $1000_8$, which stands for $8^3 = 2^9$. The largest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $7777_8$, which is $1$ less than $10000_8$ and therefore stands for $8^4-1 = 2^{12}-1$.\n\nThus, when a $4$-digit base-$8$ integer is written in base $2$, its highest place value is either $2^9$, $2^{10}$, or $2^{11}$. It follows that the base-$2$ expression has $10$, $11$, or $12$ digits, so the sum of all possible values for $d$ is $10+11+12 = \\boxed{33}$."
