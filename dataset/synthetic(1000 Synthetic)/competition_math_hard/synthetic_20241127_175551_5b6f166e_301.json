  "problem": "At Central Middle School the $108$ students who take the AMC 8 meet in the evening to talk about problems and eat an average of two cookies apiece. Walter and Gretel are baking Bonnie's Best Bar Cookies this year. Their recipe, which makes a pan of $15$ cookies, lists these items:\n\n$\\bullet$ $1\\frac{1}{2}$ cups of flour\n\n$\\bullet$ $2$ eggs\n\n$\\bullet$ $3$ tablespoons butter\n\n$\\bullet$ $\\frac{3}{4}$ cups sugar\n\n$\\bullet$ $1$ package of chocolate drops\n\nThey will make only full recipes, no partial recipes.\n\nThey learn that a big concert is scheduled for the same night and attendance will be down $25\\%.$ How many recipes of cookies should they make for their smaller party?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's organize this into a cohesive solution while maintaining the original insights and final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Walter and Gretel's Cookie Dilemma: Crafting the Perfect Batch**\n\nWalter and Gretel are gearing up to bake cookies for an upcoming school event. However, with a concert drawing away some attendees, they need to adjust their plans accordingly. Let's walk through their thought process to determine how many cookie recipes they should prepare.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWalter and Gretel start by considering the key elements of the problem:\n\n- **Understanding the Demand:** They need to know how many students will attend the event despite the reduced attendance.\n- **Converting Demand to Recipes:** Once they have the total number of cookies required, they can calculate how many full recipes are necessary.\n- **Constraints:** Only full recipes can be baked\u2014no partial batches allowed.\n\nAt this point, they recall similar problems involving scaling quantities based on changing conditions. However, they realize that ingredient availability isn't mentioned, so they can focus solely on the number of recipes.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring a Range of Strategies**\n\nThey brainstorm the following steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Reduced Attendance:** Determine how many students will attend after accounting for a 25% reduction.\n2. **Determine Total Cookies Needed:** Calculate the total number of cookies based on each attending student eating an average of two cookies.\n3. **Convert Cookies to Recipes:** Figure out how many full recipes are needed, given that each recipe yields 15 cookies.\n\nThis approach seems straightforward, so they decide to proceed step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Reduced Attendance**\n\nFirst, Walter and Gretel need to determine the number of students attending after a 25% reduction.\n\n- **Original Number of Students:** 108\n- **Reduction Percentage:** 25%\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Number of Students Attending} = 108 \\times (1 - 0.25) \n\\]\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Number of Students Attending} = 108 \\times 0.75 = 81 \n\\]\n\n> **Thought:** Okay, so 81 students will attend. That makes sense\u201425% of 108 is 27, so subtracting 27 from 108 equals 81.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Check**\n\nThey double-check their calculation:\n\n- 25% of 108 is \\( 108 \\times 0.25 = 27 \\)\n- Subtracting that from 108: \\( 108 - 27 = 81 \\)\n\n> **Reflection:** Yep, that's correct. Moving on.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining Total Cookies Needed**\n\nNext, each of the 81 attending students will eat an average of two cookies.\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Cookies Needed} = 81 \\times 2 = 162 \n\\]\n\n> **Thought:** So, they need to bake 162 cookies in total. That seems like a manageable number.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Number of Recipes Required**\n\nNow, Walter and Gretel need to figure out how many full recipes are necessary to make at least 162 cookies. Each recipe yields 15 cookies.\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Number of Recipes} = \\frac{162}{15} = 10.8 \n\\]\n\n> **Reflection:** Wait a minute, 10.8 recipes don't make sense because they can only bake full recipes. They need to round up to ensure there are enough cookies.\n\n---\n\n### **Adjusting the Calculation: Rounding Up**\n\nSince partial recipes aren't possible, Walter and Gretel decide to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Number of Full Recipes Needed} = \\lceil 10.8 \\rceil = 11 \n\\]\n\n> **Thought:** By rounding up to 11 recipes, they'll ensure there are enough cookies for all students.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Check**\n\nThey verify if baking 11 recipes will meet the demand:\n\n\\[ \n11 \\times 15 = 165 \\text{ cookies} \n\\]\n\n> **Reflection:** Making 11 recipes yields 165 cookies, which is slightly more than the 162 needed. This is fine since it's better to have a few extra cookies than not enough.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Does This Approach Work?**\n\n- **Reduced Attendance Calculated Correctly:** Yes, 81 students.\n- **Total Cookies Needed Computed Accurately:** Yes, 162 cookies.\n- **Number of Recipes Rounded Appropriately:** Yes, rounded up to 11 to accommodate full recipes.\n\n> **Final Thought:** The approach works, and all calculations align with the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Walter and Gretel's Solution**\n\nWalter and Gretel should bake **11** full recipes of cookies to ensure there are enough for the reduced attendance at the event.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nInitially, they focused on calculating the reduced attendance and translating that into the number of cookies needed. Along the way, they realized that fractional recipes weren't feasible, prompting them to round up the number of recipes. By checking each step, they ensured the correctness of the solution. This methodical approach helped them arrive at the right answer efficiently.\n\n---\n\nAnd there we have it\u2014a complete and coherent solution that faithfully follows Walter and Gretel's original thought process, leading to the final answer of **11** full recipes.",
  "ground_truth": "The $108\\cdot 0.75=81$ students need $2$ cookies each so $162$ cookies are to be baked. Since $162\\div 15=10.8,$ Walter and Gretel must bake $\\boxed{11}$ recipes. A few leftovers are a good thing!"
