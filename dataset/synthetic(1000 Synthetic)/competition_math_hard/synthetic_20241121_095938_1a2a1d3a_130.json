  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, reflecting on our thinking process just like solving it on paper. We'll explore different strategies, check for correctness along the way, and ensure our final answer is accurate. Here's how it goes:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm... the question asks to write \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25} + \\frac{9}{4}}\\) as a common fraction. At first glance, this involves square roots and fractions. I recall dealing with square roots of sums before, but I'm not entirely sure of the best approach right now. Let's brainstorm some ideas.\n\n- **Initial Ideas:**\n  - **Simplify Fractions Individually:** Maybe take the square roots of \\(\\frac{16}{25}\\) and \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) separately?\n  - **Combine Fractions First:** Perhaps add the fractions into a single fraction before taking the square root?\n  - **Check Square Root Properties:** Does the square root distribute over addition? I need to double-check that.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Wait a minute, I remember that the square root doesn\u2019t distribute over addition (\\(\\sqrt{a + b} \\neq \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b}\\)). So, simplifying each fraction individually won't work. Combining the fractions first seems like a plausible strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\nLet's explore a few strategies to see which one makes the most sense.\n\n1. **Simplify Each Fraction Individually:**\n   - **Thought Process:** Take \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}}\\) separately.\n   - **But Wait...**  \n     Since the square root doesn\u2019t distribute over addition, this approach isn't valid.\n\n2. **Combine Fractions into a Single Fraction:**\n   - **Thought Process:** Adding the fractions inside the square root might simplify things.\n   - **Pro:**  \n     This way, I'll deal with a single fraction under the square root, which seems straightforward.\n\n3. **Approximate Values:**\n   - **Thought Process:** Calculate decimal equivalents to get an intuition.\n   - **Con:**  \n     Useful for verification but not suitable for an exact solution.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Combining the fractions into a single fraction before taking the square root appears to be the most straightforward and correct approach. Let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Combining the Fractions**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo add \\(\\frac{16}{25}\\) and \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\), I need a common denominator. The denominators are 25 and 4, so their least common multiple (LCM) is 100. Let's convert both fractions to have a denominator of 100.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Convert \\(\\frac{16}{25}\\):**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{16}{25} = \\frac{16 \\times 4}{25 \\times 4} = \\frac{64}{100}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Convert \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\):**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{9 \\times 25}{4 \\times 25} = \\frac{225}{100}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Adding the Fractions:**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{64}{100} + \\frac{225}{100} = \\frac{289}{100}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems correct. By converting both fractions to have the same denominator, I can easily add them together. The result is \\(\\frac{289}{100}\\), which looks neat.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Taking the Square Root**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to take the square root of \\(\\frac{289}{100}\\). I recall that the square root of a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}}\\), provided that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are non-negative. Let's apply this property.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{289}{100}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{289}}{\\sqrt{100}}\n\\]\n\n- **Calculating Square Roots:**  \n  - \\(\\sqrt{289} = 17\\) (since \\(17 \\times 17 = 289\\))\n  - \\(\\sqrt{100} = 10\\) (since \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\))\n  \n- **Result:**  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{\\frac{289}{100}} = \\frac{17}{10}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense. Both 289 and 100 are perfect squares, so their square roots are exact integers. The fraction \\(\\frac{17}{10}\\) is simplified and represents the exact value of the original expression. It feels like we're on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIt's always a good idea to verify the solution to ensure no mistakes were made along the way. I can do this by checking if squaring \\(\\frac{17}{10}\\) returns the original fraction inside the square root.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{17}{10}\\right)^2 = \\frac{17 \\times 17}{10 \\times 10} = \\frac{289}{100}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{289}{100} = \\frac{64}{100} + \\frac{225}{100} = \\frac{16}{25} + \\frac{9}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{64}{100} = \\frac{16}{25},\\quad \\frac{225}{100} = \\frac{9}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. Squaring \\(\\frac{17}{10}\\) reconstructs the original sum of fractions, confirming that the solution is correct. It's reassuring to see that the verification aligns perfectly with our initial calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Alternative Methods**\n\nEven though our primary method worked, let's think about whether there are other ways to approach the problem. Exploring different strategies can deepen understanding and provide backup options if the main method encounters issues.\n\n1. **Using Decimal Approximations:**\n   - **Thought Process:**  \n     Convert \\(\\frac{16}{25}\\) and \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) to decimals:\n     - \\(\\frac{16}{25} = 0.64\\)\n     - \\(\\frac{9}{4} = 2.25\\)\n     \n     Add them: \\(0.64 + 2.25 = 2.89\\)\n     \n     Take the square root: \\(\\sqrt{2.89} = 1.7\\)\n     \n     Convert back to a fraction: \\(1.7 = \\frac{17}{10}\\)\n     \n   - **Reflection:**  \n     This approach confirms the result but relies on decimal approximations, which might not be precise for more complex numbers. It's a good check but not ideal for exact solutions.\n\n2. **Factoring Inside the Square Root:**\n   - **Thought Process:**  \n     Recognize that \\(\\frac{289}{100}\\) is a perfect square fraction.\n     \n     Factor it as \\(\\left(\\frac{17}{10}\\right)^2\\).\n     \n     Take the square root directly:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{17}{10}\\right)^2} = \\frac{17}{10}\n     \\]\n     \n   - **Reflection:**  \n     This method aligns with the initial approach and reinforces the correctness of the solution. It also highlights the advantage of identifying perfect squares early on, making the process more efficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully working through the problem and verifying each step, we've determined that:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25} + \\frac{9}{4}} = \\frac{17}{10}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy combining fractions with a common denominator, applying the square root property, and verifying the solution through squaring, we've confidently arrived at the final answer: \\(\\frac{17}{10}\\). Along the way, exploring different strategies ensured the correctness and robustness of our approach. This thorough process not only confirms the accuracy of the solution but also enhances our understanding of handling similar mathematical problems.",
  "ground_truth": "To start, we need to find a common denominator and add the fractions under the square root.  Be careful to do this first, and not mix up this kind of expression with: $$\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}}$$ The two fractions have a common denominator of 100.  Combine them and simplify: $$\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}+\\frac{9}{4}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{64+225}{100}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{289}}{10}=\\boxed{\\frac{17}{10}}$$"
