  "solution": "Alright, let's organize this solution into a clear and cohesive write-up while maintaining the human-like thought process. We'll walk through the problem step by step, reflecting and checking our work along the way to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to find \\( g(3) \\) given the functions:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{3}{2-x}\n\\]\n\\[\ng(x) = \\frac{1}{f^{-1}(x)} + 9\n\\]\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Inverse Functions:** I notice that \\( g(x) \\) involves \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), the inverse of \\( f(x) \\). Handling inverses can be tricky, so I'll need to be careful.\n  \n- **Composing Functions:** It seems like \\( g(x) \\) is built by taking the inverse of \\( f \\), then reciprocating it and adding 9. Perhaps there's a way to simplify this expression.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:** I could try finding the inverse of \\( f(x) \\) first and then plug it into \\( g(x) ). Alternatively, looking for relationships between \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) might help without explicitly finding the inverse.\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\n\n- **Direct Approach:** Initially, I'm inclined to find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) directly. However, inverses can sometimes be messy, so it's worth exploring if there's a more straightforward method.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) Directly**\n\n- **Step 1:** Solve for \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) by setting \\( y = f(x) \\) and rearranging to solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\).\n\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{3}{2-x}\n  \\]\n\n  **Thought Process:** To find the inverse, I need to express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** This seems straightforward, so I'll proceed with this strategy.\n\n**Strategy 2: Look for Relationships Between \\( f \\) and \\( g \\)**\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Maybe I can find a direct relationship between \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) that simplifies the problem.\n\n  **Initial Reaction:** Not sure if this will work, but it's worth considering. It might avoid the need to find the inverse explicitly.\n\n**Strategy 3: Use Composition of Functions**\n\n- **Another Idea:** Perhaps expressing \\( g(x) \\) in terms of \\( f(x) \\) and its inverse could help simplify the expression.\n\n  **Quick Check:** This might complicate things further. Let's stick with the first strategy for now.\n\n**Decision:** I'll proceed with **Strategy 1**, as it appears to be the most straightforward path.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution Using Strategy 1**\n\n#### **Step 1: Find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\)**\n\n- **Set \\( y = f(x) \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{3}{2-x}\n  \\]\n\n- **Solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  y(2-x) = 3 \\implies 2 - x = \\frac{3}{y} \\implies x = 2 - \\frac{3}{y}\n  \\]\n\n- **Express \\( f^{-1}(x) \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  f^{-1}(x) = 2 - \\frac{3}{x}\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? If I plug \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) back into \\( f(x) \\), do I get \\( x \\)?\n\n  \\[\n  f(f^{-1}(x)) = f\\left(2 - \\frac{3}{x}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2 - \\left(2 - \\frac{3}{x}\\right)} = \\frac{3}{\\frac{3}{x}} = x\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Yes, it checks out. So, \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Substitute \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) into \\( g(x) \\)**\n\n- Given:\n\n  \\[\n  g(x) = \\frac{1}{f^{-1}(x)} + 9\n  \\]\n\n- Substitute \\( f^{-1}(x) \\):\n\n  \\[\n  g(x) = \\frac{1}{2 - \\frac{3}{x}} + 9\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Simplification:** This expression looks a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify the fraction to make it easier to evaluate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Simplify \\( \\frac{1}{2 - \\frac{3}{x}} \\)**\n\n- **Simplify the Denominator:**\n\n  \\[\n  2 - \\frac{3}{x} = \\frac{2x - 3}{x}\n  \\]\n\n- **Reciprocal:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2 - \\frac{3}{x}} = \\frac{x}{2x - 3}\n  \\]\n\n- **So, \\( g(x) \\) becomes:**\n\n  \\[\n  g(x) = \\frac{x}{2x - 3} + 9\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Check:** Does this simplification make sense? Let me verify by multiplying back.\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{\\frac{2x - 3}{x}} = \\frac{x}{2x - 3}\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Yes, the simplification is valid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Evaluate \\( g(3) \\)**\n\n- **Plug \\( x = 3 \\) into \\( g(x) \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  g(3) = \\frac{3}{2(3) - 3} + 9 = \\frac{3}{6 - 3} + 9 = \\frac{3}{3} + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does this result make sense? The calculations seem straightforward, but let's double-check each step.\n\n  - \\( 2(3) - 3 = 6 - 3 = 3 \\)\n  - \\( \\frac{3}{3} = 1 \\)\n  - \\( 1 + 9 = 10 \\)\n\n- **Reflection:** Everything checks out. The answer is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy Verification**\n\n- **Recall Strategy 2:** Initially, I thought about finding a direct relationship between \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) ) without explicitly finding the inverse. Would that have worked?\n\n  - **Realization:** Given that \\( g(x) \\) involves \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), it's likely that finding the inverse was necessary. Therefore, **Strategy 1** was the right path.\n\n- **Final Thoughts:** Starting with **Strategy 1** was the correct move. Although exploring other strategies is valuable, in this case, directly finding \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) and substituting it into \\( g(x) \\) led to a straightforward solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>\n10\n</ANSWER>\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Initial Approach:** I began by considering multiple strategies, including finding the inverse and looking for relationships between functions. Ultimately, finding the inverse was the most effective path.\n\n- **Checking Work:** Throughout the process, I consistently checked each step to ensure correctness, verified the inverse function, and performed quick calculations to confirm the final result.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Although I explored other strategies, they didn't seem as straightforward as directly finding the inverse. It's essential to consider multiple approaches, but being flexible and adaptive led to the correct solution.\n\n- **Final Answer:** After carefully following the steps and verifying each part, the final answer is \\( g(3) = 10 \\).\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This human-like approach involves brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and constantly checking for correctness. It mimics the natural thought process of tackling a problem, ensuring a thorough and accurate solution.",
