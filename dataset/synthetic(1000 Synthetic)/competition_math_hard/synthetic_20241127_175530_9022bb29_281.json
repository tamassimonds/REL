  "solution": "Certainly! Let's dive into this problem, embracing natural thought processes, brainstorming, reflections, and checks to develop a complete and coherent solution step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming: First Thoughts**\n\n**Initial Recognition:**  \n- We have two linear functions:  \n  \\( f(x) = Ax + B \\)  \n  \\( g(x) = Bx + A \\)  \n- There's a condition:  \n  \\( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = B - A \\)  \n- **Objective:** Find \\( A + B \\) given that \\( A \\neq B \\).\n\n**Immediate Reactions:**  \n- This reminds me of problems involving **compositions of functions**. Maybe I need to compute \\( f(g(x)) \\) and \\( g(f(x)) \\), then see what happens when subtracting them.\n- Could there be a **simpler approach**, like setting specific values for \\( x \\) to uncover relationships? Or perhaps examining **symmetries** since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are swapped in \\( f \\) and \\( g \\).\n\n**Uncertainty:**  \n- What if direct computation gets messy? Maybe there's a **trick** I'm missing.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Starting Point:** I think I'll start by computing \\( f(g(x)) \\) and \\( g(f(x)) \\) since that's directly involved in the given equation. If that doesn't lead anywhere, I'll reconsider other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Compute \\( f(g(x)) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Plan:** Let\u2019s find \\( f(g(x)) \\) by plugging \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**Computation:**  \n- Given:  \n  \\( g(x) = Bx + A \\)  \n- Substitute \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\):  \n  \\[  \n  f(g(x)) = f(Bx + A) = A(Bx + A) + B  \n  \\]  \n- **Simplification:**  \n  \\[  \n  = ABx + A^2 + B  \n  \\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Quick Check:**  \n  - Multiplying out the terms gives a linear expression, which makes sense since both \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are linear.\n- **Confidence:**  \n  - So far, so good. Let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Compute \\( g(f(x)) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Plan:** Now, find \\( g(f(x)) \\) by plugging \\( f(x) \\) into \\( g(x) \\).\n\n**Computation:**  \n- Given:  \n  \\( f(x) = Ax + B \\)  \n- Substitute \\( f(x) \\) into \\( g(x) \\):  \n  \\[  \n  g(f(x)) = g(Ax + B) = B(Ax + B) + A  \n  \\]  \n- **Simplification:**  \n  \\[  \n  = ABx + B^2 + A  \n  \\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Quick Check:**  \n  - End up with a linear expression. Comparing it to \\( f(g(x)) \\), the coefficients of \\( x \\) are the same, which might be significant.\n- **Observation:**  \n  - The constant terms differ, which will play a role when subtracting the two expressions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Compute \\( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Plan:** Subtract \\( g(f(x)) \\) from \\( f(g(x)) \\) as per the given equation.\n\n**Computation:**  \n\\[  \nf(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = (ABx + A^2 + B) - (ABx + B^2 + A)  \n\\]  \n- **Simplification:**  \n\\[  \n= ABx + A^2 + B - ABx - B^2 - A  \n\\]  \n\\[  \n= A^2 - A + B - B^2  \n\\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Quick Check:**  \n  - The \\( ABx \\) terms cancel out, leaving only constants, which aligns with the right side of the given equation \\( B - A \\).\n- **Confidence:**  \n  - The expression simplifies nicely, so it seems like we're on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Set Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Plan:** According to the problem, set the simplified expression equal to \\( B - A \\).\n\n**Equation:**  \n\\[  \nA^2 - A + B - B^2 = B - A  \n\\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Initial Reaction:**  \n  - This looks like a quadratic equation in terms of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). I might need to rearrange terms and see if I can factor or simplify further.\n- **Alternative Idea:**  \n  - Maybe substituting \\( A - B = x \\) could help, but let's see how it goes by directly manipulating the equation first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Rearrange the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Plan:** Move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero, which might make it easier to factor or solve.\n\n**Rearrangement:**  \n\\[  \nA^2 - A + B - B^2 - B + A = 0  \n\\]  \n\n- **Simplification:**  \n\\[  \nA^2 - B^2 = 0  \n\\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Quick Check:**  \n  - Wait a minute! \\( A^2 - B^2 = 0 \\) implies \\( A^2 = B^2 \\), which means \\( A = B \\) or \\( A = -B \\).\n- **Problem:**  \n  - But the problem states \\( A \\neq B \\). So, does this mean \\( A = -B \\)?\n- **Alternative Strategy:**  \n  - Given \\( A \\neq B \\) and \\( A^2 = B^2 \\), the only possibility is \\( A = -B \\). This seems like an important insight.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Analyze the Result**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Implication:** If \\( A = -B \\), then \\( A + B = 0 \\).\n\n**Verification:**  \n- **Substitution:**  \n  - If \\( A = -B \\), then:  \n    \\( f(x) = Ax + B = -Bx + B \\)  \n    \\( g(x) = Bx + A = Bx - B \\)  \n- **Compute \\( f(g(x)) \\) and \\( g(f(x)) \\):**  \n  - \\( g(x) = Bx - B \\)  \n  - \\( f(g(x)) = f(Bx - B) = -B(Bx - B) + B = -B^2x + B^2 + B \\)  \n  - \\( f(x) = -Bx + B \\)  \n  - \\( g(f(x)) = g(-Bx + B) = B(-Bx + B) - B = -B^2x + B^2 - B \\)  \n- **Subtract:**  \n\\[  \nf(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = (-B^2x + B^2 + B) - (-B^2x + B^2 - B) = 2B  \n\\]  \n- **Given Condition:**  \n\\[  \nf(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = B - A = B - (-B) = 2B  \n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The condition is satisfied, so \\( A = -B \\) is indeed correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Final Check:**  \n  - Everything aligns. The original condition is satisfied with \\( A = -B \\), leading to \\( A + B = 0 \\).\n- **Confidence:**  \n  - I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully analyzing and verifying each step, we conclude that:  \n\\(<ANSWER> A + B = 0 </ANSWER>\\)  \n\n---\n\n### **Solution Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, computing function compositions, and reflecting on the results, we determined that \\( A + B = 0 \\). Along the way, we verified that \\( A = -B \\) satisfies the given condition \\( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = B - A \\), ensuring the correctness of our solution. \n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \n- **Approach Validation:** Starting with function compositions was effective. Alternative strategies were considered but not needed once the primary approach yielded clear results.\n- **Verification:** Substituting \\( A = -B \\) back into the original condition confirmed the solution's validity. Always verify solutions, especially when conditional constraints like \\( A \\neq B \\) are present.\n- **Conclusion:** Systematic exploration and verification led to the correct conclusion that \\( A + B = 0 \\).",
