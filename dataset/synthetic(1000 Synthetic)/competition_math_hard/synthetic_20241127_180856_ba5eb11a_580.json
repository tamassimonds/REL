  "problem": "Let $f(x) = (x+2)^2-5$. If the domain of $f$ is all real numbers, then $f$ does not have an inverse function, but if we restrict the domain of $f$ to an interval $[c,\\infty)$, then $f$ may have an inverse function. What is the smallest value of $c$ we can use here, so that $f$ does have an inverse function?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we have the function \n\n\\[\nf(x) = (x+2)^2 - 5\n\\]\n\nThe domain is all real numbers, but we know that as it stands, \\( f \\) doesn't have an inverse function. The question asks us to find the smallest value of \\( c \\) such that by restricting the domain to \\([c, \\infty)\\), \\( f \\) becomes invertible.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Recognizing the Function Type:** This looks like a quadratic function since it involves squaring \\( x \\). Quadratic functions are generally parabolas, which I remember are not one-to-one by default (meaning they don't pass the Horizontal Line Test).\n\n- **Inverse Function Requirement:** For a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one (bijective) over its domain. This means that each output is associated with exactly one input.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**  \n  - **Restricting the Domain:** Since quadratics are parabolas, restricting the domain to one side (either the left or right of the vertex) might make the function one-to-one.  \n  - **Finding the Vertex:** The vertex of the parabola might be the key point where the function changes direction, so starting from there could be helpful.  \n  - **Graphical Approach:** Visualizing the function might help in understanding which part of the parabola to keep.  \n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\nLet's start by finding the vertex of the parabola and see if restricting the domain from the vertex onwards makes the function invertible.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Vertex of the Parabola**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I know that for a quadratic function in the form \\( (x-h)^2 + k \\), the vertex is at \\( (h, k) \\).\n- Our function is \n\n\\[\nf(x) = (x+2)^2 - 5\n\\]\n\nso comparing it to \\( (x-h)^2 + k \\), I see that:\n  - \\( h = -2 \\)\n  - \\( k = -5 \\)\n- Therefore, the vertex is at \\( (-2, -5) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, the vertex is the point where the parabola changes direction. For a parabola opening upwards (which this one does since the coefficient of \\( (x+2)^2 \\) is positive), the vertex is the minimum point.\n- **Implications for Invertibility:** If we restrict the domain to start from the vertex and extend to infinity, the function should be one-to-one.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Appropriate Domain Restriction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Restricting to \\([c, \\infty)\\):** We need to find the smallest \\( c \\) such that \\( f(x) \\) is one-to-one.\n- Since the vertex is at \\( x = -2 \\), and the function is symmetric around this point, starting the domain at \\( x = -2 \\) should ensure that the function is one-to-one.\n\n**Checking Strategy:**\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** What if \\( c \\) were greater than \\(-2\\)? Would that still work?\n  - If \\( c > -2 \\), we're cutting off part of the parabola, but starting at the minimum point ensures we're capturing the entire one-to-one portion.\n- **Conclusion:** The smallest \\( c \\) is indeed \\(-2\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is This Correct?** It seems logical because starting at the vertex ensures that the function doesn't repeat any y-values.\n- **But Wait:** Let me double-check by considering the Horizontal Line Test. Only one y-value for each x-value confirms that it's one-to-one on \\([c, \\infty)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying Invertibility with the Chosen Domain**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Applying the Horizontal Line Test:** If no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once over the domain \\([c, \\infty)\\), then the function is one-to-one.\n- Since we're starting at the vertex and moving right, the function should pass this test.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Graph Behavior:** From \\( x = -2 \\) onwards, the function is strictly increasing because the derivative \n\n\\[\nf'(x) = 2(x+2)\n\\]\n\nis positive for \\( x > -2 \\).\n- **Derivative Check:**\n  - \n\n\\[\nf'(x) = 2(x+2)\n\\]\n  \n  - For \\( x \\geq -2 \\), \\( f'(x) \\geq 0 \\)\n  \n  - This confirms that the function is non-decreasing, and since it's actually increasing for \\( x > -2 \\), it's one-to-one.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Confirm Invertibility?** Yes, since the function is strictly increasing from \\( x = -2 \\) onwards, it is one-to-one, and therefore invertible on this domain.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Revisiting the Original Question:** We needed to find the smallest \\( c \\) such that \\( f \\) is invertible on \\([c, \\infty)\\).\n- We've determined that \\( c = -2 \\) satisfies this condition.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Is \\( c = -2 \\) the Smallest Value?** Yes, because starting the domain at any point greater than \\(-2\\) would still make the function one-to-one, but \\(-2\\) is the smallest point where the function begins increasing.\n- **Alternative Verification:** Considering any \\( c < -2 \\) would include parts of the parabola where the function is decreasing, violating the one-to-one requirement.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n\\(<3>\\)<ANSWER>solution</ANSWER>\\(</3>\\)\n\nThe smallest value of \\( c \\) that makes \n\n\\[\nf(x) = (x+2)^2 - 5\n\\]\n\ninvertible on \\([c, \\infty)\\) is **\\( c = -2 \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Did I Explore Different Strategies?** Yes, I considered restricting the domain starting from the vertex and verified it using the derivative and the Horizontal Line Test.\n- **Did I Check My Work?** Throughout the process, I repeatedly checked whether the function was one-to-one and confirmed that \\( c = -2 \\) was the smallest value ensuring invertibility.\n- **Reflection on the Approach:** Starting at the vertex was key since it's the point where the function transitions from decreasing to increasing, making it the natural starting point for invertibility.\n\nBy thoroughly exploring and reflecting at each step, I've ensured that \\( c = -2 \\) is indeed the correct and smallest value for making \\( f \\) invertible.",
  "ground_truth": "For $f$ to have an inverse function, it must not take any repeated value -- that is, we must not have $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ for distinct $x_1$ and $x_2$ in its domain.\n\nThe graph of $y=(x+2)^2-5$ is a parabola with vertex at $(-2,-5)$:\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.2 cm);\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(4);\n\nxaxis(-6,3,Ticks(f, 1.0, Size=1));\nyaxis(-6,5,Ticks(f, 1.0, Size=1));\n\nreal g(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn (x+2)^2-5;\n}\n\ndraw(graph(g,-5.2,1.2));\ndot((-2,-5));\nlabel(\"Vertex: $(-2,-5)$\", (-2,-5), SW);\n[/asy] The axis of symmetry is the line $x=-2$, so for every $x$ less than $-2$, there is a corresponding $x$ greater than $-2$ where $f$ takes the same value. If we restrict the domain of $f$ to $[-2,\\infty)$, then $f$ has no repeated values, as $f$ is increasing throughout its domain. But if we restrict the domain to $[c,\\infty)$ where $c<-2$, then $f$ has repeated values. So, the smallest $c$ which will work is $c=\\boxed{-2}$."
