  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think it through. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to ensure I'm on the right track, and check my work frequently. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with polynomials \\( f \\) and \\( g \\), and the function \\( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \\). We're given that:\n\n- The degree of \\( h(x) \\) is 6.\n- The degree of \\( f(x) \\) is 2.\n\n**Question:** What's the degree of \\( g(x) \\)?\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis looks like a composition problem where one polynomial is plugged into another. I remember that the degree of a composition \\( f(g(x)) \\) usually involves multiplying the degrees of \\( f \\) and \\( g \\). However, adding \\( g(x) \\) to \\( f(g(x)) \\) complicates things a bit. Hmm... I think exploring how the degrees interact would be a good starting point.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Composition:**  \n   Calculate the degree of \\( f(g(x)) \\) and see how adding \\( g(x) \\) affects it.\n\n2. **Experiment with Sample Polynomials:**  \n   Use simple polynomials to see how their degrees combine.\n\n3. **Analyze Leading Terms:**  \n   Focus on the leading terms of each polynomial to determine how they contribute to \\( h(x) \\).\n\n4. **Consider Different Degrees for \\( g(x) \\):**  \n   Assume various degrees for \\( g(x) \\) and see which one fits the given conditions.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nStarting with the **Direct Composition** seems logical, but if that doesn't work, I'll try experimenting with sample polynomials. Analyzing leading terms can provide insight, and considering different degrees for \\( g(x) \\) can help verify the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Direct Composition Approach**\n\n**Idea:**  \nFind the degree of \\( f(g(x)) \\) and then see how adding \\( g(x) \\) affects the overall degree of \\( h(x) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI know that the degree of \\( f(g(x)) \\) should be the product of the degrees of \\( f \\) and \\( g \\). Let's denote:\n\n- Degree of \\( g(x) \\) as \\( d \\).\n- Degree of \\( f(x) \\) is given as 2.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nThe degree of \\( f(g(x)) \\) would be \\( 2 \\times d \\).\n\n**Check:**  \nSo, \\( f(g(x)) \\) has degree \\( 2d \\). But wait, we're adding \\( g(x) \\) which has degree \\( d \\). How does this addition affect the overall degree?\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nAdding polynomials can change the degree only if the highest degree terms cancel out. Otherwise, the higher degree term dominates.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe degree of \\( h(x) \\) should be the maximum of \\( 2d \\) and \\( d \\), unless there's cancellation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing Possible Degree Relationships**\n\n**Idea:**  \nSince the degree of \\( h(x) \\) is 6, set up an equation based on the maximum degree after addition.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe degree of \\( h(x) \\) is determined by the highest degree term between \\( f(g(x)) \\) and \\( g(x) \\). So:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Degree of } h(x) = \\max(2d, d) = 6\n\\]\n\n**Case Analysis:**\n\n- If \\( 2d > d \\):  \n  Then \\( 2d = 6 \\)  \n  \\( d = 3 \\)\n\n- If \\( 2d = d \\):  \n  This implies \\( d = 0 \\), which doesn't make sense here because \\( g(x) \\) would be a constant, and \\( h(x) \\) would also have a lower degree.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nFrom \\( 2d = 6 \\), we get \\( d = 3 \\).\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? If \\( d = 3 \\), then:\n\n- \\( f(g(x)) \\) has degree \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\)\n- \\( g(x) \\) has degree 3\n\nThe higher degree term is 6, which matches the given degree of \\( h(x) \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThis seems correct, but let's verify by considering potential cancellations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Checking for Cancellation of Leading Terms**\n\n**Idea:**  \nEnsure that there's no cancellation between \\( f(g(x)) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) that would lower the degree of \\( h(x) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nCancellation would occur if the leading terms of \\( f(g(x)) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are identical but opposite in sign. Let's explore whether that's possible.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\n- Let's assume the leading coefficient of \\( g(x) \\) is \\( a_d \\) and the leading term is \\( a_d x^d \\).\n  \n- The leading term of \\( f(g(x)) \\) would be affected by the leading term of \\( g(x) \\). Since \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 2, its leading term when applied to \\( g(x) \\) would involve \\( (g(x))^2 \\).\n\n- So, the leading term of \\( f(g(x)) \\) would be proportional to \\( (a_d x^d)^2 = a_d^2 x^{2d} \\).\n\n- The leading term of \\( g(x) \\) is \\( a_d x^d \\).\n\n**Potential Cancellation:**  \nFor cancellation to occur:\n\n\\[\na_d^2 x^{2d} + a_d x^d = 0\n\\]\n\nThis would require coefficients to cancel out, but since \\( x^{2d} \\) and \\( x^d \\) are different powers, they can't cancel unless specific conditions are met, which are unlikely in general.\n\n**Check:**  \nIs cancellation possible here? Given that \\( f(x) \\) is of degree 2 and \\( g(x) \\) is of degree 3, \\( f(g(x)) \\) has degree 6, and \\( g(x) \\) has degree 3. The leading terms don't cancel because they are of different degrees.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nNo cancellation occurs, so the degree of \\( h(x) \\) remains 6. This supports our earlier conclusion that \\( d = 3 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying with Sample Polynomials**\n\n**Idea:**  \nLet's test our conclusion by plugging in sample polynomials for \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) to see if \\( h(x) \\) has the correct degree.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nUsing specific examples can help confirm whether our theoretical solution holds up.\n\n**Example:**  \n\n- Let \\( g(x) = x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\) (degree 3)\n- Let \\( f(x) = ax^2 + ex + f \\) (degree 2)\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\n- Compute \\( f(g(x)) \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  f(g(x)) = a(g(x))^2 + e(g(x)) + f\n  \\]\n  \n  Expanding \\( (g(x))^2 \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  (x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)^2 = x^6 + 2bx^5 + (b^2 + 2c)x^4 + \\ldots\n  \\]\n  \n  So, \\( f(g(x)) \\) has a leading term \\( ax^6 \\).\n\n- Compute \\( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  h(x) = [ax^6 + \\ldots] + [x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d]\n  \\]\n  \n  The leading term is \\( ax^6 \\), indicating the degree of \\( h(x) \\) is 6.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes the degree of \\( h(x) \\) match the given degree? Yes, it does.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThis sample confirms that with \\( g(x) \\) having a degree of 3, \\( h(x) \\) indeed has a degree of 6. Our earlier calculation is validated.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThroughout the process, we considered multiple strategies:\n\n- Directly calculating the degree of \\( f(g(x)) \\) and \\( g(x) \\)\n- Analyzing potential cancellations\n- Verifying with sample polynomials\n\nEach step consistently led us to the same conclusion without encountering any contradictions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe degree of \\( g(x) \\) is 3.\n\n\\(\\boxed{d = 3}\\)\n\n**Final Check:**  \nDoes this solution satisfy all given conditions? Yes, with \\( d = 3 \\), the degree of \\( h(x) \\) is 6, aligning perfectly with the problem statement.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically\u2014starting with direct composition, analyzing potential cancellations, and verifying with examples\u2014we confidently determined that the degree of \\( g(x) \\) is 3. Checking each step ensured that no errors were made, and reflecting frequently helped in validating the correctness of the solution.",
  "ground_truth": "$f(g(x))$ must have a degree of 6, because it will produce the term with the greatest exponent of the polynomial. Because $f(x)$ is a degree 2 polynomial, we can write that $f(x)=bx^2+cx+d$. The term with the greatest exponent in $f(g(x))$ comes from taking $bx^2$ or $b(g(x))^2$. Let $g(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x^{1}+a_0$. Then, the highest degree term of $f(g(x))$ is $b(a_nx^n)^2$, which equals $ba_{n}^2x^{2n}$. Since the degree of $h$ is 6, we have $2n=6$, so $n=3$.  Therefore, the degree of $g$ is $\\boxed{3}$."
