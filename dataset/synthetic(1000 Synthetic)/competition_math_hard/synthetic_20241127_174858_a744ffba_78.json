  "solution": "### Natural Approach to Solving the Problem\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem as naturally as possible. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's begin by really understanding what's being asked.\n\n---\n\n### First Thoughts\n\nHmm, okay. Sue has 11 pairs of shoes: six black, three brown, and two gray. All pairs are identical in color. The question asks for the probability that if she picks two shoes at random, they are:\n\n1. **The same color**\n2. **One is a left shoe and the other is a right shoe**\n\nAt first glance, this seems like a probability problem involving combinations. My initial thought is to calculate the total number of ways to pick two shoes and then determine how many of those picks meet the criteria. But I'm not entirely sure if that approach will work perfectly, so let's brainstorm a bit.\n\n---\n\n### Exploring Different Strategies\n\n1. **Total Combinations Approach:** Calculate the total ways to pick any two shoes and then find the number of favorable outcomes.\n   \n2. **Color-Specific Probability:** Calculate the probability for each color separately and then sum them up.\n   \n3. **Using Combinations with Left and Right Shoes:** Since each pair has a left and a right shoe, maybe I should consider that aspect explicitly.\n\nLet's start with the **Total Combinations Approach** and see if it works. If not, we'll pivot to another strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Shoes\n\nFirst, let's identify the total number of shoes Sue has.\n\n- **11 pairs** mean **22 shoes** in total (since each pair has a left and a right shoe).\n\nAlright, so there are 22 shoes in total. That makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Total Ways to Pick Two Shoes\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of ways to pick any two shoes from the 22 available.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = \\binom{22}{2} = \\frac{22 \\times 21}{2} = 231\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 231 possible ways to pick any two shoes. This seems straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Reflection Moment\n\nWait a minute... If I only focus on the total combinations, am I considering the left and right shoes properly? The problem specifically mentions that one must be a left shoe and the other a right shoe. Maybe I need to incorporate that into my calculations. Let's see how we can adjust our approach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identifying Favorable Outcomes\n\nI need to find the number of ways to pick two shoes that are:\n\n- The **same color**\n- One is a **left shoe** and the other is a **right shoe**\n\nLet's think about how to calculate this for each color.\n\n#### Option 1: Calculating for Each Color Separately\n\n**Black Shoes:**\n\n- **6 pairs** means 6 left and 6 right black shoes.\n- I can pick one left and one right shoe from these.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ways for black} = 6 \\times 6 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Brown Shoes:**\n\n- **3 pairs** means 3 left and 3 right brown shoes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ways for brown} = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n\\]\n\n**Gray Shoes:**\n\n- **2 pairs** means 2 left and 2 right gray shoes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ways for gray} = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Total Favorable Outcomes:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total favorable} = 36 + 9 + 4 = 49\n\\]\n\nHmm, so there are 49 favorable outcomes where the two shoes are of the same color and are one left and one right. This makes sense so far.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Probability\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Total favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total possible outcomes}} = \\frac{49}{231}\n\\]\n\nBefore finalizing, let's simplify this fraction.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{49}{231} = \\frac{49 \\div 7}{231 \\div 7} = \\frac{7}{33}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability is \\(\\frac{7}{33}\\).\n\n---\n\n### Reflection and Validation\n\nLet me double-check my approach to ensure it's correct.\n\n- I considered all pairs of the same color.\n- For each color, I calculated the number of ways to pick a left and a right shoe.\n- Added these up to get the total favorable outcomes.\n- Divided by the total number of ways to pick any two shoes.\n\nEverything seems to align. But wait, let's think again...\n\n---\n\n### Alternative Approach: Considering Left and Right Shoes Separately\n\nSuppose I consider the total number of left and right shoes separately. Maybe that'll provide another perspective to confirm our answer.\n\n**Total Left Shoes:** 11 (one for each pair)\n\n**Total Right Shoes:** 11\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick one left and one right shoe, regardless of color, would be:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 11 = 121\n\\]\n\nBut this includes combinations where the colors don't match. To find the probability that the colors do match, I need to ensure that the left and right shoes are from the same pair.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe sticking to the original approach is better. But it's good to explore different methods to confirm correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nLet's put everything together once more to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Total Shoes:** 22\n- **Total Ways to Pick Two Shoes:** \\(\\binom{22}{2} = 231\\)\n- **Favorable Outcomes:**\n  - Black: \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)\n  - Brown: \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\)\n  - Gray: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n  - **Total Favorable:** \\(36 + 9 + 4 = 49\\)\n- **Probability:** \\(\\frac{49}{231} = \\frac{7}{33}\\)\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### Final Solution\n\nThe probability that Sue picks two shoes of the same color, with one being a left shoe and the other a right shoe, is \\(\\frac{7}{33}\\).\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and validating the approach, we arrived at the correct probability. It's essential to brainstorm, check, and adjust methods to ensure accuracy in problem-solving.",
  "ground_truth": "We will consider these by the cases of what our first shoe selection is. If our first shoe is black, which happens with probability $\\frac{12}{22}$, then our second shoe will be black and for the opposite foot with probability $\\frac{6}{21}$. Likewise, for brown shoes, our probability is the product $\\frac{6}{22} \\cdot \\frac{3}{21}$. And for gray, $\\frac{4}{22} \\cdot \\frac{2}{21}$. So the sum is equal to $\\frac{12\\cdot 6 + 6 \\cdot 3 + 4 \\cdot 2}{22 \\cdot 21} = \\frac{98}{33\\cdot 14} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{33}}$."
