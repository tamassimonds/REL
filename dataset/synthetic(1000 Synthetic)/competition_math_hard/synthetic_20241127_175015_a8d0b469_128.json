  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's walk through the problem step-by-step, keeping the original reasoning intact while refining it for clarity and coherence. I'll maintain the conversational tone, reflecting on each part to ensure the thought process is clear and logical.\n\n---\n\n**Problem:**  \nSimplify \\(\\sqrt{50} + \\sqrt{18}\\) to its simplest radical form.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nAlright, looking at this problem:  \n\\(\\sqrt{50} + \\sqrt{18}\\)\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nHmm, this involves adding square roots. I remember dealing with similar problems before, where simplifying the square roots made things easier. But it's been a while, so let me brainstorm a few strategies to find the best approach.\n\n**Initial Ideas:**  \n1. **Prime Factorization:**  \n   Maybe I can break down 50 and 18 into their prime factors to see if any perfect squares are involved.  \n   *Wait, does that always work for simplifying square roots? I think so; pulling out perfect squares could simplify the radicals.*\n\n2. **Decimal Approximation:**  \n   I could convert the square roots into decimal form and add them up.  \n   *But hold on, the question asks for the simplest radical form, so this might not be the right path.*\n\n3. **Using a Calculator:**  \n   A calculator would give a quick numerical answer, but again, it's not in radical form.  \n   *So, probably not the best choice here.*\n\n**Reflection:**  \nConsidering the goal is to express the sum in the simplest radical form, **prime factorization** seems like the most suitable strategy. Decimal approximation and using a calculator would only provide a numerical answer, which isn't what we're looking for.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\nOkay, let's start by breaking down each number under the square roots into their prime factors.\n\n#### **Thinking Process:**\n\n- **For 50:**  \n  I know 50 is an even number, so dividing by 2 should work.  \n  \\(50 \\div 2 = 25\\)  \n  Now, 25 is \\(5 \\times 5\\), which is \\(5^2\\).\n\n  So, the prime factors of 50 are:  \n  \\(50 = 2 \\times 5^2\\)\n\n- **For 18:**  \n  Similarly, 18 is even, so dividing by 2:  \n  \\(18 \\div 2 = 9\\)  \n  And 9 is \\(3 \\times 3\\), which is \\(3^2\\).\n\n  So, the prime factors of 18 are:  \n  \\(18 = 2 \\times 3^2\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems correct. Both numbers are broken down into their prime factors, and I can see perfect squares present, which should help in simplifying the square roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying Each Square Root**\n\nNow, I'll use the prime factors to simplify each square root by extracting the perfect squares.\n\n#### **For \\(\\sqrt{50}\\):**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  From the prime factorization:  \n  \\(50 = 2 \\times 5^2\\)  \n  I can take \\(5^2\\) out of the square root because the square root of a square is the base number.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\(\\sqrt{50} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 5^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{5^2} = 5\\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Does this make sense?  \n  Yeah, because \\(5^2 = 25\\) and \\(25 \\times 2 = 50\\), so it checks out.\n\n#### **For \\(\\sqrt{18}\\):**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  From the prime factorization:  \n  \\(18 = 2 \\times 3^2\\)  \n  I can take \\(3^2\\) out of the square root.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\(\\sqrt{18} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 3^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Again, \\(3^2 = 9\\) and \\(9 \\times 2 = 18\\), so this simplification is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth square roots are now simplified. I feel confident that this step is correct because extracting the perfect squares checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Adding the Simplified Radicals**\n\nNow, I need to add \\(5\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(3\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Like Terms:**  \n  Wait a minute, both terms have \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), so they're like terms.  \n  I can add the coefficients (the numbers in front of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)).\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\(5\\sqrt{2} + 3\\sqrt{2} = (5 + 3)\\sqrt{2} = 8\\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Adding 5 and 3 gives 8, so this seems correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis was straightforward. Since both terms had the same radical part, adding the coefficients was just like regular addition. I feel confident that this step is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's do a quick check to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Does the Simplification Hold?**  \n  Initially, I had \\(\\sqrt{50} + \\sqrt{18}\\).  \n  Simplified, it became \\(8\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n- **Decimal Approximation:**  \n  Maybe I should approximate both sides to see if they match.  \n  Let me grab a calculator real quick.\n\n- **Calculations:**  \n  \\(\\sqrt{50} \\approx 7.07\\)  \n  \\(\\sqrt{18} \\approx 4.24\\)  \n  Adding them: \\(7.07 + 4.24 \\approx 11.31\\)\n\n  Now, checking the simplified form:  \n  \\(8\\sqrt{2} \\approx 8 \\times 1.41 \\approx 11.28\\)\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Hmm, there's a slight difference due to rounding, but it's close enough to confirm that the simplification is correct. The small discrepancy is just from approximating the square root of 2.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nEverything seems to align. The simplified form \\(8\\sqrt{2}\\) accurately represents the original expression \\(\\sqrt{50} + \\sqrt{18}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter breaking down the problem and reflecting at each step, the simplified radical form of \\(\\sqrt{50} + \\sqrt{18}\\) is:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{8\\sqrt{2}}\\)\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nApproaching the problem step-by-step, starting with prime factorization, simplifying each square root, adding the like terms, and finally checking the work ensured that the solution was correct. Even though I considered different strategies at the beginning, prime factorization proved to be the most effective method for simplifying the expression. Regular checks along the way helped confirm that each step was accurate, leading to a reliable final answer.\n\n**Additional Thoughts:**  \nThinking aloud and being open to exploring different strategies\u2014even if they don't all lead directly to the solution\u2014can be valuable. It helps in understanding the problem better and ensuring that the chosen path is indeed the correct one. This approach not only reinforces the correctness of the solution but also deepens the conceptual understanding of simplifying radicals.\n\n---\n\nThere you have it! By carefully considering different strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying the final result, we arrived at the correct simplified radical form: \\(8\\sqrt{2}\\).",
  "ground_truth": "Prime factorizing 50, we find that $\\sqrt{50}=\\sqrt{2\\cdot5^2}=\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{5^2}=5\\sqrt{2}$.  Similarly, $\\sqrt{18}=\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{9}=3\\sqrt{2}$.  Five square roots of 2 plus 3 square roots of 2 is $\\boxed{8\\sqrt{2}}$."
