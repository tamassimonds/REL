  "solution": "Absolutely, let's piece everything together into a cohesive, polished solution while maintaining the original insights and reflections. I'll ensure clarity and consistency throughout the process.\n\n---\n\n# **Solving the Inverse Variation Problem**\n\n## **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to determine the value of \\(x\\) when \\(y = 4000\\), given that \\(x^2\\) and \\(y\\) vary inversely. Additionally, we're provided with the condition that \\(y = 10\\) when \\(x = 2\\).\n\n## **First Thoughts: Revisiting the Initial Approach**\n\nInitially, I attempted to establish an inverse relationship between \\(x^2\\) and \\(y\\), which seemed logical. However, since my previous answer was incorrect, it's clear that I need to reassess my strategy.\n\n### **Brainstorming: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n- **Inverse Variation:** Typically, if two quantities vary inversely, their product remains constant.\n- **Given Conditions:** I can use the provided values to determine the constant of proportionality.\n- **Applying the Constant:** Once the constant is known, I can solve for \\(x\\) when \\(y = 4000\\).\n\n### **Reflection: Identifying Potential Mistakes**\n\nWait a moment\u2014perhaps I didn't apply the inverse variation formula correctly earlier. Let's ensure that the relationship is set up accurately this time.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Establishing the Inverse Relationship**\n\n### **Thought Process: Setting Up the Equation**\n\nIf \\(x^2\\) and \\(y\\) vary inversely, their product is constant:\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\cdot y = k\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is the constant of proportionality.\n\n### **Initial Setup: Calculating the Constant \\(k\\)**\n\nGiven that \\(y = 10\\) when \\(x = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n(2)^2 \\cdot 10 = k \\\\\n4 \\cdot 10 = 40 = k\n\\]\n\n### **Checking: Validating the Calculation**\n\n- That seems correct\u2014\\(k = 40\\).\n- **Realization:** This makes sense because the product \\(x^2 \\cdot y\\) should remain constant.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Solving for \\(x\\) When \\(y = 4000\\)**\n\n### **Next Steps: Applying the Constant \\(k\\)**\n\nNow, I need to find \\(x\\) when \\(y = 4000\\) using \\(k = 40\\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\cdot 4000 = 40\n\\]\n\n### **Solving for \\(x^2\\): Simplifying the Equation**\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{40}{4000} = \\frac{1}{100}\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection: Ensuring Accuracy**\n\nHmm, let me double-check this:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{40}{4000} = \\frac{1}{100}\n\\]\n\n- **Confirmation:** The calculation is correct.\n\n### **Solving for \\(x\\): Finding the Positive Root**\n\nSince \\(x\\) is always positive:\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{100}} = \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n### **Verification: Plugging Back into the Original Equation**\n\nLet's confirm the solution by substituting \\(x = \\frac{1}{10}\\) back into the inverse relationship:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^2 \\cdot 4000 = \\frac{1}{100} \\cdot 4000 = 40\n\\]\n\n- **Outcome:** The product equals \\(k = 40\\), verifying the correctness of the solution.\n\n### **Final Check: Consistency with Given Conditions**\n\nThis aligns perfectly with the given condition that \\(x^2 \\cdot y\\) remains constant at 40. Therefore, the solution is valid.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion: Stating the Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = \\frac{1}{10}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## **Final Thoughts: Reflecting on the Learning Process**\n\n- **Original Insight:** Recognizing the inverse relationship between \\(x^2\\) and \\(y\\) was a solid starting point.\n- **Mistake:** Initially, there might have been an error in applying the inverse variation formula, leading to an incorrect answer.\n- **Correction:** By revisiting and correctly setting up the equation, the correct solution was achieved.\n- **Validation:** Verifying the solution through substitution ensured its accuracy.\n\n### **Learning Outcome:**\n\nBy reflecting on and adjusting my approach, I was able to identify and correct the error, ultimately arriving at the correct solution. This process highlights the importance of verification and being open to re-examining initial strategies.\n\n---\n\n**<ANSWER>solution \\(x = \\frac{1}{10}\\)</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\nThere we go! The solution now flows logically, incorporating reflections and validations to ensure accuracy while maintaining the original answer.",
  "ground_truth": "Since $x^2$ and $y$ are inversely proportional, their product is constant.  Thus $$2^2 \\cdot 10 = x^2 \\cdot 4000 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad x = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}.$$"
