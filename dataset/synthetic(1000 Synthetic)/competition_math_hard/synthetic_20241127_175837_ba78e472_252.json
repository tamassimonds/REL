No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Possible Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, I need to find distinct non-zero digits less than 5 that satisfy \\( 10H - 3E - S = 0 \\).  \n- Since there are only four possible digits (1, 2, 3, 4), I can try different combinations.\n\n**Considering Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Trial and Error:**  \n   - Test different combinations of \\( H \\), \\( E \\), and \\( S \\).\n\n2. **Logical Deduction:**  \n   - Use the equation to express one variable in terms of others and narrow down possibilities.\n\n**Starting with Trial and Error:**\n\n- **First Attempt:**  \n  - Let\u2019s try \\( H = 2 \\), \\( E = 3 \\), \\( S = 4 \\):  \n    - \\( 10(2) - 3(3) - 4 = 20 - 9 - 4 = 7 \\neq 0 \\)  \n  - **Conclusion:** Doesn't work.\n\n**Reflecting:**\n\n- **Wait:** This might take a while. Is there a better way?  \n- **Alternative Approach:**  \n  - Maybe express \\( S \\) in terms of \\( H \\) and \\( E \\) to make testing easier.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Algebraic Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- From the equation:\n\n\\[\n10H - 3E - S = 0 \\implies S = 10H - 3E\n\\]\n\n- Now, I'll substitute possible values for \\( H \\) and \\( E \\) and check if \\( S \\) is a valid digit (1 to 4).\n\n**Proceeding with Algebra:**\n\n- **Attempt 1:**  \n  - \\( H = 1 \\), \\( E = 2 \\):  \n    - \\( S = 10(1) - 3(2) = 10 - 6 = 4 \\)  \n    - **Check:** \\( S = 4 \\) is valid.  \n  - **Solution Found:**  \n    - \\( H = 1 \\), \\( E = 2 \\), \\( S = 4 \\)\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does it Satisfy the Original Equation?**  \n  - Let's plug these values back into the original addition:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n  & 4 & 1 & 2_5 \\\\\n+ &   & 1 & 2_5 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & 4 & 2 & 4_5 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n- **Base 5 Calculation:**  \n  - \\( 412_5 + 12_5 = 424_5 \\)  \n  - **Verification:**  \n    - Convert to base 10:  \n      - \\( 412_5 = 4 \\times 25 + 1 \\times 5 + 2 = 102 + 5 + 2 = 109 \\)  \n      - \\( 12_5 = 1 \\times 5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7 \\)  \n      - Sum: \\( 109 + 7 = 116 \\)  \n      - Convert \\( 424_5 \\) to base 10:  \n        - \\( 4 \\times 25 + 2 \\times 5 + 4 = 100 + 10 + 4 = 114 \\)  \n      - **Wait:** There's a discrepancy!  \n        - **Mistake:** The sum in base 10 should be 116, but \\( 424_5 \\) converts to 114.\n\n**Reflecting:**\n\n- **Hmm:** This indicates that the values don't fully satisfy the equation. Maybe there's a carry involved that I missed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Revisiting the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Actually:** I might need to consider carrying over in the addition since we're working in base 5.  \n- Let's re-examine the addition problem to see if a carry is necessary.\n\n**Analyzing the Columns:**\n\n1. **Rightmost Column (Units Place):**  \n   - \\( E + E = S \\)  \n   - **Possibility:** If \\( E + E \\geq 5 \\), there would be a carry.\n\n2. **Middle Column (Fives Place):**  \n   - \\( H + H + \\text{(carry if any)} = E \\)  \n   - **Note:** If there's a carry from the units place, it affects this sum.\n\n3. **Leftmost Column (Twenty-Fives Place):**  \n   - \\( S + \\text{(carry if any)} = S \\)  \n   - **Implication:** There can only be a carry here if \\( S = 4 \\) and there's a carry from the middle column.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Wait:** Since \\( S + \\text{(carry)} = S \\), the carry must be zero, or \\( S \\) must accommodate the carry.  \n- **Actually:** This imposes additional constraints on the values of \\( S \\), \\( H \\), and \\( E \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Incorporating Carry into the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Rightmost Column:**  \n  - \\( E + E = S + 5C_1 \\)  \n  - Where \\( C_1 \\) is the carry to the next column.  \n- **Middle Column:**  \n  - \\( H + H + C_1 = E + 5C_2 \\)  \n  - Where \\( C_2 \\) is the carry to the leftmost column.  \n- **Leftmost Column:**  \n  - \\( S + C_2 = S \\)  \n  - Hence, \\( C_2 = 0 \\).\n\n**Implications:**\n\n- **If \\( C_2 = 0 \\):**  \n  - There\u2019s no carry into the leftmost column, so \\( S \\) remains unchanged.  \n- **Therefore:**  \n  - \\( H + H + C_1 = E \\)  \n  - And \\( E + E = S + 5C_1 \\)\n\n**Simplifying the Equations:**\n\n1. \\( E + E = S + 5C_1 \\Rightarrow 2E = S + 5C_1 \\)  \n2. \\( H + H + C_1 = E \\Rightarrow 2H + C_1 = E \\)\n\n**Rewriting:**\n\n- From \\( 2H + C_1 = E \\), we get \\( C_1 = E - 2H \\)  \n- Substituting \\( C_1 \\) in the first equation:  \n  \\[ 2E = S + 5(E - 2H) \\]  \n  \\[ 2E = S + 5E - 10H \\]  \n  \\[ 0 = S + 3E - 10H \\]  \n  \\[ S = 10H - 3E \\]\n\n**Checking the Consistency:**\n\n- **Wait:** This is the same equation we derived earlier, but now we have additional insights about carries.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Solving for Digit Combinations with Carry**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, I'll look for combinations of \\( H \\), \\( E \\), and \\( S \\) that satisfy \\( S = 10H - 3E \\) and account for possible carries.  \n- Given that \\( S \\), \\( H \\), and \\( E \\) are distinct and less than 5, I\u2019ll systematically test valid combinations.\n\n---\n\n**Starting with \\( H = 1 \\):**\n\n- **Attempt 1:**  \n  - \\( H = 1 \\)  \n  - \\( S = 10(1) - 3E = 10 - 3E \\)  \n  - **Constraints:**  \n    - \\( S \\) must be a digit less than 5 and distinct from \\( H \\) and \\( E \\).  \n    - \\( E \\) must be a digit less than 5 and distinct from \\( S \\) and \\( H \\).\n\n**Calculating Possible \\( E \\) and \\( S \\):**\n\n- **If \\( E = 1 \\):**  \n  - \\( S = 10 - 3(1) = 7 \\)  \n  - **Issue:** \\( S = 7 \\) is not less than 5.  \n- **If \\( E = 2 \\):**  \n  - \\( S = 10 - 3(2) = 4 \\)  \n  - **Valid Combination:**  \n    - \\( H = 1 \\), \\( E = 2 \\), \\( S = 4 \\)\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does it Satisfy the Original Equation?**  \n  - Let's plug these values back into the addition problem with carries:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n  & 4 & 1 & 2_5 \\\\\n+ &   & 1 & 2_5 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & 4 & 2 & 4_5 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n- **Calculating Each Column:**\n\n  1. **Units Place:**  \n     - \\( E + E = 2 + 2 = 4 \\)  \n     - No carry, \\( S = 4 \\)  \n  2. **Fives Place:**  \n     - \\( H + H = 1 + 1 = 2 \\)  \n     - No carry, \\( E = 2 \\)  \n  3. **Twenty-Fives Place:**  \n     - \\( S = 4 \\), no carry\n\n- **Base 5 Addition Verification:**\n  \n  - \\( 412_5 + 12_5 = 424_5 \\)  \n  - **Convert to Base 10:**  \n    - \\( 412_5 = 4 \\times 25 + 1 \\times 5 + 2 = 100 + 5 + 2 = 107 \\)  \n    - \\( 12_5 = 1 \\times 5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7 \\)  \n    - Sum: \\( 107 + 7 = 114 \\)  \n    - \\( 424_5 = 4 \\times 25 + 2 \\times 5 + 4 = 100 + 10 + 4 = 114 \\)  \n  - **Conclusion:**  \n    - **Wait:** The sum matches! However, earlier, there was a discrepancy.  \n    - **Actually:** Let me double-check the base 5 addition...\n\n**Reflecting:**\n\n- **Hmm:** Upon re-evaluating, the base 5 addition seems correct now. Maybe the previous mistake was in the conversion.  \n- **Alternative Explanation:**  \n  - Initially, there might have been an error in calculating the sum or converting between bases.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Verifying Other Possible Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Actually:** To ensure that this is the only valid solution, I'll check other possible values of \\( H \\) and see if they yield valid \\( S \\) and \\( E \\).  \n- **Also, Just In Case:** This will confirm that no other combinations work, solidifying the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n**Attempt 2:**  \n- \\( H = 2 \\)  \n- \\( S = 10(2) -

3(3) = 11 \\)  \n  - **Issue:** \\( S = 11 \\) is not less than 5.  \n- **If \\( E = 4 \\):**  \n  - \\( S = 20 - 3(4) = 8 \\)  \n  - **Issue:** \\( S = 8 \\) is not less than 5.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Hmm:** No valid \\( E \\) when \\( H = 2 \\) that keeps \\( S \\) less than 5.\n\n---\n\n**Attempt 3:**  \n- \\( H = 3 \\)  \n- \\( S = 10(3) - 3E = 30 - 3E \\)\n\n**Possible \\( E \\):**\n\n- **If \\( E = 1 \\):**  \n  - \\( S = 30 - 3(1) = 27 \\)  \n  - **Issue:** \\( S = 27 \\) is not less than 5.  \n- **If \\( E = 2 \\):**  \n  - \\( S = 30 -

This satisfies our original equation as shown: $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &4&1&2_5\\\\ &+&1&2_5\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &4&2&4_5\\\\ \\end{array}$$Thus, $S+H+E=4+1+2=7$. In base $5$, the sum is then $\\boxed{12_5}$.\n\nNote: The other possible values for $E$ can also be checked. If $E$ equaled $3$, the residue $S$ would then equal $1$ and $1$ would be carried over. Since nothing carries over into the third column, $1+H+H$ would then have to equal $3$. However, $H$ can not equal $1$ because the digits must be distinct.\n\nIf $E$ equaled $4$, the residue $S$ would then equal $3$ and $1$ would be carried over. $1+H+H$ would then have to equal $4$, but $H$ can not be a decimal. Therefore, the above solution is the only possible one."
