  "solution": "## **Finding the Radius of the Larger Circle: A Step-by-Step Approach**\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n\n- **We have three smaller circles with a radius of 1, each externally tangent to one another and internally tangent to a larger circle.**\n- **Our goal is to determine the radius of this larger circle.**\n\nInitial Brainstorming:\n\n1. **Use geometric properties to find relationships between the circles.**\n2. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem if right triangles are involved.**\n3. **Consider using coordinate geometry to visualize the setup.**\n\nReflection:\n\n- **Visualizing the arrangement is crucial\u2014how do the smaller circles fit inside the larger one?**\n- **It reminds me of problems involving circle tangencies and equilateral triangles.**\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Geometry of Circle Centers**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- **Let\u2019s start by considering the centers of the three smaller circles.**\n- **Since each circle is externally tangent to the others, their centers form an equilateral triangle.**\n\nKey Insight:\n\n- **The side length of this equilateral triangle is equal to \\(2\\) (the sum of the radii of two tangent circles: \\(1 + 1\\)).**\n\nQuick Check:\n\n- **Does this make sense? Yes, because the distance between the centers of two tangent circles is the sum of their radii.**\n\nProceeding:\n\n- **Now, let's think about the larger circle. Its center should coincide with the circumcenter of this equilateral triangle.**\n- **This is because the larger circle is internally tangent to all three smaller circles.**\n\nReflection:\n\n- **So, finding the circumradius of the equilateral triangle will help us determine the distance from the center of the larger circle to the centers of the smaller circles.**\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating the Circumradius**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- **The circumradius (\\(R\\)) of an equilateral triangle can be found using the formula:**\n  \\[\n  R = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\n  \\]\n  where \\(s\\) is the side length of the triangle.\n\nPlugging in the Values:\n\n- **Given \\(s = 2\\):**\n  \\[\n  R = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n  \\]\n\nQuick Check:\n\n- **Is this reasonable? Yes, the circumradius should be larger than the inradius, aligning with the larger circle encompassing the smaller ones.**\n\nReflection:\n\n- **But wait, this \\(R\\) only represents the distance from the center of the larger circle to the centers of the smaller circles.**\n- **The radius of the larger circle should also account for the radius of the smaller circles.**\n\n---\n\n### **Adjusting the Strategy**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- **To find the actual radius of the larger circle (\\(R_{\\text{large}}\\)), we need to add the radius of the smaller circles to the circumradius.**\n- **This is because the larger circle's radius extends from its center to its circumference, passing through the center of a smaller circle and adding its radius.**\n\nCalculations:\n\n\\[\nR_{\\text{large}} = R + 1 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3} + 1\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nR_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3} + 3}{3}\n\\]\n\nQuick Check:\n\n- **Is this expression simplified? Yes, but it looks a bit clunky. Let's see if there's a better way to express it.**\n\n---\n\n### **Finalizing the Solution**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- **Let's re-examine the approach to ensure correctness.**\n- **Perhaps there's a simpler form for the final expression.**\n\nSimplification:\n\n\\[\nR_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\nR_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\nQuick Check:\n\n- **Does this make sense? Yes, the larger circle's radius appropriately accounts for both the circumradius of the equilateral triangle and the radius of the smaller circles.**\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Using Coordinate Geometry**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- **To confirm the solution, let's try placing the circles on a coordinate plane.**\n- **Assign coordinates to the centers of the smaller circles and see if we can find the larger circle's radius.**\n\nAssigning Coordinates:\n\n- **Place one circle's center at \\((0, 0)\\), another at \\((2, 0)\\), and the third at \\((1, \\sqrt{3}})\\).**\n\nReflection:\n\n- **This forms an equilateral triangle, as expected.**\n\nCalculating the Larger Circle's Center:\n\n- **The larger circle's center would be at the centroid of this triangle.**\n- **Calculating the centroid:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Centroid} = \\left(\\frac{0 + 2 + 1}{3}, \\frac{0 + 0 + \\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right) = \\left(1, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)\n  \\]\n\nReflection:\n\n- **This aligns with our previous approach, confirming the circumcenter's position.**\n\nCalculating the Radius:\n\n- **The distance from the centroid to any vertex (plus the radius of the smaller circle) should give the larger circle's radius.**\n\nCalculations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nR_{\\text{large}} &= 1 + \\sqrt{1^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^2} \\\\\n&= 1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{3}} \\\\\n&= 1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{3}} \\\\\n&= 1 + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\nR_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\nQuick Check:\n\n- **Both the geometric and coordinate approaches lead to the same result, confirming the correctness of the solution.**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\\[\nR_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\n- **By exploring multiple strategies and reflecting at each step, we ensured the accuracy of our solution.**\n- **Both geometric and coordinate approaches reinforced the correctness of the answer.**\n- **Cross-verifying using different methods is always helpful to build confidence in the solution.**\n\n---\n\n<Complete Solution>\nBy systematically exploring geometric properties, calculating the circumradius, and verifying with coordinate geometry, we've confidently determined that the radius of the larger circle is \\(\\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).\n</Complete Solution>\n\n---\n\n### **Putting It All Together**\n\n<Here's how you'd incorporate the working out into a cohesive solution:>\n\n**Introduction:**\nWe aim to find the radius of a larger circle that is internally tangent to three smaller circles, each with a radius of 1 and externally tangent to each other.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**\n- \nThe centers of the three smaller circles form an equilateral triangle with sides of length 2.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Circumradius**\n- \nThe circumradius of this equilateral triangle represents the distance from the center of the larger circle to the centers of the smaller circles.\n- \nUsing the formula:\n  \n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Larger Circle's Radius**\n- \nAdding the radius of the smaller circles to the circumradius:\n  \n\\[\nR_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3} + 1 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3} + 3}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Verifying with Coordinate Geometry**\n- \nAssigning coordinates to the centers of the smaller circles confirms the circumcenter's position and the larger circle's radius.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n  \n\\[\nR_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThrough geometric analysis and verification, we've accurately determined the radius of the larger circle.\n\n---\n\n<Complete Solution>\nBy carefully examining the geometric relationships between the circles and verifying through multiple methods, we've conclusively found that the radius of the larger circle is \\(\\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).\n</Complete Solution>\n\n---\n\nFeel free to adjust the formatting and flow to match your preferred style.",
