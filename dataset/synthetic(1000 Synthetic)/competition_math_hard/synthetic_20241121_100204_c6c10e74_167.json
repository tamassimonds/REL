I should explore different strategies to see which one fits best.\n\n---\n\n#### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Pigeonhole Principle:**  \n   - Divide the square into smaller parts and see if five points must share a region.\n\n2. **Geometry and Symmetry:**  \n   - Consider the square's properties and possible point arrangements to minimize the maximum distance.\n\n3. **Calculating Maximum Distances:**  \n   - Compute possible distances between points and find the smallest maximum distance that always works.\n\n**Initial Leaning:**  \nThe Pigeonhole Principle seems promising, but I\u2019m not entirely sure yet. Let's explore each strategy briefly.\n\n---\n\n#### **Exploring Strategy 1: Pigeonhole Principle**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- If I divide the square into smaller regions, and I have more points than regions, then at least two points must be in the same region, potentially making their distance small.\n\n**Implementation:**  \n- Let's say we divide the square into smaller squares or triangles. If the total number of regions is less than five, then by placing five points, at least one region contains two points.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBut how should I divide the square? And what should the size of these regions be to ensure the distance between points is \\( \\leq a \\)?\n\n**Attempt:**  \n- Suppose I divide the square into four smaller squares (each with side length 0.5). That gives me four regions.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- Side length of each smaller square = 0.5  \n- Diagonal of each smaller square = \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{0.5^2 + 0.5^2} = \\sqrt{0.5} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.707\n  \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- So, if two points are within the same smaller square, their maximum distance is the diagonal, \n  \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\n**Check:**  \n- Okay, this matches one of the answer choices: \\(\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\sqrt{2}/2\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Wait, but is this the smallest possible \\( a \\)? What if there\u2019s a better way to partition the square or another strategy that yields a smaller \\( a \\)?\n\n**Decision:**  \nThis approach gives us a candidate, but I\u2019m not entirely confident it's the **smallest** possible \\( a \\). Let's explore other strategies to verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Geometry and Symmetry**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Maybe by considering the properties of a square and how points can be arranged, I can find a tighter bound for \\( a \\).\n\n**Implementation:**  \n- Consider dividing the square into more regions or using different shapes like triangles.\n\n**Attempt:**  \n- Let's try dividing the square into six isosceles right triangles by drawing both diagonals and the medians from the center.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- Total regions: 8 (since each diagonal creates four triangles, and adding medians doubles it).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- But wait, that\u2019s more than five regions. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\n**Revised Attempt:**  \n- Instead, let's divide the square into four smaller squares and then split each into two right triangles, making eight triangles in total.\n\n**Total Regions:**  \n- 8 triangles.\n\n**Application of Pigeonhole Principle:**  \n- With five points and eight regions, at least two points must lie within the same triangle.\n\n**Maximum Distance Within a Triangle:**  \n- The longest distance within each triangle would be along its hypotenuse.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- The hypotenuse of each right triangle (half of a smaller square) is \n  \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Again, the maximum distance is \n  \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\n**Check:**  \n- This confirms our previous finding, but still leaves room for doubt whether \n  \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) \n  is the smallest possible \\( a \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Is there a more efficient way to partition the square or another strategy that can reduce \\( a \\) further?\n\n**Decision:**  \nThis approach reinforces the previous result, but let's continue exploring to ensure no better strategy exists.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Calculating Maximum Distances**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Calculate all possible distances between five points and determine the smallest maximum distance that always satisfies the condition.\n\n**Implementation:**  \n- Consider the worst-case scenarios and compute the distances.\n\n**Attempt:**  \n- Let's place points strategically to see the maximum distance.\n\n**Example Placement:**  \n- Place points at the corners of the square and one at the center.\n\n**Distances:**  \n- Diagonals: \n  \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)  \n- Sides: 1  \n- From center to corners: \n  \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\)\n\n**Observation:**  \n- The longest distance here is the diagonal \n  \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), \n  but that\u2019s between corner points.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- But the question asks for the smallest \\( a \\) such that **at least one pair** has a distance \n  \\( \\leq a \\). \n  So, focusing on the smallest such maximum distance.\n\n**Revised Approach:**  \n- Consider different point placements to minimize the maximum distance.\n\n**New Placement Idea:**  \n- What if we place four points at the midpoints of each side and one at the center?\n\n**Distances:**  \n- Midpoints to center: 0.5  \n- Between adjacent midpoints: 1  \n- Between opposite midpoints: \n  \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Here, the smallest distance is 0.5, but larger distances exist.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This suggests that \\( a \\) might be \n  \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\), \n  as earlier found, but again raises the question of whether it's the smallest possible.\n\n**Decision:**  \nCalculating maximum distances in specific arrangements supports the earlier findings but still leaves uncertainty. Let's formalize the approach to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Formalizing Strategy 1: Pigeonhole Principle with Optimal Partitioning**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- To ensure the smallest \\( a \\), I need to partition the square such that any five points must have at least one pair within \\( a \\).\n\n**Implementation:**  \n- Divide the square into regions where the maximum distance within each region is minimized.\n\n**Optimal Partitioning:**  \n- Divide the square into smaller squares or triangles where the maximum internal distance is \\( a \\).\n\n**Attempt:**  \n- Let's divide the square into four smaller squares, each with side length \n  \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- Side length of smaller square \n  \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)  \n- Diagonal of smaller square \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.707\n  \\]\n\n**Application of Pigeonhole Principle:**  \n- With four smaller squares and five points, at least two points must lie within the same smaller square.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Therefore, the maximum distance between these two points is \n  \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\n**Check:**  \n- This aligns with answer choice \n  \\(\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\sqrt{2}/2\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This approach consistently yields \n  \\( a = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\). \n  Given that multiple strategies point to this value, it seems correct.\n\n**Decision:**  \nI\u2019m confident now that \n\\( a = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\) \nis the smallest possible value satisfying the condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Verifying with Strategy 2: Geometry and Symmetry**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- To double-check, let\u2019s consider symmetrical point placements and ensure that no smaller \\( a \\) would satisfy the condition.\n\n**Implementation:**  \n- Place points at strategic locations to test the bound.\n\n**Test Case:**  \n- Place points at the midpoints of the square\u2019s sides and one at the center.\n\n**Distances:**  \n- Midpoints to center: \n  \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)  \n- Between adjacent midpoints: 1  \n- Between opposite midpoints: \n  \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n**Observation:**  \n- The smallest distance here is \n  \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), \n  but larger distances exist between other points.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- However, by ensuring that at least two points lie within the same smaller square, the maximum distance is constrained to \n  \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This test case supports the earlier findings. No smaller \\( a \\) would guarantee the condition for all possible point arrangements.\n\n**Decision:**  \nThis verification reinforces that \n\\( a = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\) \nis indeed the smallest possible value.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thought Process:**  \n- Since multiple strategies and test cases consistently point to \n  \\( a = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\), \n  and no smaller value satisfies the condition for all possible point arrangements, I\u2019m confident that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \n- By systematically exploring different strategies, checking assumptions, and verifying with test cases, I arrived at the correct solution. The Pigeonhole Principle, combined with optimal partitioning of the square, provides a robust method to determine the smallest possible \\( a \\).\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER> \n\n\\(\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\)\n\n\\solution{After exploring various strategies, including the Pigeonhole Principle and calculating maximum distances, I conclude that the smallest possible \\( a \\) is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).

The Pigeonhole Principle, combined with optimal partitioning of the square, provides a robust method to determine the smallest possible \\( a \\). Each step was crucial in confirming the validity of the approach, ensuring that no smaller value could satisfy the condition for all possible arrangements of five points within or on the square.",
  "ground_truth": "Partition the unit square into four smaller squares of sidelength $\\frac{1}{2}$. Each of the five points lies in one of these squares, and so by the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists two points in the same $\\frac{1}{2}\\times \\frac{1}{2}$ square - the maximum possible distance between them being $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}$ by Pythagoras."
