  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, checking my work along the way, and adjusting my strategy as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- **What am I dealing with here?** It's a function with multiple terms involving fractions where the denominators are polynomials of \\( x \\).\n  \n- **What's being asked?** I need to find the domain, which means identifying all the \\( x \\)-values for which the function \\( j(x) \\) is defined.\n\nBrainstorming:\n- **Denominators Can't Be Zero:** My initial thought is that since we have fractions, the function will be undefined wherever any of the denominators are zero.\n  \n- **Multiple Denominators:** There are three different denominators: \\( x + 8 \\), \\( x^2 + 8 \\), and \\( x^3 + 8 \\). I need to consider each one separately.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:** I could find the roots of each denominator and exclude those from the domain. Alternatively, I might look for common factors, but at first glance, they seem distinct.\n\nWait a minute...\n- **Do they share common roots?** Not immediately obvious, so I might need to explore that.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Find the Roots of Each Denominator Separately**\n\n#### **Step 1: Find Roots of Each Denominator**\n\n- **Denominator 1:** \\( x + 8 = 0 \\)\n  - **Solving:** \\( x = -8 \\)\n  - **Thought:** Simple linear equation, so \\( x = -8 \\) makes the first term undefined.\n\n- **Denominator 2:** \\( x^2 + 8 = 0 \\)\n  - **Solving:** \\( x^2 = -8 \\) \u21d2 \\( x = \\pm\\sqrt{-8} = \\pm2i\\sqrt{2} \\)\n  - **Reflection:** These roots are complex, meaning they don't affect the real domain. So, no real \\( x \\)-values make this denominator zero.\n\n- **Denominator 3:** \\( x^3 + 8 = 0 \\)\n  - **Solving:** \\( x^3 = -8 \\) \u21d2 \\( x = -2 \\)\n  - **Thought:** This gives a real root at \\( x = -2 \\).\n\n#### **Initial Check**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\) are the real numbers where the denominators become zero.\n  \n- **Complex Roots:** Since \\( x^2 + 8 \\) only has complex roots, it doesn't restrict the real domain.\n\n**Strategy 2: Consider the Function as a Whole**\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Instead of looking at each term separately, think about where the entire function is undefined.\n  \n- **But wait...** Each term is independent, so it's still valid to consider denominators individually.\n\n#### **Conclusion from Strategy 1**\n\n- **Final Conclusion:** Stick with Strategy 1 as it seems straightforward and effective. By identifying the real roots where the denominators are zero, I've pinpointed where the function is undefined.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **At \\( x = -8 \\):** \n  \n  - First term: \\( \\frac{1}{-8 + 8} = \\frac{1}{0} \\) \u21d2 Undefined\n  \n  - **Thought:** Yep, makes sense to exclude \\( x = -8 \\).\n\n- **At \\( x = -2 \\):**\n  \n  - Third term: \\( \\frac{1}{(-2)^3 + 8} = \\frac{1}{-8 + 8} = \\frac{1}{0} \\) \u21d2 Undefined\n  \n  - **Reflection:** Correct to exclude \\( x = -2 \\).\n\n**Additional Check:**\n\n- **Does this cover everything?** Given that the other denominator \\( x^2 + 8 \\) only has complex roots, no additional real exclusions are necessary.\n\n- **Is the approach solid?** Yes, by identifying the real roots where the denominators are zero, I've accurately determined the problematic points.\n\n---\n\n### **Expressing the Domain as a Union of Intervals**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **How do I represent this?** I need to express the domain excluding \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\).\n\n- **Use Interval Notation:** This is the standard way to represent domains with exclusions.\n\n**Writing the Domain:**\n\n- From negative infinity to \\( -8 \\): \\( (-\\infty, -8) \\)\n  \n- Between \\( -8 \\) and \\( -2 \\): \\( (-8, -2) \\)\n  \n- From \\( -2 \\) to positive infinity: \\( (-2, \\infty) \\)\n\n**Combining Intervals:**\n\n- **Final Representation:** \n  \n  \\[\n  (-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, -2) \\cup (-2, \\infty)\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does this cover all real numbers except \\( -8 \\) and \\( -2 \\)?** Yes, the union of these intervals excludes exactly those points.\n\n**Final Verification:**\n\n- **Any other issues?** No, all real points where the function is undefined are excluded.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\nThe domain of the function \n\n\\[\nj(x) = \\frac{1}{x+8} + \\frac{1}{x^2+8} + \\frac{1}{x^3+8}\n\\]\n\nis:\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, -2) \\cup (-2, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- By identifying the real roots of the denominators where the function becomes undefined, we successfully determined the domain as the union of intervals excluding \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Does the solution make sense?** Yes, all steps logically lead to excluding the points where the function is undefined.\n\n- **Did I consider all possibilities?** Yes, both real and complex roots were examined, ensuring a complete understanding of the domain.\n\n- **Is the interval notation correctly applied?** Absolutely, the domain is neatly expressed, excluding only the problematic points.\n\n**Overall, by methodically exploring different strategies, checking each step, and reflecting throughout the process, I've arrived at a correct and complete solution.**\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Exploring Common Factors**\n\n**Thinking Differently:**\n\n- **Do the denominators share common factors?** At first glance, \\( x + 8 \\), \\( x^2 + 8 \\), and \\( x^3 + 8 \\) seem distinct, but let's explore if there's a deeper connection.\n\n**Investigating Common Roots:**\n\n- **Is \\( x = -8 \\) a root for all denominators?**\n  \n  - **For \\( x + 8 \\):** \n  \n    - \\( (-8) + 8 = 0 \\) \u21d2 Yes, \\( x = -8 \\) is a root.\n  \n  - **For \\( x^2 + 8 \\):**\n    \n    - \\( (-8)^2 + 8 = 64 + 8 = 72 \\neq 0 \\) \u21d2 No, \\( x = -8 \\) is not a root.\n    \n  - **For \\( x^3 + 8 \\):**\n    \n    - \\( (-8)^3 + 8 = -512 + 8 = -504 \\neq 0 \\) \u21d2 No, \\( x = -8 \\) is not a root.\n    \n- **Is \\( x = -2 \\) a root for all denominators?**\n  \n  - **For \\( x + 8 \\):** \n  \n    - \\( (-2) + 8 = 6 \\neq 0 \\) \u21d2 No, \\( x = -2 \\) is not a root.\n  \n  - **For \\( x^2 + 8 \\):**\n    \n    - \\( (-2)^2 + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12 \\neq 0 \\) \u21d2 No, \\( x = -2 \\) is not a root.\n    \n  - **For \\( x^3 + 8 \\):**\n    \n    - \\( (-2)^3 + 8 = -8 + 8 = 0 \\) \u21d2 Yes, \\( x = -2 \\) is a root.\n    \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this change anything?** Not really, because the real roots we've identified (\\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\)) already account for where the function is undefined. The absence of additional common factors means no extra exclusions are necessary.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Is the original strategy still valid?** Yes, identifying the real roots of the individual denominators remains the most straightforward and effective approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Concluding the Solution**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Is the approach correct?** Absolutely, by systematically identifying the real roots where the denominators are zero, the domain has been accurately determined.\n\n- **Have all possibilities been considered?** Yes, both real and complex roots were analyzed, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the domain.\n\n- **Is the interval notation applied correctly?** Yes, the domain is clearly expressed, excluding only the points where the function is undefined.\n\n**Final Answer Recap:**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\nThe domain of the function \n\n\\[\nj(x) = \\frac{1}{x+8} + \\frac{1}{x^2+8} + \\frac{1}{x^3+8}\n\\]\n\nis:\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, -2) \\cup (-2, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- By methodically exploring different strategies, checking each step, and reflecting throughout the process, the correct domain has been determined as the union of intervals excluding \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Does the solution make sense?** Yes, all steps logically lead to excluding the points where the function is undefined.\n\n- **Did I consider all possibilities?** Yes, both real and complex roots were examined, ensuring a complete understanding of the domain.\n\n- **Is the interval notation correctly applied?** Absolutely, the domain is neatly expressed, excluding only the problematic points.\n\n**Overall, by methodically exploring different strategies, checking each step, and reflecting throughout the process, I've arrived at a correct and complete solution.**\n\n---",
  "ground_truth": "We note that $j(x)$ is defined unless one or more of the denominators $x+8,~x^2+8,~x^3+8$ is equal to $0$.\n\nWe have $x+8=0$ if $x=-8$, and $x^3+8$ if $x=\\sqrt[3]{-8} = -2$. There is no real $x$ for which $x^2+8=0$. Therefore, the domain of $j(x)$ consists of all real $x$ except $-8$ and $-2$. As a union of intervals, this is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-8)\\cup (-8,-2)\\cup (-2,\\infty)}$."
