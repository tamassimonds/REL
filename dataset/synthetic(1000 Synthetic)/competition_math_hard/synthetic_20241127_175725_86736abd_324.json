  "problem": "The infinite sequence $S=\\{s_1,s_2,s_3,\\ldots\\}$ is defined by $s_1=7$ and $s_n=7^{s_{n-1}}$ for each integer $n>1$. What is the remainder when $s_{100}$ is divided by $5$?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, complete with brainstorming, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, it looks like it's dealing with an infinite sequence where each term depends exponentially on the previous one. The goal is to find the remainder of \\( s_{100} \\) when divided by 5.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis reminds me of problems involving modular arithmetic, especially since we're looking for remainders. I've dealt with similar sequences before where patterns emerge in the remainders. But honestly, dealing with such high exponents can be tricky, so I need to brainstorm different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Calculation:**  \n   Calculate each term up to \\( s_{100} \\) and find the remainder.  \n   *Wait, that can't be right because...* computing \\( 7^{7^{7^{\\cdots}}} \\) up to 100 terms is impractical.\n\n2. **Modular Patterns:**  \n   Look for patterns in the remainders of powers of 7 modulo 5.  \n   *This reminds me of...* Euler's theorem or Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\n3. **Exponent Simplification:**  \n   Simplify the exponent using modular reduction to make calculations feasible.  \n   *Hmm, maybe I need to back up and...* ensure that the exponent itself is reduced modulo 4 (since \\( 5-1 = 4 \\)).\n\n**Settling on Strategy:**  \nI think exploring the **Modular Patterns** is the most efficient way. I\u2019ll start by examining how powers of 7 behave modulo 5 and see if a repeating pattern emerges.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Modular Patterns**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate \\( 7^n \\mod 5 \\) for Small \\( n \\)**\n\nLet's compute the first few powers of 7 modulo 5 to see if there's a pattern.\n\n- \\( 7^1 \\equiv 2 \\mod 5 \\)  \n  *Quick Check:* \\( 7 - 5 = 2 \\) \u2014 That works.\n  \n- \\( 7^2 = 49 \\equiv 4 \\mod 5 \\)  \n  *Double Check:* \\( 49 - 45 = 4 \\) \u2014 Okay.\n  \n- \\( 7^3 = 343 \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\)  \n  *Reflection:* \\( 343 - 340 = 3 \\) \u2014 Still good.\n  \n- \\( 7^4 = 2401 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5 \\)  \n  *Aha Moment:* \\( 2401 - 2400 = 1 \\) \u2014 Wait a minute, this is interesting.\n\n**Observation:**  \nI see that after \\( 7^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5 \\), the powers repeat:\n- \\( 7^5 \\equiv 7^1 \\equiv 2 \\mod 5 \\) \n- And so on...\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere's a **cycle of length 4** in the remainders: 2, 4, 3, 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying the Cycle to \\( s_{100} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince \\( s_{100} = 7^{s_{99}} \\), and we know that powers of 7 repeat every 4 modulo 5, I can use this cyclic pattern to simplify the problem.\n\n**Wait, but...**  \nI need to ensure that the exponent \\( s_{99} \\) aligns with this cycle. This means I should determine \\( s_{99} \\mod 4 \\) because the cycle repeats every 4.\n\n---\n\n### **Reducing the Exponent modulo 4**\n\n**Strategy:**  \nFind \\( s_{99} \\mod 4 \\) to identify which power of 7\u2019s remainder applies to \\( s_{100} \\).\n\n**Step 1: Determining \\( s_{99} \\mod 4 \\)**\n\nI realize that I need to trace back through the sequence to find how each term behaves modulo 4.\n\n**But that seems...**  \nIt could get complicated to manually compute each term up to \\( s_{99} \\). Maybe there's a better way to handle this by observing patterns early on.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nPerhaps I can notice that because \\( s_n = 7^{s_{n-1}} \\), and 7 itself has specific properties modulo 4 and 5, the sequence might stabilize in terms of remainders.\n\n**Let\u2019s try it out.**\n\n---\n\n### **Simplifying the Sequence Using Modular Arithmetic**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf I can establish that after a certain point, all \\( s_n \\) have the same remainder modulo 4 or 5, it simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n**Step 1: Compute Initial Terms modulo 4 and 5**\n\nLet\u2019s compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n**Compute \\( s_1 \\):**  \n\\( s_1 = 7 \\)\n\n- \\( s_1 \\mod 4 = 7 \\mod 4 = 3 \\)\n- \\( s_1 \\mod 5 = 7 \\mod 5 = 2 \\)\n\n**Compute \\( s_2 = 7^{s_1} = 7^7 \\):**  \nBut instead of calculating \\( 7^7 \\) directly, let's find it modulo 4 and 5.\n\n**Modulo 4 Calculation:**  \n- Recall: \\( 7 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\)\n- So, \\( 7^7 \\equiv 3^7 \\mod 4 \\)\n\n**Wait, let\u2019s simplify:**  \n- \\( 3^1 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\)\n- \\( 3^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\)\n- Therefore, \\( 3^7 = (3^2)^3 \\times 3 \\equiv 1^3 \\times 3 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\)\n\n**Modulo 5 Calculation:**  \n- From earlier, \\( 7^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5 \\)\n- So, \\( 7^7 = 7^4 \\times 7^3 \\equiv 1 \\times 7^3 \\equiv 7^3 \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\)\n\n**Summary for \\( s_2 \\):**  \n- \\( s_2 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\)\n- \\( s_2 \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\) \n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth modulo 4 and 5, \\( s_2 \\) yields a remainder of 3. Interesting! Let\u2019s proceed to \\( s_3 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Continuing the Pattern**\n\n**Compute \\( s_3 = 7^{s_2} = 7^3 \\):**  \nBut again, let\u2019s find it modulo 4 and 5.\n\n**Modulo 4 Calculation:**  \n- \\( 7 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\)\n- \\( 7^3 \\equiv 3^3 \\equiv 27 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\) \n\n**Modulo 5 Calculation:**  \n- From earlier, \\( 7^3 \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\)\n\n**Summary for \\( s_3 \\):**  \n- \\( s_3 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\)\n- \\( s_3 \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\) \n\n**Observation:**  \nIt seems like \\( s_n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\) and \\( s_n \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\). \n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this pattern hold for \\( s_4 \\)?\n\n**Compute \\( s_4 = 7^{s_3} = 7^3 \\):**  \nWe already know from above:\n- \\( s_4 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\)\n- \\( s_4 \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\) \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe pattern stabilizes: \\( s_n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\) and \\( s_n \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\) for all \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nThis consistent remainder simplifies our problem significantly. Now, I can confidently apply this to \\( s_{100} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\n**Determine \\( s_{100} \\mod 5 \\):**  \nGiven our established pattern:\n\n- \\( s_{100} \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\)\n\n**But wait...**  \nLet\u2019s double-check whether this makes sense. Since all \\( s_n \\) from \\( n \\geq 2 \\) have a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, \\( s_{100} \\) should indeed follow this pattern.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nThink about it \u2014 each term feeds into the next, but since the remainder stabilizes early on, there\u2019s no deviation.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\n**<ANSWER> 3</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough exploring different strategies, I realized that directly calculating high powers was impractical. By identifying and confirming a repeating pattern in the remainders, I simplified the problem significantly. Regular checks and validations ensured that the approach was correct, leading to a confident final answer.\n\n**<ANSWER> solution By identifying the repeating pattern in the remainders of powers of 7 modulo 5 and confirming that the sequence stabilizes early on, we determined that \\( s_{100} \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\). </ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nBreaking down complex sequences into manageable patterns and validating assumptions at each step is crucial in problem-solving, especially in modular arithmetic.",
  "ground_truth": "Another way of writing the sequence $S$ is $\\{7,7^7,7^{7^7},7^{7^{7^7}},\\ldots\\}$. We wish to determine the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term of this sequence modulo $5$.\n\nNote that $s_{100} = 7^{s_{99}}\\equiv 2^{s_{99}}\\pmod 5$. In order to determine the remainder of $2^{s_{99}}$ when divided by $5$, we look for a pattern in the powers of $2$ modulo $5$. Computing a few powers of $2$ yields \\[\\{2^0,2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4,\\ldots\\}\\equiv \\{1,2,4,3,1,\\ldots\\}\\pmod 5.\\]So we have a cyclic pattern $1,2,4,3$ of length $4$ (this is called a period). Now we need to determine where $2^{s_{99}}$ falls in the cycle; to do that, we must determine the residue of $s_{99}\\pmod 4$, since the cycle has length $4$.\n\nNote that \\begin{align*}\n7&\\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\\n7^7&\\equiv (-1)^7 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\\n7^{7^7}&\\equiv (-1)^{7^7}\\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}Continuing in this manner, we always have $s_n \\equiv 3\\pmod 4$. Thus, $s_{100} = 2^{s_{99}} \\equiv 2^3 \\equiv \\boxed{3}\\pmod 5$."
