  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem step by step, embracing a natural human thought process. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect frequently, and check for correctness along the way. If something doesn't work, I'll pivot and try a new approach, just like how a human would naturally solve a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, looking at the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} + \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis reminds me of nested square roots problems I've encountered before. The presence of constants like \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\) suggests that perfect squares or familiar identities might be involved. But honestly, it looks a bit intimidating at first glance. I'm not entirely sure where to start.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Assign Variables:**  \n   Maybe let\u2019s set each square root expression equal to something simpler and see if that helps.\n\n2. **Square Both Sides:**  \n   Squaring might eliminate the square roots, making the equation easier to handle.\n\n3. **Look for Patterns:**  \n   Perhaps recognize familiar Pythagorean triples or algebraic identities.\n\n4. **Substitution:**  \n   Introduce a substitution to simplify the nested roots.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAssigning variables or substitution could complicate things further. Squaring both sides seems like a promising approach, but I need to be careful about extraneous solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Square Both Sides**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s try squaring both sides to eliminate the outer square roots. This usually helps in simplifying such equations.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} + \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}}\\right)^2 = \\left(2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}}\\right)^2 + 2 \\times \\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} \\times \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}} + \\left(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}}\\right)^2 = 4 + 8 + 8\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n4 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c} + 2\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} \\times \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}} + 2 + \\sqrt{2+c} = 12 + 8\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nPutting it together:\n\n\\[\n6 + \\sqrt{8 + 4c} + \\sqrt{2 + c} + 2\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} \\times \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}} = 12 + 8\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, this doesn't look any simpler. In fact, it seems more complicated now with the cross terms involving square roots multiplying each other. Maybe squaring both sides wasn't the best idea initially.\n\n**Realization:**  \nWait, that can't be right because it's introducing more complexity instead of simplifying. Let me back up and try a different approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Another Strategy \u2013 Assigning Variables**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nPerhaps assigning each square root to a variable might help in breaking down the problem.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}}\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nx + y = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow we have two variables, but we need to express them in terms of \\(c\\). This might still be useful, but I need to find relationships between \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n**Next Step:**  \nLet's express \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) squared:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 4+\\sqrt{8+4c}\n\\]\n\\[\ny^2 = 2+\\sqrt{2+c}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf I can isolate \\(c\\) in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), it might lead me somewhere.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Attempting to Isolate \\(c\\)**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFrom \\(x^2\\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4 = \\sqrt{8+4c}\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides again:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 4)^2 = 8 + 4c\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n4c = (x^2 - 4)^2 - 8\n\\]\n\\[\nc = \\frac{1}{4}((x^2 - 4)^2 - 8)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis expression for \\(c\\) depends on \\(x\\). I need a similar expression involving \\(y\\) to find a relationship.\n\nFrom \\(y^2\\):\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 2 = \\sqrt{2+c}\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\n(y^2 - 2)^2 = 2 + c\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nc = (y^2 - 2)^2 - 2\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow I have two expressions for \\(c\\):\n\n\\[\nc = \\frac{1}{4}((x^2 - 4)^2 - 8)\n\\]\n\\[\nc = (y^2 - 2)^2 - 2\n\\]\n\n**Next Step:**  \nSet the two expressions equal to each other to find a relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4}((x^2 - 4)^2 - 8) = (y^2 - 2)^2 - 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis equation still looks quite complicated. Solving it might be messy and doesn't seem to lead to an obvious solution. Perhaps there's a better way.\n\n**Realization:**  \nMaybe assigning variables wasn't the most efficient path. Let's try a different approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Looking for Patterns or Familiar Identities**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe right side of the equation is \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\), which reminds me of expressions involving square roots that can be simplified using known identities. Perhaps the left side can be rewritten in terms of perfect squares.\n\n**Exploring Patterns:**\n\n1. **Perfect Squares:**  \n   Maybe each square root expression equals a sum involving \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n2. **Pythagorean Triples:**  \n   Although less likely, checking if these values relate to known triples.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nFocusing on perfect squares seems more promising. Let\u2019s explore that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Assuming Perfect Squares for Each Term**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s assume that each square root expression equals a specific value that, when squared, matches the right side.\n\nSuppose:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} = A\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}} = B\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nA + B = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Assumption:**  \nLet\u2019s assume \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are of the form \\(m + n\\sqrt{2}\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are rational numbers.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis approach might work if we can find \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) such that their sum equals \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Determining \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSuppose:\n\n\\[\nA = 2 + \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nB = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\nA + B = (2 + \\sqrt{2}) + \\sqrt{2} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis satisfies the right side of the equation. Now, let's see if these assignments satisfy the original square root expressions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying Assignments**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFirst term:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} = 2 + \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\n4+\\sqrt{8+4c} = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2\n\\]\n\\[\n4+\\sqrt{8+4c} = 4 + 4\\sqrt{2} + 2 = 6 + 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{8+4c} = 6 + 4\\sqrt{2} - 4 = 2 + 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSquare again:\n\n\\[\n8 + 4c = (2 + 4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + 16\\sqrt{2} + 32 = 36 + 16\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n4c = 28 + 16\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nc = 7 + 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute, let's see if this value of \\(c\\) satisfies the second square root expression.\n\nSecond term:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\n2+\\sqrt{2+c} = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2+c} = 0\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n2 + c = 0 \\implies c = -2\n\\]\n\n**Realization:**  \nThere's a contradiction here! The first term suggests \\(c = 7 + 4\\sqrt{2}\\), but the second term suggests \\(c = -2\\). This means that my initial assumption about \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) was incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAssigning perfect squares in this manner doesn't work because it leads to inconsistent values for \\(c\\). I need to try a different approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Re-evaluating the Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince assigning specific values to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) didn't work, perhaps I need to consider that both square root expressions are equal to each other. Maybe the equation can be balanced by setting the two terms on the left side to be equal.\n\n**New Strategy:**  \nSuppose:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} = \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIf both terms are equal, their sum would be \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\). Let's see if this assumption holds.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Assuming Equality of Both Terms**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nAssume:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} = \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}}\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\n4+\\sqrt{8+4c} = 2+\\sqrt{2+c}\n\\]\n\nRearrange:\n\n\\[\n2+\\sqrt{8+4c} = \\sqrt{2+c}\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides again:\n\n\\[\n(2+\\sqrt{8+4c})^2 = 2+c\n\\]\n\\[\n4 + 4\\sqrt{8+4c} + (8 + 4c) = 2 + c\n\\]\n\\[\n16 + 4\\sqrt{8+4c} + 4c = 2 + c\n\\]\n\\[\n14 + 4\\sqrt{8+4c} + 4c = c\n\\]\n\\[\n14 + 4\\sqrt{8+4c} + 4c - c = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n14 + 4\\sqrt{8+4c} + 3c = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis still looks complicated. However, if I can isolate the square root term, it might lead me to a solution.\n\n**Next Step:**  \nLet's isolate \\(\\sqrt{8+4c}\\).\n\n\\[\n4\\sqrt{8+4c} = -14 - 3c\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{8+4c} = \\frac{-14 - 3c}{4}\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\[\n8 + 4c = \\left(\\frac{-14 - 3c}{4}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n8 + 4c = \\frac{196 + 84c + 9c^2}{16}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 16 to clear the denominator:\n\n\\[\n128 + 64c = 196 + 84c + 9c^2\n\\]\n\nRearrange all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n9c^2 + 84c + 196 - 64c - 128 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n9c^2 + 20c + 68 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow, I have a quadratic equation. Solving this for \\(c\\) might give me the value I need. But let\u2019s take a moment to see if this makes sense.\n\n**Check:**  \nQuadratic equations can have two solutions, and given the nature of the original problem, one of them might be extraneous (an artifact of squaring both sides). So, I\u2019ll need to verify the solutions afterward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s use the quadratic formula to solve for \\(c\\).\n\nThe quadratic equation is:\n\n\\[\n9c^2 + 20c + 68 = 0\n\\]\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\nc = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(a = 9\\)\n- \\(b = 20\\)\n- \\(c = 68\\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nc = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{20^2 - 4 \\times 9 \\times 68}}{2 \\times 9}\n\\]\n\\[\nc = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 - 2448}}{18}\n\\]\n\\[\nc = \\frac{-20 \\pm \\sqrt{-2048}}{18}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a second, the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\)) is negative (\\(-2048\\)), which means that the quadratic equation has no real solutions. This can't be correct since we're dealing with real numbers in the original problem.\n\n**Realization:**  \nThis indicates that assuming the two square root expressions are equal is incorrect. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAnother dead end. Time to rethink the strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 11: Reconsidering the Approach \u2013 Direct Substitution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nPerhaps instead of trying to equate the two square root expressions or assigning them specific values, I can try to find a relationship by substituting possible values for \\(c\\) that simplify the equation.\n\n**New Strategy:**  \nLet\u2019s assume \\(c\\) is a value that makes the inner square roots perfect squares, thereby simplifying the expression.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis might seem like guesswork, but sometimes substituting plausible values can lead to a correct solution, especially when dealing with nested square roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 12: Making an Educated Guess**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLooking at the nested square roots, I notice that if \\(c\\) is chosen such that \\(8 + 4c\\) and \\(2 + c\\) are perfect squares, the square roots will simplify nicely.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s find \\(c\\) such that:\n\n\\[\n8 + 4c = n^2 \\quad \\text{for some integer } n\n\\]\n\\[\n2 + c = m^2 \\quad \\text{for some integer } m\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(c\\):**\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n\\[\nc = m^2 - 2\n\\]\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\n\\[\n8 + 4(m^2 - 2) = n^2\n\\]\n\\[\n8 + 4m^2 - 8 = n^2\n\\]\n\\[\n4m^2 = n^2\n\\]\n\\[\nm = \\frac{n}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis implies that \\(m\\) must be half of \\(n\\), meaning \\(n\\) must be even. Let's choose appropriate integer values for \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).\n\n**Choice:**  \nLet\u2019s take \\(n = 2\\), so \\(m = 1\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nm = 1 \\implies c = 1^2 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nLet\u2019s substitute \\(c = -1\\) back into the original equation and see if it satisfies it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 13: Verifying the Guess**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubstitute \\(c = -1\\) into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4(-1)}} + \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+(-1)}} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8-4}} + \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{1}} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{4}} + \\sqrt{2+1} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4+2} + \\sqrt{3} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{3} \\neq 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe left side simplifies to \\(\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{3}\\), which does not equal \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\). Therefore, \\(c = -1\\) is not a valid solution.\n\n**Realization:**  \nAlthough \\(c = -1\\) made the inner square roots perfect squares, it doesn't satisfy the original equation. This suggests that perhaps another value for \\(c\\) needs to be considered, or a different approach is necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe guess didn't work. Time to pivot and try something else.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 14: Returning to the Original Equation with a New Perspective**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nInstead of making guesses, perhaps there's a more systematic way to approach this problem by carefully analyzing the structure of the equation and simplifying step by step.\n\n**New Strategy:**  \nLet's focus on simplifying each square root expression individually and see if that leads us to the solution.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis might require more algebraic manipulation, but it's worth trying.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 15: Simplifying Each Square Root Expression**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's look at the first term:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nPerhaps I can express the inner square root in terms of \\(c\\) and see if it simplifies naturally.\n\n**Rewriting:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} = \\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{4(2+c)}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNot much simplification observed here. Let's attempt to square both sides again, but this time focusing on one term at a time.\n\n**Next Step:**  \nSquare both sides of the original equation separately to deal with each term.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 16: Squaring Both Sides Separately**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} + \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} + \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}}\\right)^2 = (2 + 2\\sqrt{2})^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side:\n\n\\[\n(4+\\sqrt{8+4c}) + 2\\sqrt{(4+\\sqrt{8+4c})(2+\\sqrt{2+c})} + (2+\\sqrt{2+c})\n\\]\n\\[\n= 6 + \\sqrt{8+4c} + \\sqrt{2+c} + 2\\sqrt{(4+\\sqrt{8+4c})(2+\\sqrt{2+c})}\n\\]\n\nRight side:\n\n\\[\n4 + 8 + 8\\sqrt{2} = 12 + 8\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n6 + \\sqrt{8+4c} + \\sqrt{2+c} + 2\\sqrt{(4+\\sqrt{8+4c})(2+\\sqrt{2+c})} = 12 + 8\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{8+4c} + \\sqrt{2+c} + 2\\sqrt{(4+\\sqrt{8+4c})(2+\\sqrt{2+c})} = 6 + 8\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis still looks messy. However, perhaps I can isolate one of the square root terms and see if that leads to simplification.\n\n**Next Step:**  \nLet's isolate \\(\\sqrt{8+4c}\\) and see if that helps.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 17: Isolating \\(\\sqrt{8+4c}\\)**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nRearrange the equation to isolate \\(\\sqrt{8+4c}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{8+4c} + \\sqrt{2+c} = 6 + 8\\sqrt{2} - 2\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} \\times \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{8+4c} = 6 + 8\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{2+c} - 2\\sqrt{4+\\sqrt{8+4c}} \\times \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2+c}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis doesn't seem to simplify nicely. In fact, it looks more complicated than before. Maybe isolating \\(\\sqrt{8+4c}\\) isn't the right move.\n\n**Realization:**  \nPerhaps a different approach is necessary. Let me think about other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 18: Attempting a Substitution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nMaybe introducing a substitution to simplify the nested square roots can help.\n\n**New Strategy:**  \nLet\u2019s set \\(t = \\sqrt{8 + 4c}\\). This might simplify the equation.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBy substituting, I can express other parts of the equation in terms of \\(t\\) and \\(c\\), potentially making it easier to solve.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 19: Implementing the Substitution**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n\n\\[\nt = \\sqrt{8 + 4c}\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4 + t} + \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + c}} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to express \\(c\\) in terms of \\(t\\). From the substitution:\n\n\\[\nt^2 = 8 + 4c \\implies c = \\frac{t^2 - 8}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis substitution seems to help by reducing one layer of complexity. Let\u2019s proceed with this and see if it leads to a solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 20: Rewriting the Equation in Terms of \\(t\\)**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubstitute \\(c = \\frac{t^2 - 8}{4}\\) into the second square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2 + \\frac{t^2 - 8}{4}}}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the inner expression:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{\\frac{8 + t^2 - 8}{4}}} = \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{\\frac{t^2}{4}}} = \\sqrt{2 + \\frac{t}{2}}\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4 + t} + \\sqrt{2 + \\frac{t}{2}} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks more manageable. Now, let's try to eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides again.\n\n**Next Step:**  \nSquare both sides to simplify the equation further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 21: Squaring Both Sides Again**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\sqrt{4 + t} + \\sqrt{2 + \\frac{t}{2}}\\right)^2 = \\left(2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side:\n\n\\[\n(4 + t) + 2\\sqrt{(4 + t)\\left(2 + \\frac{t}{2}\\right)} + \\left(2 + \\frac{t}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n4 + t + 2 + \\frac{t}{2} + 2\\sqrt{(4 + t)\\left(2 + \\frac{t}{2}\\right)} = 6 + \\frac{3t}{2} + 2\\sqrt{(4 + t)\\left(2 + \\frac{t}{2}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nRight side:\n\n\\[\n4 + 8 + 8\\sqrt{2} = 12 + 8\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n6 + \\frac{3t}{2} + 2\\sqrt{(4 + t)\\left(2 + \\frac{t}{2}\\right)} = 12 + 8\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis still looks complicated, but perhaps isolating the square root term will lead to simplification.\n\n**Next Step:**  \nIsolate the square root term and square both sides again to eliminate it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 22: Isolating the Square Root Term**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubtract \\(6 + \\frac{3t}{2}\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{(4 + t)\\left(2 + \\frac{t}{2}\\right)} = 12 + 8\\sqrt{2} - 6 - \\frac{3t}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{(4 + t)\\left(2 + \\frac{t}{2}\\right)} = 6 + 8\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{3t}{2}\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(4 + t)\\left(2 + \\frac{t}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{6 + 8\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{3t}{2}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(4 + t)\\left(2 + \\frac{t}{2}\\right)} = 3 + 4\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{3t}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow, I can square both sides again to eliminate the remaining square root. Let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 23: Squaring Both Sides Again**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\n(4 + t)\\left(2 + \\frac{t}{2}\\right) = \\left(3 + 4\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{3t}{4}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nLeft side:\n\n\\[\n(4 + t)\\left(2 + \\frac{t}{2}\\right) = 8 + 2t + \\frac{4t}{2} + \\frac{t^2}{2} = 8 + 3t + \\frac{t^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nRight side:\n\n\\[\n\\left(3 + 4\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{3t}{4}\\right)^2 = 9 + 24\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{18t}{4} + 32 - \\frac{24t}{4} + \\frac{9t^2}{16}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 41 + 24\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{42t}{4} + \\frac{9t^2}{16}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 41 + 24\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{21t}{2} + \\frac{9t^2}{16}\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n8 + 3t + \\frac{t^2}{2} = 41 + 24\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{21t}{2} + \\frac{9t^2}{16}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis equation still looks quite messy, and solving for \\(t\\) might be complicated.
