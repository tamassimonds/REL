  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking through it just like I would if I were tackling it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the question is asking at the end of which month McGwire and Sosa were tied in total home runs during the 1998 baseball season. Hmm... It sounds like I need to track their home runs month by month and identify when their totals matched.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Maybe I can add up their home runs cumulatively month by month and see where their totals align.\n- **Strategy 2:** Alternatively, I could look for patterns or differences in their monthly home runs to spot a tie.\n\nHonestly, adding up the totals seems straightforward, but I\u2019ll keep an open mind in case there's a more efficient way.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies: Starting with Cumulative Totals**\n\nLet\u2019s try the first strategy\u2014calculating cumulative totals for each player month by month.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, I need the exact numbers from the graph to proceed. Oh! I missed that. Let me list them out first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Extracting Data from the Graph**\n\nLooking at the graph, here are the home runs for each month:\n\n#### **McGwire:**\n- **March (Mar):** 1\n- **April (Apr):** 10\n- **May (May):** 16\n- **June (Jun):** 10\n- **July (Jul):** 8\n- **August (Aug):** 10\n- **September (Sep):** 15\n\n#### **Sosa:**\n- **April (Apr):** 6\n- **May (May):** 7\n- **June (Jun):** 20\n- **July (Jul):** 9\n- **August (Aug):** 13\n- **September (Sep):** 11\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **March:** Only McGwire has home runs.\n- **April to September:** Both players have recorded home runs.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Cumulative Totals**\n\nLet\u2019s add up the home runs month by month for both players to see when their totals match.\n\n#### **McGwire\u2019s Cumulative Totals:**\n- **March:** 1\n- **April:** 1 + 10 = 11\n- **May:** 11 + 16 = 27\n- **June:** 27 + 10 = 37\n- **July:** 37 + 8 = 45\n- **August:** 45 + 10 = 55\n- **September:** 55 + 15 = 70\n\n#### **Sosa\u2019s Cumulative Totals:**\n- **March:** 0 (Didn\u2019t play)\n- **April:** 6\n- **May:** 6 + 7 = 13\n- **June:** 13 + 20 = 33\n- **July:** 33 + 9 = 42\n- **August:** 42 + 13 = 55\n- **September:** 55 + 11 = 66\n\n**Checking Work:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Do the totals make sense? Yes, both end with realistic season totals (McGwire: 70, Sosa: 66).\n- **Reflection:** So far, so good. But wait, I don\u2019t see a tie here. Let\u2019s dig deeper.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying the Tie Point**\n\nHmm, looking at the cumulative totals, there\u2019s no exact month where their totals are identical. This is puzzling.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Maybe I Need a Different Approach:** Perhaps I need to consider partial months or look for points within a month where their totals aligned.\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Calculate the exact point within a month where their cumulative totals would tie.\n\nOof, this might get tricky, but let's give it a shot.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating Partial Months**\n\nLet\u2019s see if during a particular month, the players' totals would have matched.\n\n**Ideas:**\n\n- **Find the Difference:** Calculate the difference in their totals at the end of each month.\n- **Determine When the Difference is Zero:** See if at any point within a month, their cumulative totals would be equal.\n\n**Executing the Idea:**\n\n#### **End of Each Month Differences:**\n- **April:** McGwire 11 - Sosa 6 = 5\n- **May:** McGwire 27 - Sosa 13 = 14\n- **June:** McGwire 37 - Sosa 33 = 4\n- **July:** McGwire 45 - Sosa 42 = 3\n- **August:** McGwire 55 - Sosa 55 = 0\n- **September:** McGwire 70 - Sosa 66 = 4\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **End of August:** Ah! The difference is zero. That means at the end of August, their cumulative totals were tied.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Do Their Totals Match?** Yes, both have 55 home runs at the end of August.\n- **Quick Sanity Check:** Comparing other months, August is indeed the point where they are tied.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure everything checks out.\n\n- **Cumulative Totals:** Re-calculating confirms both had 55 home runs at the end of August.\n- **Difference Before and After:** Before August, McGwire was always ahead, and after August, he pulled ahead again.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAt the end of August, McGwire and Sosa were tied in total home runs.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nAt the end of **August**, McGwire and Sosa were tied in total home runs, each with 55.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection: Does This Make Sense?**\n\n- **Initial Approach Validated:** Adding up the totals month by month was the right strategy.\n- **Alternative Strategy Helped:** Considering partial months confirmed the tie point.\n- **Final Check:** All calculations align with the data provided.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nTaking a step-by-step approach, starting with cumulative totals, and then verifying by checking differences ensured accuracy. It's essential to double-check and be open to adjusting strategies when the initial approach doesn't immediately reveal the answer.\n\n---\n\nI hope this thorough walkthrough helps in understanding how to tackle such problems systematically!\n\n---\n\nNow, let\u2019s put it all together into a complete, coherent solution.",
  "ground_truth": "We will keep a running tally of the number of home runs of the two players. By March, McGwire had 1 home run and Sosa 0. By April, McGwire had $1+10=11$ home runs and Sosa 6. By May, McGwire had $11+16=27$ home runs and Sosa $6+7=13$. By June, McGwire had $27+10=37$ home runs and Sosa $13+20=33$. By July, McGwire had $37+8=45$ home runs and Sosa $33+9=42$. By August, McGwire had $45+10=55$ home runs and Sosa $42+13=55$. Thus, by the end of $\\boxed{\\text{August}}$, McGwire and Sosa had the same number of home runs."
