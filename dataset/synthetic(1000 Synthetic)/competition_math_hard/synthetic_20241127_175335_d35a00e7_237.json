  "problem": "I am playing a walking game with myself.  On move 1, I do nothing, but on move $n$ where $2 \\le n \\le 25$, I take one step forward if $n$ is prime and two steps backwards if the number is composite.  After all 25 moves, I stop and walk back to my original starting point.  How many steps long is my walk back?",
  "solution": "Certainly! Let's tackle this problem step by step, just like solving it on paper. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their effectiveness, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's see what we're dealing with:\n\n- **Move 1:** Do nothing.\n- **Moves 2 to 25:**\n  - If \\( n \\) is **prime**, take **one step forward**.\n  - If \\( n \\) is **composite**, take **two steps backward**.\n\n**Objective:**  \nAfter all 25 moves, determine how many steps are needed to walk back to the starting point.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis reminds me of problems involving number sequences and prime identification. Listing out primes and composites within a certain range seems necessary, but I'm not entirely sure how the steps will accumulate over the moves. Exploring different strategies might help.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Listing Primes and Composites:**  \n   Identify which numbers between 2 and 25 are prime and which are composite to determine the direction of each move.\n\n2. **Calculating Net Displacement:**  \n   Compute the total steps forward and backward to find the final position.\n\n3. **Determining the Return Walk:**  \n   Once the final position is known, the return walk's length is simply the absolute value of that position.\n\n**Starting with Strategy 1:**  \nLet's list the primes and composites first to see how the moves pan out.\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying Prime and Composite Numbers from 2 to 25**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI need to know which numbers will make me move forward and which will push me backward. Primes are numbers greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Composites have additional divisors.\n\n**Listing Primes:**  \n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23\n\n**Reflecting:**  \nAre these all the primes up to 25? Let me double-check:\n\n- **2:** Only divisible by 1 and 2.\n- **3:** Only divisible by 1 and 3.\n- **5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23:** Similarly, each is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n\n**Check:**  \nYes, these are correct.\n\n**Listing Composites:**  \n4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- **4:** Divisible by 1, 2, and 4.\n- **6:** Divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n- ...and so on for the rest.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI have correctly identified the primes and composites.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Net Displacement**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to determine how each move affects my position. Let's assign steps based on the move number:\n\n- **Primes:** +1 step forward\n- **Composites:** -2 steps backward\n\n**Initial Position:**  \nStarting at position 0.\n\n**Move Calculations:**  \nLet's go through each move from 2 to 25:\n\n- **Move 2 (Prime):** +1 \u2192 Position: 1\n- **Move 3 (Prime):** +1 \u2192 Position: 2\n- **Move 4 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: 0\n- **Move 5 (Prime):** +1 \u2192 Position: 1\n- **Move 6 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: -1\n- **Move 7 (Prime):** +1 \u2192 Position: 0\n- **Move 8 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: -2\n- **Move 9 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: -4\n- **Move 10 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: -6\n- **Move 11 (Prime):** +1 \u2192 Position: -5\n- **Move 12 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: -7\n- **Move 13 (Prime):** +1 \u2192 Position: -6\n- **Move 14 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: -8\n- **Move 15 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: -10\n- **Move 16 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: -12\n- **Move 17 (Prime):** +1 \u2192 Position: -11\n- **Move 18 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: -13\n- **Move 19 (Prime):** +1 \u2192 Position: -12\n- **Move 20 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: -14\n- **Move 21 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: -16\n- **Move 22 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: -18\n- **Move 23 (Prime):** +1 \u2192 Position: -17\n- **Move 24 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: -19\n- **Move 25 (Composite):** -2 \u2192 Position: -21\n\n**Reflecting:**  \nHmm, ending at position -21 seems significant. Let's check if this makes sense by considering the total steps forward and backward.\n\n**Calculating Total Steps:**\n\n- **Total Primes (Forward):** 9 primes \u00d7 1 step = +9 steps\n- **Total Composites (Backward):** 15 composites \u00d7 2 steps = -30 steps\n\n**Net Displacement:**  \n\\( 9 - 30 = -21 \\)\n\n**Check:**  \nThe calculations align; ending at position -21 is correct.\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Return Walk**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe final position is -21, meaning I'm 21 steps away from the starting point in the negative direction. To return, I need to walk 21 steps forward.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nAbsolute value of the final position:  \n\\(|-21| = 21\\) steps\n\n**Reflecting:**  \nDoes this make sense? Given that each backward move was double the forward steps, ending up 21 steps back seems plausible.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nThe return walk is indeed 21 steps.\n\n### **Alternative Approach Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIs there another way to verify this result? Perhaps by considering the net effect of primes and composites differently.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nCalculate the net effect per step and see if it matches the final position.\n\n- **Each Prime Move:** +1 step\n- **Each Composite Move:** -2 steps\n\n**Total Moves:** 24 (since move 1 is ignored)\n\n**Net Effect Per Move:**  \n\\((9 \\times 1) + (15 \\times -2) = 9 - 30 = -21\\)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBoth approaches confirm that the final position is -21, requiring a 21-step return walk.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout this process:\n\n- **Brainstorming Different Strategies:** Initially considered listing primes and composites, calculating net displacement, and verifying through an alternative approach.\n  \n- **Frequent Checking:** After listing primes and composites, checked each step's impact on position. Calculated total forward and backward steps to ensure consistency.\n\n- **Reflecting on Correctness:** Validated the final position through multiple methods to confirm accuracy.\n\n- **Adjusting Approach as Needed:** No major adjustments were necessary since the initial strategy proved correct, but an alternative verification provided additional confidence.\n\n### **<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER>21 steps</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe walk back to the original starting point is **21 steps** long.\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem step by step, brainstorming different strategies, and continuously reflecting and verifying each part of the solution, we ensured that the final answer is both accurate and reliable.",
  "ground_truth": "We begin by counting how many prime and composite numbers there are between 2 and 25 inclusive.  The prime numbers in that range are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, so there are 9 prime numbers.  This means that there are $24 - 9 = 15$ composite numbers.\n\nFor each of the 9 prime numbers, I take one step forward, and for each of the 15 composite numbers, I take two steps back, for a net total of $9(1)+(15)(-2)=-21$ steps forward, i.e., 21 steps backwards.  Hence after 25 moves, I am 21 steps away from my original starting point, so my walk back is $\\boxed{21}$ steps long."
