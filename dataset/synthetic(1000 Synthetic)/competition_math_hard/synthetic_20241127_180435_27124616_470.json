  "solution": "Sure, let's craft a coherent and complete solution by integrating the original working process, ensuring clarity, and maintaining the final answer. We'll present the thought process naturally, reflecting authentic problem-solving strategies while keeping the final answer unchanged. Here's how it could look:\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. The problem asks us to find the sum of all integral values of \\( c \\) with \\( c \\leq 25 \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( y = x^2 - 7x - c \\) has two rational roots.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- **Hmm**, this looks like a quadratic equation problem. I recall that for a quadratic to have rational roots, the discriminant must be a perfect square.\n- **But wait**, should I consider other strategies like factoring or using the quadratic formula directly?\n- Let's brainstorm different approaches to ensure we're on the right path.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Discriminant Method:**\n   - I remember that the discriminant (\\(\\Delta\\)) of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by \\( b^2 - 4ac \\).\n   - If \\(\\Delta\\) is a perfect square, the roots are rational.\n   - **Thought:** This seems like a straightforward approach. Maybe I should start here.\n\n2. **Factoring the Quadratic:**\n   - Another way is to see if the quadratic can be factored into two linear factors with rational coefficients.\n   - **Reflection:** Factoring might be tricky since \\( c \\) is variable. It could work, but might be less efficient.\n\n3. **Using the Quadratic Formula:**\n   - The roots are given by \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2a} \\). Ensuring \\(\\sqrt{\\Delta}\\) is rational would ensure rational roots.\n   - **Thought:** This ties back to the discriminant method, so it's essentially the same.\n\n4. **Graphical Interpretation:**\n   - Visualizing the parabola and determining when it intersects the x-axis at rational points.\n   - **Reflection:** This could help for intuition but might not be practical for calculation.\n\n**Decision:** Let's start with the **Discriminant Method** since it directly relates to ensuring rational roots and seems most straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Discriminant Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Given the quadratic \\( y = x^2 - 7x - c \\), let's identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\):\n  - \\( a = 1 \\)\n  - \\( b = -7 \\)\n  - \\( c = -c \\) (Hmm, a bit confusing with the same variable name. Let's denote the constant term as \\( -c \\).)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- The discriminant (\\(\\Delta\\)) is:\n  \\[\n  \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(1)(-c) = 49 + 4c\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** So, \\(\\Delta = 49 + 4c\\). For the roots to be rational, \\( 49 + 4c \\) must be a perfect square.\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because if \\(\\Delta\\) is a perfect square, \\(\\sqrt{\\Delta}\\) is rational, leading to rational roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Perfect Square Condition**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- We need \\( 49 + 4c \\) to be a perfect square. Let's set it equal to \\( k^2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\):\n  \\[\n  49 + 4c = k^2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Rearranging:** Solve for \\( c \\):\n  \\[\n  4c = k^2 - 49 \\\\\n  c = \\frac{k^2 - 49}{4}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Wait, since \\( c \\) must be an integer, \\( k^2 - 49 \\) must be divisible by 4. Let's explore what this implies for \\( k \\).\n\n**Check:** Is the arrangement correct? Yes, rearranging to solve for \\( c \\) makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining Constraints on \\( k \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To ensure \\( \\frac{k^2 - 49}{4} \\) is an integer, \\( k^2 - 49 \\) must be divisible by 4.\n- **Calculation:** Let's analyze \\( k^2 - 49 \\) modulo 4.\n  \\[\n  k^2 \\equiv 49 \\pmod{4} \\\\\n  k^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\quad (\\text{since } 49 \\mod 4 = 1)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion:** Therefore, \\( k^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\). I remember that this happens when \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) or \\( k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\).\n\n**Check:** Is this correct? Yes, because:\n- \\( (1)^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\)\n- \\( (3)^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\)\n\n**Reflection:** The condition on \\( k \\) is clear and makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Listing Possible Values of \\( k \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, I need to find all integers \\( k \\) such that \\( k^2 \\leq 49 + 4(25) = 149 \\) (since \\( c \\leq 25 \\)) and \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) or \\( k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\).\n  \n- **Calculation:** Let's list them out.\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{149} \\approx 12.2 \\implies k \\leq 12\n  \\]\n  \n- So, possible \\( k \\) values are: -12, -11, -9, -8, -7, -5, -4, -3, -1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12\n\n**Reflection:** That's a lot of values! But wait, let's filter them to only those satisfying \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) or \\( k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\).\n\n**Check:** Is the range correct? Yes, \\( k \\) values are within the necessary bounds.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Filtering \\( k \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Only include \\( k \\) where \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) or \\( k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\).\n  \n- **Calculation:** Let's list them:\n  \\[\n  k = -11, -9, -7, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 11\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** These are the \\( k \\) values that satisfy the condition. Let's proceed to find corresponding \\( c \\) values.\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because all selected \\( k \\) values satisfy \\( k^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\).\n\n**Reflection:** Filtering is correctly applied, ensuring only valid \\( k \\) values are considered.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating Corresponding \\( c \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Use the equation \\( c = \\frac{k^2 - 49}{4} \\) to find \\( c \\) for each valid \\( k \\).\n  \n- **Calculation:** Let's compute \\( c \\) for each \\( k \\):\n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  k = -11: & \\quad c = \\frac{(-11)^2 - 49}{4} = \\frac{121 - 49}{4} = \\frac{72}{4} = 18 \\\\\n  k = -9: & \\quad c = \\frac{(-9)^2 - 49}{4} = \\frac{81 - 49}{4} = \\frac{32}{4} = 8 \\\\\n  k = -7: & \\quad c = \\frac{(-7)^2 - 49}{4} = \\frac{49 - 49}{4} = \\frac{0}{4} = 0 \\\\\n  k = -3: & \\quad c = \\frac{(-3)^2 - 49}{4} = \\frac{9 - 49}{4} = \\frac{-40}{4} = -10 \\\\\n  k = -1: & \\quad c = \\frac{(-1)^2 - 49}{4} = \\frac{1 - 49}{4} = \\frac{-48}{4} = -12 \\\\\n  k = 1: & \\quad c = \\frac{1^2 - 49}{4} = \\frac{1 - 49}{4} = \\frac{-48}{4} = -12 \\\\\n  k = 3: & \\quad c = \\frac{3^2 - 49}{4} = \\frac{9 - 49}{4} = \\frac{-40}{4} = -10 \\\\\n  k = 5: & \\quad c = \\frac{5^2 - 49}{4} = \\frac{25 - 49}{4} = \\frac{-24}{4} = -6 \\\\\n  k = 7: & \\quad c = \\frac{7^2 - 49}{4} = \\frac{49 - 49}{4} = \\frac{0}{4} = 0 \\\\\n  k = 11: & \\quad c = \\frac{11^2 - 49}{4} = \\frac{121 - 49}{4} = \\frac{72}{4} = 18 \\\\\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Some \\( k \\) values yield duplicate \\( c \\) values (e.g., \\( k = -1 \\) and \\( k = 1 \\) both give \\( c = -12 \\)). Let's ensure we only consider unique \\( c \\) values.\n\n**Check:** Are all \\( c \\) values within \\( c \\leq 25 \\)? Yes, they are.\n\n**Reflection:** Calculations are correct, and duplicate \\( c \\) values are identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Listing Unique \\( c \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Identify unique \\( c \\) values from the calculations.\n  \n- **List of Unique \\( c \\):**\n  \\[\n  c = -12, -10, -6, 0, 8, 18\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** These are the integral \\( c \\) values satisfying the condition. Now, let's verify if each \\( c \\) indeed makes the discriminant a perfect square.\n\n**Check:** Is there any \\( c \\) value that might have been missed or incorrectly calculated? Double-checking the calculations confirms that all are correct.\n\n**Reflection:** Unique \\( c \\) values are accurately listed, and no errors are found.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Verifying Each \\( c \\) Value**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- For each \\( c \\), compute \\( 49 + 4c \\) and check if it's a perfect square.\n  \n- **Verification:**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  c = -12: & \\quad 49 + 4(-12) = 49 - 48 = 1 = 1^2 \\\\\n  c = -10: & \\quad 49 + 4(-10) = 49 - 40 = 9 = 3^2 \\\\\n  c = -6: & \\quad 49 + 4(-6) = 49 - 24 = 25 = 5^2 \\\\\n  c = 0: & \\quad 49 + 4(0) = 49 = 7^2 \\\\\n  c = 8: & \\quad 49 + 4(8) = 49 + 32 = 81 = 9^2 \\\\\n  c = 18: & \\quad 49 + 4(18) = 49 + 72 = 121 = 11^2 \\\\\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** All \\( c \\) values satisfy the condition that \\( 49 + 4c \\) is a perfect square. This confirms that the roots are rational for these \\( c \\) values.\n\n**Check:** Does each calculation hold up? Yes, each \\( c \\) results in \\( 49 + 4c \\) being a perfect square.\n\n**Reflection:** Verification is successful; all conditions are met.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Calculating the Sum of Valid \\( c \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, we need to find the sum of all unique \\( c \\) values identified.\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\sum c = -12 + (-10) + (-6) + 0 + 8 + 18 = -12 - 10 - 6 + 0 + 8 + 18\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = -28 + 26 = -2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** The sum is \\( -2 \\). Let's double-check the arithmetic to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Check:** Recalculating step by step confirms that the sum is indeed \\( -2 \\).\n\n**Reflection:** Calculation is correct; the final sum is validated.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Before finalizing the answer, let's quickly review each step to ensure no mistakes were made.\n  \n- **Review:**\n  - The discriminant approach was correctly applied.\n  - Constraints on \\( k \\) were accurately determined.\n  - All \\( k \\) values were properly filtered and corresponding \\( c \\) values calculated.\n  - Verification of \\( 49 + 4c \\) being perfect squares was successful.\n  - The sum calculation was checked and confirmed.\n\n**Reflection:** Everything checks out. The approach is correct, and the calculations are accurate.\n\n**Check:** No errors found upon review. The solution is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **<Final Answer:>**\n\nThe sum of all integral values of \\( c \\) with \\( c \\leq 25 \\) for which the equation \\( y = x^2 - 7x - c \\) has two rational roots is **-2**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n**Approach Used:**\n\n- **Discriminant Method:** Ensured that the discriminant \\( \\Delta = 49 + 4c \\) is a perfect square for rational roots.\n\n**Steps Taken:**\n\n1. **Applied Discriminant Formula:** Calculated \\( \\Delta = 49 + 4c \\).\n2. **Set Perfect Square Condition:** \\( 49 + 4c = k^2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n3. **Derived \\( c \\) in Terms of \\( k \\):** \\( c = \\frac{k^2 - 49}{4} \\).\n4. **Determined Constraints on \\( k \\):** \\( k^2 - 49 \\) must be divisible by 4, leading to \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) or \\( k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\).\n5. **Listed Valid \\( k \\) Values:** Identified \\( k \\) values within the range that satisfy the condition.\n6. **Calculated Corresponding \\( c \\) Values:** Computed \\( c \\) for each valid \\( k \\).\n7. **Verified Perfect Square Condition:** Ensured \\( 49 + 4c \\) is a perfect square for each \\( c \\).\n8. **Summed Unique \\( c \\) Values:** Added all unique \\( c \\) values to find the final sum.\n\n**Final Answer:** The sum is **-2**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Reflection**\n\n- **Does the solution align with the original problem?** Yes, all steps adhere to the requirements of finding integral \\( c \\) values with rational roots.\n- **Were all possible \\( c \\) values considered?** Yes, through systematic filtering and verification.\n- **Is the final sum accurate?** Yes, recalculations confirm the sum is \\( -2 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:** The solution is complete and correct, with the final answer being **-2**.",
  "ground_truth": "In order for the equation to have to real roots, its discriminant, $b^2-4ac=(-7)^2-4(1)(-c)=49+4c$ must be greater than zero. So we have \\begin{align*}\n49+4c&>0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n4c&>-49\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nc&>\\frac{-49}{4}=-12.25.\n\\end{align*}Since $c$ must be an integer, we have $c\\ge -12$.\n\nNow we must ensure that the roots are rational. The roots are of the form $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Since $a$, $b$ and $c$ are integers, the roots are rational so long as $\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}$ is rational, so we must have $b^2-4ac$ is a perfect square. Plugging in the values from our quadratic, we have $49+4c$ is a perfect square. Since $-12\\le c \\le 25$, we have $-48\\le 4c\\le 100$, so $1\\le 49+4c\\le 149$. There are $12$ possible squares between $1$ and $149$ inclusive, so we only need to check those $12$ squares to see if $c$ is an integer. But we can narrow this down further: the value of $49+4c$ must be odd, so it can only be the square of an odd integer. Thus the possible values for $49+4c$ are the squares of the odd numbers from $1$ to $11$. We solve:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccc}\n$49+4c=1$&$\\Rightarrow$&$4c=-48$&$\\Rightarrow$&$c=-12$\\\\\n$49+4c=9$&$\\Rightarrow$&$4c=-40$&$\\Rightarrow$&$c=-10$\\\\\n$49+4c=25$&$\\Rightarrow$&$4c=-24$&$\\Rightarrow$&$c=-6$\\\\\n$49+4c=49$&$\\Rightarrow$&$4c=0$&$\\Rightarrow$&$c=0$\\\\\n$49+4c=81$&$\\Rightarrow$&$4c=32$&$\\Rightarrow$&$c=8$\\\\\n$49+4c=121$&$\\Rightarrow$&$4c=72$&$\\Rightarrow$&$c=18$\n\\end{tabular}All of the values work! Their sum is $(-12)+(-10)+(-6)+0+8+18=\\boxed{-2}$."
