  "solution": "Certainly! Let's walk through the solution step by step, ensuring clarity and coherence while maintaining the correctness of the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWe're given a wire cut into two pieces: one of length \\( a \\) and the other \\( b \\). The piece of length \\( a \\) is bent into an equilateral triangle, and the piece of length \\( b \\) into a regular hexagon. The areas of both shapes are equal. Our goal is to find the ratio \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- This problem involves the perimeter and area of regular polygons.\n- Since the areas are equal, we can set up an equation relating the areas of the triangle and hexagon.\n- Expressing the areas in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) seems necessary.\n- Remembering that all sides of regular polygons are equal will be helpful.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWe need to find expressions for the areas of both shapes using their respective perimeters, then equate these areas to solve for the ratio \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Strategies**\n\n**First Strategy: Express Areas in Terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)**\n\n- For the **equilateral triangle**: All sides are equal, so the perimeter is \\( a \\). Therefore, each side is \\( \\frac{a}{3} \\).\n- For the **hexagon**: Similarly, the perimeter is \\( b \\), so each side is \\( \\frac{b}{6} \\).\n\n**Second Thoughts:**\n\nThis approach seems logical. By determining the side lengths, we can use standard area formulas for these shapes.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because the area formulas depend directly on the side lengths. Let's proceed with calculating the areas.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Areas**\n\n**Calculating the Area of the Equilateral Triangle:**\n\n- **Formula:**  \n  The area \\( A \\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\( s \\) is:  \n  \\[ A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \\]\n\n- **Substitute \\( s = \\frac{a}{3} \\):**  \n  \\[ A_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\left(\\frac{a}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot \\frac{a^2}{9} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{36} a^2 \\]\n\n**Calculating the Area of the Regular Hexagon:**\n\n- **Formula:**  \n  The area \\( A \\) of a regular hexagon with side length \\( t \\) is:  \n  \\[ A = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} t^2 \\]\n\n- **Substitute \\( t = \\frac{b}{6} \\):**  \n  \\[ A_{\\text{hexagon}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\left(\\frac{b}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{b^2}{36} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{24} b^2 \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Triangle Area:**  \n  \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{36} a^2\\) seems correct given the squared side length.\n\n- **Hexagon Area:**  \n  \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{24} b^2\\) also appears accurate.\n\nEverything checks out so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Equating the Areas:**\n\nSince the areas are equal:  \n\\[ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{36} a^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{24} b^2 \\]\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**\n\n- **Divide both sides by \\( \\sqrt{3} \\):**  \n  \\[ \\frac{1}{36} a^2 = \\frac{1}{24} b^2 \\]\n\n- **Multiply both sides by 36 to eliminate fractions:**  \n  \\[ a^2 = \\frac{36}{24} b^2 \\]\n\n- **Simplify \\( \\frac{36}{24} \\) to \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\):**  \n  \\[ a^2 = \\frac{3}{2} b^2 \\]\n\n**Checking the Simplification:**\n\nDoes \\( \\frac{36}{24} \\) simplify to \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\)?  \n- Yes, because \\( 36 \\div 12 = 3 \\) and \\( 24 \\div 12 = 2 \\).\n\nThis confirms the simplification is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving for \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\)**\n\n**Taking the Square Root of Both Sides:**\n\n\\[ a = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\, b \\]\n\n**Expressing \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\):**\n\n\\[ \\frac{a}{b} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\]\n\n**Simplifying the Square Root:**\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2} \\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?**  \n  Yes, the ratio being in terms of square roots is typical for geometric problems involving regular polygons.\n\nEverything aligns well, confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully working through each step, the ratio of the lengths is:\n\n\\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}\\)\n\n<ANSWER>\\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}\\)</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Effectiveness:**  \n  By expressing the areas in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), setting them equal, and simplifying, we arrived at the desired ratio efficiently.\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  Each step was verified to ensure correctness, making the solution robust.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:**  \n  No alternative strategies were needed once the initial approach proved successful.\n\n- **Overall Reflection:**  \n  This method was straightforward and effective. By breaking down the problem into manageable parts\u2014calculating side lengths, finding areas, and equating them\u2014we systematically solved for \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\).\n\n---\n\nThis structured approach ensures that each step is clear and logically follows from the previous one, leading us confidently to the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "The side length of the triangle and hexagon are $\\frac{a}{3}$ and $\\frac{b}{6},$ respectively, so their areas are \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\left(\\frac{a}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{a^2 \\sqrt3}{36} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{3\\sqrt3}{2} \\left(\\frac{b}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{b^2\\sqrt3}{24},\\]respectively. Therefore, we have \\[\\frac{a^2\\sqrt3}{36} = \\frac{b^2\\sqrt3}{24},\\]so \\[\\frac{a^2}{b^2} = \\frac{36}{24} = \\frac{3}{2}.\\]Taking the square root of both sides, we get \\[\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{\\sqrt3}{\\sqrt2} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt6}2}.\\]"
