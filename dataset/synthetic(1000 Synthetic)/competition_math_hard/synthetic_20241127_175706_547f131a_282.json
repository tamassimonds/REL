I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and ensure I'm on the right track. Here's how I approached it:\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWe have a function \\( f \\) with a specific property:\n\n- **Whenever** \\( a + b = 2^n \\) for positive integers \\( a, b, n \\),\n- **Then** \\( f(a) + f(b) = n^2 \\).\n\nThe goal is to find \\( f(2002) \\).\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udd14 **Initial Reaction:**  \nThis looks like a functional equation involving powers of two. Perhaps expressing 2002 in terms of powers of two might help. Reminds me of problems where decomposing numbers reveals hidden patterns.</aside>\n\n---\n\n## **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Express \\( 2002 \\) as a Sum of Powers of Two:**  \n   Maybe decompose 2002 to fit the equation \\( a + b = 2^n \\).\n\n2. **Look for Patterns or Recurrence Relations:**  \n   Identifying how \\( f(a) \\) behaves for different \\( a \\) might reveal a pattern.\n\n3. **Assume a Specific Form for \\( f(x) \\):**  \n   Considering linear or quadratic forms to see if they fit.\n\n4. **Use Induction:**  \n   Establishing a general formula for \\( f(x) \\) through inductive reasoning.\n\n<aside>\ud83d\udd0d **Reflection:**  \nExpressing 2002 as a sum of powers of two seems like the most direct approach given the equation involves \\( 2^n \\). Let's start there.</aside>\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Expressing 2002 as a Sum of Powers of Two**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nGiven \\( a + b = 2^n \\), let's see if 2002 can be part of such a pair.\n\n**Action:**  \nFind \\( n \\) such that \\( 2^n \\geq 2002 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\)\n- \\( 2^{11} = 2048 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 2^{11} = 2048 \\) is the smallest power of two greater than 2002.\n\n**Thinking:**  \nSet \\( a = 2002 \\) and \\( b = 2048 - 2002 = 46 \\). This satisfies \\( a + b = 2^{11} \\).\n\n**Check:**  \n- \\( 2002 + 46 = 2048 \\), which is \\( 2^{11} \\). \u2705\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udde0 **Reflection:**  \nGreat! We found \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) that satisfy the condition with \\( n = 11 \\). According to the property:  \n\\[\nf(2002) + f(46) = 11^2 = 121\n\\]\nBut now, we have two unknowns: \\( f(2002) \\) and \\( f(46) \\). We need another equation to solve for \\( f(2002) \\).</aside>\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Finding Another Equation Involving \\( f(46) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo solve for \\( f(2002) \\), we need to know \\( f(46) \\). Let's find another pair \\( (a, b) \\) where one of them is 46.\n\n**Action:**  \nLook for \\( n \\) such that \\( 2^n \\geq 46 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- \\( 2^5 = 32 \\)\n- \\( 2^6 = 64 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 2^6 = 64 \\) is the smallest power of two greater than 46.\n\n**Thinking:**  \nSet \\( a = 46 \\) and \\( b = 64 - 46 = 18 \\).\n\n**Check:**  \n- \\( 46 + 18 = 64 \\), which is \\( 2^6 \\). \u2705\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udd14 **Reflection:**  \nThis gives us another equation:  \n\\[\nf(46) + f(18) = 6^2 = 36\n\\]\nNow we have two equations:  \n1. \\( f(2002) + f(46) = 121 \\)  \n2. \\( f(46) + f(18) = 36 \\)  \nWe still need to find \\( f(18) \\) to proceed.</aside>\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Finding \\( f(18) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's find another pair involving 18 to create a third equation.\n\n**Action:**  \nLook for \\( n \\) such that \\( 2^n \\geq 18 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- \\( 2^4 = 16 \\)\n- \\( 2^5 = 32 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) is the smallest power of two greater than 18.\n\n**Thinking:**  \nSet \\( a = 18 \\) and \\( b = 32 - 18 = 14 \\).\n\n**Check:**  \n- \\( 18 + 14 = 32 \\), which is \\( 2^5 \\). \u2705\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udde0 **Reflection:**  \nThis gives us:  \n\\[\nf(18) + f(14) = 5^2 = 25\n\\]\nNow we have three equations:  \n1. \\( f(2002) + f(46) = 121 \\)  \n2. \\( f(46) + f(18) = 36 \\)  \n3. \\( f(18) + f(14) = 25 \\)  \nWe need to continue this process to find all necessary function values.</aside>\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Continuing the Chain to Find \\( f(14) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's find another equation involving \\( f(14) \\).\n\n**Action:**  \nLook for \\( n \\) such that \\( 2^n \\geq 14 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- \\( 2^4 = 16 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 2^4 = 16 \\) is the smallest power of two greater than 14.\n\n**Thinking:**  \nSet \\( a = 14 \\) and \\( b = 16 - 14 = 2 \\).\n\n**Check:**  \n- \\( 14 + 2 = 16 \\), which is \\( 2^4 \\). \u2705\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udd14 **Reflection:**  \nThis gives us:  \n\\[\nf(14) + f(2) = 4^2 = 16\n\\]\nNow we have four equations:  \n1. \\( f(2002) + f(46) = 121 \\)  \n2. \\( f(46) + f(18) = 36 \\)  \n3. \\( f(18) + f(14) = 25 \\)  \n4. \\( f(14) + f(2) = 16 \\)  \nWe still need more information to solve for \\( f(2002) \\).</aside>\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Finding \\( f(2) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince 2 is a small number, maybe we can find its value directly.\n\n**Action:**  \nConsider \\( n = 1 \\), so \\( 2^1 = 2 \\). Set \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 2 - 1 = 1 \\).\n\n**Check:**  \n- \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\), which is \\( 2^1 \\). \u2705\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udde0 **Reflection:**  \nThis gives us:  \n\\[\nf(1) + f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \\implies 2f(1) = 1 \\implies f(1) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nBut wait, do we have an equation involving \\( f(1) \\) and \\( f(2) \\)? Not directly. Let's think again.</aside>\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nLet's find another pair involving \\( f(2) \\).\n\n**Action:**  \nConsider \\( n = 2 \\), so \\( 2^2 = 4 \\). Set \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 4 - 2 = 2 \\).\n\n**Check:**  \n- \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\), which is \\( 2^2 \\). \u2705\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udd14 **Reflection:**  \nThis gives us:  \n\\[\nf(2) + f(2) = 4 \\implies 2f(2) = 4 \\implies f(2) = 2\n\\]\n<aside>\ud83e\udde0 **Verification:**  \n\\[\n2f(2) = 4 \\implies f(2) = 2\n\\]\nThis seems consistent. Let's proceed.</aside>\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Back-Substituting to Find Other Function Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that we know \\( f(2) = 2 \\), let's substitute back into our previous equations to find other values.\n\n**Action:**  \nStarting with Equation 4:  \n\\[\nf(14) + f(2) = 16 \\implies f(14) + 2 = 16 \\implies f(14) = 14\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n\\[\nf(14) + 2 = 16 \\implies f(14) = 14 \\ \u2705\n\\]\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udd14 **Reflection:**  \nThis checks out. Let's move to the next equation.</aside>\n\n**Next Substitution:**  \nUsing Equation 3:  \n\\[\nf(18) + f(14) = 25 \\implies f(18) + 14 = 25 \\implies f(18) = 11\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n\\[\nf(18) + 14 = 25 \\implies f(18) = 11 \\ \u2705\n\\]\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udde0 **Reflection:**  \nSo far, so good. Let's continue.</aside>\n\n**Next Substitution:**  \nUsing Equation 2:  \n\\[\nf(46) + f(18) = 36 \\implies f(46) + 11 = 36 \\implies f(46) = 25\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n\\[\nf(46) + 11 = 36 \\implies f(46) = 25 \\ \u2705\n\\]\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udd14 **Reflection:**  \nEverything seems consistent. Now, let's find \\( f(2002) \\).</aside>\n\n---\n\n## **Step 7: Solving for \\( f(2002) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that we have \\( f(46) = 25 \\), we can use Equation 1 to solve for \\( f(2002) \\).\n\n**Action:**  \n\\[\nf(2002) + f(46) = 121 \\implies f(2002) + 25 = 121 \\implies f(2002) = 96\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n\\[\nf(2002) + 25 = 121 \\implies f(2002) = 96 \\ \u2705\n\\]\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udde0 **Reflection:**  \nThis seems correct. But let's double-check by considering another approach to ensure consistency.</aside>\n\n---\n\n## **Alternative Approach: Verifying Consistency**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo make sure our solution is correct, let's see if there's a general pattern or formula for \\( f(x) \\) that aligns with our findings.\n\n**Action:**  \nLooking at the equations we've used:\n\n1. \\( f(2002) + f(46) = 121 \\)  \n2. \\( f(46) + f(18) = 36 \\)  \n3. \\( f(18) + f(14) = 25 \\)  \n4. \\( f(14) + f(2) = 16 \\)  \n5. \\( f(2) = 2 \\)  \n\nIt seems like \\( f(x) \\) increases linearly as \\( x \\) increases. Let's see if we can deduce a pattern.\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udd14 **Thinking:**  \nMaybe \\( f(x) \\) is proportional to \\( x \\) in some way. Let's test this hypothesis.</aside>\n\n**Hypothesis:**  \nSuppose \\( f(x) = x - c \\) for some constant \\( c \\).\n\n**Testing the Hypothesis:**  \nUsing Equation 4:  \n\\[\nf(14) + f(2) = 16 \\implies (14 - c) + (2 - c) = 16 \\implies 16 - 2c = 16 \\implies 2c = 0 \\implies c = 0\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis suggests that \\( f(x) = x \\).\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udde0 **Verification:**  \nBut wait, if \\( f(x) = x \\), let's check if it holds for all our equations.\n\n- Equation 1: \\( f(2002) + f(46) = 2002 + 46 = 2048 \\neq 121 \\)\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udd14 **Reflection:**  \nThis can't be right. Our hypothesis \\( f(x) = x \\) doesn't fit all the equations. Therefore, \\( f(x) \\) can't be simply \\( x \\).</aside>\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis:**  \nPerhaps \\( f(x) \\) is piecewise or has different behaviors based on \\( x \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLooking back at our approach, we consistently found specific function values by creating equations based on the given property. This method seems reliable, so maybe there's no simple general formula, but rather specific values that satisfy the conditions.\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udde0 **Final Reflection:**  \nGiven that our original step-by-step approach led us to consistent function values, and alternative hypotheses don't align with all equations, it's safe to conclude that our original solution is correct.</aside>\n\n---\n\n## **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, let's ensure that all our substitutions and calculations are correct.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1. & \\quad f(2002) + f(46) = 121 \\\\\n   & \\quad 96 + 25 = 121 \\ \u2705 \\\\\n\\\\\n2. & \\quad f(46) + f(18) = 36 \\\\\n   & \\quad 25 + 11 = 36 \\ \u2705 \\\\\n\\\\\n3. & \\quad f(18) + f(14) = 25 \\\\\n   & \\quad 11 + 14 = 25 \\ \u2705 \\\\\n\\\\\n4. & \\quad f(14) + f(2) = 16 \\\\\n   & \\quad 14 + 2 = 16 \\ \u2705 \\\\\n\\\\\n5. & \\quad f(2) = 2 \\ \u2705 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n                           \n---\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udd14 **Reflection:**  \nAll equations are satisfied, indicating that our solution is correct.</aside>\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAfter systematically applying the given property and back-substituting to find specific function values, we've determined:\n\n\\(\\boxed{96}\\)\n\n<aside>\ud83e\udde0 **Final Reflection:**  \nBy carefully following a chain of equations and verifying each step, we've confidently arrived at the correct solution: \\( f(2002) = 96 \\).</aside>\n\n---\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nThrough a step-by-step exploration, reflecting at each stage, and considering alternative approaches, we've successfully determined that \\( f(2002) = 96 \\).
