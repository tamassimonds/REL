  "problem": "When the product $(3x+2y+1)(x+4y+5)$ is expanded, what is the sum of the coefficients of the terms which contain a nonzero power of $y$?",
  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's dive into this problem, taking it one step at a time, just like how we'd naturally tackle it in our minds. We'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect along the way, and adjust our approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, so the problem asks us to expand the product \\((3x + 2y + 1)(x + 4y + 5)\\) and determine the sum of the coefficients of the terms containing a nonzero power of \\(y\\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\n- Hmm, this looks like a straightforward polynomial expansion problem.\n- It reminds me of using the distributive property (also known as FOIL for binomials), but since these are trinomials, it might be a bit more involved.\n- I need to focus on terms that include \\(y\\), so maybe I can ignore terms that don't have \\(y\\) to save time.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Full Expansion:** Expand the entire product and then pick out the terms with \\(y\\).\n2. **Selective Expansion:** Only multiply the parts that will yield terms with \\(y\\).\n3. **Coefficient Extraction:** Think about how coefficients of \\(y\\) terms are formed without fully expanding.\n\nI'm leaning towards starting with the **Full Expansion** to ensure I don't miss anything, and if it gets too cumbersome, I'll switch to **Selective Expansion**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Full Expansion Strategy**\n\nLet\u2019s try expanding the entire product using the distributive property.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- We'll multiply each term in the first trinomial by each term in the second trinomial.\n- This will give us a total of \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) terms.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. Multiply \\(3x\\) by each term in \\((x + 4y + 5)\\):\n   - \\(3x \\cdot x = 3x^2\\)\n   - \\(3x \\cdot 4y = 12xy\\)\n   - \\(3x \\cdot 5 = 15x\\)\n\n2. Multiply \\(2y\\) by each term in \\((x + 4y + 5)\\):\n   - \\(2y \\cdot x = 2xy\\)\n   - \\(2y \\cdot 4y = 8y^2\\)\n   - \\(2y \\cdot 5 = 10y\\)\n\n3. Multiply \\(1\\) by each term in \\((x + 4y + 5)\\):\n   - \\(1 \\cdot x = x\\)\n   - \\(1 \\cdot 4y = 4y\\)\n   - \\(1 \\cdot 5 = 5\\)\n\n**Resulting Terms:**\n\n- \\(3x^2, 12xy, 15x, 2xy, 8y^2, 10y, x, 4y, 5\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Okay, now I have all the terms. Next, I need to combine like terms and identify those with \\(y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Combining Like Terms**\n\nLet\u2019s add up the terms to simplify the expression.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Combine coefficients of similar terms, especially focusing on those containing \\(y\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **\\(x^2\\) Terms:**\n  - Only one term: \\(3x^2\\)\n\n- **\\(xy\\) Terms:**\n  - \\(12xy + 2xy = 14xy\\)\n\n- **\\(x\\) Terms:**\n  - \\(15x + x = 16x\\)\n\n- **\\(y^2\\) Terms:**\n  - Only one term: \\(8y^2\\)\n\n- **\\(y\\) Terms:**\n  - \\(10y + 4y = 14y\\)\n\n- **Constant Term:**\n  - Only one term: \\(5\\)\n\n**Simplified Expression:**\n\n\\[3x^2 + 14xy + 16x + 8y^2 + 14y + 5\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This looks correct. All like terms are combined. Now, I can see which terms contain \\(y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Terms with Nonzero Powers of \\(y\\)**\n\nLet\u2019s pick out the terms that include \\(y\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I need to focus only on terms where \\(y\\) appears, whether it's \\(y^1\\) or \\(y^2\\).\n\n**Identified Terms:**\n\n- \\(14xy\\)\n- \\(8y^2\\)\n- \\(14y\\)\n\n**Checking:**\n\n- Yup, these are all the terms that contain \\(y\\). No other terms have \\(y\\) present.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Summing the Coefficients of \\(y\\) Terms**\n\nNow, let\u2019s add up the coefficients of the identified \\(y\\) terms.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Extract the numerical coefficients from each \\(y\\) term and sum them up.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Coefficient of \\(14xy\\) is \\(14\\)\n- Coefficient of \\(8y^2\\) is \\(8\\)\n- Coefficient of \\(14y\\) is \\(14\\)\n\n\\[\n14 + 8 + 14 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The sum of the coefficients is \\(36\\). This seems reasonable given the coefficients we combined earlier.\n\n---\n\n### **Check and Verification**\n\nLet\u2019s quickly verify if our approach is correct.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Double-check that no \\(y\\) terms were missed.\n- Ensure that all coefficients were added correctly.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- There were three \\(y\\) terms: \\(14xy, 8y^2, 14y\\).\n- The coefficients \\(14, 8, 14\\) add up to \\(36\\).\n- No other terms containing \\(y\\) are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Everything checks out. The sum of the coefficients of terms containing \\(y\\) is indeed \\(36\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Selective Expansion**\n\nJust to be thorough, let\u2019s briefly consider an alternative strategy where we only focus on multiplying terms that will produce \\(y\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This might save time by ignoring terms that don't involve \\(y\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Multiply \\(3x, 2y, 1\\) from the first trinomial only with terms from the second trinomial that contain \\(y\\).\n\n1. **\\(3x \\cdot 4y = 12xy\\)**\n2. **\\(2y \\cdot x = 2xy\\)**\n3. **\\(2y \\cdot 4y = 8y^2\\)**\n4. **\\(2y \\cdot 5 = 10y\\)**\n5. **\\(1 \\cdot 4y = 4y\\)**\n\n**Combining Like Terms:**\n\n- \\(12xy + 2xy = 14xy\\)\n- \\(10y + 4y = 14y\\)\n- \\(8y^2\\) remains as is.\n\n**Sum of Coefficients:**\n\n\\[\n14 + 8 + 14 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The alternative strategy leads to the same result, confirming the correctness of the initial approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>The sum of the coefficients of the terms containing a nonzero power of \\(y\\) is \\(36\\).</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, starting with a full expansion, and verifying through selective expansion, we've confidently arrived at the solution. Checking each step ensured that no errors were made, and considering alternative methods helped validate the correctness of the approach.\n\nThinking through the problem like this\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, and checking\u2014ensures a thorough understanding and accurate solution.",
  "ground_truth": "We multiply out using the distributive property:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\phantom{==}(3x+2y+1)(x+4y+5)\\\\\n&=3x(x+4y+5)+2y(x+4y+5)+1(x+4y+5)\\\\\n&=3x^2+12xy+15x+2xy+8y^2+10y+x+4y+5\\\\\n&=3x^2+14xy+16x+8y^2+14y+5.\n\\end{align*}Those terms which contain some power of $y$ are $14xy$, $8y^2$, and $14y$, and the sum of the coefficients is $14+8+14=\\boxed{36}$."
