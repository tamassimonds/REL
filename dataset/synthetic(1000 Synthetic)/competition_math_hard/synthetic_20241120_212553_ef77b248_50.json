    "working_out": "## **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We're given an equation involving positive real numbers \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n3 = k^2 \\left( \\frac{x^2}{y^2} + \\frac{y^2}{x^2} \\right) + k \\left( \\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{y}{x} \\right)\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to find the maximum possible value of \\( k \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \n- The equation involves ratios of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), both squared and linear, multiplied by \\( k \\) and \\( k^2 \\).\n- This symmetry suggests that perhaps \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are related in a way that could simplify the expression.\n- Maybe setting \\( \\frac{x}{y} = t \\) could help, or applying inequalities like AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean Inequality) might be useful.\n\n**Brainstorming Ideas:**\n- **Substitution:** Let\u2019s try substituting \\( \\frac{x}{y} = t \\) to simplify the equation.\n- **Inequalities:** Use AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz to bound the expression.\n- **Symmetry Considerations:** Given the symmetry in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), perhaps \\( x = y \\) simplifies things.\n\nI\u2019ll start with substitution to see if it leads anywhere.\n\n## **Step 2: Attempting Substitution**\n\nLet\u2019s set \\( \\frac{x}{y} = t \\). Since \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive, \\( t \\) is also positive. Then, \\( \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{1}{t} \\).\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n\\[\n3 = k^2 \\left( t^2 + \\frac{1}{t^2} \\right) + k \\left( t + \\frac{1}{t} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This substitution reduces the problem to a single variable, which is often helpful.\n- Now, the equation involves \\( t \\), \\( k \\), and their reciprocals, which still maintains symmetry.\n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Maybe express everything in terms of \\( t \\) and try to find a relationship between \\( k \\) and \\( t \\).\n- Alternatively, think about how to optimize \\( k \\) given this equation.\n\n## **Step 3: Exploring the Relationship Between \\( k \\) and \\( t \\)**\n\nLooking at the equation:\n\n\\[\n3 = k^2 \\left( t^2 + \\frac{1}{t^2} \\right) + k \\left( t + \\frac{1}{t} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Observations:**  \n- The expression \\( t^2 + \\frac{1}{t^2} \\) and \\( t + \\frac{1}{t} \\) are both even functions of \\( t \\), which suggests that the minimum or maximum occurs at specific values of \\( t \\).\n- Maybe we can express \\( t^2 + \\frac{1}{t^2} \\) in terms of \\( t + \\frac{1}{t} \\) to simplify things.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n(t + \\frac{1}{t})^2 = t^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{t^2} \\implies t^2 + \\frac{1}{t^2} = (t + \\frac{1}{t})^2 - 2\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s set \\( a = t + \\frac{1}{t} \\). Then:\n\n\\[\nt^2 + \\frac{1}{t^2} = a^2 - 2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n3 = k^2 (a^2 - 2) + ka\n\\]\n\\[\n3 = k^2 a^2 - 2k^2 + ka\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging:**\n\\[\nk^2 a^2 + ka - 2k^2 - 3 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This is a quadratic in terms of \\( a \\), which is good because we can potentially solve for \\( a \\) in terms of \\( k \\).\n- But, before diving deeper, let's think if this is the right path. Solving quadratics can be messy, and I'm not sure if it'll lead directly to maximizing \\( k \\).\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \n- Maybe instead of solving for \\( a \\), we can use inequalities to bound \\( a \\) and thus \\( k \\).\n- AM-GM might be applicable here because \\( t + \\frac{1}{t} \\geq 2 \\) for all positive \\( t \\).\n\n## **Step 4: Applying AM-GM Inequality**\n\nGiven that for any positive \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\nt + \\frac{1}{t} \\geq 2\n\\]\n\\[\nt^2 + \\frac{1}{t^2} \\geq 2\n\\]\n\n**Implications:**  \n- The minimum value for \\( t + \\frac{1}{t} \\) is 2, and similarly, for \\( t^2 + \\frac{1}{t^2} \\), it\u2019s also 2.\n- If we can find the conditions under which these minima are achieved, it might help in maximizing \\( k \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- When does \\( t + \\frac{1}{t} = 2 \\)? That happens when \\( t = 1 \\).\n- Similarly, \\( t^2 + \\frac{1}{t^2} = 2 \\) when \\( t = 1 \\).\n\n**Checking \\( t = 1 \\):**\n- If \\( t = 1 \\), then \\( x = y \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( t = 1 \\) back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n3 = k^2 (1^2 + 1^2) + k (1 + 1) = 2k^2 + 2k\n\\]\n\\[\n3 = 2k^2 + 2k\n\\]\n\\[\nk^2 + k - \\frac{3}{2} = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solving the Quadratic:**\n\\[\nk = \\frac{{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{{1 + 6}}}}{2} = \\frac{{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{7}}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) is positive:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{{-1 + \\sqrt{7}}}{2} \\approx 0.8229\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This gives us a potential maximum value for \\( k \\). However, to be certain it's the maximum, we need to verify whether this is indeed the maximal point or if \\( k \\) can be larger under different conditions.\n\n**Next Steps:**  \n- Consider whether there might be other values of \\( t \\) that could lead to a larger \\( k \\).\n- Maybe analyze the behavior of the equation as \\( t \\) varies to ensure that \\( t = 1 \\) yields the maximum \\( k \\).\n\n## **Step 5: Verifying the Maximum**\n\nTo confirm that \\( k = \\frac{{-1 + \\sqrt{7}}}{2} \\) is indeed the maximum, let's analyze the equation further.\n\n**Rewriting the Equation:**\n\\[\n3 = k^2 \\left( \\frac{x^2}{y^2} + \\frac{y^2}{x^2} \\right) + k \\left( \\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{y}{x} \\right)\n\\]\n\nGiven our substitution \\( t = \\frac{x}{y} \\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n3 = k^2 (t^2 + \\frac{1}{t^2}) + k (t + \\frac{1}{t})\n\\]\n\n**Observations:**\n- The expressions \\( t^2 + \\frac{1}{t^2} \\) and \\( t + \\frac{1}{t} \\) are minimized when \\( t = 1 \\).\n- Since \\( k^2 \\) and \\( k \\) are multiplied by these expressions, minimizing \\( t^2 + \\frac{1}{t^2} \\) and \\( t + \\frac{1}{t} \\) should help in maximizing \\( k \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- At \\( t = 1 \\), both expressions are minimized, which should, in turn, allow \\( k \\) to reach its maximum possible value while satisfying the equation.\n- Therefore, \\( k = \\frac{{-1 + \\sqrt{7}}}{2} \\) is indeed the maximum possible value.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{{-1 + \\sqrt{7}}}{2}}\n\\]\n\n## **Step 6: Reviewing the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure the solution makes sense.\n\n**Check:**\n- When \\( t = 1 \\) (i.e., \\( x = y \\)), the equation simplifies nicely, leading us to a quadratic in \\( k \\).\n- Solving the quadratic yields a positive value for \\( k \\), which aligns with the problem's requirement that \\( k \\) is a positive real number.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The substitution approach worked well here, reducing the problem to a single variable and allowing us to apply inequalities to find the maximum.\n- Applying AM-GM was key in identifying that \\( t = 1 \\) would yield the maximum \\( k \\).\n\n**Alternative Verification:**\n- One could also consider taking derivatives if we treated \\( k \\) as a function of \\( t \\), but given the symmetry and the application of AM-GM, it's evident that \\( t = 1 \\) is the optimal point.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- The problem leveraged symmetry and inequalities effectively to simplify the equation and find the maximum \\( k \\).\n- Always ensuring that substitutions and inequalities align with the constraints (positive real numbers here) is crucial in such problems.\n\n**End of Solution.**",
