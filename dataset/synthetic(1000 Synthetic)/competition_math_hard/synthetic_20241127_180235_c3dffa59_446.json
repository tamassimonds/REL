  "problem": "A boy has the following seven coins in his pocket: $2$ pennies, $2$ nickels, $2$ dimes, and $1$ quarter. He takes out two coins, records the sum of their values, and then puts them back with the other coins. He continues to take out two coins, record the sum of their values, and put them back. How many different sums can he record at most?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem as naturally as possible, reflecting our thought process along the way. We'll brainstorm different strategies, check our work frequently, and adjust our approach as needed. Here's how we might proceed:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. The question involves coins with different denominations, and we're supposed to find the number of unique sums that can be recorded by picking two coins at a time.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- This reminds me of problems involving combinations where we need to consider all possible pairs.\n- I'm thinking about listing all possible sums, but is that the most efficient way?\n- Maybe there's a pattern or formula that could help.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure at the moment. It might be helpful to explore different strategies to see which one fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**1. Listing All Possible Coin Pairs:**\n\n- We could list out all pairs of coins and calculate their sums.\n- This seems straightforward but might be time-consuming.\n\n**2. Using Combinatorics:**\n\n- Perhaps using combinations to determine how many pairs there are and what their sums could be.\n- Could be efficient if applied correctly.\n\n**3. Looking for Patterns or Symmetry:**\n\n- Maybe the sums exhibit some symmetry that reduces the number of unique sums.\n- Not sure how to apply this yet, but it's worth considering.\n\n**4. Thinking About the Range of Possible Sums:**\n\n- Considering the smallest and largest possible sums to narrow down the possibilities.\n- Could help in verifying our results.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI think starting with **listing all possible pairs** is a good approach to get a concrete understanding, and then we can see if patterns emerge that allow us to use more advanced techniques. If it gets too complicated, we can pivot to another strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Listing All Possible Coin Pairs**\n\nLet's list all the coins and their values first:\n\n- **Pennies (P):** 2 coins, each worth 1 cent\n- **Nickels (N):** 2 coins, each worth 5 cents\n- **Dimes (D):** 2 coins, each worth 10 cents\n- **Quarter (Q):** 1 coin worth 25 cents\n\nSo, the coins are: P\u2081, P\u2082, N\u2081, N\u2082, D\u2081, D\u2082, Q.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- We need to pick two coins at a time.\n- Since order doesn't matter (i.e., picking P\u2081 and P\u2082 is the same as P\u2082 and P\u2081), we're dealing with combinations, not permutations.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- The number of ways to pick two coins out of seven is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{7}{2} \\).\n  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\text{ pairs}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Okay, so there are 21 possible pairs. This seems manageable to list out, so let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Sum for Each Pair**\n\nNow, let's list each pair and calculate their sums. I'll keep track of the sums to see which ones are unique.\n\n**List of Pairs and Their Sums:**\n\n1. **P\u2081 and P\u2082:** 1 + 1 = 2\n2. **P\u2081 and N\u2081:** 1 + 5 = 6\n3. **P\u2081 and N\u2082:** 1 + 5 = 6\n4. **P\u2081 and D\u2081:** 1 + 10 = 11\n5. **P\u2081 and D\u2082:** 1 + 10 = 11\n6. **P\u2081 and Q:** 1 + 25 = 26\n7. **P\u2082 and N\u2081:** 1 + 5 = 6\n8. **P\u2082 and N\u2082:** 1 + 5 = 6\n9. **P\u2082 and D\u2081:** 1 + 10 = 11\n10. **P\u2082 and D\u2082:** 1 + 10 = 11\n11. **P\u2082 and Q:** 1 + 25 = 26\n12. **N\u2081 and N\u2082:** 5 + 5 = 10\n13. **N\u2081 and D\u2081:** 5 + 10 = 15\n14. **N\u2081 and D\u2082:** 5 + 10 = 15\n15. **N\u2081 and Q:** 5 + 25 = 30\n16. **N\u2082 and D\u2081:** 5 + 10 = 15\n17. **N\u2082 and D\u2082:** 5 + 10 = 15\n18. **N\u2082 and Q:** 5 + 25 = 30\n19. **D\u2081 and D\u2082:** 10 + 10 = 20\n20. **D\u2081 and Q:** 10 + 25 = 35\n21. **D\u2082 and Q:** 10 + 25 = 35\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Looking at the sums, I notice that some sums repeat (e.g., 6, 11, 15).\n- It's important to identify which sums are unique to determine the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Unique Sums**\n\nLet's extract the unique sums from the list above.\n\n**Unique Sums:**\n\n- **2:** From pair 1\n- **6:** From pairs 2, 3, 7, 8\n- **11:** From pairs 4, 5, 9, 10\n- **26:** From pairs 6, 11\n- **10:** From pair 12\n- **15:** From pairs 13, 14, 16, 17\n- **30:** From pairs 15, 18\n- **20:** From pair 19\n- **35:** From pairs 20, 21\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To ensure all unique sums are captured, let's list them in ascending order: 2, 6, 10, 11, 15, 20, 26, 30, 35.\n- This gives us a total of 9 unique sums.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Does this make sense? Given the denominations and the limited number of coins, having 9 unique sums seems plausible.\n- However, let's double-check to ensure no sums are missing or incorrectly repeated.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Results**\n\nIt's always good to verify our work to catch any mistakes. Let's see if we can confirm the unique sums through a different approach.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Considering the Smallest and Largest Sums**\n\n- **Smallest Sum:** 1 (penny) + 1 (penny) = 2\n- **Largest Sum:** 25 (quarter) + 10 (dime) = 35\n\n**Possible Sums Between the Smallest and Largest:**\n\n- Given the coin denominations, intermediate sums should be achievable by combining different coins.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Since we've listed all pairs and identified unique sums, and the range from 2 to 35 is covered, our initial list seems correct.\n- However, let's briefly explore another strategy to ensure completeness.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Using Combinatorics to Validate**\n\nInstead of listing, let's think about the possible sums based on coin values:\n\n- **Pennies (1\u00a2):** Can combine with nickels, dimes, and a quarter.\n- **Nickels (5\u00a2):** Can combine with another nickel, dimes, and a quarter.\n- **Dimes (10\u00a2):** Can combine with another dime and a quarter.\n- **Quarter (25\u00a2):** Can combine with other coins.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- By systematically pairing each coin with others, we can ensure all sums are accounted for.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This matches our initial list, reinforcing that there are indeed 9 unique sums.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's do a quick sanity check:\n\n**Sanity Check:**\n\n- Given the limited number of coins and denominations, having 9 unique sums out of 21 possible pairs seems reasonable.\n- Each unique sum corresponds to different combinations of coin values, and no obvious sums are missing.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Everything checks out. The initial approach of listing all pairs and identifying unique sums is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>9</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n- **9** different sums can be recorded at most.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy starting with listing all possible pairs and calculating their sums, we ensured that no combinations were overlooked. Verifying through an alternative strategy helped confirm the correctness of our initial approach. Reflecting at each step allowed us to catch any potential mistakes early and adjust our strategy as needed.\n\nThis methodical approach ensures accuracy and reliability in solving the problem.",
  "ground_truth": "The following pairs of numbers represent the values of the two coins the boy could take from his pocket: $$\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n(1,1) & (1,5) & (1,10) & (1,25) \\\\\n(5,5) & (5,10) & (5,25) & \\\\\n(10,10) & (10,25) & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$Each of the above pairs has a sum that is different from the sum of each of the other pairs. Therefore there are $\\boxed{9}$ different sums."
