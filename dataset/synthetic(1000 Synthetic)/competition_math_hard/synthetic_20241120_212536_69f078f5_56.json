    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk you through my thought process, including brainstorming different strategies, checking for correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the problem, I see that it's asking for the total cost of **South American stamps** issued **before the 1970s**. I immediately think about identifying which countries are South American and which decades fall before the 1970s. I'll need to sum up the costs of the relevant stamps based on their quantities and prices.\n\nBut wait\u2014let's slow down and make sure I fully understand the components:\n\n1. **Countries:** Brazil and Peru are in South America.\n2. **Decades Before the 1970s:** This includes the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nSo, I need to focus on Brazil and Peru stamps from the 50s and 60s. Let's jot this down to keep it clear.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **List and Sum Approach:** List all the relevant stamps' quantities, multiply each by their respective prices, and sum them up.\n   \n2. **Matrix Method:** Visualize the data in a table (as provided) and extract only the necessary cells to compute the total.\n\n3. **Simplify by Decade:** Calculate the total cost per decade first, then add them up.\n\nI think the **List and Sum Approach** is straightforward and less prone to errors, so I'll start with that. If it gets messy, I'll consider the other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Extract Relevant Data**\n\nLet's focus on Brazil and Peru stamps from the 50s and 60s. I'll pull the quantities from the table:\n\n- **Brazil:**\n  - 50s: 4 stamps\n  - 60s: 7 stamps\n\n- **Peru:**\n  - 50s: 6 stamps\n  - 60s: 4 stamps\n\nI'll double-check the table to ensure I got these numbers right. It's crucial to avoid mistakes here, as incorrect data will lead to a wrong answer.\n\n**Reflection:** Yup, the numbers match the table. Good to go!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Note the Prices**\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n- **Brazil and France:** 6 cents each\n- **Peru:** 4 cents each\n- **Spain:** 5 cents each\n\nSince I'm only dealing with Brazil and Peru, I'll ignore the others for now.\n\n**Reflection:** I initially skipped mentioning France and Spain, but it's good to note all prices to avoid confusion later. Better safe than sorry.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate Total Cost for Each Country**\n\n**A. Brazil Stamps**\n\n- **50s:** \n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ stamps} \\times 6 \\text{ cents each} = 24 \\text{ cents}\n  \\]\n\n- **60s:** \n  \\[\n  7 \\text{ stamps} \\times 6 \\text{ cents each} = 42 \\text{ cents}\n  \\]\n\n- **Total for Brazil:** \n  \\[\n  24 \\text{ cents} + 42 \\text{ cents} = 66 \\text{ cents}\n  \\]\n\n**B. Peru Stamps**\n\n- **50s:** \n  \\[\n  6 \\text{ stamps} \\times 4 \\text{ cents each} = 24 \\text{ cents}\n  \\]\n\n- **60s:** \n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ stamps} \\times 4 \\text{ cents each} = 16 \\text{ cents}\n  \\]\n\n- **Total for Peru:** \n  \\[\n  24 \\text{ cents} + 16 \\text{ cents} = 40 \\text{ cents}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** The calculations seem straightforward. However, I'll quickly add the totals again to ensure accuracy:\n\n- **Brazil:** 24 + 42 = 66 cents\n- **Peru:** 24 + 16 = 40 cents\n\nEverything checks out. No errors so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combine the Totals**\n\nNow, let's add the total costs for Brazil and Peru to find the overall cost of the South American stamps before the 1970s:\n\n\\[\n66 \\text{ cents (Brazil)} + 40 \\text{ cents (Peru)} = 106 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This gives me the total in cents, but the problem asks for the cost in dollars and cents. I almost missed that detail\u2014good catch!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Convert Cents to Dollars and Cents**\n\nSince 100 cents make up 1 dollar:\n\n\\[\n106 \\text{ cents} = 1 \\text{ dollar and } 6 \\text{ cents} = \\$1.06\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** It's essential to present the final answer in the required format. Converting cents to dollars ensures clarity and correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nIn dollars and cents, Juan's South American stamps issued before the 1970s cost him **\\$1.06**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically extracting the relevant data, calculating each component's cost, and carefully adding them up, I arrived at the correct total. Along the way, I made sure to double-check each step to catch any potential errors early. This approach ensures accuracy and reliability in problem-solving.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",
