  "solution": "Certainly! Let's create a polished, coherent solution by weaving together the natural thought processes, reflections, and strategies explored in the original working. We'll maintain the authentic human approach\u2014embracing brainstorming, checking for mistakes, and adjusting strategies\u2014while ensuring clarity and logical flow.\n\n---\n\n## **Solving the Probability Problem: A Human Approach**\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nAlright, we need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point \\( P \\) inside a rectangle is closer to the origin \\((0,0)\\) than to the point \\((3,1)\\). This reminds me of distance comparison problems in geometry, but I'm not entirely sure where to begin. Let's brainstorm some strategies.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Compute Distances Directly:**  \n   Compare the distances from \\( P \\) to both points and set up an inequality.\n\n2. **Perpendicular Bisector Method:**  \n   Find the line where points are equidistant from both the origin and \\((3,1)\\) to visualize the dividing region.\n\n3. **Coordinate Geometry Approach:**  \n   Use algebra to define the area within the rectangle satisfying the condition.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll three strategies seem viable, but starting with direct distance comparison (Strategy 1) might be straightforward. If it gets complicated, I'll switch to visualizing the problem using the perpendicular bisector (Strategy 2).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Strategy 1\u2014Setting Up the Inequality**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's express the condition mathematically: the distance from \\( P(x, y) \\) to the origin should be less than the distance to \\((3,1)\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance to } (0,0):\\quad \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Distance to } (3,1):\\quad \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2}\n\\]\n\nSo, we need:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2}\n\\]\n\n**Next Steps:**  \nSquare both sides to eliminate the square roots and simplify the inequality.\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 < (x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**  \nExpanding the right side:\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9\n\\]\n\\[\n(y - 1)^2 = y^2 - 2y + 1\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back:\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 - 2y + 1\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Both Sides:**  \nSubtract \\( x^2 \\) and \\( y^2 \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n0 < -6x - 2y + 10\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\\[\n6x + 2y < 10\n\\]\n\n**Final Inequality:**  \nDivide both sides by 2 to simplify:\n\\[\n3x + y < 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis inequality represents a linear boundary. Points inside the rectangle satisfying \\( 3x + y < 5 \\) are closer to the origin. It seems straightforward, but I need to visualize it to confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Visualizing the Inequality\u2014Checking Strategy 1**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's see where the line \\( 3x + y = 5 \\) intersects the rectangle to understand which region satisfies \\( 3x + y < 5 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \nFind intersections of the line with the rectangle's boundaries:\n\n- **Top Boundary (\\( y = 1 \\)):**\n  \\[\n  3x + 1 = 5 \\implies 3x = 4 \\implies x = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.33\n  \\]\n  Point: \\(\\left(\\frac{4}{3}, 1\\right)\\)\n\n- **Bottom Boundary (\\( y = 0 \\)):**\n  \\[\n  3x + 0 = 5 \\implies x = \\frac{5}{3} \\approx 1.67\n  \\]\n  Point: \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{3}, 0\\right)\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe line intersects the rectangle at \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{3}, 0\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{4}{3}, 1\\right)\\), forming a trapezoidal region below the line. This region represents points closer to the origin. So far, Strategy 1 is working.\n\n**But Wait\u2026**  \nIs this the most efficient way? Maybe using the perpendicular bisector (Strategy 2) could provide additional confirmation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Switching to Strategy 2\u2014Using the Perpendicular Bisector**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's find the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining \\((0,0)\\) and \\((3,1)\\). This bisector represents points equidistant from both, so the region closer to the origin lies on one side of it.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Midpoint of \\((0,0)\\) and \\((3,1)\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\left( \\frac{0 + 3}{2}, \\frac{0 + 1}{2} \\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n- **Slope of the Line Connecting \\((0,0)\\) and \\((3,1)\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1 - 0}{3 - 0} = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Slope of the Perpendicular Bisector:**\n  Negative reciprocal is \\(-3\\).\n\n- **Equation of the Perpendicular Bisector:**\n  Using point-slope form:\n  \\[\n  y - \\frac{1}{2} = -3\\left(x - \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n  \n  Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  y - \\frac{1}{2} = -3x + \\frac{9}{2} \\implies y = -3x + 5\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute! The perpendicular bisector's equation \\( y = -3x + 5 \\) aligns with the inequality \\( 3x + y < 5 \\). This confirms that both strategies lead to the same boundary, reinforcing the correctness of our approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determining the Region\u2014Combining Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWith both strategies confirming the boundary, let's identify the area within the rectangle where \\( 3x + y < 5 \\). This region is a trapezoid.\n\n**Next Steps:**  \nCalculate the area of the trapezoidal region to determine the probability.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Vertices of the Trapezoid:**\n  \\[\n  (0,0), \\left(\\frac{5}{3}, 0\\right), \\left(\\frac{4}{3}, 1\\right), (0,1)\n  \\]\n\n- **Area of the Rectangle:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Length} = 2,\\ \\text{Width} = 1 \\implies \\text{Area} = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n  \\]\n\n- **Area of the Trapezoid:**\n  Bases are \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\), height is 1.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\left(\\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{4}{3}\\right) \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{9}{3} = \\frac{3}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**Probability Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Area of Trapezoid}}{\\text{Area of Rectangle}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{2} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis calculation suggests that 75% of the rectangle's area is closer to the origin. Given that the point \\((3,1)\\) lies outside the rectangle, this probability seems reasonable.\n\n**Check:**  \nLet's consider extreme points within the rectangle:\n\n- **At the Origin \\((0,0)\\):**  \n  Clearly closer to itself.\n\n- **At \\((2,1)\\):**  \n  Still closer to the origin since \\((3,1)\\) is further away.\n\nThese checks align with our solution, confirming its correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n\\]\nThe probability that a randomly selected point \\( P \\) within the rectangle is closer to the origin than to \\((3,1)\\) is **0.75** or **75%**.\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Recap and Reflection**\n\n**Summarizing the Approach:**\n\n1. **Brainstorming and Strategy Selection:**  \n   - Started with direct distance comparison.\n   - Considered visualizing the problem using the perpendicular bisector for confirmation.\n\n2. **Setting Up and Solving the Inequality:**  \n   - Derived \\( 3x + y < 5 \\) to define the region closer to the origin.\n\n3. **Visualizing and Validating the Region:**  \n   - Identified the trapezoidal area within the rectangle satisfying the inequality.\n\n4. **Calculating the Probability:**  \n   - Computed the area of the trapezoid relative to the rectangle, yielding a probability of 0.75.\n\n5. **Checking and Confirming the Solution:**  \n   - Conducted sanity checks with specific points to ensure correctness.\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nBy embracing a natural, human approach\u2014starting with brainstorming, exploring multiple strategies, and continuously reflecting and checking for accuracy\u2014we arrived at a robust and correct solution. This process not only ensured correctness but also deepened our understanding of the problem, allowing us to confidently determine the probability as **0.75**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThrough methodical brainstorming, strategic exploration, and diligent verification, we've accurately determined that the probability of a randomly selected point within the rectangle being closer to the origin than to \\((3,1)\\) is **75%**. This human-centric approach highlights the importance of flexibility and reflection in problem-solving, ensuring both correctness and clarity.",
  "ground_truth": "The area of the rectangular region is 2. Hence the probability that $P$ is closer to $(0,0)$ than it is to $(3,1)$ is half the area of the trapezoid bounded by the lines $y=1$, the $x$- and $y$-axes, and the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining $(0,0)$ and $(3,1)$. The perpendicular bisector goes through the point $(3/2,1/2)$, which is the center of the square whose vertices are $(1,0), (2,0), (2,1), \\text{ and\n}(1,1)$. Hence, the line cuts the square  into two quadrilaterals of equal  area $1/2$. Thus the area of the trapezoid is $3/2$ and the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((-1,0)--(4,0),Arrow);\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,3),Arrow);\nfor (int i=0; i<4; ++i) {\ndraw((i,-0.2)--(i,0.2));\n}\nfor (int i=0; i<3; ++i) {\ndraw((-0.2,i)--(0.2,i));\n}\nlabel(\"$x$\",(3.7,0),S);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,2.7),W);\nlabel(\"1\",(1,-0.2),S);\nlabel(\"2\",(2,-0.2),S);\nlabel(\"3\",(3,-0.2),S);\nlabel(\"1\",(-0.2,1),W);\nlabel(\"2\",(-0.2,2),W);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((1,2)--(2,-1),linewidth(0.7));\ndot((1.5,0.5));\ndot((3,1));\ndraw((1,0)--(1,1.3),dashed);\ndraw((1.5,0.5)--(1.7,1.5));\nlabel(\"($\\frac{3}{2}$,$\\frac{1}{2}$)\",(1.7,1.5),N);\ndraw((0,1)--(2,1)--(2,0),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$(3,1)$\",(3,1),N);\n[/asy]"
