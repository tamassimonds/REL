  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into this problem. I need to find the number of ways to write \\(2010\\) as:\n\n\\[\n2010 = a_3 \\cdot 10^3 + a_2 \\cdot 10^2 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0\n\\]\n\nwhere each \\(a_i\\) is an integer between 0 and 99. \n\n### First Thoughts\n\n- **This feels like** decomposing a number into powers of ten with larger coefficients than usual.\n- **Reminds me of** problems involving number representations with constraints.\n- **But wait**, unlike standard base 10, where digits are 0\u20139, here each digit can be up to 99. That's different!\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Digital Representation:** Try to express 2010 using powers of ten with coefficients up to 99.\n2. **Combinatorial Approach:** Count valid combinations of coefficients.\n3. **Recursion or Dynamic Programming:** Use patterns or previous computations to build up.\n\nI'll start with the **Digital Representation** strategy since it seems straightforward. If that doesn't work, I'll explore other options.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Exploring Digital Representation\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's express \\(2010\\) as:\n\n\\[\n2010 = a_3 \\cdot 1000 + a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0\n\\]\n\nwith \\(0 \\le a_i \\le 99\\).\n\n**Initial Idea:**\n\n- **Find coefficients** \\(a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0\\) such that their weighted sum equals 2010.\n- **Sounds like** solving a system of equations.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, if I try to solve for each coefficient sequentially, it might get messy. Maybe I need a systematic way to ensure all coefficients are within the given range.\n\n**Proceeding Anyway:**\n\nLet\u2019s attempt to find one set of coefficients to see if it helps.\n\n---\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Start with the largest power (\\(10^3\\)):**\n\n   \\[\n   a_3 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2010}{1000} \\right\\rfloor = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the contribution of \\(a_3\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remainder} = 2010 - 2 \\cdot 1000 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find \\(a_2\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   a_2 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{100} \\right\\rfloor = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the contribution of \\(a_2\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remainder} = 10 - 0 \\cdot 100 = 10\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find \\(a_1\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   a_1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n   \\]\n\n6. **Subtract the contribution of \\(a_1\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remainder} = 10 - 1 \\cdot 10 = 0\n   \\]\n\n7. **Finally, \\(a_0\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   a_0 = 0\n   \\]\n\n**Result:**\n\nOne set of coefficients is \\(a_3 = 2\\), \\(a_2 = 0\\), \\(a_1 = 1\\), \\(a_0 = 0\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **This gives us** one valid representation.\n- **But the question asks for** the total number of such representations.\n\n**Wait a minute...**\n\nThis approach only finds one set of coefficients. I need a better method to count all possible combinations that satisfy the equation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe **Digital Representation** strategy helps find one solution but doesn't efficiently count all possible solutions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Considering a Combinatorial Approach\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe I can think of this as a combinatorics problem where I need to count the number of ways to distribute the total sum among the coefficients, respecting their limits.\n\n**Initial Idea:**\n\n- **Use generating functions** or **stars and bars** method to count combinations.\n- **But since each coefficient has an upper limit**, I need to account for that.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis sounds promising but might get complicated due to the upper limit on each coefficient. Still, it's worth exploring.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\nLet's try to set up the problem using combinatorics.\n\n**Setup:**\n\nI need to find all sets \\((a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0)\\) such that:\n\n\\[\na_3 \\cdot 1000 + a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = 2010\n\\]\n\nwith \\(0 \\le a_i \\le 99\\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Each coefficient contributes** a multiple of a power of ten.\n- **The sum must equal 2010,** so I need to find all combinations that satisfy this.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Fix \\(a_3\\):**\n\n   - Since \\(a_3 \\cdot 1000\\) must be less than or equal to 2010, \n\n     \\[\n     a_3 \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2010}{1000} \\right\\rfloor = 2\n     \\]\n\n   - So, \\(a_3\\) can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n2. **For each \\(a_3\\), compute the remainder:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Remainder} = 2010 - a_3 \\cdot 1000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Then, find \\(a_2, a_1, a_0\\)** such that:\n\n   \\[\n   a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = \\text{Remainder}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Repeat for each valid \\(a_3\\):**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach requires iterating over possible values of \\(a_3\\) and then finding corresponding values of \\(a_2, a_1, a_0\\). It's more systematic but still seems labor-intensive.\n\n**Checking:**\n\nLet's see if it's feasible to enumerate all possibilities this way.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Implementing the Combinatorial Approach\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI'll create a list of possible values for \\(a_3\\) and, for each, compute the remaining sum to be distributed among \\(a_2, a_1, a_0\\).\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n1. **Case 1: \\(a_3 = 0\\)**\n\n   - Remainder = 2010\n   - Need to solve: \n\n     \\[\n     a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = 2010\n     \\]\n\n   - **Check if possible:**\n\n     - Maximum \\(a_2 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2010}{100} \\right\\rfloor = 20\\)\n     - But \\(a_2 \\le 99\\), so it's fine.\n\n2. **Case 2: \\(a_3 = 1\\)**\n\n   - Remainder = 2010 - 1000 = 1010\n   - Need to solve:\n\n     \\[\n     a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = 1010\n     \\]\n\n3. **Case 3: \\(a_3 = 2\\)**\n\n   - Remainder = 2010 - 2000 = 10\n   - Need to solve:\n\n     \\[\n     a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = 10\n     \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFor each case, I need to count the number of valid combinations of \\(a_2, a_1, a_0\\) that sum to the remainder.\n\n**But wait...**\n\nThis still seems like a lot of manual work. Maybe there's a better way to automate counting these combinations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe **Combinatorial Approach** is more systematic but still not efficient for manual calculation. I need a more refined method.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Introducing Constraints and Simplifying the Problem\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's reconsider the constraints: \\(0 \\le a_i \\le 99\\). This means each coefficient can be as large as 99, which is much larger than the usual single-digit coefficients in base 10.\n\n**Initial Idea:**\n\n- **Maybe I can treat this as** a modified base-10 system where each \"digit\" can be up to 99.\n- **Or possibly use** a computational approach to iterate over possible values.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis still sounds complicated. Perhaps I need to think of a different strategy.\n\n**Wait a minute...**\n\nMaybe I can **reframe the problem** by considering how to distribute the total sum \\(2010\\) among the coefficients with the given constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Reframing the Problem Using Inequalities\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's set up inequalities based on the constraints:\n\n\\[\n2010 = a_3 \\cdot 1000 + a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0\n\\]\n\nwith \\(0 \\le a_i \\le 99\\).\n\n**Initial Idea:**\n\n- **Consider the maximum and minimum values** each coefficient can take.\n- **Use inequalities** to narrow down the possible values of each coefficient.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis might help reduce the number of cases I need to consider.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n1. **Maximum value when all \\(a_i = 99\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   99 \\cdot 1000 + 99 \\cdot 100 + 99 \\cdot 10 + 99 = 999999\n   \\]\n\n   - **But 2010 is much smaller,** so not all coefficients can be 99.\n\n2. **Minimum value when all \\(a_i = 0\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n   - **Obviously, we need to find valid combinations in between.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis doesn't immediately help in counting the number of valid combinations. I need a more structured approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe **Inequalities Approach** provides some insights but doesn't directly lead to a solution. Time to think differently.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Shifting to a Better Strategy - Summation Approach\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nPerhaps I can **express the problem as a summation** where the coefficients\u2019 weighted sums equal 2010, and then count the number of ways to achieve this sum under the given constraints.\n\n**Initial Idea:**\n\n- **Use an algorithmic approach** to iterate over possible values of coefficients and count valid combinations.\n- **Assign variables** to represent the coefficients and their contributions.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nGiven the constraints, this might still be computationally expensive, but it's worth trying.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\nLet's formalize the problem:\n\n\\[\na_3 \\cdot 1000 + a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = 2010\n\\]\n\nwith \\(0 \\le a_i \\le 99\\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Fix one coefficient at a time** and compute the possible values for the remaining coefficients.\n- **Count all combinations** that satisfy the equation.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Fix \\(a_3\\):**\n\n   - For \\(a_3 = 0\\): \n\n     \\[\n     a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = 2010\n     \\]\n\n     - **But \\(a_2\\) can only be up to 99,** so this case has no solutions.\n\n   - For \\(a_3 = 1\\):\n\n     \\[\n     a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = 1010\n     \\]\n\n     - **Need to find all \\((a_2, a_1, a_0)\\)** combinations that sum to 1010.\n\n   - For \\(a_3 = 2\\):\n\n     \\[\n     a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = 10\n     \\]\n\n     - **Need to find all \\((a_2, a_1, a_0)\\)** combinations that sum to 10.\n\n2. **Counting Valid Combinations:**\n\n   - **For \\(a_3 = 1\\):**\n   \n     - **Find all \\(a_2\\) such that** \n       \n       \\[\n       a_2 \\cdot 100 \\le 1010\n       \\]\n       \n     - Maximum \\(a_2 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1010}{100} \\right\\rfloor = 10\\).\n     \n     - For each valid \\(a_2\\), compute the remainder and find corresponding \\(a_1, a_0\\).\n\n   - **For \\(a_3 = 2\\):**\n   \n     - Maximum \\(a_2 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{100} \\right\\rfloor = 0\\).\n     \n     - So, only one combination: \n       \n       \\[\n       a_2 = 0, a_1 = 1, a_0 = 0\n       \\]\n       \n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach is more systematic and feasible. It allows me to count the number of valid combinations by fixing one coefficient at a time and calculating the possible values for the remaining coefficients.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe **Summation Approach** seems promising. Let's proceed with it.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Detailing the Summation Approach\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's break down the problem by fixing \\(a_3\\) and then counting the valid combinations of \\(a_2, a_1, a_0\\) for each case.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n1. **Case 1: \\(a_3 = 0\\)**\n\n   - Equation:\n   \n     \\[\n     a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = 2010\n     \\]\n     \n   - **But \\(a_2\\) can only be up to 99,** so this case has no solutions.\n\n2. **Case 2: \\(a_3 = 1\\)**\n\n   - Equation:\n   \n     \\[\n     a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = 1010\n     \\]\n     \n   - **Need to find all \\((a_2, a_1, a_0)\\)** combinations that sum to 1010.\n\n3. **Case 3: \\(a_3 = 2\\)**\n\n   - Equation:\n   \n     \\[\n     a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = 10\n     \\]\n     \n   - **Need to find all \\((a_2, a_1, a_0)\\)** combinations that sum to 10.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet's focus on Case 2 and Case 3, as Case 1 has no solutions.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\nLet's count the number of valid combinations for each case.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Counting Valid Combinations for Case 2 (\\(a_3 = 1\\))\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFor \\(a_3 = 1\\), we have:\n\n\\[\na_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = 1010\n\\]\n\nwith \\(0 \\le a_i \\le 99\\).\n\n**Initial Idea:**\n\n- **Iterate over all possible values of \\(a_2\\)** and, for each, find the corresponding values of \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_0\\).\n- **Ensure that \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_0\\)** satisfy the remaining equation.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis is a straightforward approach. Let's proceed with it.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n1. **Iterate over \\(a_2\\):**\n   \n   - **Maximum \\(a_2 = 10\\)** because \n     \n     \\[\n     10 \\cdot 100 = 1000 \\le 1010\n     \\]\n     \n2. **For each \\(a_2\\), compute the remainder:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Remainder} = 1010 - a_2 \\cdot 100\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Find \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_0\\) such that:**\n   \n   \\[\n   a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = \\text{Remainder}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Ensure \\(0 \\le a_1, a_0 \\le 99\\):**\n   \n   - **Given the remainders,** this condition should be satisfied.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's enumerate the valid combinations.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\na_2 & \\text{Remainder} & a_1 & a_0 & \\text{Valid Combination?} \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 1010 & - & - & \\text{Invalid} \\\\\n1 & 910 & 91 & 0 & \\text{Valid} \\\\\n2 & 810 & 81 & 0 & \\text{Valid} \\\\\n3 & 710 & 71 & 0 & \\text{Valid} \\\\\n4 & 610 & 61 & 0 & \\text{Valid} \\\\\n5 & 510 & 51 & 0 & \\text{Valid} \\\\\n6 & 410 & 41 & 0 & \\text{Valid} \\\\\n7 & 310 & 31 & 0 & \\text{Valid} \\\\\n8 & 210 & 21 & 0 & \\text{Valid} \\\\\n9 & 110 & 11 & 0 & \\text{Valid} \\\\\n10 & 10 & 1 & 0 & \\text{Valid} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **There are 10 valid combinations** for \\(a_2\\) from 1 to 10.\n- **For each \\(a_2\\),** \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_0\\) are uniquely determined and within the allowed range.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFor **Case 2 (\\(a_3 = 1\\))**, there are **10 valid combinations**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Counting Valid Combinations for Case 3 (\\(a_3 = 2\\))\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFor \\(a_3 = 2\\), we have:\n\n\\[\na_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = 10\n\\]\n\nwith \\(0 \\le a_i \\le 99\\).\n\n**Initial Idea:**\n\n- **Given the small remainder (10),** \\(a_2\\) must be 0 because any higher value would exceed 10.\n- **Therefore, only \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_0\\)** contribute to the sum.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly.

  "ground_truth": "If we choose $a_3$ and $a_1$ such that $(10^3)(a_3) + (10)(a_1) \\leq 2010$ there is a unique choice of $a_2$ and $a_0$ that makes the equality hold. So $N$ is just the number of combinations of $a_3$ and $a_1$ we can pick. If $a_3 = 0$ or $a_3 = 1$ we can let $a_1$ be anything from $0$ to $99$. If $a_3 = 2$ then $a_1 = 0$ or $a_1 = 1$. Thus $N = 100 + 100 + 2 = \\boxed{202}$."
