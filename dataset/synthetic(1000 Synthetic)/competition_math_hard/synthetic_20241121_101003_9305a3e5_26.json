  "problem": "If $f(x)=ax+b$ and $f^{-1}(x)=bx+a$ with $a$ and $b$ real, what is the value of $a+b$?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed until I arrive at the final solution.\n\n---\n\n### **First Impressions**\n\nOkay, the problem involves a function \\( f(x) = ax + b \\) and its inverse \\( f^{-1}(x) = bx + a \\). We're asked to find the value of \\( a + b \\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- This looks like a straightforward problem involving functions and their inverses.\n- I recall that the inverse of a linear function should also be linear, which aligns with what's given.\n- But wait, the coefficients in the inverse seem swapped and possibly problematic\u2014\\( bx + a \\) instead of the expected form.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Use the Property of Inverses:** I know that applying a function and its inverse should return the original input: \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\) and \\( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \\).\n2. **Find the Inverse Algebraically:** I could try deriving the inverse of \\( f(x) \\) to see if it matches \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) as given.\n3. **Set Up Equations:** Plug in specific values to create equations and solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Maybe I can use both strategies to cross-check my work. If one approach doesn't lead anywhere, I'll try the other.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Property of Inverses**\n\n**Step 1:** Use \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\).\n\nLet's plug \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(f^{-1}(x)) = f(bx + a) = a(bx + a) + b = abx + a^2 + b\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait a minute, this simplifies to \\( abx + a^2 + b \\). For this to equal \\( x \\), we need:\n  \\[\n  ab = 1 \\quad \\text{(coefficient of } x\\text{)}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a^2 + b = 0 \\quad \\text{(constant term)}\n  \\]\n- *Interesting! I've already got two equations relating \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).*\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Does this make sense? Yes, because for the composite function to equal \\( x \\), both the coefficient of \\( x \\) must be 1, and the constant must be 0.\n\n**Step 2:** Use \\( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \\).\n\nNow, let's do the reverse:\n\n\\[\nf^{-1}(f(x)) = f^{-1}(ax + b) = b(ax + b) + a = abx + b^2 + a\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This simplifies to \\( abx + b^2 + a \\). For this to equal \\( x \\), we need:\n  \\[\n  ab = 1 \\quad \\text{(same as before)}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  b^2 + a = 0\n  \\]\n- *Wait, now I have two sets of equations:*\n  \\[\n  a^2 + b = 0 \\quad \\text{(from Step 1)}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  b^2 + a = 0 \\quad \\text{(from Step 2)}\n  \\]\n- *This seems consistent, so I think I'm on the right track.*\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- With these two equations, I can solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the Equations**\n\n**Step 3:** Write down the equations.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 + b &= 0 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)} \\\\\nb^2 + a &= 0 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)} \\\\\nab &= 1 \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- I have three equations and two unknowns, which should be sufficient to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n- *But the equations are nonlinear, so I'll need to be careful.*\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\) using Equation 1, then substitute into Equation 2 or Equation 3 to find \\( a \\).\n\n**Step 4:** Solve Equation 1 for \\( b \\).\n\n\\[\nb = -a^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- *This substitution should simplify the other equations.*\n\n**Step 5:** Substitute \\( b = -a^2 \\) into Equation 3.\n\n\\[\na(-a^2) = 1 \\implies -a^3 = 1 \\implies a = -1\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Does this value satisfy Equation 1 and Equation 2?\n  \\[\n  a^2 + b = 1 + (-1) = 0 \\quad \\text{(satisfied)}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  b^2 + a = 1 + (-1) = 0 \\quad \\text{(satisfied)}\n  \\]\n- *Yes, it works!*\n\n**Step 6:** Find \\( b \\) using \\( a = -1 \\).\n\n\\[\nb = -(-1)^2 = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So, \\( a = -1 \\) and \\( b = -1 \\).\n- *Now, let's find \\( a + b \\):*\n  \\[\n  a + b = -1 + (-1) = -2\n  \\]\n- *This seems consistent with the equations I've derived.*\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Is there another strategy to verify this result? Maybe using Strategy 2.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Finding the Inverse Algebraically**\n\n**Step 7:** Find the inverse of \\( f(x) = ax + b \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find the inverse, I'll solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) where \\( y = f(x) \\).\n- So, start with:\n  \\[\n  y = ax + b\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y - b = ax\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{y - b}{a}\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the inverse function should be:\n  \\[\n  f^{-1}(y) = \\frac{y - b}{a}\n  \\]\n- *But the given inverse is \\( f^{-1}(x) = bx + a \\), which doesn't match unless specific conditions on \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are met.*\n\n**Reflection:**\n- *This discrepancy suggests that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must satisfy certain relationships to make both expressions equivalent.*\n\n**Step 8:** Set the two expressions for the inverse equal.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x - b}{a} = bx + a\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Cross-multiply to eliminate the denominator:\n  \\[\n  x - b = abx + a^2\n  \\]\n- Rearrange to bring all terms involving \\( x \\) to one side:\n  \\[\n  x - abx = a^2 + b\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x(1 - ab) = a^2 + b\n  \\]\n- *For this equation to hold for all \\( x \\), the coefficient of \\( x \\) must be zero, and the constant term must also be zero.*\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This leads to:\n  \\[\n  1 - ab = 0 \\implies ab = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a^2 + b = 0\n  \\]\n- *Wait, these are the same equations I derived earlier using Strategy 1. This consistency reinforces that the solution is correct.*\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Since both strategies lead to the same set of equations, I'm confident in proceeding with solving them.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Step 9:** Verify the solution.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- With \\( a = -1 \\) and \\( b = -1 \\):\n  \\[\n  ab = (-1)(-1) = 1 \\quad \\text{(satisfied)}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a^2 + b = 1 + (-1) = 0 \\quad \\text{(satisfied)}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  b^2 + a = 1 + (-1) = 0 \\quad \\text{(satisfied)}\n  \\]\n- *All original equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.*\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The value of \\( a + b = -2 \\) aligns with all the conditions set by the problem.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Is there any other method to verify this? Perhaps by plugging back into the original functions.\n\n**Step 10:** Substitute back into the original functions.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's check if \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) work as expected with \\( a = -1 \\) and \\( b = -1 \\).\n\n\\[\nf(x) = -x - 1\n\\]\n\\[\nf^{-1}(x) = -x - 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Compute \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) \\):\n  \\[\n  f(f^{-1}(x)) = f(-x - 1) = -(-x - 1) - 1 = x + 1 - 1 = x\n  \\]\n- Compute \\( f^{-1}(f(x)) \\):\n  \\[\n  f^{-1}(f(x)) = f^{-1}(-x - 1) = -(-x - 1) - 1 = x + 1 - 1 = x\n  \\]\n- *Both compositions return \\( x \\), confirming that the functions are indeed inverses.*\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This confirms that the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter thoroughly exploring multiple strategies and verifying each step, the final solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2}\n\\]\n\n**Narrative Re-cap:**\n- **Initially**, I considered using the property of inverses, which led me to a set of equations relating \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n- **Solving these equations** gave me \\( a = -1 \\) and \\( b = -1 \\), resulting in \\( a + b = -2 \\).\n- **To verify**, I employed an alternative strategy by finding the inverse algebraically, which corroborated the initial findings.\n- **Finally**, a substitution back into the original functions confirmed the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- Approaching the problem with multiple strategies ensured the accuracy of the solution.\n- Regular checks and validations helped in catching any potential errors early on.\n- The consistency between different methods reinforced the confidence in the final answer.\n\nAnd that's it! By methodically exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying the results, I've confidently arrived at the correct solution: \\( a + b = -2 \\).",
  "ground_truth": "Since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$, it follows that $a(bx+a)+b=x$, which implies $abx + a^2 +b = x$. This equation holds for all values of $x$ only if $ab=1$ and $a^2+b=0$.\n\nThen $b = -a^2$.  Substituting into the equation $ab = 1$, we get $-a^3 = 1$.  Then $a = -1$, so $b = -1$, and  \\[f(x)=-x-1.\\]Likewise  \\[f^{-1}(x)=-x-1.\\]These are inverses to one another since  \\[f(f^{-1}(x))=-(-x-1)-1=x+1-1=x.\\]\\[f^{-1}(f(x))=-(-x-1)-1=x+1-1=x.\\]Therefore $a+b=\\boxed{-2}$."
