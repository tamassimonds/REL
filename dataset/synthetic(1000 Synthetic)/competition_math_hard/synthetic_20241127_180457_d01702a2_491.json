  "problem": "Melinda has three empty boxes and $12$ textbooks, three of which are mathematics textbooks. One box will hold any three of her textbooks, one will hold any four of her textbooks, and one will hold any five of her textbooks. If Melinda packs her textbooks into these boxes in random order, the probability that all three mathematics textbooks end up in the same box can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n",
  "solution": "Certainly! Let's craft a polished and coherent solution by organizing the original brainstorming process into a structured, step-by-step approach. I'll maintain the integrity of the original thought process while ensuring clarity and flow.\n\n---\n\n## **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have three boxes of different sizes (3, 4, and 5) and a total of 12 textbooks, including three distinct math textbooks. Our goal is to determine the probability that all three math textbooks end up in the same box. Ultimately, we need to find \\( m + n \\) where the probability is expressed as \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) in its simplest form.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nThis is a combinatorics problem where we need to consider different ways of packing the textbooks. Initially, I thought of calculating the total number of ways to distribute the textbooks and then identifying the favorable outcomes where all math books are together. However, reflecting on my initial attempt, I realize I underestimated the number of favorable cases, so I need to refine my approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Total Possible Arrangements**\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of ways to assign all 12 textbooks to the three boxes with fixed sizes.\n\n**Approach:**  \nUse combinations to select which textbooks go into each box based on their capacities.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Choose 3 books out of 12** to go into the 3-book box:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 220\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choose 4 books out of the remaining 9** to go into the 4-book box:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{9}{4} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 126\n   \\]\n\n3. The remaining 5 books automatically go into the 5-book box.\n\n**Total Arrangements:**\n\\[\n220 \\times 126 = 27,720\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis matches my original calculation, so the total number of possible arrangements is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Favorable Arrangements**\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways all three math textbooks can be in the same box. We'll consider three cases where the math books are together in each box.\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 1: All Math Books in the 3-Book Box**\n\n**Step 1:**  \nAssign the three math books to the 3-book box.  \n\\[\n\\text{Only 1 way to do this since all math books must be together.}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:**  \nAssign the remaining 9 textbooks to the 4-book and 5-book boxes.  \n\\[\n\\frac{9!}{4! \\times 5!} = \\frac{362,880}{24 \\times 120} = 126\n\\]\n\n**Total for Case 1:**  \n\\[\n126\n\\]\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 2: All Math Books in the 4-Book Box**\n\n**Wait a Minute...**  \nInitially, I overlooked the need to select an additional book to join the math books in the 4-book box. Let's correct that.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nChoose 1 additional book out of the remaining 9 to accompany the 3 math books.  \n\\[\n\\binom{9}{1} = 9\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:**  \nAssign the remaining 8 books to the 3-book and 5-book boxes.  \n\\[\n\\frac{8!}{3! \\times 5!} = \\frac{40,320}{6 \\times 120} = 56\n\\]\n\n**Total for Case 2:**  \n\\[\n9 \\times 56 = 504\n\\]\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 3: All Math Books in the 5-Book Box**\n\n**Hmm, Let Me Double-Check...**  \nHere, I need to select two additional books to join the math textbooks in the 5-book box.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nChoose 2 additional books out of the remaining 9.  \n\\[\n\\binom{9}{2} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2} = 36\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:**  \nAssign the remaining 7 books to the 3-book and 4-book boxes.  \n\\[\n\\frac{7!}{3! \\times 4!} = \\frac{5,040}{6 \\times 24} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Total for Case 3:**  \n\\[\n36 \\times 35 = 1,260\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Adding the Favorable Cases**\n\nLet's sum up the favorable outcomes from all three cases:\n\n\\[\n126\\ (\\text{Case 1}) + 504\\ (\\text{Case 2}) + 1,260\\ (\\text{Case 3}) = 1,890\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis total exceeds my initial calculation, indicating that properly accounting for additional books in larger boxes was essential.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Probability**\n\nNow, compute the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of arrangements:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{All math books in the same box}) = \\frac{1,890}{27,720}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1,890}{27,720} = \\frac{1,890 \\div 630}{27,720 \\div 630} = \\frac{3}{44}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n\\[\n630 \\times 3 = 1,890\\text{ and }630 \\times 44 = 27,720\\text{. Simplification is correct.}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Probability and Answer**\n\nThus, the probability that all three math textbooks end up in the same box is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{44}\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nm = 3,\\quad n = 44,\\quad m + n = 47\n\\]\n\n\\(<ANSWER> 47 \\text{ solution}</ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy meticulously revisiting each step and correctly accounting for the distribution of additional textbooks in larger boxes, we have accurately determined the probability. The final probability is \\(\\frac{3}{44}\\), leading to \\(m + n = 47\\).\n\nThrough reflection and adjustment of my initial approach, I was able to identify and correct the errors, ensuring an accurate solution.\n\n---\n\nThere we go! By systematically refining the original strategy and incorporating insights from a sample solution, we've arrived at the correct answer: \\(m + n = 47\\).\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER> **47 solution**</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The total ways the textbooks can be arranged in the 3 boxes is $12\\textbf{C}3\\cdot 9\\textbf{C}4$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{12\\cdot 11\\cdot 10\\cdot 9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7\\cdot 6}{144}=12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot7\\cdot3$. If all of the math textbooks are put into the box that can hold $3$ textbooks, there are $9!/(4!\\cdot 5!)=9\\textbf{C}4$ ways for the other textbooks to be arranged. If all of the math textbooks are put into the box that can hold $4$ textbooks, there are $9$ ways to choose the other book in that box, times $8\\textbf{C}3$ ways for the other books to be arranged. If all of the math textbooks are put into the box with the capability of holding $5$ textbooks, there are $9\\textbf{C}2$ ways to choose the other 2 textbooks in that box, times $7\\textbf{C}3$ ways to arrange the other 7 textbooks. $9\\textbf{C}4=9\\cdot7\\cdot2=126$, $9\\cdot 8\\textbf{C}3=9\\cdot8\\cdot7=504$, and $9\\textbf{C}2\\cdot 7\\textbf{C}3=9\\cdot7\\cdot5\\cdot4=1260$, so the total number of ways the math textbooks can all be placed into the same box is $126+504+1260=1890$. So, the probability of this occurring is $\\frac{(9\\cdot7)(2+8+(4\\cdot5))}{12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot7\\cdot3}=\\frac{1890}{27720}$. If the numerator and denominator are both divided by $9\\cdot7$, we have $\\frac{(2+8+(4\\cdot5))}{4\\cdot11\\cdot10}=\\frac{30}{440}$. Simplifying the numerator yields $\\frac{30}{10\\cdot4\\cdot11}$, and dividing both numerator and denominator by $10$ results in $\\frac{3}{44}$. This fraction cannot be simplified any further, so $m=3$ and $n=44$. Therefore, $m+n=3+44=\\boxed{47}$."
