    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I would approach it if I were working on it manually. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step to ensure correctness, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n### **Problem Statement**\n\nA scalene triangle has side lengths which are prime numbers, and the length of its perimeter is also prime. What is its smallest possible perimeter?\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with a scalene triangle (all sides are different) with side lengths that are prime numbers. Additionally, the perimeter must also be a prime number. The goal is to find the smallest possible perimeter that satisfies these conditions.\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n- **List Prime Numbers:** Since side lengths must be prime, I should start by listing the smallest prime numbers.\n- **Triangle Inequality:** To form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.\n- **Scalene Condition:** All three sides must be different prime numbers.\n- **Perimeter Prime:** The sum of the three side lengths must also be a prime number.\n\nThese conditions seem straightforward, but I need to ensure that all are satisfied simultaneously.\n\n### **Step 1: Listing the Smallest Prime Numbers**\n\nLet's start by listing the smallest prime numbers:\n\n2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Prime numbers are the building blocks here.\n- Since triangles have three sides, I'll need to consider combinations of three different primes.\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Combinations of Three Different Primes**\n\nGiven the scalene condition, I'll need to select three distinct prime numbers. Let's start with the smallest primes and work our way up.\n\n**Combination 1: 2, 3, 5**\n\n- **Perimeter:** 2 + 3 + 5 = 10\n- **Check if Perimeter is Prime:** 10 is not a prime number (divisible by 2 and 5).\n- **Triangle Inequality Checks:**\n  - 2 + 3 = 5 (not greater than 5) \u2014 violates the triangle inequality.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The perimeter is not prime, and the triangle inequality is violated.\n- Using 2 as a side length might be problematic due to the triangle inequality.\n\n**Combination 2: 3, 5, 7**\n\n- **Perimeter:** 3 + 5 + 7 = 15\n- **Check if Perimeter is Prime:** 15 is not a prime number (divisible by 3 and 5).\n- **Triangle Inequality Checks:**\n  - 3 + 5 = 8 > 7 \u2714\ufe0f\n  - 3 + 7 = 10 > 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n  - 5 + 7 = 12 > 3 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The triangle inequality is satisfied, but the perimeter is not prime.\n- Need to try a different combination to achieve a prime perimeter.\n\n**Combination 3: 3, 5, 11**\n\n- **Perimeter:** 3 + 5 + 11 = 19\n- **Check if Perimeter is Prime:** 19 is a prime number.\n- **Triangle Inequality Checks:**\n  - 3 + 5 = 8 > 11 \u274c (violates the triangle inequality)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Even though the perimeter is prime, the triangle inequality is violated.\n- Need to find a combination where all conditions are satisfied.\n\n### **Step 3: Adjusting Strategy**\n\nSince using the smallest primes isn't working due to triangle inequality violations, perhaps I need to consider slightly larger primes or different combinations.\n\n**Combination 4: 5, 7, 11**\n\n- **Perimeter:** 5 + 7 + 11 = 23\n- **Check if Perimeter is Prime:** 23 is a prime number.\n- **Triangle Inequality Checks:**\n  - 5 + 7 = 12 > 11 \u2714\ufe0f\n  - 5 + 11 = 16 > 7 \u2714\ufe0f\n  - 7 + 11 = 18 > 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- All conditions are satisfied:\n  - The side lengths are different prime numbers.\n  - The perimeter is prime.\n  - The triangle inequality is satisfied.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Smallest Possible Perimeter?** Before concluding, let's ensure that this is indeed the smallest possible perimeter by considering whether a smaller combination is possible.\n- **Attempt with Smaller Primes:** As seen earlier, combinations involving smaller primes either violate the triangle inequality or result in a non-prime perimeter.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Combination Used:** 5, 7, 11\n- **Perimeter:** 23 (prime)\n- **Triangle Inequality:** Satisfied for all pairs of sides.\n- **Conclusion:** This is the smallest possible perimeter that satisfies all conditions.",

  "ground_truth": "The first few prime numbers are: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,\\ldots$.  Since the triangle is scalene, all the sides are different primes.\n\nIf one side is 2, then the other two sides must be odd.  Then the perimeter of the triangle would be even.  But the perimeter must also be greater than 2, so it cannot be prime.  This means that none of the sides can be 2.\n\nNow, suppose one side is 3.  Let the other two sides be $p$ and $q,$ where $p < q.$  Since all the sides are different,\n\\[3 < p < q.\\]Also, by the Triangle Inequality, $p + 3 > q,$ so\n\\[p > q - 3.\\]Since $p < q,$ the only possible values of $p$ are $q - 2$ and $q - 1.$\n\nSince $p$ is a prime greater than 3, $p$ is odd.  If $p = q - 1,$ then $q = p + 1$ is even, which means $q$ is not prime.  Therefore, $p = q - 2,$ or\n\\[q = p + 2.\\]As a number, $p$ must be of the form $3k,$ $3k + 1,$ or $3k + 2.$  Since $p$ is prime, $p$ cannot be of the form $3k.$  If $p = 3k + 1,$ then $q = p + 2 = 3k + 3 = 3(k + 1),$ which is not prime.  Therefore, $p = 3k + 2.$  Then $q = p + 2 = 3k + 4,$ and the perimeter of the triangle is\n\\[p + q + 3 = (3k + 2) + (3k + 4) + 3 = 6k + 9 = 3(2k + 3).\\]Since this is divisible by 3, the perimeter cannot be prime.  This tells us that none of the sides can be equal to 3 either.\n\nNote that $5 + 7 + 11 = 23$ is prime, so the smallest possible perimeter is $\\boxed{23}.$"
