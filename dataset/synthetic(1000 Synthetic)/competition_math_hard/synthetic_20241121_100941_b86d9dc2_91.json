  "solution": "### **Exploring the Domain of \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \\rfloor} \\)**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We're asked to find the domain of the function:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \\rfloor}\n\\]\n\n**First Impressions:**\n\n- **Floor Function in Denominator:** Immediately, I notice that the denominator involves a floor function, \\(\\lfloor z \\rfloor\\), which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(z\\).\n- **Potential for Division by Zero:** This suggests that the domain will be affected by points where the denominator equals zero, as division by zero is undefined.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- **Identify Zero Denominator:** I need to find values of \\(x\\) where \\(\\lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \\rfloor = 0\\) and exclude them from the domain.\n- **Solving Inequalities:** Perhaps setting up an inequality to find where the quadratic expression inside the floor function is between 0 and 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection: Is Focusing on Zero Enough?**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Does Zero Denominator Capture All Issues?** Yes, because the only restriction here is avoiding division by zero. As long as the denominator is non-zero, the function is defined.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Proceed with Identifying Zero Points:** Focusing on where \\(\\lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \\rfloor = 0\\) is indeed the right approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying Where the Denominator is Zero**\n\nI need to find \\(x\\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\lfloor x^2 - 7x + 13 \\rfloor = 0\n\\]\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n\\[\n0 \\leq x^2 - 7x + 13 < 1\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Set Up Inequalities:** By analyzing the range where the quadratic expression is between 0 and 1, I can find the \\(x\\) values to exclude.\n\n**Wait, Is This Correct?**\n\n- **Yes:** The floor function equals zero only when the expression inside is between 0 and 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Inequalities**\n\nLet's tackle each part of the inequality:\n\n#### **First Inequality: \\(x^2 - 7x + 13 \\geq 0\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Finding Roots:** Usually, finding where the quadratic equals zero helps understand the intervals.\n- **Quadratic Formula:** \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -7\\), and \\(c = 13\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 13 = 49 - 52 = -3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Negative Discriminant:** Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots.\n- **Conclusion:** The quadratic \\(x^2 - 7x + 13\\) is always positive for all real \\(x\\).\n\n**Is This Correct?**\n\n- **Yes:** A negative discriminant means the parabola does not touch the x-axis and is entirely above it.\n\n#### **Second Inequality: \\(x^2 - 7x + 13 < 1\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Rearrange Inequality:** Subtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 7x + 12 < 0\n\\]\n\n- **Find Roots:** Solve \\(x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0\\) to find the interval where the inequality holds.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - 48}}{2} = \\frac{7 \\pm 1}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Interval Between Roots:** The quadratic \\(x^2 - 7x + 12\\) is negative between \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = 4\\).\n- **Conclusion:** The inequality \\(x^2 - 7x + 13 < 1\\) holds for \\(3 < x < 4\\).\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**\n\n- **Yes:** Between \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = 4\\), the quadratic expression is less than 1, making the floor function zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Domain**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Exclude Problematic Interval:** Since the denominator is zero only for \\(3 < x < 4\\), these values must be excluded from the domain.\n- **Combine Findings:** The function is defined for all other real numbers.\n\n**Final Domain:**\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, 3] \\cup [4, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n**Wait, Let Me Double-Check That**\n\n- **Is There Anything Else?** No, because the only restriction is avoiding zero in the denominator, which we've accounted for.\n\n**Is This Correct?**\n\n- **Yes:** By excluding \\(3 < x < 4\\), the function remains defined everywhere else.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> (-\\infty, 3] \\cup [4, \\infty) </ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Learnings**\n\n- **Initial Approach Valid:** My initial instinct to focus on where the denominator is zero was correct.\n- **Verification:** Solving the inequalities confirmed that the only problematic interval is \\(3 < x < 4\\).\n- **Ensuring Completeness:** By checking each step and reflecting on the calculations, I ensured that no part of the domain was overlooked.\n\nThrough this step-by-step approach, by continuously reflecting and verifying each stage, I've confidently determined the domain of the function:\n\n\\(<ANSWER> (-\\infty, 3] \\cup [4, \\infty) </ANSWER>\\)",
  "ground_truth": "The discriminant of the quadratic is $7^2-4(13)=-3<0$, so the quadratic has no real roots and is always positive for real inputs.  The function is undefined if $0\\leq x^2-7x+13<1$, since $\\lfloor x^2-7x+13 \\rfloor = 0$ in that case. Since the quadratic is always positive, we consider the inequality $x^2-7x+13<1$.\n\nTo find when $x^2-7x+13=1$, subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $x^2-7x+12=0$ and factor as $(x-3)(x-4)=0$, so $x=3$ or $x=4$.  The parabola $x^2-7x+12$ is negative between these points, so we must exclude the interval $(3,4)$ from the domain. So the domain of $f$ is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,3] \\cup [4,\\infty)}$."
