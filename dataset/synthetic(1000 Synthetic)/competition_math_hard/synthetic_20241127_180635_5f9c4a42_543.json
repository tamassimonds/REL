  "problem": "Stan drove 300 miles in 5 hours, 20 minutes. Next, he drove 360 miles in 6 hours, 40 minutes. What was Stan's average speed in miles per hour for the total trip?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it myself. It's essential to brainstorm, reflect, and verify each part of the process to ensure accuracy. Here's how I'd approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, Stan drove two different legs of a trip, each with distinct distances and times. The goal is to find his average speed over the entire trip. Immediately, this reminds me of weighted averages since the two segments have different durations and distances. But hmm... do I need to calculate the speed for each leg separately and then combine them? Or is there a more straightforward method? Let me think\u2014perhaps calculating the total distance and total time first might simplify things. Still, I'm not entirely sure. Let's explore different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate Average Speed for Each Leg and Then Average Them:**\n\n   - **Idea:** Find the speed for the first and second legs separately, then take the average of these two speeds.\n\n   - **Reflection:** But wait, averaging the speeds directly might not account for the different times spent on each leg. This could lead to an incorrect overall average. So, maybe this isn't the best approach.\n\n2. **Compute Total Distance and Total Time:**\n\n   - **Idea:** Add up the total miles driven, convert the total time into a consistent unit (like hours), and then divide total distance by total time to get the average speed.\n\n   - **Reflection:** This seems more straightforward and likely to yield the correct average speed. Let's proceed with this method.\n\n3. **Use Weighted Average Based on Time:**\n\n   - **Idea:** Weight each leg's speed by the time spent.\n\n   - **Reflection:** This approach could work, but it seems more complicated than necessary. Since the total distance and time are easy to compute, I'll stick with the second strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Total Distance**\n\n**Thought Process:** Let's start by adding up the total miles Stan drove.\n\n- **First Leg:** 300 miles\n- **Second Leg:** 360 miles\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = 300 + 360 = 660 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Adding 300 and 360 mentally, yeah, 660 miles makes sense. So far, so good.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Total Time**\n\n**Thought Process:** Now, I need to add up the total time Stan spent driving. But the times are given in hours and minutes, so I'll need to convert everything into hours to make the calculation easier.\n\n- **First Leg:** 5 hours, 20 minutes\n- **Second Leg:** 6 hours, 40 minutes\n\n**Conversion to Hours:**\n\n- **First Leg:**\n  - 20 minutes is \\(\\frac{20}{60} = 0.333...\\) hours\n  - Total: \\(5 + 0.333... = 5.333...\\) hours\n\n- **Second Leg:**\n  - 40 minutes is \\(\\frac{40}{60} = 0.666...\\) hours\n  - Total: \\(6 + 0.666... = 6.666...\\) hours\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = 5.333... + 6.666... = 12 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Adding \\(5.333...\\) and \\(6.666...\\) should equal exactly 12 hours. Wait a minute, does that seem right? Let me double-check.\n\n**Reflection:** Yup, \\(5.333...\\) (which is \\(5\\frac{1}{3}\\)) plus \\(6.666...\\) (which is \\(6\\frac{2}{3}\\)) equals exactly 12. That checks out. Moving on.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Average Speed**\n\n**Thought Process:** Now that I have the total distance and total time, I can find the average speed using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} = \\frac{660 \\text{ miles}}{12 \\text{ hours}}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = 55 \\text{ miles per hour (mph)}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Dividing 660 by 12 mentally, yeah, 55 mph sounds correct. It\u2019s a nice round number, which is reassuring.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:** Before finalizing, let's make sure this approach makes sense. By adding up the total distance and total time and then dividing, we're effectively calculating the overall rate at which Stan drove. This method aligns with the definition of average speed.\n\n**Reflection:** No issues here. The approach is sound, and the calculations are consistent.\n\n**Alternative Strategy Check:** Remember the first strategy where I considered averaging the speeds of each leg? Since both legs had different durations, simply averaging the speeds would have skewed the result. Therefore, calculating the total distance and time was the correct path.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\mathbf{55} \\text{ miles per hour (mph)}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:** Stan's average speed for the entire trip was **55 mph**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:** I initially thought about calculating the average speed for each leg separately but realized it might not accurately reflect the overall average due to differing times.\n\n- **Preferred Strategy:** Adding total distance and total time provided a straightforward and accurate solution.\n\n- **Verification:** Regular checks throughout ensured that conversions and calculations were correct.\n\n- **Reflection:** Taking time to reconsider initial strategies helped avoid potential mistakes and led to a more efficient solution.\n\nBy allowing myself to brainstorm, reflect, and verify at each step, I ensured that the final answer was both accurate and logically derived.",
  "ground_truth": "Average speed is defined as total distance traveled divided by time traveled. In total, Stan drove 660 miles and it took him 12 hours. His average speed was $660/12=600/12+60/12=50+5=\\boxed{55}$ miles per hour."
