  "solution": "Alright, let's piece this all together into a polished, coherent solution. We'll maintain the original thought process while ensuring it's clear and concise.\n\n---\n\n## **Problem Statement**\n\nFind the sum of the different prime factors of \\(150280\\).\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen faced with finding the sum of prime factors, my initial instinct is to perform **prime factorization**\u2014decomposing the number into its prime components. However, given the size of \\(150280\\), doing this manually might seem daunting. Let's explore different strategies:\n\n- **Prime Factorization:** Break down \\(150280\\) into its prime factors.\n- **Checking Divisibility:** Start with smaller prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, etc., to see which divide \\(150280\\) evenly.\n- **Use of Algorithms or Tools:** Consider using the Euclidean algorithm or a calculator, but let's attempt manual calculations first for a deeper understanding.\n\n**Reflection:** Is prime factorization the best approach? Yes, because identifying the unique prime factors is essential to summing them up. We'll proceed with this method but remain open to adjustments if needed.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Checking Divisibility by 2**\n\nGiven that \\(150280\\) ends in 0, it's an **even number**, making it divisible by 2.\n\n\\[\n150280 \\div 2 = 75140\n\\]\n\n**Outcome:** Successfully divided by 2. The quotient is \\(75140\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Continuing to Divide by 2**\n\nSince \\(75140\\) is also even, we'll divide by 2 again.\n\n\\[\n75140 \\div 2 = 37570\n\\]\n\n**Outcome:** Again divisible by 2. The new quotient is \\(37570\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Repeating Division by 2**\n\nContinuing this process until the number is no longer even:\n\n\\[\n37570 \\div 2 = 18785\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Now, \\(18785\\) ends in 5, indicating it's no longer divisible by 2. We've extracted all factors of 2.\n\n**Prime Factors So Far:** \n\\[2\\]\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Checking Divisibility by 3**\n\nNext, let's check if \\(18785\\) is divisible by 3. To do this, sum the digits:\n\n\\[\n1 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 5 = 29\n\\]\n\nSince 29 is not divisible by 3, \\(18785\\) is **not** divisible by 3.\n\n**Outcome:** No divisibility by 3.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Checking Divisibility by 5**\n\n\\(18785\\) ends in 5, making it divisible by 5.\n\n\\[\n18785 \\div 5 = 3757\n\\]\n\n**Outcome:** Successfully divided by 5.\n\n**Prime Factors So Far:** \n\\[2, 5\\]\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Checking Divisibility of \\(3757\\) by Smaller Primes**\n\nLet's proceed with smaller primes:\n\n- **By 3:** Sum of digits \\(3 + 7 + 5 + 7 = 22\\) \u2192 Not divisible by 3.\n- **By 5:** Ends in 7 \u2192 Not divisible by 5.\n\n**Reflection:** Since \\(3757\\) is not divisible by 3 or 5, let's try the next prime, **7**.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 7: Checking Divisibility by 7**\n\n\\[\n3757 \\div 7 \\approx 536.714\n\\]\n\n**Outcome:** Not a whole number, so \\(3757\\) is **not** divisible by 7.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 8: Proceeding to Prime 11**\n\n\\[\n3757 \\div 11 \\approx 341.545\n\\]\n\n**Outcome:** Not divisible by 11.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 9: Checking Divisibility by 13**\n\n\\[\n3757 \\div 13 = 289\n\\]\n\n**Outcome:** \\(3757\\) is divisible by 13, yielding \\(289\\).\n\n**Reflection:** Successfully found another prime factor.\n\n**Prime Factors So Far:** \n\\[2, 5, 13\\]\n\n---\n\n## **Step 10: Factoring \\(289\\)**\n\nRecognizing \\(289\\) as a perfect square:\n\n\\[\n17 \\times 17 = 289\n\\]\n\nThus, **17** is a prime factor.\n\n**Prime Factors So Far:** \n\\[2, 5, 13, 17\\]\n\n---\n\n## **Step 11: Reviewing the Prime Factors**\n\nLet's verify our prime factors:\n\n- **2:** Repeated divisions until \\(18785\\)\n- **5:** Divided \\(18785\\) to get \\(3757\\)\n- **13:** Divided \\(3757\\) to get \\(289\\)\n- **17:** Prime factor of \\(289\\)\n\n**Reflection:** Does this list make sense? To ensure accuracy, let's verify by multiplying the factors back together.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 12: Verifying by Multiplication**\n\n\\[\n2^3 \\times 5 \\times 13 \\times 17 = 8 \\times 5 \\times 13 \\times 17\n\\]\n\n\\[\n8 \\times 5 = 40\n\\]\n\\[\n40 \\times 13 = 520\n\\]\n\\[\n520 \\times 17 = 8840\n\\]\n\n**Outcome:** Wait, this doesn't match \\(150280\\). Did I miss something?\n\n---\n\n## **Step 13: Identifying the Oversight**\n\nI realize that \\(289 = 17 \\times 17\\), meaning **17** appears twice in the factorization. This was initially overlooked.\n\n**Reflection:** Accounting for all factors, including repeated ones, is crucial.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 14: Correcting the Factorization**\n\nUpdating the prime factors to include the repeated **17**:\n\n\\[\n2^3 \\times 5 \\times 13 \\times 17^2\n\\]\n\n**Verification Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n8 \\times 5 = 40\n\\]\n\\[\n40 \\times 13 = 520\n\\]\n\\[\n520 \\times 17 = 8840\n\\]\n\\[\n8840 \\times 17 = 150280\n\\]\n\n**Outcome:** Now the multiplication matches \\(150280\\), confirming the factorization is correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 15: Summing the Different Prime Factors**\n\nNow, let's sum the unique prime factors: **2, 5, 13, and 17**.\n\n\\[\n2 + 5 + 13 + 17 = 37\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This sum aligns with the identified prime factors, ensuring correctness.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAfter methodically factoring \\(150280\\) and verifying each step, the sum of its different prime factors is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{37}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nThis problem required a systematic approach to prime factorization, starting with the smallest primes and proceeding step-by-step. Along the way, verification through multiplication was essential to catch and correct any oversights, ensuring the final answer's accuracy. Always double-checking work helps maintain reliability, especially with complex calculations like prime factorization.",
