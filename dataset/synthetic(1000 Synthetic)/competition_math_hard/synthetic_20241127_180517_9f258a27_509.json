  "solution": "## **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nAlright, we have a license plate format: four letters, a dash, and two digits. The trick is that exactly one letter is repeated exactly once, but digits can't be repeated. This reminds me of permutation problems where certain elements are repeated, but I'm not entirely sure how to account for the repetition right off the bat.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**  \n- Do I treat the repeated letter differently in the permutations?\n- How does the non-repetition of digits affect the total combinations?\n- Should I calculate letters and digits separately, then combine them?\n\n**Possible Strategies:**  \n1. Calculate the total combinations without restrictions and then adjust for the repetition.\n2. Use combinatorics to directly account for the repeated letter.\n3. Consider each position individually and see how repetition affects choices.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, calculating total combinations first and then adjusting might be easier to handle, but it could lead to overcounting. Maybe starting by explicitly accounting for the repeated letter is better.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 1: Calculate Total Combinations Without Restrictions**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s see how many combinations there are if there were no restrictions on repeating letters or digits. This might give a baseline to work from.\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- **Letters:** 26 choices for each of the four positions.\n  \\[\n  26^4 = 456,976\n  \\]\n  \n- **Digits:** 10 choices for each of the two positions.\n  \\[\n  10^2 = 100\n  \\]\n\n- **Total Combinations:**  \n  \\[\n  456,976 \\times 100 = 45,697,600\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, this doesn\u2019t account for the requirement that exactly one letter is repeated and digits can\u2019t be repeated. This number is definitely too high. I need to refine this approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n<ANSWER>45,697,600</ANSWER> solution\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoesn't align with the problem's constraints. Total is too high.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 2: Adjusting for Letter Repetition and Digit Non-Repetition**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nOkay, since Strategy 1 overcounts, let's adjust it by incorporating the conditions from the start. I\u2019ll focus on how to handle exactly one letter being repeated and ensure digits are unique.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- How many ways can I select which letter repeats?\n- How does the repetition affect the remaining letter slots?\n- How do I ensure digits are non-repeating?\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis reminds me of permutation problems with repeated elements. Maybe using combinatorics to account for the repetition is the way to go.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Implementing Strategy 2**\n\n---\n\n### **Part A: Handling the Letters with One Repetition**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI need to choose one letter to repeat and then fill the remaining slots with different letters. Let's break it down:\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Choose the Letter to Repeat:**  \n   - 26 possible letters.\n\n   \\[\n   26 \\text{ choices}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choose Positions for the Repeated Letter:**  \n   - Out of four slots, choose two for the repeated letter.\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\text{ ways}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Fill Remaining Slots with Different Letters:**  \n   - The remaining two slots need different letters from the repeated one.\n   - 25 choices for the first remaining slot (since one letter is repeated).\n   - 24 choices for the second remaining slot (to avoid repeating any letter).\n\n   \\[\n   25 \\times 24 = 600\n   \\]\n\n**Total Combinations for Letters:**  \n\\[\n26 \\times 6 \\times 600 = 93,600\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems reasonable. By selecting the repeated letter and its positions, then filling in the rest with unique letters, I'm aligning with the problem's requirements.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this account for all possible letter arrangements with one repetition? Yes, by choosing positions and ensuring the remaining letters are unique.\n\n---\n\n### **Part B: Handling the Two Digits Without Repetition**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to select two different digits. Since digits can't repeat, it's a straightforward permutation problem.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Choose the First Digit:**  \n   - 10 possible digits (0-9).\n\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ choices}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choose the Second Digit:**  \n   - 9 remaining choices (since digits can't repeat).\n\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ choices}\n   \\]\n\n**Total Combinations for Digits:**  \n\\[\n10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense. By ensuring the second digit is different from the first, I adhere to the non-repetition requirement.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n10 choices for the first digit and 9 for the second seem correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Combining Letter and Digit Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFinally, I need to combine the letter and digit combinations to get the total number of license plates.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n93,600 \\times 90 = 8,424,000\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems much more realistic than the initial overcounted number. By accounting for letter repetition and digit uniqueness separately, I\u2019ve narrowed down the total combinations accurately.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nDoes this total align with the problem's constraints? Yes, it accounts for exactly one letter being repeated and digits being unique.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Final Answer**\n\n---\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8,424,000}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBy carefully considering the constraints\u2014exactly one letter repeated and non-repeating digits\u2014we arrived at a total of 8,424,000 valid license plates.\n\n---\n\n**Wrap-Up:**  \nStarting with an unrestricted total helped identify the need for adjustments. By recognizing overcounting, shifting strategies to account for specific constraints, and validating each step, we ensured that the final answer accurately reflects the problem's requirements.",
