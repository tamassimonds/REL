  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's put this all together into a coherent and complete solution, just like a human would\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking along the way, and adjusting our approach as needed. I'll capture my thought process step by step, including any initial ideas, realizations, and corrections.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, we have two parabolas:\n\n\\[\ny = 2x^2 - 10x - 10\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = x^2 - 4x + 6\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to find all points where these parabolas intersect and list them in order of increasing \\( x \\)-coordinates.\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n- **Intersection Points:** I know that intersection points occur where both equations have the same \\( y \\)-value for the same \\( x \\)-value. So, setting the equations equal to each other seems like a good starting point.\n  \n- **Solving Algebraically:** Maybe I can solve the resulting equation for \\( x \\) and then find the corresponding \\( y \\)-values.\n  \n- **Graphical Insight:** Visualizing might help\u2014perhaps sketching the parabolas to estimate where they intersect.\n\n**Wait, What?**\n\nHmm, I'm not entirely sure how many intersection points there are\u2014could be one, two, or none. I think I need to explore further to confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Setting the Equations Equal**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s set the two equations equal to find the \\( x \\)-values where they intersect:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 10x - 10 = x^2 - 4x + 6\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Subtract \\( x^2 \\) from both sides:\n\n  \\[\n  2x^2 - x^2 - 10x - 10 = -4x + 6 \\\\\n  x^2 - 10x - 10 = -4x + 6\n  \\]\n\n- **Step 2:** Add \\( 4x \\) to both sides:\n\n  \\[\n  x^2 - 10x + 4x - 10 = 6 \\\\\n  x^2 - 6x - 10 = 6\n  \\]\n\n- **Step 3:** Subtract 6 from both sides:\n\n  \\[\n  x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, that simplifies nicely to a quadratic equation. This seems correct so far. I'm feeling confident to proceed.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to solve \\( x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0 \\) for \\( x \\). I can either factor it, use the quadratic formula, or complete the square. Let me think...\n\n- **Factoring:** Does it factor neatly? Not sure off the top of my head.\n  \n- **Quadratic Formula:** Always works, so might be safer.\n\nI'll try factoring first to see if it\u2019s straightforward.\n\n**Attempting to Factor:**\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-16\\) and add to \\(-6\\). Let\u2019s see...\n\n\\[\n(x - 8)(x + 2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- \\(-8 + 2 = -6\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  \n- \\(-8 \\times 2 = -16\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nGreat! Factoring worked. So, the solutions are:\n\n\\[\nx - 8 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 8\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx + 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -2\n\\]\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Finding Corresponding \\( y \\)-Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the \\( x \\)-coordinates, I need to find the corresponding \\( y \\)-values for each. I can plug these \\( x \\)-values back into either of the original equations. To be safe, I\u2019ll use both equations and see if the \\( y \\)-values match\u2014this will also serve as a check.\n\n**Calculations for \\( x = -2 \\):**\n\n- **Using \\( y = 2x^2 - 10x - 10 \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  y = 2(-2)^2 - 10(-2) - 10 \\\\\n  = 2(4) + 20 - 10 \\\\\n  = 8 + 20 - 10 \\\\\n  = 18\n  \\]\n\n- **Using \\( y = x^2 - 4x + 6 \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  y = (-2)^2 - 4(-2) + 6 \\\\\n  = 4 + 8 + 6 \\\\\n  = 18\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nBoth equations give \\( y = 18 \\) when \\( x = -2 \\). That\u2019s consistent!\n\n**Calculations for \\( x = 8 \\):**\n\n- **Using \\( y = 2x^2 - 10x - 10 \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  y = 2(8)^2 - 10(8) - 10 \\\\\n  = 2(64) - 80 - 10 \\\\\n  = 128 - 80 - 10 \\\\\n  = 38\n  \\]\n\n- **Using \\( y = x^2 - 4x + 6 \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  y = (8)^2 - 4(8) + 6 \\\\\n  = 64 - 32 + 6 \\\\\n  = 38\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nAgain, both equations give \\( y = 38 \\) when \\( x = 8 \\). This confirms the intersection points are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflecting on the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe \\( x \\)-coordinates we found are \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\), with corresponding \\( y \\)-values of 18 and 38, respectively. Listing the points in order of increasing \\( x \\)-coordinate:\n\n\\[\n(-2, 18); \\quad (8, 38)\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out\u2014the \\( y \\)-values match for both equations at the given \\( x \\)-coordinates. So, the intersection points are correctly identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(\n(-2, 18); \\quad (8, 38)\n\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy setting the two parabolic equations equal, simplifying to a quadratic equation, factoring to find the \\( x \\)-coordinates, and then verifying the corresponding \\( y \\)-values using both original equations, we successfully identified the intersection points. Regular checks along the way ensured the correctness of each step, leading us to the accurate solution.\n\n---\n\nThere we go! We've worked through the problem step by step, reflecting and checking at each stage to ensure everything is correct.",
  "ground_truth": "First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-10x-10=x^2-4x+6$. Combine like terms to get $x^2-6x=16$. To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{6}{2}\\right)^2=9$ to both sides, giving $(x-3)^2=16+9=25$.\n\nSo we have $x-3=\\pm5$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $8$. Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-2,18)}$ and $\\boxed{(8,38)}$."
