  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into this problem. My original approach had some good insights, but I see now where I went astray. Let me walk through my thought process again, keeping the useful parts and correcting the errors to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst Thoughts:  \nWe need to find the smallest positive integer \\( N \\) such that among \\( N \\), \\( N+1 \\), and \\( N+2 \\), each is divisible by one of \\( 2^2 \\), \\( 3^2 \\), \\( 5^2 \\), and \\( 7^2 \\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a problem involving divisibility over consecutive numbers. Maybe I can assign each divisor to \\( N \\), \\( N+1 \\), or \\( N+2 \\) and see what fits.\n\n- **Reflection:** But wait, there are four divisors and only three numbers. Hmm... that means one of the divisors might overlap or be unnecessary. I need to think about how to handle that.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Assigning Divisors to \\( N, N+1, N+2 \\):**  \n   - Try mapping each divisor to one of the three numbers.\n\n2. **Using Patterns in Consecutive Numbers:**  \n   - Look for patterns in how squares of primes divide consecutive numbers.\n\n3. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Approach:**  \n   - Calculate the LCM of the required divisors to find the smallest \\( N \\).\n\n4. **Trial and Error with Small \\( N \\):**  \n   - Start with small numbers and see which \\( N \\) satisfies all conditions.\n\n- **Initial Choice:** Let\u2019s start with assigning divisors and see if that works.\n\n- **Reflection:** If assigning doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll consider looking for patterns or using LCM. Trial and error might be too slow, but it could help in verifying the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Assigning Divisors**\n\nLet\u2019s try assigning each divisor to \\( N, N+1, N+2 \\):\n\n- **Suppose:**\n  - \\( N \\) is divisible by \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)\n  - \\( N+1 \\) is divisible by \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n  - \\( N+2 \\) is divisible by \\( 5^2 = 25 \\)\n  - But what about \\( 7^2 = 49 \\)? There's no fourth number to assign it to!\n\n- **First Thought:** This doesn\u2019t fit neatly since we only have three numbers but four divisors.\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** Maybe one of the numbers needs to be divisible by multiple squares, or perhaps one divisor is implicitly covered by another.\n\n- **Conclusion:** This strategy alone isn\u2019t sufficient. I need to consider overlapping divisibility or find a different approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Patterns in Consecutive Numbers**\n\nLet\u2019s think about how squares of primes divide consecutive numbers. Primes are coprime to each other, so their squares don\u2019t generally overlap in small numbers.\n\n- **Idea:** Maybe I can find the smallest \\( N \\) where these divisibility conditions are met by observing patterns in multiples of \\( 4, 9, 25, \\) and \\( 49 \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** This still feels abstract. Perhaps I need a more concrete method or another strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Least Common Multiple (LCM) Approach**\n\nOkay, let\u2019s consider using LCM. If \\( N \\) needs to be divisible by multiple squares, perhaps finding the LCM of those squares could help.\n\n- **Thought Process:** Maybe the smallest \\( N \\) is a multiple of the LCM of these squares. But since we only need three numbers to cover four divisors, it complicates things.\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** This approach might lead to overconstraints because the LCM would force \\( N \\) to be divisible by all squares simultaneously, which isn\u2019t necessary.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The LCM approach isn\u2019t directly applicable here. I need a different strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 4: Trial and Error with Small \\( N \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s try starting with small \\( N \\) and see if the conditions are satisfied.\n\n- **First Guess:** Let\u2019s start with \\( N = 0 \\).\n  - \\( N = 0 \\): Divisible by any number.\n  - \\( N+1 = 1 \\): Not divisible by \\( 4, 9, 25, 49 \\).\n  - \\( N+2 = 2 \\): Not divisible by \\( 4, 9, 25, 49 \\).\n  - **Conclusion:** \\( N = 0 \\) doesn\u2019t work.\n\n- **Next Guess:** Let\u2019s try \\( N = 1 \\).\n  - \\( N = 1 \\): Not divisible by \\( 4, 9, 25, 49 \\).\n  - \\( N+1 = 2 \\): Not divisible by \\( 4, 9, 25, 49 \\).\n  - \\( N+2 = 3 \\): Not divisible by \\( 4, 9, 25, 49 \\).\n  - **Conclusion:** \\( N = 1 \\) doesn\u2019t satisfy the conditions.\n\n- **Reflection:** This trial and error method is too slow. I need a more systematic approach to find the correct \\( N \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Reassessing the Approach**\n\nWait a minute, the trial and error method isn\u2019t efficient. Perhaps I need to think about the remainders when \\( N \\) is divided by \\( 4, 9, 25, \\) and \\( 49 \\).\n\n- **New Idea:** Set up congruences for \\( N \\) such that:\n  - One of \\( N, N+1, N+2 \\) is divisible by \\( 4 \\)\n  - One is divisible by \\( 9 \\)\n  - One is divisible by \\( 25 \\)\n  - One is divisible by \\( 49 \\)\n\n- **Thought Process:** This sounds more promising. I can assign each divisor to one of the three numbers and solve for \\( N \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Setting Up Congruences**\n\nLet\u2019s assign each divisor to \\( N, N+1, \\) or \\( N+2 \\) and see if we can find a suitable \\( N \\).\n\n- **Suppose:**\n  - \\( N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} \\)\n  - \\( N+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\)\n  - \\( N+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25} \\)\n  - But wait, there\u2019s also \\( 7^2 = 49 \\) that needs to fit in!\n\n- **First Thought:** This assignment doesn\u2019t cover all four divisors since we only assigned three conditions.\n\n- **Reflection:** I need to assign \\( 49 \\) as well. Perhaps I need to assign multiples of these squares to ensure all conditions are met.\n\n- **Conclusion:** I need to reassign the divisors to ensure all four are covered.\n\n---\n\n### **Reassigning Divisors**\n\nLet\u2019s try a different assignment:\n\n- **Suppose:**\n  - \\( N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} \\)\n  - \\( N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\)\n  - \\( N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25} \\)\n  - \\( N+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49} \\)\n\n- **Thought Process:** This implies that \\( N \\) is divisible by the LCM of \\( 4, 9, \\) and \\( 25 \\), and \\( N+1 \\) is divisible by \\( 49 \\).\n\n- **Calculating LCM:**  \n  - LCM of \\( 4 \\) and \\( 9 \\) is \\( 36 \\).  \n  - LCM of \\( 36 \\) and \\( 25 \\) is \\( 900 \\).  \n\n- **Conclusion:** So, \\( N \\) must be a multiple of \\( 900 \\), and \\( N+1 \\) must be divisible by \\( 49 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the Congruences**\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\( N \\) such that:\n\n1. \\( N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{900} \\)\n2. \\( N+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49} \\) \u21d2 \\( N \\equiv -1 \\pmod{49} \\)\n\n- **Thought Process:** This sets up a system of two congruences. I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve it.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem**\n\nLet\u2019s solve the system step by step.\n\n#### **Step 1: Expressing \\( N \\)**\n\n- Let\u2019s express \\( N \\) as:  \n  \\[ N = 900k \\quad \\text{for some integer } k \\]\n\n- Substitute into the second congruence:  \n  \\[ 900k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{49} \\]\n\n- **Simplifying:**  \n  \\[ 900 \\mod 49 = 18 \\]  \n  So, the congruence becomes:  \n  \\[ 18k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{49} \\]\n\n#### **Step 2: Finding the Inverse of \\( 18 \\mod 49 \\)**\n\n- We need to find \\( x \\) such that:  \n  \\[ 18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{49} \\]\n\n- **Using Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**  \n  \\[ \n  49 = 2 \\times 18 + 13 \\\\\n  18 = 1 \\times 13 + 5 \\\\\n  13 = 2 \\times 5 + 3 \\\\\n  5 = 1 \\times 3 + 2 \\\\\n  3 = 1 \\times 2 + 1 \\\\\n  2 = 2 \\times 1 + 0 \\\\\n  \\]\n\n- **Backtracking:**  \n  \\[ \n  1 = 3 - 1 \\times 2 \\\\\n  = 3 - 1 \\times (5 - 1 \\times 3) \\\\\n  = 2 \\times 3 - 1 \\times 5 \\\\\n  = 2 \\times (13 - 2 \\times 5) - 1 \\times 5 \\\\\n  = 2 \\times 13 - 4 \\times 5 - 1 \\times 5 \\\\\n  = 2 \\times 13 - 5 \\times 5 \\\\\n  = 2 \\times (49 - 2 \\times 18) - 5 \\times 5 \\\\\n  = 2 \\times 49 - 4 \\times 18 - 5 \\times (49 - 2 \\times 18) \\\\\n  = 7 \\times 49 - 14 \\times 18 \\\\\n  \\]\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  \\[ 18 \\times (-14) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{49} \\]  \n  So, the inverse of \\( 18 \\mod 49 \\) is \\( -14 \\equiv 35 \\pmod{49} \\).\n\n#### **Step 3: Solving for \\( k \\)**\n\n- Multiply both sides of \\( 18k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{49} \\) by \\( 35 \\):  \n  \\[ k \\equiv -35 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{49} \\]  \n  (since \\( -35 + 49 = 14 \\))\n\n- **Expressing \\( k \\):**  \n  \\[ k = 49m + 14 \\quad \\text{for some integer } m \\]\n\n#### **Step 4: Substituting Back into \\( N \\)**\n\n- Substitute back into \\( N = 900k \\):  \n  \\[ \n  N = 900(49m + 14) = 44100m + 12600 \n  \\]\n\n- **Simplifying:**  \n  \\[ \n  N \\equiv 12600 \\pmod{44100} \n  \\]\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The smallest positive \\( N \\) is \\( 12600 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Wait a Minute, Let\u2019s Re-evaluate**\n\n- **Checking the Assignments:**  \n  Let\u2019s verify if \\( N = 12600 \\) satisfies all conditions.\n\n  - **\\( N = 12600 \\):**  \n    - Divisible by \\( 4 \\), \\( 9 \\), and \\( 25 \\) \u21d2 LCM = \\( 900 \\)  \n    - \\( 12600 \\div 900 = 14 \\), remainder \\( 0 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n  - **\\( N+1 = 12601 \\):**  \n    - Need to be divisible by \\( 49 \\)  \n    - \\( 12601 \\div 49 = 257 \\), remainder \\( 28 \\) \u274c\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Uh-oh, \\( N+1 = 12601 \\) isn\u2019t divisible by \\( 49 \\). It seems there\u2019s an error in the assignment of divisors.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The initial assignment of divisors was incorrect. I need to reassign the divisors to ensure all conditions are met.\n\n---\n\n### **Reassigning Divisors Again**\n\nLet\u2019s try assigning \\( N+1 \\) to be divisible by both \\( 25 \\) and \\( 49 \\), and see if that helps.\n\n- **New Assignments:**\n  - \\( N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} \\)\n  - \\( N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\)\n  - \\( N+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25} \\)\n  - \\( N+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49} \\)\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  This implies that \\( N+1 \\) is divisible by the LCM of \\( 25 \\) and \\( 49 \\), which is \\( 1225 \\).\n\n- **Calculating LCM:**  \n  \\[ \\text{LCM}(25, 49) = 1225 \\]  \n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  So, \\( N \\) must be \\( 1 \\) less than a multiple of \\( 1225 \\), and also divisible by the LCM of \\( 4 \\) and \\( 9 \\), which is \\( 36 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Setting Up the New Congruences**\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\( N \\) such that:\n\n1. \\( N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{36} \\)\n2. \\( N+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{1225} \\) \u21d2 \\( N \\equiv -1 \\pmod{1225} \\)\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  This sets up a system of two congruences. I can use CRT to solve it.\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the New Congruences**\n\n#### **Step 1: Expressing \\( N \\)**\n\n- Let\u2019s express \\( N \\) as:  \n  \\[ N = 36k \\quad \\text{for some integer } k \\]\n\n- Substitute into the second congruence:  \n  \\[ 36k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{1225} \\]\n\n- **Simplifying:**  \n  \\[ 36 \\mod 1225 = 36 \\]  \n  (since \\( 36 < 1225 \\))\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The congruence becomes:  \n  \\[ 36k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{1225} \\]\n\n#### **Step 2: Finding the Inverse of \\( 36 \\mod 1225 \\)**\n\n- We need to find \\( x \\) such that:  \n  \\[ 36x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1225} \\]\n\n- **Using Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**  \n  \\[ \n  1225 = 34 \\times 36 + 1 \\\\\n  36 = 36 \\times 1 + 0 \\\\\n  \\]\n\n- **Backtracking:**  \n  \\[ \n  1 = 1225 - 34 \\times 36 \\\\\n  \\]\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  \\[ 36 \\times (-34) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1225} \\]  \n  So, the inverse of \\( 36 \\mod 1225 \\) is \\( -34 \\equiv 1191 \\pmod{1225} \\).\n\n#### **Step 3: Solving for \\( k \\)**\n\n- Multiply both sides of \\( 36k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{1225} \\) by \\( 1191 \\):  \n  \\[ k \\equiv -1191 \\equiv 34 \\pmod{1225} \\]  \n  (since \\( -1191 + 1225 = 34 \\))\n\n- **Expressing \\( k \\):**  \n  \\[ k = 1225m + 34 \\quad \\text{for some integer } m \\]\n\n#### **Step 4: Substituting Back into \\( N \\)**\n\n- Substitute back into \\( N = 36k \\):  \n  \\[ N = 36(1225m + 34) = 44100m + 1224 \\]\n\n- **Simplifying:**  \n  \\[ N \\equiv 1224 \\pmod{44100} \\]\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The smallest positive \\( N \\) is \\( 1224 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Solution**\n\nLet\u2019s verify if \\( N = 1224 \\) satisfies all conditions.\n\n- **\\( N = 1224 \\):**\n  - Divisible by \\( 4 \\) and \\( 9 \\) \u21d2 LCM = \\( 36 \\)\n  - \\( 1224 \\div 36 = 34 \\), remainder \\( 0 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **\\( N+1 = 1225 \\):**\n  - Divisible by \\( 25 \\) and \\( 49 \\) \u21d2 LCM = \\( 1225 \\)\n  - \\( 1225 \\div 1225 = 1 \\), remainder \\( 0 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **\\( N+2 = 1226 \\):**\n  - No specific divisibility required, as all four squares are already assigned to \\( N \\) and \\( N+1 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  All conditions are satisfied with \\( N = 1224 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **But Wait, There\u2019s a Better Way**\n\nActually, looking at this again, I realize that there might be a more efficient approach. Instead of setting up complex congruences, I can start by considering multiples of the largest square, \\( 7^2 = 49 \\), and see if the conditions are met.\n\n- **New Strategy:**  \n  Start with multiples of \\( 49 \\) and check if the other conditions are satisfied for \\( N, N+1, N+2 \\).\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  This might lead me to the correct answer more quickly by narrowing down the possibilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementing the New Strategy**\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the multiples of \\( 49 \\) and see which \\( N \\) satisfies all conditions.\n\n#### **Step 1: Testing \\( N = 49 \\)**\n\n- **\\( N = 49 \\):**\n  - Divisible by \\( 7^2 = 49 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **\\( N+1 = 50 \\):**\n  - Divisible by \\( 5^2 = 25 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **\\( N+2 = 51 \\):**\n  - Not divisible by \\( 2^2 = 4 \\) or \\( 3^2 = 9 \\) \u274c\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  \\( N = 49 \\) almost works, but \\( N+2 = 51 \\) isn\u2019t divisible by \\( 4 \\) or \\( 9 \\). So, \\( N = 49 \\) doesn\u2019t satisfy all conditions.\n\n#### **Step 2: Testing \\( N = 98 \\)**\n\n- **\\( N = 98 \\):**\n  - Divisible by \\( 7^2 = 49 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **\\( N+1 = 99 \\):**\n  - Divisible by \\( 3^2 = 9 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **\\( N+2 = 100 \\):**\n  - Divisible by \\( 2^2 = 4 \\) and \\( 5^2 = 25 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  All conditions are satisfied with \\( N = 98 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nLet\u2019s verify that \\( N = 98 \\) meets all the requirements.\n\n- **\\( N = 98 \\):**\n  - Divisible by \\( 7^2 = 49 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **\\( N+1 = 99 \\):**\n  - Divisible by \\( 3^2 = 9 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **\\( N+2 = 100 \\):**\n  - Divisible by \\( 2^2 = 4 \\) and \\( 5^2 = 25 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **Additional Note:**  \n  Although \\( N+2 = 100 \\) is divisible by both \\( 4 \\) and \\( 25 \\), the problem only requires each of the three numbers to be divisible by one of the specified squares. Therefore, all conditions are satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Answer**\n\nAfter reassessing my approach and testing multiples of \\( 49 \\), I found that the smallest positive integer \\( N \\) satisfying all conditions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{98}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Reflection:** My initial strategies were leading me in the right direction, but I was overcomplicating the problem by trying to assign all four divisors to three numbers. By shifting focus to multiples of the largest square and checking the divisibility conditions, I was able to find the correct \\( N \\) more efficiently.\n\n- **Lesson Learned:** Sometimes, starting with the largest constraints and simplifying the problem can lead to a quicker solution. Trial and error with a targeted approach can be more effective than setting up complex congruences.\n\n- **Final Check:** Always verify the solution by checking all conditions to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Original First Thoughts and Attempts**\n\n1. **Initial Brainstorming:** \n   - **First Thought:** I considered assigning each divisor (\\(2^2\\), \\(3^2\\), \\(5^2\\), \\(7^2\\)) to \\(N\\), \\(N+1\\), and \\(N+2\\).\n   - **Reflection:** Realized that there are four divisors but only three numbers, which means one divisor must overlap or be unnecessary.\n   - **Conclusion:** This strategy might not work as is, leading me to reconsider how the divisors are assigned.\n\n2. **Exploring Patterns in Consecutive Numbers:** \n   - **Idea:** Look for patterns in how squares of primes divide consecutive numbers.\n   - **Reflection:** Still feels abstract; maybe not the best approach.\n   - **Conclusion:** Need a more concrete method.\n\n3. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Approach:** \n   - **Thought Process:** Consider using LCM to find the smallest \\(N\\).\n   - **Wait a Minute:** Realized that using LCM might overcomplicate things since we only need three numbers to cover four divisors.\n   - **Conclusion:** The LCM approach isn\u2019t directly applicable here.\n\n4. **Trial and Error with Small \\(N\\):** \n   - **First Guess:** Tried \\(N = 0\\) and \\(N = 1\\), but neither satisfied the conditions.\n   - **Reflection:** This trial and error method is too slow.\n   - **Conclusion:** Need a more systematic approach.\n\n### **Identifying the Original Error**\n\n- **Original Approach:** \n  - I set up congruences assigning multiple divisors to \\(N\\) and \\(N+1\\), which led to overcomplicating the problem and resulting in an incorrect \\(N\\).\n\n- **Specific Error:** \n  - Assigning \\(N\\) to be divisible by \\(4\\), \\(9\\), and \\(25\\), and \\(N+1\\) by \\(49\\), leading to \\(N = 1224\\), which is incorrect.\n\n- **Reflection:** \n  - Realized that the initial assignment of divisors was flawed because it overconstrained \\(N\\) and didn't properly account for all four divisors within three numbers.\n\n### **Correcting the Approach**\n\n1. **Reassessing the Strategy:** \n   - **Wait a Minute:** Recognized the need to reassign divisors correctly to ensure all conditions are met.\n   - **New Idea:** Consider assigning \\(N\\), \\(N+1\\), and \\(N+2\\) in a way that each is divisible by one of the required squares without overconstraining.\n\n2. **Implementing the New Strategy:** \n   - **Thought Process:** Start by considering multiples of the largest square, \\(7^2 = 49\\), and check if the other conditions are satisfied for \\(N\\), \\(N+1\\), and \\(N+2\\).\n\n3. **Testing Multiples of \\(49\\):** \n   - **Testing \\(N = 49\\):** \n     - \\(N = 49\\): Divisible by \\(49\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n     - \\(N+1 = 50\\): Divisible by \\(25\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n     - \\(N+2 = 51\\): Not divisible by \\(4\\) or \\(9\\) \u274c\n     - **Conclusion:** \\(N = 49\\) doesn\u2019t satisfy all conditions.\n\n   - **Testing \\(N = 98\\):** \n     - \\(N = 98\\): Divisible by \\(49\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n     - \\(N+1 = 99\\): Divisible by \\(9\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n     - \\(N+2 = 100\\): Divisible by \\(4\\) and \\(25\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n     - **Conclusion:** All conditions are satisfied with \\(N = 98\\).\n\n4. **Final Check:** \n   - **Verification:** \n     - \\(N = 98\\): Divisible by \\(49\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n     - \\(N+1 = 99\\): Divisible by \\(9\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n     - \\(N+2 = 100\\): Divisible by \\(4\\) and \\(25\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n   - **Additional Note:** Although \\(N+2 = 100\\) is divisible by both \\(4\\) and \\(25\\), the problem only requires each of the three numbers to be divisible by one of the specified squares.

  "ground_truth": "The most efficient means of searching for this trio of integers is to begin with the multiples of $7^2$.  The first such number is 49, which almost works, since 50 is divisible by $5^2$ and 48 is divisible by $2^2$.  But none of the nearby numbers is divisible by $3^2$, so we move on to the next multiple of $7^2$, which is 98.  To our delight we discover that $3^2$ divides 99, while $2^2$ and $5^2$ divide 100.  Hence we should take $N=\\boxed{98}$."
