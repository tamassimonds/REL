  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming**\n\nOkay, looking at the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2-n}{n+1} + \\frac{2n-4}{2-n} = 1\n\\]\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like an equation involving fractions with variables in the numerator and denominator. It reminds me of rational equations I've dealt with before.\n  \n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  - **Strategy 1:** Combine the fractions on the left-hand side (LHS) to simplify.\n  - **Strategy 2:** Try to identify any obvious simplifications or factorings in the numerators or denominators.\n  - **Strategy 3:** Consider multiplying through by a common denominator to eliminate the fractions.\n  \n- **Wait a Minute:** The denominators involve \\( n \\), so I need to be careful about possible restrictions on \\( n \\) (like values that make the denominator zero).\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Combining Fractions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's try combining the fractions on the LHS to see if that simplifies things.\n\n**Combining Fractions:**\n\nThe denominators are \\( n+1 \\) and \\( 2-n \\). To combine them, I need a common denominator.\n\n- **Common Denominator:** \\( (n+1)(2-n) \\)\n\n**Wait, Reflection:**\n\nBut wait, \\( 2-n \\) can be rewritten as \\( -(n-2) \\). Maybe that'll help later.\n\n**Proceeding Anyway:**\n\nFor now, let's stick with the common denominator.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(2-n)(2-n)}{(n+1)(2-n)} + \\frac{(2n-4)(n+1)}{(n+1)(2-n)} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Numerators:**\n\n- **First Fraction:**\n  \\[\n  (2-n)(2-n) = (2-n)^2 = 4 - 4n + n^2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Second Fraction:**\n  \\[\n  (2n-4)(n+1) = 2n^2 + 2n - 4n - 4 = 2n^2 - 2n - 4\n  \\]\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\n\nThis is getting messy. Let me reflect\u2014does this simplification make sense? Combining these might lead to a complicated quadratic. Perhaps there's a better way.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\nMaybe multiplying both sides by the common denominator to eliminate the fractions would be cleaner.\n\n---\n\n### **Switching to Strategy 3: Multiplying Through by Common Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's multiply both sides by \\( (n+1)(2-n) \\) to get rid of the denominators.\n\n**But Before That:**\n\n- **Note:** Need to ensure that \\( (n+1)(2-n) \\neq 0 \\). So, \\( n \\neq -1 \\) and \\( n \\neq 2 \\). These are restrictions we'll need to consider later.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\nMultiply both sides:\n\n\\[\n(2-n)(2-n) + (2n-4)(n+1) = (n+1)(2-n)\n\\]\n\n**Expanding Both Sides:**\n\n- **LHS:**\n  \\[\n  (2-n)^2 + (2n-4)(n+1) = 4 - 4n + n^2 + 2n^2 - 2n - 4 = 3n^2 - 6n\n  \\]\n  \n- **RHS:**\n  \\[\n  n^2 - 2n + n - 2 = n^2 - n - 2\n  \\]\n\n**Writing the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n3n^2 - 6n = n^2 - n - 2\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Second:**\n\nThis looks like a quadratic equation. Let's bring everything to one side to simplify.\n\n---\n\n### **Simplifying the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMove all terms to one side to set the equation to zero.\n\n\\[\n3n^2 - 6n - n^2 + n + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n2n^2 - 5n + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. I can try factoring it or using the quadratic formula. Let me see if it factors nicely first.\n\n---\n\n### **Attempting to Factor the Quadratic**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLook for two numbers that multiply to \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\) and add to \\( -5 \\).\n\n- **Possible Factors:** \\( -4 \\) and \\( -1 \\)\n\n**Factoring:**\n\n\\[\n2n^2 - 4n - n + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2n(n - 2) - 1(n - 2) = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n(2n - 1)(n - 2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Wait, Let Me Check:**\n\n- **Expanding Back:**\n  \\[\n  (2n - 1)(n - 2) = 2n^2 - 4n - n + 2 = 2n^2 - 5n + 2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Verification:** Yup, that works!\n\n---\n\n### **Solving for \\( n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSet each factor to zero.\n\n\\[\n2n - 1 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n - 2 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solving:**\n\n- **First Solution:**\n  \\[\n  2n - 1 = 0 \\implies n = \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Second Solution:**\n  \\[\n  n - 2 = 0 \\implies n = 2\n  \\]\n\n**Wait, Remember the Restrictions:**\n\nEarlier, we noted that \\( n \\neq 2 \\) because it would make the denominator zero.\n\n**Final Solutions:**\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\text{(valid solution)}\n\\]\n\\[\nn = 2 \\quad \\text{(invalid, because it makes the denominator zero)}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Valid Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAlways good to verify the solution by plugging it back into the original equation.\n\n**Plugging \\( n = \\frac{1}{2} \\) into the Original Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 - \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2} + 1} + \\frac{2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} - 4}{2 - \\frac{1}{2}} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{\\frac{3}{2}} + \\frac{1 - 4}{\\frac{3}{2}} = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{-3}{\\frac{3}{2}} = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n1 - 2 = 1 \\quad \\text{(Wait, that doesn't work!)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, something's off here. According to this, \\( n = \\frac{1}{2} \\) doesn't satisfy the equation. Let me double-check my steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe there was an error in simplifying or an assumption that's incorrect. Let's go back and see where things might have gone wrong.\n\n**Re-examining the Original Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2-n}{n+1} + \\frac{2n-4}{2-n} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Recognizing Reciprocal Terms**\n\n- **Observation:** The second term, \\( \\frac{2n-4}{2-n} \\), can be rewritten by factoring out negatives.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2n-4}{2-n} = \\frac{2(n-2)}{-(n-2)} = -2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{(Since } n \\neq 2\\text{)}\n\\]\n\n**Rewriting the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2-n}{n+1} - 2 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2-n}{n+1} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Wait, This Looks Simpler:**\n\nThis is much easier to solve. Let's proceed with this.\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the Simplified Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nCross-multiply to eliminate the fraction.\n\n\\[\n2 - n = 3(n + 1)\n\\]\n\n**Expanding:**\n\n\\[\n2 - n = 3n + 3\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging:**\n\n\\[\n2 - 3 = 3n + n\n\\]\n\\[\n-1 = 4n\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( n \\):**\n\n\\[\nn = -\\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Wait, Let's Check This Solution:**\n\nPlug \\( n = -\\frac{1}{4} \\) back into the original equation to verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the New Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAlways verify by substituting back into the original equation.\n\n**Plugging \\( n = -\\frac{1}{4} \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}{-\\frac{1}{4} + 1} + \\frac{2\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right) - 4}{2 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{9}{4}}{\\frac{3}{4}} + \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2} - 4}{\\frac{9}{4}} = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n3 + \\frac{-\\frac{9}{2}}{\\frac{9}{4}} = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n3 - 2 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n1 = 1 \\quad \\text{(Correct!)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis time, the solution checks out. It seems that the initial approach led me to an incorrect solution, but re-examining the equation and recognizing a simplification guided me to the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n**<ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{n = -\\frac{1}{4}}\n\\]\n\n**</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Lessons Learned:** Initially, I tried combining fractions and factoring, which led me to an incorrect solution. By revisiting the equation and recognizing that the second term simplifies neatly, I found a more straightforward path to the correct answer.\n\n- **Importance of Verification:** Checking the solution by substituting it back into the original equation was crucial in identifying and correcting the mistake.\n\n- **Flexibility in Problem Solving:** Being open to changing strategies and reflecting on each step helped me arrive at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\nThis approach mirrors a natural problem-solving process, complete with brainstorming, strategy changes, and verification, ultimately leading to the correct answer.\n\n**<ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{n = -\\frac{1}{4}}\n\\]\n\n**</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps you understand the problem-solving process better!",
