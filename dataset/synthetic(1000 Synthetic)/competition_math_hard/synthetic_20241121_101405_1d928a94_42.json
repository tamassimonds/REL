  "problem": "If $(ax+b)(bx+a)=26x^2+\\Box\\cdot x+26$, where $a$, $b$, and $\\Box$ are distinct integers, what is the minimum possible value of $\\Box$, the coefficient of $x$?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem like we would naturally\u2014thinking through different strategies, checking our work frequently, and being open to changing directions if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **1. First Impressions**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem, it involves expanding a quadratic expression and matching coefficients. My initial thought is that this resembles polynomial expansion and coefficient comparison. It reminds me of problems where we need to find unknown coefficients by equating both sides of an equation.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Expand the left side \\((ax + b)(bx + a)\\) and match coefficients with the right side \\(26x^2 + \\Box \\cdot x + 26\\).\n- **Strategy 2:** Assign specific values to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to simplify and see patterns.\n- **Strategy 3:** Use symmetry properties since the expressions seem interchangeable.\n\nRight now, Strategy 1 seems the most straightforward\u2014expanding and matching coefficients. But I'm open to switching if it gets messy.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Exploring Strategy 1: Expanding the Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's start by expanding \\((ax + b)(bx + a)\\). I'll distribute each term to see what the quadratic expression looks like.\n\n\\[\n(ax + b)(bx + a) = ax \\cdot bx + ax \\cdot a + b \\cdot bx + b \\cdot a\n\\]\n\n**Calculating:**\n\n\\[\n= abx^2 + a^2x + b^2x + ab\n\\]\n\n**Combining Like Terms:**\n\n\\[\n= abx^2 + (a^2 + b^2)x + ab\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, after expanding, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\nabx^2 + (a^2 + b^2)x + ab\n\\]\n\nThis matches the given quadratic:\n\n\\[\n26x^2 + \\Box \\cdot x + 26\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n\nWait a minute, the constant term on both sides is \\(ab\\) and 26. So, \\(ab = 26\\). That gives us a relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) right off the bat.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThis seems to be working\u2014by matching coefficients, we can set up equations to solve for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(\\Box\\).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Setting Up Equations by Matching Coefficients**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's match the coefficients from both sides of the equation:\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(x^2\\):**  \n   \\(ab = 26\\)\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\(x\\):**  \n   \\(a^2 + b^2 = \\Box\\)\n\n3. **Constant Term:**  \n   \\(ab = 26\\) (again)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWe've already established that \\(ab = 26\\). Now, we need to find \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that their squares add up to \\(\\Box\\), and all three (\\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(\\Box\\)) are distinct integers.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nGiven that \\(ab = 26\\), I can think of integer pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that their product is 26. Let's list them out:\n\n- \\((1, 26)\\)\n- \\((2, 13)\\)\n- \\((-1, -26)\\)\n- \\((-2, -13)\\)\n- And their reverses: \\((26, 1)\\), \\((13, 2)\\), etc.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are interchangeable, we can focus on one pairing direction. I\u2019ll start with \\((a, b) = (1, 26)\\) and see if it fits.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Testing Pair \\((a, b) = (1, 26)\\)**\n\n**Calculating \\(a^2 + b^2\\):**\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = 1^2 + 26^2 = 1 + 676 = 677\n\\]\n\n**Assigning \\(\\Box = 677\\):**\n\nSo, \\(\\Box = 677\\).\n\n**Checking Distinctness:**\n\n- \\(a = 1\\)\n- \\(b = 26\\)\n- \\(\\Box = 677\\)\n\nAll are distinct integers.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis works, but the problem asks for the minimum possible value of \\(\\Box\\). 677 is quite large, so maybe there's a smaller pair that still satisfies all conditions.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nPerhaps \\((1, 26)\\) isn't the optimal choice. Let's try a different pair with a smaller sum of squares.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Testing Pair \\((a, b) = (2, 13)\\)**\n\n**Calculating \\(a^2 + b^2\\):**\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = 2^2 + 13^2 = 4 + 169 = 173\n\\]\n\n**Assigning \\(\\Box = 173\\):**\n\nSo, \\(\\Box = 173\\).\n\n**Checking Distinctness:**\n\n- \\(a = 2\\)\n- \\(b = 13\\)\n- \\(\\Box = 173\\)\n\nAll are distinct integers.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n173 is significantly smaller than 677. This seems like a better choice. However, to ensure it's the minimum, I should consider negative pairs or other combinations.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nNegative pairs would still yield positive squares, and since \\(\\Box\\) is the sum of squares, using negatives doesn't change the outcome for \\(\\Box\\). But it's worth confirming.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Considering Negative Pair \\((a, b) = (-2, -13)\\)**\n\n**Calculating \\(a^2 + b^2\\):**\n\n\\[\n(-2)^2 + (-13)^2 = 4 + 169 = 173\n\\]\n\n**Assigning \\(\\Box = 173\\):**\n\nSo, \\(\\Box = 173\\).\n\n**Checking Distinctness:**\n\n- \\(a = -2\\)\n- \\(b = -13\\)\n- \\(\\Box = 173\\)\n\nAll are distinct integers.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe value of \\(\\Box\\) remains the same (173) regardless of the signs of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, \\((2, 13)\\) and \\((-2, -13)\\) both yield the same minimum \\(\\Box\\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nIt seems that \\(\\Box = 173\\) is the minimum possible value while keeping all three integers distinct. But let's do a quick sanity check to ensure everything aligns.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Sanity Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's verify that all conditions are met:\n\n- **Product \\(ab = 26\\):**  \n  \\(2 \\times 13 = 26\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **Sum of Squares \\(a^2 + b^2 = \\Box\\):**  \n  \\(4 + 169 = 173\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **Distinct Integers:**  \n  \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 13\\), \\(\\Box = 173\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAll conditions are satisfied with \\(\\Box = 173\\). No discrepancies found.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nEverything checks out. I'm confident that \\(\\Box = 173\\) is the correct and minimum value.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\Box = 173\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **9. Wrapping Up**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy expanding the expression and matching coefficients, we established that \\(ab = 26\\) and \\(a^2 + b^2 = \\Box\\). Testing different integer pairs \\((a, b)\\) that satisfy \\(ab = 26\\), we found that \\((a, b) = (2, 13)\\) yields the minimum \\(\\Box\\) value of 173 while ensuring all variables are distinct integers.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nExploring multiple pairs and verifying each step ensured accuracy. Starting with a straightforward strategy and being open to adjusting led us to the correct solution efficiently.\n\n---\n\nThat's it! By thinking through each step, checking our work, and being flexible with our approach, we've successfully solved the problem.",
  "ground_truth": "We expand the left side to get $(abx^2+(a^2+b^2)x+ab)=26x^2+\\Box\\cdot x+26$. The coefficients of like terms must be equal, so that means $ab=26$. The only possibilities for $(a,b)$ are $(2,13)$, $(-2,-13)$, $(13,2)$, $(-13,-2)$, $(1,26)$, $(26,1)$, $(-1,-26)$, or $(-26,-1)$. Since we're looking for $\\Box=a^2+b^2$, we just compute $1^2+26^2 = 677$ and $2^2+13^2=173$, the minimum of which is $\\boxed{173}$."
