  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, reflecting and brainstorming along the way just like how a human brain would tackle it.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we need to find the smallest positive integer \\( y \\) such that the product \\( xy \\) is a perfect cube, where \\( x = 7 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 48 \\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This reminds me of problems involving perfect cubes and prime factorization.\n- Maybe I need to factor \\( x \\) into its prime components to see what's missing for a perfect cube.\n- I\u2019m not entirely sure, but exploring prime factors seems like a good starting point.\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Factor \\( x \\) into its prime factors to determine what\u2019s needed to make \\( xy \\) a perfect cube.\n  \n2. **Exploring Exponents:**\n   - Check the exponents in the prime factorization to see which need adjusting to make them multiples of 3 (since it's a cube).\n\n3. **Alternative Methods:**\n   - Maybe using cube roots or properties of cubes, but that feels more complicated.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Prime factorization seems straightforward and aligns with similar problems I've seen before. Let's start there and see if it works.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating \\( x \\)**\n\nFirst, let's compute \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 7 \\times 24 \\times 48\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Multiplying smaller numbers first might make it easier.\n\n\\[\n24 \\times 48 = 1152 \\\\\n7 \\times 1152 = 8064 \\\\\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( x = 8064 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Looks good so far. No calculation errors.\n\n### **Step 2: Prime Factorization of \\( x \\)**\n\nNow, let's factor 8064 into its prime components.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- I\u2019ll start by dividing by the smallest primes: 2, then 3, and so on.\n\n**Process:**\n\n1. **Divide by 2:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n8064 \\div 2 &= 4032 \\\\\n4032 \\div 2 &= 2016 \\\\\n2016 \\div 2 &= 1008 \\\\\n1008 \\div 2 &= 504 \\\\\n504 \\div 2 &= 252 \\\\\n252 \\div 2 &= 126 \\\\\n126 \\div 2 &= 63 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n- That\u2019s seven factors of 2.\n\n2. **Divide by 3:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n63 \\div 3 &= 21 \\\\\n21 \\div 3 &= 7 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n- Two factors of 3.\n\n3. **Remaining Factor:**\n\n\\[\n7 \\div 7 = 1\n\\]\n\n- One factor of 7.\n\n**Prime Factorization:**\n\n\\[\n8064 = 2^7 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Multiplying back to ensure correctness:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2^7 &= 128 \\\\\n128 \\times 3^2 &= 128 \\times 9 = 1152 \\\\\n1152 \\times 7 &= 8064 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Yup, that checks out!\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing for Perfect Cube**\n\nA perfect cube requires all exponents in its prime factorization to be multiples of 3.\n\n**Current Exponents:**\n- \\( 2^7 \\)\n- \\( 3^2 \\)\n- \\( 7^1 \\)\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- I need to adjust each exponent to the nearest multiple of 3.\n- This reminds me of balancing equations\u2014adding what's missing.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **For \\( 2^7 \\):**\n  - Nearest multiple of 3 is 9.\n  - Need \\( 9 - 7 = 2 \\) more twos.\n\n- **For \\( 3^2 \\):**\n  - Nearest multiple of 3 is 3.\n  - Need \\( 3 - 2 = 1 \\) more three.\n\n- **For \\( 7^1 \\):**\n  - Nearest multiple of 3 is 3.\n  - Need \\( 3 - 1 = 2 \\) more sevens.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Does this make sense? Adding exponents should align them to be multiples of 3, which is necessary for a perfect cube.\n\n### **Step 4: Determining \\( y \\)**\n\nNow, let's construct \\( y \\) using the additional prime factors needed:\n\n\\[\ny = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^2\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2^2 &= 4 \\\\\n3^1 &= 3 \\\\\n7^2 &= 49 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = 4 \\times 3 \\times 49 = 12 \\times 49 = 588\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait a minute\u2014let's double-check this multiplication to avoid errors.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n4 \\times 3 &= 12 \\\\\n12 \\times 49 &= 12 \\times (50 - 1) = 600 - 12 = 588 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- That seems correct.\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying \\( xy \\) is a Perfect Cube**\n\nLet's multiply \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to ensure the product is a perfect cube.\n\n\\[\nxy = 8064 \\times 588\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Maybe breaking it down into prime factors will make it easier to verify.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n8064 &= 2^7 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\\\\n588 &= 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^2 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Multiplying Prime Factors:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nxy &= (2^7 \\times 2^2) \\times (3^2 \\times 3^1) \\times (7^1 \\times 7^2) \\\\\n&= 2^{9} \\times 3^{3} \\times 7^{3} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- All exponents are now multiples of 3, which confirms that \\( xy \\) is a perfect cube.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Does \\( 2^9 \\times 3^3 \\times 7^3 \\) simplify to a cube?\n\n\\[\n(2^3 \\times 3 \\times 7)^3 = 84^3\n\\]\n\n- Yes, it does. So, \\( xy \\) is indeed a perfect cube.\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n- **Does the solution make sense?** Yes, by adjusting the exponents to be multiples of 3, we've ensured that \\( xy \\) is a perfect cube.\n- **Did the approach work?** Absolutely. Prime factorization was an effective strategy here.\n- **Is there a better way?** Given the problem, prime factorization is straightforward and ensures accuracy, so I believe it's the best method.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>solution  \ny = 588  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- By systematically breaking down the problem and checking each step, I ensured the correctness of the solution.\n- Prime factorization proved to be a reliable method for determining the necessary factors to make \\( xy \\) a perfect cube.",
  "ground_truth": "Begin by factoring $24$ and $48$. We have $24=2^3\\cdot3$ and $48=2^4\\cdot3$, so $$7\\cdot24\\cdot48=7\\cdot(2^3\\cdot3)\\cdot(2^4\\cdot3)=2^7\\cdot3^2\\cdot7.$$For a number to be a perfect cube, every prime factor must have an exponent that is a multiple of $3$. The next multiple of $3$ bigger than $7$ is $9$, so we need a $2^2$ to reach $9$ in the exponent. We need one more factor of $3$ to reach $3^3$. We need another $7^2$ to reach $3$ in the exponent of $7$. This gives a smallest number of $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot7^2=\\boxed{588}$."
