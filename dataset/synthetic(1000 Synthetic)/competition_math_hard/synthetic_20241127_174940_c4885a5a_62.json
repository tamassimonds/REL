  "solution": "Alright, let's put everything together into a **coherent and complete solution** while maintaining the original insights, reflections, and adjustments. We'll walk through the problem naturally, just like brainstorming and correcting our approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we have a \\(2 \\times 2003\\) rectangle made up of unit squares. The middle unit square of each row is shaded. We need to find the probability that a randomly chosen rectangle does **not** include a shaded square.\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n- **Symmetry Consideration:** The rectangle is long and narrow, so symmetry might play a role.\n- **Total Rectangles:** Calculating the total number of rectangles seems like a good starting point.\n- **Avoid Shaded Squares:** Maybe count rectangles that avoid the shaded squares directly.\n- **Probability Approach:** Think about the ratio of unshaded to total rectangles.\n\nHonestly, at first glance, this seems like a counting problem. But given the large size (2003), I suspect there\u2019s a more elegant method than brute force.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Total Number of Rectangles**\n\nLet\u2019s start by finding the total number of rectangles in the \\(2 \\times 2003\\) grid.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- A rectangle is defined by choosing two horizontal and two vertical lines.\n- There are 3 horizontal lines (top, middle, bottom) and 2004 vertical lines (boundaries and dividers).\n\nSo, the total number of rectangles is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{2004}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{3}{2} = 3,\\quad \\binom{2004}{2} = \\frac{2004 \\times 2003}{2} = 2,007,006\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Rectangles} = 3 \\times 2,007,006 = 6,021,018\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This seems correct. We\u2019ve accounted for all possible rectangles in the grid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Rectangles That Avoid Shaded Squares**\n\nNow, I need to calculate the number of rectangles that do **not** include any shaded squares. Each row has one shaded square, so let's consider each row separately.\n\n**Initial Approach:** \n\n- **Separate Rows:** Consider rectangles within each row that avoid the shaded square.\n- **Multi-Row Rectangles:** Consider rectangles that span both rows but still avoid shaded squares.\n\n**Actually, Looking at This Again...** Counting rectangles that avoid shaded squares directly might be too complex due to overlapping cases. Maybe it\u2019s better to handle each case separately or find a different approach.\n\n**Alternative Idea:** Perhaps it\u2019s easier to first find the number of rectangles that **do** include shaded squares and subtract from the total.\n\n**Wait a Minute...** That\u2019s still tricky because rectangles can overlap the shaded areas in different ways. I need a clearer strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Adjusting Strategy with Complementary Counting**\n\nInstead of directly counting rectangles that avoid shaded squares, let\u2019s focus on those that **do** include shaded squares and subtract from the total.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Calculate the probability of a rectangle including a shaded square.\n- Then, subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability of avoiding shaded squares.\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, it simplifies the problem by focusing on the complementary probability.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating Rectangles Including Shaded Squares**\n\nLet\u2019s find the number of rectangles that include at least one shaded square.\n\n**Brainstorm:** \n\n- Each row has one shaded square.\n- Calculate how many rectangles include these shaded squares.\n\n**Potential Issue:** Rectangles that span both rows might be double-counted if they include shaded squares in both rows.\n\n**Hmm, Maybe I Need to Back Up and Try...** I need to ensure I\u2019m not double-counting rectangles that span both rows. Let\u2019s think this through carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Let\u2019s Try Counting Rectangles in Each Row Separately**\n\nLet\u2019s focus on one row first. Each row has one shaded square. We\u2019ll calculate how many rectangles include this shaded square.\n\n**Reflection:** By handling each row separately, we can avoid double-counting.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Single Row Calculation:** Find the number of rectangles that include the shaded square in one row.\n- **Extend to Both Rows:** Since both rows are identical, multiply by the number of rows.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating Rectangles in One Row with Shaded Squares**\n\nA rectangle in the bottom row is determined by choosing any two of the 2004 vertical segments as sides of the rectangle. Therefore:\n\n\\[\nn = \\binom{2004}{2} = \\frac{2004 \\times 2003}{2} = 1,002 \\times 2,003\n\\]\n\nNow, let\u2019s find the number of rectangles in the bottom row that **contain** a shaded square.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The shaded square divides the row into two parts.\n- A rectangle containing the shaded square must have one side to the left and one side to the right of the shaded square.\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[\nm = 1002 \\times 1002 = 1,004,004\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, there are \\(1,004,004\\) rectangles in one row that include the shaded square.\n\n**Wait, That Can\u2019t Be Right Because...** I\u2019m only considering rectangles within a single row. What about rectangles that span both rows?\n\n**Oh! This Reminds Me of...** I need to account for rectangles that span both rows but still include shaded squares.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Incorporating Rectangles Spanning Both Rows**\n\nThere are \\(n\\) rectangles spanning both rows, and similarly, \\(m\\) of these include a shaded square. Therefore:\n\n- **Total Rectangles Including Shaded Squares:** \\(3m\\)\n- **Total Rectangles:** \\(3n\\)\n\nThus, the probability that a rectangle includes a shaded square is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3m}{3n} = \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{1002^2}{1002 \\times 2003} = \\frac{1002}{2003}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Including Shaded Square}) = \\frac{1002}{2003}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that a rectangle does **not** include a shaded square is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{No Shaded Square}) = 1 - \\frac{1002}{2003} = \\frac{2003 - 1002}{2003} = \\frac{1001}{2003}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** This fraction simplifies correctly, and considering the problem's symmetry, it makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Validating the Approach**\n\nLet\u2019s briefly revisit the approach to ensure everything aligns.\n\n- **Total Rectangles:** Calculated as \\(3n\\).\n- **Rectangles Including Shaded Squares:** Calculated as \\(3m\\).\n- **Probability Computation:** Subtracted the ratio \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) from 1 to find the desired probability.\n\n**Reflection:** By breaking down the problem into single rows and accounting for overlapping rectangles, the approach remains consistent and accurate.\n\n**Random Insight:** Initially focusing only on single rows led to an incomplete solution, but adjusting to include both rows corrected the oversight.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>solution\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1001}{2003}}\n\\]\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** \n\nAfter revisiting the initial approach and recognizing the need to account for rectangles spanning both rows, I adjusted the strategy to calculate the probability correctly. By considering both single-row and multi-row rectangles, I arrived at the correct probability of \\(\\frac{1001}{2003}\\) for selecting a rectangle that does not include a shaded square. Throughout the process, continuous reflection and validation ensured the accuracy of the final solution.",
  "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of rectangles contained in the bottom row, and let $m$ be the number of rectangles in the bottom row which contain a shaded square.  There are $n$ rectangles contained in the top row and $n$ rectangles spanning both rows, so there are $3n$ rectangles in the figure.  Similarly, $3m$ rectangles contain a shaded square.  The probability that a rectangle chosen at random includes a shaded square is $3m/3n=m/n$.\n\nA rectangle contained in the bottom row is determined by choosing any two of the 2004 vertical segments as sides of the rectangle.  Therefore, $n=\\binom{2004}{2}=\\frac{2004\\cdot 2003}{2}=1002\\cdot2003$.  A rectangle in the bottom row which contains a shaded square is determined by choosing one side from among the 1002 vertical segments to the left of the shaded square and one side from among the 1002 vertical segments to the right of the shaded square.  Therefore, $m=1002^2$.  The probability that a rectangle chosen at random from the figure does not include a shaded square is $1-\\dfrac{m}{n}=1-\\dfrac{1002^2}{1002\\cdot 2003}=1-\\dfrac{1002}{2003}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1001}{2003}}$."
