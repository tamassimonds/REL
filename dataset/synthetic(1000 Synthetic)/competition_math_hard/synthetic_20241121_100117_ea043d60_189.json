  "solution": "Absolutely, let's put this together into a cohesive and complete solution, maintaining the original user\u2019s thinking process but presenting it more concisely. I'll still brainstorm, reflect, and verify to ensure clarity and correctness. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, tackling the inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{24} + \\left|x - \\frac{11}{48}\\right| < \\frac{5}{16}\n\\]\n\nAt first glance, this involves absolute values and inequalities, which typically suggest handling multiple cases. Before proceeding, let's brainstorm possible strategies:\n\n1. **Isolate the Absolute Value:** Simplify the inequality by getting the absolute value term alone.\n2. **Consider Two Cases:** Break down the absolute value into two separate inequalities.\n3. **Verify with Test Points:** Check if the solution interval satisfies the original inequality.\n\nHmm, isolating the absolute value seems like a straightforward starting point. Let\u2019s begin there.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Isolate the Absolute Value**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo simplify the inequality, let's get the absolute value term by itself.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{24} + \\left|x - \\frac{11}{48}\\right| < \\frac{5}{16}\n\\]\n\n**Action:**  \nSubtract \\(\\frac{5}{24}\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\left|x - \\frac{11}{48}\\right| < \\frac{5}{16} - \\frac{5}{24}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \nNeed to subtract fractions. Let\u2019s find a common denominator:\n\n- Denominators: 16 and 24\n- Least Common Denominator (LCD): 48\n\nConvert both fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{16} = \\frac{5 \\times 3}{16 \\times 3} = \\frac{15}{48}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{24} = \\frac{5 \\times 2}{24 \\times 2} = \\frac{10}{48}\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15}{48} - \\frac{10}{48} = \\frac{5}{48}\n\\]\n\n**Result:**  \n\\[\n\\left|x - \\frac{11}{48}\\right| < \\frac{5}{48}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, that worked out nicely. The inequality is now simpler, confirming that isolating the absolute value was a good first step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Consider Two Cases to Remove the Absolute Value**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAbsolute value inequalities can be split into two separate inequalities to account for both positive and negative scenarios.\n\n\\[\n\\left|x - \\frac{11}{48}\\right| < \\frac{5}{48}\n\\]\n\nThis translates to:\n\n1. \\(x - \\frac{11}{48} < \\frac{5}{48}\\)\n2. \\(x - \\frac{11}{48} > -\\frac{5}{48}\\)\n\n**Action:**  \nLet's solve each inequality separately.\n\n---\n\n**Case 1: \\(x - \\frac{11}{48} < \\frac{5}{48}\\)**\n\n**Calculation:**  \nAdd \\(\\frac{11}{48}\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\nx < \\frac{5}{48} + \\frac{11}{48} = \\frac{16}{48}\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**  \n\\(\\frac{16}{48} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) (dividing numerator and denominator by 16)\n\n\\[\nx < \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat was straightforward. Now, let's move on to the second case.\n\n---\n\n**Case 2: \\(x - \\frac{11}{48} > -\\frac{5}{48}\\)**\n\n**Calculation:**  \nAdd \\(\\frac{11}{48}\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\nx > -\\frac{5}{48} + \\frac{11}{48} = \\frac{6}{48}\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**  \n\\(\\frac{6}{48} = \\frac{1}{8}\\) (dividing numerator and denominator by 6)\n\n\\[\nx > \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth cases are solved, and the inequalities make sense. It seems like the solution is an interval between \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Two Cases into an Interval**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince \\(x\\) must satisfy both conditions simultaneously, the solution is the intersection of the two intervals:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8} < x < \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**In Interval Notation:**  \n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{3} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis interval represents all \\(x\\) values that satisfy the original inequality. To ensure correctness, let\u2019s perform a quick check.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Solution with Test Points**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIt's always a good idea to verify the solution by plugging in test values within and outside the interval to see if they satisfy the original inequality.\n\n**Action:**  \n- **Test Point Inside the Interval:**  \n  Let's choose \\(x = \\frac{1}{4}\\), which is between \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\left| \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{11}{48} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{12}{48} - \\frac{11}{48} \\right| = \\frac{1}{48}\n  \\]\n  \n  Now, check:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{5}{24} + \\frac{1}{48} = \\frac{10}{48} + \\frac{1}{48} = \\frac{11}{48} < \\frac{15}{48} \\quad \\text{(since } \\frac{5}{16} = \\frac{15}{48} \\text{)}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Conclusion:**  \n  The inequality holds for \\(x = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n- **Test Point Outside the Interval:**  \n  Let's choose \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\), which is greater than \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\left| \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{11}{48} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{24}{48} - \\frac{11}{48} \\right| = \\frac{13}{48}\n  \\]\n  \n  Now, check:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{5}{24} + \\frac{13}{48} = \\frac{10}{48} + \\frac{13}{48} = \\frac{23}{48} > \\frac{15}{48}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Conclusion:**  \n  The inequality does not hold for \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe test points confirm that the solution interval is correct\u2014points inside the interval satisfy the inequality, while points outside do not.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Answer**\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nAfter exploring different strategies, isolating the absolute value and considering two cases proved effective. The solution was verified using test points, ensuring the correctness of the interval.\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\\[\n\\text{The solution is: } \\left( \\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{3} \\right)\n\\]  \n</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nThis approach not only provided the correct solution but also ensured its validity through verification. Brainstorming, applying multiple strategies, and reflecting at each step were crucial in arriving at the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically isolating the absolute value, considering both cases of the inequality, and verifying with test points, we confidently determined the solution interval:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{3} \\right)\n\\]\n\nThis methodical approach ensures accuracy and deepens understanding, making it an effective problem-solving strategy.\n\n---\n\nHow does this look?

  "ground_truth": "We can make our work easier by rewriting all fractions in the inequality so that they have a common denominator of $48$: $$\\frac{10}{48} + \\left|x-\\frac{11}{48}\\right| < \\frac{15}{48}$$Then we subtract $\\frac{10}{48}$ from both sides: $$\\left|x-\\frac{11}{48}\\right| < \\frac{5}{48}$$The expression on the left side is the positive difference between $x$ and $\\frac{11}{48}$. So, the inequality says that $x$ is strictly between $\\frac{11}{48}-\\frac{5}{48}$ and $\\frac{11}{48}+\\frac{5}{48}$. Simplifying these expressions and writing our answer in interval notation, we have $x\\in\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{1}{8},\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}$."
