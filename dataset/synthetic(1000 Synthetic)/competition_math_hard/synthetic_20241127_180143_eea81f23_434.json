  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, exploring different strategies, checking my work, and making adjustments as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{8x} \\cdot \\sqrt{10x} \\cdot \\sqrt{3x} \\cdot \\sqrt{15x} = 15\n\\]\n\nMy initial reaction is that this involves multiple square roots and products\u2014something I\u2019ve seen before in algebra problems. I think that simplifying the expression under the square roots or factoring out common terms might help. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start, so I'll brainstorm a few strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Simplify Each Square Root Individually:** Maybe breaking down each square root to see if there are common factors.\n   \n2. **Multiply Under the Square Roots:** Perhaps combining the terms under a single square root could simplify things.\n   \n3. **Express in Terms of Exponents:** Square roots can be expressed with exponents, so using exponent rules might be helpful.\n   \n4. **Assume a Value for \\( x \\):** Plugging in a sample value to see if it works could give me insight, but it might not lead to a general solution.\n\nHmm, **multiplying under the square roots** seems promising because it might allow me to combine terms and simplify the expression. I'll start with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Attempting Strategy 1: Multiply Under the Square Roots**\n\nLet\u2019s try to combine the square roots:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{8x} \\cdot \\sqrt{10x} = \\sqrt{(8x) \\cdot (10x)} = \\sqrt{80x^2}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3x} \\cdot \\sqrt{15x} = \\sqrt{(3x) \\cdot (15x)} = \\sqrt{45x^2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the original equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{80x^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{45x^2} = 15\n\\]\n\nCombining these:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(80x^2) \\cdot (45x^2)} = \\sqrt{3600x^4}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3600x^4} = 60x^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n\\[\n60x^2 = 15\n\\]\n\nWait a minute\u2014this seems too straightforward. Let's solve it anyway to see if it makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the Simplified Equation**\n\nDivide both sides by 60:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{15}{60} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Combining the expressions on the left-hand side, we obtain \\[\\begin{aligned} \\sqrt{8x}\\cdot\\sqrt{10x}\\cdot\\sqrt{3x}\\cdot\\sqrt{15x}&=15 \\\\ \n\\sqrt{3600x^4} &= 15 \\\\\n60x^2 &= 15 \\\\\nx^2 &= \\frac{15}{60} = \\frac{1}{4}.\\end{aligned} \\]Since $x$ must be positive, the only solution is $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
