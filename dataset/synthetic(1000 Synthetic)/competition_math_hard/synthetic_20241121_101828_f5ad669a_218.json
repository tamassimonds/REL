  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just like I naturally would when tackling it for the first time. I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, and reflect along the way to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's see where my initial thoughts lead me.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**User:** Solve for \\( z \\) in the equation \\( 1 - iz = -1 + iz \\), where \\( i^2 = -1 \\). Simplify your answer as much as possible.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- Okay, this involves complex numbers since \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n- The equation has \\( z \\) tied up with \\( i \\). \n- It looks like both sides have similar terms involving \\( iz \\). Maybe I can rearrange terms to isolate \\( z \\).\n- Hmm, this reminds me of linear equations, but with complex components.\n\nI think I need to brainstorm different strategies to approach this.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Rearrange Terms:**  \n   - Move all terms involving \\( z \\) to one side and constants to the other.\n   - This is similar to solving linear equations, so it might work.\n\n2. **Factor Out \\( z \\):**  \n   - If I can factor \\( z \\), it might simplify the equation.\n\n3. **Check for No Solution or Infinite Solutions:**  \n   - Given the symmetry, maybe there's something unique about \\( z \\).\n\n4. **Graphical Interpretation:**  \n   - Visualizing complex numbers on the complex plane could provide insights, but it might be overkill for this equation.\n\n**Reflection:** \n- Rearranging terms seems the most straightforward. I'll start there and see if it leads to a solution. If not, I can try factoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Rearranging Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's move all terms involving \\( z \\) to one side and constants to the other.\n\n**Write it Out:**\n\\[\n1 - iz = -1 + iz\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( iz \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n1 - iz - iz = -1\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n1 - 2iz = -1\n\\]\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n- Wait, that looks better. I managed to combine the \\( iz \\) terms. Now I have constants on one side and \\( iz \\) on the other.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This step worked out nicely. I reduced the equation to have fewer terms. Let's proceed by isolating \\( iz \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Isolating \\( iz \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to get \\( iz \\) by itself to solve for \\( z \\).\n\n**Write it Out:**\n\\[\n1 - 2iz = -1\n\\]\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\\[\n-2iz = -1 - 1\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n-2iz = -2\n\\]\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n- Okay, now I have \\( -2iz = -2 \\). This is getting closer to isolating \\( z \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Does this make sense? If I divide both sides by \\( -2i \\), I should get \\( z \\). Let's see.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\( z \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To isolate \\( z \\), I'll divide both sides by \\( -2i \\).\n\n**Write it Out:**\n\\[\nz = \\frac{-2}{-2i}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator and denominator:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{2}{2i}\n\\]\n\nReduce the fraction:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{1}{i}\n\\]\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n- Hmm, \\( z = \\frac{1}{i} \\). But I remember from complex numbers that it's usually better to express this without \\( i \\) in the denominator. Let's rationalize it.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- It\u2019s always a good practice to have \\( i \\) in the numerator. Let\u2019s proceed to rationalize the denominator.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Rationalizing the Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Multiply the numerator and denominator by \\( i \\) to eliminate \\( i \\) from the denominator.\n\n**Write it Out:**\n\\[\nz = \\frac{1}{i} \\times \\frac{i}{i} = \\frac{i}{i^2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( i^2 = -1 \\):\n\\[\nz = \\frac{i}{-1} = -i\n\\]\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n- Oh! That simplifies nicely to \\( z = -i \\). This looks clean and makes sense.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Let me substitute \\( z = -i \\) back into the original equation to verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Substitute \\( z = -i \\) into the original equation to see if both sides are equal.\n\n**Write it Out:**\n\\[\n1 - i(-i) = -1 + i(-i)\n\\]\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\\[\n1 - (-i^2) = -1 + (-i^2)\n\\]\n\nSince \\( i^2 = -1 \\):\n\\[\n1 - 1 = -1 + 1\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n0 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n- Perfect! Both sides are equal, so \\( z = -i \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The solution checks out. All the steps led logically to the correct answer. \n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Alternate Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Initially, I used rearranging terms, which worked well. But let's briefly consider if factoring could have been another approach.\n\n**Alternate Strategy: Factoring**\n- Starting from \\( 1 - iz = -1 + iz \\), if I subtract \\( iz \\) from both sides:\n  \\[\n  1 - iz - iz = -1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  1 - 2iz = -1\n  \\]\n- This leads to the same simplified equation. Factoring \\( z \\) doesn't seem necessary here since rearranging already provided a straightforward path.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Rearranging terms was the most efficient strategy. Factoring would have been redundant in this case.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Check:**\n- The solution \\( z = -i \\) satisfies the original equation.\n- Each step logically follows from the previous one, and verification confirms correctness.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- By rearranging terms to isolate \\( z \\) and simplifying, I arrived at the solution \\( z = -i \\). Verifying the solution ensured its validity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:** Rearranging terms to isolate \\( z \\).\n- **Verification:** Substituting back into the original equation confirmed the solution.\n- **Alternate Strategies:** Briefly considered factoring, but it wasn't necessary.\n- **Final Solution:** \\( z = -i \\).\n\nBy reflecting and checking each step, I ensured the correctness of the solution while exploring different strategies to confirm the approach was optimal.",
