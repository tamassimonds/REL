  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and brainstorm our way through it, just like I would if I were tackling it for the first time.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we have points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) on the parabola \\( y = 4x^2 + 7x - 1 \\), and the origin \\((0,0)\\) is the midpoint of the line segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\). We need to find the square of the length of \\( \\overline{AB} \\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis reminds me of problems involving midpoints and parabolas. I know that if the origin is the midpoint, there's a relationship between the coordinates of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). Maybe I can use the midpoint formula? But I'm not entirely sure how to incorporate the parabola's equation yet.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Midpoint Formula:**  \n   If the origin is the midpoint, then the average of the coordinates of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) should be zero.\n   - Pros: Direct application of the midpoint concept.\n   - Cons: Might lead to a system of equations that's tricky to solve.\n\n2. **Parameterize the Points on the Parabola:**  \n   Assume \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) have coordinates \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) that satisfy the parabola's equation.\n   - Pros: Keeps everything in terms of known equations.\n   - Cons: Could become algebraically intense.\n\n3. **Symmetry of the Parabola:**  \n   Maybe exploit the symmetry of the parabola to simplify the problem.\n   - Pros: Symmetry can often reduce the complexity.\n   - Cons: Not sure if it's directly applicable here since the parabola isn't centered at the origin.\n\n**Which Strategy to Try First?**  \nI'll start with the **midpoint formula** because it directly relates to the condition given in the problem. If that leads to a dead end or becomes too complicated, I can reconsider and maybe look into parameterizing the points.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Midpoint Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf the origin is the midpoint of \\( \\overline{AB} \\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right) = (0, 0)\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two equations:\n\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 = 0 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\\[\ny_1 + y_2 = 0 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, the first equation \\( x_1 + x_2 = 0 \\) suggests that \\( x_2 = -x_1 \\). That\u2019s interesting because it implies that points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are symmetrically located around the origin along the x-axis.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, since the origin is the midpoint, the x-coordinates should indeed be negatives of each other.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Using the Parabola\u2019s Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBoth points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) lie on the parabola, so their coordinates must satisfy:\n\n\\[\ny_1 = 4x_1^2 + 7x_1 - 1\n\\]\n\\[\ny_2 = 4x_2^2 + 7x_2 - 1\n\\]\n\nBut from Equation 1, \\( x_2 = -x_1 \\). Let's substitute \\( x_2 = -x_1 \\) into the equation for \\( y_2 \\):\n\n\\[\ny_2 = 4(-x_1)^2 + 7(-x_1) - 1 = 4x_1^2 - 7x_1 - 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute, I also have Equation 2: \\( y_1 + y_2 = 0 \\). Let's see what happens if I plug \\( y_1 \\) and \\( y_2 \\) into this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying Using Equation 2**\n\n\\[\ny_1 + y_2 = \\left( 4x_1^2 + 7x_1 - 1 \\right) + \\left( 4x_1^2 - 7x_1 - 1 \\right) = 8x_1^2 - 2 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( x_1 \\):**\n\n\\[\n8x_1^2 - 2 = 0 \\implies 8x_1^2 = 2 \\implies x_1^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies x_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ or } x_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems correct. Since \\( x_1^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\), \\( x_1 \\) can be either \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\). Consequently, \\( x_2 = -x_1 \\), which aligns with Equation 1.\n\n**Check:**  \nLet's verify:  \nIf \\( x_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\), then \\( x_2 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\).  \nIf \\( x_1 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\), then \\( x_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\).  \nBoth cases satisfy \\( x_1 + x_2 = 0 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding Corresponding \\( y \\)-Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, let's find \\( y_1 \\) and \\( y_2 \\) using the parabola's equation.\n\nFor \\( x_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\):\n\n\\[\ny_1 = 4\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + 7\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) - 1 = 1 + \\frac{7}{2} - 1 = \\frac{9}{2} - 1 = \\frac{7}{2}\n\\]\n\nAnd since \\( y_1 + y_2 = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\ny_2 = -\\frac{7}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat makes sense. The y-coordinates are negatives of each other, which aligns with the origin being the midpoint.\n\n**Check:**  \nQuick verification:  \n\\( y_1 + y_2 = \\frac{7}{2} - \\frac{7}{2} = 0 \\).  \nSo, everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Length of \\( \\overline{AB} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, let's find the length of \\( \\overline{AB} \\) using the distance formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length of } \\overline{AB} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nBut since \\( x_2 = -x_1 \\) and \\( y_2 = -y_1 \\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{AB} = \\sqrt{(2x_1)^2 + (2y_1)^2} = 2\\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis simplification is neat because it leverages the symmetry of the problem. Let's plug in the values we found.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Substituting Known Values**\n\nWe know:\n\n\\[\nx_1^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\ny_1 = \\frac{7}{2} \\implies y_1^2 = \\left( \\frac{7}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{49}{4}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\overline{AB} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{49}{4}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{50}{4}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{2}} = 2 \\times \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}} = 5\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, the problem asks for the square of the length of \\( \\overline{AB} \\). So, I need to square this result.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, squaring the length will give us the desired quantity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Finding the Square of the Length**\n\n\\[\n(\\overline{AB})^2 = \\left( 5\\sqrt{2} \\right)^2 = 25 \\times 2 = 50\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nEverything seems to align correctly. The calculations are consistent, and the approach logically follows from the problem's conditions.\n\n**Check:**  \nQuick recap:  \n- The origin as the midpoint led us to \\( x_1 + x_2 = 0 \\) and \\( y_1 + y_2 = 0 \\).\n- Substituting into the parabola's equation gave us \\( x_1^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n- Corresponding \\( y \\)-coordinates were \\( \\frac{7}{2} \\) and \\( -\\frac{7}{2} \\).\n- The length calculation yielded \\( 5\\sqrt{2} \\), and squaring it gave us 50.\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> solution:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{50}\n\\]\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe square of the length of \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is **50**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy methodically applying the midpoint formula and leveraging the properties of the parabola, I was able to find the square of the length of \\( \\overline{AB} \\). Initially, I considered multiple strategies, and sticking with the midpoint approach proved effective. Regularly checking each step ensured that the solution was correct and minimized the risk of errors.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore!",
  "ground_truth": "The graph of the parabola is shown below:\n\n[asy]\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(6);\n\nxaxis(-2.5,.75,Ticks(f, 1.0));\n\nyaxis(-5,8,Ticks(f, 2.0));\nreal f(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn 4x^2+7x-1;\n\n}\n\ndraw(graph(f,-2.5,.75));\ndot((.5,3.5));\ndot((-.5,-3.5));\nlabel(\"$A$\", (.5,3.5), E);\nlabel(\"$B$\", (-.5,-3.5), E);\n[/asy]\n\nLet the coordinates of point $A$ be $(x,y)$. Then since the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is the origin, the coordinates of $B$ are $(-x,-y)$. Both of these points must lie on the parabola, so we plug them into the equation for the parabola to get the equations \\begin{align*}\ny&=4x^2+7x-1,\\\\\n-y&=4(-x)^2+7(-x)-1 \\Rightarrow y=-4x^2+7x+1.\n\\end{align*}Setting the two equations equal to eliminate $y$, we have $4x^2+7x-1=-4x^2+7x+1$, or $8x^2=2\\Rightarrow x^2=\\frac{1}{4}$. So $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ (the negative alternative for $x$ gives the same answer) and $y=4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2+7\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)-1=\\frac{7}{2}$. Thus, point $A$ is at $(1/2,7/2)$ and point $B$ is at $(-1/2,-7/2)$. The length of $\\overline{AB}$ is then $\\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(-\\frac{7}{2}-\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2}=\\sqrt{50}$. Hence, $AB^2=\\boxed{50}$."
