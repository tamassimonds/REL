  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and walk through it just like I would if I were solving it by hand. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- We have an **equilateral triangle** with a side length of 12 cm.\n- One side of the triangle is the **diameter of a circle**.\n- There are two small shaded regions, and I need to find the sum of their areas in the form \\(a\\pi - b\\sqrt{c}\\), then compute \\(a + b + c\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- This sounds like a combination of geometry involving triangles and circles.\n- I remember problems where a circle is inscribed or circumscribed around a triangle, but here, a side is the diameter\u2014interesting twist.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Circle's Area:** Since a side is the diameter, maybe start with the circle's properties.\n2. **Explore the Shaded Regions:** Identify what those shaded regions are\u2014possibly sectors or segments of the circle.\n3. **Look for Symmetry:** Since it's an equilateral triangle, symmetry might help simplify the problem.\n4. **Decompose the Areas:** Consider breaking down the shaded regions into familiar shapes.\n\n**Reflecting:**\n\n- I'm not entirely sure which strategy will work best. It might be helpful to sketch the problem mentally to visualize the components.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the First Strategy: Circle's Properties**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let's begin by looking at the circle since the diameter is given. \n- The diameter of the circle is 12 cm, so the **radius \\(r\\) is 6 cm**.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- \\(r = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\\) cm\u2014makes sense.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n- The **area of the circle** is \n\\[\nA = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (6)^2 = 36\\pi \\text{ cm}^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This gives us the total area of the circle, but I need to relate this to the shaded regions. \n- Maybe the shaded areas are parts of the circle's area that intersect with the triangle.\n\n---\n\n### **Identifying the Shaded Regions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The shaded regions are likely parts of the circle that lie outside the triangle.\n- Since the triangle is equilateral and the circle's diameter is one of its sides, the circle is touching the triangle at specific points.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- Could the shaded regions be **circular segments**?\n- Or perhaps they are **sectors minus triangular areas**?\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- It might be helpful to consider the **angles involved** since it's an equilateral triangle.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Angles and Symmetry**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- In an **equilateral triangle**, all angles are **60 degrees**.\n- The circle's center lies at one of the triangle's vertices (since the diameter is a side).\n\n**Visualizing:**\n\n- The circle is centered at one vertex, and its diameter lies along one side.\n- This means the circle extends into the interior of the triangle, creating overlap areas (the shaded regions).\n\n**Checking Understanding:**\n\n- So, the shaded regions are where the circle extends beyond the triangle's other sides.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n- Let's consider the **central angles** corresponding to the shaded regions.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating Central Angles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Each shaded region corresponds to a **60-degree angle** at the circle's center because the triangle is equilateral.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Total circle is 360 degrees; there are two shaded regions each covering 60 degrees.\n- Makes sense: \\(2 \\times 60^\\circ = 120^\\circ\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- So, the **total angle** covered by the two shaded regions is **120 degrees**.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating the Areas of the Shaded Regions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Each shaded region can be viewed as a **sector** of the circle minus the overlapping triangular area.\n\n**Brainstorming Steps:**\n\n1. **Compute the Area of Each Sector:** Use the central angle to find the sector's area.\n2. **Subtract the Triangle's Area:** Remove the part of the triangle that overlaps with the sector.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n#### **Step 1: Calculate the Area of One Sector**\n\n- Each sector has a central angle of 60 degrees.\n- Area of a sector:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{\\theta}{360^\\circ} \\times \\pi r^2 = \\frac{60^\\circ}{360^\\circ} \\times 36\\pi = 6\\pi \\text{ cm}^2\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of the circle's area\u2014seems right since 60 degrees is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of 360 degrees.\n\n#### **Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Overlapping Triangle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The overlapping triangle is an **equilateral triangle** with sides equal to the circle's radius (6 cm).\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n- Area of an equilateral triangle:  \n  \\[\n  A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} (6)^2 = 9\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 36 = 9\\sqrt{3} \\)\u2014calculations look good.\n\n#### **Step 3: Calculate the Area of One Shaded Region**\n\n- Area of shaded region = Area of sector \u2013 Area of overlapping triangle:  \n  \\[\n  6\\pi - 9\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This is the area for **one** shaded region. Since there are **two** such regions, we'll need to double this.\n\n#### **Step 4: Total Area of Both Shaded Regions**\n\n- Total shaded area:  \n  \\[\n  2 \\times (6\\pi - 9\\sqrt{3}) = 12\\pi - 18\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Multiplying both components by 2 seems straightforward, so it should be correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Expressing in the Required Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The final expression is already in the form \\(a\\pi - b\\sqrt{c}\\):  \n  \\[\n  12\\pi - 18\\sqrt{3}\n  \\]\n- Here, \\(a = 12\\), \\(b = 18\\), and \\(c = 3\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Assigning values looks correct based on the expression.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Calculation: \\(a + b + c\\)**\n\n\\[\na + b + c = 12 + 18 + 3 = 33\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n\n- The components add up correctly.\n- The approach aligns with geometric principles\u2014calculating sectors and subtracting overlapping triangles.\n\n**Alternative Check:**\n\n- Consider if there\u2019s another way to verify\u2014perhaps by calculating the area of the triangle and subtracting unshaded parts, but that seems more complex.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\n\n- Given the straightforward calculation and checks along the way, I\u2019m confident the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying calculations, we've arrived at the correct solution:\n\n\\[\na + b + c = 33\n\\]\n\nThis approach ensures that each component of the problem is thoroughly understood and correctly solved.\n\n### **Coherent and Complete Solution**\n\nLet's put everything together into a polished solution, maintaining the natural thought process but ensuring clarity and completeness.\n\n---\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nWe need to find the sum of the areas of two shaded regions formed by an equilateral triangle and a circle, expressing the area in the form \\(a\\pi - b\\sqrt{c}\\), and then compute \\(a + b + c\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**\n\n- **Given:**\n  - An **equilateral triangle** with a side length of 12 cm.\n  - One side of the triangle serves as the **diameter of a circle**.\n\n- **Objective:**\n  - Determine the sum of the areas of the two shaded regions outside the triangle but within the circle.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The problem involves combining properties of both triangles and circles.\n- Since a side of the triangle is the circle's diameter, the circle's geometry is tightly linked to the triangle.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Circle's Properties**\n\n- **Diameter of the Circle:** 12 cm\n- **Radius (\\(r\\)) of the Circle:**  \n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\text{ cm}\n  \\]\n\n- **Area of the Circle (\\(A\\)):**  \n  \\[\n  A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (6)^2 = 36\\pi \\text{ cm}^2\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Knowing the circle's area is essential, but the focus is on the shaded regions outside the triangle.\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying the Shaded Regions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The shaded areas are parts of the circle that lie outside the equilateral triangle.\n- Since the triangle is equilateral and the circle's diameter is one of its sides, the circle extends into the triangle's interior.\n\n**Visualization:**\n\n- The circle is centered at one of the triangle's vertices.\n- The shaded regions are the areas of the circle that protrude beyond the triangle's other sides.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyzing Angles and Symmetry**\n\n- **Equilateral Triangle Angles:** Each angle is **60 degrees**.\n- **Circle's Central Angles for Shaded Regions:** Each shaded region corresponds to a **60-degree angle** at the circle's center.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Total Angle for Shaded Regions:**  \n  \\[\n  2 \\times 60^\\circ = 120^\\circ\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Understanding that the total angle covered by the shaded regions is **120 degrees** helps in calculating their areas.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Areas of the Shaded Regions**\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n- Each shaded region can be considered as a **sector** of the circle minus the overlapping part of the triangle.\n\n#### **Step 5.1: Calculating the Area of One Sector**\n\n- **Central Angle of Each Sector:** 60 degrees\n- **Area of One Sector (\\(A_{\\text{sector}}\\)):**  \n  \\[\n  A_{\\text{sector}} = \\frac{60^\\circ}{360^\\circ} \\times 36\\pi = 6\\pi \\text{ cm}^2\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Since 60 degrees is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of a full circle, the sector's area is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of the total circle's area\u2014this calculation makes sense.\n\n#### **Step 5.2: Calculating the Area of the Overlapping Triangle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The overlapping part is an **equilateral triangle** with sides equal to the circle's radius (6 cm).\n\n- **Area of the Overlapping Triangle (\\(A_{\\text{triangle}}\\)):**  \n  \\[\n  A_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times (6)^2 = 9\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, the calculation appears correct.\n\n#### **Step 5.3: Calculating the Area of One Shaded Region**\n\n- **Area of One Shaded Region (\\(A_{\\text{shaded}}\\)):**  \n  \\[\n  A_{\\text{shaded}} = A_{\\text{sector}} - A_{\\text{triangle}} = 6\\pi - 9\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This represents the area of one shaded region. Since there are two identical shaded regions, we need to double this area.\n\n#### **Step 5.4: Total Area of Both Shaded Regions**\n\n- **Total Shaded Area (\\(A_{\\text{total}}\\)):**  \n  \\[\n  A_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times (6\\pi - 9\\sqrt{3}) = 12\\pi - 18\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Multiplying both components by 2 is straightforward and correct.\n\n### **Step 6: Expressing in the Required Form**\n\n- **Final Expression:**  \n  \\[\n  12\\pi - 18\\sqrt{3}\n  \\]\n- **Identifying Constants:**  \n  \\[\n  a = 12,\\quad b = 18,\\quad c = 3\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The expression matches the required form \\(a\\pi - b\\sqrt{c}\\), and the constants are correctly identified.\n\n### **Step 7: Calculating \\(a + b + c\\)**\n\n- **Sum:**  \n  \\[\n  a + b + c = 12 + 18 + 3 = 33\n  \\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- Adding the constants yields **33**, which aligns with the solution.\n\n### **Step 8: Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n\n- Each step logically follows from the previous one.\n- The approach effectively decomposes the shaded regions into manageable geometric components.\n\n**Alternative Verification:**\n\n- Consider calculating the area of the equilateral triangle and subtracting the non-shaded parts, but this direct method is more efficient.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\n\n- The calculations are straightforward and consistently checked, ensuring the solution's accuracy.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying calculations, we've successfully determined the sum of the areas of the shaded regions:\n\n\\[\na + b + c = 33\n\\]\n\nThis approach exemplifies effective problem-solving by:\n- **Understanding the Geometry:** Identifying the relationship between the triangle and the circle.\n- **Calculating Relevant Areas:** Decomposing the shaded regions into sectors and triangles.\n- **Ensuring Accuracy:** Continuously checking calculations and reflecting on each step.\n  \nThrough this methodical process, the problem is thoroughly understood and correctly solved, leading to the final answer.",

Also, $\\angle AEB$ cuts off the two arcs $\\widehat{AB}$ and $\\widehat{CD}$, so $m\\angle AEB=(m\\,\\widehat{AB}-m\\,\\widehat{CD}) / 2$.  Subsituting $m\\, \\widehat{AB}=180^\\circ$ and $m\\angle AEB=60^\\circ$ into this equation, we find $m\\,\\widehat{CD}=60^\\circ$.  By symmetry, $\\angle AOC$ and $\\angle DOB$ are congruent, so each one measures $(180-60)/2=60$ degrees.  It follows that $AOC$ and $DOB$ are equilateral triangles.  Therefore, we can find the area of each shaded region by subtracting the area of an equilateral triangle from the area of a sector.\n\nThe area of sector $AOC$ is $\\left(\\frac{m\\angle AOC}{360^\\circ}\\right)\\pi (\\text{radius})^2=\\frac{1}{6}\\pi(6)^2=6\\pi$.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4,$ so the area of triangle $AOC$ is $9\\sqrt{3}$.  In total, the area of the shaded region is $2(6\\pi-9\\sqrt{3})=12\\pi-18\\sqrt{3}.$  Therefore, $(a,b,c)=(12,18,3)$ and $a+b+c=\\boxed{33}$."
