Here's how I would approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe question asks us to find how many integers between 1 and 1000 can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers. \n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n\n- **Difference of Squares Formula:** I remember the algebraic identity:  \n  \\[a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\]\n\n- **Variables as Nonnegative Integers:** Here, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are nonnegative integers, so \\(a \\geq b \\geq 0\\).\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:**  \n  - **1. Direct Calculation:** For each integer from 1 to 1000, check if it can be expressed as \\(a^2 - b^2\\).  \n  - **2. Mathematical Insight:** Perhaps there's a pattern or property that numbers expressible this way share.  \n  - **3. Use of Parity (Even/Odd):** Maybe the difference of squares has specific parity properties that can be exploited.\n\n**Wait a Moment:** Direct calculation seems tedious for 1000 numbers. Perhaps there's a more elegant mathematical approach. Let's brainstorm further.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Direct Calculation**\n\n- **Approach:** For each \\( n \\) from 1 to 1000, try to find nonnegative integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that \\( a^2 - b^2 = n \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** This is straightforward but computationally intensive. It might take too long and isn't practical without a computer program.\n\n**Strategy 2: Analyzing the Formula**\n\n- **Rewrite the Identity:**  \n  \\[a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) = m \\times n\\]  \n  Let\u2019s set \\( a - b = m \\) and \\( a + b = n \\). Therefore,  \n  \\[a = \\frac{m + n}{2},\\ b = \\frac{n - m}{2}\\]\n\n- **Condition:** \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) must be such that \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are both even or both odd (so that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers).\n\n- **Insight:** The product \\( m \\times n \\) can represent any integer that can be factored into two numbers of the same parity (both even or both odd).\n\n**Strategy 3: Using Parity and Divisibility**\n\n- **Parity Analysis:**  \n  - Squares of integers:  \n    - Even number squared is even.  \n    - Odd number squared is odd.\n  - Difference of squares:  \n    - Even - Even = Even  \n    - Odd - Odd = Even  \n    - Odd - Even = Odd  \n    - Even - Odd = Odd\n\n- **Conclusion:** The difference of squares can be either even or odd, depending on the parities of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Wait, Let's Reflect:** This suggests that any integer, regardless of being even or odd, might be expressible as the difference of squares. But is that really the case? Perhaps not all numbers. Let's dig deeper.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2 in Detail**\n\n**Step 1: Setting Up the Equations**\n\nGiven:  \n\\[a^2 - b^2 = n\\]\n\nRewrite as:  \n\\[(a - b)(a + b) = n\\]\n\nLet:  \n\\[(a - b) = m\\]  \n\\[(a + b) = k\\]\n\nThus:  \n\\[m \\times k = n\\]  \n\\[a = \\frac{m + k}{2}\\]  \n\\[b = \\frac{k - m}{2}\\]\n\n**Condition for Integers:**  \n- Both \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) must be either even or odd to ensure \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers.\n\n**Wait, Does This Make Sense?**\n\n- **If \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are both even:**  \n  - Their sum and difference are even, so \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers.\n\n- **If \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are both odd:**  \n  - Their sum and difference are even, so \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers.\n\n- **If one is even and the other is odd:**  \n  - Their sum and difference are odd, so \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are not integers.\n\n**Reflection:** Only products of two numbers with the same parity can be expressed as the difference of squares.\n\n---\n\n### **Identifying Which Integers Fit**\n\n**Key Insight:**  \n- **Numbers That Are Not the Difference of Squares:**  \n  - Numbers that cannot be expressed as the product of two numbers with the same parity.\n\n- **Specifically:**  \n  - **Numbers of the form \\( 4k + 2 \\):**  \n    - These cannot be expressed as \\( m \\times k \\) where both \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) are either even or odd.\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- **Even \\( m \\) and \\( k \\):**  \n  - \\( m \\times k = (2i) \\times (2j) = 4ij \\) \u2192 multiple of 4.\n\n- **Odd \\( m \\) and \\( k \\):**  \n  - \\( m \\times k = (2i + 1) \\times (2j + 1) = 4ij + 2i + 2j + 1 = 4ij + 2(i + j) + 1 \\) \u2192 odd number.\n\n- **Therefore:**  \n  - Multiples of 4 and odd numbers can be expressed as the difference of squares.\n  - However, numbers of the form \\( 4k + 2 \\) cannot.\n\n**Wait, Let's Double-Check:**  \nDoes this mean that only numbers of the form \\( 4k + 2 \\) are excluded?\n\n- **Example Check:**  \n  - **n = 6 (4 \u00d7 1 + 2):**  \n    - Can 6 be expressed as \\( a^2 - b^2 \\)?  \n    - Let's try:  \n      - \\( a = 3, b = 1 \\) \u2192 \\( 3^2 - 1^2 = 9 - 1 = 8 \\) \u2192 Nope.  \n      - \\( a = 3, b = 2 \\) \u2192 \\( 3^2 - 2^2 = 9 - 4 = 5 \\) \u2192 Nope.  \n      - It seems 6 cannot be expressed this way.\n\n**Conclusion:** Numbers of the form \\( 4k + 2 \\) cannot be expressed as the difference of squares.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating the Number of Such Integers**\n\n**Step 1: Count Numbers of the Form \\( 4k + 2 \\) Between 1 and 1000**\n\n- **General Form:**  \n  \\[n = 4k + 2\\]  \n  Where \\( k \\) is a nonnegative integer.\n\n- **Find Maximum \\( k \\):**  \n  \\[4k + 2 \\leq 1000\\]  \n  \\[4k \\leq 998\\]  \n  \\[k \\leq 249.5\\] \u2192 So, \\( k \\) ranges from 0 to 249 (inclusive).\n\n- **Total Count:**  \n  \\[k = 0\\) to \\(249\\) \u2192 Total of \\(250\\) numbers.\n\n**Step 2: Subtract from Total Integers**\n\n- **Total Integers from 1 to 1000:**  \n  \\[1000\\]\n\n- **Integers That Cannot Be Expressed as Difference of Squares:**  \n  \\[250\\] (those of the form \\( 4k + 2 \\))\n\n- **Therefore, Integers That Can Be Expressed as Difference of Squares:**  \n  \\[1000 - 250 = 750\\]\n\n**Wait, Let's Verify:**  \nIs this calculation correct? Let's think about it.\n\n- **Multiple Checks:**  \n  - Does \\( 4k + 2 \\) correctly capture all numbers that cannot be expressed as difference of squares?  \n  - Are there any other forms of numbers that are excluded?  \n  - Based on our analysis, only \\( 4k + 2 \\) numbers are excluded.\n\n**Reflection:** The approach seems solid. We've identified that only numbers of the form \\( 4k + 2 \\) cannot be expressed as the difference of squares, and we've counted them accurately.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Number of Integers Between 1 and 1000 That Can Be Expressed as the Difference of the Squares of Two Nonnegative Integers:**\n\n\\[\\boxed{750}\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Wrapping Up: Final Thoughts and Verification**\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Did We Consider All Cases?**  \n  - Yes, we've analyzed the parity of the factors in the difference of squares and identified the specific form of numbers that cannot be expressed this way.\n\n- **Is There Any Possibility of Overlooking Numbers?**  \n  - No, because the condition \\( m \\times k = n \\) with \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) having the same parity covers all possible cases.\n\n- **Does the Calculation Hold?**  \n  - Yes, subtracting the \\( 250 \\) numbers of the form \\( 4k + 2 \\) from the total \\( 1000 \\) gives us \\( 750 \\), which aligns with our theoretical understanding.\n\n**Verification with Examples:**\n\n- **n = 4 (4 \u00d7 1):**  \n  \\[2^2 - 0^2 = 4\\] \u2192 Can be expressed.\n\n- **n = 5 (4 \u00d7 1 + 1):**  \n  \\[3^2 - 2^2 = 9 - 4 = 5\\] \u2192 Can be expressed.\n\n- **n = 6 (4 \u00d7 1 + 2):**  \n  As checked earlier, cannot be expressed.\n\n- **n = 8 (4 \u00d7 2):**  \n  \\[3^2 - 1^2 = 9 - 1 = 8\\] \u2192 Can be expressed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The approach is correct, and the final answer is consistent with both the theoretical analysis and example verification.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\\boxed{750}\\]",
