  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll approach it just like I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work frequently, and being open to changing directions if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we have an equation involving numbers expressed in base \\( p \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number:\n\n\\[\n1007_p + 306_p + 113_p + 125_p + 6_p = 142_p + 271_p + 360_p\n\\]\n\nWe need to find how many possible values of \\( p \\) exist that satisfy this equation.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- This looks like a problem involving different bases. Each number is expressed in base \\( p \\).\n- Maybe converting these numbers from base \\( p \\) to base 10 would help.\n- I recall problems where converting to base 10 makes it easier to handle equations like this.\n\nBut wait, converting all these numbers might be tedious. Is there a better way?\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n1. **Convert All Numbers to Base 10:** Calculate each number in base 10 and see if the equation holds for different primes \\( p \\).\n2. **Simplify the Equation:** Maybe simplifying both sides before converting could reduce the workload.\n3. **Look for Patterns or Constraints on \\( p \\):** Perhaps identifying constraints on \\( p \\) could narrow down the possible primes without exhaustive checking.\n\nI'll start by attempting to convert to base 10, but if it gets too cumbersome, I'll consider simplifying the equation first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Converting Numbers to Base 10**\n\nLet's attempt to convert each number from base \\( p \\) to base 10.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- A number like \\( 1007_p \\) means \\( 1 \\times p^3 + 0 \\times p^2 + 0 \\times p + 7 \\).\n- I'll apply this conversion to each number.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n#### **Left Side (LS):**\n\n1. **\\( 1007_p \\):**\n   \\[\n   1 \\times p^3 + 0 \\times p^2 + 0 \\times p + 7 = p^3 + 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **\\( 306_p \\):**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times p^2 + 0 \\times p + 6 = 3p^2 + 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **\\( 113_p \\):**\n   \\[\n   1 \\times p^2 + 1 \\times p + 3 = p^2 + p + 3\n   \\]\n\n4. **\\( 125_p \\):**\n   \\[\n   1 \\times p^2 + 2 \\times p + 5 = p^2 + 2p + 5\n   \\]\n\n5. **\\( 6_p \\):**\n   \\[\n   6 = 6\n   \\]\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LS} = (p^3 + 7) + (3p^2 + 6) + (p^2 + p + 3) + (p^2 + 2p + 5) + 6\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LS} = p^3 + 3p^2 + p^2 + p^2 + 2p + 7 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 6\n\\]\n\\[\n= p^3 + 5p^2 + 2p + 27\n\\]\n\nLet me double-check this:\n\n- \\( 3p^2 + p^2 + p^2 = 5p^2 \\)\n- Constants: \\( 7 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 27 \\)\n\nLooks correct.\n\n#### **Right Side (RS):**\n\n1. **\\( 142_p \\):**\n   \\[\n   1 \\times p^2 + 4 \\times p + 2 = p^2 + 4p + 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **\\( 271_p \\):**\n   \\[\n   2 \\times p^2 + 7 \\times p + 1 = 2p^2 + 7p + 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **\\( 360_p \\):**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times p^2 + 6 \\times p + 0 = 3p^2 + 6p\n   \\]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{RS} = (p^2 + 4p + 2) + (2p^2 + 7p + 1) + (3p^2 + 6p)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\text{RS} = p^2 + 2p^2 + 3p^2 + 4p + 7p + 6p + 2 + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 6p^2 + 17p + 3\n\\]\n\nDouble-checking:\n\n- \\( p^2 + 2p^2 + 3p^2 = 6p^2 \\)\n- \\( 4p + 7p + 6p = 17p \\)\n- Constants: \\( 2 + 1 = 3 \\)\n\nEverything seems correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\nConverting to base 10 wasn't too bad. Now, let's set up the equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation**\n\nNow we have:\n\n\\[\np^3 + 5p^2 + 2p + 27 = 6p^2 + 17p + 3\n\\]\n\n**Next Thought:**\nI need to solve for \\( p \\), but since \\( p \\) is a prime, I should look for integer solutions that are prime numbers.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Rearrange the equation to set it to zero.\n- Factor the resulting polynomial if possible.\n- Check which prime numbers satisfy the equation.\n\nAlright, let's proceed with rearranging the equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Rearranging the Equation**\n\nSubtract the right side from both sides:\n\n\\[\np^3 + 5p^2 + 2p + 27 - 6p^2 - 17p - 3 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\np^3 + (5p^2 - 6p^2) + (2p - 17p) + (27 - 3) = 0\n\\]\n\\[\np^3 - p^2 - 15p + 24 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nLooks good so far. Now, I have a cubic equation:\n\n\\[\np^3 - p^2 - 15p + 24 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Next Thought:**\nI need to find the prime values of \\( p \\) that satisfy this equation. Factoring the polynomial or using the Rational Root Theorem might help.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Factoring the Polynomial:** Attempt to factor the cubic equation.\n- **Testing Prime Numbers:** Substitute small prime numbers to see if they satisfy the equation.\n- **Using Polynomial Division:** If a prime root is found, use it to factor the polynomial further.\n\nI'll start by testing small prime numbers since \\( p \\) must be a prime.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Testing Small Prime Numbers**\n\nLet's test \\( p = 2, 3, 5, \\) and \\( 7 \\) to see if they satisfy the equation.\n\n#### **a. \\( p = 2 \\):**\n\n\\[\n2^3 - 2^2 - 15 \\times 2 + 24 = 8 - 4 - 30 + 24 = -2\n\\]\n\n\\(-2 \\neq 0\\), so \\( p = 2 \\) **is not** a solution.\n\n#### **b. \\( p = 3 \\):**\n\n\\[\n3^3 - 3^2 - 15 \\times 3 + 24 = 27 - 9 - 45 + 24 = -3\n\\]\n\n\\(-3 \\neq 0\\), so \\( p = 3 \\) **is not** a solution.\n\n#### **c. \\( p = 5 \\):**\n\n\\[\n5^3 - 5^2 - 15 \\times 5 + 24 = 125 - 25 - 75 + 24 = 49\n\\]\n\n\\(49 \\neq 0\\), so \\( p = 5 \\) **is not** a solution.\n\n#### **d. \\( p = 7 \\):**\n\n\\[\n7^3 - 7^2 - 15 \\times 7 + 24 = 343 - 49 - 105 + 24 = 213\n\\]\n\n\\(213 \\neq 0\\), so \\( p = 7 \\) **is not** a solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\nNone of the small prime numbers worked. Maybe I need to test larger primes or reconsider my approach.\n\n**Next Thought:**\nPerhaps there's a prime greater than 7 that satisfies the equation, or maybe there's a mistake in my initial setup. But since the coefficients are relatively small, it's unlikely that larger primes would satisfy the equation.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Check for Higher Primes:** Test \\( p = 11 \\) and \\( p = 13 \\) just to be sure.\n- **Re-examine the Equation:** Make sure there are no errors in the conversion or setup.\n\nI'll proceed by testing \\( p = 11 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Testing \\( p = 11 \\)**\n\n\\[\n11^3 - 11^2 - 15 \\times 11 + 24 = 1331 - 121 - 165 + 24 = 1069\n\\]\n\n\\(1069 \\neq 0\\), so \\( p = 11 \\) **is not** a solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\nGiven that even \\( p = 11 \\) doesn't work, and the coefficients of the polynomial are relatively small, it's unlikely that any prime \\( p > 11 \\) would satisfy the equation.\n\n**Next Thought:**\nPerhaps there's an error in my approach, or maybe I need to look at the equation differently.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Re-examine the Conversion:** Ensure that I converted the numbers correctly from base \\( p \\) to base 10.\n- **Consider Alternative Strategies:** Maybe simplifying the original equation before converting could help.\n\nWait a minute, what if I try simplifying the equation before converting everything to base 10? That might reveal something I missed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Simplifying the Original Equation**\n\nLet's go back to the original equation:\n\n\\[\n1007_p + 306_p + 113_p + 125_p + 6_p = 142_p + 271_p + 360_p\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Perhaps grouping similar terms or simplifying both sides before converting could make things easier.\n- Alternatively, noticing that some numbers might cancel out could simplify the equation.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Simplify Both Sides:** Add up the numbers on each side in base \\( p \\) before converting.\n- **Look for Symmetry:** Maybe there's symmetry in the equation that can be exploited.\n\nLet's try adding up the numbers on each side in base \\( p \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Adding Numbers in Base \\( p \\)**\n\n**Left Side (LS):**\n\n\\[\n1007_p + 306_p + 113_p + 125_p + 6_p\n\\]\n\nI can attempt to add these numbers directly in base \\( p \\):\n\n1. Start by adding \\( 1007_p + 306_p \\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{c}\n     & 1\\ 0\\ 0\\ 7 \\\\\n   + & \\ \\ \\ \\ 3\\ 0\\ 6 \\\\\n   \\hline\n   = & 1\\ 3\\ 0\\ 13 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n   But in base \\( p \\), \\( 13 \\) needs to be reduced if \\( p \\leq 13 \\).\n\n   Let's assume \\( p \\geq 13 \\) for now; otherwise, we'd carry over.\n\n2. Next, add \\( 113_p \\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{c}\n     & 1\\ 3\\ 0\\ 13 \\\\\n   + & \\ \\ \\ \\ 1\\ 1\\ 3 \\\\\n   \\hline\n   = & 1\\ 4\\ 2\\ 16 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n   Again, if \\( p \\leq 16 \\), we'd need to carry over.\n\n3. Add \\( 125_p \\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{c}\n     & 1\\ 4\\ 2\\ 16 \\\\\n   + & \\ \\ \\ \\ 1\\ 2\\ 5 \\\\\n   \\hline\n   = & 1\\ 5\\ 4\\ 21 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n   More carrying needed if \\( p \\leq 21 \\).\n\n4. Finally, add \\( 6_p \\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{c}\n     & 1\\ 5\\ 4\\ 21 \\\\\n   + & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 6 \\\\\n   \\hline\n   = & 1\\ 5\\ 4\\ 27 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n   Carry over if \\( p \\leq 27 \\).\n\nBut this process is getting messy. Maybe converting to base 10 was the better approach after all.\n\n**Reflection:**\nAttempting to add directly in base \\( p \\) is complicated by the need to carry over digits when \\( p \\) is smaller than some of the numbers involved. Perhaps continuing with the base 10 approach is more straightforward.\n\n**Next Thought:**\nSince adding directly in base \\( p \\) is cumbersome, I'll stick with the base 10 conversion and look for factoring the polynomial.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Factoring the Polynomial**\n\nRecall the equation:\n\n\\[\np^3 - p^2 - 15p + 24 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Factoring cubic polynomials can be challenging, but if \\( p \\) is prime, we can look for integer roots.\n- The Rational Root Theorem suggests that possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (24).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- List the factors of 24: \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 6, \\pm 8, \\pm 12, \\pm 24 \\).\n- Test the positive prime factors: \\( 2, 3, 5, 7, \\) etc.\n\nBut since we've already tested \\( p = 2, 3, 5, 7, \\) and \\( 11 \\) and found that none of them work, it's unlikely that higher primes will satisfy the equation.\n\n**Reflection:**\nGiven that none of the small primes worked and the coefficients of the polynomial are relatively small, it's reasonable to conclude that there may be no prime \\( p \\) that satisfies the equation.\n\n**Next Thought:**\nPerhaps there's a constraint on \\( p \\) that I'm missing, or maybe the equation has no prime solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Considering Constraints on \\( p \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Maybe the equation imposes certain constraints on \\( p \\).\n- For example, if \\( p \\) needs to be greater than a certain value for the equation to hold, or perhaps \\( p \\) must satisfy specific divisibility conditions.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Look for patterns in the equation that might hint at constraints on \\( p \\).\n- Consider whether \\( p \\) needs to be greater than the largest digit in the base \\( p \\) numbers.\n\nWait, actually, since we're dealing with base \\( p \\) representations, \\( p \\) must be greater than the largest digit used. Looking at the original equation:\n\n- The largest digit is 7 (in \\( 1007_p \\)).\n\nTherefore, \\( p \\) must be greater than 7.\n\n**Next Thought:**\nThis means we only need to consider prime numbers greater than 7. Let's re-evaluate our approach with this constraint in mind.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Re-evaluating the Approach with \\( p > 7 \\)**\n\nGiven that \\( p > 7 \\), let's reconsider the polynomial:\n\n\\[\np^3 - p^2 - 15p + 24 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since \\( p \\) must be greater than 7, we should test primes greater than 7.\n- However, testing larger primes manually is impractical, so perhaps factoring the polynomial or using synthetic division could help.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Factoring the Polynomial:** Attempt to factor the cubic equation to see if any larger primes satisfy it.\n- **Using Synthetic Division:** If a root is found, use it to simplify the polynomial and find other roots.\n\nBut since testing \\( p = 11 \\) already yielded no solution, and higher primes would make the left side much larger than the right side, it's likely that no prime \\( p > 7 \\) satisfies the equation.\n\n**Reflection:**\nIt's becoming apparent that there may be no prime \\( p \\) that satisfies the equation. However, to be thorough, let's attempt to factor the polynomial.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 11: Attempting to Factor the Polynomial**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\np^3 - p^2 - 15p + 24 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Factoring a cubic polynomial can be challenging, but perhaps recognizing patterns or using known factoring techniques can help.\n- Alternatively, using the Rational Root Theorem to test potential roots could lead to a factor.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Look for factoring by grouping.\n- Check if the polynomial can be factored into linear and quadratic terms.\n\nLet's attempt factoring by grouping:\n\n\\[\np^3 - p^2 - 15p + 24 = 0\n\\]\n\nGroup terms:\n\n\\[\n(p^3 - p^2) + (-15p + 24) = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor out common factors:\n\n\\[\np^2(p - 1) - 15(p - \\frac{24}{15}) = 0\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't simplify nicely. Maybe factoring by grouping isn't the right approach here.\n\n**Reflection:**\nFactoring by grouping doesn't seem to work. Perhaps I need to look for another factoring method or consider that the polynomial may not have integer roots.\n\n**Next Thought:**\nSince factoring by grouping failed, and testing small primes didn't yield any solutions, it's possible that the polynomial doesn't have prime roots. However, to be certain, let's explore other factoring techniques or consider that there may be no prime solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 12: Exploring Other Factoring Techniques or Concluding No Solutions**\n\nGiven the difficulty in factoring the polynomial and the negative results from testing small primes, it's reasonable to conclude that there may be no prime \\( p \\) that satisfies the equation.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- If no small primes satisfy the equation and factoring doesn't reveal any prime roots, it's likely that no such prime \\( p \\) exists.\n- However, to be thorough, ensuring that the polynomial doesn't have any prime roots is essential.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Consider using synthetic division with potential prime factors.\n- Accept that the polynomial may not have prime solutions and conclude accordingly.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nAfter testing small primes and attempting to factor the polynomial without success, it's reasonable to conclude that there are no prime values of \\( p \\) that satisfy the given equation.\n\n**Final Check:**\nSince all tested primes (\\( p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 \\)) do not satisfy the equation and factoring attempts did not yield any prime roots, it's safe to conclude that no such prime \\( p \\) exists.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER> **Zero (0):** There are no prime values of \\( p \\) that satisfy the given equation. </ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- Initially, converting the numbers to base 10 seemed like a straightforward approach, but testing small primes revealed that none satisfied the equation.\n- Attempting to factor the polynomial didn't yield any prime roots, leading to the conclusion that no such prime \\( p \\) exists.\n- Throughout the process, frequent checks and reflections ensured that no potential solutions were overlooked.\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n- Testing small prime numbers is a quick way to identify potential solutions, but it's essential to verify through factoring or other methods to ensure completeness.\n- Factoring cubic polynomials can be challenging, and sometimes, no integer (or prime) roots exist, necessitating alternative strategies or acceptance of no solutions.\n- Being open to revisiting and adjusting strategies is crucial in problem-solving, especially when initial approaches don't yield results.\n\n---\n\n**Complete Solution:**\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n- We have an equation involving numbers expressed in base \\( p \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number.\n- Our goal is to find all possible prime values of \\( p \\) that satisfy the equation.\n\n**Initial Strategy:**\n1. **Convert Numbers to Base 10:** \n   -
