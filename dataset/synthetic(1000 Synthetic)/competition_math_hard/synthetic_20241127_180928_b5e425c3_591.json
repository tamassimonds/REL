  "solution": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem as if I were solving it step by step, thinking aloud, and checking my work along the way. Here's the question:\n\n---\n\n**Question:**\n\nFor what values of \\( j \\) does the equation \\((2x+7)(x-5) = -43 + jx\\) have exactly one real solution? Express your answer as a list of numbers, separated by commas.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, okay. This looks like a quadratic equation because we have products of linear terms on the left side. The right side includes \\(-43 + jx\\), so \\( j \\) is a parameter we need to determine. Our goal is to find the values of \\( j \\) that make the equation have exactly one real solution.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Expand the Left Side:** Maybe expanding \\((2x + 7)(x - 5)\\) will help reveal the quadratic form.\n\n2. **Set as Quadratic Equation:** Once expanded, I can compare both sides and see how \\( j \\) affects the coefficients.\n\n3. **Use the Discriminant:** I remember that for a quadratic equation to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant (\\(\\Delta\\)) must be zero.\n\n4. **Alternative Methods:** Completing the square or using vertex form could provide insights, but that might complicate things.\n\nI think I'll start by **expanding the left side** to see what the quadratic equation looks like.\n\n### **Step 1: Expanding the Left Side**\n\nLet\u2019s expand \\((2x + 7)(x - 5)\\):\n\n\\[\n(2x + 7)(x - 5) = 2x(x) + 2x(-5) + 7(x) + 7(-5)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 2x^2 - 10x + 7x - 35\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 2x^2 - 3x - 35\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, that worked out nicely. Now the equation looks like:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 3x - 35 = -43 + jx\n\\]\n\n### **Step 2: Bringing Everything to One Side**\n\nI think it makes sense to bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero. Let's move \\(-43 + jx\\) to the left side:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 3x - 35 - (-43 + jx) = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 3x - 35 + 43 - jx = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - (3 + j)x + 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me double-check that calculation:\n\n\\(-35 + 43 = 8\\), and \\(-3x - jx = -(3 + j)x\\). Yup, looks correct.\n\n**Current Equation:**\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - (3 + j)x + 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### **Step 3: Using the Discriminant**\n\nGiven a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant is \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\). For the equation to have exactly one real solution, \\(\\Delta\\) must be zero.\n\nLet\u2019s apply this here:\n\n\\[\na = 2, \\quad b = -(3 + j), \\quad c = 8\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = [-(3 + j)]^2 - 4(2)(8)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (3 + j)^2 - 64\n\\]\n\n**Set the Discriminant to Zero:**\n\n\\[\n(3 + j)^2 - 64 = 0\n\\]\n\n### **Step 4: Solving for \\( j \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s solve this equation step by step:\n\n\\[\n(3 + j)^2 = 64\n\\]\n\n**Thinking:**\n\nWait, when I take the square root, I should remember that there are both positive and negative roots. So, \\(3 + j\\) could be either \\(8\\) or \\(-8\\).\n\n\\[\n3 + j = 8 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 3 + j = -8\n\\]\n\nSolving these:\n\n1. \\(3 + j = 8\\)\n   \\[\n   j = 8 - 3 = 5\n   \\]\n   \n2. \\(3 + j = -8\\)\n   \\[\n   j = -8 - 3 = -11\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, I found \\( j = 5 \\) and \\( j = -11 \\). But let's take a moment to think\u2014do these values make sense?\n\nWhen \\( j = 5 \\) or \\( j = -11 \\), the discriminant is zero, meaning the quadratic has exactly one real solution (a repeated root).\n\n### **Step 5: Quick Verification**\n\nLet\u2019s plug \\( j = 5 \\) back into the equation to see if it works.\n\nOriginal equation with \\( j = 5 \\):\n\n\\[\n(2x + 7)(x - 5) = -43 + 5x\n\\]\n\nWe already expanded the left side:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 3x - 35 = -43 + 5x\n\\]\n\nBringing everything to one side:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 3x - 35 + 43 - 5x = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 8x + 8 = 0\n\\]\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-8)^2 - 4(2)(8) = 64 - 64 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nYup, the discriminant is zero, so it checks out.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter walking through the problem step by step and verifying our solution, the values of \\( j \\) that make the equation have exactly one real solution are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5, -11}\n\\]\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Started by Expanding:** We expanded the left side to get a clear quadratic equation.\n- **Set Equation to Zero:** Moved all terms to one side to form \\(2x^2 - (3 + j)x + 8 = 0\\).\n- **Applied Discriminant:** Used the condition \\(\\Delta = 0\\) for exactly one real solution.\n- **Solved for \\( j \\):** Found \\( j = 5 \\) and \\( j = -11 \\).\n- **Verified Solution:** Plugged back into the original equation to ensure the discriminant is zero, confirming the correctness.\n\nThroughout the process, frequent checks helped ensure each step was correct, leading to a reliable final answer.\n\n---\n\nAnd there we have it! By carefully expanding, setting the equation to zero, applying the discriminant condition, and verifying our solutions, we confidently arrived at the correct values of \\( j \\).",
  "ground_truth": "We begin by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation and subtracting $-43+jx$ from both sides. We get $2x^2+(-3-j)x+8=0$. For this quadratic to have exactly one real root, the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ must be equal to $0$. Thus, we require $(-3-j)^2-4(2)(8) = 0$. Solving, we get that $j=\\boxed{5,\\,-11}$."
