  "problem": "Bob rolls a fair six-sided die each morning. If Bob rolls a composite number, he eats sweetened cereal. If he rolls a prime number, he eats unsweetened cereal. If he rolls a 1, then he rolls again. In a non-leap year, what is the expected number of times Bob will roll his die?",
  "solution": "---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this question about Bob and his daily die rolls. At first glance, it seems straightforward\u2014rolling a die each morning and making decisions based on the outcome. But wait, the question asks for the **expected number of times** Bob will roll the die in a year. Hmm, that suggests this is about probability and expectations. \n\nInitially, I'm thinking about:\n\n- **Understanding the die outcomes:** Which numbers are composite, prime, or require a re-roll?\n- **Calculating probabilities:** Determining the likelihood of each outcome requiring a re-roll.\n- **Expected rolls per day:** Figuring out how many rolls Bob needs on average each day.\n  \nThis reminds me of problems involving **expected values** where certain outcomes lead to repeating an action until a condition is met. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to connect all these ideas yet. Let's brainstorm different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **List Possible Outcomes:**  \n   Maybe I can list all the die outcomes and see which require re-rolls.\n\n2. **Calculate Probabilities:**  \n   Find the probability of needing to roll again and use that to determine the expected number of rolls per day.\n\n3. **Use Expected Value Formula:**  \n   Perhaps applying the expected value formula for repeated trials could work.\n\n4. **Simulation Approach:**  \n   Running a simulation to approximate the number of rolls could be helpful, but it's not practical for an exact answer.\n\n**Wait,** listing all outcomes might be a good starting point to get a clear picture. Let's try that first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Listing Die Outcomes**\n\nBob rolls a **fair six-sided die** (1 through 6) each morning. Let's categorize each outcome:\n\n- **Composite Numbers:** 4, 6\n- **Prime Numbers:** 2, 3, 5\n- **Re-roll:** 1\n\nSo, if Bob rolls a **1**, he needs to roll again. This means that not all rolls result in a decision about cereal; some rolls lead to additional rolls. \n\n**Reflection:**  \nListing the outcomes helps me see that only rolling a **1** triggers a re-roll. So, understanding how often Bob rolls a **1** is key to determining the total number of rolls.\n\n**Thought:**  \nMaybe I can calculate the probability of rolling a **1** and use that to find the expected number of rolls per day. But wait, does this account for multiple re-rolls in a single day? I need to think this through.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Probability of Re-rolling**\n\nLet's find the probability of each outcome:\n\n- Probability of rolling a **1:** \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n- Probability of rolling a **composite or prime number (no re-roll):** \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\) (since 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 do not require re-rolling)\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI see that each roll has a \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) chance of requiring a re-roll. But how does this probability affect the expected number of rolls per day? \n\n**Possible Approach:**  \nI remember from probability theory that if there's a probability of needing to repeat an action, we can use the concept of **geometric series** to find the expected number of attempts. Let's explore that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying Expected Value Concepts**\n\nThe expected number of rolls per day can be thought of as:\n\n\\[ E[\\text{Rolls per Day}] = 1 + (\\text{Probability of Re-roll}) \\times E[\\text{Rolls per Day}] \\]\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- **First roll:** Always happens, so add 1.\n- **Re-rolls:** Only occur if a 1 is rolled, which happens with probability \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ E = 1 + \\frac{1}{6} \\times E \\]\n\n**Solving for \\( E \\):**\n\nWait a minute, this looks like a straightforward algebra problem. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for \\( E \\).\n\n\\[ E - \\frac{1}{6}E = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{6}E = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis result suggests that on average, Bob needs **1.2 rolls per day**. It makes sense because if there's a 1 in 6 chance of needing a re-roll, the average number of rolls per day would be slightly more than 1.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nCalculating \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1.2 = 0.2 \\). Adding this to the initial roll gives 1.2, which aligns with our expectation. This seems correct!\n\n**Thought:**  \nOkay, I think this approach works. Now, I can use this expected number of rolls per day to find the total expected rolls in a non-leap year.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating Total Rolls in a Non-Leap Year**\n\nA non-leap year has **365 days**. \n\nSo, the total expected number of rolls is:\n\n\\[ 365 \\times 1.2 = 438 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nMultiplying the expected rolls per day by the number of days gives us the total expected rolls in the year. This straightforward calculation seems correct.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n365 days with an average of 1.2 rolls per day would indeed result in 438 total rolls. No inconsistencies here.\n\n**Thought:**  \nThis final answer feels right, but let's consider if there's another way to verify it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution with an Alternate Approach**\n\nJust to be sure, let's think of another way to approach this problem. Maybe calculating the expected number of rolls using a different method can confirm our answer.\n\n**Alternate Approach: Using Geometric Series**\n\nSince rolling a **1** requires a re-roll, we can model the number of rolls as a geometric series where each roll has a \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\) chance of ending the sequence (rolling a composite or prime number).\n\nThe expected number of rolls per day is the sum of this series:\n\n\\[ E = 1 + \\frac{1}{6} + \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 + \\ldots \\]\n\nThis series sums up to:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{6}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{6}} = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nUsing the geometric series approach also yields **1.2 rolls per day**, which matches our previous calculation. This consistency strengthens the validity of our solution.\n\n**Thought:**  \nHaving two different methods agree on the same result gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nIn a non-leap year, Bob is expected to roll his die **438 times**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the solution with an alternate approach, we arrived at the correct answer. Bob is expected to roll the die **438 times** in a non-leap year.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Understanding the Problem:** Determine the expected number of die rolls per day due to re-rolls.\n- **Calculating Expected Rolls per Day:** Using probability and expected value concepts, found that Bob rolls the die 1.2 times per day on average.\n- **Total Rolls in a Year:** Multiplying by 365 days gives a total of 438 rolls.\n- **Verification:** An alternate approach using geometric series confirmed the calculation.\n- **Final Answer:** Bob rolls the die **438 times** in a non-leap year.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The use of reflections and multiple strategies ensures a thorough understanding and correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Post-Answer Reflection:**\n\nAfter arriving at the final answer, it's always good to take a moment to reflect and ensure everything makes sense.\n\n- **Does the Answer Seem Reasonable?**  \n  Given that only rolling a 1 requires a re-roll, and this happens with a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\), an average of 1.2 rolls per day seems logical. Multiplying by 365 days to get 438 total rolls aligns with expectations.\n\n- **Alternative Validation:**  \n  Both the initial expected value approach and the geometric series method agree, providing confidence in the correctness of the answer.\n\n- **Potential Errors:**  \n  No apparent errors were identified during the process. Each step logically follows from the previous one, and intermediate checks support the final outcome.\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nBy carefully exploring different strategies, checking calculations along the way, and verifying the solution through multiple methods, we've ensured the accuracy of the final answer. Bob is expected to roll the die **438 times** in a non-leap year.",
  "ground_truth": "Let the expected value of the number of times Bob rolls his die on a single day be $E$. When Bob rolls his die, there is a $\\frac{5}{6}$ chance that he will stop rolling after one roll, and a $\\frac{1}{6}$ chance that he will have to start over. In the second case, since his first roll had no effect on the outcome, Bob will on average roll his die $E$ more times, for a total of $1+E$ times that day. Therefore, we know that $E=\\frac{5}{6}(1)+\\frac{1}{6}(1+E)$, or that $E=\\frac{6}{5}$. Over 365 days, Bob will roll his die an average of $\\frac{6}{5}\\cdot365=\\boxed{438}$ times total."
