  "solution": "### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process just like I'd tackle it on paper, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the intersection point of the graphs \\( y = h(x) \\) and \\( y = h(x-3) \\), and then determine the sum of the coordinates of that point.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Transformations Insight:** Replacing \\( x \\) with \\( x-3 \\) shifts the graph horizontally to the right by 3 units.\n  \n- **Intersection Points:** At the intersection, both functions have the same value: \\( h(x) = h(x-3) \\).\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Algebraic Approach:** Set \\( h(x) = h(x-3) \\) and solve for \\( x \\).\n  2. **Graphical Interpretation:** Visualize how the graphs overlap.\n  3. **Symmetry Considerations:** Utilize the function's symmetry.\n\nI'm leaning towards starting with the **algebraic approach** since it seems straightforward. But I'll keep other strategies in mind in case I need them.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation**\n\nLet's set the two functions equal at the point of intersection:\n\n\\[\nh(x) = h(x-3)\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This equation suggests that the function's value repeats or mirrors every 3 units.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Does this make sense? Yes, if there's only one intersection point, this equation should help us find it.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n- Since we don't have the explicit form of \\( h(x) \\), let's think about what kind of functions behave this way.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Function**\n\nThe given graph equation is:\n\n\\[\ny = 4.125 - \\frac{(x + 0.5)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This is a parabola in the form \\( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \\), with:\n  - Vertex at \\( x = -0.5 \\)\n  - Opens downwards (since the coefficient is negative)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Knowing the vertex and direction helps in understanding the parabola's symmetry.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n- Let's use this information to solve \\( h(x) = h(x-3) \\) algebraically.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Equation Algebraically**\n\nSet up the equation:\n\n\\[\n4.125 - \\frac{(x + 0.5)^2}{2} = 4.125 - \\frac{((x-3) + 0.5)^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n1. **Cancel Out Constants:**\n\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{(x + 0.5)^2}{2} = -\\frac{(x - 2.5)^2}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Multiply Both Sides by -2:**\n\n   \\[\n   (x + 0.5)^2 = (x - 2.5)^2\n   \\]\n   \n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Expanding both sides:\n\n  \\[\n  (x + 0.5)^2 = x^2 + 1x + 0.25\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  (x - 2.5)^2 = x^2 - 5x + 6.25\n  \\]\n  \n- Setting them equal:\n\n  \\[\n  x^2 + 1x + 0.25 = x^2 - 5x + 6.25\n  \\]\n  \n- Canceling out \\( x^2 \\):\n\n  \\[\n  1x + 0.25 = -5x + 6.25\n  \\]\n  \n- Rearranging:\n\n  \\[\n  6x = 6\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  x = 1\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** This gives \\( x = 1 \\). But the graph is symmetric around \\( x = -0.5 \\), and shifting by 3 units should lead to a different intersection point. Is this correct?\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n- Let's plug \\( x = 1 \\) back into the original function to find \\( y \\):\n\n  \\[\n  y = 4.125 - \\frac{(1 + 0.5)^2}{2} = 4.125 - \\frac{2.25}{2} = 4.125 - 1.125 = 3\n  \\]\n  \n- So, the intersection point is \\( (1, 3) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Does this make sense? Given the graph's symmetry and the transformation applied, the intersection at \\( x = 1 \\) seems plausible.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n- **Sum of Coordinates:**\n\n  \\[\n  1 + 3 = 4\n  \\]\n\n**But Wait:**\n\n- **User Insight:** The user mentioned that at \\( x = -1 \\), the function values are the same in both graphs, and the sum of the coordinates is \\( 1 \\).\n\n- **Re-evaluating:** Let's consider multiple intersection points due to the parabola's symmetry.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Multiple Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Quadratic Equations:** The equation \\( (x + 0.5)^2 = (x - 2.5)^2 \\) might have multiple solutions.\n\n- **Factoring Difference of Squares:** Let's try factoring the equation to see if there are multiple solutions.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n1. **Expanding Both Sides:**\n\n   \\[\n   x^2 + x + 0.25 = x^2 - 5x + 6.25\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Subtracting \\( x^2 \\) from Both Sides:**\n\n   \\[\n   x + 0.25 = -5x + 6.25\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Rearranging:**\n\n   \\[\n   6x = 6\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   x = 1\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** This only gives one solution. To find other possible solutions, consider that the squares being equal implies two cases:\n\n  1. \\( (x + 0.5) = (x - 2.5) \\)\n  2. \\( (x + 0.5) = -(x - 2.5) \\)\n  \n- **Considering Both Cases:**\n\n  - **Case 1:** Already solved, yielding \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n  - **Case 2:**\n    \n    \\[\n    x + 0.5 = -(x - 2.5)\n    \\]\n    \n    \\[\n    x + 0.5 = -x + 2.5\n    \\]\n    \n    \\[\n    2x = 2\n    \\]\n    \n    \\[\n    x = 1\n    \\]\n    \n    - **Interesting:** Both cases lead to the same solution, \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n- **Conclusion:** The algebraic approach confirms that the intersection point is \\( x = 1 \\), \\( y = 3 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Exploring Graphical and Symmetry Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Graph Shifting:** The graph of \\( y = h(x-3) \\) is the original graph shifted 3 units to the right.\n  \n- **Intersection Points:** The two graphs intersect where their function values are equal, meaning \\( h(x) = h(x-3) \\).\n\n- **Symmetry Consideration:** Given the parabola's symmetry around its vertex at \\( x = -0.5 \\), shifting the graph should create intersection points that are symmetric relative to the vertex.\n\n- **Possible Intersection Points:** Given the symmetry, the intersection points might be \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n**Checking at \\( x = -1 \\):**\n\n\\[\nh(-1) = h(-1 - 3) = h(-4)\n\\]\n\n- Plugging into the original function:\n\n  \\[\n  h(-1) = 4.125 - \\frac{((-1) + 0.5)^2}{2} = 4.125 - \\frac{0.25}{2} = 4.125 - 0.125 = 4\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  h(-4) = 4.125 - \\frac{((-4) + 0.5)^2}{2} = 4.125 - \\frac{12.25}{2} = 4.125 - 6.125 = -2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Wait:** This doesn't satisfy \\( h(-1) = h(-4) \\). There seems to be a mistake here.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Possible Mistake:** Perhaps the user's example was incorrect, or there was a misunderstanding. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Let's focus on the algebraic solution but also consider the symmetry to ensure completeness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Checking Consistency:** Both algebraic and graphical interpretations point to the intersection at \\( (1, 3) \\).\n\n- **Sum of Coordinates:** Therefore, the sum is \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **User Insight:** The user suggested that the sum of the coordinates is \\( 1 \\), which contradicts our findings. However, based on the detailed algebraic and graphical analysis, the correct sum is \\( 4 \\).\n\n- **Possible User Mistake:** The user might have misidentified the intersection point or made an arithmetic error.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Verification:** Plugging \\( x = 1 \\) back into both functions confirms that the intersection point is \\( (1, 3) \\).\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\n- **Summing Coordinates:** \n\n  \\[\n  1 + 3 = 4\n  \\]\n\n**<ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\n**</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies, including algebraic solutions and graphical interpretations, and reflecting on each step, we've determined that the intersection point of the two graphs is \\( (1, 3) \\). Consequently, the sum of the coordinates is \\( 4 \\).\n\nThroughout the process, frequent checks and reflections ensured the correctness of the approach, leading to a consistent and verified solution.",
  "ground_truth": "If the graphs intersect at $(a,b)$, then we have $$h(a) = h(a-3) \\qquad(= b).$$Thus, $(a,b)$ and $(a-3,b)$ are both on the original graph of $y=h(x)$. Looking for two points on the original graph which are separated by $3$ units horizontally, we find $(-2,3)$ and $(1,3)$. Thus $a-3=-2,$ $a=1,$ and $b=3;$ the graphs of $y=h(x)$ and $y=h(x-3)$ intersect at $(1,3),$ the sum of whose coordinates is $\\boxed{4}$."
