  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through it naturally just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I notice that it involves three real numbers \\( x, y, z \\) with given sums of their linear and quadratic expressions:\n\n\\[\nx + y + z = 4\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 6\n\\]\n\nI need to find the smallest and largest possible values of \\( x \\) and then compute \\( m + M \\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This reminds me of problems involving symmetry and leveraging known identities.\n- I might need to use algebraic identities or inequalities.\n- Perhaps expressing \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) in terms of \\( x \\) could help.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Express \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) in terms of \\( x \\):** This would reduce the number of variables.\n2. **Use algebraic identities:** Such as the square of sums.\n3. **Apply inequalities:** Maybe use Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-GM.\n4. **Consider vector interpretations:** Though less familiar, it might provide insights.\n\nI\u2019m not sure which method will work best, so I'll start exploring the first strategy and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expressing \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) in Terms of \\( x \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- If I can express \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) in terms of \\( x \\), I can reduce the problem to a single variable, making it easier to analyze.\n- From the first equation, I can solve for \\( y + z \\):  \n  \\[\n  y + z = 4 - x\n  \\]\n- This gives me a relation between \\( x \\) and the sum of \\( y \\) and \\( z \\).\n\n**Proceeding Forward:**\n- I\u2019ll use this to substitute into the second equation to find another relation involving \\( x \\).\n\n**Substitution:**\n- The second equation is:  \n  \\[\n  x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 6\n  \\]\n- I know that:  \n  \\[\n  (y + z)^2 = y^2 + z^2 + 2yz\n  \\]\n- So, I can express \\( y^2 + z^2 \\) as:  \n  \\[\n  y^2 + z^2 = (y + z)^2 - 2yz = (4 - x)^2 - 2yz\n  \\]\n- Substituting back into the second equation:  \n  \\[\n  x^2 + (4 - x)^2 - 2yz = 6\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This introduces the product \\( yz \\), which complicates things a bit.\n- Maybe I need another equation involving \\( yz \\) to proceed.\n\n**Realization:**\n- Wait, I only have two equations but three variables. I need another relation to connect them.\n- Perhaps I can find an expression for \\( yz \\) using known identities or constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding an Expression for \\( yz \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to relate \\( yz \\) to the given equations.\n- Recall that for three variables, the square of the sum is related to the sum of squares and products:\n  \\[\n  (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)\n  \\]\n- I can use this identity to find \\( xy + yz + zx \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Given:  \n  \\[\n  (x + y + z)^2 = 4^2 = 16\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 6\n  \\]  \n  Substitute:  \n  \\[\n  16 = 6 + 2(xy + yz + zx)\n  \\]  \n  Solving for \\( xy + yz + zx \\):  \n  \\[\n  xy + yz + zx = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n  \\]\n\n**Proceeding:**\n- Now I have:  \n  \\[\n  xy + yz + zx = 5\n  \\]\n- This gives me another equation to work with.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- But I still need to isolate \\( x \\) and find its extrema.\n- Maybe I can set up a quadratic equation in terms of \\( x \\) by expressing \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) in terms of \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up a Quadratic Equation for \\( x \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Assign \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and another variable.\n- Consider the symmetry and possibly use quadratic roots to represent \\( y \\) and \\( z \\).\n\n**Exploration:**\n- Let\u2019s assume \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) are roots of a quadratic equation. This approach leverages symmetry and can simplify the problem.\n\n**Setting Up:**\n- Suppose \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) are roots of the quadratic:\n  \\[\n  t^2 - pt + q = 0\n  \\]\n  Where:\n  - \\( p = y + z = 4 - x \\)\n  - \\( q = yz \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This can work if I find expressions for \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) in terms of \\( x \\).\n\n**Proceeding:**\n- I already know \\( p = 4 - x \\).\n- To find \\( q = yz \\), I can use the earlier equations.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- From the identity:\n  \\[\n  (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)\n  \\]\n  I have:\n  \\[\n  16 = 6 + 2(xy + yz + zx) \\Rightarrow xy + yz + zx = 5\n  \\]\n- I can write:\n  \\[\n  xy + yz + zx = x(y + z) + yz = x(4 - x) + yz = 4x - x^2 + yz = 5\n  \\]\n- Solving for \\( yz \\):\n  \\[\n  yz = 5 - 4x + x^2\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Now, I have \\( yz \\) expressed in terms of \\( x \\).\n- This allows me to set up the quadratic equation whose roots are \\( y \\) and \\( z \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Analyzing the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- With \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) as roots of the quadratic equation, I can analyze the discriminant to ensure real solutions exist.\n- The discriminant must be non-negative for real roots.\n\n**Setting Up the Quadratic:**\n- The quadratic equation is:\n  \\[\n  t^2 - pt + q = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t^2 - (4 - x)t + (5 - 4x + x^2) = 0\n  \\]\n- Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  t^2 - (4 - x)t + (5 - 4x + x^2) = 0\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- To ensure \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) are real, the discriminant (\\( \\Delta \\)) of this quadratic must be non-negative:\n  \\[\n  \\Delta = (4 - x)^2 - 4(5 - 4x + x^2)\n  \\]\n- Simplifying the discriminant will help me find the range of possible \\( x \\) values.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Expanding the discriminant:\n  \\[\n  \\Delta = (4 - x)^2 - 4(5 - 4x + x^2)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = (16 - 8x + x^2) - (20 - 16x + 4x^2)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 16 - 8x + x^2 - 20 + 16x - 4x^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = -4 + 8x - 3x^2\n  \\]\n- So, the discriminant is:\n  \\[\n  \\Delta = -4 + 8x - 3x^2\n  \\]\n\n**Proceeding:**\n- For real solutions, \\( \\Delta \\geq 0 \\):\n  \\[\n  -4 + 8x - 3x^2 \\geq 0\n  \\]\n- I need to solve this inequality to find the range of \\( x \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Solving quadratic inequalities can be tricky, so I'll carefully factor or use the quadratic formula to find the critical points and then determine where the inequality holds.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the Inequality \\( -4 + 8x - 3x^2 \\geq 0 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- This is a quadratic inequality. I'll start by finding the roots of the corresponding equation:\n  \\[\n  -4 + 8x - 3x^2 = 0\n  \\]\n- Once I have the roots, I can determine the intervals where the inequality holds by analyzing the sign of the quadratic.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Rearranging the equation:\n  \\[\n  3x^2 - 8x + 4 = 0\n  \\]\n- Using the quadratic formula:\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 48}}{6} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{6}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{8 \\pm 4}{6}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{12}{6} = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n  \\]\n- So, the roots are:\n  \\[\n  x = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{2}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Proceeding:**\n- The quadratic opens upwards (since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive), so the inequality \\( -4 + 8x - 3x^2 \\geq 0 \\) holds between the roots:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2}{3} \\leq x \\leq 2\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This tells me that the possible values of \\( x \\) are within this range.\n- Therefore, the smallest value \\( m \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) and the largest value \\( M \\) is \\( 2 \\).\n- Now, I can compute \\( m + M \\):\n  \\[\n  m + M = \\frac{2}{3} + 2 = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{6}{3} = \\frac{8}{3}\n  \\]\n  \n**Wait a Moment:**\n- Let me double-check this. Does \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = \\frac{2}{3} \\) satisfy the original equations?\n- It's always good to verify the solution by substituting back into the original conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I'll substitute \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = \\frac{2}{3} \\) back into the original equations to ensure they satisfy both conditions.\n- This will confirm whether \\( m \\) and \\( M \\) are correct.\n\n**Case 1: \\( x = 2 \\)**\n- Given:\n  \\[\n  x + y + z = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2 + y + z = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y + z = 2\n  \\]\n- Second equation:\n  \\[\n  x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4 + y^2 + z^2 = 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y^2 + z^2 = 2\n  \\]\n- Do these values allow for real \\( y \\) and \\( z \\)?\n  - Yes, because \\( (y + z)^2 = 4 \\) and \\( y^2 + z^2 = 2 \\), which is consistent.\n\n**Case 2: \\( x = \\frac{2}{3} \\)**\n- Given:\n  \\[\n  x + y + z = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{2}{3} + y + z = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y + z = \\frac{10}{3}\n  \\]\n- Second equation:\n  \\[\n  x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{4}{9} + y^2 + z^2 = 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y^2 + z^2 = \\frac{50}{9}\n  \\]\n- Do these values allow for real \\( y \\) and \\( z \\)?\n  - Yes, because \\( (y + z)^2 = \\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{100}{9} \\) and \\( y^2 + z^2 = \\frac{50}{9} \\), which is consistent since:\n    \\[\n    (y + z)^2 = y^2 + z^2 + 2yz \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{100}{9} = \\frac{50}{9} + 2yz \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2yz = \\frac{50}{9} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad yz = \\frac{25}{9}\n    \\]\n  - This is a valid real number, so real \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) exist.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Both cases satisfy the original equations, confirming that the smallest and largest possible values of \\( x \\) are indeed \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) and \\( 2 \\), respectively.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\nm + M = \\frac{2}{3} + 2 = \\frac{8}{3}\n\\]\n  \n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** I started by considering different strategies, including expressing variables in terms of each other and using algebraic identities.\n- **Exploration:** Attempted to express \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) in terms of \\( x \\), which led to setting up a quadratic equation.\n- **Reflection:** Recognized the need to ensure real solutions by analyzing the discriminant of the quadratic.\n- **Solving:** Solved the inequality to find the range of \\( x \\).\n- **Verification:** Substituted the extreme values back into the original equations to confirm their validity.\n- **Conclusion:** Successfully determined \\( m + M = \\frac{8}{3} \\).\n\nThroughout the process, I constantly checked my approach for consistency and correctness, making adjustments as needed to ensure the solution was valid.",
  "ground_truth": "From the given equations, $y + z = 4 - x$ and $y^2 + z^2 = 6 - x^2.$  By Cauchy-Schwarz,\n\\[(1 + 1)(y^2 + z^2) \\ge (y + z)^2.\\]Hence, $2(6 - x^2) \\ge (4 - x)^2.$  This simplifies to $3x^2 - 8x + 4 \\le 0,$ which factors as $(x - 2)(3x - 2) \\le 0.$  Hence, $\\frac{2}{3} \\le x \\le 2.$\n\nFor $x = \\frac{3}{2},$ we can take $y = z = \\frac{5}{3}.$  For $x = 2,$ we can take $y = z = 1.$  Thus, $m = \\frac{2}{3}$ and $M = 2,$ so $m + M = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}}.$"
