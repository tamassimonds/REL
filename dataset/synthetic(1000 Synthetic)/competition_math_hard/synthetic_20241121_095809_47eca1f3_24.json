  "problem": "A bowl contains 10 jellybeans (four red, one blue and five white). If you pick three jellybeans from the bowl at random and without replacement, what is the probability that exactly two will be red? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem just like we would in real life, exploring different strategies, reflecting along the way, and checking our work frequently. Here's how I would approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nAlright, so we have a bowl with 10 jellybeans: four red, one blue, and five white. We need to find the probability that exactly two out of three jellybeans picked are red.\n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n\n1. **Combination Approach:** This reminds me of probability problems where we use combinations to calculate the total possible outcomes and the favorable outcomes. Maybe I can find the total ways to pick three jellybeans and then find the ways to pick exactly two reds.\n\n2. **Probability Step-by-Step:** Alternatively, I could calculate the probability of picking two reds and one non-red in sequence.\n\n3. **Simulation:** Another idea is to simulate the picks, but that seems more suited for computer-based solutions and less practical here.\n\n**Leaning Towards:** The **Combination Approach** seems straightforward and familiar for these types of problems. Let's start with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Total Number of Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI need to know the total number of ways to pick any three jellybeans from the bowl. This will be my denominator in the probability fraction.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nUse combinations:  \n\\[\n\\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat makes sense\u2014120 different ways to pick three jellybeans out of ten. The denominator is set.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Favorable Outcomes for Exactly Two Red Jellybeans**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to find the number of ways to pick exactly two red jellybeans and one non-red jellybean. This will be my numerator.\n\n**Breaking It Down:**\n\n1. **Choose 2 Red Jellybeans:**  \n   There are four red jellybeans available.\n\n2. **Choose 1 Non-Red Jellybean:**  \n   There are six non-red jellybeans (one blue and five white).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Combinations for Red:**  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n  \\]\n  \n- **Combinations for Non-Red:**  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{6}{1} = 6\n  \\]\n\n- **Total Favorable Outcomes:**  \n  Multiply the two:  \n  \\[\n  6 \\times 6 = 36\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, there are 36 ways to pick two reds and one non-red. That feels reasonable given the numbers.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIf I had more or fewer red jellybeans, would these numbers still make sense? Since we have four reds, picking two out of them should yield six combinations, which aligns with my calculation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have both the total and favorable outcomes, I can find the probability by dividing the two.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{36}{120}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{36}{120} = \\frac{36 \\div 12}{120 \\div 12} = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\\(\\frac{3}{10}\\) seems like a plausible probability. It's a neat fraction, which is often the case in these problems.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this fraction make sense in the context? A 30% chance to pick exactly two reds out of three feels right, considering there are four reds out of ten jellybeans.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach with an Alternative Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, let me double-check using the **Probability Step-by-Step** approach to ensure consistency.\n\n**Alternative Method: Probability Sequence**\n\n1. **First Pick:** Probability of picking a red jellybean.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Pick:** Probability of picking another red, given the first was red.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Pick:** Probability of picking a non-red jellybean.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}\n   \\]\n\n**Total Probability for This Sequence:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{6}{60} = \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute:**  \nThis only accounts for one specific sequence (red, red, non-red). But there are multiple sequences possible (e.g., red, non-red, red), so I need to consider all of them.\n\n**Realization:**  \nI need to multiply by the number of ways to arrange two reds and one non-red.\n\n**Number of Arrangements:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{3!}{2! \\times 1!} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Adjusted Total Probability:**  \n\\[\n3 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth methods agree! This consistency boosts my confidence in the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Step: Stating the Answer Clearly**\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\\[\n\\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nBy exploring both the combination method and the probability sequence method, and ensuring both lead to the same result, I\u2019m confident that the probability of picking exactly two red jellybeans is \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\). Checking my work along the way helped catch potential missteps and confirm the correctness of the approach.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Total Combinations:** 120 ways to pick any three jellybeans.\n- **Favorable Outcomes:** 36 ways to pick exactly two reds and one non-red.\n- **Probability:** \\(\\frac{36}{120} = \\frac{3}{10}\\).\n- **Verification:** Both combination and sequential probability methods agree.\n\nThrough brainstorming, reflecting, and verifying with multiple strategies, we've arrived at a reliable solution.",
  "ground_truth": "First, we consider how many total sets of three jellybeans we can select, which is very simply ${10 \\choose 3} = 120$, if we treat all 10 jellybeans as distinct. Now, if we have exactly 2 red jellybeans, there are ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs of red jellybeans, and $5+1 = 6$ choices for the third non-red jellybean. So, there are $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$ successful outcomes. So our probability is $\\frac{6 \\cdot 6}{120} = \\frac{6}{20} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$."
