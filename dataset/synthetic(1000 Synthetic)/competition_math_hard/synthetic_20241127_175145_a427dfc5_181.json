  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst thoughts:\n\n- **Vertex Given:** The parabola has a vertex at \\((5,3)\\) with a vertical axis of symmetry. This reminds me of the vertex form of a quadratic equation.\n  \n- **Point on the Parabola:** It also passes through \\((2,0)\\). So, I have an additional point to work with.\n\n- **Objective:** Find \\(a + b + c\\) for the equation \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\).\n\nInitial reaction:\n\n- This looks like a problem involving quadratic equations. I'll need to find the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) by using the given information. \n\n- I remember there are different forms of quadratic equations\u2014maybe I can use the vertex form to make things easier.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nPossible strategies:\n\n1. **Vertex Form Approach:** Use the vertex form of a parabola \\(y = a(x-h)^2 + k\\), where \\((h,k)\\) is the vertex. Plug in the given points to solve for \\(a\\), then expand to find \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n2. **Standard Form with Systems of Equations:** Use the standard form \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) and create a system of equations using the given points, including the vertex.\n\n3. **Completing the Square:** Start with the standard form and complete the square to relate it to the vertex form.\n\nInitial preference:\n\n- The **Vertex Form Approach** seems the most straightforward since we already know the vertex. I'll start with that, but I'm open to switching if it doesn't work out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Trying the Vertex Form Approach**\n\nThought process:\n\n- Using the vertex form:  \n  \\[\n  y = a(x - h)^2 + k\n  \\]  \n  Here, \\((h, k) = (5, 3)\\), so:  \n  \\[\n  y = a(x - 5)^2 + 3\n  \\]\n\n- Plug in the point \\((2, 0)\\) to solve for \\(a\\):  \n  \\[\n  0 = a(2 - 5)^2 + 3  \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  0 = a(9) + 3  \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  0 = 9a + 3  \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  9a = -3  \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a = -\\frac{1}{3}  \n  \\]\n\nReflection:\n\n- **Does this make sense?** By substituting the point into the equation, I was able to solve for \\(a\\). The value seems reasonable.\n\n- Now, I need to express the equation in standard form to find \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Expanding to Standard Form**\n\nThought process:\n\n- Starting with:  \n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{1}{3}(x - 5)^2 + 3  \n  \\]\n\n- Expanding \\( (x - 5)^2 \\):  \n  \\[\n  (x - 5)^2 = x^2 - 10x + 25  \n  \\]\n\n- Substitute back:  \n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{1}{3}(x^2 - 10x + 25) + 3  \n  \\]\n\n- Distribute the \\(a\\) value:  \n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{1}{3}x^2 + \\frac{10}{3}x - \\frac{25}{3} + 3  \n  \\]\n\n- Combine constants:  \n  \\[\n  3 = \\frac{9}{3}  \n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{1}{3}x^2 + \\frac{10}{3}x - \\frac{25}{3} + \\frac{9}{3}  \n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{1}{3}x^2 + \\frac{10}{3}x - \\frac{16}{3}  \n  \\]\n\nCheck:\n\n- **Does this look correct?** The equation is now in standard form \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) with:\n  - \\(a = -\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n  - \\(b = \\frac{10}{3}\\)\n  - \\(c = -\\frac{16}{3}\\)\n\n- **Quick verification:** I'll substitute the vertex back into the equation to ensure it holds.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Vertex**\n\nQuick check:\n\n- At \\(x = 5\\):  \n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{1}{3}(5)^2 + \\frac{10}{3}(5) - \\frac{16}{3}  \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{25}{3} + \\frac{50}{3} - \\frac{16}{3}  \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{50 - 25 - 16}{3} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3  \n  \\]\n\nReflection:\n\n- **Is the vertex correct?** Yes, the vertex \\((5,3)\\) satisfies the equation. This confirms that the calculations are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating \\(a + b + c\\)**\n\nThought process:\n\n- Now that I have \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), I can simply add them together:\n\n\\[\na + b + c = -\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{16}{3}\n\\]\n\n- Performing the addition:\n\n\\[\na + b + c = \\frac{-1 + 10 - 16}{3} = \\frac{-7}{3}\n\\]\n\nCheck:\n\n- **Does this result make sense?** Given the coefficients, the sum seems reasonable.\n\n- **Quick mental math check:**  \n  \\[\n  -1 + 10 = 9  \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  9 - 16 = -7  \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{-7}{3} = -\\frac{7}{3}  \n  \\]\n\nReflection:\n\n- **Is everything consistent?** Yes, the calculations are consistent, and the final answer checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\\[\na + b + c = -\\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Reflecting on the Approach**\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\n- **Was the Vertex Form the Right Choice?**  \n  Yes, starting with the vertex form made it straightforward to incorporate the given vertex and solve for \\(a\\) using the additional point.\n\n- **Were There Any Challenges?**  \n  Not particularly; the calculations flowed smoothly once the vertex form was applied.\n\n- **Is the Solution Verified?**  \n  Yes, the vertex check confirms that the derived equation is correct.\n\n- **Would Another Method Work Better?**  \n  The standard form approach would have been more complex, requiring a system of equations. The vertex form was more efficient in this case.\n\nReflection summary:\n\n- **Overall Assessment:**  \n  The initial strategy worked well, and the solution was verified through multiple checks. The final answer is consistent with the given conditions of the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy **starting with the vertex form** of the quadratic equation and using the given point to solve for \\(a\\), I smoothly transitioned to the standard form to identify \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). Throughout the process, I consistently **checked and verified** each step to ensure accuracy, ultimately arriving at the correct sum of coefficients:\n\n\\[\na + b + c = -\\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\nThis method proved efficient and reliable, confirming the correctness of the solution.",
  "ground_truth": "Since the axis of symmetry is vertical and the vertex is $(5,3)$, the parabola may also be written as  \\[y=a(x-5)^2+3\\]for some value of $a$.  Plugging the point $(2,0)$ into this equation gives  \\[0=a(2-5)^2+3=9a+3.\\]This tells us $a=-\\frac13$.\n\nOur equation is  \\[y=-\\frac13(x-5)^2+3.\\]Putting it $y=ax^2+bx+c$ form requires expanding the square, so we get  \\[y=-\\frac13(x^2-10x+25)+3={-\\frac13 x^2+\\frac{10}{3}x-\\frac{16}3}.\\]Therefore, $a+b+c = \\boxed{-\\frac73}$."
