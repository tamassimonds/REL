  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this step by step, just like how I'd naturally think through it.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, it reminds me of centroid properties and coordinate geometry. I know that dealing with polygons and their midpoints often involves averaging coordinates. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to apply it directly to a multi-step process like this.\n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n\n- **Centroid Approach:** Maybe it's about finding the centroid of the polygons?\n- **Symmetry Properties:** Could it involve symmetry properties?\n- **Vector Operations:** Or perhaps using vector operations?\n\nI'm leaning towards exploring how the coordinates transform from one polygon to the next. But if that doesn't work out, I might need to reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Given Information**\n\nWe have a 100-gon \\( P_1 \\) with the sum of the \\( x \\)-coordinates equal to 2009. Then, midpoints of \\( P_1 \\) form \\( P_2 \\), and midpoints of \\( P_2 \\) form \\( P_3 \\). Our goal is to find the sum of the \\( x \\)-coordinates of \\( P_3 \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- The process involves repeatedly taking midpoints, which suggests averaging.\n- I need to see how taking midpoints affects the sum of coordinates.\n\n**Idea:**\n\nEach step seems to reduce or transform the sum of the \\( x \\)-coordinates. Let's explore how that works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Centroid Approach**\n\n- Maybe the sum of the \\( x \\)-coordinates relates to the centroid of the polygons.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, but the centroid involves both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) coordinates, and we only have information about \\( x \\). This might not be the most straightforward path.\n\n**Strategy 2: Vector Averaging**\n\n- Consider how midpoints are calculated and see how sums evolve.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThis feels more aligned since midpoints are averages of endpoints. Let's proceed with this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Midpoints from \\( P_1 \\) to \\( P_2 \\)**\n\nEach vertex of \\( P_2 \\) is the midpoint of a side of \\( P_1 \\). So, if we denote vertices of \\( P_1 \\) by \\( A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{100} \\), then vertices of \\( P_2 \\) are:\n\n\\[\nM_i = \\frac{A_i + A_{i+1}}{2} \\quad \\text{(wrap around)}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- The sum of all midpoints' \\( x \\)-coordinates in \\( P_2 \\) should relate to the sum of \\( x \\)-coordinates in \\( P_1 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of } x \\text{-coordinates of } P_2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\frac{x_i + x_{i+1}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying,\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_i + x_{i+1})\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nSince it's a closed polygon, \\( x_{101} = x_1 \\). So, each \\( x_i \\) appears twice in the sum.\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i = 2009\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, interesting! The sum remains 2009. I wasn't expecting that, but it makes sense because each \\( x_i \\) contributes fully through averaging.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Transitioning from \\( P_2 \\) to \\( P_3 \\)**\n\nNow, apply the same midpoint process to \\( P_2 \\) to form \\( P_3 \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- If the sum remained unchanged from \\( P_1 \\) to \\( P_2 \\), maybe it will remain unchanged again.\n- But let's verify it through calculations.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSuppose the sum of \\( x \\)-coordinates of \\( P_2 \\) is \\( S_2 = 2009 \\). Then, forming \\( P_3 \\) by taking midpoints of \\( P_2 \\):\n\n\\[\nS_3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_i^{(2)} + x_{i+1}^{(2)}) = S_2 = 2009\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIt seems consistent. The sum doesn't change through each midpoint transformation.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this align with intuition? Yes, because taking midpoints averages out the coordinates without altering the total sum.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- Is there any property of polygons that supports this?\n- Maybe the conservation of the sum of coordinates during affine transformations?\n\n**Idea:**\n\nThis resonates with how linear transformations preserve certain sums. Midpoint operations are linear, so the sum remains invariant.\n\n**Alternative Check:**\n\nSuppose instead of a 100-gon, we test with a simpler shape, like a quadrilateral. Does the sum remain constant?\n\n**Quick Test:**\n\nFor a square with \\( x \\)-coordinates summing to a certain value, taking midpoints doesn't change the sum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe approach seems solid.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>**\n\nThe sum of the \\( x \\)-coordinates of the vertices of \\( P_3 \\) is **2009**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Reflection:** Initially, I wasn't sure if the sum would remain constant through each step, but the calculations confirmed it.\n- **Check:** Testing with a simpler case reinforced the correctness of the approach.\n- **Confidence:** Now, I'm confident that the sum remains unchanged through each midpoint transformation.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n  \n Wait, let's try another perspective to ensure the correctness. What if we consider a different method?\n\n**Suppose:**\n\nLet's assume that after each transformation, the sum of the \\( x \\)-coordinates decreases by a certain factor. Does that make sense?\n\n**Quick Calculation:**\n\nBut looking back at the calculations, there was no decrease from \\( P_1 \\) to \\( P_2 \\). So, perhaps the sum remains constant throughout.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nYes, the original approach holds. The sum of the \\( x \\)-coordinates remains **2009** through each transformation.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step process reflects a natural human approach to solving the problem\u2014starting with brainstorming, exploring strategies, verifying through calculations, and continually checking for correctness.\n\nIf you'd like further clarification or another angle, feel free to let me know!",
  "ground_truth": "Let the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_1$ be $x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_{100}$.  Then, by the midpoint formula, the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_2$ are $\\frac{x_1+x_2}2,\\frac{x_2+x_3}2,\\ldots,\\frac{x_{100}+x_1}2 $.  The sum of these equals $\\frac{2x_1+2x_2+\\cdots +2x_{100}}2=x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_{100}$.  Similarly, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$ equals the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of  $P_2$.  Thus the desired answer is $\\boxed{2009}$."
