  "solution": "### Exploring Different Strategies\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, it's about angles \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) that are both positive integers. We know that:\n\n- \\( A \\) is a multiple of \\( B \\).\n- \\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\) (they are complementary angles).\n\n**Goal:** Determine how many possible measures exist for angle \\( A \\).\n\n---\n\n### First Thoughts and Brainstorming\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\nThis reminds me of basic geometry where complementary angles sum up to 90 degrees. I recall problems involving multiples and factors, so maybe factors of 90 come into play.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Express \\( A \\) in terms of \\( B \\):** Since \\( A \\) is a multiple of \\( B \\), we can write \\( A = kB \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\n2. **Set Up an Equation:** Use the complementary condition \\( A + B = 90 \\) to form an equation.\n\n3. **Explore Values of \\( k \\):** Find which values of \\( k \\) satisfy all conditions.\n\n4. **List Possible \\( B \\) Values:** Given \\( B \\) must be a divisor of 90.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nExpressing \\( A \\) in terms of \\( B \\) and using the complementary condition seems like a solid starting point. Let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### Setting Up the Equation\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Given:\n  - \\( A = kB \\) (since \\( A \\) is a multiple of \\( B \\))\n  - \\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\) (since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are complementary)\n\n- **Substituting \\( A \\):**\n  \\[\n  kB + B = 90^\\circ\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  B(k + 1) = 90\n  \\]\n\n- **Solving for \\( B \\):**\n  \\[\n  B = \\frac{90}{k + 1}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis equation makes sense because \\( B \\) must be a positive integer, so \\( k + 1 \\) must be a divisor of 90. This gives us a clear direction to find possible values of \\( k \\).\n\n---\n\n### Identifying Valid \\( k \\) Values\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Objective:** Find integer values of \\( k \\) such that \\( k + 1 \\) is a divisor of 90.\n\n- **Possible Divisors of 90:** Let's list them to see which correspond to \\( k + 1 \\).\n\n- **Calculations:**\n\n  | \\( k + 1 \\) | \\( k \\)  |\n  |------------|----------|\n  | 1          | 0        |\n  | 2          | 1        |\n  | 3          | 2        |\n  | 5          | 4        |\n  | 6          | 5        |\n  | 9          | 8        |\n  | 10         | 9        |\n  | 15         | 14       |\n  | 18         | 17       |\n  | 30         | 29       |\n  | 45         | 44       |\n  | 90         | 89       |\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute, \\( k = 0 \\) would mean \\( A = 0 \\), which doesn't satisfy the condition that \\( A \\) is a positive integer. So, we need to discard \\( k = 0 \\). All other \\( k \\) values are valid.\n\n**Valid \\( k \\) Values:** 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 14, 17, 29, 44, 89\n\n---\n\n### Calculating Corresponding \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) Values\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Objective:** For each valid \\( k \\), calculate:\n  \\[\n  B = \\frac{90}{k + 1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad A = kB\n  \\]\n\n- **Step-by-Step Calculations:**\n\n  | \\( k \\) | \\( k + 1 \\) | \\( B = \\frac{90}{k + 1} \\) | \\( A = kB \\) |\n  |---------|------------|---------------------------|--------------|\n  | 1       | 2          | 45                        | 45           |\n  | 2       | 3          | 30                        | 60           |\n  | 4       | 5          | 18                        | 72           |\n  | 5       | 6          | 15                        | 75           |\n  | 8       | 9          | 10                        | 80           |\n  | 9       | 10         | 9                         | 81           |\n  | 14      | 15         | 6                         | 84           |\n  | 17      | 18         | 5                         | 85           |\n  | 29      | 30         | 3                         | 87           |\n  | 44      | 45         | 2                         | 88           |\n  | 89      | 90         | 1                         | 89           |\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThese calculations seem correct. Each pair \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) adds up to 90 degrees, and \\( A \\) is a multiple of \\( B \\). Let's double-check one to be sure.\n\n- **Example Check:** For \\( k = 2 \\):\n  \\[\n  k + 1 = 3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  B = \\frac{90}{3} = 30\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  A = 2 \\times 30 = 60\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  A + B = 60 + 30 = 90 \\quad \\text{\u2714\ufe0f}\n  \\]\n\n**Valid Angles \\( A \\):** 45, 60, 72, 75, 80, 81, 84, 85, 87, 88, 89\n\n---\n\n### Final Check and Conclusion\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Objective:** Confirm that all calculated angles \\( A \\) satisfy the original conditions:\n  - \\( A \\) is a positive integer.\n  - \\( A \\) is a multiple of \\( B \\).\n  - \\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\).\n\n- **Quick Verification:**\n  - All \\( A \\) values are positive integers.\n  - Each \\( A \\) is a multiple of its corresponding \\( B \\).\n  - The sum \\( A + B \\) equals 90 degrees in all cases.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The approach was correct, and all conditions are satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the Solution\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by identifying that \\( A \\) is a multiple of \\( B \\) and that \\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\). Considered expressing \\( A \\) in terms of \\( B \\) and setting up an equation.\n\n- **Setting Up the Equation:** Derived \\( B(k + 1) = 90 \\) and solved for \\( B \\) as \\( \\frac{90}{k + 1} \\).\n\n- **Identifying Valid \\( k \\) Values:** Determined that \\( k + 1 \\) must be a divisor of 90 and listed the corresponding \\( k \\) values, discarding \\( k = 0 \\) since \\( A \\) must be positive.\n\n- **Calculating Corresponding Angles:** For each valid \\( k \\), calculated \\( B \\) and \\( A \\), ensuring that \\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\) and \\( A \\) is a multiple of \\( B \\).\n\n- **Final Check:** Verified that all conditions are met for each pair of angles.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>**\n\nThere are 11 possible measures for angle \\( A \\):\n\\[ \n45^\\circ, 60^\\circ, 72^\\circ, 75^\\circ, 80^\\circ, 81^\\circ, 84^\\circ, 85^\\circ, 87^\\circ, 88^\\circ, \\text{and } 89^\\circ \n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The given information tells us that $A = 90^\\circ -B$ and $A=kB$ for some $k\\ge1$.  Therefore, we have $kB = 90^\\circ - B$. This simplifies to $(k+1)B=90^\\circ$. $k+1$ can be any factor of $90$ except one, since $k+1\\ge2$. $90=2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5$ has $2\\cdot3\\cdot2=12$ factors, so there are 11 possible values of $k$. Each value of $k$ uniquely determines the value of $B$ and therefore the value of $A$, so there are $\\boxed{11}$ possible measures for $A$."
