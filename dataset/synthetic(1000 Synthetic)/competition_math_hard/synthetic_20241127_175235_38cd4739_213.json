  "solution": "Certainly! Let's transform the original working into a polished, concise solution while preserving the thought process and ensuring coherence. We'll maintain the final answer as \\(-14\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Problem Statement**\n\nFind the product of all real values of \\( r \\) such that the equation \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2x} = \\frac{r-x}{7}\n\\]\n\nhas exactly **one real solution**.\n\n---\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nTo tackle this problem, we'll explore strategies to determine the conditions under which the given equation has exactly one real solution. Our goal is to identify all such real values of \\( r \\) and compute their product.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplifying the Equation**\n\n**First Thought:**  \nThe equation involves fractions, so eliminating them might simplify our approach.\n\n**Action:**  \nCross-multiply to remove the fractions:\n\n\\[\n7 \\cdot 1 = 2x \\cdot (r - x)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n7 = 2x(r - x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n\\[\n7 = 2xr - 2x^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis resembles a quadratic equation in terms of \\( x \\). Let's rearrange it into standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 2xr + 7 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 2xr + 7 = 0\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Discriminant**\n\n**First Thought:**  \nFor a quadratic equation to have exactly one real solution, its discriminant must be zero (\\(\\Delta = 0\\)).\n\n**Action:**  \nRecall the discriminant formula for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nIdentify coefficients:\n\n\\[\na = 2,\\quad b = -2r,\\quad c = 7\n\\]\n\nCompute the discriminant:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-2r)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 = 4r^2 - 56\n\\]\n\nSet the discriminant to zero for exactly one real solution:\n\n\\[\n4r^2 - 56 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[\n4r^2 = 56 \\\\\nr^2 = 14 \\\\\nr = \\pm\\sqrt{14}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWe've found two real values for \\( r \\): \\( \\sqrt{14} \\) and \\( -\\sqrt{14} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Product of \\( r \\) Values**\n\n**First Thought:**  \nThe problem asks for the product of all real values of \\( r \\) identified.\n\n**Action:**  \nCompute the product:\n\n\\[\nr_1 \\times r_2 = \\sqrt{14} \\times (-\\sqrt{14}) = -14\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe product is \\(-14\\), which makes sense since multiplying a positive and a negative square root yields a negative number.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**First Thought:**  \nVerification is crucial to ensure the correctness of our solution.\n\n**Action:**  \nLet's substitute one of the \\( r \\) values back into the original equation to check.\n\n**Example:**  \nTake \\( r = \\sqrt{14} \\).\n\nSubstitute into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2x} = \\frac{\\sqrt{14} - x}{7}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiply:\n\n\\[\n7 = 2x(\\sqrt{14} - x) \\\\\n7 = 2x\\sqrt{14} - 2x^2\n\\]\n\nRearrange to form a quadratic:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 2x\\sqrt{14} + 7 = 0\n\\]\n\nCompute the discriminant:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-2\\sqrt{14})^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 = 56 - 56 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe discriminant is zero, confirming that there is exactly one real solution for \\( x \\). This verification supports our earlier findings.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough systematic cross-multiplying, applying the discriminant condition, calculating the product of \\( r \\) values, and verifying the solution, we've determined that the product of all real values of \\( r \\) is \\(-14\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-14}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nBy embracing different strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying the results, we've confidently arrived at the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "Observe first that $x=0$ is not a solution to the equation since it makes the denominator of $\\frac{1}{2x}$ equal to 0.  For $x\\neq 0$, we may multiply both sides by both denominators and move all the resulting terms to the left-hand side to get $2x^2-2rx+7=0$. Observe that there are two ways the original equation could have exactly one solution.  Either $2x^2-2rx+7=0$ has two solutions and one of them is 0, or else $2x^2-2rx+7=0$ has exactly one nonzero solution.  By trying $x=0$, we rule out the first possibility.\n\nConsidering the expression $\\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the solutions of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we find that there is exactly one solution if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is zero.  Setting $(-2r)^2-4(2)(7)$ equal to 0 gives $4r^2-4(14) = 0$.  Add 4(14) and divide by 4 to find $r^2=14$.  The two solutions of this equation are $\\sqrt{14}$ and $-\\sqrt{14}$, and their product is $\\boxed{-14}$."
