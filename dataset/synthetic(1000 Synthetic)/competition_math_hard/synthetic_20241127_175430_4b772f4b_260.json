  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step and create a coherent solution by reflecting on the thought process, exploring different strategies, checking the work, and summarizing the final answer. I'll walk through it as naturally as possible, just like brainstorming on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nWe need to factor \\(36 - 9x^2\\).\n\n---\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **First Impression:** This expression looks like a quadratic, but it's not in the standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\).\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Difference of Squares:** It reminds me of the difference of squares formula.\n  - **Factoring Out a Common Factor:** Maybe there's a common factor I can pull out first.\n  - **Rearranging:** Perhaps rearranging the terms could help, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nI think I'll start by exploring the **difference of squares** since that's what comes to mind first. If that doesn't work, I'll consider other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Difference of Squares**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe expression \\(36 - 9x^2\\) resembles the difference of squares formula:\n\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\n\\]\n\nBut to apply this, I need to identify \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) within the expression.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\n- **Can I Rewrite as Squares?**\n  - \\(36\\) is \\(6^2\\)\n  - \\(9x^2\\) is \\((3x)^2\\)\n\nSo, it fits the pattern:\n\n\\[\n36 - 9x^2 = (6)^2 - (3x)^2\n\\]\n\n**Applying the Formula:**\n\n\\[\n(6)^2 - (3x)^2 = (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Look Right?** It seems correct, but I notice that both factors have a common multiple of 3. Maybe I can simplify it further by factoring out the 3.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work: Can It Be Factored Further?**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLooking at \\( (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x) \\), I see that both terms have a 3. Perhaps I can factor out the 3 to make the expression cleaner.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\n- **Factor Out 3 from Each Bracket:**\n\n\\[\n6 - 3x = 3(2 - x)\n\\]\n\\[\n6 + 3x = 3(2 + x)\n\\]\n\n- **Substituting Back:**\n\n\\[\n(6 - 3x)(6 + 3x) = [3(2 - x)][3(2 + x)] = 3 \\times 3 \\times (2 - x)(2 + x) = 9(2 - x)(2 + x)\n\\]\n\n**Final Factored Form:**\n\n\\[\n36 - 9x^2 = 9(2 - x)(2 + x)\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nLet's expand it back to ensure it matches the original expression:\n\n\\[\n9(2 - x)(2 + x) = 9[(2)^2 - (x)^2] = 9(4 - x^2) = 36 - 9x^2\n\\]\n\n**Outcome:** It matches perfectly, confirming that our factoring is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Factoring Out a Common Factor First**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore applying the difference of squares, maybe I should have factored out a common factor right from the start. Let's see if that approach is more straightforward.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\n- **Identify the Common Factor:**\n  - Both terms (\\(36\\) and \\(9x^2\\)) have a factor of 9.\n\n- **Factor Out 9:**\n\n\\[\n36 - 9x^2 = 9(4 - x^2)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow, inside the parentheses, I have \\(4 - x^2\\), which is still a difference of squares. This simplifies the problem and makes the next step easier.\n\n**Applying Difference of Squares Again:**\n\n\\[\n4 - x^2 = (2)^2 - (x)^2 = (2 - x)(2 + x)\n\\]\n\n**Final Factored Form:**\n\n\\[\n36 - 9x^2 = 9(2 - x)(2 + x)\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nExpanding back to the original:\n\n\\[\n9(2 - x)(2 + x) = 9(4 - x^2) = 36 - 9x^2\n\\]\n\n**Outcome:** It checks out again! This method works just as well, and it might actually be a cleaner approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Rearranging the Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWhat if I tried to rearrange the expression differently or think of it as a quadratic equation? Maybe writing it as \\(9x^2 - 36\\) could help.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\n- **Rearrange:**\n\n\\[\n9x^2 - 36 = 0\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** But wait, setting it equal to zero isn't necessary for factoring the expression. This doesn't really lead anywhere useful for our purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:** Rearranging doesn't help in this case. So, I'll stick with the previous methods that were successful.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection: Which Strategy Was Best?**\n\n**Comparing Strategies:**\n\n- **Strategy 1 (Difference of Squares):** Worked well, but required an additional step to factor out the common multiple.\n- **Strategy 2 (Factoring Out a Common Factor First):** More straightforward as it simplifies the expression upfront, making the subsequent steps cleaner.\n- **Strategy 3 (Rearranging):** Not helpful in this context.\n\n**Preferred Approach:**\n\n- **Factor Out the Common Factor First:** By extracting the common factor (9) at the beginning, the expression becomes simpler, and applying the difference of squares is more straightforward.\n\nThis approach minimizes the risk of missing further factorization and makes the process more efficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Final Answer**\n\n**<ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n36 - 9x^2 = 9(2 - x)(2 + x)\n\\]\n\n**</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Expanding the Factored Form**\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let's expand the final factored form to verify it matches the original expression:\n\n\\[\n9(2 - x)(2 + x) = 9[(2)^2 - (x)^2] = 9(4 - x^2) = 36 - 9x^2\n\\]\n\n**Outcome:** It matches perfectly, confirming that our factoring is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary: Bringing It All Together**\n\nBy exploring multiple strategies, reflecting at each step, and checking the work, we've confidently factored \\(36 - 9x^2\\) into \\(9(2 - x)(2 + x)\\). \n\n- **Initial Strategy:** Applying the difference of squares worked but led us to recognize a common factor that could simplify the expression further.\n- **Optimal Strategy:** Factoring out the common factor first made the process more efficient and straightforward.\n- **Verification:** Expanding the final factored form confirmed the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Final Takeaway:** Always look for common factors first to simplify expressions before applying more complex factoring techniques.",
  "ground_truth": "We have $36-9x^2 = 6^2 - (3x)^2 = (6-3x)(6+3x)$.  We can factor a 3 out of each of $6-3x$ and $6+3x$ to give $3\\cdot(2-x)\\cdot 3\\cdot(2+x) = \\boxed{9(2-x)(2+x)}$. (We could also have factored out a 9 at the beginning: $36-9x^2 = 9(4-x^2)=9(2-x)(2+x)$.)"
