  "solution": "### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. The question asks for the mean of all solutions for \\( x \\) in the equation:\n\n\\[ \nx^3 + 3x^2 - 10x = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis looks like a cubic equation, and I recall that cubic equations can have up to three real roots. Maybe factoring could work here.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Factoring Out Common Terms:** Often, the first step with polynomial equations is to see if there's a common factor.\n2. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** If factoring reduces it to a quadratic, I can apply the quadratic formula.\n3. **Graphical Insight:** Visualizing the function to confirm the number of real roots and their behavior.\n4. **Calculating the Mean:** Once the roots are found, compute their average.\n\nLet's start by exploring **factoring out common terms** since it's straightforward and might simplify the equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Factoring Out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLooking at the equation, I notice that each term has an \\( x \\). Factoring out the greatest common factor could simplify things.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\nx(x^2 + 3x - 10) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nFactoring out \\( x \\) leaves us with a quadratic equation inside the parentheses. This is great because now we have a product of factors equal to zero, which means we can apply the **Zero Product Property**.\n\n**Zero Product Property:**  \nIf \\( ab = 0 \\), then either \\( a = 0 \\) or \\( b = 0 \\).\n\n**Applying It:**  \n\\[\nx = 0 \n\\]\nor\n\\[\nx^2 + 3x - 10 = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThis makes sense. We've identified one root already (\\( x = 0 \\)), and now we need to solve the quadratic to find the other roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to solve \\( x^2 + 3x - 10 = 0 \\). Factoring quadratics is often possible, but if it doesn't factor neatly, I can always fall back on the **quadratic formula**:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 3 \\), and \\( c = -10 \\).\n\n**Attempting to Factor:**  \nBefore jumping to the quadratic formula, let's see if it can be factored.\n\n- Looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-10\\) and add to \\(3\\).\n- Hmm, \\(5\\) and \\(-2\\) work because \\(5 \\times (-2) = -10\\) and \\(5 + (-2) = 3\\).\n\n**Verification:**  \n\\[\nx^2 + 3x - 10 = (x + 5)(x - 2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGreat! Factoring worked. Now we can apply the Zero Product Property again.\n\n**Applying Zero Product Property:**  \n\\[\nx + 5 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 2 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solutions:**  \n\\[\nx = -5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = 2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nSo, the roots are \\( x = 0 \\), \\( x = -5 \\), and \\( x = 2 \\). Let me quickly verify by plugging these back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.\n\n- For \\( x = 0 \\):  \n  \\[\n  0^3 + 3(0)^2 - 10(0) = 0 \\quad \u2714\ufe0f\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( x = -5 \\):  \n  \\[\n  (-5)^3 + 3(-5)^2 - 10(-5) = -125 + 75 + 50 = 0 \\quad \u2714\ufe0f\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( x = 2 \\):  \n  \\[\n  2^3 + 3(2)^2 - 10(2) = 8 + 12 - 20 = 0 \\quad \u2714\ufe0f\n  \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll roots satisfy the original equation. This confirms that our factoring and solutions are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Mean of the Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that we have all the solutions (\\( x = 0, -5, 2 \\)), we need to find their mean (average).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{{0 + (-5) + 2}}{3} = \\frac{{-3}}{3} = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe mean is \\(-1\\). Let me think about whether this makes sense. Given the roots include negative and positive values, averaging them to \\(-1\\) seems reasonable.\n\n**Check:**  \nA quick mental check:  \n- The sum of the roots is \\(-3\\).  \n- Dividing by the number of roots (\\(3\\)) gives \\(-1\\).  \nNo errors here.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThe mean of all solutions for \\( x \\) is \\(-1\\).  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by identifying the equation as cubic and considered factoring as the first strategy.\n\n- **Factoring:** Successfully factored out the greatest common factor \\( x \\), reducing the equation to a quadratic.\n\n- **Solving Quadratic:** Attempted factoring the quadratic, which worked perfectly, yielding two additional roots.\n\n- **Verification:** Plugged all roots back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.\n\n- **Calculating Mean:** Averaged the three roots to find the mean, resulting in \\(-1\\).\n\nThroughout the process, I consistently checked each step to ensure correctness, adjusting strategies when necessary, and confirming the validity of the solutions.",
  "ground_truth": "First, we factor the equation as $x(x^2 +3x - 10) = 0$.  So, one solution is $x=0$ and the other two solutions are the solutions to $x^2 + 3x-10=0$.  We could either factor the quadratic, or note that the sum of the solutions to this quadratic is $-(3/1)=-3$, so the mean of the three solutions to the original equation is $-3/3=\\boxed{-1}$."
