We'll maintain the structure, ensuring the thought process is clear and logical, leading to the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe task is to find the sum of all two-digit values of \\( d \\) such that dividing 109 by \\( d \\) leaves a remainder of 4. In mathematical terms:\n\n\\[\n109 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{d}\n\\]\n\nThis implies that \\( d \\) must be a divisor of \\( 109 - 4 = 105 \\). Therefore, our goal is to identify all two-digit divisors of 105 and sum them up.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Factoring 105:**\n   - Find the prime factors of 105 to determine all its divisors.\n\n2. **Listing Divisors:**\n   - Generate all divisors from the prime factors and identify the two-digit ones.\n\n3. **Calculating the Sum:**\n   - Add up the identified two-digit divisors to find the final answer.\n\nGiven these options, **factoring 105** seems the most straightforward and efficient approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Factoring 105**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find all divisors, start with the prime factorization of 105.\n\n- **Check for smallest primes:**\n  - **2:** 105 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n  - **3:** Sum of digits \\(1 + 0 + 5 = 6\\), which is divisible by 3.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n105 \\div 3 = 35\n\\]\n\n- **Next factor:**\n  - **5:** 35 ends in 5, so divisible by 5.\n\n\\[\n35 \\div 5 = 7\n\\]\n\n- **Final factor:** 7 is a prime number.\n\n**Result:**\n\n\\[\n105 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nMultiplying back to verify:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 5 = 15,\\quad 15 \\times 7 = 105\n\\]\n\nIt checks out, so the prime factors are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Generating All Divisors of 105**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nUsing the prime factors, list all possible combinations to find all divisors.\n\n**Possible Combinations:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1 &= 3^0 \\times 5^0 \\times 7^0 \\\\\n3 &= 3^1 \\times 5^0 \\times 7^0 \\\\\n5 &= 3^0 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^0 \\\\\n7 &= 3^0 \\times 5^0 \\times 7^1 \\\\\n15 &= 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^0 \\\\\n21 &= 3^1 \\times 5^0 \\times 7^1 \\\\\n35 &= 3^0 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1 \\\\\n105 &= 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Listing All Divisors:**\n\n\\[\n1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 105\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThese are all the divisors of 105. Now, let's focus on identifying the two-digit ones.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Two-Digit Divisors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSelect the divisors that fall within the two-digit range (10 to 99).\n\n**Eligible Divisors:**\n\nFrom the list: 15, 21, 35\n\n- **Note:** 105 is a three-digit number, so it\u2019s excluded.\n\n**Final Two-Digit Divisors:**\n\n\\[\n15, 21, 35\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nEnsure each divides 105 evenly:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n105 \\div 15 &= 7\\quad (\\text{integer}) \\\\\n105 \\div 21 &= 5\\quad (\\text{integer}) \\\\\n105 \\div 35 &= 3\\quad (\\text{integer}) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAll results are integers, confirming their validity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Summing the Two-Digit Divisors**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n15 + 21 + 35\n\\]\n\n**Performing the Addition:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n15 + 21 &= 36 \\\\\n36 + 35 &= 71 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Final Sum:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{71}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAdding in different orders to confirm:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n21 + 35 &= 56 \\\\\n56 + 15 &= 71 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe sum remains consistent, verifying the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure no errors, consider checking all two-digit numbers to see if they divide 105 evenly. However, given the limited number of divisors identified through factoring, it's unlikely any were missed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe initial strategy is valid, and no additional two-digit divisors exist beyond those identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{71}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy factoring 105, listing all its divisors, and identifying the two-digit ones, we've determined that the sum of all eligible divisors is **71**. This method ensures accuracy by systematically breaking down the problem and verifying each step.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought**\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between remainders and divisors led us to focus on the divisors of 105. Factoring provided a clear path to identifying all necessary components, ensuring a reliable solution. Always double-checking each step helped maintain correctness throughout the process.",
  "ground_truth": "If 4 is subtracted from 109, the result is 105. Then each of the two-digit numbers that will divide 109 with a remainder of 4 will divide 105 exactly. Thus, the problem is equivalent to finding all two-digit divisors of 105. Since the prime factors of 105 are 3, 5, and 7, the divisors are $3\\times5$, $3\\times7$, and $5\\times7$, or $15, 21,\\text{and }35$ with a sum of $\\boxed{71}$."
