  "problem": "If $f(x)$ is a function, then we define the function $f^{(n)}(x)$ to be the result of $n$ applications of $f$ to $x$, where $n$ is a positive integer. For example, $f^{(3)}(x)=f(f(f(x)))$.\n\nWe define the $\\textit{order}$ of an input $x$ with respect to $f$ to be the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $f^{(m)}(x)=x$.\n\nNow suppose $f(x)$ is the function defined as the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $11$. What is the order of $5$ with respect to this function $f$?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, just like how I would approach it naturally. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting along the way, and checking my work to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with a function \\( f(x) \\) where \\( f(x) \\) is the remainder when \\( x^2 \\) is divided by 11. I need to find the **order** of 5 with respect to this function, meaning I need to determine the smallest positive integer \\( m \\) such that applying the function \\( m \\) times to 5 returns 5, i.e., \\( f^{(m)}(5) = 5 \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- This reminds me of problems involving modular arithmetic and fixed points.\n- Maybe I can compute \\( f^{(n)}(5) \\) for successive \\( n \\) until I get back to 5.\n- Alternatively, I could look for patterns or cycles in the outputs.\n- Not entirely sure which method will be quickest, but starting with direct computation might give some insight.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**1. Direct Computation Approach**\n\nLet's try computing \\( f^{(n)}(5) \\) for increasing \\( n \\) to see when it returns to 5.\n\n- **Thought Process:** This is straightforward\u2014just apply the function repeatedly and see what happens.\n\n**2. Looking for Cycles or Patterns**\n\nAlternatively, I could look for cycles in the outputs to identify when the function value repeats.\n\n- **Thought Process:** Functions like these often have cyclical behavior, especially with modular arithmetic. Identifying a cycle could save time.\n\n**3. Algebraic Approach**\n\nMaybe there's an algebraic way to determine when \\( f^{(m)}(5) = 5 \\) without computing each step.\n\n- **Thought Process:** This might involve solving equations, but I'm not sure if it's feasible given the definition of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDirect computation seems the most straightforward to start with. If it gets too cumbersome, I'll consider looking for patterns or cycles.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Direct Computation**\n\n**Let's begin by computing \\( f(5) \\):**\n\n\\[\nf(5) = 5^2 \\mod 11 = 25 \\mod 11 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- So, \\( f(5) = 3 \\). This means after one application, we don't get back to 5.\n- **Check:** Since \\( 25 \\div 11 = 2 \\) with a remainder of 3, the calculation seems correct.\n\n**Proceed to Compute \\( f^{(2)}(5) \\):**\n\n\\[\nf^{(2)}(5) = f(f(5)) = f(3) = 3^2 \\mod 11 = 9 \\mod 11 = 9\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- Now, \\( f^{(2)}(5) = 9 \\). Still not back to 5.\n- **Check:** \\( 9 \\mod 11 \\) is indeed 9 since 9 is less than 11.\n\n**Compute \\( f^{(3)}(5) \\):**\n\n\\[\nf^{(3)}(5) = f(9) = 9^2 \\mod 11 = 81 \\mod 11 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- \\( f^{(3)}(5) = 4 \\). No return to 5 yet.\n- **Check:** \\( 81 \\div 11 = 7 \\) with a remainder of 4, so that's correct.\n\n**Compute \\( f^{(4)}(5) \\):**\n\n\\[\nf^{(4)}(5) = f(4) = 4^2 \\mod 11 = 16 \\mod 11 = 5\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Aha!** \\( f^{(4)}(5) = 5 \\). We've returned to the original value after 4 applications.\n- **Check:** \\( 16 \\div 11 = 1 \\) with a remainder of 5, so the calculation is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIt seems that \\( m = 4 \\) is the smallest integer such that \\( f^{(m)}(5) = 5 \\). But to be sure, let's verify by computing one more step.\n\n**Compute \\( f^{(5)}(5) \\):**\n\n\\[\nf^{(5)}(5) = f(5) = 3 \\quad (\\text{as computed earlier})\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Wait a minute!** If \\( f^{(5)}(5) = 3 \\), then applying the function again doesn't return to 5 immediately. This suggests that the order might not be 4.\n- **Check:** This indicates a possible misinterpretation. Let me think about this again.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nInitially, I thought \\( m = 4 \\) since \\( f^{(4)}(5) = 5 \\). However, \\( f^{(5)}(5) = 3 \\), which means the sequence doesn't reset cleanly after 4 applications. This suggests that the order might be larger than 4.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\nPerhaps I need to look for a complete cycle where \\( f^{(m)}(5) = 5 \\) and all subsequent applications return to their previous states.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Looking for a Complete Cycle**\n\nInstead of stopping at the first return to 5, let's continue computing to see if a larger cycle exists.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Continuing Computation to Identify the Complete Cycle**\n\n**Compute \\( f^{(6)}(5) \\):**\n\n\\[\nf^{(6)}(5) = f(3) = 9 \\quad (\\text{as computed earlier})\n\\]\n\n**Compute \\( f^{(7)}(5) \\):**\n\n\\[\nf^{(7)}(5) = f(9) = 4 \\quad (\\text{as computed earlier})\n\\]\n\n**Compute \\( f^{(8)}(5) \\):**\n\n\\[\nf^{(8)}(5) = f(4) = 5 \\quad (\\text{as computed earlier})\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- Now, \\( f^{(8)}(5) = 5 \\). It seems that every four steps, we return to 5.\n- **Check:** Comparing with earlier computations:\n  - \\( f^{(4)}(5) = 5 \\)\n  - \\( f^{(8)}(5) = 5 \\)\n- This suggests that the function has a cycle of 4.\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet's list the sequence to ensure the cycle is consistent:\n\n1. \\( f(5) = 3 \\)\n2. \\( f^{(2)}(5) = 9 \\)\n3. \\( f^{(3)}(5) = 4 \\)\n4. \\( f^{(4)}(5) = 5 \\)\n5. \\( f^{(5)}(5) = 3 \\)\n6. \\( f^{(6)}(5) = 9 \\)\n7. \\( f^{(7)}(5) = 4 \\)\n8. \\( f^{(8)}(5) = 5 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe sequence repeats every four steps: 3, 9, 4, 5. Therefore, the order of 5 with respect to \\( f \\) is indeed **4**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- Before finalizing, let's ensure there are no errors in the computations.\n- Each step correctly follows from the previous one, and the cycle is consistent.\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\n- \\( f(5) = 3 \\) \u2192 \\( 5^2 \\mod 11 = 25 \\mod 11 = 3 \\)\n- \\( f(3) = 9 \\) \u2192 \\( 3^2 \\mod 11 = 9 \\mod 11 = 9 \\)\n- \\( f(9) = 4 \\) \u2192 \\( 9^2 \\mod 11 = 81 \\mod 11 = 4 \\)\n- \\( f(4) = 5 \\) \u2192 \\( 4^2 \\mod 11 = 16 \\mod 11 = 5 \\)\n- The cycle repeats from here.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nEverything checks out. The smallest \\( m \\) such that \\( f^{(m)}(5) = 5 \\) is indeed **4**.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER>The order of 5 with respect to the function \\( f(x) = x^2 \\mod 11 \\) is 4.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:** Direct computation worked well to identify the cycle.\n- **Adjustments Made:** Recognized that stopping at the first return to 5 was insufficient and continued to confirm the complete cycle.\n- **Final Verification:** Ensured consistency in the sequence to validate the order.\n\nBy methodically applying the function and verifying the results, I arrived at the correct order. It's essential to check for complete cycles in such problems to avoid premature conclusions.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>The order of 5 with respect to the function \\( f(x) = x^2 \\mod 11 \\) is 4.</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "By computing the first few $f^{(n)}(5)$, we get \\begin{align*}\nf^{(1)}(5)=f(5) = 3,\\\\\nf^{(2)}(5)=f(f^{(1)}(5))=f(3)=9,\\\\\nf^{(3)}(5)=f(f^{(2)}(5))=f(9)=4,\\\\\nf^{(4)}(5)=f(f^{(3)}(5))=f(4)=5.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the desired order is $\\boxed{4}$."
