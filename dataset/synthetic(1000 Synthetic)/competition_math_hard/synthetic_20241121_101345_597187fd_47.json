  "solution": "Alright, let\u2019s tackle this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would on paper. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so **x** and **y** are always positive. I see that **x\u00b2** and **y** vary inversely. Hmm, inverse variation usually means when one value goes up, the other goes down. The problem gives me that **y** is 10 when **x** is 2, and I need to find **x** when **y** is 4000.\n\n**First Impression:** This looks like an inverse variation problem involving squares. I remember dealing with inverse relationships before, so maybe I can apply those concepts here.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Use Inverse Variation Formula:** I recall that for inverse variations, the product of the two variables remains constant. But here, it's **x\u00b2** and **y** that vary inversely. Maybe I can set up an equation based on that.\n\n2. **Proportional Relationships:** Perhaps I can set up proportions since increasing **y** should affect **x** in a specific way.\n\n3. **Graphical Representation:** Visualizing how **x\u00b2** and **y** relate might help, but it seems more straightforward to stick with algebra.\n\n**Leaning Towards:** The first strategy\u2014using the inverse variation formula\u2014since it directly applies to what's given.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Inverse Variation Formula**\n\nLet's try setting up an inverse variation equation.\n\n**Thought Process:** If **x\u00b2** and **y** vary inversely, then:\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\cdot y = k\n\\]\n\nwhere **k** is a constant.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if this makes sense. If I plug in the given values (**x = 2**, **y = 10**), I should be able to find **k**.\n\n**Reflection:** Yeah, this seems right. By finding **k**, I can then use it to find the new **x** when **y** is 4000.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Constant \\(k\\)**\n\nPlug in the given values:\n\n\\[\nx = 2,\\ y = 10\n\\]\n\nCompute **x\u00b2**:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 2^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nNow, set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\cdot y = k \\implies 4 \\cdot 10 = k \\implies k = 40\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Okay, so **k = 40**. This constant represents the relationship between **x\u00b2** and **y**.\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? If **x\u00b2** increases, **y** should decrease to keep the product constant. Yeah, that aligns with inverse variation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation for the New \\(y\\)**\n\nNow, I need to find **x** when **y = 4000**. Using the constant **k**:\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\cdot y = 40\n\\]\n\nPlug in **y = 4000**:\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\cdot 4000 = 40\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This equation looks correct. Solving for **x\u00b2** should give me the value I need.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\(x\u00b2\\)**\n\nRearrange the equation to solve for **x\u00b2**:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{40}{4000}\n\\]\n\nPerform the division:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{40}{4000} = \\frac{1}{100}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Hmm, so **x\u00b2 = 0.01**. That seems reasonable given the inverse relationship.\n\n**Quick Check:** If **y** increases to 4000 (a large number), **x\u00b2** should decrease significantly to maintain the constant product. **x\u00b2 = 0.01** fits this expectation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving for \\(x\\)**\n\nFinally, take the square root of both sides to find **x**:\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{0.01} = 0.1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Is **x = 0.1** logical? Given that **y** increased massively, **x** decreasing to 0.1 makes sense in an inverse relationship.\n\n**Final Check:** Let's verify. If **x = 0.1**, then:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 0.01,\\ y = 4000\n\\]\n\nCompute the product:\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\cdot y = 0.01 \\cdot 4000 = 40\n\\]\n\nSince the product is still **40**, which matches our constant **k**, the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>\nsolution\n\nx = 0.1\n</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Thoughts:** After walking through the problem step by step, checking each part along the way, and confirming that the final answer maintains the established relationship, I'm confident that **x = 0.1** is the correct solution.\n\n---\n\nThere you have it! By brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting, and consistently checking the work, I've arrived at the correct answer just as I would naturally when solving a problem.",
  "ground_truth": "Since $x^2$ and $y$ are inversely proportional, their product is constant.  Thus $$2^2 \\cdot 10 = x^2 \\cdot 4000 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad x = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}.$$"
