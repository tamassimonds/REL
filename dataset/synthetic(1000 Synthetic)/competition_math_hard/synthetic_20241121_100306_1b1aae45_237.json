  "solution": "Absolutely, let's compile our thought process into a coherent and complete solution, just as if we were working through it step by step. I'll maintain the original approach while ensuring it's clear and logically structured.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nLooking at the series:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{8}{27} - \\frac{32}{243} + \\dots\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \n- This resembles an **infinite geometric series** due to the alternating signs and exponentially increasing denominators.  \n- However, I'm not entirely certain it's geometric right away, so I'll need to verify by checking the common ratio between terms.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Identify the Common Ratio (\\( r \\))**: Check if there's a consistent ratio between successive terms.  \n2. **Confirm Alternating Signs**: Ensure the ratio involves a negative component due to alternating signs.  \n3. **Apply Geometric Series Sum Formula**: If confirmed, use the formula for the sum of an infinite series.  \n4. **Verify Convergence**: Ensure the absolute value of \\( r \\) is less than 1 for convergence.  \n5. **Consider Alternative Series Types**: If not geometric, explore other series types like telescoping or arithmetic.\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying the Common Ratio**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- To determine if the series is geometric, I'll calculate the ratio between successive terms.\n\n**Calculations:**  \n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\text{second term}}{\\text{first term}} = \\frac{-\\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{3}{2}}\n\\]\n\n**Performing the Division:**  \n\\[\nr = -\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = -\\frac{4}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- The ratio between the first and second terms is \\(-\\frac{4}{9}\\).  \n- To confirm consistency, let's check the next pair of terms:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\frac{8}{27}}{-\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{8}{27} \\times -\\frac{3}{2} = -\\frac{24}{54} = -\\frac{4}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n- The ratio remains consistent! This confirms that the series is geometric with a common ratio \\( r = -\\frac{4}{9} \\).\n\n### **Step 2: Understanding the Series Components**\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **First Term (\\( a \\))**: \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\)  \n- **Common Ratio (\\( r \\))**: \\(-\\frac{4}{9}\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- The negative common ratio accounts for the alternating signs in the series.  \n- This aligns with the characteristics of a geometric series.\n\n### **Step 3: Checking for Convergence**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- An infinite geometric series converges if the absolute value of the common ratio is less than 1 (\\(|r| < 1\\)).\n\n\\[\n|r| = \\left| -\\frac{4}{9} \\right| = \\frac{4}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Since \\(\\frac{4}{9} < 1\\), the series **converges**.  \n- This allows us to proceed with calculating the sum using the geometric series formula.\n\n### **Step 4: Applying the Geometric Series Sum Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- The sum \\( S \\) of an infinite geometric series is given by:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\n\\]\n\nWhere:  \n- \\( a \\) is the first term (\\(\\frac{3}{2}\\))  \n- \\( r \\) is the common ratio (\\(-\\frac{4}{9}\\))\n\n**Calculations:**  \n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{1 - \\left(-\\frac{4}{9}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{1 + \\frac{4}{9}}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Denominator:**  \n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{9}{9} + \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{13}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\( S \\):**  \n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{\\frac{13}{9}} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{9}{13} = \\frac{27}{26}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- The sum computes to \\(\\frac{27}{26}\\).  \n- This result seems plausible given the alternating signs and diminishing magnitudes of the terms.\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Calculation with Partial Sums**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- To confirm the correctness, calculating the first few partial sums can help visualize convergence towards \\(\\frac{27}{26}\\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- **First Term:**  \n  \\(\\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\\)\n  \n- **Second Term:**  \n  \\(1.5 - \\frac{2}{3} = 1.5 - 0.6667 \\approx 0.8333\\)\n  \n- **Third Term:**  \n  \\(0.8333 + \\frac{8}{27} = 0.8333 + 0.2963 \\approx 1.1296\\)\n  \n- **Fourth Term:**  \n  \\(1.1296 - \\frac{32}{243} = 1.1296 - 0.1317 \\approx 0.9979\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- The partial sums oscillate and approach around 1, aligning with our calculated sum of \\(\\frac{27}{26} \\approx 1.0385\\).  \n- This consistency reinforces the correctness of our solution.\n\n### **Final Check: Reasonableness of the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Given the series\u2019 properties\u2014alternating signs and decreasing magnitudes\u2014the sum being slightly greater than 1 makes sense.  \n- Each successive term reduces the total sum by a smaller amount, converging towards \\(\\frac{27}{26}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Everything checks out.  \n- The approach and calculations align with the expected behavior of the series.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy methodically:\n\n1. **Identifying the Common Ratio**: Confirming a consistent ratio of \\(-\\frac{4}{9}\\) between terms.  \n2. **Ensuring Convergence**: Verifying that \\(|r| < 1\\), allowing the series to converge.  \n3. **Applying the Sum Formula**: Utilizing the geometric series formula to compute the sum.  \n4. **Verifying with Partial Sums**: Checking partial sums to ensure accuracy.\n\n<ANSWER>\\(\\frac{27}{26}\\)</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Sum:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{27}{26}}\n\\]\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe sum of the infinite geometric series is \\(\\frac{27}{26}\\). By carefully following each step, verifying calculations, and cross-checking through partial sums, we've confidently arrived at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\nI hope this walkthrough captures the essence of problem-solving, reflecting the natural thought process of brainstorming, verifying, and adjusting strategies to ensure correctness.",
