  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it like I would if I were solving it by hand, exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and reflecting on whether my approach is correct. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question is asking for the smallest positive integer with **six positive odd integer divisors** and **twelve positive even integer divisors**.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This seems like a problem involving factors and divisors. I recall that the number of divisors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization of a number.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Prime Factorization Approach:** Determine the prime factorization that leads to the required number of divisors.\n  2. **Using the Divisor Function:** Utilize the formula for the total number of divisors based on exponents.\n  3. **Trial and Error with Small Numbers:** Start with small integers to see which one fits.\n\nLet's think more about these strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Prime Factorization Approach**\n\n- **Thought Process:** If I can determine the prime factorization of the number, I might be able to figure out how many divisors it has, both odd and even.\n\n- **Recalling Concepts:** I remember that the total number of divisors of a number is related to the exponents in its prime factorization. Specifically, if a number \\( n \\) has a prime factorization of \\( p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{e_k} \\), then the total number of divisors is \\( (e_1 + 1) \\times (e_2 + 1) \\times \\ldots \\times (e_k + 1) \\).\n\n- **Realization:** Wait a minute. The problem specifies both odd and even divisors separately. This means the number must have both odd and even factors, implying that it includes both odd and even prime factors.\n\n- **Reflection:** This makes sense because only numbers with at least one even prime factor (i.e., 2) will have even divisors.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Strategy 1**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Let's try to express the number in terms of its prime factors, including both odd and even primes.\n\n- **Assumption:** Suppose the number \\( n \\) has the form \\( 2^a \\times m \\), where \\( m \\) is an odd integer (i.e., \\( m \\) has no factor of 2).\n\n#### **Calculating Odd Divisors:**\n- The odd divisors come solely from the factors of \\( m \\).\n- So, if \\( m \\) has a prime factorization \\( p_1^{b_1} \\times p_2^{b_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{b_k} \\) (all odd primes), then the number of odd divisors is \\( (b_1 + 1) \\times (b_2 + 1) \\times \\ldots \\).\n\n- **Given Condition:** We need **six** odd divisors.\n  - **Conclusion:** Therefore, \\( (b_1 + 1) \\times (b_2 + 1) \\times \\ldots = 6 \\).\n\n#### **Calculating Even Divisors:**\n- The even divisors result from multiplying the factors of \\( m \\) by powers of 2 up to \\( 2^a \\).\n- **Total Number of Divisors:** The total number of divisors of \\( n \\) is the product of the exponents of all primes incremented by one.\n- **Even Divisors:** The even divisors are the total divisors minus the odd divisors.\n\n- **Given Condition:** We need **twelve** even divisors.\n\n#### **Setting Up Equations:**\n- Total number of divisors = Odd divisors + Even divisors = \\( 6 + 12 = 18 \\).\n- Therefore, \\( (a + 1) \\times (b_1 + 1) \\times (b_2 + 1) \\times \\ldots = 18 \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** This approach seems logical. By setting up these equations, I can solve for the exponents \\( a, b_1, b_2, \\ldots \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the Equations**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Let's list possible combinations of exponents that satisfy these conditions.\n\n- **Brainstorming:**\n\n  - **For Odd Divisors:** \n    - \\( (b_1 + 1) \\times (b_2 + 1) \\times \\ldots = 6 \\).\n    - Possible combinations:\n      - \\( 6 = 6 \\times 1 \\)\n      - \\( 6 = 3 \\times 2 \\)\n      - \\( 6 = 2 \\times 3 \\)\n    \n  - **For Total Divisors:** \n    - \\( (a + 1) \\times \\) (product of \\( b_i + 1 \\)) \\( = 18 \\).\n    - So, \\( (a + 1) \\times 6 = 18 \\) \u21d2 \\( a + 1 = 3 \\) \u21d2 \\( a = 2 \\).\n\n- **Realization:**  \n  - **Wait a second:** This means \\( a = 2 \\), so the number must have \\( 2^2 = 4 \\) as a factor.\n  - **Conclusion:** The smallest even prime factor's exponent is 2.\n\n#### **Checking Combinations for Odd Factors:**\n- **Case 1:** \\( b_1 + 1 = 6 \\) \u21d2 \\( b_1 = 5 \\)\n  - This implies \\( m = p_1^5 \\) where \\( p_1 \\) is an odd prime.\n- **Case 2:** \\( b_1 + 1 = 3 \\) and \\( b_2 + 1 = 2 \\) \u21d2 \\( b_1 = 2 \\), \\( b_2 = 1 \\) \n  - This implies \\( m = p_1^2 \\times p_2^1 \\) where \\( p_1 \\) and \\( p_2 \\) are distinct odd primes.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  - **Case 1:** Having \\( m = p_1^5 \\) might lead to a large number.\n  - **Case 2:** Having \\( m = p_1^2 \\times p_2 \\) might yield a smaller number.\n\n- **Preference:** Let's proceed with **Case 2** to potentially find a smaller integer.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Case 2**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  - **Assigning Primes:** Let\u2019s assign the smallest odd primes to \\( p_1 \\) and \\( p_2 \\).\n    - Let \\( p_1 = 3 \\) and \\( p_2 = 5 \\).\n  - **Calculating \\( m \\):** \n    - \\( m = 3^2 \\times 5^1 = 9 \\times 5 = 45 \\).\n  - **Calculating \\( n \\):** \n    - \\( n = 2^a \\times m = 2^2 \\times 45 = 4 \\times 45 = 180 \\).\n\n- **Intermediate Check:** \n  - **Does 180 have six odd divisors and twelve even divisors?** \n  - Let's verify.\n\n#### **Listing Divisors of 180:**\n- **Prime Factorization of 180:** \n  - \\( 180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\).\n- **Total Number of Divisors:** \n  - \\( (2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) \\times (1 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 18 \\).\n- **Odd Divisors:** \n  - Derived from \\( 3^2 \\times 5^1 = 9 \\times 5 = 45 \\).\n  - Number of odd divisors: \\( (2 + 1) \\times (1 + 1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\).\n- **Even Divisors:** \n  - Total divisors - Odd divisors = 18 - 6 = 12.\n\n- **Reflection:** \n  - **Wait, this checks out!** \n  - The number 180 indeed has six odd divisors and twelve even divisors.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  - **It looks like 180 satisfies all the conditions.**\n  - But let me double-check to ensure there's no smaller number that also fits.\n\n---\n\n### **Double-Checking with Case 1**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  - **Alternative Case:** Let's briefly consider **Case 1** where \\( b_1 = 5 \\).\n    - This would mean \\( m = p_1^5 \\).\n  - **Assigning the Smallest Odd Prime:** \n    - Let \\( p_1 = 3 \\).\n    - So, \\( m = 3^5 = 243 \\).\n  - **Calculating \\( n \\):** \n    - \\( n = 2^2 \\times 243 = 4 \\times 243 = 972 \\).\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  - **Realization:** \n    - **Hold on, 972 is much larger than 180.**\n    - **Case 1** leads to a significantly larger number.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  - **Therefore, Case 1 is not optimal.**\n  - **Case 2** yielding 180 is indeed the smallest positive integer satisfying the conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  - **Quick Verification:** Let's quickly verify that no smaller combination of exponents would satisfy the conditions.\n\n- **Alternative Combinations:**  \n  - **Is there a smaller \\( a \\)?** \n    - If \\( a = 1 \\), then \\( a + 1 = 2 \\).\n    - This would require \\( (b_1 + 1) \\times (b_2 + 1) \\times \\ldots = 18 / 2 = 9 \\), which doesn't match our requirement for six odd divisors.\n  - **Is there a smaller \\( b_i \\)?** \n    - Reducing exponents further would violate the condition of having six odd divisors.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  - **Nope, reducing exponents doesn't work.**\n  - **Therefore, \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b_1 = 2 \\), \\( b_2 = 1 \\)** is the optimal combination.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  - **180 is indeed the smallest positive integer satisfying all the conditions.**\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>**\n\n\\(<ANSWER>180\\) solution</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Summary:**  \n  - By exploring different strategies, starting with prime factorization, and considering various combinations of exponents, I determined that 180 is the smallest positive integer with six odd divisors and twelve even divisors.\n\n- **Reflection on Approach:**  \n  - Initial brainstorming helped identify the right path.\n  - Checking multiple cases ensured that no smaller number fits the criteria.\n  - Frequent reflections and checks validated the correctness of the solution.\n\n- **Lessons Learned:**  \n  - Breaking down the problem into smaller parts makes it more manageable.\n  - Verifying each step is crucial to ensure the accuracy of the solution.\n  - Being open to changing strategies helps find the optimal solution efficiently.\n\nThat's it! By thinking through the problem step by step, exploring different strategies, and reflecting along the way, I arrived at the correct answer: **180**.",
  "ground_truth": "We use the fact that the number of divisors of a number $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)$. If a number has $18 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3$ factors, then it can have at most $3$ distinct primes in its factorization.\nDividing the greatest power of $2$ from $n$, we have an odd integer with six positive divisors, which indicates that it either is ($6 = 2 \\cdot 3$) a prime raised to the $5$th power, or two primes, one of which is squared. The smallest example of the former is $3^5 = 243$, while the smallest example of the latter is $3^2 \\cdot 5 = 45$.\nSuppose we now divide all of the odd factors from $n$; then we require a power of $2$ with $\\frac{18}{6} = 3$ factors, namely $2^{3-1} = 4$. Thus, our answer is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{180}$."
