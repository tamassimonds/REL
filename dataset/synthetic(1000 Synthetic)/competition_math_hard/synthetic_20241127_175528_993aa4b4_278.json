  "solution": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect at each step, check for correctness, and adjust my approach as needed. This way, we ensure a natural and thorough problem-solving process.\n\n---\n\n### **First Impressions and Brainstorming**\n\nAlright, looking at the problem:\n\n- **We have a convex quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\)** with given side lengths and an angle:\n  - \\(AB = 8\\), \\(BC = 4\\), \\(CD = DA = 10\\)\n  - \\(\\angle CDA = 60^\\circ\\)\n- **Goal:** Find the area in the form \\(\\sqrt{a} + b\\sqrt{c}\\) and compute \\(a + b + c\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- This looks like a quadrilateral with specific properties: Two sides are equal (\\(CD = DA\\)) and there's a known angle between them, making triangle \\(CDA\\) an **isosceles triangle**.\n- The angle is \\(60^\\circ\\): This reminds me of **equilateral triangles** and possibly using trigonometric identities.\n- Given side lengths and angles: Maybe the **Law of Cosines** or **Heron's formula** could be useful.\n- Area of quadrilateral: Possibly split into triangles and find their areas individually.\n\nBut wait, let's explore multiple strategies to ensure we're on the right track.\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Divide the Quadrilateral into Triangles:**\n   - Split \\(ABCD\\) into two triangles: \\(CDA\\) and \\(ABC\\).\n   - Compute the area of each triangle separately and sum them up.\n\n2. **Use Trigonometry:**\n   - Apply the Law of Cosines to find missing angles or sides.\n   - Use the Law of Sines to find necessary lengths.\n\n3. **Coordinate Geometry:**\n   - Place the quadrilateral on a coordinate plane and use formulas to compute the area.\n\n4. **Vector Approach:**\n   - Use vectors to represent sides and compute the area using cross products.\n\n**Hmm, the first strategy seems the most straightforward**\u2014dividing the quadrilateral into two triangles. Let's start with that, but I'll keep the other strategies in mind in case we need to pivot.\n\n### **Strategy 1: Divide into Triangles \\(CDA\\) and \\(ABC\\)**\n\n#### **Step 1: Find the Area of Triangle \\(CDA\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Triangle \\(CDA\\) is isosceles with \\(\\angle CDA = 60^\\circ\\).\n- Given sides \\(CD = DA = 10\\).\n- This resembles an equilateral triangle, but only two sides are equal.\n- We can use the **formula for the area of a triangle with two sides and the included angle**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times CD \\times DA \\times \\sin(60^\\circ)\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- \\( \\sin(60^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\)\n- Plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{CDA} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 25\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **That was straightforward.** The area of triangle \\(CDA\\) is \\(25\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n#### **Step 2: Find the Area of Triangle \\(ABC\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, we need to find the area of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n- We have sides \\(AB = 8\\) and \\(BC = 4\\), but we need more information.\n- Perhaps we need to find the length of \\(AC\\) or an angle in triangle \\(ABC\\).\n\n**Wait a minute, we don't have enough direct information** about triangle \\(ABC\\). Maybe we need to find the diagonal \\(AC\\) first.\n\n#### **Finding Diagonal \\(AC\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since triangle \\(CDA\\) is isosceles with a known angle, we can use the **Law of Cosines** to find \\(AC\\).\n\n\\[\nAC^2 = CD^2 + DA^2 - 2 \\times CD \\times DA \\times \\cos(60^\\circ)\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- \\(CD = DA = 10\\), and \\(\\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- Plugging in:\n\n\\[\nAC^2 = 10^2 + 10^2 - 2 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 200 - 100 = 100\n\\]\n\n- Therefore, \\(AC = \\sqrt{100} = 10\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Interesting!** \\(AC = 10\\), so triangle \\(CDA\\) is actually **equilateral**. This simplifies things.\n\n#### **Proceeding with Triangle \\(ABC\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now we know \\(AC = 10\\), and we have sides \\(AB = 8\\) and \\(BC = 4\\).\n- We can use **Heron's formula** to find the area of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n- But first, let's check if triangle \\(ABC\\) is right-angled or has any special properties.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Using the **Pythagorean theorem**: \n  - \\(AB^2 + BC^2 = 8^2 + 4^2 = 64 + 16 = 80\\)\n  - \\(AC^2 = 10^2 = 100\\)\n- Since \\(AB^2 + BC^2 \\neq AC^2\\), triangle \\(ABC\\) is not right-angled.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **No special right angle here,** so Heron's formula is a good approach.\n\n#### **Using Heron's Formula**\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Compute the semi-perimeter \\(s\\):**\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \\frac{8 + 4 + 10}{2} = 11\n\\]\n\n2. **Calculate the area \\(A\\):**\n\n\\[\nA = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)} = \\sqrt{11(11 - 8)(11 - 4)(11 - 10)} = \\sqrt{11 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 1} = \\sqrt{231}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **The area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is \\(\\sqrt{231}\\).** That seems reasonable.\n\n#### **Step 3: Compute the Total Area of Quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Add the areas of triangles \\(CDA\\) and \\(ABC\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Area} = \\text{Area}_{CDA} + \\text{Area}_{ABC} = 25\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{231}\n\\]\n\n- This matches the required form \\(\\sqrt{a} + b\\sqrt{c}\\):\n  - \\(a = 231\\)\n  - \\(b = 25\\), \\(c = 3\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait, the problem asks for \\(a + b + c\\),** but let's double-check if \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) have no perfect square factors greater than 1.\n\n#### **Final Check: Simplifying \\(\\sqrt{231}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Factorize 231 to see if it can be simplified:\n  - \\(231 = 3 \\times 77 = 3 \\times 7 \\times 11\\)\n  - **No perfect squares greater than 1,** so \\(\\sqrt{231}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Everything checks out.** The final expression is in the correct form.\n\n#### **Compute \\(a + b + c\\):**\n\n\\[\na + b + c = 231 + 25 + 3 = 259\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>259 solution</ANSWER>**\n\nThe value of \\(a + b + c\\) is **259**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully dividing the quadrilateral into two triangles and calculating their areas separately, we arrived at the correct solution. Along the way, we used:\n\n- **Law of Cosines** to find the diagonal \\(AC\\).\n- **Heron's Formula** to compute the area of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n- **Simple addition** to combine the areas of the two triangles.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with constant reflections and checks, ensured that our solution was both accurate and efficient.",

To find the height of this triangle, we drop a perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$ and label the intersection point $E$: [asy]\npair A,B,C,E;\nA=(0,5*sqrt(3));\nB=(10-13/5,5*sqrt(3)+(1/5)*sqrt(231));\nC=(10,5*sqrt(3));\nE=(10-13/5,5*sqrt(3));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW); label(\"$B$\",B,N); label(\"$C$\",C,SE); label(\"$E$\",E,S);\ndraw(B--E,dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$8$\",(A--B),NW); label(\"$4$\",(B--C),NE);\n\n[/asy] Let $BE=h$, $CE=x$, and $EA=10-x$.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle BCE$ yields \\[x^2+h^2=16\\]and on $\\triangle ABE$ yields \\[(10-x)^2+h^2=64.\\]Expanding the second equation yields $x^2-20x+100+h^2=64$; substituting $16$ for $x^2+h^2$ yields $16+100-20x=64$.  Solving yields $x=\\frac{13}{5}$ and $h=\\sqrt{16-x^2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{231}}{5}$.  It follows that \\[[\\triangle ABC]= \\frac{1}{2}(BE)(AC)=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{231}}{5}\\cdot 10 = \\sqrt{231}.\\]Finally, \\[[ABCD]=[\\triangle ADC]+[\\triangle ABC]=25\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{231}=\\sqrt{a}+b\\sqrt{c}.\\]Thus we see $a=231$, $b=25$, and $c=3$, so $a+b+c=\\boxed{259}$."
