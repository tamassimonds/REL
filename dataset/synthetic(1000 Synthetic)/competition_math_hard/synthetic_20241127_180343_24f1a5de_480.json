  "solution": "Certainly! Let's craft a coherent and complete solution by integrating all the brainstorming, checks, and reflections from the working out. I'll maintain the original thought process, ensuring it reads naturally and thoroughly explores different strategies without altering the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- We have a quadratic equation: \\(2x^2 - mx + n = 0\\).\n- The roots sum to 6 and multiply to 10.\n- Our goal is to find \\(m + n\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This reminds me of **Vieta\u2019s formulas**, which connect the coefficients of a polynomial to the sums and products of its roots.\n- But wait, maybe there's another way\u2014like factoring the quadratic or using the quadratic formula. It's always good to consider multiple approaches.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Vieta\u2019s Formulas:** Directly use the given sums and products of roots.\n2. **Factoring the Quadratic:** Express the quadratic in terms of its roots and expand.\n3. **Quadratic Formula:** Utilize the formula to relate coefficients to sums and products.\n\nI'll start with **Vieta\u2019s formulas** since they seem straightforward, but I'll keep the other methods in mind as checks.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Vieta\u2019s Formulas**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- According to **Vieta\u2019s Theorems** for a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\):\n  - Sum of roots (\\(r_1 + r_2\\)) = \\(-\\frac{b}{a}\\)\n  - Product of roots (\\(r_1 \\cdot r_2\\)) = \\(\\frac{c}{a}\\)\n- Our equation is \\(2x^2 - mx + n = 0\\), so:\n  - \\(a = 2\\)\n  - \\(b = -m\\)\n  - \\(c = n\\)\n\n**Setting Up Equations:**\n- **Sum of Roots:**\n  \\[\n  r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{-m}{2} = \\frac{m}{2} = 6\n  \\]\n- **Product of Roots:**\n  \\[\n  r_1 \\cdot r_2 = \\frac{n}{2} = 10\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Does this setup make sense? Yes, by rearranging Vieta\u2019s formulas, we've correctly related \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) to the given sums and products.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving for \\(m\\) and \\(n\\)**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Sum Equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{m}{2} = 6 \\implies m = 6 \\times 2 = 12\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Product Equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n}{2} = 10 \\implies n = 10 \\times 2 = 20\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- That was straightforward. But let's pause\u2014does this make sense?\n- Given the roots sum to 6 and multiply to 10, and we've accounted for the coefficient 2 in front of \\(x^2\\), it seems correct.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Adding \\(m\\) and \\(n\\): \n  \\[\n  m + n = 12 + 20 = 32\n  \\]\n- Does \\(32\\) feel right? Based on the calculations, yes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying with an Alternative Approach (Factoring the Quadratic)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let\u2019s say I didn\u2019t start with Vieta\u2019s and wanted to factor the quadratic instead.\n- Given the sum and product of roots, the quadratic can be expressed as:\n  \\[\n  a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\n  \\]\n- Expanding this should lead us back to the original equation.\n\n**Expanding the Factored Form:**\n\\[\n2(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 2(x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1 r_2) \n\\]\n\\[\n= 2x^2 - 2(r_1 + r_2)x + 2r_1 r_2\n\\]\n\n**Comparing with Original Equation:**\n- Our original equation is \\(2x^2 - mx + n = 0\\).\n- Therefore:\n  \\[\n  m = 2(r_1 + r_2) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = 2(r_1 r_2)\n  \\]\n\n**Plugging in Given Values:**\n- \\(r_1 + r_2 = 6\\) \u21d2 \n  \\[\n  m = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n  \\]\n- \\(r_1 r_2 = 10\\) \u21d2 \n  \\[\n  n = 2 \\times 10 = 20\n  \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- This matches our previous solution. It\u2019s always good to verify using a different method!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**User Inquiry:**\n- \"Are you sure \\(m + n = 32\\) is correct?\"\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let\u2019s double-check by considering the quadratic formula to ensure consistency.\n\n**Using the Quadratic Formula:**\n- The roots are given by:\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n  \\]\n- For our equation: \n  \\[\n  a = 2, \\quad b = -m, \\quad c = n\n  \\]\n  \n**Rewriting the Sum and Product:**\n- However, since we already used Vieta\u2019s formulas which are derived from the quadratic formula, this step essentially reiterates our previous calculations.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n- Reconfirming:\n  \\[\n  m = 12 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = 20\n  \\]\n- Therefore:\n  \\[\n  m + n = 12 + 20 = 32\n  \\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n- All methods agree. The value of \\(m + n\\) is indeed 32.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{32}\n\\]\n\n**Closing Thoughts:**\n- By exploring multiple strategies\u2014**Vieta\u2019s formulas** and **factoring**\u2014we ensured the correctness of our solution.\n- Regularly checking each step helped confirm the accuracy and catch any potential errors early.\n- Verifying the result with different methods strengthens confidence in the final answer.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Vieta's Formulas** provided a straightforward path to find \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).\n- **Factoring the Quadratic** served as a reliable verification method.\n- Consistent results across multiple approaches validated the solution, leading us confidently to \\(m + n = 32\\).\n\n<ANSWER>solution\n\\[\n\\boxed{32}\n\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nBy thoughtfully integrating various problem-solving strategies and maintaining a reflective approach throughout, we've crafted a robust and complete solution that confirms \\(m + n = 32\\).",
  "ground_truth": "In the quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$, the roots sum to $\\frac{-b}{a}$ and multiply to $\\frac{c}{a}$. Therefore, in the equation $2x^2-mx+n=0$, the roots sum to $\\frac{m}{2}=6$ and multiply to $\\frac{n}{2}=10$. Solving the first equation, we see that $m=12$ and solving the second equation, we see that $n=20$. Therefore, $m+n=12+20=\\boxed{32}$."
