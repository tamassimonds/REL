  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into this question and refine my approach to create a coherent and complete solution. I'll keep my original strategies and reflections, ensuring that I maintain a natural problem-solving flow while making necessary adjustments to enhance clarity. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- So, we have a set of dominoes where each tile consists of two squares with integers from 0 to 9. Each unique pair of numbers is used exactly once. A \"double\" is a domino where both squares have the same number, like (3,3). The goal is to find the probability that a randomly selected domino is a double, expressed as a common fraction.\n\n- Hmm, this sounds like a probability problem where I need to determine the ratio of doubles to the total number of dominoes. But I'm not entirely sure how the complete set is structured. I think I'll need to figure out how many total dominoes there are and how many of those are doubles.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Number of Dominoes:**\n   - Maybe I can list out all possible dominoes to see how many there are in total.\n   \n2. **Determine Number of Doubles:**\n   - I can also think about how many doubles exist since each number from 0 to 9 can pair with itself.\n\n3. **Find the Probability:**\n   - Once I have both totals, I can calculate the probability as the ratio of doubles to the total number of dominoes.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This approach seems logical, but listing out all dominoes manually might be tedious. Perhaps there's a mathematical way to compute the total without listing them all. Let's explore this further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Total Number of Dominoes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the total number of dominoes, I need to consider all unique pairs of numbers from 0 to 9. Each domino is a pair of numbers, and order doesn't matter (i.e., (3,5) is the same as (5,3)).\n\n- This reminds me of combinations, where I need to select two numbers out of ten without regard to order.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- The number of ways to choose two distinct numbers from 0 to 9 is given by the combination formula:\n\n  \\[\n  \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45\n  \\]\n\n- But wait, each number can also pair with itself to form a double. So, there are 10 additional dominoes where both numbers are the same (0,0), (1,1), ..., (9,9).\n\n- Adding these doubles to the distinct pairs, the total number of dominoes is:\n\n  \\[\n  45 \\text{ (distinct pairs)} + 10 \\text{ (doubles)} = 55\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Does this make sense? Each unique pair is counted once, and doubles are added separately. Yeah, that seems right.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- So, the total number of dominoes in the set is 55. This includes all unique pairs and doubles.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Number of Doubles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, I need to find out how many of these dominoes are doubles. A double is a domino where both numbers are the same.\n\n- There are 10 numbers (0 to 9), and each can form a double with itself.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Therefore, there are 10 doubles:\n\n  \\[\n  (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), \\ldots, (9,9)\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Is this correct? Each number has exactly one double, so 10 doubles in total. Yes, that makes sense.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Having 10 doubles out of the total 55 dominoes seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- With the total number of dominoes and the number of doubles known, I can now calculate the probability.\n\n- Probability is defined as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{double}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of Doubles}}{\\text{Total Number of Dominoes}}\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Plugging in the numbers:\n\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{double}) = \\frac{10}{55}\n  \\]\n\n- This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 5:\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{10 \\div 5}{55 \\div 5} = \\frac{2}{11}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Let me double-check the simplification:\n\n  \\[\n  10 \\div 5 = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 55 \\div 5 = 11\n  \\]\n\n- So, \\(\\frac{2}{11}\\) is indeed the simplified fraction.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The probability of selecting a double is \\(\\frac{2}{11}\\). This seems plausible given the numbers involved.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Validating the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let me brainstorm another strategy to ensure the answer is correct. Perhaps thinking about it from a different angle could help verify the result.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\n1. **Listing All Dominoes:**\n   - If I list all possible dominoes, I can count the doubles directly and compare.\n\n2. **Using Symmetry:**\n   - Since each number pairs with itself once, and each unique pair appears once, the ratio should remain the same.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1. **Listing All Dominoes:**\n\n   - List all pairs where the first number is less than or equal to the second to avoid duplicates:\n\n     \\[\n     (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), \\ldots, (0,9)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (1,1), (1,2), \\ldots, (1,9)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\ldots\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (9,9)\n     \\]\n\n   - Counting these, there are 55 dominoes in total, including 10 doubles.\n\n2. **Using Symmetry:**\n\n   - Each of the 10 numbers has exactly one double.\n\n   - The total number of unique pairs (including doubles) is 55.\n\n   - Therefore, the probability remains \n\n\\(\\frac{10}{55} = \\frac{2}{11}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Both methods lead to the same probability, reinforcing that \n\\(\\frac{2}{11}\\)\n\nis indeed correct.\n\n### **Final Check: Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Before finalizing the answer, let's consider whether \n\\(\\frac{2}{11}\\)\n\nis a reasonable probability.\n\n- Out of 55 dominoes, 10 are doubles. Simplifying \n\\(\\frac{10}{55}\\)\n\ngives \n\\(\\frac{2}{11}\\),\n\nwhich means approximately 18.18% of the dominoes are doubles.\n\n- This percentage seems realistic, as doubles are less common than mixed pairs.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- No errors were encountered during the calculations. The approach and simplification are correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Everything checks out. The probability is consistent with the number of doubles relative to the total number of dominoes.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>solution\u00a0\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected domino is a double is \n\\(\\frac{2}{11}\\).\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Using a Different Method to Validate**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let me brainstorm another strategy to ensure the answer is correct.

  "ground_truth": "To obtain this probability, we want to take the number of double pairings over the total number of pairings. Because each integer is paired with each other integer exactly once, we must be careful when counting how many integer pairings there are. That is, $0$ can be paired with $10$ other numbers, $1$ can be paired with $9$ other numbers (not $0$, because we've already paired $0$ and $1$), $2$ can be paired with $8$ other numbers, etc. So, there are $10 + 9 + \\ldots + 1 = 55$ pairings. Ten of these pairings are doubles ($00$, $11$, etc.). Thus, the probability of choosing a double is $\\frac{10}{55}$, which simplifies to $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{11}}$."
