  "problem": "Two cross sections of a right hexagonal pyramid are obtained by cutting the pyramid with planes parallel to the hexagonal base. The areas of the cross sections are $216\\sqrt{3}$ square feet and $486\\sqrt{3}$ square feet. The two planes are $8$ feet apart. How far from the apex of the pyramid is the larger cross section, in feet?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem like I would naturally\u2014thinking it through step by step, exploring different strategies, and reflecting as I go. I'll start by brainstorming and letting my initial thoughts flow.\n\n---\n\n### Brainstorming and First Thoughts\n\nWhen I first read the question, I recognize that it's about a right hexagonal pyramid with cross sections parallel to its base. The areas of these cross sections are given, and I need to find the distance from the apex to the larger cross section.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving similar figures, where areas and lengths are related through ratios. But I'm not entirely sure how to apply it yet.\n  \n- **Different Strategies:** I could try using the concept of similar triangles or similar hexagons. Maybe setting up a proportion between the areas and the distances might work. Alternatively, I could think about volume ratios, but since only areas are given, that might not be as straightforward.\n\n- **Exploring Similar Figures:** Since the cross sections are parallel to the base, they should be similar hexagons. This might mean that their side lengths are proportional to their distances from the apex.\n\n**Realization:** Yeah, similar figures seem like the right path because the areas are proportional to the squares of their corresponding lengths.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Relationship Between Areas and Distances\n\nWait, let me think about this. If the cross sections are similar hexagons, then their areas are proportional to the square of their side lengths.\n\n- **Thought Process:** So, if I can relate the areas to the distances from the apex, I can set up a proportion. But how exactly do I connect the areas to the distances?\n\n- **Reflection:** Maybe I need to express the areas in terms of the side lengths and relate those to the distances from the apex.\n\n- **Idea:** Let's say the side length of the hexagon at a certain distance is proportional to that distance. Therefore, the area, being dependent on the square of the side length, should be proportional to the square of the distance.\n\n**First Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because area scales with the square of linear dimensions.\n\n### Step 2: Setting Up the Proportion\n\nAlright, so I need to set up a proportion between the areas and the squares of the distances from the apex.\n\n- **Assumption:** Let\u2019s assume that the distance from the apex to the base is \\( D \\). The larger cross section is at a distance \\( x \\) from the apex, and the smaller one is \\( x - 8 \\) feet away since the planes are 8 feet apart.\n\n- **Proportion Setup:** \n  \\[\n  \\frac{{\\text{Area}_1}}{{\\text{Area}_2}} = \\left( \\frac{{d_1}}{{d_2}} \\right)^2\n  \\]\n  But wait, I need to relate this to \\( x \\).\n\n- **Rewriting the Proportion:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{{216\\sqrt{3}}}{{486\\sqrt{3}}} = \\left( \\frac{{x - 8}}{x} \\right)^2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying the Ratios:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{{216}}{{486}} = \\left( \\frac{{x - 8}}{x} \\right)^2\n  \\]\n  \n**Simplifying Further:** \n\\[\n\\frac{{216}}{{486}} = \\frac{{4}}{{9}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Does this ratio make sense? Yes, because \\( 216/486 \\) simplifies to \\( 4/9 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Solving the Proportion for \\( x \\)\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( x \\) using the proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{{4}}{{9}} = \\left( \\frac{{x - 8}}{x} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\n- **Taking the Square Root on Both Sides:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{{2}}{{3}} = \\frac{{x - 8}}{x}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Cross Multiplying to Solve for \\( x \\):**\n  \\[\n  2x = 3(x - 8)\n  \\]\n  \n  Expanding:\n  \\[\n  2x = 3x - 24\n  \\]\n  \n  Rearranging:\n  \\[\n  2x - 3x = -24 \\\\\n  -x = -24 \\\\\n  x = 24\n  \\]\n  \n**First Check:** Does \\( x = 24 \\) make sense? Given that the two cross sections are 8 feet apart, and \\( x \\) represents the distance to the larger cross section, this seems reasonable.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Solution\n\nLet me double-check my work to ensure everything is correct.\n\n- **Recapping the Proportion:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{{\\text{Area of smaller hexagon}}}{{\\text{Area of larger hexagon}}} = \\left( \\frac{{\\text{Distance to smaller hexagon}}}{{\\text{Distance to larger hexagon}}} \\right)^2\n  \\]\n  \n  Plugging in the values:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{{216\\sqrt{3}}}{{486\\sqrt{3}}} = \\left( \\frac{{16}}{{24}} \\right)^2\n  \\]\n  \n  Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{{4}}{{9}} = \\frac{{4}}{{9}}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** The left and right sides of the equation match, confirming that \\( x = 24 \\) is indeed correct.\n\n### Final Thoughts and Conclusion\n\nThis problem initially seemed challenging, but by recognizing the relationship between similar figures and their areas, I set up a proportion that led to the solution. It's essential to brainstorm different approaches, verify each step, and remain flexible in adjusting strategies to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe larger cross section is **24 feet** from the apex.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps!

  "ground_truth": "The ratio of the areas of the cross sections is equal to $\\frac{216\\sqrt{3}}{486\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac 49$. Since the ratio of the area of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides, it follows that the ratio of the corresponding sides of the cross-sections is equal to $\\sqrt{\\frac 49} = \\frac 23$.\n\nNow consider the right triangles formed by the apex of the pyramid, the foot of the altitude from the apex to the cross section, and a vertex of the hexagon. It follows that these two right triangles will be similar, since they share an angle at the apex. The ratio of their legs in the cross-section is $2/3$, so it follows that the heights of the right triangles are in the same ratio. Suppose that the larger cross section is $h$ feet away from the apex; then $h - \\frac{2}{3} h = 8$, so $\\frac h3 = 8 \\Longrightarrow h = \\boxed{24}$ feet."
