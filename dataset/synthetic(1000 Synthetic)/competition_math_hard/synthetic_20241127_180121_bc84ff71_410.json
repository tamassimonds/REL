  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were solving it naturally. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check each step for correctness, and make adjustments along the way. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this question, it reminds me of transformations in the complex plane, specifically involving linear functions. The function \\( f(z) = (a + bi)z \\) is a complex multiplication, which I know can affect both the magnitude and direction (rotation) of \\( z \\).\n\nThe condition that \\( f(z) \\) is equidistant from both \\( z \\) and the origin is intriguing. It suggests some geometric properties, possibly involving midpoints or angles. Given that \\( |a + bi| = 8 \\), I recognize that \\( a + bi \\) is a complex number with a magnitude of 8, which might relate to scaling factors.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to proceed straight away. Let's brainstorm a few strategies to see which might work.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Geometric Interpretation:** Maybe visualize what's happening in the complex plane. If \\( f(z) \\) is equidistant from \\( z \\) and the origin, perhaps this forms some kind of circle or line.\n\n2. **Algebraic Approach:** Set up equations based on the given conditions. Use the properties of complex numbers and distances to derive relationships between \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( z \\).\n\n3. **Vector Analysis:** Treat complex numbers as vectors and analyze their components to find necessary conditions.\n\n4. **Use of Midpoints or Bisectors:** Since equidistance is mentioned, perhaps the midpoint or angle bisector plays a role.\n\nHmm, the **geometric interpretation** seems promising, but I think starting with the **algebraic approach** might provide a clearer path. Let's give it a shot.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation**\n\nI'll begin by expressing the condition that \\( f(z) \\) is equidistant from both \\( z \\) and the origin. Mathematically, this means:\n\n\\[\n|f(z) - z| = |f(z) - 0| = |f(z)|\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( f(z) = (a + bi)z \\), let's write it out:\n\n\\[\n|(a + bi)z - z| = |(a + bi)z|\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\( z \\) from the left side:\n\n\\[\n|((a + bi) - 1)z| = |(a + bi)z|\n\\]\n\nAlright, so we have:\n\n\\[\n|(a + bi - 1)z| = |(a + bi)z|\n\\]\n\nNow, since \\( z \\neq 0 \\) (otherwise, the distances would trivially be zero), we can divide both sides by \\( |z| \\):\n\n\\[\n|a + bi - 1| = |a + bi|\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n\nWait a minute, this simplifies things significantly! It tells us that the magnitude of \\( a + bi - 1 \\) is equal to the magnitude of \\( a + bi \\). Let's reflect on what this means.\n\nGeometrically, this implies that the complex number \\( a + bi - 1 \\) lies on a circle centered at the origin with radius \\( |a + bi| = 8 \\). \n\nBut wait, let's think deeper. If two complex numbers have the same magnitude, their real and imaginary parts must satisfy certain relationships. This might lead us to find \\( b^2 \\).\n\nDoes this make sense? I think it does, but let's proceed cautiously and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expanding the Magnitudes**\n\nLet's expand both sides to get a clearer picture.\n\nFirst, compute \\( a + bi - 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n(a + bi) - 1 = (a - 1) + bi\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n|(a - 1) + bi| = |a + bi|\n\\]\n\nNow, let's write out the magnitudes:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(a - 1)^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\n\nOkay, squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n\\[\n(a - 1)^2 + b^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplifying the Equation**\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[\n(a - 1)^2 = a^2 - 2a + 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\na^2 - 2a + 1 + b^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( a^2 + b^2 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-2a + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nWait, this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2a = 1 \\implies a = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n\nInteresting! We've found that \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\). Let's pause and reflect on whether this makes sense.\n\nGiven that \\( |a + bi| = 8 \\), and we've found \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\), we can use this to find \\( b \\). But does \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\) align with the magnitude condition?\n\nLet's check.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying with Magnitude Condition**\n\nWe know that:\n\n\\[\n|a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 8\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + b^2} = 8\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + b^2} = 8\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} + b^2 = 64\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\nb^2 = 64 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{256}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{255}{4}\n\\]\n\nSo, we've found:\n\n\\[\nb^2 = \\frac{255}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n\nWait, let\u2019s double-check this calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Calculation**\n\nLet's break it down again to be sure:\n\n1. \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n2. \\( a^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n3. \\( \\frac{1}{4} + b^2 = 64 \\)\n4. Subtract \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) from 64:\n   \\[\n   64 = \\frac{256}{4} \\implies \\frac{256}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{255}{4}\n   \\]\n5. Therefore, \\( b^2 = \\frac{255}{4} \\)\n\nYeah, it looks correct. Alright, let's proceed to finalize the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully working through the problem and verifying each step, we find that:\n\n\\[\nb^2 = \\frac{255}{4}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy setting up the condition that \\( f(z) \\) is equidistant from both \\( z \\) and the origin, we derived a simple relationship between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). This led us to determine that \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\) and subsequently found \\( b^2 = \\frac{255}{4} \\).\n\nThroughout the process, I made sure to reflect and verify the correctness of the approach, ensuring that the solution aligns with the given conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nLooking back, starting with the algebraic approach was the right choice. It allowed us to set up a clear equation based on the given conditions, leading directly to the relationship between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). The key insight was recognizing that the magnitudes being equal simplified the problem significantly.\n\nBy continuously checking each step and reflecting on whether the results made sense, we ensured the accuracy of the solution. This methodical approach is crucial in problem-solving, allowing us to catch and correct any potential errors along the way.\n\n---\n\nThat's how I would naturally work through this problem, incorporating brainstorming, step-by-step exploration, reflection, and verification to arrive at the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "From the given property,\n\\[|f(z) - z| = |f(z)|.\\]Then\n\\[|(a + bi) z - z| = |(a + bi)z|,\\]so $|a + bi - 1||z| = |a + bi||z|.$  Since this holds for all complex numbers $z,$\n\\[|a + bi - 1| = |a + bi| = 8.\\]Then $(a - 1)^2 + b^2 = 64$ and $a^2 + b^2 = 64.$  Subtracting these equations, we get $2a - 1 = 0,$ so $a = \\frac{1}{2}.$  Hence,\n\\[b^2 = 64 - a^2 = 64 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{255}{4}}.\\]"
