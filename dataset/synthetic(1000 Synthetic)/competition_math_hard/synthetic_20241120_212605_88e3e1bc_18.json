    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, simulating a real human thought process, complete with brainstorming, checking for correctness, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nOkay, the problem is about selecting a number from 1 to 150 and determining the probability that it's **not** a perfect power. Perfect powers are numbers that can be expressed as \\( x^y \\) where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers, and \\( y \\geq 2 \\). \n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n\n1. **List All Perfect Powers Up to 150:** We could list all the perfect powers within this range and then subtract that count from 150 to find the numbers that are not perfect powers.\n\n2. **Calculate Probability Directly:** Find the ratio of numbers that are not perfect powers to the total numbers (150).\n\n3. **Alternative Methods:** Maybe there's a formula or shortcut for counting perfect powers that could save time.\n\nI'm leaning towards the first idea\u2014listing all perfect powers up to 150\u2014as it seems straightforward, though it might be time-consuming. But before committing, let me think if this is practical.\n\n### **Exploring the First Strategy: Listing Perfect Powers**\n\n**Step 1: Identify Possible Exponents (\\( y \\))**\n\nSince we're looking for numbers up to 150, let's consider different values of \\( y \\) starting from 2, since \\( y = 1 \\) would just give us the numbers themselves, which isn't a perfect power by definition.\n\n**Possible \\( y \\) values:** 2, 3, 4, etc.\n\nBut wait\u2014higher exponents will quickly exceed 150 even for small bases. Let me see up to which exponent it's practical to consider.\n\n- \\( x^2 \\) (squares)\n- \\( x^3 \\) (cubes)\n- \\( x^4 \\) (fourth powers)\n- Maybe \\( x^5 \\), but beyond that, it might exceed 150 for most \\( x \\).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Perfect Powers for Each \\( y \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s start with \\( y = 2 \\) (squares):\n\n- \\( 1^2 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n- Continue up until \\( x^2 \\leq 150 \\)\n\n**Let me list them:**\n\n\\[ \n1^2 = 1,\\ 2^2 = 4,\\ 3^2 = 9,\\ 4^2 = 16,\\ 5^2 = 25,\\ 6^2 = 36,\\ 7^2 = 49,\\ 8^2 = 64,\\ 9^2 = 81,\\ 10^2 = 100,\\ 11^2 = 121,\\ 12^2 = 144\n\\]\n\nThat gives us **12 perfect squares**.\n\nNext, \\( y = 3 \\) (cubes):\n\n\\[\n1^3 = 1,\\ 2^3 = 8,\\ 3^3 = 27,\\ 4^3 = 64,\\ 5^3 = 125\n\\]\n\nThat\u2019s **5 perfect cubes**.\n\nChecking \\( y = 4 \\) (fourth powers):\n\n\\[\n1^4 = 1,\\ 2^4 = 16,\\ 3^4 = 81\n\\]\n\nThat's **3 fourth powers**.\n\nWhat about \\( y = 5 \\)?\n\n\\[\n1^5 = 1,\\ 2^5 = 32,\\ 3^5 = 243 \\ (which\\ is\\ greater\\ than\\ 150)\n\\]\n\nSo, only **2 perfect fifth powers** within our range.\n\nHigher exponents likely yield numbers exceeding 150, so I\u2019ll stop here.\n\n### **Reflection: Does This Approach Work?**\n\nWait a second\u2014if I list all perfect powers like this, some numbers might repeat. For example, \\( 1 = 1^2 = 1^3 = 1^4 \\), and \\( 16 = 4^2 = 2^4 \\). I need to account for duplicates to avoid overcounting.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:** Maybe instead of listing them separately, I should create a set of unique perfect powers.\n\n### **Adjusting Strategy: Creating a Set of Unique Perfect Powers**\n\nLet\u2019s rethink this. I\u2019ll use a set to store perfect powers up to 150 to ensure each number is counted only once.\n\n**Step 1: Initialize an Empty Set**\n\nI'll call it `perfect_powers`.\n\n**Step 2: Iterate Over Bases (\\( x \\)) and Exponents (\\( y \\))**\n\nFor each \\( x \\), starting from 2 (since \\( 1^y = 1 \\) for any \\( y \\)), and for each \\( y \\) starting from 2, compute \\( x^y \\) and add it to the set if \\( x^y \\leq 150 \\).\n\n**Writing it Out:**\n\nLet me write down the process.\n\n\\[\n\\text{perfect\\_powers} = \\{\\}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( x = 2 \\):\n\\[\n2^2 = 4,\\ 2^3 = 8,\\ 2^4 = 16,\\ 2^5 = 32,\\ 2^6 = 64,\\ 2^7 = 128\n\\]\n(All less than 150\u2014add them to the set.)\n\nFor \\( x = 3 \\):\n\\[\n3^2 = 9,\\ 3^3 = 27,\\ 3^4 = 81,\\ 3^5 = 243\\ (exceeds\\ 150,\\ stop\\ here)\n\\]\n\nFor \\( x = 4 \\):\n\\[\n4^2 = 16,\\ 4^3 = 64,\\ 4^4 = 256\\ (exceeds\\ 150,\\ stop\\ here)\n\\]\n\nContinue this process up to a reasonable \\( x \\).\n\nBut wait\u2014higher bases will exceed 150 even for small exponents. Let me attempt listing a few more:\n\nFor \\( x = 5 \\):\n\\[\n5^2 = 25,\\ 5^3 = 125,\\ 5^4 = 625\\ (exceeds\\ 150,\\ stop\\ here)\n\\]\n\nFor \\( x = 6 \\):\n\\[\n6^2 = 36,\\ 6^3 = 216\\ (exceeds\\ 150,\\ stop\\ here)\n\\]\n\nAt this point, I realize that for \\( x \\geq 6 \\), even \\( x^3 \\) exceeds 150, so it might be unnecessary to go further.\n\n**Step 3: Compile the Set**\n\nNow, let's compile the unique perfect powers we've identified:\n\n\\[\n\\{1,\\ 4,\\ 8,\\ 9,\\ 16,\\ 25,\\ 27,\\ 32,\\ 36,\\ 49,\\ 64,\\ 81,\\ 100,\\ 121,\\ 125,\\ 128,\\ 144\\}\n\\]\n\n**Counting Them:**\nThat\u2019s **17 unique perfect powers**.\n\n**But wait\u2014did I miss any?**\n\nLet\u2019s double-check by considering each \\( x \\) up to where \\( x^2 \\leq 150 \\):\n\n- \\( x = 7: 49 \\)\n- \\( x = 8: 64 \\)\n- \\( x = 9: 81 \\)\n- \\( x = 10: 100 \\)\n- \\( x = 11: 121 \\)\n- \\( x = 12: 144 \\)\n- \\( x = 13: 169\\ (exceeds\\ 150) \\)\n\nSeems like all relevant perfect squares and cubes are accounted for.\n\n### **Reflection: Is the Set Complete?**\n\nI think I've captured all unique perfect powers up to 150. To be sure, let\u2019s consider if there\u2019s a better way to ensure completeness.\n\n**Alternative Check:**\n\nMaybe I can list the perfect squares and cubes separately and then merge them into a set to avoid duplicates.\n\n**Listing Perfect Squares:**\n\n\\[\n1^2 = 1,\\ 2^2 = 4,\\ 3^2 = 9,\\ 4^2 = 16,\\ 5^2 = 25,\\ 6^2 = 36,\\ 7^2 = 49,\\ 8^2 = 64,\\ 9^2 = 81,\\ 10^2 = 100,\\ 11^2 = 121,\\ 12^2 = 144\n\\]\n(That\u2019s 12 perfect squares.)\n\n**Listing Perfect Cubes:**\n\n\\[\n1^3 = 1,\\ 2^3 = 8,\\ 3^3 = 27,\\ 4^3 = 64,\\ 5^3 = 125\n\\]\n(That\u2019s 5 perfect cubes.)\n\n**Listing Higher Exponents:**\n\nFor \\( y = 4 \\):\n\\[\n2^4 = 16,\\ 3^4 = 81\n\\]\n(That\u2019s 2 fourth powers.)\n\nPutting them all in a set to remove duplicates:\n\n\\[\n\\{1,\\ 4,\\ 8,\\ 9,\\ 16,\\ 25,\\ 27,\\ 32,\\ 36,\\ 49,\\ 64,\\ 81,\\ 100,\\ 121,\\ 125,\\ 128,\\ 144\\}\n\\]\n\n**Final Count:**\n17 unique perfect powers.\n\n### **Second Thoughts: Does This Make Sense?**\n\nHmm, initially, I thought there were fewer perfect powers, but the set confirms 17 unique ones. It seems correct, but let me check if there\u2019s a pattern or a better way to verify.\n\nMaybe calculating the number of perfect powers differently could help.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Counting Non-Perfect Powers Directly**\n\nPerhaps instead of counting perfect powers, I could find the numbers that are **not** perfect powers by subtracting the count of perfect powers from the total.\n\n**Total Numbers:** 150\n**Perfect Powers:** 17\n\n\\[\n\\text{Non-Perfect Powers} = 150 - 17 = 133\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability would be:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Not a Perfect Power}) = \\frac{133}{150}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{133}{150} = \\frac{133 \\div 1}{150 \\div 1} = \\frac{133}{150}\n\\]\n(Nothing to simplify since 133 and 150 have no common factors other than 1.)\n\n### **Final Reflection: Is This Correct?**\n\nThe probability of selecting a number that is **not** a perfect power is \\(\\frac{133}{150}\\). This seems reasonable, but let me think if there\u2019s a verification method.\n\n**Verification Idea: Use Proportions**\n\nGiven that perfect powers are relatively rare compared to non-perfect powers within a range, having 17 out of 150 being perfect powers and thus 133 not being perfect powers seems plausible.\n\n**Another Check: Ratio Approximation**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{133}{150} = \\frac{133}{150} \\times \\frac{2}{2} = \\frac{266}{300} = \\frac{266}{300} \\approx 0.8867\n\\]\n\nThis approximates to about 88.67%, which intuitively makes sense\u2014most numbers are not perfect powers.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, listing perfect powers, and ensuring no duplicates, we find that there are 17 unique perfect powers up to 150. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected number from 1 to 150 is **not** a perfect power is \\(\\frac{133}{150}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{133}{150}}\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect powers. We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \\ldots, 5^{3}$. Notice all the perfect fourth powers are also perfect squares. Similarly, all the perfect sixth powers are also perfect squares. The only perfect powers not yet counted are $2^5=32$ and $2^7=128$. Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1$ and $2^{6} = 64$ which we counted both as perfect squares and perfect cubes. So there is a total $12+5+1+1-2=17$ of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect powers. Thus, $150-17=133$ integers are not perfect powers. The probability that we select such a number is $\\boxed{\\frac{133}{150}}$."
