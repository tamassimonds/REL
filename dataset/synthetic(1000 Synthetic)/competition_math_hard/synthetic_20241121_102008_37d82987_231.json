  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, embracing a natural thought process. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check for correctness, and adjust as needed to arrive at the final solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Okay, the question asks for the number of natural-number factors of \\( n \\) that are multiples of 150.**\n- **Given \\( n = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^{14} \\cdot 5^{8} \\), it reminds me of problems involving prime factorization and determining factors.**\n- **I think I'll need to consider how 150 relates to \\( n \\) and how to count the factors accordingly.**\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. ** **Prime Factorization Approach: ** Maybe I can express 150 in terms of its prime factors and see how it relates to \\( n \\). Then, figure out which factors of \\( n \\) include 150's prime factors.**\n\n2. ** **Counting Factors Method: ** Another idea is to count all factors of \\( n \\) first, then determine how many are multiples of 150. Seems straightforward but might be inefficient.**\n\n3. ** **Using Exponents: ** Possibly leveraging the exponents in \\( n \\) to see how many combinations include the factors of 150.**\n\n**Wait, That Can't Be Right Because...**\n\n- **Thinking of counting all factors first feels like extra work. Maybe focusing directly on factors that are multiples of 150 is better.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization of 150**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Let\u2019s break down 150 into its prime factors to see what conditions its multiples need to satisfy.**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n150 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **So, any multiple of 150 must include at least \\( 2^1 \\), \\( 3^1 \\), and \\( 5^2 \\).**\n- **This gives me a clear idea of what factors of \\( n \\) need to include.**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does 150's factorization make sense? 2 times 3 is 6, and 6 times 25 (which is \\( 5^2 \\)) is 150. Yeah, that's correct.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Necessary Factors in \\( n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **To find factors of \\( n \\) that are multiples of 150, those factors must include \\( 2^1 \\), \\( 3^1 \\), and \\( 5^2 \\).**\n- **Let\u2019s see how many such combinations can be formed from \\( n \\)\u2019s prime factors.**\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\n1. ** **Listing Possible Exponents: ** For each prime factor in 150, determine how many ways we can choose exponents from \\( n \\) that satisfy the requirement.**\n\n2. ** **Using Combinatorics: ** Calculate the number of valid combinations of exponents that include at least the minimum required by 150.**\n\n**Hmm, Maybe I Need to Back Up and Try...**\n\n- **Initially thinking of listing might be too cumbersome. Using combinatorics seems more efficient.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Valid Exponent Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **For each prime factor, determine the range of exponents that satisfy being a multiple of 150.**\n- **Then, multiply these possibilities together to find the total number of factors.**\n\n**Let's Break It Down:**\n\n- **Given \\( n = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^{14} \\cdot 5^{8} \\), so we have:**\n  - **Exponents for 2: 1 to 10 (inclusive)**\n  - **Exponents for 3: 1 to 14 (inclusive)**\n  - **Exponents for 5: 2 to 8 (inclusive)**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Number of choices for each prime factor:**\n  - **Exponents of 2:** 10 choices (1 to 10)**\n  - **Exponents of 3:** 14 choices (1 to 14)**\n  - **Exponents of 5:** 7 choices (2 to 8)**\n  \n- **Total number of factors that are multiples of 150:**\n  \n  \\[\n  10 \\times 14 \\times 7 = 980\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **This approach seems logical\u2014by multiplying the number of valid exponent combinations, we account for all factors of \\( n \\) that include 150 as a factor.**\n- **Does this number make sense given the size of \\( n \\)? It feels reasonable.**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Wait, let me think... Is there a chance I missed something?**\n- **Actually, I might have overlooked factors where exponents are higher than necessary. I need to ensure all combinations satisfy being multiples of 150 without overcounting.**\n\n**Let Me Think About Whether This Approach Makes Sense...**\n\n- **By only considering exponents starting from the minimum required, I might be missing combinations where higher exponents still satisfy the condition.**\n- **Perhaps I need to adjust my strategy to account for all valid exponent combinations, including those exceeding the minimum requirements.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Adjusting the Approach to Count All Valid Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Instead of just counting exponents starting from the minimum, I should consider all possible exponents that still satisfy being multiples of 150.**\n- **This means allowing exponents to vary up to their maximum in \\( n \\), as long as they meet the minimum required by 150.**\n\n**Recalculating the Choices:**\n\n- **Exponents for each prime factor can range from the minimum required by 150 up to the maximum in \\( n \\):**\n  - **For 2:** Exponents from 1 to 10\n  - **For 3:** Exponents from 1 to 14\n  - **For 5:** Exponents from 2 to 8\n\n- **Therefore, the number of valid exponent combinations is:**\n  \n  \\[\n  (10 - 1 + 1) \\times (14 - 1 + 1) \\times (8 - 2 + 1) = 10 \\times 14 \\times 7 = 980\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **By considering all possible exponents that satisfy the multiple of 150 requirement, I ensure that no valid factors are missed.**\n- **This adjusted approach aligns with the initial calculation, confirming its correctness.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Does the total make sense?**\n- **Given the large exponents in \\( n \\), having 980 factors that are multiples of 150 seems plausible.**\n\n**Wait, That Can't Be Right Because...**\n\n- **Actually, looking back, I realize that the initial calculation might still be overcounting.**\n- **Not all combinations of exponents necessarily result in multiples of 150 just by satisfying the minimum exponents individually.**\n- **I need to ensure that the combination of exponents truly forms a multiple of 150.**\n\n**Hmm, Maybe I Need to Back Up and Try...**\n\n- **I might have oversimplified by just multiplying the number of valid exponents for each prime.**\n- **I should reconsider the approach to accurately count only those factors that are true multiples of 150.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Re-evaluating the Approach with a More Accurate Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **To ensure accuracy, perhaps I need to consider the total number of factors of \\( n \\) and then determine what fraction of them are multiples of 150.**\n- **Alternatively, I could compute the number of factors of \\( n \\) that are **not** multiples of 150 and subtract from the total.**\n\n**Exploring a New Strategy:**\n\n1. ** **Counting All Factors of \\( n \\): ** Compute the total number of factors of \\( n \\).**\n\n2. ** **Identifying Factors Not Multiples of 150: ** Determine how many factors do not include the necessary components of 150.**\n\n3. ** **Subtracting to Find Desired Factors: ** Subtract the non-multiples from the total to find the number of factors that are multiples of 150.**\n\n**Oh! This Reminds Me of...**\n\n- **This approach is similar to using complementary counting in probability, where you count the total and subtract the unwanted cases.**\n\n**Let's Proceed with This New Strategy.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating the Total Number of Factors of \\( n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **The total number of factors of a number is determined by adding 1 to each of its exponents in the prime factorization and multiplying these together.**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(10 + 1) \\times (14 + 1) \\times (8 + 1) = 11 \\times 15 \\times 9 = 1,485\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **So, \\( n \\) has 1,485 total factors.**\n- **This gives me a starting point to calculate how many of these are multiples of 150.**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does this calculation make sense? Adding 1 to each exponent accounts for including the zero exponent (i.e., not including the prime factor), so yes, it\u2019s correct.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Determining Factors Not Multiples of 150**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **I need to find the number of factors of \\( n \\) that **do not** include \\( 2^1 \\), \\( 3^1 \\), or \\( 5^2 \\).**\n- **These are the factors that are **not** multiples of 150.**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Factors Not Including \\( 2 \\): ** \n  - **Exponents of 2 can be 0.**\n  - **So, exponents of 2: 0 (1 option)**\n\n- **Factors Not Including \\( 3 \\): ** \n  - **Exponents of 3 can be 0.**\n  - **So, exponents of 3: 0 (1 option)**\n\n- **Factors Not Including \\( 5^2 \\): ** \n  - **Exponents of 5 can be 0 or 1.**\n  - **So, exponents of 5: 0 or 1 (2 options)**\n\n- **Total Number of Factors Not Multiples of 150: **\n  \n  \\[\n  1 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 2\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a minute, that seems too low.**\n- **Only accounting for the minimal cases might underestimate the number of non-multiples.**\n- **Perhaps I need to consider factors that miss any one of the required components of 150, not just all three simultaneously.**\n\n**Hmm, Maybe I Need to Back Up and Try...**\n\n- **This calculation only considers factors missing all components of 150, but there could be factors missing just one or two components.**\n- **I need to refine the approach to capture all such cases.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Correcting the Calculation of Non-Multiples Using Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **To accurately count factors that are **not** multiples of 150, I should apply the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.**\n- **This will help account for factors missing one or more of the necessary prime components.**\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1. ** **Total Factors of \\( n \\): **\n   \n   \\[\n   11 \\times 15 \\times 9 = 1,485\n   \\]\n   \n2. ** **Factors Missing \\( 2 \\): ** \n   - **Exponents of 2 are 0:**\n     \n     \\[\n     1 \\times 15 \\times 9 = 135\n     \\]\n   \n3. ** **Factors Missing \\( 3 \\): ** \n   - **Exponents of 3 are 0:**\n     \n     \\[\n     11 \\times 1 \\times 9 = 99\n     \\]\n   \n4. ** **Factors Missing \\( 5^2 \\): ** \n   - **Exponents of 5 are less than 2 (0 or 1):**\n     \n     \\[\n     11 \\times 15 \\times 2 = 330\n     \\]\n   \n5. ** **However, factors counted in multiple groups need adjusting:**\n\n   - **Factors missing both \\( 2 \\) and \\( 3 \\): **\n     \n     \\[\n     1 \\times 1 \\times 9 = 9\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Factors missing both \\( 2 \\) and \\( 5^2 \\): **\n     \n     \\[\n     1 \\times 15 \\times 2 = 30\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Factors missing both \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5^2 \\): **\n     \n     \\[\n     11 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 22\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Factors missing \\( 2 \\), \\( 3 \\), and \\( 5^2 \\): **\n     \n     \\[\n     1 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 2\n     \\]\n   \n6. ** **Applying Inclusion-Exclusion: **\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Non-Multiples of 150} = 135 + 99 + 330 - 9 - 30 - 22 + 2 = 505\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Now, the number of factors that are **not** multiples of 150 is 505.**\n- **This makes more sense than the initial underestimate.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Does this calculation align with the total number of factors?**\n- **Subtracting non-multiples from the total should give us the desired count of multiples of 150.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Calculating the Number of Factors That Are Multiples of 150**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Now that I have the number of factors that are **not** multiples of 150, I can subtract this from the total number of factors to find the number of factors that are multiples of 150.**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Factors Multiples of 150} = \\text{Total Factors} - \\text{Non-Multiples of 150} = 1,485 - 505 = 980\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Hmm, interesting! This matches the earlier calculation where I directly counted the valid exponent combinations.**\n- **But now, with the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle applied, it confirms the correctness of the approach.**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does this result make sense?**\n- **Given the large exponents in \\( n \\), having 980 factors that are multiples of 150 seems plausible.**\n- **The consistency between different methods adds confidence to the correctness.**\n\n**Actually, There Might Be an Easier Way...**\n\n- **Wait, upon reviewing, I realize that the initial direct counting of exponent combinations was indeed accurate.**\n- **The confusion arose from an overcomplicated interpretation, but the fundamental approach was correct.**\n- **Therefore, the final answer remains valid.**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\text{<ANSWER>} 980 \\text{ factors are multiples of } 150. \\text{solution</ANSWER>}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Reflections**\n\n- **By exploring multiple strategies, including direct exponent counting and the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, I ensured the accuracy of the solution.**\n- **Initial hesitations and recalculations helped confirm the correctness of the approach, leading to a reliable final answer.**\n- **Embracing a human-like problem-solving process, with brainstorming, checking for correctness, and adjusting strategies, facilitated a thorough and accurate solution.**\n\n---\n\n\\[\n\\text{I hope this detailed, human-like walkthrough provides a comprehensive understanding of how to approach and solve the problem effectively.}\n\\]\n    \n    <ANSWER>980 factors are multiples of 150.solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "$150=2^13^15^2$.  Thus the coefficient of $2$ must be between $1$ and $10$, the coefficient of $3$ must be between $1$ and $14$, and the coefficient of $5$ must be between $2$ and $8$.  So the number of possible factors is\n\n$$(10)(14)(7)=\\boxed{980}$$"
