  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I would tackle it if I were solving it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking for correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let's get into it.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, it involves a triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with lines \\( CE \\) and \\( AD \\) intersecting at point \\( P \\). The ratios of segments along these lines are given, and I need to find \\( r = \\frac{CP}{PE} \\).\n\nInitial reactions:\n\n- **This feels like a classic geometry problem involving cevians and their intersections.**\n- **Maybe I can use the **[**Ceva's Theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceva%27s_theorem)** or **[**mass points**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_point_geometry)** to solve it.**\n- **Alternatively, coordinate geometry might work by assigning coordinates and solving for \\( P \\).**\n\nBut before jumping in, let's brainstorm which method might be the most efficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Ceva's Theorem or Menelaus' Theorem:**\n   - These theorems deal with concurrent cevians and ratios, which seems applicable here.\n\n2. **Mass Points (Weighted Averages):**\n   - Assigning \"masses\" to points to balance the ratios could simplify finding \\( r \\).\n\n3. **Coordinate Geometry:**\n   - Assigning coordinates to \\( A, B, C \\) and finding \\( P \\) using equations of lines.\n\n4. **Using Proportionality and Similar Triangles:**\n   - Perhaps leveraging properties of similar triangles formed by the intersecting cevians.\n\n**Reflection:** Given the ratios and the need to find another ratio involving \\( P \\), **mass points** or **Ceva\u2019s Theorem** seem promising. **Coordinate geometry** might get messy with systems of equations, so maybe it's not the best first choice.\n\n---\n\n### **Starting with Mass Points**\n\n**Thought Process:** Mass points often simplify problems involving multiple ratios by assigning \"weights\" to points, making it easier to find ratios of segments.\n\n**Let's give it a try:**\n\n1. **Assign Masses Based on Given Ratios:**\n   - For \\( \\frac{CD}{DB} = \\frac{3}{1} \\), assign:\n     - \\( D \\) has mass 3, \\( B \\) has mass 1.\n     - **Total mass at \\( C \\) = 3 + 1 = 4.**\n   \n   - For \\( \\frac{AE}{EB} = \\frac{3}{2} \\), assign:\n     - \\( A \\) has mass 3, \\( B \\) has mass 2.\n     - **Total mass at \\( E \\) = 3 + 2 = 5.**\n\n2. **Determine the Mass at Intersection \\( P \\):**\n   - Since \\( P \\) is the intersection of \\( CE \\) and \\( AD \\), it must balance the masses along both cevians.\n\n**Reflection:** This approach requires careful balancing, and it's easy to make mistakes. Let me double-check if assigning masses aligns with the ratios correctly.\n\n**Checking:**\n- **For \\( CE \\):**\n  - \\( C \\) has total mass 4 (from \\( D \\) and \\( B \\)),\n  - \\( E \\) has total mass 5 (from \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)).\n  \n- **For \\( AD \\):**\n  - \\( A \\) has mass 3,\n  - \\( D \\) has mass 3 (from \\( CD:DB = 3:1 \\)).\n\n**Wait a minute:** This doesn't seem straightforward because the masses don't directly correspond to the ratios along both cevians simultaneously. **Maybe mass points aren't the best approach here.**\n\n**Conclusion:** **Mass points** might complicate things since the intersection involves balancing along two different cevians with different ratios. **I need to try another method.**\n\n---\n\n### **Switching to Coordinate Geometry**\n\n**Thought Process:** Let's assign coordinates to the vertices and use the given ratios to find the coordinates of \\( P \\). This method provides a concrete way to calculate \\( r \\).\n\n**Let\u2019s proceed:**\n\n1. **Assign Coordinates to \\( A, B, C \\):**\n   - Let\u2019s set:\n     - \\( A = (0, 0) \\)\n     - \\( B = (1, 0) \\)\n     - \\( C = (c_x, c_y) \\)\n     \n     **Reflection:** Assigning \\( B \\) at \\( (1, 0) \\) instead of \\( (b, 0) \\) simplifies calculations by making the base \\( AB \\) unit length.\n\n2. **Find Coordinates of Points \\( D \\) and \\( E \\):**\n  \n   - **Point \\( D \\) on \\( CB \\):**  \n     Given \\( \\frac{CD}{DB} = \\frac{3}{1} \\), so \\( D \\) is closer to \\( B \\).  \n     Using section formula:  \n     \\[\n     D = \\left( \\frac{3 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot c_x}{3 + 1}, \\frac{3 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot c_y}{3 + 1} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{3 + c_x}{4}, \\frac{c_y}{4} \\right) \n     \\]\n\n     **Check:**  \n     - **Does this make sense?**  \n       - Yes, the coordinates reflect a point 3/4 of the way from \\( C \\) to \\( B \\).\n\n   - **Point \\( E \\) on \\( AB \\):**  \n     Given \\( \\frac{AE}{EB} = \\frac{3}{2} \\), so \\( E \\) is closer to \\( B \\).  \n     Using section formula:  \n     \\[\n     E = \\left( \\frac{3 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 0}{3 + 2}, \\frac{3 \\cdot 0 + 2 \\cdot 0}{3 + 2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{3}{5}, 0 \\right)\n     \\]\n     \n     **Check:**  \n     - **Does this make sense?**  \n       - Yes, \\( E \\) is 3/5 of the way from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) along the x-axis.\n\n3. **Determine Equations of Lines \\( CE \\) and \\( AD \\):**\n\n   - **Line \\( CE \\):**  \n     Slope \\( m_{CE} = \\frac{0 - c_y}{\\frac{3}{5} - c_x} = \\frac{-c_y}{\\frac{3}{5} - c_x} \\)  \n     Equation:  \n     \\[\n     y - c_y = m_{CE} (x - c_x) \n     \\]\n     \n   - **Line \\( AD \\):**  \n     Slope \\( m_{AD} = \\frac{\\frac{c_y}{4} - 0}{\\frac{3 + c_x}{4} - 0} = \\frac{c_y}{3 + c_x} \\)  \n     Equation:  \n     \\[\n     y = m_{AD} x \n     \\]\n     \n     **Reflection:** The equations are becoming complex, and solving for \\( P \\) might involve messy algebra. But let's see it through.\n\n4. **Find Intersection Point \\( P \\):**  \n   \n   Solve the system of equations:\n   \\[\n   y - c_y = \\frac{-c_y}{\\frac{3}{5} - c_x} (x - c_x) \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{c_y}{3 + c_x} x \n   \\]\n   \n   **Substitute \\( y \\) from the second equation into the first:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{c_y}{3 + c_x} x - c_y = \\frac{-c_y}{\\frac{3}{5} - c_x} (x - c_x) \n   \\]\n   \n   **Simplify:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{c_y}{3 + c_x} (x - (3 + c_x)) = \\frac{-c_y}{\\frac{3}{5} - c_x} (x - c_x) \n   \\]\n   \n   **Wait a moment:** This is getting quite involved. It might be time-consuming to solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) explicitly. Maybe there's a better way.\n\n**Reflection:** **Coordinate geometry** is making the problem more cumbersome than expected. **Perhaps Ceva\u2019s Theorem** would be more straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:** **Coordinate geometry** is valid but not the most efficient here. **Let's switch to Ceva\u2019s Theorem.**\n\n---\n\n### **Applying Ceva\u2019s Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:** Ceva\u2019s Theorem relates the ratios of segments created by concurrent cevians. Given that \\( CE \\) and \\( AD \\) intersect at \\( P \\), we can use this theorem to find the desired ratio.\n\n**Let\u2019s proceed:**\n\n1. **Ceva\u2019s Theorem Statement:**\n\n   For cevians \\( AD \\), \\( BE \\), and \\( CF \\) concurrent at \\( P \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{AE}{EB} \\cdot \\frac{BD}{DC} \\cdot \\frac{CF}{FA} = 1\n   \\]\n   \n   **Given Ratios:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{CD}{DB} = \\frac{3}{1} \\implies \\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{AE}{EB} = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Simplify:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{CF}{FA} = 1 \\implies \\frac{CF}{FA} = 2\n   \\]\n   \n   **Interpretation:**  \n   - This suggests that \\( CF \\) and \\( FA \\) are in a \\( 2:1 \\) ratio.\n\n**Reflection:** This information aligns with Ceva\u2019s Theorem, but we still need to find \\( r = \\frac{CP}{PE} \\). **Ceva\u2019s Theorem** alone doesn't directly provide \\( r \\), so we need another step.\n\n**Wait a minute:** Ceva\u2019s Theorem gives the ratio along the third cevian \\( CF \\), but our goal is to find \\( r \\) along \\( CE \\). **Perhaps we need to combine this with another concept.**\n\n---\n\n### **Combining with Menelaus\u2019 Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:** Menelaus\u2019 Theorem deals with collinearity and can relate ratios along intersecting cevians. **Maybe it can provide the missing link to find \\( r \\).**\n\n**Let\u2019s try it:**\n\n1. **Menelaus\u2019 Theorem Application:**  \n   \n   For a transversal intersecting the sides of a triangle, the product of certain ratios is 1. However, in this case, applying Menelaus directly isn't straightforward because we don't have a transversal.\n\n**Wait a moment:** **Menelaus' Theorem** might not be directly applicable here since we're dealing with concurrent cevians, not a transversal. **Perhaps it's not the right tool.**\n\n**Conclusion:** **Menelaus\u2019 Theorem** isn't helpful in this context. **We need to find another way.**\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting Mass Points with a New Perspective**\n\n**Thought Process:** **Maybe I can reframe mass points** by considering the intersection point \\( P \\) and the ratios along \\( CE \\) and \\( AD \\). **Let\u2019s see if assigning masses differently can help.**\n\n**Let\u2019s proceed:**\n\n1. **Assign Masses Based on Given Ratios:**\n   - **For \\( \\frac{CD}{DB} = \\frac{3}{1} \\):**\n     - Assign mass 1 to \\( D \\) and mass 3 to \\( B \\).\n     - **Total mass at \\( C \\) = 1 + 3 = 4.**\n\n   - **For \\( \\frac{AE}{EB} = \\frac{3}{2} \\):**\n     - Assign mass 2 to \\( A \\) and mass 3 to \\( E \\).\n     - **Total mass at \\( B \\) = 2 + 3 = 5.**\n\n2. **Determine Mass at Intersection \\( P \\):**\n   - **Point \\( P \\)** lies on both \\( CE \\) and \\( AD \\), so it must balance the masses.\n\n**Reflection:** This approach still requires balancing along both cevians simultaneously, which can be tricky. **Maybe assigning masses to \\( P \\) based on one cevian and checking consistency on the other could work.**\n\n**Let\u2019s try assigning masses along \\( CE \\):**\n\n3. **Assign Masses Along \\( CE \\):**\n   - Let\u2019s assume \\( P \\) divides \\( CE \\) in the ratio \\( r = \\frac{CP}{PE} \\).\n   - Therefore, the mass at \\( P \\) from \\( C \\) is proportional to \\( E \\).\n\n**Calculating Mass Ratios:**\n\n- **From \\( C \\) to \\( E \\):**\n  - Total mass at \\( C \\) is 4.\n  - Total mass at \\( E \\) is 5.\n\n- **Assigning Mass to \\( P \\):**\n  - If \\( CP = r \\cdot PE \\), then the mass at \\( P \\) must balance these proportions.\n\n**Wait a minute:** This is still abstract without concrete values. **Perhaps it's better to leverage proportionality directly.**\n\n---\n\n### **Leveraging Proportionality and Section Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:** **Using the section formula** to express \\( P \\) in terms of known ratios along both cevians might lead us to \\( r \\).\n\n**Let\u2019s proceed:**\n\n1. **Express \\( P \\) on \\( CE \\) Using the Section Formula:**\n   \n   Given \\( P \\) divides \\( CE \\) in the ratio \\( r = \\frac{CP}{PE} \\), we can write:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{E + r \\cdot C}{1 + r} \n   \\]\n   \n   **Wait, let\u2019s assign coordinates to make this concrete.**\n\n2. **Assign Coordinates:**\n   - Let\u2019s set:\n     - \\( C = (0, 1) \\)\n     - \\( E = (3, 0) \\)\n   \n   **Reflection:** Assigning \\( C \\) and \\( E \\) coordinates based on their positions simplifies the calculations.\n\n3. **Apply Section Formula:**\n   \n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{(3, 0) + r \\cdot (0, 1)}{1 + r} = \\left( \\frac{3}{1 + r}, \\frac{r}{1 + r} \\right) \n   \\]\n   \n   **Check:**  \n   - **Does this make sense?**  \n     - Yes, \\( P \\)\u2019s coordinates depend on \\( r \\), reflecting its position along \\( CE \\).\n\n4. **Express \\( P \\) on \\( AD \\) Using the Given Ratio:**\n   \n   Given that \\( P \\) also lies on \\( AD \\), we need to express \\( P \\) in terms of the ratio along \\( AD \\).\n\n**Wait a moment:** To do this, we need the coordinates of \\( A \\) and \\( D \\). Let\u2019s assign them.\n\n5. **Assign Coordinates to \\( A \\) and \\( D \\):**\n   \n   Let\u2019s set:\n   - \\( A = (0, 0) \\)\n   - \\( D = (2, 3) \\)\n   \n   **Reflection:** These coordinates are chosen to reflect the given ratios along \\( AB \\) and \\( CB \\).\n\n6. **Express \\( P \\) on \\( AD \\) Using the Section Formula:**\n   \n   Suppose \\( P \\) divides \\( AD \\) in an unknown ratio. Let\u2019s say \\( P = (x, y) \\).\n\n   Using the section formula:\n   \\[\n   P = \\left( \\frac{2m}{m + 1}, \\frac{3m}{m + 1} \\right) \n   \\]\n   \n   **Check:**  \n   - **Does this align with our previous expression for \\( P \\)?**  \n     - Yes, but now we have two expressions for \\( P \\) that must be equal.\n\n7. **Set the Two Expressions for \\( P \\) Equal:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{3}{1 + r}, \\frac{r}{1 + r} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{2m}{m + 1}, \\frac{3m}{m + 1} \\right) \n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:** By equating the corresponding coordinates, we can solve for \\( r \\) in terms of \\( m \\), or directly find \\( r \\).\n\n**Wait a minute:** This requires solving a system of equations. Let\u2019s proceed carefully.\n\n8. **Equate Corresponding Coordinates:**\n   \n   - **X-coordinates:**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{1 + r} = \\frac{2m}{m + 1}\n     \\]\n     \n   - **Y-coordinates:**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{r}{1 + r} = \\frac{3m}{m + 1}\n     \\]\n     \n   **Reflection:** Solving either equation for \\( m \\) in terms of \\( r \\) or vice versa will help us find \\( r \\).\n\n9. **Solve for \\( m \\) in Terms of \\( r \\):**\n   \n   From the X-coordinate equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{1 + r} = \\frac{2m}{m + 1} \n   \\]\n   \n   Cross-multiply:\n   \\[\n   3(m + 1) = 2m(1 + r) \n   \\]\n   \n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   3m + 3 = 2mr + 2m \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3 = 2mr - m \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3 = m(2r - 1) \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{3}{2r - 1} \n   \\]\n   \n   **Check:**  \n   - **Does this expression make sense?**  \n     - Yes, it gives \\( m \\) in terms of \\( r \\), which we can substitute back into the Y-coordinate equation.\n\n10. **Substitute \\( m \\) into the Y-coordinate Equation:**\n    \n    \\[\n    \\frac{r}{1 + r} = \\frac{3 \\left( \\frac{3}{2r - 1} \\right) }{\\frac{3}{2r - 1} + 1} \n    \\]\n    \n    Simplify the denominator:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{3}{2r - 1} + 1 = \\frac{3 + (2r - 1)}{2r - 1} = \\frac{2r + 2}{2r - 1} \n    \\]\n    \n    So, the equation becomes:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{r}{1 + r} = \\frac{3 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2r - 1}}{\\frac{2r + 2}{2r - 1}} = \\frac{9}{2r + 2}\n    \\]\n    \n    **Reflection:** This equation can be solved for \\( r \\).\n\n11. **Solve for \\( r \\):**\n    \n    \\[\n    \\frac{r}{1 + r} = \\frac{9}{2r + 2}\n    \\]\n    \n    Cross-multiply:\n    \\[\n    r(2r + 2) = 9(1 + r) \n    \\]\n    \n    Expand:\n    \\[\n    2r^2 + 2r = 9 + 9r \n    \\]\n    \n    Rearrange:\n    \\[\n    2r^2 + 2r - 9r - 9 = 0 \n    \\]\n    \\[\n    2r^2 - 7r - 9 = 0 \n    \\]\n    \n    **Wait a minute:** This is a quadratic equation.

**Perhaps identifying similar triangles can help relate \\( CP \\) and \\( PE \\).**\n\n2. **Projective Geometry:**\n   - **Cross-ratio might be applicable, but it\u2019s more advanced than necessary.**\n\n3. **Simplifying Ratios Using Proportional Segments:**\n   - **Directly applying the given ratios to express \\( r \\) in terms of known quantities.**\n\n**Reflection:** **Similar triangles** seem promising because the intersecting cevians likely create overlapping triangles with proportional sides.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Similar Triangles**\n\n**Thought Process:** **Identifying triangles that share angles and have sides proportional to \\( CP \\) and \\( PE \\).** This can directly relate \\( r \\) to the given ratios.\n\n**Let\u2019s proceed:**\n\n1. **Identifying Relevant Triangles:**\n   \n   Look for triangles that include \\( CP \\) and \\( PE \\), and that are similar to each other.\n\n   **Triangles \\( \\triangle CPE \\) and \\( \\triangle PCD \\):**\n   -
