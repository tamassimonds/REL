  "problem": "On an old-fashioned bicycle the front wheel has a radius of $2.5$ feet and the back wheel has a radius of $4$ inches.  If there is no slippage, how many revolutions will the back wheel make while the front wheel makes $100$ revolutions?",
  "solution": "Certainly! Let's craft a clean, coherent solution by organizing our thought process effectively while maintaining the essential elements of brainstorming, exploring strategies, and validating our approach. Here's how I'd present it:\n\n---\n\n# **Problem Statement**\n\nA bicycle has two wheels of different sizes:\n- **Front Wheel Radius:** 2.5 feet\n- **Back Wheel Radius:** 4 inches\n\nWhen the front wheel completes 100 revolutions, how many revolutions does the back wheel make?\n\n---\n\n# **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n- **Initial Ideas:**\n  - Calculate the circumferences of both wheels to understand how their sizes relate.\n  - Use ratios to determine the relationship between the revolutions of the front and back wheels.\n  - Consider the total distance each wheel covers during 100 revolutions.\n\n- **Preferred Approach:** Calculating circumferences and using ratios seems straightforward, but let's remain open to confirming this with alternative methods.\n\n---\n\n# **Step 1: Calculating Wheel Circumferences**\n\n**Thought Process:** The circumference of a wheel determines the distance it covers in one revolution. Knowing both circumferences will help establish how many revolutions the back wheel needs to match the front wheel's distance.\n\n### **Front Wheel**\n- **Radius:** 2.5 feet\n- **Circumference (\\(C_{\\text{front}}\\)):**  \n  \\[\n  C_{\\text{front}} = 2\\pi \\times 2.5 = 5\\pi \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\n### **Back Wheel**\n- **Radius:** 4 inches\n\n  *Wait a moment:* The front wheel's radius is in feet, while the back wheel's radius is in inches. To maintain consistency, let's convert the back wheel's radius to feet.\n\n- **Conversion:**  \n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ inches} = \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\n- **Circumference (\\(C_{\\text{back}}\\)):**  \n  \\[\n  C_{\\text{back}} = 2\\pi \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n# **Step 2: Establishing the Ratio of Revolutions**\n\n**Idea:** The number of revolutions is inversely proportional to the circumference. A smaller circumference means more revolutions are needed to cover the same distance.\n\n### **Setting Up the Ratio**\n\\[\n\\frac{N_{\\text{back}}}{N_{\\text{front}}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{front}}}{C_{\\text{back}}}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(N_{\\text{front}} = 100\\) revolutions\n- Plugging in the circumferences:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{N_{\\text{back}}}{100} = \\frac{5\\pi}{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\n  \\]\n\n### **Simplifying the Ratio**\n\\[\n\\frac{5\\pi}{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}} = \\frac{5\\pi \\times 3}{2\\pi} = \\frac{15\\pi}{2\\pi} = \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:** For every revolution of the front wheel, the back wheel makes 7.5 revolutions.\n\n---\n\n# **Step 3: Calculating Total Revolutions of the Back Wheel**\n\n\\[\nN_{\\text{back}} = 100 \\times 7.5 = 750\n\\]\n\n---\n\n# **Alternative Strategy: Visualizing Total Distance Covered**\n\n**Reflection:** Let's verify our solution by considering the total distance traveled.\n\n### **Calculating Total Distance by Front Wheel**\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = 100 \\times C_{\\text{front}} = 100 \\times 5\\pi = 500\\pi \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\n### **Determining Revolutions Needed for Back Wheel**\n\\[\nN_{\\text{back}} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{C_{\\text{back}}} = \\frac{500\\pi}{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\n\\]\n\n### **Simplifying**\n\\[\n\\frac{500\\pi \\times 3}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1500\\pi}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1500}{2} = 750\n\\]\n\n**Confirmation:** Both strategies lead to the same result\u2014750 revolutions.\n\n---\n\n# **Final Check: Does It Make Sense?**\n\n- **Consistency:** The back wheel has a smaller circumference (\\(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\) feet) compared to the front wheel (\\(5\\pi\\) feet), so it needs more revolutions to cover the same distance.\n- **Logical Reasoning:** The ratio \\(\\frac{15}{2} = 7.5\\) confirms that the back wheel makes 7.5 revolutions for each revolution of the front wheel, totaling 750 revolutions for 100 front-wheel revolutions.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>750 revolutions</ANSWER>\n\n# **Final Answer**\n\nThe back wheel will make **750 revolutions** while the front wheel completes 100 revolutions.\n\n---\n\n# **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Effective Strategy:** Calculating circumferences and applying ratios provided a clear path to the solution.\n- **Unit Consistency:** Converting the back wheel's radius to feet was crucial for accurate calculations.\n- **Verification:** An alternative method confirmed the correctness of the initial approach, strengthening confidence in the solution.\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, verifying each step, and ensuring unit consistency, we confidently arrived at the correct answer.",
  "ground_truth": "The circumference of the front wheel is $2\\pi \\cdot 2.5=5\\pi$ feet. In 100 revolutions, the front wheel travels $5\\pi \\cdot 100 = 500\\pi$ feet. The back wheel must travel the same distance because they are both attached to the same bike. The circumference of the back wheel is $2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ feet (note that 4 inches is equal to $\\frac{1}{3}$ feet). Thus, the number of revolutions of the back wheel is $\\frac{500\\pi}{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi}=\\boxed{750}$."
