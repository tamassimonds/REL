  "problem": "How many points of intersection are there between the graphs of the following equations: \\begin{align*}\ny &=|2x + 5|, \\\\\ny &= -|3x - 2|\n\\end{align*}",
  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's craft a comprehensive solution by incorporating your step-by-step thinking process. We'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and adjusting our approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, the task is to find the number of intersection points between these two graphs:\n\n\\[\ny = |2x + 5|\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -|3x - 2|\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nHmm, dealing with absolute value functions here. I remember that absolute value graphs are V-shaped: one opens upwards, and the negative absolute value flips it downwards. So, we have one graph pointing up and the other pointing down. Intuitively, it seems like their intersection points would be where these V-shapes meet.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **Plot Both Graphs:** Visualizing might give a quick insight.\n- **Set Equations Equal:** Algebraically find where their \\( y \\)-values are the same.\n- **Analyze Symmetry:** Use properties of absolute values to determine intersection points.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure which method is the most efficient right now, but let's explore each one to see what works best.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **1. Plot Both Graphs Visually**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nMaybe drawing both graphs can help me see how many times they intersect.\n\n**Attempt:**  \n- **Graph \\( y = |2x + 5| \\):**  \n  - It's a V-shaped graph opening upwards with its vertex at \\( x = -\\frac{5}{2} \\).\n- **Graph \\( y = -|3x - 2| \\):**  \n  - This one opens downwards with its vertex at \\( x = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLooking at a rough sketch, it seems like there might be two intersection points. But sketches can be deceiving, so I can't rely solely on this visual approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGood for initial intuition, but I need a more precise method to confirm.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Set Equations Equal to Find Intersection Points**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFinding \\( x \\) values where both equations have the same \\( y \\) value makes sense. Let's set them equal:\n\n\\[\n|2x + 5| = -|3x - 2|\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute:**  \nHold on! The right side is negative, and absolute values are always non-negative. So, can these ever be equal?\n\n**Reflection:**  \nActually, that's a strong insight. Absolute values can't equal negative numbers unless specific conditions apply. This suggests there might be no intersection points. But let's think deeper\u2014could there be exceptional cases?\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAt first glance, it seems impossible for the equations to intersect, but I should explore further to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Breaking Down the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nMaybe I can analyze both sides separately to see if and where they might intersect.\n\n#### **Case 1: Both Absolute Values Are Zero**\n\n**Idea:**  \nIf both absolute values are zero, their negatives would also be zero. Let's check:\n\n\\[\n|2x + 5| = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |3x - 2| = 0\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n- For \\( |2x + 5| = 0 \\):  \n  \\[\n  2x + 5 = 0 \\implies x = -\\frac{5}{2}\n  \\]\n- For \\( |3x - 2| = 0 \\):  \n  \\[\n  3x -2 = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{2}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThese are two different points. Let's verify if they are intersections by checking the corresponding \\( y \\)-values.\n\n- **At \\( x = -\\frac{5}{2} \\):**  \n  - For \\( y = |2x + 5| \\):  \n    \\[\n    y = |2(-\\frac{5}{2}) + 5| = |0| = 0\n    \\]\n  - For \\( y = -|3x - 2| \\):  \n    \\[\n    y = -|3(-\\frac{5}{2}) - 2| = -|-\\frac{15}{2} - 2| = -|-\\frac{19}{2}| = -\\frac{19}{2}\n    \\]\n  \n  **Observation:**  \n  The \\( y \\)-values don't match! So, \\( x = -\\frac{5}{2} \\) is not an intersection point.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo intersection at \\( x = -\\frac{5}{2} \\) or \\( x = \\frac{2}{3} \\). This suggests that there might be no real intersection points, but let's explore further.\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting the Strategy: Considering Different Sections of the Graphs**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAbsolute value functions have different expressions based on the sign inside. Perhaps I need to consider cases where the expressions inside the absolute values change signs.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- Split the problem into regions based on where each absolute value changes.\n- Analyze each region separately to see if intersections occur.\n\n**Let's Try This:**\n\n#### **Step 1: Identify Critical Points**\n\n**Critical Points:**  \n- For \\( |2x + 5| \\): Changes at \\( x = -\\frac{5}{2} \\).\n- For \\( |3x - 2| \\): Changes at \\( x = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n**Regions to Consider:**  \n1. \\( x < -\\frac{5}{2} \\)\n2. \\( -\\frac{5}{2} \\leq x < \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n3. \\( x \\geq \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI'll analyze each region to see if intersections occur.\n\n---\n\n#### **Region 1: \\( x < -\\frac{5}{2} \\)**\n\n**Expressions:**\n- \\( y = -(2x + 5) \\)\n- \\( y = -|3x - 2| \\)\n\n**Set Equations Equal:**\n\\[\n-(2x + 5) = -|3x - 2| \\implies 2x + 5 = |3x - 2|\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis simplifies to solving \\( 2x + 5 = 3x - 2 \\) or \\( 2x + 5 = -(3x - 2) \\). Let's solve both cases.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Case 1:**  \n  \\[\n  2x + 5 = 3x - 2 \\implies x = 7\n  \\]\n- **Case 2:**  \n  \\[\n  2x + 5 = -(3x - 2) \\implies 2x + 5 = -3x + 2 \\implies 5x = -3 \\implies x = -\\frac{3}{5}\n  \\]\n\n**Wait a Minute:**  \nBut \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -\\frac{3}{5} \\) don't lie in \\( x < -\\frac{5}{2} \\). So, no intersections in this region.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo intersections here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Region 2: \\( -\\frac{5}{2} \\leq x < \\frac{2}{3} \\)**\n\n**Expressions:**\n- \\( y = 2x + 5 \\)\n- \\( y = -|3x - 2| \\)\n\n**Set Equations Equal:**\n\\[\n2x + 5 = -|3x - 2|\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSolving this again involves considering when \\( 2x + 5 \\) equals the negative of \\( |3x - 2| \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Case 1:**  \n  \\[\n  2x + 5 = -(3x - 2) \\implies 2x + 5 = -3x + 2 \\implies 5x = -3 \\implies x = -\\frac{3}{5}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Check if \\( x = -\\frac{3}{5} \\) lies in the region:**  \n  Yes, \\( -\\frac{5}{2} \\leq -\\frac{3}{5} < \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n  \n  **Find \\( y \\):**  \n  \\[\n  y = 2(-\\frac{3}{5}) + 5 = -\\frac{6}{5} + 5 = \\frac{19}{5}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = -|3(-\\frac{3}{5}) - 2| = -|-\\frac{9}{5} - 2| = -|-\\frac{19}{5}| = -\\frac{19}{5}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Reflection:**  \n  Wait, the \\( y \\)-values are positive for \\( y = |2x + 5| \\) and negative for \\( y = -|3x - 2| \\). That's inconsistent!\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo valid intersection here either.\n\n---\n\n#### **Region 3: \\( x \\geq \\frac{2}{3} \\)**\n\n**Expressions:**\n- \\( y = 2x + 5 \\)\n- \\( y = -(3x - 2) \\)\n\n**Set Equations Equal:**\n\\[\n2x + 5 = -(3x - 2) \\implies 2x + 5 = -3x + 2 \\implies 5x = -3 \\implies x = -\\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute:**  \nBut \\( x = -\\frac{3}{5} \\) doesn't lie in \\( x \\geq \\frac{2}{3} \\). So, no intersections here either.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo intersections in this region.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflecting on the Approach: What's Going On?**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI've considered different regions based on where the absolute values change signs and tried to find intersections, but none of the solutions are valid within their respective regions. This suggests that perhaps there are no real solutions where these two graphs intersect.\n\n**Wait a Minute:**  \nBut does that make sense? Two V-shaped graphs, one pointing up and one pointing down\u2014shouldn't they intersect somewhere? Maybe I need to double-check my reasoning or consider that they only touch at a specific point.\n\n**New Strategy:**  \nPerhaps the graphs only intersect at a single point where both absolute values are zero, but earlier, we found that the \\( y \\)-values don't match there. Let me reconsider if there's any special case I might have missed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Confirming No Intersection Points**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nGiven that absolute values are always non-negative, and one equation involves a negative absolute value, it's inherently contradictory for their \\( y \\)-values to be equal except potentially at specific points. However, our earlier checks showed inconsistencies even at those points.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAfter exploring multiple strategies\u2014graphical visualization, setting equations equal, and analyzing different regions\u2014it's clear that there are no real points where these two graphs intersect.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThere are **no** points of intersection between the graphs of \\( y = |2x + 5| \\) and \\( y = -|3x - 2| \\).\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nLooking back, the key insight was recognizing that an absolute value expression being equal to a negative absolute value is generally impossible, except under very specific conditions that don't apply here. Initially, it seemed counterintuitive that there would be no intersections, but careful analysis confirmed it.\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step, exploring different methods, and reflecting frequently, I was able to arrive at the correct conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Considered plotting graphs and setting equations equal.\n- **Visual Check:** Suggested possible intersections but lacked precision.\n- **Algebraic Approach:** Setting equations equal revealed contradictions.\n- **Region Analysis:** Examined different sections based on absolute value changes, finding no valid intersections.\n- **Final Reflection:** Confirmed no intersections through multiple strategies.\n\nThrough this thorough exploration, we confidently conclude that there are no intersection points between the given graphs.",
  "ground_truth": "The first function has a minimum value of 0, while the second has a maximum of 0.  Also, their zeros occur at different spots (in the former case, at $x = -\\frac{5}{2}$, in the latter, at $x = \\frac{2}{3}$).  Hence their graphs do not intersect, so our answer is $\\boxed{0}.$"
