  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, reflecting on each approach to ensure clarity and correctness. I'll incorporate brainstorming, checking, and validating strategies throughout the process to arrive at the final solution naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\n- **Initial Thoughts:** \n  - We have an isosceles triangle with sides \\(\\cos x, \\cos x,\\) and \\(\\cos 7x\\), and a vertex angle of \\(2x\\). All angles are in degrees.\n  - Our goal is to find all possible values of \\(x\\).\n\n- **First Impressions:**\n  - This involves trigonometry and properties of isosceles triangles.\n  - Possible strategies include using the **Cosine Rule**, exploiting **isosceles triangle properties**, or applying **trigonometric identities**.\n\n- **Brainstorming:**\n  - **Cosine Rule:** Relate sides and angles.\n  - **Isosceles Properties:** Equal angles might simplify the problem.\n  - **Trigonometric Identities:** Connect \\(\\cos x\\) and \\(\\cos 7x\\).\n\n*First instincts are important, even if they lead to dead ends. Let's proceed and see where this takes us.*\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Using the Cosine Rule**\n\n- **Thought Process:** \n  - Apply the Cosine Rule to relate the sides and the included angle.\n  - Formula:  \n    \\[\n    c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cdot \\cos(C)\n    \\]\n\n- **Application:**\n  - Let\u2019s apply it to our triangle:\n    \\[\n    (\\cos 7x)^2 = (\\cos x)^2 + (\\cos x)^2 - 2(\\cos x)(\\cos x)\\cos(2x)\n    \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying:**\n  \\[\n    (\\cos 7x)^2 = 2(\\cos x)^2 - 2(\\cos x)^2 \\cos(2x)\n    \\]\n  \\[\n    (\\cos 7x)^2 = 2(\\cos x)^2 (1 - \\cos(2x))\n    \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - This expression is getting complicated.\n  - **Wait, that can't be right because...** it's leading to a messy equation that's not straightforward to solve.\n  - Perhaps this isn't the best approach.\n\n**Conclusion:** The Cosine Rule is overcomplicating things here. Let's try a different strategy.\n\n*Acknowledging that this path isn't leading to a solution is important. Let's explore another strategy.*\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Leveraging Isosceles Triangle Properties**\n\n- **New Idea:** \n  - **Hmm, maybe I need to back up and try...** focusing on the fact that the triangle is isosceles, so the base angles are equal.\n  \n- **Thought Process:**\n  - In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. So, the base angles are each \\(x\\).\n  \n- **Set Up:**\n  - Therefore, the angles are \\(x, x, 2x\\), and the sides are \\(\\cos x, \\cos x, \\cos 7x\\).\n  \n- **Brainstorming:**\n  - Consider using the **Law of Sines** or set up an equation based on angle relationships.\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - But, the Law of Sines involves ratios of sides to sines of angles, and our sides are cosines of angles.\n  - **Actually, there might be an easier way...** This doesn't seem to directly help.\n\n**Conclusion:** This approach doesn't directly apply. Let's think of another method.\n\n*Realizing that this approach doesn't directly apply helps me pivot to another idea.*\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Creating a Right Triangle Within**\n\n- **Thought Process:** \n  - **Oh! This reminds me of...** splitting the isosceles triangle into two right triangles by drawing an altitude from the vertex angle.\n  \n- **Steps:**\n  1. Draw an altitude from the vertex angle \\(2x\\) to the base \\(\\cos 7x\\).\n  2. This splits the triangle into two congruent right triangles.\n  3. The altitude bisects the base and the vertex angle.\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - **Wait, that can't be right because...** the altitude doesn't necessarily bisect the base unless it's an equilateral triangle.\n  - But here, the triangle is isosceles, so it should bisect the base.\n  \n- **Proceeding:**\n  - Let's calculate the lengths involved.\n\n- **Calculations:**\n  - The base is \\(\\cos 7x\\), so each half is \\(\\frac{\\cos 7x}{2}\\).\n  - The altitude can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.\n  \n- **Setting Up:**\n  \\[\n  (\\cos x)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\cos 7x}{2}\\right)^2 + h^2\n  \\]\n  where \\(h\\) is the altitude.\n  \n- **Solving for \\(h\\):**\n  \\[\n  h^2 = (\\cos x)^2 - \\frac{(\\cos 7x)^2}{4}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  h = \\sqrt{(\\cos x)^2 - \\frac{(\\cos 7x)^2}{4}}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Checking:**\n  - **That number seems too big...** Wait, this is getting complicated again.\n  - Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\n**Conclusion:** This involves too many square roots and isn't leading to an easy solution. Let's try another approach.\n\n*It's okay to backtrack when realizing that the path is too complex or not fruitful.*\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 4: Using Trigonometric Identities**\n\n- **New Idea:** \n  - **Oh! This reminds me of...** using trigonometric identities to relate \\(\\cos x\\) and \\(\\cos 7x\\).\n  \n- **Thought Process:**\n  - Perhaps expressing \\(\\cos 7x\\) in terms of \\(\\cos x\\) using identities might help.\n  \n- **Recollection:**\n  - There's a multiple angle formula:\n    \\[\n    \\cos 7x = 64(\\cos x)^7 - 112(\\cos x)^5 + 56(\\cos x)^3 - 7\\cos x\n    \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - **Let me think about whether this approach makes sense...** This introduces a high-degree polynomial, which could be challenging to solve.\n  \n- **Proceeding:**\n  - Let's see if substituting this helps.\n  \n- **Substitution:**\n  \\[\n  \\cos 7x = 64(\\cos x)^7 - 112(\\cos x)^5 + 56(\\cos x)^3 - 7\\cos x\n  \\]\n  \n- **Setting Up Equation:**\n  \\[\n  \\cos 7x = \\cos 7x\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplification:**\n  - This doesn't really help.\n  - **Wait, that can't be right because...** it's tautological.\n\n**Conclusion:** This isn't leading anywhere. I need to find a better connection.\n\n*Recognizing that this path is circular and doesn't provide new information prompts me to reconsider my approach.*\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 5: Applying the Law of Cosines Differently**\n\n- **New Idea:** \n  - **Hmm, maybe I need to back up and try...** applying the Law of Cosines from a different perspective.\n  \n- **Thought Process:**\n  - Use the Law of Cosines on the triangle with sides \\(\\cos x, \\cos x, \\cos 7x\\) and vertex angle \\(2x\\).\n  \n- **Set Up:**\n  \\[\n  (\\cos 7x)^2 = (\\cos x)^2 + (\\cos x)^2 - 2(\\cos x)(\\cos x) \\cos(2x)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - **Wait, that can't be right because...** this is the same equation as before, which didn't help much.\n\n**Conclusion:** This reminds me of needing a different approach altogether.\n\n*It's important to acknowledge when repeating the same unsuccessful method and move on to a new idea.*\n\n---\n\n### **Final Strategy: Using Angle Relationships and Trigonometric Identities**\n\n- **New Idea:** \n  - **Oh! This reminds me of...** leveraging the fact that the vertex angle is \\(2x\\) and using trigonometric identities to relate the sides.\n  \n- **Thought Process:**\n  - Since the vertex angle is \\(2x\\), and the sides opposite the base angles are \\(\\cos x\\), maybe we can set up an equation involving \\(\\cos x\\) and \\(\\cos 7x\\).\n  \n- **Setting Up:**\n  - Consider the relationships between the angles and sides in the triangle.\n  \n- **Brainstorming:**\n  - The base angles are each \\(x\\).\n  - The sides opposite these angles are \\(\\cos x\\).\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - **Hmm, maybe I need to...** connect the side \\(\\cos 7x\\) with the angle \\(2x\\).\n  \n- **Proceeding:**\n  - Let's consider using the **Law of Cosines** again but in a more thoughtful way.\n\n*Introducing a fresh perspective by considering different trigonometric identities can often lead to breakthroughs.*\n\n---\n\n### **Applying Trigonometric Ratios**\n\n- **Thought Process:** \n  - If we drop an altitude from the vertex of the isosceles triangle, we obtain two right triangles.\n  - This reminds me of how right triangles can simplify relationships between angles and sides.\n  \n- **Steps:**\n  1. Draw an altitude from the vertex angle \\(2x\\) to the base \\(\\cos 7x\\).\n  2. This splits the isosceles triangle into two congruent right triangles.\n  3. In each right triangle, one of the angles is \\(x\\), the opposite side is \\(\\frac{\\cos 7x}{2}\\), and the hypotenuse is \\(\\cos x\\).\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - **Hmm, let me double-check my reasoning here...** Does this setup make sense?\n  - Yes, because dropping the altitude creates right triangles, which can be analyzed using basic trigonometry.\n\n*Validating the new approach ensures that the path forward is correct and logical.*\n\n---\n\n### **Applying Trigonometric Ratios**\n\n- **Thought Process:** \n  - In the right triangle, we can use the definition of sine:\n    \\[\n    \\sin x = \\frac{\\frac{\\cos 7x}{2}}{\\cos x} = \\frac{\\cos 7x}{2 \\cos x}\n    \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying:**\n  \\[\n    \\cos 7x = 2 \\sin x \\cos x = \\sin 2x\n    \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - **Oh! This reminds me of...** the double angle identity for sine: \\(\\sin(2x) = 2 \\sin x \\cos x\\).\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  - We have:\n    \\[\n    \\cos 7x = \\sin 2x\n    \\]\n  \n*Recognizing familiar identities can help simplify complex relationships and lead to a more straightforward solution.*\n\n---\n\n### **Setting Up the Equation**\n\n- **Thought Process:** \n  - Now, we have \\(\\cos 7x = \\sin 2x\\).\n  - This can be rewritten using complementary angles:\n    \\[\n    \\cos 7x = \\cos(90^\\circ - 2x)\n    \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - **Hmm, let me think about how to proceed...** Since the cosines of two angles are equal, their angles must either be congruent or differ by a multiple of \\(360^\\circ\\).\n  \n- **Proceeding:**\n  - This leads to two cases:\n    1. \\(7x = 90^\\circ - 2x + 360^\\circ k\\) for some integer \\(k\\)\n    2. \\(7x = -90^\\circ + 2x + 360^\\circ k\\) for some integer \\(k\\)\n\n*Breaking down the equation into cases helps in systematically exploring all possible solutions.*\n\n---\n\n### **Case 1: \\(7x = 90^\\circ - 2x + 360^\\circ k\\)**\n\n- **Solving for \\(x\\):**\n  \\[\n    7x + 2x = 90^\\circ + 360^\\circ k \\implies 9x = 90^\\circ + 360^\\circ k \\implies x = 10^\\circ + 40^\\circ k\n    \\]\n  \n- **Finding Acute Angles:**\n  - Since \\(x\\) must be acute (\\(0^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ\\)), we consider integer values of \\(k\\):\n    - For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = 10^\\circ\\)\n    - For \\(k = 1\\): \\(x = 50^\\circ\\)\n    - For \\(k = 2\\): \\(x = 90^\\circ\\) (but this is not acute)\n  \n- **Possible Values:**\n  - Therefore, from this case, the possible acute angles are \\(10^\\circ\\) and \\(50^\\circ\\).\n\n*Listing out the solutions for different integer values ensures that all possible angles are considered.*\n\n---\n\n### **Case 2: \\(7x = -90^\\circ + 2x + 360^\\circ k\\)**\n\n- **Solving for \\(x\\):**\n  \\[\n    7x - 2x = -90^\\circ + 360^\\circ k \\implies 5x = -90^\\circ + 360^\\circ k \\implies x = -18^\\circ + 72^\\circ k\n    \\]\n  \n- **Finding Acute Angles:**\n  - Again, considering integer values of \\(k\\) to keep \\(x\\) acute:\n    - For \\(k = 1\\): \\(x = 54^\\circ\\)\n    - For \\(k = 0\\): \\(x = -18^\\circ\\) (not valid as angles must be positive)\n    - For \\(k = 2\\): \\(x = 126^\\circ\\) (not acute)\n  \n- **Possible Values:**\n  - Thus, from this case, the valid acute angle is \\(54^\\circ\\).\n\n*Ensuring that only positive and acute angles are selected aligns with the problem's requirements.*\n\n---\n\n### **Combining Solutions**\n\n- **Thought Process:** \n  - Combining the valid acute angles from both cases, we have:\n    \\[\n    x = 10^\\circ, 50^\\circ, 54^\\circ\n    \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - **Actually, looking at this again...** I need to verify that these angles satisfy the original triangle conditions, especially considering the signs of \\(\\cos x\\) and \\(\\cos 7x\\).\n\n*It's crucial to validate the solutions against the original problem constraints to ensure their correctness.*\n\n---\n\n### **Validating the Solutions**\n\n#### **Checking \\(x = 10^\\circ\\):**\n\n- **Calculations:**\n  - \\(\\cos 10^\\circ > 0\\)\n  - \\(\\cos 70^\\circ > 0\\)\n  \n- **Triangle Sides:**\n  - All sides are positive, and the triangle inequality is satisfied.\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  - **This makes sense...** \\(x = 10^\\circ\\) is a valid solution.\n\n*Performing a quick check ensures that the solution is legitimate.*\n\n#### **Checking \\(x = 50^\\circ\\):**\n\n- **Calculations:**\n  - \\(\\cos 50^\\circ > 0\\)\n  - \\(\\cos 350^\\circ > 0\\) (since \\(350^\\circ = 360^\\circ - 10^\\circ\\))\n  \n- **Triangle Sides:**\n  - All sides are positive, and the triangle inequality holds.\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  - **This makes sense...** \\(x = 50^\\circ\\) is a valid solution.\n\n*Consistency across different angles reinforces the correctness of the approach.*\n\n#### **Checking \\(x = 54^\\circ\\):**\n\n- **Calculations:**\n  - \\(\\cos 54^\\circ > 0\\)\n  - \\(\\cos 378^\\circ = \\cos 18^\\circ > 0\\)\n  \n- **Triangle Sides:**\n  - All sides are positive, and the triangle inequality is satisfied.\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  - **This makes sense...** \\(x = 54^\\circ\\) is a valid solution.\n\n*Final verification ensures that all identified solutions are indeed valid.*\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Final Solution</ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n<\\text{ANSWER}> 10^\\circ, 50^\\circ, 54^\\circ </\\text{ANSWER}>\n\\]\n\n- **Recap:**\n  -
