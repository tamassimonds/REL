  "problem": "Four of the six numbers 1867, 1993, 2019, 2025, 2109, and 2121 have a mean (average) of 2008. What is the mean (average) of the other two numbers?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and ensure everything checks out before arriving at the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem involves six numbers, and we're told that four of them have an average of 2008. We need to find the average of the remaining two numbers.\n\n**Initial Idea:**  \nSince the average is the total sum divided by the number of items, I can start by calculating the sum of the four numbers with the given average. Then, I'll use that to find the sum of the remaining two numbers and their average.\n\nBut wait, there are six numbers in total. Maybe I need to find which specific four numbers contribute to that average and then determine the rest. This reminds me of problems where identifying the right components is crucial.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nTrying to identify which four numbers add up to the given average might be time-consuming. Perhaps there's a more straightforward approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate the Sum of the Four Numbers:**  \n   Use the given average to find the total sum of those four numbers.\n\n2. **Determine the Total Sum of All Six Numbers:**  \n   Add up all six numbers to know the complete sum.\n\n3. **Find the Sum of the Remaining Two Numbers:**  \n   Subtract the sum of the four numbers from the total sum.\n\n4. **Calculate the Average of the Remaining Two Numbers:**  \n   Divide the sum of the remaining two numbers by two.\n\n**Leaning Towards:**  \nCalculating the sum of the four numbers first seems like a solid starting point. Let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Sum of the Four Numbers**\n\nGiven:\n- Average of four numbers = 2008\n- Number of items = 4\n\n\\[ \\text{Sum of four numbers} = 2008 \\times 4 \\]\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n\\[ 2008 \\times 4 = 8032 \\]\n\n**Outcome:**  \nThe sum of the four numbers is 8032.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat was straightforward. Now, I need to confirm which four numbers add up to 8032, but maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Total Sum of All Six Numbers**\n\nLet's add up all six numbers:\n\nGiven Numbers:  \n1867, 1993, 2019, 2025, 2109, 2121\n\n\\[ \\text{Total sum} = 1867 + 1993 + 2019 + 2025 + 2109 + 2121 \\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n\\[ \n1867 + 1993 = 3860 \\\\\n3860 + 2019 = 5879 \\\\\n5879 + 2025 = 7904 \\\\\n7904 + 2109 = 10013 \\\\\n10013 + 2121 = 12134 \n\\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total sum} = 12,134 \\]\n\n**Outcome:**  \nThe total sum of all six numbers is 12,134.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAdding them up individually helps ensure accuracy. Now, I can proceed to find the sum of the remaining two numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Sum of the Remaining Two Numbers**\n\nNow that I have the total sum and the sum of the four numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sum of remaining two numbers} = \\text{Total sum} - \\text{Sum of four numbers} \\]\n\n\\[ 12,134 - 8,032 = 4,102 \\]\n\n**Outcome:**  \nThe sum of the remaining two numbers is 4,102.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense. By subtracting the sum of the four known numbers from the total, I get the sum of the remaining two. Everything checks out so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Average of the Remaining Two Numbers**\n\nFinally, to find the average of the remaining two numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of remaining two numbers}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{4,102}{2} = 2,051 \\]\n\n**Outcome:**  \nThe average of the remaining two numbers is 2,051.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDividing the sum by two gives a clean result, confirming that the calculations are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Verification**\n\nLet\u2019s quickly recap to ensure everything aligns:\n\n- **Sum of Four Numbers:**  \n  \\( 2008 \\times 4 = 8,032 \\) \u2714\n\n- **Total Sum of All Numbers:**  \n  \\( 12,134 \\) \u2714\n\n- **Sum of Remaining Two Numbers:**  \n  \\( 12,134 - 8,032 = 4,102 \\) \u2714\n\n- **Average of Remaining Two Numbers:**  \n  \\( \\frac{4,102}{2} = 2,051 \\) \u2714\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll steps lead consistently to the final answer. The average of the remaining two numbers is **2,051**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**  \n   - Identified that the average of four out of six numbers is given.\n   - Needed to find the average of the remaining two numbers.\n\n2. **Strategizing:**  \n   - Decided to calculate the sum of the four numbers using the given average.\n   - Calculated the total sum of all six numbers.\n   - Determined the sum of the remaining two numbers by subtraction.\n\n3. **Execution:**  \n   - Performed step-by-step calculations to ensure accuracy.\n   - Verified each step before proceeding to the next.\n\n4. **Reflection and Verification:**  \n   - Continuously checked each part of the process to confirm correctness.\n   - Made adjustments as necessary to maintain accuracy.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**  \n   - The average of the remaining two numbers is **2,051**.\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically, brainstorming different strategies, and reflecting on each step, I ensured the solution was accurate and complete.",
  "ground_truth": "The sum of the six given integers is $1867+1993+2019+2025+2109+2121=12134$.\n\nThe four of these integers that have a mean of 2008 must have a sum of $4(2008)=8032$.  (We do not know which integers they are, but we do not actually need to know.)\n\nThus, the sum of the remaining two integers must be $12134-8032=4102$.\n\nTherefore, the mean of the remaining two integers is $\\frac{4102}{2}=\\boxed{2051}$.\n\n(We can verify that 1867, 2019, 2025 and 2121 do actually have a mean of 2008, and that 1993 and 2109 have a mean of 2051.)"
