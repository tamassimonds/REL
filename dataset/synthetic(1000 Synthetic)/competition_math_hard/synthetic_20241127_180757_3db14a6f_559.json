  "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $a^{-1}$ is undefined $\\pmod{55}$ and $a^{-1}$ is also undefined $\\pmod{66}$?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem again. I'll keep my original approach but be more careful with my reasoning, making adjustments as I notice where I went off track. Let's dive in step by step, just like how I'd naturally work through it.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the question asks for the smallest positive integer \\( a \\) such that \\( a^{-1} \\) is undefined modulo 55 and modulo 66. This reminds me of modular inverses, where an inverse exists if and only if \\( a \\) is coprime with the modulus. So, if \\( a^{-1} \\) is undefined, \\( a \\) must share a factor with the modulus.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Maybe \\( a \\) needs to share factors with both 55 and 66?**\n- Or perhaps \\( a \\) must be a multiple of their common factors?\n- Should I consider the prime factorization of 55 and 66 to see what's common?\n\nI'm not entirely sure which path to take yet, but exploring these ideas might help.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me start by breaking down 55 and 66 into their prime factors to see what's common.\n\n- \\( 55 = 5 \\times 11 \\)\n- \\( 66 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 11 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI notice that both 55 and 66 share the prime factor 11. This could be important because if \\( a \\) shares a prime factor with the modulus, then the inverse doesn't exist.\n\n**Checking If This Helps:**\n\nSo, perhaps \\( a \\) needs to be a multiple of 11 to ensure \\( a^{-1} \\) is undefined for both moduli. But is that enough? Let me think...\n\n**Hmm... Wait:**\n\nActually, looking at this again, just being a multiple of 11 might not be sufficient. For \\( a^{-1} \\) to be undefined modulo both 55 and 66, \\( a \\) must share factors with both moduli.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Considering the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAn integer \\( a \\) has an inverse modulo \\( n \\) if and only if \\(\\gcd(a, n) = 1\\). Therefore, to have \\( a^{-1} \\) undefined modulo both 55 and 66, we need:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a, 55) > 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\gcd(a, 66) > 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis means \\( a \\) must share factors with both 55 and 66. Specifically, \\( a \\) must be divisible by factors of both moduli.\n\n**Hmm, Let Me Double-Check:**\n\nSo, \\( a \\) needs to be divisible by at least one prime factor of 55 and at least one prime factor of 66. Let's list them:\n\n- Factors of 55: 5, 11\n- Factors of 66: 2, 3, 11\n\nWait a minute, 11 is common to both. But there are other factors too. I need to consider all possibilities to ensure \\( a \\) doesn't have an inverse for both moduli.\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Identifying the Smallest \\( a \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to find the smallest \\( a \\) that is divisible by:\n\n- Either 5 or 11 (to make \\( a^{-1} \\) undefined modulo 55)\n- And either 2, 3, or 11 (to make \\( a^{-1} \\) undefined modulo 66)\n\n**Calculating the Smallest \\( a \\):**\n\nLet me try to find the smallest such \\( a \\).\n\n**Exploring Different Values:**\n\n- \\( a = 5 \\):  \n  - \\(\\gcd(5, 55) = 5 > 1\\) \u2192 Inverse undefined modulo 55  \n  - \\(\\gcd(5, 66) = 1\\) \u2192 Inverse exists modulo 66  \n  - **Conclusion:** Does not satisfy both conditions.\n\n- \\( a = 6 \\):  \n  - \\(\\gcd(6, 55) = 1\\) \u2192 Inverse exists modulo 55  \n  - \\(\\gcd(6, 66) = 6 > 1\\) \u2192 Inverse undefined modulo 66  \n  - **Conclusion:** Does not satisfy both conditions.\n\n- \\( a = 10 \\):  \n  - \\(\\gcd(10, 55) = 5 > 1\\) \u2192 Inverse undefined modulo 55  \n  - \\(\\gcd(10, 66) = 2 > 1\\) \u2192 Inverse undefined modulo 66  \n  - **Conclusion:** Satisfies both conditions.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOh! This reminds me of... Wait, I initially focused only on the common factor 11, but I see now that \\( a \\) could be smaller by considering other factors. \\( a = 10 \\) works because it's divisible by 5 (affecting modulo 55) and 2 (affecting modulo 66).\n\n**Double Checking:**\n\nLet me verify:\n\n- **Modulo 55:**  \n  \\(\\gcd(10, 55) = 5\\), so \\( a^{-1} \\) is undefined.\n\n- **Modulo 66:**  \n  \\(\\gcd(10, 66) = 2\\), so \\( a^{-1} \\) is undefined.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied, \\( a = 10 \\) is indeed the smallest such integer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThe smallest positive integer \\( a \\) such that \\( a^{-1} \\) is undefined modulo 55 and modulo 66 is **10**.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThis problem required careful consideration of the conditions under which a modular inverse is undefined. Initially, I focused on the common factor 11, but upon re-evaluating, I realized that considering other factors like 5 and 2 led me to a smaller \\( a \\). By systematically checking smaller integers and ensuring that \\( a \\) shares factors with both moduli, I arrived at the correct answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThrough exploring different strategies, including prime factorization and evaluating the greatest common divisors, I determined that \\( a = 10 \\) is the smallest integer that makes the inverse undefined for both moduli. Reflecting on each step and adjusting my approach when necessary ensured that the solution was both correct and optimal.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThe smallest positive integer \\( a \\) such that \\( a^{-1} \\) is undefined modulo 55 and modulo 66 is **10**.  \n</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "An integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{55}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,55)=1$. Similarly, an integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{66}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,66)=1$.\n\nSince we're looking for an integer that doesn't have an inverse modulo either $55$ or $66$, we want $a$ such that $\\gcd(a,55)>1$ and $\\gcd(a,66)>1$. Thus $a$ must be divisible by either $5$ or $11$, and $a$ must also be divisible by either $2$, $3$, or $11$. The smallest positive integer that satisfies both properties is $\\boxed{10}$."
