  "problem": "What is the greatest integer less than 100 for which the greatest common factor of that integer and 18 is 3?",
  "solution": "Certainly! Let's transform the brainstorming process into a coherent, concise solution while preserving the original thinking and steps.\n\n---\n\n## **Complete Solution**\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the greatest integer less than 100 whose greatest common factor (GCF) with 18 is exactly 3.\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nInitially, this problem reminds me of factors and divisibility. The GCF being 3 implies that the number must share 3 as a factor with 18 but not any higher common factors. This leads me to consider the factors of 18 and how they relate to numbers less than 100.\n\n### **Possible Strategies**\n\n1. **List Multiples of 3:** Since the GCF is 3, the number must be divisible by 3.\n2. **Exclude Higher Multiples:** Ensure the number is not divisible by 6, 9, or 18 to keep the GCF exactly 3.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Approach**\n\n#### **Step 1: List Multiples of 3 Less Than 100**\n\n\\[\n3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99\n\\]\n\n#### **Step 2: Filter Out Multiples of 6, 9, and 18**\n\nTo ensure the GCF is exactly 3, we must exclude numbers that are also divisible by 6, 9, or 18, as these would increase the GCF beyond 3.\n\n#### **Step 3: Focus on the Largest Multiples Near 100**\n\nInstead of checking all multiples, let's start with the largest ones and work our way down.\n\n- **99:** Divisible by 9 \u2192 GCF with 18 is 9\n- **96:** Divisible by 6 \u2192 GCF with 18 is 6\n- **93:** Divisible by 3 only \u2192 GCF with 18 is 3\n\n#### **Step 4: Verify the Candidate**\n\n**Checking 93:**\n\n- **Divisible by 3:** Yes\n- **Not Divisible by 6, 9, or 18:** Yes\n\nTherefore, the GCF of 93 and 18 is exactly 3.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter systematically evaluating the largest multiples of 3 less than 100 and ensuring they aren't divisible by higher factors of 18, we find that **93** is the greatest integer satisfying the condition.\n\n---\n\n**<ANSWER> Solution**\n\nThe greatest integer less than 100 for which the greatest common factor with 18 is 3 is **93**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy carefully filtering out multiples that would increase the GCF beyond 3 and focusing on the largest eligible numbers, we efficiently arrived at the correct answer. This method ensures accuracy by verifying each step and confirming that no larger number meets the criteria.",
  "ground_truth": "The prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3. If the greatest common factor with 18 is 3, that means the other number is a multiple of 3 but not 2, 6, or 9. Since the other number cannot be an even number (multiple of 2), we start with 99 and look at decreasing odd numbers. 99 is a multiple of 9, 97 and 95 are not multiples of 3, so the greatest integer less than 100 that satisfies the conditions is $\\boxed{93}$."
