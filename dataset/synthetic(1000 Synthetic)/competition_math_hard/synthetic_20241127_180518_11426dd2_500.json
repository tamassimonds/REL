Three vertices of the rectangle are given: \\((5, 11)\\), \\((16, 11)\\), and \\((16, -2)\\). There's also a circle with the equation \\((x - 5)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 9\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This reminds me of geometry problems involving overlapping shapes.\n- I need to visualize how the rectangle and circle intersect.\n- I\u2019m thinking about possibly drawing the shapes to get a better idea.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Determine the Fourth Vertex:** Since it's a rectangle, finding the missing vertex could help in understanding its full shape.\n2. **Calculate the Rectangle's Area:** Knowing the area might help, although the question asks for the intersection area.\n3. **Analyze the Circle's Position:** See how the circle's center and radius relate to the rectangle.\n4. **Find Points of Intersection:** Possibly calculate where the circle and rectangle overlap.\n5. **Use Integration or Geometry Theorems:** Maybe use calculus or geometric properties to find the intersection area.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Determining the Fourth Vertex of the Rectangle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since three vertices are given, I can figure out the fourth vertex by understanding the properties of a rectangle (opposite sides are equal and parallel).\n\n**Given Vertices:**\n- \\((5, 11)\\), \\((16, 11)\\), \\((16, -2)\\)\\)\n\n**Observations:**\n- Two vertices share the same \\(y\\)-coordinate \\((11)\\), so they form a horizontal side.\n- The vertical side connects \\((16, 11)\\) and \\((16, -2)\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- The missing vertex should complete the rectangle by connecting to \\((5, 11)\\) and \\((16, -2)\\).\n- So, the fourth vertex is \\((5, -2)\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Do the sides match up? Yes, we have:\n  - Horizontal sides: \\((5, 11)\\) to \\((16, 11)\\) and \\((5, -2)\\) to \\((16, -2)\\)\n  - Vertical sides: \\((16, 11)\\) to \\((16, -2)\\) and \\((5, 11)\\) to \\((5, -2)\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This makes sense. The rectangle is aligned with the axes, which might simplify things later.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Visualizing the Rectangle and Circle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to understand how the rectangle and circle overlap.\n- Drawing a rough sketch could help to see if the circle intersects the rectangle's sides and where.\n\n**Circle's Equation:**\n- \\((x - 5)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 9\\)\n- **Interpretation:** This is a circle centered at \\((5, -2)\\) with a radius of 3.\n\n**Observations:**\n- The circle's center is at the bottom-left corner of the rectangle.\n- Since the radius is 3, the circle extends 3 units in all directions from its center.\n\n**Sketch Thoughts:**\n- The circle might overlap the bottom-left corner of the rectangle.\n- The intersection area would likely be part of the circle that lies inside the rectangle.\n\n**Initial Strategy:**\n- Find out which parts of the circle lie within the rectangle.\n- Determine if the circle intersects the rectangle's sides and calculate the corresponding area.\n\n**Check:**\n- Does the circle extend beyond the rectangle? \n  - **To the right:** Up to \\(x = 8\\) \\((5 + 3)\\)\n  - **Upward:** Up to \\(y = 1\\) \\((-2 + 3)\\)\n  - The rectangle extends from \\(x = 5\\) to \\(16\\) and \\(y = -2\\) to \\(11\\), so the circle is entirely within the rectangle horizontally but intersects vertically at \\(y = 1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- It seems like the circle only intersects the rectangle along the bottom-left corner.\n- This simplifies the problem since the circle doesn't exceed the rectangle's boundaries horizontally.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Area of Intersection**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The intersection is likely a quarter-circle since the circle's center aligns with the rectangle's corner.\n- Need to confirm if it's exactly a quarter-circle or if there's more to consider.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Calculate the Area of a Quarter-Circle:** If the intersection is exactly a quarter-circle, this would be straightforward.\n2. **Use Integration:** If the intersection is more complex, integrating the circle's equation over the appropriate bounds might be necessary.\n3. **Symmetry Considerations:** Assess if symmetry can simplify the calculations.\n\n**Initial Check:**\n- Does the circle intersect the rectangle only at the bottom-left corner? \n  - Yes, because the circle's radius is 3, and the rectangle extends further in all directions from the circle's center.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This suggests that the intersection area is indeed a quarter-circle.\n\n**Proceeding with Strategy 1:**\n- Calculate the area of a quarter-circle with radius 3.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n\\text{Area of full circle} = \\pi \\times r^2 = \\pi \\times 3^2 = 9\\pi\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Area of quarter-circle} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 9\\pi = \\frac{9\\pi}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this make sense? \n  - Yes, since the circle is entirely within the rectangle except at the bottom-left corner, and only a quarter of the circle lies inside the rectangle.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The calculation aligns with the visual sketch and initial observations.\n- The intersection area is a quarter-circle with radius 3.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before finalizing the answer, I need to ensure that no other parts of the circle intersect the rectangle.\n- Double-checking the coordinates and dimensions to confirm the intersection area.\n\n**Verification:**\n- The circle's center is at \\((5, -2)\\), and the radius is 3.\n- The rectangle extends from \\(x = 5\\) to \\(16\\) and \\(y = -2\\) to \\(11\\).\n- The circle touches the rectangle only at the bottom-left corner.\n\n**Check:**\n- Horizontally, the circle extends from \\(x = 2\\) to \\(8\\) \\((5 \\pm 3)\\).\n- Vertically, it extends from \\(y = -5\\) to \\(1\\) \\((-2 \\pm 3)\\).\n- Since the rectangle's boundaries are beyond these limits, the circle does not intersect elsewhere.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The initial assumption holds true.\n- The intersection is solely the quarter-circle at the bottom-left corner.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Final Answer**\n\n**<ANSWER> solution**\n\nThe area of the intersection is \\(\\frac{9\\pi}{4}\\).\n\n**First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem step by step.
