  "solution": "Absolutely, let's put all the pieces together into a coherent and complete solution. I'll maintain the original thought process while ensuring clarity and flow. Here's how it goes:\n\n---\n\n### **First Impressions**\n\nAlright, let's dive back into the problem with a fresh perspective:\n\n> **Question:**  \n> Suppose \\( a < 0 \\) and \\( a < b < c \\). Which of the following must be true?  \n>  \n> - **A.** \\( ab < bc \\)  \n> - **B.** \\( ac < bc \\)  \n> - **C.** \\( ab < ac \\)  \n> - **D.** \\( a + b < b + c \\)  \n> - **E.** \\( \\frac{c}{a} < 1 \\)  \n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nHmm, we have three numbers with \\( a \\) being negative and \\( a < b < c \\). The options involve multiplication, addition, and division. This reminds me of how negative numbers interact with inequalities\u2014especially how multiplying or dividing by negatives can flip inequalities.\n\n**Strategies Brainstorm:**  \n1. **Evaluate Each Statement Individually:**  \n   Assess whether each option holds true under the given conditions.\n\n2. **Use Specific Examples:**  \n   Plug in sample values to see if the inequalities are satisfied.\n\n3. **Apply General Algebraic Properties:**  \n   Utilize rules of inequalities, particularly with negative numbers.\n\nI think starting with specific examples might help build intuition, but I'll need to confirm with general properties to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluating Statement A - \\( ab < bc \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nGiven \\( a < 0 \\), and \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) are positive with \\( b < c \\), I need to see how multiplying \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) by \\( a \\) affects the inequality.\n\n**Initial Approach:**  \nStart with \\( b < c \\).  \nMultiply both sides by \\( a \\) (which is negative):  \n\\[ ab > ac \\]\n\n**Wait a Minute...**  \nThe statement asks if \\( ab < bc \\), but my initial calculation compares \\( ab \\) and \\( ac \\). I need to rethink this.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nActually, I should compare \\( ab \\) and \\( bc \\). Let's express \\( bc \\) as multiplying \\( b \\) by \\( c \\), both positive.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nConsider that \\( ab \\) involves multiplying a negative \\( a \\) by \\( b \\), and \\( bc \\) is the product of two positives.\n\n**Sample Solution Insight:**  \nOh! Looking at this again, if \\( b \\) is negative and \\( c \\) is positive, then \\( ab \\) becomes positive, and \\( bc \\) is negative. So, \\( ab < bc \\) does not always hold.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nBy considering different signs for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\), it's clear that **Statement A is not always true**.\n\n**<ANSWER>** Statement A does not always hold. **</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating Statement B - \\( ac < bc \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, comparing \\( ac \\) and \\( bc \\). Since \\( a < 0 \\) and \\( b < c \\), let's see how this plays out.\n\n**Initial Calculation:**  \nStarting with \\( b < c \\),  \nMultiply both sides by \\( a \\) (negative):  \n\\[ ac > bc \\]\n\n**Wait...**  \nBut the statement claims \\( ac < bc \\). Hmm, something seems off here.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nActually, looking at it again, if \\( a \\) is negative and \\( c \\) is positive, then \\( ac \\) is negative. Meanwhile, \\( bc \\) involves multiplying \\( b \\) and \\( c \\), which could be negative or positive depending on \\( b \\)'s sign.\n\n**Sample Solution Insight:**  \nIf all three variables are negative, \\( ac > bc \\), making the statement false. Alternatively, if \\( b \\) is negative and \\( c \\) is positive, \\( ac \\) is negative and \\( bc \\) is negative, but \\( ac < bc \\) does not necessarily hold.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTherefore, **Statement B is not always true**.\n\n**<ANSWER>** Statement B does not always hold. **</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluating Statement C - \\( ab < ac \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's compare \\( ab \\) and \\( ac \\). Given \\( b < c \\) and \\( a < 0 \\), let's see how this affects the inequality.\n\n**Initial Calculation:**  \nStarting with \\( b < c \\),  \nMultiply both sides by \\( a \\) (negative):  \n\\[ ab > ac \\]\n\n**Hmm...**  \nThe statement suggests \\( ab < ac \\), but my calculation shows the opposite.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nActually, considering specific cases, if \\( b \\) is negative and \\( c \\) is positive, \\( ab \\) becomes positive, and \\( ac \\) is negative. Thus, \\( ab < ac \\) is not always true.\n\n**Sample Solution Insight:**  \nBy considering different signs for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\), it's evident that **Statement C is not always true**.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Statement C does not hold.**\n\n**<ANSWER>** Statement C does not hold. **</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluating Statement D - \\( a + b < b + c \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis inequality suggests that adding \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) results in a smaller sum than adding \\( c \\) to \\( b \\). Given \\( a < b < c \\), this seems intuitive.\n\n**Initial Calculation:**  \nStarting with \\( a < c \\),  \nAdd \\( b \\) to both sides:  \n\\[ a + b < b + c \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis inequality straightforwardly holds because \\( a < c \\). Adding \\( b \\) to both sides maintains the inequality.\n\n**Sample Solution Insight:**  \nSubtracting \\( b \\) from both sides leads to \\( a < c \\), which is true by the given conditions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Statement D is always true.**\n\n**<ANSWER>** Statement D is always true. **</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Evaluating Statement E - \\( \\frac{c}{a} < 1 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis involves division, which can be tricky with negatives. Given \\( a < 0 \\) and \\( a < c \\), I need to see how \\( \\frac{c}{a} \\) compares to 1.\n\n**Initial Calculation:**  \nStarting with \\( a < c \\),  \nDivide both sides by \\( a \\) (negative), which flips the inequality:  \n\\[ \\frac{c}{a} > 1 \\]\n\n**Wait a Second...**  \nThe statement claims \\( \\frac{c}{a} < 1 \\), but my calculation shows \\( \\frac{c}{a} > 1 \\). This indicates a discrepancy.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nActually, looking at this again, if \\( c \\) is positive and \\( a \\) is negative, \\( \\frac{c}{a} \\) becomes negative. Comparing \\( \\frac{c}{a} \\) to 1 requires careful consideration of signs.\n\n**Sample Solution Insight:**  \nIf \\( c \\) is positive, then \\( \\frac{c}{a} \\) is negative, and thus \\( \\frac{c}{a} < 1 \\). Similarly, if \\( c \\) is negative and \\( a < c < 0 \\), \\( \\frac{c}{a} \\) is positive but still less than 1.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nTherefore, **Statement E is always true**.\n\n**<ANSWER>** Statement E is always true. **</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Check**\n\n**Quick Review:**  \n- **Statement A:** \\( ab < bc \\) \u2192 **Does not hold**  \n- **Statement B:** \\( ac < bc \\) \u2192 **Does not hold**  \n- **Statement C:** \\( ab < ac \\) \u2192 **Does not hold**  \n- **Statement D:** \\( a + b < b + c \\) \u2192 **Always true**  \n- **Statement E:** \\( \\frac{c}{a} < 1 \\) \u2192 **Always true**  \n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nAfter reassessing each statement and incorporating insights from specific examples, it's clear that only **Statements D and E** are always true under the given conditions.\n\n**<ANSWER>**  \n**Solution:** D, E  \n**<ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully evaluating each option and considering different scenarios, including the signs of \\( b \\) and \\( c \\), I realized that my initial assessment overlooked certain cases. Correcting these insights led me to the correct answer: Only **Statements D and E** are always true.\n\n---\n\nAnd there we have it! By methodically working through each statement, reflecting on initial missteps, and adjusting strategies, we've arrived at a complete and correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "Consider a negative $b$ and a positive $c$. Then $ab$ is positive and $bc$ is negative, and hence this is not true.\nIf we consider negative numbers for all three variables, $ac>bc$, and hence this is not true.\nConsider a negative $b$ and a positive $c$. Then $ab$ is positive and $ac$ is negative, hence this is not true.\nSubtracting $b$ from both sides gives us $a<c$ which we know is true.\nIf $c$ is positive then $c/a$ is negative and $c/a < 1$. If $c$ is negative, then $a<c<0$ which means $c/a < 1$.\n\nThus, $\\boxed{D, E}$ are always true."
