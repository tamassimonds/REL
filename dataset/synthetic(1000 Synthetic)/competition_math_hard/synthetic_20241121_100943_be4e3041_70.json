  "solution": "Certainly! Let's take the initial working out and refine it into a coherent, complete solution. We'll maintain the original thought process while ensuring clarity and smooth transitions, making it easier for the reader to follow along.\n\n---\n\n## **Understanding the Question**\n\n---\n\nWe have a cube with a side length of 6, and its vertices are alternately colored black and purple. The task is to find the volume of a tetrahedron whose corners are the purple vertices of the cube.\n\n- **Initial Thoughts:**  \n  This reminds me of geometric problems involving volumes, particularly using coordinates and symmetry. The alternating colors likely help identify the specific vertices forming the tetrahedron.\n\n- **Hmm Moment:**  \n  Wait, alternate coloring implies a specific pattern in the cube's vertices. I need to visualize which vertices are purple to see how they form a tetrahedron.\n\n---\n\n## **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n---\n\nLet's explore different approaches to tackle this problem:\n\n1. **Coordinate Geometry:**  \n   Assign coordinates to the cube's vertices and identify the purple ones. Use determinants to calculate the volume.\n\n2. **Symmetry and Proportionality:**  \n   Leverage the cube's symmetry to relate the tetrahedron's volume to the cube's volume.\n\n3. **Visualizing the Tetrahedron:**  \n   Attempt to draw or mentally map the connections between the purple vertices. Use geometric properties like edge lengths and angles.\n\n**Initial Preference:**  \nAssigning coordinates seems straightforward, so I'll start there. However, I'll keep symmetry in mind as a backup in case it gets too complicated.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Assigning Coordinates to the Cube**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo make things concrete, let's assign coordinates to the cube. A cube centered at the origin with a side length of 6 will have its vertices at \\((\\pm3, \\pm3, \\pm3)\\).\n\n- **Cube Coordinates:**  \n  \\[\n  (3, 3, 3),\\ (3, 3, -3),\\ (3, -3, 3),\\ (3, -3, -3),\\ \n  (-3, 3, 3),\\ (-3, 3, -3),\\ (-3, -3, 3),\\ (-3, -3, -3)\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIs this the best way? Since the cube is centered, using the origin simplifies calculations. I'll stick with this approach for now.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Identifying Purple Vertices**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to determine which vertices are colored purple. Given the alternate coloring, I can assume that vertices with an even number of negative coordinates are purple.\n\n- **Assigning Colors:**  \n  - Vertices with an even number of negative signs: **Purple**\n  - Vertices with an odd number of negative signs: **Black**\n\n**Listing Purple Vertices:**  \n\\[\n(3, 3, 3),\\ (3, -3, -3),\\ (-3, 3, -3),\\ (-3, -3, 3)\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, each of these vertices has an even number of negative coordinates, confirming they are purple.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Visualizing the Tetrahedron**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's see how these purple vertices connect to form a tetrahedron.\n\n- **Vertices of the Tetrahedron:**  \n  \\[\n  A = (3, 3, 3),\\ B = (3, -3, -3),\\ C = (-3, 3, -3),\\ D = (-3, -3, 3)\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThese vertices are diagonally opposite in pairs, which might simplify volume calculations later.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Calculating the Volume Using Determinants**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo find the volume of the tetrahedron, I can use the determinant of a matrix created from the position vectors of the vertices.\n\n- **Volume Formula:**  \n  \\[\n  V = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\left| \\det \\begin{bmatrix}\n  x_2 - x_1 & x_3 - x_1 & x_4 - x_1 \\\\\n  y_2 - y_1 & y_3 - y_1 & y_4 - y_1 \\\\\n  z_2 - z_1 & z_3 - z_1 & z_4 - z_1\n  \\end{bmatrix} \\right|\n  \\]\n\n**Assigning Coordinates:**  \nLet\u2019s choose \\( A = (3, 3, 3) \\) as our reference point and subtract it from the other vertices:\n\n- \\( B - A = (0, -6, -6) \\)\n- \\( C - A = (-6, 0, -6) \\)\n- \\( D - A = (-6, -6, 0) \\)\n\n**Constructing the Matrix:**  \n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & -6 & -6 \\\\\n-6 & 0 & -6 \\\\\n-6 & -6 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating Determinant:**  \n\\[\n\\det = \n(0)(0)(0) + (-6)(-6)(-6) + (-6)(-6)(-6) \n- (-6)(-6)(0) - (-6)(0)(-6) - (0)(-6)(-6)\n= -216 - 216 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = -432\n\\]\n\n**Volume Calculation:**  \n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{6} \\times | -432 | = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 432 = 72\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this result make sense? Given the cube's size, a volume of 72 cubic units for the tetrahedron seems plausible.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Validating the Approach with Symmetry**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s double-check using a different method to ensure accuracy. Utilizing the cube's symmetry can provide a more intuitive understanding.\n\n- **Alternative Method:**  \n  The tetrahedron is one of the regular tetrahedra inscribed in the cube, and its volume is related to the cube's volume.\n\n- **Cube\u2019s Volume:**  \n  \\[\n  V_{\\text{cube}} = 6^3 = 216\n  \\]\n\n- **Proportional Volume:**  \n  The tetrahedron occupies a specific fraction of the cube's volume. From geometric properties, this fraction is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n- **Calculating Volume:**  \n  \\[\n  V_{\\text{tetrahedron}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times V_{\\text{cube}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 216 = 72\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth methods agree, which confirms the correctness of the solution. This cross-validation strengthens the confidence in the final answer.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>\n\nThe volume of the tetrahedron whose corners are the purple vertices of the cube is **72 cubic units**.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, assigning coordinates, calculating volumes, and validating through symmetry, we've arrived at a consistent and correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "The volume of any pyramid is $\\frac 13$ the product of the base area and the height. However, determining the height of the purple tetrahedron is somewhat tricky! Instead of doing that, we observe that the total volume of the cube consists of the purple tetrahedron and four other \"clear\" tetrahedra. Each clear tetrahedron is formed by one of the black vertices of the cube together with its three purple neighbors. The clear tetrahedra are convenient to work with because they have lots of right angles.\n\nEach clear tetrahedron has an isosceles right triangular base of area $\\frac 12\\cdot 6\\cdot 6 = 18$, with corresponding height $6$ (a side of the cube). Thus, each clear tetrahedron has volume $\\frac 13\\cdot 18\\cdot 6 = 36$.\n\nThe cube has volume $6^3 = 216$. The volume of the purple tetrahedron is equal to the volume of the cube minus the volume of the four clear tetrahedra. This is $216 - 4\\cdot 36 = \\boxed{72}$."
