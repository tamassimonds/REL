  "solution": "Sure, let's present the solution in a smooth, coherent manner while preserving the original thought process. I'll ensure it reads naturally and flows logically, just like how someone would genuinely work through the problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We're given two functions:\n\n\\[\ng(x) = 3f^{-1}(x) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(x) = \\frac{24}{x + 3}\n\\]\n\nAnd the task is to find the value of \\( x \\) for which \\( g(x) = 15 \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- At first glance, this looks like a problem involving inverse functions.\n- I remember that \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is the inverse of \\( f(x) \\), meaning applying \\( f \\) and then \\( f^{-1} \\) should return the original input.\n- My initial thought is to find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) and use it in the equation for \\( g(x) \\).\n- But wait, maybe there's another way to tackle this. Perhaps expressing \\( g(x) \\) directly in terms of \\( f(x) \\) could work too. I'll keep both strategies in mind.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\):** Calculate the inverse of \\( f(x) \\) and substitute it into \\( g(x) = 15 \\).\n2. **Express \\( g(x) \\) in Terms of \\( f(x) \\):** See if I can relate \\( g(x) \\) directly to \\( f(x) \\) without explicitly finding the inverse.\n3. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Relationships:** Use the given equations to set up a system and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nI'm inclined to start with the first strategy\u2014finding \\( f^{-1}(x) \\)\u2014but I'll keep the other strategies in mind in case I encounter any issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), I need to express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) from the original function \\( f \\).\n- This reminds me of the standard procedure for finding inverses: swap \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) and solve for \\( y \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. Start with the original function:\n\n   \\[\n   f(x) = \\frac{24}{x + 3}\n   \\]\n\n2. Replace \\( f(x) \\) with \\( y \\):\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{24}{x + 3}\n   \\]\n\n3. Swap \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to find the inverse:\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{24}{y + 3}\n   \\]\n\n4. Solve for \\( y \\):\n\n   - Multiply both sides by \\( y + 3 \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n     \\[\n     x(y + 3) = 24\n     \\]\n\n   - Expand the left side:\n\n     \\[\n     xy + 3x = 24\n     \\]\n\n   - Isolate \\( y \\):\n\n     \\[\n     xy = 24 - 3x\n     \\]\n\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{24 - 3x}{x}\n     \\]\n\n5. Therefore, the inverse function is:\n\n   \\[\n   f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{24 - 3x}{x}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This seems correct, but let me do a quick check.\n- If I plug \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) back into \\( f(x) \\), I should get \\( x \\):\n\n  \\[\n  f\\left(f^{-1}(x)\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{24 - 3x}{x}\\right) = \\frac{24}{\\left(\\frac{24 - 3x}{x}\\right) + 3}\n  \\]\n  \n  Simplifying:\n\n  \\[\n  f\\left(f^{-1}(x)\\right) = \\frac{24}{\\frac{24 - 3x + 3x}{x}} = \\frac{24}{\\frac{24}{x}} = x\n  \\]\n  \n- Okay, that checks out. So, the inverse function is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) into \\( g(x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), I can substitute it into the equation for \\( g(x) \\):\n\n  \\[\n  g(x) = 3f^{-1}(x) = 3 \\times \\frac{24 - 3x}{x}\n  \\]\n  \n- But wait, this looks a bit messy. Maybe I should simplify it before proceeding.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. Substitute \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) into \\( g(x) \\):\n\n   \\[\n   g(x) = 3 \\times \\frac{24 - 3x}{x} = \\frac{3(24 - 3x)}{x}\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the expression:\n\n   \\[\n   g(x) = \\frac{72 - 9x}{x}\n   \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- Hmm, this simplifies nicely. Now I have \\( g(x) \\) in terms of \\( x \\).\n- The next step would be to set \\( g(x) = 15 \\) and solve for \\( x \\).\n- This feels like the right direction, but I want to make sure I haven't made any algebraic errors.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Let me plug in a sample value for \\( x \\) to see if both sides match.\n- Suppose \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n  \\[\n  g(2) = \\frac{72 - 9(2)}{2} = \\frac{72 - 18}{2} = \\frac{54}{2} = 27\n  \\]\n  \n- Wait, but we're looking for \\( g(x) = 15 \\), so \\( x = 2 \\) isn't the solution, but it confirms that the expression for \\( g(x) \\) works.\n- Alright, I think I can proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up the Equation \\( g(x) = 15 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, I'll set \\( g(x) = 15 \\) and solve for \\( x \\):\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{72 - 9x}{x} = 15\n  \\]\n  \n- This is a rational equation, and I can solve it by cross-multiplying to eliminate the denominator.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. Cross-multiply to get rid of the denominator:\n\n   \\[\n   72 - 9x = 15x\n   \\]\n  \n2. Move all terms involving \\( x \\) to one side:\n\n   \\[\n   72 = 15x + 9x\n   \\]\n  \n   \\[\n   72 = 24x\n   \\]\n  \n3. Divide both sides by 24 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{72}{24} = 3\n   \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wow, that was straightforward. But is it correct?\n- Let me double-check by substituting \\( x = 3 \\) back into the original functions to see if \\( g(x) = 15 \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- First, find \\( f^{-1}(3) \\):\n\n  \\[\n  f^{-1}(3) = \\frac{24 - 3(3)}{3} = \\frac{24 - 9}{3} = \\frac{15}{3} = 5\n  \\]\n  \n- Then, calculate \\( g(3) \\):\n\n  \\[\n  g(3) = 3 \\times f^{-1}(3) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n  \\]\n  \n- Perfect! It matches the given condition \\( g(x) = 15 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Expressing \\( g(x) \\) in Terms of \\( f(x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let me try another strategy to ensure the correctness of the solution.\n- What if I express \\( g(x) \\) directly in terms of \\( f(x) \\) without finding the inverse?\n- But looking at the given relationships, it seems tricky to relate \\( g(x) \\) to \\( f(x) \\) without involving the inverse.\n- Hmm, maybe this isn't the most efficient approach. I think the first method is more straightforward.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Sometimes, exploring alternative methods can provide insights or confirm the correctness of the initial approach.\n- In this case, the first method worked well, so I'll stick with it.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>x = 3</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- By finding the inverse function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) and substituting it into \\( g(x) \\), I was able to set up an equation and solve for \\( x \\).\n- The solution \\( x = 3 \\) satisfies the condition \\( g(x) = 15 \\), as verified by substituting back into the original functions.\n- Throughout the process, I checked each step to ensure accuracy and explored alternative strategies to confirm the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\nThere we go! The problem is solved step by step, maintaining the original thought process while ensuring clarity and coherence.",
  "ground_truth": "Since $g(x)=3f^{-1}(x)$, we have that $3f^{-1}(x)=15$. This means that $f^{-1}(x)=\\frac{15}{3}=5$. Since $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are inverse functions, if $f^{-1}(x)=5$, we also have that $f(5)=x$. Substituting this back into our equation $f(x)=\\frac{24}{x+3}$, we get that $$x=f(5)=\\frac{24}{5+3}=\\boxed{3}.$$"
