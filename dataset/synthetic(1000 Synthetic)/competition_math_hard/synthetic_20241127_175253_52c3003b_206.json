  "solution": "Certainly! Let's organize the solution into a clear, structured format while maintaining the original insights and reflections. Here's how I'd approach it:\n\n---\n\n## **Solving the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x+4}{x^2+4x-5}=\\frac{2-x}{x-1}\n\\]\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this equation. At first glance, it's a rational equation with fractions on both sides. My initial goal is to find the value(s) of \\(x\\) that satisfy the equation. I'm considering different strategies like **cross-multiplying** to eliminate fractions or **factoring** the denominators to simplify. Let's brainstorm these options to determine the best approach.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Cross-Multiply:** This could help eliminate the fractions and simplify the equation.\n   \n2. **Factor the Denominators:** If the denominators can be factored, terms might cancel, making the equation easier to handle.\n\n3. **Simplify Each Side Individually:** Simplifying each fraction before equating them could reveal a pattern.\n\n4. **Substitution:** Although less likely needed here, substituting \\(x\\) with a dummy variable might help in some cases.\n\n**Decision:** I'm leaning towards **cross-multiplying** as the most straightforward method, but I'll keep factoring in mind if cross-multiplying doesn't work out.\n\n### **Starting with Cross-Multiplication**\n\n#### **Step 1: Cross-Multiply to Eliminate Fractions**\n\nLet's cross-multiply to get rid of the denominators:\n\n\\[\n(2x + 4)(x - 1) = (2 - x)(x^2 + 4x - 5)\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** This should transform the equation into a polynomial, making it easier to solve for \\(x\\). I'll proceed by expanding both sides carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating and Expanding Both Sides**\n\n#### **Step 2: Expand Both Sides**\n\n**Left Side:**\n\n\\[\n(2x + 4)(x - 1) = 2x(x) + 2x(-1) + 4(x) + 4(-1) = 2x^2 - 2x + 4x - 4 = 2x^2 + 2x - 4\n\\]\n\n**Right Side:**\n\n\\[\n(2 - x)(x^2 + 4x - 5) = 2(x^2) + 2(4x) + 2(-5) - x(x^2) - x(4x) - x(-5) = 2x^2 + 8x - 10 - x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x = -x^3 - 2x^2 + 13x - 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** I double-checked the expansions to ensure accuracy. It's crucial to verify each step to prevent errors from compounding.\n\n#### **Step 3: Set the Expanded Equations Equal**\n\nNow, I'll set both expanded sides equal:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 + 2x - 4 = -x^3 - 2x^2 + 13x - 10\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** This forms a polynomial equation. To solve it, I'll bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Rearranging the Equation**\n\n#### **Step 4: Bring All Terms to One Side**\n\nI'll move all terms to the left side:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 + 2x - 4 + x^3 + 2x^2 - 13x + 10 = 0\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 4x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Now, I have a cubic equation. Solving cubic equations can be tricky, so I'll attempt factoring by looking for rational roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Attempting to Factor the Cubic Equation**\n\n#### **Step 5: Look for Rational Roots Using the Rational Root Theorem**\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem suggests that possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (\\(6\\)) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (\\(1\\)). Possible roots are:\n\n\\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm6\\)\n\n**Thoughts:** I'll test these potential roots to see if any satisfy the equation.\n\n#### **Step 6: Test Potential Roots**\n\nLet's start with \\(x = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n1^3 + 4(1)^2 - 11(1) + 6 = 1 + 4 - 11 + 6 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Perfect! \\(x = 1\\) is a root.\n\n**Reflection:** Since \\(x = 1\\) is a root, I can factor \\((x - 1)\\) out of the cubic equation. I'll proceed with polynomial division to simplify the equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Factoring the Cubic Equation**\n\n#### **Step 7: Perform Polynomial Division**\n\nI'll divide \\(x^3 + 4x^2 - 11x + 6\\) by \\((x - 1)\\) using synthetic or long division.\n\n**Step-by-Step Division:**\n\n1. **Divide:** \\(x^3\\) divided by \\(x\\) gives \\(x^2\\).\n2. **Multiply:** \\(x^2 \\times (x - 1) = x^3 - x^2\\).\n3. **Subtract:** \n   \\[\n   (x^3 + 4x^2) - (x^3 - x^2) = 5x^2\n   \\]\n4. **Bring Down:** Bring down \\(-11x\\) to get \\(5x^2 - 11x\\).\n5. **Repeat:** \n   - \\(5x^2\\) divided by \\(x\\) gives \\(5x\\).\n   - \\(5x \\times (x - 1) = 5x^2 - 5x\\).\n   - Subtract: \n     \\[\n     (5x^2 - 11x) - (5x^2 - 5x) = -6x\n     \\]\n6. **Bring Down:** Bring down \\(+6\\) to get \\(-6x + 6\\).\n7. **Final Step:** \n   - \\(-6x\\) divided by \\(x\\) gives \\(-6\\).\n   - \\(-6 \\times (x - 1) = -6x + 6\\).\n   - Subtract: \n     \\[\n     (-6x + 6) - (-6x + 6) = 0\n     \\]\n   \n**Result:** The quotient is \\(x^2 + 5x - 6\\), and the remainder is \\(0\\), confirming that \\((x - 1)\\) is a factor.\n\n**Reflection:** Now, the original cubic equation factors as:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)(x^2 + 5x - 6) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Wait a minute:** Before proceeding, let me double-check the polynomial division to ensure no mistakes were made. Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the Factored Equation**\n\n#### **Step 8: Solve for Other Roots**\n\nI'll solve the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + 5x - 6 = 0\\) using factoring.\n\n#### **Step 9: Attempt to Factor the Quadratic**\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-6\\) and add to \\(5\\):\n\n\\[\n(x + 6)(x - 1) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Wait:** Hold on, \\(x - 1\\) is already a factor from the cubic. So, the correct factorization is:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)(x + 6) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This means the additional root is \\(x = -6\\).\n\n**Check:** Let me verify by expanding:\n\n\\[\n(x + 6)(x - 1) = x^2 + 5x - 6\n\\]\n\nYup, it matches the original quadratic.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Step: Listing All Solutions**\n\n#### **Step 10: Write Down All Roots**\n\nFrom the factored equation:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)(x + 6) = 0\n\\]\n\nThe solutions are:\n\n\\[\nx = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -6\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Before finalizing, I must check these solutions in the original equation to ensure they don't make any denominators zero (which would invalidate them).\n\n#### **Step 11: Verify Solutions**\n\n**Original Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x+4}{x^2+4x-5}=\\frac{2-x}{x-1}\n\\]\n\n**Denominators:**\n\n- \\(x^2 + 4x - 5\\): Let's factor this to find where it's zero.\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 4x - 5 = (x - 1)(x + 5) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -5\\) make the denominator zero.\n\n- \\(x - 1\\): Zero at \\(x = 1\\).\n\n**Checking Solutions:**\n\n- \\(x = 1\\): This makes both denominators zero, **so it's an extraneous solution** and must be discarded.\n\n- \\(x = -6\\): This does **not** make any denominator zero, so it's a valid solution.\n\n**Reflection:** Initially, I found \\(x = 1\\) as a root, but upon verifying, it turns out to be invalid because it makes the denominators zero. Only \\(x = -6\\) remains as a valid solution.\n\n**Wait:** Does that mean cross-multiplying introduced an extraneous solution? Yes, sometimes cross-multiplying can do that, which is why checking the solutions in the original equation is crucial.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER> solution\n\nAfter thoroughly exploring different strategies, cross-multiplying, factoring, and verifying potential roots, the valid solution to the equation is:\n\n\\[\nx = -6\n\\]\n\n{ \"answer\": -6 }\n\n---\n\nBy organizing the solution this way, each step is clearly defined, and reflections are used to ensure accuracy and correctness throughout the process.",
  "ground_truth": "We notice that the denominator on the left factors, giving us \\[\\frac{2x+4}{(x-1)(x+5)}=\\frac{2-x}{x-1}.\\]As long as $x\\neq1$ we are allowed to cancel $x-1$ from the denominators, giving \\[\\frac{2x+4}{x+5}=2-x.\\]Now we can cross-multiply to find \\[2x+4=(2-x)(x+5)=-x^2-3x+10.\\]We simplify this to  \\[x^2+5x-6=0\\]and then factor to  \\[(x-1)(x+6)=0.\\]Notice that since $x-1$ is in the denominator of the original equation, $x=1$ is an extraneous solution.  However $x=\\boxed{-6}$ does solve the original equation."
