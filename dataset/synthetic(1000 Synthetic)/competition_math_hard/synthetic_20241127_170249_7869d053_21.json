  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem the way a human would\u2014brainstorming different strategies, reflecting at each step, checking for correctness, and being open to changing directions if needed. I'll write out my thought process just as I would naturally think through it.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first read the question, it says:\n\n_When the decimal point of a certain positive decimal number is moved four places to the right, the new number is four times the reciprocal of the original number. What is the original number?_\n\n---\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \n- **This sounds like a relationship between a number and its reciprocal.**  \n- **Moving the decimal point significantly changes the number's magnitude.**  \n- **I've seen problems involving reciprocals before, but combining it with shifting decimals is interesting.**\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **Maybe I can represent the original number with a variable.**  \n- **I could set up an equation based on the given conditions.**  \n- **Alternatively, I could try using a specific example to see how it works.**\n\n**Wait, But...**  \n- **Using a specific example might not generalize well.**  \n- **An equation seems more reliable for finding the exact number.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Representing the Original Number**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Let's assign a variable to the original number. That way, I can create an equation to work with.**\n\n**Action:**  \n- Let\u2019s say the original number is \\( x \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **This makes sense because I need a placeholder to manipulate mathematically.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Moving the Decimal Point Four Places to the Right**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Moving the decimal point to the right multiplies the number by 10 for each place.**  \n- **So, moving it four places means multiplying by \\( 10^4 \\) or 10,000.**\n\n**Action:**  \n- The new number becomes \\( 10,000 \\times x \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- **If \\( x \\) was 0.1, moving the decimal four places would make it 1,000. That checks out.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Understanding the Reciprocal Relationship**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **The question states that this new number is four times the reciprocal of the original number.**  \n- **Reciprocal means \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\).**  \n- **So, four times the reciprocal would be \\( 4 \\times \\frac{1}{x} \\).**\n\n**Action:**  \n- Set up the equation:  \n  \\[\n  10,000 \\times x = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{x}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **This equation looks correct because it directly translates the problem statement into mathematical terms.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **I need to solve for \\( x \\).**  \n- **This looks like a straightforward algebraic equation, but involving reciprocals.**  \n- **Multiplying both sides by \\( x \\) might eliminate the fraction.**\n\n**Action:**  \n- Multiply both sides by \\( x \\) to get rid of the denominator:  \n  \\[\n  10,000x^2 = 4\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- **By multiplying both sides by \\( x \\), the reciprocal term was eliminated, simplifying the equation. That\u2019s a good move.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Isolating \\( x^2 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Now, I have a quadratic equation in terms of \\( x^2 \\).**  \n- **Divide both sides by 10,000 to solve for \\( x^2 \\).**\n\n**Action:**  \n- Divide both sides by 10,000:  \n  \\[\n  x^2 = \\frac{4}{10,000} = 0.0004\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- **Dividing 4 by 10,000 gives 0.0004. That seems correct.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Solving for \\( x \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **I need to take the square root of both sides to solve for \\( x \\).**  \n- **Since the original number is positive, I'll consider only the positive square root.**\n\n**Action:**  \n- Taking the square root:  \n  \\[\n  x = \\sqrt{0.0004} = 0.02\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **0.02 seems like a reasonable answer.**  \n- **But let me double-check by plugging it back into the original condition.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Always good to verify if the solution satisfies the original problem.**  \n- **If \\( x = 0.02 \\), moving the decimal four places to the right gives 200.**  \n- **The reciprocal of 0.02 is 50, and four times that is 200.**\n\n**Action:**  \n- Calculate:  \n  - Move decimal: \\( 0.02 \\rightarrow 200 \\)  \n  - Reciprocal of 0.02: \\( \\frac{1}{0.02} = 50 \\)  \n  - Four times reciprocal: \\( 4 \\times 50 = 200 \\)  \n\n**Verification:**  \n- **The new number (200) matches four times the reciprocal (200).**  \n- **This confirms that \\( x = 0.02 \\) is indeed the correct solution.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThe original number is \\( 0.02 \\).  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Brainstormed Different Strategies:**  \n  Initially considered using a variable or trying specific examples. Decided that setting up an equation was more reliable.\n\n- **Reflected and Checked at Each Step:**  \n  Consistently checked whether each step made sense and aligned with the original problem statement.\n\n- **Verified the Solution:**  \n  Plugged the solution back into the original condition to ensure correctness.\n\n- **Adaptability:**  \n  Remained open to adjusting the approach if any step didn't work out, but in this case, the initial strategy was effective.\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step, continuously reflecting, and verifying the solution, we ensured that the final answer was accurate and aligned with the given conditions.",
  "ground_truth": "If $x$ is the number, then moving the decimal point four places to the right is the same as multiplying $x$ by $10{,}000$. That is, $10{,}000x = 4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$, which is equivalent to $x^2 = 4/10{,}000$. Since $x$ is positive, it follows that $x = 2/100 = \\boxed{0.02}$."
