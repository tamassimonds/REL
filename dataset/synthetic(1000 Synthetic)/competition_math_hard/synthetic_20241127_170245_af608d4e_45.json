  "solution": "Alright, let's put everything together into a smooth, coherent solution. We\u2019ll keep the final answer the same but ensure the narrative flows naturally, just like a well-thought-out problem-solving process.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem Statement**\n\nAn investment of \\$10,000 is made at a simple annual interest rate of 12% for six months. After this period, the total amount is reinvested for another six months at an unknown annual interest rate \\( r\\% \\). At the end of the second six-month period, the investment totals \\$11,130.  \n  \n**Question:** What is the annual interest rate \\( r \\) of the second certificate?\n\n---\n\n### **Solution: Step-by-Step Approach**\n\n**First Thoughts**\n\nWhen faced with this problem, I need to determine the unknown interest rate \\( r \\) applied during the second six-month period. To tackle this, I'll brainstorm different strategies, explore simple interest concepts, and ensure each step checks out before moving forward.\n\n#### **Step 1: Calculate the Amount After the First Six Months**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Simple Interest Application:** Since the first investment period is six months at a 12% annual simple interest rate, I should calculate the interest earned over this time.\n\n**Formula Used:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Interest} = \\text{Principal} \\times \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]  \nWhere:  \n- Principal = \\$10,000  \n- Rate = 12% per annum = 0.12  \n- Time = 6 months = 0.5 years  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Interest} = 10{,}000 \\times 0.12 \\times 0.5 = 600\n\\]  \nThus, the total amount after the first six months is:  \n\\[\n10{,}000 + 600 = 10{,}600\n\\]  \n\n**Check:**  \n- **Does it Make Sense?**  \n  - 12% annually on \\$10,000 is \\$1,200.  \n  - Half a year (6 months) should earn \\$600.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  - The calculation is correct.\n\n#### **Step 2: Reinvest the Total Amount for Another Six Months**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Second Investment Period:** Now, the total \\$10,600 is reinvested at an unknown annual interest rate \\( r\\% \\) for another six months.  \n- **Goal:** Use the final amount of \\$11,130 to solve for \\( r \\).\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**  \nUsing the simple interest formula again:  \n\\[\n11{,}130 = 10{,}600 + (10{,}600 \\times r \\times 0.5)\n\\]  \n**Breaking It Down:**  \n\\[\n11{,}130 = 10{,}600 + 5{,}300r\n\\]  \n\\[\n11{,}130 - 10{,}600 = 5{,}300r\n\\]  \n\\[\n530 = 5{,}300r\n\\]  \n\\[\nr = \\frac{530}{5{,}300} = 0.1 = 10\\%\n\\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Is 10% Realistic?**  \n  - A 10% annual rate yields \\$530 over six months on \\$10,600.  \n  - This matches the increase to \\$11,130.  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  - The value makes sense and aligns with the given data.\n\n#### **Step 3: Verification**\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- **Annual Interest Calculation:**  \n  - 10% of \\$10,600 = \\$1,060 per year.  \n  - For six months, it's \\$530.  \n- **Final Amount:**  \n  - Adding \\$530 to \\$10,600 yields \\$11,130, confirming the correctness.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \n- **Strategy Validity:**  \n  - Calculating each period separately proved effective.  \n- **Accuracy:**  \n  - Multiple checks confirm that \\( r = 10\\% \\) is correct.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter methodically analyzing each step and verifying the calculations, we determined that the annual interest rate of the second certificate is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10\\%}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Approach**\n\n1. **First Six Months:**  \n   - Calculated simple interest on \\$10,000 at 12% per annum for six months, resulting in a total of \\$10,600.\n\n2. **Second Six Months:**  \n   - Reinvested \\$10,600 at an unknown rate \\( r\\% \\).  \n   - Set up an equation using the final amount of \\$11,130 to solve for \\( r \\).  \n   - Found \\( r \\) to be 10%.\n\n3. **Verification:**  \n   - Performed quick checks to ensure the calculations aligned with the given data.  \n\nBy following a structured approach, brainstorming strategies, and verifying each step, we confidently arrived at the correct interest rate for the second investment period.\n\n---\n\nWith this organized solution, the problem is comprehensively addressed, ensuring clarity and correctness throughout the process.",
  "ground_truth": "For the first six months, the (simple) interest rate is $12/2 = 6$ percent.  Therefore, the investment grows to $10000 \\cdot 1.06 = 10600$.\n\nLet the annual interest rate of the second certificate be $r$ percent.  Then the interest rate for six months is $r/2$, so the investment grows to $10600 \\cdot \\left( 1 + \\frac{r/2}{100} \\right)$.  Therefore, \\[10600 \\cdot \\left( 1 + \\frac{r/2}{100} \\right) = 11130.\\] Then \\[1 + \\frac{r/2}{100} = \\frac{11130}{10600} = 1.05,\\] so $r/200 = 0.05$, which means $r = \\boxed{10}$."
