  "problem": "What is the sum of all values of $x$ for which $\\sqrt{(x+3)^{2}} = 7$?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's put this all together into a cohesive solution, maintaining the original thought process and final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the sum of all \\( x \\) values that satisfy the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x+3)^{2}} = 7\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis equation involves a square root, which often hints at absolute values. To tackle it, we'll brainstorm a few strategies to ensure we capture all possible solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Absolute Value Interpretation:**  \n   Recognize that \\( \\sqrt{a^2} = |a| \\). Therefore, rewrite the equation using absolute values.\n\n2. **Squaring Both Sides:**  \n   Another approach is to square both sides to eliminate the square root, but this might introduce extraneous solutions.\n\n3. **Graphical Visualization:**  \n   Consider the geometric meaning\u2014visualizing the distance from a point.\n\nWe'll start with the **Absolute Value Interpretation** since it's the most straightforward and least likely to introduce extraneous solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Absolute Value**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x+3)^{2}} = 7\n\\]\n\nWe know that:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^2} = |a|\n\\]\n\nSo, rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n|x+3| = 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis transformation makes sense because the square root of a square always yields the absolute value. Now, we have an absolute value equation to solve.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Absolute Value Equation**\n\nThe equation \\( |x+3| = 7 \\) translates to two linear equations:\n\n1. \\( x + 3 = 7 \\)\n2. \\( x + 3 = -7 \\)\n\nLet's solve each one:\n\n**First Equation:**  \n\\[\nx + 3 = 7  \n\\]\n\\[\nx = 7 - 3 = 4  \n\\]\n\n**Second Equation:**  \n\\[\nx + 3 = -7  \n\\]\n\\[\nx = -7 - 3 = -10  \n\\]\n\n**Intermediate Check:**  \nWe have two potential solutions: \\( x = 4 \\) and \\( x = -10 \\). Next, we'll verify these solutions to ensure they satisfy the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verification of Solutions**\n\n**Why Verify?**  \nVerification is crucial to confirm that our solutions are correct and that no extraneous solutions were introduced.\n\n**Checking \\( x = 4 \\):**  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{(4 + 3)^{2}} = \\sqrt{7^{2}} = \\sqrt{49} = 7  \n\\]\nThis matches the right-hand side (\\(7\\)), so \\( x = 4 \\) is a valid solution.\n\n**Checking \\( x = -10 \\):**  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{(-10 + 3)^{2}} = \\sqrt{(-7)^{2}} = \\sqrt{49} = 7  \n\\]\nThis also matches the right-hand side (\\(7\\)), so \\( x = -10 \\) is a valid solution.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth solutions satisfy the original equation, confirming their validity.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Graphical Interpretation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo reinforce our algebraic solution, let's consider the graphical meaning. The expression \\( \\sqrt{(x+3)^{2}} \\) represents the distance from \\( x \\) to \\(-3\\). Therefore, we're looking for points where this distance equals \\( 7 \\).\n\n**Graphical Insight:**  \nThere are two such points:\n\n- \\( x \\) is \\( 7 \\) units to the right of \\(-3\\):  \n  \\(-3 + 7 = 4\\)\n  \n- \\( x \\) is \\( 7 \\) units to the left of \\(-3\\):  \n  \\(-3 - 7 = -10\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis confirms our earlier solutions, providing a visual validation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Sum of Solutions**\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of all \\( x \\) values that satisfy the equation. We have:\n\n\\[\nx = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -10\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n4 + (-10) = 4 - 10 = -6\n\\]\n\n**Intermediate Check:**  \nAdding \\( 4 \\) and \\(-10\\) indeed yields \\(-6\\), which aligns with our expectations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Answer**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll strategies\u2014both algebraic and graphical\u2014lead to the same solutions. Verification confirms their correctness, and the sum calculation is straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe sum of all values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the equation \\( \\sqrt{(x+3)^{2}} = 7 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-6}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Check:**  \nBy methodically exploring different strategies, verifying solutions, and cross-checking with graphical interpretations, we've ensured the correctness of the final answer: \\(-6\\).",
  "ground_truth": "49 is the number whose square root is 7, so we must have \\[(x+3)^2 = 49.\\] Therefore, we must have $x+3 = 7$ or $x+3 = -7$.  The first equation gives us $x = 4$ the second gives us $x = -10$.  Both are solutions, so the sum of all possible values of $x$ is $4 + (-10) = \\boxed{-6}$."
