  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem as if I'm tackling it step by step, brainstorming different strategies, checking each step, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we have a right cylinder inscribed in a sphere. The sphere has a radius of 5 units, and the cylinder's base radius is 3 units. We need to find the volume inside the sphere but outside the cylinder, expressed as \\( W\\pi \\), and then determine \\( W \\) as a common fraction.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This reminds me of problems involving volumes of inscribed shapes.\n- I think I'll need to calculate the volumes of both the sphere and the cylinder.\n- Subtracting the cylinder's volume from the sphere's should give me the desired volume.\n\nBut wait... is it really that straightforward? Let's brainstorm some strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate Volumes Directly:**\n   - Find the volume of the sphere.\n   - Find the volume of the cylinder.\n   - Subtract the cylinder's volume from the sphere's volume.\n\n2. **Use Geometry Relationships:**\n   - Since the cylinder is inscribed, there might be a relationship between the sphere's radius and the cylinder's dimensions.\n   - Possibly use the Pythagorean theorem to find the cylinder's height.\n\n3. **Visualize the Problem:**\n   - Sketching might help to see the relationship between the sphere and the cylinder.\n   - Understanding how the cylinder fits inside the sphere could lead to better insights.\n\n4. **Check for Symmetry:**\n   - The problem might have symmetry that can simplify calculations.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Calculating volumes directly seems like a good starting point, but I might need the cylinder's height, which isn't given.\n- Using geometric relationships could help find the missing dimensions.\n\n**Decision:**\n- I'll start by exploring the geometric relationships to find the cylinder's height. If that works, I can proceed with calculating the volumes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Geometric Relationships**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since the cylinder is inscribed in the sphere, the cylinder's height and diameter should relate to the sphere's diameter.\n- I recall that for an inscribed cylinder, the diagonal of the cylinder equals the sphere's diameter.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- The sphere's diameter is \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) units.\n- The cylinder's base radius is 3 units, so the diameter is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) units.\n- Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the cylinder's height (\\( h \\)), radius, and diagonal:\n  \\[\n  h^2 + 6^2 = 10^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  h^2 + 36 = 100\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  h^2 = 64 \\Rightarrow h = 8 \\text{ units}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this make sense? The cylinder's height being 8 units fits within the sphere's diameter of 10 units.\n- **Conclusion:** This step seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Volume of the Sphere**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The volume of a sphere is given by \\( V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\).\n- I can plug in the sphere's radius to find its volume.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (5)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 125 = \\frac{500}{3} \\pi \\text{ cubic units}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Quick mental math: \\( 5^3 = 125 \\), and multiplying by \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\) gives \\( \\frac{500}{3} \\).\n- **Conclusion:** This calculation is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Volume of the Cylinder**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The volume of a cylinder is given by \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\).\n- I have the radius (3 units) and the height (8 units) from earlier.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 8 = 72\\pi \\text{ cubic units}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- \\( 3^2 = 9 \\), and \\( 9 \\times 8 = 72 \\).\n- **Conclusion:** The volume calculation is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Volume Outside the Cylinder but Inside the Sphere**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, subtract the cylinder's volume from the sphere's volume to find the desired volume.\n- \\( W\\pi = V_{\\text{sphere}} - V_{\\text{cylinder}} \\)\n  \n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nW\\pi = \\frac{500}{3}\\pi - 72\\pi\n\\]\n\\[\nW\\pi = \\left( \\frac{500}{3} - \\frac{216}{3} \\right) \\pi = \\frac{284}{3}\\pi\n\\]\n\\[\nW = \\frac{284}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Converted 72 into \\( \\frac{216}{3} \\) to have a common denominator.\n- \\( 500 - 216 = 284 \\), so \\( \\frac{284}{3} \\) is correct.\n- **Conclusion:** This step is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before finalizing the answer, let's double-check everything:\n  - Is the cylinder's height correct?\n  - Are the volume formulas applied correctly?\n  - Does the subtraction make sense?\n\n**Reflection:**\n- All calculations seem consistent.\n- The approach aligns with the problem requirements.\n- No inconsistencies detected.\n\n**Decision:**\n- The solution appears correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(<ANSWER> W = \\frac{284}{3} </ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Validating the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Did I consider all necessary components?\n- Was there a simpler method I overlooked?\n- Does the answer make logical sense?\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The strategy of subtracting volumes is straightforward and appropriate for this problem.\n- No alternative methods come to mind that would simplify the process further.\n- The numerical answer seems reasonable given the dimensions involved.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The approach and calculations are correct.\n- The final answer is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(<ANSWER>W = \\frac{284}{3}</ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\nBy walking through each step, reflecting, and checking along the way, I've ensured that the solution is both accurate and complete.",
  "ground_truth": "To begin, we need to visualize the cylinder inscribed in the sphere.  We can draw the cylinder as shown: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(6,0)--(6,8)--(0,8)--cycle,linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,8)--(6,0),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,0)..(3,-1.5)..(6,0),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,0)..(3,1.5)..(6,0),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,8)..(3,9.5)..(6,8),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,8)..(3,6.5)..(6,8),linewidth(.7));\nlabel(\"6\",(3,8),N);\nlabel(\"10\",(3,4),NE);\n[/asy] A diagonal drawn in the cylinder will have length 10, which is the diameter of the sphere.  We can see that a 6-8-10 right triangle is formed by the height of the cylinder, the diameter of the sphere, and the diameter of the base of the cylinder.  Now that we know the height of the cylinder, we have everything we need to compute the desired volume: $$V_{sphere}=\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\cdot \\pi\\cdot 5^3=\\frac{500\\pi}{3}$$$$V_{cylinder}=\\pi r^2\\cdot h=\\pi \\cdot 3^2\\cdot 8=72\\pi .$$The volume inside the sphere and outside the cylinder is the difference of the above values: $$V_{sphere}-V_{cylinder}=\\frac{500\\pi}{3}-72\\pi =\\frac{500\\pi-216\\pi}{3}=\\boxed{\\frac{284}{3}}\\pi .$$"
