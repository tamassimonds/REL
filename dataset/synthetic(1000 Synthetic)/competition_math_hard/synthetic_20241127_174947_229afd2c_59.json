  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through it just like I would if I were solving it on paper, complete with brainstorming, checking my work, reflecting, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first encounter this series:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{3^2 \\cdot 7^2} + \\frac{9}{7^2 \\cdot 11^2} + \\frac{13}{11^2 \\cdot 15^2} + \\dotsb\n\\]\n\nI notice it's an infinite series with fractions involving squared denominators. This reminds me of problems that might involve telescoping series or partial fractions. But honestly, at first glance, I'm not entirely sure which method will work best.\n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n- **Telescoping Series:** Maybe the series collapses nicely if terms cancel out.\n- **Partial Fractions:** Decomposing each term might reveal a pattern.\n- **Identifying a Pattern:** Looking for a general term to see if the series converges.\n\nI'm leaning towards exploring the telescoping series idea since I've seen similar structures before where terms cancel out, making the series easier to sum. Let's see if that works.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **1. Strategy 1: Telescoping Series**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf this is a telescoping series, successive terms should cancel each other out, leaving only a few terms contributing to the final sum.\n\n**Checking the Structure:**\nLet\u2019s write out the first few terms to see if any cancellation occurs:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{3^2 \\cdot 7^2} + \\frac{9}{7^2 \\cdot 11^2} + \\frac{13}{11^2 \\cdot 15^2} + \\dotsb\n\\]\n\nHmm, looking at this, I don't immediately see how terms would cancel. The numerators and denominators don't seem to align in a way that facilitates cancellation.\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait a minute\u2014typically in telescoping series, the denominators of one term match the numerators of another, or there's a clear pattern of cancellation. Here, the denominators are consecutive squares, but the numerators don't seem to align for cancellation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis **doesn't look like a telescoping series**. So, I need to try a different approach.\n\n#### **2. Strategy 2: Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nMaybe I can decompose each fraction into simpler parts that reveal a pattern or allow for easier summation.\n\n**Attempting Partial Fractions:**\nLet\u2019s take the first term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{3^2 \\cdot 7^2}\n\\]\n\nSuppose I can express this as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A}{3^2} + \\frac{B}{7^2}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, the numerators are single constants, and the denominators are squared products. Normally, partial fraction decomposition works well when the denominators are linear factors. Here, since both are squared, it complicates things.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis approach might require more complex decomposition, and I'm not sure if it will lead to a neat pattern. Also, given that the numerators are increasing, it doesn't immediately suggest that partial fractions will simplify the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPartial fraction decomposition **may not be the most straightforward approach** here. Time to think of another strategy.\n\n#### **3. Strategy 3: Identifying a Pattern or General Term**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nPerhaps I can find a general expression for the \\( n \\)-th term and see if the series resembles a known convergent series.\n\n**Examining the Terms:**\nLet\u2019s identify the pattern:\n\n- Numerators: \\( 5, 9, 13, \\dotsb \\)\n- Denominators: \\( 3^2 \\cdot 7^2, 7^2 \\cdot 11^2, 11^2 \\cdot 15^2, \\dotsb \\)\n\n**Numerator Pattern:**\nThe numerators increase by 4 each time: \\( 5 + 4 = 9 \\), \\( 9 + 4 = 13 \\), etc.\n\nSo, the numerator for the \\( n \\)-th term is:  \n\\[ \n5 + 4(n - 1) = 4n + 1 \n\\]\n\n**Denominator Pattern:**\nThe denominators are products of consecutive odd squares:  \n\\[ \n(3, 7), (7, 11), (11, 15), \\dotsb \n\\]\n\n**General Term:**\nFor the \\( n \\)-th term:  \n\\[\na_n = \\frac{4n + 1}{[(4n - 1)^2] \\cdot [(4n + 3)^2]} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis gives me a neat general term, but I'm still not sure how to sum the series directly. It doesn't immediately resemble a standard convergent series like geometric or harmonic.\n\n**Next Step:**\nMaybe I can manipulate this general term to resemble a known series or apply a convergence test to see if the series converges and find its sum.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying Convergence Tests**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore trying to sum the series, it might be useful to determine if it converges. Common tests include the **Ratio Test**, **Comparison Test**, and **Integral Test**.\n\n#### **1. Using the Ratio Test**\n\n**Setup:**\nCompute the limit:  \n\\[\nL = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \\right|\n\\]\n\nIf \\( L < 1 \\), the series converges absolutely.\n\n**Calculating \\( a_{n+1} \\):**\n\\[\na_{n+1} = \\frac{4(n+1) + 1}{[(4(n+1) - 1)^2] \\cdot [(4(n+1) + 3)^2]} = \\frac{4n + 5}{[(4n + 3)^2] \\cdot [(4n + 7)^2]}\n\\]\n\n**Ratio:**\n\\[\n\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \\frac{(4n + 5)}{(4n + 3)^2 \\cdot (4n + 7)^2} \\times \\frac{(4n - 1)^2 \\cdot (4n + 3)^2}{4n + 1}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this ratio looks messy, and I'm not sure if it will lead to an easy limit.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems **complicated**, and I might end up spending too much time without a clear path forward. Perhaps the Ratio Test isn't the best choice here.\n\n#### **2. Using the Comparison Test**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI can compare the given series to a known convergent or divergent series.\n\n**Comparison Series:**\nSince the denominators involve even powers, the terms decrease rapidly. Let's compare it to a **p-series**, where:  \n\\[\n\\sum \\frac{1}{n^p} \\ \\text{converges if} \\ p > 1\n\\]\n\nOur terms:  \n\\[\na_n = \\frac{4n + 1}{(4n - 1)^2 \\cdot (4n + 3)^2}\n\\]\n\nFor large \\( n \\), the denominator behaves like \\( n^4 \\), so:  \n\\[\na_n \\approx \\frac{1}{n^4}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( p = 4 > 1 \\), the series **converges**.\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, so the series converges. But knowing convergence isn't enough\u2014I still need to find the sum. This test helps, but it doesn't bring me closer to the exact value.\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting the Telescoping Series Idea**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nPerhaps I dismissed the telescoping series approach too quickly. Maybe I need to look at the terms differently to see if cancellation occurs.\n\n**Attempting to Rewrite Terms:**\nLet's try expressing each term in a way that might reveal cancellation.\n\nConsider the first term:  \n\\[\n\\frac{5}{3^2 \\cdot 7^2}\n\\]\n\nI notice that the **denominators are consecutive squared odd numbers**. Maybe there's a way to write each term as a difference of fractions.\n\n**Idea:**\nSuppose I can express each term as:  \n\\[\n\\frac{5}{3^2 \\cdot 7^2} = \\frac{A}{3^2} - \\frac{A}{7^2}\n\\]\n\nThis kind of expression often leads to telescoping. Let's see if it works.\n\n**Solving for \\( A \\):**\nSet up the equation:  \n\\[\n\\frac{A}{3^2} - \\frac{A}{7^2} = \\frac{5}{3^2 \\cdot 7^2}\n\\]\n\nCombine the fractions on the left:  \n\\[\nA \\left( \\frac{1}{9} - \\frac{1}{49} \\right) = \\frac{5}{441}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the difference:  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{9} - \\frac{1}{49} = \\frac{49 - 9}{441} = \\frac{40}{441}\n\\]\n\nSo:  \n\\[\nA \\times \\frac{40}{441} = \\frac{5}{441}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( A \\):  \n\\[\nA = \\frac{5}{441} \\times \\frac{441}{40} = \\frac{5}{40} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Expression:**\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{3^2 \\cdot 7^2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\left( \\frac{1}{3^2} - \\frac{1}{7^2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Generalizing for All Terms:**\nLet's see if this works for the other terms.\n\nSecond term:  \n\\[\n\\frac{9}{7^2 \\cdot 11^2}\n\\]\n\nAttempting to write it as:  \n\\[\n\\frac{B}{7^2} - \\frac{B}{11^2}\n\\]\n\nFollowing the same process:  \n\\[\nB \\left( \\frac{1}{49} - \\frac{1}{121} \\right) = \\frac{9}{5929}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the difference:  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{49} - \\frac{1}{121} = \\frac{121 - 49}{5929} = \\frac{72}{5929}\n\\]\n\nSo:  \n\\[\nB \\times \\frac{72}{5929} = \\frac{9}{5929}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( B \\):  \n\\[\nB = \\frac{9}{5929} \\times \\frac{5929}{72} = \\frac{9}{72} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Interesting!**\nIt seems that **\\( A = B = \\frac{1}{8} \\)**. Maybe this pattern continues for all terms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEach term can be expressed as:  \n\\[\na_n = \\frac{1}{8} \\left( \\frac{1}{(4n - 1)^2} - \\frac{1}{(4n + 3)^2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, the series becomes:  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8} \\left( \\frac{1}{3^2} - \\frac{1}{7^2} \\right) + \\frac{1}{8} \\left( \\frac{1}{7^2} - \\frac{1}{11^2} \\right) + \\frac{1}{8} \\left( \\frac{1}{11^2} - \\frac{1}{15^2} \\right) + \\dotsb\n\\]\n\n**Telescoping Effect:**\nNow, I see that **successive terms cancel each other out**. The series telescopes!\n\n**Reflection:**\nGreat! This means that most terms cancel, leaving only the first term\u2019s initial part and the last term\u2019s final part. Since it's an infinite series, the last term's denominator goes to infinity, making its contribution zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Sum**\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{3^2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{1}{72}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Answer**\n\nLet me quickly verify this by considering the nature of the series and the telescoping effect.\n\n- **Each Pair Cancels:** Only the very first \\(\\frac{1}{3^2}\\) remains, as all intermediate terms cancel out.\n- **Convergence:** Since the series converges, and we've accounted for all non-zero contributions, the sum should be accurate.\n\n**Confidence in the Solution:**\nGiven that the telescoping series approach works and all intermediate terms cancel, leaving only the first term's contribution, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n\\(<ANSWER> \\frac{1}{72} </ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Initial Thoughts:** At first, I wasn't sure which method to use. Exploring telescoping and partial fractions helped me zero in on the right approach.\n\n- **Checking Work:** Throughout the process, I continuously checked whether terms canceled and whether the series made sense.\n\n- **Adjusting Strategies:** When partial fractions didn't immediately help, I revisited the telescoping idea, which led to the solution.\n\n- **Human-Like Thinking:** This problem required me to brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their effectiveness, and adapt my approach based on what worked. By allowing myself to explore and make adjustments, I was able to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(<ANSWER> \\frac{1}{72} </ANSWER>\\)\n\nThe sum of the series is \\(\\frac{1}{72}\\).\n\n---\n\n**Summary**\n\nThrough brainstorming different strategies\u2014starting with telescoping series and partial fractions and then identifying a general term\u2014I determined that expressing each term as a difference of fractions led to a telescoping series. This approach revealed that most terms canceled, leaving only the first term's contribution. By continually reflecting and adjusting my approach, I confidently arrived at the correct sum of \\(\\frac{1}{72}\\).\n\n**End of Solution**",
