  "solution": "Absolutely, let's craft a concise and coherent solution based on the given working out. We'll ensure that the thought process remains intact while making it flow naturally. Here's how we can put it together:\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Question\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( x \\) for which the inverse function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is undefined, given that \\( f(x) = \\frac{x-3}{x-4} \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \n- This involves inverse functions and their domains.\n- I need to identify where the inverse function doesn't exist, which usually relates to the behavior of the original function.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Find the Inverse Function:**  \n   - Compute \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) and determine where it's undefined.\n   \n2. **Analyze the Original Function's Domain and Range:**  \n   - Identify where \\( f(x) \\) is undefined and how it affects \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n   \n3. **Look for Points Where the Inverse Doesn't Exist:**  \n   - Examine values of \\( x \\) that make \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) undefined by analyzing \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAnalyzing the original function's domain and range seems more straightforward. Let's proceed with that approach.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Original Function \\( f(x) \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- \\( f(x) = \\frac{x-3}{x-4} \\) is a rational function.\n- Rational functions are undefined where the denominator is zero.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\nx - 4 = 0 \\implies x = 4\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **At \\( x = 4 \\),** \\( f(x) \\) is undefined, indicating a vertical asymptote.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis tells us that \\( f(x) \\) is undefined at \\( x = 4 \\), but we need to explore how this impacts \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the Inverse Function\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- The inverse function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) swaps the roles of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n- Therefore, the domain of \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is the range of \\( f(x) \\).\n- I need to find the range of \\( f(x) \\) to see where \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is undefined.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nTo find the range, let's rearrange the equation to express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\).\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Range of \\( f(x) \\)\n\n**Calculation:**  \nStarting with:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{x-3}{x-4}\n\\]\nMultiply both sides by \\( x-4 \\):\n\\[\ny(x-4) = x-3\n\\]\nExpand and rearrange:\n\\[\nyx - 4y = x - 3 \\implies yx - x = 4y - 3 \\implies x(y - 1) = 4y - 3\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4y - 3}{y - 1}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis equation shows that \\( x \\) is undefined when \\( y - 1 = 0 \\), i.e., \\( y = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) \\) cannot take the value \\( y = 1 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **At \\( y = 1 \\),** \\( f(x) \\) is undefined.\n- Consequently, \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is undefined at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Solution\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's confirm that \\( f(x) \\) can never equal \\( 1 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \nSet \\( f(x) = 1 \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{x-3}{x-4} = 1 \\implies x - 3 = x - 4 \\implies 0 = -1\n\\]\n \n**Conclusion:**  \nThis results in a contradiction (\\( 0 = -1 \\)), meaning \\( f(x) \\) can never be \\( 1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. Since \\( f(x) \\) cannot be \\( 1 \\), \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is undefined at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n### Final Check\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIs there any other point where \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) could be undefined? Given that \\( f(x) \\) is only undefined at \\( x = 4 \\) and \\( f(x) \\) can never be \\( 1 \\), \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is undefined only at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI feel confident that \\( x = 1 \\) is the only value where \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is undefined.\n\n### Answer\n\n\\(<ANSWER>\\)  \n\\( x = 1 \\)  \n\\(<ANSWER>\\)\n\n**Solution:**  \nThe inverse function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is undefined at \\( x = 1 \\) because the original function \\( f(x) = \\frac{x-3}{x-4} \\) can never take the value \\( 1 \\). Therefore, \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) has no corresponding output for \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n### Summary\n\nBy analyzing \\( f(x) \\), we found that:\n\n- \\( f(x) \\) is undefined at \\( x = 4 \\).\n- \\( f(x) \\) can never equal \\( 1 \\).\n\nConsequently, \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is undefined at \\( x = 1 \\) because there is no input in \\( f(x) \\) that produces an output of \\( 1 \\).\n\n---\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to work through.",
  "ground_truth": "We start by finding the inverse function of $f$. By definition, we know that $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$, so $$\\frac{f^{-1}(x)-3}{f^{-1}(x)-4} = x.$$We can solve this equation for $f^{-1}(x)$. First we multiply both sides by $f^{-1}(x)-4$: $$f^{-1}(x)-3 = x\\cdot(f^{-1}(x)-4).$$Then we expand: $$f^{-1}(x)-3 = x\\cdot f^{-1}(x)-4x.$$Then we rearrange so as to group all terms involving $f^{-1}(x)$ on the left side: $$f^{-1}(x)-x\\cdot f^{-1}(x) = 3-4x.$$We can factor on the left side: $$f^{-1}(x)\\cdot (1-x) = 3-4x.$$Finally, we divide both sides by $1-x$ to obtain our inverse function, $$f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{3-4x}{1-x}.$$This function is defined for all $x$ except $\\boxed{1}$."
