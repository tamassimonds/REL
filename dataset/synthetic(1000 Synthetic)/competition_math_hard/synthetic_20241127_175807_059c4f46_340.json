  "problem": "How many different positive three-digit integers can be formed using only the digits in the set $\\{2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6\\}$ if no digit may be used more times than it appears in the given set of available digits?",
  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's weave this step-by-step reflection into a cohesive, polished solution while retaining the final answer. Here's how we can present it seamlessly:\n\n---\n\n## **How Many Different Positive Three-Digit Integers Can Be Formed Using the Digits from the Set \\(\\{2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6\\}\\)?**\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen faced with forming positive three-digit integers using the digits from \\(\\{2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6\\}\\), each digit can only be used as frequently as it appears. Initial instincts suggest approaching this like permutation problems with repeated elements, but uncertainty lingers. To verify, let's explore possible strategies:\n\n1. **Permutations with Repetition**\n2. **Combination of Unique Digits**\n3. **Listing Possibilities Manually**\n4. **Using Combinatorics Formulas**\n\nAfter considering each, **Strategy 2: Combination of Unique Digits** seems the most manageable. It allows better control over digit usage by selecting them first before arranging.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying Possible Combinations of Digits**\n\nTo form three-digit numbers, let's categorize the cases based on digit repetition:\n\n1. **All Three Digits Are Different**\n2. **Two Digits Are the Same, One Is Different**\n3. **All Three Digits Are the Same**\n\nGiven our set, only digits 5 and 6 repeat sufficiently. Thus, all cases need careful consideration, including the possibility of all three digits being the same only for the number 555.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Case 1 - All Three Digits Are Different**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSelect three different digits from the unique set \\(\\{2, 3, 5, 6\\}\\) and arrange them.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Selecting Three Different Digits:**\n  \\[\n  \\binom{4}{3} = 4 \\text{ ways}\n  \\]\n  - Combinations: \\{2, 3, 5\\}, \\{2, 3, 6\\}, \\{2, 5, 6\\}, \\{3, 5, 6\\}\n  \n- **Arranging Each Selection:**\n  \\[\n  3! = 6 \\text{ arrangements per selection}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Total for Case 1:**\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 6 = 24 \\text{ numbers}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nListing examples confirms accuracy:\n- For \\{2, 3, 5\\}: 235, 253, 325, 352, 523, 532\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Case 2 - Two Digits Are the Same, One Is Different**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIdentify digits that can repeat and pair them with a different digit.\n\n#### **Sub-case 2.1: Repeating Digit is 5**\n\n- **Possible Third Digits:** 2, 3, or 6\n- **Arrangements per Choice:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3!}{2!} = 3 \\text{ arrangements}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Total for Sub-case 2.1:**\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ numbers}\n  \\]\n  \n**Example Numbers:**\n- With 2: 255, 525, 552\n- With 3: 355, 535, 553\n- With 6: 655, 565, 556\n\n#### **Sub-case 2.2: Repeating Digit is 6**\n\n- **Possible Third Digits:** 2, 3, or 5\n- **Arrangements per Choice:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3!}{2!} = 3 \\text{ arrangements}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Total for Sub-case 2.2:**\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 3 = 9 \\text{ numbers}\n  \\]\n  \n**Example Numbers:**\n- With 2: 266, 626, 662\n- With 3: 366, 636, 663\n- With 5: 566, 656, 665\n\n**Total for Case 2:**\n\\[\n9 + 9 = 18 \\text{ numbers}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nListing examples verifies correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Case 3 - All Three Digits Are the Same**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nOnly digit 5 appears three times, allowing for the number 555.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Only Possible Number:** 555\n- **Total for Case 3:** 1 number\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIncluding this ensures completeness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Summing Up All Cases**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Case 1:} & \\quad 24 \\text{ numbers} \\\\\n\\text{Case 2:} & \\quad 18 \\text{ numbers} \\\\\n\\text{Case 3:} & \\quad 1 \\text{ number} \\\\\n\\text{Total:} & \\quad 24 + 18 + 1 = 43 \\text{ different three-digit integers}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAdding all cases yields a total of 43. Quick checks confirm the reasonableness of this number.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{43 \\text{ different positive three-digit integers can be formed.}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore concluding, ensure all possible cases are considered and calculations are correct.\n\n- **Did all strategies align?** Yes, Strategy 2 effectively managed digit repetition.\n- **Are the calculations accurate?** Yes, each case was meticulously handled.\n- **Is the total reasonable?** Yes, considering the constraints of the digit set.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n\nNo zero in the set ensures all numbers are valid three-digit integers, eliminating concerns about leading zeros.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe approach is sound, and the final answer of 43 different integers is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{43 \\text{ different positive three-digit integers can be formed.}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nBy thoughtfully exploring, reflecting, and verifying each step, we've confidently determined that **43** different positive three-digit integers can be formed using the given digit set. This structured approach ensures accuracy and completeness, affirming the final solution.",
  "ground_truth": "If all three digits are different, there are 4 choices for the first digit, 3 for the second, and 2 for the third, giving $(4)(3)(2) = 24$ integers. If two of them are the same, the repeated digit digit is either 5 or 6. There are 2 choices for the repeated digit, then 3 choices for the non-repeating digit, and 3 ways to arrange these digits (for example, if the repeating digit is 5 and the non-repeating digit is 6, we can have 655, 565, and 556). This gives $(2)(3)(3) = 18$ integers. Finally, if all three digits are the same, the number must be 555. So there are $24+18+1 = \\boxed{43}$ possible integers."
