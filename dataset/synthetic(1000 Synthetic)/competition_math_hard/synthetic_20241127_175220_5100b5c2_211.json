  "solution": "Certainly! Let's put everything together into a cohesive and complete solution, maintaining the original final answer. I'll ensure clarity and coherence throughout the process.\n\n---\n\n**Alright, let's dive into this problem as if I'm thinking it through step by step, just like I would on paper. I'll brainstorm, check my work, and adjust my approach as needed to arrive at the final solution.**\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, I'm presented with a question involving the difference between the product of 4 and a number, subtracted from 16, being greater than 10. My goal is to determine how many positive integers satisfy this condition.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This sounds like an inequality problem involving multiplication and subtraction.\n- **Possible Strategies:** I could set up an equation or inequality to represent the situation. Maybe test out some numbers to get a feel for it.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- I need to express the condition mathematically.\n- It might involve setting up an inequality.\n- Checking different strategies like direct substitution or algebraic manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### **Translating the Problem into an Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to convert the word problem into a mathematical statement to make it easier to work with.\n\n- **Wait, How Do I Write This?** The product of 4 and a number... let's call the number \\( x \\).\n- So, \\( 4x \\) is the product.\n- Subtracted from 16 means \\( 16 - 4x \\).\n- This difference needs to be greater than 10.\n\n**Writing It Out:**\n\n\\[\n16 - 4x > 10\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Does this inequality represent the problem? Yes, it seems correct. I've captured the essence of the question in mathematical terms.\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the Inequality**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( x \\) to find which positive integers satisfy the inequality.\n\n- **Wait, Should I Isolate \\( x \\)?** Yes, isolating \\( x \\) will help me determine its possible values.\n- I'll subtract 16 from both sides to simplify the inequality.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n16 - 4x - 16 > 10 - 16 \\\\\n-4x > -6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, now I have \\(-4x > -6\\). The next step is to isolate \\( x \\) by dealing with the negative coefficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Dealing with the Negative Coefficient**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI remember that when dividing or multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips.\n\n- **Oh, Right!** I need to divide both sides by \\(-4\\).\n- **Does the Sign Change?** Yes, dividing by a negative flips the inequality from > to <.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx < \\frac{-6}{-4} \\\\\nx < \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Simplifying \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) gives me 1.5. So, \\( x \\) must be less than 1.5. This makes sense given the original inequality.\n\n---\n\n### **Identifying Positive Integers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to find all positive integers less than 1.5.\n\n- **Wait, What Are Positive Integers?** Positive integers are whole numbers greater than zero.\n- So, I need to list integers less than 1.5.\n\n**Listing Integers:**\n\n- The only positive integer less than 1.5 is 1.\n\n**Reflection:** Is there any other positive integer that fits? No, only 1 satisfies \\( x < 1.5 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIt's always good to verify if the solution makes sense by plugging it back into the original condition.\n\n- **Quick Check:** If \\( x = 1 \\):\n  \\[\n  16 - 4(1) = 16 - 4 = 12\n  \\]\n  Which is greater than 10. So, it satisfies the condition.\n\n- **What If \\( x = 2 \\)?**\n  \\[\n  16 - 4(2) = 16 - 8 = 8\n  \\]\n  Which is not greater than 10. So, \\( x = 2 \\) doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\n**Conclusion:** Only \\( x = 1 \\) works.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI've solved the inequality, identified the valid positive integer, and verified that it satisfies the condition.\n\n- **Final Check:** Everything lines up; the only positive integer that works is 1.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** The approach was straightforward once the inequality was set up. Verifying with actual values helped confirm the solution.\n\n---\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nBy systematically translating the word problem into a mathematical inequality, solving for \\( x \\), and verifying the solution with actual values, I determined that the only positive integer satisfying the condition is **1**.",
  "ground_truth": "First, we have to figure out what the problem is asking. The words \"is greater than\" tell us that there's an inequality. To write it down in math notation, we start by defining a variable $n$ as the mystery number.\n\nThen the \"product of 4 and a number\" is $4n$, and the difference when this is subtracted from $16$ is $16-4n$. So, the inequality says that $$16-4n > 10.$$ To solve this inequality, we can start by subtracting $10$ from both sides: $$6-4n > 0.$$ Then we add $4n$ to both sides: $$6 > 4n.$$ Finally, we divide both sides by $4$ to get $$1\\dfrac 12 > n.$$ The only positive integer satisfying this inequality is $n=1$, so there is $\\boxed{1}$ such number."
