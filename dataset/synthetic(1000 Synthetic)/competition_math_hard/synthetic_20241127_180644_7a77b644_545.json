  "problem": "On an old-fashioned bicycle the front wheel has a radius of $2.5$ feet and the back wheel has a radius of $4$ inches.  If there is no slippage, how many revolutions will the back wheel make while the front wheel makes $100$ revolutions?",
  "solution": "Sure, let's put all the thinking and steps together into a polished and coherent solution, reflecting a genuine problem-solving process.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have a bicycle with two wheels of different sizes:\n\n- **Front Wheel Radius:** 2.5 feet\n- **Back Wheel Radius:** 4 inches\n\nThe front wheel makes **100 revolutions** with **no slippage**. We need to determine how many revolutions the back wheel makes during this time.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The revolutions are linked to the wheels' circumferences since each revolution covers a distance equal to the circumference.\n- Calculating circumferences and the total distance traveled seems essential.\n- Converting units might be necessary since the radii are in different measurements.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Circumferences**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find out how much distance each wheel covers per revolution, we need to calculate their circumferences using the formula:\n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi \\times \\text{radius}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Front Wheel Circumference:**\n   \\[\n   C_{\\text{front}} = 2\\pi \\times 2.5\\, \\text{feet} = 5\\pi\\, \\text{feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Back Wheel Circumference:**\n   - The radius is given in **inches**, so let's convert it to **feet** to maintain consistency:\n     \\[\n     4\\, \\text{inches} = \\frac{4}{12}\\, \\text{feet} = \\frac{1}{3}\\, \\text{feet}\n     \\]\n   \\[\n   C_{\\text{back}} = 2\\pi \\times \\frac{1}{3}\\, \\text{feet} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\, \\text{feet}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Now, both circumferences are in feet:\n  - Front Wheel: \\(5\\pi\\) feet\n  - Back Wheel: \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\) feet\n- This consistency in units will help avoid calculation errors later.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining Total Distance Traveled by the Front Wheel**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince the front wheel makes **100 revolutions**, we can calculate the total distance it travels:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = \\text{Number of Revolutions} \\times C_{\\text{front}}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = 100 \\times 5\\pi\\, \\text{feet} = 500\\pi\\, \\text{feet}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Each revolution covers \\(5\\pi\\) feet, so over 100 revolutions, the total distance is indeed \\(500\\pi\\) feet.\n- This makes sense, confirming the calculation is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Number of Revolutions for the Back Wheel**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe back wheel must cover the same total distance of \\(500\\pi\\) feet. To find out how many revolutions it makes, we use:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Revolutions} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{C_{\\text{back}}}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Revolutions} = \\frac{500\\pi\\, \\text{feet}}{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\, \\text{feet}} = \\frac{500\\pi \\times 3}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1500\\pi}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1500}{2} = 750\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Multiplying \\(500\\pi\\) by 3 and dividing by \\(2\\pi\\) simplifies to \\(750\\).\n- The \\(\\pi\\) terms cancel out, leaving a clean numerical answer.\n- This confirms that the back wheel makes **750 revolutions**.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Using the Ratio of Circumferences**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAnother way to solve this is by examining the ratio of the circumferences:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{C_{\\text{front}}}{C_{\\text{back}}} = \\frac{5\\pi}{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}} = \\frac{5\\pi \\times 3}{2\\pi} = \\frac{15\\pi}{2\\pi} = \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5\n\\]\n\nThis ratio tells us that for every revolution of the front wheel, the back wheel makes **7.5 revolutions**.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n100 \\times 7.5 = 750\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Both methods\u2014direct calculation and ratio analysis\u2014yield the same result.\n- This consistency reinforces the correctness of the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n\n- The back wheel is smaller in radius, so it needs to rotate more times to cover the same distance as the larger front wheel.\n- A factor of 7.5 aligns with the size difference, making the solution logical.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER>The back wheel will make **750 revolutions** while the front wheel makes 100 revolutions.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy calculating the circumferences and understanding the relationship between the distances covered by both wheels, we've determined that the back wheel makes **750 revolutions**. Exploring multiple strategies and verifying each step ensured the accuracy of the solution.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",
  "ground_truth": "The circumference of the front wheel is $2\\pi \\cdot 2.5=5\\pi$ feet. In 100 revolutions, the front wheel travels $5\\pi \\cdot 100 = 500\\pi$ feet. The back wheel must travel the same distance because they are both attached to the same bike. The circumference of the back wheel is $2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ feet (note that 4 inches is equal to $\\frac{1}{3}$ feet). Thus, the number of revolutions of the back wheel is $\\frac{500\\pi}{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi}=\\boxed{750}$."
