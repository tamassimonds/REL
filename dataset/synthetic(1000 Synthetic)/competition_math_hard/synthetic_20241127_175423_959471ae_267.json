  "problem": "Henry's Hamburger Heaven offers its hamburgers with the following condiments: ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, tomato, lettuce, pickles, cheese, and onions. A customer can choose one, two, or three meat patties, and any collection of condiments. How many different kinds of hamburgers can be ordered?",
  "solution": "Sure, let\u2019s streamline the thought process into a clear and complete solution while keeping the original answer intact.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem Statement**\n\nAt Henry's Hamburger Heaven, customers can choose from eight condiments and have the option of ordering one, two, or three patties. The goal is to determine how many different kinds of hamburgers can be ordered.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, this problem reminds me of combinatorial math involving combinations and permutations. We'll need to consider all possible combinations of condiments alongside the different patty options. But does every hamburger need at least one condiment, or can it have none? To be thorough, I'll assume that a hamburger can have no condiments as well.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Calculate Condiment Combinations First**\n\n- **Condiments:** There are eight: ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, tomato, lettuce, pickles, cheese, and onions.\n- Each condiment can either be included or not, making it a binary choice.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis setup resembles calculating all subsets of condiments, which can be efficiently handled using the binomial theorem.\n\n**Strategy 2: Use the Binomial Theorem**\n\n- Each condiment has two options: included or not.\n- Therefore, the total number of condiment combinations is \\(2^8\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nFor a smaller case:  \n- With 2 condiments, \\(2^2 = 4\\) combinations (none, ketchup only, mustard only, both).  \nThis confirms that \\(2^8 = 256\\) is correct for eight condiments.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Condiment Combinations**\n\n\\[ \n2^8 = 256 \\text{ total condiment combinations}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis includes all possibilities, from no condiments to all eight being used.\n\n### **Step 2: Accounting for Patty Options**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, each of these condiment combinations can be paired with any of the three patty options: one, two, or three patties.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ \n256 \\text{ condiment combinations} \\times 3 \\text{ patty options} = 768 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBy multiplying the number of condiment combinations by the number of patty choices, we account for every possible hamburger configuration.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nUsing a simplified example:  \n- Suppose there are 4 condiment combinations and 2 patty options:  \n  \\[ \n  4 \\times 2 = 8 \\text{ total combinations} \n  \\]  \nListing them confirms correctness.\n\n### **Strategy Validation**\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nConsider calculating the total combinations for each patty choice separately and then summing them.\n\n- **But wait...**  \n  The condiment combinations remain the same regardless of the number of patties. Therefore, multiplying the total condiment combinations by the number of patty options is indeed the most efficient method.\n\n**Reassurance:**  \nThis confirms that the initial strategy is correct and avoids unnecessary complexity.\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\n\\[ \n256 \\text{ condiment combinations} \\times 3 \\text{ patty options} = 768 \\text{ total hamburger combinations} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEvery condiment combination is compatible with each patty option, leading to a total of 768 unique hamburger configurations.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>768 different kinds of hamburgers can be ordered at Henry's Hamburger Heaven.</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Check:**  \nThe approach holds up under simplified scenarios, ensuring that the calculation is accurate. Each step logically follows from the previous one, confirming the correctness of the final answer.\n\n---\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, validating each step with quick checks, and ensuring that the approach aligns with combinatorial principles, we've confidently arrived at the solution: **768 unique hamburger combinations** are possible at Henry's Hamburger Heaven.",
  "ground_truth": "A customer makes one of two choices for each condiment, to include it or not to include it. The choices are made independently, so there are $2^8 = 256$ possible combinations of condiments. For each of those combinations there are three choices regarding the number of meat patties, so there are altogether $(3)(256)=\\boxed{768}$ different kinds of hamburgers."
