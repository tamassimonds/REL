  "ground_truth": "Note that the area is given by Heron's formula and it is $20\\sqrt{221}$. Let $h_i$ denote the length of the altitude dropped from vertex i. It follows that $h_b = \\frac{40\\sqrt{221}}{27}, h_c  = \\frac{40\\sqrt{221}}{30}, h_a = \\frac{40\\sqrt{221}}{23}$. From similar triangles we can see that $\\frac{27h}{h_a}+\\frac{27h}{h_c} \\le 27 \\rightarrow h \\le \\frac{h_ah_c}{h_a+h_c}$. We can see this is true for any combination of a,b,c and thus the minimum of the upper bounds for h yields $h = \\frac{40\\sqrt{221}}{57} \\rightarrow \\boxed{318}$."
