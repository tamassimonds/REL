  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and adjust my approach as needed. Here's how I'll proceed:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, okay. The problem involves two functions:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = 3x^2 - 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\ng(f(x)) = x^2 + x + 1\n\\]\n\nWe're asked to find the sum of all possible values of \\( g(25) \\).\n\nInitially, I'm thinking this looks like a composition of functions problem. Maybe I need to find \\( g(y) \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and then evaluate \\( g(25) \\). But wait, since \\( g(f(x)) = x^2 + x + 1 \\), perhaps I can express \\( g \\) in terms of \\( f(x) \\) first.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Express \\( g(y) \\) in terms of \\( y = f(x) \\):**  \n   This might help me find \\( g(25) \\) by relating it back to \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Find \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 25 \\):**  \n   If \\( f(x) = 25 \\), then \\( g(25) = x^2 + x + 1 \\). This seems promising.\n\n3. **Use Inverse Functions:**  \n   Maybe find the inverse of \\( f(x) \\) to relate \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nI'm leaning towards the second strategy\u2014finding \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 25 \\)\u2014because it directly connects \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(25) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Solving \\( f(x) = 25 \\)**\n\nLet's set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = 3x^2 - 2 = 25\n\\]\n\nAdding 2 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n3x^2 = 27\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 9\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = 3 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, so we have two possible values for \\( x \\): \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\). This makes sense because squaring either positive or negative 3 gives us 9.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating \\( g(25) \\) Using Both \\( x \\) Values**\n\nNow, according to \\( g(f(x)) = x^2 + x + 1 \\), for each \\( x \\) that satisfies \\( f(x) = 25 \\), \\( g(25) = x^2 + x + 1 \\).\n\nLet's compute \\( g(25) \\) for both \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\).\n\n**For \\( x = 3 \\):**\n\n\\[\ng(25) = 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13\n\\]\n\n**For \\( x = -3 \\):**\n\n\\[\ng(25) = (-3)^2 + (-3) + 1 = 9 - 3 + 1 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI got two different values for \\( g(25) \\): 13 and 7. This aligns with having two roots for \\( x \\). It seems correct so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Sum of All Possible Values of \\( g(25) \\)**\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of all possible values of \\( g(25) \\). From the previous step, we have:\n\n\\[\ng(25) = 13 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g(25) = 7\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum is:\n\n\\[\n13 + 7 = 20\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nAdding 13 and 7 indeed gives 20. This seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy Check**\n\nJust to be sure, let's briefly consider if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using inverse functions or expressing \\( g(y) \\) differently. However, the initial strategy was straightforward and worked well, so I think sticking with it is fine.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSince the initial approach yielded consistent and correct results, there's no need to complicate things further. Sometimes, the simplest method is the best.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(\\boxed{20}\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy setting \\( f(x) = 25 \\) and solving for \\( x \\), we found two possible values:\n\n\\[\nx = 3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -3\n\\]\n\nEvaluating \\( g(25) \\) for both \\( x \\) values gave us:\n\n\\[\ng(25) = 13 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g(25) = 7\n\\]\n\nAdding these together, the final sum is:\n\n\\[\n13 + 7 = 20\n\\]\n\nThroughout the process, I checked each step to ensure correctness, and the consistency of the results confirmed that the approach was valid.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's it! By thinking through the problem step by step, reflecting on each part, and verifying the results, we arrived at the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "We don't know $g(x)$, so we don't have an expression we can simply stick $25$ in to get an answer. We do, however, know that $g(f(x)) =x^2 + x + 1$.  So, if we can figure out what to put into $f(x)$ such that $25$ is the resulting output, we can use our expression for $g(f(x))$ to find $g(25)$.\n\nIf $f(x) = 25$, then we have $3x^2 - 2 = 25$, so $x^2 = 9$, which means $x=3$ or $x=-3$.  Since $x$ could be $3$ or $-3$, we could have $g(25) = g(f(3))$ or $g(25) = g(f(-3))$.  Using the given expression for $g(f(x))$, the two possible values of $g(25)$ are  $g(f(3)) = 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 13$ and $g(f(-3)) = (-3)^2 + (-3) + 1 = 7$.  The sum of these is $13+7=\\boxed{20}$."
