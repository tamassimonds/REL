  "solution": "Absolutely, let's consolidate the entire thought process into a cohesive and complete solution while maintaining the original answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst Thoughts:  \nAlright, the question asks us to find all \\( x \\) such that both \\( 2x \\) and \\( 3x \\) lie within the interval \\( (1, 2) \\). At first glance, this seems like a problem involving inequalities where we need to satisfy multiple conditions simultaneously.\n\nInitial Reaction:  \nHmm, it reminds me of solving systems of inequalities. Maybe tackling each inequality separately and then identifying their overlap would be a good strategy. Let's explore this approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Separate Inequalities:**  \n   - Solve \\( 2x \\) within \\( (1, 2) \\).  \n   - Solve \\( 3x \\) within \\( (1, 2) \\).  \n   - Find the intersection of the solutions to satisfy both conditions.\n\n2. **Graphical Approach:**  \n   - Visualize both inequalities on a number line to identify the overlapping region.\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:**  \n   - Possibly combine the inequalities into a single expression, but that might complicate things.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe first strategy\u2014solving each inequality separately\u2014seems the most straightforward and reliable. Let's start there and see if it leads us to the solution. If it doesn\u2019t work, we can consider the graphical approach as a backup.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Solving the First Inequality \\( 2x \\in (1, 2) \\)**\n\nThought Process:  \nLet's tackle the first inequality. We need to find \\( x \\) values that, when multiplied by 2, result in numbers between 1 and 2.\n\nCalculations:  \n\\[\n1 < 2x < 2\n\\]\nTo isolate \\( x \\), divide all parts of the inequality by 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} < x < 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nQuick Verification:  \n- For \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\):  \n  - \\( 2x = 1 \\) \u2192 This is the lower boundary.\n- For \\( x = 1 \\):  \n  - \\( 2x = 2 \\) \u2192 This is the upper boundary.\n\nBoth points are at the limits, so the inequality \\( \\frac{1}{2} < x < 1 \\) makes sense.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis part seems correct. We've successfully narrowed down \\( x \\) for the first condition. Let's proceed to the second inequality.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Second Inequality \\( 3x \\in (1, 2) \\)**\n\nThought Process:  \nNow, let's handle the second inequality. We need \\( x \\) such that multiplying by 3 yields results within the same interval.\n\nCalculations:  \n\\[\n1 < 3x < 2\n\\]\nDivide all parts by 3 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} < x < \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nQuick Verification:  \n- For \\( x = \\frac{1}{3} \\):  \n  - \\( 3x = 1 \\) \u2192 Lower boundary.\n- For \\( x = \\frac{2}{3} \\):  \n  - \\( 3x = 2 \\) \u2192 Upper boundary.\n\nAgain, both limits are correct, so \\( \\frac{1}{3} < x < \\frac{2}{3} \\) is valid.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth inequalities are now solved individually. The next step is to find the \\( x \\) values that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Time to look for the intersection.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Intersection of the Two Solutions**\n\nThought Process:  \nWe need to determine where the two intervals overlap since \\( x \\) must satisfy both \\( 2x \\in (1, 2) \\) and \\( 3x \\in (1, 2) \\).\n\nCalculations:  \nLet's list the intervals:\n\n- First inequality:  \n  \\(\\frac{1}{2} < x < 1\\)\n\n- Second inequality:  \n  \\(\\frac{1}{3} < x < \\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n**Overlap:**  \nThe overlap occurs where both conditions are true simultaneously. Visually or logically, this would be:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} < x < \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nQuick Verification:  \n- Does \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\) work?  \n  - \\( 2x = 1 \\) \u2192 Hits the lower boundary for the first inequality but doesn\u2019t satisfy \\( 3x > 1 \\).\n- Does \\( x = \\frac{2}{3} \\) work?  \n  - \\( 3x = 2 \\) \u2192 Hits the upper boundary for the second inequality but doesn\u2019t satisfy \\( 2x < 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the overlap is strictly between \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), excluding the endpoints.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis intersection makes sense. Only \\( x \\) values within \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) satisfy both inequalities simultaneously. But let's verify with a sample point to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution with a Sample Point**\n\nThought Process:  \nBefore finalizing, it's a good idea to test a value within the identified overlap to ensure both conditions are met.\n\nSample Check:  \nLet\u2019s choose \\( x = \\frac{3}{5} \\), which lies between \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nCalculations:  \n- For \\( 2x \\):  \n  \\[\n  2 \\times \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2\n  \\]\n  - This satisfies \\( 1 < 1.2 < 2 \\).\n\n- For \\( 3x \\):  \n  \\[\n  3 \\times \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{9}{5} = 1.8\n  \\]\n  - This satisfies \\( 1 < 1.8 < 2 \\).\n\n**Check:**  \nBoth conditions are satisfied for \\( x = \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe sample check confirms that our overlap interval is correct. Thus, the solution is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\\(\\frac{1}{2} < x < \\frac{2}{3}\\)  \n</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nBy systematically approaching the problem\u2014solving each inequality separately, finding their intersection, and verifying with a sample point\u2014we confidently determine that the set of all \\( x \\) satisfying both conditions is \\( \\frac{1}{2} < x < \\frac{2}{3} \\). This thorough process ensures the correctness of our solution.\n\n---\n\nThere you have it! By following a structured approach, reflecting at each step, and verifying the outcome, we've arrived at the complete and correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "If $1<2x<2$, then, dividing all the expressions in these inequalities by $2$, we have $\\frac{1}{2}<x<1$.\n\nIf $1<3x<2$, then, dividing all the expressions by $3$, we have $\\frac{1}{3}<x<\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nGiven that $x$ satisfies both inequalities, we must have $\\frac{1}{2}<x<\\frac{2}{3}$. In interval notation, the set of common solutions is $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{2}{3}\\right)}$."
