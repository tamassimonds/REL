  "solution": "Alright, let's put this all together into a cohesive, well-organized solution, just like I would if I were writing it up neatly after brainstorming and reflecting. I'll maintain the same thoroughness, ensuring each step flows naturally into the next. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we're asked to determine the domain of the function:\n\n\\[\nj(x) = \\frac{1}{x+8} + \\frac{1}{x^2+8} + \\frac{1}{x^3+8}\n\\]\n\nAt first glance, this looks like a rational function composed of three separate fractions. My initial thought is that the domain will include all real numbers except where any of the denominators are zero, since division by zero is undefined. But I should double-check\u2014perhaps there are other factors affecting the domain.\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nHmm, each term has its own denominator. I need to consider each one individually to ensure I don't miss anything. Let's proceed by exploring different strategies.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n### **Exploring Different Approaches**\n\n1. **Set Each Denominator to Zero:** Identify the values of \\(x\\) that make each denominator zero and exclude them from the domain.\n\n2. **Look for Common Factors:** Check if the denominators share common factors that could simplify the problem, but initially, they seem distinct.\n\n3. **Graphical Approach:** Visualize the function's graph to identify discontinuities, though this might be more time-consuming.\n\n4. **Use Interval Notation:** After identifying the problematic points, express the domain using interval notation.\n\n### **Preferred Strategy**\n\nI'll start with the first approach\u2014setting each denominator to zero\u2014as it seems straightforward. If this doesn't work, I can explore other methods.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Implementing the First Strategy**\n\n### **Setting Each Denominator to Zero**\n\nLet's find the values of \\(x\\) that make each denominator zero:\n\n1. **First Denominator: \\(x + 8 = 0\\)**\n\n   \\[\n   x = -8\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Denominator: \\(x^2 + 8 = 0\\)**\n\n   \\[\n   x^2 = -8 \\implies x = \\pm \\sqrt{-8} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}i\n   \\]\n\n   **Observation:** These solutions are imaginary. Since we're concerned with the real domain, these don't affect it.\n\n3. **Third Denominator: \\(x^3 + 8 = 0\\)**\n\n   \\[\n   x^3 = -8 \\implies x = -2\n   \\]\n\n### **Initial Findings**\n\nFrom the real numbers, only \\(x = -8\\) and \\(x = -2\\) make the denominators zero.\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because at \\(x = -8\\), the first term becomes undefined, and at \\(x = -2\\), the third term becomes undefined. The second denominator's zeros are imaginary, so they don't impact the real domain.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n### **Quick Check**\n\nLet me double-check: Are there any other \\(x\\) values that could cause issues? Since the denominators are distinct and only \\(x = -8\\) and \\(x = -2\\) yield real zeros, I think we're good.\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nBut wait\u2014what if there's some interaction between the terms that I'm missing? Hmm, each term is independent, so it's unlikely. Still, it's always good to be cautious.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Expressing the Domain in Interval Notation**\n\n### **Using Interval Notation**\n\nNow, let's express the domain by excluding \\(x = -8\\) and \\(x = -2\\) from the real numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Domain: } (-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, -2) \\cup (-2, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n### **Breaking It Down**\n\n- **\\((-\\infty, -8)\\):** All real numbers less than \\(-8\\).\n- **\\((-8, -2)\\):** All real numbers between \\(-8\\) and \\(-2\\).\n- **\\((-2, \\infty)\\):** All real numbers greater than \\(-2\\).\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nDoes this cover all possible real numbers except where the function is undefined? Yes, I think it does. But let's do a quick sanity check to be sure.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Sanity Check**\n\n### **Plugging in Sample Values**\n\nLet's test a few sample points to ensure the function is defined outside the excluded values:\n\n1. **\\(x = -9\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   j(-9) = \\frac{1}{-9 + 8} + \\frac{1}{(-9)^2 + 8} + \\frac{1}{(-9)^3 + 8} = \\frac{1}{-1} + \\frac{1}{89} + \\frac{1}{-721}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Result:** No division by zero\u2014function is defined.\n\n2. **\\(x = -5\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   j(-5) = \\frac{1}{-5 + 8} + \\frac{1}{(-5)^2 + 8} + \\frac{1}{(-5)^3 + 8} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{33} + \\frac{1}{-117}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Result:** No division by zero\u2014function is defined.\n\n3. **\\(x = 0\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   j(0) = \\frac{1}{0 + 8} + \\frac{1}{0^2 + 8} + \\frac{1}{0^3 + 8} = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Result:** All terms are defined.\n\n### **Checking Excluded Points**\n\n- **\\(x = -8\\):** The first term becomes \\(\\frac{1}{0}\\), which is undefined.\n- **\\(x = -2\\):** The third term becomes \\(\\frac{1}{0}\\), which is undefined.\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nEverything seems to check out. The function is defined for all real numbers except \\(x = -8\\) and \\(x = -2\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 7: Finalizing the Solution**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying our approach, and performing sanity checks, we've determined that the domain of the function is:\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, -2) \\cup (-2, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n### **<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, -2) \\cup (-2, \\infty)}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## **Step 8: Reflecting on the Process**\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorming Helped:** Starting with different strategies ensured that I considered all possibilities.\n  \n- **Verification Was Crucial:** Quick checks and sample calculations confirmed that the approach was correct.\n  \n- **Flexibility Is Key:** Initially focusing on real zeros and recognizing that imaginary solutions don't affect the real domain was important.\n  \n- **Sanity Checks Added Confidence:** Testing sample points reinforced the validity of the solution.\n\n### **Overall Reflection**\n\nTaking a structured, step-by-step approach allowed me to solve the problem accurately and efficiently. By considering multiple strategies, verifying each step, and performing sanity checks, I ensured that the final answer was correct.\n\n---\n\nAnd there we have it! A complete, coherent solution that thoroughly explores the problem, checks for correctness, and confidently arrives at the final answer.",
  "ground_truth": "We note that $j(x)$ is defined unless one or more of the denominators $x+8,~x^2+8,~x^3+8$ is equal to $0$.\n\nWe have $x+8=0$ if $x=-8$, and $x^3+8$ if $x=\\sqrt[3]{-8} = -2$. There is no real $x$ for which $x^2+8=0$. Therefore, the domain of $j(x)$ consists of all real $x$ except $-8$ and $-2$. As a union of intervals, this is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-8)\\cup (-8,-2)\\cup (-2,\\infty)}$."
