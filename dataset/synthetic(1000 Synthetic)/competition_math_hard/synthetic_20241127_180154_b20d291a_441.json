  "problem": "The graph of $y=\\frac{5x^2-9}{3x^2+5x+2}$ has a horizontal asymptote at $y=a$.  What is $a$?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll reflect on each part, brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see the function \n\n\\( y = \\frac{5x^2 - 9}{3x^2 + 5x + 2} \\),\n\nI notice it's a rational function\u2014a polynomial divided by another polynomial. The question asks for the horizontal asymptote at \n\n\\( y = a \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- This reminds me of previous problems involving horizontal asymptotes.\n\n- I vaguely remember that horizontal asymptotes relate to the behavior of the function as \n\n\\( x \\) approaches infinity.\n\n- Maybe I need to compare the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and denominator.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure yet. Let's explore a few strategies to see which one fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Analyzing the Degrees of the Polynomials**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I recall that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and denominator polynomials.\n\n- Let's see:\n\n  - **Numerator:** \n\n    \\( 5x^2 - 9 \\) \u2192 Degree 2\n\n  - **Denominator:** \n\n    \\( 3x^2 + 5x + 2 \\) \u2192 Degree 2\n\n- Since the degrees are the same, I think the horizontal asymptote should be the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Leading coefficient of the numerator: 5\n\n- Leading coefficient of the denominator: 3\n\n- So, \n\n\\( a = \\frac{5}{3} \\)\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- This seems right based on what I remember, but let's verify by trying another method to be sure.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Long Division**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To double-check, I can perform polynomial long division to see if the function approaches \n\n\\( \\frac{5}{3} \\) as \n\n\\( x \\) goes to infinity.\n\n- But wait, this might be overkill since the degrees are the same, and we've already found the asymptote through leading coefficients.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Actually, long division would give the same result, so maybe it's not necessary. But let's proceed with a simpler method to confirm.\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Simplifying the Expression for Large \\( x \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I can factor out the highest power of \n\n\\( x \\) from both the numerator and denominator to see what happens as \n\n\\( x \\) approaches infinity.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Factor \n\n\\( x^2 \\) from both the numerator and denominator:\n\n  \n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5x^2 - 9}{3x^2 + 5x + 2} = \\frac{x^2(5 - \\frac{9}{x^2})}{x^2(3 + \\frac{5}{x} + \\frac{2}{x^2})}\n\\]\n\n  \n\n  \n\n- Simplify by canceling \n\n\\( x^2 \\):\n\n  \n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5 - \\frac{9}{x^2}}{3 + \\frac{5}{x} + \\frac{2}{x^2}}\n\\]\n\n  \n\n  \n\n- As \n\n\\( x \\to \\infty \\), \n\n\\( \\frac{9}{x^2} \\to 0 \\), \n\n\\( \\frac{5}{x} \\to 0 \\), and \n\n\\( \\frac{2}{x^2} \\to 0 \\).\n\n  \n\n- So, the expression simplifies to \n\n\\( \\frac{5}{3} \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- This confirms our earlier result. Both methods agree that \n\n\\( a = \\frac{5}{3} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBoth strategies\u2014analyzing the degrees and simplifying the expression for large \n\n\\( x \\)\u2014lead to the same conclusion. This consistency gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\n**But wait, let's think deeper:**\n\n- Is there any other aspect I might be missing?\n\n- Could there be exceptions or special cases in the function that affect the asymptote?\n\n**Additional Check:**\n\n- Since the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal, and no holes or discontinuities are present at infinity, the horizontal asymptote is indeed determined by the leading coefficients.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n<ANSWER> solution\n  \n\\( a = \\frac{5}{3} \\)</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring multiple strategies and verifying the consistency between them, I've confidently determined that the horizontal asymptote of the given function is \n\n\\( y = \\frac{5}{3} \\). \n\nReflecting at each step ensured that no details were overlooked, and checking the work solidified the correctness of the solution.",
  "ground_truth": "To determine the horizontal asymptotes, we consider what happens as $x$ becomes very large.  It appears that, as $x$ becomes very large, the rational function becomes more and more like  \\[y\\approx\\frac{5x^2}{3x^2},\\]so it should become closer and closer to $\\frac53$.\n\nWe can see this explicitly by dividing both the numerator and denominator by $x^2$.  This gives  \\[y=\\frac{5-\\frac{9}{x^2}}{3+\\frac{5}{x}+\\frac{2}{x^2}}.\\]Indeed, as $x$ gets larger, all of the terms other than 5 in the numerator and 3 in the denominator become very small, so the horizontal asymptote is $y=\\boxed{\\frac53}$."
