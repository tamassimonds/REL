  "solution": "### Tackling the Quadratic Equation Step by Step\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem just like we would if we were solving it on paper. We\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check our work along the way to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we have the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ 10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0 \\]\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest positive value of \\( m \\) that makes this equation have integral (integer) solutions.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- This reminds me of quadratic equations with integer roots. Maybe using the **Quadratic Formula** or **Vieta's Formulas** could be helpful.\n- Another approach could be ensuring the **discriminant** is a perfect square since that\u2019s necessary for integral solutions.\n- Factoring the quadratic might also work, but with a leading coefficient of 10, it could get a bit tricky.\n\nNot completely sure which method is best yet, so I'll explore a few to see which one leads me in the right direction.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Using the Discriminant**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIntegral solutions occur when the discriminant (\\( \\Delta \\)) is a perfect square. Let's recall that for a quadratic \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\]\n\nFor our equation:\n\n\\[ a = 10, \\quad b = -m, \\quad c = 420 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\Delta = m^2 - 16800 \\]\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\nIf \\( \\Delta \\) needs to be a perfect square for integral solutions, then:\n\n\\[ m^2 - 16800 = k^2 \\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\).\n\nThis resembles a **difference of squares**:\n\n\\[ m^2 - k^2 = 16800 \\]\n\\[ (m - k)(m + k) = 16800 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems promising. By factoring 16800 into pairs \\((m - k)\\) and \\((m + k)\\), we can find possible values for \\( m \\) and \\( k \\).\n\nBut before diving deep, let's see if there's a simpler way, perhaps through factoring the original quadratic.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Attempting to Factor the Quadratic**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf the quadratic can be factored as:\n\n\\[ (ax + b)(cx + d) = 0 \\]\n\nExpanding this should match our original equation. Let's assume:\n\n\\[ 10x^2 - mx + 420 = (10x + p)(x + q) \\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[ 10x^2 + (10q + p)x + pq = 0 \\]\n\nComparing coefficients:\n\n\\[ \n\\begin{align*}\n10q + p &= -m, \\\\\npq &= 420.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\nThis gives us two equations with two unknowns (\\( p \\) and \\( q \\)). If we can find integer values for \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) such that \\( pq = 420 \\), we can determine \\( m \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis method requires factoring 420 into integer pairs, which seems feasible. Let's list the factors of 420 and see if we can find suitable \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Using Vieta\u2019s Formulas**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nVieta\u2019s formulas relate the sum and product of the roots to the coefficients of the quadratic:\n\n- Sum of roots, \\( r_1 + r_2 = \\frac{m}{10} \\)\n- Product of roots, \\( r_1 \\times r_2 = \\frac{420}{10} = 42 \\)\n\nGiven that the roots are integers, their product is 42. So, we can list integer pairs whose product is 42.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems like a straightforward approach. By listing all integer pairs \\((r_1, r_2)\\) such that \\( r_1 \\times r_2 = 42 \\), we can calculate \\( m \\) for each pair and identify the smallest positive \\( m \\).\n\n**Decision:**\nI'll proceed with **Strategy 3** (Vieta\u2019s Formulas) because it directly connects the roots to \\( m \\) and seems the most straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementing Strategy 3: Vieta\u2019s Formulas**\n\n**Step 1: List Integer Pairs with Product 42**\n\nLet's list all integer pairs \\((r_1, r_2)\\) such that \\( r_1 \\times r_2 = 42 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(1, 42), \\\\\n(2, 21), \\\\\n(3, 14), \\\\\n(6, 7), \\\\\n(-1, -42), \\\\\n(-2, -21), \\\\\n(-3, -14), \\\\\n(-6, -7).\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\nSince we're looking for the smallest positive \\( m \\), we'll focus on the pairs where both roots are positive (or negative, but the same sign).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis ensures that the sum \\( r_1 + r_2 \\) is positive, leading to a positive \\( m \\).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate \\( m \\) for Each Pair**\n\nUsing Vieta\u2019s formula:\n\n\\[ r_1 + r_2 = \\frac{m}{10} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ m = 10 \\times (r_1 + r_2) \\]\n\nLet's calculate \\( m \\) for each positive pair:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(1, 42): & \\quad m = 10 \\times (1 + 42) = 430, \\\\\n(2, 21): & \\quad m = 10 \\times (2 + 21) = 230, \\\\\n(3, 14): & \\quad m = 10 \\times (3 + 14) = 170, \\\\\n(6, 7): & \\quad m = 10 \\times (6 + 7) = 130.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\nThe smallest \\( m \\) from these calculations is 130. But let's double-check to ensure there's no smaller value we might have missed.\n\n**Reflection:**\nAlways good to verify. Maybe consider negative pairs or double-check the calculations.\n\n**Alternative Check: Negative Pairs**\n\nLet's briefly consider negative pairs:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(-1, -42): & \\quad m = 10 \\times (-1 + (-42)) = -430, \\\\\n(-2, -21): & \\quad m = 10 \\times (-2 + (-21)) = -230, \\\\\n(-3, -14): & \\quad m = 10 \\times (-3 + (-14)) = -170, \\\\\n(-6, -7): & \\quad m = 10 \\times (-6 + (-7)) = -130.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nNegative \\( m \\) values aren't what we're looking for since the problem asks for the smallest **positive** \\( m \\).\n\n**Decision:**\nThe smallest positive \\( m \\) from the positive root pairs is **130**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, let's verify that \\( m = 130 \\) indeed makes the discriminant a perfect square and that the quadratic has integral solutions.\n\n**Step 1: Verify the Discriminant**\n\nFor \\( m = 130 \\):\n\n\\[ \n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta &= m^2 - 16800 \\\\\n&= 130^2 - 16800 \\\\\n&= 16900 - 16800 \\\\\n&= 100 \\\\\n&= 10^2 \\quad (\\text{a perfect square}).\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSince the discriminant is a perfect square, the quadratic equation has integral solutions. This confirms that \\( m = 130 \\) is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Solve the Quadratic Equation with \\( m = 130 \\)**\n\nLet's solve:\n\n\\[ 10x^2 - 130x + 420 = 0 \\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2a} = \\frac{130 \\pm 10}{20}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the roots:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1 &= \\frac{130 + 10}{20} = \\frac{140}{20} = 7, \\\\\nx_2 &= \\frac{130 - 10}{20} = \\frac{120}{20} = 6.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe roots are \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = 6 \\), both integers. This confirms that \\( m = 130 \\) is indeed the correct and smallest positive value.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies and thoroughly verifying each step, we confidently arrive at the solution:\n\n<ANSWER>solution\nThe smallest positive value of \\( m \\) such that the equation \\( 10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0 \\) has integral solutions is \\( \\boxed{130} \\).\\</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorming Different Strategies:** Initially considered the discriminant method and factoring, but Vieta\u2019s formulas provided a clear and straightforward path.\n  \n- **Reflecting and Checking:** Regular checks ensured the correctness of each step. Considering both positive and negative root pairs helped confirm the smallest positive \\( m \\).\n\n- **Verifying the Solution:** Calculating the discriminant and solving the quadratic with \\( m = 130 \\) validated the integrity of the solution.\n\nBy thinking through multiple strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying the final answer, we confidently arrive at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\nAlright, that's the complete, human-like thought process for tackling this problem.

  "ground_truth": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the solutions the the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$. We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively, so $p+q = m/10$ and $pq = 420/10 = 42$. Since $m = 10(p+q)$, we minimize $m$ by minimizing the sum $p+q$. Since $p$ and $q$ are integers and multiply to 42, the possible values of $(p,q)$ are $(1,42),(2,21),(3,14),(6,7),(7,6),(14,3),(21,2),(42,1)$. (Note that if $p$ and $q$ are both negative, then $p+q$ is negative, so $m$ would be negative, which is excluded by the problem.) The sum $p+q$ is minimized when $(p,q) = (6,7)$ or $(7,6)$. In either case, $m = 10(p+q) = 10(6+7) = \\boxed{130}.$"
