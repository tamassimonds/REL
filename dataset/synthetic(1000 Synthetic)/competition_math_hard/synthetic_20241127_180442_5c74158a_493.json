Hoses B and C together take 6 hours to fill the pool. How many hours does it take hoses A, B and C working together to fill the pool? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's piece everything together into a clear and coherent solution, emulating a natural problem-solving process while maintaining the original flow and thought checks. Here's how I'd approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first encounter this problem, it reminds me of **rate of work** scenarios where multiple agents contribute to a task. Each hose fills the pool at a specific rate, and we know how long different pairs of hoses take to fill the pool together. Our goal is to determine how long all three hoses would take working simultaneously.\n\n**Initial Idea:**  \nPerhaps I can determine the individual rates of each hose and then combine them to find the total rate. However, since the information provided only pertains to pairs of hoses, I'll need to devise a strategy to extract individual rates first.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Assign Variables to Each Hose\u2019s Rate:**  \n   Let's denote:\n   - \\( A \\) as the rate of hose A.\n   - \\( B \\) as the rate of hose B.\n   - \\( C \\) as the rate of hose C.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**  \n   From the problem:\n   - Hoses A and B together take 4 hours:\n     \\[\n     A + B = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ pool per hour}\n     \\]\n   - Hoses A and C together take 5 hours:\n     \\[\n     A + C = \\frac{1}{5}\n     \\]\n   - Hoses B and C together take 6 hours:\n     \\[\n     B + C = \\frac{1}{6}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Brainstorming on How to Solve:**  \n   With these three equations, I can attempt to solve for each hose's rate individually. Subtracting equations might help isolate one variable at a time.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis resembles a **system of linear equations**. Solving for individual rates seems like a viable approach, so let's proceed with that.\n\n### **Step 1: Solving for Individual Rates**\n\n**Subtract Equations to Isolate Variables:**\n\n- **Subtract the Second Equation from the First:**\n  \\[\n  (A + B) - (A + C) = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{5}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  B - C = \\frac{1}{20}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Thoughts:**  \n  This gives me a relationship between B and C: \\( B \\) is slightly faster than \\( C \\) by \\(\\frac{1}{20}\\) of the pool per hour.\n\n- **Subtract the Third Equation from the Second:**\n  \\[\n  (A + C) - (B + C) = \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{6}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  A - B = \\frac{1}{30}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Thoughts:**  \n  Now, I know \\( A \\) is faster than \\( B \\) by \\(\\frac{1}{30}\\) of the pool per hour.\n\n- **Subtract the First Equation from the Third:**\n  \\[\n  (B + C) - (A + B) = \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{4}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  C - A = -\\frac{1}{12}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Check:**  \n  This implies \\( A \\) is faster than \\( C \\) by \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) of the pool per hour. All relationships seem consistent so far.\n\n### **Step 2: Solving for One Variable**\n\n**Use Relationships to Find One Rate:**\n\nFrom \\( B - C = \\frac{1}{20} \\) and \\( A - B = \\frac{1}{30} \\), I can express \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) in terms of \\( A \\).\n\n- **Express B in Terms of A:**\n  \\[\n  A - B = \\frac{1}{30} \\implies B = A - \\frac{1}{30}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Thoughts:**  \n  Substituting this into another equation should help us find \\( C \\).\n\n- **Plug B into \\( B - C = \\frac{1}{20} \\):**\n  \\[\n  (A - \\frac{1}{30}) - C = \\frac{1}{20} \\implies A - C = \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{30}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  A - C = \\frac{1}{12}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Reflection:**  \n  This matches our earlier finding \\( C - A = -\\frac{1}{12} \\), confirming consistency in our relationships.\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Rate of A**\n\n**Combine Equations to Solve for A:**\n\nNow, let's use the original equations to solve for \\( A \\).\n\n- **Use \\( A + B = \\frac{1}{4} \\) and \\( B = A - \\frac{1}{30} \\):**\n  \\[\n  A + (A - \\frac{1}{30}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies 2A - \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{1}{4}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  2A = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{15}{60} + \\frac{2}{60} = \\frac{17}{60}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  A = \\frac{17}{120}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Thoughts:**  \n  We've successfully determined the rate of hose A. Let's proceed to find the rates of hoses B and C.\n\n### **Step 4: Finding Rates of B and C**\n\n**Use A\u2019s Rate to Find B and C:**\n\n- **Find B Using \\( A - B = \\frac{1}{30} \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{17}{120} - B = \\frac{1}{30} \\implies B = \\frac{17}{120} - \\frac{4}{120} = \\frac{13}{120}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Thoughts:**  \n  Hose B's rate is now determined. Next, let's find hose C's rate.\n\n- **Find C Using \\( B + C = \\frac{1}{6} \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{13}{120} + C = \\frac{1}{6} \\implies C = \\frac{20}{120} - \\frac{13}{120} = \\frac{7}{120}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Check:**  \n  Adding A and C:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{17}{120} + \\frac{7}{120} = \\frac{24}{120} = \\frac{1}{5}\n  \\]\n  This matches the given \\( A + C = \\frac{1}{5} \\), confirming our calculations are correct.\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the Combined Rate of A, B, and C**\n\n**Add All Three Rates Together:**\n\\[\nA + B + C = \\frac{17}{120} + \\frac{13}{120} + \\frac{7}{120} = \\frac{37}{120}\n\\]\n  \n**Interpretation:**  \nThis combined rate indicates that together, hoses A, B, and C fill \\(\\frac{37}{120}\\) of the pool per hour.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nTo find the total time required to fill the pool with all three hoses working together, we'll take the reciprocal of this combined rate.\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating the Time to Fill the Pool**\n\n**Take the Reciprocal to Find Time:**\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{120}{37} \\approx 3.24 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nDoes this result make sense? Considering each pair of hoses takes more time individually (4, 5, and 6 hours), it stands to reason that all three hoses working together would fill the pool even faster. Thus, approximately 3.24 hours is a logical outcome.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\n- **Hoses A and B:**  \n  Together, they fill the pool in 4 hours (\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) per hour).\n- **Hoses A and C:**  \n  Together, they take 5 hours (\\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) per hour).\n- **Hoses B and C:**  \n  Together, they require 6 hours (\\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) per hour).\n\nBy confirming that the individual rates of hoses A, B, and C satisfy all given conditions, we ensure that our solution is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n<ANSWER>3.24 hours</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough systematically assigning variables to each hose's rate and setting up a system of linear equations based on the provided information, we successfully determined the individual rates of hoses A, B, and C. By adding these rates together, we calculated the combined rate at which all three hoses fill the pool, leading us to the final answer of approximately 3.24 hours.\n\nThroughout the process, consistent **reflection** and **verification** ensured the correctness of each step, aligning the final outcome with the initial conditions of the problem.\n\n**Ending Note:**  \nBy approaching the problem methodically and continuously checking for consistency, we arrive at a reliable solution that satisfies all given constraints.",
  "ground_truth": "Let the rate that hose $A$ fills the pool be equal to $A$, and similarly for hoses $B$ and $C$.  Then, let $P$ be equal to the volume of the pool.  From the given information, we can write the equation $P=4(A+B)$, which just says the pool volume is equal to the rate it is being filled, multiplied by the time taken to fill it.  We can rewrite this as $\\frac{P}{4}=A+B$.  Doing this with the rest of the given information, we can write three equations: $$\\frac{P}{4}=A+B$$ $$\\frac{P}{5}=A+C$$ $$\\frac{P}{6}=B+C$$ Adding these three equations, we can simplify as shown: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{P}{4}+\\frac{P}{5}+\\frac{P}{6}&=(A+B)+(A+C)+(B+C)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{15P}{60}+\\frac{12P}{60}+\\frac{10P}{60}&=2(A+B+C)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 37P&=120(A+B+C)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad P&=\\frac{120}{37}(A+B+C)\n\\end{align*} Looking carefully at the final expression here, we can see that $A+B+C$ is the rate that the pool would be filled with all three hoses working together.  So, $\\frac{120}{37}\\approx \\boxed{3.24}$ is equal to the number of hours it would take all three hoses to fill the pool."
