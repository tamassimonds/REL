  "problem": "Simplify $\\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i}$. Your answer should be of the form $a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are both real numbers and written as improper fractions (if necessary).",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's refine the thought process and organize it into a polished, coherent solution while maintaining the original insights. We'll keep the conversational tone but streamline the narrative for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Simplifying \\(\\frac{3+4i}{1+2i}\\) into \\(a + bi\\)**\n\n---\n\n#### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem as if tackling it in real life. I need to simplify \\(\\frac{3+4i}{1+2i}\\) into the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers.\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:**  \n  This looks like a complex number division problem. I recall that involving the conjugate might be the way to go, but it's been a while. Let me explore a few strategies to see which one makes the most sense.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**  \n  1. **Use the Conjugate:** Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to eliminate the imaginary part.  \n  2. **Convert to Polar Form:** Converting both numbers to polar form and dividing might work, but that seems more complicated.  \n  3. **Direct Division:** Attempt dividing directly like regular binomials, but handling \\(i^2 = -1\\) might get messy.\n\n- **Reflecting on Strategies:**  \n  The conjugate method sounds familiar and straightforward for complex division. Polar form could work but feels like overkill. Direct division seems prone to errors.\n\n---\n\n#### **Choosing the Conjugate Method**\n\nGiven the options, I'll start with the **conjugate method**. If it doesn't work, I'll reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Multiplying by the Conjugate**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n\nTo eliminate the imaginary part from the denominator, I'll multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of \\(1 + 2i\\), which is \\(1 - 2i\\).\n\n**Action:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} \\times \\frac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yeah, multiplying by the conjugate should simplify the denominator.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n\nThe denominator becomes \\((1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)\\). I remember this is a difference of squares: \\(a^2 - b^2\\), where \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 2i\\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n(1)^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - (4i^2)\n\\]  \nSince \\(i^2 = -1\\), this becomes:  \n\\[\n1 - 4(-1) = 1 + 4 = 5\n\\]\n\n**Result:**  \nThe denominator simplifies to **5**.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDouble-checking: \\(i^2 = -1\\), so \\(4(-1) = -4\\), and \\(1 - (-4) = 5\\). Yep, that's correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Numerator**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n\nNow, I need to multiply the numerators: \\((3 + 4i)(1 - 2i)\\). I'll use the distributive property (FOIL method) to expand this.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n3(1) + 3(-2i) + 4i(1) + 4i(-2i)\n\\]  \nBreaking it down:  \n\\[\n= 3 - 6i + 4i - 8i^2\n\\]  \nSince \\(i^2 = -1\\), this becomes:  \n\\[\n= 3 - 6i + 4i - 8(-1)\n\\]  \n\\[\n= 3 - 6i + 4i + 8\n\\]  \n\\[\n= (3 + 8) + (-6i + 4i)\n\\]  \n\\[\n= 11 - 2i\n\\]\n\n**Result:**  \nThe numerator simplifies to **\\(11 - 2i\\)**.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nAdding real parts: \\(3 + 8 = 11\\).  \nAdding imaginary parts: \\(-6i + 4i = -2i\\).  \nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Putting It All Together**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n\nNow, I have \\(\\frac{11 - 2i}{5}\\). To express it in the form \\(a + bi\\), I'll divide both the real and imaginary parts by 5.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i\n\\]\n\n**Result:**  \nSo, the simplified form is **\\(\\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i\\)**.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, dividing both parts by 5 properly separates the real and imaginary components.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection: Is the Answer Correct?**\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  To verify, I could multiply \\(\\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i\\) by \\(1 + 2i\\) to see if I get back the original numerator \\(3 + 4i\\). However, since each step checked out logically, I'll trust my process.\n\n- **Confidence Level:**  \n  I'm confident that the conjugate method worked here. Each step was validated, leading to a correct final answer.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>\n\\[\n\\frac{3+4i}{1+2i} = \\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i\n\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies and selecting the conjugate method, I successfully simplified the complex fraction step by step. Regular checks ensured correctness at each stage, resulting in a confident final answer.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore!",
