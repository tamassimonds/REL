  "problem": "If we let $f(n)$ denote the sum of all the positive divisors of the integer $n$, how many integers $i$ exist such that $1 \\le i \\le 2010$ and $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, checking if they work, and adjusting as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the problem asks us to find how many integers \\( i \\) within the range \\( 1 \\leq i \\leq 2010 \\) satisfy the equation:\n\n\\[\nf(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( f(n) \\) denotes the sum of all positive divisors of \\( n \\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nHmm, this looks like a problem involving divisor sums and square roots. It reminds me of problems I've seen before involving perfect squares and divisor functions. Maybe there's a relationship between \\( i \\) and its divisors that can simplify this equation.\n\nBut honestly, at first glance, I'm not entirely sure how to approach it. It feels a bit tricky because of the square root involved. Let me brainstorm some strategies to get started.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Computation:**  \n   Calculate \\( f(i) \\) for each \\( i \\) from 1 to 2010 and check if the equation holds.\n\n   **Thoughts:**  \n   This would definitely work, but it seems very time-consuming and not practical without a computer program. Probably not the best approach manually.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Equation:**  \n   Rearrange the equation to see if there's a pattern or simplification.\n\n   **Thoughts:**  \n   Maybe rewriting the equation could help us see a relationship between \\( i \\), its divisors, and \\( \\sqrt{i} \\).\n\n3. **Exploring Perfect Squares:**  \n   Since \\( \\sqrt{i} \\) is involved, perhaps \\( i \\) needs to be a perfect square for the equation to make sense.\n\n   **Thoughts:**  \n   This seems promising because the square root of a non-perfect square would be irrational, and \\( f(i) \\) is always an integer. So, maybe only perfect squares would satisfy the equation.\n\n4. **Leveraging Properties of \\( f(n) \\):**  \n   Use known properties of the sum of divisors function to see if we can derive conditions on \\( i \\).\n\n   **Thoughts:**  \n   I recall that for perfect squares, the sum of divisors has certain properties. This might lead us to a solution.\n\n**Decision:**  \nI think exploring perfect squares is a good starting point since \\( \\sqrt{i} \\) must be an integer for the right side to be an integer. Let's proceed with this strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Assuming \\( i \\) is a Perfect Square**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nIf \\( i \\) is a perfect square, say \\( i = k^2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\), then \\( \\sqrt{i} = k \\), making the right side of the equation an integer:\n\n\\[\n1 + k + k^2\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThis simplifies things because now both sides of the equation are integers. Let's see if this leads us anywhere.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBut wait, before diving deeper, let's think about whether assuming \\( i \\) is a perfect square is too restrictive. Could there be non-perfect squares that satisfy the equation? \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nActually, since \\( \\sqrt{i} \\) needs to be an integer for the equation to hold (as \\( f(i) \\) is always an integer), \\( i \\) must be a perfect square. So, this assumption seems valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Rewriting the Equation for Perfect Squares**\n\nGiven \\( i = k^2 \\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(k^2) = 1 + k + k^2\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nNow, I need to recall how to express \\( f(k^2) \\), the sum of all positive divisors of \\( k^2 \\).\n\n**Brainstorm:**  \nI remember that if \\( n \\) is a perfect square, the sum of its divisors can be expressed in terms of its prime factors. Let's see if I can write that out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Expressing \\( f(k^2) \\) Using Prime Factors**\n\nSuppose \\( k \\) has the prime factorization:\n\n\\[\nk = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_m^{a_m}\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\nk^2 = p_1^{2a_1} p_2^{2a_2} \\cdots p_m^{2a_m}\n\\]\n\nThe sum of the divisors of \\( k^2 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nf(k^2) = \\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\left( 1 + p_j + p_j^2 + \\cdots + p_j^{2a_j} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThis formula looks a bit complicated. I'm not sure if it's leading me directly to what I need. Maybe there's a simpler way to express \\( f(k^2) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute, perhaps instead of getting bogged down in this general expression, I should look for specific values of \\( k \\) that satisfy the equation. This might help me see a pattern.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLet's try plugging in some small values of \\( k \\) to see if the equation holds and to identify any patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Testing Small Values of \\( k \\)**\n\n**Case 1:** Let \\( k = 1 \\)  \n\\[\ni = k^2 = 1\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(1) = 1 \\quad \\text{(since 1 is its only divisor)}\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 1 + 1^2 = 3\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(1) = 1 \\neq 3\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFor \\( k = 1 \\), the equation does not hold.\n\n**Case 2:** Let \\( k = 2 \\)  \n\\[\ni = k^2 = 4\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(4) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 2 + 4 = 7\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(4) = 7 = 7\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFor \\( k = 2 \\), the equation holds.\n\n**Case 3:** Let \\( k = 3 \\)  \n\\[\ni = k^2 = 9\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(9) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(9) = 13 = 13\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFor \\( k = 3 \\), the equation holds.\n\n**Case 4:** Let \\( k = 4 \\)  \n\\[\ni = k^2 = 16\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(16) = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 4 + 16 = 21\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(16) = 31 \\neq 21\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFor \\( k = 4 \\), the equation does not hold.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nHmm, it seems that for \\( k = 2 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\), the equation holds, but not for \\( k = 1 \\) or \\( k = 4 \\). This suggests that only certain perfect squares satisfy the equation.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nMaybe there's a specific condition that \\( k \\) must satisfy for the equation to hold. I need to investigate further to identify what that condition is.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Looking for a Pattern or General Condition**\n\nGiven that the equation holds for \\( k = 2 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\), let's see if we can identify a pattern.\n\n**Observation:**  \nFor \\( k = 2 \\):  \n\\[\nf(4) = 7 = 1 + 2 + 4\n\\]  \nFor \\( k = 3 \\):  \n\\[\nf(9) = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9\n\\]  \n\n**Pattern:**  \nIt appears that for these values of \\( k \\), the sum of all divisors of \\( k^2 \\) equals \\( 1 + k + k^2 \\). \n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThis might imply that \\( k^2 \\) has exactly three divisors: 1, \\( k \\), and \\( k^2 \\). If that's the case, then \\( k^2 \\) must be a perfect square of a prime number.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, let's think about this. If \\( k^2 \\) has exactly three divisors, it means that \\( k \\) itself must be a prime number. Therefore, \\( i = k^2 \\) where \\( k \\) is prime.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSo, the integers \\( i \\) that satisfy the equation are those that are perfect squares of prime numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Formalizing the Condition**\n\nGiven our observations, we can state that:\n\n\\[\ni = p^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( p \\) is a prime number.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThis makes sense because if \\( i \\) is the square of a prime, then its divisors are only 1, \\( p \\), and \\( p^2 \\), which aligns with the equation \\( f(i) = 1 + p + p^2 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis condition seems robust. Let's proceed to identify all such \\( i \\) within the given range.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Identifying All Perfect Squares of Primes Up to 2010**\n\n**Approach:**  \nList all prime numbers \\( p \\) such that \\( p^2 \\leq 2010 \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nI need to find all prime numbers whose squares are less than or equal to 2010. This will give us all the integers \\( i \\) that satisfy the equation.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nLet's list the prime numbers and their squares:\n\n- \\( p = 2 \\), \\( p^2 = 4 \\)\n- \\( p = 3 \\), \\( p^2 = 9 \\)\n- \\( p = 5 \\), \\( p^2 = 25 \\)\n- \\( p = 7 \\), \\( p^2 = 49 \\)\n- \\( p = 11 \\), \\( p^2 = 121 \\)\n- \\( p = 13 \\), \\( p^2 = 169 \\)\n- \\( p = 17 \\), \\( p^2 = 289 \\)\n- \\( p = 19 \\), \\( p^2 = 361 \\)\n- \\( p = 23 \\), \\( p^2 = 529 \\)\n- \\( p = 29 \\), \\( p^2 = 841 \\)\n- \\( p = 31 \\), \\( p^2 = 961 \\)\n- \\( p = 37 \\), \\( p^2 = 1369 \\)\n- \\( p = 41 \\), \\( p^2 = 1681 \\)\n- \\( p = 43 \\), \\( p^2 = 1849 \\)\n- \\( p = 47 \\), \\( p^2 = 2209 \\) (This exceeds 2010, so stop here)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe prime numbers \\( p \\) such that \\( p^2 \\leq 2010 \\) are:\n\n\\[\np = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43\n\\]\n\nThat's a total of 14 primes.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIs this list complete? Yes, I've listed all primes whose squares are less than or equal to 2010.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Verifying Each \\( i = p^2 \\) Satisfies the Equation**\n\n**Approach:**  \nFor each prime \\( p \\), compute \\( f(p^2) \\) and check if it equals \\( 1 + p + p^2 \\).\n\n**Case 1:** \\( p = 2 \\)  \n\\[\ni = 4\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(4) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 2 + 4 = 7\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(4) = 7 = 7\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHolds.\n\n**Case 2:** \\( p = 3 \\)  \n\\[\ni = 9\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(9) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(9) = 13 = 13\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHolds.\n\n**Case 3:** \\( p = 5 \\)  \n\\[\ni = 25\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(25) = 1 + 5 + 25 = 31\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 5 + 25 = 31\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(25) = 31 = 31\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHolds.\n\n**Case 4:** \\( p = 7 \\)  \n\\[\ni = 49\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(49) = 1 + 7 + 49 = 57\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 7 + 49 = 57\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(49) = 57 = 57\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHolds.\n\n**Case 5:** \\( p = 11 \\)  \n\\[\ni = 121\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(121) = 1 + 11 + 121 = 133\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 11 + 121 = 133\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(121) = 133 = 133\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHolds.\n\n**Case 6:** \\( p = 13 \\)  \n\\[\ni = 169\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(169) = 1 + 13 + 169 = 183\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 13 + 169 = 183\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(169) = 183 = 183\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHolds.\n\n**Case 7:** \\( p = 17 \\)  \n\\[\ni = 289\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(289) = 1 + 17 + 289 = 307\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 17 + 289 = 307\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(289) = 307 = 307\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHolds.\n\n**Case 8:** \\( p = 19 \\)  \n\\[\ni = 361\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(361) = 1 + 19 + 361 = 381\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 19 + 361 = 381\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(361) = 381 = 381\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHolds.\n\n**Case 9:** \\( p = 23 \\)  \n\\[\ni = 529\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(529) = 1 + 23 + 529 = 553\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 23 + 529 = 553\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(529) = 553 = 553\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHolds.\n\n**Case 10:** \\( p = 29 \\)  \n\\[\ni = 841\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(841) = 1 + 29 + 841 = 871\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 29 + 841 = 871\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(841) = 871 = 871\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHolds.\n\n**Case 11:** \\( p = 31 \\)  \n\\[\ni = 961\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(961) = 1 + 31 + 961 = 993\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 31 + 961 = 993\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(961) = 993 = 993\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHolds.\n\n**Case 12:** \\( p = 37 \\)  \n\\[\ni = 1369\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(1369) = 1 + 37 + 1369 = 1407\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 37 + 1369 = 1407\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(1369) = 1407 = 1407\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHolds.\n\n**Case 13:** \\( p = 41 \\)  \n\\[\ni = 1681\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(1681) = 1 + 41 + 1681 = 1723\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 41 + 1681 = 1723\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(1681) = 1723 = 1723\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHolds.\n\n**Case 14:** \\( p = 43 \\)  \n\\[\ni = 1849\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(1849) = 1 + 43 + 1849 = 1893\n\\]  \n\\[\n1 + 43 + 1849 = 1893\n\\]  \n\\[\nf(1849) = 1893 = 1893\n\\]  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nHolds.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nAll cases satisfy the equation, confirming that \\( i = p^2 \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime number up to 43.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis validation step confirms our earlier hypothesis that \\( i \\) must be the square of a prime.

Additionally, the sum of divisors function \\( f(i) \\) is always an integer, so the right side must also be an integer. Thus, only perfect squares of primes satisfy the equation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe approach is correct, and the final answer is valid.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThere are **14** integers \\( i \\) such that \\( 1 \\leq i \\leq 2010 \\) and \\( f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i \\).",
  "ground_truth": "Note firstly that $f(i)$ must be an integer, so this means that $i$ must be a perfect square in order for $\\sqrt{i}$ to be an integer. Out of the perfect squares, we claim that $i$ must be the square of some prime $p$. For if $\\sqrt{i}$ is composite, then it can be written as the product of two integers $a$ and $b$ and we find $f(i) \\ge 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i + a + b > 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$. Moreover, if $\\sqrt{i}$ is prime, then the only factors of $i$ are 1, $\\sqrt{i}$, and $i$, so $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$ as desired. It follows that we only need to calculate the number of primes less than $\\sqrt{2010}$. Since $\\sqrt{2010} < 45$, the desired set of primes is $\\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43\\}$. The set has $\\boxed{14}$ elements."
