  "problem": "Let $f(x) = (x+2)^2-5$. If the domain of $f$ is all real numbers, then $f$ does not have an inverse function, but if we restrict the domain of $f$ to an interval $[c,\\infty)$, then $f$ may have an inverse function. What is the smallest value of $c$ we can use here, so that $f$ does have an inverse function?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's put this solution together in a coherent manner, making sure it flows naturally while maintaining the original thought process. I'll keep the final answer unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have the function \\( f(x) = (x+2)^2 - 5 \\) with a domain of all real numbers. The goal is to determine the smallest value of \\( c \\) such that by restricting the domain to \\( [c, \\infty) \\), the function \\( f \\) becomes invertible.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Invertibility Requirement:** I know that for a function to have an inverse, it must be **one-to-one** (injective). This means each \\( y \\)-value should correspond to exactly one \\( x \\)-value.\n\n- **Quadratic Functions:** Since \\( f(x) \\) is a quadratic function, which typically has a parabolic shape, it's not one-to-one over its entire domain. Hence, restricting the domain is necessary.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\nThis reminds me of making functions monotonic (either entirely increasing or decreasing) to ensure invertibility. But I'm not entirely sure how to find the exact \\( c \\) right away, so I'll explore different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Graphical Approach:** Visualize the function to identify where it becomes one-to-one.\n   \n2. **Algebraic Analysis:** Use derivatives to determine intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing.\n\n3. **Symmetry Considerations:** Since it's a quadratic, perhaps the vertex plays a crucial role.\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n\nStarting with the **graphical approach** seems intuitive. If that doesn't yield clarity, I'll proceed with algebraic methods to confirm my findings.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Graphical Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s visualize the graph of \\( f(x) = (x+2)^2 - 5 \\). I recognize this as a **parabola** opening upwards because the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive.\n\n**Sketching the Graph:**\n\n- **Vertex:** The parabola is in vertex form \\( (x+2)^2 - 5 \\), so the vertex is at \\( (-2, -5) \\).\n  \n- **Axis of Symmetry:** The line \\( x = -2 \\).\n\n- **Behavior:** The function decreases to the left of \\( x = -2 \\) and increases to the right.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nTo make the function one-to-one, I need to focus on the interval where it's **monotonic increasing**\u2014that is, from the vertex onwards.\n\n**Checking:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, restricting the domain to where the function increases ensures each \\( y \\)-value is unique.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Interval**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince the function is increasing from \\( x = -2 \\) onwards, setting \\( c = -2 \\) should make the function invertible.\n\n**Writing it Out:**\n\nBy restricting the domain to \\( [c, \\infty) = [-2, \\infty) \\), the function becomes **monotonic increasing**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIs \\( c = -2 \\) the smallest value? Yes, because starting at the vertex ensures the function is one-to-one from that point forward.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nIf \\( c > -2 \\), I\u2019d unnecessarily exclude part of the increasing interval. Therefore, \\( c = -2 \\) is optimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Algebraic Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo confirm, I'll use calculus to verify that the function is increasing for \\( x \\geq -2 \\).\n\n**Calculating the Derivative:**\n\n\\[\nf(x) = (x+2)^2 - 5\n\\]\n\\[\nf'(x) = 2(x+2)\n\\]\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **For \\( x \\geq -2 \\):** \\( f'(x) = 2(x+2) \\geq 0 \\)  \n  - At \\( x = -2 \\), \\( f'(x) = 0 \\) (the vertex point).\n  - For \\( x > -2 \\), \\( f'(x) > 0 \\), indicating the function is increasing.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis confirms that starting from \\( x = -2 \\), the function is monotonic increasing, making it one-to-one.\n\n**Checking:**\n\nDoes this align with the graphical intuition? Yes, both approaches agree.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Ensuring Invertibility**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I'll ensure that with \\( c = -2 \\), the function is indeed one-to-one.\n\n**Checking One-to-One Condition:**\n\nFor \\( x_1, x_2 \\geq -2 \\), suppose \\( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\). Then:\n\n\\[\n(x_1 + 2)^2 - 5 = (x_2 + 2)^2 - 5 \n\\]\n\\[\n(x_1 + 2)^2 = (x_2 + 2)^2 \n\\]\n\\[\nx_1 + 2 = \\pm (x_2 + 2) \n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n- **Positive Case:** \\( x_1 = x_2 \\)\n- **Negative Case:** \\( x_1 = -4 - x_2 \\)\n\n**But Wait:**\n\nThe negative case only applies if \\( x_1 \\) or \\( x_2 \\) is less than \\( -2 \\), which is outside our restricted domain \\( [-2, \\infty) \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWithin the domain \\( [-2, \\infty) \\), the function is one-to-one.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis algebraic check reinforces that \\( c = -2 \\) is correct.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nEverything aligns\u2014both graphical and algebraic methods confirm invertibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Is \\( c = -2 \\) the Smallest Value?**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIs there any possibility of choosing a \\( c \\) smaller than \\( -2 \\)?\n\n**Exploring Alternative Strategies:**\n\n- If \\( c < -2 \\), the domain would include a decreasing interval, violating the one-to-one condition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, \\( c = -2 \\) is indeed the **smallest** value that makes \\( f \\) invertible.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nAll strategies point to \\( c = -2 \\) as the optimal choice. There's no need to restrict the domain further.\n\n**Quick Recap:**\n\n- **Graphical Approach:** Showed that the function is increasing from \\( x = -2 \\).\n  \n- **Algebraic Verification:** Derivative confirmed monotonicity starting at \\( x = -2 \\).\n  \n- **One-to-One Check:** Ensured no duplicity in \\( y \\)-values within the restricted domain.\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER> solution\n\nThe smallest value of \\( c \\) that makes \\( f(x) = (x+2)^2 - 5 \\) have an inverse function is **\\( c = -2 \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy approaching the problem from multiple angles\u2014graphical intuition, algebraic verification, and ensuring the one-to-one condition\u2014I confidently arrived at \\( c = -2 \\) as the smallest value needed to make \\( f \\) invertible. Reflecting at each step ensured correctness and allowed me to catch any potential errors early on.\n\n---\n\nI hope this structured approach provides a clear and comprehensive solution to the problem!",

If we restrict the domain of $f$ to $[-2,\\infty)$, then $f$ has no repeated values, as $f$ is increasing throughout its domain. But if we restrict the domain to $[c,\\infty)$ where $c<-2$, then $f$ has repeated values. So, the smallest $c$ which will work is $c=\\boxed{-2}$."
