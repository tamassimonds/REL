    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem as thoughtfully as possible, reflecting on our approach at each step, checking for correctness, and adjusting our strategies as needed. Here's how I would approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the equation given is \\(3(2x - a) = 2(3x + 12)\\). We're asked to find the value of \\(a\\) that makes this equation have infinitely many solutions for \\(x\\). \n\n*Infinitely many solutions* usually implies that the equation is an identity, meaning both sides are equivalent for all values of \\(x\\). So, my goal is to determine \\(a\\) such that the equation holds true for any \\(x\\).\n\n**Brainstorming Approaches:**\n\n1. **Expand Both Sides:** Simplify both sides of the equation to see if they can be made identical.\n2. **Set Coefficients Equal:** Since the equation must hold for all \\(x\\), the coefficients of \\(x\\) on both sides must be equal, as well as the constant terms.\n3. **Alternative Methods:** Consider factoring or using properties of equality, but those seem less straightforward here.\n\nI think expanding both sides and then comparing coefficients is the most direct approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expanding Both Sides**\n\n**Let's Try Expanding:**\n\nStarting with the left side:\n\n\\[ \n3(2x - a) = 3 \\cdot 2x - 3 \\cdot a = 6x - 3a \n\\]\n\nNow, the right side:\n\n\\[ \n2(3x + 12) = 2 \\cdot 3x + 2 \\cdot 12 = 6x + 24 \n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ \n6x - 3a = 6x + 24 \n\\]\n\n**Reflecting:**\n\nHmm, this looks promising. If both sides need to be equal for all \\(x\\), the coefficients of \\(x\\) on both sides already match (\\(6x\\) on both sides). That leaves us with the constants.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing the Constants**\n\n**Set the Constant Terms Equal:**\n\nSince the coefficients of \\(x\\) are already equal, the constant terms must also be equal for the equation to hold for all \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ \n-3a = 24 \n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(a\\):**\n\nDivide both sides by \\(-3\\):\n\n\\[ \na = \\frac{24}{-3} = -8 \n\\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\nWait, does this make sense? Let me plug \\(a = -8\\) back into the original equation to verify.\n\nOriginal equation with \\(a = -8\\):\n\n\\[ \n3(2x - (-8)) = 2(3x + 12) \n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ \n3(2x + 8) = 2(3x + 12) \n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: \n\\[ \n6x + 24 \n\\]\n\nRight side: \n\\[ \n6x + 24 \n\\]\n\nBoth sides are indeed equal, confirming that \\(a = -8\\) makes the equation an identity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Reflection and Validation**\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nInitially, I considered setting the coefficients equal, which led directly to solving for \\(a\\). This approach was straightforward and efficient. However, to ensure correctness, I verified by substituting \\(a = -8\\) back into the original equation, which confirmed that both sides are identical.\n\n**Check for Mistakes:**\n\nNo mistakes were made in the process. The expansion and solving steps were straightforward, and the verification step confirmed the solution.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThe strategy of expanding both sides and comparing coefficients worked well here. It provided a clear path to finding the value of \\(a\\) that makes the equation hold for all \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>**\n\nThe value of \\(a\\) that makes the equation \\(3(2x - a) = 2(3x + 12)\\) have infinitely many solutions is **\\(a = -8\\)**.\n\n</ANSWER>",

  "ground_truth": "Distributing on both sides gives $6x-3a = 6x+24$.  Subtracting $6x$ from both sides gives $-3a=24$.  If $a=\\boxed{-8}$, then this equation is always true, and the original equation is true for all $x$ (and so has infinitely many solutions).  Otherwise, the equation is never true, so the original equation has no solutions."
