    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it by hand, reflecting and checking at each stage to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts: Okay, we have a right hexagonal pyramid with two cross sections obtained by planes parallel to the base. The areas of these cross sections are given as \\(216\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(486\\sqrt{3}\\) square feet, and the planes are 8 feet apart. We need to find how far the larger cross section is from the apex.\n\nThis reminds me of similar problems involving pyramids and cross sections, where the areas relate to distances from the apex. I think the concept of similar figures and the properties of pyramids might be useful here.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Strategy 1:** Use the properties of similar shapes since the cross sections are parallel to the base.\n- **Strategy 2:** Apply the Pythagorean theorem if needed, considering the right pyramid\u2019s geometry.\n- **Strategy 3:** Set up a ratio involving areas and corresponding distances from the apex.\n\nLet\u2019s explore Strategy 1 first since similar figures often simplify problems involving varying areas and heights.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Strategy 1 - Similar Figures**\n\nIf the cross sections are parallel to the base, then each cross section is a hexagon similar to the base hexagon. In a pyramid, cross sections parallel to the base form shapes similar to the base, and their areas are proportional to the square of their corresponding linear dimensions.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The areas of the cross sections are proportional to the square of their distances from the apex.\n- If we let \\( d_2 \\) be the distance from the apex to the larger cross section, and \\( d_1 \\) to the smaller one, then:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\left(\\frac{d_1}{d_2}\\right)^2\n  \\]\n  Where \\( A_1 = 216\\sqrt{3} \\) and \\( A_2 = 486\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nWait, that can't be right because we don't know d1 or d2 yet. Maybe it's better to express one distance in terms of the other, considering the 8 feet apart constraint.\n\n**Adjusting the Approach:**\n- Let\u2019s denote:\n  - \\( d_2 \\) as the distance from the apex to the larger area (which we need to find),\n  - \\( d_1 = d_2 - 8 \\) since the two planes are 8 feet apart.\n\nNow, substituting into the area ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{216\\sqrt{3}}{486\\sqrt{3}} = \\left(\\frac{d_1}{d_2}\\right)^2\n\\]\nSimplifying the area ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{216}{486} = \\left(\\frac{d_1}{d_2}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{9} = \\left(\\frac{d_1}{d_2}\\right)^2\n\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{d_1}{d_2}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( d_1 = \\frac{2}{3}d_2 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis makes sense because the smaller area should have a smaller corresponding distance ratio.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\( d_2 \\)**\n\nWe know that \\( d_1 = d_2 - 8 \\) and from the ratio, \\( d_1 = \\frac{2}{3}d_2 \\). Setting these equal:\n\n\\[\nd_2 - 8 = \\frac{2}{3}d_2\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- We have an equation with one variable (\\( d_2 \\)). Solving for \\( d_2 \\) should give us the distance from the apex to the larger cross section.\n\n**Solving the Equation:**\n\\[\nd_2 - \\frac{2}{3}d_2 = 8\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}d_2 = 8\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by 3:\n\\[\nd_2 = 24\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- If \\( d_2 = 24 \\), then \\( d_1 = 24 - 8 = 16 \\).\n- The ratio \\( \\frac{d_1}{d_2} = \\frac{16}{24} = \\frac{2}{3} \\), which matches our earlier ratio.\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Verification:**\n- The area ratio was \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\), and the square root of that is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), which corresponds to the linear distance ratio.\n- Distances calculated satisfy the given separation of 8 feet.\n\n**Alternative Strategy Check:**\n- Strategy 2 involved using the Pythagorean theorem, but since Strategy 1 led directly to a correct answer, there's no need to complicate further.\n- Strategy 3 aligns with Strategy 1, reinforcing the correctness.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nThe approach using similar figures and area ratios effectively solved the problem. The calculations are consistent, and intermediate checks confirm the solution\u2019s validity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER> \n\nThe larger cross section is **24 feet** from the apex of the pyramid.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step walkthrough helps! Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore.",

  "ground_truth": "The ratio of the areas of the cross sections is equal to $\\frac{216\\sqrt{3}}{486\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac 49$. Since the ratio of the area of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides, it follows that the ratio of the corresponding sides of the cross-sections is equal to $\\sqrt{\\frac 49} = \\frac 23$.\n\nNow consider the right triangles formed by the apex of the pyramid, the foot of the altitude from the apex to the cross section, and a vertex of the hexagon. It follows that these two right triangles will be similar, since they share an angle at the apex. The ratio of their legs in the cross-section is $2/3$, so it follows that the heights of the right triangles are in the same ratio. Suppose that the larger cross section is $h$ feet away from the apex; then $h - \\frac{2}{3} h = 8$, so $\\frac h3 = 8 \\Longrightarrow h = \\boxed{24}$ feet."
