  "problem": "What is the sum of the squares of the coefficients of $4(x^4 + 3x^2 + 1)$?",
  "solution": "## First Thoughts\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. The problem asks for the sum of the squares of the coefficients of \\(4(x^4 + 3x^2 + 1)\\). My initial reaction is that it involves expanding the expression to find the coefficients and then squaring them. This reminds me of problems involving polynomials where we need to analyze the coefficients, but honestly, I haven't tackled something like this in a while, so I might need to brainstorm different strategies.\n\n## Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Expand the Expression:**  \n   - Maybe I should expand \\(4(x^4 + 3x^2 + 1)\\) first to identify the coefficients.\n  \n2. **Identify Coefficients Directly:**  \n   - Perhaps I can see the coefficients without fully expanding by factoring out the 4.\n\n3. **Using Binomial Theorem:**  \n   - Wait, no, this doesn't seem applicable since it's not a binomial expansion.\n\n<REFLECTION>Hmm, I think the first strategy\u2014expanding the expression\u2014makes the most sense to start with. Let's give it a try.</REFLECTION>\n\n## Step 1: Expanding the Expression\n\n### Thought Process\nI need to distribute the 4 across each term inside the parentheses to find the coefficients.\n\n### Calculation\n\\[\n4(x^4 + 3x^2 + 1) = 4 \\times x^4 + 4 \\times 3x^2 + 4 \\times 1\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\\[\n= 4x^4 + 12x^2 + 4\n\\]\n\n<REFLECTION>Okay, that was straightforward. Now I have the expanded polynomial: \\(4x^4 + 12x^2 + 4\\). The coefficients are 4, 12, and 4. But wait, there's no \\(x^3\\) or \\(x\\) term, so their coefficients are implicitly zero. Initially, I missed those, so I need to account for them.</REFLECTION>\n\n## Step 2: Identifying All Coefficients\n\n### Thought Process\nTo avoid missing any coefficients, I should explicitly list all coefficients, including those with zero values.\n\n### Listing Coefficients\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Coefficient of } x^4 &: 4 \\\\\n\\text{Coefficient of } x^3 &: 0 \\\\\n\\text{Coefficient of } x^2 &: 12 \\\\\n\\text{Coefficient of } x^1 &: 0 \\\\\n\\text{Coefficient of } x^0 &: 4 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n<REFLECTION>This looks better. Now I have all the coefficients, including zeros for the missing terms. It's important to account for all degrees of the polynomial to ensure accuracy.</REFLECTION>\n\n## Step 3: Calculating Sum of Squares of Coefficients\n\n### Thought Process\nNow, I need to square each coefficient and then sum them up. This step should give me the desired result.\n\n### Calculation\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Sum of squares} &= 4^2 + 0^2 + 12^2 + 0^2 + 4^2 \\\\\n&= 16 + 0 + 144 + 0 + 16 \\\\\n&= 176 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n<REFLECTION>Adding them up gives me 176. This seems reasonable. Quick mental check: 16 + 144 is 160, and adding another 16 gives 176. No discrepancies found, so the calculation appears correct.</REFLECTION>\n\n## Step 4: Verifying the Approach\n\n### Thought Process\nBefore finalizing the answer, I should verify if the approach is correct. Did I consider all necessary coefficients? Is squaring them the right operation?\n\n- **Did I include all coefficients?** Yes, including the zeros.\n- **Is squaring each coefficient correct?** Yes, the problem explicitly asks for the sum of the squares.\n- **Any alternative methods to verify?** Not immediately seeing another straightforward method, but the current approach seems solid.\n\n<REFLECTION>Everything checks out. The process of expanding, identifying coefficients, and summing their squares is logical and aligns with the problem's requirements.</REFLECTION>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully expanding the expression, identifying all coefficients (including zeros), and calculating the sum of their squares, the final answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{176}\\)\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThis problem was straightforward once I recognized the need to expand the polynomial and account for all coefficients, including those that are zero. It was helpful to brainstorm different strategies initially and then reflect at each step to ensure correctness. Overall, taking a methodical approach and verifying each step led to a confident solution.",
  "ground_truth": "We simply distribute the $4$ to get $4x^4 + 12x^2 + 4.$ Then, the sum of the squares of the coefficients is $4^2 + 12^2 + 4^2 = \\boxed{176}.$\n\nNote that the constant term $4$ is indeed a coefficient: it is the coefficient of $x^0$."
