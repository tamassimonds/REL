  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, reflecting and checking my work as I go along.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the problem asks for the non-zero value of \\( c \\) such that there is exactly one positive value of \\( b \\) for which the quadratic equation \n\n\\[\nx^2 + \\left( b + \\frac{1}{b} \\right) x + c = 0\n\\]\n\nhas exactly one solution.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a quadratic equation problem where I need to ensure the equation has exactly one solution (a double root). It reminds me of using the discriminant, but the presence of \\( b \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{b} \\) complicates things a bit.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** I think I need to relate \\( c \\) and \\( b \\) in such a way that the equation has a double root for a specific \\( b \\). Maybe using the discriminant condition \\(\\Delta = 0\\) could help. I'll explore that first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\nI'll start by listing potential strategies:\n\n1. **Use the Discriminant (\\(\\Delta = 0\\)):** For a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero.\n\n2. **Vertex of the Parabola:** Ensure that the vertex lies on the x-axis.\n\n3. **Completing the Square:** Rewrite the equation to identify conditions for a perfect square.\n\n- **Reflection:** The discriminant approach seems the most straightforward for ensuring a double root. I'll start there, but I'm open to switching if it doesn't lead anywhere.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Discriminant Strategy**\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with the discriminant.\n\nFor \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\). The equation has exactly one solution when \\(\\Delta = 0\\).\n\n- **Writing It Out:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\Delta = \\left( b + \\frac{1}{b} \\right)^2 - 4c = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **Expanding:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\left( b + \\frac{1}{b} \\right)^2 = b^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{b^2}\n  \\]\n\n  So,\n\n  \\[\n  b^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} - 4c = 0\n  \\]\n\n  Simplifying,\n\n  \\[\n  b^2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} + 2 = 4c\n  \\]\n\n  Thus,\n\n  \\[\n  4c = b^2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} + 2\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This equation relates \\( c \\) and \\( b \\). I need to find \\( c \\) such that there's exactly one positive \\( b \\) satisfying this equation. It seems like I need to find \\( b \\) in terms of \\( c \\) or vice versa.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\( b^2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} \\)**\n\nLooking at the equation, I notice that \\( b^2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( b + \\frac{1}{b} \\):\n\n- **Thinking Out Loud:** I remember that if I set \\( t = b + \\frac{1}{b} \\), then \\( t^2 = b^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} \\). This seems useful.\n\n- **Calculations:**\n\n  \\[\n  t = b + \\frac{1}{b} \\implies t^2 = b^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} \\implies b^2 + \\frac{1}{b^2} = t^2 - 2\n  \\]\n\n- **Substituting Back:**\n\n  \\[\n  4c = (t^2 - 2) + 2 = t^2\n  \\]\n\n  So,\n\n  \\[\n  4c = t^2 \\implies t = \\pm \\sqrt{4c}\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This simplifies things significantly. Now, \\( b + \\frac{1}{b} = \\pm \\sqrt{4c} \\). I need to find \\( c \\) such that there's exactly one positive \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Analyzing \\( b + \\frac{1}{b} = \\pm \\sqrt{4c} \\)**\n\nLet's consider both cases:\n\n1. \\( b + \\frac{1}{b} = \\sqrt{4c} \\)\n\n2. \\( b + \\frac{1}{b} = -\\sqrt{4c} \\)\n\n- **Focusing on Positive \\( b \\):** Since we're looking for positive \\( b \\), the first equation is more relevant. However, I'll keep both in mind in case negative \\( b \\) plays a role.\n\n- **Solving for \\( b \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  b + \\frac{1}{b} = \\sqrt{4c}\n  \\]\n\n  Let\u2019s multiply both sides by \\( b \\) to get:\n\n  \\[\n  b^2 + 1 = b \\cdot \\sqrt{4c}\n  \\]\n\n  Rearranging:\n\n  \\[\n  b^2 - b \\cdot \\sqrt{4c} + 1 = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This is a quadratic in terms of \\( b \\). I can use the quadratic formula to solve for \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the Quadratic for \\( b \\)**\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\n\\] \n\nwhere \\( A = 1 \\), \\( B = -\\sqrt{4c} \\), and \\( C = 1 \\):\n\n- **Writing It Out:**\n\n  \\[\n  b = \\frac{\\sqrt{4c} \\pm \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{4c})^2 - 4}}{2}\n  \\]\n\n  Simplifying:\n\n  \\[\n  b = \\frac{\\sqrt{4c} \\pm \\sqrt{4c - 4}}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** For \\( b \\) to be real, the discriminant \\( 4c - 4 \\) must be non-negative, i.e., \\( c \\geq 1 \\). This is an important constraint.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Ensuring Exactly One Positive \\( b \\)**\n\nWe need \\( c \\) such that there is exactly one positive \\( b \\). Let's analyze the solutions:\n\n- **Thinking Out Loud:** Normally, a quadratic equation yields two solutions. To have exactly one positive \\( b \\), either both solutions are the same (a double root) or one is positive and the other is negative but irrelevant.\n\n- **Case Analysis:**\n\n  1. **Double Root:** This occurs when the discriminant is zero.\n\n     \\[\n     4c - 4 = 0 \\implies c = 1\n     \\]\n\n     - **Check:** If \\( c = 1 \\),\n\n       \\[\n       b = \\frac{\\sqrt{4 \\times 1} \\pm \\sqrt{4 \\times 1 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm 0}{2} = 1\n       \\]\n\n       - **Outcome:** There is exactly one positive \\( b = 1 \\).\n\n  2. **Distinct Roots:** If \\( c > 1 \\), the discriminant \\( 4c - 4 > 0 \\), leading to two distinct \\( b \\) values.\n\n     - **Check:** For \\( c > 1 \\), both roots are real, and since the quadratic opens upwards (A = 1), both roots could be positive or one positive and one negative. This doesn't satisfy the condition of exactly one positive \\( b \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** Only \\( c = 1 \\) ensures exactly one positive \\( b \\) by making the quadratic have a double root at \\( b = 1 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying the Solution**\n\nLet\u2019s verify if \\( c = 1 \\) satisfies the original equation\u2019s condition:\n\n- **Substituting \\( c = 1 \\):**\n\n  The equation becomes:\n\n  \\[\n  x^2 + \\left( b + \\frac{1}{b} \\right) x + 1 = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **For \\( b = 1 \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  x^2 + (1 + 1)x + 1 = 0 \\implies x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  (x + 1)^2 = 0 \\implies x = -1\n  \\]\n\n- **Outcome:** There is exactly one solution \\( x = -1 \\), which aligns with the condition of having exactly one solution.\n\n- **Reflection:** This confirms that \\( c = 1 \\) is indeed the correct value.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check:**\n\n- **Is There Exactly One Positive \\( b \\)?** Yes, \\( b = 1 \\) is the only positive value that satisfies the condition when \\( c = 1 \\).\n\n- **Does the Quadratic Have Exactly One Solution?** Yes, the discriminant is zero, leading to a double root.\n\n- **Conclusion:** All conditions are satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\nc = 1\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy systematically applying the discriminant condition and analyzing the resulting equations, I determined that \\( c = 1 \\) is the only non-zero value that ensures exactly one positive \\( b \\) for which the quadratic equation has exactly one solution. Throughout the process, I continuously reflected on and verified each step to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Reflection:**\n\n- **What if \\( c \\neq 1 \\)?** If \\( c > 1 \\), the discriminant of the quadratic in \\( b \\) becomes positive, leading to two distinct \\( b \\) values, potentially yielding more than one positive \\( b \\). If \\( c < 1 \\), the discriminant becomes negative, resulting in no real \\( b \\). Therefore, \\( c = 1 \\) is the only viable solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Recap:**\n\n1. **Started with the discriminant condition \\(\\Delta = 0\\).**\n\n2. **Simplified the equation to relate \\( c \\) and \\( b \\).**\n\n3. **Solved for \\( b \\) using the quadratic formula.**\n\n4. **Analyzed conditions to ensure exactly one positive \\( b \\).**\n\n5. **Verified the solution by substituting back into the original equation.**\n\n6. **Concluded \\( c = 1 \\) as the correct answer.**\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with continuous reflection and verification, ensures a robust solution to the problem.",
  "ground_truth": "The discriminant of the given quadratic equation is $\\left(b+\\frac 1b\\right)^2 - 4c$. For the quadratic to have one root, it follows that the discriminant must be equal to zero, so $b^2 + 2 - 4c + \\frac 1{b^2} = 0$. We are also given that there should be exactly one positive value $b$ satisfying this equation. Multiplying through by $b^2$ (for we know that $b \\neq 0$) yields that $b^4 + (2-4c)b^2 + 1 = 0$; this is a quadratic equation in $b^2$ that has discriminant $(2-4c)^2 - 4$. Again, this discriminant must be equal to zero, so $(2-4c)^2 = 4 \\Longrightarrow 2-4c = \\pm 2$. The non-zero value of $c$ satisfying this equation is $c = \\boxed{1}$."
