  "solution": "Sure, let's put this all together into a polished, coherent solution while ensuring the thought process remains clear and logical. I'll maintain the original strategies and reflections but streamline them for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\n11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0\n\\]\n\nby completing the square to arrive at:\n\n\\[\n(x + r)^2 = s\n\\]\n\nand then find the sum \\(r + s\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo make completing the square easier, let's divide the entire equation by the leading coefficient (11).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11x^2 - 44x - 99}{11} = 0 \\implies x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSimplifying the equation makes the coefficients more manageable, setting us up nicely for the next steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Move the Constant Term**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIsolate the quadratic and linear terms by moving the constant to the other side.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x = 9\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow, the equation is ready for completing the square.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Complete the Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo complete the square, add \\(\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2\\) to both sides, where \\(b\\) is the coefficient of \\(x\\). Here, \\(b = -4\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{-4}{2}\\right)^2 = 2^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nAdd 4 to both sides:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = 9 + 4 \\implies (x - 2)^2 = 13\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDouble-checking: \\((x - 2)^2\\) expands back to \\(x^2 - 4x + 4\\), so this step is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Identify \\(r\\) and \\(s\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nCompare the equation \\((x - 2)^2 = 13\\) to the desired form \\((x + r)^2 = s\\).\n\n**Identification:**\n\n\\[\nr = -2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s = 13\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLooks good! Substituting back confirms that \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) are correctly identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate \\(r + s\\)**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nr + s = -2 + 13 = 11\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe sum \\(r + s\\) is 11. To ensure accuracy, let's verify this result using an alternative method.\n\n---\n\n### **Verification: Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIt's always a good idea to cross-check using a different method. Let's apply the quadratic formula to see if the roots match our completed square approach.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFor the original equation:\n\n\\[\n11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing \\(a = 11\\), \\(b = -44\\), \\(c = -99\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-44) \\pm \\sqrt{(-44)^2 - 4 \\times 11 \\times (-99)}}{2 \\times 11}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{44 \\pm \\sqrt{1936 + 4356}}{22}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{44 \\pm \\sqrt{6292}}{22} = \\frac{44 \\pm \\sqrt{4 \\times 1573}}{22} = \\frac{44 \\pm 2\\sqrt{1573}}{22} = \\frac{22 \\pm \\sqrt{1573}}{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 2 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{1573}}{11}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThese roots align with our completed square solution \\((x - 2)^2 = 13\\), confirming that our original approach is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(\\boxed{11}\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Recap**\n\nBy systematically completing the square, simplifying the equation, and verifying the result using the quadratic formula, we confidently arrived at \\(r + s = 11\\). This thorough approach ensures accuracy and reinforces the correctness of the solution.\n\nThroughout, I maintained a logical flow, checking each step for correctness and adjusting strategies as needed to emulate a genuine human thought process.",
  "ground_truth": "Dividing both sides of the equation $11x^2-44x-99$ by $11$, we have $$x^2-4x-9 = 0.$$The square which agrees with $x^2-4x-9$ except for the constant term is $(x-2)^2$, which is equal to $x^2-4x+4$ and thus to $(x^2-4x-9)+13$.\n\nTherefore, by adding $13$ to each side, Krzysztof rewrote the equation $x^2-4x-9 = 0$ as $$(x-2)^2 = 13$$We have $r=-2$, $s=13$, and thus $r+s=\\boxed{11}$."
