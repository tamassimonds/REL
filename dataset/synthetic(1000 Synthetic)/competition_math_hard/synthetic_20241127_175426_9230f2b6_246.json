  "solution": "Certainly! Let's navigate through this problem step-by-step, reflecting on different strategies, adjusting our approach as needed, and ensuring a clear, coherent solution. I'll maintain authenticity by showing my thought process, including any initial mistakes and corrections, just as a human solver would.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nHmm, okay, let's see... \n\n> **Problem Statement:**  \n> Find two two-digit positive integers whose average equals a decimal number formed by placing one integer before the decimal point and the other after.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:**  \n  This seems like a blend of averages and decimals. The average of two numbers is connected to a specific decimal representation involving these numbers.\n\n- **First Thoughts:**  \n  Maybe I can relate the average to how the decimal number is formed. It feels like I need to express both the average and the decimal in terms of the integers.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Express the Average Mathematically:** Write an equation for the average.\n  2. **Represent the Decimal Number:** Formulate how the decimal number is constructed from the integers.\n  3. **Set Up an Equation:** Equate the average to the decimal and solve.\n\nLet's start by exploring these ideas.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Express the Average Mathematically**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  The average of two numbers is straightforward. I can write it as \\((x + y) / 2\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the two-digit integers.\n\n- **Writing It Out:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Average} = \\frac{x + y}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Okay, that part is simple. Now, I need to connect this to the decimal number mentioned in the problem.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Represent the Decimal Number**\n\n- **Initial Idea:**  \n  The decimal number is formed by placing one integer before the decimal point and the other after. So, it looks like \\(x.y\\).\n\n- **Wait a Minute:**  \n  But decimals represent fractional parts. How can I express this decimal in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)?\n\n- **Thinking Through:**  \n  I can write \\(x.y\\) as \\(x + \\frac{y}{100}\\) because \\(y\\) is in the hundredths place.\n\n- **Writing It Out:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Decimal Number} = x + \\frac{y}{100}\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:**  \n  Does this make sense? Yeah, if \\(y\\) is 12, for example, \\(x.y\\) would be \\(x + 0.12\\).\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Set Up the Equation**\n\n- **Combining Both Ideas:**  \n  The average equals the decimal number. So, I can set the two expressions equal.\n\n- **Equation:**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{x + y}{2} = x + \\frac{y}{100}\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This looks promising. I have one equation with two variables. Maybe I can simplify it to find a relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Simplifying the Equation**\n\n#### **Step 1: Eliminate Fractions**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Fractions can be tricky. Let's multiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the denominator.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  100 \\times \\frac{x + y}{2} = 100 \\times \\left( x + \\frac{y}{100} \\right)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  50(x + y) = 100x + y\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  That's better. Now, I have an equation without fractions. Let's simplify it further.\n\n#### **Step 2: Expand and Rearrange**\n\n- **Expanding:**  \n  \\[\n  50x + 50y = 100x + y\n  \\]\n\n- **Rearranging:**  \n  Let's bring all terms to one side.\n\n  \\[\n  50x + 50y - 100x - y = 0\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -50x + 49y = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplifying:**  \n  Divide both sides by -1 to make it neater.\n\n  \\[\n  50x = 49y\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:**  \n  Does this make sense? Yes, it shows a direct relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Interpreting the Relationship**\n\n#### **Equation: \\(50x = 49y\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  This equation ties \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) together. Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are two-digit integers, I can solve for one in terms of the other.\n\n- **Solving for \\(y\\):**  \n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{50}{49}x\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Hmm, \\(\\frac{50}{49}\\) is approximately 1.02. So, \\(y\\) is slightly larger than \\(x\\). This makes sense because multiplying \\(x\\) by a bit more than 1 scales it up slightly.\n\n#### **Finding Integer Solutions**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) must be two-digit integers, I need to find values of \\(x\\) that make \\(y\\) an integer.\n\n- **Wait, Let Me Check:**  \n  Does \\(\\frac{50}{49}\\) result in an integer for certain \\(x\\) values? Let's see.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{50}{49}x \\implies 50x = 49y\n  \\]\n  This means \\(50x\\) must be divisible by 49 for \\(y\\) to be an integer.\n\n- **Thought:**  \n  Maybe I can find the smallest \\(x\\) that satisfies this.\n\n---\n\n### **Testing for Two-Digit Integers**\n\n#### **Finding the Smallest \\(x\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Let's find the smallest two-digit \\(x\\) that makes \\(y\\) a two-digit integer.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  50x = 49y \\implies y = \\frac{50}{49}x\n  \\]\n  I need \\(y\\) to be an integer, so \\(50x\\) must be divisible by 49.\n\n- **Wait, Let Me Check:**  \n  What's the smallest \\(x\\) that satisfies this within two-digit limits (10 \u2264 \\(x\\) \u2264 99)?\n\n- **Trial and Error:**  \n  - Let's start with \\(x = 10\\):\n    \\[\n    y = \\frac{50}{49} \\times 10 = \\frac{500}{49} \\approx 10.204\n    \\]\n    - **Reflection:** Not an integer.\n  \n  - Try \\(x = 20\\):\n    \\[\n    y = \\frac{50}{49} \\times 20 = \\frac{1000}{49} \\approx 20.408\n    \\]\n    - **Reflection:** Still not an integer.\n  \n  - **Thought:** This might take a while. Is there a better way?\n\n#### **Alternative Approach: Factoring the Equation**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Instead of trial and error, maybe I can manipulate the equation to find a suitable \\(x\\).\n\n- **Wait, Let Me Reconsider:**  \n  Let\u2019s rearrange the equation to see if we can find a pattern.\n\n- **Rewriting the Equation:**  \n  \\[\n  50x = 49y \\implies \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{49}{50}\n  \\]\n \n- **Reflection:**  \n  This suggests that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are in the ratio of 49 to 50. So, \\(x\\) is 49/50 of \\(y\\).\n\n#### **Finding Exact Values**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are in a simple ratio, I can express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\), or vice versa.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{49}{50}y\n  \\]\n  \n- **Wait, Let Me Check:**  \n  But since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) need to be integers, let's find the smallest integer values that satisfy this ratio.\n\n- **Simplifying the Ratio:**  \n  - Multiply both sides by 50 to eliminate the fraction:\n    \\[\n    50x = 49y\n    \\]\n    \n- **Interpretation:**  \n  This means for every 50 units of \\(x\\), \\(y\\) is 49 units. But since we're dealing with two-digit numbers, let's scale down.\n\n- **Thought:**  \n  If I divide both sides by 1, it doesn't change the equation, but I need to find \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that this holds within two digits.\n\n#### **Using Proportions to Find \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)**\n\n- **Alternative Idea:**  \n  Let's set \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be multiples of 49 and 50, respectively, within the two-digit range.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  - Suppose \\(x = 49k\\) and \\(y = 50k\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n  - But since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) must be two-digit numbers, let's find the appropriate \\(k\\).\n\n- **Finding \\(k\\):**  \n  - \\(49k\\) must be a two-digit number: \\(10 \u2264 49k \u2264 99\\).\n  \n- **Solving for \\(k\\):**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{10}{49} \u2264 k \u2264 \\frac{99}{49} \\implies 0.204 \u2264 k \u2264 2.02\n  \\]\n  - **Reflection:** So, \\(k\\) can be 1 or 2.\n\n- **Testing \\(k = 1\\):**\n  - \\(x = 49 \\times 1 = 49\\)\n  - \\(y = 50 \\times 1 = 50\\)\n  \n- **Check:**  \n  - \\(\\frac{49 + 50}{2} = \\frac{99}{2} = 49.5\\)\n  - Decimal number = \\(49.50\\)\n\n- **Wait:**  \n  The average is 49.5, and the decimal number is 49.50. That matches!\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This solution works. But let\u2019s double-check with \\(k = 2\\) to ensure there are no other possibilities.\n\n#### **Testing \\(k = 2\\):**\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  - \\(x = 49 \\times 2 = 98\\)\n  - \\(y = 50 \\times 2 = 100\\)\n  \n- **Wait, Is This Valid?:**  \n  But \\(y = 100\\) is not a two-digit number, so \\(k = 2\\) is invalid.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Hence, \\(k = 1\\) is the only valid solution within the two-digit range.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Before finalizing, let's verify the solution one more time to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Given:**  \n  - \\(x = 49\\)\n  - \\(y = 50\\)\n\n- **Average Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{49 + 50}{2} = \\frac{99}{2} = 49.5\n  \\]\n\n- **Decimal Number:**  \n  \\[\n  49.50\n  \\]\n\n- **Comparison:**  \n  - The average (49.5) matches the decimal number (49.50).\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Everything checks out. The solution is correct.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy:**  \n  Initially, trial and error seemed inefficient, but by recognizing the ratio between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we streamlined the process. This approach ensured that we found the correct integers without unnecessary computation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>49</ANSWER>\n\n**Smaller Integer: 49**\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Thinking Aloud:**  \n  Exploring multiple strategies helps in understanding the problem better. Initial ideas may lead to more efficient methods upon reflection.\n\n- **Trial and Error:**  \n  While useful, it can be time-consuming. Recognizing patterns or relationships can expedite finding the solution.\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  Always double-check the solution by plugging values back into the original problem to ensure correctness.\n\n- **Flexibility:**  \n  Being open to changing strategies when the initial approach doesn't yield quick results is crucial in problem-solving.\n\n---\n\nAlright! I hope this step-by-step walkthrough captures the essence of solving the problem authentically, just as a human would. Let me know if there's anything else I can do!",
  "ground_truth": "Let the two numbers be $m=AB$ and $n=CD$ (where $A,B,C$ and $D$ are digits). The average of $m$ and $n$ is $\\frac{m+n}{2}$ and the number formed by writing $m$ before the decimal point and $n$ after the decimal point is: $$AB.CD = AB + 0.CD = AB+\\frac{CD}{100} = m+\\frac{n}{100}.$$ Setting these equal gives: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{m+n}{2} &= m+\\frac{n}{100}\\\\\n50m+50n &= 100m+n\\\\\n49n &= 50m\n\\end{align*} From this it follows that $n$ a multiple of 50. As $n$ is a 2-digit positive integer this means that $n=50$. So now $50m = 49n = 49\\cdot 50$, so $m=49$. Thus the integers are $49$ and $50$, so the smaller integer is $\\boxed{49}$."
