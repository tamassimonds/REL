  "solution": "Absolutely, let's streamline this into a coherent and complete solution while preserving the original thinking process. I'll maintain the essence of brainstorming, reflecting, and checking at each step to ensure the approach remains natural and authentic.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at the problem:\n\nFor how many real numbers \\( a \\) does the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + ax + 6a = 0 \\) have only integer roots?\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis reminds me of problems involving quadratics with integer roots. I vaguely recall using Vieta's formulas or factoring the quadratic, but I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps exploring different strategies could help.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Vieta's Formulas:**  \n   Use relationships between roots and coefficients.\n\n2. **Factoring the Quadratic:**  \n   Express the quadratic as a product of two linear factors with integer roots.\n\n3. **Discriminant Approach:**  \n   Ensure the discriminant is a perfect square for integer roots.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nVieta's formulas and factoring seem more straightforward for dealing with integer roots, but the discriminant method might also be useful to ensure real roots. Let's start by experimenting with Vieta's formulas.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Vieta's Formulas**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nVieta's formulas state that for a quadratic \\( x^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) with roots \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\):\n\n- Sum of roots: \\( r_1 + r_2 = -b \\)\n- Product of roots: \\( r_1 r_2 = c \\)\n\nApplying this to our equation:\n\n- \\( r_1 + r_2 = -a \\)\n- \\( r_1 r_2 = 6a \\)\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nSince \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) are integers, maybe I can express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\). Let's see where this leads.\n\n**Calculations:**  \nFrom the sum of roots:  \n\\[ a = -(r_1 + r_2) \\]\n\nSubstituting into the product of roots:  \n\\[ r_1 r_2 = 6a = 6(-r_1 - r_2) \\]  \n\\[ r_1 r_2 = -6r_1 - 6r_2 \\]\n\n**Wait a Minute:**  \nThat substitution complicates things and doesn't seem right. Maybe it's better to express \\( a \\) directly from both equations and set them equal.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, that path isn't helpful. Let's backtrack and try a different approach using Vieta's formulas.\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting Strategy 1: Solving for \\( a \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nInstead, let's express \\( a \\) from both Vieta's equations and set them equal to find a relationship between \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\).\n\nFrom the sum of roots:  \n\\[ a = -(r_1 + r_2) \\]\n\nFrom the product of roots:  \n\\[ a = \\frac{r_1 r_2}{6} \\]\n\n**Setting Them Equal:**  \n\\[ -(r_1 + r_2) = \\frac{r_1 r_2}{6} \\]  \n\\[ -6(r_1 + r_2) = r_1 r_2 \\]  \n\\[ 6r_1 + 6r_2 + r_1 r_2 = 0 \\] \\tag{1} \\]\n\n**Interpreting Equation (1):**  \nThis is a symmetric equation in \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\). Perhaps I can factor it or find integer solutions.\n\n**Factoring Attempt:**  \n\\[ r_1 r_2 + 6r_1 + 6r_2 = 0 \\]  \n\\[ r_1 r_2 + 6r_1 + 6r_2 + 36 = 36 \\]  \n\\[ (r_1 + 6)(r_2 + 6) = 36 \\] \\tag{2} \\]\n\n**Aha Moment:**  \nWait, this looks promising! By factoring, I can see that \\( (r_1 + 6) \\) and \\( (r_2 + 6) \\) must be integer pairs whose product is 36.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet's verify the factoring:  \n\\[ (r_1 + 6)(r_2 + 6) = r_1 r_2 + 6r_1 + 6r_2 + 36 \\]  \nYep, that matches the left side of equation (1). So, the factoring is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis approach seems to be working. Now, let's proceed by listing all integer pairs that multiply to 36.\n\n---\n\n### **Listing Integer Pairs for \\( (r_1 + 6) \\) and \\( (r_2 + 6) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince \\( (r_1 + 6)(r_2 + 6) = 36 \\), let's find all integer pairs \\( (m, n) \\) such that \\( m \\cdot n = 36 \\). Then, set \\( r_1 + 6 = m \\) and \\( r_2 + 6 = n \\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \nPossible integer pairs \\( (m, n) \\):  \n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(1, 36), \\quad & (36, 1), \\\\\n(2, 18), \\quad & (18, 2), \\\\\n(3, 12), \\quad & (12, 3), \\\\\n(4, 9), \\quad & (9, 4), \\\\\n(6, 6), \\quad & (-1, -36), \\\\\n(-36, -1), \\quad & (-2, -18), \\\\\n(-18, -2), \\quad & (-3, -12), \\\\\n(-12, -3), \\quad & (-4, -9), \\\\\n(-9, -4), \\quad & (-6, -6)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat's a lot of pairs! But since the quadratic has only two roots, some of these might be duplicates or not yield distinct values of \\( a \\). Let's proceed carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating \\( a \\) for Each Pair**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFor each pair \\( (m, n) \\), we'll set:\n\n\\[ r_1 + 6 = m \\]  \n\\[ r_2 + 6 = n \\]  \n\nThen,  \n\\[ a = -(r_1 + r_2) = -(m - 6 + n - 6) = -(m + n - 12) \\]\n\n**Calculations:**  \n\n1. \\( (m, n) = (1, 36) \\):  \n   \\[ a = -(1 + 36 - 12) = -25 \\]\n\n2. \\( (m, n) = (2, 18) \\):  \n   \\[ a = -(2 + 18 - 12) = -8 \\]\n\n3. \\( (m, n) = (3, 12) \\):  \n   \\[ a = -(3 + 12 - 12) = -3 \\]\n\n4. \\( (m, n) = (4, 9) \\):  \n   \\[ a = -(4 + 9 - 12) = -1 \\]\n\n5. \\( (m, n) = (6, 6) \\):  \n   \\[ a = -(6 + 6 - 12) = 0 \\]\n\n6. \\( (m, n) = (-1, -36) \\):  \n   \\[ a = -(-1 + (-36) - 12) = 49 \\]\n\n7. \\( (m, n) = (-2, -18) \\):  \n   \\[ a = -(-2 + (-18) - 12) = 32 \\]\n\n8. \\( (m, n) = (-3, -12) \\):  \n   \\[ a = -(-3 + (-12) - 12) = 27 \\]\n\n9. \\( (m, n) = (-4, -9) \\):  \n   \\[ a = -(-4 + (-9) - 12) = 25 \\]\n\n10. \\( (m, n) = (-6, -6) \\):  \n    \\[ a = -(-6 + (-6) - 12) = 24 \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nBefore finalizing, let's verify one of these calculations to ensure correctness.\n\n**Verification Example:**  \nLet's check \\( (m, n) = (4, 9) \\):\n\n- \\( r_1 + 6 = 4 \\Rightarrow r_1 = -2 \\)\n- \\( r_2 + 6 = 9 \\Rightarrow r_2 = 3 \\)\n\nSum of roots:  \n\\[ r_1 + r_2 = -2 + 3 = 1 \\Rightarrow a = -1 \\]\n\nProduct of roots:  \n\\[ r_1 r_2 = (-2)(3) = -6 \\]  \n\\[ 6a = 6(-1) = -6 \\]  \n\nBoth conditions are satisfied. So, the calculation is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe approach is working well. Now, let's finalize the list of distinct \\( a \\) values.\n\n---\n\n### **Listing Distinct \\( a \\) Values**\n\nBased on the calculations, the distinct \\( a \\) values are:\n\n1. \\( a = -25 \\)\n2. \\( a = -8 \\)\n3. \\( a = -3 \\)\n4. \\( a = -1 \\)\n5. \\( a = 0 \\)\n6. \\( a = 24 \\)\n7. \\( a = 25 \\)\n8. \\( a = 27 \\)\n9. \\( a = 32 \\)\n10. \\( a = 49 \\)\n\n**Counting Distinct Values:**  \nThere are 10 distinct \\( a \\) values.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet's ensure no duplicates are present and that all values make sense. Each \\( a \\) corresponds to a unique pair of roots, so we're good.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Verifying One More Case**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo be absolutely sure, let's verify another case where \\( a = 24 \\).\n\n**Pair:**  \n\\( (m, n) = (-6, -6) \\)\n\n**Calculations:**  \n\\[ r_1 + 6 = -6 \\Rightarrow r_1 = -12 \\]  \n\\[ r_2 + 6 = -6 \\Rightarrow r_2 = -12 \\]\n\nSum of roots:  \n\\[ r_1 + r_2 = -12 + (-12) = -24 \\Rightarrow a = 24 \\]\n\nProduct of roots:  \n\\[ r_1 r_2 = (-12)(-12) = 144 \\]  \n\\[ 6a = 6(24) = 144 \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nBoth Vieta's conditions are satisfied. Therefore, \\( a = 24 \\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The approach is correct, and the final list of \\( a \\) values is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThere are **10** real numbers \\( a \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + ax + 6a = 0 \\) has only integer roots.  \nThe distinct values of \\( a \\) are:  \n- \\( a = -25 \\)  \n- \\( a = -8 \\)  \n- \\( a = -3 \\)  \n- \\( a = -1 \\)  \n- \\( a = 0 \\)  \n- \\( a = 24 \\)  \n- \\( a = 25 \\)  \n- \\( a = 27 \\)  \n- \\( a = 32 \\)  \n- \\( a = 49 \\)  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBy exploring multiple strategies and carefully checking each step, we've successfully determined the distinct real numbers \\( a \\) that satisfy the given conditions. The initial missteps helped guide us toward the correct approach, ensuring the solution's accuracy.\n\nThere you have it! By maintaining a thoughtful and reflective approach throughout, we've arrived at the correct answer while keeping the thinking process clear and natural.",
  "ground_truth": "Let $r$ and $s$ be the integer roots. Then by Vieta's formulas, $r+s=-a$ and $rs=6a.$ Thus, \\[rs + 6(r+s) = 0.\\]Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we have \\[rs + 6(r+s) + 36 = 36 \\implies (r+6)(s+6) = 36.\\]The number $36 = 2^2 3^2$ has $2(2+1)(2+1) = 18$ factors, both positive and negative; they come in $8$ pairs, with singletons $6$ and $-6.$ However, since the order of $r$ and $s$ does not matter, each pair should only be counted once, so there are $8 + 1 + 1 = \\boxed{10}$ possible values for $a.$"
