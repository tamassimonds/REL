  "problem": "My three-digit code is 023. Reckha can't choose a code that is the same as mine in two or more of the three digit-positions, nor that is the same as mine except for switching the positions of two digits (so 320 and 203, for example, are forbidden, but 302 is fine). Reckha can otherwise choose any three-digit code where each digit is in the set $\\{0, 1, 2, ..., 9\\}$. How many codes are available for Reckha?",
  "solution": "Sure, let's piece this solution together into a coherent, complete write-up while maintaining the original final answer. We'll walk through the thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and ensuring the solution is clear and logical.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n** brainstorming:**  \nAlright, let's dive in. The challenge is to determine how many three-digit codes Reckha can choose that don't violate specific conditions related to my code, **023**. This reminds me of combinatorics problems where certain combinations are restricted.\n\n** initial ideas:**  \n- **Total Codes Minus Invalid Codes:** Calculate all possible codes and subtract those that violate the conditions.\n- **List All Forbidden Codes:** Identify all codes that match mine in prohibited ways and ensure no overcounting.\n\n** reflection:**  \nActually, since there are multiple restrictions\u2014codes matching in two or more positions and codes that are simple permutations of mine (023)\u2014handling them separately and then combining the results might be the most effective approach. Let's explore different strategies to see which one works best.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Total Codes Minus Invalid Codes**\n\n** thought process:**  \nStart by calculating the total number of three-digit codes, then subtract the codes that violate Reckha's restrictions.\n\n** calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Total Codes} = 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 1,000\n\\]\n(Hundred for each digit: 0\u20139)\n\n** reflection:**  \nBut wait\u2014subtracting invalid codes requires carefully identifying all forbidden cases, which might get tricky with overlapping conditions. Is there a better way?\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Counting Forbidden Codes by Conditions**\n\n** thought process:**  \nPerhaps it's better to identify all the codes that violate each condition separately and then use the inclusion-exclusion principle to avoid overcounting.\n\n** steps involved:**\n\n1. **Identify codes matching in two or more positions with 023.**\n2. **Identify codes that are simple permutations of 023 by switching two digits.**\n\n** reflection:**  \nThis seems more systematic. Let's proceed with this approach to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution Using Strategy 2**\n\n#### **Step 1: Identify Codes Matching in Two or More Positions**\n\n** thought process:**  \nFind all codes that match **023** in at least two positions.\n\n** calculations:**\n\n1. **Matching All Three Positions:**\n   - **Only Code:** 023 itself.\n   - **Count:** 1 code.\n\n2. **Matching Exactly Two Positions:**\n   \n- **First and Second Digits Match (02\\_):**  \n  - Third digit can be anything except 3:  \n    - Codes: **020, 021, 022, ..., 029**  \n    - **Count:** 9 codes  \n\n- **First and Third Digits Match (0\\_3):**  \n  - Second digit can be anything except 2:  \n    - Codes: **003, 013, 033, ..., 093**  \n    - **Count:** 9 codes  \n\n- **Second and Third Digits Match (\\_23):**  \n  - First digit can be anything except 0:  \n    - Codes: **123, 223, 323, ..., 923**  \n    - **Count:** 9 codes  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Matching Two or More Positions} = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 \\text{ codes}\n\\]\n\n** quick check:**  \nIncluding the code that matches all three positions (023 itself):\n\n\\[\n1 (\\text{all three positions}) + 27 (\\text{exactly two positions}) = 28 \\text{ codes}\n\\]\n\n** reflection:**  \nThat makes sense. So, there are **28** codes that match mine in two or more positions.\n\n#### **Step 2: Identify Codes That Are Permutations by Switching Two Digits**\n\n** thought process:**  \nNow, find codes that are simple swaps of **023**, which are also forbidden.\n\n** calculations:**\n\n- **Swap the First and Second Digits:**  \n  - Code: **203**  \n\n- **Swap the First and Third Digits:**  \n  - Code: **320**  \n\n- **Swap the Second and Third Digits:**  \n  - Code: **032**  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Permutations by Switching Two Digits} = 3 \\text{ codes}\n\\]\n\n** quick check:**  \nSwapping digits in **023** gives us three unique codes: **203, 320,** and **032**. That seems correct.\n\n#### **Step 3: Combine Forbidden Cases Using Inclusion-Exclusion**\n\n** thought process:**  \nSince some codes might be counted in both conditions (e.g., **023** itself), use the inclusion-exclusion principle to avoid overcounting.\n\n** calculations:**\n\n- **Total Forbidden Codes:**  \n  - **Matching Two or More Positions:** 28 codes (including **023** itself).  \n  - **Permutations by Switching Two Digits:** 3 codes.  \n\n- **Overlap:**  \n  - **Code 023:** Appears in the first set (matching all three positions) but not in the second set since permutations require different positions.\n\n** inclusion-exclusion formula:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Total Forbidden} = (\\text{Matching Two or More Positions}) + (\\text{Permutations}) - (\\text{Overlap})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total Forbidden} = 28 + 3 - 0 = 31 \\text{ codes}\n\\]\n\n** understanding the overlap:**  \nSince **023** is already accounted for in the 28 codes matching two or more positions, and the permutations are distinct codes, there's no additional overlap beyond **023**.\n\n** reflection:**  \nSo, there are **31** unique codes that Reckha cannot choose.\n\n#### **Step 4: Calculate the Valid Codes Available for Reckha**\n\n** thought process:**  \nSubtract the total forbidden codes from the total possible codes to find the valid ones.\n\n** calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Valid Codes} = \\text{Total Codes} - \\text{Total Forbidden}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Valid Codes} = 1,000 - 31 = 969 \\text{ codes}\n\\]\n\n** quick check:**  \nDoes this number make sense? Out of 1,000 possible codes, eliminating 31 specific ones leaves **969**. Seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n** does the approach make sense?:**  \nYes, by systematically identifying and excluding the forbidden codes using combinatorics and ensuring no overcounting through inclusion-exclusion, the solution seems solid.\n\n** verification:**  \n- Double-checking the count of forbidden codes aligns with the conditions provided.\n- The arithmetic checks out: 1,000 total codes minus 31 forbidden equals **969** valid codes.\n\n** alternative approach consideration:**  \nInitially considered subtracting forbidden codes directly, but recognizing potential overlaps led to a more accurate inclusion-exclusion method. This ensured precise counting without overcounting forbidden cases.\n\n** final thought:**  \nThe step-by-step approach validated the strategy's correctness, providing confidence in the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> solution **\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Valid Codes Available for Reckha: } 969\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough a detailed, step-by-step exploration, including brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their validity, and carefully applying combinatorial principles, we've determined that Reckha has **969** valid three-digit codes to choose from. This approach ensured accuracy by systematically accounting for all restrictions and verifying each step along the way.",
  "ground_truth": "There are $10^3 = 1000$ possible codes without restrictions.  There are $3\\cdot 9 = 27$ codes that differ in only one spot from mine (three choices for the differing digit and nine choices for its value), 3 codes that result from transposing two digits (have three choices for the fixed digits), and Reckha also can't use my code itself.  Thus Reckha has a total of $1000-27-3-1 = \\boxed{969}$ available codes."
