  "solution": "Absolutely, let's put everything together into a cohesive and complete solution. I'll maintain the original answer but refine the process for clarity and coherence.\n\n---\n\n## **Step-by-Step Solution: Finding the Radius \\( r \\) of the Sphere**\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to determine the radius \\( r \\) of a sphere in which a rectangular box \\( P \\) is perfectly inscribed. The given data includes:\n\n1. **Surface Area of \\( P \\):** 384\n2. **Sum of the Lengths of All 12 Edges of \\( P \\):** 112\n\n**Objective:** Find \\( r \\).\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\n- **Initial Ideas:**\n  - The problem involves a box inscribed in a sphere, hinting at geometric relationships like the Pythagorean Theorem.\n  - The sphere's radius might be related to the box's diagonal.\n  - Given surface area and edge sums could help in setting up equations for the box's dimensions.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. Use the diagonal of the box to relate it to the sphere's radius.\n  2. Set up equations based on surface area and edge sums.\n  3. Solve a system of equations to find the box's dimensions and, subsequently, \\( r \\).\n\n**Reflection:** Starting with the box's diagonal seems promising since it directly connects to the sphere's radius.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Using the Diagonal of the Box**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Box's Dimensions:** Let\u2019s denote them as \\( x, y, z \\).\n- **Diagonal \\( d \\):** According to the Pythagorean Theorem,\n  \\[\n  d = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\n  \\]\n- **Relation to Sphere:** The box is inscribed, so the diagonal equals the sphere's diameter:\n  \\[\n  d = 2r \\implies \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 2r\n  \\]\n\n**Forming Equation:**\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (2r)^2 = 4r^2 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** This makes sense; the diagonal spans the sphere's diameter.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Relating Surface Area and Edge Lengths**\n\n**Given:**\n\n- **Surface Area \\( S \\):** \n  \\[\n  2(xy + yz + zx) = 384 \\implies xy + yz + zx = 192 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Sum of Edges \\( E \\):**\n  \\[\n  4(x + y + z) = 112 \\implies x + y + z = 28 \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:** These equations relate the box\u2019s dimensions to its surface area and total edge length.\n\n**Check:** Both equations are straightforward and align with the given data.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Current Equations:**\n\n1. \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4r^2 \\) (Equation 1)\n2. \\( xy + yz + zx = 192 \\) (Equation 2)\n3. \\( x + y + z = 28 \\) (Equation 3)\n\n**Alternative Strategy:** Instead of solving for \\( x, y, z \\) individually, let's express everything in terms of \\( r \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Expressing in Terms of \\( r \\)**\n\n**Expanding Equation 3:**\n\n\\[\n(x + y + z)^2 = 28^2 = 784\n\\]\n\n**Expanding the Square:**\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx) = 784\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Equation 2:**\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(192) = 784 \\implies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 384 = 784\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 784 - 384 = 400\n\\]\n\n**Comparing with Equation 1:**\n\\[\n4r^2 = 400 \\implies r^2 = 100 \\implies r = 10\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute:** This solution seems straightforward. Let\u2019s double-check to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Quick Checks:**\n\n1. **Diagonal Length:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{400} = 20 = 2r \\implies r = 10\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Surface Area Condition:**\n   \\[\n   xy + yz + zx = 192 \\quad \\text{(holds true)}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Sum of Edges:**\n   \\[\n   x + y + z = 28 \\quad \\text{(holds true)}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:** All conditions are satisfied with \\( r = 10 \\). The calculations are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{r = 10}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorming and Strategy Selection:** Initially considered multiple approaches, but focusing on the box\u2019s diagonal provided a direct path to the solution.\n\n- **Step-by-Step Calculations:** Carefully set up and solved equations relating the box's dimensions to the sphere's radius.\n\n- **Verification:** Consistently checked each step to ensure correctness, which confirmed the validity of the solution.\n\n- **Final Check:** Validated that all given conditions are met with the calculated radius.\n\n**<ANSWER> r = 10 </ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\nBy thoughtfully exploring different strategies, consistently reflecting and verifying each step, and maintaining a clear focus on the relationships between the box and the sphere, we confidently arrived at the correct solution: \\( r = 10 \\).",
  "ground_truth": "Let the dimensions of $P$ be $x$, $y$, and $z$. The sum of the lengths of the edges of $P$ is $4(x+y+z)$, and the surface area of $P$ is $2xy+2yz+2xz$, so \\[\nx+y+z=28 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 2xy+2yz+2xz=384.\n\\] Each internal diagonal of $P$ is a diameter of the sphere, so \\begin{align*}\n(2r)^2&=(x^2+y^2+z^2)\\\\\n&=(x+y+z)^2-(2xy+2xz+2yz) \\\\\n&= 28^2-384\\\\& = 400.\n\\end{align*} So $2r = 20$ and  $r=\\boxed{10}$.\n\nNote: There are infinitely many positive solutions of the system $x+y+z=28$, $2xy+2yz+2xz=384$, so there are infinitely many non-congruent boxes meeting the given conditions, but each can be inscribed in a sphere of radius 10."
