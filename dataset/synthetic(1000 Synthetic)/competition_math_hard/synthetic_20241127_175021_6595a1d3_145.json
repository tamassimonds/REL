  "problem": "At Central Middle School the $108$ students who take the AMC 8 meet in the evening to talk about problems and eat an average of two cookies apiece. Walter and Gretel are baking Bonnie's Best Bar Cookies this year. Their recipe, which makes a pan of $15$ cookies, lists these items:\n\n$\\bullet$ $1\\frac{1}{2}$ cups of flour\n\n$\\bullet$ $2$ eggs\n\n$\\bullet$ $3$ tablespoons butter\n\n$\\bullet$ $\\frac{3}{4}$ cups sugar\n\n$\\bullet$ $1$ package of chocolate drops\n\nThey will make only full recipes, no partial recipes.\n\nThey learn that a big concert is scheduled for the same night and attendance will be down $25\\%.$ How many recipes of cookies should they make for their smaller party?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let\u2019s craft a complete solution by integrating all our reflections and calculations smoothly. I'll maintain the original thought process while ensuring the final answer remains unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nAt Central Middle School, **108 students** usually attend the AMC 8 meeting, each consuming an average of **two cookies**. However, due to a big concert, attendance will drop by **25%**. Walter and Gretel need to determine how many batches of Bonnie's Best Bar Cookies to bake, with each recipe yielding **15 cookies**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Reduced Attendance**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If attendance decreases by **25%**, only **75%** of the students will attend.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Reduced Attendance} = 108 \\times 0.75 = 81 \\text{ students}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **25%** of **108** is **27**, so **108 - 27 = 81**. This confirms the calculation is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determine Total Cookies Needed**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Each attending student eats **two cookies**. Multiply the number of students by **two** to find the total cookies required.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cookies Needed} = 81 \\times 2 = 162 \\text{ cookies}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **80** students need **160** cookies; adding **2** more for the extra student makes it **162**. The calculation holds up.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate Number of Recipes/Batches**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Each recipe yields **15 cookies**. Compute how many full recipes are needed to make at least **162 cookies**.\n- Since only full recipes can be baked, rounding up is necessary.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Recipes} = \\frac{162}{15} = 10.8\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- You can't bake **10.8** recipes. Therefore, round up to **11** full recipes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Full Recipes} = \\lceil 10.8 \\rceil = 11\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **10 recipes** would yield **150 cookies**, which is **12 cookies short**.\n- Baking **11 recipes** will produce:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 15 = 165 \\text{ cookies}\n\\]\n\n- This provides **3 extra cookies**, ensuring all students are accommodated.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Double-Checking the Work**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Before finalizing, confirm that **11 recipes** yield enough cookies.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 15 = 165 \\text{ cookies}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Needed: **162 cookies**\n- Producing: **165 cookies**\n\n- This results in **3 extra cookies**, which is acceptable and preferable to falling short.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER> solution\n\nWalter and Gretel should bake **11** full recipes of cookies to accommodate the reduced attendance.\n\n</ANSWER> solution\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Strategy Was Effective:** Calculating reduced attendance, determining total cookies needed, and then figuring out the number of full recipes worked well.\n\n- **Frequent Checks Ensured Accuracy:** Reflecting after each step helped catch and correct potential issues, like the necessity to round up the number of recipes.\n\n- **Extra Information Was Identified:** The ingredients list was irrelevant to the problem, confirming that focusing on the essential data was the right approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy methodically analyzing each step and verifying calculations along the way, Walter and Gretel can confidently conclude that baking **11 full recipes** will sufficiently meet the cookie demand for the reduced attendance at the AMC 8 meeting.\n\n---\n\nThere you have it\u2014a coherent and complete solution that maintains the integrity of the original thought process while presenting a polished final answer.",
  "ground_truth": "The $108\\cdot 0.75=81$ students need $2$ cookies each so $162$ cookies are to be baked. Since $162\\div 15=10.8,$ Walter and Gretel must bake $\\boxed{11}$ recipes. A few leftovers are a good thing!"
