  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it by hand. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness along the way, and reflecting to ensure the solution makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nWe're given an infinite geometric series:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{8}{27} - \\frac{32}{243} + \\dots\n\\]\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nAt first glance, this looks like a classic geometric series because each term seems to involve multiplying the previous term by some constant ratio. But I need to confirm if that's actually the case. Infinite series can be tricky, so it's essential to determine if it converges and, if so, find its sum.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Identify the Common Ratio (\\( r \\)):**  \n   If it's a geometric series, each term should be the previous term multiplied by a constant ratio \\( r \\).\n\n2. **Check for Convergence:**  \n   For an infinite geometric series to converge, the absolute value of \\( r \\) must be less than 1 (\\(|r| < 1\\)).\n\n3. **Use the Sum Formula:**  \n   If the series converges, I can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\n   \\]\n   \n   where \\( a \\) is the first term.\n\n**Initial Preference:**  \nI think starting by identifying the common ratio is a good idea. If I can find \\( r \\) and confirm that \\(|r| < 1\\), then I can proceed to use the sum formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying the Common Ratio (\\( r \\))**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's see if there\u2019s a consistent ratio between successive terms. I'll divide each term by the previous one to find \\( r \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **First Ratio:**  \n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{-\\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{3}{2}} = -\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = -\\frac{4}{9}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Check:**  \n  Wait a minute, that seems off. Let me double-check my multiplication.\n\n  \\[\n  -\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = -\\frac{4}{9}\n  \\]\n  \n  Nope, that's correct. But maybe I made a mistake in my approach.\n\n- **Second Ratio:**  \n  Let me try the next pair to confirm.\n  \n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{\\frac{8}{27}}{-\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{8}{27} \\times -\\frac{3}{2} = -\\frac{24}{54} = -\\frac{4}{9}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Reflection:**  \n  Okay, so the ratio is consistent. It seems that \\( r = -\\frac{4}{9} \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe common ratio \\( r \\) is \\(-\\frac{4}{9}\\).\n\n**<SUMMARY> Found common ratio \\( r = -\\frac{4}{9} \\) </SUMMARY>**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Checking for Convergence**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI know that for an infinite geometric series to converge, the absolute value of the common ratio must be less than 1 (\\(|r| < 1\\)). Let's check that.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n|r| = \\left| -\\frac{4}{9} \\right| = \\frac{4}{9} < 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSince \\(|r| < 1\\), the series does converge. This is good news because it means I can proceed to find the sum using the formula.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe series converges.\n\n**<SUMMARY> Series converges since \\(|r| < 1\\) </SUMMARY>**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Sum Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have \\( r \\) and know the series converges, I can use the sum formula for an infinite geometric series:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is the first term.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nGiven:\n\\[\na = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = -\\frac{4}{9}\n\\]\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{1 - \\left(-\\frac{4}{9}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{1 + \\frac{4}{9}}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Denominator:**\n\nFirst, let's simplify \\(1 + \\frac{4}{9}\\):\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{9}{9} + \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{13}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Plugging Back:**\n\\[\nS = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{\\frac{13}{9}} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{9}{13} = \\frac{27}{26}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat simplifies nicely. But let me double-check the arithmetic to ensure there are no mistakes.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\times 9}{2 \\times 13} = \\frac{27}{26}\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe sum of the series is \\(\\frac{27}{26}\\).\n\n**<SUMMARY> Calculated sum \\( S = \\frac{27}{26} \\) </SUMMARY>**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI always like to verify my solutions to ensure accuracy. Let\u2019s see if this makes sense by considering the series's behavior and possibly using another method to confirm.\n\n1. **Estimate the Sum:**  \n   The first term is \\(\\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\\). The subsequent terms alternate signs and decrease in magnitude. The negative terms should partially cancel out the positive ones, leading to a sum slightly greater than 1.\n\n2. **Alternative Method - Partial Sums:**  \n   Calculate the sum of the first few terms to see if it approaches \\(\\frac{27}{26} \\approx 1.038\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **First Term:**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\n  \\]\n  \n- **Second Term:**  \n  \\[\n  1.5 - \\frac{2}{3} = 1.5 - 0.6667 \\approx 0.8333\n  \\]\n  \n- **Third Term:**  \n  \\[\n  0.8333 + \\frac{8}{27} \\approx 0.8333 + 0.2963 \\approx 1.1296\n  \\]\n  \n- **Fourth Term:**  \n  \\[\n  1.1296 - \\frac{32}{243} \\approx 1.1296 - 0.1316 \\approx 0.9980\n  \\]\n  \n- **Continuing:**  \n  As I add more terms, the sum oscillates closer to 1.038.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe partial sums are converging towards \\(\\frac{27}{26}\\), which confirms that our calculated sum is likely correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe calculated sum \\(\\frac{27}{26}\\) is consistent with the behavior of the series.\n\n**<SUMMARY> Verified sum through partial sums, confirming \\( S = \\frac{27}{26} \\) </SUMMARY>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, identifying the common ratio, checking for convergence, applying the sum formula, and verifying the solution through partial sums, we conclude that the sum of the infinite geometric series is:\n\n\\(<ANSWER> S = \\frac{27}{26} </ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Learning Points**\n\n- **Identifying the Common Ratio:**  \n  Confirming \\( r \\) by calculating ratios between successive terms was essential to verify the geometric nature of the series.\n\n- **Convergence Criteria:**  \n  Ensuring \\(|r| < 1\\) was crucial to applying the sum formula safely.\n\n- **Verification Through Partial Sums:**  \n  Calculating the sum of the first few terms provided a practical check, reinforcing the correctness of the analytical solution.\n\n- **Importance of Double-Checking Calculations:**  \n  Initial missteps in identifying \\( r \\) reminded me to always verify each step, especially when dealing with fractions and negative signs.\n\n**<SUMMARY> Recapped key steps and learning points </SUMMARY>**\n\n---\n\n*By approaching the problem methodically\u2014brainstorming, checking each step, and verifying the final answer\u2014we ensured an accurate and reliable solution.*",
