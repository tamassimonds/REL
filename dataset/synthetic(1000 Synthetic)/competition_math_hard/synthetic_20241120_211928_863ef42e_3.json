The cost of gas was then evenly redistributed among all of the friends. The cost for each of the original 3 decreased by $\\$$11.00. What was the total cost of the gas, in dollars?",

    "working_out": "### **First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, it seems straightforward: three friends are splitting gas costs, then two more join, and the cost per person decreases by $11.00 for the original three. We need to find the total gas cost.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Proportional Sharing:** Perhaps the cost per person is directly proportional to the number of people.\n- **Cost Difference Calculation:** The decrease of $11.00 per person might be a clue to set up an equation.\n- **Total Cost Representation:** Maybe representing the total cost in terms of the number of friends will help.\n\nI'm inclined to think that setting up an equation based on the decrease in cost per person is the way to go. But let's explore different strategies to ensure I pick the most efficient one.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Proportionality:**\n   - **Idea:** Initially, each of the three paid a certain amount. When two more joined, the total cost was split among five.\n   - **Approach:** Calculate the original cost per person and the new cost per person, then use the $11.00 decrease to find the total cost.\n\n2. **Algebraic Equation:**\n   - **Idea:** Use variables to represent the total cost and set up an equation based on the given decrease in cost per person.\n   - **Approach:** Let the total cost be \\( C \\). Initially, each of the three paid \\( \\frac{C}{3} \\). After two more joined, each of the five paid \\( \\frac{C}{5} \\). The difference is $11.00.\n\n3. **Cost Per Person Difference:**\n   - **Idea:** Focus on the difference in cost per person before and after the two friends joined.\n   - **Approach:** Compute the difference in cost per person multiplied by the number of original friends to equate to the total decrease.\n\nI'm leaning towards the **Algebraic Equation** method since it seems the most straightforward for setting up and solving. But I'll keep the other strategies in mind in case I hit a snag.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution Using Algebraic Equation:**\n\n**Step 1: Define the Total Cost**\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total cost of the gas as \\( C \\).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Initial Cost per Person**\n\nInitially, there are 3 friends splitting the cost:\n\\[\n\\text{Initial Cost per Person} = \\frac{C}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate New Cost per Person After 2 More Friends Join**\n\nWith 2 additional friends, the total number of friends is now 5:\n\\[\n\\text{New Cost per Person} = \\frac{C}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Establish the Decrease in Cost per Person**\n\nAccording to the problem, the cost for each of the original three decreased by $11.00:\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{3} - \\frac{C}{5} = 11\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis equation seems correct. It represents the decrease in cost per person due to the addition of two more friends. Let\u2019s proceed to solve it.\n\n**Step 5: Solve the Equation for \\( C \\)**\n\nFirst, find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{3} - \\frac{C}{5} = \\frac{5C}{15} - \\frac{3C}{15} = \\frac{2C}{15}\n\\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{2C}{15} = 11\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( C \\), multiply both sides by 15:\n\\[\n2C = 165\n\\]\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nC = 82.5\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait a minute\u2014$82.50 seems too low for the total gas cost, especially if a single person's share decreased by $11.00. Let's double-check the calculations to ensure there are no mistakes.\n\n### **Checking the Calculation:**\n\n**Revisiting the Equation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{2C}{15} = 11 \\implies C = \\frac{11 \\times 15}{2} = \\frac{165}{2} = 82.5\n\\]\nHmm, mathematically, it's correct, but intuitively, it doesn't make sense. If the total cost were $82.50, the initial cost per person would be \\( \\frac{82.5}{3} = 27.5 \\), and the new cost per person would be \\( \\frac{82.5}{5} = 16.5 \\). The decrease is \\( 27.5 - 16.5 = 11 \\), which matches the problem statement.\n\n**Reflection:**\nPerhaps my initial skepticism was unfounded. The calculations do verify the decrease of $11.00 per person. However, given that the total cost is only $82.50, it's plausible for a short trip or a fuel-efficient vehicle.\n\n### **Alternative Approach for Verification:**\n\nJust to ensure accuracy, let's try another approach.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Cost Per Person Difference Approach**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Decrease for All Three Original Friends**\n\nEach of the original three saved $11.00, so the total savings is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 11 = 33\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Recognize That This Total Decrease Came from the Redistribution**\n\nThe total decrease of $33.00 equals the difference in total cost shared before and after the additional friends joined.\n\n**Step 3: Set Up the Equation**\n\nThe difference in total cost shared among all friends:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{C}{3} - \\frac{C}{5}\\right) \\times 3 = 33\n\\]\nBut we already established:\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{3} - \\frac{C}{5} = 11\n\\]\nSo multiplying by 3 gives:\n\\[\n33 = 33\n\\]\nWhich is consistent.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis alternative approach confirms the previous calculation. The total savings of $33.00 aligns with the decrease per person and the total number of original friends.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies and verifying calculations, the total cost of the gas is indeed **$82.50**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{82.50}\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **Initial Cost per Person:** \\( \\frac{82.5}{3} = 27.5 \\)\n- **New Cost per Person:** \\( \\frac{82.5}{5} = 16.5 \\)\n- **Decrease per Person:** \\( 27.5 - 16.5 = 11 \\)\n\nEverything checks out, so I'm confident that the total gas cost is **$82.50**.",
