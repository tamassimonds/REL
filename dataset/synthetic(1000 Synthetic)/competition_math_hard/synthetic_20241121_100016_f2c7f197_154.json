  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it for the first time. I'll brainstorm different strategies, explore them, check frequently if I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed. Let\u2019s keep it as natural as possible, reflecting my actual thought process.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem is asking to rationalize the denominator of \\(\\frac{5}{2+\\sqrt{6}}\\). Immediately, I recognize that this involves removing the square root from the denominator. I remember doing similar problems before, usually involving multiplying by a conjugate, but let me brainstorm a bit to be sure.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Multiplying by the Conjugate:** This is the first thing that comes to mind\u2014using the conjugate to eliminate the square root.\n  2. **Using Algebraic Identities:** Maybe applying some identity like \\((a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2\\)?\n  3. **Alternative Methods:** Perhaps simplifying \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) in some way, though that feels less straightforward.\n\n**Initial Preference:** I think multiplying by the conjugate is the most straightforward method, but let\u2019s explore it to see if it actually works.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Conjugate Method**\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, before jumping in, let me remind myself what the conjugate is. For a denominator like \\(2 + \\sqrt{6}\\), the conjugate would be \\(2 - \\sqrt{6}\\). Multiplying the numerator and denominator by this should help remove the square root.\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:** Yeah, multiplying by the conjugate usually helps because it turns the denominator into a difference of squares, which gets rid of the square root.\n\n**Proceeding with the Conjugate:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{2+\\sqrt{6}} \\times \\frac{2-\\sqrt{6}}{2-\\sqrt{6}}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Denominator:**\n\nLet\u2019s focus on the denominator first:\n\n\\[\n(2+\\sqrt{6})(2-\\sqrt{6}) = 2^2 - (\\sqrt{6})^2 = 4 - 6 = -2\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute:** Hmm, the denominator turned out to be \\(-2\\). That\u2019s interesting\u2014usually, I expect a positive number, but negative is fine as long as we handle it correctly. Let\u2019s keep going and see how it affects the numerator.\n\n**Checking if This Makes Sense:** Since the denominator is negative, the overall fraction will change signs. I need to ensure that the final expression maintains the original value.\n\n**Proceeding with the Numerator:**\n\nNow, multiply the numerator:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times (2 - \\sqrt{6}) = 10 - 5\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10 - 5\\sqrt{6}}{-2}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\nI can split this fraction into two parts:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{-2} + \\frac{-5\\sqrt{6}}{-2} = -5 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Expressing in the Desired Format:**\n\nThe problem asks for the answer in the form \\(\\frac{A\\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\\). Let\u2019s rearrange:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{2} - 5 = \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{2} + \\frac{-10}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{6} - 10}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, comparing with \\(\\frac{A\\sqrt{B} + C}{D}\\):\n\n- \\(A = 5\\)\n- \\(B = 6\\)\n- \\(C = -10\\)\n- \\(D = 2\\)\n\n**Immediate Check:** Let\u2019s verify if these values satisfy all the conditions:\n\n- \\(D\\) is positive: **Yes, \\(D = 2\\)**\n- \\(B\\) is not divisible by the square of any prime: **Yes, \\(6 = 2 \\times 3\\), and neither 2 nor 3 are squares.**\n- GCD of \\(A\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) is 1: **Let\u2019s check...**\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCD}(5, -10, 2) = 1\n\\]\n\n**Wait, That Can't Be Right:** Actually, the GCD of 5 and 10 is 5, and since 5 and 2 are coprime, the overall GCD is **5**, not 1. This violates one of the conditions.\n\n**Realization:** Oh! This reminds me that I need to simplify the expression further to ensure that the GCD is 1. I missed that step initially.\n\n**Reflecting on the Mistake:** I stopped the simplification too early. I need to factor out the GCD from the numerator to meet the condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Adjusting the Approach**\n\n**New Plan:** I\u2019ll factor out the GCD from the numerator to ensure that \\(A\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) have a GCD of 1.\n\n**Let\u2019s Simplify Again:**\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10 - 5\\sqrt{6}}{-2}\n\\]\n\nFactor out 5 from the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5(2 - \\sqrt{6})}{-2}\n\\]\n\nNow, to make the denominator positive, multiply both the numerator and denominator by \\(-1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-5(2 - \\sqrt{6})}{2} = \\frac{5(\\sqrt{6} - 2)}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Further:**\n\nThis becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5\\sqrt{6} - 10}{2}\n\\]\n\nWhich matches our previous expression, but now let\u2019s ensure the GCD condition is satisfied.\n\n**Checking GCD Again:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCD}(5, -10, 2) = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, to make the GCD 1, I need to factor out the 5 from the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5(\\sqrt{6} - 2)}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, \\(A = 5\\), \\(B = 6\\), \\(C = -10\\), \\(D = 2\\), and the GCD of 5 and 2 is **1**.\n\n**Actually, There Might Be an Easier Way:** Instead of carrying the negative denominator, I could have multiplied both the numerator and denominator by \\(-1\\) earlier to keep things neater. But it\u2019s fine; we\u2019ve arrived at the correct simplification.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Quick Verification:** Let\u2019s quickly verify if the rationalized form is correct by plugging in approximate values.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{2+\\sqrt{6}} \\approx \\frac{5}{4.45} \\approx 1.123\n\\]\n\nRationalized expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5(\\sqrt{6} - 2)}{2} \\approx \\frac{5 \\times (2.45 - 2)}{2} \\approx \\frac{5 \\times 0.45}{2} \\approx \\frac{2.25}{2} \\approx 1.125\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute:** The values are slightly off due to rounding, but they\u2019re close enough to confirm that the rationalization is correct.\n\n**Reflection:** This quick check reassures me that the rationalized form is equivalent to the original expression.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** After adjusting for the GCD condition and simplifying correctly, the rationalized form satisfies all the given conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating \\(A + B + C + D\\)**\n\nFrom the final simplified expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5\\sqrt{6} - 10}{2}\n\\]\n\nWe have:\n\n- \\(A = 5\\)\n- \\(B = 6\\)\n- \\(C = -10\\)\n- \\(D = 2\\)\n\nNow, compute:\n\n\\[\nA + B + C + D = 5 + 6 - 10 + 2 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:** Adding these values again to ensure accuracy:\n\n\\[\n5 + 6 = 11 \\\\\n11 - 10 = 1 \\\\\n1 + 2 = 3\n\\]\n\n**<ANSWER>3</ANSWER>**\n\n**Final Reflection:** Everything checks out. The GCD condition is satisfied, and the rationalized form is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>**\n\n\\(<ANSWER>3</ANSWER>\\)\n\n**Conclusion:** After exploring different strategies, identifying and correcting mistakes, and performing multiple checks, we've successfully rationalized the denominator and determined that \\(A + B + C + D = 3\\).\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:** By approaching the problem methodically, reflecting on each step, and being open to adjusting the strategy as needed, we ensured an accurate and complete solution.",
