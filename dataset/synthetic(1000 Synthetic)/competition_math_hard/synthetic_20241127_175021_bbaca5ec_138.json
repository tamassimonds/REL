  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I'd approach it naturally if I were solving it on paper. I'll let my thoughts flow, brainstorm different strategies, and check my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2^{n+4} - 2(2^n)}{2(2^{n+3})}\n\\]\n\nMy initial reaction is that this looks like a simplification problem involving exponents. I've dealt with similar problems before, so maybe applying exponent rules could help. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to start. Maybe factoring could work? Let's brainstorm some strategies.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Factor Out Common Terms:**  \n   Perhaps I can factor out \\(2^n\\) from the numerator. This might simplify things.\n\n2. **Simplify Exponents:**  \n   Maybe I can rewrite the exponents to make the expression simpler.\n\n3. **Cancel Common Factors:**  \n   After factoring, see if there are common factors in the numerator and denominator that can be canceled.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Factor Out Common Terms**\n\nLet me try factoring out \\(2^n\\) from the numerator.\n\n\\[\n2^{n+4} - 2(2^n) = 2^n \\times 2^4 - 2 \\times 2^n = 2^n (16 - 2)\n\\]\n\nSo, that simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2^n \\times 14\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks promising. By factoring out \\(2^n\\), I've simplified the numerator significantly. Let's move on to the denominator.\n\n### **Simplifying the Denominator**\n\nThe denominator is:\n\n\\[\n2(2^{n+3})\n\\]\n\nI can rewrite this as:\n\n\\[\n2^1 \\times 2^{n+3} = 2^{n+4}\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute...**  \nThat\u2019s interesting! The denominator simplifies to \\(2^{n+4}\\), which is similar to the exponent in the numerator before factoring. This might make canceling easier.\n\n### **Rewriting the Expression**\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14 \\times 2^n}{2^{n+4}}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLooking at this, I think I can simplify it further by canceling out \\(2^n\\) from the numerator and denominator. Let's see if that works.\n\n### **Canceling Common Factors**\n\nIf I divide both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^n\\), I get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14 \\times 2^n}{2^{n+4}} = \\frac{14}{2^{n+4-n}} = \\frac{14}{2^4} = \\frac{14}{16}\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Calculation:**  \n\\[\n2^{n+4-n} = 2^4 = 16\n\\]\n\nSo, the fraction simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14}{16}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems right, but I notice that \\(14\\) and \\(16\\) have a common factor. I should simplify the fraction further.\n\n### **Simplifying the Fraction**\n\nBoth \\(14\\) and \\(16\\) are divisible by 2. Let's divide the numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{14 \\div 2}{16 \\div 2} = \\frac{7}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{7}{8}\\ \\text{is in its simplest form since 7 and 8 have no common factors other than 1.}\n\\]\n\n### **Wait, Let Me Rethink That**\n\nHmm, before finalizing, let me quickly recap the steps to ensure everything makes sense:\n\n1. **Factored \\(2^n\\) from the numerator:**  \n   \\[\n   2^{n+4} - 2(2^n) = 14 \\times 2^n\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplified the denominator:**  \n   \\[\n   2(2^{n+3}) = 2^{n+4}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Canceled \\(2^n\\) from both numerator and denominator:**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{14 \\times 2^n}{2^{n+4}} = \\frac{14}{2^4} = \\frac{14}{16} = \\frac{7}{8}\n   \\]\n\nEverything checks out. The steps are logical, and the simplification is correct.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Simplify Differently**\n\nJust to be sure, let's try a different approach to see if we arrive at the same answer.\n\n**Strategy 2: Combining Exponents Before Factoring**\n\nInstead of factoring right away, let's simplify the numerator by recognizing that:\n\n\\[\n2^{n+4} = 2^n \\times 2^4 = 2^n \\times 16\n\\]\n\nSo, the numerator becomes:\n\n\\[\n2^n \\times 16 - 2 \\times 2^n = 2^n (16 - 2) = 2^n \\times 14\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis is the same result as before, confirming that factoring out \\(2^n\\) was the right move.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nTrying a different strategy led me to the same intermediate step, which reassures me that the original approach is correct.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter simplifying, the expression reduces to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{8}\n\\]\n\n\\(<ANSWER>\\frac{7}{8}</ANSWER>\\)\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, factoring out common terms, and simplifying step by step, I was able to simplify the given expression to \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\). Checking the work along the way ensured that each step was correct, and trying an alternative method helped confirm the accuracy of the solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nWriting out the thought process in detail not only helps in catching any potential mistakes early but also reinforces the understanding of the problem-solving techniques involved. It\u2019s a good practice to verify the solution by considering multiple approaches, especially in mathematical problems like this one.",
