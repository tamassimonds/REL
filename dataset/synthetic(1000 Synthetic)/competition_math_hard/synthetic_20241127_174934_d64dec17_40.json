I'll ensure it reads smoothly, like a complete, well-organized problem-solving journey.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, so **Jackie and Phil** each flip three coins:\n\n- **Two are fair coins** (equal chance for heads or tails).\n- **One coin is biased** with a probability of \\(\\frac{4}{7}\\) for heads.\n\n**Goal:** Find the probability that both Jackie and Phil get the **same number of heads**. Express the final answer in the form \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime. Then, compute \\(m + n\\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**  \nThis is a probability problem involving multiple coin flips with both fair and biased coins. I need to calculate the probability distributions for Jackie and Phil and then determine the probability of matching outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Probabilities for Jackie**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet's begin by determining the probability distribution for the number of heads Jackie gets when flipping her three coins.\n\n**Approach:**  \n- **Two Fair Coins:** Each can be heads with probability \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n- **One Biased Coin:** Comes up heads with probability \\(\\frac{4}{7}\\).\n\nI need to consider all possible combinations of heads and tails across the three coins.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **0 Heads:**  \n   All three coins come up tails.\n   \\[\n   P(0) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{3}{28}\n   \\]\n\n2. **1 Head:**  \n   Three scenarios:\n   - Two fair coins tails, biased coin heads:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\times \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{4}{28} = \\frac{1}{7}\n     \\]\n   - One fair coin heads, one tails, biased coin tails (two ways):\n     \\[\n     2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{3}{7}\\right) = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{6}{28} = \\frac{3}{14}\n     \\]\n   - **Total for 1 Head:**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{3}{14} = \\frac{2}{14} + \\frac{3}{14} = \\frac{5}{14}\n     \\]\n\n3. **2 Heads:**  \n   Two scenarios:\n   - Both fair coins heads, biased coin tails:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{3}{28}\n     \\]\n   - One fair coin heads, one tails, biased coin heads (two ways):\n     \\[\n     2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{7}\\right) = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{8}{28} = \\frac{2}{7}\n     \\]\n   - **Total for 2 Heads:**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{28} + \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{3}{28} + \\frac{8}{28} = \\frac{11}{28}\n     \\]\n\n4. **3 Heads:**  \n   All coins heads:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\times \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{4}{28} = \\frac{1}{7}\n   \\]\n\n**Probability Distribution for Jackie:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nP(0) & = \\frac{3}{28} \\\\\nP(1) & = \\frac{5}{14} = \\frac{10}{28} \\\\\nP(2) & = \\frac{11}{28} \\\\\nP(3) & = \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{4}{28} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{3}{28} + \\frac{10}{28} + \\frac{11}{28} + \\frac{4}{28} = \\frac{28}{28} = 1\n\\]\nThe probabilities sum to 1, confirming that the distribution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Probabilities for Phil**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nPhil's scenario is identical to Jackie's, so his probability distribution will be the same.\n\n**Probability Distribution for Phil:**  \nSame as Jackie:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nP(0) & = \\frac{3}{28} \\\\\nP(1) & = \\frac{5}{14} = \\frac{10}{28} \\\\\nP(2) & = \\frac{11}{28} \\\\\nP(3) & = \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{4}{28} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**  \nThe probabilities again sum to 1, ensuring correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Probability of Matching Heads**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow, I need to find the probability that Jackie and Phil get the **same number of heads**. This involves calculating the probability of their outcomes matching.\n\n**Approach:**  \nList all possible matching scenarios and compute their probabilities:\n\n1. Both get 0 heads.\n2.

Both get 3 heads.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Both Get 0 Heads:**\n   \\[\n   P(0,0) = \\frac{3}{28} \\times \\frac{3}{28} = \\frac{9}{784}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Both Get 1 Head:**\n   \\[\n   P(1,1) = \\frac{10}{28} \\times \\frac{10}{28} = \\frac{100}{784}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Both Get 2 Heads:**\n   \\[\n   P(2,2) = \\frac{11}{28} \\times \\frac{11}{28} = \\frac{121}{784}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Both Get 3 Heads:**\n   \\[\n   P(3,3) = \\frac{4}{28} \\times \\frac{4}{28} = \\frac{16}{784}\n   \\]\n\n**Total Matching Probability:**\n\\[\nP(\\text{Matching}) = \\frac{9}{784} + \\frac{100}{784} + \\frac{121}{784} + \\frac{16}{784} = \\frac{246}{784}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\\[\n\\frac{246}{784} = \\frac{123}{392}\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**  \nCheck if \\(\\frac{123}{392}\\) is in its simplest form by ensuring that 123 and 392 have no common factors:\n\n- **Prime Factors of 123:**  \n  \\(123 = 3 \\times 41\\)\n  \n- **Prime Factors of 392:**  \n  \\(392 = 2^3 \\times 7^2\\)\n  \nSince there are no common factors, \\(\\frac{123}{392}\\) is already simplified.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe final task is to compute \\(m + n\\), where \\(\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{123}{392}\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nm + n = 123 + 392 = 515\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution</ANSWER>**\n\nThrough careful step-by-step calculations and verifying each component, we've determined that the probability of Jackie and Phil getting the same number of heads is \\(\\frac{123}{392}\\). Consequently, \\(m + n = 515\\).\n\n\\(<ANSWER> 515</ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\nBy meticulously calculating the probability distributions for both Jackie and Phil, and then determining the probability of their outcomes matching, we arrived at the final result. Along the way, verifying each step ensured accuracy, leading to the correct solution:  \n\\(<ANSWER> 515</ANSWER>\\)",
  "ground_truth": "This can be solved quickly and easily with generating functions.\nLet $x^n$ represent flipping $n$ tails.\nThe generating functions for these coins are $(1+x)$,$(1+x)$,and $(4+3x)$ in order.\nThe product is $4+11x+10x^2+3x^3$. ($ax^n$ means there are $a$ ways to get $n$ heads, eg there are $10$ ways to get $2$ heads, and therefore $1$ tail, here.)\nThe sum of the coefficients squared (total number of possible outcomes, squared because the event is occurring twice) is $(4 + 11 + 10 + 3)^2 = 28^2 = 784$ and the sum of the squares of each coefficient (the sum of the number of ways that each coefficient can be chosen by the two people) is $4^2 + 11^2 + 10^2 + 3^2=246$. The probability is then $\\frac{4^2 + 11^2 + 10^2 + 3^2}{28^2}  = \\frac{246}{784} = \\frac{123}{392}$. (Notice the relationship between the addends of the numerator here and the cases in the following solution.)\n$123 + 392 = \\boxed{515}$"
