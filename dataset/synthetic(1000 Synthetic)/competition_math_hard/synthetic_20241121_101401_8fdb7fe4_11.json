  "problem": "How many 4-digit positive integers exist that satisfy the following conditions: (A) Each of the first two digits must be 1, 4, or 5, and (B) the last two digits cannot be the same digit, and (C) each of the last two digits must be 5, 7, or 8?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's refine this into a coherent and complete solution, maintaining the same thought process but organizing it more fluidly. I'll ensure it reads naturally while preserving all essential details.\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWhen I first encounter this question, I immediately recognize it as a combinatorics problem involving 4-digit integers with specific digit constraints. The conditions remind me of similar problems where I need to carefully consider the possible combinations while adhering to given restrictions. My initial instinct is to approach it step by step, examining each digit's possibilities, but I'm open to exploring multiple strategies to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Digit-by-Digit Assignment:**  \n   Assign possible values to each digit based on the conditions and multiply the possibilities.\n\n2. **Using Permutations for the Last Two Digits:**  \n   Since the last two digits must be different, perhaps employ permutations to account for this.\n\n3. **Subtracting Invalid Cases:**  \n   Calculate the total combinations without restrictions and then subtract the cases that violate the conditions.\n\nI'm inclined to start with the **Digit-by-Digit Assignment** strategy because it seems straightforward. However, I recognize that the restriction on the last two digits requires careful handling, so I might need to adjust my approach as I proceed.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Assigning Possible Values to Each Digit**\n\n### **Thought Process**\n\nLet's begin by identifying the possible values for each digit according to the conditions:\n\n- **First Digit:** Must be 1, 4, or 5.\n- **Second Digit:** Must be 1, 4, or 5.\n- **Third Digit:** Must be 5, 7, or 8.\n- **Fourth Digit:** Must be 5, 7, or 8 and **cannot be the same as the third digit**.\n\nAt first glance, this seems manageable. I can calculate the number of combinations for the first two digits and then handle the restrictions on the last two digits separately.\n\n### **Calculations**\n\n1. **First Two Digits:**  \n   Each digit has 3 possible choices: 1, 4, or 5.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total combinations for the first two digits} = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n    - **Reflection Moment:**  \n      This part is straightforward\u20149 combinations for the first two digits make sense.\n\n2. **Last Two Digits:**  \n   Here\u2019s where it gets tricky. The third and fourth digits have 3 possibilities each, but the fourth digit cannot be the same as the third.\n   \n    - **Initial Calculation:**  \n      \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) total combinations without restrictions.\n      \n    - **Reflection Moment:**  \n      Wait a minute\u2014if I proceed this way, I'll overcount cases where the third and fourth digits are the same. I need to adjust for that.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Calculating Valid Combinations for the Last Two Digits**\n\n### **Thought Process**\n\nTo handle the restriction that the last two digits cannot be the same, I have two options:\n\n1. **Total Minus Invalid:**  \n   Calculate all possible combinations and subtract the ones where the last two digits are identical.\n\n2. **Direct Counting of Valid Combinations:**  \n   For each choice of the third digit, count the number of valid choices for the fourth digit.\n\nI'm leaning towards the **Direct Counting of Valid Combinations** approach because it seems more intuitive and straightforward for this problem.\n\n### **Calculations**\n\n1. **Total Combinations for Last Two Digits Without Restrictions:**  \n   \n   \\[\n   3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Invalid Combinations (Where Last Two Digits Are the Same):**  \n   There are 3 cases where the third and fourth digits are the same: (5,5), (7,7), (8,8).\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Invalid Combinations} = 3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Valid Combinations:**  \n   \n   \\[\n   9 - 3 = 6\n   \\]\n\n    - **Quick Check:**  \n      Does this make sense? Yes, removing the 3 invalid cases from the 9 total combinations leaves us with 6 valid combinations where the last two digits are different.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Calculating the Total Number of Valid 4-Digit Numbers**\n\n### **Thought Process**\n\nNow that I have the number of valid combinations for both the first two digits and the last two digits, I can multiply them to get the total number of valid 4-digit numbers. This is akin to creating a grid where each combination of the first two digits pairs with each valid combination of the last two digits.\n\n### **Calculations**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Valid 4-Digit Numbers} = \\text{First Two Digits Combinations} \\times \\text{Valid Last Two Digits Combinations} = 9 \\times 6 = 54\n\\]\n\n    - **Reflection Moment:**  \n      Does this result make sense? At first, 54 seems reasonable given the restrictions, but I want to ensure no conditions were overlooked.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n### **Thought Process**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, it's essential to verify that all conditions are correctly accounted for. I'll review each step to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n### **Checking Each Condition**\n\n1. **Condition A:**  \n   Each of the first two digits must be 1, 4, or 5.\n   \n   - **Handled:** Yes, we calculated \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) combinations.\n\n2. **Condition B:**  \n   The last two digits cannot be the same digit.\n   \n   - **Handled:** Yes, we subtracted the 3 invalid cases from the total.\n\n3. **Condition C:**  \n   Each of the last two digits must be 5, 7, or 8.\n   \n   - **Handled:** Yes, all valid combinations adhere to this.\n\n### **Additional Check**\n\nLet\u2019s list a few examples to see if the calculations hold up:\n\n- **First Two Digits: 11**  \n  - Last Two Digits: 57, 58, 75, 78, 85, 87  \n  - Total: 6 valid combinations\n\n- **First Two Digits: 14**  \n  - Last Two Digits: 57, 58, 75, 78, 85, 87  \n  - Total: 6 valid combinations\n\nThis pattern repeats for all 9 combinations of the first two digits, confirming that multiplying \\(9 \\times 6\\) is correct.\n\n    - **Reflection Moment:**  \n      Listing examples helps solidify that the approach is correct. It reassures me that all conditions are met, and the total count is accurate.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully breaking down the problem, considering different strategies, and verifying each step, the total number of valid 4-digit positive integers is:\n\n\\(<ANSWER> 54 </ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically\u2014starting with brainstorming, exploring different strategies, and constantly checking for accuracy\u2014I ensured that all conditions were met and arrived at the correct solution. Writing out the thought process, including reflections and verifications, not only helps in solving the problem but also in confirming that the solution is valid.\n\n---\n\nThere we go! I maintained the original thought process while streamlining the narrative to make it more coherent and complete.",
  "ground_truth": "The first two digits may be any of 3, so there are $3^2 = 9$ choices for the first two. There are $3\\times 2$ possible values for the last two, since we have 3 choices for the first and then 2 for the second, so there are $9\\times 6 = \\boxed{54}$ possible integers."
