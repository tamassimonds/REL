  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, complete with brainstorming, checking my work, and rethinking strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we have a monic polynomial \\( f(x) \\) of degree 2. I know that monic means the leading coefficient is 1. The problem gives us two conditions: \\( f(0) = 4 \\) and \\( f(1) = 10 \\). Our goal is to find \\( f(x) \\) in the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- This reminds me of quadratic polynomials. Since it's monic, the \\( a \\) coefficient should be 1.\n- I could set up the polynomial as \\( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c \\) and use the given points to solve for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n- Alternatively, I could think about using the vertex form or factoring, but given the information, starting with the standard form seems most straightforward.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI'll start by assuming \\( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c \\) since it's monic. Then, I'll plug in the given points to create equations and solve for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n### **Step 1: Set Up the Polynomial**\n\nGiven that the polynomial is monic and of degree 2, I can write it as:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + bx + c\n\\]\n\nWait, but I'm given \\( f(0) = 4 \\). Let me plug that in to see what happens.\n\n\\[\nf(0) = 0^2 + b(0) + c = c = 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOh, that's straightforward. So, \\( c = 4 \\). That makes sense because the constant term is the value of the polynomial at \\( x = 0 \\).\n\n**Update Polynomial:**\n\nNow, I can update the polynomial:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + bx + 4\n\\]\n\n### **Step 2: Use the Second Condition \\( f(1) = 10 \\)**\n\nNext, I'll use the second condition \\( f(1) = 10 \\) to solve for \\( b \\).\n\n\\[\nf(1) = 1^2 + b(1) + 4 = 1 + b + 4 = 5 + b = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, I can solve for \\( b \\) here.\n\n\\[\n5 + b = 10 \\implies b = 10 - 5 = 5\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct. Let me do a quick check: If \\( b = 5 \\), then at \\( x = 1 \\), the polynomial should equal 10. Plugging it back in:\n\n\\[\n1^2 + 5(1) + 4 = 1 + 5 + 4 = 10\n\\]\n\nYes, that works!\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. If I already know \\( c = 4 \\) and \\( b = 5 \\), I can write the polynomial as:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4\n\\]\n\nBut maybe there's another way to verify this.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\nI always like to double-check my work to ensure everything is correct.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\nLet me consider writing the polynomial in factored form to see if it matches.\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2) \\), but since it's monic and quadratic, expanding gives:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1r_2\n\\]\n\nComparing this with \\( f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4 \\):\n\n\\[\n-(r_1 + r_2) = 5 \\implies r_1 + r_2 = -5\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1r_2 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Solving for Roots:**\n\nI can find the roots using these equations:\n\n\\[\nr_1 = \\frac{-5 + \\sqrt{25 - 16}}{2} = \\frac{-5 + 3}{2} = -1\n\\]\n\\[\nr_2 = \\frac{-5 - \\sqrt{25 - 16}}{2} = \\frac{-5 - 3}{2} = -4\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\nSo, the factored form is:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = (x + 1)(x + 4)\n\\]\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4\n\\]\n\nThis matches our original polynomial. Everything checks out!\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\n\\[\n\\text{The polynomial is } f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4.\n\\]\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming and trying different strategies, I settled on using the standard form of a monic quadratic polynomial. By applying the given conditions, I solved for the coefficients successfully. A quick verification using factored form confirmed that the solution is correct.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- Starting with the standard form made it easy to apply the given conditions.\n- Verifying the solution using an alternative method (factored form) ensured correctness.\n- Checking each step helped catch any potential errors early on.\n\nOverall, approaching the problem methodically and being open to adjusting strategies led to an accurate and reliable solution.",
  "ground_truth": "Since $f(x)$ has degree $2$, we know it is of the form $ax^2+bx+c$. A monic polynomial is one whose leading coefficient is $1$, so $a=1$. Since $f(0)=4$, we know $1(0)^2+b(0)+c=4$, so $c=4$. Since $f(1)=10$, we know $1(1)^2+b(1)+4=10$, so $b+5=10$ and $b=5$. Thus $f(x)=\\boxed{x^2+5x+4}$."
