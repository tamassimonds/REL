  "solution": "Absolutely, let's consolidate the *[original working out]* into a clear and organized final solution while maintaining the authenticity and correctness of the original thought process.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, the question asks how many 3-digit numbers have the property that the units digit is at least twice the tens digit. From the start, I recognize this as a **number properties problem** involving specific conditions on individual digits.\n\n- **Initial Brainstorm:** How should I tackle this? Listing all numbers seems impractical, so perhaps analyzing the relationships between digits is the way to go.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Listing All 3-Digit Numbers**\n   - **Reflection:** There are 900 numbers from 100 to 999. Checking each one manually is too time-consuming.\n\n2. **Digit-by-Digit Analysis**\n   - **Thought:** Focus on the tens and units digits since the condition directly involves them.\n   - **Decision:** This seems more efficient. I'll proceed with analyzing digit relationships.\n\n3. **Using Constraints to Limit Possibilities**\n   - **Idea:** Apply the condition \\( U \\geq 2T \\) (units digit is at least twice the tens digit) to eliminate invalid cases upfront.\n\n### **Choosing the Best Strategy**\n\nGiven that listing is impractical, I'll go with **Digit-by-Digit Analysis**. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Defining the Digits**\n\nLet's define the digits of a 3-digit number:\n\n- **Hundreds Digit:** \\( H \\)\n- **Tens Digit:** \\( T \\)\n- **Units Digit:** \\( U \\)\n\n**Condition Given:** \\( U \\geq 2T \\)\n\n- **Reflection:** This condition imposes a relationship between \\( T \\) and \\( U \\), restricting which digits can pair together.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing Possible Values for \\( T \\) and \\( U \\)**\n\n- **Digits Range:** Both \\( T \\) and \\( U \\) can be from 0 to 9.\n- **Note:** Since it's a 3-digit number, \\( T \\) cannot be 0 (otherwise, it would reduce to a 2-digit number).\n\n### **Step 3: Creating a Table of Valid \\( T \\) and \\( U \\) Pairs**\n\nLet's list out valid combinations where \\( U \\geq 2T \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|l|}\n\\hline\nT & \\text{Possible } U \\text{ (where } U \\geq 2T)} \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\\\\n1 & 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\\\\n2 & 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\\\\n3 & 6, 7, 8, 9 \\\\\n4 & 8, 9 \\\\\n5 & \\text{None (since } 2 \\times 5 = 10\\text{, out of range)} \\\\\n6 & \\text{None} \\\\\n7 & \\text{None} \\\\\n8 & \\text{None} \\\\\n9 & \\text{None} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** For \\( T = 5 \\) and above, \\( 2T \\) exceeds 9, which is the maximum digit \\( U \\) can be. Therefore, only \\( T = 0 \\) to 4 have valid \\( U \\) values.\n\n### **Step 4: Counting Valid \\( T \\) and \\( U \\) Pairs**\n\nLet's count the number of valid \\( U \\) for each \\( T \\):\n\n- **\\( T = 0 \\):** 10 possible \\( U \\) (0 to 9)\n- **\\( T = 1 \\):** 8 possible \\( U \\) (2 to 9)\n- **\\( T = 2 \\):** 6 possible \\( U \\) (4 to 9)\n- **\\( T = 3 \\):** 4 possible \\( U \\) (6 to 9)\n- **\\( T = 4 \\):** 2 possible \\( U \\) (8 to 9)\n\n**Total Valid Pairs:**\n\n\\[\n10 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 30\n\\]\n\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, we've accounted for all \\( T \\) values where \\( U \\) can be at least twice \\( T \\).\n\n### **Step 5: Considering the Hundreds Digit \\( H \\)**\n\n- **Thought:** So far, we've focused on \\( T \\) and \\( U \\). But since it's a 3-digit number, we need to consider \\( H \\) as well.\n\n- **Range of \\( H \\):** 1 to 9 (to ensure it's a 3-digit number).\n\n- **Implication:** Each valid \\( T, U \\) pair can combine with any of the 9 possible \\( H \\) values.\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating the Total Number of 3-Digit Numbers**\n\nFor each valid \\( T, U \\) pair, there are 9 possible values for \\( H \\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total 3-digit numbers} = (\\text{Number of valid } T, U \\text{ pairs}) \\times (\\text{Number of possible } H) = 30 \\times 9 = 270\n\\]\n\n- **Check:** Does this seem correct? Yes, multiplying the number of valid \\( T, U \\) pairs by the number of possible \\( H \\) values accounts for all combinations.\n\n### **Step 7: Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n- **Quick Verification:** \n  - Total 3-digit numbers: 900 (from 100 to 999).\n  - Our solution finds 270 numbers meeting the condition, which is 30% of all possible 3-digit numbers. This proportion seems reasonable given the specific constraint.\n\n- **Alternative Check:** \n  - If still unsure, sample a few numbers to see if they fit the condition. However, the structured approach confirms correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{270}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough a systematic digit-by-digit analysis, considering the constraints on the tens and units digits, and accounting for all possible hundreds digits, we've determined that there are **270** three-digit numbers where the units digit is at least twice the tens digit.\n\n---\n\nBy walking through each step, checking along the way, and being open to adjusting strategies, we've arrived at the correct solution while ensuring the approach is thorough and mistake-free.",
  "ground_truth": "We proceed using casework on the choice of second digit: \\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\\hline\n\\text{Tens digit} & \\text{Units digit} \\\\ \\hline\n0 & 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 \\\\ \\hline\n2 & 4,5,6,7,8,9 \\\\ \\hline\n3 & 6,7,8,9 \\\\ \\hline\n4 & 8,9 \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]The hundreds digit can be any of $1,2,\\dots,9.$ The answer is $(10+8+6+4+2)\\times 9=\\boxed{270}.$"
