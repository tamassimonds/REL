  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this again, keeping my original insights but being more open to adjusting my strategies when things don't seem right. I'll walk through my thought process step by step, reflecting and correcting along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, I need to evaluate the infinite sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{n^4 + 4}\n\\]\n\nAt first glance, this looks like a series where both the numerator and denominator depend on \\( n \\). It reminds me of problems involving **telescoping series** or **partial fraction decomposition**, but I'm not entirely sure which approach will work best here.\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Brainstorming**\n\n- **Partial Fraction Decomposition:** Maybe I can break down \\( \\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} \\) into simpler fractions.\n- **Telescoping Series:** If terms cancel out, it could simplify the sum significantly.\n- **Recognizing Patterns:** Perhaps there's a known series or formula that matches this.\n- **Convergence Tests:** Determine if the series converges to ensure summing it makes sense.\n\nHonestly, I'm not certain which method will be the most effective. Let's explore each one briefly to see which might lead us in the right direction.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\n#### **Step 1: Attempt Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\nLet's try to decompose \\( \\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} \\) into simpler fractions. Usually, this works well for rational functions.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The denominator \\( n^4 + 4 \\) looks like it might be factorable, which is necessary for partial fraction decomposition.\n- If I can factor the denominator, I can express the fraction as a sum of simpler fractions.\n\n**Action:**\nFirst, attempt to factor \\( n^4 + 4 \\).\n\nWait a minute... factoring quartic polynomials isn't always straightforward. Let me recall if \\( n^4 + 4 \\) can be factored easily.\n\nActually, looking at this again, I remember that:\n\n\\[\nn^4 + 4 = (n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, that seems right. So, I can attempt to decompose the fraction using these factors.\n\n**Writing the Decomposition:**\nI want to write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} = \\frac{An + B}{n^2 + 2n + 2} + \\frac{Cn + D}{n^2 - 2n + 2}\n\\]\n\n**Solving for Coefficients:**\nMultiply both sides by \\( n^4 + 4 \\) to clear the denominators:\n\n\\[\nn = (An + B)(n^2 - 2n + 2) + (Cn + D)(n^2 + 2n + 2)\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\nWow, this is getting messy. I need to expand both terms and collect like coefficients to solve for \\( A, B, C, \\), and \\( D \\).\n\n**Checking if This is Worthwhile:**\nLet me think... this might take a lot of time, and I'm not even sure if it will lead to a neat telescoping series. Perhaps there's a better way.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMaybe partial fraction decomposition isn't the most efficient path here. I'll keep it as a backup but explore other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Telescoping Series**\n\n#### **Step 2: Look for a Telescoping Series**\n\nA telescoping series is one where consecutive terms cancel each other out, simplifying the sum significantly.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf I can express \\( \\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} \\) in a way that terms cancel out, the infinite sum might become manageable.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's see if I can rewrite the fraction to reveal such a pattern.\n\nHmm... I'm not immediately seeing how to do this. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis approach isn't leading me anywhere right now. Perhaps I need to try a different angle.\n\n---\n\n### **Recognizing Patterns or Known Series**\n\n#### **Step 3: Identifying Known Series**\n\nMaybe this series resembles a known convergent series with a calculable sum.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nDoes this series remind me of any standard series? Harmonic series, geometric series, or perhaps something involving polynomials?\n\n**Action:**\nThinking through standard series... but nothing is clicking. This series doesn\u2019t seem to match any of the straightforward ones I know.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis isn\u2019t helpful either. Time to brainstorm again.\n\n---\n\n### **Considering Convergence Tests**\n\n#### **Step 4: Check for Convergence**\n\nBefore proceeding, it's good to know if the series converges. If it doesn't, attempting to find a sum would be futile.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI can use the **Comparison Test** or **Limit Comparison Test** to determine convergence.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's compare \\( \\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} \\) with a known convergent series.\n\nNotice that for all \\( n \\geq 1 \\):\n\n\\[\nn^4 + 4 \\geq n^4\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} \\leq \\frac{n}{n^4} = \\frac{1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSince \\( \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3} \\) is a **p-series** with \\( p = 3 > 1 \\), it converges. Therefore, by the Comparison Test, our original series also converges.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGreat! At least we know the series converges. But we still need to find its sum.\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting Partial Fraction Decomposition with a New Approach**\n\n#### **Step 5: Refining Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\nMaybe I need to adjust my partial fraction decomposition approach to make it work.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nPerhaps instead of decomposing into two fractions, I can try a different transformation that simplifies the sum.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's revisit the decomposition but think differently. Instead of decomposing into linear terms, maybe integrating or differentiating could help.\n\nWait, I remember a strategy where differentiating a known series can help find sums involving \\( n \\) in the numerator.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis reminds me of using the **Arctangent Function**. Let me explore this idea.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Utilizing the Arctangent Function**\n\n#### **Step 6: Leveraging the Arctangent Function**\n\nRecall that the derivative of the arctangent function involves expressions similar to our denominator.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe derivative of \\( \\arctan(x) \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{1 + x^2} \\). Our denominator is \\( n^4 + 4 \\), which resembles \\( 1 + (x^2)^2 \\) when \\( x = n \\).\n\n**Action:**\nLet's see if we can relate our series to the arctangent function.\n\nWait, actually, this approach doesn\u2019t seem to align perfectly. The connection is too weak to be useful.\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, perhaps this isn't the right path either. I need to think of another way.\n\n---\n\n### **Engaging in Pattern Recognition Again**\n\n#### **Step 7: Looking for Patterns in the Series**\n\nMaybe examining the first few terms can reveal a pattern or suggest a better approach.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nCalculating the first few terms might help me see if the series behaves in a specific way or if there\u2019s a pattern I can exploit.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's compute the first few terms:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{For } n = 1: & \\quad \\frac{1}{1^4 + 4} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \\\\\n\\text{For } n = 2: & \\quad \\frac{2}{2^4 + 4} = \\frac{2}{20} = 0.1 \\\\\n\\text{For } n = 3: & \\quad \\frac{3}{3^4 + 4} = \\frac{3}{85} \\approx 0.0353 \\\\\n\\text{For } n = 4: & \\quad \\frac{4}{4^4 + 4} = \\frac{4}{260} = 0.0154 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe terms are decreasing rapidly, which is consistent with convergence. However, I don\u2019t see an obvious pattern that would help me sum the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCalculating individual terms isn\u2019t providing new insights. I need to persist with finding a better analytical approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-exploring Partial Fraction Decomposition with Success**\n\n#### **Step 8: Successfully Applying Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\nLet's return to partial fraction decomposition but approach it more carefully this time.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nMaybe I was on the right track initially but got discouraged by the complexity. I should proceed step by step to see if it actually leads to a solution.\n\n**Action:**\nGiven that:\n\n\\[\nn^4 + 4 = (n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)\n\\]\n\nLet's attempt to decompose:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} = \\frac{An + B}{n^2 + 2n + 2} + \\frac{Cn + D}{n^2 - 2n + 2}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( n^4 + 4 \\) to clear denominators:\n\n\\[\nn = (An + B)(n^2 - 2n + 2) + (Cn + D)(n^2 + 2n + 2)\n\\]\n\n**Expanding Both Terms:**\n\\[\nn = (An^3 - 2An^2 + 2An + Bn^2 - 2Bn + 2B) + (Cn^3 + 2Cn^2 + 2Cn + Dn^2 + 2Dn + 2D)\n\\]\n\n**Collecting Like Terms:**\n\\[\nn = (A + C)n^3 + (-2A + B + 2C + D)n^2 + (2A - 2B + 2C + 2D)n + (2B + 2D)\n\\]\n\n**Equating Coefficients:**\nSince the left-hand side is just \\( n \\), all other coefficients must be zero:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1. & \\quad A + C = 0 \\\\\n2. & \\quad -2A + B + 2C + D = 0 \\\\\n3. & \\quad 2A - 2B + 2C + 2D = 1 \\quad (\\text{coefficient of } n) \\\\\n4. & \\quad 2B + 2D = 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Solving the System of Equations:**\nFrom equation 1: \\( C = -A \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( C = -A \\) into equations 2, 3, and 4:\n\nEquation 4: \\( 2B + 2D = 0 \\) \u21d2 \\( B = -D \\)\n\nNow substitute \\( C = -A \\) and \\( B = -D \\) into equation 2:\n\n\\[\n-2A + (-D) + 2(-A) + D = 0 \\\\\n-2A - D - 2A + D = 0 \\\\\n-4A = 0 \\\\\nA = 0\n\\]\n\nFrom \\( A = 0 \\), equation 1 gives \\( C = 0 \\).\n\nWith \\( A = 0 \\) and \\( C = 0 \\), equation 3 becomes:\n\n\\[\n2(0) - 2B + 2(0) + 2D = 1 \\\\\n-2B + 2D = 1 \\\\\n-2D + 2D = 1 \\\\\n0 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOh wait, I've made an error somewhere because this leads to an impossible equation. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\n**Checking Work:**\nHmm, looking back, I see that I misapplied the coefficients. Let's rethink the decomposition. Perhaps a different approach is needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Attempting a Different Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\n#### **Step 9: Adjusting Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\nMaybe decomposing into simpler fractions was too ambitious. Let's try a different type of decomposition.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nInstead of decomposing into two fractions with linear numerators, perhaps a simpler decomposition can work.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's try:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} = \\frac{1}{n^3} - \\frac{4}{n(n^4 + 4)}\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\nLet's verify if this decomposition is correct by combining the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n^3} - \\frac{4}{n(n^4 + 4)} = \\frac{n^4 + 4 - 4}{n^3 (n^4 + 4)} = \\frac{n^4}{n^3 (n^4 + 4)} = \\frac{n}{n^4 + 4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nGreat! The decomposition is correct. This might actually help us sum the series.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with the Decomposition**\n\n#### **Step 10: Applying the Decomposition to the Series**\n\nNow, let's apply this decomposition to the entire series:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{n^3} - \\frac{4}{n(n^4 + 4)} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThis breaks the original series into two separate series:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3} - 4 \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n(n^4 + 4)}\n\\]\n\nThe first series is a known **p-series** with \\( p = 3 \\), which converges. The challenge now is to handle the second series.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's focus on the second series:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{4}{n(n^4 + 4)}\n\\]\n\nI'll need to find a way to sum this series or relate it to a known convergent series.\n\n---\n\n### **Looking for a Telescoping Pattern**\n\n#### **Step 11: Attempting to Find a Telescoping Series**\n\nMaybe the second series can be transformed into a telescoping series where terms cancel out.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf I can express \\( \\frac{4}{n(n^4 + 4)} \\) in a way that consecutive terms cancel each other, the sum would simplify.\n\n**Action:**\nLet me try to decompose \\( \\frac{4}{n(n^4 + 4)} \\) into fractions whose sums telescope.\n\nHmm... but thinking through it, I'm not sure how to proceed with this decomposition. It's not immediately obvious how to make terms cancel.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis approach isn't bearing fruit. I might need to think differently.\n\n---\n\n### **Reassessing the Strategy**\n\n#### **Step 12: Considering Series Transformations**\n\nPerhaps transforming the series using substitution could help.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBy substituting \\( n \\) with a function of another variable, the series might simplify.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's try substituting \\( n \\) with \\( k \\) in terms of another variable, but honestly, I'm not seeing how this would help right now.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis isn't leading anywhere. I need to persist with finding a different method.\n\n---\n\n### **Returning to Partial Fraction Decomposition with a New Insight**\n\n#### **Step 13: Reconsidering Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\nMaybe I can attempt partial fraction decomposition differently to handle the second series.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf I can decompose \\( \\frac{4}{n(n^4 + 4)} \\) into simpler fractions, perhaps the series can be summed more easily.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's attempt to decompose:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{n(n^4 + 4)} = \\frac{4}{n(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)}\n\\]\n\nThis looks complicated... but maybe it's necessary.\n\n**Reflection:**\nPartial fraction decomposition can be messy, but if it leads to a telescoping series, it might be worth it.\n\n**Proceeding with Decomposition:**\nLet's write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{n(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)} = \\frac{A}{n} + \\frac{Bn + C}{n^2 + 2n + 2} + \\frac{Dn + E}{n^2 - 2n + 2}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\nWait... this is getting very complicated. Solving for all these coefficients might take a lot of time and might not even lead to a neat solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPerhaps partial fraction decomposition isn't the most efficient path after all. I need to brainstorm again.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming for a Better Approach**\n\n#### **Step 14: Thinking Outside the Box**\n\nMaybe there's a smarter way to tackle this series that I haven't considered yet.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet me think about series transformations or identifying patterns that could simplify the sum.\n\nPerhaps considering the asymptotic behavior of the series could help in approximating the sum.\n\n**Action:**\nBut wait, the problem asks for the exact sum, so approximations might not be acceptable.\n\n**Reflection:**\nI need to find a method that leads to the exact sum of the series.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Recognizing a Clever Trick**\n\n#### **Step 15: Identifying a Clever Transformation**\n\nWait a minute... what if I multiply and divide by something that simplifies the denominator?\n\n**Thought Process:**\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by a specific term could simplify the expression, making the series easier to sum.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's multiply the numerator and denominator by \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} = \\frac{n \\cdot n}{n^4 + 4} = \\frac{n^2}{n^4 + 4}\n\\]\n\nBut, wait... this doesn't simplify the series. I need to think differently.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis isn't helping. Let's brainstorm again.\n\n---\n\n### **Persisting with Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\n#### **Step 16: Persisting with Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\nGiven that other strategies aren't working, let's persist with partial fraction decomposition, but this time adopting a more patient and systematic approach.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nPerhaps decomposing \\( \\frac{4}{n(n^4 + 4)} \\) into simpler fractions is indeed the right path, even though it seems complex.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{n(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)} = \\frac{A}{n} + \\frac{Bn + C}{n^2 + 2n + 2} + \\frac{Dn + E}{n^2 - 2n + 2}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( n(n^4 + 4) \\) to clear denominators:\n\n\\[\n4 = A(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2) + (Bn + C)n(n^2 - 2n + 2) + (Dn + E)n(n^2 + 2n + 2)\n\\]\n\n**Expanding Both Terms:**\nExpand each term and collect like coefficients:\n\n\\[\n4 = A(n^4 - 4n^2 + 4) + (Bn^4 - 2Bn^3 + 2Bn^2 + Cn^3 - 2Cn^2 + 2Cn) + (Dn^4 + 2Dn^3 + 2Dn^2 + En^3 + 2En^2 + 2En)\n\\]\n\nCollecting like terms:\n\n\\[\n4 = (A + B + D)n^4 + (-2B + C + 2D + E)n^3 + (2B - 2C + 2D + 2E - 4A)n^2 + (2C + 2E)n + 4A\n\\]\n\n**Setting Coefficients Equal:**\nSince the left side is just \\( 4 \\), all coefficients of \\( n \\) must be zero except for the constant term:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1. & \\quad A + B + D = 0 \\\\\n2. & \\quad -2B + C + 2D + E = 0 \\\\\n3. & \\quad 2B - 2C + 2D + 2E - 4A = 0 \\\\\n4. & \\quad 2C + 2E = 0 \\\\\n5. & \\quad 4A = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad A = 1 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Solving for Other Coefficients:**\nFrom \\( 4A = 4 \\), we have \\( A = 1 \\).\n\n**Equation 4:**\n\\[\n2C + 2E = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad C + E = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad C = -E\n\\]\n\n**Equation 1:**\n\\[\nA + B + D = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 1 + B + D = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad B + D = -1\n\\]\n\n**Equation 2:**\n\\[\n-2B + C + 2D + E = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -2B + (-E) + 2D + E = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -2B + 2D = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad D = B\n\\]\n\n**Equation 3:**\n\\[\n2B - 2C + 2D + 2E - 4A = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 2B - 2(-E) + 2B + 2E - 4 = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 4B + 4E - 4 = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad B + E = 1\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Back:**\nFrom \\( B + E = 1 \\) and \\( C = -E \\), and \\( D = B \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nB + E & = 1 \\\\\nC & = -E \\\\\nD & = B \\\\\nB + D & = -1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad B + B = -1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad B = -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\nB & = -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\nB + E & = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -\\frac{1}{2} + E = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad E = \\frac{3}{2} \\\\\nC & = -E = -\\frac{3}{2} \\\\\nD & = B = -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Final Coefficients:**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nA & = 1 \\\\\nB & = -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\nC & = -\\frac{3}{2} \\\\\nD & = -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\nE & = \\frac{3}{2} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nNow that we have the coefficients, we can write the partial fraction decomposition:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{n(n^4 + 4)} = \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}n + \\frac{3}{2}}{n^2 + 2n + 2} - \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}n - \\frac{3}{2}}{n^2 - 2n + 2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{n(n^4 + 4)} = \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{n + 3}{n^2 + 2n + 2} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{n - 3}{n^2 - 2n + 2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPartial fraction decomposition is valid, and I can now express the original series in terms of simpler series.\n\n---\n\n### **Substituting Back into the Original Series**\n\n#### **Step 17: Writing the Series with Decomposed Terms**\n\nLet's substitute the decomposed terms back into the original series.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBy expressing \\( \\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} \\) in terms of simpler fractions, the series might become telescoping or at least easier to sum.\n\n**Action:**\nGiven the partial fraction decomposition:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} = \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{n + 3}{n^2 + 2n + 2} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{n - 3}{n^2 - 2n + 2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back into the series:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{n^3} - \\left( \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{n + 3}{n^2 + 2n + 2} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{n - 3}{n^2 - 2n + 2} \\right) \\right) \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n= \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3} - \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{n + 3}{n^2 + 2n + 2} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{n - 3}{n^2 - 2n + 2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis still doesn\u2019t lead to an obvious telescoping pattern. Perhaps partial fraction decomposition isn\u2019t the right approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPartial fraction decomposition isn\u2019t simplifying the series as expected. I need to explore alternative strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Developing a More Efficient Strategy: Recognizing a Pattern**\n\n#### **Step 18: Rewriting the Original Series**\n\nWait a minute... instead of relying entirely on partial fraction decomposition, perhaps there's a more straightforward way to approach this series by rewriting the original series differently.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBy manipulating the original series, I might be able to identify a pattern or a telescoping nature that simplifies the summation process.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's rewrite the original series as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)}\n\\]\n\n**Factoring the Denominator:**\nLooking at the denominator, I can factor \\( n^4 + 4 \\) as:\n\n\\[\nn^4 + 4 = (n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)\n\\]\n\n**Introducing a Clever Trick:**\nI notice that:\n\n\\[\n(n^2 + 2n + 2) - (n^2 - 2n + 2) = 4n\n\\]\n\n**Alternative Decomposition:**\nThis suggests that I can rewrite the fraction as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{4n}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{(n^2 + 2n + 2) - (n^2 - 2n + 2)}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)}\\]\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Expression:**\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2 - 2n + 2} - \\frac{1}{n^2 + 2n + 2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Back into the Series:**\nSubstituting this back into the original series:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2 - 2n + 2} - \\frac{1}{n^2 + 2n + 2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis transformation is promising because it resembles a **telescoping series**, where many terms cancel out. Let's see how this plays out.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with the Telescoping Series**\n\n#### **Step 19: Evaluating the Telescoping Series**\n\nThe transformed series is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2 - 2n + 2} - \\frac{1}{n^2 + 2n + 2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThis looks like a telescoping series, where consecutive terms cancel each other out, leaving only a few terms that contribute to the sum.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's write out the first few terms to see the cancellation pattern.\n\n**Writing the First Few Terms:**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nn = 1: & \\quad \\frac{1}{1^2 - 2 \\cdot 1 + 2} - \\frac{1}{1^2 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 2} = \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{5} = 1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5} \\\\\nn = 2: & \\quad \\frac{1}{2^2 - 2 \\cdot 2 + 2} - \\frac{1}{2^2 + 2 \\cdot 2 + 2} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{6}{12} - \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{5}{12} \\\\\nn = 3: & \\quad \\frac{1}{3^2 - 2 \\cdot 3 + 2} - \\frac{1}{3^2 + 2 \\cdot 3 + 2} = \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{23} = \\frac{23}{115} - \\frac{5}{115} = \\frac{18}{115} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Observing the Pattern:**\nI see that each negative term from a previous fraction cancels with a positive term from a subsequent fraction. This telescoping nature means that most terms cancel out, leaving only a few terms that contribute to the final sum.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis is exactly what I was hoping for! The series telescopes, which significantly simplifies the summation process.\n\n---\n\n### **Finalizing the Telescoping Sum**\n\n#### **Step 20: Identifying the Remaining Terms**\n\nAfter observing the cancellation pattern, let's identify which terms remain after telescoping.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIn a telescoping series, most intermediate terms cancel out, leaving only the initial and final terms. However, since this is an infinite series, the final terms tend toward zero, leaving only the initial terms contributing to the sum.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's write out the general form of the remaining terms:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{0^2 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1^2 + 1} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nBy recognizing the telescoping pattern and identifying the remaining terms, I've arrived at the final sum of the series.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe infinite sum converges to \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nAfter exploring various strategies, including partial fraction decomposition and recognizing patterns, I initially struggled to find a straightforward solution. However, by persisting and reflecting on different approaches, I eventually identified a telescoping series transformation that simplified the original series, leading to the exact sum of \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\).\n\nThroughout this process, I remained open to adjusting my strategies, recognizing and correcting errors, and validating my new approach by trying different methods. This human-like problem-solving approach, complete with brainstorming, trial and error, and ongoing reflection, enabled me to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBy being flexible in my approach and recognizing when a particular strategy wasn't working, I was able to identify a more efficient method to solve the problem. This iterative process of testing, reflecting, and adjusting ultimately led me to the correct answer.",
