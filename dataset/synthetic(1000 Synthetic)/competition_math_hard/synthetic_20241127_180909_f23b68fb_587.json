  "problem": "What is $3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\pmod{25}$? Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $24$, inclusive.",
  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's weave the detailed thought process into a cohesive, natural solution, reflecting an authentic problem-solving journey without altering the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. The question asks for:\n\n\\[\n3^{-1} + 3^{-2} \\mod 25\n\\]\n\nImmediately, I recognize that we're dealing with negative exponents in modular arithmetic. Negative exponents imply reciprocals, so essentially, we're looking for the modular inverses of powers of 3. Modular arithmetic reminds me of congruences, and since the modulus is 25, I need to find integer solutions within the range [0, 24].\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Strategy 1:** Compute \\(3^{-1}\\) and \\(3^{-2}\\) directly using modular inverses.\n- **Strategy 2:** Use properties of exponents and modular arithmetic to simplify.\n- **Strategy 3:** Consider Fermat's Little Theorem or Euler's Theorem if applicable.\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards **Strategy 1**\u2014finding modular inverses directly seems straightforward. But I'll keep the other strategies in mind just in case I encounter any issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Direct Computation of Modular Inverses**\n\n#### **Step 1: Compute \\(3^{-1} \\mod 25\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI need to find an integer \\(x\\) such that:\n\n\\[\n3 \\cdot x \\equiv 1 \\mod 25\n\\]\n\nThis is essentially finding the modular inverse of 3 modulo 25.\n\n**Reflection:**\nI remember that the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm** is a reliable method to find modular inverses. Alternatively, since the modulus is just 25, I could attempt guessing and checking small values. But to ensure precision, I'll proceed with the algorithm.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's apply the Euclidean Algorithm.\n\n**Euclidean Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Perform Division:\n   \n\\[\n25 \\div 3 = 8 \\text{ remainder } 1\n\\]\n   \n   So,\n\n\\[\n25 = 3 \\times 8 + 1\n\\]\n\n2. Express 1 in terms of 25 and 3:\n\n\\[\n1 = 25 - 3 \\times 8\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\nThis equation confirms that:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times (-8) \\equiv 1 \\mod 25\n\\]\n\nBut since -8 isn't within the desired range [0, 24], I need to adjust it:\n\n\\[\nx = -8 + 25 = 17\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThus,\n\n\\[\n3^{-1} \\equiv 17 \\mod 25\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\nLet's verify:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 17 = 51\n\\]\n\n\\[\n51 \\mod 25 = 1\n\\]\n\nPerfect! It checks out.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Compute \\(3^{-2} \\mod 25\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need to find \\(3^{-2}\\), which is essentially \\((3^{-1})^2\\). Since I already determined that \\(3^{-1} \\equiv 17 \\mod 25\\), I can square this value.\n\n**Action:**\nCompute:\n\n\\[\n17^2 \\mod 25\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n17^2 = 289\n\\]\n\n\\[\n289 \\mod 25 = 289 - (25 \\times 11) = 289 - 275 = 14\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo,\n\n\\[\n3^{-2} \\equiv 14 \\mod 25\n\\]\n\nThis seems reasonable. Let's do a quick check to ensure correctness.\n\n**Quick Check:**\nCompute \\(3^2 \\times 14 \\mod 25\\):\n\n\\[\n3^2 = 9\n\\]\n\n\\[\n9 \\times 14 = 126\n\\]\n\n\\[\n126 \\mod 25 = 1\n\\]\n\nYes! It checks out because:\n\n\\[\n3^2 \\times 3^{-2} \\equiv 1 \\mod 25\n\\]\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Add the Inverses**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need to add \\(3^{-1}\\) and \\(3^{-2}\\) modulo 25:\n\n\\[\n17 + 14 \\mod 25\n\\]\n\n**Action:**\n\\[\n17 + 14 = 31\n\\]\n\n\\[\n31 \\mod 25 = 31 - 25 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe result is 6, which is within the desired range [0, 24]. To ensure everything is correct, I'll perform a final check.\n\n**Quick Check:**\nAdding \\(3^{-1}\\) and \\(3^{-2}\\) should yield:\n\n\\[\n17 + 14 = 31\n\\]\n\n\\[\n31 \\mod 25 = 6\n\\]\n\nEverything aligns correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection on Strategy 1**\n\n**Did it work?**\nYes, Strategy 1 worked smoothly. By directly computing the modular inverses and adding them, I arrived at the correct answer.\n\n**Was it efficient?**\nIt was straightforward and efficient for this problem size. However, for larger moduli, leveraging algorithms like the Extended Euclidean Algorithm becomes essential.\n\n**Final Check:**\nAll intermediate steps were verified, and quick checks confirmed the correctness of each computation.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thinking Back:**\nAlthough Strategy 1 was successful, let's briefly consider whether other strategies could have been applied.\n\n- **Strategy 2:** Using properties of exponents\u2014perhaps factoring or using a geometric series. However, for modular arithmetic, direct computation proves more straightforward here.\n\n- **Strategy 3:** Applying Fermat's or Euler's Theorems. Fermat's Little Theorem applies when the modulus is prime, but since 25 isn't prime, it's less directly applicable. Euler's Theorem could be used, but given the simplicity of the modulus, it's unnecessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nStrategy 1 remains the most appropriate choice for this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n**Recapping the Process:**\n- **First Thoughts:** Recognized the need for modular inverses.\n- **Strategy 1:** Direct computation using the Euclidean Algorithm.\n  - Computed \\(3^{-1} \\equiv 17 \\mod 25\\)\n  - Computed \\(3^{-2} \\equiv 14 \\mod 25\\)\n  - Added the inverses: \\(17 + 14 \\equiv 6 \\mod 25\\)\n- **Reflection:** Each step was verified through quick checks, ensuring correctness.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Considered but deemed unnecessary for this problem.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy systematically applying modular arithmetic principles and verifying each step, I confidently arrived at the final answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough captures the natural thought process, including brainstorming, checking, and reflecting at each stage.",
  "ground_truth": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 3 and 9 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 13 + \\frac 19 \\equiv \\frac{9 + 3}{27} \\equiv \\frac{12}{2} \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{25}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \\equiv 3^{-1} \\pmod{25}$ and $b \\equiv 9^{-1} \\pmod{25}$. Then $27a \\equiv 9 \\pmod{25}$ and $27b \\equiv 3 \\pmod{25}$. Summing these congruences shows that $27(a+b) \\equiv 2(a+b) \\equiv 9 + 3 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{25}$, so $a+b \\equiv 6 \\pmod{25}$, as desired."
