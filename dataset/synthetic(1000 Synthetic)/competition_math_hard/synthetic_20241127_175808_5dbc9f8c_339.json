  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk through my initial thoughts, brainstorm potential strategies, reflect on each approach, and ensure everything checks out before arriving at the final answer. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nFind the greatest prime factor of \\(12! + 14!\\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\nOkay, I need to determine the largest prime factor of the sum \\(12! + 14!\\). I know that factorials grow rapidly, so directly computing them isn't practical. There must be a smarter way to approach this.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Factorials Concept:** \\(n!\\) means multiplying all positive integers up to \\(n\\). So, \\(12!\\) and \\(14!\\) are large numbers.\n\n- **Adding Factorials:** Adding two such large numbers will result in an even bigger number. Maybe there's a way to simplify before factoring.\n\n- **Prime Factors:** To find the greatest prime factor, breaking down the sum into its prime components is essential. Perhaps factoring out common terms could help.\n\n**Potential Strategies:**\n\n1. **Factor Out Common Terms:** Simplify \\(12! + 14!\\) by factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF).\n\n2. **Express in Terms of Smaller Factorials:** Write \\(14!\\) in terms of \\(12!\\) to see if simplification is possible.\n\n3. **Use Prime Factorization Techniques:** Once simplified, identify the prime factors to find the greatest one.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFactoring out common terms seems promising. Let's explore that strategy first and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Factoring Out Common Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf I can factor out a common factor from \\(12! + 14!\\), the expression might become easier to handle. I recall that higher factorials can be expressed in terms of lower ones, which could be beneficial.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Express \\(14!\\) in Terms of \\(12!\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  14! = 14 \\times 13 \\times 12!\n  \\]\n\n- **Rewrite the Original Expression:**\n\n  \\[\n  12! + 14! = 12! + 14 \\times 13 \\times 12!\n  \\]\n\n- **Factor Out \\(12!\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  12! (1 + 14 \\times 13)\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplify Inside the Parentheses:**\n\n  \\[\n  1 + 14 \\times 13 = 1 + 182 = 183\n  \\]\n\n  So, the expression becomes:\n\n  \\[\n  12! \\times 183\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis simplification looks correct. By factoring out \\(12!\\), I've reduced the problem to finding the greatest prime factor of \\(12! \\times 183\\). Now, I need to determine the prime factors of both \\(12!\\) and 183.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Prime Factorization of 183**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the greatest prime factor, I should start by factoring 183. It's a relatively small number, so manual factorization should be straightforward.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Check for Divisibility by 2:**  \n  183 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n\n- **Check for Divisibility by 3:**  \n  Sum of digits: \\(1 + 8 + 3 = 12\\), which is divisible by 3.  \n  Therefore, 183 is divisible by 3.\n\n  \\[\n  183 \u00f7 3 = 61\n  \\]\n\n- **Factorization Result:**  \n  \\[\n  183 = 3 \\times 61\n  \\]\n\n- **Check if 61 is Prime:**  \n  61 is not divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root (\\(\\approx 7.8\\)), so 61 is a prime number.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, 183 factors into \\(3 \\times 61\\), with 61 being a prime number. This is useful because it might be the greatest prime factor we're looking for. However, I still need to consider the prime factors of \\(12!\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Prime Factorization of \\(12!\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNext, I need to find the prime factors of \\(12!\\). Since \\(12!\\) is the product of all integers from 1 to 12, its prime factors will be all the prime numbers up to 12.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's list the prime numbers up to 12:\n- 2\n- 3\n- 5\n- 7\n- 11\n\nThese primes will have various exponents based on how many times they appear in the factorization of numbers from 1 to 12.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDo I need the exact exponents? Perhaps not for this problem, since I'm only interested in identifying the greatest prime factor.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nGiven that 61 (from 183) is larger than any prime factor of \\(12!\\), it's likely that 61 is the greatest prime factor of the entire expression. However, let's proceed step by step to confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Combining Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the prime factors of both \\(12!\\) and 183, I need to determine the greatest prime factor of their product, \\(12! \\times 183\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Prime Factors of \\(12!\\):**  \n  2, 3, 5, 7, 11\n\n- **Prime Factors of 183:**  \n  3 and 61\n\n- **Combined Prime Factors:**  \n  2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 61\n\n- **Greatest Prime Factor:**  \n  Among these, 61 is the largest.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIt seems straightforward that 61 is the greatest prime factor. But let's do a quick sanity check to ensure there's no mistake.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Sanity Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, it's good to verify that all calculations are correct and that no prime factors are overlooked.\n\n**Quick Checks:**\n\n- **Did I Factor 183 Correctly?**  \n  Yes, \\(183 = 3 \\times 61\\), and 61 is prime.\n\n- **Are All Prime Factors Accounted For?**  \n  Yes, the prime factors from \\(12!\\) are all less than 61.\n\n- **Is 61 a Prime Factor of the Entire Expression?**  \n  Yes, since 61 is a factor of 183, and 183 is multiplied by \\(12!\\), 61 is indeed a prime factor of the entire expression.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. There's no indication of an error in the factorization process.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\nThe greatest prime factor of \\(12! + 14!\\) is **61**.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically factoring out common terms and analyzing the prime factors of the resulting expression, I've determined that 61 is the greatest prime factor of \\(12! + 14!\\). Throughout the process, I ensured to verify each step, which helped in confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Insights**\n\n**Alternate Strategies Considered:**\n\n- **Direct Calculation:** Initially considered but deemed impractical due to the size of factorials.\n\n- **Prime Factorization of the Sum:** Instead of directly factorizing \\(12! + 14!\\), simplifying the expression by factoring out \\(12!\\) made the problem manageable.\n\n**Reflection on the Approach:**\n\nFactoring out the greatest common factor significantly simplified the problem, reducing it to the prime factorization of a much smaller number (183) combined with \\(12!\\). This step was crucial in efficiently identifying the greatest prime factor.\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n- **Simplifying Expressions:** Always look for ways to simplify complex expressions before attempting to solve them directly.\n\n- **Verifying each Step:** Regularly checking calculations prevents errors from propagating through the solution process.\n\n- **Flexibility in Strategies:** Being open to changing strategies upon recognizing a more efficient approach is essential in problem-solving.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThis problem demonstrated the importance of simplifying expressions and systematically analyzing their components to identify prime factors. By factoring out common terms and carefully examining the resulting factors, I efficiently arrived at the correct solution. Regular reflections and sanity checks ensured the accuracy of the process, reinforcing the reliability of the final answer.",
