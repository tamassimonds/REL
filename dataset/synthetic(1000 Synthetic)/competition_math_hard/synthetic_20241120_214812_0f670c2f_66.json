    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, thinking aloud and checking our progress as we go. The goal is to find out the expected number of times Bob will roll his six-sided die in a non-leap year.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the problem, it seems straightforward: Bob rolls a die each morning and has conditions based on the outcome. However, the twist is that if he rolls a 1, he has to roll again. This introduces a bit of complexity because it means some mornings he might roll the die more than once. \n\nI need to consider how often Bob will need to re-roll and how that affects the total number of rolls throughout the year. A non-leap year has 365 days, so that's the baseline number of mornings.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate Re-roll Probability:** Determine the probability of rolling a 1 and needing to re-roll, then compute the expected number of rolls per day.\n\n2. **Use Expected Value Formula:** Apply expected value concepts to calculate the average number of rolls per day, then multiply by 365.\n\n3. **Simulation Approach:** Although not feasible for an exact answer here, thinking about simulating thousands of days could give an intuition check.\n\nI think the first two strategies are more analytical and will lead us directly to the answer. The simulation is more of a backup to verify.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Calculate Re-roll Probability**\n\nLet's start by determining the probability of needing to roll again. \n\n- **Die Outcomes:** A fair six-sided die has outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n- **Re-roll Condition:** If Bob rolls a 1, he rolls again.\n\n**Probability of Rolling a 1:**  \nThere is 1 side with a 1 out of 6 total sides.  \n\\[ P(\\text{Roll a 1}) = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\n**Probability of Not Re-rolling (Rolling 2-6):**  \n\\[ P(\\text{Roll 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6}) = \\frac{5}{6} \\]\n\nSo, on any given roll, there's a \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) chance that Bob will need to roll again.\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nWait a minute\u2014if there's a \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) chance to roll again, does that mean Bob always rolls exactly once plus possibly more? It seems like we need to account for the possibility of multiple re-rolls in a single morning.\n\nThis suggests that we need to use an expected value approach to handle the potential for multiple re-rolls.\n\n### **Switching to Strategy 2: Use Expected Value Formula**\n\nOkay, let's pivot to using expected values. The expected number of rolls per morning can be determined by considering the probability of rolling a 1 and needing to roll again.\n\n**Expected Number of Rolls (E):**  \n\\[ E = 1 + P(\\text{Roll a 1}) \\times E \\]  \nThis equation states that Bob always rolls at least once, and if he rolls a 1, he expects to roll again, which adds to the total expected rolls.\n\nPlugging in the probability:  \n\\[ E = 1 + \\frac{1}{6} \\times E \\]\n\n**Solving for E:**  \nLet's rearrange the equation to solve for E.\n\n1. Subtract \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times E \\) from both sides:\n   \\[ E - \\frac{1}{6}E = 1 \\]\n   \n2. Factor out E:\n   \\[ E \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{6}\\right) = 1 \\]\n   \n3. Simplify:\n   \\[ E \\times \\frac{5}{6} = 1 \\]\n   \n4. Divide both sides by \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\) to isolate E:\n   \\[ E = \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{6}} = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2 \\]\n\n**Interpretation:**  \nThe expected number of rolls per morning is 1.2.\n\n### **Checking the Approach**\n\nDoes this make sense? Intuitively, since there's a 1 in 6 chance of needing to roll again, the average number of rolls per day should be slightly more than 1. Given that \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of the time Bob rolls again, adding an extra \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) roll per day seems reasonable.\n\nSo, it seems like our approach is correct.\n\n### **Calculating Total Expected Rolls in a Non-Leap Year**\n\nNow that we know the expected number of rolls per morning is 1.2, we can calculate the total expected rolls over 365 days.\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Expected Rolls} = 365 \\times 1.2 \\]\n\nPerforming the multiplication:  \n\\[ 365 \\times 1.2 = 438 \\]\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's think about whether this number makes sense. If Bob rolls once per day, that's 365 rolls. Since he rolls again only when he gets a 1 (which happens \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of the time), adding an extra 73 rolls (which is \\( 365 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\)) seems logical.\n\nSo, the total of 438 rolls aligns with our expectations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>438 solution</ANSWER>\n\nIn a non-leap year, Bob is expected to roll his die **438 times**.\n\n---\n\nThat's it! By carefully considering the probability of re-rolling and applying expected value concepts, we've arrived at the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the expected value of the number of times Bob rolls his die on a single day be $E$. When Bob rolls his die, there is a $\\frac{5}{6}$ chance that he will stop rolling after one roll, and a $\\frac{1}{6}$ chance that he will have to start over. In the second case, since his first roll had no effect on the outcome, Bob will on average roll his die $E$ more times, for a total of $1+E$ times that day. Therefore, we know that $E=\\frac{5}{6}(1)+\\frac{1}{6}(1+E)$, or that $E=\\frac{6}{5}$. Over 365 days, Bob will roll his die an average of $\\frac{6}{5}\\cdot365=\\boxed{438}$ times total."
