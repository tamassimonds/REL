  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, we need to find the product of all the coordinates where two circles intersect. The equations given are:\n\n1. \\( x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 10y + 25 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 - 8x + y^2 - 10y + 37 = 0 \\)\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n- This looks like a system of two circle equations. I remember that the points of intersection can be found by solving the system simultaneously.\n- Maybe I can **subtract one equation from the other** to simplify things?\n- Alternatively, I could **complete the square** to express each equation in standard circle form, which might make it easier to visualize.\n- Or perhaps use **substitution** if one method doesn\u2019t work.\n\nI'm not entirely sure which method will be quickest, so I\u2019ll start by trying to simplify the equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplifying the Equations by Subtraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s try subtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate some terms. This might simplify things and help us find a relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&(x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 10y + 25) \\\\\n&\\quad - (x^2 - 8x + y^2 - 10y + 37) = 0 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow (x^2 - x^2) + (-2x - (-8x)) + (y^2 - y^2) + (-10y - (-10y)) + (25 - 37) = 0 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow 0 + 6x + 0 + 0 - 12 = 0 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow 6x - 12 = 0 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow 6x = 12 \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow x = 2\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute, by subtracting the equations, I ended up with \\( x = 2 \\). This gives me a specific value for \\( x \\), which is great! But I need to find the corresponding \\( y \\)-coordinates at this \\( x \\)-value. \n\nI think this approach is working so far. Now, let\u2019s plug \\( x = 2 \\) back into one of the original equations to find \\( y \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving for \\( y \\) When \\( x = 2 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI'll substitute \\( x = 2 \\) into the first equation to solve for \\( y \\). If both circles intersect at \\( x = 2 \\), the corresponding \\( y \\)-values will give me the points of intersection.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 2 \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(2)^2 - 2(2) + y^2 - 10y + 25 &= 0 \\\\\n4 - 4 + y^2 - 10y + 25 &= 0 \\\\\n0 + y^2 - 10y + 25 &= 0 \\\\\ny^2 - 10y + 25 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in \\( y \\). I can solve it using the quadratic formula or by completing the square. Let\u2019s see if it factors nicely or if completing the square is easier.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Quadratic Equation for \\( y \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s try factoring the quadratic equation first:\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 10y + 25 = (y - 5)^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(y - 5)^2 = 0 \\implies y = 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOh, interesting! The quadratic factors perfectly, which means there\u2019s only one unique \\( y \\)-value: \\( y = 5 \\). So, the point of intersection is \\( (2, 5) \\).\n\n**But wait\u2014**since both equations are circles, I expected possibly two points of intersection. Maybe these circles are tangent at this point, meaning they touch at only one point. I should verify this by checking the second equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying with the Second Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s substitute \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 5 \\) back into the second equation to confirm that this point lies on both circles.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 5 \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(2)^2 - 8(2) + (5)^2 - 10(5) + 37 &= 0 \\\\\n4 - 16 + 25 - 50 + 37 &= 0 \\\\\n-12 + 25 - 50 + 37 &= 0 \\\\\n13 - 50 + 37 &= 0 \\\\\n0 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nPerfect! The point \\( (2, 5) \\) satisfies both equations, confirming that it\u2019s the point of intersection. Since we only found one point, it suggests that the circles are tangent to each other at this point.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Subtracting the equations led us to \\( x = 2 \\).\n- Substituting \\( x = 2 \\) gave us \\( y = 5 \\).\n- Verifying with the second equation confirmed the point \\( (2, 5) \\).\n\nEverything checks out so far!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Determining the Product of the Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, the problem asks for the product of all the coordinates of all the points of intersection. Since we only have one point of intersection \\( (2, 5) \\), the product is simply:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 5 = 10\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Product} = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat seems straightforward. But to ensure I haven\u2019t missed anything, let\u2019s briefly revisit the steps:\n\n- Simplified the system by subtracting the equations: \u2705\n- Found \\( x = 2 \\): \u2705\n- Solved for \\( y = 5 \\): \u2705\n- Verified the point \\( (2, 5) \\) with both equations: \u2705\n- Only one intersection point exists, so the product is \\( 10 \\): \u2705\n\nAll steps align correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let\u2019s consider:\n\n- Did I explore multiple strategies? Yes, started with subtraction and verified by substitution.\n- Did I verify the solution? Yes, substituted back into both equations.\n- Does the solution make sense? Yes, the circles are tangent, meaning only one point of intersection.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\(<ANSWER>10</ANSWER>\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything seems correct. By systematically simplifying the equations and verifying the solution, we confidently arrived at the product of the coordinates being \\( 10 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Method: Completing the Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nJust to double-check, let\u2019s see what happens if we express each equation in the standard form of a circle by completing the square. This might provide additional insight or confirm the tangency.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Completing the Square for the First Equation**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 2x + y^2 - 10y + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Completing the Square for \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 2x \\rightarrow (x - 1)^2 - 1\n\\]\n\n**Completing the Square for \\( y \\):**\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 10y \\rightarrow (y - 5)^2 - 25\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Back:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(x - 1)^2 - 1 + (y - 5)^2 - 25 + 25 &= 0 \\\\\n(x - 1)^2 + (y - 5)^2 - 1 &= 0 \\\\\n(x - 1)^2 + (y - 5)^2 &= 1\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThis represents a circle centered at \\( (1, 5) \\) with a radius of 1.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Completing the Square for the Second Equation**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x + y^2 - 10y + 37 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Completing the Square for \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x \\rightarrow (x - 4)^2 - 16\n\\]\n\n**Completing the Square for \\( y \\):**\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 10y \\rightarrow (y - 5)^2 - 25\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Back:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(x - 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 5)^2 - 25 + 37 &= 0 \\\\\n(x - 4)^2 + (y - 5)^2 - 4 &= 0 \\\\\n(x - 4)^2 + (y - 5)^2 &= 4\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThis represents a circle centered at \\( (4, 5) \\) with a radius of 2.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Centers:** The first circle is centered at \\( (1, 5) \\) and the second at \\( (4, 5) \\).\n- **Distance Between Centers:** The distance between the centers is \\( |4 - 1| = 3 \\).\n- **Sum of Radii:** The sum of the radii is \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe distance between the centers equals the sum of the radii, indicating that the circles are **externally tangent** at exactly one point: \\( (2, 5) \\).\n\n---\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- Both methods (simplifying by subtraction and completing the square) lead to the same point of intersection.\n- The product of the coordinates remains \\( 10 \\).\n\n\\(<ANSWER>10</ANSWER>\\)\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nBy exploring multiple strategies\u2014simplifying the system and completing the square\u2014we confirmed that the two circles are tangent at the point \\( (2, 5) \\). The product of the coordinates is \\( 10 \\), ensuring the solution's correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough a step-by-step approach, beginning with simplifying the equations by subtraction and verifying the solution through substitution, we determined that the circles intersect at a single point \\( (2, 5) \\). An alternative method of completing the square confirmed this result, illustrating that the circles are externally tangent. Consequently, the product of the intersection coordinates is \\( 10 \\).",
  "ground_truth": "Add $(-2/2)^2$ and $(-10/2)^2$ to the first equation and $(-8/2)^2$ and $(-10/2)^2$ to the second equation to find that the given equations are equivalent to \\begin{align*}\n(x^2-2x+1)+(y^2-10y+25)&=1\\text{, and} \\\\\n(x^2-8x+16)+(y^2-10y+25)&=4\n\\end{align*} which are equivalent to \\begin{align*}\n(x-1)^2+(y-5)^2 &=1^2, \\\\\n(x-4)^2+(y-5)^2 &=2^2,\n\\end{align*} respectively.  Hence, the two circles have centers $(1,5)$ and $(4,5)$ respectively and radii $1$ and $2$ respectively. Since the centers of the circles are $3$ units apart and the sum of their radii is $3$, the two circles intersect at only one point.  We can see that $(2,5)$ is the desired intersection point, so our product is $2 \\cdot 5 =\\boxed{10}$."
