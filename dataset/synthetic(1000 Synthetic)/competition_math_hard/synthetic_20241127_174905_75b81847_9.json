  "problem": "Let $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ be the vertices of a regular tetrahedron each of whose edges measures 1 meter. A bug, starting from vertex $A$, observes the following rule: at each vertex it chooses one of the three edges meeting at that vertex, each edge being equally likely to be chosen, and crawls along that edge to the vertex at its opposite end. Let $p = \\frac n{729}$ be the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ when it has crawled exactly 7 meters. Find the value of $n$.\n",
  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's organize the original working out into a polished and complete solution, maintaining the final answer. I'll streamline the thought process, ensuring clarity while preserving the problem-solving journey.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to determine the probability that a bug, crawling along the edges of a regular tetrahedron with each edge measuring 1 meter, returns to its starting vertex \\( A \\) after traveling exactly 7 meters. The probability should be expressed as \\( \\frac{n}{729} \\), and we're tasked with finding the value of \\( n \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nThis resembles a probability problem involving random walks on a graph. Strategies like recursion, Markov chains, or exploiting symmetry might be useful. Let's explore these to find the most effective approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Recursion and Probability Trees:**  \n   Calculate the probability of being at each vertex after each move using recursive relationships.\n\n2. **Markov Chains:**  \n   Model the movement as a Markov process with states representing each vertex.\n\n3. **Symmetry and Combinatorics:**  \n   Utilize the symmetrical properties of the tetrahedron to simplify calculations.\n\n4. **Generating Functions:**  \n   Employ generating functions to handle the multiple paths the bug can take.\n\n**Leaning Towards Recursion and Probability Trees:**  \nGiven its straightforward nature and alignment with similar problems, recursion seems promising. We'll start here but remain open to pivoting if necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementing the Recursion Approach**\n\n#### **Step 1: Defining the States**\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( P_n(A) \\): Probability of being at vertex \\( A \\) after crawling \\( n \\) meters.\n- \\( P_n(B) \\), \\( P_n(C) \\), \\( P_n(D) \\): Probabilities for the other vertices.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nDue to the tetrahedron's symmetry, the probabilities at vertices \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) should be identical. This symmetry can simplify our calculations.\n\n#### **Step 2: Establishing Recurrence Relations**\n\nAt each step, the bug has three equally likely options to move to adjacent vertices. Therefore:\n\n- Probability of being at \\( A \\) after \\( n \\) meters:\n  \\[\n  P_n(A) = \\frac{1}{3}[P_{n-1}(B) + P_{n-1}(C) + P_{n-1}(D)]\n  \\]\n\n- Similarly, for any other vertex, say \\( B \\):\n  \\[\n  P_n(B) = \\frac{1}{3}[P_{n-1}(A) + P_{n-1}(C) + P_{n-1}(D)]\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense since the bug can only move to a vertex from its neighbors in the previous step.\n\n#### **Step 3: Leveraging Symmetry**\n\nGiven \\( P_n(B) = P_n(C) = P_n(D) \\), let's denote this common probability as \\( P_n(O) \\). Thus:\n\n\\[\nP_n(A) + 3P_n(O) = 1\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( P_n(O) \\):\n\n\\[\nP_n(O) = \\frac{1 - P_n(A)}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThis equation ensures that the total probability across all vertices sums to 1, which is consistent.\n\n#### **Step 4: Simplifying the Recurrence**\n\nSubstituting \\( P_n(O) \\) back into the equation for \\( P_n(A) \\):\n\n\\[\nP_n(A) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 3P_{n-1}(O) = P_{n-1}(O) = \\frac{1 - P_{n-1}(A)}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, we have a single recurrence relation for \\( P_n(A) \\), making it easier to compute iteratively up to \\( n = 7 \\).\n\n#### **Step 5: Establishing Initial Conditions**\n\n- At \\( n = 0 \\):  \n  \\( P_0(A) = 1 \\) (since the bug starts at \\( A \\))  \n  \\( P_0(O) = 0 \\) (since the bug isn't at any other vertex)\n\n#### **Step 6: Iterative Calculation**\n\nLet's compute \\( P_n(A) \\) from \\( n = 1 \\) to \\( n = 7 \\):\n\n- **For \\( n = 1 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  P_1(A) = \\frac{1 - P_0(A)}{3} = \\frac{1 - 1}{3} = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **For \\( n = 2 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  P_2(A) = \\frac{1 - P_1(A)}{3} = \\frac{1 - 0}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n  \n- **For \\( n = 3 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  P_3(A) = \\frac{1 - P_2(A)}{3} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{3}}{3} = \\frac{2}{9}\n  \\]\n  \n- **For \\( n = 4 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  P_4(A) = \\frac{1 - P_3(A)}{3} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{2}{9}}{3} = \\frac{7}{27}\n  \\]\n  \n- **For \\( n = 5 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  P_5(A) = \\frac{1 - P_4(A)}{3} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{7}{27}}{3} = \\frac{20}{81}\n  \\]\n  \n- **For \\( n = 6 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  P_6(A) = \\frac{1 - P_5(A)}{3} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{20}{81}}{3} = \\frac{61}{243}\n  \\]\n  \n- **For \\( n = 7 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  P_7(A) = \\frac{1 - P_6(A)}{3} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{61}{243}}{3} = \\frac{182}{729}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nThe probabilities are consistent, and the final probability matches the desired format \\( \\frac{n}{729} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Validating the Solution**\n\nGiven our final probability:\n\n\\[\nP_7(A) = \\frac{182}{729}\n\\]\n\nThis aligns with the question's format \\( p = \\frac{n}{729} \\), so:\n\n\\[\nn = 182\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\( n = 182 \\)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **Strategy Effectiveness:**  \n  The recursion approach, leveraging the tetrahedron's symmetry, provided a clear and efficient path to the solution.\n\n- **Consistency Checks:**  \n  Throughout the process, ensuring that probabilities summed to 1 and verifying each step's correctness helped maintain accuracy.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:**  \n  Although other methods like Markov Chains or Generating Functions could solve the problem, they would introduce unnecessary complexity for this specific case.\n\n- **Problem-Solving Reflection:**  \n  Starting with multiple strategies and refining the chosen approach ensured a robust and reliable solution.\n\nBy following a structured approach\u2014defining states, establishing recurrence relations, and verifying each calculation step\u2014we arrived confidently at the correct answer: \\( n = 182 \\).",
  "ground_truth": "Let $P(n)$ denote the probability that the bug is at $A$ after it has crawled $n$ meters. Since the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex which is not $A$, we have $P(n + 1) = \\frac13 (1 - P(n))$. We also know $P(0) = 1$, so we can quickly compute $P(1)=0$, $P(2) = \\frac 13$, $P(3) = \\frac29$, $P(4) = \\frac7{27}$, $P(5) = \\frac{20}{81}$, $P(6) = \\frac{61}{243}$ and $P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{182}$. One can solve this recursion fairly easily to determine a closed-form expression for $P(n)$."
