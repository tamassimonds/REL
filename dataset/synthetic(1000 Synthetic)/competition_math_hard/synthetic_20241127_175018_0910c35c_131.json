  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk you through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper\u2014brainstorming different strategies, checking my work frequently, and being open to changing direction if things don't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, so we have two equations involving \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = 3\n\\]\n\\[\nxy + x + y = 4\n\\]\n\nAnd we need to compute \\( x^2y + xy^2 \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**  \n\n- This looks like a system of nonlinear equations. I remember dealing with similar problems where substituting or factoring helped.\n- The first equation involves reciprocals, which might suggest manipulating it to eliminate fractions.\n- The second equation is quadratic in nature, hinting at possibly using factoring or identities.\n- I'm not entirely sure of the best path yet, so I'll consider multiple strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Express \\( \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} \\) in Terms of \\( xy \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n\nI recall that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{x+y}{xy}\n\\]\n\nMaybe rewriting the first equation this way could help.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x+y}{xy} = 3 \\implies x+y = 3xy\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\n- Now I have \\( x+y = 3xy \\). This seems useful because I can relate it to the second equation.\n- Let's see how this ties into the second equation.\n\n#### **Substitution into the Second Equation**\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\nReplace \\( x+y \\) in the second equation:\n\n\\[\nxy + (x+y) = 4 \\implies xy + 3xy = 4 \\implies 4xy = 4 \\implies xy = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n\n- Wait a minute, that simplifies nicely to \\( xy = 1 \\).\n- This feels correct because it aligns both equations.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\n- With \\( xy = 1 \\) and \\( x+y = 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\), I have two straightforward relationships.\n- I think I can find \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) individually now.\n\n---\n\n### **Finding \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n\n- I have \\( x+y = 3 \\) and \\( xy = 1 \\).\n- This resembles a quadratic equation's roots. Perhaps I can set up a quadratic to find \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n#### **Setting Up the Quadratic Equation**\n\n\\[\nt^2 - (x+y)t + xy = 0 \\implies t^2 - 3t + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 1}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Solutions:**  \n\n\\[\nt_1 = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}, \\quad t_2 = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n\n- These values make sense as the roots of the quadratic equation.\n- So, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are \\( \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\n- This aligns with our earlier equations. No contradictions here, so I feel confident moving forward.\n\n---\n\n### **Computing \\( x^2y + xy^2 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n\n- Now, back to the original goal: compute \\( x^2y + xy^2 \\).\n- I notice that \\( x^2y + xy^2 \\) can be factored as \\( xy(x + y) \\).\n- Since I already know \\( xy = 1 \\) and \\( x+y = 3 \\), this should be straightforward.\n\n#### **Calculation**\n\n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = xy(x + y) = 1 \\times 3 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n\n- Multiplying \\( xy \\) and \\( x+y \\) gives 3.\n- This seems consistent with all the relationships we've established.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\n- Everything checks out. The calculations are straightforward, and there's no indication of errors.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = 3\n\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \n\n- Starting by rewriting the first equation was a good move. It simplified the system and led directly to finding \\( xy \\) and \\( x+y \\).\n- Setting up the quadratic equation confirmed the individual values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), ensuring consistency.\n- Factoring \\( x^2y + xy^2 \\) made the final computation straightforward.\n\n**Lessons Learned:**  \n\n- Rewriting equations to eliminate fractions can simplify complex systems.\n- Always look for relationships between given equations to reduce variables.\n- Verifying each step prevents small mistakes from propagating.\n\n**Overall Reflection:**  \n\nThis approach worked smoothly, but it's always good to be open to alternative methods, especially if the first strategy doesn't pan out. Regularly checking each step helps maintain accuracy and confidence in the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Complete Solution**\n\n**Step 1:** Rewriting the First Equation\n\nWe start by expressing \\( \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{x+y}{xy} = 3 \\implies x+y = 3xy\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Substituting into the Second Equation\n\nReplace \\( x+y \\) in the second equation:\n\n\\[\nxy + x + y = 4 \\implies xy + 3xy = 4 \\implies 4xy = 4 \\implies xy = 1\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Establishing Relationships\n\nNow, we have:\n\n\\[\nx+y = 3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad xy = 1\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Setting Up the Quadratic Equation\n\nThese resemble the sum and product of roots of a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nt^2 - (x+y)t + xy = 0 \\implies t^2 - 3t + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 5:** Solving the Quadratic Equation\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\nx, y = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Step 6:** Computing \\( x^2y + xy^2 \\)\n\nWe factor the expression:\n\n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = xy(x + y)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n= 1 \\times 3 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = 3\n\\]\n\n---\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, checking each step, and validating the results, we arrived confidently at the final solution: \n\n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = 3\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The first equation becomes\n\n$$\\frac{x+y}{xy}=3\\Rightarrow x+y=3xy$$\n\nSubstituting into the second equation,\n\n$$4xy=4\\Rightarrow xy=1$$\n\nThus $x+y=3$.\n\nThe quantity we desire factors as $xy(x+y)$, so it is equal to $1(3)=\\boxed{3}$."
