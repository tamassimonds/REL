  "problem": "In a certain city the rate of taxation is the following: $x\\%$ tax is collected for an income of $x$ thousand dollars. What income, in dollars, will yield the greatest take home pay? (Take-home pay  is the income minus the tax on that income.)",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I'd naturally work through it if I encountered it for the first time.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about taxation in a city where the tax rate is \\( x\\% \\) for an income of \\( x \\) thousand dollars. The goal is to find the income that yields the greatest take-home pay, which is the income minus the tax.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- This reminds me of optimization problems I've seen before.\n- It seems like there's a relationship between income and tax rate that's directly proportional.\n- I\u2019m thinking calculus might be involved since maximizing take-home pay sounds like finding a maximum point.\n\n**But Wait:**\n\n- Calculus can be tricky; maybe there's a simpler way?\n- Perhaps I can model this with an equation first to see what it looks like.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Set Up an Equation:**  \n   Write an expression for take-home pay and see if I can maximize it.\n\n2. **Use Calculus:**  \n   Find the derivative and set it to zero to find critical points.\n\n3. **Try Different Values:**  \n   Plug in sample incomes to observe patterns.\n\n4. **Graph the Function:**  \n   Visualize the relationship between income and take-home pay.\n\n**Leaning Towards:**\n\n- Starting with setting up an equation seems logical.\n- If that doesn't work, I can move to calculus or try plugging in values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation**\n\nLet\u2019s define the variables:\n\n- **Income (\\( I \\)):** \\( x \\) thousand dollars\n- **Tax Rate:** \\( x\\% \\) or \\( 0.01x \\)\n- **Tax Paid:** \\( 0.01x \\times x = 0.01x^2 \\) thousand dollars\n- **Take-Home Pay (\\( TH \\)):** Income minus tax  \n  \\[ TH = x - 0.01x^2 \\text{ (in thousands)} \\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- This makes sense because I\u2019m subtracting the tax from the income.\n- The equation looks quadratic, which is familiar territory for finding maxima.\n\n**Checking:**\n\n- Does the equation reflect the problem statement?  \n  Yes, the tax increases with income at a quadratic rate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Maximizing the Take-Home Pay**\n\nNow, I need to find the value of \\( x \\) that maximizes \\( TH \\).\n\n**Options:**\n\n- **Use Calculus:** Take the derivative of \\( TH \\) with respect to \\( x \\) and set it to zero.\n- **Complete the Square:** Since it's a quadratic equation, completing the square could also work.\n- **Find the Vertex:** Use the vertex formula for a parabola.\n\n**Preference:**\n\n- I'll start with calculus since it's straightforward for optimization.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying Calculus**\n\nTake the derivative of \\( TH \\) with respect to \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d(TH)}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x - 0.01x^2 \\right) = 1 - 0.02x\n\\]\n\n**Set the Derivative to Zero:**\n\n\\[\n1 - 0.02x = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n0.02x = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{1}{0.02} = 50\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- So, \\( x = 50 \\), which means an income of 50 thousand dollars.\n- This suggests that at 50k, the take-home pay is maximized.\n\n**But Let\u2019s Verify:**\n\n- Is this really the maximum? I should check if it's a maximum point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Confirming the Maximum**\n\n**Second Derivative Test:**\n\nTake the second derivative of \\( TH \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2(TH)}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx} (1 - 0.02x) = -0.02\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n- The second derivative is negative (\\( -0.02 \\)), which indicates that the function is concave down at \\( x = 50 \\).\n- Therefore, \\( x = 50 \\) is indeed a maximum point.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- This confirms that 50 thousand dollars is the income yielding the greatest take-home pay.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Maximum Take-Home Pay**\n\nLet\u2019s plug \\( x = 50 \\) back into the take-home pay equation:\n\n\\[\nTH = 50 - 0.01(50)^2 = 50 - 0.01(2500) = 50 - 25 = 25 \\text{ thousand dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- So, with an income of 50k, the take-home pay is 25k.\n- This seems reasonable since the tax paid is 25k, which is half of the income.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- At \\( x = 50 \\), the tax rate is 50%, so paying half the income in tax makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Trying Different Values:**\n\n- Let's say I plug in \\( x = 30 \\) and \\( x = 70 \\) to see how the take-home pay compares.\n\n\\[\n\\text{For } x = 30: \\quad TH = 30 - 0.01(30)^2 = 30 - 9 = 21 \\text{ thousand dollars}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{For } x = 70: \\quad TH = 70 - 0.01(70)^2 = 70 - 49 = 21 \\text{ thousand dollars}\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n- Both lower and higher incomes than 50k yield a lower take-home pay of 21k.\n- This supports our earlier conclusion that 50k is the optimal income.\n\n**Graphing the Function:**\n\n- If I graph \\( TH = x - 0.01x^2 \\), it would be a parabola opening downwards with its vertex at \\( x = 50 \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- Visualizing it confirms that 50k is the peak point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Does the Solution Make Sense?**\n\n- At 50k income, the tax rate is 50%, resulting in a take-home pay of 25k.\n- The tax paid equals the take-home pay, which seems like a balanced point.\n\n**Possible Concerns:**\n\n- Is there any scenario where a different income could yield a better take-home pay?\n- Given the quadratic nature of the equation, and the confirmed maximum point, it's unlikely.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- All methods (calculus, plugging values, and graphing) agree that 50k is the optimal income.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Final Solution**\n\nThe income that yields the greatest take-home pay is **50,000 dollars**.\n\n---\n\n### **Post-Solution Check**\n\n**Alternative Approaches:**\n\n- **Completing the Square:**  \n  I could have rewritten the equation to find the vertex directly, but calculus provided a quicker path.\n\n- **Using the Vertex Formula:**  \n  For a quadratic \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), the vertex is at \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\). Here, \\( a = -0.01 \\) and \\( b = 1 \\), so:\n  \\[\n  x = -\\frac{1}{2 \\times (-0.01)} = 50\n  \\]\n  This matches our earlier result.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- The problem was straightforward once the equation was set up.\n- Calculus efficiently led us to the solution, and verifying through multiple methods strengthened the confidence in the answer.\n\n---\n\nBy exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying the solution through various methods, we've arrived confidently at the final solution: an income of 50,000 dollars yields the greatest take-home pay in this taxation scenario.",
  "ground_truth": "The amount of tax collected is $\\frac{x}{100} \\cdot 1000x = 10x^2,$ so the take home pay is\n\\[1000x - 10x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n1000x - 10x^2 &= -10(x^2 - 100x) \\\\\n&= -10(x^2 - 100x + 2500) + 25000 \\\\\n&= -10(x - 50)^2 + 25000.\n\\end{align*}The maximum take home pay occurs when $x = 50,$ which corresponds to an income of $\\boxed{50000}$ dollars."
