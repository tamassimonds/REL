  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem again, aiming to create a coherent and complete solution. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, complete with brainstorming, checking my work, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, we have two urns with balls of different colors, and we're drawing one ball from each urn. The probability that both balls are the same color is given as \\(0.58\\). We need to find \\(N\\), the number of blue balls in the second urn.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- This reminds me of probability problems involving multiple events.\n- I think we'll need to calculate the probabilities of drawing same-colored balls from both urns.\n- Not exactly sure how to set it up yet, but maybe using the law of total probability.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Calculate Probability of Same Colors Directly:**\n   - Find the probability of both balls being green.\n   - Find the probability of both balls being blue.\n   - Add those probabilities together.\n\n2. **Consider Complementary Probability:**\n   - Calculate the probability of drawing different colors and subtract from 1.\n   - Hmm, might be an alternative approach if the first doesn't work.\n\n3. **Set Up an Equation Involving \\(N\\):**\n   - Since \\(N\\) is unknown, we'll need to express probabilities in terms of \\(N\\).\n   - Solving for \\(N\\) will be necessary.\n\n**I think Strategy 1 makes the most sense to start with. Let's see how it goes.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Probability of Both Balls Being Green**\n\nLet's calculate the probability that both balls drawn are green.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **First Urn:** 4 green and 6 blue balls. Total = 10 balls.\n  - Probability of drawing a green ball = \\(\\frac{4}{10} = 0.4\\).\n\n- **Second Urn:** 16 green and \\(N\\) blue balls. Total = \\(16 + N\\) balls.\n  - Probability of drawing a green ball = \\(\\frac{16}{16 + N}\\).\n\n- **Probability Both Are Green:**\n  - Multiply probabilities from both urns: \n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Both Green}) = 0.4 \\times \\frac{16}{16 + N}\n  \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Both Green}) = \\frac{4}{10} \\times \\frac{16}{16 + N} = \\frac{64}{10(16 + N)} = \\frac{32}{5(16 + N)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This seems straightforward. No issues so far.\n- The probability is expressed in terms of \\(N\\), which is what we need.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Probability of Both Balls Being Blue**\n\nNow, let's find the probability that both balls drawn are blue.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **First Urn:** 6 blue balls out of 10 total.\n  - Probability of drawing a blue ball = \\(\\frac{6}{10} = 0.6\\).\n\n- **Second Urn:** \\(N\\) blue balls out of \\(16 + N\\) total.\n  - Probability of drawing a blue ball = \\(\\frac{N}{16 + N}\\).\n\n- **Probability Both Are Blue:**\n  - Multiply probabilities from both urns:\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Both Blue}) = 0.6 \\times \\frac{N}{16 + N}\n  \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Both Blue}) = \\frac{6}{10} \\times \\frac{N}{16 + N} = \\frac{6N}{10(16 + N)} = \\frac{3N}{5(16 + N)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Everything checks out here. The expression is clean and in terms of \\(N\\).\n- No errors detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Total Probability of Same Color**\n\nAdd the probabilities of both balls being green and both being blue.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Total probability = \\(P(\\text{Both Green}) + P(\\text{Both Blue})\\).\n- We know this total probability is \\(0.58\\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{32}{5(16 + N)} + \\frac{3N}{5(16 + N)} = 0.58\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Combine the fractions since they have a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{32 + 3N}{5(16 + N)} = 0.58\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This sets up an equation with \\(N\\). Looks good so far.\n- Now, we need to solve for \\(N\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving for \\(N\\)**\n\nLet's solve the equation for \\(N\\).\n\n**Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{32 + 3N}{5(16 + N)} = 0.58\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction.\n- Simplify the equation to isolate \\(N\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Cross-Multiply:**\n\n   \\[\n   32 + 3N = 0.58 \\times 5(16 + N)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Right Side:**\n\n   \\[\n   32 + 3N = 2.9 \\times (16 + N)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distribute the 2.9:**\n\n   \\[\n   32 + 3N = 46.4 + 2.9N\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rearrange the Equation:**\n\n   \\[\n   32 + 3N - 2.9N = 46.4\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   32 + 0.1N = 46.4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Isolate \\(N\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   0.1N = 46.4 - 32 = 14.4\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{14.4}{0.1} = 144\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a minute...** Let\u2019s do a quick sanity check.\n  - \\(N = 144\\) seems quite large compared to the number of balls in the first urn.\n  - But given that the second urn already has 16 green balls, having 144 blue balls might balance the probabilities to achieve the 0.58 probability.\n\n- **Another Check:**\n  - Plugging \\(N = 144\\) back into the probabilities:\n    - Second urn total = \\(16 + 144 = 160\\).\n    - Probability of drawing a green ball from the second urn = \\(\\frac{16}{160} = 0.1\\).\n    - Probability of both balls being green = \\(0.4 \\times 0.1 = 0.04\\).\n    - Probability of both balls being blue = \\(0.6 \\times \\frac{144}{160} = 0.54\\).\n    - Total probability = \\(0.04 + 0.54 = 0.58\\), which matches the given probability.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The calculations are correct, and \\(N = 144\\) is indeed the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\\(N = 144\\)  \n</ANSWER>  \n  \n---\n\n### **Solution Recap**\n\n- **Probability of Both Balls Being Green:**\n  - Calculated as \\(\\frac{32}{5(16 + N)}\\).\n\n- **Probability of Both Balls Being Blue:**\n  - Calculated as \\(\\frac{3N}{5(16 + N)}\\).\n\n- **Total Probability of Same Color:**\n  - Sum of both probabilities set equal to \\(0.58\\).\n\n- **Solving for \\(N\\):**\n  - Solved the equation to find \\(N = 144\\).\n\n- **Verification:**\n  - Plugged back \\(N = 144\\) to confirm the total probability matches \\(0.58\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Does the solution make sense?**  \n  - Yes, the value of \\(N\\) aligns with the given probability.\n\n- **Is the probability calculation correct?**  \n  - Absolutely. The total probability of same-colored balls sums up to \\(0.58\\) with \\(N = 144\\).\n\n- **Have I verified the answer?**  \n  - Yes, by substituting \\(N\\) back and ensuring the probabilities add up correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully calculating the probabilities and setting up the appropriate equation, we've determined that the number of blue balls in the second urn \\(N\\) is \\(144\\). Throughout the process, regular checks and reflections ensured the accuracy of the solution.",
  "ground_truth": "First, we find the probability both are green, then the probability both are blue, and add the two probabilities. The sum should be equal to $0.58$.\nThe probability both are green is $\\frac{4}{10}\\cdot\\frac{16}{16+N}$, and the probability both are blue is $\\frac{6}{10}\\cdot\\frac{N}{16+N}$, so\\[\\frac{4}{10}\\cdot\\frac{16}{16+N}+\\frac{6}{10}\\cdot\\frac{N}{16+N}=\\frac{29}{50}\\]Solving this equation,\\[20\\left(\\frac{16}{16+N}\\right)+30\\left(\\frac{N}{16+N}\\right)=29\\]Multiplying both sides by $16+N$, we get\\[20\\cdot 16 + 30\\cdot N = 29(16+n)\\Rightarrow 320+30N=464+29N \\Rightarrow N = \\boxed{144}\\]"
