  "problem": "Krista put 1 cent into her new bank on a Sunday morning.  On Monday she put 2 cents into her bank.  On Tuesday she put 4 cents into her bank, and she continued to double the amount of money she put into her bank each day for two weeks.  On what day of the week did the total amount of money in her bank first exceed $\\$2$?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's craft a cohesive solution by synthesizing the thought process. We\u2019ll maintain the original answer but streamline the narrative for clarity and coherence.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, I'm looking at a problem where Krista doubles her bank deposit each day, starting with 1 cent on Sunday. The challenge is to find out which day the total savings exceed $2 within two weeks.\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n- **Geometric Sequence:** This doubling pattern immediately reminds me of geometric sequences.\n- **Strategies:** I could calculate the daily deposits and keep a running total to track when the $2 mark is surpassed.\n- **Possible Approaches:** Using either a step-by-step cumulative approach or applying the geometric series formula.\n\nI'm inclined to start with calculating the cumulative total day by day, as it provides a clear, straightforward path.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Daily Deposits and Cumulative Totals**\n\nLet's begin by listing the daily deposits, keeping in mind that each day\u2019s deposit is double the previous day\u2019s.\n\n**Daily Deposits:**\n\n- **Day 1 (Sunday):** 1 cent\n- **Day 2 (Monday):** 2 cents\n- **Day 3 (Tuesday):** 4 cents\n- **Day 4 (Wednesday):** 8 cents\n- **Day 5 (Thursday):** 16 cents\n- **Day 6 (Friday):** 32 cents\n- **Day 7 (Saturday):** 64 cents\n- **Day 8 (Sunday):** 128 cents\n- **Day 9 (Monday):** 256 cents\n- **Day 10 (Tuesday):** 512 cents\n- **Day 11 (Wednesday):** 1024 cents\n- **Day 12 (Thursday):** 2048 cents\n- **Day 13 (Friday):** 4096 cents\n- **Day 14 (Saturday):** 8192 cents\n\n**Reflection:**\nInitially, I listed just the daily deposits. To find out when the total exceeds $2, I realize I need to compute the cumulative total.\n\n**Cumulative Totals:**\n\nLet's add the deposits day by day:\n\n- **Day 1:** Total = 1 cent\n- **Day 2:** Total = 1 + 2 = 3 cents\n- **Day 3:** Total = 3 + 4 = 7 cents\n- **Day 4:** Total = 7 + 8 = 15 cents\n- **Day 5:** Total = 15 + 16 = 31 cents\n- **Day 6:** Total = 31 + 32 = 63 cents\n- **Day 7:** Total = 63 + 64 = 127 cents\n- **Day 8:** Total = 127 + 128 = 255 cents\n- **Day 9:** Total = 255 + 256 = 511 cents\n- **Day 10:** Total = 511 + 512 = 1023 cents\n- **Day 11:** Total = 1023 + 1024 = 2047 cents\n- **Day 12:** Total = 2047 + 2048 = 4095 cents\n- **Day 13:** Total = 4095 + 4096 = 8191 cents\n- **Day 14:** Total = 8191 + 8192 = 16383 cents\n\n**Converting to Dollars:**\n\nSince the goal is to exceed $2, let's convert the cumulative totals from cents to dollars.\n\n- **Day 8 Total:** 255 cents = $2.55\n\n**Checking the Threshold:**\n\n- **Day 7 Total:** 127 cents = $1.27 (still below $2)\n- **Day 8 Total:** 255 cents = $2.55 (exceeds $2)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOn **Day 8 (Sunday of the second week)**, the total amount first exceeds $2.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Validating with the Geometric Series Formula**\n\nTo ensure correctness, let's use the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\n**Geometric Series Formula:**\n\n\\[\nS_n = a \\times \\frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( S_n \\) is the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms\n- \\( a \\) is the first term (1 cent)\n- \\( r \\) is the common ratio (2)\n- \\( n \\) is the number of terms\n\n**Calculating for Day 8:**\n\n\\[\nS_8 = 1 \\times \\frac{2^8 - 1}{2 - 1} = 1 \\times (256 - 1) = 255 \\text{ cents} = $2.55\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis calculation aligns perfectly with our previous step, confirming that Day 8 is indeed when the total exceeds $2.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically:\n\n1. **Calculating Cumulative Totals:** Step-by-step addition confirmed that the threshold was crossed on Day 8.\n2. **Validating with Formula:** Applying the geometric series formula provided the same result, reinforcing the accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<ANSWER>\nsolution\nDay 8 (Sunday of the second week) is when the total amount in Krista's bank first exceeds $2.\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThrough a systematic exploration\u2014starting with a straightforward cumulative approach and validating with a mathematical formula\u2014I ensured the correctness of the solution. This dual strategy not only confirmed the day when the savings exceeded $2 but also deepened the understanding of geometric sequences in practical scenarios.\n\n---",
  "ground_truth": "The formula for a geometric series is $\\frac{a-ar^n}{1-r}$. Taking $a$ to be the initial $1$-cent deposit and $n$ to be the number of days Krista had money in her bank so far, we have the inequality $$\\frac{1-2^n}{1-2}\\geq 200 \\Rightarrow 1-2^n\\leq -200 \\Rightarrow 201 \\leq 2^n.$$The smallest power of 2 that is greater than 201 is $2^8$.  Thus, $n=8$ and $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$ is 7 days away from day $1$."
