  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through it step by step, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and ensuring the solution is accurate. Let's see how it unfolds.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWe need to find the length of segment \\( FX \\) in a regular hexagon \\( ABCDEF \\) with each side measuring 2 units. Side \\( AB \\) is extended past \\( B \\) to point \\( X \\) such that \\( AX = 3AB \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n- This reminds me of problems involving extending sides and utilizing geometric properties.\n- Regular hexagons have equal sides and angles, which could be helpful.\n- Possible approaches:\n  - **Coordinate Geometry:** Assign coordinates to vertices and calculate distances.\n  - **Vector Geometry:** Use vectors to represent sides and compute \\( FX \\).\n  - **Symmetry and Geometric Properties:** Leverage the symmetry of hexagons to simplify the problem.\n  \nI'm not entirely sure which method is best, so let's explore them one by one.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n#### **1. Coordinate Geometry Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Assign coordinates to each vertex and point \\( X \\), then use the distance formula to find \\( FX \\).\n- This seems straightforward but might involve messy calculations.\n\n**Assigning Coordinates:**\n\n- Place the hexagon on a coordinate plane.\n- Let\u2019s say \\( A \\) is at the origin: \\( A(0, 0) \\).\n- Compute coordinates for other vertices based on hexagon geometry.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, plotting all coordinates might be time-consuming. Is there a simpler way? Maybe coordinate geometry isn't the most efficient approach here.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI'll put this method aside for now and try something else. If other methods don't work, I can come back to it.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Vector Geometry Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Use vectors to represent sides and extend \\( AB \\) to \\( X \\).\n- Calculate \\( FX \\) using vector addition.\n\n**Assigning Vectors:**\n\n- Let\u2019s assign vectors to each side.\n- \\( \\vec{AB} \\) has a magnitude of 2 units.\n- Since \\( AX = 3AB \\), \\( \\vec{AX} = 6 \\) units (because \\( AX = 3 \\times 2 \\)).\n\n**Calculating \\( FX \\):**\n\n- Express \\( \\vec{FX} \\) as a combination of \\( \\vec{AB} \\) and other vectors.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis is getting complicated. I'm not sure if this is the best path. Perhaps there's a more straightforward way using geometric properties.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nLet\u2019s try another method. If vector geometry isn't clear, maybe symmetry will help.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Symmetry and Geometric Properties**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Regular hexagons have rotational and reflectional symmetry.\n- Extending a side might create familiar geometric shapes like triangles.\n- Leveraging properties of equilateral triangles could simplify the problem.\n\n**Exploring:**\n\n- Each internal angle of a regular hexagon is \\(120^\\circ\\).\n- Extending \\( AB \\) to \\( X \\) such that \\( AX = 6 \\) (since \\( AX = 3 \\times 2 \\)).\n\n**Visualizing:**\n\n- By extending \\( AB \\) to \\( X \\), \\( AX = 6 \\).\n- This forms triangle \\( ABX \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOh! By extending \\( AB \\) to \\( X \\), larger geometric shapes are created that can be decomposed into familiar triangles.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nLet's proceed with this symmetry approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Symmetry Approach: Detailed Steps**\n\n#### **Step 1: Identify Relevant Triangles**\n\n- Triangle \\( ABX \\) is formed by extending \\( AB \\) to \\( X \\).\n- \\( AX = 6 \\) and \\( AB = 2 \\).\n- The angle at \\( B \\) is \\(120^\\circ\\).\n\n#### **Step 2: Determine Triangle Type**\n\n- Triangle \\( ABX \\) has sides \\( AB = 2 \\), \\( BX = 4 \\) (since \\( AX = 6 \\)), and \\( \\angle ABX = 120^\\circ \\).\n- This suggests it might be an isosceles triangle.\n\n#### **Step 3: Analyze Triangle \\( ABX \\)**\n\n- Since \\( AX = 6 \\) and \\( AB = 2 \\), the remaining side \\( BX = 4 \\).\n- The angles could help determine relationships with other parts of the hexagon.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nInstead of diving into angle calculations, let's look for congruent triangles or parallelograms within the hexagon.\n\n#### **Step 4: Identify Congruent Triangles**\n\n- Inside the hexagon, triangle \\( AFB \\) is an equilateral triangle with sides \\( AB = AF = BF = 2 \\).\n\n#### **Step 5: Utilize Triangle \\( AFB \\)**\n\n- Triangle \\( AFB \\) is equilateral.\n- Extend \\( AB \\) to \\( X \\) and see how \\( FX \\) relates to \\( AX \\).\n\n#### **Step 6: Apply Law of Cosines in Triangle \\( AFX \\)**\n\n- Triangle \\( AFX \\) has:\n  - \\( AF = 2 \\)\n  - \\( AX = 6 \\)\n  - \\( \\angle AFX = 120^\\circ \\) (since \\( \\angle AFB = 120^\\circ \\) and \\( X \\) is along \\( AB \\) extended).\n\n**Writing It Out:**\n\n\\[\nFX^2 = AF^2 + AX^2 - 2 \\times AF \\times AX \\times \\cos(120^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting known values:\n\n\\[\nFX^2 = 2^2 + 6^2 - 2 \\times 2 \\times 6 \\times (-\\frac{1}{2})\n\\]\n\n\\[\nFX^2 = 4 + 36 + 12 = 52\n\\]\n\n\\[\nFX = \\sqrt{52} = 2\\sqrt{13}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nQuick check:\n- Used \\( \\cos(120^\\circ) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n- Calculations align with the law of cosines.\n- The result \\( FX = 2\\sqrt{13} \\) seems plausible given the lengths involved.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies and reflecting at each step, using the law of cosines in triangle \\( AFX \\) provides a clear solution.\n\n**ANSWER:**  \n\\(<ANSWER> FX = 2\\sqrt{13} </ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBy brainstorming different methods\u2014coordinate geometry, vector geometry, and symmetry\u2014I identified the most efficient path. Initially, coordinate geometry seemed viable but potentially cumbersome. Vector geometry added complexity without immediate clarity. However, leveraging the symmetry and geometric properties of the hexagon led to a straightforward application of the law of cosines, yielding the correct solution efficiently.\n\nThroughout the process, regularly checking each step ensured accuracy and allowed for adjustments as needed. This step-by-step approach not only verified the correctness of the solution but also reinforced the understanding of geometric relationships within regular hexagons.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough provides clarity on how to approach such geometric problems, reflecting a natural human thought process with brainstorming, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed.",
