  "problem": "For how many integer values of $x$ is $5x^{2}+19x+16 > 20$ not satisfied?",
  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's streamline the thought process into a coherent and complete solution, preserving the natural brainstorming and checking steps but making it more concise and focused. Here's how it would look:\n\n---\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem just like how I would tackle it naturally\u2014brainstorming, trying different strategies, checking my work, and adjusting as needed.\n\n**Question:**  \nHow many integer values of \\( x \\) make the inequality \\( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 > 20 \\) **not** satisfied?\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so this looks like a quadratic inequality. My initial reaction is to identify the integer values where the inequality doesn\u2019t hold.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n- **Graphing Approach:** Visualize the parabola to see where the inequality fails.\n- **Algebraic Method:** Solve the inequality to find critical points and determine relevant intervals.\n- **Testing Integer Values Directly:** Plug in integer values to verify which ones don\u2019t satisfy the inequality.\n\nHonestly, tackling it multiple ways might ensure I\u2019m on the right track. Let's explore each strategy to see which one works best.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 1: Graphing Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nVisualizing the parabola can help identify where \\( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 \\leq 20 \\). These are the intervals I\u2019m interested in.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. **Rewrite the Inequality:**\n   \\[\n   5x^2 + 19x + 16 > 20 \\implies 5x^2 + 19x + 16 - 20 > 0 \\implies 5x^2 + 19x - 4 > 0\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   Simplifying the inequality makes it easier to handle. Now, I need to find where this quadratic is greater than zero.\n\n2. **Graph the Quadratic:**\n   - The quadratic \\( 5x^2 + 19x - 4 \\) represents a parabola opening upward (since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive).\n\n   **Challenge:**  \n   Sketching provides a rough idea, but I need exact points to determine the integer values. So, I might need to calculate the roots algebraically.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this help?  \n- **Hmm...** Sketching gives a general sense, but it's not precise enough. I need more accuracy, so let's move to an algebraic approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 2: Algebraic Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince graphing was too vague, let\u2019s solve the inequality algebraically to find the exact points where \\( 5x^2 + 19x - 4 = 0 \\). These roots will help identify the intervals.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Find the Roots of the Quadratic:**\n   \\[\n   5x^2 + 19x - 4 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n   **Brainstorming Methods:**\n   - **Factoring:** Attempting to factor might work.\n   - **Quadratic Formula:** If factoring is tough, the quadratic formula is reliable.\n\n   **Attempting to Factor:**  \n   - **Thought:** Let\u2019s see if I can find two numbers that multiply to \\( 5 \\times (-4) = -20 \\) and add to 19.\n   - **Trial:** Hmm, not seeing obvious factors.\n\n   **Reflection:**  \n   Factoring doesn\u2019t seem straightforward here. I\u2019ll use the quadratic formula.\n\n2. **Apply the Quadratic Formula:**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   - Where \\( a = 5 \\), \\( b = 19 \\), \\( c = -4 \\).\n\n   **Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   b^2 - 4ac = 19^2 - 4 \\times 5 \\times (-4) = 361 + 80 = 441\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{441} = 21\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{{-19 \\pm 21}}{10}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x_1 = \\frac{{2}}{10} = 0.2, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{{-40}}{10} = -4\n   \\]\n   \n   **Check:**  \n   Does this make sense?  \n   - **Yes,** I found two roots: \\( x = 0.2 \\) and \\( x = -4 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Intervals:**\n   - The roots divide the number line into three intervals:\n     - \\( x < -4 \\)\n     - \\( -4 \\leq x \\leq 0.2 \\)\n     - \\( x > 0.2 \\)\n   \n   **Thought:**  \n   Since the parabola opens upward, the quadratic is greater than zero outside the roots (\\( x < -4 \\) and \\( x > 0.2 \\)) and less than or equal to zero between the roots (\\( -4 \\leq x \\leq 0.2 \\)).\n\n4. **Identify Integer Values Where Inequality Is Not Satisfied:**\n   - **Inequality Not Satisfied:** \\( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 \\leq 20 \\) (i.e., \\( 5x^2 + 19x - 4 \\leq 0 \\))\n   - **Interval:** \\( -4 \\leq x \\leq 0.2 \\)\n   - **Integer Values:** \\( x = -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBefore finalizing, let's double-check by testing these integer values to ensure they indeed do not satisfy the inequality.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 3: Testing Integer Values Directly**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo confirm, I\u2019ll substitute the integer values within the interval \\( -4 \\leq x \\leq 0 \\) into the original inequality to verify they don\u2019t satisfy \\( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 > 20 \\).\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Test \\( x = -4 \\):**\n   \\[\n   5(-4)^2 + 19(-4) + 16 = 80 - 76 + 16 = 20 \\quad (\\leq 20)\n   \\]\n   **Observation:**  \n   Inequality is **not** satisfied.\n\n2. **Test \\( x = -3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   5(-3)^2 + 19(-3) + 16 = 45 - 57 + 16 = 4 \\quad (\\leq 20)\n   \\]\n   **Observation:**  \n   Inequality is **not** satisfied.\n\n3. **Test \\( x = -2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   5(-2)^2 + 19(-2) + 16 = 20 - 38 + 16 = -2 \\quad (\\leq 20)\n   \\]\n   **Observation:**  \n   Inequality is **not** satisfied.\n\n4. **Test \\( x = -1 \\):**\n   \\[\n   5(-1)^2 + 19(-1) + 16 = 5 - 19 + 16 = 2 \\quad (\\leq 20)\n   \\]\n   **Observation:**  \n   Inequality is **not** satisfied.\n\n5. **Test \\( x = 0 \\):**\n   \\[\n   5(0)^2 + 19(0) + 16 = 16 \\quad (\\leq 20)\n   \\]\n   **Observation:**  \n   Inequality is **not** satisfied.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this confirm my previous steps?  \n- **Yes,** all tested integer values within the interval \\( -4 \\leq x \\leq 0 \\) do not satisfy the inequality \\( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 > 20 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nHave I considered all possible integer values? Let\u2019s ensure there are no other integer points outside the interval \\( -4 \\leq x \\leq 0 \\) where the inequality is not satisfied.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Consider \\( x < -4 \\):**\n   - **Example:** Test \\( x = -5 \\)\n     \\[\n     5(-5)^2 + 19(-5) + 16 = 125 - 95 + 16 = 46 \\quad (> 20)\n     \\]\n   **Observation:**  \n   Inequality **is** satisfied.\n\n2. **Consider \\( x > 0 \\):**\n   - **Example:** Test \\( x = 1 \\)\n     \\[\n     5(1)^2 + 19(1) + 16 = 5 + 19 + 16 = 40 \\quad (> 20)\n     \\]\n   **Observation:**  \n   Inequality **is** satisfied.\n\n**Check:**  \nIs there any integer outside \\( -4 \\leq x \\leq 0 \\) that does not satisfy the inequality?  \n- **No,** all integers outside this interval satisfy \\( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 > 20 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014graphing, algebraic solving, and direct testing\u2014and verifying through substitution, I've identified that the inequality \\( 5x^2 + 19x + 16 > 20 \\) is **not** satisfied for the following integer values:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{x = -4, -3, -2, -1, 0}\n\\]\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\\(\\boxed{5}\\) integer values: \\( x = -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 \\)\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies:**  \n  Starting with a graphing approach provided an initial intuition, but the algebraic method gave precise critical points. Testing integer values directly served as a robust verification step.\n  \n- **Verification:**  \n  Substituting integer values ensured the solution's accuracy, confirming that only \\( x = -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 \\) do not satisfy the inequality.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Checking both within and outside the critical intervals avoided missing any integer solutions.\n\nOverall, adopting a flexible approach\u2014willing to switch strategies and verify through multiple methods\u2014ensured a correct and comprehensive solution.",
  "ground_truth": "We can simplify the inequality to $5x^{2}+19x-4 > 0$, which can then be factored into $(5x-1)(x+4)>0$. We see that this inequality is satisfied when $x<-4$ and $\\frac{1}{5}<x$, because in former case $5x-1$ and $x+4$ are both negative, and in the latter case they are both positive. This means that the inequality is not satisfied for $x$ between $-4$ and $\\frac{1}{5}$. The integer values of $x$ in this range are $-4, -3, -2, -1, \\text{ and }0$, and there are $\\boxed{5}$ of them."
