  "problem": "How many positive integers less than $101$ are multiples of either $5$ or $7$, but not both at once?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into this problem and refine my approach to create a coherent and complete solution. I'll walk through my thought process just like before, ensuring clarity and correctness while maintaining the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question asks for the number of positive integers less than 101 that are multiples of either 5 or 7, **but not both at once**.\n\n- **Initial Brainstorm:** This reminds me of problems involving multiples and possibly using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (IEP). But I'm not entirely sure if that's the best approach right off the bat. Maybe I should explore different strategies to see which one fits best.\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, the condition \"but not both at once\" seems crucial. So, I need to exclude numbers that are multiples of both 5 and 7. Hmm, multiples of both would be multiples of their least common multiple (LCM), which is 35.\n\n- **Thinking Out Loud:** So, I need to count multiples of 5 and 7, then subtract those that are multiples of 35. But before committing, let's explore a few strategies to ensure I\u2019m on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Counting Approach:**\n   - List all multiples of 5 and 7 below 101 and manually exclude those that are multiples of both.\n   \n2. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (IEP):**\n   - Use IEP to account for overlaps between multiples of 5 and 7, then subtract the overlap.\n\n3. **Alternative Method:**\n   - Count multiples of 5 but exclude those that are also multiples of 7, and vice versa.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** The direct counting method seems straightforward but might be time-consuming. IEP sounds more efficient, but I need to ensure I apply it correctly. The alternative method is intriguing; maybe it\u2019s worth exploring.\n\n---\n\n### **Starting with the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (IEP)**\n\nLet\u2019s try using the IEP since it\u2019s designed to handle cases with overlapping sets.\n\n- **IEP Formula:** \n\n  \\[\n  |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|\n  \\]\n\n  Where:\n  - \\(A\\) = multiples of 5\n  - \\(B\\) = multiples of 7\n  - \\(A \\cap B\\) = multiples of both 5 and 7 (i.e., multiples of 35)\n\n- **Thought Process:** By calculating the number of multiples of 5 and 7 separately, then subtracting those multiples of 35, I should get the total count of numbers that are multiples of either 5 or 7.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculations Using IEP**\n\n1. **Count Multiples of 5 (\\(|A|\\)):**\n   - Numbers: 5, 10, 15, ..., up to the largest multiple less than 101.\n   - **Largest Multiple:** \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 20\n     \\]\n   - **So, \\(|A| = 20\\).**\n\n2. **Count Multiples of 7 (\\(|B|\\)):**\n   - Numbers: 7, 14, 21, ..., up to the largest multiple less than 101.\n   - **Largest Multiple:** \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{7} \\right\\rfloor = 14\n     \\]\n   - **So, \\(|B| = 14\\).**\n\n3. **Count Multiples of 35 (\\(|A \\cap B|\\)):**\n   - Since 35 is the LCM of 5 and 7, these are the numbers divisible by both.\n   - Numbers: 35, 70, ..., up to the largest multiple less than 101.\n   - **Largest Multiple:** \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{35} \\right\\rfloor = 2\n     \\]\n   - **So, \\(|A \\cap B| = 2\\).**\n\n- **Applying IEP:**\n\n  \\[\n  |A \\cup B| = 20 + 14 - 2 = 32\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Wait a minute, this 32 represents the total number of multiples of either 5 or 7, including those that are multiples of both. But the question specifically asks for multiples of either 5 or 7, **but not both**. So, I need to adjust this calculation.\n\n---\n\n### **Adjusting the Approach**\n\n- **Realization:** The IEP gives me the count of numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7, **including** those that are multiples of both. However, the question requires excluding those that are multiples of both 5 and 7.\n\n- **New Strategy:** Instead of just using IEP, I need to subtract the multiples of 35 from the total obtained via IEP to satisfy the condition \"but not both at once.\"\n\n- **Thought Process:** Okay, so I need to calculate:\n\n  \\[\n  |A \\cup B| - |A \\cap B| = 32 - 2 = 30\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** Let's think about whether this makes sense. I counted 20 multiples of 5 and 14 multiples of 7, but 2 numbers are counted twice because they\u2019re multiples of both 5 and 7. Subtracting those 2 overlapping numbers should give me the correct count.\n\n- **Quick Check:** \n  - Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, ..., 100 (20 total)\n  - Multiples of 7: 7, 14, 21, ..., 98 (14 total)\n  - Overlap (multiples of 35): 35, 70 (2 total)\n  - So, \\(20 + 14 - 2 = 32\\), and then subtracting the 2 overlaps again: \\(32 - 2 = 30\\).\n\n- **Actually, wait:** That seems off because I'm subtracting the overlaps twice. Let me think this through again.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-examining the Approach**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Maybe I need to approach this differently. The IEP initially gives me the correct total of multiples of 5 or 7 **including** the overlaps. Since I already accounted for the overlaps once in the IEP, subtracting them again might be unnecessary.\n\n- **Alternative Method:** Perhaps I should directly count the numbers that are multiples of **only** 5 or **only** 7 and add them up.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Method: Counting Exclusively**\n\n1. **Multiples of 5 but Not 7 (\\(|A - B|\\)):**\n   - These are numbers divisible by 5 but **not** by 7.\n   - **Calculation:** Total multiples of 5 minus those that are multiples of both 5 and 7.\n   \n     \\[\n     |A - B| = |A| - |A \\cap B| = 20 - 2 = 18\n     \\]\n\n2. **Multiples of 7 but Not 5 (\\(|B - A|\\)):**\n   - These are numbers divisible by 7 but **not** by 5.\n   - **Calculation:** Total multiples of 7 minus those that are multiples of both 5 and 7.\n   \n     \\[\n     |B - A| = |B| - |A \\cap B| = 14 - 2 = 12\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Count:**\n\n   \\[\n   |A - B| + |B - A| = 18 + 12 = 30\n   \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:** Adding the exclusive multiples:\n  - 18 multiples of 5 that are not multiples of 7\n  - 12 multiples of 7 that are not multiples of 5\n  - Total: 30\n\n- **Reflection:** This seems more aligned with the question's requirement to exclude numbers that are multiples of both 5 and 7. I think this method is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Thought Process:** To ensure accuracy, let's list a few numbers to see if they fit the criteria.\n\n  - **Multiples of 5:** 5, 10, 15, 20, ..., 100 (20 numbers)\n  - **Multiples of 7:** 7, 14, 21, ..., 98 (14 numbers)\n  - **Multiples of Both (35):** 35, 70 (2 numbers)\n\n- **Calculating Exclusively:**\n  - **Multiples of 5 Only:** 20 - 2 = 18\n  - **Multiples of 7 Only:** 14 - 2 = 12\n  - **Total:** 18 + 12 = 30\n\n- **Random Insight:** This matches our earlier calculation using the alternative method. It seems consistent, so I feel confident about the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and adjusting the approach, the number of positive integers less than 101 that are multiples of either 5 or 7, **but not both at once**, is **30**.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Approach:** I started with the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, which led me to the total count of multiples of 5 or 7, including overlaps. However, realizing that the question required excluding overlaps, I adjusted my approach.\n\n- **Alternative Method:** By counting multiples of 5 and 7 separately and subtracting those that are multiples of both, I arrived at the correct answer.\n\n- **Reflection and Verification:** Throughout the process, I continually checked my calculations and reasoning, ensuring that the final answer aligned with the problem's requirements.\n\n- **Learning Moment:** It's essential to carefully interpret the problem's conditions (\"but not both at once\") to apply the correct mathematical principles.\n\n---\n\n<FINAL ANSWER>\n\n**30**\n\n</FINAL ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nBy revisiting and refining my approach, I've ensured that the final solution is both coherent and accurate, reflecting the thoughtful process of problem-solving.",
  "ground_truth": "There are $20$ positive multiples of $5$ less than $101$.  There are $14$ positive multiples of $7$ less than $101$.  However, the least common multiple of $5$ and $7$ is $35$, and there are $2$ positive multiples of $35$ less than $101$.  This means there are $20 - 2 = 18$ multiples of $5$ that aren't multiples of $7$, and $14 - 2 = 12$ multiples of 7 that aren't multiples of $5$, for a total of $18 + 12 = \\boxed{30}$."
