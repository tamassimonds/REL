  "solution": "Certainly! Let\u2019s craft a coherent and complete solution based on the provided working out, while preserving the final answer. I'll maintain the original thought process, reflections, and corrections to ensure authenticity and clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let\u2019s dive back into this problem. We're tasked with selecting two distinct positive integers from 1 to 50, calculating their sum \\(S\\) and product \\(P\\), and then determining the probability that \\(P + S\\) is one less than a multiple of 5.\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n- Listing all possible pairs seems overwhelming with 50 numbers.\n- Maybe there's a pattern in how \\(P + S\\) behaves modulo 5.\n- Perhaps modular arithmetic or factoring could simplify the problem.\n\nListing all pairs manually isn\u2019t feasible, so I need a more efficient method. Let me explore different strategies to see what works best.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Listing All Pairs**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf I list all distinct pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(1 \\leq a < b \\leq 50\\), I can compute \\(S = a + b\\) and \\(P = a \\times b\\) for each, then check if \\(P + S\\) is one less than a multiple of 5.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total pairs} = \\binom{50}{2} = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{2} = 1,225\n\\]\n\nWhoa, that's a lot! Listing all 1,225 pairs manually isn't feasible. I definitely need a smarter approach.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nListing all pairs is too time-consuming. I should look for patterns or use mathematical properties to simplify the problem.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Analyzing \\(P + S \\mod 5\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe I can examine how \\(P + S\\) behaves modulo 5. Since we're dealing with sums and products, modular arithmetic might help.\n\n\\[\nP + S = ab + a + b\n\\]\n\nLet me try factoring this expression:\n\n\\[\nP + S = ab + a + b + 1 - 1 = (a + 1)(b + 1) - 1\n\\]\n\nOh! This looks promising:\n\n\\[\nP + S + 1 = (a + 1)(b + 1) \\implies P + S = (a + 1)(b + 1) - 1\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(P + S\\) is one less than a multiple of 5 if \\((a + 1)(b + 1)\\) is a multiple of 5.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis transformation is helpful. I can now focus on finding pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\((a + 1)(b + 1)\\) is divisible by 5. This reduces the problem to identifying multiples of 5.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementing Strategy: Counting Favorable Outcomes**\n\n#### **Step 1: Identifying Multiples of 5**\n\nGiven \\(1 \\leq a, b \\leq 50\\), let\u2019s define:\n\n\\[\nA = a + 1,\\quad B = b + 1\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(2 \\leq A, B \\leq 51\\).\n\nI need to find pairs where \\(A \\times B\\) is a multiple of 5, i.e., either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) (or both) is a multiple of 5.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThere are 10 multiples of 5 within the range 2 to 51:\n\n\\[\n5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50\n\\]\n\nThis means there are 10 values of \\(a\\) such that \\(A = a + 1\\) is a multiple of 5.\n\n#### **Step 2: Counting Favorable Pairs**\n\nFor each \\(a\\) where \\(A\\) is a multiple of 5, I can pair it with any \\(b\\) such that \\(b \\neq a\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of valid } b = 50 - 1 = 49\n\\]\n\\[\n10 \\times 49 = 490\n\\]\n\nWait a minute\u2014this seems off. I'm only considering one direction. Let's think about it again.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nActually, looking at this again, I realize that I'm overcounting. I need to account for cases where both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are multiples of 5, which I've missed initially.\n\n#### **Step 3: Adjusting for Overlaps**\n\nTo correct this, I need to subtract the cases where both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) make \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) multiples of 5.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of such pairs } (a, b) = \\binom{10}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\nHmm, let me double-check my reasoning here. Each of these pairs is counted twice (once as \\((a, b)\\) and once as \\((b, a)\\)), but since \\(a \\neq b\\), I need to ensure I'm not overcounting.\n\n\\[\n\\text{So, total favorable pairs } = 490 - 45 = 445\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that can't be right because I've only considered one set of overlaps. I need to account for all distinct pairs correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Correcting the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI see where I went wrong\u2014my initial counting method didn't accurately capture all favorable pairs. I need to reconsider how I'm counting the pairs to avoid overcounting and ensure accuracy.\n\n#### **Alternative Strategy: Using Complementary Counting**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe it's better to count the total number of pairs where \\((a + 1)(b + 1)\\) is **not** a multiple of 5 and subtract from the total.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach might simplify things by focusing on the unfavorable cases and then finding the favorable ones through subtraction.\n\n#### **Step 1: Counting Unfavorable Pairs**\n\nFirst, let's identify how many pairs \\((a, b)\\) have \\((a + 1)(b + 1)\\) **not** divisible by 5.\n\nSince there are 10 multiples of 5 within 1 to 50, there are \\(50 - 10 = 40\\) numbers where \\(a + 1\\) is **not** a multiple of 5.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Unfavorable pairs} = \\binom{40}{2} = \\frac{40 \\times 39}{2} = 780\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, there are 780 pairs where \\((a + 1)(b + 1)\\) is not a multiple of 5.\n\n#### **Step 2: Calculating Favorable Pairs**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable pairs} = \\text{Total pairs} - \\text{Unfavorable pairs} = 1,225 - 780 = 445\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems more accurate. By counting the unfavorable cases and subtracting from the total, I've accounted for all possible pairs correctly.\n\n#### **Step 3: Calculating Probability**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{445}{1,225} = \\frac{445 \\div 5}{1,225 \\div 5} = \\frac{89}{245}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow, the probability simplifies neatly to \\(\\frac{89}{245}\\), which makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure correctness, let's briefly verify each step:\n\n- **Total Pairs:** \\(\\binom{50}{2} = 1,225\\)\u2014correct.\n- **Multiples of 5:** 10 numbers where \\(a + 1\\) is a multiple of 5\u2014correct.\n- **Unfavorable Pairs:** \\(\\binom{40}{2} = 780\\)\u2014correct.\n- **Favorable Pairs:** \\(1,225 - 780 = 445\\)\u2014correct.\n- **Probability:** \\(\\frac{445}{1,225} = \\frac{89}{245}\\)\u2014correct.\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBy revisiting my approach and applying complementary counting, I arrived at the correct probability.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution Statement**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\n\\[\n\\text{The probability that } P + S \\text{ is one less than a multiple of 5 is } \\frac{89}{245}.\n\\]\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy initially attempting to count favorable pairs directly, I realized I was overcounting and missing some overlaps. Switching to complementary counting allowed me to accurately determine the number of favorable pairs by subtracting the unfavorable ones from the total.\n\nThis experience highlights the importance of being flexible in problem-solving\u2014recognizing when an approach isn't working and being willing to explore alternative strategies. Checking each step along the way ensures that the final answer is correct.\n\nIf we make an error, like miscounting overlapping pairs, revisiting our logic and recalculating helps catch and correct it. This thorough, step-by-step approach ensures a reliable solution.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThrough exploring different strategies, recognizing and correcting errors, and validating each step, we've determined that the probability is \\(\\frac{89}{245}\\). This structured approach not only leads to the correct answer but also enhances our understanding of problem-solving techniques.\n\n**Final Answer:** \n\n\\[\n\\frac{89}{245}\n\\]\n\nBy maintaining the integrity of the original working out while enhancing clarity and coherence, we've successfully arrived at the correct probability.",
  "ground_truth": "There are a total of $\\binom{50}{2}=1225$ ways to choose the two positive integers.  Call these integers $a$ and $b$.  The problem asks what the probability is that: $$ab+a+b=n-1$$where $n$ is a multiple of 5.  We can add one to each side of this equation and factor: $$ab+a+b+1=(a+1)(b+1)=n$$Now, we need to count the number of values of $a$ and $b$ such that $(a+1)(b+1)$ is a multiple of 5.  This will happen if at least one of the factors is a multiple of 5, which will mean $a$ or $b$ is one less than a multiple of 5.\n\nThere are 10 integers from 1 to 50 inclusive that are 1 less than a multiple of 5: $4,9,14, \\dots, 49$.  So, the number of ways to choose $a$ and $b$ so the product is $\\textit{not}$ a multiple of 5 is $\\binom{40}{2}=780$.  Therefore, there are $1225-780=445$ ways to choose $a$ and $b$ that do satisfy the requirement, which gives a probability of: $$\\frac{445}{1225}=\\boxed{\\frac{89}{245}}$$"
