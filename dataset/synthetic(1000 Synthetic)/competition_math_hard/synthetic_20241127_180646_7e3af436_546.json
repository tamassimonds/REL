  "problem": "When a certain biased coin is flipped five times, the probability of getting heads exactly once is not equal to $0$ and is the same as that of getting heads exactly twice.

  "solution": "Certainly! Let's transform the initial working out into a polished, coherent solution while maintaining the original thought process and reflections. Here's how it would look:\n\n---\n\n## **Understanding the Question**\n\nWe're given a biased coin flipped five times. The probabilities of getting heads exactly once and exactly twice are equal. Our goal is to find the probability of getting heads exactly three times and compute \\( i + j \\) from the reduced fraction \\(\\frac{i}{j}\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nThis problem involves binomial probabilities with an unknown probability of heads (\\( p \\)). By setting up equations based on the given conditions, we can solve for \\( p \\) and then determine the required probability.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Setting Up the Binomial Probability Equations**\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**  \n- **Use Binomial Probability Formula:**  \n  Calculate probabilities for exactly one and two heads in terms of \\( p \\), set them equal, and solve for \\( p \\).\n  \n- **Symmetry Consideration:**  \n  Explore if symmetry in the binomial distribution can simplify the problem.\n\n**Chosen Approach:**  \nLet's start with the **Binomial Probability Formula**, as it directly relates to the given conditions.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFor exactly one head:\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly 1 head}) = \\binom{5}{1} p (1-p)^4\n\\]\n\nFor exactly two heads:\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly 2 heads}) = \\binom{5}{2} p^2 (1-p)^3\n\\]\n\nGiven that these probabilities are equal:\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{1} p (1-p)^4 = \\binom{5}{2} p^2 (1-p)^3\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n\\(\\binom{5}{1} = 5\\) and \\(\\binom{5}{2} = 10\\). Substituting these values:\n\\[\n5p(1-p)^4 = 10p^2(1-p)^3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth sides contain \\( p \\) and \\( (1-p) \\), so we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\( p(1-p)^3 \\), assuming \\( p \\neq 0 \\) and \\( p \\neq 1 \\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Simplifying the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nDivide both sides by \\( p(1-p)^3 \\):\n\\[\n5(1-p) = 10p\n\\]\n\n**Just Checking:**  \nThis simplification looks correct\u2014now we have a straightforward linear equation.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Solving for \\( p \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nRearrange the equation to solve for \\( p \\):\n\\[\n5 - 5p = 10p \\\\\n5 = 15p \\\\\np = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n\\(\\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) makes sense. So, the probability of getting heads is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis value is plausible for a biased coin. The approach seems correct so far.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Calculating Probability for Exactly Three Heads**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, use the binomial probability formula for exactly three heads:\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly 3 heads}) = \\binom{5}{3} p^3 (1-p)^2\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( p = \\frac{1}{3} \\):\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly 3 heads}) = \\binom{5}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\(\\binom{5}{3} = 10\\)  \n\\[\nP = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{27} \\times \\frac{4}{9} = 10 \\times \\frac{4}{243} = \\frac{40}{243}\n\\]\n\n**Just Checking:**  \n\\(\\frac{40}{243}\\) is in its lowest terms since 40 and 243 have no common factors other than 1.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe probability value seems reasonable. The calculations confirm that the approach is working correctly.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Determining \\( i + j \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFrom the probability \\(\\frac{40}{243}\\), identify:\n\\[\ni = 40, \\quad j = 243\n\\]\nTherefore:\n\\[\ni + j = 40 + 243 = 283\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nAdding 40 and 243 indeed gives 283. Everything checks out.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe final computation is straightforward, and the result is consistent with the preceding steps.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n\\(\\boxed{283}\\)\n\n---\n\n## **Summary and Final Check**\n\nThroughout the process:\n\n- **Brainstormed Different Strategies:**  \n  Initially considered multiple approaches and settled on the binomial probability formula as the most effective method.\n\n- **Set Up and Simplified Equations:**  \n  Carefully established equations based on given probabilities and simplified them step-by-step to solve for \\( p \\).\n\n- **Validated Each Step:**  \n  Continuously checked each calculation to ensure correctness, making adjustments as needed.\n\n- **Final Computation:**  \n  Accurately computed the desired probability and summed the components to find the final answer.\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nBy methodically working through each step and regularly validating the approach, the correct answer was confidently attained, ensuring accuracy throughout the problem-solving process.\n\n---\n\nI hope this transformation provides a clear and comprehensive solution while maintaining the original problem-solving journey.",
  "ground_truth": "Denote the probability of getting a heads in one flip of the biased coin as $h$. Based upon the problem, note that ${5\\choose1}(h)^1(1-h)^4 = {5\\choose2}(h)^2(1-h)^3$. After canceling out terms, we get $1 - h = 2h$, so $h = \\frac{1}{3}$. The answer we are looking for is ${5\\choose3}(h)^3(1-h)^2 = 10\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{40}{243}$, so $i+j=40+243=\\boxed{283}$."
