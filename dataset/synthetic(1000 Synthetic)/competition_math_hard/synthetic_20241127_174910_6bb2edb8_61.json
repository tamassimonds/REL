  "solution": "### **First Impressions**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. The sum involves logarithms with different bases, which can be tricky. At first glance, it reminds me of problems involving telescoping series or logarithmic identities. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to tackle it right away. Maybe exploring a few strategies will help clarify the path forward.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Telescoping Series:**  \n   Perhaps the series telescopes, meaning that terms cancel out, leaving only a few components. This approach often works with sums involving logs.\n\n2. **Logarithmic Identities:**  \n   Using properties of logarithms to simplify the expression. For example, converting logs to a common base might help.\n\n3. **Changing Bases:**  \n   Since there are multiple log bases involved, changing all logs to a single base could simplify the expression.\n\n4. **Numerical Evaluation:**  \n   Checking a few terms manually to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nI think I'll start by exploring the **telescoping series** idea, as it seems promising for sums like this.\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Telescoping Series**\n\nLet me attempt to express the given sum in a way that might telescope. The original sum is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=2}^{63} \\log_2\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k}\\right) \\log_k 2 \\log_{k+1} 2\n\\]\n\nHmm, let's try to rewrite each term using logarithmic identities to see if terms cancel out.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nMaybe I can express \\(\\log_k 2\\) and \\(\\log_{k+1} 2\\) in terms of base 2, since the other log is already in base 2.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, that might complicate things further. Changing all logs to the same base could help, but it doesn't necessarily lead to telescoping. Perhaps I need a different approach.\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Logarithmic Identities**\n\nLet's consider using the change of base formula:\n\n\\[\n\\log_k 2 = \\frac{\\log_2 2}{\\log_2 k} = \\frac{1}{\\log_2 k}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{k+1} 2 = \\frac{1}{\\log_2 (k+1)}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the original sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=2}^{63} \\log_2\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\log_2 k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\log_2 (k+1)}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis makes the expression more uniform in terms of base 2 logs. Maybe I can simplify further.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nActually, this looks like it might lead somewhere. By having all terms in base 2, I might be able to simplify or identify a pattern.\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying Each Term**\n\nLet's focus on simplifying \\(\\log_2\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k}\\right)\\). Using the property of logs:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k}\\right) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{k + 1}{k}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo each term becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log_2\\left(\\frac{k + 1}{k}\\right)}{\\log_2 k \\cdot \\log_2 (k+1)}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis still looks complicated. Maybe there's a way to factor or cancel terms, but it's not immediately obvious.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, I'm not seeing a clear path to telescoping here. Perhaps the telescoping series idea isn't the best approach. Let's pause and consider a different strategy.\n\n### **Step 4: Trying a Different Approach - Factorization**\n\nMaybe I can factor the expression differently to see if terms cancel out. Let's attempt to rewrite the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{k + 1}{k}\\right) = \\log_2 (k + 1) - \\log_2 k\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log_2 (k + 1) - \\log_2 k}{\\log_2 k \\cdot \\log_2 (k+1)}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis resembles a difference of logs, which might simplify the expression.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nActually, this is promising. The numerator is a difference of logs, which might lead to simplification.\n\n### **Step 5: Simplifying the Expression**\n\nLet's split the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log_2 (k + 1)}{\\log_2 k \\cdot \\log_2 (k+1)} - \\frac{\\log_2 k}{\\log_2 k \\cdot \\log_2 (k+1)}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\log_2 k} - \\frac{1}{\\log_2 (k+1)}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis is a classic telescoping series form! The terms should cancel out when summed.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nYes, this looks correct. The series should telescope, leaving only the first and last terms.\n\n### **Step 6: Writing the Sum as a Telescoping Series**\n\nNow, the sum becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=2}^{63} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\log_2 k} - \\frac{1}{\\log_2 (k+1)} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIn a telescoping series, most intermediate terms cancel out. Let's write out the first few terms to verify.\n\n**Check:**  \n- For \\(k = 2\\):  \n  \\(\\frac{1}{\\log_2 2} - \\frac{1}{\\log_2 3} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\log_2 3}\\)\n\n- For \\(k = 3\\):  \n  \\(\\frac{1}{\\log_2 3} - \\frac{1}{\\log_2 4} = \\frac{1}{\\log_2 3} - \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nAdding these:\n\n\\[\n\\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\log_2 3} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\log_2 3} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe terms are indeed canceling out as expected. This confirms that the series telescopes.\n\n### **Step 7: Summing the Remaining Terms**\n\nAfter cancellation, only the first and last terms remain:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{1}{\\log_2 64}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWait, let me double-check the limits. The last term corresponds to \\(k = 63\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\log_2 64} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(64 = 2^6\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nYup, that makes sense. So the final sum is:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\n\n### **Step 8: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's verify the solution by considering the overall approach:\n\n- **Telescoping Series:**  \n  The series was transformed into a telescoping form where most terms canceled out, leaving only the first and last terms.\n\n- **Final Calculation:**  \n  The remaining terms were straightforward to compute, leading to the final answer.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nDoes this align with the initial intuition? Yes, the telescoping series approach worked effectively after simplifying the expression.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe solution seems correct. However, it's always good to double-check by evaluating a few terms manually, as done earlier.\n\n### **Step 9: Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and confirming through simplification and verification, the final solution is:\n\n\\(<ANSWER> \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ solution} </ANSWER>\\)\n\n\\(<ANSWER> \\frac{5}{6} </ANSWER>\\)\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nI'm glad I started with the telescoping series idea, even though it wasn't immediately obvious. By simplifying the expression step by step and verifying along the way, I was able to confirm that the approach was correct. It's essential to remain flexible and open to changing strategies when the initial path isn't clear. Checking work at each stage helps ensure accuracy and build confidence in the solution.\n        \n        Please put it together into a coherent and complete solution. Don't change the final answer.",
