  "solution": "Alright, let's dive in and refine this solution to make it more cohesive and natural. We'll maintain the original thought process while enhancing clarity and coherence. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. The equation given is \\( V = IZ \\), where:\n\n- \\( V \\) is voltage,\n- \\( I \\) is current (what we need to find),\n- \\( Z \\) is impedance.\n\nWe're given:\n\\[ V = 1 - i \\]\n\\[ Z = 1 + 3i \\]\n\nOur task is to find \\( I \\) in the form \\( a + bi \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Brainstorming**\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Divide Both Sides by \\( Z \\):** Since \\( I = \\frac{V}{Z} \\), we can directly compute \\( I \\) by dividing \\( V \\) by \\( Z \\).\n   \n2. **Use Complex Conjugates:** To simplify the division of complex numbers, multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator might help.\n   \n3. **Alternative Methods:** Maybe expressing in polar form, but that seems unnecessary here.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDividing \\( V \\) by \\( Z \\) using the complex conjugate seems the most straightforward and reliable method. Let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expressing \\( I \\) in Terms of \\( V \\) and \\( Z \\)**\n\nStarting with the given equation:\n\\[ V = IZ \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( I \\):\n\\[ I = \\frac{V}{Z} \\]\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThis makes sense. By dividing both sides by \\( Z \\), we directly solve for \\( I \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Plugging in the Given Values**\n\nSubstituting the given complex numbers:\n\\[ I = \\frac{1 - i}{1 + 3i} \\]\n\n**Checking:**  \nDoes this setup look correct? Yes, we've plugged in \\( V \\) and \\( Z \\) appropriately.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Division Using Complex Conjugates**\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nDividing complex numbers directly can be tricky. Let's multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to simplify.\n\n- **Conjugate of \\( Z \\):**  \n  For \\( Z = 1 + 3i \\), its conjugate is \\( 1 - 3i \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nMultiplying by the conjugate should eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator, making it easier to handle.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Multiplying Numerator and Denominator by the Conjugate**\n\nSet up the expression:\n\\[ I = \\frac{(1 - i) \\cdot (1 - 3i)}{(1 + 3i) \\cdot (1 - 3i)} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoes this look right? Yes, by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by \\( 1 - 3i \\), we're preserving the equality.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Simplifying the Denominator**\n\nLet's tackle the denominator first:\n\\[ (1 + 3i)(1 - 3i) \\]\n\nUsing the difference of squares formula:\n\\[ 1^2 - (3i)^2 = 1 - 9(-1) = 1 + 9 = 10 \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nIs the denominator a real number now? Yes, it's 10. Perfect!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Simplifying the Numerator**\n\nNow, let's expand the numerator:\n\\[ (1 - i)(1 - 3i) \\]\n\nUsing the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\n- **First:**  \n  \\( 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\)\n  \n- **Outer:**  \n  \\( 1 \\times (-3i) = -3i \\)\n  \n- **Inner:**  \n  \\( -i \\times 1 = -i \\)\n  \n- **Last:**  \n  \\( -i \\times (-3i) = 3i^2 \\)\n\nSo, adding these up:\n\\[ 1 - 3i - i + 3i^2 \\]\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nWait, \\( i^2 \\) is equal to \\( -1 \\). Let's substitute that in.\n\n\\[ 3i^2 = 3(-1) = -3 \\]\n\nNow, combine the terms:\n\\[ 1 - 3i - i - 3 = (1 - 3) + (-3i - i) = -2 - 4i \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this simplification make sense? Yes, all steps follow the basic arithmetic rules for complex numbers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Writing the Simplified Expression for \\( I \\)**\n\nNow, we have:\n\\[ I = \\frac{-2 - 4i}{10} \\]\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nLet's split this fraction to express \\( I \\) in the standard \\( a + bi \\) form.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Splitting the Fraction**\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{-2}{10} + \\frac{-4i}{10} \\]\n\nSimplifying each part:\n\\[ I = -0.2 - 0.4i \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this look correct? Yes, both the real and imaginary parts are properly simplified.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoes the final answer make sense? Let's do a quick check:\n\n- **Magnitude Check:**  \n  The impedance \\( Z \\) had a larger imaginary part, so it's reasonable that the current \\( I \\) has both real and imaginary components reduced.\n  \n- **Direction Check:**  \n  No signs of errors in the steps; each operation followed logically from the previous one.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nEverything seems to align correctly. The approach was straightforward, and the calculations confirm the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Conclusion: Solution</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\\[ I = -0.2 - 0.4i \\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nBy carefully applying the concept of dividing complex numbers and using conjugates, we arrived at the solution systematically. Regular checks ensured that each step was correct, leading us confidently to the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Putting It All Together**\n\nAlright, let's wrap it up neatly:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**  \n   We need to find the current \\( I \\) given \\( V = 1 - i \\) and \\( Z = 1 + 3i \\) using \\( V = IZ \\).\n\n2. **Choosing the Strategy:**  \n   We'll solve for \\( I \\) by dividing \\( V \\) by \\( Z \\), utilizing complex conjugates to simplify the division.\n\n3. **Executing the Steps:**  \n   - Express \\( I = \\frac{V}{Z} = \\frac{1 - i}{1 + 3i} \\).\n   - Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of \\( Z \\):  \n     \\( I = \\frac{(1 - i)(1 - 3i)}{(1 + 3i)(1 - 3i)} \\).\n   - Simplify the denominator:  \n     \\( 10 \\).\n   - Expand and simplify the numerator:  \n     \\( -2 - 4i \\).\n   - Combine into final form:  \n     \\( I = -0.2 - 0.4i \\).\n\n4. **Final Reflection:**  \n   The solution makes sense both mathematically and conceptually, ensuring accuracy at each step.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBy methodically applying complex number division techniques and verifying each step, we confidently arrived at the current \\( I = -0.2 - 0.4i \\).",
