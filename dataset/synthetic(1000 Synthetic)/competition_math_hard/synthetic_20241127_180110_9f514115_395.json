  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll approach it just like I would if I were solving it on paper, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming and First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I see that it's about finding the maximal area of a cross-section of a prism that's been cut by a plane. Here's what immediately comes to mind:\n\n- **Prism Specifications:** The prism has vertical edges parallel to the \\( z \\)-axis and a square cross-section with side length 10. This implies it's a **rectangular prism**.\n\n- **Plane Equation:** The cutting plane is given by \\( 4x - 7y + 4z = 25 \\). I recall that a plane can intersect a prism in various ways, possibly creating different shapes.\n\n- **Maximal Cross-Section:** This suggests that the plane's intersection with the prism can vary, and we need to find the orientation that maximizes the area of the resulting cross-section.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- **How does a plane cutting through a prism create different areas?** Maybe the angle of the plane relative to the prism affects the size of the cross-section.\n\n- **This reminds me of problems involving optimizing areas using calculus or geometric transformations.** Perhaps we need to find the plane's orientation that maximizes the cross-section area.\n\n- **I'm unsure where to start,** but exploring the relationship between the plane and the prism's dimensions might help.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Geometric Interpretation**\n\n**Idea:** Visualize how the plane cuts through the prism and determine the shape and area of the cross-section.\n\n**First Steps:**\n\n- **Visualizing the Cut:** Since the prism has a square cross-section and vertical edges, the plane could intersect it in various shapes like rectangles or parallelograms.\n\n- **Thinking Out Loud:** **But wait,** if the plane isn't parallel to any axis, the cross-section might be more complex. Could it be an irregular quadrilateral?\n\n- **Actually,** this reminds me of slicing a cube with a plane\u2014sometimes the cross-section is a square, other times a rectangle or parallelogram.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is this approach leading me anywhere?** Not really, because visualizing alone doesn't provide a concrete method to calculate the maximal area.\n\n- **Maybe I need to back up and try a different strategy.**\n\n**Outcome:** **This strategy isn't sufficient.** I need more than just visualization to find the exact maximal area.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Analytical Geometry**\n\n**Idea:** Use the equation of the plane and the geometry of the prism to calculate the area of the cross-section.\n\n**First Steps:**\n\n- **Plane Equation:** Given \\( 4x - 7y + 4z = 25 \\), I can rearrange it to express \\( z \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):  \n  \\[\n  z = \\frac{25 - 4x + 7y}{4}\n  \\]\n\n- **Thinking:** **Hmm,** this gives me the \\( z \\)-coordinate of any point on the plane based on \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). \n\n- **Considering the Prism's Boundaries:** The prism has a square cross-section with side length 10. Let's assume the square lies in the \\( xy \\)-plane, centered at the origin, so the vertices are at \\((\\pm5, \\pm5)\\).\n\n- **Checking:** **Wait a minute,** the Asymptote code shows the vertices differently: \\((\\pm1, \\pm1)\\). **Actually,** this indicates that the side length is 2 in the code. **Maybe** there's a discrepancy between the description and the code.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Which one should I trust?** To avoid confusion, I'll stick with the description that specifies a side length of 10.\n\n- **Do I need to adjust the coordinates accordingly?** Yes, the vertices should be at \\((\\pm5, \\pm5)\\).\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- **Determine Points of Intersection:** Find where the plane intersects the edges of the prism.\n\n- **Calculating Intersection Points:** For edges parallel to the \\( z \\)-axis, the plane will intersect at points where \\( z \\) satisfies the plane's equation.\n\n- **Thinking:** **But wait,** calculating all intersection points manually might be cumbersome. **Is there a better way?** \n\n**Alternative Approach:** **Maybe** using vector geometry or transforming the coordinate system could simplify the problem.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Coordinate Transformation**\n\n**Idea:** Rotate the coordinate system so that the plane becomes horizontal, simplifying the calculation of the cross-section area.\n\n**First Steps:**\n\n- **Vector Normal to the Plane:** The plane's normal vector is \\( \\langle 4, -7, 4 \\rangle \\).\n\n- **Considering Rotation:** By rotating the coordinate system such that the \\( z' \\)-axis aligns with the plane's normal, the plane equation simplifies.\n\n- **Actually,** this reminds me of using **orthogonal transformations** to simplify plane equations.\n\n**Thinking:** **Hmm,** transforming coordinates can be tricky, but it might make the problem easier by aligning the plane with one of the axes.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is this approach feasible?** Yes, but it requires dealing with rotation matrices and transforming the prism accordingly.\n\n- **Do I feel comfortable with this method?** **Not entirely,** as it might complicate the calculations more than necessary.\n\n**Outcome:** **This strategy could work, but it's not the most straightforward.** Let's consider another approach that might be simpler.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 4: Projecting the Cross-Section onto a Plane**\n\n**Idea:** Project the cross-section onto a plane where its area is maximized.\n\n**First Steps:**\n\n- **Understanding Projections:** The area of the cross-section can be maximized by projecting it onto a plane perpendicular to the cutting plane.\n\n- **Mathematically,** this involves finding the area of the projection by considering the angle between the cutting plane and the plane of projection.\n\n**Thinking:** **Oh! This reminds me of using the cosine of the angle between planes to relate areas.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, maximizing the projected area aligns with maximizing the actual cross-section area.\n\n- **Is this a valid approach?** **Absolutely,** it leverages geometric properties to simplify the problem.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- **Calculate the Angle Between Planes:** Find the angle between the cutting plane and the horizontal plane.\n\n- **Use the Cosine of the Angle:** The maximal area of the cross-section is the area of the base square divided by the cosine of the angle.\n\n**Checking:** **Does this approach align with the problem's requirements?** Yes, it provides a direct method to find the maximal area.\n\n**Outcome:** **This strategy seems promising.** Let's proceed with it.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementing Strategy 4: Projecting the Cross-Section onto a Plane**\n\n#### **Step 1: Determine the Angle Between the Cutting Plane and the Horizontal Plane**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **The cutting plane is \\( 4x - 7y + 4z = 25 \\).** I need to find the angle between this plane and the horizontal plane (\\( z = 0 \\)).\n\n- **Actually,** the angle can be found using the normal vectors of the planes.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Normal Vector of the Cutting Plane:** \\( \\mathbf{n_1} = \\langle 4, -7, 4 \\rangle \\)\n\n- **Normal Vector of the Horizontal Plane:** \\( \\mathbf{n_2} = \\langle 0, 0, 1 \\rangle \\)\n\n- **Angle \\( \\theta \\) Between the Planes:**  \n  \\[\n  \\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\mathbf{n_1} \\cdot \\mathbf{n_2}}{\\|\\mathbf{n_1}\\| \\|\\mathbf{n_2}\\|}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculating Dot Product:**  \n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{n_1} \\cdot \\mathbf{n_2} = 4 \\times 0 + (-7) \\times 0 + 4 \\times 1 = 4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculating Magnitudes:**  \n  \\[\n  \\|\\mathbf{n_1}\\| = \\sqrt{4^2 + (-7)^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 49 + 16} = \\sqrt{81} = 9\n  \\]\n  \n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{n_2}\\| = \\sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} = 1\n\\]\n  \n- **Cosine of the Angle:**  \n  \\[\n  \\cos \\theta = \\frac{4}{9 \\times 1} = \\frac{4}{9}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this result make sense?** Yes, the cosine value is between 0 and 1, indicating a valid angle.\n\n- **Is my calculation correct?** **Absolutely,** the steps align with the mathematical formula.\n\n**Outcome:** **The angle between the cutting plane and the horizontal plane is such that \\( \\cos \\theta = \\frac{4}{9} \\).**\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Calculate the Maximal Cross-Section Area**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **The maximal area of the cross-section is the area of the square divided by \\( \\cos \\theta \\).**\n\n- **Wait, why divide by \\( \\cos \\theta \\)?** **Because** projecting the area onto a plane perpendicular to the cutting plane accounts for the inclination.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Area of the Base Square:**  \n  \\[\n  A_{\\text{square}} = 10 \\times 10 = 100\n  \\]\n  \n- **Maximal Cross-Section Area \\( A_{\\max} \\):**  \n  \\[\n  A_{\\max} = \\frac{A_{\\text{square}}}{\\cos \\theta} = \\frac{100}{\\frac{4}{9}} = 100 \\times \\frac{9}{4} = 225\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does dividing by \\( \\cos \\theta \\) increase the area?** Yes, since \\( \\cos \\theta < 1 \\), the maximal area is greater than the base square's area.\n\n- **Is this consistent with geometric intuition?** **Absolutely,** inclining the plane increases the cross-section area.\n\n- **Is my calculation correct?**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{100}{\\frac{4}{9}} = 100 \\times \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{900}{4} = 225\n  \\]\n  \n  **Yes,** the calculations are correct.\n\n**Outcome:** **The maximal area of the cross-section is \\( 225 \\) square units.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nPutting it all together, after exploring various strategies and verifying the correctness of each step, the **maximal area of the cross-section** is:\n\n\\(<\\text{ANSWER}>225\\text{ square units}</\\text{ANSWER}>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion and Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout the problem-solving process, I started by brainstorming different strategies, including geometric visualization, analytical geometry, coordinate transformation, and projection. By reflecting on each approach's effectiveness and adjusting as needed, I arrived at the most straightforward and accurate method: projecting the cross-section onto a plane perpendicular to the cutting plane.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Initial Visualization:** Helped in understanding the problem but needed more concrete methods for calculation.\n\n- **Analytical Geometry:** Provided a way to relate the plane equation to the prism's dimensions but was cumbersome.\n\n- **Coordinate Transformation:** Possible but complicated the problem unnecessarily.\n\n- **Projection Approach:** Simplified the problem by directly relating the cross-section area to the plane's inclination, leading to an accurate and efficient solution.\n\n**Final Check:** All calculations align with geometric principles, and the final answer is consistent with the problem's requirements. The maximal cross-section area is **225 square units**, confirming the correctness of the chosen strategy.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**\n\nBy systematically exploring and evaluating different strategies, I was able to identify the most effective approach to solve the problem. Reflecting on each step ensured that the solution was both accurate and efficient, ultimately leading to the correct maximal cross-section area of 225 square units.",
