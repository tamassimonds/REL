  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, reflecting and checking my work along the way. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Question\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with two numbers chosen independently from the set of integers \\( \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\} \\). We need to find the probability that the sum of these two numbers is less than their product.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- This reminds me of probability problems involving summing and multiplying numbers.\n- Maybe I can list all possible pairs and check each one?\n- Or perhaps there\u2019s a mathematical inequality I can use to simplify things?\n- I'm not entirely sure which method is best, so I'll explore a few strategies.\n\n---\n\n### Exploring Different Strategies\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Listing All Possible Pairs**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- There are only five numbers, so the total number of pairs is manageable.\n- I can list all pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in \\( \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\} \\).\n- For each pair, check if the sum is less than the product.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Total Possible Pairs:**\n   - Since both numbers are chosen independently: \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) pairs.\n\n2. **Listing Pairs and Checking the Inequality \\(a + b < a \\times b\\):**\n\n   Let\u2019s create a table to keep track:\n\n   | Pair \\((a, b)\\) | Sum \\(a + b\\) | Product \\(a \\times b\\) | \\(a + b < a \\times b\\)?

\n\n**Checking for Overcounting:**\n\n- Since each pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a \\neq b\\) has a corresponding \\((b, a)\\), I might be double-counting.\n\n- Let's reconsider the counting to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Revised Counting:**\n\n- **Unique Favorable Pairs (counting each ordered pair separately):**\n  - (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)\n  - (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)\n  - (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)\n  - (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)\n\n- **Total Favorable Outcomes:** 15 (as initially counted)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- It seems the initial count was correct because each ordered pair is distinct.\n- The probability remains \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Using Mathematical Inequality**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Maybe there's a general inequality that can simplify the problem.\n- The inequality \\(a + b < a \\times b\\) can be rewritten as \\(a + b - ab < 0\\).\n- Rearranging gives: \\(ab - a - b > 0\\).\n- Adding 1 to both sides: \\(ab - a - b + 1 > 1\\).\n- Factoring: \\((a - 1)(b - 1) > 1\\).\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n- This inequality suggests that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) need to be greater than 1 for the product to exceed the sum.\n\n**Applying the Inequality:**\n\n- So, any pair \\((a, b)\\) where both numbers are greater than 1 should satisfy the inequality.\n- However, let's verify this by listing such pairs.\n\n**Listing Pairs Where \\(a, b > 1\\):**\n\n- (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)\n- (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)\n- (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)\n- (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)\n\n**Total Favorable Outcomes:**\n\n- **Counting Unique Ordered Pairs:** 15\n\n**Probability:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{sum} < \\text{product}) = \\frac{15}{25} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Both strategies lead to the same probability.\n- This consistency strengthens the confidence in the solution.\n\n---\n\n### Final Check and Conclusion\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Before finalizing, let's ensure that all pairs have been correctly accounted for.\n- Double-check that no pairs have been missed or incorrectly evaluated.\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\n- Total pairs: 25\n- Favorable pairs: 15\n- Probability \\( \\frac{15}{25} = \\frac{3}{5} \\), which simplifies correctly.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Listing all pairs and applying the inequality both agree on the probability.\n- The approach is thorough, and the probability is validated through multiple methods.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Thoughts\n\n- At first, I considered listing all pairs, which worked well given the small set size.\n- The mathematical inequality provided a deeper understanding and confirmed the results.\n- Ensuring no double-counting was crucial in maintaining accuracy.\n- Multiple strategies leading to the same outcome enhance confidence in the solution.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n- The probability that the sum of the two numbers is less than their product is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n\n---\n\nThat's the complete walkthrough, reflecting my natural thought process, including brainstorming, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed.",
  "ground_truth": "Let's name the two numbers $a$ and $b.$ We want the probability that $ab>a+b,$ or $(a-1)(b-1)>1$ using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick. This inequality is satisfied if and only if $a\\neq 1$ or $b\\neq 1$ or $a \\neq 2 \\neq b$.  There are a total of $16$ combinations such that $a \\neq 1$ and $b \\neq 1$.  Then, we subtract one to account for $(2,2)$, which yields $15$ total combinations out of a total of 25, for a probability of $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$"
