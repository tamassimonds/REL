The question asks for the value of \\( k \\) such that the vertical line \\( x = k \\) intersects the parabola \\( x = -2y^2 - 3y + 5 \\) at exactly one point.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a problem involving parabolas and lines. I remember dealing with similar scenarios where a line intersects a curve at one point, indicating tangency.

Let's see where that leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation**\n\nI'll substitute \\( x = k \\) into the parabola's equation:\n\n\\[\nk = -2y^2 - 3y + 5\n\\]\n\n- **Thought Process:** This creates a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\). Solving this will tell us the \\( y \\)-coordinates where the line intersects the parabola.\n\n- **Reflection:** If there's exactly one point of intersection, it means this quadratic has exactly one real solution. That reminds me of the condition involving the discriminant.\n\nAlright, let's move on to solving this quadratic equation for \\( y \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Rearranging the Equation**\n\nFirst, I'll rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\n-2y^2 - 3y + (5 - k) = 0\n\\]\n\n- **Check:** Yup, this looks like a standard quadratic \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\) with:\n  - \\( a = -2 \\)\n  - \\( b = -3 \\)\n  - \\( c = 5 - k \\)\n\n- **Thoughts:** Now, I need to ensure that this quadratic has exactly one real solution. Time to recall the condition for that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Discriminant**\n\nFor a quadratic equation \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\), there\u2019s exactly one real solution when the discriminant is zero:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 0\n\\]\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  b^2 = (-3)^2 = 9\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  4ac = 4 \\times (-2) \\times (5 - k) = -8(5 - k) = -40 + 8k\n  \\]\n  \n  So,\n  \\[\n  \\Delta = 9 - (-40 + 8k) = 9 + 40 - 8k = 49 - 8k\n  \\]\n\n- **Equation:** Set the discriminant to zero:\n  \\[\n  49 - 8k = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **Solving for \\( k \\):**\n  \\[\n  49 = 8k \\implies k = \\frac{49}{8}\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Okay, I found \\( k = \\frac{49}{8} \\). But wait\u2014let me think about whether this makes sense. Do I trust this result, or should I verify it somehow?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\nIt's always good to double-check. I\u2019ll plug \\( k = \\frac{49}{8} \\) back into the original setup and see if it holds.\n\n- **Substitution:** Replace \\( k \\) in the quadratic equation:\n  \\[\n  -2y^2 - 3y + \\left(5 - \\frac{49}{8}\\right) = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  Calculate the constant term:\n  \\[\n  5 = \\frac{40}{8} \\implies 5 - \\frac{49}{8} = \\frac{40 - 49}{8} = -\\frac{9}{8}\n  \\]\n  \n  So the equation becomes:\n  \\[\n  -2y^2 - 3y - \\frac{9}{8} = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplifying:** Multiply through by 8 to clear the fraction:\n  \\[\n  -16y^2 - 24y - 9 = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **Checking Discriminant Again:**\n  \\[\n  b^2 = (-24)^2 = 576\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  4ac = 4 \\times (-16) \\times (-9) = 576\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\Delta = 576 - 576 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion:** Yup, the discriminant is zero, confirming that there's exactly one real solution.
