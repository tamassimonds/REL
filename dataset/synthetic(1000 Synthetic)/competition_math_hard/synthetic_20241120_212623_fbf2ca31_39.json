I'll brainstorm various strategies, reflect on each step, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **Problem Recap**\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of:\n\n\\[\n|z - 1 + 2i|^2 + |z - 9 - 4i|^2\n\\]\n\ngiven that \\( z \\) is a complex number satisfying:\n\n\\[\n|z - 5 - i| = 5\n\\]\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so \\( z \\) lies on a circle centered at \\( 5 + i \\) with a radius of 5. The expression we need to minimize involves the sum of the squares of the distances from \\( z \\) to two other fixed points: \\( 1 - 2i \\) and \\( 9 + 4i \\).\n\nThis reminds me of **geometry problems involving circles and points**, specifically **the Fermat Point** or techniques involving **vectors and projections**. But I'm not entirely sure which would be the most straightforward here. Let's explore a few strategies.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Geometric Interpretation:**  \n   Visualize the points and the circle. Perhaps the minimum occurs at a specific geometric location like the point where the circle's tangents touch lines connecting the fixed points.\n\n2. **Algebraic Approach:**  \n   Express \\( z \\) in terms of its real and imaginary parts, then use calculus to find the minimum of the given expression under the circle's constraint.\n\n3. **Use of Complex Numbers:**  \n   Utilize properties of complex numbers, perhaps leveraging the concept of the **exponential form** or **rotation** to simplify the expressions.\n\n4. **Projected Distances:**  \n   Consider projecting the points onto specific lines or using the **law of cosines** to relate the distances.\n\nHmm, **Strategy 2: Algebraic Approach** seems promising because it provides a clear pathway with calculus to find the minimum. But it might get messy. **Strategy 1: Geometric Interpretation** is appealing for its visual clarity. Let's start with the geometric approach and see where it leads.\n\n### **Step 1: Geometric Interpretation**\n\nLet's map out the points:\n\n- Center of the circle: \\( C = 5 + i \\)\n- Radius: \\( r = 5 \\)\n- Points to minimize distances from:\n  - \\( A = 1 - 2i \\)\n  - \\( B = 9 + 4i \\)\n\nSo, \\( z \\) lies on the circle centered at \\( C \\) with radius 5. The expression we need to minimize is the sum of the squares of distances from \\( z \\) to \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIs there a known geometric property that can help here? Perhaps something involving **isogonal conjugates** or the **Erd\u0151s\u2013Mordell inequality**, but those might be overcomplicated for this problem. Let's try to visualize it.\n\nI can imagine that the minimum might occur at a point on the circle that's strategically located relative to \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). Maybe where the circle is closest to the line connecting \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n**But wait**, is this the most efficient path? Maybe there's a better way. Let's pause and consider the algebraic approach as well.\n\n### **Step 2: Algebraic Approach**\n\nLet's express \\( z \\) as \\( z = x + yi \\). The given condition becomes:\n\n\\[\n|z - 5 - i| = 5 \\implies |(x - 5) + (y - 1)i| = 5\n\\]\n\nThis translates to:\n\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nOkay, this is the equation of a circle. Now, the expression to minimize is:\n\n\\[\n|z - 1 + 2i|^2 + |z - 9 - 4i|^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding these:\n\n\\[\n|z - (1 - 2i)|^2 = (x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n|z - (9 + 4i)|^2 = (x - 9)^2 + (y - 4)^2\n\\]\n\nSo, we need to minimize:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 + (x - 9)^2 + (y - 4)^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks manageable. We have a constraint and an objective function. We can use Lagrange multipliers or substitute the constraint directly to express one variable in terms of the other.\n\nBut before diving into calculus, let's see if there's a simpler angle.\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Expression**\n\nNotice that the expression to minimize is the sum of squared distances from \\( z \\) to two fixed points. Perhaps we can find the **centroid** or some other strategic point between them.\n\n**Idea:**  \nThe centroid \\( M \\) of points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is:\n\n\\[\nM = \\left( \\frac{1 + 9}{2}, \\frac{-2 + 4}{2} \\right) = (5, 1)\n\\]\n\n**Interesting!**  \nThe centroid coincides with the center of the circle \\( C \\). This might be significant.\n\n**Insight:**  \nWhen the center of the circle is the same as the centroid of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), the point \\( z \\) on the circle closest to both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) might be directly related to these positions.\n\nBut how do we formalize this?\n\n### **Step 4: Leveraging the Centroid**\n\nGiven that \\( M = C \\), the circle is centered exactly at the midpoint between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). This symmetry suggests that the minimum sum of squared distances could occur at points aligned along the line connecting \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nPerhaps the minimum occurs where the line through \\( M \\) perpendicular to \\( AB \\) intersects the circle. But since \\( M = C \\), this line is just the vertical line through the center.\n\n**But wait**, is this the right path? Maybe there's another property we can use.\n\n### **Step 5: Another Geometric Insight**\n\nConsider that the sum of squares of distances can be minimized by looking at the projection of \\( z \\) onto the line \\( AB \\).\n\n**Projection Approach:**  \nLet's project \\( z \\) onto \\( AB \\) and see if that helps.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nThe vector from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) is:\n\n\\[\nB - A = (9 - 1) + (4 - (-2))i = 8 + 6i\n\\]\n\nThe unit vector along \\( AB \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8 + 6i}{\\sqrt{8^2 + 6^2}} = \\frac{8 + 6i}{10} = 0.8 + 0.6i\n\\]\n\nNow, project \\( z \\) onto \\( AB \\):\n\n\\[\nz_{\\text{proj}} = A + \\left( \\frac{z - A}{B - A} \\right)(B - A)\n\\]\n\nBut this seems to complicate things. Perhaps projection isn't the best approach.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nMaybe projections are introducing unnecessary complexity. Let's return to the algebraic approach and see it through.\n\n### **Step 6: Continuing with Algebraic Approach**\n\nWe have the constraint:\n\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\nAnd we want to minimize:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 + (x - 9)^2 + (y - 4)^2\n\\]\n\nLet's expand the expression to minimize:\n\n\\[\n= (x^2 - 2x + 1) + (y^2 + 4y + 4) + (x^2 - 18x + 81) + (y^2 - 8y + 16)\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[\n= 2x^2 - 20x + 82 + 2y^2 - 4y + 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the objective function is:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 + 2y^2 - 20x - 4y + 102\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks like a quadratic function. We can attempt to complete the square or use calculus to find its minimum under the given constraint.\n\nBut before proceeding further, let's check if there's a more straightforward method we might have overlooked.\n\n### **Step 7: Exploring an Alternative Method**\n\nLet's consider **Strategy 3: Use of Complex Numbers**. Perhaps expressing the distances in terms of complex magnitudes will help.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n|z - 5 - i| = 5\n\\]\n\\[\n|z - 1 + 2i|^2 + |z - 9 - 4i|^2 = ?\n\\]\n\n**Idea:**  \nMaybe we can express \\( z \\) in terms of an angle, considering its position on the circle.\n\nLet:\n\n\\[\nz = 5 + i + 5e^{i\\theta}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\theta \\) is the angle parameterizing the circle.\n\nNow, let's express the distances:\n\n\\[\n|z - 1 + 2i|^2 = |(4 + (1 - 2i)) + 5e^{i\\theta}|^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= |4 - 1 + 2i + 5e^{i\\theta}|^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= |3 + 2i + 5e^{i\\theta}|^2\n\\]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[\n|z - 9 - 4i|^2 = |(-4 + (-3 - 4i)) + 5e^{i\\theta}|^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= |-4 - 3 - 4i + 5e^{i\\theta}|^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= |-7 - 4i + 5e^{i\\theta}|^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems to complicate things further. Maybe expressing \\( z \\) in terms of \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) isn't simplifying the problem as much as I'd hoped.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nPerhaps the algebraic approach was the better path. Let's return to it and proceed methodically.\n\n### **Step 8: Solving Algebraically**\n\nWe need to minimize:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 + 2y^2 - 20x - 4y + 102\n\\]\n\nSubject to:\n\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\n**Idea:**  \nUse the constraint to express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\), then substitute into the objective function to minimize it with respect to \\( x \\).\n\nFrom the constraint:\n\n\\[\n(y - 1)^2 = 25 - (x - 5)^2\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - (x - 5)^2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis introduces a square root, which might complicate differentiation. However, it's necessary to satisfy the constraint. Let's proceed.\n\nSubstitute \\( y \\) into the objective function:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = 2x^2 + 2(1 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - (x - 5)^2})^2 - 20x - 4(1 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - (x - 5)^2}) + 102\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis expression is quite complex. Differentiating it to find critical points would be cumbersome. Is there a better way?\n\n**Alternative Idea:**  \nMaybe we can use a trigonometric substitution to simplify the constraint. Let\u2019s try that.\n\n### **Step 9: Trigonometric Substitution**\n\nLet\u2019s parametrize the circle using trigonometric functions.\n\nLet:\n\n\\[\nx - 5 = 5 \\cos \\theta\n\\]\n\\[\ny - 1 = 5 \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nx = 5 + 5 \\cos \\theta\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 1 + 5 \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis substitution should simplify the objective function. Let's express the objective in terms of \\( \\theta \\).\n\nFirst, compute \\( (x - 1) \\) and \\( (y + 2) \\):\n\n\\[\nx - 1 = 4 + 5 \\cos \\theta\n\\]\n\\[\ny + 2 = 3 + 5 \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[\nx - 9 = -4 + 5 \\cos \\theta\n\\]\n\\[\ny - 4 = -3 + 5 \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nNow, the objective function becomes:\n\n\\[\n|z - 1 + 2i|^2 + |z - 9 - 4i|^2 \n\\]\n\\[\n= (4 + 5 \\cos \\theta)^2 + (3 + 5 \\sin \\theta)^2 + (-4 + 5 \\cos \\theta)^2 + (-3 + 5 \\sin \\theta)^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet's simplify this expression.\n\n### **Step 10: Simplifying the Objective Function**\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1. \\( (4 + 5 \\cos \\theta)^2 + (3 + 5 \\sin \\theta)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n= 16 + 40 \\cos \\theta + 25 \\cos^2 \\theta + 9 + 30 \\sin \\theta + 25 \\sin^2 \\theta\n\\]\n\\[\n= 25 \\cos^2 \\theta + 25 \\sin^2 \\theta + 40 \\cos \\theta + 30 \\sin \\theta + 25\n\\]\n\\[\n= 25(1) + 40 \\cos \\theta + 30 \\sin \\theta + 25\n\\]\n\\[\n= 50 + 40 \\cos \\theta + 30 \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\n2. \\( (-4 + 5 \\cos \\theta)^2 + (-3 + 5 \\sin \\theta)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n= 16 - 40 \\cos \\theta + 25 \\cos^2 \\theta + 9 - 30 \\sin \\theta + 25 \\sin^2 \\theta\n\\]\n\\[\n= 25 \\cos^2 \\theta + 25 \\sin^2 \\theta - 40 \\cos \\theta - 30 \\sin \\theta + 25\n\\]\n\\[\n= 50 - 40 \\cos \\theta - 30 \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nNow, adding both:\n\n\\[\n50 + 40 \\cos \\theta + 30 \\sin \\theta + 50 - 40 \\cos \\theta - 30 \\sin \\theta = 100\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWow, that's an interesting result! The terms involving \\( \\cos \\theta \\) and \\( \\sin \\theta \\) cancel out, leaving us with a constant value of 100.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe sum of the squared distances is **always** 100, regardless of the position of \\( z \\) on the circle. Therefore, the minimum value is **100**.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAt first, I considered multiple strategies, including geometric interpretations and algebraic approaches. The algebraic approach seemed promising but looked messy initially. However, by using trigonometric substitution, the problem simplified beautifully, revealing that the expression to minimize is constant. This might not have been immediately obvious, but reflecting on the symmetry and carefully simplifying the expressions led to this elegant conclusion.\n\n**Brainstorming and Reflection Recap:**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Considered geometric and algebraic methods. The geometric approach wasn't straightforward, so shifted to algebraic.\n- **Algebraic Approach:** Started expanding expressions, but it seemed complex. Trigonometric substitution was introduced to simplify.\n- **Trigonometric Substitution:** Simplified the problem significantly, leading to cancellation of variable terms.\n- **Final Check:** Ensured all terms were accounted for and confirmed that the minimum value is constant at 100.\n\nThis process highlights the importance of being flexible with strategies and not hesitating to switch approaches when one path becomes cumbersome. Embracing different perspectives can lead to elegant solutions in seemingly complex problems.",
