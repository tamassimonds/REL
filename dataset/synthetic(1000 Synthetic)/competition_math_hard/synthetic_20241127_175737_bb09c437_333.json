  "solution": "Certainly! Let's streamline the thought process into a clear and concise solution while maintaining the original reflection and problem-solving steps.  \n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nWe're asked to determine how many integers \\( n \\) (where \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 100 \\)) make the fraction \\(\\frac{n}{n+1}\\) a repeating decimal.\n\n**First Thought:**  \nThis involves fractions and repeating decimals. I recall that repeating decimals are linked to the prime factors of the denominator. Specifically, if the denominator has prime factors other than 2 and 5, the decimal representation is repeating.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Exploring with Examples:**  \n   Test a few values of \\( n \\) to identify patterns.\n\n2. **Recalling Decimal Properties:**  \n   A fraction has a terminating decimal if its denominator (after simplification) contains only the prime factors 2 and 5.\n\n3. **Focusing on \\( n+1 \\):**  \n   Since the denominator is \\( n+1 \\), analyze its prime factors.\n\n**Chosen Strategy:**  \nStart with examples to verify if the pattern holds, then generalize.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring with Examples**\n\nLet's compute \\(\\frac{n}{n+1}\\) for a few \\( n \\):\n\n- **For \\( n = 1 \\):**  \n  \\(\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\\) (terminating)\n\n- **For \\( n = 2 \\):**  \n  \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666...\\) (repeating)\n\n- **For \\( n = 3 \\):**  \n  \\(\\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\\) (terminating)\n\n- **For \\( n = 4 \\):**  \n  \\(\\frac{4}{5} = 0.8\\) (terminating)\n\n- **For \\( n = 5 \\):**  \n  \\(\\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.833...\\) (repeating)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIt seems that when \\( n+1 \\) is a power of 2 or 5, the decimal terminates. Otherwise, it repeats. This aligns with the properties of fractions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying the Pattern**\n\nFrom the examples:\n\n- **Terminating Decimals:**  \n  Occur when \\( n+1 \\) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\n- **Repeating Decimals:**  \n  Occur when \\( n+1 \\) includes prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTo find repeating decimals, we need to identify integers \\( n \\) where \\( n+1 \\) has prime factors beyond 2 and 5.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Translating the Idea into a Strategy**\n\n**Alternative Strategies Considered:**\n\n- **List All \\( n \\) with Terminating Decimals:**  \n  Identify all \\( n \\) where \\( n+1 \\) is a product of only 2s and 5s, then subtract from 100 to find repeating cases.\n\n**Preferred Strategy:**  \nCount all \\( n+1 \\) up to 101 that are powers or products of 2 and 5, then determine the corresponding \\( n \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Implementing the Strategy**\n\n**Listing \\( n+1 \\) as Powers and Products of 2 and 5:**\n\n- **Powers of 2 up to 101:**  \n  \\( 2^1 = 2 \\),  \n  \\( 2^2 = 4 \\),  \n  \\( 2^3 = 8 \\),  \n  \\( 2^4 = 16 \\),  \n  \\( 2^5 = 32 \\),  \n  \\( 2^6 = 64 \\),  \n  \\( 2^7 = 128 \\) (exceeds 101, so stop)\n\n- **Powers of 5 up to 101:**  \n  \\( 5^1 = 5 \\),  \n  \\( 5^2 = 25 \\),  \n  \\( 5^3 = 125 \\) (exceeds 101, so stop)\n\n- **Products of 2 and 5 up to 101:**  \n  \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\),  \n  \\( 2^2 \\times 5 = 20 \\),  \n  \\( 2^3 \\times 5 = 40 \\),  \n  \\( 2^4 \\times 5 = 80 \\),  \n  \\( 2 \\times 5^2 = 50 \\),  \n  \\( 2^2 \\times 5^2 = 100 \\)\n\n**Listing All \\( n+1 \\):**  \n\\[ 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 5, 25, 10, 20, 40, 80, 50, 100 \\]\n\n**Corresponding \\( n \\):**  \nSubtracting 1 from each:  \n\\[ 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 4, 24, 9, 19, 39, 79, 49, 99 \\]\n\n**Total Count:**  \n14 such \\( n \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Double-Checking the List**\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **No Duplicates:**  \n  All listed \\( n+1 \\) are distinct.\n\n- **No Missing Combinations:**  \n  Higher powers and relevant products are included up to 101.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe list is complete and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Calculating the Final Answer**\n\n**Total \\( n \\):**  \n100\n\n**Terminating Decimals \\( n \\):**  \n14\n\n**Repeating Decimals \\( n \\):**  \n\\[ 100 - 14 = 86 \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThere are 86 integers \\( n \\) such that \\(\\frac{n}{n+1}\\) is a repeating decimal for \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 100 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Reflection**\n\n**Does it Make Sense?**  \nYes, subtracting the terminating cases from the total gives the repeating cases.\n\n**Alternative Verification:**  \nConsider using the properties of numbers or Euler\u2019s Totient function, but the current method is straightforward and logical.\n\n**Confidence in Solution:**  \nThe approach is validated through examples and thorough listing, ensuring accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER> solution\nThere are 86 integers \\( n \\) such that \\(\\frac{n}{n+1}\\) is a repeating decimal for \\(1 \\leq n \\leq 100\\).\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Closing Thoughts**\n\nBy starting with examples, identifying patterns, and systematically listing relevant cases, we arrived at the correct solution. Reflection and verification at each step ensured the approach was accurate and complete.\n\n\u2015\n\nI've reformulated the insights from the initial working to produce a concise, structured solution. By maintaining the original brainstorming and reflection elements, the revised response articulates a clear problem-solving journey, leading seamlessly to the correct answer.",
  "ground_truth": "Note that $n+1$ and $n$ will never share any common factors except for $1$, because they are consecutive integers. Therefore, $n/(n+1)$ is already simplified, for all positive integers $n$.\n\nSince $1 \\le n \\le 100$, it follows that $2 \\le n+1 \\le 101$. Recall that a simplified fraction has a repeating decimal representation if and only if its denominator is divisible by a prime other than 2 and 5. The numbers between 2 and 101 which are divisible only by 2 and 5 comprise the set $\\{2, 4, 5, 8, \\allowbreak 10, 16, 20, 25, \\allowbreak 32, 40, 50, 64, \\allowbreak 80, 100\\}$. Therefore, there are $14$ terminating decimals and $100 - 14 = \\boxed{86}$ repeating decimals."
