  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem by refining the original approach, ensuring clarity and coherence while maintaining the correctness of the final answer. I'll walk through the thought process step-by-step, reflecting and adjusting strategies along the way to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, it reminds me of nested function scenarios where applying a function repeatedly leads to a specific condition. The goal is to find the smallest number \\( a > 1 \\) such that \\( f(2) = f^a(2) \\).\n\n1. **Initial Idea:** Start by applying the function \\( f \\) to 2 repeatedly and see what unfolds.\n\n2. **Alternative Approach:** Look for patterns or cycles in the function's behavior to possibly identify repeating sequences.\n\n3. **Another Strategy:** Analyze how the function transforms numbers, especially considering multiples of 3 and 7.\n\nI'm not entirely sure which method will be most efficient, so I'll begin with the straightforward approach: applying the function step-by-step and observing any patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Function \\( f(x) \\)**\n\nBefore diving in, let's really grasp how \\( f(x) \\) operates:\n\n\\[ \nf(x) = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\frac{x}{21} & \\text{if } x \\text{ is a multiple of both 3 and 7}, \\\\\n3x & \\text{if } x \\text{ is only a multiple of 7}, \\\\\n7x & \\text{if } x \\text{ is only a multiple of 3}, \\\\\nx + 3 & \\text{if } x \\text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7}.\n\\end{cases} \n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Since 2 is neither a multiple of 3 nor 7, the last condition applies:\n\n\\[ \nf(2) = 2 + 3 = 5 \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Adding 3 to 2 makes sense here. So, \\( f(2) = 5 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Function Repeatedly**\n\nNow, I need to find \\( f^a(2) \\) such that \\( f(2) = f^a(2) \\), meaning \\( f^a(2) = 5 \\). Let's apply \\( f \\) to 5 and continue this process.\n\n**Next Thought:** I'll keep applying \\( f \\) until I either return to 5 or notice a repeating cycle.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\( f(5) \\)**\n\nIs 5 a multiple of 3 or 7? \n\n**Reflection:** No, it's not.\n\n\\[ \nf(5) = 5 + 3 = 8 \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Adding 3 to 5 gives 8. That seems right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating \\( f(8) \\)**\n\nIs 8 a multiple of 3 or 7?\n\n**Reflection:** No, it's not.\n\n\\[ \nf(8) = 8 + 3 = 11 \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Adding 3 to 8 gives 11. Looks good so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating \\( f(11) \\)**\n\nIs 11 a multiple of 3 or 7?\n\n**Reflection:** No.\n\n\\[ \nf(11) = 11 + 3 = 14 \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** 11 plus 3 is 14. Okay, moving on.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating \\( f(14) \\)**\n\nIs 14 a multiple of 7?\n\n**Reflection:** Yes, but not a multiple of 3.\n\nAccording to the function:\n\n\\[ \nf(14) = 3 \\times 14 = 42 \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** 3 times 14 is 42. That seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Calculating \\( f(42) \\)**\n\nIs 42 a multiple of both 3 and 7?\n\n**Reflection:** Yes, because \\( 42 = 3 \\times 14 \\) and 14 is a multiple of 7.\n\nAccording to the function:\n\n\\[ \nf(42) = \\frac{42}{21} = 2 \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Dividing 42 by 21 gives 2. That works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Observing the Cycle**\n\nSo far, we've seen:\n\n- \\( f(2) = 5 \\)\n- \\( f(5) = 8 \\)\n- \\( f(8) = 11 \\)\n- \\( f(11) = 14 \\)\n- \\( f(14) = 42 \\)\n- \\( f(42) = 2 \\)\n\n**Insight:** Wait a minute! After applying \\( f \\) to 42, we return to 2. This suggests a cycle:\n\n\\[ \n2 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 11 \\rightarrow 14 \\rightarrow 42 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow \\ldots \n\\]\n\n**Thought:** Since \\( f(2) = 5 \\), and we've established a cycle, I need to find the smallest \\( a > 1 \\) such that \\( f^a(2) = 5 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Determining \\( a \\)**\n\nFrom the cycle, let's track how many applications it takes to return to 5:\n\n1. \\( f(2) = 5 \\)\n2. \\( f^2(2) = f(5) = 8 \\)\n3. \\( f^3(2) = f(8) = 11 \\)\n4. \\( f^4(2) = f(11) = 14 \\)\n5. \\( f^5(2) = f(14) = 42 \\)\n6. \\( f^6(2) = f(42) = 2 \\)\n7. \\( f^7(2) = f(2) = 5 \\)\n\n**Conclusion:** It takes 7 applications to return to 5, so \\( a = 7 \\).\n\n**Wait a Second:** But the problem asks for the smallest \\( a > 1 \\) such that \\( f(2) = f^a(2) \\). Looking back, after 6 steps, \\( f^6(2) = 2 \\), and then \\( f^7(2) = 5 \\). So, the correct answer is actually \\( a = 7 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Verifying the Cycle**\n\nJust to be sure, let's verify the entire cycle again:\n\n- **\\( f(2) = 5 \\):** Already confirmed.\n- **\\( f(5) = 8 \\):** Confirmed.\n- **\\( f(8) = 11 \\):** Confirmed.\n- **\\( f(11) = 14 \\):** Confirmed.\n- **\\( f(14) = 42 \\):** Confirmed.\n- **\\( f(42) = 2 \\):** Confirmed.\n- **\\( f^7(2) = f(2) = 5 \\):** Confirmed.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Answer**\n\nThe smallest value of \\( a \\) greater than 1 that satisfies \\( f(2) = f^a(2) \\) is **7**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection: Learning from the Process**\n\n- **Initial Thoughts:** Starting with applying the function step-by-step was an effective approach. It allowed me to naturally observe the cycle.\n\n- **Realization:** Identifying the cycle was crucial. Once I saw the repeating pattern, determining \\( a \\) became straightforward.\n\n- **Verification:** Verifying each step ensured that there were no miscalculations. Double-checking is essential, especially with cyclical patterns.\n\n- **Final Check:** Reassessing the entire cycle confirmed the correctness of the answer.\n\n**Overall:** Approaching the problem methodically, checking each step, and being open to adjusting the strategy ensured an accurate solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought**\n\nBy systematically applying the function and observing the resulting cycle, I was able to determine the correct value of \\( a \\). This methodical approach not only led to the correct answer but also reinforced the importance of verifying each step in problem-solving.\n\n**<ANSWER>7</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\nI hope this revised solution effectively communicates the problem-solving process, ensuring that the final answer remains correct while enhancing clarity and coherence.",
  "ground_truth": "Since 2 is not a multiple of 3 or 7, $f(2)=2+3=5$ and we want to find an $a$ where $f^a(2)=5$. So, we keep track of how many times we evaluate $f$ of our previous result until we get 5.  \\begin{align*}\nf(2)&=5\\\\\nf(f(2))&=f(5)=5+3=8 \\qquad 5 \\text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\\\\\nf(f(f(2)))&=f(8)=8+3=11 \\qquad 8 \\text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\\\\\nf^4(2)&=11+3=14 \\qquad 11 \\text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\\\\\nf^5(2)&=3\\cdot14=42 \\qquad 14 \\text{ is a multiple of 7.}\\\\\nf^6(2)&=\\frac{42}{21}=2 \\qquad 42 \\text{ is a multiple of 3 and 7.}\\\\\nf^7(2)&=2+3=5 \\qquad 2 \\text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\n\\end{align*}So the least $a>1$ for which $f^a(2)=f(2)$ is $a=\\boxed{7}$."
