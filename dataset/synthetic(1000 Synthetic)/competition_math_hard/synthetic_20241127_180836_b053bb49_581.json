  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. I'll approach it just like I would if I were solving it on paper, exploring different strategies, reflecting along the way, and checking for correctness. Here's how I would naturally work through it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, the problem involves finding the real values of \\( b \\) for which the quadratic \\( x^2 + bx + 9 \\) has two non-real roots. This reminds me of dealing with the **discriminant** of a quadratic equation, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the only way. Let me brainstorm a bit.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Use the Discriminant:** I remember that the discriminant tells us about the nature of the roots. Maybe I can use that.\n  2. **Complete the Square:** Another method to analyze quadratics, but it might be more involved.\n  3. **Graphical Interpretation:** Thinking about how the parabola behaves could give insights.\n\nI think starting with the **discriminant** is the most straightforward. If that doesn't work, I'll explore other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant \\( \\Delta \\) of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\n- **Thought Process:** If \\( \\Delta < 0 \\), the roots are non-real (complex). Since the problem asks for two non-real roots, this condition should apply.\n\n- **Applying to Our Quadratic:**\n  - Here, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = b \\) (same as in the equation), and \\( c = 9 \\).\n  - So, the discriminant becomes:\n\n    \\[\n    \\Delta = b^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 9 = b^2 - 36\n    \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Okay, so for the roots to be non-real, I need \\( b^2 - 36 < 0 \\). Let's solve this inequality to find \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Inequality \\( b^2 - 36 < 0 \\)**\n\n- **Initial Thoughts:** I need to find the values of \\( b \\) that make this expression negative. This looks like a simple quadratic inequality.\n\n- **Breaking It Down:**\n  1. **Rewrite the Inequality:**\n\n     \\[\n     b^2 < 36\n     \\]\n\n  2. **Take Square Roots:**\n\n     \\[\n     -6 < b < 6\n     \\]\n\n     - **Check:** Taking the square root of both sides makes sense because squaring any real number \\( b \\) will give a positive result less than 36 only if \\( b \\) is between -6 and 6.\n\n- **Reflection:** This seems correct. So, \\( b \\) must lie within this interval for the roots to be non-real.\n\n- **But Wait:** Let me think\u2014does this account for all cases? Yes, because outside this interval, \\( b^2 \\) would be 36 or greater, making the discriminant zero or positive, leading to real roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Let's consider extreme cases to ensure the solution is valid.\n\n  - **If \\( b = 0 \\):**\n    - \\( b^2 - 36 = 0 - 36 = -36 \\)\n    - Discriminant is negative \u2192 Two non-real roots. \u2705\n\n  - **If \\( b = 6 \\) or \\( b = -6 \\):**\n    - \\( b^2 - 36 = 36 - 36 = 0 \\)\n    - Discriminant is zero \u2192 Two real and identical roots. \u274c\n    - **Conclusion:** \\( b \\) must be strictly between -6 and 6, not including -6 and 6.\n\n- **Thought Process:** This aligns with our earlier solution \\( -6 < b < 6 \\). So, the interval is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\((-6, 6)\\)\n\n- **Interpretation:** All real values of \\( b \\) within the open interval \\((-6, 6)\\) will ensure that the quadratic \\( x^2 + bx + 9 \\) has two non-real roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing the discriminant and solving the corresponding inequality, we've determined that \\( b \\) must lie strictly between -6 and 6 to ensure the quadratic has two non-real roots. The initial approach using the discriminant was effective, and verification through sample values confirmed the correctness of the solution.\n\nIf I hadn't started with the discriminant or if the inequality solving raised issues, exploring alternative methods like completing the square or graphing would have been necessary. However, in this case, the initial strategy worked seamlessly.\n\n---\n\nThat's it! By carefully thinking through each step, checking along the way, and being open to changing strategies if needed, we arrived at the correct solution naturally.",
  "ground_truth": "Consider the quadratic formula $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. In order for the quadratic to have two non-real roots, the expression under the square root (the discriminant) must be negative. This gives us the inequality \\begin{align*} b^2-4ac&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad b^2-4(1)(9)&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad b^2-36&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (b+6)(b-6)&<0.\n\\end{align*} Thus, we find that $ b\\in\\boxed{(-6, 6)} $."
