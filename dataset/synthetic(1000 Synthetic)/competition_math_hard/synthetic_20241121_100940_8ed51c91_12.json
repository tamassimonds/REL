  "solution": "Alright, let's put this solution together in a clear and cohesive manner, maintaining the final answer as \\(10x \\cdot \\sqrt{21x}\\). I'll summarize the thought process while ensuring the steps flow logically, reflecting a natural problem-solving approach.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen faced with the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{75x} \\cdot \\sqrt{2x} \\cdot \\sqrt{14x}\n\\]\n\nwe need to simplify this expression into the simplest radical form in terms of \\(x\\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis involves multiplying square roots\u2014perhaps leveraging properties of radicals would be helpful. Multiple strategies come to mind:\n\n1. **Simplify Each Square Root Individually**\n2. **Combine All Under One Square Root**\n3. **Factor Out Common Terms**\n\nTo begin, let's try simplifying each square root individually. If that doesn't lead to significant simplification, we'll explore combining them under a single square root.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify Each Square Root Individually**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBy breaking down each square root, we might identify perfect squares that can be factored out, making the multiplication easier.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **\\(\\sqrt{75x}\\):**  \n   - Factor 75: \\(75 = 25 \\times 3\\), where 25 is a perfect square.\n   - Simplify:  \n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{75x} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 3 \\times x} = \\sqrt{25} \\cdot \\sqrt{3x} = 5\\sqrt{3x}\n     \\]\n\n2. **\\(\\sqrt{2x}\\):**  \n   - No perfect squares in 2, so it remains:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{2x}\n     \\]\n\n3. **\\(\\sqrt{14x}\\):**  \n   - Factor 14: \\(14 = 2 \\times 7\\), neither are perfect squares, so it remains:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{14x}\n     \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSimplifying \\(\\sqrt{75x}\\) was beneficial, but \\(\\sqrt{2x}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{14x}\\) didn't change. Multiplying these simplified forms might still be cumbersome. Perhaps there's a more efficient approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Combine All Under One Square Root**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince individual simplification didn't yield much, let's utilize the property:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{a \\cdot b}\n\\]\n\nto merge all terms under a single square root.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{75x} \\cdot \\sqrt{2x} \\cdot \\sqrt{14x} = \\sqrt{(75x) \\cdot (2x) \\cdot (14x)}\n\\]\n\n**Expanding Inside the Square Root:**\n\n\\[\n75 \\times 2 \\times 14 = 2100\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx \\cdot x \\cdot x = x^3\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2100x^3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems promising. Now, let's focus on simplifying \\(\\sqrt{2100x^3}\\) by extracting perfect squares.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplify \\(\\sqrt{2100x^3}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo simplify, identify perfect squares within 2100 and handle \\(x^3\\) appropriately under the square root.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Factorizing 2100:**  \n   - Break it down:  \n     \\[\n     2100 = 21 \\times 100 = (3 \\times 7) \\times (10^2) = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 5^2\n     \\]\n     - Here, \\(2^2 = 4\\) and \\(5^2 = 25\\) are perfect squares.\n\n2. **Identifying Perfect Squares:**  \n   - Multiplying perfect squares:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 25 = 100 = 10^2\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying the Square Root:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2100x^3} = \\sqrt{(10^2) \\times 21 \\times x^3} = \\sqrt{10^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{21} \\cdot \\sqrt{x^3} = 10 \\cdot \\sqrt{21} \\cdot \\sqrt{x^3}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplifying \\(\\sqrt{x^3}\\):**\n   \\[\n   x^3 = x^2 \\cdot x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\sqrt{x^3} = \\sqrt{x^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{x} = x \\cdot \\sqrt{x}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Putting It All Together:**\n   \\[\n   10 \\cdot \\sqrt{21} \\cdot x \\cdot \\sqrt{x} = 10x \\cdot \\sqrt{21x}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nCombining the square roots initially was indeed the right move. The simplification process flowed smoothly, leading to a neat final expression.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, it's crucial to verify each step to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n\n1. **Multiplication Inside the Square Root:**\n   \\[\n   75 \\times 2 \\times 14 = 150 \\times 14 = 2100\n   \\]\n   - Correct.\n\n2. **Factorization of 2100:**\n   \\[\n   2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 5^2 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 25 = 2100\n   \\]\n   - Correct.\n\n3. **Simplification of \\(\\sqrt{2100x^3}\\):**\n   - Extracted \\(10^2\\) as 10.\n   - Simplified \\(x^3\\) to \\(x \\cdot \\sqrt{x}\\).\n   - Combined remaining square roots appropriately.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll calculations check out, confirming that the approach and final answer are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{75x} \\cdot \\sqrt{2x} \\cdot \\sqrt{14x} = \\boxed{10x \\cdot \\sqrt{21x}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies and reflecting at each step:\n\n- **Initial Simplification:** Simplifying each square root individually only helped partially.\n- **Combining Square Roots:** Merging all terms under a single square root significantly streamlined the process.\n- **Extracting Perfect Squares:** Identifying and extracting perfect squares from the radicand facilitated further simplification.\n- **Final Verification:** Regular checks ensured accuracy throughout the solution.\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nThis step-by-step approach not only led to the correct solution but also highlighted the importance of flexibility and verification in problem-solving. Being open to adjusting strategies and continuously checking work are crucial components of effective mathematical thinking.\n\n---\n\nThere we have it\u2014a coherent and complete solution, maintaining the final answer as \\(10x \\cdot \\sqrt{21x}\\).",
