  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and present a complete, coherent solution while keeping the original thought process intact. Our goal is to find the inverse of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x-1}{x+5} \\), express it in the form \\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{ax+b}{cx+d} \\), and ultimately determine the ratio \\( \\frac{a}{c} \\).\n\nWe'll walk through the solution step by step, reflecting and verifying each part to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen faced with finding the inverse of a rational function like \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x-1}{x+5} \\), my initial instinct is to consider the **algebraic inversion method**. This involves swapping the variables \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) and then solving for \\( y \\). Although I'm slightly unsure if this is the best approach, it feels like a natural starting point. If it doesn't work out, I can always explore other strategies like cross-multiplication or even a matrix approach, but let's stick with algebraic inversion for now.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Algebraic Inversion:** Swap \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), then solve for \\( y \\).\n   \n2. **Cross-Multiplication:** Eliminate fractions to simplify the equation.\n   \n3. **Matrix Method:** Use linear algebra techniques, but this might be overkill here.\n\nGiven the problem's nature, **algebraic inversion** seems most straightforward. Let's proceed with that.\n\n### **Step 1: Set Up the Inverse**\n\n**Thought Process:** To find the inverse, I'll start by replacing \\( f(x) \\) with \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{2x - 1}{x + 5}\n\\]\n\nNext, I'll swap \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to set up the equation for the inverse:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2y - 1}{y + 5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This step looks correct. Swapping \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is standard when finding inverses.\n\n### **Step 2: Solve for \\( y \\)**\n\n**Initial Idea:** To solve for \\( y \\), I think cross-multiplying will help eliminate the denominator.\n\n\\[\nx(y + 5) = 2y - 1\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[\nxy + 5x = 2y - 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:** This seems straightforward. I've successfully removed the fraction, which simplifies the equation.\n\n### **Step 3: Rearrange the Equation**\n\n**Goal:** I need to isolate \\( y \\). I'll move all terms involving \\( y \\) to one side and constants to the other.\n\n\\[\nxy - 2y = -5x - 1\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\ny(x - 2) = -5x - 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Factoring \\( y \\) makes sense here. The equation is now set up to solve for \\( y \\).\n\n### **Step 4: Solve for \\( y \\)**\n\n**Next Step:** To isolate \\( y \\), I'll divide both sides by \\( (x - 2) \\):\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-5x - 1}{x - 2}\n\\]\n\n**Pause and Check:** Let's double-check this. Does the numerator and denominator look correct based on previous steps? Yes, everything seems to align. The fraction is correctly simplified.\n\n### **Step 5: Express the Inverse in the Desired Form**\n\n**Observation:** The inverse function is now:\n\n\\[\nf^{-1}(x) = \\frac{-5x - 1}{x - 2}\n\\]\n\nThis matches the form \\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{ax+b}{cx+d} \\), where:\n\n- \\( a = -5 \\)\n- \\( b = -1 \\)\n- \\( c = 1 \\)\n- \\( d = -2 \\)\n\n**Check:** Assigning coefficients aligns perfectly with the desired form. No inconsistencies here.\n\n### **Step 6: Calculate \\( \\frac{a}{c} \\)**\n\n**Calculation:** Given:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{-5}{1} = -5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This result seems straightforward. A negative ratio is plausible given the coefficients. Still, to ensure correctness, let's verify the inverse.\n\n### **Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Verification Strategy:** To confirm the inverse is correct, I'll compose \\( f \\) and \\( f^{-1} \\) and check if it yields the identity function \\( x \\).\n\n**Compose \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) \\):**\n\n\\[\nf\\left( \\frac{-5x - 1}{x - 2} \\right) = \\frac{2\\left( \\frac{-5x - 1}{x - 2} \\right) - 1}{\\left( \\frac{-5x - 1}{x - 2} \\right) + 5}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\frac{-10x - 2}{x - 2} - 1}{\\frac{-5x - 1}{x - 2} + 5}\n\\]\n\nCombining terms:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\frac{-10x - 2 - (x - 2)}{x - 2}}{\\frac{-5x - 1 + 5(x - 2)}{x - 2}}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\frac{-11x}{x - 2}}{\\frac{-11}{x - 2}} = x\n\\]\n\n**Verification Outcome:** The composition simplifies to \\( x \\), confirming that the inverse is correct. This reassures me that the solution is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Solution**\n\nAfter carefully working through each step and verifying the correctness of the inverse, the ratio \\( \\frac{a}{c} \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-5}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy following a structured approach\u2014starting with algebraic inversion, solving systematically, and verifying through composition\u2014I successfully found the inverse of the given function and determined \\( \\frac{a}{c} \\). Reflecting at each step ensured the process was accurate, and verifying the solution through composition reinforced the correctness of the final answer. Always remember, checking your work is as crucial as solving the problem itself.",

For this, set $(ax+b)/(cx+d)$ equal to $(5x+1)/(-x+2)$, clear denominators and note that the resulting quadratic polynomials are equal for all values of $x$ except possibly 2 and $-d/c$.  This implies that the coefficients are equal, and solving the resulting system of linear equations gives $(a,b,c,d)=(5b,b,-b,2b)$.)"
