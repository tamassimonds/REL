  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect frequently, and change course if needed. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**What's the question asking?**\n\nWe're given an arithmetic sequence: \\(1^2, x^2, 3^2, \\ldots\\), and we need to solve for \\(x > 0\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- This looks like an arithmetic sequence where each term is a perfect square.\n- I recall that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\n\n**Potential Strategies:**\n\n1. **Find the Common Difference:** Calculate the difference between the first and second terms and see if it matches the difference between the second and third terms.\n   \n2. **Set Up Equations:** Use the property of arithmetic sequences to set up equations and solve for \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Look for Patterns:** Maybe recognize a pattern in the squares that could help.\n\n**Which Strategy to Try First?**\n\nI think starting with finding the common difference is a good approach. If that doesn't work, I'll try setting up equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Common Difference**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms should be the same. Let's check if that's the case here.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- First term: \\(1^2 = 1\\)\n- Second term: \\(x^2\\)\n- Third term: \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n\nCompute the differences:\n\n- Difference between second and first term: \\(x^2 - 1\\)\n- Difference between third and second term: \\(9 - x^2\\)\n\n**Set Up an Equation:**\n\nFor the sequence to be arithmetic:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 1 = 9 - x^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that equation looks straightforward. Let's solve it to see if it makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's solve \\(x^2 - 1 = 9 - x^2\\) for \\(x\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. Add \\(x^2\\) to both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   x^2 + x^2 - 1 = 9\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   2x^2 - 1 = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. Add 1 to both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   2x^2 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 2:\n\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 5\n   \\]\n\n4. Take the square root of both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n   \n   Since \\(x > 0\\), we take the positive root.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so we found \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\). But let's do a quick check to see if this makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's verify that \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\) satisfies the condition of an arithmetic sequence.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- First term: \\(1^2 = 1\\)\n- Second term: \\((\\sqrt{5})^2 = 5\\)\n- Third term: \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n\nCompute the differences:\n\n- Difference between second and first term: \\(5 - 1 = 4\\)\n- Difference between third and second term: \\(9 - 5 = 4\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth differences are equal to 4, confirming that the sequence is indeed arithmetic with \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nThe differences are consistent, so the solution seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEven though the first strategy worked, let's briefly consider other approaches to ensure completeness.\n\n**Alternative Strategy 1: Setting Up General Equations**\n\nWe could set up a general formula for the \\(n\\)-th term and solve for \\(x\\), but since our initial approach was straightforward and successful, this might be unnecessary.\n\n**Alternative Strategy 2: Recognizing Patterns in Squares**\n\nNoticing that the sequence involves perfect squares, we could look for relationships between the terms, but again, the common difference method already provided the solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe initial strategy was efficient and correct, so no need to pursue other methods further.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(\\boxed{x = \\sqrt{5}}\\)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThrough exploring the common difference in the arithmetic sequence, setting up and solving the equation, and verifying the solution, we've confidently determined that \\(x = \\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n---\n\nThat's it! By walking through each step thoughtfully and verifying along the way, we've arrived at the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "The term $x^2$ is simply the average of $1^2 = 1$ and $3^2 = 9$, so $x^2 = (1 + 9)/2 = 5$.  Because $x > 0$, $x = \\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}$."
