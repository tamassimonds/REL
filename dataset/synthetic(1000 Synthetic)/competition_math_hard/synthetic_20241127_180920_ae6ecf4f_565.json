  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just as I would if I were tackling it myself\u2014brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, checking for correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we have 95 numbers, each either +1 or -1. We need to find the smallest possible positive value of the sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 95} a_i a_j\n\\]\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- This looks like a combinatorial problem involving pairwise products.\n- Reminds me of problems involving sums of products and parity.\n- Maybe it relates to balancing the number of +1s and -1s?\n- Could symmetry play a role here?\n\nI'm not entirely sure which direction to take yet, so let's explore different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **1. Calculating the Sum Explicitly**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If each \\( a_i \\) is either +1 or -1, then \\( a_i a_j \\) will be either +1 (if both are the same) or -1 (if they're different).\n- Perhaps I can compute the sum for specific cases to see a pattern.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- With 95 numbers, that's \\(\\binom{95}{2} = 4,465\\) pairs. Too many to compute manually.\n- Maybe start with smaller cases to detect a pattern.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- This approach might give insight, but it's not feasible for large \\( n \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Hmm, this isn't practical.** I need a better strategy.\n\n#### **2. Using the Formula for Expanding Sums**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I remember that \\(\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i\\right)^2\\) involves all pairwise products.\n- Let's see if expanding this helps.\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i\\right)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 95} a_i a_j\n\\]\n\n- Since each \\( a_i^2 = 1 \\), the first term is 95.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i\\right)^2 = 95 + 2 \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 95} a_i a_j\n\\]\n\nRearranging,\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 95} a_i a_j = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i\\right)^2 - 95\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Oh, this is interesting!** Now, if I can control \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \\), I can find the desired sum.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- This seems correct. Let's proceed with it.\n\n#### **3. Minimizing the Sum Through \\( S \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let \\( S = \\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \\).\n- The expression becomes \\( \\frac{1}{2} (S^2 - 95) \\).\n- I need to find the smallest positive value of this expression.\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n- Since each \\( a_i \\) is \\(\\pm 1\\), \\( S \\) can range from -95 to +95.\n- **Wait, but** \\( S \\) must be odd because 95 is odd, and the sum of an odd number of \\(\\pm 1\\)s is odd.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Hmm, important insight!** \\( S \\) must be odd.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- So, \\( S \\) can be -95, -93, ..., 1, ..., 93, 95.\n\n#### **4. Calculating \\( S^2 - 95 \\) for Odd \\( S \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I need \\( S^2 - 95 \\) to be positive and as small as possible.\n- Let's compute \\( S^2 \\) for small positive odd \\( S \\).\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n- \\( S = 1 \\): \\( S^2 = 1 \\rightarrow 1 - 95 = -94 \\) (negative)\n- \\( S = 3 \\): \\( S^2 = 9 \\rightarrow 9 - 95 = -86 \\) (negative)\n- \\( S = 5 \\): \\( S^2 = 25 \\rightarrow 25 - 95 = -70 \\) (negative)\n- ...\n- Keep increasing \\( S \\) until \\( S^2 - 95 \\) becomes positive.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **This might take a while,** but it's necessary to find the smallest positive value.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Let's compute further to find the exact \\( S \\).\n\n#### **5. Finding the Smallest \\( S \\) with \\( S^2 - 95 > 0 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I need to find the smallest odd \\( S \\) such that \\( S^2 > 95 \\).\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n- \\( S = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 \\): All yield negative \\( S^2 - 95 \\).\n- \\( S = 13 \\): \n  \\[\n  S^2 = 169 \\rightarrow 169 - 95 = 74 \\rightarrow \\frac{74}{2} = 37\n  \\]\n- So, \\( \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 95} a_i a_j = 37 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Oh, I see!** \\( S = 13 \\) is the smallest odd \\( S \\) where \\( S^2 - 95 \\) is positive.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Let's verify if \\( S = 13 \\) is achievable with 95 numbers.\n\n#### **6. Verifying \\( S = 13 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Can I construct a sequence of 95 numbers with \\( S = 13 \\)?\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n- Let \\( k \\) be the number of +1s and \\( 95 - k \\) be the number of -1s.\n- Then \\( S = k - (95 - k) = 2k - 95 = 13 \\).\n- Solving for \\( k \\):\n  \\[\n  2k - 95 = 13 \\rightarrow 2k = 108 \\rightarrow k = 54\n  \\]\n- So, 54 numbers are +1, and 41 are -1.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Great,** this is possible! \\( k = 54 \\) and \\( 95 - k = 41 \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Total sum \\( S = 54 - 41 = 13 \\). \u2705\n\n#### **7. Calculating the Desired Sum**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, use \\( S = 13 \\) in the formula.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 95} a_i a_j = \\frac{1}{2} (13^2 - 95) = \\frac{1}{2} (169 - 95) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 74 = 37\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **This makes sense!** The smallest possible positive value is 37.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- All steps align correctly. The approach is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question Again**\n\nWait a minute, I think I see where I went wrong...\n\nLooking at this again, my initial approach led me to conclude that the smallest possible positive value is 37. However, according to the feedback, this answer was incorrect. Let me double-check my reasoning here and see if I can spot where I went off track.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- I explored calculating the sum explicitly but found it impractical.\n- Then, I used the formula for expanding sums, which seemed promising.\n- I proceeded to minimize the sum through \\( S \\) and calculated \\( S^2 - 95 \\) for odd \\( S \\).\n- Finally, I concluded that \\( S = 13 \\) yielded the smallest positive value, resulting in \\( \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 95} a_i a_j = 37 \\).\n\nActually, looking at this again, I realize that I might have misinterpreted the condition for minimizing \\( S \\). Let's revisit the sample solution and see where my thought process needs adjustment.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Correct Approach**\n\n**Sample Solution Insight:**\n\nLet\u2019s think about this differently. According to the sample solution, let\u2019s denote \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) as the number of +1\u2019s and -1\u2019s among the \\( a_i \\), respectively. Thus, \\( m + n = 95 \\), and the sum of squares is:\n\n\\[\na_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\dots + a_{95}^2 = 95\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 95} a_i a_j\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n2S + 95 = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \\right)^2 = (m - n)^2\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nHmm, I didn\u2019t consider expressing \\( S \\) in terms of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) before. This seems like a more structured approach. Let\u2019s explore this further.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBy expressing \\( S \\) in terms of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), I can relate the sum of pairwise products to the difference between the number of +1\u2019s and -1\u2019s. This connection might help me find the minimum positive value more accurately.\n\n---\n\n### **Adjusting the Approach**\n\n**Step 1: Expressing \\( S \\) in Terms of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s denote \\( m \\) as the number of +1\u2019s and \\( n \\) as the number of -1\u2019s. Therefore:\n\n\\[\nm + n = 95\n\\]\n\nThe sum of all \\( a_i \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i = m - n\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSo, \\( S \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( (m - n)^2 \\). Let\u2019s see how this plays out.\n\n**Step 2: Expanding \\( (m - n)^2 \\)**\n\n\\[\n(m - n)^2 = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \\right)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 95} a_i a_j = 95 + 2S\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n(m - n)^2 = 95 + 2S\n\\]\n\nRearranging,\n\n\\[\n2S = (m - n)^2 - 95\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{(m - n)^2 - 95}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis equation directly relates \\( S \\) to \\( (m - n)^2 \\). To minimize \\( S \\), I need to find the smallest odd perfect square greater than 95 because \\( (m - n) \\) must be odd (since 95 is odd, and the difference between two sums is odd).\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, let me double-check my earlier calculations. I initially concluded that \\( S = 13 \\) yielded \\( S = 37 \\), but according to the sample solution, the correct value should be \\( S = 13 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Identifying the Mistake**\n\nActually, looking at this again, I realize that I miscalculated the smallest odd perfect square greater than 95. Let\u2019s correct that.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To minimize \\( S \\) while keeping it positive, I need \\( (m - n)^2 \\) to be the smallest odd perfect square greater than 95.\n- The smallest odd perfect square greater than 95 is 121.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(m - n)^2 = 121 \\implies 2S = 121 - 95 = 26 \\implies S = \\frac{26}{2} = 13\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOh! This means the smallest possible positive value of \\( S \\) is actually 13, not 37 as I initially concluded.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s verify if this value is achievable.\n\n---\n\n### **Verifying the Correct Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Solving for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\)**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n(m - n)^2 = 121 \\implies m - n = \\pm 11\n\\]\n\nAnd,\n\n\\[\nm + n = 95\n\\]\n\n**Case 1: \\( m - n = 11 \\)**\n\n\\[\nm - n = 11 \\\\\nm + n = 95 \\\\\n\\implies 2m = 106 \\implies m = 53 \\\\\n\\implies n = 95 - 53 = 42\n\\]\n\n**Case 2: \\( m - n = -11 \\)**\n\n\\[\nm - n = -11 \\\\\nm + n = 95 \\\\\n\\implies 2m = 84 \\implies m = 42 \\\\\n\\implies n = 95 - 42 = 53\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth cases yield valid solutions where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are non-negative integers that sum up to 95.\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis aligns with the sample solution, confirming that the smallest possible positive value of \\( S \\) is indeed 13.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>13 Solution:</ANSWER>\n\nThe smallest possible positive value of \n\n\\[\n\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 95} a_i a_j\n\\]\n\nis **13**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy revisiting the problem and adjusting my approach to incorporate \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) (the counts of +1\u2019s and -1\u2019s), I was able to correct my initial miscalculation and arrive at the correct answer. Reflecting on my earlier steps and recognizing the need to express \\( S \\) in terms of \\( (m - n)^2 \\) was crucial in identifying the smallest possible positive value.\n\nI hope this revised walkthrough provides a clearer understanding of how to approach such combinatorial problems, reflecting a natural problem-solving process that involves exploring different strategies, identifying and correcting mistakes, and validating the final solution.",
