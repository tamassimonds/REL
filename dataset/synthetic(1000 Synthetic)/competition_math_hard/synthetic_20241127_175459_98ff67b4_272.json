  "problem": "What is the value of $c$ if $x\\cdot(3x+1)<c$ if and only when $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by brainstorming and exploring different strategies just like we naturally would. I'll write down my thoughts as they come, including any uncertainties or realizations along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, okay. The question asks us to find the value of \\( c \\) such that \\( x \\cdot (3x + 1) < c \\) holds **only** when \\( x \\) is within the interval \\( \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}, 2\\right) \\).\n\nAt first glance, this looks like an inequality problem involving a quadratic expression. I remember dealing with similar problems before, where we had to find the maximum or minimum values of a quadratic to determine such constants. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the right approach here. Let's brainstorm a bit.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Graphical Approach:**\n   - Maybe I can think about the graph of the quadratic function \\( y = x(3x + 1) = 3x^2 + x \\).\n   - Visualizing where this parabola lies below a horizontal line \\( y = c \\) might help.\n   - But I'm not great at graphing in my head, so perhaps plotting it might take too long.\n\n2. **Analytical Approach:**\n   - Another idea is to set up the inequality \\( 3x^2 + x < c \\) and see how it behaves over the given interval.\n   - This might involve finding the roots of the equation where equality holds, i.e., \\( 3x^2 + x = c \\).\n\n3. **Using Vertex of the Parabola:**\n   - Maybe finding the vertex of the parabola could give insights since the vertex represents the minimum or maximum point.\n   - But wait, the interval is finite, so perhaps the extrema within the interval are more relevant.\n\n4. **Testing Endpoint Values:**\n   - Evaluating the quadratic at the endpoints of the interval might help determine \\( c \\).\n   - If \\( c \\) is the maximum value of the quadratic within the interval, this could be the key.\n\nHmm, I think I'll start with the **analytical approach** by setting up the inequality and see where that leads. If it doesn't work, I can always pivot to another strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Inequality**\n\nLet's start by writing the inequality:\n\n\\[\nx(3x + 1) < c \\quad \\text{for } x \\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}, 2\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, the quadratic expression \\( 3x^2 + x \\) must be less than \\( c \\) within this interval.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThis inequality needs to hold strictly within the given range. Therefore, \\( c \\) should be at least equal to the maximum value of \\( 3x^2 + x \\) within this interval. Hmm, that makes sense because the inequality must hold up to the boundary points but not beyond them.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Maximum Value Within the Interval**\n\nTo find \\( c \\), I need to determine the maximum value of \\( 3x^2 + x \\) over \\( \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}, 2\\right) \\).\n\n**Approach:**  \n- I can either take the derivative of the quadratic to find critical points or evaluate the expression at the endpoints since it's a simple parabola.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGiven that this is a parabola opening upwards (because the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive), the maximum value within the interval should occur at one of the endpoints. So, perhaps checking the endpoints is a quicker way.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluating the Quadratic at the Endpoints**\n\nLet's calculate \\( 3x^2 + x \\) at both endpoints:\n\n1. **At \\( x = -\\frac{7}{3} \\):**\n\n\\[\n3\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right) = 3 \\times \\frac{49}{9} - \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{147}{9} - \\frac{21}{9} = \\frac{126}{9} = 14\n\\]\n\n2. **At \\( x = 2 \\):**\n\n\\[\n3(2)^2 + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14\n\\]\n\n**Observations:**  \nBoth endpoints yield a value of 14. Hmm, interesting! This suggests that \\( c = 14 \\) might be the value we're looking for since the quadratic reaches 14 at both endpoints.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Inequality**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's verify whether \\( c = 14 \\) satisfies the condition \\( x(3x + 1) < 14 \\) **only** within \\( \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}, 2\\right) \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- If \\( c = 14 \\), then at \\( x = -\\frac{7}{3} \\) and \\( x = 2 \\), the inequality becomes an equality: \\( x(3x + 1) = 14 \\).\n- Therefore, the inequality \\( x(3x + 1) < 14 \\) holds strictly within the open interval \\( \\left(-\\frac{7}{3}, 2\\right) \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis satisfies the condition given in the problem. So, \\( c = 14 \\) is indeed the correct value.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Double-Checking the Approach**\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to ensure that this approach is solid.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Does the inequality hold outside the interval?**  \n  - For \\( x < -\\frac{7}{3} \\) or \\( x > 2 \\), let's see if \\( x(3x + 1) \\) exceeds 14.\n  - Since the parabola opens upwards, the values of \\( 3x^2 + x \\) will be greater than 14 outside this interval.\n\n- **Is there any point within the interval where \\( x(3x + 1) = 14 \\)?**  \n  - Yes, exactly at the endpoints \\( x = -\\frac{7}{3} \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n**Final Check:**  \nEverything aligns with the condition provided: the inequality holds strictly within the open interval, and equality occurs exactly at the boundaries. This reassures me that \\( c = 14 \\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach**\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another method to see if we arrive at the same conclusion.\n\n**Strategy:**  \n- **Finding Critical Points:**  \n  - Take the derivative of \\( 3x^2 + x \\) to find where the slope is zero (i.e., critical points).\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Derivative:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx}(3x^2 + x) = 6x + 1\n\\]\n\n2. **Set Derivative to Zero:**\n\n\\[\n6x + 1 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -\\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:**  \n- There's a critical point at \\( x = -\\frac{1}{6} \\).\n- Since the parabola opens upwards, this is a minimum point.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The maximum value within the interval occurs at the endpoints, as we found earlier.\n- Therefore, \\( c = 14 \\) remains valid.\n\nThis alternative approach confirms our initial finding.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Wrapping Up**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, starting with analyzing the endpoints, and verifying through derivative analysis, we've consistently arrived at \\( c = 14 \\). Throughout the process, checking each step ensured the correctness of the solution, making sure that the inequality holds strictly within the specified interval.\n\nIf there were any discrepancies or doubts during the initial steps, considering alternative methods like derivative analysis helped reinforce the validity of the solution. This thorough approach ensures that the final answer is both accurate and robust.",
  "ground_truth": "When $x\\in \\left(-\\frac{7}{3},2\\right)$, we have $x\\cdot(3x+1)-c<0$. This means that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ at $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$. We now know that $x(3x+1)-c=0$ is a quadratic equation with roots at $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ and $x=2$, and we want to use these roots to find a quadratic of the same form as the problem.  $x=-\\frac{7}{3}$ gives us $(3x+7)=0$ and $x=2$ gives us $(x-2)=0$. \\begin{align*}\nx(3x+1)-c&=(3x+7)(x-2)\\\\\n&=3x^2+x-14\\\\\n&=x(3x+1)-14.\n\\end{align*} So, $c=\\boxed{14}$."
