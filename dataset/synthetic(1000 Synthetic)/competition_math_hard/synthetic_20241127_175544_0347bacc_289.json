  "solution": "**Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it just like I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work frequently, and being open to changing directions if needed.**\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we have a polynomial:\n\n\\[\nP(x) = 2x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c\n\\]\n\nwith the following properties:\n\n1. **The mean of its zeros, the product of its zeros, and the sum of the coefficients are all equal.**\n2. **The \\( y \\)-intercept is 8.**\n3. **We need to find the coefficient \\( b \\).**\n\nAt first glance, this looks like a problem involving the relationships between the coefficients and zeros of a polynomial. I recall that **Vieta's formulas** might be helpful here since they relate the zeros to the coefficients. But I'm not entirely sure yet\u2014let's brainstorm some strategies.\n\n---\n\n## **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use Vieta's Formulas:**\n   - Vieta's relates the sums and products of the zeros to the coefficients. This seems directly relevant since the mean and product of the zeros are involved.\n\n2. **Express the Conditions Mathematically:**\n   - Translate the given conditions into equations. This might help set up a system of equations to solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n3. **Consider the Sum of Coefficients:**\n   - The sum of the coefficients is given to be equal to the mean of the zeros and the product of the zeros. This could provide a direct equation.\n\n4. **Utilize the \\( y \\)-Intercept:**\n   - The \\( y \\)-intercept is where \\( x = 0 \\), so \\( P(0) = c = 8 \\). This immediately gives us the value of \\( c \\).\n\nI think starting with Vieta's formulas and incorporating the given conditions is a good way to proceed. Let's begin with that.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Applying Vieta's Formulas**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Vieta's formulas for a cubic polynomial \\( P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\) with roots \\( r_1, r_2, r_3 \\) are:\n  - The sum of the roots:  \n  \\[\n  r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\\frac{b}{a}\n  \\]\n  - The product of the roots:  \n  \\[\n  r_1 r_2 r_3 = -\\frac{d}{a}\n  \\]\n  - The mean of the roots:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{mean} = \\frac{r_1 + r_2 + r_3}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Applying to Our Polynomial:**\n- Our polynomial is \n\\[\nP(x) = 2x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c\n\\]\nso:\n  - Leading coefficient \\( a = 2 \\).\n  - Therefore:\n    - Sum of zeros:  \n    \\[\n    r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\\frac{a}{2}\n    \\]\n    - Product of zeros:  \n    \\[\n    r_1 r_2 r_3 = -\\frac{c}{2}\n    \\]  \n    (since there's no constant term multiplied by \\( x^0 \\) other than \\( c \\))\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait a minute, I initially labeled the coefficients incorrectly. Let's fix that:\n  - Our polynomial is \n  \\[\n  P(x) = 2x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c\n  \\]\n  - Here, the leading coefficient \\( a_3 = 2 \\), and the other coefficients are \\( a_2 = a \\), \\( a_1 = b \\), and \\( a_0 = c \\).\n\n**Correcting Vieta's Application:**\n- Sum of zeros:  \n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\\frac{a}{2}\n\\]\n- Product of zeros:  \n\\[\nr_1 r_2 r_3 = -\\frac{c}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this make sense? Yes, because Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients to the sums and products of the roots.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Translating the Given Conditions into Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- We know that the mean of the zeros, the product of the zeros, and the sum of the coefficients are all equal. Let's write this down mathematically.\n\n**Mean of the Zeros:**\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{r_1 + r_2 + r_3}{3} = \\frac{-\\frac{a}{2}}{3} = -\\frac{a}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Product of the Zeros:**\n\\[\nr_1 r_2 r_3 = -\\frac{c}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Sum of the Coefficients:**\n\\[\n2 + a + b + c\n\\]\n\n**Given Condition:**\n\\[\n\\text{Mean of zeros} = \\text{Product of zeros} = \\text{Sum of coefficients}\n\\]\n\n**Setting Up Equations:**\n\\[\n-\\frac{a}{6} = -\\frac{c}{2} = 2 + a + b + c\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This looks like it might lead to a system of equations. But handling three variables simultaneously can be tricky. Maybe I should break it down or look for additional information to simplify.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Utilizing the \\( y \\)-Intercept**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- We know that the \\( y \\)-intercept of the polynomial is 8, which means \\( P(0) = c = 8 \\).\n\n**Applying This Information:**\n\\[\nc = 8\n\\]\n\n**Updating Our Equations:**\n\\[\n-\\frac{a}{6} = -\\frac{8}{2} = -4\n\\]\n\\[\n-\\frac{a}{6} = -4 \\implies a = 24\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this make sense? Let's see:\n  - If \\(-\\frac{a}{6} = -4\\), then \\(a = 24\\). That seems correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So far, so good. We've found \\(c = 8\\) and \\(a = 24\\). Now we only need to find \\(b\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Finding \\( b \\) Using the Sum of Coefficients**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- We have one more equation from the given condition:\n\\[\n2 + a + b + c = -\\frac{a}{6}\n\\]\n- We already know \n\\[\na = 24\n\\]\nand \n\\[\nc = 8\n\\]\n. Let's plug these values in and solve for \\( b \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n2 + 24 + b + 8 = -\\frac{24}{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n34 + b = -4\n\\]\n\\[\nb = -4 - 34 = -38\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this result make sense? Let's verify by substituting back into the original conditions.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- It's always a good idea to check if the obtained values satisfy all the given conditions. Let's do that.\n\n**Mean of the Zeros:**\n\\[\n-\\frac{a}{6} = -\\frac{24}{6} = -4\n\\]\n\n**Product of the Zeros:**\n\\[\n-\\frac{c}{2} = -\\frac{8}{2} = -4\n\\]\n\n**Sum of the Coefficients:**\n\\[\n2 + 24 + (-38) + 8 = 34 - 38 = -4\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n- All three quantities are equal to \\(-4\\), which satisfies the given condition that the mean of the zeros, the product of the zeros, and the sum of the coefficients are all equal.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Everything checks out. The solution seems correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically applying Vieta's formulas, translating the given conditions into mathematical equations, and utilizing the information about the \\( y \\)-intercept, we were able to find the coefficients of the polynomial step by step. Regular checks and validations ensured the correctness of the solution throughout the process.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER> b = -38 </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The $y$-intercept of the graph is the point at which $x=0$. At that point, $P(x)=c$, which we are told is equal to 8. Thus, $c=8$. The product of the roots of the given polynomial is $-\\frac{c}{2}=-4$. The problem states that the mean of the zeros must also equal $-4$, so the sum of the three zeros (this is a cubic equation) is equal to $3 \\cdot -4 = -12$. The sum of the zeros is also equal to $-\\frac{a}{2}$, so $a=24$. Finally, we are given that the sum of the coefficients, or $2+ a+b+c$, is also equal to $-4$. Plugging in our known values of $a$ and $c$, we have $2+24+b+8=-4$. Solving for $b$, we get $b=\\boxed{-38}$."
