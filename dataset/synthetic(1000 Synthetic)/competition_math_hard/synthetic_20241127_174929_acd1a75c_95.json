  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it naturally. I'll walk through my thought process, explore different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:**  \n  Hmm, we have a hyperbola with given asymptotes and a point it passes through. The goal is to find the constants in its standard equation and compute \\(a + h\\).\n\n- **Brainstorming:**  \n  I remember that asymptotes provide information about the slopes and the center of a hyperbola. This suggests that identifying the center \\((h, k)\\) is crucial. Once I have that, I can use the given point to find the other constants.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**  \n  1. **Use Asymptotes to Find the Center:** Since the asymptotes intersect at the center of the hyperbola, I can find \\((h, k)\\) by solving their equations.  \n  2. **Determine \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):** Use the slopes of the asymptotes to relate \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).  \n  3. **Plug the Given Point into the Hyperbola Equation:** Use the point \\((0, 7)\\) to solve for the remaining constants.\n\n- **Checking for Understanding:**  \n  Does this make sense? Yes, because the asymptotes define the orientation and shape of the hyperbola, so starting there seems logical.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Center \\((h, k)\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  The asymptotes intersect at the center of the hyperbola. Given the equations \\(y = 2x + 5\\) and \\(y = -2x + 1\\), I can find their intersection point by solving the system of equations.\n\n- **Solving the System:**  \n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  2x + 5 &= -2x + 1 \\\\\n  4x &= -4 \\\\\n  x &= -1\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n\n- **Find \\(y\\):**  \n  \\[\n  y = 2(-1) + 5 = 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Result:**  \n  So, the center is \\((h, k) = (-1, 3)\\).\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Does this make sense? Yes, because the asymptotes should intersect at the center.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) Using the Slopes**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  The slopes of the asymptotes are \u00b12. I recall that for hyperbolas, the slopes are \\(\\pm \\frac{a}{b}\\) or \\(\\pm \\frac{b}{a}\\), depending on the orientation. Since the slopes are integers, it suggests that \\(\\frac{a}{b} = 2\\) or \\(\\frac{b}{a} = 2\\).\n\n- **Exploring Options:**  \n  - **Option 1:** \\(\\frac{a}{b} = 2\\) \u21d2 \\(a = 2b\\)  \n  - **Option 2:** \\(\\frac{b}{a} = 2\\) \u21d2 \\(b = 2a\\)  \n  \n- **Checking Orientation:**  \n  Since the asymptotes have both positive and negative slopes, it aligns with \\(\\frac{a}{b} = 2\\).\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Let\u2019s go with \\(a = 2b\\).\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Does \\(\\frac{a}{b} = 2\\) match the given slopes? Yes, because \\(\\frac{2b}{b} = 2\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Plugging the Given Point \\((0, 7)\\) into the Hyperbola Equation**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Now that I have the center and a relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I can use the standard form of the hyperbola equation to find the constants. The equation is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1\n  \\]\n  Substituting \\((h, k) = (-1, 3)\\) and the point \\((0, 7)\\).\n\n- **Substitution:**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{(7 - 3)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(0 + 1)^2}{b^2} = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16}{a^2} - \\frac{1}{b^2} = 1\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This gives me one equation, but I need another to solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Do I have enough information? Yes, because I can use the relationship \\(a = 2b\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  I have \\(a = 2b\\). Let\u2019s substitute this into the equation to solve for \\(b\\), and then find \\(a\\).\n\n- **Substitution:**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{16}{(2b)^2} - \\frac{1}{b^2} = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16}{4b^2} - \\frac{1}{b^2} = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4}{b^2} - \\frac{1}{b^2} = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{b^2} = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  b^2 = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = \\sqrt{3}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Finding \\(a\\):**  \n  \\[\n  a = 2b = 2\\sqrt{3}\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Does this satisfy the original equation?\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16}{(2\\sqrt{3})^2} - \\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\frac{16}{12} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = 1\n  \\]\n  Yes, it checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating \\(a + h\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Now that I have \\(a = 2\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(h = -1\\), I can easily compute \\(a + h\\).\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  a + h = 2\\sqrt{3} + (-1) = 2\\sqrt{3} - 1\n  \\]\n\n- **Final Check:**  \n  Does this result make sense? Yes, all calculations align with the given data.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\\[\na + h = 2\\sqrt{3} - 1\n\\]\n  \n<summary>solution</summary>\n  \nBy systematically identifying the center of the hyperbola through the intersection of its asymptotes, relating the slopes to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and leveraging the given point, we determined that \\(a + h = 2\\sqrt{3} - 1\\).\n  \n<details>\n<summary>Complete Thought Process</summary>\n  \n**First Thoughts:**  \n- Initial Reaction: Given asymptotes and a point, need to find constants in the hyperbola's equation.  \n- Brainstorming: Asymptotes hint at the center; use them to find \\((h, k)\\), then use the point to find \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).  \n- Checking Understanding: Asymptotes intersect at the center\u2014logical starting point.\n  \n**Step 1: Finding the Center \\((h, k)\\)**  \n- Solving \\(y = 2x + 5\\) and \\(y = -2x + 1\\):  \n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  2x + 5 &= -2x + 1 \\\\\n  4x &= -4 \\\\\n  x &= -1\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]  \n  Substituting \\(x = -1\\) into \\(y = 2x + 5\\):  \n  \\[\n  y = 2(-1) + 5 = 3\n  \\]  \n- Result: Center is \\((-1, 3)\\).\n  \n**Step 2: Determining \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) Using the Slopes**  \n- Asymptotes' slopes: \u00b12 \u21d2 \\(\\frac{a}{b} = 2\\) \u21d2 \\(a = 2b\\).\n  \n**Step 3: Plugging the Given Point \\((0, 7)\\) into the Hyperbola Equation**  \n- Substituting into \\(\\frac{(y - 3)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x + 1)^2}{b^2} = 1\\):  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{16}{a^2} - \\frac{1}{b^2} = 1\n  \\]\n  \n**Step 4: Solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**  \n- Substituting \\(a = 2b\\):  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{16}{4b^2} - \\frac{1}{b^2} = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{3}{b^2} = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b^2 = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = \\sqrt{3}\n  \\]  \n- Finding \\(a\\):  \n  \\[\n  a = 2b = 2\\sqrt{3}\n  \\]\n  \n**Step 5: Calculating \\(a + h\\)**  \n- \\(a + h = 2\\sqrt{3} - 1\\)\n  \n**Final Check:**  \nAll calculations align with the given data, confirming that \\(a + h = 2\\sqrt{3} - 1\\).\n  \n</details>\n  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Does the Solution Make Sense?**  \n  Absolutely.

  "ground_truth": "Solving the system $y=2x+5$ and $y=-2x+1,$ we get $(x, y) = (-1, 3).$ Therefore, the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at $(-1, 3),$ which must be the center of the hyperbola.
