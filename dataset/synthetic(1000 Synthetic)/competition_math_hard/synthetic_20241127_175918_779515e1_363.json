  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thinking process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, including brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, and checking my work along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, so Kevin Kangaroo starts at 0 on a number line and wants to reach 1. He can only hop **\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)** of the remaining distance with each hop. After five hops, I need to determine how far he's traveled. The answer should be a common fraction.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\nThis reminds me of those problems involving geometric sequences where the distance covered decreases with each step. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the best approach yet. I'll brainstorm a few strategies to see which one fits.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Geometric Series Approach:**\n   - Since Kevin hops a fraction of the remaining distance each time, this might form a geometric series. I could sum the distances of the first five hops.\n\n2. **Iterative Calculation:**\n   - Calculate the exact distance after each hop up to the fifth one by repeatedly taking **\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)** of the remaining distance.\n\n3. **Visualization:**\n   - Maybe draw a number line to visually see how much is covered after each hop to get an intuitive sense of the problem.\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n\nUsing a geometric series seems efficient, but calculating each hop individually might help ensure accuracy. Visualization could also help, but it might be time-consuming. I think starting with the **Iterative Calculation** approach makes sense to ensure I capture each step accurately.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Iterative Calculation**\n\n**Approach:**\n\nI'll calculate the position after each hop by determining **\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)** of the remaining distance to 1.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand\u2014after each hop, the remaining distance decreases, so each subsequent hop covers less ground. Yup, that makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: First Hop**\n\n- **Starting Point:** 0\n- **Remaining Distance to 1:** 1\n- **Hop Distance:** **\\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}\\)**\n- **New Position:** \n\n\\[ \n0 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, moving **\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)** of the total distance from 0 lands me at **\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)**.\n\n**Quick Reflection:**\n\nSo far, so good. The first hop is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Second Hop**\n\n- **Starting Point:** **\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)**\n- **Remaining Distance to 1:** \n\n\\[ \n1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \n\\]\n\n- **Hop Distance:** \n\n\\[ \n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{9} \n\\]\n\n- **New Position:** \n\n\\[ \n\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9} \n\\]\n\n- **Calculating Sum:** \n\n\\[ \n\\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nAdding **\\(\\frac{2}{9}\\)** to **\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)** (which is **\\(\\frac{3}{9}\\)**) gives **\\(\\frac{5}{9}\\)**. That seems correct.\n\n**Quick Reflection:**\n\nThe second hop reduces the remaining distance as expected. Let's continue.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Third Hop**\n\n- **Starting Point:** **\\(\\frac{5}{9}\\)**\n- **Remaining Distance to 1:** \n\n\\[ \n1 - \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{4}{9} \n\\]\n\n- **Hop Distance:** \n\n\\[ \n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{4}{27} \n\\]\n\n- **New Position:** \n\n\\[ \n\\frac{5}{9} + \\frac{4}{27} \n\\]\n\n- **Calculating Sum:** \n  - Convert **\\(\\frac{5}{9}\\)** to **\\(\\frac{15}{27}\\)**:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{15}{27} + \\frac{4}{27} = \\frac{19}{27} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nConverting to a common denominator works out, so **\\(\\frac{19}{27}\\)** is correct.\n\n**Quick Reflection:**\n\nThree hops in, and the pattern seems consistent. The distances are decreasing appropriately.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Fourth Hop**\n\n- **Starting Point:** **\\(\\frac{19}{27}\\)**\n- **Remaining Distance to 1:** \n\n\\[ \n1 - \\frac{19}{27} = \\frac{8}{27} \n\\]\n\n- **Hop Distance:** \n\n\\[ \n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{8}{81} \n\\]\n\n- **New Position:** \n\n\\[ \n\\frac{19}{27} + \\frac{8}{81} \n\\]\n\n- **Calculating Sum:** \n  - Convert **\\(\\frac{19}{27}\\)** to **\\(\\frac{57}{81}\\)**:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{57}{81} + \\frac{8}{81} = \\frac{65}{81} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nAdding **\\(\\frac{8}{81}\\)** to **\\(\\frac{57}{81}\\)** gives **\\(\\frac{65}{81}\\)**. That looks right.\n\n**Quick Reflection:**\n\nThe calculations are holding up. One more hop to go.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Fifth Hop**\n\n- **Starting Point:** **\\(\\frac{65}{81}\\)**\n- **Remaining Distance to 1:** \n\n\\[ \n1 - \\frac{65}{81} = \\frac{16}{81} \n\\]\n\n- **Hop Distance:** \n\n\\[ \n\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{16}{81} = \\frac{16}{243} \n\\]\n\n- **New Position:** \n\n\\[ \n\\frac{65}{81} + \\frac{16}{243} \n\\]\n\n- **Calculating Sum:** \n  - Convert **\\(\\frac{65}{81}\\)** to **\\(\\frac{195}{243}\\)**:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{195}{243} + \\frac{16}{243} = \\frac{211}{243} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nAdding **\\(\\frac{16}{243}\\)** to **\\(\\frac{195}{243}\\)** gives **\\(\\frac{211}{243}\\)**. This seems correct.\n\n**Quick Reflection:**\n\nAll five hops calculated consistently. The final position seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n\nLooking at **\\(\\frac{211}{243}\\)**:\n\n- This fraction is slightly less than 1, which makes sense because Kevin is hopping fractions of the remaining distance.\n- After five hops, he'd still be short of reaching 1, aligning with the problem's setup.\n\n**Alternative Strategy Confirmation:**\n\nThinking back to the **Geometric Series Approach**, the sum of the first five terms would lead to the same result. But calculating each hop individually ensured accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>\\(\\frac{211}{243}\\)</ANSWER>\n\nAfter five hops, Kevin Kangaroo has traveled **\\(\\frac{211}{243}\\)** on the number line.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy breaking down each hop and calculating the distance covered step by step, I ensured that the approach was correct. Regular checks after each step helped catch any potential errors early on. Brainstorming different strategies initially and choosing the iterative method provided clarity and accuracy in solving the problem.\n\n---\n\nNow, let's put this together into a coherent and complete solution:\n\n---\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nKevin Kangaroo starts at 0 on a number line and wants to reach 1.

  "ground_truth": "Kevin hops $1/3$ of the remaining distance with every hop. His first hop takes $1/3$ closer. For his second hop, he has $2/3$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)(1/3)$. For his third hop, he has $(2/3)^2$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)^2(1/3)$. In general, Kevin hops forward $(2/3)^{k-1}(1/3)$ on his $k$th hop. We want to find how far he has hopped after five hops. This is a finite geometric series with first term $1/3$, common ratio $2/3$, and five terms. Thus, Kevin has hopped $\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5\\right)}{1-\\frac{2}{3}} = \\boxed{\\frac{211}{243}}$."
