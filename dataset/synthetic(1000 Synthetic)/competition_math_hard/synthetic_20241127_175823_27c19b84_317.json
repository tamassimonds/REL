  "problem": "Henry's Hamburger Heaven offers its hamburgers with the following condiments: ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, tomato, lettuce, pickles, cheese, and onions. A customer can choose one, two, or three meat patties, and any collection of condiments. How many different kinds of hamburgers can be ordered?",
  "solution": "Certainly! Let's approach the problem step by step, reflecting on different strategies, verifying calculations, and making necessary adjustments to ensure accuracy. Here's how a human might naturally work through it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Impressions and Brainstorming**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Okay, so Henry's Hamburger Heaven offers hamburgers with **eight condiments** and the option to choose **one, two, or three meat patties**.\n- **Initial Reaction:** This sounds like a combinations problem, but I'm unsure whether to treat patties and condiments separately or together.\n- **Uncertainty:** I need to think about how to mix and match condiments with different patty options.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **List Out All Possibilities:**\n   - Maybe I could list different combinations manually to get an idea.\n   - **Reflection:** With eight condiments, that could get overwhelming\u2014probably too many to handle manually.\n\n2. **Use Combinatorics for Condiments:**\n   - Calculate all possible combinations of condiments using \\(2^n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of condiments.\n   - **Thought:** This seems familiar, like calculating the power set of condiments.\n\n3. **Consider Patties Separately:**\n   - Treat patty choices as independent from condiments.\n   - **Idea:** Multiply the number of patty options by the number of condiment combinations.\n\n4. **Combine Patties and Condiments Differently:**\n   - Think of each patty-condiment combination as unique.\n   - **Doubt:** Is this overcomplicating it?\n\n**Choosing a Starting Point:**  \n- Given the complexity, starting with combinatorics for condiments and then incorporating patty choices seems logical. Let's try that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Condiment Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- There are **eight condiments**: ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, tomato, lettuce, pickles, cheese, and onions.\n- A customer can choose **any collection** of these condiments, including no condiments at all.\n- **Reflection:** This sounds like calculating the power set, where each condiment can either be included or not.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n2^8 = 256\n\\]\n\n- **Quick Check:** Each condiment has two options: included or not. With eight condiments, that's \\(2^8 = 256\\).\n- **Verification:** This includes the option of having no condiments, which is a valid choice per the problem statement.\n\n**But Wait...**\n\n- **Realization:** Initially considered subtracting the no-condiment option, but since \"any collection\" includes having no condiments, \\(256\\) is correct.\n\n**<ANSWER> solution 1</ANSWER>**\n\n- Total condiment combinations: **256**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Incorporating Patty Choices**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Customers can choose **one, two, or three meat patties**, giving us three distinct options.\n- **Reflection:** These patty choices are independent of the condiment combinations.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n256 \\text{ (condiment combinations)} \\times 3 \\text{ (patty options)} = 768\n\\]\n\n- **Quick Check:** Multiplying the number of condiment combinations by the patty options makes sense because each condiment combination can pair with any patty choice.\n- **Verification:** Does this capture all possibilities? Yes, each patty option can be combined with any set of condiments.\n\n**<ANSWER> solution 2</ANSWER>**\n\n- Total different kinds of hamburgers: **768**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Wait a minute:** Is there another way to verify this? Maybe use a different method to ensure the answer is correct.\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Consider whether each number of patties has its own set of condiment combinations.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\n- **Suppose** each patty option corresponds to its own set of condiment combinations. However, since condiment choices are independent of the number of patties, the initial multiplication still holds.\n- **Verification:** The multiplication of condiment combinations by patty options accurately represents all possible hamburger variations.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Align with Initial Calculation?**  \n  - Yes, both strategies lead to the same total: \\(256\\) condiment combinations \\(\\times 3\\) patty options = **768** total combinations.\n- **Conclusion:** The original approach is correct.\n\n**<ANSWER> solution 3</ANSWER>**\n\n- Total different kinds of hamburgers: **768**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Does the Answer Make Sense?**  \n  - Given the number of condiments and patty options, **768** different combinations seem reasonable.\n- **Is There Anything I Missed?**  \n  - Initially considered subtracting the no-condiment option but realized it's a valid choice.\n- **Alternative Verification:**  \n  - Used a different perspective (binary choices for condiments and independent patty selection) to confirm the total.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n\\[\n256 \\times 3 = 768\n\\]\n\n- **Recalculate if Needed:**  \n  - No discrepancies found; the calculations are consistent.\n\n**<ANSWER> final solution</ANSWER>**\n\n- **Total different kinds of hamburgers:** **768**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring various strategies, checking, and verifying the calculations, we confidently conclude that there are **768** different kinds of hamburgers that can be ordered at Henry's Hamburger Heaven. By carefully considering both condiment and patty options and ensuring that all combinations are accounted for, the final answer stands robust.\n\n---\n\nThis approach reflects a natural problem-solving process, incorporating brainstorming, reflection, verification, and adjustment to arrive at the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "A customer makes one of two choices for each condiment, to include it or not to include it. The choices are made independently, so there are $2^8 = 256$ possible combinations of condiments. For each of those combinations there are three choices regarding the number of meat patties, so there are altogether $(3)(256)=\\boxed{768}$ different kinds of hamburgers."
