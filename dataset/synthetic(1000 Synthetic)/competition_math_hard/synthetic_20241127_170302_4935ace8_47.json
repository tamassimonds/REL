  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I'd tackle it if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question asks for the intersection of two lines given by the equations:\n\n\\[ \n2y = -x + 3 \n\\]\n\\[ \n-y = 5x + 1 \n\\]\n\n**Initial Reflection:**  \nHmm, this reminds me of finding where two lines cross, which means I need the point \\((x, y)\\) that satisfies both equations simultaneously. I think I\u2019ve done something similar before using substitution or elimination methods. But wait, what if there's a better way? Let me brainstorm different strategies first.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Substitution Method:**  \n   Solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other.\n\n2. **Elimination Method:**  \n   Add or subtract equations to eliminate one variable.\n\n3. **Graphical Approach:**  \n   Sketch the lines to visually find the intersection.\n\n4. **Matrix Method:**  \n   Use linear algebra to solve the system.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe graphical approach is intuitive but might not give an exact answer unless I plot it precisely. The matrix method seems overkill for two simple equations. So, I\u2019m leaning towards either substitution or elimination. Let me explore substitution first since it might be straightforward here.\n\n### **Trying the Substitution Method**\n\n#### **Step 1: Solve One Equation for a Variable**\n\nLooking at the first equation:  \n\\[ \n2y = -x + 3 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI can easily solve this for \\(y\\) by dividing both sides by 2.\n\n\\[ \ny = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{2} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nYeah, that looks correct. Now I have \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\).\n\n#### **Step 2: Substitute into the Second Equation**\n\nNow, substitute \\(y\\) from the first equation into the second equation:  \n\\[ \n-y = 5x + 1 \n\\]\n\nReplacing \\(y\\):  \n\\[ \n-\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) = 5x + 1 \n\\]\n\n**Simplify:**  \n\\[ \n\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2} = 5x + 1 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute, this looks a bit messy. Let me make sure I did the substitution correctly.\n\n**Check:**  \nYeah, substituting \\(-y\\) should flip the signs, so it seems fine.\n\n#### **Step 3: Solve for \\(x\\)**\n\nLet's get all the \\(x\\) terms on one side:  \n\\[ \n\\frac{1}{2}x - 5x = 1 + \\frac{3}{2} \n\\]\n\n**Simplify:**  \n\\[ \n\\frac{1}{2}x - 5x = \\frac{5}{2} \n\\]\n\n**Combine Like Terms:**  \n\\[ \n-\\frac{9}{2}x = \\frac{5}{2} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, dividing both sides by \\(-\\frac{9}{2}\\) should give me \\(x\\).\n\n**Solve for \\(x\\):**  \n\\[ \nx = \\frac{5}{2} \\times -\\frac{2}{9} = -\\frac{5}{9} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me quickly plug this back to see if it makes sense. But wait, instead of checking now, maybe I should find \\(y\\) first and then verify both.\n\n### **Finding \\(y\\) Using the Value of \\(x\\)**\n\n#### **Step 4: Substitute \\(x\\) Back into the First Equation**\n\nUsing \\(x = -\\frac{5}{9}\\) in  \n\\[ \ny = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{2} \n\\]\n\n**Calculate:**  \n\\[ \ny = -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\frac{5}{9}\\right) + \\frac{3}{2} \n\\]  \n\\[ \ny = \\frac{5}{18} + \\frac{27}{18} = \\frac{32}{18} = \\frac{16}{9} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat seems correct. But let me ensure the arithmetic is right.\n\n**Check:**  \n\\[ \n\\frac{5}{18} + \\frac{27}{18} = \\frac{32}{18} = \\frac{16}{9} \n\\]  \nYep, that adds up.\n\n### **Verification of the Solution**\n\n#### **Step 5: Plugging Back into the Second Equation**\n\nNow, let's verify by plugging \\(x = -\\frac{5}{9}\\) and \\(y = \\frac{16}{9}\\) into the second equation:  \n\\[ \n-y = 5x + 1 \n\\]\n\n**Left Side Calculation:**  \n\\[ \n-\\frac{16}{9} \n\\]\n\n**Right Side Calculation:**  \n\\[ \n5\\left(-\\frac{5}{9}\\right) + 1 = -\\frac{25}{9} + \\frac{9}{9} = -\\frac{16}{9} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth sides are equal, so the solution satisfies the second equation as well.\n\n**Check:**  \nThis confirms that our solution is correct.\n\n### **Alternative Method: Elimination**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nJust to be sure, let me quickly try the elimination method to see if I arrive at the same answer.\n\n#### **Step 1: Align the Equations**\n\nFirst Equation:  \n\\[ \n2y = -x + 3 \n\\]\n\nSecond Equation:  \n\\[ \n-y = 5x + 1 \n\\]\n\n#### **Step 2: Multiply the Second Equation to Align Terms**\n\nMultiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of \\(y\\) the same:  \n\\[ \n-2y = 10x + 2 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow, I can add both equations to eliminate \\(y\\).\n\n#### **Step 3: Add Both Equations**\n\n\\[ \n2y + (-2y) = -x + 3 + 10x + 2 \n\\]  \n\\[ \n0 = 9x + 5 \n\\]\n\n**Solve for \\(x\\):**  \n\\[ \n9x = -5 \n\\]  \n\\[ \nx = -\\frac{5}{9} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSame \\(x\\) value as before. That\u2019s reassuring.\n\n#### **Step 4: Find \\(y\\)**\n\nUsing \\(x = -\\frac{5}{9}\\) in the first equation:  \n\\[ \n2y = -\\left(-\\frac{5}{9}\\right) + 3 = \\frac{5}{9} + 3 = \\frac{5}{9} + \\frac{27}{9} = \\frac{32}{9} \n\\]  \n\\[ \ny = \\frac{32}{9} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{16}{9} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nSame \\(y\\) value as before. The elimination method confirms the substitution method\u2019s result.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBoth methods\u2014substitution and elimination\u2014led to the same solution. The verification step ensured that the solution satisfies both equations.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI\u2019m confident that the intersection point is correct. Trying multiple strategies helped confirm the accuracy.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\\((- \\frac{5}{9}, \\frac{16}{9})\\)  \nsolution</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, attempting substitution first, verifying with elimination, and consistently checking each step, I've ensured that the intersection point \\((- \\frac{5}{9}, \\frac{16}{9})\\) is accurate. This approach mimics a natural problem-solving process, embracing reflections, checks, and validations along the way.",
  "ground_truth": "To find the intersection, we must find the point satisfying both equations. Hence we must solve the system \\begin{align*}\n2y&=-x+3, \\\\\n-y&=5x+1.\n\\end{align*}Adding two times the second equation to the first, we get $2y+2(-y)=-x+3+2(5x+1)$, which simplifies to $0=9x+5$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=-\\frac{5}{9}$. Plugging this into the second equation above, we obtain $-y=5\\cdot -\\frac{5}{9}+1=-\\frac{16}{9}$. So the intersection is $\\boxed{\\left(-\\frac{5}{9}, \\frac{16}{9}\\right)}$."
