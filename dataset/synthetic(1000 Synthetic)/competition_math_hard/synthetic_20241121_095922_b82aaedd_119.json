  "solution": "### **Complete Solution: Determining the Number of Primes in the Range \\( n! + 1 \\) to \\( n! + n \\)**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step, reflecting on different strategies, testing ideas, and making sure our final answer is solid. \n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming and First Impressions**\n\nWhen I first see the problem asking about the number of prime numbers in the range from \\( n! + 1 \\) to \\( n! + n \\), several thoughts come to mind:\n\n1. **Factorials and Primes:** I know that \\( n! \\) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \\( n \\). This makes \\( n! \\) a highly composite number. Perhaps the properties of factorials can help in identifying primes nearby.\n\n2. **Exploring the Range:** The range specified is from \\( n! + 1 \\) to \\( n! + n \\). It's relatively small compared to \\( n! \\), so maybe there's a pattern or theorem that applies.\n\n3. **Testing Small Cases:** To get a feel for what's happening, trying out small values of \\( n \\) could be helpful.\n\n4. **Recalling Theorems:** Wilson's Theorem and concepts around prime gaps come to mind, but I'm not sure if they directly apply.\n\nHonestly, I'm not certain which approach will work, so I'll start by exploring these ideas one by one.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing the Range \\( n! + 1 \\) to \\( n! + n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's consider each number in the range \\( n! + k \\) where \\( k \\) varies from 1 to \\( n \\). Given that \\( n! \\) is divisible by all integers up to \\( n \\), adding \\( k \\) might affect the divisibility of \\( n! + k \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- For each \\( k \\) where \\( 1 \\leq k \\leq n \\), \\( n! + k \\) is divisible by \\( k \\) because \\( n! \\) is already divisible by \\( k \\).\n\n**Example with \\( n = 5 \\):**\n\n- \\( 5! = 120 \\)\n  - \\( 120 + 1 = 121 \\), divisible by 1\n  - \\( 120 + 2 = 122 \\), divisible by 2\n  - \\( 120 + 3 = 123 \\), divisible by 3\n  - \\( 120 + 4 = 124 \\), divisible by 4\n  - \\( 120 + 5 = 125 \\), divisible by 5\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, this means that for each \\( k \\), \\( n! + k \\) is divisible by \\( k \\). So, unless \\( n! + k \\) equals \\( k \\) itself (which only happens when \\( k = 1 \\)), these numbers are composite.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Potential Primes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGiven the above, it seems that all numbers \\( n! + k \\) for \\( k > 1 \\) are composite because they are divisible by \\( k \\). The only number that might be prime is \\( n! + 1 \\).\n\n**Exploring \\( n! + 1 \\):**\n\n- \\( n! + 1 \\) is not necessarily divisible by any integer up to \\( n \\), so it has the potential to be prime.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis suggests that in the range \\( n! + 1 \\) to \\( n! + n \\), only \\( n! + 1 \\) could be prime. But is it always prime? Let's investigate further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Testing with Small Values of \\( n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo verify whether \\( n! + 1 \\) is always prime, I'll test it with small values of \\( n \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **For \\( n = 2 \\):**  \n  - \\( 2! = 2 \\)  \n  - \\( 2! + 1 = 3 \\), which is **prime**.\n\n- **For \\( n = 3 \\):**  \n  - \\( 3! = 6 \\)  \n  - \\( 6 + 1 = 7 \\), which is **prime**.\n\n- **For \\( n = 4 \\):**  \n  - \\( 4! = 24 \\)  \n  - \\( 24 + 1 = 25 \\), which is **not prime** (\\( 25 = 5^2 \\)).\n\n- **For \\( n = 5 \\):**  \n  - \\( 5! = 120 \\)  \n  - \\( 120 + 1 = 121 \\), which is **not prime** (\\( 121 = 11^2 \\)).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nInteresting! For \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 3 \\), \\( n! + 1 \\) is prime, but for \\( n = 4 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\), it's not. This indicates that \\( n! + 1 \\) is not always prime.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Generalizing the Observation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGiven that \\( n! + 1 \\) is not always prime and all other numbers in the range \\( n! + 2 \\) to \\( n! + n \\) are composite, it seems that there might be cases where there's no prime at all in the range.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis aligns with the possibility of having zero primes in the range for certain \\( n \\). However, since \\( n! + 1 \\) can be prime for some values of \\( n \\), we need to account for that as well.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Evaluating Answer Choices**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's consider each answer choice based on our findings:\n\n- **(A) 0:** This would mean there are no primes in the range. However, we've seen that for \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 3 \\), \\( n! + 1 \\) is prime. So, this can't be universally correct.\n\n- **(B) 1:** This suggests that there is always at most one prime in the range. Given that \\( n! + 1 \\) is sometimes prime and all other numbers are composite, this seems plausible.\n\n- **(C) \\(\\frac{n}{2}\\) for \\( n \\) even, \\(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\) for \\( n \\) odd:** This implies multiple primes depending on the parity of \\( n \\), which doesn't align with our findings since most numbers in the range are composite.\n\n- **(D) \\( n - 1 \\):** This would mean multiple primes, which again doesn't fit our observations.\n\n- **(E) \\( n \\):** This suggests all numbers in the range are prime, which is definitely not the case.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBased on this analysis, option **(B) 1** is the most accurate: there is at most one prime (\\( n! + 1 \\)) in the range, and sometimes none.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Conclusion with More Examples**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure the conclusion is correct, let's test a few more cases:\n\n- **For \\( n = 6 \\):**  \n  - \\( 6! = 720 \\)  \n  - \\( 720 + 1 = 721 \\), which is **not prime** (\\( 721 = 7 \\times 103 \\)).\n\n- **For \\( n = 7 \\):**  \n  - \\( 7! = 5040 \\)  \n  - \\( 5040 + 1 = 5041 \\), which is **not prime** (\\( 5041 = 71^2 \\)).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThese additional examples reinforce that \\( n! + 1 \\) is not always prime. Therefore, the conclusion that there is at most one prime in the range holds.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's do a quick sanity check:\n\n- All numbers \\( n! + k \\) for \\( k > 1 \\) are composite because they are divisible by \\( k \\).\n- \\( n! + 1 \\) is the only candidate for being prime, but it depends on \\( n \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything aligns with our earlier analysis. The pattern is consistent across multiple examples.\n\n**<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER>B</ANSWER>:  \nThere is at most **one** prime number greater than \\( n! + 1 \\) and less than \\( n! + n \\), specifically at \\( n! + 1 \\), and only if \\( n! + 1 \\) is prime.  \nHence, the correct answer is **(B) 1**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically analyzing the range \\( n! + 1 \\) to \\( n! + n \\), testing small cases, and reflecting on the properties of factorials and primes, we've determined that:\n\n- All numbers \\( n! + k \\) for \\( k > 1 \\) are composite.\n- The only potential prime is \\( n! + 1 \\), but it's not always prime.\n\nTherefore, there is at most one prime in the given range, leading us to conclude with confidence that **(B) 1** is the correct answer.",
  "ground_truth": "Observe that for all $k \\in 1< k< n$, since $k$ divides $n!$, $k$ also divides $n!+k$. Therefore, all numbers $a$ in the range $n!+1<a<n!+n$ are composite. Therefore there are $\\boxed{}$ primes in that range."
