  "solution": "Certainly! Let's approach this problem step-by-step, maintaining the original thought process while ensuring clarity and coherence. I'll start by understanding the problem, brainstorming possible strategies, and then working through each step carefully, incorporating reflections and quick checks along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n- **Understanding the Question:**  \n  We need to express \\(\\tan \\theta\\) in terms of \\(x\\), given:  \n  \\[\n  \\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{x - 1}{2x}}\n  \\]  \n  where \\(\\theta\\) is an acute angle.\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:**  \n  Using trigonometric identities involving \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\) seems promising. Double angle formulas come to mind since they relate \\(\\theta\\) to its half-angle.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**  \n  1. Utilize the double angle identity for cosine.\n  2. Relate \\(\\tan \\theta\\) to \\(\\sin \\theta\\) and \\(\\cos \\theta\\).\n  3. Consider alternative identities if needed.\n\n- **Uncertainty:**  \n  Starting with double angle identities feels right, but I'll need to ensure each step aligns correctly with the final goal.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy: Using Double Angle Identities**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Let's consider the double angle identity for cosine:  \n  \\[\n  \\cos \\theta = 1 - 2\\sin^2 \\frac{\\theta}{2}\n  \\]  \n  Given that we have \\(\\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\), this identity seems useful for finding \\(\\cos \\theta\\). From there, we can determine \\(\\sin \\theta\\) and ultimately \\(\\tan \\theta\\).\n\n- **Proceeding with the Idea:**  \n  Let's apply this identity to see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Double Angle Identity for Cosine**\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  Plug in the given \\(\\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\):  \n  \\[\n  \\cos \\theta = 1 - 2\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{x - 1}{2x}}\\right)^2\n  \\]\n  Simplifying inside the parentheses:  \n  \\[\n  \\cos \\theta = 1 - 2\\left(\\frac{x - 1}{2x}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{x - 1}{x} = \\frac{1}{x}\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Let's verify this step:  \n  \\[\n  1 - \\frac{x - 1}{x} = \\frac{x - (x - 1)}{x} = \\frac{1}{x}\n  \\]  \n  Yup, that simplification is correct!\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This result looks tidy. Having \\(\\cos \\theta = \\frac{1}{x}\\) sets us up nicely for the next steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding \\(\\sin \\theta\\)**\n\n- **Using Pythagorean Identity:**  \n  Recall:  \n  \\[\n  \\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1\n  \\]  \n  So:  \n  \\[\n  \\sin^2 \\theta = 1 - \\cos^2 \\theta = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{x^2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculating \\(\\sin \\theta\\):**  \n  Since \\(\\theta\\) is acute, \\(\\sin \\theta\\) is positive:  \n  \\[\n  \\sin \\theta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{x^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{x}\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Does this make sense? For acute angles, as \\(x\\) increases, \\(\\sin \\theta\\) behaves correctly. No negative values under the square root as long as \\(x \\geq 1\\).  \n  Yep, it checks out!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\(\\tan \\theta\\)**\n\n- **Using the Definition of Tangent:**  \n  \\[\n  \\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{x}}{\\frac{1}{x}} = \\sqrt{x^2 - 1}\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplification:**  \n  The \\(x\\) terms cancel out:  \n  \\[\n  \\tan \\theta = \\sqrt{x^2 - 1}\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Reality Check:**  \n  This makes sense. As \\(x\\) increases, \\(\\tan \\theta\\) increases, aligning with the behavior of tangent for acute angles.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\tan \\theta = \\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Wrapping Up**\n\n- **Reflection on the Approach:**  \n  By correctly applying the double angle identity for cosine and carefully simplifying each step, we arrived at the correct expression for \\(\\tan \\theta\\). Initially, there was an overcomplication, but recognizing and correcting it streamlined the solution.\n\n- **Verifying the Solution:**  \n  Intermediate checks confirmed that each step was accurate. The final expression is simplified and aligns with the given conditions.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:**  \n  Although the first approach succeeded after corrections, considering multiple strategies ensures robustness. Here, the double angle identity for cosine led directly to an efficient solution.\n\n- **Final Thoughts:**  \n  Starting with familiar identities and being open to reevaluating each step ensured a correct and efficient solution. Consistency and correctness at each stage helped avoid errors and validated the final answer.\n\n---\n\nI hope this revised walkthrough provides a clear insight into the thought process, complete with recognizing and correcting initial missteps, reflecting, and verifying along the way.",
