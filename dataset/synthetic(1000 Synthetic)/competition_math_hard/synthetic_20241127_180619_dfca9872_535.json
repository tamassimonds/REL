  "solution": "Sure, let's put everything together into a coherent and complete solution, maintaining the same natural thought process while ensuring clarity and thoroughness. I'll keep the final answer unchanged. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**Alright, so the question is asking for the domain of the function \\( w(x) = \\sqrt{x-2} + \\sqrt[3]{x-3} \\).**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** At first glance, I notice two components involving square and cube roots.\n  - I remember that **square roots** require the expression inside to be **non-negative**.\n  - **Cube roots**, on the other hand, can handle **negative values** without any issues.\n- This reminds me of previous problems where ensuring the validity of expressions under roots was key to determining the domain.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Consider Each Term Separately:**\n   - Find the domain for \\( \\sqrt{x-2} \\) and \\( \\sqrt[3]{x-3} \\) individually, then see how they combine.\n   \n2. **Look for Common Restrictions:**\n   - Determine if there\u2019s an overlap in the conditions required for both terms to be defined.\n\n3. **Graphical Approach:**\n   - Sketching or visualizing the functions might help to see where \\( w(x) \\) is defined.\n\n**Leaning Towards:**\n\n- **Starting by Analyzing Each Term Separately:** This seems straightforward and a good place to begin.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing \\( \\sqrt{x-2} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **I know that for a square root, the expression inside must be non-negative.**\n  - This means I need to set up an inequality to ensure \\( x-2 \\) is at least zero.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx - 2 \\geq 0 \\implies x \\geq 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This makes sense because if \\( x \\) is less than 2, \\( \\sqrt{x-2} \\) would be imaginary, which isn\u2019t allowed for real-valued functions.\n- **Conclusion:** The domain for this part is \\( x \\geq 2 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing \\( \\sqrt[3]{x-3} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Cube roots are more flexible because they accept negative numbers as well.**\n  - Therefore, there\u2019s **no restriction** on \\( x \\) for this term.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- No inequality is needed here. The domain is all real numbers: \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- That\u2019s straightforward. \\( \\sqrt[3]{x-3} \\) is defined everywhere.\n- **Conclusion:** No additional constraints from this term.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combining the Domains**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Now, I need to combine the domains from both components.**\n  - The overall domain of \\( w(x) \\) would be where **both** terms are defined.\n  - Since \\( \\sqrt{x-2} \\) requires \\( x \\geq 2 \\), and \\( \\sqrt[3]{x-3} \\) has no restrictions, the limiting factor is \\( x \\geq 2 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Final Domain:** \\( x \\geq 2 \\)\n- In interval notation: \\([2, \\infty)\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Let me double-check that:** \n  - If \\( x \\geq 2 \\), both \\( \\sqrt{x-2} \\) and \\( \\sqrt[3]{x-3} \\) are defined.\n  - Seems correct\u2014no conflicts here.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Graphical Interpretation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Just to be sure, maybe visualizing the functions could help.**\n  - I can imagine the graphs of \\( \\sqrt{x-2} \\) and \\( \\sqrt[3]{x-3} \\).\n\n**Visualization:**\n\n- **\\( \\sqrt{x-2} \\):** Starts at \\( x = 2 \\) and increases.\n- **\\( \\sqrt[3]{x-3} \\):** Extends infinitely in both directions, centered at \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The combined function \\( w(x) \\) is only restricted by \\( \\sqrt{x-2} \\).\n- **Conclusion:** The domain is indeed \\( x \\geq 2 \\). The graphical approach confirms it.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Validating the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Let me take a sample value within the domain and see if \\( w(x) \\) is defined.**\n  - **Example:** Let\u2019s try \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nw(3) = \\sqrt{3-2} + \\sqrt[3]{3-3} = \\sqrt{1} + \\sqrt[3]{0} = 1 + 0 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The function evaluates to 1, which is a real number.\n- **Conclusion:** This confirms that \\( w(x) \\) is indeed defined at \\( x = 3 \\).\n- **Everything checks out!**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThe domain of the function \\( w(x) = \\sqrt{x-2} + \\sqrt[3]{x-3} \\) is \\([2, \\infty)\\).  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **By Analyzing Each Component Separately:**  \n  - I determined that \\( \\sqrt{x-2} \\) imposes a restriction of \\( x \\geq 2 \\).\n  - \\( \\sqrt[3]{x-3} \\) poses no additional constraints as it is defined for all real numbers.\n\n- **Combining These Insights:**  \n  - The overall domain of \\( w(x) \\) is thus \\([2, \\infty)\\).\n\n- **Validation Through Sample Calculation:**  \n  - Checking \\( w(x) \\) at \\( x = 3 \\) confirmed that the function is well-defined within the determined domain.\n\n- **Alternative Graphical Approach:**  \n  - Visualizing the functions reinforced the conclusion that the domain is \\( x \\geq 2 \\).\n\n**I hope this step-by-step exploration helps in understanding how to approach such problems naturally, reflecting and checking at each stage to ensure accuracy.**\n\n---\n\nBy structuring the solution this way, we maintain a clear and logical progression of thoughts, making it easy to follow and ensuring that each step is thoroughly validated before arriving at the final answer.",
  "ground_truth": "Note that $\\sqrt[3]{x-3}$ is defined for all $x$. The only restriction is due to the $\\sqrt{x-2}$ term, which is defined only if $x-2$ is nonnegative. Thus, the domain of $w(x)$ is $\\boxed{[2,\\infty)}$."
