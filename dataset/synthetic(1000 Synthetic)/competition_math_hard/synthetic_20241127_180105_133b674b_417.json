  "problem": "In how many ways is it possible to arrange the digits of 1150 to get a four-digit multiple of 5?",
  "solution": "### Step 1: Understanding the Question\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. We're tasked with rearranging the digits of **1150** to form a four-digit number that's a multiple of **5**. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- A number is a multiple of **5** if it ends in **0** or **5**.\n- We've got four digits, including a **0**, which means we need to be careful not to start the number with **0** (since that would make it a three-digit number).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Listing all possible permutations could work, but that might be tedious and prone to errors.\n- Instead, focusing on fixing the last digit as **0** or **5** seems more efficient.\n- Need to ensure that the number doesn't start with **0** to maintain it as a four-digit number.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies\n\n**Strategy 1: List All Permutations**\n\n- **Thought:** Listing all arrangements and checking which ones are multiples of **5**.\n- **Challenge:** With repeated digits (**1s**), some permutations repeat, and it's easy to double-count or miss some.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Hmm**, this approach is time-consuming and error-prone. Perhaps there's a better way.\n\n**Strategy 2: Fix the Last Digit as 0 or 5**\n\n- **Thought:** Since the number must end in **0** or **5**, let's handle each case separately.\n  \n  - **Case 1:** Last digit is **0**\n  - **Case 2:** Last digit is **5**\n\nThis seems more structured. Let's proceed with this strategy.\n\n### Step 3: Case 1 - Last Digit is 0\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf the last digit is **0**, the number is automatically a multiple of **5**. So, we need to arrange the remaining three digits (**1, 1, 5**) in the first three positions.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- The number can't start with **0**, so this setup is valid.\n- There's a repetition of the digit **1**, so we need to account for that in permutations.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Number of ways to arrange **1, 1, 5**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total permutations} = \\frac{3!}{2!} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Okay**, that makes sense. There are three unique ways to arrange **1, 1, 5**.\n\n**Possible Arrangements:**\n1. **1150**\n2. **1510**\n3. **5110**\n\n**Check:**\n- All are four-digit numbers ending in **0**, making them valid multiples of **5**.\n\n**Conclusion for Case 1:**\n- **3** valid arrangements.\n\n### Step 4: Case 2 - Last Digit is 5\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the last digit is **5**. We need to arrange the remaining three digits (**1, 1, 0**) in the first three positions.\n\n**Concerns:**\n- If **0** is in the leading position, it would reduce the number to a three-digit number, which isn't acceptable.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Total permutations of **1, 1, 0** without restrictions:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total permutations} = \\frac{3!}{2!} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \n\\]\n\n**Possible Arrangements:**\n1. **1105**\n2. **1015**\n3. **0115**\n\n**Check:**\n- **0115** starts with **0**, making it a three-digit number, so it's invalid.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Hmm**, only two valid arrangements here because **0115** starts with **0**.\n\n**Conclusion for Case 2:**\n- **2** valid arrangements: **1105** and **1015**.\n\n### Step 5: Summing Up the Valid Arrangements\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, let's combine the valid arrangements from both cases.\n\n- **Case 1:** 3 valid numbers\n- **Case 2:** 2 valid numbers\n\n**Total Valid Arrangements:**\n\n\\[\n3 (\\text{from Case 1}) + 2 (\\text{from Case 2}) = 5 \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Listing them to ensure correctness:\n  1. **1150**\n  2. **1510**\n  3. **5110**\n  4. **1105**\n  5. **1015**\n\n- All end in **0** or **5** and are four-digit numbers. **0115** was discarded earlier.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- By breaking it into two cases and accounting for repetitions, the solution is both accurate and efficient.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<ANSWER>  \n**5** valid arrangements: **1150**, **1510**, **5110**, **1105**, **1015**  \n</ANSWER>\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Initially considered listing all permutations but realized it was inefficient. \n- Focusing on fixing the last digit streamlined the process.\n- Ensuring that **0** wasn't a leading digit was crucial to maintaining four-digit validity.\n\n**Check:**\n- Regular checks throughout ensured correctness, and dividing the problem into manageable cases made the solution straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Brainstorming different strategies helped identify the most effective approach. By fixing the last digit and carefully handling leading zeros, all valid arrangements were accurately counted, leading to the final answer of **5** valid arrangements.",
  "ground_truth": "A multiple of 5 has to end in 0 or 5. If it ends in 0, the three remaining digits can go anywhere. There are 3! ways to arrange 3 digits, but we must divide by 2! to correct for overcounting since the 1's are identical. If the number ends in 5, the digit 0 can go in either of 2 places. Then the two remaining digits can go anywhere. There are 2! ways to arrange 2 digits, but we must divide this by 2! to correct for overcounting since the 1's are identical. So, there are $3!/2!+2\\cdot 2!/2!=3+2=\\boxed{5}$ possible ways to arrange the digits of 1150 to get a four-digit multiple of 5."
