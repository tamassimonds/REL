  "problem": "The students in Mrs. Reed's English class are reading the same $760$-page novel. Three friends, Alice, Bob and Chandra, are in the class. Alice reads a page in $20$ seconds, Bob reads a page in $45$ seconds and Chandra reads a page in $30$ seconds.   Chandra and Bob, who each have a copy of the book, decide that they can save time by `team reading' the novel. In this scheme, Chandra will read from page $1$ to a certain page and Bob will read from the next page through page $760,$ finishing the book. When they are through they will tell each other about the part they read. What is the last page that Chandra should read so that she and Bob spend the same amount of time reading the novel?",
  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's consolidate the thought process into a cohesive and comprehensive solution while maintaining the original answer. \n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nThree friends are tackling a 760-page novel at different reading speeds:\n\n- **Alice:** Reads the fastest at 20 seconds per page.\n- **Chandra:** Reads at 30 seconds per page.\n- **Bob:** Reads at 45 seconds per page.\n\nGiven their speeds, Chandra and Bob decide to team up to save time. Chandra reads from the beginning up to a certain page, and Bob takes over from there until the end. The goal is to determine the last page Chandra should read so that both Chandra and Bob spend the same amount of time reading.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen faced with this problem, a few strategies come to mind:\n\n1. **Calculating Individual Reading Times:** Determine how long Chandra and Bob would each take to read the entire book on their own. This might provide insight into how to split their reading time appropriately.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Create an equation where Chandra and Bob's reading times are equal, reflecting their different speeds.\n\n3. **Proportional Splits:** Consider dividing the book based on the ratio of their reading speeds to balance the time spent.\n\nAt first glance, calculating individual reading times seems straightforward, but it may not directly lead to the solution. Let's explore this approach to see if it helps.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Calculating Total Reading Times Individually**\n\n#### **Thought Process**\n\nStart by determining how long each would take to read the entire book:\n\n- **Chandra's Total Reading Time:**\n  \\[\n  760 \\text{ pages} \\times 30 \\text{ seconds per page} = 22,800 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Bob's Total Reading Time:**\n  \\[\n  760 \\text{ pages} \\times 45 \\text{ seconds per page} = 34,200 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n\n#### **Reflection**\n\nChandra is faster than Bob, taking significantly less time to read the entire book. However, this information alone doesn't indicate how to split the book between them to equalize their reading times. Thus, this approach doesn't directly lead us to the solution. Time to consider a different strategy.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Setting Up an Equation for Equal Reading Times**\n\n#### **Thought Process**\n\nLet's set up an equation where the time Chandra spends reading equals the time Bob spends reading. This approach seems more promising as it directly addresses the problem's requirement.\n\n- **Define Variables:**\n  - Let \\( x \\) be the last page Chandra reads.\n  - Chandra reads pages 1 to \\( x \\).\n  - Bob reads pages \\( x + 1 \\) to 760.\n\n#### **Calculating Reading Times**\n\n- **Chandra's Time:**\n  \\[\n  x \\text{ pages} \\times 30 \\text{ seconds per page} = 30x \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Bob's Time:**\n  \\[\n  (760 - x) \\text{ pages} \\times 45 \\text{ seconds per page} = 45(760 - x) \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n  \n#### **Setting Up the Equation**\n\nTo ensure both spend the same amount of time reading:\n\\[\n30x = 45(760 - x)\n\\]\n\n#### **Solving the Equation**\n\n1. **Expand the Right Side:**\n   \\[\n   30x = 34,200 - 45x\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Bring All \\( x \\) Terms Together:**\n   \\[\n   30x + 45x = 34,200 \\implies 75x = 34,200\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{34,200}{75} = 456\n   \\]\n   \n#### **Reflection**\n\nThis calculation suggests that Chandra should read up to page 456. To ensure correctness, let's perform a quick validation.\n\n### **Quick Check to Validate the Solution**\n\n#### **Thought Process**\n\nVerify whether this split truly balances their reading times by calculating the actual time each spends reading.\n\n- **Chandra's Time:**\n  \\[\n  456 \\times 30 = 13,680 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Bob's Time:**\n  \\[\n  (760 - 456) \\times 45 = 304 \\times 45 = 13,680 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n  \n#### **Reflection**\n\nBoth Chandra and Bob spend exactly 13,680 seconds reading, confirming that the solution is correct. This validation step is crucial to ensure that our equation accurately reflects the problem's requirements.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>Chandra should read up to page 456.</ANSWER>\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, I determined that setting up an equation to equalize the reading times of Chandra and Bob was the most effective approach. Solving this equation led to the conclusion that Chandra should read up to page 456 to ensure both spend the same amount of time reading.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nIt's important to note that Alice, who reads the fastest, is not directly involved in this team reading setup. Her speed doesn't impact the calculations between Chandra and Bob, so the solution remains valid.\n\n**Final Reflection:** \n\nInitial brainstorming helped identify multiple strategies, but only by attempting and evaluating each approach did I arrive at the correct solution. Setting up and solving an equation based on equal reading times proved to be the most efficient method, with a quick validation step ensuring accuracy.",
  "ground_truth": "The ratio of time it takes Bob to read a page to the time it takes Chandra to read a page is $45:30$ or $3:2,$ so Bob should read $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the number of pages that Chandra reads. Divide the book into $5$ parts, each with $\\frac{760}{5}=152$ pages. Chandra will read the first $3\\cdot152 =\\boxed{456}$ pages, while Bob reads the last $2\\cdot152=304$ pages."
