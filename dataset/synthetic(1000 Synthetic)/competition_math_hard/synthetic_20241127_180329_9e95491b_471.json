  "problem": "The quadratic $-6x^2+36x+216$ can be written in the form $a(x+b)^2+c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. What is $a+b+c$?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, exploring different strategies, reflecting, and checking for correctness along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, the question asks us to rewrite the quadratic \n\\(-6x^2 + 36x + 216\\)\n in the form \n\\(a(x+b)^2+c\\)\n. I recognize this as completing the square, a method I\u2019ve used before to transform quadratics. The goal is to express the quadratic in a way that makes it easier to identify its vertex and other properties.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other methods too. I could try factoring or using the vertex formula directly. Let me brainstorm a bit.\n\n**Completing the Square:** This seems like the most straightforward approach since the desired form resembles completing the square.\n**Using the Vertex Formula:** I could find the vertex \n\\((h, k)\\)\n and rewrite the quadratic accordingly.\n**Factoring:** Maybe factoring the quadratic first could help, but looking at the coefficients, factoring might be messy.\nI\u2019ll start with **completing the square** because it directly aligns with the form we need. If that doesn\u2019t work, I can try another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nLet's list out the steps for completing the square:\n\n**Factor out the leading coefficient:** Make the coefficient of \n\\(x^2\\)\n equal to 1 by factoring it out.\n**Complete the square for the \n\\(x\\)\n terms:** Add and subtract the necessary term inside the parentheses to make a perfect square.\n**Simplify the expression:** Combine constants outside the square.\nDoes this make sense? Yeah, I think so. Let's proceed with the first step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Factoring Out the Leading Coefficient**\n\nGiven quadratic:\n\n \n\u22126x2+36x+216\n\u2212\n6\nx\n2\n +\n36\nx\n +\n216\n\u200b\n\n \n\nThought process: Wait, the leading coefficient is \n\\(-6\\)\n. To make completing the square easier, I should factor \n\\(-6\\)\n out of the \n\\(x^2\\)\n and \n\\(x\\)\n terms.\n\nLet's see how that looks:\n\n \n\u22126(x2\u22126x)+216\n\u2212\n6\n(\nx\n2\n \u2212\n6\nx\n)\n +\n216\n\u200b\n\n \n\nReflection: Hmm, factoring out \n\\(-6\\)\n from \n\\(36x\\)\n gives me \n\\(-6x\\)\n inside the parentheses, which seems correct. The constant term \n\\(216\\)\n stays outside for now.\n\nQuick check: If I distribute \n\\(-6\\)\n back, do I get the original quadratic?\n\n \n\u22126(x2)=\u22126x2\n\u2212\n6\n(\nx\n2\n)\n =\n\u2212\n6\nx\n2\n\nand\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u22126(\u22126x)=36x\n\u2212\n6\n(\n\u2212\n6\nx\n)\n =\n36\nx\n\u200b\n\n \nYep, that works. So far, so good.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Completing the Square**\n\nNow, I need to complete the square inside the parentheses.\n\nExpression so far:\n\n \n\u22126(x2\u22126x)+216\n\u2212\n6\n(\nx\n2\n \u2212\n6\nx\n)\n +\n216\n\u200b\n\n \n\nThought process: To complete the square, I take the coefficient of \n\\(x\\)\n (which is \n\\(-6\\)\n), divide it by 2, and square it.\n\nCalculations:\n\n \n(\u221262)2=(\u22123)2=9\n(\n\u2212\n6\n2\n)\n2\n =\n(\n\u2212\n3\n)\n2\n =\n9\n\u200b\n\n \n\nReflection: Alright, I need to add and subtract \n\\(9\\)\n inside the parentheses to form a perfect square.\n\nBut wait, since I factored out \n\\(-6\\)\n, adding \n\\(9\\)\n inside actually affects the expression outside. I need to account for that.\n\nAdjusted expression:\n\n \n\u22126(x2\u22126x+9\u22129)+216\n\u2212\n6\n(\nx\n2\n \u2212\n6\nx\n +\n9\n \u2212\n9\n)\n +\n216\n\u200b\n\n \n\n \n=\u22126((x2\u22126x+9)\u22129)+216\n=\n\u2212\n6\n(\n(\nx\n2\n \u2212\n6\nx\n +\n9\n)\n \u2212\n9\n)\n +\n216\n\u200b\n\n \n\nSimplifying:\n\n \n=\u22126(x\u22123)2+54+216\n=\n\u2212\n6\n(\nx\n \u2212\n3\n)\n2\n +\n54\n +\n216\n\u200b\n\n \n\n \n=\u22126(x\u22123)2+270\n=\n\u2212\n6\n(\nx\n \u2212\n3\n)\n2\n +\n270\n\u200b\n\n \n\nWait, let me double-check that. Did I handle the constant term correctly?\n\nQuick check: By factoring out \n\\(-6\\)\n, multiplying it by \n\\(-9\\)\n gives:\n\n \n\u22126\u00d7(\u22129)=54\n\u2212\n6\n\u00d7\n(\n\u2212\n9\n)\n =\n54\n\u200b\n\n \n\nAdding \n\\(54\\)\n to \n\\(216\\)\n indeed gives \n\\(270\\)\n.\n\nAlright, that seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Writing in the Desired Form**\n\nNow, our expression looks like:\n\n \n\u22126(x\u22123)2+270\n\u2212\n6\n(\nx\n \u2212\n3\n)\n2\n +\n270\n\u200b\n\n \n\nThis matches the form \n\\(a(x+b)^2+c\\)\n where:\n\n \na=\u22126,b=\u22123,c=270\na\n=\n\u2212\n6\n,\nb\n=\n\u2212\n3\n,\nc\n=\n270\n\u200b\n\n \n\nThought process: To find \n\\(a+b+c\\)\n, I just need to add these constants together.\n\nCalculations:\n\n \na+b+c=\u22126+(\u22123)+270=\u22129+270=261\na\n+\nb\n+\nc\n=\n\u2212\n6\n+\n(\n\u2212\n3\n)\n+\n270\n=\n\u2212\n9\n+\n270\n=\n261\n\u200b\n\n \n\nReflection: That seems straightforward. But let me do a quick sanity check to ensure everything adds up correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\nLet\u2019s substitute back to see if our transformed expression equals the original quadratic.\n\nExpanded form:\n\n \n\u22126(x\u22123)2+270\n\u2212\n6\n(\nx\n \u2212\n3\n)\n2\n +\n270\n\u200b\n\n \n\nExpanding the square:\n\n \n=\u22126(x2\u22126x+9)+270\n=\n\u2212\n6\n(\nx\n2\n \u2212\n6\nx\n +\n9\n)\n +\n270\n\u200b\n\n \n\nDistributing \n\\(-6\\)\n:\n\n \n=\u22126x2+36x\u221254+270\n=\n\u2212\n6\nx\n2\n +\n36\nx\n \u2212\n54\n +\n270\n\u200b\n\n \n\nCombining constants:\n\n \n=\u22126x2+36x+216\n=\n\u2212\n6\nx\n2\n +\n36\nx\n +\n216\n\u200b\n\n \n\nWait a minute, that\u2019s exactly our original quadratic!\n\nQuick check: Yep, everything checks out. The transformation is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nRecapping the steps:\n\n**Factored out the leading coefficient:** Simplified the expression to make completing the square easier.\n**Completed the square:** Added and subtracted the necessary term inside the parentheses.\n**Simplified the expression:** Accounted for the constant term affected by factoring.\n**Verified the transformation:** Expanded back to ensure it matched the original quadratic.\nThroughout the process, I kept checking each step to ensure correctness, adjusting as needed.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>\n\n261\n\nSo, the final answer is\n\n\\(a+b+c=261\\)\n\n.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n### **Final Checks**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me reflect once more:\n\n**Did I account for all terms correctly?**\n\u00a0Yes, each step aligns with the original quadratic.\n\n**Is the calculation of \n\\(a+b+c\\)\n accurate?**\n\u00a0Adding \n\\(-6\\)\n, \n\\(-3\\)\n, and \n\\(270\\)\n gives \n\\(261\\)\n, which is correct.\n\n**Does the transformed expression revert back to the original when expanded?**\n\u00a0Absolutely, expanding the completed square returns the original quadratic.\n\nAlright, everything seems to be in order. The final answer is\n\n**261**\n\n.\n\n<ANSWER>\n\n261\n\nSo, the final answer is\n\n\\(a+b+c=261\\)\n\n.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\nThat's it!\n\nHope this step-by-step approach helps clarify the process.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!\n\n---\n\n---",
  "ground_truth": "We complete the square.\n\nFactoring $-6$ out of the quadratic and linear terms gives $-6x^2 + 36x = -6(x^2-6x)$.\n\nSince $(x-3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9$, we can write $$-6(x-3)^2 = -6x^2 + 36x - 54.$$This quadratic agrees with the given $-6x^2 + 36x + 216$ in all but the constant term. We can write\n\n\\begin{align*}\n-6x^2 + 36x + 216 &= (-6x^2 + 36x - 54) + 270 \\\\\n&= -6(x-3)^2 + 270.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a=-6$, $b=-3$, $c=270$, and $a+b+c = -6-3+270 = \\boxed{261}$."
