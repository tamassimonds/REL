  "solution": "Certainly! Let's transform the iterative problem-solving process into a concise, complete solution while maintaining the original thought flow. We'll keep the final answer intact but present it in a more streamlined manner.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem Statement**\n\nWe have a sphere inscribed in a right cone with a base radius of \\(12\\) cm and a height of \\(24\\) cm. Determine the radius of the sphere expressed in the form \\(a\\sqrt{c} - a\\) cm, and find the value of \\(a + c\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- We need to find the radius of a sphere perfectly fitting inside a right cone.\n- Given dimensions: base radius (\\(R\\)) = \\(12\\) cm, height (\\(h\\)) = \\(24\\) cm.\n- The solution requires expressing the sphere's radius in a specific algebraic form.\n\n**Initial Reflection:**\n\nThis reminds me of geometric relationships involving inscribed shapes. Perhaps using similar triangles or direct geometric formulas could help. Let's explore different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Similar Triangles:**\n   - Concept: Utilize proportional relationships within the cone and sphere.\n   \n2. **Volume Ratios:**\n   - Concept: Relate the volumes of the sphere and cone.\n   \n3. **Slant Height Utilization:**\n   - Concept: Involve the cone\u2019s slant height in the calculations.\n   \n4. **Trigonometry:**\n   - Concept: Use angles to relate the cone\u2019s dimensions to the sphere\u2019s radius.\n\n**Choice:**\n\nI'll start with **similar triangles** since inscribed shapes often lead to proportional relationships. If this path doesn't work, I can switch to other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Attempting Similar Triangles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Draw a cross-section through the cone\u2019s axis, forming a right triangle.\n- The sphere touches the cone\u2019s base and sides, suggesting proportional relationships.\n\n**Creating the Right Triangle:**\n\n- **Base:** \\(12\\) cm (half the cone\u2019s diameter).\n- **Height:** \\(24\\) cm.\n- **Hypotenuse:** Slant height (\\(l\\)) of the cone.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nFirst, find the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nl = \\sqrt{12^2 + 24^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 576} = \\sqrt{720} = 12\\sqrt{5} \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n**Applying Similar Triangles:**\n\n- Identify smaller triangles formed by the sphere\u2019s radius (\\(r\\)) and parts of the cone\u2019s dimensions.\n- Attempt to set up proportional relationships.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r}{\\text{part of the base}} = \\frac{r}{\\text{part of the height}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, the proportions aren't straightforward here. The smaller triangle isn't clearly defined, leading to confusion. This indicates that **similar triangles** might not be the best approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Trying a Different Approach \u2013 Using Height Ratios**\n\n**New Idea:**\n\nFocus on the fact that the sphere is tangent to both the base and sides of the cone. This might lead to a relationship involving the cone\u2019s dimensions and the sphere\u2019s radius.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The sphere is tangent to the cone\u2019s base at the bottom.\n- It's also tangent to the cone\u2019s sides at some height.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nPerhaps expressing the height at which the sphere touches the cone\u2019s sides in terms of the sphere\u2019s radius would help.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nStill not clear. It's challenging to visualize how the sphere interacts with the cone's sides. This suggests that **height ratios** alone aren't sufficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Switching to Trigonometry**\n\n**New Approach:**\n\nUse trigonometry to relate the cone\u2019s angles to the sphere\u2019s radius.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Consider the apex angle of the cone.\n- The sphere touches the cone\u2019s sides, so angles might help relate the dimensions.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nFind the cone\u2019s apex angle (\\(\\theta\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{12}{24} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Applying Trigonometry:**\n\nAttempt to relate the sphere\u2019s radius (\\(r\\)) to the cone\u2019s dimensions using sine or cosine of the apex angle.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nStill stuck. There's no direct way to connect \\(r\\) with \\(\\theta\\). **Trigonometry** might not be the right path.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Realizing the Need for a Better Strategy**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth **similar triangles** and **trigonometry** aren't leading to a solution. Time to think differently.\n\n**New Idea:**\n\nRecall that for a sphere inscribed in a cone, there's a specific geometric formula relating the sphere\u2019s radius to the cone\u2019s dimensions. Let's derive or utilize that relationship.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The sphere is tangent to the cone\u2019s base and sides.\n- Consider the distance from the cone\u2019s apex to the center of the sphere.\n\n**Proceeding:**\n\nLet's explore this further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Using the Pythagorean Theorem in 3D**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Consider the center of the sphere.\n- Draw a line from the apex of the cone to the center of the sphere.\n- This line is perpendicular to the base and passes through the sphere's center.\n\n**Creating the Setup:**\n\n- **\\(O\\):** Apex of the cone.\n- **\\(C\\):** Center of the sphere.\n- **\\(A\\):** Point where the sphere touches the base.\n\n\\[\nOC = \\text{vertical line} = 24 - r\n\\]\n\\[\nCA = r\n\\]\n\\[\nOA = \\text{slant height} = 12\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\n**Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n\n\\[\n(24 - r)^2 + r^2 = (12\\sqrt{5})^2\n\\]\n\n**Expanding the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n576 - 48r + r^2 + r^2 = 720\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2r^2 - 48r + 576 = 720\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2r^2 - 48r - 144 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\nDivide the entire equation by \\(2\\):\n\n\\[\nr^2 - 24r - 72 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis quadratic equation looks solvable, but let\u2019s ensure the setup is correct before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nUse the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -24\\), and \\(c = -72\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{24 \\pm \\sqrt{576 + 288}}{2} = \\frac{24 \\pm \\sqrt{864}}{2} = \\frac{24 \\pm 12\\sqrt{6}}{2} = 12 \\pm 6\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\n**Interpreting the Solutions:**\n\n- **\\(r = 12 + 6\\sqrt{6}\\):** This makes the sphere\u2019s radius larger than the cone\u2019s height, which doesn't make sense physically.\n- **\\(r = 12 - 6\\sqrt{6}\\):** This is a viable solution within the cone\u2019s dimensions.\n\n\\[\nr = 12 - 6\\sqrt{6} \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe negative value ensures the sphere fits within the cone. However, this doesn't completely match the required form \\(a\\sqrt{c} - a\\). Let\u2019s rearrange it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Rearranging the Solution to Fit the Given Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nExpress the solution in the desired format \\(a\\sqrt{c} - a\\).\n\n**Current Solution:**\n\n\\[\nr = 12 - 6\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\n**Rewriting:**\n\nFactor out \\(6\\):\n\n\\[\nr = 6(2 - \\sqrt{6})\n\\]\n\n**Wait, That Doesn't Fit Perfectly:**\n\nThis doesn't align directly with \\(a\\sqrt{c} - a\\). Perhaps the initial setup needs re-evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Revisiting the Original Equation**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe quadratic approach led to a correct numerical solution but didn't match the required algebraic form. Maybe the proportional relationships were misconfigured.\n\n**New Idea:**\n\nInstead of using the Pythagorean theorem directly, let's set up the proportions correctly by considering the geometry involved.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The sphere touches the cone\u2019s base and sides, creating tangents.\n- Properly identifying the right triangles involved is crucial.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 11: Correctly Setting Up Proportions**\n\n**New Approach:**\n\nRe-examine the similar triangles to ensure correct proportional relationships.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The height from the apex to the center of the sphere is \\(24 - r\\).\n- The horizontal distance is \\(12 - r\\), considering the sphere\u2019s radius.\n\n**Setting Up the Correct Proportion:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r}{12 - r} = \\frac{12}{24} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Solving the Proportion:**\n\n\\[\n2r = 12 - r \\implies 2r + r = 12 \\implies 3r = 12 \\implies r = 4 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, this leads to a simple integer value, which doesn't align with the complex expression required by the problem. This suggests the proportion was still incorrectly identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 12: Realizing the Need for an Alternative Method**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe proportional method is yielding an unexpected simple solution, which indicates a misconfiguration in the setup.\n\n**New Idea:**\n\nPerhaps the error lies in the assumption of the horizontal side length. It's time to reconsider and ensure accurate relationships.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The triangle involved should account for the sphere\u2019s interactions with the cone\u2019s sides.\n- Adjust the base length accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 13: Correcting the Setup and Deriving the Relationship**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nRe-analyzing the right triangle formed by:\n\n- Vertical side: \\(24 - r\\)\n- Horizontal side: Adjusted based on the sphere's contact point\n- Hypotenuse: Slant height \\(12\\sqrt{5}\\)\n\n**Correct Proportion:**\n\nRealizing that the earlier proportions were incorrect, let\u2019s derive the correct relationship using direct geometric formulas.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nInstead of using basic proportions, applying a formula specific to inscribed spheres in cones.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 14: Applying the Correct Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFrom geometry, for a sphere inscribed in a right cone, the radius \\(r\\) of the sphere can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{h \\times R}{\\sqrt{h^2 + R^2} + R}\n\\]\n\n**Applying to Our Cone:**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\nh = 24 \\, \\text{cm}, \\quad R = 12 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{24 \\times 12}{\\sqrt{24^2 + 12^2} + 12}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{288}{\\sqrt{576 + 144} + 12}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{288}{\\sqrt{720} + 12}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{288}{12\\sqrt{5} + 12}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{288}{12(\\sqrt{5} + 1)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{24}{\\sqrt{5} + 1}\n\\]\n\n**Rationalizing the Denominator:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{24}{\\sqrt{5} + 1} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{\\sqrt{5} - 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{24(\\sqrt{5} - 1)}{5 - 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{24(\\sqrt{5} - 1)}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 6(\\sqrt{5} - 1)\n\\]\n\n**Matching the Given Form:**\n\n\\[\nr = 6\\sqrt{5} - 6\n\\]\n\nSo, in the form \\(a\\sqrt{c} - a\\), we have:\n\n\\[\na = 6, \\quad c = 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\na + c = 6 + 5 = \\mathbf{11}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 15: Verification and Final Reflection**\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- The derived formula aligns with the given cone dimensions.\n- Rationalization and simplification steps are correct.\n- The final expression matches the required format \\(a\\sqrt{c} - a\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy exploring different strategies\u2014starting with similar triangles and trigonometry, recognizing their limitations, and finally applying a specific geometric formula\u2014I arrived at the correct solution. Reflecting and verifying each step ensured accuracy in the final answer.\n\n\\(<ANSWER>11 solution</ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recap:**\n\n- **Initial Attempts:** Similar triangles and trigonometry were considered but found insufficient.\n- **Reflection:** Recognized inconsistencies and the need for a better approach.\n- **Correct Approach:** Utilized a known geometric relationship for inscribed spheres in cones.\n- **Verification:** Ensured the solution matched the required algebraic form.\n  \n\\(<ANSWER>11 solution</ANSWER>\\)",
