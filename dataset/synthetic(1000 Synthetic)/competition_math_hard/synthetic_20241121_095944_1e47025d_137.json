Only the 5 repeats, while the 4 is non-repeating. I remember dealing with repeating decimals before, but it's been a while. Let's see what strategies might work here.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Algebraic Method:** Using variables to represent the repeating decimal and solving equations to find the fraction.\n  2. **Geometric Series:** Thinking of the repeating part as an infinite series and summing it up.\n  3. **Direct Conversion:** Trying to convert the decimal manually by recognizing patterns.\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards the **Algebraic Method** because I recall it being straightforward for repeating decimals. But I'll keep the other methods in mind in case I need them.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Algebraic Method**\n\nLet's assign a variable to the repeating decimal and set up an equation to eliminate the repeating part. This method worked for me in the past with pure repeating decimals, so it might work here too.\n\n- **Setting It Up:**  \n  Let\u2019s say \\( x = 0.4\\overline{5} \\).  \n  This means \\( x = 0.45555...\\) (with the 5 repeating infinitely).\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Wait, I see that only the 5 is repeating after the decimal point. The 4 is fixed. I think I need to account for that non-repeating part separately.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Creating Two Equations to Eliminate the Repeating Part**\n\nTo eliminate the repeating part, I can multiply \\( x \\) by a power of 10 that shifts the decimal point right past the repeating digits. Since only one digit repeats, multiplying by 10 should work.\n\n- **First Equation:**  \n  Multiply both sides by 10:  \n  \\( 10x = 4.5555...\\)\n\n- **Second Equation:**  \n  The original \\( x = 0.45555...\\)\n\n- **Subtracting Equations:**  \n  \\( 10x - x = 4.5555... - 0.45555... \\)  \n  This simplifies to:  \n  \\( 9x = 4.1 \\)\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\( x = \\frac{4.1}{9} \\)\n\n- **Fraction Simplification:**  \n  Convert \\( 4.1 \\) to a fraction:  \n  \\( 4.1 = \\frac{41}{10} \\)  \n  So,  \n  \\( x = \\frac{41}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{41}{90} \\)\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Let me see if this makes sense by converting \\( \\frac{41}{90} \\) back to a decimal:  \n  \\( \\frac{41}{90} \\approx 0.4555... \\)  \n  Yup, that matches \\( 0.4\\overline{5} \\).\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  **Wait a minute!** When I subtract the equations, I noticed that \\( 10x - x = 9x \\) and on the right side, \\( 4.555... - 0.4555... = 4.1 \\). But looking closer, the decimal parts actually cancel out perfectly, leaving just \\( 4.1 \\). So, dividing both sides by 9 gives \\( x = \\frac{4.1}{9} \\), which simplifies correctly to \\( \\frac{41}{90} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Alternative Approach \u2014 Decomposing the Decimal**\n\nJust to be sure, let's try another method by splitting \\( 0.4\\overline{5} \\) into its non-repeating and repeating parts.\n\n- **Writing It Out:**  \n  \\( 0.4\\overline{5} = 0.4 + 0.0\\overline{5} \\)\n\n- **Converting Each Part to Fractions:**  \n  - **Non-Repeating Part:**  \n    \\( 0.4 = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} \\)\n  \n  - **Repeating Part:**  \n    Let\u2019s find \\( 0.0\\overline{5} \\):  \n    - Let \\( y = 0.0\\overline{5} \\)  \n    - Multiply by 10: \\( 10y = 0.5\\overline{5} \\)  \n    - Subtract: \\( 10y - y = 0.5\\overline{5} - 0.0\\overline{5} \\)  \n      \\( 9y = 0.5 \\)  \n    - So, \\( y = \\frac{0.5}{9} = \\frac{5}{90} = \\frac{1}{18} \\)\n\n- **Adding the Fractions:**  \n  \\( 0.4\\overline{5} = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{18} \\)\n\n- **Finding a Common Denominator:**  \n  - The least common multiple of 5 and 18 is 90.  \n  - Converting both fractions to have a denominator of 90:  \n    - \\( \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2 \\times 18}{5 \\times 18} = \\frac{36}{90} \\)  \n    - \\( \\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{5}{90} \\)\n\n- **Adding Them Together:**  \n  \\( \\frac{36}{90} + \\frac{5}{90} = \\frac{41}{90} \\)\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Converting back to a decimal:  \n  \\( \\frac{41}{90} \\approx 0.4555... \\)  \n  This matches \\( 0.4\\overline{5} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Reflection and Verification**\n\n- **Consistency Check:**  \n  Both methods\u2014the algebraic approach and decomposing the decimal\u2014lead to the same fraction: \\( \\frac{41}{90} \\). This consistency adds confidence that the solution is correct.\n\n- **Preferred Method:**  \n  The algebraic method is more straightforward and quicker, but decomposing the decimal offers a deeper understanding of how the non-repeating and repeating parts contribute to the overall fraction.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\\[ \n0.4\\overline{5} = \\frac{41}{90}\n\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Summary: Journey to the Solution**\n\n- **First Thoughts:**  \n  Recognized \\(0.4\\overline{5}\\) as a repeating decimal with only the 5 repeating. Considered multiple strategies, initially leaning towards the algebraic method.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:**  \n  Started with the algebraic method by setting up equations to eliminate the repeating part. Verified the approach by converting the resulting fraction back to a decimal.\n\n- **Checking Correctness:**  \n  Both the algebraic method and an alternative approach (decomposing the decimal) yielded the same fraction, confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\n- **Final Answer:**  \n  Successfully expressed \\(0.4\\overline{5}\\) as \\( \\frac{41}{90} \\).\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step, reflecting often, and verifying each method's validity, I ensured that the final solution was accurate and reliable.\n\n---\n\nI hope this revised solution meets your requirements by maintaining the original thought process while enhancing clarity and coherence.
