  "solution": "Certainly! Let's tackle this problem step by step, embracing the natural thought process, including brainstorming, checking for correctness, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, the problem is to simplify  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{5} - \\sqrt{20} + \\sqrt{45}\n\\]\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Hmm, this looks like an expression involving square roots. I think simplifying the square roots might help, but I'm not entirely sure how to combine them right away.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  - Maybe I can simplify each square root individually.\n  - Perhaps factoring out common terms could work.\n  - Or maybe rewriting the expression in a different form might help.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not certain which method will be the most efficient, so I'll start by exploring the first idea: simplifying each square root individually.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplifying Each Square Root**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Strategy:** Let\u2019s try simplifying \\(\\sqrt{20}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{45}\\) since \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n- **Wait, How Do I Simplify Square Roots Again?**\n  - I remember that I can simplify square roots by factoring out perfect squares.\n\n**Simplifying \\(\\sqrt{20}\\):**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** What are the factors of 20? I think 4 is a perfect square that divides 20.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{20} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{4} \\times \\sqrt{5} = 2\\sqrt{5}\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does \\(2\\sqrt{5}\\) squared equal 20?  \n  \\((2\\sqrt{5})^2 = 4 \\times 5 = 20\\).  \n  **Reflection:** Yep, that works!\n\n**Simplifying \\(\\sqrt{45}\\):**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Let's see, 45... I think 9 is a perfect square that divides 45.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{45} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{9} \\times \\sqrt{5} = 3\\sqrt{5}\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does \\(3\\sqrt{5}\\) squared equal 45?  \n  \\((3\\sqrt{5})^2 = 9 \\times 5 = 45\\).  \n  **Reflection:** Yep, that\u2019s correct!\n\n**Summary of Step 1:**\n\n- Now the expression becomes:  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{5} - 2\\sqrt{5} + 3\\sqrt{5}\n  \\]\n\n- **Thought:** Hmm, this looks like we can combine like terms. Let's move to the next step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Combining Like Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Strategy:** Since all terms involve \\(\\sqrt{5}\\), I can factor it out and combine the coefficients.\n\n- **Wait, Is This Like Combining Variables in Algebra?**\n  - Exactly! It\u2019s similar to combining \\(x\\) terms: \\(1x - 2x + 3x\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Coefficients are:  \n  \\(1 - 2 + 3\\)\n\n- Performing the addition and subtraction:  \n  \\[\n  1 - 2 = -1  \n  -1 + 3 = 2  \n  \\]\n\n- So, the expression simplifies to:  \n  \\[\n  2\\sqrt{5}\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Reflection:** Let me think... If I combine \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) terms like this, does it make sense?  \n  - Yes, because I\u2019m just adding and subtracting the coefficients in front of \\(\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n**Alternative Check:**\n\n- **Thought:** Maybe I should check by reconstructing the original expression using this simplified form to see if it matches.\n\n- **Reconstruction:**\n  - Original: \\(\\sqrt{5} - \\sqrt{20} + \\sqrt{45}\\)\n  - Simplified: \\(2\\sqrt{5}\\)\n  \n- **Calculating Both Numerically:**\n  - Approximate \\(\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236\\)\n  - Original:  \n    \\[\n    2.236 - \\sqrt{20} + \\sqrt{45} \\approx 2.236 - 4.472 + 6.708 \\approx 4.472\n    \\]\n  - Simplified:  \n    \\[\n    2 \\times 2.236 \\approx 4.472\n    \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion:** Both the original and simplified expressions yield approximately 4.472.  \n  **Reflection:** This confirms that the simplification is correct!\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Ensuring Correctness**\n\n- **Thought:** Before finalizing, let me double-check each step to make sure everything flows logically.\n\n- **Check 1:** Simplification of \\(\\sqrt{20}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{45}\\) is correct as both yielded \\(2\\sqrt{5}\\) and \\(3\\sqrt{5}\\), respectively.\n\n- **Check 2:** Combining like terms worked seamlessly, resulting in \\(2\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n- **Alternative Approach Considered:** Initially thought about factoring out \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) from the entire expression, but simplifying each term individually proved straightforward.\n\n- **Final Check:** Numerical verification matched the simplified expression with the original, reinforcing the correctness.\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\\[\n2\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy simplifying each square root individually and then combining like terms, we successfully reduced the expression  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{5} - \\sqrt{20} + \\sqrt{45}\n\\]  \nto  \n\\[\n2\\sqrt{5}\n\\]\nThroughout the process, regular checks ensured that each step was correct, and alternative strategies were considered to validate the approach.\n\n---\n\nThere we go! By walking through each step thoughtfully and verifying correctness along the way, we've arrived confidently at the simplified expression  \n\\[\n2\\sqrt{5}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Simplify $\\sqrt{20}$ as $\\sqrt{2^2}\\cdot\\sqrt5 = 2\\sqrt5$. Also simplify $\\sqrt{45}$ as $\\sqrt{3^2}\\cdot\\sqrt5 = 3\\sqrt5$. The desired expression is $\\sqrt5-2\\sqrt5+3\\sqrt5 = \\boxed{2\\sqrt5}$."
