  "solution": "Absolutely, let's work through this problem step by step, emulating a natural human thought process. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:**  \n  Hmm, this equation involves factoring and comparing two quadratic expressions. It reminds me of problems where you expand both sides and equate coefficients.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Expand Both Sides:** Expand both expressions and equate the coefficients of corresponding terms.\n  2. **Complete the Square:** Maybe rewriting one side in a different form could help.\n  3. **Plug in Specific Values:** Test specific values for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) to see patterns.\n\n- **Which to Try First?**  \n  Let's start by expanding both sides. It seems the most straightforward approach to see what's happening.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expanding Both Sides**\n\n**Left Side (LS):**  \n\\[\n(x - a)(x - 10) + 1\n\\]  \nFirst, expand the quadratic:  \n\\[\n(x - a)(x - 10) = x^2 - 10x - ax + 10a\n\\]  \nCombine like terms:  \n\\[\n= x^2 - (10 + a)x + 10a\n\\]  \nDon't forget the +1:  \n\\[\n= x^2 - (10 + a)x + 10a + 1\n\\]\n\n**Right Side (RS):**  \n\\[\n(x + b)(x + c)\n\\]  \nExpand it:  \n\\[\n= x^2 + (b + c)x + bc\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow, both sides are quadratics. We can equate the coefficients of corresponding terms since the equation must hold for all \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Equate Coefficients**\n\n**Equating Quadratic Terms:**  \nBoth sides have \\(x^2\\) with coefficient 1, so they match.\n\n**Equating Linear Terms:**  \n\\[\n\\text{LS: } -(10 + a)\n\\]  \n\\[\n\\text{RS: } b + c\n\\]  \nSo,  \n\\[\n-(10 + a) = b + c \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b + c = -(10 + a)\n\\]\n\n**Equating Constant Terms:**  \n\\[\n\\text{LS: } 10a + 1\n\\]  \n\\[\n\\text{RS: } bc\n\\]  \nSo,  \n\\[\n10a + 1 = bc\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGreat! We have two equations:\n\n1. \\(b + c = -(10 + a)\\)\n2. \\(bc = 10a + 1\\)\n\nThis resembles a system of equations that we often see when dealing with roots of quadratics.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Different Strategies to Solve the System**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:**  \n  Maybe express \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) in terms of \\(a\\) using these equations.\n\n- **Wait a Minute:**  \n  But that might get messy. Alternatively, could we recognize this as a quadratic whose roots are \\(b\\) and \\(c\\)?\n\n- **New Idea:**  \n  Let's treat \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) as the roots of a quadratic equation. This approach might streamline things.\n\n**Quadratic Whose Roots Are \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):**  \nGiven:  \n\\[\nb + c = -(10 + a)\n\\]  \n\\[\nbc = 10a + 1\n\\]  \n\nThe quadratic equation is:  \n\\[\nx^2 - (b + c)x + bc = 0\n\\]  \nSubstitute the known sums and products:  \n\\[\nx^2 + (10 + a)x + (10a + 1) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis is interesting. The discriminant of this quadratic must be non-negative for real roots, which could give us conditions on \\(a\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Discriminant**\n\n**Discriminant (\\(\\Delta\\)):**  \n\\[\n\\Delta = (10 + a)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (10a + 1)\n\\]  \n\\[\n= 100 + 20a + a^2 - 40a - 4\n\\]  \n\\[\n= a^2 - 20a + 96\n\\]\n\n**Condition for Real \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):**  \n\\[\n\\Delta \\geq 0\n\\]  \n\\[\n\\Rightarrow a^2 - 20a + 96 \\geq 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWe need to solve this inequality to find the possible values of \\(a\\). Time to factor or use the quadratic formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the Inequality \\(a^2 - 20a + 96 \\geq 0\\)**\n\n**First, Find the Roots of the Quadratic:**  \nUse the quadratic formula:  \n\\[\na = \\frac{-(-20) \\pm \\sqrt{(-20)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 96}}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]  \n\\[\n= \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 - 384}}{2}\n\\]  \n\\[\n= \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{2}\n\\]  \n\\[\n= \\frac{20 \\pm 4}{2}\n\\]  \nSo,  \n\\[\na = 12 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a = 8\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe quadratic factors as \\((a - 12)(a - 8) = 0\\). To satisfy \\(a^2 - 20a + 96 \\geq 0\\), \\(a\\) must be outside the interval \\([8, 12]\\).\n\n**Inequality Solution:**  \n\\[\na \\leq 8 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a \\geq 12\n\\]\n\n**But Wait:**  \nThis suggests that \\(a\\) can be any integer less than or equal to 8 or greater than or equal to 12. However, the sample solution only lists \\(a = 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\). Something's off here.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, maybe I've misinterpreted the inequality's implications. Let's reconsider the situation. Perhaps the inequality needs to be equality, or there's an additional condition I'm missing.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\n- **Alternative Interpretation:**  \n  Maybe the inequality should be equality since we are looking for specific integer values where both sides of the original equation match exactly.\n\n- **New Strategy:**  \n  Instead of \\(\\Delta \\geq 0\\), let's focus on \\(\\Delta = 0\\) to find exact integer solutions.\n\n**Set \\(\\Delta = 0\\):**  \n\\[\na^2 - 20a + 96 = 0\n\\]  \nWe already found that \\(a = 12\\) or \\(a = 8\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis suggests that at \\(a = 8\\) and \\(a = 12\\), the discriminant is zero, meaning \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are equal. Let's see what happens at these points.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Analyzing \\(a = 8\\) and \\(a = 12\\)**\n\n**Case 1: \\(a = 8\\)**\n\n- **Substitute into the Equations:**\n  \\[\n  b + c = -(10 + 8) = -18\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  bc = 10(8) + 1 = 81\n  \\]\n  \n- **Quadratic for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):**\n  \\[\n  x^2 + 18x + 81 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Discriminant:**\n  \\[\n  \\Delta = 18^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 81 = 324 - 324 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Roots:**\n  \\[\n  b = c = -9\n  \\]\n  \n- **Verification:**\n  \\[\n  (x + b)(x + c) = (x - 9)^2 = x^2 - 18x + 81\n  \\]\n  \n- **Left Side at \\(a = 8\\):**\n  \\[\n  (x - 8)(x - 10) + 1 = x^2 - 18x + 80 + 1 = x^2 - 18x + 81\n  \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  Both sides match, so \\(a = 8\\) is a valid solution.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis checks out perfectly. Let's move on to \\(a = 12\\).\n\n**Case 2: \\(a = 12\\)**\n\n- **Substitute into the Equations:**\n  \\[\n  b + c = -(10 + 12) = -22\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  bc = 10(12) + 1 = 121\n  \\]\n  \n- **Quadratic for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):**\n  \\[\n  x^2 + 22x + 121 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Discriminant:**\n  \\[\n  \\Delta = 22^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 121 = 484 - 484 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Roots:**\n  \\[\n  b = c = -11\n  \\]\n  \n- **Verification:**\n  \\[\n  (x + b)(x + c) = (x - 11)^2 = x^2 - 22x + 121\n  \\]\n  \n- **Left Side at \\(a = 12\\):**\n  \\[\n  (x - 12)(x - 10) + 1 = x^2 - 22x + 120 + 1 = x^2 - 22x + 121\n  \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  Both sides match, so \\(a = 12\\) is also a valid solution.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth \\(a = 8\\) and \\(a = 12\\) satisfy the equation. However, the sample solution also includes \\(a = 9, 10, 11\\). Let's investigate further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Investigating \\(a = 9, 10, 11\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Initially, setting \\(\\Delta = 0\\) only gave us \\(a = 8\\) and \\(a = 12\\). But the sample solution includes additional values. Perhaps there's more to the problem.\n\n- **Alternative Approach:**  \n  Maybe the inequality \\(\\Delta \\geq 0\\) allows for additional integer values within the range where the discriminant is non-negative, ensuring real roots for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n- **New Strategy:**  \n  Let's reconsider the inequality \\(a^2 - 20a + 96 \\geq 0\\) and see if there are other integer values of \\(a\\) within this range that satisfy the original equation.\n\n**Solving the Inequality Again:**  \n\\[\n(a - 12)(a - 8) \\geq 0\n\\]  \nThis inequality holds for \\(a \\leq 8\\) or \\(a \\geq 12\\). However, the sample solution lists \\(a = 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\). This suggests that within \\(8 \\leq a \\leq 12\\), the original equation might still hold.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nPerhaps the inequality points where the discriminant is zero, but the original equation might still be satisfied for \\(a = 9, 10, 11\\) through additional conditions. Let's test these values individually.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Testing \\(a = 9, 10, 11\\) Individually**\n\n**Case 1: \\(a = 9\\)**\n\n- **Left Side:**\n  \\[\n  (x - 9)(x - 10) + 1 = x^2 - 19x + 90 + 1 = x^2 - 19x + 91\n  \\]\n  \n- **Right Side:**\n  We need to find \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) such that:\n  \\[\n  (x + b)(x + c) = x^2 - 19x + 91\n  \\]\n  \n- **Equations:**\n  \\[\n  b + c = -19\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  bc = 91\n  \\]\n  \n- **Finding \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):**\n  Solving \n  \\[\n  x^2 + 19x + 91 = 0:\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  \\Delta = 19^2 - 4 \\times 91 = 361 - 364 = -3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  The discriminant is negative, meaning \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are complex numbers. This contradicts the requirement for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) to be real integers. Therefore, \\(a = 9\\) does not satisfy the original equation if \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) must be real.\n\n**Case 2: \\(a = 10\\)**\n\n- **Left Side:**\n  \\[\n  (x - 10)(x - 10) + 1 = x^2 - 20x + 100 + 1 = x^2 - 20x + 101\n  \\]\n  \n- **Right Side:**\n  \\[\n  (x + b)(x + c) = x^2 - 20x + 101\n  \\]\n  \n- **Equations:**\n  \\[\n  b + c = -20\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  bc = 101\n  \\]\n  \n- **Finding \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):**\n  Solving \n  \\[\n  x^2 + 20x + 101 = 0:\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  \\Delta = 20^2 - 4 \\times 101 = 400 - 404 = -4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  Again, the discriminant is negative, indicating complex roots for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). Therefore, \\(a = 10\\) does not satisfy the original equation with real \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n**Case 3: \\(a = 11\\)**\n\n- **Left Side:**\n  \\[\n  (x - 11)(x - 10) + 1 = x^2 - 21x + 110 + 1 = x^2 - 21x + 111\n  \\]\n  \n- **Right Side:**\n  \\[\n  (x + b)(x + c) = x^2 - 21x + 111\n  \\]\n  \n- **Equations:**\n  \\[\n  b + c = -21\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  bc = 111\n  \\]\n  \n- **Finding \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):**\n  Solving \n  \\[\n  x^2 + 21x + 111 = 0:\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  \\Delta = 21^2 - 4 \\times 111 = 441 - 444 = -3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  Once more, the discriminant is negative, leading to complex roots for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). Thus, \\(a = 11\\) does not satisfy the original equation with real \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on this analysis, only \\(a = 8\\) and \\(a = 12\\) satisfy the original equation with real integer values for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). However, the sample solution includes \\(a = 9, 10, 11\\), which suggests that there might be an oversight in the sample solution or an additional interpretation I'm missing.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Re-examining the Sample Solution**\n\n- **Observation:**  \n  The sample solution lists \\(a = 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\). However, our detailed analysis shows that only \\(a = 8\\) and \\(a = 12\\) satisfy the original equation with real integer values for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n- **Possible Explanation:**  \n  It's possible that the sample solution intended to include \\(a = 9, 10, 11\\) by considering complex roots for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), but the original equation implies real \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) since both sides are quadratics with real coefficients.\n\n- **Final Reflection:**  \n  Given that the discriminant is negative for \\(a = 9, 10, 11\\), leading to complex roots, and the original equation involves real polynomials, it's reasonable to conclude that only \\(a = 8\\) and \\(a = 12\\) are valid solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Verifying \\(a = 8\\) and \\(a = 12\\)**\n\n**Verification for \\(a = 8\\):**\n\n- **Left Side:**\n  \\[\n  (x - 8)(x - 10) + 1 = x^2 - 18x + 80 + 1 = x^2 - 18x + 81\n  \\]\n  \n- **Right Side:**\n  \\[\n  (x - 9)(x - 9) = x^2 - 18x + 81\n  \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Both sides are identical, so \\(a = 8\\) is a valid solution.\n\n**Verification for \\(a = 12\\):**\n\n- **Left Side:**\n  \\[\n  (x - 12)(x - 10) + 1 = x^2 - 22x + 120 + 1 = x^2 - 22x + 121\n  \\]\n  \n- **Right Side:**\n  \\[\n  (x - 11)(x - 11) = x^2 - 22x + 121\n  \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Both sides are identical, so \\(a = 12\\) is a valid solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{8, 12}\n\\]  \nOnly \\(a = 8\\) and \\(a = 12\\) satisfy the original equation with real integer values for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Recap and Summary**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:**  \n  Explored expanding both sides, equating coefficients, and considering the quadratic nature of the equation.\n\n- **Coefficient Equations:**  \n  Derived two key equations linking \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n- **Exploring Different Strategies:**  \n  Attempted to solve for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) in terms of \\(a\\) and recognized the need to ensure real solutions by analyzing the discriminant.\n\n- **Discriminant Analysis:**  \n  Determined that the discriminant must be non-negative for real \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), leading to specific conditions on \\(a\\).\n\n- **Solving the Inequality:**  \n  Identified that \\(a\\) must be outside the interval \\([8, 12]\\), but exact equality points \\(a = 8\\) and \\(a = 12\\) also satisfy the equation.\n\n- **Testing Additional Values:**  \n  Tested \\(a = 9, 10, 11\\) and found that they lead to complex roots for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), which are not suitable for the original real quadratic equation.\n\n- **Final Verification:**  \n  Confirmed that only \\(a = 8\\) and \\(a = 12\\) satisfy the original equation with real integer values for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n- **Final Conclusion:**  \n  Only \\(a = 8\\) and \\(a = 12\\) are valid solutions, aligning with the detailed analysis and verification steps.\n\nBy thoroughly exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the results, we've ensured a robust and accurate solution to the problem.",
