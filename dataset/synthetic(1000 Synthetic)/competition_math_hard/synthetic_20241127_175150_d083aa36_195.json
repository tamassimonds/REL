  "problem": "Suppose a function $f(x)$ is defined on the domain $[-8,4]$. If we define a new function $g(x)$ by $$g(x) = f(-2x),$$ then what is the domain of $g(x)$? Express your answer in interval notation.",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's polish this up into a seamless, coherent solution while maintaining the original answer. Here we go:\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. We need to find the domain of the function \n\n\\( g(x) = f(-2x) \\),\n\n given that \n\n\\( f(x) \\)\n\n is defined on the interval \n\n\\([-8, 4]\\)\n\n.\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\n- I need to determine how transforming \n\n\\( f(x) \\)\n\n into \n\n\\( g(x) \\)\n\n affects its domain.\n- This reminds me of problems involving function transformations, specifically horizontal scaling and reflections.\n- But I'm not entirely sure yet how to approach it. Maybe I should brainstorm different strategies.\n\n## **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Substitution Method:**\n   - Substitute \n\n\\( -2x \\)\n\n into \n\n\\( f(x) \\)\n\n and see how it affects \n\n\\( x \\)\n\n.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Transformation:**\n   - Think of \n\n\\( g(x) = f(-2x) \\)\n\n as a combination of reflecting \n\n\\( f(x) \\)\n\n over the y-axis and scaling it horizontally by a factor of 2.\n\n3. **Setting Up Inequalities:**\n   - Set up inequalities based on the original domain to solve for \n\n\\( x \\)\n\n in terms of \n\n\\( g(x) \\)\n\n.\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- The **Direct Substitution Method** seems straightforward, but I'm not sure if it will directly give me the domain.\n- **Analyzing the Transformation** might be helpful to visualize what's happening.\n- **Setting Up Inequalities** sounds more precise, so I'll start there and see if it works.\n\n## **Step 3: Attempting the Inequality Approach**\n\n### **Setting Up the Inequality**\n\nGiven that \n\n\\( f(x) \\)\n\n is defined for \n\n\\( x \\)\n\n in \n\n\\([-8, 4]\\)\n\n, we need \n\n\\( -2x \\)\n\n to lie within this interval for \n\n\\( g(x) \\)\n\n to be defined.\n\nSo, we set up the inequality:\n\n\\[\n-8 \\leq -2x \\leq 4\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- This makes sense because \n\n\\( g(x) = f(-2x) \\)\n\n is only defined where \n\n\\( -2x \\)\n\n falls within the domain of \n\n\\( f(x) \\)\n\n.\n- Now, I need to solve this inequality for \n\n\\( x \\)\n\n.\n\n### **Solving the Inequality**\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Divide All Terms by -2:**\n   - Remember, dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality signs.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-8}{-2} \\geq x \\geq \\frac{4}{-2}\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n4 \\geq x \\geq -2\n\\]\n\n### **Checking the Work:**\n\n- Wait a minute, is this correct? The inequality signs flipped, which seems right because dividing by a negative reverses them.\n- So, the domain of \n\n\\( g(x) \\)\n\n is \n\n\\([-2, 4]\\)\n\n.\n\n## **Step 4: Reflecting on the Solution**\n\n### **Initial Reaction:**\n\n- It looks like the domain of \n\n\\( g(x) \\)\n\n is \n\n\\([-2, 4]\\)\n\n. But I should double-check to ensure this makes sense.\n- Does this interval appropriately reflect the transformations applied?\n\n### **Alternative Strategy Check:**\n\n- Maybe I should apply the **Analyzing the Transformation** strategy to confirm.\n\n#### **Analyzing the Transformation**\n\n- \n\n\\( g(x) = f(-2x) \\)\n\n implies:\n  - **Reflection over the y-axis:** Because of the negative sign in front of \n\n\\( 2x \\)\n\n.\n  - **Horizontal Compression by a Factor of 2:** Because multiplying by 2 speeds up the input.\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- Reflecting and compressing the domain should indeed limit \n\n\\( x \\)\n\n to \n\n\\([-2, 4]\\)\n\n, as only within this range does \n\n\\( -2x \\)\n\n map into \n\n\\([-8, 4]\\)\n\n.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- Both strategies lead to the same domain: \n\n\\([-2, 4]\\)\n\n.\n- This consistency suggests that the solution is correct.\n\n## **Step 5: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n### **Final Check:**\n\n- Let's plug in the endpoints to verify:\n  - For \n\n\\( x = -2 \\)\n\n:\n    \n\\(-2(-2) = 4\\)\n\n, which is within \n\n\\([-8, 4]\\)\n\n.\n  - For \n\n\\( x = 4 \\)\n\n:\n    \n\\(-2(4) = -8\\)\n\n, which is also within \n\n\\([-8, 4]\\)\n\n.\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- Both endpoints map correctly into the domain of \n\n\\( f(x) \\)\n\n.\n- Therefore, the domain of \n\n\\( g(x) \\)\n\n is indeed \n\n\\([-2, 4]\\)\n\n.\n\n<ANSWER>The domain of \n\n\\( g(x) = f(-2x) \\)\n\n is \n\n\\([-2, 4]\\)\n\n.</ANSWER>\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\n- Initially, setting up the inequality seemed like the right approach, and solving it confirmed the domain.\n- Cross-verifying with another strategy (analyzing transformations) helped ensure the correctness.\n- Checking the endpoints provided additional validation that the solution is accurate.\n\nBy carefully exploring different methods and verifying each step, I've confidently determined the domain of \n\n\\( g(x) \\)\n\n.\n\n---\n\nIs there anything else you\u2019d like to explore or any other questions you have?",
  "ground_truth": "We have $g(x) = f(-2x)$, which is defined if and only if $-2x$ is in the domain of $f$, that is, if $$-8 \\le -2x \\le 4.$$ Dividing all expressions in this chain of inequalities by $-2$ compels us to reverse the direction of the inequalities: $$4\\ge x\\ge -2.$$ Thus $g(x)$ is defined if and only if $-2\\le x\\le 4$. In other words, the domain of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{[-2,4]}$."
