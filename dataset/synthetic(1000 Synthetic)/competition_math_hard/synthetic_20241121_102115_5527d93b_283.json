  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's put this solution together in a clear, cohesive manner while maintaining the original answer. We'll streamline the thought process, ensuring each step flows logically into the next, just like how you'd naturally work through it.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe're tasked with determining how many people prefer calling soft drinks \u201cPop\u201d based on a pie chart. The central angle representing \u201cPop\u201d is given as \\(251^\\circ\\), and the total number of people surveyed is 472.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Pie Chart Basics:** Since a pie chart represents parts of a whole circle (\\(360^\\circ\\)), each sector's angle corresponds to its proportion of the total.\n- **Initial Strategy:** Calculate the proportion of the circle that \\(251^\\circ\\) represents and apply that to the total number surveyed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Proportion of the Angle**\n\nFirst, let's determine what fraction \\(251^\\circ\\) is of the entire circle (\\(360^\\circ\\)).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Proportion} = \\frac{251}{360}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- \\(251^\\circ\\) is slightly more than \\(240^\\circ\\) (\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of \\(360^\\circ\\)), so our proportion should be just over \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Proportion Numerically**\n\nNow, let's compute the exact value of this proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{251}{360} \\approx 0.6972\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This means approximately 69.72% of the respondents prefer \u201cPop,\u201d which seems reasonable given the large central angle.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Proportion to the Total Number of People**\n\nNext, we apply this proportion to the total number of people surveyed (472) to find out how many chose \u201cPop\u201d:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of People} = 0.6972 \\times 472 \\approx 329.0688\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- The result is about 329.07. Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we'll round to the nearest whole number.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Rounding to the Nearest Whole Number**\n\nSince \\(329.0688\\) rounds to \\(329\\), we conclude:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Final Answer} = 329\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**  \n- **Proportion Verification:** 69.72% of 472 indeed approximates to 329.\n- **Reasonableness:** Given the large angle representing \u201cPop,\u201d having 329 out of 472 respondents prefer it makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy methodically calculating the proportion of the pie chart's angle and applying it to the total number surveyed, we determine that approximately **329** people prefer calling soft drinks \u201cPop.\u201d Throughout the process, quick checks ensured the calculations were on track, leading to an accurate and reliable answer.\n\n---\n\nThat's how you can naturally work through the problem, ensuring each step is clear and logically connected while maintaining the original answer.",
  "ground_truth": "We want to find the fraction of people that chose ``Pop\". To this end, we find the fraction of the circle that represents ``Pop\", $\\frac{251}{360}$, and multiply by the total number of people surveyed: $472 \\cdot \\frac{251}{360} \\approx 329.089$. Rounding to a whole number gives a possible answer of $329$ people.\n\nThis method doesn't prove that the answer is unique, but we can check that $328$ people would take up only $\\frac{328}{472}\\cdot 360 \\approx 250.169$ degrees of the pie chart, while $330$ people would take up $\\frac{330}{472}\\cdot 360 \\approx 251.695$ degrees. So, $\\boxed{329}$ people are the only number whose share of the pie rounds to the nearest degree as $251^\\circ$."
