  "solution": "Certainly! Let's craft a complete and coherent solution based on the provided working out, ensuring clarity and logical flow while maintaining the final answer as \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen first encountering this problem, it reminds me of geometry questions involving areas of squares and overlapping regions. Seeing a 5x5 grid with points and a shaded square inside a larger square prompts me to determine what fraction of the larger square's area is occupied by the shaded square.\n\nI've tackled similar problems before, where calculating areas and understanding the geometry involved were key. However, I'm not entirely sure where to start, so brainstorming different strategies seems like a good idea.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate Areas Directly:**\n   - Find the area of the larger square.\n   - Find the area of the shaded square.\n   - Compare the two areas to get the fraction.\n\n2. **Use Coordinates:**\n   - Assign coordinates to the grid points.\n   - Determine the vertices of the shaded square.\n   - Use formulas to calculate the area based on coordinates.\n\n3. **Symmetry and Proportions:**\n   - Explore if the shaded square is symmetrically placed.\n   - Use properties of squares and ratios to find the fraction without direct area calculation.\n\n4. **Decompose the Shaded Area:**\n   - Break the shaded square into smaller, manageable shapes (e.g., triangles or rectangles).\n   - Calculate the area of these smaller shapes and sum them up.\n\nI'm leaning towards starting with the **Calculate Areas Directly** method, as it seems straightforward. But I'll keep the other strategies in mind in case I run into issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Calculate Areas Directly**\n\n#### **Step 1: Find the Area of the Larger Square**\n\n- **Thought Process:** The larger square is the boundary of the 5x5 grid. Since it's a square, knowing its side length will allow me to calculate its area.\n\n- **Calculation:** \n  - The grid consists of 5 points per side, creating 4 units between them (since there are 5 points, there are 4 spaces).\n  - Therefore, the side length of the larger square is 4 units.\n  - Area of the larger square = side length \u00d7 side length = \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) square units.\n\n- **Check:** This makes sense because a 5x5 grid of points forms a 4x4 square area.\n\n#### **Step 2: Find the Area of the Shaded Square**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Next, I need to determine the area of the shaded square. Observing the diagram, the shaded square appears rotated or tilted within the larger square. This reminds me of problems where squares are placed at angles, requiring knowledge of side lengths or using the Pythagorean theorem to calculate areas.\n\n- **Initial Idea:** Perhaps I can find the side length of the shaded square or use the coordinates of its vertices to calculate the area.\n\n- **Coordinates Approach:** Assigning coordinates to the grid points might help.\n\n---\n\n### **Assigning Coordinates to Grid Points**\n\n- **Thought Process:** By assigning coordinates, I can precisely locate the vertices of the shaded square and use geometric formulas to find its area.\n\n- **Assignment:** \n  - Let's consider the bottom-left corner of the larger square as the origin \\((0,0)\\).\n  - Each point is 1 unit apart, so the top-right corner is at \\((4,4)\\).\n\n- **Identifying Shaded Square's Vertices:** \n  - From the [asy] code, it appears that the shaded square's vertices are at:\n    - \\((2,2)\\)\n    - \\((3,3)\\)\n    - \\((2,4)\\)\n    - \\((1,3)\\)\n\n- **Check:** These coordinates form a square since all sides are equal, and the angles between them are right angles.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating the Side Length of the Shaded Square**\n\n- **Thought Process:** To find the area of the shaded square, I need to know its side length. I can calculate the distance between two adjacent vertices using the distance formula.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - Let's take the distance between \\((2,2)\\) and \\((3,3)\\):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Side length} = \\sqrt{(3-2)^2 + (3-2)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Since all sides of a square are equal, this side length should apply to all sides of the shaded square.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating the Area of the Shaded Square**\n\n- **Thought Process:** With the side length known, I can calculate the area by squaring the side length.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area of shaded square} = (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \\text{ square units}\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Squaring \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) indeed gives 2, so this calculation seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Determining the Fraction of the Larger Square's Area**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Now that I have both areas, I can find the fraction by dividing the area of the shaded square by the area of the larger square.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\text{Area of shaded square}}{\\text{Area of larger square}} = \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{8}\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Simplifying \\(\\frac{2}{16}\\) to \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) is straightforward, and the fraction makes sense given the relative sizes of the squares.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection: Does This Make Sense?**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Before finalizing the answer, I want to ensure that this approach and the resulting fraction logically fit the problem.\n\n- **Quick Check:** \n  - The shaded square has an area of 2 square units.\n  - The larger square has an area of 16 square units.\n  - Therefore, \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of the larger square's area is occupied by the shaded square.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy Consideration:** \n  - Although initially considering using symmetry or decomposing the shaded area, calculating the areas directly proved effective.\n  - Assigning coordinates helped verify the side length and area, confirming the validity of the approach.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The strategy used is effective, and the calculations align with the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) solution</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Learning from the Process:** Starting with a straightforward strategy to calculate areas directly worked well. Assigning coordinates provided clarity and ensured accuracy in determining the shaded square's area.\n\n- **Flexibility in Approach:** Being open to exploring different strategies and verifying each step helped maintain confidence in the solution. It's essential to reflect and check the reasonableness of the answer throughout the process.\n\n- **Importance of Verification:** Regular checks and reflections ensured that the calculations were correct and that the final answer made sense in the context of the problem.\n\n---\n\n**<ANSWER> \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)</ANSWER>**\n\n**<SUMMARY>**\n\nBy calculating the areas directly and verifying through coordinate assignment, we've determined that the shaded square occupies \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of the larger square's area. This approach ensured accuracy and confirmed the validity of the solution.\n\n---\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if there's anything else you need.",
  "ground_truth": "Since the side of the shaded square is a diagonal of the smaller squares, it has area $(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$ square units. The whole grid has area $4^2 = 16$ units, so the ratio of areas is $\\frac{2}{16} =\\boxed{\\frac 18}$."
