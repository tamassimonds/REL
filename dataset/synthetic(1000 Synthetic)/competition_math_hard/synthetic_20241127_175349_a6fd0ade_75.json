I'll maintain the final answer of \\(a + b + c + d = 17\\) but ensure that the process flows smoothly, reflecting the natural problem-solving journey, including brainstorming, recognizing mistakes, and making necessary corrections.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst, let's unpack what's being asked:\n\n> There are two pairs \\((x, y)\\) of real numbers that satisfy the equation \\(x + y = 3xy = 4\\). Given that the solutions for \\(x\\) are in the form \\(x = \\frac{a \\pm b\\sqrt{c}}{d}\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) are positive integers and the expression is completely simplified, what is the value of \\(a + b + c + d\\)?\n\n**Initial Impression:**\n\nHmm, the notation \\(x + y = 3xy = 4\\) seems ambiguous because equations typically compare two expressions. It likely means there are **two separate equations**:\n\n1. \\(x + y = 4\\)\n2. \\(3xy = 4\\)\n\nI'll **assume** this is the correct interpretation. If that's incorrect, I'll need to adjust my approach later. Let's keep an eye out for that.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nGiven the problem, several methods come to mind:\n\n- **Substitution Method:** Solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other.\n- **Elimination Method:** Combine the equations to eliminate one variable.\n- **Rewriting as a Single Equation:** Try to express everything in terms of one variable.\n- **Using Symmetric Properties:** Since the equations involve sums and products, symmetric functions might be useful.\n\nConsidering that the solutions involve square roots, it hints at a **quadratic equation** being involved. Thus, rewriting the system into a single quadratic equation seems promising.\n\n**Decision:** Let's start with the **Substitution Method**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Using the Substitution Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI'll begin by solving the first equation for \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx + y = 4 \\implies y = 4 - x\n\\]\n\n**Next Step:** Substitute this expression for \\(y\\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\n3x(4 - x) = 4\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n12x - 3x^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nTo form a quadratic equation, let's rearrange:\n\n\\[\n-3x^2 + 12x - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Does this make sense?\n\nYes, substituting \\(y = 4 - x\\) into \\(3xy = 4\\) and simplifying leads us to a quadratic equation. This aligns with the hint that the solution involves square roots. **So far, so good.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, let's solve the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\n-3x^2 + 12x - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\nI'll use the **Quadratic Formula**:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(a = -3\\)\n- \\(b = 12\\)\n- \\(c = -4\\)\n\n**Calculating the Discriminant:**\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = 12^2 - 4(-3)(-4) = 144 - 48 = 96\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Is the discriminant correct?\n\nYes, \\(144 - 48 = 96\\). **This looks right.**\n\n**Plugging into the Quadratic Formula:**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{96}}}{-6}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\nFirst, simplify \\(\\sqrt{96}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{96} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 6} = 4\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-12 \\pm 4\\sqrt{6}}}{-6}\n\\]\n\n**Identifying the Mistake:** \n\nWait a minute, it seems like I can simplify the numerator and denominator further by dividing both by \\(-2\\). Let's do that.\n\n**Correcting the Simplification:**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-12 \\pm 4\\sqrt{6}}}{-6} = \\frac{{12 \\mp 4\\sqrt{6}}}{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's **factor out** a 2 from the numerator:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{2(6 \\mp 2\\sqrt{6})}}{6} = \\frac{{6 \\mp 2\\sqrt{6}}}{3}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, I can simplify this even more by factoring out another 2:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{2(3 \\mp \\sqrt{6})}}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Final Correct Simplification:**\n\nLet\u2019s express it in the required form:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6}}}{3}\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx = 2 \\pm \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Does this match the required form?\n\nYes, it does! Now, let's proceed to express it exactly as the problem requires.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Expressing in the Required Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to express \\(x\\) in the form:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{a \\pm b\\sqrt{c}}{d}\n\\]\n\nFrom the simplification, I have:\n\n\\[\nx = 2 \\pm \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo fit the required form, let's rewrite it as:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6}}{3}\n\\]\n\nWhich can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{2(3 \\pm \\sqrt{6})}}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Final Expression:**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{2(3 \\pm \\sqrt{6})}}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Does this align with the required form?\n\nAbsolutely! It matches \\(x = \\frac{a \\pm b\\sqrt{c}}{d}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's compare our final expression with the required form to identify the constants:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{2(3 \\pm \\sqrt{6})}}{3} = \\frac{{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6}}}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, in the form \\(x = \\frac{a \\pm b\\sqrt{c}}{d}\\), we have:\n\n- \\(a = 6\\)\n- \\(b = 2\\)\n- \\(c = 6\\)\n- \\(d = 3\\)\n\n**Calculating \\(a + b + c + d\\):**\n\n\\[\na + b + c + d = 6 + 2 + 6 + 3 = 17\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Is this correct?\n\nYes, the values align perfectly with the simplified expression. **Everything checks out.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(<ANSWER> 17 </ANSWER>\\)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy carefully revisiting and correcting my simplification steps, I arrived at the correct solution:\n\n\\[\na + b + c + d = 17\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nInitially, I made an error in simplifying the quadratic formula's result. By taking a step back and re-examining my work, I recognized the mistake and corrected it, leading me to the correct answer. It's important to remain vigilant and open to adjusting your approach when something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Solution**\n\n1. **Identified the System of Equations:**\n\n   - \\(x + y = 4\\)\n   - \\(3xy = 4\\)\n\n2. **Applied Substitution:**\n\n   - Solved for \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\): \\(y = 4 - x\\)\n   - Substituted into the second equation to form a quadratic: \\(-3x^2 + 12x - 4 = 0\\)\n\n3. **Solved the Quadratic Equation:**\n\n   - Used the quadratic formula to find \\(x\\): \n   \n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{96}}}{-6} = \\frac{{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6}}}{3}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Expressed in the Required Form:**\n\n   - Simplified the expression to match \\(x = \\frac{a \\pm b\\sqrt{c}}{d}\\)\n\n5. **Identified Constants and Calculated the Sum:**\n\n   - \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 2\\), \\(c = 6\\), \\(d = 3\\)\n   - \\(a + b + c + d = 17\\)\n\nBy reflecting on and correcting my initial approach, I successfully resolved the problem and arrived at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nAlways double-check each step, especially when simplifying expressions. Mistakes can often be caught early by verifying whether the intermediate results align with the expected form. Remaining flexible and open to revisiting previous steps ensures a robust problem-solving process.",
  "ground_truth": "We begin by considering the equation $x + y = 4$. From this, we know that $y = 4-x$. We can then substitute this into the equation $3xy = 4$ to get $3x(4-x) = 12x - 3x^2 = 4$. This then becomes $3x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, we find  \\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nx &= \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144-48}}{6} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nx &= \\frac{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6}}{3}.\n\\end{align*}Thus, $a + b + c + d = 6 + 2 + 6 + 3 = \\boxed{17}$."
