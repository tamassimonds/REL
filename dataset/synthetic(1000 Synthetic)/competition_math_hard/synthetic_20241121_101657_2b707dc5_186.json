  "problem": "There are 3 math teams in the area, with 5, 7, and 8 students respectively. Each team has two co-captains. If I randomly select a team, and then randomly select two members of that team to give a copy of $\\emph{Introduction to Geometry}$, what is the probability that both of the people who receive books are co-captains?",
  "solution": "Absolutely! Let\u2019s put this all together into a coherent and complete solution, maintaining the original thought process while ensuring clarity and correctness. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen faced with this probability problem, my initial reaction is to consider different strategies involving random selection within teams. I recall methods for calculating probabilities based on specific roles, like co-captains, but I'm not entirely sure how to factor in selecting the team first. It\u2019s clear that I need to explore various approaches to find the best fit.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate Probability for Each Team Separately:**  \n   Compute the probability of selecting both co-captains for each team, then average these probabilities based on the likelihood of selecting each team.\n\n2. **Use Total Probability Theorem:**  \n   Consider the probability of selecting co-captains as a weighted sum, where each team's probability contributes based on its selection likelihood.\n\n3. **Simplistic Approach:**  \n   Assume equal probability across all teams and focus solely on the selection within each team.\n\nInitially, the first strategy seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that the probability of selecting each team is handled correctly. Let\u2019s proceed with this approach and adjust if needed.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Calculate Probability for Each Team Separately**\n\n#### **Step 1: Probability of Selecting Each Team**\n\nSince there are three teams, each has an equal chance of being selected:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{selecting a team}) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI briefly consider whether the team size affects this probability, but since the selection is random among the teams, each has an equal likelihood. This confirms that the probability is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) for each team.\n\n#### **Step 2: Probability of Selecting Co-Captains Within a Team**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll calculate the probability of selecting both co-captains for each team.\n\n**Team 1: 5 Students, 2 Co-Captains**\n\n- Total ways to select 2 members:  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{5}{2} = 10\n  \\]\n  \n- Ways to select 2 co-captains:  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{2}{2} = 1\n  \\]\n  \n- Probability:  \n  \\[\n  P(\\text{both co-captains} \\mid \\text{Team 1}) = \\frac{1}{10}\n  \\]\n\n**Team 2: 7 Students, 2 Co-Captains**\n\n- Total ways to select 2 members:  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{7}{2} = 21\n  \\]\n  \n- Ways to select 2 co-captains:  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{2}{2} = 1\n  \\]\n  \n- Probability:  \n  \\[\n  P(\\text{both co-captains} \\mid \\text{Team 2}) = \\frac{1}{21}\n  \\]\n\n**Team 3: 8 Students, 2 Co-Captains**\n\n- Total ways to select 2 members:  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{8}{2} = 28\n  \\]\n  \n- Ways to select 2 co-captains:  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{2}{2} = 1\n  \\]\n  \n- Probability:  \n  \\[\n  P(\\text{both co-captains} \\mid \\text{Team 3}) = \\frac{1}{28}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nCalculating these probabilities individually makes sense, but I need to ensure they are combined correctly based on the probability of selecting each team. Averaging them directly might not be sufficient unless weighted appropriately.\n\n### **Step 3: Combining Probabilities Using Total Probability**\n\nTo find the overall probability of selecting both co-captains, I\u2019ll sum the probabilities for each team, weighted by the probability of selecting that team:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both co-captains}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{21} + \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{28}\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s calculate this step by step:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both co-captains}) = \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{63} + \\frac{1}{84}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAdding fractions with different denominators can be tricky, so I need a common denominator to ensure accuracy. This requires finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.\n\n#### **Finding the Common Denominator**\n\n- **Factors:**\n  - 30 = \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5\\)\n  - 63 = \\(3^2 \\times 7\\)\n  - 84 = \\(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\)\n\n- **LCM:**  \n  \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 1260\\)\n\n#### **Converting Fractions to a Common Denominator**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll convert each fraction to have a denominator of 1260:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{42}{1260}, \\quad \\frac{1}{63} = \\frac{20}{1260}, \\quad \\frac{1}{84} = \\frac{15}{1260}\n\\]\n\n#### **Adding the Fractions**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both co-captains}) = \\frac{42}{1260} + \\frac{20}{1260} + \\frac{15}{1260} = \\frac{77}{1260}\n\\]\n\n#### **Simplifying the Fraction**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{77}{1260} = \\frac{11}{180} \\quad \\text{(by dividing both numerator and denominator by 7)}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Probability**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{both co-captains}) = \\frac{11}{180}\n\\]\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution: \\(\\frac{11}{180}\\) </ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Verification**\n\n- **Does the Probability Make Sense?**  \n  The probability is quite small, which aligns with expectations since selecting both co-captains randomly is a rare event, especially in larger teams.\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Each team's probability is less than \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\). Averaging these with equal weights yields a small overall probability, consistent with the final result of \\(\\frac{11}{180}\\).\n\n- **Alternative Approach Consideration:**  \n  Initially, I thought about using a weighted average based on team sizes, but since each team is equally likely to be selected, the simple average suffices. This confirms the correctness of the chosen strategy.\n\n- **Common Sense Check:**  \n  Larger teams have a lower probability of selecting both co-captains, reflected in the calculations. Team 3, with 8 members, has the lowest probability \\(\\frac{1}{28}\\), while Team 1, with 5 members, has a higher probability \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\). The overall probability appropriately accounts for these variations.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy carefully calculating the probability for each team and correctly averaging them based on equal likelihood of team selection, I arrived at the correct probability. Reflecting at each step ensured that the approach was valid and helped catch any potential errors early on. This detailed, reflective process not only provides the correct answer but also deepens the understanding of probability concepts involved.\n\n---\n\nI hope this refined solution offers clarity and effectively communicates the problem-solving journey!",
  "ground_truth": "There's a $\\dfrac{1}{3}$ chance that I will select each team. Once I have selected a team, let $n$ be the number of students on that team. There are $\\dbinom{n}{2}$ ways to choose a pair of those students to give books to, but only one of those pairs will be the two co-captains, which means that once I have selected that team, the probability that I give books to the co-captains is $$\\dfrac{1}{\\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}}=\\dfrac{2}{n(n-1)}.$$Since the teams have $5,$ $7,$ and $8$ students, this means that the total probability is $$\\dfrac{1}{3}\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5(5-1)}+\\dfrac{2}{7(7-1)}+\\dfrac{2}{8(8-1)}\\right)$$which after a bit of arithmetic simplifies to $\\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{180}}$."
