  "solution": "Alright, let's walk through this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and verify the correctness as I go along. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWe have a system of equations involving floor and fractional parts:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{y\\} &= 2.4, \\\\\n\\{x\\} + \\lfloor y \\rfloor &= 5.1.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Hmm, this involves both the floor \\(\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor\\) and fractional \\(\\{\\cdot\\}\\) parts of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). I remember dealing with these before\u2014floor being the greatest integer less than or equal to a number, and fractional part being the non-integer part.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  - **Strategy 1:** Express \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in terms of their integer and fractional parts.\n  - **Strategy 2:** Assign variables to these parts to simplify the equations.\n  - **Strategy 3:** Utilize constraints since fractional parts are always between 0 and 1.\n\n- **Starting Point:** Assigning variables to the integer and fractional parts seems promising. Let\u2019s give it a try.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Assign Variables to Integer and Fractional Parts**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Assigning Variables:**\n  - Let\u2019s set:\n    - \\(x = a + p\\) where \\(a = \\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) and \\(p = \\{x\\}\\)\n    - \\(y = b + q\\) where \\(b = \\lfloor y \\rfloor\\) and \\(q = \\{y\\}\\)\n\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Since \\(p = \\{x\\}\\) and \\(q = \\{y\\}\\), both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) must be in the range \\([0, 1)\\).\n\n**Reflection:** This approach breaks down \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into their components, aligning well with the given equations. It feels like a solid starting point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Rewriting the Original Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Substituting Variables:**\n  - First equation: \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{y\\} = a + q = 2.4\\)\n  - Second equation: \\(\\{x\\} + \\lfloor y \\rfloor = p + b = 5.1\\)\n\n- **Writing it Out:**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  a + q &= 2.4 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}, \\\\\n  p + b &= 5.1 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}.\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Now, we have two linear equations with four unknowns, but we also have constraints on \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). This seems manageable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Constraints and Possible Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Analyzing Equation 1:**\n  - \\(a + q = 2.4\\)\n  - Since \\(a\\) is an integer and \\(q\\) is between 0 and 1, \\(a\\) must be **2** (because adding any fractional part to 2 can only reach up to 2.4).\n\n- **Calculating \\(q\\):**\n  \\[\n  q = 2.4 - a = 2.4 - 2 = 0.4\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - Does \\(a + q = 2 + 0.4 = 2.4\\)? **Yes**, it works.\n\n- **Analyzing Equation 2:**\n  - \\(p + b = 5.1\\)\n  - Similarly, \\(b\\) must be **5** (since adding any fractional part to 5 can only reach up to 5.1).\n\n- **Calculating \\(p\\):**\n  \\[\n  p = 5.1 - b = 5.1 - 5 = 0.1\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - Does \\(p + b = 0.1 + 5 = 5.1\\)? **Yes**, it works.\n\n**Reflection:** Assigning \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 5\\) with \\(q = 0.4\\) and \\(p = 0.1\\) satisfies both equations. This seems correct so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determining \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Recalling Assignments:**\n  - \\(x = a + p = 2 + 0.1 = 2.1\\)\n  - \\(y = b + q = 5 + 0.4 = 5.4\\)\n\n- **Quick Verification:**\n  - \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2\\) and \\(\\{y\\} = 0.4\\) \u2014> \\(2 + 0.4 = 2.4\\) \u2714\n  - \\(\\{x\\} = 0.1\\) and \\(\\lfloor y \\rfloor = 5\\) \u2014> \\(0.1 + 5 = 5.1\\) \u2714\n\n**Reflection:** Both original equations are satisfied with these values. It looks like we've found the correct \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating \\(|x - y|\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Compute the Difference:**\n  \\[\n  |x - y| = |2.1 - 5.4| = |-3.3| = 3.3\n  \\]\n\n- **Final Check:** Is the absolute difference correct? **Yes**, taking the absolute value of \\(-3.3\\) gives us \\(3.3\\).\n\n**Reflection:** Everything checks out. The calculations are consistent with the given equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>3.3 solution</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Answer:** The absolute difference \\(|x - y|\\) is **3.3**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recap and Verification**\n\n- **Recap Steps:**\n  1. **Assigned Variables:** Broke down \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into their integer and fractional parts.\n  2. **Rewrote Equations:** Simplified the system using these assignments.\n  3. **Applied Constraints:** Determined possible values for the integer and fractional parts based on given sums.\n  4. **Computed \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):** Found exact values satisfying both equations.\n  5. **Calculated \\(|x - y|\\):** Determined the absolute difference.\n\n- **Verification:** Each step was verified through quick checks to ensure that the assigned values satisfied the original equations. The final computation of \\(|x - y|\\) was straightforward and confirmed the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy systematically breaking down the problem and verifying each step, we ensured the correctness of the solution. Initially brainstorming different strategies helped in choosing the most efficient path, and regular checks prevented any missteps along the way.\n\n**Conclusion:** The absolute difference \\(|x - y|\\) is **3.3**.",
  "ground_truth": "Consider the first equation, \\[\\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{y\\} = 2.4.\\]Because $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is an integer, while $0 \\le \\{y\\} < 1,$ the only possibility is that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2$ and $\\{y\\} = 0.4.$ Similarly, from the second equation, we get $\\{x\\} = 0.1$ and $\\lfloor y \\rfloor = 5.$ Then \\[x = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{x\\} = 2.1 \\]and \\[y = \\lfloor y \\rfloor + \\{y\\} = 5.4,\\]so $|x-y| = |2.1-5.4| = \\boxed{3.3}.$"
