  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into this problem, keeping my original ideas but correcting where I went off track. I'll walk through my thought process just like before, noticing where adjustments are needed and integrating new insights naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I think about reflections and symmetry in geometry. Given the pentagon \\(ABCDE\\) formed by reflecting a point \\(A = (u, v)\\), and knowing the area is \\(451\\), my goal is to find \\(u + v\\).\n\nInitially, I'm considering using coordinate geometry to find all the vertices and then applying the shoelace formula to calculate the area. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the most efficient path, so I brainstorm a few strategies:\n\n1. **Coordinate Geometry Approach:**  \n   - Compute coordinates of all vertices through reflections.\n   - Use the shoelace formula to find the area.\n\n2. **Symmetry and Simplification:**  \n   - Leverage symmetry to break the pentagon into simpler shapes like rectangles and triangles.\n\n3. **Vectors and Determinants:**  \n   - Use vectors to handle reflections and area calculations.\n\nThe **Coordinate Geometry Approach** seems straightforward, so I'll start there. But I'll stay open to switching strategies if I hit a snag.\n\n### **Step 1: Reflecting Point A to Find All Vertices**\n\nLet's begin by reflecting point \\(A = (u, v)\\) through the specified lines and axes to find points \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), and \\(E\\).\n\n- **Reflection across \\(y = x\\):**  \n  - **Thought Process:** Swapping coordinates.\n  - \\(B = (v, u)\\)\n\n- **Reflection across the y-axis:**  \n  - **Thought Process:** Changing the sign of the x-coordinate.\n  - \\(C = (-v, u)\\)\n\n- **Reflection across the x-axis:**  \n  - **Thought Process:** Changing the sign of the y-coordinate.\n  - \\(D = (-v, -u)\\)\n\n- **Reflection across the y-axis again:**  \n  - **Thought Process:** Changing the sign of the x-coordinate.\n  - \\(E = (v, -u)\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAlright, so the coordinates are:\n\n- \\(A = (u, v)\\)\n- \\(B = (v, u)\\)\n- \\(C = (-v, u)\\)\n- \\(D = (-v, -u)\\)\n- \\(E = (v, -u)\\)\n\nThis setup suggests symmetry, which might simplify the area calculation. But looking at this again, I wonder if there's a more efficient way to leverage the symmetry instead of calculating each coordinate manually.\n\n### **Step 2: Visualizing the Pentagon**\n\nBefore proceeding, I try to visualize the pentagon. Given the reflections, it seems symmetric across both axes, forming a rectangle and a triangle.\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  - The points \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), and \\(E\\) form a rectangle.\n  - The pentagon is composed of this rectangle plus triangle \\(ABE\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, because reflecting across axes typically creates rectangles and triangles. This insight hints at a possible simplification.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Area Using the Shoelace Formula**\n\nWith the coordinates in hand, I initially plan to use the shoelace formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\sum (x_i y_{i+1} - y_i x_{i+1}) \\right|\n\\]\n\nBut wait\u2014writing out all the terms gets messy, and I realize this might not be the most efficient path. Let me explore an alternative strategy that better leverages the symmetry.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Dividing the Pentagon into Simpler Shapes**\n\nThinking about it again, I can divide the pentagon into a rectangle and a triangle:\n\n- **Rectangle \\(BCDE\\):**  \n  - **Area:** \\(4uv\\) (since its width is \\(2v\\) and height is \\(2u\\))\n\n- **Triangle \\(ABE\\):**  \n  - **Area:** \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2u \\times (u - v) = u^2 - uv\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAdding these areas gives the total area of the pentagon:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Area} = 4uv + (u^2 - uv) = u^2 + 3uv\n\\]\n\nSetting this equal to the given area:\n\n\\[\nu^2 + 3uv = 451\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nWait a minute\u2014this equation looks different from the one I derived earlier using the shoelace formula. Let me double-check my reasoning here. Actually, looking at this again, it makes sense because I'm directly calculating the areas of the rectangle and triangle, which is more straightforward.\n\n### **Step 4: Solving for \\(u\\) and \\(v\\)**\n\nNow, I have:\n\n\\[\nu^2 + 3uv = 451\n\\]\n\nI need to find integer values of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) that satisfy this equation with \\(0 < v < u\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis resembles a Diophantine equation, so factoring might help. Let's see if we can express it as:\n\n\\[\nu(u + 3v) = 451\n\\]\n\nThis implies that \\(u\\) and \\(u + 3v\\) are factors of \\(451\\). Since \\(451 = 11 \\times 41\\), the possible factor pairs are:\n\n\\[\n(u, u + 3v) = (1, 451), (11, 41), (41, 11), (451, 1)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGiven \\(0 < v < u\\), only \\((u, u + 3v) = (11, 41)\\) makes sense because:\n\n\\[\nu = 11,\\quad u + 3v = 41 \\implies 11 + 3v = 41 \\implies 3v = 30 \\implies v = 10\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet's verify:\n\n\\[\nu = 11,\\quad v = 10\n\\]\n\\[\nu^2 + 3uv = 11^2 + 3 \\times 11 \\times 10 = 121 + 330 = 451\n\\]\n\nIt checks out!\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\nTo ensure correctness, let's plug \\(u = 11\\) and \\(v = 10\\) back into the original setup:\n\n- **Coordinates:**\n  - \\(A = (11, 10)\\)\n  - \\(B = (10, 11)\\)\n  - \\(C = (-10, 11)\\)\n  - \\(D = (-10, -11)\\)\n  - \\(E = (10, -11)\\)\n\n- **Area Calculation:**\n  - **Rectangle \\(BCDE\\):**\n    \\[\n    \\text{Area} = 4uv = 4 \\times 11 \\times 10 = 440\n    \\]\n  - **Triangle \\(ABE\\):**\n    \\[\n    \\text{Area} = u^2 - uv = 11^2 - 11 \\times 10 = 121 - 110 = 11\n    \\]\n  - **Total Area:**\n    \\[\n    440 + 11 = 451\n    \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything aligns perfectly! The total area matches the given \\(451\\), confirming that \\(u = 11\\) and \\(v = 10\\) is the correct solution.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy revisiting my initial approach and recognizing the symmetry in the pentagon, I was able to simplify the problem significantly. Instead of relying solely on the shoelace formula, breaking the pentagon into a rectangle and a triangle provided a more straightforward path to the solution.\n\n<ANSWER>  \n<u><strong>Solution:</strong></u>  \nThrough careful reflection and adjustment of strategies, we find that \\(u = 11\\) and \\(v = 10\\). Therefore,  \n\\[\nu + v = 11 + 10 = \\boxed{21}\n\\]  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nThis exercise highlights the importance of flexibility in problem-solving. By being open to changing strategies and thoroughly checking each step, I ensured the correctness of the solution while maintaining an efficient approach.",

If we graph those points, we notice that since the latter four points are all reflected across the x/y-axis, they form a rectangle, and $ABE$ is a triangle. The area of $BCDE$ is $(2u)(2v) = 4uv$ and the area of $ABE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(2u)(u-v) = u^2 - uv$. Adding these together, we get $u^2 + 3uv = u(u+3v) = 451 = 11 \\cdot 41$. Since $u,v$ are positive, $u+3v>u$, and by matching factors we get either $(u,v) = (1,150)$ or $(11,10)$. Since $v < u$ the latter case is the answer, and $u+v = \\boxed{21}$."
