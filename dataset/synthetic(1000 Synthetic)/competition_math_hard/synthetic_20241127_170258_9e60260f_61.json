  "solution": "Alright, let's put everything together into a seamless, coherent solution. I'll maintain the original thought process, ensuring it flows naturally while preserving the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's take a closer look at what we're dealing with:\n\n- We have an equation involving two pairs \\((x, y)\\) of real numbers: \n  \\[\n  x + y = 3xy = 4\n  \\]\n- Our goal is to find the solutions for \\(x\\) in the form \n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{a \\pm b\\sqrt{c}}{d}\n  \\]\n  where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) are positive integers.\n- Finally, we need to determine \n  \\[\n  a + b + c + d\n  \\]\n\n### **Initial Brainstorming and Clarification**\n\nHmm, at first glance, this looks like a system of equations problem. But wait\u2014the way it's written, \\(x + y = 3xy = 4\\), seems a bit confusing. Does it mean \\(x + y = 3xy\\) and \\(3xy = 4\\)? Or is it something else?\n\nI need to clarify this before proceeding. Let's assume it means two separate equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases} \nx + y = 4 \\\\\n3xy = 4 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThinking about it, if both \\(x + y\\) and \\(3xy\\) equal 4, it makes sense to treat them as separate equations. This interpretation aligns with the problem's intent, so I feel confident moving forward.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\nNow, how do I solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)? Let's brainstorm some strategies:\n\n1. **Substitution Method:** Solve one equation for one variable and substitute it into the other.\n2. **Elimination Method:** Combine the equations to eliminate one variable.\n3. **Quadratic Equation:** Use the sum and product of roots to form a quadratic equation.\n4. **Graphical Method:** Visualize the equations to find intersections.\n\nHonestly, the **Quadratic Equation** approach seems most straightforward here since we have \\(x + y\\) and \\(xy\\). But let's explore it step by step to ensure it's the right path.\n\n### **Attempting the Quadratic Equation Approach**\n\nOkay, let's proceed with the **Quadratic Equation** method.\n\n- Recall that for any quadratic equation:\n  \\[\n  t^2 - (\\text{sum})t + (\\text{product}) = 0\n  \\]\n  the roots are the values of the variables.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\nx + y = 4 \\quad \\text{(sum of roots)}\n\\]\n\\[\nxy = \\frac{4}{3} \\quad \\text{(since } 3xy = 4\\text{)}\n\\]\n\n### **Forming the Quadratic Equation**\n\nSo, the quadratic equation would be:\n\n\\[\nt^2 - 4t + \\frac{4}{3} = 0\n\\]\n\nBut wait, I just realized we need to find \\(x\\) in the form \\(\\frac{a \\pm b\\sqrt{c}}{d}\\) with integers. Having a fraction in the equation might complicate things. Maybe we should clear the fraction first.\n\n### **Clearing the Fraction**\n\nLet's multiply the entire equation by 3 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n3t^2 - 12t + 4 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nYeah, this looks better. Now we have integer coefficients, which should simplify finding the exact form of the roots.\n\n### **Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\nNow, let's use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = -12\\), and \\(c = 4\\).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{-(-12) \\pm \\sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4}}{2 \\cdot 3}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying step by step:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 48}}{6}\n\\]\n\\[\nt = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{96}}{6}\n\\]\n\nAlright, we have \\(\\sqrt{96}\\). Let's simplify that:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{96} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 6} = 4\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{12 \\pm 4\\sqrt{6}}{6}\n\\]\n\n### **Simplifying the Expression**\n\nLet's simplify this expression:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{12}{6} \\pm \\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{6} = 2 \\pm \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute... Looking at the expected form \n\\[\nx = \\frac{a \\pm b\\sqrt{c}}{d}\n\\]\nit seems like we can combine the terms to fit that format better.\n\n### **Rewriting in the Desired Form**\n\nLet's combine the terms:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6}}{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's verify if this matches the required form:\n\n- \\(a = 6\\)\n- \\(b = 2\\)\n- \\(c = 6\\)\n- \\(d = 3\\)\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[\na + b + c + d = 6 + 2 + 6 + 3 = 17\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, let me double-check the simplification to make sure everything is correct.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{12 \\pm 4\\sqrt{6}}{6}\n\\]\n\nDividing both numerator terms by 6:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{12}{6} \\pm \\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{6} = 2 \\pm \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3}\n\\]\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6}}{3}\n\\]\n\nYeah, that looks correct.\n\n### **Checking the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's do a quick check to ensure the solution satisfies the original equations.\n\n- Let's take one of the solutions:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{6 + 2\\sqrt{6}}{3} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = \\frac{6 - 2\\sqrt{6}}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Calculate \\(x + y\\):**\n\n\\[\nx + y = \\frac{6 + 2\\sqrt{6}}{3} + \\frac{6 - 2\\sqrt{6}}{3} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n\\]\n\nOkay, that satisfies \\(x + y = 4\\).\n\n**Now, calculate \\(xy\\):**\n\n\\[\nxy = \\left(\\frac{6 + 2\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{6 - 2\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right) = \\frac{(6)^2 - (2\\sqrt{6})^2}{9} = \\frac{36 - 24}{9} = \\frac{12}{9} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n\\[\n3xy = 4\n\\]\n\nPerfect! Both equations are satisfied.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER> solution YES  \n\\[\na + b + c + d = 6 + 2 + 6 + 3 = 17\n\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Understanding the Problem:** Identified it as a system of equations with a specific solution form.\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:** Considered substitution, elimination, and quadratic equation methods; chose the quadratic equation approach.\n- **Solving Step-by-Step:** Formed the quadratic equation, cleared fractions, applied the quadratic formula, and simplified the solution.\n- **Checking the Solution:** Verified that the solutions satisfy the original equations.\n- **Final Answer:** Confirmed \n\\[\na + b + c + d = 17\n\\]\n\nThroughout the process, I regularly reflected and checked each step to ensure correctness, adjusting the approach as needed.\n\n---\n\nI hope this organized approach helps in understanding the solution more effectively!",
  "ground_truth": "We begin by considering the equation $x + y = 4$. From this, we know that $y = 4-x$. We can then substitute this into the equation $3xy = 4$ to get $3x(4-x) = 12x - 3x^2 = 4$. This then becomes $3x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, we find  \\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nx &= \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144-48}}{6} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nx &= \\frac{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6}}{3}.\n\\end{align*}Thus, $a + b + c + d = 6 + 2 + 6 + 3 = \\boxed{17}$."
