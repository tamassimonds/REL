    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like we would if we were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and make adjustments as needed to ensure we're on the right path.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nOkay, we have a sector \\( OAB \\) which is a quarter of a circle with a radius of 3 cm. Inside this sector, there's a circle that's tangent at three points: presumably to both radii \\( OA \\) and \\( OB \\), as well as the arc \\( AB \\). We need to find the radius of this inscribed circle.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **Isosceles Right Triangle Approach:** Since it's a quarter circle, the angle \\( AOB \\) is \\( 90^\\circ \\). The sector resembles an isosceles right triangle with the arc replacing the hypotenuse. Maybe we can use properties of such triangles?\n- **Coordinate Geometry:** Placing the sector on a coordinate plane might help visualize and set up equations.\n- **Trigonometry:** Perhaps using sine and cosine for the angles involved could yield relationships between the radii.\n- **Pythagorean Theorem:** Given the right angles, Pythagorean relationships might come in handy.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe circle is tangent to both the radii and the arc, which suggests that its center lies along the angle bisector of \\( AOB \\). This might simplify things because the angle bisector divides the \\( 90^\\circ \\) angle into two \\( 45^\\circ \\) angles.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Drawing and Placing Coordinates**\n\n**Approach:**  \nLet's place the sector in a coordinate system to make it easier to visualize and calculate.\n\n**Setup:**\n- Let the origin \\( O \\) be at \\( (0, 0) \\).\n- Point \\( A \\) at \\( (3, 0) \\).\n- Point \\( B \\) at \\( (0, 3) \\).\n- The arc \\( AB \\) is the quarter-circle from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n\n**Coordinate Placement:**  \nThis makes the angle \\( AOB \\) a right angle at the origin.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBy placing the sector in this way, we can easily apply geometric and algebraic methods. The inscribed circle's center will likely be at an equal distance from both axes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Center of the Inscribed Circle**\n\n**Approach:**  \nSince the circle is tangent to both \\( OA \\) and \\( OB \\), its center lies along the angle bisector of \\( AOB \\), which is the line \\( y = x \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- The center of the circle, let's call it \\( C \\), will have coordinates \\( (h, h) \\).\n- The distance from \\( C \\) to both \\( OA \\) and \\( OB \\) will be \\( h \\).\n- The circle is also tangent to the arc \\( AB \\), which adds another condition.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis setup makes sense because the circle being tangent to both axes means its center is equidistant from them. Now, we need to find the relationship between \\( h \\) and the radius of the inscribed circle, \\( r \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Establishing Relationships**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe radius of the inscribed circle \\( r \\) is the distance from the center \\( C \\) to any of the tangent points on \\( OA \\) or \\( OB \\). Thus, \\( h = r \\).\n\n**Equation Setup:**\n- Since the circle is tangent to the arc \\( AB \\) as well, the distance from \\( C \\) to the arc should be \\( r \\).\n- The arc is part of the circle centered at \\( O \\) with radius 3 cm.\n\n**Brainstorm:**  \nThe distance from \\( C \\) to \\( O \\) must then be \\( 3 - r \\), because the inscribed circle's radius plus its distance from \\( O \\) equals the radius of the larger circle.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems logical. If \\( C \\) is \\( r \\) units away from the arc, then the rest of the distance to \\( O \\) must account for the total radius of the larger circle.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\n**Approach:**  \nSince \\( C \\) lies on \\( y = x \\) at \\( (r, r) \\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate \\( r \\) and the distance from \\( C \\) to \\( O \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Distance from } C \\text{ to } O = \\sqrt{r^2 + r^2} = \\sqrt{2}r \n\\]\n\\[ \n\\text{But, } \\sqrt{2}r = 3 - r \n\\]\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\\[ \n\\sqrt{2}r + r = 3 \n\\]\n\\[ \nr (\\sqrt{2} + 1) = 3 \n\\]\n\\[ \nr = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2} + 1} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis equation looks correct. Now, let's simplify \\( r \\) to express it in its simplest radical form.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Simplifying the Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWe need to rationalize the denominator to express \\( r \\) in a cleaner form.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[ \nr = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2} + 1} \n\\]\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \\( \\sqrt{2} - 1 \\):\n\\[ \nr = \\frac{3(\\sqrt{2} - 1)}{(\\sqrt{2} + 1)(\\sqrt{2} - 1)} \n\\]\n\\[ \nr = \\frac{3(\\sqrt{2} - 1)}{2 - 1} \n\\]\n\\[ \nr = 3(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis simplifies beautifully! The radius of the inscribed circle is \\( r = 3(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \\) cm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Check:**  \n- **Distance from \\( C \\) to \\( O \\):**  \n  Using \\( r = 3(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \\):\n  \\[ \n  \\sqrt{2}r = \\sqrt{2} \\times 3(\\sqrt{2} - 1) = 3(2 - \\sqrt{2}) = 6 - 3\\sqrt{2} \n  \\]\n  \\[ \n  6 - 3\\sqrt{2} + 3(\\sqrt{2} - 1) = 3 \n  \\]\n  This confirms our earlier equation.\n\n- **Tangent Conditions:**  \n  The circle is tangent to both \\( OA \\) and \\( OB \\) at a distance \\( r \\) from them, and also tangent to the arc \\( AB \\) at a distance \\( r \\) from \\( C \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll conditions are satisfied, which validates our solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the problem, exploring different strategies, and verifying each step, we've determined that the radius of the inscribed circle is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \\text{ cm}}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach ensures that we've thoroughly understood and correctly solved the problem, considering multiple perspectives and confirming the accuracy of our solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Call the center of the inscribed circle $C$, and let $D$ be the point shared by arc $AB$ and the inscribed circle.  Let $E$ and $F$ be the points where the inscribed circle is tangent to $OA$ and $OB$ respectively.  Since angles $CEO$, $CFO$, and $EOF$ are all right angles, angle $FCE$ is a right angle as well.  Therefore, the measure of angle $DCE$ is $(360-90)/2=135$ degrees.  By symmetry, angles $ECO$ and $FCO$ are congruent, so each measures 45 degrees.  Therefore, angle $DCO$ measures $135+45=180$ degrees, which implies $DC+CO=OD$.  Also, $DC=r$, and $CO=r\\sqrt{2}$, since triangle $CEO$ is an isosceles right triangle. Since $OD$ is a radius of the circle centered at $O$, we may set $DC+CO=r+r\\sqrt{2}$ equal to 3 cm to find \\[\nr=\\frac{3\\text{ cm}}{\\sqrt{2}+1}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{\\sqrt{2}-1}=\\boxed{3\\sqrt{2}-3}\\text{ centimeters}.\n\\]\n\n[asy]\nimport olympiad; import geometry; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\ndraw(Arc(origin,3,90,180));\ndraw((-3,0)--(origin)--(0,3));\nreal x = 3/(1 + sqrt(2));\ndraw(Circle((-x,x),x)); label(\"$B$\",(0,3),N); label(\"$A$\",(-3,0),W);\nlabel(\"$O$\",(0,0),SE); draw((0,0)--(-3,0));\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-x,x),NE); label(\"$D$\",(-3/sqrt(2),3/sqrt(2)),NW);\nlabel(\"$F$\",(0,x),E); label(\"$E$\",(-x,0),S);\ndraw((-x,0)--(-x,x)--(0,x));\ndraw((-x,x)--(-3/sqrt(2),3/sqrt(2)));\ndraw((-x,x)--origin,linetype(\"1 2\"));[/asy]"
