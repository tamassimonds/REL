  "problem": "For how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 120 inclusive does the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{120}$ terminate?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their effectiveness, and adjust my approach as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, the question asks for how many integer values of \\( n \\) between 1 and 120 make the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\) terminate. \n\nWait a minute, this reminds me of problems involving terminating decimals and prime factorization. I think I've seen something like this before... but let me brainstorm a bit to make sure.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Prime Factorization:** I've heard that fractions have terminating decimals if their denominators have only certain prime factors.\n- **Checking Each \\( n \\):** Maybe I could test each \\( n \\) from 1 to 120, but that seems time-consuming.\n- **Finding Patterns:** Perhaps there's a pattern or formula I can use to simplify the process.\n\nOkay, I\u2019ll start by exploring the prime factorization strategy since it seems the most straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Prime Factorization Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf I recall correctly, a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) has a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \\( b \\), after simplification, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\nHmm, so I need to ensure that in \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\), the denominator after reducing is composed only of the primes 2 and 5. Let's see how that works.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because 10 (which is 2 \\times 5) is the base of our decimal system, so any fraction whose denominator is a power of 2 and/or 5 should terminate.\n\n---\n\n### **Breaking Down the Denominator \\( 120 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's factorize 120 to see its prime components.\n\n\\[\n120 = 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\n\\]\n\nOkay, so 120 has prime factors of 2, 3, and 5. I remember that for the decimal to terminate, the denominator must not have any prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, does that mean I need to eliminate the 3 from the denominator? Yes, exactly! So, I need to find those \\( n \\) values where, after reducing \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\), no factors of 3 remain in the denominator.\n\n---\n\n### **Formulating the Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure that the denominator after simplification only contains 2s and 5s, \\( n \\) must cancel out all the 3s in 120.\n\nSo, \\( n \\) must be a multiple of 3. This way, the factor of 3 in the denominator is canceled out, leaving only 2s and 5s.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIs this the right approach? Let me think... Yes, because if \\( n \\) is a multiple of 3, then \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\) simplifies to a fraction whose denominator only has 2s and 5s, ensuring a terminating decimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementing the Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to count all the multiples of 3 between 1 and 120. This will give me all the \\( n \\) values that make \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\) have a terminating decimal.\n\nHow do I find the multiples of 3 within a range? I can divide the upper limit by 3 and count the integers.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of multiples of 3} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{120}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 40\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this calculation make sense? Yes, because 3 times 40 equals 120, so there are exactly 40 multiples of 3 within the range.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAlright, so there are 40 integer values of \\( n \\) between 1 and 120 for which \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\) has a terminating decimal.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nLet me quickly verify by considering the extremes:\n- For \\( n = 3 \\), \\(\\frac{3}{120} = \\frac{1}{40}\\), which has a terminating decimal (0.025).\n- For \\( n = 120 \\), \\(\\frac{120}{120} = 1\\), which definitely terminates.\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>40</ANSWER>**\n\nThere are **40** integer values of \\( n \\) between 1 and 120 inclusive for which the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{n}{120}\\) terminates.\n\n---\n\nI hope this walkthrough helps! By brainstorming different strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying the final answer, I ensured a comprehensive and accurate solution.

  "ground_truth": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $3$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{120-1}{3} \\right\\rfloor+1=40$ multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $120$, so there are $\\boxed{40}$ integers values for $n$."
