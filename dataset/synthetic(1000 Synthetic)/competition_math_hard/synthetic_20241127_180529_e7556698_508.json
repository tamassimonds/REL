  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem the way a human brain naturally would\u2014thinking out loud, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness, and adjusting our approach as needed. Here's how I'd approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we're asked to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\(2^{1998} - 1\\) and \\(2^{1989} - 1\\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nHmm... this looks like a number theory problem involving exponents. I vaguely remember that the GCD of numbers in the form \\(2^n - 1\\) can be tackled using properties of divisors and possibly the Euclidean algorithm. But to be honest, I'm not entirely sure which method will work best right off the bat.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Euclidean Algorithm:**  \n   I've used this before for finding GCDs. Maybe applying it here could work.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:**  \n   Breaking down the numbers into their prime factors might help, but factoring such large exponents seems impractical.\n\n3. **Using Mathematical Theorems:**  \n   Perhaps leveraging the properties of exponents and divisors, like using Lemmas or the GCD of powers, could be useful.\n\n4. **Exploring Patterns:**  \n   Looking for patterns in smaller exponents to see if there's a general rule.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGiven the size of the exponents, prime factorization seems too cumbersome. Exploring patterns might help, but I think starting with the Euclidean algorithm could be a straightforward approach. If that doesn't work, I'll consider other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Euclidean Algorithm**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s try using the Euclidean algorithm, which states that \\(\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b)\\). Applying it to our numbers might simplify the problem.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nSet \\(a = 2^{1998} - 1\\) and \\(b = 2^{1989} - 1\\).\n\nCompute \\(a \\mod b\\):\n\n\\[\na \\mod b = (2^{1998} - 1) \\mod (2^{1989} - 1)\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Moment...**  \nThis looks a bit tricky to compute directly. Maybe I need to rethink how to simplify this expression. Direct computation isn't feasible with such large exponents.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nInstead of calculating directly, let\u2019s try to express \\(2^{1998}\\) in terms of \\(2^{1989}\\).\n\n**Rewriting \\(2^{1998}\\):**\n\n\\[\n2^{1998} = 2^{1989} \\times 2^9\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n2^{1998} - 1 = (2^{1989} \\times 2^9) - 1\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Back:**\n\n\\[\na \\mod b = [(2^{1989} \\times 2^9) - 1] \\mod (2^{1989} - 1)\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**  \nLet\u2019s see if this can be simplified. Notice that:\n\n\\[\n2^{1989} \\equiv 1 \\mod (2^{1989} - 1)\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n(2^{1989} \\times 2^9) \\equiv 2^9 \\mod (2^{1989} - 1)\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\na \\mod b = 2^9 - 1 = 511\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, let me double-check this to make sure it's correct.  \n\\[\n2^9 = 512, \\quad 512 - 1 = 511\n\\]  \nYes, that seems right.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, so using the Euclidean algorithm, we've reduced the problem to finding \\(\\gcd(2^{1989} - 1, 511)\\). This looks much more manageable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Continuing with the Euclidean Algorithm**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's apply the Euclidean algorithm again to find \\(\\gcd(2^{1989} - 1, 511)\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nSet \\(c = 2^{1989} - 1\\) and \\(d = 511\\).\n\nCompute \\(c \\mod d\\):\n\n\\[\nc \\mod d = (2^{1989} - 1) \\mod 511\n\\]\n\n**Wait, How Do I Compute This?**  \nI realize that calculating \\(2^{1989} \\mod 511\\) directly is still a bit tricky. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nLet's see if we can use properties of exponents to simplify this calculation.\n\n**Exploring Patterns:**\n\nPerhaps looking for patterns in smaller exponents can help. Let's compute \\(2^n \\mod 511\\) for smaller values of \\(n\\) to see if there's a repeating pattern.\n\n**But Wait...**  \nActually, this might take a while and isn't the most efficient way. I need to think of a better strategy.\n\n**New Idea:**  \nMaybe I can use the fact that \\(511 = 2^9 - 1\\), and see if \\(2^{1989} - 1\\) is divisible by \\(511\\).\n\n**Applying Exponent Properties:**\n\nLet's see if \\(2^{1989}\\) can be expressed in terms of \\(2^9\\):\n\n\\[\n2^{1989} = (2^9)^{221} \\times 2^0\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n2^{1989} - 1 = [(2^9)^{221} \\times 1] - 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (511^{221} \\times 1) - 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 511^{221} - 1\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**  \nNotice that \\(511^{221} - 1\\) is divisible by \\(511\\), as it's in the form \\(a^k - 1\\), which is divisible by \\(a - 1\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTherefore, \\(c \\mod d = 0\\), meaning that \\(511\\) divides \\(2^{1989} - 1\\) exactly.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense because \\(511 = 2^9 - 1\\), and \\(2^{1989}\\) is a multiple of \\(2^9\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finalizing the GCD**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince \\(c \\mod d = 0\\), the GCD is \\(d = 511\\).\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me verify this by thinking through the steps again:\n\n- We started with \\(a = 2^{1998} - 1\\) and \\(b = 2^{1989} - 1\\).\n- Using the Euclidean algorithm, we found \\(a \\mod b = 511\\).\n- Then, we determined that \\(511\\) divides \\(b = 2^{1989} - 1\\) exactly.\n- Therefore, the GCD is \\(511\\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. By applying the Euclidean algorithm and leveraging properties of exponents, we've arrived at the correct GCD.\n\n**<ANSWER>511 solution</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:**  \n  Exploring the Euclidean algorithm worked well, even though direct computation seemed challenging at first. Adjusting the approach to express exponents in terms of smaller powers made the problem manageable.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies Considered:**  \n  Prime factorization and pattern exploration were considered but deemed impractical for such large exponents.\n\n- **Key Realization:**  \n  Recognizing that \\(511 = 2^9 - 1\\) and that \\(2^{1989}\\) is a multiple of \\(2^9\\) was crucial in simplifying the problem.\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  Consistently checking each step ensured that the approach was correct and led to the right answer.\n\n---\n\nBy thinking through the problem step-by-step, exploring different strategies, and reflecting on each part of the process, we successfully determined that the greatest common divisor is **511**.",
  "ground_truth": "Let $m = 2^{1998} - 1$ and $n = 2^{1989}-1$. Then, $2^9n = 2^9(2^{1989}-1) = 2^{1998} - 2^9 = m - (2^9 - 1)$. By the Euclidean algorithm, it follows that \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(m,n) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,m-2^9n) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,2^9-1). \\\\\n\\end{align*}Since $9$ divides $1998$, by the difference of odd powers factorization, it follows that $2^{1989}-1$ is divisible by $2^9 - 1$. Thus, the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is $2^9 - 1 = \\boxed{511}$."
