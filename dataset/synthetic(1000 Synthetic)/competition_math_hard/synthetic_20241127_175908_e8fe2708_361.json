  "problem": "If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers for which $ab - 3a + 4b = 137$, what is the minimal possible value of $|a - b|$?",
  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's dive into this problem step by step, embracing the natural thought process, exploring different strategies, and reflecting along the way. \n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\]\n\nwith \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as positive integers, it reminds me of problems involving factoring or rearranging to find integer solutions. The goal is to minimize \\( |a - b| \\), which suggests that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) should be as close as possible.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Maybe I should try brainstorming different strategies to see what fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Factoring the Equation:**  \n   Perhaps I can rewrite the equation to make it easier to find integer solutions. This might involve completing the square or factoring by grouping.\n\n2. **Substitution Method:**  \n   I could express one variable in terms of the other and see if that leads to a solvable equation.\n\n3. **Testing Small Values:**  \n   Maybe starting with small integers for \\( a \\) or \\( b \\) to see if I can spot a pattern or find a solution.\n\n4. **Using Symmetry:**  \n   Since \\( |a - b| \\) is symmetric, perhaps finding solutions where \\( a = b \\) or close to it might help.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the First Strategy: Factoring the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s try factoring the equation to see if it simplifies the problem.\n\n**Attempt:**  \nStarting with the original equation:  \n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\]  \nRearrange it:  \n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b - 137 = 0 \\]  \nTry factoring by grouping:  \n\\[ a(b - 3) + 4b = 137 \\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, that doesn't seem to lead anywhere obvious. I still have a mixed term with \\( b \\). Perhaps factoring like this isn't the most straightforward path.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFactoring by grouping doesn't immediately help. Maybe I need to try a different approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Trying the Second Strategy: Substitution Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s express one variable in terms of the other to simplify the equation.\n\n**Attempt:**  \nSolve for \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\):  \n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\]  \n\\[ ab + 4b = 137 + 3a \\]  \n\\[ b(a + 4) = 137 + 3a \\]  \n\\[ b = \\frac{137 + 3a}{a + 4} \\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nFor \\( b \\) to be an integer, \\( \\frac{137 + 3a}{a + 4} \\) must be an integer. This means \\( a + 4 \\) must divide \\( 137 + 3a \\) evenly.\n\n**Checking:**  \nThis seems promising. I can proceed by ensuring that \\( a + 4 \\) divides \\( 137 + 3a \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with the Substitution Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSet up the divisibility condition to find possible values for \\( a \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \nFrom \\( b = \\frac{137 + 3a}{a + 4} \\),  \nwe need \\( a + 4 \\mid 137 + 3a \\).  \n\nSimplify:  \n\\[ \\frac{137 + 3a}{a + 4} = 3 + \\frac{125}{a + 4} \\]  \n(This is because \\( 3(a + 4) = 3a + 12 \\), and subtracting from \\( 137 + 3a \\) leaves \\( 125 \\).)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, \\( \\frac{125}{a + 4} \\) must be an integer. This means \\( a + 4 \\) must be a divisor of 125.\n\n**Checking:**  \nThis is a concrete condition that we can work with!\n\n---\n\n### **Identifying Possible Values for \\( a \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFind all positive integers \\( a \\) such that \\( a + 4 \\) divides 125.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nThe divisors of 125 are:  \n1, 5, 25, 125  \n\nThus, \\( a + 4 \\) can be any of these. Subtracting 4 from each, we get possible values for \\( a \\):  \n- \\( a = 1 - 4 = -3 \\) (not positive)  \n- \\( a = 5 - 4 = 1 \\)  \n- \\( a = 21 - 4 = 21 \\)  \n- \\( a = 121 - 4 = 121 \\)  \n\nSo, valid positive integers for \\( a \\) are:  \n\\[ a = 1, 21, 121 \\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems correct. We have identified possible values for \\( a \\) that satisfy the divisibility condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating Corresponding \\( b \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFor each valid \\( a \\), compute \\( b \\) using \\( b = \\frac{137 + 3a}{a + 4} \\) and determine \\( |a - b| \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\n1. **For \\( a = 1 \\):**  \n   \\[ b = \\frac{137 + 3(1)}{1 + 4} = \\frac{140}{5} = 28 \\]  \n   \\[ |1 - 28| = 27 \\]  \n\n2. **For \\( a = 21 \\):**  \n   \\[ b = \\frac{137 + 3(21)}{21 + 4} = \\frac{137 + 63}{25} = \\frac{200}{25} = 8 \\]  \n   \\[ |21 - 8| = 13 \\]  \n\n3. **For \\( a = 121 \\):**  \n   \\[ b = \\frac{137 + 3(121)}{121 + 4} = \\frac{137 + 363}{125} = \\frac{500}{125} = 4 \\]  \n   \\[ |121 - 4| = 117 \\]  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe absolute differences are 27, 13, and 117. The minimal \\( |a - b| \\) is 13 when \\( a = 21 \\) and \\( b = 8 \\).\n\n**Checking:**  \nLet's verify that these values satisfy the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEnsure that our solutions satisfy the original equation \\( ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\n1. **For \\( a = 1, b = 28 \\):**  \n   \\[ 1 \\times 28 - 3 \\times 1 + 4 \\times 28 = 28 - 3 + 112 = 137 \\]  \n   **Works!**  \n\n2. **For \\( a = 21, b = 8 \\):**  \n   \\[ 21 \\times 8 - 3 \\times 21 + 4 \\times 8 = 168 - 63 + 32 = 137 \\]  \n   **Works!**  \n\n3. **For \\( a = 121, b = 4 \\):**  \n   \\[ 121 \\times 4 - 3 \\times 121 + 4 \\times 4 = 484 - 363 + 16 = 137 \\]  \n   **Works!**  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll three pairs satisfy the equation, confirming that our solutions are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAfter exploring different strategies and confirming the solutions, the minimal possible value of \\( |a - b| \\) is **13** when \\( a = 21 \\) and \\( b = 8 \\).\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nBy starting with brainstorming and trying multiple strategies, we arrived at a substitution method that led us to the solution. Regularly reflecting and checking each step ensured that we stayed on the right path and verified the correctness of our solutions.\n\n<ANSWER>13</ANSWER>\n\n---",
  "ground_truth": "We apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and note that if we subtract 12 from both sides, then the left side can be factored. Thus, $$ab - 3a + 4b -12 = 125 \\rightarrow (a+4)(b-3) = 125$$Since $a,b$ are positive integers, then $a+4, b-3$ must be a pair of factors of $125= 5^3$, so $(a+4,b-3)$ must be among  $$(1,125), (5,25), (25,5),(125,1).$$Thus, $(a,b)$ must be among  $$(-3,128), (1,28), (21,8), (121,4).$$Ruling out the first solution on account of the negative value for $a$, we find that the minimal value of $|a-b|$ among the remaining three is $|21-8|=\\boxed{13}$."
