  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into this problem and streamline the original approach. I'll maintain the core steps while enhancing clarity and ensuring coherence throughout the solution. Here's how I would tackle it, incorporating various strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the outcome.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nWe're given a rectangle with vertices \\((0,0), (2,0), (2,1), (0,1)\\). A point \\( P \\) is randomly selected within this rectangle. The goal is to determine the probability that \\( P \\) is closer to the origin \\((0,0)\\) than to the point \\((3,1)\\).\n\n- **Initial Thoughts:** This problem involves comparing distances on a plane. It reminds me of using distance formulas and possibly identifying regions where one distance is shorter than the other.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Use the Distance Formula:** Set up an inequality comparing distances to define the desired region.\n  2. **Graphical Approach:** Visualize the rectangle and plot the boundary where the distances are equal.\n  3. **Consider Symmetry:** Check if the rectangle's properties can simplify the calculation.\n\n- **Preference:** Starting with the **Distance Formula** seems straightforward. If complications arise, we can pivot to other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Distance Formula**\n\nLet's compute the distances from any point \\( P(x,y) \\) to both \\((0,0)\\) and \\((3,1)\\).\n\n\\[\nd_1 = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\quad \\text{(to the origin)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nd_2 = \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2} \\quad \\text{(to } (3,1))\n\\]\n\n- **Objective:** We need \\( d_1 < d_2 \\), meaning:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This inequality makes sense as it directly compares the distances. To simplify, let's eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Inequality**\n\nSquare both sides to remove the square roots:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 < (x - 3)^2 + (y - 1)^2\n\\]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 - 2y + 1\n\\]\n\nSimplify by canceling out \\( x^2 \\) and \\( y^2 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0 < -6x - 2y + 10\n\\]\n\nRearrange to form a more intuitive inequality:\n\n\\[\n6x + 2y < 10\n\\]\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 2 to simplify:\n\n\\[\n3x + y < 5\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This linear inequality represents the boundary where points are equidistant from \\((0,0)\\) and \\((3,1)\\). Points satisfying \\( 3x + y < 5 \\) are closer to the origin.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Let's verify if this boundary makes sense by considering specific points:\n  - At \\( (0,0) \\): \\( 3(0) + 0 = 0 < 5 \\) \u2705\n  - At \\( (2,1) \\): \\( 3(2) + 1 = 7 > 5 \\) \u274c\n\nThis confirms that points inside the boundary are indeed closer to the origin.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Visualizing the Boundary**\n\nNow, let's visualize the rectangle and the line \\( 3x + y = 5 \\).\n\n- **Rectangle Vertices:** \\((0,0), (2,0), (2,1), (0,1)\\) \n\n- **Boundary Line:** \\( 3x + y = 5 \\) rearranges to \\( y = -3x + 5 \\)\n\n- **Intercepts:**\n  - **When \\( x = 0 \\):** \\( y = 5 \\) (outside the rectangle)\n  - **When \\( y = 0 \\):** \\( x = \\frac{5}{3} \\approx 1.67 \\) (inside the rectangle)\n\n- **Intersection Points within the Rectangle:**\n  - **Bottom Edge:** \\( (x = \\frac{5}{3}, y = 0) \\)\n  - **Top Edge:** Solve for \\( y = 1 \\):\n  \n    \\[\n    3x + 1 = 5 \\implies 3x = 4 \\implies x = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.33\n    \\]\n    \n    So, the intersection at \\( (x = \\frac{4}{3}, y = 1) \\)\n\n- **Reflection:** The line intersects the rectangle at two points: \\((\\frac{5}{3}, 0)\\) and \\((\\frac{4}{3}, 1)\\). This divides the rectangle into two regions. The area below this line is where points are closer to the origin.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determining the Closer Region**\n\nThe region closer to the origin is a quadrilateral formed by the vertices \\((0,0), (\\frac{5}{3}, 0), (\\frac{4}{3}, 1), (0,1))\\).\n\n- **Visual Check:** Drawing these points confirms that the quadrilateral lies within the rectangle, representing the area where \\( P \\) is closer to \\((0,0)\\).\n\n- **Reflection:** It\u2019s essential to ensure all vertices are correctly identified to avoid miscalculations in the area.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Area of the Quadrilateral**\n\nTo find the probability, we need the area of this quadrilateral relative to the total area of the rectangle.\n\n**Approach:** Split the quadrilateral into a rectangle and a right triangle for easier calculation.\n\n1. **Rectangle:** From \\((0,0)\\) to \\((\\frac{4}{3}, 1)\\)\n2. **Triangle:** From \\((\\frac{4}{3}, 1)\\) to \\((\\frac{5}{3}, 0)\\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Rectangle Area:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Width} = \\frac{4}{3}, \\quad \\text{Height} = 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n2. **Triangle Area:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Base} = \\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}, \\quad \\text{Height} = 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\n3. **Total Area of Quadrilateral:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{8}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{9}{6} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Summing the areas of the rectangle and triangle gives us the total area of the quadrilateral. This step is crucial to ensure accuracy in the final probability calculation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating the Total Area of the Rectangle**\n\nThe rectangle's dimensions are straightforward:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Width} = 2, \\quad \\text{Height} = 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** No complications here. The total area is essential for determining the probability.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Determining the Probability**\n\nNow, compute the probability as the ratio of the quadrilateral's area to the rectangle's total area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Area of Quadrilateral}}{\\text{Total Area of Rectangle}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** The probability \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) indicates that 75% of the rectangle's area is closer to the origin. This seems reasonable given the position of the boundary line.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Since the line \\( 3x + y = 5 \\) cuts through the rectangle, creating a large quadrilateral area, a probability of \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) aligns with our graphical interpretation.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Symmetry Considerations**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Initially, I considered leveraging symmetry to simplify the problem. However, since the point \\((3,1)\\) lies outside the rectangle and isn't symmetrically placed relative to the origin, symmetry doesn't provide a clear advantage here.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The **Distance Formula** approach remains the most effective strategy for this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer Recap**\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}\\)\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected point \\( P \\) is closer to the origin than to the point \\((3,1)\\) is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Reflections**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Starting with the distance formula was effective in defining the boundary between regions closer to the origin and \\((3,1)\\).\n\n- **Checkpoints:** Frequent checks, such as verifying intersection points and calculating areas separately, ensured accuracy in the final probability.\n\n- **Brainstorming Helpfulness:** Initially considering multiple strategies helped in selecting the most straightforward path, even though symmetry didn't apply.\n\n- **Overall Confidence:** By cross-verifying the result through different methods (algebraic and graphical), the final answer is reliable.\n\n---\n\nBy thoroughly exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the outcome, we confidently arrive at the correct probability of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\). This structured approach ensures that all aspects of the problem are considered, leading to a robust and accurate solution.",
  "ground_truth": "The area of the rectangular region is 2. Hence the probability that $P$ is closer to $(0,0)$ than it is to $(3,1)$ is half the area of the trapezoid bounded by the lines $y=1$, the $x$- and $y$-axes, and the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining $(0,0)$ and $(3,1)$. The perpendicular bisector goes through the point $(3/2,1/2)$, which is the center of the square whose vertices are $(1,0), (2,0), (2,1), \\text{ and\n}(1,1)$. Hence, the line cuts the square  into two quadrilaterals of equal  area $1/2$. Thus the area of the trapezoid is $3/2$ and the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((-1,0)--(4,0),Arrow);\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,3),Arrow);\nfor (int i=0; i<4; ++i) {\ndraw((i,-0.2)--(i,0.2));\n}\nfor (int i=0; i<3; ++i) {\ndraw((-0.2,i)--(0.2,i));\n}\nlabel(\"$x$\",(3.7,0),S);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,2.7),W);\nlabel(\"1\",(1,-0.2),S);\nlabel(\"2\",(2,-0.2),S);\nlabel(\"3\",(3,-0.2),S);\nlabel(\"1\",(-0.2,1),W);\nlabel(\"2\",(-0.2,2),W);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((1,2)--(2,-1),linewidth(0.7));\ndot((1.5,0.5));\ndot((3,1));\ndraw((1,0)--(1,1.3),dashed);\ndraw((1.5,0.5)--(1.7,1.5));\nlabel(\"($\\frac{3}{2}$,$\\frac{1}{2}$)\",(1.7,1.5),N);\ndraw((0,1)--(2,1)--(2,0),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$(3,1)$\",(3,1),N);\n[/asy]"
