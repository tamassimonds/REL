    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were working through it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check if my approach is correct, and adjust as needed. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, I'm looking at this expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^3-x^2-21x+45}=\\frac{A}{x+5}+\\frac{B}{x-3} + \\frac{C}{(x - 3)^2}\n\\]\n\nI need to find the value of \\( A \\). My initial reaction is that this looks like a **partial fraction decomposition** problem. I've dealt with similar problems before, where I decompose a rational function into simpler fractions to make integration or evaluation easier.\n\nBut wait, let's ensure that this approach fits the problem. **Partial fraction decomposition** typically applies when we have a polynomial denominator that can be factored into linear and/or quadratic terms. Here, the denominator is a cubic polynomial, so factoring it might be a good starting point.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Factoring the Denominator:**\n   - If I can factor the cubic polynomial into linear factors, I can then match it with the partial fractions given and solve for \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\).\n\n2. **Setting Up Partial Fractions:**\n   - Once factored, equate both sides and solve for the constants by substituting specific values of \\( x \\) that simplify the equation.\n\n3. **Using Polynomial Long Division:**\n   - If needed, but since the numerator is 1 (a constant), this might not be necessary here.\n\nI'm leaning towards **factoring the denominator first** because that would directly align the given partial fractions with the factors. Let's go with that.\n\n### **Step 1: Factoring the Denominator**\n\nI need to factor \\( x^3 - x^2 - 21x + 45 \\). Factoring cubics can be tricky, so I might start by looking for **obvious roots** using the **Rational Root Theorem**. It suggests that any rational root \\( p/q \\) is a factor of the constant term (45) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient (1).\n\nPossible rational roots are \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 9, \\pm 15, \\pm 45 \\).\n\nLet's test them:\n\n- **Testing \\( x = 3 \\):**\n  \\[\n  3^3 - 3^2 - 21 \\times 3 + 45 = 27 - 9 - 63 + 45 = 0\n  \\]\n  **Reflection:** Oh, \\( x = 3 \\) is a root! That's great because it means \\( x - 3 \\) is a factor.\n\n**Now, I'll perform polynomial division** to factor out \\( x - 3 \\) from the cubic polynomial.\n\n### **Step 2: Polynomial Division**\n\nDivide \\( x^3 - x^2 - 21x + 45 \\) by \\( x - 3 \\):\n\n1. **First Term:**\n   - \\( x^3 \\div x = x^2 \\)\n   - Multiply \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x - 3 \\): \\( x^3 - 3x^2 \\)\n   - Subtract: \n     \\[\n     (x^3 - x^2) - (x^3 - 3x^2) = 2x^2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n   - \\( 2x^2 \\div x = 2x \\)\n   - Multiply \\( 2x \\) by \\( x - 3 \\): \\( 2x^2 - 6x \\)\n   - Subtract:\n     \\[\n     (2x^2 - 21x) - (2x^2 - 6x) = -15x\n     \\]\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n   - \\( -15x \\div x = -15 \\)\n   - Multiply \\( -15 \\) by \\( x - 3 \\): \\( -15x + 45 \\)\n   - Subtract:\n     \\[\n     (-15x + 45) - (-15x + 45) = 0\n     \\]\n\n**Result of Division:**\n\\[\nx^3 - x^2 - 21x + 45 = (x - 3)(x^2 + 2x - 15)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Hooray! The division worked out perfectly with no remainder, confirming that \\( x - 3 \\) is a factor.\n\n### **Step 3: Factoring the Quadratic**\n\nNow, I need to factor \\( x^2 + 2x - 15 \\). This is a quadratic, so I can attempt to factor it into two linear terms.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-15\\) and add to \\(2\\):\n\n- **Numbers:** 5 and -3\n\nSo,\n\\[\nx^2 + 2x - 15 = (x + 5)(x - 3)\n\\]\n\n**Wait a minute!** That means our original cubic can be factored as:\n\\[\nx^3 - x^2 - 21x + 45 = (x - 3)(x + 5)(x - 3) = (x - 3)^2(x + 5)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This matches the denominators in the given partial fractions. Great progress!\n\n### **Step 4: Setting Up the Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\nNow, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{(x - 3)^2(x + 5)} = \\frac{A}{x + 5} + \\frac{B}{x - 3} + \\frac{C}{(x - 3)^2}\n\\]\n\nTo combine the right side into a single fraction, I'll need a common denominator, which is \\((x - 3)^2(x + 5)\\).\n\n**Expressing Each Term with the Common Denominator:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A}{x + 5} = \\frac{A(x - 3)^2}{(x - 3)^2(x + 5)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{x - 3} = \\frac{B(x - 3)(x + 5)}{(x - 3)^2(x + 5)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{(x - 3)^2} = \\frac{C(x + 5)}{(x - 3)^2(x + 5)}\n\\]\n\n**Adding Them Together:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A(x - 3)^2 + B(x - 3)(x + 5) + C(x + 5)}{(x - 3)^2(x + 5)} = \\frac{1}{(x - 3)^2(x + 5)}\n\\]\n\nSince the denominators are equal, I can equate the numerators:\n\n\\[\nA(x - 3)^2 + B(x - 3)(x + 5) + C(x + 5) = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Now, I have a single equation with three unknowns (\\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\)). I'll need to find specific values of \\(x\\) that simplify this equation to solve for these constants.\n\n### **Step 5: Solving for Constants Using Specific Values of \\(x\\)**\n\nA common strategy is to choose values of \\(x\\) that make some terms zero, simplifying the equation to solve for one constant at a time.\n\n**Choice 1: \\(x = -5\\)**\n\n- This makes the terms involving \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) non-zero but simplifies other terms.\n\n\\[\nA((-5) - 3)^2 + B((-5) - 3)(-5 + 5) + C(-5 + 5) = 1\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nA(8)^2 + B(-8)(0) + C(0) = 1 \\\\\n64A = 1 \\\\\nA = \\frac{1}{64}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\n- \\((-5) - 3 = -8\\), and \\((-5) + 5 = 0\\), so the term with \\(B\\) vanishes.\n- Only the \\(A\\) term remains: \\(64A = 1 \\Rightarrow A = \\frac{1}{64}\\).\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**  \nGiven the setup, it looks correct. But I find it a bit suspicious that \\(A\\) turned out to be such a neat fraction. Let me proceed to solve for \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) to confirm.\n\n**Choice 2: \\(x = 3\\)**\n\n- This will eliminate the terms involving \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), leaving only \\(A\\).\n\n\\[\nA(3 - 3)^2 + B(3 - 3)(3 + 5) + C(3 + 5) = 1\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nA(0) + B(0)(8) + C(8) = 1 \\\\\n8C = 1 \\\\\nC = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, so \\(C = \\frac{1}{8}\\). This seems consistent. Now, I'll need to find \\(B\\).\n\n**Choice 3: Another Value of \\(x\\) (e.g., \\(x = 0\\))**\n\n- With \\(x = 0\\), I'll have:\n\n\\[\nA(0 - 3)^2 + B(0 - 3)(0 + 5) + C(0 + 5) = 1\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nA(9) + B(-3)(5) + C(5) = 1 \\\\\n9A - 15B + 5C = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** I now have an equation involving \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). Since I already found \\(A = \\frac{1}{64}\\) and \\(C = \\frac{1}{8}\\), I can substitute these values to solve for \\(B\\).\n\n### **Step 6: Solving for \\(B\\)**\n\nSubstitute \\(A = \\frac{1}{64}\\) and \\(C = \\frac{1}{8}\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n9\\left(\\frac{1}{64}\\right) - 15B + 5\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = 1\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{64} - 15B + \\frac{5}{8} = 1\n\\]\n\nConvert \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) to a denominator of 64:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{40}{64}\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{64} + \\frac{40}{64} - 15B = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{49}{64} - 15B = 1\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\(\\frac{49}{64}\\) from both sides:\n\\[\n-15B = 1 - \\frac{49}{64} = \\frac{64}{64} - \\frac{49}{64} = \\frac{15}{64}\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by -15:\n\\[\nB = \\frac{15}{64} \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{15}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{64}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, \\(B = -\\frac{1}{64}\\). Everything seems to be falling into place. Let me quickly recap:\n\n- \\(A = \\frac{1}{64}\\)\n- \\(B = -\\frac{1}{64}\\)\n- \\(C = \\frac{1}{8}\\)\n\n**Wait a second!** These values seem consistent, but let me verify by substituting back into the original equation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n### **Step 7: Verification**\n\nLet's plug these values back into the partial fraction setup to see if they satisfy the original equation.\n\nGiven:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{(x - 3)^2(x + 5)} = \\frac{A}{x + 5} + \\frac{B}{x - 3} + \\frac{C}{(x - 3)^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{(x - 3)^2(x + 5)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{64}}{x + 5} + \\frac{-\\frac{1}{64}}{x - 3} + \\frac{\\frac{1}{8}}{(x - 3)^2}\n\\]\n\nCombine the right side into a single fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{64}(x - 3)^2 + \\frac{-\\frac{1}{64}}(x - 3)(x + 5) + \\frac{\\frac{1}{8}}(x + 5)}{(x - 3)^2(x + 5)}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator step by step:\n\n1. **First Term:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{64}(x - 3)^2 = \\frac{1}{64}(x^2 - 6x + 9)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{1}{64}(x - 3)(x + 5) = -\\frac{1}{64}(x^2 + 5x - 3x - 15) = -\\frac{1}{64}(x^2 + 2x - 15)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{8}(x + 5)\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's combine them:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{64}(x^2 - 6x + 9) - \\frac{1}{64}(x^2 + 2x - 15) + \\frac{1}{8}(x + 5)\n\\]\n\n**Combining Like Terms:**\n\n1. **Combine the First Two Terms:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{64}\\left[(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 + 2x - 15)\\right] \\\\\n   = \\frac{1}{64}(x^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 - 2x + 15) \\\\\n   = \\frac{1}{64}(-8x + 24)\n   \\]\n\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{-8x + 24}{64} = \\frac{-x + 3}{8}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the Third Term:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-x + 3}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}(x + 5) \\\\\n   = \\frac{-x + 3 + x + 5}{8} \\\\\n   = \\frac{8}{8} = 1\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wow, the numerator simplifies to 1, which matches the left side of the original equation. This confirms that the values of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are indeed correct.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter working through the problem step by step and verifying the solution, we find that:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{64}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:** \n\nThis problem required careful application of partial fraction decomposition, factoring, and solving equations. By systematically testing strategies, checking each step, and verifying the final result, I ensured the correctness of the solution. It's crucial to continually reflect and verify, especially when dealing with algebraic manipulations, to avoid and catch any potential errors.",
