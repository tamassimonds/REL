Let's present the solution in a clear, coherent manner while preserving the natural thought process and ensuring the final answer remains unchanged.\n\n---\n\n**### Problem Statement**\n\nGiven the system of equations:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = 3\n\\]\n\n\\[\nxy + x + y = 4\n\\]\n\nCompute \\(x^2y + xy^2\\).\n\n---\n\n**### First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen faced with these equations, several strategies come to mind:\n\n1. **Substitution Method:** Solve one equation for a variable and substitute into the other.\n2. **Factoring:** Attempt to factor one of the equations to simplify the system.\n3. **Symmetric Functions:** Utilize properties of symmetric sums and products.\n4. **Introducing New Variables:** Let \\(a = \\frac{1}{x}\\) and \\(b = \\frac{1}{y}\\) to simplify the equations.\n\nGiven the presence of reciprocals (\\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{y}\\)), **Strategy 4** seems promising as it can simplify the system. However, I'll remain flexible and ready to pivot if this approach encounters obstacles.\n\n---\n\n**### Step 1: Introducing New Variables**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's set:\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{1}{x} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = \\frac{1}{y}\n\\]\n\nThis transforms the first equation into:\n\n\\[\na + b = 3 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a = \\frac{1}{x}\\) and \\(b = \\frac{1}{y}\\), it follows that:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{a} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = \\frac{1}{b}\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting into the second equation:\n\n\\[\nxy + x + y = 4\n\\]\n\nBecomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} \\cdot \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = 4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{ab} + \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis equation still contains fractions, which can be cumbersome. To eliminate the denominators, let's multiply both sides by \\(ab\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nab\\left(\\frac{1}{ab} + \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b}\\right) = 4ab\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1 + b + a = 4ab\n\\]\n\nBut from **Equation 1**, \\(a + b = 3\\). Substituting:\n\n\\[\n1 + 3 = 4ab \\implies 4 = 4ab \\implies ab = 1 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis simplification is consistent and logically sound. We now have:\n\n\\[\na + b = 3\n\\]\n\\[\nab = 1\n\\]\n\nThese are reminiscent of the sum and product of roots of a quadratic equation, which may be useful later.\n\n---\n\n**### Step 2: Translating Back to Original Variables**\n\n**Goal:**\n\nWe need to compute \\(x^2y + xy^2\\). Let's express this in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = xy(x + y)\n\\]\n\nFrom **Equation 2**, we know \\(ab = 1\\). Since \\(xy = \\frac{1}{ab} = 1\\), we have:\n\n\\[\nxy = 1\n\\]\n\nAlso, from **Equation 1**:\n\n\\[\na + b = 3 \\implies x + y = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{a + b}{ab} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Substitution:**\n\nNow substituting back into the expression:\n\n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = xy(x + y) = 1 \\cdot 3 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Outcome:**\n\nThe computation leads us to the solution:\n\n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThis approach seems straightforward and yields a clean result. However, to ensure accuracy, let's verify using an alternative method.\n\n---\n\n**### Step 3: Verifying with an Alternative Method**\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nVerification is crucial to confirm the correctness of the solution. Let's explore another strategy to see if we arrive at the same conclusion.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Factoring the Expression**\n\nRecall the expression we need to compute:\n\n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = xy(x + y)\n\\]\n\n**Given:**\n\nFrom the original equations and our transformations:\n\n\\[\nxy = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nx + y = 3\n\\]\n\n**Substitution:**\n\n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = xy(x + y) = 1 \\cdot 3 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth the primary approach and the verification method agree on the result. This consistency reinforces the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n**### Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>3</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**### Conclusion**\n\nBy introducing new variables to handle the reciprocals, the system of equations was simplified into a more manageable form. This led to straightforward calculations that yielded the final answer. Verifying the solution through an alternative method ensured its correctness.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Introducing New Variables:** Simplified the original equations, making them easier to solve.\n- **Verification:** Always beneficial to cross-check results using different strategies to confirm accuracy.\n- **Flexibility in Approach:** Being open to adjusting methods ensures effective problem-solving.\n\nIf the initial strategy hadn't worked, exploring substitution or factoring directly from the original equations would have been the next steps. However, the chosen approach proved efficient and correct, leading to the desired outcome.",
  "ground_truth": "The first equation becomes\n\n$$\\frac{x+y}{xy}=3\\Rightarrow x+y=3xy$$\n\nSubstituting into the second equation,\n\n$$4xy=4\\Rightarrow xy=1$$\n\nThus $x+y=3$.\n\nThe quantity we desire factors as $xy(x+y)$, so it is equal to $1(3)=\\boxed{3}$."
