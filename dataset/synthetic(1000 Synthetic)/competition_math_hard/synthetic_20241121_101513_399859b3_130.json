  "problem": "A street has 20 houses on each side, for a total of 40 houses. The addresses on the south side of the street form an arithmetic sequence, as do the addresses on the north side of the street. On the south side, the addresses are 4, 10, 16, etc., and on the north side they are 3, 9, 15, etc. A sign painter paints house numbers on a house for $\\$1$ per digit. If he paints the appropriate house number once on each of these 40 houses, how many dollars does he collect?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step as if I'm working through it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have a street with **40 houses total**\u201420 on each side. Each side's addresses form an **arithmetic sequence**:\n\n- **South Side:** 4, 10, 16, ...\n- **North Side:** 3, 9, 15, ...\n\nA sign painter charges **$1 per digit** to paint each house number. Our goal is to determine **how much money he collects** by painting all 40 houses.\n\n**<Reflection>**  \nAt first glance, this looks like a problem involving arithmetic sequences and counting digits. I need to figure out the total number of digits in all the house numbers to determine the total cost. But wait, there might be different ways to approach this\u2014should I list all the house numbers or find a pattern? Let\u2019s brainstorm.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **List All House Numbers and Count Digits:**  \n   - Write out each house number and manually count the digits.\n   - **Pros:** Simple and straightforward.\n   - **Cons:** Time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\n2. **Identify Patterns in Digit Counts:**  \n   - Determine how many house numbers have 1 digit, 2 digits, etc.\n   - Use arithmetic properties to simplify counting.\n   - **Pros:** More efficient than listing.\n   - **Cons:** Requires spotting patterns correctly.\n\n3. **Use Mathematical Formulas for Arithmetic Sequences:**  \n   - Calculate the total number of digits using formulas.\n   - **Pros:** Potentially the quickest method.\n   - **Cons:** Might be overcomplicated for this problem.\n\n**<Moment of Realization>**  \nActually, listing all the numbers might be the best way to ensure accuracy, given there are only 40 houses. It will allow me to verify patterns as well.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Listing All House Numbers**\n\n**<Approach>**  \nLet's start by listing all the addresses for both the south and north sides to see how many digits each number has.\n\n#### **South Side Addresses**\n\nThe sequence starts at 4 and increases by 6 each time:\n\n- 4, 10, 16, ...\n\n**<Calculation>**  \nI need to find all 20 addresses. Let's write them out:\n\n1. 4\n2. 10\n3. 16\n4. 22\n5. 28\n6. 34\n7. 40\n8. 46\n9. 52\n10. 58\n11. 64\n12. 70\n13. 76\n14. 82\n15. 88\n16. 94\n17. 100\n18. 106\n19. 112\n20. 118\n\n**<Wait a Minute>**  \nHmm, I reached 100 at the 17th house. Let me double-check the increments:\n\n- Starting at 4, adding 6 each time:\n  - 4 + 6 = 10\n  - 10 + 6 = 16\n  - ...\n\nYep, that seems correct. So, the 17th house is **100**, and it continues beyond 100.\n\n#### **North Side Addresses**\n\nThe sequence starts at 3 and increases by 6 each time:\n\n- 3, 9, 15, ...\n\n**<Calculation>**  \nLet's list all 20 addresses:\n\n1. 3\n2. 9\n3. 15\n4. 21\n5. 27\n6. 33\n7. 39\n8. 45\n9. 51\n10. 57\n11. 63\n12. 69\n13. 75\n14. 81\n15. 87\n16. 93\n17. 99\n18. 105\n19. 111\n20. 117\n\n**<Initial Check>**  \nOkay, I've listed all 40 addresses. Now, I need to count the digits for each.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Counting the Digits**\n\n**<Approach>**  \nI'll count how many house numbers have 1 digit, 2 digits, and 3 digits. This will help me calculate the total cost.\n\n#### **South Side Digit Counts**\n\n**<Listing and Counting>**\n\n1. **1-Digit:**  \n   - 4  \n   - Total: 1 house\n\n2. **2-Digits:**  \n   - 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46, 52, 58, 64, 70, 76, 82, 88, 94  \n   - Total: 15 houses\n\n3. **3-Digits:**  \n   - 100, 106, 112, 118  \n   - Total: 4 houses\n\n**<Quick Check>**  \n1 + 15 + 4 = 20 houses  \nThat adds up correctly.\n\n#### **North Side Digit Counts**\n\n**<Listing and Counting>**\n\n1. **1-Digit:**  \n   - 3, 9  \n   - Total: 2 houses\n\n2. **2-Digits:**  \n   - 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81, 87, 93, 99  \n   - Total: 15 houses\n\n3. **3-Digits:**  \n   - 105, 111, 117  \n   - Total: 3 houses\n\n**<Quick Check>**  \n2 + 15 + 3 = 20 houses  \nThat also adds up correctly.\n\n**<Reflection>**  \nSo far, so good. The totals for both sides add up to 40 houses. Now, let's calculate the total cost based on the number of digits.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Total Cost**\n\n**<Approach>**  \nEach digit costs $1 to paint. Therefore, I'll multiply the number of houses by the number of digits in their addresses and sum it all up.\n\n#### **South Side Cost**\n\n**<Calculation>**\n\n- **1-Digit Houses:**  \n  - 1 house \u00d7 1 digit = 1 digit\n\n- **2-Digit Houses:**  \n  - 15 houses \u00d7 2 digits = 30 digits\n\n- **3-Digit Houses:**  \n  - 4 houses \u00d7 3 digits = 12 digits\n\n**<Total for South Side>**  \n1 + 30 + 12 = 43 digits  \nSo, the cost for the south side is **$43**.\n\n#### **North Side Cost**\n\n**<Calculation>**\n\n- **1-Digit Houses:**  \n  - 2 houses \u00d7 1 digit = 2 digits\n\n- **2-Digit Houses:**  \n  - 15 houses \u00d7 2 digits = 30 digits\n\n- **3-Digit Houses:**  \n  - 3 houses \u00d7 3 digits = 9 digits\n\n**<Total for North Side>**  \n2 + 30 + 9 = 41 digits  \nSo, the cost for the north side is **$41**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Adding Both Sides Together**\n\n**<Calculation>**  \nTotal cost = South Side Cost + North Side Cost  \nTotal cost = $43 + $41 = **$84**\n\n**<Final Check>**  \nLet me quickly verify:\n\n- South Side: 43 digits\n- North Side: 41 digits\n- Total: 84 digits\n\nEverything seems to add up correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy listing all the house numbers and counting the digits, I ensured accuracy in calculating the total cost. Initially, I considered finding patterns or using formulas, but given the manageable number of houses, listing them was the most straightforward and error-proof method. Checking my work at each step helped confirm the correctness of the approach.\n\n**<Final Answer>**  \nThe sign painter collects **$84** in total.\n\n---\n\n**<End Reflection>**  \nBy taking a methodical approach, brainstorming different strategies, and continuously reflecting and checking my work, I arrived at the correct solution.\n\nAlright, that's it! By ensuring each step was carefully thought out and verified, I was able to confidently determine the total cost.",
  "ground_truth": "Using the formulas for arithmetic sequences, we see that the $20^{\\text{th}}$ number for the north side is $3+6(20-1)=117$ and the $20^{\\text{th}}$ number for the south side is $4+6(20-1)=118$. Also, we see that a north side house number is always 3 more than a multiple of 6, and a south side house number is always 4 more than a multiple of 6. We can then distribute the house numbers for the north and south sides into 3 groups each by the number of digits: \\[\\text{North side:}\\qquad\\{3, 9\\},\\qquad\\{15, \\ldots, 99\\},\\qquad\\{105, 111, 117\\}\\] \\[\\text{South side:}\\qquad\\{4\\},\\qquad\\{10, \\ldots, 94\\},\\qquad\\{100, \\ldots, 118\\}\\] The north side has 2 houses with one digit house numbers, and 3 houses with three digit house numbers, so it must have $20-2-3=15$ houses with two digit house numbers.\n\nThe south side has 1 house with one digit house numbers, and 4 houses with three digits house numbers, so it must have $20-1-4=15$ houses with two digit address. Thus, the total cost is \\[(1\\times2+2\\times15+3\\times3)+(1\\times1+2\\times15+3\\times4) = \\boxed{84}\\] dollars."
