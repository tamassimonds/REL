    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step to ensure correctness, and adjust my approach if needed. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts:  \n- **What's given?**\n  - A rhombus with each side measuring **51 units**.\n  - The **shorter diagonal** is **48 units**.\n- **What's the goal?**\n  - Find the length of the **longer diagonal**.\n\nImmediate reaction:  \nI remember that in a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This reminds me of the Pythagorean theorem and properties of right triangles. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the best approach right now. Let me brainstorm some strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**  \n   - Since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, each diagonal forms two right triangles with the sides.\n   - Maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing diagonal.\n\n2. **Apply Trigonometry:**  \n   - Perhaps using sine or cosine could help, given the angles involved in the rhombus.\n\n3. **Vector Approach:**  \n   - Representing the rhombus using vectors might provide another way to calculate the diagonals.\n\nFirst instinct:  \nThe **Pythagorean theorem** seems the most straightforward since I already have one diagonal and the side length. I'll start with that, but I'll keep the other methods in mind just in case.\n\n---\n\n### **Attempting the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\n**Step 1: Visualize the Rhombus**\n\n- Each diagonal bisects the rhombus into four right triangles.\n- Given:\n  - Side length \\(s = 51\\) units\n  - Shorter diagonal \\(d_1 = 48\\) units\n- Need to find the longer diagonal \\(d_2\\).\n\nReflection:  \nBy splitting the rhombus with its diagonals, each right triangle has:\n- Hypotenuse = side of the rhombus = 51 units\n- One leg = half of the shorter diagonal = \\(48/2 = 24\\) units\n- Other leg = half of the longer diagonal = \\(d_2/2\\) units\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to One of the Right Triangles**\n\nFormula:  \n\\[\n\\text{leg}_1^2 + \\text{leg}_2^2 = \\text{hypotenuse}^2\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:  \n\\[\n24^2 + \\left(\\frac{d_2}{2}\\right)^2 = 51^2\n\\]\n\nCalculations:  \n\\[\n576 + \\left(\\frac{d_2^2}{4}\\right) = 2601\n\\]\n\nReflection:  \nWait, let me isolate \\(d_2^2\\) to make it easier.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Equation**\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:  \n\\[\n2304 + d_2^2 = 10404\n\\]\n\nSubtract 2304 from both sides:  \n\\[\nd_2^2 = 10404 - 2304 = 8100\n\\]\n\nReflection:  \nLooks good so far. Now, let's find \\(d_2\\) by taking the square root.\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\(d_2\\)**\n\n\\[\nd_2 = \\sqrt{8100} = 90 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Solution**\n\nQuick sanity check:  \n- The longer diagonal should be greater than the shorter one (48 units) and less than twice the side length (102 units).\n- \\(d_2 = 90\\) units falls within this range.\n\nReflection:  \nEverything seems to align correctly. The length of the longer diagonal makes sense given the dimensions of the rhombus.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**<ANSWER>90\\text{ units}</ANSWER> solution**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nLooking back:  \n- The Pythagorean theorem was the right choice here.\n- Trigonometry or vectors would have worked too but might have been more complex.\n- Always good to visualize and verify at each step to ensure the approach is correct.\n\nI'm glad I started with the Pythagorean theorem, checked my calculations along the way, and confirmed the plausibility of the final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "The diagonals of a rhombus divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.  The legs of these right triangles are half as long as the diagonals of the rhombus.  Therefore, the sum of the squares of the half-diagonals of a rhombus is equal to the square of the side length.  Since one of the half-diagonals is $24$, the other half-diagonal is $\\sqrt{51^2-24^2}=3\\sqrt{17^2-8^2}=3\\cdot15=45$.  Therefore, the length of the missing diagonal is $45\\cdot 2=\\boxed{90}$ units."
