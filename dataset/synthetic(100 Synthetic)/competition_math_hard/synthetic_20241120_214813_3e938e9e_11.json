    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were working it out on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Here's how I'll proceed:\n\n### First Thoughts\n\nWhen I first read the question, it seems to be about comparing the unit prices of two soda brands, X and Y. Brand X claims to offer **20% more soda** for a price that's **10% less** than Brand Y. I need to find the ratio of Brand X's unit price to Brand Y's unit price.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- This sounds like a problem involving percentages and ratios.\n- I might need to set up some equations to represent the quantities and prices.\n- I'm considering using variables to represent the volume and price, then calculating the unit prices.\n\nBut wait... I'm not entirely sure how to start. Maybe I should explore different strategies.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Assigning Variables:**\n   - Let\u2019s say Brand Y has a certain volume and price.\n   - Brand X would then have 20% more volume and a price that's 10% less.\n\n2. **Using Specific Numbers:**\n   - Perhaps assigning concrete numbers to Brand Y's volume and price could make it easier to visualize.\n\n3. **Setting Up Ratios Directly:**\n   - Maybe I can directly set up the ratio of unit prices based on the given percentages.\n\nHmm... using specific numbers might simplify things and help me check my work more easily. Let's try that.\n\n### Strategy 1: Assigning Specific Values\n\n**Assumption:**\n- Let\u2019s assume Brand Y sells **100 units** of soda for **$100**.\n  \nThis makes the calculations straightforward since percentages will be easy to compute.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Brand Y:**\n   - Volume = 100 units\n   - Price = $100\n   - Unit Price = \\( \\frac{100 \\text{ dollars}}{100 \\text{ units}} = 1 \\text{ dollar/unit} \\)\n\n2. **Brand X:**\n   - **20% More Soda:**\n     - \\( 100 \\text{ units} + 20\\% \\times 100 \\text{ units} = 120 \\text{ units} \\)\n   - **10% Less Price:**\n     - \\( 100 \\text{ dollars} - 10\\% \\times 100 \\text{ dollars} = 90 \\text{ dollars} \\)\n   - **Unit Price:**\n     - \\( \\frac{90 \\text{ dollars}}{120 \\text{ units}} = \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ dollars/unit} \\)\n\n**Ratio of Unit Prices:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Unit Price of X}}{\\text{Unit Price of Y}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{4}}{1} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This approach seems straightforward and gives a clear answer.\n- But I should verify if this method is universally correct by trying a different strategy.\n\n### Strategy 2: Using Variables\n\n**Setup:**\n- Let\u2019s use variables to represent Brand Y\u2019s volume and price.\n  - Let \\( V_Y \\) be the volume of Brand Y.\n  - Let \\( P_Y \\) be the price of Brand Y.\n  \n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Brand Y\u2019s Unit Price:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Unit Price}_Y = \\frac{P_Y}{V_Y}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Brand X:**\n   - **20% More Volume:**\n     \\[\n     V_X = V_Y + 0.2 \\times V_Y = 1.2 \\times V_Y\n     \\]\n   - **10% Less Price:**\n     \\[\n     P_X = P_Y - 0.1 \\times P_Y = 0.9 \\times P_Y\n     \\]\n   - **Unit Price:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Unit Price}_X = \\frac{P_X}{V_X} = \\frac{0.9 \\times P_Y}{1.2 \\times V_Y} = \\frac{0.9}{1.2} \\times \\frac{P_Y}{V_Y} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\text{Unit Price}_Y\n     \\]\n\n**Ratio of Unit Prices:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Unit Price}_X}{\\text{Unit Price}_Y} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Both strategies yield the same result, which boosts my confidence in the answer.\n- Using variables confirms that the ratio is independent of the actual values of volume and price.\n\n### Checking the Work\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Brand X offers more soda for less money, so its unit price should be lower than Brand Y's.\n- A ratio of \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) means Brand X's unit price is 75% of Brand Y's, which makes sense.\n\n**Deep Reflection:**\n- Since both methods (assigning specific values and using variables) agree, the solution is likely correct.\n- There's consistency in the calculations, and the logic aligns with the problem statement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying the calculations, and ensuring consistency, I've determined that the ratio of the unit price of Brand X soda to Brand Y soda is:\n\n\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\n\nIn <ANSWER> solution</ANSWER> format:\n\n<ANSWER> \n\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) \nsolution</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- Taking the time to brainstorm and verify different methods helped ensure the correctness of the solution.\n- Assigning specific values simplified the problem initially, but using variables provided a general proof.\n- Always good to cross-check with multiple approaches to confirm the accuracy.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $v$ be the volume of soda in Brand Y, and let $p$ be the price of Brand Y soda. Thus, the volume of soda in Brand X is $1.2v$, and the price of Brand X soda is $.9p$.\n\nIt follows that the unit price of Brand X soda is $.9p/1.2v = 3p/4v$, and the unit price of Brand Y soda is $p/v$. The ratio of these unit prices is: $$\\dfrac{\\dfrac{3p}{4v}}{\\dfrac{p}{v}} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.$$"
