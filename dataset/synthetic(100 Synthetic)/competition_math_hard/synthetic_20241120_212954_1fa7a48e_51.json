  "problem": "There is a machine with 8 toys in it that each cost between 25 cents and 2 dollars, with each toy being 25 cents more expensive than the next most expensive one. Each time Sam presses the big red button on the machine, the machine randomly selects one of the remaining toys and gives Sam the option to buy it. If Sam has enough money, he will buy the toy, the red button will light up again, and he can repeat the process. If Sam has 8 quarters and a ten dollar bill and the machine only accepts quarters, what is the probability that Sam has to get change for the 10 dollar bill before he can buy his favorite toy- the one that costs $\\$1.75$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem again. I realize my previous approach was a bit tangled, so I'll start fresh, keeping my original insights but refining my strategy as I recognize the missteps. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Thoughts and Understanding**\n\nFirst off, let me unpack the problem to ensure I fully grasp it:\n\n- **Sam's Resources:** Sam has 8 quarters ($2.00) and a ten-dollar bill.\n- **Machine Details:** There are 8 toys, each priced between 25 cents and 2 dollars, with each toy costing 25 cents more than the next cheaper one.\n- **Favorite Toy:** Sam's favorite toy costs $1.75.\n- **Payment Limitation:** The machine only accepts quarters.\n- **Objective:** Determine the probability that Sam needs to get change for the ten-dollar bill before he can buy the $1.75 toy.\n\n**First Impressions:**\n- Sam has $2.00 in quarters, and the favorite toy costs $1.75, so he has enough quarters to buy it directly.\n- However, if Sam buys other toys before the $1.75 one, he might run out of quarters and need to break the ten-dollar bill.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **List All Toy Prices:** Identify the exact prices of the 8 toys.\n2. **Simulate the Buying Process:** Consider the order in which toys are dispensed and how it affects Sam's spending.\n3. **Calculate Probabilities:** Determine the likelihood of Sam needing change before buying the $1.75 toy.\n\n**Does This Approach Make Sense?**\nYes, starting by listing toy prices and simulating different buying scenarios will help in calculating the probability. But I realize I need a more structured approach to avoid getting lost in details.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Listing All Toy Prices**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince each toy costs 25 cents more than the next cheaper one, let's list their prices starting from the cheapest.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Toy 1: $0.25\n- Toy 2: $0.50\n- Toy 3: $0.75\n- Toy 4: $1.00\n- Toy 5: $1.25\n- Toy 6: $1.50\n- Toy 7: $1.75 (Sam's favorite)\n- Toy 8: $2.00\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, now I have a clear picture of all toy prices. Totaling them gives $9.00, which fits within the given constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simulating the Buying Process**\n\n**Initial Approach:**\nI initially thought of simulating different scenarios where the $1.75 toy appears at various positions. However, I realize this could become cumbersome with 8! (40,320) possible sequences.\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\nThis method isn't practical. I need a more efficient way to calculate probabilities without manually listing every sequence.\n\n**New Strategy:**\nInstead of simulating every sequence, I'll calculate the probability that Sam can buy the $1.75 toy without needing change and then use complementary probability to find the desired probability.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up Probability Calculation Using Complementary Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nCalculate the probability that Sam can buy his favorite toy using only quarters and then subtract this from 1 to find the probability that he needs change.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. **Determine Total Orderings:** Calculate the total number of ways the 8 toys can be dispensed.\n2. **Identify Favorable Orderings:** Count the orderings where Sam can buy the $1.75 toy without breaking the ten-dollar bill.\n3. **Compute Probability:** Use the ratio of favorable orderings to total orderings and subtract from 1.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Total Orderings:** \n   \\[\n   8! = 40,320\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Favorable Orderings:** \n   - If the $1.75 toy is dispensed first: Sam buys it immediately using quarters. There are \\(7!\\) ways to order the remaining toys.\n   - If the $0.25 toy is dispensed first and the $1.75 toy second: Sam spends $0.25, leaving $1.75 in quarters. There are \\(6!\\) ways to order the remaining toys.\n   - **Total Favorable Orderings:**\n     \\[\n     7! + 6! = 5,040 + 720 = 5,760\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Probability of Not Needing Change:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7! + 6!}{8!} = \\frac{5,760}{40,320} = \\frac{1}{7}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Probability of Needing Change:**\n   \\[\n   1 - \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{6}{7}\n   \\]\n\n**Outcome:**\nThe probability that Sam needs to get change before buying the $1.75 toy is \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\).\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**\nYes, this approach is much cleaner and aligns with the problem requirements. By calculating the probability of the complementary event (not needing change), I efficiently arrived at the desired probability.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Validation**\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\nI initially overcomplicated the problem by trying to simulate every possible sequence. By recognizing this and pivoting to complementary probability, I streamlined the solution.\n\n**Actually, Looking at This Again...**\nI see that focusing on the specific orderings where Sam doesn't need change simplifies the calculation significantly. This approach avoids unnecessary complexity and leads directly to the correct answer.\n\n**Hmm, Let Me Double-Check My Reasoning Here...**\n- **Total Orderings:** 8! accounts for all possible sequences of toy dispensing.\n- **Favorable Orderings:** Only two specific scenarios allow Sam to buy the $1.75 toy without needing change.\n- **Probability Calculation:** The ratio of favorable to total orderings correctly represents the probability of not needing change.\n\n**Final Check:**\nThe math checks out, and the logic aligns with the problem's requirements. The probability that Sam needs to get change before buying his favorite toy is indeed \\(\\boxed{\\frac{6}{7}}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy initially attempting to simulate the buying process and recognizing the impracticality of that method, I pivoted to a more efficient approach using complementary probability. This adjustment allowed me to accurately calculate the probability that Sam needs to get change before buying the $1.75 toy, resulting in a final probability of \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We will calculate the probability that Sam can buy his favorite toy just using his 8 quarters and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that we're looking for. There are a total of $8!$ orders in which the 8 toys can be dispensed. If his favorite toy is the first one that the machine selects, then he can obviously buy it just using his quarters, and then there are $7!$ order in which the other toys can be dispensed, which gives us 7! orderings of the toys that let him buy his favorite just using the quarters. If the first toy is the one that only costs 25 cents, then he will be able to buy his favorite toy just using his remaining quarters if and only if it is the second one dispensed. If those are the first two toys dispensed, there are $6!$ ways to order the other toys which means that we have another $6!$ orderings of the toys that allow him to buy his favorite toy without getting change for the 10 dollar bill. If the first toy costs more than 25 cents, or if two toys are dispensed before his favorite one, then he won't have enough quarters to buy his favorite one without getting change for his ten dollar bill. So out of the $8!$ orders in which the 8 toys can be dispensed, there are $7! + 6!$ ways that allow him to buy his favorite toy just using his quarters for a probability of $\\dfrac{7!+6!}{8!}=\\dfrac{6!}{6!}\\cdot\\dfrac{7+1}{8\\cdot7}=\\dfrac{1}{7}$. But that is the probability that what we want $\\emph{doesn't}$ happen, so we need to subtract it from 1 to get our final probability of $1-\\dfrac{1}{7}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{6}{7}}$."
