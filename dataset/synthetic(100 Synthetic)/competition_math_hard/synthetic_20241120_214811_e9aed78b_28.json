  "problem": "Twenty gremlins and fifteen imps are at the Annual Mischief Convention. The imps have had a lot of in-fighting lately and refuse to shake hands with each other, but they readily shake hands with all of the gremlins. Meanwhile, all the gremlins are quite friendly and shake hands with all of the other gremlins as well as imps. Each pair of creatures shakes hands at most once. How many handshakes were at the convention?",

    "working_out": "Certainly! Let's tackle this problem step by step, reflecting on different strategies, checking for correctness, and adjusting our approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- We have two groups: **gremlins** and **imps**.\n- Total creatures: 20 gremlins + 15 imps = **35 creatures**.\n- **Imps** refuse to shake hands with each other.\n- **Imps** shake hands with **all gremlins**.\n- **Gremlins** shake hands with **all other gremlins and all imps**.\n- Each handshake occurs **at most once**.\n\n**Initial Reflection:**\n- It seems we need to calculate handshakes between gremlins themselves and between gremlins and imps.\n- No handshakes occur between imps.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Calculate Handshakes Among Gremlins.**\n2. **Calculate Handshakes Between Gremlins and Imps.**\n3. **Ensure No Double Counting.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Handshakes Among Gremlins**\n\n**Approach:**\n- **Gremlins shake hands with each other.**\n- Use the formula for handshakes within a group:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Handshakes among gremlins} = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n  \\]  \n  where \\( n \\) is the number of gremlins.\n\n**Applying the Formula:**\n- \\( n = 20 \\)\n- \\[\n  \\text{Handshakes among gremlins} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This makes sense as each gremlin shakes hands with 19 others.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- 20 gremlins, each shaking hands with 19 others = 20 x 19 = 380.  \n- But each handshake involves two gremlins, so divide by 2:  \n  \\( \\frac{380}{2} = 190 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **190 handshakes** among gremlins.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Handshakes Between Gremlins and Imps**\n\n**Approach:**\n- **Each imp shakes hands with all gremlins.**\n- Total handshakes = number of imps \u00d7 number of gremlins.\n\n**Calculating:**\n- Number of imps = 15\n- Number of gremlins = 20\n- \\[\n  \\text{Handshakes between gremlins and imps} = 15 \\times 20 = 300\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Each of the 15 imps shakes hands with all 20 gremlins.\n- No handshakes are missing or double-counted here.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- If each imp shakes hands with 20 gremlins:  \n  \\( 15 \\times 20 = 300 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **300 handshakes** between gremlins and imps.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Total Handshakes at the Convention**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Add the handshakes among gremlins to the handshakes between gremlins and imps.\n\n**Calculating Total Handshakes:**\n- \\[\n  \\text{Total handshakes} = 190 \\ (\\text{among gremlins}) + 300 \\ (\\text{gremlins and imps}) = 490\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- No handshakes between imps, so no additional terms are needed.\n- The calculation seems straightforward and logical.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Adding the two components:  \n  \\( 190 + 300 = 490 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **490 total handshakes** at the convention.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Check and Validation**\n\n**Does It Make Sense?**\n- **Gremlins:** 20 individuals shaking hands with each other yields 190 handshakes.\n- **Imps and Gremlins:** 15 imps each shaking hands with 20 gremlins yields 300 handshakes.\n- **No Handshakes Among Imps:** As stated, imps do not shake hands with each other, so no additional handshakes need to be considered.\n\n**Potential Errors:**\n- **Double Counting:** Ensure that handshakes aren't counted twice. In this case, the formula accounts for it by dividing by 2 where necessary.\n- **Neglected Handshakes:** Verify that all possible handshakes are considered. Since imps only shake hands with gremlins and gremlins shake hands with everyone except themselves within their group, all are covered.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- The approach aligns with the problem's conditions.\n- Calculations are consistent and logical.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n  \n<ANSWER>490 total handshakes at the convention.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy breaking down the problem into clear components\u2014handshakes among gremlins and between gremlins and imps\u2014and verifying each step, we ensured accuracy in our solution. Reflecting and checking throughout the process helped confirm that no handshakes were overlooked or double-counted, leading us confidently to the final answer of **490 handshakes**.",

  "ground_truth": "Let us first count the handshakes between two gremlins. There are $20$ gremlins, so there must be $\\dfrac{20 \\cdot 19}{2} = 190$ handshakes between two gremlins, making sure to divide by two to avoid over-counting.\n\nMeanwhile, there are $15$ imps that shake hands with each of the $20$ gremlins, which makes $15 \\cdot 20 = 300$ handshakes between imps and gremlins.\n\nAdding them up, we have $300 + 190 = \\boxed{490}$ total handshakes."
