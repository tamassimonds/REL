    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem again, reflecting on where I might have gone astray the first time. I'll keep my original ideas but make the necessary corrections as I progress.\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first encountered the functional equation:\n\n\\[\nf(f(x) + y) = f(x^2 - y) + 4f(x) y\n\\]\n\nfor all real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), my instinct was to explore various substitution strategies to unravel the function \\(f\\). Here's how I initially approached it:\n\n1. **Substitution Method**: Plug specific values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to derive insights about \\(f(x)\\).\n2. **Assume a General Form**: Consider whether \\(f(x)\\) is linear or follows a particular pattern.\n3. **Set Variables to Zero**: Often simplifies functional equations significantly.\n4. **Symmetry Considerations**: Look for invariances or fixed points.\n\n**First Attempt**: I started by setting \\(y = 0\\) and \\(x = 0\\) to simplify the equation, which led me to some basic relationships but didn't fully solve for \\(f(3)\\). Then, I assumed \\(f(x)\\) might be linear, which suggested \\(f(x) = 0\\) as a solution. However, this only provided a trivial solution, and I concluded that \\(n \\times s = 0\\), which was incorrect.\n\n**Reflection**: Wait a minute, perhaps I overlooked other possible solutions. Functional equations can often have multiple valid forms, and my initial assumption might have been too restrictive. Let's revisit and refine the approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting the Approach**\n\n**New Strategy**: Instead of jumping to conclude that \\(f(x) = 0\\) is the only solution, I should consider that multiple forms of \\(f(x)\\) might satisfy the equation, especially since the problem asks for the number and sum of all possible values of \\(f(3)\\).\n\n**Brainstorming**:\n- Maybe \\(f(x)\\) can be zero for some \\(x\\) and non-zero for others.\n- The functional equation might allow for different behaviors based on the input \\(x\\).\n\n**Let me think...** This reminds me that sometimes functional equations have piecewise solutions or multiple consistent forms.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing the Functional Equation**\n\nLet's start by exploring the original equation more deeply:\n\n\\[\nf(f(x) + y) = f(x^2 - y) + 4f(x) y\n\\]\n\n**Idea**: To find \\(f(3)\\), I need to understand how \\(f\\) behaves at specific points. Substituting different values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) might reveal patterns.\n\n**But wait...** My previous substitutions didn't yield much beyond \\(f(x) = 0\\). Perhaps I need a more insightful substitution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Clever Substitution**\n\n**Insight**: If I set \\(y\\) to depend on \\(x\\) and \\(f(x)\\), I might simplify the equation significantly.\n\n**Let me try...** Let's set \\(y = \\frac{x^2 - f(x)}{2}\\).\n\n**Substitution**: Plugging \\(y = \\frac{x^2 - f(x)}{2}\\) into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf\\left(f(x) + \\frac{x^2 - f(x)}{2}\\right) = f\\left(x^2 - \\frac{x^2 - f(x)}{2}\\right) + 4f(x) \\cdot \\frac{x^2 - f(x)}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{x^2 + f(x)}{2}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{x^2 + f(x)}{2}\\right) + 2f(x)(x^2 - f(x))\n\\]\n\n**Hmm...** Both sides have the same \\(f\\) term, which leads to:\n\n\\[\n2f(x)(x^2 - f(x)) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: This is a powerful simplification. It suggests that for each \\(x\\), either \\(f(x) = 0\\) or \\(f(x) = x^2\\).\n\n**Wait a minute...** This means that \\(f(x)\\) can take two distinct forms depending on \\(x\\). I initially missed this dual possibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Understanding the Implications**\n\nFrom the equation \\(2f(x)(x^2 - f(x)) = 0\\), we conclude:\n- Either \\(f(x) = 0\\)\n- Or \\(f(x) = x^2\\)\n\n**But actually...** This doesn't mean that \\(f(x)\\) is uniformly \\(0\\) or \\(x^2\\) for all \\(x\\). Instead, \\(f(x)\\) can vary: it's \\(0\\) for some \\(x\\) and \\(x^2\\) for others.\n\n**Hmm...** Let me double-check my reasoning here. Does this allow for mixed solutions where \\(f(x)\\) is \\(0\\) at some points and \\(x^2\\) at others? Yes, it does.\n\n**This reminds me of...** Piecewise functions or selective behaviors based on input values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Possible Solutions**\n\n**Case 1: \\(f(x) = 0\\) for all \\(x\\)**\n\n- This is a straightforward solution where \\(f(x)\\) is uniformly zero.\n- **Implication**: \\(f(3) = 0\\).\n\n**Case 2: \\(f(x) = x^2\\) for all \\(x\\)**\n\n- Let's verify if \\(f(x) = x^2\\) satisfies the original equation.\n\n**Verification**:\n- **LHS**: \\(f(f(x) + y) = f(x^2 + y)\\)\n- **RHS**: \\(f(x^2 - y) + 4f(x)y = f(x^2 - y) + 4x^2y\\)\n\nFor \\(f(x) = x^2\\):\n\n\\[\nf(x^2 + y) = (x^2 + y)^2\n\\]\n\\[\nf(x^2 - y) = (x^2 - y)^2\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + y)^2 \\stackrel{?}{=} (x^2 - y)^2 + 4x^2y\n\\]\n\nCalculating both sides:\n\n\\[\nLHS = x^4 + 2x^2y + y^2\n\\]\n\\[\nRHS = x^4 - 2x^2y + y^2 + 4x^2y = x^4 + 2x^2y + y^2\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion**: Both sides are equal, so \\(f(x) = x^2\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n**Wait, there's more...** This means \\(f(x)\\) can be either \\(0\\) or \\(x^2\\) depending on the input. Therefore, there are two distinct solutions that satisfy the functional equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Determining \\(f(3)\\)**\n\nGiven that \\(f(x)\\) can be either \\(0\\) or \\(x^2\\), let's consider how \\(f(3)\\) can manifest:\n\n1. **If \\(f(x) = 0\\) for all \\(x\\)**:\n   - \\(f(3) = 0\\)\n\n2. **If \\(f(x) = x^2\\) for all \\(x\\)**:\n   - \\(f(3) = 9\\)\n\n**But actually...** The functional equation allows for mixed solutions where \\(f(x)\\) is zero for some values and \\(x^2\\) for others. However, for the purpose of determining \\(f(3)\\), these two scenarios suffice.\n\n**Reflection**: Initially, I only considered the trivial solution \\(f(x) = 0\\), but now I see that \\(f(x) = x^2\\) is also a valid solution, leading to multiple possible values for \\(f(3)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating \\(n \\times s\\)**\n\n**Let me see...** We have two possible values for \\(f(3)\\):\n\n- \\(f(3) = 0\\) when \\(f(x) = 0\\) for all \\(x\\)\n- \\(f(3) = 9\\) when \\(f(x) = x^2\\) for all \\(x\\)\n\nTherefore:\n\n- **Number of possible values, \\(n = 2\\)**\n- **Sum of all possible values, \\(s = 0 + 9 = 9\\)**\n- **Compute \\(n \\times s = 2 \\times 9 = 18\\)**\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Recap and Reflection**\n\n- **Initial Approach**: I started with basic substitutions and assumed linearity, which led me to conclude that \\(f(x) = 0\\) was the only solution. This was an incomplete analysis.\n\n- **Correction**: By re-evaluating the functional equation and considering more insightful substitutions, I discovered that \\(f(x)\\) can also be \\(x^2\\), leading to multiple valid solutions.\n\n- **Final Conclusion**: There are two distinct solutions\u2014\\(f(x) = 0\\) and \\(f(x) = x^2\\)\u2014each yielding different values for \\(f(3)\\). Thus, \\(n \\times s = 18\\).\n\n**Takeaway**: It's essential to explore all possible forms that a function can take in a functional equation, especially when the problem hints at multiple solutions. Initial assumptions can sometimes limit the scope of the solution, so revisiting and reflecting on the approach is crucial for a complete and accurate solution.",

Suppose there exists a nonzero value $a$ such that $f(a) \\neq a^2.$  Then $f(a) = 0.$  Setting $x = 0$ in the given functional equation, we get\n\\[f(y) = f(-y).\\]In other words, $f$ is even.\n\nSetting $x = a$ in the given functional equation, we get\n\\[f(y) = f(a^2 - y).\\]Replacing $y$ with $-y,$ we get $f(-y) = f(a^2 + y).$  Hence,\n\\[f(y) = f(y + a^2)\\]for all values of $y.$\n\nSetting $y = a^2$ in the given functional equation, we get\n\\[f(f(x) + a^2) = f(x^2 - a^2) + 4a^2 f(x).\\]We know $f(f(x) + a^2) = f(f(x))$ and $f(x^2 - a^2) = f(x^2),$ so\n\\[f(f(x)) = f(x^2) + 4a^2 f(x). \\quad (*)\\]Setting $y = 0$ in the given functional equation, we get\n\\[f(f(x)) = f(x^2).\\]Comparing this equation to $(*),$ we see that $4a^2 f(x) = 0$ for all values of $x,$ which means $f(x) = 0$ for all $x.$  We see that this function satisfies the given functional equation.\n\nThus, there are two functions that work, namely $f(x) = 0$ and $f(x) = x^2.$  This means $n = 2$ and $s = 0 + 9 = 9,$ so $n \\times s = \\boxed{18}.$"
