    "working_out": "Alright, let's take another look at this problem. I know my initial approach had some errors, so I'll walk through it again, correcting my mistakes as I go. I'll keep my original insights in mind but be more careful with the details.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see this problem, I notice a **5 by 5 grid of points** with a larger square and a **shaded square** inside it. The goal is to find what fraction of the larger square's area is occupied by the shaded square.\n\n- **Brainstorming Ideas**:\n  - **Calculate the area** of both squares.\n  - Maybe the shaded square is **rotated**, which could affect how its area relates to the larger square.\n  - Possibly use **coordinate geometry** to find the lengths and areas.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Grid**\n\n- **Grid Details**:\n  - It's a **5 by 5 grid of points**, meaning there are **5 points along each side**.\n  - The larger square is drawn from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)`, so its **side length is 4 units**.\n\n- **Calculating the Area**:\n  - The area of the larger square is:\n    \\[\n    4 \\times 4 = 16 \\text{ square units}\n    \\]\n\n**Conclusion**: The **area of the larger square** is **16 square units**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing the Shaded Square**\n\n- **Coordinates Given**:\n  - The shaded square is drawn from points `(2,2)`, `(3,3)`, `(2,4)`, and `(1,3)`.\n\n- **Initial Observations**:\n  - These points suggest the shaded square is **rotated** within the larger square.\n  - It might be aligned **diagonally**, forming a **diamond shape**.\n\n- **Possible Approaches**:\n  - **Calculate the side length** of the shaded square.\n  - Use the **properties of squares** and **diagonals** to find the area.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Area of the Shaded Square**\n\n- **Idea**: Find the **side length** of the shaded square since it appears to be a square rotated at a 45-degree angle.\n\n- **Wait a Minute**:\n  - Initially, I thought of calculating the **diagonal**, but maybe I should focus on the **side length** first.\n\n- **Calculating the Side Length**:\n  - Look at the distance between two adjacent vertices, say from `(2,2)` to `(3,3)`:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Side length} = \\sqrt{(3-2)^2 + (3-2)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n    \\]\n  \n- **Realization**:\n  - **Oh!** This reminds me that the side length being \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) indicates that the square is oriented along the diagonals of the larger square.\n\n- **Calculating the Area**:\n  - The area of a square is the **side length squared**:\n    \\[\n    (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \\text{ square units}\n    \\]\n\n**Conclusion**: The **area of the shaded square** is **2 square units**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determining the Fraction**\n\n- **Calculating the Fraction**:\n  - Now, find the fraction of the larger square's area occupied by the shaded square:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{\\text{Area of Shaded Square}}{\\text{Area of Larger Square}} = \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{8}\n    \\]\n\n- **Reflection**:\n  - **Actually**, this makes sense because the shaded square is smaller and rotated within the larger square, covering **\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)** of its area.\n\n**Conclusion**: The **fraction of the larger square's area** that is inside the **shaded square** is **\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Summary**\n\n- **Mistakes and Corrections**:\n  - **Initially**, I miscalculated the area by incorrectly identifying the diagonal and overestimating the shaded square's area.\n  - By correctly calculating the **side length** and using it to find the area, I arrived at the correct fraction.\n\n- **Lessons Learned**:\n  - It's essential to **double-check the properties** of geometric shapes, especially when dealing with **rotated squares**.\n  - **Revisiting initial assumptions** can help catch errors early in the problem-solving process.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies Considered**:\n  - **Calculating the diagonal** initially seemed helpful, but focusing on the **side length** provided a more straightforward path.\n\n- **Verification**:\n  - By reassessing the side length and area calculations, I ensured that the final fraction accurately represented the shaded square's area relative to the larger square.\n\nBy carefully re-examining each step and correcting my initial missteps, I confidently determined that the shaded square occupies **\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)** of the larger square's area.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the side of the shaded square is a diagonal of the smaller squares, it has area $(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$ square units. The whole grid has area $4^2 = 16$ units, so the ratio of areas is $\\frac{2}{16} =\\boxed{\\frac 18}$."
