    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like how a human would approach it. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their effectiveness, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts:\n\n- **A cylindrical post with a circumference of 4 feet.**\n  - Okay, so the post is circular. Circumference might be important for unraveling the string.\n  \n- **String wraps around four full times from bottom to top.**\n  - Hmm, sounds like a spiral. Each loop covers part of the height.\n  \n- **Height of the post is 12 feet.**\n  - Total height is 12 feet, and the string finishes at the top after four loops.\n\n- **Find the length of the string.**\n  - Need to figure out how long the string is when wrapped in this spiral manner.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nThinking out loud:\n\n- **Unwrap the Cylinder Concept:**\n  - Maybe I can \"unwrap\" the cylindrical surface into a flat rectangle. The string would then form a straight line across this rectangle.\n  \n- **Using Pythagorean Theorem:**\n  - If unwrapped, each loop of the string might resemble the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Sounds familiar!\n\n- **Calculating Per Loop:**\n  - Perhaps calculate the length of the string for one loop and then multiply by four.\n\n- **Geometric Visualization:**\n  - Visualizing how the string wraps might help in understanding the path it takes.\n\nWhich strategy to try first?\n\n- **Unwrap the Cylinder Concept** seems promising. Let's start there.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Applying the Unwrap Strategy**\n\nLet me walk through this:\n\n- **Unwrapping the Cylinder:**\n  - If I unwrap the cylindrical surface, it'll form a rectangle.\n  - The **width** of this rectangle is the **circumference** of the cylinder: 4 feet.\n  - The **height** of the rectangle is the **height** of the cylinder: 12 feet.\n\n- **String's Path:**\n  - The string spirals up making four full loops.\n  - Each loop corresponds to moving from the bottom to the top over the height of 12 feet.\n\n- **Calculating the Total Horizontal Distance:**\n  - Since there are four loops, the string wraps around horizontally four times the circumference.\n  - Total horizontal distance = \\(4 \\times 4 \\text{ feet} = 16 \\text{ feet}\\).\n\nWait, let's pause and reflect:\n\n- **Does this make sense?**\n  - Yes, the string makes four complete horizontal loops, so covering 16 feet horizontally seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Visualizing the Path as a Diagonal**\n\nContinuing from the unwrap idea:\n\n- **Diagonal of the Rectangle:**\n  - The string forms a straight line (diagonal) from one corner of the rectangle to the opposite corner.\n\n- **Right Triangle Concept:**\n  - This diagonal can be seen as the hypotenuse of a right triangle.\n  - The legs of the triangle are:\n    - **Horizontal leg:** Total horizontal distance = 16 feet\n    - **Vertical leg:** Height of the post = 12 feet\n\nInitial Reaction:\n\n- **This definitely feels like a Pythagorean Theorem moment.**\n  - I can use \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) to find the length of the hypotenuse (the string).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Calculating the Length Using Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nAlright, let's do the math:\n\n- **Assign Variables:**\n  - \\(a = 16\\) feet (horizontal distance)\n  - \\(b = 12\\) feet (vertical distance)\n  - \\(c = ?\\) (the length of the string)\n\n- **Applying the Theorem:**\n  \\[\n  c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{16^2 + 12^2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculating:**\n  \\[\n  16^2 = 256\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  12^2 = 144\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  256 + 144 = 400\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  c = \\sqrt{400} = 20 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n\nReflection:\n\n- **Does this result make sense?**\n  - A length of 20 feet seems reasonable given the dimensions.\n  - The hypotenuse being longer than either leg aligns with Pythagorean principles.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Verifying the Approach**\n\nBut wait, it's always good to double-check:\n\n- **Alternative Check:**\n  - **Calculate Per Loop:**\n    - Length of the string per loop using a smaller triangle:\n      - **Horizontal per loop:** Circumference = 4 feet\n      - **Vertical per loop:** Total height / 4 loops = 12 feet / 4 = 3 feet\n      \n    - **Using Pythagorean Theorem per loop:**\n      \\[\n      c_{\\text{per loop}} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\text{ feet}\n      \\]\n      \n    - **Total Length:**\n      \\[\n      5 \\text{ feet per loop} \\times 4 \\text{ loops} = 20 \\text{ feet}\n      \\]\n      \n- **Consistency:**\n  - Both methods lead to the same result: **20 feet**.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\n- **The approach is solid.**\n  - Unwrapping the cylinder simplifies the problem.\n  - Using the Pythagorean Theorem accurately calculates the string's length.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming, applying the unwrap strategy, and verifying through an alternative check, the length of the string is **20 feet**.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20 \\text{ feet}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThat wraps it up! By exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the results, we've confidently arrived at the correct answer.",

  "ground_truth": "Each time the string spirals around the post, it travels 3 feet up and 4 feet around the post.  If we were to unroll this path, it would look like: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,3)--(4,3)--(4,0)--cycle, linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(4,3),linewidth(.7));\nlabel(\"3\",(0,1.5),W);\nlabel(\"4\",(2,3),N);\n[/asy] Clearly, a 3-4-5 right triangle has been formed.  For each time around the post, the string has length 5.  So, the total length of the string will be $4\\cdot 5=\\boxed{20}$ feet."
