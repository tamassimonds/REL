    "working_out": "### **Initial Brainstorming**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We're dealing with the greatest integer function, \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\), which is essentially the floor function\u2014rounding down to the nearest integer. The equation given is:\n\n\\[\nx - \\lfloor x \\rfloor = \\frac{1}{\\lfloor x \\rfloor}\n\\]\n\nAt first glance, this equation involves both \\(x\\) and its floor, which makes it kind of tricky. The left side, \\(x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor\\), is just the fractional part of \\(x\\), denoted as \\(\\{x\\}\\). So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\{x\\} = \\frac{1}{\\lfloor x \\rfloor}\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to find the sum of the three smallest positive solutions for \\(x\\). I think the key here is to explore different values of \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) since it's an integer, and see how \\(x\\) and its fractional part behave.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Fix \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) and Solve for \\(x\\):** Since \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) is an integer, I can start by assigning different positive integer values to it and see if the equation holds.\n\n2. **Check for Validity:** For each value of \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = n\\), I'll check if \\(\\{x\\} = \\frac{1}{n}\\) results in a valid \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Sum the Smallest Solutions:** Once I identify the smallest positive \\(x\\) values, I'll sum them up to get the final answer.\n\nLet's proceed with the first strategy.\n\n### **Step 1: Assign \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 1\\)**\n\n- **Set \\(n = 1\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  \\{x\\} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1\n  \\]\n\n- **Interpretation:**\n\n  \\(\\{x\\} = 1\\) means the fractional part of \\(x\\) is 1. But wait\u2014can the fractional part be 1? Normally, \\(\\{x\\}\\) should be in the range \\([0, 1)\\). This feels off.\n\n- **Reflection:**\n\n  Alright, this doesn't work because the fractional part exceeds its maximum value. So, \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 1\\) doesn't yield a valid solution.\n\n**Conclusion:** No solution for \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 1\\).\n\n### **Step 2: Assign \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2\\)**\n\n- **Set \\(n = 2\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  \\{x\\} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\n  \\]\n\n- **Compute \\(x\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  x = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{x\\} = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5\n  \\]\n\n- **Validity Check:**\n\n  \\(\\lfloor 2.5 \\rfloor = 2\\) and \\(\\{2.5\\} = 0.5\\), which satisfies the equation.\n\n- **Reflection:**\n\n  This works perfectly! We've found our first valid solution.\n\n**First Solution:** \\(x_1 = 2.5\\)\n\n### **Step 3: Assign \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 3\\)**\n\n- **Set \\(n = 3\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  \\{x\\} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333\n  \\]\n\n- **Compute \\(x\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  x = 3 + 0.333 \\approx 3.333\n  \\]\n\n- **Validity Check:**\n\n  \\(\\lfloor 3.333 \\rfloor = 3\\) and \\(\\{3.333\\} \\approx 0.333\\), which satisfies the equation.\n\n- **Reflection:**\n\n  This is another valid solution.\n\n**Second Solution:** \\(x_2 \\approx 3.333\\)\n\n### **Step 4: Assign \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 4\\)**\n\n- **Set \\(n = 4\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  \\{x\\} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\n  \\]\n\n- **Compute \\(x\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  x = 4 + 0.25 = 4.25\n  \\]\n\n- **Validity Check:**\n\n  \\(\\lfloor 4.25 \\rfloor = 4\\) and \\(\\{4.25\\} = 0.25\\), which satisfies the equation.\n\n- **Reflection:**\n\n  Yet another valid solution. We've now found three solutions.\n\n**Third Solution:** \\(x_3 = 4.25\\)\n\n### **Reviewing the Solutions So Far**\n\n- **Solutions Identified:**\n\n  - \\(x_1 = 2.5\\)\n  - \\(x_2 \\approx 3.333\\)\n  - \\(x_3 = 4.25\\)\n\n- **Sum:**\n\n  \\[\n  S = 2.5 + 3.333 + 4.25 = 10.083\n  \\]\n\n- **Express as Mixed Number:**\n\n  To express \\(10.083\\) as a mixed number:\n\n  \\[\n  10.083 = 10 + \\frac{1}{12}\n  \\]\n\n  Because \\(0.083 \\times 12 \\approx 1\\).\n\n- **Reflection:**\n\n  Wait, let's double-check this. The decimal approximation might be slightly off. Instead of approximating, let's convert each fractional part accurately.\n\n### **Post-Check Adjustments**\n\n- **Exact Solutions:**\n\n  - \\(x_1 = 2.5 = 2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n  - \\(x_2 = 3 + \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n  - \\(x_3 = 4 + \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\n- **Adding Fractions Precisely:**\n\n  \\[\n  S = \\left(2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(3 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) + \\left(4 + \\frac{1}{4}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  S = (2 + 3 + 4) + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} \\right)\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  S = 9 + \\left(\\frac{6}{12} + \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  S = 9 + \\frac{13}{12} = 9 + 1 + \\frac{1}{12} = 10 + \\frac{1}{12}\n  \\]\n\n- **Final Answer:**\n\n  \\[\n  S = 10\\frac{1}{12}\n  \\]\n\n### **Reassessing the Approach**\n\n- **Validity of Solutions:**\n\n  Each assigned \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) (starting from 2) provides a valid \\(x\\) that satisfies the original equation.\n\n- **Did I Miss Any Smaller Solutions?**\n\n  Since \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 1\\) didn't yield a valid solution, starting from \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2\\) is correct.\n\n- **Is the Sum Correct?**\n\n  By breaking down the fractional parts and summing them accurately, the final mixed number makes sense.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different integer values for \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) and verifying each solution:\n\n- The **three smallest positive solutions** are:\n  - \\(x_1 = 2.5\\)\n  - \\(x_2 = 3\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n  - \\(x_3 = 4.25\\)\n\n- **Sum of Solutions:**\n  \n  \\[\n  S = 10\\frac{1}{12}\n  \\]\n\n**",
