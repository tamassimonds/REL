    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work often, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let's see where this takes us!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem:\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This seems like a population growth problem, specifically exponential growth. I remember dealing with something similar before where a quantity doubles at regular intervals.\n\n- **Details That Stand Out:** \n  - The bacteria population starts at 20.\n  - It doubles every 3 minutes.\n  - We need to find the population at 3:15 PM, starting from 3:00 PM.\n\n- **Time Interval:** So, we're looking at a total of 15 minutes from 3:00 PM to 3:15 PM. That\u2019s five 3-minute intervals.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:** \n  - **Exponential Growth Formula:** Use the mathematical formula for exponential growth.\n  - **Simple Doubling Approach:** Calculate the population step by step by doubling it every 3 minutes.\n  - **Use of a Table or List:** Create a table to track the population at each interval.\n  - **Graphical Representation:** Although not necessary here, maybe sketching a graph could help visualize the growth.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** I'm leaning towards the **Simple Doubling Approach** because it's straightforward and aligns well with the given information. The Exponential Growth Formula could work too, but it feels a bit more abstract for this specific case. Using a table might be redundant since we only need to calculate a few steps.\n\n### **Exploring the Simple Doubling Approach**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the **Simple Doubling Approach**:\n\n- **Step 1:** Calculate the population after the first 3 minutes.\n  \nWait, let me think... If I double 20, I get 40. That seems right.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  20 \\times 2 = 40\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Okay, doubling 20 gives me 40. That feels correct because each bacteria reproduces, leading to a population twice as large.\n\n- **Step 2:** Calculate the population after another 3 minutes (total 6 minutes).\n\nHmm, so I need to double 40 now.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  40 \\times 2 = 80\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** Doubling 40 gives 80. That seems logical.\n\n- **Step 3:** Continue this process for another 3 minutes (total 9 minutes).\n\nLet me double 80.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  80 \\times 2 = 160\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Doubling 80 to get 160 checks out.\n\n- **Step 4:** Another 3 minutes (total 12 minutes).\n\nDoubling 160...\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  160 \\times 2 = 320\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** This seems right.\n\n- **Step 5:** Final 3 minutes (total 15 minutes).\n\nLast doubling from 320...\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  320 \\times 2 = 640\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** So after 15 minutes, the population is 640. That sounds reasonable given the exponential growth.\n\n### **Quick Check of the Calculation**\n\nBefore finalizing, let\u2019s check if this makes sense:\n\n- **Does 640 seem too big?** Let\u2019s see... Starting from 20 and doubling five times:\n  - 20 \u2192 40 \u2192 80 \u2192 160 \u2192 320 \u2192 640\n  - Each step makes sense; the numbers are doubling as expected.\n\n- **Alternative Approach Check:** Would using the Exponential Growth Formula give a different result? Let's quickly recall the formula:\n  \\[\n  P = P_0 \\times 2^{(t/T)}\n  \\]\n  Where:\n  - \\( P_0 = 20 \\) (initial population)\n  - \\( t = 15 \\) minutes (total time)\n  - \\( T = 3 \\) minutes (doubling time)\n  \n  Plugging in:\n  \\[\n  P = 20 \\times 2^{(15/3)} = 20 \\times 2^5 = 20 \\times 32 = 640\n  \\]\n  \n- **Final Reflection:** Both methods agree on the final population being 640. This consistency adds confidence that the calculation is correct.\n\n### **Considering an Alternative Method: Using a Table**\n\nWait, maybe creating a table could help visualize the growth better. Let me try that:\n\n| Time (minutes) | Population |\n|----------------|------------|\n| 0              | 20         |\n| 3              | 40         |\n| 6              | 80         |\n| 9              | 160        |\n| 12             | 320        |\n| 15             | 640        |\n\n- **Reflection on the Table:** The table clearly shows the population doubling at each 3-minute interval. It aligns with our previous calculations.\n\n- **Check:** Does the table confirm the final answer? Yes, it does. The population at 15 minutes is still 640.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies:\n\n- The **Simple Doubling Approach** provided a straightforward path to the solution.\n- The **Exponential Growth Formula** confirmed the result and acted as a check.\n- **Creating a Table** helped visualize the growth and verify each step.\n\nThroughout the process, checking each calculation and reflecting on whether the numbers make sense ensured accuracy. **Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{640}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Was I on the Right Track?** Yes, starting with the Simple Doubling Approach worked well.\n- **Did Checking My Work Help?** Absolutely! It confirmed that each step was correct and aligned with expectations.\n- **Would Another Method Have Been Better?** The Exponential Growth Formula served as a good check, but for this simple case, the doubling approach was sufficient.\n  \n**Conclusion:** By brainstorming different strategies, selecting the most straightforward one, and continually checking my work, I arrived confidently at the solution: **640 bacteria present at 3:15 PM.**\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough captures the natural thinking process, including brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed.

  "ground_truth": "There are five 3-minute increments between 3:00 pm and 3:15 pm, so the bacteria doubles 5 times, so the final population is $2^5 = 32$ times the initial population.  Hence at 3:15 pm there are $20 \\cdot 32 = \\boxed{640}$ bacteria."
