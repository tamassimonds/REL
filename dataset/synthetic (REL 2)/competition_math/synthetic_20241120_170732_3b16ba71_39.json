    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether each approach makes sense, and pivot as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, my mind immediately recalls probability concepts, especially those involving multiple-choice questions and guessing. It reminds me of problems where you deal with success and failure outcomes, kind of like the binomial probability scenarios I've encountered before.\n\nBut then I think, \"Wait, William is guessing the last four questions out of 25. The rest of the questions might affect the overall probability, but since he's guessing, maybe I can treat each of the last four questions independently.\"\n\nI'm not entirely sure where to start, but the notion of independent probability events pops up. Maybe I could calculate the probability of getting at least one right among the four by considering the complementary probability\u2014getting none right.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Complementary Probability Method:**  \n   - Calculate the probability of getting all four questions wrong and subtract that from 1.\n\n2. **Binomial Probability Calculation:**  \n   - Since each question has multiple choices, perhaps a binomial probability approach could work by calculating the probability of getting exactly one, two, three, or all four questions right.\n\n3. **Simulation Approach:**  \n   - Though less practical here, simulating multiple guessing scenarios might give an intuitive sense of the probability.\n\nHmm, the complementary probability method seems straightforward and is often used for \"at least one\" type problems. The binomial probability method could also work but might complicate things unnecessarily since I'm only interested in at least one correct answer.\n\nLet me start with the **complementary probability method**, as it seems the most direct. If that doesn't pan out, I'll reconsider.\n\n### **Step 1: Defining the Complementary Probability**\n\nAlright, let's define the events:\n\n- **Success:** William gets at least one of the last four questions right.\n- **Failure:** William gets all four of the last questions wrong.\n\nIt makes sense to calculate the probability of **all four being wrong** and then subtract that from 1 to find the probability of at least one being right.\n\nBut wait, before proceeding, I should ensure this approach is valid. Since each question has five answer choices and William is guessing, the probability of getting a question wrong seems crucial here.\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because if I can find the probability of getting all four wrong, subtracting that from 1 gives me the probability of getting at least one right. It's a logical approach for \"at least one\" scenarios.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Probability of Getting All Four Questions Wrong**\n\nNow, to find the probability of getting all four questions wrong, I need to consider the probability of getting a single question wrong.\n\n- There are **five answer choices** per question.\n- Assuming only **one correct answer** out of the five, the probability of guessing incorrectly on a single question is:\n\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{wrong}) = \\frac{4}{5}\n  \\]\n\nDoes that probability seem correct? Yes, because if you have one correct answer, there are four incorrect options.\n\nWait, let me think about it. If he guesses randomly, and there's only one correct option out of five, then four out of five chances are wrong. That checks out.\n\nBut let's double-check. If `P(correct) = 1/5`, then `P(wrong) = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5`. Yes, it's correct.\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Probability to All Four Questions**\n\nSince the guessing is independent for each question, the probability of getting all four wrong is the product of the probabilities of getting each one wrong.\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{all four wrong}) = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, time to calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{256}{625}\n\\]\n\nDoes that number seem reasonable? Let me think. \n\n256 and 625 both seem like perfect powers (16 and 25), so the fraction simplifies accurately. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Probability of Getting At Least One Right**\n\nNow, to find the probability of getting at least one question right, subtract the probability of getting all four wrong from 1:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least one right}) = 1 - P(\\text{all four wrong}) = 1 - \\frac{256}{625}\n\\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{256}{625} = \\frac{625 - 256}{625} = \\frac{369}{625}\n\\]\n\nHmm, let's simplify this fraction if possible.\n\nWait, let me check if 369 and 625 have any common factors. The numerator 369 is divisible by 3:\n\n\\[\n369 \\div 3 = 123\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, 625 is divisible by 25:\n\n\\[\n625 \\div 25 = 25\n\\]\n\nBut can 123 and 25 be simplified further? No, 123 = 3 \u00d7 41 and 25 = 5 \u00d7 5, so they have no common factors.\n\nThus, the fraction simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{369}{625}\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nIs this the final answer? The fraction \\(\\frac{369}{625}\\) seems correct since both numerator and denominator are reduced to their simplest form. Let's quickly check if this probability makes sense.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{369}{625} \\approx 0.5904\n\\]\n\nA probability around 0.59 feels reasonable, considering there's a good chance William might get at least one question right by guessing.\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\nBefore wrapping up, let's verify the correctness of the approach:\n\n- **Independent Events:** Correctly assumed that each question's answer is independent.\n- **Complementary Probability:** Using the complementary probability is a standard method for \"at least one\" problems.\n- **Calculations:** The arithmetic checks out, and the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\nEverything seems aligned, and the probability calculated is plausible.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThe strategy worked well\u2014starting with the complementary probability method was effective. Initially, I considered the binomial probability approach, but realizing the complementary method's straightforwardness helped streamline the solution.\n\nThroughout the process, checking each step ensured accuracy, and reflecting on the probability values confirmed their reasonableness.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWilliam's probability of getting at least one of the last four questions right is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with constant reflection and checking, led to a clear and correct solution.",
