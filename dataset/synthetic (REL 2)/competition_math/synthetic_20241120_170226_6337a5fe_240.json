    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it just as I would if I were solving it myself\u2014brainstorming different strategies, checking if each step makes sense, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let's see where this journey takes us!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first look at the system of equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nxy &= 6 - 2x - 3y, \\\\\nyz &= 6 - 4y - 2z, \\\\\nxz &= 30 - 4x - 3z,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nI notice that each equation involves products of two variables equaling a linear combination of the others. This reminds me of problems involving **factoring**, **substitution**, or perhaps **setting up a system to simplify multiple equations simultaneously**.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  - **Rearrange each equation:** Bring all terms to one side to set each equation to zero.\n  - **Substitute variables:** Try expressing one variable in terms of the others to reduce the system.\n  - **Factor out common terms:** See if factoring can simplify the equations.\n\nI lean towards **rearranging** the equations first to see a clearer path. If that doesn't work, I'll consider substitutions or factoring next.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Rearranging the Equations**\n\nLet's take each equation and bring all terms to one side:\n\n1. \\( xy + 2x + 3y - 6 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( yz + 4y + 2z - 6 = 0 \\)\n3. \\( xz + 4x + 3z - 30 = 0 \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, each equation is set to zero, which makes it easier to see potential factoring or substitution opportunities. Maybe I can identify patterns or common factors among the equations.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this help? Not immediately clear, but at least they're organized uniformly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBringing all terms to one side is a good starting point. But now, I need to think about the next step. Factoring seems tricky here since there aren't obvious common factors across all terms. Maybe substitution could work, but that might get messy with three variables.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWait, factoring might not be the most straightforward way here. Perhaps looking for a substitution that relates the equations could be better. But before jumping into substitutions, let's think about another approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Substitution**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nMaybe I can express one variable in terms of the others from one equation and substitute it into the others to reduce the system.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nLet's take the first equation:\n\n\\[ xy + 2x + 3y - 6 = 0 \\]\n\nPerhaps I can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( z \\). But looking at the structure, \\( y \\) is tied to both \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) in different equations, making it complicated.\n\n**Check:**\n\nHmm, this substitution idea isn't straightforward because \\( y \\) appears in all three equations, and each equation involves different combinations of \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\). It might lead to a convoluted system.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis doesn't seem like the right path. Substitutions would likely complicate things further, especially with three variables. I need a simpler approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSubstitution isn't working well here. Maybe there's a more direct method, like leveraging the relationships between the equations without substituting variables.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Looking for a Common Factor or Pattern**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nPerhaps there's a common factor or pattern I can exploit across the equations. Maybe multiplying or adding equations could reveal something.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nLet me rewrite the equations to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. \\( xy + 2x + 3y = 6 \\)\n2. \\( yz + 4y + 2z = 6 \\)\n3. \\( xz + 4x + 3z = 30 \\)\n\nNotice that the right-hand side of the first two equations is 6, while the third is 30. This is a clue that perhaps multiplying the first two equations could relate to the third.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet's try multiplying the first two equations to see what happens:\n\n\\[\n(xy + 2x + 3y)(yz + 4y + 2z) = 6 \\times 6\n\\]\n\nBut wait, multiplying these out looks messy and might not lead anywhere simple.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis doesn't seem promising. The multiplication is complex and might not lead to a straightforward solution. Perhaps there's a better way to relate the equations without such heavy operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMultiplying the equations isn't practical. I need to find a more straightforward way to connect them.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring a Different Approach\u2014Setting Up Linear Relationships**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nInstead of trying to multiply or factor, maybe I can set up linear relationships based on the products and see if there's a way to solve for one variable directly.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nLet's look at the first equation:\n\n\\[ xy = 6 - 2x - 3y \\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n\\[ xy + 2x + 3y = 6 \\]\n\nNow, suppose I treat this as a linear equation in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Similarly, apply this idea to the other equations.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Treating each equation as a linear combination could allow me to set up a system that can be solved using matrices or substitution without complicating things too much.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI think this approach might work. By treating each equation as a linear relationship, I can attempt to solve them simultaneously without getting bogged down in substitutions or multiplications.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSetting up linear relationships seems promising. Let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Implementing the Linear Relationships Approach**\n\n**Action:**\n\nLet's take the first equation and solve for \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( z \\).\n\n\\[\nxy = 6 - 2x - 3y \\implies y(x + 3) = 6 - 2x \\implies y = \\frac{6 - 2x}{x + 3}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I have an expression for \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\). I can substitute this into the other equations to see if it helps reduce the system.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this substitution simplify the other equations? Let's try it with the second equation.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nSubstitute \\( y = \\frac{6 - 2x}{x + 3} \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\nyz = 6 - 4y - 2z\n\\]\n\nBut wait, since \\( y \\) is already in terms of \\( x \\), maybe substituting back into the second equation isn't the best idea. Instead, perhaps I should look for another relationship that directly connects \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis substitution seems to complicate things. Maybe I need to backtrack and try another strategy that connects all three variables more directly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSubstituting \\( y \\) into the second equation doesn't simplify the system. Therefore, perhaps I need to find a relationship between the equations that allows me to solve for \\( x \\) directly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Re-examining the System for Patterns**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nLet me look for patterns or possible factorizations that can relate the equations without complicating substitutions.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nRewriting the equations:\n\n1. \\( xy + 2x + 3y = 6 \\)\n2. \\( yz + 4y + 2z = 6 \\)\n3. \\( xz + 4x + 3z = 30 \\)\n\nNotice that the first two equations have the same right-hand side (6). Perhaps I can set them equal to each other because they both equal 6.\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, setting them equal doesn't directly help since each equation involves different variables. However, perhaps there's a way to combine them.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis isn't leading anywhere directly. Maybe there's a different path.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSetting the first two equations equal doesn't simplify the problem. Therefore, I need another approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Leveraging the Third Equation's Unique Right-Hand Side**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nThe third equation has a different right-hand side (30) compared to the first two (6). Perhaps I can use this to find a relationship between the variables.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the third:\n\n\\[\n(xz + 4x + 3z) - (xy + 2x + 3y) = 30 - 6\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nxz + 4x + 3z - xy - 2x - 3y = 24 \\implies xz - xy + 2x + 3z - 3y = 24\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this help? Not immediately clear, but perhaps I can factor or rearrange terms to isolate \\( x \\) or \\( z \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis simplification doesn't directly isolate \\( x \\) or \\( z \\). Perhaps I need to combine this with another equation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis doesn't seem to lead directly to \\( x \\), so perhaps I should look for another relationship or combination that isolates \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Exploring More Combinations\u2014Subtracting the Second from the Third**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nLet's see what happens if I subtract the second equation from the third.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\n\\[\n(xz + 4x + 3z) - (yz + 4y + 2z) = 30 - 6\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nxz + 4x + 3z - yz - 4y - 2z = 24 \\implies xz - yz + 4x - 4y + z = 24\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nHmm, now we have \\( xz - yz + 4x - 4y + z = 24 \\). This still doesn't directly isolate \\( x \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis combination doesn't simplify the problem enough to solve for \\( x \\) directly. However, maybe if I factor the left-hand side, it could lead somewhere.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFactoring might be challenging here. Still, perhaps I can identify patterns or relationships that can lead to a solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Looking for Factorization Opportunities**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nPerhaps I can factor the third equation to relate it to the first two.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nLet's see if the third equation can be factored in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( z \\):\n\n\\[\nxz + 4x + 3z = 30\n\\]\n\nBut wait, factoring this directly in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) doesn't seem straightforward.\n\n**Check:**\n\nIs there a common factor or pattern? Not immediately clear.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFactoring the third equation doesn't seem practical. Maybe I need to rethink this strategy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFactoring isn't helping. I need a different approach to connect the equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Considering Ratio Relationships**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nPerhaps there's a ratio relationship between the variables that can be derived from the equations.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nLet's look at the first two equations:\n\n1. \\( xy = 6 - 2x - 3y \\)\n2. \\( yz = 6 - 4y - 2z \\)\n\nMaybe I can divide one by the other to see a proportional relationship.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDividing equation 1 by equation 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{xy}{yz} = \\frac{6 - 2x - 3y}{6 - 4y - 2z} \\implies \\frac{x}{z} = \\frac{6 - 2x - 3y}{6 - 4y - 2z}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis gives a ratio between \\( x \\) and \\( z \\), which might be useful. However, it still involves multiple variables, making it complex.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile this ratio might help, it still involves multiple variables and doesn't directly isolate \\( x \\). Perhaps I need to find another relationship.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 11: Simplifying the System by Setting Products Equal**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nI recall that sometimes setting two equations equal can simplify the system. Let's see if this works here.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nSet the first two equations equal to each other since both equal 6:\n\n\\[\nxy + 2x + 3y = yz + 4y + 2z\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nxy + 2x + 3y - yz - 4y - 2z = 0 \\implies xy - yz + 2x - 2z + 3y - 4y = 0 \\implies (x - z)y + 2(x - z) = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring:\n\n\\[\n(x - z)(y + 2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis implies either \\( x = z \\) or \\( y + 2 = 0 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, would \\( y + 2 = 0 \\) lead to a valid solution? If \\( y = -2 \\), substituting back might complicate things. Perhaps it's better to consider the case where \\( x = z \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSetting \\( x = z \\) seems more promising. Let's proceed with this assumption and see if it leads to a consistent solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 12: Assuming \\( x = z \\) and Simplifying the System**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nAssume \\( x = z \\) and see if the system simplifies accordingly.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nSubstituting \\( x = z \\) into the original equations:\n\n1. \\( xy = 6 - 2x - 3y \\)\n2. \\( yz = 6 - 4y - 2z \\) becomes \\( yx = 6 - 4y - 2x \\) (since \\( x = z \\))\n3. \\( xz = 30 - 4x - 3z \\) becomes \\( x^2 = 30 - 4x - 3x = 30 - 7x \\)\n\n**Check:**\n\nNow we have:\n\n1. \\( xy = 6 - 2x - 3y \\)\n2. \\( yx = 6 - 4y - 2x \\)\n3. \\( x^2 = 30 - 7x \\)\n\nWait, equation 1 and equation 2 are identical if \\( x = z \\), so we only need to solve two equations.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis simplification is helpful. Let's proceed to solve the system with the assumption \\( x = z \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAssuming \\( x = z \\) reduces the system, making it easier to solve. Let's move forward with solving these equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 13: Solving the Simplified System**\n\n**Action:**\n\nWe have:\n\n1. \\( xy = 6 - 2x - 3y \\)\n2. \\( x^2 = 30 - 7x \\)\n\nLet's solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFrom equation 2, we can solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 7x - 30 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in \\( x \\). We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 120}}{2} = \\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{169}}{2} = \\frac{-7 \\pm 13}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-7 + 13}{2} = 3 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{-7 - 13}{2} = -10\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWe need the positive solution for \\( x \\), so:\n\n\\[\nx = 3\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x = z \\), \\( z = 3 \\) as well.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems correct. Now, let's check if these values satisfy the first equation to ensure consistency.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAssuming \\( x = z \\) led us to \\( x = 3 \\), which is the positive solution we need. Let's verify this by substituting back into the original equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 14: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Action:**\n\nLet's substitute \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( z = 3 \\) back into the original equations to ensure consistency.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\n\\[\nxy = 6 - 2(3) - 3y \\implies 3y = 6 - 6 - 3y \\implies 3y + 3y = 0 \\implies 6y = 0 \\implies y = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( y = 0 \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( y = 0 \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\nyz = 6 - 4(0) - 2(3) \\implies 0 = 6 - 0 - 6 \\implies 0 = 0\n\\]\n\nCheck the third equation:\n\n\\[\nx z = 30 - 4(3) - 3(3) \\implies 3 \\times 3 = 30 - 12 - 9 \\implies 9 = 9\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nAll equations are satisfied with \\( x = 3 \\), \\( y = 0 \\), and \\( z = 3 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe solution is consistent across all equations. Therefore, \\( x = 3 \\) is indeed the correct positive solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nVerifying the solution confirms that assuming \\( x = z \\) was a valid step, leading to the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Brainstorming:** Started by brainstorming different strategies\u2014rearranging, substitution, and factoring.\n   \n2. **Rearranging Equations:** Brought all terms to one side, making the system uniform.\n\n3. **Exploring Substitution:** Attempted to express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( z \\), but it complicated the system.\n\n4. **Looking for Patterns:** Searched for common factors and attempted to set equations equal, leading to \\( x = z \\).\n\n5. **Assuming \\( x = z \\):** Simplified the system by assuming \\( x = z \\), reducing the number of equations.\n\n6. **Solving the System:** Solved the simplified system, finding \\( x = 3 \\) as the positive solution.\n\n7. **Verifying the Solution:** Substituted back into the original equations to ensure consistency, confirming \\( x = 3 \\) is correct.\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected on each step, checking if the approach was leading towards a solution and adjusting strategies as needed. This iterative checking ensured that the final answer was accurate.",
