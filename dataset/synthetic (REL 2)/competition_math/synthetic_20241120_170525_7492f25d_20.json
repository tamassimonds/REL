    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, reflecting and brainstorming as we go along. The goal here is to find an expression for the area of triangle \\( COB \\) in terms of \\( p \\), where \\( C(0, p) \\) lies on the \\( y \\)-axis between \\( O(0, 0) \\) and \\( Q(0, 12) \\).\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, I see a triangle on the coordinate plane, with points on the \\( x \\)- and \\( y \\)-axes. The point \\( C \\) is somewhere on the \\( y \\)-axis between \\( O \\) and \\( Q \\). \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Understanding the Triangle:** I recall that the area of a triangle can typically be found using the base and height. Here, the base and height seem to align with the \\( x \\)- and \\( y \\)-axes, respectively.\n\n- **Coordinate Geometry Approach:** Since all points are given as coordinates, maybe using the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at specific coordinates could work.\n\n- **Determinant Method:** I remember that the area can be calculated using the determinant of a matrix formed by the coordinates of the vertices.\n\n- **Alternative Methods:** Perhaps using vectors or coordinates to find lengths and then applying the base-height formula might be another route.\n\nAt this stage, I'm leaning towards using the determinant method because it directly uses the coordinates and seems straightforward for finding the area of a triangle in the coordinate plane.\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying the Coordinates**\n\nLet's list the coordinates of the points involved:\n\n- \\( O(0, 0) \\)\n- \\( C(0, p) \\), where \\( 0 < p < 12 \\)\n- \\( B(12, 0) \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks good. Knowing \\( p \\) is between 0 and 12 helps establish the position of \\( C \\) on the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Determinant Method**\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of triangle \\( COB \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\nwhere the points are:\n\n- \\( O(0, 0) \\)\n- \\( C(0, p) \\)\n- \\( B(12, 0) \\)\n\n**Plugging in the Coordinates:**\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0(p - 0) + 0(0 - 0) + 12(0 - p) \\right|\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 + 0 - 12p \\right|\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12p = 6p\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, this seems straightforward, but let me double-check. The determinant method should account for the orientation of the triangle, and here, since \\( p \\) is positive, the area calculation makes sense. \n\nWait, let me consider if there's an easier way or if this feels right.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying with Base and Height Concept**\n\nTo ensure correctness, let's think about the triangle's base and height.\n\n- **Base \\( OB \\):** The length between \\( O(0, 0) \\) and \\( B(12, 0) \\) is 12 units.\n  \n- **Height:** The point \\( C(0, p) \\) is at a height \\( p \\) units from the \\( x \\)-axis.\n\n**Calculating Area Using Base and Height:**\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 \\times p = 6p\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: \\( 6p \\). This consistency reinforces that the approach is correct. \n\n### **Step 4: Final Check**\n\nLet me think about the constraints given in the problem:\n\n- \\( C \\) is on the \\( y \\)-axis between \\( O(0, 0) \\) and \\( Q(0, 12) \\), meaning \\( 0 < p < 12 \\).\n  \n- This ensures that the triangle \\( COB \\) always has a positive area since \\( p \\) is positive.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The area expression \\( 6p \\) makes sense given the positions of the points and the constraints provided.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying calculations, the expression for the area of triangle \\( COB \\) in terms of \\( p \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6p}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with continuous reflection and verification, ensures that the solution is accurate and reliable.",
