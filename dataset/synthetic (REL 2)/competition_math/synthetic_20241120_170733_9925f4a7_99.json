    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by exploring different strategies and reflecting on each step to ensure I'm on the right track. If something doesn't seem right, I'll rethink and adjust my approach accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, **\"Suppose that \\( y^3 \\) varies inversely with \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\),\"** it reminds me of inverse variation concepts I've encountered before. Inverse variation usually means that one variable increases as another decreases, which often involves multiplying the variables to maintain a constant.\n\nBut then I think, **\"Wait, there\u2019s a cube involved here, both in \\( y^3 \\) and \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\). That\u2019s different from the usual \\( y \\) and \\( z \\) inverse relationships I\u2019m familiar with.\"** Confusion sets in about how exactly the variables relate when one is cubed and the other is under a cube root.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Express Inverse Variation Mathematically:**\n   - Typically, if \\( y^3 \\) varies inversely with \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\), I would think of setting up an equation involving a constant.\n\n2. **Use Given Values to Determine the Constant:**\n   - I know \\( y = 2 \\) when \\( z = 1 \\). This seems like a good point to find that constant.\n\n3. **Solve for \\( z \\) When \\( y = 4 \\):**\n   - Once the constant is determined, I can set up the equation for \\( y = 4 \\) to find the corresponding \\( z \\).\n\n### **Step 1: Express Inverse Variation Mathematically**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGiven that \\( y^3 \\) varies inversely with \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\), I recall that inverse variation can often be expressed as:\n\n\\[\ny^3 \\times \\sqrt[3]{z} = k\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant. But this feels a bit off because typically, in inverse variation, the product is constant, not involving roots in both variables. \n\n**Realization:**\n\n**\"Hmm, this doesn\u2019t look like the standard form because usually it's just \\( y \\) and \\( z \\). Maybe I need to rethink how \\( y^3 \\) and \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\) are related.\"**\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Rewriting the Inverse Relationship**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nPerhaps I can relate \\( y^3 \\) and \\( z \\) more directly. If \\( y^3 \\) varies inversely with \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\), maybe I can express it as:\n\n\\[\ny^3 = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt[3]{z}}\n\\]\n\nThis seems more aligned with how inverse variation is typically set up.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI'll go with this formulation: **\\( y^3 = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt[3]{z}} \\)**\n\n**Check:**\n\n**\"Does this make sense? Inverse variation implies that as \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\) increases, \\( y^3 \\) decreases, which is consistent with the formulation.\"** \n\n### **Step 2: Use Given Values to Determine the Constant \\( k \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI have the values \\( y = 2 \\) and \\( z = 1 \\). Plugging these into the equation should help me find \\( k \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(2)^3 = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt[3]{1}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n8 = \\frac{k}{1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk = 8\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n**\"Calculating \\( k \\) worked out neatly. \\( y^3 = 8 \\) when \\( z = 1 \\) matches the given condition.\"** \n\n### **Step 3: Set Up the Equation for \\( y = 4 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I know \\( k = 8 \\), I can set up the equation to find \\( z \\) when \\( y = 4 \\).\n\n**Equation:**\n\n\\[\n(4)^3 = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt[3]{z}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n64 = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt[3]{z}}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n**\"This seems correct. We're solving for \\( z \\) when \\( y = 4 \\).\"** \n\n### **Step 4: Solve for \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\)**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} \\):\n\n\\[\n64 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{z} = 8\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 64:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{z} = \\frac{8}{64} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n**\"This simplifies nicely. \\( \\sqrt[3]{z} = \\frac{1}{8} \\) makes sense.\"** \n\n### **Step 5: Solve for \\( z \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find \\( z \\), I need to cube both sides since \\( z \\) is under a cube root.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nz = \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{512}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n**\"Cubing \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) gives \\( \\frac{1}{512} \\), which seems reasonable.\"** \n\n### **Reflection: Was This the Right Approach?**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLooking back, starting with the inverse variation equation \\( y^3 = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt[3]{z}} \\) aligned well with the problem's wording. Using the given values to find \\( k \\) was straightforward, and solving for \\( z \\) when \\( y = 4 \\) followed logically.\n\n**Check:**\n\n**\"Does \\( z = \\frac{1}{512} \\) make sense in the context? Let me quickly verify by plugging back into the original equation.\"**\n\n### **Quick Verification:**\n\nPlugging \\( z = \\frac{1}{512} \\) and \\( y = 4 \\) back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n(4)^3 = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{512}}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n64 = \\frac{8}{\\frac{1}{8}} = 64\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n**\"The equation holds true, so \\( z = \\frac{1}{512} \\) is correct.\"** \n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{1}{512}\n\\]\n\n**Summary:**\n\nBy expressing the inverse variation correctly and using the given values to find the constant, I was able to determine that \\( z = \\frac{1}{512} \\) when \\( y = 4 \\). Checking each step ensured the approach was valid, and a quick verification confirmed the final result.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step approach, complete with brainstorming, reflections, and checks, was helpful in solving the problem!",
