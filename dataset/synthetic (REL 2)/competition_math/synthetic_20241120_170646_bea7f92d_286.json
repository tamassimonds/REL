I'll take my time to brainstorm, explore different strategies, make reflections, and check my work throughout to ensure I'm on the right track. I'll write out my thought process just as I would if I were solving this problem manually, complete with initial thoughts, uncertainties, and \"aha moments.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nWhen I first see the equation \\( |3x + 7| = 26 \\), my immediate reaction is to recall what absolute value means. Absolute value represents the distance from zero on the number line, so \\( |3x + 7| = 26 \\) tells me that \\( 3x + 7 \\) is either 26 or -26.\n\n**Possible Approaches:**\n1. **Split into Two Equations:** Since absolute value can be positive or negative, I could set up two separate equations: \\( 3x + 7 = 26 \\) and \\( 3x + 7 = -26 \\).\n   \n2. **Graphical Method:** Another approach could be to visualize the equation graphically, but that might be more time-consuming and isn't necessary for a straightforward algebraic problem.\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** I could try manipulating the equation differently, but given the simplicity of absolute value equations, splitting it into two seems the most direct.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe first strategy\u2014splitting into two equations\u2014makes the most sense to me. It's straightforward and aligns with how absolute value equations are typically solved.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the First Equation**\n\n**Applying the First Approach:**\nLet's set up the two cases based on the definition of absolute value.\n\n**Case 1:**\n\\[ 3x + 7 = 26 \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThis is a simple linear equation. I just need to isolate \\( x \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n3x + 7 = 26 \\\\\n3x = 26 - 7 \\\\\n3x = 19 \\\\\nx = \\frac{19}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, I got \\( x = \\frac{19}{3} \\) from the first case. That seems reasonable. Let's check if this solution satisfies the original equation.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\\[\n3\\left(\\frac{19}{3}\\right) + 7 = 19 + 7 = 26 \\\\\n|26| = 26 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n\\]\nSo, \\( x = \\frac{19}{3} \\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Second Equation**\n\n**Case 2:**\n\\[ 3x + 7 = -26 \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\nAgain, this is a linear equation. I'll isolate \\( x \\) just like before.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n3x + 7 = -26 \\\\\n3x = -26 - 7 \\\\\n3x = -33 \\\\\nx = \\frac{-33}{3} \\\\\nx = -11\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nI've found another solution: \\( x = -11 \\). Let me quickly verify if this satisfies the original equation.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\\[\n3(-11) + 7 = -33 + 7 = -26 \\\\\n|-26| = 26 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n\\]\nSo, \\( x = -11 \\) is also a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Multiple Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I've found two solutions\u2014\\( x = \\frac{19}{3} \\) and \\( x = -11 \\)\u2014I realize that absolute value equations typically have two solutions: one positive and one negative. This aligns with what I've found.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis makes sense because absolute value equations reflect both ends of the number line. It's reassuring to see that both solutions satisfy the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe problem asks for the **smallest** value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the equation. Between \\( x = \\frac{19}{3} \\) and \\( x = -11 \\), the smallest value is \\( x = -11 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe smallest solution is:\n\\[\nx = -11\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Solutions**\n\n**Multiple Checks:**\n1. **Substitution:** I substituted both \\( x = \\frac{19}{3} \\) and \\( x = -11 \\) back into the original equation, and both satisfied it.\n\n2. **Absolute Value Definition:** I recalled that absolute value equations always yield two solutions, one positive and one negative. This pattern emerged in my solutions.\n\n3. **Graphical Insight:** Although I didn't graph the equation, if I were to plot \\( |3x + 7| = 26 \\), the intersections with the line \\( y = 26 \\) and \\( y = -26 \\) would correspond to my two solutions.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. Both solutions are correct, and the smallest value is \\( x = -11 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe smallest value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the equation \\( |3x + 7| = 26 \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-11}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nBy brainstorming different strategies, I chose to split the absolute value equation into two linear equations. After solving both, I verified each solution's validity by substituting back into the original equation. Multiple reflections and checks ensured the correctness of the solutions, leading to the final answer of \\( x = -11 \\) as the smallest solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We can split the expression $|3x+7|=26$ into two separate cases: $3x+7=26$ and $3x+7=-26$. For the first case, solving for $x$ would give us $x=\\frac{26-7}{3}=\\frac{19}{3}$. For the second case, we would get $x=\\frac{-26-7}{3}=\\frac{-33}{3}=-11$. Therefore, $x=\\frac{19}{3}$ and $x=-11$ both satisfy the equation. Since the problem asks for the smallest value of $x$, our solution is $\\boxed{-11}$."
