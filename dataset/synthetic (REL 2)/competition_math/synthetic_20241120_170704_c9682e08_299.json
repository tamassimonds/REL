    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process step by step, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work often, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like tackling a problem naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, my initial reaction is:\n\n- **\"Three six-sided dice? I remember rolling dice problems often deal with probabilities of sums.\"**\n- **\"But a sum of 18? Wait, that\u2019s the maximum possible sum when all dice show 6.\"** \n- **\"Hmm, so we're looking at the probability of all three dice landing on 6.\"**\n\nThis makes me think that maybe it's a straightforward case where all dice need to show their highest value. But let's explore to ensure this is the correct path.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **List All Possible Outcomes:**\n   - I could calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three dice.\n   \n2. **Determine Favorable Outcomes:**\n   - Then, identify how many of those outcomes result in a sum of 18.\n\n3. **Calculate Probability:**\n   - Probability = Number of Favorable Outcomes / Total Possible Outcomes.\n\n4. **Check if There's a Quicker Way:**\n   - Considering the maximum sum is 18, maybe focusing directly on all dice showing 6 is more efficient.\n\nI'm leaning towards strategy 4\u2014focusing on all dice showing 6\u2014because it seems the most direct. But I'll explore the first three strategies to confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Listing All Possible Outcomes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **\"Each die has 6 faces, and they are rolled independently.\"**\n- **\"So, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6.\"**\n- **\"Let me calculate that.\"**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **\"Okay, there are 216 total possible outcomes. That seems right.\"**\n- **\"But since we're looking for a specific case where the sum is 18, maybe there's a more efficient way.\"**\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **\"Wait, if all dice need to show 6 to sum to 18, does it make sense to calculate all possible outcomes?\"**\n- **\"Hmm, perhaps there's a quicker path by considering only the case where all dice show 6.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Focusing on Favorable Outcomes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **\"For the sum to be 18, each die must show 6.\"**\n- **\"So there's only one specific outcome: (6, 6, 6).\"**\n- **\"That means there's only 1 favorable outcome.\"**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **\"This simplifies things a lot.\"**\n- **\"There's only one way to get a sum of 18\u2014by rolling sixes on all dice.\"**\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **\"Does this make sense? Yes, because any other combination would result in a sum less than 18.\"**\n- **\"So, I have 1 favorable outcome.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **\"Probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total possible outcomes.\"**\n- **\"So, it's 1 favorable outcome out of 216 total outcomes.\"**\n- **\"Let me write that as a fraction.\"**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{216}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **\"This fraction makes sense because it's a rare event\u2014only one specific combination out of 216.\"**\n- **\"I feel confident that the probability is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{216}\\).\"**\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **\"Quick check: Does \\(\\frac{1}{216}\\) seem reasonable? Yes, it's a small probability, which fits since rolling three sixes is uncommon.\"**\n- **\"Is there any part of the process that feels off? No, everything aligns.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **\"Let's make sure the strategy was correct from the start.\"**\n- **\"Initially, I considered listing all outcomes but realized focusing on the specific favorable outcome was more efficient.\"**\n- **\"Did exploring multiple strategies help confirm the correctness? Yes, it guided me to the most direct path.\"**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **\"By considering both general and specific cases, I ensured the approach was robust.\"**\n- **\"I avoided unnecessary calculations by zeroing in on the single favorable outcome.\"**\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **\"Does the final probability \\(\\frac{1}{216}\\) match the logic? Absolutely.\"**\n- **\"Is there anything else to explore? No, I believe the problem is thoroughly addressed.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming and exploring different strategies, I confirmed that the probability of rolling three six-sided dice and getting a sum of 18 is \\(\\frac{1}{216}\\). By focusing directly on the only favorable outcome\u2014each die showing a 6\u2014I arrived at the solution efficiently.\n\nThroughout the process, checking and reflecting ensured the approach was correct and that the final answer was reasonable. This step-by-step exploration mirrors natural problem-solving, allowing for adjustments and confirmations along the way.",
