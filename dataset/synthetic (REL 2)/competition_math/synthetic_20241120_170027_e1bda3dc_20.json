    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process, brainstorming strategies, reflecting on each step, and making sure to check if my approach is correct before moving forward.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**User Query:**  \nWhat is the value of \\( x \\) in the equation \\( 9^4 + 9^4 + 9^4 = 3^x \\)?\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nHmm, I see an equation involving exponents. My first thought is that this reminds me of properties of exponents and perhaps simplifying both sides to compare the bases. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure if that\u2019s the best way to start. Maybe I should brainstorm a bit more.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n1. **Simplify the Left Side:**  \n   - Combine the \\( 9^4 \\) terms. There are three of them, so maybe addition rules apply.\n\n2. **Express \\( 9 \\) in Terms of \\( 3 \\):**  \n   - I recall that \\( 9 \\) is \\( 3^2 \\). Maybe rewriting \\( 9^4 \\) in terms of \\( 3 \\) would help.\n\n3. **Check if Both Sides Can Be Expressed with the Same Base:**  \n   - If both sides are powers of the same base, it might be easier to equate the exponents.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThinking about it, expressing everything in terms of base \\( 3 \\) seems promising because it might make the exponents easier to work with. Let\u2019s go with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Express \\( 9 \\) in Terms of \\( 3 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince \\( 9 = 3^2 \\), replacing \\( 9 \\) with \\( 3^2 \\) might simplify things. This way, both sides of the equation could possibly have the same base.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n9^4 = (3^2)^4\n\\]\n\n**Applying Exponent Rule:**  \n\\[\n(3^2)^4 = 3^{2 \\times 4} = 3^8\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, that makes sense. By exponent properties, raising a power to a power multiplies the exponents. So, \\( 9^4 \\) becomes \\( 3^8 \\).\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes \\( (3^2)^4 \\) really equal \\( 3^8 \\)?  \n- \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\), so \\( (3^2)^4 = 3^8 \\).  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Rewrite the Left Side of the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I know \\( 9^4 = 3^8 \\), replacing \\( 9^4 \\) in the equation should help simplify the left side. But there are three \\( 9^4 \\) terms added together, so I need to consider how to handle that.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n9^4 + 9^4 + 9^4 = 3^8 + 3^8 + 3^8\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**  \nThis is just adding three identical terms:\n\\[\n3^8 + 3^8 + 3^8 = 3 \\times 3^8\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, is that correct?  \nAdding three \\( 3^8 \\) is the same as multiplying \\( 3^8 \\) by 3. That seems logical.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes \\( 3^8 + 3^8 + 3^8 \\) really equal \\( 3 \\times 3^8 \\)?  \n- \\( 3 \\times 3^8 = 3^1 \\times 3^8 = 3^{1+8} = 3^9 \\).  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Write the Equation with the Same Base**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, the equation is simplified to:\n\\[\n3^9 = 3^x\n\\]\nSince both sides have the same base, I can equate the exponents directly.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\nx = 9\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat was straightforward once both sides had the same base. Equating the exponents is a solid strategy here.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes \\( 3^9 = 3^9 \\)?  \n- Absolutely. Both sides are equal.  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Double-Check the Work**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIt\u2019s always good to verify if each step makes sense, especially when dealing with exponents. Let\u2019s go back and ensure everything aligns correctly.\n\n**Checking Step 1:**  \n- Replacing \\( 9 \\) with \\( 3^2 \\) and computing \\( (3^2)^4 = 3^8 \\):  \n  - **Correct.**\n\n**Checking Step 2:**  \n- Adding three \\( 3^8 \\) together to get \\( 3^9 \\):  \n  - **Correct.** Multiplication of exponents checks out.\n\n**Checking Step 3:**  \n- Equating exponents \\( x = 9 \\):  \n  - **Correct.** Both sides are clearly equal.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The steps logically follow one another, and the final answer makes sense.\n\n**Final Check:**  \n- Does \\( 9^4 + 9^4 + 9^4 \\) really equal \\( 3^9 \\)?  \n  - \\( 9^4 = 6561 \\), so \\( 3 \\times 6561 = 19683 \\).  \n  - \\( 3^9 = 19683 \\).  \n  - **Verdict:** Both sides are equal, confirming the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\nx = 9\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, I realized that expressing \\( 9 \\) in terms of \\( 3 \\) was key to simplifying the equation. After rewriting and simplifying each step, checking along the way ensured accuracy. Ultimately, equating the exponents led directly to the solution: \\( x = 9 \\).\n\nReflecting throughout helped catch any potential missteps early, making the process smoother and more reliable.",
