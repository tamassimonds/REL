The question is:\n\n**If** \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\), **then what is** \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\)?\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this equation, **\\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\)**, I recall that there\u2019s a relationship between sine and cosine functions, especially within the unit circle. This reminds me of the Pythagorean identity:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\n\\]\n\nI also think about **trigonometric identities** like the tangent function, which might relate sine and cosine. Alternatively, I could explore using **phasing transformations** or perhaps even **solving for specific angle values**.\n\nHowever, I'm reflecting that multiplying both sides by \\(\\cos x\\) might lead me somewhere useful. But, I\u2019m also considering that maybe setting up a tangent ratio could simplify things. Let me brainstorm a bit more.\n\n- **Option 1:** Use the Pythagorean identity to relate sine and cosine.\n- **Option 2:** Divide both sides by \\(\\cos x\\) to express in terms of tangent.\n- **Option 3:** Solve for \\(x\\) using basic trigonometric equations and then find \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\).\n\nThinking about it, **Option 1** seems promising because it directly relates sine and cosine. **Option 2** might lead to finding \\(\\tan x\\), which could be useful but may complicate things. **Option 3** feels like it might require solving for specific angles, which could be time-consuming and unnecessary.\n\nI'll start with **Option 1**\u2014using the Pythagorean identity\u2014and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Express \\(\\sin x\\) in Terms of \\(\\cos x\\)**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\n\\]\n\nThis immediately connects sine and cosine. To use the Pythagorean identity, I need both \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\). So, let's express \\(\\sin x\\) in terms of \\(\\cos x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This gives me a direct relationship between \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\), which is great because I can substitute this into the Pythagorean identity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substitute into the Pythagorean Identity**\n\nThe Pythagorean identity is:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\) into this equation:\n\n\\[\n(3 \\cos x)^2 + \\cos^2 x = 1\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n9 \\cos^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n10 \\cos^2 x = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, that simplifies nicely! I can solve for \\(\\cos x\\) from here. It seems like the right path because it directly leads to finding \\(\\cos x\\), which is what I need.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solve for \\(\\cos x\\)**\n\nFrom:\n\n\\[\n10 \\cos^2 x = 1\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 10:\n\n\\[\n\\cos^2 x = \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n\\[\n\\cos x = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** I get two possible values for \\(\\cos x\\): positive and negative. Since cosine is positive in the first and fourth quadrants, I\u2019ll consider both cases depending on the angle \\(x\\). However, without more context (like the specific range of \\(x\\)), both could be valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determine \\(\\sin x\\) Using \\(\\cos x\\)**\n\nNow, using \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin x = 3 \\left(\\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}\\right) = \\pm \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{10}} = \\pm \\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Again, \\(\\sin x\\) can be positive or negative depending on the sign of \\(\\cos x\\). This makes sense because sine and cosine are related by their signs in different quadrants.\n\n---\n\n### **Check-In: Does This Make Sense?**\n\nBefore proceeding, let\u2019s quickly verify:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = \\left(\\pm \\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{10}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{10}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{9 \\times 10}{100}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{10}{100}\\right) = \\frac{90}{100} + \\frac{10}{100} = \\frac{100}{100} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Yes, it satisfies the Pythagorean identity, so the values are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Find \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\)**\n\nNow, we need to calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\sin x \\cos x\n\\]\n\nUsing the identity:\n\n\\[\n\\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin(2x)\n\\]\n\nBut since we don\u2019t have \\(x\\), let's see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, recall that:\n\n\\[\n\\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{1}{2} (\\sin x + \\sin x)\n\\]\n\nOops! That doesn\u2019t help. Let\u2019s try multiplying \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) directly.\n\nUsing:\n\n\\[\n\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\sin x \\cos x = (3 \\cos x) \\cos x = 3 \\cos^2 x\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\cos^2 x = \\frac{1}{10}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin x \\cos x = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This seems straightforward. By expressing \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\) in terms of \\(\\cos^2 x\\), I avoided dealing with \\(\\sin(2x)\\) directly. It looks correct because it\u2019s consistent with the identity and the values calculated.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Is This Approach Correct?**\n\nAfter breaking down the problem:\n\n- **Substituted** \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\) into the Pythagorean identity.\n- **Solved** for \\(\\cos x\\) and subsequently \\(\\sin x\\).\n- **Determined** \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\) by relating it to \\(\\cos^2 x\\).\n\nEverything checks out, and the calculations are consistent with trigonometric identities. The value **\\(\\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{3}{10}\\)** makes sense given the relationship between sine and cosine in this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approaches and Reflection**\n\n- **Attempting to Use the Identity \\(\\sin(2x) = 2 \\sin x \\cos x\\):** Initially considered using this to find \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\) directly, but since we don't have \\(x\\), it led back to needing \\(\\cos^2 x\\).\n\n- **Solving for Specific Angle Values:** Another approach could have been finding specific angles where \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\), but that would involve solving a quadratic equation and wasn't necessary here.\n\n- **Dividing Both Sides by \\(\\cos x\\):** Thought about expressing in terms of \\(\\tan x\\), but it seemed unnecessary and added complexity.\n\n**Reflection:** The path taken was the most straightforward, leveraging the Pythagorean identity and direct substitution. Checking along the way ensured correctness, and alternative methods confirmed that this approach was efficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically applying trigonometric identities and verifying each step, we determined that:\n\n\\[\n\\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\nThis solution aligns with the given equation and satisfies the fundamental trigonometric identity, ensuring its validity.",
