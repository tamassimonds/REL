Here's how I would approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is asking to find an integer \\( n \\) within the range \\( -90 < n < 90 \\) such that \\( \\tan n^\\circ = \\tan 1000^\\circ \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Trigonometric Properties:** Immediately, I think about properties of the tangent function. I remember that tangent is periodic, meaning it repeats its values after a certain interval.\n- **Periodic Function:** I recall that the period of the tangent function is \\( 180^\\circ \\). This might be useful for reducing \\( 1000^\\circ \\) to an equivalent angle within the desired range.\n- **Modular Arithmetic:** This reminds me of modular arithmetic, where we can reduce angles by multiples of \\( 180^\\circ \\) to find an equivalent angle in one period.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Use the Periodicity of Tangent:** Reduce \\( 1000^\\circ \\) by subtracting \\( 180^\\circ \\) multiples until it's within \\( -90^\\circ \\) to \\( 90^\\circ \\).\n  2. **Check Multiple Angles:** Since tangent is periodic, potentially multiple values could satisfy the equation, but only one will be within the given range.\n  3. **Alternative Approaches:** Perhaps using the cotangent or recognizing angle patterns, but I'm not sure if those are necessary here.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems like a straightforward application of the periodicity of the tangent function. Let's start with that and see where it leads. If it doesn't work, we can explore other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Periodicity of Tangent**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since \\( \\tan \\theta \\) has a period of \\( 180^\\circ \\), this means \\( \\tan \\theta = \\tan (\\theta + 180^\\circ) = \\tan (\\theta + 360^\\circ) \\), and so on.\n- Therefore, to find an angle equivalent to \\( 1000^\\circ \\) within the standard range of the tangent function, I can subtract \\( 180^\\circ \\) repeatedly until the angle falls within \\( -90^\\circ \\) to \\( 90^\\circ \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **First Reduction:**\n  \\[\n  1000^\\circ - 180^\\circ = 820^\\circ\n  \\]\n- **Second Reduction:**\n  \\[\n  820^\\circ - 180^\\circ = 640^\\circ\n  \\]\n- **Third Reduction:**\n  \\[\n  640^\\circ - 180^\\circ = 460^\\circ\n  \\]\n- **Fourth Reduction:**\n  \\[\n  460^\\circ - 180^\\circ = 280^\\circ\n  \\]\n- **Fifth Reduction:**\n  \\[\n  280^\\circ - 180^\\circ = 100^\\circ\n  \\]\n  \n**Check:**  \nWait, \\( 100^\\circ \\) is outside our desired range \\( (-90^\\circ, 90^\\circ) \\). Since \\( \\tan \\) is periodic with \\( 180^\\circ \\), I need to go one more step to find an equivalent angle within the given range.\n\n**Additional Reduction:**\n\\[\n100^\\circ - 180^\\circ = -80^\\circ\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nNow, \\( -80^\\circ \\) is within the range \\( -90 < n < 90 \\). This suggests that \\( n = -80 \\) might be the correct answer. But let's double-check to ensure this approach is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To confirm that \\( n = -80^\\circ \\) is indeed the correct solution, I should verify that \\( \\tan (-80^\\circ) = \\tan (1000^\\circ) \\).\n- Since we've reduced \\( 1000^\\circ \\) to \\( -80^\\circ \\), they should be equal if our calculations are correct.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Calculating \\( \\tan(-80^\\circ) \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\tan(-80^\\circ) = -\\tan(80^\\circ) \\quad \\text{(because } \\tan(-\\theta) = -\\tan(\\theta)\\text{)}\n  \\]\n- **Calculating \\( \\tan(1000^\\circ) \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\tan(1000^\\circ) = \\tan(-80^\\circ) \\quad \\text{(as we've reduced it)}\n  \\]\n  \n**Check:**  \nSo, \\( \\tan(-80^\\circ) = -\\tan(80^\\circ) \\) and \\( \\tan(1000^\\circ) = -\\tan(80^\\circ) \\). Thus, \\( \\tan(-80^\\circ) = \\tan(1000^\\circ) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis verifies that our approach is correct, and \\( n = -80 \\) is indeed the solution. However, to be thorough, let's consider if there could be other solutions within the given range or if any alternative methods could have been applied.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Multiple Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- While we've found \\( n = -80^\\circ \\) as a solution, I recall that trigonometric equations can sometimes have multiple solutions within a given range due to the periodic nature of the function.\n- However, since the range specified is \\( -90 < n < 90 \\) and tangent has a period of \\( 180^\\circ \\), any angle outside this range would not be considered. Therefore, \\( n = -80 \\) is the only solution within the specified range.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n- **Using Cotangent:** Perhaps considering \\( \\cot n^\\circ = \\cot 1000^\\circ \\) could provide insights, but since cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent and doesn't directly relate in this context, it's not necessary here.\n- **Graphical Method:** Visualizing the tangent function would show that multiple angles have the same tangent value, but only one falls within \\( -90^\\circ \\) to \\( 90^\\circ \\) in this case.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGiven the periodicity of the tangent function and the specified range, \\( n = -80^\\circ \\) is the unique solution. No further solutions exist within \\( -90 < n < 90 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- It\u2019s important to ensure that all calculations and logical steps align with the properties of the tangent function.\n- Revisiting the initial steps to confirm that reducing \\( 1000^\\circ \\) by \\( 180^\\circ \\) multiples correctly leads to \\( -80^\\circ \\).\n\n**Check:**  \n- **Reduction Verification:**\n  \\[\n  1000^\\circ - 180^\\circ \\times 5 = 1000^\\circ - 900^\\circ = 100^\\circ\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  100^\\circ - 180^\\circ = -80^\\circ\n  \\]\n  \n- **Range Confirmation:**  \n  \\( -80^\\circ \\) fits within \\( -90 < n < 90 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The approach was correct from the start, and no alternative methods were necessary beyond applying the periodicity of the tangent function.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy applying the periodicity of the tangent function and systematically reducing \\( 1000^\\circ \\) to find an equivalent angle within the specified range, we've determined that the integer \\( n \\) satisfying \\( \\tan n^\\circ = \\tan 1000^\\circ \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-80}\n\\]\n\nThroughout the process, reflecting on each step ensured the correctness of the approach, and considering multiple strategies confirmed that our initial method was the most straightforward and effective.",
