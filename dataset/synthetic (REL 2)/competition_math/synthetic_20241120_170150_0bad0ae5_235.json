    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem. I\u2019ll brainstorm a bit to figure out how to approach it, and I'll make sure to reflect and check my work as I go along.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{x - 1}{2x}}\n\\]\n\nI need to express \\(\\tan \\theta\\) in terms of \\(x\\). \n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Half-Angle Identity:** This reminds me of the half-angle identities in trigonometry. I know that relates \\(\\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\) to \\(\\tan \\theta\\). Maybe I can use that.\n  \n- **Pythagorean Identities:** Another angle could be to relate sine and cosine through the Pythagorean identities.\n\n- **Algebraic Manipulation:** Perhaps I can manipulate the given equation to find \\(\\theta\\) and then calculate \\(\\tan \\theta\\).\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use Half-Angle Identity:**\n   - There's an identity relating \\(\\tan \\theta\\) and \\(\\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\). Maybe I can plug in the given value directly.\n\n2. **Express \\(\\theta\\) in Terms of \\(x\\):**\n   - Try to solve for \\(\\theta\\) using inverse trigonometric functions and then find \\(\\tan \\theta\\).\n\n3. **Pythagorean Relationships:**\n   - Relate \\(\\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\) to \\(\\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\) and then use the double angle formulas.\n\n**Checking Feasibility:**\n\n- The **half-angle identity** seems most straightforward since it directly relates \\(\\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\) to \\(\\tan \\theta\\).\n  \n- **Expressing \\(\\theta\\) in terms of \\(x\\)** feels more complicated and might lead to more equations than necessary.\n\n- **Pythagorean relationships** could work too, but again, might be overcomplicating things.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI think starting with the **half-angle identity** is the best approach. If that doesn't work out, I can explore the other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Half-Angle Identity**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I remember that there's a half-angle identity for sine:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\cos \\theta}{2}}\n  \\]\n\n- Given \\(\\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{x - 1}{2x}}\\), I can set these equal to each other:\n\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\cos \\theta}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{x - 1}{2x}}\n  \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Square Both Sides:** To eliminate the square roots:\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1 - \\cos \\theta}{2} = \\frac{x - 1}{2x}\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplify:** Since both sides are divided by 2, multiply both sides by 2 to simplify:\n\n  \\[\n  1 - \\cos \\theta = \\frac{x - 1}{x}\n  \\]\n\n- **Rearrange to Solve for \\(\\cos \\theta\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  \\cos \\theta = 1 - \\frac{x - 1}{x} = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** I\u2019ve expressed \\(\\cos \\theta\\) in terms of \\(x\\). This feels like progress. But I need to check if \\(\\cos \\theta = \\frac{1}{x}\\) is reasonable given that \\(\\theta\\) is acute (i.e., \\(0 < \\theta < 90^\\circ\\) or \\(0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\)).\n\n- **For Acute Angles:** Since \\(x > 1\\) (because \\(\\cos \\theta\\) must be between 0 and 1 for acute angles), this seems valid.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) Fit?** If \\(x > 1\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{x} < 1\\), which is acceptable for \\(\\cos \\theta\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Relating \\(\\tan \\theta\\) to \\(\\cos \\theta\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have \\(\\cos \\theta = \\frac{1}{x}\\), I need to find \\(\\tan \\theta\\).\n\n- I recall the identity:\n\n  \\[\n  \\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}\n  \\]\n\n- But I don\u2019t have \\(\\sin \\theta\\) yet. Maybe I can find \\(\\sin \\theta\\) using the Pythagorean identity:\n\n  \\[\n  \\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1\n  \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Substitute \\(\\cos \\theta\\) into Pythagorean Identity:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\sin^2 \\theta + \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2 = 1\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  \\sin^2 \\theta + \\frac{1}{x^2} = 1\n  \\]\n\n- **Solve for \\(\\sin^2 \\theta\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  \\sin^2 \\theta = 1 - \\frac{1}{x^2} = \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Take the Square Root to Find \\(\\sin \\theta\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  \\sin \\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{x}\n  \\]\n\n  (Since \\(\\theta\\) is acute, \\(\\sin \\theta\\) is positive.)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is This Correct?** I\u2019ve found \\(\\sin \\theta\\) in terms of \\(x\\). It seems logical because \\(\\sin \\theta\\) should be positive and less than or equal to 1 for acute angles.\n\n- **Check the Range:** Given \\(x > 1\\), \\(\\sqrt{x^2 - 1} < x\\), so \\(\\sin \\theta < 1\\), which is good.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does the Equation Hold?** Let's verify if \\(\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1\\):\n\n  \\[\n  \\sin^2 \\theta = \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2}, \\quad \\cos^2 \\theta = \\frac{1}{x^2}\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  \\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2} + \\frac{1}{x^2} = \\frac{x^2 - 1 + 1}{x^2} = \\frac{x^2}{x^2} = 1\n  \\]\n\n- **Conclusion:** The identity holds true, so \\(\\sin \\theta\\) and \\(\\cos \\theta\\) are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\(\\tan \\theta\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have both \\(\\sin \\theta\\) and \\(\\cos \\theta\\), I can find \\(\\tan \\theta\\):\n\n  \\[\n  \\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}\n  \\]\n\n- Substitute the expressions I found:\n\n  \\[\n  \\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{x}}{\\frac{1}{x}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{1} = \\sqrt{x^2 - 1}\n  \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\tan \\theta = \\sqrt{x^2 - 1}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Final Expression:** \\(\\tan \\theta = \\sqrt{x^2 - 1}\\)\n\n- **Does It Make Sense?** Given that \\(x > 1\\), \\(\\sqrt{x^2 - 1}\\) is positive and makes sense for \\(\\tan \\theta\\) in an acute angle.\n\n- **Quick Check:** If \\(x = 2\\), then \\(\\tan \\theta = \\sqrt{2^2 - 1} = \\sqrt{3}\\), which is a reasonable value for an acute angle.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Consistency with Trigonometric Identities:** \n\n  \\[\n  \\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{x}}{\\frac{1}{x}} = \\sqrt{x^2 - 1}\n  \\]\n\n- **Verification:** Everything checks out. The identities hold, and the values are within the expected ranges for an acute angle.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\tan \\theta = \\sqrt{x^2 - 1}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Starting with the half-angle identity was a good choice. It directly linked the given information to what I needed to find.\n\n- **Steps Consistency:** Each step built logically on the previous one, ensuring that the relationships between sine, cosine, and tangent were correctly applied.\n\n- **Variable Ranges:** Keeping track of the conditions (e.g., \\(x > 1\\)) helped verify that the solutions were valid for acute angles.\n\n- **Checkpoints:** Regular checks confirmed that the calculations were correct and that the identities held true throughout the process.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy carefully applying trigonometric identities and verifying each step, I've successfully expressed \\(\\tan \\theta\\) in terms of \\(x\\). This method not only provided the correct solution but also ensured that each part of the process was logically sound and consistent.",
