    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether each approach is correct, check my work frequently, and adjust my methods as needed. Let's start by understanding the question thoroughly.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \\(8^{4x - 6} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x + 5}\\), my initial reaction is that it involves exponents on both sides. Exponential equations often benefit from expressing both sides with the same base. However, I'm not sure if that's the only way to approach it. \n\nI remember properties of exponents, like how to handle bases that are reciprocals or powers of each other. But I also recall that sometimes logarithms can be helpful for solving equations where exponents are involved. \n\nLet me brainstorm a bit:\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Try to express both sides with the same base.\n- **Strategy 2:** Apply logarithms to both sides to bring down the exponents.\n- **Strategy 3:** Simplify the exponents step by step without changing the base.\n\nI think starting with the first strategy makes sense because it's often the most straightforward. If that doesn't work or gets too complicated, I can switch to using logarithms. Let's try that first.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Expressing Both Sides with the Same Base**\n\nI know that \\(8\\) can be expressed as a power of \\(2\\):\n\\[\n8 = 2^3\n\\]\nSo, the left side becomes:\n\\[\n8^{4x - 6} = (2^3)^{4x - 6}\n\\]\nUsing the power of a power property (\\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\)), this simplifies to:\n\\[\n(2^3)^{4x - 6} = 2^{3(4x - 6)} = 2^{12x - 18}\n\\]\nNow, the equation is:\n\\[\n2^{12x - 18} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x + 5}\n\\]\nBut wait, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) can also be expressed as \\(2^{-1}\\), so the right side becomes:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x + 5} = (2^{-1})^{x + 5} = 2^{-(x + 5)} = 2^{-x - 5}\n\\]\nNow the equation is:\n\\[\n2^{12x - 18} = 2^{-x - 5}\n\\]\nThis looks much cleaner! Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this approach make sense? Yes, since both sides are powers of \\(2\\), equating the exponents is valid. Let's move on to the next step.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Equating the Exponents**\n\nNow that the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\\[\n12x - 18 = -x - 5\n\\]\nThis is a straightforward linear equation. Let's solve for \\(x\\).\n\n**Checking if the Approach is Correct:**\n\nWait, does it make sense to just solve this linear equation directly? Yes, because we've correctly transformed the original exponential equation into a linear one by equating the exponents.\n\n**Step 3: Solving the Linear Equation**\n\nAdd \\(x\\) to both sides to eliminate the \\(x\\) term on the right:\n\\[\n12x + x - 18 = -x + x - 5 \\\\\n13x - 18 = -5\n\\]\nNext, add \\(18\\) to both sides:\n\\[\n13x - 18 + 18 = -5 + 18 \\\\\n13x = 13\n\\]\nFinally, divide both sides by \\(13\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{13}{13} \\\\\nx = 1\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, \\(x = 1\\). This seems reasonable, but let's double-check by plugging it back into the original equation to ensure it's correct.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\nPlug \\(x = 1\\) back into the original equation to see if both sides are equal.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\\[\n8^{4(1) - 6} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1 + 5}\n\\]\nSimplify the exponents:\n\\[\n8^{-2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{6}\n\\]\nCalculate each side:\n\\[\n8^{-2} = \\frac{1}{8^2} = \\frac{1}{64} \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{6} = \\frac{1}{2^6} = \\frac{1}{64}\n\\]\nBoth sides are equal:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{1}{64}\n\\]\n**Checking the Solution:**\n\nWait, both sides are equal, so \\(x = 1\\) is indeed the correct solution. The verification confirms that our steps were correct.\n\n---\n\n**Alternate Strategy: Using Logarithms**\n\nJust to explore another method, I could have applied logarithms to both sides from the beginning. Here's how that would look:\n\n**Step 1: Taking Logarithms of Both Sides**\n\nTake the logarithm (let's use natural logarithm, but any base would work) of both sides:\n\\[\n\\ln(8^{4x - 6}) = \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x + 5}\\right)\n\\]\nUsing the power rule of logarithms (\\(\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)\\)):\n\\[\n(4x - 6) \\ln(8) = (x + 5) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n**Step 2: Expressing \\(\\ln(8)\\) and \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\)**\n\nRecall that:\n\\[\n\\ln(8) = \\ln(2^3) = 3\\ln(2) \\\\\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\ln(2^{-1}) = -\\ln(2)\n\\]\nSo the equation becomes:\n\\[\n(4x - 6)(3\\ln(2)) = (x + 5)(-\\ln(2))\n\\]\n**Step 3: Simplifying the Equation**\n\nDistribute both sides:\n\\[\n12x \\ln(2) - 18 \\ln(2) = -x \\ln(2) - 5 \\ln(2)\n\\]\nAdd \\(x \\ln(2)\\) to both sides:\n\\[\n12x \\ln(2) + x \\ln(2) - 18 \\ln(2) = -5 \\ln(2) \\\\\n(12x + x) \\ln(2) - 18 \\ln(2) = -5 \\ln(2) \\\\\n13x \\ln(2) - 18 \\ln(2) = -5 \\ln(2)\n\\]\n**Step 4: Solving for \\(x\\)**\n\nAdd \\(18 \\ln(2)\\) to both sides:\n\\[\n13x \\ln(2) = -5 \\ln(2) + 18 \\ln(2) \\\\\n13x \\ln(2) = 13 \\ln(2)\n\\]\nDivide both sides by \\(13 \\ln(2)\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{13 \\ln(2)}{13 \\ln(2)} \\\\\nx = 1\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis alternate method also leads us to \\(x = 1\\), confirming that our initial approach was correct. It's always good to try multiple strategies to ensure the solution is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy starting with expressing both sides in terms of the same base, I was able to solve the equation straightforwardly. Checking the solution by plugging \\(x = 1\\) back into the original equation verified its correctness. Exploring an alternate method using logarithms further validated the solution. \n\nIt's essential to reflect and verify each step, and being open to trying different strategies ensures accuracy in solving such problems.",
