    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think it through step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's begin by exploring the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see the question **$Compute \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 8 \\end{pmatrix}\\)$**, my initial reaction is to recognize that this involves vectors and their multiplication. Specifically, I remember that there are different types of vector multiplications: **dot product** and **cross product**. Since both vectors are 2D, I think the **dot product** is the appropriate operation here. \n\nBut before jumping in, let me brainstorm a bit:\n\n- **Is it a Dot Product or Cross Product?** Wait, but since both vectors are in 2D, the **cross product** isn't defined in the same way as in 3D. So, that makes me lean towards the **dot product** as the correct operation.\n  \n- **How to Compute the Dot Product?** I recall that to compute the dot product of two vectors, you multiply their corresponding components and then sum those products. But let me double-check if I remember correctly.\n\n- **Negative Components:** I notice that both vectors have negative components. Will that affect the calculation? I think so\u2014multiplying negatives might lead to positives, which is interesting.\n\nHmm, everything seems to point towards the **dot product** being the right approach. Let\u2019s proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding Dot Product**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe **dot product** of two vectors \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is defined as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = a_1 \\times b_1 + a_2 \\times b_2\n\\]\n\nSo, I\u2019m supposed to multiply the corresponding components of the vectors and then add those products together.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this formula apply here? Yes, both vectors are 2D, so the dot product is valid.\n\n**Action:**  \nLet's apply this formula to our vectors \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 8 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Dot Product**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI need to multiply the components of the vectors:\n\n1. Multiply the first components: \\(-4 \\times 6\\)\n2. Multiply the second components: \\(-1 \\times 8\\)\n3. Add those two products together\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 8 \\end{pmatrix} = (-4 \\times 6) + (-1 \\times 8)\n\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n- **First Component:**  \n  \\(-4 \\times 6 = -24\\)\n  \n- **Second Component:**  \n  \\(-1 \\times 8 = -8\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, I\u2019m adding two negative numbers. The sum should be negative, which makes sense here.\n\n**Adding Them Together:**  \n\\(-24 + (-8) = -32\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Checking the Calculation**\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- Does \\(-32\\) seem too large? Hmm, let me think. Both vectors have negative and positive components, and the products are negative. Adding them makes sense to yield a negative result.\n  \n**Deeper Reflection:**  \n- Is there another way to verify this? Perhaps using the properties of the dot product, like angles or magnitudes, but that's more complex. I think sticking to the definition is solid for this problem.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe calculation seems correct. The dot product is indeed \\(-32\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Visualizing the Dot Product**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nMaybe I can visualize what the dot product represents. It\u2019s a measure of how aligned the two vectors are. If they\u2019re orthogonal, the dot product is zero. Here, both vectors have negative components, and they\u2019re not orthogonal, so a negative value makes sense.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this align with our calculation? Yes, a negative dot product indicates an angle greater than 90 degrees between the vectors, which fits with the component signs.\n\n**Action:**  \nThis reaffirms our previous calculation. The dot product being \\(-32\\) is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully computing and checking each step, the dot product is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-32}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorming Was Key:** Initially pondering whether to use the dot product or cross product helped clarify the approach.\n  \n- **Step-by-Step Calculation:** Breaking down the dot product formula into individual multiplications and sums ensured accuracy.\n  \n- **Reflecting and Checking:** Regularly checking if the results made sense\u2014both numerically and conceptually\u2014provided confidence in the final answer.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies Helped Verify:** Considering the geometric interpretation of the dot product validated our numeric result.\n\nOverall, approaching the problem methodically, checking at each step, and being open to exploring different strategies led to a correct and confident solution.",
