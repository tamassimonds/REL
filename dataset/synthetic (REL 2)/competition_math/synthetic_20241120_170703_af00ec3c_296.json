    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. I\u2019ll approach it just like I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll start:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem states that integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) with \\( x > y > 0 \\) satisfy the equation:\n\n\\[\nx + y + xy = 80\n\\]\n\nAnd we're asked to find \\( x \\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- The equation involves both addition and multiplication, which makes me think it might be factorable or could relate to some algebraic identity.\n- I remember something about factorizations involving products and sums\u2014maybe the expression can be rewritten in a way that reveals more about the relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n- Another thought is to try and express one variable in terms of the other, but since both are integers and the equation is symmetric in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), it might lead to multiple solutions unless we impose additional conditions.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Try rewriting the equation to factor it or simplify it.\n2. **Substitution:** Express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) or vice versa.\n3. **Test Integer Pairs:** Since \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers, maybe testing plausible pairs could work.\n4. **Quadratic Equation:** Consider rearranging to form a quadratic equation in one of the variables.\n\n**Exploring the First Strategy: Algebraic Manipulation**\n\nLet\u2019s start with **Algebraic Manipulation** to see if the equation can be factored.\n\nThe equation is:\n\\[\nx + y + xy = 80\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Hmm, I notice that the left side is \\( x + y + xy \\). This looks similar to the expansion of \\( (x + 1)(y + 1) \\), which is \\( xy + x + y + 1 \\).\n- If I could express it like that, maybe factoring would be straightforward.\n\n**Attempt:**\n\\[\nx + y + xy = (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1\n\\]\n\nBut wait, multiplying out \\( (x + 1)(y + 1) \\) gives:\n\\[\nxy + x + y + 1\n\\]\nSo, subtracting 1 makes it:\n\\[\nxy + x + y\n\\]\nwhich is the same as the left side.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Okay, so \\( x + y + xy = (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1 \\). This might help in factoring the equation.\n\n**Next Step:**\nLet\u2019s rearrange the original equation using this identity:\n\\[\nx + y + xy = 80 \\implies (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1 = 80 \\implies (x + 1)(y + 1) = 81\n\\]\n\n**Checking if this makes sense:**\n- This transformation seems valid because adding 1 to both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) should simplify the expression involving their product and sum.\n\n---\n\n### **Second Strategy: Expressing as Products**\n\nNow that we have:\n\\[\n(x + 1)(y + 1) = 81\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- This equation states that the product of \\( (x + 1) \\) and \\( (y + 1) \\) is 81. Since 81 is a known integer, we can find integer pairs \\( (x + 1) \\) and \\( (y + 1) \\) whose product is 81.\n- Given that \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers and \\( x > y > 0 \\), the pairs must also satisfy these conditions after subtracting 1.\n\n**Possible Factor Pairs of 81:**\n- 1 \u00d7 81\n- 3 \u00d7 27\n- 9 \u00d7 9\n\n**Assigning Factors:**\n- Since \\( x > y \\), we should assign the larger factor to \\( x + 1 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **First Pair: (1, 81)**\n   - \\( x + 1 = 81 \\implies x = 80 \\)\n   - \\( y + 1 = 1 \\implies y = 0 \\) (But \\( y > 0 \\), so this pair is invalid)\n\n2. **Second Pair: (3, 27)**\n   - \\( x + 1 = 27 \\implies x = 26 \\)\n   - \\( y + 1 = 3 \\implies y = 2 \\)\n   - This satisfies \\( x > y > 0 \\).\n\n3. **Third Pair: (9, 9)**\n   - \\( x + 1 = 9 \\implies x = 8 \\)\n   - \\( y + 1 = 9 \\implies y = 8 \\)\n   - But this violates \\( x > y \\), so this pair is invalid.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- It seems that only the second pair \\( (3, 27) \\) works, giving us \\( x = 26 \\) and \\( y = 2 \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Let me verify if these values satisfy the original equation:\n  \\[\n  x + y + xy = 26 + 2 + (26 \\times 2) = 28 + 52 = 80\n  \\]\n- Yes, it matches the given condition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Based on this factorization approach, \\( x = 26 \\) is the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Substitution and Solving for One Variable**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To cross-verify, let's try expressing one variable in terms of the other and solve the equation step-by-step.\n\n**Starting with the Original Equation:**\n\\[\nx + y + xy = 80\n\\]\n\n**Express \\( y \\) in Terms of \\( x \\):**\n\\[\ny + xy = 80 - x \\implies y(1 + x) = 80 - x \\implies y = \\frac{80 - x}{1 + x}\n\\]\n\n**Requirements:**\n- \\( y \\) must be an integer, so \\( 80 - x \\) must be divisible by \\( 1 + x \\).\n- Also, \\( y > 0 \\) and \\( x > y \\).\n\n**Finding Valid \\( x \\) Values:**\n- Since \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers, \\( \\frac{80 - x}{1 + x} \\) must yield an integer value greater than 0.\n- Additionally, \\( x \\) must be greater than \\( \\frac{80 - x}{1 + x} \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **Inequality for \\( y > 0 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{80 - x}{1 + x} > 0 \\implies 80 - x > 0 \\text{ and } 1 + x > 0\n   \\]\n   - Hence, \\( x < 80 \\) and \\( x > -1 \\) (but since \\( x > y > 0 \\), we only care about positive \\( x \\)).\n\n2. **Inequality for \\( x > y \\):**\n   \\[\n   x > \\frac{80 - x}{1 + x}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x(1 + x) > 80 - x \\implies x + x^2 > 80 - x \\implies x^2 + 2x - 80 > 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Solve the quadratic equation: } x^2 + 2x - 80 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 320}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 18}{2} = 8 \\text{ or } -10\n   \\]\n   - Since \\( x > 0 \\), we take \\( x = 8 \\).\n\n**Checking \\( x = 8 \\):**\n- Compute \\( y \\):\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{80 - 8}{1 + 8} = \\frac{72}{9} = 8\n  \\]\n- Wait, this gives \\( x = y = 8 \\), which contradicts \\( x > y \\). Therefore, \\( x = 8 \\) is not a valid solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This substitution method led us to a contradiction, indicating that not all \\( x \\) values below 80 are valid.\n- It suggests that perhaps only specific \\( x \\) values derived from the factorization approach are correct.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Revisiting Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Given that the substitution method didn't yield a valid solution within the constraints, let's rely more on the factorization method which worked earlier.\n\n**Reexamining the Factor Pairs of 81:**\n- The only viable pair was \\( (3, 27) \\), leading to \\( x = 26 \\) and \\( y = 2 \\).\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Confirming again:\n  \\[\n  x + y + xy = 26 + 2 + (26 \\times 2) = 28 + 52 = 80\n  \\]\n- This satisfies the original equation perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Despite the substitution method pointing toward \\( x = 8 \\), which resulted in a contradiction, the factorization method consistently leads to \\( x = 26 \\) and \\( y = 2 \\) as the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Verification**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies:** Starting with algebraic manipulation helped identify a relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) through factorization. The substitution method provided a different perspective but led to a contradiction, reinforcing that \\( x = 26 \\) is correct.\n- **Checking Constraints:** Throughout the process, ensuring \\( x > y > 0 \\) was crucial in validating potential solutions.\n- **Consistency:** Both the factorization approach and the verification steps confirm that \\( x = 26 \\) is the only solution that satisfies all conditions.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{26}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step exploration, with brainstorming, reflection, and multiple strategy attempts, ensures a thorough and error-checked path to the solution.",
