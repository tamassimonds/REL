    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, mirroring a human's thought process with brainstorming, checking, reflecting, and adjusting strategies as needed. I'll think out loud, exploring different approaches, and naturally checking my work throughout.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first read the question, it asks for the least three-digit whole number whose digits multiply to 6. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Three-Digit Number:** Okay, so the number must be between 100 and 999.\n- **Product of Digits is 6:** This reminds me of problems involving factors or maybe even prime factorization since 6 is a relatively small number.\n- **Least Number:** I need the smallest possible three-digit number that fits the criteria, which suggests I should start with the smallest hundreds place possible.\n\n**Wait, That Can\u2019t Be Right:**\n\n- **First Thought:** Maybe I should look at multiplying single-digit numbers that could give 6. But then, how do I ensure it's a three-digit number?\n- **Check:** Multiplying 1, 2, and 3 gives 6, but arranging them to form the smallest three-digit number is tricky.\n\nAlright, I need to brainstorm differently. Maybe I can list all combinations of digits that multiply to 6 and then see which forms the smallest three-digit number.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\n**Strategy 1:** **List Possible Combinations of Digits**\n\n- **Single-Digit Factors of 6:** 1, 2, 3, 6.\n- **Combine These Digits:** Try different combinations to form three-digit numbers.\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...**\n\n- **Reflection:** Listing all combinations might be time-consuming. Is there a more systematic way?\n\n**Hmm, maybe I need to back up and try...**\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Instead of listing all, perhaps I can think about the place values and how to minimize the number by strategically placing the digits.\n\n**Oh! This reminds me of...**\n\n- **Thinking Aloud:** Just like in optimization problems, placing the largest digit in the highest place value (hundreds) usually minimizes the overall number.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s proceed with this adjusted strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identify Valid Digit Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The product of three digits must be 6.\n- Possible combinations of single-digit numbers that multiply to 6 are:\n  - \\(1 \\times 1 \\times 6 = 6\\)\n  - \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 6\\)\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Is this Exhaustive?:** Yes, because any other combination involves digits larger than 6, which aren\u2019t single digits.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?:** Only \\(1, 1, 6\\) and \\(1, 2, 3\\) are valid combinations where the product is 6.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Form Three-Digit Numbers**\n\n**Strategy:** **Arrange Digits to Minimize the Number**\n\n**Combination 1:** **Digits: 1, 1, 6**\n\n- **Possible Arrangements:**\n  - 116\n  - 161\n  - 611\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Among 116, 161, and 611, the smallest is 116.\n\n**Combination 2:** **Digits: 1, 2, 3**\n\n- **Possible Arrangements:**\n  - 123\n  - 132\n  - 213\n  - 231\n  - 312\n  - 321\n\n**Check:**\n\n- The smallest number here is 123.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n- Between 116 and 123, 116 is smaller.\n\n**But Wait, That Can\u2019t Be Right Because...**\n\n- **Reflection:** I only considered permutations. Maybe there\u2019s another combination I missed.\n\n**Ahh, I remember...**\n\n- **Rechecking:** I recalled that the combination \\(1, 1, 6\\) should be the least since arranging 6 in the hundreds place maximizes the number. Let\u2019s verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verify the Least Number**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Least Three-Digit Number:** Must be minimal after considering all valid digit combinations.\n- **Product of Digits:** Must equal 6.\n\n**Using Combination \\(1, 1, 6\\):**\n\n- **Forming 116:**\n  - \\(1 \\times 1 \\times 6 = 6\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - Three-digit number: 116 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Using Combination \\(1, 2, 3\\):**\n\n- **Forming 123:**\n  - \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 6\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - Three-digit number: 123 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n- 116 vs. 123: **116** is smaller.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Is 116 the Correct Answer?:** Yes, because:\n  - It\u2019s a three-digit number.\n  - The product of its digits is 6.\n  - It\u2019s smaller than any other three-digit number meeting the criteria.\n\n**But Let's Double-Check...**\n\n- **Quick Calculations:** \n  - \\(1 \\times 1 \\times 6 = 6\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 6\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Does This Confirm My Approach?:** Yes, because both combinations yield valid three-digit numbers, and 116 is the smallest.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n**Was This Approach Effective?:**\n\n- **Yes:** By listing valid digit combinations and arranging them to form the smallest three-digit number, I systematically arrived at the correct answer.\n\n**Did I Encounter Any Challenges?:**\n\n- **Initially, Yes:** I almost got sidetracked by considering permutations without focusing on minimizing the number. Reflecting helped me redirect my approach.\n\n**Is 116 Definitely the Correct Answer?:**\n\n- **Confirmed:** All checks align\u2014116\u2019s digits multiply to 6, and it's the smallest three-digit number that does so.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAfter brainstorming, exploring different strategies, checking each step, and verifying the final result, **the least three-digit whole number whose digits' product is 6 is **116**.\n\n---\n\nThroughout the process, I aimed to think openly, reflect frequently, and adapt my strategies as needed, just like a human would when solving a problem.",

  "ground_truth": "We must minimize first the hundreds digit and then the tens digit to find the least three-digit whole number the product of whose digits is 6. The smallest possible hundreds digit is 1, and the least tens digit is 1 as well, giving a units digit of 6. Thus the least number is $\\boxed{116}$."
