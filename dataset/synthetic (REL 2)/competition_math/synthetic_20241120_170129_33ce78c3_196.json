    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a human thought process. We'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check our work, and be open to changing our approach if things don't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the equation:\n\n\\[ 5 = \\frac{x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x}{x + 2} \\]\n\nMy immediate reaction is that this involves both a polynomial and a rational expression. It reminds me of problems where you set a numerator equal to a certain value after clearing the denominator. But I also recall that there might be issues with simplifying rational expressions directly, especially if the denominator could factor into the numerator.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n1. **Cross-Multiplication:** This seems like a straightforward way to eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by \\(x + 2\\).\n2. **Factoring:** Maybe the numerator can be factored to simplify the expression before clearing the fraction.\n3. **Synthetic Division:** Since we have a cubic polynomial divided by a linear one, perhaps synthetic or long division could simplify the problem.\n4. **Substitution or Transformation:** Could substituting values or transforming the equation help?\n\n**Initial Idea:**\nCross-multiplication comes to mind first. It seems direct: if I multiply both sides by \\(x + 2\\), the fraction should disappear, leaving a polynomial equation to solve. But before committing, I should consider if the left side simplifies nicely or if there are any restrictions (like \\(x \\neq -2\\)) to keep in mind.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting Cross-Multiplication**\n\nLet's try cross-multiplying to see where it leads.\n\n\\[\n5(x + 2) = x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Multiply both sides by \\(x + 2\\) to eliminate the fraction.\n- This should give me a polynomial equation to work with.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n5x + 10 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, this looks like a standard polynomial equation now. But wait, there's a cubic term on the right. Cubic equations can have multiple solutions, so I'm preparing for potentially more than one \\(x\\)-value.\n\n**Check:**\nBefore proceeding, I remember to check if \\(x = -2\\) is a valid solution. Since dividing by \\(x + 2\\) originally could create an undefined condition, \\(x = -2\\) might be a problematic root. However, in cross-multiplying, we're technically sidestepping the fraction, so maybe it still applies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Rearranging the Equation**\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 2x^2 - 8x - 5x - 10 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nNow we have a cubic equation set to zero. At this point, I need to find the roots of this equation. But before diving in, let's explore different methods to see which might be the easiest.\n\n**Thinking About Strategies:**\n- **Factoring:** Check if the cubic can be factored into lower-degree polynomials.\n- **Synthetic Division:** Use potential rational roots to simplify the equation.\n- **Graphing:** Plotting might give a visual idea of where the roots are.\n- **Using Formulas:** Apply the cubic formula, but it's often complex and might not be necessary if factoring or synthetic division works.\n\n**Possible Approach:**\nLet\u2019s start with factoring. If that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll consider synthetic division or graphing.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Trying to Factor the Cubic Equation**\n\nLooking at:\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Factoring cubics can sometimes be tricky, especially without a clear pattern.\n- I could look for integer roots using the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests testing factors of the constant term (-10) over factors of the leading coefficient (1).\n\n**Potential Rational Roots:**\nFactors of -10: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b15, \u00b110\n\n**Testing x = 1:**\n\n\\[\n1^3 - 2(1)^2 - 13(1) - 10 = 1 - 2 - 13 - 10 = -24 \\quad (\\text{Not a root})\n\\]\n\n**Testing x = -1:**\n\n\\[\n(-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 - 13(-1) - 10 = -1 - 2 + 13 - 10 = 0 \\quad (\\text{Root found})\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, I found \\(x = -1\\) is a root. That\u2019s great! If \\(x = -1\\) is a root, I can factor the cubic polynomial by dividing it by \\(x + 1\\).\n\n**Check:**\nBefore proceeding, let's quickly verify:\n\n\\[\n(-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 - 13(-1) - 10 = -1 - 2 + 13 - 10 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Confirmation:**\nYes, it checks out. \\(x = -1\\) is indeed a root.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Factoring the Cubic Polynomial**\n\nSince \\(x = -1\\) is a root, I can factor the polynomial as follows:\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10 = (x + 1)(\\text{Quadratic})\n\\]\n\n**Finding the Quadratic Factor:**\nTo find the quadratic factor, divide the cubic polynomial by \\(x + 1\\) using synthetic division.\n\n**Synthetic Division Setup:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n-1 & 1 & -2 & -13 & -10 \\\\\n   &   & -1 & 3 & 10 \\\\\n\\hline\n   & 1 & -3 & -10 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Steps:**\n- Bring down the leading coefficient (1).\n- Multiply by -1 (the root) and write under the next coefficient.\n- Add column-wise.\n\n**Result:**\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10 = (x + 1)(x^2 - 3x - 10)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis looks good. Now, I have a quadratic that I can solve for the other roots.\n\n**Check:**\nBefore moving on, let's confirm the synthetic division:\n\n\\[\n(x + 1)(x^2 - 3x - 10) = x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 3x^2 - 10x + x^2 - 3x - 10 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10\n\\]\n\n**Confirmation:**\nYes, it matches. The factoring is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\nNow, solve the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 3x - 10 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thinking About Strategies:**\n- **Factoring the Quadratic:** See if it can be factored easily.\n- **Quadratic Formula:** If factoring is difficult, use the quadratic formula.\n\n**Factoring Attempt:**\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -10 and add to -3.\n\nPossible pairs: (1, -10), (2, -5), (-1, 10), (-2, 5)\n\nWait, none of these add up to -3. So, factoring might not be straightforward here.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\nLet\u2019s use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(a = 1\\)\n- \\(b = -3\\)\n- \\(c = -10\\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-10)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 40}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm 7}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, the quadratic equation gives us two additional roots: \\(x = 5\\) and \\(x = -2\\).\n\n**Check:**\nWait a minute, earlier I thought \\(x = -2\\) might be problematic because it makes the denominator zero in the original equation. But here, it\u2019s coming out as a root. This is a red flag.\n\n**Realization:**\nThe quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 3x - 10 = 0\\) is giving us \\(x = -2\\) as a root. However, in the context of the original equation, \\(x = -2\\) would make the denominator zero, leading to an undefined expression. Therefore, \\(x = -2\\) is not a valid solution for the original equation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI need to discard \\(x = -2\\) from the list of solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Listing Valid Solutions**\n\nFrom the factoring and solving process, the valid \\(x\\)-values that satisfy the original equation are:\n\n- \\(x = -1\\)\n- \\(x = 5\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I found three roots from the cubic equation: \\(x = -1\\), \\(x = 5\\), and \\(x = -2\\).\n- However, \\(x = -2\\) is not valid because it makes the denominator zero in the original equation.\n\n**Check:**\nLet\u2019s quickly verify if \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 5\\) satisfy the original equation.\n\n**Testing \\(x = -1\\):**\n\n\\[\n5 = \\frac{(-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 - 8(-1)}{-1 + 2} = \\frac{-1 - 2 + 8}{1} = \\frac{5}{1} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Result:**\nTrue. \\(x = -1\\) satisfies the original equation.\n\n**Testing \\(x = 5\\):**\n\n\\[\n5 = \\frac{(5)^3 - 2(5)^2 - 8(5)}{5 + 2} = \\frac{125 - 50 - 40}{7} = \\frac{35}{7} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Result:**\nTrue. \\(x = 5\\) also satisfies the original equation.\n\n**Reflection:**\nBoth \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 5\\) are valid solutions. Therefore, the sum of the \\(x\\)-values that satisfy the equation is:\n\n\\[\n-1 + 5 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes the sum make sense? The problem asked for the sum of the \\(x\\)-values that satisfy the equation. We've identified the valid solutions, and their sum is 4. This seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe sum of the \\(x\\)-values that satisfy the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout this problem:\n\n- **Brainstorming helped:** Initially considering cross-multiplication led me to set up a polynomial equation.\n- **Factoring was key:** Identifying \\(x = -1\\) as a root allowed me to factor the cubic polynomial and simplify the problem.\n- **Quadratic formula clarified:** Solving the quadratic equation provided the remaining root, but I had to be cautious about the denominator issue with \\(x = -2\\).\n- **Verification ensured correctness:** Checking each solution against the original equation confirmed their validity.\n\nBy being open to changing strategies when factoring didn't work initially and double-checking the validity of each root, I arrived at the correct sum of the \\(x\\)-values.",

  "ground_truth": "We can factor $x$ out of the numerator so that we're left with $$\\frac{x(x^2-2x-8)}{x+2}=\\frac{x(x-4)(x+2)}{x+2}$$After canceling out the $x+2$ from the numerator and denominator, we have $x(x-4)=5$.  Solving for the roots of a quadratic equation, we have $x^2-4x-5=0$, which gives us $(x-5)(x+1)=0$ and $x=5$ or $x=-1$. The sum of these values is $\\boxed{4}$, which is our answer.\n\nAlternatively, since the sum of the solutions for a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $-b/a$, the sum of the zeros of the quadratic $x^2-4x-5$ is $4/1=\\boxed{4}$."
