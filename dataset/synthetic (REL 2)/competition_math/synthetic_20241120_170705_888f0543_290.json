    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see how we can tackle it step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking if my approach makes sense along the way. It's important to think out loud, explore various methods, and adjust the plan as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I see that ***\u22127*** is a solution to the equation ***\ud835\udc65\u00b2 + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc65 \u2212 28 = 0***. Immediately, I recognize this as a **quadratic equation**, and I recall that quadratic equations can have **real or complex solutions**.\n\nNow, thinking back to what I know:\n\n- **Quadratic equations** have solutions that can be found using the **quadratic formula**.\n- Alternatively, if I know one solution, I can use the **factored form** of the equation to find the other coefficient.\n\nBut wait, I notice something interesting: the equation is set to ***\u221228***, and one of the solutions is ***\u22127***. This might hint at something specific about the relationship between the coefficients and the solutions.\n\nMy initial instinct is to use the **quadratic formula**, but let's brainstorm if there might be a more straightforward method, like factoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula Approach:**\n   - Use ***\ud835\udc65 = (\u2212\ud835\udc4f \u00b1 \u221a(\ud835\udc4f\u00b2 \u2212 4\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50)) / 2\ud835\udc4e*** to solve for ***\ud835\udc65***.\n   - Since we know ***\u22127*** is a solution, substitute that into the formula to find ***\ud835\udc4f***.\n\n2. **Factored Form Approach:**\n   - If ***\u22127*** is a solution, the equation can be factored as ***\ud835\udc65 + 7(\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f) = 0***, where ***\ud835\udc5f*** is the other root.\n   - Expand and compare with the original equation to find ***\ud835\udc4f***.\n\n3. **Vieta's Formulas:**\n   - Recall that for quadratic equations, the sum and product of the roots are related to the coefficients.\n   - Use the fact that the sum of the roots equals ***\u2212\ud835\udc4f/\ud835\udc4e*** and the product equals ***\ud835\udc50/\ud835\udc4e***.\n\nI'm leaning towards the **Factored Form Approach** because it seems more direct: if ***\u22127*** is a root, the equation must be divisible by ***\ud835\udc65 + 7***. But let's check if this makes sense or if another method might be easier.\n\n**Reflection:** Factoring seems promising since we know one root explicitly. However, if factoring becomes cumbersome, I might fall back on the quadratic formula or Vieta's formulas.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Factored Form Approach**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the **Factored Form Approach**:\n\n1. **Set Up the Factored Equation:**\n   - Since ***\u22127*** is a solution, the equation can be written as:\n     \\[\n     \ud835\udc65 + 7(\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f) = 0\n     \\]\n     where ***\ud835\udc5f*** is the other root.\n\n2. **Expand the Factored Equation:**\n   - Distribute:\n     \\[\n     \ud835\udc65\u00b2 + 7\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc65 + 7\ud835\udc5f = 0\n     \\]\n   - Combine like terms:\n     \\[\n     \ud835\udc65\u00b2 + (7 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f)\ud835\udc65 + 7\ud835\udc5f = 0\n     \\]\n    \n3. **Compare With the Original Equation:**\n   - The original equation is:\n     \\[\n     \ud835\udc65\u00b2 + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc65 \u2212 28 = 0\n     \\]\n   - By comparing coefficients:\n     \\[\n     7 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udc4f \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 7\ud835\udc5f = \u221228\n     \\]\n\n**Reflection:** This seems to be working so far. Now, let\u2019s solve for ***\ud835\udc5f*** using the second equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving for \ud835\udc5f**\n\nFrom the equation ***7\ud835\udc5f = \u221228***:\n\n\\[\n\ud835\udc5f = \\frac{\u221228}{7} = \u22124\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? If ***\ud835\udc5f = \u22124***, then:\n\n- The other root is ***\u22124***.\n- The product of the roots ***\ud835\udc5f \u00d7 (\u22127) = \u22124 \u00d7 (\u22127) = 28***, which matches ***\ud835\udc50\u2605/\ud835\udc4e = \u221228/1***.\n\n**Reflection:** Everything checks out. Now, let's find ***\ud835\udc4f*** using ***7 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udc4f***.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \ud835\udc4f**\n\nSubstitute ***\ud835\udc5f = \u22124*** into the equation ***\ud835\udc4f = 7 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f***:\n\n\\[\n\ud835\udc4f = 7 \u2212 (\u22124) = 7 + 4 = 11\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Is ***\ud835\udc4f = 11*** consistent with the original equation? Let\u2019s plug it back into the original equation and see if everything holds.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verification**\n\nPlug ***\ud835\udc4f = 11*** into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\ud835\udc65\u00b2 + 11\ud835\udc65 \u2212 28 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Factoring the New Equation:**\n\n- We know one root is ***\u22127***.\n- The other root is ***\u22124*** (found earlier).\n\nSo, the factored form should be:\n\n\\[\n(\ud835\udc65 + 7)(\ud835\udc65 \u2212 4) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Expanding:**\n\n\\[\n\ud835\udc65\u00b2 \u2212 4\ud835\udc65 + 7\ud835\udc65 \u2212 28 = \ud835\udc65\u00b2 + 3\ud835\udc65 \u2212 28\n\\]\n\nWait a minute! This doesn\u2019t match ***\ud835\udc65\u00b2 + 11\ud835\udc65 \u2212 28 = 0***. There seems to be a mistake here. Let me re-examine my steps.\n\n**Reflection:** Oops, I must have made an error somewhere. Let\u2019s trace back and see where it went wrong.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Identifying the Mistake**\n\nLooking back, I see the issue arose in Step 3. Let\u2019s correct it.\n\n- Originally, I factored the equation as ***\ud835\udc65 + 7(\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f) = 0***.\n- When expanding, I combined terms incorrectly.\n\nLet me redo the expansion correctly:\n\n\\[\n\ud835\udc65 + 7(\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f) = \ud835\udc65 + 7\ud835\udc65 \u2212 7\ud835\udc5f = 8\ud835\udc65 \u2212 7\ud835\udc5f\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn\u2019t seem right. Let me try factoring differently.\n\n**Alternative Factored Form:**\n\nIf ***\u22127*** is a root, the equation can be factored as:\n\n\\[\n\ud835\udc65\u00b2 + 7\ud835\udc65 \u2212 4\ud835\udc65 \u2212 28 = 0\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n\ud835\udc65\u00b2 + 3\ud835\udc65 \u2212 28 = 0\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t match the original equation either. Let\u2019s go back to the original factored form:\n\n\\[\n(\ud835\udc65 + 7)(\ud835\udc65 \u2212 4) = \ud835\udc65\u00b2 + 3\ud835\udc65 \u2212 28\n\\]\n\nThis contradicts the original equation ***\ud835\udc65\u00b2 + 11\ud835\udc65 \u2212 28 = 0***. Clearly, something is off.\n\n**Reflection:** There\u2019s a consistent mistake here. I need to backtrack and see where my initial approach faltered.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Reassessing the Factored Form Approach**\n\nPerhaps my initial factored form setup was incorrect. Let\u2019s try a different approach to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nSince ***\u22127*** is a root, the equation can be factored as:\n\n\\[\n\ud835\udc65\u00b2 + 7\ud835\udc65 + 5\ud835\udc65 \u2212 28 = 0\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n\ud835\udc65\u00b2 + 12\ud835\udc65 \u2212 28 = 0\n\\]\n\nBut this still doesn\u2019t match the original equation. I see that my factored form attempts are leading to inconsistencies.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:** Maybe the **Quadratic Formula Approach** would be more straightforward here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Quadratic Formula Approach**\n\nLet\u2019s switch gears and use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\n\ud835\udc65 = \\frac{\u2212\ud835\udc4f \u00b1 \u221a(\ud835\udc4f\u00b2 \u2212 4\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50)}{2\ud835\udc4e}\n\\]\n\nGiven that ***\u22127*** is a root, we can substitute ***\ud835\udc65 = \u22127*** into the equation to solve for ***\ud835\udc4f***.\n\n**Substituting \ud835\udc65 = \u22127:**\n\n\\[\n(\u22127)\u00b2 + \ud835\udc4f(\u22127) \u2212 28 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n49 \u2212 7\ud835\udc4f \u2212 28 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n21 \u2212 7\ud835\udc4f = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\u22127\ud835\udc4f = \u221221\n\\]\n\\[\n\ud835\udc4f = \\frac{\u221221}{\u22127} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, now we have ***\ud835\udc4f = 3***. Let\u2019s verify if this aligns with the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Verification with \ud835\udc4f = 3**\n\nPlug ***\ud835\udc4f = 3*** back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\ud835\udc65\u00b2 + 3\ud835\udc65 \u2212 28 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Factoring the New Equation:**\n\nWe know one root is ***\u22127***. Let\u2019s find the other root using the quadratic formula.\n\n\\[\n\ud835\udc65 = \\frac{\u22123 \u00b1 \u221a(3\u00b2 \u2212 4(1)(\u221228))}{2(1)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\ud835\udc65 = \\frac{\u22123 \u00b1 \u221a(9 + 112)}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\ud835\udc65 = \\frac{\u22123 \u00b1 \u221a121}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\ud835\udc65 = \\frac{\u22123 \u00b1 11}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\ud835\udc65 = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \ud835\udc65 = \\frac{\u221214}{2} = \u22127\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Now, the roots are ***4*** and ***\u22127***, which aligns with our earlier findings. Therefore, ***\ud835\udc4f = 3*** is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nAll steps now consistently lead to the same conclusion:\n\n- Using the **Quadratic Formula Approach**, we derived ***\ud835\udc4f = 3***.\n- Verification through factoring confirms the correctness.\n\n**Mistakes Corrected:** Initially, the **Factored Form Approach** led to inconsistencies due to misapplying the expansion. Switching to the **Quadratic Formula Approach** provided a clear and accurate solution.\n\n**Final Answer:** ***\ud835\udc4f = 3***\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** Initially, I considered multiple strategies, starting with the **Factored Form Approach**, which led to some confusion and incorrect conclusions. Realizing the inconsistencies, I reassessed my method and switched to the **Quadratic Formula Approach**, which smoothly guided me to the correct value of ***\ud835\udc4f = 3***. Throughout the process, reflecting on each step and verifying the correctness helped ensure the final answer was accurate.",
