    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it just like I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work, and adjusting my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem is about a five-digit number, **246_8**, which is missing a digit. The number is **divisible by 9**. Right off the bat, I remember that there's a divisibility rule for 9: **a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9**. \n\nBut before jumping in, let me brainstorm:\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Use the divisibility rule for 9 and calculate the sum of the known digits, then see what the missing digit could be.\n  \n- **Strategy 2:** List possible digits (0-9) for the blank and check which makes the entire number divisible by 9.\n  \n- **Strategy 3:** Maybe there's a pattern or property of numbers divisible by 9 that I can apply here.\n\nHmm, Strategy 1 seems the most direct. But just to be thorough, I'll consider the other strategies as backups. Let's start with Strategy 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Apply the Divisibility Rule for 9**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- According to the rule, the sum of all digits must be divisible by 9.\n- I'll first calculate the sum of the known digits in **246_8**.\n- Then, I'll see what the missing digit can be to make the total sum divisible by 9.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Sum of Known Digits:**  \n   \\(2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20\\)\n\n2. **Include the Missing Digit:**  \n   Let\u2019s call the missing digit **x**.  \n   So, the total sum is \\(20 + x\\).\n\n3. **Check for Divisibility by 9:**  \n   We need \\(20 + x\\) to be divisible by 9.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Okay, \\(20 + x\\) needs to be a multiple of 9.\n- Let\u2019s see which values of \\(x\\) (from 0 to 9) make this happen.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- \\(20 + x = 21\\) when \\(x = 1\\) \u2192 Not divisible by 9.\n- \\(20 + x = 22\\) when \\(x = 2\\) \u2192 Not divisible by 9.\n- \\(20 + x = 23\\) when \\(x = 3\\) \u2192 Not divisible by 9.\n- \\(20 + x = 24\\) when \\(x = 4\\) \u2192 Not divisible by 9.\n- \\(20 + x = 25\\) when \\(x = 5\\) \u2192 Not divisible by 9.\n- \\(20 + x = 26\\) when \\(x = 6\\) \u2192 Not divisible by 9.\n- \\(20 + x = 27\\) when \\(x = 7\\) \u2192 Divisible by 9!\n- \\(20 + x = 28\\) when \\(x = 8\\) \u2192 Not divisible by 9.\n- \\(20 + x = 29\\) when \\(x = 9\\) \u2192 Not divisible by 9.\n\n**Observation:**\n- Only when \\(x = 7\\), the sum \\(20 + 7 = 27\\) is divisible by 9.\n\n**Preliminary Conclusion:**\n- It looks like the missing digit **x = 7** makes the number divisible by 9.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verify the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before finalizing, I should double-check if adding 7 indeed makes the entire number divisible by 9.\n- Also, make sure there aren't any other possible strategies leading to a different solution.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Sum with x = 7:**  \n   \\(2 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 27\\)\n\n2. **Check Divisibility by 9:**  \n   \\(27 \u00f7 9 = 3\\) \u2192 Perfectly divisible.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Yup, the sum is 27, which is divisible by 9. This confirms that **x = 7** is correct.\n\n**Check for Multiple Solutions:**\n- I initially considered listing all possible digits (0-9) to see which one works. Based on my quick check, only **x = 7** satisfies the condition.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- The strategy seems correct, and the calculations align. There are no other digits that make the sum divisible by 9.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Even though Strategy 1 worked, let's briefly look at the other strategies to ensure there are no alternative methods or easier approaches.\n\n**Strategy 2: Testing Each Digit:**\n- I already partially did this while applying the divisibility rule by checking each digit from 0 to 9.\n\n**Strategy 3: Patterns or Properties:**\n- Another property of numbers divisible by 9 is that the difference between the number and its nearest multiple of 9 should be a multiple of 9.\n- However, since the divisibility rule itself is straightforward here, this strategy feels redundant.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Strategy 1 was efficient and direct. Alternative strategies confirm the same result but aren't necessary considering the simplicity of the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thought and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Sum with \\(x = 7\\) is 27, which is divisible by 9.\n- No other digit satisfies the condition.\n- Alternative strategies align with the initial approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- After exploring different strategies, verifying each step, and ensuring all calculations are correct, **the missing digit is 7**.\n\nAh! This feels good. The step-by-step approach allowed me to confirm the solution while being open to adjusting strategies if needed. Always important to reflect and verify, especially when dealing with divisibility rules; they can sometimes lead you astray if not carefully applied. But in this case, everything checks out.",

  "ground_truth": "In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Since $2+4+6+8=20$, the only value of the missing digit that causes the sum of the digits to equal a multiple of 9 is $\\boxed{7}$, as $27=9\\cdot 3$."
