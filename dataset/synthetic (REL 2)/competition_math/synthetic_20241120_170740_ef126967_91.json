    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by brainstorming different strategies and reflecting on each step, just like how I would approach it naturally if I were working through it myself.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWhen I first see this question, a few things come to mind:\n\n- **Volume of a Pyramid:** I remember that the volume formula for a pyramid involves the area of the base and the height. Specifically, \\( V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} \\). This makes me think that knowing how the dimensions of the base and height change will be crucial.\n  \n- **Changes in Dimensions:** The problem states that the length of the base is doubled, the width is tripled, and the height is increased by 50%. This hints that I need to consider how these changes affect the volume.\n\n- **New Volume Calculation:** Finally, I need to calculate the volume of the new pyramid after these changes.\n\nBut honestly, I feel a bit mixed about how to start. Should I calculate the new dimensions and plug them into the volume formula, or is there a more straightforward way?\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate New Dimensions Individually:**\n   - **Pros:** Straightforward; apply the changes step by step.\n   - **Cons:** Could get messy with multiple calculations; prone to errors if not careful.\n\n2. **Use Ratios to Simplify:**\n   - **Pros:** Leverages the concept that volume changes with the product of base area and height; might simplify calculations.\n   - **Cons:** Requires a clear understanding of how each dimension affects the volume; could be abstract at first.\n\n3. **Dimensional Analysis:**\n   - **Pros:** Analyzing how dimensions scale can directly lead to the new volume ratio.\n   - **Cons:** Might be too theoretical; need to ensure understanding of application.\n\nReflection: Given these options, I think starting with calculating the new dimensions individually might be the most intuitive. If it gets too cumbersome, I can reconsider using ratios or dimensional analysis.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the New Base Dimensions**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI know that the base of the pyramid is rectangular. The problem states that:\n- The **length** of the base is doubled.\n- The **width** of the base is tripled.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI need to express these changes mathematically. But first, I realize I don't have the original dimensions, so I'll denote them as \\( L \\) (length) and \\( W \\) (width). This feels a bit abstract, but I think it's necessary to proceed.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Original Length:** \\( L \\)\n- **New Length:** \\( 2L \\)\n- **Original Width:** \\( W \\)\n- **New Width:** \\( 3W \\)\n\nWait, does it make sense to use variables like this without knowing the actual numbers? Hmm, maybe I should just keep it abstract for now.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes it align with the problem statement? Yes, it does. So, let's move on.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Original Volume**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe original volume of the pyramid is given as 40 cubic inches. I remember that:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} \\]\n\nBut since we don't have the height or the original base area, I wonder if I need to calculate anything specific at this moment.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nActually, the exact values of \\( L \\), \\( W \\), and height (\\( H \\)) aren't necessary since we're dealing with ratios. The volume before changes is already provided.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, we can proceed without knowing the individual dimensions.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the New Height**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe problem states that the height of the pyramid is increased by 50%. I need to express this change in terms of the original height.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Original Height:** \\( H \\)\n- **New Height:** \\( H + 0.5H = 1.5H \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems straightforward. The height increases by 50%, so it's now 1.5 times the original height.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this align with the problem? Yes, it does. Moving on.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Volume of the New Pyramid**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to calculate the volume of the new pyramid using the new dimensions. Recall the volume formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} \\]\n\nBut I don't have the exact base area. However, I can use the fact that the base area is proportional to the length and width.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nInstead of calculating the new volume directly, I could find the ratio of the new volume to the original volume based on how the dimensions change. This might simplify things.\n\n### **Exploring Alternative Strategy: Using Volume Ratios**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe volume of a pyramid is directly proportional to the base area and the height. Therefore, the changes in dimensions will affect the volume by the product of these changes.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Change in Base Area:** The length is doubled and the width is tripled, so:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Factor} = 2 \\times 3 = 6\n  \\]\n\n  This means the base area increases by a factor of 6.\n\n- **Change in Height:** The height increases by 50%, so:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Factor} = 1.5\n  \\]\n\n**Combined Effect on Volume:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Volume Factor} = 6 \\times 1.5 = 9\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute. The volume increases by a factor of 9? That seems significant. Let me double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Check:**  \n- **Base Area Change:** Doubling length and tripling width makes sense\u20142 times 3 is 6.\n- **Height Change:** Increasing by 50% is correctly represented as 1.5.\n\nYes, the calculations align. So, the volume indeed increases by a factor of 9.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the New Volume**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince the original volume is 40 cubic inches, and the volume increases by a factor of 9, I can calculate the new volume as:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{new}} = 40 \\times 9 = 360 \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems reasonable. The original volume is small, and with the significant increases in base area and height, a new volume of 360 cubic inches makes sense.\n\n**Check:**  \n- **Factor Calculation:** 6 (base area) \u00d7 1.5 (height) = 9.  \n- **Multiplication:** 40 \u00d7 9 = 360.  \n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nLooking back at the entire process:\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Starting with calculating new dimensions individually helped establish a clear path.\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Considering volume ratios simplified the calculation and provided a quick verification.\n- **Checks Throughout:** Regular checks ensured each step made sense and aligned with the problem statement.\n\nIn conclusion, the volume of the new pyramid is **360 cubic inches**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe volume of the new pyramid is **360 cubic inches**.\n\nI hope this step-by-step approach, complete with brainstorming, reflection, and checks, mirrors a natural human thought process while solving the problem.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the volume of a pyramid is linear in each of length, width, and height (in particular, $V = \\frac{1}{3} lwh$), multiplying any of these dimensions by a scalar multiplies the volume by the same scalar.  So the new volume is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 1.50 = 9$ times the old one, or $\\boxed{360}$ cubic inches."
