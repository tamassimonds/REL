    "working_out": "### Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it myself. When I first read the question, I see it's about selecting three people from a group of seven men and three women, and I need to find the probability that **at least one** woman is selected. \n\n**First thoughts:**\n- **At least one woman:** This reminds me of probability problems where it's easier to calculate the complement\u2014i.e., the probability of the opposite event\u2014and then subtract from 1.\n- **Total group composition:** There are 10 people in total (7 men and 3 women), so the sample space is relatively small.\n- **Combination calculations:** Since we're dealing with a specific number of selections (choosing three people), combination formulas might come into play to calculate different possible groupings.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n1. **Calculate directly the probability of selecting at least one woman:** This would involve considering all possible combinations where at least one woman is included.\n2. **Use the complement rule:** Calculate the probability of selecting **no** women (only men) and subtract this from 1.\n3. **Simulate or list all possible combinations:** Although with a small group, listing all combinations is feasible, it might be labor-intensive.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n- **Direct Calculation:** Looks straightforward but might get messy considering multiple cases (one woman, two women, or three women).\n- **Complement Probability:** Seems promising because calculating the probability of selecting no women simplifies the problem significantly.\n- **Enumerate All Possibilities:** This could work but might be unnecessary given the complement method's effectiveness.\n\n**Choosing a Strategy:**\nI think the **complement probability** method is the most efficient. It reduces the complexity by focusing on the easier scenario (selecting only men) and leverages that to find the desired probability.\n\n### Step 1: Calculating the Total Number of Ways to Select Three People\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo find probabilities, I need to know the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, it's the number of ways to select three people out of ten.\n\n**Calculation:**\nUse the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( n = 10 \\) (total people)\n- \\( k = 3 \\) (people to select)\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, there are **120** different ways to select three people from ten. This number will be the denominator in our probability calculations.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Number of Favorable Outcomes Where No Women Are Selected\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need to find the number of ways to select three people where **all are men**. This is the complement scenario we're interested in.\n\n**Calculation:**\nThere are 7 men in the group, so we need to calculate the number of ways to select three men out of seven.\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOnly **35** combinations exist where all selected individuals are men. This seems much smaller than the total, which makes sense since we're narrowing down to all-male groups.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Probability of Selecting No Women\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe probability of selecting no women is the number of favorable outcomes (all men) divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{No women}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of all-male combinations}}{\\text{Total number of combinations}} = \\frac{35}{120}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nSimplify the fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{35}{120} = \\frac{7}{24}\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of selecting no women is **\\(\\frac{7}{24}\\)**.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis probability seems reasonable\u2014it's less than 1, fitting within the expected range for a probability. However, I need to ensure that the complement method is the right approach by checking the next steps.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Probability of Selecting At Least One Woman\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince we're dealing with the complement, the probability of selecting at least one woman is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{At least one woman}) = 1 - P(\\text{No women}) = 1 - \\frac{7}{24}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{24}{24} - \\frac{7}{24} = \\frac{17}{24}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait, let me double-check that subtraction:\n\\[\n1 = \\frac{24}{24}, \\quad \\frac{24}{24} - \\frac{7}{24} = \\frac{24 - 7}{24} = \\frac{17}{24}\n\\]\nYes, that looks correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe probability of selecting at least one woman is **\\(\\frac{17}{24}\\)**. This response feels right because it accounts for all possible ways to select at least one woman by subtracting the all-male scenario from the total.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Approach\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIt's essential to ensure that the complement method is valid here. Let's briefly consider if directly calculating the probability of selecting one, two, or all three women would yield the same result.\n\n**Alternative Calculation:**\n1. **Probability of selecting exactly one woman:**\n   - Choose 1 woman from 3: \\(\\binom{3}{1} = 3\\)\n   - Choose 2 men from 7: \\(\\binom{7}{2} = 21\\)\n   - Total for this case: \\(3 \\times 21 = 63\\)\n\n2. **Probability of selecting exactly two women:**\n   - Choose 2 women from 3: \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\)\n   - Choose 1 man from 7: \\(\\binom{7}{1} = 7\\)\n   - Total for this case: \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\)\n\n3. **Probability of selecting exactly three women:**\n   - Choose 3 women from 3: \\(\\binom{3}{3} = 1\\)\n   - No men needed: \\(\\binom{7}{0} = 1\\)\n   - Total for this case: \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n\n**Adding These Together:**\n\\[\n63 + 21 + 1 = 85\n\\]\n\n**Probability Calculation:**\n\\[\nP(\\text{At least one woman}) = \\frac{85}{120} = \\frac{17}{24}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nBoth methods yield the same probability, **\\(\\frac{17}{24}\\)**. This confirms that the complement method was correct and verifies the accuracy of the solution.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the calculations, the probability that at least one woman is selected when choosing three people from the group is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{17}{24}}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy brainstorming various approaches, selecting the most efficient complement probability method, and checking each step along the way, I've ensured that the solution is accurate and reliable. This step-by-step reflection and verification process is crucial in tackling probability problems effectively.",

  "ground_truth": "We can find the probability that no women are selected and subtract it from 1 to find the probability that at least one woman is selected. To find the probability that only men are selected, we consider that the chance that the first person selected is male is $\\frac{7}{10}$. Then the probability that the second person selected is male is reduced to $\\frac{6}{9}=\\frac{2}{3}$. For the third person, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8}$. So the probability that only men are selected is $$\\frac{7}{10}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{5}{8}=\\frac{7}{24}.$$ Notice that the 2 and 5 in the numerator cancel with the 10 in the denominator to leave $\\frac{7}{24}$. Now we subtract from 1 to find the probability that at least one woman is selected. The probability is $1-\\frac{7}{24}=\\boxed{\\frac{17}{24}}$."
