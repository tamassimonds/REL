    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nI immediately think it involves multiplying fractions. Multiplying fractions is something I've done before, but I'm not entirely sure if there's a trick or pattern I can exploit here. My initial reaction is to multiply all the numerators and denominators straight across. But before committing, I wonder if there's a simpler way by canceling common factors.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Direct Multiplication:** Multiply all numerators together and all denominators together.\n2. **Canceling Common Factors:** Look for numerators and denominators that can simplify before multiplying.\n3. **Pattern Recognition:** See if there's a pattern in the fractions that might simplify the process.\n\nHmm, let's explore these options starting with direct multiplication.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting Direct Multiplication**\n\nLet's try multiplying the fractions straight across:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{Numerators \\times Numerators}{Denominators \\times Denominators}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nNumerators:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 120\n\\]\n\nDenominators:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 360\n\\]\n\nSo, the combined fraction is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120}{360}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute. Both the numerator and denominator can be simplified. Let me reduce this fraction to see if it matches an expected simple fraction.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120 \\div 120}{360 \\div 120} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) make sense for this problem? Let's see if there's a simpler way that might lead to this same answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering Alternative Strategies**\n\nEven though direct multiplication worked, I remember that canceling common factors can often simplify the process and reduce the chance of calculation errors. Let me explore this strategy to see if it confirms the same result more efficiently.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Canceling Common Factors**\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nI notice:\n\n- The \\(3\\) in the numerator of the second fraction can cancel with the \\(3\\) in the denominator of the first fraction.\n- Similarly, the \\(4\\) in the numerator of the third fraction can cancel with the \\(4\\) in the denominator of the second fraction.\n- The \\(5\\) in the numerator of the fourth fraction can cancel with the \\(5\\) in the denominator of the third fraction.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThis looks like a telescoping pattern where most terms cancel out. Let's see if this works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Cancelling Strategy**\n\nLet's apply the cancellation step by step:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{5}{6} \\]\\\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{2 \\times \\cancel{3} \\times \\cancel{4} \\times \\cancel{5}}{\\cancel{3} \\times \\cancel{4} \\times \\cancel{5} \\times 6}\n\\]\n\nThe cancellation simplifies it to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis is much simpler! Now, let's reduce \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\div 2}{6 \\div 2} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nSo, both methods\u2014direct multiplication and canceling common factors\u2014yield the same result: \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). This consistency gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\nTo ensure that \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) is indeed the correct answer, let's quickly check if the cancellations were valid and if the calculations were correct throughout.\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\n- **Canceling Common Factors:**\n  - \\(3\\) in the second fraction cancels with \\(3\\) in the first fraction.\n  - \\(4\\) in the third fraction cancels with \\(4\\) in the second fraction.\n  - \\(5\\) in the fourth fraction cancels with \\(5\\) in the third fraction.\n\nThis leaves us with:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nDoes \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) make sense in the context of multiplying these fractions? Given that each fraction is less than 1 and the numerators and denominators have been systematically canceled, \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) seems plausible.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014both direct multiplication and canceling common factors\u2014and verifying each step, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]\n\nBy reflecting frequently, checking work along the way, and being open to adjusting the approach, I've ensured that the solution is correct and well-validated.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed, step-by-step walk-through mirrors the human thought process, complete with brainstorming, reflection, and verification, making it clear how the solution was reached.",
