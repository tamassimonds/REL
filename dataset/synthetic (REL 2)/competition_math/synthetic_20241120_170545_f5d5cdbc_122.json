    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about the rectangle's perimeter, dimensions, and diagonal length. I'll walk through my brainstorming process, explore different strategies, reflect, and adjust as needed\u2014just like how I would tackle it in real life.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, off the bat, here's what I see:\n\n- **Perimeter** of the rectangle is given as **56 meters**.\n- There's a **ratio** between the length and width of the rectangle, specifically **4:3**.\n- The goal is to find the **length of the diagonal** in meters.\n\nAt first glance, this **reminds me** of problems where you deal with proportions and the Pythagorean theorem. I remember dealing with perimeters and ratios before, but it's been a while\u2014let's see how it goes.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**\n   - I know the perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n     \\[\n     P = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width})\n     \\]\n   - Maybe I can set up an equation using this and the given ratio.\n\n2. **Express Length and Width in Terms of Each Other:**\n   - Since the ratio is 4:3, I could express the length as \\( 4x \\) and the width as \\( 3x \\) where \\( x \\) is a common multiplier.\n\n3. **Set Up a System of Equations:**\n   - With the perimeter equation and the ratio, I might be able to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Diagonal Using Pythagoras:**\n   - Once I have the length and width, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal.\n\nBut before proceeding, **let me check** if this approach makes sense. The perimeter formula should work, and using ratios to express length and width seems logical. If the numbers start to look off later, I'll know to adjust.\n\n### **Step 1: Express Length and Width Using the Ratio**\n\nLet's assign variables based on the ratio:\n\n- **Length (\\( L \\))** = \\( 4x \\)\n- **Width (\\( W \\))** = \\( 3x \\)\n\nThis makes sense because the ratio \\( L:W = 4:3 \\). So, \\( L \\) is four parts, and \\( W \\) is three parts of some common unit \\( x \\).\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nDoes this look correct? **Yes**, because multiplying \\( x \\) by 4 gives the length and by 3 gives the width, maintaining the ratio.\n\n### **Step 2: Set Up the Perimeter Equation**\n\nNow, plug these expressions into the perimeter formula:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (L + W) = 56\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( L \\) and \\( W \\):\n\n\\[\n2 \\times (4x + 3x) = 56\n\\]\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 7x = 56\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nWait a second\u2014**7x** times 2 equals 14x, so:\n\n\\[\n14x = 56\n\\]\n\nThis seems right. Nothing off here.\n\n### **Step 3: Solve for \\( x \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s divide both sides by 14 to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{56}{14} = 4\n\\]\n\n### **Check:**\n\nDoes this division look correct? **Yes**, because \\( 56 \\div 14 = 4 \\).\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate Length and Width**\n\nNow that we have \\( x = 4 \\), let's find the actual dimensions:\n\n- **Length (\\( L \\))** = \\( 4x = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\) meters\n- **Width (\\( W \\))** = \\( 3x = 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\) meters\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n**Hmm**, 16 meters for the length and 12 meters for the width\u2014**that fits** the 4:3 ratio (16 is four-thirds of 12). The numbers seem reasonable.\n\n### **Step 5: Verify the Perimeter**\n\nJust to make sure:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times (16 + 12) = 2 \\times 28 = 56\n\\]\n\nThe perimeter checks out\u2014**good**!\n\n### **Step 6: Calculate the Diagonal Using Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nNow, let's find the diagonal (\\( d \\)):\n\n\\[\nd^2 = L^2 + W^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nd^2 = 16^2 + 12^2 = 256 + 144 = 400\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{400} = 20 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nSo the diagonal is 20 meters. **Does this make sense?** Using the Pythagorean theorem here seems appropriate since we're dealing with a rectangle. The numbers add up.\n\n### **Final Check:**\n\n- Perimeter matches the given value.\n- Length and width maintain the 4:3 ratio.\n- Diagonal calculation is consistent with the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nEverything checks out. The approach worked well, and the final answer feels correct.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully setting up the perimeter equation using the given ratio, solving for the common multiplier, and then applying the Pythagorean theorem, I've determined that the diagonal of the rectangle is **20 meters**.\n\nThroughout the process, I brainstormed different strategies, reflected on each step, and verified the calculations to ensure accuracy. This methodical approach helped confirm the correctness of the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe length of the diagonal of the rectangle is **20 meters**.",
