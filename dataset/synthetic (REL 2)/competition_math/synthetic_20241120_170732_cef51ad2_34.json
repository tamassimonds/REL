    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: \n\n\\[ \\sqrt{12 + \\sqrt{12 + \\sqrt{12 + \\sqrt{12 + \\cdots}}}} \\]\n\n## **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts: \n\n- **Infinite Nested Square Roots:** This expression involves an infinite nesting of square roots. It reminds me of previous problems I've encountered where setting up an equation helps in finding the value.\n- **Convergence:** I wonder if this expression converges to a specific value. Infinity suggests that perhaps the inner expressions settle at some fixed point.\n- **Possible Approaches:** Maybe I can set the entire expression equal to some variable and solve for it. Alternatively, I could look for patterns or consider squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots.\n\nLet me brainstorm:\n\n- **Setting Up an Equation:** Let\u2019s say the entire expression equals \\( x \\). Then, \\( x = \\sqrt{12 + x} \\). This feels like a solid starting point.\n- **Exploring Other Strategies:** I could try squaring both sides of the equation to simplify, or perhaps check if there's a geometric or recursive pattern.\n- **Checking for Simplification:** Before diving deeper, seeing if squaring straight away helps might be worthwhile.\n\n## **Step 2: Initial Approach - Setting the Expression Equal to \\( x \\)**\n\nLet's go with the first idea:\n\nAssume:\n\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{12 + x} \\]\n\nThought process:\n\n- **Reflecting on This Assumption:** It feels logical since if the expression converges, then replacing the infinite nesting with \\( x \\) should hold true.\n- **Potential Issue:** I need to ensure this assumption doesn\u2019t lead to extraneous solutions, but it seems straightforward.\n\n## **Step 3: Solving the Equation by Squaring Both Sides**\n\nNow, let's square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 12 + x\n\\]\n\nThoughts:\n\n- **Checking if This Is Correct:** Squaring should work since both sides are positive in this context.\n- **Rearranging the Equation:** Let\u2019s move all terms to one side.\n\n\\[\nx^2 - x - 12 = 0\n\\]\n\n## **Step 4: Factoring the Quadratic Equation**\n\nAt this point, I recognize that I need to factor the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - x - 12 = 0\n\\]\n\nThoughts:\n\n- **Looking for Two Numbers That Multiply to \\(-12\\) and Add to \\(-1\\):** \n  - Possible pairs are: \\(3 \\times -4 = -12\\) and \\(3 + (-4) = -1\\).\n- **Factoring the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n(x - 4)(x + 3) = 0\n\\]\n\nReflection:\n\n- **Checking Factorization:** This seems correct. Let\u2019s solve for \\( x \\).\n\n## **Step 5: Solving for \\( x \\)**\n\nSetting each factor to zero:\n\n\\[\nx - 4 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 4\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 3 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -3\n\\]\n\nThoughts:\n\n- **Interpreting the Solutions:** Since \\( x \\) represents a length (the value of the square root expression), it must be positive.\n- **Discarding Negative Solution:** \\( x = -3 \\) doesn't make sense in this context, so we discard it.\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nx = 4\n\\]\n\n## **Step 6: Verifying the Solution**\n\nLet\u2019s quickly check if \\( x = 4 \\) satisfies the original equation:\n\n\\[\n4 = \\sqrt{12 + 4}\n\\]\n\\[\n4 = \\sqrt{16}\n\\]\n\\[\n4 = 4 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n\\]\n\nThoughts:\n\n- **Verification Step:** This confirms that \\( x = 4 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n## **Step 7: Reassessing the Approach**\n\nReflecting on the method:\n\n- **Was Setting \\( x \\) Correct?** Yes, assuming the entire expression equals \\( x \\) was a logical and effective strategy.\n- **Did Squaring Work Properly?** Squaring both sides helped eliminate the square root, leading to a solvable quadratic equation.\n- **Could There Be Another Method?** While this method is straightforward, I wonder if there are alternative approaches like using limits or recognizing patterns. However, the current method is clear and direct.\n\n## **Step 8: Exploring Alternative Strategies (Just for Exploration)**\n\nAlthough the initial method worked well, let me brainstorm other possible strategies:\n\n1. **Recursive Definition:**\n   - Define the infinite sequence: \\( a_1 = \\sqrt{12} \\), \\( a_2 = \\sqrt{12 + a_1} \\), and so on.\n   - Compute a few terms to see if they converge to a specific value.\n\n2. **Numerical Approximation:**\n   - Use numerical methods or computational tools to approximate the value.\n\n3. **Graphical Interpretation:**\n   - Graph the function \\( y = \\sqrt{12 + x} \\) and \\( y = x \\) to find their intersection.\n\nThoughts:\n\n- **Recursive Definition:** This would lead back to the same equation we solved, confirming our result.\n- **Numerical Approximation:** Could provide a quick check, but isn\u2019t necessary since we have an exact solution.\n- **Graphical Interpretation:** Would visually confirm that \\( x = 4 \\) is the point of intersection.\n\n## **Step 9: Final Reflection**\n\nFinal check:\n\n- **Does the Solution Make Sense?** Yes, \\( x = 4 \\) satisfies the original equation and aligns with the properties of square roots.\n- **Is the Approach Valid?** Each step logically follows the previous one, ensuring the correctness of the solution.\n- **Would Other Methods Yield Different Results?** Alternative methods would likely arrive at the same conclusion, but our initial approach was efficient and straightforward.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThrough setting up an equation to represent the infinite nested square roots, solving the resulting quadratic equation, and verifying the solution, we confidently arrive at:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\nThis detailed step-by-step process, reflecting on each stage, checking the validity of approaches, and exploring alternative strategies, ensures a comprehensive and accurate solution to the problem.",

  "ground_truth": "Letting $x= \\!\\sqrt{12 +\\!\\sqrt{12 + \\!\\sqrt{12 + \\!\\sqrt{12 + \\cdots}}}}$, we have $x = \\!\\sqrt{12 + x}$.  Squaring both sides gives $x^2 = 12+x$, so $x^2 -x-12 = 0$.  Factoring the left side gives $(x-4)(x+3) = 0$. Therefore, $x=4$ or $x=-3$.  Clearly $x$ must be positive, so we have $x= \\boxed{4}$."
