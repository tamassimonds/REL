    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my approaches, check my work frequently, and adjust my methods as needed. Let's see where this takes us!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see it's about planning a trip with three legs:\n\n1. From **A to B**\n2. From **B to C**\n3. From **C to A**\n\nEach leg can be by **bus** or **airplane**, and there are costs associated with each mode of transport. The cities form a right-angled triangle with known distances between them.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Transportation Costs:** Understand the cost per kilometer for bus and airplane, including fixed fees.\n- **Triangular Distances:** Since the cities are at the vertices of a right triangle, maybe I need to determine all side lengths or just the given ones.\n- **Total Distance Calculation:** Sum up the distances for each leg of the trip.\n- **Cost Comparison:** Determine which mode is cheaper for each leg.\n  \nI'm not entirely sure where to start, but I think calculating the **total distance** traveled is the first logical step. From there, I can explore how to minimize costs by choosing the appropriate mode of transport for each leg.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Triangle's Dimensions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to find the total distance Piravena travels. Since the question provides distances between certain points and mentions a right-angled triangle, it's essential to ensure I have all required distances.\n\n**Given:**\n\n- Distance **AC** = 3000 km\n- Distance **AB** = 3250 km\n- Triangle **ABC** is right-angled at **B**\n\n**Checking if All Sides Are Known:**\n\nWait, I only have two sides (AC and AB) and noe the angle, but since it's a right triangle, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the third side **BC**.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nBut before that, I notice the labeling: If **AC = 3000 km** and **AB = 3250 km**, then **BC** should be the remaining side.\n\nSince it's a right triangle:\n\n\\[ AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2 \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ (3000 \\, \\text{km})^2 + BC^2 = (3250 \\, \\text{km})^2 \\]\n\\[ 9,000,000 + BC^2 = 10,562,500 \\]\n\\[ BC^2 = 10,562,500 - 9,000,000 \\]\n\\[ BC^2 = 1,562,500 \\]\n\\[ BC = \\sqrt{1,562,500} \\approx 1250 \\, \\text{km} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, are these numbers adding up correctly? Let's quickly check:\n\n- \\(3000^2 = 9,000,000\\)\n- \\(3250^2 = 10,562,500\\)\n- Difference: \\(10,562,500 - 9,000,000 = 1,562,500\\)\n- \\( \\sqrt{1,562,500} = 1250\\)\n\nLooks good! So, **BC = 1250 km**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Total Distance Traveled**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have all three sides of the triangle, the total distance Piravena travels is simply the sum of the lengths of each leg:\n\n1. **A to B:** 3250 km\n2. **B to C:** 1250 km\n3. **C to A:** 3000 km\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nTotal Distance \\( D \\):\n\n\\[ D = AB + BC + CA \\]\n\\[ D = 3250 \\, \\text{km} + 1250 \\, \\text{km} + 3000 \\, \\text{km} \\]\n\\[ D = 7500 \\, \\text{km} \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Just adding the three sides of the triangle makes sense. But let me double-check by recalling the journey's path: A to B, B to C, and C to A. Yep, adding those distances aligns with the right triangle's sides.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Transportation Options to Minimize Cost**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I know the total distance is 7500 km, the next step is to figure out the most cost-effective way to travel each leg. This involves comparing the costs of taking a bus versus an airplane for each segment.\n\n**Given Costs:**\n\n- **Bus:** \\$0.15 per kilometer\n- **Airplane:** \\$100 booking fee + \\$0.10 per kilometer\n\nI need to calculate and compare the total cost for both modes for each leg.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. **Calculate Costs for Each Leg:**\n   - Determine the cost for bus and airplane for each leg.\n   \n2. **Choose the Cheaper Option for Each Leg:**\n   - Select the mode with the lower cost for each part of the trip.\n\n**Wait a Moment:**\n\nHmm, before diving into individual leg calculations, I'm realizing that there's a fixed booking fee for airplanes. So, for shorter distances where the bus cost is lower, it might be better to take the bus instead of an airplane to avoid the fixed fee.\n\n**Reconsidering Strategy:**\n\nShould I calculate costs for each mode individually, or is there a better way? Maybe comparing the cost per kilometer directly could save time, especially since the booking fee is a flat rate.\n\nBut the problem specifies comparing both modes for each leg, so I'll proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating Costs for Each Leg**\n\n**Leg 1: A to B (3250 km)**\n\n**Bus Cost:**\n\\[ \\text{Cost}_{\\text{bus}} = 3250 \\, \\text{km} \\times 0.15 \\, \\text{USD/km} = 487.5 \\, \\text{USD} \\]\n\n**Airplane Cost:**\n\\[ \\text{Cost}_{\\text{airplane}} = 100 \\, \\text{USD} + (3250 \\, \\text{km} \\times 0.10 \\, \\text{USD/km}) = 100 + 325 = 425 \\, \\text{USD} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, the airplane is cheaper for this leg! That's interesting because typically, buses are more economical for longer distances, but the fixed booking fee for airplanes makes them cheaper in this case.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n**Airplane** is the cheaper option for **A to B**.\n\n---\n\n**Leg 2: B to C (1250 km)**\n\n**Bus Cost:**\n\\[ \\text{Cost}_{\\text{bus}} = 1250 \\, \\text{km} \\times 0.15 \\, \\text{USD/km} = 187.5 \\, \\text{USD} \\]\n\n**Airplane Cost:**\n\\[ \\text{Cost}_{\\text{airplane}} = 100 \\, \\text{USD} + (1250 \\, \\text{km} \\times 0.10 \\, \\text{USD/km}) = 100 + 125 = 225 \\, \\text{USD} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis time, the bus is cheaper. The fixed booking fee for airplanes makes them less economical for shorter distances.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n**Bus** is the cheaper option for **B to C**.\n\n---\n\n**Leg 3: C to A (3000 km)**\n\n**Bus Cost:**\n\\[ \\text{Cost}_{\\text{bus}} = 3000 \\, \\text{km} \\times 0.15 \\, \\text{USD/km} = 450 \\, \\text{USD} \\]\n\n**Airplane Cost:**\n\\[ \\text{Cost}_{\\text{airplane}} = 100 \\, \\text{USD} + (3000 \\, \\text{km} \\times 0.10 \\, \\text{USD/km}) = 100 + 300 = 400 \\, \\text{USD} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow the airplane is cheaper again. It seems that for longer distances, the fixed fee is offset by the lower per-kilometer rate of airplanes.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n**Airplane** is the cheaper option for **C to A**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Tallied Costs and Final Reflection**\n\n**Total Cost Calculation:**\n\n- **Leg 1 (A to B):** Airplane = 425 USD\n- **Leg 2 (B to C):** Bus = 187.5 USD\n- **Leg 3 (C to A):** Airplane = 400 USD\n\n**Wait, Let Me Add Them Up:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = 425 + 187.5 + 400 = 1012.5 \\, \\text{USD} \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this total make sense? Looking back, each leg's cost was calculated based on the given per-kilometer rates and distances. The airplane's fixed fee was correctly applied where necessary.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe total cost seems reasonable. The strategy of calculating costs for each leg individually ensured that the cheapest mode was selected for each part of the trip. I briefly considered whether there's a more efficient method, like calculating the overall cost per kilometer for each mode, but given the fixed booking fee, treating each leg separately was appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying Approach and Answer**\n\n**Checking Assumptions:**\n\nDid I correctly identify the transportation costs?\n- **Bus:** \\$0.15/km\n- **Airplane:** \\$100 plus \\$0.10/km\n\nYes, those values were consistently applied.\n\n**Ensuring All Distances Are Included:**\n\nDid I account for all three legs of the trip?\n- **A to B:** 3250 km\n- **B to C:** 1250 km\n- **C to A:** 3000 km\n\nYep, all legs were considered.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything seems to align. The approach was methodical, starting with calculating the total distance, followed by analyzing the cost for each leg, and finally summing up the cheapest options.\n\n**Final Insight:**\n\nBy comparing the costs for buses and airplanes on each leg, Piravena can minimize her travel expenses to **\\$1012.50**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**The total distance Piravena travels is ** **7500 km.**\n\n**Ahh, Got It!**\n\nSo, after brainstorming and exploring different strategies, I confirmed that the total distance traveled is straightforward\u2014just the sum of all legs. By analyzing the costs for buses and airplanes individually for each leg, I determined that the most economical choice minimizes her total expenditure to **\\$1012.50**. Reflecting throughout helped ensure that no leg was overlooked and that the cost calculations were accurate.",
