    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it step by step. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work as I go.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the question, we have:\n\n- **Point \\( A = (1,1) \\)** on the parabola \\( y = x^2 \\).\n- The **normal** to the parabola at \\( A \\) is drawn, intersecting the parabola again at \\( B \\).\n- We need to find the coordinates of \\( B \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Parabola Basics:** I remember that the normal line is related to the tangent line. So maybe I should find the equation of the tangent line at \\( A \\) first.\n  \n- **Normal Line:** The normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line. Once I have the tangent line, I can find the normal line.\n  \n- **Intersection Point \\( B \\):** To find \\( B \\), I need to find where this normal line intersects the parabola again.\n  \n- **Quadratic Equation:** Since the parabola is defined by \\( y = x^2 \\), I might end up with a quadratic equation when finding the intersection.\n\nDoes this approach seem reasonable? Let\u2019s see if it leads us somewhere.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Find the Equation of the Tangent Line at \\( A \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the tangent line at a point \\( A \\) on the parabola, I need the derivative \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} \\) at that point.\n  \n- For the parabola \\( y = x^2 \\), I recall that the derivative \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x \\).\n\n- At \\( A = (1,1) \\), the slope of the tangent line would be \\( 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Point-Slope Form:** The equation of the tangent line can be written using the point-slope form:  \n  \n  \\[\n  y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n  \\]\n  \n  where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) is the point \\( A \\).\n\n- Plugging in the values:  \n \n  \\[\n  y - 1 = 2(x - 1)\n  \\]\n  \n  Simplifying: \n  \n  \\[\n  y = 2x - 1\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this look correct? The slope seems reasonable for a parabola opening upwards. Plus, the point-slope form matches the given point \\( A \\). I think this is right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Equation of the Normal Line at \\( A \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line. Therefore, its slope will be the negative reciprocal of the tangent line\u2019s slope.\n\n- Since the slope of the tangent line is \\( 2 \\), the slope of the normal line is \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Using Point-Slope Form Again:**  \n \n  \\[\n  y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n  \\]\n  \n  where \\( m = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( (x_1, y_1) = (1,1) \\).\n\n- Plugging in the values:  \n \n  \\[\n  y - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2}(x - 1)\n  \\]\n  \n  Simplifying: \n  \n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense. The slope being negative means it's perpendicular to the tangent line\u2019s slope. I think this is a correct representation of the normal line.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Find the Intersection Point \\( B \\) on the Parabola**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find \\( B \\), I need to determine where the normal line intersects the parabola again.\n\n- The parabola is given by \\( y = x^2 \\). I can substitute the equation of the normal line into this to find the intersection points.\n\n- Since I already know one point of intersection is \\( A = (1,1) \\), I should expect to find another point \\( B \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Substitute \\( y = x^2 \\) into the normal line equation:**  \n  \n  \\[\n  x^2 = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Rearrange the equation:**  \n  \n  \\[\n  x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2} = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:**  \n  \n  \\[\n  2x^2 + x - 3 = 0\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks like it\u2019s set up correctly. I\u2019ve transformed the problem into solving a quadratic equation. Let\u2019s move on to solving it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solve the Quadratic Equation for \\( x \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I need to factor or use the quadratic formula to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n- The quadratic equation is \\( 2x^2 + x - 3 = 0 \\).\n\n- Let\u2019s check if it\u2019s factorable first; if not, I\u2019ll use the quadratic formula.\n\n**Checking for Factoring:**\n\n- **Look for two numbers that multiply to \\( 2 \\times -3 = -6 \\)** and add up to \\( 1 \\). \n\n- Possible pairs: \\( (3, -2) \\)\n\n  - But multiplying \\( 3 \\) and \\( -2 \\) gives \\( -6 \\), and adding \\( 3 \\) and \\( -2 \\) equals \\( 1 \\). So, it seems like it can be factored.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Factoring the Quadratic:**  \n  \n  \\[\n  2x^2 + 3x - 2x - 3 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  Grouping terms:\n  \n  \\[\n  x(2x + 3) - 1(2x + 3) = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  Factoring out \\( (2x + 3) \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  (2x + 3)(x - 1) = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solving for \\( x \\):**  \n  \n  \\[\n  2x + 3 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 1 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  x = -\\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 1\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, I already knew \\( x = 1 \\) corresponds to point \\( A \\). The other solution \\( x = -\\frac{3}{2} \\) should give me the \\( x \\)-coordinate of point \\( B \\). This seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Find the \\( y \\)-coordinate of \\( B \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have the \\( x \\)-coordinate of \\( B \\) as \\( x = -\\frac{3}{2} \\), I can find the corresponding \\( y \\)-coordinate by substituting back into the parabola equation \\( y = x^2 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Substitute \\( x = -\\frac{3}{2} \\) into \\( y = x^2 \\):**  \n  \n  \\[\n  y = \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{4}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Coordinates of \\( B \\):**  \n  \n  \\[\n  B = \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{9}{4}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe calculations seem straightforward. Squaring \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\) gives \\( \\frac{9}{4} \\), which fits the parabola equation. I think this is right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verify the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- It\u2019s always a good idea to double-check that the point \\( B \\) lies on both the normal line and the parabola.\n\n- Let\u2019s ensure that \\( \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{9}{4}\\right) \\) satisfies the equation of the normal line.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Substitute \\( x = -\\frac{3}{2} \\) into the normal line equation \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{2} \\):**  \n  \n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{9}{4}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** The \\( y \\)-coordinate matches \\( \\frac{9}{4} \\), so the point lies on the normal line.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis confirms that \\( B \\) is indeed on the normal line and the parabola. Everything checks out, so I\u2019m confident in the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming and systematically solving the problem:\n\n- The point \\( B \\) where the normal line intersects the parabola again is  \n  \n  \\[\n  B = \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{9}{4}\\right)\n  \\]\n\nThroughout the process, I:\n\n- Started by identifying the need to find the tangent and normal lines at point \\( A \\).\n- Solved for the intersection of the normal line with the parabola by setting up and solving a quadratic equation.\n- Verified the solution by ensuring point \\( B \\) lies on both the normal line and the parabola.\n\nBy reflecting and checking each step, I ensured the correctness of the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Then the equation of the tangent at $A = (1,1)$ is of the form\n\\[y - 1 = m(x - 1),\\]or $y = mx - m + 1.$  Substituting into $y = x^2,$ we get\n\\[mx - m + 1 = x^2.\\]Then $x^2 - mx + m - 1 = 0.$  Since we have a tangent, this quadratic should have a double root.  And since the $x$-coordinate of $A$ is $1,$ the double root is $x = 1.$  Hence, this quadratic is identical to $(x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1,$ which means $m = 2.$\n\nThen the slope of the normal is $-\\frac{1}{2},$ so the equation of the normal is\n\\[y - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2} (x - 1).\\]We want the intersection of the normal with $y = x^2,$ so we set $y = x^2$:\n\\[x^2 - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2} (x - 1).\\]We can factor the left-hand side:\n\\[(x - 1)(x + 1) = -\\frac{1}{2} (x - 1).\\]The solution $x = 1$ corresponds to the point $A.$  Otherwise, $x \\neq 1,$ so we can divide both sides by $x - 1$:\n\\[x + 1 = -\\frac{1}{2}.\\]Hence, $x = -\\frac{3}{2},$ so $B = \\boxed{\\left( -\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{9}{4} \\right)}.$"
