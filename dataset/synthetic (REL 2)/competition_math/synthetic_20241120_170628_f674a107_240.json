    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: **Evaluate \\(\\left\\lfloor -\\frac{5}{3}\\right\\rfloor\\).**\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\nWhen I first see this question, a few things pop into my mind:\n\n1. **Understanding the Floor Function:** \n   - I remember that the floor function \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). \n   - But here, it\u2019s negative, which makes me think about how negative numbers work with floor functions.\n\n2. **Dealing with Negative Fractions:**\n   - Handling negative fractions can be tricky. \n   - I recall that for negative numbers, the floor function rounds down towards more negative, not up towards zero.\n\n3. **Calculating the Decimal:**\n   - Maybe converting \\(-\\frac{5}{3}\\) to its decimal form could help.\n   - This would give me a better sense of where it lies on the number line.\n\n### **Exploring the First Strategy: Converting to Decimal**\n\nLet me try converting \\(-\\frac{5}{3}\\) into decimal form to see how it looks.\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{5}{3} = -1.6666\\ldots \\text{ (repeating)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Okay, so \\(-\\frac{5}{3}\\) is approximately \\(-1.67\\).\n- **Quick Check:** The decimal is between \\(-2\\) and \\(-1\\), closer to \\(-2\\). That hints that maybe the floor would be \\(-2\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since the floor function rounds down (towards more negative), I think the answer might be \\(-2\\).\n- But wait, let me double-check by considering the definition of the floor function.\n\n### **Verifying with the Floor Function Definition**\n\nAccording to the definition:\n\n- **Floor Function:** \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\) is the largest integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n \\leq x\\).\n\nSo for \\(x = -1.6666\\ldots\\):\n\n\\[\nn \\leq -1.6666\\ldots\n\\]\n\n**Possible Integers:**\n- The integers less than or equal to \\(-1.6666\\ldots\\) are \\(-2, -3, -4, \\ldots\\)\n- But \\(-2\\) is the largest integer that satisfies the condition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- This confirms that \\(\\left\\lfloor -\\frac{5}{3} \\right\\rfloor = -2\\).\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Number Line Approach**\n\nLet\u2019s visualize it on a number line to be sure.\n\n- **Number Line:** \\(-2, -1.5, -1, 0, 1, \\ldots\\)\n- \\(-\\frac{5}{3} = -1.6666\\ldots\\) lies between \\(-2\\) and \\(-1\\).\n- To find the floor, we need the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(-1.6666\\ldots\\), which is still \\(-2\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This visual approach reinforces the earlier conclusion.\n- **Check:** Does \\(-2 \\leq -1.6666\\ldots\\)? Yes, it does.\n\n### **Potential Pitfall: Misinterpretation of \u201cGreatest Integer\u201d**\n\nWait a moment\u2014could there be a common mistake here?\n\n- **Mistake:** Sometimes people might think \u201cgreatest\u201d means less negative, leading them to choose \\(-1\\).\n- **But:** According to the floor function definition, \u201cgreatest\u201d refers to the largest integer that still satisfies the inequality, which is more negative in this case.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The correct interpretation is crucial. \u201cGreatest integer less than or equal to \\(-1.6666\\ldots\\)\u201d is definitely \\(-2\\).\n\n### **Final Check: Re-evaluating the Approaches**\n\nBefore finalizing:\n\n- **Decimal Conversion:** \\(-1.6666\\ldots\\) indeed rounds down to \\(-2\\).\n- **Number Line:** Visually confirms that \\(-2\\) is the largest integer less than \\(-1.6666\\ldots\\).\n- **Definition Compliance:** All approaches align with the floor function\u2019s definition.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- All strategies point to the same answer: \\(-2\\).\n- **Random Insight:** It\u2019s reassuring when multiple methods converge on the same solution.\n\n### **Final Reflection: Confirming the Solution**\n\n- **Does the Answer Make Sense?** Yes, rounding \\(-1.6666\\ldots\\) down leads to \\(-2\\).\n- **Check Against Definition:** \\(-2\\) is indeed the largest integer less than or equal to \\(-1.6666\\ldots\\).\n- **Potential Mistakes Avoided:** Initially, the temptation to choose \\(-1\\) was there, but checking multiple strategies clarified the correct answer.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor -\\frac{5}{3} \\right\\rfloor = -2\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the Thought Process:**\n\n- **Brainstormed Strategies:** Decimal conversion, number line visualization, and definition verification.\n- **Explored and Reflected:** Each approach consistently pointed to \\(-2\\), confirming the correctness.\n- **Checked for Mistakes:** Ensured that the floor function was correctly interpreted, avoiding common pitfalls.\n- **Final Conclusion:** Multiple strategies validated that the floor of \\(-\\frac{5}{3}\\) is indeed \\(-2\\).\n\nBy thinking through it step-by-step, testing different methods, and constantly checking for accuracy, I\u2019m confident that the solution is correct.",
