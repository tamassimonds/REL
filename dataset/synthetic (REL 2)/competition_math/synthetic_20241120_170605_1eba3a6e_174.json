I'll walk through my thought process step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I think:\n\n- **Understanding Odd Divisors:** Okay, I need to find divisors of \\(180\\) that are odd. This makes me recall that odd numbers aren't divisible by \\(2\\).\n- **Focusing on Prime Factorization:** Maybe breaking \\(180\\) down into its prime factors would help me identify which divisors are odd.\n- **Listing Divisors as an Option:** Another approach is to list all divisors of \\(180\\) and then pick out the odd ones. But that seems a bit tedious without prime factorization.\n- **Recalling Divisor Properties:** I remember that the sum of divisors can be calculated using the formula involving prime factors. Perhaps I can leverage that here.\n\nAt this point, I'm leaning towards using **prime factorization** combined with the **divisor sum formula**. But let's explore this further to confirm.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Break down \\(180\\) into its prime factors to see which combinations are odd.\n   \n2. **Listing All Divisors:**\n   - Write out all divisors of \\(180\\) and filter for odd ones.\n   \n3. **Using the Divisor Sum Formula:**\n   - Apply the formula for the sum of divisors using the prime factorization.\n\nLet's start with **prime factorization** since it's more systematic and should lead me directly to the odd divisors.\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization of \\(180\\)**\n\nThinking it through:\n\n- I know \\(180\\) is an even number, so it must have \\(2\\) as a factor.\n- Let's divide \\(180\\) by \\(2\\):  \n  \\[\n  180 \\div 2 = 90\n  \\]\n- \\(90\\) is also even, so divide by \\(2\\) again:  \n  \\[\n  90 \\div 2 = 45\n  \\]\n- Now, \\(45\\) is odd, so I stop dividing by \\(2\\).\n- Next, I need to factor \\(45\\):  \n  \\[\n  45 \\div 3 = 15  \n  15 \\div 3 = 5  \n  5 \\div 5 = 1\n  \\]\n  \nSo, the prime factorization of \\(180\\) is:  \n\\[\n180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense because multiplying \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\\) gives \\(180\\). I feel confident about this step.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Odd Divisors**\n\nNow, I need to focus on the odd part of the prime factorization. Odd divisors are those that **do not** include the factor \\(2\\).\n\n- From \\(180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\\), if I remove \\(2^2\\), I'm left with:  \n  \\[\n  3^2 \\times 5^1\n  \\]\n  \n**Thought Process:**  \nBy removing all even factors (i.e., powers of \\(2\\)), I'm left with only the odd primes. This should give me the prime factorization of all odd divisors of \\(180\\).\n\n### **Step 3: Generating Odd Divisors Using the Remaining Prime Factors**\n\nNow, let's think about how to generate all the divisors from \\(3^2 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n- Each exponent in the prime factorization can take values from \\(0\\) up to its maximum.\n- For \\(3^2\\), the exponents are \\(0, 1, 2\\).\n- For \\(5^1\\), the exponents are \\(0, 1\\).\n  \nTo find all odd divisors, I'll calculate \\(3^a \\times 5^b\\) where:\n- \\(a\\) can be \\(0, 1, 2\\)\n- \\(b\\) can be \\(0, 1\\)\n\n**Calculation:**  \nLet's list them out:\n\n- **When \\(a = 0\\), \\(b = 0\\):**  \n  \\[\n  3^0 \\times 5^0 = 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **When \\(a = 0\\), \\(b = 1\\):**  \n  \\[\n  3^0 \\times 5^1 = 5\n  \\]\n  \n- **When \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 0\\):**  \n  \\[\n  3^1 \\times 5^0 = 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **When \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\):**  \n  \\[\n  3^1 \\times 5^1 = 15\n  \\]\n  \n- **When \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 0\\):**  \n  \\[\n  3^2 \\times 5^0 = 9\n  \\]\n  \n- **When \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 1\\):**  \n  \\[\n  3^2 \\times 5^1 = 45\n  \\]\n  \nSo, the odd divisors are:  \n\\[\n1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me quickly verify that each of these is indeed a divisor of \\(180\\) and odd.\n\n- \\(1\\): Divides \\(180\\)\n- \\(3\\): \\(180 \\div 3 = 60\\)\n- \\(5\\): \\(180 \\div 5 = 36\\)\n- \\(9\\): \\(180 \\div 9 = 20\\)\n- \\(15\\): \\(180 \\div 15 = 12\\)\n- \\(45\\): \\(180 \\div 45 = 4\\)\n\nAll these numbers divide \\(180\\) evenly, and they're all odd. Perfect!\n\n### **Step 4: Summing the Odd Divisors**\n\nNow, I'll add them up to find the sum:\n\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 15 + 45 = 78\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \nLet's break it down to make sure:\n\n- \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- \\(4 + 5 = 9\\)\n- \\(9 + 9 = 18\\)\n- \\(18 + 15 = 33\\)\n- \\(33 + 45 = 78\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIt checks out. The sum is \\(78\\).\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Result**\n\nIt's always good to double-check. Let me think:\n\n- **Alternative Method:** Could I have approached this differently? Yes, by listing all divisors and filtering out the odd ones, but that would have been more time-consuming.\n- **Quick Check:** Does \\(78\\) seem reasonable given the divisors? Yes, all odd divisors are relatively small compared to \\(180\\), and \\(78\\) fits.\n- **Cross-Verification:** I can also use the formula for the sum of divisors based on prime factors, but since I already have the odd divisors listed and summed, I think it's unnecessary.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy using prime factorization to focus on the odd components, I was able to list all odd divisors systematically and sum them up. Reflecting throughout the process helped ensure each step was correct, and quick checks confirmed the final answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe sum of all odd divisors of \\(180\\) is **78**.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we find the prime factorization of $180$ to be $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. Note that the odd divisors of 180 are precisely the integers of the form $3^a5^b$ where $0\\leq a \\leq 2$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 1$. Note also that distributing $(1+3+9)(1+5)$ yields 6 terms, with each integer of the form $3^a5^b$ appearing exactly once.  It follows that the sum of the odd divisors of 180 is $(1+3+9)(1+5)=13 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{78}$."
