    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see where it takes us. I'll walk you through my brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, checking my work, and embracing any realizations or corrections along the way\u2014just like I would if I were tackling this problem myself.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first read the question:\n\n*Javier is going to Disneyland during spring break. He plans on visiting four particular attractions all before lunch. In how many orders could he visit all four attractions once?*\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This reminds me of permutation problems I\u2019ve encountered before, where the order of visiting attractions matters.\n- I think I need to calculate the number of different sequences he can visit the four attractions.\n- But then I wonder, are there any additional constraints? Like, does he have to visit all four before lunch, or is that just a time frame?\n\n**Uncertainty:**\n- At first glance, it seems straightforward to use permutations, but I need to confirm there are no hidden conditions affecting the order.\n- Maybe considering combinations could be relevant if he needed to pick fewer attractions, but since he has to visit all four, permutations seem more fitting.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Permutations of 4 Distinct Items**\n\n*Thinking:* \n- There are four attractions Javier wants to visit. If I think of each attraction as a unique item, the question is asking for the number of ways to arrange these four items.\n\n*Formula I Recall:*\n- I remember that the formula for the number of permutations of \\( n \\) distinct items is \\( n! \\) (n factorial).\n- So, for four attractions, it would be \\( 4! \\).\n\n*But Wait...*\n- Let me double-check: does the order matter? Yes, because visiting Attraction A before B is different from visiting B before A.\n\n*Reflection:*\n- Okay, so permutations seem appropriate here. Let's proceed with that.\n\n**Strategy 2: Listing All Possible Orders**\n\n*Thinking:*\n- Another way to verify would be to list all possible sequences manually. This could help confirm the permutation calculation.\n\n*Potential Problem:*\n- But listing all permutations can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with more items.\n\n*Quick Check:*\n- Since there are only four attractions, maybe it's manageable. However, if the number were larger, this method would be impractical.\n\n*Decision:*\n- For now, I'll stick with the permutation formula to save time and check its correctness later.\n\n**Strategy 3: Factorial Breakdown**\n\n*Thinking:*\n- To ensure I\u2019m on the right track, I could break down the factorial calculation step by step.\n\n*Reflection:*\n- This might help confirm the result without listing all permutations.\n\n*Proceeding With Detail:*\n- \\( 4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\)\n\n*Checking:*\n- Let me compute that: \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\), and \\( 12 \\times 2 = 24 \\), finally \\( 24 \\times 1 = 24 \\).\n\n*Conclusion:*\n- So, \\( 4! = 24 \\). That's the number of different orders Javier can visit the attractions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation Using Permutations**\n\n1. **Identify Total Attractions:**\n   - Javier wants to visit **4** distinct attractions.\n\n2. **Apply Permutation Formula:**\n   - Number of permutations \\( = n! = 4! \\)\n\n3. **Compute Factorial:**\n   - \\( 4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24 \\)\n\n4. **Result:**\n   - There are **24** different orders Javier can visit all four attractions.\n\n---\n\n### **Natural Check and Reflection**\n\n*Quick Check:*\n- **Does 24 seem reasonable?** Yes, considering there are four attractions, the number of possible arrangements at \\( 4! \\) feels appropriate.\n\n*Deeper Reflection:*\n- **Is there any additional condition?** The problem states he wants to visit all four attractions \"before lunch.\" But since all four are to be visited and the order matters, this time constraint doesn't affect the number of permutations.\n\n- **Could there be another approach?** I briefly considered listing all possible orders, but calculating \\( 4! \\) is more efficient and confirms the result.\n\n*Final Thought:*\n- The permutation approach is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements. The answer is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Listing All Permutations**\n\n*Thinking:*\n- To further validate, let's attempt to list all possible orders manually.\n\n*List of Possible Orders:*\n1. A, B, C, D\n2. A, B, D, C\n3. A, C, B, D\n4. A, C, D, B\n5. A, D, B, C\n6. A, D, C, B\n7. B, A, C, D\n8. B, A, D, C\n9. B, C, A, D\n10. B, C, D, A\n11. B, D, A, C\n12. B, D, C, A\n13. C, A, B, D\n14. C, A, D, B\n15. C, B, A, D\n16. C, B, D, A\n17. C, D, A, B\n18. C, D, B, A\n19. D, A, B, C\n20. D, A, C, B\n21. D, B, A, C\n22. D, B, C, A\n23. D, C, A, B\n24. D, C, B, A\n\n*Verification:*\n- **Total Orders Listed:** 24\n- **Consistency:** This matches our permutation calculation, confirming its correctness.\n\n*Reflection:*\n- Listing all permutations aligns with the factorial calculation, providing a solid check on the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n*Does the approach and answer make sense?*\n- Yes, using permutations is appropriate for this problem since the order of visiting attractions matters.\n- The calculation \\( 4! = 24 \\) accurately reflects the number of possible sequences.\n- Alternative methods, like listing all permutations, confirm the result.\n\n*Are there any lingering doubts?*\n- No, the multiple strategies have converged on the same answer, and the sample check aligns with the calculation.\n\n*Final Thought:*\n- The number of orders Javier can visit all four attractions is **24**. The approach is validated through different strategies, ensuring accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy brainstorming various strategies, reflecting on each step, and cross-verifying with alternative methods, I confidently conclude that there are **24 different orders** in which Javier can visit all four attractions before lunch. This process, with its natural checks and reflections, ensures a thorough and accurate solution.",
