I\u2019ll walk through my thought process step by step\u2014brainstorming different strategies, checking if they're working, and reflecting along the way. Just like solving a problem on paper, I'll let my thinking flow naturally, including any messiness or moments of clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem:\n\n\\[\n(2008 + x)^2 = x^2\n\\]\n\nMy initial reaction is, **\"This looks like an equation involving squares. Maybe I can expand it or rearrange it somehow.\"** The presence of squares reminds me of the difference of squares formula, which is:\n\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\n\\]\n\nBut I\u2019m not sure how that directly applies here. Wait, I could also think about **expanding both sides** to see if something interesting pops out.\n\nAnother thought is to **move all terms to one side** to see if it simplifies, like setting the equation to zero. But before I dive in, let me brainstorm a bit more.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Expand both sides:** Maybe that will show me a clear path.\n- **Use the difference of squares:** If I can rearrange, maybe this applies.\n- **Set everything to one side:** Standard practice in solving equations to find x.\n\nHmm, expanding seems straightforward, but using the difference of squares might be clever if applicable. Let me start with expanding; if it gets messy, I'll reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expanding Both Sides**\n\nLet\u2019s try expanding both sides to see what we get.\n\n\\[\n(2008 + x)^2 = x^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[\n(2008 + x)(2008 + x) = 2008^2 + 2 \\times 2008 \\times x + x^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(2008^2\\):\n\n\\[\n2008 \\times 2008 = 4032064\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n4032064 + 4016x + x^2 = x^2\n\\]\n\n**Wait a minute.** I see that \\(x^2\\) appears on both sides. Let\u2019s **subtract \\(x^2\\) from both sides** to simplify:\n\n\\[\n4032064 + 4016x = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, this is looking a bit cleaner. But before I proceed, let me **reflect**: Does this make sense so far? Yes, removing \\(x^2\\) from both sides is valid since they\u2019re equal. This simplifies the equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Isolate the Variable \\(x\\)**\n\nNow, I need to **solve for \\(x\\)**. Let\u2019s isolate \\(x\\) by moving constants to the other side:\n\n\\[\n4016x = -4032064\n\\]\n\n**Wait,** let me **check if this number seems reasonable.** Negative four million is a large leap, but it might be correct. Let\u2019s assume it\u2019s right for now and continue.\n\nTo find \\(x\\), divide both sides by 4016:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-4032064}{4016}\n\\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\nx = -1004\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Is \\(x = -1004\\) reasonable? Let\u2019s substitute it back into the original equation to verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\nLet\u2019s plug \\(x = -1004\\) back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n(2008 + (-1004))^2 = (-1004)^2\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\[\n(2008 - 1004)^2 = 1004^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n1004^2 = 1008016\n\\]\n\nNow the right side:\n\n\\[\n(-1004)^2 = 1008016\n\\]\n\nSo both sides are equal:\n\n\\[\n1004^2 = 1004^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This checks out! The solution \\(x = -1004\\) satisfies the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Wait,** but the problem asked for a step-by-step approach, exploring different strategies. I only tried expanding so far. Let me **brainstorm** other methods to see if there\u2019s a different way to arrive at the same solution.\n\n1. **Difference of Squares:** Maybe I could rearrange the equation to use this formula.\n\n2. **Factoring:** Perhaps it can be factored differently to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Graphical Approach:** Although not necessary here, thinking about the graph could provide insights.\n\nLet\u2019s see if the **difference of squares** method works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Applying the Difference of Squares**\n\nRevisiting the original equation:\n\n\\[\n(2008 + x)^2 = x^2\n\\]\n\nThinking of it as:\n\n\\[\na^2 = b^2 \\quad \\text{where } a = 2008 + x \\text{ and } b = x\n\\]\n\nAccording to the difference of squares:\n\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n(2008 + x - x)(2008 + x + x) = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n2008(2008 + 2x) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Wait,** but **2008 is not zero,** so:\n\n\\[\n2008 + 2x = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n2x = -2008\n\\]\n\\[\nx = -1004\n\\]\n\n**Check:** This gives the same solution \\(x = -1004\\). Interesting! The difference of squares method also leads us to the same solution.\n\n**Reflection:** It\u2019s good to see that multiple strategies yield the same result, confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Confirming the Solution**\n\nLet\u2019s confirm once more that \\(x = -1004\\) is indeed the correct solution by substituting it back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n(2008 + (-1004))^2 = (-1004)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n1004^2 = 1008016\n\\]\n\\[\n1008016 = 1008016\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out. **Reflection:** Both methods\u2014expanding and using the difference of squares\u2014arrived at the same solution, validating its correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n**First,** I brainstormed different strategies: expanding, using the difference of squares, and considering factoring.\n\n**Initially,** I tried expanding both sides, which led to a simple linear equation. After solving it, I verified that \\(x = -1004\\) satisfied the original equation.\n\n**Then,** I explored the difference of squares method as an alternative approach, which also yielded the same solution. This cross-verification is important to ensure that the solution is correct.\n\n**Throughout the process,** I reflected and checked my work multiple times to catch any potential mistakes. Both strategies consistently led to the same result, providing confidence in the solution's validity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the equation \\((2008 + x)^2 = x^2\\) is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-1004}\n\\]",
