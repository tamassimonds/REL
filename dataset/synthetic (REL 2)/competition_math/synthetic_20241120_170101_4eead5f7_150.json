This reminds me of similar problems I've solved before.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- I remember there's a formula called the **quadratic formula** that can find the roots of such equations:  \n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n  \\]\n  \n- Another way is to **factor** the quadratic if possible. Maybe this one can be factored easily since the coefficients look small.\n\n- I could also consider using **Vieta\u2019s formulas**, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. This might be a shortcut if I can recall it correctly.\n\nHmm, let me think about which method might be the most straightforward here. Factoring seems appealing because the numbers are small, but if I get stuck, I'll switch to the quadratic formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Factor the Quadratic**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's try to factor the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\\). If I can find two numbers that multiply to the constant term (\\(c = 3\\)) and add up to the linear coefficient (\\(b = -4\\)), that would work.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Looking for two numbers that:\n  - Multiply to \\(3\\): Possible pairs are \\(1 \\times 3\\) and \\(3 \\times 1\\)\n  - Add up to \\(-4\\): So, need the pairs to sum to \\(-4\\)\n\nWait a minute, let's check those:\n\n- \\(1 + 3 = 4\\) (but we need \\(-4\\)), so perhaps using negative signs\n- Maybe \\(-1\\) and \\(-3\\) multiply to \\(3\\) and add to \\(-4\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes \\(-1\\) and \\(-3\\) work?\n\n- Multiply: \\(-1 \\times -3 = 3\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- Add: \\(-1 + (-3) = -4\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works!\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nSo, I can factor the equation as:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me quickly expand this to verify:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)(x - 3) = x^2 - 3x - x + 3 = x^2 - 4x + 3\n\\]\n\nPerfect, it matches the original equation!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Roots from the Factored Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have factored the equation, I can set each factor equal to zero to find the roots.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nx - 1 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 3 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so the roots are \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = 3\\). That makes sense.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nI need to find the **sum** of these roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Summing the Roots**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe sum of the roots is simply adding \\(1\\) and \\(3\\). But let me double-check if there's a quicker way to verify this using Vieta\u2019s formulas.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n1 + 3 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Check Using Vieta\u2019s Formulas:**\n\nVieta\u2019s formulas tell us that for a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\):\n\n- The sum of the roots \\((x_1 + x_2)\\) is \\(-\\frac{b}{a}\\)\n- The product of the roots \\((x_1 \\times x_2)\\) is \\(\\frac{c}{a}\\)\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\(a = 1\\)\n- \\(b = -4\\)\n- \\(c = 3\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of roots} = -\\frac{-4}{1} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth methods agree: factoring gives a sum of \\(4\\), and Vieta\u2019s formula also confirms it. This reassures me that the answer is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach and Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's make sure the factoring method was appropriate and that no steps were missed or incorrect.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Factoring Validity:**  \n  The factors \\((x - 1)\\) and \\((x - 3)\\) correctly multiply back to the original equation.\n\n- **Roots Correctness:**  \n  The roots \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = 3\\) satisfy the original equation:\n  \n  \\[\n  (1)^2 - 4(1) + 3 = 1 - 4 + 3 = 0\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (3)^2 - 4(3) + 3 = 9 - 12 + 3 = 0\n  \\]\n\nBoth roots satisfy the equation, so they are correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The factoring method worked well here because the quadratic was easily factorable. If the numbers were less straightforward, I might have needed to use the quadratic formula instead.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe **sum of the roots** of the equation \\(x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0\\) is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy initially attempting to factor the quadratic equation, I was able to find the roots and their sum efficiently. Checking work through both factoring and Vieta\u2019s formulas provided a double verification, ensuring the correctness of the answer. Reflecting and verifying each step helped catch any potential errors early on, leading to a confident and accurate solution.",
