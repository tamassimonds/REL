    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting as I go, and checking my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. I'll write out my thought process, including any initial confusions or realizations. Here we go!\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nWhen I first see the expression \\(2x + 3x^2 + 1 - (6 - 2x - 3x^2)\\), I notice that it involves both **addition** and **subtraction** of polynomial terms. It reminds me of simplifying expressions by combining like terms and dealing with parentheses carefully. \n\nBut wait, is there a specific order I should follow? Maybe I need to handle the parentheses first due to the subtraction sign outside. Hmm, that feels like a good starting point.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n- **Distributing the Negative Sign:** Since there's a minus sign before the parentheses, maybe distributing it will help simplify things.\n- **Combining Like Terms Before Distributing:** Alternatively, I could try combining like terms first to see if that makes distribution easier.\n- **Both Approaches Together:** Perhaps a combination of both approaches might work best.\n\n**Reflection:**\nI think starting by distributing the negative sign seems logical because it directly addresses the parentheses, which might simplify the expression right away. Let\u2019s try that.\n\n### **Step 2: Distributing the Negative Sign**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nOkay, I'll distribute the negative sign across the terms inside the parentheses. This should help me eliminate the parentheses and make the expression easier to work with.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n2x + 3x^2 + 1 - (6 - 2x - 3x^2) = 2x + 3x^2 + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x^2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nHmm, so the negative sign flips the signs of each term inside the parentheses, right? \n\n- \\(6\\) becomes \\(-6\\)\n- \\(-2x\\) becomes \\(+2x\\)\n- \\(-3x^2\\) becomes \\(+3x^2\\)\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let\u2019s move on.\n\n### **Step 3: Combining Like Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I have all the terms laid out without parentheses, I should combine like terms to simplify the expression further. \n\nBut wait, which terms are like terms? I see terms with \\(x^2\\), terms with \\(x\\), and constant terms. Let me group them accordingly.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(3x^2 + 3x^2) + (2x + 2x) + (1 - 6)\n\\]\n\n**Breaking It Down:**\n\n- **\\(x^2\\) Terms:** \\(3x^2 + 3x^2 = 6x^2\\)\n- **\\(x\\) Terms:** \\(2x + 2x = 4x\\)\n- **Constant Terms:** \\(1 - 6 = -5\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n6x^2 + 4x - 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, let me double-check my additions:\n\n- \\(3x^2 + 3x^2 = 6x^2\\) \u2014 Correct\n- \\(2x + 2x = 4x\\) \u2014 Correct\n- \\(1 - 6 = -5\\) \u2014 Correct\n\nEverything seems accurate. The simplified expression is \\(6x^2 + 4x - 5\\). But let me reflect if there's anything more I should do.\n\n### **Step 4: Checking the Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, I should ensure that the simplification makes sense and that no steps were skipped or incorrectly executed.\n\nLet\u2019s briefly go over each step:\n\n1. **Distributing the Negative Sign:** Removed parentheses correctly by flipping signs.\n2. **Combining Like Terms:** Added all corresponding coefficients accurately.\n\n**Final Check:**\nDoes the simplified expression \\(6x^2 + 4x - 5\\) match the original expression's structure but in a reduced form? \n\n- **Degree of \\(x\\):** The highest power is \\(x^2\\), which matches the original.\n- **Terms Count:** The number of terms is reduced from 7 to 3, indicating successful simplification.\n\nEverything looks good. The process seems logical, and the final expression is consistent with the original.\n\n### **Step 5: Alternative Strategy Exploration**\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, I wonder if there might be a different way to approach this problem. Initially, I thought about combining like terms first before distributing the negative sign. Let me explore that to see if it leads to the same or a different outcome.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\n1. **Combine Like Terms Within the Parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   6 - 2x - 3x^2 \n   \\]\n   \n   \u2192 No like terms to combine further.\n\n2. **Original Expression Simplified:**\n   \\[\n   2x + 3x^2 + 1 - 6 + 2x + 3x^2\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Combining Like Terms Again:**\n   \\[\n   (3x^2 + 3x^2) + (2x + 2x) + (1 - 6) = 6x^2 + 4x - 5\n   \\]\n   \n**Check:**\nWait, this seems to lead to the same simplified expression as before. It confirms that distributing the negative sign first was an effective strategy. However, starting with combining like terms within the parentheses doesn't change the outcome.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth approaches yield the same result. It\u2019s always good to check different methods to ensure accuracy, but in this case, starting with distributing the negative sign was straightforward and led directly to the simplified expression.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the calculations, the simplified expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6x^2 + 4x - 5}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nBy brainstorming various strategies and checking my work frequently, I ensured that the simplification process was correct. Initially, I started with distributing the negative sign, which effectively simplified the expression. Exploring an alternative approach confirmed the correctness of the final answer. Reflecting throughout helped catch any potential errors and strengthened the confidence in the solution. Always considering multiple strategies and verifying steps is crucial in problem-solving to arrive at the correct answer.",
