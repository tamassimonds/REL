    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, mimicking how I would naturally think through it as a human. I'll start by brainstorming various strategies, reflecting on their validity, and checking along the way to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this question, I need to **find a unit vector** that is **orthogonal** (or perpendicular) to both vectors \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n- **Unit Vector:** This means the vector has a **magnitude** of 1.\n- **Orthogonal to Both:** The vector should be **perpendicular** to both given vectors.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Cross Product:** I remember from previous problems that the **cross product** of two vectors in three-dimensional space gives a vector that is orthogonal to both. This seems like a direct approach.\n  \n- **Dot Product Check:** Another way could be to use the **dot product** to confirm orthogonality after finding a candidate vector.\n\n- **Scaling for Unit Vector:** After finding the cross product, I would need to ensure it's a unit vector by scaling it accordingly.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the cross product briefly:\n\n- I recall that the cross product involves determinants, which might get a bit messy. However, it's a tried-and-true method for finding orthogonal vectors.\n\n- Alternatively, I could explore using **linear combinations** or perhaps even geometric interpretations, but those seem less straightforward for this specific requirement.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes using the cross product make sense here? Yes, because we're specifically looking for a vector orthogonal to both, and the cross product directly provides that. Plus, ensuring it's a unit vector afterward is a manageable step.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI'll proceed with the **cross product** method and then verify if the resulting vector is a unit vector. If it doesn't work out, I'll reconsider and explore other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Cross Product**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I'm going to find the cross product of the two given vectors. The formula for the cross product \\(\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\\na_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\\\\nb_1 & b_2 & b_3\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\n- Here, \\(\\mathbf{i}, \\mathbf{j}, \\mathbf{k}\\) are the unit vectors in the x, y, and z directions, and \\(a_1, a_2, a_3\\) and \\(b_1, b_2, b_3\\) are the components of vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSet up the determinant:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 2\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculating the determinant:\n\n- **\\(\\mathbf{i}\\) Component:**\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{i} \\times \\begin{vmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{vmatrix} = \\mathbf{i} \\times (1 \\cdot 2 - 0 \\cdot 0) = 2\\mathbf{i}\n\\]\n\n- **\\(\\mathbf{j}\\) Component:**\n\n\\[\n-\\mathbf{j} \\times \\begin{vmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 2\n\\end{vmatrix} = -\\mathbf{j} \\times (1 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 0) = -2\\mathbf{j}\n\\]\n\n(Negative sign because \\(\\mathbf{j}\\) is the middle column)\n\n- **\\(\\mathbf{k}\\) Component:**\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{k} \\times \\begin{vmatrix}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0\n\\end{vmatrix} = \\mathbf{k} \\times (1 \\cdot 0 - 1 \\cdot 1) = -1\\mathbf{k}\n\\]\n\n**Resulting Vector:**\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n-2 \\\\\n-1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, so the cross product gives us the vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\). This vector should be orthogonal to both given vectors. But I need to check if it\u2019s a unit vector.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying if the Resulting Vector is a Unit Vector**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- A unit vector has a magnitude of 1. To verify this, I\u2019ll calculate the magnitude of the vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and see if it\u2019s equal to 1.\n\n- If the magnitude is not 1, I\u2019ll need to scale the vector accordingly.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nMagnitude (\\(||\\mathbf{v}||\\)) is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n||\\mathbf{v}|| = \\sqrt{(2)^2 + (-2)^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 4 + 1} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, the magnitude is 3, not 1. That means I need to scale the vector to make it a unit vector.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Scaling the Vector to Make it a Unit Vector**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To convert a vector to a unit vector, I divide each component by its magnitude.\n\n- So, I\u2019ll divide \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) by 3.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u} = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix}\n2 \\\\\n-2 \\\\\n-1\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{2}{3} \\\\\n-\\frac{2}{3} \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{3}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow, the vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{3} \\\\ -\\frac{2}{3} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{3} \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a unit vector since I've scaled it to have a magnitude of 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying Orthogonality of the Unit Vector with Given Vectors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To ensure that \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is indeed orthogonal to both \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), I\u2019ll check the dot product.\n\n- The dot product between two orthogonal vectors is zero.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Dot Product with \\(\\mathbf{a}\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{2}{3} \\\\\n-\\frac{2}{3} \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{3}\n\\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 1 + \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\times 1 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times 0 = \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{2}{3} + 0 = 0\n\\]\n\n2. **Dot Product with \\(\\mathbf{b}\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{2}{3} \\\\\n-\\frac{2}{3} \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{3}\n\\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n2\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 1 + \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\times 0 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times 2 = \\frac{2}{3} + 0 - \\frac{2}{3} = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth dot products are zero, confirming that \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is orthogonal to both \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy following the cross product method, I was able to find a vector orthogonal to both given vectors. After scaling it to ensure it's a unit vector, I verified its orthogonality through dot products, confirming the solution's correctness.\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. **Calculated the cross product** to find an orthogonal vector.\n2. **Scaled the vector** to make it a unit vector.\n3. **Verified orthogonality** with both given vectors using dot products.\n\nThis approach not only provided the correct unit vector but also ensured each step was checked for accuracy along the way.",
