I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, reflect frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's mimic a human thought process, including initial confusion, exploring various methods, checking our work, and adapting our strategy along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the expression \\(\\dfrac{\\sqrt[3]{5}}{\\sqrt[5]{5}}\\), I think about exponents and roots. It reminds me of problems dealing with simplifying expressions by using properties of exponents. I recall that dividing expressions with the same base but different exponents can be related to subtracting their exponents.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- Maybe I can use exponent rules to simplify this.\n- Alternatively, perhaps expressing both roots in terms of exponents of 5 would help.\n- I could also think about rationalizing the denominator, but that seems unnecessary here.\n- Another idea is to express the entire fraction as a single exponent of 5.\n\nI think starting with exponents makes the most sense because both the numerator and denominator involve roots that are essentially exponents.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Strategy \u2013 Expressing in Exponent Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's convert both the numerator and the denominator into exponents. This might help in simplifying the expression by applying exponent rules.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Recall that \\(\\sqrt[n]{a} = a^{1/n}\\).\n  \nSo,  \n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{5} = 5^{1/3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt[5]{5} = 5^{1/5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, so our expression becomes  \n\\[\n\\frac{5^{1/3}}{5^{1/5}}\n\\]\n\nThis looks like a good setup for applying exponent rules. According to the rules of exponents, when dividing like bases, we subtract the exponents. Let me check if that applies here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying Exponent Rule**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf \\(\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\\), then applying this here should work since both terms have the base 5.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5^{1/3}}{5^{1/5}} = 5^{1/3 - 1/5}\n\\]\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nI need to subtract the exponents \\(1/3\\) and \\(1/5\\). Let's compute that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Subtracting Exponents**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nTo subtract fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators here are 3 and 5, so the least common multiple is 15.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{15}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{3}{15}\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{15} - \\frac{3}{15} = \\frac{2}{15}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[\n5^{1/3 - 1/5} = 5^{2/15}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, so by expressing the roots as exponents and then applying the exponent rule for division, we've simplified the expression to \\(5^{2/15}\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because when dividing exponents with the same base, subtracting the exponents is the correct approach. The calculation looks correct after checking the math for subtracting fractions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIt's always good to double-check if this method is valid. Another way to verify is to think about what \\(5^{2/15}\\) represents.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nRecalling exponent properties:\n\n\\[\na^{m/n} = \\sqrt[n]{a^m}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[\n5^{2/15} = \\sqrt[15]{5^2} = \\sqrt[15]{25}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems reasonable. Taking the 15th root of 25 aligns with our original expression's structure, confirming that our simplification is correct.\n\n**Alternative Strategy Check:**\n\nCould there be another method? Perhaps rationalizing or converting everything back to roots. However, that might complicate things unnecessarily. Using exponents directly is clear and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy expressing the original expression in exponent form and applying the appropriate exponent rule, we've determined that:\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{\\sqrt[3]{5}}{\\sqrt[5]{5}} = 5^{2/15}\n\\]\n\nThis matches the solution we aimed for: identifying \\(5\\) raised to the power of \\(\\frac{2}{15}\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes \\(5^{2/15}\\) equal the original fraction? Let's briefly consider:\n\n- If \\(5^{2/15} = \\sqrt[15]{25}\\), this should hold true for the original expression.\n\nWhile this isn't a direct numerical check, understanding that our exponent manipulation accurately reflects the operations in the original expression gives confidence in the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\nBy starting with a clear understanding, exploring different strategies, applying exponent rules, and continuously checking our work, we've successfully solved the problem. This step-by-step approach, including brainstorming, reflecting, and verifying, ensures a thorough and accurate solution process\u2014mimicking a human thought process with all its natural checks and adjustments.",
