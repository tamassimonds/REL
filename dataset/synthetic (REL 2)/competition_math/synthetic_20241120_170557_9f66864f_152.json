    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's start by understanding the question thoroughly.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about two students in Ms. Smith's class, where each student averages one day absent out of thirty. We need to find the probability that one student is absent while the other is present. The final answer should be expressed as a percent rounded to the nearest tenth.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Probability Basics:** This seems like a probability question involving independent events. I remember dealing with similar problems where you calculate the chances of multiple events happening (or not happening).\n\n2. **Independent Events:** The absence of one student doesn't affect the absence of the other. So, their probabilities are independent.\n\n3. **Possible Strategies:**\n   - **Calculate Direct Probability:** Find the probability that one student is absent and the other is present.\n   - **Use Complementary Probability:** Maybe calculate the probability that both are present or both are absent and subtract from 1.\n   - **Involve Combinations:** Since we're dealing with two students, perhaps combinatorial methods could help.\n\n4. **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure which method will be the most straightforward. Let's explore these strategies and see which one makes the most sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Calculate Direct Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's try calculating the probability directly by considering both students' absence and presence scenarios.\n\n**Given:**\n- Probability a student is absent = \\( \\frac{1}{30} \\)\n- Probability a student is present = \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{29}{30} \\)\n\n**Possible Scenarios:**\n1. **First student is absent, second is present.**\n2. **First student is present, second is absent.**\n\nBoth scenarios are mutually exclusive, so we can add their probabilities.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Probability of First Scenario:**\n  - First student absent: \\( \\frac{1}{30} \\)\n  - Second student present: \\( \\frac{29}{30} \\)\n  - Combined probability: \\( \\frac{1}{30} \\times \\frac{29}{30} = \\frac{29}{900} \\)\n\n- **Probability of Second Scenario:**\n  - First student present: \\( \\frac{29}{30} \\)\n  - Second student absent: \\( \\frac{1}{30} \\)\n  - Combined probability: \\( \\frac{29}{30} \\times \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{29}{900} \\)\n\n- **Total Probability:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{29}{900} + \\frac{29}{900} = \\frac{58}{900} = \\frac{29}{450}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Hmm, that seems like a reasonable probability. But let's check if this aligns with other methods. Maybe there's a simpler way to verify this.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work:**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- The probability \\( \\frac{29}{450} \\) simplifies nicely, and it seems in line with what I expected.\n- Let me convert this to a percent to see if it looks correct.\n\n**Conversion to Percent:**\n\\[\n\\frac{29}{450} \\times 100 \\approx 6.4444\\%\n\\]\nRounded to the nearest tenth: **6.4%**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, 6.4%? That seems low for the probability of one student being absent while the other is present. Maybe I made an error in my calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Reevaluating the Approach:**\n\n**Possible Mistake:**\n- Perhaps I miscalculated the combined probabilities. Let's double-check the math.\n\n**Recalculations:**\n\n- **First Scenario:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{30} \\times \\frac{29}{30} = \\frac{29}{900}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Second Scenario:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{29}{30} \\times \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{29}{900}\n  \\]\n\n- **Total Probability:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{29}{900} + \\frac{29}{900} = \\frac{58}{900} = \\frac{29}{450}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The calculations seem correct. But maybe the low probability is due to the large sample size (30 days), making absences less likely.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Use Complementary Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's see if using complementary probability (calculating the probability of both students being present or both being absent) might simplify the problem.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Probability Both Are Present:**\n   - Each student has a \\( \\frac{29}{30} \\) chance of being present.\n   - Combined probability: \\( \\frac{29}{30} \\times \\frac{29}{30} = \\frac{841}{900} \\)\n\n2. **Probability Both Are Absent:**\n   - Each student has a \\( \\frac{1}{30} \\) chance of being absent.\n   - Combined probability: \\( \\frac{1}{30} \\times \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{1}{900} \\)\n\n3. **Probability One Is Absent and One Is Present:**\n   - Total probability = 1 - (Probability both are present + Probability both are absent)\n   \\[\n   1 - \\left(\\frac{841}{900} + \\frac{1}{900}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{842}{900} = \\frac{58}{900} = \\frac{29}{450}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This method also yields the same probability, \\( \\frac{29}{450} \\). So, both strategies align, which is a good sign.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check:**\n\n**Conversion to Percent:**\n\\[\n\\frac{29}{450} \\times 100 \\approx 6.4444\\%\n\\]\nRounded to the nearest tenth: **6.4%**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Even with both methods arriving at the same probability, the final percent seems low. But considering that each student averages one day absent out of thirty, a probability of 6.4% makes sense statistically.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The probability that out of any two students chosen at random, one will be absent while the other is present is **6.4%**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Approach Confirmation:** Both methods\u2014direct probability calculation and complementary probability\u2014yielded consistent results, affirming the correctness of the solution.\n- **Probability Check:** Given each student's absence rate, a 6.4% chance for this specific scenario aligns with expectations.\n- **Strategy Effectiveness:** Exploring different strategies helped verify the solution's accuracy, ensuring no calculation errors.\n- **Continuous Reflection:** Regularly checking the work throughout the process ensured that any potential mistakes were caught early.\n\nBy brainstorming different approaches, reflecting on each step, and thoroughly checking the work, I've arrived at a confident and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Since on each day a given student is either absent or not absent we know that the sum of the probabilities of those two events is 1, which means that the probability of a given student being present on a particular day is $1-\\frac{1}{30}=\\frac{29}{30}$. There are two ways in which we can have one student there and the other one not there: either the first one is there and the second one isn't which will occur with probability $\\frac{29}{30}\\cdot\\frac{1}{30}=\\frac{29}{900}$ or the first one will be absent and the second one will be present which occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{30}\\cdot\\frac{29}{30}=\\frac{29}{900}$. The sum of these gives us the desired probability: $\\frac{29}{900}+\\frac{29}{900}=\\frac{58}{900}=.06444...$, which, as a percent rounded to the nearest tenth, gives us our answer of $\\boxed{6.4}$."
