    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a human thought process with brainstorming, reflection, and checks along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I see the question \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4} \\), my initial reaction is to recognize it as an exponentiation problem involving a fraction. Exponentiation means multiplying the base by itself a certain number of times\u2014in this case, four times.\n\n- **What does this represent?** I remember that raising a fraction to an exponent means multiplying the fraction by itself repeatedly. So, \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4} \\) would be \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n- **Does this remind me of anything?** It feels similar to problems I've solved before with whole numbers, but with fractions, I need to be careful about multiplying the numerators and denominators correctly.\n\n- **Am I on the right track?** Yeah, multiplying the fraction by itself multiple times seems correct, but I should ensure that I handle the exponents properly.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Multiplication:** Multiply \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) by itself four times.\n2. **Break it Down into Smaller Steps:** Calculate \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} \\) first, then square that result.\n3. **Using Properties of Exponents:** Recall that \\( (a^{b})^{c} = a^{b \\times c} \\) and see if it applies here.\n\n**Explploring the First Strategy: Direct Multiplication**\n\n- **Attempt:** Multiply \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n  \n- **Thoughts:** This seems straightforward, but it requires multiple steps. Maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\n- **Reflection:** It looks like I might make mistakes if I don't keep track of the numerators and denominators properly.\n\n**Deciding on a Different Approach: Using Exponent Properties**\n\nGiven the potential for error in direct multiplication, I think using properties of exponents might simplify the process.\n\n- **Strategy:** Rewriting the expression using exponent rules: \\( \\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^{n} = \\frac{a^{n}}{b^{n}} \\).\n\n- **Application:** So, \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4} = \\frac{1^{4}}{2^{4}} \\).\n\n**Checking if This Approach Makes Sense**\n\n- **Does it simplify the process?** Yes, calculating \\( 1^{4} \\) and \\( 2^{4} \\) separately is straightforward.\n  \n- **Is it correct?** It seems logical because each part of the fraction is raised to the exponent independently.\n\n**Proceeding with the Revised Strategy**\n\nNow, let's execute this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Exponent Properties**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4} = \\frac{1^{4}}{2^{4}}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- \\( 1^{4} = 1 \\) because any number raised to any power remains 1.\n  \n- **Quick Check:** Does raising 1 to any power change its value? No, so this part is correct.\n\n- \\( 2^{4} = 16 \\) because \\( 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16 \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** Calculating \\( 2^{4} \\) directly is simple and reduces the risk of error compared to multiplying \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) multiple times.\n\n### **Step 2: Writing the Result as a Fraction**\n\n**Result So Far:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1^{4}}{2^{4}} = \\frac{1}{16}\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Thoughts:** So, \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4} = \\frac{1}{16} \\). This makes sense because each multiplication by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) halves the previous result.\n\n- **Check:** Is \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\) consistent with what I expect? Yes, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) multiplied by itself four times should yield a smaller fraction, and \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\) is indeed smaller than \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Confirming the Final Answer**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4} = \\frac{1}{16}\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Does the answer align with exponent rules?** Yes, raising a fraction to an exponent should divide the numerator by the denominator raised to that power.\n\n- **Is there a logical consistency?** Absolutely. Each step follows from the previous one, ensuring no mistakes in the calculations.\n\n- **Reflecting Back:** Initially, I considered direct multiplication, which would have worked but was prone to errors. Switching to exponent properties simplified the problem and reduced the chances of making a mistake.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies and reflecting on each step, I determined that \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{4} = \\frac{1}{16} \\). Using exponent properties was the most efficient method, ensuring accuracy and clarity in the solution. Always checking and confirming each part of the process helped to avoid potential errors and validate the final answer.",
