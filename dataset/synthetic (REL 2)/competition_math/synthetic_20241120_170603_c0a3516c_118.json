    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming how to tackle it, exploring different strategies, and reflecting on whether each approach makes sense. If something doesn't work, I'll adjust my method accordingly. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 3x + \\frac{3}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^2} = 26 \\]\n\nI think, \"Hmm, this looks like it involves both \\(x\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\). Maybe I can simplify it by combining these terms somehow?\"\n\n*Another thought*: \"Wait, there's a quadratic term and inverse terms. Possibly combining like terms or maybe even completing the square could help. Or perhaps manipulating the equation to get rid of the fractions?\"\n\n*Idea*: Let\u2019s see if we can express everything in terms of \\(x + \\frac{1}{x}\\), since that might simplify things. But then again, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019ll lead me directly to \\(x\\) in the form \\(a + \\sqrt{b}\\) as required.\n\n*Reflection*: \"Okay, so eliminating fractions might be a good start. After that, maybe considering substitutions or looking for patterns would help.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Eliminate Fractions**\n\n*Thought Process*: To get rid of the fractions, I notice two terms involve \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\). Maybe multiplying through by \\(x^2\\) could simplify the equation.\n\n*Calculation*:\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(x^2\\):\n\n\\[ x^2 \\cdot (x^2 + 3x + \\frac{3}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^2}) = 26 \\cdot x^2 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ x^4 + 3x^3 + 3x + 1 = 26x^2 \\]\n\n*Reflection*: \"Okay, now the equation is cleaner without fractions. But now we have all terms on one side; let's set it to zero.\"\n\n*Next Step*: Bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[ x^4 + 3x^3 - 26x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Factoring or Quadratic Formula**\n\n*Thought Process*: This looks like a quartic (fourth-degree) polynomial. Factoring quartics directly can be tricky. Maybe I can use substitution to reduce its degree. Alternatively, the Quadratic Formula might work if I can express it in a quadratic form.\n\n*Idea*: \"Let's see if substituting \\(y = x + \\frac{1}{x}\\) can help. However, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019ll directly lead to a quadratic in \\(x\\). Maybe I need to explore other substitutions first.\"\n\n*Reflection*: \"Wait, substituting might complicate things. Let\u2019s try another approach before going down that path.\"\n\n*Next Approach*: Maybe attempting to factor by grouping or looking for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem.\n\n*Calculation*: \n\nLet\u2019s look for possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots could be factors of the constant term \\(1\\) divided by factors of the leading coefficient \\(1\\):\n\nPossible roots: \\(\\pm 1\\)\n\n*Check \\(x = 1\\)*:\n\n\\[ 1^4 + 3(1)^3 - 26(1)^2 + 3(1) + 1 = 1 + 3 - 26 + 3 + 1 = -18 \\neq 0 \\]\n\n*Check \\(x = -1\\)*:\n\n\\[ (-1)^4 + 3(-1)^3 - 26(-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 1 = 1 - 3 - 26 - 3 + 1 = -30 \\neq 0 \\]\n\n*Reflection*: \"Neither \\(x = 1\\) nor \\(x = -1\\) are roots. Maybe factoring isn\u2019t the right path here.\"\n\n*Next Step*: Since factoring seems unproductive, perhaps a substitution involving \\(y = x + \\frac{1}{x}\\) will help, but let\u2019s see if that simplifies the quartic effectively.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Attempting Substitution \\(y = x + \\frac{1}{x}\\)**\n\n*Thought Process*: By letting \\(y = x + \\frac{1}{x}\\), I recall that squaring this would involve \\(x^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}\\). This might help relate \\(x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}\\) back to \\(y\\).\n\n*Calculation*:\n\nFirst, express \\(x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}\\) in terms of \\(y\\):\n\n\\[ y = x + \\frac{1}{x} \\]\n\n\\[ y^2 = \\left(x + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2 = x^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} = y^2 - 2 \\]\n\n*Reflection*: \"That\u2019s useful! Now, looking back at the original equation, maybe substituting this would simplify it.\"\n\n*Next Step*: Substitute \\(x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} = y^2 - 2\\) into the original equation.\n\n*Calculation*:\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 3x + \\frac{3}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^2} = 26 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\(x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} = y^2 - 2\\):\n\n\\[ y^2 - 2 + 3x + \\frac{3}{x} = 26 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ y^2 - 2 + 3x + \\frac{3}{x} = 26 \\]\n\n\\[ y^2 + 3x + \\frac{3}{x} = 28 \\]\n\n*Problem*: \"Wait, we still have \\(3x + \\frac{3}{x}\\) in there. How does this connect to \\(y\\)?\"\n\n*Realization*: \"I need to express \\(3x + \\frac{3}{x}\\) in terms of \\(y\\). Maybe multiplying \\(y\\) by 3 could help since \\(y = x + \\frac{1}{x}\\).\"\n\n*Next Idea*: \"Let\u2019s see if multiplying \\(y\\) by 3 gives the terms we have.\"\n\n*Calculation*:\n\nMultiply \\(y\\) by 3:\n\n\\[ 3y = 3\\left(x + \\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 3x + 3\\frac{1}{x} \\]\n\n*Reflection*: \"Oh, that\u2019s exactly the \\(3x + \\frac{3}{x}\\) term we have. Perfect!\"\n\n*Next Step*: Substitute \\(3y\\) into the equation.\n\n*Calculation*:\n\n\\[ y^2 + 3x + \\frac{3}{x} = 28 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\(3y\\) for \\(3x + \\frac{3}{x}\\):\n\n\\[ y^2 + 3y = 28 \\]\n\n*Reflection*: \"Now the equation is quadratic in terms of \\(y\\). This is starting to look promising.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the Quadratic Equation for \\(y\\)**\n\n*Thought Process*: Now that we have a quadratic equation in \\(y\\), it\u2019s straightforward to solve for \\(y\\) using the quadratic formula.\n\n*Calculation*:\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ y^2 + 3y - 28 = 0 \\]\n\nBut before applying the quadratic formula, let's check if it\u2019s factorable.\n\nPossible pairs of factors of \\(-28\\) that add up to \\(3\\): \n\n1. \\(4 \\times -7 = -28\\) and \\(4 + (-7) = -3\\) (Doesn\u2019t match)\n2. \\(-4 \\times 7 = -28\\) and \\(-4 + 7 = 3\\) (Matches!)\n\n*Reflection*: \"Great! It\u2019s factorable. Let\u2019s factor the quadratic equation.\"\n\n*Calculation*:\n\n\\[ y^2 + 3y - 28 = (y - 4)(y + 7) = 0 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ y - 4 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y + 7 = 0 \\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ y = 4 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y = -7 \\]\n\n*Reflection*: \"Okay, we have two possible values for \\(y\\). Let\u2019s see which one makes sense in the context of the original equation.\"\n\n*Next Step*: Recall that \\(y = x + \\frac{1}{x}\\). We need to find \\(x\\) from these \\(y\\) values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving for \\(x\\) from \\(y = 4\\) and \\(y = -7\\)**\n\n*Thought Process*: Since \\(x\\) must be a positive integer (as stated in the problem), we\u2019ll only consider positive solutions for \\(x\\). Therefore, \\(y = -7\\) doesn't make sense because it would lead to negative or undefined \\(x\\).\n\n*Calculation*:\n\nLet\u2019s solve \\(y = 4\\):\n\n\\[ y = x + \\frac{1}{x} = 4 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(x\\) to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 1 = 4x \\]\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 \\]\n\n*Reflection*: \"This is a quadratic equation. Let's solve it using the quadratic formula.\"\n\n*Calculation*:\n\nQuadratic formula:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nFor our equation:\n\n\\[ a = 1, \\quad b = -4, \\quad c = 1 \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 1}}{2 \\times 1} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\n*Reflection*: \"We have two possible solutions for \\(x\\): \\(2 + \\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\). But since \\(x\\) must be a positive integer, only \\(2 + \\sqrt{3}\\) fits this requirement. However, \\(2 + \\sqrt{3}\\) isn\u2019t exactly an integer. This suggests that the problem might be looking for \\(x\\) in the form \\(a + \\sqrt{b}\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers, so maybe it\u2019s already in that form.\"\n\n*Next Step*: Identify \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from \\(x = 2 + \\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Identifying \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**\n\n*Thought Process*: Given the solution \\(x = 2 + \\sqrt{3}\\), we can directly match it to the form \\(a + \\sqrt{b}\\). Here, \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 3\\).\n\n*Calculation*:\n\n\\[ x = a + \\sqrt{b} = 2 + \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ a = 2, \\quad b = 3 \\]\n\n*Reflection*: \"This seems straightforward. Now, to find \\(a + b\\), we simply add these values.\"\n\n*Calculation*:\n\n\\[ a + b = 2 + 3 = 5 \\]\n\n*Reflection*: \"Double-checking, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are indeed positive integers, and the equation \\(x = 2 + \\sqrt{3}\\) satisfies the original condition. So, everything aligns.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n*Thought Process*: Before finalizing, let's ensure that the solution \\(x = 2 + \\sqrt{3}\\) satisfies the original equation.\n\n*Calculation*:\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 3x + \\frac{3}{x} + \\frac{1}{x^2} = 26 \\]\n\nPlugging in \\(x = 2 + \\sqrt{3}\\):\n\n1. Calculate \\(x^2\\):\n\n   \\[\n   x^2 = (2 + \\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 + 4\\sqrt{3} + 3 = 7 + 4\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{x^2} = \\frac{1}{7 + 4\\sqrt{3}}\n   \\]\n\n   To rationalize the denominator:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{7 + 4\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{7 - 4\\sqrt{3}}{7 - 4\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{7 - 4\\sqrt{3}}{49 - 48} = 7 - 4\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate \\(3x\\):\n\n   \\[\n   3x = 3(2 + \\sqrt{3}) = 6 + 3\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate \\(\\frac{3}{x}\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{x} = \\frac{3}{2 + \\sqrt{3}}\n   \\]\n\n   Rationalizing the denominator:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{2 + \\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2 - \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{6 - 3\\sqrt{3}}{4 - 3} = 6 - 3\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n5. Substitute back into the original equation:\n\n   \\[\n   (7 + 4\\sqrt{3}) + (6 + 3\\sqrt{3}) + (6 - 3\\sqrt{3}) + (7 - 4\\sqrt{3}) = 26\n   \\]\n\n   Combine like terms:\n\n   \\[\n   (7 + 6 + 6 + 7) + (4\\sqrt{3} + 3\\sqrt{3} - 3\\sqrt{3} - 4\\sqrt{3}) = 26\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   26 + 0\\sqrt{3} = 26\n   \\]\n\n*Reflection*: \"Everything checks out. The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\(x = 2 + \\sqrt{3}\\) is indeed a solution.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the solution, we've determined that:\n\n\\[ x = 2 + \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ a = 2, \\quad b = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ a + b = 2 + 3 = \\boxed{5} \\]\n\n*Final Reflection*: \"By brainstorming initial thoughts, attempting to eliminate fractions, and subsequently using substitution to simplify the equation, we arrived at the correct solution. Checking each step ensured that the final answer is accurate.\"",
