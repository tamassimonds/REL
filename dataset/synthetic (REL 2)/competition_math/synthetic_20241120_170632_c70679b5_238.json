Compute each multiplication first, then add them up and take the modulo.\n2. **Simplify Expressions Before Multiplying:** Perhaps reduce numbers modulo \\(13\\) before doing multiplications to make calculations easier.\n3. **Group Terms to Simplify:** Maybe group terms to see if patterns or properties of modulo can simplify the problem.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAt first glance, the **first strategy** seems the most direct: compute each term individually with modulo \\(13\\). But the **second strategy** could save time by reducing large numbers right away. Let\u2019s try the second strategy and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Reducing Terms Modulo \\(13\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore jumping into multiplications, let's **reduce each term modulo \\(13\\)**. This should make the calculations more manageable.\n\n**Breaking It Down:**\n\n1. **Reduce \\(247\\) modulo \\(13\\):**\n   - \\(247 \\div 13 = 19\\) with a remainder of \\(0\\).\n   - So, \\(247 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13\\).\n\n2. **Reduce \\(39\\) modulo \\(13\\):**\n   - \\(39 \\div 13 = 3\\) with a remainder of \\(0\\).\n   - Thus, \\(39 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13\\).\n\n3. **Reduce \\(143\\) modulo \\(13\\):**\n   - \\(143 \\div 13 = 11\\) with a remainder of \\(0\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(143 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13\\).\n\n4. **Reduce \\(15\\) modulo \\(13\\):**\n   - \\(15 \\div 13 = 1\\) with a remainder of \\(2\\).\n   - So, \\(15 \\equiv 2 \\mod 13\\).\n\n**Check:**  \nWait a minute... all those numbers except \\(15\\) reduce to \\(0\\) modulo \\(13\\). That seems **too neat**, but let's roll with it for now.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIf all multiplications involving \\(0\\) modulo \\(13\\) yield \\(0\\), then only the term involving \\(15\\) might contribute to the final sum. This simplifies things significantly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Applying the Reductions to the Original Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, let's **substitute these reductions back into the original expression** to see what we're left with.\n\n**Original Expression:**  \n\\[247 + 5 \\cdot 39 + 7 \\cdot 143 + 4 \\cdot 15\\]\n\n**Substituting Reductions:**\n- \\(247 \\equiv 0\\)\n- \\(5 \\cdot 39 \\equiv 5 \\cdot 0 = 0\\)\n- \\(7 \\cdot 143 \\equiv 7 \\cdot 0 = 0\\)\n- \\(4 \\cdot 15 \\equiv 4 \\cdot 2 = 8\\)\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[0 + 0 + 0 + 8 = 8\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, does this make sense? All terms except \\(4 \\cdot 15\\) became \\(0\\). Given that, the final result being \\(8\\) seems **reasonable**.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSince the only non-zero term is \\(4 \\cdot 15\\) reduced to \\(8\\) modulo \\(13\\), the final answer should indeed be \\(8\\). The other terms cancelling out simplifies the problem a lot.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet me **double-check** each step to ensure everything aligns. Did reducing numbers before calculations help? Let's see if this approach consistently leads to the correct answer.\n\n**Verifying Each Reduction:**\n- **\\(247 \\mod 13\\):** Correctly reduced to \\(0\\).\n- **\\(39 \\mod 13\\):** Correctly reduced to \\(0\\).\n- **\\(143 \\mod 13\\):** Correctly reduced to \\(0\\).\n- **\\(15 \\mod 13\\):** Correctly reduced to \\(2\\), and multiplying by \\(4\\) gives \\(8\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll reductions seem accurate. By reducing before multiplying, we avoided dealing with larger numbers, making the calculation straightforward. This approach appears **efficient and correct**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: **Exploring an Alternative Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEven though the first strategy worked well, let's **consider another method** to ensure its robustness. Maybe there's a pattern or property of modulo arithmetic that could simplify things further.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Modulo Distributive Property**\n- **Distributive Property of Modulo:**\n  \\[(a + b) \\mod m = [(a \\mod m) + (b \\mod m)] \\mod m\\]\n  \n- **Applying to the Expression:**\n  Let's see if applying this property helps in verifying our result.\n\n**Breaking It Down:**\n1. **Modulo \\(13\\) of Each Term:**\n   - \\(247 \\mod 13 = 0\\)\n   - \\(5 \\cdot 39 \\mod 13 = 0\\)\n   - \\(7 \\cdot 143 \\mod 13 = 0\\)\n   - \\(4 \\cdot 15 \\mod 13 = 8\\)\n\n2. **Adding Reduced Terms:**\n   \\[0 + 0 + 0 + 8 = 8\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThis alternative approach leads to the same result, \\(8\\), confirming the correctness of the initial method.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nUsing the distributive property reinforced that reducing each term individually was effective. Both strategies align, validating the solution.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n**Summing Up:**  \nBy **reducing each term modulo \\(13\\)** before performing multiplications, we simplified the problem significantly. This method ensured that only the non-zero contributing term affected the final result, leading us directly to the answer.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- **Reducing Early:** Simplifying terms before computations can prevent dealing with large numbers and streamline the process.\n- **Verifying Steps:** Regularly checking each step ensures accuracy and builds confidence in the final answer.\n- **Alternative Approaches:** Considering multiple strategies can confirm correctness and provide deeper understanding.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe modulo \\(13\\) residue of \\(247 + 5 \\cdot 39 + 7 \\cdot 143 + 4 \\cdot 15\\) is **\\(8\\)**.",
