    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll share my initial thoughts, brainstorm different strategies, and reflect frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. If something doesn't seem right, I'll pivot and try another approach. It's important to think aloud, make mistakes, and have those \"aha\" moments along the way. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem asks for \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) divided by 3. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a fraction divided by a whole number. I remember something from math class about dividing fractions, but I'm not entirely sure how to apply it here.\n  \n- **Brainstorming:** Maybe I should convert the whole number into a fraction first? That seems like a common strategy. Or perhaps there's another method that deals directly with dividing by a whole number.\n\n**Reflection:** Converting 3 into a fraction makes sense because it aligns the formats. Let's try that approach to see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Converting the Whole Number to a Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf I want to divide a fraction by a whole number, it might help to express the whole number as a fraction. \n\n- **Action:** Convert 3 into a fraction:  \n  \\[\n  3 = \\frac{3}{1}\n  \\]\n\n**Checking:** Does this make sense? Yes, converting to a fraction keeps the operation consistent. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up the Division of Fractions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that both numbers are fractions, I can apply the rule for dividing fractions. I vaguely remember that dividing by a fraction involves multiplying by its reciprocal.\n\n- **Strategy:**  \n  When dividing \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) by \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\), it\u2019s the same as multiplying \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) by \\(\\frac{d}{c}\\).\n\n- **Applying to Our Problem:**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{2}{5} \\div \\frac{3}{1} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, this seems familiar. Multiplying by the reciprocal should work here. Let's proceed and see if the numbers make sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Multiplying the Fractions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTime to multiply \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). I remember that to multiply fractions, you multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{2 \\times 1}{5 \\times 3} = \\frac{2}{15}\n  \\]\n\n**Checking:**  \n- **Numerator:** \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\)  \n- **Denominator:** \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\)  \n- **Result:** \\(\\frac{2}{15}\\)\n\nThis looks correct. The fraction is simplified, and I don't see any mistakes here.\n\n**Reflection:** Multiplying by the reciprocal worked as expected. The answer seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Result Using an Alternative Method**\n\n**Thinking:**  \nTo ensure the accuracy of our solution, let's try another approach. Maybe there's a way to visualize or conceptualize dividing a fraction by a whole number that validates our previous method.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy:**  \n  Dividing \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) by 3 means finding out how much \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) is spread over 3 equal parts.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  Split \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) into 3 equal parts:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2}{5} \\div 3 = \\frac{2 \\div 3}{5} = \\frac{2}{15}\n  \\]\n\n**Checking:**  \n- **Numerator Division:** \\(2 \\div 3\\) doesn't go evenly, so we keep it as \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).  \n- **Denominator remains the same:** \\(5\\)  \n- **Result:** \\(\\frac{2}{15}\\)\n\n**Reflection:** Both methods yield the same result\u2014\\(\\frac{2}{15}\\)\u2014which reinforces the correctness of our solution. It's always good to cross-verify using different strategies to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n\n**Thinking:**  \nNow, let's briefly assess whether \\(\\frac{2}{15}\\) feels right in the context of the problem.\n\n- **Interpretation:** Dividing \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) by 3 means distributing \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) over 3 parts. Each part would logically be less than \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\), and \\(\\frac{2}{15}\\) is indeed smaller than \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\).\n\n- **Again:** \\(\\frac{2}{15}\\) is a reduced fraction, and the operation aligns with the rules of dividing fractions.\n\n**Conclusion:** Everything checks out\u2014our answer is consistent across different methods, and it makes sense within the problem's context.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies and methodically applying the rule for dividing fractions, we arrived at the solution:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\div 3 = \\frac{2}{15}\n\\]\n\nWe verified the result using an alternative approach, ensuring the answer's correctness. Throughout the process, reflecting and checking each step helped confirm that our strategy was effective and accurate.\n\nBy thinking aloud and exploring various methods, we not only solved the problem but also reinforced our understanding of dividing fractions by whole numbers.\n\n---\n\n**Final Check:**  \n- **Does the answer seem correct?** Yes, \\(\\frac{2}{15}\\) fits logically and mathematically.  \n- **Is there any aspect that feels off?** No, all checks align with the expected outcomes.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with continuous reflection and validation, ensured a thorough and accurate solution to the problem.",
