    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process, brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work as I go\u2014just like how you naturally would when solving a problem manually.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:  \n\\[\n\\frac{5x}{x+3} - \\frac{3}{x+3} = \\frac{1}{x+3}\n\\]\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**  \n- **Similar to Simplifying Fractions:** This reminds me of simplifying fractions with a common denominator. Maybe I could combine the fractions on the left side.\n- **Isolate \\(x\\):** Alternatively, I could try to get all terms involving \\(x\\) on one side to see if that helps.\n- **Cross-Multiplication:** Maybe multiplying both sides by the denominator to eliminate it would work, but that might complicate things.\n- **Factorization:** Perhaps factoring out common terms could simplify it.\n\n**Feeling:**  \nI\u2019m leaning towards combining the fractions on the left since they share a common denominator. That seems like a straightforward starting point.\n\n### **Step 1: Combine Like Terms on the Left Side**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf both fractions on the left have the same denominator \\((x + 3)\\), I should be able to combine the numerators.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{5x - 3}{x + 3} = \\frac{1}{x + 3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense?  \n- Both fractions now have the same denominator, so combining numerators is valid.\n- The equation looks cleaner now.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis feels like a good simplification. Let\u2019s move on to the next step.\n\n### **Step 2: Set Numerators Equal to Each Other**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince the denominators are the same and fractions are equal, their numerators must also be equal.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n5x - 3 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nIs this logical?  \n- Yes, if \\(\\frac{A}{B} = \\frac{C}{B}\\), then \\(A = C\\) is a valid conclusion.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems correct. Now, let\u2019s solve for \\(x\\).\n\n### **Step 3: Solve for \\(x\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI need to isolate \\(x\\). This looks like a simple linear equation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n5x - 3 = 1 \\\\\n5x = 1 + 3 \\\\\n5x = 4 \\\\\nx = \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes \\(x = \\frac{4}{5}\\) make sense in the original equation?  \n- Let\u2019s plug it back in.\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Solution by Substituting Back**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAlways a good idea to check if the solution satisfies the original equation to ensure no mistakes were made along the way.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{5(\\frac{4}{5})}{(\\frac{4}{5} + 3)} - \\frac{3}{(\\frac{4}{5} + 3)} = \\frac{1}{(\\frac{4}{5} + 3)} \\\\\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Denominator:**\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5} + 3 = \\frac{4}{5} + \\frac{15}{5} = \\frac{19}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Plugging Back:**\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{\\frac{19}{5}} - \\frac{3}{\\frac{19}{5}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{19}{5}} \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{4 \\times 5}{19} - \\frac{3 \\times 5}{19} = \\frac{5}{19} \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{19} - \\frac{15}{19} = \\frac{5}{19}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{19} = \\frac{5}{19}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nBoth sides are equal, so the solution \\(x = \\frac{4}{5}\\) is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis confirms that our step-by-step approach was right. Each stage logically led to the next, and verifying the solution ensured accuracy.\n\n### **Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Alternative Idea:**  \nMaybe after combining the fractions, I could have multiplied both sides by \\(x + 3\\) to eliminate the denominator right away. Let\u2019s see how that would work.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{5x - 3}{x + 3}\\right) \\times (x + 3) = \\left(\\frac{1}{x + 3}\\right) \\times (x + 3) \\\\\n5x - 3 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Solving:**  \n\\[\n5x = 4 \\\\\nx = \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThis method also leads to the same solution. However, it skips the step of combining like terms, which might be less intuitive for some.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth strategies arrived at the same solution. Starting by combining fractions seemed more straightforward for this problem.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Approach Worked:** Combining fractions on the left was an effective starting point.\n- **Verification is Key:** Always check the solution by plugging it back into the original equation to catch any potential mistakes.\n- **Multiple Strategies are Valid:** Depending on the problem, there might be several valid approaches. It\u2019s beneficial to brainstorm and choose the one that feels most intuitive.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBy carefully considering different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the solution, we confidently arrived at \\(x = \\frac{4}{5}\\) as the correct answer.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we combine the fraction on the left to give $\\frac{5x-3}{x+3} = \\frac{1}{x+3}$.  Then, multiplying both sides by $x+3$ gets rid of the denominators and leaves $5x-3 = 1$.  Adding 3 to both sides gives $5x=4$, so $x = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$."
