    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem just like how I would tackle it in real life. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check if I'm on the right path, and adjust my approach if needed. Let's make it as human-like as possible, with all the messy thinking and spontaneous insights that come along.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem is to **express** \\(\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x\\ as a product of trigonometric functions.**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This seems familiar. I remember there are trigonometric identities that deal with the sum of sine functions. Maybe I can use the sine addition or angle difference identities.\n\n- **Another Idea:** Or perhaps there's a way to convert this into a product using the sum-to-product identities. That might be what they're looking for.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure if both methods will lead to the same result, or if one is more straightforward than the other.\n\n- **Exploring:** Let's start by recalling the sum-to-product identities since that seems like a direct approach for expressing a sum as a product.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Sum-to-Product Identities**\n\n- **Thought Process:** I remember that the sum of two sine functions can be expressed as a product involving cosine and sine. This seems like a direct way to tackle the problem.\n\n- **Formula Recall:** The sum-to-product identity I'm thinking of is:\n  \\[\n  \\sin A + \\sin B = 2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{A + B}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{A - B}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n  Where in our case, \\(A = 4x\\) and \\(B = 6x\\).\n\n- **Next Step:** Apply this identity to \\(\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Strategy 1**\n\n#### **Applying Sum-to-Product Identity**\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  A = 4x, \\quad B = 6x\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\sin 4x + \\sin 6x = 2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{4x + 6x}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{6x - 4x}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{10x}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{2x}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 2 \\sin 5x \\cos x\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** That seems straightforward. By applying the sum-to-product identity, I transformed the sum into a product involving \\(\\sin 5x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\). This looks correct based on the identity.\n\n- **Quick Check:** \n  - **Is this what the question asked?** Yes, the question asked to express \\(\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x\\ as a product, and that's exactly what I've done.\n  - **Does it match any known identity?** Yes, it aligns with the sum-to-product identities I've recalled.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n- **Checking Validity:** \n  - **Formula Correctness:** The sum-to-product identity is a well-established trigonometric identity. Applying it here seems appropriate.\n  - **Substitutions:** The substitutions \\(A = 4x\\) and \\(B = 6x\\) are straightforward and align with the formula.\n\n- **Potential Mistakes:**\n  - **Risk of Error:** Maybe I misapplied the identity if the final answer doesn't make sense. But, given that I followed the identity correctly, this seems unlikely.\n\n- **Thought:** Wait, let me double-check the steps to make sure everything aligns.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Alternative Strategy**\n\n#### **Alternative Strategy: Angle Difference Identity**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Another approach could be using the sine addition formula, but since I initially thought of the sum-to-product identity, I'll stick with that for now. If this doesn't seem right, I'll explore other identities.\n\n- **Exploration:** Perhaps attempting the sine addition formula:\n  \\[\n  \\sin(A + B) = \\sin A \\cos B + \\cos A \\sin B\n  \\]\n  But that would lead to a sum, not a product, which isn't what we need.\n\n- **Reflection:** This doesn't directly help in converting a sum into a product, so it's less relevant here.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The sum-to-product identity is the most direct and applicable method I have.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Reflection**\n\n- **Final Check:** \n  - **Consistency with Identities:** The result \\(2 \\sin 5x \\cos x\\) is consistent with the sum-to-product identity.\n  - **Does it satisfy the question?** Yes, the sum \\(\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x\\) is expressed as a product of trigonometric functions.\n\n- **Thoughts:** Initially, I considered using different strategies, but the sum-to-product identity provided a clear and straightforward solution. Alternative methods like the sine addition formula didn't directly apply, which reaffirmed that the sum-to-product identity was the right choice.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy applying the **sum-to-product identity**, I transformed \\(\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x\\) into:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2 \\sin 5x \\cos x}\n\\]\n\nThrough brainstorming and exploring different strategies, I verified that the sum-to-product identity was the most effective approach. Reflecting throughout ensured the solution was correct and aligned with trigonometric principles.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step walkthrough, complete with brainstorming, reflections, and checks, captures the human-like thought process in solving trigonometric problems.
