I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they work, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's start by **really understanding** the question.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nThe question states that:\n\n- The **product** of two positive integers is **18**.\n- The **positive difference** between these integers is **3**.\n- I need to find the **sum** of these two integers.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Products and Factors:** When I see a product, I think about the factors of that number. How can I break down 18 into its factor pairs?\n- **Difference Given:** The positive difference being 3 suggests that the two integers are relatively close to each other in value.\n- **Sum Calculation:** Once I find the integers, adding them up should be straightforward.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this align with what I know? Yes, I remember that for any two numbers, if I know their product and difference, I can set up equations to solve for them.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Factor Pairs of 18:** List all pairs of integers that multiply to 18 and check their differences.\n2. **Algebraic Equations:** Let\u2019s set up equations based on the product and difference.\n3. **Quadratic Equation:** Since we have two variables, maybe a quadratic equation could help.\n\n**Check Before Proceeding:**\n- Factor pairs might be quicker.\n- If that doesn't work, I'll try algebraic equations.\n\n---\n  \n### **Step 2: Exploring the Factor Pair Strategy**\n\n**Thinking:**\n\nLet\u2019s start with **listing the factor pairs** of 18:\n\n- \\(1 \\times 18 = 18\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\)\n\n**Checking Differences:**\n\n- **(1, 18):** Difference = \\(18 - 1 = 17\\) \n  - **Doesn\u2019t match** the given difference of 3.\n\n- **(2, 9):** Difference = \\(9 - 2 = 7\\) \n  - **Still doesn\u2019t match**.\n\n- **(3, 6):** Difference = \\(6 - 3 = 3\\) \n  - **Matches** the given difference!\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, (3, 6) works! The difference is indeed 3. But let\u2019s **double-check** to ensure there are no other pairs.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- All factors of 18 have been checked.\n- Only **(3, 6)** satisfies both conditions.\n\n**Sum Calculation:**\n\n- \\(3 + 6 = 9\\)\n\n**Checking if This Makes Sense:**\n\n- **Product:** \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\) \u2705\n- **Difference:** \\(6 - 3 = 3\\) \u2705\n- **Sum:** \\(3 + 6 = 9\\) \u2705\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt seems like we\u2019ve found the correct pair.

Let\u2019s try factoring first since the numbers are relatively small.*\n\n- Looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-18\\) and add up to \\(3\\).\n- The numbers are \\(6\\) and \\(-3\\).\n\n**Factoring the Equation:**\n\n- \\( (y + 6)(y - 3) = 0 \\)\n\n**Solving for \\(y\\):**\n\n- \\(y + 6 = 0 \\rightarrow y = -6\\)\n- \\(y - 3 = 0 \\rightarrow y = 3\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, we need **positive integers**, so \\(y = 3\\) is valid. Therefore, \\(x = y + 3 = 6\\).\n\n**Sum Calculation:**\n\n- \\(3 + 6 = 9\\)\n\n**Checking:**\n\n- **Product:** \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\) \u2705\n- **Difference:** \\(6 - 3 = 3\\) \u2705\n- **Sum:** \\(3 + 6 = 9\\) \u2705\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth methods agree.
