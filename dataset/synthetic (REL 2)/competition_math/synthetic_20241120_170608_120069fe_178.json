Let's tackle this problem the way we naturally would when encountering a math question\u2014brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their validity, checking our work as we progress, and adjusting our approach if needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, the question asks for the probability that a randomly selected number from the set \\( \\{50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 999\\} \\) is a two-digit number. \n\nMy initial reactions are:\n\n- **Understanding the Set:** The set starts at 50 and goes up to 999. So, it includes all numbers in that range.\n  \n- **Identifying Two-Digit Numbers:** Only numbers from 50 to 99 are two-digit. This makes me think about how to determine the total number of two-digit numbers within the given range.\n\n- **Calculating Probability:** To find the probability, I need to compare the number of favorable outcomes (two-digit numbers) to the total number of possible outcomes (all numbers in the set).\n\nAt this point, I'm considering:\n\n1. **Counting Method:** Count the number of two-digit numbers and divide by the total number of numbers in the set.\n  \n2. **Probability Definition:** Use the basic probability formula \\( P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} \\).\n\n3. **Alternative Approaches:** Perhaps considering the complement (i.e., calculating the probability of selecting a three-digit number and subtracting from 1) might be useful.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure which method will be the most straightforward. Let's explore these options.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Direct Counting of Two-Digit Numbers**\n\n- **Plan:** Count how many numbers are two-digit (from 50 to 99) and divide by the total numbers in the set.\n\n**Strategy 2: Using the Complement Approach**\n\n- **Plan:** Calculate the probability of selecting a three-digit number (from 100 to 999) and subtract that probability from 1.\n\n**Strategy 3: Visualizing the Number Range**\n\n- **Plan:** Maybe sketching or breaking down the range into two-digit and three-digit parts could help visualize the problem better.\n\nThinking about these strategies:\n\n- **Direct Counting** seems straightforward but I need to ensure I accurately count the two-digit numbers.\n  \n- **Complement Approach** might simplify the problem by reducing the number of favorable outcomes to just the three-digit numbers.\n  \n- **Visualizing the Range** could provide a sanity check on our calculations.\n\nI think starting with **Strategy 1: Direct Counting** makes sense. If I run into issues, I can switch to the complement approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementing Strategy 1: Direct Counting**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Total Number of Outcomes**\n\n- **Thought Process:** I need to count all the numbers from 50 to 999.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total numbers} = 999 - 50 + 1 = 950\n  \\]\n\n  (Adding 1 to include both endpoints)\n\n- **Check:** Does 950 make sense? Yes, because it's a large range, starting from 50 up to 999.\n\n**Step 2: Count the Favorable Outcomes (Two-Digit Numbers)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Now, I need to count all the two-digit numbers from 50 to 99.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Two-digit numbers} = 99 - 50 + 1 = 50\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Wait, does counting from 50 to 99 give me exactly 50 numbers? Let me think...\n\n  - **Reflection:** Yes, because 50 to 99 is inclusive, and 99 - 50 = 49, adding 1 gives 50.\n\n  - **Alternative Check:** List a few numbers\u201450, 51, ..., 99\u2014yup, that adds up to 50.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Using the probability formula \\( P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} \\).\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  P(\\text{two-digit number}) = \\frac{50}{950}\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplification:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{50}{950} = \\frac{5}{95} = \\frac{1}{19}\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Does this fraction make sense? Let's simplify step-by-step:\n\n  - Divide both numerator and denominator by 10:\n    \n    \\[\n    \\frac{50}{950} = \\frac{5}{95}\n    \\]\n  \n  - Divide both by 5:\n    \n    \\[\n    \\frac{5}{95} = \\frac{1}{19}\n    \\]\n\n  - **Reflection:** Yes, \\( \\frac{1}{19} \\) seems reasonable. It's a reduced fraction.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\n- **Quick Check:** The probability of \\( \\frac{1}{19} \\) means there's one chance in nineteen to pick a two-digit number. Given the large range and that only 50 numbers are two-digit, that seems plausible.\n\n- **Deeper Reflection:** To be sure, I could think about the proportion of two-digit numbers relative to the entire set. \n\n  - **Proportion Insight:** \\( \\frac{50}{950} = \\frac{1}{19} \\) implies that about 5.26% of the numbers are two-digit. Given the total range, that feels right.\n\n- **Alternative Approach Verification:** Just to confirm, let's consider the complement approach briefly:\n\n  - **Step:** Calculate the probability of picking a three-digit number.\n\n  - **Calculation:** Three-digit numbers are from 100 to 999, so:\n    \n    \\[\n    \\text{Three-digit numbers} = 999 - 100 + 1 = 900\n    \\]\n    \n    \\[\n    P(\\text{three-digit number}) = \\frac{900}{950} = \\frac{90}{95} = \\frac{18}{19}\n    \\]\n    \n  - **Complement:** \n\n    \\[\n    P(\\text{two-digit number}) = 1 - \\frac{18}{19} = \\frac{1}{19}\n    \\]\n\n- **Conclusion:** Both methods yield the same probability \\( \\frac{1}{19} \\). This consistency reinforces the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Strategy Reflection:** Starting with direct counting was effective. The complement approach also confirmed the solution, providing a nice check.\n\n- **Potential Mistakes:** Initially, I hesitated about whether counting from 50 to 99 gave exactly 50 numbers, but verifying with simple calculations clarified that.\n\n- **Learning Point:** It's always helpful to approach a problem from multiple angles, especially when the first method feels uncertain. This ensures accuracy and builds confidence in the solution.\n\n- **Final Answer:** The probability that a randomly selected number from the set is a two-digit number is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}\n\\]\n\nBy thinking through each step, checking calculations, and being open to adjusting strategies, we arrived at the correct solution. This approach not only worked but also provided a thorough understanding of the problem and its nuances.",

  "ground_truth": "To count the number of numbers in this set, we subtract 49 from all of the numbers, giving the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 950 \\}$, making it obvious that there are 950 numbers total. Furthermore, the set $\\{ 50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 98, 99 \\}$ corresponds to the more easily counted $\\{ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 49, 50 \\}$ by subtracting 49. So, the probability of selecting a two-digit number is $\\frac{50}{950} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$."
