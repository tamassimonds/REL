    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll begin by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each one, checking if it's correct, and adjusting the approach as needed. Let's think this through like a human would\u2014messy, with plenty of exploration, mistakes, and \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem states that the parabola defined by \\( y = ax^2 + 6 \\) is **tangent** to the line \\( y = x \\). My initial reaction is that this involves the intersection of a parabola and a line, where they touch at exactly one point. \n\n**Key Concepts That Come to Mind:**\n\n- **Tangent Lines:** A line is tangent to a curve if it touches the curve at exactly one point and has the same slope as the curve at that point.\n- **Quadratic Equations:** The equation of the parabola is quadratic in terms of \\( x \\), and the line is linear.\n- **Discriminant of Equations:** When setting the equations equal to find points of intersection, the discriminant of the resulting quadratic equation can determine the number of solutions (zero, one, or two).\n\nHonestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. It looks familiar, like problems I've tackled involving tangents and parabolas, but there are multiple ways to approach it\u2014perhaps algebraically or graphically. I'll explore both and see which feels more straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Setting Equations Equal**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nThe most direct approach I can think of is to set the two equations equal to find the points of intersection. Since the line is tangent to the parabola, there should be exactly one point where they intersect.\n\n**Setting Up the Equations:**\n\n\\[\nax^2 + 6 = x\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging the Equation:**\n\n\\[\nax^2 - x + 6 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, we have a quadratic equation in the standard form \\( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 \\), where:\n\n- \\( A = a \\)\n- \\( B = -1 \\)\n- \\( C = 6 \\)\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nWait a minute\u2014this looks like a typical quadratic equation problem. To ensure that the line is tangent to the parabola, the discriminant of this equation should be zero (because a zero discriminant indicates exactly one solution).\n\n**Checking the Understanding:**\n\nDoes setting the equations equal capture the condition of tangency? Yes, because for tangency, the line must touch the parabola at exactly one point, which implies the quadratic equation has a double root.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating the Discriminant**\n\n**Formula for the Discriminant:**\n\nThe discriminant \\( D \\) of a quadratic equation \\( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nD = B^2 - 4AC\n\\]\n\n**Plugging in the Values:**\n\n\\[\nD = (-1)^2 - 4(a)(6) = 1 - 24a\n\\]\n\n**Setting the Discriminant to Zero:**\n\nFor the line to be tangent to the parabola, the discriminant must be zero:\n\n\\[\n1 - 24a = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( a \\):**\n\n\\[\n24a = 1 \\\\\na = \\frac{1}{24}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Before moving on, let me quickly check if \\( a = \\frac{1}{24} \\) would actually make the line \\( y = x \\) tangent to the parabola \\( y = \\frac{1}{24}x^2 + 6 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Verification**\n\n**Checking the Parabola Equation:**\n\nWith \\( a = \\frac{1}{24} \\), the parabola is:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{24}x^2 + 6\n\\]\n\n**Setting Up for Intersection:**\n\nNow, let's find the point where the line \\( y = x \\) intersects this parabola:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{24}x^2 + 6 = x \\\\\n\\frac{1}{24}x^2 - x + 6 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the Discriminant Again:**\n\n\\[\nD = (-1)^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{1}{24} \\times 6 \\\\\nD = 1 - \\frac{24}{24} \\\\\nD = 1 - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion of Verification:**\n\nThe discriminant is indeed zero, confirming that there is exactly one point of intersection. This supports our earlier calculation.\n\n**But Wait...**\n\nI just realized I need to ensure that the parabolas actually open upward or downward appropriately. However, since \\( a = \\frac{1}{24} \\) is positive, the parabola opens upward, which aligns with having a tangent line \\( y = x \\) that intersects above the vertex.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nDoes \\( a = \\frac{1}{24} \\) lead to a valid single point of tangency? Yes, everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring a Different Strategy: Graphical Approach**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nPerhaps another way to confirm our solution is by visualizing the problem. If I plot both the parabola and the line, the point where they touch should confirm the value of \\( a \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nGraphing might not be precise, but it can provide a good intuition check. If the graph shows only one point of intersection, it's likely that our calculated \\( a \\) is correct.\n\n**Action:**\n\nI'll describe what the graph would look like:\n\n- **Parabola:** \\( y = \\frac{1}{24}x^2 + 6 \\) opens upward, with a vertex at \\( (0, 6) \\).\n- **Line:** \\( y = x \\) passes through the origin with a slope of 1.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\nThe line \\( y = x \\) should touch the parabola at exactly one point. Given our calculated \\( a \\), this should hold true.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes the graphing approach confirm our algebraic solution? While I can't graph it here, mentally picturing it, the line should touch the parabola just above the vertex, making \\( a = \\frac{1}{24} \\) plausible.\n\n**Conclusion of Alternative Strategy:**\n\nGraphically, the line and parabola should intersect at one point, consistent with our earlier calculation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014setting the equations equal and verifying through the discriminant, and by considering a graphical approach\u2014I've arrived at the same conclusion: \\( a = \\frac{1}{24} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does the discriminant approach work?** Yes, it directly leads to the needed condition for tangency.\n- **Is the graphical approach helpful?** It reinforces the algebraic solution by providing a visual check.\n- **Did checking and verifying throughout ensure correctness?** Absolutely, it prevented potential mistakes and confirmed the validity of the solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{24}}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step exploration, with continuous checking and reflection, led to a confident and accurate solution.",
