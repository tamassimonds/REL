    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step-by-step. I'll walk through my thought process as naturally as possible, reflecting, brainstorming, and checking my work along the way\u2014just like I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n- **Understanding the Question:**  \n  We have a circle with an area of \\( x \\) square units and a circumference of \\( y \\) units. The sum \\( x + y = 80\\pi \\). The goal is to find the radius of the circle in units.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:**  \n  This reminds me of formulas related to circles that I\u2019ve encountered before. Specifically, I recall that the area and circumference are both related to the radius \\( r \\) of the circle. I think I should start by recalling those formulas.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Use the Area and Circumference Formulas:**  \n     Relate both to the radius and set up equations.\n  \n  2. **Express \\( x + y \\) in Terms of \\( r \\):**  \n     Substitute the area and circumference formulas to express everything in terms of \\( r \\).\n\n  3. **Algebraic Manipulation:**  \n     Solve the resulting equation for \\( r \\).\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Does this approach seem straightforward? Let me think\u2014using the formulas should work, but I need to ensure the equations are set up correctly. If I make a mistake early on, the final answer will be off.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming and Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n- **Strategy 1: Use Area and Circumference Formulas Separately**  \n  - **Area \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\)**  \n    So, \\( x = \\pi r^2 \\).\n  \n  - **Circumference \\( C = 2\\pi r \\)**  \n    Thus, \\( y = 2\\pi r \\).\n\n- **Combining Them:**  \n  \\( x + y = \\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r = 80\\pi \\).\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Wait, by combining them like this, I get an equation in terms of \\( r \\). That seems like a good starting point. But let me ensure everything lines up.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Setup**\n\n- **Does the Equation Make Sense?**  \n  \\( \\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r = 80\\pi \\)  \n  - I can factor out \\( \\pi \\):  \n    \\( \\pi (r^2 + 2r) = 80\\pi \\)  \n  - This simplifies to:  \n    \\( r^2 + 2r = 80 \\)\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  - Removing \\( \\pi \\) from both sides is valid since \\( \\pi \\neq 0 \\).\n  - The resulting equation \\( r^2 + 2r = 80 \\) looks like a standard quadratic equation format. That seems correct.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  This setup seems solid. Now, I can solve for \\( r \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the Equation**\n\n- **Writing the Quadratic Equation:**  \n  \\( r^2 + 2r - 80 = 0 \\)\n\n- **Thinking About Solution Methods:**  \n  - **Factorization:**  \n    Can this be factored easily?\n  \n  - **Quadratic Formula:**  \n    If factoring is tricky, the quadratic formula might be needed.\n\n- **Attempting Factorization:**\n  - Looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-80\\) and add up to \\(2\\).\n  - Possible pairs:  \n    - \\(8 \\times -10\\) \u2192 \\(8 + (-10) = -2\\) (Doesn\u2019t work)\n    - \\(5 \\times -16\\) \u2192 \\(5 + (-16) = -11\\) (Doesn\u2019t work)\n    - Wait, maybe \\(10 \\times -8\\) \u2192 \\(10 + (-8) = 2\\) (This works!)\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Factorization seems to work here. Let me write it out.\n\n- **Factoring the Quadratic:**  \n  \\( (r + 10)(r - 8) = 0 \\)\n\n- **Finding Solutions:**  \n  \\( r + 10 = 0 \\) or \\( r - 8 = 0 \\)  \n  Therefore, \\( r = -10 \\) or \\( r = 8 \\)\n\n- **Check:**  \n  The radius can't be negative, so \\( r = -10 \\) is impractical in this context.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The only feasible solution is \\( r = 8 \\) units.\n\n---\n\n### **Cross-Verification**\n\n- **Quick Check with Original Equations:**\n  - **Radius \\( r = 8 \\):**\n    - **Area \\( A = \\pi (8)^2 = 64\\pi \\)**\n    - **Circumference \\( C = 2\\pi (8) = 16\\pi \\)**\n  \n  - **Sum \\( x + y = 64\\pi + 16\\pi = 80\\pi \\)**  \n    This matches the given condition.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  The calculations align perfectly with the given condition in the problem. This confirms that the radius \\( r = 8 \\) units is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Does Everything Add Up?**  \n  Yes, by using the area and circumference formulas, I was able to set up a quadratic equation that factored nicely to give a valid radius.\n\n- **Was There Any Confusion or Mistake?**  \n  Initially, I considered factoring might not work and thought about using the quadratic formula. However, recognizing the factor that fits the requirements helped in finding the solution cleanly.\n\n- **Key Takeaways:**\n  - Always start by relating given quantities to known formulas.\n  - Factorization can simplify solving quadratic equations.\n  - Checking each step ensures accuracy and builds confidence in the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe radius of the circle is **8 units**.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps in understanding the thought process behind solving the problem step-by-step, including brainstorming, exploring different strategies, checking, and reflecting along the way.",
