    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it for the first time. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they\u2019re working, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see this problem:\n\n- **Square A** has a **perimeter of 24 cm**.\n- **Square B** has an **area equal to one-fourth** the area of Square A.\n- I need to find the **perimeter of Square B**.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n\n- **Perimeter of Square A** is given, which means I can find its side length.\n- **Square B** has an area that's one-fourth of Square A's area. So, there's a relationship between their areas.\n- I need to connect the side lengths and perimeters through their areas.\n\nThis looks familiar\u2014calculating side lengths from perimeters and then relating areas of squares. It reminds me of problems where you deal with proportions and properties of squares.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Side Length of Square A**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I know the perimeter of a square is the total length around it, which is four times the side length. \n\nWait, let me recall how the perimeter relates to the side length:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\times \\text{side length}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nGiven the perimeter is 24 cm:\n\n\\[\n24 \\text{ cm} = 4 \\times \\text{side length}\n\\]\n\nSolving for the side length:\n\n\\[\n\\text{side length} = \\frac{24 \\text{ cm}}{4} = 6 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat makes sense because if each side is 6 cm, the perimeter would indeed be 24 cm. This part checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Area of Square A**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have the side length of Square A, I can find its area using the formula for the area of a square.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{side length} \\times \\text{side length}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of Square A} = 6 \\text{ cm} \\times 6 \\text{ cm} = 36 \\text{ cm}^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems correct because \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\). The area calculation aligns with the side length.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Area of Square B**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Square B's area is one-fourth the area of Square A. So, I need to divide Square A's area by 4.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of Square B} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\text{Area of Square A}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of Square B} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 36 \\text{ cm}^2 = 9 \\text{ cm}^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDividing 36 by 4 gives 9, which is consistent with the problem's requirements. This part checks out too.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Side Length of Square B**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the side length of Square B, I can use the area formula again. I know the area is 9 cm\u00b2, so I need to find the side length whose square is 9 cm\u00b2.\n\n\\[\n\\text{side length} = \\sqrt{\\text{Area}}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{side length of Square B} = \\sqrt{9 \\text{ cm}^2} = 3 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nTaking the square root of 9 cm\u00b2 gives 3 cm. This seems reasonable because if the area is 9 cm\u00b2, the side length should be 3 cm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Perimeter of Square B**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have the side length of Square B, I can calculate its perimeter using the perimeter formula for squares.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\times \\text{side length}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter of Square B} = 4 \\times 3 \\text{ cm} = 12 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nMultiplying 3 cm by 4 gives 12 cm. This seems correct and aligns with the properties of squares.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring Everything Makes Sense**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let me quickly review each step to ensure the calculations are correct and the relationships hold true.\n\n1. **Square A's Perimeter:**  \n   - Given: 24 cm\n   - Side length calculated: 6 cm \u2192 \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\) cm (checks out)\n\n2. **Square A's Area:**  \n   - Side length: 6 cm \u2192 \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) cm\u00b2 (correct)\n\n3. **Square B's Area:**  \n   - One-fourth of Square A's area: \\(\\frac{36}{4} = 9\\) cm\u00b2 (correct)\n\n4. **Square B's Side Length:**  \n   - Square root of 9 cm\u00b2: 3 cm (correct)\n\n5. **Square B's Perimeter:**  \n   - \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) cm (correct)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The calculations are consistent with the properties of squares, and the relationships between the areas and perimeters hold true.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategies and Dead Ends**\n\n**Exploring Different Approaches:**\n\nInitially, I considered using the ratio of areas to directly find the side lengths without calculating the areas explicitly. But recalling that the area is proportional to the square of the side length helped confirm the steps I took.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nUsing the perimeter to find the side length first was straightforward and led naturally to finding the area required for Square B. Trying to skip steps might have led to confusion, so this step-by-step approach was effective.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically finding the side lengths and areas of both squares and checking each step, I've determined that the perimeter of Square B is **12 cm**. This step-by-step method ensured accuracy and clarity, reflecting a human-like thought process with brainstorming, reflection, and verification.",

  "ground_truth": "Since square $A$ has a perimeter of 24 cm and all its sides are equal in length, each side measures $24/4=6$ cm. The area of square $A$ is thus $6\\cdot6=36$ square cm. Thus, the area of square $B$ is $36/4=9$ square cm. So each side of square $B$ measures $\\sqrt{9}=3$ cm. Finally, the perimeter of square $B$ is $4\\cdot3=\\boxed{12}$ cm."
