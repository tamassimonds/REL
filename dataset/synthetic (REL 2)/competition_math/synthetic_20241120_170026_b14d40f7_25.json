    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll begin by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting along the way, and checking my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nThe problem states:\n\n> The quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + 20x + c = 0 \\) has **exactly one solution**. If \\( a + c = 29 \\), and \\( a < c \\), find the ordered pair \\( (a, c) \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Quadratic Equations with One Solution:** I recall that for a quadratic equation to have exactly one solution, its **discriminant** must be zero. The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) for the general quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is \\( b^2 - 4ac \\). So, if \\(\\Delta = 0\\), there\u2019s exactly one solution.\n  \n- **Given Information:** The coefficient of \\( x \\) is 20, so \\( b = 20 \\). This means the discriminant becomes \\( 20^2 - 4ac = 400 - 4ac \\).\n\n- **Equation Setup:** Since we need the discriminant to be zero for there to be exactly one solution, I can set up the equation:\n  \n  \\[\n  400 - 4ac = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  Simplifying this:\n  \n  \\[\n  4ac = 400 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad ac = 100\n  \\]\n  \n- **Relating \\( a \\) and \\( c \\):** We also have another equation from the problem: \\( a + c = 29 \\). So now, I have a system of two equations:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\begin{cases}\n  ac = 100 \\\\\n  a + c = 29\n  \\end{cases}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Objective:** I need to solve this system to find \\( a \\) and \\( c \\), ensuring that \\( a < c \\).\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**\n\nYeah, this seems like a solid starting point because I\u2019m leveraging the property of the discriminant for quadratic equations to set up a solvable system. But let me proceed and see if it leads me to the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Approach: Use Substitution or Elimination**\n\nI can solve these equations using either substitution or elimination. Given that \\( a + c = 29 \\), substitution might be straightforward here. Let\u2019s try that.\n\n**Applying Substitution:**\n\n1. From \\( a + c = 29 \\), I can express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n   \n   \\[\n   c = 29 - a\n   \\]\n   \n2. Now, substitute \\( c = 29 - a \\) into the equation \\( ac = 100 \\):\n   \n   \\[\n   a(29 - a) = 100\n   \\]\n   \n3. Expand the equation:\n   \n   \\[\n   29a - a^2 = 100\n   \\]\n   \n4. Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:\n   \n   \\[\n   a^2 - 29a + 100 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks good. I\u2019ve transformed the system into a standard quadratic equation. Now, I can solve for \\( a \\) using the quadratic formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI know the quadratic formula is:\n   \n\\[\na = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n   \nBut wait\u2014this formula is typically used to find the roots of the equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\). Here, I\u2019m solving for \\( a \\), but I used \\( a \\) as the coefficient in the quadratic equation. This might be confusing. To avoid mixing things up, I'll denote the variable I'm solving for as \\( m \\) instead of \\( a \\).\n\n**Reassigning Variables:**\n\nLet\u2019s pretend the quadratic equation is actually:\n\n\\[\nm^2 - 29m + 100 = 0\n\\]\n   \nOr simply use a different letter to represent the variable, but for clarity, I\u2019ll proceed with \\( m \\).\n\n**Applying the Quadratic Formula:**\n\n1. Identify coefficients:\n   \n   - \\( A = 1 \\)\n   - \\( B = -29 \\)\n   - \\( C = 100 \\)\n   \n2. Plugging into the formula:\n   \n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{-(-29) \\pm \\sqrt{(-29)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 100}}{2 \\times 1}\n   \\]\n   \n3. Calculating step by step:\n   \n   - \\( (-29)^2 = 841 \\)\n   - \\( 4 \\times 1 \\times 100 = 400 \\)\n   - \\( 841 - 400 = 441 \\)\n   - \\( \\sqrt{441} = 21 \\)\n   \n4. So, the equation becomes:\n   \n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{29 \\pm 21}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n5. This gives two possible solutions:\n   \n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad m = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n   \\]\n   \n**Checking Which is \\( a \\) and Which is \\( c \\):**\n\n- We have \\( a + c = 29 \\) and \\( ac = 100 \\).\n- Let\u2019s list the possible pairs:\n  \n  - If \\( a = 25 \\) and \\( c = 4 \\), then \\( 25 + 4 = 29 \\) and \\( 25 \\times 4 = 100 \\).\n  - If \\( a = 4 \\) and \\( c = 25 \\), then \\( 4 + 25 = 29 \\) and \\( 4 \\times 25 = 100 \\).\n\n**But Wait\u2014Condition \\( a < c \\):**\n\nThe problem specifies \\( a < c \\), so we must have \\( a = 4 \\) and \\( c = 25 \\).\n\n**Ordered Pair:**\n\n\\[\n(a, c) = (4, 25)\n\\]\n   \n**Does This Seem Correct?**\n\nLet me quickly check:\n\n- **Sum:** \\( 4 + 25 = 29 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Product:** \\( 4 \\times 25 = 100 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Discriminant Condition:** \n   \n  \\[\n  \\Delta = 20^2 - 4 \\times 4 \\times 25 = 400 - 400 = 0\n  \\]\n   \n  Which confirms exactly one solution exists. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. The ordered pair \\( (a, c) = (4, 25) \\) satisfies all the conditions of the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Reflecting on the Approach**\n\n**Was this the Best Method?**\n\n- **Alternatives:** I could have used the elimination method to solve the system of equations, but substitution seemed more straightforward given the problem's structure.\n  \n- **Verification:** After finding the solutions, I double-checked against the given conditions (sum and product, as well as \\( a < c \\)) to ensure validity.\n\n- **Mistakes and Corrections:** Initially, I considered using the quadratic formula directly on the original equation, but recognizing the need to assign different variables helped clarify the solution process.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy setting up the system based on the discriminant condition and the given sum, I was able to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) effectively. Reflecting and checking each step ensured that the solution is correct and aligns with all given conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Solution:**\n\n\\[\n(a, c) = (4, 25)\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThrough a systematic approach\u2014brainstorming, solving the system of equations, applying the quadratic formula, and continually reflecting and checking the work\u2014I arrived at the ordered pair \\( (4, 25) \\). This method ensured that all conditions were met, leading to a correct and verified solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the quadratic has only one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero. The discriminant is $b^2-4ac=400-4ac=0$, so $ac=\\frac{400}{4}=100$. We need to find $a$ and $c$ given $a+c=29$ and $ac=100$. We could write a quadratic equation and solve, but instead we rely on clever algebraic manipulations: Since $a+c=29$, we have $$(a+c)^2=a^2+c^2+2ac=29^2=841.$$We subtract $4ac=400$ from each side to find $$a^2+c^2+2ac-4ac=a^2+c^2-2ac=841-400=441.$$We recognize each side as a square, so we take the square root of both sides: $$\\sqrt{a^2+c^2-2ac}=\\sqrt{(c-a)^2}=c-a=\\sqrt{441}=21.$$(Technically we should take the positive and negative square root of both sides, but since $c>a$ we know $c-a>0$.) Thus we have  \\begin{align*}\nc-a&=21\\\\\nc+a&=29\n\\end{align*}Summing these equations gives \\begin{align*}\n2c&=50\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad c&=25,\n\\end{align*}and $a=29-c=4$. Thus our ordered pair $(a,c)$ is $\\boxed{(4,25)}$."
