I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work often, and adjust my methods as needed\u2014just like human problem-solving.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nLooking at the problem: \n\\[\n(15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5)\n\\]\n\nMy initial reaction is to **simplify the expression by removing the parentheses**. It looks like we're dealing with a polynomial subtraction, so I should be careful with the signs, especially since there\u2019s a negative sign in front of the second parenthesis.\n\nBut honestly, I'm a bit unsure if that's the only step needed. Maybe after simplifying, I\u2019ll need to **factor the resulting expression**, but let's start with simplifying it first and see where that leads.\n\n### **Step 1: Simplifying the Expression**\n\n**Thought process:**  \nTo simplify, I need to distribute the negative sign across the second parenthesis. This reminds me of distributing in algebra, where each term inside the parentheses gets multiplied by the number outside.\n\n**Action:**\n\\[\n(15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5) = 15x^3 + 80x - 5 + 4x^3 - 4x + 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, that looks right. I combined the like terms by flipping the signs of the second expression. Let me double-check:\n\n- Original: \\( (15x^3 + 80x - 5) \\)\n- Subtracting: \\( (-4x^3 + 4x - 5) \\)\n\nWhen I distribute the negative:\n- \\( -(-4x^3) = +4x^3 \\)\n- \\( -4x = -4x \\)\n- \\( -(-5) = +5 \\)\n\nSo, combining them:  \n\\( 15x^3 + 80x - 5 + 4x^3 - 4x + 5 \\)  \nYup, that seems correct.\n\n### **Step 2: Combining Like Terms**\n\n**Thought process:**  \nNow, I need to combine the like terms to simplify the expression further. This should make it easier to see if factoring is necessary.\n\n**Action:**\n\\[\n(15x^3 + 4x^3) + (80x - 4x) + (-5 + 5) = 19x^3 + 76x + 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nCombining like terms:\n\n- **Cubic Terms:** \\( 15x^3 + 4x^3 = 19x^3 \\)\n- **Linear Terms:** \\( 80x - 4x = 76x \\)\n- **Constant Terms:** \\( -5 + 5 = 0 \\)\n\nSo, the simplified expression is:\n\\[\n19x^3 + 76x\n\\]\n\nWait a minute\u2014there's no constant term left. That\u2019s interesting. Maybe this expression can be factored further because everything else looks neat.\n\n### **Step 3: Factoring the Simplified Expression**\n\n**Thought process:**  \nNow that I have \\( 19x^3 + 76x \\), I notice that there are **common factors** in both terms. This signals that factoring could be possible. I remember from previous problems that factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) is usually a good first step.\n\n**Action:**  \nFirst, identify the GCF of \\( 19x^3 \\) and \\( 76x \\).\n\n- **Coefficients:** 19 and 76\n  - \\( 19 \\times 4 = 76 \\), so the GCF is 19.\n  \n- **Variables:** Both terms have \\( x \\), but \\( x^3 \\) and \\( x \\) only share \\( x \\) as the lowest exponent.\n\nSo, the GCF is \\( 19x \\).\n\n**Factoring out \\( 19x \\):**\n\\[\n19x(x^2 + 4)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks like a valid factorization. Let me double-check to ensure that I've factored correctly.\n\n- Original: \\( 19x^3 + 76x \\)\n- After factoring out \\( 19x \\): \\( 19x(x^2 + 4) \\)\n\nDistributing back:\n\\[\n19x \\times x^2 + 19x \\times 4 = 19x^3 + 76x\n\\]\nYes, that matches the simplified expression. So, factoring out \\( 19x \\) seems correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Factored Expression**\n\n**Thought process:**  \nTo ensure that the factoring is correct, I should verify by expanding \\( 19x(x^2 + 4) \\) back to its original form.\n\n**Action:**\n\\[\n19x(x^2 + 4) = 19x^3 + 76x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nPerfect! Expanding \\( 19x(x^2 + 4) \\) gives me back the original simplified expression \\( 19x^3 + 76x \\). That confirms the factoring is correct.\n\n### **Step 5: Checking for Further Factoring**\n\n**Thought process:**  \nNow, looking at \\( x^2 + 4 \\), I wonder if it can be factored further. I recall that \\( x^2 + a^2 \\) can sometimes be factored using complex numbers. But wait, the problem doesn\u2019t specify if complex numbers are allowed, so I might have to leave it as is unless told otherwise. However, factoring over the **real numbers**, \\( x^2 + 4 \\) doesn't factor nicely because it's not a difference of squares.\n\n**Action:**  \nLeave the expression as \\( 19x(x^2 + 4) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nUnless we're allowed to use complex numbers, \\( x^2 + 4 \\) doesn\u2019t factor over the reals. If complex numbers are permissible, it could be factored as \\( (x + 2i)(x - 2i) \\), but since that's not mentioned, I\u2019ll stick with \\( x^2 + 4 \\).\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought process:**  \nLet me quickly review each step to ensure everything is correct.\n\n1. **Simplified the Expression:**  \n   \\[\n   (15x^3 + 80x - 5) - (-4x^3 + 4x - 5) = 15x^3 + 80x - 5 + 4x^3 - 4x + 5 = 19x^3 + 76x\n   \\]\n\n2. **Factored the Simplified Expression:**  \n   \\[\n   19x(x^2 + 4)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Verified the Factored Expression:**  \n   \\[\n   19x(x^2 + 4) = 19x^3 + 76x\n   \\]\n\nEverything seems to align perfectly. The factored expression accurately represents the simplified polynomial.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe completely factored form of the given expression is:\n\\[\n19x(x^2 + 4)\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nBy following a systematic approach\u2014simplifying the expression, factoring out the greatest common factor, and verifying each step\u2014I ensured that the final factored form is correct. Checking along the way helped catch any potential mistakes, and considering whether further factoring was possible ensured completeness. This methodical thinking mimics natural human problem-solving, making it both effective and reliable.",
