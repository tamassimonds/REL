    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether each approach is working, and make adjustments as needed. Think of it like a conversation with myself, where I'm exploring possibilities, checking my work, and ensuring I'm on the right track.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, here's the problem: \n\nGiven \n\\[ \nA = 2 + i, \\quad O = -4, \\quad P = -i, \\quad S = 2 + 4i, \n\\]  \nfind \n\\[ \nA - O + P + S. \n\\]\n\nWhen I first look at this, I notice that all the given values are complex numbers except \\( O \\), which is a real number. This reminds me of operations involving complex numbers, perhaps adding or subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately. \n\nBut then I think, \"Wait, is there a standard way to handle this like with vectors or matrices?\" I realize that this isn't exactly vector addition because we're dealing with complex numbers, but the idea of combining real and imaginary components is similar.\n\nAnother thought that crosses my mind is to group the terms in pairs to simplify the calculation: maybe handle \\( A - O \\) first and then add \\( P + S \\). But then I wonder, would it be easier to just proceed linearly through the expression?\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Computation:** \n   - Simply follow the order of operations: compute \\( A - O \\), then add \\( P \\), and finally add \\( S \\).\n\n2. **Grouping Terms:**\n   - Group the terms to see if combining some parts first simplifies the overall calculation.\n\n3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n   - Calculate the real and imaginary parts separately to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Using Visual Representation:**\n   - Think of the numbers as vectors in the complex plane, though this might be overcomplicating things for a simple addition.\n\n### **Exploring the First Strategy: Direct Computation**\n\nLet's start with the **Direct Computation** approach. It's straightforward: follow the expression as written and compute step by step.\n\n**Step 1:** Compute \\( A - O \\)\n\n\\[\nA - O = (2 + i) - (-4) \n\\]\n\nWait a moment... in subtracting \\(-4\\), it's like adding \\(4\\) because subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its positive counterpart. Let me write this out more clearly:\n\n\\[\nA - O = 2 + i + 4 = (2 + 4) + i = 6 + i \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, that seems right. Adding a real number to a complex number works by adding the real parts together.\n\n**Step 2:** Add \\( P + S \\)\n\n\\[\nP + S = (-i) + (2 + 4i) \n\\]\n\nHere, I'm adding two complex numbers: \\( -i \\) and \\( 2 + 4i \\). Let's separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n\\[\nP + S = 2 + (4i - i) = 2 + 3i \n\\]\n\n**Check:** Adding the real parts: \\(2\\) remains \\(2\\). Adding the imaginary parts: \\(4i - i = 3i\\). This looks correct.\n\n**Step 3:** Combine the results from Step 1 and Step 2\n\n\\[\n(A - O) + (P + S) = (6 + i) + (2 + 3i) \n\\]\n\nAgain, let's separate the real and imaginary parts:\n\n\\[\n= (6 + 2) + (i + 3i) = 8 + 4i \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, the final answer is \\(8 + 4i\\). That feels good. Let me double-check to ensure each step logically follows the previous one and that I didn't miss anything.\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\nQuick check:\n\n- **Step 1:** \\( A - O = 6 + i \\) \u2014 adding \\(-4\\) to \\(2 + i\\) resulted in \\(6 + i\\). Correct.\n- **Step 2:** \\( P + S = 2 + 3i \\) \u2014 combining \\(-i\\) and \\(2 + 4i\\) gives \\(2 + 3i\\). Correct.\n- **Step 3:** Combining \\(6 + i\\) and \\(2 + 3i\\) yields \\(8 + 4i\\). Correct.\n\nEverything checks out. The approach seems solid, and the calculations align with the properties of complex number addition and subtraction.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**\n\nJust to explore another method, let's see if separating the real and imaginary parts from the beginning would change the outcome.\n\n**Step 1:** Look at the expression \\( A - O + P + S \\)\n\n\\[\nA - O + P + S = (A - O) + (P + S) \n\\]\n\n**But really, let's separate each part:**\n\n- \\( A - O = (2 + i) - (-4) = 6 + i \\)\n- \\( P + S = (-i) + (2 + 4i) = 2 + 3i \\)\n\nAnd then combine:\n\n\\[\n(A - O) + (P + S) = (6 + i) + (2 + 3i) = 8 + 4i \n\\]\n\nWait, the result is the same. This suggests that regardless of how we approach it, as long as we correctly apply the operations step by step, the outcome remains consistent.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Consistency in Answers:** Both strategies led to the same final result: \\(8 + 4i\\). This consistency reassures me that the solution is correct.\n- **Reflection on Approach:** Starting with direct computation kept things straightforward. Considering alternative methods reinforced the validity of the initial approach.\n- **Checking for Mistakes:** Regular checking after each step ensured that any potential errors were caught early. For instance, initially realizing that subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart helped avoid common mistakes.\n- **Flexibility in Problem-Solving:** Being open to trying different strategies allowed for confirmation of the correct path. It also helped identify that separating real and imaginary parts wasn't necessary for this particular problem but could be useful for more complex expressions.\n\nIn conclusion, by methodically following through each step, exploring different strategies, and continuously checking the work, I've arrived at the correct answer: \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8 + 4i}\n\\] \n\nThis detailed, reflective process reflects a human-like approach, ensuring clarity and accuracy throughout the problem-solving journey.",
