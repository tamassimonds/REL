    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: **Find \\( |3 - 2i| \\cdot |3 + 2i| \\).**\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, my immediate reaction is to think about the properties of complex numbers and their magnitudes (or moduli). Here's what's swirling around in my mind:\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Value in Complex Numbers:**  \n   - I remember that the absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number \\( a + bi \\) is given by \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n   - So maybe I need to calculate \\( |3 - 2i| \\) and \\( |3 + 2i| \\) separately using this formula.\n\n2. **Exploring Multiplication of Magnitudes:**  \n   - There's a property of absolute values that says multiplying the magnitudes of two complex numbers is the same as finding the magnitude of their product:  \n     \\[\n     |z_1| \\cdot |z_2| = |z_1 \\cdot z_2|\n     \\]\n   - Perhaps I can use this property to simplify the calculation by finding the magnitude of the product \\( (3 - 2i)(3 + 2i) \\).\n\n3. **Considering the Conjugate Pair:**  \n   - I recall that multiplying a complex number by its conjugate yields a real number:  \n     \\[\n     (a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( 3 + 2i \\) is the conjugate of \\( 3 - 2i \\), maybe this approach will work neatly.\n\n4. **Checking for Alternative Methods:**  \n   - An alternative could be to expand the product directly and then find the modulus, but that seems more tedious.\n   - I think leveraging the properties of conjugates and magnitudes might be more efficient.\n\n### **Strategy Selection**\n\nAfter brainstorming, the most promising approach seems to be:\n\n- **Find the product \\( (3 - 2i)(3 + 2i) \\).**\n- **Calculate the magnitude of the resulting real number.**\n- **Alternatively, calculate the magnitudes of \\( 3 - 2i \\) and \\( 3 + 2i \\) separately and multiply them.**\n\nI'll start with the first method\u2014finding the product and its magnitude\u2014because it aligns well with the properties of complex numbers and seems straightforward. If this doesn't work out, I can always try the second method.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Product**\n\nLet's proceed with calculating the product:\n\n\\[\n(3 - 2i)(3 + 2i)\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nMultiplying a complex number by its conjugate should give me a real number. I expect the imaginary parts to cancel out.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 3 + 3 \\times 2i - 2i \\times 3 - 2i \\times 2i\n\\]\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n\\[\n9 + 6i - 6i - 4i^2\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**\n\n\\[\n9 + (6i - 6i) - 4(-1) \\quad \\text{(since \\( i^2 = -1 \\))}\n\\]\n\\[\n9 + 0 + 4 = 13\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, that seems to work perfectly. The imaginary parts canceled each other out, leaving me with a real number \\( 13 \\). This aligns with my expectation when multiplying a complex number by its conjugate.\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nHmm, \\( 13 \\) seems reasonable. It's a positive real number, and multiplying conjugates typically yields a simple result like this. Let's double-check by considering the alternative method.\n\n**Alternative Method Consideration:**  \nIf I were to find \\( |3 - 2i| \\) and \\( |3 + 2i| \\) separately:\n\n\\[\n|3 - 2i| = \\sqrt{3^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 4} = \\sqrt{13}\n\\]\n\\[\n|3 + 2i| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 4} = \\sqrt{13}\n\\]\n\\[\n|3 - 2i| \\cdot |3 + 2i| = \\sqrt{13} \\times \\sqrt{13} = 13\n\\]\n\n**Realization:**  \nBoth methods yield the same result\u2014\\( 13 \\). This confirms the correctness of the solution.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n**Checking Consistency:**  \nBoth strategies agree on the result, which adds confidence to the solution. The properties of absolute values and conjugates in complex numbers are functioning as expected.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n|3 - 2i| \\cdot |3 + 2i| = 13\n\\]\n\n**Ending Reflection:**  \nInitially, I considered directly expanding the product, but leveraging the property of conjugates made the calculation more straightforward. It's always good to explore different approaches and verify their correctness, as this ensures a robust solution. By checking both methods, I confirmed that the answer is indeed \\( 13 \\).\n\nIn conclusion, taking the time to brainstorm and reflect on different strategies led to a clear and accurate solution. Always checking and cross-verifying steps helps catch any potential errors early on, ensuring the final answer is correct.",
