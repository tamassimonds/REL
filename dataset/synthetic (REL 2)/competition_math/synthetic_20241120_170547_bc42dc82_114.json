    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem! The question is to simplify \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{4}}{\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{7}}\n\\]\n\nand then rationalize the denominator of the resulting fraction. \n\n## **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Properties of Square Roots:** I remember that multiplication under square roots can be combined, and the same goes for division. This might be helpful for simplifying the expression.\n\n2. **Rationalizing Denominators:** I've dealt with rationalizing square roots in the denominator before, so that part seems familiar.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Simplification:** I think simplifying each fraction individually before multiplying could make things clearer.\n\n4. **Alternative Strategies:** Maybe I can combine all the numerators and denominators into a single fraction before applying square root properties.\n\nInitially, I'm leaning towards combining the fractions step by step, checking along the way to ensure correctness. However, I'm also open to exploring different methods if the first doesn't seem right.\n\n## **Exploring the First Strategy: Simplify Each Fraction Individually**\n\nLet's start by simplifying each fraction one at a time:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{4}}{\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{7}}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** Simplifying each fraction separately seems straightforward. I can apply the property \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **First Fraction:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\n\\]\n\n2. **Second Fraction:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{4}}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{5}}\n\\]\n\n3. **Third Fraction:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{7}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{7}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This seems correct. Combining the numerators and denominators under a single square root aligns with the properties of square roots.\n\n## **Check:** Does This Approach Make Sense?\n\nSo far, it looks fine. Each fraction simplifies correctly using the square root property. But let's see if combining all fractions before simplification might be a better approach.\n\n## **Exploring an Alternative Strategy: Combine All Fractions First**\n\nAnother way to tackle this is by multiplying all numerators and denominators together into a single fraction before applying square root properties.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{5} \\cdot \\sqrt{7}}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** This method looks clean because it reduces the number of square roots to handle at once. Let's see how it compares.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Multiply Numerators:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{6} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 4 \\times 6} = \\sqrt{48}\n\\]\n\n2. **Multiply Denominators:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{5} \\cdot \\sqrt{7} = \\sqrt{3 \\times 5 \\times 7} = \\sqrt{105}\n\\]\n\n3. **Combine into Single Fraction:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{48}}{\\sqrt{105}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{48}{105}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Combining all fractions first simplifies the process by reducing square roots earlier. This might be more efficient, and the calculation seems correct.\n\n## **Check:** Is the Combined Approach Correct?\n\nBoth methods lead to the same simplified fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{48}{105}}\n\\]\n\nAt this point, both strategies are yielding consistent results. I feel confident that the combined approach is correct. However, let's proceed to rationalize the denominator to see if any discrepancies arise.\n\n## **Step 3: Rationalizing the Denominator**\n\nNow, let's rationalize the denominator of \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{48}{105}}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** Rationalizing involves eliminating square roots from the denominator. I remember multiplying the numerator and denominator by the square root of the denominator to achieve this.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Identify the Square Root in the Denominator:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{105}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply Both Numerator and Denominator by \\(\\sqrt{105}\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{48}{105}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{105}}{\\sqrt{105}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{48} \\cdot \\sqrt{105}}{105}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Numerator:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{48} \\cdot \\sqrt{105} = \\sqrt{48 \\times 105}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate \\(48 \\times 105\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   48 \\times 105 = 5040\n   \\]\n\n5. **Combine into Simplified Fraction:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\sqrt{5040}}{105}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:** This seems correct. The denominator is now rationalized. However, \\(\\sqrt{5040}\\) can be simplified further by factoring it into its prime components.\n\n## **Step 4: Simplifying \\(\\sqrt{5040}\\)**\n\nLet's break down \\(\\sqrt{5040}\\) to see if it can be simplified.\n\n**Thought Process:** Simplifying square roots by factoring out perfect squares makes the expression cleaner. I recall that \\(5040\\) can be factored into smaller components.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of \\(5040\\):**\n\n   - Divide by \\(2\\): \\(5040 \\div 2 = 2520\\)\n   - Divide by \\(2\\): \\(2520 \\div 2 = 1260\\)\n   - Divide by \\(2\\): \\(1260 \\div 2 = 630\\)\n   - Divide by \\(2\\): \\(630 \\div 2 = 315\\) *(No longer divisible by \\(2\\))*\n   - Divide by \\(3\\): \\(315 \\div 3 = 105\\)\n   - Divide by \\(3\\): \\(105 \\div 3 = 35\\)\n   - Divide by \\(5\\): \\(35 \\div 5 = 7\\)\n   - Divide by \\(7\\): \\(7 \\div 7 = 1\\)\n\n   So, the prime factors are:\n\n   \\[\n   5040 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Taking Square Root:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{5040} = \\sqrt{(2^2 \\times 3)^2 \\times 5 \\times 7} = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{35} = 12\\sqrt{35}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:** By factoring out perfect squares, \\(\\sqrt{5040}\\) simplifies to \\(12\\sqrt{35}\\). This makes the fraction easier to work with.\n\n## **Step 5: Simplifying the Rationalized Expression**\n\nNow, let's substitute back into our rationalized fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12\\sqrt{35}}{105}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** Simplifying fractions by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD) will make the expression cleaner.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Find GCD of 12 and 105:**\n\n   - Prime factors of \\(12 = 2^2 \\times 3\\)\n   - Prime factors of \\(105 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7\\)\n   - Common factor: \\(3\\)\n\n   So, GCD is \\(3\\).\n\n2. **Divide Numerator and Denominator by 3:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12 \\times \\sqrt{35}}{105} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{35}}{35}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:** The fraction simplifies nicely by dividing both parts by their GCD. This looks clean and is much easier to work with.\n\n## **Step 6: Final Check**\n\nBefore concluding, let's verify if each step aligns correctly:\n\n1. **Rationalization Correctness:** Multiplying the numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt{105}\\) was done correctly.\n\n2. **Simplification Accuracy:** Prime factorization of \\(5040\\) leading to \\(12\\sqrt{35}\\) is correct.\n\n3. **Fraction Simplification:** Dividing by the GCD ensures the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\n**Reflection:** Everything checks out. The steps lead logically from one to the next, and the calculations align.\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\nAfter simplifying and rationalizing the given expression, the final simplified form is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4\\sqrt{35}}{35}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:** By exploring different strategies and checking each step along the way, I've ensured that the solution is accurate. Starting with individual simplifications and then combining them before rationalizing proved efficient. Rationalizing the denominator and simplifying the fraction step-by-step led to a clean and simplified expression.",
