    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, reflecting as I go to ensure I'm on the right track. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work often, and be open to adjusting my approach if something doesn't seem correct.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the problem, the setup involves a larger square with an area of 60, and points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are midpoints of the sides of this square. There's also a smaller square formed by connecting these midpoints.\n\nMy initial reaction is that this probably involves understanding the relationship between the larger square and the smaller square inside it. It reminds me of problems where midpoints are connected to form another geometric shape, like the smaller square inside a larger one.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how to find the area of the smaller square just yet. Maybe I need to think about the properties of squares and how connecting midpoints affects their dimensions.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Coordinate Geometry Approach:** Assign coordinates to the vertices and calculate the areas using distance formulas.\n\n2. **Symmetry and Proportions:** Use the symmetry of squares to determine the relationship between the larger and smaller squares.\n\n3. **Pythagorean Theorem:** Since squares are involved, perhaps right triangles can help relate the sides of the squares.\n\n4. **Midpoint Theorem:** This could be relevant since the points are midpoints, possibly leading to proportional sides.\n\nLet me start with the **Coordinate Geometry Approach** because assigning coordinates seems straightforward for calculating areas. If that doesn't work, I'll explore the other methods.\n\n### **Step 1: Assigning Coordinates**\n\nLet's place the larger square in a coordinate system to make calculations easier.\n\n- Since the area of the larger square is 60, its side length \\(s\\) is:\n  \\[\n  s^2 = 60 \\implies s = \\sqrt{60} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 15} = 2\\sqrt{15}\n  \\]\n\n- I\u2019ll place the square centered at the origin for simplicity. Therefore, the vertices of the larger square are:\n  \\[\n  ( \\pm \\frac{s}{2}, \\pm \\frac{s}{2} ) = \\left( \\pm \\sqrt{15}, \\pm \\sqrt{15} \\right)\n  \\]\n\n- Now, the midpoints \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are:\n  - \\(A\\) on the top side: \\( \\left( 0, \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\right) \\)\n  - \\(B\\) on the right side: \\( \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}, 0 \\right) \\)\n  - \\(C\\) on the bottom side: \\( \\left( 0, -\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\right) \\)\n  - \\(D\\) on the left side: \\( \\left( -\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}, 0 \\right) \\)\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nThis seems like a logical setup. By placing the square at the origin and assigning midpoints, I can easily calculate distances and areas.\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Length of Diagonals of the Smaller Square**\n\nI know that connecting the midpoints forms a smaller square inside the larger square. To find its area, I need to determine the length of its sides or diagonals.\n\nWait a moment\u2014since the smaller square is formed by connecting midpoints, its diagonals align with the sides of the larger square. This is key.\n\nBut let's compute it to be sure. The diagonals of the smaller square will be the distances between opposite midpoints.\n\n- Length of diagonal \\(AC\\) or \\(BD\\):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance between } A \\left( 0, \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\right) \\text{ and } C \\left( 0, -\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\right)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\sqrt{ \\left( 0 - 0 \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} - \\left( -\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\right) \\right)^2 }\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\sqrt{ 0 + \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} \\right)^2 }\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\sqrt{15} \\right)^2 }\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\sqrt{15}\n  \\]\n\nSo, the length of the diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) of the smaller square is \\(\\sqrt{15}\\).\n\n### **Check**\n\nThat makes sense because the smaller square's diagonals should align with the sides of the larger square, and since the larger square's sides are \\(\\sqrt{15}\\), this aligns.\n\n### **Step 3: Relationship Between Diagonal and Side Length**\n\nFor any square, the relationship between the diagonal \\(d\\) and side length \\(a\\) is:\n\\[\nd = a\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nSo, if the diagonal \\(AC\\) of the smaller square is \\(\\sqrt{15}\\), its side length \\(a\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{15} = a\\sqrt{2} \\implies a = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{15}{2} } = \\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{2}\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nWait a sec\u2014I feel like I might have made a mistake here. Let's pause and think. If the diagonal of the smaller square is \\(\\sqrt{15}\\), then dividing by \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) gives the side length. This seems correct because the diagonal of a square relates to its side by this formula.\n\nBut let me verify by checking if this side length makes sense for the area calculation.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Area of the Smaller Square**\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of a square is side length squared:\n\\[\nA = a^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{30}{4} = \\frac{15}{2}\n\\]\n\n### **Check**\n\nOkay, let's check if this makes sense. The larger square has an area of 60, and the smaller square's area is \\(\\frac{15}{2} = 7.5\\).\n\nThis doesn't seem right intuitively. Wait, how can the smaller square's area be so small compared to the larger square's area when it's formed by connecting midpoints?\n\n### **Re-evaluation**\n\nHmm, I might have miscalculated the relationship between the larger and smaller squares. Let me reconsider my approach.\n\nMaybe instead of focusing on the diagonals directly, I should explore another method, like using the property that the midpoints form right triangles with the sides of the larger square.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Using Similar Triangles**\n\nI remember that when midpoints are connected in a square, the smaller square is actually a square rotated by 45 degrees relative to the larger square. This might help in finding the relationship between their areas.\n\n**Key Insight:** The area of the smaller square is a fraction of the larger square based on the proportions defined by connecting midpoints.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Area Using Proportions**\n\nLet\u2019s think about how the areas relate. When midpoints of a square's sides are connected, the smaller square\u2019s area is half the area of the larger square. This is a known geometric result.\n\nTherefore, the area of the smaller square \\(A_{small}\\) is:\n\\[\nA_{small} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Area of larger square} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 = 30\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nThis makes more sense. The smaller square inside a larger square formed by connecting midpoints has an area that is half of the larger square's area.\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Proportional Approach**\n\nLet\u2019s verify this by checking the side lengths.\n\n- If the larger square has an area of 60, its side length \\(s\\) is:\n  \\[\n  s = \\sqrt{60} = 2\\sqrt{15}\n  \\]\n\n- The smaller square is formed by connecting midpoints, so each side of the smaller square is parallel to the diagonals of the larger square.\n\n- The length of each side of the smaller square can be calculated as:\n  \\[\n  a_{small} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{15}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{30}\n  \\]\n\n- Therefore, the area of the smaller square is:\n  \\[\n  A_{small} = (\\sqrt{30})^2 = 30\n  \\]\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nEverything adds up. The smaller square's area is indeed 30, which is half of the larger square's area. This aligns with the geometric properties of squares and confirms that the proportion approach is valid.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying calculations, the area of the smaller square is **30**.\n\n**Final Answer:** \n\\[\n\\boxed{30}\n\\]\n\nThis approach, combining coordinate geometry with proportional reasoning, led to a consistent and logical solution. By being open to re-evaluating and adjusting the strategy, I ensured the accuracy of the final answer.",
