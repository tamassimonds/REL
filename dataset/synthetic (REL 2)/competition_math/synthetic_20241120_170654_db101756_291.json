The area of this rectangle is given as \\(8x - 6\\). We're asked to find the value of \\(x\\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems where we set up an equation for the area of a rectangle. The area is usually the product of its length and width, so I should be able to set up an equation using that.\n  \n- **Different Strategies:** \n  1. **Set Up an Equation:** Multiply the two expressions for length and width and set that equal to the given area.\n  2. **Check for Simplification:** See if the area expression can be simplified or factored, which might give hints about \\(x\\).\n  3. **Graphical Approach:** Although not requested, plotting might give a visual clue, but I think it\u2019s unnecessary here.\n  4. **Alternative Methods:** Perhaps use a quadratic formula if the equation ends up being quadratic.\n\nAt this point, setting up an equation seems like the most straightforward approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf the area of the rectangle is \\( 8x - 6 \\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} = \\text{Area}\n\\]\n\nSo, \n\n\\[\n(x - 2)(2x + 5) = 8x - 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because multiplying the expressions for length and width should give us the area. Let's proceed to expand the left side.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expanding the Left Side**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's expand \\( (x - 2)(2x + 5) \\):\n\n\\[\nx \\times 2x = 2x^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx \\times 5 = 5x\n\\]\n\\[\n-2 \\times 2x = -4x\n\\]\n\\[\n-2 \\times 5 = -10\n\\]\n\nNow, combine these:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 + 5x - 4x - 10 = 2x^2 + x - 10\n\\]\n\nSo, \n\n\\[\n(x - 2)(2x + 5) = 2x^2 + x - 10\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Wait, does this look correct? Yes, multiplying each term seems right. Let's move on.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting the Equation Equal to the Given Area**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, set the expanded expression equal to the given area:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 + x - 10 = 8x - 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe equation looks good. Next, I need to bring all terms to one side to set it to zero. This will help in solving for \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Rearranging the Equation**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubtract \\(8x\\) and add \\(6\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 + x - 10 - 8x + 6 = 0\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 + (1x - 8x) + (-10 + 6) = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2x^2 - 7x - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:** That looks right. All terms have been moved to one side, and the equation is now set to zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to solve the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 - 7x - 4 = 0\\). \n\n**Strategies:**\n\n1. **Factoring:** See if the quadratic can be factored easily.\n2. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the quadratic formula if factoring seems difficult.\n3. **Completing the Square:** Another method, but usually less straightforward for non-monic quadratics.\n\nGiven the coefficients, factoring might be tricky, so let's try the quadratic formula first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Applying the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Formula:**\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\n**Identification:**\n\nFrom \\(2x^2 - 7x - 4 = 0\\):\n\n- \\(a = 2\\)\n- \\(b = -7\\)\n- \\(c = -4\\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Calculate \\(b^2 - 4ac\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   (-7)^2 - 4 \\times 2 \\times (-4) = 49 + 32 = 81\n   \\]\n\n2. **Take the square root:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{81} = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Plug into the formula:**\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{7 \\pm 9}{4}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the two possible values of \\(x\\):**\n\n   - **First solution:**\n     \n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{7 + 9}{4} = \\frac{16}{4} = 4\n     \\]\n\n   - **Second solution:**\n     \n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{7 - 9}{4} = \\frac{-2}{4} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n     \\]\n\n**Check:** Wait, I have two possible solutions, \\(x = 4\\) and \\(x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\). Should both be valid? Generally, in geometry problems like this, negative dimensions don't make sense, so \\(x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\) might be extraneous. But let's verify which one fits the original problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying the Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, it's essential to check which of the solutions makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\n**Testing \\(x = 4\\):**\n\n1. **Calculate dimensions:**\n\n   - Length: \\(4 - 2 = 2\\)\n   - Width: \\(2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13\\)\n\n2. **Calculate area:**\n\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 13 = 26\n   \\]\n\n3. **Given area:**\n\n   \\[\n   8(4) - 6 = 32 - 6 = 26\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Both calculated and given areas match. So, \\(x = 4\\) is a valid solution.\n\n**Testing \\(x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\):**\n\n1. **Calculate dimensions:**\n\n   - Length: \\(-\\frac{1}{2} - 2 = -\\frac{5}{2}\\)\n   - Width: \\(2(-\\frac{1}{2}) + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Calculate area:**\n\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{5}{2} \\times 4 = -10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Given area:**\n\n   \\[\n   8(-\\frac{1}{2}) - 6 = -4 - 6 = -10\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:** While the areas match, having a negative length doesn't make sense in a real-world context. Thus, \\(x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\) is likely extraneous.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:**\n\nBased on the verification, the only sensible solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check:**\n\n**Does this approach make sense?**\n\n- **Setting up the equation:** Correct, as area equals length times width.\n- **Expanding correctly:** Yes, multiplication was done step by step.\n- **Solving the quadratic:** Applied the quadratic formula accurately.\n- **Verifying solutions:** Ensured that only the positive, contextually relevant solution was accepted.\n\n**Does the answer align with the problem's requirements?**\n\nYes, the value of \\(x\\) is 4, which leads to positive dimensions for the rectangle and matches the given area.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Starting with setting up an equation was effective.\n- **Strategy Shift:** Initially considered factoring, but the quadratic formula proved more straightforward.\n- **Mistake Check:** No significant errors were encountered; negative dimensions prompted re-evaluation of the extraneous solution.\n- **Human-like Thinking:** Regular checks ensured the approach was on track, and testing each solution maintained the integrity of the answer.\n\nOverall, approaching the problem methodically, reflecting at each step, and verifying solutions led to identifying \\(x = 4\\) as the correct answer.\n\n---\n\nAll done! By brainstorming different strategies, checking each step, and reflecting on the appropriateness of solutions, I was able to navigate through the problem effectively.",
