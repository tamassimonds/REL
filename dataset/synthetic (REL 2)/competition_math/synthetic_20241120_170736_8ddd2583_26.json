    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together, thinking through it step-by-step as a human would. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and make sure to check my work frequently. If something doesn't seem right, I'll pivot my approach. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst off, let's make sure I fully understand what's being asked:\n\n- **Given Functions:** \n  - \\( f(x) = 2x - 3 \\)\n  - \\( g(x) = x + 1 \\)\n\n- **Task:** \n  - Find the value of \\( f(1 + g(2)) \\)\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nWhen I see this, it reminds me of composition of functions, where you need to evaluate one function inside another. But, wait, before jumping in, let's think about the order of operations. I need to evaluate \\( g(2) \\) first and then use that result in \\( f(x) \\).\n\nHmm, so the inner function \\( g \\) must be computed first, and its output will be used as part of the input for \\( f \\). This is a classic nested function problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Brainstorming Different Approaches:**\n\n1. **Evaluate \\( g(2) \\) First:**  \n   - Since \\( g \\) is inside \\( f \\), I need to start by finding \\( g(2) \\).\n\n2. **Substitute \\( g(2) \\) into \\( f \\):**  \n   - Once I have \\( g(2) \\), I'll substitute that value into \\( f(x) \\).\n\n3. **Check Each Step:**  \n   - After each calculation, I'll check if the numbers make sense to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Wait a second...**  \nIs there any other way to approach this? I could think about rewriting \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) as compositions or perhaps look for simplifications, but given their linear nature, that might complicate things unnecessarily. Sticking to evaluating step-by-step seems straightforward and foolproof.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI feel confident starting with evaluating \\( g(2) \\). If things look off later, I can reassess, but for now, let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluate \\( g(2) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAlright, let's tackle \\( g(2) \\) first. According to the definition of \\( g(x) \\):\n\n\\[ g(x) = x + 1 \\]\n\nSo, substituting \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n\\[\ng(2) = 2 + 1\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\ng(2) = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes that make sense? Adding 1 to 2 seems straightforward. Yup, \\( g(2) = 3 \\) is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, I've successfully found \\( g(2) \\). Next, I'll use this result to find \\( f(3) \\) since \\( f(x) \\) requires the output of \\( g(2) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substitute \\( g(2) \\) into \\( f \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to find \\( f(1 + g(2)) \\). Since we know \\( g(2) = 3 \\), this becomes \\( f(1 + 3) \\), or \\( f(4) \\).\n\nBut before jumping in, let me verify:  \n- **User Query:** \\( f(1 + g(2)) \\)  \n- **Found \\( g(2) \\):** 3  \n- **Therefore:** \\( f(1 + 3) = f(4) \\)\n\nThat aligns with the problem's requirements. Let's proceed.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nf(4) = 2(4) - 3\n\\]\n\\[\n= 8 - 3\n\\]\n\\[\n= 5\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nMultiplying 4 by 2 gives 8, and subtracting 3 results in 5. This seems correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe calculation checks out. \\( f(4) = 5 \\) is the expected output. But let's double-check if I've followed the steps correctly and if the logic flows make sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, I want to ensure that each step logically follows the previous one. Did I correctly evaluate \\( g(2) \\) and then apply that result to \\( f(x) \\)?\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n1. **Computed \\( g(2) \\):**  \n   - \\( g(2) = 3 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. **Substituted into \\( f \\):**  \n   - \\( f(4) = 5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Wait, maybe there's another layer I might have missed...**  \nOh, but looking back, the original expression was \\( f(1 + g(2)) \\). I initially thought of it as \\( f(4) \\), which is correct since \\( g(2) = 3 \\). However, reflecting on the user query, it's crucial to maintain the integrity of the expression throughout the calculation.\n\n**Reassurance:**  \nBy breaking it down step-by-step\u2014first finding \\( g(2) \\) and then evaluating \\( f \\) with that result\u2014I ensured that the process was transparent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nAfter carefully walking through each step:\n- Evaluated \\( g(2) \\) correctly.\n- Substituted the result into \\( f(x) \\) appropriately.\n- Double-checked calculations for accuracy.\n\nThe value of \\( f(1 + g(2)) \\) is indeed **5**.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBy methodically approaching the problem\u2014brainstorming strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying calculations\u2014I confirmed that the solution is correct. This step-by-step walkthrough ensures that even if initial thoughts lead to dead ends, re-evaluating and checking along the way leads to the right answer.\n\n---\n\nI hope this approach mirrors human-like thinking, complete with brainstorming, reflection, and natural checks, making the problem-solving process clear and relatable.
