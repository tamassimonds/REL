    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The question asks how many terms in the expansion of \\((m+n)^6\\) are odd, given that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are odd integers. \n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst, I want to make sure I really grasp what's being asked. The expansion at hand is \\((m+n)^6\\), which reminds me of the Binomial Theorem. That theorem tells us how to expand expressions like this into a sum involving terms with coefficients, powers of \\(m\\), and powers of \\(n\\).\n\nBut here's the twist: we're specifically interested in **odd** terms in this expansion. This makes me think about properties of odd and even numbers, particularly how coefficients and exponents can affect the parity (odd or even) of each term.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Binomial Theorem Approach:** \n   - Use the Binomial Theorem to write out the expansion.\n   - Identify which terms have odd coefficients.\n\n2. **Parity of Coefficients:**\n   - Explore how the coefficients (binomial coefficients) behave when \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are odd.\n   - Maybe leverage Pascal's Triangle or properties of binomial coefficients modulo 2.\n\n3. **Modular Arithmetic Insight:**\n   - Think about evaluating the expansion modulo 2 to simplify the problem.\n\nReflection: The Binomial Theorem approach seems straightforward, but listing all terms might be tedious. Perhaps I can combine this with the parity idea to narrow down odd terms more efficiently.\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Binomial Theorem**\n\nOkay, let\u2019s start with the Binomial Theorem:\n\n\\[\n(m+n)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k\n\\]\n\nHere, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k\\). So, to find odd terms, I need to identify \\(k\\) values where \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) is odd.\n\n### **Thought Process: Checking Binomial Coefficients**\n\nLet\u2019s recall that binomial coefficients \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) can be odd or even. A quick check shows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\binom{6}{0} &= 1 \\quad (\\text{odd}) \\\\\n\\binom{6}{1} &= 6 \\quad (\\text{even}) \\\\\n\\binom{6}{2} &= 15 \\quad (\\text{odd}) \\\\\n\\binom{6}{3} &= 20 \\quad (\\text{even}) \\\\\n\\binom{6}{4} &= 15 \\quad (\\text{odd}) \\\\\n\\binom{6}{5} &= 6 \\quad (\\text{even}) \\\\\n\\binom{6}{6} &= 1 \\quad (\\text{odd}) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSo, the odd coefficients are \\(\\binom{6}{0}\\), \\(\\binom{6}{2}\\), \\(\\binom{6}{4}\\), and \\(\\binom{6}{6}\\).\n\nReflection: There are four odd coefficients. But wait, I should also consider whether the terms themselves remain odd. Since both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are odd integers, their powers will contribute to the overall parity of each term.\n\n### **Step 3: Considering the Powers of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\)**\n\nGiven that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are odd, any odd power of an odd number is odd. Therefore:\n\n- \\(m^{6-k}\\) is odd because \\(m\\) is odd and \\(6-k\\) is non-negative.\n- \\(n^k\\) is odd for the same reason.\n\nThis implies that the parity of each term \\(\\binom{6}{k} m^{6-k} n^k\\) is determined solely by \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\), as both \\(m^{6-k}\\) and \\(n^k\\) are odd (and do not affect the overall parity).\n\n### **Step 4: Finalizing the Count of Odd Terms**\n\nFrom the earlier listing, the odd binomial coefficients are associated with \\(k = 0\\), \\(2\\), \\(4\\), and \\(6\\). So, there are four terms where \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) is odd.\n\nEach of these terms looks like this:\n\n- For \\(k=0\\): \\(\\binom{6}{0} m^6 n^0 = 1 \\cdot m^6\\)\n- For \\(k=2\\): \\(\\binom{6}{2} m^4 n^2 = 15 \\cdot m^4 n^2\\)\n- For \\(k=4\\): \\(\\binom{6}{4} m^2 n^4 = 15 \\cdot m^2 n^4\\)\n- For \\(k=6\\): \\(\\binom{6}{6} m^0 n^6 = 1 \\cdot n^6\\)\n\nReflection: All these terms have odd coefficients and involve odd powers of odd integers, making them odd.\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\nLet me quickly check if this makes sense. We've identified four \\(k\\) values where the coefficients are odd. We've also confirmed that \\(m^{6-k}\\) and \\(n^k\\) are odd for all \\(k\\). Therefore, it seems correct that there are **four odd terms** in the expansion.\n\nWait, does the question ask for the number of odd terms or the number of terms with odd coefficients? Initially, I assumed it meant terms where the entire expression is odd. But based on the context, it likely refers to terms with odd coefficients since both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are odd.\n\nReflection: Yes, the question is about terms in the expansion, so it's reasonable to focus on coefficients being odd.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying each step, the final count is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\nThere are **four terms** in the expansion of \\((m+n)^6\\) that have **odd coefficients**, and since \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are odd integers, these terms themselves are odd.",
