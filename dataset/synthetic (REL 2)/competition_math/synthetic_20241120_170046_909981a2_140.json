    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed, just like a human would when tackling a challenging question.\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nWhen I first see the problem, I'm trying to figure out the largest possible distance between two points\u2014one on each of two spheres. The spheres have different radii and are centered at different coordinates. \n\n**What Comes to Mind:**\nThis reminds me of geometry, specifically dealing with distances in three-dimensional space. I recall that the distance between the centers of the spheres plays a crucial role here. Adding or subtracting the radii could help determine the closest or farthest points on the spheres.\n\n**Initial Strategy:**\n1. **Calculate the Distance Between the Centers:** This gives a baseline to work with.\n2. **Consider the Radii:** Depending on whether I'm looking for the closest or farthest points, I might add or subtract the radii from this distance.\n3. **Check for Overlapping Spheres:** If the spheres intersect, the approach might need adjustment.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Distance Between the Centers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nOkay, let's start by finding the distance between the centers of the two spheres. This seems like a logical starting point because it aligns with how we approach distance in three-dimensional space.\n\n**Calculation:**\nThe centers are given as:\n- Sphere 1: \\((-2, -10, 5)\\)\n- Sphere 2: \\((12, 8, -16)\\)\n\nWe can use the distance formula:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2 }\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the coordinates:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(12 - (-2))^2 + (8 - (-10))^2 + (-16 - 5)^2 }\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{(12 + 2)^2 + (8 + 10)^2 + (-16 - 5)^2 }\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{(14)^2 + (18)^2 + (-21)^2 }\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{196 + 324 + 441 }\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{961 }\n\\]\n\\[\n= 31\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, the distance between the centers is **31**. That seems reasonable, but now I need to consider how the radii come into play to find the largest possible distance between points on the spheres.\n\n### **Step 2: Considering the Radii**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I have the distance between the centers, I need to incorporate the radii of both spheres to determine the largest possible distance between points on their surfaces.\n\n**Possible Approaches:**\n1. **Adding the Radii:** This would make sense if I'm looking for the farthest distance between points on the surfaces.\n2. **Subtracting the Radii:** This could apply if I'm considering the closest points, but since the question asks for the largest distance, I think adding the radii is correct here.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Radius of Sphere 1: **19**\n- Radius of Sphere 2: **87**\n\nAdding the radii to the distance between the centers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Largest Distance} = d + r_1 + r_2 = 31 + 19 + 87 = 137\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\nHmm, **137** seems like a large number. I need to make sure this approach is correct. Adding the radii intuitively makes sense because we're considering points on the outermost parts of each sphere.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nAt this point, I want to ensure that adding the radii to the center-to-center distance is indeed the correct method for finding the largest possible distance between points on the spheres.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- The distance between the centers is **31**.\n- Adding the radii **(19 + 87 = 106)** makes sense because it represents the additional reach of each sphere beyond its center.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\nIs there another way to approach this? For example, I could visualize it as extending a line from the center of one sphere through its radius to the center of the other sphere and adding that line's extension based on the second sphere's radius.\n\nBut adding the radii to the center-to-center distance directly aligns with finding the maximum distance, so I think we're on the right track.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe math checks out, and the logic feels sound. However, let me briefly consider if the spheres could overlap or if there's another complication, but since we're only asked for the largest distance, overlapping doesn't affect this calculation.\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\nBased on the steps above:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Largest Possible Distance} = 31 + 19 + 87 = 137\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe largest possible distance between two points\u2014one on each sphere\u2014is **137** units.\n\n**Final Check:**\nThis result makes sense given the structure of the problem. Adding the radii to the center-to-center distance accounts for the furthest possible separation between points on the two spheres.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nOverall, starting with the distance between the centers and then incorporating the radii was the right approach. Initially, I considered both adding and subtracting the radii but confirmed that adding was correct for finding the largest distance. Reflecting and checking along the way ensured the solution's accuracy.\n\nSo, the largest possible distance between the two points is **137**.",
