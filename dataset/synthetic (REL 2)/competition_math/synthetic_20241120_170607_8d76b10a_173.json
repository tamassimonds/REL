    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking just like a human would\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and maybe even changing our approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The question gives me \\(8^{-1} \\equiv 85 \\pmod{97}\\). This tells me that 85 is the multiplicative inverse of 8 modulo 97. \n- I need to find \\(64^{-1} \\pmod{97}\\). So, I\u2019m looking for an integer between 0 and 96 that, when multiplied by 64, gives a result congruent to 1 modulo 97.\n- Wait, 64 is \\(8^2\\), so maybe there's a relationship there. That\u2019s a small lightbulb moment\u2014perhaps knowing \\(8^{-1}\\) can help me find \\(64^{-1}\\).\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Given Inverse:**\n   - Since \\(64 = 8^2\\), maybe I can leverage \\(8^{-1} \\equiv 85\\) to find \\(64^{-1}\\).\n   \n2. **Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - If the first method is tricky, I could use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the inverse directly.\n\n3. **Check with Modular Properties:**\n   - Perhaps applying properties of modular arithmetic could simplify the process.\n\n**Exploring the First Strategy:**\n\nSo, let's try to use the given \\(8^{-1} \\equiv 85\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Given Inverse**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If \\(8 \\times 85 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{97}\\), maybe multiplying both sides of the equation by 8 could help us find something useful for \\(64^{-1} = (8^2)^{-1}\\).\n- But wait, multiplying by 8 here might not directly lead me to \\(64^{-1}\\). Perhaps I need a different approach.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This doesn't seem straightforward. Multiplying both sides wouldn't directly give me \\(64^{-1}\\). Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- Since this path isn\u2019t leading anywhere clear, I'll abandon it and try another strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Consider the Relationship Between \\(8^{-1}\\) and \\(64^{-1}\\)**\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n- I recalled that \\(64 = 8^2\\). In modular arithmetic, the inverse of a square is often related to the inverse of the base. \n- Specifically, \\((a^2)^{-1} \\equiv (a^{-1})^2 \\pmod{m}\\). So, \\(64^{-1} \\equiv (8^{-1})^2 \\pmod{97}\\).\n\n**Thinking:**\n\n- This looks promising because it directly relates \\(64^{-1}\\) to \\(8^{-1}\\), which I already know.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Given \\(8^{-1} \\equiv 85 \\pmod{97}\\), then:\n  \n  \\[\n  (8^{-1})^2 \\equiv 85^2 \\pmod{97}\n  \\]\n\n**Now, let's compute \\(85^2 \\mod 97\\):**\n\n\\[\n85^2 = 7225\n\\]\n\n\\[\n7225 \\div 97 = 74 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 7225 - (74 \\times 97) = 7225 - 7178 = 47\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n85^2 \\equiv 47 \\pmod{97}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This seems logical. If \\(8^{-1} \\equiv 85\\), then squaring both sides should give me the inverse of \\(8^2 = 64\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does \\(47 \\times 64 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{97}\\)? Let's verify.\n\n\\[\n64 \\times 47 = 3008\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3008 \\div 97 = 30 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 3008 - (30 \\times 97) = 3008 - 2910 = 98\n\\]\n\n\\[\n98 \\pmod{97} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Yes, \\(64 \\times 47 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{97}\\). This confirms that our approach is correct.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 3:**\n\n- \\(64^{-1} \\equiv 47 \\pmod{97}\\). This matches the requirement of being between 0 and 96.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Cross-Verification Using Extended Euclidean Algorithm**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To ensure the correctness, I can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find \\(64^{-1} \\pmod{97}\\) independently.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1. **Express 64 in terms of 97:**\n\n   \\[\n   97 = 64 \\times 1 + 33\n   \\]\n\n2. **Express 64 in terms of 33:**\n\n   \\[\n   64 = 33 \\times 1 + 31\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express 33 in terms of 31:**\n\n   \\[\n   33 = 31 \\times 1 + 2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Express 31 in terms of 2:**\n\n   \\[\n   31 = 2 \\times 15 + 1\n   \\]\n\n5. **Express 2 in terms of 1:**\n\n   \\[\n   2 = 1 \\times 2 + 0\n   \\]\n\n**Back Substitution to Find Inverse:**\n\n\\[\n1 = 31 - 2 \\times 15\n\\]\n\\[\n2 = 33 - 31 \\times 1\n\\]\n\\[\n1 = 31 - (33 - 31 \\times 1) \\times 15 = 31 \\times 16 - 33 \\times 15\n\\]\n\\[\n31 = 64 - 33 \\times 1 \\Rightarrow 1 = (64 - 33 \\times 1) \\times 16 - 33 \\times 15 = 64 \\times 16 - 33 \\times 31\n\\]\n\\[\n33 = 97 - 64 \\times 1 \\Rightarrow 1 = 64 \\times 16 - (97 - 64 \\times 1) \\times 31 = 64 \\times 47 - 97 \\times 31\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n- This equation shows that \\(64 \\times 47 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{97}\\), confirming our earlier result.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The extended Euclidean algorithm yields the same result, which adds confidence to the correctness of our initial approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- By recognizing the relationship between \\(64\\) and \\(8\\), we were able to link \\(64^{-1}\\) to \\(8^{-1}\\), simplifying the problem.\n- Cross-verifying with the extended Euclidean algorithm ensured that our solution was correct and consistent.\n- Throughout the process, reflecting on each step and checking the work helped catch any potential mistakes early.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n64^{-1} \\equiv 47 \\pmod{97}\n\\]\n\nSo, the residue modulo 97 is **47**.",
