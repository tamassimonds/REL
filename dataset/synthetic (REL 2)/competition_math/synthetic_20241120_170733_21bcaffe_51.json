    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking if my approach is correct, and making adjustments as needed\u2014just like I would when tackling a problem naturally.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nWhen I first see the question, my mind recalls that fractions can often be converted into decimals. The problem states that the repeating decimal for \\( \\frac{3}{11} \\) is \\( 0.ababab\\ldots \\). I need to find the sum \\( a + b \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Conversion to Decimal:** Maybe I should convert \\( \\frac{3}{11} \\) into its decimal form to identify \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n- **Properties of Repeating Decimals:** Alternatively, I recall that repeating decimals have specific patterns based on the fraction.\n- **Lunar Pattern Approach:** There's also the familiar lunar pattern in repeating decimals that I could explore.\n\n**Reflecting:**\nConverting fractions to decimals is straightforward and seems like a reliable starting point. But if that gets messy, I can consider other methods like analyzing repeating patterns.\n\n**Decision:**\nLet me begin by converting \\( \\frac{3}{11} \\) to a decimal. If this leads me to the solution, I'll proceed; if not, I'll explore other strategies.\n\n### **Step 2: Converting \\( \\frac{3}{11} \\) to a Decimal**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo convert a fraction into a decimal, I can perform long division. I'll divide 3 by 11 to find its decimal representation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Long Division Setup:** \n  - \\( 3.0000 \\div 11 \\)\n  - 11 goes into 30 two times: \\( 11 \\times 2 = 22 \\)\n  - Subtract: \\( 30 - 22 = 8 \\)\n  - Bring down the next 0: \\( 80 \\)\n  - 11 goes into 80 seven times: \\( 11 \\times 7 = 77 \\)\n  - Subtract: \\( 80 - 77 = 3 \\)\n  - Bring down the next 0: \\( 30 \\)\n  - 11 goes into 30 two times again: \\( 11 \\times 2 = 22 \\)\n  - Subtract: \\( 30 - 22 = 8 \\)\n  - Bring down the next 0: \\( 80 \\)\n  - 11 goes into 80 seven times: \\( 11 \\times 7 = 77 \\)\n  - Subtract: \\( 80 - 77 = 3 \\)\n  - Bring down the next 0: \\( 30 \\)\n\n**Observation:**\nNotice that after a few steps, the remainder repeats: \\( 3 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 3 \\). This indicates that the decimal is repeating.\n\n**Result:**\nSo, \\( \\frac{3}{11} = 0.27\\overline{27} \\), meaning \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\).\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because when I multiply back:\n\\[ \n0.27 \\times 11 = 2.97 \n\\]\nAnd rounding up due to the repeating nature:\n\\[ \n2.97 \\approx 3 \n\\]\nThis aligns with the original fraction, confirming the correctness of the decimal conversion.\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Sum \\( a + b \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I have \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\), I just need to find their sum.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \na + b = 2 + 7 = 9 \n\\]\n\n**Reflecting:**\nDoes this seem reasonable? Adding single digits like this is straightforward, and given that the decimal conversion was correct, the sum should be accurate.\n\n**Check:**\nDouble-checking the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\): \n- \\( a = 2 \\)\n- \\( b = 7 \\)\n\nYes, these align with the repeating decimal \\( 0.27\\overline{27} \\).\n\n### **Step 4: Alternative Approach \u2013 Verifying with Patterns**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\nJust to ensure the correctness, I think about whether there's another way to verify the result without conversion. Perhaps using properties of repeating decimals or patterns.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nRepeating decimals have their digits cycling in a fixed pattern. For a fraction \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\) where \\( q \\) is 11, the repeating part often involves two digits.\n\n**Reflection:**\nGiven that \\( \\frac{3}{11} = 0.\\overline{27} \\), and the pattern involves two digits repeating, it aligns with the expected structure. This adds confidence to the result.\n\n**Decision:**\nWhile the decimal conversion worked perfectly, checking with patterns serves as a validation step, ensuring no steps were missed.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLooking back, converting \\( \\frac{3}{11} \\) to decimal via long division was straightforward and led directly to the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). The repeating nature of the decimal confirmed the correctness.\n\n**Reflection:**\nInitially, I considered multiple strategies\u2014decimal conversion, analyzing repeating patterns, and leveraging known decimal expansions. Starting with the most direct method (decimal conversion) made sense and proved effective.\n\n**Check:**\nThroughout the process, I checked:\n- Correctness of the long division steps\n- Consistency of repeating patterns\n- Validity of the sum \\( a + b \\)\n\nEverything aligns perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe value of the sum \\( a + b \\) is **9**.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Approach:** Converted \\( \\frac{3}{11} \\) to decimal using long division.\n- **Findings:** \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 7 \\), so \\( a + b = 9 \\).\n- **Verification:** Checked decimal conversion accuracy and considered alternative methods for validation.\n- **Final Answer:** \\( a + b = 9 \\).",

Now we can subtract:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&300/11 &=& ab&.ababab\\ldots \\\\\n- &3/11 &=& 0&.ababab\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&297/11 &=& ab &\n\\end{array}$$\n\nWe can simplify $\\frac{297}{11}$ to $27$, giving us the two digits we sought: $a=2$ and $b=7$. Thus, $a+b = 2+7 = \\boxed{9}$.\n\n(Alternatively, we could solve this problem by long division.)"
