    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness often, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see a quadratic equation:  \n\\[ z^2 + (10 + ai)z + (27 + bi) = 0 \\]\n\nThe question states that the roots are **complex conjugates**. My immediate thought is:  \n- **Complex Conjugates:** For a quadratic equation with real coefficients, if the roots are complex, they must be conjugates of each other. This means if \\( z_1 \\) is a root, then \\( z_2 = \\overline{z_1} \\).\n\nBut here, the coefficients themselves involve complex numbers (\\( ai \\) and \\( bi \\)), which is a bit unusual. Typically, we expect the coefficients to be real for the roots to be complex conjugates. Hmm, this makes me suspect that perhaps the **imaginary parts** of the coefficients need to balance out in a specific way.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Apply the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem:**  \n   Normally, if the coefficients are real, the non-real roots come in conjugate pairs. But here, the coefficients have imaginary parts. Maybe the real parts need to cancel out the imaginary coefficients' effects.\n\n2. **Use Vieta\u2019s Formulas:**  \n   These relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Perhaps setting up equations based on Vieta\u2019s could help find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n3. **Discriminant Analysis:**  \n   The discriminant of a quadratic determines the nature of the roots. For complex roots, the discriminant should be negative. But with complex coefficients, perhaps there's a different condition that applies.\n\n4. **Set Up Equations from Complex Conjugate Condition:**  \n   Since the roots are complex conjugates, maybe I can set up an equation where one root is the conjugate of the other and see how that constrains \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nI'm leaning towards the **Complex Conjugate Root Theorem** combined with **Vieta\u2019s Formulas**, but I'm not entirely sure if that will be sufficient. Let's start with this and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Complex Conjugate Root Theorem**\n\nIf the roots are complex conjugates, and given that the coefficients involve imaginary parts, maybe the imaginary parts of the coefficients need to balance out.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- For a quadratic to have complex conjugate roots, the coefficient \\( z \\) must have properties such that the imaginary parts don't skew the roots away from being conjugates.\n- This seems abstract, but perhaps the imaginary parts of the constant term and the linear coefficient must satisfy some condition.\n\n**Exploring Strategy:**  \n- Let's consider that if the roots are \\( z_1 \\) and \\( z_2 = \\overline{z_1} \\), then their sum \\( z_1 + z_2 \\) should be real. This is because for complex conjugates, the imaginary parts cancel out.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- According to Vieta\u2019s, the sum of the roots \\( z_1 + z_2 \\) is equal to the negative of the coefficient of \\( z \\), which is \\( -(10 + ai) \\).\n- So, \\( z_1 + \\overline{z_1} = 2\\operatorname{Re}(z_1) = - (10 + ai) \\).\n  \n  This implies that the imaginary part must be zero for the sum to be real.\n\nBut wait\u2014this suggests that \\( a \\) must be zero, which would simplify the problem significantly. Let's see if this holds true.\n\n**Checking This Approach:**\n- If \\( a = 0 \\), the linear coefficient becomes \\( 10 \\), which is real. This aligns with the property that the sum of the roots must be real.\n- Now, the constant term is \\( 27 + bi \\). For the roots to be conjugates, perhaps \\( b \\) also needs to be zero.\n\nDoes this make sense? Let's proceed with \\( a = 0 \\) and see if \\( b \\) can also be determined.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting \\( a = 0 \\) and Analyzing \\( b \\)**\n\nWith \\( a = 0 \\), the equation simplifies to:  \n\\[ z^2 + 10z + (27 + bi) = 0 \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Now, the only complex part left is \\( bi \\). For the roots to be complex conjugates, the coefficient of \\( z^2 \\) must be real, which it is. The constant term can still have an imaginary part, but perhaps it needs to be balanced by \\( b \\).\n\n**Exploring Further:**  \n- Let\u2019s consider the product of the roots. According to Vieta\u2019s, the product \\( z_1 z_2 = 27 + bi \\).\n- Since \\( z_2 = \\overline{z_1} \\), their product \\( z_1 z_2 = |z_1|^2 \\), which is always real and non-negative.\n- But the constant term \\( 27 + bi \\) is complex. For the product \\( z_1 z_2 \\) to be real, perhaps the imaginary part \\( bi \\) must be zero.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- If \\( bi = 0 \\), then \\( b = 0 \\).\n- This would mean the constant term is \\( 27 \\), making the entire quadratic have real coefficients.\n\n**Immediate Check:**\n- If both \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\), the equation becomes:  \n  \\[ z^2 + 10z + 27 = 0 \\]  \n  which is a standard quadratic with real coefficients.\n\n- Does this satisfy the original condition that the roots are complex conjugates?  \n  **Wait a minute:** If both coefficients are real, the roots could be real as well. But the problem states the roots are complex conjugates, so this seems off.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Ah, I realize now that having both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as zero would make the entire quadratic real, potentially leading to real roots, which contradicts the given condition of complex conjugates.\n  \n- **Mistake Identified:** My initial approach led me to simplify too much, ignoring the possibility that the quadratic could still have complex conjugate roots even with complex coefficients.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Reassessing the Strategy**\n\nGiven that setting \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\) doesn't align with the requirement of having complex conjugate roots, I need to reconsider my approach.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \n- Perhaps instead of assuming \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are zero, I should explore how the imaginary parts of the coefficients contribute to the conditions for the roots to be complex conjugates.\n  \n- Maybe there\u2019s a relationship between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) that ensures the roots are conjugates without eliminating the imaginary parts entirely.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Let\u2019s revisit the condition that the sum of the roots is real and see if it imposes restrictions only on \\( a \\) or \\( b \\), or both.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- The sum of the roots is:  \n  \\[ z_1 + z_2 = -(10 + ai) = -10 - ai \\]  \n  For this to be real, the imaginary part must be zero, implying \\( a = 0 \\).\n\n- The product of the roots is:  \n  \\[ z_1 z_2 = 27 + bi \\]  \n  Since \\( z_1 z_2 = |z_1|^2 \\), which is real, the imaginary part \\( bi \\) must also be zero, implying \\( b = 0 \\).\n\n**Final Check:**\n- If \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\), the quadratic becomes:  \n  \\[ z^2 + 10z + 27 = 0 \\]  \n  This is a real quadratic. While the roots could be complex, the condition that the roots are complex conjugates is still satisfied because the coefficients have no imaginary parts left to interfere.\n\n**Realization:**\n- **Aha Moment:** Even though initially it seemed that having \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as zero would lead to real roots, upon deeper reflection, it's the absence of imaginary parts in the coefficients that ensures the roots are conjugates when they are complex.\n\n- So, the ordered pair \\( (a, b) \\) that satisfies the condition is \\( (0, 0) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Verification**\n\nBefore concluding, let\u2019s ensure that setting \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\) indeed aligns with all the problem's requirements.\n\n**Verification:**\n- **Sum of Roots:**  \n  \\[ z_1 + z_2 = -10 \\]  \n  This is real, satisfying the condition for complex conjugates.\n\n- **Product of Roots:**  \n  \\[ z_1 z_2 = 27 \\]  \n  This is also real.\n\n- **Nature of Roots:**  \n  Since the quadratic has real coefficients (after setting \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to zero), the roots are either real or complex conjugates. However, because the original problem specifies that the roots are complex conjugates, it\u2019s implicit that the quadratic must have complex roots, which it does.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The ordered pair \\( (a, b) = (0, 0) \\) satisfies all the given conditions.\n\n**Final Thought:**  \n- Initially, setting \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to zero seemed too simplistic, but upon re-examining the requirements for complex conjugate roots, it became clear that eliminating the imaginary parts from the coefficients aligns perfectly with the condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring various strategies, reflecting on their validity, and verifying the conditions, the ordered pair is:  \n\\[ \\boxed{(0, 0)} \\]  \n\nThis indicates that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) both must be zero for the roots of the given quadratic equation to be complex conjugates.\n\n---",
