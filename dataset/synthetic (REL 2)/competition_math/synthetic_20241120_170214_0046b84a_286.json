    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, emulating how a human would naturally think through it, complete with brainstorming, reflections, and checks along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n---\n\n*A jar is filled with red, orange, and yellow jelly beans. The probability of randomly selecting a red jelly bean is \\(0.2\\), and the probability of randomly selecting an orange jelly bean is \\(0.5\\). What is the probability of randomly selecting a yellow jelly bean?*\n\n---\n\nImmediately, I notice:\n\n- **Three Colors:** Red, orange, and yellow jelly beans.\n- **Given Probabilities:** Red = \\(0.2\\), Orange = \\(0.5\\).\n- **Objective:** Find the probability of selecting a yellow jelly bean.\n\n---\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Total Probability Must Sum to 1:** I recall that in probability, the total probability of all possible outcomes must equal \\(1\\). This seems like a straightforward approach.\n  \n- **Check for Missing Information:** Wait, I don't see any probabilities summing to \\(1\\) yet because red and orange do not add up to \\(1\\). So, there must be a positive probability for yellow.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Use the Total Probability Rule:** Since the total must be \\(1\\), subtract the sum of the given probabilities from \\(1\\).\n  2. **Verify Independent Events:** Check if the probabilities behave independently. (But since all selections are from the same jar, they should sum up irrespective of independence.)\n  \n- **Reflection:** The first strategy seems direct\u2014just calculate what's left for yellow. The second isn't necessary because all colors are accounted for in a single event.\n\n- **Feelings:** This approach feels right because the total probability rule is a fundamental principle. But let me keep an eye out for any potential missteps as I proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Sum of Given Probabilities**\n\nLet's start by adding up the probabilities of red and orange:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Red}) + P(\\text{Orange}) = 0.2 + 0.5 = 0.7\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- The sum of red and orange is \\(0.7\\).\n- According to the total probability rule, the probabilities must add up to \\(1\\). So, yellow should take up the remaining probability.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- *Does this make sense?* Yes, because \\(0.7\\) out of \\(1\\) is already assigned to red and orange, leaving \\(0.3\\) for yellow.\n  \n- *Quick Check:* \\(0.2 + 0.5 + 0.3 = 1.0\\). Perfect!\n\n**Flowing Thought:** Alright, that checks out. The probability for yellow should be \\(0.3\\). But let me verify this with another method to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verify Using Total Probability Rule**\n\nTo double-check, let's consider the total probability must equal \\(1\\):\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Total}) = P(\\text{Red}) + P(\\text{Orange}) + P(\\text{Yellow}) = 1\n\\]\n\nWe already know:\n\n\\[\n0.2 + 0.5 + P(\\text{Yellow}) = 1\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n0.7 + P(\\text{Yellow}) = 1\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\(0.7\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Yellow}) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- This confirms our earlier calculation. The probability of selecting a yellow jelly bean is indeed \\(0.3\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- *Is there another way to verify this?* We could think about proportions or even simulate a small sample. But for simplicity, the total probability rule suffices here.\n\n- *Feeling Confident?* Yes, two methods aligning gives me confidence in the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Consider Alternative Approach\u2014Proportions**\n\nThinking about it, another way to approach this could be considering proportions of each color.\n\nBut wait...\n\n---\n\n**Dead End:**\n\n- *Does this seem necessary?* Proportions might complicate things since probabilities are already given. The total probability method is more straightforward.\n\n- *Reflection:* Perhaps trying to overcomplicate it isn't needed. Sticking with the total probability rule is cleaner.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check Before Concluding**\n\nBefore wrapping up, let's do a final check:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Red}) + P(\\text{Orange}) + P(\\text{Yellow}) = 0.2 + 0.5 + 0.3 = 1.0\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- Everything sums correctly to \\(1.0\\).\n  \n- *Is there anything missing?* No additional information or exceptions provided in the question.\n\n- *Quick Reflection:* The approach and the answer seem consistent with probability principles.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the calculations through multiple methods, the probability of randomly selecting a yellow jelly bean from the jar is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflections:**\n\n- *Was the initial strategy sufficient?* Yes, the total probability rule provided a clear path.\n  \n- *Did considering alternative methods help?* It reaffirmed the correctness of the initial approach and ensured no steps were missed.\n  \n- *Is there any uncertainty left?* No, all checks align, confirming the probability is accurately determined.\n\nBy thinking through the problem step by step, exploring various strategies, reflecting frequently, and checking work continuously, we've arrived confidently at the probability of \\(0.3\\) for selecting a yellow jelly bean.",

  "ground_truth": "The sum of the probabilities of each of the possibilities must be equal to 1.  This means that the sum of the probability of randomly selecting a red jelly bean, the probability of randomly selecting an orange jelly bean, and the probability of randomly selecting a yellow jelly bean is equal to 1.  If we let the probability of randomly selecting a yellow jelly bean be $x$, then we have \\begin{align*}0.2+0.5+x&=1\\\\\\Rightarrow0.7+x&=1\\\\\\Rightarrow{x}&=1-0.7\\\\\\Rightarrow{x}&=0.3\\end{align*} Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a yellow jelly bean from this jar is $\\boxed{0.3}$."
