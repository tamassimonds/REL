    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: **Expand the product \\((x+2)(x+5)\\)**. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness, and making adjustments as needed\u2014just like how I would tackle it in real life.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see \\((x+2)(x+5)\\), I recognize it as the **product of two binomials**. This reminds me of the **distributive property** I\u2019ve used before or perhaps the **FOIL (First, Outside, Inside, Last)** method, which is a mnemonic specifically for expanding binomials. \n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n- **FOIL Method:** Seems straightforward since it's designed for two-binomial products.\n- **Distributive Property:** Maybe distribute each term in the first binomial across the second.\n- **Vertical Method (Like Column Addition):** This might align with how we add multi-digit numbers vertically\u2014could be useful.\n- **Using Algebra Tiles:** Thinking visually, though it might be overkill for a simple expansion.\n\nHmm... **Wait**, the FOIL method comes to mind first, and it\u2019s quick for a two-binomial product. But let\u2019s explore the other methods briefly to see which feels right.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **FOIL Method:**\n   - **First:** Multiply the first terms of each binomial.\n   - **Outside:** Multiply the outer terms.\n   - **Inside:** Multiply the inner terms.\n   - **Last:** Multiply the last terms.\n\n2. **Distributive Property:**\n   - Distribute each term in \\((x+2)\\) across \\((x+5)\\).\n\n3. **Vertical Method:**\n   - Write it like a column multiplication, aligning like terms.\n\n4. **Using Algebra Tiles:**\n   - Visualize the expansion using tiles to represent each term.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **FOIL** seems neat and organized for this specific case.\n- **Distributive Property** is basic and foundational; perhaps more fundamental.\n- **Vertical Method** could work, but it might get messy for larger problems.\n- **Algebra Tiles** would be helpful for a conceptual understanding, but it's probably overkill here.\n\n**Conclusion:** Given the simplicity of the problem, the **FOIL Method** stands out as the most straightforward. But to ensure robustness, I\u2019ll also consider the **Distributive Property** as a backup.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Approach Using FOIL Method**\n\nLet's start with the **FOIL Method**:\n\n#### **Step 1: Multiply the First Terms**\n\n\\[\n\\text{First: } x \\times x = x^2\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Multiplying the leading coefficients\u2014both are \\(x\\). \\(x \\times x = x^2\\)\u2014makes sense.\n\n#### **Step 2: Multiply the Outside Terms**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Outside: } x \\times 5 = 5x\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Multiplying \\(x\\) (from the first binomial) with \\(5\\) (from the second) gives \\(5x\\)\u2014correct.\n\n#### **Step 3: Multiply the Inside Terms**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inside: } 2 \\times x = 2x\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Multiplying \\(2\\) (from the first binomial) with \\(x\\) (from the second) gives \\(2x\\)\u2014also correct.\n\n#### **Step 4: Multiply the Last Terms**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Last: } 2 \\times 5 = 10\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Multiplying the constants \\(2\\) and \\(5\\) gives \\(10\\)\u2014no issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Combine All the Products**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 5x + 2x + 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** At this stage, I have four terms. **Wait**, can I simplify further? Yes, by combining like terms.\n\n#### **Step 6: Combine Like Terms**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + (5x + 2x) + 10 = x^2 + 7x + 10\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Adding \\(5x\\) and \\(2x\\) gives \\(7x\\)\u2014looks good.\n\n**Final Result Using FOIL:**\n\n\\[\n(x+2)(x+5) = x^2 + 7x + 10\n\\]\n\n**Quick Double Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because expanding each binomial step by step naturally leads to these terms. \n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Distributive Property**\n\nJust to ensure correctness, let\u2019s apply the **Distributive Property** as a backup.\n\n#### **Step 1: Distribute Each Term in \\((x+2)\\) Across \\((x+5)\\)**\n\n- **First Term:**\n  \\[\n  x \\times (x + 5) = x^2 + 5x\n  \\]\n\n- **Second Term:**\n  \\[\n  2 \\times (x + 5) = 2x + 10\n  \\]\n\n#### **Step 2: Combine Both Results**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 5x + 2x + 10 = x^2 + 7x + 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This gives the same result as the FOIL method. **Ahh**, that reassures me that the expansion is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n(x+2)(x+5) = x^2 + 7x + 10\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Both Methods Worked:** FOIL and Distributive Property led to the same correct expansion.\n- **FOIL Was Quicker:** Given the simplicity of the problem, FOIL was more straightforward.\n- **Double-Checking Is Valuable:** Using an alternative method confirmed the accuracy of the result.\n- **Mistakes Are Learning Opportunities:** Initially, I considered more complex methods (like Vertical or Algebra Tiles), but recognizing they were unnecessary helped streamline the process.\n\n**Final Reflection:** Expanding \\((x+2)(x+5)\\) using the FOIL method was effective and efficient. Always considering multiple strategies and double-checking results ensures accuracy and builds confidence in the solution.\n\n---\n\nHope this detailed walk-through helps in understanding how to expand binomials step by step!",
