    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it on my own.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the problem, I notice the equation:  \n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\]  \nand the goal is to find the minimal possible value of \\( |a - b| \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- The equation involves both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) multiplicatively and additively. This reminds me of problems where you can factor or rearrange terms.\n- Given that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers, maybe looking for integer solutions would help.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Factoring the equation** to see if it simplifies.\n  2. **Rearranging terms** to isolate one variable.\n  3. **Substituting values** for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to find possible pairs.\n  4. **Using modular arithmetic** to eliminate impossible solutions.\n  \n**But Wait:**  \nI'm not immediately sure if factoring will work because of the mixed terms \\( -3a \\) and \\( +4b \\). Maybe rearranging or substituting values could be more straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Factoring the Equation**\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nMaybe I can factor the left side to see if it looks like a standard form. But looking at \\( ab - 3a + 4b \\), it doesn't resemble common factorable forms like quadratics or products.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoesn't seem promising. Factoring might not simplify this equation effectively. I think this strategy won't lead me anywhere useful.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLet's move on to another approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Rearranging Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nPerhaps I can rearrange the equation to isolate one variable and see if that leads me closer to finding \\( |a - b| \\).\n\n**Step 1:**  \nStart with the original equation:  \n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\]\n\n**Step 2:**  \nRearrange to group \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) terms together:  \n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b - 137 = 0 \\]  \nor  \n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\]\n\n**Step 3:**  \nCan I factor or complete the square?  \nWait, I see an opportunity to factor by grouping.\n\n**Step 4:**  \nGroup terms involving \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):  \n\\[ a(b - 3) + 4b = 137 \\]  \nThis doesn't immediately help because of the \\( +4b \\) term.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Maybe factoring isn't the right path.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTime to consider another strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Substituting Values**\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nGiven that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, I could try plugging in small integer values to see if they satisfy the equation. This might help identify possible \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) pairs.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis approach might be time-consuming, but it could provide valuable insights or even lead to the solution directly.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nLet's start with small values for \\( b \\) and see if we can find corresponding \\( a \\).\n\n- **Assume \\( b = 1 \\):**  \n\\[ a(1) - 3a + 4(1) = 137 \\]  \n\\[ a - 3a + 4 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ -2a + 4 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ -2a = 137 - 4 \\]  \n\\[ -2a = 133 \\]  \n\\[ a = \\frac{133}{-2} = -66.5 \\]  \n**Wait,** \\( a \\) must be a positive integer, so \\( b = 1 \\) doesn't work.\n\n**Checking:**  \nNegative and non-integer value for \\( a \\) isn't valid. Maybe \\( b = 1 \\) is too small.\n\n**Step 2:**  \nTry \\( b = 2 \\):  \n\\[ a(2) - 3a + 4(2) = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 2a - 3a + 8 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ -a + 8 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ -a = 137 - 8 \\]  \n\\[ -a = 129 \\]  \n\\[ a = -129 \\]  \nAgain, \\( a \\) is negative. **Reflection:** This isn't working.\n\n**Step 3:**  \nMaybe I should try larger \\( b \\) values.\n\n- **Try \\( b = 10 \\):**  \n\\[ a(10) - 3a + 4(10) = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 10a - 3a + 40 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 7a + 40 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 7a = 137 - 40 \\]  \n\\[ 7a = 97 \\]  \n\\[ a = \\frac{97}{7} \\approx 13.857 \\]  \n**Wait,** \\( a \\) isn't an integer. Hmm, maybe I need to try different \\( b \\) values or adjust my approach.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis method is taking too long and isn't yielding integer solutions quickly. Let's pivot.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 4: Using Modular Arithmetic**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nPerhaps using modular arithmetic can help eliminate impossible values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Given that we're looking for integer solutions, this might narrow down the possibilities.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nLook at the equation modulo 3 to simplify.\n\n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\]  \n\\[ ab + 4b \\equiv 137 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\]  \n\\[ ab + 4b \\equiv 137 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\]  \n\\[ ab + b \\equiv 137 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\]  \n\\[ b(a + 1) \\equiv 137 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\]  \n\\[ b(a + 1) \\equiv 137 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\]  \n\\[ b(a + 1) \\equiv 2 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\]  \n**Reflection:**  \nThis tells us that \\( b(a + 1) \\) must be congruent to 2 modulo 3. Since 3 is prime, both \\( b \\) and \\( a + 1 \\) must be either 1 or 2 modulo 3.\n\n**Step 2:**  \nConsider different cases for \\( b \\) modulo 3:\n\n- **Case 1:** \\( b \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\)  \n  Then, \\( a + 1 \\equiv 2 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\), so \\( a \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\).\n  \n- **Case 2:** \\( b \\equiv 2 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\)  \n  Then, \\( a + 1 \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\), so \\( a \\equiv 0 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\).\n  \n**Possible Strategies:**  \nThis constraints \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to specific residues modulo 3. We can use this to narrow down our integer solutions when we try substituting values.\n\n**But Wait:**  \nThis might help eliminate certain \\( b \\) values that don't satisfy the equation. Let's see if combining this with the earlier substitution method can work.\n\n**Ideas:**  \nMaybe after narrowing down \\( b \\) using modular arithmetic, I can substitute back to find corresponding \\( a \\) values.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis seems like a promising direction. Let's proceed with it.\n\n---\n\n### **Combining Strategies: Substitute with Modular Constraints**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that we know \\( b \\) must be either \\( 1 \\) or \\( 2 \\) modulo 3, we can start testing \\( b \\) values that satisfy this condition and see if corresponding \\( a \\) values are integers.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nFrom Strategy 3, let's revisit larger \\( b \\) values to see if they match our modular constraints.\n\n- **Consider \\( b = 11 \\):**  \n\\[ a(11) - 3a + 4(11) = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 11a - 3a + 44 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 8a + 44 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 8a = 137 - 44 \\]  \n\\[ 8a = 93 \\]  \n\\[ a = \\frac{93}{8} \\approx 11.625 \\]  \n**Wait,** \\( a \\) isn't an integer. But \\( b = 11 \\equiv 2 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\), and according to our modular constraints, \\( a \\) should be \\( 0 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\). \\( 93 \\) is divisible by \\( 3 \\), so \\( a = 11.625 \\) doesn't align with \\( a \\equiv 0 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis suggests that either my calculations are off, or \\( b = 11 \\) isn't a valid solution.\n\n**Checking:**  \nLet's double-check the calculations for \\( b = 11 \\):\n\n\\[ 11a - 3a + 44 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 8a + 44 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 8a = 93 \\]  \n\\[ a = \\frac{93}{8} = 11.625 \\]  \n**Hmm,** the arithmetic seems correct. But since \\( a \\) must be an integer and \\( 11.625 \\) isn't, \\( b = 11 \\) isn't a valid solution.\n\n**Data Insight:**  \nThis might indicate that not all \\( b \\) values that satisfy the modular constraints are valid. Maybe \\( b \\) needs to be smaller or a specific multiple.\n\n**Step 2:**  \nLet's try \\( b = 9 \\):  \n\\[ a(9) - 3a + 4(9) = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 9a - 3a + 36 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 6a + 36 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 6a = 101 \\]  \n\\[ a = \\frac{101}{6} \\approx 16.833 \\]  \nAgain, \\( a \\) isn't an integer.\n\n**Idea:**  \nMaybe I need to try larger \\( b \\) values that also satisfy \\( a \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\) or \\( a \\equiv 0 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 3) \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis isn't yielding integer solutions immediately. Perhaps there's a pattern or specific \\( b \\) value that works that I'm missing.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 5: Use a Systematic Approach to Find Integer Solutions**\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nTo ensure I don't miss possible solutions, let's create a systematic table of \\( b \\) values and corresponding \\( a \\) checks, considering the modular constraints.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis way, I can see which \\( b \\) values lead to integer \\( a \\) solutions and also calculate \\( |a - b| \\) to find the minimal difference.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nList \\( b \\) values starting from 1 onwards that are \\( 1 \\) or \\( 2 \\) modulo 3.\n\n**Step 2:**  \nFor each \\( b \\), calculate \\( a \\) using the rearranged equation.\n\n**Step 3:**  \nCheck if \\( a \\) is a positive integer and calculate \\( |a - b| \\).\n\n**Step 4:**  \nLook for the minimal \\( |a - b| \\).\n\n**Table Setup:**  \nLet's set up a table to track this:\n\n| \\( b \\) | Equation Result | \\( a \\) | Valid Solution? | \\( |a - b| \\) |\n|---------|-----------------|---------|------------------|-------------|\n| 1       |                 |         |                  |             |\n| 2       |                 |         |                  |             |\n| 3       |                 |         |                  |             |\n| ...     |                 |         |                  |             |\n| 9       |                 |         |                  |             |\n| 10      |                 |         |                  |             |\n| 11      |                 |         |                  |             |\n| ...     |                 |         |                  |             |\n\n**Step 5:**  \nLet's start filling this out, focusing on \\( b \\) values that satisfy the modular constraints.\n\n**Start with \\( b = 1 \\):**\n\n- **\\( b = 1 \\):**  \n\\[ a(1) - 3a + 4(1) = 137 \\]  \n\\[ a - 3a + 4 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ -2a + 4 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ -2a = 133 \\]  \n\\[ a = -66.5 \\]  \n**Reflection:**  \nInvalid solution.\n\n**Next, \\( b = 2 \\):**\n\n- **\\( b = 2 \\):**  \n\\[ a(2) - 3a + 4(2) = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 2a - 3a + 8 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ -a + 8 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ -a = 129 \\]  \n\\[ a = -129 \\]  \n**Reflection:**  \nInvalid solution.\n\n**Continue this process for small \\( b \\):**\n\n- **\\( b = 3 \\):**  \n\\[ 3a - 3a + 12 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 12 = 137 \\]  \n**Wait,** this is impossible. **Reflection:**  \nIndicates \\( b = 3 \\) might be a special case.\n\n**Insights:**  \nMaybe higher \\( b \\) values are where the solutions lie, especially those that are multiples of 3 plus 1 or 2.\n\n**Step 6:**  \nLet's skip to higher \\( b \\) values that are \\( 0 \\) or \\( 1 \\) modulo 3.\n\n- **\\( b = 9 \\):**  \n\\[ 9a - 3a + 36 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 6a + 36 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 6a = 101 \\]  \n\\[ a = \\frac{101}{6} \\approx 16.833 \\]  \n**Reflection:**  \nStill not an integer.\n\n**Wait a Moment:**  \nI realize that perhaps factoring could have worked if I had looked at it differently initially. Let me try another approach that combines insights from earlier steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting Strategy 1: Factoring with a Different Perspective**\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nMaybe I can try to rearrange the equation in a way that makes factoring easier.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's see if we can convert the equation into a standard form that can be factored.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nStart with the original equation:  \n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\]\n\n**Step 2:**  \nTry to rearrange it:  \n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b - 137 = 0 \\]  \n\\[ b(a + 4) - 3a = 137 \\]  \n**Reflection:**  \nThis still doesn't look like a straightforward factoring problem.\n\n**But Wait:**  \nMaybe instead of factoring, we can look for patterns or substitutions that simplify the equation.\n\n**Idea:**  \nWhat if we consider \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are close in value? Minimizing \\( |a - b| \\) suggests that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) might be consecutive integers.\n\n**Step 3:**  \nAssume \\( a = b \\pm 1 \\), and see if that leads us to a solution.\n\n**Case 1:**  \nAssume \\( a = b + 1 \\):  \n\\[ (b + 1)b - 3(b + 1) + 4b = 137 \\]  \n\\[ b^2 + b - 3b - 3 + 4b = 137 \\]  \n\\[ b^2 + 2b - 3 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ b^2 + 2b - 140 = 0 \\]  \n**Reflection:**  \nThis is a quadratic equation. Let's solve it.\n\n**Step 4:**  \nSolve the quadratic equation:  \n\\[ b^2 + 2b - 140 = 0 \\]  \nUsing the quadratic formula:  \n\\[ b = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 560}}{2} \\]  \n\\[ b = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{564}}{2} \\]  \n\\[ b = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{141}}{2} \\]  \n\\[ b = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{141} \\]  \n**Wait,** this gives irrational solutions for \\( b \\), which means \\( a \\) wouldn't be an integer either.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis suggests that assuming \\( a = b + 1 \\) doesn't lead to integer solutions. Perhaps \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) differ by more than 1.\n\n**Case 2:**  \nAssume \\( a = b - 1 \\):  \n\\[ (b - 1)b - 3(b - 1) + 4b = 137 \\]  \n\\[ b^2 - b - 3b + 3 + 4b = 137 \\]  \n\\[ b^2 + b + 3 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ b^2 + b - 134 = 0 \\]  \n**Reflection:**  \nAnother quadratic equation. Let's solve it.\n\n**Step 5:**  \nSolve the quadratic equation:  \n\\[ b^2 + b - 134 = 0 \\]  \nUsing the quadratic formula:  \n\\[ b = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 536}}{2} \\]  \n\\[ b = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{537}}{2} \\]  \n\\[ b = \\frac{-1 \\pm 3\\sqrt{59}}{2} \\]  \n**Wait,** similarly, this gives irrational solutions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAssuming \\( a = b \\pm 1 \\) leads to irrational solutions, which means this possibly isn't a valid assumption.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nPerhaps \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) need to differ by a larger integer value.\n\n---\n\n### **Reassessing Approach and Looking for Patterns**\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nGiven that earlier attempts with factoring and assuming \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are close didn't yield integer solutions, let's look for patterns or alternative substitutions.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWe could try different expressions for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) that relate their difference to the equation.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nConsider expressing \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in terms of their difference \\( d = |a - b| \\).\n\n**Idea:**  \nIf \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are close, perhaps their product and linear terms can balance out to equal 137.\n\n**Step 2:**  \nAssume \\( a = b + d \\) or \\( a = b - d \\).\n\n**Case 1:**  \nAssume \\( a = b + d \\):  \n\\[ (b + d)b - 3(b + d) + 4b = 137 \\]  \n\\[ b^2 + db - 3b - 3d + 4b = 137 \\]  \n\\[ b^2 + (d + 1)b - 3d = 137 \\]  \n**Reflection:**  \nThis still seems complex, and introducing \\( d \\) adds another variable. Perhaps this isn't simplifying the problem.\n\n**But Wait:**  \nMaybe instead of introducing \\( d \\), we can look for integer solutions directly or use a different substitution.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**  \nWhat if we rearrange the equation to express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\) and then look for integer solutions?\n\n**Step 3:**  \nRearrange the equation to solve for \\( a \\):  \n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\]  \n\\[ a(b - 3) = 137 - 4b \\]  \n\\[ a = \\frac{137 - 4b}{b - 3} \\]  \n**Reflection:**  \nNow we can test integer values for \\( b \\) to see if \\( a \\) is an integer.\n\n**Step 4:**  \nLet's test various \\( b \\) values, focusing on \\( b \\) that are greater than or equal to 4 (since \\( b \\) must be positive and \\( b - 3 \\neq 0 \\)).\n\n| \\( b \\) | \\( a \\) Calculation | \\( a \\) Value | Valid Solution? | \\( |a - b| \\) |\n|---------|---------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------|\n| 4       | \\( \\frac{137 - 16}{1} = 121 \\)   | 121           | Yes              | 117         |\n| 5       | \\( \\frac{137 - 20}{2} = 58.5 \\)    | 58.5          | No               |             |\n| 6       | \\( \\frac{137 - 24}{3} = 37 \\)      | 37            | Yes              | 31          |\n| 7       | \\( \\frac{137 - 28}{4} = 27.25 \\)   | 27.25         | No               |             |\n| 8       | \\( \\frac{137 - 32}{5} = 21 \\)      | 21            | Yes              | 7           |\n| 9       | \\( \\frac{137 - 36}{6} = 16.833 \\)   | 16.833        | No               |             |\n| 10      | \\( \\frac{137 - 40}{7} = 13.857 \\)   | 13.857        | No               |             |\n| 11      | \\( \\frac{137 - 44}{8} = 11.625 \\)   | 11.625        | No               |             |\n\n**Reflection:**  \nFrom this table:\n\n- **Valid Solutions:**  \n  - \\( b = 4 \\): \\( a = 121 \\), \\( |a - b| = 117 \\)  \n  - \\( b = 6 \\): \\( a = 37 \\), \\( |a - b| = 31 \\)  \n  - \\( b = 8 \\): \\( a = 21 \\), \\( |a - b| = 7 \\)  \n\n- **Invalid Solutions:**  \n  - Non-integer or negative \\( a \\) values for other \\( b \\) values.\n\n**Insights:**  \nThe minimal \\( |a - b| \\) from the valid solutions is \\( 7 \\) when \\( b = 8 \\) and \\( a = 21 \\).\n\n**Check:**  \nLet's double-check the solution for \\( b = 8 \\) and \\( a = 21 \\):\n\n\\[ ab - 3a + 4b = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 21(8) - 3(21) + 4(8) = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 168 - 63 + 32 = 137 \\]  \n\\[ 168 - 63 = 105 \\]  \n\\[ 105 + 32 = 137 \\]  \n**Wait,** the equation holds true.
