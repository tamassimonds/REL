I'll walk through my thought process step by step, exploring different strategies, checking my work, and reflecting often to ensure I'm on the right track. \n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, it reminds me of geometry problems dealing with transformations, specifically rotations. Rotating a triangle around the origin is something I've encountered before, but I need to be careful with the direction and the angle\u201490 degrees clockwise. \n\nInitially, I'm thinking:\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Maybe I can use rotation matrices, which are a standard way to handle these kinds of problems.\n- **Strategy 2:** Alternatively, I could use the predefined rules for rotating points in the Cartesian plane.\n- **Strategy 3:** Perhaps visualizing the rotation could help ensure the correctness of the numerical approach.\n\nBut wait, let me spend a moment considering each option:\n\n- **Rotation Matrices:** These are mathematical tools I know work well, but they involve more calculations, and maybe there's a simpler way.\n- **Predefined Rules:** I remember that for 90-degree clockwise rotations, there's a straightforward formula.\n- **Visualization:** This might help confirm the numerical method, but it could be hard to draw accurately without a graph here.\n\nGiven these options, I think starting with the **Predefined Rules** approach makes the most sense\u2014it's straightforward and should give me a quick answer. If that feels off, I can always fall back on rotation matrices or try visualizing the situation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Predefined Rules for Rotation**\n\nLet's go with the **Predefined Rules** method first.\n\n**Understanding the Rule:**  \nFor a 90-degree clockwise rotation around the origin, the coordinates of a point \\((x, y)\\) transform as follows:\n\n\\[\n(x, y) \\rightarrow (y, -x)\n\\]\n\n**Applying to Point \\( A(-4, 1) \\):**\n\n\\[\nA(-4, 1) \\rightarrow (1, -(-4)) = (1, 4)\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nSo, after rotation, \\( A \\) should be at \\( (1, 4) \\).\n\nBut wait\u2026 That doesn't seem right because point \\( B \\) already has the coordinates \\( (-1, 4) \\). If \\( A \\) maps to \\( (1, 4) \\), maybe there's an error here. \n\nAh, I realize now\u2014perhaps I misapplied the rule. Let me double-check:\n\n**Correct Application:**\n\n\\[\nA(-4, 1) \\rightarrow (1, -(-4)) = (1, 4)\n\\]\n\nThis still gives \\( (1, 4) \\), which overlaps with \\( B \\). But perhaps I'm missing something about the rotation context\u2026\n\nHmm, maybe I've misunderstood the rotation direction or the order of operations. Let me think:\n\n- **Point Overlap:** Could it be possible that after rotation, point \\( A \\) coincides with point \\( B \\)? That seems unlikely unless there's a mistake.\n\n- **Coordinate System Check:** In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the y-coordinate becomes the new x-coordinate, and the negative x-coordinate becomes the new y-coordinate. \n\nMaybe I'm missing the negative sign in the transformation. Let's correct that:\n\n\\[\n(x, y) \\rightarrow (y, -x)\n\\]\n\nSo, applying to \\( A(-4, 1) \\):\n\n\\[\n(-4, 1) \\rightarrow (1, -(-4)) = (1, 4)\n\\]\n\nBut this still overlaps with \\( B \\). I'm puzzled here. \n\n**Reflection:**  \nCould it be that I misinterpreted the rotation direction? A 90-degree clockwise rotation should indeed swap x and y with a negative sign on the new y-coordinate. Yet, the result still overlaps with \\( B \\).\n\nI'm starting to think that perhaps this method isn't providing the clarity I need. Maybe I should try another approach to check the validity of this result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Trying the Rotation Matrix Approach**\n\nSince the predefined rule led to overlapping coordinates, I think it's worth exploring the **Rotation Matrix** method to see if it yields a different, perhaps more accurate result.\n\n**Understanding Rotation Matrices:**  \nTo rotate a point \\( (x, y) \\) around the origin by an angle \\( \\theta \\), the following matrix is applied:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\\n\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFor a 90-degree clockwise rotation, \\( \\theta = -90^\\circ \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\cos(-90^\\circ) = 0, \\quad \\sin(-90^\\circ) = -1\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these values:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Applying to Point \\( A(-4, 1) \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-4 \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nAgain, this yields \\( (1, 4) \\), which overlaps with point \\( B \\). \n\nHmm, this is consistent with the previous result. But, overlapping points suggest that perhaps the rotation places \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) at the same location after the transformation.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIs it possible for two points to overlap after a 90-degree rotation? If the triangle is symmetrical or if the points are aligned in such a way, maybe it can happen. But without additional context, it's hard to say.\n\nTo make sure, I should verify if the rotation preserves the structure of the triangle. \n\nLet's think about it:\n\n- **Triangle Symmetry:** If \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is isosceles or has some other symmetry, it's feasible that a 90-degree rotation could align two points.\n\n- **Alternative Method:** To confirm, I could use a different method, such as visualizing or perhaps considering the other vertices.\n\nBut since the question only asks about the image of point \\( A \\), and both methods yield the same result, maybe the answer is indeed \\( (1, 4) \\), and it just so happens that \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) overlap post-rotation.\n\nStill, let's proceed cautiously to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Visualizing the Rotation**\n\nTo better understand what's happening, let's try to visualize the rotation in the Cartesian plane.\n\n**Initial Position:**\n\n- Point \\( A \\) is at \\( (-4, 1) \\).\n- Point \\( B \\) is at \\( (-1, 4) \\).\n- Point \\( C \\) is at \\( (-1, 1) \\).\n\n**Rotation Details:**\n\n- The triangle is being rotated 90 degrees clockwise around the origin.\n- This means that every point's position is being altered according to the rotation rules.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\nGiven that the rotation is 90 degrees clockwise:\n\n- The x-coordinates should move to the y-coordinates.\n- The y-coordinates should move to the negative x-coordinates.\n\n**Applying to \\( A(-4, 1) \\):**\n\nFollowing the rotation rules:\n\n\\[\n(-4, 1) \\rightarrow (1, -(-4)) = (1, 4)\n\\]\n\nSo, point \\( A \\) moves to \\( (1, 4) \\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nWait\u2014this places point \\( A \\) at the same coordinates as point \\( B \\). This suggests that after rotation, points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) coincide.\n\n**Check:**  \nIs there any issue with this result? \n\n- **Overlapping Points:** While overlapping points can happen with specific rotations, it seems unusual unless the triangle has a specific symmetry that causes it.\n- **Alternative Approach:** To ensure accuracy, let's try a different method, like checking the distance or angle relationships.\n\nBut since both methods lead to the same result, and overlapping points can be a legitimate outcome in this case, it might just be a coincidence of the triangle's configuration.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGiven that both the rotation matrix and predefined rule methods yield the same result, I believe the answer is correct. However, it's always good to double-check by considering the triangle's properties.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying with Distance and Properties**\n\nTo confirm that the rotation has been applied correctly, let's consider the distances and the nature of the triangle.\n\n**Calculating Distances:**\n\nFirst, let's find the side lengths of \\( \\triangle ABC \\):\n\n1. **Length of \\( AB \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{((-1) - (-4))^2 + (4 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{(-1 + 4)^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n2. **Length of \\( AC \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{((-1) - (-4))^2 + (1 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 0} = 3\n\\]\n\n3. **Length of \\( BC \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{((-1) - (-1))^2 + (1 - 4)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + (-3)^2} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Observations:**\n\n- \\( AB = 3\\sqrt{2} \\)\n- \\( AC = 3 \\)\n- \\( BC = 3 \\)\n\n**Properties:**\n\n- **Isosceles Triangle:** \\( AC = BC = 3 \\), so the triangle is isosceles.\n- **Right Triangle:** Given the side lengths, especially \\( AB = 3\\sqrt{2} \\), and the other two sides being 3, this suggests that the triangle might be a right triangle.\n\n**Implications for Rotation:**\n\nIf \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is an isosceles right triangle, a 90-degree rotation would align \\( A \\) with \\( B \\), making them coincide at \\( (1, 4) \\).\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense?\n\nYes, if the triangle is isosceles and right-angled, a 90-degree rotation clockwise would indeed rotate point \\( A \\) to the position of point \\( B \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis matches the result we've obtained through both methods. Therefore, the answer \\( (1, 4) \\) is correct, and point \\( A \\) coincides with point \\( B \\) after the rotation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014predefined rules and rotation matrices\u2014and visualizing the process, both methods consistently lead to the conclusion that the image of point \\( A \\) after a 90-degree clockwise rotation around the origin is \\( (1, 4) \\). \n\nInitially, the overlapping result seemed unusual, but verifying the properties of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) revealed that it is an isosceles right triangle, which explains why points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) coincide post-rotation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe coordinates of the image of point \\( A \\) after the rotation are **\\( (1, 4) \\)**.\n\nThroughout the process, I checked and reflected on each step, ensuring that the approach was correct and aligned with the geometric principles involved. Even though the overlapping points at first seemed unexpected, deeper analysis confirmed the validity of the result. Always being open to re-evaluating and adjusting the strategy led to a clear and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "When we rotate images $90^{\\circ}$ the coordinates switch places, and the signs are adjusted based on whether or not an axis was crossed. In this case, rotating point $A$ $90^{\\circ}$ will bring it across the $y$-axis into Quadrant I, which means both the $x$ and $y$ will be positive. The original point $A$ was at $(-4, 1)$ so the final image will be at $(1, 4)$. We also could solve this problem by seeing that the slope of the segment from the origin to $A$ is $-1/4$. If $A$ is moving to a location that is a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation about the origin, it will move to a point on the segment perpendicular to the one that currently connects it to the origin. This will be the segment that has a slope of 4/1 or $-4/-1$ from the origin which puts us at $(1, 4)$ or $(-1, -4)$. The point $\\boxed{(1, 4)}$ is in the clockwise direction we need."
