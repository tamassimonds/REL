    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking if my approach is correct along the way\u2014just like I would if I were solving this manually.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nThe equation is:\n\n\\[\n(x - 4)^3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-1}\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\n- **Surface Level:** At first glance, I see an expression raised to a power on both sides of the equation. This looks like a typical power equation where I might need to simplify each side to solve for \\(x\\).\n- **Similar Problems:** It reminds me of problems where you have to take roots or apply properties of exponents. Maybe I can use the property that if \\(a^m = a^n\\), then \\(m = n\\) when \\(a \\neq 0\\).\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Simplify Both Sides:** Try to simplify the right-hand side and see if the left can be expanded to match.\n2. **Apply Exponent Rules:** Use properties of exponents to simplify expressions involving powers and negatives.\n3. **Take the Cube Root:** Since the left side is cubed, maybe taking the cube root could help isolate \\(x\\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Simplify Both Sides** seems straightforward, but I need to be careful with exponent rules.\n- **Apply Exponent Rules** might simplify the right side easily.\n- **Take the Cube Root** could directly lead me to \\(x\\), but I should ensure the right side is simplified first.\n\nLet me start by simplifying both sides to see where that leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify the Right-Hand Side**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-1}\n\\]\n\n**Thinking Through It:**\n\n- **Exponent Rule:** I remember that taking the negative exponent means flipping the base. Specifically, \\((a^m)^{-1} = a^{-m} = \\frac{1}{a^m}\\).\n- **Applying It Here:** So, \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-1} = 8^1 = 8\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-1} = 8\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Is 8 the correct inverse of \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)? Yes, because multiplying \\(\\frac{1}{8} \\times 8 = 1\\), which is correct.\n- **Conclusion:** The right side simplifies neatly to 8.\n\n**Update Equation:**\n\n\\[\n(x - 4)^3 = 8\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Apply the Cube Root to Both Sides**\n\nNow that both sides are simplified, let's take the cube root to solve for \\(x - 4\\).\n\n\\[\nx - 4 = \\sqrt[3]{8}\n\\]\n\n**Thinking Through It:**\n\n- **Cube Root of 8:** I know from basic arithmetic that \\(2^3 = 8\\), so the cube root of 8 is 2.\n- **Property of Exponents:** Alternatively, \\(\\sqrt[3]{a^3} = a\\), which confirms that \\(\\sqrt[3]{8} = 2\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx - 4 = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Does taking the cube root make sense here? Yes, because we're dealing with cubes on both sides.\n- **Conclusion:** This step logically follows from simplifying the equation.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\n\\[\nx = 2 + 4 = 6\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solve for \\(x\\)**\n\nNow, adding 4 to both sides to isolate \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = 2 + 4 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Thinking Through It:**\n\n- **Simple Addition:** This is straightforward\u2014reverting the subtraction from the original equation.\n- **Double-Check:** Does adding 4 to 2 correctly solve for \\(x\\) in the context of the problem? Yes.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Does \\(x = 6\\) satisfy the original equation? Let's quickly verify by substituting back.\n- **Conclusion:** Before finalizing, I'll plug \\(x = 6\\) back into the original equation to ensure it's correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verification**\n\n**Original Equation:**\n\n\\[\n(x - 4)^3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-1}\n\\]\n\n**Substituting \\(x = 6\\):**\n\n\\[\n(6 - 4)^3 = 2^3 = 8\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-1} = 8\n\\]\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nBoth sides equal 8, so the equation holds true.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** The solution \\(x = 6\\) satisfies the original equation.\n- **Conclusion:** The steps taken lead to the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Approach worked:** Starting with simplifying both sides was effective. Applying exponent rules helped streamline the process.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Initially considered taking cube roots directly, but simplifying the right side first ensured clarity.\n- **Mistake Check:** No major errors detected; each step logically followed from the previous one.\n- **Final Answer:** \\(x = 6\\)\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with constant reflection and verification, led us to the correct solution by ensuring each part of the process was sound.",
