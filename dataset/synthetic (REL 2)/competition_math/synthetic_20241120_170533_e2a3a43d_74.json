    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this probability problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check if I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed. \n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I think:\n\n- **Similarity to Basic Probability Problems:** This reminds me of basic probability questions where the total probability must equal 1. I\u2019ve done similar problems before, where you have to find the missing probability by subtracting given probabilities from 1.\n\n- **Checking Given Probabilities:** The probabilities for regions A and B are given as \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\), respectively. I recall that all probabilities in a probability distribution must sum up to 1. \n\n- **Possible Approach:** Maybe I can just add the probabilities of A and B, subtract that sum from 1, and see if that gives me the probability for C. \n\n- **Uncertainty:** Wait, before proceeding, I should double-check if adding those fractions directly will work without additional steps, like finding a common denominator.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Add Probabilities of A and B Directly:**\n   - Calculate \\(P(A) + P(B)\\) and subtract from 1 to find \\(P(C)\\).\n\n2. **Check for Common Denominator First:**\n   - Ensure both fractions can be added easily by finding a common denominator before adding.\n\n3. **Alternative Methods:**\n   - Consider other probability rules or properties, but this seems straightforward with the total probability rule.\n\n### **Step 1: Adding Probabilities of A and B**\n\nLet\u2019s try the first strategy: adding the probabilities of A and B directly.\n\n\\[\nP(A) = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad P(B) = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n\n- Does adding these fractions directly make sense? Let's see if a common denominator is needed.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nP(A) + P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Common Denominator:**\n\n- The denominators are 2 and 5. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 5 is 10.\n  \n- I need to convert \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) to fractions with a denominator of 10.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{5}{5} = \\frac{5}{10}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{2} = \\frac{2}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Adding the Fractions:**\n\n\\[\nP(A) + P(B) = \\frac{5}{10} + \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{7}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- So, the sum of probabilities for A and B is \\(\\frac{7}{10}\\).\n\n### **Step 2: Finding Probability of C**\n\nNow, let's find \\(P(C)\\) by subtracting the sum of \\(P(A)\\) and \\(P(B)\\) from 1.\n\n\\[\nP(C) = 1 - P(A) - P(B) = 1 - \\frac{7}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nP(C) = \\frac{10}{10} - \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection and Check**\n\n- Wait, does \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\) make sense as a probability? Let me think: \n  - All probabilities should add up to 1.\n  - \\(\\frac{7}{10} + \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1\\), so it checks out.\n\n- Also, \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\) is a valid probability since it's between 0 and 1.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution Using an Alternative Method**\n\nJust to be sure, let\u2019s check using another strategy: verifying that the total probability equals 1 by adding \\(P(A)\\), \\(P(B)\\), and \\(P(C)\\).\n\n**Given:**\n\n\\[\nP(A) = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad P(B) = \\frac{1}{5}, \\quad P(C) = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Sum of Probabilities:**\n\n\\[\nP(A) + P(B) + P(C) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Common Denominator Again:**\n\n- Using the common denominator of 10:\n  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{10}, \\quad \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{10}, \\quad \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Adding Them Up:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{10} + \\frac{2}{10} + \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- The total is indeed 1, confirming that our probability \\(P(C) = \\frac{3}{10}\\) is correct.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Approach Worked:** Adding the probabilities of A and B and subtracting from 1 was a straightforward and effective method.\n\n- **Verification Confirmed Accuracy:** Checking the sum of all probabilities ensured correctness.\n\n- **Multiple Strategies Helped:** Considering alternative methods reinforced the solution's validity.\n\n- **Reflection Throughout:** Regular checks and reflections ensured the approach remained on track.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability of the arrow stopping on region C is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}\\).",
