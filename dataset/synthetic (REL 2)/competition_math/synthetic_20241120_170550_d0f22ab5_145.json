    "working_out": "### First Thoughts\n\nAlright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. The question is about passing an algebra test at Academic Academy, where you need at least **80%** to pass. There are **35 problems** on the test, so I need to figure out the **greatest number of problems I can miss** and still score **80% or higher**.\n\nWhen I first see this problem, a few things come to mind:\n\n- **Percentage Calculation:** I know that achieving 80% means getting a certain number of problems correct out of 35.\n- **Total Problems:** With 35 problems total, missing too many would drop my score below 80%.\n- **Threshold Check:** I need to calculate the minimum number of problems that must be solved to reach the 80% threshold.\n\nI'm thinking this involves calculating how many problems I need to get right and then determining the maximum I can miss without falling below 80%. But I\u2019m not entirely sure how to set it up initially. Maybe I should start by calculating 80% of 35 to see the exact number of correct answers needed.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate 80% of Total Problems\n\nFirst, let's find out how many problems need to be solved to reach 80%.\n\n\\[\n80\\% \\text{ of } 35 = \\frac{80}{100} \\times 35 = 28\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Okay, so to pass, I need to get at least 28 problems correct. That makes sense because 80% of 35 is 28. \n\n### Step 2: Determine the Greatest Number of Problems to Miss\n\nNow, I need to figure out the maximum number of problems I can miss while still passing. \n\n\\[\n\\text{Total problems} - \\text{Problems needed to pass} = 35 - 28 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** If I miss 7 problems, I\u2019ll still solve 28, which is exactly 80%. That seems logical, but let me check if there's any other strategy that confirms this or if I should validate further.\n\n### Step 3: Double-Checking with Different Approaches\n\n**Approach 1:** **Simple Subtraction (Used Above)**\n\n- Total problems: 35\n- Problems to solve for 80%: 28\n- Maximum misses: \\(35 - 28 = 7\\)\n\n**Approach 2:** **Percentage of Problems Missed**\n\nLet\u2019s see if calculating the percentage of problems I can miss aligns:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage that can be missed} = 100\\% - 80\\% = 20\\%\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate 20% of 35:\n\n\\[\n20\\% \\text{ of } 35 = \\frac{20}{100} \\times 35 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Both approaches lead to the same conclusion\u2014**7** problems can be missed. This consistency gives me more confidence in the answer.\n\n### Step 4: Considering Edge Cases\n\nBefore finalizing, let's consider:\n\n- **Missing Exactly 7 Problems:** Would still achieve 80% (28 correct out of 35).\n- **Missing More than 7 (e.g., 8):** Would fall below 80% (only 27 correct).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage if 8 missed} = \\frac{27}{35} \\times 100\\% \\approx 77.14\\%\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Missing 8 problems results in approximately **77.14%**, which is below 80%. So, missing more than 7 does drop the score below passing, confirming that **7 is indeed the maximum**.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies and double-checking with calculations:\n\n- **Maximum Number of Problems to Miss:** **7**\n- **Verification:** Both percentage approaches align, and edge cases confirm the threshold.\n\nThis step-by-step reflection and checking ensure that the solution is accurate and robust. It\u2019s always good to explore multiple methods and validate the results, especially in percentage-based problems like this one.",

  "ground_truth": "If you must score at least $80 \\%$, then you cannot miss more than $20 \\% = 1/5$ of the problems. $1/5$ of $35$ is equal to $7$, so you can miss at most $\\boxed{7}$ problems and still pass."
