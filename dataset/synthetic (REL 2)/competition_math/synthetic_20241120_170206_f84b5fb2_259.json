    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through it just as one would naturally when faced with a challenging question. Brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and even changing strategies is all part of the process. I'll write out my thoughts, uncertainties, and insights to mimic a human thought process.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, let's dive into the problem:\n\n**Given:**\n- In triangle \\( ABC \\), \\( \\cos(2A - B) + \\sin(A + B) = 2 \\)\n- \\( AB = 4 \\)\n  \n**Question:** What is \\( BC \\)?\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Trig Functions:** The equation involves cosine and sine functions of angles. This reminds me of trigonometric identities.\n- **Angle Relationships:** Maybe using angle sum and difference identities could help?\n- **Law of Sines or Cosines:** Since we have side lengths and angles, perhaps these laws will be useful.\n- **Value of Trig Functions:** Wait, the maximum value of \\( \\cos \\) and \\( \\sin \\) is 1, so \\( \\cos(2A - B) + \\sin(A + B) = 2 \\) implies both are at their maximum...\n\n**Hesitation:** This equation sets \\(\\cos(2A - B) + \\sin(A + B) = 2\\), which seems unusual because the maximum of each trigonometric function is 1. So, both must be 1 simultaneously. How can that happen? Hmm... This makes me suspect that at least one angle is fixed to achieve this.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Maximum Values:** Since \\( \\cos(x) \\) and \\( \\sin(x) \\) can each only be 1 at specific angles, having their sum equal to 2 means that both must individually be 1.\n- **Implications:** This is quite restrictive. It suggests that \\( 2A - B = 0 \\) and \\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\) because that's when \\( \\cos \\) and \\( \\sin \\) reach their maxima of 1.\n\n**Possible Insight:** Wait, if both conditions are met, perhaps there's a specific relationship between angles \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). But can this happen in a triangle where the sum of angles is \\( 180^\\circ \\)?\n\n**Thought Process:** Let me explore this further. If \\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\), then \\( C = 90^\\circ - (A + B) = 0^\\circ \\). This implies a degenerate triangle, which is unusual. But maybe that's the only way to satisfy the given equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1:** **Assume \\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\)**\n- If \\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\), then \\( \\sin(A + B) = \\sin 90^\\circ = 1 \\).\n- For \\( \\cos(2A - B) + \\sin(A + B) = 2\\), this means \\( \\cos(2A - B) = 1 \\), so \\( 2A - B = 0^\\circ \\).\n\n**Check:** Does this work?\n- **Equation Simplification:**\n  \\[\n  \\cos(2A - B) + \\sin(A + B) = 1 + 1 = 2\n  \\]\n  This satisfies the equation. So, assuming \\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\) and \\( 2A - B = 0^\\circ \\) works.\n\n**Strategy 2:** **Use Law of Sines or Cosines**\n- Since we now have relationships between angles, perhaps we can relate them to side lengths using the Law of Sines.\n\n**Hesitation:** But wait, we have already found a consistent set of angle relationships. Introducing the Law of Sines might complicate things. Let's stick with our angle assumptions for now.\n\n**Reflection:** Maybe it's better to proceed with finding side lengths based on our established angle relationships before diving into the Law of Sines.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementing Strategy 1**\n\n**Given Relationships:**\n1. \\( 2A - B = 0^\\circ \\) \u21d2 \\( 2A = B \\) \u21d2 \\( A = \\frac{B}{2} \\)\n2. \\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\)\n\n**Solving for Angles:**\n- From \\( A = \\frac{B}{2} \\), substitute into \\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{B}{2} + B = 90^\\circ \\implies \\frac{3B}{2} = 90^\\circ \\implies B = 60^\\circ\n  \\]\n- Therefore, \\( A = \\frac{B}{2} = \\frac{60^\\circ}{2} = 30^\\circ \\)\n- Angle \\( C = 180^\\circ - (A + B) = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 90^\\circ \\)\n\n**Check:** This gives us a triangle where:\n- \\( A = 30^\\circ \\)\n- \\( B = 60^\\circ \\)\n- \\( C = 90^\\circ \\)\n\n**Reflection:** So, we have a right triangle with angle \\( C \\) as \\( 90^\\circ \\). That seems consistent.\n\n**Thought Process:** Now that we have the angles, we can relate them to the side lengths using the Law of Sines or other trigonometric relationships. Since angle \\( A \\) is \\( 30^\\circ \\) and \\( C \\) is \\( 90^\\circ \\), this reminds me of the special right triangle ratios.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying the Law of Sines**\n\n**Law of Sines Formula:**\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}\n\\]\nWhere:\n- \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\) are the sides opposite angles \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) respectively.\n\n**Given:**\n- \\( AB = c = 4 \\) (since \\( AB \\) is opposite angle \\( C \\))\n- Angles identified: \\( A = 30^\\circ \\), \\( B = 60^\\circ \\), \\( C = 90^\\circ \\)\n\n**Find \\( BC = a \\):**\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{\\sin 30^\\circ} = \\frac{4}{\\sin 90^\\circ}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin 30^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\sin 90^\\circ = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{4}{1} \\implies a = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\\[\na = 2\n\\]\n  \n**Check:** So, \\( BC = 2 \\). Does this make sense?\n\n**Reflection:** Given the angles, this aligns with the properties of a \\( 30^\\circ\\)-\\( 60^\\circ\\)-\\( 90^\\circ \\) triangle. In such triangles, the side ratios opposite these angles are \\( 1 : \\sqrt{3} : 2 \\). Since \\( \\sin 30^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2} \\) and angle \\( C \\) is opposite the side of length 4, it checks out.\n\n**Thought Process:** The Law of Sines confirms our earlier assumption about the angle relationships, providing a consistent result for \\( BC \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Use Special Right Triangle Properties**\n\n**Brainstorming:** Instead of using the Law of Sines, let's leverage the properties of a \\( 30^\\circ\\)-\\( 60^\\circ\\)-\\( 90^\\circ \\) triangle since we determined the angles align with this type.\n\n**Triangle Properties:**\n- In a \\( 30^\\circ\\)-\\( 60^\\circ\\)-\\( 90^\\circ \\) triangle:\n  - The side opposite the \\( 30^\\circ \\) angle is the shortest.\n  - The side opposite the \\( 60^\\circ \\) angle is longer than the side opposite the \\( 30^\\circ \\) angle by a factor of \\( \\sqrt{3} \\).\n  - The hypotenuse is twice the length of the side opposite the \\( 30^\\circ \\) angle.\n\n**Applying These Ratios:**\n- Given \\( AB = 4 \\), which is the hypotenuse:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Hypotenuse } (AB) = 2 \\times \\text{side opposite } 30^\\circ\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  4 = 2 \\times \\text{side opposite } 30^\\circ \\implies \\text{side opposite } 30^\\circ = 2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Side opposite } 60^\\circ = 2 \\times \\sqrt{3} \\approx 3.46\n  \\]\n  \n**Check:** This aligns with our previous calculation using the Law of Sines.\n\n**Reflection:** Using the properties of special right triangles provides an intuitive check on our earlier calculations, ensuring consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Verification**\n\n**Verification of All Steps:**\n- **Angle Calculations:** Assuming \\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\) led us to determine \\( A = 30^\\circ \\) and \\( B = 60^\\circ \\).\n- **Side Lengths:** Applying the Law of Sines confirmed \\( BC = 2 \\).\n- **Alternative Approach:** Leveraging triangle properties also resulted in \\( BC = 2 \\).\n\n**Check for Consistency:**\n- Both strategies converge to the same side length for \\( BC \\), validating the correctness of our approach.\n- The properties of the \\( 30^\\circ\\)-\\( 60^\\circ\\)-\\( 90^\\circ \\) triangle align with the calculated side ratios.\n\n**Final Reflection:** The initial assumption about the angle relationships was critical in solving the problem. Exploring different strategies\u2014both the Law of Sines and special triangle properties\u2014ensured accuracy and provided a comprehensive understanding of the solution.\n\n**Conclusion:** The length of \\( BC \\) is **2**.\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically, exploring various strategies, and reflecting at each step, we arrived at the correct solution while ensuring each part of the process was logical and consistent.",
