I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, jotting down my initial thoughts, exploring different approaches, reflecting on each step, and making sure I check my work continuously, just like how I'd naturally tackle a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see this question, it reminds me of concepts involving vectors and perhaps parallel lines or planes. The equation given involves two vector equations set equal to each other with parameters \\( t \\) and \\( s \\). Initially, I think about:\n\n- **Vector Equations:** Maybe these represent lines in space, and we're looking for conditions under which they don't intersect.\n- **Concurrent Lines:** If the lines are parallel, they might not have solutions unless they're coincident.\n- **Value of \\( k \\):** The real number \\( k \\) seems to be a parameter that makes the lines parallel or otherwise non-intersecting.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to proceed right away. It feels a bit reminiscent of solving systems of equations, but with vectors involved, which adds a layer of complexity.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Parameter Matching:** Attempt to match coefficients of \\( t \\) and \\( s \\) to see if that leads to a contradiction.\n   \n2. **Vector Representation:** Visualize the problem geometrically\u2014perhaps these are lines in 2D space, and \\( k \\) affects the slope or direction.\n\n3. **Determinant Approach:** Maybe use determinants to check if the vectors are linearly dependent, which would imply parallel lines.\n\n4. **Fixed Point:** Consider if there's a fixed point where both lines could meet, but since we need no solutions, this seems less likely to help.\n\nAt this point, *Parameter Matching* and *Determinant Approach* seem the most promising, but I'll start with parameter matching and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting Parameter Matching**\n\nLet's write out both vector equations clearly:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -7 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix} + s \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ k \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to two separate equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 3 + 4t \\\\ 5 - 7t \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 - s \\\\ -2 + ks \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSo, I can set up two equations:\n\n1. \\( 3 + 4t = 2 - s \\)\n2. \\( 5 - 7t = -2 + ks \\)\n\nNow, let's solve the first equation for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[\ns = 2 - 3 - 4t = -1 - 4t\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( s = -1 - 4t \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\n5 - 7t = -2 + k(-1 - 4t) = -2 - k - 4kt\n\\]\n\nRearrange terms to bring all \\( t \\)-terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n5 - 7t + 4kt = -2 - k\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5 + k - 2 = 7t - 4kt\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3 + k = t(7 - 4k)\n\\]\n\nAt this point, *if* \\( 7 - 4k = 0 \\), then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n3 + k = 0\n\\]\n\nBut we need to find \\( k \\) such that **no solutions exist**. So, setting \\( 7 - 4k = 0 \\) implies:\n\n\\[\n4k = 7 \\implies k = \\frac{7}{4}\n\\]\n\n*Wait a moment...* If \\( k = \\frac{7}{4} \\), the lines might be parallel, but I need to double-check whether this truly results in no solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection: Checking the Approach**\n\n*Checking my work:* Setting \\( 7 - 4k = 0 \\) leads to \\( k = \\frac{7}{4} \\). This suggests that the direction vectors become parallel, which could mean the lines are parallel but not coincident.\n\nBut could there be other values of \\( k \\) that also lead to no solutions? Maybe parallel but different intercepts, or perhaps lines that are not parallel but still don't intersect?\n\nI realize that I should verify whether \\( k = \\frac{7}{4} \\) indeed makes the lines non-intersecting and whether it's the only such \\( k \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying \\( k = \\frac{7}{4} \\)**\n\nLet's check what happens when \\( k = \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( k = \\frac{7}{4} \\) into the adjusted equation:\n\n\\[\n3 + \\frac{7}{4} = t(7 - 4 \\times \\frac{7}{4}) \\\\\n3 + \\frac{7}{4} = t(7 - 7) \\\\\n3 + \\frac{7}{4} = t \\times 0 \\\\\n\\frac{19}{4} = 0\n\\]\n\n*Hmm...* This results in an inconsistency: \\( \\frac{19}{4} \\neq 0 \\). This suggests that when \\( k = \\frac{7}{4} \\), the equation doesn't hold, indicating no solutions exist.\n\nSo, it seems that \\( k = \\frac{7}{4} \\) is indeed a value that makes the lines have no solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Other Possibilities**\n\n*But is \\( k = \\frac{7}{4} \\) the only value?* Let's consider if there are other values of \\( k \\) that also make the lines have no solutions.\n\nRecall that two lines don't intersect if:\n\n- They are parallel and distinct (equal direction vectors but different points).\n- They are coincident (but this would mean they overlap, so not applicable here).\n- In higher dimensions, they could be skew lines, but since we're in 2D, this doesn't apply.\n\nGiven the form of the equations, it seems that having the direction vectors become parallel (i.e., \\( 7 - 4k = 0 \\)) is sufficient to ensure no solutions, provided the lines have different points.\n\n*So, I tentatively conclude that \\( k = \\frac{7}{4} \\) is likely the only value that meets the condition.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check**\n\nLet's quickly summarize and check if everything makes sense:\n\n- **Original Equations:** Set up correctly.\n- **Parameter Matching:** Led to \\( s = -1 - 4t \\) and \\( 3 + k = t(7 - 4k) \\).\n- **Condition for No Solutions:** \\( 7 - 4k = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( k = \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n- **Verification:** Substituting \\( k = \\frac{7}{4} \\) led to an inconsistency, confirming no solutions exist.\n\n*Everything seems to align. The approach works and leads to a coherent conclusion.*\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming and exploring different strategies, I determined that the value of \\( k \\) that makes the given vector equation have no solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{7}{4}}\n\\]\n\nThis value ensures that the direction vectors become parallel, leading to no solutions unless the lines are coincident, which they are not in this case.\n\n---\n\n*Reflecting on the process:* Starting with parameter matching helped identify the condition for no solutions. Verifying the result ensured the correctness, and considering whether other values of \\( k \\) could also lead to the same outcome confirmed that \\( k = \\frac{7}{4} \\) is indeed the solution.",

This implies that the two lines are parallel.  In turn, this means that the direction vector of one line is a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the other line.  Hence, there exists a constant $c$ such that\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -7 \\end{pmatrix} = c \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -c \\\\ ck \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Then $-c = 4$, so $c = -4$.
