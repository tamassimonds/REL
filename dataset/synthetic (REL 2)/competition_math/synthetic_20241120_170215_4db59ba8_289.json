Brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work frequently, and being open to changing methods if something doesn't seem right are all part of the process. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, **\"What is the period of \\( y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\)?\"**, several things come to mind:\n\n- **Familiarity with Trigonometric Functions**: I know that trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent have specific periods. The standard period for tangent is \\( 2\\pi \\), but this one has a \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) inside, which reminds me of how the period is affected by transformations.\n\n- **Possible Strategies**:\n  1. **Recall the Period of Basic Trigonometric Functions**: Maybe just apply what I know about the period of \\( \\tan(x) \\) and see how the \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) modifies it.\n  2. **Graphical Approach**: Visualizing the graph of \\( \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\) might help in identifying the period.\n  3. **Mathematical Derivation Using Definitions**: Use the definition of the period to set up an equation and solve for the period.\n\n- **Initial Uncertainty**: I'm not entirely sure which approach will be the most straightforward. The graphical method might provide intuitive insight, while recalling the properties of tangent could be quicker. Maybe starting with the properties and then confirming with a graph would be best.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Recall the Period of Basic Trigonometric Functions**\n\nLet me start by recalling how the period of the tangent function is affected by transformations.\n\n- **Standard Period of Tangent**: The basic tangent function, \\( y = \\tan(x) \\), has a period of \\( \\pi \\).\n  \n- **Effect of Coefficient Inside the Argument**: When the argument of the tangent function is multiplied by a coefficient, the period changes. Specifically, if \\( y = \\tan(kx) \\), the period is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{|k|} \\).\n  \n- **Applying This to the Given Function**: In \\( y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\), the coefficient \\( k \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), so I would expect the period to be \\( \\frac{\\pi}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\pi \\).\n\n**Quick Check**: This makes sense because multiplying the input by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\ would stretch the graph horizontally, doubling the period compared to \\( y = \\tan(x) \\).\n\n**Reflection**: Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check if this aligns with the definition of the period.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Define the Period Mathematically**\n\nTo be sure, I'll define the period mathematically.\n\n- **Definition of Period**: The period \\( T \\) of a function \\( y = f(x) \\) is the smallest positive number such that \\( f(x + T) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( f \\).\n  \n- **Applying to \\( y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\)**: So, I need to find the smallest \\( T \\) such that:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\tan \\frac{x + T}{2} = \\tan \\frac{x}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Using the Properties of Tangent**: Recall that \\( \\tan(\\theta) \\) is periodic with period \\( \\pi \\), meaning:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\tan(\\theta + \\pi) = \\tan(\\theta)\n  \\]\n  \n  Setting \\( \\theta = \\frac{x}{2} \\), I get:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\tan \\left(\\frac{x}{2} + \\pi\\right) = \\tan \\frac{x}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Relating This Back to \\( T \\)**:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{x + T}{2} = \\frac{x}{2} + \\pi \\Rightarrow T = 2\\pi\n  \\]\n\n**Check**: This matches the earlier conclusion from the first strategy.\n\n**Reflection**: Both strategies lead to the same result, \\( T = 2\\pi \\). I feel more confident now that this is the correct period.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure that \\( T = 2\\pi \\) makes sense:\n\n- **Impact on the Graph**: If the period is \\( 2\\pi \\), it means that the graph of \\( y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\) repeats itself every \\( 2\\pi \\) units horizontally. This aligns with the expectation that increasing the period by a factor of 2 is consistent with the \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) coefficient inside the tangent.\n\n- **Comparison with Standard Tan Graph**: The standard \\( y = \\tan(x) \\) has vertical asymptotes at \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi \\) (where \\( n \\) is an integer). For \\( y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\), the vertical asymptotes would be at:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi \\Rightarrow x = \\pi + 2n\\pi\n  \\]\n  \n  This confirms that the period is indeed \\( 2\\pi \\), as the distance between consecutive asymptotes is \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\n**Final Reflection**: Everything checks out. The period \\( T = 2\\pi \\) is consistent across different approaches and aligns with the properties of the tangent function.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe period of \\( y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\) is **\\( 2\\pi \\)**.\n\n---\n\nBy brainstorming multiple strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the calculations, I've ensured that the approach is correct and the final answer is reliable. This methodical check-and-recheck process mimics human thinking, incorporating doubts, realizations, and confirmations along the way.",
