Here's what comes to mind:\n\n- **Understanding Logarithms:** I remember that logarithms are the inverse of exponentiation. So, \\(\\log_b(a) = c\\) means \\(b^c = a\\). This fundamental idea might help in rewriting the expression.\n  \n- **Changing Base:** Maybe I can change the base to something more familiar like \\(\\log_6\\) or \\(\\log_{36}\\), since \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) can be expressed as \\(6^{1/2}\\). \n\n- **Expressing \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) as Exponents:** Thinking about exponents, I recall that \\(\\sqrt{6} = 6^{1/2}\\), which might make it easier to handle the base in the logarithm.\n\n- **Breaking Down \\(216\\sqrt{6}\\):** I remember that \\(216 = 6^3\\), so perhaps factoring \\(216\\sqrt{6}\\) into powers of \\(6\\) could simplify things.\n\n- **Exploring Different Strategies:** Should I use properties of logarithms like the product rule, or maybe apply the change of base formula? I'm not entirely sure which path is the quickest.\n\nLet me jot down these initial thoughts and see where they lead me. If one approach doesn't work, I'll adjust and try another.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Change of Base Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI think changing the base of the logarithm might help because \\(\\log_{\\sqrt{6}}(216\\sqrt{6})\\) looks tricky with \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) as the base. Changing it to a base like \\(6\\) might make it easier to apply logarithmic properties.\n\n**Step 1: Express \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) as an Exponent**\n\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt{6}}(216\\sqrt{6}) = \\log_{6^{1/2}}(216\\sqrt{6})\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Change of Base Formula**\n\nThe change of base formula states:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{b}(a) = \\frac{\\log_{k}(a)}{\\log_{k}(b)}\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s choose base \\(6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\log_{6^{1/2}}(216\\sqrt{6}) = \\frac{\\log_{6}(216\\sqrt{6})}{\\log_{6}(6^{1/2})}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Denominator**\n\n\\[\n\\log_{6}(6^{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\quad \\text{(because \\(\\log_{6}(6) = 1\\))}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the Numerator \\(\\log_{6}(216\\sqrt{6})\\)**\n\nWait a minute. To simplify \\(\\log_{6}(216\\sqrt{6})\\), I need to break it down:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{6}(216\\sqrt{6}) = \\log_{6}(216) + \\log_{6}(\\sqrt{6})\n\\]\n\n**Thought Reflection:**\nThis seems promising. I know \\(216 = 6^3\\) and \\(\\sqrt{6} = 6^{1/2}\\). Let me compute each part.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate \\(\\log_{6}(216)\\) and \\(\\log_{6}(\\sqrt{6})\\)**\n\n\\[\n\\log_{6}(216) = \\log_{6}(6^3) = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_{6}(\\sqrt{6}) = \\log_{6}(6^{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Numerator**\n\n\\[\n\\log_{6}(216\\sqrt{6}) = 3 + \\frac{1}{2} = 3.5\n\\]\n\n**Step 7: Plug Back into Change of Base Formula**\n\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt{6}}(216\\sqrt{6}) = \\frac{\\log_{6}(216\\sqrt{6})}{\\log_{6}(\\sqrt{6})} = \\frac{3.5}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 3.5 \\times 2 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this make sense? Let me think. If \\(\\log_{\\sqrt{6}}(216\\sqrt{6}) = 7\\), then \\((\\sqrt{6})^7\\) should equal \\(216\\sqrt{6}\\). Let's verify.\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{6})^7 = (\\sqrt{6})^6 \\times \\sqrt{6} = (6^{1/2})^6 \\times \\sqrt{6} = 6^3 \\times \\sqrt{6} = 216\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nYes, it checks out. So, the answer is **7**.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Simplifying the Logarithm Without Change of Base**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nWait, perhaps there's a more straightforward way without changing the base. Maybe I can apply logarithmic properties directly.\n\n**Step 1: Rewrite \\(\\log_{\\sqrt{6}}(216\\sqrt{6})\\) Using Exponents**\n\nLet\u2019s recall that \\(\\log_{b}(a) = c\\) implies \\(b^c = a\\). So, I need \\((\\sqrt{6})^c = 216\\sqrt{6}\\).\n\n**Step 2: Express Both Sides in Terms of Base 6**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{6})^c = 216\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nExpress \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) as \\(6^{1/2}\\):\n\n\\[\n(6^{1/2})^c = 6^3 \\times 6^{1/2} = 6^{3.5}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Reflection:**\nSo, \\((6^{1/2})^c = 6^{3.5}\\). By the properties of exponents, \\(6^{c/2} = 6^{3.5}\\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{2} = 3.5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c = 3.5 \\times 2 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nLet me quickly verify. If \\(c = 7\\), then \\((\\sqrt{6})^7 = 6^{3.5} = 216\\sqrt{6}\\), which matches the right side.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis approach also leads to the same answer: **7**.\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Reflection**\n\nBoth strategies arrived at the same conclusion, which reassures me that the solution is correct. Initially, I considered changing the base of the logarithm, which led me through a detailed process involving breaking down the logarithm into simpler parts. Alternatively, I realized that by expressing both sides in terms of exponents and applying properties of exponents directly, I could arrive at the solution more straightforwardly.\n\nIt's essential to explore different methods to find the most efficient path, especially in logarithmic problems where properties can simplify expressions significantly. Reflecting and checking each step ensured accuracy, and the consistency of the result across different strategies confirms the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\log_{\\sqrt{6}}(216\\sqrt{6}) = 7\\)\n\nLet me know if you need further exploration or another approach!",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x= \\log_{\\sqrt{6}}(216\\sqrt{6})$.  Putting this in exponential notation gives $(\\sqrt{6})^x = 216\\sqrt{6}$.  Writing both sides with $6$ as the base gives us $6^{\\frac{x}{2}} = 6^3\\cdot 6^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 6^{\\frac{7}{2}}$, so $x/2=7/2$.  Therefore, $x=\\boxed{7}$."
