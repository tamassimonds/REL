I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking if I'm on the right path, and making adjustments as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first read the question:  \n**\"The square of an integer is 182 greater than the integer itself. What is the sum of all integers for which this is true?\"**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This seems to involve an equation relating an integer and its square. It reminds me of problems where you set up a quadratic equation.\n- **Possible Approaches:**\n  1. **Set Up a Quadratic Equation:** This feels like a typical \"square and linear relationship\" problem.\n  2. **Factorization Approach:** Maybe I can factorize after setting up the equation.\n  3. **Graphical Interpretation:** Thinking about where the quadratic intersects a certain value.\n\nBut honestly, setting up the equation looks like the most straightforward starting point. Let me go ahead with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe problem states that the square of an integer \\( n \\) is 182 greater than the integer itself. So mathematically, I can express this as:\n\n\\[\nn^2 = n + 182\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This makes sense because it directly translates the problem statement into an equation. No ambiguity here.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes \\( n^2 = n + 182 \\) correctly represent the problem?  \n- **Quick Check:** If \\( n = 10 \\), then \\( 10^2 = 100 \\) and \\( 10 + 182 = 192 \\). But \\( 100 \\neq 192 \\), so \\( n = 10 \\) is not a solution. That\u2019s okay; just a quick check to ensure the equation is set up correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Rearranging the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo make it easier to solve, let's bring all terms to one side of the equation:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - n - 182 = 0\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This looks like a standard quadratic equation. I remember that quadratic equations can be solved by factoring, using the quadratic formula, or completing the square.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes rearranging make solving easier?  \n- **Quick Check:** Yes, having all terms on one side is standard for solving quadratic equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Trying to Factor the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s see if this quadratic equation can be factored easily. I know that for \\( n^2 - n - 182 = 0 \\), we need two numbers that multiply to \\(-182\\) and add up to \\(-1\\) (the coefficient of \\( n \\)).\n\n\\[\nn^2 - n - 182 = (n - a)(n + b)\n\\]\n\n- **Possible Pair:**  \n  - Multiply: \\( a \\times (-b) = -182 \\)  \n  - Add: \\( a + (-b) = -1 \\)  \n\nHmm, this doesn\u2019t look immediately obvious. Let me think about possible pairs.\n\n**Possible Factors of \\(-182\\):**  \n- \\(-1\\) and \\(182\\)  \n- \\(1\\) and \\(-182\\)  \n- \\(-2\\) and \\(91\\)  \n- \\(2\\) and \\(-91\\)  \n- \\(-7\\) and \\(26\\)  \n- \\(7\\) and \\(-26\\)  \n\n**Checking:**  \n- \\(-7\\) and \\(26\\):  \n  - Multiply: \\(-7 \\times 26 = -182\\)  \n  - Add: \\(-7 + 26 = 19\\) (Doesn\u2019t match \\(-1\\))  \n  \n  - **Reflection:** Wait, that's not right. Let\u2019s try another pair.\n\n- Let me try \\(1\\) and \\(-182\\):  \n  - Multiply: \\(1 \\times (-182) = -182\\)  \n  - Add: \\(1 + (-182) = -181\\) (Doesn\u2019t match \\(-1\\))  \n  \n  - **Reflection:** So factoring isn't working easily. Maybe I should try the quadratic formula instead.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince factoring isn't straightforward, let's apply the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nFor our equation \\( n^2 - n - 182 = 0 \\):  \n- \\( a = 1 \\)  \n- \\( b = -1 \\)  \n- \\( c = -182 \\)  \n\n**Calculations:**  \n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-1)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-182) = 1 + 728 = 729\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{729}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{1 \\pm 27}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo,  \n\\[\nn = \\frac{28}{2} = 14 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n = \\frac{-26}{2} = -13\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n- **Solutions:** \\( n = 14 \\) and \\( n = -13 \\)  \n- **Reflection:** These solutions seem reasonable. Let me verify them against the original problem statement.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIt\u2019s essential to check if these values satisfy the original condition: \"The square of an integer is 182 greater than the integer itself.\"\n\n**For \\( n = 14 \\):**  \n\\[\n14^2 = 196 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 14 + 182 = 196\n\\]\n- **Check:** \\( 196 = 196 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**For \\( n = -13 \\):**  \n\\[\n(-13)^2 = 169 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -13 + 182 = 169\n\\]\n- **Check:** \\( 169 = 169 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **Reflection:** Both solutions satisfy the condition. This confirms that our quadratic formula approach was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Finding the Sum of All Valid Integers**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe problem asks for the sum of all integers that satisfy the condition. We've found two solutions: \\( n = 14 \\) and \\( n = -13 \\). Let's sum them up.\n\n\\[\n14 + (-13) = 1\n\\]\n\n- **Check:**  \n  - **Quick Check:** Adding \\( 14 \\) and \\( -13 \\) gives \\( 1 \\). That seems straightforward.\n  - **Deep Reflection:** The sum makes sense numerically. Since \\( -13 \\) is the opposite of \\( 13 \\), and \\( 14 \\) is just \\( 1 \\) more than \\( 13 \\), their sum is indeed \\( 1 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring Completeness**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore concluding, let's ensure that we've considered all possible solutions. The original equation was quadratic, which typically means there can be two solutions. We've already found and verified both.\n\n**Checking for Other Strategies:**  \n- **Graphical Approach:** Plotting \\( n^2 \\) and \\( n + 182 \\) would intersect at \\( n = 14 \\) and \\( n = -13 \\). This aligns with our algebraic solutions.\n- **Alternative Factoring:** Attempting to factor didn't work immediately, but that's okay because the quadratic formula provided the correct solutions.\n\n- **Reflection:** Given that all methods lead to the same solution, and both solutions satisfy the original condition, I'm confident in the correctness of the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, setting up and solving the quadratic equation, verifying the solutions, and ensuring that no possibilities were overlooked, the sum of all integers for which the square is 182 greater than the integer itself is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\n- **Final Reflection:** By brainstorming various approaches and being open to changing methods when one didn\u2019t seem to work, I was able to arrive at the correct solution confidently. Checking each step ensured that the final answer was accurate and complete.",

  "ground_truth": "Let our integer be $x$.  Then we have that $x^2 = 182 + x$, or $x^2 - x - 182 = 0$.  The sum of the roots of this equation is just $-(-1) = \\boxed{1}$.  Note that we are given that one solution is an integer, and so the other one must be as well since they add to 1.\n\nNote that we can factor $x^2 - x - 182 = 0$ as $(x - 14)(x + 13) = 0$.  So the integers that work are 14 and $-13$, and their sum is $14 + (-13) = 1,$ as expected."
