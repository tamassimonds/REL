Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll tackle it step by step:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n- **Question:** What is the sum of the digits of the base \\(7\\) representation of \\(777_{10}\\)?\n  \n- **Initial Reaction:** \n  - Okay, I've dealt with base conversions before. I remember needing to divide by the new base and keep track of remainders.\n  - But wait, \\(777_{10}\\) is a pretty large number. Maybe there\u2019s another method to verify or streamline the process?\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Direct Base Conversion:** Convert \\(777_{10}\\) to base \\(7\\) by repeated division.\n  2. **Use Powers of 7:** Break down \\(777\\) using powers of \\(7\\) to see how it fits.\n  3. **Check with Modulo Operations:** Use modulo \\(7\\) to check remainders and validate steps.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** \n  - Both direct conversion and using powers seem valid. I\u2019m not entirely sure if starting with powers will make it easier. \n  - Let\u2019s try the **Direct Base Conversion** first and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Direct Base Conversion**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - To convert from decimal (base \\(10\\)) to another base (base \\(7\\)), I need to divide the number by \\(7\\) repeatedly and keep track of the remainders.\n  - The remainders will represent the digits in base \\(7\\), starting from the least significant digit (rightmost).\n\n- **Steps:**\n\n  1. **Divide \\(777\\) by \\(7\\):**\n     \\[\n     777 \\div 7 = 111 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 0\n     \\]\n     - \\(\\text{Remainder: } 0\\)\n\n  2. **Divide \\(111\\) by \\(7\\):**\n     \\[\n     111 \\div 7 = 15 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 6\n     \\]\n     - \\(\\text{Remainder: } 6\\)\n\n  3. **Divide \\(15\\) by \\(7\\):**\n     \\[\n     15 \\div 7 = 2 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 1\n     \\]\n     - \\(\\text{Remainder: } 1\\)\n\n  4. **Divide \\(2\\) by \\(7\\):**\n     \\[\n     2 \\div 7 = 0 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 2\n     \\]\n     - \\(\\text{Remainder: } 2\\)\n\n- **Collecting Remainders:**\n  - Reading from bottom to top, the base \\(7\\) representation of \\(777_{10}\\) is \\(2160_7\\).\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - Does the base \\(7\\) number make sense? \n  - \\(2 \\times 7^3 + 1 \\times 7^2 + 6 \\times 7^1 + 0 \\times 7^0 = 2 \\times 343 + 1 \\times 49 + 6 \\times 7 + 0 = 686 + 49 + 42 + 0 = 777\\).\n  - **Reflection:** Yes, this matches the original number. So the conversion seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Summing the Digits of the Base \\(7\\) Representation**\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - Now, add the digits of \\(2160_7\\):\n    \\[\n    2 + 1 + 6 + 0 = 9\n    \\]\n\n- **Thought Check:**\n  - Does adding these digits seem reasonable? \n  - There are only four digits, and each is less than \\(7\\), so the sum should be manageable.\n  - **Reflection:** Everything checks out. The sum is \\(9\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach with Powers of \\(7\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - To ensure accuracy, let's verify by breaking down \\(777\\) using powers of \\(7\\) and see if we arrive at the same base \\(7\\) representation.\n  \n- **Steps:**\n  \n  1. **Identify Powers of \\(7\\):**\n     \\[\n     7^0 = 1, \\quad 7^1 = 7, \\quad 7^2 = 49, \\quad 7^3 = 343, \\quad 7^4 = 2401\n     \\]\n     - \\(7^4\\) is too large (\\(2401 > 777\\)), so we'll use up to \\(7^3\\).\n  \n  2. **Determine Coefficients:**\n     - **Fit \\(7^3 = 343\\) into \\(777\\):**\n       \\[\n       777 \\div 343 = 2 \\quad (\\text{whole number})\n       \\]\n       - So, the coefficient for \\(7^3\\) is \\(2\\).\n       \n       \\[\n       777 - 2 \\times 343 = 777 - 686 = 91\n       \\]\n       \n     - **Fit \\(7^2 = 49\\) into \\(91\\):**\n       \\[\n       91 \\div 49 = 1 \\quad (\\text{whole number})\n       \\]\n       - Coefficient for \\(7^2\\) is \\(1\\).\n       \n       \\[\n       91 - 1 \\times 49 = 91 - 49 = 42\n       \\]\n       \n     - **Fit \\(7^1 = 7\\) into \\(42\\):**\n       \\[\n       42 \\div 7 = 6 \\quad (\\text{whole number})\n       \\]\n       - Coefficient for \\(7^1\\) is \\(6\\).\n       \n       \\[\n       42 - 6 \\times 7 = 42 - 42 = 0\n       \\]\n       \n     - **Fit \\(7^0 = 1\\) into \\(0\\):**\n       \\[\n       0 \\div 1 = 0 \\quad (\\text{whole number})\n       \\]\n       - Coefficient for \\(7^0\\) is \\(0\\).\n  \n  3. **Constructing the Base \\(7\\) Number:**\n     - Combining coefficients from highest power to lowest:\n       \\[\n       2 \\times 7^3 + 1 \\times 7^2 + 6 \\times 7^1 + 0 \\times 7^0 = 2160_7\n       \\]\n  \n- **Verification:**\n  - This matches the base \\(7\\) representation obtained from the direct conversion method.\n  - **Reflection:** Both methods agree, confirming the correctness of the base conversion and the sum of the digits.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Checking the Sum:**\n  - The sum of the digits in \\(2160_7\\) is \\(2 + 1 + 6 + 0 = 9\\).\n  \n- **Overall Approach:**\n  - Starting with direct base conversion provided a clear path, and verifying with powers of \\(7\\) reinforced the accuracy.\n  \n- **Mistakes and Adjustments:**\n  - Initially, I considered using modulo operations but decided to stick with direct conversion for clarity.\n  - No significant errors were encountered, but reflecting and verifying at each step ensured confidence in the result.\n\n- **Final Answer:**\n  - The sum of the digits of the base \\(7\\) representation of \\(777_{10}\\) is **9**.\n\n---\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, meticulously checking each step, and reflecting on the correctness throughout, I ensured a comprehensive and accurate solution to the problem.",

  "ground_truth": "To find the base $7$ representation of $777_{10}$, we first write $777$ as the sum of powers of $7$. To begin, we find that the largest power of $7$ that is less than $777$ is $7^3 = 343$. The largest multiple of $343$ that is less than $777$ is $2 \\cdot 343 = 686$, so we have $777 = 2 \\cdot 343 + 91$. We then consider the remainder $91$. The largest power of $7$ that is less than $91$ is $7^2 = 49$ and the largest multiple of $49$ that is less than $91$ is $1 \\cdot 49 = 49$. This leaves us with $91 - 49 = 42$, which can be expressed as $6 \\cdot 7^1$. Thus, we have $$777 = 2 \\cdot 7^3 + 1 \\cdot 7^2 + 6 \\cdot 7^1 + 0 \\cdot 7^0.$$Our base $7$ representation of $777_{10}$ is then $2160_7$. The sum of the digits of this number is $2 + 1 + 6 + 0 = \\boxed{9}$."
