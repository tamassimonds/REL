    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, emulating a human thought process complete with brainstorming, reflection, and checking along the way. The goal is to explore different strategies, recognize when something isn't working, and adjust our approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**User Query:**  \nFor \\( y = \\frac{1 - x}{2x + 3} \\) and \\( x \\neq -\\frac{3}{2} \\), what is the value of \\( y \\) that is not attainable? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nHmm, this looks like a rational function. Rational functions often have horizontal asymptotes where certain \\( y \\) values are never reached. I remember dealing with asymptotes before, so maybe that's related here. But then again, the question asks for a specific unattainable \\( y \\) value, which makes me think there might be a deeper relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that I need to explore.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Identify Horizontal Asymptotes:** Determine if there's a \\( y \\) value that the function approaches but never actually reaches.\n   \n2. **Solve for \\( x \\) in Terms of \\( y \\):** Rearrange the equation to see if there's a constraint on \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Check for Vertical Asymptotes or Holes:** Although not directly asked, understanding where the function might be undefined could help.\n\n4. **Graphical Approach:** Visualizing the function could provide insights, but I'll try to solve it algebraically first.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nI think starting with identifying horizontal asymptotes makes sense because it's a common way to find unattainable \\( y \\) values in rational functions. If that doesn't work, I'll consider solving for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\). Graphing could be a fallback if the algebra gets tricky.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Horizontal Asymptotes**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's see if there's a horizontal asymptote by analyzing the behavior of \\( y \\) as \\( x \\) approaches infinity or negative infinity. I recall that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote can often be found by comparing the degrees of the numerator and denominator.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Degree Analysis:**\n  - Numerator: \\( 1 - x \\) \u2192 Degree 1 (since the highest exponent of \\( x \\) is 1)\n  - Denominator: \\( 2x + 3 \\) \u2192 Degree 1\n\n- **Rule for Horizontal Asymptotes:**\n  - If the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote is at the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\n- **Leading Coefficients:**\n  - Numerator: Coefficient of \\( -x \\) is \\(-1\\)\n  - Denominator: Coefficient of \\( 2x \\) is \\(2\\)\n\n- **Horizontal Asymptote:**\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{-1}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, so as \\( x \\) approaches infinity or negative infinity, \\( y \\) approaches \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\). But does that mean \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) is unattainable? I'm not sure yet, so let's proceed to verify this with another method.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes the function ever actually reach \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\)? I need to see if there's a value of \\( x \\) that makes \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting to Solve for \\( x \\) in Terms of \\( y \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nPerhaps I can set \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) and solve for \\( x \\) to see if it's possible to attain that \\( y \\) value. If I find an \\( x \\) that works, then \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) is attainable, and I need to reconsider my approach.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Set \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\):**\n  \\[\n  -\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1 - x}{2x + 3}\n  \\]\n\n- **Cross Multiply to Eliminate the Fraction:**\n  \\[\n  -\\frac{1}{2} (2x + 3) = 1 - x\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -x - \\frac{3}{2} = 1 - x\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplify the Equation:**\n  \\[\n  -x - \\frac{3}{2} + x = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -\\frac{3}{2} = 1\n  \\]\n\n- **Result:**\n  \\[\n  -\\frac{3}{2} = 1 \\quad (\\text{Contradiction})\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOh, I see. This leads to a contradiction: \\(-\\frac{3}{2} = 1\\) is impossible. This suggests that \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) cannot be attained by any real \\( x \\) in the given function.\n\n**Check:**  \nSince there's no \\( x \\) that satisfies this equation, \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) is indeed unattainable. This aligns with my initial hypothesis about the horizontal asymptote.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Unattainable Value**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo ensure that \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) is truly unattainable, let's double-check by plugging in various \\( x \\) values to see how close \\( y \\) gets to \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\), but never actually reaches it.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Test \\( x = 0 \\):**\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{1 - 0}{2(0) + 3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.33\n  \\]\n  \n- **Test \\( x = 1 \\):**\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{1 - 1}{2(1) + 3} = \\frac{0}{5} = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Test \\( x = -1 \\):**\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{1 - (-1)}{2(-1) + 3} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Test \\( x = -2 \\):**\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{1 - (-2)}{2(-2) + 3} = \\frac{3}{-1} = -3\n  \\]\n  \n**Pattern Observed:**  \nAs \\( x \\) varies, \\( y \\) moves up and down, approaching \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) but never reaching it.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis supports the idea that \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) is an asymptote, and thus, an unattainable value. The function gets close to \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) but never crosses it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore concluding, let's ensure that no other \\( y \\) values are inherently unattainable. Does the function allow \\( y \\) to take on all other real numbers except \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\)?\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **General Analysis:**\n  - The function \\( y = \\frac{1 - x}{2x + 3} \\) is a rational function.\n  - Rational functions can generally take on all real values except for horizontal asymptotes.\n\n- **Conclusion:**\n  - Since \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) is the only horizontal asymptote identified, it is the only unattainable value for \\( y \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The only \\( y \\) value that cannot be attained is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n1. **Brainstorming:**  \n   - Started by considering horizontal asymptotes as potential unattainable \\( y \\) values.\n\n2. **Exploring Strategies:**  \n   - Attempted to identify the horizontal asymptote and verify its unattainability by solving for \\( x \\) when \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Checking and Reflecting:**  \n   - Upon finding a contradiction when solving for \\( x \\), confirmed that \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) is indeed unattainable.\n   - Tested multiple \\( x \\) values to observe the behavior of \\( y \\), reinforcing the conclusion.\n\n4. **Final Verification:**  \n   - Ensured no other \\( y \\) values are unattainable by analyzing the rational function's properties.\n\nThrough this step-by-step approach, I was able to arrive confidently at the unattainable value of \\( y \\) as \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).",
