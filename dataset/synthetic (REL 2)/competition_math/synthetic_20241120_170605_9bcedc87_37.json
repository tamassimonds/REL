    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming how to approach it, explore different strategies, and reflect frequently to ensure I'm on the right path. Let's mimic a human thought process, complete with explorations, doubts, and \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**Find the point where the line passing through \\((3,4,1)\\) and \\((5,1,6)\\) intersects the \\(xy\\)-plane.**\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with a line in 3D space, defined by two points. The goal is to find where this line intersects the \\(xy\\)-plane.\n\n**Initial thoughts:**\n\n- **3D Geometry:** This reminds me of problems involving lines and planes in three-dimensional space. \n- **Parametric Equations:** Maybe expressing the line in parametric form could help.\n- **Plane Equation:** Alternatively, knowing the equation of the \\(xy\\)-plane (\\(z = 0\\)) might be useful.\n- **Intersection Point:** I need to find the point where \\(z = 0\\) on the line.\n\nDoes any of this seem familiar or relevant? Parametric equations seem like a solid starting point because they allow us to express the line and then see where it intersects the \\(xy\\)-plane.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Parametric Equations of the Line:**\n   - Convert the given points into parametric equations.\n   \n2. **Vector Equation Approach:**\n   - Use vectors to define the line and find the intersection with the \\(xy\\)-plane.\n\n3. **Direct Calculation:**\n   - Calculate the slope and intercepts to find the intersection.\n\n**Wait**, before proceeding, I recall that using parametric equations is a common method for such problems. Let's try that first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Parametric Equations of the Line**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo express the line passing through two points in 3D, I can use parametric equations. These equations will represent the line in terms of a parameter, often \\(t\\).\n\n**Given Points:**\n\n- Point A: \\((3, 4, 1)\\)\n- Point B: \\((5, 1, 6)\\)\n\n**Formula:**\n\nThe parametric equations for a line between two points can be written as:\n\\[\nx(t) = x_0 + (x_1 - x_0)t\n\\]\n\\[\ny(t) = y_0 + (y_1 - y_0)t\n\\]\n\\[\nz(t) = z_0 + (z_1 - z_0)t\n\\]\nwhere \\((x_0, y_0, z_0)\\) are the coordinates of the first point, \\((x_1, y_1, z_1)\\) are the coordinates of the second point, and \\(t\\) is the parameter.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's plug in the coordinates:\n\n- \\(x(0) = 3\\), \\(y(0) = 4\\), \\(z(0) = 1\\)\n- \\(x(1) = 5\\), \\(y(1) = 1\\), \\(z(1) = 6\\)\n\nSo, the parametric equations become:\n\n\\[\nx(t) = 3 + (5 - 3)t = 3 + 2t\n\\]\n\\[\ny(t) = 4 + (1 - 4)t = 4 - 3t\n\\]\n\\[\nz(t) = 1 + (6 - 1)t = 1 + 5t\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nBefore moving on, does this make sense? Looking at the equations, they should describe a straight line in 3D. The coefficients of \\(t\\) represent the direction vector of the line. Seems reasonable so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the \\(xy\\)-Plane**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to find where this line intersects the \\(xy\\)-plane. The equation of the \\(xy\\)-plane is \\(z = 0\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, so I need to find the value of \\(t\\) where \\(z(t) = 0\\). This will give me the point on the line that lies in the \\(xy\\)-plane.\n\n**Formula:**\n\nSet the \\(z(t)\\) equation to zero:\n\\[\n1 + 5t = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(t\\):**\n\n\\[\n5t = -1\n\\]\n\\[\nt = -\\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this value of \\(t\\) make sense? It\u2019s a negative fraction, which is plausible since the line extends in both directions from the given points.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Find the Corresponding \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have \\(t = -\\frac{1}{5}\\), I need to plug this back into the parametric equations for \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) to find the coordinates of the intersection point.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nx\\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 3 + 2\\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 3 - \\frac{2}{5} = 3 - 0.4 = 2.6\n\\]\n\\[\ny\\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 4 - 3\\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 4 + \\frac{3}{5} = 4 + 0.6 = 4.6\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me quickly verify these calculations:\n\n- \\(x\\): \\(3 - 0.4 = 2.6\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(y\\): \\(4 + 0.6 = 4.6\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth calculations seem correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Resulting Intersection Point**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI now have the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates where the line intersects the \\(xy\\)-plane. The \\(z\\) coordinate should be \\(0\\) by definition of the plane.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, the intersection point is \\((2.6, 4.6, 0)\\). This makes sense because we've set \\(z = 0\\) to find the intersection.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this point lie on the line defined by points A and B? Let's quickly verify by plugging \\(t = -\\frac{1}{5}\\) back into the parametric equations:\n\n- \\(x(-\\frac{1}{5}) = 2.6\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(y(-\\frac{1}{5}) = 4.6\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(z(-\\frac{1}{5}) = 0\\) (as expected, since we're in the \\(xy\\)-plane) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Vector Equation of the Line**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nJust to ensure the accuracy of our solution, let's explore another method: using the vector equation of the line and the equation of the \\(xy\\)-plane.\n\n**Given:**\n\n- Line passing through \\((3, 4, 1)\\) and \\((5, 1, 6)\\).\n- \\(xy\\)-plane: \\(z = 0\\).\n\n**Vector Equation of the Line:**\n\nA line can be represented as:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r}_0 + t\\mathbf{d}\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) is a position vector to a point on the line.\n- \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) is the direction vector of the line.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Find the Direction Vector \\(\\mathbf{d}\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{d} = (5 - 3, 1 - 4, 6 - 1) = (2, -3, 5)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choose \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\):**\n\n   Let's take \\((3, 4, 1)\\) as \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\).\n\n3. **Write the Vector Equation:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{r}(t) = (3, 4, 1) + t(2, -3, 5) = (3 + 2t, 4 - 3t, 1 + 5t)\n   \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, this gives us the same parametric equations as before:\n\n\\[\nx(t) = 3 + 2t,\\quad y(t) = 4 - 3t,\\quad z(t) = 1 + 5t\n\\]\n\nSo, it aligns with our previous method. This reassures me that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Using Two-Point Form of a Line**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAnother way to express the line is using its two-point form. This involves finding a linear combination of the vectors representing the points.\n\n**Formula:**\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r}_1 + t(\\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1)\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Define the Points:**\n   - \\(\\mathbf{r}_1 = (3, 4, 1)\\)\n   - \\(\\mathbf{r}_2 = (5, 1, 6)\\)\n\n2. **Compute \\(\\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{d} = (5 - 3, 1 - 4, 6 - 1) = (2, -3, 5)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express the Line:**\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{r}(t) = (3, 4, 1) + t(2, -3, 5) = (3 + 2t, 4 - 3t, 1 + 5t)\n   \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nAgain, we arrive at the same parametric equations. This consistency is a good sign.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying calculations, I'm confident that the point of intersection is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(2.6, 4.6, 0)}\n\\]\n\n**Summary:**\n\n1. **Parametric Equations:** Expressed the line using parametric equations based on the given points.\n2. **Intersection with \\(xy\\)-Plane:** Solved for \\(t\\) where \\(z(t) = 0\\).\n3. **Coordinates Calculation:** Found the corresponding \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates.\n4. **Verification:** Checked the result using an alternative approach to ensure consistency.\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected on each step, verified calculations, and sought alternative methods to confirm the solution's accuracy. This approach mimics human problem-solving, complete with checks, corrections, and validations.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed step-by-step exploration helps in understanding how to tackle such problems!\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's dive back into the problem, brainstorm various strategies, and integrate the correct solution into my thinking process. I'll approach this as naturally as possible, reflecting and checking my work along the way to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Recap of the Previous Attempt**\n\nIn my initial response, I aimed to find the point where the line passing through \\((3,4,1)\\) and \\((5,1,6)\\) intersects the \\(xy\\)-plane. I expressed the line using parametric equations, solved for the parameter \\(t\\) where \\(z(t) = 0\\), and concluded that the intersection point was \\((2.6, 4.6, 0)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a moment\u2014after receiving feedback, I realize that this solution doesn't align with the sample solution provided. The sample solution indicates that the correct intersection point is \\(\\left( \\frac{13}{5}, \\frac{23}{5}, 0 \\right)\\), which simplifies to \\((2.6, 4.6, 0)\\). This means my numerical answer is correct, but the sample solution expresses the coordinates as fractions. This suggests that while my final numerical result is accurate, presenting it in fractional form might be more precise and aligned with typical mathematical conventions.\n\n**Possible Issue:**\n\nBy providing the answer in decimal form \\((2.6, 4.6, 0)\\), I might have overlooked the convention of expressing exact values as fractions when possible. This can be important in mathematical solutions to maintain precision and prevent rounding errors.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n\n- **Re-evaluate the Solution:** Verify each step to ensure that the process leading to the numerical answer is correct.\n- **Integrate Fractional Representation:** Convert the decimal values into fractional form to match the sample solution's format.\n- **Cross-check with Multiple Solutions:** Use different methods to confirm the correctness of the intersection point.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Parametric Equations of the Line:**  \n   Continue using the parametric approach, ensuring that the final answer is presented in fractional form.\n\n2. **Vector Equation Approach:**  \n   Re-examine the vector representation of the line to see if it aligns with the sample solution.\n\n3. **Two-Point Form of a Line:**  \n   Utilize the two-point form to express the line and determine the intersection point with the \\(xy\\)-plane.\n\n**Wait**, before proceeding, I recall that using parametric equations is a common method for such problems. Let's try that again, but this time ensure that the final answer is presented in fractional form.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Parametric Equations of the Line**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo express the line passing through two points in 3D, I can use parametric equations.

Looking at the equations, they should describe a straight line in 3D. The coefficients of \\(t\\) represent the direction vector of the line. Seems reasonable so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the \\(xy\\)-Plane**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to find where this line intersects the \\(xy\\)-plane.

This will give me the point on the line that lies in the \\(xy\\)-plane.\n\n**Formula:**\n\nSet the \\(z(t)\\) equation to zero:\n\\[\n1 + 5t = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(t\\):**\n\n\\[\n5t = -1\n\\]\n\\[\nt = -\\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this value of \\(t\\) make sense? It\u2019s a negative fraction, which is plausible since the line extends in both directions from the given points.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Find the Corresponding \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have \\(t = -\\frac{1}{5}\\), I need to plug this back into the parametric equations for \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) to find the coordinates of the intersection point.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nx\\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 3 + 2\\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 3 - \\frac{2}{5} = 3 - 0.4 = \\frac{13}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\ny\\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 4 - 3\\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 4 + \\frac{3}{5} = 4 + 0.6 = \\frac{23}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me quickly verify these calculations:\n\n- \\(x\\): \\(3 - 0.4 = \\frac{13}{5}\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(y\\): \\(4 + 0.6 = \\frac{23}{5}\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth calculations seem correct, and presenting the answer in fractional form aligns with the sample solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Resulting Intersection Point**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI now have the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates where the line intersects the \\(xy\\)-plane.

This makes sense because we've set \\(z = 0\\) to find the intersection.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this point lie on the line defined by points A and B? Let's quickly verify by plugging \\(t = -\\frac{1}{5}\\) back into the parametric equations:\n\n- \\(x(-\\frac{1}{5}) = \\frac{13}{5}\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(y(-\\frac{1}{5}) = \\frac{23}{5}\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(z(-\\frac{1}{5}) = 0\\) (as expected, since we're in the \\(xy\\)-plane) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Vector Equation of the Line**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nJust to ensure the accuracy of our solution, let's explore another method: using the vector equation of the line and the equation of the \\(xy\\)-plane.\n\n**Given:**\n\n- Line passing through \\((3, 4, 1)\\) and \\((5, 1, 6)\\).\n- \\(xy\\)-plane: \\(z = 0\\).\n\n**Vector Equation of the Line:**\n\nA line can be represented as:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r}_0 + t\\mathbf{d}\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) is a position vector to a point on the line.\n- \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) is the direction vector of the line.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Find the Direction Vector \\(\\mathbf{d}\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{d} = (5 - 3, 1 - 4, 6 - 1) = (2, -3, 5)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choose \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\):**\n\n   Let's take \\((3, 4, 1)\\) as \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\).\n\n3. **Write the Vector Equation:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{r}(t) = (3, 4, 1) + t(2, -3, 5) = (3 + 2t, 4 - 3t, 1 + 5t)\n   \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, this gives us the same parametric equations as before:\n\n\\[\nx(t) = 3 + 2t,\\quad y(t) = 4 - 3t,\\quad z(t) = 1 + 5t\n\\]\n\nSo, it aligns with our previous method.
