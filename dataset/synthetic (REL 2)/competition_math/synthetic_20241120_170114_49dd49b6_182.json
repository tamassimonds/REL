We're dealing with a triangle defined by its vertices at specific coordinates: (2,2), (5,6), and (6,2). The goal is to find the length of the longest side of this triangle.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- This reminds me of problems where I need to calculate distances between points in a coordinate plane.\n- I recall the distance formula being useful here, which is similar to calculating the hypotenuse in a right triangle.\n- Another approach could be to visualize the triangle and perhaps use properties of triangles, but since we\u2019re given coordinates, that might not be necessary.\n- Maybe I should list out the lengths of all sides and then compare them to find the longest.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n1. **Use the Distance Formula:** Calculate the lengths of all three sides using the distance formula between each pair of vertices.\n2. **Graphing:** Plot the points on a graph to visually inspect which side might be the longest.\n3. **Check for Right Angles:** See if any angles are right angles, which might simplify calculations using Pythagorean theorem.\n4. **Reflection:** Wait a minute, I could also check for congruent sides, but with coordinates given, the distance formula seems more straightforward.\n\n**Reflection After Brainstorming:**\n- **Distance Formula** seems the most direct and reliable method here.\n- **Graphing** could help confirm findings but might not be necessary for just calculating side lengths.\n- **Checking for Right Angles** might not directly help unless it simplifies the process, which doesn't seem immediately applicable.\n\n**Decision:** Let's go with the **Distance Formula** to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Lengths of All Sides**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find the longest side, I need to calculate the lengths of all three sides of the triangle.\n- I'll use the distance formula between each pair of vertices.\n\n**Distance Formula Recall:**\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Side AB:** Between points A (2,2) and B (5,6)\n   \\[\n   d_{AB} = \\sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Side BC:** Between points B (5,6) and C (6,2)\n   \\[\n   d_{BC} = \\sqrt{(6 - 5)^2 + (2 - 6)^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 16} = \\sqrt{17} \\approx 4.12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Side CA:** Between points C (6,2) and A (2,2)\n   \\[\n   d_{CA} = \\sqrt{(2 - 6)^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(-4)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{16} = 4\n   \\]\n\n**Natural Check:**\n- Okay, so the lengths are:\n  - Side AB: 5\n  - Side BC: approximately 4.12\n  - Side CA: 4\n\n- **Quick Reflection:** Does this make sense? The side lengths are all positive, and AB being 5 feels like it could be the longest. BC is around 4.12, which seems plausible, and CA is 4. Lower than 4.12, so AB might indeed be the longest.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Longest Side**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now that I have the lengths of all sides, it's straightforward to identify the longest one by comparing these values.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Compare:\n  - AB = 5\n  - BC \u2248 4.12\n  - CA = 4\n\n- **Longest Side:** Clearly, AB = 5 is the longest.\n\n**Natural Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** Does AB being 5 seem reasonable? Yes, 5 is larger than 4.12 and 4.\n- **Deeper Reflection:** Given the calculations, AB is definitively the longest side. No need for further checks.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- It's always good to verify if the calculations align with expectations.\n- Perhaps re-check the distance calculations to ensure there are no mistakes.\n\n**Re-checking Calculations:**\n\n1. **Side AB:**\n   \\[\n   d_{AB} = \\sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n   \\]\n   - **Confirmation:** Correct.\n\n2. **Side BC:**\n   \\[\n   d_{BC} = \\sqrt{(6 - 5)^2 + (2 - 6)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 16} = \\sqrt{17} \\approx 4.12\n   \\]\n   - **Confirmation:** Correct.\n\n3. **Side CA:**\n   \\[\n   d_{CA} = \\sqrt{(2 - 6)^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{16} = 4\n   \\]\n   - **Confirmation:** Correct.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- All side lengths were calculated correctly.\n- The longest side is indeed AB with a length of 5 units.\n- No inconsistencies or errors found.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter systematically calculating the lengths of all sides of the triangle using the distance formula and verifying each step, it's clear that the longest side is **5 units**. This approach ensured accuracy by adhering to a well-known mathematical formula and checking the work along the way.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe number of units in the length of the longest side of the triangle is **5**.",
