The first thing that strikes me is that we're dealing with a quadratic equation in the form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\). I remember from my studies that the graph of such an equation is a parabola. \n\n**Key Given Information:**\n1. The vertex of the parabola is at \\( (5, 3) \\).\n2. The parabola has a vertical axis of symmetry.\n3. The parabola passes through the point \\( (2, 0) \\).\n\nWhen I see the vertex given, I recall that the vertex form of a parabola is really useful. Vertex form is:\n\\[\ny = a(x - h)^2 + k\n\\]\nwhere \\( (h, k) \\) is the vertex. This seems like a good starting point since I know the vertex is \\( (5, 3) \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- **Option 1:** Use the vertex form to write the equation directly.\n- **Option 2:** Since I have another point \\( (2, 0) \\) that lies on the parabola, I can substitute this into the vertex form to find \\( a \\).\n- **Option 3:** After finding \\( a \\), convert the vertex form to standard form to identify \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n- **Option 4:** Alternatively, if I chose to start with the standard form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), I would need to set up a system of equations using both the vertex and the given point. This feels a bit cumbersome compared to starting with the vertex form.\n\nGiven these options, starting with the vertex form seems more straightforward. But let's explore a bit more to ensure this is the best path.\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies:**\n1. **Using Vertex Form:** As mentioned, this uses the vertex directly, making it straightforward.\n2. **Standard Form Approach:** Set up equations based on the vertex and the additional point, but this requires solving a system.\n3. **Leverage Symmetry:** Since there's a vertical axis of symmetry at \\( x = 5 \\), the vertex's x-coordinate is vital, which aligns well with using vertex form.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Vertex Form Seems Optimal:** Because it directly incorporates the vertex, reducing the number of unknowns early on.\n- **Standard Form Would Work Too:** But it feels more involved and might lead to unnecessary complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Using Vertex Form to Write the Equation\n\nLet's go ahead and write the equation using the vertex form.\n\n\\[\ny = a(x - 5)^2 + 3\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I\u2019m substituting \\( h = 5 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\) from the vertex \\( (5, 3) \\).\n- The only unknown now is \\( a \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Checking:** This looks correct because I've directly applied the vertex information.\n- **Next Step:** I need to find \\( a \\), which I can do by using the point \\( (2, 0) \\) that lies on the parabola.\n\n### Step 2: Substituting the Point \\( (2, 0) \\) to Find \\( a \\)\n\nNow, I'll substitute \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\) into the equation to solve for \\( a \\).\n\n\\[\n0 = a(2 - 5)^2 + 3\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = a(3)^2 + 3\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = 9a + 3\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n9a + 3 = 0 \\implies 9a = -3 \\implies a = -\\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Substitution:** Plugging in the coordinates of the given point to solve for \\( a \\).\n- **Solving for \\( a \\):** Simple algebra leads me to \\( a = -\\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Checking the Calculation:** \n  - \\( 9a = -3 \\) simplifies correctly to \\( a = -\\frac{1}{3} \\).\n  - This makes sense; a negative \\( a \\) indicates the parabola opens downwards, which aligns with the vertex being at \\( (5, 3) \\).\n\n### Step 3: Writing the Equation with Known Coefficients\n\nNow that I have \\( a = -\\frac{1}{3} \\), I'll substitute it back into the vertex form equation.\n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{3}(x - 5)^2 + 3\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Finalizing Vertex Form:** This now fully represents the parabola with the known vertex and the correct orientation.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Seems Correct:** The equation now includes all necessary parameters. \n\n### Step 4: Converting to Standard Form to Identify \\( b \\) and \\( c \\)\n\nI need to find \\( b \\) and \\( c \\), so let's expand the vertex form to standard form.\n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{3}(x - 5)^2 + 3\n\\]\n\n**Expanding the Squared Term:**\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 = x^2 - 10x + 25\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{3}(x^2 - 10x + 25) + 3\n\\]\n\n**Distributing \\( -\\frac{1}{3} \\):**\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{3}x^2 + \\frac{10}{3}x - \\frac{25}{3} + 3\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{3}x^2 + \\frac{10}{3}x - \\frac{25}{3} + \\frac{9}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{3}x^2 + \\frac{10}{3}x - \\frac{16}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Expanding Carefully:** Ensuring each step, especially distributing the negative fraction, is done correctly.\n- **Combining Constant Terms:** Simplifying \\( -\\frac{25}{3} + \\frac{9}{3} \\) to get \\( -\\frac{16}{3} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Checking Steps:**\n  - \\( (x - 5)^2 \\) expanded correctly.\n  - Distribution of \\( -\\frac{1}{3} \\) is accurate.\n  - Constants combined correctly.\n  \n- **Final Equation:** \n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{1}{3}x^2 + \\frac{10}{3}x - \\frac{16}{3}\n  \\]\n  \n### Step 5: Identifying \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\)\n\nNow, comparing this equation to the standard form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), I can directly identify:\n\n- \\( a = -\\frac{1}{3} \\)\n- \\( b = \\frac{10}{3} \\)\n- \\( c = -\\frac{16}{3} \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Direct Comparison:** Simply align coefficients from both forms to extract \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Seems Correct:** Each coefficient corresponds correctly to the standard form.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating \\( a + b + c \\)\n\nFinally, let's find \\( a + b + c \\):\n\n\\[\na + b + c = -\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{16}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n= \\left(-\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{16}{3}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\left(-\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{10}{3} - \\frac{16}{3}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\left(\\frac{9}{3} - \\frac{16}{3}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= -\\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Adding Fractions:** Ensuring the signs are handled correctly when combining \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Final Check:** \n  - Adding \\( -\\frac{1}{3} \\) and \\( \\frac{10}{3} \\) gives \\( \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\).\n  - Subtracting \\( \\frac{16}{3} \\) from \\( 3 \\) results in \\( -\\frac{7}{3} \\).\n  \n- **Answer:** \n  \\[\n  a + b + c = -\\frac{7}{3}\n  \\]\n  \n### Step 7: Verifying the Approach\n\nBefore finalizing, let's reflect on the entire process to ensure everything aligns correctly.\n\n**Checkpoints:**\n- **Using Vertex Form:** Started with the most relevant form, given the vertex was provided.\n- **Correctly Solving for \\( a \\):** Used the given point to find \\( a \\), ensuring it makes sense with the vertex.\n- **Expanding to Standard Form:** Converted vertex form to standard form accurately to identify all coefficients.\n- **Calculating \\( a + b + c \\):** Combined coefficients correctly, ensuring fractions were handled properly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does Everything Check Out?**\n  - Yes, each step logically follows the previous one.\n  - Calculations are consistent and align with the given information.\n  - The final answer makes sense given the problem's constraints.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully exploring different strategies, selecting the most straightforward approach, and meticulously checking each step along the way, I confidently conclude that:\n\n\\[\na + b + c = -\\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\nThis structured, reflective, and step-by-step method ensures accuracy and aligns with natural human problem-solving, continuously checking and adjusting the approach as needed.",
