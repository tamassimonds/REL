    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my approach, and make sure to check my work along the way, just like I would if I were solving it naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first glance at the problem:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\cot A - \\csc A)(1 + \\tan A + \\sec A)\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Familiar Functions:** I see trigonometric identities like \\(\\cot A\\), \\(\\csc A\\), \\(\\tan A\\), and \\(\\sec A\\). This reminds me of simplifying expressions using basic trigonometric identities.\n  \n- **Multiplication of Binomials:** The structure looks similar to multiplying two binomials, like \\((x + y)(x + z)\\). Maybe expanding it could work here?\n  \n- **Combining Terms:** Alternatively, perhaps combining all terms into a single fraction might simplify things before expanding.\n\nAt this point, I'm unsure which method will be the most efficient, so I'll brainstorm a bit to see what's possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Expand Using Distributive Property:**\n   - Treat it like multiplying two binomials.\n   - Expand \\((1 + \\cot A - \\csc A)\\) with each term in \\((1 + \\tan A + \\sec A)\\).\n\n2. **Simplify Using Trigonometric Identities:**\n   - Replace \\(\\cot A\\), \\(\\csc A\\), \\(\\tan A\\), and \\(\\sec A\\) with their definitions in terms of \\(\\sin A\\) and \\(\\cos A\\).\n   - See if simplification leads to a more straightforward expression.\n\n3. **Combine into a Single Fraction:**\n   - Attempt to write everything as a single fraction to see if terms cancel out.\n\n4. **Use Pythagorean Identities:**\n   - Perhaps applying identities like \\(\\sin^2 A + \\cos^2 A = 1\\) could help simplify the expression.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Timing Concern:** Expanding might take a while, and checking if it simplifies nicely could be tricky. However, combining terms into a single fraction might lead to easier cancellations.\n  \n- **Trigonometric Identities:** Using identities could provide a clearer path, especially if it simplifies down to basic functions.\n\nGiven these options, **I think starting with simplifying using trigonometric identities** might be the most straightforward approach. If that doesn't work, I can try expanding or combining into a single fraction.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify Using Trigonometric Identities**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s replace the trigonometric functions with their definitions to see if things simplify:\n\n- \\(\\cot A = \\frac{\\cos A}{\\sin A}\\)\n- \\(\\csc A = \\frac{1}{\\sin A}\\)\n- \\(\\tan A = \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A}\\)\n- \\(\\sec A = \\frac{1}{\\cos A}\\)\n\n**Applying to the Expression:**\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\frac{\\cos A}{\\sin A} - \\frac{1}{\\sin A})(1 + \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} + \\frac{1}{\\cos A})\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Each Binomial:**\n\nFirst Binomial: \n\\[\n1 + \\frac{\\cos A}{\\sin A} - \\frac{1}{\\sin A} = 1 + \\frac{\\cos A - 1}{\\sin A}\n\\]\n\nSecond Binomial:\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} + \\frac{1}{\\cos A} = 1 + \\frac{\\sin A + 1}{\\cos A}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks like it's moving towards simplifying the fractions, but maybe combining terms into a single fraction could be a better next step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Combine into a Single Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore proceeding, let's see if combining these expressions into a single fraction helps. It might make cancellation easier.\n\n**Combining First Binomial:**\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{\\cos A - 1}{\\sin A} = \\frac{\\sin A + (\\cos A - 1)}{\\sin A} = \\frac{\\sin A + \\cos A - 1}{\\sin A}\n\\]\n\n**Combining Second Binomial:**\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{\\sin A + 1}{\\cos A} = \\frac{\\cos A + (\\sin A + 1)}{\\cos A} = \\frac{\\cos A + \\sin A + 1}{\\cos A}\n\\]\n\n**Rewriting the Original Expression:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{\\sin A + \\cos A - 1}{\\sin A}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\cos A + \\sin A + 1}{\\cos A}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks cleaner, and it seems like we're set up for cancellation. But before proceeding, let's **check if this approach is correct.** \n\n- **Verification:** Does combining into a single fraction simplify the multiplication? Yes, because now the numerator and denominator can potentially cancel out terms.\n\n**Checking for Errors:**\n\n- **Mistake Possibility:** Did I incorrectly combine or simplify any terms? No, the combinations seem accurate.\n\nAt this point, **it seems like a valid approach.** Let's move forward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Multiply the Combined Fractions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWhen multiplying fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. Let's apply that here.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(\\sin A + \\cos A - 1)(\\cos A + \\sin A + 1)}{\\sin A \\cdot \\cos A}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Numerator:**\n\nThis looks like a product of two binomials. Let's expand:\n\n\\[\n(\\sin A + \\cos A - 1)(\\cos A + \\sin A + 1) \n\\]\n\nUsing the distributive property:\n\n1. **First Term:** \n   \\[\n   \\sin A \\cdot \\cos A + \\sin A \\cdot \\sin A + \\sin A \\cdot 1 = \\sin A \\cos A + \\sin^2 A + \\sin A\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n   \\[\n   \\cos A \\cdot \\cos A + \\cos A \\cdot \\sin A + \\cos A \\cdot 1 = \\cos^2 A + \\cos A \\sin A + \\cos A\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n   \\[\n   -1 \\cdot \\cos A + -1 \\cdot \\sin A + -1 \\cdot 1 = -\\cos A - \\sin A - 1\n   \\]\n\n**Adding Them Up:**\n\n\\[\n(\\sin A \\cos A + \\sin^2 A + \\sin A) + (\\cos^2 A + \\cos A \\sin A + \\cos A) + (-\\cos A - \\sin A - 1)\n\\]\n\n**Combining Like Terms:**\n\n- **\\(\\sin^2 A + \\cos^2 A = 1\\) (Pythagorean Identity)**\n- **\\(\\sin A \\cos A + \\cos A \\sin A = 2 \\sin A \\cos A\\)**\n- **\\(-\\cos A + \\cos A = 0\\)**\n- **\\(-\\sin A + \\sin A = 0\\)**\n- **Constants: \\(1 - 1 = 0\\)**\n\nSo, the numerator simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2 \\sin A \\cos A\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that seems promising because \\(2 \\sin A \\cos A\\) is a double angle identity for \\(\\sin 2A\\). But let me double-check to ensure there are no mistakes.\n\n**Checking for Errors:**\n\n- **Did I miss any terms?** No, all terms were accounted for.\n- **Is \\(\\sin^2 A + \\cos^2 A = 1\\) correctly applied?** Yes.\n\nSince everything checks out, **this part is correct.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Rewrite the Expression with Simplified Numerator**\n\n**Expression Now:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\sin A \\cos A}{\\sin A \\cos A}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAt this stage, **it looks like we can simplify by canceling \\(\\sin A \\cos A\\)** in the numerator and denominator. But before canceling, let's **verify that \\(\\sin A\\) and \\(\\cos A\\) are not zero,** as division by zero is undefined.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Domain Consideration:** For this expression to be valid, \\(\\sin A \\neq 0\\) and \\(\\cos A \\neq 0\\). Assuming we're working in a context where \\(A\\) is not an integer multiple of \\(\\pi\\) (i.e., \\(A \\neq n\\pi\\)), this is fine.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSimplifying by canceling \\(\\sin A \\cos A\\) is safe here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Simplify the Expression**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 \\sin A \\cos A}{\\sin A \\cos A} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n**Wait, that can't be right**, can it? The original expression was quite complex, and simplifying down to just 2 seems too straightforward, especially considering the amount of expansion involved. Let's double-check to ensure the steps were followed correctly.\n\n**Checking:**\n\n- **Did I correctly expand the binomials?** Yes.\n- **Was the Pythagorean identity applied correctly?** Yes.\n- **Were terms accurately combined and simplified?** Yes.\n\n**Moment of Doubt:**\n\nDespite the checks, **the simplicity of the final answer makes me wonder** if there might be a mistake somewhere. But everything seems to align logically, and cancelling \\(\\sin A \\cos A\\) is valid under the given conditions.\n\n**Insight:**\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Perhaps expanding the original expression without simplifying using identities could lead to a different insight, but given that we've reached a consistent and simplified result, it's likely correct.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nEven though the answer is simple, **and it might seem surprising**, the step-by-step approach confirms its correctness. Simplifying trigonometric expressions often leads to unexpected, elegant results.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\cot A - \\csc A)(1 + \\tan A + \\sec A) = 2\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Recap of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:** Started by exploring different methods to tackle the problem, ultimately deciding to use trigonometric identities combined into a single fraction for clarity.\n\n- **Step-by-Step Approach:** Carefully worked through each part, combining and simplifying expressions, verifying each step, and ensuring no errors in expanding and applying identities.\n\n- **Reflection and Checking:** Throughout the process, continually reflected on the correctness of each step, double-checked calculations, and considered domain constraints to validate simplifications.\n\n- **Final Check:** Despite the simplicity of the final answer, multiple checks confirmed its accuracy, leading to a confident conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nAt first, the path seemed uncertain, and the simplicity of the final answer raised questions. However, by methodically applying trigonometric identities and carefully verifying each step, we confidently arrived at the correct solution. This process underscores the importance of reflection and checking in mathematical problem-solving, ensuring that even seemingly straightforward answers are thoroughly validated.",
