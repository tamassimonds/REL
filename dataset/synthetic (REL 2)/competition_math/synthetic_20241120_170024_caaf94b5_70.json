I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and adjust my approach if something doesn't seem right. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**\"How many divisors of 63 are also divisors of 72?\"**\n\nMy initial reaction is confusion. I think, *\"Wait, this involves both 63 and 72. Are we talking about common divisors? But I remember learning about positive and negative divisors too. Let me brainstorm a bit...\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **List All Divisors:**\n   - I could list all positive and negative divisors of both 63 and 72 and see which ones overlap.\n   - *But wait,* listing can be time-consuming and might lead to mistakes.\n\n2. **Use Prime Factorization:**\n   - Maybe using prime factorization would help identify common factors more efficiently.\n   - *That sounds promising,* since prime factorization gives a clear picture of the divisors.\n\n3. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**\n   - Another thought is to find the GCD of 63 and 72, as the divisors of the GCD would also be common divisors.\n   - *This might work well,* but I need to remember that we're looking for both positive and negative divisors.\n\n4. **Set Intersection:**\n   - I could think of it as finding the intersection of the sets of divisors of 63 and 72.\n   - *This is similar to listing,* but maybe more structured.\n\n**Reflecting on these options, I think using prime factorization and then exploring the GCD seems the most efficient. Let's try that.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n*Let me break down both numbers into their prime factors. This should help me understand their divisors better.*\n\n- **Prime Factorization of 63:**\n  - 63 = 3 \u00d7 21\n  - 21 = 3 \u00d7 7\n  - **So,** 63 = \\(3^2 \u00d7 7^1\\)\n\n- **Prime Factorization of 72:**\n  - 72 = 8 \u00d7 9\n  - 8 = \\(2^3\\), 9 = \\(3^2\\)\n  - **So,** 72 = \\(2^3 \u00d7 3^2\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*Okay, so 63 has primes 3 and 7, while 72 has 2 and 3. I see that both have 3 as a common prime factor. That's a good sign.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Common Divisors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n*Since both numbers share the prime factor 3, maybe the common divisors are those that include 3 raised to certain powers. Let's see if that makes sense.*\n\n- **Divisors of 63:** \n  - Based on \\(3^2 \u00d7 7^1\\), the divisors are:\n  - \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b17, \u00b19, \u00b121, \u00b163\n\n- **Divisors of 72:** \n  - Based on \\(2^3 \u00d7 3^2\\), the divisors are:\n  - \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b14, \u00b16, \u00b18, \u00b19, \u00b112, \u00b118, \u00b124, \u00b136, \u00b172\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n*Hmm, listing seems a bit cumbersome here, especially with negatives. But I notice that both lists include \u00b11, \u00b13, and \u00b19. Maybe these are the common ones?*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Revising the Approach**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*Wait, this feels like I'm just picking out common numbers. Maybe there's a more systematic way to find all common divisors without listing everything.*\n\n*Let me think...*\n\n*What if I consider the GCD of 63 and 72? The divisors of the GCD would be the common divisors, right? Let's explore that.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the GCD**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n*Finding the GCD seems efficient. If I can determine the GCD, all its divisors will be common divisors.*\n\n- **GCD Calculation:**\n  - From the prime factorizations:\n    - 63 = \\(3^2 \u00d7 7^1\\)\n    - 72 = \\(2^3 \u00d7 3^2\\)\n  - **Common primes:** Only 3\n  - **Lowest power of common prime:** \\(3^2\\)\n  - **So,** GCD = 9\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*Ahh, so the GCD is 9. That means all divisors of 9 are common divisors of 63 and 72.*\n\n*Let me list the divisors of 9 to see how many there are.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Listing Divisors of the GCD (9)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n*I need both positive and negative divisors of 9.*\n\n- **Divisors of 9:**\n  - Positive: 1, 3, 9\n  - Negative: -1, -3, -9\n\n**Counting Them:**\n\n*There are three positive and three negative divisors, making a total of six common divisors.*\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*Wait, that seems too small. Let me double-check if I've considered all divisors correctly.*\n\n*Oh! I remember now: I only listed divisors up to the square root of 9, but since we're considering both positive and negative, I've counted them all.*\n\n*Hmm, thinking back...* I initially thought there might be more common divisors, but I realize that the GCD encompasses all common factors.\n\n*So, the total number of common divisors is indeed six: \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b19.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Answer**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n*Does it make sense that the common divisors are exactly those of the GCD?*\n\n*I think it does because any divisor common to both 63 and 72 must divide the GCD.*\n\n*Let me recall a similar problem I solved before...* Yes, in that case, the common divisors were precisely the divisors of the GCD.\n\n*So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.*\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Total Number of Common Divisors:** **6**\n\n- \u00b11\n- \u00b13\n- \u00b19\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*By exploring different strategies\u2014listing, prime factorization, and using the GCD\u2014I found that the most efficient method was to calculate the GCD of 63 and 72, which is 9. From there, I identified that all divisors of 9, both positive and negative, are common divisors of 63 and 72.*\n\n*Reflecting throughout the process helped ensure accuracy, and checking each step confirmed that the approach was correct.*\n\n---\n\n*This walkthrough mimics natural human thinking, complete with brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting strategies to arrive at the final solution.*",

  "ground_truth": "First, we list the factors of 63.  They are -63, -21, -9, -7, -3, -1, 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, and 63.  Then, we list the factors of 72.  They are -72, -36, -24, -18, -12, -9, -8, -6, -4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.  By comparing the two lists, we can see that the divisors that 63 and 72 share are -9, -3, -1, 1, 3, and 9.  (Notice that these six numbers are the divisors of 9; is this a coincidence?) Therefore, 63 and 72 share $\\boxed{6}$ divisors."
