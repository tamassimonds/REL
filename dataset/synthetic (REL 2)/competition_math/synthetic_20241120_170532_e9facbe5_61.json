Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at the problem, we have:\n\n- A cubic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) with specific values at \\( P(0) = k \\), \\( P(1) = 2k \\), and \\( P(-1) = 3k \\).\n- We need to find \\( P(2) + P(-2) \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Cubic Polynomial Basics:** I remember that a cubic polynomial has the general form \\( P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\). Since we have multiple points, it seems like we can set up equations based on the given values.\n  \n- **Symmetry Insights:** The problem involves evaluating the polynomial at \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\). Maybe there's some symmetry or properties of odd/even functions that could help.\n\n- **Use of Differences:** Another approach could be to consider finite differences, which is often useful with polynomial interpolation.\n\n- **Lagrange Interpolation:** I recall that Lagrange interpolation can be used to find polynomials that fit given points. However, using it directly might be overkill here.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- At first glance, setting up a system of equations seems straightforward. Let me try that and see where it leads. If it gets too complicated, I'll reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Polynomial**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, I'll write it in its general form:\n\n\\[\nP(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\n\\]\n\nGiven the values:\n\n1. \\( P(0) = k \\)\n2. \\( P(1) = 2k \\)\n3. \\( P(-1) = 3k \\)\n\nI can substitute these into the polynomial to create a system of equations.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **For \\( P(0) = k \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  P(0) = a(0)^3 + b(0)^2 + c(0) + d = d = k\n  \\]\n\n  So, **\\( d = k \\)**.\n\n- **For \\( P(1) = 2k \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  P(1) = a(1)^3 + b(1)^2 + c(1) + d = a + b + c + k = 2k\n  \\]\n\n  Simplifying:\n\n  \\[\n  a + b + c + k = 2k \\implies a + b + c = k \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n  \\]\n\n- **For \\( P(-1) = 3k \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  P(-1) = a(-1)^3 + b(-1)^2 + c(-1) + d = -a + b - c + k = 3k\n  \\]\n\n  Simplifying:\n\n  \\[\n  -a + b - c + k = 3k \\implies -a + b - c = 2k \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n- **Equation 1:** \\( a + b + c = k \\)\n- **Equation 2:** \\( -a + b - c = 2k \\)\n\nThis looks promising. I can solve this system to find values for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), I can add and subtract the equations to eliminate variables.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2:**\n\n  \\[\n  (a + b + c) + (-a + b - c) = k + 2k\n  \\]\n\n  Simplifying:\n\n  \\[\n  2b = 3k \\implies b = \\frac{3k}{2}\n  \\]\n\n  So, **\\( b = \\frac{3k}{2} \\)**.\n\n- **Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:**\n\n  \\[\n  (a + b + c) - (-a + b - c) = k - 2k\n  \\]\n\n  Simplifying:\n\n  \\[\n  2a + 2c = -k \\implies a + c = -\\frac{k}{2} \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow, I've isolated \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) in terms of \\( k \\). So far, so good. Let's see if I can find another relationship to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Another Relationship**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI realize that with cubic polynomials, there might be properties related to symmetry. Specifically, if the polynomial is odd or even, certain terms could cancel out.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nHowever, reflecting on this, I remember that our polynomial has both even and odd terms because we're dealing with both \\( x \\) and \\( -x \\). Since we have no specific information about the polynomial being odd or even, this might not directly apply here.\n\nInstead, I can look for patterns or additional equations involving higher powers of \\( x \\).\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nAnother idea is to consider the polynomial's behavior at \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\), but I don't have direct information. So, perhaps I should continue with my current equations and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a better way. I remember that sometimes with symmetric points, the sum \\( P(2) + P(-2) \\) can be related to the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nGiven that \\( P(x) \\) is cubic, the sum \\( P(2) + P(-2) \\) might involve only even-powered coefficients (since odd powers cancel out). Let me check if this aligns with the general form.\n\n**Checking:**\n\nThe general form is:\n\n\\[\nP(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\n\\]\n\nEvaluating at \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\):\n\n\\[\nP(2) = 8a + 4b + 2c + d\n\\]\n\\[\nP(-2) = -8a + 4b - 2c + d\n\\]\n\nAdding them:\n\n\\[\nP(2) + P(-2) = (8a - 8a) + (4b + 4b) + (2c - 2c) + (d + d) = 8b + 2d\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute! This means \\( P(2) + P(-2) \\) only depends on the coefficients \\( b \\) and \\( d \\). Since we've already determined \\( d = k \\) and \\( b = \\frac{3k}{2} \\), I can now compute \\( P(2) + P(-2) \\) without needing to find \\( a \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis seems like a cleaner path. Let's proceed with this insight.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating \\( P(2) + P(-2) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGiven that \\( P(2) + P(-2) = 8b + 2d \\), and I already know \\( b \\) and \\( d \\) in terms of \\( k \\), I can substitute these values to find the answer.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{3k}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nd = k\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n\\[\nP(2) + P(-2) = 8\\left(\\frac{3k}{2}\\right) + 2k\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n= 12k + 2k = 14k\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, so \\( P(2) + P(-2) = 14k \\). This makes sense given the symmetry properties we explored. Since the odd terms cancel out, only the even terms contribute to the sum.\n\nI think this is the correct answer. However, to be sure, let's briefly reflect:\n\n- The steps followed align with polynomial properties.\n- The relationship derived (\\( P(2) + P(-2) = 8b + 2d \\)) is valid for any cubic polynomial.\n- Substituting known coefficients yields a consistent result.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nDoes it make sense numerically? For instance, if \\( k = 1 \\), then \\( P(2) + P(-2) = 14 \\). This seems reasonable. Moreover, no contradictions arose during the process.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{14k}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nLooking back, starting with setting up a system of equations was a good initial strategy. However, recognizing the symmetry in the polynomial helped streamline the process significantly. By leveraging polynomial properties, I avoided solving for all coefficients individually, making the solution more efficient.\n\nThroughout, checking and reflecting frequently ensured that each step was on the right track, catching potential missteps early. This approach not only led to the correct answer but also highlighted the importance of exploring multiple strategies and being adaptable in problem-solving.",
