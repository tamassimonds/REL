    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see where it takes us. The goal is to find the probability that the product of six rolls of a standard die is odd. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\n\nFirst thoughts:\n- **Product Being Odd:** I remember from earlier problems that for a product to be odd, all factors must be odd. If even one factor is even, the entire product becomes even.\n- **Standard Die:** A standard die has six faces numbered 1 to 6. I know that among these, 1, 3, and 5 are odd, while 2, 4, and 6 are even.\n- **Rolling Six Times:** This adds an element of repetition. Each roll is independent, so the probability calculations will multiply across the six rolls.\n\nInitial Brainstorming:\n- **Probability of Odd Rolls:** Maybe I should start by finding the probability of getting an odd number in a single roll.\n- **All Rolls Independent:** Since each roll is independent, I could multiply the probabilities for each roll.\n- **Complementary Probability:** Alternatively, I could find the probability of getting at least one even number and subtract from 1.\n  \nI'm leaning towards calculating the probability of all rolls being odd because it directly aligns with the question. But I\u2019ll keep the complementary approach in mind as a double-check.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Probability of a Single Roll Being Odd\n\nThought Process:\n- **Total Faces:** There are 6 possible outcomes on a die.\n- **Odd Faces:** 3 out of the 6 faces are odd (1, 3, 5).\n- **Probability Calculation:** So, the probability of rolling an odd number is the number of odd faces divided by the total number of faces.\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Odd in one roll}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of odd faces}}{\\text{Total faces}} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nCheck:\n- That makes sense because half of the die faces are odd.\n\n### Step 3: Extending to Six Rolls\n\nThought Process:\n- **Independent Events:** Since each roll is independent, the probability of all six rolls being odd is the product of the probabilities of each individual roll.\n- **Multiplying Probabilities:** This is similar to flipping a coin multiple times and wanting all flips to land on heads.\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\nP(\\text{All six rolls odd}) = P(\\text{Odd in one roll})^6 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\frac{1}{64}\n\\]\n\nCheck:\n- Wait a second, \\(\\frac{1}{64}\\) seems reasonable because the probability decreases as the number of rolls increases. \n- But let me quickly reflect: rolling a die six times with each having a \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) chance to be odd seems like a straightforward calculation.\n\n### Step 4: Considering the Complementary Probability\n\nThought Process:\n- **Alternative Approach:** To double-check, let's consider the probability of at least one roll being even and subtract it from 1.\n- **Probability of Even Roll:** Similarly, the probability of rolling an even number is \\(\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nCalculation:\n\\[\nP(\\text{At least one even}) = 1 - P(\\text{All six rolls odd}) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = 1 - \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{63}{64}\n\\]\n\nCheck:\n- This approach confirms our earlier calculation. If the probability of at least one roll being even is \\(\\frac{63}{64}\\), then the probability of all rolls being odd is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{64}\\).\n\n### Step 5: Final Reflection and Conclusion\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n- Both methods lead to the same conclusion: the probability that the product of all six rolls is odd is \\(\\frac{1}{64}\\).\n- **Consistency Check:** Using both direct multiplication and the complementary probability approach ensures the accuracy of the result.\n- **Probability Sense Check:** Given that each roll has a \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) chance to be odd, and there are six rolls, \\(\\frac{1}{64}\\) feels proportionate.\n\nConclusion:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}\n\\]\n\n### Additional Reflection:\n\n- **Initial Hesitations:** At first, I considered whether there might be a more intuitive way to approach the problem, like visualizing the die or thinking about similar probability problems.\n- **Mistake Recognition:** There were no significant missteps, but it was important to verify both methods yielded the same result to ensure correctness.\n- **Thought Process Flow:** The brainstorming helped solidify the strategy, and regularly checking each step ensured the calculations were on track.\n\nOverall, tackling the problem step-by-step while reflecting on each part helped navigate through different strategies and arrive confidently at the correct probability.",

  "ground_truth": "The product of all six rolls is odd if and only if each roll is odd.  Any given roll has an odd result with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.  The probability of all six rolls being odd is therefore $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$."
