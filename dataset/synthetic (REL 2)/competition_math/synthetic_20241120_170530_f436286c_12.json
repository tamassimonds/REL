I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like a human would tackle a math problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I think it's about understanding the properties of divisors and possibly using prime factorization. Here's what comes to mind:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:** Break down 150 into its prime factors to understand its divisors better.\n2. **Listing All Divisors:** Generate a complete list of divisors and then filter out those divisible by 5.\n3. **Using the Divisor Function Formula:** Apply a formula that uses prime exponents to calculate the number of divisors.\n4. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** Consider all divisors and subtract those that are divisible by 5.\n\nAt this point, I think prime factorization might be a good starting point because it often simplifies the process of finding divisors. But I'm open to trying different methods if this doesn't work out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting Prime Factorization**\n\nLet's start by finding the prime factorization of 150.\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  I know that prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors. This should help me identify all the building blocks of 150.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  Let's divide 150 by the smallest prime number:\n  \\[\n  150 \\div 2 = 75  \n  \\]\n  So, 2 is a prime factor.\n\n  Now, factor 75:\n  \\[\n  75 \\div 3 = 25  \n  \\]\n  Here, 3 is another prime factor.\n\n  Finally, factor 25:\n  \\[\n  25 \\div 5 = 5  \n  \\]\n  And 5 is also a prime factor.\n\n  Thus, the prime factorization of 150 is:\n  \\[\n  150 = 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2  \n  \\]\n\n- **Check:**  \n  Multiplying the factors back:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 3 = 6; \\quad 6 \\times 5^2 = 6 \\times 25 = 150  \n  \\]\n  This matches the original number, so the factorization seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Understanding the Role of Each Prime Factor**\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Since the problem asks for divisors not divisible by 5, I need to carefully consider how the prime factorization helps in identifying such divisors.\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Divisors of 150 are formed by multiplying its prime factors raised to their respective powers. To find divisors not divisible by 5, I should look at combinations of factors excluding 5.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Generating All Divisors Using Prime Exponents**\n\n- **Approach:**  \n  Use the exponents in the prime factorization to determine all possible combinations that yield divisors.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  Each exponent can range from 0 up to its maximum in the factorization:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Exponents: }  \n  2^0 \\text{ or } 2^1, \\  \n  3^0 \\text{ or } 3^1, \\  \n  5^0, 5^1, \\text{ or } 5^2  \n  \\]\n  \n  Total combinations:\n  \\[\n  (1 + 1) \\times (1 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 12  \n  \\]\n  \n  So, there are 12 divisors in total.\n\n- **Check:**  \n  Wait, let me think. Did I count all possible combinations correctly? Each prime factor's exponent contributes to the number of divisors, so 1 more than its maximum exponent makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying Divisors Not Divisible by 5**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Now, I need to exclude the divisors that involve the prime factor 5. This means setting the exponent of 5 to 0.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  Let's see how many combinations exclude 5:\n  \\[\n  2^0 \\text{ or } 2^1, \\  \n  3^0 \\text{ or } 3^1, \\  \n  5^0  \n  \\]\n  \n  Total combinations without 5:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4  \n  \\]\n  \n  These correspond to:\n  - \\(2^0 \\times 3^0 = 1\\)\n  - \\(2^1 \\times 3^0 = 2\\)\n  - \\(2^0 \\times 3^1 = 3\\)\n  - \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 = 6\\)\n\n- **Check:**  \n  So, there are 4 divisors not involving 5: 1, 2, 3, and 6. This makes sense because excluding 5 reduces the number of combinations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach with an Alternative Method**\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  To ensure correctness, let's consider another method\u2014perhaps listing all divisors and filtering them.\n\n- **Approach:**  \n  List all divisors of 150 and then remove those divisible by 5.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - **List of Divisors:**  \n    From the prime factorization, each divisor is of the form \\(2^a \\times 3^b \\times 5^c\\) where:\n    \n    - \\(a = 0 \\text{ or } 1\\)\n    - \\(b = 0 \\text{ or } 1\\)\n    - \\(c = 0, 1, \\text{ or } 2\\)\n    \n    Let's generate them:\n    \n    1. \\(2^0 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^0 = 1\\)\n    2. \\(2^0 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^1 = 5\\)\n    3. \\(2^0 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^2 = 25\\)\n    4. \\(2^0 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^0 = 3\\)\n    5. \\(2^0 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 15\\)\n    6. \\(2^0 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 = 75\\)\n    7. \\(2^1 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^0 = 2\\)\n    8. \\(2^1 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^1 = 10\\)\n    9. \\(2^1 \\times 3^0 \\times 5^2 = 50\\)\n    10. \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^0 = 6\\)\n    11. \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 30\\)\n    12. \\(2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 = 150\\)\n    \n  - **Divisors Not Divisible by 5:**  \n    Filtering out those divisible by 5:\n    \n    - 1\n    - 2\n    - 3\n    - 6\n    \n    Total: 4 divisors\n\n- **Check:**  \n  This matches our earlier calculation using prime exponents. Both methods agree, which strengthens the correctness of our solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Verification**\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Does the number 4 seem reasonable for divisors not involving 5? Given that 150 has 12 divisors in total and we're excluding those involving the prime factor 5, reducing the count to 4 seems plausible.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  The approaches align, and the numbers make sense. I haven't encountered any inconsistencies or surprising results, which indicates that the solution is likely correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies\u2014primarily focusing on prime factorization and verifying with a listing approach\u2014I determined that there are **4 positive divisors of 150 that are not divisible by 5:** 1, 2, 3, and 6. Throughout the process, I reflected frequently, checked my calculations, and ensured that each step logically followed the previous one, adjusting my methods as needed to maintain accuracy.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any further questions or if there's another problem you'd like me to tackle!",

  "ground_truth": "First, we find $150=2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2.$ The prime factorization of a divisor of 150 must take the form $2^m3^n5^p$ for nonnegative integers $m\\leq 1$, $n\\leq 1$, and $p\\leq 2$. The requirement that the divisor is not divisible by 5 means that we must have $p=0$. Therefore, there are $2$ possibilities for $m$ (namely, 0 or 1) and the same for $n$ for a total of $2\\cdot 2=\\boxed{4}$ such factors."
