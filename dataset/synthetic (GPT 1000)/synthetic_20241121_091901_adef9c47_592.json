  "problem": "When the length of a rectangle is increased by $20\\%$ and the width increased by $10\\%$, by what percent is the area increased?",
  "solution": "To determine how the area of a rectangle changes when the dimensions are increased by certain percentages, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Original Dimensions\nLet the original length of the rectangle be \\( L \\) and the width be \\( W \\). The original area \\( A \\) is given by:\n\\[\nA = L \\times W\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: New Dimensions After Increases\nWe calculate the new dimensions based on the given percentage increases:\n- The length is increased by \\( 20\\% \\):\n\\[\nL' = L + 0.2L = 1.2L\n\\]\n- The width is increased by \\( 10\\% \\):\n\\[\nW' = W + 0.1W = 1.1W\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: New Area Calculation\nWith the new dimensions, the new area \\( A' \\) is calculated as:\n\\[\nA' = L' \\times W' = (1.2L) \\times (1.1W)\n\\]\nSimplifying this, we find:\n\\[\nA' = 1.2 \\times 1.1 \\times L \\times W = 1.32 \\times (L \\times W) = 1.32A\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Area Increase\nTo find the increase in area, we subtract the original area from the new area:\n\\[\n\\text{Increase in Area} = A' - A = 1.32A - A = 0.32A\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Percentage Increase Calculation\nFinally, to find the percentage increase in the area, we use the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Increase in Area}}{\\text{Original Area}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{0.32A}{A} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 32\\%\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe area of the rectangle is increased by **32%**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>32%</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "If we let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$, then the original area of the rectangle is $lw$. The length is then increased $20\\%$ to $1.2l$ and the width is increased $10\\%$ to $1.1w$, so the new area is $(1.2l)(1.1w)=1.32lw$. There new area is $132\\%$ the old area, which represents a change of $\\boxed{32 \\%}$."
