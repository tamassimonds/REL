  "problem": "Find the equation whose graph is a parabola with vertex $(2,4)$, vertical axis of symmetry, and contains the point $(1,1)$. Express your answer in the form \"$ax^2+bx+c$\".",
  "solution": "To determine the equation of a parabola with a vertex at \\((2, 4)\\) and a vertical axis of symmetry, we start by using the vertex form of a parabola, which is written as:\n\n\\[\ny = a(x - h)^2 + k\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the vertex coordinates \\((h, k)\\) are \\((2, 4)\\). Substituting these values into the equation leads to:\n\n\\[\ny = a(x - 2)^2 + 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient \\(a\\). We can do this by using a point that the parabola passes through, specifically \\((1, 1)\\). We substitute \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n1 = a(1 - 2)^2 + 4\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n1 = a(1) + 4\n\\]\n\\[\n1 = a + 4\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\(a\\), we subtract 4 from both sides:\n\n\\[\na = 1 - 4 = -3\n\\]\n\nNow that we have determined the value of \\(a\\), we can substitute it back into our parabola equation:\n\n\\[\ny = -3(x - 2)^2 + 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we convert this equation into standard form \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) by expanding \\( (x - 2)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation gives us:\n\n\\[\ny = -3(x^2 - 4x + 4) + 4\n\\]\n\nDistributing \\(-3\\) results in:\n\n\\[\ny = -3x^2 + 12x - 12 + 4\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -3x^2 + 12x - 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the equation of the parabola in standard form is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-3x^2 + 12x - 8}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Since the axis of symmetry is vertical and the vertex is $(2,4)$, the parabola may also be written as  \\[y=a(x-2)^2+4\\] for some value of $a$.  Plugging the point $(1,1)$ into this expression gives  \\[1=a(1-2)^2+4=a+4.\\] This tells us $a=-3$.\n\nOur equation is  \\[y=-3(x-2)^2+4.\\] Putting it $y=ax^2+bx+c$ form requires expanding the square, so we get  \\[y=-3(x^2-4x+4)+4=\\boxed{-3x^2+12x-8}.\\]"
