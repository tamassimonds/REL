  "problem": "Express $1.\\overline{27}$ as a common fraction in lowest terms.",
  "solution": "To express the repeating decimal \\(1.\\overline{27}\\) as a common fraction in lowest terms, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the repeating decimal:**\n   Let \\(x = 1.\\overline{27}\\).\n\n2. **Eliminate the repeating part:**\n   Since the repeating part \"27\" consists of 2 digits, we multiply \\(x\\) by \\(100\\):\n   \\[\n   100x = 127.\\overline{27}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set up an equation:**\n   Now we have two equations:\n   \\[\n   100x = 127.272727\\ldots \\quad \\text{(1)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 1.272727\\ldots \\quad \\text{(2)}\n   \\]\n   Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n   \\[\n   100x - x = 127.272727\\ldots - 1.272727\\ldots\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   99x = 126\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   Dividing both sides by 99 gives:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{126}{99}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   We need to reduce \\(\\frac{126}{99}\\) to its lowest terms. First, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 126 and 99:\n   - The prime factorization of \\(126\\) is \\(2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7\\).\n   - The prime factorization of \\(99\\) is \\(3^2 \\times 11\\).\n   The GCD is \\(9\\) (which is \\(3^2\\)).\n\n   Now, we divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{126 \\div 9}{99 \\div 9} = \\frac{14}{11}\n   \\]\n\nThus, \\(1.\\overline{27}\\) can be expressed as the fraction \\(\\frac{14}{11}\\) in lowest terms.\n\nFinal answer:\n\\[\n\\frac{14}{11}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x = 1.\\overline{27}$. We then have $100x =127.\\overline{27}$, so $$ 100x - x = 127.\\overline{27} - 1.\\overline{27} = 126 \\ \\ \\Rightarrow \\ \\ x = \\frac{126}{99} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{11}}. $$"
