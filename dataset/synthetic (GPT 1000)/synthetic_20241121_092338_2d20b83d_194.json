  "problem": "In an office at various times during the day, the boss gives the secretary a letter to type, each time putting the letter on top of the pile in the secretary's in-box. When there is time, the secretary takes the top letter off the pile and types it. There are nine letters to be typed during the day, and the boss delivers them in the order $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\nWhile leaving for lunch, the secretary tells a colleague that letter $8$ has already been typed, but says nothing else about the morning's typing. The colleague wonders which of the nine letters remain to be typed after lunch and in what order they will be typed. Based upon the above information, how many such after-lunch typing orders are possible? (That there are no letters left to be typed is one of the possibilities.)\nRe-stating the problem for clarity, let $S$ be a set arranged in increasing order. At any time an element can be appended to the end of $S$, or the last element of $S$ can be removed. The question asks for the number of different orders in which the all of the remaining elements of $S$ can be removed, given that $8$ had been removed already.\n",
  "solution": "To determine the number of possible typing orders after lunch, given that letter 8 has already been typed, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Problem Overview\n1. **Typing Order**: Letters are delivered in the sequence \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\).\n2. **Stack Mechanism**: Letters are placed in a stack and removed in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner.\n3. **Typed Letters**: We know that letter 8 has been typed, so we need to calculate the possible orders for the remaining letters.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Remaining Letters\nAfter typing letter 8, the remaining letters are from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9\\}\\). Importantly, letter 9 can only be typed after all letters preceding it (in the original delivery order) have been typed.\n\n### Step 2: Count Remaining Letters\nLet \\(k\\) represent the count of letters remaining from \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}\\):\n- If \\(k = 0\\): All letters have been typed, including 8.\n- If \\(k = 1\\): The only letter left is 9.\n- If \\(k = 7\\): All seven letters remain, along with letter 9.\n\n### Step 3: Arranging Remaining Letters\nFor any fixed \\(k\\), the arrangement of the \\(k\\) letters can be done in \\(k!\\) ways. Letter 9 can fit into \\(k + 1\\) positions within this arrangement (before the first letter, between letters, or after the last letter).\n\n### Step 4: Total Arrangements for Each \\(k\\)\nThe total number of arrangements for \\(k\\) remaining letters and letter 9 is:\n\\[\n(k + 1) \\cdot k!\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Sum Over All Possible Values of \\(k\\)\nWe now combine the arrangements for all possible values of \\(k\\) (from 0 to 7):\n\\[\n\\text{Total arrangements} = \\sum_{k=0}^{7} \\binom{7}{k} (k + 1) k!\n\\]\n\n#### Detailed Calculation for Each \\(k\\):\n1. **For \\(k = 0\\)**: \\(1 \\cdot 1 = 1\\)\n2. **For \\(k = 1\\)**: \\(\\binom{7}{1} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 7 \\cdot 2 = 14\\)\n3. **For \\(k = 2\\)**: \\(\\binom{7}{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 21 \\cdot 6 = 126\\)\n4. **For \\(k = 3\\)**: \\(\\binom{7}{3} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 = 35 \\cdot 24 = 840\\)\n5. **For \\(k = 4\\)**: \\(\\binom{7}{4} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 24 = 35 \\cdot 120 = 4200\\)\n6. **For \\(k = 5\\)**: \\(\\binom{7}{5} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 120 = 21 \\cdot 720 = 15120\\)\n7. **For \\(k = 6\\)**: \\(\\binom{7}{6} \\cdot 7 \\cdot 720 = 7 \\cdot 5040 = 35280\\)\n8. **For \\(k = 7\\)**: \\(\\binom{7}{7} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 5040 = 1 \\cdot 40320 = 40320\\)\n\n#### Total Arrangements\nNow we calculate the total:\n\\[\n1 + 14 + 126 + 840 + 4200 + 15120 + 35280 + 40320 = 704\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of possible typing orders available after lunch, given that letter 8 has been typed, is:\n\n**704**",
  "ground_truth": "Since $8$ had already been added to the pile, the numbers $1 \\ldots 7$ had already been added at some time to the pile; $9$ might or might not have been added yet. So currently $S$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, \\ldots 7\\}$, possibly with $9$ at the end. Given that $S$ has $k$ elements, there are $k+1$ intervals for $9$ to be inserted, or $9$ might have already been placed, giving $k+2$ different possibilities.\nThus, the answer is $\\sum_{k=0}^{7} {7 \\choose k}(k+2)$ $= 1 \\cdot 2 + 7 \\cdot 3 + 21 \\cdot 4 + 35 \\cdot 5 + 35 \\cdot 6 + 21 \\cdot 7 + 7 \\cdot 8 + 1 \\cdot 9$ $= \\boxed{704}$."
