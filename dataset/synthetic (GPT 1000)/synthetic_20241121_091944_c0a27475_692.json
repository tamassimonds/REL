  "problem": "Nine people sit down at random seats around a round table. Four of them are math majors, three others are physics majors, and the two remaining people are biology majors. What is the probability that all four math majors sit in consecutive seats?",
  "solution": "To find the probability that all four math majors sit in consecutive seats around a circular table with nine people (four math majors, three physics majors, and two biology majors), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Total Arrangements\nFor \\( n \\) people sitting around a circular table, the total arrangements are given by \\( (n-1)! \\). Here, with 9 people, the total arrangements are:\n\\[\n\\text{Total arrangements} = (9-1)! = 8! = 40320.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Treat Math Majors as a Single Block\nTo find arrangements where all four math majors sit together, we can treat them as a single \"block.\" This reduces our problem to arranging this block, along with the three physics majors and two biology majors. Now, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of blocks/entities} = 6 \\text{ (1 math block + 3 physics + 2 biology)}.\n\\]\n\nThe arrangements of these 6 entities around the table are:\n\\[\n\\text{Arrangements of 6 entities} = (6-1)! = 5! = 120.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Arrange the Math Majors Within the Block\nWithin the \"math block,\" the four math majors can be arranged in \\( 4! \\) ways:\n\\[\n\\text{Arrangements of math majors within the block} = 4! = 24.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Favorable Arrangements\nTo find the total number of favorable arrangements where the math majors sit together, we multiply the arrangements of the 6 entities by the arrangements of the math majors within their block:\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable arrangements} = 5! \\times 4! = 120 \\times 24 = 2880.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Probability\nFinally, the probability \\( P \\) that all four math majors sit in consecutive seats is:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Favorable arrangements}}{\\text{Total arrangements}} = \\frac{2880}{40320}.\n\\]\nSimplifying this fraction gives:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{14}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the probability that all four math majors sit in consecutive seats around the table is \\(\\frac{1}{14}\\).",
  "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{9}{4}=126$ ways to choose the seats for the four math majors. Of these ways, there are only 9 where the four math majors sit in consecutive seats. Therefore, the probability that the math majors sit in consecutive seats is $\\frac{9}{126}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{14}}$."
