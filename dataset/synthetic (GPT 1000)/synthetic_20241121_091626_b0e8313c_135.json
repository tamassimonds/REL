  "solution": "To determine the maximum possible value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two consecutive terms in the sequence defined by \\( a_n = n! + n \\), we start by analyzing the terms \\( a_n \\) and \\( a_{n+1} \\):\n\n1. **Definitions of the Terms**:\n   - The \\( n \\)-th term is \\( a_n = n! + n \\).\n   - The \\((n+1)\\)-th term can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     a_{n+1} = (n+1)! + (n+1) = (n+1) \\cdot n! + (n+1) = (n+1)(n! + 1)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Computing the GCD**:\n   - We need to find \\( \\gcd(a_n, a_{n+1}) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\gcd(a_n, a_{n+1}) = \\gcd(n! + n, (n+1)(n! + 1))\n     \\]\n   - Using the property of GCD, we adjust the second term:\n     \\[\n     \\gcd(n! + n, (n+1)(n! + 1) - (n+1)(n! + n))\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     (n+1)(n! + 1) - (n+1)(n! + n) = (n+1)(1 - n)\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\gcd(a_n, a_{n+1}) = \\gcd(n! + n, (n+1)(1 - n))\n     \\]\n\n3. **Examining Different Values of \\( n \\)**:\n   - We analyze the GCD for specific values of \\( n \\):\n     - For \\( n = 0 \\):\n       \\[\n       a_0 = 1, \\quad a_1 = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\gcd(1, 2) = 1\n       \\]\n     - For \\( n = 1 \\):\n       \\[\n       a_1 = 2, \\quad a_2 = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\gcd(2, 4) = 2\n       \\]\n     - For \\( n = 2 \\):\n       \\[\n       a_2 = 4, \\quad a_3 = 6 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\gcd(4, 6) = 2\n       \\]\n     - For \\( n = 3 \\):\n       \\[\n       a_3 = 6, \\quad a_4 = 28 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\gcd(6, 28) = 2\n       \\]\n     - For \\( n = 4 \\):\n       \\[\n       a_4 = 28, \\quad a_5 = 125 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\gcd(28, 125) = 1\n       \\]\n     - For \\( n \\geq 5 \\), the rapid growth of \\( n! \\) results in distinct prime factors, implying:\n       \\[\n       \\gcd(a_n, a_{n+1}) = 1 \\quad \\text{for } n \\geq 4\n       \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The maximum GCD found is \\( 2 \\), which occurs at \\( n = 1 \\). For \\( n \\geq 4 \\), the GCD is \\( 1 \\). Thus, the maximum possible value of the GCD of two consecutive terms in the sequence is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{2}\n   \\] \n\nThis solution presents a clear progression through definitions, calculations, and evaluations of different cases to arrive at the final answer.",
  "ground_truth": "We start by taking the first step in the Euclidean algorithm: subtract the initial two terms. Notice that\n\\begin{align*}a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n &= (n+1)! + n + 1 - (n+1)(n! + n) \\\\ &= (n+1)! + n + 1 - (n+1)! - n(n+1) \\\\ &= -n^2 + 1 = -(n-1)(n+1).\n\\end{align*}It follows that by the Euclidean Algorithm, \\begin{align*}\\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, a_{n+1}) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n)\\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a_n, (n-1)(n+1)),\\end{align*}since the minus sign is irrelevant for calculating the gcd.\n\nWe know that $n-1$ divides $n!$, so that $n-1$ is relatively prime to $a_n = n! + n$:\n$$\\text{gcd}\\,(n-1,n!+n) = \\text{gcd}\\,(n-1,n) = 1.$$Thus, we can ignore the factor of $n-1$ completely, and say that\n$$\\text{gcd}\\,(a_n,a_{n+1}) = \\text{gcd}\\,(n! + n, n+1).$$Now, we have several cases, depending on whether $n+1$ is prime or composite. We also have a few edge cases to consider. The basic idea is that when $n+1$ is composite and greater than $4$, $n+1$ is a factor of $n!$, whereas when $n+1$ is prime, we can apply Wilson's Theorem.\n\n$\\textit{Case 0:}$ For $n = 0$, we find that $a_0 = 1, a_1 = 2$, with greatest common divisor $1$.\n\n$\\textit{Case composite:}$\n\n$\\qquad \\textit{Subcase 1:}$ If $n+1$ is composite and can be written as the product of two distinct integers greater than $1$ (say $n+1 = a \\times b$, $a > b > 1$), then $n+1$ divides\n$$n! = 1 \\times \\cdots \\times b \\times \\cdots \\times a \\times \\cdots \\times n.$$By the same argument as before, since $n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, then $n! + n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, yielding a greatest common divisor of $1$.\n\n$\\qquad \\textit{Subcase 2:}$ If $n+1 = p^2$ for some prime $p$, then $n! + n = (p^2 - 1)! + p^2-1$. If $2p < p^2 - 1$, then $p$ and $2p$ are both factors that appear in the expansion of $n!$, so $n+1$ divides $n!$ and the previous argument applies. For $p = 2$, we can quickly check that $3! + 3 = 9$ is relatively prime with $4$.\n\n$\\textit{Case prime:}$ If $n + 1 = p$ for some prime $p$, then $n! + n \\equiv (p-1)! + (p-1) \\equiv -2 \\pmod{p}$ by Wilson's Theorem. Thus, $n! + n$ is relatively prime with $n+1$ unless $n = 1$, for which we obtain $a_1 = 2, a_2 = 4$, with greatest common divisor 2.\n\nSo, the largest the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms of the sequence $a_n$ can be is $\\boxed{2}$, which is achieved when we take $n=1$."
