  "problem": "Mary told John her score on the American High School Mathematics Examination (AHSME), which was over $80$. From this, John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly. If Mary's score had been any lower, but still over $80$, John could not have determined this. What was Mary's score? (Recall that the AHSME consists of $30$ multiple choice problems and that one's score, $s$, is computed by the formula $s=30+4c-w$, where $c$ is the number of correct answers and $w$ is the number of wrong answers. (Students are not penalized for problems left unanswered.)\n",
  "solution": "To find Mary's score on the American High School Mathematics Examination (AHSME), we use the scoring formula:\n\n\\[\ns = 30 + 4c - w\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( s \\) is the score,\n- \\( c \\) is the number of correctly solved problems,\n- \\( w \\) is the number of incorrectly solved problems.\n\nSince there are a total of 30 questions, we can express \\( w \\) in terms of \\( c \\) and \\( u \\) (the number of unanswered questions) as follows:\n\n\\[\nw = 30 - c - u\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( w \\) into the scoring formula gives:\n\n\\[\ns = 30 + 4c - (30 - c - u) = 5c + u\n\\]\n\nGiven that Mary claims her score is over 80, we have \\( s > 80 \\). For John to uniquely determine \\( c \\) from \\( s \\), the expression \\( s - u = 5c \\) must yield a unique integer solution for \\( c \\) for each value of \\( u \\).\n\nThis implies that \\( s - u \\) must be divisible by 5. Therefore, we start testing possible scores \\( s \\) beginning from 81 while varying \\( u \\) from 0 to 30:\n\n1. **If \\( u = 0 \\)**: \n   \\[\n   s = 5c \\implies c = \\frac{s}{5}\n   \\]\n\n2. **If \\( u = 1 \\)**: \n   \\[\n   s = 5c + 1 \\implies c = \\frac{s - 1}{5}\n   \\]\n\n3. **If \\( u = 2 \\)**: \n   \\[\n   s = 5c + 2 \\implies c = \\frac{s - 2}{5}\n   \\]\n\nContinuing this pattern, we need to find \\( s \\) such that all values yield a unique integer \\( c \\) for different \\( u \\).\n\nStarting with \\( s = 81 \\):\n\n- For \\( u = 0 \\): \\( c = 16.2 \\) (not an integer)\n- For \\( u = 1 \\): \\( c = 16 \\) (valid)\n- For \\( u = 2 \\): \\( c = 15.8 \\) (not an integer)\n\nContinuing this analysis for various \\( s \\) values (up to 119), we observe patterns in \\( c \\):\n\nEventually, we find scores up to \\( s = 119 \\):\n\n- For \\( s = 119 \\):\n   - \\( 119 - u = 5c \\)\n   - Testing values for \\( u \\):\n     - \\( u = 0: c = 23.8 \\) (not integer)\n     - \\( u = 1: c = 23.6 \\) (not integer)\n     - \\( u = 2: c = 23.4 \\) (not integer)\n     - \\( u = 3: c = 23.2 \\) (not integer)\n     - \\( u = 4: c = 23 \\) (valid)\n\nThus, we conclude that at \\( s = 119 \\), the only configuration that yields a unique \\( c \\) across all tested \\( u \\) values exists.\n\nTherefore, Mary's score on the AHSME is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Final result: } \\boxed{119}\n\\] \n\nThis score uniquely identifies the number of problems Mary solved correctly under the given conditions.",
  "ground_truth": "Let Mary's score, number correct, and number wrong be $s,c,w$ respectively. Then\n$s=30+4c-w=30+4(c-1)-(w-4)=30+4(c+1)-(w+4)$.\nTherefore, Mary could not have left at least five blank; otherwise, one more correct and four more wrong would produce the same score. Similarly, Mary could not have answered at least four wrong (clearly Mary answered at least one right to have a score above $80$, or even $30$.)\nIt follows that $c+w\\geq 26$ and $w\\leq 3$, so $c\\geq 23$ and $s=30+4c-w\\geq 30+4(23)-3=119$. So Mary scored at least $119$. To see that no result other than $23$ right/$3$ wrong produces $119$, note that $s=119\\Rightarrow 4c-w=89$ so $w\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}$. But if $w=3$, then $c=23$, which was the result given; otherwise $w\\geq 7$ and $c\\geq 24$, but this implies at least $31$ questions, a contradiction. This makes the minimum score $\\boxed{119}$."
