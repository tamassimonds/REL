  "problem": "For all composite integers $n$, what is the largest integer that always divides into the difference between $n$ and the cube of $n$?",
  "solution": "To determine the largest integer that consistently divides the difference between a composite integer \\( n \\) and its cube \\( n^3 \\) (i.e., \\( n - n^3 \\)), we'll follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Factor the expression**\n\nWe start with:\n\n\\[\nn - n^3 = n(1 - n^2)\n\\]\n\nNext, we can further factor \\( 1 - n^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n1 - n^2 = (1 - n)(1 + n)\n\\]\n\nThus, we rewrite the original expression as:\n\n\\[\nn - n^3 = n(1 - n)(1 + n)\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors for composite integers \\( n \\)**\n\nTo find a common divisor, we examine the factors \\( n \\), \\( 1 - n \\), and \\( 1 + n \\):\n\n1. **Factor \\( n \\)**: Since \\( n \\) is composite, it contains at least one prime factor.\n2. **Factor \\( 1 - n \\)**: This factor varies with \\( n \\) and does not guarantee specific divisibility.\n3. **Factor \\( 1 + n \\)**: This term is even if \\( n \\) is odd, while it remains odd if \\( n \\) is even.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate specific values of \\( n \\)**\n\nLet's calculate the difference for various composite integers:\n\n- For \\( n = 4 \\):\n  \\[\n  4 - 4^3 = 4 - 64 = -60\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( n = 6 \\):\n  \\[\n  6 - 6^3 = 6 - 216 = -210\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( n = 8 \\):\n  \\[\n  8 - 8^3 = 8 - 512 = -504\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( n = 9 \\):\n  \\[\n  9 - 9^3 = 9 - 729 = -720\n  \\]\n\n**Step 4: Finding the GCD**\n\nNow we find the factorization of each result:\n\n- For \\( n = 4 \\): \\( -60 = -1 \\times 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\)\n- For \\( n = 6 \\): \\( -210 = -1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\)\n- For \\( n = 8 \\): \\( -504 = -1 \\times 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\)\n- For \\( n = 9 \\): \\( -720 = -1 \\times 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\)\n\nThe common factors across these results reveal that both 2 and 3 appear:\n\n- The GCD of the values \\( -60 \\), \\( -210 \\), \\( -504 \\), and \\( -720 \\) is determined to be \\( 6 \\) since all numbers share these prime factors.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nTherefore, the largest integer that always divides \\( n - n^3 \\) for composite integers \\( n \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The answer is } \\boxed{6}\n\\] \n\nThis confirms that our final answer remains \\( \\text{<ANSWER>6</ANSWER>} \\).",
  "ground_truth": "Notice that $n^3 - n$ factors as $n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = (n-1)n(n+1)$. We observe that among any three consecutive integers, at least one must be divisible by $2$ and one must be divisible by $3$. Thus, we know that $6$ must always divide into $n^3 - n$. Indeed, this is the largest such integer; for $n = 6$, then $n^3 - n = 210 = 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, and for $n = 33$, then $n^3 - n = 32 \\cdot 33 \\cdot 34 = 6 \\cdot 32 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 17$, whose greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{6}$."
