  "problem": "Define an ordered quadruple of integers $(a, b, c, d)$ as interesting if $1 \\le a<b<c<d \\le 10$, and $a+d>b+c$. How many interesting ordered quadruples are there?\n",
  "solution": "To find the number of interesting ordered quadruples of integers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) that satisfy the conditions \\(1 \\leq a < b < c < d \\leq 10\\) and \\(a + d > b + c\\), we can break down the problem into manageable steps.\n\n### Step 1: Count All Possible Ordered Quadruples\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of ways to select 4 distinct integers from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10\\}\\). Since \\(a, b, c,\\) and \\(d\\) must be distinct and ordered such that \\(a < b < c < d\\), we can use the binomial coefficient to find this count:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total quadruples} = \\binom{10}{4} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 210\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Condition \\(a + d > b + c\\)\n\nNext, we need to filter these combinations by the condition \\(a + d > b + c\\). Rearranging this condition, we get:\n\n\\[\na + d - b - c > 0 \\implies a - b > c - d\n\\]\n\nThis means the difference between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be greater than the difference between \\(c\\) and \\(d\\).\n\n### Step 3: Setting Up the Problem\n\nTo better analyze the inequalities, we can introduce a new variable \\(e = 11\\) (as \\(d \\leq 10\\)). We then define new variables:\n\n- \\(x_1 = a - 1\\)\n- \\(x_2 = b - a - 1\\)\n- \\(x_3 = c - b - 1\\)\n- \\(x_4 = d - c - 1\\)\n- \\(x_5 = e - d - 1\\)\n\nThese variables represent the gaps between the chosen integers and help us set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 6\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Use Stars and Bars to Count Solutions\n\nUsing the method of stars and bars, we can find the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation, which counts the distributions of the gaps:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of solutions} = \\binom{6 + 5 - 1}{5 - 1} = \\binom{10}{4} = 210\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Exclude Invalid Cases\n\nAlthough we started with 210 valid quadruples, we need to account for cases where \\(b - a \\leq d - c\\). Let\u2019s denote the number of partitions where \\(b - a = d - c\\) as \\(N\\). We can analyze these cases:\n\n- **Two parts equal to 0**: There are \\(\\binom{8}{2} = 28\\) ways.\n- **Two parts equal to 1**: There are \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\) ways.\n- **Two parts equal to 2**: There are \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\) ways.\n- **Two parts equal to 3**: There is \\(\\binom{2}{2} = 1\\) way.\n\nAdding these scenarios gives:\n\n\\[\nN = 28 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 50\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Interesting Quadruples\n\nTo find the interesting quadruples (where \\(a + d > b + c\\)), we take the valid combinations and exclude the equal cases:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Interesting quadruples} = \\frac{210 - N}{2} = \\frac{210 - 50}{2} = \\frac{160}{2} = 80\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the total number of interesting ordered quadruples \\((a, b, c, d)\\) that satisfy both conditions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{80}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Rearranging the inequality we get $d-c > b-a$. Let $e = 11$, then $(a, b-a, c-b, d-c, e-d)$ is a partition of 11 into 5 positive integers or equivalently: $(a-1, b-a-1, c-b-1, d-c-1, e-d-1)$ is a partition of 6 into 5 non-negative integer parts. Via a standard stars and bars argument, the number of ways to partition 6 into 5 non-negative parts is $\\binom{6+4}4 = \\binom{10}4 = 210$. The interesting quadruples correspond to partitions where the second number is less than the fourth. By symmetry, there are as many partitions where the fourth is less than the second. So, if $N$ is the number of partitions where the second element is equal to the fourth, our answer is $(210-N)/2$.\nWe find $N$ as a sum of 4 cases:\ntwo parts equal to zero, $\\binom82 = 28$ ways,\ntwo parts equal to one, $\\binom62 = 15$ ways,\ntwo parts equal to two, $\\binom42 = 6$ ways,\ntwo parts equal to three, $\\binom22 = 1$ way.\nTherefore, $N = 28 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 50$ and our answer is $(210 - 50)/2 = \\boxed{80}$."
