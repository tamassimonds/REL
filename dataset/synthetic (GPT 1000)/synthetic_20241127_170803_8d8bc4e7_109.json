  "problem": "When $0.\\overline{36}$ is expressed as a common fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's consolidate the original approach into a clear, cohesive solution. I'll ensure each step flows logically while maintaining the natural thought process. Here's how it would look:\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n#### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to express \\(0.\\overline{36}\\) as a common fraction in its lowest terms and then find the sum of the numerator and denominator.\n\n#### **First Thoughts**\n\n- This is a repeating decimal problem.\n- Converting repeating decimals to fractions sounds familiar.\n- The **algebraic method** seems like a good starting point.\n\n#### **Exploring the Algebraic Method**\n\n1. **Set Up the Equation**\n\n   Let's assign the repeating decimal to a variable:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 0.\\overline{36}\n   \\]\n\n   *<Reflection:* This feels right as it allows us to manipulate the decimal algebraically.*\n\n2. **Eliminate the Repeating Part**\n\n   Since the decimal repeats every two digits, multiply both sides by 100 to shift the decimal point:\n\n   \\[\n   100x = 36.\\overline{36}\n   \\]\n\n   *<Check:* By multiplying by 100, the repeating part aligns, which is correct.*\n\n3. **Subtract the Original Equation**\n\n   Subtract the initial equation from this new one:\n\n   \\[\n   100x - x = 36.\\overline{36} - 0.\\overline{36}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying:\n\n   \\[\n   99x = 36\n   \\]\n\n   *<Reflection:* The repeating decimals cancel out, which confirms the correctness of this step.*\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**\n\n   Divide both sides by 99 to isolate \\( x \\):\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{36}{99}\n   \\]\n\n   *<Check:* We have a fraction, but it needs simplification.*\n\n5. **Simplify the Fraction**\n\n   Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 36 and 99:\n\n   - Both 36 and 99 are divisible by 9.\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36 \\div 9}{99 \\div 9} = \\frac{4}{11}\n   \\]\n\n   *<Reflection:* \\(\\frac{4}{11}\\) is in its lowest terms since 4 and 11 have no common factors.*\n\n#### **Verification**\n\n- **Convert Back to Decimal:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{4}{11} = 0.363636\\ldots = 0.\\overline{36}\n  \\]\n\n  *<Check:* The decimal representation matches the original, confirming the fraction is correct.*\n\n#### **Final Calculation**\n\n- **Sum of Numerator and Denominator:**\n\n  \\[\n  4 + 11 = 15\n  \\]\n\n  *<Check:* Simple addition confirms the sum is 15.*\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>**\n\n**<ANSWER>**\n\n15\n\n**solution</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThrough this structured approach:\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Multiple strategies were considered, but the algebraic method proved effective.\n- **Reflection and Verification:** Each step was carefully checked to ensure accuracy.\n- **Final Confirmation:** The fraction was verified by converting back to the decimal form, ensuring correctness before calculating the final sum.\n\nBy methodically working through the problem and continuously checking for correctness, we arrived confidently at the final answer: **15**.",
  "ground_truth": "$0.\\overline{36}=\\frac{36}{99}=\\frac{4}{11}$. The sum of the numerator and denominator is $4+11=\\boxed{15}$."
