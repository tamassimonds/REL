  "problem": "What is the greatest number of points of intersection that can occur when $2$ different circles and $2$ different straight lines are drawn on the same piece of paper?",
  "solution": "To determine the maximum number of intersection points that can occur with 2 different circles and 2 different straight lines, we can analyze the intersections step by step:\n\n1. **Intersections Between Circles:**\n   - Two different circles can intersect at most at **2 points**.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Max intersections between circles} = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Intersections Between Lines:**\n   - Two different straight lines can intersect at most at **1 point**.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Max intersections between lines} = 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intersections Between Lines and Circles:**\n   - Each line can intersect each circle at most at **2 points**. \n   - Therefore, when considering both lines with both circles:\n   \n   For one line with both circles:\n   - Intersections for Line 1 with both circles: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\n   - Intersections for Line 2 with both circles: \\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\n   \n   Thus, the total maximum intersections between the two lines and two circles is:\n   \\[\n   4 + 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Points of Intersection:**\n   - We can now sum all the possible points of intersection:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Intersections} = (\\text{Intersections between circles}) + (\\text{Intersections between lines}) + (\\text{Intersections between lines and circles})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 2 + 1 + 8 = 11\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the greatest number of points of intersection that can occur when drawing 2 different circles and 2 different straight lines on the same piece of paper is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]",
