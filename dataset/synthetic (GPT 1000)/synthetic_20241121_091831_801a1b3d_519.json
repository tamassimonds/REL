  "problem": "If $f(x)=f(2-x)$ for all $x$, then what line is necessarily an axis of symmetry of the graph of $y=f(x)$? (Give the simplest equation of this line.)",
  "solution": "To determine the axis of symmetry for the function defined by \\( f(x) = f(2 - x) \\), we analyze the implications of this functional equation regarding the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Functional Equation\nThe equation \\( f(x) = f(2 - x) \\) means that for every value of \\( x \\), the function takes the same value at \\( x \\) and at its reflection \\( 2 - x \\). This suggests that the graph of the function is symmetric with respect to a certain vertical line.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Center of Symmetry\nTo find the axis of symmetry, we identify the midpoint between any point \\( x \\) and its reflection \\( 2 - x \\):\n- Let \\( a = x \\), then the corresponding paired point is \\( 2 - a \\).\n- The midpoint \\( M \\) can be calculated as follows:\n  \\[\n  M = \\frac{x + (2 - x)}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion about the Symmetry\nSince the relationship \\( f(x) = f(2 - x) \\) holds for all \\( x \\), and since the midpoint is consistently \\( 1 \\), it follows that the function \\( f(x) \\) exhibits symmetry about the vertical line \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the axis of symmetry for the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) is:\n\n<ANSWER> \\( x = 1 \\) </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "For every point $(x,y)$ on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we know $(2-x,y)$ is also on the graph of $y=f(x)$.\n\nWe have $x = 1+(x-1)$ and $2-x = 1-(x-1)$, so the geometric transformation which takes $(x,y)$ to $(2-x,y)$ is reflection across the vertical line $\\boxed{x=1}$."
