  "problem": "\"Modulo $m$ graph paper\" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\\le x, y <m$. To graph a congruence on modulo $m$ graph paper, we mark every point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the congruence. For example, a graph of $y\\equiv x^2\\pmod 5$ would consist of the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$.\n\nThe graph of $$3x\\equiv 4y-1 \\pmod{35}$$has a single $x$-intercept $(x_0,0)$ and a single $y$-intercept $(0,y_0)$, where $0\\le x_0,y_0<35$.\n\nWhat is the value of $x_0+y_0$?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem step by step, emulating a natural brainstorming process just like a human would. I'll explore different strategies, reflect on their validity, check for correctness along the way, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, so we're dealing with a congruence equation on modulo graph paper:\n\n\\[  \n3x \\equiv 4y - 1 \\pmod{35}  \n\\]\n\nWe need to find the \\(x\\)-intercept \\((x_0, 0)\\) and the \\(y\\)-intercept \\((0, y_0)\\), with \\(0 \\leq x_0, y_0 < 35\\). Ultimately, we need to determine \\(x_0 + y_0\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- This reminds me of linear equations and finding intercepts, but in a modular arithmetic context.\n- Modulo 35 suggests that both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are residues within that range.\n- I know that finding intercepts typically involves setting one variable to zero and solving for the other.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Solve for \\(x_0\\) by setting \\(y = 0\\):** This should give us the \\(x\\)-intercept.\n2. **Solve for \\(y_0\\) by setting \\(x = 0\\):** This should yield the \\(y\\)-intercept.\n3. **Check if the equation is solvable modulo 35:** Ensure that solutions exist.\n4. **Consider breaking down modulo 35 into its prime factors (5 and 7) to simplify calculations.**\n\nAt first glance, setting \\(y = 0\\) and \\(x = 0\\) seems straightforward. Let's proceed with this approach and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the \\(x\\)-Intercept \\((x_0, 0)\\)**\n\n**Approach:**\n\nSet \\(y = 0\\) in the equation to solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[  \n3x \\equiv 4(0) - 1 \\pmod{35} \\implies 3x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{35}  \n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[  \n3x \\equiv 34 \\pmod{35}  \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Need to solve for \\(x\\).\n- This is a linear congruence equation.\n- I recall that to solve \\(3x \\equiv 34 \\pmod{35}\\), I can find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 35, then multiply both sides by this inverse.\n\n**Exploring Inverses:**\n\n- **Do I remember how to find modular inverses?** Yes, I can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n\n**Applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**\n\n- Find \\(k\\) such that \\(3k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{35}\\).\n\nLet me work this out:\n\n\\[  \n35 = 3 \\times 11 + 2 \\\\  \n3 = 2 \\times 1 + 1 \\\\  \n2 = 1 \\times 2 + 0  \n\\]\n\nTracing back:\n\n\\[  \n1 = 3 - 2 \\times 1 \\\\  \n1 = 3 - (35 - 3 \\times 11) \\times 1 \\\\  \n1 = 3 - 35 + 33 \\\\  \n1 = 36 - 35  \n\\]\n\nSo, \\(3 \\times 12 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{35}\\). Therefore, the inverse of 3 modulo 35 is 12.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, because \\(3 \\times 12 = 36\\) and \\(36 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{35}\\).\n\n**Solving for \\(x\\):**\n\nMultiply both sides of the original equation by 12:\n\n\\[  \nx \\equiv 34 \\times 12 \\pmod{35}  \n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[  \n34 \\times 12 = 408  \n\\]\n\nNow, find \\(408 \\mod 35\\):\n\n\\[  \n408 \\div 35 = 11 \\text{ remainder } 23  \n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[  \nx \\equiv 23 \\pmod{35}  \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Is \\(3 \\times 23 \\equiv 34 \\pmod{35}\\)?**  \n  \\[  \n  3 \\times 23 = 69 \\\\  \n  69 \\mod 35 = 34  \n  \\]  \n- **Result:** Yes, it satisfies the equation.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\nTherefore, the \\(x\\)-intercept is \\((23, 0)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the \\(y\\)-Intercept \\((0, y_0)\\)**\n\n**Approach:**\n\nSet \\(x = 0\\) in the original equation to solve for \\(y\\):\n\n\\[  \n3(0) \\equiv 4y - 1 \\pmod{35} \\implies 4y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{35}  \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Need to solve \\(4y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{35}\\).\n- This requires finding the multiplicative inverse of 4 modulo 35.\n\n**Exploring Inverses Again:**\n\n- Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find \\(k\\) such that \\(4k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{35}\\).\n\n**Applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**\n\n\\[  \n35 = 4 \\times 8 + 3 \\\\  \n4 = 3 \\times 1 + 1 \\\\  \n3 = 1 \\times 3 + 0  \n\\]\n\nTracing back:\n\n\\[  \n1 = 4 - 3 \\times 1 \\\\  \n1 = 4 - (35 - 4 \\times 8) \\times 1 \\\\  \n1 = 4 - 35 + 32 \\\\  \n1 = 36 - 35  \n\\]\n\nThus, \\(4 \\times 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{35}\\). Therefore, the inverse of 4 modulo 35 is 9.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, because \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\) and \\(36 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{35}\\).\n\n**Solving for \\(y\\):**\n\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 9:\n\n\\[  \ny \\equiv 1 \\times 9 \\pmod{35} \\implies y \\equiv 9 \\pmod{35}  \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Is \\(4 \\times 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{35}\\)?**  \n  \\[  \n  4 \\times 9 = 36 \\\\  \n  36 \\mod 35 = 1  \n  \\]  \n- **Result:** Yes, it satisfies the equation.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\nTherefore, the \\(y\\)-intercept is \\((0, 9)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\(x_0 + y_0\\)**\n\n**Expression:**\n\n\\[  \nx_0 + y_0 = 23 + 9  \n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[  \n23 + 9 = 32  \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is this a reasonable result?** Yes, both \\(x_0\\) and \\(y_0\\) are within the range \\(0 \\leq x_0, y_0 < 35\\), and their sum \\(32\\) also fits within this context.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick Verification:** Adding 23 and 9 indeed yields 32, which is less than 35, so no modular reduction is needed.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\(<ANSWER>32 solution</ANSWER>\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(x_0 + y_0 = 32\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Recap and Reflection**\n\n**Summary of Steps:**\n\n1. **Found \\(x_0\\):** Solved \\(3x \\equiv 34 \\pmod{35}\\) to get \\(x_0 = 23\\).\n2. **Found \\(y_0\\):** Solved \\(4y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{35}\\) to get \\(y_0 = 9\\).\n3. **Computed \\(x_0 + y_0\\):** Added the intercepts to obtain \\(32\\).\n\n**Alternative Strategies Considered:**\n\n- Initially thought about breaking down modulo 35 into its prime factors (5 and 7) to simplify, but the direct approach of finding intercepts worked efficiently.\n- If the direct method hadn't worked, leveraging the Chinese Remainder Theorem could have been an alternative.\n\n**Checking the Final Answer:**\n\n- Both intercepts satisfy the original congruence equation.\n- The sum \\(x_0 + y_0 = 32\\) is within the expected range.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- The straightforward method of setting \\(y = 0\\) and \\(x = 0\\) to find the intercepts was effective.\n- Ensuring that modular inverses were correctly calculated was crucial to obtaining the correct intercepts.\n- Regular checks along the way helped verify the correctness of each step, leading to a confident final answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy systematically approaching the problem, exploring and verifying each step, and maintaining flexibility in strategies, we've successfully determined that\n\n\\(<ANSWER>32 solution</ANSWER>\\)\n\nthe sum of the intercepts is **32**.",
  "ground_truth": "To find the $x$-intercept, we plug in $0$ for $y$ and solve $$3x\\equiv 4(0)-1 \\pmod{35}.$$Multiplying both sides by $12$, we get $$36x \\equiv -12\\pmod{35}$$and thus $x\\equiv -12\\pmod{35}$. Translating this to the interval $0\\le x<35$, we have $x\\equiv 23\\pmod{35}$, so the $x$-intercept on our graph is at $(23,0)$.\n\nTo find the $y$-intercept, we plug in $0$ for $x$ and solve $$3(0)\\equiv 4y-1 \\pmod{35}.$$We can rewrite this as $$1\\equiv 4y\\pmod{35}.$$Multiplying both sides by $9$, we get $$9\\equiv 36y\\pmod{35},$$and thus $y\\equiv 9\\pmod{35}$. So the $y$-intercept is at $(0,9)$.\n\nWe have $x_0+y_0 = 23+9 = \\boxed{32}$."
