  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem step by step, embracing a natural problem-solving approach. We'll brainstorm various strategies, reflect often, and ensure our solution is correct by checking each step. Here's how we'll proceed:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nLooking at the function:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{\\sin^3 x + 6 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x + 2 \\cos^2 x - 8}{\\sin x - 1}\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis involves trigonometric functions, specifically sine and cosine. The denominator \\(\\sin x - 1\\) stands out because dividing by zero would make the function undefined, so we need to keep in mind that \\(\\sin x \\neq 1\\).\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Simplify the Numerator:** Perhaps factor or simplify the numerator to see if it cancels out the denominator.\n2. **Explore Limits:** Consider what happens near points where \\(\\sin x = 1\\).\n3. **Substitution:** Maybe substituting \\(\\sin x = t\\) could make things easier.\n4. **Graphical Analysis:** Visualizing the function to gain intuition about its range.\n\nI'll **start** by trying to **simplify the numerator**. If that doesn't work, I'll explore other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplifying the Numerator**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's see if we can factor the numerator to potentially cancel out the \\(\\sin x - 1\\) in the denominator. Factoring trigonometric expressions can often simplify things significantly.\n\n**Writing it Out:**  \nNumerator: \\(\\sin^3 x + 6 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x + 2 \\cos^2 x - 8\\)\n\nI notice that \\(\\sin^3 x\\), \\(\\sin^2 x\\), and \\(\\sin x\\) are all terms involving \\(\\sin x\\), so factoring by \\(\\sin x\\) might help. However, there's also a \\(\\cos^2 x\\) term. I remember the **Pythagorean identity**:\n\n\\[\n\\cos^2 x = 1 - \\sin^2 x\n\\]\n\n**Substitution:**  \nLet's substitute \\(\\cos^2 x\\) with \\(1 - \\sin^2 x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin^3 x + 6 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x + 2(1 - \\sin^2 x) - 8\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^3 x + 6 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x + 2 - 2 \\sin^2 x - 8\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^3 x + (6 \\sin^2 x - 2 \\sin^2 x) + \\sin x + (2 - 8) = \\sin^3 x + 4 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x - 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAfter simplifying, the numerator becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^3 x + 4 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x - 6\n\\]\n\nI still have a cubic term in \\(\\sin x\\). Perhaps I can factor this further by \\(\\sin x - 1\\), which matches our denominator.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Factoring the Numerator by \\(\\sin x - 1\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf \\(\\sin x - 1\\) is a factor of the numerator, I should be able to divide the numerator by \\(\\sin x - 1\\) without leaving a remainder. This would simplify the function significantly.\n\n**Attempting Polynomial Division:**  \nLet's perform synthetic division or polynomial long division to see if \\(\\sin x - 1\\) is a factor of the numerator.\n\n**Setting Up Synthetic Division:**\n\n- **Dividend:** \\(\\sin^3 x + 4 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x - 6\\)\n- **Divisor:** \\(\\sin x - 1\\)\n\n**Performing the Division:**\n\n1. **Divide \\(\\sin^3 x\\) by \\(\\sin x\\):**  \n   Result: \\(\\sin^2 x\\)\n\n2. **Multiply \\(\\sin^2 x\\) by \\(\\sin x - 1\\):**  \n   \\(\\sin^3 x - \\sin^2 x\\)\n\n3. **Subtract from the original numerator:**  \n   \\((\\sin^3 x + 4 \\sin^2 x) - (\\sin^3 x - \\sin^2 x) = 5 \\sin^2 x\\)\n\n4. **Bring down the next term \\(\\sin x\\):**  \n   \\(5 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x\\)\n\n5. **Divide \\(5 \\sin^2 x\\) by \\(\\sin x\\):**  \n   Result: \\(5 \\sin x\\)\n\n6. **Multiply \\(5 \\sin x\\) by \\(\\sin x - 1\\):**  \n   \\(5 \\sin^2 x - 5 \\sin x\\)\n\n7. **Subtract from the current expression:**  \n   \\((5 \\sin^2 x + \\sin x) - (5 \\sin^2 x - 5 \\sin x) = 6 \\sin x\\)\n\n8. **Bring down the last term \\(-6\\):**  \n   \\(6 \\sin x - 6\\)\n\n9. **Divide \\(6 \\sin x\\) by \\(\\sin x\\):**  \n   Result: \\(6\\)\n\n10. **Multiply \\(6\\) by \\(\\sin x - 1\\):**  \n    \\(6 \\sin x - 6\\)\n\n11. **Subtract from the current expression:**  \n    \\((6 \\sin x - 6) - (6 \\sin x - 6) = 0\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe remainder is **zero**, which means \\(\\sin x - 1\\) is indeed a factor of the numerator. So, I can simplify the function by canceling out \\(\\sin x - 1\\) in both the numerator and denominator.\n\n**Simplified Function:**  \n\\[\nf(x) = \\sin^2 x + 5 \\sin x + 6\n\\]\n\nThis is much simpler! Now the function doesn't have a denominator, making it easier to analyze.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing the Simplified Function**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that we have:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sin^2 x + 5 \\sin x + 6\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the range of this function as \\(x\\) varies over all real numbers. Since \\(f(x)\\) is expressed in terms of \\(\\sin x\\), and we know that \\(-1 \\leq \\sin x \\leq 1\\), we can use this to determine the range of \\(f(x)\\).\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Find Minimum and Maximum Values:** Determine the extrema of \\(f(x)\\) within the allowed range of \\(\\sin x\\).\n2. **Graph the Function:** Visualize how \\(f(x)\\) behaves as \\(\\sin x\\) varies from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\).\n3. **Calculus Approach:** Use derivatives to find critical points and analyze concavity.\n\nI'll **start** by **finding the minimum and maximum values** of \\(f(x)\\) over the interval \\(-1 \\leq \\sin x \\leq 1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding Extrema**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo find the range, I need to identify the minimum and maximum values of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(\\sin x\\) varies within its possible range. This will give me the lowest and highest values that \\(f(x)\\) can attain.\n\n**Finding the Vertex of the Quadratic:**  \nSince \\(f(x)\\) is a quadratic function in terms of \\(\\sin x\\), I can find its vertex to determine the minimum or maximum value.\n\n**Writing it Out:**  \nThe function is:\n\n\\[\nf(t) = t^2 + 5t + 6\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(t = \\sin x\\).\n\n**Calculating the Vertex:**  \nThe vertex \\(t\\) of the quadratic \\(at^2 + bt + c\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nt = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{5}{2 \\cdot 1} = -\\frac{5}{2} = -2.5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nInteresting! The vertex occurs at \\(t = -2.5\\), but since \\(\\sin x\\) can only range from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\), this vertex is **outside** the allowable range. Therefore, the extrema must occur at the endpoints of the interval \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\).\n\n**Calculating \\(f(t)\\) at the Endpoints:**\n\n1. **At \\(t = -1\\):**\n\n\\[\nf(-1) = (-1)^2 + 5(-1) + 6 = 1 - 5 + 6 = 2\n\\]\n\n2. **At \\(t = 1\\):**\n\n\\[\nf(1) = (1)^2 + 5(1) + 6 = 1 + 5 + 6 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThus, the range of \\(f(x)\\) is from 2 to 12. But is it really? Let's think about it a bit more.\n\n**Wait, Let Me Double-Check:**  \nBefore finalizing, let's consider the original function's behavior, especially where \\(\\sin x = 1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Considering Points where \\(\\sin x = 1\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nInitially, we simplified the function by canceling out \\(\\sin x - 1\\). However, the original function is **undefined** at \\(\\sin x = 1\\) because the denominator becomes zero. This means that at those points, the function doesn't have a defined value, which might affect the range.\n\n**Possible Impact on the Range:**  \nAt \\(\\sin x = 1\\), the original function is undefined, but the simplified function \\(f(x) = \\sin^2 x + 5 \\sin x + 6\\) evaluates to:\n\n\\[\nf(1) = 1^2 + 5(1) + 6 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHowever, since \\(f(x)\\) is undefined at \\(\\sin x = 1\\), the value 12 is **not actually attained** by the original function.\n\n**Adjusting the Range:**  \nTherefore, while the simplified function suggests the range is \\([2, 12]\\), the original function never actually reaches 12 because it's undefined at \\(\\sin x = 1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Finalizing the Range**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTaking into account that \\(f(x)\\) is undefined at \\(\\sin x = 1\\), the maximum value of \\(f(x)\\) is **approaching** 12 but never actually equals 12. Thus, the range is from 2 to just below 12.\n\n**Writing it Out:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Range of } f(x) = [2, 12)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow, this feels correct. By considering the point where the function is undefined, we've ensured that the range accurately reflects the behavior of the original function.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThe range of the function \\(f(x)\\) is  \n\\[[2, 12)\\]  \nThis means that \\(f(x)\\) takes all values from 2 up to, but not including, 12.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n1. **Simplified the Function:**  \n   - Factored the numerator and canceled out the denominator, simplifying \\(f(x)\\) to a quadratic in terms of \\(\\sin x\\).\n\n2. **Found Extrema:**  \n   - Evaluated the simplified function at the endpoints of \\(\\sin x\\)'s range, obtaining minimum and maximum values.\n\n3. **Considered Points of Undefinedness:**  \n   - Acknowledged that the original function is undefined at \\(\\sin x = 1\\), which affects the upper bound of the range.\n\n4. **Finalized the Range:**  \n   - Adjusted the range to account for the point where \\(f(x)\\) is undefined, resulting in an open interval at the upper end.\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking for correctness, we've accurately determined the range of the function.\n\n---\n\nAnd there you have it! By taking a thoughtful and reflective approach, we ensured that our solution is both complete and correct.",
