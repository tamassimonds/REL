  "problem": "Forty cards are placed into a box, each bearing a number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, with each number entered on four cards. Four cards are drawn from the box at random and without replacement. Let $p$ be the probability that all four cards bear the same number. Let $q$ be the probability that three of the cards bear a number $a$ and the other bears a number $b$ that is not equal to $a$. What is the value of $q/p$?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probabilities \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) and then find the ratio \\( \\frac{q}{p} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\( p \\)\n\nThe probability \\( p \\) that all four drawn cards are of the same number can be computed as follows:\n\n1. **Total ways to draw 4 cards:** The number of ways to select 4 cards from a total of 40 cards is calculated using the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ways} = \\binom{40}{4} = \\frac{40!}{4!(40-4)!} = 91,390\n   \\]\n\n2. **Ways to draw 4 cards of the same number:** Since there are 10 distinct numbers (1 through 10) and exactly 4 cards for each number, there is only one way to choose all 4 cards for each number. Therefore, the total number of ways to draw 4 cards with the same number is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ways to draw all same} = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Probability \\( p \\):**\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{\\text{Ways to draw all same}}{\\text{Total ways}} = \\frac{10}{91,390}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate \\( q \\)\n\nThe probability \\( q \\) that three cards display one number \\( a \\) and the fourth card displays a different number \\( b \\) can be computed as follows:\n\n1. **Choosing the number \\( a \\):** For the number \\( a \\), there are 10 possible choices.\n\n2. **Choosing the different number \\( b \\):** Since \\( b \\) must differ from \\( a \\), there are 9 remaining choices for \\( b \\).\n\n3. **Choosing the cards:** \n   - From the 4 cards of number \\( a \\), we need to select 3:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ways to choose 3 cards of } a = \\binom{4}{3} = 4\n     \\]\n   - From the 4 cards of number \\( b \\), we select 1:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ways to choose 1 card of } b = \\binom{4}{1} = 4\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total combinations for \\( q \\):** Therefore, the total combinations of cards is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ways to choose 3 of } a \\text{ and 1 of } b = 10 \\times 9 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 1,440\n   \\]\n\n5. **Probability \\( q \\):**\n   \\[\n   q = \\frac{1440}{91,390}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the ratio \\( \\frac{q}{p} \\)\n\nNow we find the ratio:\n\\[\n\\frac{q}{p} = \\frac{\\frac{1440}{91,390}}{\\frac{10}{91,390}} = \\frac{1440}{10} = 144\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer to the problem is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{144}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The total number of ways that the numbers can be chosen is $\\binom{40}{4}.$ Exactly 10 of these possibilities result in the four cards having the same number.\n\nNow we need to determine the number of ways that three cards can have a number $a$ and the other card have a number $b$, with $b\\ne a$. There are $10\\cdot 9 = 90$  ways to choose the distinct numbers $a$ and $b$. (Notice that the order in which we choose these two number matters, since we get 3 of $a$ and 1 of $b$.)\n\nFor each value of $a$ there are $\\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose the three cards with $a$ and for each value of $b$ there are $\\binom{4}{1}$ ways to choose the card with $b$. Hence the number of ways that three cards have some  number $a$ and the other card has some distinct number $b$ is $$90\\cdot\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot\\binom{4}{1}=90\\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 = 1440.$$ So the probabilities $p$ and $q$ are $\\displaystyle \\frac{10}{\\binom{40}{4}}$ and $\\displaystyle \\frac{1440}{\\binom{40}{4}}$, respectively, which implies that $$\\frac{q}{p} = \\frac{1440}{10} = \\boxed{144}.$$"
