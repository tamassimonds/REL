  "solution": "To find the sum of all positive integers \\(n\\) such that their base \\(7\\) representation is the reverse of their base \\(16\\) representation, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Condition\nWe need numbers \\(n\\) where:\n- The representation of \\(n\\) in base \\(7\\) (let's denote its digits as \\(d_k d_{k-1} \\ldots d_0\\)) is the reverse of its representation in base \\(16\\) (denoted as \\(e_0 e_1 \\ldots e_m\\)).\nThis means:\n\\[ d_k d_{k-1} \\ldots d_0 = e_m e_{m-1} \\ldots e_0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Mathematical Representation\nFor a number \\(n\\), we represent it mathematically as:\n- In base \\(7\\):\n  \\[ n = d_0 \\cdot 7^0 + d_1 \\cdot 7^1 + d_2 \\cdot 7^2 + \\ldots + d_k \\cdot 7^k \\]\n- In base \\(16\\):\n  \\[ n = e_0 \\cdot 16^0 + e_1 \\cdot 16^1 + e_2 \\cdot 16^2 + \\ldots + e_m \\cdot 16^m \\]\n\n### Step 3: Search for Matches\nWe will test small integers to find matches:\n\n1. **For \\(n = 1\\)**:\n   - Base \\(7\\): \\(1\\)\n   - Base \\(16\\): \\(1\\)\n   - Match found.\n\n2. **For \\(n = 2\\)**:\n   - Base \\(7\\): \\(2\\)\n   - Base \\(16\\): \\(2\\)\n   - Match found.\n\n3. **For \\(n = 3\\)**:\n   - Base \\(7\\): \\(3\\)\n   - Base \\(16\\): \\(3\\)\n   - Match found.\n\n4. **For \\(n = 4\\)**:\n   - Base \\(7\\): \\(4\\)\n   - Base \\(16\\): \\(4\\)\n   - Match found.\n\n5. **For \\(n = 5\\)**:\n   - Base \\(7\\): \\(5\\)\n   - Base \\(16\\): \\(5\\)\n   - Match found.\n\n6. **For \\(n = 6\\)**:\n   - Base \\(7\\): \\(6\\)\n   - Base \\(16\\): \\(6\\)\n   - Match found.\n\n7. **For \\(n = 7\\)**:\n   - Base \\(7\\): \\(10\\)\n   - Base \\(16\\): \\(7\\)\n   - No match.\n\nContinuing this process, we continue testing integers until we find noteworthy values. \n\n### Step 4: Identify Additional Matches\nAfter checking values up to \\(37\\), we find:\n\n- **For \\(n = 37\\)**:\n  - Base \\(7\\): \\(52\\) (as \\(5 \\cdot 7 + 2\\))\n  - Base \\(16\\): \\(25\\) (as \\(2 \\cdot 16 + 5\\))\n  - The reverse relationship holds (reverse of \\(25\\) is \\(52\\) in base \\(7\\)).\n\n### Step 5: Summing the Valid Numbers\nThe valid integers found are:\n\\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 37 \\]\n\nWe compute the sum:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 37 = 58\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the sum of all positive integers \\(n\\) for which the base \\(7\\) representation is the reverse of the base \\(16\\) representation is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{58}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let the given base $7$ number be $n$. Suppose that $n$ has $d+1$ digits in either base $7$ or base $16$. Let $a_d$ be the leftmost digit of $n$ in its base $7$ expression, $a_{d-1}$ be the digit that is second from the left, and so forth, so that $a_0$ is the base $7$ units digit of $n$. It follows that $a_d$ is the base $16$ units digit of $n$, and so forth. Converting to base $10$, it follows that $$n = 7^d \\cdot a_d + 7^{d-1} \\cdot a_{d-1} + \\cdots + a_0 = 16^d \\cdot a_0 + 16^{d-1} \\cdot a_1 + \\cdots + a_d.$$Combining the like terms, it follows that $$(16^d - 1)a_0 + (16^{d-1} - 7)a_1 + \\cdots + (1 - 7^d)a_d = 0.$$For $d \\le 3$, we observe that the powers of $16$ are significantly larger than the powers of $7$. More precisely, since $a_i \\le 6$ for each $i$, then we have the following loose bound from the geometric series formula\n\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= (16^d - 1)a_0 + (16^{d-1} - 7)a_1 + \\cdots + (1 - 7^d)a_d \\\\\n&\\ge (16^d - 1) + (1 - 7) \\cdot 6 + \\cdots + (1-7^d) \\cdot 6 \\\\\n&= 16^d + d - 6 \\cdot \\frac{7^{d+1} - 1}{7 - 1} \\\\\n&\\ge 16^d - 7^{d+1} \\\\\n\\end{align*}For $d = 3$, then $16^3 = 4096 > 7^4 = 2401$, and by induction, $16^d > 7^{d+1}$ for all $d \\ge 3$. Thus, $d \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$. If $d = 0$, then all values will work, namely $n = 1,2,3,4,5,6$. If $d = 1$, then $$(16 - 1)a_0 + (1-7)a_1 = 15a_0 - 6a_1 = 3(5a_0 - 2a_1) = 0.$$Thus, $5a_0 = 2a_1$, so $5$ divides into $a_1$. As $a_1 \\le 6$, then $a_1 = 0,5$, but the former yields that $n = 0$. Thus, we discard it, giving us the number $n = 52_7 = 5 \\cdot 7 + 2 = 37$. For $d=2$, we obtain that $$(256 - 1)a_0 + (16 - 7)a_1 + (1 - 49)a_2 = 3(51a_0 + 3a_1 - 16a_2) = 0.$$Since $16a_2 \\le 6 \\cdot 16 = 96$, then $a_0 = 1$. Then, $51 + 3a_1 = 3(17 + a_1) = 16a_2$, so it follows that $a_2$ is divisible by $3$. Thus, $a_2 = 0,3,6$, but only $a_2 = 6$ is large enough. This yields that $a_1 = 15$, which is not possible in base $7$. Thus, the sum of the numbers satisfying the problem statement is equal to $1+2+3+4+5+6+37 = \\boxed{58}.$"
