  "problem": "A pirate is searching for buried treasure on 6 islands. On each island, there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that the island has buried treasure and no traps, a $\\frac{1}{12}$ chance that the island has traps but no treasure, and a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance that the island has neither traps nor treasure. What is the probability that while searching all 6 islands, the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure, and none with traps?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the probabilities of different types of islands:\n\n1. **Probability of an island having treasure and no traps:** \\( P(T) = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n2. **Probability of an island having traps and no treasure:** \\( P(R) = \\frac{1}{12} \\)\n3. **Probability of an island having neither traps nor treasure:** \\( P(N) = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n\nOur goal is to calculate the probability of encountering exactly 3 islands with treasure and 3 islands with neither treasure nor traps among 6 islands.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Probability of No Traps\nThe event of an island having no traps can occur if it has either treasure or is normal (neither treasure nor traps). Thus, we calculate the probability of an island having no traps:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{no traps}) = P(T) + P(N) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo combine these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 12:\n\n\\[\nP(T) = \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{12}, \\quad P(N) = \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{8}{12}\n\\]\n\nNow we can add:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{no traps}) = \\frac{3}{12} + \\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{11}{12}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Probability of No Treasure Given No Traps\nThe only situation that satisfies having no traps without treasure is being normal:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{no treasure | no traps}) = P(N) = \\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Probability of Exactly 3 Islands with Treasure\nLet \\( X \\) denote the number of islands with treasure. We are interested in the scenario where \\( X = 3 \\) (3 islands with treasure) and 0 islands with traps (which means the remaining islands are normal).\n\nUsing the binomial distribution, the number of ways to choose 3 islands from 6 for treasure is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe probability of choosing 3 islands with treasure and 3 islands with neither treasure nor traps is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = (P(T))^3 \\times (P(N))^3\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n\\[\n(P(T))^3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{64}\n\\]\n\\[\n(P(N))^3 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8}{27}\n\\]\n\nNow, we combine these probabilities:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{64} \\times \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{8}{1728} = \\frac{1}{216}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Total Probability\nFinally, we multiply by the number of ways to choose which 3 islands have treasure:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly 3 with treasure and 3 not with traps}) = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{216} = \\frac{20}{216} = \\frac{5}{54}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of encountering exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose 3 islands. For each of these choices, there is a probability of $\\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3$ that the chosen islands have treasure and the remaining ones have neither treasure nor traps. Therefore, the probability that the pirate encounters exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps is $20 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$."
