  "problem": "How many three-digit numbers are multiples of neither 5 nor 7?",
  "solution": "To determine how many three-digit numbers are multiples of neither 5 nor 7, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the range of three-digit numbers**: \n   The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of three-digit numbers**: \n   Total three-digit numbers = 999 - 100 + 1 = 900.\n\n3. **Find the number of three-digit multiples of 5**: \n   - The smallest three-digit multiple of 5 is 100, and the largest is 995.\n   - These multiples form an arithmetic sequence: 100, 105, 110, ..., 995 with a common difference of 5.\n   - To find the count of terms (n), we use the nth term formula of an arithmetic sequence:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a + (n-1)d \n     \\]\n     Setting \\( a = 100 \\), \\( d = 5 \\), and \\( a_n = 995 \\):\n     \\[\n     995 = 100 + (n-1) \\cdot 5 \n     \\]\n     Solving this gives \\( n = 180 \\). Therefore, there are 180 three-digit multiples of 5.\n\n4. **Find the number of three-digit multiples of 7**: \n   - The smallest three-digit multiple of 7 is 105, and the largest is 994.\n   - These also form an arithmetic sequence: 105, 112, 119, ..., 994 with a common difference of 7.\n   - Using the nth term formula:\n     \\[\n     994 = 105 + (n-1) \\cdot 7 \n     \\]\n     Solving this gives \\( n = 128 \\). Thus, there are 128 three-digit multiples of 7.\n\n5. **Find the number of three-digit multiples of both 5 and 7 (i.e., multiples of 35)**:\n   - The smallest three-digit multiple of 35 is 105 and the largest is 980.\n   - This forms an arithmetic sequence: 105, 140, 175, ..., 980 with a common difference of 35.\n   - Using the nth term formula:\n     \\[\n     980 = 105 + (n-1) \\cdot 35 \n     \\]\n     Solving this gives \\( n = 26 \\). Therefore, there are 26 three-digit multiples of both 5 and 7.\n\n6. **Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion**:\n   To find the total number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of either 5 or 7, we use:\n   \\[\n   |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B| \n   \\]\n   where \\( |A| = 180 \\) (multiples of 5), \\( |B| = 128 \\) (multiples of 7), and \\( |A \\cap B| = 26 \\) (multiples of both).\n   \\[\n   |A \\cup B| = 180 + 128 - 26 = 282 \n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7} = \\text{Total three-digit numbers} - |A \\cup B| \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 900 - 282 = 618 \n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of three-digit numbers that are multiples of neither 5 nor 7 is **618**.",
  "ground_truth": "It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 5 or 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \\times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 that is a three-digit number is $142 \\times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers that are multiples of 7.  The smallest multiple of 5 that is a three-digit number is $20\\times 5 = 100$, and the largest multiple of 5 that is a three digit number is $199\\times 5 =995$. So there are $199-20+1=180$ multiples of 5.\n\nNow notice that we have counted some numbers twice: those multiples of $5\\times7=35$. The smallest multiple of 35 is $3\\times 35 = 105$, the largest multiple of 35 is $28\\times35 =980$. So there are $28-3+1=26$ multiples of 35.\n\nWe have 128 multiples of 7 and 180 multiples of 5, but we count 26 multiples twice.  So, there are a total of $128+180-26 = 282$ distinct three-digit numbers that are multiples of 5 or 7 (or both).   There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-282=\\boxed{618}$ three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 nor 5."
