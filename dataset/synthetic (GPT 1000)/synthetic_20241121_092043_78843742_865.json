  "problem": "Call an integer $n$ oddly powerful if there exist positive integers $a$ and $b$, where $b>1$, $b$ is odd, and $a^b = n$. How many oddly powerful integers are less than $2010$?",
  "solution": "To find the number of oddly powerful integers less than 2010, we are looking for integers \\( n \\) that can be represented as \\( n = a^b \\), where \\( a \\) is a positive integer, \\( b \\) is an odd integer greater than 1, and \\( n < 2010 \\). The approach to identify these integers is as follows:\n\n1. **Identify Possible Odd Exponents \\( b \\)**: The smallest odd integers are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, etc. For each odd \\( b \\), we\u2019ll determine the maximum integer \\( a \\) such that \\( a^b < 2010 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Maximum \\( a \\) for Each \\( b \\)**:\n   - **For \\( b = 3 \\)**: \n     \\[\n     a < \\sqrt[3]{2010} \\approx 12.63 \\implies a = 1 \\text{ to } 12 \\text{ (12 values)}\n     \\]\n     Powers: \\( 1^3, 2^3, \\ldots, 12^3 \\rightarrow \\{1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1331, 1728\\} \\)\n   \n   - **For \\( b = 5 \\)**: \n     \\[\n     a < \\sqrt[5]{2010} \\approx 4.57 \\implies a = 1 \\text{ to } 4 \\text{ (4 values)}\n     \\]\n     Powers: \\( 1^5, 2^5, 3^5, 4^5 \\rightarrow \\{1, 32, 243, 1024\\} \\)\n\n   - **For \\( b = 7 \\)**: \n     \\[\n     a < \\sqrt[7]{2010} \\approx 3.78 \\implies a = 1 \\text{ to } 3 \\text{ (3 values)}\n     \\]\n     Powers: \\( 1^7, 2^7, 3^7 \\rightarrow \\{1, 128\\} \\) (2187 exceeds 2010)\n\n   - **For \\( b = 9 \\)**: \n     \\[\n     a < \\sqrt[9]{2010} \\approx 2.54 \\implies a = 1 \\text{ to } 2 \\text{ (2 values)}\n     \\]\n     Powers: \\( 1^9, 2^9 \\rightarrow \\{1, 512\\} \\)\n\n   - **For \\( b = 11 \\)**: \n     \\[\n     a < \\sqrt[11]{2010} \\approx 2.34 \\implies a = 1 \\text{ (1 value)}\n     \\]\n     Powers: \\( 1^{11} \\rightarrow \\{1\\} \\)\n\n3. **Compile All Unique Powers**: \n   - From \\( b=3 \\): {1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1331, 1728}\n   - From \\( b=5 \\): {1, 32, 243, 1024}\n   - From \\( b=7 \\): {1, 128}\n   - From \\( b=9 \\): {1, 512}\n   - From \\( b=11 \\): {1}\n\n4. **Combine and Remove Duplicates**: The unique oddly powerful integers obtained are:\n   \\[\n   \\{1, 8, 27, 32, 64, 125, 128, 216, 243, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1024, 1331, 1728\\}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Count These Integers**: Upon tallying, we find there are 16 unique oddly powerful integers less than 2010.\n\nThus, the total count of oddly powerful integers less than 2010 is \n\\[\n\\text{Total count} = 16.\n\\]\nThe final answer is:\n<16> solution</16>",
  "ground_truth": "Let us first determine the number of cubes that are less than $2010$. We have $10^3 = 1000$, $11^3 = 1331$, and $12^3 = 1728$, but $13^3 = 2197$. So there are $12$ cubes less than $2010$. As for fifth powers, $4^5 = 1024$, but $5^5 = 3125$. There are $4$ fifth powers less than $2010$, but only $3$ of these have not already been included, since we've already counted 1. Analyzing seventh powers, $3^7 = 2187$, so the only new seventh power less than $2010$ is $2^7$. There are no new ninth powers since they are all cubes, and $2^{11} = 2048$ is greater than 2010. Therefore, there are $12+3+1 = \\boxed{16}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$."
