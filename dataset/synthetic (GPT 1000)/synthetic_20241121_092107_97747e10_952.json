  "problem": "Billy Goats invested some money in stocks and bonds. The total amount he invested was $\\$165,\\!000$. If he invested 4.5 times as much in stocks as he did in bonds, what was his total investment in stocks?",
  "solution": "To solve the investment allocation problem for Billy Goats, we proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( B \\) represent the amount Billy invested in bonds.\n   - Since he invested 4.5 times more in stocks than in bonds, we can express the investment in stocks as \\( S = 4.5B \\).\n\n2. **Equation Setup:**\n   - We know the total investment amounts to \\$165,000, leading to the equation:\n   \\[\n   B + S = 165,000\n   \\]\n   By substituting \\( S \\) with \\( 4.5B \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   B + 4.5B = 165,000\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   5.5B = 165,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for Bonds:**\n   - To find \\( B \\), we divide both sides by 5.5:\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{165,000}{5.5} = 30,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Investment in Stocks:**\n   - Now we can substitute \\( B \\) back to find \\( S \\):\n   \\[\n   S = 4.5B = 4.5 \\times 30,000 = 135,000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The total amount invested in bonds is \\$30,000, while the total invested in stocks is \\$135,000.\n\nIn summary:\n- Amount invested in bonds: \\$30,000\n- Amount invested in stocks: \\$135,000\n\nThus, the total amount Billy invested in stocks is:\n\n<ANSWER>135,000 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let the amount of money Billy invested in bonds be $s.$ Then, the amount of money he invested in stocks is $4.5s.$ The total amount of money he invested is $s+4.5s=5.5s=165,\\!000.$ Thus, $s=\\frac{165,\\!000}{5.5}=30,\\!000.$ Finally, the amount invested in stocks is $4.5s=4.5\\cdot30,\\!000=\\boxed{135,\\!000}$ dollars."
