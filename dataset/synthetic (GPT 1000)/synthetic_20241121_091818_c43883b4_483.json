  "problem": "A wheel with radius $1\\text{ m}$ is rolled in a straight line through one complete revolution on a flat horizontal surface. How many meters did the center of the wheel travel horizontally from its starting location?",
  "solution": "To determine how far the center of a wheel with a radius of 1 meter travels after one complete revolution, we can follow these straightforward steps:\n\n1. **Relationship between the wheel and distance traveled**: \n   - When a wheel rolls without slipping, the distance traveled by the wheel on the ground corresponds to its circumference.\n\n2. **Calculate the circumference of the wheel**: \n   - The circumference \\(C\\) is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     C = 2 \\pi r\n     \\]\n   - Given the radius \\(r = 1\\text{ m}\\), we substitute this value:\n     \\[\n     C = 2 \\pi \\times 1\\text{ m} = 2\\pi\\text{ m}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Distance traveled by the center of the wheel**: \n   - As the wheel completes one full revolution, the point touching the ground moves a distance equal to the circumference, \\(2\\pi\\text{ m}\\). The center of the wheel, which is directly above this point and remains a constant distance (equal to the radius) above it, also travels this same horizontal distance of \\(2\\pi\\text{ m}\\).\n\nIn conclusion, the distance that the center of the wheel travels after one complete revolution is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = 2\\pi \\text{ m}\n\\]\n\nThus, the clear final answer is: <ANSWER>2\\pi \\text{ meters} solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We begin by considering a point $P$ which is where the circle first touches a line $L.$\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(20,0),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw(circle((5,3),3),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw(circle((15,3),3),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((5,0)--(5,3),black+linewidth(1)+dashed);\ndraw((5,3)--(15,3),black+linewidth(1)+dashed);\ndraw((15,3)--(15,0),black+linewidth(1)+dashed);\nlabel(\"$L$\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"$P$\",(5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(5,3),W);\nlabel(\"$P'$\",(15,0),S);\nlabel(\"$C'$\",(15,3),E);\n[/asy]\n\nIf a circle makes one complete revolution, the point $P$ moves to $P'$ and the distance $PP'$ is the circumference of the circle, or $2 \\pi\\text{ m}.$\n\nIf we now complete the rectangle, we can see that the distance the center travels is $CC'$ which is exactly equal to $PP'$ or $\\boxed{2 \\pi}$ meters."
