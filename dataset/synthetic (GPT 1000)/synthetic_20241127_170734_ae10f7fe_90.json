  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, reflecting and brainstorming along the way, just like I would naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we have three non-zero integers \\( p, q, r \\) such that:\n\n\\[\np + q + r = 26\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} + \\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{360}{pqr} = 1\n\\]\n\nWe need to compute \\( pqr \\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis looks like a problem involving both sums and reciprocals of integers. It reminds me of problems where symmetric properties or Vieta's formulas might come in handy because of the sum and product relationships. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start\u2014there's a mix of linear and reciprocal terms that's a bit tricky.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use Vieta\u2019s Formulas:**  \n   Since \\( p, q, r \\) are roots of a polynomial, maybe we can construct such a polynomial and find relationships.\n\n2. **Transform the Reciprocal Equation:**  \n   Perhaps multiplying through by \\( pqr \\) would simplify the reciprocal terms.\n\n3. **Assume Specific Values:**  \n   Maybe assume some values for \\( p, q, r \\) that satisfy the sum and check if they fit the second equation.\n\n4. **Symmetric Properties:**  \n   Utilize the symmetry in the equations to find relationships between \\( p, q, r \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet me start by trying to transform the reciprocal equation because dealing with reciprocals can often be simplified by eliminating denominators. If that doesn't work, I can pivot to another strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Transform the Reciprocal Equation**\n\nLet's try to eliminate the fractions by multiplying both sides of the second equation by \\( pqr \\):\n\n\\[\npqr \\left( \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} + \\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{360}{pqr} \\right) = pqr \\cdot 1\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nqr + pr + pq + 360 = pqr\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, now we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( p + q + r = 26 \\)\n2. \\( qr + pr + pq + 360 = pqr \\)\n\nThis looks better because we've eliminated the fractions. It reminds me of symmetric sums that appear in polynomial roots. Maybe we're on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Connect with Symmetric Sums**\n\nFrom Vieta\u2019s formulas, for roots \\( p, q, r \\) of a polynomial:\n\n- The sum \\( p + q + r = 26 \\)\n- The sum of products taken two at a time \\( pq + qr + pr = ? \\)\n- The product \\( pqr = ? \\)\n\n**Equation Setup:**  \nWe can set up a cubic polynomial:\n\n\\[\nx^3 - (p+q+r)x^2 + (pq+qr+pr)x - pqr = 0\n\\]\n\nPlugging in what we know:\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 26x^2 + (pq + qr + pr)x - pqr = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf we can express \\( pq + qr + pr \\) in terms of known quantities, we might be able to find \\( pqr \\). But wait, we already have an expression involving \\( pq + qr + pr \\) from our second equation:\n\n\\[\nqr + pr + pq + 360 = pqr \\Rightarrow pq + qr + pr = pqr - 360\n\\]\n\nSo, we can substitute that back into our polynomial equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Substitute Back into the Polynomial**\n\nReplacing \\( pq + qr + pr \\) in the polynomial:\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 26x^2 + (pqr - 360)x - pqr = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis substitution feels correct, but I'm still not seeing a clear path to solving for \\( pqr \\). Maybe I need another approach or more information. Perhaps assuming specific values could help verify if this setup works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Assume Specific Values for \\( p, q, r \\)**\n\n**Approach:**  \nLet's assume \\( p, q, r \\) are distinct integers that sum to 26. Maybe start with small integers and see if they satisfy both equations.\n\n**Assumption:**  \nLet\u2019s try \\( p = 6, q = 8, r = 12 \\).\n\n**Check Sum:**  \n\\[ 6 + 8 + 12 = 26 \\]  \nOkay, the first equation is satisfied.\n\n**Compute Reciprocal Equation:**  \nLet\u2019s compute the left side of the second equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{360}{6 \\times 8 \\times 12}\n\\]\n\n**Compute Each Term:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} = 0.1667,\\ \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125,\\ \\frac{1}{12} = 0.0833\n\\]\n\nAdding these:\n\n\\[\n0.1667 + 0.125 + 0.0833 = 0.375\n\\]\n\nNow, compute \\( pqr = 6 \\times 8 \\times 12 = 576 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{360}{576} = 0.625\n\\]\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n\\[\n0.375 + 0.625 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWow, it works! So, \\( p = 6, q = 8, r = 12 \\) satisfies both equations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGiven that these values satisfy both equations, we can compute \\( pqr \\):\n\n\\[\npqr = 6 \\times 8 \\times 12 = 576\n\\]\n\n**",
  "ground_truth": "\\begin{align*} \\frac {1}{p} + \\frac {1}{q} + \\frac {1}{r} + \\frac {360}{pqr} & = 1 \\\\ pq + pr + qr + 360 & =  pqr \\\\ 360 & =  pqr - pq - pr - qr \\\\  & =  (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) - (p + q + r) + 1 \\\\  & =  (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) - 25 \\\\ 385 & =  (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \\\\ \\end{align*}\nFrom here, you can factor $385$ as $5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11$, giving corresponding values of $6, 8,$ and $12$. The answer is $6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 12=\\boxed{576}$."
