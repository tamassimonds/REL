  "solution": "To calculate the probability that an ant is at dot \\( B \\) after 5 moves, we can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\nThe ant begins at point \\( A \\) with coordinates \\( (0,0) \\) and aims to reach point \\( B \\) at \\( (0,1) \\). The ant can move in four directions: right to \\( (1,0) \\), left to \\( (-1,0) \\), up to \\( (0,1) \\), and down to \\( (0,-1) \\).\n\n### 2. Analyzing Movement and Colors\nThe points can be classified by colors based on the sum of their coordinates:\n- Red if \\( x+y \\) is even (e.g., \\( A \\) at \\( (0,0) \\))\n- Blue if \\( x+y \\) is odd (e.g., \\( B \\) at \\( (0,1) \\))\n\nSince \\( A \\) is red, the ant can only move to blue points on its first move. After an odd number of moves, the ant will be on a blue point, and after an even number, it will be back on a red point.\n\n### 3. Path Requirements\nTo reach \\( B \\) after 5 moves:\n- The ant must end up on a blue point (which \\( B \\) is).\n- The ant must make an odd number of vertical moves, indicating it will move up to \\( B \\) once and must account for downward moves.\n\n### 4. Move Analysis\nLet\u2019s represent the moves:\n- \\( U \\): Up moves\n- \\( D \\): Down moves\n- \\( L \\): Left moves\n- \\( R \\): Right moves\n\nTo reach \\( B \\) effectively:\n- \\( U = 1 \\) (one move up to \\( B \\))\n- \\( D = 3 \\) (to compensate for the upward move)\n- The total moves must sum to \\( 5 \\): \\( U + D + L + R = 5 \\).\n\nThis setup implies:\n1 up move, 3 down moves, and hence the remaining move must adjust with left or right.\n\n### 5. Counting Paths\nThe arrangements of the moves can be calculated as follows:\n- The sequence consists of 1 up move, 3 down moves, and any combination of left and right moves to fill the remaining positions up to 5 moves.\n\n### 6. Total Possibilities\nTo find paths leading to \\( B \\), we calculate the number of unique arrangements of moves. Since the paths can consist of variations of \\( U, D, L, \\) and \\( R \\), we can use combinatorial counting.\n\nFor every set of 5 moves, the ant can land on various blue points. Ultimately, it was found that there are 4 blue endpoints possible after 5 moves.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe total probability of the ant reaching \\( B \\) after 5 moves is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{1 \\text{ (successful path to B)}}{4 \\text{ (total possible blue endpoints)}}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that the ant is at dot \\( B \\) after 5 moves is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Color the dots red and blue as shown below. Notice that whenever the ant moves, it moves from a red dot to a blue dot or a blue dot to a red dot. So since $A$ is a red dot, it must move to a blue dot, then a red dot, then a blue dot, then a red dot, and end up on a blue dot. There are only four blue dots, and the ant is equally likely to end up on any one of these four, since the diagram is symmetric to a $90^\\circ$ rotation. The probability that the ant ends on $B$ after five minutes is therefore $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.
