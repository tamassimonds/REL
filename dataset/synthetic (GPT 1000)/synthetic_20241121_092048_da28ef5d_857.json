  "problem": "Let $p$ be the largest prime with 2010 digits. What is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $p^2 - k$ is divisible by 12?",
  "solution": "To find the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( p^2 - k \\) is divisible by 12, where \\( p \\) is the largest prime with 2010 digits, we can analyze the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Understanding \\( p \\)**:\n   - Since \\( p \\) is an odd prime, it can be expressed as \\( p = 2n + 1 \\) for some integer \\( n \\). Consequently, we know that \\( p \\equiv 1 \\) or \\( p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\).\n   - The square of \\( p \\) is calculated as follows:\n     - If \\( p \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\), then \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\).\n     - If \\( p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\), then \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\).\n   - Therefore, for both cases, we can conclude:\n     \\[\n     p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Divisibility by 3**:\n   - An odd prime \\( p \\) can be either \\( 1 \\mod 3 \\) or \\( 2 \\mod 3 \\):\n     - If \\( p \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\), then \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\).\n     - If \\( p \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\), then \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\).\n   - Thus, we find that in both scenarios:\n     \\[\n     p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Combining results**:\n   - We now have:\n     \\[\n     p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\n     \\]\n   - Applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we conclude:\n     \\[\n     p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 12.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Finding \\( k \\)**:\n   - The condition \\( p^2 - k \\equiv 0 \\mod 12 \\) leads to:\n     \\[\n     p^2 \\equiv k \\mod 12.\n     \\]\n   - Since we established \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 12 \\), it follows that:\n     \\[\n     k \\equiv 1 \\mod 12.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determining the smallest positive integer \\( k \\)**:\n   - The smallest positive integer satisfying \\( k \\equiv 1 \\mod 12 \\) is \\( k = 1 \\).\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( p^2 - k \\) is divisible by 12 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let us iterate over larger and larger positive integers for $k$. If $k=1$, then $p^2-k = p^2-1 = (p+1)(p-1)$. Since $p$ is odd, both $p+1$ and $p-1$ are even, so therefore $p^2-1$ is divisible by 4. Also, since $p$ is not divisible by 3, then $p$ must either be one greater or two greater than a multiple of 3, which means that $p-1$ or $p+1$ is divisible by 3, respectively. As a result, $p^2-1$ is divisible by both 3 and 4, so it is divisible by 12. Therefore, we have $\\boxed{k = 1}$."
