  "solution": "Absolutely, let's consolidate the solution into a coherent and complete narrative while maintaining the original thinking process. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, the problem asks us to find all values of \\( c \\) that satisfy the compound inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{3} \\le 2 + c < -2(1 + c)\n\\]\n\nAt first glance, this is a two-part inequality involving \\( c \\). We need to determine the range of \\( c \\) that satisfies both inequalities simultaneously. To tackle this, let's brainstorm some strategies.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Solve Each Inequality Separately:** We could solve the left inequality (\\(\\frac{c}{3} \\le 2 + c\\)) and the right inequality (\\(2 + c < -2(1 + c)\\)) individually, then find where their solutions overlap.\n\n2. **Combine the Inequalities:** Alternatively, we could attempt to merge the inequalities into a single expression and solve for \\( c \\) directly.\n\n3. **Graphical Approach:** Visualizing the inequalities on a number line might help us see the overlapping regions.\n\nGiven these options, starting with the **first strategy**\u2014solving each inequality separately\u2014seems straightforward. If it doesn't yield a clear solution, we can pivot to another method.\n\n### **Step 1: Solving the Left Inequality \\(\\frac{c}{3} \\le 2 + c\\)**\n\nLet's focus on the left inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{3} \\le 2 + c\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- We need to isolate \\( c \\) to find its range.\n- Subtracting \\( c \\) from both sides might simplify things.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{3} - c \\le 2\n\\]\n\nTo combine the \\( c \\) terms, let's express \\( c \\) with a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{3} - \\frac{3c}{3} = \\frac{-2c}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the inequality becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-2c}{3} \\le 2\n\\]\n\n**Next Step:**\n- To isolate \\( c \\), multiply both sides by \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n- Remember, multiplying by a negative flips the inequality sign.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nc \\ge 2 \\times \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = -3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Multiplying both sides by a negative correctly flipped the inequality sign.\n- The solution \\( c \\ge -3 \\) makes sense.\n\n**Solution for the Left Inequality:**\n\n\\[\nc \\ge -3\n\\]\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Right Inequality \\(2 + c < -2(1 + c)\\)**\n\nNext, let's tackle the right inequality:\n\n\\[\n2 + c < -2(1 + c)\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Distributing the \\(-2\\) on the right side will simplify the expression.\n- Then, we'll isolate \\( c \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nFirst, distribute \\(-2\\):\n\n\\[\n2 + c < -2 - 2c\n\\]\n\n**Next Step:**\n- Add \\( 2c \\) to both sides to bring all \\( c \\) terms to one side.\n\n\\[\n2 + c + 2c < -2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2 + 3c < -2\n\\]\n\n**Next Step:**\n- Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the \\( 3c \\) term.\n\n\\[\n3c < -4\n\\]\n\n**Final Step:**\n- Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\( c \\).\n\n\\[\nc < \\frac{-4}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The steps followed correctly isolate \\( c \\).\n- No negative multiplication or division involved, so the inequality sign remains unchanged.\n\n**Solution for the Right Inequality:**\n\n\\[\nc < -\\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n### **Step 3: Combining Both Inequalities**\n\nNow, we have two inequalities:\n\n\\[\nc \\ge -3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c < -\\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- We need values of \\( c \\) that satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n- This means finding the intersection of these two ranges.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- The first inequality (\\(c \\ge -3\\)) includes all \\( c \\) from \\(-3\\) onwards.\n- The second inequality (\\(c < -\\frac{4}{3}\\)) includes all \\( c \\) less than \\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\).\n\n**Intersection:**\n\n\\[\n-3 \\le c < -\\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The interval \\([-3, -\\frac{4}{3})\\) captures all \\( c \\) values that satisfy both inequalities.\n- This makes sense because \\( c \\) needs to be greater than or equal to \\(-3\\) and less than \\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\).\n\n### **Step 4: Expressing the Solution in Interval Notation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- We'll write the solution as an interval.\n- Since \\(-3\\) is included (\\(\\le\\)), we'll use a square bracket.\n- \\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\) is not included (\\(<\\)), so we'll use a parenthesis.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n<c>\\solution{-3 \\le c < -\\frac{4}{3} \\quad \\text{or in interval notation:} \\quad [-3, -\\frac{4}{3})}</ANSWER>\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The solution is correctly expressed in interval notation.\n- Double-checking each step confirms that no errors were made along the way.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **First Strategy Success:** Solving each inequality separately and then finding their intersection was effective.\n- **Check and Reflect:** Regularly checking each step ensured accuracy and helped catch any potential mistakes early.\n- **Clear Communication:** Expressing the final answer in interval notation clearly conveys the range of \\( c \\) that satisfies the compound inequality.\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically, exploring different strategies, and frequently reflecting on each step's correctness, we arrived at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\nThat's it!

  "ground_truth": "We have two inequalities which $c$ must satisfy. We consider these inequalities one at a time.\n\nThe first inequality is $\\frac{c}{3}\\le 2+c$. Multiplying both sides by $3$, we have $$c\\le 6+3c.$$Subtracting $3c$ from both sides gives $$-2c\\le 6.$$We can divide both sides by $-2$, but we must reverse the inequality since $-2$ is negative. This gives $c\\ge -3$.\n\nThe second inequality is $2+c < -2(1+c)$. Expanding the right side, we have $$2+c < -2-2c.$$Adding $2c-2$ to both sides gives $$3c<-4.$$Dividing both sides by $3$ gives $c<-\\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nSo, all $c$ which satisfy both inequalities are given by $-3\\le c<-\\frac{4}{3}$, or, in interval notation, $c\\in\\boxed{\\left[-3,-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)}$."
