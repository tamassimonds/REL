  "problem": "How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit?",
  "solution": "To determine how many of the first 343 smallest positive integers contain the digits 4 or 5 when represented in base 7, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the range of numbers\nThe number 343 in decimal is equivalent to \\(7^3\\). Thus, we will consider numbers ranging from 1 to 342. In base 7, this includes all integers from \\(1_7\\) to \\(666_7\\), involving up to 3 digits.\n\n### Step 2: Count the total possibilities\nIn base 7:\n- **Three-digit numbers** (from \\(100_7\\) to \\(666_7\\)):\n  - First digit (1-6): 6 options.\n  - Second digit (0-6): 7 options.\n  - Third digit (0-6): 7 options.\n  - Total: \\(6 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 294\\).\n\n- **Two-digit numbers** (from \\(10_7\\) to \\(66_7\\)):\n  - First digit (1-6): 6 options.\n  - Second digit (0-6): 7 options.\n  - Total: \\(6 \\times 7 = 42\\).\n\n- **One-digit numbers** (from \\(1_7\\) to \\(6_7\\)): 6 options (1-6).\n\nAdding these results together gives the total number of positive integers from 1 to 342:\n\\[\n294 + 42 + 6 = 342.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Count numbers that do not contain 4 or 5\nNow we need to count the numbers that do not use the digits 4 or 5. The remaining valid digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\n- **Three-digit numbers** (not containing 4 or 5):\n  - First digit (1, 2, 3, 6): 4 options.\n  - Second digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 6): 5 options.\n  - Third digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 6): 5 options.\n  - Total: \\(4 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 100\\).\n\n- **Two-digit numbers**:\n  - First digit (1, 2, 3, 6): 4 options.\n  - Second digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 6): 5 options.\n  - Total: \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\).\n\n- **One-digit numbers** (1, 2, 3, 6): 4 options.\n\nAdding these results gives the total count of positive integers that do not include the digits 4 or 5:\n\\[\n100 + 20 + 4 = 124.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate those that contain 4 or 5\nTo determine how many numbers include at least one of the digits 4 or 5, we subtract the count of numbers without 4 or 5 from the total count of positive integers:\n\\[\n342 - 124 = 218.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe total number of the first 343 smallest positive integers, when represented in base 7, that contain either the digits 4 or 5 (or both) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{218}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "$343 = 7^3 = 1000_7$, so the first 343 natural numbers in base 7 are $1_7, 2_7, \\ldots 1000_7$.  Any number in this list that neither includes 4 or 5 only includes the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6.  If we replace 6 with 4, these have the same decimal expansions as the integers in base 5.  Since there are $5^3 = 125$ positive integers less than or equal to $1000_5$, there are 125 integers less than or equal to $1000_7$ that contain no 4's or 5's in base 7, which means there are $343 - 125 = \\boxed{218}$ integers that include a 4 or a 5."
