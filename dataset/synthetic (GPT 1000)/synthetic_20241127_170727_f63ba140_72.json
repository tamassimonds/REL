  "problem": "The Little Twelve Basketball Conference has two divisions, with six teams in each division. Each team plays each of the other teams in its own division twice and every team in the other division once. How many conference games are scheduled?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were working it out manually, exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and ensuring everything checks out before arriving at the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, so we've got a basketball conference with two divisions, each containing six teams. The games are scheduled as follows:\n\n- **Within each division:** Every team plays the other teams **twice** (home and away).\n- **Between divisions:** Each team plays every team in the other division **once**.\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**  \nThis setup reminds me of scheduling problems involving combinations. My first instinct is to calculate the number of games within each division and then add the games played between divisions. But before settling on this, let me explore a few strategies to ensure I\u2019m on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate Games Within Each Division Separately**\n2. **Calculate Games Between Divisions**\n3. **Sum Both to Get the Total Number of Games**\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nAnother method could be to calculate the total games for one team and then multiply, but that might lead to double-counting since each game involves two teams. I need to be careful about overcounting here.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAfter considering the alternatives, I think calculating within and between divisions separately makes the most sense. It\u2019s straightforward and minimizes the risk of errors. Let's proceed with this strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Games Within Each Division**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEach team plays every other team in its division twice (home and away). So, I need to figure out how many unique matchups there are in one division and then account for the double round-robin format.\n\n**Brainstorm:**  \nThis sounds like a combinations problem where I need to find all unique pairs of teams. I\u2019ll use the combination formula to determine the number of unique matchups.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Number of Teams in One Division:** 6\n- **Unique Pairs (Matchups):**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{C}(6, 2) = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15\n  \\]\n- **Games Played Twice (Home and Away):**  \n  \\[\n  15 \\times 2 = 30 \\text{ games per division}\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nThere are 15 unique pairs in a group of 6 teams, and playing each matchup twice makes it 30 games. This feels right.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nYep, that seems correct. So, there are **30 games** within each division.\n\n**Total for Both Divisions:**  \n\\[\n30 \\times 2 = 60 \\text{ games}\n\\]\n\n**Check Again:**  \nSince each division operates independently, calculating them separately and then summing makes sense. No overcounting here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Games Between Divisions**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, each team plays every team in the other division once. I need to find the total number of these cross-division games.\n\n**Brainstorm:**  \nWith 6 teams in each division, each team in Division A plays 6 teams in Division B. This creates a total of 6 matches per team in one division.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Teams in Each Division:** 6\n- **Cross-Division Games per Team:** 6\n- **Total Cross-Division Games:**  \n  \\[\n  6 \\times 6 = 36 \\text{ games}\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nBy multiplying the number of teams in one division by the number of teams in the other, I account for all cross-division matchups. This seems correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nYes, that looks good. There are **36 games** between the two divisions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Summing Both Parts to Get Total Games**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo find the total number of conference games, I need to add the games within each division to the cross-division games.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Total Within Divisions:** 60 games\n- **Total Cross-Division:** 36 games\n- **Overall Total:**  \n  \\[\n  60 + 36 = 96 \\text{ games}\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nAdding the two separate components (within and between divisions) ensures that all games are counted without overlap. This makes sense.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything adds up correctly. The total number of conference games is **96**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Does This Make Sense?**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, I want to ensure there\u2019s no overcounting or undercounting. Each game should be counted once, and all possible matchups should be covered.\n\n- **Within each division:** Each team plays all others twice.\n- **Between divisions:** Each team plays all teams in the other division once.\n\n**Random Insight:**  \nInitially, I considered calculating each team's total games individually, but that approach risked double-counting shared games. Sticking with separate calculations for within and between divisions is safer and more straightforward.\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nThis method is robust and straightforward. No errors in calculations, and all matchups are accounted for. I\u2019m confident that the total number of conference games is **96**.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>96 conference games scheduled solution</ANSWER>**\n\n\u2014\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Within Each Division:**  \n  - 30 games per division  \n  - Total for both divisions:  \n    \\[\n    30 \\times 2 = 60 \\text{ games}\n    \\]\n\n- **Between Divisions:**  \n  - Total cross-division games:  \n    \\[\n    6 \\times 6 = 36 \\text{ games}\n    \\]\n\n- **Total Conference Games:**  \n  \\[\n  60 + 36 = 96 \\text{ games}\n  \\]\n\nBy carefully breaking down the problem, exploring different strategies, and verifying each step, we've determined that there are **96 conference games scheduled**.",
  "ground_truth": "Each team plays 10 games in its own division and 6 games against teams in the other division. So each of the 12 teams plays 16 conference games. Because each game involves two teams, there are $\\frac{12\\times 16}{2}=\\boxed{96}$ games scheduled."
