  "problem": "What is the smallest integer $n$, greater than $1$, such that $n^{-1}\\pmod{1050}$ is defined?",
  "solution": "To find the smallest integer \\( n \\) greater than 1 such that \\( n^{-1} \\mod{1050} \\) is defined, we need \\( n \\) to be coprime to \\( 1050 \\). Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of \\( 1050 \\)**:\n   - We begin by factorizing \\( 1050 \\). \n   - \\( 1050 = 105 \\times 10 \\).\n   - Further breaking this down: \n     - \\( 105 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\)\n     - \\( 10 = 2 \\times 5 \\)\n   - Therefore, the complete prime factorization of \\( 1050 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   1050 = 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understanding Coprimeness**:\n   - For \\( n \\) to be coprime to \\( 1050 \\), it must not be divisible by any of its prime factors, which are \\( 2, 3, 5, \\) and \\( 7 \\).\n\n3. **Checking Integers Greater than 1**:\n   - We will evaluate integers starting from \\( n = 2 \\):\n     - \\( n = 2 \\): \\( \\gcd(2, 1050) \\neq 1 \\) (divisible by 2)\n     - \\( n = 3 \\): \\( \\gcd(3, 1050) \\neq 1 \\) (divisible by 3)\n     - \\( n = 4 \\): \\( \\gcd(4, 1050) \\neq 1 \\) (divisible by 2)\n     - \\( n = 5 \\): \\( \\gcd(5, 1050) \\neq 1 \\) (divisible by 5)\n     - \\( n = 6 \\): \\( \\gcd(6, 1050) \\neq 1 \\) (divisible by 2 and 3)\n     - \\( n = 7 \\): \\( \\gcd(7, 1050) \\neq 1 \\) (divisible by 7)\n     - \\( n = 8 \\): \\( \\gcd(8, 1050) \\neq 1 \\) (divisible by 2)\n     - \\( n = 9 \\): \\( \\gcd(9, 1050) \\neq 1 \\) (divisible by 3)\n     - \\( n = 10 \\): \\( \\gcd(10, 1050) \\neq 1 \\) (divisible by 2 and 5)\n     - \\( n = 11 \\): \\( \\gcd(11, 1050) = 1 \\) (not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7)\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The smallest integer \\( n \\) greater than 1 that is coprime to \\( 1050 \\) is \\( 11 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>11 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "For $n$ to have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$, it is necessary for $n$ to be relatively prime to $1050$. Conversely, if $n$ is relatively prime to $1050$, then $n$ has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.\n\nThe prime factors of $1050$ include $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$, so any multiple of any of these primes does not have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$. This rules out all the integers from $2$ to $10$. However, $11$ is relatively prime to $1050$, so $\\boxed{11}$ is the smallest integer greater than $1$ that has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$."
