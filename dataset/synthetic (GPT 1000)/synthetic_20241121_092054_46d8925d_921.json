  "problem": "Five couples were at a party. If each person shook hands exactly once with everyone else except his/her spouse, how many handshakes were exchanged? (Note: One obviously doesn't shake hands with oneself.)",
  "solution": "To determine the total number of handshakes exchanged at a party with five couples, we'll follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Count Participants**: \n   There are 5 couples at the party, each consisting of 2 individuals. Thus, the total number of people is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ couples} \\times 2 \\text{ people per couple} = 10 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Handshakes Without Restrictions**: \n   If all 10 individuals shook hands with every other attendee, the number of unique handshakes can be calculated using the combination formula. The number of ways to select 2 people from 10 (which represents a handshake) is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45\n   \\]\n\n3. **Adjust for Spousal Restrictions**: \n   Since spouses do not shake hands with each other, we must subtract one handshake for each couple from the total. As there are 5 couples, this results in the deduction of 5 handshakes.\n\n4. **Final Calculation of Handshakes**: \n   Therefore, the total number of handshakes, after accounting for the no-handshake rule between spouses, is:\n   \\[\n   45 - 5 = 40\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the total number of handshakes exchanged at the party, with the restriction of not shaking hands with spouses, is:\n<ANSWER>40 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "There are a total of 10 people at the party.  Each shakes hands with everyone else, except for their spouse, which will be a total of $10-2=8$ other people.  The total number of handshakes will be $10\\cdot8/2=\\boxed{40}$, where we divide by 2 to correct for counting each handshake twice."
