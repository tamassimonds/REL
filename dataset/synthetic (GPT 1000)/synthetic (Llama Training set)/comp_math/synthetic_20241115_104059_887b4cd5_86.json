    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking how a human would naturally think and work through it. I'll brainstorm various strategies, reflect and check my progress frequently, and be open to adjusting my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, it reminds me of probability scenarios involving sequential events\u2014like Markov processes or geometric series. Alice and Bob take turns flipping coins, and their wins depend on the outcome of these flips. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n1. **Sequential Probability:** Each turn has a probability attached to it\u2014Alice's turn has a 50% chance of winning immediately if she flips heads.\n2. **Alternating Turns:** If Alice doesn't win, Bob gets a chance, introducing another layer of probability.\n3. **Recurrence Relations:** Maybe I can set up an equation involving both players' probabilities.\n4. **Geometric Series:** Since it's a series of attempts until one wins, possibly involving infinite series.\n\nI'm not entirely sure which approach will be the best right now, so I'll explore these strategies and see where they lead.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Sequential Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- On Alice's first turn, she flips a coin:\n  - **Heads (H):** Alice wins immediately. Probability = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n  - **Tails (T):** Bob's turn. Probability = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n- If Alice flips tails, it's Bob's turn:\n  - **Tails (T):** Bob wins immediately. Probability = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n  - **Heads (H):** Returns to Alice's turn. Probability = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nWait, let me summarize this to see if I'm on the right track:\n\n1. **Alice's Turn:**\n   - Wins immediately: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n   - Moves to Bob's Turn: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\n2. **Bob's Turn:**\n   - Wins immediately: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n   - Moves back to Alice's Turn: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nHmm... it looks like each player's turn is independent, and the game can cycle back to Alice if both fail to win. This suggests a probabilistic cycle, which might be influenced by both players' chances of winning on their respective turns.\n\nI think I need to set up a way to account for these repeated opportunities. Let's move to a different strategy that might help better represent this.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Recurrence Relations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Maybe I can define the probability of Alice winning in terms of the probabilities of both players winning on their respective turns.\n- Let\u2019s denote:\n  - \\( P_A \\): Probability that Alice wins.\n  - \\( P_B \\): Probability that Bob wins.\n\n- From the previous strategy:\n  - Alice can win on her first turn with probability \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n  - If she doesn't win, Bob has a chance to win on his turn.\n\nBut wait, I realize I need to think about the probabilities in a cyclic manner since the game can go back to Alice if both players miss their winning chance. So, maybe defining \\( P_A \\) in terms of itself could work.\n\nLet\u2019s formalize this:\n\n1. The probability that Alice wins on her first turn: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n2. If Alice flips tails, Bob flips the coin:\n   - Probability that Bob flips tails and wins: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n   - Probability that Bob flips heads and it returns to Alice: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nSo, if Bob doesn't win either, it returns to Alice with a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nBut Alice's turn returning is similar to the initial scenario, so I can use \\( P_A \\) again. Let's set up an equation:\n\n\\[\nP_A = \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times P_A\\right)\n\\]\n\nHmm... does this make sense? If Alice wins instantly, that's direct. If not, and Bob doesn't win either, we're back to the same starting point, so multiplying by \\( P_A \\) seems right.\n\nBefore continuing, let me check whether this aligns with the game structure:\n\n- The equation suggests that Alice's total winning probability includes her immediate chance plus the chance to win after both players have had a turn without winning.\n\nI think it's on the right track, but let's verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking Strategy 2: Is the Recurrence Relation Correct?**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- In the equation \\( P_A = \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times P_A\\right) \\), the term \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) represents Alice's immediate win chance.\n- The \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times P_A \\) accounts for the scenario where both she and Bob didn't win on their turns, leading back to her initial winning probability \\( P_A \\).\n\n**Check:**\n- If no one wins in the first round, the game resets to the same conditions as at the start. This cyclical nature suggests that Alice's probability is inherently recursive, relying on \\( P_A \\) again.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The recurrence relation seems logical given the game's structure. Let's move forward and solve it for \\( P_A \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the Recurrence Relation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The equation is:\n  \\[\n  P_A = \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times P_A\\right)\n  \\]\n  \n- To isolate \\( P_A \\), let's rearrange the equation:\n\n  \\[\n  P_A - \\frac{1}{4} P_A = \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\right) P_A = \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{4} P_A = \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- Now, solve for \\( P_A \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  P_A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- According to this calculation, the probability that Alice wins is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nBut wait, let me verify this result using another approach to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Geometric Series**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Given that the game can cycle back to Alice infinitely, perhaps modeling it as an infinite geometric series could work.\n  \n- Let\u2019s consider the chances of Alice winning across multiple rounds:\n  - Win on the first turn: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n  - If not, and both players miss, Alice gets another chance: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n  - If still not, and both again miss, Alice gets another chance: \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{32} \\).\n  \n- This continues indefinitely, forming a series:\n  \\[\n  P_A = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{32} + \\cdots\n  \\]\n  \n- Is this series converging? Let\u2019s analyze:\n\n  - The first term is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n  - Each subsequent term is multiplied by \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) compared to the previous cycle.\n  \n- Wait, I think I made an error in my term setup. Let's reevaluate:\n\n  - Initially: Win immediately or else Bob plays.\n  - Correct terms:\n    - Win on the first turn: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n    - If Alice flips tails, Bob gets \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\):\n      - If Bob wins, probability \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n      - If Bob misses, returns to Alice with \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n  \n- So, the corrected series should be:\n\n  \\[\n  P_A = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} \\times P_A\n  \\]\n  \n  - This is the same recurrence relation we found earlier.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- When attempting to model the probability as an infinite series, it leads back to the same recurrence relation. This consistency suggests that our earlier approach was correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Both methods converge to the same probability: \\( P_A = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Verifying the Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- A probability of \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) signifies that Alice has a higher likelihood of winning compared to Bob.\n  \n- Given that Alice goes first, she has an immediate 50% chance to win. If she doesn't win, the game can cycle back to her multiple times, increasing her overall probability.\n\n**Check:**\n- Let\u2019s briefly consider a finite version to verify:\n\n  - If the game only had one round:\n    - Alice wins immediately: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n    - Bob wins if Alice misses: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n    - Total probability of Alice winning: \\( \\frac{1}{2} + 0 = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n  - With infinite rounds:\n    - The probabilities accumulate, leading to \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The probability \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) is reasonable and aligns with our calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe probability that Alice wins the game is **\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n1. **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n   - Explored sequential probability, recurrence relations, and geometric series.\n   \n2. **Selecting an Approach:**\n   - Started with sequential probability, realizing the cyclical nature needs a recurrence relation.\n   \n3. **Formulating the Recurrence:**\n   - Set up \\( P_A = \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times P_A\\right) \\).\n   \n4. **Solving for \\( P_A \\):**\n   - Isolated \\( P_A \\) to find \\( P_A = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n   \n5. **Cross-Verification:**\n   - Used geometric series to confirm the result aligns with the recurrence relation.\n   \n6. **Final Check:**\n   - Ensured the probability makes sense given Alice's advantage of playing first.\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected frequently, checked the validity of each step, and remained open to adjusting my approach when necessary. This iterative thinking led to a consistent and correct probability for Alice's winning chance.",

  "ground_truth": "Alice has a $1/2$ chance of winning the game on her first turn. If she doesn't, then the probability that she wins the game on her second turn is $1/8,$ since she must not win on her first flip ($1/2$ chance), Bob must not win on his first flip ($1/2$ chance), and then Alice must win on her second flip ($1/2$ chance). The probability that she wins the game on her third turn is $1/32,$ and in general, the probability that she wins the game on her $k^\\text{th}$ turn is $(1/2)^{2k-1}.$ Thus, the probability that Alice wins is an infinite geometric series with first term $1/2$ and common ratio $1/4.$ So, the probability that Alice wins the game is $$\\frac{\\frac12}{1-\\frac14} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}.$$OR\n\nNote that the only difference between the odds of Alice or Bob winning is who goes first. Because Bob goes second, the odds of him winning on his $k^\\text{th}$ flip is half of the odds that Alice wins on her $k^\\text{th}$ flip, since Alice must first get a tails before Bob gets a chance to win. Thus, if $a$ is Alice's chance of winning, and $b$ is Bob's chance of winning, then $a = 2b.$ Also, since someone must win, $a + b = 1.$ It follows that $a = 2/3$ and $b = 1/3,$ so Alice has a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ chance of winning the game."
