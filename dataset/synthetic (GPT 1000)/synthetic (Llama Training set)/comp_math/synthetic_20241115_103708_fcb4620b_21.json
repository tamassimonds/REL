    "working_out": "### Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. The question is asking me to find \\(\\frac{1}{a-1}+\\frac{1}{b-1}\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the roots of the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 - 7x + 2 = 0\\).\n\nInitially, I'm thinking about the relationship between the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefficients. I recall Vieta's formulas, which relate the sum and product of the roots to the coefficients. That might be a good starting point.\n\nBut then I wonder if I need to actually find the roots \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) explicitly or if there's a more clever way to compute \\(\\frac{1}{a-1} + \\frac{1}{b-1}\\) without solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) directly. Maybe factoring or substituting could help.\n\nLet me jot down some possible strategies:\n\n1. **Use Vieta's Formulas:** To find \\(a + b\\) and \\(ab\\) directly.\n2. **Directly Solve the Quadratic:** Use the quadratic formula to find \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n3. **Simplify the Expression:** Try to combine the fractions \\(\\frac{1}{a-1}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{b-1}\\) and see if that leads somewhere.\n4. **Alternative Methods:** Maybe set up a new variable or transformation that simplifies the problem.\n\nI'm leaning towards starting with Vieta's formulas because it might give me the information I need without getting too messy. But I'll keep the other strategies in mind if this doesn't seem to work.\n\n### Step 1: Applying Vieta's Formulas\n\nVieta's formulas state that for a quadratic equation \\(Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0\\), the roots \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) satisfy:\n\n\\[\na + b = -\\frac{B}{A} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad ab = \\frac{C}{A}\n\\]\n\nFor our equation \\(2x^2 - 7x + 2 = 0\\):\n\n- \\(A = 2\\)\n- \\(B = -7\\)\n- \\(C = 2\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\na + b = -\\frac{-7}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nab = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nWait, before I proceed, let me check if this information is enough to find \\(\\frac{1}{a-1} + \\frac{1}{b-1}\\). The expression involves \\(a-1\\) and \\(b-1\\), so maybe I need to relate \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to \\(a-1\\) and \\(b-1\\). Just knowing \\(a + b\\) and \\(ab\\) might not directly help.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to express \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in terms of \\(a-1\\) and \\(b-1\\). Let me think about that.\n\n### Step 2: Expressing \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in Terms of \\(a-1\\) and \\(b-1\\)\n\nI notice that \\(a - 1\\) and \\(b - 1\\) are simply \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) shifted by 1. So:\n\n\\[\na = (a - 1) + 1\n\\]\n\\[\nb = (b - 1) + 1\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't seem to directly help, but maybe substituting \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) into the original equation could work.\n\n### Step 3: Substituting \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) into the Quadratic Equation\n\nLet's substitute \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) back into the original quadratic equation to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nThe original equation is:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 7x + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nIf \\(x = a\\) or \\(x = b\\), then:\n\n\\[\n2a^2 - 7a + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2b^2 - 7b + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nBut I'm looking for \\(\\frac{1}{a-1} + \\frac{1}{b-1}\\). Maybe I should manipulate this expression using \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the Expression \\(\\frac{1}{a-1} + \\frac{1}{b-1}\\)\n\nLet me try combining the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a-1} + \\frac{1}{b-1} = \\frac{(b-1) + (a-1)}{(a-1)(b-1)} = \\frac{a + b - 2}{(a-1)(b-1)}\n\\]\n\nFrom Step 1, we know \\(a + b = \\frac{7}{2}\\), so:\n\n\\[\na + b - 2 = \\frac{7}{2} - 2 = \\frac{7}{2} - \\frac{4}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo now we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a-1} + \\frac{1}{b-1} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{(a-1)(b-1)}\n\\]\n\nWait, this is progress! But now I need to find \\((a-1)(b-1)\\).\n\n### Step 5: Finding \\((a-1)(b-1)\\)\n\nLet's expand \\((a-1)(b-1)\\):\n\n\\[\n(a-1)(b-1) = ab - (a + b) + 1\n\\]\n\nWe know:\n\n- \\(ab = 1\\) (from Step 1)\n- \\(a + b = \\frac{7}{2}\\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n(a-1)(b-1) = 1 - \\frac{7}{2} + 1 = 1 + 1 - \\frac{7}{2} = 2 - \\frac{7}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} - \\frac{7}{2} = -\\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nHmm, \\((a-1)(b-1) = -\\frac{3}{2}\\). That seems unusual because we're dealing with fractions, and negative denominators can sometimes lead to incorrect signs in the final answer. But mathematically, this makes sense given the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nLet me check if this aligns with the original quadratic equation.\n\n### Step 6: Verifying with the Quadratic Equation\n\nThe roots \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) satisfy:\n\n\\[\n2a^2 - 7a + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2b^2 - 7b + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nIf I substitute \\(x = a - 1\\) and \\(x = b - 1\\) into the equation, let's see if it holds:\n\n\\[\n2(a - 1)^2 - 7(a - 1) + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2(b - 1)^2 - 7(b - 1) + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n2(a^2 - 2a + 1) - 7(a - 1) + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2a^2 - 4a + 2 - 7a + 7 + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2a^2 - 11a + 11 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimilarly for \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\n2b^2 - 11b + 11 = 0\n\\]\n\nBut wait, this doesn't seem to align with the original equation \\(2x^2 - 7x + 2 = 0\\). The coefficients have changed.\n\n### Reflection and Re-evaluation\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere. If substituting \\(a - 1\\) and \\(b - 1\\) into the original equation changes the coefficients, maybe my approach isn't correct.\n\nLet me backtrack and see where I went wrong.\n\n### Backtracking and Correcting the Approach\n\nI realize that making substitutions like \\(x = a - 1\\) and \\(x = b - 1\\) changes the quadratic equation itself, which might not be the right path.\n\nInstead, let's stick to the original quadratic and focus on simplifying \\(\\frac{1}{a-1} + \\frac{1}{b-1}\\) using the expressions we already have.\n\n### Step 7: Continuing with the Simplified Expression\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a-1} + \\frac{1}{b-1} = \\frac{a + b - 2}{(a-1)(b-1)} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{(a-1)(b-1)}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find \\((a-1)(b-1)\\). Let's find another way to calculate this without complicating things.\n\n### Step 8: Alternative Method to Find \\((a-1)(b-1)\\)\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\n(a-1)(b-1) = ab - (a + b) + 1\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n(a-1)(b-1) = 1 - \\frac{7}{2} + 1 = 2 - \\frac{7}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} - \\frac{7}{2} = -\\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\((a-1)(b-1) = -\\frac{3}{2}\\), which aligns with our earlier calculation.\n\n### Step 9: Substituting Back into the Expression\n\nNow, let's substitute \\((a-1)(b-1)\\) back into the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a-1} + \\frac{1}{b-1} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{-\\frac{3}{2}}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2} \\times -\\frac{2}{3} = -1\n\\]\n\n### Final Check\n\nLet me quickly verify if all steps make sense:\n\n- **Vieta's Formulas:** Correctly provided \\(a + b\\) and \\(ab\\).\n- **Simplifying the Expression:** Combined \\(\\frac{1}{a-1} + \\frac{1}{b-1}\\) correctly.\n- **Calculating \\((a-1)(b-1)\\):** Correctly calculated as \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n- **Final Simplification:** Result simplifies correctly to \\(-1\\).\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and correcting my approach when needed, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a-1} + \\frac{1}{b-1} = -1\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step method ensured that each part of the problem was addressed carefully, leading to a correct and verified solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a,$ respectively. This means that $a+b = 7/2$ and $ab = 2/2 = 1.$ Now we manipulate the expression $\\frac{1}{a-1}+\\frac{1}{b-1}$ to get:  $$\\frac{1}{a-1}+\\frac{1}{b-1} = \\frac{b-1}{(a-1)(b-1)} + \\frac{a-1}{(a-1)(b-1)} = \\frac{(a+b)-2}{(a-1)(b-1)}.$$ But the denominator $$(a-1)(b-1) = ab - a - b + 1 = (ab) - (a+b) + 1 = 1 - 7/2 + 1 = 2 - 7/2,$$ whereas the numerator $a+b-2 = 7/2 - 2.$\n\nThus, our answer is $\\frac{7/2-2}{2-7/2} = \\boxed{-1}.$"
