    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle this problem step-by-step, mirroring how a human would naturally think through it. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check if my approach is correct, and adjust as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, looking at the problem, we have two circles defined by their equations:\n\n1. \\((x - 9)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 6.25\\)\n2. \\((x + 6)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 49\\)\n\nThe question asks for the **shortest distance** between these two circles. \n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Distance Between Centers:** At first, I think maybe finding the distance between the centers of the circles could be a good starting point. After all, the shortest path between two points is a straight line, right?\n  \n- **Checking Overlap or Touching:** I wonder if these circles overlap or just touch each other. If they do, the shortest distance would be zero, but I need to check that carefully.\n\n- **Circles Not Touching or Overlapping:** If they don\u2019t touch or overlap, then perhaps I need to consider the distance as the distance between their closest points.\n\nBut wait, I need to be sure. Let me dive deeper into each possibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identify Centers and Radii**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo proceed, I should first identify the centers and radii of both circles. That seems essential since the position and size of the circles will determine the shortest distance between them.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **First Circle:**\n   - Center: \\((9, 5)\\)\n   - Radius: \\(\\sqrt{6.25} = 2.5\\)\n\n   Reflection: Okay, so the first circle is centered at \\((9, 5)\\) with a radius of \\(2.5\\).\n\n2. **Second Circle:**\n   - Center: \\((-6, -3)\\)\n   - Radius: \\(\\sqrt{49} = 7\\)\n\n   Reflection: The second circle is centered at \\((-6, -3)\\) with a radius of \\(7\\).\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, I extracted the centers and radii correctly from the equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Distance Between Centers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll find the distance between the centers of the two circles. This distance will help determine their relative positions\u2014whether they touch, overlap, or are completely separate.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nUsing the distance formula:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of the centers:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{((-6) - 9)^2 + ((-3) - 5)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{(-15)^2 + (-8)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{225 + 64}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{289}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 17\n\\]\n\nReflection: So, the distance between the centers is \\(17\\) units. \n\n**Check:** Is this number reasonable? Yes, \\(17\\) units is a significant distance, suggesting that the circles are likely separate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Compare Distance to Radii**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNext, I need to see how this distance compares to the sum and difference of the radii. This will help determine the relationship between the two circles.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Sum of Radii:**\n   \\[\n   2.5 + 7 = 9.5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Difference of Radii:**\n   \\[\n   7 - 2.5 = 4.5\n   \\]\n\nReflection: The sum of the radii is \\(9.5\\), and the difference is \\(4.5\\).\n\n**Check:** \n\n- **Case 1:** If the distance between centers \\(d = 17\\) is **greater than** the sum of the radii \\(9.5\\), the circles are **separate**.\n- **Case 2:** If \\(d < 4.5\\), one circle is **inside** the other without touching.\n- **Case 3:** If \\(d\\) **equals** the sum or difference, the circles are **touching** externally or internally, respectively.\n\nHere, \\(17 > 9.5\\), so the circles are separate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Shortest Distance Between Circles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince the circles are separate, the shortest distance between them would be the distance between their centers minus the sum of their radii. This accounts for the overlap (which is zero in this case) and gives the direct distance between the closest points of the two circles.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Shortest Distance} = d - (\\text{radius}_1 + \\text{radius}_2) = 17 - 9.5 = 7.5\n\\]\n\nReflection: \n\n- So, the shortest distance between the two circles is \\(7.5\\) units.\n- This makes sense because the circles are far apart, and their combined radii don\u2019t reach the distance between their centers.\n\n**Check:** Is the calculation correct? Yes, subtracting the sum of the radii from the distance between centers gives \\(7.5\\), which aligns with our expectations for separate circles.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Express Answer as a Decimal to the Nearest Tenth**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe problem requests the answer to be expressed as a decimal to the nearest tenth. Our calculated distance is already in that format, but let's ensure it's rounded correctly.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n7.5 \\text{ (already to the nearest tenth)}\n\\]\n\nReflection: The number is already in the required format, so no further rounding is needed.\n\n**Check:** Does \\(7.5\\) make sense as a shortest distance? Yes, it's a logical result given the separateness of the circles.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Our approach of comparing the distance between centers to the sum and difference of the radii is standard for such problems. It logically leads to the correct solution.\n  \n- **Possible Alternative Strategies:** Initially, I thought about directly calculating the closest points on the circle perimeters, but that would be more complex and unnecessary since we simplified it by focusing on the centers.\n\n- **Mistakes and Corrections:** At no point did I identify a mistake that required a major directional change. The method flowed naturally once the relationship between the centers and radii was established.\n\n- **Alternative Thoughts:** An alternative check could involve visualizing the circles or plotting their positions, but mathematically, the distance calculation suffices.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe shortest distance between the circles \\((x - 9)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 6.25\\) and \\((x + 6)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 49\\) is **7.5 units**.\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, verifying each step, and ensuring calculations were correct, we've arrived at a confident and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The first circle is centered at $(9,5)$ and has a radius of $\\sqrt{6.25} = 2.5$. The second circle is centered at $(-6,-3)$ and has a radius of $\\sqrt{49} = 7$. To find the shortest distance between the circles, we draw a segment connecting their centers, and subtract off the radii of the two circles. The distance between the centers of the circles is $\\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2 + (5-(-3))^2} = \\sqrt{15^2+8^2} = 17$. So the shortest distance between the circles is $17 - 2.5 - 7 = \\boxed{7.5}$."
