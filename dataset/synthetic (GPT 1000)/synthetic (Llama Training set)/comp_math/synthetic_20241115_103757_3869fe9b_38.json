    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would tackle it in real life. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work as I go to ensure I'm on the right track. If something doesn't seem right, I'll backtrack and try a different approach. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, I see it's about finding the ratio of the area of triangle \\( DEF \\) to that of triangle \\( ABC \\). The vertices of triangle \\( ABC \\) are given, along with specific points \\( D \\), \\( E \\), and \\( F \\) dividing the sides in a particular ratio.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Coordinate Geometry Approach:** Since all points are given in coordinates, maybe using the area formula for triangles in the coordinate plane could work.\n- **Mass Point Geometry:** This method involves assigning weights to points to simplify finding the centroid or other related points.\n- **Vector Approach:** Utilizing vectors to express the positions and areas might be another way.\n- **Use of Ratios:** Since the problem involves dividing the sides in specific ratios, maybe leveraging these ratios to find the coordinates of \\( D \\), \\( E \\), and \\( F \\) would help.\n\nI'm leaning towards starting with **finding the coordinates of \\( D \\), \\( E \\), and \\( F \\)** using the given ratios, then using the **coordinate geometry approach** to calculate the areas. If this seems too complex, I'll consider switching strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Coordinates of \\( D \\), \\( E \\), and \\( F \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's tackle this by finding the coordinates of points \\( D \\), \\( E \\), and \\( F \\) on segments \\( AB \\), \\( BC \\), and \\( CA \\) respectively. The ratios given are \\( 2(AD) = DB \\), \\( 2(BE) = EC \\), and \\( 2(CF) = FA \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Finding \\( D \\) on \\( AB \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   2(AD) = DB \\implies AD : DB = 1 : 2\n   \\]\n   \n   This means \\( D \\) divides \\( AB \\) in the ratio \\( 1 : 2 \\).\n\n   Let's find the coordinates:\n   \n   \\[\n   D = \\left(\\frac{1 \\times 9 + 2 \\times 0}{1 + 2}, \\frac{1 \\times 6 + 2 \\times 0}{1 + 2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{9}{3}, \\frac{6}{3}\\right) = (3, 2)\n   \\]\n\n   **Reflection:** Does this make sense? Yes, dividing \\( AB \\) in \\( 1 : 2 \\) gives \\( D \\) closer to \\( A \\), which aligns with the ratio.\n\n2. **Finding \\( E \\) on \\( BC \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   2(BE) = EC \\implies BE : EC = 1 : 2\n   \\]\n   \n   So, \\( E \\) divides \\( BC \\) in the ratio \\( 1 : 2 \\).\n\n   Coordinates:\n   \n   \\[\n   E = \\left(\\frac{1 \\times 6 + 2 \\times 9}{1 + 2}, \\frac{1 \\times 12 + 2 \\times 6}{1 + 2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{6 + 18}{3}, \\frac{12 + 12}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{24}{3}, \\frac{24}{3}\\right) = (8, 8)\n   \\]\n\n   **Check:** \\( E \\) is at \\( (8, 8) \\), which is two-thirds the way from \\( B \\) to \\( C \\). That seems correct.\n\n3. **Finding \\( F \\) on \\( CA \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   2(CF) = FA \\implies CF : FA = 1 : 2\n   \\]\n   \n   Thus, \\( F \\) divides \\( CA \\) in the ratio \\( 1 : 2 \\).\n\n   Coordinates:\n   \n   \\[\n   F = \\left(\\frac{1 \\times 0 + 2 \\times 6}{1 + 2}, \\frac{1 \\times 0 + 2 \\times 12}{1 + 2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{0 + 12}{3}, \\frac{0 + 24}{3}\\right) = (4, 8)\n   \\]\n\n   **Reflection:** Does this make sense? \\( F \\) is at \\( (4, 8) \\), which is two-thirds the way from \\( C \\) to \\( A \\). That seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Area of Triangle \\( ABC \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that we have the coordinates of all vertices, I can use the **coordinate geometry formula** for the area of a triangle to find the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n**Formula:**\nFor vertices \\( (x_1, y_1) \\), \\( (x_2, y_2) \\), \\( (x_3, y_3) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nPlugging in the coordinates:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0(6 - 12) + 9(12 - 0) + 6(0 - 6) \\right|\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 + 108 - 36 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 72 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** The area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is **36** square units. This seems reasonable given the coordinates.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Area of Triangle \\( DEF \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNext, I need to find the area of triangle \\( DEF \\) using the same formula. With \\( D(3,2) \\), \\( E(8,8) \\), and \\( F(4,8) \\), let's compute the area.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{DEF} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 3(8 - 8) + 8(8 - 2) + 4(2 - 8) \\right|\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 3 \\times 0 + 8 \\times 6 + 4 \\times (-6) \\right|\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 + 48 - 24 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 24 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Check:** The area of triangle \\( DEF \\) is **12** square units. Let me quickly verify the calculations:\n\n- \\( 3(8 - 8) = 3 \\times 0 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 8(8 - 2) = 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\)\n- \\( 4(2 - 8) = 4 \\times (-6) = -24 \\)\n\nAdding them up: \\( 0 + 48 - 24 = 24 \\), and half of that is **12**. This looks correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Ratio of the Areas**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I have both areas, I can find the ratio of the area of triangle \\( DEF \\) to the area of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Area}_{DEF}}{\\text{Area}_{ABC}} = \\frac{12}{36} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** The ratio simplifies to **\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)**. This seems reasonable, considering that each point \\( D \\), \\( E \\), and \\( F \\) divides the sides of triangle \\( ABC \\) in a 1:2 ratio.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing my answer, let's reflect. Did dividing each side in a 1:2 ratio make sense? Does the area calculation align with the expected geometric intuition?\n\n- **Division Ratios:** Each point divides a side in a 1:2 ratio, meaning \\( D \\) is one-third along \\( AB \\), \\( E \\) is one-third along \\( BC \\), and \\( F \\) is one-third along \\( CA \\). This should create a smaller triangle \\( DEF \\) inside \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with a proportional area.\n  \n- **Area Calculation:** The area calculations follow the coordinate geometry formula correctly, and the ratios were applied accurately.\n\n**Check:** Given the symmetry and the proportional division, an area ratio of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) seems logical.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout this problem:\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Exploring different strategies helped confirm that starting with finding the coordinates was the right approach.\n  \n- **Step-by-Step Calculations:** Each step was carefully calculated, ensuring accuracy.\n  \n- **Continuous Checking:** Regular checks ensured that the approach was correct, and adjustments were made when needed.\n\nBy treating each part of the problem thoughtfully and checking along the way, I've arrived at the final ratio confidently.",

  "ground_truth": "First observe that if one vertex of a triangle is moved directly toward another vertex so as to shrink one side length of the triangle by a factor of $k$, then the area of the triangle is also shrinked by $k$.  To see this, think of the side that is shrinking as the base in the equation $\\text{area}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})$.\n\nUse brackets to denote area; for example, $[ABC]$ refers to the area of triangle $ABC$.
