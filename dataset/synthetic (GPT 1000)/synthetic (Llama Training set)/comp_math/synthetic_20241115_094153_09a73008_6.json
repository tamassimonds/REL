    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it as if I'm working through it naturally, brainstorming different strategies, checking for correctness, and adjusting my methods as needed. Here we go:\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem is about rolling six 6-sided dice and finding the probability that three dice show prime numbers while the rest show composite numbers. \n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** \n  - I know that each die has six faces, numbered 1 through 6. \n  - I recall that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, among 1 to 6, I think the prime numbers are 2, 3, and 5.\n  - Composite numbers are greater than 1 and have more than two divisors. So, from 1 to 6, the composites should be 4 and 6.\n  - Wait, what about 1? It's neither prime nor composite. I need to consider this.\n\n- **Reflection:** \n  - If 1 is neither prime nor composite, I should account for it in the total possible outcomes. This might affect the probability calculations.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Counting the Favorable Outcomes:**\n   - Determine how many ways three dice can show primes and the remaining three show composites.\n   \n2. **Calculating Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   - Each die has six faces, so for six dice, it's \\(6^6\\) total combinations.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - Probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.\n\n### **Attempting Strategy 1: Counting Favorable Outcomes**\n\n- **Step 1: Identifying Prime and Composite Numbers**\n  - **Prime Numbers:** 2, 3, 5 \u2192 Total of 3 prime numbers\n  - **Composite Numbers:** 4, 6 \u2192 Total of 2 composite numbers\n  - **Number 1:** Neither prime nor composite\n\n- **Step 2: Selecting Dice to Show Prime Numbers**\n  - I need three dice to show primes. \n  - The number of ways to choose three dice out of six is given by combinations: \\(\\text{C}(6, 3)\\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{C}(6, 3) = \\frac{6!}{3! \\times (6-3)!} = 20\n  \\]\n\n  - **Thought:** So, there are 20 different ways to select which three dice will show prime numbers.\n\n- **Step 3: Assigning Prime Numbers to Selected Dice**\n  - Each selected die can show any of the 3 prime numbers. \n  - So, for each selection, there are \\(3^3\\) ways to assign prime numbers.\n\n  \\[\n  3^3 = 27\n  \\]\n\n- **Step 4: Assigning Composite Numbers to Remaining Dice**\n  - The remaining three dice need to show composite numbers. \n  - Each of these dice can show any of the 2 composite numbers.\n\n  \\[\n  2^3 = 8\n  \\]\n\n- **Step 5: Calculating Total Favorable Outcomes**\n  - Multiply the number of ways to select dice by the number of ways to assign prime and composite numbers:\n\n  \\[\n  20 \\times 27 \\times 8 = 4,320\n  \\]\n\n### **Calculating Total Possible Outcomes**\n\n- Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes for six dice is:\n\n\\[\n6^6 = 46,656\n\\]\n\n### **Calculating the Probability**\n\n- The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{4,320}{46,656}\n\\]\n\n- **Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4,320}{46,656} = \\frac{4,320 \\div 432}{46,656 \\div 432} = \\frac{10}{108} = \\frac{5}{54}\n  \\]\n\n### **Checking Work and Reflecting**\n\n- **Quick Check:** \n  - The fraction \\(\\frac{5}{54}\\) seems reasonable. It's a small probability, which makes sense because we're looking for a specific combination in a large sample space.\n\n- **Deep Reflection:** \n  - Wait, did I account for number 1 correctly? Since 1 is neither prime nor composite, should I have excluded it from the possible outcomes per die?\n  - Hmm, but each die still has six faces, and the problem doesn't exclude rolling a 1. I think I handled it correctly by only considering primes and composites in the favorable outcomes.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy Consideration:** \n  - Maybe I could approach this using conditional probabilities or by considering exclusions, but given the straightforward counting method seems to work, I'll stick with it.\n\n### **Finalizing the Answer**\n\nAfter walking through the steps, reflecting on each part, and ensuring that all aspects are covered, the probability that three of the six dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully identifying prime and composite numbers, calculating the number of ways to assign these to the dice, and then dividing by the total possible outcomes, I've arrived at the final probability. Throughout the process, I've checked for potential oversights, such as the role of the number 1, and confirmed that the approach is correct. This ensures that the solution is both accurate and thorough.",

  "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose three of the dice to show prime numbers. Each roll is prime with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and composite with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$, so each arrangement of 3 prime numbers and 3 composite numbers occurs with probability $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!3}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!3}.$ Therefore, the probability that three dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers is $$20\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!3}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{\\!3}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}.$$"
