    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like how I'd tackle it naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, the question is about finding how many unique values can be formed by the fraction \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\), where both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) can be 4, 8, or 12. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Option Combinations:** My first thought is to list all possible combinations of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). There are three options for \\(x\\) and three for \\(y\\), so maybe there are \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) total fractions.\n  \n- **Simplification:** But wait, I remember from previous problems that fractions can be simplified. So, some of these might be equivalent, leading to fewer unique values.\n  \n- **Alternative Approach:** Another idea is to use the concept of greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify each fraction right away, ensuring I only count unique fractions.\n\n**Reflection:** Listing all combinations seems straightforward, but I might end up counting equivalent fractions multiple times. Simplifying first could save time and effort.\n\n**Conclusion:** Let's start by listing all possible fractions and then simplify them to see how many unique values there are.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Listing All Possible Fractions**\n\nI'll create a table to list all combinations of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\nx & y \\\\\n\\hline\n4 & 4 \\\\\n4 & 8 \\\\\n4 & 12 \\\\\n8 & 4 \\\\\n8 & 8 \\\\\n8 & 12 \\\\\n12 & 4 \\\\\n12 & 8 \\\\\n12 & 12 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Total Combinations:** As expected, there are 9 fractions.\n\n**Check:** This aligns with my initial thought\u2014there are 3 options for \\(x\\) and 3 for \\(y\\), making \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) total combinations.\n\n**Reflection:** I need to remember that some of these fractions will simplify to the same value. Time to move to the next step to find the unique ones.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying Each Fraction**\n\nNow, I'll simplify each fraction to see how many unique values there are.\n\n1. \\(\\frac{4}{4} = 1\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{8}{4} = 2\\)\n5. \\(\\frac{8}{8} = 1\\)\n6. \\(\\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}\\)\n7. \\(\\frac{12}{4} = 3\\)\n8. \\(\\frac{12}{8} = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n9. \\(\\frac{12}{12} = 1\\)\n\n**Simplified List:**\n\n- \\(1\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n- \\(2\\)\n- \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n- \\(3\\)\n- \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\)\n\n**Check:** Wait, I see that \\(1\\) appears multiple times. Also, fractions like \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) are unique. \n\n**Reflection:** It looks like many fractions simplify to unique values. I should list them without duplicates to find the total number of unique fractions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Unique Values**\n\nLet's remove duplicates from the simplified list:\n\n\\[\n\\{1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, 2, \\frac{2}{3}, 3, \\frac{3}{2}\\}\n\\]\n\n**Total Unique Values:** There are 7 unique values.\n\n**Check:** Let me quickly verify if I've missed any or counted any extra:\n\n- **Fractions Greater Than 1:** \\(2, 3, \\frac{3}{2}\\) are greater than 1.\n- **Fractions Less Than 1:** \\(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, 1\\) are less than or equal to 1.\n  \nEverything seems to be accounted for.\n\n**Reflection:** I started with 9 combinations, but after simplifying and removing duplicates, I ended up with 7 unique values. This makes sense because some fractions are equivalent (e.g., \\(\\frac{4}{8}\\) and \\(\\frac{8}{4}\\)).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Alternative Approach\u2014Using GCD**\n\n**Thinking:** Is there a quicker way to arrive at the same result? Maybe using the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify fractions right away.\n\n**GCD Insight:**\n\n- **\\(\\frac{x}{y}\\):** Simplify by dividing both numerator and denominator by their GCD.\n  \n**Application:**\n\n- For each pair \\((x, y)\\), find \\(\\text{GCD}(x, y)\\) and divide both by GCD to simplify.\n  \n**Example:**\n\n- \\(\\frac{4}{8}\\): \\(\\text{GCD}(4, 8) = 4\\), so \\(\\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n- \\(\\frac{8}{12}\\): \\(\\text{GCD}(8, 12) = 4\\), so \\(\\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n  \n**Benefit:** By applying GCD upfront, I can avoid listing all fractions and simplifying them later.\n\n**Reflection:** This approach can be more efficient, but since I started by listing all combinations, it's good to check if both methods align.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Validating Both Approaches**\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n- **Listing and Simplifying:** Led to identifying 7 unique values.\n- **GCD Method:** Should yield the same result if applied correctly.\n\n**Check:** Let me apply the GCD method to see if it matches.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}\nx & y & \\frac{x}{y} & \\text{Simplified} \\\\\n\\hline\n4 & 4 & \\frac{4}{4} & 1 \\\\\n4 & 8 & \\frac{4}{8} & \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n4 & 12 & \\frac{4}{12} & \\frac{1}{3} \\\\\n8 & 4 & \\frac{8}{4} & 2 \\\\\n8 & 8 & \\frac{8}{8} & 1 \\\\\n8 & 12 & \\frac{8}{12} & \\frac{2}{3} \\\\\n12 & 4 & \\frac{12}{4} & 3 \\\\\n12 & 8 & \\frac{12}{8} & \\frac{3}{2} \\\\\n12 & 12 & \\frac{12}{12} & 1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Simplified List with GCD:**\n- \\(1\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n- \\(2\\)\n- \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n- \\(3\\)\n- \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\)\n\n**Match:** Both methods yield the same set of unique values.\n\n**Reflection:** Using GCD confirms the accuracy of the first method. It's always good to cross-check using a different approach to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring No Overlooked Cases**\n\n**Thinking:** Is there any possibility that I've missed unique fractions or counted duplicates incorrectly?\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\n- **Unique Fraction Properties:**\n  - Fractions in simplest form have no common factors between numerator and denominator other than 1.\n  - Each unique fraction represents a distinct value.\n\n**Check:** All fractions have been simplified, and duplicates have been removed.\n\n**Reflection:** I'm confident that the final count of unique values is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThere are **7 unique values** that can be formed by the fraction \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\) where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are either 4, 8, or 12:\n\n\\[\n\\{1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, 2, \\frac{2}{3}, 3, \\frac{3}{2}\\}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Reflection**\n\n- **Process Summary:** Started by listing all possible fractions, simplified them to identify unique values, and validated the result using an alternative approach with GCD.\n  \n- **Mistakes or Realizations:** Initially considered listing all combinations without simplification, which could lead to counting duplicates. Applying GCD early on could streamline the process.\n  \n- **Confidence in Answer:** Both methods align, confirming that there are 7 unique values.\n\n- **Taking Correct Steps:** Regular checks ensured that duplicates were removed and the correct number of unique fractions was identified.\n\n**Final Thought:** It's crucial to explore multiple strategies and validate results to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with simplified fractions.",
