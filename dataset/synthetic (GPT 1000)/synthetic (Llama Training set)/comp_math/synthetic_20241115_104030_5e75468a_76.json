    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and make sure to check if everything makes sense along the way. Just like a human would, I'll let my thoughts flow, including any doubts or \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**\"How many square units are in the region satisfying the inequalities \\( y \\ge |x| \\) and \\( y \\le -|x| + 3 \\)? Express your answer as a decimal.\"**\n\nMy initial reaction is:\n\n- **Familiar Inequalities:** The inequalities involve absolute values, which remind me of problems involving reflections across axes. I think I've dealt with absolute value inequalities before, perhaps related to finding regions bounded by lines.\n\n- **Graphical Interpretation:** Maybe sketching the graphs of these inequalities could help visualize the region. Graphing always seems like a good starting point for understanding how these inequalities interact.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Graphical Method:** Plot both inequalities on a coordinate plane and identify the overlapping region.\n  - **Algebraic Approach:** Solve the inequalities algebraically to find intersection points or boundary equations.\n  - **Area Calculation:** Once the overlapping region is defined, calculate its area using geometry.\n\n- **But Wait\u2026:** I'm not entirely sure which method will be the most straightforward. Maybe starting with a graphical approach will give me better insight, and from there, I can decide if an algebraic method is needed.\n\n## **Step 1: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nGiven my initial thoughts, let's explore the strategies:\n\n1. **Graphical Method:** Plot \\( y \\ge |x| \\) and \\( y \\le -|x| + 3 \\) to find the region visually.\n   - **Pros:** Immediate visual understanding; can easily identify intersection points and the shape of the region.\n   - **Cons:** Might be less precise without exact coordinates; requires accurate graphing.\n\n2. **Algebraic Approach:** Solve the inequalities to find intersection points and define the region mathematically.\n   - **Pros:** Provides exact coordinates; can be more precise for area calculations.\n   - **Cons:** Might involve more calculations; requires careful handling of absolute values.\n\n3. **Combine Both Methods:** Start with a graphical approach to get a sense of the region, then use algebra to find exact boundaries and calculate the area.\n   - **Pros:** Utilizes the strengths of both methods; ensures accuracy.\n   - **Cons:** More steps involved; requires switching between graphical and algebraic thinking.\n\n**Reflection:** I think starting with the graphical method will help me visualize the problem better. If I encounter difficulties in finding exact area measurements, I can switch to an algebraic approach for precision.\n\n## **Step 2: Attempting the Graphical Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me try sketching the graphs of the inequalities:\n\n1. **Graph \\( y = |x| \\):**\n   - This represents a V-shaped graph with its vertex at the origin (0, 0).\n   - The graph opens upwards, with straight lines \\( y = x \\) for \\( x \\ge 0 \\) and \\( y = -x \\) for \\( x < 0 \\).\n\n2. **Graph \\( y = -|x| + 3 \\):**\n   - This represents an inverted V-shaped graph with its vertex at (0, 3).\n   - The graph opens downwards, with lines \\( y = -x + 3 \\) for \\( x \\ge 0 \\) and \\( y = x + 3 \\) for \\( x < 0 \\).\n\n**Reflection:** So, I have two V-shaped graphs. The first one opens upwards from the origin, and the second one opens downwards from (0, 3). Now, I need to find where these graphs intersect to determine the boundaries of the overlapping region.\n\n**Thought:** Wait, can I just visually inspect where these two graphs overlap? Maybe I can identify the vertices of the overlapping region by finding their intersection points.\n\n## **Step 3: Finding Intersection Points**\n\n**Method:** Set the equations of the two graphs equal to each other to find their intersection points.\n\n1. **For \\( x \\ge 0 \\):**\n   \\[\n   y = x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -x + 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Rightarrow x = -x + 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow 2x = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow x = 1.5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Rightarrow y = 1.5\n   \\]\n   **Point:** (1.5, 1.5)\n\n2. **For \\( x < 0 \\):**\n   \\[\n   y = -x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = x + 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Rightarrow -x = x + 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow -2x = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow x = -1.5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Rightarrow y = 1.5\n   \\]\n   **Point:** (-1.5, 1.5)\n\n**Reflection:** So, the intersection points are (1.5, 1.5) and (-1.5, 1.5). It seems that both points have the same y-coordinate, which suggests that the overlapping region might be a horizontal strip. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\n**Check:** Does it make sense for the overlapping region to be a horizontal strip? Yes, because both intersection points lie on the line \\( y = 1.5 \\), indicating that the top and bottom boundaries of the region are horizontal lines.\n\n## **Step 4: Identifying the Overlapping Region**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBased on the intersection points, I can now define the overlapping region:\n\n- The region is bounded by:\n  - **Above:** \\( y = 1.5 \\) (since \\( y \\le -|x| + 3 \\) and intersects at y = 1.5)\n  - **Below:** \\( y = 1.5 \\) (since \\( y \\ge |x| \\) and intersects at y = 1.5)\n\n**Reflection:** Wait a minute\u2014this suggests that the overlapping region is actually a line segment along \\( y = 1.5 \\). That doesn't make sense for an area calculation because a line has no area. I must have made a mistake or misinterpreted the region.\n\n**Realization:** Ah, I see. The overlapping region is not just a line segment but rather a bounded area where the two V-shaped graphs intersect. Let me re-evaluate my approach.\n\n**Possible Mistake:** I might have assumed that both intersection points define a flat region, but perhaps the region is more complex, like a diamond or parallelogram shape, depending on the given inequalities.\n\n## **Step 5: Reassessing the Overlapping Region**\n\n**Re-approach:**\n\nInstead of assuming a flat region, let's consider the following:\n\n- **Inequality \\( y \\ge |x| \\):** This includes all points above or on the lines \\( y = x \\) and \\( y = -x \\).\n- **Inequality \\( y \\le -|x| + 3 \\):** This includes all points below or on the lines \\( y = -x + 3 \\) and \\( y = x + 3 \\).\n\n**Thought:** Maybe the overlapping region is bounded by these four lines, forming a diamond shape. Let's see if that's the case.\n\n**Graphical Insight:** The lines \\( y = x + 3 \\) and \\( y = -x + 3 \\) will intersect the lines \\( y = x \\) and \\( y = -x \\) at points different from the intersection points found earlier. Perhaps these points define the corners of the overlapping region.\n\n**Action:** Let me find these additional intersection points to better define the overlapping region.\n\n## **Step 6: Finding Additional Intersection Points**\n\n**Method:** Find the points where the boundary lines of the two inequalities intersect.\n\n1. **Intersection of \\( y = x \\) and \\( y = x + 3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = x + 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\text{no solution}\n   \\]\n   **Reflection:** This means these lines are parallel and do not intersect.\n\n2. **Intersection of \\( y = x \\) and \\( y = -x + 3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = -x + 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow 2x = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow x = 1.5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Rightarrow y = 1.5\n   \\]\n   **Point:** (1.5, 1.5)\n\n3. **Intersection of \\( y = -x \\) and \\( y = x + 3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   -x = x + 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow -2x = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow x = -1.5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Rightarrow y = 1.5\n   \\]\n   **Point:** (-1.5, 1.5)\n\n4. **Intersection of \\( y = -x \\) and \\( y = -x + 3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   -x = -x + 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\text{no solution}\n   \\]\n   **Reflection:** Again, these lines are parallel and do not intersect.\n\n**Reflection:** It seems that the only intersection points yielding valid solutions are (1.5, 1.5) and (-1.5, 1.5). This suggests that the overlapping region is indeed bounded horizontally at \\( y = 1.5 \\), but perhaps it's more than just a line segment.\n\n**Check:** Wait, does this make sense? If the region is only defined by these two points, that would imply a line segment, which cannot have an area. Maybe the area is defined differently, perhaps considering the overlapping sections of each V-shape.\n\n## **Step 7: Visualizing the Overlapping Area**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo better understand the overlapping region, let's consider the following:\n\n- **Graph \\( y = x \\) and \\( y = -x \\):** These are the arms of the V-shape opening upwards.\n- **Graph \\( y = -x + 3 \\) and \\( y = x + 3 \\):** These are the arms of the inverted V-shape opening downwards from \\( (0, 3) \\).\n\n**Visual Insight:** The overlapping region is where the area above \\( y = |x| \\) meets the area below \\( y = -|x| + 3 \\). Given the symmetry and the intersection points, the overlapping area forms a diamond shape (or rhombus) centered around the y-axis.\n\n**Action:** Let's confirm this by calculating the area of this diamond shape.\n\n## **Step 8: Calculating the Area of the Diamond Shape**\n\n**Method:** Use the formula for the area of a rhombus, which is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times d_1 \\times d_2\n\\]\nwhere \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_2 \\) are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\n**Observation:** From the intersection points, the diagonals of the diamond are aligned along the x-axis and y-axis.\n\n1. **Length of \\( d_1 \\) (vertical diagonal):**\n   - Connects (1.5, 1.5) and (-1.5, 1.5)\n   - Distance: \\( 1.5 - (-1.5) = 3 \\)\n\n2. **Length of \\( d_2 \\) (horizontal diagonal):**\n   - Connects points where \\( y = |x| \\) intersects \\( y = 1.5 \\):\n     - For \\( y = x \\): \\( x = 1.5 \\) \u21d2 Point (1.5, 1.5)\n     - For \\( y = -x \\): \\( x = -1.5 \\) \u21d2 Point (-1.5, 1.5)\n   - Therefore, \\( d_2 = 3 \\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 3 = \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5\n\\]\n**Reflection:** This area calculation makes sense given the symmetry of the diamond shape.\n\n**Check:** Does an area of 4.5 square units align with the boundaries and intersections? Yes, considering the diagonals and the vertices we've identified, the diamond's area is accurately represented by this calculation.\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying each step, I've concluded that the overlapping region is indeed a diamond shape with an area of **4.5 square units**.\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Starting with a graphical approach helped visualize the problem and identify key intersection points.\n\n- **Strategy Reflection:** Combining graphical insights with algebraic calculations ensured accuracy in defining the region and calculating the area.\n\n- **Checkpoints:** Regularly checking the validity of intersection points and the shape of the overlapping region confirmed that the diamond shape was correct.\n\n- **Final Check:** The area calculation aligns with the identified diagonals, validating the result.\n\n**Conclusion:** The area of the region satisfying the given inequalities is \\( \\boxed{4.5} \\) square units.\n\n---\n\nBy writing out each step, reflecting on the methods, and checking the work along the way, I've ensured a thorough and accurate approach to solving the problem.",

Similarly, the other three angles between sides bounding the shaded region are also right angles. Since $AD=DC$ by symmetry, $ABCD$ is a square.
