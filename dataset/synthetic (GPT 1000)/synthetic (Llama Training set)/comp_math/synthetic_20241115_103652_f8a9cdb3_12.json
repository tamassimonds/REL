Let's tackle this problem by thinking through it step by step, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and adjusting our approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, it involves logarithms, ceilings (\u23a1 \u23a4), and floors (\u23a3 \u23a6), which makes me think about properties of logarithms and integer ranges. Here's what comes to mind:\n\n- **Logarithm Basics:** I remember that \\(\\log_2 n\\) gives the power to which 2 must be raised to get n. So, \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\) rounds up to the nearest integer, and \\(\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor\\) rounds down.\n\n- **Range of Logarithms:** The values of \\(\\log_2 n\\) for \\(n\\) from 2 to 1000 range from 1 (since \\(\\log_2 2 = 1\\)) up to \\(\\log_2 1000\\). Calculating \\(\\log_2 1000\\) gives approximately 9.96578, so rounding up gives 10.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Calculate Each Step Individually:** Compute \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\) and \\(\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor\\) for each \\(n\\) from 2 to 1000 and sum them up.\n  2. **Analyze Patterns:** Look for patterns in the values of \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\) and \\(\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor\\) to see if there's a recurring difference.\n  3. **Use Logarithmic Identities:** Apply properties of logarithms to simplify the sum.\n\nHmm, calculating each one individually seems tedious, especially for larger numbers. Maybe there's a pattern that can help. Let's explore the second strategy first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Patterns in Logarithm Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI suspect there's a pattern in how \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\) and \\(\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor\\) differ. Specifically, the difference might be 1 for most numbers, except where \\(n\\) is a power of 2.\n\n**Initial Approach:**\n\n- **Compute for Powers of 2:** Check \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\) and \\(\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor\\) when \\(n\\) is a power of 2.\n  \n  - Example: \\(n = 2^k\\)\n    - \\(\\log_2 (2^k) = k\\)\n    - \\(\\lceil \\log_2 (2^k) \\rceil = k\\)\n    - \\(\\lfloor \\log_2 (2^k) \\rfloor = k\\)\n    - Difference \\(A - B = 0\\)\n\n- **Compute for Non-Powers of 2:** Check for \\(n\\) between powers of 2.\n  \n  - Example: \\(n = 2^k + m\\) where \\(1 \\leq m < 2^k\\)\n    - \\(\\log_2 n\\) is between \\(k\\) and \\(k+1\\)\n    - \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil = k + 1\\)\n    - \\(\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor = k\\)\n    - Difference \\(A - B = 1\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis pattern suggests that for non-powers of 2, \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\) is one more than \\(\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor\\). For powers of 2, they are equal.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this hold for all \\(n\\) from 2 to 1000? Let's verify with a few examples.\n\n- \\(n = 4\\) (power of 2):\n  - \\(\\log_2 4 = 2\\)\n  - \\(\\lceil 2 \\rceil = 2\\), \\(\\lfloor 2 \\rfloor = 2\\)\n  - Difference = 0\n\n- \\(n = 6\\) (non-power of 2):\n  - \\(\\log_2 6 \\approx 2.58496\\)\n  - \\(\\lceil 2.58496 \\rceil = 3\\), \\(\\lfloor 2.58496 \\rfloor = 2\\)\n  - Difference = 1\n\nThe pattern seems consistent. Let's proceed with this observation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Pattern to Calculate \\(A - B\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf the difference between \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\) and \\(\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor\\) is 1 for non-powers of 2, and 0 for powers of 2, I need to count how many numbers in the range 2 to 1000 are powers of 2 and how many are not.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Count Powers of 2 from 2 to 1000:**\n   - Powers of 2: \\(2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \\ldots, 2^{10}\\)\n   - Since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) exceeds 1000, we consider up to \\(2^9 = 512\\).\n   - Total: 9 powers of 2 (\\(2^1\\) to \\(2^9\\))\n\n2. **Total Numbers from 2 to 1000:**\n   - Total numbers = 999 - 2 + 1 = 999\n\n3. **Non-Powers of 2:**\n   - Non-powers of 2 = Total numbers - Powers of 2 = 999 - 9 = 990\n\n**Solution:**\n\nUsing the pattern:\n- For each non-power of 2, the difference \\(A - B = 1\\).\n- For each power of 2, the difference \\(A - B = 0\\).\n\nTherefore,\n\\[\nA - B = 1 \\times \\text{(number of non-powers of 2)} + 0 \\times \\text{(number of powers of 2)} = 1 \\times 990 + 0 \\times 9 = 990\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach seems logical. By counting the powers of 2 and recognizing where the difference occurs, we can efficiently calculate \\(A - B\\) without needing to sum each logarithm individually.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet's verify with a small sample to ensure the pattern holds:\n\n- For \\(n = 8\\) (power of 2):\n  - \\(\\log_2 8 = 3\\)\n  - \\(\\lceil 3 \\rceil = 3\\), \\(\\lfloor 3 \\rfloor = 3\\)\n  - Difference = 0\n\n- For \\(n = 10\\) (non-power of 2):\n  - \\(\\log_2 10 \\approx 3.32193\\)\n  - \\(\\lceil 3.32193 \\rceil = 4\\), \\(\\lfloor 3.32193 \\rfloor = 3\\)\n  - Difference = 1\n\nThe pattern holds true.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nBy recognizing the pattern in how logarithm ceilings and floors differ based on whether \\(n\\) is a power of 2, we were able to simplify the problem significantly. Instead of calculating each logarithm individually, we counted the powers of 2 and applied the pattern to find \\(A - B\\) efficiently.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nA - B = 990\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with initial brainstorming, pattern recognition, and reflection, allowed us to tackle the problem methodically and arrive at the correct solution.",
