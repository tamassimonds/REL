    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let\u2019s tackle this problem by thinking it through step by step, exploring different strategies, reflecting on their validity, and adjusting our approach as needed. It's just like how I would naturally work through a problem on paper, checking my work, and making sure I'm on the right path.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, **\"Determine the largest possible integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 942! \\) is divisible by \\( 15^n \\)\"**, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Factorization of 15:** I remember that \\( 15 = 3 \\times 5 \\). So, the problem is essentially about finding how many times \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\) multiply together in \\( 942! \\).\n\n2. **Divisibility in Factorials:** Factorials (like \\( 942! \\)) contain multiple instances of their base numbers, so I should consider how many times each prime factor appears.\n\n3. **Exponent Requirements:** To determine \\( n \\), I need to find the minimum exponent of \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\) that can form \\( 15^n \\). This makes me think I'll have to compare these two counts.\n\n4. **Initial Uncertainty:** I\u2019m not entirely sure how to count prime factors efficiently in a large factorial like \\( 942! \\). Maybe there's a formula or a method I can apply.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n- **Prime Factorization Approach:** Count the number of times \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\) appear in \\( 942! \\).\n\n- **Use of Legendre\u2019s Formula (or De Polignac\u2019s Formula):** This formula helps in counting the multiplicity of a prime in factorials.\n\n- **Simplification by Lower Primes:** Since \\( 15 = 3 \\times 5 \\), perhaps focusing on the multiplicity of \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\) separately makes the problem easier.\n\n- **Considering Higher Powers of Primes:** Ensure higher multiples (like \\( 9 \\) for \\( 3 \\) and \\( 25 \\) for \\( 5 \\)) are accounted for.\n\nI think the **Legendre\u2019s Formula** is the most systematic way to count the prime factors in a factorial, so I'll start with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Legendre\u2019s Formula**\n\nLet me recall Legendre\u2019s Formula:  \nTo find the exponent of a prime \\( p \\) in \\( n! \\), sum up the greatest integer divisions of \\( n \\) by \\( p^k \\) until \\( p^k \\) exceeds \\( n \\).\n\n**For Prime \\( 3 \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Exponent of } 3 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{3^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{3^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{3^4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{3^5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{3^6} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{3^7} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{3^8} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 314 \\)\n- \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{9} \\right\\rfloor = 104 \\)\n- \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{27} \\right\\rfloor = 34 \\)\n- \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{81} \\right\\rfloor = 11 \\)\n- \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{243} \\right\\rfloor = 3 \\)\n- \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{729} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\)\n- Higher powers (like \\( 3^7 = 2187 \\)) exceed \\( 942 \\), so they contribute \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Total Exponent of \\( 3 \\):**\n\n\\[\n314 + 104 + 34 + 11 + 3 + 1 = 467\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, does \\( 467 \\) seem reasonable? Given that \\( 3 \\) is a smaller prime, I expect a relatively high count. This number feels plausible, so I\u2019ll proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Legendre\u2019s Formula for Prime \\( 5 \\)**\n\nNow, let\u2019s do the same for prime \\( 5 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Exponent of } 5 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{5^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{5^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{5^4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{5^5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{5^6} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 188 \\)\n- \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 37 \\)\n- \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 7 \\)\n- \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{942}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\)\n- Higher powers (like \\( 5^6 = 3125 \\)) exceed \\( 942 \\), so they contribute \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Total Exponent of \\( 5 \\):**\n\n\\[\n188 + 37 + 7 + 1 = 233\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, \\( 942! \\) has \\( 233 \\) factors of \\( 5 \\). This seems smaller than the \\( 3 \\) count, which makes sense because \\( 5 \\) is larger, so fewer multiples exist in \\( 942! \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Largest \\( n \\)**\n\nNow, recall that \\( 15^n = 3^n \\times 5^n \\). To find the largest \\( n \\) such that both \\( 3^n \\) and \\( 5^n \\) divide \\( 942! \\), we need:\n\n\\[\nn \\leq \\text{min(exponent of } 3, \\text{ exponent of } 5)\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n\n- Exponent of \\( 3 \\) = \\( 467 \\)\n- Exponent of \\( 5 \\) = \\( 233 \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nn \\leq 233\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe largest possible integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 942! \\) is divisible by \\( 15^n \\) is ***\\( 233 \\)***.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Check**\n\n- **Checking Reasonableness:** The fact that \\( 3 \\) appears more frequently than \\( 5 \\) in \\( 942! \\) aligns with expectations since multiples of \\( 3 \\) are more common than multiples of \\( 5 \\).\n\n- **Method Verification:** Using Legendre\u2019s Formula is a systematic approach, and the calculations for both primes seem correct.\n\n- **Cross-Checking:** If \\( n = 233 \\), then \\( 15^{233} = (3 \\times 5)^{233} = 3^{233} \\times 5^{233} \\). \\( 942! \\) has enough factors of \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\) to support this.\n\nEverything checks out, and the approach feels solid. **Adding further thoughts**:\n\n- **Alternative Methods:** I considered initially counting all multiples of \\( 15 \\) in \\( 942! \\), but that would be less efficient since \\( 15 \\) itself is a composite number. Factoring into primes was indeed the better path.\n\n- **Potential Mistakes:** Initially, I thought about just counting multiples of \\( 15 \\), but then realized that wouldn\u2019t account for higher powers of \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\) that contribute extra factors.\n\n- **Learning Point:** This problem underscores the importance of breaking down composite factors into their prime components to accurately assess divisibility in factorials.\n\nOverall, the step-by-step approach, coupled with continuous reflection and verification, led us to confidently determine that the largest possible integer \\( n \\) is \\( 233 \\).\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough mimics a natural human thought process, complete with brainstorming, reflection, and checks, leading to a confident and correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $15 = 3^1 \\cdot 5^1$, the largest possible value of $n$ for which $15^n \\mid 942!$ is the largest possible value of $n$ for which both $3^n \\mid 942!$ and $5^n \\mid 942!$.  Since $942!$ has many more factors of 3 than it does 5, our answer will be the number of factors of 5 in $942!$. $$ \\frac{942}{5} = 188\\frac{2}{5} \\qquad \\frac{188}{5} = 37\\frac{3}{5} \\qquad \\frac{37}{5} = 7\\frac{2}{5} \\qquad \\frac{7}{5} = 1\\frac{2}{5} $$There are $188 + 37 + 7 + 1 = 233$ factors of 5 in $942!$, so the largest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{233}$."
