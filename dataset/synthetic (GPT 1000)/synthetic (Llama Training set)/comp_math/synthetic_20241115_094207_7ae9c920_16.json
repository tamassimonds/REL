    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem step by step, embracing the natural thought process, including brainstorming, reflecting, checking for correctness, and adjusting strategies as needed. I'll document my journey as authentically as possible, capturing real-time reflections and adjustments. Here we go:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming the Problem**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I see that Steve has three of each type of coin: quarters, nickels, and pennies. He's selecting three coins at random without replacement, and we need to find the probability that their total value is exactly 35 cents.\n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n- **Total Combinations:** Maybe I should start by determining the total number of ways to select three coins out of the nine.\n- **Desired Outcomes:** Then, identify all the combinations that sum up to 35 cents.\n- **Probability Calculation:** Finally, calculate the probability by dividing the favorable outcomes by the total outcomes.\n\nBut wait, is there a more straightforward way? Perhaps focusing directly on combinations that add up to 35 cents would be more efficient.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Total Combinations**\n\nLet's begin by calculating the total number of ways to select three coins out of nine.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Combinations} = \\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 84\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \nSo, there are 84 possible ways to pick three coins. This sets the denominator for our probability. That part seems straightforward.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Combinations that Total 35 Cents**\n\nNow, I need to figure out which combinations of three coins sum up to 35 cents. Let's think about the possible coin combinations:\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n- **One Quarter + Other Coins:** Since a quarter is 25 cents, adding two more coins to reach 35 cents seems plausible.\n- **Multiple Quarters:** Perhaps using more than one quarter could work, but three quarters alone are 75 cents, so that's too much.\n- **No Quarters:** Maybe combinations without quarters could work, but reaching 35 cents without a quarter seems unlikely.\n\n**Wait a Moment:** \nLet me list down potential combinations involving at least one quarter, as that seems necessary to reach 35 cents.\n\n#### **Exploring Combinations:**\n\n1. **One Quarter (25\u00a2) + Two Nickels (10\u00a2):**\n   - Total: 25\u00a2 + 10\u00a2 = 35\u00a2\n\n2. **One Quarter (25\u00a2) + One Nickel (5\u00a2) + One Penny (1\u00a2):**\n   - Total: 25\u00a2 + 5\u00a2 + 1\u00a2 = 31\u00a2 \n   - **Correction Needed:** Wait, that adds up to 31\u00a2, not 35\u00a2. \n   - **Realization:** Adding a penny only increases by 1\u00a2; I need 10\u00a2 to jump from 25\u00a2 to 35\u00a2.\n   \n   **Alternative:** Perhaps adding multiple pennies could work, but since I only have three pennies, this doesn't help.\n\n3. **Trying with Two Quarters:**\n   - **Two Quarters (50\u00a2):** Already exceeds 35\u00a2 with just two coins.\n   \n4. **No Quarters:**\n   - **Three Nickels and Pennies:** \n     - **Three Nickels (15\u00a2) + Three Pennies (3\u00a2):** Total is 18\u00a2, far from 35\u00a2.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** \n   Without a quarter, it's impossible to reach 35\u00a2.\n\n**Aha Moment:**\nIt seems the only viable combination is **one quarter and two nickels**.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Probability of the Favorable Combination**\n\nNow that I've identified the only combination that works (one quarter and two nickels), I need to calculate how many ways this specific combination can occur.\n\n**Breaking It Down:**\n- **Selecting One Quarter:** There are three quarters available.\n- **Selecting Two Nickels:** There are three nickels available.\n\nSo, the number of ways to select one quarter and two nickels is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to Select One Quarter} = \\binom{3}{1} = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to Select Two Nickels} = \\binom{3}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total Favorable Combinations} = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThat makes sense. For each quarter selected, there are three possible pairs of nickels to accompany it.\n\n### **Step 4: Computing the Probability**\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable combinations by the total number of combinations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Favorable Combinations}}{\\text{Total Combinations}} = \\frac{9}{84}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{84} = \\frac{9 \\div 3}{84 \\div 3} = \\frac{3}{28}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Check: Validating the Approach**\n\nBefore concluding, let's verify if this approach makes sense:\n\n- **Total Combinations:** Correctly calculated as 84.\n- **Identified Favorable Combination:** Only one valid combination (one quarter and two nickels) that sums to 35\u00a2.\n- **Calculated Favorable Outcomes:** 9 ways to achieve this combination.\n- **Probability Calculation:** Simplified to \\(\\frac{3}{28}\\).\n\n**Conclusion:** \nEverything checks out. The probability that Steve selects three coins totaling 35 cents is **\\(\\frac{3}{28}\\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{28}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nInitially, I considered multiple strategies, but through exploration, it became clear that only one specific combination worked. By systematically calculating each part, I ensured accuracy in the final probability. Embracing a step-by-step approach helped in identifying and correcting potential missteps along the way.",

  "ground_truth": "There are a total of ${9 \\choose 3} = \\frac{9\\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{3 \\cdot 2} = 84$ sets of 3 coins in total. The only way to get 35 cents is to have a quarter and two nickels, which can be done in ${3 \\choose 1} \\cdot {3 \\choose 2} = 9$ ways. So, the probability is $\\frac{9}{84} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{28}}$."
