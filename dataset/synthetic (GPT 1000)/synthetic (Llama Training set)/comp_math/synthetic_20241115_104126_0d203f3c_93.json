    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my thoughts, and check my work as I go, just like I would if I'm solving it manually.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, the problem asks for the value of \\( |a - b| + a + b \\) given that \\( a < b \\). \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like it's dealing with absolute values and combining terms. Absolute values can be tricky because they involve distance, but since \\( a < b \\), I think \\( |a - b| \\) will just be \\( b - a \\). Does that sound right?\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. Direct substitution using the property of absolute values.\n  2. Simplifying the expression by substituting \\( |a - b| = b - a \\).\n  3. Maybe factor out common terms to see if something simplifies nicely.\n\nI think starting with substituting \\( |a - b| \\) is a good way to begin. If that leads to a straightforward answer, great. If not, I can explore other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Absolute Value Property**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince \\( a < b \\), the difference \\( a - b \\) is negative. The absolute value will convert it to positive. So, I think:\n\n\\[\n|a - b| = b - a\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\nSubstituting this into the expression:\n\n\\[\n|a - b| + a + b = (b - a) + a + b\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**\nLet's combine like terms:\n\n\\[\n(b - a) + a + b = b - a + a + b = 2b\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, let me double-check. Adding \\( b - a \\) and \\( a + b \\) should indeed give me \\( 2b \\). This seems correct because the \\( -a \\) and \\( +a \\) cancel each other out.\n\n**Check:**\n- Does the result make sense? Yes, because we're left with just \\( 2b \\).\n- Is there any dependency on the value of \\( a \\) other than \\( a < b \\)? No, the \\( a \\) terms cancel out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nEven though the direct substitution worked, let's brainstorm if there's another method to verify this result.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy 1:** Factor the expression differently.\n- **Alternative Strategy 2:** Plug in specific values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to see if the formula holds.\n\n**Trying Alternative Strategy 2:**\nLet's pick specific values, say \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 5 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n|a - b| + a + b = |2 - 5| + 2 + 5 = | -3 | + 2 + 5 = 3 + 2 + 5 = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, according to our earlier simplification:\n\n\\[\n2b = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nBoth methods give the same result, \\( 10 \\). This confirms that our initial approach was correct.\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this work for any \\( a < b \\)? Let's think: If \\( a < b \\), then \\( b - a \\) is always positive, so \\( 2b \\) makes sense as a general solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore concluding, let's ensure that the substitution and simplification are universally valid given the condition \\( a < b \\).\n\n- **Key Insight:** The condition \\( a < b \\) ensures that \\( |a - b| = b - a \\). Without this, the absolute value could behave differently.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **General Case:** For any \\( a < b \\), \\( |a - b| = b - a \\) holds true.\n- **Expression Simplification:** Adding \\( b - a \\) to \\( a + b \\) always results in \\( 2b \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The approach is consistent, and the result is validated through both direct calculation and a specific example.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies and verifying our work through multiple methods, the value of \\( |a - b| + a + b \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2b}\n\\]\n\nThis final expression correctly represents the solution, simplified as much as possible, and is dependent solely on \\( b \\), regardless of the specific value of \\( a \\) (as long as \\( a < b \\)).",
