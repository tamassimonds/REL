    "working_out": "Sure! Let me tackle this problem step by step, just like I would when solving it manually. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether each approach is working, and adjust my methods as needed. I'll also write down my thought process extensively, including any doubts or realizations, to ensure clarity and correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**Find all \\( p \\) which satisfy both the inequalities \\( 0 \\ge 54p - 144 \\) and \\( 0 > 12 - 20p \\). Express your answer in interval notation, reducing any fractions in your answer.**\n\nI'm thinking:\n\n- **Inequalities:** This reminds me of solving linear inequalities, which is similar to solving equations but requires careful attention to the direction of the inequality when multiplying or dividing by negative numbers.\n- **Simultaneous Inequalities:** I realize I need to solve both inequalities simultaneously. This typically means finding the **intersection** of their solution sets.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Solve Each Inequality Separately:** Find the solution set for each inequality and then determine where these sets overlap.\n  2. **Graphical Approach:** Visualizing the inequalities on a number line to see where they intersect.\n  3. **Substitution:** Use one inequality to substitute into the other, though this might not be straightforward with inequalities.\n\nAt this point, I think the **first strategy** \u2014 solving each inequality separately and then finding their intersection \u2014 makes the most sense. Let me proceed with that and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Solve the First Inequality \\( 0 \\ge 54p - 144 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This inequality is straightforward. I need to isolate \\( p \\).\n- I remember that to isolate \\( p \\), I'll add 144 to both sides and then divide by 54.\n- Wait, let me check if dividing by a positive number like 54 will change the direction of the inequality. No, it won't, because 54 is positive.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[ \n0 \\ge 54p - 144 \n\\]\n\nAdd 144 to both sides:\n\n\\[ \n144 \\ge 54p \n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 54:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{144}{54} \\ge p \n\\]\n\n**Simplify the Fraction:**\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{144 \\div 6}{54 \\div 6} = \\frac{24}{9} \n\\]\n\nFurther simplify:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{24 \\div 3}{9 \\div 3} = \\frac{8}{3} \n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \np \\le \\frac{8}{3} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- That seems correct. Dividing by 54 preserves the inequality direction since 54 is positive.\n- **Check:** \\( \\frac{144}{54} = \\frac{24}{9} = \\frac{8}{3} \\). Simplification looks good.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solve the Second Inequality \\( 0 > 12 - 20p \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This inequality also looks straightforward. I'll need to isolate \\( p \\) again.\n- I recall that when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the inequality direction flips. Here, I'll be dividing by -20, so I need to flip the inequality sign.\n- Let's proceed with these steps.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[ \n0 > 12 - 20p \n\\]\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n\\[ \n0 - 12 > -20p \n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \n-12 > -20p \n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by -20 **and flip the inequality:**\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{-12}{-20} < p \n\\]\n\n**Simplify the Fraction:**\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{-12 \\div 4}{-20 \\div 4} = \\frac{3}{5} \n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \np > \\frac{3}{5} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Dividing by a negative number (-20) flipped the inequality, which is crucial.\n- The fraction simplifies correctly: \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n- Everything seems correct so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Find the Intersection of the Two Solution Sets**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, I need to find where the two inequalities overlap, i.e., the values of \\( p \\) that satisfy both \\( p \\le \\frac{8}{3} \\) and \\( p > \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n- This is essentially finding the **intersection** of the two intervals.\n- I remember that when dealing with inequalities, the solution set is typically an **interval** on the number line.\n- Let me visualize this to ensure I'm correct.\n\n**Interval Representation:**\n\n1. **From \\( p \\le \\frac{8}{3} \\):** This represents all values less than or equal to \\( \\frac{8}{3} \\).\n2. **From \\( p > \\frac{3}{5} \\):** This represents all values greater than \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n\n**Intersection:**\n\n- The overlapping region is where \\( p \\) is greater than \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) and less than or equal to \\( \\frac{8}{3} \\).\n- In interval notation, this is:\n\n\\[ \n\\left( \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{8}{3} \\right] \n\\]\n\n**Visualization:**\n\n- On a number line:\n  - **\\( \\frac{3}{5} \\):** Open circle, since \\( p \\) cannot equal \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n  - **\\( \\frac{8}{3} \\):** Closed circle, since \\( p \\) can equal \\( \\frac{8}{3} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** The interval makes sense because we're looking for \\( p \\) values that satisfy both inequalities simultaneously.\n- I feel confident that this is the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe set of all \\( p \\) that satisfy both inequalities is:\n\n\\[ \np \\in \\left( \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{8}{3} \\right] \n\\]\n\n**Interval Notation:**\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{8}{3} \\right] \\)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Validation:** Solving each inequality separately and finding their intersection worked well.\n- **Mistakes Checked:** Initially, I considered whether to use a graphical approach, which could be helpful but wasn't necessary here. Also, ensuring the inequality direction flipped correctly when dividing by a negative number was crucial.\n- **Outcome Confirmation:** The final interval correctly represents all \\( p \\) values satisfying both inequalities.\n- **Thought Process:** Throughout, I ensured each step logically followed the previous one, constantly checking if the approach was correct before proceeding.\n\n---\n\nBy following this detailed, step-by-step approach, I was able to arrive at the correct solution while reflecting and adjusting strategies as needed, just like a human would naturally think through and solve a problem.",

Adding $144$ to both sides of the first inequality, we get $$144\\ge 54p,$$implying $$\\frac{144}{54}\\ge p.$$Reducing the fraction and switching the sides (along with the direction of the inequality), we get $p\\le\\frac{8}{3}$.\n\n\nTo solve the second inequality, we add $20p$ to both sides: $$20p > 12$$Dividing both sides by $20$, we get $$p>\\frac{12}{20}.$$Reducing the fraction gives $p>\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\n\nWe are looking for $p$ which satisfy both inequalities. The intersection of the solutions above is $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{3}{5},\\frac{8}{3}\\right]}$."
