    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, reflecting and checking along the way to ensure we're on the right track. I'll brainstorm different strategies, write down initial thoughts, reconsider approaches if something doesn't seem right, and make sure to check the work frequently. This should mimic a human thought process as closely as possible.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Different Cases:** The function \\( f(x) \\) has two cases: one for rational \\( x \\) and another for irrational \\( x \\). This immediately reminds me of functions that handle rational and irrational numbers separately, like the floor and ceiling functions.\n  \n- **Absolute Value and Squaring:** The use of \\( |\\lfloor x \\rfloor| \\) for rational \\( x \\) and \\( \\lceil x \\rceil^2 \\) for irrational \\( x \\) seems straightforward, but combining these with the floor and ceiling functions might introduce some complexity.\n\n- **Specific Inputs:** We're asked to evaluate \\( f \\) at four specific points: \\( \\sqrt[3]{-8} \\), \\( -\\pi \\), \\( \\sqrt{50} \\), and \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\). It's clear that these inputs vary between rational and irrational, which is crucial since the function definition depends on this distinction.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Determine Rationality:** The first step for each input is to determine whether it's rational or irrational. This will dictate which case of \\( f(x) \\) to apply.\n\n2. **Apply Floor and Ceiling Functions:** Once the rationality is established, the next step is to compute the floor or ceiling of each input as required.\n\n3. **Incorporate Absolute Value and Squaring:** Finally, apply the absolute value or square as specified in the function definition.\n\n4. **Sum the Values:** After calculating \\( f \\) for each individual input, sum them up to find the final answer.\n\n### **Reflection on Initial Thoughts**\n\n- **Rationality Check:** At first, I think determining whether each number is rational or irrational is straightforward, but I should double-check to ensure I don't misclassify any input.\n\n- **Floor/Ceiling Confusion:** I'm slightly uncertain about accurately applying floor and ceiling functions, especially with negatives and roots. Maybe recalling how these functions work will help.\n\n- **Absolute and Squared Values:** The order of operations regarding absolute values and squaring seems clear, but I should ensure there's no ambiguity in applying them.\n\nLet me **start by determining the rationality** of each input.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing \\( \\sqrt[3]{-8} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Cube Root of a Negative Integer:** I recall that the cube root of an integer, even if negative, is an integer. Specifically, \\( \\sqrt[3]{-8} = -2 \\).\n\n- **Rationality:** Since \\( -2 \\) is an integer, it's obviously a rational number.\n\n**Check:** Does \\( \\sqrt[3]{-8} = -2 \\)? Yes, because \\( (-2)^3 = -8 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:** \\( \\sqrt[3]{-8} \\) is rational.\n\n**Determining \\( f(\\sqrt[3]{-8}) \\):**\n\n- **Function Case:** Since \\( x \\) is rational, use \\( f(x) = |\\lfloor x \\rfloor| \\).\n\n- **Applying Floor:** \\( \\lfloor -2 \\rfloor = -2 \\).\n\n- **Absolute Value:** \\( |-2| = 2 \\).\n\n**Result:** \\( f(\\sqrt[3]{-8}) = 2 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing \\( -\\pi \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Well-Known Irrational Number:** I recognize \\( \\pi \\) as an irrational number, and therefore \\( -\\pi \\) is also irrational.\n\n- **Rationality:** Confirming that \\( -\\pi \\) is irrational aligns with my understanding since \\( \\pi \\) itself cannot be expressed as a fraction.\n\n**Check:** Is \\( -\\pi \\) irrational? Yes.\n\n**Conclusion:** \\( -\\pi \\) is irrational.\n\n**Determining \\( f(-\\pi) \\):**\n\n- **Function Case:** Since \\( x \\) is irrational, use \\( f(x) = \\lceil x \\rceil^2 \\).\n\n- **Applying Ceiling:** Need to find \\( \\lceil -\\pi \\rceil \\).\n  - Recall that \\( -\\pi \\approx -3.14159 \\).\n  - The smallest integer greater than \\( -\\pi \\) is \\( -3 \\).\n\n- **Squaring:** \\( (-3)^2 = 9 \\).\n\n**Result:** \\( f(-\\pi) = 9 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing \\( \\sqrt{50} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Square Root of an Integer:** I know that \\( \\sqrt{50} \\) simplifies to \\( \\sqrt{25 \\times 2} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n- **Rationality:** The square root of 2 (\\( \\sqrt{2} \\)) is irrational, so multiplying by 5 doesn't change that. Thus, \\( \\sqrt{50} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\) is irrational.\n\n**Check:** Is \\( \\sqrt{50} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\) irrational? Yes, since \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is irrational.\n\n**Conclusion:** \\( \\sqrt{50} \\) is irrational.\n\n**Determining \\( f(\\sqrt{50}) \\):**\n\n- **Function Case:** Since \\( x \\) is irrational, use \\( f(x) = \\lceil x \\rceil^2 \\).\n\n- **Applying Ceiling:** Need to find \\( \\lceil \\sqrt{50} \\rceil \\).\n  - Since \\( \\sqrt{50} \\approx 7.07107 \\), the smallest integer greater than \\( \\sqrt{50} \\) is \\( 8 \\).\n\n- **Squaring:** \\( 8^2 = 64 \\).\n\n**Result:** \\( f(\\sqrt{50}) = 64 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Analyzing \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Simple Fraction:** \\( \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \\), which is a rational number because it's a fraction of two integers.\n\n- **Rationality:** Confirming that \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\) is rational aligns with basic properties of numbers.\n\n**Check:** Is \\( \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \\) rational? Yes.\n\n**Conclusion:** \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\) is rational.\n\n**Determining \\( f\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right) \\):**\n\n- **Function Case:** Since \\( x \\) is rational, use \\( f(x) = |\\lfloor x \\rfloor| \\).\n\n- **Applying Floor:** \\( \\lfloor 4.5 \\rfloor = 4 \\).\n\n- **Absolute Value:** \\( |4| = 4 \\).\n\n**Result:** \\( f\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right) = 4 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Summing the Results**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Adding Up Individual \\( f \\) Values:** Now that I have \\( f(x) \\) for each input, I can simply sum them up to find the total.\n\n- **Confirming No Overlooked Cases:** Since all inputs were either rational or irrational, and each was processed accordingly, I feel confident moving forward.\n\n**Check:** Does adding these make sense? Yes, all cases were correctly identified and calculated.\n\n**Calculation:** \n\\[\nf(\\sqrt[3]{-8}) + f(-\\pi) + f(\\sqrt{50}) + f\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right) = 2 + 9 + 64 + 4 = 79\n\\]\n\n**Result:** The sum is **79**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Verification:** By addressing each input separately based on its rationality, and applying the appropriate function definition, the steps logically lead to the correct answer.\n\n- **Correctness Check:** Throughout, each input's classification and subsequent calculations were verified. There were no missteps or misclassifications.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Initially considered exploring properties of rational and irrational floors and ceilings more abstractly but decided straightforward calculations were clearer and more reliable.\n\n- **Mistake Acknowledgment:** Initially, I double-checked the floor and ceiling applications to avoid common pitfalls, like misapplying these functions with negative numbers.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{79}\\)",

  "ground_truth": "Since we know that $\\sqrt[3]{-8}=-2$ is a rational number, $$f(\\sqrt[3]{-8})=|\\lfloor{-2}\\rfloor|=2.$$Continuing from here, we know that $-\\pi$ is irrational, thus $$f(-\\pi)=\\lceil{-\\pi}\\rceil^2=(-3)^2=9.$$Because 50 is not a perfect square, $\\sqrt{50}$ must be irrational as well, so $$f(\\sqrt{50})=\\lceil{\\sqrt{50}}\\rceil^2=8^2=64.$$Finally, we know that $\\frac{9}{2}$ is a rational number, so $$f\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)=\\left|\\left\\lfloor{\\frac92}\\right\\rfloor\\right|=4.$$Therefore $$f(\\sqrt[3]{-8})+f(-\\pi)+f(\\sqrt{50})+f\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)=2+9+64+4=\\boxed{79}.$$"
