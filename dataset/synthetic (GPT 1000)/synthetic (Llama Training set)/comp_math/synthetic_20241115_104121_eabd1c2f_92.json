    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and adjust my approach as needed \u2013 just like I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the function \\( f(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n5x^2 + 2 & \\text{if } x \\leq a, \\\\\n11x & \\text{if } x > a.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nI think, **\"Hmm, this looks like a piecewise function.\"** Immediately, I recall that for the graph to be continuous, the two pieces must connect seamlessly at \\( x = a \\). This reminds me of problems where you have to ensure the left-hand limit equals the right-hand limit at a particular point.\n\nBut then I wonder, **\"Wait, is continuity the only requirement here? What about differentiability?\"** The question only asks for continuity, so I can focus solely on that. Differentiability would be an extra condition but isn't necessary for this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Continuity Condition at \\( x = a \\):**\n   - The most straightforward approach: Set the two expressions equal at \\( x = a \\).\n   - This should ensure that there\u2019s no jump or break in the graph at that point.\n\n2. **Check Left-Hand and Right-Hand Limits:**\n   - Compute \\( \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) \\) and \\( \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) \\).\n   - Ensure these limits are equal to maintain continuity.\n\n3. **Explore Different Values of \\( a \\):**\n   - Start by testing simple values like \\( a = 0, 1, -1 \\) to see how they fit.\n   - Adjust based on whether continuity is satisfied.\n\n4. **Algebraic Manipulation:**\n   - Solve the equation \\( 5a^2 + 2 = 11a \\) derived from setting the two pieces equal.\n   - This should give a specific value for \\( a \\).\n\nI think the **continuity condition at \\( x = a \\)** is the most direct method, so I'll start there. If it feels off, I\u2019ll reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Continuity Condition**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo ensure continuity at \\( x = a \\), the value of \\( f(x) \\) from both sides must be the same. So, I set the two expressions equal:\n\n\\[\n5a^2 + 2 = 11a\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubtract \\( 11a \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n5a^2 + 2 - 11a = 0 \\\\\n5a^2 - 11a + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThat looks like a quadratic equation, which I can solve using the quadratic formula. But before jumping in, I\u2019ll check if this equation can be factored for an easier solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting to Factor the Quadratic**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet me see if \\( 5a^2 - 11a + 2 \\) can be factored into two binomials. If it can, that would be a quicker way to find the roots.\n\n**Checking for Factors:**\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\) and add up to \\( -11 \\).\n\nPossible pairs: \\( (-10, -1) \\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s try factoring:\n\n\\[\n5a^2 - 11a + 2 = (5a - 1)(a - 2)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, let me multiply these factors to verify:\n\n\\[\n(5a - 1)(a - 2) = 5a^2 - 10a - a + 2 = 5a^2 - 11a + 2\n\\]\n\nAh, it matches perfectly! So, the factoring works.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis gives me two possible solutions for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[\n5a - 1 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = \\frac{1}{5} \\\\\na - 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = 2\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering the Smallest Possible Value for \\( a \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe problem asks for the **smallest** possible value of \\( a \\) that makes the graph continuous. From the solutions \\( a = \\frac{1}{5} \\) and \\( a = 2 \\), the smallest value is \\( a = \\frac{1}{5} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nLet me double-check by plugging \\( a = \\frac{1}{5} \\) back into the original continuity condition to ensure it satisfies both pieces.\n\n**Verification:**\n\nFor \\( x \\leq \\frac{1}{5} \\):\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 5\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^2 + 2 = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{25} + 2 = \\frac{1}{5} + 2 = \\frac{11}{5}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( x > \\frac{1}{5} \\):\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 11 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{11}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth pieces yield \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = \\frac{11}{5} \\), so the continuity condition is satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Quick Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, let's quickly verify if \\( a = \\frac{1}{5} \\) indeed is the smallest value that makes the function continuous.\n\n**Reflection:**\nI already factored the quadratic and confirmed that both solutions are valid. Since \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) is less than \\( 2 \\), it\u2019s the smallest possible value.\n\n**Random Insight:**\nAlso, considering the nature of the quadratic equation and the fact that it opens upwards (since the coefficient of \\( a^2 \\) is positive), there are only two real roots, and both have been found.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying through factoring, and ensuring the continuity condition holds, the smallest possible value for \\( a \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Starting with the continuity condition was effective. Attempting to factor the quadratic made the solution process smoother.\n- **Checking Work:** Verifying by plugging \\( a = \\frac{1}{5} \\) back into both pieces ensured correctness.\n- **Alternative Methods:** Thinking about testing different \\( a \\) values provided insight but wasn\u2019t necessary once the quadratic was factored successfully.\n- **Potential Mistakes:** Initially considering whether differentiability was required added unnecessary complexity. Focusing solely on continuity was correct.\n\nOverall, this step-by-step approach, with constant reflection and verification, led to the correct and most straightforward solution.",
