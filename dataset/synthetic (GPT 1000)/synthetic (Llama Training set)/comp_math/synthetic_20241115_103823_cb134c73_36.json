    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle this probability problem step by step, thinking through it just like I would if I were working on it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether each approach makes sense, and continuously check my work to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n- **Max** and **Zack** both spin a spinner with different probabilities for landing on each number (1, 2, 3, and 4).\n- I need to find the probability that Max gets a larger number than Zack.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Similar Problems:** This reminds me of probability problems involving comparing outcomes, like finding the likelihood one random variable exceeds another.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **List All Outcomes:** Maybe I can list all possible combinations of Max's and Zack's spins and see how many have Max's number larger than Zack's.\n  - **Probability Tree:** A probability tree diagram could help visualize all possible outcomes.\n  - **Conditional Probabilities:** Perhaps calculating the probability conditionally based on each outcome.\n  - **Complementary Probability:** Calculate the probability that Max\u2019s number is not larger (i.e., equal to or smaller) and subtract from 1.\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\n\nListing all outcomes seems doable but might get messy with different probabilities for each number. A probability tree could work, but it might be overkill. The complementary probability approach sounds efficient\u2014calculate the probability that Max's number is **not** larger (i.e., Zack's number is equal to or larger) and subtract from 1.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI think using the complementary probability is a smart way to simplify the problem. It allows me to focus on fewer scenarios (Max's number is equal to or smaller than Zack's) rather than all possible cases where Max's number is larger.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Sample Space**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore diving into calculations, let's clearly define the sample space:\n\n- Both Max and Zack spin the same spinner.\n- Max's outcome is independent of Zack's.\n- Possible outcomes for both are {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\n**Checking:**\n\nIs there anything I'm missing here? No, I think this defines the sample space well.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, moving forward with this sample space.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Total Probability Calculation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo use the complementary probability method, I need to calculate the total probability of all possible outcomes.\n\n- Max's probabilities:\n  - P(1) = $\\frac{1}{2}$\n  - P(2) = $\\frac{1}{4}$\n  - P(3) = $\\frac{1}{6}$\n  - P(4) = $\\frac{1}{12}$\n\n**Wait...**\n\nLet me quickly check if these probabilities add up to 1:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{6}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} + \\frac{2}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{12}{12} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nPerfect! The probabilities sum up to 1, so they're valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Probability of Max's Number Not Being Larger**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that Max's number is **not** larger than Zack's, i.e.,:\n\n- Max's number is equal to Zack's number.\n- Max's number is smaller than Zack's number.\n\nLet's break this down.\n\n#### **3.1: Probability Max's Number Equals Zack's Number**\n\n**Approach:**\n\nCalculate the probability for each possible number where Max's and Zack's numbers are equal, then sum these probabilities.\n\n- **Both Spin 1:**\n  \\[\n  P(1, 1) = P(\\text{Max spins 1}) \\times P(\\text{Zack spins 1}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Both Spin 2:**\n  \\[\n  P(2, 2) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{16}\n  \\]\n\n- **Both Spin 3:**\n  \\[\n  P(3, 3) = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{36}\n  \\]\n\n- **Both Spin 4:**\n  \\[\n  P(4, 4) = \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right) = \\frac{1}{144}\n  \\]\n\n**Wait...**\n\nLet me add these up to ensure they're correct:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{1}{144}\n\\]\n\n**Common Denominator:**\n\nThe least common multiple of 4, 16, 36, and 144 is 144.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{36}{144}, \\quad \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{9}{144}, \\quad \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{4}{144}, \\quad \\frac{1}{144} = \\frac{1}{144}\n\\]\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{144} + \\frac{9}{144} + \\frac{4}{144} + \\frac{1}{144} = \\frac{50}{144} = \\frac{25}{72}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis probability makes sense. It's less than 1, and the calculations seem correct.\n\n#### **3.2: Probability Max's Number Is Smaller Than Zack's Number**\n\n**Approach:**\n\nFor this, I need to consider all combinations where Max's number is less than Zack's. It might be easier to calculate the total probability of Max's number being larger or equal and subtract the probability of them being equal.\n\n**Wait...**\n\nSince I already calculated the probability of them being equal ($\\frac{25}{72}$), I can use that to simplify my calculations.\n\n**So, let's calculate the total probability of Max's number being larger or equal:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Probability} = 1 \\quad (\\text{since all probabilities add up to 1})\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Max's number } \\geq \\text{ Zack's number}) = P(\\text{Equal}) + P(\\text{Larger})\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Larger}) = P(\\text{Max's number } \\geq \\text{ Zack's number}) - P(\\text{Equal}) = 1 - \\frac{25}{72} = \\frac{72}{72} - \\frac{25}{72} = \\frac{47}{72}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat seems a bit tricky. Let me verify this approach. By subtracting the probability of them being equal from the total probability, I should get the probability that Max's number is larger.\n\n**But wait...**\n\nThis method seems to have mixed up the probabilities. I think I need to recalculate differently.\n\n**Reconsideration:**\n\nLet me list all scenarios where Max's number is smaller than Zack's and calculate the probabilities directly.\n\n#### **3.3: Listing All Scenarios Where Max's Number Is Smaller**\n\n**Approach:**\n\nI'll consider each possible outcome for Zack and sum the probabilities where Max's number is less.\n\n- **Zack Spins 2:**\n  - Max can only spin 1.\n  \n  \\[\n  P(1, 2) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{8}\n  \\]\n\n- **Zack Spins 3:**\n  - Max can spin 1 or 2.\n  \n  \\[\n  P(1, 3) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{12}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  P(2, 3) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{24}\n  \\]\n  \n  Total for Zack spinning 3:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{2}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{3}{24} = \\frac{1}{8}\n  \\]\n\n- **Zack Spins 4:**\n  - Max can spin 1, 2, or 3.\n  \n  \\[\n  P(1, 4) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right) = \\frac{1}{24}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  P(2, 4) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right) = \\frac{1}{48}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  P(3, 4) = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right) = \\frac{1}{72}\n  \\]\n  \n  Total for Zack spinning 4:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{24} + \\frac{1}{48} + \\frac{1}{72}\n  \\]\n  \n**Common Denominator:**\n\nThe least common multiple is 144.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{6}{144}, \\quad \\frac{1}{48} = \\frac{3}{144}, \\quad \\frac{1}{72} = \\frac{2}{144}\n\\]\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{144} + \\frac{3}{144} + \\frac{2}{144} = \\frac{11}{144}\n\\]\n\n**Total Probability That Max's Number Is Smaller:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Max's number } < \\text{ Zack's number}) = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{11}{144}\n\\]\n\n**Common Denominator:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{18}{144}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{144} + \\frac{18}{144} + \\frac{11}{144} = \\frac{47}{144}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis probability seems reasonable. It's less than 1, and the calculations are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Complementary Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that **Max's number is larger** than Zack's. Since probability must add up to 1, I can subtract the probability of Max's number being equal or smaller from 1.\n\n**Wait...**\n\nI noticed that earlier I tried to calculate the probability using a different approach, but it led to confusion. Let's stick with this reliable method.\n\n**So, let's calculate:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Max's number } > \\text{ Zack's number}) = 1 - P(\\text{Max's number } \\leq \\text{ Zack's number})\n\\]\n\nFrom Step 3.3, we have:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Max's number } < \\text{ Zack's number}) = \\frac{47}{144}\n\\]\n\nAnd the probability of them being equal is \\(\\frac{25}{72}\\), which is equivalent to \\(\\frac{50}{144}\\) when adjusted to the same denominator.\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Max's number } \\leq \\text{ Zack's number}) = P(\\text{Equal}) + P(\\text{Less}) = \\frac{50}{144} + \\frac{47}{144} = \\frac{97}{144}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Max's number } > \\text{ Zack's number}) = 1 - \\frac{97}{144} = \\frac{144}{144} - \\frac{97}{144} = \\frac{47}{144}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense. The probability that Max's number is larger than Zack's is \\(\\frac{47}{144}\\), which is a valid probability value between 0 and 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: **Final Check and Reflection\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, it's essential to quickly review each step to ensure the calculations are correct and the logic flows well.\n\n**Check 1: Sample Space Definition**\n\n- Both Max and Zack spin independently on the same spinner.\n- Possible outcomes are {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\n**Check 2: Probability Calculations**\n\n- Probabilities for Max's spins add up to 1.\n- Calculations for equal outcomes are correct.\n- Scenarios where Max's number is smaller are accurately accounted for.\n\n**Check 3: Complementary Probability Calculation**\n\n- The probability that Max's number is larger is correctly derived by subtracting the probability of Max's number being equal or smaller from 1.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything seems in order. The approach is logical, the calculations are consistent, and the final probability value makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{47}{144}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and carefully checking calculations, we've determined that the probability of Max getting a larger number than Zack is \\(\\frac{47}{144}\\). This methodical approach ensures accuracy and builds confidence in the solution.\n\n**Final Note:**\n\nJust like in real problem-solving, it's essential to remain flexible and open to adjusting strategies when the initial approach doesn't seem right. By brainstorming various methods, continuously reflecting, and verifying each step, we can effectively tackle complex probability problems like this one.\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps in understanding how to approach such problems methodically. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore!\n\n---\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's revisit the problem and work through it again, ensuring a thorough and correct approach. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work regularly to avoid any mistakes. Let's dive back in!\n\n---\n\n### **User Query Recap**\n\nMax has a spinner with the following probabilities:\n\n- Lands on 1 with probability \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n- Lands on 2 with probability \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n- Lands on 3 with probability \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n- Lands on 4 with probability \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\)\n\nZack also spins the same spinner. We need to find the probability that Max gets a larger number than Zack does.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflecting on the Initial Approach**\n\nIn my previous attempt, I used the complementary probability method, which seemed logical at first. However, upon reviewing the sample solution provided, I realize that I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities where Max's number is not larger than Zack's. Specifically, I didn't accurately account for all scenarios where Max's number is equal to or smaller than Zack's. \n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis indicates that my initial approach might have oversimplified the problem or missed some critical probability components. To ensure accuracy, I'll reconsider the problem by:\n\n1. **Rechecking Probability Calculations:** Ensuring that all probability scenarios are correctly computed.\n2. **Exploring Alternative Strategies:** Perhaps using a different method like listing all possible outcomes or employing a probability tree.\n3. **Comparing with the Sample Solution:** Aligning my approach with the correct sample solution to identify and correct any errors.\n\n---\n\n### **Rebrainstorming and Exploring Different Strategies**\n\nLet's explore various strategies to solve this problem effectively:\n\n1. **List All Possible Outcomes:**\n   - Create a comprehensive list of all possible outcomes for both Max and Zack.\n   \n2. **Probability Tree Diagram:**\n   - Visualize the probabilities using a tree diagram, capturing all possible combinations.\n\n3. **Direct Probability Calculation:**\n   - Calculate the probabilities directly for each scenario where Max's number is larger.\n\n4. **Revisiting Complementary Probability:**\n   - Use the complementary probability method but ensure all scenarios are accurately accounted for.\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\n\nGiven the sample solution's approach, it seems that the complementary probability method can still work, but I need to ensure that I correctly calculate the probabilities for all scenarios where Max's number is not larger than Zack's.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Defining the Sample Space**\n\nBefore proceeding, let's clearly define the sample space:\n\n- Both Max and Zack spin the same spinner independently.\n- Possible outcomes for both are {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\n**Checking:**\n\nIs there anything missing here? No, this definition captures the essence of the problem.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI'm ready to move forward with this sample space definition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Total Probability Calculation**\n\nTo use the complementary probability method, I need to ensure that the total probability of all possible outcomes sums to 1.\n\n- Max's probabilities:\n  - P(1) = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n  - P(2) = \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n  - P(3) = \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n  - P(4) = \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\)\n\n**Wait...**\n\nLet's verify that these probabilities add up to 1:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{6}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} + \\frac{2}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{12}{12} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe probabilities sum up to 1, confirming their validity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Probability of Max's Number Not Being Larger**\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that Max's number is **not** larger than Zack's, i.e., Max's number is equal to or smaller than Zack's.\n\n**Approach:**\n\nI'll consider all possible scenarios where Max's number is equal to or less than Zack's and calculate the probabilities accordingly.\n\n#### **3.1: Probability Max's Number Equals Zack's Number**\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each possible number where Max's and Zack's numbers are equal:\n\n- **Both Spin 1:**\n  \\[\n  P(1, 1) = P(\\text{Max spins 1}) \\times P(\\text{Zack spins 1}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Both Spin 2:**\n  \\[\n  P(2, 2) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{16}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Both Spin 3:**\n  \\[\n  P(3, 3) = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{36}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Both Spin 4:**\n  \\[\n  P(4, 4) = \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right) = \\frac{1}{144}\n  \\]\n\n**Adding Them Up:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{1}{144}\n\\]\n\n**Common Denominator:**\n\nThe least common multiple of 4, 16, 36, and 144 is 144.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{36}{144}, \\quad \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{9}{144}, \\quad \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{4}{144}, \\quad \\frac{1}{144} = \\frac{1}{144}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{144} + \\frac{9}{144} + \\frac{4}{144} + \\frac{1}{144} = \\frac{50}{144} = \\frac{25}{72}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis probability makes sense.

  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the probability we are looking for and $y$ be the probability that they both spin the same number. By symmetry, it's clear that the probability of Zack getting a larger number than Max does is also equal to $x$. Furthermore, all possible outcomes can be divided into three categories: Max gets a larger number than Zack does, Max and Zack get the same number, or Zack gets a larger number than Max. The sum of the probabilities of these three events is 1, which gives us the equation $x+y+x=1$.\n\nWe can calculate $y$ with a little bit of casework. There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\\dfrac{1}{2}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{4}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\\dfrac{1}{4}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{16}$. The probability of getting a 3 is $\\dfrac{1}{6}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{36}$ and the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{12}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{144}$. This gives us  $$y=\\dfrac{1}{4}+\\dfrac{1}{16}+\\dfrac{1}{36}+\\dfrac{1}{144}=\\dfrac{25}{72}.$$Substituting this into $2x+y=1$ gives us $2x=\\dfrac{47}{72}$, so $x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{47}{144}}$."
