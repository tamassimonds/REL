    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like I would if I were working through it naturally. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their correctness, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's make this as human-like as possible, with all the messy, thinking-out-loud moments included.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n**User Question:**\nHow many ordered pairs of positive integers \\((m,n)\\) satisfy \\(\\gcd(m,n) = 2\\) and \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = 108\\)?\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **GCD and LCM Relationship:** This reminds me of a property I learned where the product of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers equals the product of those two numbers:  \n  \\[\n  \\gcd(m, n) \\times \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m, n] = m \\times n\n  \\]  \n  So, \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 2\\) and \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m, n] = 108\\), which gives:  \n  \\[\n  m \\times n = 2 \\times 108 = 216\n  \\]\n  \n- **Ordered Pairs:** I'm looking for ordered pairs of positive integers, so both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) need to be positive integers.\n\n- **Constraints on \\(m\\) and \\(n\\):** Since \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 2\\), both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) must be multiples of 2. Maybe I can express \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) in terms of another variable?\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Express \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) in terms of their GCD:** Since \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 2\\), let\u2019s set \\(m = 2k\\) and \\(n = 2j\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(j\\) are integers such that \\(\\gcd(k, j) = 1\\).\n\n2. **Factorization Method:** Factor both sides of the equation \\(m \\times n = 216\\) and see how the factors align with the GCD and LCM requirements.\n\n3. **Listing All Ordered Pairs:** Although this seems less efficient, I could list all pairs \\((m, n)\\) that multiply to 216 and check which satisfy both the GCD and LCM conditions.\n\n**Next Step:**\nLet's try the first strategy\u2014expressing \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) in terms of their GCD\u2014and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expressing \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) in Terms of Their GCD**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 2\\), both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) must be even.\n- Let\u2019s write \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) as multiples of 2:\n  \\[\n  m = 2k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = 2j\n  \\]\n- Here, \\(\\gcd(k, j) = 1\\) because the only common factor is 2.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Substitute \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) into the product equation:\n  \\[\n  2k \\times 2j = 216 \\implies 4kj = 216\n  \\]\n  \n- Simplify:\n  \\[\n  kj = \\frac{216}{4} = 54\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, because if \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 2\\), then dividing both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) by 2 should yield coprime integers \\(k\\) and \\(j\\).\n  \n- **Check:** Multiplying \\(k\\) and \\(j\\) should equal 54, which is \\(\\frac{216}{4}\\). This seems correct so far.\n\n**Next Step:**\nNow, I need to find pairs \\((k, j)\\) such that \\(k \\times j = 54\\) and \\(\\gcd(k, j) = 1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Factoring 54 to Find Coprime Pairs**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Need to find all pairs of integers \\((k, j)\\) where \\(k \\times j = 54\\).\n- Additionally, \\(\\gcd(k, j) = 1\\), meaning \\(k\\) and \\(j\\) should be coprime.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Factor 54:**  \n  \\(54 = 2 \\times 3^3\\)\n  \n- **Possible Factor Pairs of 54:**  \n  \\((1, 54), (2, 27), (3, 18), (6, 9)\\)\n  \n- **Checking for Coprimality:**\n  - \\((1, 54)\\): \\(\\gcd(1, 54) = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - \\((2, 27)\\): \\(\\gcd(2, 27) = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - \\((3, 18)\\): \\(\\gcd(3, 18) = 3\\) \u274c\n  - \\((6, 9)\\): \\(\\gcd(6, 9) = 3\\) \u274c\n  \n- **Valid Coprime Pairs:**  \n  \\((1, 54)\\) and \\((2, 27)\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is This Correct?** Yes, only the pairs where the GCD is 1 are valid. \\((3, 18)\\) and \\((6, 9)\\) are not coprime, so they don't satisfy the condition.\n  \n- **Check:** By factoring 54 and ensuring coprimality, I\u2019m confident that the remaining pairs are correct.\n\n**Next Step:**\nNow, let\u2019s list the corresponding \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) for each valid pair \\((k, j)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) from \\(k\\) and \\(j\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- For each valid pair \\((k, j)\\), multiply by 2 to get \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).\n- Since the problem asks for ordered pairs, I'll consider both \\((m, n)\\) and \\((n, m)\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **For \\((k, j) = (1, 54)\\):**\n   - \\(m = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n   - \\(n = 2 \\times 54 = 108\\)\n   \n   Ordered pairs: \\((2, 108)\\) and \\((108, 2)\\)\n\n2. **For \\((k, j) = (2, 27)\\):**\n   - \\(m = 2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n   - \\(n = 2 \\times 27 = 54\\)\n   \n   Ordered pairs: \\((4, 54)\\) and \\((54, 4)\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Match the Problem\u2019s Conditions?** Let\u2019s verify:\n  - **GCD:**  \n    - \\(\\gcd(2, 108) = 2\\),  \n    - \\(\\gcd(4, 54) = 2\\)\n    \n  - **LCM:**  \n    - \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[2, 108] = 108\\),  \n    - \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[4, 54] = 108\\)\n    \n- **Check:** Both conditions \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 2\\) and \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m, n] = 108\\) are satisfied for all four pairs.\n\n**Next Step:**\nLet\u2019s count the valid ordered pairs to answer the question.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Counting the Valid Ordered Pairs**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I\u2019ve identified four valid ordered pairs: \\((2, 108)\\), \\((108, 2)\\), \\((4, 54)\\), and \\((54, 4)\\).\n- Since the problem asks for ordered pairs, each distinct pair should be counted separately.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Total ordered pairs: **4**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is the Count Correct?** Yes, each pair is unique and satisfies both the GCD and LCM conditions.\n  \n- **Check:** I double-checked that all pairs meet the requirements, and there\u2019s no duplication or missing pairs.\n\n**Final Step:**\nBefore finalizing, let me quickly verify if there\u2019s any other possible method I might have missed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Alternative Method:** Perhaps I could have listed all divisors of 216 and checked which pairs satisfy both conditions.\n  \n- **Does That Seem Necessary?** Since the initial method worked well and provided the correct pairs, I don\u2019t think an alternative approach is needed.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Product Verification:**  \n  - All pairs multiply to 216:  \n    \\(2 \\times 108 = 216\\),  \n    \\(4 \\times 54 = 216\\)\n    \n- **GCD and LCM Confirmation:**  \n  - Rechecked that \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 2\\) and \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m, n] = 108\\) for all pairs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Final Answer:** There are **4** ordered pairs of positive integers \\((m, n)\\) that satisfy both \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 2\\) and \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m, n] = 108\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThroughout this problem, I:\n\n1. **Brainstormed Strategies:** Started by considering how GCD and LCM relate and explored different methods to express \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).\n2. **Expressed Variables:** Set \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) in terms of their GCD and simplified the equation.\n3. **Factored and Filtered:** Found all factor pairs of 54 and filtered them to ensure coprimality.\n4. **Calculated Ordered Pairs:** Determined the corresponding \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) for each valid pair and considered the order.\n5. **Verified and Counted:** Checked that all pairs satisfy the conditions and counted them to arrive at the final answer.\n\nBy reflecting at each step and ensuring the correctness of my approach, I arrived confidently at the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = 108 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^3$, we know $m = 2^a \\cdot 3^b$ and $n = 2^c \\cdot 3^d$ for some positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.  Furthermore, $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[2^a \\cdot 3^b, 2^c \\cdot 3^d] = 2^{\\max\\{a,c\\}} \\cdot 3^{\\max\\{b,d\\}}$, so $\\max\\{a,c\\} = 2$ and $\\max\\{b,d\\} = 3$.\n\nAlso, $\\gcd(m,n) = 2$, but $\\gcd(m,n) = \\gcd(2^a \\cdot 3^b, 2^c \\cdot 3^d) = 2^{\\min\\{a,c\\}} \\cdot 3^{\\min\\{b,d\\}}$, so $\\min\\{a,c\\} = 1$ and $\\min\\{b,d\\} = 0$.\n\nThere are only 2 pairs $(a,c)$ that satisfy $\\min\\{a,c\\} = 1$ and $\\max\\{a,c\\} = 2$, namely $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$.

Therefore, there are $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ possible quadruples $(a,b,c,d)$, so there are $\\boxed{4}$ possible pairs $(m,n)$."
