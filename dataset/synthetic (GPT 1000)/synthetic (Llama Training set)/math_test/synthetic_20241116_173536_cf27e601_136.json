    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s tackle this problem step by step. It\u2019s a word problem about a rectangle with a given relationship between length and width, and we need to find the area based on the perimeter. Let's dive into it with brain flow:\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- The problem is about a rectangle, which is familiar territory. I remember that we have formulas for perimeter and area that will definitely help here. The statement about the length being four times the width is critical.\n\n- I could use the relationship between length and width and immediately jump into solving with algebra, but let\u2019s slow down and understand everything properly. First, establish what we know and what we need.\n\n### Brainstorming Potential Approaches\n\n1. **Use Perimeter Formula:** The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \\( P = 2L + 2W \\). We know the perimeter is 100 cm here. This seems promising to start with.\n\n2. **Express Length in Terms of Width:** The problem states that the length \\( L \\) is four times the width \\( W \\) (\\( L = 4W \\)). Substituting this into the perimeter formula seems straightforward.\n\n3. **Find the Width Using Perimeter:** Once we have the equation, solve it to find the width. This gives a good direction because once we know the width, finding the length and subsequently the area should be easy.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Set Up Perimeter Equation:**\n   - Given the perimeter \\( P = 100 \\) cm and \\( L = 4W \\),\n   - Substitute \\( L \\) in the perimeter formula: \\( P = 2L + 2W = 2(4W) + 2W \\).\n\n   Sounds logical so far. Let\u2019s transform this:\n\n2. **Transform the Equation:**\n   - \\( 2(4W) + 2W = 100 \\) simplifies to \\( 8W + 2W = 100 \\).\n   - Combine like terms: \\( 10W = 100 \\).\n\n3. **Solve for Width:**\n   - Divide both sides by 10: \\( W = 10 \\) cm.\n  \n   Aha! We know the width now. Let\u2019s double-check mentally: If \\( 10W = 100 \\), \\( W \\) must be 10. This fits. \n\n4. **Find the Length from Width:**\n   - Use \\( L = 4W \\): Therefore, \\( L = 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\) cm.\n  \n   Length 40 cm seems consistent with calculations. Quick check: If I added these into the perimeter formula, \\( 2 \\times 40 + 2 \\times 10 = 80 + 20 = 100 \\), which checks out. Good.\n\n5. **Calculate Area:**\n   - Area \\( A = L \\times W = 40 \\times 10 = 400 \\) square centimeters.\n\n6. **Reflect:**\n   - The math is simple but required care in setting equations right. Solving shows consistency with problem conditions.\n\n### Checking & Conclusion:\n- Verification with perimeter confirms our dimensionality is correct. Sometimes errors happen in assumptions or small math steps, but every step checks out here.\n- Concluding, the area of the rectangle is 400 square centimeters. Looking over each step confirms a solid resolution.\n\nThat felt quite a flowing and logical walkthrough. Re-checking and thinking through alternative strategies helped reinforce the solution found.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$. We are trying to find the area of the rectangle, or $l \\cdot w$, so we need to first find both $l$ and $w$. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nl &= 4w \\\\\n2l + 2w &= 100 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe will first solve for $w$ by eliminating $l$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $l$, we get $2(4w)+2w=100$ or $w=10$. Plugging this value into the first equation gives $l=4(10)=40$. Thus, the area of the rectangle is $l \\cdot w = 40 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{400}$ square centimeters."
