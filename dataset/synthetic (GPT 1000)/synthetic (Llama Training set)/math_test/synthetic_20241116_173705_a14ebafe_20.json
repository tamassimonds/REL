    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The key here is that we're dealing with an arithmetic sequence, which means that the difference between consecutive terms (the common difference, let\u2019s call it \\(d\\)) is constant. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given terms and their positions.**  \nThe 7th term (\\(a_7\\)) is 30, and the 11th term (\\(a_{11}\\)) is 60. In an arithmetic sequence, terms are expressed as \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\nFirst thoughts:  \nThis seems connected to the formula I\u2019ve studied before. \n\nLet's write down what we have:  \n- \\(a_7 = a_1 + 6d = 30\\)\n- \\(a_{11} = a_1 + 10d = 60\\)\n\nHmm, now we have two equations, two unknowns. That should be solvable. Okay, I\u2019ll focus on isolating the variable \\(d\\).\n\n**Step 2: Solve these equations for \\(d\\).**  \nLet's subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \\(a_1\\):\n\\[\n(a_1 + 10d) - (a_1 + 6d) = 60 - 30 \\\\\n4d = 30 \\\\\nd = \\frac{30}{4} = 7.5\n\\]\n\nAlright, that\u2019s the common difference. Let\u2019s make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Subtracting should have been straightforward.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the solution for \\(d\\) with known terms.**  \nNow, let's just quickly double-check that \\(d = 7.5\\) makes sense. \n\nCalculation:\n- For \\(a_7:\\ a_1 + 6 \\times 7.5 = 30\\)\n- For \\(a_{11}:\\ a_1 + 10 \\times 7.5 = 60\\)\n\nRecheck numbers:  \nThey both line up! Phew, looks like the \\(d\\) value is correct. Now to use it to find the 21st term.\n\n**Step 4: Find the 21st term (\\(a_{21}\\)).**  \nNow, I\u2019ll set up the equation for the 21st term:\n\\[\na_{21} = a_1 + 20d\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(a_1\\), we can use one of our initial equations. I'll use \\(a_7 = a_1 + 6 \\times 7.5 = 30\\):\n\\[\na_1 + 45 = 30 \\\\\na_1 = 30 - 45 = -15\n\\]\n\nOkay, now substitute \\(a_1 = -15\\) and \\(d = 7.5\\) into the equation for \\(a_{21}\\):\n\\[\na_{21} = -15 + 20 \\times 7.5\n\\]\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n\\[\n20 \\times 7.5 = 150 \\\\\na_{21} = -15 + 150 = 135\n\\]\n\nReflecting on it:  \nThis calculation seems solid. The process has been consistent with the arithmetic sequence rules and what I verified earlier. \n\n**Conclusion: The 21st term of this sequence is 135.**   \n\nIf I ponder a bit more, the approach makes sense in a teaching context. Errors were checked step-by-step, and the numbers seem to fall into place nicely. If there\u2019s anything off, it would come from maybe a simplistic arithmetic mistake, but each step was reviewed. It holds up.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the first term in this arithmetic sequence, and let $d$ be the common difference.  Then the $7^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a + 6d = 30$, and the $11^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a + 10d = 60$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $4d = 30$, so $d = 30/4 = 15/2$.\n\nThen the $21^{\\text{st}}$ term is $a + 20d = (a + 10d) + 10d = 60 + 10 \\cdot 15/2 = \\boxed{135}$."
