    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nI'm looking at evaluating the floor function of two numbers here. This looks simple because I'm just dealing with floor operations, which I've done plenty of times before. The floor function, \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor\\), refers to the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\). So for example, \\(\\lfloor 3.2 \\rfloor\\) would be 3. Similarly, \\(\\lfloor -1.5 \\rfloor\\) would be -2. But, wait\u2014handling negatives often trips people up, so I'll need to be a bit careful with the negative value.\n\n**Step-by-Step Plan:**\n1. Evaluate \\(\\lfloor 6.7 \\rfloor\\).\n2. Evaluate \\(\\lfloor -6.7 \\rfloor\\).\n3. Add the results from step 1 and step 2.\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate \\(\\lfloor 6.7 \\rfloor\\)\n- I know that for positive numbers, I just drop the decimal part. So for \\(\\lfloor 6.7 \\rfloor\\), the greatest integer less than or equal to 6.7 is 6.\n- Let's check that: If 6.7 were, say, 6.9, the floor would still be 6. Yes, that seems right.\n\n\\[\n\\lfloor 6.7 \\rfloor = 6\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate \\(\\lfloor -6.7 \\rfloor\\)\n- Negative numbers are a bit trickier. \\(\\lfloor -6.7 \\rfloor\\) is the greatest integer less or equal to -6.7. If I think of a number line, it's to the left but only as far as the first integer\u2014the floor.\n- So, the first integer less than or equal to -6.7 is -7, not -6. Can't forget that it needs to go further left on the number line.\n- Check: If it was something like -6.3, the floor would still be -7, not -6.\n\n\\[\n\\lfloor -6.7 \\rfloor = -7\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Sum the Results\n- Now I'll just add those up: \\(\\lfloor 6.7 \\rfloor + \\lfloor -6.7 \\rfloor\\).\n- It comes out to: \\(6 + (-7)\\).\n\n\\[\n6 + (-7) = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nDoes this make sense? Yeah, the rules for the floor function hold. Testing if I got mixed up with negative direction turned out fine. The positive result decreased by just 1 because the extra decimal amount subtracted a whole additional unit in the negative scenario.\n\nConsidering if there is an easier way? Not that I can think of\u2014floor functions are straightforward tables.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-1}\n\\]",
