    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem:\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- The problem is talking about changing the number of wins, which affects the ratio between losses and wins.\n- The original ratio is given as 3 losses for every 2 wins, which means for every 5 games, they lose 3 and win 2.\n- \"Wins twice as many of its games\" is a bit unclear initially. Does it mean doubling the wins while keeping the losses constant, or does the total number of games change accordingly?\n- Seems similar to proportional reasoning problems I've dealt with before.\n\n**First Approach: Try by Calculation**\n1. **Understanding the Current Situation:**\n   - Assume the team plays a certain number of games where the current ratio applies. Let's say they played 5 games (just a base assumption to make numbers easier).\n   - Losses = 3, Wins = 2.\n\n2. **What happens when wins are doubled?**\n   - If wins are doubled: 2 * 2 = 4 wins.\n   - Total games played remains the same at 5, so initially thought losses should adjust but they can't here if games are still 5.\n   - Wait \u2014 this doesn't account for total games correctly. This can't be right. We need to reconsider the number of total games.\n\n**Second Approach: Use Algebra to Clarify**\n\n3. **Using Algebra:**\n   - Let L represent losses, and W represent wins.\n   - We know L/W = 3/2. Express L in terms of W: L = (3/2)W.\n\n4. **If Wins are doubled:**\n   - New Wins (W') = 2W.\n   - Total original games (G) is L + W. Substituting L with the expression above gives G = (3/2)W + W = (5/2)W.\n\n5. **Recalculating Losses in terms of new wins:**\n   - We need to find new L' such that L' + W' (which takes up the entire original G = (5/2)W) gives remaining losses.\n   - So, G = L' + 2W.\n   - Recall G = (5/2)W from above; solve for L': L' = (5/2)W - 2W = (1/2)W.\n\n6. **New Ratio:**\n   - The new ratio is L'/W' = ((1/2)W) / (2W) = (1/2) / 2 = 1/4.\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n- Does this make sense? We assumed various simplifying factors, but using algebra seems solid. Let me quickly check alternative verification:\n  - For every original series of 5 games (3 losses and 2 wins), double wins become 4 with original number of games consistent through algebra as accounted (5 games made sense given initial assumption).\n\nSo, after considering each approach, the ratio of losses to wins, if they had won twice as many games, is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n**Final Note:**\n- I feel confident about this result. The algebra checks out, especially after considering proportions and examining both total original and derived win conditions systematically using expressed initial ratio constraints.\n- The assumptions in each step were reflected upon and resolved through logical problem-solving, thereby reaching a consistent conclusion.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the number of losses for Kyle's team be $3x$. Thus, the number of wins for Kyle's team is $2x$. If the team had played the same number of games ($5x$) but won twice as many of its games, the team would have won $4x$ games and lost the remaining $5x-4x=x$ games. The ratio of losses to wins would then be $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."
