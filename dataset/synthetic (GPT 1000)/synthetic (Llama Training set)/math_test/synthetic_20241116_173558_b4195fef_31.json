    "working_out": "Alright, let's take a closer look at this problem. We're given a polynomial expression involving terms that each take the form of a fraction with polynomial numerators and denominators. Our goal is to determine the degree of the polynomial \\( p(x) \\).\n\n### First Thoughts\n\n1. **Recognizing the Pattern**: When I first look at this problem, it reminds me of symmetric polynomial expressions or maybe a form of Lagrange interpolation. The fractions make me think there might be some simplification or symmetry hidden in the expression. \n\n2. **Distinct Real Numbers**: The problem mentions that \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\) are distinct real numbers. This likely prevents division by zero in the denominators and ensures uniqueness in some properties of the solution (potentially related to interpolation or basis polynomials).\n\n3. **Polynomial Degree**: Since we're asked for the degree of the polynomial, I'm thinking about how the numerators and denominators will interact and if terms might cancel out.\n\n### Step-by-Step Exploration\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the Structure of Each Term\nEach term in \\( p(x) \\) looks like:\n- \\(\\frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)}\\),\n- \\(\\frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)}\\),\n- \\(\\frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}\\).\n\nEach numerator is a quadratic polynomial, and each denominator is a constant (since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are distinct constants). The degrees of the individual terms' numerators are 2, while the degree of each denominator is 0. As such, each term individually appears to be a quadratic polynomial.\n\n#### Step 2: Polynomial Degree Consideration\nThe degree of each term is determined by the degree of the numerator since the denominator is a nonzero constant. Hence each fraction by itself is a polynomial of degree 2.\n\n#### Step 3: Consider Each Term\u2019s Contribution\nEach term is quadratic, but could it be that these terms somehow cancel each other in such a way the resulting polynomial has a lower degree? This isn't uncommon in symmetric expressions or cases reminiscent of interpolation formulas.\n\n#### Step 4: Check for Cancellations or Reductions\n\n- **Symmetric Cancellation Insight**: This problem is reminiscent of Lagrange basis polynomials, which are known to have properties where specific evaluations simplify them significantly. It prompts me to think about what happens when we evaluate this polynomial at \\( x = a \\), \\( x = b \\), and \\( x = c \\).\n\nEvaluating \\( p(x) \\) at these points could reveal simplifying properties:\n\n1. \\( p(a) = \\frac{(a-b)(a-c)}{(a-b)(a-c)} + 0 + 0 = 1 \\).\n2. \\( p(b) = 0 + \\frac{(b-a)(b-c)}{(b-a)(b-c)} + 0 = 1 \\).\n3. \\( p(c) = 0 + 0 + \\frac{(c-a)(c-b)}{(c-a)(c-b)} = 1 \\).\n\nHence, \\( p(a) = p(b) = p(c) = 1 \\).\n\n#### Step 5: Conclude with Degree Analysis\nBy direct evaluation, \\( p(x) \\) looks like a constant polynomial if it is equal to 1 at these three distinct points. A quadratic cannot degenerate to be a constant when equated at three distinct values (unless it is the constant itself). This strongly hints that \\( p(x) \\) is indeed a constant polynomial equal to 1.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nIn conclusion, because earlier evaluation showed that the polynomial is constant at three distinct points, and since linear or higher degree polynomials cannot be constant at three distinct points unless they are the constant itself, \\( p(x) = 1 \\), which suggests our polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is of degree 0.\n\nThus, the degree of the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Note that $p(x)$ has degree at most 2.  Also, $p(a) = p(b) = p(c) = 1.$  Thus, the polynomials $p(x)$ and 1 agree at three different values, so by the Identity Theorem, they are the same polynomial.  Hence, the degree of $p(x)$ (which is the constant polynomial 1) is $\\boxed{0}.$\n\nYou can check manually that\n\\[p(x) = \\frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \\frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \\frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}\\]simplifies to 1."
