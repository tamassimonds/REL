    "working_out": "First thoughts: Okay, let's begin by understanding what the problem is asking. We have what's called an O'Hara triple, where three integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(x\\) satisfy the condition \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} = x\\). Here, we know \\(b = 9\\) and \\(x = 5\\). We need to find the integer \\(a\\). \n\n1. **Understanding what I know**: \n   - I know that for an O'Hara triple \\( (\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} = x) \\), \\(\\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{a} + 3 = 5\\).\n\n2. **Solving for \\(\\sqrt{a}\\)**:\n   - Rearranging the equation \\( \\sqrt{a} + 3 = 5 \\), I subtract 3 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{a} = 5 - 3 = 2\n     \\]\n\n3. **Finding \\(a\\)**:\n   - I know that \\(\\sqrt{a} = 2\\). To find \\(a\\), I can square both sides:\n     \\[\n     a = 2^2 = 4\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Let's go back and verify this to ensure it's correct. If \\( a = 4 \\), then \\(\\sqrt{4} = 2\\).\n   - Substituting back into the original \\( \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} = x \\):\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{4} + \\sqrt{9} = 2 + 3 = 5\n     \\]\n   - This holds true as it equals \\(x = 5\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Everything seems to check out, so the solution seems correct. Therefore, \\( a = 4 \\).\n\nThrough this process, I stayed organized and broke down each step to ensure clarity. By verifying the calculations and testing them against the condition given, I confidently conclude that the value of \\( a \\) is indeed 4.",
