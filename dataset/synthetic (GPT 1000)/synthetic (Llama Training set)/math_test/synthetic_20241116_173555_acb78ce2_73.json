    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nWe have two inequalities involving integers \\( n \\):\n1. \\( 4n + 3 < 25 \\)\n2. \\( -7n + 5 < 24 \\)\n\nOur task is to find all integers \\( n \\) that satisfy both inequalities.\n\n### Step 2: Consider Strategies\n\nWe can tackle each inequality separately and then find the intersection (overlap) of both solution sets. This seems like a straightforward approach.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the First Inequality\n\n**Inequality 1:** \\( 4n + 3 < 25 \\)\n\n- Start by isolating \\( n \\). To do this, first subtract \\( 3 \\) from both sides:\n  \\[\n  4n + 3 - 3 < 25 - 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4n < 22\n  \\]\n\n- Next, divide both sides by \\( 4 \\) to solve for \\( n \\):\n  \\[\n  n < \\frac{22}{4}\n  \\]\n\n- Simplify \\( \\frac{22}{4} \\) to \\( \\frac{11}{2} \\):\n  \\[\n  n < \\frac{11}{2} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n < 5.5\n  \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, the possible values for \\( n \\) from this inequality are \\( n \\leq 5 \\).\n\n**Quick check:** The approach here seems reasonable. The arithmetic looks correct.\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Second Inequality\n\n**Inequality 2:** \\( -7n + 5 < 24 \\)\n\n- Start by isolating \\( n \\). Subtract \\( 5 \\) from both sides:\n  \\[\n  -7n + 5 - 5 < 24 - 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -7n < 19\n  \\]\n\n- Divide both sides by \\(-7\\) and remember to flip the inequality sign:\n  \\[\n  n > -\\frac{19}{7}\n  \\]\n\n- Simplify \\(-\\frac{19}{7}\\) to approximately \\(-2.71\\):\n  \\[\n  n > -2.71\n  \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, the possible values for \\( n \\) from this inequality are \\( n \\geq -2 \\).\n\n**Quick check:** Flipping the inequality because of dividing by a negative seems correct. The arithmetic checks out.\n\n### Step 5: Find the Intersection\n\nNow we need to find the integers \\( n \\) that satisfy both \\( n \\leq 5 \\) and \\( n \\geq -2 \\). The solution set includes integers from \\(-2\\) to \\(5\\).\n\n### Step 6: Enumerate Possible Values\n\nThe integers satisfying both inequalities are:\n\\[ n = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\]\n\n### Step 7: Conclude and Reflect\n\nThe number of such integers is \\(8\\), corresponding to each of the values listed above. Every step checks out upon reflection, and there's confidence in the correctness of the solution because both individual inequalities have been handled correctly and their intersection identified accurately.\n\nThus, there are \\( \\boxed{8} \\) integers \\( n \\) that satisfy both inequalities.",

  "ground_truth": "Subtract 3 and divide by 4 on both sides of the first inequality to obtain \\begin{align*}\n4n + 3 &< 25 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4n &< 22 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n &< 5.5.\n\\end{align*}Similarly, the second inequality yields \\begin{align*}\n-7n + 5 &< 24 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -7n &< 19 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n &> -\\frac{19}{7}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we are looking for all the integers between $-\\frac{19}{7}$ and $5.5$. Since $-\\frac{19}{7}$ is between $-3$ and $-2$ and the largest integer less than $5.5$ is 5, we need to count the number of integers between $-2$ and $5$, inclusive. There are $5$ positive integers, $2$ negative integers, and zero, so there are $\\boxed{8}$ integers that satisfy both $4n + 3 < 25$ and $-7n + 5 < 24$."
