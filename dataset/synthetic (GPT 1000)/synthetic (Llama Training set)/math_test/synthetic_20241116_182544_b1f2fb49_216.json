    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, following your instructions. I'll start by brainstorming possible strategies and approaches to understand what we need:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- We're given conditions involving remainders when dividing by 4, 3, and 5. This reminds me of problems I've seen using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n- The goal is to find two integers with these properties and then sum them up. These integers need to satisfy three simultaneous congruence relations.\n\n**Breaking Down the Information:**\n\n1. **Divide by 4, remainder 3:** So \\( x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\).\n2. **Divide by 3, remainder 1:** So \\( x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\).\n3. **Divide by 5, remainder 1:** So \\( x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\).\n\nI need to find integers that satisfy all these at once.\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies\n\n- **Direct Calculation:** Go through each number from 1 to 100 and check if they satisfy all conditions. This is brute force and might be cumbersome.\n- **Using Congruences:** Try to combine these congruences using properties and see if I can narrow it down quickly.\n- **Reflection:** I\u2019ve done some modular arithmetic problems before, this situation might benefit from either systematic search or combining congruences efficiently.\n\n### Step 3: Simplification Using Congruences\n\n**Combining Congruences:**\n\n- We need a number \\( x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\) and \\( x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\). If a number gives a remainder of 1 when divided by both 3 and 5, it must also satisfy \\( x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{15} \\). This is a simplification since 15 is the least common multiple of 3 and 5.\n\n- So, now we need to solve:\n  1. \\( x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\)\n  2. \\( x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{15} \\)\n\nThis combination narrows down the possibilites greatly.\n\n### Step 4: Finding Suitable Numbers\n\n**Calculation Through Inspection:**\n\n- Look for numbers \\( x \\) between 1 and 100 that satisfy these conditions:\n\n  - First, calculate a few starting from 1 and check:\n\n    - \\( x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{15} \\): Numbers like 1, 16, 31, 46, 61, 76, 91.\n    - See if any satisfy \\( x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\).\n\n- Check these candidates:\n\n  - 16: \\( 16 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} \\) \u2014 Not a match.\n  - 31: \\( 31 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\) \u2014 Possible candidate.\n  - 46: \\( 46 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} \\) \u2014 Not a match.\n  - 61: \\( 61 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) \u2014 Not a match.\n  - 76: \\( 76 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} \\) \u2014 Not a match.\n  - 91: \\( 91 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\) \u2014 Possible candidate.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Candidates\n\n- **Verification:**\n\n    - For 31:\n        - \\( 31 \\div 4 \\rightarrow \\text{remainder } 3\\)\n        - \\( 31 \\div 3 \\rightarrow \\text{remainder } 1\\)\n        - \\( 31 \\div 5 \\rightarrow \\text{remainder } 1\\)\n        - Matches all conditions!\n\n    - For 91:\n        - \\( 91 \\div 4 \\rightarrow \\text{remainder } 3\\)\n        - \\( 91 \\div 3 \\rightarrow \\text{remainder } 1\\)\n        - \\( 91 \\div 5 \\rightarrow \\text{remainder } 1\\)\n        - Matches all conditions!\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Sum\n\n- With our verified integers: 31 and 91\n- **Sum:** \\( 31 + 91 = 122 \\)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe've found the two integers within the given range that satisfy all the modular conditions, and their sum is 122. This systematic approach by breaking down and combining the congruences seems valid and ends up yielding the correct result.",

  "ground_truth": "Let a common solution be $a$. Then we know \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 3 & \\pmod 4\\\\\na\\equiv 1 & \\pmod 3\\\\\na\\equiv 1 & \\pmod 5\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,5)=1$, $(2)$ and $(3)$ together yield $a\\equiv 1\\pmod {3\\cdot 5}$ which is the same as $a\\equiv 1\\pmod {15}$. Then there exists an integer $n$ such that $a=1+15n$. Substituting this into $(1)$ gives \\[1+15n\\equiv 3\\pmod 4\\implies n\\equiv 2\\pmod 4\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $2$. Then $n\\ge 2\\implies a=1+15n\\ge 31$. $31$ satisfies the original congruences so subtracting it from both sides of each gives \\begin{align*}\na-31\\equiv -28\\equiv 0 & \\pmod 4\\nonumber\\\\\na-31\\equiv -30\\equiv 0 & \\pmod 3\\nonumber\\\\\na-31\\equiv -30\\equiv 0 & \\pmod 5\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $a-31\\equiv 0\\pmod {3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5}$, that is, $a\\equiv 31\\pmod{60}$.\n\nNote that any solution of the above congruence also satisfies the original ones. Then the two solutions are $31$ and $60+31=91$. Thus, $31+91=\\boxed{122}$."
