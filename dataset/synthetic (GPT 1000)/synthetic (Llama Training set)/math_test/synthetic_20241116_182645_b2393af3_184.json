    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem, keeping everything messy and natural as I go through it.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Thought Process\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- \"Hmm, this feels like a straightforward volume problem, but I need to remember that the pool isn't full, just half-full.\"\n- \"What do I know? I'm given dimensions: width, length, and depth, and then there's a little twist with filling.\"\n\n**Strategy Brainstorm:**\n- \"Okay, I think to solve this, I first need the full volume of the pool and then account for only half of it being filled.\"\n- \"I'm thinking of the formula for volume: length \u00d7 width \u00d7 depth. Let's start there.\"\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Full Volume\n\n**Formula Application:**\n- \"The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (basically the shape of our pool) is length \u00d7 width \u00d7 depth.\"\n- \"Let's apply it here with the given dimensions.\"\n\n**Calculation:**\n- \"Full volume = 12 meters (length) \u00d7 6 meters (width) \u00d7 4 meters (depth).\"\n- \"Let's multiply these together:\"\n\n\\[ \n12 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 6 \\, \\text{meters} = 72 \\, \\text{square meters} \n\\]\n\n- \"Then multiply by the depth:\"\n\n\\[ \n72 \\, \\text{square meters} \\times 4 \\, \\text{meters} = 288 \\, \\text{cubic meters} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- \"The full volume of the pool is 288 cubic meters. That seems reasonable, given the dimensions.\"\n\n### Step 3: Account for the Pool Being Half-Full\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- \"Since it's only half full, I need to take half of the full volume.\"\n- \"This means I'll just divide it by 2.\"\n\n**Calculation:**\n- \"Half of 288 cubic meters is:\"\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{288 \\, \\text{cubic meters}}{2} = 144 \\, \\text{cubic meters} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- \"Okay, so the volume of water in the pool is 144 cubic meters when it's half full.\"\n- \"Quick check: This makes sense. We found the full capacity and halved it.\"\n\n### Step 4: Final Check\n\n**Sanity Check:**\n- \"Are these numbers logical?\"\n- \"Dimensions seem realistic for a large pool. Double-checking all the basic math: 12 x 6 x 2 x 2 = 288 divided by 2 gives 144...\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- \"This approach feels solid: We calculated the full volume, adjusted for the half-full condition, and reviewed the math.\"\n- \"I feel confident about 144 cubic meters as the final answer to the volume of water in the half-full pool.\"\n\n### Final Answer\n- The volume of water in the pool when it's half full is 144 cubic meters.\n\nThat was a nice step-by-step breakdown, wasn\u2019t it?",

  "ground_truth": "Since the pool has dimensions $6\\text{ m}$ by $12\\text{ m}$ by $4\\text{ m},$ then its total volume is $6 \\times 12 \\times 4 = 288 \\mbox{ m}^3.$\n\nSince the pool is only half full of water, then the volume of water in the pool is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 288 \\mbox{ m}^3$ or $\\boxed{144 \\mbox{ m}^3}.$"
