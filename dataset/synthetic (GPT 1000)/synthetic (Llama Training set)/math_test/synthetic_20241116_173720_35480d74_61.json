    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this step-by-step:\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, it kind of reminds me of divisibility rules. The number 64 being divisible by its units digit (4) means that 64 divided by 4 is a whole number. So, if I apply this property to numbers between 10 and 50, I need to check per number if it is divisible by its units digit.\n\n**Initial Strategy:**\n\nI could go through each number between 10 and 50, check its units digit, and see if the entire number is divisible by that digit. But that might be a little tedious. Maybe there's a quicker way? \n\nI guess I could look for patterns. Numbers whose units digit is '0' are a special case, since dividing by zero is undefined. So, I\u2019ll exclude them right away. \n\nAlright, let's not overthink and start checking. I\u2019ll reflect again later if this is taking too long.\n\n**Step-by-Step Check:**\n\n1. **Number 10** - Units digit is 0, let's skip because division by zero is not defined.\n\n2. **Number 11** - The units digit is 1. Any number divided by 1 is itself, so 11 qualifies.\n\n3. **Number 12** - The units digit is 2. \\(12 \\div 2 = 6\\) - yes, it divides evenly.\n   \n4. **Number 13** - Units digit is 3. \\(13 \\div 3 \\) is not a whole number - skip.\n\n5. **Number 14** - Units digit is 4. \\(14 \\div 4 \\) is not a whole number - skip.\n\n6. **Number 15** - Units digit is 5. \\(15 \\div 5 = 3\\) - yes, it divides evenly.\n   \n7. **Number 16** - Units digit is 6. \\(16 \\div 6 \\) is not a whole number - skip.\n\nAlright, so far I've got 11, 12, and 15. \n\nI'm starting to feel I'm doing this right because I've actually found numbers that qualify, but let me continue.\n\n8. **Number 17** - Units digit is 7. \\(17 \\div 7 \\) is not a whole number - skip.\n\n9. **Number 18** - Units digit is 8. \\(18 \\div 8 \\) is not a whole number - skip.\n\n10. **Number 19** - Units digit is 9. \\(19 \\div 9 \\) is not a whole number - skip.\n\n11. **Number 20** - Units digit is 0, skip as noted earlier.\n\n12. **Number 21** - Units digit is 1. Any number divided by 1 is itself, so 21 qualifies.\n\n13. **Number 22** - Units digit is 2. \\(22 \\div 2 = 11\\) - yes, it divides evenly.\n    \n14. **Number 23** - Units digit is 3. \\(23 \\div 3 \\) is not a whole number - skip.\n\n15. **Number 24** - Units digit is 4. \\(24 \\div 4 = 6\\) - yes, it divides evenly.\n\n16. **Number 25** - Units digit is 5. \\(25 \\div 5 = 5\\) - yes, it divides evenly.\n    \n17. **Number 26** - Units digit is 6. \\(26 \\div 6 \\) is not a whole number - skip.\n\n18. **Number 27** - Units digit is 7. \\(27 \\div 7 \\) is not a whole number - skip.\n\n19. **Number 28** - Units digit is 8. \\(28 \\div 8 \\) is not a whole number - skip.\n\n20. **Number 29** - Units digit is 9. \\(29 \\div 9 \\) is not a whole number - skip.\n\n21. **Number 30** - Units digit is 0, skip again.\n\n22. **Number 31** - Units digit is 1. Any number divided by 1 is itself, so 31 qualifies.\n\nContinuing the same pattern for the rest of the numbers:\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis process is actually going smoothly enough. I'm picking up a clear pattern with numbers ending in 1, 2, 4, 5 (for obvious reasons with 1 and 5) being places of interest since they tend to be the ones meeting the division criteria. This tells me the exercise isn't going to result in a massive number. \n\nTo briefly double-check my numbers, I identified:\n11, 12, 15, 21, 22, 24, 25, 31, 32, 33.\n\nLet me make sure I don't miss others before concluding:\n\n**Continuing:**\n\n33 - Units digit 3, \\(33 \\div 3 = 11 \\) - yes, it divides evenly.\n\n41, 42, 44, 45 (Yes, after confirming checks are correct)\n\nFinally, Numbers I counted were:  11, 12, 15, 21, 22, 24, 25, 31, 33, 36, 42, 44, 45.\n\n*Different strategies didn't seem necessary as the direct check was quite efficient.*\n\n**Final Aha! Moment:**\n\nA pattern wasn't dominant beyond some obvious units digits, but direct checks were manageable and confirmed without being too arduous. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy counting all these, the answer is that 13 numbers between 10 and 50 have this property of divisibility by their units digit.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's revisit this problem and explore different strategies to find the correct answer.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem:**\n\nOur task is to find how many whole numbers between 10 and 50 have the property that they are divisible by their units digit. Initially, I went through each number sequentially to check this property, but it seems I overlooked some numbers and potential patterns.\n\n**Revisiting Patterns:**\n\nLet's see if we can identify numbers systematically and explore patterns:\n\n1. **Numbers Ending in 1, 2, and 5:**\n   - Any number ending in 1 is divisible by 1.\n   - Numbers ending in 2 will be divisible if the tens digit is even (e.g., 12, 22, 32, 42).\n   - Numbers ending in 5 are divisible (e.g., 15, 25, 35, 45).\n\n2. **Other Digits:**\n   - Numbers ending in 3, 6, and 9 are trickier since they depend on the tens digit. Reassessing earlier numbers:\n     - 33 \u2192 \\(33 \\div 3 = 11\\)\n     - 36 \u2192 \\(36 \\div 6 = 6\\)\n     - 39 \u2192 This was incorrect; it's not a whole number.\n   - Numbers ending in 4 and 8 also require rechecking:\n     - 24 \u2192 \\(24 \\div 4 = 6\\)\n     - 44 \u2192 \\(44 \\div 4 = 11\\)\n     - 48 \u2192 \\(48 \\div 8 = 6\\)\n\n**Reflections and Cross-Verification:**\n\n- Numbers divisible by 1, 2, and 5 made it easier to find qualifying numbers. As noted, other unit digits require careful checking.\n  \n- I missed some numbers in my initial strategy, but upon reevaluation, a clear pattern emerged:\n  - 11, 12, 15, 21, 22, 25, 31, 32, 35, 41, 42, 44, 45\n  - Additionally, I need to include 24, 33, 36, and 48.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI verified the numbers systematically and accounted for overlooked possibilities. Therefore, the correct number of whole numbers between 10 and 50, meeting the property of divisibility by their units digit, is 17.\n\nThanks for the patience while I went through this process! It\u2019s always a learning experience to re-evaluate and ensure thoroughness.",
