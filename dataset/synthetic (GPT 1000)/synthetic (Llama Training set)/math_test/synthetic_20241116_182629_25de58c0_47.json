    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem of factoring \\( 32x^3 - 4x^2 + 20x \\). \n\n**Step 1: Initial Thoughts and Exploration**\n\n- When I first look at this expression, I think of some basic factorization strategies. This expression looks like a polynomial, so common strategies would include factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) or seeing if it can be simplified with other approaches like grouping or special formulas.\n\n- Since all terms include \\( x \\), I initially think about extracting the GCF to simplify the polynomial. \n\n**Step 2: Finding the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**\n\n- Let's identify the GCF of the coefficients: 32, 4, and 20. I know that the GCF of these numbers is 4 because 4 divides all of them evenly.\n\n- Now, let's consider the variable part. The smallest exponent of \\( x \\) here is \\( x \\), which is present in every term. So the GCF in terms of the variable is \\( x \\).\n\n- Hence, the overall GCF of the polynomial \\( 32x^3 - 4x^2 + 20x \\) is \\( 4x \\).\n\n**Step 3: Factoring Out the GCF**\n\n- Let's factor \\( 4x \\) out of each term:\n  \\[\n  32x^3 - 4x^2 + 20x = 4x(8x^2) - 4x(x) + 4x(5)\n  \\]\n\n- This simplifies to:\n  \\[\n  32x^3 - 4x^2 + 20x = 4x(8x^2 - x + 5)\n  \\]\n\n**Step 4: Reflect and Check**\n\n- Let me check to ensure this makes sense. By distributing \\( 4x \\) back, do we return to the original polynomial?\n  - \\( 4x \\times 8x^2 = 32x^3 \\)\n  - \\( 4x \\times (-x) = -4x^2 \\)\n  - \\( 4x \\times 5 = 20x \\)\n\n- That checks out, so the factored form \\( 4x(8x^2 - x + 5) \\) should be correct.\n\n**Step 5: Consider Further Factoring**\n\n- I now ponder whether \\( 8x^2 - x + 5 \\) can be factored further. It seems challenging, as the usual criteria for factoring quadratics (like applying the quadratic formula) don't yield simple factors here.\n\n- Let me briefly apply the discriminant method (from the quadratic formula \\( b^2 - 4ac \\)) to verify. For \\( 8x^2 - x + 5 \\), \\( a = 8 \\), \\( b = -1 \\), and \\( c = 5 \\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Discriminant} = b^2 - 4ac = (-1)^2 - 4 \\times 8 \\times 5 = 1 - 160 = -159\n  \\]\n\n- The negative discriminant indicates no real roots, reaffirming that \\( 8x^2 - x + 5 \\) cannot be factored further over the reals.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\n\n- After exploring the options, I've factored the expression as far as possible for real numbers. The final factorization is:\n  \\[\n  32x^3 - 4x^2 + 20x = 4x(8x^2 - x + 5)\n  \\]\n\nThat seems to wrap it up. I've checked the work, and everything looks solid. If there were any mistakes in the initial brainstorm like suspecting a simpler form, they've been addressed by walking through the solution and confirming the details with some quick reflections.",
