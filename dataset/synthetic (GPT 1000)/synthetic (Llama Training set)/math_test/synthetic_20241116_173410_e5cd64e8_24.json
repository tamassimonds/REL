    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\nAlright, I've got a sum involving an infinite series here. The double summation over \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) with terms depending on \\(i + j + k\\) for \\(k = 1\\) to 7 makes this appear complex. Looks like a combinatorial series or a convolution might appear. Something about telescoping sums or integral transforms might help, but immediate ideas aren't striking.\n\nWait, let's first examine one typical term. It seems like a rational function of the form:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{(i + j + 1)(i + j + 2) \\cdots (i + j + 7)}. \\]\n\nI wonder if there's a simplification or a trick, such as using generating functions or zeta-functions possibly \u2014 reminiscent of problems with multi-indexed summations.\n\nExploring Simplification Strategies:\n\nHmm, could this involve a separation of \\(i\\) and \\(j\\)? Maybe some substitution or a trick exists. What if we attempt recognizing a pattern in one dimension only, say with terms where \\(i + j = k\\)? \n\nOh! This reminds me of when sums transition into symmetric functions or when change of variables aligns them into a single-dimensional sum. For instance, setting \\(n = i + j\\) could simplify it to one series \u2014 that might collapse dimensions, aligning with typical generating function approaches.\n\nChecking with Simpler Cases:\n\nLet\u2019s see how it behaves with smaller limits:\n- Try just a finite sum, say \\(i+j = 0\\) to a few terms, calculating directly.\n- This must test symmetry and dimensional reductions or reveal similar shorter terms.\n\nLet's actually express the sum with \\(n = i + j\\), and convert the problem:\n\nRewriting:\n\nExpressing the double series with a new variable \\(n = i + j\\):\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4)(n+5)(n+6)(n+7)}.\n\\]\n\nEach \\(n\\) has terms \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{n} 1\\).\n\nSimplifying \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{n} 1 = n+1\\) since it just counts the terms.\n\nThus:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{n+1}{(n+1)(n+2)\\cdots(n+7)} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(n+2)(n+3)(n+4)(n+5)(n+6)(n+7)}.\n\\]\n\nThis looks like a problem solvable via series known properties.\n\nDeeper Analysis:\n\nApproaching it as:\n1. Recognize it more systematically as a fraction involving factorials or harmonic numbers.\n2. Transform using some defined series or identities.\n\nHmm...term structure suggests involvement of polygamma functions or integral transforms \u2014 perhaps akin to reciprocal factorial or zetaf\u2014aha! it's reminiscent of an approach I've used in convergence checks using integrals of series or specific functions. Let\u2019s check convergence through integral comparison.\n\nConclusion from Testing / Last Thoughts:\n\nWait! Always useful to apply a residue theorem or use symmetry arguments if possible \u2014 a hidden telecommunication is rare but occurs in rational functions like these. \n\nLastly:\nVerify it with specific convergence tests deploying integrals for comparison:\n\\[\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)\\cdots(x+7)} dx.\n\\]\n\nThoughts flowing any trial into contrast or test reasoning check if needless.\n\nFinal Insight:\n\nPotential integral evaluative means it should tie to known results or hypergeometric combinations further...\n\\[ \\text{evaluate or find error corrections in trials/finite illustrations.} \\]\n\nThe goal is revealing it as a standard evaluated series, likely convergent by factorial dominance \u2014 often a check culminates theoretical intrigue into summation reduction techniques unseen initially. \n\nOh! I should check literature or consolidated formulae if tailored solutions arise not experienced directly now! \n\nReflect: Uncommon problems translate with small trials into graspable outcomes through analytical exercise or representation shifting.",
