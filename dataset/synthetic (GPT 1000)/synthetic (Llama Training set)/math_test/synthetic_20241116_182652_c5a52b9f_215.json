    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, keeping our thoughts organized but allowing for that natural flow as we work towards the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nWhen I first read the problem, my initial thought is that we have two different parametric equations, and somehow, they describe the same curve. That's interesting. Our task is to find the interval \\( I \\) for the parameter \\( s \\).\n\nThe first parameterization involves trigonometric functions, which suggests some sort of circular or periodic nature. The second one looks polynomial, perhaps suggesting something like a transformation or correlation with a quadratic form.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the First Parametric Equation\n\n\\[ (x, y) = (\\sin^2 t, 2 \\cos t) \\]\n\n- **\\( x = \\sin^2 t \\):** This ranges between 0 and 1, since \\( \\sin t \\) varies between -1 and 1.\n- **\\( y = 2 \\cos t \\):** This ranges between -2 and 2, again because \\( \\cos t \\) varies between -1 and 1.\n\nAt this point, part of my brain is wondering if these are describing some kind of circle or ellipse, but let's not jump to conclusions too soon.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Second Parametric Equation\n\n\\[ (x, y) = (-s^2 - 2s, 2s + 2) \\]\n\nThis is a bit more straightforward due to its polynomial nature:\n\n- **\\( x = -s^2 - 2s \\):** This is a downward opening parabola with a vertex at \\( s = -1 \\). It's always negative or zero.\n- **\\( y = 2s + 2 \\):** This is a straight line, increasing linearly with \\( s \\).\n\nThese forms imply something to me: we might need to match these expressions to somehow transform the second equation into one related to trigonometric identities.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Equations\n\nLet's find a relationship between these two parameterizations. The goal is to see how we can transform one to match the behavior of the other, thus identifying the correct interval for \\( s \\).\n\nFor the second parameterization to describe the same curve:\n1. The range of \\( x \\) must match limits seen in the first, i.e., \\( 0 \\leq \\sin^2 t \\leq 1 \\).\n2. The range of \\( y \\) from both must be from -2 to 2, inclusive like in the first.\n\n### Step 5: Attempt a Substitution or Transformation\n\nLet's equate:\n\\[ 2s + 2 = 2 \\cos t \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad s = \\cos t - 1 \\]\nI might try to substitute this back into the second equation\u2019s \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = -(\\cos t - 1)^2 - 2(\\cos t - 1) \\]\n\nLet's see if this gives us a trigonometric identity tying to \\( \\sin^2 t \\).\n\n### Step 6: Expand the Expression\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\\[ x = -(\\cos^2 t - 2\\cos t + 1) - 2\\cos t + 2 \\]\n\\[ x = -\\cos^2 t + 2\\cos t - 1 - 2\\cos t + 2 \\]\n\\[ x = -\\cos^2 t + 1 \\]\n\nNow, use the Pythagorean identity:\n\\[ \\cos^2 t = 1 - \\sin^2 t \\]\n\\[ x = - (1 - \\sin^2 t) + 1 \\]\n\\[ x = \\sin^2 t \\]\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion on Validity and Find Interval\n\nIf the substitution \\( s = \\cos t - 1 \\) allows us to match \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), it works!\n\nRecall:\n- The range for \\( \\cos t \\) is from -1 to 1.\n- As \\( s = \\cos t - 1 \\), then \\( s \\) varies from -2 to 0.\n\nThus, the interval \\( I \\) is \\([-2, 0]\\).\n\n### Step 8: Reflect and Check\n\nLet's quickly check if this leads to the same range:\n- When \\( s = -2 \\), \\( x = -(-2)^2 - 2(-2) = -4 + 4 = 0 \\), matching \\( \\sin^2 t \\) at lowest.\n- When \\( s = 0 \\), \\( x = -0 - 0 = 0 \\), matching \\( \\sin^2 t \\) at 0 at the upper boundary again.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe interval \\( I \\) where \\( s \\) covers the parameterization is: \\([-2, 0]\\). \n\nReflecting on the process, I've connected the trigonometric and polynomial structures effectively by finding the cosine-related transformation on the interval outlined.
