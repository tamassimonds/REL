    "working_out": "Alright, let's get started by diving into the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the problem**\n\nWhen I first read the problem, I notice that we're dealing with some sort of operation on numbers defined with special symbols. Specifically, the problem involves two operations: `&x` and `#x`. At first glance, I wonder how these operations work and in what order they should be applied. The ultimate goal is to find `#(&4)`, so figuring out the meaning of these operations is crucial.\n\n- The operation `&x` is defined as `&x = x + 5`. This means we take a number `x` and add 5 to it.\n- The operation `#x` is defined as `#x = x^2`. This means we take a number `x` and square it.\n\nIt seems straightforward for now, but let's be cautious and ensure the order of operations is followed correctly. \n\n**Step 2: Brainstorming how to approach the problem**\n\nNow that I understand the operations, the next step is to determine the sequence in which they should be applied. We need to find `#(&4)`. \n\nLet's break this down:\n1. First, apply the `&` operation to 4.\n2. Then, apply the `#` operation to the result from step 1.\n\nThis sounds reasonable because `#(&4)` implies we first modify 4 with the `&` operation and then do something more (in this case, squaring) to that result.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the operations step-by-step**\n\nLet's apply each operation according to the order we identified:\n\n1. **Apply `&4`:**  \n   - According to the definition, `&x = x + 5`.  \n   - Substitute `x` with 4: `&4 = 4 + 5 = 9`.  \n   - So, `&4` equals 9.\n\n2. **Apply `#` operation to the result of `&4`:**  \n   - Now, `#x = x^2`.  \n   - We have `x` as 9 from `&4`, so `#9 = 9^2`.  \n   - Calculate `9^2 = 81`.  \n   - Thus, `#(&4)` is `81`.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the solution**\n\nLet's check our work to make sure everything is set right:\n\n- We started by correctly applying `&` to 4, yielding 9, which was executed as `4 + 5`.\n- Then, we took the result and squared it, which involved no missteps in calculation: `9^2 = 81`.\n\nEverything seems consistent with our definitions, so it looks like we've followed the steps correctly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final answer for `#(&4)` is `81`. It seems logical and well-structured based on the problem's framework.\n\nReflecting back on my approach, it confirms the importance of dealing carefully with compounded operations in the order that they are presented. This step-by-step method makes it easier to handle complex questions similar in nature.",
