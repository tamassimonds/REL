    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's dissect the problem statement. We have a rational expression on the left:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x+5}{x^2+x-2}\n\\]\n\nWe need to express this as the sum of two simpler fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A}{x+2} + \\frac{B}{x-1}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we'll need to find another expression after determining \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{x+1} - \\frac{A}{x-2}\n\\]\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nThis looks like a classic partial fraction decomposition problem. The denominator \\(x^2 + x - 2\\) can be factored, which is a key step in partial fractions. My intuition tells me to start with factoring.\n\n### Step 1: Factor the Denominator\n\nThe denominator is \\(x^2 + x - 2\\). Let's factor this:\n\n1. Identify two numbers that multiply to \\(-2\\) and add to \\(1\\).\n2. Those numbers are \\(2\\) and \\(-1\\).\n3. Thus, we can factor the quadratic as:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + x - 2 = (x+2)(x-1)\n   \\]\n\nPerfect, this confirms that the partial fraction decomposition with denominators \\((x+2)\\) and \\((x-1)\\) makes sense.\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Partial Fraction Decomposition\n\nNow, we write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x+5}{(x+2)(x-1)} = \\frac{A}{x+2} + \\frac{B}{x-1}\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the denominators, we'll multiply all terms by \\((x+2)(x-1)\\), resulting in:\n\n\\[\n4x + 5 = A(x-1) + B(x+2)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Expand and Collect Like Terms\n\nLet's expand the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\nA(x-1) + B(x+2) = Ax - A + Bx + 2B = (A+B)x + (2B-A)\n\\]\n\nNow we compare coefficients with the left-hand side:\n\n- Coefficient of \\(x\\): \\(A + B = 4\\)\n- Constant term: \\(2B - A = 5\\)\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\n\nFrom the system of equations:\n\n1. \\(A + B = 4\\)\n2. \\(2B - A = 5\\)\n\nTo solve these, let's substitute:\n\n- From equation 1: \\(A = 4 - B\\)\n- Substitute into equation 2: \\(2B - (4 - B) = 5\\)\n\nSimplify and solve:\n\n\\[\n2B - 4 + B = 5 \\\\\n3B - 4 = 5 \\\\\n3B = 9 \\\\\nB = 3\n\\]\n\nSubstitute back to find \\(A\\):\n\n\\[\nA = 4 - B = 4 - 3 = 1\n\\]\n\n### Verification\n\nIt's always good to verify:\n\n- Check: \\(A + B = 1 + 3 = 4\\) \u2714\n- Check: \\(2B - A = 2(3) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5\\) \u2714\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so \\(A = 1\\) and \\(B = 3\\) are correct.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Required Expression\n\nNow, with \\(A = 1\\) and \\(B = 3\\), find:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{x+1} - \\frac{A}{x-2} = \\frac{3}{x+1} - \\frac{1}{x-2}\n\\]\n\nThis is the simplified expression that comes from substituting values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n### Reflection\n\nFinally, I feel confident about all the steps and calculations. The findings align with my understanding, and all solutions seem correct based on the given equations. Each part of the problem relied on logical principles of algebra and partial fractions. \n\nThat's it! We've methodically gone through from understanding the problem to finding the expression \\(\\frac{B}{x+1} - \\frac{A}{x-2}\\).",

We can solve these equations to get $A=1$ and $B=3$.\nThen\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{B}{x+1} - \\frac{A}{x-2}&=\\frac{3}{x+1} - \\frac{1}{x-2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3(x-2)-1(x+1)}{(x+1)(x-2)}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{2x-7}{(x+1)(x-2)}}.\n\\end{aligned}$$"
