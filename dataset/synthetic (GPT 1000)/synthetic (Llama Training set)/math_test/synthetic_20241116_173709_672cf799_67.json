    "working_out": "First impression: This problem seems to involve some interesting properties of the roots of a polynomial. Root relationships like the one given often suggest some symmetries or special conditions. I've encountered problems involving polynomial roots and symmetric properties before. \n\nLet's brainstorm how we might tackle it:\n\nOne strategy that comes to mind is to use Vieta\u2019s formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Given the nature of this problem, Vieta might be very useful.\n\nAnother approach could be setting up a system of equations to describe the condition where one root is the sum of the other two. Doing this explicitly in terms of the roots might let us extract the value of \\( c \\).\n\nYet another approach could be to directly assume the roots form a convenient pattern due to the problem's symmetry cue. For example, we could try solving the polynomial or transforming it using the given condition and try to balance it around the property.\n\nLet\u2019s start by writing down the properties we know and see which method feels natural.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Vieta\u2019s Formulas\n\nFor the polynomial \\( x^3 + 8x^2 - 4x + c = 0 \\), Vieta\u2019s formulas tell us:\n\n1. The sum of the roots \\( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -8 \\).\n2. The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time \\( r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = -4 \\).\n3. The product of the roots \\( r_1r_2r_3 = -c \\).\n\nWe specifically know that one root is the sum of the other two. Let\u2019s assume this condition applies to, say, \\( r_3 = r_1 + r_2 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Use the condition \\( r_3 = r_1 + r_2 \\)\n\nPlugging \\( r_3 = r_1 + r_2 \\) into Vieta\u2019s first condition:\n\n\\[ r_1 + r_2 + (r_1 + r_2) = -8 \\]\n\\[ 2(r_1 + r_2) = -8 \\]\n\\[ r_1 + r_2 = -4 \\]\n\nThis seems consistent! I\u2019ll pause here to reflect: Seems reasonable because it uses the given condition directly.\n\n### Step 3: Substitute back into Vieta\u2019s Second Formula\n\nNow that we have \\( r_1 + r_2 = -4 \\), let\u2019s substitute this back into the second Vieta\u2019s formula:\n\n\\[ r_1r_2 + r_1(r_1 + r_2) + r_2(r_1 + r_2) = -4 \\]\n\\[ r_1r_2 + r_1(-4) + r_2(-4) = -4 \\]\n\nBut because \\( r_1 + r_2 = -4 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ r_1r_2 - 4(r_1 + r_2) = -4 \\]\n\\[ r_1r_2 - 4(-4) = -4 \\]\n\\[ r_1r_2 + 16 = -4 \\]\n\\[ r_1r_2 = -20 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Use Vieta\u2019s Third Formula\n\nFinally, let\u2019s use the product condition:\n\nGiven that \\( r_3 = -4 = r_1 + r_2 \\), we also have:\n\n\\[ r_1r_2r_3 = -c \\]\n\\[ (-20)(-4) = -c \\]\n\\[ 80 = -c \\]\n\\[ c = -80 \\]\n\n### Final thoughts and checks\n\nI\u2019ll double-check the conditions:\n\n1. \\( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -8 \\) holds because if \\( r_1 + r_2 = -4 \\) and \\( r_3 = -4 \\), then yes, their sum is \\(-8\\).\n2. \\( r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = -4 \\) checks out using substitution calculations.\n3. \\( r_1r_2r_3 = 80 \\) means \\(-c = 80\\), so \\( c = -80 \\).\n\nConclusion: The calculated value of \\( c \\) is consistent with all conditions and checks. \\(\\boxed{-80}\\) is indeed a valid result.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $r$ be the root which is the sum of the other two. Then $2r$ is the sum of all three roots. But by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the equation is $-8,$ so we have $2r = -8,$ or $r = -4.$ Thus, $-4$ is a root of the equation, so setting $x=-4,$ we have \\[(-4)^3 + 8(-4)^2 - 4(-4) + c = 0.\\]Solving for $c$ gives $c = \\boxed{-80}.$"
