    "working_out": "Alright, let's take a look at this problem: Express \\(\\sqrt[12]{8^4}\\) in its simplest form. \n\nAt first glance, this looks like it involves roots and exponents, so I'm thinking about properties of exponents and radicals. \n\n### Step 1: Analyze the expression \n\nFirst thing that comes to mind is that the expression \\(\\sqrt[12]{8^4}\\) can be rewritten using a fractional exponent. Roots can often be expressed as exponents, which helps in simplifying. Specifically, \\(\\sqrt[n]{a^m} = a^{m/n}\\).\n\nApplying this to our expression gives:\n\\[\n\\sqrt[12]{8^4} = 8^{4/12}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the exponent\n\nNow, \\(8^{4/12}\\) can be simplified. Let's simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{4}{12}\\). \n\nHmm, \\(\\frac{4}{12}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) because both 4 and 12 are divisible by 4. So we have:\n\\[\n8^{4/12} = 8^{1/3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Understand \\(8^{1/3}\\)\n\nSeeing \\(8^{1/3}\\), this is actually a cube root of 8. This makes me think: What number, when cubed, gives 8? Oh! 2 cubed is 8. Therefore:\n\\[\n8^{1/3} = 2\n\\]\n\nCheck my reasoning: \n\n- I know \\(2^3 = 8\\), so it makes sense that the cube root of 8 is 2. That confirms my thoughts.\n- My simplification process took me from \\(\\sqrt[12]{8^4}\\), through exponents, to conclude with a neat number: 2\n\n### Step 4: Reflect\n\nAll steps followed logically from one to the next, and I consistently checked my math along the way. Each line makes sense, and I haven\u2019t spotted any mistakes. This method of using fractional exponents and reducing them is effective and led us to a clean result. I\u2019ll consider this complete.\n\nIn conclusion, the simplest form of \\(\\sqrt[12]{8^4}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
