    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this! At first glance, this is an absolute value inequality involving a rational expression. These types of problems often involve breaking down the problem into cases, since the absolute value can be greater than or equal to one in quite a few ways. So, let\u2019s brainstorm possible strategies to tackle this.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n1. **Rational Expression and Absolute Value:** The inequality involves a rational expression and absolute values, which suggests we might need to consider both the numerator and denominator separately, then analyze how they relate to the condition \\(|\\cdot| \\geq 1\\).\n2. **Inequality Cases:** Absolute value inequalities like \\(|f(x)| \\geq 1\\) can be split into two cases:\n   - \\(f(x) \\geq 1\\)\n   - \\(f(x) \\leq -1\\)\n\nThis bifurcation feels like the right way to go since we're dealing with an absolute value. \n\n**Step 1: Break Down the Problem into Cases.**\n\nLet's consider the first case:\n- \\(\\frac{3(x + 1)}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \\geq 1\\)\n\nHmm, for this to be true, the numerator \\(3(x + 1)\\) must be at least as large as the denominator \\(x^2 + 2x + 3\\). Let's set up and simplify this inequality:\n\n\\[ 3(x + 1) \\geq x^2 + 2x + 3 \\]\n\n\\[ 3x + 3 \\geq x^2 + 2x + 3 \\]\n\nAfter subtracting \\(x^2 + 2x + 3\\) from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ 0 \\geq x^2 - x \\]\n\n\\[ 0 \\geq x(x - 1) \\]\n\nThis is essentially solving for the roots of the quadratic and finding where the product is non-positive. The roots are \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 1\\). Testing intervals:\n- \\(x(x-1) \\leq 0\\) is satisfied for \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 1\\).\n\n**Let's consider the second case:**\n- \\(\\frac{3(x + 1)}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \\leq -1\\)\n\nFor this case, we need the opposite sign from what was required in the first case:\n\n\\[ 3(x + 1) \\leq -(x^2 + 2x + 3) \\]\n\n\\[ 3x + 3 \\leq -x^2 - 2x - 3 \\]\n\n\\[ 0 \\leq -x^2 - 5x - 6 \\]\n\nOr simplify further by multiplying through by \\(-1\\) (which flips the inequality):\n\n\\[ x^2 + 5x + 6 \\leq 0 \\]\n\nThe roots of the equation \\(x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\\) are \\(x = -2\\) and \\(x = -3\\). Analyzing sign changes, we find:\n- \\(x^2 + 5x + 6 \\leq 0\\) over the interval \\(-3 \\leq x \\leq -2\\).\n\n**Step 2: Combine the Results.**\n\nThe solution to the original inequality would be the union of solutions from both cases:\n- \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 1\\) from the first case\n- \\(-3 \\leq x \\leq -2\\) from the second case\n\nSo the final solution is:\n\\[ x \\in [-3, -2] \\cup [0, 1] \\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Alright, I need to verify if my reasoning is consistent with both cases considering how the absolute inequality translates into logical conditions.\n\nChecking special cases quickly confirms the rational parts behave as expected around those key intervals. Both solutions match the possible values of the original inequality's relation \\(\\geq 1\\) and \\(\\leq -1\\). Motivation to double-check shows it\u2019s consistent: the intersection of separated intervals retains the integrity of conditions. \n\nGreat, this seems good! I've reflected deeply on whether missed any mathematical pitfalls. This meticulous breakdown really feels solid.",
