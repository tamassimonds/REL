    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about traffic lights step-by-step, like we're brainstorming together. \n\n**First Thoughts:** \n\n- This problem reminds me of basic probability questions I've encountered before. The key here is that we're dealing with time intervals for each light color over a complete cycle.\n- My first step is to figure out the total time of the cycle and compare it to the time intervals for each color, particularly focusing on when the light is not green.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n- We've got a full cycle of 60 seconds. The light is green for 25 seconds, yellow for 5 seconds, and red for 30 seconds.\n- We want the probability that the light is *not* green. This means we'll need to focus on the yellow and red light times since these represent when the light isn't green.\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Calculation with Complement Probability:**\n   - Since the problem asks for when the light is not green, one direct approach is to calculate the complementary probability. \n   - First, determine the probability of it being green and subtract from 1 to find its complement.\n\n2. **Direct Addition of Non-Green Times:**\n   - Another method is to directly calculate the duration when the light is yellow or red and use that as the basis for the probability.\n   - I'll add the yellow and red times to get the total non-green time and then use that value.\n\n**Let's Try the Direct Calculation with Complement:**\n\n- Total cycle = 60 seconds.\n- Green duration = 25 seconds.\n- Probability of the light being green = \\( \\frac{25}{60} \\).\n\nNow let's focus on the probability of it being *not* green:\n\n- Probability of not being green = 1 - Probability of being green.\n- Perform the calculation: \n  - Probability of being green = \\( \\frac{25}{60} \\)\n  - \\( 1 - \\frac{25}{60} = \\frac{60}{60} - \\frac{25}{60} = \\frac{35}{60} \\).\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\n- Simplify \\( \\frac{35}{60} \\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD):\n  - The GCD of 35 and 60 is 5.\n  - So, \\( \\frac{35}{60} = \\frac{35 \\div 5}{60 \\div 5} = \\frac{7}{12} \\).\n\n**Quick Logical Check:**\n\n- Is \\( \\frac{7}{12} \\) correct? Let's quickly recheck:\n  - Non-green time sum = 5 seconds (yellow) + 30 seconds (red) = 35 seconds.\n  - Divide by total cycle time 60 seconds = \\( \\frac{35}{60} \\).\n  - Simplified form = \\( \\frac{7}{12} \\). \n\nEverything checks out with this approach, and I feel confident that it's the correct solution. \n\n**Final Answer:** The probability that the light will not be green is \\( \\frac{7}{12} \\).\n\nReflecting on the process, doing step-by-step checks and exploring complementary probabilities made the problem much easier to handle. This approach aligns with the general principles of probability and ensures we've covered all non-green intervals efficiently.",

  "ground_truth": "The probability that it will be green is $\\frac{25}{60}=\\frac{5}{12}$. So the probability that it is not green is simply $1-\\frac{5}{12}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{12}}$."
