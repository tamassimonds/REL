    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive deep into this problem and unravel it step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nLooking at the equations, the first one is $$(m+n+p)(mn+mp+np) = 25$$ and the second one is $$m^2(n+p) + n^2(m+p) + p^2(m+n) = 4.$$ These equations involve three variables: $m$, $n$, and $p$. \n\nMy initial thought is that these look like symmetric expressions, which sometimes hint at relationships where the individual variable contributions themselves might be useful\u2014like symmetric sums or products.\n\n### Step 2: Considering Strategies\n\n1. **Symmetric Polynomials**: The form of the equations resembles symmetric polynomials. I might need to consider symmetric functions like $m+n+p$, $mn+np+mp$, and $mnp$ (which might be connected since we're asked for the product $mnp$).\n\n2. **Systematic Elimination**: Another option could be to substitute particular values and observe their effects; however, I suspect there might be a more elegant approach involved rather than mere numeric brute force.\n\n3. **Direct Factorization/Simplification**: Attempting to simplify or manipulate one equation and see how it aligns with the other could offer insights.\n\nFor now, I'll try to play with symmetric polynomials to see if they provide an easy pathway.\n\n### Step 3: Simplifying the First Equation\n\nWe start with the first equation: \n$$(m+n+p)(mn+mp+np) = 25.$$\n\nLet's define:\n- $s_1 = m+n+p$,\n- $s_2 = mn+mp+np$,\n- $s_3 = mnp$.\n\nThe equation becomes $s_1 \\cdot s_2 = 25$. \n\n### Step 4: Understanding the Second Equation\n\nThe second equation is:\n$$m^2(n+p) + n^2(m+p) + p^2(m+n) = 4.$$\n\nThis looks quite complex at first glance, so let me explicitly write it out:\n\nThis breaks down further as:\n- $m^2n + m^2p$\n- $n^2m + n^2p$\n- $p^2m + p^2n$\n\nBy factoring within these groups, we get:\n- $m(n+p)m = m^2(n+p)$\n- $n(m+p)n = n^2(m+p)$\n- $p(m+n)p = p^2(m+n)$\n\nRewriting this, observe the symmetry:\n- $mn(m+n) + np(n+p) + pm(p+m)$\n\nNotice how we can probably introduce another substitution or additional simplification formulation here, but at this point, let me solve or examine further.\n\n### Step 5: Reflection and Further Strategy\n\nWait, realizing both equations could correspond to some polynomial root relations. Could considering $a, b, c$ as roots of some polynomial help? Often with such symmetric expressions, Vieta's formulas come into play\u2014I might have missed this angle earlier.\n\n### Step 6: Deeper Insight from Vieta's Formulas\n\nI recall Vieta\u2019s: For roots $m$, $n$, $p$ of a polynomial $x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$, these relationships hold:\n- $A = -(m+n+p)$,\n- $B = mn+np+mp$,\n- $C = -mnp$.\n\nBy trying to recognize the form of $m^2(n+p) + n^2(m+p) + p^2(m+n)$, it often helps to see if re-envisioning within these constraints can make it directly comparable to $A$, $B$, or $C$ calculations:\n\nGiven $s_1 \\cdot s_2 = 25$, knowing this might allow further unraveling and solving for $mnp$ with substitutions arranged after equating it to Vieta\u2019s context.\n\n### Step 7: Making Connections and Wrapping Up\n\nEmploy terms from Vieta to represent what's asked:\n- Rearrange or precisely calculate $mnp$ by obtaining determining factors from $s_1, s_2$ if recognized, substitute values or equivalences to finish strong.\n\nAh, conclusion feels close\u2014I just need to determine constraints for specific $m,n,p$ results while minimizing excessive sums/duplicate versions beyond Vieta.\n\n**Potential Verification:**\n\nRe-run through key points like consistent results, expected transformations, or attempted close substitutions to catch missing alignments or derive simplifications to finalize $mnp$.\n\nFrom all these perspectives, I efficiently reach $mnp = 2$ comfortably, synchronizing observed parameters.\n\nAlright, let's dive back into this problem and carefully navigate through to find the correct solution. Initially, I presumed a certain approach, but let's reexamine and see where I might have gone astray.\n\n### Exploring Alternatives\n\n1. **Reassessing Symmetric Polynomials**: We know the problem includes expressions that look symmetric. Revisiting the path of symmetric polynomials might illuminate a more straightforward route.\n\n2. **Expanding and Aligning**: Perhaps expanding both equations further and directly aligning them side by side will reveal something I missed earlier.\n\n3. **Rethinking Vieta's Formulas Application**: Given we are dealing with symmetric equations, there might be a deeper insight hidden in Vieta's relations.\n\n### Returning to the First Equation\n\nInitially, we have:\n$$(m+n+p)(mn+mp+np) = 25,$$\nexpanding this gave us:\n\\[m^2(n+p) + mn(m+n) + mnp + \\text{symmetric counterparts} = 25.\\]\n\n### Dissecting the Second Equation\n\nThe second equation:\n\\[m^2(n+p) + n^2(m+p) + p^2(m+n) = 4,\\]\nwhen expanded, shares terms with our expanded first equation!\n\n### Aligning Both Equations\n\nOn aligning the terms from both equations, a realization strikes:\n\n\\[\nm^2(n+p) + n^2(m+p) + p^2(m+n) = 4 \\\\\n\\]\nalready contains terms similar to the expansion from the first equation.\n\n#### Utilizing Alignment:\nIf I substitute these terms from the second equation back into the expression extracted from the first equation:\n\n\\[\n25 = 3mnp + [m^2(n+p) + n^2(m+p) + p^2(m+n)] \\\\\n= 3mnp + 4\n\\]\n\n### Solving for mnp\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[25 = 3mnp + 4,\\]\n\nSolving, we find:\n\\[3mnp = 21 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad mnp = 7.\\]\n\n### Reflection and Verification\n\nThis process, compared closely with the initial setup, validates the approach that involved substituting and aligning right from the expanded forms, allowing the direct solving for \\(mnp\\).\n\nAhh, I see where my initial oversight was and appreciate uncovering the right path\u2014it indeed converges to \\(mnp = \\boxed{7}\\). By aligning terms more precisely, the final substitution is clear, and it all fits together beautifully!",
