    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. The task at hand is to find the result of \\(\\frac{25}{4}\\) divided by \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- When I first look at this problem, it reminds me of the rule that dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. Ah yes, this is an important point! So, my initial thought is to try this method. \n\n- Hmm, but before I jump into any calculations, let me reflect on what the quantities involved actually mean. We're trying to find out how many times \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) fits into \\(\\frac{25}{4}\\).\n\n### Strategy Brainstorming\n\n1. **Use the Reciprocal Rule**: As mentioned, divide by a fraction by multiplying by its reciprocal.\n2. **Convert Fractions to Decimals**: Possibly convert both fractions to decimals and perform division. But decimals can get messy, especially when they're not repeating or terminating quickly.\n3. **Visual/Fraction Approach**: Maybe something more visual, like using fraction diagrams? However, dealing with large improper fractions visually might be tricky without drawing paper.\n\n### Let's Try the Reciprocal Rule First\n\n- We know that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) is \\(12\\).\n\n- That means the problem \\(\\frac{25}{4}\\) divided by \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) can be rewritten as \\(\\frac{25}{4} \\times 12\\).\n\n- I'm going to calculate \\(\\frac{25}{4} \\times 12\\) step by step.\n\n### Perform the Multiplication\n\n1. **Multiply the Numerators**:  \n   Multiply 25 by 12.  \n   \\[\n   25 \\times 12 = 300\n   \\]\n\n2. **Keep the Denominator**:  \n   Since we're multiplying by a whole number and we've kept \\(\\frac{25}{4}\\) as is, the denominator remains \\(4\\).\n\n   So, the expression becomes \\(\\frac{300}{4}\\).\n\n### Simplification\n\n- Let's simplify \\(\\frac{300}{4}\\). We'll divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4.\n  \\[\n  \\frac{300}{4} = 75\n  \\]\n\n### Verification\n\n- Quick check: The number \\(\\frac{300}{4}\\) simplifies to 75 correctly, as dividing 300 by 4 gives a whole number that's reasonable.\n\n### Final Reflection\n\n- This approach seems solid, and the answer isn't inconsistent with what I'd expect considering the numbers involved.  \n- No signs of crazy outputs like fractions when I expect wholes, which is good.\n\nSo, the result of dividing \\(\\frac{25}{4}\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) is \\(75\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThrough this thought process, I've confirmed my understanding of dividing fractions by multiplying by the reciprocal. The answer should be clearly marked and double-checked:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{75}\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "Remember that $\\frac{25}{4}$ divided by $\\frac{1}{12}$ is the same as $\\frac{25}{4} \\cdot \\frac{12}{1}$. We can rewrite $\\frac{25}{4} \\cdot \\frac{12}{1}$ as $25 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 12$, which can then be expressed as $25 \\cdot \\frac{12}{4}$. Twelve divided by four is three, so $25 \\cdot \\frac{12}{4}$ is the same thing as $25 \\cdot 3$, which equals $\\boxed{75}.$"
