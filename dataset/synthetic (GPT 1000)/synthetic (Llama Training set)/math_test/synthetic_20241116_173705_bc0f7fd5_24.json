    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're given the expression \\(\\sqrt{5 + \\sqrt{21}} + \\sqrt{5 - \\sqrt{21}}\\), and we're tasked with evaluating it.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- This looks like a classic problem involving radicals. There's an inner radical (\\(\\sqrt{21}\\)) and an outer one.\n- This reminds me of problems where you might need to \"rationalize\" or simplify expressions involving radicals.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies:\n1. **Direct Calculation:** Try calculating the values directly, but this seems overly complex and not neat due to irrational numbers.\n2. **Simplification by Finding Patterns:** Sometimes, expressions of the form \\( \\sqrt{a + b} + \\sqrt{a - b} \\) can simplify neatly. Could the inner radicals cancel each other out in some way?\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Let's consider the possibility of expressing the given expression in a simpler form, perhaps using identities or clever substitutions.\n\n### Plan:\nLet\u2019s try exploring the algebraic manipulation angle, specifically looking at the expression \\( (\\sqrt{5 + \\sqrt{21}} + \\sqrt{5 - \\sqrt{21}})^2 \\). Sometimes squaring such expressions can reveal simplifications.\n\n### Working Through the Steps:\n\n1. **Square the Expression:**\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{5 + \\sqrt{21}} + \\sqrt{5 - \\sqrt{21}})^2 = (5 + \\sqrt{21}) + (5 - \\sqrt{21}) + 2\\sqrt{(5 + \\sqrt{21})(5 - \\sqrt{21})}\n   \\]\n2. **Simplify the Components:**\n   - The sum \\( (5 + \\sqrt{21}) + (5 - \\sqrt{21}) = 5 + 5 = 10 \\).\n   - The product: \n     \\[\n     (5 + \\sqrt{21})(5 - \\sqrt{21}) = 5^2 - (\\sqrt{21})^2 = 25 - 21 = 4.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, \\( 2\\sqrt{4} = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Putting It All Together:**\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{5 + \\sqrt{21}} + \\sqrt{5 - \\sqrt{21}})^2 = 10 + 4 = 14.\n   \\]\n4. **Solve for the Original Expression:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{5 + \\sqrt{21}} + \\sqrt{5 - \\sqrt{21}} = \\sqrt{14}.\n   \\]\n\n### Reflect:\n- The square of the expression turned out to be \\(14\\), which seems reasonable given the operations involved.\n- Using the simplification technique worked quite smoothly. The expression is simplified into something neatly computable. No parts seem overly complicated now.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter stepping through the simplification process, we found that \\(\\sqrt{5 + \\sqrt{21}} + \\sqrt{5 - \\sqrt{21}} = \\sqrt{14}\\). The approach felt right as it utilized a clear algebraic manipulation technique, making the problem approachable and solvable with couple of straightforward steps.",
