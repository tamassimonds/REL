    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem of finding the maximum area of a right triangle inscribed in a circle with a 100-unit diameter. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- This is interesting because the problem involves a right triangle and a circle. Okay, so this reminds me of something called Thales' theorem, which states that if a triangle is inscribed in a semicircle where one side is the diameter, the triangle must be a right triangle. Perfect, that's exactly what we have!\n\n- The question asks for the maximum area of this triangle. So I\u2019m thinking the area of a triangle is typically maximum when it's somehow \u2018balanced\u2019 \u2014 like when it's an isosceles right triangle. But let\u2019s explore that.\n\n### Analyzing the Setup\n\n- Since the diameter of the circle is 100 units, the radius will be half of that, so 50 units. Got it.\n\n- Therefore, the hypotenuse of our inscribed right triangle is the diameter, 100 units. I need to find the values of the other sides (legs) of the triangle such that the area is maximized.\n\n- Given the circle, any right triangle inscribed in it will have its hypotenuse equal to the diameter, i.e., 100 units. \n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Coordinate Geometry Approach:**\n   - Place the circle at the origin with (0,0) having coordinates of (0,0).\n   - Let\u2019s place the diameter parallel to x-axis so points could be (-50, 0) and (50, 0).\n   - Now consider the right triangle's right angle at some point \\((x, y)\\) on the circle \\((x^2 + y^2 = 50^2)\\).\n\n2. **Using Trigonometry:**\n   - Let's assume angle A is at the circle center.\n   - The area of the right triangle can be given as \\( \\frac{1}{2}ab \\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the two legs.\n   - I know that: \\(\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{a}{100}\\) and \\(\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{b}{100}\\).\n   - Therefore, the area can be expressed as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100^2 \\times \\sin(\\theta) \\times \\cos(\\theta) \\).\n\n### Checking if this makes sense:\n\nLet's take a deeper look at \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) because the product \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)\\) reminds me of the identity for sine: \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)\\). \n\n- Substituting this in: Area = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{100^2}{2} \\times \\sin(2\\theta) \\).\n\n- For maximum area, \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\) should be maximized, which occurs at \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 1\\). Therefore, \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\).\n\n- Solving for the maximum area, \\[Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{100^2}{2} \\times 1 = 2500 \\text{ square units}\\].\n\n### Conclusion and Reflection\n\n- This approach feels right. By using the identity \\(\\sin(2\\theta)\\), I\u2019ve shown the area of the triangle can be maximized as an isosceles right triangle, where both legs are equal, and specifically validating that my triangle configuration was optimal.\n\n- Given I was relying on mathematical principles (coordinate geometry and trigonometry identities), and given symmetry and maximums in trigonometric functions, this makes sense logically.\n\nSo, the maximum area of the right triangle inscribed in the circle is **2500 square units**. \n\nWhew, that was quite the journey in ideas and calculations, but it seems to lead naturally to this conclusion!",

  "ground_truth": "Let the triangle be $ABC$, with hypotenuse $\\overline{AB}$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle.   The hypotenuse of a right triangle that is inscribed in a circle is a diameter of the circle, so $\\overline{AB}$ is the diameter of the circle.  Since point $C$ is on the circle, point $C$ is $100/2=50$ units from the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ (which is the center of the circle).  So, point $C$ cannot be any more than 50 units from $\\overline{AB}$.  This maximum can be achieved when $\\overline{OC}\\perp\\overline{AB}$.  The area of $\\triangle ABC$ then is $(50)(100)/2 = \\boxed{2500}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,O;\nA = (-1,0);\nB=-A;\nC = (0,1);\ndraw(A--B--C--A);\ndraw(C--(0,0),dashed);\nO = (0,0);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\n[/asy]"
