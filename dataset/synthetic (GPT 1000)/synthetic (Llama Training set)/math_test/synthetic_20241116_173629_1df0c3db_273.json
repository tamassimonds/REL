    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and take it step by step. \n\n**First Impressions and Strategy Brainstorming:**\n\nLooking at the expression \\(-2x^2 - 20x - 53\\), it seems we're aiming to rewrite it in the form \\(a(x + d)^2 + e\\). This looks like a task involving completing the square. Completing the square is a method used often to rewrite quadratic expressions in a form that looks like \\((x + \\text{some number})^2\\).\n\nI'm thinking: \"Oh! Completing the square usually aligns with changing from standard quadratic form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) to vertex form \\(a(x-h)^2 + k\\). Here, it's given with variables \\(a, d, e\\) but the idea is the same.\"\n\nBut how does this actually work here? The coefficient of \\(x^2\\) isn't \\(1\\), but rather \\(-2\\). Let's see how we can tackle this. Typically, we handle the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) first. Let's plan to do that.\n\n**Step 1: Factoring Out the Coefficient of \\(x^2\\):**\n\nSeeing \\(-2x^2 - 20x - 53\\), our first task might be to factor out the \\(-2\\) from the quadratic terms. This gives me:\n\\[\n-2(x^2 + 10x) - 53\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Completing the Square Inside the Parentheses:**\n\nInside the parentheses, we have \\(x^2 + 10x\\). To complete the square, I remember the trick of taking half of the \\(x\\)-coefficient and squaring it. The coefficient here is \\(10\\).\n\n- Half of \\(10\\) is \\(5\\).\n- Squaring \\(5\\) gives \\(25\\).\n\nHence, \\(x^2 + 10x\\) becomes \\(x^2 + 10x + 25 - 25\\), i.e., \\((x + 5)^2 - 25\\).\n\nThis means, within the expression, we have:\n\\[\nx^2 + 10x = (x+5)^2 - 25\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Substituting Back and Simplifying:**\n\nSubstituting back into the expression:\n\\[\n-2(x^2 + 10x) - 53 = -2((x+5)^2 - 25) - 53\n\\]\n\nDistributing the \\(-2\\):\n\\[\n= -2(x+5)^2 + 50 - 53\n\\]\n\nCombining constants gives:\n\\[\n= -2(x+5)^2 - 3\n\\]\n\nNow, comparing this with \\(a(x+d)^2 + e\\), I notice:\n- \\(a = -2\\)\n- \\(d = 5\\)\n- \\(e = -3\\)\n\n**Final Check and Sum Calculation:**\n\nTo check, I re-evaluate if each concept and transition holds up mathematically. The transformations follow correctly.\n\nNow, I find the desired sum \\(a + d + e\\):\n\\[\n-2 + 5 - 3 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum \\(a + d + e = 0\\).\n\nReflecting on the entire procedure, this approach correctly accounted for all transformations and matches the format expressions were compared against. The methodology makes sense, and my checks appear robust. The solution arrived is consistent with the methodology's steps.",

  "ground_truth": "We will complete the square to rewrite the given expression in standard form. Factoring out a -2 from the first two terms, we have \\[-2(x^2+10x)-53\\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(10/2)^2=25$ inside the parenthesis: \\[-2(x^2+10x+25-25)-53 =-2(x+5)^2 -3 \\]Thus, $a=-2$, $d=5$, and $e=-3$, so the sum $a+d+e$ is $-2+5+(-3)=\\boxed{0}$."
