    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll write down my thoughts and calculations, and correct myself where necessary, just like I would if I were solving this problem on paper. \n\n### Initial Thoughts:\nOkay, looking at the problem, we have three variables, \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\), which are distinct digits from 1 to 9. We're given three equations:\n\n1. \\( A + B = C \\)\n2. \\( AA - B = 2 \\times C \\)\n3. \\( C \\times B = AA + A \\)\n\nAt a glance, this looks like a typical problem where we might try substitutions or direct elimination, but since these are digits, we have limitations on what \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) can be, which might simplify things a bit.\n\n### First Equation:\nThe first equation is relatively simple: \\( A + B = C \\). This implies that \\( C > A \\) and \\( C > B \\). Since \\( C \\) is also a digit, it can range from 1 to 9. Also, since \\( A + B = C \\), the maximum value for \\( C \\) would be 9, which makes sense.\n\n### Second Equation:\nThe second equation \\( AA - B = 2 \\times C \\) where \\( AA \\) represents the two-digit number consisting of two of A. So \\( AA = 10A + A = 11A \\). Thus, we rewrite the equation as:\n\\[ 11A - B = 2C \\]\n\n### Third Equation:\nThe third equation is \\( C \\times B = AA + A \\). Converting \\( AA \\) into digits, we have:\n\\[ C \\times B = 11A + A \\]\n\\[ C \\times B = 12A \\]\n\n### Revisiting the Strategy:\nNow, the equations are:\n1. \\( C = A + B \\)\n2. \\( 11A - B = 2C \\)\n3. \\( C \\times B = 12A \\)\n\nLet's analyze if a substitution can simplify. From 1, we can substitute \\( C = A + B \\) into the other equations. Plugging into 2:\n\\[ 11A - B = 2(A + B) \\]\nExpand and simplify:\n\\[ 11A - B = 2A + 2B \\]\n\\[ 11A - 2A = 2B + B \\]\n\\[ 9A = 3B \\]\n\\[ B = 3A \\]\n\n### Checking Digit Constraints:\nSo \\( B = 3A \\), given \\( B \\) and \\( A \\) are digits from 1 to 9, we need \\( 3A \\leq 9 \\), which implies \\( A \\) must be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nLet's try:\n\n#### Case 1: \\( A = 1 \\)\n- \\( B = 3 \\)\n- \\( C = A + B = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\nChecking this set in the second equation \\( 11A - B = 2C \\):\n- \\( 11(1) - 3 = 2(4) \\)\n- \\( 11 - 3 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 8 = 8 \\), which is true.\n\nChecking the third equation \\( C \\times B = 12A \\):\n- \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12(1) \\)\n- \\( 12 = 12 \\), which is also true.\n\nSo \\( (A, B, C) = (1, 3, 4) \\) satisfies all the equations.\n\n#### Validation:\nFurther check whether these could be other solutions:\n\n-- If \\( A = 2 \\), then \\( B = 6 \\), check:\n- \\( C = A + B = 2 + 6 = 8 \\)\n- Check \\( 11A - B = 2C \\): \\( 22 - 6 = 16\\), \\( 16 = 16\\), valid.\n- Check \\( C \\times B = 12A \\): \\( 8 \\times 6 = 48\\), \\( 48 \\neq 24 \\), not valid.\n\n-- Similarly, for \\( A = 3\\), \\( B = 9\\), check:\n- \\( C = A + B = 3 + 9 = 12\\), out of digit range (1-9), invalid.\n\nTherefore, our only valid solution is for \\( A = 1\\), \\( B = 3\\), and \\( C = 4\\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of the sum \\( A + B + C = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 \\).\n\nContinuously checking my work like this convinces me that no steps were skipped or errors presumed, validating my conclusion with the constraints and logic given.",

  "ground_truth": "We start off by replacing $C$ with $A+B$ and changing the form of the two-digit integer in the second equation. \\begin{align*}\n10A+A-B&=2\\times(A+B)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n11A-B&=2A+2B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n9A&=3B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3A&=B\n\\end{align*}Now we replace $C$, change the two-digit integer, and then substitute $B$ with $3A$ in the third equation. \\begin{align*}\n(A+B)\\times B&=10A+A+A\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=12A\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(A+3A)\\times3A&=12A\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(4A)\\times3A&=12A\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n12(A)^2&=12A\n\\end{align*}For $(A)^2$ to equal $A$, $A$ must equal 1. Since $3A=B$, $B=3$. That means $A+B=C=4$. So the sum of the three digits is $1+3+4=\\boxed{8}$."
