    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\nOkay, we have a vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\), and we are asked to compute the cross product of this vector with itself. My immediate thought is: wait, isn't the cross product of a vector with itself always zero? \n\nHmm, why do I think that? Let me recall the properties of the cross product... Ah yes, right, the cross product of two vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) results in a vector that is perpendicular to both \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\). So, if \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{b}\\), the resulting vector should have no magnitude because there's no perpendicular vector to a vector that points in the same direction as itself.\n\nOh! This means that computing the cross product \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) should yield the zero vector.\n\nLet's double-check my understanding by actually attempting to perform the calculation step-by-step using the standard formula for cross products:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ a_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_2b_3 - a_3b_2 \\\\ a_3b_1 - a_1b_3 \\\\ a_1b_2 - a_2b_1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nFor the vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\), we have:\n- \\(a_1 = b_1 = 4\\)\n- \\(a_2 = b_2 = 5\\)\n- \\(a_3 = b_3 = -1\\)\n\nLet's compute each component:\n\n1. The first component is \\(a_2b_3 - a_3b_2 = 5 \\cdot (-1) - (-1) \\cdot 5 = -5 + 5 = 0\\).\n\n2. The second component is \\(a_3b_1 - a_1b_3 = (-1) \\cdot 4 - 4 \\cdot (-1) = -4 + 4 = 0\\).\n\n3. The third component is \\(a_1b_2 - a_2b_1 = 4 \\cdot 5 - 5 \\cdot 4 = 20 - 20 = 0\\).\n\nPutting it all together, we find:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nGreat, this confirms my initial hunch. The cross product of a vector with itself is indeed the zero vector.\n\nReflecting on this: the analytical approach aligns with the geometric intuition - no vector can be orthogonal to itself when multiplied in this manner.\n\nLet me give it one more quick check: the symmetry in my calculations and the standard property (cross-product of any vector with itself is always zero) reassure me this answer is correct.",
