    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I need to find the value of \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x) = 0\\), given the functional equation:\n\n\\[ f(x) + f(x + 2y) = 6x + 6y - 8. \\]\n\nMy first thought is that since this is a functional equation, maybe there's a way to express \\(f(x)\\) in terms of \\(x\\) directly. But, functional equations can also sometimes be tricky or involve some symmetry or substitution. Let's see.\n\n**Step 1: Try specific values to get insights.**\n\nA natural starting point is to try some specific values for \\(y\\) to make the equation simpler or reveal some pattern.\n\n- **Set \\(y = 0\\):**  \n  \\[\n  f(x) + f(x) = 6x - 8 \\Rightarrow 2f(x) = 6x - 8 \\Rightarrow f(x) = 3x - 4.\n  \\]\n\nWow, that was fast! This simplification directly gave us an expression for \\(f(x)\\). Let me check if this satisfies the original equation for arbitrary \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n**Step 2: Verify the solution \\(f(x) = 3x - 4\\) in the original equation.**\n\nPlug \\( f(x) = 3x - 4 \\) into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x) + f(x + 2y) = (3x - 4) + (3(x + 2y) - 4).\n\\]\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n= 3x - 4 + 3x + 6y - 4 = 6x + 6y - 8.\n\\]\n\nThis matches perfectly with the right-hand side of the given equation, \\(6x + 6y - 8\\). So, \\(f(x) = 3x - 4\\) works for any \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n**Step 3: Find \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x) = 0\\).**\n\nWe need to find when \\(f(x) = 0\\), given \\(f(x) = 3x - 4\\).\n\nSet the function to zero:\n\n\\[\n3x - 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n3x = 4 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{4}{3}.\n\\]\n\nLet me pause here and reflect. This seems too simple; maybe there's something I missed? Hmm, can't think of anything at the moment. Let me do a quick sanity check:\n\n- We derived \\(f(x) = 3x - 4\\) directly from setting \\(y = 0\\).\n- We verified this function against the original equation.\n- Solving for \\(f(x) = 0\\) gave a consistent and straightforward solution.\n\nThat looks correct to me. Nothing seems out of place.\n\nThus, the value of \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x) = 0\\) is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}.\n\\] \n\nIt's always good when the steps flow logically, and all the checks pass smoothly. Glad it worked out!",
