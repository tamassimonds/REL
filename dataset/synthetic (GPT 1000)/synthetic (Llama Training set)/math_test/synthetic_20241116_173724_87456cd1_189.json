  "problem": "I have 7 books I want to arrange on a shelf. Two of them are math books, and one is a physics book. How many ways are there for me to arrange the books if I want to put the math books next to each other, and put both of them to the left of the physics book? (Note that all the books are distinguishable.)",

    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\nWhen I first read this problem, it reminds me of a common arrangement problem in combinatorics where certain items have particular conditions, like needing to stay together or relative positioning. The aspect of books needing to stay together as a \"block\" makes me think of treating those books temporarily as a single unit. This problem combines constraints in both grouping and sequencing, which requires us to approach with care.\n\nInitial Brainstorming:\n1. **Grouping Books**: I can treat the two math books as one single \"block\" to simplify the arrangement problem. This reduces the number of entities we are permuting on the shelf.\n2. **Relative Position**: Additionally, the math book block must be placed to the left of the physics book. This introduces an order constraint.\n3. **Distinguishable Books**: Note that despite grouping the math books, each book is unique, i.e., distinguishable.\n\nApproach:\n1. Count all possible arrangements of the books with the math books grouped together.\n2. Enforce that this group is positioned to the left of the physics book.\n\nLet's check if this approach aligns with the constraints:\n\nStep 1: Treat the Math Books as a Block\n- I will consider the two math books as a single unit or block. This ensures they are next to each other no matter how we arrange the rest.\n- So rather than having 7 distinct books, I have reduced it to 6 entities: [M-block, 5 other books].\n\nStep 2: Arrange the M-block and Physics Book\n- Since they are distinguishable, let\u2019s denote the M-block as \"MB\" and the physics book as \"P\". I need MB to appear before P in the arrangement.\n\nStep 3: Count Total Arrangements:\n- Total different books now: MB (Math Block), P (Physics Book), and the remaining 4 individual books.\n- For the 6 entities, if no order constraint, the total arrangements is 6! (factorial of 6).\n\\[ 6! = 720 \\]\n\nStep 4: Enforce MB Before P\n- Since MB must come before P, we need to consider this constraint.\n- For each arrangement, half the cases will have MB before P and half after (since they are indistinguishable w.r.t. \"order\").\n- Therefore, divide by 2 to correct for only counting the arrangements with MB before P.\n\\[ \\frac{720}{2} = 360 \\]\n\nStep 5: Arrange Within the Math Block\n- The two math books inside the block (MB) can be arranged among themselves.\n- There are 2! ways to arrange the math books within their block, as they are distinguishable.\n\\[ 2! = 2 \\]\n\nStep 6: Final Calculation\n- Multiply the arrangements of the other blocks with the arrangement within MB.\n\\[ 360 \\times 2 = 720 \\]\n\nReflection:\n* Quick Check: The factor of dividing by 2 to account for MB being before P is correct as every permutation has an exact counterpart.\n* Deeper Reflection: By considering the math books as a block and then multiplying permutations by arrangements within that block, didn't miss any scenario. \n\nConclusion:\nThis approach systematically satisfied the problem conditions: \n* Keeping the math books together, \n* Ensuring they appear before the physics book, \n* Accounting for all distinct book permutations, \n* The final number of arrangements that meet all these criteria is, therefore, 720. \u2611\ufe0f\n\nSo, the final answer is 720 ways to arrange these books under the given conditions.",

  "ground_truth": "We can arrange the books on the shelf, pretending that the two math books are actually one book because they must be next to each other. In exactly half of these arrangements, the math books will be to the left of the physics book, giving $6!/2=360$ arrangements. However, in each of these arrangements there are two ways to arrange the math books, so the total number of arrangements is $360\\cdot2=\\boxed{720}$."
