    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We need to rewrite the expression \\( g^4 + 12g^2 + 9 \\) in the form \\( c(g^2 + p)^2 + q \\). Ultimately, we need to find out what \\( q \\) is.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n1. **Similarity to Completing the Square**: The task resembles completing the square, but it's a bit hidden within a polynomial involving a fourth degree term. Completing the square often involves quadratic terms, but here, we want to form something with a squared binomial involving \\( g^2 \\).\n2. **Form Reflection**: The expression given is a quadratic in terms of \\( g^2 \\). Knowing this could hint at some specific approaches that work for quadratics.\n3. **Strategic Start**: Let's work on rewriting the expression in a way that reveals a \\( (g^2 + \\text{something})^2 \\) form.\n\n### Explore Strategies:\n- **Recognize Structure**: The expression looks like a quadratic, \\( (g^2)^2 + 12(g^2) + 9 \\). Here, \\( g^2 \\) acts like a single variable. Maybe if I think of \\( g^2 \\) as a temporary substitution, \\( x = g^2 \\), it may simplify to handling it like \\( x^2 + 12x + 9 \\).\n\n- **Quadratic Set-up**: Once I recognize that, I should think about completing the square or restructuring it graphically. The quadratic strategy could allow reformulation to something square-like.\n\n### Step by Step:\n\n1. **Substitution**: \n   - Substitute \\( x = g^2 \\). The expression becomes \\( x^2 + 12x + 9 \\).\n\n2. **Complete the Square**:\n   - Remember \\( a + b \\Rightarrow (a + \\frac{b}{2})^2 - (\\frac{b}{2})^2 \\).\n   - Apply this technique to \\( x^2 + 12x \\):\n     - Compute the completed square: \\( (x + \\frac{12}{2})^2 - (\\frac{12}{2})^2 \\).\n     - Simplifying gives us \\( (x + 6)^2 - 36 \\).\n3. **Insert Back**:\n   - Substitute back \\( x = g^2 \\) in \\( (x + 6)^2 - 36 \\): \n   - This gives: \\( (g^2 + 6)^2 - 36 \\).\n\n4. **Compare Forms**:\n   - We have \\( (g^2 + 6)^2 - 36 \\).\n   - Match this to the desired form \\( c(g^2 + p)^2 + q \\).\n     - Clearly, \\( c = 1 \\), \\( p = 6 \\), and \\( q = -36 \\).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Quick check: Expanding back should yield the original polynomial \\( g^4 + 12g^2 + 9 \\).\n   - \\( (g^2 + 6)^2 = g^4 + 12g^2 + 36 \\), and subtracting 36 confirms I land back at \\( g^4 + 12g^2 + 9 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n    - \\( q \\) in this scenario is indeed \\( -36 \\).\n\n**Reflection**: The approach worked smoothly by considering \\( g^2 \\) as a substitute within a quadratic structure. The formulating and comparing strategy newly understood and reassured of conversion accuracy. Proceeded without numerically or logically stray errors.\n\nFinally, the value of \\( q \\) in the transformation is \\(-36\\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem and find the correct value of \\( q \\).\n\n### Re-examining the Approach\n\nThe task is to rewrite the expression \\( g^4 + 12g^2 + 9 \\) in the form \\( c(g^2 + p)^2 + q \\), and determine \\( q \\). \n\n#### Original Attempt Recap\n\nPreviously, I attempted to complete the square and found \\( q = -36 \\), but upon reviewing, it seems there has been a mistake. Let's go through this again step by step to pinpoint the error and reach the correct solution.\n\n### New Strategy Exploration\n\n1. **Revisiting Completion of the Square**: \n   - We start with \\( g^4 + 12g^2 + 9 \\). Again, let\u2019s go by substituting \\( x = g^2 \\), which simplifies the expression to \\( x^2 + 12x + 9 \\).\n   \n2. **Complete the Square on \\( x^2 + 12x \\)**:\n   - Recall: \\( a + b \\rightarrow (a + \\frac{b}{2})^2 - (\\frac{b}{2})^2 \\).\n   - Apply to our temporary quadratic: \n     - Compute the completed square for \\( x^2 + 12x \\): \\( (x + 6)^2 - 36 \\).\n\n3. **Adding Back the Constant Term**:\n   - Our expression becomes: \n     \\[\n     (x + 6)^2 - 36 + 9 \n     \\]\n   - Simplifying this yields \\( (x + 6)^2 - 27 \\).\n\n4. **Substitute Back Original Variable**:\n   - Replace \\( x = g^2 \\) to return to the original variable:\n     \\[\n     (g^2 + 6)^2 - 27\n     \\]\n\n5. **Matching the Desired Format**:\n   - Now, we compare it with \\( c(g^2 + p)^2 + q \\):\n     - We find \\( c = 1 \\), \\( p = 6 \\), and indeed \\( q = -27 \\).\n\n6. **Verification and Reflection**:\n   - Expanding \\((g^2 + 6)^2 - 27\\) should yield \\( g^4 + 12g^2 + 9 \\):\n     \\[\n     (g^2 + 6)^2 = g^4 + 12g^2 + 36\n     \\]\n   - Subtract \\( 36 \\) and add \\( 9 \\): \\( g^4 + 12g^2 + 9 \\).\n   - This check confirms both the method and the outcome are correctly aligned now.\n\nThus, upon careful reassessment and substitution, the correct value of \\( q \\) is \\(\\boxed{-27}\\). This reinforces the importance of revisiting calculations to ensure accuracy.",
