    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: finding the largest prime factor of 78. I'll try to unravel this step-by-step while sharing my thoughts out loud.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what exactly is being asked. We're looking for the largest prime factor of the number 78. This means we'll have to break 78 down into its prime factors and identify the biggest one. Okay, that seems straightforward, but let's figure out how we get there.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Thoughts**\n\nMy first instinct is to factor the number by checking divisibility with smaller prime numbers. From experience, if we start from the smallest primes and work upwards, this will help us decompose 78 into smaller and more manageable pieces. So I think I\u2019ll start factoring with the smallest prime, 2, since it's an even number.\n\n**Step 3: Factor by Smallest Prime**\n\n- Check if 78 is divisible by 2: Yes, it is! Because it's an even number.\n  \n  \\[ 78 \\div 2 = 39 \\]\n\nNow, I'm left with 39. I remember that 39 looks like it might be divisible by 3 or 5... maybe even 7? I need to go through these possibilities too.\n\n**Step 4: Factor 39 Further**\n\n- Check if 39 is divisible by 3: Add the digits \\(3 + 9 = 12\\), and 12 is divisible by 3. So, 39 is divisible by 3.\n  \n  \\[ 39 \\div 3 = 13 \\]\n\nThis leaves us with 13. At this stage, I'm mentally recalling the list of small prime numbers. Is 13 a prime number? Hmm... okay, let me quickly recollect.\n\n**Step 5: Is 13 Prime?**\n\nI know that 13 isn\u2019t divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 without having even to calculate this\u2014it's one of the smaller, easily recognizable primes. So yes, 13 is definitely prime. That's a relief because it means I don't need to factor it any further.\n\n**Step 6: Reflection and Verification**\n\nNow, the factors we found are: 2, 3, and 13. Out of these factors, the largest prime factor is 13. \n\n- Quick check back: \n  - 78 divided by 2 is 39.\n  - 39 divided by 3 gives 13, which is prime.\n\nHmm, yes, that all looks correct from beginning to end. Nothing seems awry.\n\n**Final Step: Conclusion**\n\nAfter going through this step-by-step process and checking my work:\n\nThe largest prime factor of 78 is **13**. \n\nThat feels satisfying. I'm confident that I've followed a logical path and arrived at the right answer.",
