    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem step by step and outline our thought process thoroughly.\n\n### Understanding the Question\n\nWe're tasked with evaluating the expression \\( |(4+2i)|\\cdot|(6-3i)| \\). This involves calculating the product of the magnitudes (or moduli) of two complex numbers, \\(4 + 2i\\) and \\(6 - 3i\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- The problem seems to require basic knowledge of complex numbers and their magnitudes.\n- The magnitude of a complex number \\(a + bi\\) is given by \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).\n- We should calculate each magnitude separately and then multiply them.\n\n### Breaking Down the Problem\n\n1. **Calculate the Magnitude of \\(4 + 2i\\):**\n   - Applying the formula for magnitude: \\(|4 + 2i| = \\sqrt{4^2 + 2^2}\\).\n   - Calculating inside the square root: \\(4^2 = 16\\) and \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n   - Summing them: \\(16 + 4 = 20\\).\n   - Taking the square root: \\(\\sqrt{20} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 5} = 2\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Magnitude of \\(6 - 3i\\):**\n   - Applying the same formula: \\(|6 - 3i| = \\sqrt{6^2 + (-3)^2}\\).\n   - Calculating inside the square root: \\(6^2 = 36\\) and \\((-3)^2 = 9\\).\n   - Summing them: \\(36 + 9 = 45\\).\n   - Taking the square root: \\(\\sqrt{45} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 5} = 3\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the Two Magnitudes:**\n   - Product of magnitudes: \\(2\\sqrt{5} \\cdot 3\\sqrt{5}\\).\n   - First multiply the coefficients: \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\).\n   - Now multiply the radicals: \\(\\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{5} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\\).\n   - Combined result: \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\).\n\n### Reflecting and Checking\n\n- Reflecting on each step, everything seems logically correct according to the properties and definitions of complex magnitudes.\n- Quick mental note on the product: The numbers used seem reasonable and consistent with basic arithmetic of radicals.\n\n### Final Verification\n\n- Adding a quick conceptual check: Magnitudes measure distance, and multiplying them aligns with scaling distances in complex plane, which matches our product expectation.\n  \n- Does the solution fit contextually? Yes, calculating and multiplying magnitudes is straightforward and involves expected basic operations.\n\n**Final Answer: 30**\n\nI've walked through the process slowly and checked at each stage to make sure calculations were consistent. Each component aligns with the properties of complex numbers and radicals.",

  "ground_truth": "We know that $|a|\\cdot|b|=|ab|$, so  \\begin{align*}\n|4+2i|\\cdot|6-3i|&=|(4+2i)(6-3i)|\\\\\n&=|2\\cdot3(2+i)(2-i)|\\\\\n&=|2\\cdot3\\cdot5|\\\\\n&=30.\n\\end{align*}Therefore our answer is $\\boxed{30}$."
