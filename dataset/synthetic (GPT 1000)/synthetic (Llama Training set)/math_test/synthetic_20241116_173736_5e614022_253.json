    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and work through it step-by-step.\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Identifying the Problem:**\n   This is a geometry problem involving a regular hexagon and interior perpendiculars. It reminds me of problems involving centroids, symmetry, and area calculations in polygons.\n\n2. **Immediate Observations:**\n   The problem gives us lengths of perpendiculars from an interior point to the six sides of a hexagon. It\u2019s asking for the length of a side of the hexagon. The problem might involve equating areas obtained from these perpendiculars, as that's a common connection.\n\n3. **Reasoning About Symmetry:**\n   A regular hexagon is symmetric, and its properties, such as side lengths and angles, are consistent. This symmetry often simplifies problems.\n\n### **Exploration and Brainstorming:**\n\n4. **Strategy Brainstorming:**\n    - **Consider Areas:** The areas of triangles formed by these perpendiculars might relate to the overall area of the hexagon.\n    - **Leverage Symmetry:** The regularity of the hexagon might introduce simpler calculations.\n    - **Remember Known Results:** There\u2019s a known result involving perpendiculars to sides from an interior point in polygons (Viviani\u2019s theorem), but that primarily applies to equilateral triangles.\n\n5. **Comparing Approaches:**\n    - **Geometry and Symmetry:** Using known properties of hexagons.\n    - **Algebraic Formulation:** Setting equations based on areas.\n    - **Visualizing:** Imagine the hexagon and these perpendiculars.\n\n### **Calculations and Attempts:**\n\n6. **Area Formulation:**\n   The area of the hexagon can be dissected into smaller triangles, and we can use the perpendiculars as heights.\n\n7. **Area of a Single Triangle:**\n   Let\u2019s denote the side length of the hexagon as \\( s \\).\n   - Area of one triangle with base \\( s \\) and height (perpendicular length) `p_i` is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot s \\cdot p_i\\).\n\n8. **Total Area Calculation:**\n   - Use total area from triangles to determine hexagon area.\n   - Hexagon area \\( = \\) Sum of areas of these triangles.\n   - Suppose each \\( p_i \\) corresponds to a perpendicular from that interior point:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot s(4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 9 + 10)\n     \\]\n\n9. **Equating Areas:**\n   For a regular hexagon with side \\( s \\), known formula for area is given by:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\n   \\]\n   Set the expressions equal:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot s \\cdot (4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 9 + 10) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\n   \\]\n\n10. **Simplifying:**\n    \\[\n    s(42) = 3\\sqrt{3}s^2\n    \\]\n\n    Assuming \\( s \\neq 0 \\) (the degenerate case is not possible in this scenario),\n    \\[\n    42 = 3\\sqrt{3}s\n    \\]\n\n11. **Solving for \\( s \\):**\n    \\[\n    s = \\frac{42}{3\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{14}{\\sqrt{3}}\n    \\]\n\n12. **Rationalizing:**\n    - Multiply numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\):\n    \\[\n    s = \\frac{14\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n    \\]\n\n### **Final Check:**\n\n13. **Re-evaluate Each Step:**\n    - Does dividing by non-zero values apply correctly?\n    - Are the area formulations accurate?\n    - Rationalizing step correct?\n    \n14. **Reflection:**\n    Everything seems consistent. The calculations align with geometrical interpretations.  \n\nThus, the side length of the hexagon in simplest radical form is \\( \\frac{14\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\).",
