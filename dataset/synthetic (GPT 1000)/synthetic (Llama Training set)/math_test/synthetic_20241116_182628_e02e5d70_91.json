    "working_out": "First thoughts: Okay, I'm looking at this expression \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\). It looks a lot like problems I've worked on before where I had to rationalize a denominator. That's usually a good way to handle square roots in denominators. The typical approach is to multiply by the conjugate. But wait...the problem is asking for a specific form: \\(A(1+\\sqrt{B})-(\\sqrt{C}+\\sqrt{D})\\). So, let's start with rationalization since it might lead to simplifying the expression.\n\nStep 1: Rationalize the Denominator\n- Strategy: Multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \\(2-\\sqrt{3}\\).\n  \n\\[\n\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{2-\\sqrt{3}}{2-\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nPerform multiplication:\n\nNumerator: \n\\((1+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{3})\\)\n\n- Expand these: \n  \\[\n  1 \\times 2 + 1 \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) + \\sqrt{2} \\times 2 + \\sqrt{2} \\times (-\\sqrt{3})\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  = 2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\n  \\]\n\nDenominator: \n\\((2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3})\\)\n\n- This is a difference of squares:\n  \\[\n  2^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1 \n  \\]\n\nNow the expression becomes:\n\\[\n2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nStep 2: Simplify\nAt this point, I have the fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}}{1}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nStep 3: Check the Form\n- The expression \\(2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\\) looks promising. I need it in the form of \\(A(1+\\sqrt{B})-(\\sqrt{C}+\\sqrt{D})\\).\n\nAfter looking back at the work so far, I realize my goal should be making it fit into the expression given in the problem statement. Let me write the expression in a way that aligns it more closely with the target form.\n\nStep 4: Match to the Target Form\nRe-examine the expression:\n- \\(2 + (2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}) - \\sqrt{3}\\)\n\nNow translating this to that form:\n- \\(A(1+\\sqrt{B})\\): This component could be \\(2\\) plus the radical part.\n\\((2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6})\\) simplifies to a simpler form, \\(\\sqrt{8}\\), but then this seems not to fit directly an \\(A(1+\\sqrt{B})\\) form.\n\nLet me try few arrangements:\n- Recognizing the part \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\) can be reformatted as \\(2(1+\\sqrt{2})\\), and subtracting \\(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6}\\).\n  \nSo, \n\\(2(1+\\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\\)\n\nNow, aligning with the format:\n\\[\nA = 2, \\quad B = 2 \\quad C = 3, \\quad D = 6\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Find the Sum\nThe sum is requested:\n\\[\nA + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13\n\\]\n\nGreat! That makes sense, and it seems everything checks out. My answer for \\(A+B+C+D\\) is 13.",

  "ground_truth": "Multiplying top and bottom by the conjugate, we have $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{3})((2-\\sqrt{3}))} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{3}+2\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{6}}{4-3} = 2-\\sqrt{3}+2\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{6}$. So, we obtain $A=2, B=2, C=3$ and $D=6$ ($C$ and $D$ are interchangeable). So $A+B+C+D = 2+2+3+6 = \\boxed{13}$."
