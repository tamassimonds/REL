  "problem": "Alice wants to buy $3$ pounds of veal at the grocery store, but the scales at the store only show weight in kilograms. If one kilogram is $2.20$ pounds, how many kilograms of veal should Alice buy?  (You may use a calculator on this problem; answer to the nearest hundredth.)",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, it appears to be a straightforward unit conversion issue. But, as with many math problems, it's essential to fully understand what's being asked before jumping to conclusions. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:** \n- Alice wants to purchase 3 pounds of veal, but the weights at the store are in kilograms.\n- We need to convert pounds into kilograms.\n- We're given that 1 kilogram equals 2.20 pounds. This will be our conversion factor.\n  \n**Brainstorming Possible Approaches:**\n1. Use direct conversion from pounds to kilograms.\n2. Explore if there are any patterns or simpler numbers I might recognize.\n3. Double-check the conversion factor; if I'm converting pounds to kilograms, I need to divide, not multiply.\n  \n**Start Calculating:**\n- **Step 1:** Identify the conversion factor. It\u2019s given as 1 kilogram = 2.20 pounds.\n- **Step 2:** Determine how to convert from pounds to kilograms. Since 1 kg = 2.20 pounds, it takes fewer kilograms to equal the same number of pounds.\n- **Step 3:** Set up the formula. To convert pounds to kilograms, we use:   \n  \\[\n  \\text{kilograms} = \\frac{\\text{pounds}}{\\text{conversion factor (pounds per kilogram)}}\n  \\]\n\n- **Step 4:** Plug in the numbers from the problem:\n  \\[\n  \\text{kilograms} = \\frac{3 \\text{ pounds}}{2.20 \\text{ pounds per kilogram}}\n  \\]\n\n- **Step 5:** Perform the division using a calculator:\n  \\[\n  \\text{kilograms} = \\frac{3}{2.20} = 1.3636...\n  \\]\n\n- **Step 6:** Since the problem asks for the answer to the nearest hundredth, round 1.3636 to 1.36.\n\n**Check Our Work:**\n- **Reflection:** Does this result seem reasonable? Yes, because we started with more pounds than kilograms (since pounds per kilogram is greater than 1, we'd expect fewer kilograms than pounds).\n- **Alternative Method Check:** Given that 1 kg = 2.20 pounds, converting from pounds to kilograms must reduce the numerical figure, which supports our rounded answer of 1.36 kg.\n- **Estimation:** Breaking down 3 pounds as slightly more than 1 kg makes practical sense since 2.20 pounds is already 1 kg, and 3 pounds is just slightly more than that.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nAlice should buy approximately **1.36 kilograms** of veal. \n\n**Additional Reflections:**\n- This approach feels correct given the straightforward nature of a conversion problem. There\u2019s no immediate indication of any complexities or exceptions in this case.\n- Always good practice to reflect on whether the magnitude of numbers seems reasonable - fewer kilograms than pounds aligns with our conversion understanding.\n- Next time, I might approach utilizing a conversion ratio directly instead of always diving into calculations, which is useful for building intuition.",
