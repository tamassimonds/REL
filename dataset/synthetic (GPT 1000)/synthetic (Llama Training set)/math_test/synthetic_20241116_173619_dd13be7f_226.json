    "working_out": "Alright, let's delve into this problem step by step. \n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts:  \n- We have two crucial aspects of the cubes - surface area and volume.\n- The cost for each cube is determined by the sum of these two contributions: one proportional to surface area (for the gold paint), and one proportional to volume (for the concrete).\n- We are given the costs for 1-inch and 2-inch cubes and need to determine the cost for a 3-inch cube.\n\nHmm, this looks similar to problems involving fixed and variable costs where you break down components into different parts. \n\n**Step 2: Determine What We Know**\n\n1. The cost of a 1-inch cube is $1.30.\n2. The cost of a 2-inch cube is $6.80.\n\nNow, let's consider the formulas for surface area and volume:\n\n- Surface area of a cube = 6 * side^2\n- Volume of a cube = side^3\n\nFor our specific cases:\n- For a 1-inch cube: Surface Area = 6, Volume = 1\n- For a 2-inch cube: Surface Area = 24, Volume = 8\n\nLet's express the cost in terms of the surface area and volume. Let's denote:\n- \\( c_a \\) = cost per square inch of surface area (cost contribution from the paint)\n- \\( c_v \\) = cost per cubic inch of volume (cost contribution from the concrete)\n\nSo, the cost equation is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = c_a \\times \\text{Surface Area} + c_v \\times \\text{Volume} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Set Up Equations**\n\nBased on the problem, we can write:\n1. \\( 1.30 = c_a \\times 6 + c_v \\times 1 \\)\n2. \\( 6.80 = c_a \\times 24 + c_v \\times 8 \\)\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( c_a \\) and \\( c_v \\)**\n\nOh! This reminds me of solving linear equations with two variables. Let me give it a shot.\n\n- From equation 1: \n  \\[ c_a \\times 6 + c_v = 1.30 \\]\n  \\[ c_v = 1.30 - 6c_a \\] \n\nSubstitute \\( c_v \\) from the first equation into the second one:\n\\[ 6.80 = c_a \\times 24 + 8 \\times (1.30 - 6c_a) \\]\n\\[ 6.80 = 24c_a + 10.4 - 48c_a \\]\n\\[ 6.80 - 10.4 = 24c_a - 48c_a \\]\n\\[ -3.60 = -24c_a \\]\n\\[ c_a = \\frac{3.60}{24} = 0.15 \\]\n\nOkay, seems like \\( c_a = 0.15 \\). I feel pretty good about that since it's a positive and reasonable value considering painting could be cheaper.\n\nSubstitute \\( c_a \\) back to find \\( c_v \\):\n\\[ c_v = 1.30 - 6 \\times 0.15 \\]\n\\[ c_v = 1.30 - 0.90 = 0.40 \\]\n\nGreat! We have \\( c_a = 0.15 \\) and \\( c_v = 0.40 \\).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Cost for a 3-inch Cube**\n\nNow, we can calculate the cost for the 3-inch cube:\n- Surface Area = \\( 6 \\times 3^2 = 54 \\) square inches\n- Volume = \\( 3^3 = 27 \\) cubic inches\n\nUsing our cost formula:\n\\[ \\text{Cost} = c_a \\times \\text{Surface Area} + c_v \\times \\text{Volume} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Cost} = 0.15 \\times 54 + 0.40 \\times 27 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Cost} = 8.1 + 10.8 = 18.9 \\]\n\nWait, let me double-check those calculations... Seems reasonable! \n\n**Step 6: Final Thoughts**\n\nThe cost for a 3-inch cube would therefore be $18.90. Yes, makes sense considering the surface area and volume have both increased, particularly the volume, which heavily contributes to the cost.\n\nThat's it! I feel confident that this is the correct approach and solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the cost per square inch of gold paint, and let $y$ be the cost per cubic inch of concrete.  Since a 1 inch cube has surface area 6 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 1 $\\text{in}^3$ its total price will be $6x+y$ dollars.  Similarly, a 2 inch cube has surface area 24 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 8 $\\text{in}^3$, so its total price will be $24x+8y$ dollars.  We are given that \\begin{align*} 6x+y &=\\$1.30 \\\\ 24x+8y&= \\$6.80 \\end{align*} Subtracting 4 times the first equation from the second gives $4y=\\$1.60$, so $y=\\$0.40$.  Hence $6x=\\$0.90$, so $x=\\$0.15$.  Since a 3 inch cube has surface area 54 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 27 $\\text{in}^3$, its total price will be a total of $54(\\$0.15)+27(\\$0.40)=\\boxed{\\$18.90}$."
