    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: Okay, Newton High School is selling lunches, and I need to figure out if Tyler can afford to buy lunches for himself and his four friends. At first glance, the problem seems simple in terms of multiplication and addition. But wait, there's a catch: we need to figure out the cost of a single lunch first because the question doesn't directly provide the price per lunch. Instead, it mentions the price for three lunches.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Price per Lunch\n\nI see that three lunches cost \\$4.50. So, to find the cost of one lunch, I'll start by dividing the total cost (\\$4.50) by the number of lunches (3).\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost per lunch} = \\frac{\\$4.50}{3} \\]\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost per lunch} = \\frac{4.50}{3} = 1.50 \\]\n\nOkay, one lunch costs \\$1.50. This makes sense; dividing \\$4.50 into three equal parts gives a clear \\$1.50 per lunch.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Total Cost for Tyler and His Friends\n\nNow that I know that each lunch costs \\$1.50, I need to find the total cost for Tyler and his four friends, which makes 5 people in total.\n\nSo, I'm multiplying the number of people by the cost per lunch:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 5 \\times 1.50 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = 5 \\times 1.50 = 7.50 \\]\n\nTyler needs \\$7.50 to buy lunch for himself and his four friends. \n\n### Step 4: Reflecting on the Calculation\n\nLet me quickly check if this makes sense. The logic is straightforward: I divided the total cost for three lunches to find the cost for one, and then multiplied by five for the five lunches. The math is straightforward too. If I were to have rounded incorrectly or done a wrong division or multiplication step, the total could be off, but everything lines up logically. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter working through the steps, Tyler needs \\$7.50 to buy lunches for himself and his four friends. This matches up with the straightforward per-item calculation approach.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThe linear step-by-step breakdown here didn't present too many surprises; it's a fairly standard price multiplication after calculating per unit costs. But it's always good practice to move carefully through each calculation and keep a close eye on the logical flow from beginning to end.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $3$ lunches sell for $\\$4.50$, each lunch sells for $\\frac{\\$4.50}{3}=\\$1.50$.  Thus the total cost of $5$ lunches is $5 \\times \\$1.50=\\boxed{\\$7.50}$."
