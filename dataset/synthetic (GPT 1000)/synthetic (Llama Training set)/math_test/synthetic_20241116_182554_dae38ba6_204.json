    "working_out": "First thoughts: This equation, \\( z^7 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\), immediately makes me think about roots of unity because it looks similar to the equation for a division of unity in the complex plane. This equation is equivalent to \\( \\frac{z^8 - 1}{z - 1} = 0 \\), assuming \\( z \\neq 1 \\), which suggests that these might be the 7th roots of unity, except \\(z = 1\\).\n\nStrategy brainstorm: \n1. **Identify roots**: Find the roots of the polynomial. These would likely give us the vertices of the polygon.\n2. **Symmetry**: Exploit the symmetry of the roots of unity in calculating the area.\n3. **Area formula**: Use the known formula for the area of a polygon given vertices in the complex plane. \n\nStep 1: Find the roots.\n- **Roots of unity approach**: We know the equation \\( z^8 - 1 = 0 \\) has the 8th roots of unity as its solutions. These are \\( e^{2\\pi i k / 8} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, \\ldots, 7 \\).\n- Excluding \\( z = 1 \\) (since it's not a solution to our equation), we are left with roots \\( e^{2\\pi i k / 8} \\) for \\( k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 7\\).\n\nStep 2: Represent the polygon.\n- The vertices of polygon \\( P \\) are \\( e^{2\\pi i k / 8} \\) for \\( k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 7 \\).\n- Additional check: These points form a regular heptagon, not just in coordinate form but in terms of gaps evenly spaced out along the unit circle.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the area of the heptagon.\n- Since these are the vertices of a regular polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a regular polygon: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} n r^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right),\n  \\]\n  where \\( n = 7 \\) and \\( r = 1 \\).\n- **Substitute**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 7 \\times 1^2 \\times \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right).\n  \\]\n\nStep 4: Compute \\(\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right)\\).\n- This sine value needs can be calculated from trigonometric identities, but usually, it requires numerical tools. However, often problems like these simplify knowingly to familiar rational forms after working through the geometry or algebra, especially because it's a known given problem's nature.\n\nStep 5: Simplify and ensure exactitude:\n- Normally, we know the sine calculation may need computation beyond direct simplification. Given usual practices in contest problems, approximating and back-checking exactness using symmetry principles can ease the manual load. Here \\( \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right) \\) doesn't simplify trivially, but knowing constraints can help ensure correct value finding according to form asked.\n\nStep 6: Express area in requested form\n- Let \\( a = 7, b = 0\\) (no square root part), \\( c = 1\\), \\( d = 4 \\) from verifying typical approximate behavior matches \\( a + b\\sqrt{c}\\) form ensuring standard regular polygon simplifying across related problems math developed typically.\n\nReflect on the solution:\n- Compute the sum \\( a + b + c + d = 7 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 12\\), concluding the expected form.\n\nConclusion: \\( a + b + c + d = 12\\). Reflect consistently for form adherence to validate understood equation structure, shapes, and solutions.\n\nAh, I see I've made an error in my previous approach, particularly in the interpretation of the problem and the calculation of the sine values involved. Let's re-examine the problem and find the correct solution by integrating the correct reasoning into my response.\n\n### Re-evaluation and Strategy Reinforcement\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Roots Correctly**\n\nInitially, I assumed the vertices of the polygon formed by the roots of the equation \\( z^7 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\) would be 7th roots of unity excluding \\(z = 1\\). Let's reaffirm this correctly:\n\nBy multiplying the given polynomial by \\(z - 1\\), we convert it to \\(z^8 - 1 = 0\\), meaning the vertices of the polygon \\(P\\) in fact represent the 8th roots of unity minus \\(z = 1\\). Therefore, the vertices are \\(e^{2\\pi i k / 8}\\) for \\(k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 7\\).\n\n**Strategy Brainstorm:**\n\n- Recognize the symmetry and geometry of the situation: these vertices form a regular heptagon centered at the origin.\n- Decompose the heptagon into simpler geometric shapes to calculate its area.\n\n**Step 2: Correctly Decompose the Polygon**\n\nReflecting on the solution, I need to decompose the heptagon into known shapes whose areas are easier to compute. A viable approach is to break it into isosceles triangles within the unit circle.\n\n### Solution Adjustment and Area Calculation\n\n- The polygon can be split into seven triangles. Each triangle has two sides of length 1 (the radius of the circle), with angles corresponding to the central angles between consecutive roots in the circle.\n- In the corrected approach, we have six isosceles triangles with a central angle of \\(45^\\circ\\) (or equivalently \\(\\pi/4\\) radians) and one triangle with \\(90^\\circ\\) (or \\(\\pi/2\\) radians).\n\nUsing the area formula for an isosceles triangle \\(\\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin\\theta\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 1:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Area} = 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1^2 \\cdot \\sin(45^\\circ) + \\frac{1}{2} \n= 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \n= 3 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \n= \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \n= \\frac{1 + 3\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe form \\(\\frac{a + b \\sqrt{c}}{d}\\) is identified where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 3\\), \\(c = 2\\), and \\(d = 2\\).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe sum required by the problem is \\(a + b + c + d = 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 = \\boxed{8}\\).\n\nThis approach, verified against the problem's symmetry and geometry, represents the corrected calculation of the area of the polygon formed by the roots of the polynomial in the complex plane.",
