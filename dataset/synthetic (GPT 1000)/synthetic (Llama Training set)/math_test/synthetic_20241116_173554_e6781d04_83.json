    "working_out": "First thoughts:  \nOkay, let\u2019s think this through. John starts with a certain number of pins, splits them into two equal piles, and gives away some of them. After giving some away, he's left with 66 pins. The problem hints that it's related to fractions, so I might need to use some fraction calculations here. But right away, I'm noticing the complexity of fractions of a fraction\u2014that could be important.\n\n**Understanding the Question:**  \n1. John divides his pins into two equal piles. This means the total number of pins is even.  \n2. He gives his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.  \n3. After giving some to his brother, John has 66 pins left.  \n\nOkay, so combining these bits, I come to see that what I'm really looking for here is John's original number of pins. I need to incorporate the fractions given to figure out how many are given away first.\n\n**Strategy Brainstorming:**  \n- I could start working backwards from the 66 pins John had left.  \n- Another idea would be to express everything in terms of the original number of pins and solve an equation.  \n- There's the possibility of considering simpler numbers first to check my thought process. Sometimes testing with smaller numbers makes it clearer.\n\n**Let me try the equation approach first:**\n\n1. Suppose John originally had \\( x \\) pins.  \n2. After splitting, each pile contains \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) pins.  \n3. John gives his brother: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ of one pile} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{x}{2} = \\frac{x}{12}\n   \\]\n4. This means John is left with all pins minus the amount he gave away:\n   \\[\n   x - \\frac{x}{12} = 66\n   \\]\n\n**Solving the Equation:**  \n\\[ \nx - \\frac{x}{12} = 66 \n\\]\n\\[ \n\\Rightarrow \\frac{12x}{12} - \\frac{x}{12} = \\frac{66 \\times 12}{12} \n\\]\n\\[ \n\\Rightarrow \\frac{11x}{12} = 66 \n\\]\nMultiply both sides by 12 to clear the fraction:\n\\[ \n11x = 66 \\times 12 \n\\]\nCalculate \\( 66 \\times 12 \\):\n- Quick mental calculation\u2014I think \\(66 \\times 12\\) is manageable. \n  - \\(66 \\times (10 + 2) = 660 + 132 = 792\\)\n\nSubstitute back:\n\\[ \n11x = 792 \n\\]\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{792}{11} \n\\]\nNow, divide \\(792\\) by \\(11\\):\n- Double-check \\(792 \\div 11\\), feels larger, but calculating...\n  - 792 can be divided once neatly.\n  - \\(792 \\div 11 = 72 \\) (This seems reasonable).\n\nJohn had 72 pins originally.  \n\n**Verification:**  \nLet's verify to ensure:\n- Divide 72 into two halves: \\(72 / 2 = 36\\).\n- One-third of one pile: \\(36 / 3 = 12\\).\n- Half of that fraction: \\(12 / 2 = 6\\).\n- John originally had \\(72\\), gives away \\(6\\).\n- Left with \\(72 - 6 = 66\\), which is what the problem stated.\n\nThis computation checks out! So, John originally had 72 pins.",

  "ground_truth": "Initially, John has $2a$ pins, where $a$ is the number of pins in each pile. He gives away $\\frac{a}{6}$ pins, so $2a-\\frac{a}{6} = \\frac{11a}{6} = 66$ is the number of pins he has left. We get $a=36$, so he originally had $2a = \\boxed{72}$ pins."
