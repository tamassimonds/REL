    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We're trying to find the remainder when \\(3y^4 - 4y^3 + 5y^2 - 13y + 4\\) is divided by \\(3y - 2\\). To me, this sounds like polynomial long division or perhaps using the Remainder Theorem could work. Let's gather our thoughts and systematically approach it.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Brainstorming\nFirst, I'm considering our options. We've got a polynomial division problem:\n1. **Polynomial long division**: It's straightforward but can get cumbersome for higher-degree polynomials.\n2. **Synthetic division**: I remember this is useful for linear divisors, but only in the form \\(y - c\\), and here we have \\(3y - 2\\).\n3. **Remainder Theorem**: This tells me that for a polynomial \\(f(y)\\), the remainder when divided by \\(y - c\\) is \\(f(c)\\). Hmm, \\(3y - 2\\) could be tricky, but maybe manipulating it can help.\n\nRight now, the Remainder Theorem seems slightly less bulky if we can rework the divisor into a suitable form. But if that fails, polynomial long division might be my backup.\n\n### Step 2: Trying the Remainder Theorem Idea\nThe divisor is \\(3y - 2\\). Let's set it to zero to find \\(y\\):\n\\[ \n3y - 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = \\frac{2}{3}.\n\\]\nThe Remainder Theorem says the remainder of dividing \\(f(y)\\) by \\(y - c\\) is \\(f(c)\\). For \\(3y - 2\\), we substitute \\(y = \\frac{2}{3}\\) into the polynomial:\n\nLet's pause here to check: Do I believe this will work? Yes, because evaluating the polynomial at this specific point should give us the remainder. Let\u2019s calculate:\n\n\\[ \nf\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 3\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 - 4\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 + 5\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 - 13\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) + 4.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Polynomial\nLet's evaluate each term:\n\n1. \\(3\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 = 3 \\cdot \\frac{16}{81} = \\frac{48}{81} = \\frac{16}{27}\\).\n\n2. \\(-4\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = -4 \\cdot \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{-32}{27}\\).\n\n3. \\(5\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = 5 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{20}{9} = \\frac{60}{27}\\).\n\n4. \\(-13\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{26}{3} = -\\frac{234}{27}\\).\n\n5. Constant term: 4 = \\(\\frac{108}{27}\\).\n\nNow add them together: \n\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{27} - \\frac{32}{27} + \\frac{60}{27} - \\frac{234}{27} + \\frac{108}{27}.\n\\]\n\nCombine fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{16 - 32 + 60 - 234 + 108}{27}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-82}{27}\\right).\n\\]\n\nOkay, let me take a step back and check: Does this value seem reasonable? Given our calculations and transformations, I think I'm on the right track.\n\n### Step 4: Reflect\nIs everything accounted for and consistent with what I expect from using the Remainder Theorem? This approach lined up nicely since \\(3y - 2\\) operates with a transformed root. Thus, the remainder of \\(3y^4 - 4y^3 + 5y^2 - 13y + 4\\), when divided by \\(3y - 2\\), is indeed \\(-\\frac{82}{27}\\).\n\nI'm convinced this makes sense and matches our calculations. If any part was confusing, revisiting each polynomials' value swap and arithmetic can help clear up any doubts. Throughout, the use of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) yielded consistent and verified results by direct calculation. Therefore, the remainder is:\n\n**Final Answer: \\(-\\frac{82}{27}\\)**",
