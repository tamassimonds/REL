    "working_out": "Okay, let's break this problem down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Function\nFirst, let's look at the definition of the function \\( f(x) \\):\n\n- **If \\( x < -5 \\):** \\( f(x) = x^2 + 9 \\)\n- **If \\( x \\ge -5 \\):** \\( f(x) = 3x - 8 \\)\n\nOur goal is to find all possible values of \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 10 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Explore Different Strategies\nWe need to consider the two cases separately since the function behaves differently based on the value of \\( x \\). \n\n1. **Case 1: \\( x < -5 \\)**\n2. **Case 2: \\( x \\ge -5 \\)**\n\n### Step 3: Solve Case 1 (\\( x < -5 \\))\nFor \\( x < -5 \\), the function is \\( f(x) = x^2 + 9 \\).\nWe set this equal to 10 and solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ \nx^2 + 9 = 10 \n\\]\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\n\\[ \nx^2 = 1 \n\\]\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ \nx = \\pm 1 \n\\]\n\nHowever, this is where we have to be careful. We need \\( x < -5 \\), and neither \\( x = 1 \\) nor \\( x = -1 \\) satisfies this condition. So there are no solutions from this case.\n\n### Step 4: Solve Case 2 (\\( x \\ge -5 \\))\nFor \\( x \\ge -5 \\), the function is \\( f(x) = 3x - 8 \\).\nWe set this equal to 10 and solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ \n3x - 8 = 10 \n\\]\n\nAdd 8 to both sides:\n\n\\[ \n3x = 18 \n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ \nx = 6 \n\\]\n\nCheck if \\( x = 6 \\) satisfies \\( x \\ge -5 \\). Yes, since \\( 6 \\ge -5 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Check the Solutions\nWe've found potential values of \\( x \\):\n- From Case 1: No valid solutions (\\( x = \\pm 1 \\) both fail the condition \\( x < -5 \\)).\n- From Case 2: \\( x = 6 \\), which is valid because it satisfies \\( x \\ge -5 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nSince the only valid solution comes from Case 2, and it's \\( x = 6 \\), the sum of all possible values of \\( x \\) is simply 6.\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{6}\\). \n\nThroughout the process, we split the problem based on conditions and checked the feasibility of each solution with the given constraints, arriving at a single valid solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We begin by looking at each of the two possible cases; either $x<-5$ and $f(x)=x^2+9=10$, or $x\\ge-5$ and $f(x)=3x-8=10$.\n\nTackling the first case, we find that the only possible values of $x$ that could satisfy $x^2+9=10\\Rightarrow x^2=1$ are 1 and -1, neither of which are less than -5, thus yielding no possible solutions.\n\nIn the second case, the only possible value of $x$ that satisfies $3x-8=10$ is 6. Since this value is greater than or equal to -5, it satisfies both conditions. Thus, the only possible value of $x$ for which $f(x)=10$ is $6$, which means the sum of all possible values is also $\\boxed{6}$."
