    "working_out": "First thoughts: Okay, we're given a quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 6x + 2 = 29\\). My initial instinct is to simplify this equation first. Subtract 29 from both sides to set it to zero, which is a standard step to solve quadratic equations.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Equation\nSubtracting 29 from both sides gives:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 6x + 2 - 29 = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ x^2 - 6x - 27 = 0 \\]\n\nChecking my work here: Yep, that subtraction looks good. Now we have a standard quadratic form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) with \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -6 \\), and \\( c = -27 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Explore Possible Solution Strategies\nHmm, now I could try factoring, using the quadratic formula, or completing the square. Let's brainstorm:\n- **Factoring**: Look for two numbers that multiply to \\(-27\\) and add to \\(-6\\). Hmm. Factors of \\(-27\\) are tough... can't immediately find integers that fit this condition. Let's try another method.\n- **Quadratic Formula**: This seems promising. The quadratic formula is \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Quadratic Formula\nPlugging in \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -6 \\), \\( c = -27 \\):\n\n1. Calculate the discriminant: \n\n   \\[ b^2 - 4ac = (-6)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-27) \\]\n   \\[ = 36 + 108 = 144 \\]\n\n2. Take the square root: \n\n   \\[ \\sqrt{144} = 12 \\]\n\nChecking this: The arithmetic seems solid. Continuing with:\n\n3. Plug these back into the formula:\n\n   \\[ x = \\frac{-(-6) \\pm 12}{2 \\times 1} \\]\n   \\[ x = \\frac{6 \\pm 12}{2} \\]\n\n4. Solve for the roots:\n   - \\( x = \\frac{6 + 12}{2} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\)\n   - \\( x = \\frac{6 - 12}{2} = \\frac{-6}{2} = -3 \\)\n\nOkay, so the solutions are \\( x = 9 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\). This makes sense as I'm solving a quadratic equation that normally has two solutions.\n\n### Step 4: Identify \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nAccording to the problem statement, \\( a \\geq b \\). Thus, \\( a = 9 \\) and \\( b = -3 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Calculate \\( 2a - 3b \\)\nWe're asked for the value of \\( 2a - 3b \\):\n\n\\[ 2a - 3b = 2(9) - 3(-3) \\]\n\\[ = 18 + 9 \\]\n\\[ = 27 \\]\n\n### Check if this Makes Sense\nThe calculations seem consistent with the expected results of the quadratic formula. No arithmetic mistakes jump out.\n\nFinal thoughts: The problem asked us for a derived expression from solutions of a quadratic, and I used the quadratic formula method effectively. Other methods like factoring weren't straightforward due to the specific numbers involved. Rolling with the quadratic formula worked smoothly.\n\nThus, the value of \\( 2a - 3b \\) is \\(\\boxed{27}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Simplifying, we get $x^2-6x-27 = 0$. Now we factor and get $(x - 9)(x + 3) = 0$, hence we have $x=9$ and $x=-3$. Since $a \\geq b$, $a=9$ and $b=-3$, so $2a-3b=2(9)-3(-3)=18+9=\\boxed{27}$."
