    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The given sequence is \\(\\frac{16}{9}, \\frac{8}{3}, 4, 6, 9, \\ldots\\). The problem is asking for the eighth term of this sequence. It's important to figure out what type of sequence this is and how each term is related to the previous one.\n\n**First Impressions:**\n\n- My initial reaction is, \"This looks like it might be a geometric sequence,\" because the problem explicitly mentions a geometric sequence. This means each term is obtained by multiplying the previous one by a constant ratio.\n- I should check if there's a common ratio by dividing each successive term by the previous one.\n\n**Find the Common Ratio:**\n\n1. Calculate the ratio between \\(\\frac{8}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{16}{9}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}}{\\frac{16}{9}} = \\frac{8}{3} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{72}{48} = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n   Okay, the common ratio might be \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n2. Double-check this by finding the ratio of \\(4\\) to \\(\\frac{8}{3}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{\\frac{8}{3}} = 4 \\times \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{12}{8} = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n   Alright, this gives the same ratio, \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\). Feeling more confident now.\n\n3. Verify once more with \\(6\\) to \\(4\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n   Consistent again! It seems \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) is indeed the common ratio of this geometric sequence.\n\n**Now, Use the Formula for the nth Term of a Geometric Sequence:**\n\nThe nth term of a geometric sequence can be found using:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 \\times r^{n-1}\n   \\]\n   where \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(r\\) is the common ratio, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n- \\(a_1 = \\frac{16}{9}\\)\n- \\(r = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n- We need to find the 8th term, \\(a_8\\).\n\n**Calculate the Eighth Term:**\n\n\\[\na_8 = \\frac{16}{9} \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{7}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's work this out step by step:\n- Calculate \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^7\\):\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^7 = \\frac{3^7}{2^7} = \\frac{2187}{128}\n  \\]\n\n- Calculate \\(a_8\\):\n  \\[\n  a_8 = \\frac{16}{9} \\times \\frac{2187}{128}\n  \\]\n\n- Simplify this calculation:\n  \\[\n  a_8 = \\frac{16 \\times 2187}{9 \\times 128}\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's make simplifications if possible:\n- Simplifying, \\(16\\) and \\(128\\) can be reduced:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16}{128} = \\frac{1}{8}\n  \\]\n\n- The expression becomes:\n  \\[\n  a_8 = \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{2187}{9}\n  \\]\n- Simplify \\(\\frac{2187}{9}\\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2187}{9} = 243\n  \\]\n\n- Thus, \\(a_8 = \\frac{243}{8}\\).\n\nPausing briefly here\u2014\"Okay, this calculation seems intricate, but rechecking the arithmetic, everything seems to align correctly.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe eighth term of the sequence is \\(\\frac{243}{8}\\). This looks correct given all the steps and checks. I feel confident in this result.",

  "ground_truth": "The common ratio between consecutive terms is $\\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}$ (we could have chosen any two consecutive terms and divided the second one by the first to find the common ratio; we chose 4 and 6 because they seemed simple). So the $n^\\text{th}$ term of the sequence is $\\frac{16}{9} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^{n-1}$. Plugging in $n=8$, we get $$\n\\frac{16}{9} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^{7} = \\frac{2^4}{3^2} \\cdot \\frac{3^7}{2^7}\n= \\frac{3^5}{2^3}\n= \\boxed{\\frac{243}{8}}.\n$$"
