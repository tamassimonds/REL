    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and try to solve it step-by-step, keeping in mind all the brainstorming processes, checks, and reflections.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nFirst, let's really understand what's being asked. The problem states that the team won \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\) of its games and lost 15 more games than they won. Our task is to determine the total number of games they played in the season.\n\nHmm, right off the bat, this seems to involve some proportion calculations and finding an unknown number of total games. I feel like setting up equations based on given ratios and differences might be a good path forward.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Variables\nLet's assign some variables to make things more concrete:\n- Let \\( W \\) represent the number of games won.\n- Let \\( L \\) represent the number of games lost.\n- Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of games played.\n\nFrom the problem:\n- We know \\( W = \\frac{2}{9}T \\) (since wins are \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\) of total games).\n- Also, we know \\( L = W + 15 \\).\n\nPause... What's our ultimate goal? It's to find \\( T \\). So if we can express \\( T \\) in terms of one variable, we might be able to solve it.\n\n### Step 3: Set Up Equations\nBased on the above:\n1. \\( W = \\frac{2}{9}T \\)\n2. \\( L = W + 15 \\)\n3. Since no games are left unaccounted for, \\( T = W + L \\).\n\nWait a second, let's substitute equation 1 into equation 2:\n\\[ \nL = \\frac{2}{9}T + 15 \n\\]\n\nAnd now express \\( T \\) in terms of \\( W \\) and \\( L \\) from equation 3:\n\\[ \nT = W + L \n\\]\n\nPlugging in what we know:\n\\[ \nT = \\frac{2}{9}T + \\left(\\frac{2}{9}T + 15\\right) \n\\]\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\\[ \nT = \\frac{2}{9}T + \\frac{2}{9}T + 15 \n\\]\n\\[ \nT = \\frac{4}{9}T + 15 \n\\]\n\nCould this be correct? Time for a quick check...\n\n### Step 4: Simplify and Solve\nRearranging to solve for \\( T \\):\n\\[ \nT - \\frac{4}{9}T = 15 \n\\]\nLet's take out \\( T \\) on the left side:\n\\[ \n\\left(1 - \\frac{4}{9}\\right)T = 15 \n\\]\n\nNext:\n\\[ \n\\frac{5}{9}T = 15 \n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( T \\):\n\\[ \nT = \\frac{15 \\times 9}{5} \n\\]\n\\[ \nT = 27 \n\\]\n\nAha! \\( T = 27 \\). This suggests 27 games in total.\n\n### Step 5: Verification\nBefore I celebrate, let\u2019s make sure this fits all conditions:\n- Wins: \\( W = \\frac{2}{9} \\times 27 = 6 \\)\n- Losses: According to the problem, \\( L = W + 15 = 6 + 15 = 21 \\)\n- Total games: \\( W + L = 6 + 21 = 27 \\)\n\nThis all checks out! Every condition from the problem is satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe baseball team played 27 games this season. This path took me through setting up equations based on given conditions, substituting values, and solving for the unknown. Vital checks along the way verified each step was logical and correctly calculated. \n\nReflecting on this, I see that setting initial variables and taking a methodical approach to substituting and simplifying was crucial. Through logical deductions at each stage, even with pauses to reflect and check, led to the right answer. Just like solving a jigsaw puzzle, every piece fell into place by working through each part thoughtfully!",

  "ground_truth": "Suppose we played $x$ games.  Since we won $2/9$ of the games we played, we won $(2/9)x = 2x/9$ games. Therefore, we lost $x - 2x/9 = 7x/9$ games.  Since we lost 15 more games than we won, we have \\[\\frac{7x}{9} - \\frac{2x}{9} = 15.\\]Simplifying the left side gives $5x/9 = 15$, and solving this equation gives $x = \\boxed{27}$ games played."
