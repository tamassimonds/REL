    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with an open mind and a willingness to explore different strategies.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts: I'm looking at an infinite series involving Fibonacci numbers. My task is to evaluate the sum \\(\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{F_{n + 1}}{F_n F_{n + 2}}\\). Fibonacci numbers are defined recursively, with \\( F_0 = 0 \\), \\( F_1 = 1 \\), and each subsequent number as the sum of the two preceding ones, i.e., \\( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\nOne possible approach could be looking for a telescoping series. That's a common strategy with sums involving Fibonacci numbers or rational functions. A series telescopes if most terms cancel out, leaving only a few terms that sum up to the final result.\n\nAnother approach is to use identities related to Fibonacci numbers. There's quite a few interesting identities out there, like Binet\u2019s formula or properties of Fibonacci numbers when used in fractions, that might simplify this expression.\n\n**Step 3: Trying a Telescoping Approach**\n\nI\u2019ll start by breaking down \\(\\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n F_{n+2}}\\) to see if it telescopes. \n\n\\[\n\\frac{F_{n + 1}}{F_n F_{n + 2}} = \\frac{1}{F_n} - \\frac{1}{F_{n+2}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Verify and Reflect on the Telescoping Behavior**\n\nLet's verify the decomposing approach. Rewriting each term as a difference of two fractions suggests it could telescope:\n\n- The first part of the term \\(\\frac{1}{F_n}\\) cancels with a \\(-\\frac{1}{F_n}\\) coming from a later \\(n\\).\n\n- Specifically, for \\(n = 1\\), the first term is \\(\\frac{1}{F_1} - \\frac{1}{F_3} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nIf I write a few terms,\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{F_1} - \\frac{1}{F_3} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{F_2} - \\frac{1}{F_4} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{F_3} - \\frac{1}{F_5} \\right) + \\cdots\n\\]\nMost of these terms indeed cancel out.\n\n**Step 5: Write out a Few Terms**\n\nTo check how they cancel:\n- First term: \\(\\frac{1}{F_1} = 1\\)\n- Second term: \\(-\\frac{1}{F_3} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- Third term: \\(\\frac{1}{F_2} = 1\\)\n- Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{1}{F_4} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n- Next pair: \\(\\frac{1}{F_3}\\), and so forth, continuing like this would demonstrate that it is telescoping.\n\nOh! This is interesting because it confirms the cancellation. Every positive term from a given decomposed element will be subtracted by the negative term from the succeeding term, effectively cancelling out everything but the very first term of the series.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluating Result After Telescoping**\n\nAfter cancelling many of the intermediate terms of the sequence, I'm left with just:\n\\(\\frac{1}{F_1} + \\frac{1}{F_2} = 1 + 1 = 2\\).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAt the end, my evaluation of the series has shown that the sum\n\\[\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{F_{n + 1}}{F_n F_{n + 2}}\\]\nconverges to 2. The telescoping nature of the series was key here, and it allowed us to efficiently simplify and compute the infinite sum.",
