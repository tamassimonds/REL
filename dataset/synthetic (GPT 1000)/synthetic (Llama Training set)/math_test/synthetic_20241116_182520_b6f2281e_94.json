    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I see that we\u2019re dealing with a sphere inscribed in a cube and need to find the volume of the cube, given the volume of the sphere. \n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- A sphere inscribed in a cube means the sphere is perfectly fitted inside the cube, touching all its faces.\n- The given volume of the sphere is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) cubic inches. Hmm, that hints at the sphere's radius and consequently, the cube's dimensions.\n\n### Exploring the Problem:\n1. **Understanding the relationship**: \n   - The diameter of the inscribed sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. That's crucial.\n   - If \\(r\\) is the radius of the sphere, then the diameter and hence the side of the cube, \\(s\\), is \\(2r\\).\n\n2. **Using the formula for the volume of a sphere**:\n   - The volume of a sphere is given by \\(V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\).\n   - We're given this volume: \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\(r\\)**:\n   - I'll try to isolate \\(r\\) now. First, I'll divide by \\(\\pi\\) on both sides:  \n     \\(\\frac{4}{3}r^3 = \\frac{1}{6}\\).\n   - Then multiply both sides by 3:  \n     \\(4r^3 = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n   - Divide by 4 to isolate \\(r^3\\):  \n     \\(r^3 = \\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\n4. **Finding \\(r\\)**:\n   - Take the cube root of both sides to find \\(r\\):  \n     \\(r = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n### Reflections:\n- The calculations seem right, but... let me double-check the relationship between the radius and sphere volume.\n- By substituting \\(r = \\frac{1}{2}\\) back into the formula for volume of a sphere:  \n  \\(V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (\\frac{1}{2})^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\). Yay, it checks out!\n\n### Calculating the Cube's Volume:\n5. **Find the side \\(s\\) of the cube**:\n   - Since \\(s = 2r\\), then \\(s = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\).\n\n6. **Find the volume of the cube**:\n   - The volume \\(V_{\\text{cube}}\\) is \\(s^3\\).\n   - Substitute \\(s = 1\\): \\(V_{\\text{cube}} = 1^3 = 1\\).\n\n### Final Reflection and Conclusion:\n- Everything seems consistent. The calculated side length fits the relationship of inscribed sphere and cube.\n- The volume of our cube is confidently 1 cubic inch.\n- The cross-check of sphere\u2019s volume reassures me I haven\u2019t missed an error or miscalculated an aspect.\n\nSo, the number of cubic inches in the volume of the cube is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",
