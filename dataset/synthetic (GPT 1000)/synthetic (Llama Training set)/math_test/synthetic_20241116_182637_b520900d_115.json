    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The function given is:\n\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{|x^2 + 3x - 4| + |x^2 + 9x + 20|} \\]\n\nWe're asked to find the real values of \\(x\\) that are not in the domain of this function. With functions, the domain is concerned with values of \\(x\\) that might make the function undefined, like division by zero, square roots of negative numbers, etc.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the function**\n\nThe function involves a division by the expression \\(|x^2 + 3x - 4| + |x^2 + 9x + 20|\\). The main thing to focus on here is ensuring the denominator is not zero because division by zero is undefined. So, the first thought is to find when:\n\n\\[\n|x^2 + 3x - 4| + |x^2 + 9x + 20| = 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the expression**\n\nFor the above sum of absolute values to be zero, each absolute value must independently be zero, because absolute values are always non-negative. So, this only happens when:\n\n1. \\(x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + 9x + 20 = 0\\)\n\n**Step 3: Solving the quadratic equations**\n\nLet's solve these equations one by one.\n\n1. Solve \\(x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0\\).\n\nI'll use the quadratic formula, \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 3\\), and \\(c = -4\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-4)}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the solutions are \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -4\\).\n\n2. Solve \\(x^2 + 9x + 20 = 0\\).\n\nUsing the quadratic formula again, where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 9\\), and \\(c = 20\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-9 \\pm \\sqrt{9^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 20}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{-9 \\pm \\sqrt{81 - 80}}{2} = \\frac{-9 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-9 \\pm 1}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the solutions are \\(x = -4\\) and \\(x = -10\\).\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the domain exclusions**\n\nWe have two sets of solutions:\n\n- From \\(x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0\\): \\(x = 1\\), \\(x = -4\\)\n- From \\(x^2 + 9x + 20 = 0\\): \\(x = -4\\), \\(x = -10\\)\n\nNotice \\(x = -4\\) is a common root, which means at \\(x = -4\\), both expressions are zero, leading to:\n\n\\[\n|x^2 + 3x - 4| + |x^2 + 9x + 20| = |0| + |0| = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, this makes \\(f(x)\\) undefined. \n\nChecking other solutions: \n\n- \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -10\\) do not make both quadratic terms zero; they affect only one each. So, at \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -10\\), the sum of the two expressions is not zero because the other expression's absolute value will definitely be positive.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe only value that is not in the domain of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(x = -4\\), because this makes the denominator zero.\n\nHence, the real value of \\(x\\) that is not in the domain of the function is:\n\n\\[ x = -4 \\]",

  "ground_truth": "$x$ is not in the domain of $f$ if the denominator is zero.  Since both absolute values are nonnegative, both must be zero for the denominator to be zero.  So\n\n\\begin{align*}\n0=x^2+3x-4=(x+4)(x-1)&\\Rightarrow x=-4\\text{ or }x=1\\\\\n0=x^2+9x+20=(x+4)(x+5)&\\Rightarrow x=-4\\text{ or }x=-5\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe only value of $x$ which makes both absolute values zero is $x=\\boxed{-4}$."
