    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem step by step. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst, let's really understand what's being asked. We need to find the probability that Ray will choose a prime number when he randomly picks an integer \\( Q \\) such that \\( 34 < Q < 43 \\).\n\n- **Probability** involves favorable outcomes over total outcomes.\n- The integers in the range \\( 34 < Q < 43 \\) are \\( 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 \\).\n\n### Strategy Brainstorming\nThere are 8 integers in total. We need to identify which of these integers are prime:\n- **Prime numbers** are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. \n\n### Checking Each Number for Primality\nLet's go through each number to check if it is a prime:\n\n1. **35**: \n   - Divisible by 5 (35 = 5 \u00d7 7), so not prime.\n2. **36**: \n   - Divisible by 2 (36 = 2 \u00d7 18), so not prime.\n3. **37**: \n   - Check divisibility by primes less than \\(\\sqrt{37}\\) (i.e., 2, 3, 5).\n   - Not divisible by any, thus 37 is prime.\n4. **38**: \n   - Divisible by 2 (38 = 2 \u00d7 19), so not prime.\n5. **39**: \n   - Divisible by 3 (39 = 3 \u00d7 13), so not prime.\n6. **40**: \n   - Divisible by 2 (40 = 2 \u00d7 20), so not prime.\n7. **41**: \n   - Check divisibility by primes less than \\(\\sqrt{41}\\) (i.e., 2, 3, 5).\n   - Not divisible by any, thus 41 is prime.\n8. **42**: \n   - Divisible by 2 (42 = 2 \u00d7 21), so not prime.\n\n### Identifying the Prime Numbers\nFrom the list above, 37 and 41 are the only prime numbers.\n\n### Probability Calculation\nNow, we know the favorable outcomes amongst the integers are 37 and 41.\n\n- **Favorable outcomes**: 2 (37, 41)\n- **Total possible outcomes**: 8 \n\nThus, the probability \\( P \\) that Ray will choose a prime number is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\n### Verification and Reflection\nLet's verify:\n- The list of integers was correctly identified.\n- Each number was checked for primality appropriately.\n- The fraction was reduced correctly.\n\nThe process makes sense, everything checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**: The probability that Ray will choose a prime number is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "$Q\\in\\{35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42\\}$. Only 2 of these 8 numbers are prime: 37 and 41. Thus, the probability that Ray will choose a prime number is $2/8=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."
