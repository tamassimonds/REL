    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem! At first glance, it's asking us about congruence, multiples, and remainders, which gives me that number theory vibe. So, let's start off by trying to understand what we're dealing with: \n\n### Initial Understanding and Exploration:\n\n- We have four integers where no two are congruent mod 6. I know that being congruent mod 6 means two numbers give the same remainder when divided by 6. So, if no two are congruent mod 6, that indicates each of these integers, when divided by 6, leaves a different remainder.\n- The question wants to know about the product \\( N \\) of these four integers and specifically the remainder of \\( N \\) when divided by 6, given that \\( N \\) is not a multiple of 6.\n\n### Exploring the Remainders:\n \n- Let's consider the possible remainders when numbers are divided by 6: they could be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. \n- Since no two integers are congruent mod 6, our four numbers must have remainders from four of the six possibilities.\n- A quick thought about why \\( N \\) might not be a multiple of 6: \\( N \\) being a non-multiple of 6 could mean either 2 or 3 is missing as a factor in each number\u2019s remainder.\n\n### Strategy Development:\n\n1. **Strategy 1: Remaining Possibilities Analysis**\n   - One of the integers can't be 0 mod 6 because then \\( N \\) is automatically a multiple of 6 (as 6 = 2 * 3), which contradicts the question condition. So, we consider remainders 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n2. **Exploring Different Remainder Combinations**:\n   - If we have 1, 2, 3, 4 (since using 5 with 1 is essentially using 0 because 5 + 1 = 6), the product is: \n     - \\( (1) \\times (2) \\times (3) \\times (4) = 24 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6} \\) and it's a contradiction because \\( N \\) should not be a multiple of 6.\n   - Eliminate cases involving 0 or 3 once we've included the numbers 1 and 2 in any pairing. Let's search paths without a strict 2 or 3 combination.\n\n### Trying Different Combinations:\n\n- Okay, let's try actually choosing combinations: \n  *Choose 1, 2, 4, 5*: \n  - \\( 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 40 \\)\n  - Checking modulo 6: \\( 40 \\div 6 = 6\\) remainder = 4, so \\( 40 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6} \\). This works and \\( N \\) is not a multiple of 6.\n  \n*Think*: \n- Explore another setup: pick 1, 2, 5 and 3 (avoid 0 to quickly get multiples of 6):\n  *Choosing 1, 2, 5, 3:*\n  - \\( 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3\\cdot 5 = 30 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6} \\), contradiction\u2014it becomes a multiple of 6.\n\n#### Verifying the Non-Multiples:\n\n- Whenever there\u2019s no 3, you\u2019d escape the strict multiple of 6:\n- Choose 1, 2, 4, 5: Causes remainder = 4 \n\n### Final Answer:\n\n- The remainder of \\( N \\) when divided by 6, given that N is not a multiple of 6 and the integers are 1, 2, 4, 5; yields a remainder of **4**. Keeping it casual with different combinations validated the non-multiples of 6.",

  "ground_truth": "Since no two of the four integers are congruent modulo 6, they must represent four of the possible residues $0,1,2,3,4,5$.\n\nNone of the integers can be $0\\pmod 6$, since this would make their product a multiple of 6.\n\nThe remaining possible residues are $1,2,3,4,5$. Our integers must cover all but one of these, so either 2 or 4 must be among the residues of our four integers. Therefore, at least one of the integers is even, which rules out also having a multiple of 3 (since this would again make $N$ a multiple of 6). Any integer that leaves a remainder of 3 (mod 6) is a multiple of 3, so such integers are not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the four integers must be congruent to $1,2,4,$ and $5\\pmod 6$. Their product is congruent modulo 6 to $1\\cdot 2\\cdot 4\\cdot 5=40$, which leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{4}$."
