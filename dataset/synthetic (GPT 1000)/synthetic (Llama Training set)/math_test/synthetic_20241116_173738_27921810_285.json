    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We want to evaluate \\(\\log_3{27}\\). The goal is to determine the power to which the base (in this case, 3) must be raised to result in 27.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Identifying Pattern**: This looks like a classic logarithm problem involving powers of a number. I remember that \\(27\\) is a small number, and likely, it can be expressed as a power of \\(3\\).\n\n2. **Deconstructing \\(27\\)**: Let's see if we can express \\(27\\) as a power of \\(3\\). Hmm, \\(27\\) is quite close to numbers I've calculated powers for before, like \\(9\\) as \\(3^2\\), and \\(81\\) as \\(3^4\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Expressing 27 as a Power of 3**: Let me try to find how \\(27\\) relates to powers of \\(3\\).\n   - \\(3^1 = 3\\)\n   - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n   - \\(3^3 = 27\\)\n\n   Bingo! \\(27 = 3^3\\).\n\n2. **Using the Logarithmic Definition**: Since I've found that \\(27 = 3^3\\), the definition of a logarithm tells us: \n\n   \\[\n   \\log_3{27} = x \\quad \\text{where} \\quad 3^x = 27\n   \\]\n\n   From our work, \\(3^3 = 27\\), hence:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 3\n   \\]\n\n   So, \\(\\log_3{27} = 3\\).\n\n---\n\n**Checking:**\n\n- **Does it make sense?** Yes, because when I calculated \\(3^3\\), I got \\(27\\), which matches the original number.\n- **Quick mental verification**: Sometimes these problems can have straightforward but mistaken steps. But here, expressing \\(27\\) as a power of \\(3\\) checked out perfectly! \n- **Revisiting the Process**: I followed a straightforward pattern matching strategy that matched \\(27\\) to a power of \\(3\\). There's no contradiction or overlooked detail in rewriting \\(27\\) as \\(3^3\\).\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe value of \\(\\log_3{27}\\) is \\(3\\). The process consisted of pattern recognition in breaking down \\(27\\) into \\(3^3\\), and it clicked without any missteps.\n\nOverall, this was a nice exercise in applying basic log principles with small powers, and I feel confident that \\(\\log_3{27} = 3\\) is correct.",
