    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem of converting the point \\((0,3)\\) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- This looks like converting between coordinate systems, something like converting currencies: both give a way to express the same point or value.\n- I remember polar coordinates involve distance from the origin and an angle from the positive x-axis, which feels sort of like measuring out from a central point in a circle.\n- The point \\((0,3)\\) is already given in rectangular form, which is great because it's essentially x and y coordinates on a Cartesian plane.\n- I need to figure out the radial distance \\(r\\) and the angle \\(\\theta\\).\n\n**Step 1: Start with the Common Strategy**\n\n1. **Formula for \\(r\\):**\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = 3\\). Let me plug these values in:\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Formula for \\(\\theta\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(y = 3\\) and \\(x = 0\\):\n\n   - Wait, \\(\\frac{3}{0}\\) is undefined. How do I handle angles where \\(x = 0\\)? This usually means we're directly on the y-axis.\n   - I realize \\((0,3)\\) is purely vertical, which happens to be on the positive y-axis. The angle should be \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) (90 degrees), based on memory from how angles open up from the positive x-axis. Let me note that down:\n\n   So, \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n**Reflecting on Current Findings**\n\n- Based on these calculations, the polar form should be \\((r,\\theta) = (3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\).\n- This seems right: the distance \\(r\\) measures directly on the vertical, and \\(\\theta\\) aligns perfectly with a 90-degree upward angle. A quick sanity check: my radial distance is indeed positive.\n- Hmm, did I consider all aspects? \\(r > 0\\) and \\(0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi\\) both check out perfectly here.\n  \n**Final Review and Insights:**\n\n- I felt that using geometric understanding (knowing where the point directly lies) helped solidify my answer stronger than just relying on formulas alone.\n- Conceptually, understanding it's part of the special case (axis aligned) helped ensure my angle was accurate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe polar coordinates for the point \\((0,3)\\) are \\((3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\). Problem-solving often feels like this, starting with structured strategies, then sometimes needing to move beyond pure number crunching into geometric intuition!",
