    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The goal is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\(6^3\\) and \\(3^6\\). My initial reaction is to break down these expressions into their prime factors, as this often simplifies the process of finding the GCD.\n\n### First Thoughts:\n- I know \\(6 = 2 \\times 3\\), so I can express \\(6^3\\) in terms of its prime factors.\n- Since \\(3\\) is already a prime number, \\(3^6\\) is straightforward.\n\nLet's factorize both expressions:\n\n### Step-by-Step Factorization:\n\n#### \\(6^3\\):\n- \\(6 = 2 \\times 3\\), so \\(6^3 = (2 \\times 3)^3 = 2^3 \\times 3^3\\).\n\n#### \\(3^6\\):\n- The number \\(3^6\\) is already a power of a prime: \\(3^6 = 3^6\\).\n\n### Writing Down the Factorizations:\n- \\(6^3 = 2^3 \\times 3^3\\)\n- \\(3^6 = 3^6\\)\n\nNow, I should compare the prime factorization of both numbers. The GCD is found by taking the lowest power of each prime factor that appears in both numbers.\n\n### Identifying Common Prime Factors:\n- The common prime factor between the two numbers is \\(3\\).\n- In \\(6^3\\), the power of \\(3\\) is \\(3\\).\n- In \\(3^6\\), the power of \\(3\\) is \\(6\\).\n\n### Determining the GCD:\n- For the prime factor \\(3\\), the lower power is \\(3^3\\).\n\nSo, the GCD of \\(6^3\\) and \\(3^6\\) is \\(3^3\\).\n\n### Calculate \\(3^3\\):\n- \\(3^3 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\).\n\n### Quick Check:\nLet\u2019s quickly verify:\n- If both numbers are divisible by their GCD, \\(27\\), then I\u2019m on the right path.\n- \\(6^3 = 216\\) and \\(216 \\div 27 = 8 \\Rightarrow \\text{divisible}\\).\n- \\(3^6 = 729\\) and \\(729 \\div 27 = 27 \\Rightarrow \\text{divisible}\\).\n\nThis confirms that the GCD is indeed \\(27\\). The approach using prime factorization worked well here, connecting back to basic properties of exponents and prime numbers. This step-by-step breakdown feels solid, and the numbers check out, giving confidence in the solution.\n\n**Final Answer: \\( \\boxed{27} \\)**",

  "ground_truth": "We notice that $6^3 = (2 \\cdot 3)^3 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^3$. Since $2$ does not divide $3^6$, we only need to consider powers of $3$. Indeed, $3^3 = \\boxed{27}$ is the highest power of $3$ which divides both numbers, so it is the greatest common divisor."
