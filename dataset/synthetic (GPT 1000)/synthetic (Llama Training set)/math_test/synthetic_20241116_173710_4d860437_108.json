    "working_out": "First, let me understand what the problem is asking. The question wants me to find the magnitude of the complex number \\(5 - 12i\\). Alright, I've definitely seen problems like this before, so that's a good starting point. The magnitude of a complex number, also known as the modulus, represents the distance of the complex number from the origin in the complex plane.\n\nTo find the modulus of a complex number \\(a + bi\\), the formula is \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\). This comes from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the complex plane, thinking about the real part and the imaginary part as the two sides of a right triangle.\n\nI have the complex number \\(5 - 12i\\). So, here:\n- The real part (\\(a\\)) is \\(5\\), and\n- The imaginary part (\\(b\\)) is \\(-12\\).\n\nNow, according to the formula, I need to take the square root of the sum of the squares of these parts: \\(\\sqrt{5^2 + (-12)^2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate the squares first to ensure I don't make any silly mistakes:\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\((-12)^2 = 144\\)\n\nOkay, now let's add these squares together: \n\\[25 + 144 = 169.\\]\n\nI need to take the square root of \\(169\\) to find the magnitude:\n- \\(\\sqrt{169} = 13\\).\n\nThe magnitude of the complex number \\(5 - 12i\\) is therefore \\(13\\).\n\nLet me reflect and check my work. I applied the modulus formula correctly. I didn't overlook any signs, and I performed the arithmetic carefully. Yes, everything checks out, and the result looks reasonable for a magnitude. \n\nTo double-check, \\(\\sqrt{169} = 13\\) is correct because I know from mental math that \\(13 \\times 13 = 169\\), so I didn't slip up there.\n\nThe problem is solved correctly, and the magnitude is indeed \\(13\\). This approach, using the standard formula for finding the magnitude of a complex number, works perfectly in this case.",
