    "working_out": "First, let's try to fully understand the problem. Kelly and Brenda start from the same place and are both heading to the town of Prime. Kelly drives in two segments, first north and then east, essentially forming a right triangle with her path. Brenda takes a straight path directly to Prime. We're trying to find how much earlier Brenda arrives compared to Kelly.\n\n### Brainstorming Initial Thoughts:\n\n- **Path Kelly Takes:** Kelly drives 9 miles north and then 12 miles east. This forms a right triangle.\n- **Path Brenda Takes:** Brenda takes a straight road to the destination.\n  \nHmm, this seems like a problem involving the Pythagorean theorem since Kelly's path forms a right triangle. Brenda's path would be the hypotenuse, which feels like a key point.\n\n### Calculating Kelly's Total Distance:\n\nOh! Since Kelly's route forms a right triangle, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the direct distance (hypotenuse):\n\n\\[ \\text{Hypotenuse} = \\sqrt{9^2 + 12^2} \\]\n\\[ = \\sqrt{81 + 144} \\]\n\\[ = \\sqrt{225} \\]\n\\[ = 15 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nThis is the distance Brenda travels. Let's ensure we're clear: Kelly doesn't travel the hypotenuse, she takes the sum of the two legs (9 + 12 = 21 miles).\n\n### Calculate Time Taken:\n\nNow, let's calculate how much time each took to travel. I'll utilize the formula \\(\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\\).\n\n1. **Kelly's Time:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Time}_K = \\frac{21 \\text{ miles}}{42 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ hour} \\]\n\n2. **Brenda's Time:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Time}_B = \\frac{15 \\text{ miles}}{45 \\text{ miles per hour}} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hour} \\]\n\n### Determine the Time Difference:\n\nWait, so Kelly took half an hour, and Brenda took a third of an hour. What's the difference?\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nLet\u2019s calculate that:\n\n\\[ = \\frac{3}{6} - \\frac{2}{6} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ hour} \\]\n\nTo find the difference in minutes, multiply by 60:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{6} \\times 60 = 10 \\text{ minutes} \\] \n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBrenda arrived 10 minutes earlier than Kelly. Hmm, let's think... This makes sense, given that Brenda took a direct path which is typically faster, right? I feel confident in this answer. Let me go back and verify all calculations quickly.\n\n- The Pythagorean theorem seems correct.\n- Distance, time, and speed checks line up.\n- The math checks out with \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of an hour resulting beautifully as 10 minutes. \n\nYes, the approach feels solid. Final answer: Brenda arrived 10 minutes earlier than Kelly.",

  "ground_truth": "We can start by drawing a diagram of the routes that each of them took: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,9)--(12,9)--cycle,linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"9\",(0,4.5),W);\nlabel(\"12\",(6,9),N);\nlabel(\"15\",(6,4.5),SE);\n[/asy] The two routes form a 9-12-15 right triangle.  Kelly drove for $9+12=21$ miles at a rate of 42 miles per hour, so she drove for $21/42=.5$ hours which equals 30 minutes.  Brenda drove for 15 miles at an average rate of 45 miles per hour, so she drove for $15/45\\cdot 60=20$ minutes.  Thus, Brenda arrived $30-20=\\boxed{10}$ minutes earlier than Kelly."
