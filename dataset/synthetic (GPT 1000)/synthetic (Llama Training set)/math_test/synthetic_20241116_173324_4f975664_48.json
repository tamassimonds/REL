    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and dissect it thoroughly. We want to find the constant term of the composite function \\( f(g(x)) \\), given \\( f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 3x - 4 \\) and \\( g(x) = x^3 + 5x^2 + 9x - 2 \\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n1. **Understanding Composite Functions**: \n   The function \\( f(g(x)) \\) means that everywhere \\( x \\) appears in the expression for \\( f \\), we replace it with \\( g(x) \\). This sounds straightforward but can become algebraically intensive pretty quickly.\n\n2. **Looking for Shortcuts**:\n   Often, we don't need to compute everything explicitly if we're just looking for a constant term. Constant terms usually aren't affected by the higher-degree parts of a polynomial after substitution. Let's explore if this intuition could simplify our task.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n#### Step 1: Expression for \\( g(x) \\) at a Constant\n- **Think about \\( g(x) \\)**: \n  The key might be to find what value of \\( g(x) \\) will result in specifically affecting the constant term of \\( f \\). \n\n- **Evaluating \\( g(x) \\)**:\n  If we want the constant term of \\( f(g(x)) \\), we might first consider \\( g(x) \\) as a constant. When does a polynomial evaluated at another polynomial contribute to the constant term? Immediately, \\( g(0) \\) comes to mind as the most direct form to consider here.\n\n#### Step 2: Find \\( g(0) \\)\n- **Calculate \\( g(0) \\)**:\n  \\[\n  g(0) = (0)^3 + 5(0)^2 + 9(0) - 2 = -2\n  \\]\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate \\( f(g(x)) \\) for \\( x = 0 \\)\n- **Substitute \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f \\) at \\( x = 0 \\)**:\n  Now substitute \\( g \\)'s value at \\( x=0 \\) into \\( f \\).\n  \\[\n  f(g(0)) = f(-2)\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculate \\( f(-2) \\)**:\n  \\[\n  f(-2) = (-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 4\n  \\]\n  Breaking this down:\n  \\[\n  (-2)^3 = -8\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  6(-2)^2 = 6 \\times 4 = 24\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3(-2) = -6\n  \\]\n  Combine these:\n  \\[\n  f(-2) = -8 - 24 - 6 - 4 = -42\n  \\]\n\n#### Conclusion\n- The constant term of \\( f(g(x)) \\) when expanded is \\(-42\\).\n\n### Reflection\nThis process confirmed our intuitive leap that finding \\( g(0) \\) might directly influence finding the constant term of the composite function. Our calculations matched our logical path, supporting that our approach was valid.\n\nI initially considered expanding \\( f(g(x)) \\) entirely, but trying a value-based substitution was more efficient. This reminds me of situations where substituting simple numbers can immediately show their influence on functions, bypassing complex expansions. I will keep this strategy in mind for similar problems in the future.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $f(g(x)) = g(x)^3 - 6g(x)^2 + 3g(x) - 4$, it suffices to identify the constant terms of $g(x)^3$, $g(x)^2$, and $g(x)$. When expanding $g(x)^3$, we notice that the only way to obtain the constant term is to multiply the constant term with $g(x)$ by itself multiple (3) times: $(-2) \\times (-2) \\times (-2) = -8$. Similarly, the constant term of $g(x)^2$ is $(-2) \\times (-2) = 4$. The constant term in $g(x)$ is $-2$. Substituting gives $(-8) - 6 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\cdot (-2) - 4 = -8 - 24 - 6 - 4 = \\boxed{-42}$."
