    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this congruence problem step by step while also sharing my thought process along the way.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\nWhen I first see a congruence equation like \\(27a \\equiv 17 \\pmod{40}\\), I realize this is similar to linear Diophantine equations or modulo problems I've tackled before. The primary goal is to find positive integer solutions for \\(a\\). \n\nI will start by thinking about any strategies that might apply. One thing that comes to mind is using the Euclidean algorithm to find inverses in modular arithmetic. Another approach could be trial and error within a logical range since the modulo is 40. There might even be better strategies I haven't considered yet, but I'll begin from what's familiar.\n\n### Understanding the Equation:\nThe equation \\(27a \\equiv 17 \\pmod{40}\\) means that when \\(27a\\) is divided by 40, the remainder is 17. I'm looking for the smallest positive solutions, so \\(a\\) should ideally be between 1 and 39 initially since those are the integers that make sense for a modulo 40 problem.\n\n### Strategy Brainstorming:\n- **Trial and Error:** This method may work given the modulo is not too large, but it might be tedious.\n- **Finding the Inverse:** This method rests on finding an integer \\(x\\) such that \\(27x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{40}\\), then multiplying both sides by 17 to solve for \\(a\\). \n- **Using Euclidean Algorithm:** This can help determine if an inverse exists; if \\(\\gcd(27, 40) = 1\\), an inverse does exist.\n\n### Calculating the GCD:\nFirst, check if an inverse can be found using the Euclidean algorithm to confirm \\(\\gcd(27, 40) = 1\\).\n\n- \\(40\\) divided by \\(27\\) gives a remainder of \\(13\\).\n- \\(27\\) divided by \\(13\\) gives a remainder of \\(1\\).\n- Since the next step will have the remainder \\(0\\), and we reached \\(1\\), indeed \\(\\gcd(27, 40) = 1\\).\n\nThis confirms that 27 has an inverse modulo 40.\n\n### Finding the Inverse:\nUse the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the inverse of 27 modulo 40.\n\n- \\(40 = 1 \\times 27 + 13\\)\n- \\(27 = 2 \\times 13 + 1\\)\n- So, \\(1 = 27 - 2 \\times 13\\)\n- Replace 13 with \\(40 - 27\\):\n  - \\(1 = 27 - 2 \\times (40 - 27)\\)\n  - \\(1 = 3 \\times 27 - 2 \\times 40\\)\n\nThus, the inverse of 27 mod 40 is 3. I should double-check that:\n\\[ 27 \\times 3 \\equiv 81 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{40} \\]\nYes, this works since \\(81 \\mod 40 = 1\\).\n\n### Solving for \\(a\\):\nNow that the inverse is 3, calculate \\(a\\) from:\n\\[ a \\equiv 17 \\times 3 \\equiv 51 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{40} \\]\n\nThe smallest positive integer \\(a\\) that satisfies this is 11. Let\u2019s explore for the second smallest:\n\nStarting from \\(11\\), and considering the periodicity of multiples of 40 since:\n\\[ 27(a+40k) \\equiv 17 + 1080k \\equiv 17 \\pmod{40} \\]\n\n\\[ a \\equiv 11 \\pmod{\\frac{40}{\\gcd(27,40)}} \\]\nAdding 40 to 11, we find other solutions:\n\\[ a_2 = 11 + 40 = 51 \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe smallest solution is 11, and the second-smallest is 51. Their sum:\n\\[ 11 + 51 = 62 \\]\n\nQuick Reflections:\n- Tried multiple strategies but inverse and solving was most effective.\n- Double-checked calculations for the inverse and weekly spots.\n- Solution makes logical sense when reviewed within equation context and modulo behavior.\n\nThere we have it, the sum is 62!",

  "ground_truth": "Note that $27$ and $40$ are relatively prime, so $27$ has an inverse $\\pmod{40}$. Conveniently, the inverse of $27\\pmod{40}$ is easily found to be $3$, as we have $27\\cdot 3 = 81\\equiv 1\\pmod{40}$.\n\nTo solve the congruence $27a\\equiv 17\\pmod{40}$, we multiply both sides by $3$ and simplify: \\begin{align*}\n3\\cdot 27a &\\equiv 3\\cdot 17 \\pmod{40} \\\\\na &\\equiv 51 \\pmod{40} \\\\\na &\\equiv 11 \\pmod{40}\n\\end{align*}Each operation in this sequence is reversible, so the solution set is exactly the set of integers congruent to $11\\pmod{40}$. The smallest and second-smallest positive solutions are $11$ and $51$. Their sum is $\\boxed{62}$."
