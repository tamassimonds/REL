    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're dealing with a geometric figure involving a regular pentagon and extensions that form a star, aiming to find the measure of angle $A$. Let's brainstorm our approach.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWhen I see a regular pentagon, I immediately think of its properties. A regular pentagon has equal sides and equal angles. Each interior angle of a regular pentagon is 108 degrees. \n\nThe problem extends the sides of the pentagon to form a star-shaped figure. My initial thought is that this problem could involve figuring out exterior angles or using some properties unique to stars formed by pentagons.\n\n### Step 2: Visualizing the Diagram\nThe star is essentially an overlap of triangles created by extending the pentagon. Each vertex of the pentagon is extended outward, meeting the extensions of adjacent vertices to form tips of the star.\n\n### Step 3: Exploring Initial Strategies\n- **Interior Angles:** The interior angles of the regular pentagon are known. Could these help?\n- **Exterior Angles:** The linear structure certainly suggests these might pitch in, as the pentagon's sides extend to form the star.\n- **Symmetry Considerations:** Since it's a regular figure, symmetry can be very beneficial. The star should have symmetrical angle properties due to its regular construction.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Exterior Angles\nLet's remind ourselves: the exterior angle of a regular polygon (like a pentagon) is calculated using \\(360^\\circ/n\\) where \\(n\\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, that's \\(72^\\circ\\).\n\n### Step 5: Angle at the Star Tips\nNotice that at each point of the star, two exterior angles meet. Since extending the sides in a clockwise or counter-clockwise sequence leads to meeting at a tip, the angle formed there is supplementary to two pentagon exterior angles.\n\n- The configuration at each star tip is an isosceles triangle. So the angle \\(A\\), at each tip, can be calculated as:\n  \\[\n  A = 180^\\circ - 2 \\times 72^\\circ = 180^\\circ - 144^\\circ = 36^\\circ.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 6: Verification Through Symmetry and Polygon Properties\nThe geometry of a regular star formed this way ensures each tip has the same angle due to symmetrically placed extensions. Hence each angle is indeed \\(36^\\circ\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter reflecting on the calculations and going back to the properties of regular polygons and star symmetries, everything falls into place:\n\n**The measure of angle \\(A\\) in the figure is \\(36^\\circ\\).**\n\nThis approach makes sense since each tip of the star, formed by two outward extensions, results in an isosceles triangle with an angle of \\(36^\\circ\\). This is verified technically by basic geometric transformations and conceptual symmetry in the extensions.",

  "ground_truth": "The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so each of the interior angles of regular pentagon $FGHIJ$ has measure $540^\\circ / 5 = 108^\\circ$.  Specifically, $\\angle JFG = 108^\\circ$, so \\[\\angle AFJ = 180^\\circ - \\angle JFG = 180^\\circ - 108^\\circ = 72^\\circ.\\]  Similarly, we have $\\angle AJF = 180^\\circ - 108^\\circ = 72^\\circ$.  Finally, the angles of $\\triangle AFJ$ sum to $180^\\circ$, so \\[\\angle FAJ = 180^\\circ - \\angle AFJ - \\angle AJF = 180^\\circ - 72^\\circ - 72^\\circ = \\boxed{36^\\circ}.\\]"
