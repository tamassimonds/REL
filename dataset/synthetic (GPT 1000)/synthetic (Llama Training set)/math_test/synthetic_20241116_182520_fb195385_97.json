    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. We're asked to find the distance between the two points with coordinates \\((-5, 5)\\) and \\( (5, -5) \\). \n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- At a glance, this problem reminds me of using the distance formula. It's a classic method for finding the distance between two points in a plane.\n- The distance formula seems useful here as I recognize that we are dealing with coordinates on a Cartesian plane. \n- I recall the distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. It involves taking the square root of the sum of the squares of differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates. \n\nOkay, let's remind ourselves of the distance formula itself. It is:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\]\n\nVerify the Coordinates:\n- \\((-5, 5)\\) are my \\(x_1\\) and \\(y_1\\).\n- \\((5, -5)\\) are my \\(x_2\\) and \\(y_2\\).\n  \nHmm, let's see if I've got this right:\n\n- The x-values are \\(-5\\) and \\(5\\). So, the difference is \\(5 - (-5) = 10\\).\n- The y-values are \\(5\\) and \\(-5\\). So, the difference is \\(-5 - 5 = -10\\).\n\nYes, that seems alright. I'm seeing familiar numbers here, so let's proceed.\n\nCalculate the Differences:\n- Change in x: \\(10\\)\n- Change in y: \\(-10\\)\n\nSquare those differences:\n- \\((x_2 - x_1)^2 = 10^2 = 100\\)\n- \\((y_2 - y_1)^2 = (-10)^2 = 100\\)\n\nAt this point, I'm thinking the sum of these squares is \\(100 + 100 = 200\\).\n\nTake the Square Root:\n- Now, take the square root of the sum: \\(\\sqrt{200}\\).\n\nSimplify the Radical:\n- Okay, \\(\\sqrt{200}\\) looks big; let me see if it simplifies.\n- Note that \\(200\\) can be broken down: \\(200 = 100 \\times 2\\), and \\(\\sqrt{100} = 10\\).\n- Thus, \\(\\sqrt{200} = \\sqrt{100 \\times 2} = \\sqrt{100} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 10\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nFinal Result:\n- The distance between the points \\((-5, 5)\\) and \\((5, -5)\\) is \\(10\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nThis all checks out! I'm feeling confident because each step followed logically from the distance formula, and I've double-checked the simplifications. If anything earlier seemed off, I would go back and verify calculations, but all looks good here.",

  "ground_truth": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(5-(-5))^2 + ((-5) - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 100} = \\boxed{10\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nWe note that the points $(-5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, -5)$ form an isosceles right triangle (a 45-45-90 triangle) with legs of length 10. Therefore, the hypotenuse has length $\\boxed{10\\sqrt 2}$."
