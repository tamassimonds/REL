    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: \n- This looks like a triangle geometry problem. We have a triangle \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and an interior point \\(O\\) which forms two equal segments \\(BO = CO\\). \n- There's an \\(104^\\circ\\) angle marked at point \\(O\\). \\(x^\\circ\\) and \\(y^\\circ\\) are marked at points \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), respectively.\n- I have a gut feeling that since \\(BO = CO\\), point \\(O\\) is somehow playing the role of a special point like a circumcenter or incenter, but I need to confirm what \\(BO = CO\\) really means here.\n\n### Explore Strategies\n\n**Brainstorming:** \n1. **Internal Angles:** Try using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.\n2. **Symmetrical Properties:** Since \\(BO = CO\\), maybe \\(\\triangle BOC\\) is isosceles? Could I use the properties of isosceles triangles?\n3. **External vs. Internal Angles:** The \\(104^\\circ\\) angle is tricky. Consider if it's an external angle or the sum of internal angles.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify \\(BO = CO\\):**\n   - Because \\(BO = CO\\), \\(\\triangle BOC\\) is isosceles. This means \\(\\angle OBC = \\angle OCB = \\textcolor{blue}{x}\\).\n\n2. **Angles in a Triangle:**\n   - In \\(\\triangle BOC\\), the sum of the angles must equal \\(180^\\circ\\):\n     \\[\n     \\angle BOC + \\angle OBC + \\angle OCB = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     104^\\circ + x + x = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solving for \\(x\\):**\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     104^\\circ + 2x = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Subtract \\(104^\\circ\\) from both sides:\n     \\[\n     2x = 76^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Divide by 2:\n     \\[\n     x = 38^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n4. Referring to the problem, since both \\(\\angle OBC\\) and \\(\\angle OCB\\) are marked as \\(x^\\circ\\) and \\(y^\\circ\\), and \\(\\triangle BOC\\) is isosceles: \\(\\angle OBC\\) and \\(\\angle OCB\\) are both \\(38^\\circ\\).\n\n5. **Find \\(x + y\\):**\n   - Both angles \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) equal each other in this arrangement due to symmetry (\\(\\angle OBC = x\\) and \\(\\angle OCB = y\\)), which we've found to be \\(38^\\circ\\).\n   - Thus:\n     \\[\n     x + y = 38^\\circ + 38^\\circ = 76^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n### Double Check\n\n- Reviewing each step: Yes, exploring equal segments and angle properties indeed confirmed symmetry within \\(\\triangle BOC\\).\n- The derived equation simplifies logically, and the angle properties check out.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter working through this, the value of \\(x + y\\) is \\(76^\\circ\\). The isosceles triangle properties played a crucial role in simplifying this problem.\n\nAh, I see I've made an error in my initial solution. Let's go back and re-evaluate the problem with a fresh perspective and check for any overlooked details.\n\n### Reflection on the Initial Solution\nUpon reviewing my initial approach, it seems I made an assumption about \\(\\triangle BOC\\) without fully considering the entire \\(\\triangle ABC\\). The symmetrical property clue from equal segments \\(BO = CO\\) led me to focus on \\(\\triangle BOC\\) alone, but the solution involves understanding \\(\\triangle ABC\\) as well.\n\nLet's revise the problem and explore a more accurate approach.\n\n### Exploring Alternative Strategies\n1. **Consider Angle Sum in \\(\\triangle ABC\\):** We know that the sum of angles in any triangle is \\(180^\\circ\\).\n2. **Relook at Symmetry and Isosceles Properties:** Given \\(BO = CO\\), \\(\\triangle BOC\\) is isosceles, but I needed to see the broader implications on \\(\\triangle ABC\\).\n\n### Revised Strategy and Analysis\n1. **Revisiting \\(\\triangle ABC\\):**\n   - Since \\(\\triangle ABD\\) and \\(\\triangle ADC\\) share isosceles properties due to equal segments, I missed linking the angles at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) with \\(\\angle BAC\\).\n\n2. **Understanding the Role of Angle \\(104^\\circ\\):**\n   - Previously, I considered \\(104^\\circ\\) as angle \\(\\angle BOC\\), but recalling it as an exterior angle might have implications on the internal angles of \\(\\triangle ABC\\).\n\n### Corrected Insight and Solution\n1. **Re-evaluate Isosceles Properties:**\n   - \\(\\triangle BDA\\) is isosceles, implying \\(\\angle BAD = \\angle ABD = x^\\circ\\).\n   - \\(\\triangle CDA\\) is isosceles too, implying \\(\\angle CAD = \\angle ACD = y^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Linking Angles for \\(\\triangle ABC\\):**\n   - The sum of angles in \\(\\triangle ABC\\) should relate directly to the combined \\(x^\\circ\\) and \\(y^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Sum of Angles in \\(\\triangle ABC\\):**\n   - For \\(\\triangle ABC\\), using the fact that the total angle sum must be \\(180^\\circ\\),\n     \\[\n     x + y + (x + y) = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying gives:\n     \\[\n     2x + 2y = 180^\\circ \\\\\n     x + y = 90^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter re-evaluating the triangle properties and correctly applying angle relations, the corrected value of \\(x + y\\) is \\(\\boxed{90^\\circ}\\). Reflecting on my initial mistake helped to reinforce the importance of considering all elements of geometric properties, aligning segment relationships to their corresponding angle symmetries and properties.",
