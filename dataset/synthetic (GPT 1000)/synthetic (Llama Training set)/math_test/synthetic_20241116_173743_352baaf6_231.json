    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem!\n\n**First Thoughts**\n\nAt first glance, this problem deals with circle tangency, which feels familiar. However, calculating numerically the number of circles tangent to two given circles and passing through a particular point requires more visualization than typical geometry problems.\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nHere, we have two fixed circles:\n- Circle 1: Center at \\((4,0)\\) with radius 1.\n- Circle 2: Center at \\((-4,0)\\) with radius 1.\n\nWe need a third circle that is tangent to both of these circles and passes through the point \\((0,5)\\).\n\n**Brainstorming Approaches**\n\n1. **Geometric Approach**: Visualize and sketch the situation. Since we are dealing with circle tangencies and a point constraint, this could involve some neat geometric properties or symmetry exploitations.\n\n2. **Algebraic Approach**: Use the conditions of tangency algebraically to set up equations and solve for the parameters (such as radius and center) of the third circle.\n\n3. **Locus of Tangency Centers**: Investigate the paths traced by the centers of circles tangent to both given circles \u2014 often hyperbolas, ellipses, or lines.\n\nLet's start with a geometric intuition and sketching:\n\n**Sketch & Visualize**\n\n- Draw the two fixed circles on the coordinate plane: Circle 1 at \\((4,0)\\) and Circle 2 at \\((-4,0)\\).\n- Identify the point \\((0,5)\\). Visualize how circles can be drawn through this point that are tangent to both fixed circles.\n\n**Reflecting on Tangency**\n\nFor our third circle (say Circle T) to be tangent to both Circle 1 and Circle 2:\n- The distance from its center to each of the centers of Circle 1 and Circle 2 must equal the sum of the radii of Circle 1 and Circle T, as well as Circle 2 and Circle T, respectively. Let\u2019s explore this.\n\n**Algebraic Set-Up**\n\nLet's denote the center of Circle T as \\((h, k)\\) and its radius as \\(r\\). The conditions of tangency give:\n1. \\(\\sqrt{(h - 4)^2 + k^2} = 1 + r\\)\n2. \\(\\sqrt{(h + 4)^2 + k^2} = 1 + r\\)\n3. Additionally, Circle T should pass through \\((0,5)\\), so:\n   \\(\\sqrt{(h - 0)^2 + (k - 5)^2} = r\\)\n\n**Eliminating Possible Dead Ends**\n\nAssuming tangency:\n- Focus first on solving conditions (1) and (2) to get a possible locus or specific points for \\((h, k)\\).\n- Evaluate the significance of passing through \\((0,5)\\) once reasonable center points \\((h, k)\\) are calculated.\n\n**Simplification Attempt**\n\nNotice that both Circle 1 and Circle 2 are symmetric along the y-axis. A symmetry analysis might simplify \\((h, k)\\) without rigorous large computation.\n\n**Analyzing Tangency Equations**\n\nLet's subtract equations derived from conditions (1) and (2) to cancel out terms and perhaps find a simpler relation:\n- \\(\\sqrt{(h-4)^2 + k^2} - \\sqrt{(h+4)^2 + k^2} = 0\\) implies \\((h-4)^2 = (h+4)^2\\). Solving, \\(h = 0\\).\n\n**Final Check with Third Condition**\n\nIf \\(h = 0\\), plug into condition (3):\n- \\(\\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (k-5)^2} = r\\) becomes \\(|k-5| = r\\).\n\nUsing condition 1 or 2 to solve for \\(k\\):\n- \\(\\sqrt{16 + k^2} = 1 + r\\)\n- With \\(r = |k - 5|\\), explore cases for \\(|k - 5|\\) to match tangency.\n\n**Searching for \\(k\\):**\n\nGiven the geometry has a symmetry by the x-axis due to center points, let's further solve:\n- Yes! Plug into \\(k\\) values (hunch feeling to simplify, not drown into radical complexity).\n\n**Verification of Circle Count**\n\nCheck possible geometric solutions satisfy all conditions and ensure symmetry isn't causing missing solutions.\n- Solving indicates only specific concrete solutions: perhaps one or two viable radii producing such intersection circles.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter checking solved equations with conditions and the symmetry exploited:\n- Shapes and tangency confirm two possible circles: one each at \\(h = 0\\) intersection, flipped radii capture.\n- Without further geometrical/drawing solution, hypothesize reasonable conclusion is **two potential tangent circles**.\n\n**Summing Up**\n\nI would propose delivering a clean, verified solution as two indeed possible circles completing the task given two symmetry-related and point-fixed parameters.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem with a fresh perspective and correct any mistakes. We'll explore different strategies and verify each step carefully.\n\n### Re-Evaluating the Problem\nWe need to find circles that are tangent to the two given circles centered at \\((4,0)\\) and \\((-4,0)\\), with radius 1, and pass through the point \\((0,5)\\).\n\n### Strategy and Fresh Brainstorming\n1. **Geometric Insight and Symmetry Exploration**: We've noticed the symmetry in the setup due to the y-axis. Understanding this symmetry can help us visualize potential circle positions. We should also consider the symmetry regarding internal and external tangencies separately.\n\n2. **Corrected Algebraic Setup**:\n\nLet's denote the center of the circle as \\((a, b)\\) and its radius as \\(r\\). We must satisfy:\n- For external tangency to both circles:\n  \\[\n  (a - 4)^2 + b^2 = (r + 1)^2 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (a + 4)^2 + b^2 = (r + 1)^2 \n  \\]\n\n- For internal tangency:\n  \\[\n  (a - 4)^2 + b^2 = (r - 1)^2 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (a + 4)^2 + b^2 = (r - 1)^2 \n  \\]\n\n3. **Exploring External Tangency**:\n\nLet\u2019s first deal with external tangency:\n- Set \\(a = 0\\) from symmetry and subtraction of above circles' conditions. Thus:\n  \\[\n  16 + b^2 = (r + 1)^2 \n  \\]\n- Considering the condition that passes through \\((0,5)\\):\n  \\[\n  (b - 5)^2 = r^2 \n  \\]\n\nSubstitute \\(r = 5b - 5\\) from the simplification and solve:\n- If \\(b = \\frac{5}{3}\\), then \\(r = \\frac{10}{3}\\). This gives one possible circle setup.\n\n4. **Analyzing Internal Tangency**:\n\nFor internal tangency:\n- We use \\(a = 0\\) again:\n  \\[\n  16 + b^2 = (r - 1)^2 \n  \\]\n- Subtracting and simplifying, we find:\n- If \\(b = 0\\), \\(r = 5\\). This contributes one more solution.\n\n5. **Mixed Tangency (Externally to one and Internally to the other)**:\n\n- Consider \\(a = 4a\\) from solving the subtracted conditions; we have:\n  \\[\n  a^2 = \\frac{b^2 + 15}{15}\n  \\]\n  \nChecking through symmetry and condition equations reveals:\n- \\(b = 1\\) results in \\(a = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{15}}\\) and \\(r = \\frac{16}{\\sqrt{15}}\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy exploring and checking these conditions and symmetries, we derived the number of distinct circles meeting the problem's conditions. By examining external, internal, and mixed tangencies, we confirm there are a total of **4 circles** satisfying the original problem\u2019s constraints. This solution covers all possible tangency scenarios respecting the symmetry and the condition of passing through the point \\((0,5)\\).",
