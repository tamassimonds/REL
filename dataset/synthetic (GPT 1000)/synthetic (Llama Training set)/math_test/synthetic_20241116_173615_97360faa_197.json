    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to factor the expression \\( ab + 5b + 2a + 10 \\). \n\n### Step 1: Initial Thoughts\nFirst, I notice that this looks like a polynomial in several variables, and it\u2019s arranged in a linear way. It\u2019s not immediately clear what kind of factoring might apply here, so I\u2019m reminded of problems where grouping terms helps. \n\n### Step 2: Exploring Grouping Terms\nGrouping can sometimes simplify expressions like this. Let\u2019s try to group them in a way that might reveal a common factor. Usually, I look for pairs that share a common factor:\n\n- Group \\( ab \\) and \\( 5b \\): These both have a \\( b \\) in them.\n- Group \\( 2a \\) and \\( 10 \\): These both have no clear immediate common factor, but 10 is a factor of 2 without anything else making sense here.\n\nLet\u2019s respond to these groupings and see where they lead us:\n\n\\[ ab + 5b = b(a + 5) \\]\n\n\\[ 2a + 10 = 2(a + 5) \\]\n\nThis trickery in my mind echoes some familiar patterns! It\u2019s like seeing a single \u201cbig factor\u201d across different terms, kind of exciting because it looks promising.\n\n### Step 3: Regroup and Merge\nI take a moment right here to see if I can factor the entire expression using the (new) common factor \\( (a + 5) \\):\n\nPutting them together, it looks like this:\n\\[ ab + 5b + 2a + 10 = b(a + 5) + 2(a + 5) \\]\n\nDoesn\u2019t it seem like \\( a + 5 \\) appears twice, almost as though it\u2019s begging to be factored out again? My pattern recognition senses are tingling.\n\n### Step 4: Factoring Out the Common Factor\nNow, it\u2019s time to factor out \\( a + 5 \\):\n\n\\[ = (a + 5)(b + 2) \\]\n\nThis feels satisfying. Perfect factoring seems to fit perfectly and equalizes both sides of an equation or expression alike - let\u2019s just check\u2026\n\n### Step 5: Verification\nTo be thorough, let's multiply it back out to ensure it's equivalent to the original expression:\n\\[\n(a+5)(b+2) = ab + 2a + 5b + 10\n\\]\n\nYes! This matches perfectly with our original expression \\( ab + 5b + 2a + 10 \\).\n\n### Reflection\n\nThis turned out to be a clean case of grouping and recognizing a pattern quickly! Reflecting on each grouping decision and internal hesitation brought us here. Factoring by grouping is a reliable strategy anytime you see multiple terms and suspect there\u2019s a hidden structure.\n\nIn future problems like this, I\u2019ll stay alert for any composite terms that might allow for factor sharing and not overlook manual reconfirmation - it aids a confident peace of thought.\n\nFeel free to ask about clarifications or further explorations!",
