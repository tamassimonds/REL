    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem step-by-step and let our thinking flow naturally. \n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nThe problem asks us to find the mean (or average) of two fractions: \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\). \n\n- **First thoughts:** Well, finding the mean typically involves adding the numbers together and dividing by the number of values, which is 2 in this case.\n\n**Step 2: Plan a Strategy**\n\nTo find the mean, we'll follow this general plan:\n1. Add the two fractions: \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{7}{8}\\).\n2. Divide the result by 2 to find the mean.\n\n- **Thoughts:** This seems straightforward. But wait, adding fractions requires a common denominator. I should remember that!\n\n**Step 3: Common Denominator**\n\nHmm, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\). The denominators are 2 and 8, respectively. Let's find a common denominator:\n- **Common Denominator Thoughts:** The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 2 and 8 is 8, right? Yes, 8 is the smallest number that both denominators divide into without a remainder.\n  \n**Step 4: Rewrite Fractions**\n\nLet's rewrite \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) with a denominator of 8:\n- \\(\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{4}{8}\\) (I multiplied the numerator and denominator by 4.)\n\n- **Check:** Okay, \\(\\frac{4}{8}\\) is equivalent to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), so that should be correct.\n\nNow we have:\n- \\(\\frac{4}{8}\\) and \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\).\n\n**Step 5: Add the Fractions**\n\nNext, add these fractions:\n\\[ \n\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{4 + 7}{8} = \\frac{11}{8} \n\\]\n\n- **Thought Reflection:** Hmm, \\(\\frac{11}{8}\\) is an improper fraction. That's fine for now, but let's see what happens when we find the mean.\n\n**Step 6: Finding the Mean**\n\nNow, I'll divide the sum by 2 to find the mean:\n\\[ \n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\frac{11}{8}}{2} = \\frac{11}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{11 \\times 1}{8 \\times 2} = \\frac{11}{16} \n\\]\n\n- **Check:** Dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), which I remembered and applied.\n\n**Step 7: Reflect and Verify**\n\nLet's double-check:\n- I added \\(\\frac{4}{8}\\) and \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\) correctly to get \\(\\frac{11}{8}\\).\n- Divided \\(\\frac{11}{8}\\) by 2 or multiplied by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) properly to get \\(\\frac{11}{16}\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe mean of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\) is \\(\\frac{11}{16}\\).\n\nPhew, my steps seem solid, and the math checks out! Feels good to see the problem through to this solution. Is there a different way? Simplifying first might not really apply, as these fractions weren't overly complex. This method seems straightforward for this level of arithmetic.",
