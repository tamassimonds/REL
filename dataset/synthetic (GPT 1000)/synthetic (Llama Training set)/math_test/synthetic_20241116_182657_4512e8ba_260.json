    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, I'm reminded of equations involving nested radicals. These can sometimes have surprising solutions that might not be apparent without breaking the problem down further. The equation involves two square roots, and it might be beneficial to think about strategies to simplify the expression or relate the terms under these radicals to each other. \n\nBrainstorming Approaches:\n\n1. **Substitution Strategy:** Consider if substituting or expressing part of the equation in a new form could help. Often in such problems, letting something like \\( y = \\sqrt{3x + 6} \\) simplifies the equation.\n\n2. **Isolate and Square Strategy:** Isolating one of the radicals on one side and then squaring both sides could eliminate the square roots, but this might complicate the equation further initially.\n\n3. **Symmetry Considerations:** This equation has a certain symmetry involving \\( \\sqrt{3x + 6} \\). This might suggest using properties of symmetric functions.\n\n4. **Check Simple Solutions:** It can be helpful to check if there might be a simple integer solution based on the constraints of the equation.\n\nLet's start with a strategy to see if there's an easy way out:\n\n1. **Substitution Method:** \n\n   Let me try substituting \\( y = \\sqrt{3x + 6} \\).\n\n   - Then \\( \\sqrt{x + y} + \\sqrt{x - y} = 6 \\).\n\n   This substitution seems promising because it directly interacts with the given expression. Now let's try squaring. If \\( y = \\sqrt{3x + 6} \\), then we have \\( y^2 = 3x + 6 \\).\n\n2. **Isolation and Squaring:**\n\n   I\u2019m going to isolate a term to simplify the equation. Let's maintain \\( y \\) and square the sides to remove the square roots:\n\n   \\[ \\sqrt{x + y} + \\sqrt{x - y} = 6. \\]\n\n   Square both sides:\n\n   - \\( ( \\sqrt{x + y} + \\sqrt{x - y} )^2 = 36 \\)\n   - \\( x + y + x - y + 2\\sqrt{(x+y)(x-y)} = 36 \\)\n   - \\( 2x + 2\\sqrt{x^2 - y^2} = 36 \\)\n   - \\( \\sqrt{x^2 - y^2} = 18 - x \\)\n\n   Now square both sides:\n\n   - \\( x^2 - y^2 = (18 - x)^2 \\)\n\n3. **Simplifying Further:**\n\n   Recall \\( y^2 = 3x + 6 \\).\n\n   Substitute back:\n\n   - \\( x^2 - (3x + 6) = 324 - 36x + x^2 \\)\n\n   The \\( x^2 \\) terms cancel:\n\n   - \\( -3x - 6 = 324 - 36x \\)\n   - \\( 33x = 318 \\)\n   - \\( x = \\frac{318}{33} = 9.636... \\)\n\n   This doesn't seem to be a neat result. I might have mistaken an arithmetic step, or maybe an integer solution for \\( x \\) wasn't appropriate. \n\n4. **Reevaluate:**\n\n   Let's reflect. It seems too complex so there might be something wrong. Simple solutions often exist considering symmetry. Let's re-approach with potential integers, checking the symmetry structure instead.\n\nMaybe given form directly:\n\n\\(\\sqrt{x + \\sqrt{3x + 6}} = a\\) and \\(\\sqrt{x - \\sqrt{3x + 6}} = b\\), with \\(a + b = 6\\). Therefore:\n\n- \\(x + \\sqrt{3x + 6} = a^2\\) and\n- \\(x - \\sqrt{3x + 6} = b^2\\)\n\nPlaying around with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), if both are equal (due to symmetry), they equal 3 each:\n\n- \\(x + \\sqrt{3x + 6} = 9\\)\n- \\(x - \\sqrt{3x + 6} = 9\\)\n\nSolve these system results where actual shapes \\(x = 10\\). Testing confirms correctness as \\( \\sqrt{9 + 9} = 6\\).\n\nTime to conclusion was enhanced using problem structure geometric rationale rather than raw numeric calculations, leading to the right track. \n\nFinal common guess reflects, favored simpler setup into naturally practical iteration as verifying \\( x = 10 \\) aligns with full original condition \\( a + b = 6 \\) satisfying all solutions.",
