    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. \n\n## Initial Thoughts:\n\n- The problem is asking to find an integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\equiv 12345 \\pmod{6} \\) and \\( 0 \\le n \\le 5 \\). This means we need the remainder when 12345 is divided by 6.\n\n- This is a modulus operation finding, and based on my past experience, this often just boils down to simple division to find the remainder.\n\n## Step 1: Explore Strategies\n\n### Strategy 1: Direct Calculation of Modulus\n- I'm thinking the simplest method could be to directly divide 12345 by 6 and find the remainder. This seems straightforward, so let's try this first.\n\n### Strategy 2: Calculation Using Properties\n- Another approach might use properties of numbers, such as breaking down the calculation into more manageable parts. I won't go this route unless necessary since direct division is quite simple for this modulus operation.\n\n### Strategy 3: Use Patterns\n- Recognizing patterns could work if the number given was too large, but since this is a straightforward division problem, let's keep it simple unless needed.\n\n## Step 2: Perform Division\n\n- Calculating \\( 12345 \\div 6 \\) will give a quotient and remainder. The remainder will tell us the equivalent number \\( n \\) modulo 6.\n\n## Step 3: Calculating \\( 12345 \\div 6 \\)\n\n- Doing the long division:\n  - 6 goes into 12 twice, remainder 0.\n  - Bring down the 3, 6 goes into 3 zero times, remainder 3.\n  - Bring down the 4, 6 goes into 34 five times, remainder 4.\n  - Finally, bring down the 5, 6 goes into 45 seven times, remainder 3.\n\n- Therefore, the remainder is 3.\n\n## Step 4: Verification\n\n- 12345 divided by 6 is not perfectly divisible, resulting in a remainder of 3.\n  \n- To verify, \\( 12345 = 2057 \\times 6 + 3 \\). This checks out because multiplying back gives \\( 2057 \\times 6 = 12342 \\) and \\( 12342 + 3 = 12345 \\).\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\n\n- Therefore, \\( n = 3 \\) because \\( 12345 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\) and \\( 0 \\leq n \\leq 5 \\).\n\nFinal answer: The integer \\( n \\) is \\( \\boxed{3} \\).",
