    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem together. The goal seems clear: we have two dice with unusual faces, and we need to find out the probability that their sum is odd. Let's start with some initial thoughts and brainstorming.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n1. **Understanding the Dice Configuration**: \n   - The first die has faces: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3.\n   - The second die has faces: 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6.\n   - Oh, this is interesting because these aren't standard dice. They're heavily loaded towards smaller numbers.\n\n2. **Odd Sums**:\n   - Generally, to get an odd sum, one number must be odd and the other even.\n   - Maybe we can use that principle here to sort things out.\n\n3. **Possible Strategies**:\n   - Calculate all possible sums and count the odd ones.\n   - Use combinations of even and odd face outcomes to find the probability.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Write Down Possible Outcomes**:\n   - Let's list all sums from rolling the dice. For each die, there are three possible outcomes, so we have \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) combinations for each die's face.\n   - The sums of each pair of outcomes from the two dice. This might give us an exhaustive list and help us quickly identify the odd sums.\n   \n2. **Combining Outcomes**:\n   - For die one we have odd faces {1, 3} (each twice) and an even face {2} (also twice).\n   - For die two we have even faces {4, 6} (each twice) and an odd face {5} (also twice).\n\n3. **Calculate Combinations for Odd Sum**:\n   - Let's pair an odd face from die one with an even face from die two.\n   - Pair an even face from die one with an odd face from die two.\n   \n4. **Outcome Calculation**:\n   - **Odd + Even**:\n     - Face 1 & Face 4: 1 + 4 = 5 (odd)\n     - Face 1 & Face 6: 1 + 6 = 7 (odd)\n     - Face 3 & Face 4: 3 + 4 = 7 (odd)\n     - Face 3 & Face 6: 3 + 6 = 9 (odd)\n   - **Even + Odd**:\n     - Face 2 & Face 5: 2 + 5 = 7 (odd)\n\n   Let's break this down further considering the repetition:\n   - 1 can be paired with 4 or 6 giving 4 outcomes.\n   - 3 can also be paired with 4 or 6 giving another 4 outcomes.\n   - 2 can be paired with 5 for 4 outcomes.\n\n5. **Counting Total Outcomes**:\n   - Since each face number is repeated twice, it's \\(2 \\times\\) those pairings we found when calculating the combinations.\n   - Total combinations with odd sums = \\(2 \\times (4 + 4 + 4) = 24\\).\n\n### Final Probability Calculation\n\n6. **Calculate Total Possible Rolls**:\n   - Both dice have three different faces each appearing twice, so 6 choices per die.\n   - Total outcomes = \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\).\n\n7. **Calculate Probability**:\n   - Probability of an odd sum = Number of favorable outcomes/Total outcomes.\n   - Probability = 24/36 = 2/3.\n\n### Reflection\n\n- Okay, let's think about this: With the way we've calculated, everything checks out.\n- Checked all outcomes thoroughly, seems consistent with the short cuts used.\n- The approach using combinations and examining face outcomes has made the process manageable.\n- Final quick check: my mental arithmetic works out since I tied the outcome with checking repetition.\n\nAt this point, I'm confident in saying that the probability of rolling an odd sum with these two dice is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). If there\u2019s a simpler way, feel free to suggest it, but I feel our solution method gives a clear path through this problem.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculation. Let's go through it again and explore different strategies to ensure we get the correct probability.\n\n### Re-evaluation and Brainstorming\n\nUpon reviewing the problem, we need to focus on achieving an odd sum from the two specialized dice. Here's a clearer breakdown:\n\n1. **Understanding the Dice Again**:\n   - The first die has faces 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3.\n   - The second die has faces 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6.\n\n2. **Odd Sum Condition**:\n   - An odd sum occurs when one die shows an odd number and the other shows an even number.\n\n3. **Defining the Faces**:\n   - On the first die, we have:\n     - Odd faces: 1 and 3 (each appears twice).\n     - Even face: 2 (appears twice).\n   - On the second die, we have:\n     - Even faces: 4 and 6 (each appears twice).\n     - Odd face: 5 (appears twice).\n\n### Strategy Re-Evaluation\n\n#### A. Direct Calculation Approach\n\n**1. Odd on First, Even on Second:**\n   - Odd faces on the first (1, 3) combined with even faces on the second (4, 6).\n   - These pairings give us (1+4, 1+6, 3+4, 3+6): all odd sums.\n\n**2. Even on First, Odd on Second:**\n   - Even faces on the first (2) combined with odd faces on the second (5).\n   - Pairing (2+5) gives us an odd sum.\n\nNow, let's calculate based on face occurrences:\n- **Odd+Even:**\n  - 1 appears twice, and it can pair with 4 and 6 (each twice), leading to \\(2 \\times 2 + 2 \\times 2 = 8\\) outcomes.\n  - 3 appears twice, and it can pair with 4 and 6 (each twice), leading to another 8 outcomes.\n  \n- **Even+Odd:**\n  - 2 appears twice, and it can pair with 5 (twice), leading to 4 outcomes.\n\nTotal favorable outcomes for an odd sum = \\(8 + 8 + 4 = 20\\).\n\n#### B. Probability Calculation\n\n1. **Total Outcomes:**\n   - Each die has 6 sides due to repetition of faces, so there are \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) total possible outcomes.\n\n2. **Probability of Odd Sum:**\n   - Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total possible outcomes = \\(20/36 = 5/9\\).\n\n### Reflections and Conclusion\n\n- Hmmm, using the revised method confirms an odd sum probability of \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\).\n- It distinctly contrasts with my previous calculation of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), highlighting how crucial it is to carefully consider repetition and the combinations correctly.\n- This method focused on the probabilities of combinations rather than merely counting straightforward sums or outcomes, ensuring clearer and more accurate results.\n\nIncorporating this approach leads us to confidently conclude that the probability of rolling an odd sum with these dice configurations is \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\). This resonates well with the logical structure of combinations and their probabilities.",
