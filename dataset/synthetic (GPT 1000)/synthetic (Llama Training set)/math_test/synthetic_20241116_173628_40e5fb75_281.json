    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle the problem by brainstorming and breaking down the expression step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe operation given is \\( a \\star b = \\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{1}{b} - \\dfrac{1}{a}\\right)}{(a - b)} \\). We need to find \\( 3 \\star 11 \\). \n\nWhen I first see this problem, it reminds me of dealing with fractions and differences, and there's a division by \\( a - b \\), so I should pay attention to how things simplify. It looks like a complex fraction that might reduce neatly if handled correctly.\n\n### Step 2: Substitute Known Values\nLet's start by substituting \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( b = 11 \\) into the expression.\n\n\\[ 3 \\star 11 = \\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{1}{11} - \\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)}{(3 - 11)} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Numerator\nLet's work on the numerator \\(\\dfrac{1}{11} - \\dfrac{1}{3}\\).\n\nFinding a common denominator:\n- The common denominator of 11 and 3 is 33.\n\nConverting fractions:\n\\[ \\dfrac{1}{11} = \\dfrac{3}{33} \\]\n\\[ \\dfrac{1}{3} = \\dfrac{11}{33} \\]\n\nSubtract these:\n\\[ \\dfrac{1}{11} - \\dfrac{1}{3} = \\dfrac{3}{33} - \\dfrac{11}{33} = \\dfrac{3 - 11}{33} = \\dfrac{-8}{33} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Denominator\nCalculate \\( (3 - 11) \\):\n\\[ 3 - 11 = -8 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Plug into the Original Expression\nSubstitute back into the expression for \\( \\star \\):\n\\[ 3 \\star 11 = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{-8}{33}}{-8} \\]\n\nThis simplifies as follows:\n- The \\(-8\\) in the numerator and the denominator cancel each other out.\n\n\\[ 3 \\star 11 = \\dfrac{-8}{33} \\div -8 = \\dfrac{-8}{33} \\times \\dfrac{1}{-8} = \\dfrac{-8 \\times 1}{33 \\times -8} = \\dfrac{1}{33} \\]\n\n### Step 6: Verify the Solution\nThe fractions and arithmetic check out; the operations match up with the given function \\( a \\star b \\). The answer simplifies to a clean fraction without any unexpected outcomes or undefined operations. \n\n### Final Answer\nSo, \\( 3 \\star 11 \\) expressed as a common fraction is:\n\\[ \\dfrac{1}{33} \\]\n\nReflecting on the steps, everything was straightforward after breaking down the components and handling the fraction arithmetic carefully. Let me know if there's anything more to explore or if another approach might be beneficial!",

  "ground_truth": "We could plug in 3 and 11 to find the answer. However, note that $a \\star b = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{a - b}{ab}}{a - b} = \\dfrac{1}{ab}$. Therefore, $3 \\star 11 = \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 11} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{33}}$."
