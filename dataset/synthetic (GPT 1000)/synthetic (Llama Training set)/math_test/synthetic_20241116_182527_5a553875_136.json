    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\nOkay, so we have a rational function \\( y = \\frac{27x^2 + 9x + 3}{27x^3 + 9x^2 + 3x + 1} \\). This definitely looks like a problem related to horizontal asymptotes, which I remember involves comparing the degrees of the numerator and denominator. My first instinct is to figure out how the degrees of the polynomial functions in the numerator and the denominator determine the horizontal asymptote.\n\nInitial brainstorming:\n\n1. **Degrees of Polynomials**: The degree of the numerator is 2, and the degree of the denominator is 3. Ah! This is starting to remind me of some rules from calculus\u2014specifically, rules about horizontal asymptotes found in rational functions.\n\n2. **Rules for Horizontal Asymptotes**:\n   - If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\).\n   - If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = \\frac{\\text{leading coefficient of the numerator}}{\\text{leading coefficient of the denominator}} \\).\n   - If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (although there might be an oblique asymptote).\n\nReflecting on these rules, considering our problem:\n\n- The numerator has degree 2, and the denominator has degree 3. So, based on the rules I remember, the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator.\n\nAha moment:\n\n- This means that the horizontal asymptote should be \\( y = 0 \\). That's a relief to figure out because the situation fits one of the straightforward cases.\n\nChecking work:\n\n- I should double-check that my memory of the rules for horizontal asymptotes is correct, but this feels right given what I remember.\n- The numerators and denominators align with what's expected for the degree comparison method.\n- It's smart to briefly verify if there's anything in the smaller terms or constants that could change this, but intuitively they would vanish as \\( x \\to \\infty \\).\n\nFinal conclusion:\n\nGiven that the degree of the numerator is 2 and the degree of the denominator is 3, the value of \\( y \\) at which there will be a horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). My reasoning aligns well with the rules I remembered for horizontal asymptotes for rational functions, so I'm confident in this answer.",

  "ground_truth": "For a rational function, when the degree of the numerator is smaller than the degree of the denominator, the denominator grows at a faster rate than the numerator. In this case, the numerator has a degree of 2 while the denominator has a degree of 3. Thus, the function approaches the asymptote $y=\\boxed{0}$."
