    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, keeping in mind that it's important to show my thought process and brainstorming throughout the solution.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- The problem looks like it involves some basic exponentiation and arithmetic.\n- The expression consists of two terms: \\(2^{(2^3)}\\) and \\((2^2)^3\\), and we're asked to calculate the difference between them.\n- At first glance, this reminds me of exercises in evaluating expressions using the rules of exponents.\n  \nGiven the expression \\(2^{(2^3)} - (2^2)^3\\), let's take it one part at a time.\n\n### Breaking Down the Problem\n\n**First Part: \\(2^{(2^3)}\\)**\n- **Thinking**: We have an exponent raised to another exponent. This feels a bit like a power tower, though on a simpler scale.\n- \\(2^3\\) is the inner part of the exponent. Calculating \\(2^3\\):\n  \\[\n  2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\n  \\]\n- Now substituting back, the expression becomes:\n  \\[\n  2^8\n  \\]\n- **Calculation of \\(2^8\\)**: \n  \\[\n  2^8 = 256\n  \\]\n- So, the first part \\(2^{(2^3)}\\) equals \\(256\\).\n\n**Second Part: \\((2^2)^3\\)**\n- **Thinking**: Okay, this looks a bit simpler. We have a base raised to an exponent, and that result is raised to another exponent. Maybe I can use the power of a power rule here?\n- Calculate \\(2^2\\):\n  \\[\n  2^2 = 4\n  \\]\n- Now, substitute back:\n  \\[\n  (2^2)^3 = 4^3\n  \\]\n- **Calculation of \\(4^3\\)**:\n  \\[\n  4^3 = 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64\n  \\]\n- Thus, \\((2^2)^3\\) equals \\(64\\).\n\n### Putting It All Together\n\n- **Thoughts**: I\u2019ve broken down the two parts separately. Now let me find the difference.\n- Calculate the difference between the two results:\n  \\[\n  2^{(2^3)} - (2^2)^3 = 256 - 64\n  \\]\n\n**Difference Calculation**:\n- \\(256 - 64 = 192\\)\n\n### Check Your Work \n\n- **Quick Check**: Do the numbers seem reasonable? I'm thinking, \\(256 - 64\\) does indeed equal \\(192\\).\n  \n- **Reflection**: Both calculations for \\(2^{(2^3)}\\) and \\((2^2)^3\\) match my understanding of exponential rules. No obvious mistakes in steps. The process seems logically sound.\n\n- **Random Insight**: Yes, this feels like when I learned about the power of a power rule and simplifying expressions using exponents.\n\nSo, my final conclusion is that the value of \\(2^{(2^3)} - (2^2)^3\\) is \\(192\\). Feels good to have a logical and verified solution!",

  "ground_truth": "Recall that $\\left(a^m\\right)^n=a^{mn}$. Because of this, the second number is $\\left(2^2\\right)^3=2^{2\\cdot 3}=2^6$. Because the exponents in the first number are in parentheses, we must complete that exponentiation first. $2^3=8$, so the first number is $2^{(2^3)}=2^8$. Thus, we have  \\[2^8-2^6.\\] Evaluating these exponents and subtracting, we get $256-64=\\boxed{192}$."
