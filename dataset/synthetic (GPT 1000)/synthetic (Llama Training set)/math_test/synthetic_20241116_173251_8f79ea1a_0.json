    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Here's my initial thought process and how I'm going to tackle it step by step.\n\n### Initial Reaction\nWhen I see that we have an odd function \\( f(x) \\) and a point \\((-3, 5)\\) on its graph, I immediately remember that odd functions have a specific symmetry property. Hmm, this seems familiar... Oh yes, if a function is odd, then for every point \\( (x, y) \\) on the graph, there must be a corresponding point \\((-x, -y)\\) as well. This comes from the definition of odd functions, where \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\).\n\n### First Idea\nLet's explore if using this property directly gives us the next point. \n\n1. We have the point \\((-3, 5)\\).\n2. Using the property of odd functions, \\((-x, -y)\\), the point corresponding to \\((-3, 5)\\) would be:\n   - \\( x \\) becomes \\(-(-3) = 3\\)\n   - \\( y \\) becomes \\(-5\\)\n\nSo another point that must be on the graph is \\( (3, -5) \\).\n\n### Quick Check\nThis seems correct because the transformation from \\((-3, 5)\\) to \\( (3, -5) \\) matches the symmetry of rotating the point 180 degrees around the origin, which aligns with the nature of odd functions.\n\n- We started with the idea that \\((-x, -y)\\) should be on the graph if \\((x, y)\\) is.\n- Converting \\((-3, 5)\\) to an \\((x, y)\\) pair under the odd function rule results in \\((3, -5)\\).\n\n### Reflecting on the Approach\nThe transformation checks out and doesn't reveal any contradictions. Also, since odd functions inherently satisfy this symmetry, reaching \\((3, -5)\\) as a point seems logically sound. \n\n### Final Check\n- Definition Recap: Since \\( f(x) \\) is odd, if \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\), and we have a point on the graph, this relationship holds true symmetrically for opposite inputs.\n  \nEverything aligns well with the rules of odd functions, and I don't see any loose ends. Therefore, I am confident that the additional point the graph must pass through is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(3, -5)}\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "Since $f(x)$ is an odd function, $f(-x) = -f(x).$  In particular,\n\\[f(3) = -f(-3) = -5.\\]Therefore, the graph of $f(x)$ must also pass through the point $\\boxed{(3,-5)}.$\n\nAlso,\n\\[f(0) = -f(0),\\]so $f(0) = 0.$  Thus, $\\boxed{(0,0)}$ is also an acceptable answer.  (This is assuming that $f(x)$ is defined at $x = 0.$)"
