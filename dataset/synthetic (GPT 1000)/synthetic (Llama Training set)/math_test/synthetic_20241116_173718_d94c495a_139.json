    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll try to reflect my thought process as I go:\n\n**Understanding the problem:**\n\nWe need to find the midpoint of a segment whose endpoints are the midpoints of two given segments. The segments are defined by their endpoints:\n\n- Segment \\(s_1\\) with endpoints \\((3+\\sqrt{2}, 5)\\) and \\((4, 7)\\).\n- Segment \\(s_2\\) with endpoints \\((6-\\sqrt{2}, 3)\\) and \\((3, 5)\\).\n\n**First thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so this seems like a classic midpoint of a line segment problem, but with a little twist because we first need to find midpoints of the given segments and then another midpoint. I know the formula for the midpoint of a segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\\). I\u2019ll definitely be using that here. This reminds me of similar problems I've encountered, so I feel confident about this approach.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1. Calculate the midpoint of \\(s_1\\).\n2. Calculate the midpoint of \\(s_2\\).\n3. Use the midpoints of \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\) as endpoints to find the midpoint of the new segment.\n\n**Calculating the midpoint of \\(s_1\\):**\n\nThe endpoints are \\((3+\\sqrt{2}, 5)\\) and \\((4, 7)\\).\n\n- Midpoint \\(M_1 = \\left(\\frac{(3+\\sqrt{2}) + 4}{2}, \\frac{5 + 7}{2}\\right)\\)\n\nFirst, calculate the \\(x\\)-coordinate:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(3+\\sqrt{2}) + 4}{2} = \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the \\(y\\)-coordinate:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{5 + 7}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the midpoint \\(M_1\\) of \\(s_1\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{7+\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 6\\right)\\).\n\n**Calculating the midpoint of \\(s_2\\):**\n\nThe endpoints are \\((6-\\sqrt{2}, 3)\\) and \\((3, 5)\\).\n\n- Midpoint \\(M_2 = \\left(\\frac{(6-\\sqrt{2}) + 3}{2}, \\frac{3 + 5}{2}\\right)\\)\n\nFirst, calculate the \\(x\\)-coordinate:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(6-\\sqrt{2}) + 3}{2} = \\frac{9 - \\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the \\(y\\)-coordinate:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{3 + 5}{2} = 4\n\\]\n\nSo, the midpoint \\(M_2\\) of \\(s_2\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{9-\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 4\\right)\\).\n\n**Finding the midpoint of the segment connecting \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\):**\n\nNow we use \\(\\left(\\frac{7+\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 6\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{9-\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 4\\right)\\) to find the midpoint:\n\nMidpoint \\(M = \\left(\\frac{\\left(\\frac{7+\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{9-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)}{2}, \\frac{6 + 4}{2}\\right)\\).\n\nFirst, calculate the \\(x\\)-coordinate:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{7+\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{9-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)}{2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{16}{2}\\right)}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the \\(y\\)-coordinate:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{6 + 4}{2} = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, the midpoint of the segment with endpoints at the midpoints of \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\) is \\((4, 5)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFeeling pretty confident about the method and calculations. Everything checks out logically according to the midpoint formula. This seems consistent with other similar geometry problems I've seen. I don't see any oversights, so I feel good about this result.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe midpoint of the segment with endpoints at the midpoints of \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\) is \\((4, 5)\\).",
