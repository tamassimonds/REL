    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem methodically. We are given the expression \\(49x^2 + 14x(19-7x) + (19-7x)^2\\) and need to simplify it.\n\n**First Impressions:**\n- Initial glance at the expression shows that it involves a quadratic in terms of \\(x\\). \n- The expression can be reorganized to identify a possible pattern or simplification.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Expression**\n- The expression is \\(49x^2 + 14x(19-7x) + (19-7x)^2\\).\n- At first glance, it bears resemblance to the expanded form of a polynomial and contains a mix of binomials.\n\n**Step 2: Explore Possible Strategies**\n- The expression seems to contain recognizable components. Specifically, I see \\(49x^2\\), which is \\((7x)^2\\).\n- The expression has a combination of quadratic terms and a binomial expansion. Could factorization play a role?\n- It might also help to expand and simplify terms individually.\n\n**Step 3: Decomposition and Simplification**\n- Let\u2019s expand \\(14x(19-7x)\\):\n\n  \\[\n  14x(19 - 7x) = 14x \\times 19 - 14x \\times 7x = 266x - 98x^2\n  \\]\n\n- Next, expand \\((19-7x)^2\\):\n\n  \\[\n  (19-7x)^2 = 19^2 - 2 \\times 19 \\times 7x + (7x)^2 = 361 - 266x + 49x^2\n  \\]\n\n**Step 4: Combine All Terms**\n- Now, we need to combine all the terms:\n\n  \\[\n  49x^2 + (266x - 98x^2) + (361 - 266x + 49x^2)\n  \\]\n\n- Combine like terms:\n\n  - Quadratic Terms: \\(49x^2 - 98x^2 + 49x^2 = 0x^2\\)\n  - Linear Terms: \\(266x - 266x = 0x\\)\n  - Constant Term: \\(361\\)\n\n**Step 5: Simplification and Conclusion**\n- We\u2019ve arrived at a simplification where almost every term cancels out except for the constant term:\n\n  \\[\n  49x^2 + 266x - 98x^2 + 361 - 266x + 49x^2 = 361\n  \\]\n\n- Essentially, the original expression simplifies to 361, irrespective of the value of \\(x\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This problem seemed complex but simplified beautifully after expanding and combining terms.\n- All variable-dependent terms canceled out, leaving the constant term, indicating a structured expression designed for cancellation.\n- This aligns with an algebraic identity or a clever setup.\n\nThe final simplified expression is \\(\\boxed{361}\\).\n\nLet me double-check each step to confirm: I effectively expanded, combined terms, and calculated the constants, ensuring no miscalculation. The solution stands as correct as per the working; no apparent alternative approach is needed given the straightforward nature of simplification via expansion and combination.",
