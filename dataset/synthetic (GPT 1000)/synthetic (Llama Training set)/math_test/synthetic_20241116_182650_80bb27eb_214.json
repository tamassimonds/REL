    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem methodically. We're trying to express the quadratic $2z^2 + 13z + 21$ in the form $(z + a)(2z + b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. Our ultimate goal is to find $2a + b$. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe expression is a quadratic trinomial, and the problem hints that it can be factored into two binomials of specific forms. This looks like a problem related to factoring trinomials, but there's a twist because the binomials aren't equal as they normally would be (i.e., they're not both in the form $(z + m)(z + n)$ but have different coefficients, $(z + a)(2z + b)$). \n\n### Step 2: Compare Coefficients\nLet's think about how to match coefficients here:\n\n- The product of the binomials $(z + a)(2z + b)$ should equal $2z^2 + 13z + 21$ after expanding.\n- Expanding the left side, we get: $(z + a)(2z + b) = z(2z + b) + a(2z + b) = 2z^2 + bz + 2az + ab = 2z^2 + (b + 2a)z + ab$.\n\nNow, we can set up a system of equations by comparing this expanded form to $2z^2 + 13z + 21$:\n1. The coefficient of $z^2$: $2 = 2$. This is satisfied and doesn't provide new information.\n2. The coefficient of $z$: $b + 2a = 13$.\n3. The constant term: $ab = 21$.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the System\nLet's focus on the equations $b + 2a = 13$ and $ab = 21$. We can use substitution or elimination strategies to solve this. Let's test a few integer pairs that multiply to 21 because they are usually limited:\n\n- Possible pairs for $(a, b)$ considering $ab = 21$: $(1, 21)$, $(3, 7)$, $(-1, -21)$, $(-3, -7)$. \n\nBut we need them to satisfy $b + 2a = 13$ as well.\n\n#### Testing the Pairs:\n1. Try $(a = 3, b = 7)$:\n   - Check $3 \\cdot 7 = 21$. This works.\n   - Check $b + 2a = 7 + 2 \\cdot 3 = 7 + 6 = 13$. Yes, this pair satisfies both conditions.\n\n2. Double checking other feasible pairs isn't necessary because $(3, 7)$ satisfies the criteria already.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating $2a + b$\nNow that we have $a = 3$ and $b = 7$, compute $2a + b$:\n- Calculate $2a + b = 2 \\cdot 3 + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13$.\n\n### Step 5: Reflect and Verify\nOops, seems like I computed the target value before considering the straightforward logic involved -- let's pause, reflect:\n\n- Check expansion for any errors: Expand $(z + 3)(2z + 7) = 2z^2 + 6z + 7z + 21 = 2z^2 + 13z + 21$. Yes, this matches the original expression.\n\nCrisis averted, the calculation matches the correct answer. We verified our solution works correctly:\n\nThus, the expression is correct and our calculation of $2a + b = 13$ is valid and verified.\n\nFinal Answer: **13**",

  "ground_truth": "We see that $2z^2 + 13z + 21 = (z + 3)(2z + 7)$, thus $a = 3$ and $b = 7$. Hence, $2a + b = \\boxed{13}.$"
