    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. \n\n**First Impressions:**\nWhen I look at this problem, it reminds me of some algebraic manipulation techniques I've seen before. Specifically, it involves symmetric expressions like \\(z\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{z}\\).\n\nThe expression \\(z^3 + \\frac{1}{z^3}\\) is given, and we want to find \\(z + \\frac{1}{z}\\). I have an inkling that there's a connection between these types of expressions through algebraic identities.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Is there a known identity that connects \\(z^3 + \\frac{1}{z^3}\\) with \\(z + \\frac{1}{z}\\)? \n- I remember something about expressing powers in terms of lower powers using symmetric sum identities. \n- Let's see if expressing one in terms of the other might simplify things.\n\n**Approach:**\n1. **Identity Search:**\n   A common technique for expressions involving powers of \\(z\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{z}\\) is using:\n   \\[\n   (z + \\frac{1}{z})^3 = z^3 + \\frac{1}{z^3} + 3(z + \\frac{1}{z})\n   \\]\n   This looks promising because it combines \\(z^3 + \\frac{1}{z^3}\\) and \\(z + \\frac{1}{z}\\) into a single equation.\n\n2. **Set up the Expression:**\n   Let's set \\(x = z + \\frac{1}{z}\\). Then the identity becomes:\n   \\[\n   x^3 = z^3 + \\frac{1}{z^3} + 3x\n   \\]\n   Given \\(z^3 + \\frac{1}{z^3} = 52\\), substitute this into the equation:\n   \\[\n   x^3 = 52 + 3x\n   \\]\n   or rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   x^3 - 3x - 52 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Cubic Equation:**\n   We need to find the roots of \\(x^3 - 3x - 52 = 0\\).\n\n   - **Checking for Simple Roots:**\n     Let's try some simple values. Often small integers are roots in such problems.\n     - \\(x = 4\\): \\(4^3 - 3 \\times 4 - 52 = 64 - 12 - 52 = 0\\). So, \\(x = 4\\) is a root.\n\n   - **Polynomial Division:**\n     Since \\(x = 4\\) is a root, divide the cubic equation by \\(x - 4\\) to find the other factors:\n     Using synthetic division or polynomial long division:\n     \\[\n     x^3 - 3x - 52 \\div (x - 4) = x^2 + 4x + 13\n     \\]\n\n   - **Solve \\(x^2 + 4x + 13 = 0\\):**\n     Use the quadratic formula:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 13}}{2 \\times 1}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 52}}{2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-36}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 6i}{2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = -2 \\pm 3i\n     \\]\n\n4. **Concluding the Possible Values:**\n   The possible values of \\(z + \\frac{1}{z}\\) are \\(\\boxed{4, -2 + 3i, -2 - 3i}\\).\n\n**Verification:** \n- \\(x = 4\\) satisfies \\(x^3 - 3x - 52 = 0\\), as confirmed earlier.\n- Roots \\(x = -2 + 3i\\) and \\(x = -2 - 3i\\) are complex conjugates, which check out as they also satisfy the original polynomial with the given complex arithmetic.\n\nThese reflections, checks, and computations confirm that the expressions hold, adhering to typical problem-solving techniques used in algebra with complex numbers.",
