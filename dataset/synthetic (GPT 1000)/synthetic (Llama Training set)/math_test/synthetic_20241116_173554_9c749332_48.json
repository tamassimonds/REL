    "working_out": "Sure, let's dive into this problem together and think it through step by step. \n\n---\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I see the problem, the first thing I notice is that it asks for the y-intercept of $Q(x) = P(x)^2$, where $P(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 1$. My mind jumps to the idea that the y-intercept is essentially where $x = 0$, so evaluating $Q(x)$ at $x = 0$ should give the y-intercept. This looks like a good starting point.\n\n**Step 1: Evaluate $P(0)$**\n\nSince $Q(x) = P(x)^2$, first I need to find what $P(0)$ is. Substituting $x = 0$ in $P(x)$, I get:\n\n\\[ P(0) = 4(0)^3 - 2(0)^2 + 7(0) - 1. \\]\n\nThis simplifies pretty easily to:\n\n\\[ P(0) = -1. \\]\n\nOkay, so $P(0)$ is $-1$. This seems pretty straightforward so far.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate $Q(0)$**\n\nNow, to find $Q(0)$, and since $Q(x) = P(x)^2$, I'll square $P(x)$ at $x = 0$:\n\n\\[ Q(0) = (P(0))^2 = (-1)^2. \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ Q(0) = 1. \\]\n\nThat seems right, since the square of $-1$ is indeed $1$. A quick sanity check: is my math here lining up? Yes, $(-1) \\times (-1) = 1$, so my initial approach seems sound.\n\n**Step 3: Reflect on the Result**\n\n- **Is this too simple?**: At first glance, the problem seemed a little too straightforward after evaluating it, but I've followed all necessary steps according to the requirements to find the y-intercept. My calculations seem solid because squaring a small polynomial evaluation is manageable.\n\n- **Quick Check**: Are there any other aspects to consider? Maybe if there was a parameter, I overlooked or over-simplified, but given the setup, squaring the value at zero is mathematically accurate for y-intercept determination as seen.\n\n- **Final Insight**: Actually, this method has turned out to be simpler than expected. This problem might trick someone into thinking there's a more complex trick, but basic principles have applied here directly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe y-intercept of $Q(x)$ is indeed $1$. Everything checks out from my step-by-step approach. I'm confident this is the correct answer after reflecting on each step.",

  "ground_truth": "The y-intercept of a function is the value of the function when $x = 0$. Thus, we want to find the value of $Q(0) = P(0)^2$. Now, $P(0) = 4(0)^3-2(0)^2+7(0)-1=-1$, so it follows that $Q(0) = (-1)^2 = \\boxed{1}$."
