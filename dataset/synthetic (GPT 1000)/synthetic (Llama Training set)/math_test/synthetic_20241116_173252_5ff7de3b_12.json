    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and go through it step by step. We're asked to find the two consecutive integers between which the sum \\(\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50}\\) lies. So, what comes to mind first?\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst thoughts: We're essentially estimating the value of \\(\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50}\\). I need to find a way to approximate these square roots, since they're not perfect squares. But then, I've also seen similar problems before where it's handy to approximate square roots by comparing them to nearby perfect squares.\n\n**Step 2: Approximating Square Roots**\n\nHmm, alright, let's approximate \\(\\sqrt{30}\\) first. The closest perfect squares to 30 are \\(25\\) and \\(36\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{25} = 5\\) and \\(\\sqrt{36} = 6\\), I can infer that \\(5 < \\sqrt{30} < 6\\). \n\nTo get more precise, maybe something like 5.4 might be closer because 30 is slightly more than the middle point (30.5). But let me check that by squaring:\n\n- \\(5.4^2 = 29.16\\) (which is less than 30)\n- Let\u2019s bump it a little.\n- \\(5.5^2 = 30.25\\) (also slightly greater than 30)\n\nSo, \\(\\sqrt{30} \\approx 5.48\\). Maybe round to 5.5 for estimation's sake.\n\nNow, for \\(\\sqrt{50}\\):\n\n50 is between 49 and 64, so \\(\\sqrt{49} = 7\\) and \\(\\sqrt{64} = 8\\), which gives us \\(7 < \\sqrt{50} < 8\\).\n\nLet's nail this down further:\n\n- \\(7.1^2 = 50.41\\)\n- \\(7.05^2 = 49.7025\\)\n\nThus, \\(\\sqrt{50} \\approx 7.07\\).\n\n**Reflection:** My approximations seem reasonable. I'll go with 5.5 for \\(\\sqrt{30}\\) and 7.07 for \\(\\sqrt{50}\\).\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Sum**\n\nNow I sum them up: \\(\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50} \\approx 5.5 + 7.07 = 12.57\\).\n\n**Step 4: Identifying Consecutive Integers**\n\nSo, I'm looking for two integers between which 12.57 would fit. Clearly, it's between 12 and 13.\n\n**Check the Work**\n\nQuick check: Are my approximations sound?\n\n- Estimating \\(\\sqrt{30} \\approx 5.5\\) and \\(\\sqrt{50} \\approx 7.07\\) leads me to \\(5.5 + 7.07 = 12.57\\). Yep, seems right.\n- But could I try another tack to verify? The broad check shows \\(12 \\rightarrow 13\\) consistently stands.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sum \\(\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50}\\) is located between the integers **12 and 13**.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $25<30<36$, we have $5<\\sqrt{30}<6$. We also know that $7^2=49$, so $\\sqrt{50}\\approx7$. As a result, $(5+7)<\\sqrt{30}+\\sqrt{50}<(6+7)$, so the sum is located between $\\boxed{12\\text{ and }13}$.\n\nTo be more precise, $\\sqrt{50}>7$, but we're still able to say that $\\sqrt{30}+\\sqrt{50}<(6+7)$ when we add a slightly greater quantity to the left side since the difference between $6$ and $\\sqrt{30}$ is much greater than the difference between $\\sqrt{50}$ and $7$."
