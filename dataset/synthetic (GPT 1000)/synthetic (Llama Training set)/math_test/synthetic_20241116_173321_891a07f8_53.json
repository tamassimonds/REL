    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem. \n\n**Understanding the Question:**\n1. We need to find the value of \\(30\\%\\) of a number, given that \\(20\\%\\) of the same number is \\(12\\).\n   \nAt first glance, this feels like a problem where we need to set up a relationship using percentages. It seems like something I've solved before involving ratios or simple algebra.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- First, the problem states that \\(20\\%\\) of a number is equal to \\(12\\).\n- We could use the relationship between the percentage and the actual number it represents.\n\n**Strategy Brainstorm:**\n- One possible method is to find out what the original number is by using the fact that \\(20\\%\\) is \\(12\\). Once we know the whole number, we can easily calculate \\(30\\%\\) of it.\n- Another way might be to use a ratio between \\(20\\%\\) and \\(30\\%\\) directly, but let's start with the first approach as it seems more straightforward initially.\n\n**Step-by-Step Thoughts and Calculations:**\n\n1. **Finding the Whole Number:**\n   - If \\(20\\%\\) of a number is \\(12\\), we can set up an equation to find the original number.\n   - Let the original number be \\(x\\).\n   - Translate the statement into an equation: \n     \\[\n     0.20 \\times x = 12\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   - To isolate \\(x\\), divide both sides by \\(0.20\\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{12}{0.20}\n     \\]\n   - Hmm, before I calculate, let's consider if this approach makes sense. Yes, it does\u2014it seems logically correct and straightforward.\n   - Continuing: \n     \\[\n     x = 60\n     \\]\n   - Okay, so the original number is \\(60\\).\n\n3. **Calculating \\(30\\%\\) of the Original Number:**\n   - Now we know the whole number, we need to find \\(30\\%\\) of \\(60\\).\n   - Set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     0.30 \\times 60 = ?\n     \\]\n   - Calculate:\n     \\[\n     = 18\n     \\]\n   - Alright, let\u2019s take a moment to reflect. The steps feel correct, and the arithmetic checks out. \\(30\\%\\) of the original number of \\(60\\) gives us \\(18\\).\n\n4. **Final Reflection:**\n   - Quick check: \\(20\\%\\) of \\(60\\) is indeed \\(12\\), and my calculation method feels natural and logically consistent.\n   - Based on the steps, the solution definitely seems reasonable.\n   - Final answer: \\(30\\%\\) of the number is \\(18\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis approach worked out smoothly. I identified the original number using the given percentage, then calculated the required percentage. Reflecting on the problem-solving process confirmed my solution. It\u2019s always helpful to walk through each step, especially verifying calculations to prevent errors along the way.",
