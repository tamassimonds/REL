    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together and break it down step by step.\n\n### First Thoughts and Understanding the Problem\n\nThe problem asks for the circumference of a circle. The circle's center is given as point \\( P \\), and it passes through another point \\( Q \\). My first instinct tells me that this setup resembles the classic way of defining a circle using its center and a point on the boundary. The distance from the center to a point on the circle is called the radius, and that's key here. The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula \\( C = 2\\pi r \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Distance Formula:** My initial thought is to use the distance formula to find the radius since the radius is the distance from the center \\( P \\) to the point \\( Q \\) on the circle. \n\n2. **Visualizing the Diagram:** I visualize the Cartesian plane and locate the points to ensure there's no misunderstanding about their positions. The coordinates are \\( P(-2, 3) \\) and \\( Q(10, -2) \\).\n\n### Calculating the Radius\n\nTo find the radius, the first step is to apply the distance formula between \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\):\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\nSubstituting in the coordinates:\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{(10 - (-2))^2 + (-2 - 3)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{(10 + 2)^2 + (-5)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{(12)^2 + (5)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{144 + 25}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{169}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = 13\n\\]\nThe radius \\( r \\) is confirmed to be 13. I'll pause here to reflect if that makes sense, and indeed it does because the calculations align correctly.\n\n### Finding the Circumference\n\nWith the radius \\( r = 13 \\), we can now find the circumference of the circle using the formula \\( C = 2\\pi r \\):\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi \\times 13\n\\]\n\\[\nC = 26\\pi\n\\]\n\n### Final Reflection and Conclusion\n\nLet\u2019s double-check every aspect one last time:\n- We determined the radius using correct coordinates and verified with clear steps.\n- The formula to find the circumference is standard and we\u2019ve applied it.\n\nThus, the answer to the problem, the circumference of the circle, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{26\\pi}\n\\] \n\nThis solution is complete, and I feel confident in it. If there were any discrepancies in my thought process, recalculating key steps showed no such errors.",

  "ground_truth": "To find the circumference, we must first find the length of the radius, $PQ$. We can do this by using the distance formula or by noticing that the points $P$, $Q$, and $(-2, -2)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the hypotenuse $PQ$ must equal 13.\n\nNow that we know the radius has length 13, the circumference is $2 \\cdot 13 \\pi = \\boxed{26\\pi}$."
