    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We want to find the negative value of \\( k \\) such that there is exactly one solution to the given system of equations. Here's how I'm thinking we could tackle this:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** \n   We have two equations:\n   - \\( y = 2x^2 + kx + 6 \\) (Quadratic Equation)\n   - \\( y = -x + 4 \\) (Linear Equation)\n\n   We need the graphs of these equations to intersect at exactly one point. I'm immediately reminded of situations where a line is tangent to a parabola. That suggests using the concept of discriminants, but I'll explore some possibilities here to confirm that.\n\n2. **Setting the Equations Equal:**\n   Since both equations equal \\( y \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4\n   \\]\n\n   Rearrange this into standard quadratic form:\n\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + (k + 1)x + 2 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Requirement for One Solution:**\n   For the quadratic equation \\( 2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 = 0 \\) to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   b^2 - 4ac\n   \\]\n\n   Setting the discriminant to zero for one solution:\n\n   \\[\n   (k+1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( k \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   (k+1)^2 - 16 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   (k+1)^2 = 16\n   \\]\n\n   Take the square root of both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   k+1 = \\pm 4\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, we have two potential solutions for \\( k \\):\n\n   - \\( k + 1 = 4 \\Rightarrow k = 3 \\)\n   - \\( k + 1 = -4 \\Rightarrow k = -5 \\)\n\n5. **Choosing the Correct Value of \\( k \\):**\n   We are asked for the negative value of \\( k\\). Therefore, the correct solution is:\n\n   \\[\n   k = -5\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   Let's verify by plugging \\( k = -5 \\) back into our quadratic equation to ensure a single intersection point:\n\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + (-5 + 1)x + 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2x^2 - 4x + 2 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   Check the discriminant:\n\n   \\[\n   (-4)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 16 - 16 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   The discriminant is zero, confirming that for \\( k = -5 \\), there's exactly one solution.\n\nSo, going through this step-by-step, we conclude that the negative value of \\( k \\) for which there is exactly one solution to the system is \\( \\boxed{-5} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Setting the two expressions for $y$ equal to each other, it follows that $2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4$. Re-arranging, $2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 = 0$. For there to be exactly one solution for $x$, then the discriminant of the given quadratic must be equal to zero. Thus, $(k+1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = (k+1)^2 - 16 = 0$, so $k+1 = \\pm 4$. Taking the negative value, $k = \\boxed{-5}$."
