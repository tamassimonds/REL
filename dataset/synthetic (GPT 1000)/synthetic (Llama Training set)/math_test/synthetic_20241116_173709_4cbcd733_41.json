    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the problem\n\nFirst, this problem involves modifying a square into an octagon by cutting off corners of the square. Initially, the sides of the square are 10 inches, and we cut congruent isosceles right triangles from each corner.\n\nThe main goal is to find the length of each side of the resulting octagon. Since these triangles are isosceles right triangles, the legs of the triangles will be equal, and these will be cut from the corners of the square. Each side of the octagon will then be formed by the remaining parts of each square's side minus two legs of these triangles.\n\n### Step 2: Drawing the problem\n\nIt might be helpful to draw this out or visualize it: \n\n1. We start with a square.\n2. At each corner of the square, an isosceles right triangle is removed.\n3. This results in an octagon with equal-length sides.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the side length of the octagon\n\nThe key realization here is that when we cut out congruent isosceles right triangles, the legs of each triangle are equal, let\u2019s denote this as \\( x \\). This means for each side of the square, an \\( x \\) is removed from each end, so what's left as part of the octagon is:\n\n\\[ 10 - 2x \\] \n\n### Step 4: Recognize the octagon structure\n\nVisually, you can picture that each side of the octagon is equal, and due to symmetry, we can assume that the equating side of the octagon to the remaining segments of the square's sides must involve some symmetry with the 45-degree angles of isosceles right triangles.\n\n### Step 5: Establishing equations and solving\n\nThe length of the side of the octagon should equal the length of the diagonal of the triangles we remove, which is \\( x\\sqrt{2} \\). Therefore the equation for one side of the octagon is:\n\n\\[ 10 - 2x = x\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nLet's solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 10 - 2x = x\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\\[ 10 = x\\sqrt{2} + 2x \\]\n\\[ 10 = x(\\sqrt{2} + 2) \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2} + 2} \\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplifying using rationalization\n\nNow, rationalizing the denominator:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2} + 2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 2}{\\sqrt{2} - 2} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{10(\\sqrt{2} - 2)}{(\\sqrt{2})^2 - 2^2} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{10(\\sqrt{2} - 2)}{2 - 4} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{10(\\sqrt{2} - 2)}{-2} \\]\n\\[ x = -5(\\sqrt{2} - 2) \\]\n\\[ x = -5\\sqrt{2} + 10 \\]\n\n### Step 7: Determine the octagon side\n\nSubstituting back to find the side \\( s \\) of the octagon, which equals \\( 10 - 2x \\): \n\n\\[  s = 10 - 2(-5\\sqrt{2} + 10) \\]\n\\[  s = 10 + 10\\sqrt{2} - 20 \\]\n\\[  s = 10\\sqrt{2} - 10 \\]\n\nCalculate the numerical value:\n\n\\[ 10\\sqrt{2} \\approx 14.14\\]\n\\[ s \\approx 14.14 - 10 \\]\n\\[ s \\approx 4.14 \\]\n\nThus, the length of one side of the octagon is approximately \\( \\boxed{4.14} \\) inches. \n\n### Reflection\n\nI've double-checked by considering the symmetry of the cut-off triangles and using consistent geometric/arithmetical logic. It seems correct to describe it as the result of deducting equal-length triangle edges from each square side and rationalizing efficiently. That's consistent with other typical problems of this nature.",
