    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem and take it step by step. \n\nFirst thoughts: \n\nThe question asks: For what value of \\( x \\) will \\(\\frac{2x-1}{2x+2}\\) and \\(\\frac{x-3}{x-1}\\) be equal? \n\nI recognize this as a problem involving rational expressions. My goal is to find an \\( x \\) such that the two expressions are equal. At first glance, this looks like a problem of solving an equation since we're dealing with rational expressions, and I need to find common ground for them to be equal.\n\n#### Brainstorming and strategy:\n\n1. **Set them equal to each other**: This is the immediate strategy that comes to mind. Set \\(\\frac{2x-1}{2x+2} = \\frac{x-3}{x-1}\\) and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Cross-multiply**: I can cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators. That would give me a polynomial equation to solve.\n\n3. **Check domain restrictions**: With rational expressions, I need to be wary of values that make the denominators zero.\n\n4. **Simplify if possible**: Sometimes, expressions can surprisingly simplify or factor to make the problem easier.\n\nLet's start by setting the expressions equal and solving.\n\n### Step 1: Set the expressions equal\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x-1}{2x+2} = \\frac{x-3}{x-1}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Cross-multiply\n\nCross-multiplying to eliminate fractions:\n\n\\[\n(2x-1)(x-1) = (x-3)(2x+2)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Expand both sides\n\nFirst, expand \\((2x-1)(x-1)\\):\n\n\\[\n2x \\cdot x - 2x \\cdot 1 - 1 \\cdot x + 1 = 2x^2 - 2x - x + 1 = 2x^2 - 3x + 1\n\\]\n\nNow, expanding \\((x-3)(2x+2)\\):\n\n\\[\nx \\cdot 2x + x \\cdot 2 - 3 \\cdot 2x - 3 \\cdot 2 = 2x^2 + 2x - 6x - 6 = 2x^2 - 4x - 6\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Set expanded equations equal\n\nNow, equate the two expanded sides:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 3x + 1 = 2x^2 - 4x - 6\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplify the equation\n\nSubtract \\(2x^2\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-3x + 1 = -4x - 6\n\\]\n\nAdd \\(4x\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\nx + 1 = -6\n\\]\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = -7\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Verify and check restrictions\n\nLet's quickly check if \\( x = -7 \\) leads to division by zero in either original expression:\n\n- In \\(\\frac{2x-1}{2x+2}\\), substituting \\(x = -7\\) gives us \\(\\frac{-15}{-12}\\), which is valid as the denominator is not zero.\n- In \\(\\frac{x-3}{x-1}\\), substituting \\(x = -7\\) gives us \\(\\frac{-10}{-8}\\), which is valid as the denominator is not zero.\n\nBoth expressions are valid at \\( x = -7 \\), and they simplify to the same value upon substitution.\n\n#### Final reflection:\n\nThis approach using equation solving and cross-multiplication worked. I initially worried about zero denominators, but our final solution is in a safe range. The critical step was correctly setting up and solving the resulting linear equation. Everything checks out logically and mathematically.\n\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the original equation is \\( \\boxed{-7} \\).",
