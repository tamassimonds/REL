    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, exploring different strategies and keeping track of our thoughts as we go.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see the expression \\(x^4 + x^3y + x^2y^2 + xy^3 + y^4\\) with given values \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 4\\), I'm thinking this looks like a straightforward substitution problem where the powers and terms might make it a bit complex in terms of calculations. However, the structure doesn't suggest any particularly easy tricks like factoring or symmetrical insights because of the mixed terms.\n\n### Strategy Brainstorm\n\n1. **Substitution and Computation**: The most direct approach is to substitute \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 4\\) into the expression and compute each term separately. This is straightforward, although it might be a bit tedious.\n   \n2. **Recognizing Patterns**: I quickly scanned for any recognizable patterns or simplifications, perhaps treating it as a sum of symmetric polynomials, but didn't see any obvious simplifications. The terms don't offer easy grouping or identities like the sum of two squares or binomials.\n\n3. **Order of Calculation**: Should I compute each term separately and then sum them up, or is there a more efficient way to group the calculations to save steps?\n\nWith these in mind, let's proceed with the direct computation since that seems most viable here.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n#### Substitution:\n1. **Calculate \\(x^4\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   x^4 = 5^4\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = 625\n   \\]\n\n   Checking: I mentally verified \\(5^4\\) as \\( (5^2)^2 = 25^2 = 625\\), which seems right.\n\n2. **Calculate \\(x^3y\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   x^3y = 5^3 \\times 4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 125 \\times 4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 500\n   \\]\n\n   Quick check: \\(125 \\times 4\\) is \\(100 \\times 4 + 25 \\times 4 = 400 + 100 = 500\\). Looks correct.\n\n3. **Calculate \\(x^2y^2\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   x^2y^2 = 5^2 \\times 4^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 25 \\times 16\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 400\n   \\]\n\n   Double checking: \\(16 \\times 25 = 400\\). Yes, it works since \\(16\\) times \\(20 = 320\\) and \\(16\\) times \\(5 = 80\\), adding these gives \\(400\\).\n\n4. **Calculate \\(xy^3\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   xy^3 = 5 \\times 4^3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 5 \\times 64\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 320\n   \\]\n\n   Reflecting: \\(5 \\times 64 = 320\\). I verified with \\(5\\) times \\(60 = 300\\) and \\(5\\) times \\(4 = 20\\). Adding these gives \\(320\\). Seems good.\n\n5. **Calculate \\(y^4\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   y^4 = 4^4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 256\n   \\]\n\n   Verifying: \\(4^4 = (4^2)^2 = 16^2 = 256\\). That checks out.\n\n#### Sum the Calculated Terms\nNow to sum everything up:\n\n- \\(625 + 500 + 400 + 320 + 256\\)\n\nLet's break this down carefully:\n\n- \\(625 + 500 = 1125\\)\n- \\(1125 + 400 = 1525\\)\n- \\(1525 + 320 = 1845\\)\n- \\(1845 + 256 = 2101\\)\n\n### Final Reflection\n\nAfter computing each term and adding them up, we get a final result of \\(2101\\). That seems reasonable considering the sizes of the terms. I've checked intermediate steps and double-checked my arithmetic, which all seem to be correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThrough this detailed process of substitution and computation, I've arrived at the conclusion that the value of the expression when \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 4\\) is \\(\\boxed{2101}\\). Overall, this approach involved direct computation, careful verification of calculations, and meticulous aggregation of results.",

Since $x - y \\not = 0$, we can write $$x^4 + x^3y + x^2y^2 + xy^3 + y^4 = \\frac{(x-y)(x^4 + x^3y + x^2y^2 + xy^3 + y^4)}{x-y} = \\frac{x^5-y^5}{x-y}.$$Plugging in $x = 5$ and $y = 4$, we get $$\\frac{5^5 - 4^5}{5-4} = 3125 - 1024 = \\boxed{2101}.$$"
