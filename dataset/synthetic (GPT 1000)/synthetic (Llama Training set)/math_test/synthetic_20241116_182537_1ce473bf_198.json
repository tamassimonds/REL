    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, I see that we need to find the number of different possible rational roots for the given polynomial \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\) with integer coefficients. Knowing that the coefficients are integers reminds me of the Rational Root Theorem, which might be useful here.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that any rational root, expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is such that \\(p\\) divides the constant term and \\(q\\) divides the leading coefficient. In this polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2.\n\n**1. Exploring with the Rational Root Theorem:**\n\nLet's brainstorm and list what this theorem implies for our polynomial:\n\n- The potential values for \\(p\\), the factors of the constant term 1, are \\(\\pm1\\).\n- The potential values for \\(q\\), the factors of the leading coefficient 2, are \\(\\pm1\\) and \\(\\pm2\\).\n\nFrom the possible values of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), the possible rational roots \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) can be:\n\n- \\(\\pm \\frac{1}{1} = \\pm 1\\)\n- \\(\\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nThis results in a total of 4 possible rational roots: \\(1, -1, \\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n**2. Validating the Approaches:**\n\nNow I'm going to reflect on this and make sure I haven't missed anything:\n\n- **Rational Root Theorem Check:** This looks correct. The theorem indeed states that rational roots are of the form \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) divides the constant term, and \\(q\\) divides the leading coefficient. We correctly identified \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n- **No Need for Other Strategies:** Since the polynomial coefficients are integers, and we're focusing on rational roots, the Rational Root Theorem seems suitable without the need for deeper exploration methods like factoring or graphing.\n\n**3. Final Thoughts and Verification:**\n\nLet's quickly verify if each potential root makes sense. Substitute these values into the polynomial to see if they satisfy the equation. However, since it is a theoretical exercise to find *possible* rational roots rather than actual roots, the step of substitution often just checks if zero can be obtained using any integer, which isn't strictly necessary here unless further validation is required by task conditions.\n\nNow I may reflect again: The overall thought process confirms the application of the Rational Root Theorem was necessary and direct. Realizing that no irrational root condition applies here and only different possibilities for rational roots are required, all calculations seem logical and complete.\n\nIn conclusion, the number of different possible rational roots of this polynomial is 4: \\(1, -1, \\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThis concludes the exploration and solution using step-by-step reflective analysis and validation in line with polynomial root-finding strategies.",
