    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together. It's about finding how many zeroes there are in the product \\((9.2 \\times 10^2)(8 \\times 10^6)\\). I want to carefully consider each step and work through the arithmetic while thinking about the properties of numbers and exponents.\n\n### First Impressions\n\nOkay, looking at this question, it seems familiar because it's asking about zeroes in a product of numbers expressed in scientific notation. Usually, the power of 10 determines the number of trailing zeroes in a number \u2013 that's my first thought. So maybe there\u2019s a connection there I should be exploring.\n\n### Breaking Down the Problem\n\n1. **Understanding the Numbers**: \n\n    - The two numbers we're multiplying are \\(9.2 \\times 10^2\\) and \\(8 \\times 10^6\\). These are in scientific notation, which makes it easier to work with both large and small numbers by breaking them into a base and an exponent.\n\n2. **Exploring Strategies**:\n\n    - **Direct Multiplication**: One strategy is to calculate the product directly by multiplying the bases and then combining the exponents. \n\n    - **Number of Zeroes**: I suspect that the key to determining the number of zeroes in the final product might be related to the powers of ten, since those contribute zeroes to the number in standard form.\n\n### Calculations\n\n3. **Multiply the Bases**: I\u2019ll multiply the non-exponent parts first.\n\n    \\[\n    9.2 \\times 8 = 73.6\n    \\]\n\n    Okay, so we get 73.6 from multiplying the bases.\n\n4. **Combine the Exponents**: When multiplying terms in scientific notation, you add the exponents.\n\n    \\[\n    10^2 \\times 10^6 = 10^{2+6} = 10^8\n    \\]\n\n    This gives us \\(10^8\\), which implies moving the decimal point 8 places to the right.\n\n5. **Formulate the Product**:\n\n    The product of the numbers is:\n\n    \\[\n    73.6 \\times 10^8\n    \\]\n\n6. **Convert to Standard Form**:\n\n    To put \\(73.6 \\times 10^8\\) into standard form:\n\n    - I move the decimal point in 73.6 eight places to the right, which yields:\n    \\[\n    7360000000\n    \\]\n\n    This is \\(7,360,000,000\\).\n\n### Verifying and Reflecting\n\n7. **Counting Zeroes**: \n\n    There are two zeroes after the 36, and six more zeroes after the 7 and the 3, in total:\n    - **Six zeroes** contributed by \\(10^8\\) since \\(10^8\\) represents 100,000,000, which itself has 8 zeroes, but the part \\(0.36 \\times 10^2\\) partially uses up some of those places.\n\n8. **Rethink if Needed**:\n\n    I believe I initially thought \\(10^8\\) would contribute 8 zeroes, forgetting that multiplication with 73.6 adjusts the decimal directly before being influenced by the \\(10^8\\). \n\n9. **Conclusion**: \n\n    The result \\(7,360,000,000\\) conventionally has 6 trailing zeroes added by \\(10^8\\) after accounting for the number displacement by 73.6 partially using the exponent. I think answering the number of zeroes in this final number accurately means saying it has 6 zeroes. \n\nIn final analysis, the product \\(73.6 \\times 10^8\\) brings about 6 trailing zeroes from the combined exponent and positioning of numerals in the conversion to standard form.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's take another look at this step by step to figure out the correct number of zeroes in the product \\((9.2 \\times 10^2)(8 \\times 10^6)\\).\n\n### Reassessing the Strategy\n\nAt first glance, it seemed like the number of trailing zeroes would directly correspond to the exponent in the power of ten component, but there\u2019s more nuance because of the decimal point in \\(73.6\\). Let\u2019s carefully evaluate it again.\n\n### Examining the Calculations\n\nIn my previous solution, I multiplied the bases:\n\n\\[ 9.2 \\times 8 = 73.6 \\]\n\nThen, I combined the exponents:\n\n\\[ 10^2 \\times 10^6 = 10^{2+6} = 10^8 \\]\n\nThis multiplication results in:\n\n\\[ 73.6 \\times 10^8 \\]\n\n### Converting to Standard Form\n\nTo convert this into standard form, I should move the decimal place in \\(73.6\\) eight places to the right due to \\(10^8\\):\n\n1. **Move the Decimal in 73.6:**\n\n   - Moving past the 6 provides the whole number 736 with zero decimal places.\n   - Moving the decimal 7 more places introduces 7 trailing zeroes.\n\nThus, the number becomes:\n\n\\[ 7,360,000,000 \\]\n\n### Reflecting and Verifying\n\nBy moving the decimal point as instructed by \\(10^8\\), after accounting for the initial decimal position in 73.6, we align the number at \\(7,360,000,000\\), which has 7 zeroes trailing after the digit '3'.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo, the product \\((9.2 \\times 10^2)(8 \\times 10^6)\\) indeed results in a number, \\(7,360,000,000\\), which has \\(\\boxed{7}\\) zeroes in its standard form. This correction clarifies the roles of the decimal point and the power of ten, providing us the accurate count.",
