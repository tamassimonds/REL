    "working_out": "### Initial Thoughts\n\nOkay, let's understand the problem first. Mary wants to visit three out of the five tourist locations in Italy, and the order doesn't matter. This immediately makes me think of a combinations problem, rather than permutations, since ordering isn't important. \n\n---\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n#### Strategy 1: Simple Counting\n\nOne way to approach this is by listing all potential combinations. If I imagine five locations as A, B, C, D, E, we'd be looking for combinations like ABC, ABD, ABE, etc. This is a small enough set that listing could be possible, but as I think more, there could be a simpler way using combinations formula.\n\n#### Strategy 2: Combinations Formula\n\nThis reminds me of the combinations formula: \\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose. In this case, \\( n = 5 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\).\n\nLet's proceed and calculate the combinations using this formula, as this seems more efficient than listing.\n\n---\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe formula we'd use is:\n\n\\[ C(5, 3) = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} \\]\n\nThis expands to:\n\n\\[ C(5, 3) = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3!}{3! \\times 2 \\times 1} \\]\n\nThe \\(3!\\) in the numerator and the denominator cancel each other out:\n\n\\[ C(5, 3) = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} \\]\n\nNow, let's simplify:\n\n\\[ C(5, 3) = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\]\n\n---\n\n### Reflection and Validation\n\nI got 10 as the number of ways Mary can choose 3 locations out of 5. To verify, I'll consider if the math makes sense:\n\n- **Quick Check using Simple Counting**: Consider a smaller example, choosing 2 out of 3 locations. Using the formula: \\( C(3, 2) = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{2 \\times 1} = 3 \\). Listing those: AB, AC, and BC checks out. This validates that the formula works as expected for this kind of problem.\n  \n- **Is the magnitude reasonable?** With only 5 locations and choosing 3, having 10 ways seems plausible without being too high or low.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and cross-validating with a smaller example, I'm confident that \\( \\text{Mary has 10 different ways to choose 3 locations out of 5} \\). The combinations formula was the right approach here given the problem constraints. This feels good and logical, and I'm satisfied with this solution.",
