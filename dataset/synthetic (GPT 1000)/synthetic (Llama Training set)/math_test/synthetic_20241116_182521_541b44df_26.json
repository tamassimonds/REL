    "working_out": "Alright, let's roll up our sleeves and dig into this problem. We've got a function \\( f(x) = \\frac{3x-2}{x-2} \\) and we need to find the sum \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\). Let's take it step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nLooking at the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{3x-2}{x-2} \\), my first instinctive thought is: Is there anything tricky going on with the denominator? It's possible for the denominator to create undefined points, and we're asked to evaluate the function at specific values, so we should keep an eye out for any \\( x \\neq 2 \\).\n\n**Let's think aloud:**\n\n- **Understanding the Function:** Right away, I notice \\( x = 2 \\) would make the denominator zero, so \\( f \\) is not defined at \\( x = 2 \\). Fair enough, but this doesn\u2019t impact the specific values \\( -2, -1, \\) and \\( 0 \\).\n\n- **Exploration Strategy:** \n  - Evaluate \\( f(x) \\) directly at the given points.\n  - Add them together.\n\nI think the most straightforward way is just to substitute these \\( x \\) values into the function individually and see what happens.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluating \\( f(-2) \\)\n\nOkay, let's plug in \\( x = -2 \\):\n\n\\[\nf(-2) = \\frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} \n\\]\n\n- **Calculating the numerator:** \\( 3(-2) - 2 = -6 - 2 = -8 \\)\n- **Calculating the denominator:** \\( -2 - 2 = -4 \\)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\nf(-2) = \\frac{-8}{-4} = 2\n\\]\n\nThat wasn't too bad. I\u2019ll note it down.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluating \\( f(-1) \\)\n\nNext, substitute \\( x = -1 \\):\n\n\\[\nf(-1) = \\frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2}\n\\]\n\n- **Numerator:** \\( 3(-1) - 2 = -3 - 2 = -5 \\)\n- **Denominator:** \\( -1 - 2 = -3 \\)\n\nSo we have:\n\n\\[\nf(-1) = \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3}\n\\]\n\nOoh, a fraction! Makes me cautious about arithmetic errors. Let me just double-check: Yep, it seems fine.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluating \\( f(0) \\)\n\nFinally, consider \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nf(0) = \\frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} \n\\]\n\n- **Numerator:** \\( 3(0) - 2 = -2 \\)\n- **Denominator:** \\( 0 - 2 = -2 \\)\n\n\\[\nf(0) = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Summing it All Up\n\nNow, we need the sum \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + \\frac{5}{3} + 1 \\).\n\n**To add these, convert to a common denominator:**\n\n1. Convert \\(2\\) to a fraction: \\( \\frac{6}{3} \\)\n2. Convert \\(1\\) to a fraction: \\( \\frac{3}{3} \\)\n\nThus the sum becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{3} + \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \\frac{14}{3}\n\\]\n\nThe answer seems reasonable. Quickly revisiting the computations to ensure no arithmetic mistakes exist, everything looks good.\n\n---\n\n### Reflection\n\nI figured out correct approaches by just evaluating the function values and summing them immediately. No red flags except confirming fractions and simple arithmetic. I'm convinced based on the deriving steps, the arithmetic, and the logical process that \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = \\frac{14}{3} \\) is indeed correct.\n\n---\n\nSo, the final answer is \\(\\frac{14}{3}\\). Happy with this approach and outcome!",
