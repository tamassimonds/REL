    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. First, I'm going to break down what the question is actually asking. It looks like we're dealing with some modular arithmetic.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question\n\nWe have:\n- An integer \\( k \\) which can be any positive integer less than 6. So \\( k \\) can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n- The problem is asking how many values of \\( k \\) make the equation \\( 3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6} \\) unsolvable for \\( x \\).\n\nWhat does that mean? It means that when we solve this, we won't find any integer \\( x \\) that fits the equation when reduced modulo 6. \n\n### Step 2: Investigate the Equation\n\nThe congruence \\( 3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6} \\) means that when we multiply 3 by some integer \\( x \\) and divide by 6, the remainder should be \\( k \\).\n\nLet's try some values of \\( x \\) and see what sort of residues we get when we calculate \\( 3x \\mod 6 \\).\n\nHow to do this? It's usually helpful to test a few values of \\( x \\):\n\n**Testing values of \\( x \\):**\n\n- For \\( x = 0 \\), \\( 3 \\times 0 = 0 \\), so \\( 3x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6} \\).\n- For \\( x = 1 \\), \\( 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\), so \\( 3x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\).\n- For \\( x = 2 \\), \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6} \\).\n- For \\( x = 3 \\), \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\).\n- For \\( x = 4 \\), \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6} \\).\n- For \\( x = 5 \\), \\( 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\).\n\nLet's see if a pattern emerges for the residues. \n\nOh! I notice something. The possible residues \\( 3x \\mod 6 \\) are either 0 or 3. The residues repeat because \\( 3 \\) and \\( 6 \\) are not coprime (they share a common factor, 3).\n\n### Step 3: Determine Which \\( k \\) are Unsolvable\n\nNow, let's consider which values of \\( k \\) aren't represented in the residues {0, 3}:\n\n- \\( k = 1 \\): Not possible\n- \\( k = 2 \\): Not possible\n- \\( k = 3 \\): Possible\n- \\( k = 4 \\): Not possible\n- \\( k = 5 \\): Not possible\n\n### Step 4: Count the Unsolvable Values\n\nFrom the above, the values of \\( k \\) that aren't possible when solving \\( 3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6} \\) are 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n\nLet's count them: 1, 2, 4, and 5 total four values.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter reflecting on the problem and double-checking my steps, the number of values \\( k \\) can take on such that \\( 3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6} \\) has no solutions in \\( x \\) is 4. \n\nThis conclusion makes sense given the repeated pattern of residues when we multiply by 3 up to modulo 6. The important insight was the realization that the residues form a limited set due to shared factors between 3 and 6.",

  "ground_truth": "Note that the left-hand side is divisible by 3. Therefore, since 3 divides 6, the left-hand side will be equivalent to a multiple of 3. Therefore, if $k$ were to be 1, 2, 4, or 5, then the given congruence would have no solutions. On the other hand, if $k=0$ or $k=3$, then $x=0$ and $x=1$ (respectively) satisfy the given congruence. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ values of $k$ such that $3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6}$ has no solutions."
