What result should Eric obtain if $1$ kilowatt is equivalent to $1.36$ horsepower? (You may use a calculator on this problem; answer to the nearest kilowatt.)",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem methodically. First, I'm trying to understand what the question is asking. Eric wants to convert the horsepower of his car engine to kilowatts. This task involves a unit conversion, which is a fairly common problem in physics and engineering.\n\nInitial Thoughts:\n- I've done conversions like this many times before. It's about multiplying or dividing by the conversion factor.\n- The question provides a conversion factor: 1 kilowatt equals 1.36 horsepower.\n- Oh, right! I need to convert from horsepower to kilowatts, not the other way around. So I'll need to use the conversion factor properly.\n\nThis looks straightforward, but let's brainstorm:\n- I could divide the horsepower by the conversion factor to get kilowatts, or...\n- I could try to check if there's a more intuitive method, but with the direct conversion factor given, using it seems the most sensible.\n\nAlright, let's go with the first approach:\n1. **Conversion factor**: 1 kilowatt = 1.36 horsepower. But, since I'm going the other way (horsepower to kilowatts), it makes sense to divide rather than multiply.\n   \n2. **Calculate kilowatts**:\n   - Eric's car has 500 horsepower.\n   - To find kilowatts: \\( \\text{kilowatts} = \\frac{\\text{horsepower}}{\\text{conversion factor}} \\).\n   - So, \\(\\text{kilowatts} = \\frac{500}{1.36}\\).\n\nNow, let's compute that:\n- Using a calculator: \\( \\frac{500}{1.36} \\approx 367.647 \\).\n\nCheck this result:\n- Hmm, let's quickly reflect on whether this makes sense. Since 1 horsepower is about 0.735 kW (which is essentially \\(1 \\div 1.36\\)), multiplying this by 500 should bring it close to 368.\n- Doing a rough check: 1 horsepower \u2248 0.735 kW, so 500 \\(\\times\\) 0.735 \u2248 367.5, which is similar to what we calculated.\n\nFeeling good about this number, but let me reflect for a moment... Does converting like this make sense?\n- Yes! Dividing by the conversion factor aligns with how conversions work: higher horsepower means fewer kilowatts when considering the value in kilowatts must be more for less power than equivalent horsepower.\n\nFinal result to the nearest kilowatt:\n- Since 367.647 rounds to 368, the engine generates about 368 kilowatts.\n\nI'm comfortable with my calculations and reasoning. The conversion process seems solid, and all the numbers align with expectations logically based on the conversion values. This seems like the correct approach.",
