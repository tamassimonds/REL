    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem. The question asks us to find another number whose square is 225, acknowledging that the square of 15 is already 225. I'm going to tackle this in a step-by-step manner, articulating my thoughts as I go.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Impression**\n\nOkay, so we know that the square of 15 is 225. I need to find another number, not 15, that when squared also equals 225. This almost immediately reminds me that there are usually two numbers for which squaring gives the same result: a positive and a negative version of the same number because \\((-15)^2\\) is the same as \\(15^2\\).\n\n**Step 2: Exploration**\n\nLet me think about why this is true. Squaring is an operation that 'loses' information about the sign, squaring always gives a positive result or zero. So, both \\(15\\) and \\(-15\\) squared will give me 225 (since \\(-15 \\times -15 = 225\\)). \n\n**Wait, let me confirm this:**\n\\[ (-15) \\times (-15) = 225 \\]\n\nOkay, doing that multiplication quickly in my head:\n- \\(-15\\) times \\(-15\\) gives 225.\n- Yes, that's right because multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive number, and the numerical product 15 times 15 is indeed 225.\n\n**Step 3: Consider Edge Cases**\n\nIs there any possibility of missing anything like a fraction or irrational number solution? In this case, since we are strictly dealing with perfect squares and since 225 is a result of integer squaring, there are no additional possible integer solutions beyond 15 and -15.\n\n**Step 4: Verifying the Answer**\n\nThe thought should be straightforward, but I want to consider whether my logic might have missed any steps. Since the square root function returns the absolute value, both 15 and -15 are inadvertently discussed when talking about possible integers. \n\nHere's another quick check:\n- By definition, if \\(x^2 = 225\\), then \\(x\\) could be 15 or -15. Rewriting, \\(\\pm x = 15\\): this means \\(x = 15\\) or \\(-15\\).\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nI have identified two potential integer solutions. The valid numbers whose square give us 225 are \\(15\\) and \\(-15\\). It makes sense mathematically since squaring either positive or negative value results in the same positive product.\n\nReflecting on this journey, I confirmed my calculations and logic backed by several checks. Walking through both algebraically and intuitively reassures that this solution is right - feeling confident that the analysis has been thorough without over-simplifying or over-complicating it.\n\nTo sum up, the other number whose square is 225 is \\(-15\\).",
