    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about the number of games in a round-robin tournament. I've encountered round-robin concepts before, but let's break it down using the given formula and see where that leads us. \n\n---\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see this, my mind jumps to the fact that in a round-robin tournament, each team plays against every other team exactly once. That makes sense for why the formula \\((n^2-n)/2\\) calculates the total number of games: because for \\(n\\) teams, each team plays \\(n-1\\) games, but then we must divide by 2 to avoid double-counting every game.\n\nThe problem states that 55 games were played, and we need to figure out how many teams participated, meaning we need to solve for \\(n\\) in the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n^2 - n}{2} = 55\n\\]\n\nHmm, I need to solve for \\(n\\). This looks like it leads to a quadratic equation, but before diving in, let's consider a few possibilities.\n\n---\n\n### Brainstorming\n\n**Option 1: Plug and Chug**  \nI could start testing small values of \\(n\\) and incrementally see when the formula equals 55. This is straightforward for small \\(n\\).\n\n**Option 2: Algebraic Manipulation**  \nUse algebra to isolate \\(n\\), knowing that this eventually involves solving a quadratic. Let's see where this takes us and if it's a manageable route.\n\n---\n\n### Testing Small Values (Plug and Chug)\n\nLet's begin by testing some small integers:\n\n- \\(n = 4\\): \\(\\frac{4^2 - 4}{2} = \\frac{16 - 4}{2} = 6\\) games\n- \\(n = 5\\): \\(\\frac{5^2 - 5}{2} = \\frac{25 - 5}{2} = 10\\) games\n- \\(n = 6\\): \\(\\frac{6^2 - 6}{2} = \\frac{36 - 6}{2} = 15\\) games\n- \\(n = 10\\): \\(\\frac{10^2 - 10}{2} = \\frac{100 - 10}{2} = 45\\) games\n- \\(n = 11\\): \\(\\frac{11^2 - 11}{2} = \\frac{121 - 11}{2} = 55\\) games\n\n**Ah-ha!** For \\(n = 11\\), we have 55 games, which matches perfectly. But let's double-check to ensure I didn't rush through it.\n\n---\n\n### Verification\n\nTo verify this answer without ambiguity, let's solve the equation step-by-step algebraically.\n\nStarting from:\n\\[\n\\frac{n^2 - n}{2} = 55\n\\]\n\n1. Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:\n   \\[\n   n^2 - n = 110\n   \\]\n\n2. Rearrange into standard quadratic form:\n   \\[\n   n^2 - n - 110 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. This can be solved with the quadratic formula \\(n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -1\\), and \\(c = -110\\).\n\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-110)}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 440}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{441}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{1 \\pm 21}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the possible values for \\(n\\):\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{1 + 21}{2} = 11 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = \\frac{1 - 21}{2} = -10\n   \\]\n\nSince \\(n\\) must be positive, \\(n = 11\\) is the only valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHence, there are 11 teams in this round-robin tournament that led to 55 games being played. This matches my intuition and checks out with the algebra, so I feel confident in this answer.",

  "ground_truth": "There are two ways to do this quickly: Set $\\frac{n^2-n}{2} = 55$, multiply both sides by 2, so that you have $n^2 - n = 110$.  Then, quickly notice that $n = 11$ is the only number conceivably close enough such that that equation will work (namely, $n = 10$ is too small, and $n = 12$ is too big, since 144 is way greater than 110.)  If you do the problem in this manner, you should do it all in your head so as to be able to do it more quickly (and you gain nothing from writing it out).\n\nThe other way is to quickly factor the numerator to $n(n-1)$, and once again multiply both sides by 2.  Then, you'll have $n(n-1) = 110$, from which you should recognize that both 10 and 11 are factors, from which you get $n = \\boxed{11}$.\n\nWe can also solve this as a quadratic equation. $n(n-1) = 110$ becomes $n^2 - n - 110 = 0$. Factoring, we find that $(n - 11)(n + 10) = 0.$ This gives us $n = 11$ or $n = -10,$ but $n$ must be positive, so $n = \\boxed{11}$."
