    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem. We need to find the value of \\(K\\) such that a line parallel to the given line passes through the point \\((0, K)\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nFirst, let's break down what the problem is asking:\n\n- We have a line given by the equation \\(3x - 7y = 65\\).\n- We're looking for a line parallel to this that passes through the points \\((7, 4)\\) and \\((0, K)\\).\n- We need to find the value of \\(K\\).\n\nWhen I think about parallel lines, I recall that they must have the same slope. So, my task is to find the slope of the given line and ensure the line passing through \\((7, 4)\\) and \\((0, K)\\) has the same slope.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Slope of the Given Line\n\nLet's start by finding the slope of the line \\(3x - 7y = 65\\):\n\n1. The general form of a line is \\(Ax + By = C\\). To find the slope, I need to rearrange this into the slope-intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope.\n   \n2. Rearrange the equation \\(3x - 7y = 65\\) to solve for \\(y\\):\n\n   \\[\n   -7y = -3x + 65\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{3}{7}x - \\frac{65}{7}\n   \\]\n\n   So, the slope \\(m\\) of the given line is \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Use the Slope to Find K\n\nNow, the target line, which is parallel to the given line, must also have a slope of \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\).\n\n1. Let's use the points \\((7, 4)\\) and \\((0, K)\\) with the slope formula \\(m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\). For these points, we can set:\n\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{K - 4}{0 - 7} = \\frac{K - 4}{-7}\n   \\]\n\n   Since we know the slope \\(m = \\frac{3}{7}\\), we set the equations equal:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{K - 4}{-7} = \\frac{3}{7}\n   \\]\n\n2. Now, solve for \\(K\\):\n\n   \\[\n   K - 4 = -3\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   K = 1\n   \\]\n\nOkay, let's pause. Is this right? Let me double-check. Each step looks solid: I've rearranged the given line correctly, calculated the slope, set it equal for the parallel scenario, and solved for \\(K\\).\n\n### Step 4: Verification\n\nLet's verify by plugging back into the slope formula to ensure that our computations are coherent. \n\n- For our suspected \\(K = 1\\); the line from \\((7, 4)\\) to \\((0, 1)\\) should have a slope of \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\):\n\n  \\[\n  m = \\frac{1 - 4}{0 - 7} = \\frac{-3}{-7} = \\frac{3}{7}\n  \\]\n\nYes, the slope indeed matches. That checks out! \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThrough careful calculation and verification, I've found that \\(K = 1\\) is the value that makes the line passing through \\((7, 4)\\) and \\((0, K)\\) parallel to the given line \\(3x - 7y = 65\\). \n\nThere we have it! \\(K\\) is definitely 1. Feel pretty confident about this solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We put the equation of the line into slope-intercept form by solving for $y$: $y=\\frac{65-3x}{-7}$. That means the slope of the line is $\\frac{3}{7}$, and the slope of a parallel line must also be $\\frac{3}{7}$. The slope of the line through $(7,4)$ and $(0,K)$ is $\\frac{4-K}{7-0}$, which we set equal to $\\frac{3}{7}$ and solve for $K$. $$\\frac{4-K}{7}=\\frac{3}{7}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 4-K=3 \\qquad\\Rightarrow 1=K$$ So the value of K is $\\boxed{1}$."
