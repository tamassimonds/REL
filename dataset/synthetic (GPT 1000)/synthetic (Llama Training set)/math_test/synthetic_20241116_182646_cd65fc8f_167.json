    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by thinking through it step-by-step. We have an infinite sum that looks like: \n\n$$\\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{2}{7^2} + \\frac{1}{7^3} + \\frac{2}{7^4} + \\cdots$$\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- The series alternates between coefficients of \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) but always uses a power of 7 in the denominator.\n- My first hunch is that this reminds me of a geometric series, although the coefficients are not constant.\n- Geometric series have a common ratio, and their sums are based on this ratio. However, this series doesn\u2019t appear to be a straightforward geometric series because of the alternating coefficients.\n- So, I might need to break down the series into parts that are more easily summable or use some other method to simplify the expression.\n\n**Exploratory Thinking:**\n\n- Could I break this series into two separate series, one involving the terms with coefficients of 1, and another with coefficients of 2? \n- Perhaps summing these two separate series could be a more structured way to tackle the larger problem. This reminds me slightly of decomposing into simpler components.\n\n**Implementation of this Idea:**\n\n1. Break the sum into two parts:\n   - Series A: \\(\\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{7^3} + \\frac{1}{7^5} + \\cdots\\)\n   - Series B: \\(\\frac{2}{7^2} + \\frac{2}{7^4} + \\frac{2}{7^6} + \\cdots\\)\n\n2. Analyze Series A:\n   - Notice that the powers of 7 are odd here.\n   - I could express this series as: \n     $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{7^{2n+1}}$$\n   - This looks like a geometric series with a first term \\(a = \\frac{1}{7}\\) and a common ratio \\(r = \\frac{1}{49}\\) (since \\(r = \\frac{1}{7^2}\\)).\n\n3. Summing Series A:\n   - The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by \\(\\frac{a}{1-r}\\).\n   - For Series A, \\(a = \\frac{1}{7}\\) and \\(r = \\frac{1}{49}\\).\n   - So, \\(S_A = \\frac{\\frac{1}{7}}{1-\\frac{1}{49}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{7}}{\\frac{48}{49}} = \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{49}{48} = \\frac{49}{336} = \\frac{7}{48}\\).\n\n4. Analyze Series B:\n   - This series can be expressed as:\n     $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{7^{2n+2}}$$ \n   - Simplifying gives: \n     $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{49 \\times 7^{2n}} = \\frac{2}{49} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{49^n}$$\n   - This is also a geometric series with \\(a = \\frac{2}{49}\\) and \\(r = \\frac{1}{49}\\).\n\n5. Summing Series B:\n   - \\(S_B = \\frac{\\frac{2}{49}}{1 - \\frac{1}{49}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{49}}{\\frac{48}{49}} = \\frac{2}{48} = \\frac{1}{24}\\).\n\n6. Combine Series A and B:\n   - The sum of the original series will be the sum of these two results: \\(S = S_A + S_B = \\frac{7}{48} + \\frac{1}{24}\\).\n   - Convert \\(\\frac{1}{24}\\) to have a common denominator: \\(\\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{2}{48}\\).\n   - So, \\(S = \\frac{7}{48} + \\frac{2}{48} = \\frac{9}{48} = \\frac{3}{16}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This process seems correct because breaking the series into simpler parts enabled a straightforward application of geometric series summation formulas.\n- It looks like a good combination of strategies led us to a coherent solution.\n- I understand that the crux of the complication was in interacting series with non-standard increments, which was solved by reformulating into alternating geometric series.\n  \nThus, the infinite sum is \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\).",
