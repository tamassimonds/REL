    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- The problem is asking for the next number in a specific row of Pascal's Triangle, one that starts with a 1 and then a 10. Hmm, the mention of 10 immediately makes me think of the row in Pascal's Triangle corresponding to the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{1}\\). Each row in Pascal's Triangle is derived from the binomial expansion, and there\u2019s a pattern in these rows.\n\nBrainstorming:\n- Pascal's Triangle starts with a single 1 at the top. The next row is 1, 1, then 1, 2, 1, and so on. \n- So if a row starts with 1 and has a 10 next, it sounds like \\(\\binom{n}{1} = n\\), which means I'm potentially looking at the 10th row or thereabouts. Let me think about what the numbers in this row could be.\n  \n- Another approach would be to remember the combinatorial interpretation: the numbers in Pascal's Triangle can also be thought of as counting the number of ways to choose items from a set, often expressed as \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\).\n\nReflecting:\n- Okay, I'm realizing that looking at \\(\\binom{n}{1} = 10\\) means that we are indeed in the row of Pascal's Triangle where n is 10. But wait, I should verify this by connecting it to other known numbers in Pascal\u2019s Triangle.\n  \nPossible Clarification:\n- Pascal's Triangle should start like this from the top down: \n  1  \n  1, 1  \n  1, 2, 1  \n  1, 3, 3, 1  \n  1, 4, 6, 4, 1  \n  And it continues, but I need to check how this aligns with \\(\\binom{10}{1}\\).\n\nRealization:\n- The rows start with \\(\\binom{n}{0}\\), \\(\\binom{n}{1}\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(\\binom{n}{n}\\). Hence a row starts as 1, 10,... means the row is the 10th row starting from \\(\\binom{10}{0}\\).\n\nCheck:\n- To backtrack and verify, the 10th row (0-indexed) would be, listing from 0 up to 10:\n  \\(\\binom{10}{0}, \\binom{10}{1}, \\binom{10}{2}, \\ldots\\).\n- And substituting values, we start with 1 (\\(\\binom{10}{0}\\)), 10 (\\(\\binom{10}{1}\\))... so we should explore further at \\(\\binom{10}{2}\\).\n\nCalculation:\n- I should calculate the next number, which ideally is \\(\\binom{10}{2}\\). This represents the number of ways to choose 2 objects from 10, defined mathematically as:\n  \\[\n  \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45\n  \\]\n\nConclusion:\n- So the row starts 1, 10, 45. This consistent pattern with \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). The next number in this sequence is indeed 45.\n\nFinal Reflection:\n- This looks right. I thought through the setup of Pascal\u2019s Triangle, aligned this with the properties of combinations, calculated practically by checking the values to ensure consistency. It feels satisfying to verify each step aligns logically and mathematically.",

  "ground_truth": "The row that starts 1, 10 is the row $\\binom{10}{0}, \\binom{10}{1}, \\binom{10}{2},\\ldots$, so the next number is $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10\\cdot 9}{2\\cdot 1} = \\boxed{45}$."
