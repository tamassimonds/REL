    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're tasked with dividing 10 players into two teams of 5 for an intra-squad scrimmage in as many ways as possible. So, let's approach this step by step.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nThis problem reminds me of combinations. We're selecting teams out of a group where the order doesn't matter, which suggests using combination math. Oh, but wait! We're dividing into two equal teams, so I need to consider any symmetry issues that might arise.\n\nFirst let's brainstorm the strategy:\n\n- I could calculate combinations for choosing 5 players from 10. That seems straightforward as a start.\n- Reflect: Wait, there might be something about double-counting since the remaining, unchosen players automatically become the second team.\n- Explore more: Calculate potential permutations of ordering the players and then factor in symmetry. Or maybe there's symmetry in team selection itself?\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Choose 5 players out of 10:**\n\n   - I initially think this is just a combinatorial problem where I need to choose 5 players from 10. The formula for combinations should work here:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5! \\times (10-5)!}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Combination:**\n\n   - Let's compute this:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 252\n     \\]\n\n3. **Reflect on Symmetry:**\n\n   - But wait, my earlier thought process flagged a potential issue: Choosing 5 players automatically determines the other team of 5. So it seems like I might have counted each division twice. \n\n4. **Account for Double Counting:**\n\n   - To fix this, I divide the result by 2, since dividing into two identical teams should mean each arrangement is counted twice:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{252}{2} = 126\n     \\]\n\n5. **Reflect and Check:**\n\n   - Let me quickly consider if the approach makes sense. Yes, reflecting on it, choosing a 5-player team from 10 does indeed determine the other team straightforwardly, and symmetry means dividing by 2 is correct.\n\n6. **Double-Check with an Intuitive Strategy:**\n\n   - Could there be a simpler thought experiment to cross-verifying? Consider labeling players (say players 1 to 10). Any team formation with player 1 equally splits, with results confirming the computational approach. This test supports the calculation.\n\n**Final Solution:**\n\nSo, the number of ways to split the 10 players into two teams of five, without any conditions, is indeed 126.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy leveraging combinatorial thinking and correcting for symmetry, the task brought clarity and confidence to the final answer. Perfect! Reflections on potential missteps ensured accuracy throughout.",

  "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{10}{5} = 252$ ways to choose players for the first team, and the second team gets the remaining players.  However, since the teams are interchangeable, we must divide by two, so the answer is $252 / 2 = \\boxed{126}$."
