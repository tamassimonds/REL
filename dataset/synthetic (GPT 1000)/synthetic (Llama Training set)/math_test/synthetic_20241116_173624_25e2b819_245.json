    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem of computing \\( (2^3)(5^5) \\) by thinking through it step-by-step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- Okay, this involves exponents, and I'll need to calculate each part separately before combining them. \n- I recognize that I'll be working with powers of 2 and powers of 5, which I've seen before, especially in basic multiplication problems.\n- The numbers are relatively small, so I assume I could handle these calculations mentally or through simple arithmetic thinking.\n\n### Brainstorming Ways to Approach:\n1. **Break Down the Problem**: Compute \\(2^3\\) and \\(5^5\\) separately, then multiply the results to get the final answer.\n2. **Look for Patterns or Shortcuts**: Sometimes when combining two numbers with powers, there might be a recognizable pattern or multiplicative rule I can use to simplify.\n3. **Verify Calculations Step-by-Step**: Regularly check if the calculations and thought processes are accurate and make sense.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n1. **Calculate \\(2^3\\)**:\n   - \\(2^3\\) means \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2\\).\n   - Compute \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\), then \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\).\n   - So, \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n\n   This feels correct as I've done simple powers of 2 several times before. I\u2019ll move on to the next part.\n\n2. **Calculate \\(5^5\\)**:\n   - \\(5^5\\) means \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5\\).\n   - Calculating step by step:\n     - First, \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\).\n     - Then, \\(25 \\times 5 = 125\\).\n     - Next, \\(125 \\times 5 = 625\\).\n     - Finally, \\(625 \\times 5 = 3125\\).\n   - So, \\(5^5 = 3125\\).\n\n   Wow, 3125 is quite a large number for a power of 5, but everything lines up correctly while multiplying. This seems right to me.\n\n3. **Multiply the Results**:\n   - Now it's time to multiply the results of the two computations: \\(8 \\times 3125\\).\n   - This seems a bit hefty to do mentally but let\u2019s try breaking it down: \n     - Multiply \\(8 \\times 3125\\) directly might be challenging, so break it into steps.\n     - Think of this as: \\(8 \\times (3000 + 125)\\). \n     - First, \\(8 \\times 3000 = 24000\\).\n     - Then, \\(8 \\times 125 = 1000\\).\n     - Add these two products: \\(24000 + 1000 = 25000\\).\n\n### Verification and Double-Checking:\n- Alright, so far everything seems correct. The breakdown seems reasonable, and the math checks out.\n- I double-checked each multiplication step to ensure there were no small addition or multiplication errors.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOkay, now I have my final result. I put everything together and the answer is \\( (2^3)(5^5) = 25000 \\). \n- This process makes sense step by step, and I didn't run into any logical errors.\n\nReflecting on it helped me identify potential pitfalls at each stage. It's always good to break it down, especially when tackling mental calculations with moderately large numbers.",
