    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle the problem of rationalizing the denominator in the expression \\(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{7}}\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nFirst, I need to understand what rationalizing the denominator means. In this context, it means transforming the expression so that there are no irrational numbers (like square roots) in the denominator. This looks familiar because I've encountered problems like this in the past. The typical approach involves multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same expression to eliminate the square root in the denominator.\n\n### Brainstorming\n\n- **Strategy 1**: Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(\\sqrt{7}\\). This is the most straightforward method and usually works for expressions of this form. The idea is that \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) times \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) will eliminate the square root by producing the whole number 7.\n  \n- **Strategy 2**: Consider multiplying by the conjugate if the denominator were more complex, like involving a binomial. However, since we only have a single term \\(\\sqrt{7}\\), the conjugate approach isn't necessary here.\n\nI feel good about Strategy 1 because it's simple and directly applies to the situation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Current Expression**: \\(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{7}}\\)\n\n2. **Multiply by \\(\\sqrt{7}\\)**: I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) to eliminate the square root from the denominator.\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{7}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2\\sqrt{7} \\times \\sqrt{7}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Denominator**: Now, I need to calculate \\(\\sqrt{7} \\times \\sqrt{7}\\), which equals 7.\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2 \\times 7} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{14}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Result**: The rationalized form of \\(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{7}}\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{14}\\).\n\n### Reflection and Check\n\n- **Check the Multiplication**: I multiplied the numerator and denominator correctly by \\(\\sqrt{7}\\). The denominator becomes 14, confirming that there are no irrational numbers left there.\n\n- **Rationalization Achieved**: The process successfully removed the square root from the denominator. The expression \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{14}\\) is now fully rationalized.\n\n### Insight\n\nOh! Just a quick insight: always ensure the multiplication step (both numerator and denominator) is executed carefully. It\u2019s interesting how the simple multiplication by \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) resolves the entire problem smoothly.\n\nIf I were solving a more complex problem with binomials, I would explore the conjugate method. But here, this approach was perfect.\n\nI'm confident this solution is correct and aligns with the goal of rationalizing the denominator. This process reminds me of simplifying fractions in basic algebra, just with the added twist of dealing with radicals.",
