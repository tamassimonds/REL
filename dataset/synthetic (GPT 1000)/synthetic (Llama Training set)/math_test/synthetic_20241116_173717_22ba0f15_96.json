    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem by thinking through it step by step. The question is asking for the midpoint of the line segment between two points, \\( P = (5,3) \\) and \\( Q = (-3,6) \\). Let's take a moment to brainstorm ways to find the midpoint.\n\n### Brainstorming\n\n- **Recalling formulas**: I remember there\u2019s a formula for finding the midpoint of a line segment in a Cartesian plane. It involves averages, which makes sense intuitively because the midpoint should be the average of the coordinates of the endpoints.\n  \n- **Visual understanding**: If I plot the points on a graph, the midpoint is just halfway between them in both the x-direction and the y-direction. This graphical understanding aligns with using averages.\n\n- **Strategy check**: No special geometry appears necessary here beyond the formula. I don't see any other obvious methods\u2014vector methods might be overkill, and symmetry ideas don\u2019t immediately apply further than using averages.\n\n### Planning\n\nGiven the brainstorming, I'll proceed by using the midpoint formula:\n\nThe midpoint \\( M \\) of a line segment between two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is given by:\n\\[ \nM = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right) \n\\]\n\nApplying this to the points \\( P = (5, 3) \\) and \\( Q = (-3, 6) \\) requires substituting these coordinates into the formula.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1. **Substitute the x-coordinates**:\n   - \\( x_1 = 5 \\) and \\( x_2 = -3 \\)\n   - Midpoint x-coordinate: \\( \\frac{5 + (-3)}{2} = \\frac{5 - 3}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\)\n\n2. **Substitute the y-coordinates**:\n   - \\( y_1 = 3 \\) and \\( y_2 = 6 \\)\n   - Midpoint y-coordinate: \\( \\frac{3 + 6}{2} = \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \\)\n\nSo, the midpoint \\( M \\) is \\( (1, 4.5) \\).\n\n### Checking Work\n\n- **Intuition and graphing**: If I plot this line segment and estimate the midpoint based on symmetry and average, the point \\( (1, 4.5) \\) seems reasonable given our formula checks involve quite straightforward addition and division.\n  \n- **Quick sanity check**: Both the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) coordinates calculated are feasible averages given the endpoints:\n  - In the \\( x \\)-direction, moving from 5 to -3, it's logical that 1 is the central balance point.\n  - In the \\( y \\)-direction, averaging 3 and 6 gives us exactly the halfway point, 4.5.\n\n- **Mistake scan**: Finally, revisiting each calculation for potential arithmetic errors shows they\u2019re correctly performed. Nothing sticks out as incorrect based on both intuition and calculation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOur calculated midpoint: \\( (1, 4.5) \\) is indeed correct. The approach was systematic and consistently verified at each step, reinforcing its accuracy. If I encountered any doubt, further visual plots or double-checking specific calculations could help, but right now all seems confirmed.\n\nAh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculation. Let's take a step back and re-examine the problem to ensure that everything is clear and correct.\n\n### Reassessment\n\nGiven the points \\( P = (5, 3) \\) and \\( Q = (-3, 6) \\), we're tasked with finding the midpoint of the line segment \\(\\overline{PQ}\\).\n\n### Brainstorming and Strategy\n\n1. **Formula Re-examination**: The midpoint formula is central here, where the midpoint \\( M \\) of a line segment between points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   M = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right)\n   \\]\n   This formula ideally gives the average of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates, respectively, of the two endpoints.\n\n2. **Quick Check on Intuition**: Visually, if we draw the points \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) on a graph, the midpoint should land somewhere around the center of the two points, taking into account both x and y values.\n\n3. **Re-Verification**: It\u2019s always a good idea to double-check calculations, especially simple arithmetic, which is where errors tend to slip through unnoticed.\n\n### New Calculation\n\n#### Step-by-Step Check\n\n1. **Re-evaluate x-coordinates**:\n   - \\( x_1 = 5 \\), \\( x_2 = -3 \\)\n   - The average or midpoint x-coordinate: \\(\\frac{5 + (-3)}{2} = \\frac{5 - 3}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\\)\n\n2. **Re-evaluate y-coordinates**:\n   - \\( y_1 = 3 \\), \\( y_2 = 6 \\)\n   - The average or midpoint y-coordinate: \\(\\frac{3 + 6}{2} = \\frac{9}{2}\\)\n\nThus, the correct midpoint \\( M \\) is indeed \\((1, \\frac{9}{2})\\).\n\n### Reflection and Verification\n\n- **Visual Sanity Check**: Plotting this scenario in my mind, the numbers seem logical. The x-coordinate of the midpoint is exactly halfway between 5 and -3, and the y-coordinate matches the expected average between 3 and 6.\n\n- **Verification of Arithmetic**: Given the reassessment, my calculations hold correctly this time. The mistakes were caught early through re-analysis and careful arithmetic checks.\n\n- **Confidence in the Solution**: Double-checking and re-calculating have solidly confirmed that \\((1, \\frac{9}{2})\\) is the correct and accurate midpoint of \\(\\overline{PQ}\\).\n\nI'm feeling confident that the calculations are now accurate and align with both the logical and mathematical framework necessary for finding midpoints.",
