    "working_out": "First Impressions:\n- A pyramid makes me think of a 3D geometric shape with a base and sloping triangular faces meeting at a common point. \n- I remember from geometry that pyramids have a distinct vertex for their apex and the rest of their vertices form the polygonal base. \n- The question asks about the number of vertices, given that the pyramid has 14 edges. This seems like a problem that involves spatial reasoning or possibly a known formula.\n\nBrainstorming:\n- This problem seems like it could be related to Euler's formula for polyhedra, which is \\( V - E + F = 2 \\), where \\( V \\) is vertices, \\( E \\) is edges, and \\( F \\) is faces.\n- If Euler's formula applies, then knowing edges could help find vertices if the number of faces is determined too.\n\nFirst Attempt:\n1. Let\u2019s say the base is a polygon with \\( n \\) sides. This means it has \\( n \\) vertices at its base.\n2. Each of these vertices connects to the apex of the pyramid, forming triangular faces.\n3. There is one apex vertex, making one more vertex than the number of base vertices. \n\nA pyramid with a polygonal base:\n- **Base has \\( n \\) edges, thus \\( n \\) vertices.**\n- **Vertical triangular edges going from \\( n \\) base vertices to the apex vertex.**\n\nCounting edges:\n- The pyramid would have \\( n \\) base edges.\n- Additionally, each base vertex is connected to the apex vertex, making \\( n \\) more vertical edges.\n- Total edges = \\( n + n = 2n \\).\n\nReflexive Check:\n- Oh! The total number of edges \\( (2n) \\) is given as 14 in the problem. \n- This setup implies that \\( 2n = 14 \\).\n\nNew Realization:\n- Solving \\( 2n = 14 \\), we divide both sides by 2, getting \\( n = 7 \\).\n- The base is a heptagon, meaning 7 sides and therefore 7 vertices.\n- Adding the one apex vertex, we have \\( 7 + 1 = 8 \\) vertices in total.\n\nReflect and Validate:\n- This aligns with Euler's formula since: \n  - Number of faces: \\( 7\\) (triangular ones) + 1 (base) = 8\n  - Euler\u2019s formula: \\( V - E + F = 2 \\)\n  - Check: \\( 8 - 14 + 8 = 2 \\)\n\nConclusion:\n- The number of vertices in the pyramid is correctly found to be 8.\n- This approach checks out, confirming understanding through multiple checks, both with the formula and visualizing the elements.",

  "ground_truth": "If the base of a pyramid has $n$ sides, then the pyramid has $n$ edges on the base and $n$ edges connecting the base vertices to the apex (a total of $2n$ edges). The base has $n$ vertices and the apex is a vertex, so there are $n+1$ vertices. If a pyramid has $14$ edges, then $n=\\frac{14}{2}=7$ and there are $n+1=\\boxed{8}$ vertices."
