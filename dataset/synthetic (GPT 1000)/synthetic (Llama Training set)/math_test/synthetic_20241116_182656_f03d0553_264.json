    "working_out": "**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, I see this is a problem involving time zones and travel. The time zone difference might trip me up, but let's work through this systematically. First reaction: this seems like it has a few pieces that need to be converted and aligned. The main point of the problem is to find out what time it is in Denver when the train arrives. The time zone difference is two hours, so when it's 2 p.m. in New York, it's noon in Denver. \n\nI should track both New York and Denver's times separately first, and then convert when necessary. But wait, the travel time is given as 45 hours. Hmm... maybe that's actually the key component because it spans into the next couple of days. I have a feeling the day of arrival might switch over during the process.\n\n**Step-by-step Approach:**\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Time Zone Difference**\n\nGiven:\n- When it's noon in New York, it's 10 a.m. in Denver.\n- Therefore, Denver is 2 hours behind New York.\n\nSo, when the train leaves New York at 2 p.m., it\u2019s actually starting at 12 p.m. Denver time.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Arrival Time in New York Time**\n\nThe train leaves at 2 p.m. (New York time) and arrives 45 hours later. Let\u2019s calculate:\n\n2 p.m. plus 24 hours is 2 p.m. the next day (let's reflect for accuracy here: I only need 24 more hours to return to the same time on the next day).\n\nContinuing, 2 p.m. plus another 21 hours (to complete the 45 hours total):\nWhen I'm adding, this would give 2 p.m. + 21 hours = 11 a.m. two days later (i.e., 2 days later but less 3 hours).\n\nTo rethink for clarity, I'm adding effectively one complete day (24 hours) and another 21 hours. I ensure that my days counted are right: Day 1 would end 2 p.m. the next day making it '0 time' over one day, and then continuing for another set to reach 24, adds one more whole day ...ah, and 21 more hours means less than that day, hence 11 a.m. at partial count.\n\n**Step 3: Convert New York Arrival Time to Denver Time**\n\nNow since I established that at 11 a.m. New York time, Denver would be:\n\n11 a.m. N.Y. time - 2 hours = 9 a.m. Denver time.\n\nHere\u2019s another check: It makes sense, given Denver is behind New York time. \n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nGetting to 9 a.m. Denver when starting at 12 p.m. (same day of departure) looks right to me. Adding up my full count on adding days and hours shows I\u2019m dealing with a transition that I correctly compensated for in hours with day counteract into second day consequence. \n\nReevaluating, I intuitively started thinking this possibly involves many time misunderstandings if I mistook even one addition hand moved to \"cross day,\" but I avoided that mistake early on with my 24-hour resets. Do I correlate other methods? This aligns pretty realistically with the whole time travel concept: full successive hours tally up to destination times.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe time in Denver when the train arrives would be 9 a.m.",

  "ground_truth": "2 p.m. New York time is noon in Denver.  45 hours past noon is 21 hours past noon the next day, which is 9 a.m. the day after that.  Think about it this way - 48 hours would mean two full days, and 45 hours is 3 hours less than that, thus, 3 hours before noon is $\\boxed{9\\text{ a.m.}}$"
