    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. This looks like a problem where knowing about properties of polynomials and how they relate to their roots could be useful. Here's what comes to my mind initially:\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- The problem gives us a polynomial \\(x^3 + 9x^2 - 9x - 8\\) with roots \\(r, s,\\) and \\(t\\).\n- We are asked to find the product \\((r + s)(s + t)(t + r)\\).\n\nThis reminds me of Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. According to Vieta's formulas for a cubic polynomial \\(x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) with roots \\(r, s, t\\):\n- \\(r+s+t = -a\\)\n- \\(rs+rt+st = b\\)\n- \\(rst = -c\\)\n\nSo, let's start by identifying these values for our polynomial. \n\n### Step 1: Identify coefficients:\nThe polynomial is \\(x^3 + 9x^2 - 9x - 8\\). Comparing this with the general form \\(x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c\\), we have:\n- \\(a = 9\\),\n- \\(b = -9\\),\n- \\(c = -8\\).\n\n### Step 2: Use Vieta's Formulas:\nUsing Vieta's formulas for the given polynomial:\n- \\(r + s + t = -9\\)\n- \\(rs + rt + st = -9\\)\n- \\(rst = 8\\)\n\n### Step 3: Analyze What is Required:\nThe problem requires us to find \\((r+s)(s+t)(t+r)\\). This looks tricky since it's not directly one of the sums or products in Vieta's formulas. But I notice something:\n\n#### Insight:\nOh! I remember an identity involving symmetric sums:\n\\[\n(r+s)(s+t)(t+r) = (r+s+t)(rs+rt+st) - rst\n\\]\n\nThis identity will be super useful here since it involves terms that we can directly calculate from Vieta's.\n\n### Step 4: Plug Values into the Identity:\nUsing the insights from Vieta's formulas and the identity:\n1. \\(r+s+t = -9\\)\n2. \\(rs+rt+st = -9\\)\n3. \\(rst = 8\\)\n\nLet's substitute these values into the identity:\n\\[\n(r+s)(s+t)(t+r) = (-9)(-9) - 8\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\\[\n81 - 8 = 73\n\\]\n\n### Final Check:\n- Double-checking if all steps use correct arithmetic and logical procedures.\n- Vieta's values: check.\n- Substitution into identity: check.\n- Arithmetic is accurate.\n\nThe calculated value of \\((r+s)(s+t)(t+r)\\) is \\(73\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe problem used polynomial root properties beautifully, and substituting into the identity was the key step. Revisiting each part confirms our solution, so I'm confident in the correctness. \n\nFinal answer: \\( \\boxed{73} \\)",

  "ground_truth": "By Vieta's formulas, $r + s + t = -9.$\n\nSince $r,$ $s,$ $t$ are the roots of $x^3 + 9x^2 - 9x - 8,$\n\\[x^3 + 9x^2 - 9x - 8 = (x - r)(x - s)(x - t).\\]Substituting $x = r + s + t = -9$ into the polynomial, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n (r + s)(r + t)(s + t) &= (-9)^3+9\\cdot (-9)^2-9\\cdot(-9)-8 \\\\\n  &= \\boxed{73}.\n\\end{align*}"
