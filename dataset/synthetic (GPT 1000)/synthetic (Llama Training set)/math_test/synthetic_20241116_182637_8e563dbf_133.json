    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step and really think it through like an exploratory journey. Here we go:\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I notice it's a straightforward algebraic equation kind of problem. The phrase \"If \\( x \\) is doubled and then increased by 7, the result is 81\" catches my eye. It immediately makes me think of operations that can be represented mathematically with algebra. This feels like setting up an equation and solving for \\( x \\).\n\n**The Problem Statement:**\n\nI'm being asked to find a value for \\( x \\), given that if you double \\( x \\) and then add 7, you get 81. Before jumping straight into solving, let's just brainstorm what this could look like:\n\n- Doubling \\( x \\) suggests multiplication by 2.\n- Increasing by 7 suggests addition.\n- The result being 81 suggests equality, where these operations should sum up to 81.\n\n**Potential Approaches:**\n\n1. **Set up an equation**\u2014this seems like the most natural fit: I can express the problem as an algebraic equation and solve for \\( x \\).\n \n2. **Trial and error**\u2014start guessing possible numbers for \\( x \\), although that doesn't sound efficient for this case but might be helpful later if I feel stuck.\n\n3. **Reverse operations**\u2014work backwards from 81 since reversing operations can sometimes simplify understanding.\n\n4. **Graphical method**\u2014since it's a small and simple equation, graphing isn't necessary here, but it's still something worth mentioning as it can help in more complex cases.\n\n**Deciding on an Approach:**\n\nGiven the nature of the problem, setting up an equation is the most straightforward and reliable method. But let's stay flexible, in case this gets more confusing for some reason.\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\nThe problem says: \"If \\( x \\) is doubled and then increased by 7, the result is 81.\"\n\nTranslating this into a mathematical equation, it becomes:\n\\[ 2x + 7 = 81 \\]\n\n**Solving the Equation:**\n\n1. **Isolate the term with \\( x \\):**\n\n   I want to get \\( 2x \\) by itself on one side of the equation, so I\u2019ll subtract 7 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2x + 7 - 7 = 81 - 7\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x = 74\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n\n   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{74}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 37\n   \\]\n\n**Checking Our Work:**\n\nLet's make sure this value of \\( x \\) makes sense. I'll substitute \\( x = 37 \\) back into the original context of the problem:\n\n- Double \\( 37 \\):  \\( 2 \\times 37 = 74 \\)\n- Increase by 7: \\( 74 + 7 = 81 \\)\n\nYes, this follows exactly what the problem statement lays out. That means \\( x = 37 \\) should be correct.\n\n**Reflections:**\n\nLooking back, this was pretty straightforward as predicted. Our algebraic approach was right and efficient for this problem. Trying other methods like trial and error could have worked too, but likely wouldn't be as clean or quick.\n\nSo there we go! The value of \\( x \\) is indeed \\( 37 \\). Solving it methodically ensured that we didn\u2019t miss any details. If something had gone awry, there'd be definite points to check and adjust.",
