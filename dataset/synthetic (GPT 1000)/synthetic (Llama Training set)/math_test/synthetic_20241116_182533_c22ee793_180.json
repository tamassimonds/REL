    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and try to figure out how best to factor the expression \\(7x^2 - 63\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Expression\nFirst, let's look at the expression \\(7x^2 - 63\\). This looks like a quadratic expression with a leading term of \\(7x^2\\) and a constant term of \\(-63\\). My gut feeling is that this might involve factoring out a common factor or recognizing a difference of squares form.\n\n### Step 2: Check for Common Factors\nA common technique for factoring is to first see if there's a greatest common factor (GCF) we can pull out. Let's see if there's anything common between \\(7x^2\\) and \\(-63\\).\n\n- The coefficient of the \\(x^2\\) term is 7.\n- The constant term, \\(-63\\), is also divisible by 7.\n\nSo they both have a factor of 7. Let's factor 7 out from both terms:\n\n\\[ 7x^2 - 63 = 7(x^2 - 9) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Result\nNow, inside the parentheses, we have \\(x^2 - 9\\). I recognize this as a difference of squares, a common algebraic identity:\n\n\\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\]\n\nIn our case, \\(x^2 - 9\\) is equivalent to \\(x^2 - 3^2\\), which means we can factor it further:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3) \\]\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Factors\nNow, incorporating this back into our previous step where we factored out the 7, we have:\n\n\\[ 7(x^2 - 9) = 7(x - 3)(x + 3) \\]\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Result\nOkay, let's take a moment to verify this works. I need to ensure that multiplying back all the factors gives me the original expression:\n\n\\[ 7(x - 3)(x + 3) = 7 \\times (x^2 - 9) = 7x^2 - 63 \\]\n\nPerfect! I\u2019ve factored the expression correctly.\n\n### Reflections and Notes\n- Initially, I thought about common factors, which was a good starting point.\n- Recognizing the difference of squares was key for the inner expression.\n- I\u2019m glad I checked my work and multiplied it back out, confirming the factorization was correct.\n\nThis problem was a nice exercise in recognizing patterns and applying basic factoring techniques. Always a good practice to check and reflect at each step!",
