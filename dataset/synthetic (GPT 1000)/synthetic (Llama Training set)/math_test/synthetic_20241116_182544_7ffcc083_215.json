    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. At first glance, I see a quadratic equation involving parameters \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) and the variable \\( x \\). The question specifies that it has one integer root and one non-integer root. Initially, I feel like the problem might require finding explicit expressions for the roots, which means going through some algebraic manipulation.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Equation**\n\nStarting with given equation:\n\\[\n(ax - b)^2 + (bx - a)^2 = x\n\\]\nThis quadratic seems a bit complicated, so maybe expanding it will provide a clearer view of the relationship between the terms. \n\n**Step 2: Expanding the Equation**\n\nLet's expand each square term:\n\\[\n(ax - b)^2 = a^2x^2 - 2abx + b^2\n\\]\n\\[\n(bx - a)^2 = b^2x^2 - 2abx + a^2\n\\]\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[\na^2x^2 - 2abx + b^2 + b^2x^2 - 2abx + a^2 = x\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n(a^2 + b^2)x^2 - 4abx + (b^2 + a^2) = x\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Bringing to Standard Form**\n\nLet's rearrange this into standard quadratic form \\( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 \\):\n\\[\n(a^2 + b^2)x^2 - 4abx + (b^2 + a^2) - x = 0\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms:\n\\[\n(a^2 + b^2)x^2 - (4ab + 1)x + (b^2 + a^2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Exploring the Discriminant**\n\nFor a quadratic equation with coefficients \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) like \\(Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0\\), the discriminant \\(\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC\\) determines the nature of the roots.\n\nHere, \\( A = a^2 + b^2 \\), \\( B = -(4ab + 1) \\), \\( C = b^2 + a^2 \\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-(4ab + 1))^2 - 4(a^2 + b^2)(b^2 + a^2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (4ab + 1)^2 - 4(a^2 + b^2)^2\n\\]\n\nSetting \\(\\Delta = 0\\) is the typical case for one repeated root, so I need \\(\\Delta > 0\\) to ensure two distinct roots, where one is an integer.\n\nSince the problem states one root is integer and another non-integer, further simplification or substitution might be needed to study specific conditions.\n\n**Step 5: Guess and Check with Integer Values**\n\nHow about we guess some values for co-efficients \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) and test their fitness. \n\nIf the root is integer, say assume \\(x = n\\), where replacing in reshuffled polynomial should aid in its calculations: \n\\[\n(a^2 + b^2)n^2 - (4ab + 1)n + (b^2 + a^2) = 0\n\\]\n\nWe could start with trying small values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), contemplating the algebra simpliest restriction.\n\n- Assume \\( a = 1, b = 1 \\): Check if any simplification/solutions can meet criteria.\n\nLet's substitute \\(a = 1, b=1\\):\n\nQuadratic becomes:\n\\[\n(1^2 + 1^2)x^2 - (4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 + 1)x + (1^2 + 1^2) = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 6: Calculating Roots Using Quadratic Formula**\n\nUse quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2A}\\):\nHere, \\(A = 2\\), \\(B = -5\\), \\(C = 2\\),\nDiscriminant:\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 25 - 16 = 9 > 0\n\\]\n\nReal roots imply:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5 \\pm 3}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{8}{4} = 2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Step 7: Conclusion**\n\nThe equation has roots \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\). Here \\(2\\) is an integer root and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) a non-integer root. \n\nThus, entirely evident is the non-integer root:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nI tried an approach using specific integer assumptions initially made possible after completing squares and calculated via standard algebraic formulae for quadratic roots in checking conditions.",

  "ground_truth": "The given equation expands to\n\\[(a^2 + b^2) x^2 - (4ab + 1) x + a^2 + b^2 = 0.\\]Since the quadratic has an integer root, its discriminant is nonnegative:\n\\[(4ab + 1)^2 - 4(a^2 + b^2)^2 \\ge 0.\\]This factors as\n\\[(4ab + 1 + 2a^2 + 2b^2)(4ab + 1 - 2a^2 - 2b^2) \\ge 0.\\]We can write this as\n\\[[1 + 2(a + b)^2][1 - 2(a - b)^2] \\ge 0.\\]Since $1 + 2(a + b)^2$ is always nonnegative,\n\\[1 - 2(a - b)^2 \\ge 0,\\]so $(a - b)^2 \\le \\frac{1}{2}.$\n\nRecall that $a$ and $b$ are integers.

Then by Vieta's formulas,\n\\[r + s = \\frac{4a^2 + 1}{2a^2} = 2 + \\frac{1}{2a^2},\\]and $rs = 1.$\n\nSince $rs = 1,$ either both $r$ and $s$ are positive, or both $r$ and $s$ are negative.  Since $r + s$ is positive, $r$ and $s$ are positive.  Since $a$ is an integer,\n\\[r + s = 2 + \\frac{1}{2a^2} < 3,\\]so the integer $r$ must be 1 or 2.  If $r = 1,$ then $s = 1,$ so both roots are integers, contradiction.  Hence, $r = 2,$ and $s = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.$  (For these values, we can take $a = 1.$)"
