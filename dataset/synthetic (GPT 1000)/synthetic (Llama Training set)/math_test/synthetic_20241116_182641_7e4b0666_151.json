    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this. First, let's gather what the problem is telling us. We have three squares:\\(ABCD\\), \\(EFGH\\), and \\(ASHY\\), with side lengths \\(AB = EF = 1\\) and \\(AY = 5\\). We need to find the area of quadrilateral \\(DYES\\).\n\nLet\u2019s start by visualizing and analyzing the problem step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n- \\(ABCD\\) is a square of side length 1. So, coordinates of \\(A, B, C, D\\) can be \\(A(0, 5), B(1, 5), D(1, 4), C(0, 4)\\).\n- Similarly, \\(EFGH\\) is a square of side length 1. Given \\(EF = 1\\), and likely oriented such that \\(G(4, 0)\\) points are \\(E(4, 1), F(5, 1), G(4, 0), H(5, 0)\\).\n- \\(ASHY\\) is a larger square with side length 5, resulting in \\(A(0, 5), S(5, 5), H(5, 0), Y(0, 0)\\).\n\n**Reflecting:**\n- Seems like a strategy would be to use the coordinates system here, as we already have the coordinates or the means to find them.\n\n### Step 2: Checking relationships\n\n**Understanding Orientation:**\n- With \\(A\\) and \\(Y\\), we can position and confirm that \\(\\overline{AY}\\) aligns with the axis considering it\u2019s a larger square.\n- Noticing \\(S\\) and \\(H\\) is easy when the endpoints confirm that squares \\(ASHY\\).\n\n**Reflect More:**\n- Checking quickly again the coordinates make sense and they seem aligned with squares descriptions given dimensions correct.\n- \\(DYES\\) is a quadrilateral: rewriting these - start with known positions \\[D(1, 4)\\], \\(E(4, 1)\\) and then decide: calculate other vertices double-check using squares guideline.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Areas\n\n**Area Calculation Insights:**\n- Quadrilateral area - polygon coordinate method could be efficient here, using \\((x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \\dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \\dots + y_nx_1)\\).\n\n**Area Application:**\n- Assign coordinates: \n  - \\(D(1, 4)\\), \n  - \\(Y(0, 0)\\),\n  - \\(E(4, 1)\\),\n  - \\(S(5, 5)\\)\n  \nUse shoelace formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} =  \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 1 \\times 0 + 0 \\times 1 + 4 \\times 5 + 5 \\times 4 - (4 \\times 0 + 0 \\times 4 + 1 \\times 5 + 5 \\times 1)\\right|\n\\]\n\n**Compute Areas:**\n- Calculate determinants:\n  - \\(1 \\times 0 + 0 \\times 1 + 4 \\times 5 + 5 \\times 4 = 20 + 20 = 40\\)\n  - \\(4 \\times 0 + 0 \\times 4 + 1 \\times 5 + 5 \\times 1 = 5 + 5 = 10\\)\n  \nFinally:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 40 - 10\\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 = 15\n\\]\n\n**Double Check:**\n- Look back if steps and coordinates remain logical throughout, seem correct and match square build-up.\n\n### Concluding and Reflecting\n\n- The area of quadrilateral \\(DYES\\) is \\(15\\). I confirm calculations appropriately apply coordinate geometry correctly and align with all insights reviewed.\n\nI hope this journey made sense and offers thorough insight into quadrilateral area determination via coordinate approaches!

  "ground_truth": "The large square, $ASHY$, is divided into seven regions. Two of these ($ABDC$ and $EFHG$) are squares. Four of the regions ($BSD,$ $CYD,$ $SFE,$ $YGE$) are right triangles. Finally, the seventh region is $DYES$, the quadrilateral whose area we wish to know. Thus, we subtract the area of the first six regions from the area of $ASHY$.\n\n$ASHY$ has side length $5$ and therefore has area $5^2=25$.\n\nThe two small squares each have side length $1$ and thus area $1$.\n\nThe right triangles each have legs of length $1$ and $4$ (since, for example, $CY = AY-AC = 5-1 = 4$). Thus, each right triangle has area $\\frac{1\\cdot 4}{2} = 2$.\n\nSubtracting the two small squares and the four right triangles from the large square, we determine that the area of $DYES$ is $$25 - 2\\cdot(1) - 4\\cdot(2) = \\boxed{15}.$$"
