    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. The goal is to determine the type of graph represented by the equation \\( y^2 - x + 5y - 25 = 0 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Initial Thoughts and Strategy\n\nFirst, let's recognize what we have:\n- The equation includes a \\( y^2 \\) term but no \\( x^2 \\) term. This immediately rules out a circle or an ellipse, since those involve both \\( x^2 \\) and \\( y^2 \\) terms. \n- This might be a parabola, as parabolas typically have a squared term for only one variable.\n\nHmm... Given the \\( y^2 \\) and the absence of \\( x^2 \\), this does suggest a parabolic structure, but let's be sure by trying to rearrange the equation.\n\n### Step 2: Completing the Square\n\nWhen dealing with equations that have squared terms, completing the square is often a helpful technique to reveal the nature of the graph. Let's start with the \\( y^2 + 5y \\) part of the equation:\n\n\\[ y^2 + 5y \\]\n\nTo complete the square:\n- Take half of the coefficient of \\( y \\), which is \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\), and square it, giving us \\(\\left( \\frac{5}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{4}\\).\n\nLet's adjust the equation to include this completed square:\n\n\\[ y^2 + 5y = \\left( y + \\frac{5}{2} \\right)^2 - \\frac{25}{4} \\]\n\nNow substitute this back into the original equation:\n\n\\[ \\left( y + \\frac{5}{2} \\right)^2 - \\frac{25}{4} - x - 25 = 0 \\]\n\nCombine constant terms on the right:\n\n\\[ \\left( y + \\frac{5}{2} \\right)^2 - x = 25 + \\frac{25}{4} \\]\n\nHmm, I noticed a mistake there with my constants. Let me reevaluate the constants:\n\n### Step 3: Re-evaluate and Simplify\n\nCombine \\( -25 \\) and \\(-\\frac{25}{4}\\):\n\nThe right side constants should be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-100}{4} \\text{ (for -25)} + \\frac{-25}{4} = \\frac{-125}{4} \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ \\left( y + \\frac{5}{2} \\right)^2 = x + \\frac{125}{4} \\]\n\nAt this point, rearranging gives us:\n\n\\[ x = \\left( y + \\frac{5}{2} \\right)^2 - \\frac{125}{4} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Analyze\n\nThis is now clearly the form of a parabola:\n\\[ x = a(y - k)^2 + h \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex, here translated to \\((- \\frac{125}{4}, -\\frac{5}{2})\\)\n- The formula opens along the x-axis, meaning it\u2019s a parabola.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nAfter completing the square and carefully reviewing our steps, it\u2019s clear that \\( y^2 - x + 5y - 25 = 0 \\) represents a parabola.\n\nReflecting on our approach:\n- By completing the square, the nature of the equation became apparent.\n- Double-checking calculations (especially arithmetic and square completions) was crucial to reaching the correct form.\n- Having only a single squared term initially steered us in the right direction toward identifying a parabola.\n\nGiven that our derived form fits that of a standard parabola equation, we can confidently conclude this graph is indeed a parabola.",
