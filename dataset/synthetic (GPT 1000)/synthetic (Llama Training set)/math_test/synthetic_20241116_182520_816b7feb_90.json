    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step and let our thoughts unfold naturally.\n\n**First thoughts:**\n\n1. The problem involves distributing pencils into three bags with the requirement that each bag must contain the same number of pencils, while maximizing the leftover pencils. This rings a bell, as it seems to be related to division and remainders \u2014 similar to problems involving finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) or working with modulo operation.\n   \n2. Typically, with problems like placing items into groups and determining leftovers, the concept of divisibility comes to mind. We need to think about the divisibility of the total number of pencils and the number of groups (which is 3, in this case).\n\n**Brainstorm and draft some strategies:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Consider if there's a way to express the problem mathematically. Let's say the total number of pencils is \\( N \\). We want to distribute these pencils into 3 bags such that each bag gets the same number of pencils and maximize the leftover pencils. In mathematical terms, we divide \\( N \\) by 3, and the leftover pencils would be the remainder when \\( N \\) is divided by 3, i.e., \\( N \\mod 3 \\).\n\n- **Strategy 2:** Could there be a more straightforward example approach? Maybe try with specific numbers of pencils to see what patterns emerge. For instance, if \\( N = 10 \\), how does distributing among the bags look? What if \\( N = 9 \\) or \\( N = 11 \\)?\n\n- **Strategy 3:** Look at what happens in edge cases, perhaps when \\( N \\) is very small, like 1, 2, or just 3. This might help understand the range of possible leftovers.\n\n**Step-by-step calculation and exploration:**\n\n1. **Check with small numbers:** \n\n   - If \\( N = 1 \\), when divided into 3 bags, the quotient is 0, and the remainder is 1. Zach would have 1 leftover pencil because he can't place any into the bags.\n   - If \\( N = 2 \\), similar logic applies: the remainder is 2 (not divisible), so 2 pencils are leftover.\n   - If \\( N = 3 \\), all pencils go into the bags with 0 leftover (perfectly divisible).\n\n2. **Think deeper about the division:**\n\n   - Essentially, we're considering \\( N = 3k + r \\), where \\( r \\) is the remainder. This \\( r \\) can be 0, 1, or 2. We're interested in maximizing \\( r \\). From the problem, it's clear \\( r = 2 \\) is the largest remainder since these are the possibilities when any number is divided by 3.\n\n**Reflection point:**\n\n- Given that dividing by 3 gives remainders of 0, 1, or 2, the greatest possible number of leftover pencils when redistributed in 3 equal groups would always be 2. The crucial understanding here is that any number of pencils can only leave at most 2 remaining pencils when distributed among 3 bags.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\n- With this realization, for any number \\( N \\), the greatest number of pencils left over when attempting to place them evenly into 3 bags is always going to be 2, whenever \\( N \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\).\n\nBy breaking down the problem, trying small examples, and thinking logically about division and remainders, we've arrived at the conclusion. Reflecting on this approach, it seems consistent and adheres to the mathematical properties underlying division, validating that the greatest possible remainder when dividing by 3 is indeed 2.",
