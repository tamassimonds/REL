    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive in and figure this problem out together, step by step. Here\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about it:\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- We need to compute the expression \\(0.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{4} + 0.\\overline{2}\\).\n- Hmm, this reminds me of converting repeating decimals into fractions, which is probably the first step.\n- I don\u2019t have an exact plan yet, but changing them into fractions seems like a familiar strategy.\n\n### Step 1: Convert \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) to a Fraction\n- \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) means 0.777\u2026 continuing infinitely.\n- I remember a trick for converting repeating decimals: Let \\(x = 0.\\overline{7}\\).\n- We multiply by 10 to shift the decimal: \\(10x = 7.\\overline{7}\\).\n- Subtracting the two equations, \\(10x - x = 7.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{7}\\) simplifies to \\(9x = 7\\).\n- Solving for \\(x\\), we get \\(x = \\frac{7}{9}\\).\n- This part seems correct. Let\u2019s note \\(0.\\overline{7} = \\frac{7}{9}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Convert \\(0.\\overline{4}\\) to a Fraction\n- Using the same method: assume \\(y = 0.\\overline{4}\\).\n- Multiply by 10: \\(10y = 4.\\overline{4}\\).\n- Subtracting, \\(10y - y = 4.\\overline{4} - 0.\\overline{4}\\) gives \\(9y = 4\\).\n- So, \\(y = \\frac{4}{9}\\).\n- Yes, this seems right. Thus, \\(0.\\overline{4} = \\frac{4}{9}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Convert \\(0.\\overline{2}\\) to a Fraction\n- Assume \\(z = 0.\\overline{2}\\).\n- Multiply by 10: \\(10z = 2.\\overline{2}\\).\n- Subtracting, \\(10z - z = 2.\\overline{2} - 0.\\overline{2}\\) results in \\(9z = 2\\).\n- Solving gives \\(z = \\frac{2}{9}\\).\n- This seems accurate. We have \\(0.\\overline{2} = \\frac{2}{9}\\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Expression\n- Alright, now we need to compute: \\(\\frac{7}{9} - \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{2}{9}\\).\n- The fractions have the same denominator, so this should be straightforward.\n- Calculate the numerators: \\(7 - 4 + 2 = 5\\).\n- Therefore, the result is \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\).\n\n### Final Reflection:\n- This expression simplifies nicely, the steps all seem correct, and we\u2019re consistent with the fractions.\n- I don\u2019t suspect any mishaps in the calculations or conversions, as all operations adhered to basic arithmetic rules.\n- I feel confident this is the correct answer: \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nSo, the answer to the original expression \\(0.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{4} + 0.\\overline{2}\\) is \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\) as a common fraction.",

  "ground_truth": "In general, to express the number $0.\\overline{n}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&10x &=& n&.nnnnn\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.nnnnn\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&9x &=& n &\n\\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{n} = \\frac{n}{9}$.\n\nHence, our original problem reduces to computing $\\frac 79 - \\frac 49 + \\frac 29 = \\boxed{\\frac 59}$."
