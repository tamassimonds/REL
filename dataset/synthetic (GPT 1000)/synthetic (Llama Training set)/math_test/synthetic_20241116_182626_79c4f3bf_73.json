    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: Determine the remainder of 194 (mod 11).\n\n### Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\nFirst off, when I hear \"mod 11,\" I'm thinking of finding how much left over we have when dividing by 11. It's like figuring out what day it is if you skip ahead 194 days in a week (a week being 7 days). Here, our \"week\" is 11 days long.\n\nThere's a straightforward method to solve this: simply divide 194 by 11 and look at the remainder. There might be other clever tricks or shortcuts, but let's start with this basic approach because I know it works reliably.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1. **Perform the division:**\n\n    \\[\n    194 \\div 11 \n    \\]\n\n   I want to see how many whole times 11 fits into 194. I'll do this using traditional long division, as it's precise.\n\n2. **Determine how many times 11 can fit into the portions of 194:**\n\n   - 11 goes into the first two digits, 19, and it does so once. 11 x 1 = 11.\n   - Subtracting 11 from 19 leaves us with 8.\n   - Bring down the next digit, 4, making it 84.\n   - Now, 11 goes into 84 seven times. 11 x 7 = 77.\n   - Subtracting 77 from 84 leaves us with a remainder of 7.\n\n   Here\u2019s a check-in moment to ensure everything is flowing:\n\n   - Quotient: 17\n   - Remainder: 7\n\n   So according to this division, our remainder is 7.\n\n3. **Verifying My Result:**\n\n   I want to ensure this is correct by doing a quick multiplication/check:\n\n   - \\(17 \\times 11 = 187\\)\n   - And when I add the remainder, it should add back to 194:\n   - \\(187 + 7 = 194\\)\n\n   This confirms that the division was done correctly. Nice!\n\n### Alternative Methods and Reflections\n\nNow, could there be a quicker way or a trick to check this? Modular arithmetic sometimes allows quick checks by just considering sums or breaking numbers down. For this problem, though, the division gave us what we need cleanly. \n\nIf I were to experiment or check for other ways:\n\n1. **Break it into sums:**   \n\n   - Since \\(194 = 180 + 14\\),\n   - Find \\(180 \\mod 11\\) and \\(14 \\mod 11\\), then add results back together mod 11.\n   - \\(180 \\div 11 = 16\\) with remainder 4,\n   - \\(14 \\div 11 = 1\\) with remainder 3,\n   - Combine: \\((4 + 3) \\mod 11 = 7 \\).\n\n   Same result. Just a different path to the same destination.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe remainder of 194 divided by 11 is 7. Confirming this through division and an alternative check both yield the same answer, which feels solid and reliable. My initial instincts led to a standard method, and exploring another approach was just a deeper reflection. As expected, the mod operation just cycles through numbers effectively, which this problem nicely exemplifies.",
