    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think it through carefully. We need to calculate \\((r - 1)(r + 2)(r + 6)(r + 3)\\), where \\(r\\) is a root of the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + 5x + 7 = 0\\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem.**\n\nFirst, let's consider what is given:\n- \\(r\\) is a root of \\(x^2 + 5x + 7 = 0\\).\n\n**Step 2: Find \\(r\\) using the quadratic formula.**\n\nThe roots of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) are given by:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nFor our equation, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 5\\), and \\(c = 7\\):\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{5^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 7}}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 28}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis calculation shows that the roots are complex:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-5 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the expression \\((r - 1)(r + 2)(r + 6)(r + 3)\\).**\n\nMy initial thought is that for complex roots, there might be some symmetry or specific simplification in this expression. Let's see how this can work out without getting stuck in too much algebra.\n\n**Step 4: Insight about symmetrical properties or simplifications.** \n\nMaybe there is a simplification with product of terms like this. Let me reconsider the quadratic's structure:\n- By Vieta's formulas, for \\(x^2 + 5x + 7 = 0\\), the sum of roots \\(r + s = -5\\), and the product \\(rs = 7\\).\n\nHere, \\(s\\) could be the other root \\(\\frac{-5 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). So \\( r + s = -5 \\).\n\n**Step 5: Verification via substitution back and pattern recognition.**\n\nIt's often a good idea to substitute known formulas or check if there\u2019s a pattern based on how the roots come together. Try substituting \\(x - r = r_a\\) style terms and add up to see:\n\n\\[\n(r - 1)(r + 2)(r + 6)(r + 3) \n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s first regroup:\n- \\((r - 1)(r + 6)\\) and \\((r + 2)(r + 3)\\).\n\n**Step 6: Develop this approach using properties of expressions.**\n\nThese terms can be expanded and consolidated:\n\n\\[\n(r-1)(r+6) = r^2 + 5r - 6 \n\\]\n\\[\n(r+2)(r+3) = r^2 + 5r + 6 \n\\]\n\n**Note:** Oh! That looks interesting. Let me expand:\n- \\((r^2 + 5r - 6)(r^2 + 5r + 6)\\)\n\nNotice, these products simplify as:\n- It forms a difference of squares:  \\((r^2 + 5r)^2 - 36\\).\n\nNow, since \\(r^2 + 5r + 7 = 0\\) from the original quadratic, rearrange this:\n\\[\nr^2 + 5r = -7\n\\]\n\nTherefore, substituting in:\n\\[\n((-7) - 6)((-7) + 6) = 1\\cdot(-13)  = -13\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe value of the expression \\((r - 1)(r + 2)(r + 6)(r + 3)\\), given this setup, is simply \\((1-13) = -36 - 36 = 1- 36 = -13\\).\n\nLet this all sink in, check back if each simplification held sensibly, and ensure that full circle approaches carried through: the systematic approach with polynomials and Vieta-based substitution helped verify from parts, rotations delivering systematic results.\n\nThe answer is \\(-121\\). \n\nIt's always a good hint to work through these proof-style simplifications for deeper algebraic connectivity experiences!\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's take a step back and re-evaluate the problem.\n\nGiven that \\(r\\) is a root of the equation \\(x^2 + 5x + 7 = 0\\), we know that:\n\n\\[ \nr^2 + 5r + 7 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad r^2 + 5r = -7 \n\\]\n\nNow, I've been tasked with finding \\((r - 1)(r + 2)(r + 6)(r + 3)\\). From my previous exploration, I found:\n\n\\[ \n(r - 1)(r + 6) = r^2 + 5r - 6 \n\\]\n\\[ \n(r + 2)(r + 3) = r^2 + 5r + 6 \n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply these two expressions, we use the identity \\((a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2\\):\n\n\\[\n(r^2 + 5r - 6)(r^2 + 5r + 6) = (r^2 + 5r)^2 - 6^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(r^2 + 5r = -7\\) into the equation transforms it into:\n\n\\[\n(-7)^2 - 36 = 49 - 36\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n13\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\((r - 1)(r + 2)(r + 6)(r + 3)\\) is indeed \\(\\boxed{13}\\).\n\nRevisiting the approach and verifying the expressions ensured a clearer path and rectified my earlier calculation error. The strategy of using the properties of quadratic roots and careful algebraic manipulation has led to the correct result.",
