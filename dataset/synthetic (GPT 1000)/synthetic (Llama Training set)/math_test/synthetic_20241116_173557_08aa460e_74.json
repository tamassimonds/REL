    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into simplifying the expression \\((\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{24})^2\\). \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nWhen I first look at this expression, it reminds me of a perfect square pattern, specifically the square of a binomial. The form \\((a + b)^2\\) expands to \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So my initial thought is to use this pattern to simplify the expression further. The immediate task is to identify \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) here, which are \\(\\sqrt{6}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{24}\\) respectively.\n\n### Brainstorming Approaches\n\n1. **Expanding the Expression**: Use the binomial expansion formula to simplify.\n2. **Simplifying Surds**: Before expansion, simplify \\(\\sqrt{24}\\) if possible. \\(\\sqrt{24}\\) can be written in a simpler form because it's not fully simplified yet.\n\nHmm, I think I should start with simplifying \\(\\sqrt{24}\\) first because simpler terms might make the expansion easier. \n\n### Simplifying \\(\\sqrt{24}\\)\n\nThe square root of 24 can be broken down into \\(\\sqrt{24} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 6} = \\sqrt{4} \\times \\sqrt{6} = 2\\sqrt{6}\\). \n\nOh, that makes things nicer because now instead of working with two different surds, I'm working with similar terms: \\(\\sqrt{6} + 2\\sqrt{6}\\). \n\n### Re-writing the Expression\n\nThus, \\(\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{24}\\) becomes \\(\\sqrt{6} + 2\\sqrt{6} = 3\\sqrt{6}\\).\n\n### Expanding \\((3\\sqrt{6})^2\\)\n\nLet's expand using the perfect square formula:\n\n\\[\n(3\\sqrt{6})^2 = (3\\sqrt{6}) \\cdot (3\\sqrt{6})\n\\]\n\nCalculating each step:\n\n- \\(3 \\cdot 3 = 9\\)\n- \\(\\sqrt{6} \\cdot \\sqrt{6} = 6\\)\n\nSo, multiplying these, we get:\n\n\\[\n9 \\times 6 = 54\n\\]\n\n### Verifying and Reflecting\n\nWow, that simplifies nicely to 54. It seems quite reasonable because after simplifying \\(\\sqrt{24}\\) to \\(2\\sqrt{6}\\), we were able to consolidate like terms.\n\nQuick check: \n- Initial thoughts check out; using perfect square expansion was the way to go. \n- Simplifying \\(\\sqrt{24}\\) benefitted the overall simplification.\n- The work seems correct since each calculation followed logically. \n\nReflecting on this, it turned into a straightforward problem once the surds were simplified. Perhaps next time, when spotting any square roots, I'll first consider if they can be split into simpler multiples\u2014this substantially streamlined the problem this time around.\n\nThus, the simplified expression \\((\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{24})^2\\) evaluates to 54.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we simplify $\\sqrt{24}$ by noting that $24 = 4\\cdot 6$, so $\\sqrt{24} = \\sqrt{4}\\cdot \\sqrt{6} = 2\\sqrt{6}$.  Therefore, we have $\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{24} = \\sqrt{6} + 2\\sqrt{6} = 3\\sqrt{6}$, so  $$(\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{24})^2 = (3\\sqrt{6})^2 = 3^2 \\cdot(\\sqrt{6})^2 = 9\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{54}.$$"
