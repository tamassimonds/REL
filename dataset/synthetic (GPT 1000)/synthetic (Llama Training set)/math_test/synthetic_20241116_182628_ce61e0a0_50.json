    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step and really think it through together. \n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given that the sum of the squares of three consecutive positive even numbers equals 12,296. Our task is to find the product of these three numbers and then divide that product by 8.\n\n### First Thoughts\n- Consecutive even numbers remind me of sequences like \\( x, x+2, x+4 \\). So, that might be useful here.\n- The problem of squaring and summing also touches on algebraic identities and simplifications. Could this be reduced further in a way to express it algebraically?\n\n### Step 2: Define Variables\nLet\u2019s define the three consecutive even numbers:\n- First number: \\( x \\)\n- Second number: \\( x + 2 \\)\n- Third number: \\( x + 4 \\)\n\n### Step 3: Write an Equation\nUsing the variable \\( x \\), we can express the sum of their squares:\n\\[\nx^2 + (x+2)^2 + (x+4)^2 = 12296\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Expand and Simplify\nLet's expand and simplify the equation:\n\\[\nx^2 + (x^2 + 4x + 4) + (x^2 + 8x + 16) = 12296\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n3x^2 + 12x + 20 = 12296\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplify Further\nIt seems quite large, but let\u2019s subtract 20 from both sides:\n\\[\n3x^2 + 12x = 12276\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Check Simplification\nFirst check: Divide entire equation by 3:\n\\[\nx^2 + 4x = 4092\n\\]\n\nUmm, something feels wrong... actually, let's slow down here.\n\n### Step 7: Trial and Error Approach\n- Perhaps using trial and error could help us verify the range or starting point for x.\n- Use \\( x = 40 \\), a reasonable guess to get a sense of it:\n\\[\n40^2 + 42^2 + 44^2\n\\]\n\\[\n1600 + 1764 + 1936 = 5300 \\quad \\text{(clearly too small!)}\n\\]\n- Increase \\( x \\) to see if we're on track. Wow, big leap to check: \\( x = 64 \\):\n\\[\n64^2 + 66^2 + 68^2\n\\]\n\\[\n4096 + 4356 + 4624 = 13076 \\quad \\text{(overshot)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Narrow Down and Confirm\nThis tells us: \\( x \\) is between 60 and 64. Let's iterate again:\n- Try \\( x = 62 \\):\n\\[\n62^2 + 64^2 + 66^2\n\\]\n\\[\n3844 + 4096 + 4356 = 12296 \\]\n\n**Perfect match!** So, \\( x = 62 \\).\n\n### Step 9: Calculate Product\nCalculate the product of these numbers:\n- 62, 64, 66\n- Product: \\( 62 \\times 64 \\times 66 \\)\n\nLet's compute the product carefully:\n- Start with smaller multiplication: \\( 62 \\times 64 \\)\n- \\( 62 \\times 64 = 3968 \\)\n- \\((3968 \\times 66 = 261888)\\) by standard multiplication check:\n  \\[\n  3968 \\times (60 + 6) \\implies 3968 \\times 60 + 3968 \\times 6\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 238080 + 23808 = 261888\n  \\]\n\n### Step 10: Final Calculation\nDivide by 8:\n\\[\n\\frac{261888}{8} = 32736\n\\]\n\nAnd there we have it, checked and confirmed throughout. Our answer is \\(\\boxed{32736}\\). \n\nThis feels correct after multiple verifications and simplifying iterative steps.",

  "ground_truth": "If $n$ is the middle number of the three, the other two numbers are $n-2$ and $n+2$. Therefore, the squares are $n^2-4n+4$, $n^2$, and $n^2+4n+4$. Setting the sum of the three squares equal to $12296$, \\begin{align*}\n\\left(n^2-4n+4\\right)+\\left(n^2\\right)+\\left(n^2+4n+4\\right)&=12296\\\\\n3n^2+8&=12296\\\\\n3n^2&=12288\\\\\nn^2&=4096\\\\\nn&=\\pm64\n\\end{align*}Because $n$ is positive, $n$ must be $64$. Therefore, the set of numbers is $62, 64, 66$. The product of those is $261888$. The product divided by 8 is $\\boxed{32736}$."
