    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by thinking out loud and going through a process that's natural and exploratory.\n\n### Understanding the Problem:\nWe need to evaluate \\( f(g(1)) \\) given the functions \\( f(x) = x^3 + 2x + 1 \\) and \\( g(x) = x - 1 \\).\n\nHmm, so what does that mean? Well, it looks like we're dealing with function composition. When I see something like \\( f(g(1)) \\), it initially reminds me of plugging one function into another, kind of like peeling layers off an onion.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\nOkay, let's break it down step-by-step. My goal here is to first evaluate \\( g(1) \\) and use that result in \\( f(x) \\). The key is to approach this methodically, checking each step.\n\nLet's start with \\( g(x) = x - 1 \\). So if I'm plugging in \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\[ g(1) = 1 - 1 = 0 \\]\n\nThat was straightforward. I feel confident that \\( g(1) = 0 \\) is correct.\n\n### Next Steps:\nNow that I know \\( g(1) \\), my job is to evaluate \\( f(g(1)) = f(0) \\).\n\nThis means I take \\( f(x) = x^3 + 2x + 1 \\) and substitute \\( x = 0 \\).\n\n\\[ f(0) = 0^3 + 2(0) + 1 \\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ f(0) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \\]\n\nThis seems to work. It's a simple calculation, but let\u2019s quickly check if these computations make sense.\n\n### Reflection and Verification:\n- **Double-checking \\( g(1) \\):** \\( g(1) = 1 - 1 = 0 \\). Yes, still correct.\n- **Double-checking \\( f(0) \\):** Plugging into \\( f(x) = x^3 + 2x + 1 \\) with \\( x = 0 \\) gives \\( 1 \\). Confirming that I computed this correctly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe value of \\( f(g(1)) \\) is \\( 1 \\).\n\nOverall, the process flowed smoothly beginning from understanding the question, evaluating \\( g(1) \\), and finally evaluating \\( f(0) \\). Each step seems coherent and logically correct. \n\nReflecting on this, the key was identifying the quick steps involved in function composition, which I initially thought could be tricky but turned out to be fairly direct once broken down. \ud83c\udf89",
