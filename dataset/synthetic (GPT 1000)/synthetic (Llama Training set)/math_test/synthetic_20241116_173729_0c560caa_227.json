    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\nLooking at the problem, I need to simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{27}{30}\\). This means I should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator, and divide both by that number. At first glance, I recall dealing with simplifying fractions, and it typically involves identifying prime numbers or common factors.\n\nBrainstorming strategies:\n\n1. **Factorization Strategy**: Break down both the numerator (27) and the denominator (30) into their prime factors to identify common factors. Common factors can help in simplifying the fraction.\n\n2. **Euclidean Algorithm**: Use this to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 27 and 30 quickly. This might be more straightforward than listing factors.\n\n3. **Observation Method**: Sometimes quickly observing that both numbers might be divisible by a small number like 3 or 5 could speed up simplification.\n\nLet's start with factorization:\n\n1. **Factor 27**: \n   - 27 is \\(3 \\times 9\\), and 9 is \\(3 \\times 3\\). Thus, \\(27 = 3^3\\).\n\n2. **Factor 30**:\n   - 30 is \\(2 \\times 15\\), and 15 is \\(3 \\times 5\\). Thus, \\(30 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5\\).\n\nNow, I see that both 27 and 30 share the factor 3. This suggests that 3 could be a common factor to simplify the fraction, but let\u2019s still determine if it\u2019s the greatest common factor.\n\n3. **Calculate GCD using the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - Divide 30 by 27: \\(30 \\div 27 = 1\\) with a remainder of 3.\n   - Divide 27 by 3: \\(27 \\div 3 = 9\\) with no remainder.\n   - GCD is the non-zero remainder, so GCD(27, 30) is 3.\n\nWith GCD confirmed as 3, I can simplify:\n\n4. **Simplify the fraction**:\n   - Divide both numerator and denominator by 3:\n   - \\(\\frac{27}{3} = 9\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{30}{3} = 10\\)\n\n5. **Simplified fraction**: \\(\\frac{9}{10}\\)\n\nQuick reflection: \n\nThis result makes sense because I found the GCD correctly and divided both numbers by it. The fraction \\(\\frac{9}{10}\\) seems simplified as 9 and 10 do not have common factors other than 1. Thus, the approach was correct. \n\nThat number seems appropriate because 9 and 10 are consecutive numbers, thus they should typically have no common factors other than 1. Let me now try to think of why my approach made sense.\n\nReflection:\n\nIn simplifying fractions, correctly finding the GCD and dividing out common factors is typically the best approach. My initial thoughts on using factorization and the Euclidean Algorithm helped confirm the greatest common factor of 3, leading to a correctly simplified fraction. I\u2019m confident the steps taken were logical and consistent, checking my work as I progressed ensured accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the simplified fraction of \\(\\frac{27}{30}\\) is \\(\\frac{9}{10}\\).",
