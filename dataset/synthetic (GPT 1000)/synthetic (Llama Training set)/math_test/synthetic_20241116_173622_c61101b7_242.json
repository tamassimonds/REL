    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, and I'll really let myself think out loud and show you my messy and hopefully insightful process.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- **First Impressions**: Okay, so Morgan has a total of shirts of different types: hockey, football, and baseball. The question is asking for the probability that a randomly selected shirt is not a baseball shirt. Hmm, I have a feeling this involves basic probability principles, but let\u2019s dissect it carefully.\n  \n- **Looking for Comparisons**: This kind of reminds me of problems where we calculate probabilities by subtracting the probability of what we don\u2019t want from 1.\n\n- **Uncertainty**: I\u2019m not entirely sure if I should focus on just counting the types or if there's any trick to be aware of. But probability usually boils down to favorable outcomes over total outcomes, right?\n\n### Brainstorming Steps\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Shirts**:\n   - **Hockey shirts**: There are 3.\n   - **Football shirts**: There are 2.\n   - **Baseball shirts**: There are 7.\n   - **Total shirts**: \\(3 + 2 + 7 = 12\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Outcome we don't want**:\n   - We are interested in the shirts that are *not* baseball shirts.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Non-Baseball Shirts**:\n   - **Non-baseball shirts**: Hockey + Football = \\(3 + 2 = 5\\).\n\n### Formulating a Strategy\n\n- **Probability Calculation**: \n  We need the probability that Morgan picks a non-baseball shirt. From basic probability:  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Probability of event} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}}\n  \\]\n\n- **In Our Case**:\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Not a baseball shirt}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of non-baseball shirts}}{\\text{Total number of shirts}} = \\frac{5}{12}\n  \\]\n\n### Reflection and Checking\n\n- **Quick Check**: Does \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\) make sense? Let's see:\n  - The complement probability, which is picking a baseball shirt, should be \\( \\frac{7}{12} \\) since there are 7 baseball shirts. \n  - Together, \\(\\frac{5}{12} + \\frac{7}{12} = 1\\), which balances perfectly with the total probability.\n\n- **Sense Test**: The non-baseball shirts consist of fewer numbers (5) than baseball shirts (7), so a probability of \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\) feels sensible for the smaller group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Final Thought**: The method feels correct, and the probability \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\) for selecting a non-baseball shirt checks out logically and mathematically. It all adds up!\n\nWriting all this out like a train of thought helps confirm the approach is sound. It\u2019s nice to see that thinking through it patiently aligns with basic probability rules.",

  "ground_truth": "There are $3+2 + 7 =12$ shirts to choose from. A total of $2+3 = 5$ of these, all the hockey and football shirts, are not baseball shirts. So, the probability of not getting a baseball shirt is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}$."
