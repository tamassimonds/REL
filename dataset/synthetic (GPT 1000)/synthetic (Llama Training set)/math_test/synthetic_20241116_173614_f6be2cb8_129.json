    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle the problem of computing \\(91^2\\). I\u2019ll walk through this with careful thought and exploration of strategies.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Thoughts\n\n- **Familiarity**: This looks a bit like squaring numbers close to 100. I feel like this might be similar to something I\u2019ve heard about using shortcuts for numbers near 100, but I\u2019m not entirely sure.\n- **First Impressions**: Squaring \\(91\\) directly seems a bit tough without any immediate strategic thought. I might need a few tricks or formulas I\u2019ve used before.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring Strategies\n\n1. **Direct Multiplication**: \n   - Calculate \\(91 \\times 91\\) directly. Honestly, this seems cumbersome to do in my head, especially getting the intermediate steps right.\n\n2. **Using the formula for squaring binomials**:\n   - I can express \\(91\\) as \\((90 + 1)\\), which gives a clue to use the expansion \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n3. **Considering Complements and Base Numbers**:\n   - I know for numbers close to 100, there\u2019s a method involving complements.\n   - Specifically, \\(91\\) is \\(9\\) less than \\(100\\). So there might be something here using that fact.\n\n### Step 3: Applying Strategy\n\nLet\u2019s try the formula first since it feels most straightforward.\n\n1. **Using the formula \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) with \\(a = 90\\) and \\(b = 1\\)**:\n\n   - Calculate \\(a^2 = 90^2\\):\n     - \\(90^2 = (9 \\times 10)^2 = 81 \\times 100 = 8100\\). Makes sense since \\(90\\) is significantly closer to \\(100\\), it\u2019s like taking \\(9^2\\) and shifting it.\n     - Check: \\(81 \\times 100\\) feels right. Good so far!\n\n   - Calculate \\(2ab = 2 \\times 90 \\times 1 = 180\\).\n\n   - Calculate \\(b^2 = 1^2 = 1\\).\n\n2. **Add them up**:\n   - \\(91^2 = 8100 + 180 + 1 = 8281\\).\n\n### Step 4: Reflecting on the Answer\n\n- **Quick Check**: \n  - \\(91\\) being \\(9\\) less than \\(100\\) means the square should be close but less than \\(10000\\).\n  - Okay, \\(8281\\) feels like a reasonable answer given that difference.\n\n- **Solution Validate**: \n  - I trust the expansion method, especially when checked step-wise. Seems correct!\n  - I\u2019ll quickly think whether there\u2019s a more intuitive way or if these steps feel solid\u2014oh, realizing the base method may recheck \\(100 - 9 \\times (100 - 9) = 8281\\), also validated through steps.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n- **Satisfaction**: This seems like a balanced approach with manageable arithmetic.\n- **Realization**: I remembered the base/complement method and checked with the binomial formula as a fallback; both assured that \\(8281\\) is the result.\n\nThis process really helped me structure the problem logically and ensured I didn't rush through steps without understanding them.",
