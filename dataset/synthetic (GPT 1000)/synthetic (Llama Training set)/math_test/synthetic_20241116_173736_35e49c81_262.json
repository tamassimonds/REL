    "working_out": "**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts: We need to find the length of the longest side of the triangle with given vertices. The problem seems familiar to finding distances between points in a coordinate plane, which involves the distance formula. Let's brainstorm a few strategies: \n\n- Calculate the distance between each pair of vertices.\n- Use the distance formula to measure each side of the triangle.\n- Compare all the side lengths to identify the longest one.\n\nThis feels straightforward, but I need to stay attentive to calculations to avoid errors. \n\n**Step 2: Applying the Distance Formula**\n\nWe have three vertices: \\(A(11, 1)\\), \\(B(2, 3)\\), and \\(C(3, 7)\\). Let's calculate the lengths of sides \\(AB\\), \\(BC\\), and \\(CA\\).\n\n**Step 3: Calculating Side Lengths**\n\n1. **Length of \\(AB\\):**\n   - Use the distance formula: \n     \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\)\n   - Substitute: \\(A(11, 1)\\) and \\(B(2, 3)\\):\n     \\[\n     AB = \\sqrt{(2 - 11)^2 + (3 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{(-9)^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{81 + 4} = \\sqrt{85}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Length of \\(BC\\):**\n   - Substitute: \\(B(2, 3)\\) and \\(C(3, 7)\\):\n     \\[\n     BC = \\sqrt{(3 - 2)^2 + (7 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 16} = \\sqrt{17}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Length of \\(CA\\):**\n   - Substitute: \\(C(3, 7)\\) and \\(A(11, 1)\\):\n     \\[\n     CA = \\sqrt{(11 - 3)^2 + (1 - 7)^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n     \\]\n\nLet's pause and reflect: These calculations seem reasonable. I should compare these lengths to find the longest side.\n\n**Step 4: Comparing Side Lengths**\n\nWe've calculated:\n- \\(AB = \\sqrt{85}\\)\n- \\(BC = \\sqrt{17}\\)\n- \\(CA = 10\\)\n\nObviously, \\(\\sqrt{85}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{17}\\) are complex to check by sight, but since \\(\\sqrt{85}\\) is slightly more than 9 (because \\(9^2 = 81\\)), and \\(CA = 10\\), it seems correct that \\(CA\\) is the longest.\n\n**Check**\n\n- Confirm previous calculations: All are re-checked and correct.\n- Logical check: Side \\(CA\\) seems longest based on both math and logical assessment.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of units in the length of the longest side is \\(10\\). Let's wrap up by reflecting on steps taken and verifying each makes sense in achieving the solution.\n\nThis has been a step-by-step, analytical approach. Everything checks out, and hence the answer \\(10\\) is consistent and correct.",

  "ground_truth": "We must find the distance between each pair of points by using the distance formula.\n\nThe distance between $(11, 1)$ and $(2, 3)$ is $\\sqrt{(11 - 2)^2 + (1 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{81 + 4} = \\sqrt{85}$.\n\nThe distance between $(2, 3)$ and $(3, 7)$ is $\\sqrt{(2 - 3)^2 + (3- 7)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 16} = \\sqrt{17}$.\n\nThe distance between $(3, 7)$ and $(11, 1)$ is $\\sqrt{(11 - 3)^2 + (1- 7)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\sqrt{100} = 10$.\n\n$10$ is larger than $\\sqrt{85}$ and $\\sqrt{17}$. Thus, the longest side of the triangle has length $\\boxed{10}$."
