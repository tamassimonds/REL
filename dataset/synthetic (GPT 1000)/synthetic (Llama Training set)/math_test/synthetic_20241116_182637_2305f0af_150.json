    "working_out": "When I tackle a problem like this, the first step is to break it down and understand what's being asked. Here, I have a number, \\( x = 735 \\), and I want to find a value \\( a \\), such that when multiplied by \\( x \\) (i.e., \\( ax \\)), the result is a perfect square. Moreover, I need to determine the smallest possible value of \\( \\sqrt{ax} \\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Perfect Square Requirement:**  \n   Since \\( ax \\) must be a perfect square, \\( a \\times 735 \\) needs to have all prime factors raised to even powers. This means I should start by finding the prime factorization of 735 to see what factors might be missing.\n\n2. **Find a Strategy:**\n   A logical starting approach is to factorize 735:\n   \n   \\[ 735 = 5 \\times 147 \\]\n   \\[ 147 = 3 \\times 49 \\]\n   \\[ 49 = 7 \\times 7 \\]\n\n   So the factorization is:\n   \\[ 735 = 5 \\times 3 \\times 7^2 \\]\n\n3. **Analyzing the Factors:**\n   To make 735 a perfect square, I need each prime factor to have an even exponent.\n   - 5 and 3 appear with an exponent of 1, which needs to be 2.\n   - 7 is already squared (exponent is 2), so it's fine.\n\n4. **Determine \\( a \\):**\n   - To get an even exponent for 5, I need one more 5, so a factor of 5.\n   - To get an even exponent for 3, I need one more 3, so a factor of 3.\n\n   Thus, \\( a \\) must be at least \\( 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\).\n\n5. **Check if This Works:**\n   Let's verify that multiplying:\n   \\[ a = 15 \\]\n   \\[ ax = 15 \\times 735 = 11025 \\]\n\n   \\( 11025 \\) should be a perfect square.\n\n6. **Checking if 11025 is a Perfect Square:**\n   If 11025 is a perfect square, \\( \\sqrt{11025} \\) should be an integer. Let's find \\(\\sqrt{11025}\\).\n\n7. **Calculating \\(\\sqrt{11025}\\):**\n   The prime factorization of 11025 should confirm it's a perfect square:\n   \n   \\[ 11025 = 3^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^2 \\]\n\n   The square root of each part is:\n   - \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\)\n   - \\(\\sqrt{5^2} = 5\\)\n   - \\(\\sqrt{7^2} = 7\\)\n\n   So, the complete product:\n   \\[ \\sqrt{11025} = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 105 \\]\n\n**Reflections and Verification:**\n\n- This checks out, as \\( \\sqrt{ax} = 105 \\) is indeed an integer, confirming that \\( 11025 \\) is a perfect square.\n- The choice of \\( a = 15 \\) to make the product a perfect square was minimal.\n- After reviewing the steps and calculations, everything seems to be logically sound and checks out mathematically.\n\nThus, the smallest possible value of \\(\\sqrt{ax}\\) is \\( 105 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "First we find the prime factorization of 735, which is $3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7^2$. In order to make a perfect square, we need another factor of 3 and another factor of 5. So if $a=15$, we have $ax=(3\\cdot5)(3\\cdot5\\cdot7^2)=3^2\\cdot5^2\\cdot7^2$. That means $\\sqrt{ax}=3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{105}$."
