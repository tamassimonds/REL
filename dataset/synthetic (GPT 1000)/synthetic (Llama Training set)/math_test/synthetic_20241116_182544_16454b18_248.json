    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. \n\n**First Impressions:**\n\nWhen I first see the system of equations:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = 5 \\]\n\\[ 3xy + x + y = 4 \\]\n\nMy initial thought is that it looks like a problem involving symmetric expressions or potentially transformations might help. There's definitely a hint that the relationships between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) could be exploited due to the symmetry of the sum and product form. \n\n**Step 1 - Analyze the given equations:**\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{x+y}{xy} = 5 \\]\n\nSo, I can rewrite it as:\n\\[ x + y = 5xy \\]\n\nThis gives us a new expression to work with, which could simplify things later on.\n\n**Step 2 - Re-examine the second equation:**\n\nThe second equation is:\n\\[ 3xy + x + y = 4 \\]\n\nWe can now use the expression for \\(x+y\\) that we found:\n\\[ 3xy + 5xy = 4 \\]\n\\[ 8xy = 4 \\]\n\nOkay, something looks off \u2013 it should simplify easier. I must have made a miscalculation. Hmm, let me check...\n\n**Combining Equations:**\n\nActually, I need to combine them more systematically. Given:\n\\[ x + y = 5xy \\]\n\nSubstitute in the second equation:\n\\[ 3xy + x + y = 4 \\rightarrow 3xy + 5xy = 4 \\]\n\\[ 8xy = 4 \\]\n\nNow, that seems right. Solving for \\(xy\\) gives:\n\\[ xy = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\n**Step 3 - Check new insights**\n\nWith \\(x+y = 5xy\\) and \\(xy = \\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\\[ x + y = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\nGreat! We have:\n\\[ x+y = \\frac{5}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad xy = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nNow, looking back at the expression \\(x^2y + xy^2\\), this is symmetric in terms of multiplication of powers, which makes me think of using:\n\\[ x^2y + xy^2 = xy(x + y) \\]\n\nLet's plug in the values we've calculated:\n\\[ xy \\times (x+y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{5}{4} \\]\n\n**Final Check and Reflection:**\n\nDid I handle every part correctly? It looks like I've correctly identified:\n\n1. The values from each step stayed consistent.\n2. By combining and simplifying correctly, there's coherence.\n\nThe final expression makes logical sense given the formulation of the problem \u2013 using common polynomial symmetry. \n\nSo, the solution is:\n\\[ x^2y + xy^2 = \\frac{5}{4} \\]\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis structured approach, gradually unfolding the connections between the given equations, confirms the solution. Using \\(xy(x+y)\\) was a productive simplification, showing a clear interplay between the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y.\\)",

  "ground_truth": "The first equation becomes\n\n$$\\frac{x+y}{xy}=5\\Rightarrow x+y=5xy.$$\n\nSubstituting into the second equation,\n\n$$8xy=4\\Rightarrow xy=\\frac{1}{2}.$$\n\nThus $x+y=\\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nThe quantity we desire factors as $xy(x+y)$, so it is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{4}}$."
