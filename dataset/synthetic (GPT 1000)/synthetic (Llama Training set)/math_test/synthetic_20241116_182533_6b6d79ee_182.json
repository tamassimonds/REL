    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this. The problem asks for the $2007^{\\text{th}}$ digit in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{7}$. Here's how I approach problems like this:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts here: I know $\\frac{1}{7}$ results in a repeating decimal. I remember from some math classes that fractions with a denominator that\u2019s a prime number (like 7) often have interesting repeating patterns.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Decimal Expansion of $\\frac{1}{7}$\n\nOkay, let's calculate $\\frac{1}{7}$ and see what we get. \n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{7} = 0.142857142857... \\]\n\nThe decimal expansion is repeating: $0.\\overline{142857}$. This confirms my memory: $\\frac{1}{7}$ has a repeating pattern of six digits: 142857.\n\nQuick check: If I multiply 142857 by 7, I should get a number very close to 1, if the expansion and pattern are correct. Let's try:\n\n\\[ 142857 \\times 7 = 999999 \\]\n\nThat's really close to 1000000, confirming 0.142857 is indeed the correct repeating cycle.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Position of the 2007th Digit\n\nNow, I need the $2007^{\\text{th}}$ digit in this repeating pattern. \n\n**Thoughts here:** I know the repeating part is six digits long, so I should divide 2007 by 6 to determine how far it goes in the cycle.\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n\\[ 2007 \\div 6 = 334 \\text{ remainder } 3 \\]\n\nSo, 2007 consists of 334 complete cycles of \"142857\" with 3 digits into the next cycle.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the 2007th Digit\n\nSince 334 full cycles are completed, that takes up $334 \\times 6 = 2004$ digits. We need the third digit of the sequence after 2004 digits.\n\nLet's consider the digits in the repeating cycle \"142857\":\n\n1. 1\n2. 4\n3. 2\n4. 8\n5. 5\n6. 7\n\nFrom this, I can see the third digit in \"142857\" is 2.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo, the $2007^{\\text{th}}$ digit in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is **2**.\n\n**Check:** Reflecting on the process, everything seems consistent. Was there any part I could simplify further? The division and reasoning align with the repeating cycle strategy for periodic decimals. That seems correct, so I'm confident the answer is 2. \n\nThis problem was a nice reminder of how repeating decimal cycles work and how division can help pinpoint specific digits in extended expansions.",

  "ground_truth": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$, which repeats every six digits. Since 2007 divided by 6 has a remainder of 3, the $2007^{\\text{th}}$ digit is the same as the third digit after the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{2}$."
