    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step, exploring and reflecting on different strategies as we go.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst thoughts: \n- We have 12 people, and we need to group them into three groups: a group of 3, a group of 4, and a group of 5. \n- There's a special condition: Henry must be in the group of 4.\n- This type of problem seems familiar, akin to problems in combinatorics where we're dealing with partitioning sets.\n- I\u2019m thinking about how constraints like \"Henry must be in group 4\" can affect the total count.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n1. **Direct Partitioning:**\n   - Start with selecting people for each group, ensuring Henry is in the group of 4.\n   \n2. **Counting Without Constraints, Then Adjust:**\n   - Count all groupings then adjust for Henry being in the group of 4 later.\n\n3. **Fix Henry First, then Partition:**\n   - Place Henry in his group first, then figure out the rest for the two other groups.\n\nThe third option seems reasonable because it directly considers the constraint from the start. Let's try that.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Fix Henry in Group of 4:**\n   - Identify that by fixing Henry, we have essentially a problem of placing the remaining 11 people into groups of 3 and 5 alongside Henry's group of 3 others.\n\n2. **Choose Members for Henry's Group (Group of 4):**\n   - Since Henry is already in this group, we need to choose 3 more people out of the remaining 11 to join him.\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 people out of 11 is calculated using combinations:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 165\n     \\]\n\n3. **Choose Group of 5:**\n   - After choosing 3 for Henry's group, 8 people are left.\n   - Choose 5 people from those 8 to form the second group.\n   - The number of ways to choose 5 people out of 8 is:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{8}{5} = \\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\n     \\]\n   - Here, using \\(\\binom{8}{3} = \\binom{8}{5}\\) because choosing who to include is the same as choosing who to exclude.\n\n4. **Group of 3:**\n   - The remaining 3 people automatically form the last group.\n   - There's only 1 way to group the remaining individuals.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Combinations:**\n   - Total number of ways = (ways to choose group of 4) \u00d7 (ways to choose group of 5)\n   - \\[\n   165 \\times 56 = 9240\n   \\]\n\n### Reflecting and Checking\n- Each step seems to align with combinatorial principles.\n- Quick check: Multiplying \\(165\\) by \\(56\\) is a reasonable step considering the splitting strategy used.\n- Thought: The constraints were addressed upfront, and each selection followed logically from constraints. \n- Sanity Check: Natural restrictions in choosing mean no steps are extraneous.\n\n### Conclusion\n- The total number of ways to partition the 12 people under the given constraints is 9240.\n- Reflecting, this approach ensures all considerations for group size and constraints were factored in.\n- Feel confident about the solution, but breaking down and rechecking each component is always a good habit in combinatorial problems.\n\nI've documented each intuitive twist and turn, showing reasoning and logical flow \u2013 it\u2019s always fun to break these problems down and discover the most efficient route!",

  "ground_truth": "If Henry is in the group of 4, there are $\\binom{11}{3}=165$ ways to choose the other people in the group of 4. Then there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways to choose the group of 3, and the group of 5 is made up of the remaining people. The total number of valid ways to divide the people into groups is $165\\cdot 56=\\boxed{9240}$."
