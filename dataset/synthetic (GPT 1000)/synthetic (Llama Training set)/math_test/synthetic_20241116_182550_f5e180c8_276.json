    "working_out": "Alright, let me dive into this problem systematically. First, I'll try to understand what's happening conceptually and then I'll move on to the calculations.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n- We have a rectangular aquarium with a base of 100 cm by 40 cm.\n- The height of the aquarium is 50 cm, and initially, water is filled to a depth of 37 cm.\n- We need to determine how much the water level increases when a rock with a volume of 1000 cm\u00b3 is submerged into the aquarium.\n\n**Brainstorming Solutions:**\n- The key factor here is the displacement of water. When the rock is submerged in water, it displaces an amount of water equivalent to its own volume.\n- We can use the formula of volume \\( Volume = Length \\times Width \\times Height \\) to find the height increase caused by the displaced water.\n\n**Initial Approach:**\n1. Calculate the current volume of water in the aquarium before the rock is added.\n2. Calculate how the volume of the rock affects the water level.\n3. Determine the new water level by adding the height displaced by the rock to the initial water depth.\n\nLet's start with step-by-step calculations.\n\n**Step 1: Current Volume of Water**\n- The base of the aquarium is 100 cm by 40 cm, and the water is filled to a depth of 37 cm.\n- The volume of the water currently in the aquarium is:\n  \\[\n  Volume_{\\text{current water}} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{height}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 100 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 40 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 37 \\, \\text{cm} = 148,000 \\, \\text{cm}^3\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Volume Displacement by the Rock**\n- The rock displaces water equal to its volume, which is 1000 cm\u00b3.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Water Level Rise**\n- The water will rise an amount equal to the height needed to accommodate an additional volume of 1000 cm\u00b3 within the base area of the aquarium.\n- To find the increase in water level, we can rearrange the volume formula to solve for height:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Volume displaced} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{height increase}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  1000 \\, \\text{cm}^3 = 100 \\, \\text{cm} \\times 40 \\, \\text{cm} \\times \\text{height increase}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Height increase} = \\frac{1000}{100 \\times 40} = \\frac{1000}{4000} = 0.25 \\, \\text{cm}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection and Verification:**\n- Let's verify if our calculated water rise, 0.25 cm, seems reasonable. The base area is quite large (4000 cm\u00b2), so a volume of 1000 cm\u00b3 causing a 0.25 cm rise seems plausible. The logic checks out when considering typical volume displacements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The water level rises by **0.25 cm** when the rock is fully submerged, bringing the water level from 37 cm to 37.25 cm.\n\nThis feels like a simple problem of volume displacement, and all calculations align with expected physical principles. I\u2019m confident in this solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Using the volume formula $lwh = V$, the volume of water in the aquarium is $100 \\times 40 \\times 37 = 148{,}000\n\\text{ cm}^3$. When the rock is put in, the water and the rock will occupy a box-shaped region with volume $148{,}000 + 1000 = 149{,}000\n\\text{ cm}^3$. The volume of the water and the rock is $100 \\times 40\n\\times h$, where $h$ is the new height of the water. $\\text{The new\nvolume} = 4000h = 149{,}000 \\text{ cm}^3$, so the new height is $$h=\\frac{149000}{4000}=37.25 \\text{ cm}.$$After adding the rock, the water rises $37.25-37=\\boxed{0.25\\text{ cm}}$.\n\n\\[ OR \\]Because the shape of the rock is irrelevant, we may assume that the rock is shaped like a rectangular box with base measuring $100\n\\text{ cm} \\times 40 \\text{ cm}$ and height $h$ cm. Using the volume formula, $100 \\times 40 \\times h =1000$, so $h =\n\\frac{1000}{100\\times 40}=0.25 \\text{ cm}$. When the rock is put into the aquarium, the water level will rise by $\\boxed{0.25\\,\\text{ cm}}$."
