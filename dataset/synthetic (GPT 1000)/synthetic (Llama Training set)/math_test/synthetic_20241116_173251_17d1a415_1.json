    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\nFirst thoughts: Okay, we have five locations and Mary can only choose to visit three. This seems like a combination problem because the order in which she visits the locations doesn\u2019t matter. It reminds me of a basic problem from combinatorics where you select a subset from a larger set.\n\nLet's start with brainstorming different strategies:\n\n1. **Listing all Choices:**\n   - My first thought is to list out all the combinations. I can start writing down the possible sets of three locations chosen from five. But quickly, I realize this might be tedious and error-prone without a systematic approach. Hmm, maybe I should try something else since it's not efficient to write them all out manually for every larger problem.\n\n2. **Using Combinatorics Formula:**\n   - There\u2019s a formula for combinations: \\(\\binom{n}{r}\\) which equals \\(\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\\). Here, \\(n\\) is the total number of items to choose from (5 in this case), and \\(r\\) is the number of items to choose (3 here). This seems familiar and straightforward.\n\n   - I\u2019ll use this method first since it\u2019s quicker and avoids listing all possibilities.\n\nLet's calculate:\n- Start with \\(\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!}\\).\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n- First, find \\(5!\\): \\(5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\\).\n- Then, find \\(3!\\): \\(3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\\).\n- Also, find \\((5-3)!\\) which is \\(2!\\): \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\).\n\nNow plug them into the formula: \n\\[\n\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3! \\times 2!} = \\frac{120}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10\n\\]\n\nOh! That reminds me of similar problems I've encountered where once you get the hang of the combination formula, these problems become so much quicker.\n\nQuick check:\n- The number seems reasonable. 10 combinations out of choosing 3 from 5 options feels right based on similar past problems.\n\nReflection on approach:\n- Using the combinations formula was efficient and straightforward for this problem size. Attempting to list all options would be more prone to mistakes and time-consuming.\n- This approach is correct, and the result makes sense with the calculations all checked. \n\nIn conclusion, there are 10 different ways for Mary to choose 3 tourist locations to visit out of 5.\n\nI'm satisfied with this solution!",
