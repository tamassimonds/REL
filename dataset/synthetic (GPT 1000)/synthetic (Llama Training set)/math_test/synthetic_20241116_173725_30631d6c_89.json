    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Initially, this seems like a classic probability problem involving drawing cards from a deck. To start off, let's think about what the problem is asking us to do.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- We're asked to find the probability of drawing two cards from a deck and having them both be either hearts or diamonds.\n- So, we want to count scenarios where both cards are hearts and where both cards are diamonds.\n- A 52-card deck has 13 hearts and 13 diamonds, which seems like a good start, but how do we calculate the probability accurately?\n\n**Brainstorming and Reflections:**\n- This reminds me of probability problems involving \"combinations\" or \"binomial choices\" because order doesn't matter when drawing these cards.\n- I feel like using combinations (\\(C(n, k)\\)) might be a decent strategy here. Hmm... But wait, I should consider whether there are overlaps or multiple scenarios.\n\n**Breaking it down further:**\n1. **Step 1: Calculate the Total Ways to Choose 2 Cards from the Deck**\n   - There are 52 cards in total.\n   - So, the number of ways to choose any 2 cards from the deck is \\(\\binom{52}{2}\\).\n   - Quick calculation: \\(\\binom{52}{2} = \\frac{52 \\times 51}{2} = 1326\\).\n\n2. **Step 2: Calculate the Ways to Choose 2 Hearts from the Hearts Suit**\n   - With 13 hearts, the number of ways to choose 2 hearts is \\(\\binom{13}{2}\\).\n   - Calculation: \\(\\binom{13}{2} = \\frac{13 \\times 12}{2} = 78\\).\n\n3. **Checkpoint: Are These Calculations Correct So Far?**\n   - Yes, calculating the combinations seems correct\u201413 choices from which I select 2.\n\n4. **Step 3: Calculate the Ways to Choose 2 Diamonds from the Diamonds Suit**\n   - Similarly, for diamonds: \\(\\binom{13}{2} = 78\\).\n\n5. **Step 4: Calculate the Total Ways to Choose 2 Hearts or 2 Diamonds**\n   - Since it\u2019s \"either both are hearts or both are diamonds\", these are independent events.\n   - Total ways to have either two hearts or two diamonds: \\(78 + 78 = 156\\).\n\n6. **Step 5: Calculate the Probability**\n   - Probability is defined as the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of potential outcomes.\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{\\text{Ways to choose 2 hearts or 2 diamonds}}{\\text{Total ways to choose any 2 cards}}\\).\n   - Substituting our numbers: Probability = \\(\\frac{156}{1326}\\).\n\n7. **Step 6: Simplify the Fraction**\n   - Let's simplify \\(\\frac{156}{1326}\\).\n   - Their greatest common divisor is 6 just by doing some rough gcd calculation by hand: \n     \\[\n     \\begin{align*}\n     156 \\div 6 &= 26, \\\\\n     1326 \\div 6 &= 221.\n     \\end{align*}\n     \\]\n   - So it simplifies to \\(\\frac{26}{221}\\).\n\n8. **Final Reflection:**\n   - The steps seem well-placed, and \\(\\frac{26}{221}\\) appears to be simplified correctly.\n   - Running through my thought process, I'm pretty confident about this solution given the problem context.\n\nHopefully, I've covered everything with clarity, while reflecting naturally on the process!\n\nAhh, I see now that I've made an error in my previous calculations. Upon reflecting on my solution, I realize the probability I arrived at doesn't match what it should be. Let's take a step-by-step approach again to identify where things went wrong.\n\n**Revisiting Step 5: Calculate the Probability**\n\nPreviously, I calculated the probability as \\(\\frac{156}{1326}\\) and simplified it to \\(\\frac{26}{221}\\), which seemed incorrect upon further inspection. Let's re-evaluate:\n\n1. **Step 5: Calculate the Probability Again**\n\n   - Re-calculating the total number of favorable outcomes:\n     - Ways to choose 2 hearts: \\(\\binom{13}{2} = \\frac{13 \\times 12}{2} = 78\\).\n     - Ways to choose 2 diamonds: \\(\\binom{13}{2} = 78\\).\n     - Total ways to choose either two hearts or two diamonds: \\(78 + 78 = 156\\).\n\n   - The total number of ways to choose any 2 cards from the deck is \\(\\binom{52}{2} = \\frac{52 \\times 51}{2} = 1326\\).\n\n2. **Re-evaluating the Probability:**\n\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{\\text{Ways to choose 2 hearts or 2 diamonds}}{\\text{Total ways to choose any 2 cards}}\\).\n   - Using our recalculations: Probability = \\(\\frac{156}{1326} = \\frac{13 \\times 12}{52 \\times 51}\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\n   - Simplifying \\(\\frac{13 \\times 12}{52 \\times 51}\\), let's cancel common factors:\n     - The greatest common divisor of 156 and 1326 is actually 78, not 6 as I previously thought.\n     - Simplifying: \\(\\frac{156}{1326} = \\frac{2}{17}\\).\n\n4. **Final Reflection:**\n\n   - The correct simplified probability is \\(\\frac{2}{17}\\).\n   - I realize I made a mistake in finding the greatest common divisor earlier, leading to an incorrect fraction.\n\nThrough this recalibration of my process, I can confidently say that the probability of drawing two cards that are either both hearts or both diamonds from a deck is indeed \\(\\frac{2}{17}\\). Thanks to re-evaluating my steps, I arrived at the correct answer, as shown in the revised solution!\n\nAlright, let's delve back into this problem and correct where I went wrong in my initial solution. Upon revisiting my original calculations, I realized that my simplification process for the probability was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate and ensure we get it right this time.\n\n**Revisiting the Probability Calculation:**\n\nTo find the probability of drawing two cards that are either both hearts or both diamonds, we need to reassess our approach and calculations.\n\n**Step 1: Total Ways to Choose 2 Cards from the Deck**\n\nWe correctly calculated earlier that the number of ways to choose any 2 cards from the deck is \\(\\binom{52}{2} = \\frac{52 \\times 51}{2} = 1326\\). This is definitely correct, so we can proceed with this as our base.\n\n**Step 2: Ways to Choose 2 Hearts or 2 Diamonds**\n\nFrom before, we found:\n- The number of ways to choose 2 hearts: \\(\\binom{13}{2} = \\frac{13 \\times 12}{2} = 78\\).\n- The number of ways to choose 2 diamonds: \\(\\binom{13}{2} = 78\\).\n\nThus, the total number of favorable outcomes (two hearts or two diamonds) is \\(78 + 78 = 156\\).\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Probability**\n\nNow, the probability should be the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{156}{1326} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Fraction**\n\nHere is the critical point where my previous mistake occurred. Let's simplify \\(\\frac{156}{1326}\\) again. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 156 and 1326 was miscalculated previously.\n\nBy performing the division correctly:\n\n- Calculate the GCD of 156 and 1326 using the Euclidean algorithm or a simple check:\n  - GCD(156, 1326) is 78.\n\nNow simplifying:\n\n\\[ \\frac{156}{1326} = \\frac{156 \\div 78}{1326 \\div 78} = \\frac{2}{17} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBy recalculating the GCD and simplifying correctly, we arrive at the correct probability of \\(\\frac{2}{17}\\). It turns out that my initial simplification was indeed wrong, leading to an incorrect answer. Through this re-evaluation, I've confidently arrived at the correct solution: the probability of drawing two cards that are both hearts or both diamonds is \\(\\frac{2}{17}\\).\n\nThis journey highlights the importance of double-checking calculations, especially when simplifying fractions, to ensure that every step along the way is accurate.",
