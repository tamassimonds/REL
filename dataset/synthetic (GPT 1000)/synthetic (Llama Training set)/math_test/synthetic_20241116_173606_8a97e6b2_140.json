    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're tasked with finding the sum of two numbers given in different bases and then converting the result into base 10. Specifically, we need to add \\(235_7\\) and \\(1324_5\\), and provide the answer in base 10.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nMy initial thoughts: We're dealing with number systems that aren't in base 10, which can often be tricky. But I know I've dealt with conversions before. The strategy will be to convert each number to base 10 first, perform the addition, and ensure that each step is verified for correctness. It feels similar to problems involving converting units before performing operations, a concept that's quite familiar.\n\n### Step 2: Convert \\(235_7\\) to Base 10\nLet's start with \\(235_7\\):\n\\[ \n235_7 = 2 \\times 7^2 + 3 \\times 7^1 + 5 \\times 7^0 \n\\]\n\nCalculations:\n- \\(7^2 = 49\\), so \\(2 \\times 49 = 98\\).\n- \\(7^1 = 7\\), so \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\).\n- \\(7^0 = 1\\), so \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\).\n\nAdding them up:\n\\[ \n98 + 21 + 5 = 124 \n\\]\nOkay, \\(235_7\\) in base 10 is 124. Let me quickly check if this step looks correct. The conversions seem straightforward here, and the process checks out.\n\n### Step 3: Convert \\(1324_5\\) to Base 10\nNow for \\(1324_5\\):\n\\[ \n1324_5 = 1 \\times 5^3 + 3 \\times 5^2 + 2 \\times 5^1 + 4 \\times 5^0 \n\\]\n\nCalculations:\n- \\(5^3 = 125\\), so \\(1 \\times 125 = 125\\).\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\), so \\(3 \\times 25 = 75\\).\n- \\(5^1 = 5\\), so \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\).\n- \\(5^0 = 1\\), so \\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\).\n\nAdding them up:\n\\[ \n125 + 75 + 10 + 4 = 214 \n\\]\nAlright, \\(1324_5\\) in base 10 is 214. Let me reflect on this: I multiplied each base specifically according to its power, and the steps seem consistent with the method.\n\n### Step 4: Add the Base 10 Numbers\nNow that we have both numbers in base 10, let's add them:\n\\[ \n124 + 214 = 338 \n\\]\n\nQuick check: Is this addition correct? \n- \\(124 + 50 = 174\\),\n- \\(174 + 150 = 324\\),\n- \\(324 + 10 = 334\\),\n- \\(334 + 4 = 338\\).\n\nYep, that holds up.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe base 10 sum of \\(235_7\\) and \\(1324_5\\) is 338. This problem required careful conversion from non-standard bases to base 10 and then straightforward addition. I reflected, recalculated and saw that the steps were consistent with the conversion process I planned initially. \n\nThis helps reinforce the understanding that converting to a common base simplifies multi-base arithmetic, and careful checking ensures accuracy throughout the process.",
