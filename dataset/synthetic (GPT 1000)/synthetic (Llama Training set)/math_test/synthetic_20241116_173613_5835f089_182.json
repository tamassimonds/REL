    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. My initial thought is that this problem involves a circle, which reminds me of the standard form for a circle's equation: \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center of the circle and \\(r\\) is the radius. But the given equation doesn't look like that, so it probably needs to be manipulated into that form.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the given equation\nThe given equation is \\(x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0\\). At first glance, it doesn't quite fit the standard circle form. My thought is that I need to complete the square for both the \\(x\\) terms and the \\(y\\) terms. Once that's done, I'll be closer to getting the equation into the standard circle form.\n\n### Step 2: Completing the square for the \\(x\\) terms\nLet's look at \\(x^2 - 10x\\):\n- To complete the square, I take the coefficient of \\(x\\), which is \\(-10\\), divide it by 2 to get \\(-5\\), and then square it to get \\(25\\).\n- Thus, \\(x^2 - 10x\\) becomes \\((x - 5)^2 - 25\\). \n\n### Step 3: Completing the square for the \\(y\\) terms\nNow for \\(y^2 + 6y\\):\n- Take the coefficient of \\(y\\), which is \\(6\\), divide it by 2 to get \\(3\\), and then square it to get \\(9\\).\n- Thus, \\(y^2 + 6y\\) becomes \\((y + 3)^2 - 9\\).\n\n### Step 4: Rewriting the original equation\nNow, substituting these completed squares into the original equation, I have:\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplifying the equation\nCombine the constant terms:\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 25 + 9 - c\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\n\\]\n\nThe equation now resembles the standard form of a circle's equation \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\(r^2 = 34 - c\\).\n\n### Step 6: Setting the radius\nThe problem states that the radius (\\(r\\)) should be 1. Therefore, \n\\[\nr^2 = 1^2 = 1\n\\]\n\nFrom our completed equation, \\(r^2 = 34 - c\\). So, we set:\n\\[\n34 - c = 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Solving for \\(c\\)\nSolving the equation above, we have:\n\\[\nc = 34 - 1 = 33\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Checking the solution\nIt's always good to double-check everything makes sense. If \\(c = 33\\), then:\n- The modified circle equation is \\((x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 1\\).\n- This matches the condition that the radius is 1 (since \\(1^2 = 1\\)).\n\nEverything checks out! The correct value of \\(c\\) is indeed \\(\\boxed{33}\\). \n\nThis method seemed robust from the start, and breaking the problem into the steps of completing the square worked well. Great!",

  "ground_truth": "Completing the square gives us $(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c$. Since we want the radius to be 1, we must have $34 - c = 1^2$. It follows that $c = \\boxed{33}$."
