    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and explore how we can find the smallest multiple of 6 that's greater than 115. Here's how I would approach it:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n**First Thought:** The problem is asking for the smallest multiple of 6 that is strictly greater than 115. Multiples of 6 are numbers like 6, 12, 18, and so on. So, we are looking for the first number in this series that is larger than 115.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Brainstorming\n**Immediate Ideas:** \n- One straightforward way would be to find multiples of 6 around 115 and check which one is closest but larger.\n- Another approach could be mathematical: dividing 115 by 6 to find how many 6s fit in there and then checking the remainder. This might lead us to quickly find the next multiple.\n- Maybe there's quicker mental math involved? But right now, the cleanest seems using division to pinpoint where 115 lands amidst these multiples.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation via Division\n**Approach:** Let's use division to see where 115 stands in relation to multiples of 6.\n\n1. Divide 115 by 6:  \n   \\[\n   115 \\div 6 = 19.1666...\n   \\]\n   This means 6 goes into 115 a total of 19 times completely, with some remainder. \n\n2. Multiply back to check multiples:\n   - \\( 6 \\times 19 = 114 \\)\n   - Since 114 is less than 115, the next multiple of 6 should be considered.\n\n3. Increment to the next multiple:\n   - Increment 19 to 20, and find \\( 6 \\times 20 \\).\n\n4. Calculate:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Double-Check and Reflect\n**Quick Checks:**\n- Is 120 a multiple of 6? Yes, because any number times 6 is a multiple of it.\n- Is it greater than 115? Yes, since 120 is obviously larger.\n- Was there any possible error? I don't see any, as following both the division result and understanding of multiples reach the same conclusion: 120.\n\n### Conclusion\n**Aha Moment:** The smallest multiple greater than 115 is 120 based on careful computation and logical steps.\n\nI can feel confident about this conclusion because we carefully checked each step and verified both via division and by considering the logical order of multiples relative to 115. If there\u2019s a different insight or easier method, this method aligned with the question requirements: efficiency and clarity.\n\n---\n\nThis reflective and methodical approach ensures correctness and demonstrates how thinking evolves naturally when encountering such mathematical problems.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $M$ be the smallest multiple of 6 greater than 115. $M$ is both a multiple of 2, which means its units digit must be even, and a multiple of 3, which means the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3.  By the first condition, consider multiples of 2 in increasing order: 116, 118, 120, 122, etc. 116 and 118 are not multiples of 3 (since 1+1+6=8 and 1+1+8=10), but 120 is a multiple of 3. Therefore, $M=\\boxed{120}$."
