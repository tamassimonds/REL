    "working_out": "Sure, let's take a look at the given problem and think through it step by step.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- We have a cubic equation, \\(x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - \\frac{19}{10} = 0\\), with roots \\(r\\), \\(s\\), and \\(t\\).\n- We need to find the length of the long diagonal of a box with sides \\(r\\), \\(s\\), and \\(t\\).\n\nThe problem immediately reminds me of the geometry of a box. The long diagonal, in a 3D box with sides \\(r\\), \\(s\\), and \\(t\\), can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{r^2 + s^2 + t^2}\n\\]\n\nBut how do I approach finding \\(r\\), \\(s\\), and \\(t\\) given they are the roots of a polynomial?\n\n**Brainstorming a Strategy:**\n\n1. **Vieta\u2019s formulas** provide useful identities for relating the roots of a polynomial to its coefficients. In this context, knowing Vieta\u2019s can help:\n\n   - \\(r + s + t = 4\\)\n   - \\(rs + rt + st = 5\\)\n   - \\(rst = \\frac{19}{10}\\)\n\n2. To find the diagonal length using Vieta's formulas and identities related to \\(r^2 + s^2 + t^2\\):\n\n   \\[\n   r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = (r+s+t)^2 - 2(rs+rt+st)\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate using the above expression. This simplifies as follows:\n\n   \\[\n   r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = 4^2 - 2 \\times 5 = 16 - 10 = 6\n   \\]\n\n   From this, the length of the diagonal \\(d\\) can now be calculated:\n\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{r^2 + s^2 + t^2} = \\sqrt{6}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflecting on the Solution:**\n\nLet's do a quick check: \n\n- The calculations for \\(r^2 + s^2 + t^2\\) seem correct as we\u2019ve used the proper identity derived from Vieta\u2019s formulas.\n- Computing the square root yields a result that's reasonable given the input.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe length of the long diagonal of the box is \\(\\sqrt{6}\\).\n\nAll steps have been verified, and everything points towards the solution being consistent with the equations presented. If there's an alternative problem-solving method or angle to consider, it would mostly involve solving the cubic equation directly, but given the precision of Vieta\u2019s derived relationships, this seems unnecessary.",

  "ground_truth": "The length of the long diagonal is $\\sqrt{r^2 + s^2 + t^2}.$\n\nBy Vieta's formulas, $r + s + t = 4$ and $rs + rt + st = 5.$  Squaring the equation $r + s + t = 4,$ we get\n\\[r^2 + s^2 + t^2 + 2(rs + rt + st) = 16.\\]Then $r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = 16 - 2(rs + rt + st) = 6,$ so $\\sqrt{r^2 + s^2 + t^2} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{6}}.$"
