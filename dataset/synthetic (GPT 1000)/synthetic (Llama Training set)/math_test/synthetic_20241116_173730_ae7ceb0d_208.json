    "working_out": "### Initial Thoughts\n\nLooking at this problem, the first thing that comes to mind is that it involves distances between points in a coordinate plane. The given equations remind me of the equations for the distance between two points. This suggests to me that these represent the side lengths of some kind of triangle. The determinants are often related to the area of triangles in coordinate geometry when you involve coordinates (particularly the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices).\n\nThe determinant given is of interest. From experience, the determinant of a matrix like \\(\\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\\\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\\) is closely tied to the area of the triangle formed by points \\((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)\\). I'm hoping to use this to connect the distances provided and the desired determinant somehow.\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Interpret the Distances**: First, try interpreting the given conditions as distances in a triangle.\n2. **Relate to Triangle Properties**: Utilize properties of triangles, such as perimeter or area, to relate the distances to the determinant.\n3. **Use Geometry**: Consider using known geometric formulas for the area of a triangle given side lengths (like Heron\u2019s formula).\n4. **Calculate the Determinant**: See if simplifying the determinant expression with the known distances can make things easier.\n\nLet me dive into each part.\n\n### Step 1: Interpreting the Distances\n\nThe equations can be rewritten as:\n- \\((x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 = 9\\) implies the distance between \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is 3.\n- \\((x_1-x_3)^2 + (y_1-y_3)^2 = 16\\) implies the distance between \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_3, y_3)\\) is 4.\n- \\((x_2-x_3)^2 + (y_2-y_3)^2 = 25\\) implies the distance between \\((x_2, y_2)\\) and \\((x_3, y_3)\\) is 5.\n\n### Step 2: Relate to Triangle Properties\n\nThese distances (3, 4, 5) remind me of a right triangle. When you have integer solutions like these, it's often a Pythagorean triple, and hence suggests a right-angled triangle. I suspect this might be useful in calculating the area.\n\n### Step 3: Use Geometry\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of a triangle can be expressed through its side lengths \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 4\\), and \\(c = 5\\). For a right triangle, the area can be simply calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\).\n\nIf this is a right triangle with side lengths as specified, the area would be:\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 4 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6. \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Determinant\n\nFor the given determinant of coordinates representing a triangle:\n- The area of the triangle is given by the absolute value of half the determinant:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left|\\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\\\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\\right|. \\]\n- Since we found the area \\(A = 6\\), we have:\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left|\\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\\\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\\right|. \\]\n\nSolving for the determinant:\n\\[ 12 = \\left|\\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\\\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\\right|. \\]\n\nHence, the square of the determinant (as requested) is:\n\\[ \\left(12\\right)^2 = 144. \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe sought value is \\(\\boxed{144}\\).\n\n### Reflection\n\nEverything seems to check out. The problem fits neatly into a known geometric framework, using the relation between determinants and area. Breaking it down into understanding side lengths as distances, linking to a right triangle's properties, and then using the area to deduce the determinant was satisfying and feels correct. The answer \\(144\\) makes sense given these steps.",
