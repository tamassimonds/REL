    "working_out": "Alright, let's break this problem down step by step and think it through as if we're tackling it together for the first time. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe have the expression \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{5}-\\sqrt{2}}\\) and we need to rationalize the denominator. Rationalizing means getting rid of the square roots in the denominator. This problem seems familiar because it involves a technique often used with expressions involving square roots: multiplying by the conjugate.\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorming Possible Strategies\n- **Using the Conjugate:** My first thought is to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(\\sqrt{5} - \\sqrt{2}\\) is \\(\\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{2}\\). This technique works because the product of conjugates is a difference of squares, which removes the square roots.\n- **Direct Simplification:** Maybe there's a simplification trick using identities, but rationalizing typically leans heavily on the conjugate method.\n\nGiven the context, let's try the conjugate approach first because it seems the most straightforward and likely to work.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Conjugate Method\nLet's multiply the expression by \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{5}-\\sqrt{2}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2})^2}{(\\sqrt{5})^2 - (\\sqrt{2})^2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Denominator\nThe denominator becomes:\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{5})^2 - (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 5 - 2 = 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Numerator\nNow, expand the numerator:\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{2})^2 = (\\sqrt{5})^2 + 2(\\sqrt{5})(\\sqrt{2}) + (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 5 + 2\\sqrt{10} + 2\n\\]\n\\[\n= 7 + 2\\sqrt{10}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Formulating the Rationalized Expression\nSo, the rationalized form of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\frac{7 + 2\\sqrt{10}}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Ensuring the Format Requirements\nWe see this matches the format \\(\\frac{A + B\\sqrt{C}}{D}\\) where \\(A = 7\\), \\(B = 2\\), \\(C = 10\\), and \\(D = 3\\).\n\n### Step 8: Calculating the Final Result\nWe need to ensure that \\(\\gcd(A, B, D) = 1\\). Since 7, 2, and 3 have no common divisors other than 1, this requirement is satisfied.\n\nNow, compute \\(A + B + C + D\\):\n\\[\nA + B + C + D = 7 + 2 + 10 + 3 = 22\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion: Reflecting on the Solution\nEverything checks out with our rationalized form and the conditions given in the problem. The calculated result makes sense with the steps we followed. Our final answer for \\(A + B + C + D\\) is \\(22\\).\n\nAnd there we have it! This problem was a neat application of the conjugate rationalization technique.",
