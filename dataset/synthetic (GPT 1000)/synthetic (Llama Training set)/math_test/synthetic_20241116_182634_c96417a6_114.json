    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem. The question is asking us to find the remainder of \\(7^{17}\\) when divided by 5. At first glance, this seems like a problem of modular arithmetic. Now, let's brainstorm different ways to tackle it.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n1. **Direct Calculation**: Compute \\(7^{17}\\) and then find the remainder when divided by 5. This seems impractical due to the sheer size of \\(7^{17}\\).\n2. **Patterns in Powers**: Look for a repeating cycle in the powers of 7 when divided by 5. Modular arithmetic often exhibits patterns which can be leveraged.\n3. **Fermat's Little Theorem**: This comes to mind because Fermat's Little Theorem deals with powers of numbers modulo a prime. Since 5 is prime, this might be useful.\n4. **Exponential Rules**: Simplifying using properties of exponents and modular arithmetic.\n\n### Exploring Patterns\nLet's explore the pattern method first:\n\n- **Step 1**: Start with small exponents of 7:\n  - \\(7^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\\) because \\(7 \\div 5\\) leaves a remainder of 2.\n  - \\(7^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}\\) because \\(49 \\div 5\\) leaves a remainder of 4.\n  - \\(7^3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}\\) because \\(343 \\div 5\\) leaves a remainder of 3.\n  - \\(7^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\\) because \\(2401 \\div 5\\) leaves a remainder of 1.\n\n- **Step 2**: Notice a cycle here: \\(2, 4, 3, 1\\). These remainders repeat every 4 steps. \n- **Cycle Length**: The sequence repeats every 4 numbers.\n\n### Applying the Pattern\n- **Convert Large Power**: Since \\(7^{17}\\) is what we need, recognize 17 in terms of cycle length:\n  \\[ 17 \\div 4 = 4 \\text{ remainder } 1 \\]\n\n- **Pattern Analysis**: Since 17 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by the cycle length 4, \\(7^{17}\\) corresponds to \\(7^1\\) in the cycle.\n\n### Verification and Check\n- **Verify with Pattern**: From the pattern: \\(7^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\\)\n- **Check for Consistency**: If the pattern holds, \\(7^{17}\\) should yield the same remainder as \\(7^1\\).\n\n### Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem Check\nJust to cross-check with Fermat's theorem:\n- Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem states if \\(p\\) is prime, then \\(a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\). \n- For our case, \\(p = 5\\), so \\(7^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\\).\n- This confirms our cycle of 4 derived from the pattern analysis.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe remainder when \\(7^{17}\\) is divided by 5 is indeed \\( \\boxed{2} \\).\n\nI've explored multiple strategies, verified with Fermat's theorem, and ensured that the cyclical pattern holds, which provides confidence in the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "$7^4 \\equiv 2^4 = 16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, so $7^{17} = 7^{4 \\cdot 4 + 1} = (7^4)^4 \\cdot 7^1 \\equiv 1^4 \\cdot 2 \\equiv \\boxed{2} \\pmod{5}$."
