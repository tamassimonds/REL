I'm interested in finding prime numbers whose squares fall within that range. So the challenge is two-fold: finding the prime numbers and ensuring their squares fit the criteria. \n\n### Step 2: Understanding the Bounds\nTo begin, we need to find the approximate range of numbers whose squares could lie between 100 and 300. \n- If \\( n^2 = 100 \\), then \\( n = \\sqrt{100} = 10 \\).\n- If \\( n^2 = 300 \\), then \\( n = \\sqrt{300} \\approx 17.32 \\).\n\nSo, we will need to check prime numbers from 10 to about 17 to see if their squares fit the range. However, since only integers are being squared, we should really consider \\( n \\) from 11 to 17. Hmm, I should check if I'm missing anything. Also, \\( n^2 = 100 \\) being equal to 10 doesn't count because 10 is not a prime. Moreover, since 17.32 rounds down to 17, it is feasible to include 17. \n\n### Step 3: Identifying Prime Numbers\nNow we list the prime numbers between 11 and 17:\n- **11**\n- **13**\n- **17**\n\nQuick mental check: \n- 11 is prime because it's only divisible by 1 and itself.\n- 13 follows the same logic.\n- 17 also passes the test of being a prime number. \n\nI think this part is right \u2014 primes are spread out in smaller numbers, and it doesn't feel like there's anything else between these values that I've missed.\n\n### Step 4: Checking Squares\nLet's check each of these primes to see if their squares are definitively in the range 100 to 300.\n\n- \\( 11^2 = 121 \\)\n- \\( 13^2 = 169 \\)\n- \\( 17^2 = 289 \\)\n\nEach square is within the 100 to 300 range. This confirms that these primes fit our criteria. \n\nDoing a quick verification again, to ensure my logic is still intact: \n- All calculated squares are accurate and within bounds. \n- It's consistent that only integers between 11 and 17 were considered. \n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nConsidering all checked conditions, the prime numbers that have squares between 100 and 300 are **11, 13,** and **17**.\n\nTherefore, there are **three** prime numbers whose squares are between 100 and 300. \n\nEverything seems to check out correctly, and this kind of approach appears to be sound. No need for arbitrarily large bounds or extra calculations. Feels good!",

  "ground_truth": "Since $10^2 =100$, $17^2 = 289$, and $18^2=324$, we know that the integers whose squares are between 100 and 300 are the integers between 10 and 18.  Between 10 and 18, 3 primes exist: 11, 13, 17, thus the answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
