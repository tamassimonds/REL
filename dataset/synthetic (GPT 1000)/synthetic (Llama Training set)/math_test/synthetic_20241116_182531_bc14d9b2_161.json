    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem. It's about identifying the type of conic section defined by the equation \\((x-3)^2 + y^2 = 10\\). This feels like a familiar type of algebra problem, involving conic sections. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nWhen I see an equation like \\((x-3)^2 + y^2 = 10\\), my mind immediately goes to the standard forms of conic sections: circles, ellipses, hyperbolas, etc. This equation appears similar to the standard form of a circle, which is \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\). \n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Identify the form of the equation:**\n   - The given equation is \\((x-3)^2 + y^2 = 10\\). \n   - Compare to \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\).\n\n2. **Check if it's a circle:**\n   - This form suggests a circle because we have two square terms and a positive sum.\n\n3. **Reflect and verify:**\n   - The equation \\((x-3)^2 + y^2 = 10\\) has the general circle form with no mixed xy-term or linear term, which further indicates this is a circle.\n\n### Calculations\n\n- **Identify the center and radius:**\n  - The center \\((h, k)\\) from \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\) is \\((3, 0)\\).\n  - The right side of the equation represents \\(r^2\\), so \\(r^2 = 10\\).\n  - Thus, the radius \\(r = \\sqrt{10}\\).\n\n### Check and Reflect\n\nWait a second, let's confirm that a circle is indeed the only interpretation here:\n\n- **Considering other conics:**\n  - Ellipses typically have different coefficients for \\((x-h)^2\\) and \\((y-k)^2\\).\n  - Hyperbolas have a subtraction between terms.\n  - Parabolas include only one squared term.\n  - The graph isn't empty because we have a valid radius.\n  - This isn't just a line, a single point, or two intersecting lines, because those forms don't include sums of squared terms equal to a positive number.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYes, after considering all the possibilities, the graph of the equation \\((x-3)^2 + y^2 = 10\\) is indeed a circle centered at \\((3, 0)\\) with radius \\(\\sqrt{10}\\).\n\nIt's satisfying to see the pieces fall into place after reflecting and checking each step. This process confirms the equation describes a circle. I'm confident in saying this because the equation aligns perfectly with the form of a circle with no other terms to suggest otherwise.",
