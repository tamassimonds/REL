    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think it through step by step. We need to find \\(\\sin{X}\\) in the right triangle \\(XYZ\\). \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nFirst, let\u2019s understand what the problem is asking for. We notice that we're dealing with a right triangle and the problem wants us to find \\(\\sin{X}\\). In trigonometry, the sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.\n\n### Step-by-step Exploration\n\n1. **Identifying the components of the triangle:**\n   - We see that point \\(X\\) is at \\((10, 0)\\).\n   - The side labeled \\(10\\) is across points \\(Z(0, 0)\\) and \\(X(10, 0)\\), which means this is actually the horizontal leg of the triangle.\n   - Point \\(Y(3.6, 4.8)\\) must be the vertex of the right angle since it\u2019s the topmost point and connects to both \\(Z\\) and \\(X\\).\n\n2. **Locate the right angle:**\n   - By labeling the corners, we see that \\(Y\\) is the right angle (\\(\\angle ZYX = 90^\\circ\\)).\n   - Given that this is a right triangle, \\(XY\\) must be a leg (not the hypotenuse because it connects to the right angle).\n\n3. **Determine which side is opposite and hypotenuse for \\(\\angle X\\):**\n   - The side opposite to \\(\\angle X\\) is the vertical leg from \\(Y\\) to the base (which is \\(YZ\\)), not specified yet.\n   - The hypotenuse is \\(XY\\).\n\n4. **Realization and re-evaluation:**\n   - Wait a second, I just realized: \\(ZY\\) is unlabeled! But, triangle notation sometimes omits labeling when triangles are simple.\n\n5. **Calculate the missing side using Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   - Let\u2019s avoid needing \\(ZY\\) directly by recalling that \\(\\sin{X} = \\frac{\\text{Opposite}}{\\text{Hypotenuse}}\\).\n   - The hypotenuse \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\), is \\(8\\). \n\n6. **Using Pythagoras to find \\(ZY\\) to cross-check findings:**\n   - Right, let\u2019s just confirm by calculating \\(ZY\\) since \\(XY^2 = XZ^2 + ZY^2\\).\n   - Given \\(XZ = 10\\), \\(XY = 8\\).\n   \\[\n   8^2 = 10^2 + ZY^2 \\Rightarrow ZY^2 = 64 - 100 \\Rightarrow ZY = \\sqrt{36} = 6.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate \\(\\sin{X}\\):**\n   - \\(XZ\\) is the base side.\n   - \\(\\sin{X} = \\frac{ZY}{XY} = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6\\).\n\n### Final Thoughts and Verification\nBy reviewing the setup, our approach consistently points to \\(\\angle X\\) with sides identified as required. Pythagorean theorem confirms the identities of sides.\n\n\\(\\sin{X} = 0.6\\) feels right given the calculations and the triangle\u2019s layout. I verified each side correlation multiple ways and utilized the correct values in calculating the sine.\n\nThus, the solution leads to: \n\n\\(\\boxed{0.6}\\)\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's take the opportunity to reassess the problem and come to the correct conclusion.\n\n### Re-evaluation and Brainstorming\n\nReflecting on my previous work, I realized I incorrectly identified the hypotenuse and made a mistake using the Pythagorean Theorem. Let's methodically review and correct that.\n\n1. **Clarification of Known Values:**\n   - We have a right triangle \\(XYZ\\) with sides \\(XZ = 10\\), \\(XY = 8\\), and we need to find the opposite side to \\(\\angle X\\), which is \\(YZ\\).\n\n2. **Revisiting the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   - The Pythagorean Theorem states \\(XZ^2 = XY^2 + YZ^2\\).\n\n3. **Correct Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   YZ = \\sqrt{XZ^2 - XY^2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   YZ = \\sqrt{10^2 - 8^2} = \\sqrt{100 - 64} = \\sqrt{36} = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating \\(\\sin{X}\\) Correctly:**\n   - Now, understanding that \\(\\angle X\\) is adjacent to the side \\(XY = 8\\) but opposite to \\(YZ = 6\\), we have the hypotenuse \\(XZ = 10\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(\\sin{X} = \\frac{\\text{Opposite side (YZ)}}{\\text{Hypotenuse (XZ)}} = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\n### Reflection and Verification\nUpon re-evaluation, everything aligns correctly: the calculation of \\(YZ\\) using the Pythagorean Theorem checks out, and the definition of sine in a right triangle gives us \\(\\sin{X} = \\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\nFinal answer: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}\\).",
