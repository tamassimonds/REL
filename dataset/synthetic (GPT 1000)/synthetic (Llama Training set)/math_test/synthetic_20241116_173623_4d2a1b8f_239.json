    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're asked to determine how many of the integers from 1 to 6 are divisors of the number 1452. \n\n### First Thoughts:\nWhen I first see a problem involving divisors, I think about the process of dividing numbers. This reminds me of basic factors and divisibility rules from math classes. Checking divisibility can be straightforward or require a bit more thought, especially if I'm not sure off the top of my head.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies:\n1. **Straightforward Division:** I could simply take each number from 1 to 6 and divide 1452 by it, checking if there's no remainder. This is the most direct approach but might take some time.\n   \n2. **Divisibility Rules:** This could save time. For example, I remember some rules: a number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even, by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, and so on.\n\n3. **Mathematical Tools:** I don't have any besides basic arithmetic, so manual checking seems necessary.\n\n### Initial Calculations and Checks:\n- **Divisor: 1**\n  - Any number is divisible by 1. So, 1 is definitely a divisor.\n\n- **Divisor: 2**\n  - Divisibility rule: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. \n  - Last digit of 1452 is 2, which is even. \n  - So, 1452 is divisible by 2. Let's check by division to confirm: 1452 \u00f7 2 = 726 with no remainder.\n\n- **Divisor: 3**\n  - Rule: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n  - Sum of digits: 1 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 12.\n  - 12 is divisible by 3.\n  - So, 1452 is divisible by 3. Checking by division: 1452 \u00f7 3 = 484, no remainder.\n\n- **Divisor: 4**\n  - Rule: A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n  - Last two digits are 52. Checking 52 \u00f7 4 = 13 with no remainder.\n  - So, 1452 is divisible by 4.\n\n- **Divisor: 5**\n  - Rule: A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5.\n  - 1452 ends with 2, so it's not divisible by 5. This saves me from further calculations.\n\n- **Divisor: 6**\n  - Rule: A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n  - We've already determined 1452 is divisible by 2 and 3.\n  - Hence, 1452 is divisible by 6 as well. Checking by division: 1452 \u00f7 6 = 242 with no remainder.\n\n### Reflection and Double-check:\n- I've marked each step with divisibility rules and straightforward division, and they all check out. I've considered each divisor from 1 to 6.\n- The divisors of 1452 from this range are: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n- Not 5 because of the last digit rule.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFive of the numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) from the range 1 to 6 are divisors of 1452. Double-checking with all rules and calculations confirms the results are sound. This approach feels solid and replicable for similar problems. \n\nIf I ever doubted any, I'd return to the rules or calculated divisions to verify again. This step-by-step method is reliable for such divisor problems.",

  "ground_truth": "All numbers are divisible by $1$. The last two digits, $52$, form a multiple of 4, so the number is divisible by $4$, and thus $2$. $1+4+5+2=12$, which is a multiple of $3$, so $1452$ is divisible by $3$.  Since it is divisible by $2$ and $3$, it is divisible by $6$.  But it is not divisible by $5$ as it does not end in $5$ or $0$.  So the total is $\\boxed{5}$."
