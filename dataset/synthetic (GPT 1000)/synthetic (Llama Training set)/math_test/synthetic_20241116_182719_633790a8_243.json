    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n### Understanding the Problem: \nInitially, this problem seems to revolve around quadratic equations and symmetries in their solutions. We have an equation \\(x^2 + ax + b = 0\\) and we need to find pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are roots of this equation. \n\nFirst thoughts: This kind of setup might involve using the properties of the quadratic formula, specifically the sums and products of roots. Something similar to this feels familiar from problems involving symmetric equations, like systems where roots swap roles or specific algebraic identities.\n\n### First Strategy: Symmetric Properties of Roots\nTo begin, let me check the symmetric properties we can deduce from the equation:\n\n1. For a quadratic equation \\(x^2 + px + q = 0\\), the roots \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) satisfy:\n   - \\(r_1 + r_2 = -p\\)\n   - \\(r_1 r_2 = q\\)\n\nIn our case, for \\(x^2 + ax + b = 0\\) having both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as roots, the relationships are:\n- The sum of the roots \\(a + b = -a\\)\n- The product of the roots \\(ab = b\\)\n\n### Checking Initial Thoughts\nWait a second, the sum and product conditions look contradictory outright\u2014let's confirm or disprove these inconsistencies:\n\n1. **For the sum \\(a + b = -a\\):**\n   \\[\n   b = -2a\n   \\]\n\n2. **For the product \\(ab = b\\):**  \n   This implies \\(b(a - 1) = 0\\). Thus:\n   - \\(b = 0\\) or \n   - \\(a = 1\\)  \n\n### Reflecting and Combining Relations\nOkay, here's something interesting:\n\n1. If \\(b = 0\\), substituting in \\(b = -2a\\) gives \\(0 = -2a\\), so \\(a = 0\\).\n\nIn turn, a quick check shows:\n- The equation becomes \\(x^2 = 0\\), which has a double root at \\(x = 0\\).\n- Therefore, \\((a, b) = (0, 0)\\) is a valid pair.\n\n2. If \\(a = 1\\), and substituting this in \\(b = -2\\), ensure:\n   - Check if \\(b = -2\\) works: Plug into the equation \\(x^2 + x - 2 = 0\\), with roots:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm 3}{2}\n     \\]\n     Which results in roots \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -2\\). So yes, \\(b = -2\\) works and thus: \n     - \\((a, b) = (1, -2)\\) is valid.\n\n### Final Reflection and Solution Confirmation\nAfter double-checking calculations and logical steps, it looks like the problem asked for specific legitimate cases where these roles could exchange naturally between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nThe successful identification of two pairs \\((a, b)\\) satisfies all the initial quadratic equation conditions. Thus, the number of ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that they are both roots to the same quadratic equation is \\(\\boxed{2}\\): \\((0, 0)\\) and \\((1, -2)\\). \n\nEach step seems coherent with quadratic identities, and necessary checks confirm these consistent relations. Hence, I've reached the solution thoroughly after reviewing these logical travel paths.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's revisit the problem with a fresh perspective and correct the oversight.\n\n### Reevaluating the Problem:\n\nWe need to find the ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) where both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are roots of the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + ax + b = 0\\). My previous analysis missed a possible solution, so let's see where I might have gone astray and explore the problem with more attention to detail.\n\n### Revisiting the Known Conditions:\n\n1. Since \\(a\\) is a root, substituting \\(x = a\\) gives us:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + aa + b = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2a^2 + b = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = -2a^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Since \\(b\\) is also a root, substituting \\(x = b\\) gives us:\n   \\[\n   b^2 + ab + b = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b(b + a + 1) = 0\n   \\]\n\n### Analyzing Each Case:\n\n#### Case 1: \\(b = 0\\)\n\n- From the equation \\(2a^2 + b = 0\\) we have:\n  \\[\n  2a^2 + 0 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = 0\n  \\]\n\n- This gives the solution \\((a, b) = (0, 0)\\).\n\n#### Case 2: \\(b + a + 1 = 0\\)\n\n- If \\(b + a + 1 = 0\\), then:\n  \\[\n  b = -a - 1\n  \\]\n\n- Substituting \\(b = -2a^2\\) again, we have:\n  \\[\n  -2a^2 = -a - 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2a^2 - a - 1 = 0 \n  \\]\n\n- Solving the quadratic equation \\(2a^2 - a - 1 = 0\\), using the quadratic formula \\(a = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = -1\\), \\(c = -1\\) gives:\n  \\[\n  a = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-1)}}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8}}{4} = \\frac{1 \\pm 3}{4} \n  \\]\n\n- This yields two solutions for \\(a\\):\n  \\[\n  a = \\frac{4}{4} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a = \\frac{-2}{4} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- For \\(a = 1\\), substituting back, \\(b = -2(1)^2 = -2\\), giving us the pair \\((1, -2)\\).\n\n- For \\(a = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), substituting back, \\(b = -2(-\\frac{1}{2})^2 = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), giving us the pair \\((-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2})\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nUpon reevaluating with the corrected calculations, we find three valid pairs \\((a, b)\\):\n1. \\((0, 0)\\)\n2. \\((1, -2)\\)\n3. \\((-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2})\\)\n\nTherefore, the number of ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) that satisfy the problem's conditions is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).
