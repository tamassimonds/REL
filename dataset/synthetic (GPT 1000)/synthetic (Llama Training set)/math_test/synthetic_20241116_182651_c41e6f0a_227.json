    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this. The problem involves a particle moving along a specific path and at a given rate in terms of its \\(x\\)-coordinate. My goal is to express the \\(y\\)-coordinate as a function of time \\(t\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n1. The line equation given is \\(y = \\frac{3}{2}x - 2\\). I recognize this as the standard equation of a straight line in the slope-intercept form, where \\(m = \\frac{3}{2}\\) is the slope.\n\n2. The particle starts at \\((-2, -5)\\), and its \\(x\\)-coordinate increases at a constant rate of 4 units per unit of time. This rate suggests we'll deal with a linear increase for \\(x(t)\\).\n\n3. I need to find \\(y(t)\\), which will depend on both the line equation and how \\(x\\) changes over time.\n\n**Brainstorming the Approach:**\n\n- My first thought is to express \\(x\\) as a function of \\(t\\), knowing \\(x(t = 0) = -2\\) and it increases by 4 units per time unit.\n- Once I have \\(x(t)\\), I can substitute it into the line equation to find \\(y(t)\\).\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n1. **Express \\(x(t)\\):**\n   - At \\(t = 0\\), \\(x = -2\\).\n   - As \\(t\\) increases, \\(x\\) changes by 4 units per unit time:\n     \\[\n     x(t) = -2 + 4t\n     \\]\n   - **Check:** At \\(t = 0\\), \\(x(0) = -2\\), which matches the initial condition. Looks good so far.\n\n2. **Substitute \\(x(t)\\) into the line equation:**\n   - Using the equation of the line \\(y = \\frac{3}{2}x - 2\\), substitute \\(x(t)\\):\n     \\[\n     y(t) = \\frac{3}{2}x(t) - 2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y(t) = \\frac{3}{2}(-2 + 4t) - 2\n     \\]\n  \n3. **Simplify to find \\(y(t)\\):**\n   - Distribute \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) in the equation:\n     \\[\n     y(t) = \\frac{3}{2}(-2) + \\frac{3}{2}(4t) - 2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y(t) = -3 + 6t - 2\n     \\]\n   - Combine constants:\n     \\[\n     y(t) = 6t - 5\n     \\]\n\n**Reflection & Quick Check:**\n\n- Good practice: when \\(t = 0\\), check if I recover the starting \\(y\\)-coordinate:\n  \\[\n  y(0) = 6(0) - 5 = -5\n  \\]\n  That matches the initial point \\((-2, -5)\\).\n\n- Check the slope: Since \\(x\\)-changes at \\(4\\) units per time unit, and the line slope is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), \\(y\\) should change at \\(\\frac{3}{2} \\times 4 = 6\\) units per time unit. This matches \\(6t\\) in \\(y(t)\\).\n\n**Final Expression:**\n\n- Everything checks out with determining \\(y\\)-coordinate as a function of time. Thus, the correct function is:\n  \\[\n  y(t) = 6t - 5\n  \\]\n\nThis approach appears solid, and the solution matches both initial and calculated conditions. I'm confident it's correct.",
