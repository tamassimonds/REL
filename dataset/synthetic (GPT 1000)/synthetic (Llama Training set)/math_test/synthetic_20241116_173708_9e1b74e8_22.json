    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem by breaking it down step-by-step. I'll start with my initial understanding and ideas for approaches, and then dive into the calculations.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts:\n- \"Okay, so Kent won 25% of his games. If he lost 12 games, I need to figure out how many he won.\"\n- \"No ties means every game was either a win or a loss.\"\n- \"This seems like it might involve some easy percentage calculations.\"\n\nInitial observations:\n- \"If Kent won 25% of the total games, that means he lost 75% of them because win + loss = 100%.\"\n\n**Step 2: Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Use proportions**:\n   - \"Let\u2019s say the total number of games he played is \\( x \\).\"\n   - \"Since he won 25% of them, \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the games were wins, and \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) were losses.\"\n   - \"We know he lost 12 games. If losses are \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of all games, then \\( \\frac{3}{4}x = 12 \\).\"\n   \n2. **Check different approaches**:\n   - \"Alternatively, I could find the total number of games first and then multiply by the win percentage.\"\n   - \"But since I already started with proportions and equations, let\u2019s pursue this.\"\n\n**Step 3: Solving the Proportion Equation**\n\n1. Solve for \\( x \\):\n   - \"Hmm, let's solve this: \\( \\frac{3}{4}x = 12 \\).\"\n   - \"Multiply both sides by \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) to isolate \\( x \\):\"\n   \\[\n   x = 12 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculating:\n   - \"Okay, let\u2019s calculate this: \\( 12 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 12 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 48 \\div 3 = 16 \\).\"\n   - \"So, he played 16 games in total.\"\n\n**Step 4: Determining the Number of Wins**\n\n- \"Now, to find how many games he won, calculate 25% of the total games.\"\n- \"25% of 16 games: \\( 0.25 \\times 16 = 4 \\).\"\n\n**Step 5: Verify and Reflect**\n\n1. Check the consistency:\n   - \"Let's check this: If he won 4 games and lost 12 games, that totals 16 games. Yep, matches the total number.\"\n   - \"Reflecting on this, the problem seems to work perfectly with my solution.\"\n\n2. Random insights:\n   - \"Actually, it's interesting how these basic percentage problems rely so much on setting up the right equation.\"\n\n3. Double-check approach:\n   - \"The approach I took using proportions seems right, and the math checks out.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nKent won 4 games on Saturday. This feels right, considering everything balances out correctly with the equation and checks.",

  "ground_truth": "If Kent won $25\\%$ of the games, he lost $75\\%$ of them.  Thus if $g$ is the total number of games he played,\n\n$$12=0.75(g)\\Rightarrow g=16$$\n\nSo the number of games he won was $16-12=\\boxed{4}$."
