    "working_out": "First Thoughts:  \nAlright, so this question is dealing with inverse proportionality. It reminds me of problems I\u2019ve done before where if one value increases when the other decreases, they must be inversely related. So here, as \\( j \\) increases, \\( k \\) should decrease, and vice versa.\n\nI know the equation for inverse proportionality is something like this: \\( j \\times k = \\text{constant} \\) or \\( j = \\frac{\\text{constant}}{k} \\).\n\nHmm... maybe I should try finding the constant first since that feels like a logical step to get to the unknown value later.\n\nStep 1: Finding the constant of proportionality  \nI\u2019m given that \\( j = 42 \\) when \\( k = 56 \\). So I can set up the equation using the inverse proportionality concept:  \n\\[ j \\times k = 42 \\times 56 \\]\n\nWait, let\u2019s calculate this:  \n\\[ 42 \\times 56 \\]\n\nOh, multiplication... alright, let\u2019s do this step-by-step. It should be straightforward, but I can use the distributive property if it gets messy.\n\n\\[ 42 \\times 56 = (40 + 2) \\times 56 = 40 \\times 56 + 2 \\times 56 \\]\n\nLet\u2019s individually calculate those:  \n\\[ 40 \\times 56 = 2240 \\]  \n\\[ 2 \\times 56 = 112 \\]\n\nNow, add them up:  \n\\[ 2240 + 112 = 2352 \\]\n\nGreat! So the constant is 2352.\n\nStep 2: Using the constant to find the unknown value  \nI need to find \\( j \\) when \\( k = 32 \\).\n\nNow, using the equation \\( j \\times k = \\text{constant} \\), I\u2019ll substitute \\( k = 32 \\):  \n\\[ j \\times 32 = 2352 \\]\n\nNow solve for \\( j \\):  \n\\[ j = \\frac{2352}{32} \\]\n\nLet me grab a calculator or work this out:  \n\\[ \\frac{2352}{32} \\]\n\nA quick division:  \n\nOkay, let\u2019s break this down:  \n\n- Divide 2352 by 32 using division.  \n- How many times does 32 fit into 2352?\n\nHmm... start smaller, maybe by dividing bit by bit or estimate:\n\n\\[ 32 \\) goes into \\( 235.2 \\) approximately 7 times (since 32 x 7 = 224, close to 235).  \nActually, let me check:  \n\\[ 32 x 7 = 224 \\]\n\nHmm... okay, subtract from 235.2 to get 11.2 and bring down more values if needed...\n\nAh, I jumped a bit \u2013 smoothly do division without rounding or large steps: redo:\n\n\\[ 32 fits into 2352 exactly 73.5 times. I can check with direct calculation to confirm. If it doesn't seem right, redo quickly.\n\n\\[ 32 \\times 73.5 = 2352\\] exactly!\n\nYay, the math confirms it!  \n\nConclusion:  \nThe value of \\( j \\) when \\( k = 32 \\) is \\( j = 73.5 \\).\n\nDouble check: Is everything making sense logically and mathematically? Yep! It was indirectly done.\n\nSo, the answer is \\( j = 73.5 \\), as a decimal rounded to the nearest tenth.",

Using this $C$ value, we can solve for $j$ when $k=32$: \\begin{align*}\nj\\cdot 32&=2352\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad j&=\\frac{2352}{32}=\\boxed{73.5}\n\\end{align*}"
