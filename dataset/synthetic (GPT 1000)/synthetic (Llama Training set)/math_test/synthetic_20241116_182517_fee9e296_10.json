    "working_out": "Okay, let's explore this problem step by step and see what we can do. \n\nInitial Thoughts:\nThis expression initially seems like a straightforward application of basic arithmetic operations, but I need to be sure of the order of operations. When I first look at it, I recognize elements of the expression that require following the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right)). Let's apply that here.\n\nLet's start dissecting the expression: \\(\\frac{1}{-6} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot (7-1)\\).\n\nBreaking it down:\n- There\u2019s a fraction at the beginning, which can be thought of as a division: \\(\\frac{1}{-6}\\) is equivalent to \\(1 \\div (-6)\\).\n- Then we have \\(6 \\cdot 7\\) which is straightforward multiplication.\n- There's also \\(8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8\\) which involves both multiplication and division.\n- Finally, the expression includes parentheses, \\((7-1)\\), which should be evaluated first.\n\nStep-by-Step Approach and Evaluation:\n1. **Evaluate the Parentheses**: \n   - First, solve the expression inside the parentheses: \\(7 - 1 = 6\\).\n\n2. **Deal with Each Segment According to PEMDAS**:\n   - Begin with the fraction: \\(\\frac{1}{-6} = -\\frac{1}{6}\\) or \\(-0.1667\\).\n   - Next, consider \\((-0.1667) \\cdot 6\\).\n     - Multiplying gives: \\((-0.1667) \\cdot 6 \\approx -1\\).\n     - Now multiply the result by 7: \n       \\(-1 \\cdot 7 = -7\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the Second Part of the Expression**:\n   - \\(8 \\cdot 2 = 16\\).\n   - Divide by 8: \\(16 \\div 8 = 2\\).\n   - Finally, multiply by the result of the parentheses: \\(2 \\cdot 6 = 12\\).\n\n4. **Combine Results**:\n   - From the first part of the expression, we have \\(-7\\).\n   - From the second part, we have \\(12\\).\n   - Now add these results together: \\(-7 + 12 = 5\\).\n\nCheck and Reflect:\n- Each step followed the order of operations correctly.\n- I evaluated the parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right, ensuring that operations were handled per PEMDAS.\n- The final answer is reasonable, considering the steps and calculations carried out.\n\nConclusion:\nThe value of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{-6} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot (7-1)\\) is \\(5\\). Throughout the process, reflecting after crucial operations ensured that calculations remained on the right track.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we recall that the reciprocal of a negative number is the negation of the reciprocal: $\\frac{1}{-x} = -\\frac{1}{x}$. Thus, we can rewrite $\\frac{1}{-6}$ as $-\\frac{1}{6}$. Now our expression is $-\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot (7-1)$.\n\nWe need to to what is in parentheses first, so we subtract 1 from 7 to get 6. Our expression is now $-\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot 6$.\n\nBecause multiplication and division is performed before addition and subtraction, we multiply and divide first, going from left to right. A number times its reciprocal is one, so our expression is $(-1) \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot 6$. Multiplying and dividing from left to right, we find  \\begin{align*}\n(-1) \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot 6 &= (-7) + 8\\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot 6 \\\\\n&= (-7) + 16 \\div 8 \\cdot 6 \\\\\n&= (-7) + 2 \\cdot 6 \\\\\n&= (-7) + 12.\n\\end{align*}Now, completing the addition, our answer is $\\boxed{5}$."
