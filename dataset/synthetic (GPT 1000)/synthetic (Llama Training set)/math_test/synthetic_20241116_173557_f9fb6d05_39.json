    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, keeping track of initial thoughts, realizations, and adjustments as we work through it.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nWe are given the equation \\( |x+5| - |3x-6| = 0 \\). The goal is to find the largest possible value of \\( x \\).\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- Two absolute value expressions suggest we need to consider different cases due to the nature of absolute values.\n- Generally, with equations involving absolute values, we solve for each expression being non-negative or negative (i.e., split the domain based on the zero points of the expressions).\n\n### Brainstorming and Strategy\n\nConsider the key points:\n- \\( |x+5| \\) changes its behavior (sign) at \\( x = -5 \\).\n- \\( |3x-6| \\) changes its behavior at \\( x = 2 \\).\n\nThis suggests dividing the x-axis into intervals based on these critical points: \n1. \\( x < -5 \\)\n2. \\( -5 \\leq x < 2 \\)\n3. \\( x \\geq 2 \\)\n\nFor each interval, we express the equation without absolute values and solve accordingly.\n\n### Solving the Problem\n\n**Case 1: \\( x < -5 \\)**\n\n- Here, \\( x+5 < 0 \\) and \\( 3x-6 < 0 \\).\n- So, \\( |x+5| = -(x+5) \\) and \\( |3x-6| = -(3x-6) \\).\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\\[\n-(x+5) + (3x-6) = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n- x - 5 + 3x - 6 = 0 \\implies 2x - 11 = 0 \\implies 2x = 11 \\implies x = \\frac{11}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check Validity:**\n\\( \\frac{11}{2} = 5.5 \\), which does not satisfy \\( x < -5 \\). So no solutions from this interval.\n\n**Case 2: \\( -5 \\leq x < 2 \\)**\n\n- Here, \\( x+5 \\geq 0 \\) and \\( 3x-6 < 0 \\).\n- Thus, \\( |x+5| = x+5 \\) and \\( |3x-6| = -(3x-6) \\).\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\\[\n(x+5) + (3x-6) = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\nx + 5 + 3x - 6 = 0 \\implies 4x - 1 = 0 \\implies 4x = 1 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Check Validity:**\n\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) satisfies the interval \\( -5 \\leq x < 2 \\). So this is a valid solution.\n\n**Case 3: \\( x \\geq 2 \\)**\n\n- Here, \\( x+5 \\geq 0 \\) and \\( 3x-6 \\geq 0 \\).\n- So, \\( |x+5| = x+5 \\) and \\( |3x-6| = 3x-6 \\).\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\\[\n(x+5) - (3x-6) = 0 \n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\nx + 5 - 3x + 6 = 0 \\implies -2x + 11 = 0 \\implies 2x = 11 \\implies x = \\frac{11}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check Validity:**\n\\( \\frac{11}{2} \\approx 5.5 \\) satisfies \\( x \\geq 2 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe valid solutions are \\( x = \\frac{1}{4} \\) from Case 2 and \\( x = \\frac{11}{2} \\) from Case 3. The largest possible value is the latter.\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{11}{2}}\\)",

  "ground_truth": "We begin by moving the second inequality to the right side of the equation, giving us $|x+5|=|3x-6|$. From here, we can split the equation into two separate cases.  For the first case, note that if $x+5$ and $3x-6$ have the same sign, then $x+5=3x-6$:\n\nCase 1: \\begin{align*} x+5&=3x-6\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad -2x&=-11\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=\\frac{11}{2}\n\\end{align*}If we plug this value of $x$ back into the original equation to check our answer, we get that $\\left|\\frac{11}{2}+5\\right|-\\left|3\\left(\\frac{11}{2}\\right)-6\\right|=0$ or $0=0$. Since this is true, we can accept $x=\\frac{11}{2}$ as a valid solution.\n\nFor case two, note that if $x+5$ has a different sign than $3x-6$, then $x+5=-(3x-6)$.\n\nCase 2: \\begin{align*} x+5&=-(3x-6)\n\\\\ x+5&=-3x+6\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 4x&=1\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=\\frac{1}{4}\n\\end{align*}If we plug this value of $x$ back into the original equation to check our answer, we get that $\\left|\\frac{1}{4}+5\\right|-\\left|3\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)-6\\right|=0$, which also gives us $0=0$. This is always true, so we can accept $x=\\frac{1}{4}$ as a valid solution as well. Thus, our two possible solutions are $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{11}{2}$. Since the question asks for the largest possible value of $x$, our final solution is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{2}}$."
