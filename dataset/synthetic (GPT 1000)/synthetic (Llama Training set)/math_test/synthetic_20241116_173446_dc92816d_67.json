    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's make sure we comprehend what the problem is asking. We have two positive integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) such that:\n\n1. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) is 8.\n2. The least common multiple (LCM) of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) is 112.\n\nThe goal is to determine the least possible value of \\( m + n \\).\n\n### Brainstorming\n\nThink about what I know:\n- The formula that relates GCD and LCM of two numbers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) is \\( \\text{GCD}(m, n) \\times \\text{LCM}(m, n) = m \\times n \\).\n- In our case, \\( 8 \\times 112 = m \\times n \\).\n\nLet's compute that:\n\\[ 8 \\times 112 = 896. \\]\nSo, \\( m \\times n = 896 \\).\n\nConsidering the constraints:\n- \\( \\gcd(m, n) = 8 \\) tells me that both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) must be multiples of 8.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\nGiven that both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are multiples of 8, we can express them as:\n- \\( m = 8a \\) and \\( n = 8b \\) where \\( \\gcd(a, b) = 1 \\).\n\nThis is because the additional factors of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must have no common factors other than 1 due to the structure of GCD and LCM.\n\nSubstituting into the product equation:\n\\[ (8a) \\times (8b) = 896 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[ 64ab = 896 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( ab \\),\n\\[ ab = \\frac{896}{64} = 14 \\]\n\nNow we need integer pairs \\( (a, b) \\) such that their product is 14 and they are coprime.\n\n### Trying Possible Values\n\nLet's consider pairs \\( (a, b) \\) for which \\( a \\times b = 14 \\). We also need them to be coprime:\n\n1. \\( (1, 14) \\)\n2. \\( (14, 1) \\)\n3. \\( (2, 7) \\)\n4. \\( (7, 2) \\)\n\nIt seems both \\( (1, 14) \\) and \\( (2, 7) \\) are valid because they are coprime pairs. Let's calculate \\( m+n \\) for these pairs:\n\n#### First Pair: \\( (a, b) = (1, 14) \\)\n\\[ m = 8 \\times 1 = 8 \\]\n\\[ n = 8 \\times 14 = 112 \\]\n\\[ m+n = 8 + 112 = 120 \\]\n\n#### Second Pair: \\( (a, b) = (2, 7) \\)\n\\[ m = 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\]\n\\[ n = 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\]\n\\[ m+n = 16 + 56 = 72 \\]\n\nReflecting on these results, the least \\( m+n \\) achieved was 72 using the \\( (2, 7) \\) pair.\n\n### Verification\n\nEnsure \\( \\gcd(16, 56) = 8 \\) and \\( \\operatorname{lcm}(16, 56) = 112 \\).\n\n- **GCD Verification**: Check divisibility\n  - Prime factorizations: \\( 16 = 2^4, 56 = 2^3 \\times 7 \\)\n  - Common power of 2: \\( 2^3 = 8 \\).\n\n- **LCM Verification**: Check if that's 112\n  - Combining all factors: \\( 2^4 \\times 7 = 112 \\).\n\nBoth conditions indeed satisfy the problem\u2019s requirements.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe least possible value of \\( m + n = 72 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since the GCD of $m$ and $n$ is 8, $m = 8x$ and $n = 8y$ for some integers $x$ and $y$.  Note that minimizing $m + n = 8x + 8y = 8(x + y)$ is equivalent to minimizing $x + y$.\n\nThe LCM of $m$ and $n$ is $112 = 2^4 \\cdot 7 = 8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7$, so one of $x$ and $y$ is divisible by 2 and one is divisible by 7.  Then we can minimize $x + y$ by setting $x$ and $y$ to be 2 and 7 in some order.  Therefore, the least possible value of $m+n$ is $8(2 + 7) = \\boxed{72}$."
