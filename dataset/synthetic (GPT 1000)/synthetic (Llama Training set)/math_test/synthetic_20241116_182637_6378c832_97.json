    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem!\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, it reminds me of similar problems involving alternating regions of circles or shapes. I immediately think of patterns because of the alternation between red and green, and envision the areas in terms of differences between squares of radii. \n\nLet's start breaking down what we know:\n\n- We have 100 concentric circles with increasing radii from 1 to 100.\n- The interior of the circle of radius 1 is fully red.\n- From then on, regions alternate in color (red, then green, and so forth).\n- It's clear we'll be finding areas of annular regions (essentially donuts) between consecutive circles.\n  \nInitial reaction: it feels like we should calculate the areas of these regions and alternate summation for green and red.\n\n**Exploring a Strategy:**\n\n1. **Determine Areas of Regions**:\n   - The area of a circle with radius \\( r \\) is given by \\( \\pi r^2 \\).\n   - Thus, the annular region between the circle of radius \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\) has an area of \\( \\pi [(n+1)^2 - n^2] = 2\\pi(n+1)\\).\n\n2. **Identify Color Patterns**:\n   - The region \\( (1, 2] \\) is green.\n   - The region \\( (2, 3] \\) is red.\n   - Continue this alternation until the last region \\( (99, 100] \\).\n\n   Looks like for even \\( n \\), \\( (n, n+1] \\) is green, and for odd \\( n \\), it is red.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Green Area**:\n   - I can list areas of green regions: \n     \\[\n     (1, 2], (3, 4], (5, 6], ..., (99, 100]\n     \\]\n   - I notice a pattern here. Green regions correspond to ranges of even \\( n = 1, 3, 5, \\ldots, 99 \\).\n\n4. **Summing the Green Areas**:\n   - Generalizing: The area of the \\( n \\)-th green region is \\( 2\\pi(1 + 2m) \\), where \\( m = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 49 \\) because we have 50 green regions.\n   - Total green area:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{m=0}^{49} 2\\pi(1 + 2m) = 2\\pi(1 + 3 + 5 + \\cdots + 99)\n     \\]\n   - Recognizing the sum of the first 50 odd numbers is straightforward: it is \\( 50^2 \\).\n\n   Let's stop and check this calculation: \n   \\[\n   1 + 3 + 5 + \\cdots + 99 = 2500\n   \\]\n   So indeed, the sum up is saying we've included all 50 green regions accurately.\n\n5. **Calculate Area of Circle with Radius 100**:\n   - The outermost circle area: \\( \\pi \\times 100^2 = 10000\\pi \\).\n\n6. **Green to Total Area Ratio**:\n   - Compute ratio of green area to total area:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Green Area} = 2\\pi \\times 2500 = 5000\\pi \n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{5000\\pi}{10000\\pi} = \\frac{5000}{10000} = \\frac{1}{2}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Express Ratio as \\( m/n \\)**:\n   - Here, \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 2 \\). Sum \\( m+n = 3 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis reinforces that alternating regions correctly accounts for the color pattern, and each step holds when checking the math for areas and sequences. This leads to the neat solution that \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the circle is green in terms of the total possible area. \n\nThus, the final answer to the problem is \\( \\boxed{3} \\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial analysis. Let's revisit and reevaluate the problem to find the correct solution.\n\n**Rechecking the Initial Approach:**\n\nInitially, I calculated the areas of the annular regions and then alternated their sum based on their color. However, I might have miscalculated the step involving the sum of the areas of green regions. Let's systematically analyze this again.\n\n**Reflecting on the Color Pattern:**\n\nI initially observed that each annular region between radii \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\) follows a strict color alternation pattern. What I need is a more accurate method to sum the areas of the green regions specifically.\n\n**Revising the Calculation Approach:**\n\n1. **Reconsider the Green Regions:**\n   - The green regions are those where the radius squared difference sums up to odd indices, i.e., \\( n, n+1 \\) when \\( n \\) is odd.\n\n2. **Correcting the Sum Calculation:**\n   - Let's explicitly rewrite the sum of the green areas:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Green areas} = \\left[(2^2 - 1^2) + (4^2 - 3^2) + (6^2 - 5^2) + \\cdots + (100^2 - 99^2)\\right]\\pi\n     \\]\n\n3. **Using a More Systematic Approach:**\n   - Break down \\( n^2 - (n-1)^2 = n + (n-1) = 2n - 1 \\) for odd \\( n \\).\n   - Therefore, for sum of these differences:\n     \\[\n     (2+1) + (4+3) + \\cdots + (100+99) = \\frac{100 \\cdot 101}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Following this result, compute:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{101 \\cdot 100}{2} = 5050\n     \\]\n   - Hence, total green area:\n     \\[\n     5050 \\pi\n     \\]\n\n4. **Total Circle Area:**\n   - Area of outermost circle: \\( 100^2 \\cdot \\pi = 10000\\pi \\).\n\n5. **Recalculate Ratio:**\n   - Ratio is then: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{5050\\pi}{10000\\pi} = \\frac{101}{200}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Correct \\( m/n \\) Expression:**\n   - \\( m = 101 \\), \\( n = 200 \\) such that \\( m+n = 301 \\).\n\n**Conclusion and Verification:**\n\nThe careful reevaluation of the alternating sum confirms our calculations have been corrected, and the ratio is indeed \\(\\frac{101}{200}\\). Thus, the correct answer is \\( \\boxed{301} \\).\n\nThrough revisiting each step, I verified this solution is accurate. Apologies for the oversight earlier, but re-examining the problem from a fresh perspective was crucial in arriving at the correct solution.",
