    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive in and tackle this problem step by step. \n\n### Understanding the Problem:\nWe have five different exponential equations, each equals to 7, and we need to find out which one results in the largest solution for \\(x\\). Given \\(0 < r < 3\\), the equations involve different expressions with \\(r\\). Let's note them down:\n\n- **(A):** \\(3(1 + r)^x = 7\\)\n- **(B):** \\(3(1 + \\frac{r}{10})^x = 7\\)\n- **(C):** \\(3(1 + 2r)^x = 7\\)\n- **(D):** \\(3(1 + \\sqrt{r})^x = 7\\)\n- **(E):** \\(3(1 + \\frac{1}{r})^x = 7\\)\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n1. **Explore how exponents work in equations:** Typically when an expression is raised to a power \\(x\\), the larger the base, the smaller \\(x\\) needs to be to reach a particular value (like 7 here). Conversely, if we want the solution for \\(x\\) to be larger, we should have a smaller base.\n2. **Comparing bases directly:** The focus should be on finding which expression \\((1 + r), (1 + \\frac{r}{10}), (1 + 2r), (1 + \\sqrt{r}), (1 + \\frac{1}{r})\\) has the smallest value for a typical \\(r\\) in the range. The smaller the expression, the larger \\(x\\) will typically be.\n\n### Exploring a Strategy:\nTo solve this problem, I'll compare each base expression for values within the given range \\(0 < r < 3\\). \n\nLet\u2019s compare the coefficients since the equations are normalized to base 3 equaling some number to achieve 7.\n\n- For **(A):** \\( (1 + r) \\)\n- For **(B):** \\( (1 + \\frac{r}{10}) \\)\n- For **(C):** \\( (1 + 2r) \\)\n- For **(D):** \\( (1 + \\sqrt{r}) \\)\n- For **(E):** \\( (1 + \\frac{1}{r}) \\)\n\nInitially comparing these for small values of \\(r\\), such as \\(r=1\\) (somewhere in the center of our range):\n\n- **(A):** \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)\n- **(B):** \\(1 + 0.1 = 1.1\\)\n- **(C):** \\(1 + 2 = 3\\)\n- **(D):** \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)\n- **(E):** \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) \n\nClearly for \\(r = 1\\), (B) \\( (1 + \\frac{r}{10}) = 1.1\\) is the smallest, suggesting (B) yields the largest \\(x\\).\n\n### Verifying with More Extreme Values:\n- **For \\(r \\rightarrow 0\\):**\n  - **(A):** \\(1 + 0 = 1\\)\n  - **(B):** \\(1 + 0 = 1\\)\n  - **(C):** \\(1 + 0 = 1\\)\n  - **(D):** \\(1 + 0 = 1\\)\n  - **(E):** \\(1 + \\text{undefined/very large} \\)\n\n- **For \\(r = 2.999\\):**\n  - **(A):** \\(1 + 2.999 = 3.999\\)\n  - **(B):** \\(1 + 0.2999 \\approx 1.2999\\)\n  - **(C):** \\(1 + 5.998 = 6.998\\) \n  - **(D):** \\(1 + \\sqrt{2.999} \\approx 1 + 1.732 = 2.732\\)\n  - **(E):** \\(1 + \\frac{1}{2.999} \\approx 1.3336\\)\n\nAgain, **(B)** remains the smallest.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLooking at the outcomes for different \\(r\\), the base in equation (B), \\(1 + \\frac{r}{10}\\), is consistently the smallest, meaning for the same equation setup, (B) will generally result in the largest \\(x\\). This was confirmed both in small and almost maximum \\(r\\) scenarios, confidently suggesting that the answer is option **(B)**.\n\nReflecting on this solution and considering potential errors, it feels robust due to consistent evaluation from different \\(r\\) extremes. Thus, the equation with the largest solution for \\(x\\) is:\n\n**(B) 3(1 + \\frac{r}{10})^x = 7**",

  "ground_truth": "Intuitively, $x$ will be largest for the option for which the value in the parentheses is smallest.\n\nFormally, first note that each of the values in parentheses is larger than $1$. Now, each of the options is of the form $3f(r)^x = 7$. This can be rewritten as $x\\log f(r) = \\log\\frac 73$. As $f(r)>1$, we have $\\log f(r)>0$. Thus $x$ is the largest for the option for which $\\log f(r)$ is smallest. As $\\log f(r)$ is an increasing function, this is the option for which $f(r)$ is smallest.\n\nWe now get the following easier problem: Given that $0<r<3$, find the smallest value in the set $\\{ 1+r, 1+r/10, 1+2r, 1+\\sqrt r, 1+1/r\\}$.\n\nClearly, $1+r/10$ is smaller than the first and the third option.\n\nWe have $r^2 < 10$, so dividing both sides by $10r$, we get $r/10 < 1/r$.\n\nFinally, $r/100 < 1$, therefore $r^2/100 < r$. Since both sides are positive, we can take the square root and get $r/10 < \\sqrt r$.\n\nThus the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(B)}} 3(1 + r/10)^x = 7$."
