    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem systematically, reflecting on each step. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nOur task is to find the ratio of the complements of two angles given that the angles themselves are complementary and their measures' ratio is 7 to 23. \n\n- **Complementary angles** are two angles whose measures add up to 90 degrees. \n- We're given that angle A and B have a ratio of 7:23. \n- We need to find the ratio of their complements.\n\nFirst thought: Since their measures add up to 90 degrees, this looks like a problem where we could use algebra to express complements based on their given ratio.\n\n### Step 2: Setting Up Equations\nLet's define:\n- \\( A = 7x \\)\n- \\( B = 23x \\)\n\nWhy? Because the ratio of \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) is 7 to 23, so using a common variable \\( x \\) will help express them both.\n\nNow, since they are complementary:\n\\[ A + B = 90 \\]\nSubstituting in the expressions for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):\n\\[ 7x + 23x = 90 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\( x \\)\nCombine the terms:\n\\[ 30x = 90 \\]\nNow, solving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{90}{30} = 3 \\]\n\nThis value of \\( x \\) helps us find the measures for angles A and B:\n- \\( A = 7x = 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\) degrees\n- \\( B = 23x = 23 \\times 3 = 69 \\) degrees\n\nLet me quickly check: \\( 21 + 69 = 90 \\) degrees. Yes! Our values satisfy the condition of being complementary. That's a relief!\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Complements\n- The complement of angle A is: \\( 90 - A = 90 - 21 = 69 \\) degrees\n- The complement of angle B is: \\( 90 - B = 90 - 69 = 21 \\) degrees\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Ratio of Complements\nThe ratio of the complement of angle A to the complement of angle B:\n\\[ \\frac{69}{21} \\]\n\nHmm, let's simplify this:\n\n### Step 6: Simplifying the Ratio\nTo simplify \\( \\frac{69}{21} \\), let's divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\nThe GCD of 69 and 21 is 3 (quick division check helped me spot this). So:\n\\[ \\frac{69}{21} = \\frac{69 \\div 3}{21 \\div 3} = \\frac{23}{7} \\]\n\n### Final Check: Analyze the Result\n- We\u2019ve started by expressing angles in terms of a variable fitting their ratio.\n- Solved for each angle and checked they conform to the complementary condition.\n- Found their complements and derived their ratio, which reduces to a surprisingly elegant result.\n\nThe process seems consistent and solutions match all conditions given in the problem. Thus, the ratio of the complement of angle A to the complement of angle B is \\( \\frac{23}{7} \\).\n\nThis reminds me of how often complementary angles and ratios provide neat solutions. A satisfying result!",

  "ground_truth": "The complement of angle $A$ is just $B$, and the complement of $B$ is $A$.  So we seek the ratio of $B$ to $A$, which is reciprocal of $A$ to $B$, or just $\\boxed{\\frac{23}{7}}$."
