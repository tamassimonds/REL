    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this question. We're trying to find the length of a segment with endpoints \\((1, 2)\\) and \\((-4, -10)\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst, let's think about what the question is asking. We're given two points in a coordinate plane, and we need to find the distance between them. My initial thought reminds me of the distance formula from geometry, which is used to find the distance between two points on a plane. This looks like a straightforward application of that formula.\n\n### Step 2: The Distance Formula\nThe distance formula comes to mind. It\u2019s a direct application of the Pythagorean theorem: \\(d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\). It calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the horizontal and vertical differences between the points. This seems like the perfect approach to find the distance between the two points. \n\n### Step 3: Applying the Formula\nLet's identify our points. We have:\n\n- \\( (x_1, y_1) = (1, 2) \\)\n- \\( (x_2, y_2) = (-4, -10) \\)\n\nNow let's plug these into the formula:\n\n\\[ \nd = \\sqrt{((-4) - 1)^2 + ((-10) - 2)^2} \n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \nd = \\sqrt{((-4) - 1)^2 + ((-10) - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(-5)^2 + (-12)^2} \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nd = \\sqrt{25 + 144} \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nd = \\sqrt{169} \n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying and Double Checking\nThe square root of 169 is 13, since \\(13^2 = 169\\). So, it looks like the distance is 13 units.\n\nLet's do a quick check. I calculated \\((-4) - 1\\) as \\(-5\\) and \\((-10) - 2\\) as \\(-12\\), which seems correct. Squaring \\(-5\\) gives 25 and squaring \\(-12\\) gives 144. Adding them gives 169, which seems right.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe distance between the points \\((1, 2)\\) and \\((-4, -10)\\) is \\(13\\) units. I feel confident about this answer because the calculations follow logically from the distance formula, and everything checks out with a little recalculating.\n\nThis solution path makes sense given the structure of the problem, and no unforeseen pitfalls emerged during the calculation. This seems to have been the simplest and most straightforward method for finding the distance in this scenario.",
