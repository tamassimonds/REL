    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into solving this problem step by step, keeping in mind that I should reflect and brainstorm different strategies as they come to me.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe expression to evaluate is \\(\\left\\lceil\\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^2\\right\\rceil^2\\).\n\nFirst thoughts: Okay, the expression has a ceiling function \\(\\lceil x \\rceil\\), where we round up to the nearest integer, and it is squared. I need to square \\(\\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)\\) first, then apply the ceiling function to the result, and finally square that result. This seems approachable, but I need to be careful with the ceiling function, especially with what value I end up rounding.\n\nHmm, should I write down different possibilities? Maybe not at this stage, but exploring different structural manipulations of the expression might help later.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Inner Expression**\n\nLet's calculate \\(\\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^2\\).\n\n- \\(\\frac{7}{4} = 1.75\\). If I square this number:\n- \\((1.75)^2 = 1.75 \\times 1.75 = 3.0625\\).\n\nOkay, let me pause and reflect briefly: Since it's a decimal less than the next integer, the ceiling function \\(\\lceil 3.0625 \\rceil\\) should round up to the next whole number. \n\n**Step 3: Apply the Ceiling Function**\n\n\\(\\lceil 3.0625 \\rceil = 4\\).\n\nWait, pause. That makes sense\u2014it naturally rounds up. This check feels correct since the fractional component (.0625) ensures rounding up to the next whole number.\n\n**Step 4: Square the Ceiling Result**\n\nNow, take the result from the ceiling function and square it: \\(4^2\\).\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n- \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\).\n\nChecking my logic for a minute: So, I went from \\((\\frac{7}{4})^2\\) to 3.0625 through squaring, applied the ceiling to get 4 (felt right), and finally squared to get 16 (feels like a straightforward multiplication).\n\n**Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nLooking back, every step seems logical and correct following the order of operations described. The initial setup, calculation of inner values, rounding using the ceiling, and final squaring checked out mathematically.\n\nTherefore, \\(\\left\\lceil\\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^2\\right\\rceil^2 = 16\\).\n\nFeeling quite confident about this solution. Every part of this process flowed naturally, and I\u2019m not seeing any glaring errors after reflection.",

  "ground_truth": "Because $\\left(\\frac{7}{4}\\right)^2$ equals $\\frac{49}{16}$, the expression can be rewritten as $\\left\\lceil\\frac{49}{16}\\right\\rceil^2$. The smallest integer greater than $\\frac{49}{16}$ is $4$, and $4^2=\\boxed{16}$."
