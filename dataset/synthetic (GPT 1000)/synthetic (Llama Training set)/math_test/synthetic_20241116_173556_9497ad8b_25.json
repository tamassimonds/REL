    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We are given two equations:\n\n1. \\(2x - 3y = 8\\)\n2. \\(4x + 3y = -2\\)\n\nOur goal is to find the product \\(xy\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nWhen I see these two equations, they remind me of a system of linear equations where we have two unknowns, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and we need to solve for these. I have tackled similar problems before using substitution or elimination methods. Hmm, let me consider the strategy here.\n\n**Strategizing:**\n- Substitution: Solve one equation for one variable and substitute it into the other. This could work, but looking at these equations, I'll end up with fractions, which sometimes make calculations cumbersome.\n- Elimination: Add or subtract the equations to cancel one of the variables. This seems like a straightforward option to try first; the coefficients of \\(y\\) are already set up to cancel each other out when added!\n\nLet's try elimination first. It seems more straightforward because I notice that adding the two equations immediately eliminates \\(y\\).\n\n**Step 1: Eliminate \\(y\\) by Adding Equations**\nAdd:\n\\[\n(2x - 3y) + (4x + 3y) = 8 + (-2)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n6x = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Solve for \\(x\\)**\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\\[\nx = 1\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\(x = 1\\), let's substitute back to find \\(y\\).\n\n**Step 3: Substitute \\(x = 1\\) into the First Equation**\nSubstitute into \\(2x - 3y = 8\\):\n\\[\n2(1) - 3y = 8\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n2 - 3y = 8\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\(y\\)**\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\\[\n-3y = 6\n\\]\n\nDivide by \\(-3\\):\n\\[\ny = -2\n\\]\n\n**Product Calculation:**\nNow we have \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = -2\\). The product \\(xy\\) is:\n\\[\nxy = 1 \\times (-2) = -2\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\nLet's quickly plug these values back into the second equation to ensure they satisfy both:\nIn \\(4x + 3y = -2\\),\n\\[\n4(1) + 3(-2) = 4 - 6 = -2\n\\]\n\nYes, both equations are satisfied with these values. \n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe solution makes sense; everything checks out. The product \\(xy\\) is indeed \\(-2\\). Reflecting on the approach, elimination worked efficiently in this case, reducing the complexity with minimal steps.",

  "ground_truth": "Adding the two equations gives $6x = 6$, so $x=1$.  Substituting this into the first equation gives $2 - 3y = 8$.  Solving for $y$ gives $y=-2$, so $xy = \\boxed{-2}$."
