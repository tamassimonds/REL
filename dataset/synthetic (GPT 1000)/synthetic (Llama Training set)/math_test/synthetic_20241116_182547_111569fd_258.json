    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and really think it through step by step. The expression we need to simplify is \\(3!(2^3 + \\sqrt{9}) \\div 2\\).\n\n### First Thoughts\n\nInitially, I notice the expression involves factorials, powers, and a square root. The presence of \\(3!\\) (3 factorial) means we'll be dealing with multiplication of consecutive integers. The \\((2^3 + \\sqrt{9})\\) part looks like it's about simplifying individual components before tackling the division by 2.\n\n### Exploring the Expression\n\n1. **Understand and Simplify Factorial:**\n\n   - \\(3!\\) is \\(3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\\). \n   - This looks straightforward. Always good to start simple. \n   \n   So, \\[3! = 6.\\]\n\n2. **Simplify the Power Expression \\(2^3\\):**\n\n   - \\(2^3\\) signifies 2 raised to the power of 3: \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\\).\n   - Ah, this makes sense. Seems simple enough.\n\n   So, \\[2^3 = 8.\\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Square Root \\(\\sqrt{9}\\):**\n\n   - \\(\\sqrt{9}\\) is a common square root: 9 is a perfect square.\n   - Wait, this should just be 3 because \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n   \n   Thus, \\[\\sqrt{9} = 3.\\]\n\n4. **Add the Simplified Components Together:**\n\n   - Now, take the expressions we've simplified: \\(2^3 + \\sqrt{9}\\) becomes \\(8 + 3\\).\n   - Adding these gives us 11. Let's double-check this... yes, \\(8 + 3 = 11\\).\n\n   Therefore, \\[2^3 + \\sqrt{9} = 11.\\]\n\n5. **Multiply by the Factorial:**\n\n   - Our expression now is: \\(3!(2^3 + \\sqrt{9})\\) simplifies to \\(6 \\times 11\\).\n   - Do the multiplication: \\(6 \\times 11\\) gives 66.\n\n   Hence, \\[3!(2^3 + \\sqrt{9}) = 66.\\]\n\n6. **Divide by 2:**\n\n   - Lastly, divide the result by 2: \\(66 \\div 2\\).\n   - Let's think through this... halving 66 gives 33.\n\n   So, \\[66 \\div 2 = 33.\\]\n\n### Final Reflection\n\nTaking stock of what I did: simplified factorial, power, square root, then applied arithmetic operations. It seems consistent and logical, and I've checked calculations at each step. Everything feels correct, and given that I've done a mix of mental checks and direct calculations, the final answer to \\(3!(2^3 + \\sqrt{9}) \\div 2\\) is definitely:\n\n\\[\\boxed{33}.\\]\n\nRemember to always question each stage; doing so not only helps in mathematics but in breaking down any complex problem logically.",
