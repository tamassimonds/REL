    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step and let our thinking flow naturally.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- Hmm, we have an isosceles triangle here, as \\(PQ = QR = 34\\). It's always helpful to note when a triangle is isosceles because it can lead to some simplifications.\n- We're tasked with finding the length of a median, \\(\\overline{QM}\\). Medians can be tricky sometimes, but they also have nice properties, like bisecting the opposite side or relating to centroids. Here, we know \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(PR\\).\n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n- One common way to find the length of a median is by using Apollonius's theorem. It relates the side lengths of a triangle to the length of a median. Might be worth exploring.\n- Alternatively, we could try coordinate geometry as a fallback. Place the triangle on a coordinate plane and use distance formulas. Could be cumbersome, but is usually reliable.\n\n**Let's Try Apollonius's Theorem:**\n- Apollonius's theorem states: For a triangle \\(ABC\\), with median \\(AM\\), the theorem is given by \\(AB^2 + AC^2 = 2AM^2 + \\frac{1}{2}BC^2\\).\n- Applying it to \\(\\triangle PQR\\): We let \\(M\\) be the midpoint of \\(PR\\). Thus, \\(PM = MR = \\frac{32}{2} = 16\\).\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\\[PQ^2 + QR^2 = 2(QM^2) + 2(PM^2)\\]\n\\[34^2 + 34^2 = 2(QM^2) + 2(16^2)\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n- First calculate each term: \n  - \\(34^2 = 1156\\),\n  - \\(16^2 = 256\\).\n  \n\\[1156 + 1156 = 2(QM^2) + 2(256)\\]\n\nSo, \n\\[2312 = 2(QM^2) + 512\\]\n\nSubtract 512:\n\\[2312 - 512 = 2(QM^2)\\]\n\\[1800 = 2(QM^2)\\]\n\nNow, divide by 2:\n\\[QM^2 = 900\\]\n\nTake the square root to find \\(QM\\):\n\\[QM = \\sqrt{900} = 30\\]\n\n**Check the Work:**\n- Does this make sense given the problem? \n- \\(QM = 30\\) seems reasonable when compared to the side lengths of the triangle.\n- The arithmetic checks out and follows the application of Apollonius's theorem correctly.\n\n**Reflect:**\n- Using Apollonius\u2019s theorem led us smoothly to the solution without the messiness of coordinate geometry.\n- Everything aligns with the properties of median lengths in a triangle.\n\nThus, the length of the median \\(\\overline{QM}\\) is \\(30\\).",
