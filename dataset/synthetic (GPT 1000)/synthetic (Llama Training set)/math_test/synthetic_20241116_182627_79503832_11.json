    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nFirst off, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. We're dealing with an arithmetic sequence where the product of the first and third terms is 5, and we need to find the fourth term. All terms are positive integers. Hmm, this seems to be a constrained sequence problem where we have a specific product condition. \n\n**Step 2: Representation and Brainstorming**\nAn arithmetic sequence can be represented as: \n- First term: \\(a\\)\n- Second term: \\(a + d\\)\n- Third term: \\(a + 2d\\)\n- Fourth term: \\(a + 3d\\)\n\nThe condition given is \\(a(a + 2d) = 5\\). This seems like a good starting point to try and find possibilities for \\(a\\) and \\(d\\).\n\n**Step 3: Exploring Possible Values for \\(a\\) and \\(d\\)**\nSince \\(a(a + 2d) = 5\\), and all terms are positive integers, let's think about what pairs \\((a, a + 2d)\\) multiply to give 5, considering the sequence are integers.\n\n1. If \\(a = 1\\), then \\(a + 2d = 5\\). Solving for \\(d\\), we get \\(1 + 2d = 5\\), which simplifies to \\(2d = 4\\) so \\(d = 2\\).\n\n   Let's check: \n   - First term: 1\n   - Third term: 1 + 2(2) = 5\n   - Product: \\(1 \\times 5 = 5\\) \u2713\n\n2. If \\(a = 5\\), then \\(a + 2d = 1\\), but this doesn't work since \\(a + 2d\\) would have to be smaller than \\(a\\) which can't happen in an arithmetic sequence with positive integer terms.\n\nSo, my working values are \\(a = 1\\) and \\(d = 2\\).\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Fourth Term**\nWith \\(a = 1\\) and \\(d = 2\\), now find the fourth term:\n- Fourth term = \\(a + 3d = 1 + 3(2) = 1 + 6 = 7\\).\n\n**Step 5: Reflection and Verification**\nLet's quickly recap:\n- All terms are positive integers, check.\n- The product condition is satisfied with \\(1\\) and \\(5\\), check.\n- Fourth term computed as 7, check.\n\nEverything seems to align well. \n\nWait, let's double-check:\n- First term = 1\n- Third term = 5\n- Both positive integers, product is 5, terms align as 1, 3, 5, 7... which fits an arithmetic sequence. \n\n**Conclusion**\nAll steps confirm the fourth term of the sequence is 7. \n\nOh! This reminds me of checking for all possible pairs for small numbers might be helpful just like solving algebraic identities. The approach seems straightforward for this specific limitation of positive product and integer terms.",

  "ground_truth": "The only way that 5 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers is as $5 = 1 \\times 5$.  Therefore, the first and third terms are 1 and 5, in some order.  Since all the terms in the sequence are positive integers, the common difference must be nonnegative, so the first term is 1, and the third term is 5.\n\nThen the second term is the average of the first term (namely 1) and the third term (namely 5), or $(1 + 5)/2 = 3$.  Therefore, the common difference is $3 - 1 = 2$, and the fourth term is $5 + 2 = \\boxed{7}$."
