    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: Evaluating \\(\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}} 125\\).\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thought: This looks like a logarithm problem. The base of the logarithm is \\(\\sqrt[3]{5}\\) and we are looking for the power to which we must raise \\(\\sqrt[3]{5}\\) to get 125. \n\nHmm, \\(\\sqrt[3]{5}\\) is not a standard base like 10 or 2, so I'll need to be careful with it. Similarly, 125, although a neat number, might need some manipulation to make this easier.\n\n**Step 2: Consider Different Strategies**\n\n- One strategy could be to express both the base and the number 125 in terms of exponentials that might simplify the calculation.\n- Another approach could be to convert the logarithm to a different base, like using base 10 or natural logs, but let's hold that thought for now.\n\n**Step 3: Express Both Parts in Terms of Exponents**\n\nFirst, \\(\\sqrt[3]{5}\\) can be rewritten as \\(5^{1/3}\\).\n\n125 is a recognizable number. I think it's \\(5^3\\) because \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\\).\n\nSo now, I've transformed the original problem: \\(\\log_{5^{1/3}} 5^3\\).\n\n**Step 4: Use Logarithm Rules**\n\nAha, a rule comes to mind: \\(\\log_b (a^n) = n \\cdot \\log_b a\\) and \\(\\log_{b^m} a = \\frac{1}{m} \\log_b a\\).\n\nLet me apply them here:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{5^{1/3}} 5^3 = \\frac{1}{1/3} \\cdot \\log_5 (5^3)\n\\]\n\nOkay, next I\u2019ll simplify this:\n- \\(\\frac{1}{1/3}\\) is simply 3.\n- \\(\\log_5 (5^3)\\) is straightforward too, since \\(\\log_b (b^n) = n\\), yielding 3.\n\nCombine these:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1/3} \\cdot 3 = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Verification**\n\nHmm, let's verify my approach makes sense, and quickly check it for errors.\n\nBy the laws of logarithms, if we take \\(\\log_{x} a = y\\), then \\(x^y = a\\). Here, if I got 9, then \\((5^{1/3})^9\\) should give me 125.\n\nSimplifying \\((5^{1/3})^9 = 5^{(1/3) \\times 9} = 5^3 = 125\\).\n\nThis aligns perfectly! My result seems correct.\n\n**Wrap-Up**\n\nThe \\(\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}} 125\\) equals 9. I feel confident in this solution, and the verification confirmed the steps I took. It was useful to express everything as an exponential before applying log rules. \n\nAll done, and I didn\u2019t encounter any conflicting insights or deeper doubts throughout. Happy with this.",

  "ground_truth": "We set  $\\log_{\\sqrt[3]{5}}125=x$, so we have $\\sqrt[3]{5}^x=125$. Expressing both sides as powers of $5$, we have $(5^{\\frac{1}{3}})^x=5^3$, or $5^{\\frac{x}{3}}=5^3$. Thus $\\frac{x}{3}=3$ and $\\boxed{x=9}$."
