  "problem": "A class of 25 students includes the Smith quadruplets.  The teacher must select two students from the class to represent the class in the school's student government.  Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step.\n\nFirst thoughts:\n- At first glance, this feels like a probability problem, dealing with combinations. I remember something about choosing members from a group, which involves combinations or \"n choose k\" scenarios.\n- I'm immediately considering how to calculate the probability of a specific subgroup (the Smith quadruplets) being chosen out of a larger group (the class of 25 students).\n\nLet's start brainstorming:\n- The problem is asking for the probability that both representatives are part of the Smith quadruplets.\n- There are 4 Smith quadruplets, and the total number of students is 25.\n- Choosing combinations without regard to order sounds like the right approach, using \"n choose k\".\n\nBreaking it down:\n1. **What are total possible ways to choose 2 students from 25?**\n   - This involves combinations since the order in which we choose doesn't matter.\n   - Using the combinations formula: \\( \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\)\n   - For \\( n = 25 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\), the calculations would be:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{25}{2} = \\frac{25 \\times 24}{2 \\times 1} = 300\n     \\]\n   - So, there are 300 ways to choose any two students from 25.\n\n2. **How many ways to choose 2 Smith quadruplets?**\n   - Now, we are only looking at the Smith quadruplets, and we need to choose 2 out of the 4.\n   - Using the same combinations formula with \\( n = 4 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n     \\]\n   - There are 6 ways to choose 2 students from the Smith quadruplets.\n\n3. **Calculating the probability:**\n   - Probability is defined as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n   - Here, the favorable outcomes (choosing 2 Smith quadruplets) is 6, and the total outcomes (choosing any 2 students from 25) is 300.\n   - Therefore, the probability \\( P \\) is:\n     \\[\n     P = \\frac{6}{300} = \\frac{1}{50}\n     \\]\n\nChecking my work:\n- The number \\( 300 \\) as total ways to choose 2 out of 25 feels reasonable, considering the formula application.\n- The approach using combinations for both the total possibilities and specifically for the Smiths seems solid.\n- The probability \\( \\frac{1}{50} \\) or 2% seems like a reasonable chance given the small number of quadruplets compared to the whole class.\n\nReflecting:\n- Each action seems to logically follow the previous one, leading to a coherent and consistent result.\n- Missteps have been corrected by rechecking calculations using the formulas, ensuring no mistakes were made.\n\nUltimately, our probability of selecting two Smith quadruplets randomly is \\(\\frac{1}{50}\\), or 2%. This makes sense given the setup of the problem.",

  "ground_truth": "There are ${25 \\choose 2} = 300$ possible pairs of student representatives. Of these, since there are 4 Smith quadruplets, there are ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs in which both representatives are Smith quadruplets. So, the probability of both representatives being Smith quadruplets is $\\frac{6}{300} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$."
