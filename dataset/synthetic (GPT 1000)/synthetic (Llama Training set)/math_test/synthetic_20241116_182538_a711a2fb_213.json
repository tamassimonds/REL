    "working_out": "Alright, let's think about the problem: \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- We need to find the positive even perfect cubes less than 2008. \n- Perfect cubes are numbers like \\(1^3, 2^3, 3^3,\\) etc. But we only want the even ones.\n- So only numbers like \\(2^3, 4^3, 6^3,...\\) will be relevant.\n- Our task is to find out how many of such numbers exist which are less than 2008.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n- The straightforward approach could be to calculate the perfect cubes of even numbers until the cube exceeds 2008.\n- This will involve a bit of calculation.\n\n**Step-by-step Calculations:**\n1. **Start with small numbers:**\n   - \\(2^3 = 8\\). This is even and less than 2008.\n   - \\(4^3 = 64\\). This is even and less than 2008.\n   - \\(6^3 = 216\\). This is even and less than 2008.\n   - \\(8^3 = 512\\). Again, even and less than 2008.\n   - \\(10^3 = 1000\\). This works too.\n   - \\(12^3 = 1728\\). Still good, fits the criteria.\n   - \\(14^3 = 2744\\). Uh oh, this is greater than 2008.\n\n2. **Pause and Reflect:**\n   - So checking numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, we've found all the perfect cubes that fit the criteria.\n   - \\(14^3\\) is already beyond the limit, meaning \\(12^3\\) was the last one we could use.\n\n3. **Double-Check:**\n   - Before concluding, it's good to re-evaluate the logic and calculations quickly to ensure accuracy.\n   - I calculated each cube distinctly and ensured none were skipped.\n   - The logic of focusing on even numbers only also checks out.\n\n**Reassess Strategy:**\n- The calculation approach seems sound, as we incrementally calculated until we surpassed the target number, ensuring thorough coverage of the even perfect cubes up to 2008.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Count of cubes up to \\(12^3\\) that are even: \\(2^3, 4^3, 6^3, 8^3, 10^3, 12^3\\).\n- That's a total of 6 numbers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are 6 positive even perfect cubes that are less than 2008.",
