    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. \n\n**Brainstorming Session:**\n\nFirst, let's unpack what's given in the problem:\n- We're working with triangle \\( ABC \\).\n- \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are midpoints of \\( BC \\) and \\( AC \\) respectively.\n- Perpendicular bisectors of \\( BC \\) and \\( AC \\) intersect at point \\( O \\).\n- Inside the triangle, we need to find \\(\\angle MON\\) given \\(\\angle C = 47^\\circ\\).\n\nOkay. Initially, this reminds me of the properties of perpendicular bisectors and the use of midpoints, which often involves some symmetry and can tap into isosceles triangles. \n\nI remember a result about perpendicular bisectors intersecting inside a triangle at the circumcenter, but we are not guaranteeing this point is at the circumcenter since these bisectors are specific to segments \\( BC \\) and \\( AC \\). Moreover, \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) being midpoints calls to mind a possible use of median properties or other midpoint-related theorems.\n\n**Exploring Possible Approaches:**\n\n1. **Understanding Geometry:**\n   \\( O \\) is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of \\( BC \\) and \\( AC\\), which suggests that \\( O \\) is equidistant from \\( B \\) and \\( C \\), and also equidistant from \\( A \\) and \\( C \\). This gives us isosceles triangles \\( OBC \\) and \\( OAC\\).\n\n2. **Using the Angles:**\n   Since we know \\(\\angle C = 47^\\circ\\), and \\( O \\) being equidistant forms isosceles triangles, maybe there's something with reflecting over the bisectors.\n\n3. **Visualizing with Midpoints:**\n   Because \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are midpoints, that gives \\( BM = MC\\) and \\( AN = NC\\).\n\n4. **Exploring \\(\\angle MON\\):**\n   Since we are interested in \\(\\angle MON\\), checking if \\( O \\) serves any role like in a special triangle containing such angles might help.\n\n**Plan to Solve:**\n\n- Let's draw line segments \\( OM \\) and \\( ON\\) since \\( O \\) is on perpendicular bisectors. \n- Consider what it means geometrically for the lines to form \\( \\angle MON\\).\n  \n**Let's Start with Calculations:**\n\n1. **Calculate or Analyze Isosceles Triangles:**\n   \\[ \\angle OCB = \\angle OBC, \\quad \\angle OAC = \\angle OCA \\]\n\n2. **Identify the Relationship of Angles around \\( \\angle C \\):**\n   Using the property of isosceles triangles and knowing \\( \\angle C = 47^\\circ \\), the situation doesn't instantaneously give clear angles at \\( O\\), so let's think about potential symmetry or cyclic properties.\n\n3. **Recognizing the configuration of the Ceva's theorem or median theorem:**\n   The use of midpoints means segments connecting midpoints and vertices might imply angle bisectors. Typically, \\(\\angle BMC\\) helps determine internal angles at medians, possibly involving perpendicular bisectors.\n\n**Ah, Inspiration Strikes!**\n\n- \\(\\triangle ABC\\) with \\( M \\) and \\( N\\) both midpoints: notice any line through medians parallel to a side bisects the opposite angle because we are in symmetry: What if \\( O \\) intersects such line symmetry, like a lattice structure?\n\nHowever, I realize it's not straightaway yielding an answer... usually if directly simplifying works it urges a direct conclusion.\n\n**Try Another Tactic:**\nReturning to the beginning, angle chasing using isosceles triangles seems needed.\n\n**Revisitation of Angle Conditions & Chord Theorems:**\n\n- Consider circle geometry, cyclic symmetries around \\( O \\) since the actual information of a midpoint aids simple drawing understandings highlighting symmetry:\n  \\((\\angle OMC) = \\text{Reflexive property in drawing due to bisecting roles captured}\\)\n\n**Refocusing on \\(\\angle MON\\)**:\nUse the internal equilibrium of angles through symmetry, as shown in reflections:\n- The final turn of geometry deduction:\n  \n  \\[\n    \\angle MON = 90^\\circ - \\frac{47^\\circ}{2} = 90^\\circ - 23.5^\\circ = 66.5^\\circ\n  \\]\n\nBut this deviation led me wrong reflecting that wasn't based rightly, as through symmetry angle \\(MON\\) concludes instead as:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90^\\circ}\n\\]\n\nRealizing the geometric middle in balanced role fosters whole conditions conceptually in triangle position involving \\(60^\\circ+30^\\circ\\) through same divisor conditions on metrics of medians/bisectors role.\n\nKeep verifying through revisiting geometry and checking core logic until the satisfaction meets increasing clear insight.\n\nAh, I see where I went wrong in my previous approach. Let's revisit the problem and go through it again with a fresh perspective.\n\n**Brainstorming and Revisiting the Problem:**\n\nGiven:\n- Triangle \\( ABC \\) with \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) as midpoints of \\( BC \\) and \\( AC \\), respectively.\n- The perpendicular bisectors of \\( BC \\) and \\( AC \\) intersect at \\( O \\).\n- We need to find \\(\\angle MON\\) with \\(\\angle C = 47^\\circ\\).\n\n**Revisiting Geometric Properties:**\n\n1. **Perpendicular Bisectors and Their Properties:**\n   The perpendicular bisectors of a segment in a triangle suggest that \\( O \\) is equidistant from the endpoints of each segment. Thus, \\( O \\) is equidistant from \\( B \\) and \\( C \\), and from \\( A \\) and \\( C \\).\n\n2. **Exploring Quadrilateral Configuration:**\n   Given that \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are midpoints, let's explore the quadrilateral \\( MONC \\).\n\n**Re-evaluating \\(\\angle MON\\):**\n\n- **Quadrilateral \\( MONC\\):**\n  In quadrilateral \\( MONC \\), let's check the angle relationships:\n  - We note \\( \\angle OMC \\) and \\( \\angle ONC \\) are both right angles (\\(90^\\circ\\)), as \\( O \\) lies on the perpendicular bisectors.\n  - The sum of angles in any quadrilateral is \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\nGiven:\n  \\[\n  \\angle OMC + \\angle ONC + \\angle MON + \\angle MCN = 360^\\circ\n  \\]\n\nSimplify using known angles:\n  \\[\n  90^\\circ + 90^\\circ + \\angle MON + \\angle MCN = 360^\\circ\n  \\]\n\nThus:\n  \\[\n  \\angle MON + \\angle MCN = 180^\\circ\n  \\]\n\n**Using the Given \\(\\angle C:\\)**\n\nSince \\(\\angle MCN\\) mirrors \\( \\angle C = 47^\\circ\\) due to symmetric properties (given \\( M \\) is the midpoint), we have:\n  \\[\n  \\angle MON = 180^\\circ - \\angle MCN = 180^\\circ - 47^\\circ = 133^\\circ\n  \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThus, the measure of \\(\\angle MON\\) is \\(\\boxed{133^\\circ}\\).\n\nReflecting on this, the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors and midpoints naturally leads to the configuration where angles and symmetry yield this solution. This revelation aligns well with the geometric properties explored.\n\nAh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's revisit the problem and think it through more carefully.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Problem:**\n\nWe have triangle \\( ABC \\) with \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) as the midpoints of \\( BC \\) and \\( AC \\), respectively. The perpendicular bisectors of \\( BC \\) and \\( AC \\) intersect at \\( O \\). We need to find the measure of \\(\\angle MON\\) given \\(\\angle C = 47^\\circ\\).\n\n**Let's Start By Reconsidering the Geometry:**\n\n1. **Perpendicular Bisectors and Properties:**\n\n   - The perpendicular bisector of any segment is a line that divides the segment into two equal parts at a right angle and is equidistant from the endpoints of the segment. \n\n   - This means point \\( O \\) is equidistant from \\( B \\) and \\( C \\), as well as from \\( A \\) and \\( C \\).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Quadrilateral \\( MONC \\):**\n\n   - \\( O \\) lies on the perpendicular bisectors of \\( BC \\) and \\( AC \\), which implies \\(\\angle OMC = \\angle ONC = 90^\\circ\\).\n\n   - Therefore, in the quadrilateral \\( MONC \\), the sum of angles is \\(360^\\circ\\). We have:\n     \\[\n     \\angle OMC + \\angle ONC + \\angle MON + \\angle MCN = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n     Substituting the known right angles:\n     \\[\n     90^\\circ + 90^\\circ + \\angle MON + \\angle MCN = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solving for \\(\\angle MON\\):**\n\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\angle MON + \\angle MCN = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n   - Since \\(\\angle MCN\\) corresponds to \\(\\angle C\\) due to the symmetry of the bisectors and midpoints, \\(\\angle MCN = 47^\\circ\\).\n\n   - Therefore, the measure of \\(\\angle MON\\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\angle MON = 180^\\circ - 47^\\circ = 133^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThus, the measure of \\(\\angle MON\\) is \\(\\boxed{133^\\circ}\\). This re-evaluation confirms the geometric configuration and angle relationships within the quadrilateral \\( MONC \\). By carefully re-examining the properties of perpendicular bisectors and the symmetry in the problem, I've arrived at the correct solution.",
