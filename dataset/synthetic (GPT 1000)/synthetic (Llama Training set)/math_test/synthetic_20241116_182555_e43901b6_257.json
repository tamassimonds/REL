    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step and explore our thoughts and strategies as we go. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- We have a unit square \\(ABCD\\), and we need to find the distance between the vertices of a hyperbola.\n- The hyperbola's foci are at the midpoints of \\(\\overline{AB}\\) and \\(\\overline{CD}\\). \n- The hyperbola passes through all the vertices of the square. This setup seems symmetric, which might help in identifying key properties of the hyperbola.\n\n**Initial Strategy Consideration:**\n- My first thought is to work on identifying the properties and equation of the hyperbola, as understanding its structure could be key.\n- Since I'm dealing with foci and vertices of a hyperbola, recognizing patterns or using standard hyperbola forms might be helpful.\n\n### Exploring and Confirming Strategy\n\n**Geometric Configuration:**\n- Place the square such that \\(A\\) is at \\((0, 0)\\), \\(B\\) at \\((1, 0)\\), \\(C\\) at \\((1, 1)\\), and \\(D\\) at \\((0, 1)\\). This will simplify our calculations due to symmetry and unit distance.\n- The midpoints: \\(M_1\\) of \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is \\((0.5, 0)\\) and \\(M_2\\) of \\(\\overline{CD}\\) is \\((0.5, 1)\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The equation of a hyperbola typically relates directly to its foci. Based on symmetry about the midline \\(y = 0.5\\), placing the hyperbola along the y-axis seems promising.\n\n### Calculations\n\n**Equation of the Hyperbola:**\n- Considering the hyperbola is centered between the foci, its equation can be written informally as: \n  \\[\n  \\left( y - 0.5 \\right)^2 - k(x - 0.5)^2 = c\n  \\]\n  This indicates the term for vertical orientation since vertices are positioned in the side of y-axis.\n\n**Reflecting on Known Hyperbola Properties:**\n- Substituting the vertices of the square into the hyperbola equation:\n  - For \\((0,0)\\): solve the equality to yield constraints.\n  - For \\((1,0)\\): since it also fits, it confirms possible symmetry.\n  - Vertices \\((1,1)\\) and \\((0,1)\\) provide additional constraints.\n- With midpoint and vertices alignment, realizing \\(c = 0\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Substitute constraints to solve for \\(k\\). After simplification, we find consistency within constraints where:\n  \\[\n  y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\text{(something involving constants)}}\n  \\]\n\n**Solving Vertices Information:**\n- Classic hyperbola leads to equate the vertices offsets:\n  \\[\n  x = 0.5 \\pm \\text{slope expanded from solutions}\n  \\]\n  \n### Evaluate Additional Steps\n\n**Check Correctness:**\n- Reflect on solutions gained from substituting vertices, ensuring the derivation in finding the hyperbola alignment satisfies symmetry and problem constraints. \n- If these don't work right, might trial predefined models.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Conclude with Final Calculation:**\n- After considering geometric symmetry and calculations, the distance was found to align consistently with properties returning sqrt values (related based on unit placements within square dynamics).\n\n**Final Verification with Hyperbola Observation:**\n- Confirms if aligned by attributes of midpoint centrality then derivations complete with realized output placement.\n\nIn summary, sometimes understanding the geometric layout intuitively helps grappling with the task, guiding to solutions through symmetry rather than exhaustive calculations. Feel free to question complex steps; iterating geometry and algebra together exposes interactive problem layouts smoother.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial approach. Let's revisit the problem more carefully and explore different strategies to tackle it.\n\n### Reassessing the Problem\n\n**Reflecting on the Structure:**\n- Initially, we considered symmetric placements and generic hyperbola equations. However, let's refine our approach by focusing more keenly on the hyperbola's geometric properties, particularly its relationship with the foci.\n\n**Key Insight:**\n- The hyperbola described by its foci being midpoints \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) of \\(\\overline{AB}\\) and \\(\\overline{CD}\\) provides a more direct method. \n- It's crucial to recognize that the hyperbola's definition as the set of all points \\( P \\) such that the absolute difference in distances to the foci is constant, \\( |PM - PN| = 2a \\), simplifies the process.\n\n### New Strategy\n\n1. **Identify Vertex Points:**\n   - We know the hyperbola passes through \\( A, B, C, \\) and \\( D \\).\n   - Our goal is to determine the value of \\( 2a \\), which is the distance between the two vertices of the hyperbola. \n\n2. **Substitute Points into Distance Condition:**\n   - Set \\( P = A \\) or \\( P = (0,0) \\) for clarity.\n   - \\( M = (0.5, 0) \\) and \\( N = (0.5, 1) \\).\n\n3. **Calculate Distances:**\n   - The distance \\( AM \\) is simply \\(\\sqrt{(0.5)^2 + 0^2} = 0.5\\).\n   - The distance \\( AN \\) is \\(\\sqrt{(0.5)^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{1.25} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Applying Hyperbola Condition:**\n   - From the definition of the hyperbola: \n     \\[\n     2a = |AM - AN| = \\left| 0.5 - \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right|\n     \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying Expressions:**\n   - Simplify \\(\\left| 0.5 - \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right|\\):\n     \\[\n     = \\left| \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right|\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}\n     \\]\n\n### Verification and Conclusion\n\n**Check Overall Consistency:**\n- The calculation aligns with geometric properties given the hyperbola must exactly span vertices across specified conditions.\n- Recognize midpoints and constraints understanding without complications confirms comprehensively with unit square symmetry.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n- Therefore, the distance between the two vertices of the hyperbola is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}}\\).\n\nBy reconsidering the symmetry and consistency within the hyperbola's conditions relative to the square's vertices, this approach offers clarity in solving the problem accurately. The simple geometric reinterpretation illuminated the correct path.",
