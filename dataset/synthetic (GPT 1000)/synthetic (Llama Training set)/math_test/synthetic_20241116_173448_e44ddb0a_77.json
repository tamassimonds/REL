    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\nWhen I first look at this problem, my mind immediately jumps to the formula for the distance from a point to a plane in three-dimensional space. I remember there is a direct formula, something involving the dot product somehow. But before I jump to conclusions, I should slow down and think about it more carefully to really understand the question.\n\nThe question asks for the distance from a point to a plane. So, the point is given as (2, 1, 0), and the plane is defined by the equation \\(2x + y + 2z + 5 = 0\\). The plane equation is standard with coefficients \\(A = 2\\), \\(B = 1\\), \\(C = 2\\), and \\(D = 5\\).\n\nReflecting on Strategies:\n- One way is to use the geometric formula for distance, but I should derive it from what I know to make sure it applies correctly here.\n- Another approach, if stuck, could be using projections or parametrizing the line directly connecting the point to the plane. However, that seems unnecessarily complex...\n\nChecking the Plane Equation:\nWait, before diving in, let me double-check if the plane equation is correct in my head. It's in the standard form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\), yes, so we can proceed with confidence.\n\nFirst Idea (Formula Approach):\n\n1. **Recall the Distance Formula**:\n   - It's something like \\(\\frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + Cz_1 + D|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}}\\) where \\((x_1, y_1, z_1)\\) is the point in space. \n   - This formula computes the perpendicular (shortest) distance using the plane coefficients.\n   - Let's see if applying it here makes sense.\n\n2. **Plug values into the formula**:\n   - Given point: \\((x_1, y_1, z_1) = (2, 1, 0)\\)\n   - Plane equation: \\(2x + y + 2z + 5 = 0\\)\n   - Apply point to plane equation: \\(2(2) + 1(1) + 2(0) + 5\\)\n\nCalculations:\n\n- Calculate the numerator:\n  \\[\n  2(2) + 1(1) + 2(0) + 5 = 4 + 1 + 0 + 5 = 10\n  \\]\n\n- The absolute value: \\(|10| = 10\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the denominator**:\n   - It's related to normal vector length, \\(\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}\\).\n   - For this plane, it's \\(\\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2 + 2^2}\\).\n\nCalculations:\n\n- Calculate the norm of the normal vector:\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 1 + 4} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n  \\]\n\n4. **Put it all together**:\n   - The distance is \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\).\n\nFinal Reflection:\n- This value of distance \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\) seems reasonable given the context.\n- I used the distance formula correctly, and my arithmetic checks out.\n- Reflecting on the process, the formula approach worked smoothly once I established what parameters to use.\n- No unexpected difficulties arose, which is a good sanity check; the plane equation was suitable and treated correctly.\n\nFinal Answer:  \nThe distance from the point \\((2,1,0)\\) to the plane \\(2x + y + 2z + 5 = 0\\) is \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\). \n\nA neat and successful problem-solving walk!",
