    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it step by step.\n\n**First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we have a classic problem involving sets and overlaps, reminiscent of Venn Diagrams. We need to determine how many people are wearing all three items based on the numbers given for various combinations of these items. My first instinct is, \"This reminds me of those Venn Diagram problems in math class,\" where we had to figure out the intersections of sets, and this seems similar. But let's break it down more and see which strategies might work.\n\n**Understand the Problem**\n\nWe have three groups:\n- Sunglasses (S): 110 people\n- Bathing suits (B): 70 people\n- Hats (H): 95 people\n\nWe know:\n- 30 people are wearing both sunglasses and bathing suits (S \u2229 B).\n- 25 people are wearing both bathing suits and hats (B \u2229 H).\n- 40 people are wearing both sunglasses and hats (S \u2229 H).\n\nEveryone is wearing at least one of these items, and there are 190 people on the beach in total. The question asks how many people are wearing all three items. Hmm, sounds like I should be considering the principle of inclusion-exclusion, which is used when we know the total of overlapping sections.\n\n**Brainstorm and Strategy**\n\nLet's try calculating each part to get a better understanding:\n\n1. **Using Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (IEP)**: This principle helps us in situations where we have overlapping sets. In the context of three sets, the formula can be written as:\n   \\[\n   |S \\cup B \\cup H| = |S| + |B| + |H| - |S \u2229 B| - |B \u2229 H| - |S \u2229 H| + |S \u2229 B \u2229 H|\n   \\]\n   Let\u2019s call the number of people wearing all three items \\(x\\).\n\n   Plugging numbers:\n   \\[\n   190 = 110 + 70 + 95 - 30 - 25 - 40 + x\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Expression**: Let's simplify the expression. \n   - First, add the total count of each group: \n     \\[\n     110 + 70 + 95 = 275\n     \\]\n   - Then, add the overlaps being subtracted: \n     \\[\n     30 + 25 + 40 = 95\n     \\]\n   - Apply those calculations:\n     \\[\n     190 = 275 - 95 + x\n     \\]\n   - Simplify further:\n     \\[\n     190 = 180 + x\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(x\\)**: \n   By subtracting 180 from both sides, we can solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   190 - 180 = x \\implies x = 10\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection and Double-Checking**\n\nThis means \\(x = 10\\) people are wearing all three items. Let's think: does this conclusion make sense? It does seem reasonable given the numbers and that such overlaps often resolve to fairly small numbers when all three are included. These numbers aren't too big or too small given the total of 190 people and the various combinations described. Quick checks at intermediate steps have been consistent, so I feel confident in this solution.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUltimately, using the inclusion-exclusion principle worked perfectly here. From that, we're able to determine that 10 people are wearing all three items: sunglasses, bathing suits, and hats. A logical and tight solution!",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be number of people wearing all three items.  Since 30 people are wearing bathing suits and sunglasses, we know that $30 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and sunglasses.  Similarly, $25 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and hats, while $40 - x$ are wearing just sunglasses and a hat.\n\nTo find the number of people wearing just sunglasses, we subtract the people who are wearing sunglasses with other items from the total number of people wearing sunglasses, which is $110 - (30 - x) - (40 - x) - x = 40 + x$.  Similarly, the number of people wearing just hats is $30 + x$, while the number of people wearing just bathing suits is $15 + x$.\n\nSince the total number of people on the beach is 190, and everyone is wearing one of the items, we have: \\begin{align*}\n190 &= (15 + x) + (40 + x) + (30 + x) \\\\\n&\\qquad+ (25 - x ) + (30 - x) + (40 - x) + x\\\\\n&= 180 + x.\n\\end{align*} We can then solve for $x$, so the number of people on the beach wearing all three items is $x = \\boxed{10}$."
