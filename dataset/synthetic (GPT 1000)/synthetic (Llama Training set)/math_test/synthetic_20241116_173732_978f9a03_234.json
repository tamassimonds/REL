    "working_out": "First thoughts: Okay, so we need to determine the units digit of \\( 17^{13} - 17 \\). This type of problem seems to draw from my past experience with modular arithmetic, especially focusing on units digits. The units digit of a number is essentially the remainder when divided by 10, so I should consider working in mod 10. Let me think about the pattern in the units digits of powers of 17.\n\n### Step 1: Explore the Problem with Units Digits\n- **Initial step:** Let\u2019s think about \\( 17^n \\) mod 10 because we only care about the units digit.\n- We start by calculating: \n  - \\( 17^1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{10} \\): This gives a units digit of 7.\n  - \\( 17^2 = 289 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{10} \\): So, the units digit is 9.\n  - \\( 17^3 = 4913 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{10} \\): The units digit is 3.\n  - \\( 17^4 = 83521 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10} \\): The units digit ends in 1.\n\n### Step 2: Look for a Cycle\n- **Observation:** There seems to be a pattern emerging from these calculations.\n- **Cycle:** After \\( 17^4 \\), the exponentiation results in units digits starting over from 7. This forms a cycle: 7, 9, 3, 1. Let me verify that by calculating another power:\n  - \\( 17^5 = 1419857 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{10} \\): Indeed, the cycle starts with 7 again.\n- **Cycle Length:** The cycle is every 4 numbers: 7, 9, 3, 1.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Units Digit for \\( 17^{13} \\)\n- **Cycle Use:** Since \\( 17^{13} \\), I need to find the position in the cycle for \\( n = 13 \\).\n- **Cycle Position Calculation:**\n  - \\( 13 \\div 4 \\) gives a remainder of 1 (since 13 can be written as \\( 4 \\times 3 + 1 \\)).\n  - This means that \\( 17^{13} \\) corresponds to the same units digit as \\( 17^1 \\), which is 7.\n  \n### Step 4: Calculate \\( 17^{13} - 17 \\) mod 10\n- **Subtraction in Mod 10:**\n  - The units digit of \\( 17^{13} \\) is 7, as calculated.\n  - The units digit of 17 is also 7.\n  - When I subtract these numbers: \\( 7 - 7 = 0 \\).\n\n### Natural Check-In:\n- **Reflect:** Let me ensure that the steps followed were logical, most notably the cycle length and how it was applied.\n- **Confirmation:** Re-checking calculations shows the consistent correctness in handling modulo operations and cycle logic.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe units digit of \\( 17^{13} - 17 \\) is \\( \\boxed{0} \\).\n\nThis feels right, as I traced different steps systematically and reviewed potential alternate approaches like computing big powers or using patterns for verification without needing to calculate every term. The cycle method effectively simplified the problem to a small computation involving modular arithmetic.",

  "ground_truth": "The units digit of $17^3 - 17$ is the same as the units digit as $7^{13} - 7$.  To find the units digit of $7^{13}$, we look at the first few powers of 7 modulo 10: \\begin{align*}\n7^0 &\\equiv 1, \\\\\n7^1 &\\equiv 7, \\\\\n7^2 &\\equiv 7 \\cdot 7 \\equiv 49 \\equiv 9, \\\\\n7^3 &\\equiv 7 \\cdot 9 \\equiv 63 \\equiv 3, \\\\\n7^4 &\\equiv 7 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 21 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $7^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, the remainders become periodic, with period 4.  Since $13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, $7^{13} \\equiv 7 \\pmod{10}$, so the units digit of $7^{13} - 7$ is $\\boxed{0}$."
