  "problem": "Blake and Jenny each took four 100-point tests.  Blake averaged 78 on the four tests.  Jenny scored 10 points higher than Blake on the first test, 10 points lower than him on the second test, and 20 points higher on both the third and fourth tests. What is the difference between Jenny's average and Blake's average on these four tests?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about Blake and Jenny's test scores. First, let\u2019s break down what we know from the question.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- We need to compare the average scores of Blake and Jenny.\n- Blake's average score over four tests is given directly as 78.\n- Jenny's scores are described in terms of Blake's scores for each test. This means we should find Blake\u2019s scores first and then calculate Jenny\u2019s based on those.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies:\n- **Finding Specific Scores for Blake**: Since we only have an average score for Blake, the first step could be to find possible individual test scores for him.\n- **Calculate Jenny's Scores**: Based on the relationships given (e.g., \"10 points higher\"), we can derive Jenny's scores for each test.\n- **Compare Averages**: Finally, calculate Jenny\u2019s average score and compare it with Blake\u2019s average to find the difference.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n**1. Understanding Relationship Between Scores:**\n   - First Test: Jenny's score = Blake\u2019s score + 10\n   - Second Test: Jenny's score = Blake\u2019s score - 10\n   - Third Test: Jenny's score = Blake\u2019s score + 20\n   - Fourth Test: Jenny's score = Blake\u2019s score + 20\n\n**2. Exploring Blake's Scores:**\n   - Assume Blake\u2019s scores on tests are \\( B_1, B_2, B_3, \\) and \\( B_4 \\).\n   - The average of these is 78, so:  \n     \\[\n     \\frac{B_1 + B_2 + B_3 + B_4}{4} = 78 \\implies B_1 + B_2 + B_3 + B_4 = 312\n     \\]\n\n**3. Now, Calculate Jenny's Scores:**\n   - Using earlier relationships:\n     - \\( J_1 = B_1 + 10 \\)\n     - \\( J_2 = B_2 - 10 \\)\n     - \\( J_3 = B_3 + 20 \\)\n     - \\( J_4 = B_4 + 20 \\)\n   - Therefore, the sum of Jenny\u2019s scores:\n     \\[\n     J_1 + J_2 + J_3 + J_4 = (B_1 + 10) + (B_2 - 10) + (B_3 + 20) + (B_4 + 20)\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying this, we see:\n     \\[\n     = B_1 + B_2 + B_3 + B_4 + 40\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( B_1 + B_2 + B_3 + B_4 = 312 \\), Jenny's total becomes:\n     \\[\n     312 + 40 = 352\n     \\]\n\n**4. Calculate Jenny\u2019s Average:**\n   - Total score of 352 over four tests:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{352}{4} = 88\n     \\]\n\n**5. Compare Averages:**\n   - Blake's average = 78\n   - Jenny\u2019s average = 88\n   - Difference = \\( 88 - 78 = 10 \\)\n\n### Reflection and Verification:\n- This seems correct because we logically followed the relationships between Blake\u2019s and Jenny\u2019s scores.\n- Recheck calculations: we decomposed correctly from the sum of scores to averages.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The difference between Jenny's average score and Blake's average score is 10 points.",

  "ground_truth": "The total point difference between Jenny's and Blake's tests was $10 - 10 + 20 + 20 = 40$ points.  The difference in their averages is $\\frac{40}{4} = \\boxed{10}$ points."
