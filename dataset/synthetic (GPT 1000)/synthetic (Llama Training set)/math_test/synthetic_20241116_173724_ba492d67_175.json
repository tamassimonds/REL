    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step-by-step and really think it through like we're working through it live.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thought**: When I first read the problem, I realize it asks for the reciprocal of the sum of fractions. This immediately reminds me of adding fractions and dealing with reciprocals. It's a common operation, but still needs careful computation because fractions can get tricky if you're not precise.\n\n**Approach**: We need to find the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) first, and then take the reciprocal. This means the final answer will be \\( \\frac{1}{1 \\text{ (the sum)}} \\).\n\n**Step 2: Adding Fractions**\n\n**Initial Thoughts**: A quick brainstorm tells me that adding fractions requires a common denominator. The denominators here are 2, 3, and 4. What\u2019s the smallest number that's a multiple of all these? \n\n**Finding the Least Common Denominator (LCD)**: I realize that I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, and 4.\n- 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12...\n- 3: 3, 6, 9, 12...\n- 4: 4, 8, 12...\n\n**Realization**: 12 is the smallest number that appears in all three lists. So, 12 is our least common denominator.\n\n**Step 3: Converting Fractions**\n\n**Strategy**: To add these fractions, they need to be rewritten with the same denominator (12).\n- \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) as something over 12: Multiply both numerator and denominator by 6 to get \\( \\frac{6}{12} \\).\n- \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) as something over 12: Multiply both numerator and denominator by 4 to get \\( \\frac{4}{12} \\).\n- \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) as something over 12: Multiply both numerator and denominator by 3 to get \\( \\frac{3}{12} \\).\n\n**Step 4: Adding the Fractions**\n\n**Calculation**: Now that the fractions have a common denominator, we can add them.\n\\[ \n\\frac{6}{12} + \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{6 + 4 + 3}{12} = \\frac{13}{12} \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check**: This number, 13/12, seems correct because each fraction converted properly sums beyond 1, as expected given the large numerators and denominator comparison.\n\n**Step 5: Finding the Reciprocal**\n\n**Next thought**: Now that we've got the sum \\( \\frac{13}{12} \\), the problem asks for its reciprocal. The reciprocal of a fraction is simply flipping the numerator and the denominator.\n\n**Calculation**: \n- Reciprocal of \\( \\frac{13}{12} \\) is \\( \\frac{12}{13} \\).\n\n**Step 6: Final Check**\n\n**Reflect**: The reciprocal \\( \\frac{12}{13} \\) makes sense when compared back to our sum. If \\( \\frac{13}{12} \\) seemed a little over 1 (which it does), then its reciprocal should be less than 1, as \\( \\frac{12}{13} \\).\n\nSo, the reciprocal of the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) is \\( \\frac{12}{13} \\).\n\nThis feels like the right path and all steps check out logically!",

  "ground_truth": "We first add a half, a third, and a fourth: $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}$. To do this, we notice that the least common multiple of $2$, $3$, and $4$ is $12$. We can then rewrite each of the three fractions so that they have a denominator of $12$. Since $\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{6}{6} = \\frac{6}{12}$ , $\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{4} = \\frac{4}{12}$ , and $\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{3}{12}$, our sum is: $$\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{6}{12} + \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{6+4+3}{12} = \\frac{13}{12}.$$Taking the reciprocal of this sum, we have that our final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{12}{13}}$."
