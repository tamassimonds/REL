  "problem": "The average American consumes 1483 pounds of candy in a lifetime. Assuming that 1 year $=$ 52 weeks and the average life-span is 75 years, how many pounds of candy per week does the average American consume? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this and really dissect the problem. \n\nFirst Thoughts:\n\n- This seems like a straightforward division problem to find the average weekly candy consumption based on lifetime figures. \n- My initial instinct is to divide the total pounds of candy by the total weeks in a lifetime. \n- But I want to make sure I've got all parts of the problem worked out before jumping to division.\n\nUnderstanding the Problem:\n\n- We know the total candy consumption is 1483 pounds over a lifetime. \n- The average lifespan is given as 75 years, and each year has 52 weeks. \n- Our goal is to find out how much candy is consumed per week on average.\n\nBrainstorm:\n\n- I could multiply 75 years by 52 weeks to get the total number of weeks in a lifetime. \n- Then, divide the total candy consumption by the total number of weeks. \n- This makes sense, right? Making sure each unit (years and weeks) is addressed similarly.\n\nCalculation Steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of weeks in a lifetime:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weeks} = 75 \\text{ years} \\times 52 \\text{ weeks/year} = 3900 \\text{ weeks}\n   \\]\n\n   - Alright, I'm imagining this as a multiplication table in my head, creating rows of 75 years with 52 weeks, kind of like filling out a 2D grid with numbers. \n   - That's a decent number of weeks - let's see if this approach pans out.\n\n2. Determine candy consumption per week:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Candy per week} = \\frac{1483 \\text{ pounds}}{3900 \\text{ weeks}}\n   \\]\n\n   - Now, the division part requires a precise result, so I'm mentally checking if the numbers align.\n   - Performing the calculation with a calculator since 1483 and 3900 aren't exactly numbers I can divide in my head seamlessly.\n\n3. Performing the division:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Candy per week} \\approx 0.38 \\text{ pounds/week (rounded to two decimal places)}\n   \\]\n\n   - Oh! That makes sense. Checking if it's reasonable: 0.38 pounds per week doesn't sound too far-fetched!\n   - Wait... I\u2019m just considering... Is that about the weight of a typical candy bar each week?\n   - Yeah, that definitely seems right\u2014breaking down the numbers for a sanity check helps.\n\nReflection:\n\n- It feels like everything adds up logically now\u2014the steps make sense.\n- I think if I re-evaluate the total candy (1483 pounds) and how it distributes across a lifetime in weeks (3900 weeks), 0.38 pounds each week checks out.\n- This entire exercise reminds me of those \"rate-of-consumption\" problems from math class, where getting the units right was the key.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n- The average American consumes approximately 0.38 pounds of candy per week.\n\nThis meticulous breakdown reassures me that the approach and calculations are correct. That's the solution\u2014this thoughtful, step-by-step strategy definitely ensures understanding.",
