    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Coin $A$ is being tossed three times, and coin $B$ is tossed twice. We want to find the probability that the number of heads from coin $A$ exceeds the number of heads from coin $B$.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- **Reminds me of:** A problem where you compare outcomes of two events, kinda like a typical binomial probability problem.\n- **Unsure about steps to take:** Do I calculate probability for each outcome and compare? Sounds tedious.\n- **Maybe simplify it:** Start with calculating individual probabilities and see where that takes me.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Outcomes\n- **Coin $A$ (3 tosses):** It can result in 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads.\n- **Coin $B$ (2 tosses):** It can result in 0, 1, or 2 heads.\n  \n### Step 2: Probability of Different Outcomes\n- Let's calculate the probabilities of each number of heads using binomial distribution since each coin flip is a Bernoulli trial.\n\n#### Coin $A$ (3 tosses):\n- Probability of getting 0 heads: \\(\\binom{3}{0}(0.5)^0(0.5)^3 = 0.125\\)\n- Probability of getting 1 head: \\(\\binom{3}{1}(0.5)^1(0.5)^2 = 0.375\\)\n- Probability of getting 2 heads: \\(\\binom{3}{2}(0.5)^2(0.5)^1 = 0.375\\)\n- Probability of getting 3 heads: \\(\\binom{3}{3}(0.5)^3(0.5)^0 = 0.125\\)\n\n#### Coin $B$ (2 tosses):\n- Probability of getting 0 heads: \\(\\binom{2}{0}(0.5)^0(0.5)^2 = 0.25\\)\n- Probability of getting 1 head: \\(\\binom{2}{1}(0.5)^1(0.5)^1 = 0.5\\)\n- Probability of getting 2 heads: \\(\\binom{2}{2}(0.5)^2(0.5)^0 = 0.25\\)\n\n### Step 3: Desired Condition \u2013 More Heads from Coin $A$\n- We need more heads on coin $A$ than on coin $B$. So, let's enumerate combinations:\n\n#### Combinations Analysis\n1. **Coin $A$ = 1 head, Coin $B$ = 0 heads**\n   - P(A=1) = 0.375, P(B=0) = 0.25\n   - Combined probability = \\(0.375 \\times 0.25 = 0.09375\\)\n\n2. **Coin $A$ = 2 heads, Coin $B$ = 0 or 1 head**\n   - For B = 0, P(A=2) = 0.375, P(B=0) = 0.25\n   - Combined probability = \\(0.375 \\times 0.25 = 0.09375\\)\n   - For B = 1, P(A=2) = 0.375, P(B=1) = 0.5\n   - Combined probability = \\(0.375 \\times 0.5 = 0.1875\\)\n\n3. **Coin $A$ = 3 heads, Coin $B$ = 0, 1, or 2 heads**\n   - For B = 0, P(A=3) = 0.125, P(B=0) = 0.25\n   - Combined probability = \\(0.125 \\times 0.25 = 0.03125\\)\n   - For B = 1, P(A=3) = 0.125, P(B=1) = 0.5\n   - Combined probability = \\(0.125 \\times 0.5 = 0.0625\\)\n   - For B = 2, P(A=3) = 0.125, P(B=2) = 0.25\n   - Combined probability = \\(0.125 \\times 0.25 = 0.03125\\)\n\n### Step 4: Sum All Valid Probabilities\nAdding all the probabilities where coin $A$ yields more heads than coin $B$:\n- Total probability = \\(0.09375 + 0.09375 + 0.1875 + 0.03125 + 0.0625 + 0.03125 = 0.5\\)\n\n### Reflection:\n- The calculation seemed to check out. I considered all possible ways for coin $A$ to have more heads than coin $B$.\n- Strategy was quite clean once broken down. Enumeration of cases didn\u2019t seem too cumbersome.\n  \n### Conclusion:\nThe probability that more heads are tossed using coin $A$ than using coin $B$ is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "More generally, suppose coin $A$ is tossed $n + 1$ times and coin $B$ is tossed $n$ times.\n\nConsider the situation when coin $A$ has been tossed $n$ times and coin $B$ has been tossed $n$ times.  At this point, in terms of heads, either $A$ is ahead of $B,$ $B$ is ahead of $A,$ or they are tied.  Let $p$ be the probability that $A$ is ahead of $B.$  Then by symmetry, $p$ is the probability that $B$ is ahead of $A,$ so the probability of a tie is $1 - 2p.$\n\nNow coin $A$ is tossed one more time.  If coin $A$ ends up with more heads, then either it was ahead before the last flip (which occurs with probability $p$), or it was tied before the last flip and got heads for the last flip (which occurs with probability $(1 - 2p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$).  Therefore, the probability that coins $A$ ends up with more heads is\n\\[p + (1 - 2p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\]"
