    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem. Our goal is to find the value of \\(2 * 6\\) given the defined operation \\(a * b = a^b + b^a\\). Let's break it down step by step. \n\n**First Thoughts and Initial Impression:**\n\n- Hmm, the operation \\(a * b = a^b + b^a\\) isn't a standard arithmetic operation. It's a custom operation defined specifically for this problem.\n- Right off the bat, I need to compute both \\(a^b\\) and \\(b^a\\). This seems like a job for direct computation for relatively small numbers like 2 and 6.\n- My first objective is to just plug in the numbers, but let's ensure I understand the definition first.\n\n**Step 1: Setting Up the Problem**\n\n- I'm given the numbers \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 6\\).\n- According to the operation, \\((2 * 6)\\) will be calculated as \\(2^6 + 6^2\\).\n\n**Step 2: Compute Individual Powers**\n\n- Let's start with calculating \\(2^6\\). I remember that:\n  - \\(2^1 = 2\\)\n  - \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n  - \\(2^3 = 8\\) (really just \\(2^2 \\times 2\\))\n  - \\(2^4 = 16\\) (which is \\(8 \\times 2\\))\n  - \\(2^5 = 32\\) (\\(16 \\times 2\\))\n  - \\(2^6 = 64\\) (\\(32 \\times 2\\))\n- Now for \\(6^2\\):\n  - \\(6^2 = 36\\) (since \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\))\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Result of the Operation**\n\n- With those computations done, I need to add these two results together: \\(2^6 + 6^2 = 64 + 36\\).\n- When I add these values, I get:\n  - \\(64 + 36 = 100\\)\n\n**Checking the Calculation:**\n\n- Quick sanity check: Does this addition seem correct? Yes, the arithmetic checks out.\n- I applied the operation only after computing both \\(2^6\\) and \\(6^2\\), and the addition seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Thoughts and Conclusion:**\n\n- Everything feels right. I've applied the operation step by step, verifying each part along the way.\n- The calculated value of \\(2 * 6\\) is indeed \\(100\\), based on the given operation definition.\n- This exercise reminds me that often simple arithmetic operations or newly defined operations require careful step-by-step verification.\n\nIn summary, the value of \\(2 * 6\\) is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
