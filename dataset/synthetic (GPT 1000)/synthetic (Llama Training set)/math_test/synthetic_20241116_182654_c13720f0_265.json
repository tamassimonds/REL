    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem! We're dealing with complex numbers here, and our task is to find the sum of two complex numbers that represent certain values of popularity. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst off, let's look at the numbers given:\n\n- Kelly's number: \\(508 + 1749i\\)\n- Avril's number: \\(-1322 + 1949i\\)\n\nWhat we want is the sum of these two numbers. My initial thought is this should be straightforward because adding complex numbers is like adding two binomials where one of the terms involves the imaginary unit \\(i\\). We can simply add the real parts together and add the imaginary parts together.\n\n### Exploring the Strategy\nLet me note down what different parts of the numbers represent:\n\n1. **Real Part**: For Kelly it\u2019s 508, and for Avril, it\u2019s -1322.\n2. **Imaginary Part**: For Kelly it\u2019s 1749i and for Avril, it\u2019s 1949i.\n\nSo the overall task is to sum these parts respectively. I don't foresee any need for other strategies like multiplying or dealing with magnitudes/phases of complex numbers because we're purely adding them.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\nLet's start by adding these parts together:\n\n- **Real Parts Sum**: \\(508 + (-1322)\\)\n  - Hmm, let's actually compute that: \n    - \\(508\\) and I subtract \\(1322\\) (because it's negative, essentially).\n    - That becomes \\(508 - 1322 = -814\\).\n  \n  - Wait a moment, let\u2019s double-check. Yep, that seems right as I subtract 1322 from 508, results in negative because 1322 is greater than 508.\n\n- **Imaginary Parts Sum**: \\(1749i + 1949i\\)\n  - This should be simple integer addition, so \\(1749 + 1949 = 3698\\).\n  - So, the imaginary part sums up to \\(3698i\\).\n\n### Constructing the Result\nPutting these together, the sum of Kelly\u2019s and Avril\u2019s numbers represented in complex form is:\n\n- **Final Sum**: \\(-814 + 3698i\\)\n\n### Double-Checking Our Work\nBefore I confirm the answer, let\u2019s quickly run a check:\n\n1. Real part was \\(-814\\), verifying back through subtraction, this holds.\n2. Imaginary combined to \\(3698i\\), and rechecking the sum across \\(1749 + 1949\\) keeps it at 3698.\n\nEverything looks consistent! The approach appears sound, logical, and thorough. I don't see any way this could have gone wrong given the straightforward nature of adding complex numbers directly. If it were anything involving angles or multiplication, then revisiting would be crucial.\n\nSo, the sum of their complex numbers, representing the popularity, is:\n\n\\(-814 + 3698i\\)",
