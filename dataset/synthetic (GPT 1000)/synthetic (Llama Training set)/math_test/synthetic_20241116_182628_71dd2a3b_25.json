    "working_out": "### Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, I need to convert the point \\((-4, 0)\\) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. This feels a bit like when I worked on transformations between coordinate systems in the past. Polar coordinates are expressed as \\((r, \\theta)\\), where \\(r\\) is the distance from the origin and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle from the positive x-axis. I remember theta being the tricky part sometimes because angles can have multiple valid representations depending on the constraints given.\n\n### Brainstorming the Approach\n\n1. **Calculate the Radius \\(r\\):** I remember that in polar coordinates, the radius \\(r\\) is calculated using the formula \\(r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\). Seems straightforward here, but I'll need to think about positives and negatives carefully.\n\n2. **Determine the Angle \\(\\theta\\):** For \\(\\theta\\), I think I need to use trigonometric functions. However, there's a catch since it's not straightforward due to the point being on the negative x-axis. Knowing how polar coordinates work, I feel like this is where angles can get tricky.\n\n3. **Ensure Conditions Satisfied:** I need to make sure that the angle \\(\\theta\\) is such that \\(0 \\leq \\theta < 2\\pi\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate the Radius \\(r\\)\n\n- The formula is \\(r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\).\n- Given \\(x = -4\\) and \\(y = 0\\), I plug these into the formula.\n  \n  \\[\n  r = \\sqrt{(-4)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{16} = 4\n  \\]\n\n- It's clear that \\(r = 4\\). This feels right so far since the distance from the origin to the point (-4, 0) should indeed be 4 units.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the Angle \\(\\theta\\)\n\n- Since the point \\((-4, 0)\\) lies on the negative x-axis, intuitively, the angle from the positive x-axis should be \\(\\pi\\) (or \\(180^\\circ\\)).\n\n- However, let me confirm this:\n\n  - If \\(\\theta\\) is generally found using \\(\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)\\), we're actually looking at special cases here since \\(y = 0\\). Typically, angles for points on axes are directly derivable without trigonometric functions.\n\n  - For points on the positive x-axis, \\(\\theta = 0\\), while on the negative x-axis (like here), \\(\\theta = \\pi\\).\n\n- So, directly: \\(\\theta = \\pi\\).\n\n- Checking it quickly in my mind, this seems sensible: moving left along the x-axis from the positive side indeed forms a \\(\\pi\\) radian angle with the positive x-axis.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify Conditions\n\n- I need to check: \\(0 \\leq \\theta < 2\\pi\\).\n- \\(\\theta = \\pi\\) is definitely within this range.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe polar coordinates are \\((r, \\theta) = (4, \\pi)\\).\n\n### Final Reflection\n\nThis method seems to have worked well, with calculations matching what I expect given the position of the point on the Cartesian plane. It didn't involve any complex math beyond understanding the geometry. This matches my intuition and previous knowledge about how points on the axes translate to polar form. All conditions have been checked and adhered, confirming that the polar coordinates \\((4, \\pi)\\) are correct.",
