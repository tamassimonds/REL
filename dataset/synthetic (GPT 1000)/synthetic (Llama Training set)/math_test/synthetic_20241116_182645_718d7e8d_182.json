    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. It's crucial to explore different approaches and check our work throughout. I'll start by jotting down some initial thoughts.\n\n### First Thoughts:\n- We have two equations from the problem statement:\n  1. \\( 2d = 17e - 8 \\)\n  2. \\( 2e = d - 9 \\)\n\n- When I first saw these equations, it reminded me of solving systems of equations. We usually solve these by substitution or elimination. But let's think about options here.\n\n### Exploring Strategies:\n1. **Substitution Method**: \n   - We could solve one of the equations for one variable and then substitute it into the other.\n   - Let me try this approach first because substitution seems straightforward given the expressions.\n\n2. **Elimination Method**: \n   - We could try to eliminate one variable by combining the equations, but I think substitution might be easier because solving for \\(d\\) or \\(e\\) seems direct here.\n\n3. **Graphical Interpretation or Other Methods**:\n   - I don't think a graphical approach will expose anything more insightful for this specific problem because of its linear nature.\n\n### Proceed with Substitution:\n- Start with the second equation \\(2e = d - 9\\).\n- Solve this for \\(d\\): \n  \\[\n  d = 2e + 9\n  \\]\n\n- Now, substitute \\(d = 2e + 9\\) into the first equation:\n  \\[\n  2(2e + 9) = 17e - 8\n  \\]\n\n### Simplify and Solve:\n- Distribute the 2 on the left side:\n  \\[\n  4e + 18 = 17e - 8\n  \\]\n\n- We need to isolate and solve for \\(e\\). First, I\u2019ll subtract \\(4e\\) from both sides:\n  \\[\n  18 = 13e - 8\n  \\]\n\n- Next, add 8 to both sides:\n  \\[\n  26 = 13e\n  \\]\n\n- Divide by 13 to solve for \\(e\\):\n  \\[\n  e = 2\n  \\]\n\n### Verification:\n- Now, let\u2019s double-check this solution by substituting \\(e = 2\\) back into the original context.\n- From \\(d = 2e + 9\\), if \\(e = 2\\):\n  \\[\n  d = 2(2) + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13\n  \\]\n\n- Check the original equations:\n  1. For \\(2d = 17e - 8\\):\n     \\[\n     2(13) = 17(2) - 8 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 26 = 34 - 8 = 26 \\quad \\text{(Right!)}\n     \\]\n  2. For \\(2e = d - 9\\):\n     \\[\n     2(2) = 13 - 9 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4 = 4 \\quad \\text{(Right!)}\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The solution \\(e = 2\\) works for both equations, confirming correctness.\n- Reflecting on this approach, the substitution method worked effectively since we could straightforwardly solve for one variable and substitute back.\n- Always handy to check work to reinforce that we've truly found the correct solution. \n\nDone! This step-by-step approach led us to a consistent solution.",
