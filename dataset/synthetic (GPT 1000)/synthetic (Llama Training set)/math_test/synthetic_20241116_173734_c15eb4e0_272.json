    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. This is a geometry problem that involves both understanding the physical setup and doing some calculations. I'm going to write this as if I'm thinking through it myself.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\n\nFirst, I want to make sure I understand what\u2019s being asked. The problem involves three golf balls stacked vertically in a box that is 13.5 cm tall. The balls touch each other and the ends of the box. We need to find the circumference of one ball, given as a fraction with \\(\\pi\\).\n\nStraight away, I picture the golf balls in the box. Since they're spheres, when stacked, they touch at their poles. This suggests that the diameter of a ball equals three things: the height of the box divided by 3. I'd say: \"Oh! This looks like a direct translation into diameters.\"\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the diameter of one ball\n\nSince there are three balls stacked vertically and they just fit perfectly, I\u2019ll divide the total height by three to find the diameter of one golf ball:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Diameter of one ball} = \\frac{13.5 \\, \\text{cm}}{3} = 4.5 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nDoes this approach make sense? Yes, because each ball's top touches the bottom of the ball above and the bottom of the ball below (except for the topmost and bottommost), dividing the height equally.\n\n### Step 3: Understanding circumference\n\nNow, I remember that the circumference of a circle (or great circle of the sphere) is given by the equation \\( C = \\pi \\times d \\), where \\( d \\) is the diameter.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the circumference of the golf ball\n\nSubstitute the diameter from above into the circumference formula:\n\n\\[\nC = \\pi \\times 4.5\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nC = 4.5\\pi\n\\]\n\n### Reflection and Verification\n\nJust to double-check: \n- Dividing 13.5 cm by 3 to get the diameter makes sense because we're essentially stacking three diameters on top of each other to fill the vertical space.\n- The circumference formula used is standard for any circle, so applying it here is appropriate since we just needed the great circle measurement.\n\nFrom these checks, everything appears to line up correctly.\n\nSo the circumference of each golf ball, expressed as a common fraction in terms of \\(\\pi\\), is:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{2}\\pi\n\\]\n\nI'll write it in this simplified fractional form for consistency with the problem's requirements. Hence, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}\\pi}\n\\]\n\nI feel confident this is correct now. This was straightforward after visualizing how the stacking works with spheres in a confined space.",
