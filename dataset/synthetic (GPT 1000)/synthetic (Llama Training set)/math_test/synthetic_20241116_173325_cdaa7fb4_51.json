    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this!\n\n**First thoughts:**\n\nThe problem asks to express the quadratic \\( x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6 \\) in the form \\( (x + b)^2 + c \\). This structure is reminiscent of completing the square, a technique often used to rewrite quadratic expressions. I remember from past experience that it's about reshaping the expression by creating a perfect square trinomial, which involves adjusting and balancing terms. That info signals that there's a bit of algebraic manipulation involved.\n\nMy immediate sense is that we can transform the given quadratic into this desired form by identifying that this structure involves a perfect square plus or minus a constant adjustment.\n\n**Brainstorming ways to solve:**\n\nThe general idea is to complete the square, but how do we specifically do it here?\n\n1. **Try completing the square:**\n   - First, let\u2019s recall the procedure: For a quadratic \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we often take half of \\( b \\), square it, and use that to build our square.\n   - Here, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 2.6 \\), so take half of \\( 2.6 \\), which is \\( 1.3 \\), and then square it to get \\( 1.3^2 \\).\n\n2. **Construct the squared term:**\n   - Form \\( (x + 1.3)^2 = x^2 + 2 \\times 1.3 \\cdot x + 1.3^2 = x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69 \\).\n\n   Oh! That\u2019s exciting because \\( x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69 \\) looks like a part of something that fits the bill.\n\n3. **Compare this back to the original quadratic:**\n   - We have \\( x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6 \\). The difference between \\( 3.6 \\) and \\( 1.69 \\), what we constructed is:\n   \\[ 3.6 - 1.69 = 1.91. \\]\n\nTherefore, we rewrite the original quadratic by completing the square as:\n\\[ x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6 = (x + 1.3)^2 + 1.91. \\]\n\n**Checking the work:**\n\nQuick sense check: Expanding \\( (x + 1.3)^2 + 1.91 \\) should get us \\( x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6 \\).\n- Expanding \\( (x + 1.3)^2 \\) gives: \\( x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69 \\).\n- Adding the \\( 1.91 \\) to \\( 1.69 \\) reproduces the \\( +3.6 \\) from the original quadratic, so it checks out! Yay!\n\n**Calculate \\( b+c \\):**\n\nWe identified \\( b = 1.3 \\) and \\( c = 1.91 \\). Therefore,\n\\[ b + c = 1.3 + 1.91 = 3.21. \\]\n\n**Final reflection:**\n\nThis process looks pretty good and straightforward. Each step worked smoothly, and the check confirmed our transformation was correct. The result \\( b + c = 3.21 \\) should indeed be the correct answer to this problem.",

  "ground_truth": "We complete the square.\n\nWe have $(x+1.3)^2 = x^2 + (2.6)x + 1.69$, and so\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+(2.6)x+3.6 &= (x+1.3)^2 - 1.69 + 3.6 \\\\\n&= (x+1.3)^2 + 1.91.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $b=1.3$ and $c=1.91$, which gives us $b+c = \\boxed{3.21}$."
