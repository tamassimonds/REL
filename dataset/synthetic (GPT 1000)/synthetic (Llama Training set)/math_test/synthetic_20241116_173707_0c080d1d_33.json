    "working_out": "Sure, let's dig into this problem together, step-by-step, and really think it through in a human-like, exploratory way. \n\n### Step 1: Initial Understanding\n\nOkay, let's take a look at this problem. We have a new technology that costs upfront money and some maintenance each year. But it saves money too. The key here seems to be calculating how long it takes for the savings to offset the costs. \n\nHmm, it looks like we have two types of costs: the initial installation cost and the recurring annual maintenance cost. Then there's the savings, which are annual. We'll probably need to find when the savings from the technology equal the costs of installing and maintaining it. This feels a bit like a break-even problem.\n\n### Step 2: Explore Strategies\n\n1. **Simple Linear Analysis:** The problem could be about calculating the point where savings exceed costs. That\u2019s like solving for a break-even year.\n\n2. **Cumulative Cost vs. Savings Approach:** Maybe it helps to think about the cumulative cost and cumulative savings each year until savings surpass costs.\n\n3. **Algebraically:** Setting up an equation to solve for the year where net savings start.\n\nIt seems I\u2019ll have to combine a couple approaches: breaking it down year by year and possibly setting up an algebraic equation.\n\n### Step 3: Algebraic Setup\n\nLet's try setting up an equation. Suppose we let \\( x \\) denote the number of years it takes to recuperate the investment:\n\n- **Total Cost \\( C \\):** Installation cost \\( + \\) Total maintenance costs over \\( x \\) years\n  \\[\n  C = 10,000 + 650x\n  \\]\n\n- **Total Savings \\( S \\):** \\( 1200 \\times x \\) over \\( x \\) years\n  \\[\n  S = 1200x\n  \\]\n\n**Break-even Point:** When savings equal costs:\n\\[\n1200x = 10,000 + 650x\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\( x \\)\n\nOkay, let\u2019s solve the equation:\n\\[\n1200x = 10,000 + 650x\n\\]\nSubtract \\( 650x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n550x = 10,000\n\\]\nDivide both sides by 550:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{10,000}{550} \n\\]\n\nHmm, I need to calculate that. Let's see:\n\\[\nx \\approx 18.18\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Reflection and Checks\n\nOh, since we're looking for whole years, \\( x \\) should be at least 19 years because 18.18 years means costs are still slightly ahead of savings at 18 years.\n\nLet me double-check:\n- After 18 years: \n  - Savings: \\( 1200 \\times 18 = 21,600 \\)\n  - Costs: \\( 10,000 + 650 \\times 18 = 21,700 \\)\n\n- After 19 years:\n  - Savings: \\( 1200 \\times 19 = 22,800 \\)\n  - Costs: \\( 10,000 + 650 \\times 19 = 22,350 \\)\n\nYes, at 19 years, savings surpass costs. Okay, that confirms it.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nIt will take 19 whole years for the technology to recuperate its costs. This seems correct based on the calculations and checks we've done. \n\nHmm, this seems reasonable since we've accounted for both installation and maintenance costs properly, and our logical checks align with this result.",

  "ground_truth": "We look for the least number of years $n$ it takes for the savings to be greater than or equal to the costs. \\begin{align*}\n1200n&\\ge10,000+650n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n550n&\\ge10,000\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nn&\\ge\\frac{10,000}{550}=18.\\overline{18}\n\\end{align*}The smallest integer greater than $18.\\overline{18}$ is 19, so it will take $\\boxed{19}$ years to recuperate the costs."
