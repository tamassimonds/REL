    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The operation \\( a \\star b = \\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{1}{b} - \\dfrac{1}{a}\\right)}{(a - b)} \\) is given, and we want to find \\( 3 \\star 11 \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- Hmm, okay. This looks like some sort of special operation involving fractions.\n- The structure reminds me of the difference of two reciprocals, and then that difference is adjusted by dividing by the difference of the original numbers. Interesting.\n- Part of me is worried about the operation because it involves division, which might mean a lot of simplifying.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n1. Let's start by rewriting the expression given our specific values, \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( b = 11 \\).\n   \\[ 3 \\star 11 = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{11} - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)}{(3 - 11)} \\]\n\n2. Evaluating \\( \\frac{1}{11} - \\frac{1}{3} \\):\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{11}\\) is clear enough, but what's \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) look like once we get a common denominator? \n   - Oh wait, yes! Common denominator time. 33 should work since it's the LCM of 11 and 3.\n   - So, \\(\\frac{1}{11} = \\frac{3}{33}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{11}{33}\\).\n   - The subtraction becomes: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{33} - \\frac{11}{33} = \\frac{3 - 11}{33} = \\frac{-8}{33}\n     \\]\n\n**Reflections and Checks So Far:**\n- Yes, that part seems right. But it's negative, which might be important since I still need to divide by another negative.\n- Let's keep moving and check if it cancels out.\n\n3. Now, think about the denominator part \\( 3 - 11 \\):\n   - Quick arithmetic: \\( 3 - 11 = -8 \\).\n\n4. Substitute back into the expression:\n   - We have: \n     \\[\n     3 \\star 11 = \\frac{\\frac{-8}{33}}{-8}\n     \\]\n\n5. Division simplification:\n   - Hmm, dividing a fraction by an integer. This reminds me of simply multiplying by the reciprocal.\n   - So: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{-8}{33} \\div -8 = \\frac{-8}{33} \\times \\frac{-1}{8} = \\frac{-8 \\times -1}{33 \\times 8}\n   \\]\n\n6. Simplify the multiplication:\n   - The \\(8\\) in the numerator and denominator cancel each other.\n   - That simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{33}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Okay, everything looks neat and tidy.\n- All arithmetic matches; no funny business with the negatives now that everything checks out.\n- I found \\( 3 \\star 11 = \\frac{1}{33} \\).\n\nThat's it! \\( 3 \\star 11 \\) is clearly \\(\\frac{1}{33}\\). I\u2019m content with this solution because all the steps fit together logically, and the math checks out.",

  "ground_truth": "We could plug in 3 and 11 to find the answer. However, note that $a \\star b = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{a - b}{ab}}{a - b} = \\dfrac{1}{ab}$. Therefore, $3 \\star 11 = \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 11} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{33}}$."
