    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'm looking at a quadratic polynomial \\( p(x) \\) with rational coefficients. The pieces of information given are:\n\n- \\( p(\\sqrt{7}) = 22 \\)\n- \\( p(\\sqrt{11}) = 30 \\)\n\nThe ultimate goal is to find \\( p(\\sqrt{17}) \\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nThe constraints indicate that \\( \\sqrt{7} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{11} \\) aren't typical values for polynomials, so it's unlikely they can both be roots of a simple polynomial with rational coefficients unless structured specifically around these values. The rational coefficients suggest they balance somehow to yield rational outcomes. This feels similar to problems involving symmetric polynomials or using conjugates, but these aren\u2019t conjugates.\n\n### Strategy Brainstorm\n\n1. **Quadratic Assumption:**\n   Since \\( p(x) \\) is quadratic, let\u2019s assume a form like \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\) with \\( a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\). \n\n2. **Linear Dependence and Elimination:**\n   Consider using the given \\( p(x) \\) evaluations to establish a system of equations in terms of \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n3. **Other insights:**\n   A reflection might suggest leveraging the fact that these can bear resemblance to solving simultaneous equations involving radicals.\n\n### Step-by-step Construction\n\n1. **Assume a General Form:**\n   Let \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\n2. **Substitute Known Values:**\n   Substituting \\( \\sqrt{7} \\) and \\( \\sqrt{11} \\) in the polynomial:\n\n   \\[\n   p(\\sqrt{7}) = a(\\sqrt{7})^2 + b(\\sqrt{7}) + c = a \\cdot 7 + b \\sqrt{7} + c = 22 \n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   p(\\sqrt{11}) = a(\\sqrt{11})^2 + b(\\sqrt{11}) + c = a \\cdot 11 + b \\sqrt{11} + c = 30 \n   \\]\n\n3. **Express Rational Components:**\n   Separate rational and irrational parts:\n\n   - For \\( \\sqrt{7} \\): \\( 7a + c = 22 - b \\sqrt{7} \\)\n   - For \\( \\sqrt{11} \\): \\( 11a + c = 30 - b \\sqrt{11} \\)\n\n4. **Evaluate Conditions for Rational Coefficients:**\n   Since \\( b \\sqrt{7} \\) and \\( b \\sqrt{11} \\) should separately reconcile their irrational contributions, set:\n\n   \\( b = 0 \\), simplifying the above:\n\n   \\[\n   7a + c = 22\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   11a + c = 30 \n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve The Equations:**\n   Subtract these equations to eliminate \\( c \\):\n   \n   \\[\n   11a + c - (7a + c) = 30 - 22 \\implies 4a = 8 \\implies a = 2\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate \\( c \\):**\n   Substitute the found \\( a \\):\n\n   \\[\n   7(2) + c = 22 \\implies 14 + c = 22 \\implies c = 8\n   \\]\n\n7. **Find \\( p(\\sqrt{17}) \\):**\n   Now, substituting into the polynomial \\( p(x) = 2x^2 + 8 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   p(\\sqrt{17}) = 2(\\sqrt{17})^2 + 8 = 2 \\cdot 17 + 8 = 34 + 8 = 42\n   \\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nI feel quite confident in these steps. The structured approach validates\u2014logical systematic solving of polynomial equations, given conditions, inspection for rational outcomes, and solid algebra basics.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\np(\\sqrt{17}) = 42\n\\]",
