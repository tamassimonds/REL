    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this step-by-step problem-solving process. As I read the problem, it's about finding the wavelength of a photon with significantly more energy than a photon of red light. \n\nFirst thoughts: \n- I know from the problem that the wavelength of red light is approximately \\(7 \\times 10^{-7}\\) meters.\n- I'm told that energy and wavelength are inversely proportional, which instantly makes me think of the formula \\(E \\propto \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\), or more specifically, \\(E = \\frac{h \\cdot c}{\\lambda}\\), where \\(E\\) is energy, \\(h\\) is Planck's constant, \\(c\\) is the speed of light, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength.\n- A photon with 2000 times the energy means it should have a wavelength that is 1/2000 of the red light photon's wavelength because of that inverse relationship.\n\nStrategy brainstorming: \n- Compute the new wavelength by dividing the original wavelength by 2000.\n- Check if the wavelength calculation fits nicely into the scientific notation form with \\(1 \\leq a < 10\\).\n\nCalculating:\n1. Let's calculate the new wavelength: \n   \\[\n   \\lambda_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{7 \\times 10^{-7}}{2000}\n   \\]\n   This will give:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{7}{2000} \\times 10^{-7} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-10}\n   \\]\n\n2. Let's check the scientific notation condition:\n   - Here, \\(a = 3.5\\) and \\(b = -10\\). This fits the requirement that \\(1 \\le a < 10\\).\n\nNow let's ensure the reasoning and computations are on point:\n- I used the inverse relationship correctly, dividing wavelength by 2000 to find the wavelength of a photon with 2000 times the energy.\n- Scientific notation looks good with \\(a = 3.5\\) and \\(b = -10\\).\n\nOh, and to calculate the final part:\n- \\(a + b = 3.5 - 10 = -6.5\\).\n\nDeeper reflection:\n- This makes intuitive sense, as higher energy means a shorter wavelength and thus a smaller result after dividing.\n- Everything seems to fit with the properties and relationships of photons and wavelengths.\n\nFinal answer: \nThe value \\(a + b\\) is \\(-6.5\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Let the energy of a photon equal $E$ and the wavelength equal $\\lambda$.  Since the wavelength is inversely proportional to the energy, the product $E\\lambda$ must be equal to some constant, say $k$.  Given photons of red light with a wavelength of $7\\times10^{-7}$, we can write: \\begin{align*}\nE(7\\times10^{-7})&=k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 7\\times10^{-7}&=\\frac{k}{E}\n\\end{align*} Now, we are asked to find the wavelength of a photon with 2000 times the energy of red light.  Substitute $2000E$ for $E$ in the original expression: \\begin{align*}\n(2000E)\\lambda&=k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\lambda&=\\frac{k}{2000E}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2000}\\cdot\\frac{k}{E}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{2\\times10^3}\\cdot7\\times10^{-7}\\\\\n&={3.5\\times10^{-10} \\text{ meters}}\n\\end{align*} Therefore, we have $a+b = \\boxed{-6.5}$."
