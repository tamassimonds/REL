    "working_out": "First thoughts are important:\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, I immediately see that it involves the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM). I remember from mathematics that there's a relationship between the GCD and LCM of two numbers: for any two positive integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the product of the GCD and LCM is equal to the product of the numbers themselves, i.e., \\(\\gcd(a, b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a, b] = a \\cdot b\\).\n\nThis reminds me to relate this to the current problem where \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 2\\) and \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m, n] = 108\\). From this, I can derive that \\(m \\cdot n = 2 \\times 108\\).\n\nReflecting on this: If \\(m \\cdot n = 216\\), both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) must be multiples of 2 as \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 2\\).\n\nHmm, let\u2019s break this down:\n\n1. Since \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 2\\), both numbers must be multiples of 2, so we can write \\(m = 2a\\) and \\(n = 2b\\), where \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 1\\).\n2. Substituting in the equation of the product, \\( (2a) \\cdot (2b) = 216 \\), which simplifies to \\( 4ab = 216 \\).\n\nWait, let's solve for \\(ab\\):\n\n3. Dividing through by 4 gives \\( ab = \\frac{216}{4} = 54 \\). So now we need to find numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that their product is 54 and they are coprime (i.e., \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 1\\)).\n\nGreat, let's list down all pairs of factors of 54:\n- The pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(a \\cdot b = 54\\) are:\n  \\((1, 54), (2, 27), (3, 18), (6, 9), (9, 6), (18, 3), (27, 2), (54, 1)\\).\n\nChecking these pairs for gcd = 1:\n\n- \\((1, 54)\\): \\(\\gcd(1, 54) = 1\\) (Works!)\n- \\((2, 27)\\): \\(\\gcd(2, 27) = 1\\) (Works!)\n- \\((3, 18)\\): \\(\\gcd(3, 18) = 3\\) (Doesn't work.)\n- \\((6, 9)\\): \\(\\gcd(6, 9) = 3\\) (Doesn't work.)\n- \\((9, 6)\\): \\(\\gcd(9, 6) = 3\\) (Duplicate from \\((6, 9)\\), doesn't qualify.)\n- \\((18, 3)\\): \\(\\gcd(18, 3) = 3\\) (Doesn't work.)\n- \\((27, 2)\\): \\(\\gcd(27, 2) = 1\\) (Works as reverse of (2, 27))\n- \\((54, 1)\\): \\(\\gcd(54, 1) = 1\\) (Works as reverse of (1, 54))\n\nAha! We found the coprime pairs: \\((1, 54), (2, 27), (27, 2), (54, 1)\\).\n\nNow, considering symmetry if \\(m = 2a\\) and \\(n = 2b\\), or vice versa:\n\n- \\(m, n = (2 \\times 1, 2 \\times 54) = (2, 108)\\) and \\((108, 2)\\)\n- \\(m, n = (2 \\times 2, 2 \\times 27) = (4, 54)\\) and \\((54, 4)\\)\n- \\(m, n = (2 \\times 27, 2 \\times 2) = (54, 4)\\) and \\((4, 54)\\), which are duplicates.\n- \\(m, n = (2 \\times 54, 2 \\times 1) = (108, 2)\\) and \\((2, 108)\\), which are duplicates.\n\nFinally, considering distinct pairs:\n\nCounting distinct ordered pairs gives us four pairs: \n\\((2, 108)\\), \\((108, 2)\\), \\((4, 54)\\), and \\((54, 4)\\).\n\nThe answer is therefore \\(4\\) ordered pairs. \n\nReflecting: This seems correct based on the coprimality and the right configurations.

  "ground_truth": "Since $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = 108 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^3$, we know $m = 2^a \\cdot 3^b$ and $n = 2^c \\cdot 3^d$ for some positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.  Furthermore, $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[2^a \\cdot 3^b, 2^c \\cdot 3^d] = 2^{\\max\\{a,c\\}} \\cdot 3^{\\max\\{b,d\\}}$, so $\\max\\{a,c\\} = 2$ and $\\max\\{b,d\\} = 3$.\n\nAlso, $\\gcd(m,n) = 2$, but $\\gcd(m,n) = \\gcd(2^a \\cdot 3^b, 2^c \\cdot 3^d) = 2^{\\min\\{a,c\\}} \\cdot 3^{\\min\\{b,d\\}}$, so $\\min\\{a,c\\} = 1$ and $\\min\\{b,d\\} = 0$.\n\nThere are only 2 pairs $(a,c)$ that satisfy $\\min\\{a,c\\} = 1$ and $\\max\\{a,c\\} = 2$, namely $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$.  There are only 2 pairs $(b,d)$ that satisfy $\\min\\{b,d\\} = 0$ and $\\max\\{b,d\\} = 3$, namely $(0,3)$ and $(3,0)$.  Therefore, there are $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ possible quadruples $(a,b,c,d)$, so there are $\\boxed{4}$ possible pairs $(m,n)$."
