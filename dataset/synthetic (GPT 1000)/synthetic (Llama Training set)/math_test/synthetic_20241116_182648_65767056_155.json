    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together. I'll start by jotting down my initial thoughts and possible approaches.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe have two equations involving real numbers \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(p\\):\n\n1. \\((m+n+p)(mn+mp+np) = 25\\)\n2. \\(m^2(n+p) + n^2(m+p) + p^2(m+n) = 4\\)\n\nWe are asked to find the value of \\(mnp\\).\n\nAt first glance, these equations remind me of identities and symmetric sums in algebra, potentially involving the expansion of products. Let\u2019s think about how we might utilize these relations to find \\(mnp\\).\n\n### Brainstorming Approaches\n1. **System of Equations**: Try to express one variable in terms of others across these equations. Seems challenging due to non-linearity.\n2. **Symmetry and Polynomial**: These equations might hint at some polynomial symmetry. We could theoretically think in terms of roots of polynomial equations, where \\(m, n, p\\) are roots.\n3. **Straightforward Manipulation and Substitution**: Check if there\u2019s a straightforward manipulation or substitution that might simplify things.\n\n### Polynomials and Symmetric Sums Approach\nOh! The first equation \\((m+n+p)(mn+mp+np)\\) reminds me of the expansion strategies for polynomials, maybe Vieta\u2019s formulas or product-sum identities, but it\u2019s not quite those typically used.\n\nLet's relook at the equations:\n- The first one seems to involve basic symmetric sums of roots.\n- The second one looks more like a rearrangement or incorporation of these sum products.\n\n### Insight and Checking Simplifications\n- The equation \\((m+n+p)(mn+mp+np)\\) is expanding into an expression composed of simpler symmetric polynomials \\(m, n, p\\).\n- For the second equation, the structure \\(m^2(n+p) + n^2(m+p) + p^2(m+n)\\) looks like an exploitation of squares with respect to \\(m, n, p\\), potentially arranged or manipulated via factorization.\n\nHmm, what if I consider redundancy or hidden identities here? \n\n### Mechanical Insight Check\nLet\u2019s test if it fits looking at any symmetrical simplification or if variables are canceling each other's impacts.\n\nIf I assume \\(m = n = p\\), for simplicity:\n- The first equation becomes \\(3m^2(3m^2) = 25\\) leading to \\(9m^4 = 25\\).\n- Thus, \\(m^2 = \\frac{25}{9}\\) or \\(m = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{25}{9}}\\).\n\nThis result doesn\u2019t directly help me with the second equation, pushing me to realize the simplicity hidden could not be as calculative.\n\n### Back Up and Simplify Further\nAggregated insights didn't immediately show a feasible path. Let's look at individual terms, try simple theoretical assumptions:\n- Maybe zero for specific cases?\n\nChecking case: **One variable zero**\n- If \\(p = 0\\), then from the second equation, we attempt to fit solutions into such axises.\n  \nRechecking what wasn\u2019t explored correctly.\nContinuing with tests across \\(m, n, p\\) with partial zero-increments and symmetric case handling might yield further restrictions.\n\n### Evaluation and Final Checks\nLet me revisit polynomial symmetry, shark back into polynomial roots, assume simple forms with plausible zeroes. \n\nUltimately, I suspect this must compile from simplified indirect handles within symmetry and hidden or interior passive composite combinations.\n\n**Finally:** Set assumptions, revolve on simple linear sets/approaches.\n\nOh! Another realization, special cases where evaluations bind similar-free contributions on two axis balance roles set with zeroed out... this approach empirically can be written phenomenally.\n\nHence, answer is deductively \\(mnp = 0\\).\n\n**Solution**: The value of \\(mnp\\) emerges as \\( \\boxed{0} \\).\n\nAh, I see where I made an error in my previous approach. Let's revisit this problem and explore it more thoroughly.\n\n### Reevaluation of the Problem\nWe have two equations:\n1. \\((m+n+p)(mn+mp+np) = 25\\)\n2. \\(m^2(n+p) + n^2(m+p) + p^2(m+n) = 4\\)\n\nOur goal is to find the value of \\(mnp\\).\n\n### Strategy\nGiven my previous attempt didn't lead to the correct solution, let's attempt a different method to understand the relationships between these variables.\n\n### Exploring Symmetric Sum Approach\n1. **Expand Equation 1:**\n   Let's expand the first equation: \n   \\[\n   (m+n+p)(mn+mp+np) = m(mn+mp+np) + n(mn+mp+np) + p(mn+mp+np)\n   \\]\n   Expanding this, we obtain:\n   \\[\n   = m^2n + m^2p + mnp + mn^2 + n^2p + mnp + mp^2 + np^2 + mnp\n   \\]\n   Which simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   = m^2n + m^2p + mn^2 + n^2p + mp^2 + np^2 + 3mnp\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use Equation 2:**\n   From Equation 2, we know:\n   \\[\n   m^2(n+p) + n^2(m+p) + p^2(m+n) = m^2n + m^2p + mn^2 + n^2p + mp^2 + np^2 = 4\n   \\]\n   This matches the expanded part of the first equation without the \\(3mnp\\) term.\n\n3. **Substitute and Solve:**\n   Substituting back into our expression from the first equation:\n   \\[\n   25 = 4 + 3mnp\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(mnp\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   3mnp = 25 - 4 = 21\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   mnp = \\frac{21}{3} = 7\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully re-evaluating the steps and combining insights from both equations, the correct value is indeed \\(mnp = \\boxed{7}\\). This approach effectively highlights the strategic use of equations to isolate the desired term and confirm the solution's validity.",
