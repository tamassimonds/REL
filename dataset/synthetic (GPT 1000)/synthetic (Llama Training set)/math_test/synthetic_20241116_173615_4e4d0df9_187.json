  "problem": "In 1992, a scoop of gelato could be purchased in Italy for 1200 lire. The same gelato would have cost $\\$1.50$ in the U.S. At the equivalent exchange rate between the lire and the dollar, how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem. I'll document my thought process as thoroughly as I can, thinking through each step like I naturally would.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- At first glance, this is an exchange rate problem. We're given the prices in two different currencies for the same item and are asked to figure out the equivalent value for a large sum of one currency in terms of the other.\n- I need to determine the exchange rate between lire and dollars using the provided price information.\n\n### Brainstorming Approaches\n\n1. **Direct Calculation of Exchange Rate:** We can directly calculate the exchange rate by comparing the cost of the gelato in lire and dollars.\n2. **Cross-multiplication formula:** Given that one gelato equals 1200 lire in Italy and $1.50 in the U.S., I could set up a ratio to find out the value of 1,000,000 lire in dollars.\n3. **Unit Conversion Method:** Use the cost comparison to establish a conversion factor and then apply that factor to convert 1,000,000 lire to dollars.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n#### Step 1: Understanding Exchange Rate\n\n- I note that 1 scoop of gelato is 1200 lire in Italy.\n- In the U.S., the same scoop costs $1.50.\n- This gives me an implicit exchange rate of 1200 lire to 1.50 dollars.\n\n#### Step 2: Setting Up the Exchange Rate\n\n- The exchange rate can be found by setting:\n  \\[\n  1200 \\text{ lire} = 1.50 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n- Reflecting on this: This sort of exchange problem requires proportional thinking. For every 1200 lire, we get $1.50. \n\n#### Step 3: Calculating Exchange Rate\n\n- To find 1 lire in terms of dollars:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Exchange rate} = \\frac{1.50 \\text{ dollars}}{1200 \\text{ lire}}\n  \\]\n- When I calculate, this gives:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Exchange rate} = \\frac{1.50}{1200} = 0.00125 \\text{ dollars per lire}\n  \\]\n\n#### Step 4: Convert 1,000,000 lire to Dollars\n\n- With the determined exchange rate, now multiply to find how many dollars are equivalent to 1,000,000 lire:\n  \\[\n  1,000,000 \\text{ lire} \\times 0.00125 \\text{ dollars per lire} = 1250 \\text{ dollars}\n  \\]\n\n#### Verifications and Checks\n\n- **Quick Sanity Check:** Is the exchange rate reasonable? 0.00125 dollars per lire seems like a small but plausible rate since lire was known to hold smaller values against major currencies back in the day.\n- **Reasonableness of Final Amount:** 1,000,000 lire converting to $1250 seems in line with what I'd expect considering the historical strength of the lire.\n\n### Reflection and Conclusion\n\nThis approach makes sense given the structure of the problem \u2014 comparing costs and establishing a conversion factor forms a logical bridge between the two currencies. \n\nIn conclusion, at the time with the given rates, 1,000,000 lire would be equivalent to $1250 in the U.S. This solution process feels complete and satisfactory after multiple checks.",
