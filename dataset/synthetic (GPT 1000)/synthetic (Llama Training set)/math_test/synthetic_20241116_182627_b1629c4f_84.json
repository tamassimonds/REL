    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see what we can figure out. The goal is to determine which type of conic section is represented by the equation \\(x^2 = 2x + 2y - 3\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: This looks like a quadratic equation involving two variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Conic sections include circles, parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas. I know that the general strategy is to rearrange and compare the equation to the standard forms of these conics. \n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Equation\n\nLet's try to rearrange the given equation: \n\n\\[x^2 = 2x + 2y - 3.\\]\n\nHmm. The presence of a single quadratic term in \\(x\\) suggests something. If I isolate terms or rearrange them, I might recognize a standard form.\n\n- Move everything to one side of the equation:\n\n\\[x^2 - 2x - 2y + 3 = 0.\\]\n\nLooking at this, I notice that there isn\u2019t a \\(y^2\\) term. That feels important because different conics typically have both \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\) if they are not parabolas.\n\n### Step 3: Reflect on Conic Sections\n\nAt this point, let's reflect on what the absence of a \\(y^2\\) term implies:\n\n- A circle needs \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\), and their coefficients must be equal.\n- An ellipse also needs both \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\), but they can have different coefficients.\n- A hyperbola likewise requires both \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\), with opposite signs.\n- A parabola, on the other hand, only needs one squared term - either \\(x^2\\) or \\(y^2\\).\n\nSince our equation only has an \\(x^2\\) term, this suggests it might be a parabola.\n\n### Step 4: Try Completing the Square\n\nHmm, to confirm it's a parabola, let's think about completing the square, a common method for simplifying quadratic forms.\n\n1. Focus on the \\(x\\) terms: \\(x^2 - 2x\\).\n2. Complete the square: \n   - Take half the coefficient of \\(x\\), \\(-2\\), which is \\(-1\\), and square it to get \\(1\\).\n   - Rewrite: \\(x^2 - 2x = (x - 1)^2 - 1\\).\n\nSo we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[(x - 1)^2 - 1 - 2y + 3 = 0.\\]\n\nSimplify it to: \n\n\\[(x - 1)^2 = 2y - 2.\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplification and Reflection\n\nSimplifying our equation, we get:\n\n\\[(x - 1)^2 = 2(y - 1).\\]\n\nAh, this is feeling very familiar. This is directly comparable to the standard form of a parabola that opens vertically: \\((x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)\\).\n\nHere, \\((h, k) = (1, 1)\\) and \\(4p = 2\\), so \\(p = \\frac{1}{2}\\). The parabola opens upwards.\n\n### Step 6: Decision\n\nAfter evaluating the characteristics and standard forms of conic sections, it's clear this is indeed a parabola. As a final sanity check, I reminded myself of the absence of any squared \\(y\\) term and the completed-square form aligning with a parabola's structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe given equation \\(x^2 = 2x + 2y - 3\\) represents a **parabola**. Hence, we enter \"P\" for parabola. \n\nReflecting on this, the step-by-step breakdown helped isolate it as a parabola, simply by rearranging and using algebraic properties such as completing the square.",
