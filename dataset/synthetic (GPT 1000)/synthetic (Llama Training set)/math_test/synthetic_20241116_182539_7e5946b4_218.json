    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem step by step. The task is to compute the expression \\(113 + 276 - 13 - 26\\).\n\n### First Thoughts: \nThis problem seems like a straightforward arithmetic calculation. I'm dealing with both addition and subtraction here. Let's dissect it and see what the best strategy might be.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies:\n1. **Direct Approach**: Just process the operations from left to right as they appear. \n    - Pros: Simple and straightforward.\n    - Cons: Might involve handling larger numbers, which could be a bit error-prone without careful attention.\n   \n2. **Grouping and Rearranging**: It might be beneficial to group additions and subtractions separately for clarity.\n    - Pros: Organizes the problems, possibly minimizing the chance of error.\n    - Cons: Requires balancing rearrangement, which might complicate simple calculations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n#### Strategy 1: Direct Approach\n\n1. **Addition First**: \n   - Add the first two numbers: \\(113 + 276\\).\n   - Initial thought: These numbers seem manageable. Let's confirm this.\n\n   - Performing the addition: \n     \\[\n     113 + 276 = 389\n     \\]\n   \n   - Quick check of addition: I think these two numbers summed correctly; 276 adds to the 13 (giving 89) and the remaining 100+200 seems correctly adding to 300.\n\n2. **Subtraction Next**: \n   - Subtract the next two numbers sequentially from the result:\n   \n   - First step: \\[389 - 13\\]\n     - Thought process: 389 minus 10 is 379, and minus another 3 gives 376.\n     - Result: \\[389 - 13 = 376\\]\n\n   - Second step: \\[376 - 26\\]\n     - Thought process: 376 minus 20 is 356, and then minus a further 6 leads to 350.\n     - Result: \\[376 - 26 = 350\\]\n\n#### Strategy 2: Grouping\n\n1. **Grouping Operations for Cleaner Calculation**:\n   - Group and add similar operations together:\n     - \\(113 - 13\\) and \\(276 - 26\\).\n     \n   - Row-wise calculation:\n     - Start with: \\[113 - 13\\] \n       - Simple direct subtraction: 113 minus 10 is 103, minus 3 gives 100.\n       - Result: \\[113 - 13 = 100\\]\n   \n     - Next: \\[276 - 26\\] \n       - Subtracting makes this: 270 minus 20 is 250, then 250 minus 6 results in 244.\n       - Result: \\[276 - 26 = 250\\]\n\n2. **Final Addition**:\n   - Complete the calculation: \\(100 + 250\\).\n   - Straightforward, quick addition of manageable integers:\n     \\[\n     100 + 250 = 350\n     \\]\n\n### Reflection:\n- Both strategies point to the result being **350**. \n- Strategy 2 felt more intuitive as it broke down into smaller parts, allowing for verification between steps. This ease simplifies the complexity of larger numbers.\n- Since both methods agreed, I'm confident the final result is indeed checked correctly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe computed value of the expression \\(113 + 276 - 13 - 26\\) is **350**. Breaking operations and rethinking strategies throughout strengthens understanding and verifies solution accuracy.",
