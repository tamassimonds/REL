    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem together. \n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nOkay, let's start by digesting what's been given. Emily has a bag of marbles in two colors: blue and green. The ratio of green marbles to blue marbles is 3:1. The total number of marbles is 60.\n\n### Step 2: Explore Different Strategies\nI usually like to work with ratios by setting up equations. Ratios often lead to a system of equations or a direct application. Let's see if that works here. But first, let's think about the ratio itself. \n\nIf the ratio of green to blue is 3:1, for every 3 green marbles, there is 1 blue marble. How would that work with the total number of 60 marbles? Hmm.\n\n### Step 3: Set Up an Equation\nLet me try this out: \n\n- Let \\( G \\) represent the number of green marbles.\n- Let \\( B \\) represent the number of blue marbles.\n\nThe ratio gives us the relation:\n\\[ \\frac{G}{B} = \\frac{3}{1} \\]\n\nWe also know:\n\\[ G + B = 60 \\]\n\nThese are two pieces of information we can blend to find our answer.\n\n### Step 4: Express in Terms of a Single Variable\nSince the ratio is \\( \\frac{3}{1} \\), it implies:\n\\[ G = 3B \\]\n\nPerfect. Let's substitute this into the total number of marbles equation:\n\\[ 3B + B = 60 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve the Equation\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 4B = 60 \\]\n\nOkay, let's pause a second\u2026 if 4 times the number of blue marbles equals 60, then:\n\\[ B = \\frac{60}{4} = 15 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Quick Check\nWait, does this really make sense? If there are 15 blue marbles and the ratio requires 3 times as many green marbles, then:\n\\[ G = 3 \\times 15 = 45 \\]\n\nAdding up to the total:\n\\[ G + B = 45 + 15 = 60 \\]\n\nYup, all checks out. This works with the info we have.\n\n### Final Reflection\nEverything seems solid. The mechanism: the ratio turned into a straightforward multiplication, using it with the total gave us an easy path to solve. The total reflects the constraints perfectly - isn't that satisfying?\n\n### Conclusion\nThe number of blue marbles in the bag is \\( \\boxed{15} \\). \n\nSeems like a straightforward problem when broken down\u2014thanks to the structured approach of ratios to equations. It's neat how these pieces fit!",

  },
  "ground_truth": "Since the ratio of green to blue marbles is $3$ to $1$, this means that for every $3$ green marbles there is $1$ blue marble and thus only $1$ out of every $4$ marbles in the bag is blue.  Thus the total number of blue marbles in the bag is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times 60=\\boxed{15}$"
