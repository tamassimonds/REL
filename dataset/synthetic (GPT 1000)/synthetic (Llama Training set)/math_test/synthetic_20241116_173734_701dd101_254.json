    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this and take it step by step. This problem involves simplifying a complex fractional expression with square roots. Here's what comes to mind initially:\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- Immediately, I recognize this involves division of fractions, and both the numerator and denominator have square roots. \n- It looks like the properties of square roots and fractions can help simplify this.\n- The expression \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{24}}{\\sqrt{30}}\\div\\frac{\\sqrt{20}}{3\\sqrt{25}}\\) could potentially simplify by rationalizing or simplifying the square roots first.\n\nI'm reminded of some property of division with fractions: \\(\\frac{a}{b} \\div \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{d}{c}\\). This will probably help. \n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n#### Step 1: Deal with the Division\n\nLet's rewrite this division problem:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{24}}{\\sqrt{30}} \\div \\frac{\\sqrt{20}}{3\\sqrt{25}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{24}}{\\sqrt{30}} \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{25}}{\\sqrt{20}}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Simplify the roots individually\n\n- **For \\(\\sqrt{24}\\)**: \n  \\(\\sqrt{24} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 6} = \\sqrt{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{6} = 2\\sqrt{6}\\)\n\n- **For \\(\\sqrt{30}\\)**: \n  \\(\\sqrt{30}\\) does not break down into a simpler square, so it stays as is.\n\n- **For \\(\\sqrt{25}\\)**: \n  \\(\\sqrt{25} = 5\\)\n\n- **For \\(\\sqrt{20}\\)**:\n  \\(\\sqrt{20} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 5} = \\sqrt{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 2\\sqrt{5}\\)\n\nGreat, now let's put all this back together.\n\n#### Step 3: Substitute simplifications back\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{30}} \\cdot \\frac{3 \\cdot 5}{2\\sqrt{5}}\n = \\frac{2\\sqrt{6} \\cdot 15}{\\sqrt{30} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\nCancel out the \\(2\\)\u2019s:\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\sqrt{6} \\cdot 15}{\\sqrt{30} \\cdot \\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 4: Combine the Square Roots\n\nCombine the square roots in the denominator:\n\\[\n= \\frac{15\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{30 \\cdot 5}} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{150}}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 5: Simplify \\(\\sqrt{150}\\)\n\n\\(\\sqrt{150} = \\sqrt{25 \\cdot 6} = 5\\sqrt{6}\\)\n\nSubstitute back in:\n\\[\n= \\frac{15\\sqrt{6}}{5\\sqrt{6}}\n\\]\n\nCancel out \\(\\sqrt{6}\\):\n\\[\n= \\frac{15}{5} = 3\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nWe\u2019ve simplified everything correctly, and it made sense every step of the way. Each simplification was checked, and it turns out the answer to the original complex-looking expression is \\(3\\).\n\nThat clicked! Breaking it down really revealed how straightforward it became once handled systematically. I'm confident in this solution because each step was verified, and the logical structure held throughout the process.",
