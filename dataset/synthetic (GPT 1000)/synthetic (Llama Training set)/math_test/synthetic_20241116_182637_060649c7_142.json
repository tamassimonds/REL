    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. \n\n**First Impression and Brainstorming:**\n\nAt first glance, this problem asks us to find the shortest line segment that is tangent to two circles. I immediately recall that this might be related to the concept of external tangents between two circles. These are lines that touch each circle exactly at one point from the outer side.\n\nNow, let\u2019s break down the information we have:\n\n- The circle $C_1$ is centered at (10, 0) with radius 6.\n- The circle $C_2$ is centered at (-15, 0) with radius 9.\n\nIntuitively, the shortest line segment should be one of these tangents between the two circles.\n\nLet\u2019s dig a bit deeper now:\n\n1. **Understanding Tangents:**\n\n   - External tangents are lines that touch the circles without crossing the space in between them, unlike internal tangents.\n   - The shortest such line typically occurs when tangent lines are coherent with respect to the circles' positions and alignment in the plane.\n\n2. **Evaluate Circle Configuration:**\n\n   Circles $C_1$ and $C_2$ are positioned along the x-axis. Their centers are at (10, 0) and (-15, 0), respectively. This setup is symmetric about the y-axis due to their y=0 coordinate.\n\n**Mathematical Approach:**\n\n3. **Distance between Centers:**\n\n   Let's calculate the distance between the centers of $C_1$ and $C_2$. This is crucial because the tangents are dependent on their relative positioning.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(10 - (-15))^2} = \\sqrt{25^2} = 25\n   \\]\n\n4. **The External Tangent Formula:**\n\n   If $d$ is the distance between the centers, $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the radii, the length of the external tangent, say $L$, can be found using:\n\n   \\[\n   L = \\sqrt{d^2 - (r_1 + r_2)^2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substitute the Values:**\n\n   - \\( r_1 = 6 \\)\n   - \\( r_2 = 9 \\)\n   - \\( d = 25 \\)\n\n   Plug these values into the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   L = \\sqrt{25^2 - (6 + 9)^2} = \\sqrt{625 - 225} = \\sqrt{400} = 20\n   \\]\n\nThis 20 represents the length of the shortest external tangent that touches both circles from the outside.\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\nOkay, I should verify:\n\n- **Is this approach consistent with geometry theory?** Yes, using the external tangent formula directly applies to these problems.\n- **Were calculations done correctly?** A quick mental recalculation of squares confirms \\(25^2 = 625\\) and \\((6+9)^2 = 225\\).\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThis approach aligns with geometric intuition and provides consistent mathematical confirmation. The shortest tangent segment $PQ$ between these circles is 20 units in length. \n\nI'm quite confident that this is correct after thorough checking and cross-referencing with geometric principles of circle tangents. Any insight or simplification through symmetry or different positioning hasn't been overlooked, and recalculating verifies no arithmetic mistakes have been made.\n\nHence, the length of the shortest line segment $PQ$ is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",
