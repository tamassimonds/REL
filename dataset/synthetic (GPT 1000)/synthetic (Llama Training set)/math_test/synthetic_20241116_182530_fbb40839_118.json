    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and try to solve it step by step.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem involves a car traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, and we need to find out how many minutes it will take to travel 20 miles. This sounds like a rate question, and I remember something about the relationship between time, speed, and distance from previous problems. \n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- One approach could involve directly using the formula for speed, which is speed = distance/time. I think we can rearrange this to solve for time: time = distance/speed.\n- Another route could be to set up a proportion because we know the speed in terms of a mile per hour \u2013 if we know how long it takes to travel one mile, we could scale that up to see how long it takes for 20 miles.\n\nIt feels like both methods might work, but let's start with the time = distance/speed method since it feels more direct.\n\n**Applying the Formula:**\n\n1. **Use the formula:**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute given values:**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{20 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ miles per hour}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the time:**  \n   When I do the division, I remember to keep track of the units:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hour}\n   \\]\n\nWait, I need to convert hours to minutes because the problem asks for minutes.\n\n**Conversion:**\n\n- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Minutes} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hour} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Reflection:**\n\nThat seems to make sense. If the car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, it's covering 1 mile per minute, so covering 20 miles in 20 minutes logically checks out. \n\n**Checking Approach:**\n\n- Revisiting the proportion idea: Since we know the car travels 60 miles in 60 minutes, scaling proportionally works:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{20 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ miles}} = \\frac{\\text{time}}{60 \\text{ minutes}}\n  \\]\n  Cross-multiply to solve:\n  \\[\n  20 \\times 60 = 60 \\times \\text{time}\n  \\]\n  Solving gives time = 20 minutes, which confirms our initial approach.\n\nThere's this reassuring feeling of everything lining up correctly. No discrepancies that I see. The approach makes sense both analytically and intuitively. \n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nIt will take Jeremiah 20 minutes to travel 20 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour.",
