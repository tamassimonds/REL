    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nThe given equation is \\( (2^x - 2)(5 \\cdot 2^x + 10) = 3 \\cdot 4^x + 12 \\). At first glance, it looks like a problem that involves exponents and requires some algebraic manipulation. My first impression is that we might need to simplify both sides or manipulate one side to resemble the other.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify and Explore Possibilities**\n\nLet's start by simplifying the expressions both inside the parentheses and on the right side:\n\n- The left side, \\( (2^x - 2)(5 \\cdot 2^x + 10) \\), can be expanded. \n  - Distributive property might help here: \n  - I'll expand directly: \\((2^x - 2) \\times 5 \\cdot 2^x + (2^x - 2) \\times 10\\).\n  \n- The right side of the equation is \\( 3 \\cdot 4^x + 12 \\).\n  - 4 can be written as \\( 2^2 \\), so this becomes \\( 3 \\cdot (2^2)^x + 12 = 3 \\cdot 2^{2x} + 12\\).\n\nThis re-writing helps identify any potential common terms. \n\n**Rewriting Step-by-Step:**\n\nOn the left side:\n\n1. \\( (2^x - 2)(5 \\cdot 2^x + 10) \\) \n    - becomes \\( 5 \\cdot 2^{2x} + 10 \\cdot 2^x - 10 \\cdot 2^x - 20 \\).\n\nSimplifying gives \\( 5 \\cdot 2^{2x} - 20 \\).\n\n- The simplified version of the left side is \\( 5 \\cdot 2^{2x} - 20 \\).\n\nOn the right side:\n\n- Already simplified to \\( 3 \\cdot 2^{2x} + 12 \\).\n\n**Check Parity and Adjust Terms:**\n\nLet's equate similar terms:\n\n- From the equation \\( 5 \\cdot 2^{2x} - 20 = 3 \\cdot 2^{2x} + 12 \\).\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[ 5 \\cdot 2^{2x} - 3 \\cdot 2^{2x} = 12 + 20 \\]\n\nThis becomes:\n\n\\[ 2 \\cdot 2^{2x} = 32 \\]\n\nSimplifying gives us:\n\n\\[ 2^{2x + 1} = 32 \\]\n\n**Reflection: Check if this feels right**\n\nThis step feels logical. We adjusted terms, simplified effectively, and reduced complexity. I'll proceed to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n**Step 2: Solve \\(2^{2x + 1} = 32\\)**\n\n- Recognize that \\(32 = 2^5\\), therefore:\n  \n  - \\(2^{2x + 1} = 2^5\\)\n  \nEquate the exponents because the bases are the same:\n\n- \\(2x + 1 = 5\\)\n\nNow solve for \\(x\\):\n\n- \\(2x = 5 - 1\\)\n- \\(2x = 4\\)\n- \\(x = \\frac{4}{2}\\)\n- \\(x = 2\\)\n\n**Quick Check: Verify whether the solved value is correct**\n\nNow let's double-check:\n\nPlug \\(x = 2\\) back into the expressions:\n\n1. Left side: \n   - \\(2^2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2\\)\n   - \\(5 \\cdot 2^2 + 10 = 5 \\cdot 4 + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30\\)\n   - Thus left side: \\(2 \\times 30 = 60\\)\n\n2. Right side:\n   - \\(3 \\cdot 4^2 + 12 = 3 \\cdot 16 + 12 = 48 + 12 = 60\\)\n\nBoth sides equal \\(60\\), confirming \\(x = 2\\) as correct.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n- The value of \\(x\\) is indeed \\(2\\). \n\nApproach validated by substitution, leading to satisfied original conditions. \n\nThis thorough iterative approach balances between algebraic manipulation and logical checks at each stage.",
