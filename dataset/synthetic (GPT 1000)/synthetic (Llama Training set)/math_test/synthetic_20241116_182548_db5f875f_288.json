    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive in.\n\nFirst thoughts: Hm, this problem looks like it involves exponents, specifically multiplying different powers of the same base. That reminds me of the property of exponents I learned where you can add exponents together when multiplying terms with the same base. Let's see if I can apply that here.\n\nStep 1: Identify the base and apply exponent rules.  \nThe question involves three terms: \\(3^{-4}\\), \\(3^{-8}\\), and \\(3^{14}\\). They all share the same base of 3. This suggests that I can use the exponent multiplication rule: \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\).\n\nStep 2: Check the exponent rule applies.   \nOkay, let's give it a try:  \n\\[3^{-4} \\cdot 3^{-8} \\cdot 3^{14} = 3^{-4 + (-8) + 14}\\]\n\nLet's simplify this step by step:\n\n- First, calculate \\(-4 + (-8)\\):  \n  \\(-4 - 8 = -12\\).  \n  That doesn\u2019t look too hard. \n\n- Now add 14 to \\(-12\\):  \n  \\(-12 + 14 = 2\\).  \n  Okay, this step seems logical.\n\nStep 3: Put it together using the exponent rule.  \nSo, \\(3^{-4} \\cdot 3^{-8} \\cdot 3^{14} = 3^{2}\\).\n\nStep 4: Reflecting on the intermediary steps feels pretty solid. Nothing seems off based on what I understand about exponents. Let's just ensure I captured the right operations:\n\n- Adding all the exponents: Yes, \\( (-4) + (-8) + 14 \\) was indeed calculated correctly to result in 2.\n\nStep 5: Convert the exponentiation into a familiar number.  \nNow, \\(3^2\\) is quite simple to compute:  \n\\[3^2 = 3 \\times 3 = 9\\].  \n\nFinal Thoughts:  \nThis seems to make sense and follows the rules of exponents well. I don't see any major issues, and the arithmetic checks out. It\u2019s always good to remind myself of these rules, especially since they simplify complex expressions into something manageable.\n\nTo recap, the original problem simplifies using the exponent addition rule, and the answer comes out to be 9.\n\nFinal answer: \\(9\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We can use the property  $$a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$$to multiply two exponents together, but first we can extend it to all three exponents. In our situation, we have $a^m \\cdot a^n \\cdot a^k$. By using this multiplication property on the first two numbers and then on the remaining two numbers, we get  $$a^m \\cdot a^n \\cdot a^k = a^{m+n} \\cdot a^k = a^{(m+n)+k} = a^{m+n+k}.$$Now we can use this property,  $$a^m \\cdot a^n \\cdot a^k = a^{m+n+k},$$to give $$3^{-4} \\cdot 3^{-8} \\cdot 3^{14} = 3^{(-4)+(-8)+14} = 3^{-12+14} = 3^2 = \\boxed{9}.$$"
