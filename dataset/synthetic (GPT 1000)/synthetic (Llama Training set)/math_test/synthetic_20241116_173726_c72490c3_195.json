    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find a quadratic with real coefficients, with \\(x^2\\) as the quadratic term, that has \\(5-4i\\) as a root.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The problem states that the quadratic should have real coefficients and one root is \\(5-4i\\). This immediately makes me recall the property of polynomials with real coefficients: if a complex number is a root, its complex conjugate must also be a root. So my first thought is, the quadratic should also have \\(5+4i\\) as another root.\n\n- A standard quadratic equation with roots \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) can be written as \\( (x - r_1)(x - r_2) \\). So in this case, we can express the quadratic as \\((x - (5-4i))(x - (5+4i))\\).\n\nBefore proceeding with the multiplication, let's reflect if this approach makes sense:\n- Yes, it looks correct as per the principle of complex conjugates for real-coefficient polynomials.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nNow let's multiply these factors to obtain the quadratic:\n\n\\[\n(x - (5-4i))(x - (5+4i)) = (x - 5 + 4i)(x - 5 - 4i)\n\\]\n\nRecognizing this as a form reminiscent of the difference of squares, we can expand it using the formula:\n\n\\[\n(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a = x-5\\) and \\(b = 4i\\). By substituting, we find:\n\n\\[\n(x-5)^2 - (4i)^2\n\\]\n\nCalculate each part:\n\n1. \\( (x-5)^2 = x^2 - 10x + 25 \\)\n\n2. \\( (4i)^2 = 16i^2 = 16(-1) = -16 \\) (since \\(i^2 = -1\\), so \\(16i^2 = -16\\)).\n\nSubstitute back:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x + 25 - (-16) = x^2 - 10x + 25 + 16 = x^2 - 10x + 41\n\\]\n\nWe have the quadratic: \\(x^2 - 10x + 41\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Let's quickly verify that \\(5-4i\\) and \\(5+4i\\) are indeed the roots. We\u2019ll use the formula for the sum and product of roots:\n  - The sum of the roots \\((5-4i) + (5+4i) = 10\\), which matches the \\(-b/a\\) form of a quadratic, where \\(b\\) is the coefficient of \\(x\\). Here \\(-(-10) = 10\\).\n  - The product of the roots \\((5-4i)(5+4i) = 5^2 - (4i)^2 = 25 - (-16) = 41\\) matches the constant term of the quadratic \\(c/a\\), and here it\u2019s \\(41/1 = 41\\).\n\nThis approach confirms that the quadratic \\(x^2 - 10x + 41\\) is correct with the given root criteria and real coefficients.\n\n**Reflect:**\n\n- I'm confident in the solution, as every check aligns with the given problem's requirements. The process naturally accounts for both the roots and the complex conjugate property.\n\nPerfect! We've successfully derived and verified the quadratic equation.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the root $5-4i$ is nonreal but the coefficients of the quadratic are real, the roots must form a conjugate pair. Therefore, the other root is $\\overline{5-4i} = 5+4i.$\n\nTo find the quadratic, we can note that the sum of the roots is $5-4i+5+4i=10$ and the product is $(5-4i)(5+4i) = 25+16=41.$ Then by Vieta's formulas, we know that the quadratic $\\boxed{x^2-10x+41}$ has $5-4i$ as a root."
