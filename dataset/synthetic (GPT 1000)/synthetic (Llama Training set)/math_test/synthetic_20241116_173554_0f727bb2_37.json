    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this and take it step by step. The problem asks for the greatest common factor (GCF) of three factorial numbers: \\(5!\\), \\(10!\\), and \\(15!\\). The numbers \\(5!\\), \\(10!\\), and \\(15!\\) indicate \"five factorial\", \"ten factorial\", and \"fifteen factorial\" respectively, which means multiplying all whole numbers from 1 up to that number. I'm trying to determine the largest factor that all three of these numbers share.\n\nInitial Thoughts:\n- This reminds me of finding the GCF of regular numbers using prime factorization, but now it's with factorials, which feels more complex.\n- I need a strategy for dealing with factorials because these grow super fast. Scrambling these massive products directly isn't practical.\n\nStep 1: Breakdown the Factorials\n- Let's break down what these factorials mean and then identify the prime factors:\n  - \\(5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\)\n  - \\(10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\)\n  - \\(15! = 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\)\n\nStep 2: Prime Factorization\n- Maybe the key is finding the GCF of the smallest factorial and the others \u2013 i.e., using \\(5!\\) as a base.\n- Another approach: check common factors by focusing on shared prime numbers present in each factorial.\n\n- First observe: Every factorial number inherently includes multiples from \\(1\\) up to its value.\n- Therefore, \\(5!\\) is entirely contained within \\(10!\\) and \\(15!\\), and its factors are, too. It seems \\(5!\\) might be our GCF candidate.\n\nStep 3: Check Commonality of Base Factorial\n- Verify if \\(5!\\) divides both \\(10!\\) and \\(15!\\):\n  - Since every integer up to 5 must naturally occur in the factorization of 10! and 15!, all products of \\(5!\\) (i.e., smaller factors) are present in \\(10!\\), \\(15!\\).\n\nReflection:\n- I double-checked the logic and it seems that our candidate \\(5!\\), due to being completely within 10! and 15!, is realistically our GCF.\n- Evaluating primes shared by 5, 10, and 15 are all covered by the factorization, implying that the smallest contributes to the largest shared unique identity number (the factorial itself).\n\nFinal Calculation:\n\\(5! = 120\\)\n\nConclusion: \nThe greatest common factor of \\(5!\\), \\(10!\\), and \\(15!\\) is definitely \\(5!\\), which equals 120. I feel confident about this approach. The nature of factorials means that once you've accounted for the smallest, those factors are consistently embedded in any larger factorial product. Thus, \\(5!\\) is our greatest common factor in this context.",

  "ground_truth": "Note that $5!$ divides $10!$ and $5!$ divides $15!$.  Since $5!$ has no factor larger than $5!$, and $5!$ is a factor of all three, the answer is $5!=\\boxed{120}$."
