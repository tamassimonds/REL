    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n\nOkay, we have an equation: \\((2x+1)(3x+2) = (x-3)(6x-5)\\). This looks like a standard algebraic equation involving products on both sides. I've seen similar quadratic equations before, so I'm inclined to think that perhaps expanding both sides could be a good starting point. This will probably lead to a quadratic equation where I can then simplify and solve for \\(x\\).\n\nBrainstorming Strategies:\n\n1. Expanding both sides to simplify the equation.\n2. Moving all terms to one side to set the equation to zero, which might form a quadratic equation.\n3. Trying to factor the quadratic if possible, or otherwise using the quadratic formula to solve for \\(x\\).\n\nLet's start with the expansion approach:\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Expand the Left Side:**\n\n   \\((2x + 1)(3x + 2)\\)\n\n   Using the distributive property (or FOIL method for binomials):\n\n   - First: \\(2x \\cdot 3x = 6x^2\\)\n   - Outer: \\(2x \\cdot 2 = 4x\\)\n   - Inner: \\(1 \\cdot 3x = 3x\\)\n   - Last: \\(1 \\cdot 2 = 2\\)\n\n   Combine these: \n\n   \\(6x^2 + 4x + 3x + 2 = 6x^2 + 7x + 2\\)\n\n2. **Expand the Right Side:**\n\n   \\((x-3)(6x-5)\\)\n\n   Again, using the distributive property:\n\n   - First: \\(x \\cdot 6x = 6x^2\\)\n   - Outer: \\(x \\cdot -5 = -5x\\)\n   - Inner: \\(-3 \\cdot 6x = -18x\\)\n   - Last: \\(-3 \\cdot -5 = 15\\)\n\n   Combine these: \n\n   \\(6x^2 - 5x - 18x + 15 = 6x^2 - 23x + 15\\)\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation:**\n\n   Now, equate the expanded forms:\n\n   \\(6x^2 + 7x + 2 = 6x^2 - 23x + 15\\)\n\n4. **Simplify and Rearrange:**\n\n   Subtract \\(6x^2\\) from both sides to eliminate the quadratic term:\n\n   \\(7x + 2 = -23x + 15\\)\n\n   Add \\(23x\\) to both sides to collect the \\(x\\) terms:\n\n   \\(7x + 23x + 2 = 15\\)\n\n   Combine \\(x\\) terms:\n\n   \\(30x + 2 = 15\\)\n\n   Subtract 2 from both sides:\n\n   \\(30x = 13\\)\n\n5. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n\n   Divide both sides by 30:\n\n   \\(x = \\frac{13}{30}\\)\n\nChecking My Work:\n\n- Quick thought: Does this fraction make sense? It\u2019s not an integer, but not all equations yield integer solutions. The process seems logical.\n- Deep reflection: Re-evaluate the algebraic steps, ensuring no arithmetic errors were made during expansion and simplification.\n\nThere it is! The solution to the equation is \\(x = \\frac{13}{30}\\).\n\nFinal thoughts were to consider if simplification could have been done differently or if the initial attempt failed, but the checking steps confirmed this solution is consistent with the problem's setup.",
