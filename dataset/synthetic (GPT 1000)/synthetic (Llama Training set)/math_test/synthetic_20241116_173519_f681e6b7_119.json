    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and break it down step by step.\n\n### Initial Exploration:\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nThis problem reminds me of polynomial multiplication problems where we need to compare coefficients. I'm thinking we might be able to use the comparison of the expanded polynomials to identify the unknown coefficients `a` and `b`. It's like those problems where you expand two polynomials and then match the coefficients, or even like solving a system of equations based on polynomial identities.\n\n### Strategy Brainstorming:\n\n- **Method 1: Full Expansion:**\n  We can expand the product of the polynomials and then match the coefficients with the given polynomial on the right-hand side. \n\n- **Method 2: Coefficient Matching:**\n  Alternatively, we could attempt to match coefficients directly without full expansion. Focus on specific terms that would make the comparison easier.\n\n- **Insight:**\n  There's a middle ground where we use only the necessary terms from the expanded form to make our work lighter.\n\n### Start Working:\n\n**Step 1: Matching the Highest Degree Terms:**\n\nThe highest degree term in the product \\( (3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) \\) should be \\( 12t^4 \\). How do we get \\( t^4 \\) terms?\n\nWe multiply: \n\\[ 3t^2 \\times 4t^2 = 12t^4 \\]\n\nCool! This matches the given \\( 12t^4 \\). We are on track so far since there's no other way to form a \\( t^4 \\) term.\n\n**Step 2: Matching the \\( t^3 \\) Coefficient:**\n\nNext, we compare the \\( t^3 \\) terms. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. \\( 3t^2 \\times bt = 3bt^3 \\)\n2. \\( 5t \\times 4t^2 = 20t^3 \\)\n\nCombining these, we expect:\n\\[\n3bt^3 + 20t^3 = 26t^3\n\\]\nComparing coefficients, we get:\n\\[ 3b + 20 = 26 \\]\n\nFrom this, \\( 3b = 6 \\) which implies \\( b = 2 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Reflect and Check Progress**\n\nSo far, this seems correct. Checking back with the initial polynomial, we aren't missing any logic for the highest degree terms, and our \\( t^3 \\) coefficient checks out. On to finding \\( a \\).\n\n**Step 4: Matching the \\( t^2 \\) Coefficient:**\n\nConsider the expressions that give \\( t^2 \\) terms:\n\n1. \\( 3t^2 \\times (-2) = -6t^2 \\)\n2. \\( 5t \\times 2t = 10t^2 \\) \n3. \\( a \\times 4t^2 = 4at^2 \\)\n\nSumming these gives:\n\\[\n-6t^2 + 10t^2 + 4at^2 = -8t^2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\\[\n4a + 4 = -8\n\\]\n\nThis results in \\( 4a = -12 \\), giving \\( a = -3 \\).\n\n**Step 5: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\nNow, let's make sure we found the correct results by verifying consistent logic:\n\n- The fourth-step calculation made sense because we handled each potential source of \\( t^2 \\) terms.\n\nThe final task is to find \\( a + b \\):\n\n\\[ a + b = -3 + 2 = -1 \\]\n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nBoth the calculation for \\( b = 2 \\) and \\( a = -3 \\) adhered neatly to our strategy of matching coefficients from polynomial multiplication. This approach verifies our solution throughout, making \\( a + b = -1 \\) correct.\n\nThat's our solution!",

  "ground_truth": "The constant term of the product of two polynomials is just the product of the two constant terms. Therefore we know that $6=-2a$, so $a=-3$. We now consider the linear term of the product of our polynomials. It's given by $-16t=(5t\\cdot-2)+a\\cdot bt\\Longrightarrow-16t=-10t+(-3)bt\\Longrightarrow b=2$. Therefore our answer is $a+b=\\boxed{-1}$."
