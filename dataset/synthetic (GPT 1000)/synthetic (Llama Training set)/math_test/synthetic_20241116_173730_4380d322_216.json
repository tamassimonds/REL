    "working_out": "#### Initial Thoughts\n\nOkay, I'm looking at the absolute value inequality \\( |x-2| \\leq 5.6 \\). This reminds me of how absolute value inequalities represent distances on a number line. The inequality is essentially saying that the distance between \\( x \\) and 2 is at most 5.6 units. So, I can translate this into a range of values for \\( x \\).\n\n#### Brainstorming & Translating the Inequality\n\n1. **Understanding Absolute Values**: \n   \\[ |x-2| \\leq 5.6 \\] can be translated to:\n   - \\( x - 2 \\leq 5.6 \\) and \n   - \\( x - 2 \\geq -5.6 \\).\n\n   This sounds right because that's how the absolute value inequality splits into two conditions.\n\n2. **Solving Each Inequality**:\n   - For \\( x - 2 \\leq 5.6 \\):\n     \\[\n     x \\leq 7.6\n     \\]\n   - For \\( x - 2 \\geq -5.6 \\):\n     \\[\n     x \\geq -3.6\n     \\]\n\n3. **Bringing It Together**:\n   Combining both results, I have:\n   \\[\n   -3.6 \\leq x \\leq 7.6\n   \\]\n\n   So, \\( x \\) can range from \\(-3.6\\) to \\(7.6\\).\n\n#### Finding Integer Solutions\n\n4. **Identifying Integers in the Range**:\n   I know integers are whole numbers, so I need to find integers within the interval \\(-3.6\\) to \\(7.6\\).\n\n   - Minimum integer in the range: The closest integer greater than \\(-3.6\\) is \\(-3\\).\n   - Maximum integer in the range: The closest integer less than \\(7.6\\) is \\(7\\).\n\n5. **Listing and Counting the Integers**:\n   - The integers from \\(-3\\) to \\(7\\) are: \\(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\).\n   - Counting these, I see there are 11 integers.\n\n#### Reflection & Double Checking\n\n6. **Quick Verification**:\n   - I've translated the inequality correctly.\n   - Both the negative and positive range calculations match the logical structure of absolute values, so my inequality let's x exist from \\(-3.6\\) to \\(7.6\\), capturing these integers.\n\n7. **Final Confirmation**:\n   Everything seems to check out, and my steps seem logical. The number of integers that satisfy the inequality \\( |x-2| \\leq 5.6 \\) is indeed **11**.\n\nThis approach seems sound: step-by-step, relating it back to number lines, reflecting, and ensuring calculations align with logical expectations for integer counting.",

  "ground_truth": "Getting rid of the absolute value, we have $-5.6 \\le x-2 \\le 5.6$, or $-3.6 \\le x \\le 7.6$. Thus, $x$ can be any integer from -3 to 7, inclusive. There are $7-(-3)+1=\\boxed{11}$ integers in this range."
