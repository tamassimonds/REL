    "working_out": "Alright, let's get into this problem. Real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have an arithmetic mean of 7 and a geometric mean of \\(\\sqrt{19}\\). We're tasked with finding \\(x^2 + y^2\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- Arithmetic mean tells us \\(\\frac{x + y}{2} = 7\\). This simplifies to \\(x + y = 14\\).\n- Geometric mean tells us \\(\\sqrt{xy} = \\sqrt{19}\\). Squaring both sides, we get \\(xy = 19\\).\n\n**Initial Strategy:**\nIt feels like I'm dealing with a situation similar to finding sums and products of roots in quadratic equations. Maybe I can use these to express \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in some manageable form, trying to find \\(x^2 + y^2\\).\n\n**Attempt Using Algebraic Identities:**\n- We know from algebra that \\((x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy\\).\n- We can rearrange this to \\(x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy\\).\n\n**Substitution:**\n- Substitute \\(x + y = 14\\) and \\(xy = 19\\) into the identity:\n  \\[\n  x^2 + y^2 = 14^2 - 2 \\cdot 19\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x^2 + y^2 = 196 - 38\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x^2 + y^2 = 158\n  \\]\n\n**Check Everything**:\n- My expression for \\(x^2 + y^2\\) is derived correctly from my identities.\n- The substitution and calculation steps seem accurate.\n\n**Overall Reflection**:\nEverything fits nicely. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 158\\) sounds correct given the arithmetic and geometric means we started with. This solution matches typical steps for problems involving symmetry and simple algebraic identities. \n\n**Conclusion**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{158}\n\\]\n\nIt feels pretty satisfying when the pieces fall into place logically like this, particularly with straightforward calculations leading to a clean result. It's always worth double-checking assumptions and calculations when dealing with algebra, but everything looks good here.",
