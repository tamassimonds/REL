    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step. Initially, when I read the problem that says \"the sum of two numbers is 25 and their difference is 9,\" it seems like a classic algebra problem. I need to find the two numbers and then their product. \n\nTo begin with, the problem mentions both sum and difference, which immediately makes me think about setting up a system of equations. So, let's start by trying that route:\n\n**Brainstorming Initial Variables and Equations:**\n1. Let's assign variables to the two numbers: let \\( x \\) be the first number and \\( y \\) be the second number.\n2. The first equation from the sum is:  \n   \\( x + y = 25 \\).\n3. The second equation from the difference is:  \n   \\( x - y = 9 \\).\n\n**Checking the Understanding:**\n- These equations seem straightforward enough. Using algebra seems like the right approach here.\n\n**Using the System of Equations:**\n- Now, to get the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we can solve these two equations simultaneously.\n- My first thought is to use the elimination method because the equations are nicely set up for it.\n\n**Solving for One of the Variables:**\n1. If we add the two equations:\n   \\[\n   (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 9\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   2x = 34\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{34}{2} = 17\n   \\]\n\n**Substituting Back to Find the Other Variable:**\n- Now that I've got \\( x = 17 \\), I can substitute this back into one of the original equations to find \\( y \\). Using the equation \\( x + y = 25 \\):\n  \\[\n  17 + y = 25\n  \\]\n  Solving for \\( y \\):\n  \\[\n  y = 25 - 17 = 8\n  \\]\n\n**Checking the Calculation:**\n- I have \\( x = 17 \\) and \\( y = 8 \\). It's a good idea to check these in the second equation: \\( x - y = 9 \\).\n  \\[\n  17 - 8 = 9\n  \\]\n  Yes, this is correct! \n\n**Finding the Product:**\n- With both values confirmed, it's time to calculate their product:\n  \\[\n  17 \\times 8\n  \\]\n  Multiplying these two numbers:\n  \\[\n  17 \\times 8 = 136\n  \\]\n\n**Reflecting on the Solution:**\n- Looking back at our steps, everything aligns with the conditions given in the problem. The whole process from setting up the equations, solving for each variable, and checking the results have come together well.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The product of the two numbers is \\( 136 \\). \n\nThis step-by-step approach helped ensure clarity and accuracy. We've also verified each step logically, which gives confidence in the result.",

  "ground_truth": "We can represent the given information with the following system of linear equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 25, \\\\\nx - y &= 9.\n\\end{align*}To find the product of $x$ and $y$, solve for each independently.\n\nBegin by adding the two equations:  \\begin{align*}\n2x &= 34 \\\\\nx &= 17\n\\end{align*}Substituting in for $x$ yields a value of $8$ for $y$.\n\nHence, $x \\cdot y = 17 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{136}$"
