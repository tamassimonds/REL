    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem bit by bit:\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst off, the question is about finding how many four-digit palindromic integers I can make using the digits 2, 3, 4, and 5. \n\n**Palindromes** have a special characteristic: they read the same forwards and backwards. So for a four-digit palindrome, the first and last digits must be the same, and the second and third digits must also be the same. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n- We are dealing with four-digit numbers, which means the structure of a palindrome will be something like ABBA where \"A\" and \"B\" are digits.\n- I can use the digits 2, 3, 4, or 5 for both positions \"A\" and \"B\".\n- Since each of these digits can be used any number of times, I might think about all possible combinations of these digits.\n\n### Strategy Exploration\n1. **Understanding 'A':** Since 'A' can be any of the four given digits, let's list out those possibilities: 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n2. **Understanding 'B':** Since 'B' can also be any of the four digits, we follow the same logic.\n\nBy examining the structure:\n\n- A _ _ A (4 options for A: 2, 3, 4, 5)\n- _ B B _ (4 options for B: 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n### Calculation of Possibilities\nAlright, let's calculate:\n\n1. Choices for A: 4 (2, 3, 4, or 5)\n2. Choices for B: 4 (2, 3, 4, or 5)\n\nNow, since A and B are independent of each other, I can multiply the number of possibilities for A and B together to find the total number of palindromic numbers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Palindromes} = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\]\n\n### Reflecting on the Approach\n- This seems correct: The palindrome constraint (first equals last digit, and second equals third digit) nicely reduced the problem's complexity.\n- I checked if there were any constraints I missed. The problem states any of the digits can be used any number of times, so there's no constraint about repetition.\n  \n### Verification\nTo double-check, I could quickly list some examples:\n\n- If A = 2, B = 2, I'll have 2222.\n- If A = 2, B = 3, I'll have 2332.\n- If A = 3, B = 4, I'll have 3443.\n- If A = 5, B = 5, I'll have 5555.\n\nThis informal sampling checks out with my calculation.\n\n### Final Answer\nSo, the number of such four-digit palindromes is **16**. This was a concise problem that broke down nicely once I focused on the palindrome structure and used the digits independently for those repeating positions.",

  "ground_truth": "If the four-digit integer is to be a palindrome, then the third digit must be the same as the second and the fourth must be the same as the first.  So, once we choose the first two digits, we can only form the palindrome in one way. There are 4 choices for the first digit and 4 choices for the second digit, so there are $4 \\times 4 = \\boxed{16}$ such integers."
