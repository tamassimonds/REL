    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem one step at a time. \n\n### First Impressions and Brainstorming:\n\n- Ok, so we're dealing with an ant walking on a hexagon and moving from one vertex to an adjacent one. The problem asks for the probability that the ant is on the same vertex after 15 steps.\n- This problem reminds me of a concept in probability known as \"random walks,\" which I've encountered in a grid or linear paths before but not specifically on a hexagon.\n- The ant can start at any vertex, and each vertex is connected to two others because it's a hexagon. I need to think about how the positions change after each move.\n\n### Strategies to Consider:\n\n1. **Enumerate All Possibilities:**\n   - One way is to list all possible paths for the ant, but this seems quite complex due to the high number of steps (15) and vertices (6). This exhaustive approach doesn't seem feasible due to combinatorial explosion.\n\n2. **Use of Symmetry:**\n   - Since a hexagon is symmetric, it might simplify calculations, however, this does not directly help with calculating exact probabilities without some stochastic method.\n\n3. **Recursive or Dynamic Programming Approach:**\n   - This seems promising. There\u2019s a recurrent nature in the problem since each step depends on the previous step. Could write down formulas for probabilities and compute them iteratively.\n\n4. **Matrix Representation:**\n   - Leveraging linear algebra might work. Using a transition matrix to represent the probabilities of moving from one vertex to another and then raising this matrix to the 15th power could give the final probabilities.\n\nI\u2019ll explore the recursive approach first, as it seems natural for handling sequence-based or step-by-step problems.\n\n### Recursive Approach Development:\n\n- Let's define a state \\( P(n, v) \\) where \\( n \\) is the number of steps left and \\( v \\) is the vertex number. \\( P(n, v) \\) represents the probability of being at vertex \\( v \\) after \\( n \\) moves starting from vertex \\( v_0 \\).\n- Initially: \\( P(0, v_0) = 1 \\) and \\( P(0, v) = 0 \\) for \\( v \\neq v_0 \\).\n\n#### Recursive Formula:\n\n- For \\( n > 0 \\), \\( P(n, v) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot P(n-1, \\text{adj1}(v)) + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot P(n-1, \\text{adj2}(v)) \\)\n  - Here adj1 and adj2 are the adjacent vertices for \\( v \\).\n- This tells us the probability of being at vertex \\( v \\) after \\( n \\) steps is the average of the probabilities at its adjacent vertices after \\( n-1 \\) steps.\n\n### Matrix Approach:\n\nIf I feel like the recursive approach becomes too cumbersome, especially since \\( n = 15 \\), I could use matrix exponentiation instead.\n\n### Quick Check on Development:\n\n- The recursion seems solid, and aligns with random walk principles. Each vertex update correctly follows the adjacency and probability distribution.\n- I know from experience with such problems, symmetry can be leveraged, but it's not sufficiently simplifying this problem, mainly because of step-specific outcomes.\n\n### Refinement and Computation:\n\n1. Set up a dynamic programming table where each row represents a step and each column represents a vertex.\n2. Calculate \\( P(n, v) \\) up to \\( n = 15 \\).\n3. Verify intermediate steps for \\( n = 1, 2, 3 \\) to understand how the probabilities move.\n\nSecondary Approach: If arriving at the recursion solution leads to cumbersome calculations:\n- Setup the transition matrix \\( T \\) for the hexagon. For a starting vertex \\( v_0 \\), compute \\( (T^{15})_{v_0, v_0} \\).\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- After setting it up and calculating using either method, if getting the probability seems questionable, reevaluate the basis (like start vertices assumptions or number of steps correctness).\n- For confidence, compare the matrix exponentiation result as a verification against the recursive probability calculated for symmetry.\n\nWith all this, let\u2019s calculate and conclude accurately! Engage in computations on a separate sheet, ensure debugging for minor miscalculations, and verify correctness multiple times to be sure.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial approach. Let me go back and re-evaluate the problem with a fresh perspective.\n\n### Reevaluation of the Problem:\n\nThe task is to calculate the probability that an ant returns to its original starting vertex after 15 steps on a hexagon. Initially, I went through possible complex solutions like recursive approaches and matrix exponentiation. However, let's analyze the constraints of the problem more carefully:\n\n### Initial Observations and Intuition:\n\n1. **Revisiting the Number of Steps:**\n   - The number 15 is odd. This should instantly trigger an inspection in problems involving cycles or returning to a starting point.\n\n2. **Structure of the Hexagon:**\n   - Since a hexagon has 6 vertices and is a cycle, any complete traversal around the hexagon involves an even number of moves or steps. \n\n3. **Path Symmetry and Movement:**\n   - An ant must move an even number of steps to complete a cycle and return to the starting point because each move changes the vertex. Specifically, each complete cycle (loop around the hexagon) involves 6 steps.\n\n### Analytical Deduction:\n\n1. **Parity Argument:**\n   - For the ant to return to its starting vertex, the paths must be symmetric, which will naturally lead to an even number of steps.\n   - An odd number of steps, such as 15, means the ant is one step away from completing a potential cycle or just over halfway around the hexagon. Thus, it's impossible for the ant to be at the starting vertex with an odd number of steps.\n\n2. **Verification with Simple Cases:**\n   - If checked for fewer steps, with any odd number of steps (like 1, 3, 5), the ant never ends back at the starting vertex. Conversely, even number of steps (like 2, 4, 6) could potentially allow a return.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven this understanding, it becomes clear that because 15 is odd, there is inherently no symmetry in step distribution that would allow the ant to return to its starting vertex. Thus, the probability that the ant is standing on the same vertex after 15 steps is:\n\nThe probability is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nReflecting on this, the clarity came from realizing the importance of parity (odd vs even) rather than diving into complex calculations. It's a valuable reminder of how crucial initial insights are before proceeding with complex approaches.",

  "ground_truth": "There are two ways in which the ant can return to his original vertex: either he can go part of the way around the hexagon and then retrace his steps, or he can go all the way around the hexagon. In the first case, the ant necessarily moves an even number of steps, because his total number of steps is twice the number of steps needed to get to the point at which he begins to retrace. In the second case, because a hexagon has an even number of vertices, the ant is again moving an even number of steps. Thus, he has no way to return to the vertex on which he began in an odd number of steps, so the probability is $\\boxed{0}$."
