    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem step-by-step. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\nWhen I first look at the problem \\( (1 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5) \\div 11 \\), I notice it's a combination of operations: multiplication, addition, and division. The order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) tells me to tackle the multiplication first, then the addition, followed by the division. The expression within the parentheses should be computed first, thanks to the order of operations rule.\n\n**Step-by-Step Exploration:**\n\n1. **Understand What \\(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5\\) Is:**\n   - My initial approach is to simplify the multiplication first.\n   - Let\u2019s calculate \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\).\n   - Next, \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n   - Then, \\(24 \\times 5 = 120\\).\n   - So, \\(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 120\\).\n\n2. **Adding 1 to the Result:**\n   - Now that we have the multiplication done, let\u2019s add 1 to it: \n   - \\(1 + 120 = 121\\).\n\n3. **Division by 11:**\n   - Now, we take the result from the addition and divide it by 11:\n   - \\(121 \\div 11\\).\n   - At this point, it\u2019s beneficial to quickly estimate or recall division facts:\n     - I remember that \\(11 \\times 11 = 121\\).\n   - Hence, \\(121 \\div 11 = 11\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?:** The calculations seem consistent and reasonable. Multiplication first ensured I wasn\u2019t prematurely assuming anything about the total size of the result. My division check\u2014knowing \\(11 \\times 11 = 121\\)\u2014confirms that the division was executed correctly.\n  \n- **Quick Sanity Check:** \n   - Multiplying 2 through 5 feels like manageable numbers.\n   - Adding one and dividing by 11 doesn\u2019t feel extreme.\n   - The overall size of the numbers matches typical arithmetic reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n- From everything put together, the solution to the expression \\( (1 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5) \\div 11 \\) is 11.\n\nThrough this step-by-step approach, accuracy was maintained by reflecting on each phase of the calculation, ensuring that each part adhered to the appropriate mathematics rules and principles.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we evaluate the expression in the parentheses. Since multiplication has precedence over addition, $1 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 1 + 120 = 121$. Our original expression evaluates to $(1 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5) \\div 11 = 121 \\div 11 = \\boxed{11}.$"
