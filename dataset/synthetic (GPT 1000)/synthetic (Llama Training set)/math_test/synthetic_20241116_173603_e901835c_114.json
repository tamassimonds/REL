    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\n- Okay, the question is asking for the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196. I've done something similar before with divisors, so I think I need to break down the number 196 into its prime factors.\n- This looks like a straightforward problem\u2014no trick question here. But first things first, let me double-check what a \"divisor\" is exactly. Right, it means any number that can be evenly divided into 196 with no remainder.\n\nBrainstorming strategies:\n\n- I suppose one way to do this is by direct inspection, but that seems inefficient given that 196 is not a small number.\n- Another option is trial division, testing smaller prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, etc., to find the prime factors.\n- Once I get the prime factorization, I can apply the divisor formula: if a number \\( n = p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{a_k} \\), the number of divisors is \\((a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\ldots (a_k + 1)\\).\n\nInitial calculations:\n\n- Let's start simple: Is 196 divisible by 2? Yes, because 196 is even. So, divide 196 by 2:\n  \\[\n  196 \\div 2 = 98\n  \\]\n- 98 is also even, so it should also be divisible by 2:\n  \\[\n  98 \\div 2 = 49\n  \\]\n- 49 is not even, so time to try another prime number. Oh, I recognize 49! It's \\(7^2\\). So actually, 49 is \\(7 \\times 7\\).\n\nLet's verify the prime factorization so far:\n\n- Should rewrite 196 now: \\(196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nReflecting on correctness:\n\n- That seems correct. Let's quickly check: \\(2^2 = 4\\) and \\(7^2 = 49\\). Multiply them together to confirm:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 49 = 196\n  \\]\n- Yep, everything checks out!\n\nNext step\u2014finding the number of divisors:\n\n- With the prime factorization in \\( n = p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\), use the formula: \\((a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\\).\n- Here, \\(a_1 = 2\\) for the factor of 2, and \\(a_2 = 2\\) for the factor of 7.\n- So, calculate:\n  \\[\n  (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n  \\]\n\nFinal verification:\n\n- Does this make sense? Could 196 really have 9 divisors? Let's list them to be sure:\n  1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. \n- Yes, indeed, those are the 9 positive divisors.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- The number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is 9. Everything checks out and follows logically from the initial breakdown, and I feel confident in this solution!",

  "ground_truth": "First prime factorize $196=2^2\\cdot7^2$.  The prime factorization of any divisor of 196 cannot include any primes other than 2 and 7.  We are free to choose either 0, 1, or 2 as the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of a divisor of 196.  Similarly, we may choose 0, 1, or 2 as the exponent of 7.  In total, there are $3\\times 3=9$ possibilities for the prime factorization of a divisor of 196.  Distinct prime factorizations correspond to distinct integers, so there are $\\boxed{9}$ divisors of 196."
