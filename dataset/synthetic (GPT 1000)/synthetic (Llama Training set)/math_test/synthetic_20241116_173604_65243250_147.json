    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nI see that we're dealing with a problem where we're drawing 3 balls from a bin of 12. Each ball is numbered differently from 1 to 12. Drawing in order and allowing for replacement for the first draw but not for the second introduces some interesting dynamics to account for. Here\u2019s what initially comes to mind:\n\n1. With replacement after the first draw means the number of possible outcomes won't reduce immediately.\n2. The second ball is not replaced, which will impact the number of options for the third draw.\n3. The fact that draws are done in order (meaning that, say, drawing ball 3 then ball 5 is different from ball 5 then ball 3) means order matters, so undoubtedly, the permutation concept is relevant here. \n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Sequence of Draws**\n\n- **Draw 1:** We randomly pick a ball. Since it is replaced afterward, we have 12 options for this draw.\n  \n- **Draw 2:** We pick another ball, but this time, this ball is NOT replaced. This means, while we again have 12 choices initially, the subsequent draw will be influenced because this ball is not returned.\n\n- **Draw 3:** Here, we can draw any ball except for the one drawn in Draw 2, since it's kept outside. This limits us to 11 options (12 total minus the one ball kept outside).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Possible Outcomes**\n\n- For the **first ball**: there are 12 possibilities.\n- For the **second ball**: again, 12 possibilities because it's drawn after the first is replaced.\n- For the **third ball**: since the second ball is not replaced, there are only 11 possibilities.\n\nSo, the calculation of the total number of ways to draw these 3 balls in this particular situation would be:\n\\[ \n12 \\times 12 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s calculate this:\n\\[\n12 \\times 12 = 144\n\\]\n\\[\n144 \\times 11 = 1584\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Reflect on the Solution**\n\n- Have I accurately considered the condition that the sequence of draw is important? Yes, we are using permutations here since each sequence is considered unique.\n- Did I correctly apply the process condition (replacement after the first draw but not after the second)? Yes, my calculation takes this into account.\n- The logic follows because the constraints of replacing only the first ball but not the second are definitely respected.\n\nChecking this setup, everything seems consistent with the given conditions and makes sense logically.\n\nThe answer is **1584** unique ways to draw three balls under these conditions. \n\nI\u2019m confident about this solution after checking each step and revisiting the constraints provided in the problem!",
