    "working_out": "**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem involves evaluating the ceiling function of a negative fraction, specifically \\(\\left\\lceil -\\frac{7}{4} \\right\\rceil\\). The ceiling function, \\(\\lceil x \\rceil\\), gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(x\\). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of \\(-\\frac{7}{4}\\). It does seem a little tricky because it's negative. So my primary focus is around understanding how the ceiling function works for negative numbers. I vaguely remember it behaving somewhat counterintuitively when compared with positive numbers. \n\nHere's my initial plan:\n\n1. Convert the fraction into a decimal, since it's easier to visualize and compare with integers.\n2. Determine the ceiling using the understanding that for negative values, the ceiling function might act differently compared to how it does with positive values.\n3. Reflect and verify whether the computed ceiling is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given fraction.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n**Step 1: Convert the Fraction**\n\n- First, convert \\(-\\frac{7}{4}\\) into a decimal to get a clearer idea of where it lies on the number line.\n- So, \\(-\\frac{7}{4} = -1.75\\).\n\n**Step 2: Applying the Ceiling Function**\n\n- Now, consider \\(-1.75\\) with regard to the ceiling function, \\(\\lceil -1.75 \\rceil\\).\n- Intuitively, for positive numbers like 1.75, the ceiling would bump it up to 2. However, since this is \\(-1.75\\), I need to remember that the negative sign changes things.\n\n**Idea: Quick Check with Examples**\n\n- Normally, the ceiling brings the number up to the nearest integer above it.\n- But for negative numbers, we should think of it as moving up towards zero. \n\nLet me test this mentality quickly using a simpler example:\n- \\(\\lceil -1.3 \\rceil = -1\\) because it's the smallest integer **more positive** than \\(-1.3\\), and not \\(-2\\).\n\n**Step 3: Apply The Same Logic Here**\n\n- So, applying this logic to \\(-1.75\\):\n- The smallest integer that is greater than \\(-1.75\\) is \\(-1\\).\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- Is \\(-1\\) greater than or equal to \\(-1.75\\)? Yes, \\(-1 > -1.75\\).\n- Is there any integer smaller in value that is still greater than or equal to \\(-1.75\\)? No, \\(-2\\) and less are not greater than \\(-1.75\\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nReflecting on these steps taken, I feel confident the answer is correct. The function took \\(-1.75\\) and correctly identified \\(-1\\) as the ceiling based on how ceilings work with negative numbers. This seems to be the answer I was aiming for.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-1}\n\\]",
