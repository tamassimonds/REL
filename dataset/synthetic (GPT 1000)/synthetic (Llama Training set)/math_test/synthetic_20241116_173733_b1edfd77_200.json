    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step:\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n\nThe problem is asking for the arithmetic mean of the median and the mode from a stem-and-leaf plot. This seems straightforward, but I need to make sure I understand how these measures work with this kind of data representation. \n\nA stem-and-leaf plot is a way of displaying data where the stem represents the first part of a number and the leaves represent the latter parts. It seems similar to problems involving lists of numbers, but I have to convert this plot into a list format to work with it comfortably.\n\n### Step 1: Convert the Stem-and-Leaf Plot into a List\n\nI think the best way to tackle this is to first transform the stem-and-leaf plot into an ordered list of all the numbers. This will help in calculating both the mode and the median.\n- For \"4 | 1\", I get: 41\n- For \"5 | 2\", I get: 52\n- For \"6 | 7, 8, 8\", I get: 67, 68, 68\n- For \"7 | 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 6, 8\", I get: 71, 71, 72, 73, 73, 73, 75, 76, 78\n- For \"8 | 0, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8\", I get: 80, 84, 84, 86, 86, 86, 86, 88\n- For \"9 | 1, 3, 5, 5, 7\", I get: 91, 93, 95, 95, 97\n\nCombining these, I create the list: \n\\[ 41, 52, 67, 68, 68, 71, 71, 72, 73, 73, 73, 75, 76, 78, 80, 84, 84, 86, 86, 86, 86, 88, 91, 93, 95, 95, 97 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Median \n\nThe median is the middle value of a data set ordered from smallest to largest. Since I have listed the data set, I can count the number of data points:\n\nThere are 27 numbers in this list. When I visually inspect or count them, I find that the middle number is the 14th when ordered, which turns out to be 76. \n\n\\[ \\frac{27 + 1}{2} = 14 \\]\n\nSo, the median is 76.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Mode \n\nThe mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set. Glancing over the list, 86 appears four times, which seems to be the highest frequency.\n\nJust to verify:\n- 86 appears 4 times\n- 73 appears 3 times\n- Others appear less frequently\n\nHence, the mode is 86.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Arithmetic Mean of the Median and the Mode \n\nFinally, I need to find the mean of the two values I calculated: the median (76) and the mode (86).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Arithmetic Mean} = \\frac{76 + 86}{2} = \\frac{162}{2} = 81\n\\]\n\n### Final Reflection:\n\nI've converted the plot into a list, calculated the median and the mode accurately, double-checked my counts and frequencies. The arithmetic mean of the median and mode appears to be correct as I've gone through each part step by step.\n\nThus, the arithmetic mean of the median and the mode of this data set is **81**. \n\nThis method seems solid based on the steps I've taken and the checks I\u2019ve done along the way. I'm confident in the solution!\n\nAh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculations. Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure we're on the right track.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Median\n\nIn my earlier response, I found the median incorrectly. Let's double-check this. We have 27 grades in total. Therefore, the position of the median is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Median Position} = \\frac{27 + 1}{2} = 14 \\]\n\nEarlier, I recorded the 14th number as 76. However, upon revisiting the ordered list, the 14th grade is actually 78. This was an oversight on my part when listing the numbers. Reading across the rows of the stem-and-leaf plot accurately, the 14th entry is indeed 78.\n\n### Verifying the Mode\n\nFor the mode, I previously identified 86 as occurring four times, which is correct. This remains unchanged since it is indeed the most frequent grade in the list.\n\n### Re-calculating the Arithmetic Mean\n\nNow, I will re-calculate the arithmetic mean using the correct median and mode values:\n\n- **Correct Median**: 78\n- **Mode**: 86\n\nLet's find the arithmetic mean:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Arithmetic Mean} = \\frac{78 + 86}{2} = \\frac{164}{2} = 82\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nMy previous mistake was identifying the wrong median value due to an oversight in counting the ordered list. This time, by meticulously re-reading the list formed from the stem-and-leaf plot, I corrected the error. With the correct median of 78 and the mode of 86, the accurate arithmetic mean of these values is indeed 82.\n\nThus, the arithmetic mean of the median and the mode of this data set is **82**. I appreciate the opportunity to correct this mistake and reaffirm my understanding of the problem-solving process.",

  "ground_truth": "Each digit to the right of the vertical bar represents (the units digit of) one exam grade. Counting the digits, we see that there are $27$ exam grades in all. Thus, the $14^{\\rm th}$ grade in increasing order is the median (since there are $13$ grades smaller than it and $13$ grades larger than it). The chart makes it easy to read off the grades in increasing order -- we just read across the rows, from top to bottom. The $14^{\\rm th}$ entry is $78,$ so that's the median grade.\n\nThe mode is the most frequently occurring grade. In this case, it's $86,$ which appears four times in the chart.\n\nThe arithmetic mean of the median and mode of the data is $\\dfrac{1}{2}(78+86),$ or $\\boxed{82}.$"
