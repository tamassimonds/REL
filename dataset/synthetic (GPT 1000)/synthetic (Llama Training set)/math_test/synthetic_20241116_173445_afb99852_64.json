    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n**First Impression and Understanding the Problem:**\n\nMy initial thought is that this problem involves a geometric series, and the terms given are in base-2 (binary). The series appears to follow an alternating sign pattern, which is intriguing. It's a series decreasing in size\u2014similar to a converging geometric series. My approach would involve converting the series to base-10 for manipulation because that is what I am used to working with. \n\n**Brainstorming Approach:**\n\n1. **Step 1: Convert the first few terms from binary to base-10.** \n2. **Step 2: Identify a pattern (if any) in base-10.**\n3. **Step 3: Check if it's a geometric series in base-10 terms.**\n4. **Step 4: Find the sum of an infinite geometric series formula.** \n5. **Step 5: Convert the final result to a fraction, expressing both parts in base-10.**\n\nLet's start implementing this step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Convert the Series Terms to Base-10**\n\n1. The first term: \\( 0.1_2 \\) converts to decimal as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n2. The second term: \\( 0.01_2 \\) converts to decimal as \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n3. The third term: \\( 0.001_2 \\) converts to decimal as \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n4. The fourth term: \\( 0.0001_2 \\) converts to decimal as \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\).\n5. The fifth term: \\( 0.00001_2 \\) converts to decimal as \\( \\frac{1}{32} \\).\n\nLet me reflect: by converting the series, I observe that the denominators are powers of 2, confirming that it is a geometric series. And the series alternates in sign, which is another thing to note for setting up the series sum later.\n\n**Step 2: Pattern and Series Identification**\n\nThe converted series in decimal form: \n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} + \\ldots \\]\n\nI notice this is indeed a geometric series. The first term \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\) and the common ratio \\( r = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) (since it alternates in sign).\n\n\"Ah! This reminds me of the sum formula for an infinite geometric series!\"\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Sum of the Series**\n\nThe formula to sum an infinite geometric series is:\n\\[ S = \\frac{a}{1-r} \\]\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\\[ S = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1 - (-\\frac{1}{2})} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{2}} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Expression**\n\nWait, let\u2019s carefully simplify this: \n\\[ S = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\n**Step 5: Final Verification and Converting to Fraction**\n\nLet's ensure everything checks out\u2014this seems reasonable.\n\n- Verify the geometric progression: We started with \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\); each term is multiplied by \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Yes, it holds.\n- This sums up according to the formula. No errors in arithmetic.\n- Given the setup of the series, the final answer is verified as \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nReflecting back: by converting each step carefully and applying known geometric principles, the answer makes sense logically and numerically. \n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe sum of the series is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\\) in base-10, represented as a simple fraction.",

  "ground_truth": "Places to the right of the decimal point represent negative powers of the base, so we notice that the series in base 10 is $2^{-1}-2^{-2}+2^{-3}\\ldots=\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{8}\\ldots$. We recognize this as a geometric series with a common ratio of $-\\frac{1}{2}$ and apply the formula $\\frac{a}{1-r}$ for the sum of a geometric series with first term $a$ and common ratio $r$. We get $$\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1-\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{2}}=\\frac{1}{3}.$$So, the sum of the geometric series is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
