    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're looking for the coefficient of \\(x^3\\) in the product of two polynomials. Let's treat this systematically.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nMy very first thought is that multiplying two polynomials involves distributing each term in one polynomial over each term in the other polynomial (like a fully expanded version of FOIL for binomials). We need to pay attention to which pairs of terms, when multiplied, will result in terms involving \\(x^3\\).\n\nThinking about that seems familiar. I remember doing this with binomials where we used the distributive property. With larger polynomials, it\u2019s just more distributes, but the concept remains the same.\n\n### Strategy\n\n#### Strategy Brainstorm\n1. **Direct Multiplication**: Fully expand both polynomials and combine like terms, specifically picking out the \\(x^3\\) terms from the process.\n2. **Targeted Multiplication**: Only multiply terms that result in an \\(x^3\\) term. This seems strategic because we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(x^3\\).\n3. **Use Polynomial Division or Another Simplification Method**: Seems unnecessary at first glance for finding specific terms.\n\nLet me think... I\u2019ll try the **Targeted Multiplication** approach first. It feels more efficient because I don\u2019t really need all terms, just those contributing to \\(x^3\\).\n\n### Approach\n\n#### Finding Relevant Terms\n\n1. **Identify the Term Combinations That Give \\(x^3\\):**\n\n   - From \\(24x^4\\): Multiplied with \\(x^{-1}\\) term from the second polynomial, but there is not such a term, so contribute nothing here.\n  \n   - From \\(6x^3\\): Multiply with constant term from the second polynomial \\((4)\\) gives \\(6x^3 \\cdot 4 = 24x^3\\).\n  \n   - From \\(4x^2\\): Multiply with \\(x\\) term from the second polynomial \\((3x)\\) gives \\(4x^2 \\cdot 3x = 12x^3\\).\n  \n   - From \\(-7x\\): Multiply with \\(x^2\\) term from the second polynomial \\((3x^2)\\) gives \\(-7x \\cdot 3x^2 = -21x^3\\).\n  \n   - From \\(-5\\): Multiply with \\(x^3\\) term from the second polynomial \\((6x^3)\\) gives \\(-5 \\cdot 6x^3 = -30x^3\\).\n\nEach combination I\u2019ve found results in an \\(x^3\\) term. Let\u2019s sum them up.\n\n### Calculation\n\nAdding up the coefficients:\n- \\(24x^3\\) from \\(6x^3 \\cdot 4\\)\n- \\(12x^3\\) from \\(4x^2 \\cdot 3x\\)\n- \\(-21x^3\\) from \\(-7x \\cdot 3x^2\\)\n- \\(-30x^3\\) from \\(-5 \\cdot 6x^3\\)\n\nTotal coefficient of \\(x^3\\): \n\\[\n24 + 12 - 21 - 30 = -15\n\\]\n\n### Reflection and Verification\n\nQuick check: Let\u2019s reevaluate each multiplication to make sure I haven\u2019t slipped up anywhere.\n- \\(6x^3 \\cdot 4 = 24x^3\\) \u2714\n- \\(4x^2 \\cdot 3x = 12x^3\\) \u2714\n- \\(-7x \\cdot 3x^2 = -21x^3\\) \u2714\n- \\(-5 \\cdot 6x^3 = -30x^3\\) \u2714\n\nEverything checks out correctly. Arriving at \\(-15\\) seems consistent with steps taken, as well as logic.\n\nSo the final coefficient of \\(x^3\\) is \\(\\boxed{-15}\\). Feels right and each step logically follows through the targeted approach.",
