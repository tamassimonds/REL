    "working_out": "Certainly! Let\u2019s tackle this problem just like I would if I were thinking through it in real time.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nOkay, we're dealing with a percentage increase problem here. The enrollment at Liberty Middle School increased to 598 students, which is 4% more than last year. We're asked to find out what the enrollment was last year.\n\nThe first thought that comes to mind is that this is a common type of problem involving percentage increases. I remember solving similar problems where I needed to express the relationships in terms of equations. But, just to be sure, I'll brainstorm a few different approaches before diving into calculations.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Direct Algebraic Method:**\n   - We can use the formula for percentage increase, which is:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{New Value} = \\text{Old Value} \\times (1 + \\text{Percentage Increase})\n     \\]\n   - With this formula, \\(598 = \\text{Previous Enrollment} \\times 1.04\\).\n\n2. **Reverse Percentage Calculation:**\n   - Another way is to think of the 598 students as representing 104% of the last year's enrollment.\n   - To find what 100% was, we could divide by 1.04.\n\n3. **Proportional Reasoning:**\n   - Conceptualize that the increase is such that the school has an additional 4% more than last year's enrollment. Therefore, finding what 4% corresponds to what number and ensuring the rest corresponds correctly to last year's numbers.\n\nIt seems like the direct algebraic method might be the easiest one to start with. But if I run into any hiccups, I'll consider the others.\n\n### Using the Direct Algebraic Method\n\nI will proceed with the equation I mentioned earlier:\n\\[\n598 = \\text{Previous Enrollment} \\times 1.04\n\\]\n\nStopping for a second\u2014this equation makes sense because it reflects the situation described: 598 being a 4% increase over last year\u2019s numbers.\n\n#### Solving the Equation\n\nTo find the Previous Enrollment, I divide both sides of the equation by 1.04:\n\\[\n\\text{Previous Enrollment} = \\frac{598}{1.04}\n\\]\n\nLet me quickly do the calculation:\n\\[\n\\frac{598}{1.04} = 575\n\\]\n\n### Quick Check and Reflection\n\nThis seems right, as dividing 598 by 1.04 would logically yield a number smaller than 598 (which aligns with expecting the previous number before an increase).\n\nLet's verify by checking:\n- Last year was 575 students.\n- An increase of 4% leads to an addition of \\(575 \\times 0.04 = 23\\).\n- Add the increase: \\(575 + 23 = 598\\).\n\nYes, everything aligns correctly! My approach seems sound, and checking confirms the steps are correctly followed.\n\n### Concluding Notes\n\nIn the end, last year's enrollment was 575 students. This matches my expectations and confirms the accurate handling of percentages. If I were to encounter a similar problem in the future, I'd lean towards using the algebraic method again\u2014it proved direct and effective!",

  "ground_truth": "If we knew last year's enrollment at Liberty Middle School, we would multiply by $1.04$ to get the new enrollment of $598$ students. Working backward, we can divide $598$ by $1.04$ to get $\\boxed{575\\text{ students}}$. Alternatively, we could solve the equation $x + 0.04x = 598$, where $x$ is last year's enrollment."
