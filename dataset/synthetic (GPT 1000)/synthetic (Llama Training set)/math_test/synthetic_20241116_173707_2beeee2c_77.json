    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into simplifying the fraction \\(\\frac{24}{36}\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nThe problem asks to simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{24}{36}\\). At first glance, this looks like a classic case of reducing a fraction to its simplest form. I remember from previous math problems that this usually involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. By dividing both parts of the fraction by their GCD, we can simplify it.\n\nHowever, before I jump in, I want to brainstorm any other potential methods that might be useful:\n\n- **Prime Factorization:** Break down both numbers into their prime factors and cancel shared factors.\n- **Successive Division:** Start dividing both the numerator and denominator by common small prime numbers (like 2 or 3) until they can\u2019t be divided further.\n\nBoth methods seem viable; I\u2019ll start with prime factorization, as it provides a clear visual breakdown.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization\n\nLet's factor both the numerator and the denominator into their prime factors.\n\n- **24**: Here\u2019s what comes to mind:\n  - 24 is even, so divide by 2: \\(24 \\div 2 = 12\\)\n  - 12 is even, so divide by 2: \\(12 \\div 2 = 6\\)\n  - 6 is even, so divide by 2: \\(6 \\div 2 = 3\\)\n  - Finally, 3 is a prime number.\n\n  So, \\(24 = 2^3 \\times 3\\).\n\n- **36**: \n  - 36 is even, so divide by 2: \\(36 \\div 2 = 18\\)\n  - 18 is even, so divide by 2: \\(18 \\div 2 = 9\\)\n  - 9 can be divided by 3: \\(9 \\div 3 = 3\\)\n  - 3 is a prime number.\n\n  So, \\(36 = 2^2 \\times 3^2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Simplify by Canceling Common Factors \n\nLooking at:\n\n- \\(24 = 2^3 \\times 3\\)\n- \\(36 = 2^2 \\times 3^2\\)\n\nWe notice both have powers of 2 and 3. The shared factors are:\n- \\(2^2\\): As both have at least \\(2^2\\)\n- \\(3^1\\): As both have at least one factor of 3\n\nCanceling these out:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{24}{36} = \\frac{2^3 \\times 3}{2^2 \\times 3^2} = \\frac{2^{3-2} \\times 3^{1-1}}{3^{2-1}} = \\frac{2^1}{3^1} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Verification\n\nNow that \\(\\frac{24}{36} = \\frac{2}{3}\\), let's quickly verify the solution:\n\nThinking out loud: \"If I expand \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) by multiplying both sides by 12 (backwards from simplification):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{12}{12} = \\frac{24}{36}\n\\]\n\nSeems correct! The math checks out. Now that backward testing reassures that \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) is indeed the simplest form.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy using prime factorization and verifying by scaling it back up, the fraction \\(\\frac{24}{36}\\) simplifies cleanly to \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Reflecting on the process, it seemed like a straightforward problem but sometimes taking multiple approaches can lead to more confidence in the final answer. It feels good to know the simplification makes sense logically and matches mathematically.",
