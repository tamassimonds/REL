    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle the problem of finding the smallest multiple of \\(5\\) that is greater than \\(-32\\). I'll start by brainstorming and exploring a few different strategies to approach this.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\nWhen I first read this, I think about multiples of \\(5\\). They are numbers like \\( \\ldots, -25, -20, -15, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, \\ldots \\). I need to focus on the negatives initially and think about their sequence.\n\nTypically, we might list some negative multiples of \\(5\\) and then see which is greater than \\(-32\\). \n\n### Strategy 1: Listing Negative Multiples\nListed backwards from zero, the negative multiples of \\(5\\) are:\n- \\(0, -5, -10, -15, -20, -25, -30, -35, -40, \\ldots\\)\n\nSo my thought is to list a few and see which is the smallest number greater than \\(-32\\). I\u2019ve gone up to \\(-30\\) and beyond. So now let's reflect: based on the list, \\(-30\\) immediately stands out because:\n- \\(-30\\) is greater than \\(-32\\)\n- It's the first multiple of \\(5\\) I've listed that meets this criterion.\n\nI think this should be it, but there's no harm in verifying. Let's double-check this by considering the mathematics of multiples.\n\n### Strategy 2: Using Algebra/Arithmetic\nIf a number \\(n\\) is a multiple of \\(5\\), it can be expressed as \\( n = 5k \\) where \\(k\\) is an integer.\n\nWe need \\(n > -32\\). So, if \\(n = 5k\\), then:\n\\[ 5k > -32 \\]\n\nDividing every part by \\(5\\),\n\\[ k > \\frac{-32}{5} \\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\frac{-32}{5} = -6.4\\). Okay, let's slow down and think: \n\nSince \\(k\\) must be an integer and greater than \\(-6.4\\), the smallest integer \\(k\\) that\u2019s greater than \\(-6.4\\) is \\(-6\\).\n\nPlugging back into the expression \\( n = 5k \\):\n\\[ n = 5 \\times (-6) = -30 \\]\n\nThis confirms our earlier result from listing, so \\(-30\\) indeed is the smallest multiple of \\(5\\) greater than \\(-32\\).\n\n### Final Reflection:\nHmm, let's see. We've used the listing approach and validated it through direct calculation, and both point to \\(-30\\) as our answer. Everything checks out, and there's coherence across different methods. It feels satisfying to see the problem resolved this way. \n\nTherefore, the smallest multiple of \\(5\\) which is greater than \\(-32\\) is \\(-30\\).\n\nOverall, I think this iterative process worked well, trying a few methods out loud and verifying through another thought process. It\u2019s always good to reassess and confirm calculations when working through a problem like this.",

  "ground_truth": "Dividing $-32$ by $5$ gives $-6$ with a remainder of $-2$, or $$-32 = -6 \\cdot 5 - 2.$$Thus, $-6 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{-30}$ is the smallest multiple of $5$ that is greater than $-32$."
