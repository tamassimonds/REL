    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I'll try to think through this problem naturally as if I were solving it right now. Here we go.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst, let's make sure we truly understand what this problem is asking. The mean of four distinct positive integers is 5, and we have been given that the largest one is 13. Our task is to find the smallest of these integers.\n\nWhen I see something like this, I immediately think about what the constraints are: mean and distinct integers. \"Mean\" means average, and the numbers must be distinct, meaning no two numbers can be the same. I'm trying to see if there are any quick options or shortcuts here before resorting to purely algebraic method.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Sum\nIf the mean (average) of four numbers is 5, then their total sum must be 4 times 5, since the mean is total sum divided by number of items.\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Sum} = 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\]\n\nThis feels right because that's how the average works, summing them up and dividing by the count gives you mean. I double-check this logic quickly in my head \u2013 yes, if you redistribute 20 over 4 items evenly, you get 5.\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Range of Values\nWith the largest number being 13 and the sum being 20, I need to think about what the other numbers could be. Taking this a bit further \u2013 if the largest is 13, then the sum of the other three numbers is:\n\n\\[ 20 - 13 = 7 \\]\n\nSo, I have three distinct integers that add up to 7. At this moment, I pause because I realize the constraint of \"distinct\". This feels like a mini-puzzle. We need them to be the lowest possible numbers because we want the smallest number.\n\n### Step 4: Trial and Error with Constraints\nGiven that these three numbers must be positive and distinct, they start from 1 and go upwards. Let\u2019s brainstorm combinations:\n\n- 1, 2, and 4: This sums up to 7.\n\nQuick check: if I take 1, 2, and 4, it fits perfectly with them being distinct and less than 13. The sum 1 + 2 + 4 is indeed 7.\n\nBut let's reflect a second: Did I miss any obvious other sets here?\n\n- Can I try any other small numbers? A random check like 1, 3, 3 or similar wouldn't work since they need to be distinct.\n- I think 1, 2, 4 is perhaps the smallest set of distinct numbers starting from as low as possible.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Solution\nI should check now if it fits all constraints:\n\n- Are all numbers positive? Yes.\n- Are they distinct? Yes, 1, 2, and 4 are all different.\n- Do they sum correctly to 7 when the largest is 13? Yes.\n\nIt all fits perfectly. This is likely our correct set, and the smallest integer here is 1.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe smallest of the four integers is 1. \n\nReflecting on this, everything seems consistent with the problem conditions, and there doesn't seem to be any other set of smaller distinct integers that fit the requirement.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the four distinct positive integers be $a$, $b$, $c$, and 13, with $a<b<c<13$. We have the equation $\\frac{a+b+c+13}{4}=5\\Rightarrow a+b+c=7$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be positive and distinct, $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=4$. So the smallest integer is $\\boxed{1}$."
