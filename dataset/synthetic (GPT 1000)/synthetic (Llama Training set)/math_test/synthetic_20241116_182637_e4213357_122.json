    "working_out": "Alright, let's begin by thoroughly understanding the problem. We need to simplify the expression \\(x^2 + 2x(5-x) + (5-x)^2\\). The goal is to find a simpler form or identify patterns by expanding and simplifying.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n- At first glance, this expression combines terms with \\(x\\) and constants. It might be helpful to expand these terms one by one.\n- I notice that the middle term, \\(2x(5-x)\\), might distribute in an interesting way.\n- The entire expression might simplify neatly once expanded. Expanding and combining like terms could be a promising start.\n\n### Step 1: Expanding Terms\nLet's tackle this by expanding each term separately:\n\n1. **Expand \\(x^2\\):** This term stays as it is since it's already in its simplest form.\n\n2. **Expand \\(2x(5-x)\\):**\n   - Distribute \\(2x\\) into \\(5 - x\\).\n   - \\[2x(5 - x) = 2x \\times 5 + 2x \\times (-x)\\]\n   - \\[= 10x - 2x^2\\]\n\n3. **Expand \\((5-x)^2\\):**\n   - Use the identity \\((a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\).\n   - Here, \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = x\\).\n   - \\[(5-x)^2 = 5^2 - 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot x + x^2\\]\n   - \\[= 25 - 10x + x^2\\]\n\n### Step 2: Combining All Terms\nNow we'll combine everything from the expansion:\n\n- Start with: \\(x^2 + 2x(5-x) + (5-x)^2\\).\n- From our expansions:\n  - \\(x^2\\)\n  - \\(10x - 2x^2\\)\n  - \\(25 - 10x + x^2\\)\n\n- Combine the expanded expressions:\n  \\[x^2 + (10x - 2x^2) + (25 - 10x + x^2)\\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplifying\nLet's combine like terms:\n\n- **\\(x^2\\) terms:**\n  - \\(x^2 + (-2x^2) + x^2 = 0\\)\n\n- **\\(x\\) terms:**\n  - \\(10x - 10x = 0\\)\n\n- **Constant term:**\n  - \\(25\\)\n\n### Reflection\n- So, after combining all terms, the expression \\(x^2 + 2x(5-x) + (5-x)^2\\) simplifies to \\(25\\).\n- This shows that no matter what real value \\(x\\) takes, the entire expression evaluates to 25.\n  \n### Final Verification\nLet's think about this result: since the \\(x\\) terms and \\(x^2\\) terms perfectly cancel out, leaving only a constant, it all makes sense mathematically. Let's check the individual arithmetic steps again to ensure every term cancelled out correctly, confirming that the process didn't have any overlooked mistakes. This reinforces our conclusion: indeed, the given expression simplifies to 25.\n\nIn summary, we've methodically expanded, simplified, and confirmed that \\(x^2 + 2x(5-x) + (5-x)^2 = 25\\) for any real number \\(x\\).",
