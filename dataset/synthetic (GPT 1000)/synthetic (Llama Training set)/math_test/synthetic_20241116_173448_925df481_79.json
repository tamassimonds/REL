    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem and think through it step by step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- This problem seems to involve proportions or similar triangles. I remember solving something like this in geometry class regarding shadows and heights using ratios.\n- Hmm, I'm guessing that the sunlight creates similar triangles with the woman and the tree since both cast shadows at the same time.\n- So, the ratio of the height to the shadow length should be the same for both the woman and the tree.\n\n### Exploration of Strategies\n\n1. **Ratio/Proportion Method**: Because the shadows are cast at the same time, the angles of inclination from the sun are the same for the woman and the tree. This creates similar triangles, meaning that the corresponding sides should be proportional.\n\n2. **Checking the Similar Triangles Concept**: I just need to verify that this idea of using triangles holds. Yes, since both the woman and the tree are under the same sunlight conditions, the triangles (formed by their heights and shadows) are definitely similar.\n\n3. **Mathematical Representation**: I can set up a proportion based on their heights and shadow lengths.\n\n### Calculations\n\n1. **Setting Up the Proportion**: \n   - Woman's height = 5 feet\n   - Woman's shadow = 8 feet\n   - Tree's shadow = 120 feet\n   - Let's call the height of the tree \\( h \\).\n\n   Proportion equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Woman's Height}}{\\text{Woman's Shadow}} = \\frac{\\text{Tree's Height}}{\\text{Tree's Shadow}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{h}{120}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solving for \\( h \\)**: \n   - I'll cross-multiply to solve for \\( h \\):\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 120 = 8 \\times h\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   600 = 8h\n   \\]\n\n3. **Dividing to Isolate \\( h \\)**:\n   - Divide both sides by 8:\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{600}{8} = 75\n   \\]\n\n### Quick Check\n\n- Hmm, let's quickly think if the final answer for the tree's height seems reasonable.\n- Since 75 feet is quite a tall tree but not peculiar for large trees, that seems okay.\n- I should check the calculations again to ensure no errors: 600 \u00f7 8 = 75 checks out. Yep, consistent.\n\n### Reflection\n\n- This approach using similar triangles seemed smooth and intuitive after considering the problem scenario.\n- The fact that these types of problems often involve proportions was a good anchor point.\n- I also appreciate how checking my calculations solidified the thought process, ensuring accuracy.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe tree is 75 feet tall.",

  "ground_truth": "The ratio of the height of an object to the length of its shadow is a constant at a given time of day.  Therefore,  \\[\n\\frac{5}{8}=\\frac{h}{120},\n\\]where $h$ is the height of the tree. Since $8\\times15=120$, $h=5\\times15=\\boxed{75}$ feet."
