    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it step-by-step.\n\nFirst thoughts: \n\n- I see we're dealing with a quadratic equation \\(2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0\\) and asked to find \\((d-1)(e-1)\\), where \\(d\\) and \\(e\\) are the roots. I recall from algebra that there are some interesting properties relating to roots of a quadratic equation and expressions involving those roots.\n\nDifferent strategies come to mind:\n\n1. **Direct Calculation of Roots using the Quadratic Formula:** I could directly calculate the roots using the quadratic formula. The formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) involves a bit of computation, but it's straightforward. This method gives me the exact roots, which I can then use to find \\((d-1)(e-1)\\).\n\n2. **Properties of Quadratic Roots:** There's also a clever use of Vieta's formulas. Vieta tells us that the sum and product of the roots are related to the coefficients of the quadratic. Specifically: \\(d+e = -\\frac{b}{a}\\) and \\(de = \\frac{c}{a}\\). This might help with the expression \\((d-1)(e-1)\\) by expanding and substituting these values.\n\n3. **Analysis through Factorization:** Sometimes, factoring the quadratic can be quicker if it's factorable. But glancing at the coefficients, it doesn't look like a simple factorization (like integers) would work here.\n\nI'm leaning towards using Vieta's formulas since they are elegant and reduce computation. But I'll keep the quadratic formula option open in case verification is needed.\n\nLet's explore using Vieta's first:\n\n- \\(d + e = -\\frac{3}{2}\\)\n- \\(de = -\\frac{5}{2}\\)\n\nNow, let's compute \\((d-1)(e-1)\\):\n\n1. Expand the expression \\((d-1)(e-1)\\):\n   \\[\n   (d-1)(e-1) = de - d - e + 1\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute the values from Vieta's formulas:\n   \\[\n   = \\left(-\\frac{5}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) + 1\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplify step-by-step:\n   - First substitute for \\(de\\): \\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\)\n   - Next substitute for \\((d + e)\\): \\(-\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n   - Remember the \"+1\" at the end\n\n   \\[\n   = -\\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} + 1\n   \\]\n\n4. Perform the arithmetic:\n   - \\(-\\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} = -1\\)\n   - \\(-1 + 1 = 0\\)\n\nSo, \\((d-1)(e-1) = 0\\).\n\nReflecting back:\n\n- The calculations seem clear; the expansion matches typical algebraic manipulations. Vieta's formulas greatly simplify our work. It's reassuring when the arithmetic fits together so neatly.\n  \n- Before finalizing, I consider any possible oversight\u2014subtraction signs or common calculation errors\u2014but everything holds through in this case.\n\nConclusion: The value of \\((d-1)(e-1)\\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
