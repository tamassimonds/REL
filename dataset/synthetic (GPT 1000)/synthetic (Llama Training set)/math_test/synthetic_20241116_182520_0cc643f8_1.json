    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\nI see this is an equation involving a linear expression. The equation appears to have a couple of terms with \\( x \\), and one additional expression that combines a constant and \\( x \\). My goal seems to be to simplify and solve for \\( x \\). I've done similar problems before, so I might use what I know about combining like terms and isolating variables.\n\nLet's lay out a potential approach:\n\n1. **Combine like terms.** Since the equation has multiple terms with \\( x \\), it might be helpful to gather them to simplify the expression.\n2. **Simplify the equation.** Once terms are combined, look at the equation to see if further simplification is needed.\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\).** Use algebraic methods to isolate \\( x \\).\n4. **Check the solution.** After finding \\( x \\), it's important to substitute it back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n\nStarting the process:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the equation\n\nThe equation is:\n\\[ 2x + \\frac{1}{2}x + 2(1 + x) = 29 \\]\n\nFirst, let's distribute the 2 across the parentheses:\n\\[ 2x + \\frac{1}{2}x + 2 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot x = 29 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 2x + \\frac{1}{2}x + 2 + 2x = 29 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Combine like terms\n\nNow combine the terms involving \\( x \\):\n\\[ (2x + 2x + \\frac{1}{2}x) + 2 = 29 \\]\n\nThis becomes:\n\\[ 4x + \\frac{1}{2}x + 2 = 29 \\]\n\nCombine \\( 4x \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{2}x \\):\nTo do this, let's think about the fraction: add \\( 4x \\) (which is \\(\\frac{8}{2}x\\) if it's useful to have the same denominator) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}x\\).\n\nSo:\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{8}{2}x + \\frac{1}{2}x\\right) + 2 = 29 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{2}x + 2 = 29 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Isolate \\( x \\)\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\\[ \\frac{9}{2}x = 27 \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( x \\) by multiplying both sides by \\(\\frac{2}{9}\\) to get rid of the fraction:\n\\[ x = 27 \\cdot \\frac{2}{9} \\]\n\nSimplify \\( 27 \\cdot \\frac{2}{9} \\):\n\\[ x = 27 \\cdot \\frac{2}{9} = 27 \\cdot \\frac{2}{9} = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Verify the solution\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 6 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it holds true:\n\\[ 2(6) + \\frac{1}{2}(6) + 2(1 + 6) = 29 \\]\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n- \\( 2(6) = 12 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{1}{2}(6) = 3 \\)\n- \\( 2(1 + 6) = 2(7) = 14 \\)\n\nAdd these together:\n\\[ 12 + 3 + 14 = 29 \\]\n\n29 equals 29, which is correct!\n\nFinal statement:\nThe value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( x = 6 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Collecting like terms on the left hand side gives $\\frac{9}{2}x+2=29$. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives $\\frac{9}{2}x=27$. Then, multiplying both sides by $\\frac{2}{9}$ gives $x=\\boxed{6}$."
