It tells us how many ways we can choose 82 items from 85 items.\n3. **Quick Observation:** \\(\\binom{85}{82} = \\binom{85}{3}\\). This is because choosing 82 items from 85 is equivalent to leaving out 3 items.\n\nHmm, the formula for a binomial coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n = 85\\) and \\(k = 82\\) (or 3, if considering less operations).\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n**Strategy 1: Direct Calculation**\n\nLet's try calculating \\(\\binom{85}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{85}{3} = \\frac{85!}{3! \\times (85-3)!} = \\frac{85 \\times 84 \\times 83}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\nExplaining why I chose this: Direct calculation for small \\(k\\) like 3 seems much easier as we avoid calculating large factorials. Alright, let's compute these values:\n\n- **Numerator:** \\(85 \\times 84 \\times 83\\)\n- **Denominator:** \\(3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n\nLet's calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[\n85 \\times 84 = 7140\n\\]\n\\[\n7140 \\times 83 = 592620\n\\]\n\nNow, divide by the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{592620}{6} = 98770\n\\]\n\n### Checking\n\n1. **Revisiting the Setup:** Did I set up the choose correctly? Yes, going with 3 is definitely right as it simplifies the calculation.\n2. **Re-evaluating the Arithmetic:** Quick double-check on the multiplication and division. Seems right\u2014no misplaced operations.\n3. **Reflection:** 98,770 feels reasonable given the numbers involved\u2014it's a large, but not astronomical, number, which matches expectations for combinations involving somewhat small numbers in subsets.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- After thorough examination, \\(\\binom{85}{82} = \\binom{85}{3} = 98,770\\).\n- Computing \\(\\binom{85}{82}\\) directly as \\(\\binom{85}{3}\\) proved efficient and verified the arithmetic was handled cleanly.\n\nAwesome, that clicks! I\u2019m feeling confident this approach and solution accurately reflects the problem\u2019s requirement.",
