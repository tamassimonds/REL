    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem, step by step, and really let my thinking flow naturally.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nThe given problem is: Given \\( x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} = 7 \\), we need to find the value of \\( x^4 + \\frac{1}{x^4} \\).\n\nFirst thoughts: This looks quite similar to problems I've seen before, where manipulating the given equation leads to the desired expression. I remember there's a relationship between these powers that can be exploited.\n\n### Initial Approach\n\n#### Step 1: Recalling Identities\n\nFirst, let's use the identity that relates these expressions:\n\\[ \n(x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2})^2 = x^4 + 2 + \\frac{1}{x^4}\n\\]\n\nOh, this is useful! Squaring the given equation should help us get closer to the \\( x^4 + \\frac{1}{x^4} \\) that we're looking for.\n\n#### Step 2: Applying the Identity\n\nLet's square the given equation:\n\n\\[ \n(x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2})^2 = (7)^2 \n\\]\n\nCalculating the right-hand side, we get:\n\n\\[ \n49 = x^4 + 2 + \\frac{1}{x^4}\n\\]\n\nThis means:\n\n\\[ \nx^4 + \\frac{1}{x^4} = 49 - 2 \n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ \nx^4 + \\frac{1}{x^4} = 47 \n\\]\n\nNice, this seems straightforward. I'll just take a moment to reflect and check whether this makes sense.\n\n### Reflection\n\n- The steps followed a logical path from the given information to the target expression.\n- The algebraic manipulation using the identity was correctly employed.\n- Calculations seem accurate.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe value of \\( x^4 + \\frac{1}{x^4} \\) is \\( \\boxed{47} \\).\n\nWell, that was a smooth progression. Each step felt correct, and the use of the identities made the process quite elegant. Let me know if any part needs more exploration or another approach!",
