    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem of factoring the expression \\(7x^3 - 21x^2 + 14x\\) step by step.\n\nWhen I first look at this expression, I notice that it\u2019s a polynomial with three terms. My initial thought is, \"This looks similar to problems where I've factored out common terms before. Let's see if there's a common factor.\"\n\n**Step 1: Look for Common Factors**\n\nFirst, I need to examine each term: \\(7x^3\\), \\(-21x^2\\), and \\(14x\\). What initially comes to mind is: I should list out the coefficients and variables separately:\n\n- Coefficients are 7, -21, and 14. \n- Variables are \\(x^3\\), \\(x^2\\), and \\(x\\).\n\nI notice all these coefficients are divisible by 7. Let\u2019s confirm it:\n\n- 7 divides 7 (obviously),\n- 7 divides 21,\n- 7 divides 14.\n\nGreat, 7 is indeed a common factor. Now, look at the powers of \\(x\\). Each term also has \\(x\\), so \\(x\\) is a common factor too, but the lowest power of \\(x\\) present in all terms is \\(x\\) (as in the last term \\(14x\\)).\n\nThus, I can factor out \\(7x\\) from each term. My thought process: \"It's just like when I distribute, but backward.\"\n\n**Factoring out \\(7x\\):**\n\n\\[ 7x^3 - 21x^2 + 14x = 7x(x^2 - 3x + 2) \\]\n\nOh, interesting. I've managed to factor out \\(7x\\), leaving me with a simpler quadratic: \\(x^2 - 3x + 2\\).\n\n**Step 2: Factor the Quadratic Expression**\n\nNow, I have the quadratic \\(x^2 - 3x + 2\\) left to factor. Hmm, this looks like it could be factored into two binomials. So next, I need to think: \"Can this quadratic be split into two numbers that multiply to 2 (the constant term) and add to -3 (the coefficient of the \\(x\\) term)?\"\n\nLet\u2019s consider factors of 2. Well:\n\n- Factors of 2 are 1 and 2.\n\nI need the sum of two numbers to be -3.\n\n- \\((-1) + (-2) = -3\\)\n\nPerfect! This combination works.\n\n**Factoring the Quadratic:**\n\n\\[ x^2 - 3x + 2 = (x - 1)(x - 2) \\]\n\n**Step 3: Combine Everything**\n\nNow bring everything together because I factored out previously \\(7x\\):\n\n\\[ 7x(x - 1)(x - 2) \\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nI should pause here and quickly verify the factorization by expanding it back to see if it matches the original expression:\n\n\\[ \n7x(x - 1)(x - 2) = 7x((x - 1)(x - 2)) \n\\]\n\n\\[ \n= 7x(x^2 - 2x - x + 2) \n\\]\n\n\\[ \n= 7x(x^2 - 3x + 2) \n\\]\n\n\\[ \n= 7x^3 - 21x^2 + 14x \n\\]\n\nYes, it is correct! The final factored form represents the original expression. So, the complete correct factorization for \\(7x^3 - 21x^2 + 14x\\) is:\n\n\\[ 7x(x - 1)(x - 2) \\]\n\nThe steps have led us to see that factoring out common terms can simplify a polynomial, and then further factoring the result is useful. Feeling confident that this approach and solution accurately address the problem and is now fully factored.",

  "ground_truth": "Both 7 and $x$ are factors of each term, so we can factor out $7x$: \\[7x^3 -21x^2 + 14x = (7x)\\cdot(x^2) - (7x)\\cdot (3x) + (7x)\\cdot 2 = 7x(x^2 - 3x + 2).\\]We can factor $x^2 - 3x + 2$ into $(x-1)(x-2)$, to get our answer of $\\boxed{7x(x-1)(x-2)}$."
