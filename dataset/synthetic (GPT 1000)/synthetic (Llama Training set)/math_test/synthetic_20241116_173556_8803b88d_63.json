    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Hmm, okay. We have a true-false test with 100 questions.\n- The rules are split into two conditions: \n  - Every question that is a multiple of 4 is actually true.\n  - Every question the student marks as a multiple of 3, they mark false.\n- We need to find out how many answers the student correctly marks among these 100 questions.\n- This problem is about finding intersections between sets, I think. Sets defined by the multiples.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Sets**\n\n1. **Items that are multiples of 4**:\n   - These are: 4, 8, 12, ..., 100. \n   - They form an arithmetic sequence with the first term \\(a_1 = 4\\) and the common difference \\(d = 4\\).\n\n    Let's calculate how many terms there are:\n    \n    \\[\n    n = \\frac{100 - 4}{4} + 1 = 25\n    \\]\n\n    Okay, so there are 25 multiples of 4.\n\n2. **Items that are multiples of 3**:\n   - These are: 3, 6, 9, ..., 99.\n   - Again, an arithmetic sequence with first term \\(a_1 = 3\\) and common difference \\(d = 3\\).\n\n    Finding the number of terms:\n    \n    \\[\n    m = \\frac{99 - 3}{3} + 1 = 33\n    \\]\n\n    So, there are 33 multiples of 3.\n\n**Step 2: Finding Intersection (Multiples of 12)**\n\n- Now, for the items that are multiples of both 3 and 4, these would actually be multiples of 12 (the least common multiple of 3 and 4).\n- These multiples are: 12, 24, 36, ..., 96.\n\n    Let's calculate them:\n    \n    \\[\n    k = \\frac{96 - 12}{12} + 1 = 8\n    \\]\n\n    There are 8 multiples of 12.\n\n**Step 3: Determine Correct Answers**\n\nWe need to find how many items the student correctly marks:\n\n- **Mark Correctly True:** \n  - If it is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 12. \n  - There were 25 multiples of 4, and 8 were also multiples of 12, so the remainder: \n\n    \\[\n    25 - 8 = 17 \n    \\]\n\n- **Mark Correctly False:**\n  - If it is not a multiple of 4 and is a multiple of 3.\n  - There were 33 multiples of 3, and 8 were also multiples of 12, so the remainder:\n\n    \\[\n    33 - 8 = 25\n    \\]\n\n**Step 4: Summing the Correctly Answered Items**\n\n- Add the correctly marked true and false numbers:\n\n    \\[\n    17 \\ (\\text{correctly marked true}) + 25 \\ (\\text{correctly marked false}) = 42\n    \\]\n\nOkay, the number of items the student got correctly is 42. \n\nReflecting on this, it seems we've accurately dissected the sets involved and systematically calculated the intersections. Each calculation seems to fit logically, so I'm confident this is correct. Looks like we're done here!",

  "ground_truth": "The student will answer a question correctly if\n\nCase 1: both the student and the answer key say it is true. This happens when the answer is NOT a multiple of 3 but IS a multiple of 4.\n\nCase 2. both the student and the answer key say it is false. This happens when the answer IS a multiple of 3 but is NOT a multiple of 4.\n\nSince the LCM of 3 and 4 is 12, the divisibility of numbers (in our case, correctness of answers) will repeat in cycles of 12. In the first 12 integers, $4$ and $8$ satisfy Case 1 and $3,6,$ and $9$ satisfy Case 2, so for every group of 12, the student will get 5 right answers. Since there are 8 full groups of 12 in 100, the student will answer at least $8 \\cdot 5 = 40$ questions correctly. However, remember that we must also consider the leftover numbers 97, 98, 99, 100 and out of these, $99$ and $100$ satisfy one of the cases. So our final number of correct answers is $40 + 2 = \\boxed{42}$."
