    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: \n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe task is to determine which two consecutive integers the sum \\(\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50}\\) falls between on a number line. \n\nUpon reading it, the first thought is that this looks like a problem involving estimating the values of square roots and summing them. It seems like a combination of estimation and arithmetic skill. However, I'm not sure of the exact values of these square roots at the outset, so I'll begin by trying to estimate them.\n\n**Estimating \\(\\sqrt{30}\\):**\n\n1. First thoughts: I know that 30 is not a perfect square. The perfect squares nearest to 30 are 25 (\\(5^2\\)) and 36 (\\(6^2\\)). Therefore, I know:\n   \\[\n   5 < \\sqrt{30} < 6\n   \\]\n2. To improve this estimation, I will try a number between 5 and 6 to see if I get closer. Let's try 5.5:\n   \\[\n   5.5^2 = 30.25\n   \\]\n   Since \\(30.25\\) is slightly more than 30, \\(\\sqrt{30}\\) is less than 5.5 but not much less. Let's try 5.48:\n   \\[\n   5.48^2 = 30.0304\n   \\]\n   Closer! So let's refine further to estimate \\(\\sqrt{30} \\approx 5.48\\).\n\n**Estimating \\(\\sqrt{50}\\):**\n\n1. Similarly, consider around which integers the value falls. The perfect squares near 50 are 49 (\\(7^2\\)) and 64 (\\(8^2\\)). So:\n   \\[\n   7 < \\sqrt{50} < 8\n   \\]\n2. Again, let's refine using a middle number, say 7.1:\n   \\[\n   7.1^2 = 50.41\n   \\]\n   Since \\(50.41\\) is slightly more than 50, \\(\\sqrt{50}\\) is slightly less than 7.1. Let's try 7.07:\n   \\[\n   7.07^2 = 49.9849\n   \\]\n   This is quite close, so we can estimate \\(\\sqrt{50} \\approx 7.07\\).\n\n**Calculating the Sum:**\n\n1. Combining the estimates:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50} \\approx 5.48 + 7.07 = 12.55\n   \\]\n   \n**Checking for Consecutive Integers:**\n\n1. The task is to find which two consecutive integers \\(\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50}\\) is between. So we focus on our result:\n   \\[\n   12.55\n   \\]\n\n2. Observing \\(12.55\\), it is evident that the sum fits between 12 and 13 on the number line.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter reviewing the calculations and estimations, it's reasonable to conclude that \\(\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50}\\) is located between 12 and 13. The approach seems solid, as we've systematically estimated the square roots and then added them. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is: **12 and 13**.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $25<30<36$, we have $5<\\sqrt{30}<6$. We also know that $7^2=49$, so $\\sqrt{50}\\approx7$. As a result, $(5+7)<\\sqrt{30}+\\sqrt{50}<(6+7)$, so the sum is located between $\\boxed{12\\text{ and }13}$.\n\nTo be more precise, $\\sqrt{50}>7$, but we're still able to say that $\\sqrt{30}+\\sqrt{50}<(6+7)$ when we add a slightly greater quantity to the left side since the difference between $6$ and $\\sqrt{30}$ is much greater than the difference between $\\sqrt{50}$ and $7$."
