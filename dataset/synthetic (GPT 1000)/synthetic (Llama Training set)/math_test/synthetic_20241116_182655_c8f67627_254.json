    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were solving it physically. I'll try to methodically navigate through my thoughts and ideas, kind of like brainstorming on paper.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nOkay, so this is a problem about percentages, specifically about figuring out what percentage of Gina's socks are red. This seems fairly straightforward, but I want to break it down clearly. \n\n### Brainstorming Different Strategies\n- **Total Count:** Before I can calculate the percentage, I need to know the total number of socks.\n- **Fraction of Red Socks:** Determine the fraction of the socks that are red.\n- **Convert to Percentage:** Finally, convert this fraction into a percentage.\n\n### Reflecting on the Strategy\nThis strategy seems solid, but let's move step by step to ensure it works. \n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Socks\nI need to count all the socks to find a total.\n\n1. **White Socks:** Gina has 5 pairs of white socks. There's no indication of how many individual socks she has since it's pairs, but usually, a pair means two. So, 5 pairs of white socks would mean 5 x 2 = 10 white socks.\n2. **Black Socks:** Similarly, 3 pairs of black socks mean 3 x 2 = 6 black socks.\n3. **Red Socks:** Finally, 2 pairs of red socks mean 2 x 2 = 4 red socks.\n\nLet's add these together to find the total number:\n- Total Socks = 10 (white) + 6 (black) + 4 (red) = 20 socks.\n\n### Quick Check:\nDoes 20 sound right? Yes, I've counted all the socks pairs correctly and converted them to individual socks, so 20 feels reasonable.\n\n### Step 2: Fraction of Red Socks\nNext, I want to find out what fraction of the total socks are red:\n\n- Red Socks = 4\n- Total Socks = 20\n\nFraction of Red Socks = Number of Red Socks / Total Socks = 4/20.\n\nReflecting on this fraction: 4/20 can be simplified to 1/5 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.\n\n### Step 3: Converting Fraction to Percentage\nNow, let's convert this fraction of red socks into a percentage:\n\nTo convert a fraction to a percentage, I multiply by 100.\n\nPercentage of Red Socks = (1/5) x 100 = 20%.\n\n### Final Reflection and Check:\nThe process seems logical and calculating 20% fits the steps I took. Once more, let's verify if this answer makes sense:\n- I've accounted for all socks: 10 white, 6 black, and 4 red.\n- Converted pairs to individuals correctly.\n- Simplified the fraction and converted accurately.\n\nYeah, I believe the approach holds up well this time. I've considered different perspectives, checked calculations along the way, and reached a sound conclusion. So, **20% of Gina's socks are red**.",
