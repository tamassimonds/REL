    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Brainstorming:\nWhen I first see the problem, it asks to rewrite the quadratic \\(x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6\\) in the form \\((x+b)^2 + c\\). This reminds me of completing the square, which is a method used to rewrite a quadratic in a different form. Completing the square is often used to derive the vertex form of a quadratic, which aligns with the structure \\((x+b)^2 + c\\).\n\n### Exploring Strategies:\n1. **Completing the Square:** My initial approach is to complete the square, as this method directly transforms a standard quadratic into a square plus a constant.\n2. **Comparison Method:** Another possible strategy is to assume the form \\((x+b)^2 + c\\) and compare coefficients, although completing the square seems more straightforward.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\nLet's move forward with completing the square.\n\n1. **Identify the Coefficient of \\(x\\) and Half It:**\n   - The coefficient of \\(x\\) in the quadratic is 2.6. \n   - Half of 2.6 is \\(\\frac{2.6}{2} = 1.3\\).\n\n2. **Square the Halved Coefficient:**\n   - \\(1.3^2 = 1.69\\).\n\n3. **Adjust the Quadratic for Completion:**\n   - Add and subtract the square inside the quadratic expression to complete the square.\n   - Original expression: \\(x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6\\).\n   - Add and subtract 1.69: \\[x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69 - 1.69 + 3.6.\\]\n\n4. **Reorganize to Form a Perfect Square:**\n   - \\((x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69) + (3.6 - 1.69).\\)\n   - This simplifies to: \\((x + 1.3)^2 + 1.91.\\)\n\n### Verification:\nThe expression is now \\((x + 1.3)^2 + 1.91\\). Let's quickly verify by expanding \\((x + 1.3)^2\\):\n- \\((x + 1.3)^2 = x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69\\). This matches our original quadratic except for the constant.\n- Adding the remaining constant \\(1.91\\) accounts correctly for the original 3.6, as \\(1.69 + 1.91 = 3.6\\).\n\n### Compute \\(b+c\\):\n- Here, \\(b = 1.3\\) and \\(c = 1.91\\).\n- Therefore, \\(b+c = 1.3 + 1.91 = 3.21\\).\n\nAfter double-checking the steps and calculations, everything checks out. I'm confident that the correct and final value of \\(b+c\\) is **3.21**.",

  "ground_truth": "We complete the square.\n\nWe have $(x+1.3)^2 = x^2 + (2.6)x + 1.69$, and so\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2+(2.6)x+3.6 &= (x+1.3)^2 - 1.69 + 3.6 \\\\\n&= (x+1.3)^2 + 1.91.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $b=1.3$ and $c=1.91$, which gives us $b+c = \\boxed{3.21}$."
