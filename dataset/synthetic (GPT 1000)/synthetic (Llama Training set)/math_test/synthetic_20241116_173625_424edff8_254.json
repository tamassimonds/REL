    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into understanding and solving the problem of finding the radical conjugate of \\(5 - 6\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n1. **Understand the Question:** \"Radical conjugate\" makes me think of complex numbers, where the conjugate of \\( a + bi \\) is \\( a - bi \\). This expression, \\( 5 - 6\\sqrt{2} \\), is not complex but involves a radical. So, maybe the concept is similar, but applied to radicals.\n\n2. **First Observation:** The term \\( 6\\sqrt{2} \\) stands out as the radical part, just like the imaginary part in a complex number.\n\n3. **Hypothesize:** The radical conjugate might involve changing the sign of the radical part. So similar to complex conjugates, perhaps the conjugate of \\( 5 - 6\\sqrt{2} \\) could be \\( 5 + 6\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n4. **Ponder on other possible interpretations:** Before moving in one direction, let's consider if there's another way radicals work. I\u2019ve heard about rationalizing denominators, but this isn't a fraction, so that might not apply.\n\n5. **Decide on a strategy:** Testing the initial hypothesis is straightforward, so let's explore if \\( 5 + 6\\sqrt{2} \\) could be correct.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Experimenting with the Hypothesis:** I\u2019m going to multiply the expression by what I think is its radical conjugate, \\( (5 + 6\\sqrt{2}) \\), and see if something interesting happens:\n   \\[\n   (5 - 6\\sqrt{2})(5 + 6\\sqrt{2})\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the Difference of Squares Formula:** \n   - The formula \\( (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2 \\) can be applied here:\n     \\[\n     a = 5, \\quad b = 6\\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a^2 = 5^2 = 25, \\quad b^2 = (6\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36 \\times 2 = 72\n     \\]\n\n3. **Perform the Calculation:**\n   - Apply the formula:\n     \\[\n     (5 - 6\\sqrt{2})(5 + 6\\sqrt{2}) = 25 - 72 = -47\n     \\]\n\n4. **Check Result:**\n   - Multiplying \\( 5 - 6\\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( 5 + 6\\sqrt{2} \\) canceled out the radical parts, because the result is a non-radical number, \\(-47\\). This aligns well with the concept similar to complex numbers, where the product of conjugates is a non-complex (real) number.\n\n### Reflect\n\n- **Verification:** Does this make sense? Yes, because this process eliminates the radicals and simplifies to a pure number, which is a common goal when working with radicals.\n\n- **Comparison with Initial Ideas:** This result supports my initial hypothesis and intuition about changing the sign of the radical part.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe radical conjugate of \\(5 - 6\\sqrt{2}\\) is indeed \\(5 + 6\\sqrt{2}\\). This follows the analogy with complex conjugates and is confirmed by the calculation, which eliminates the radical terms and results in a purely integer expression.\n\nThis feels correct and robust, and it matches with what I expected when thinking about how using conjugates cleans up expressions in maths, whether complex or radical.",
