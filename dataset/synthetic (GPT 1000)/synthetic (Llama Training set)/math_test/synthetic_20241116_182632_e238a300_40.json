    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\nOkay, so we have the polynomial \\( f(x) = x^7 - 3x^3 + 2 \\), and we need to find the polynomial \\( g(x) = f(x + 1) \\) and determine the sum of its coefficients. It's been a while since I tackled a similar problem, but I think I know some ways to get started.\n\nHmm... this reminds me of polynomial transformations where we substitute inside the polynomial. The substitution \\( x+1 \\) usually shifts the graph or changes the polynomial in a specific way. Let's begin by expanding \\( f(x + 1) \\) and then we'll think about getting the sum of the coefficients.\n\nBrainstorming the approach:\n\n1. **Direct Substitution and Expansion**: \n   - The problem asks us to substitute \\( x+1 \\) into \\( f(x) \\) and calculate \\( g(x) = f(x+1) \\). So, I should think about expanding the polynomial after substituting, term by term.\n   - Sounds a bit challenging since expanding parts like \\( (x+1)^7 \\) might involve the binomial theorem or similar steps. Let me write that down and see how it goes.\n\n2. **Sum of Coefficients Method**: \n   - To find the sum of coefficients of a polynomial, we can substitute 1 into the polynomial \\( g(x) \\). The result will be the sum of the coefficients. This approach seems more efficient because it might bypass the need for full expansion.\n\nLet's try both to see what makes sense.\n\n**Step-by-Step Execution:**\n\n1. **Direct Substitution and Expansion**:\n\n   For \\( f(x+1) = (x+1)^7 - 3(x+1)^3 + 2 \\), I know I need to expand:\n   \n   - **Expand \\((x+1)^7\\)**: \n     - The expansion uses the binomial theorem: \n     \\[\n     (x+1)^7 = \\sum_{k=0}^{7} \\binom{7}{k} x^k \\cdot 1^{7-k} = x^7 + 7x^6 + 21x^5 + 35x^4 + 35x^3 + 21x^2 + 7x + 1\n     \\]\n     That looks okay and seems to match what I recall from binomial expansions.\n\n   - **Expand \\(-3(x+1)^3\\)**:\n     - Similarly, use the binomial theorem:\n     \\[\n     (x+1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1\n     \\]\n     So,\n     \\(-3(x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1) = -3x^3 - 9x^2 - 9x - 3\\).\n\n   - Putting it together:\n     \\[ \n     g(x) = (x^7 + 7x^6 + 21x^5 + 35x^4 + 35x^3 + 21x^2 + 7x + 1) - (3x^3 + 9x^2 + 9x + 3) + 2 \n     \\]\n\n     Simplifying, combine the coefficients:\n     - \\( x^7 \\)\n     - \\( + 7x^6 \\)\n     - \\( + 21x^5 \\)\n     - \\( + 35x^4 \\)\n     - \\( + 32x^3 \\)\n     - \\( + 12x^2 \\)\n     - \\( - 2x \\)\n     - \\( = 0 \\).\n\n     Wait, I made a mistake here. Let's recalculate it accurately. Let's review this step just in case of missteps:\n\n   **Correct Sum of Coefficients Calculation**: \n\n   Instead of expansion, maybe just calculate \\( g(1) \\):\n\n   - Substitute 1 in place of x to make this straightforward:\n   \\[\n   g(1) = f(1+1) = f(2) = 2^7 - 3 \\times 2^3 + 2\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate: \n   - \\( 2^7 = 128 \\)\n   - \\( 3 \\times 2^3 = 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\)\n\n   So,\n   \\[\n   g(1) = 128 - 24 + 2 = 106\n   \\]\n\n   Looks good! This verifies correctly and matches expectations given the substitution.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThe sum of the coefficients of \\( g(x) \\) is \\( 106 \\). This number seems manageable, no need to further expand everything explicitly; using \\( g(1) \\) trick simplified the task significantly.",
