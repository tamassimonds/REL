    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We need to find the product of the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints at \\((1,1)\\) and \\((-7,5)\\). \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I see that we\u2019re dealing with finding the midpoint of a line segment. I remember that there's a formula for midpoints. Essentially, the midpoint \\(M\\) of a line segment joining two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n\\[\nM = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to figure out what it means to find the product of the coordinates of the midpoint. This means, once we have the midpoint coordinates, we multiply them together.\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Midpoint Formula\n\nFollowing our formula for the midpoint:\n- \\(x_1 = 1\\), \\(y_1 = 1\\)\n- \\(x_2 = -7\\), \\(y_2 = 5\\)\n\nUsing the midpoint formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Midpoint } M = \\left( \\frac{1 + (-7)}{2}, \\frac{1 + 5}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s compute each coordinate:\n- \\(x\\)-coordinate: \\(\\frac{1 + (-7)}{2} = \\frac{1 - 7}{2} = \\frac{-6}{2} = -3\\)\n- \\(y\\)-coordinate: \\(\\frac{1 + 5}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\\)\n\nSo, the midpoint is \\((-3, 3)\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Product of the Midpoint Coordinates\n\nNow, I need to find the product of these coordinates \\((-3, 3)\\). That means I multiply the x-coordinate with the y-coordinate:\n\\[\n-3 \\times 3 = -9\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Reflecting on the Steps and Final Answer\n\nOkay, now let\u2019s look back and see if everything checks out. I used the correct midpoint formula and substituted properly. Then I computed each part step-by-step, which seems in line with standard arithmetic operations.\n\nSummarizing everything: \n- The midpoint of the line segment joining \\((1,1)\\) and \\((-7,5)\\) is \\((-3, 3)\\).\n- The product of these midpoint coordinates is \\(-9\\).\n\nThe final answer to the problem is \\(-9\\).\n\nOverall, the process felt straightforward using the midpoint formula. I didn\u2019t hit any roadblocks, and the calculations seem reasonable for the given coordinates. Looks good!",

  "ground_truth": "We see that the midpoint has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{1 + (-7)}{2}, \\frac{1+5}{2}\\right) = (-3, 3)$.  Thus our desired answer is $-3\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{-9}$."
