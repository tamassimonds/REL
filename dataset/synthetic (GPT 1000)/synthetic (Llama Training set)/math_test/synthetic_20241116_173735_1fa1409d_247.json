    "working_out": "**First Impressions and Brainstorming:**\n\nAlright, we need to simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{100}{180}\\). The goal is to reduce this fraction to its simplest form. When I see a problem like this, I usually think about finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and then dividing both the numerator and the denominator by this number.\n\nAnother strategy could involve breaking down both numbers into their prime factors and then reducing accordingly. Let\u2019s start by exploring these methods.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n\nFirst, I'll try to find the prime factors of both 100 and 180. This might help me see if there's a common factor.\n\n- **For 100:**\n\n  - 100 is even, so it's divisible by 2: \\(100 \\div 2 = 50\\).\n  - 50 is also even, so divide by 2: \\(50 \\div 2 = 25\\).\n  - 25 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\(25 \\div 5 = 5\\).\n  - Finally, 5 is a prime number.\n \n  So, the prime factorization of 100 is \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\).\n\n- **For 180:**\n\n  - 180 is even, so divide by 2: \\(180 \\div 2 = 90\\).\n  - 90 is even, so divide by 2: \\(90 \\div 2 = 45\\).\n  - 45 ends in 5, so divide by 5: \\(45 \\div 5 = 9\\).\n  - Finally, 9 is divisible by 3: \\(9 \\div 3 = 3\\) and 3 is a prime number.\n\n  So, the prime factorization of 180 is \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Common Factors**\n\nWith prime factorizations:\n- 100: \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\)\n- 180: \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\)\n\nThe common factors are \\(2^2\\) and \\(5\\). Thus, the greatest common divisor (GCD) is \\(2^2 \\times 5 = 20\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify Fraction**\n\nNow that we have the GCD, we can simplify \\(\\frac{100}{180}\\) by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 20:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100 \\div 20}{180 \\div 20} = \\frac{5}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\nAt this point, it makes sense to quickly verify if 5 and 9 have no common factors other than 1, ensuring that the fraction is indeed in its simplest form. The number 5 is a prime number and does not divide 9, which confirms that \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\) is simplified correctly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach worked well and confirmed our final answer. By using prime factorization and identifying the greatest common divisor, simplifying the fraction was straightforward. \n\nThere might have been other approaches, such as iteratively simplifying by progressive division, but using the GCD is efficient and direct. \n\nThus, the simplified form of \\(\\frac{100}{180}\\) is \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since $100$ and $180$ have a common factor of $20$, we can simplify as follows $$\\frac{100}{180}=\\frac{20\\cdot 5}{20\\cdot 9}=\\frac{\\cancel{20}\\cdot 5}{\\cancel{20}\\cdot 9}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}.$$"
