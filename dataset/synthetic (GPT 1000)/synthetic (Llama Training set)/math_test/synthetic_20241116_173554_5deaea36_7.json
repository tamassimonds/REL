    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nThe problem involves a triangle inscribed in a circle with one side as the diameter. Instantly, this reminds me of the Thales' theorem, which states that if a triangle is inscribed in a circle and one side is a diameter, then the angle opposite this side is a right angle (90\u00b0). This would mean that $\\angle C = 90^\\circ$ in triangle $\\triangle ABC$ since $AB$ is the diameter.\n\nOkay, that's a good start. So we already have one piece of the puzzle: $\\angle C = 90^\\circ$.\n\n### What We Know So Far\n1. We have $\\angle A = 14^\\circ$.\n2. $\\angle C = 90^\\circ$ because of Thales' theorem.\n3. We are trying to find $\\angle B$.\n\n### Strategy and Approach\nNormally, the sum of all angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$. This fundamental property of triangles is our key to solving this problem. Let's write this down in the context of our triangle $\\triangle ABC$:\n\n\\[\n\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nWe know that $\\angle A = 14^\\circ$ and $\\angle C = 90^\\circ$. Plug these into the equation:\n\n\\[\n14^\\circ + \\angle B + 90^\\circ = 180^\\circ \n\\]\n\n### Solve for $\\angle B$\nNow let's solve the equation for $\\angle B$:\n\n\\[\n\\angle B = 180^\\circ - 14^\\circ - 90^\\circ\n\\]\n\nDo the subtraction step-by-step:\n\n1. Subtract $14^\\circ$ from $180^\\circ$:  \n   \\[ 180^\\circ - 14^\\circ = 166^\\circ \\]\n\n2. Subtract $90^\\circ$ from $166^\\circ$:  \n   \\[ 166^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 76^\\circ \\]\n\nSo we find that $\\angle B = 76^\\circ$.\n\n### Reflecting and Checking\nLet's briefly check if this makes sense:\n\n1. The triangle angles should add up to $180^\\circ$. With $\\angle A = 14^\\circ$, $\\angle B = 76^\\circ$, and $\\angle C = 90^\\circ$, their sum is:\n   \\[ 14^\\circ + 76^\\circ + 90^\\circ = 180^\\circ \\]\n   This checks out.\n\n2. The application of Thales' theorem makes sense for this configuration as well. Everything aligns as it should, given the conditions of the problem.\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the angle $\\angle B$ in the triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is \\(76^\\circ\\). This conclusion seems consistent and correct based on our understanding of the geometric properties involved.",

  "ground_truth": "If $AB$ is a diameter, that means the triangle must have a right angle at $C.$ Therefore, we have that \\begin{align*}\n\\angle B &= 180^\\circ - (\\angle A + \\angle C) \\\\\n&= 180^\\circ - (14^\\circ + 90^\\circ) = \\boxed{76^\\circ}.\n\\end{align*}"
