You're given the third term and the sixth term, and you need to find the twelfth term. This reminds me of the process of identifying a pattern based on a few known values and using that to figure out future terms. Let's see how to structure this.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n1. **Understanding the Basic Formula**:\n   The general term of an arithmetic sequence can be described as:  \n   \\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d \\]  \n   where \\( a_n \\) is the \\( n \\)-th term, \\( a_1 \\) is the first term, \\( d \\) is the common difference, and \\( n \\) is the term number.\n\n2. **Given Information**:\n   - Third term (\\( a_3 \\)) is 5, which means \\( a_1 + 2d = 5 \\).\n   - Sixth term (\\( a_6 \\)) is -1, which means \\( a_1 + 5d = -1 \\).\n\n3. **Try Solving for Common Difference \\( d \\)**:\n   We have two equations:\n   1. \\( a_1 + 2d = 5 \\)\n   2. \\( a_1 + 5d = -1 \\)\n\n   Let's subtract one equation from the other to eliminate \\( a_1 \\).\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n- Subtract the first equation from the second:\n  \\[\n  (a_1 + 5d) - (a_1 + 2d) = -1 - 5\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3d = -6\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  d = -2\n  \\]\n\nAha, we have the common difference \\( d = -2 \\). Let's use \\( d \\) to find the first term \\( a_1 \\).\n\n4. **Find the First Term \\( a_1 \\)**:\n   Plug \\( d = -2 \\) back into one of the original equations (let's use the first one for simplicity):\n   \\[\n   a_1 + 2(-2) = 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a_1 - 4 = 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a_1 = 9\n   \\]\n\nGreat, now we have both \\( a_1 = 9 \\) and \\( d = -2 \\). Now let\u2019s find the twelfth term \\( a_{12} \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Twelfth Term**:\n   Using the formula for the \\( n \\)-th term:\n   \\[\n   a_{12} = a_1 + (12-1) \\cdot d\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a_{12} = 9 + 11 \\cdot (-2)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a_{12} = 9 - 22\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a_{12} = -13\n   \\]\n\n### Final Check\n\nLet me quickly verify by substituting back briefly into our equations:\n- \\( a_3 = 9 + 2(-2) = 5 \\), which matches.\n- \\( a_6 = 9 + 5(-2) = -1 \\), which matches.\n\nAwesome, everything seems solid. The twelfth term is indeed \\(-13\\). All calculations seem consistent, and the answer checks out. This approach feels correct given the logical steps we took.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter reasoning through the problem step-by-step and attempting calculations and verifications, we conclude that the twelfth term of this arithmetic sequence is \\(-13\\).\n\nThis exploration and calculation process are how these arithmetic sequence problems are typically solved, using a combination of the sequence formula and basic algebra to find unknowns.",

  "ground_truth": "$\\emph{Solution 1: Find the first term and the common difference.}$\n\nLet the first term of the sequence be $a$ and the common difference be $d.$ Then, the third term is $a+2d$ and the sixth term is $a+5d,$ so we have the system $a+2d = 5,$ $a+5d=-1.$ Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $3d = -6,$ so $d=-2.$ Substituting this into either of our original equations gives $a=9,$ so the twelfth term of the sequence is $a+11d = 9+11(-2) = \\boxed{-13}.$\n\n$\\emph{Solution 2: Use our understanding of arithmetic sequences.}$\n\nThe sixth term is $6$ less than the third term. The twelfth term is twice as far from the sixth term $(6$ steps$)$ as the sixth term is from the third term $(3$ steps$).$ Therefore, the twelfth term is $2\\cdot 6 = 12$ less than the sixth term, so it is $-1-12=\\boxed{-13}.$"
