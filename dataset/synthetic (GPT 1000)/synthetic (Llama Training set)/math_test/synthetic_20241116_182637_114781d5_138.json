    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem. We're given a line segment of length 5, with endpoints at \\((1, 2)\\) and \\((4, b)\\). Our job is to find all possible values of \\(b\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- First impression: This is about the distance formula, since we're dealing with the length of a line segment and coordinates.\n- From previous experiences, whenever endpoints and lengths are mentioned, using the distance formula is typically useful.\n\n### Brainstorm Possible Approaches\n\n1. **Distance Formula**:\n   - Apply the formula: \\( \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\).\n   - Here, we can plug in the values \\(x_1 = 1\\), \\(y_1 = 2\\), \\(x_2 = 4\\), and \\(y_2 = b\\).\n   - The equation should equate to the given length of the line segment (5).\n\n2. **Graphical Understanding**:\n   - Visualize points on a coordinate plane, but since we're strictly dealing with algebra, this might just help in intuition, not in calculation.\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation**:\n   - Solve for \\(b\\) using algebraic operations on the formula once it's set up.\n\n### Sketch out the Distance Formula\n\nGiven the points \\((1, 2)\\) and \\((4, b)\\), the distance formula gives us:  \n\\[ \\sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (b - 2)^2} = 5 \\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\\[ \\sqrt{3^2 + (b - 2)^2} = 5 \\]\n\\[ \\sqrt{9 + (b - 2)^2} = 5 \\]\n\n### Solving the Equation\n\nNow, to remove the square root, square both sides:\n\\[ 9 + (b - 2)^2 = 25 \\]\n\nSubtract 9 from both sides:\n\\[ (b - 2)^2 = 16 \\]\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\\[ b - 2 = \\pm 4 \\]\n\nThis gives us two possible equations:\n1. \\( b - 2 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( b - 2 = -4 \\)\n\n### Solve for \\(b\\)\n\n1. **First Equation**: \n   - \\( b - 2 = 4 \\Rightarrow b = 6 \\)\n\n2. **Second Equation**: \n   - \\( b - 2 = -4 \\Rightarrow b = -2 \\)\n\n### Reflect and Verify\n\nAre these calculations sensible? Does the approach make sense? Yes:\n- We used the appropriate formula for distance.\n- Solved the quadratic equation situations correctly.\n- The logic aligns with finding possible values of a single variable to fit the length constraint in a straightforward manner.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe possible values for \\(b\\) are: \\(6, -2\\). \n\nThese results make sense: substituting them back into the distance formula will verify that the distance between points is indeed 5 in both scenarios. \n\nThus, I've checked my work, and everything aligns both algebraically and logically.",

  "ground_truth": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{ (4-1)^2 + (b-2)^2 } = 5$. Solving, we get $3^2 + (b-2)^2 = 5^2$. $(b-2)^2 = 16$, so $b-2=4$ or $b-2=-4$. Solving, we get that $b is one of \\boxed{6, -2}$."
