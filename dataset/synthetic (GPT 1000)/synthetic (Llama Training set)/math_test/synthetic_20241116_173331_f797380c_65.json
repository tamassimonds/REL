    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. My first impression is that it involves compound interest, specifically quarterly compounding over a period of time. This makes me immediately think of the compound interest formula, which typically looks something like \\( A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\), where \\( P \\) is the principal amount, \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate, \\( n \\) is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and \\( t \\) is the number of years.\n\nAlright, let's break it down step by step while I talk through my thought process.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Variables**\n\n- Principal, \\( P \\): This is the initial amount invested, which is \\$10,000.\n- Annual Interest Rate, \\( r \\): The problem states a 10% interest rate, so \\( r = 0.10 \\).\n- Compounding Frequency, \\( n \\): Interest is compounded quarterly, so \\( n = 4 \\).\n- Time Period, \\( t \\): The duration of the investment is 5 years.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the Compound Interest Formula**\n\nThe formula \\( A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\) keeps popping into my head because this is precisely how we calculate future investment value with compound interest. Let's proceed with applying the given variables to this formula.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate within the Formula**\n\nNow, applying the values:\n\n- Replace \\( P \\) with 10,000.\n- Let\u2019s compute \\(\\frac{r}{n}\\): \n  \\[\n  \\frac{r}{n} = \\frac{0.10}{4} = 0.025\n  \\]\n\n- Now calculate \\( nt \\):\n  \\[\n  nt = 4 \\times 5 = 20\n  \\]\n\nThat seems alright. Let\u2019s combine everything now.\n\n**Step 4: Plug in the Values**\n\nWe plug into the formula:\n\\[\nA = 10,000 \\left(1 + 0.025\\right)^{20}\n\\]\n\nNow I need to raise 1.025 to the 20th power. I better double-check my math here, as exponentiation can easily trip up calculations.\n\n**Step 5: Compute**\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\\[\n1.025^{20} \\approx 1.638616442\n\\]\n\nMultiplying that by the principal:\n\\[\nA \\approx 10,000 \\times 1.638616442 \\approx 16,386.16\n\\]\n\nOkay, the number seems reasonable. Reminds me of typical savings growth over a decent duration with compounded interest. I\u2019ll do a quick sanity check.\n\nGiven the principle of \\( \\$10,000 \\) and an interest rate of \\( 10\\% \\) compounded over five years, getting close to double the principal makes intuitive sense, especially since it\u2019s not precisely 10% straight compound but quarterly, which accelerates growth a bit.\n\n**Step 6: Reflect & Verify**\n\nI want to ensure my logic flows and math align correctly, so let me look at this again: The 5-year term with quarterly compounding means we handle growth through periods (quarters) versus just annually. That checks out with what we've done.\n\nWith continual rethinking, it seems all the maths and variables have been correctly handled, with no leaps overlooked.\n\nFinal Answer: \nPaula\u2019s investment will be worth approximately **\\$16,386.16** at the end of the 5 years, rounded to the nearest cent.",

  "ground_truth": "In the first quarter, Paula earns $\\frac{0.10}{4}(\\$10,\\!000)$ in interest, so her investment is worth $\\$10,\\!000 +\\frac{0.10}{4}(\\$10,\\!000) = \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)(\\$10,\\!000)$. Similarly, the value of her investment is multiplied by $1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}$ each quarter, so after 5 years, which is $5\\cdot 4 = 20$ quarters, her investment is worth \\[\\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{5\\cdot 4}(\\$10,\\!000) \\approx \\boxed{\\$16,\\!386.16}.\\]"
