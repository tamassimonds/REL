  "problem": "Two brothers took $x$ cows to the market, and they sold each cow for $x$ dollars. After selling the cows, they divided the money by giving $\\$10$ to the older brother, $\\$10$ to the younger brother, $\\$10$ to the older, $\\$10$ to the younger, and so on.

    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\n- I'm trying to figure out how much money the younger brother received at the last division. \n- It looks like the key here is that they split the money evenly into groups of $10, but the last division has some remainder.\n- Two different people alternatively receiving $10 also hints at some kind of sequence or alternating pattern up to a last, partial payment.\n- Let me see how the problem can be simplified by thinking about the exchange and total money.\n\nUnderstanding the Problem:\n\n- They sold each cow for $x dollars, and they had $x$ cows. \n- This means they received $x \\times x = x^2$ dollars in total.\n- The brother's sharing method suggests alternating $10 to each until none or less than $10 is left.\n- OK, I need to find the principle of evenly splitting the total amount and what the remainder would look like.\n\nFinding Strategy:\n\n1. I need to see how big $x^2$ could be and how alternating sums could divide this entirely except for one partial entry.\n2. I wonder if calculating and exploring $x values and seeing how the numbers divide by 20 (since both $10 each) would help.\n3. Hmm, potentially I calculate for specific x with known factors to observe behavior? Complexiculating the pattern? Trying manual for small x.\n\nExploration of Pattern:\n \n- Let's see, if $x = 1$, we have $1 dollar. $10 to one brother is impossible. So, it can't be $x = 1$.\n- If $x = 2$, $4 total, unable to divide out $10 increment. Nope, not helpful.\n- If $x = 3$, $9 total; if distributed, $10 to the elder (budget insufficient again).\n- If $x = 4$, $16 cannot split into even multiples of 20...er, how about checking they've complete cycles?\n\nRechecking:\n\n- Seems finding an usable non-whole completion must exist...\n- Oh! Here's an idea, they must reach a near complete multiple of 20 less one tiny leftover umm-might dig through around here.\n- Wait, because last entry broke up a full $10, must suggest near 20 gap.\n\nRecalculation / Understanding Solution:\n\n- If $10 goes to elder, younger's slight gain suggests remainder less than $10 disparity.\n- Let's have $x = 5$, $25. You can divide full cycles minus last partial.\n1. $10 each, both reach same, uneven at cut, leaving under $10.\n \nCheck and Conclude:\n\n- Yes! I attempted handling different sequence yet, minimally let's understand it now. \n- Ultimately, must be the remaining divisible yet end not fit prior arranging whole amount. Balance checks guarantee efficiency of found method.\n- After the last $10 to the other brother, $5 must remain for the younger brother.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- The younger brother must have received $5 during the last cycle of exchange.\n- Took trials at various points but finally hitting $5 for completion.\n- Seems just need interpreting correct multiplication boundary and remaining element impression.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous exploration. I need to rethink my approach and carefully examine the logic behind the problem. Let's go through this step by step to arrive at a valid solution.\n\n**Re-evaluation and Understanding:**\n\n1. **Restate the Problem:**\n   - We have $x$ cows, each sold for $x$ dollars, resulting in a total of $x^2$ dollars.\n   - Money is distributed alternately between the two brothers in $10$-dollar increments.\n   - The older brother gets the last full $10$, and the younger brother receives less than $10$ in the final distribution.\n\n2. **Focus on the Sequence:**\n   - The total amount, $x^2$, will be divided as $10$.$10$,$10$... until a remainder is left for the younger brother.\n   - Thus, we need to examine $x^2 \\mod 20$, as each round of distribution is $20$ (two $10s$).\n\n3. **Evaluating the Tens Digit:**\n   - The condition that the older brother gets the last full $10$ suggests the tens digit of the total $x^2$ is odd.\n   - Let's dive deeper into how this constraint shapes our possible $x$ values using the following thinking.\n\n4. **Exploring Alternative Strategy:**\n   - Write $x$ in a form that can simplify the calculations: \\(x = 10a + b\\), where $a$ is the portion divisible by 10 and $b$ is the units digit.\n   - For simplicity, calculate $x^2 = (10a + b)^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2$.\n   - The tens digit of $100a^2$ is $0$, the tens digit of $20ab$ is even, so the tens digit of $20ab + b^2$ must be odd for the entire sum to have an odd tens digit, focusing on $b^2$. \n   \n5. **Identify Possible Values:**\n   - Check when $b^2$ gives an odd tens digit by squaring $b$ from $0$ to $9$:\n     - $b = 4$: $4^2 = 16$ (tens digit is $1$\u2014odd)\n     - $b = 6$: $6^2 = 36$ (tens digit is $3$\u2014odd)\n     - These values satisfy the requirement of the odd tens digit.\n\n6. **Check Last Receivable Units:**\n   - For both $b = 4$ and $b = 6$, the units digit of $b^2$ gives $6$.\n   - Therefore, at the last distribution, the younger brother would receive $\\boxed{6}$ dollars, satisfying the condition of less than $10$ dollars.\n\nBy verifying these calculations, we ensure both potential unit digits $4$ and $6$ lead to the same final amount for the younger brother\u2014$6$ dollars. Hence, the answer aligns with understanding of pattern and conditions.",

  "ground_truth": "Write $x$ in the form $10a + b$, where $b$ is the units digit of $x$ and $a$ is the \"remaining\" part of $x$.  (For example, if $x = 5718$, then $a = 571$ and $b = 8$.)  Then \\[x^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2.\\]Since the older brother was the last brother to receive a whole payment of $\\$10$, the tens digit of $x^2$ must be odd.  The tens digit of $100a^2$ is 0, and the tens digit of $20ab$ is even, so for the tens digit of \\[x^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2\\]to be odd, the tens digit of $b^2$ must be odd.\n\nWe know that $b$ is a digit from 0 to 9.  Checking these digits, we find that the tens digit of $b^2$ is odd only for $b = 4$ and $b = 6$.\n\nWe also see that the units digit of $x^2$ is the same as the units digit of $b^2$.  For both $b = 4$ and $b = 6$, the units digit of $b^2$ is 6.  Therefore, the last payment to the younger brother was $\\boxed{6}$ dollars."
