    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. \n\n**First thoughts:** \n\nOkay, the problem is asking for the area of the largest possible inscribed triangle in a circle where one of the sides is a diameter. The term \"inscribed\" is catching my attention because it implies that the triangle should fit perfectly inside the circle. And oh, having the triangle's side as a diameter... this is a bit of a hint. Wait, I think there\u2019s a related theorem which suggests something about angles and diameters in circles. I need to think about that.\n\n**Consider strategies:**\n\n1. **Brainstorm the geometry of the situation:** A triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter... this reminds me of the property of a semicircle. If I recall correctly, the angle opposite the diameter of a circle is always a right angle. So, the triangle might be a right triangle. Let's see if that leads anywhere.\n\n2. **Using geometry knowledge:** If the diameter is a side of the triangle and it\u2019s inscribed in the circle with the vertex opposite the diameter on the circumference, the triangle is a right triangle. This sounds like something I should check up on \u2013 perhaps \"Thales' theorem\"? Yep, got it, Thales' theorem states exactly this! The triangle is indeed a right triangle.\n\n3. **Reflect and adjust plan if needed:** Okay, I need to pin down more precisely how the size of this right triangle relates to its area. What's known? The diameter is 20 cm because the radius is 10 cm. So, one side of the triangle (hypotenuse) is 20 cm.\n\n4. **Area calculation approach:** The area of a triangle is generally \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\). For a right triangle, if the diameter is the hypotenuse, then I need to think about how to maximize the base and height. \n\n**Calculate:**\n\n- The circle is centered at (0,0) with radius 10 cm, implying a diameter from (-10,0) to (10,0) which is 20 cm long.\n- To maximize the area of the inscribed triangle (with a diameter as the base), place one vertex of the triangle at the highest point on the semicircle above this base.\n- At this point, the y-coordinate is simply the radius, because it's the full height right above the midpoint of the diameter.\n- So, the coordinates might be something like (-10,0), (10,0) and (0,10).\n\n**Check my work:**\n\n- Quick check: The base is indeed 20 cm long. \n- Calculate the area: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 \\times 10 = 100\\).\n\nThat number fits a level-headed size I expect for an area considering the diameter length. \n\n**Aha moment:** This makes sense! The right triangle has its maximum area when the height is exactly equal to the radius, forming that right angle thanks to Thales' theorem. Indeed, this is the largest area we can get under those constraints.\n\nIn conclusion, the area of the largest possible inscribed triangle is 100 square centimeters.",

  "ground_truth": "We may consider the diameter of circle $C$ as the base of the inscribed triangle; its length is $20\\text{ cm}$. Then the corresponding height extends from some point on the diameter to some point on the circle $C$. The greatest possible height is a radius of $C$, achieved when the triangle is right isosceles: [asy]\nunitsize(8);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),10));\ndraw(((-10,0)--(10,0)));\nlabel(\"$20$\",(0,0),S);\ndraw(((-10,-0.8)--(-0.8,-0.6)),BeginArrow);\ndraw(((0.8,-0.8)--(10,-0.8)),EndArrow);\ndraw(((-10,0)--(0,10)));\ndraw(((0,10)--(10,0)));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,10)),dashed);\nlabel(\"$10$\",(0,2.5),E);\n[/asy] In this case, the height is $10\\text{ cm}$, so the area of the triangle is $$\\frac 12\\cdot 20\\cdot 10 = \\boxed{100}\\text{ square centimeters}.$$"
