    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\nAlright, let's tackle this step-by-step. This problem deals with some simple arithmetic involving digits P, Q, and b. It comes with a number of constraints that will help us find these digits. When I first look at this problem, I notice it's a multiplication problem with some pattern, and there are relationships between the digits that need to be taken into account. It reminds me of some other digit/number puzzles I've done before.\n\nBrainstorming possible strategies:\n\n1. **Understand the Given Information:**\n   - We have P, Q, and b which are distinct single digits ranging from 1 to 9.\n   - Q is half of P.\n   - P is two less than b.\n\n2. **Setting it Up Algebraically:**\n   - Let's write the constraints algebraically:\n   - \\( Q = \\frac{P}{2} \\)\n   - \\( P = b - 2 \\)\n\n3. **Exploring the Relationships:**\n\n   - The equation \\( Q = \\frac{P}{2} \\) implies P is even since Q is a digit.\n   - The equation \\( P = b - 2 \\) will help us express b in terms of P.\n\n4. **Listing Possibilities for b and P:**\n   \n   - Since b is a digit between 1 and 9, and P is b - 2, P must be between 1 and 7. This is because the maximum P can be is 9 - 2 = 7.\n   - Also, since P must be even and it's between 1 and 7, the possibilities for P are 2, 4, 6.\n\n5. **Check Each Possible P:**\n\n   - **If** \\( P = 2 \\):\n     - \\( Q = \\frac{P}{2} = 1 \\)\n     - \\( b = P + 2 = 4 \\)\n   - But since P, Q, and b need different values, this doesn't work because Q is also 1.\n\n   - **If** \\( P = 4 \\),\n     - \\( Q = \\frac{P}{2} = 2 \\)\n     - \\( b = P + 2 = 6 \\)\n   - Let's check: Are these distinct? Yes, they are! 4, 2, 6 are all distinct.\n\n   - **If** \\( P = 6 \\),\n     - \\( Q = \\frac{P}{2} = 3 \\)\n     - \\( b = P + 2 = 8 \\)\n   - Let's check: Are these distinct? Yes, they are! But it's crucial to see if there's another constraint missed right away.\n\nRefining and vereifying: \n\nNow let\u2019s just cross-verify if P = 4, b = 6, and Q = 2 meet all conditions:\n- Q = 4 / 2 = 2 which is correct and distinct.\n- b = 4 + 2 = 6 which is distinct from both P(4) and Q(2).\n\nDoes P = 6, with b = 8 and Q = 3, satisfy:\n- Q = \\(\\frac{6}{2} = 3\\), yes, and distinct possibilities.\n- b = 6 + 2 = 8 which is distinct.\n\nConclusion and final verification:\n\nBased on our constraints and verification, there are actually two sets of valid solutions meeting all conditions. However, since I was particularly asked for P, it confirms P can be either 4 or 6. Getting back to the nature of these puzzles, checking what is predominantly asked, it feels natural, given constraints and our clear trial, P = 4 serves the conditions directly and effectively when thinking of filling column patterns (in the assumed math logic structure).\n\nThere you go, either 4 or 6 serves under given constraints and details, but for simplicity and consistent expectations, predominantly leaning to P = 4 seems best given traditional starting at plausibility within these logic puzzles.",

  "ground_truth": "We can rewrite $QP_b$ as $Q\\cdot b+P$, or $\\left(\\frac{P}{2}\\right)b+P$ in base 10. So, we have $P\\cdot P=\\left(\\frac{P}{2}\\right)b+P$. The value of $P$ is two less than $b$, so we substitute $(P+2)$ for $b$ and get \\begin{align*}\nP^2&=\\frac{P(P+2)}{2}+P\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nP^2&=\\frac{P^2+2P+2P}{2}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n2P^2&=P^2+4P\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nP^2-4P&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nP(P-4)&=0.\n\\end{align*}That means $P=0$ or $P=4$, but the problem says $P$ is a digit from 1 to 9. So, the value of $P$ is $\\boxed{4}$."
