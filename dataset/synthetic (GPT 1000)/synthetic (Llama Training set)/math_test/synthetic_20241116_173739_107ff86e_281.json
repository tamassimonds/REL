    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive in!\n\n**First, I want to understand the problem:**\n\nWe are given a triangle \\(\\triangle ABC\\) with an altitude \\(AK\\) from \\(A\\) to segment \\(\\overline{BC}\\). We know the lengths:\n- \\(AK = 6\\),\n- \\(BK = 8\\),\n- \\(CK = 6\\).\n\nWe're asked to find the perimeter of the triangle. \n\n**Brainstorming approaches:**\n\n1. **Visual Representation**: If I could sketch the triangle, it might help. Visualizing that \\(AK\\) is perpendicular to \\(\\overline{BC}\\) could make it easier to comprehend the triangle's orientation and lengths. \n\n2. **Use of Triangles Properties**: Given \\(AK\\) as an altitude, \\(\\triangle ABK\\) and \\(\\triangle ACK\\) are right triangles. Right triangles can have properties (like the Pythagorean Theorem) that might help calculate side lengths.\n\n3. **Calculate Side Lengths**: The perimeter requires lengths of \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\). Perhaps I can use Pythagoras's Theorem on \\(\\triangle ABK\\) and \\(\\triangle ACK\\).\n\n4. **Check the Consistency of the Given Values**: Sometimes, measures don't make sense, but here, \\(AK\\) being part of two different right triangles can lead us to verify the problem setup by trying calculations for sanity checks.\n\n**Applying these ideas:**\n\n1. **Consider the Triangle Components**: \n   - Triangle \\(\\triangle ABK\\) is a right triangle, and so is \\(\\triangle ACK\\).\n   - For \\(\\triangle ABK\\), the sides are \\(AB\\), \\(BK\\), and \\(AK\\). Here, by Pythagoras: \\(AB^2 = AK^2 + BK^2\\).\n   - For \\(\\triangle ACK\\), the sides are \\(AC\\), \\(CK\\), and \\(AK\\). Similarly, \\(AC^2 = AK^2 + CK^2\\).\n\n2. **Calculations**: \n   - For \\(\\triangle ABK\\): \n     \\(AB^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100\\), so \\(AB = \\sqrt{100} = 10\\).\n\n   - For \\(\\triangle ACK\\): \n     \\(AC^2 = 6^2 + 6^2 = 36 + 36 = 72\\), so \\(AC = \\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n3. **Check Consistency**: \n   - The measures for \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\) seem reasonable given the given sides.\n\n4. **Calculate the Perimeter**: \n   - Now that we know \\(AB\\), \\(BC\\), and \\(AC\\), we can find the perimeter:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Perimeter} = AB + BC + AC = 10 + (BK + CK) + 6\\sqrt{2} = 10 + 14 + 6\\sqrt{2} = 24 + 6\\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n\n**Reflecting on the solution**:\n- I ensured that the calculations adhered to the properties of right triangles.\n- I double-checked the arithmetic and consistency with the given lengths in the problem.\n- The results are realistic and consistent with a right-angled triangle setup, so I'm confident in this solution.\n\nIt appears that everything checks out and the perimeter of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is indeed \\(24 + 6\\sqrt{2}\\).",
