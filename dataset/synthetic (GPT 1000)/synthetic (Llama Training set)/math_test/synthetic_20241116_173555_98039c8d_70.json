    "working_out": "**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst, let's understand what we are being asked to do. We need to find the sum of the \\( x \\)-coordinates of the \\( x \\)-intercepts of two lines:\n\n1. Line 1: \\( y = \\frac{1}{3}x + 7 \\)\n2. Line 2: \\( y = 2x + 5 \\)\n\nThe \\( x \\)-intercept is where the line crosses the \\( x \\)-axis. This occurs where \\( y = 0 \\). So, for each line, I need to find the value of \\( x \\) when \\( y = 0 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Find the \\( x \\)-Intercept of the First Line \\( (y = \\frac{1}{3}x + 7) \\)**\n\nSet \\( y = 0 \\) in the equation for the first line:\n\n\\[ 0 = \\frac{1}{3}x + 7 \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( x \\):\n\n- Subtract 7 from both sides: \\( 0 - 7 = \\frac{1}{3}x \\) which simplifies to \\( -7 = \\frac{1}{3}x \\).\n\n- Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: \\( 3(-7) = x \\).\n\n\\[ x = -21 \\]\n\nSo, the \\( x \\)-intercept for the first line is \\( x = -21 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Reflect and Check**\n\nLet's quickly check this calculation. Setting \\( \\frac{1}{3}x + 7 = 0 \\), solving gives \\( x = -21 \\). This is a straightforward calculation, and it seems correct.\n\n**Step 4: Find the \\( x \\)-Intercept of the Second Line \\( (y = 2x + 5) \\)**\n\nSet \\( y = 0 \\) in the equation for the second line:\n\n\\[ 0 = 2x + 5 \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( x \\):\n\n- Subtract 5 from both sides: \\( 0 - 5 = 2x \\) which simplifies to \\( -5 = 2x \\).\n\n- Divide both sides by 2: \\( x = -\\frac{5}{2} \\).\n\n\\[ x = -2.5 \\]\n\nSo, the \\( x \\)-intercept for the second line is \\( x = -2.5 \\).\n\n**Step 5: Reflect and Check**\n\nLet's quickly check this calculation. Setting \\( 2x + 5 = 0 \\), solving gives \\( x = -2.5 \\). Checking the steps shows they are straightforward and the calculations are correct.\n\n**Step 6: Sum the \\( x \\)-Intercepts**\n\nNow we sum the \\( x \\)-intercepts we have found:\n\n\\[ x = -21 \\quad \\text{for the first line} \\]\n\\[ x = -2.5 \\quad \\text{for the second line} \\]\n\nAdd these together:\n\n\\[ -21 + (-2.5) = -21 - 2.5 = -23.5 \\]\n\n**Step 7: Final Reflection**\n\nThe sum of the \\( x \\)-coordinates of the \\( x \\)-intercepts of the two lines is \\(-23.5\\). I've checked each step, and everything appears correct. Thus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-23.5} \\]",

  "ground_truth": "The $x$-intercept occurs where $y=0$.  For the first equation, setting $0 = \\frac{1}{3} x + 7$ yields $x = -21$.  For the second equation, setting $0 = 2x + 5$ yields $x = -2.5$.  Adding these together, our answer is $-21 + -2.5 = \\boxed{-23.5}$."
