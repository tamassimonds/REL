    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem about counting the squares. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first look at this, I see that the problem is asking about a $5 \\times 5$ grid containing a black center square. We need to count how many squares of different sizes can contain this center square. I'm imagining different sizes of squares - $1 \\times 1$, $2 \\times 2$, etc. up to $5 \\times 5$. Each of those has potential to include the center, but I'm not sure yet how to systematically count them. It feels like one of those tasks where breaking it down to each size individually might be useful. \n\nSo I\u2019m thinking to explore systematically: start with the smallest squares and then larger ones. \n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Center Position**\n\nThe black center square is at position \\( (2, 2) \\) on the grid\u2014keeping in mind this is a zero-indexed grid.\n\n**Step 2: Start with 1x1 Squares**\n\n- A 1x1 square can only contain itself, so only the 1x1 square at position (2, 2) contains the black center. That's straightforward\u20141 such square.\n\n**Reflection: Good Start**\n \nOne 1x1 square containing the center: makes sense logically.\n\n**Step 3: Consider 2x2 Squares**\n\nLet's see how many 2x2 squares can include the black center square.\n\n- A 2x2 square needs the top-left corner to be either (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), or (2, 2) to include the center (2, 2). \n  - Calculate: \n    1. (1,1) extends to cover (1,1) to (2,2)\n    2. (1,2) extends to cover (1,2) to (2,3)\n    3. (2,1) extends to cover (2,1) to (3,2)\n    4. (2,2) extends to cover (2,2) to (3,3)\n\nThis gives us 4 possible 2x2 squares.\n\n**Reflection: Confidence Building**\n\nLooks good for 2x2. I can visually see/imagine those options on the grid.\n\n**Step 4: Move onto 3x3 Squares**\n\n- Now, consider a 3x3 square. The black center square must be fully contained. Its top left corner could be at:\n  - (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)\n  - (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)\n  - (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)\n\nVisualizing each, these are 9 possible positions where a 3x3 square could enclose the center. Each position covers from its top-left to a 3-unit square.\n\n**Reflection: Figuring Patterns**\n\nGot the approach right for 3x3. This is shaping the strategy for larger squares as well.\n\n**Step 5: Count 4x4 Squares**\n\n- For a 4x4 square to include the center (2, 2), the top left can be at:\n  - (0, 0), (0, 1)\n  - (1, 0), (1, 1)\n\nVisually working out these options, there are 4 different 4x4 squares that cover the center.\n\n**Reflection: Thorough Check**\n\nPerfect, matches my visualization. Building confidence with the systematic nature.\n\n**Step 6: Finally, 5x5 Square**\n\n- Only one 5x5 square that covers the entire grid, and it surely covers the center (2, 2).\n\n**Overall Reflection and Checking**\n\nTotal squares including the center:\n- 1x1: 1 square\n- 2x2: 4 squares\n- 3x3: 9 squares\n- 4x4: 4 squares\n- 5x5: 1 square\n\nAdding them up: \\(1 + 4 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 19\\).\n\nAfter each step and reflection, this feels correct. We've checked at each size level independently, verifying visual placement where the black center is always counted.\n\nThus, there are **19 squares** that include the black center square in the 5x5 grid.",
