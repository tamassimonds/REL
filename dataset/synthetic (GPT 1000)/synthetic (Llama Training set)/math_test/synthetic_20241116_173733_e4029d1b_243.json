    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this expression step by step. The goal is to simplify the expression $$[(1\\cdot2)+(3\\cdot4)-(5\\cdot6)+(7\\cdot8)]\\cdot(9\\cdot0)$$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the structure of the expression. There are two main parts:\n\n1. The expression inside the square brackets: \\((1\\cdot2)+(3\\cdot4)-(5\\cdot6)+(7\\cdot8)\\)\n2. The multiplication of this entire expression by \\((9\\cdot0)\\) outside the brackets.\n\nFrom my experience, \\((9\\cdot0)\\) will simplify to 0, which is going to have a major impact on the entire expression. When you multiply anything by zero, the result is always zero. So, my first thought is that the whole expression will simplify to zero. But let's work through it anyway to verify.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify Inside the Brackets\n\nLet's start simplifying the expression inside the square brackets:\n\n- \\(1 \\cdot 2 = 2\\)\n- \\(3 \\cdot 4 = 12\\)\n- \\(5 \\cdot 6 = 30\\)\n- \\(7 \\cdot 8 = 56\\)\n\nNow, plug these values back into the original expression inside the brackets:\n\\[\n2 + 12 - 30 + 56\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify Further\n\nLet's combine these values step by step to see what they add up to:\n\n1. \\(2 + 12 = 14\\)\n2. \\(14 - 30 = -16\\)\n3. \\(-16 + 56 = 40\\)\n\nSo, the expression inside the brackets simplifies to 40.\n\n### Step 4: Multiply by the Outer Term\n\nNow that we have simplified the expression inside the brackets to 40, let's multiply it by the outer term \\((9 \\cdot 0)\\):\n\n- \\(9 \\cdot 0 = 0\\)\n\nUsing the property of multiplication that anything multiplied by zero is zero, the entire expression: \n\\[\n40 \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Final Check and Reflection\n\nUh oh! I jumped right to knowing zero would result from multiplying at the beginning, but I'm glad I checked. Indeed, the calculated steps showed that the expression inside the brackets went to 40, but the multiplication by zero confirms the entire expression simplifies to zero. \n\nIs everything correct? Yes, everything checks out based on the arithmetic rules we've used. I didn't miss any steps and didn't make any errors in calculating the expressions within brackets or the multiplication outside.\n\nIn conclusion, the entire original expression \\( [(1\\cdot2)+(3\\cdot4)-(5\\cdot6)+(7\\cdot8)]\\cdot(9\\cdot0) \\) simplifies neatly to zero.",
