    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this!\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe have a polynomial \\(x^2 + bx + b\\) which is a factor of a cubic polynomial \\(x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + c\\). Our goal is to find all possible values of \\(b\\). \n\nImmediately, this triggers thoughts about polynomial division or using conditions to determine when one polynomial is a factor of another.\n\n**Initial Thoughts and Strategy:**\n\n1. **Factor Comparison:** Since \\(x^2 + bx + b\\) is a factor, dividing the cubic polynomial by this quadratic should leave us with a linear polynomial (a factor condition).\n\n2. **Root Consideration:** We could consider using the fact that if a polynomial divides another, then roots of the divisor polynomial might give us some insight regarding the coefficients. \n\n3. **Direct Solving:** Another approach is substituting potential roots of \\(x^2 + bx + b = 0\\) into the cubic polynomial to enforce the divisibility, i.e., zero-remainder condition.\n\nMy first instinct is to start with polynomial division since it seems direct when dealing with polynomial factors. \n\n**Trying Polynomial Division:**\n\nGiven:\n\\[x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + c = (x^2 + bx + b)(x + d)\\]\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\\[(x^2 + bx + b)(x + d) = x^3 + dx^2 + bx^2 + bdx + bx + bd\\]\n\nMatching coefficients with \\(x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + c\\):\n\n- Coefficient of \\(x^3\\): 1.\n- Coefficient of \\(x^2\\): \\(d + b = 2\\).\n- Coefficient of \\(x\\): \\(bd + b = 2\\).\n- Constant term: \\(bd = c\\).\n\nLet's tackle each of these step-by-step. Firstly, \\(d + b = 2\\). We'll keep it aside for now since \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) are our variables. Moving to the \\(x\\) coefficient:\n\nFrom \\(bd + b = 2\\), we can rewrite as \\(b(d + 1) = 2\\). Using \\(d = 2 - b\\) (from \\(d + b = 2\\)), substitute into the second equation:\n\n\\[b((2 - b) + 1) = 2\\]\n\\[b(3 - b) = 2\\]\n\\[3b - b^2 = 2\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[b^2 - 3b + 2 = 0\\]\n\n**Checking the Factorization of the Quadratic:**\n\n\\(b^2 - 3b + 2\\) factors to:\n\\[(b - 1)(b - 2) = 0\\]\n\nSo the solutions for \\(b\\) are \\(b = 1\\) and \\(b = 2\\). I should verify these to ensure correctness.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **For \\(b = 1\\):**\n\n   - \\(d = 2 - 1 = 1\\).\n   - Check \\(bd + b = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 2\\). This holds true.\n   - \\(bd = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\\). Assign this to \\(c\\).\n\n   The cubic then can be checked by direct substitution, but division behavior seems consistent.\n\n2. **For \\(b = 2\\):**\n\n   - \\(d = 2 - 2 = 0\\).\n   - Check \\(bd + b = 2 \\cdot 0 + 2 = 2\\). This also holds.\n   - \\(bd = 2 \\cdot 0 = 0\\). Assign this to \\(c\\).\n\n   Again, viewing behavior matches expectations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth \\(b = 1\\) and \\(b = 2\\) are valid such that \\(x^2 + bx + b\\) is a factor of \\(x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + c\\). \n\nThus, the solutions for \\(b\\) which works properly are: \\(b = 1, 2\\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nEach calculation checks out with assigning values based on factor identity. This approach of breaking down into smaller equations and checking them independently ensured accuracy. I anticipated constraints for \\(d\\) and applied them effectively during my calculations. Using these consistent patterns simplifies solutions, and my solution seems complete and verified.",
