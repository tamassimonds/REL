    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dig into this step by step. I see we\u2019re given a quadratic equation for the height of a cannonball at any time \\( t \\). The aim here is to determine the time duration for which this cannonball is above 6 meters. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nLooking at this height function \\( h(t) = -4.9t^2 + 14t - 0.4 \\), it appears to be a typical projectile motion problem. The coefficient \\(-4.9\\) suggests we are dealing with real-world physics due to gravity (assuming units of meters and seconds). Projectile motions often have a peak and symmetrically curved path, which confirms the parabolic shape of the trajectory. \n\nFirst Thought: \"Okay, I think I can find when the height is exactly 6 meters, which will give me two points in time (since this is a quadratic). Then, I can look at the interval between those times.\"\n\n### Defining the Problem\n\nWe set \\( h(t) = 6 \\) to find when the height is exactly 6 meters:\n\\[ -4.9t^2 + 14t - 0.4 = 6 \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\\[ -4.9t^2 + 14t - 0.4 - 6 = 0 \\]\n\\[ -4.9t^2 + 14t - 6.4 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation \\( at^2 + bt + c = 0 \\).\n\n### Solving the Quadratic Equation\n\nI think we should use the quadratic formula here: \n\\[ t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nAssigning values \\( a = -4.9 \\), \\( b = 14 \\), and \\( c = -6.4 \\):\n\\[ t = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{14^2 - 4 \\times (-4.9) \\times (-6.4)}}{2 \\times (-4.9)} \\]\n\nChecking calculations:\n1. Compute \\( b^2 = 14^2 = 196 \\)\n2. Calculate \\( 4ac = 4 \\times (-4.9) \\times (-6.4) = 125.44 \\)\n3. Find the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac = 196 - 125.44 = 70.56 \\)\n\nGood, the discriminant is positive, confirming there are two real roots.\n\nPlug these back into the formula to find \\( t \\):\n\\[ t = \\frac{-14 \\pm \\sqrt{70.56}}{-9.8} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate \\(\\sqrt{70.56}\\):\n\\[ \\sqrt{70.56} \\approx 8.4 \\]\n\nSo the times are:\n\\[ t_1 = \\frac{-14 + 8.4}{-9.8} \\]\n\\[ t_2 = \\frac{-14 - 8.4}{-9.8} \\]\n\nCalculate:\n\\[ t_1 = \\frac{-5.6}{-9.8} = 0.5714 \\, \\text{seconds (approx.)} \\]\n\\[ t_2 = \\frac{-22.4}{-9.8} = 2.2857 \\, \\text{seconds (approx.)} \\]\n\n### Reflection\n\n\"That seems reasonable. We should have two points in time since it's a parabolic motion: when the cannonball first goes above 6 meters and when it comes down to 6 meters again.\"\n\n### Duration Above 6 Meters\n\nNow, the duration the cannonball is above 6 meters is simply the difference between these two points:\n\\[ \\Delta t = t_2 - t_1 = 2.2857 - 0.5714 = 1.7143 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nConverting \\( \\Delta t \\) to an improper fraction:\n\\[ 1.7143 \\approx \\frac{12}{7} \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHence, the cannonball is above a height of 6 meters for \\( \\frac{12}{7} \\) seconds. \n\n### Verifying the Solution\n\n- **Check calculations:** The discriminant seemed spot-checked, and \\(\\sqrt{70.56}\\) approximated (for simplicity under time constraints, though precise check shows minor digit disparity).\n- **Global sense-check:** The path characterized is consistent with nature of symmetric projectile motion through a gravitational field, encompassing expected arc and behavior.\n\nThe problem appears correctly addressed, and all logical steps have yielded the desired outcome - answer confirmed with proper mathematical groundwork.",

  "ground_truth": "The cannonball is above $6$ meters in height when $-4.9t^2 + 14t - 0.4 \\ge 6.$ Rearranging and multiplying through by $-10$, it follows that $$49t^2 - 140t + 64 \\le 0.$$The quadratic expression factors as $$(7t - 4)(7t - 16) \\le 0;$$then $7t-4, 7t-16$ have opposite signs, so it follows that $\\frac 47 \\le t \\le \\frac {16}7$. The cannonball then spends $\\frac {16}7 - \\frac 47 = \\boxed{\\frac{12}{7}}$ seconds above the height of $6$ meters.\n\n[asy]\nimport graph; size(8.945cm); real lsf=0.5; pen dps=linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10); defaultpen(dps); pen ds=black; real xmin=-2.935,xmax=7.01,ymin=-3.295,ymax=11.24;\n\nreal f1(real x){return -4.9*x^2+14*x-0.4;}\nfilldraw(graph(f1,-2.925,7)--cycle,rgb(0.95,0.6,0.55),linewidth(1.6));\n\nLabel laxis; laxis.p=fontsize(10);\n\nxaxis(xmin,xmax,defaultpen+black,Ticks(laxis,Step=2.0,Size=2,NoZero),Arrows(6),above=true);\nyaxis(ymin,ymax,defaultpen+black,Ticks(laxis,Step=2.0,Size=2,NoZero),Arrows(6),above=true); draw((xmin,0*xmin+6)--(xmax,0*xmax+6),linewidth(1.2)+linetype(\"4 4\"));\n\ndot((0.5714,6),ds); label(\"$A$\",(0.755,6.29),NE*lsf); dot((2.2857,6),ds); label(\"$B$\",(2.465,6.29),NE*lsf);\n\nclip((xmin,ymin)--(xmin,ymax)--(xmax,ymax)--(xmax,ymin)--cycle);\n\n[/asy]"
