    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem about finding the period of the function \\( y = \\cos x + \\cos 2x + \\cos 3x \\). At first glance, this seems familiar...\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n\n- I remember that the period of a cosine function \\( \\cos(kx) \\) is given by \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{k} \\). Perhaps I can use this knowledge here.\n- I haven't worked with sums of cosines in a while. It might be similar to looking at functions like \\( \\cos x + \\sin x \\), where the period is determined by some kind of least common multiple of the periods.\n- I'll check if there's an easy way out, maybe some trigonometric identity or property simplifies the expression. If not, I might need to explore whether to graph it or analyze factors of the periods.\n\nOkay, first step, list the periods of the individual components:\n\n1. The period of \\( \\cos x \\) is \\( 2\\pi \\).\n2. The period of \\( \\cos 2x \\) is \\( \\pi \\) (since \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{2} = \\pi \\)).\n3. The period of \\( \\cos 3x \\) is \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\).\n\n### Brainstorming:\n\n- The combined period of \\( y \\) should be the smallest positive \\( T \\) such that all the cosines repeat. It probably involves the least common multiple (LCM) or some relationship between these periods.\n- I might need to refresh on the formula for LCM if it comes to that... maybe I won't need it if just thinking through works well enough.\n\n### Calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM):\n\n- Consider \\( T_1 = 2\\pi \\), \\( T_2 = \\pi \\), and \\( T_3 = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\). I need the smallest \\( T \\) such that \\( \\frac{T}{2\\pi} \\), \\( \\frac{T}{\\pi} \\), and \\( \\frac{T}{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}} \\) are all integers.\n  \n  Thinking deeper, only \\( T \\) values that are integer multiples of each period are valid.\n\n- Let's translate these periods into a common ground: \\( 2\\pi = 6\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\), \\( \\pi = 3\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\), and \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\).\n\n  - Looking for the LCM of these: the denominators give a sense, I suspect:\n\n  So,\n\n  - Multiples of \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\) need to be considered with others: \n    - \\( 6\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\), \\( 3\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\), and \\( 2\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\).\n\n  - Finding common multiples: The smallest common multiple here is \\( 6\\frac{\\pi}{3} = 2\\pi \\).\n\n### Reflect & Check:\n\n- I've calculated an LCM approach without actually using a numerical LCM computation and reasoned my way through.\n- This must imply \\( T = 2\\pi \\) is the smallest period for which the combination repeats itself fully.\n  \nGiven this reasoning, which matches with known period behaviors and relationships in trigonometric functions, I conclude:\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe period of \\( y = \\cos x + \\cos 2x + \\cos 3x \\) is \\( 2\\pi \\). This makes sense because it's the longest period among the individual components\u2019 periods (where their combined behavior renews). \n\nAlright, this systematic approach seems right. Took a bit to confirm, but ultimately, everything sticks well with known segmental period understandings.",
