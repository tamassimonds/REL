    "working_out": "Let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll start by trying to understand the problem and explore different strategies.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nThe given condition is \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r,100] \\cdot \\gcd(r,100) = 13200\\). This reminds me of a useful property: For any two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\),\n\n\\[\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a, b] \\cdot \\gcd(a, b) = a \\cdot b\n\\]\n\nBut here, the equation involves the integer \\(r\\) and the specific number 100. Let's consider that and try to connect it to the given condition. The equation suggests:\n\n\\[\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r, 100] \\times \\gcd(r, 100) = 13200\n\\]\n\nLet's dissect that.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategy:**\n\n- We know that \\(\\gcd(r, 100)\\) divides both \\(r\\) and \\(100\\).\n- \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r, 100]\\) is a multiple of both \\(r\\) and \\(100\\).\n- By the lcm-gcd property, it feels like there's a potential simplified relation between these quantities, especially given the fixed product.\n  \nMaybe start by factoring 100 and seeing how that plays into \\(\\gcd\\) and \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}\\):\n\n100 can be expressed as \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\).\n\n**Approach 1: Factor Analysis:**\n\nWhen we consider \\(r\\), it might share some of these factors with 100 to satisfy the lcm-gcd condition:\n\nLet's denote \\(r\\) as having factor \\(2^a \\times 5^b \\times k\\), where \\(k\\) is coprime with 2 and 5. The common divisors can then be analyzed, and \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}\\) affects these, too.\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(r,100) = 2^{\\min(a,2)} \\times 5^{\\min(b,2)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r,100] = 2^{\\max(a,2)} \\times 5^{\\max(b,2)} \\times k \n\\]\n\nSubstitute these into the product condition and start solving.\n\nThese expressions yield:\n\n\\[ \n2^{\\max(a,2)} \\cdot 5^{\\max(b,2)} \\cdot k \\cdot 2^{\\min(a,2)}\\cdot 5^{\\min(b,2)} = 13200\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's factor 13200:\n\n13200 = \\(2^4 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 \\times 11\\)\n\nSince \\(13200\\) contains the prime 11, and not 5, \\(k\\) likely has this factor. Let's also consider \\(\\max\\) and \\(\\min\\) impacts:\n\n- \\(2^{\\max(a,2) + \\min(a,2)} = 2^4\\), which means \\(a = 2\\).\n- \\(5^{\\max(b,2) + \\min(b,2)} = 5^2\\), indicates \\(b \\leq 2\\).\n  \nIf \\(b = 2\\), \\(\\max(b,2) = 2\\) and \\(\\min(b,2) = 2\\), satisfying.\n\nNow, work with \\(k\\): \n\n- With \\(b = 2 \\), 100 entails no new primes; 3 and 11 must be covered by \\(k\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(r = 100 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11 = 3300\\).\n\n**Checking LCM:**\n\n\\[ \n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[3300, 100] = 3300\n\\]\n\nFinally, confirm:\n\n\\[ \n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r, 100] \\cdot \\gcd(r, 100) = 3300 \\cdot 4 = 13200\n\\]\n\nThis checks out with both initial conditions and calculations. Therefore, \\(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r, 100]\\) is indeed \\(\\boxed{3300}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The identity $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot\\gcd(a,b) = ab$ holds for all positive integer pairs $(a,b)$, so in this case, we have $$13200 = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[r,100]\\cdot\\gcd(r,100) = r\\cdot 100.$$Solving this equation yields $r=132$, so we are looking for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[132,100]$. We have the prime factorizations $132=2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 11$ and $100=2^2\\cdot 5^2$, so, taking the maximum exponent of each prime, we obtain $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[132,100] = 2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 11 = (2^2\\cdot 5^2)(3\\cdot 11) = (100)(33) = \\boxed{3300}.$$(We could also note that the common prime factors of $132$ and $100$ are just $2^2$, which tells us that $\\gcd(132,100)=4$ and so $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[132,100]=\\frac{13200}{4}=3300$.)"
