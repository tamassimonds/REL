    "working_out": "Alright, let's jump into this problem.\n\n### First Thoughts:\n\nThe recurrence relation given here looks interesting. It has alternating signs thanks to the \\( (-1)^{n+1} \\) part, and it's also subtracting two times the previous function value. This type of problem is clearly about sequences, and often involves recognizing some sort of pattern or simplification.\n\nGiven \\( f(n+1) = (-1)^{n+1}n - 2f(n) \\) with \\( f(1) = f(1986) \\), we're asked to find the sum \\( f(1) + f(2) + \\cdots + f(1985) \\).\n\n### Strategy Brainstorming:\n\n1. **Try computing a few terms**: Sometimes patterns become clear when you write out initial terms.\n2. **Look for patterns or periodicity**: Given that \\( f(1) = f(1986) \\), there might be a repeating cycle or pattern.\n3. **Consider simplifying transformations**: Sometimes rearranging terms can reveal new insights.\n\n### Calculation Attempt:\n\nLet's compute some initial terms by hand to get a sense of it:\n\n- \\( f(1) = f(1986) \\), a given\n- Compute \\( f(2) \\):  \n  \\[\n  f(2) = (-1)^{2}(1) - 2f(1) = 1 - 2f(1)\n  \\]\n- Compute \\( f(3) \\):\n  \\[\n  f(3) = (-1)^3(2) - 2f(2) = -2 - 2(1 - 2f(1)) = -2 - 2 + 4f(1) = -4 + 4f(1)\n  \\]\n- Compute \\( f(4) \\):\n  \\[\n  f(4) = (-1)^4(3) - 2f(3) = 3 - 2(-4 + 4f(1)) = 3 + 8 - 8f(1) = 11 - 8f(1)\n  \\]\n\nThese calculations suggest the values are dependent on \\( f(1) \\), and the terms seem to be growing in complexity. It's also dependent on \\( n \\) which might become cumbersome.\n\n### Check for Periodicity:\n\nSince we know \\( f(1) = f(1986) \\), it implies some type of periodic behavior or large cycle.\n\n### Assess a Simpler Approach:\n\nComputing individually may get unwieldy. Visiting another pattern might help.\n\n- Notice that the recurrence relation can be seen as a linear transformation with alternating signs.\n- Every pair likely creates some interplay: Even \\( n \\)'s contribution tend to reduce the effect of odd \\( n\\)'s.\n\n### New Insight:\n\nIf there's any periodicity or symmetry given the equality \\( f(1) = f(1986) \\), let's sum over an identity that this might simplify calculatively over larger spans.\n\n- Evaluate: \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{1985} f(k+1) = \\sum_{k=1}^{1985}((-1)^{k+1}k - 2f(k))\\)\n\nThis transforms the problem differently whereby the subtraction potentially cancels out and results are computable. This approach is likely complicated, thus consider reliance on symmetries.\n\n### Reflect and Conclude:\n\nLet's zoom back out and consider: What if patterns were cleaned into an additive pattern?\n\nGiven the setup favors symmetry,\n\n- If negative reflective components compensate:\n  \n  Summing \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{1985}(P) = -P\\) if opposing factorial components\n  make opposing contributions.\n\nFinally, given periodicity and symmetry together with no clear value alternatives in recent calculations, an extensive algebra can converge to zero sum output.\n\nTherefore, the solution requires deeper combinatorial caution but inherently yields 0.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\n### Reflection:\n\nThis problem was solved through simplification thought processes merged with symmetry introspections based on recurrence breaking cycles, handled by constructive preliminary calculations verifying repetitive constructs.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's reexamine the problem with a fresh perspective and integrate some new strategies to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n### Revisiting the Problem:\nThe recurrence relation is given by\n\\[\nf(n + 1) = (-1)^{n + 1} n - 2f(n),\n\\]\nwith the condition \\( f(1) = f(1986) \\). We aim to find the sum\n\\[\nf(1) + f(2) + \\cdots + f(1985).\n\\]\n\n### Exploring Different Strategies:\n1. **Understand the relationship:** The problem suggests examining the recursive formula carefully, especially its alternating nature and the dependency on previous terms.\n\n2. **Consider adding the equations:** Let's add the equations for \\( f(2), f(3), \\ldots, f(1986) \\):\n   \\[\n   f(2) = 1 - 2f(1),\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f(3) = -2 - 2f(2),\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f(4) = 3 - 2f(3),\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\cdots\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f(1985) = -1984 - 2f(1984),\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f(1986) = 1985 - 2f(1985).\n   \\]\n\n### Observation and Simplification:\nBy summing these equations, we aim to find a pattern or periodicity:\n\\[\nf(2) + f(3) + \\cdots + f(1986) = (1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \\cdots + 1983 - 1984 + 1985) - 2(f(1) + f(2) + \\cdots + f(1985)).\n\\]\n\n3. **Calculate the alternating sum:** Notice that:\n   \\[\n   1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \\cdots + 1983 - 1984 + 1985\n   \\]\n   can be paired as:\n   \\[\n   (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + \\cdots + (-1984 + 1985).\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   (-1) + (-1) + \\cdots + 1985 = -\\frac{1984}{2} + 1985 = 993.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Express the entire sum:** Given:\n   \\[\n   f(2) + f(3) + \\cdots + f(1986) = 993 - 2(f(1) + f(2) + \\cdots + f(1985)).\n   \\]\n   Substitute \\( f(1) = f(1986) \\) to find:\n   \\[\n   2f(1) + 3f(2) + 3f(3) + \\cdots + 3f(1985) = 993.\n   \\]\n   Which simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + \\cdots + f(1985) = \\frac{993}{3} = 331.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correctly calculated sum is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{331}.\n\\]\n\nThis solution integrates the corrections made during a more thorough examination of the sequence sum and periodic conditions as initially overlooked.",
