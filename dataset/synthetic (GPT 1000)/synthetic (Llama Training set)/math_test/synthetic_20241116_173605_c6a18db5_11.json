We're tasked with figuring out the smallest base \\( b \\) that allows us to do this. Seems like it has some connection to the way different bases represent numbers, like how in base 10, 47 is just \"47\", or in base 2, numbers get longer, like \"101111\".\n\nImmediate thought: If we're using base \\( b \\) and only two digits, the number can be represented as \\( ab + c \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are digits less than \\( b \\).\n\n### Brainstorming Different Strategies\n\n1. **Exploration with Examples**: Let's start by considering which numbers are expressible using two digits in smaller bases, then work up:\n   \n   - Base 2 (Binary): Two digits gives us \\( 11_2 = 3_{10} \\), maximum is \\( 11_2 \\), too small.\n   - Base 3: \\( 22_3 = 2 \\times 3 + 2 = 8 \\), upswing! But still too small...\n   - Base 4: \\( 33_4 = 3 \\times 4 + 3 = 15 \\), a bit better but not quite there.\n   - Base 5: \\( 44_5 = 4 \\times 5 + 4 = 24 \\), getting closer.\n   - Base 6: \\( 55_6 = 5 \\times 6 + 5 = 35 \\), oh so close...\n   - Base 7: \\( 66_7 = 6 \\times 7 + 6 = 48 \\), just overshot it.\n   - Base 8: \\( 56_8 = 5 \\times 8 + 6 = 46 \\), just under... adjust the digit configuration.\n   - Base 8 (adjustment): \\( 57_8 = 5 \\times 8 + 7 = 47 \\) could this be it?\n\nThe base digit calculations made me realize I should also consider combinations, like adjusting mostly the one maximally fitting digit.\n\n### Calculating for Base 7 (What Went Wrong Before!)\n\nLet's figure if there's a two-digit number in base 7 accurately fits because something felt rushed earlier before jumping to 8:\n\n- Maximum in two-digits \\( ab_7 \\) with digits 6 and 6: \n  - \\( 66_7 = 6 \\times 7 + 6 = 48 \\). Just misses range and can\u2019t form 47.\n\nAlright, makes sense why we were just out with the digit cap configuration using 7. Sticks me with 8 for deeper confirmation!\n\n### Confirming and Reflections\n\nFor base 8, wanted to test both what worked and what didn\u2019t broadly (which initially 9 seemed even steeper overhead):\n\n- The same method with the digits: \\( 57_8 = 5 \\times 8 + 7 = 47 \\).\n\nHurrah! Now, reevaluating base operation speaks right because:\n\n1. Lower bases can't fully accommodate (7 slightly overshooting) and,\n2. Increase seems generated a suitable setup via combination found indeed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the smallest whole number base \\( b \\) is **8**. It\u2019s fascinating that sometimes a step \"skipped\" could be the answer which needed an extra explorative nudge observed.\n\nThis composed steps reflect back on ensuring systematic overflow doesn't narrow potential avenues to assess less explored gaps where a solution resides.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's take another look at this problem.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Problem\n\nThe task is to express the number 47 in two digits in some base \\( b \\). I initially thought base 8 was the smallest, but let's reassess with a sharper approach and some exploration.\n\n### Revisiting Strategy\n\n1. **Considering the Expression**: We want 47 to be represented as \\( ab + c \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are digits less than \\( b \\). This requires \\( 47 < b^2 \\), as two digits in base \\( b \\) could take values up to \\( (b-1)b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1 \\).\n\n2. **Recalculating with Base Limitations**:\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{47} < b\n   \\]\n   \n   Solving this, we have that \\( b > \\sqrt{47} \\). Since \\( \\sqrt{47} \\approx 6.86 \\), the smallest integer \\( b \\) should be 7.\n\n3. **Verification in Base 7**:\n\n   To confirm, we should check if 47 can indeed be expressed with two digits in base 7:\n\n   - Convert 47 to base 7: \n     - \\( 47 \\div 7 = 6 \\) remainder \\( 5 \\)\n     - Thus, 47 in base 7 is \\( 65_7 \\).\n\n   This can be verified since:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 7 + 5 = 42 + 5 = 47\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI've confirmed my understanding and calculations \u2013 the smallest whole number base \\( b \\) that allows 47 to be expressed using just two digits is indeed **7**. It's always rewarding to revisit assumptions and discover the correct path. Thank you for the chance to correct my mistake and learn from reviewing the approach!",
