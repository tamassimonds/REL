    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The goal here is to express the given expression \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\) in its simplest form. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\nOkay, initially this looks like a problem involving nested square roots and might require some simplification tricks. It reminds me a bit of problems involving conjugates or symmetrical expressions. I'm not entirely sure where to start, but these two symmetrical expressions under the square roots signal some simplification could be possible.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n1. The expressions under the square roots are \\(\\frac{3}{4} - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) and \\(\\frac{3}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\). They look like they could relate to some identity or symmetric difference.\n2. Could try simplifying \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) to something cleaner, as \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n3. Think about squaring the entire expression to see if that helps clear the roots.\n4. Playing around with algebraic identities like difference of squares might help, maybe need to consider conjugates.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Rewriting Square Roots:**\n   - First, let's rewrite \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). Thus, the expressions become:\n      \\[ \n      \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}\n      \\]\n\n2. **Conjugate Approach:**\n   - Let's try multiplying by the conjugate:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   - This simplifies to the difference of squares:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying the Difference:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n   - Now, this shows that everything simplifies to \\(-\\sqrt{2}\\).\n   \n4. **Resolving Back:**\n   - Notice that we have:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}\\right)^2 = -\\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n\n   - Upon reflection, I notice I mismatched a step there (square roots can't yield a negative square): the actual result without squaring may indeed involve a simpler integer or rational result.\n\n5. **Re-check and Verification:**\n   - I looked over: I square the expression directly, and it simplifies further:\n     - Assume \\(x = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}\\), \\(y = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}\\)\n     - Then:\n     \\[\n     (x-y)^2 = (x^2 - y^2) = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{3}{4}+\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = -\\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n\n   - Thus, when reflectively verified, the transformation to real squares and reflection brings around to more clarity indicating instead of something straightforward like \\(-1\\).\n\n6. **Immediate Result:**\n   - The solution rests in transformations characteristic of symmetric differences. This approach when \\([x^2-y^2] = 1 \\) iteration will yield the simpler result consistent with original symmetry \\(= -1\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThrough trial and error, the solution simplifies under careful manipulation back to a rational constant. The messy middle part shows rounds about algebraic exploration. Final verification yields a confident simplified form of the expected result, the expression:\n\\[\n-1\n\\]\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution, and it's important to revisit and refine my approach to get the correct answer. Let's start by brainstorming again and carefully analyzing the expression to see where things might have gone astray and how it can be simplified correctly.\n\n### Re-Analysis and Brainstorming\nLet's first restate the problem:\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}}\n\\]\n\n#### Possible Strategies:\n1. **Rewriting and Simplifying Terms:**\n   - Simplifying \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) to \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) helped previously but was not sufficient on its own. \n   - Let's try expressing these nested roots differently or check symmetrical properties.\n\n2. **Use of Algebraic Identities:**\n   - Previously, I attempted to apply the idea of conjugates and difference of squares, which helped initially conceptualize but led to errors. Perhaps revisiting this approach more carefully could be beneficial.\n\n3. **Square the Expression:**\n   - A common technique with square roots is to square both sides to eliminate the radicals and see if that reveals simplifications.\n\n### Correct Approach and Solving\nLet's square the expression \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nUsing the identity \\((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\), we compute:\n- \\(a = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\)\n- \\(b = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\)\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{4} - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right) - 2\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{4} - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{3}{2} - 2\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{16} - \\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify the product under the square root:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{16} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{9}{16} - \\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{1}{16}\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{3}{2} - 2\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{16}}\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\nSince we know \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}} > \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4} - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\), the expression \\(x\\) is negative, thus:\n\\[\nx = \\boxed{-1}\n\\]\n\nReflecting on this, it becomes more evident that the structured application of identities and careful arithmetic allows for simplification that ultimately resolves the nested radicals and symmetry into a straightforward result and verifying confirms this conclusion is indeed correct.",
