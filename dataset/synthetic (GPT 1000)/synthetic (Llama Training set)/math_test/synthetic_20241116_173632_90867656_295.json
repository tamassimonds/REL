    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive in! \n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- First, I notice we're dealing with digits from which to form two-digit numbers. My immediate thought is that the question relates to forming specific numbers divisible by 3, using the digits $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, and $9$.\n- This reminds me of divisibility rules. I recall that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3.\n- My next thought is, how do I go about checking which combinations will form numbers that meet this criterion?\n- Do I choose any arbitrary combination, or is there a systematic way to go about this? Perhaps I need to ensure I don't miss any combinations.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Start Exploring with Pairings**\n  \nI need to form two-digit numbers such that the two digits are different. Let's list out the possible numbers we can make:\n- The first digit can be any of the digits except zero (since it's a two-digit number), so I consider placing each digit from the set $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $9$ in the tens place.\n- For each choice of the tens digit, the units place can be filled by one of the 4 remaining digits in the set.\n\nLet's try one:\n\n1. **Tens digit is 2:**\n\n   - Numbers: \\(23, 25, 27, 29\\)\n\n2. **Tens digit is 3:**\n\n   - Numbers: \\(32, 35, 37, 39\\)\n\n3. **Tens digit is 5:**\n\n   - Numbers: \\(52, 53, 57, 59\\)\n\n4. **Tens digit is 7:**\n\n   - Numbers: \\(72, 73, 75, 79\\)\n\n5. **Tens digit is 9:**\n\n   - Numbers: \\(92, 93, 95, 97\\)\n\nSo far, everything seems to be in order. I feel pretty confident that I've captured all unique pairings. Next, I'll check the divisibility.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Check Divisibility by 3**\n\nFor divisibility by 3:\n- I will calculate the sum of the digits for each two-digit number to check if it's divisible by 3.\n\n**Checking:**\n\n1. **23:** \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) (not divisible)\n2. **25:** \\(2 + 5 = 7\\) (not divisible)\n3. **27:** \\(2 + 7 = 9\\) (divisible)\n4. **29:** \\(2 + 9 = 11\\) (not divisible)\n\n5. **32:** \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) (not divisible)\n6. **35:** \\(3 + 5 = 8\\) (not divisible)\n7. **37:** \\(3 + 7 = 10\\) (not divisible)\n8. **39:** \\(3 + 9 = 12\\) (divisible)\n\n9. **52:** \\(5 + 2 = 7\\) (not divisible)\n10. **53:** \\(5 + 3 = 8\\) (not divisible)\n11. **57:** \\(5 + 7 = 12\\) (divisible)\n12. **59:** \\(5 + 9 = 14\\) (not divisible)\n\n13. **72:** \\(7 + 2 = 9\\) (divisible)\n14. **73:** \\(7 + 3 = 10\\) (not divisible)\n15. **75:** \\(7 + 5 = 12\\) (divisible)\n16. **79:** \\(7 + 9 = 16\\) (not divisible)\n\n17. **92:** \\(9 + 2 = 11\\) (not divisible)\n18. **93:** \\(9 + 3 = 12\\) (divisible)\n19. **95:** \\(9 + 5 = 14\\) (not divisible)\n20. **97:** \\(9 + 7 = 16\\) (not divisible)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOh! Definitely a relief when math checks out in terms of divisibility. Out of the possibilities, I see the numbers that are divisible by 3: \\(27, 39, 57, 72, 75, 93.\\)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion & Final Check:**\n\nCounting these numbers, I find there are 6 numbers that are divisible by 3. \n\n- 27\n- 39\n- 57\n- 72\n- 75\n- 93\n\nThus, Alice can construct **6** different two-digit numbers with the given digits that are divisible by 3.\n\nThat feels right after this thorough approach.

  "ground_truth": "For a number to be divisible by $3$, its digits must add up to be a number divisible by $3$. We can easily find that three combinations work: $2+7=9$, $5+7=12$, and $3+9=12$. Since the unit and tens digits are interchangeable (the digits will still add up to a multiple of 3), there are $3 \\cdot 2 =\\boxed{6}$ possible numbers."
