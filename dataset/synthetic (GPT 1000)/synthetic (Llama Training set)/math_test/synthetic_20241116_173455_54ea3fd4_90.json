    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, keeping in mind a natural thought process:\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see the expression `(-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k)`, it looks like a problem of simplifying by combining like terms. I've seen similar expressions where I have to identify and group terms based on their common variables or constants. \n\nHmm, this seems straightforward, but let's break it down anyway to make sure I'm not missing anything simple. I assume my goal here is to simplify the expression to its basic form.\n\n### Step-by-Step Exploration\n\n1. **Look for Like Terms**:\n   I see that we have a few terms here. Some involve the variable `k`, while others are just constant numbers. The terms `-k` and `3k` both involve `k`, so they should be grouped together. Similarly, the constants `4` and `-2` should be combined.\n\n2. **Rewriting the Expression**:\n   Let me rewrite the expression to make this clearer:\n   \\[\n   (-k) + (3k) + 4 + (-2)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the `k` Terms**:\n   Let's focus on the terms that contain `k`, which are `-k` and `3k`. \n   - When combining these, it\u2019s like adding their coefficients: \n     \\[\n     -1k + 3k = (3 - 1)k = 2k\n     \\]\n\n   Okay, that part seems right. `-k` plus `3k` should give `2k`.\n\n4. **Combine the Constant Terms**:\n   Now let's look at the constant terms `4` and `-2`.\n   - Adding those gives:\n     \\[\n     4 - 2 = 2\n     \\]\n\n   This part seems straightforward and checks out.\n\n5. **Bringing It Together**:\n   Now I just need to bring every term together: `2k` from the `k` terms and `2` from the constants.\n   - So the original expression simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     2k + 2\n     \\]\n\n### Reflect and Verify\n\nHmm, let me take a quick moment to revisit the steps and make sure there's no oversight.\n\n- Terms combined correctly? Check.\n- Like terms identified properly? Check.\n- Arithmetic on combining constants and coefficients? Looks right.\n\nI feel confident that the logical steps are sound and the operations carried out on the terms were accurate. Therefore, the simplified expression should be:\n\n\\[\n2k + 2\n\\]\n\nFeels complete! There could be alternative approaches initially, such as restructuring expressions, but this path seems to efficiently simplify the given problem.",
