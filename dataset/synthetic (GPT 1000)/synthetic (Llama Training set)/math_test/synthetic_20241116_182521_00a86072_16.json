    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem and see how we can find the sum of the \\( x \\)-coordinates of all possible positive integer solutions to the equation \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{7}\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding and Rewriting the Equation\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. We are given a reciprocal equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{7}\n\\]\n\nThis equation needs to be simplified so that we can find integer solutions for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). My instincts tell me that we should try to clear the fractions by finding a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y + x}{xy} = \\frac{1}{7}\n\\]\n\nBy cross-multiplying, we get:\n\n\\[\n7(y + x) = xy\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Equation\n\nRearranging terms gives us:\n\n\\[\nxy - 7x - 7y = 0\n\\]\n\nThis looks like a classic problem where we need to solve for integer values. Let's see if we can factor this somehow.\n\n### Step 3: Factoring the Equation\n\nThis equation doesn't immediately factor in a clear way, so let's try rewriting it by completing the square or transforming the terms:\n\n\\[\nxy - 7x - 7y + 49 = 49\n\\]\n\nRewrite the above to form a perfect square:\n\n\\[\n(x-7)(y-7) = 49\n\\]\n\nAh, this feels promising. Now, let me think\u201449 can be factored in a few ways since it is a perfect square.\n\n### Step 4: Finding Integer Solutions\n\nLet's list the factor pairs of 49. Since 49 is a perfect square, its factor pairs are:\n\n- \\((1, 49)\\)\n- \\((49, 1)\\)\n- \\((7, 7)\\)\n\nAnd since this equation is symmetric, we do not need to repeat them in reverse.\n\nGiven \\((x-7)(y-7) = 49\\), we will examine each factor pair to find possible \\((x, y)\\) pairs.\n\n#### Pair 1: (1, 49)\n\n- If \\(x - 7 = 1\\), then \\(x = 8\\).\n- Correspondingly, \\(y - 7 = 49\\), so \\(y = 56\\).\n\nAnd reversing:\n\n- If \\(x - 7 = 49\\), then \\(x = 56\\).\n- Correspondingly, \\(y - 7 = 1\\), so \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThis gives two solutions: \\((8, 56)\\) and \\((56, 8)\\).\n\n#### Pair 2: (7, 7)\n\n- If \\(x - 7 = 7\\), then \\(x = 14\\).\n- Correspondingly, \\(y - 7 = 7\\), so \\(y = 14\\).\n\nThis gives one solution: \\((14, 14)\\).\n\n### Step 5: Collecting the \\(x\\)-coordinates \n\nThe \\(x\\)-coordinates we found from the solutions are 8, 56, and 14. \n\n### Step 6: Summing the \\(x\\)-coordinates\n\nNow, let's sum these \\(x\\)-coordinates:\n\n\\[\n8 + 56 + 14 = 78\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of all \\(x\\)-coordinates is 78.\n\n### Verification\n\nTo ensure correctness, let's verify if each pair satisfies the original equation:\n\n1. For \\((8, 56)\\) and \\((56, 8)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{56} = \\frac{7}{56} + \\frac{1}{56} = \\frac{1}{7}\n   \\]\n\n2. For \\((14, 14)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{14} + \\frac{1}{14} = \\frac{2}{14} = \\frac{1}{7}\n   \\]\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the final answer is that the sum of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of all solutions is \\(\\boxed{78}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Multiplying both sides of the equation by $7xy$ yields $7y + 7x = xy$. Re-arranging and applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, it follows that $$xy - 7x - 7y + 49 = (x - 7)(y - 7) = 49.$$ Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, then $x-7$ is a positive integer factor of $49$. These factors are $1,7,49$, so $x = 8,14,56$, and their sum is $8 + 14 + 56 = \\boxed{78}$."
