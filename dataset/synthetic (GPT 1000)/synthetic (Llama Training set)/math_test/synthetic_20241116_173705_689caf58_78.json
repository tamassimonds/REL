    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this. As I look at this problem, it seems to involve figuring out percentages related to a survey conducted by a radio station. My first instinct is to focus on understanding the gender breakdown, as we're specifically asked about the percentage of males that listen to the station. Let's sum up what I see:\n\n1. **The Table's Structure**: The table is split by gender (Male, Female) and listening status (Listen, Don't Listen). We're given some numbers, but there are also gaps represented by question marks.\n\n2. **Goal**: We need to find the percentage of males who listen to the station. This boils down to determining the number of males who listen and the total number of males surveyed.\n\nOkay, so here are my initial observations:\n- We have some given data points: \n  - \"Don't Listen\" for Males is 26.\n  - \"Listen\" for Females is 58.\n  - Total who \"Don't Listen\" is 64.\n  - Total who \"Listen\" is 136.\n  - Total surveyed is 200.\n\n### First Step: Analyze the totals\nTo find the number of males surveyed, we'll use the totals:\n- Total who \"Listen\" + Total who \"Don't Listen\" = Total surveyed across both genders which is given as 200.\n\n- Calculating known totals:\n  - Total Listen = 136\n  - Total Don't Listen = 64\n  - \\(136 + 64 = 200\\) (This checks out with the total surveyed, so our given totals are consistent).\n\nNow, let's determine the total male and female population:\n- Total Female = Total surveyed - Total Male (We'll find this eventually)\n\n### Second Step: Find Missing Values\nLet's start with finding missing male values:\n- Total Males Listen (Let's label it as 'M') is unknown.\n- Total Males Don't Listen is given as 26.\n\nThe total number of males surveyed can be found by knowing that all males either listen or don't listen:\n- \\( \\text{Total Males} = \\text{Males Listen ('M')} + 26 \\)\n\n### Solving for M:\nSince we know the total number listening is part of the overall total of 136:\n- Males Listen ('M') + Females Listen (58) = 136\n- So: \\( M + 58 = 136 \\)\n  \nLet's solve for 'M':\n- \\( M = 136 - 58 = 78 \\)\n\nThis means there are 78 males who listen to the station.\n\n### Third Step: Calculate Total Males\n- Total Males = Males Listen (78) + Males Don't Listen (26)\n- Thus, Total Males = 78 + 26 = 104\n\n### Finally: Calculate Percentage of Males Listening\n- Percentage of Males Listening = (Number of Males Listening / Total Males) \u00d7 100\n- Percentage = \\( \\frac{78}{104} \\times 100 \\)\n\nLet's calculate this:\n- Percentage = \\( 0.75 \\times 100 = 75\\% \\)\n\n### Reflect and Double-Check:\nWait, that seems quite high. Let me just double-check my logic here:\n- The big picture numbers and operations line up, and the individual calculations don't seem to have errors. The idea of checking if any number seems out of place seems okay too.\n\nIn conclusion, 75% of the males surveyed listen to the station. Given our breakdown and checks, this supports that the calculations are thorough.",
