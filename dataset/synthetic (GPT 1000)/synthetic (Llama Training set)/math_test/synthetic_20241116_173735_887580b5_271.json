    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem on finding the average (mean) of the numbers 6, 8, 9, 11, and 16. The question seems straightforward, but I'll break it down step by step, ensuring I've covered all bases and checked my work like I naturally would.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst, what's the question asking for? It's asking for the average (mean) of a set of numbers. I know the formula for the mean is to sum all the numbers in the set and then divide by the count of numbers. So here, my first task is to add 6, 8, 9, 11, and 16 together, then divide by the total number of values, which is 5.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring Strategies\nThere aren\u2019t many strategies when dealing with the mean; it\u2019s quite straightforward. However, I can try breaking it down into smaller steps that I might explore:\n- Adding the numbers in pairs or groups to simplify the addition.\n- Taking a moment to double-check for any possible number I might have missed or added incorrectly.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Sum\nLet me start with the initial operations step-by-step:\n- First, I'll add the first two numbers: 6 + 8 = 14.\n- Next, I'll add the next number: 14 + 9 = 23.\n- Adding the fourth number: 23 + 11 = 34.\n- Finally, adding the last number: 34 + 16 = 50.\n\n### Step 4: Total Number of Values\nI need to confirm how many numbers there are to ensure I divide correctly. I see 5 numbers: 6, 8, 9, 11, 16.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Mean\nWith the sum of numbers, 50, and knowing there are 5 numbers, I'll calculate the mean:\n- Mean = Total sum of numbers / Total count of numbers = 50 / 5 = 10.\n\n### Step 6: Reflecting and Checking the Work\nLet me double-check:\n- First, I\u2019ll re-add the numbers to make sure the sum is correct:\n  - Quickly adding pairs again: (6 + 8 = 14), (14 + 9 = 23), (23 + 11 = 34), (34 + 16 = 50).\n- Then, I'll consider whether 10 makes sense. Given the numbers are somewhat evenly spread, with 10 near the middle, it seems plausible.\n\n### Step 7: Quick Gut Check\nI quickly think, does 10 feel right? The numbers range from single digits to mid-teens, so an average of 10 seems reasonable given these values and the arithmetic should have correctly worked out. \n\nThat checks out! The average (mean) of 6, 8, 9, 11, and 16 is indeed 10. A simple problem but a good exercise in ensuring every step is checked and rechecked.",
