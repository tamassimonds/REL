    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and try to solve it by thinking out loud, step by step. \n\n### Understanding the Problem:\nFirst, I want to make sure I understand the problem correctly. Adrien placed four CDs into four cases, and I need to find the probability that exactly two of the CDs are in the wrong cases. \n\nInitially, this might seem confusing, because if two CDs are in the wrong cases, that should mean two CDs are in the correct ones. However, in a scenario where exactly two CDs are in the wrong cases, it implies some switching of the CDs might be needed as the end result matches with partially correct placement, but only without aligning directly with just two 'right' or 'wrong'.\n\nEach CD can potentially be in any of the four cases, resulting in a permutation problem where order matters.\n\n### First Thoughts and Strategy:\n- **Approach 1**: I think this involves the concept of permutations. It sounds a lot like a problem about derangements, where none of the items is in its original position. I've done permutations before but not derangements exactly, so this feels somewhat familiar but challenging. But given we're looking for exactly two wrong places, that falls into combining correct and incorrect placements.\n\n- **Approach 2**: Another possibility could be to consider cases or scenarios. I could explore how the CDs could be arranged, maybe write them out. Though, this couldn't fully work since manually calculating with all is tedious.\n\n### Calculating Permutations:\nFirst, let's calculate the total possible arrangements. There are 4 ways to place each CD, so the total number of combinations is 4! (factorial of 4). \n\n\\[ 4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24 \\]\n\nNow, considering the definition of the problem - finding a true match for exactly two CDs means other two must also be correct, or else switch their incorrect places, as no pairs would purely two mismatches directly.\n\n### Considering Derangements:\nIn any arrangement where all items are misplaced, what's known as a derangement, none of the items can be in their original position. But here, I'm being asked for exactly randomly matched two and the others aren\u2019t entirely correct, meaning I lack a full logical derangement. Traditionally in cases such as having all as wrong, there are predetermined formulas for this.\n\n### Realizing the Issue:\n- Oh wait! If I pursue the strategy similar to full wrong placements, it\u2019s not working, thinking it doesn't just fit because having only exactly two misplaced among switching individually is not feasible because the remaining CDs that are wrong are blessings for the right match. Hmm, yep, process strikes no viable outcome like attempted single wrong moves that can't align.\n\n### Aha! Insight:\nThere\u2019s a realization that if two CDs are placed randomly as matching in their wrong places, remaining must rectify such automatically yet contradict placement immediately in a real sense. Thus, there's no direct possibility for precisely two incorrect matchings with the supposedly correct placement like original cases. \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe conclusion is that it's not possible to have exactly two CDs in the wrong cases in this context. It's like if two CDs are in correct but swapped cases, then they ultimately self-balance once checked back.\n\n### Verification:\nReflecting upon it, translating into logical symmetries delves that no permutation will yield stable only two mismatches since explanation demonstrably reclaims or reconstructs derivatively distinct arrangements ensuring misaligned positions with two part swap only feels theoretical, practically providing zero-derived solutions or placements exactly like sound.\n\nHence, the probability of exactly two CDs being in the wrong cases is \\( \\frac{0}{24} = 0 \\).\n\nThis looks right\u2014thinking over it and retracing steps grounded rationale underscores no simple possibility for solely two individual mismatches if four cases align/balance increment or decrement like this impasse beyond les possible exact counts. Nonetheless, a mindful exploration through confusion helped find decisive reasoning embodied distinctly here.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous explanation. Let's take a fresh look at the problem and correct our approach.\n\n### Revisiting the Problem:\nWe know that Adrien placed four CDs in four cases, and we need to find the probability that exactly two of the CDs are in the correct cases.\n\n### Brainstorming and Strategy:\nInitially, I had thought that having exactly two CDs in the wrong cases would automatically misplace the others, making it impossible. However, that's not quite right. Let's consider the permutations of exactly two CDs being in the correct cases:\n\n1. **Case Analysis Approach**: Let's find out how many ways we can place exactly two CDs in the right cases.\n   - Given any pair of CDs, say CDs A and B, if both are to be in the correct cases, the other two CDs, say C and D, must also be correctly placed. However, they cannot both be in correct cases because that would mean all are correct.\n   - This approach is not fruitful since it can't yield just two correct CDs while the other two are incorrect.\n\n2. **Understanding Derangements**:\n   - Let's consider this again: If two CDs are placed incorrectly, they must swap with each other to end up being correct, meaning the two other CDs would need to also swap.\n   - Actually, this logic verifies that if two are correct, the remaining two must automatically be wrong.\n\n### Identifying Valid Arrangements:\nA precise way to look at it is to choose which two CDs are correct. For instance, if CDs 1 and 2 are correctly placed, then CDs 3 and 4 must be swapped to be in their own correct positions, rather than creating a problem. This sort of permutation is an example of a specific arrangement:\n\n- We have \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\) combinations to select 2 out of 4 CDs that are correctly placed. For each correct pair, the remaining two CDs must naturally swap with each other which aligns them correctly in opposition.\n\n### Calculating the Probability:\nNow, knowing there are 6 such valid arrangements where exactly two CDs are in the correct place, out of a total of \\(4! = 24\\) possible arrangements, the probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of ways to have exactly 2 correct}}{\\text{Total number of combinations}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{6}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nIn conclusion, the correct probability that exactly two CDs are in the wrong positions (or rather, correctly set due to swap alignment) is indeed \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\\). I'm glad we re-evaluated the problem to find the correct reasoning and solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Given any pair of the 4 CDs, there is exactly one arrangement with only these two CDs in the correct cases, because each of the remaining two CDs must be in the case of the other one.  Therefore, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ arrangements of the CDs for which exactly two of the CDs are in the correct case.  The probability that one of these 6 arrangements will be chosen from among the $4!=24$ equally likely arrangements is $\\dfrac{6}{24}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}$."
