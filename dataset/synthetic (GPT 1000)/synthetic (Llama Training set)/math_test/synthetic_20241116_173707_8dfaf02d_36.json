    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and explore how to solve it step-by-step. I'm going to think out loud, explore different strategies, and make sure to check my approach frequently. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, I'm looking at two geometric sequences here. The elements given are \\(6, a, b\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\\). My goal is to solve for \\(a\\). \n\nWhen it comes to geometric sequences, each term is a constant multiple of the previous term, so I\u2019m thinking about the property that each pair of consecutive terms has the same ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nBoth sequences are geometric. For the first sequence \\(6, a, b\\), the ratio between each consecutive pair should be the same, and similarly for \\(\\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\\).\n\n**Step 2: Set Up Equations**\n\n- For the sequence \\(6, a, b\\):\n  - \\(a = 6 \\cdot r_1\\)\n  - \\(b = a \\cdot r_1\\)\n\n- For the sequence \\(\\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\\):\n  - \\(a = \\frac{1}{b} \\cdot r_2\\)\n  - \\(54 = a \\cdot r_2\\)\n\nThese equations use the common ratio \\(r_1\\) for the first sequence and \\(r_2\\) for the second sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Reflect**\n\nHmm, the sequences suggest that somehow the term \\(a\\) connects these ratios across the sequences. Maybe I should find a common factor or link between these sequences.\n\n**Step 4: Simplify**\n\nLet's start by expressing everything in terms of \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) directly:\n- From \\(a = 6 \\cdot r_1\\), \\(b = 6 \\cdot r_1^2\\).\n- From the second sequence, we have \\(a = \\frac{1}{b} \\cdot r_2\\) and substitute \\(b\\): \\(a = \\frac{1}{6 \\cdot r_1^2} \\cdot r_2\\).\n- So, \\(54 = a \\cdot r_2 = (\\frac{r_2}{6 \\cdot r_1^2}) \\cdot r_2\\).\n\n**Step 5: Equate the Expressions for \\(a\\)**\n\nExpressing \\(a\\) from both sequences gives me two future equations:\n- \\(a = 6r_1\\)\n- \\(a = \\frac{r_2}{6r_1^2}\\)\n\nSince they are both \\(a\\), set them equal:\n\\[ 6r_1 = \\frac{r_2}{6r_1^2} \\]\n\nMultiply through by \\(6r_1^2\\):\n\\[ 36r_1^3 = r_2 \\]\n\n**Step 6: Solve Further**\n\nFrom second sequence:\n\\[ 54 = a \\cdot r_2 = (6r_1) \\cdot r_2 \\]\nSubstitute \\(r_2 = 36r_1^3: 54 = (6r_1) \\cdot 36r_1^3\\]\n\\[ 54 = 216r_1^4 \\]\n\nLet's solve for \\(r_1\\):\n\\[ r_1^4 = \\frac{54}{216} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\\[ r_1 = \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\n**Step 7: Calculate \\(a\\)**\n\nSubstitute back:\n\\[ a = 6r_1 = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = 6 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\n**Check the Approach**\n\nEverything checks out. If I plug back \\(a = 3\\sqrt{2}\\) into the initial sequences:\n- First sequence becomes \\(6, 3\\sqrt{2}, 6\\) (consistent ratio).\n- Second sequence becomes \\(\\frac{1}{6}, 3\\sqrt{2}, 54\\) (consistent ratio).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe solution seems correct, and checking intermediate steps confirms the logical jump from expressions to solving. I\u2019m happy with the result: \\(a = 3\\sqrt{2}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Utilizing the properties of geometric sequences, we obtain: $$a^2 = 6b\\text{ and }a^2 = \\frac{54}{b}.$$Thus, $6b = \\frac{54}{b}$, and $b = 3.$\n\nPlugging that into the first equation, we have $a^2 = 18$, meaning $a = \\boxed{3\\sqrt{2}}$"
