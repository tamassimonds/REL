    "working_out": "Okay, let's approach this problem one step at a time, just like how I'd think it through if I were solving it myself.\n\n---\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, we have a problem about costs and savings. It looks like an investment, where upfront costs are higher, and over time, savings will recover those initial expenses. This reminds me of those break-even analyses I did, where you figure out how long it takes for savings to equal costs. Okay, let's try to break down what we know:\n\n- **Installation cost:** \\$10,000\n- **Annual maintenance cost:** \\$650\n- **Annual savings on energy bills:** \\$1200\n\n### Brainstorming\n\n1. **Quick check:** If my savings are \\$1200 each year, and the maintenance is \\$650, I'm not saving the full \\$1200. Let me calculate the net savings per year.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing it as a balance game:** Initially, we're \\$10,000 \"in the hole.\" Each year, we save money from the technology, but we also have to pay for maintenance. The equation might be something like: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Net savings per year} = \\text{Annual savings} - \\text{Annual maintenance}\n   \\]  \n\n3. **Net Savings Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net savings per year} = 1200 - 650 = 550\n   \\]\n\n   Okay, so each year, effectively, we save \\$550.\n\n4. **Finding how many years to break even:** \n   To find how many years it takes to recover the \\$10,000, I'll consider this net savings. It's basically a division of the total cost by the savings per year.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Years to recuperate costs} = \\frac{10000}{550}\n   \\]\n\n   Let's calculate that. Hmm, this division isn't straightforward; it's likely not an even number of years.\n\n### Doing the Math\n\n- \\(\\frac{10000}{550} \\approx 18.18\\).\n\n  So, it will take **just over 18 years** to fully recover the initial \\$10,000 cost.\n\n5. **Whole Years Interpretation:** \n\n   Since the question asks for \"whole years,\" we can't consider 18.18 as literally 18 years because that's not enough to recuperate the full amount. Once 18 years pass, we'll still be a little short, so it will actually take **19 years** to completely cover the costs, because I have to wait until the start of the 19th year to say I've officially offset the full initial investment.\n\n  \n### Final Check\n\nLet me verify the math by thinking through:\n\n- After 18 years, \\(18 \\times 550 = 9900\\). I'm just \\$100 short. \n- During the 19th year, even just a couple more months would put me over the top by an extra \\$100, fully recouping the \\$10,000.\n\nEverything checks out. I feel confident the answer should be 19 whole years. \n\n---\n\nOkay, I feel good about this answer. Admittedly, there\u2019s an interesting time investment here, considering it's almost two decades before recouping costs, but that's typical for some green technologies. Done!",

  "ground_truth": "We look for the least number of years $n$ it takes for the savings to be greater than or equal to the costs. \\begin{align*}\n1200n&\\ge10,000+650n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n550n&\\ge10,000\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nn&\\ge\\frac{10,000}{550}=18.\\overline{18}\n\\end{align*}The smallest integer greater than $18.\\overline{18}$ is 19, so it will take $\\boxed{19}$ years to recuperate the costs."
