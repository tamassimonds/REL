    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem where we want to find the probability that the product \\(a \\cdot b\\) is positive, given certain ranges for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\n### Step 1: Understand the Given Information\nWe have two real numbers, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), with the constraints:\n- \\(-3 \\leq a \\leq 1\\)\n- \\(-2 \\leq b \\leq 4\\)\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the product \\(a \\cdot b\\) is positive. As a product is positive either when both numbers are positive or both are negative, our task involves finding where both conditions hold within the specified ranges.\n\n### Step 2: Visualize the Constraints\nAt a glance, this problem could be visualized as a rectangle on the coordinate plane with \\(a\\) as the x-axis and \\(b\\) as the y-axis, covering the areas:\n- Horizontally: from \\(-3\\) to \\(1\\)\n- Vertically: from \\(-2\\) to \\(4\\)\n\nLet's try dividing this into different regions to examine when the product is positive.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Positive Product Regions\nConsider:\n1. **Both Positive:**\n   - \\(a > 0\\) and \\(b > 0\\). For \\(a\\), this means \\(0 < a \\leq 1\\); for \\(b\\), \\(0 < b \\leq 4\\).\n   \n2. **Both Negative:**\n   - \\(a < 0\\) and \\(b < 0\\). For \\(a\\), this means \\(-3 \\leq a < 0\\); for \\(b\\), \\(-2 \\leq b < 0\\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Areas of Each Region\nThe total area of the rectangular space defined by \\(-3 \\leq a \\leq 1\\) and \\(-2 \\leq b \\leq 4\\) is:\n- Width: \\(1 - (-3) = 4\\)\n- Height: \\(4 - (-2) = 6\\)\n- Total area = \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\).\n\n#### 4.1: Area where both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are Positive:\n- Width: \\(1 - 0 = 1\\)\n- Height: \\(4 - 0 = 4\\)\n- Area = \\(1 \\times 4 = 4\\).\n\n#### 4.2: Area where both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are Negative:\n- Width: \\(0 - (-3) = 3\\)\n- Height: \\(0 - (-2) = 2\\)\n- Area = \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n\n### Step 5: Combine Positive Product Sections\n- The total area where \\(a \\cdot b > 0\\) is \\(4 + 6 = 10\\).\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Probability\nThe probability is the ratio of the positive area to the total area:\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Area where } a \\cdot b > 0}{\\text{Total area}} = \\frac{10}{24} = \\frac{5}{12}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Reflect and Verify\nThe approach seems reasonable, as we\u2019ve accounted for both cases where the product is positive. All calculations align logically with our goal. Thus the probability that the product \\(a \\cdot b\\) is positive is \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\).\n\nSo, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The probability that both $a$ and $b$ are positive is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{6}$. The probability that $a$ and $b$ are both negative is $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{1}{4}$.  Since $ab$ is positive if and only if one of these two events occur, the probability that $ab$ is positive is $\\dfrac{1}{6}+\\dfrac{1}{4}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{12}}$.
