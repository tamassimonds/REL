    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving the problem step-by-step. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\nThe problem asks for the value of \\(6 + (8 \\div 2)\\). At first glance, this looks like a basic arithmetic problem that involves addition and division. My first thought is, \u201cThis looks straightforward, but I need to be mindful of the order of operations.\u201d\n\n**Order of Operations:**\nThe order of operations is fundamental in mathematics to ensure we solve parts of an expression in the right sequence. The common rule to follow is PEMDAS/BODMAS:\n- Parentheses/Brackets \n- Exponents/Orders\n- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\n- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nGiven the expression \\(6 + (8 \\div 2)\\), I need to decide which operation to execute first.\n\n**Analyzing the Expression:**\nThe parentheses indicate that the division inside \\(8 \\div 2\\) should be carried out first. This confines the expression within the parentheses, suggesting that it needs resolution before any other operations are performed.\n\n**Performing the Division:**\nCalculating \\(8 \\div 2\\):\n- This simplifies to 4 because dividing eight by two results in four.\n\nSo, the expression now looks like this: \\(6 + 4\\).\n\n**Performing the Addition:**\nNext, I add the result from the division, which is 4, to 6:\n- So, \\(6 + 4 = 10\\).\n\n**First Check:**\n- The problem involves basic arithmetic operations, and following PEMDAS, I\u2019m confident that I've applied the right approach.\n- Re-evaluating, \\(8 \\div 2 = 4\\) and then adding 6 gives us 10. This checks out with our standard approach to such problems.\n\n**Reflecting:**\nI realize this problem was a straightforward application of order of operations. This wasn't one that required testing multiple strategies, but more a case of methodically applying PEMDAS/BODMAS.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe final value of \\(6 + (8 \\div 2)\\) is 10. This solution seems correct based on following the mathematical order of operations closely. The answer makes logical sense and fits with my initial approach. \n\nThese types of checks are integral to ensuring solutions are robust and not just superficially correct. This problem is consistent with arithmetic norms and provides no surprise elements to challenge assumptions. \n\nThus, I'm confident that 10 is the right answer.",
