    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving the problem of finding the area of a square whose side length is equal to the radius of a circle with a circumference of \\(12\\pi\\) units. \n\n**First Impressions and Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I notice it involves understanding a circle's properties as well as those of a square. There's something familiar about using the circumference to find the radius, which will then help find the side length of the square. This should, in turn, lead to calculating the area of the square.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding Circumference and Radius**\n\nSince the circle has a circumference, \\( C = 12\\pi \\), this immediately brings the formula \\( C = 2\\pi r \\) to mind, where \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. To find the radius \\( r \\), I'll need to rearrange the formula:\n\n\\[ C = 2\\pi r \\]\n\\[ 12\\pi = 2\\pi r \\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\( 2\\pi \\) to isolate \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{12\\pi}{2\\pi} \\]\n\nOkay, let me think about this division: The \\(\\pi\\) terms cancel out, leaving\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{12}{2} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ r = 6 \\]\n\nThat feels right, just cancel out the \\(\\pi\\) and simplify the fraction. Up until now, I\u2019m just applying known circle formulas, so everything seems consistent.\n\n**Step 2: Relating Radius to Square\u2019s Side Length**\n\nThe problem states that the sides of the square are the same length as the radius of the circle. Therefore, each side of the square is also \\( 6 \\) units long. So far:\n\n- Circle radius = \\( 6 \\) units\n- Square side length = \\( 6 \\) units\n\nThis alignment makes logical sense, since the square naturally inherits the radius length as its side length.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Area of the Square**\n\nThe formula for the area \\( A \\) of a square with side length \\( s \\) is \\( A = s^2 \\). Inserting our known side length:\n\n\\[ A = 6^2 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 36 \\]\n\nIt just needs a quick double-check: The side length is definitely 6, so squaring that should indeed give 36. Let's pause and consider: The process flowed logically\u2014went from circumference to radius to side length, and then to area.\n\n**Verification and Reflection:**\n\nLet\u2019s ensure everything aligns: \n- The problem started with the circle\u2019s circumference, found the equivalent radius using the circumference formula, checked if simplifying was done correctly, which confirms the radius as 6.\n- The square\u2019s sides matched the radius as expected, and computing the area through basic squaring yielded an expected result.\n\nEverything seems logically sequential, and the derived area of the square is \\( 36 \\) square units. That number resonated through logical calculations and corroborates with expected methods. The solution seems robust, definitely in line with typical geometry I\u2019m familiar with.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter double-checking all steps and reviewing the logical consistency throughout, the final confirmed area of the square is \\( 36 \\) square units.",

  "ground_truth": "$C=2\\pi r$, so $12\\pi=2\\pi r$. Thus, $r=6$. The area of a square with side length 6 is $6^2=\\boxed{36} \\text{ sq units}$."
