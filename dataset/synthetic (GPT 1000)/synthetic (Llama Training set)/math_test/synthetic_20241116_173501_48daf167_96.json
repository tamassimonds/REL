    "working_out": "Alright, let's start tackling this problem from the beginning. The main challenge is to find the integer \\( n \\) such that \\( \\cos n^\\circ = \\cos 568^\\circ \\) and \\( 0 \\leq n \\leq 180 \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOk, this reminds me of angle measures and periodicity of trigonometric functions. I know that the cosine function is periodic with a period of \\(360^\\circ\\). This means that for any angle \\( \\theta \\), \\(\\cos \\theta = \\cos (\\theta + 360^\\circ k)\\) for any integer \\( k \\).\n\n**Step 1: Use the properties of cosine.**\n\nLet's use the periodicity to find an equivalent angle between \\( 0^\\circ \\) and \\( 360^\\circ \\) first. Since \\( \\cos(568^\\circ) = \\cos(568^\\circ - 360^\\circ) \\), let's compute:\n\n\\[ 568^\\circ - 360^\\circ = 208^\\circ. \\]\n\nSo, \\(\\cos 568^\\circ = \\cos 208^\\circ\\). But \\( 208^\\circ \\) is still outside the desired range \\( [0^\\circ, 180^\\circ] \\). Ok, let\u2019s try reducing it further.\n\n**Step 2: Find an equivalent angle within \\( [0^\\circ, 180^\\circ] \\).**\n\nI know that \\( \\cos \\theta = \\cos(360^\\circ - \\theta) \\). So let's try using it here:\n\nCalculate:\n\\[ 360^\\circ - 208^\\circ = 152^\\circ. \\]\n\nNow, \\( \\cos 208^\\circ = \\cos 152^\\circ \\).\n\nFinally, \\( 152^\\circ \\) is within the desired range of \\( [0^\\circ, 180^\\circ] \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s verify this by considering the symmetry property of cosine: \n\nUsing \\(\\cos \\theta = \\cos(360^\\circ - \\theta)\\),  I started by converting \\( 568^\\circ \\) as \\( 208^\\circ\\) and then converting it into its symmetric equivalent \\( 152^\\circ\\).\n\nQuick double-check: \n\n\\[\n360^\\circ - (568^\\circ - 360^\\circ) = 360^\\circ - 208^\\circ = 152^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that my calculations were correct. \n\nNow, reflecting on this approach a bit, it feels like we used properties of symmetry and periodicity effectively to simplify a fairly straightforward cosine periodicity problem. \n\nGiven that \\( 152^\\circ \\) is within the range \\( 0 \\leq n \\leq 180 \\), the final answer should be:\n\n\\[ n = 152. \\]\n\nGreat, this seems to all check out. The approach feels right, and calculations match the logic used. The problem is solved!",

  "ground_truth": "Since the cosine function has period $360^\\circ,$\n\\[\\cos 568^\\circ = \\cos (568^\\circ - 2 \\cdot 360^\\circ) = \\cos (-152^\\circ).\\]And since the cosine function is even, $\\cos (-152^\\circ) = \\cos 152^\\circ,$ so $n = \\boxed{152}.$"
