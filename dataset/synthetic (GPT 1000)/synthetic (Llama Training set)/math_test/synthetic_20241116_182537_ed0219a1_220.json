    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We need to find the sum of all values of \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 0 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst, I'm looking at the piecewise function given:\n\\[ \nf(x) = \n\\begin{cases} \n2x + 1 & \\text{if } x \\leq 3, \\\\\n8 - 4x & \\text{if } x > 3.\n\\end{cases} \n\\]\nThe function has two different forms based on the value of \\( x \\). Essentially, we need to find \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 0 \\) for both pieces of the function, because \\( x \\) could be in either category.\n\n### Analyzing Each Case\n\n**Case 1: \\( x \\leq 3 \\)**\nThe function is \\( 2x + 1 \\). Setting \\( f(x) = 0 \\), we get:\n\\[ \n2x + 1 = 0 \n\\]\nNow, let's solve it:\n1. Subtract 1 from both sides to get:\n   \\[ \n   2x = -1 \n   \\]\n2. Divide by 2:\n   \\[ \n   x = -\\frac{1}{2} \n   \\]\n\nThis value, \\( x = -\\frac{1}{2} \\), satisfies \\( x \\leq 3 \\). So, this is indeed one solution for \\( f(x) = 0 \\).\n\n**Case 2: \\( x > 3 \\)**\nThe function is \\( 8 - 4x \\). Setting \\( f(x) = 0 \\), we get:\n\\[ \n8 - 4x = 0 \n\\]\nLet's solve this equation:\n1. Subtract 8 from both sides to get:\n   \\[ \n   -4x = -8 \n   \\]\n2. Divide by -4:\n   \\[ \n   x = 2 \n   \\]\n\nBut wait, \\( x = 2 \\) does not satisfy \\( x > 3 \\). So there's actually no valid \\( x \\) from this case.\n\n### Conclusion\nHaving considered both cases, the only valid solution is \\( x = -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n### Final Thoughts and Sum\nSince \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\) is the only solution, the sum of all values of \\( x \\) for which \\( f(x) = 0 \\) is just:\n\\[ \n-\\frac{1}{2} \n\\]\n\nChecking this logic again: I looked at each part separately, applied the conditions given in the piecewise function, and verified if the solutions fall within the correct intervals. Everything appears correct and consistent with the setup of the problem. Therefore, the answer is indeed \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We solve the equation $f(x) = 0$ on the domains $x \\le 3$ and $x > 3.$\n\nIf $x \\le 3,$ then $f(x) = 2x + 1,$ so we want to solve $2x + 1 = 0.$ The solution is $x = -1/2,$ which satisfies $x \\le 3.$\n\nIf $x > 3,$ then $f(x) = 8 - 4x,$ so we want to solve $8 - 4x = 0.$ The solution is $x = 2,$ but this value does not satisfy $x > 3.$\n\nTherefore, the only solution is $x = \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}.$"
