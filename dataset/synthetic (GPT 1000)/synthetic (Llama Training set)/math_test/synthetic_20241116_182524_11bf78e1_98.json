    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I'm thinking, \"This looks like one of those classic problems where you have to rearrange numbers to meet a specific condition.\" It's immediately striking that the goal here is to form the largest number using each digit exactly once and still have it be a multiple of 4. Sounds tricky, but interesting!\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\n- We have the digits 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n- We need to use each digit once to form a six-digit number.\n- This number must be the largest possible and a multiple of 4.\n\n#### Initial Brainstorming\n\nTo review the conditions for numbers divisible by 4, we note:\n- A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4.\n\nGiven this, I'm thinking: \"Alright, it looks like I need to focus initially on forming the largest ending pair that's divisible by 4 and then work backward to ensure the entire number is large.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Exploration\n\n1. **Think about the divisibility by 4:**\n   - The potential pairings for the last two digits using the available numbers could be: 36, 64, 76, 84, 96, etc.\n   - We can immediately discard combinations like 34 or 78 because they don\u2019t satisfy divisibility by 4.\n\n2. **Checking feasible options:**\n   - Let me list down possible pairs that might work: \n     - 76 (since 76/4 = 19) \n     - 36 (since 36/4 = 9)\n     - 96 (since 96/4 = 24)\n   - These pairs need to maintain the largest possible number at the start, so I\u2019ll rethink using the largest non-tens digits first.\n\n3. **Creating the largest number:**\n   - Starting with 96 as an end pair (since 96 is divisible by 4 and quite high), I\u2019d aim to place larger numbers at the beginning.\n   - Remaining numbers are 3, 4, 7, 8.\n   - Leading with the largest possible numbers, let's try: 874396.\n\n4. **Verify and Reflect:**\n   - Is 874396 divisible by 4? Check the last two digits (96). Yes, it is.\n   - Reassure myself that this is the largest because it uses the largest starting digits available before 96.\n\n5. **Check Alternate Configurations:**\n   - In case my initial option wasn't best, I should check using the next largest pair, 76.\n   - This would potentially lead to numbers like 986734 or similar, but clearly, 874396 is larger when comparing the options by each digit's value in descending order.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter exploring these pathways, \"Oh wait, I believe my highest number is actually correct!\" By prioritizing larger leading digits while maintaining the divisibility condition, I landed on 874396, which is an optimal solution for the largest possible six-digit number that fits all the criteria.\n\n**Final Answer:** 874396\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's re-evaluate our approach and incorporate some new strategies to find the correct answer.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Problem\n\nWe are tasked with forming the largest six-digit number using each of the digits 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 once, ensuring that this number is a multiple of 4. To do so, we must correctly utilize the rule for divisibility by 4: the last two digits of the number must themselves form a number divisible by 4.\n\n### Digging Deeper: Identifying the Problem\n\nPreviously, I mistakenly placed 96 as my final two digits and didn't critically evaluate other configurations thoroughly. So, let's re-explore this with fresh eyes and see if there's a larger combination.\n\n### Exploring Alternatives\n\n1. **Identify all possible pairs that satisfy divisibility by 4:**\n   - Reviewing our two-digit combinations, we have 36, 64, 76, 84, 96.\n\n2. **Re-focus on forming the largest possible number:**\n   - By looking at these pairs, I realized 36 is indeed smaller, but that gives us more freedom to place larger digits up front.\n   - Starting from the largest remaining digits: 9, 8, 7, 4. Thus, let me try forming the number with these:\n     - Using 36 as the final two digits, the number becomes 987436. \n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - Just to be certain, I verify that 36 is divisible by 4.\n   - Checking the entire number: 987436 is indeed greater than my previous attempt, and it meets all the conditions.\n\n### Confirmation and Reflection\n\nBy checking various options and focusing on maximizing the leading digits, I've verified the correct solution: **987436**. Taking a systematic approach to rearranging the digits and verifying each step gave me confidence in this solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThrough reflection and strategic re-evaluation, incorporating logical checks at each step, I arrived at 987436 as the largest possible number using these digits that is also a multiple of 4. I'm glad to have corrected my initial oversight and found a more optimal configuration.",

  "ground_truth": "Divisibility by 4 depends only on the last two digits, since 100 is divisible by 4.  Therefore, to form the largest possible multiple of 4, we must use the smallest pair of digits which form a multiple of 4 as the last two digits and place the remaining digits in descending order in the first four positions.  Neither 43 nor 34 is a multiple of 4, but the next smallest pair of digits does form a multiple of 4, namely 36.  Therefore, the smallest multiple of 4 using the given digits is $\\boxed{987,\\!436}$."
