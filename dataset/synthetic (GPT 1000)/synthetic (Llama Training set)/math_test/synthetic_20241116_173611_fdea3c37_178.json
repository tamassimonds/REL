    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. Here\u2019s what we're working with:\n\nWe have the function \\( f(x) = 4x^7 + x^5 + 3x^2 - 2x + c \\) and need to find the value of \\( c \\) such that \\( f(-1) = 0 \\).\n\n### First Impressions\n\n- **Initial Thoughts:** This is a polynomial function of multiple terms, looking for when it equals zero at a specific point \\( x = -1 \\). This seems like it boils down to substitution and solving an equation. \n\n- **Recognizing Patterns:** This resembles plugging into the function to find a specific value \u2013 something that should be straightforward. It's just evaluating a polynomial and setting it to zero, then solving for \\( c \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Substitution:** First, let's substitute \\( x = -1 \\) into the given function:\n\n   \\[\n   f(-1) = 4(-1)^7 + (-1)^5 + 3(-1)^2 - 2(-1) + c\n   \\]\n\n2. **Evaluating Powers of -1:**\n  \n   - \\( (-1)^7 = -1 \\)\n   - \\( (-1)^5 = -1 \\)\n   - \\( (-1)^2 = 1 \\)\n\n3. **Plug Values Back into the Equation:**\n\n   \\[\n   f(-1) = 4(-1) + (-1) + 3(1) - 2(-1) + c\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying each term gives:\n\n   - \\( 4(-1) = -4 \\)\n   - \\( (-1) = -1 \\)\n   - \\( 3(1) = 3 \\)\n   - \\( -2(-1) = 2 \\)\n\n4. **Combine the Terms:**\n\n   \\[\n   f(-1) = -4 - 1 + 3 + 2 + c = 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying:**\n\n   \\[\n   -4 - 1 = -5\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   -5 + 3 = -2\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   -2 + 2 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   0 + c = 0\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( c \\):**\n\n   Since \\( c \\) remains, \\( 0 + c = 0 \\), thus \\( c = 0 \\).\n\n### Verification and Reflection\n\n- **Does This Seem Right?** Let's reflect. I substituted properly into the function, used arithmetic correctly, and logically reached \\( c = 0 \\).\n\n- **Checking Intuition:** The strategy was correct: converting the problem into recognizing \\( f(x) \\) being zero at a specific point simplifies the complexity considerably. Seems coherent with typical polynomial evaluations I've done before.\n\n- **Recheck Calculations:** The math checks out. Evaluating \\( f(-1) \\) term-by-term showed no errors in calculations.\n\n- **Conclusion:** It seems like everything leads to \\( c = 0 \\), and there is no missed insight or logical error.\n\n### Outcome\n\nHence, the value of \\( c \\) for which \\( f(-1) = 0 \\) is indeed \\( c = 0 \\). No need to try a different approach since initial calculations support this solution thoroughly.",
