    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem: computing \\(\\dbinom{12}{9}\\).\n\n### First Thoughts:\n\nOkay, so at first glance, this looks like a typical combinations problem, where we're trying to figure out how many ways we can choose 9 items from a total of 12 items. My brain is going, \"Hmm, this isn't too unfamiliar. I remember the binomial coefficient formula: \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\).\" \n\nBut wait, sometimes simplifying this expression upfront by recognizing properties of combinations can save some time. Let me see if anything pops out here. \n\n### Simplification Insight:\n\nI realize that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dbinom{n}{n-k}\\). Oh, right! Because choosing 9 out of 12 is the same as leaving out 3, or choosing 3 from 12. So, \\(\\dbinom{12}{9} = \\dbinom{12}{3}\\). This might be easier to calculate since 3 is smaller than 9. Nice insight!\n\n### Calculating:\n\nAlright, let's consider calculating \\(\\dbinom{12}{3}\\):\n\n1. **Formula Application:**\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{12}{3} = \\frac{12!}{3!(12-3)!} = \\frac{12!}{3! \\times 9!}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Break it down:**\n   I need to calculate \\(12!\\), but wait, I don't need the whole \\(12!\\) because the \\(9!\\) will cancel out most of it. Let's write out just enough of the factorials to simplify:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9!}{3! \\times 9!}\n   \\]\n\n   See, the \\(9!\\)s cancel each other. That's something I nearly forgot \u2013 glad I remembered!\n\n3. **Simplify further:**\n   Now I'm left with:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3!}\n   \\]\n\n   And 3! is 6. Breaking it down:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{6}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Do the math:**\n\n   - Calculate the numerator: \\(12 \\times 11 = 132\\)\n   - Multiply by 10: \\(132 \\times 10 = 1320\\)\n   - Divide by 6: \\(1320 \\div 6 = 220\\)\n\n### Reflections and Checks:\n\nWait, let's make sure this feels right. Choosing 3 items from 12 instead of calculating for 9 seemed like a shortcut, but let\u2019s double-check:\n\n- If I were to compute the original \\(\\dbinom{12}{9} = \\frac{12!}{9! \\times 3!}\\), it would break down in the exact same way: \\( \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3!} \\).\n  \nYes, everything checks out. I'm feeling pretty confident about this calculation. The number 220 doesn't seem too big or too small given our problem constraints, which is a comforting final check.\n\nSo, the final answer to \\(\\dbinom{12}{9}\\) is \\(\\boxed{220}\\). Perfect!",
