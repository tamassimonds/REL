    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nFirst look at the problem: The words \"total cost,\" \"rent,\" and \"electricity\" stand out to me. It sounds like we're working with two main components: a fixed cost (rent) and a variable cost (electricity based on kilowatt-hours).\n\n- **Rent:** The rent is straightforward, it's a flat $\\$5,000$ per month.\n- **Electricity:** The cost is $1.45 per kilowatt-hour, and we need to find out how many kilowatt-hours were used.\n\nWe're given the combined cost of rent and electricity, which is $\\$16,520.25$ for January. Now, we need to determine how many kilowatt-hours of electricity add up to this total when combined with the rent.\n\n### Brainstorming Possible Strategies\n\n1. **Set up an equation:** The total cost is a sum of rent and electricity costs. I could set up an equation to represent this.\n   \n2. **Explore trial and error:** Since the electricity cost per kilowatt-hour is known, I could try different values for kilowatt-hours to see which matches the total cost. But this feels like it might be inefficient.\n\n3. **Breakdown the total cost:** Subtract the flat rent from the total cost to see what's left for electricity.\n\nGiven these strategies, the equation approach seems the most straightforward for structured calculation:\n\n### Setting Up the Equation\n\nI\u2019ll start with the equation:\n \n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Rent} + \\text{Electric Cost} \\]\n\nHere, \\( \\text{Electric Cost} = (\\text{Number of kilowatt-hours}) \\times 1.45 \\).\n\nBreaking it down with the given numbers:\n\n\\[ 16520.25 = 5000 + ( \\text{kilowatt-hours} \\times 1.45 ) \\]\n\nOkay, with this equation, I can solve for the kilowatt-hours used.\n\n### Solving the Equation\n\n#### Step 1: Isolate the Electric Cost\n\nSubtract the rent from the total cost to find how much was spent on electricity:\n\n\\[ 16520.25 - 5000 = 11520.25 \\]\n\n#### Step 2: Calculate Kilowatt-Hours\n\nThe electricity cost of $11,520.25 is the total cost for the electricity used in kilowatt-hours at $1.45 per kWh. So:\n\n\\[ \\text{kilowatt-hours} = \\frac{11520.25}{1.45} \\]\n\nLet me do the calculation:\n\n\\[ \\text{kilowatt-hours} = \\frac{11520.25}{1.45} \\approx 7945 \\]\n\n### Quick Check\n\nDoes this make sense? \n\n- By quickly multiplying \\( 7945 \\) kilowatt-hours by $1.45, I need it to total approximately $11,520.25.\n  \nLet's check it:\n\n\\[ 7945 \\times 1.45 = 11520.25 \\]\n\nThis calculation is correct!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo, the XYZ company used approximately \\( 7945 \\) kilowatt-hours of electricity in January. \n\nReflecting on the entire process: I started with understanding the fixed and variable components of the cost. Using a systematic approach with equations helped me find the solution efficiently. Breaking down the steps ensured I didn't miss anything, and the calculations checked out perfectly. This method worked well for the information given!",

  "ground_truth": "If $x$ is the number of kilowatt-hours of power that the company used in January, then the company paid $5000+1.45x$ dollars for that month.  Setting $5000+1.45x=16520.25,$ we find $x=(16520.25-5000)/1.45=\\boxed{7945}$."
