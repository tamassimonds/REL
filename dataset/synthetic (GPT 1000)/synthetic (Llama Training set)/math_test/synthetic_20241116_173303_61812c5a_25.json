    "working_out": "First, let's really understand the problem. We're asked to compute \\((\\sqrt{97969})^2\\). The question looks straightforward because squaring a square root should cancel each other out, leaving us with the original number.\n\n### Brainstorming Approaches\n\n1. **Direct Computation**: \n   - The expression \\((\\sqrt{97969})^2\\) should simplify directly to \\(97969\\). This approach seems the most straightforward because mathematically, \\((\\sqrt{x})^2 = x\\).\n\n2. **Break into Smaller Parts**: \n   - Alternatively, we could aim to simplify \\(\\sqrt{97969}\\) first and then square it. But, actually simplifying the square root would be a bit more complex unless it's a perfect square.\n\n3. **Check if Perfect Square**:\n   - Verify if 97969 is a perfect square, which would make \\(\\sqrt{97969}\\) a whole number. This would both verify our direct computation and satisfy my curiosity if it holds some mathematical property.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Direct Computation**:\n   - Start with \\[(\\sqrt{97969})^2\\]. \n   - By definition of square roots and squaring, this equals to 97969 directly.\n  \n2. **Verify Perfect Square**:\n   - Let's see if 97969 is a perfect square by approximating its square root. \n   - Consider some approximation:\n     - The number 97969 is close to 98000, which is roughly between \\(300^2 = 90000\\) and \\(320^2 = 102400\\).\n     - Check the numbers closer: \\(310^2 = 96100\\) and \\(315^2 = 99225\\).\n     - Let's try \\(313\\): \n       - Compute \\(313^2\\): \n         - \\(313 \\times 313 = 313 \\times (300 + 13)\\)\n         - \\(= 313 \\times 300 + 313 \\times 13\\)\n         - \\(= 93900 + 4069\\) (calculated estimate)\n         - Computing more precisely:\n           - \\(313 \\times 10 = 3130\\) and \\(313 \\times 3 = 939\\) \n           - \\(313 \\times 13 = 4079\\)\n           - \\(93900 + 4079 = 97969\\)\n   - Oh! Perfect, 97969 is exactly \\(313^2\\).\n\n3. **Double-Check**:\n   - Reflecting back on our direct computation: since \\(\\sqrt{97969} = 313\\), squaring it indeed gives us 97969.\n   - My initial assumption was correct: \\((\\sqrt{97969})^2 = 97969\\).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nEverything checks out - our initial understanding that the square of a square root returns the original number holds firmly. The computation along the way verified that 97969 was indeed a perfect square, being \\(313^2\\). The answer to the problem is \\(\\boxed{97969}\\).\n\n---\n\nOverall, being cautious and verifying assumptions helped ensure correctness. While the problem seemed simple, checking if numbers are perfect squares and computing with approximations were informative exercises in number sense.",
