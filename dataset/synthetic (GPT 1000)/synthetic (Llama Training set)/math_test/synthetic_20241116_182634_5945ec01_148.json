    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\n- When I see the problem $\\log_3 81$, I immediately think about the definition of a logarithm. Essentially, it's asking: \"What power must 3 be raised to, in order to get 81?\" \n- For this type of problem, a common approach is to check if 81 is a power of 3. But I don't remember if there\u2019s an exact power of 3 that gives us 81. I could explore this first.\n\nAttempting a straightforward approach:\n\n1. I know: \n   \\[\n   3^1 = 3 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3^2 = 9 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3^3 = 27 \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3^4 = 81 \n   \\]\n\n- Oh! This progression makes me realize that $3^4 = 81$. Therefore, $\\log_3 81 = 4$.\n\nQuick check:\n\n- Let\u2019s verify that $3^4$ really is 81. \n  - \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\)\n  - \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\)\n  - \\(27 \\times 3 = 81\\): Yes, this confirms that $3^4$ is indeed 81.\n  \nReflecting on my approach:\n\n- The direct approach worked well here since 81 could be expressed exactly as a power of 3. I didn\u2019t need to explore other methods such as using properties of logarithms or numerical approximation techniques, as this problem was straightforward.\n\nOverall methodology:\n\n- My exploration began with checking powers of 3 systematically, moving from lower to higher, and confirmed when 3 raised to the power of 4 equaled 81.\n- This problem reminded me of the simplicity sometimes lost in overthinking. A step-by-step methodical check worked best here.\n\nFinal answer: \n\n- Therefore, \\(\\log_3 81 = 4\\).",
