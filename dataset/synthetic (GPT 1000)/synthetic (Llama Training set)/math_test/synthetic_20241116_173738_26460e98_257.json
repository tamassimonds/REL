    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with a step-by-step approach. Here's how I'm going to think about it:\n\n### First Impressions and Brainstorming\n\n- **Initial understanding:** We need to find the largest number \\( k \\) less than 1000 such that when divided by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, it leaves a remainder of 1. This sounds like a problem involving modular arithmetic.\n\n- **Quick thought:** This looks similar to solving a system of congruences. The remainder 1 requirement suggests each condition can be written as \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n} \\) for \\( n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \\).\n\n- **Strategy Considerations:** \n  - If \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n} \\) for multiple \\( n \\), perhaps \\( k - 1 \\) is a common multiple (specifically, a least common multiple) of these.\n  - I remember that sometimes in problems like these, the Chinese Remainder Theorem might be useful, but since the remainders are all the same, we're essentially looking for an LCM-based approach.\n\n### Step 1: Expressing the Condition\n\nFirst, let's express the condition mathematically:\n- \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\)\n- \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\)\n- \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\)\n- \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6} \\)\n- \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nThis implies that \\( k - 1 \\) must be divisible by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. In other words, \\( k - 1 \\) is a common multiple of these numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM)\n\n- **Focus:** Calculate the LCM of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\nTo find the LCM, include the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of any of the numbers:\n\n- Primes and their highest powers:\n  - 3: \\( 3^1 \\)\n  - 4: \\( 2^2 \\)\n  - 5: \\( 5^1 \\)\n  - 6: \\( 2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\)\n  - 7: \\( 7^1 \\)\n\n- **Calculating LCM:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{LCM} = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 7^1 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 12 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 60 \\cdot 7 = 420\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number \\( k \\)\n\n- We want \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{420} \\), since \\(k - 1\\) should be a multiple of 420.\n- Therefore, \\( k = 420n + 1 \\) for some integer \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 4: Maximize \\( k \\) under the Given Constraint\n\n- We need \\( k < 1000 \\).\n\nLet's solve for the largest \\( n \\):\n\\[\n420n + 1 < 1000\n\\]\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\\[\n420n < 999\n\\]\n\nDivide by 420:\n\\[\nn < \\frac{999}{420} \\approx 2.38\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest integer \\( n \\) is 2.\n\n- **Calculate \\( k \\):**\n  \\[\n  k = 420 \\times 2 + 1 = 841\n  \\]\n\n### Double-Check My Work\n\n1. **Recalculate LCM if necessary:** The LCM calculation seems correct (factors and steps rechecked).\n2. **Verify \\( k \\) divisibility and condition:** \n   - \\( k = 841 \\)\n   - Check quickly: \\( 841 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\), 1 mod all other divisors (these small mods are easy to check with simple division).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe largest number \\( k \\) less than 1000 that satisfies the condition of leaving a remainder 1 when divided by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is \\( \\boxed{841} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "We can re-write the requirements of this problem as: \\begin{align*}k &\\equiv1\\pmod{3}\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{4},\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{5},\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{6},\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{7}.\n\\end{align*}In other words, $k-1$ is divisible by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. We have  \\begin{align*}\n\\text{lcm}[3,4,5,6,7] &= \\text{lcm}[3,4,5,7] \\\\\n&= 3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 \\\\&= 420,\n\\end{align*}and thus $k-1$ must be divisible by $420$. The only two multiples of $420$ under $1000$ are $420$ and $840$, so the largest possible value of $k$ is $840+1 = \\boxed{841}$."
