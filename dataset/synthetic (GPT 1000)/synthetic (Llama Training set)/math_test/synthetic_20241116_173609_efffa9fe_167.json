    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nOkay, so we have three positive numbers, \\(j\\), \\(k\\), and \\(l\\). We are given the equations:\n- \\(jk = 24\\)\n- \\(jl = 48\\)\n- \\(kl = 18\\)\n\nOur goal is to find the sum \\(j + k + l\\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\nThis reminds me of some problems where we can express variables to find their sum using given products of pairs. Since these are three equations and three unknowns, it's a good candidate for solving using algebraic manipulation.\n\n### Step 2: Explore Different Strategies\n\nHmm, let\u2019s think about potential strategies:\n1. **Solve for one variable:** Try to isolate one of the variables from the equations and substitute back into others.\n2. **Use factorization:** Sometimes, solving through factors can be insightful when products are involved.\n3. **Symmetric functions:** Consider using properties involving symmetric expressions for \\(j, k, l\\).\n\n### Step 3: Solving for One Variable\n\nLet's try solving for one variable. Since these equations involve products of two, we could try:\n\n\\[\nj = \\frac{24}{k}\n\\]\n\\[\nj = \\frac{48}{l}\n\\]\n\nSince both expressions are equal, set them equal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{k} = \\frac{48}{l}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n24l = 48k \\implies l = 2k\n\\]\n\nThat's a nice start! One relation down. Now let's solve for another.\n\n### Step 4: Substitute to Find More Relations\n\nSubstitute \\(l = 2k\\) into \\(kl = 18\\):\n\n\\[\nk(2k) = 18 \\implies 2k^2 = 18 \\implies k^2 = 9 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSeems good, let me double-check:\n- \\(k = 3 \\rightarrow 2k = 6 \\), so \\(l = 6\\)\n\nI'll now substitute \\(k\\) back to find \\(j\\):\n\nUsing \\(jk = 24\\):\n\n\\[\nj \\cdot 3 = 24 \\implies j = 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate \\(j + k + l\\)\n\nNow we have values:\n- \\(j = 8\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\)\n- \\(l = 6\\)\n\nSum them up:\n\n\\[\nj + k + l = 8 + 3 + 6 = 17\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Verification\n\nWait, always good to double-check:\n- \\(jk = 24 \\rightarrow 8 \\cdot 3 = 24\\) \u2713\n- \\(jl = 48 \\rightarrow 8 \\cdot 6 = 48\\) \u2713\n- \\(kl = 18 \\rightarrow 3 \\cdot 6 = 18\\) \u2713\n\nAll checks out!\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe sum \\(j + k + l\\) is **17**.\n\nReflecting on the process, it seems straightforward once we broke it down and made connections with each substitution. That method worked well, and I'm satisfied with the answer.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $$j=\\frac{24}{k}=\\frac{48}{l}$$we have $l = 2k$. So $18\n= 2k^2$, which means that $9 = k^2$. Since $k$ has to be positive, this implies that $k = 3$. This means that $j = 8$, and $l = 6$. Hence $j+k+l = \\boxed{17}$.\n\nOR\n\nTake the product of the equations to get $jk\\cdot jl\n\\cdot kl = 24 \\cdot 48 \\cdot 18$. Thus $$(jkl)^2 = 20736.$$So $(jkl)^2 =\n(144)^2$, and we have $jkl = 144$. Therefore, $$j = \\frac{jkl}{kl} = \\frac{144}{18} = 8.$$From this it follows that $k=3$ and $l=6$, so the sum is $8+3+6=\\boxed{17}$."
