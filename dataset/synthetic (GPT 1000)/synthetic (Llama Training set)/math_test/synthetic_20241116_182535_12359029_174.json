    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it step-by-step.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWe're dealing with a geometric sequence problem where we need to find the sum of the first five terms given two equations involving differences: \\(a_5 - a_4 = 576\\) and \\(a_2 - a_1 = 9\\). \n\nFirst thing that comes to mind: this sequence is defined by a common ratio. Let's say the first term is \\(a_1 = a\\) and the common ratio is \\(r\\). Then the terms can be expressed as:\n- \\(a_1 = a\\)\n- \\(a_2 = ar\\)\n- \\(a_3 = ar^2\\)\n- \\(a_4 = ar^3\\)\n- \\(a_5 = ar^4\\)\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Using Given Information:**\n\nFrom the problem, we have:\n- \\(a_5 - a_4 = 576\\)  \\(\\Rightarrow ar^4 - ar^3 = 576\\)\n- \\(a_2 - a_1 = 9\\)  \\(\\Rightarrow ar - a = 9\\)\n\n2. **Rewriting the First Equation:**  \n\nThe equation \\(ar^4 - ar^3 = 576\\) can be factored as:\n\\[ ar^3(r - 1) = 576 \\]\n\n3. **Rewriting the Second Equation:**\n\nSimilarly, the equation \\(ar - a = 9\\) can be rewritten as:\n\\[ a(r - 1) = 9 \\]\n\nThis is interesting because both these equations involve \\(r - 1\\). Let's see if this gives us a clue.\n\n4. **Express a Common Insight:**\n\nThe term \\(r-1\\) is common in both equations, so we can express \\(a\\) from the second equation in terms of \\(r-1\\): \n\\[ a = \\frac{9}{r-1} \\]\n\nNow substitute \\(a\\) in the first equation:\n\\[ \\frac{9r^3}{r-1}(r-1) = 576 \\]\n\\[ 9r^3 = 576 \\]\n\n5. **Solving for r:**\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\\[ r^3 = \\frac{576}{9} = 64 \\]\nNow solve for \\(r\\):\n\\[ r = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \\]\n\n6. **Substitute back to find \\(a\\):**\n\nWith \\(r = 4\\), go back to \\(a(r-1) = 9\\) and solve for \\(a\\):\n\\[ a(4-1) = 9 \\]\n\\[ 3a = 9 \\]\n\\[ a = 3 \\]\n\n7. **Calculating the Sum:**\n\nNow calculate \\(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5\\) with \\(a = 3\\) and \\(r = 4\\):\n- \\(a_1 = 3\\)\n- \\(a_2 = 3 \\cdot 4 = 12\\)\n- \\(a_3 = 3 \\cdot 4^2 = 48\\)\n- \\(a_4 = 3 \\cdot 4^3 = 192\\)\n- \\(a_5 = 3 \\cdot 4^4 = 768\\)\n\nAdd these values together:\n\\[ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 3 + 12 + 48 + 192 + 768 = 1023 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- I made sure to check the values by substituting them back into the original conditions. Both \\(a_5 - a_4 = 576\\) and \\(a_2 - a_1 = 9\\) hold true with these \\(a\\) and \\(r\\).\n- Everything seems consistent, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{1023}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the first term, and let $r$ be the common ratio.  Then $ar^4 - ar^3 = 576,$ so $ar^3 (r - 1) = 576.$  Also, $ar - a = 9,$ so $a(r - 1) = 9.$  Then $9r^3 = 576,$ so $r = 4.$  Then $3a = 9,$ so $a = 3.$  Therefore,\n\\[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 3 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\cdot 4^2 + 3 \\cdot 4^3 + 3 \\cdot 4^4 = \\frac{3 (4^5 - 1)}{4 - 1} = \\boxed{1023}.\\]"
