    "working_out": "Alright, facing this problem initially, here's what comes to my mind:\n\n**Understanding the Question:**\nWe are tasked with finding a monic quadratic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) with integer coefficients such that \\( P(\\sqrt{13} - 3) = 0 \\). A monic polynomial means the leading coefficient (that of the highest degree term) is 1. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\nThis problem looks similar to finding a polynomial given some root, like constructing a polynomial from its roots in algebra. If \\(\\sqrt{13} - 3\\) is a root, perhaps its conjugate (since it's of the form \\( a + b\\sqrt{c} \\) where conjugate is \\( a - b\\sqrt{c} \\)) could also be a root. This feels familiar from ways polynomials handle irrational roots.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n1. **Possible strategies:**\n   - Conjugate roots approach: Identifying the other root if the polynomial is to have rational coefficients.\n   - Simplifying expressions possibly to reveal simpler irrational or rational roots and see patterns.\n   - Trial often used for roots \\(\\alpha \\pm \\beta\\sqrt{\\delta}\\) where the conjugate (for simpler quadratic form) also roots.\n\n2. **Why hesitant about initial strategy?**\n   - Checking if I\u2019m over-complicating: Often unfamiliar roots need paired non-integers, but integer polynomials restrict scalable options.\n   - Verifying if \\((\\sqrt{13} - 3)\\) needs both root and conjugate for rational outcome.\n\n**Exploration:**\n- If \\(\\sqrt{13} - 3\\) is a root, then \\(x = \\sqrt{13} - 3\\) leads to thinking of conjugate \\(x_2 = -\\sqrt{13} - 3\\) as a natural second root for quadratic.\n\n**Finding Polynomial:**\n- To find a polynomial with roots \\(x_1 = \\sqrt{13} - 3\\) and \\(x_2 = -\\sqrt{13} - 3\\), construct it using the relationship:\n  \\[\n  P(x) = (x - x_1)(x - x_2)\n  \\]\n\n**Expanding:**\n- Place \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\):\n  \\[\n  P(x) = (x - (\\sqrt{13} - 3))(x - (-\\sqrt{13} - 3))\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = (x - \\sqrt{13} + 3)(x + \\sqrt{13} + 3)\n  \\]\n\n**Simplification:**\n- Apply difference of squares:\n  \\[\n  = ((x + 3) - \\sqrt{13})((x + 3) + \\sqrt{13})\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = [(x + 3)^2 - (\\sqrt{13})^2]\n  \\]\n  \n**Calculating:**\n- Expand and simplify:\n  \\[\n  (x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Square of root: } (\\sqrt{13})^2 = 13\n  \\]\n\n- Insert into the difference formula:\n  \\[\n  P(x) = x^2 + 6x + 9 - 13\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = x^2 + 6x - 4\n  \\]\n\n**Verification:**\n- \\(P(x) = x^2 + 6x - 4\\) is clearly monic (leading coefficient is 1) with integer coefficients.\n- Reflecting: This formulation considers conjugation of characterized root types and the setup seems coherent by systematically exploring structural roots relation and quadratic expression forms.\n  \n**Conclusion:**\nThe monic quadratic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) such that \\( P(\\sqrt{13} - 3) = 0 \\) is \n\\[ \nP(x) = x^2 + 6x - 4 \n\\]\n\nThis polynomial accounts for both \\(\\sqrt{13} - 3\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{13} - 3\\) properly. Checking confirms a logical formation track kept for integer coefficients under the required irrational handling.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x = \\sqrt{13} - 3.$  Then $x + 3 = \\sqrt{13},$ so\n\\[(x + 3)^2 = 13.\\]This simplifies to $x^2 + 6x - 4 = 0,$ so we can take $P(x) = \\boxed{x^2 + 6x - 4}.$"
