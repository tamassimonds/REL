    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll try to write down my thought process as I work through it.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of problems involving rectangles with specific conditions relating side lengths to the area and perimeter. Here, I'm being asked to find rectangles where the area equals five times the perimeter. This seems like an interesting relationship, and I'm curious to see how it restricts my possibilities.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe're looking for rectangles with integer side lengths, so I'll denote the sides as \\( l \\) and \\( w \\). The area of the rectangle is given by \\( A = l \\times w \\) and the perimeter is \\( P = 2l + 2w \\).\n\nThe condition is:\n\\[ l \\times w = 5 \\times (2l + 2w) \\]\n\\[ l \\times w = 10l + 10w \\]\n\nOkay, so the area is equal to five times the perimeter. That's pretty unusual, and I suspect it will limit the number of rectangles that satisfy this condition.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculations:**\n\n1. **Equation Reformulation:**\n   \\[\n   l \\times w = 10l + 10w \n   \\]\n   Rearrange it:\n   \\[\n   lw - 10l - 10w = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Trying Factoring:**\n   Hmm... this reminds me of factoring by grouping or using a substitution might be a good idea. Let's try adding 100 on both sides to complete the square tactic:\n   \\[\n   lw - 10l - 10w + 100 = 100\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expression into a Neat Form:**\n   \\[\n   (l - 10)(w - 10) = 100\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding Integer Solutions:**\n    Now I need to find integer solutions \\((l - 10, w - 10)\\) such that their product is 100. Let's think about the factor pairs of 100: they are \\( (1, 100), (2, 50), (4, 25), (5, 20), (10, 10), (-1, -100), (-2, -50), (-4, -25), (-5, -20), (-10, -10) \\).\n\n5. **Calculating Possible Solutions:**\n    I'll consider the positive factors first:\n   - If \\( l - 10 = 1 \\) and \\( w - 10 = 100 \\), then \\( l = 11, w = 110 \\).\n   - If \\( l - 10 = 2 \\) and \\( w - 10 = 50 \\), then \\( l = 12, w = 60 \\).\n   - If \\( l - 10 = 4 \\) and \\( w - 10 = 25 \\), then \\( l = 14, w = 35 \\).\n   - If \\( l - 10 = 5 \\) and \\( w - 10 = 20 \\), then \\( l = 15, w = 30 \\).\n   - If \\( l - 10 = 10 \\) and \\( w - 10 = 10 \\), then \\( l = 20, w = 20 \\). \n\n6. **Checking for Distinct Rectangles:**\n   Now, I need to check whether these give distinct rectangles. Two rectangles are distinct if \\( l \\neq w \\) and they aren't congruent forms of each other (meaning \\( l \\neq w \\) and \\( w \\neq l \\)).\n   - Solution 1: \\( (11, 110) \\)\n   - Solution 2: \\( (12, 60) \\)\n   - Solution 3: \\( (14, 35) \\)\n   - Solution 4: \\( (15, 30) \\)\n   - Solution 5: \\( (20, 20) \\) **(Note: This is a square, hence same rectangle as \\( 20 \\times 20 \\))**\n\n**Verifying Solutions:**\nNow let's verify if these actually satisfy the original equation. Take a quick look at one:\n- For \\((l, w) = (11, 110)\\):\n  - Area = \\(11 \\times 110 = 1210\\)\n  - Perimeter = \\(2(11 + 110) = 242\\)\n  - \\(5 \\times \\text{Perimeter} = 1210\\).\n\nAll conditions are satisfied, similarly check for others.\n\n**Reflections & Checks:**\nHmm, I found 5 potential pairs, but I have to remember that congruent rectangles might not be distinct. I believe everything lines up well, with distinct solutions appearing for each calculation.\n\n**Final Count:**\nIncluding everything, my final conclusion is that there are 5 distinct solutions (rectangles); counting each independently because of unique side lengths without swaps. \n\n**Lastly...**\nThat's been a really insightful walk through algebraic rearrangement and factor handling for geometry blending conditions. It's neat how the problem simplifies with the completing square method. Time for a final review and then verify each calculation for numerical accuracy.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the side lengths of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$ with $a\\leq b$. Then $ab=10(a+b).$ Expanding and moving all the terms to the left hand side gives $ab-10a-10b=0.$ We apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $100$ to both sides to allow us to factor the left hand side: $$ab-10a-10b+100 = (a-10)(b-10)=100$$From this, we know that $(a-10,b-10)$ must be a pair of factors of $100$. Consequently, the pairs $(a,b)$ that provide different areas are $(11,110),$ $(12, 60),$ $(14, 35),$ $(15, 30),$ and $(20,20)$. There are therefore $\\boxed{5}$ distinct rectangles with the desired property."
