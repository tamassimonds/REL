    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into the problem of rotating a point \\( C \\) about point \\( B \\) 90 degrees counterclockwise. Initially, this problem seems like a straightforward application of rotation in coordinate geometry, but let's break it down carefully and verify at each step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- **Identify the challenge:** We're rotating a point 90 degrees counterclockwise about another point. This reminds me of transformations I\u2019ve done using matrices or rotation formulas.\n- **Tools needed:** Understanding how the rotation center \\( B \\) influences the coordinates of point \\( C \\). If the rotation were around the origin, I'd immediately think of using the formula \\((x, y) \\rightarrow (-y, x)\\). However, it\u2019s not centered at the origin, so there's more to consider.\n- **Decomposition:** Subtract the coordinates of \\( B \\)(the center point) from \\( C \\) to reframe in terms of a more familiar rotation around the origin. Then apply the rotation transformation and finally add the coordinates of \\( B \\) back to result in the actual position.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Reposition the Problem to the Origin:** \n   - **Given Points:** \\( B(4, 1) \\) and \\( C(4, 4) \\).\n   - Shift \\( C \\) relative to \\( B \\): \n     - New coordinates of \\( C \\) relative to \\( B \\) are given by subtracting \\( B \\) from \\( C \\).\n     - \\((C_x - B_x, C_y - B_y) = (4 - 4, 4 - 1) = (0, 3)\\).\n\n2. **Apply the 90-Degree Counterclockwise Rotation:**\n   - **Rotation formula around the origin:** \\((x, y) \\rightarrow (-y, x)\\).\n   - Apply this to \\((0, 3)\\):\n     - The rotated coordinates become \\((-3, 0)\\).\n\n3. **Reposition Back to the Original Coordinate System:**\n   - Now we have the rotated coordinates \\( (-3, 0) \\) which needs to be translated back by adding the coordinates of \\( B(4, 1)\\).\n   - Resulting coordinates:\n     - \\((-3 + 4, 0 + 1) = (1, 1)\\).\n\n### Checking Every Step\n\n- **Check the initial subtraction:** \n  - \\( C - B = (4, 4) - (4, 1) = (0, 3)\\). Confirmed correct.\n- **Verify Rotation:**\n  - Rotation of \\((0, 3)\\) gives \\((-3, 0)\\). Seems consistent with typical rotation logic.\n- **Final Addition:** \n  - \\((-3, 0) + (4, 1) = (1, 1)\\). Final position seems mathematically sound.\n\n### Final Reflection\n\nEverything clicks together now; whatever doubts I had initially about how \\( C \\) moves relative to \\( B \\) have been resolved. The problem is indeed a classic exercise in handling rotations not centered at the origin by cleverly shifting our perspective temporarily to a simpler scenario (rotation about the origin).\n\nThus, the image of \\( C \\) after the rotation is \\((1, 1)\\).",
