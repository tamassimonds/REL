    "working_out": "### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n- **Initial Thoughts:** This problem looks like it involves probability, specifically with a biased coin. Given the unfair nature of the coin, it reminds me of scenarios where the binomial distribution is applicable, which deals with a fixed number of independent trials with two possible outcomes.\n\n- **Problem Restatement:** We have a coin that lands heads with probability \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). We flip this coin 5 times and want the probability of exactly two heads.\n\n### Step 2: Considering Potential Methods\n\n- **Approach 1:** Use the binomial probability formula. This method seems appropriate because we have a fixed number of trials (5), two outcomes (heads or tails), and independent coin flips.\n\n- **Approach 2:** Consider listing all possible outcomes and counting those with exactly two heads. This might be feasible since five flips result in \\(2^5 = 32\\) outcomes, but might become cumbersome.\n  \n- **Approach 3:** Simulation, but without computational tools, this isn't practical in a manual, step-by-step setting.\n\n### Step 3: Choosing an Approach\n\n- **Decision:** I'll proceed with the binomial probability formula because it directly applies to this type of problem and is efficient.\n\n### Step 4: Apply Binomial Distribution\n\n- The binomial probability formula is:\n  \\[\n  P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n  \\]\n  Where:\n  - \\( n = 5 \\) (number of trials)\n  - \\( k = 2 \\) (desired number of heads)\n  - \\( p = \\frac{2}{3} \\) (probability of getting heads)\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Probability\n\n- **Calculate \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculate \\(p^k\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{9}\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculate \\((1-p)^{n-k}\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27}\n  \\]\n\n- **Combine Terms:**\n  \\[\n  P(X = 2) = \\binom{5}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = 10 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{27}\n  \\]\n\n- **Final Calculations:**\n  \\[\n  P(X = 2) = 10 \\cdot \\frac{4}{243} = \\frac{40}{243}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 6: Verification and Reflection\n\n- **Quick Review:** Check each step. Ensure calculations make sense for \\(n, k, p\\). Binomial seems clearly applicable given independent repetitions of the same experiment.\n\n- **Reflect on Outcome:** The probability \\(\\frac{40}{243}\\) is a reasonable outcome in terms of magnitude given \\( p = \\frac{2}{3} \\) is quite high for each flip.\n\n- **Consider Alternatives:** Checked against any simpler methods, and conclude that the chosen method was optimal for accuracy.\n\nFinally, my answer is \\( \\frac{40}{243} \\) for getting exactly two heads from five flips of this unfair coin.",

  "ground_truth": "We need exactly two flips to come up heads and three to come up tails. The odds that two flips come up heads is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2$ and the odds that the other three all come up tails is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3$. We then need to consider the distinct ways of positioning the heads among the 5 flips: we can put the first one in any of 5 places and the second one in any of the remaining 4 places, but they aren't distinct so we need divide by 2 for a total of $\\dfrac{5\\times4}{2}=10$ ways. Thus the probability is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2\\times\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\times10=\\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{243}}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can view flipping this coin 5 times as being equivalent to the expansion of $(h+t)^5$ where $h=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $t=\\frac{1}{3}$. The value of the $h^nt^{5-n}$ term in this expansion will be the probability of getting exactly $n$ heads, so setting $n=2$ and applying the binomial theorem gives us $p=\\dbinom{5}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3=\\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{243}}$, which is the same answer we got using the other method."
