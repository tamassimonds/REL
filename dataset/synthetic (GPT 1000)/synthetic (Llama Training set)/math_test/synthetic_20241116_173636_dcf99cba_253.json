    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think it through step by step. We're given the inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{3(x + 1)}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \\right| \\ge 1\n\\]\n\nFirst thoughts: This problem involves an absolute value and a fraction, which are usually challenging. This looks similar to some inequalities I've solved before, where getting rid of the absolute value step is crucial.\n\n### Step 1: Remove the Absolute Value\n\nThe absolute value inequality \\(|A| \\ge 1\\) translates into two separate inequalities: \\(A \\ge 1\\) or \\(A \\le -1\\). Here, \\(A\\) is \\(\\frac{3(x + 1)}{x^2 + 2x + 3}\\).\n\nThis means we can split the problem into two cases:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{3(x + 1)}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \\ge 1\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{3(x + 1)}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \\le -1\\)\n\n### Step 2: Solve Case 1\n\nLet's tackle the first inequality:\n\n\\[\\frac{3(x + 1)}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \\ge 1\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by the denominator, but note that you should consider where the denominator might be zero. Here, the denominator \\(x^2 + 2x + 3\\) is never zero for real values of \\(x\\) because if we complete the square, we get \\((x+1)^2 + 2\\), which is always positive.\n\nSo we have the inequality:\n\n\\[3(x + 1) \\ge x^2 + 2x + 3\\]\n\nSimplifying this gives:\n\n\\[3x + 3 \\ge x^2 + 2x + 3\\]\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[0 \\ge x^2 - 3x\\]\n\nSimplify further:\n\n\\[x^2 - 3x \\le 0\\]\n\nFactorize:\n\n\\[x(x - 3) \\le 0\\]\n\nThis inequality holds for \\(0 \\le x \\le 3\\).\n\n### Step 3: Solve Case 2\n\nNow, let's consider the second case:\n\n\\[\\frac{3(x + 1)}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \\le -1\\]\n\nAgain, multiply through by the non-zero, positive denominator:\n\n\\[3(x + 1) \\le -(x^2 + 2x + 3)\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[3x + 3 \\le -x^2 - 2x - 3\\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[x^2 + 5x + 6 \\le 0\\]\n\nFactorize:\n\n\\[(x + 2)(x + 3) \\le 0\\]\n\nThis means the solution is in the interval \\(-3 \\le x \\le -2\\).\n\n### Step 4: Combine Solutions\n\nNow, we've got solutions from both cases. Key intervals found are:\n1. \\(0 \\le x \\le 3\\)\n2. \\(-3 \\le x \\le -2\\)\n\nLet's combine these solutions into one interval:\n\nThe solution for \\(\\left| \\frac{3(x + 1)}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \\right| \\ge 1\\) is:\n\n\\[-3 \\le x \\le -2 \\cup 0 \\le x \\le 3\\]\n\n### Conclusion and Final Check\n\nLet's reflect: We approached the problem by breaking down the absolute value into two inequalities, solved each separately, and combined the solutions. Each step considered common factors like completing the square to check for positive denominators, a critical real-world consideration.\n\nQuick check: Each interval logically matches the critical points found and the overall function behavior when testing points in the intervals.\n\nThis flow ensures our solution is correct, with the intervals \\([-3, -2] \\cup [0, 3]\\) being the complete solution.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's reexamine the problem and correct my approach step by step.\n\nWe want to solve the inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{3(x + 1)}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \\right| \\ge 1\n\\]\n\nPreviously, I split this into two cases: \n\n1. \\(\\frac{3(x + 1)}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \\ge 1\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{3(x + 1)}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \\le -1\\)\n\nLet's revisit Case 1:  \n\\(\\frac{3(x + 1)}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \\ge 1\\).\n\nMultiplying both sides by the positive denominator \\(x^2 + 2x + 3\\), we arrive at:\n\n\\[\n3(x + 1) \\ge x^2 + 2x + 3\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\n3x + 3 \\ge x^2 + 2x + 3\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - x \\le 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring gives:\n\n\\[\nx(x - 1) \\le 0\n\\]\n\nThis inequality is satisfied for \\(0 \\le x \\le 1\\), not \\(0 \\le x \\le 3\\) as I previously stated. \n\nNow, let's re-evaluate Case 2:  \n\\(\\frac{3(x + 1)}{x^2 + 2x + 3} \\le -1\\).\n\nMultiplying through by \\(x^2 + 2x + 3\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n3(x + 1) \\le -(x^2 + 2x + 3)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying results in:\n\n\\[\n3x + 3 \\le -x^2 - 2x - 3\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms yields:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 5x + 6 \\le 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring gives:\n\n\\[\n(x + 2)(x + 3) \\le 0\n\\]\n\nThis inequality is satisfied for \\(-3 \\le x \\le -2\\).\n\nHaving corrected both cases, let\u2019s combine these solutions. The correct solution to the original inequality is:\n\n\\[\nx \\in [-3, -2] \\cup [0, 1]\n\\]\n\nAfter rechecking each step in detail and verifying the calculations, we find the solution is consistent with the intervals \\([-3, -2]\\) and \\([0, 1]\\). This process demonstrates the importance of being thorough and verifying results, ultimately confirming the correct set of solutions.",
