  "problem": "It's a well-known physics formula that force equals mass times acceleration.  Jen wants to throw a softball with the same force as Jack throws a baseball.  If the softball has a mass of $200$ g and the baseball has a mass of $150$ g, what is the ratio of acceleration of Jen's ball to Jack's?  Answer as a fraction in lowest terms.",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem together! \n\n### Initial Thoughts \nWhen I first read this question, it immediately brought to mind the basic physics formula \\( F = ma \\), where \\( F \\) is force, \\( m \\) is mass, and \\( a \\) is acceleration. The question requires finding the ratio of acceleration when two different objects with different masses exert the same force.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nThe problem states that both Jen's softball and Jack's baseball are thrown with the same force. We're given the masses and need to determine the ratio of their accelerations.\n\n**Masses given:**\n- Softball: 200 g\n- Baseball: 150 g\n\nSince \\( F = ma \\), setting forces equal gives us:\n\\[ m_{\\text{softball}} \\times a_{\\text{softball}} = m_{\\text{baseball}} \\times a_{\\text{baseball}} \\]\n\nOur goal: Find \\( \\frac{a_{\\text{softball}}}{a_{\\text{baseball}}} \\).\n\n### Exploring the Equation\nGiven that both forces are equal, we have:\n\\[ 200 \\, \\text{g} \\times a_{\\text{softball}} = 150 \\, \\text{g} \\times a_{\\text{baseball}} \\]\n\nTo find the ratio of accelerations, rearrange to get:\n\\[ \\frac{a_{\\text{softball}}}{a_{\\text{baseball}}} = \\frac{150 \\, \\text{g}}{200 \\, \\text{g}} \\]\n\n### Calculation\nAlright, let\u2019s simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{150}{200} \\):\n- Both numbers can be divided by 50 (the greatest common divisor).\n\\[ \\frac{150 \\div 50}{200 \\div 50} = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\n### Checking if this Makes Sense\n- As a reasonableness check: The softball needs more mass less acceleration to achieve the same force as a lighter baseball.\n- Simplifying \\( \\frac{150}{200} \\) gives \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), which means softball's acceleration is 3/4 of baseball's acceleration, indicating less acceleration is indeed needed for the heavier ball to achieve equal force. This makes logical sense.\n\n### Reflection\nEverything checks out\u2014Jen's softball has an acceleration that is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of Jack's baseball acceleration given the equal force they exert and relative masses. This approach seems correct. \n\n### Conclusion\nThe ratio of Jen's softball acceleration to Jack's baseball acceleration is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\). It's in simplest form, rationally checked, and consistent with given information. \n\nHope this helps! Do let me know if there's anything more to discuss.",

  "ground_truth": "If $j_1$ is the acceleration of Jen's ball and $j_2$ is the acceleration of Jack's ball, then we have $$j_1 \\cdot 200 = j_2 \\cdot 150\\qquad \\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{j_1}{j_2} = \\boxed{\\frac 34}.$$"
