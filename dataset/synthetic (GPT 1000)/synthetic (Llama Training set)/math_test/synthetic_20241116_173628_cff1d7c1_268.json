    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem step by step. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\nThe problem gives us a functional equation:  \n\\[ f(xy) = f(x)f(y) \\]  \nfor all real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). We need to determine the possible values of \\(f(1)\\).\n\n#### First Thoughts:\nThis equation is reminiscent of a property of exponential functions, which suggests that \\(f(x) = a^x\\) could be a solution for some base \\(a\\). However, since no specific function form is given, we need to consider other possibilities as well.\n\n### Exploring Solutions\nLet's explore this more rigorously:\n\n#### Step 1: Evaluation at Specific Points\n1. **Let's Evaluate at a Simple Point:**\n   - If we set \\(x = y = 1\\), we get:\n     \\[ f(1 \\cdot 1) = f(1)f(1) \\Rightarrow f(1) = f(1)^2. \\]\n   - **Reflection:** This equation simplifies to \\(f(1) = f(1)^2\\), which implies two possible solutions: \\( f(1) = 0 \\) or \\( f(1) = 1 \\).\n\n#### Step 2: Check the Possibilities Logically\n2. **Checking \\(f(1) = 0\\):**\n   - If \\(f(1) = 0\\), then consider the equation \\(f(x) = f(x \\cdot 1) = f(x)f(1) = f(x) \\cdot 0 = 0\\).\n   - This forces \\(f(x) = 0\\) for all \\(x\\), which indeed satisfies the functional equation \\( f(xy) = f(x)f(y) \\).  \n\n3. **Checking \\(f(1) = 1\\):**\n   - If \\(f(1) = 1\\), this does not force \\(f(x)\\) to be a constant function.\n   - For instance, suppose \\(f(x) = 1^x = 1\\). This satisfies \\(f(xy) = 1 = 1 \\times 1 = f(x)f(y)\\).\n   - However, other functions like \\(f(x) = x^0 = 1\\) (assuming \\(x \\neq 0\\)) are possible too, but \\(f(x) = x^0 = 1\\) implies \\(f(x) = 1\\), which circles back to \\(f(x) = 1\\). More generally, \\(f(x) = x^0 = 1\\) for \\(x \\neq 0\\) also adheres to the condition \\(f(1)^n\\) where \\(n\\) is any real number.\n\n#### Additional Thoughts:\nWhile exploring, it hit me that there could be other functions characterized by subtypes like \"Dirichlet function\" or similar, but aligning them with continuity or other constraints usually simplifies back to \\(f(x) = 1\\) or \\(f(x) = 0\\).\n\n### Checking Symmetry and Intuition\nReflecting on the symmetry \\(f(xy) = f(x)f(y)\\):\n- \\(f\\) must distribute multiplicatively, and both possibilities \\(f(x)=0\\) or \\(1\\) fit.\n- If any other intermediate value is chosen for some \\(x\\), the replicability across all \\(xy\\) distributions hints strongly that there are no intermediate standalone possibilities other than wiping out by zero or permutating by ones.\n\n### Final Answer and Verification:\nGiven all this scrutiny, the only possible values for \\(f(1)\\) based on logical exploration and symmetry are:\n\\[ \\boxed{0, 1} \\]\n\nThis keeps the function consistent with the properties derived from both simple and multiplicative evaluations.",

  "ground_truth": "Setting $x = y = 1,$ we get\n\\[f(1) = f(1)^2,\\]so $f(1) = 0$ or $f(1) = 1.$\n\nThe function $f(x) = 0$ shows that $f(1)$ can be 0, and the function $f(x) = x$ (and the function $f(x) = 1$) shows that $f(1)$ can be 1.  Thus, the possible values of $f(1)$ are $\\boxed{0,1}.$"
