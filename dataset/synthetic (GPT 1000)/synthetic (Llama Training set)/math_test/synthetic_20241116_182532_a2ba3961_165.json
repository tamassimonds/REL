    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem by breaking it down into manageable steps.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\n- I'm looking at a problem that involves finding the slope of a line perpendicular to another given line. \n- This reminds me of the concept that for two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must equal -1.\n- To start, I need to find the slope of the given line connecting the points \\((-1, 2)\\) and \\((1, -2)\\).\n\n### Step 1: Find the Slope of the Given Line\n\nFirst, let's focus on finding the slope of the line containing the points \\((-1,2)\\) and \\( (1,-2) \\). The formula for finding the slope \\( m \\) of a line given two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is:\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n\\]\n\nNow plugging the points \\((-1, 2)\\) and \\( (1,-2) \\) into this formula:\n- \\(x_1 = -1\\), \\(y_1 = 2\\)\n- \\(x_2 = 1\\), \\(y_2 = -2\\)\n\nCalculating the slope:\n\\[\nm = \\frac{-2 - 2}{1 - (-1)} = \\frac{-4}{1 + 1} = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\n- This seems correct based on my calculations. The slope of the line connecting these two points is \\(-2\\).\n- Now, I need to determine the slope of a line that is perpendicular.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Slope of the Perpendicular Line\n\n- Knowing that the lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be \\(-1\\).\n- If the slope of the original line is \\(-2\\), let the slope of the perpendicular line be \\(m_p\\).\n- We set up the perpendicular condition: \\(-2 \\times m_p = -1\\).\n\nSolving for \\(m_p\\):\n\\[\nm_p = \\frac{-1}{-2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Final Check\n\n- Reflecting on this, it matches the concept of perpendicular slopes. If the original slope is negative, the perpendicular slope should be positive (and vice-versa).\n- The opposite reciprocal of \\(-2\\) is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n- The calculations make sense, and everything seems consistent with the properties of perpendicular lines.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe slope of the line perpendicular to the line connecting the points \\((-1, 2)\\) and \\((1, -2)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nHope this detailed walkthrough helps in understanding the process and the mathematical reasoning!",

  "ground_truth": "The slope of the line containing $(-1, 2)$ and $(1, -2)$ is $\\frac{2 - (-2)}{(-1) - 1} = -2$.  Since the other line is perpendicular to this one its slope is the negative reciprocal of $-2$ giving $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
