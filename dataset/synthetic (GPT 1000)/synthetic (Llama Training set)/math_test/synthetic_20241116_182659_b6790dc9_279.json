    "working_out": "### First Thoughts\n\nThe problem gives us two equations: \\(2x = 5y\\) and \\(7y = 10z\\). We're asked to find \\(\\frac{z}{x}\\). This looks like it involves ratios and I think it reminds me of some past problems where I needed to express variables in terms of each other. \n\nMy first thought is that it might be useful to express all variables in terms of one of them, maybe \\(y\\), since it appears in both equations. But then even easier might be to try express \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) in terms of each other directly, this could make calculating \\(\\frac{z}{x}\\) straightforward. I should try starting with these manipulations.\n\n### Step 1: Express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\)\n\nFrom the first equation \\(2x = 5y\\), I want to solve for \\(x\\):  \n\\[ x = \\frac{5}{2}y \\]\n\nSo now \\(x\\) is expressed in terms of \\(y\\). This seems good because now if I can express \\(z\\) in terms of \\(y\\), making the comparison easier.\n\n### Step 2: Express \\(z\\) in terms of \\(y\\)\n\nThe second equation is \\(7y = 10z\\). Let's solve for \\(z\\):  \n\\[ z = \\frac{7}{10}y \\]\n\nNow I've expressed both \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) in terms of \\(y\\). This feels like a step in the right direction. Let me check if these look reasonable. I haven't made a math error yet, so I should be on the right track.\n\n### Step 3: Establish the ratio \\(\\frac{z}{x}\\)\n\nNow I want \\(\\frac{z}{x}\\). Let's substitute the expressions for \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) from earlier here:\n\n\\[ \\frac{z}{x} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{10}y}{\\frac{5}{2}y} \\]\n\nNotice \\(y\\) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, which looks like it will cancel out easily. Let\u2019s simplify:\n\n\\[ \\frac{z}{x} = \\frac{7}{10} \\times \\frac{2}{5} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\frac{z}{x} = \\frac{7 \\times 2}{10 \\times 5} = \\frac{14}{50} \\]\n\nNow, let's simplify \\(\\frac{14}{50}\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{14}{50} = \\frac{7}{25} \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\\(\\frac{7}{25}\\) is the value of \\(\\frac{z}{x}\\). The steps seem to flow well without errors, and the cancellations made sense. It matches my expectations for the type of problem this is. I've checked and it seems to be correct. Also, another method I considered initially was trying maybe keeping track of constant ratios, but directly solving for each variable and cancelling at the end made it straightforward. No corrections are needed at this step, so I'm confident in this solution.\n\nIf any mistake is here, it likely could've been in simplification, but another quick check confirms it. Hence, \\(\\boxed{\\frac{7}{25}}\\) seems right to me.",
