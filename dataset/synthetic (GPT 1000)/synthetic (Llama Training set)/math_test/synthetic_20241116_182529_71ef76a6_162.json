    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step.\n\n**First Impressions:**\nLooking at this, it's a triangle problem involving angles. Immediately, I'm reminded of properties of triangles, specifically that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle always adds up to \\(180^\\circ\\). What's given here are two of the internal angles: \\(60^\\circ\\) and \\(50^\\circ\\). The third angle is \\(x\\), which we need to find. This reminds me of a typical problem where we use the angle sum property.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nI see a triangle with two angles labeled, \\(60^\\circ\\) and \\(50^\\circ\\). The third angle, \\(x\\), is what we need to calculate. In every triangle, the sum of the angles is always \\(180^\\circ\\). So, a logical first step seems to use this property to find \\(x\\).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Unknown Angle**\n- The total for all three angles will be \\(180^\\circ\\).\n- Given angles: \\(60^\\circ\\) and \\(50^\\circ\\).\n- So, to find \\(x\\), we should calculate:\n\n\\[\nx = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 50^\\circ\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[\nx = 180^\\circ - 110^\\circ = 70^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis makes sense intuitively as the angles sum up properly. Let's also reflect: Are there any other elements in the diagram that I might have missed or that could complicate this? \n\nLooking again at the diagram description, I notice there are extraneous lines (like what's drawn from \\((-1,0)\\) to \\((0,0)\\) and from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((-.5,-1.25)\\)). But they don't seem to affect the interior angles of the triangle. They could be part of an extension or embellishments. They're not necessary when determining the angle within the triangle.\n\n**Step 3: Verification**\nAdding together the calculated angles, \\(60^\\circ + 50^\\circ + 70^\\circ\\), I should indeed get \\(180^\\circ\\), and I do. This confirms that \\(x = 70^\\circ\\) seems correct and the solution path, involving the sum of angles in a triangle, is appropriate.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe value of \\(x\\) is \\(70^\\circ\\). \n\nFrom understanding the problem through identifying relevant properties and verifying the calculations, it seems I've captured the right approach and arrived at a logical solution.",
