    "working_out": "Alright, let's jump into this problem.\n\n**Initial Thoughts and Brainstorming:**\n\nThe equation given is \\((17^6-17^5)\\div16=17^x\\). This looks like it involves some exponents and division, so my first thought is that simplifying or factoring might be key.\n\nThis reminds me of using properties of exponents and might involve simplifying expressions. I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s a way to manipulate the left side directly into a form that equals \\(17^x\\).\n\nMaybe if I subtract these powers of 17 cleverly it can match the right side since ultimately both sides need to be in the form of \\(17\\) raised to some power.\n\n**Step-by-Step Work:**\n\n**1. Simplify \\(17^6 - 17^5\\):**\n\nHmm, this feels like it should involve factoring, as that would simplify things quickly. I can factor out the smallest power of 17 present in the terms: \n\n\\[ 17^6 - 17^5 = 17^5(17^1 - 1) \\]\n\nCalculating further, we get:\n\n\\[ 17^1 - 1 = 16 \\]\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\n\\[ 17^5 \\cdot 16 \\]\n\n**2. Divide by 16:**\n\nThe goal is to apply the division correctly now:\n\n\\[ \\frac{17^5 \\cdot 16}{16} \\]\n\nThis simplifies by cancelling out the 16:\n\n\\[ 17^5 \\]\n\n**Checking Work:**\n\nThis transformation seems correct. Step by step, everything checks out so far. This seems to make sense based on how we know exponents and factoring work.\n\n**3. Compare to \\(17^x\\):**\n\nNow, we have:\n\n\\[ 17^5 = 17^x \\]\n\nThis must mean that \\(x = 5\\), because if the bases are equal, then their exponents must be equal as well.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nLooks good! I solved for \\(x\\) correctly by simplifying step-by-step, checking each transformation to make sure I was on track. It's always useful to rely on properties of exponents and factored forms when dealing with expressions like these. \n\nThe final answer is \\(x = 5\\).",
