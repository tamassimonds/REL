    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, thinking about our approach and reflecting as we go.\n\n**First Impressions:**\nLooking at the sequence \\(243, 81, x, y, 3, \\ldots\\), it's decreasing consistently which hints that each term is derived from the previous one by multiplying with a constant less than 1. The problem explicitly states that the successive terms are obtained by multiplying with a constant. This constant is crucial to finding \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n**Strategy Exploration:**\n1. This looks like a geometric sequence because each term is formed by multiplying the previous one with a constant.\n2. Let's denote this constant by \\( r \\). So far, we are given the terms: 243, 81, x, y, and 3.\n\n**Reflections on the Constant \\( r \\):**\n- Calculate \\( r \\) using the given terms 243 and 81. Since 81 is the second term, and 243 is the first term, we have:\n  \\[\n  243 \\times r = 81\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Solve for \\( r \\):\n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{81}{243}\n  \\]\n\n- Let\u2019s quickly compute this:\n  - \\(81/243 = 1/3\\)\n  \n  Great, so \\( r = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n**Checking:**\n- Just to make sure this works, let's confirm:\n  - \\(243 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 81\\). Yes, that checks out!\n\n**Continuing the Sequence:**\n- Now that we know \\( r = \\frac{1}{3} \\), we can find the next two terms in the sequence, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), using this constant:\n  - \\( x = 81 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 27 \\)\n  - \\( y = 27 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 9 \\)\n\n**Verification:**\n- Check that our values are consistent with the sequence:\n  - \\( x \\) is indeed \\(27\\) because \\(81 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 27\\)\n  - \\( y \\) is indeed \\(9\\) because \\(27 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 9\\)\n  - Ensure continuation is correct: \\( 9 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 3 \\), which matches the given sequence.\n\n**Final Step: Sum \\(x + y\\):**\n- Now, find \\( x + y = 27 + 9 = 36 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- After checking our steps, calculations, and reasoning, the value of \\( x + y \\) confidently comes out to \\(36\\).\n  \nThis method seems to be correct, as every step logically follows from the sequence's properties, and all calculations align with the provided sequence information.",

  "ground_truth": "The common ratio $r$, is $\\frac{1}{3}$ (You can find this by dividing 81 by 243).  Therefore, $ x = 27$, $y = 9$, and $x+y = \\boxed{36}$"
