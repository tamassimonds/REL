    "working_out": "Alright, let's start breaking down the problem. We're dealing with a right triangle \\(ABC\\) where \\(\\angle B = 90^\\circ\\). So instantly, I visualize a right triangle with angle \\(A\\) and angle \\(C\\). The problem gives me \\(\\sin A = 2\\cos A\\). I\u2019m tasked with finding \\(\\tan A\\).\n\nFirst Thoughts\n- When I see \\(\\sin A = 2\\cos A\\), it immediately reminds me of trigonometric identities. Specifically, if you have \\(\\sin A\\) and \\(\\cos A\\), you can find \\(\\tan A\\) because \\(\\tan A = \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A}\\).\n- \\(\\tan A\\) can be directly found from the given equation. \n\nInitial Strategy\n- Let's dive into the equation \\(\\sin A = 2\\cos A\\) and see if we can manipulate it to find \\(\\tan A\\).\n- Simplifying the equation by dividing both sides by \\(\\cos A\\) seems like a good start since it will directly give us \\(\\tan A\\).\n\nStep-by-Step Process\n1. **Solve for \\(\\tan A\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\sin A = 2\\cos A \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} = 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\tan A = 2\n   \\]\n\nCheck\n- Let's see if this makes sense. If \\(\\tan A = 2\\), then for the triangle, \\(\\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = 2\\).\n\nReflection\n- Is this consistent? Well, if in a right triangle the tangent of angle \\(A\\) is 2, that means for some configuration of sides, \\((\\text{opposite}) = 2 \\times (\\text{adjacent})\\).\n- If I think about a typical right triangle with opposite = 2 and adjacent = 1, using Pythagoras, the hypotenuse \\(\\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{5}\\). \n\nChecking Trigonometric Values\n- \\(\\sin A = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\) and \\(\\cos A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\).\n- This checks out because \\(\\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}} = 2\\).\n\nConclusion\n- Yes, all calculations are consistent. The given equation holds true under these considerations.\n- Therefore, the requested value of \\(\\tan A\\) is confirmed to be \\( \\boxed{2} \\).\n\nThis approach seems solid since pointing back to the equation \\(\\sin A = 2 \\cos A\\), the trigonometric relationship was precisely what directed us to the solution. Everything seems to match with the expected identity, so I feel confident in this answer.",

Multiplying both sides by $AC$ gives $BC = 2AB$, so $\\frac{BC}{AB} = 2$.  Finally, we have $\\tan A = \\frac{BC}{AB} = \\boxed{2}$.\n\nWe also could have noted that $\\tan A = \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} = \\frac{2\\cos A}{\\cos A } =\\boxed{2}$."
