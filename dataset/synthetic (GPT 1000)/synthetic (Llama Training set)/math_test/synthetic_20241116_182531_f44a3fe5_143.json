    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. The question is asking us to find the number of quarters in the fourth pile when given relationships between four piles and their total adds up to 20. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- This problem seems to rely on understanding relationships between the piles. It reminds me of systems of equations because of the dependencies given in the problem statement.\n- We have four variables here: let's say those represent the number of quarters in each pile.\n- I should label the piles clearly to avoid confusion. Maybe using variable names like \\( P_1, P_2, P_3, \\) and \\( P_4 \\).\n- I'll extract each relationship from the question and try to write them in variable form.\n\n**Brainstorming Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Equations Based on Relationships**: \n   - \\( P_1, P_2, P_3, \\) and \\( P_4 \\) can be defined by the conditions given.\n   - The total number of quarters in these piles sums up to 20, so the equation would be \\( P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + P_4 = 20 \\).\n   - Let's translate each sentence into a mathematical equation:\n     - \"The first pile has 3 fewer than the second pile.\" translates to: \\( P_1 = P_2 - 3 \\).\n     - \"The second pile has 2 more than the third pile.\" translates to: \\( P_2 = P_3 + 2 \\).\n     - \"The fourth pile has twice as many as the second pile.\" translates to: \\( P_4 = 2 \\times P_2 \\).\n\n2. **Substitution and Solving**:\n   - Start by expressing one variable in terms of others using the simplest equations.\n   - Substitute these expressions into the total sum equation \\( P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + P_4 = 20 \\), and solve step by step.\n\n**Steps to Solve:**\n\n1. Express \\( P_1, P_3, \\) and \\( P_4 \\) using \\( P_2 \\):\n   - From \\( P_1 = P_2 - 3 \\)\n   - From \\( P_2 = P_3 + 2 \\) implies \\( P_3 = P_2 - 2 \\).\n   - From \\( P_4 = 2P_2 \\)\n\n2. Substitute these into the sum:\n   \\[\n   (P_2 - 3) + P_2 + (P_2 - 2) + 2P_2 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplify and solve:\n   - Combine like terms:\n     \\[\n     (P_2 - 3) + P_2 + (P_2 - 2) + 2P_2 = 20 \\implies 5P_2 - 5 = 20\n     \\]\n   - Add 5 to both sides:\n     \\[\n     5P_2 = 25\n     \\]\n   - Divide by 5:\n     \\[\n     P_2 = 5\n     \\]\n\n4. Calculate the other piles:\n   - \\( P_1 = P_2 - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2 \\)\n   - \\( P_3 = P_2 - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \\)\n   - \\( P_4 = 2 \\times P_2 = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\)\n\n**Checking My Solution:**\n\n- I should check the total sum:\n  \\[\n  P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + P_4 = 2 + 5 + 3 + 10 = 20\n  \\]\n  - The total checks out, which means the pile allocations are consistent with both the conditions and the total.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- The approach using equations worked well here. Defining each pile in relation to \\( P_2 \\) is effective in breaking down this problem.\n- Solving the problem through substitution was a reasonable and straightforward method for this kind of problem.\n- The relationships and calculations check out, ensuring confidence in the conclusion.\n\nThus, the fourth pile, \\( P_4 \\), indeed contains \\( 10 \\) quarters.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the number of quarters in the first, second, third, and fourth piles be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*} \\tag{1}\na+b+c+d&=20\\\\ \\tag{2}\na&=b-3\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb&=c+2\\\\ \\tag{4}\nd&=2b\n\\end{align*} We want to find the value of $d$. We will express each of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $d$ and then substitute these equations into Equation (1) to find the value of $d$. From Equation (4), we have $b=d/2$. From Equation (3), we have $c=b-2$. Since $b=d/2$, we can rewrite Equation (3) as $c=d/2-2$. We can substitute $b=d/2$ into Equation (2) to get $a=d/2-3$. Substituting $b=d/2$, $c=d/2-2$, and $a=d/2-3$ into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get $(d/2-3)+d/2+(d/2-2)+d=20$, so $d=10$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{10}$ quarters in the fourth pile."
