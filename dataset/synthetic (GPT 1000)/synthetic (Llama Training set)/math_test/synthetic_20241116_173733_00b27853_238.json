    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\nOkay, so I have a circle with a radius of 10 cm. Instantly, I think diameter because that's simply twice the radius, so 20 cm. The problem asks for the largest possible area of an inscribed triangle that has one side as a diameter of the circle. \n\nThis looks familiar... something about triangles and circles... Ah yes, perhaps it's related to right triangles. I remember something about an inscribed triangle using a circle's diameter as one of its sides being special. Let's delve into this idea first.\n\n1. **Understanding the Inscribed Triangle**: \n   \n   When I heard \"triangle with one side as a diameter,\" I started thinking about Thales' Theorem. It mentions that if I have a triangle inscribed in a semicircle, where one side is the diameter, then that triangle is a right triangle. \n\n   This theorem might be useful because right triangles have nice properties, particularly about maximizing areas.\n\n2. **Exploring Geometry and Strategy**: \n\n   With Thales' Theorem in mind, the right triangle has the diameter as the hypotenuse. The largest area of a triangle happens when it's a right triangle with a right angle opposite the hypotenuse. \n\n   Oh! This reminds me: The area of any triangle is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\). For a right triangle, the base and height are the legs of the right triangle. \n\n   Let's consider the fact that I can maximize the area if the triangle is a right-angled triangle:\n   - The base is the diameter which is 20 cm, so let's call it \\(b = 20\\).\n   - Since it's inscribed, the height would be the max possible perpendicular line from the third vertex to the line of the diameter.\n\n3. **Calculating the Area**:\n\n   Now, given that it can be a right triangle, the height from the third vertex (which must be on the circumference due to the inscribed nature) to the hypotenuse is also a radius (10 cm), since the third vertex touches the circle.\n\n   The formula for the area \\(A\\) is:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 \\times 10 = 100 \\, \\text{cm}^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Checking and Reflecting:**\n\n   Quick sanity check: Is a right triangle indeed the maximal area for an inscribed triangle? Yes, due to the fact that the circle's diameter as a hypotenuse guarantees a right triangle, thus maximizing the distance distribution of the opposing vertex under this condition.\n\n   So, given the constraints of the problem, this seems correct.\n\nFinal verification: Areas can't exceed the constraints of how triangles and circles interact geometrically. Given our calculations and understanding, I'm confident that the area of the largest possible inscribed triangle with one side as the diameter is indeed 100 square centimeters.\n\nConclusion: \n\nThe area of the largest such triangle is \\(100\\) square centimeters. This approach seems legitimate as it utilizes geometric properties effectively.",

  "ground_truth": "We may consider the diameter of circle $C$ as the base of the inscribed triangle; its length is $20\\text{ cm}$. Then the corresponding height extends from some point on the diameter to some point on the circle $C$. The greatest possible height is a radius of $C$, achieved when the triangle is right isosceles: [asy]\nunitsize(8);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),10));\ndraw(((-10,0)--(10,0)));\nlabel(\"$20$\",(0,0),S);\ndraw(((-10,-0.8)--(-0.8,-0.6)),BeginArrow);\ndraw(((0.8,-0.8)--(10,-0.8)),EndArrow);\ndraw(((-10,0)--(0,10)));\ndraw(((0,10)--(10,0)));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,10)),dashed);\nlabel(\"$10$\",(0,2.5),E);\n[/asy] In this case, the height is $10\\text{ cm}$, so the area of the triangle is $$\\frac 12\\cdot 20\\cdot 10 = \\boxed{100}\\text{ square centimeters}.$$"
