    "working_out": "### Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, I'm given the task of simplifying \\(\\sqrt{7!}\\). The factorial notation can make things a bit complicated because it involves multiplying all the integers up to a given number. \n\nFirst off, 7 factorial, which is \\(7!\\), means \\(7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\). This can become a large number. My goal is to simplify this expression under the square root sign, so maybe the first step is to actually calculate \\(7!\\).\n\n### Calculating \\(7!\\)\n\nLet me break that down:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n7! &= 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\\\\n   &= (7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1) \\\\\n   &= (7 \\times 6) \\times (5 \\times 4) \\times (3 \\times 2) \\times 1 \\\\\n   &= 42 \\times 20 \\times 6 \\times 1\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nOkay, now let's multiply these out:\n\n1. First, calculate \\(42 \\times 20\\).\n\n    \\[\n    42 \\times 20 = 840\n    \\]\n\n2. Next, multiply the result by \\(6\\).\n\n    \\[\n    840 \\times 6 = 5040\n    \\]\n\nThe calculation seems quite large. Could this actually be manageable under the square root? Let's check our multiplication:\n\n- Confirmed \\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\)\n- Confirmed \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\)\n- Confirmed \\(20 \\times 42 = 840\\)\n- Multiplied \\(840 \\times 6 = 5040\\)\n\nSo, \\(7! = 5040\\). Now, we have \\(\\sqrt{5040}\\).\n\n### Simplifying \\( \\sqrt{5040} \\)\n\nLet's see if \\(\\sqrt{5040}\\) can be simplified further. Perhaps finding the prime factorization of 5040 would help me spot a perfect square factor. \n\n1. **Begin prime factorization of 5040**:\n    - 5040 is even, so divide by 2:\n      \\[\n      5040 \\div 2 = 2520\n      \\]\n    - 2520 is even, divide by 2:\n      \\[\n      2520 \\div 2 = 1260\n      \\]\n    - 1260 is even, divide by 2:\n      \\[\n      1260 \\div 2 = 630\n      \\]\n    - 630 is even, divide by 2:\n      \\[\n      630 \\div 2 = 315\n      \\]\n    - 315 ends in 5, divide by 3:\n      \\[\n      315 \\div 3 = 105\n      \\]\n    - 105 is divisible by 3:\n      \\[\n      105 \\div 3 = 35\n      \\]\n    - 35 ends in 5, divide by 5:\n      \\[\n      35 \\div 5 = 7\n      \\]\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 5040 is: \n\n\\[\n5040 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7\n\\]\n\n2. **Identify perfect squares**: \n\nFrom this factorization, \\(2^4 = 16\\) and \\(3^2 = 9\\), which are perfect squares.\n\n3. **Simplify under the square root**: \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{5040} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 9 \\times 5 \\times 7}\n\\]\n\nThis can be split into:\n\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{16} \\times \\sqrt{9} \\times \\sqrt{5 \\times 7}\n= 4 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{35}\n= 12 \\sqrt{35}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere's no perfect simplification, but at least I simplified to \\(12 \\sqrt{35}\\). I feel confident in this result since I've broken it down into subproblems and rechecked each step. \n\nThus, the simplified form of \\(\\sqrt{7!}\\) is \\(12 \\sqrt{35}\\).",
