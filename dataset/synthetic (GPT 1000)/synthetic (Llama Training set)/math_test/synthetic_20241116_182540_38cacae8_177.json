    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst, let's get a clear picture of what we need to find. We have a circle with a radius of 6 units, and a chord within this circle divides it into two regions. The length of this chord is also 6 units. Our task is to find the area of the larger segment formed by this chord. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\nOkay, this problem involves some geometry, specifically dealing with circles and chords. It reminds me of problems involving circle segments, where you might use some trigonometry or area formulas related to sectors and triangles.\n\nTo break this down:\n1. **Identify the \"segment\" concept**: The circular area cut off by a chord is called a segment. \n2. **Recognize the circle relationship**: We have a circle, and segments of the circle are crucial here.\n3. **Plan**: We could potentially use the formula for the area of a segment, which involves the area of a sector minus the area of a triangle.\n\n### Visualizing and Deciding Path\nHmm, let's draw a rough sketch: \n\n![Circle Sketch](https://i.imgur.com/Vo8kEYj.png)\n\nI see that the chord of 6 units divides the circle. Since the circle's radius is also 6, something clicks. This setup seems like it could involve isosceles triangles, sectors, and chords intersecting points. \n\n### Reviewing Mathematical Concepts\n- **Isosceles Triangle**: Since the radius is equal to the chord length, I immediately think about the triangle formed by the center and the endpoints of the chord. This could be important in our calculation.\n- **Sector and Triangle**: Think about dividing the area into manageable parts; sector area minus triangle area gives you a segment area.\n  \n**Strategy**: \n- Use the relationship \\( 2r \\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\text{chord} \\) to find the central angle.\n- Calculate area of the sector (using angle).\n- Subtract the triangle area from the sector to find the segment area.\n- Compare segment areas to determine the larger area.\n\n### Starting Calculation\n#### Central Angle\nThe central triangle formed by the radii and chord should be isosceles. Using:\n\\[ \n2 \\times 6 \\times \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = 6 \n\\]\nThis simplifies to: \n\\[ \n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \n\\]\nThe angle \\(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\) that satisfies this is 30 degrees (since sine of 30 degrees is 0.5).\n\nThus, the entire central angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(60^\\circ\\) or \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\) radians.\n\n#### Area of Sector\nUsing the formula for sector area:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi} \\times \\pi r^2 = \\frac{\\pi/3}{2\\pi} \\times \\pi \\times 6^2 = 6\\pi\n\\]\n\n#### Area of Triangle\nThe area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord (which is equilateral now):\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times \\sin(60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 36 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 9\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n#### Segment Area\nNow, the area of the smaller segment:\n\\[\n\\text{Segment Area} = \\text{Sector Area} - \\text{Triangle Area} = 6\\pi - 9\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n### Acquiring the Larger Region\nThe entire circle's area is \\( \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi \\).\n\nThe larger region, then, will be:\n\\[\n\\text{Larger Region Area} = 36\\pi - (6\\pi - 9\\sqrt{3}) = 30\\pi + 9\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n### Final Verification and Reflection\n- Double-check calculations: This seems alright as each step consistently checks out.\n- The use of properties, sector areas, and segment calculations aligns with geometric standards.\n- Reflection: This strategy appeared effective, and I like the process flow we implemented. Area check: The solution seems logical and consistent with our geometry principles for larger segments.\n\nThus, the area of the larger segment in simplest form is:\n\\[\n30\\pi + 9\\sqrt{3}\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "Draw radii to the intersection points of the chord with the circle. An equilateral triangle is formed with area $\\frac{6^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 9\\sqrt{3}$. However, the whole section has area $\\frac{36\\pi}{6} = 6\\pi$. If we take the area of the sector away from the area of the entire circle and then add back in the area of the equilateral triangle, we will get the area of the larger region. The area is therefore $36\\pi - 6\\pi + 9\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{30\\pi + 9\\sqrt{3}}$."
