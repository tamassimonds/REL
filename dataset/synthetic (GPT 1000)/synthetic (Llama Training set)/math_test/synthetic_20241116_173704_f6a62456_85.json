    "working_out": "### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the situation here. We're trying to figure out how many different ways 8 people can sit around a table, but here's the twist: Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit next to each other. \n\nWhen people sit around a round table, rotations of a seating arrangement are considered identical. This is a classic circular permutation problem, but with a grouping constraint.\n\n### Step 2: Approach the Problem\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- This kind of reminds me of grouping combinations with circular permutations I've done before.\n- When I hear \"sit together,\" I think we can treat those three individuals as a single unit or \u201csuperperson.\u201d\n- Then I'll have fewer groups to arrange, which simplifies the setup.\n\n**Brainstorm Strategies:**\n1. Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single \"block\" or unit.\n2. Initially, consider how many ways we can permute the 6 blocks (the \"superperson\" and the remaining 5 people) in a circle.\n3. Consider the internal arrangements within the \"superperson\" group.\n\n### Step 3: Developing a Calculation Strategy\n\n**Strategy:**\n- **Step A:** Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single entity. Now instead of 8 people, I have 6 entities.\n- **Step B:** Calculate the circular permutations of these 6 entities.\n- **Step C:** Consider the internal permutations of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Circular Permutation of Entities\n\n**Circular Permutation:**\n- With circular permutations, we fix one person (or entity) and arrange the rest around them.\n- The formula for permutations of \\( n \\) objects around a circle is \\((n-1)!\\).\n- Here, \\( n = 6 \\) (5 single people and the \"superperson\").\n- \\((6-1)! = 5! = 120\\).\n\n### Step 5: Arrange the \"Superperson\"\n\n**Internal Arrangement:**\n- Within the block of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, I can arrange them in \\( 3! \\) ways.\n- \\( 3! = 6 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Total Arrangements\n\n**Combine Arrangements:**\n- Multiply the number of ways to arrange the entities in a circle by the number of ways to arrange the grouped individuals: \n\\[ 5! \\times 3! = 120 \\times 6 = 720 \\]\n\n### Step 7: Double Check the Calculations\n\n**Verify:**\n- Quickly review each part:\n  1. Dealing with a circle correctly.\n  2. Treated 3 people as one and then back to individual permutations.\n- Review seems correct as it aligns with typical problem constraints.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The numbers make sense given the problem constraints.\n- Once I treated Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as one unit, the permutations followed logic and formulaic approaches.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe total number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sitting together, is **720**. This seems consistent when applying these typical strategies to circular and grouped permutations.",

  "ground_truth": "First choose three consecutive seats for Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.  It doesn't matter which three consecutive seats that we choose, since any three such seats can be rotated to any other such seats.  Once the three seats are chosen, there are $3!$ ways to seat the three friends there.  The other five seats are for the other five people, so there are $5!$ ways to seat them there.  The answer is $3! \\times 5! = \\boxed{720}$."
