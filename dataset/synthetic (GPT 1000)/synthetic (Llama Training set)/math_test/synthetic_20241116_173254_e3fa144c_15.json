    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem and think it through step by step.\n\n### First Thoughts:\nWhen I first read the problem, the equation $\\log_{3x} 4 = \\log_{2x} 8$ involves logarithms with different bases. This looks challenging but exciting, as it reminds me of log base transformation properties. I am thinking about properties of logarithms and how to manipulate them. My initial instinct would be to transform the logarithms into a common base, like perhaps base 10 or natural logs, to make them easier to handle mathematically. But let's not jump to a solution yet\u2014we need to address the problem logically.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Equation\nThe equation involves logs with bases that are expressions depending on \\( x \\), specifically \\( 3x \\) and \\( 2x \\). Both sides of the equation resolve to some numerical value when computed.\n\n### Exploratory Strategy:\nSince the problem involves equations with different logarithmic bases, I know there is a special logarithm base change formula: \\(\\log_{a} b = \\frac{\\log_c b}{\\log_c a}\\), where \\(c\\) can be any positive number, usually chosen to simplify calculations or match bases conveniently.\n\nCan I use this formula to frame the problem differently with maybe simpler components? This might help break the problem into more familiar parts.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Change of Base Formula \nLet's try changing both logarithms to a common base. Common choices are natural logarithms (ln) or common logarithms (log base 10).\n\nConvert $\\log_{3x} 4$:\n\\[\n\\log_{3x} 4 = \\frac{\\log 4}{\\log (3x)}\n\\]\n\nConvert $\\log_{2x} 8$:\n\\[\n\\log_{2x} 8 = \\frac{\\log 8}{\\log (2x)}\n\\]\n\nSetting these equal from the original equation, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log 4}{\\log (3x)} = \\frac{\\log 8}{\\log (2x)}\n\\]\n\nHmm, this is interesting. One approach could be to solve for \\(x\\) using these equal numerators and denominators, maybe equate them in such a way to progress. Let me think... if I cross-multiply, it might simplify this:\n\n### Step 3: Cross-multiply\nCross-multiplying gives us:\n\\[\n\\log 4 \\cdot \\log (2x) = \\log 8 \\cdot \\log (3x)\n\\]\n\nI realize now I could further simplify using log properties or express \\(2x\\) and \\(3x\\) in terms of something simpler, knowing that log products must be handled carefully.\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the Equation\nLet\u2019s express everything more simply by computing known logs:\n- \\(\\log 4 = 2\\log 2\\)\n- \\(\\log 8 = 3\\log 2\\)\n\nSubstitute these back in:\n\\[\n2\\log 2 \\cdot \\log (2x) = 3\\log 2 \\cdot \\log (3x)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\log 2\\) is common on both sides, as long as it's not zero (which it's not), we might be able to divide through and eliminate it:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\log (2x) = 3 \\cdot \\log (3x)\n\\]\n\n### Reflect on Progress:\nBreaking down these equations, there\u2019s a route forming where I might express everything in terms of \\(x\\) using properties of logs once more.\n\n### Step 5: Further Simplification\nExpress \\(\\log (2x)\\) and \\(\\log (3x)\\):\n\\[\n\\log (2x) = \\log 2 + \\log x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log (3x) = \\log 3 + \\log x\n\\]\n\nSubstitute back:\n\\[\n2(\\log 2 + \\log x) = 3(\\log 3 + \\log x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\\[\n2\\log 2 + 2\\log x = 3\\log 3 + 3\\log x\n\\]\n\nReorganizing terms:\n\\[\n2\\log 2 - 3\\log 3 = 3\\log x - 2\\log x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2\\log 2 - 3\\log 3 = \\log x\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\(x\\)\nThis boils down to:\n\\[\n\\log x = 2\\log 2 - 3\\log 3\n\\]\n\nWe can express \\(x\\) as:\n\\[\nx = 10^{(2\\log 2 - 3\\log 3)}\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies back through properties \\(a\\log b = \\log b^a\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{27}\n\\]\n\n### Verification:\nLet\u2019s check the answer. Substitute \\(x = \\frac{4}{27}\\) into the original problem equation and see if both log expressions evaluate to the same real number\u2014this acts as a logical check.\n\nYes, both logs will now equate, matching values for these constants, making this approach feel valid and complete.\n\nHence, the solution is \\(x = \\frac{4}{27}\\).",
