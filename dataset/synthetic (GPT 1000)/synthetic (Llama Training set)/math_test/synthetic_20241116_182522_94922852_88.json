    "working_out": "Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\nOkay, we're looking to find the sum of the smallest and largest prime factors of 10101. Immediately, I realize that I need to factorize 10101 into its prime factors. \n\nFactorization of numbers isn't new, but with larger numbers like this, it can be a bit cumbersome. The prime factors I'm interested in are the smallest (potentially the easiest to find) and the largest (which could be trickier). Let's brainstorm how to tackle this.\n\n- **Direct division approach**: Start trying out the smaller prime numbers and see which ones divide 10101 without a remainder. This isn't the most efficient for very large prime numbers, but worth a try to get the smallest prime factor first.\n- **Patterns or special number properties**: Investigating if 10101 might have any special properties or patterns. Sometimes numbers like this might break down into factors rather easily with tricks (e.g., being close to 10100 might hint at something).\n- **Use pre-known divisibility tricks**: Like divisibility rules for 2, 3, 5, 11, etc., to quickly eliminate or confirm potential factors.\n\n### Step-by-Step Factorization\n\n1. **Check if divisible by 2 (evenness):**  \n   - 10101 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n\n2. **Check divisibility by smaller primes:**  \n   - **3:** Sum of digits: \\(1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3\\). This sum is divisible by 3, so check if 3 divides 10101.\n   - Quickly divide: \\(10101 \\div 3 = 3367\\).  \n   So, 3 is a prime factor.\n\n3. **Finding other factors (Next smallest prime):**\n   - Now divide 3367 by other small primes: 5, 7, 11, etc., until one works.\n   - **5:** Last digit isn't 0 or 5, so not divisible.\n   - **7:** Do long division or use divisibility rule (Multiply last digit by 2 and subtract from rest).  \\(336 - (2 \\times 7) = 336 - 14 = 322\\). 322 isn't divisible by 7.\n   - **11:** Alternating sum rule or direct division. Check divisions.\n   - **13:** Direct division, \\(3367 \\div 13 = 259\\).  \n   Found another factor: 13.\n\n4. **Now move to factors of 259:**\n   - **3:** Already checked, doesn\u2019t divide.\n   - **11:** \\(259 \\div 11 = 23.545\\), not an integer.\n   - **17:** \\(259 \\div 17 = 15.235\\), not an integer.\n   - **19:** \\(259 \\div 19 = 13.631\\), not an integer.\n   - **23:** Direct division yields integer: \n   \\(259 \\div 23 = 11\\).  \n   Found factors: 11 and 23.\n\nWith our checks through, the prime factorization of 10101 gives us the primes 3, 11, and 23. \n\n### Largest and Smallest Prime Factors\n\n- Smallest: 3\n- Largest: 37 (Wait, I need to verify each step above, looks like this sorting might have skipped checking for 37 in decomposition clearly).\n\nAfter revisiting our steps, the factorization decomposition does reveal the following:  \n\\[ 10101 = 3 \\times 3367 \\]\n\\[ 3367 = 13 \\times 259 \\]\n\\[ 259 = 7 \\times 37 \\]\n\nWith this factor history, our simplicity gives largest factor amongst distinct: 37\n\n### Sum Calculation\n\\(3 + 37 = 40\\)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI have verified and taken strategic steps exploring divisibility, solved by successive decompositions. If anything feels off, I caught it by backtracking my steps and corrections. The sum of the smallest (3) and largest (37) prime factors of 10101 is 40.",

  "ground_truth": "$10101$ is clearly not divisible by $2$ or $5$. The sum of $10101$'s digits is $3$, so it is divisible by $3$, but not by $9$. $10101=3\\cdot3367$. $3367/7=481$ and $481/7=68\\frac{5}{7}$ so $10101=3\\cdot7\\cdot481$ and $481$ is not divisible by any prime number less than $11$. Applying the divisibility test for 11, we have $4-8+1=-3$, which is not divisible by 11, so $481$ is not divisible by $11$ either. $481/13=37$ and $37$ is prime, so the prime factorization of $10101$ is $10101=3\\cdot7\\cdot13\\cdot37$. So, the sum of its smallest and largest prime factors is $3+37=\\boxed{40}$."
