    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\nOkay, I'm looking at defining the range of all real numbers that are not in the domain of the function given in the question. The function is composed of three separate rational functions, each with its own restriction. When initially looking at this problem, some strategies come to mind:\n\n- Each term in the function has its own denominator that cannot be equal to zero. That implies that finding the values of \\(x\\) that make any denominator equal to zero will give us the numbers we need.\n\n- This reminds me of the kinds of problems where you first list the restrictions of each component of the function.\n\nHmm, at first glance, this looks like it involves solving some polynomial equations since all terms involve \\(x\\) raised to different powers. Let's look deeper at each one.\n\nStep-by-Step Exploration:\n\n1. **Identify the problem spots:**\n   - I'll start by looking at each part of the function separately:\n     - For \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 - 7}\\), \\(x^2 - 7 = 0\\). \n     - For \\(\\frac{1}{x^3 - 8}\\), \\(x^3 - 8 = 0\\).\n     - For \\(\\frac{1}{x^4 - 9}\\), \\(x^4 - 9 = 0\\).\n\n2. **Solve each equation:**\n\n   a. **\\(x^2 - 7 = 0\\):**\n\n   - Solving this gives \\(x^2 = 7\\),\n   - Therefore \\(x = \\sqrt{7}\\) or \\(x = -\\sqrt{7}\\).\n\n   Let's pause here. I should simply check if these make sense - they should both work since squaring either value would equal 7.\n\n   b. **\\(x^3 - 8 = 0\\):**\n\n   - Solving this leads to \\(x^3 = 8\\),\n   - Which means \\(x = \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2\\).\n\n   Double-checking 2^3 equals 8 confirms this is correct.\n\n   c. **\\(x^4 - 9 = 0\\):**\n\n   - Here, solve for \\(x^4 = 9\\),\n   - Then, \\(x = \\sqrt[4]{9} = \\pm \\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n   Carefully reconsider this one: \\((\\sqrt{3})^4\\) and \\((- \\sqrt{3})^4\\) both effectively yield 9. This makes sense.\n\n3. **Reflection on Domain Values:**\n   - Think about these numbers - they are the ones that make each denominator zero and thus do not allow those terms of the function to exist.\n\n4. **Sum up the Values**:\n\n   - I need to sum up \\( \\sqrt{7}, - \\sqrt{7}, 2, \\sqrt{3}, \\) and \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n   - Let\u2019s see, \\(\\sqrt{7} + (-\\sqrt{7}) = 0\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3} + (-\\sqrt{3}) = 0\\).\n\n   - So the only number left is \\(2\\).\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis feels right. The problem was effectively asking us to identify where the function breaks down into undefined areas and then sum them. Each step led me to values that logically checked out based on the constraints they put on the denominators.\n\nThe sum of all real numbers that are not in the domain of the function is \\(2\\).",
