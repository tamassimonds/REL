    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by finding the value of \\(2x^2 + 3x + 4\\) when \\(x = -2\\). I'll take this step-by-step, reflecting and checking as I go. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\nFirst off, the problem doesn't look too unfamiliar. It seems straightforward\u2014essentially, just plugging in a value. But I don't want to be too hasty; I need to check my work carefully.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe have an expression \\(2x^2 + 3x + 4\\), and need to evaluate it for \\(x = -2\\). The question is essentially asking us to substitute \\(-2\\) into every instance of \\(x\\) in the expression and then calculate the result. \n\n### Exploring Strategies\n- **Direct Substitution**: This seems like the most straightforward approach. Plug in \\(-2\\) for \\(x\\) and compute.\n- **Consider Simplifying**: Though the expression seems simple, it might help to consider if any simplification could make the calculation easier after substitution. In this case, simplifying doesn't really apply since we have distinct variables and constants.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with direct substitution:\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n1. **Substitute \\(x = -2\\) into the expression:**\n   \n   \\[\n   2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) + 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\((-2)^2\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   (-2)^2 = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Plug the result into the expression:**\n\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4 + 3(-2) + 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the terms:**\n\n   \\[\n   8 + 3(-2) + 4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate \\(3(-2)\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (-2) = -6\n   \\]\n\n6. **Substitute the result:**\n\n   \\[\n   8 - 6 + 4\n   \\]\n\n7. **Combine the terms:**\n\n   - First, combine \\(8 - 6\\):\n\n     \\[\n     8 - 6 = 2\n     \\]\n\n   - Then add 4:\n\n     \\[\n     2 + 4 = 6\n     \\]\n\nSo, the value of \\(2x^2 + 3x + 4\\) when \\(x = -2\\) is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).\n\n### Double Checking\nLet\u2019s quickly run through the calculation again in my head:\n\n- \\(2(-2)^2 = 2 \\times 4 = 8\\)\n- \\(3(-2) = -6\\)\n- Then, \\(8 - 6 + 4\\) simplifies to \\(2 + 4 = 6\\)\n\nIt seems consistent both ways. No errors jumped out during calculation \u2013 everything seems reasonable and makes sense.\n\n### Reflection\nThe direct substitution approach worked quite well for this problem. A systematic step-by-step method ensured each part was calculated correctly. Always good to reflect on strategies for different problems, but here it was fairly straightforward.\n\nThe answer is indeed \\(\\boxed{6}\\), and I'm confident in this result. Nothing tops double-checking both your substitution and arithmetic. All set!",
