    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem and try to understand what it's asking for. At first glance, it involves finding the missing coordinates of a parallelogram given three vertices, with the condition that \\(x > 7\\). We need to determine the missing coordinates \\((x, y)\\) and find the sum \\(x + y\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Structure of a Parallelogram\nA parallelogram is a quadrilateral with opposite sides that are equal and parallel. A key property is that the diagonals bisect each other. Perhaps this property can help find the missing vertex.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring Initial Strategies\n\n#### Strategy A: Using Midpoint/Bisecting Property\n1. **Diagonal Bisects**: Since diagonals bisect each other, the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other. We could use this property:\n   - Diagonals are \\((5, 3)\\) to \\((x, y)\\) and \\((6, 8)\\) to \\((7, 4)\\).\n   - Calculate the midpoints of these diagonals.\n   \n2. **Midpoint Calculation**: \n   - Midpoint of \\((5, 3)\\) and \\((x, y)\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{5+x}{2}, \\frac{3+y}{2}\\right)\\).\n   - Midpoint of \\((6, 8)\\) and \\((7, 4)\\) is \\(\\left(\\frac{6+7}{2}, \\frac{8+4}{2}\\right) = (6.5, 6)\\).\n\n3. **Equating Midpoints**:\n   - \\(\\frac{5+x}{2} = 6.5\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{3+y}{2} = 6\\)\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)**:\n   - \\(\\frac{5+x}{2} = 6.5 \\implies 5 + x = 13 \\implies x = 8\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \\implies 3 + y = 12 \\implies y = 9\\)\n\n5. **Check if \\(x > 7\\)**: The solution \\(x = 8\\) satisfies this condition, so \\(x = 8\\) is valid.\n\n#### Strategy Assessment\nThis approach seems to have provided a plausible solution consistent with the given conditions. I'll stick with this because the diagonal bisecting property is a strong geometric property for a parallelogram and these calculated coordinates meet the problem's criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate \\(x + y\\)\nWith \\(x = 8\\) and \\(y = 9\\), compute \\(x + y = 8 + 9 = 17\\).\n\n### Final Thoughts\n- By using the diagonal bisecting property, I was able to find the missing vertex. The properties of parallelograms aligned with my solution.\n- I double-checked the calculations and conditions. Everything holds up, confirming \\(x + y = 17\\) is a consistent and accurate result for this problem setup.\n\nSo, the value of \\(x + y\\) is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Name the points $A(5,3)$, $B(6,8)$, $C(7,4)$, and $D(x,y)$ and sketch the first three.  We find that there are three possible locations for $D$ (see figure).  Only the one to the right has an $x$-coordinate greater than 7.  Since $AC$ is parallel to $BD$ and equal in length to it, $D$ is two units to the right and one unit up from $B$, just as $C$ is two units to the right and one unit up from $A$.  Therefore, the coordinates of $D$ are $(8,9)$, and $x+y=8+9=\\boxed{17}$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(5cm);\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=5;\nreal x = 7;\npair A=(5,3), B=(6,8), C=(7,4), D1=(8,9), D2=(4,7),D3=(6,-1);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\nxaxis(-2,10,Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero),Arrows(4));\nyaxis(-2,10,Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero),Arrows(4));\ndraw(A--C--D1--B--cycle);//linetype(\"8 8\"));\ndraw(A--D3--C);\ndraw(A--C--B--D2--cycle);//,linetype(\"1 2 3 1\"));\nlabel(\"$A(5,3)$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B(6,8)$\",B,NW);\nlabel(\"$C(7,4)$\",C,E);\ndot(D1,UnFill);\ndot(D2,UnFill);\ndot(D3,UnFill);[/asy]"
