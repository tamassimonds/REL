    "working_out": "### Initial Brainstorming\n\nOkay, let's think about this problem: compute $\\arccos \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right)$. \n\n1. **Understanding the problem**: The $\\arccos$ function, or the inverse cosine function, will give us the angle whose cosine is $-\\frac{1}{2}$. The output of the $\\arccos$ function is usually in the range $[0, \\pi]$ radians.\n\n2. **Initial thoughts**: I know that cosine of some common angles. For example, $\\cos(0) = 1$, $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 0$, and $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$. When I see $-\\frac{1}{2}$, it rings a bell because $\\cos$ of certain angles in the unit circle are often $\\pm 1/2$. In particular, I recall $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n3. **Reflecting on symmetry**: The cosine function is symmetric around $\\pi$, so $\\cos(\\pi - \\theta) = -\\cos(\\theta)$. Recalling this property is key. Since $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = \\frac{1}{2}$, a possible solution might be related to this.\n\n### Calculate the Solution\n\n4. **Using the symmetry**: From the property $\\cos(\\pi - \\theta) = -\\cos(\\theta)$, I can find an angle whose cosine is $-\\frac{1}{2}$ by setting $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$. This gives $\\cos(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{3}) = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n5. **Finding the angle**: Thus, $\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{3\\pi}{3} - \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\n\n6. **Reflect**: Hmm, this angle $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ is indeed in the range $[0, \\pi]$, which is the range of the $\\arccos$ function. That makes sense because the $\\arccos$ of a negative number will be in the second quadrant ($\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to $\\pi$).\n\n### Verification\n\n7. **Quick check**: I see that $\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}$. This verifies that the angle found is indeed correct because it matches with what we want.\n\n8. **Double-check the function range**: Let me think if everything makes sense in terms of function behavior and ranges. The $\\arccos$ function returns angles in the range $[0, \\pi]$, and $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ clearly falls in this range.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n9. **Ensure correctness**: The steps and thought process align with both the cos identity and the inverse function behavior. Nothing seems off.\n\nThus, the final answer is $\\arccos \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians.\n\nBy going through these steps, the solution appears reliable and verifiable, and the process helps internalize the relationship between angles and their trigonometric functions.",
