    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem involving triangle $\\triangle{RST}$. Our goal is to find $\\sin{T}$, given that $\\sin{R} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n1. **Understanding the Setup**: We have a right triangle $\\triangle{RST}$ with $RS$ as the hypotenuse (since there is a right angle at $S$ given by the \u201crightanglemark\u201d notation), and we know $\\sin R$.\n\n2. **Remembering the Definition of Sine**: \n   - For angle $R$, $\\sin R = \\frac{\\text{opposite side to } R}{\\text{hypotenuse}}$.\n   - For angle $T$, $\\sin T = \\frac{\\text{opposite side to } T}{\\text{hypotenuse}}$.\n\n3. **Using Given Information**: \n   - We know $\\sin R = \\frac{2}{5}$, which means the side opposite $R$ (let's call it $ST$) is 2 units long, and the hypotenuse $RS$ is 5 units long.\n\n### Deeper Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Visualizing the Triangle**\n\n- The hypotenuse ($RS$) is 5 units long.\n- The side opposite to angle $R$ ($ST$) is 2 units.\n\n**Step 2: Pythagorean Theorem for Missing Side**\n\n- We need the length of the third side $RT$ (let's call it $x$).\n- By the Pythagorean theorem: $x^2 + 2^2 = 5^2$.\n- Simplifying, $x^2 + 4 = 25$.\n- Further simplification, $x^2 = 21$.\n- So, $x = \\sqrt{21}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating $\\sin T$**\n\n- Now, let's switch to angle $T$. The side opposite $T$ is $RT = \\sqrt{21}$, and the hypotenuse $RS$ remains 5.\n- Therefore, $\\sin T = \\frac{\\text{opposite to } T}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}$.\n\n### Verification & Reflection\n\n- **Double-checking calculations**: Verify that $x = \\sqrt{21}$ is calculated correctly using the Pythagorean theorem.\n- **Confirming trigonometric definitions**: Reflect if the definition of sine was applied correctly for both angles.\n- **Cross-checking**: Switch perspectives and consider other trigonometric identities like $\\cos$, etc., to ensure consistency.\n\nEverything seems to align accurately. Considering this thorough analysis, the answer to $\\sin T$ is:\n\\[\n\\sin T = \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}\n\\]\n\nThis approach reflects a logical progression through understanding the problem, applying mathematical concepts, and verifying calculations, which reassures our confidence in the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Because $\\triangle RST$ is a right triangle, $\\sin R = \\frac{ST}{RT}$. So $\\sin R = \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{ST}{5}$. Then $ST=2$.\n\nWe know that $\\sin T = \\frac{RS}{RT}$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $RS = \\sqrt{RT^2 - ST^2} = \\sqrt{25-4} = \\sqrt{21}$. Then $\\sin T = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}}$."
