    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n- This problem involves a product of many fractions, specifically from \\( n = 1 \\) to \\( n = 2004 \\). Each fraction\u2019s numerator and denominator are polynomials. \n- These polynomials have different structures, with the numerator being a quadratic in complete form and the denominator having a constant with a square root.\n- My gut feeling is to look for patterns or simplifications such as a telescoping nature or symmetry that might help reduce this monster of a product.\n\nInitial ideas and brainstorming:\n1. Simplification: Replacing \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) in a creative way or rationalizing some might help spot a pattern.\n2. Pattern recognition: Check if substituting values helps the fraction simplify exceptionally at specific points.\n3. Telescoping Products: Since these are consecutively indexed, is there a telescoping structure hidden here?\n\nLet's start with simplification, as it's imperative to know how the fractions behave:\n\\[ \n\\frac{n^2 + 2n - 1}{n^2 + n + \\sqrt{2} - 2}\n\\]\nAlgebraic simplification:\n- Given the structure of the quadratic expressions, try synthetic division or algebraic manipulation to deconstruct or relate numerator and denominator if possible.\n\nI realize this might not yet tell what it becomes:\n- They're close polynomials up to constant parts, hinting no simple reduction directly.\n- Let me see if any product property can apply.\n\nLet's attempt another strategy:\n1. Calculate the first few values of the product manually and see...\n2. Check if it results in nice numbers or simplifications.\n3. Perhaps guess a pattern from these early values which solves quicker, then confirm generally.\n\nCompute first few values:\n- For \\( n=1 \\), \n  \\[\\frac{1^2 + 2(1) - 1}{1^2 + 1 + \\sqrt{2} - 2} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sqrt{2}}\\]\n  \n- For n=2\n  \\[\\frac{2^2 + 2(2) - 1}{2^2 + 2 + \\sqrt{2} - 2} = \\frac{7}{4 + \\sqrt{2}}\\]\n\nBoth these aren't intuitively telescoping yet. Hmm, maybe the numerators simplify by telescopic reasoning over broader bounds.\n\nTesting succeeding values might get tedious and convoluted if this isn't leading far. Perhaps let's investigate if reformation into a shifted series helps:\n- Shift or decouple \\( n \\) factors in the polynomial forms.\n\nAha moment:\n- Consider \\( n=1 \\) through \\( n=2004 \\), break parts across telescope structures hypothetically:\n\\[ \\frac{(n+1)^2 - 2}{n(n+1) + \\sqrt{2} - 2} \\]\n\nI might then compute individual immersions... does this collapse well in symmetric sequences or mathematical constructs?\n- Perhaps substituting a symmetry could apply from patterns.\n\nI'll double-check and intertwine roots by altering expressions again:\n- Approach such that aiming constructs \\( (a-b)(a+b)=a^2-b^2 \\) frameworks? Proposed polynomials:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n^2 + 2n - 1}{n^2 + (n + \\sqrt{2} - 2)} \n\\]\n\nRandom insight from cancellation checking:\n- Intuition addresses \n\\[ a^2 + c, x - \\sqrt{y}, \\text{use potentially recursive properties} \\]\nand determinant structures.\n\nReanalyze:\nI've been going critical, is analytical messy indicating non-trivial sequences without clear larger identity? \n- Let's breathe and try changing formats again. Pure algebra against multiple effects remains enigmatic.\n\nSince trials suggest complexity determination, I backtrack, opt computational formulation and verify recurrent simplifications through numeric sequences.\n\nFinishing thoughts:\nAligning this cumulative evaluation can imply observation rather than compiling directly. Discussion led me reevaluating if any intrinsic modular characteristics had arisen.\n\nI'll conclude here: While computation's fully traversed wasn't enumerated for clarity, some latent dynamic likely expresses through broader simplify or numeric function. Experimentation will resolve with uncovering underlying expression or particularizing entire structural balance.",
