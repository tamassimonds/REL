    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this geometry problem step-by-step. The setup is that we have a square \\(ABCD\\) and an equilateral triangle \\(AED\\) sharing side \\(\\overline{AD}\\).\n\n### First Thoughts\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry Configuration**: The problem statement mentions a square and an equilateral triangle that share a side, \\(\\overline{AD}\\). Visualizing this setup is crucial. The triangle \\(AED\\) shares side \\(AD\\) with the square.\n\n2. **Angle of Interest**: We're asked to find the angle \\(BAE\\). Knowing that \\(AED\\) is an equilateral triangle and \\(ABCD\\) is a square might help us find this angle.\n\n3. **Possible Relationships**: Both square properties (all sides equal and each angle \\(90^\\circ\\)) and equilateral triangle properties (all sides equal and each angle \\(60^\\circ\\)) seem relevant here.\n\n### Strategy and Calculations\n\n1. **Properties of the Equilateral Triangle \\(AED\\)**:\n   - All sides are equal: \\(AD = AE = ED\\).\n   - All angles are \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Properties of the Square \\(ABCD\\)**:\n   - All sides are equal, i.e., \\(AB = BC = CD = DA\\).\n   - All angles are \\(90^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Identifying Angle \\(BAE\\)**:\n   - Given \\(ABCD\\) is a square and \\(\\angle BAD = 90^\\circ\\) because of this.\n   - Since \\(\\angle DAE\\) is part of the equilateral triangle \\(AED\\), we know \\(\\angle DAE = 60^\\circ\\).\n\n4. **Exploring the Relationship**:\n   - \\(\\angle BAD\\) is part of the square's property being \\(90^\\circ\\).\n   - \\(\\angle DAE\\) is part of the equilateral triangle's property being \\(60^\\circ\\).\n   - Notice that point \\(E\\) and line \\(\\overline{AE}\\) extend from \\(\\overline{AD}\\) at a \\(60^\\circ\\) angle (since \\(\\angle DAE\\) is \\(60^\\circ\\)).\n\n5. **Finding \\(\\angle BAE\\)**:\n   - Now, observe that \\(\\angle BAE = \\angle BAD - \\angle DAE\\).\n   - Calculate: \n     \\[\n     \\angle BAE = \\angle BAD - \\angle DAE = 90^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 30^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Thus, \\(\\angle BAE = 30^\\circ\\).\n\n### Conclusion and Verification\n\nReflecting on the solution, it all lines up with known properties of squares and equilateral triangles:\n\n- The equilateral triangle's angles and the square's perpendicular angles lead us naturally to subtract the equilateral triangle's inner angle from the square's right angle.\n- Each step logically follows from the geometric properties, as explored above.\n\nThe measure of angle \\(BAE\\) is \\(30^\\circ\\). This approach holds consistently against the properties of squares and equilateral triangles, confirming its accuracy. The exploration wasn't overly complex due to recognizing the direct subtraction of angles shared at vertex \\(A\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, so the measure of each angle of an equilateral triangle is 60 degrees.  Therefore, the measure of angle $EAD$ is 60 degrees.  Also, angle $BAD$ measures 90 degrees.  Therefore, the measure of angle $BAE$ is $90^\\circ-60^\\circ=\\boxed{30}$ degrees."
