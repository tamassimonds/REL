    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and unpack it step by step, exploring different strategies and reflecting along the way.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nLooking at the equation \\(2z + i = iz + 3\\), the goal is to solve for \\(z\\) and express it in the form \\(x + yi\\). Right off the bat, I notice it resembles a linear equation with complex numbers. I have a feeling this might involve manipulating the equation to isolate \\(z\\), eventually expressing it in terms of its real and imaginary parts.\n\n- **First instinct:** The presence of \\(i\\), the imaginary unit, suggests separating real and imaginary components could help. Linear equations with complex numbers usually simplify in that way.\n\n### Strategy Thoughts\n\n**Possible strategies:**\n\n1. **Isolate \\(z\\):** Move all terms involving \\(z\\) to one side of the equation and constants to the other.\n2. **Separate real and imaginary parts:** Simplifying both sides might help in explicitly identifying real and imaginary components.\n\nLet's try moving all terms involving \\(z\\) to one side first and see where it leads.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Reorganize the equation:**\n   \\[\n   2z + i = iz + 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2z - iz = 3 - i\n   \\]\n\n2. **Factor out \\(z\\):**\n   \\[\n   z(2 - i) = 3 - i\n   \\]\n   - Alright, now this clearly shows \\(z\\) is factored with the complex coefficient \\(2 - i\\).\n\n3. **Solve for \\(z\\):**\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{3 - i}{2 - i}\n   \\]\n\n   - I now need to simplify \\(\\frac{3 - i}{2 - i}\\). Aha! Dividing complex numbers typically requires multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.\n\n### Simplifying the Fraction\n\n4. **Multiply by the conjugate:**\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{(3 - i)(2 + i)}{(2 - i)(2 + i)}\n   \\]\n\n   - **Conjugate strategy:** Multiplying by \\(2 + i\\) (the conjugate) should help eliminate \\(i\\) from the denominator.\n\n5. **Calculate the denominator:**\n   \\[\n   (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 2i - 2i - i^2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n   \\]\n\n6. **Expand the numerator:**\n   \\[\n   (3 - i)(2 + i) = 6 + 3i - 2i - i^2 = 6 + i + 1 = 7 + i\n   \\]\n\n7. **Combine results:**\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{7 + i}{5} = \\frac{7}{5} + \\frac{1}{5}i\n   \\]\n\n### Reflection\n\n- The process followed logically. Multiplying by the conjugate worked to clear \\(i\\) from the denominator, simplifying to a form where real and imaginary parts could easily be seen.\n- Checks out: the computations were straightforward. Each had independent mini-checks, like verifying the multiplication in both numerator and denominator (e.g., knowing \\(i^2 = -1\\)).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe solution for \\(z\\) in terms of its real and imaginary parts is:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{7}{5} + \\frac{1}{5}i\n\\]\n\nAt every step, we factored, adjusted by conjugates, and confirmed computations\u2014an efficient method for such a complex number equation. Solving felt intuitive after setting up the structure and isolating elements relevant to the unknown \\(z\\).",
