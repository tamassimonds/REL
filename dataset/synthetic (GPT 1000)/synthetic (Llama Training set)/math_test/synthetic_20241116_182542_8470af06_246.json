    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I need to evaluate the expression \\(3x^2 + 5x - 1\\) when \\(x = 7\\). At first glance, this looks like a straightforward problem of substituting the value of \\(x\\) and then performing arithmetic operations to find the result. \n\nMy initial thoughts are:\n\n1. **Substitution**: This reminds me of basic algebra problems where we substitute a value into an expression. It's like when you plug values into a function and then simplify. So my first step is going to be substituting \\(x = 7\\) into the expression.\n\n2. **Simplification**: After substitution, I\u2019ll need to simplify the expression by following the order of operations, also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction).\n\nLet me write out the substitution step:\n\n\\[ 3x^2 + 5x - 1 \\text{ becomes } 3(7)^2 + 5(7) - 1 \\]\n\nNow, I'll take this one component at a time to avoid errors:\n\n- **Calculate \\(7^2\\)**: This is the exponent part, where \\(7^2 = 49\\). So far, seems manageable.\n- **Calculate \\(3 \\times 49\\)**: Because multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, I have \\(3 \\times 49 = 147\\). \n\nNow, let\u2019s pause and think quickly about the numbers. \\(147\\) seems reasonable because \\(50 \\times 3\\) would be \\(150\\), and \\(49\\) is close to \\(50\\). So that part checks out.\n\nNext steps are:\n\n- **Calculate \\(5 \\times 7\\)**: That would be \\(35\\).\n- Now, the expression looks like: \\(147 + 35 - 1\\).\n\nHere, I should check:\n- **Addition**: First, do \\(147 + 35\\). Quick mental math tells me that \\(147 + 35 = 182\\). \n- **Subtraction**: Finally, do \\(182 - 1\\), which equals \\(181\\).\n\nReflecting on each step briefly, the arithmetic didn't have any complex steps, and each component follows basic operations. The numbers used were relatively easy to handle mentally. \n\nBefore I declare this final, let\u2019s verify:\n\n- The structured approach was substitution followed by simplification according to operations order \u2013 so the thought process aligns well.\n- No anomalies were spotted in execution, and calculations lined up logically after rechecking.\n\nFinally, my solution should be:\n\nThe expression \\(3x^2 + 5x - 1\\) evaluates to **181** when \\(x = 7\\). \n\nIf there were a mistake, I\u2019d re-examine each math operation; thankfully, everything seems correct here!",
