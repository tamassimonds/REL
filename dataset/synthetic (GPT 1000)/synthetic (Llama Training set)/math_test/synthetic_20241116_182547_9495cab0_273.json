    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem where we have to find the smallest three-digit positive integer congruent to 1 (mod 7).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what \"congruent to 1 (mod 7)\" means. This is saying that when a number is divided by 7, it leaves a remainder of 1. For example, 8 is congruent to 1 modulo 7 because \\(8 \\div 7 = 1\\) remainder 1.\n\nWe're looking for the smallest three-digit number that satisfies this condition.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Range\nThe three-digit numbers range from 100 to 999. So, our answer must be within this range.\n\n### Step 3: Exploring Strategies\nI can think of a few strategies to find this number:\n1. Start from 100 and check sequentially which number first meets the condition.\n2. Use a more systematic approach where I solve an equation using the properties of modulo arithmetic.\n\nHmm, initially, let's start simply by checking sequentially from 100. This seems straightforward.\n\n### Step 4: Sequential Checking\nBegin with 100:\n- \\(100 \\div 7 = 14\\), remainder 2. So, 100 is not congruent to 1 (mod 7).\n- \\(101 \\div 7 = 14\\), remainder 3. So, 101 is not congruent to 1 (mod 7).\n- \\(102 \\div 7 = 14\\), remainder 4. So, 102 is not congruent to 1 (mod 7).\n- \\(103 \\div 7 = 14\\), remainder 5. So, 103 is not congruent to 1 (mod 7).\n- \\(104 \\div 7 = 14\\), remainder 6. So, 104 is not congruent to 1 (mod 7).\n- \\(105 \\div 7 = 15\\), remainder 0. So, 105 is not congruent to 1 (mod 7).\n- \\(106 \\div 7 = 15\\), remainder 1.\n\nOh! When we reach 106, we have a remainder of 1. So 106 is congruent to 1 (mod 7).\n\n### Step 5: Reflect\nI should reflect on whether this solution is correct. I checked each number methodically, starting from 100, and confirmed 106 is the first number where the remainder is 1. It fits the condition, and it's the smallest three-digit number in this range that does. That makes sense intuitively and matches our requirement for a simple approach.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe smallest three-digit positive integer congruent to 1 (mod 7) is 106. It feels right based on the check, and I'm confident in this result.\n\nIf I wanted another verification step, I might try calculating backwards from where 100 is (remainder 2) to get an idea of 106 directly, but the manual check confirmed it well enough.\n\n---\n\nThere you go!

  "ground_truth": "We divide 100 by 7 to obtain a quotient of 14 and a remainder 2. Since 100 is congruent to 2 (mod 7), we find that 99 is congruent to 1 (mod 7). Thus the next integer congruent to 1 (mod 7) is $99 + 7 = \\boxed{106}$."
