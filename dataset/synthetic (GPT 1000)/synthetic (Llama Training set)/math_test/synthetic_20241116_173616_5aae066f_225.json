    "working_out": "**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, we are given the line equation \\(3x + 2y = 12\\) and need to find the value of \\(b\\) when \\(a = 4\\). This means we need to substitute \\(x = 4\\) into the equation and solve for \\(y\\). This feels straightforward because it\u2019s essentially a substitution problem, but let's explore it a bit to be sure I\u2019m not missing anything.\n\n**Brainstorming Approaches:**\n\n1. **Substitution Method:**\n   - Directly substitute \\(a = 4\\) into the equation and solve for \\(b\\).\n\n2. **Graphical Understanding:**\n   - I could graph the line \\(3x + 2y = 12\\) and visually inspect where the point \\((4, b)\\) lies. However, this is not computationally efficient just to find one point.\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:**\n   - Solve for \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\) first, then substitute \\(x = 4\\). This might not be necessary here because the substitution method seems direct enough.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe substitution method seems straightforward and the most logical method to solve this problem without extra steps.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Substitution:**\n   - We know the equation is \\(3x + 2y = 12\\). Substitute \\(x = 4\\) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     3(4) + 2y = 12\n     \\]\n\n2. **Simplify:**\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     12 + 2y = 12\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(y\\):**\n   - Subtract 12 from both sides to solve for \\(2y\\):\n     \\[\n     2y = 0\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 2:\n     \\[\n     y = 0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - So, when \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = 0\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- I substituted the value of \\(x = 4\\) correctly and followed through with the calculations. The approach seems correct as the equation balanced perfectly.\n- Double-checking by substituting \\(x = 4, y = 0\\) in the original equation gives:\n  \\[\n  3(4) + 2(0) = 12 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 12 = 12\n  \\]\n  which confirms that the pair \\((4, 0)\\) satisfies the equation.\n\n- Everything seems consistent, and I didn't encounter any issues with this method. \n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nWhen \\(a = 4\\), the value of \\(b\\) is \\(0\\).",
