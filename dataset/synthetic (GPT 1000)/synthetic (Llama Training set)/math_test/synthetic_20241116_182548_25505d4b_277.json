    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem together. We're tasked with finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, 315 and 108. Not gonna lie, seeing these numbers, I'm thinking, \"This looks familiar; I\u2019ve definitely done problems like this before...\" but let's work through it step by step.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**: One way to find the GCD is by breaking each number down into its prime factors. Then, the GCD is the product of all common primes.\n   \n2. **Euclidean Algorithm**: This involves repeatedly applying the process of division, using the remainder as the new divisor, which can sometimes be quicker than factorization.\n\n3. **Common Sense Check**: Quick checks if either number is a multiple of a commonly known smaller number which might sometimes reveal the GCD by inspection.\n\nSince it's always a good idea to start with methods known for their efficiency, let's delve into each method briefly.\n\n### Step-by-step Thought Process using Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n1. **Initial Look**: \n   - Here, both numbers are not very large, which is promising for manual computation. I\u2019m inclined to use the Euclidean algorithm first because it's known to be methodical and efficient.\n\n2. **Euclidean Algorithm Approach**:\n   - This method involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then using the remainder to repeat the process.\n   - Start by dividing 315 by 108.\n   \n   \\[\n   315 \\div 108 \\text{ gives quotient } 2 \\text{ and remainder } 99.\n   \\]\n\n   - Check: Okay, so 108 fits into 315 two times completely, with 99 left over. So, 99 is the new divisor.\n\n3. **Second Iteration**:\n   - Now, divide 108 by 99.\n   \n   \\[\n   108 \\div 99 \\text{ gives quotient } 1 \\text{ and remainder } 9.\n   \\]\n\n   - Hmm, interesting! 99 fits into 108 exactly once, leaving a much smaller remainder of 9. This seems promising.\n\n4. **Third Iteration**:\n   - Now, divide 99 by 9.\n\n   \\[\n   99 \\div 9 \\text{ gives quotient } 11 \\text{ and remainder } 0.\n   \\]\n\n   - Whoa, okay! The remainder is now 0, which means 9 is the GCD of 315 and 108!\n\n### Verification and Reflection:\n\n- Let's quickly verify using prime factorization to double-check.\n  - \\(315 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7\\)\n  - \\(108 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3\\)\n  \nThe common prime factor is \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\n- Sweet! Both methods agree, and 9 feels right. Our process seems legitimate!\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe greatest common divisor of 315 and 108 is **9**. It's always a satisfying wrap-up to see all methods pointing to the same answer. Reflecting on using the Euclidean algorithm, it reminds me just how handy it is \u2013 really efficient for hand calculations without needing to write out all the factors. \n\nThis was quite an engaging exercise!",

  "ground_truth": "We find the prime factorizations of the two numbers: \\begin{align*}\n315&=3^2\\cdot5\\cdot7,\\\\\n108&=2^2\\cdot3^3.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe only common prime factor is $3$; the minimum exponent of $3$ is $2$, so the GCD is $3^2=\\boxed{9}$."
