    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step and really think through it carefully.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question\n\nWe need to find all real numbers \\( x \\) that satisfy the equation:\n\\[\n(2^x - 4)^3 + (4^x - 2)^3 = (4^x + 2^x - 6)^3\n\\]\nThis looks a bit perplexing at first glance due to the cubic terms. It makes me think this could be similar to a form like \\( a^3 + b^3 = c^3 \\) where I can use some properties of sum of cubes, but let's see how this might unfold.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Possible Methods\n\n - **Substitution**: Consider letting \\( a = 2^x-4 \\), \\( b = 4^x-2 \\), and \\( c = 4^x + 2^x - 6 \\). This gives \\( a^3 + b^3 = c^3 \\).\n - **Factorization**: Recall the identity for the sum of cubes: If \\( a^3 + b^3 = c^3 \\), we typically need it in the form where a common factor can be used.\n - **Try Particular Values**: Sometimes plugging in simple values can reveal if there's an obvious solution or pattern.\n\n**Initial Reaction**: The form \\( a^3 + b^3 = c^3 \\) is uncommon for having solutions unless \\( a, b, c \\) have special relationships. This makes me think about both checking specific values and leveraging any simplifying identities.\n\n### Step 3: Specific Values\n\nLet's try \\( x = 2 \\) as a manageable test case:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( a = 2^x - 4 \\):**\n   \\[\n   a = 2^2 - 4 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate \\( b = 4^x - 2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   b = 4^2 - 2 = 14\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Calculate \\( c = 4^x + 2^x - 6 \\):**\n   \\[\n   c = 4^2 + 2^2 - 6 = 16 + 4 - 6 = 14\n   \\]\n\nSubstituting in the identity \\( a^3 + b^3 = c^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   0^3 + 14^3 = 14^3\n   \\]\nThis checks out because:\n   \\[\n   0 + 14^3 = 14^3 \\quad \\text{is true}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Explore if Other Values Exist\n\nConsider another substitution \\( 4^x = y \\), which implies \\( 2^x = \\sqrt{y} \\). The equation in terms of \\( y \\) becomes:\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{y} - 4)^3 + (y - 2)^3 = (y + \\sqrt{y} - 6)^3\n\\]\n\nSolving this algebraically seems messy, and my hunch is that \\( x = 2 \\) could be the unique meaningful solution. Let\u2019s look at special cases:\n\n- **If \\( x = 0 \\):**\n  \\[\n  (2^0 - 4)^3 + (4^0 - 2)^3 = (4^0 + 2^0 - 6)^3 \\]\n  Simplifying gives:\n  \\[\n  (-3)^3 + (-1)^3 = (-4)^3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -27 - 1 = -64\n  \\]\n  False, as \\(-28 \\neq -64\\).\n  \n- **General Implication**: Realistically \\( 0, 2 \\) do something, and examination beyond resonable \\( x \\) deduces around \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nConsidering various options and checking through simplifications and specific calculations, the distinct real solution appears derived from:\n- Unique identifications shown feasible only at \\( x = 2 \\).\n- Algebraic complexity elsewhere gives no substantive comparative resolution.\n\nHence, the solution is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my earlier reasoning. It's essential to revisit the problem with fresh eyes and a clearer focus on all potential solutions. Let's go through this step by step again, being more meticulous this time.\n\n### Step 1: Re-evaluating the Equation\n\nWe've been given the problem:\n\\[\n(2^x - 4)^3 + (4^x - 2)^3 = (4^x + 2^x - 6)^3\n\\]\n\nPreviously, I only considered \\( x = 2 \\), but it's crucial to explore more possibilities.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring Other Values\n\nLet's return to the idea of setting \\( a = 2^x - 4 \\) and \\( b = 4^x - 2 \\). This gives us the equation:\n\\[ \na^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3\n\\]\nExpanding the right-hand side, we have:\n\\[\na^3 + b^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[ \n3a^2b + 3ab^2 = 0\n\\]\nFactoring further, we get:\n\\[ \n3ab(a + b) = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Factor Conditions\n\nThis leads us to three cases:\n\n1. **Case \\( a = 0 \\):**\n   \\[\n   2^x - 4 = 0 \\implies 2^x = 4 \\implies x = 2\n   \\]\n   This solution is valid as we saw earlier.\n\n2. **Case \\( b = 0 \\):**\n   \\[\n   4^x - 2 = 0 \\implies 4^x = 2 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   This is another potential solution.\n\n3. **Case \\( a + b = 0 \\):**\n   \\[\n   2^x + 4^x = 6\n   \\]\n   Let's check if there are solutions for this equation.\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Equation \\( 2^x + 4^x = 6 \\)\n\nWe note that:\n\\[ \n4^x = (2^x)^2\n\\]\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n(2^x)^2 + 2^x = 6\n\\]\nLetting \\( y = 2^x \\), we have:\n\\[\ny^2 + y - 6 = 0\n\\]\nFactoring this quadratic equation gives:\n\\[\n(y - 2)(y + 3) = 0\n\\]\nThis results in:\n\\[ \ny = 2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y = -3\n\\]\nSince \\( y = 2^x \\) must be positive, we discard \\( y = -3 \\).\n\nHence, the valid solution is \\( y = 2 \\), which gives:\n\\[ \n2^x = 2 \\implies x = 1 \n\\]\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation are: \n\\[ \nx = \\frac{1}{2}, 1, 2 \n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBy carefully analyzing and exploring each scenario, we've deduced the complete set of solutions to the equation. The solutions are:\n\\[ \n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}, 1, 2}\n\\]\nThese values satisfy the original condition, confirmed by plugging back into the equation. I appreciate the opportunity to revisit and correct my approach to ensure the accuracy of these results.",
