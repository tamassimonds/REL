    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and unravel it bit by bit.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nThis is definitely an intriguing polynomial equation due to the way it's set up. We have a condition given by \\( p(1) = 210 \\), and this equation:\n\n\\[\n(x + 10) p(2x) = 8(x - 4) p(x + 6)\n\\]\n\nThis seems to tell us something crucial about the relationship between the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) at different arguments. Such an equation might imply some sort of symmetry or invariance, or perhaps some roots or functional form are involved. This reminds me of problems involving linear transformations, especially because of the scaling in the argument from \\( x \\) to \\( 2x \\) and \\( x+6 \\).\n\n**Exploration and Strategy:**\n\n1. **Degree Consideration:** We have polynomials on both sides, so considering their degrees might help:\n   - The left side's polynomial when expanded is of degree \\( \\text{deg}(p) + 1 \\).\n   - The right side's polynomial when expanded has the same degree since it's \\( 8 (x-4)p(x+6) \\).\n\n   This suggests that the degrees on both sides should match up, indicating that \\( \\text{deg}(p) \\) remains constant.\n\n2. **Test Simplicity First:** Often with these sorts of problems, checking for relatively simple forms of \\( p(x) \\), like constants, linear, or quadratic forms, can unveil insights. Let\u2019s assume at first a lower degree polynomial and see if it works, given the degree should match on both sides.\n\n3. **Substitute and Check Easy Values:** Testing specific values of \\( x \\) might simplify the equation enough to decipher \\( p(x) \\).\n\n**Step-by-step Work:**\n\n1. **Degree Matching and Hypothesis:**\n\n   Let's hypothesize \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic, i.e., \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\). Let's later check if this assumption fits our requirements.\n\n2. **Plugging Values:**\n\n   Plugging \\( x = 0 \\) into the given relation:\n\n   \\[\n   10 p(0) = -32 p(6)\n   \\]\n\n   If we consider \\( p(0) = g \\), then \\( p(6) = h \\), this means \\( 10g = -32h \\).\n\n3. **Try Simplifying the Given Condition More Explicitly:**\n\n   Substituting \\( x = -10 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   0 = -112 \\, p(-4)\n   \\]\n\n   This might not be so helpful unless \\( p(-4) = 0\\), but this seeming contradiction tells us to move to another strategy.\n\n4. **Functional Form Insight:**\n\n   Let's see the functional equation peculiarity further: If we assume \\( p(x) \\) to be of certain symmetry like constant, assuming \\( p(x) = k \\) doesn\u2019t satisfy unless substituted into \\( p(1)=210\\).\n\n   Another good value to test is substituting \\( x=2 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   12 p(4) = 0 \\rightarrow p(4) = 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Consolidate Consistent Roots and Find the Form:**\n\n    The polynomial might have roots we conjectured, so considering \\( p(x) = (x-4)q(x) \\) with consistent root exploration from value checking.\n\n6. **Using Known Evaluation:**\n\n   Match \\( p(1) = 210 \\), particularly by hypothesizing:\n\n   \\[\n   (2x-4) = 8(x+6) (x-4) \\Rightarrow (x-4)^2\n   \\]\n\n   Thus inferring it should be \\( p(x) = a(x-4)^2 \\).\n\n   Adjust values and consistent testing - which simplifies to \\( p(x) \\) retaining the form \\( k (x-4)(x-r)\\) where continuity remains without double zero issues and root matching evaluation using linear polynomial scaling.\n\n7. **Plug \\( x=10 \\) to Compute \\( p(10) \\):**\n\n   Assume we simplify to particular potential form, as previously postulated degrees remain consistent with given \\( p(1)\\):\n\n   This concludes \\( 10p(10) = 1680\\) solution within non-trivial consistent derivations and interpretations scrutinized built on working forms without computational errors, hypothesizing linear \\( x-10 \\) products.\n\n   Using substitution based on obtained constants repeatedly.\n\n8. **Verification with Prior Results:**\n\n   Solidify initially forming evaluations paired with zero calculations to eliminate contradictions while solving by hypothesizing in context sorted by pairings.\n\nTherefore, computes as tested reaffirmed verified values lead directly pre-solved predicted consistency:\n\n\\[ \n\\boxed{1680}\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s verify all conditions remain valid fixing resolved verifications ensuring correct interpretations derived checks complete computations, remeasure solution pathways.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous attempt. Let's take another look at the problem and explore different strategies to find the correct solution for \\( p(10) \\).\n\n**Re-examining the Problem:**\n\nWe're given that \\( (x + 10) p(2x) = 8(x - 4) p(x + 6) \\) for all real numbers \\( x \\) and \\( p(1) = 210 \\). Our goal is to find \\( p(10) \\).\n\n**Strategy Reevaluation:**\n\n1. **Identifying Roots:**\n\n   Let's start by trying to identify potential roots of \\( p(x) \\) that can be derived from the given functional equation. Substitute specific values for \\( x \\):\n\n   - **Substitute \\( x = 4 \\):**\n     \\[\n     14p(8) = 0 \\Rightarrow p(8) = 0\n     \\]\n     Thus, \\( p(x) \\) has a factor of \\( x - 8 \\).\n\n   - **Substitute \\( x = -10 \\):**\n     \\[\n     8(-14)p(-4) = 0 \\Rightarrow p(-4) = 0\n     \\]\n     Here, \\( p(x) \\) has a factor of \\( x + 4 \\).\n\n   - **Substitute \\( x = -2 \\):**\n     \\[\n     8p(-4) = 8(-6)p(4) \\Rightarrow p(4) = 0\n     \\]\n     Therefore, \\( p(x) \\) has a factor of \\( x - 4 \\).\n\n2. **Formulating \\( p(x) \\):**\n\n   From the roots found, we can express \\( p(x) \\) as:\n   \\[\n   p(x) = (x - 8)(x - 4)(x + 4)q(x)\n   \\]\n   where \\( q(x) \\) is a polynomial.\n\n3. **Matching the Functional Equation:**\n\n   Substituting back into the original equation:\n   \\[\n   (x + 10)(2x - 8)(2x - 4)(2x + 4)q(2x) = 8(x - 4)(x - 2)(x + 2)(x + 10)q(x + 6)\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying shows:\n   \\[\n   q(2x) = q(x + 6)\n   \\]\n\n   This indicates that \\( q(x) \\) must be a constant (since no non-constant polynomial satisfies \\( q(2x) = q(x + 6) \\) unless it's constant). Let's denote this constant as \\( c \\).\n\n4. **Determine the Constant \\( c \\):**\n\n   Given \\( p(1) = 210 \\), substitute into the formulated polynomial:\n   \\[\n   p(1) = c(1 - 8)(1 - 4)(1 + 4) = c(-7)(-3)(5) = 105c\n   \\]\n   Setting this equal to 210, we solve for \\( c \\):\n   \\[\n   105c = 210 \\Rightarrow c = 2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating \\( p(10) \\):**\n\n   Now that we have \\( p(x) = 2(x - 8)(x - 4)(x + 4) \\), we can find \\( p(10) \\):\n   \\[\n   p(10) = 2(10 - 8)(10 - 4)(10 + 4) = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 14\n   \\]\n\n   Calculating:\n   \\[\n   = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 14 = 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 14 = 24 \\cdot 14 = 336\n   \\]\n\nThus, after reevaluating and correcting my approach, the value of \\( p(10) \\) is \\(\\boxed{336}\\).",
