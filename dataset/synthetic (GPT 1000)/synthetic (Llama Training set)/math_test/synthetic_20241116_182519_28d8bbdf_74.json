    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this step-by-step. I'll share my thought process as we work through this problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nOkay, so we have two functions, \\(f(x) = 7x + 5\\) and \\(g(x) = x - 1\\). We're asked to find the inverse of the composite function \\(h(x) = f(g(x))\\), which means \\(h(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x-1)\\). \n\nFirst thoughts: This looks like a function composition problem where after composing \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), I need to find the inverse of the resulting function.\n\n### Step 2: Compose \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) to find \\(h(x)\\)\nLet's find \\(h(x)\\) first by substituting \\(g(x) = x - 1\\) into \\(f(x)\\).\n\n1. Substitute \\(g(x) = x - 1\\) into \\(f(x)\\):\n   \\[ f(g(x)) = f(x - 1) = 7(x - 1) + 5 \\]\n\n2. Simplify:\n   \\[ = 7x - 7 + 5 \\]\n   \\[ = 7x - 2 \\]\n\nSo, \\(h(x) = 7x - 2\\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the Inverse of \\(h(x) = 7x - 2\\)\nNow, I need to find the inverse of the function \\(h(x) = 7x - 2\\). The general strategy for finding an inverse is to swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and solve for the new \\(y\\).\n\n1. Let \\(y = 7x - 2\\).\n\n2. To find the inverse, swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n   \\[ x = 7y - 2 \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\(y\\):\n   \\[ x + 2 = 7y \\]\n   \\[ y = \\frac{x + 2}{7} \\]\n\n4. Thus, the inverse function, denoted as \\(h^{-1}(x)\\), is:\n   \\[ h^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x + 2}{7} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Inverse Function\nNow, let's check if our work for finding the inverse makes sense by verifying if \\(h(h^{-1}(x)) = x\\).\n\n1. Substitute \\(h^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x + 2}{7}\\) into \\(h(x)\\):\n   \\[ h(h^{-1}(x)) = 7 \\left(\\frac{x + 2}{7}\\right) - 2 \\]\n   \\[ = (x + 2) - 2 \\]\n   \\[ = x \\]\n\nThis confirms that \\(h(h^{-1}(x)) = x\\), so the inverse is correct.\n\n### Reflection\nReflecting on the process, everything seems to have flowed logically. I composed the functions correctly, and my steps to find the inverse were standard practice. Verifying the inverse solidified my confidence in the solution.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe inverse of \\(h(x) = 7x - 2\\) is \\(h^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x + 2}{7}\\). This step-by-step breakdown ensured thorough understanding and verification of each part of the problem. It reminds me of something I've done before, but it's always good to walk through problems systematically to catch any potential errors.",

  "ground_truth": "\\[h(x)=f(g(x))=7(x-1)+5=7x-2.\\]Let's replace $h(x)$ with $y$ for simplicity, so \\[y=7x-2.\\]In order to invert $h(x)$ we may solve this equation for $x$.  That gives \\[y+2=7x\\]or  \\[x=\\frac{y+2}{7}.\\]Writing this in terms of $x$ gives the inverse function of $h$ as  \\[h^{-1}(x)=\\boxed{\\frac{x+2}{7}}.\\]"
