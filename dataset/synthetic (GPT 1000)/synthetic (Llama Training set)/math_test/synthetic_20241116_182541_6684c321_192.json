    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We have the system of equations given by:\n\n1. \\(3a + b + c = -3\\)\n2. \\(a + 3b + c = 9\\)\n3. \\(a + b + 3c = 19\\)\n\nOur goal is to find \\(abc\\). \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nMy first thought is that we have three variables, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) with three linear equations, which usually points towards a system we could solve using substitution or elimination.\n\nBut before jumping straight in, I should remember that the question asks for \\(abc\\), not the individual variables themselves. Maybe there's a shortcut or pattern that can help. \n\nSince these equations are quite symmetric, perhaps sum manipulation or elimination could simplify things quicker.\n\n### Possible Strategies\n\n1. **Substitution or Elimination:** Classic methods for solving systems of equations. Given the symmetry, eliminating variables might be efficient.\n\n2. **Sum or Difference Equations:** Sometimes summing or subtracting equations can reveal a pattern or simplify directly to a known quantity.\n\n3. **Direct Product Equation Approach:** Construct an equation of the form that directly gives \\(abc\\).\n\nLet's explore each briefly to see what might work here.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n**Substitution/Elimination:**\n\n- **Adding Equations:** Maybe summing the equations might give me insight:\n\n  \\[\n  (3a + b + c) + (a + 3b + c) + (a + b + 3c) = -3 + 9 + 19\n  \\]\n\n  Simplifying the left-hand side:\n\n  \\[\n  5a + 5b + 5c = 25\n  \\]\n\n  Which reduces to:\n\n  \\[\n  a + b + c = 5\n  \\]\n\n  Oh, this is great! Now we have a simpler relationship between \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n- **Substitute or Eliminate Further:** Let\u2019s use the equation \\(a + b + c = 5\\) with one of the initial equations to solve for individual variables.\n\n  Subtracting this new equation from the original ones could help me eliminate variables.\n\n  Using \\(3a + b + c = -3\\):\n\n  \\[\n  (3a + b + c) - (a + b + c) = -3 - 5\n  \\]\n\n  This simplifies to:\n\n  \\[\n  2a = -8 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = -4\n  \\]\n\n  Now use \\(a + 3b + c = 9\\):\n\n  \\[\n  (a + 3b + c) - (a + b + c) = 9 - 5\n  \\]\n\n  Simplifying gives:\n\n  \\[\n  2b = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = 2\n  \\]\n\n  Finally, use \\(a + b + 3c = 19\\):\n\n  \\[\n  (a + b + 3c) - (a + b + c) = 19 - 5\n  \\]\n\n  Simplifying gives:\n\n  \\[\n  2c = 14 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c = 7\n  \\]\n\n**Check Calculations:**\n\n- Calculations appear consistent so far. Replacing found values back in \\(a + b + c = 5\\), we get:\n\n  \\[\n  -4 + 2 + 7 = 5\n  \\]\n\n  Checks out!\n\n**Find \\(abc\\):**\n\n- Now, calculate \\(abc\\):\n\n  \\[\n  abc = (-4) \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 = -56\n  \\]\n\n### Final Check:\n\nQuick back-check: substituting \\(a = -4\\), \\(b = 2\\), \\(c = 7\\) into the initial equations to ensure they are satisfied:\n\n1. \\(3(-4) + 2 + 7 = -12 + 9 = -3\\)\n2. \\((-4) + 3(2) + 7 = -4 + 6 + 7 = 9\\)\n3. \\((-4) + 2 + 3(7) = -4 + 2 + 21 = 19\\)\n\nEverything matches!\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nI've verified the equations with my solutions. So, the product \\(abc\\) is \\(-56\\). \n\nThis comprehensive approach guarantees the correctness of the answer through robust checks and logical deduction.",

  "ground_truth": "Summing all three equations yields that $5a + 5b + 5c = -3 + 9 + 19 = 25$. Thus, $a + b + c = 5$. Subtracting this from each of the given equations, we obtain that $2a = -8, 2b = 4, 2c = 14$. Thus, $a = -4, b = 2, c =7$, and their product is $abc = -4 \\times 2 \\times 7 = \\boxed{-56}$."
