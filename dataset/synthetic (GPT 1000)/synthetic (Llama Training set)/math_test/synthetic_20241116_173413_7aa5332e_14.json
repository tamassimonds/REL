    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and explore it step-by-step, keeping in mind the different strategies and checks we might perform as we go along.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts:\n\n- We have a regular pentagon $ABCDE$. This is a five-sided polygon with all sides and angles equal.\n- We are attaching two equilateral triangles to this pentagon. Each triangle can be attached at one of the pentagon's sides.\n- We need to count the number of non-congruent figures we can create.\n\n#### Important Considerations:\n\n- Congruence: Two figures are congruent if they are identical in shape and size, possibly through rotation or reflection.\n- Positions: We have five positions (sides of the pentagon) to choose from for the attachments, but the triangles themselves might form shapes that are congruent through rotations or reflections.\n\n### Step 2: Visualizing and Brainstorming\n\nLet's brainstorm how to approach the problem:\n\n- One approach is to explicitly enumerate all combinations of attaching two triangles and then check for congruence among the combinations.\n- Alternatively, symmetry considerations could simplify the task. The pentagon's symmetry may reduce the number of truly distinct arrangements.\n\nOh! This reminds me of the concept of combination and symmetry in polygons. We definitely want to leverage the symmetry of the pentagon.\n\n### Step 3: Generating Combinations\n\nThere are \\(\\binom{5}{2} = 10\\) ways to choose two sides from five to attach the triangles. However, we need to consider symmetry:\n\n1. **Check for intrinsic symmetry of the pentagon**: The pentagon is symmetric under rotations (by multiples of 72 degrees) and reflections (across lines through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side).\n\n2. **Consider specific arrangements**:\n    - Attach triangles to any two adjacent sides.\n    - Attach triangles to two non-adjacent sides.\n\nHmm... Let's move forward by considering these cases:\n\n- Two triangles on consecutive sides: Due to rotational symmetry, this should count as one distinct shape.\n- Two triangles on non-adjacent sides: We explore the possibility of distinct shapes based on the number of sides between the attached triangles.\n\n### Step 4: Categorizing and Counting\n\n1. **Adjacent sides**: Challenge is if a rotation or reflection makes them identical. Thanks to symmetry, attaching triangles on two adjacent sides should form one unique shape.\n\n2. **Check for patterns with non-adjacent sides**:\n    - **With one side in between**: Move triangles over different positions but checking if rotating produces a non-distinct shape.\n    - **With two sides in between**: Similar check needed.\n\nBy now, it seems evident that the rotational symmetry simplifies to fewer configurations. Let's use more systematic count.\n\n### Step 5: Reducing Through Symmetry Consideration\n\nReflect:\n\n- We identified that consecutive sides offer one shape.\n- Adjacent plus next non-adjacent: Consider and verify distinction under symmetric transformations.\n\nTo decide between distinct figures and those concealably identical through symmetries:\n\n1. **Explore: Consecutively along edges**:\n    - One configuration for each pair of adjacent sides.\n    - Check rotational equivalencies.\n\n2. **Explore: Every non-adjacent possibility**:\n    - Ensure each is considered for unique rotations.\n    - Pay attention when sides between triangles have symmetry roles, like diagonals through pentagon.\n\n### Checking:\n\n- Double check if transformations can tumble shapes into repeats.\n- Each arrangement appreciably double-checks if no two are indistinguishable when pivoted.\n\nFinally, the non-redundant configurations boil down to a small number due to symmetry considerations.\n\n### Conclusion and Result\n\nDue to symmetry:\n\n1. **Adjacently placed triangles**: One distinct configuration.\n2. **Non-Adjacent cases**: Include any spacing up to the opposite sides as potentially distinct arrangements.\n\nBased on systematic arrangement and re-evaluation, and considering pentagon symmetry with careful transformations:\n\n- We conclude with 3 non-congruent figure arrangements. This confirms that through these transformations and positional checks, we ensure no overlapping configurations mistaken for unique by naive view without symmetry comparison.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous response. Let's take a closer look at the problem and re-evaluate our approach to ensure we have the correct solution.\n\n### Reflecting on and Revisiting Initial Steps\n\nPreviously, I attempted to categorize the figures based on symmetry considerations and adjacent versus non-adjacent sides, exploring the notion of congruence under transformations. However, upon further inspection, it's clear that I overlooked some key aspects. Let's address these properly:\n\n### Re-examining the Combinatorial Arrangements\n\n1. **Reconsidering Attachments:**\n   - Let's fix one triangle at a consistent position for simplicity. Assume it's attached to side $\\overline{AB}$.\n   - The task becomes determining where the second triangle can be added without resulting in a figure that can be transformed (via rotations or reflections) into a previously counted figure.\n\n2. **Focusing on Non-congruence:**\n   - For each additional attachment, check if the resulting figure is unique, based not solely on the physical connections but also on symmetry transformations.\n\n### Strategy Correction and New Exploration\n\n- **Fixed Attachments:**\n  - Attach the first triangle to $\\overline{AB}$. Then explore options for the second triangle.\n  \n- **Exploring New Configuration Possibilities:**\n  - If the second triangle is attached to $\\overline{BC}$ or $\\overline{CD}$, initially these might seem non-congruent due to their relative placements.\n  - If the second triangle is attached to $\\overline{AE}$ or $\\overline{DE}$, reflect on how symmetry (like the vertical axis of the pentagon) can affect congruence.\n\n### Corrected Evaluation\n\nBy systematic exploration:\n\n- **Triangles at Adjacent Sides:**\n  - Attaching to $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ or $\\overline{CD}$ creates distinct shapes. As rotations or reflections along the pentagonal symmetry do not result in identical figures across these pairings.\n\n- **Reflections and Rotations:**\n  - Placing a triangle at $\\overline{AE}$ or $\\overline{DE}$ while the first is at $\\overline{AB}$ can indeed be reflected back to arrangements that are already counted, confirming redundancy in configuration.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nTaking a more refined approach to symmetry and congruence checks, the actual count, leveraging fixed positions and reflective symmetry, simplifies the number of non-congruent figures to two configurations:\n\n- **Two Distinct Non-congruent Figures:**\n  - One triangle attached to $\\overline{AB}$, the second to either $\\overline{BC}$ or $\\overline{CD}$.\n\nThus, realizing through this refined approach, the correct number of non-congruent figures that can be constructed is indeed $\\boxed{2}$. This solution respects the inherent symmetry of the regular pentagon and the congruence relations created by its geometry.",

The second triangle can be attached to $\\overline{BC}$ or $\\overline{CD}$ to obtain two non-congruent figures. If the second triangle is attached to $\\overline{AE}$ or to $\\overline{DE}$, the figure can be reflected about the vertical axis of symmetry of the pentagon to obtain one of the two already counted. Thus the total is $\\boxed{2}$."
