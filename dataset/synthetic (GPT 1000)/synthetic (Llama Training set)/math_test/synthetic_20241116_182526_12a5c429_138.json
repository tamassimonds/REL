    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts: The expression we have is \\(|a-b| + a + b\\) and we're given the condition \\(a < b\\). At first glance, this reminds me of absolute value properties, but I need to think about it carefully to ensure I don't overlook anything. Absolute values can sometimes be tricky based on which variable is larger, though here, \\(a < b\\) simplifies things a bit.\n\n**Consider the Absolute Value**\n\n1. **Absolute Value Analysis**:\n    \\[\n    |a-b| \\text{ essentially measures the \"distance\" between } a \\text{ and } b.\n    \\]\n    Since we are given \\(a < b\\), \\(b\\) is larger than \\(a\\). This means that: \n    \\[\n    |a-b| = b-a \\quad \\text{because } b-a \\text{ is already non-negative}.\n    \\]\n\n2. **Substitute the Absolute Value**:\n    With this substitution, the expression \\(|a-b| + a + b\\) becomes:\n    \\[\n    (b-a) + a + b\n    \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Expression**:\n    Let's simplify:\n    \\[\n    b-a + a + b = b + b - a + a \n    \\]\n\n    Combine terms:\n    \\[\n    = 2b\n    \\]\n\n4. **Reflect a Bit**:\n    A quick check to ensure this makes sense with potential simple values. If \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 3\\), our expression \\(|1 - 3| + 1 + 3\\) should indeed give:\n    \\[\n    |1-3| + 1 + 3 = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6\n    \\]\n    And \\(2b\\) with \\(b = 3\\) is also:\n    \\[\n    2 \\times 3 = 6\n    \\]\n    So, it holds up!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nReflecting on all the steps, everything appears consistent and checks out with examples. Therefore, the value of \\(|a-b| + a + b\\) given \\(a < b\\) is:\n\\[\n2b\n\\]\n\nThinking this through and double-checking the math reassures me that this interpretation of the conditions and expression is correct.",
