    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. We need to find the sum of the digits of \\( n \\), where \\( n \\) is the product of the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers. Here's my thought process:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the problem\n\nWe're asked for the sum of the digits of a specific number \\( n \\). To find \\( n \\), we need the product of the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers. The problem boils down to identifying these two smallest 3-digit primes and calculating their product.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the first strategy\n\nInitially, I think it's straightforward: find the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers. But wait, how do I efficiently identify prime numbers? Maybe a quick check of each 3-digit number or using prime number tests could help.\n\n### Step 3: Find the smallest 3-digit prime number\n\nLet's consider the smallest possible 3-digit number, which is 100. Clearly, it's even, so it's not prime. The next odd number is 101. \n\nFor 101 to be prime, it must not be divisible by any prime number less than its square root (approximately 10). These primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n- **101 is not divisible by 2**, it's odd.\n- **101 is not divisible by 3** (sum of digits 1 + 0 + 1 = 2, not divisible by 3).\n- **101 is not divisible by 5**, it doesn't end in 0 or 5.\n- **101 is not divisible by 7**: Quick calculation shows \\( 101 \\div 7 \\approx 14.428 \\), not an integer.\n\nSince 101 is not divisible by any of these, it must be prime.\n\n### Step 4: Find the second smallest 3-digit prime number\n\nRight after 101 is 103. Let's check if it's prime:\n\n- **103 is not divisible by 2**, it's odd.\n- **103 is not divisible by 3** (sum of digits 1 + 0 + 3 = 4, not divisible by 3).\n- **103 is not divisible by 5**, it doesn't end in 0 or 5.\n- **103 is not divisible by 7**: Quick calculation shows \\( 103 \\div 7 \\approx 14.714 \\), not an integer.\n\nConfirmed! 103 is also prime.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the product\n\nNow, we need the product of these two primes:\n\\[ n = 101 \\times 103 \\]\n\nLet's multiply them:\n\\[ \n101 \\times 103 = 101 \\times (100 + 3) = 101 \\times 100 + 101 \\times 3 \n\\]\n\nCarrying out the calculations:\n\\[ \n101 \\times 100 = 10100 \n\\]\n\\[ \n101 \\times 3 = 303 \n\\]\n\nNow, add these results:\n\\[ \n10100 + 303 = 10403 \n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Find the sum of the digits of \\( n \\)\n\nNow, I'll find the sum of the digits of \\( n = 10403 \\):\n\n- The digits of 10403 are 1, 0, 4, 0, 3.\n- Calculate the sum: \\( 1 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 3 = 8 \\).\n\n### Step 7: Verification\n\nLet me just re-check this quickly. The product calculation seems straightforward, and verification shows each primality test was correct. The digit sum looks correct as well.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sum of the digits of \\( n \\), where \\( n \\) is the product of the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers, is \\( \\boxed{8} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "To test for primes, we start from 100 and work upward: 100 is not prime, 101 is prime, 102 is not prime; 103 is prime.  Hence the two smallest 3-digit prime numbers are 101 and 103; their product is \\[n=(101)(103)=101(100+3)=10100+303=10403.\\]Finally, the sum of the digits of $n$ is $1+0+4+0+3=\\boxed{8}$."
