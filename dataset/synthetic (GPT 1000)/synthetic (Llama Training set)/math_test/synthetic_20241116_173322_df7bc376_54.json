    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem:\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- When I see a problem involving angles on a clock, I immediately think about how each hour and each minute translate to degrees on the clock face. This seems familiar to other problems I've encountered where the clock face is treated as a circle.\n  \n- The question is asking for the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the minute and hour hands at 8:00. My initial thought is that this involves calculating the position of each hand in degrees and then determining the angle between them.\n\n**Exploration of Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Hour Hand Position:**\n   - At 8:00, the hour hand is on the 8. This makes me think about splitting the entire clock face, which is 360 degrees, into 12 sections (12 hours). Each hour must therefore represent \\(\\frac{360}{12} = 30\\) degrees.\n   - Since the hour hand is at 8, I multiply: \\(8 \\times 30 = 240\\) degrees from the 12:00 position.\n\n2. **Minute Hand Position:**\n   - At exactly 8:00, the minute hand is on the 12. Zero minutes could mean it directly aligns with the 360-degree point or 0 degree point on a typical circle because it's starting anew after completing one full cycle.\n   - In simpler terms, zero minutes past an hour mean the minute hand points at the 60-minute mark, or 0 degrees.\n\n3. **Calculating the Angle Between the Hands:**\n   - Now I need to find the smaller angle between the two hands. My mind imagines the clock face: \n     - The hour hand is at 240 degrees.\n     - The minute hand at 0 degrees.\n   - Taking the absolute difference gives: \\(|240 - 0| = 240\\) degrees.\n\n4. **Checking for the Smaller Angle:**\n   - Wait, the clock is circular, meaning anything above 180 degrees counts as the larger angle \u2014 realizing this, I know the question asks for the smaller angle.\n   - Thus, the smaller angle would be \\(360 - 240 = 120\\) degrees.\n\n**Reflecting:**\n\n- At first, I thought the angle of 240 degrees was the answer, but upon checking the context of the question \u2014 looking for the smaller angle \u2014 120 degrees is correct.\n- I can visualize this clearly now, imagining starting at 0 and sweeping clockwise first through 240 degrees to 8, with the return trip through the remaining 120 degrees being the smaller arc.\n\n**Final Thoughts and Quick Check:**\n\n- To ensure the accuracy, let's quickly summarize: 30 degrees per hour, placement at 8 gives 240 degrees, compared to 0 degrees for the minute hand. Subtracting correctly reflects the smaller measure as 120 degrees.\n- Seems correct upon review, no calculation hiccups observed.\n  \n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands at 8:00 is 120 degrees.",

  "ground_truth": "The hour hand is at $8$ and the minute hand is at $12$, which span 4 hours.  Each hour on the 12-hour analog clock spans $360/12=30$ degrees, so the angle formed here is $30\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{120}$ degrees."
