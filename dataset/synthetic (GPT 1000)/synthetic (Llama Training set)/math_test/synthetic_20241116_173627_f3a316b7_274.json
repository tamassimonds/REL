    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We need to solve the inequality \\(\\frac{1}{5}|9 + 2a| < 1\\) for \\(a\\) and express our answer in interval notation.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst things first: we have a fractional term and an absolute value. The inequality essentially says that \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) times the absolute value of \\((9 + 2a)\\) needs to be less than 1. My initial thought is to get rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides by 5.\n\n### Step 2: Eliminate the Fraction\nBy multiplying both sides of \\(\\frac{1}{5}|9 + 2a| < 1\\) by 5, we get:\n\n\\[ |9 + 2a| < 5 \\]\n\nThis is simpler and more familiar to tackle. We are now dealing with a standard absolute value inequality.\n\n### Step 3: Split the Absolute Value Inequality\nWe know that for any expression \\(|X| < b\\), where \\(b\\) is positive, we can write this as \\(-b < X < b\\). Applying that to our inequality:\n\n\\[ -5 < 9 + 2a < 5 \\]\n\nOkay, we have two inequalities to solve: \\(-5 < 9 + 2a\\) and \\(9 + 2a < 5\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solve Each Inequality Separately\n\n**For \\(-5 < 9 + 2a\\):**\n\n1. Subtract 9 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   -5 - 9 < 2a \\implies -14 < 2a\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide each term by 2:\n   \\[\n   -7 < a\n   \\]\n\n**For \\(9 + 2a < 5\\):**\n\n1. Subtract 9 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2a < 5 - 9 \\implies 2a < -4\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide each term by 2:\n   \\[\n   a < -2\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Combine Solutions\nI have solved each inequality separately, and now it's time to combine them to find the range of \\(a\\):\n\nFrom \\(-7 < a\\) and \\(a < -2\\), a must satisfy both inequalities simultaneously. Therefore, I conclude:\n\n\\[\n-7 < a < -2\n\\]\n\nThis translates to interval notation as: \\((-7, -2)\\).\n\n### Step 6: Reflect on the Solution\nLet's take a moment to make sure everything fits. My steps involved:\n- Converting an absolute inequality into a double inequality.\n- Independently solving each part.\n- Combining results to find intersections, ensuring I consider both sides.\n\nOur solution \\((-7, -2)\\) seems consistent with the conditions set by the original inequality. \n\nOverall, this was a solid approach to unpacking the absolute value inequality. Always good to remember basic strategies for absolute values and how to isolate terms in inequalities. Everything checks out, so I'm confident in my final answer of \\((-7, -2)\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Multiplying by 5 gives $|9+2a|<5$, so we must have  $$-5 < 9+2a < 5.$$Subtracting 9 from all three parts of this inequality chain gives  $$-14 < 2a < -4,$$and dividing by 2 gives $-7 < a < -2,$ or $a \\in \\boxed{(-7, -2)}$ in interval notation."
