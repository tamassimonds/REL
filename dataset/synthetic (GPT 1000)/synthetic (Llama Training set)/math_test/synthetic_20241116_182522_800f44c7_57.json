    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We're tasked with rationalizing the denominator in the expression \\(\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}\\).\n\nFirst thoughts:\n   \n- The concept of \"rationalizing the denominator\" involves removing the square root from the denominator. This is done by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by a conjugate or a similar expression that will eliminate the radical in the denominator. This reminds me of problems I've seen before where we multiply by the same radical present in the denominator.\n\nExploring a range of strategies:\n\n- One immediate approach that comes to mind is multiplying the numerator and the denominator by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), because doing this involves one of the universal techniques for rationalizing denominators. So, let me try this method.\n\nCalculating:\n\n1. Multiply the numerator and the denominator by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplifying the expression:\n   - In the numerator, \\(5 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 5\\sqrt{3}\\).\n   - In the denominator, \\(\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3} = 3\\).\n\n   So, the expression becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n   \\]\n\nChecking my work:\n\n- I know that multiplying a radical by itself gives the radicand (the number under the square root), so \\(\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3} = 3\\) is correct.\n- The numerator, \\(5 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 5\\sqrt{3}\\), should be a straightforward multiplication.\n  \nReflection:\n\n- By converting \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) in the denominator to a simple integer, I think I've correctly rationalized the denominator. The rationalization process is correct since the denominator no longer contains a radical, and the final expression is \\(\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).\n\nConsideration of other methods briefly:\n\n- There's not really a simpler or different approach needed for basic square roots other than multiplying by such radicals themselves. If the problem involved more complex denominators like binomials with radicals, I might need to consider conjugates, but for this, the chosen strategy seems direct and effective.\n\nConcluding thoughts:\n\n- The solution I arrived at appears accurate, given the straightforward use of multiplication by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\). Overall, simplifying radicals and rationalizing is a comfortable method I recognize, and applying it here verifies the logic and accuracy of my solution.\n\nSo, our final expression with a rationalized denominator is:\n\\[\n\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]",
