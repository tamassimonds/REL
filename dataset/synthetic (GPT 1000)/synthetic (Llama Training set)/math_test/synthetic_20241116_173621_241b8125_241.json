    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: \"Find the smallest number \\( y \\) such that \\( y^2 = 81 \\).\"\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nWhen I first see \\( y^2 = 81 \\), it looks like a classic problem involving square roots. At first glance, I'm reminded of problems where I've had to find the value of a variable that satisfies a simple equation like this. The goal is to solve for \\( y \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Equation\nThe equation \\( y^2 = 81 \\) essentially asks me to find a number \\( y \\) that, when squared, equals 81. A natural step is to consider the square root of 81 because squaring and square rooting are inverse operations.\n\n### Step 2: Different Approaches and Considerations\n\n1. **Consider Positive and Negative Roots:**\n   - The square root of 81 is typically taught as 9, since \\( 9 \\times 9 = 81 \\). \n   - However, it\u2019s important to consider that both \\( 9 \\) and \\( -9 \\) are valid solutions here, because \\( (-9) \\times (-9) = 81 \\) as well. Square any positive or negative number and the result is positive.\n\n2. **The Problem Specifically Asks for the Smallest \\( y \\):**\n   - Among the numbers \\( 9 \\) and \\( -9 \\), \\( -9 \\) is actually smaller than \\( 9 \\).\n\n### Reflecting on the Approach\nHmm, let's pause and think. The problem asks specifically for the smallest number \\( y \\). I almost overlooked this aspect when initially confirming 9 and -9 as solutions, but the smallest would have to be -9.\n\n### Quick Check on Solutions\nLet's check if this makes sense:\n- \\( (-9)^2 = (-9) \\times (-9) = 81 \\). Okay, confirmed that -9 is indeed a solution.\n- Comparatively, \\( 9^2 = 81 \\) is also correct, but 9 is not the smallest.\n\n### Additional Thoughts\nThis reminds me of problems where forgetting about negative roots can lead to incomplete solutions, especially when squaring equations.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe smallest number \\( y \\) such that \\( y^2 = 81 \\) is \\( y = -9 \\). \n\nIt\u2019s fulfilling to solve these kinds of equations step-by-step, considering both directions of root signs. Always remember that taking the square root could yield both positive and negative results, and the context (like asking for the smallest) directs us to the correct solution.",
