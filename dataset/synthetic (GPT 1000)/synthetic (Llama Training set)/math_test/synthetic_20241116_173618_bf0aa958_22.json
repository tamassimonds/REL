    "working_out": "Alright, let's get into this problem with a lot of thought and introspection as if we're actually working through it together.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nI'm seeing that we have a sphere inscribed in a cone. The cone\u2019s height is 4, and its base radius is 3. I need to find the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cone. \n\nFirst thoughts:\n- I know the basic formulas: the volume of a sphere is \\((4/3) \\pi r^3\\) and the volume of a cone is \\((1/3) \\pi R^2 h\\).\n- But wait, the challenge is that the sphere is inscribed inside the cone, which means its diameter is less than the height of the cone. So I need to find that sphere's radius first.\n- This seems familiar\u2014I think there's a relationship involving the geometry of the inscribed sphere in a cone. Let me delve into that relationship.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Geometry\nI could try a couple of approaches here:\n\n**Geometry Insight:**\n- Considering a cross-section through the axis of the cone and sphere, we get an isosceles triangle with a circle inside it.\n- Intuitively, I feel like using similar triangles might be a good path to explore the relations.\n\nLet's try visualizing:\n- The height of the cone is 4.\n- The base radius of the cone is 3, which means for the cross-section, the base is 6.\n  \n**Using Tangent Like Approach:**\n- The sphere is tangent to the sides of the cone and the base. There's a formula involving the inscribed sphere: \\(r = \\frac{R \\cdot h}{\\sqrt{R^2 + h^2} + h}\\) for a right cone.\n- Let's break this down using the geometry principles: Since the sphere's top touches the cone's slant, any vertical line through the center shares its height with the vertex of the cone.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Right Approach\n\nOkay, let's use a coordinate approach since often this helps me visualize:\n\n**Center of the Sphere:**\n- The sphere is tangent at the cone's vertex and slant height.\n- Radius \\(r\\) is the key for both equations of the area. So let\u2019s apply the tangent property:\n  \nFrom the apex of the cone to the center of the sphere in vertical cross-section, regenerate the cone configuration and find potential intersections.\n\n**Trying the formula:**\n- Let\u2019s compute the sphere radius using: \n  \\( r = \\frac{R \\cdot h}{\\sqrt{R^2 + h^2} + h}  \\)\n- Substitute the given values:\n  \\[ R = 3, \\, h = 4 \\]\n  \\[ r = \\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{\\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} + 4} \\]\n  \\[ r = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{9 + 16} + 4} = \\frac{12}{5 + 4} = \\frac{12}{9} = \\frac{4}{3} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Volumes\n\n- **Volume of the sphere:**\n  \\[ V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\cdot \\frac{64}{27} = \\frac{256}{81} \\pi \\]\n\n- **Volume of the cone:**\n  \\[ V_{\\text{cone}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi R^2 h = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 4 = 12 \\pi \\]\n\n### Step 5: Find the Ratio\n\nCalculate the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{sphere}}}{V_{\\text{cone}}} = \\frac{\\frac{256}{81} \\pi}{12 \\pi} = \\frac{256}{81} \\cdot \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{256}{972} \\]\n\nNow simplify that:\n\n\\[ = \\frac{64}{243} \\]\n\n### Step 6: Reflection and Conclusion\n\nReflecting on these steps, it all seems to logically follow standard principles and calculations involving inscribed solid figures. My final ratio \\(\\frac{64}{243}\\) roughly lines up with what I would expect given the strategy employed (geometry and application of a known formula for such a situation). It makes sense and appears consistent. \n\nThis approach was a little nuanced, but the critical connection of the radius calculation through geometry was key. Let's conclude with confidence in this ratio.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial solution. Let's go back and re-evaluate the problem with a fresh perspective and attempt to discover where my earlier approach went astray.\n\n### Reflecting and Re-evaluating\n\nTo start, I'll brainstorm the central elements involved and consider a range of strategies for determining the radius of the inscribed sphere. The main objective remains to find the ratio of the volumes, but first, we must ensure the calculation of the inscribed sphere\u2019s radius is correct.\n\n### Step 1: Reconsidering the Geometry\n\nPreviously, I attempted to calculate the radius directly using a formula, but now I'll revisit the geometry of the cross-section, which is an isosceles triangle:\n\n1. **Identifying Key Geometric Properties:**\n   - The triangle in question has a base of 6 (derived from the diameter of the cone's base) and a height of 4.\n   - Using the Pythagorean theorem, each of the equal sides of this triangle is 5, because \\( \\sqrt{(3)^2 + (4)^2} = 5 \\).\n\n2. **Finding the Radius of the Inscribed Circle:**\n   - I recall that the area of a triangle can also be expressed in terms of its semiperimeter and the radius of its incircle, where Area = \\( \\text{semiperimeter} \\times \\rho \\).\n   - **Calculate Semi-perimeter**: \\( s = \\frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} = \\frac{5 + 5 + 6}{2} = 8 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Correcting the Radius Calculation\n\nTo find the radius (\\(\\rho\\)) of the inscribed circle:\n\n1. **Expressing Area with Height and Base:**\n   - The area is also \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 4 = 12 \\).\n\n2. **Using Area Formula with Inscribed Radius:**\n   - \\( 12 = \\rho \\times 8 \\) implies \\(\\rho = \\frac{12}{8} = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Recalculate Volumes\n\nWith this recalculated radius of the inscribed sphere, proceed with the volume calculations:\n\n- **Volume of the Sphere:**\n  \\[\n  V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\cdot \\frac{27}{8} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 27}{24} \\pi = \\frac{9}{2} \\pi\n  \\]\n\n- **Volume of the Cone:**\n  \\[\n  V_{\\text{cone}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 4 = \\frac{36}{3} \\pi = 12 \\pi\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Correct Ratio\n\nFinally, calculate the ratio of the volumes:\n\n- **Ratio of Volumes:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{V_{\\text{sphere}}}{V_{\\text{cone}}} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{2} \\pi}{12 \\pi} = \\frac{9}{24} = \\frac{3}{8}\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOn reflecting through different methods and analyzing the geometric properties more keenly, my revised approach has led me to a much more plausible solution: the correct ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cone is indeed \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\). This process highlights the importance of meticulous calculation and thorough understanding of the geometric relations involved, ensuring accuracy in mathematical problem-solving.",

  "ground_truth": "We start by finding the radius of the inscribed sphere. If we slice the diagram by a plane that contains the central axis of the cone, we get a circle inscribed in an isosceles triangle with base 6 and height 4, and the radius of the inscribed circle is the same as the radius of the sphere (since any plane that contains the central axis of the cone contains a diameter of the inscribed sphere).

Similarly, segment $CB$ has length 5.  Now, the area of triangle $ABC$ is equal to the semiperimeter times the radius of the inscribed circle. On the other hand, we know that the area of $ABC$ is also  \\[\\frac{1}{2} AC \\cdot DB = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4 = 24/2. \\]Let $\\rho$ be the radius of the inscribed circle, and let $s$ be the semiperimeter of $ABC$.
