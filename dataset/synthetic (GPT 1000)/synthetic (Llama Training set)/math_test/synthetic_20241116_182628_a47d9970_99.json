    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step and tackle each piece with a thoughtful approach.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nWhen I first look at the equations given, they seem related to inverse variables and a combination of polynomial expressions. This reminds me of some algebraic substitution techniques I've used before. However, I\u2019m not entirely sure how to relate them to the quantity \\(x^2y + xy^2\\) just yet. Let's try to brainstorm some possible strategies to approach this.\n\n### Understanding the Given Equations\n1. The first equation is \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = 5\\). This equation is in terms of the reciprocals of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) \u2013 typically, these can be combined or substituted to find a more useful form.\n  \n2. The second equation is \\(3xy + x + y = 4\\). This mixes products of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) with their linear sums. Seems a bit complex \u2013 what if I simplify it or try substituting values from the first equation?\n\n### Strategy Brainstorm\n\n- **Substitution**: \n  - Perhaps manipulating the first equation could give me something helpful to substitute into the second? \n  - Specifically, the sum of reciprocals often suggests a harmonic mean type strategy or direct substitution for expressions involving \\(x+y\\) and \\(xy\\).\n\n- **Elimination or Direct Calculation**:\n  - Maybe eliminate one of the variables between these two equations to solve for the other?\n  \n- **Express in Terms of New Variables**: Introduce new variables such as \\(u = x+y\\) and \\(v = xy\\) and rewrite the equations in terms of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\).\n\n### Exploring Substitution\nRearrange the first equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{x+y}{xy} = 5 \\implies x+y = 5xy\n\\]\n\nThis expression for \\(x+y\\) could be useful for substituting back into the second equation.\n\n### Check First Insight with Substitution\n- Replace \\(x+y\\) in the second equation:\n\n\\[ \n3xy + x + y = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3xy + 5xy = 4 \n\\]\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n\\[ \n8xy = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad xy = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\nThis looks promising. Solving a product equation can often unlock polynomial expressions involving powers of the variables.\n\n### Find Expression for \\(x^2y + xy^2\\)\nNext, observe that:\n\n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = xy(x+y)\n\\]\n\nI already have \\(xy = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and from \\(x+y = 5xy\\):\n\n\\[\nx+y = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\nx^2y + xy^2 = xy (x+y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\n### Checking the Work\nEverything thus far seems consistent:\n- Substituting \\(x+y = \\frac{5}{2}\\) and \\(xy = \\frac{1}{2}\\) aligns with our manipulation of equations.\n- Both outcomes appropriately support the solution for \\(x^2y + xy^2\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe calculated value for \\(x^2y + xy^2\\) is \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\), verified by consistent application of algebraic manipulation and substitution appropriate for expressions involving sums and products of variables. My deductions align with the structure of the problem, and the key breakthroughs were the simplification steps with the variable expressions in terms of \\(x+y\\) and \\(xy\\). \n\nFeeling good about this approach, and I've addressed each piece logically to come to this result!",

  "ground_truth": "The first equation becomes\n\n$$\\frac{x+y}{xy}=5\\Rightarrow x+y=5xy.$$\n\nSubstituting into the second equation,\n\n$$8xy=4\\Rightarrow xy=\\frac{1}{2}.$$\n\nThus $x+y=\\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nThe quantity we desire factors as $xy(x+y)$, so it is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{4}}$."
