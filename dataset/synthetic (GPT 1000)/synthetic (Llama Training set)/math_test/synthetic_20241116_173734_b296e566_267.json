    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by breaking it down step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe problem is asking for the result of the expression \\((1 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5) \\div 11\\).\n\nAt first glance, this looks like a straightforward arithmetic problem, but we need to take it one step at a time. The expression inside the parentheses must be evaluated first, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating Inside the Parentheses**\n\nThe expression inside the parentheses is \\(1 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5\\).\n\nI notice that I need to handle the multiplication part first:\n\n- Calculate \\(2 \\cdot 3 = 6\\).\n- Next, calculate \\(6 \\cdot 4 = 24\\).\n- Then, calculate \\(24 \\cdot 5 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the multiplication part of the expression simplifies to \\(120\\).\n\n**Step 3: Completing the Parentheses Calculation**\n\nNow, add the result from the multiplication to the number one:  \n\\[1 + 120 = 121\\]\n\nSo, \\( (1 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5) \\) equals \\( 121 \\).\n\n**Step 4: Division**\n\nNow, the next step according to the original problem is to divide the result by 11:\n\n\\[121 \\div 11\\]\n\nI'm not entirely sure off the top of my head what 121 divided by 11 is, so I\u2019ll calculate it:\n\n- 11 times 11 is 121.\n\nTherefore, \\(121 \\div 11 = 11\\).\n\n**Step 5: Reflect and Check**\n\n- The calculation of \\(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5\\) seemed large but calculating each step individually seemed correct.\n- Adding 1 to 120 results in a straightforward 121.\n- Dividing 121 by 11 returned an integer, suggesting my steps were correct.\n\nThis looks consistent and correct. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a mistake in my calculations or steps. Each part of the math follows logically and I double-checked the division step.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on all my calculations and checks, the answer to the problem \\((1 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5) \\div 11\\) is 11. \n\nReflecting on the process, the use of proper order of operations and checking each step closely ensured the accuracy of the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we evaluate the expression in the parentheses. Since multiplication has precedence over addition, $1 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 1 + 120 = 121$. Our original expression evaluates to $(1 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5) \\div 11 = 121 \\div 11 = \\boxed{11}.$"
