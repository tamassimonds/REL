    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\nOkay, the problem is asking for \\( f(f(1)) \\). This is a function composition, where we first find \\( f(1) \\) and then plug that result into \\( f \\) again. This does remind me of nesting functions, which I've done before. My initial reaction is to evaluate these one step at a time.\n\n**Step 1: Evaluating \\( f(1) \\)**\n\nThe function is defined as \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x + 2} \\). \n\nLet's plug \\( 1 \\) into the function:\n\n\\[ f(1) = \\frac{1}{1 + 2} = \\frac{1}{3}. \\]\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. I've calculated \\( f(1) \\) correctly as \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). No mistakes here as far as I can tell.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluating \\( f(f(1)) \\)**\n\nNow, we need to find \\( f(f(1)) \\), which means using our \\( f(1) \\) result as the new input for the function:\n\nSo given that \\( f(1) = \\frac{1}{3} \\), we have to find \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\).\n\nPlugging \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) into the function:\n\n\\[ f\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{3} + 2}. \\]\n\nHere, I need to be careful with the arithmetic when adding these fractions. I'm going to ensure I handle the sum in the denominator correctly:\n\nAdding \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) and \\(2\\):\n\nFirst, express \\(2\\) as a fraction: \\(\\frac{6}{3}\\).\n\nThen, \n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} + 2 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{6}{3} = \\frac{7}{3}. \\]\n\nSo, now I have \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{3}} \\).\n\nWhen you have a fraction within a fraction like \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{3}}\\), you multiply by the reciprocal of the inner fraction:\n\n\\[ f\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 1 \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}. \\]\n\n**Checking the result:**\n\nThis feels right since I carefully managed the algebra involving the fractions. I\u2019ll just quickly verify my thought process: \n\n- Evaluated \\( f(1) \\) correctly as \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n- Substituted back into the function and evaluated \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\) as \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\).\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any missteps in the arithmetic or logic as I wrote it out clearly. The calculations consistently lead to the final answer of:\n\n\\[ f(f(1)) = \\frac{3}{7}. \\]\n\nAha, the problem felt complex at first, but isolating each function evaluation step made it manageable. Everything checks out, so I\u2019m confident in this final result.",
