    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem. At first glance, we're dealing with the intersection of two graphs, \\( y = x^4 \\) and \\( y = 5x^2 - 6 \\). The task is to identify the \\( x \\)-coordinates of the intersection points, which are given to be \\( \\pm \\sqrt{m} \\) and \\( \\pm \\sqrt{n} \\), and ultimately determine \\( m - n \\).\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Equation\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that at their points of intersection, the two expressions for \\( y \\) must be equal. So, let's set the equations equal to one another:\n\n\\[ x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Equation\n\nNow, rearrange this equation to bring everything to one side:\n\n\\[ x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic in form! Specifically, we can treat it like a quadratic equation in terms of \\( x^2 \\). Let's try a substitution.\n\n### Step 3: Substitution\n\nLet's use substitution to make things clearer.\nSet \\( z = x^2 \\). Then \\( z^2 = x^4 \\). So the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ z^2 - 5z + 6 = 0 \\]\n\nThis looks more familiar. Now we can try to factor this quadratic equation.\n\n### Step 4: Factor the Quadratic\n\nLook for two numbers that multiply to \\( +6 \\) and add up to \\(-5\\). After a moment, it clicks: the numbers are \\(-2\\) and \\(-3\\). So the factorization is:\n\n\\[ (z - 2)(z - 3) = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\( z \\)\n\nThe solutions for \\( z \\) are straightforward:\n\n\\[ z - 2 = 0 \\] leads to \\( z = 2 \\)\n\n\\[ z - 3 = 0 \\] leads to \\( z = 3 \\)\n\nNow recall that \\( z = x^2 \\), so:\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( x \\)\n\nFor \\( z = x^2 = 2 \\), we have \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nFor \\( z = x^2 = 3 \\), we have \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nThus, the \\( x \\)-coordinates of the intersection points are \\( \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( \\pm \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\n### Step 7: Identify \\( m \\) and \\( n \\)\n\nThe question specifies that the \\( x \\)-coordinates are \\( \\pm \\sqrt{m} \\) and \\( \\pm \\sqrt{n} \\), where \\( m > n \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( m \\) corresponds to the larger value, 3, and \\( n \\) corresponds to 2. \n\n### Step 8: Calculate \\( m - n \\)\n\nFinally, compute the difference:\n\n\\[ m - n = 3 - 2 = 1 \\]\n\n### Step 9: Reflect\n\nThis solution seems correct because we followed logical steps, starting from equating the functions to solve for intersection. Each step followed naturally, and we cross-checked this using substitution and factoring, both commonly reliable methods. \n\nSo, the answer is \\( m - n = 1 \\). \n\nEverything checks out.

  "ground_truth": "At the intersection points, the $y$-coordinates of the two graphs must be equal, so we have the equation $x^4=y=5x^2-6$, or $x^4=5x^2-6$. Putting all the terms on one side, we get $x^4-5x^2+6=0$. Factoring, we get $(x^2-3)(x^2-2)=0$, so $x^2-3=0 \\Rightarrow x=\\pm \\sqrt{3}$ or $x^2-2=0 \\Rightarrow x=\\pm \\sqrt{2}$. Thus, $m=3$ and $n=2$ and $m-n=\\boxed{1}$."
