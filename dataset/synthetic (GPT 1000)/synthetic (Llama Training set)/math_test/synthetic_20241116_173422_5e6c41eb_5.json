    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem in the natural, intuitive way it was laid out. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, let's break down the task. We need to spell \"MATH\" starting from the origin labeled as 'M'. \n\n- 'A's are one step from the origin: points (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), and (0,-1).\n- 'T's are two steps from the origin: points like (2,0), (1,1), etc.\n- 'H's are three steps away: points like (3,0), (2,1), etc.\n\nSounds like a path-finding problem on a grid where each step goes towards the respective letter label. \n\n**Brainstorming Paths:**\n\nSince we start at 'M' (the origin), our goal is to:\n1. Move to an 'A'.\n2. Move to a 'T'.\n3. Move to an 'H'.\n\nThis requires a sequence of steps that spells out each letter while considering that each letter in the sequence is exactly one step further than the previous one.\n\n**Breaking Down the Steps:**\n\nLet's visualize it:\n\n1. From the Origin (0,0), we can go to:\n   - (1,0) or (-1,0) or (0,1) or (0,-1)\n\nFor each of these, we then need to head towards a 'T'.\n\n2. If at (1, 0), possible 'T' destinations:\n   - (2,0), (1,1), (0,0), or (1,-1).\n   \n3. If at (-1, 0), possible 'T' destinations:\n   - (-2,0), (-1,1), (0,0), or (-1,-1).\n   \n4. If at (0, 1), possible 'T' destinations:\n   - (0,2), (1,1), (0,0), or (-1,1).\n\n5. If at (0, -1), possible 'T' destinations:\n   - (0,-2), (1,-1), (0,0), or (-1,-1).\n\nNow, from a 'T', we aim for an 'H'.\n\n**Adapting Strategic Steps:**\n\nAfter reaching any 'T', I see all the 'H' destinations echo the 'T' approach from varying new spots. The sequence should consistently follow a strict step increment (1\u21922\u21923).\n\n**Calculating Paths:**\n\nSince this table starts getting complicated, let's use combinatorics to explore path numbers from (0,0) to three steps out.\n\n- At step 1 (an 'A'), we have 4 'A's.\n- At step 2 (a 'T'), from any given 'A', we have 4 ways to reach a 'T'\n- At step 3, from any 'T', another 4 paths to \u2018H\u2019\n\nSo: 4 (1st step) * 4 (2nd step) * 4 (3rd step) = 64.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nWait, let's walk through this logically:\n\nAm I considering repeat positions from dead paths? Maybe. Did I overlap paths? Let\u2019s visualize again using distance maps. Re-running needs a verification to rule out any overlap assumptions. Given the simplicity of grid steps downward/checking, 64 seems feasible when accounting the freedom in 90-degree turns on grids without reuse.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter re-tracing logical steps, considering each move: Yes, each Omnibus route seems consistent in covering row-space without repetition. \n\nThus, the total number of discernable paths is **64** ways to spell MATH.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial calculation. Let's re-evaluate the strategy and work through the problem again with a more refined approach.\n\n**Reflecting on Initial Steps:**\n\nInitially, I assumed a straightforward path calculation without adequately considering the specific paths from each letter point. Let's take a closer look at the process:\n\n**Strategic Re-evaluation:**\n\n1. **Step 1 (Reach 'A'):** From the origin 'M', there are indeed four possible 'A' points: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), and (0,-1).\n\n2. **Step 2 (Reach 'T'):** From each 'A', we need to consider specific 'T' points we can reach. For instance, from (0, -1), the possible 'T' points are (0, -2), (1, -1), and (-1, -1). Previously, I generalized these paths without considering the limitations of specific routes.\n\n3. **Step 3 (Reach 'H'):** From each 'T', again, we must focus on eligible 'H' points. For example, from (0, -2), the possible endpoint 'H' would be (0, -3), (1, -2), and (-1, -2).\n\n**Exploring the Correct Count:**\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by analyzing a case systematically and see if our route yields a consistent conclusion with a grounded understanding.\n\n1. **From an 'A'** (consider the bottom 'A' at (0, -1)):\n   - Potential 'T' points are: (0, -2), (1, -1), (-1, -1).\n\n2. **From 'T' (for each of the above):**\n   - At (0, -2), 'H' can be: (0, -3), (1, -2), or (-1, -2).\n   - At (1, -1) and (-1, -1), 'H' can be: (2, -1) or (1, -2) & (-2, -1) or (-1, -2) respectively.\n\nLet's calculate the number of distinct paths:\n- For (0, -1) to (0, -2), there are 3 'H' options.\n- For (0, -1) to (1, -1), there are 2 'H' options.\n- For (0, -1) to (-1, -1), there are 2 'H' options.\n\nThis gives us $3 + 2 + 2 = 7$ paths from the starting 'A' at (0, -1).\n\nSince the grid is symmetric, each starting 'A' provides the same number of paths: 7. Thus, multiplying by the 4 'A's, we have:\n\n\\[ 4 \\cdot 7 = 28 \\]\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nMy initial oversight was not appreciating the specific routes and destination constraints, but upon this recalibration and detailed path assessment, the total number of distinct paths to spell MATH is indeed \\(\\boxed{28}\\). This matches the corrected approach and verifies our understanding of grid navigation.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial calculation.
