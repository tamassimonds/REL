    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're tasked with figuring out how many ounces of white jelly beans Alexa should add to her mixture to reach a whole number of pounds. I'll think through this step by step, exploring different approaches and checking as I go.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nAt first glance, it seems like a problem about finding the right amount to reach a specific weight. I'm given two portions of jelly beans and need to understand that 1 pound equals 16 ounces. I'm starting with 8 ounces of red and 13 ounces of green jelly beans. So, first, I need to find out how many ounces I have in total.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Ounces**\n\nFirst thought: Add up the weights of the red and green jelly beans. \n\n- Red jelly beans: 8 ounces\n- Green jelly beans: 13 ounces\n\nLet's add these together:  \n\\[ 8 \\text{ ounces} + 13 \\text{ ounces} = 21 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nHmm, so we're starting with 21 ounces. To check my thought here: 21 ounces is not a whole number of pounds because 16 ounces make a pound. If I divide 21 by 16, it doesn't come out to a clean number. \n\n**Step 3: Determine the Nearest Pound**\n\nAlright, now I\u2019m going to find out how far away 21 ounces is from the next whole number of pounds. If I have 21 ounces, and I'm aiming for whole pounds, I need:\n\n\\[ 21 ounces \\mod 16 = 5 \\]\n\nThis means I have 5 ounces over one pound. So, to reach the next whole number of pounds, I need to add enough ounces to get from 21 to the nearest 32 ounces (2 pounds, because 16 times 2 is 32).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Additional Ounces Needed**\n\nHmm, let's calculate how many more ounces I need. \n\n21 ounces is 1 pound and 5 ounces. To make it 2 pounds, I need a total of 32 ounces (which is 16 times 2). The difference is:\n\n\\[ 32 \\text{ ounces} - 21 \\text{ ounces} = 11 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nSo, 11 ounces of white jelly beans would make the entire mixture weigh exactly 2 pounds.\n\n**Step 5: Verification**\n\nLet's verify this. If we add 11 ounces of white jelly beans, we'll have: \n\n\\[ 21 \\text{ ounces} + 11 \\text{ ounces} = 32 \\text{ ounces} \\]\n\nNow, dividing 32 by 16, we get exactly 2 pounds. This calculation confirms that adding 11 ounces of white jelly beans achieves the goal.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nAfter breaking it down step-by-step and checking along the way, I\u2019m confident in the solution. It's always a good practice to ensure calculations match logical expectations, and in this case, 11 ounces was the right amount to add. \n\nIt was a straightforward arithmetic problem that required careful consideration of basic unit conversion and modular arithmetic. \n\nSo, the answer is that Alexa must buy and add 11 ounces of white jelly beans to have exactly an integer number of pounds in her mixture.",

  "ground_truth": "Since 8+13=21 ounces and there are 16 ounces in a pound, the minimum number of ounces Alexa must add to have an integer number of pounds is $2\\cdot16-21=32-21=\\boxed{11}$."
