    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. It looks like we're dealing with finding where a line intersects the $xy$-plane, given its intersection points with the $yz$-plane and the $xz$-plane. This seems like it hinges on understanding the geometry of planes and lines in 3D space.\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Exploration\n\nFirst thoughts are always a rough canvas. Seeing two points of intersection provided \u2014 one on $yz$ and one on $xz$ \u2014 makes me think about line equations in 3D space. As soon as I see this, I recall that to find where the line intersects another plane, it's crucial to determine the line's parametric or vector equation.\n\nMy brain says this fits a common theme: lines and planes intersection can be approached by parametric equations or vector equations. \n\n- First intersection: $yz$-plane at $(0, -2, -5)$\n- Second intersection: $xz$-plane at $(3, 0, -1)$\n- Desired intersection: $xy$-plane, which is defined by $z = 0$.\n\nThere's a pattern in extracting the direction vector to use for the line equation, but wait, maybe I need to start by carefully understanding how to construct that line.\n\n### Establishing the Equation of the Line\n\n**Step 1: Determine Direction Vector**\n\nThe line passes through the points:\n- \\( P_1 = (0, -2, -5) \\)\n- \\( P_2 = (3, 0, -1) \\)\n\nThis reminds me of the strategy: the direction vector (denoted \\( \\vec{d} \\)) can be found by subtracting the coordinates of \\( P_1 \\) from \\( P_2 \\):\n\\[ \\vec{d} = P_2 - P_1 = (3 - 0, 0 - (-2), -1 - (-5)) = (3, 2, 4) \\]\n\nThis feels right so far. Okay, next step.\n\n**Step 2: Write Parametric Equations**\n\nWe can use a point and the direction vector to find parametric equations of the line. Using \\( P_1 \\) as the anchor point (could be \\( P_2 \\) as well, but start here), let's build the line equation:\n\\[ x = 0 + 3t = 3t \\]\n\\[ y = -2 + 2t \\]\n\\[ z = -5 + 4t \\]\n\nEach of these expressions represents the coordinates as the parameter \\( t \\) varies. \n\n**Reflection**: Taking a pause... Do these equations make sense for both points \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_2 \\)? Intuitively checking when \\( t = 0 \\),:\n- \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = -2 \\), and \\( z = -5 \\) (which matches \\( P_1 \\))\n\nAnd plugging in what should yield \\( P_2 \\) \u2014 that's \\( t = 1 \\):\n- \\( x = 3(1) = 3 \\)\n- \\( y = -2 + 2(1) = 0 \\)\n- \\( z = -5 + 4(1) = -1 \\) (which matches \\( P_2 \\))\n\nPhew, that fits. Let's proceed.\n\n### Finding Intersection with the $xy$-Plane\n\n**Step 3: Set z = 0**\n\nTo find where this line intersects the $xy$-plane, solve for when \\( z = 0 \\):\n\\[ z = -5 + 4t = 0 \\]\n\\[ 4t = 5 \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{5}{4} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for x and y at this t**\n\nNow substitute \\( t = \\frac{5}{4} \\) back into the parametric equations for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\n\\[ x = 3 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{15}{4} \\]\n\\[ y = -2 + 2 \\times \\frac{5}{4} = -2 + \\frac{10}{4} = -2 + \\frac{5}{2} = -\\frac{4}{2} + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\n**Check**: Cross-verification process.\nDoes this new point \\( (\\frac{15}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}, 0) \\) sound like a plausible output, considering the provided starting data?\n\nYes, setting up how \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) are computed based on my direction vector made sense! Also, packaging in the logic of equations through substitution flowed naturally.\n\nThus, the intersection point of the line with the $xy$-plane is \\( \\left(\\frac{15}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right) \\).\n\nReflecting back: this felt smooth, with plenty of checking and affirmations alongside logical derivations. It feels good to reach a solid conclusion.",
