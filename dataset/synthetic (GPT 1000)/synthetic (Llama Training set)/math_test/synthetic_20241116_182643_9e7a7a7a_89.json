    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. It's about finding ordered triples \\((x, y, z)\\) satisfying three equations. Whenever I see a problem with multiple variables and equations, I initially consider whether symmetry plays a role, and I'm also curious about substitutions or other systems-solving strategies.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- The equations are neither linear nor entirely polynomial of the same degree, which is interesting.\n- This looks like a problem that might have some neat symmetry or clever manipulation since the constraints are specifically three equations for three variables.\n- I notice symmetry can sometimes simplify such problems, or perhaps there's a particular substitution that clears things up.\n  \n#### Step 1: Understanding the Equations\n\nLet's jot down the equations again:\n\n1. \\( x + y - z = 0 \\)\n2. \\( xz - xy + yz = 27 \\)\n3. \\( xyz = 54 \\)\n\nThe first thing that strikes me is that equation (1) allows me to express one variable in terms of the others, namely \\( z = x + y \\).\n\n### Strategy 1: Substitution\n\nUsing \\( z = x + y \\) from equation (1), substitute \\( z \\) in the other equations.\n\n#### Substitute into the second equation:\n\n\\[ x(x + y) - xy + y(x + y) = 27 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ x^2 + xy - xy + y^2 + xy = 27 \\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 + xy = 27 \\]\n\nThis equation is looking more symmetric. Always good to reflect \u2013 checks with our substitution seem sound.\n\n#### Substituting into the third equation:\n\nFrom \\( z = x + y \\), \\( xyz = x \\cdot y \\cdot (x + y) = 54 \\).\n\n### Simplifying Conditions:\n\nNow, my thoughts: It's nice to have one variable fewer initially. Now we've reduced the problem to solving:\n\n1. \\( x^2 + y^2 + xy = 27 \\)\n2. \\( x \\cdot y \\cdot (x + y) = 54 \\)\n\nI feel we can possibly parameterize or try specific values since these seem pairable with symmetric equations and could simplify through potential integer solutions or simple re-adjustments. Especially, given that the problem looks designed to work out \"nicely.\"\n\n### Step 2: Explore Specific Values / Patterns\n\nGiven symmetrical forms, I think about checking for simple integer or symmetrical solutions:\n\nLet's assume some small positive integers for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that might simplify the problem.\n\nAssumption: Try \\( x = y \\)\n\n- Substitute \\( x = y \\) into the simplified equations:\n\n\\[ x^2 + x^2 + x^2 = 27 \\]\n\\[ 3x^2 = 27 \\]\n\\[ x^2 = 9 \\]\n\\[ x = \\pm 3 \\]\n\nAt this point, let\u2019s pause to reflect: interesting case. It shows \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) taking potentially symmetric values with nice results. Check if this value satisfies the third equation:\n\nIf \\( x = y = 3 \\), then:\n\\[ z = x + y = 6 \\]\n\\[\nxyz = 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6 = 54 \n\\]\n\nThis indeed checks out! Awesome, we have one viable solution \\((3, 3, 6)\\).\n\n### Step 3: Solving for General Cases\n\nNow, consider alternatives: \n\n- What if \\(x = -y\\)? Given the constraint forms, negative solutions might counterbalance to put products/ squares correctly.\n\nExplore \\( z = x+y \\) allowing say alternations \\((3, -3, 0)\\), but realize quickly:\n\\[ xyz = 3 \\cdot (-3) \\cdot 0 = 0 \\neq 54. \\]\n\n### Step 4: Verify Complete\n\nReflecting here, given constraints typically allow for such singular solutions due to symmetry/balance. Since symmetrical implies multiple outcomes, trying different pairings leads athletic quick-checks, showing no other real solutions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI\u2019ve verified that initially substituting and manipulating key symmetries simplifies the scenario. Mathemathematically concise, only one true solution manifests. Hence:\nThe unique ordered triple \\((x, y, z)\\) that fits all the criteria is \\((3, 3, 6)\\).\n\nEnsure thoroughness, revisiting equations, past consideration reflects potential checking multiple times ensured no others arise. Wrapping up!\n\nAhh, I see where I went astray. Let's re-evaluate the problem and see if we can uncover additional solutions. My previous exploration only yielded one solution, which was due to an oversight. Let's approach this afresh, integrating a new strategy inspired by the feedback.\n\n### Revisiting the System of Equations\n\nGiven the equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y - z = 0 \\)\n2. \\( xz - xy + yz = 27 \\)\n3. \\( xyz = 54 \\)\n\nAs before, let's start with the substitution \\( z = x + y \\). Substituting into the remaining equations:\n\n- Transform the second equation: \n\n  \\[\n  x(x + y) - xy + y(x + y) = 27 \n  \\]\n\n  Simplify to:\n\n  \\[\n  x^2 + y^2 + xy = 27\n  \\]\n\n- Transform the third equation:\n\n  \\[\n  x \\cdot y \\cdot (x + y) = 54\n  \\]\n\nNow, let's use a different technique to explore the roots of the system: treating them as a polynomial. We'll introduce new variables and explore Vieta's formulas.\n\n### Exploring Using Polynomial Roots\n\nLet's set \\(a = x\\), \\(b = y\\), and \\(c = -z\\). This gives us:\n\n- \\( a + b + c = 0 \\)\n- \\( ab + ac + bc = -27 \\)\n- \\( abc = -54 \\)\n\nThese equations suggest that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are roots of a cubic polynomial. By Vieta's formulas, our polynomial is:\n\n\\[\nt^3 - 27t + 54 = 0\n\\]\n\nLet's factor this polynomial and find its roots. Trying small integer roots using the Rational Root Theorem or simply checking manually, we find:\n\n\\[\n(t - 3)^2 (t + 6) = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the roots are \\(3, 3, -6\\).\n\n### Formulating Ordered Triples\n\nGiven these roots, the possible values for \\((a, b, c)\\) are permutations of \\((3, 3, -6)\\). We relate these back to \\((x, y, z)\\):\n\n- If \\(a = x = 3\\), \\(b = y = 3\\), \\(c = -z = -6\\), then \\(z = 6\\), resulting in the triple \\((3, 3, 6)\\).\n\n- Another permutation: if \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = -6\\), \\(c = 3\\), then \\(x = 3\\), \\(y = -6\\), \\(z = -3\\), resulting in the triple \\((3, -6, -3)\\).\n\n- Lastly, if \\(a = -6\\), \\(b = 3\\), \\(c = 3\\), then \\(x = -6\\), \\(y = 3\\), \\(z = -3\\), resulting in the triple \\((-6, 3, -3)\\).\n\n### Conclusion and Reflection\n\nBy reassessing the relationships between variables and utilizing the polynomial strategy, I've found multiple valid solutions in the form of ordered triples. The solutions that satisfy all the given equations are \\((3, 3, 6)\\), \\((3, -6, -3)\\), and \\((-6, 3, -3)\\). Hence, there are indeed three ordered triples: \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
