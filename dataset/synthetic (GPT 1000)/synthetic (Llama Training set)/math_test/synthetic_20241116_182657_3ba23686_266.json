    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We want to find the largest integer \\( x \\) such that the expression \\(\\sqrt{3620 + 322x - 4x^2}\\) is a real number. The key point here is realizing that in order for the square root to be real, the expression inside must be non-negative. So, our task is to ensure that:\n\n\\[ 3620 + 322x - 4x^2 \\geq 0. \\]\n\nFirst thoughts:\n\n1. **Quadratic Expression**: This is structured like a quadratic inequality: \\( -4x^2 + 322x + 3620 \\geq 0 \\). I need to find the values of \\( x \\) for which this inequality holds. It\u2019s a downward-opening parabola (since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\), which is \\(-4\\), is negative), so it will be positive between its roots.\n\n2. **Finding the Roots**: Let's find the roots of the corresponding equation \\( -4x^2 + 322x + 3620 = 0 \\). This seems like the natural place to start.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the Quadratic Equation\nThe quadratic equation derived from the expression is:\n\\[ -4x^2 + 322x + 3620 = 0. \\]\n\n### Step 2: Use the Quadratic Formula\nThe quadratic formula \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) will give us the roots of this equation. Here, \\( a = -4 \\), \\( b = 322 \\), and \\( c = 3620 \\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = 322^2 - 4(-4)(3620). \\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n1. Compute \\( 322^2 \\): \n   \\[ 322^2 = 103684. \\]\n\n2. Compute \\( 4 \\times 4 \\times 3620 \\):\n   \\[ 4 \\times 3620 = 14480, \\]\n   \\[ 4 \\times 14480 = 57920. \\]\n\n3. Now calculate the discriminant:\n   \\[ 103684 + 57920 = 161604. \\]\n\nHmm, this is reassuringly large and positive, suggesting two real roots as expected.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Roots\nNow, substitute back into the quadratic formula:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-322 \\pm \\sqrt{161604}}{-8}. \\]\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{161604} = 402. \\] (This step might take a calculator but approximating or verifying this isn\u2019t far off)\n\nSo, we substitute back:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-322 \\pm 402}{-8}. \\]\n\nLet's find both roots:\n\n1. \\( x_1 = \\frac{-322 + 402}{-8} = \\frac{80}{-8} = -10. \\)\n\n2. \\( x_2 = \\frac{-322 - 402}{-8} = \\frac{-724}{-8} = 90.5. \\]\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Valid Range of \\( x \\)\nSince the parabola opens downwards, the expression will be non-negative between the roots. So:\n\n\\[ -10 \\leq x \\leq 90.5. \\]\n\nSince we are asked to find the largest integer \\( x \\), the largest integer in this interval is \\( 90 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe largest integer \\( x \\) such that \\(\\sqrt{3620 + 322x - 4x^2}\\) is real is \\( x = 90 \\).\n\nReflecting back, this solution seems correct due to the verification steps of root calculations and logical reasoning about the inequality and parabola behavior. I'm confident this is the right approach, as it aligns perfectly with the quadratic nature of the expression and ensures real values for the square root.",
