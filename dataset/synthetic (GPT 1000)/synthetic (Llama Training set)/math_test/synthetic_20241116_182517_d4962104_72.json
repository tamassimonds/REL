    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into solving this problem: finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 14, 20, and 35. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\nThis sounds like a problem I've tackled before using prime factorization. But there's also the method of listing multiples...Hmm. That could get really messy with these numbers - they seem big. So maybe the prime factorization method is the best here. I should confirm which approach will be more efficient given these specific numbers.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n1. **Prime Factorization Approach:**\n   - This involves breaking each number down into its prime factors and then taking the highest power of each prime number to compute the LCM. It seems logical because it helps me organize my thoughts better.\n   \n2. **Listing Multiples Approach:**\n   - Listing multiples of each number and finding the smallest common one could work, but might quickly get cumbersome due to potentially large values.\n\n**Starting the Prime Factorization Approach:**\nLet's see how these numbers break down:\n\n- **14:** This is \\(2 \\times 7\\). Pretty straightforward.\n- **20:** This factors to \\(2^2 \\times 5\\). \n- **35:** This breaks down to \\(5 \\times 7\\).\n\n**Reflection Here:**\nAlright, I have the prime factors now. Let me have them side by side for clarity:\n- \\(14 = 2 \\times 7\\)\n- \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5\\)\n- \\(35 = 5 \\times 7\\)\n\n**Combining for LCM:**\nTo find the LCM, I should take the highest power of all primes that appear. This means I need:\n- The highest power of 2: That\u2019s \\(2^2\\) from 20.\n- The highest power of 5: That\u2019s \\(5\\) since it appears in both 20 and 35.\n- The highest power of 7: That\u2019s \\(7\\) since it appears in both 14 and 35.\n\nCalculate \\(\\text{LCM} = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 7\\).\n\n\\(2^2\\) is \\(4\\), and multiplying through:\n\\[ \n4 \\times 5 = 20\n\\]\n\\[ \n20 \\times 7 = 140\n\\]\n\nMy tentative LCM is 140. Let me check this against my intuition\u2014is this reasonable?\n\n**Check and Reflection:**\nLet\u2019s quickly verify:\n- 140 divided by 14: \\(140 \\div 14 = 10\\), a whole number. Good.\n- 140 divided by 20: \\(140 \\div 20 = 7\\), a whole number. Yes, that works.\n- 140 divided by 35: \\(140 \\div 35 = 4\\), again whole. All fit perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI think this approach was effective, and the calculations have borne it out correctly\u2014no missteps I can see. The least common multiple of 14, 20, and 35 is indeed 140. This even aligns with what I'd expect after reviewing the checks, so I\u2019m feeling confident.\n\nAlright, based on everything, the least common multiple of 14, 20, and 35 is **140**.",

  "ground_truth": "The prime factorizations of the integers are $2\\cdot7$, $2^2\\cdot5$, and $5\\cdot7$. In the prime factorizations, the highest powers of distinct factors are $2^2$, $5$, and $7$, so the least common multiple is $2^2\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{140}$."
