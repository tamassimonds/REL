    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think it through step-by-step. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nOkay, so the problem involves changing the dimensions of a cylindrical jar while keeping its volume constant. Right off the bat, this reminds me of the formula for the volume of a cylinder: \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height. \n\nI can see that increasing the diameter of the jar would affect the radius, and since the radius is related to the diameter by \\( r = \\frac{d}{2} \\), increasing the diameter by 25% affects the radius too. The volume needs to remain constant even though these dimensions are being changed.\n\n### Brainstorming Possible Approaches\n\n1. **Direct Application of Volume Formula:** I could set up equations for the initial and altered dimensions and solve for the height.\n2. **Proportional Reasoning:** Think about how volume is proportional to both the square of the radius and the height.\n3. **Percentage Change Approach:** Consider how the 25% increase changes the radius and how to balance this with a change in height to keep the volume constant.\n\n### Deciding on a Strategy\n\nI will first use the direct application of the volume formula as it seems straightforward and aligns with the mathematical principles I'm reminded of.\n\n### Setting up the Problem\n\nLet's define some variables:\n- Initial diameter: \\( d \\)\n- Initial radius: \\( r = \\frac{d}{2} \\)\n- Initial height: \\( h \\)\n\nThe volume of the initial jar can be expressed as:\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h = \\pi \\left( \\frac{d}{2} \\right)^2 h \\]\n\nAfter the diameter is increased by 25%, the new diameter is:\n\\[ d' = 1.25d \\]\n\nSo, the new radius \\( r' \\) is:\n\\[ r' = \\frac{d'}{2} = \\frac{1.25d}{2} = 0.625d \\]\n\nWe need the volume to remain constant:\n\\[ V' = V \\]\n\nSubstituting the new radius into the volume formula and equaling it to the original volume gives us:\n\\[ \\pi (0.625d)^2 h' = \\pi \\left( \\frac{d}{2} \\right)^2 h \\]\n\nCancel the common terms and simplify:\n\\[ (0.625)^2 d^2 h' = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 d^2 h \\]\n\n\\[ 0.390625 h' = 0.25 h \\]\n\n### Solving for the New Height\n\nLet's solve for \\( h' \\):\n\\[ h' = \\frac{0.25}{0.390625} h \\]\n\nEvaluating the fraction:\n\\[ h' = \\frac{0.25}{0.390625} h \\approx 0.64 \\times h \\]\n\n### Calculating Percent Decrease\n\nTo find out by what percent the height must be decreased:\n\\[ \\text{Percent decrease} = \\left( 1 - 0.64 \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percent decrease} = 0.36 \\times 100\\% = 36\\% \\]\n\n### Reflection and Verification\n\nLet's check if this solution makes sense:\n- By increasing the diameter, the radius squared term in the volume formula increases, and for the volume to stay constant, the compensating factor would require a decrease in height.\n- The decrease in height seems reasonable since an increase in radius squared (by 25% leading to a 56.25% increase in the area factor) would need a significant decrease in height to balance.\n\nEverything checks out logically and mathematically. The height must be decreased by approximately 36% to keep the volume constant when the diameter is increased by 25%.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $r, h,$ and $V$, respectively, be the radius, height, and volume of the jar that is currently being used. The new jar will have a radius of $1.25r$ and volume $V$. Let $H$ be the height of the new jar. Then \\[\n\\pi r^{2} h = V = \\pi (1.25r)^{2} H,\\] so \\[\n\\frac{H}{h}=\\frac{1}{(1.25)^{2}}= 0.64.\n\\] Thus $H$ is $64\\%$ of $h$, so the height must be reduced by $(100 - 64)\\% = \\boxed{36} \\%$."
