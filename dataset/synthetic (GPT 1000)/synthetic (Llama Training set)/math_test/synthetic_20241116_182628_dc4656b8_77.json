    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The equation we're working with is:\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\n\\]\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see this equation, it reminds me of problems involving reciprocals and fractions since there are negative exponents involved. My first thought is to try to simplify the expression involving \\(8^{-1}\\) and \\(4^{-1}\\).\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Fraction\n\n**Thought Process:** Negative exponents can be tricky, but they essentially represent reciprocals. \n\n- \\(8^{-1}\\) is the reciprocal of 8, which is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n- \\(4^{-1}\\) is the reciprocal of 4, which is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nThe expression inside the fraction can thus be rewritten using these:\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \\dfrac{\\frac{1}{8}}{\\frac{1}{4}}\n\\]\n\n**Next steps:** Simplifying the division of two fractions.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Division\n\n**Thought Process:** Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{\\frac{1}{8}}{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{4}{1} = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** This looks reasonable since multiplying and simplifying fractions is straightforward. Moving on to the next part!\n\n### Step 3: Substitute Back and Solve for \\(a\\)\n\n**Thought Process:** Now substitute back into the original expression we simplified:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1\n\\]\n\nI need to isolate \\(a^{-1}\\).\n\n\\[\n-a^{-1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Next steps:** Evaluate the right side.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Right Side\n\n**Thought Process:** \n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\n-a^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Both sides make sense, so I can continue solving for \\(a\\).\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\(a^{-1} \\)\n\n**Thought Process:** \n\nMultiply both sides by \\(-1\\) to isolate \\(a^{-1}\\).\n\n\\[\na^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow consider what \\(a\\) should be:\n\n**Find \\(a\\):** Since \\(a^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(a\\) must be the reciprocal of this expression.\n\n\\[\na = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{-1} = -2\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Quickly verify the outcome makes sense.\n\n### Verification\n\n**Entire equation:** Plug back the value of \\(a\\) to check if everything holds:\n\n- \\(a^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\) implies \\(a = -2\\).\n\n- Replace \\(a\\) by \\(-2\\) (original equation reconstruction check):\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} - (-2)^{-1} = 1\n  \\]\n\n  Since \\((-2)^{-1}\\) is indeed \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\),\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n  \\]\n\nThe equation is satisfied, confirming that my solution works.\n\n### Reflection\n\nThe solution \\(a = -2\\) checks out nicely when I verified it with the original equation. Handling the negative exponents carefully really helped streamline the process. Reciprocals can initially be confusing, but they are very useful when simplified thoughtfully.\n\nEvery step felt solid on cross-checking, and no unexpected results popped up, so the way through was indeed correct!\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\[ \na = -2 \n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "First, we simplify the left side, using the exponent rule $x^{-1} = \\frac1x$.  We have  \\[\n\\frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = \\frac{1/8}{1/4} - \\frac1a = \\frac18\\cdot \\frac41 -\\frac{1}{a}= \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac1a,\n\\] so we can write the original equation as $\\frac12 - \\frac1a = 1$.  Subtracting $\\frac12$ from both sides gives $-\\frac1a = \\frac12$, and taking the reciprocal of both sides gives $-a = 2$.  Therefore, we have $a = \\boxed{-2}$."
