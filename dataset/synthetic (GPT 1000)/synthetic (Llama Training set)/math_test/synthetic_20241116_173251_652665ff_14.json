  "problem": "A map of the town that Annie and Barbara live in can be represented by the Cartesian plane. Annie is located at $(3,5)$ and Barbara says she is located at $(-6,2)$. They agree to meet the midpoint of their current locations. However, it turns out that Barbara read the map wrong, and she is actually at $(-10,4)$. What is the positive difference in the $x$-coordinates of where they agreed to meet and where they should actually meet?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, it looks like a standard midpoint problem in geometry with a twist because of the incorrect information. Here we go:\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n1. Okay, this is a midpoint problem. We need to find the midpoint of two coordinates on a Cartesian plane. \n2. The twist here is that there are two different scenarios - one based on the incorrect location and one on the correct location.\n3. Ultimately, we're asked to find the positive difference in the x-coordinates of these two midpoints.\n\n**Strategy Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Initial Midpoint Calculation:** Find the midpoint using Annie's coordinates (3,5) and the initially assumed coordinates for Barbara (-6,2).\n   \n2. **Correct Midpoint Calculation:** Find the midpoint using Annie's coordinates (3,5) and Barbara's actual coordinates (-10,4).\n\n3. **Difference in Midpoints:** Calculate the positive difference between the x-coordinates of these two midpoints.\n\n4. Reflect if there could be simpler or alternate ways to double-check or verify results.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculations:**\n\n**Step 1: Midpoint with Incorrect Coordinates**\n- Formula for the midpoint is: \\[ \\text{Midpoint} = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right) \\]\n- For Annie (3,5) and assumed Barbara (-6,2):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Midpoint} = \\left( \\frac{3 + (-6)}{2}, \\frac{5 + 2}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{-3}{2}, \\frac{7}{2} \\right)\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:** \n- The x-coordinate calculation: 3 + (-6) = -3, and -3/2 is -1.5.\n- The y-coordinate becomes 7/2, which simplifies to 3.5. So far, seems right.\n\n**Step 2: Midpoint with Correct Coordinates**\n- For Annie (3,5) and real Barbara (-10,4):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Midpoint} = \\left( \\frac{3 + (-10)}{2}, \\frac{5 + 4}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{-7}{2}, \\frac{9}{2} \\right)\n  \\]\n  \n**Deeper Reflection:**\n- Double-checking: For the x-coordinate, 3 + (-10) = -7, which simplifies to -3.5.\n- Y-coordinates are consistent with calculation: 9/2 = 4.5. This checks out.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Positive Difference in X-Coordinates**\n\n- Difference in x-coordinates: \\(|-1.5 - (-3.5)|\\).\n- Calculating: -1.5 - (-3.5) = -1.5 + 3.5 = 2.\n\n**Reflect on the Final Step:**\n- Just ensure the absolute value was correctly interpreted; but yes, this is right: 2 is the difference. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The positive difference in the x-coordinates of where they agreed to meet and where they should actually meet is \\(2\\).\n\nGreat! This was quite methodical and straightforward upon breaking down the steps. Each calculation aligns with the premise of midpoint formula logic, ensuring accurate results through rechecks.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the problem only asks for the difference in the $x$-coordinates, we can ignore the $y$-coordinates.\nThey originally agreed to meet at the midpoint of $(3,5)$ and $(-6,2)$, so the $x$-coordinate of the planned location is $\\frac{3+(-6)}{2}=-\\frac{3}{2}$.\nThe correct meeting location should be at the midpoint of $(3,5)$ and $(-10,4)$, so the $x$-coordinate should be at $\\frac{3+(-10)}{2}=-\\frac{7}{2}$. The positive difference is $-\\frac{3}{2}-(-\\frac{7}{2})=\\boxed{2}$.\nAlternatively, notice that a 4-unit change in the $x$-coordinate of Barbara's location resulted in a 2-unit change in the midpoint since the 4 gets divided by 2. $\\frac{3+(-10)}{2}=\\frac{3+(-6)}{2}+\\frac{-4}{2}=-\\frac{3}{2}-\\boxed{2}$."
