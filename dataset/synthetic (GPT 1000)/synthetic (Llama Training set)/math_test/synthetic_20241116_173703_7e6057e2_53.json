    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- I need to find the smallest possible average of four distinct positive even integers. \n- My initial thoughts on this are that smaller numbers typically give smaller averages.\n- I know positive even integers start from 2, so maybe starting there could help.\n\nBrainstorming:\n- The problem is about averages, which means I need to sum the integers and divide by 4. \n- Since integers must be distinct, I can't repeat any number, so using consecutive even numbers might be a straightforward approach. \n- Let\u2019s list out the first few even integers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc. \n- Hmm, I think using the smallest even numbers might be key here to get the lowest average.\n\nTrying an Approach:\n- Okay, let's try using the smallest four even numbers: 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n- Sum: \\( 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20 \\).\n- Average: \\( 20 \\div 4 = 5 \\).\n\nChecking Work:\n- Is this the smallest average possible? What if I check smaller combinations?\n- Let\u2019s see if starting with smaller numbers leads to a problem. Using numbers smaller than 2 isn't possible in the realm of positive integers.\n- If I rethink combinations like \\(4, 6, 8, 10\\), the average is \\(7\\), which is larger than 5.\n  \nDeeper Reflection:\n- It seems like using the smallest distinct integers here gives us the best (smallest) result.\n- Let's rethink: could a different set give a better (lower) average without violating the distinct condition? \n\nRandom Insights:\n- No, using any set of larger numbers would only increase the sum and thus the average.\n- 2 is the smallest positive even integer, so it must be in our set for the smallest average.\n- If each number is increased, the sum increases, hence the average will increase too.\n\nConclusion:\n- The hypothesis and calculation led us to this solution logically: the numbers \\(2, 4, 6, 8\\) yield the smallest possible average of 5 for four distinct positive even integers.\n  \nFinal check:\n- Can\u2019t tweak the numbers to get a lower average while maintaining distinctness and the requirement for them to be even.\n- Confirmed: smaller numbers as calculated provide the lowest average with distinct numbers. The solution holds.",

  "ground_truth": "The smallest average will occur when the numbers are as small as possible.  The four smallest distinct positive even integers are 2, 4, 6, and 8 and their average is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\n$\\textbf{Note:}$ These numbers form an arithmetic sequence.  The average of the numbers in any arithmetic sequence is the average of the first and last terms."
