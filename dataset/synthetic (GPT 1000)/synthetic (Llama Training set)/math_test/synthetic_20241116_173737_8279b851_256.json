    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem. I'm really intrigued by this; it involves finding the minimum distance from the origin to a point on a curve, which usually suggests some geometry or calculus might be involved.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- The problem asks for the smallest distance between the origin \\((0,0)\\) and a point on the parabola given by \\(y = x^2 - 5\\).\n- My first instinct is that this could involve using a distance formula, setting up an equation, and maybe some calculus.\n- But dealing with parabolas, I often remember that problems like this sometimes have neat geometric insights that might help simplify the math.\n\n### Brainstorming:\n- **Distance Formula**: The distance \\(D\\) between the origin and a point \\((x, y)\\) is given by \\(D(x, y) = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\).\n- Substituting \\(y = x^2 - 5\\) into the distance formula, \\(D\\) becomes: \n  \\[ D(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 + (x^2 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + (x^4 - 10x^2 + 25)} \\]\n  \\[ D(x) = \\sqrt{x^4 - 9x^2 + 25} \\]\n- I need to minimize \\(D(x)\\). My brain is reminding me of optimization problems.\n\n### Reflecting on the Approach:\n- Minimizing the square of the distance \\(D(x)^2 = x^4 - 9x^2 + 25\\) could simplify differentiation since the square root is removed. \n\n### Calculus Approach:\n1. Define: \n   \\[ f(x) = x^4 - 9x^2 + 25 \\]\n2. Differentiate to find critical points: \n   \\[ f'(x) = 4x^3 - 18x \\]\n3. Set the derivative to zero:\n   \\[ 4x^3 - 18x = 0 \\]\n   \\[ 2x(2x^2 - 9) = 0 \\]\n   So \\(x = 0\\) or \\(2x^2 - 9 = 0\\).\n4. Solve for \\(x\\):\n   - \\( x = 0 \\) \n   - \\( 2x^2 = 9 \\) \n   - \\( x^2 = \\frac{9}{2} \\) \n   - \\( x = \\pm \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\pm \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\)\n\n### Evaluating Critical Points:\n- Plug these \\(x\\) values back into \\(f(x)\\):\n\n  \\- **When \\(x = 0\\):** \n  \\[ f(0) = 0^4 - 9 \\cdot 0^2 + 25 = 25 \\]\n\n  \\- **When \\(x = \\pm \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\):**\n  \\[ f\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^2 - 9\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right) + 25 \\]\n  \\[ = \\frac{81}{4} - \\frac{81}{2} + 25 \\]\n  \\[ = \\frac{81}{4} - \\frac{162}{4} + \\frac{100}{4} = \\frac{19}{4} \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The minimum value of \\(f(x)\\) is 19/4, corresponding to the point \\(x = \\pm \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n- The actual minimum distance \\(D\\) is \\(\\sqrt{19/4} = \\sqrt{19}/2\\).\n\nThus, in \\(\\sqrt{a}/b\\) form, \\(a = 19\\) and \\(b = 2\\). Therefore, the answer to the problem is:\n\\[ a + b = 19 + 2 = 21 \\]\n\nWow! That's quite satisfying. Double-checking shows the calculations are consistent with the steps and logic. Everything checks out.",

  "ground_truth": "By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\\pm 3/\\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\\sqrt{25-\\frac{81}{4}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\\boxed{21}$."
