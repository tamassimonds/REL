    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The main task is to calculate the probability that the two 'E's in the word 'SIXTEEN' are not next to each other.\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- When I see this problem, I remember similar problems about arranging letters or objects without them being in certain positions. It reminds me of permutation and combination problems.\n- At first glance, I'm unsure whether to use combinatorics or another approach like probability directly, but let's explore the possibilities.\n\nInitial Exploration:\n1. **Total Arrangements without Restrictions**:\n   - The word 'SIXTEEN' has 7 letters where the letter 'E' repeats twice.\n   - The formula to calculate the permutations of n items where there are repeated items is \\( \\frac{n!}{k_1! \\times k_2! \\times \\ldots} \\).\n   - Here, \\( n = 7 \\) and the arrangement of 'E's gives: \\(\\frac{7!}{2!} \\).\n\n   Let's calculate that: \n   - \\( 7! = 5040 \\).\n   - \\( 2! = 2 \\).\n   - So, \\( \\frac{5040}{2} = 2520 \\) total arrangements.\n\n2. **Arrangements with the Two E's Together**:\n   - To explore this, I consider the two 'E's as a single \"block\" or \"super letter\".\n   - This makes the arrangement of 6 distinct items: 'S', 'I', 'X', 'T', 'EE', 'N'.\n   - Now, calculate permutations for these 6 items: \\( 6! \\).\n\n   Let's calculate that:\n   - \\( 6! = 720 \\).\n\n3. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - Probability is essentially the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.\n   - If there are 720 ways for the two 'E's to be together, then the number of ways they are not together is \\( 2520 - 720 \\).\n\n   Let's perform that calculation:\n   - \\( 2520 - 720 = 1800 \\).\n\n   - So, the probability is \\( \\frac{1800}{2520} \\).\n\n   This simplifies to:\n   - Divide both numerator and denominator by 180: \n   - \\( \\frac{1800 \\div 180}{2520 \\div 180} = \\frac{10}{14} = \\frac{5}{7} \\).\n\nCheck My Work:\n- My initial number of total arrangements seems reasonable given the structure of the word.\n- I reflected on whether calculating the \"block\" of 'E's makes sense. It does since grouping helps manage repeated elements in permutations.\n- Probability calculation checks out since subtracting the unfavorable case from the total gives direct favorable cases.\n\nAha Moment:\n- Recognizing that the best way to approach the problem was to use combinations and permutations\u2014not initially obvious\u2014and the block method for the two 'E's was the key insight here.\n\nConclusion:\n- The probability that the two 'E's in 'SIXTEEN' are not next to each other is \\( \\frac{5}{7} \\).\n\nI'm reasonably confident in this result after checking steps and considering different methods. If anything seems incorrect in a deeper reflection, I'd reassess initial permutation calculations or consider an alternative configuration method.",

  "ground_truth": "The best way to do this is to find the probability that the two E's are next to each other.  There are $\\dfrac{7!}{2}$ arrangements of the word SIXTEEN.  If we want to find the number of arrangements such that the E's are next to each other, we find the number of arrangements of the six-letter word SIXT(EE)N (where we treat the two E's as a block), which is $6!$.  So the probability that an arrangement of the word SIXTEEN has the two E's next to each other is $\\dfrac{6!}{\\frac{7!}{2}} = \\dfrac{2}{7}$.  So the probability that the two E's aren't next to each other is $1 - \\dfrac{2}{7} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{7}}$."
