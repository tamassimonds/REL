    "working_out": "## Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, I've got a problem involving a hyperbola equation. The equation given is \\(x^2 - 10x = 4y^2 - 5\\). I need to find the coordinates of one of the foci. The question is somewhat reminiscent of problems I've seen before, usually involving rewriting the equation to a more standard form. \n\n**The main task:** Rewrite this equation into the standard form of a hyperbola, and then find the foci.\n\n## Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Complete the Square:**\n\n   My instinct here is to start with completing the square, particularly in the x-term, since that could help rewrite the equation into a more recognizable form. \n\n   \\[ x^2 - 10x \\] suggests it can be completed by adding and subtracting 25 (because \\((10/2)^2 = 25\\)):\n\n   \\[ x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \\]\n\n   Cool, so rewrite the equation:\n\n   \\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 = 4y^2 - 5 \\]\n\n   That feels right. Now simplify:\n\n   \\[ (x - 5)^2 - 4y^2 = 20 \\]\n\n2. **Rewrite in Standard Hyperbola Form:**\n\n   The standard form of a hyperbola is typically \\(\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1\\).\n\n   To get my equation into this form, divide everything by 20:\n\n   \\[ \\frac{(x - 5)^2}{20} - \\frac{4y^2}{20} = 1 \\]\n\n   Simplifying, I get:\n\n   \\[ \\frac{(x - 5)^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{5} = 1 \\]\n\n3. **Identify the Hyperbola Characteristics:**\n\n   Here's where my brain says, \"Okay, this is starting to look familiar.\" I\u2019ve got a hyperbola centered at \\((h, k) = (5, 0)\\).\n\n   From \\(\\frac{(x - 5)^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{5} = 1\\), note that:\n   \n   - \\(a^2 = 20\\), so \\(a = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}\\).\n   - \\(b^2 = 5\\), so \\(b = \\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Foci:**\n\n   The formula for the distance between the center and the foci of a hyperbola \\(x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 = 1\\) is \\(c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).\n\n   So calculate:\n\n   \\[\n   c = \\sqrt{20 + 5} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n   \\]\n\n   This means the foci are located at \\((h \\pm c, k)\\).\n\n   Since \\((h, k) = (5, 0)\\), the foci would be:\n\n   \\[\n   (5 \\pm 5, 0) = (10, 0) \\text{ and } (0, 0)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Solution:**\n\n   Since I'm supposed to provide only one focus, I'll choose \\((10, 0)\\).\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe coordinates of one of the foci of the hyperbola equation \\(x^2 - 10x = 4y^2 - 5\\) are \\((10, 0)\\).\n\nReflecting on this, it feels good to have completed this step-by-step with both intuition and calculation checks along the way. Each step linked logically to the next, leveraging algebraic manipulation and standard hyperbola properties to lead me to the endpoint.",

  "ground_truth": "To find the standard form for the equation of the hyperbola, we move all the terms to one side and then complete the square in both variables: \\[\\begin{aligned} x^2 - 10x - 4y^2 + 5  &= 0 \\\\ (x^2-10x+25) - 4y^2 + 5 &= 25 \\\\ (x-5)^2 - 4y^2 &= 20 \\\\ \\frac{(x-5)^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{5} &= 1. \\end{aligned}\\]This fits the standard form of the hyperbola \\[\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1,\\]where $a=2\\sqrt{5},$ $b=\\sqrt{5},$ $h=5,$ and $k=0.$ Thus, the center of the hyperbola is the point $(h,k)=(5,0).$ Because the $x^2$ coefficient is positive and the $y^2$ coefficient is negative, the foci are horizontally aligned with the center of the hyperbola. We have \\[c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{20+5} = 5,\\]which is the distance from the center of the hyperbola to each focus. Therefore, the two foci of the hyperbola are $(5 \\pm 5, 0),$ which gives two points: $\\boxed{(10, 0)}$ and $\\boxed{(0,0)}.$ (Either point is an acceptable answer.)[asy]\nvoid axes(real x0, real x1, real y0, real y1)\n{\n\tdraw((x0,0)--(x1,0),EndArrow);\n    draw((0,y0)--(0,y1),EndArrow);\n    label(\"$x$\",(x1,0),E);\n    label(\"$y$\",(0,y1),N);\n    for (int i=floor(x0)+1; i<x1; ++i)\n    \tdraw((i,.1)--(i,-.1));\n    for (int i=floor(y0)+1; i<y1; ++i)\n    \tdraw((.1,i)--(-.1,i));\n}\npath[] yh(real a, real b, real h, real k, real x0, real x1, bool upper=true, bool lower=true, pen color=black)\n{\n\treal f(real x) { return k + a / b * sqrt(b^2 + (x-h)^2); }\n    real g(real x) { return k - a / b * sqrt(b^2 + (x-h)^2); }\n    if (upper) { draw(graph(f, x0, x1),color,  Arrows); }\n    if (lower) { draw(graph(g, x0, x1),color,  Arrows); }\n    path [] arr = {graph(f, x0, x1), graph(g, x0, x1)};\n    return arr;\n}\nvoid xh(real a, real b, real h, real k, real y0, real y1, bool right=true, bool left=true, pen color=black)\n{\n\tpath [] arr = yh(a, b, k, h, y0, y1, false, false);\n    if (right) draw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*arr[0],color,  Arrows);\n    if (left) draw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*arr[1],color,  Arrows);\n}\nvoid e(real a, real b, real h, real k)\n{\n\tdraw(shift((h,k))*scale(a,b)*unitcircle);\n}\nsize(8cm);\naxes(-6,15, -5, 5);\nxh(2*sqrt(5),sqrt(5),5,0,-4,4);\ndot((5,0)^^(10,0)^^(0,0));\n[/asy]"
