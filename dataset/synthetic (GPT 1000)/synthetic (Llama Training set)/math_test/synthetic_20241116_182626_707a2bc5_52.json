    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem. We're given:\n\n\\[ x = -1 \\]\n\nAnd asked to find:\n\n\\[ x + x^2 + x^3 + \\cdots + x^{2010} + x^{2011} \\]\n\nThis looks like a geometric series, but there's a twist because of the alternating sign of \\(x\\). Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Series\nThe series is:\n\n\\[ (-1) + (-1)^2 + (-1)^3 + \\cdots + (-1)^{2010} + (-1)^{2011} \\]\n\nNotice that when we raise \\(-1\\) to an odd power, we get \\(-1\\), and to an even power, we get \\(1\\).\n\n#### First Thought:\nThis might oscillate between -1 and 1. Is there a pattern based on exponents being odd or even? Let's explore it.\n\n### Step 2: Recognize the Pattern\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\n(-1) &= -1, \\\\\n(-1)^2 &= 1, \\\\\n(-1)^3 &= -1, \\\\\n(-1)^4 &= 1, \\\\\n\\end{align*} \\]\n\nThe series alternates between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\):\n\n- Odd exponents (like 1, 3, 5, ...): the term is \\(-1\\)\n- Even exponents (like 2, 4, 6, ...): the term is \\(1\\)\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Problem\nCount the number of odd and even indices from 1 to 2011. \n\n1. Total terms = 2011 terms.\n\n2. Odd indices: Count of odd numbers from 1 to 2011:\n   - First odd number: 1\n   - Last odd number: 2011\n   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.\n   - Number of odd terms = \\(\\frac{2011 - 1}{2} + 1 = 1006\\)\n\n3. Even indices: Total terms - Odd terms = 2011 - 1006 = 1005\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total\nUsing the pattern, the sum is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sum of odd-index terms} = 1006 \\times (-1) = -1006 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Sum of even-index terms} = 1005 \\times 1 = 1005 \\]\n\n#### Putting it together:\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\n\\text{Total Sum} &= \\text{Sum of odd-index terms} + \\text{Sum of even-index terms} \\\\\n&= -1006 + 1005 \\\\\n&= -1\n\\end{align*} \\]\n\n### Reflections and Checks\n- The counts and operations make sense since the series indeed alternates and behaves predictably.\n  \n- Doubling back, the terms switch consistently between odd and even powers, lining up with our counts of 1006 odds and 1005 evens.\n\n- When calculating the sum, each odd power cancels exactly with the preceding even term, but because we have more odds by one term, the sum naturally results in \\(-1\\).\n\nThere we have it, the final answer is \\(-1\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Remember, even powers of $-1$ equal $1$, and odd powers of $-1$ equal $-1$.  Therefore, $x + x^2 = -1 + (-1)^2 = -1 + 1 = 0$.  The next pair cancels out in the same way: $x^3 + x^4 = (-1)^3 + (-1)^4 = -1 + 1 = 0$.  Now, it is easy to see that the pattern continues for every pair of powers, all the way up to $x^{2009} + x^{2010}$.  Notice that $x^{2011}$ is the only power that hasn't been canceled out.  Therefore, the answer is $(-1)^{2011} = \\boxed{-1}.$"
