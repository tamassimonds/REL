    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem together by thinking it through step-by-step. Here we go:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirstly, let's read the problem carefully: We have two similar triangles, \\( \\triangle ABC \\) and \\( \\triangle XYZ \\). We know the side lengths of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) as \\( AB = 4 \\) units, \\( BC = 6 \\) units. Additionally, we're given that side \\( XY \\) in \\( \\triangle XYZ \\) measures 14 units. We need to find the measure of side \\( YZ \\).\n\n**First thoughts:** This problem involves similar triangles, so we know the sides are proportional. That's key. Various strategies might involve setting up proportions or using a known ratio. Let's see how this logic plays out.\n\n### Step 2: Strategy and Formulating the Proportions\n\nGiven that the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides in the triangles will be the same. Here, \\( AB \\) corresponds to \\( XY \\) and \\( BC \\) corresponds to \\( YZ \\).\n\n**Brainstorming methods:** \n1. Set up the proportion based on corresponding sides.\n2. Calculate \\( YZ \\) using this proportion.\n\nLet's go with the first method since establishing a proportion should get us directly to the result.\n\n### Step 3: Setting Up the Proportion and Calculation\n\nThe corresponding sides of the triangles mean:\n\\[ \\frac{AB}{XY} = \\frac{BC}{YZ} \\]\n\nPlug in the values we know:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{14} = \\frac{6}{YZ} \\]\n\nThe proportion can help us solve for \\( YZ \\). \n\nThis is a simple proportion that can be cross-multiplied:\n\\[ 4 \\cdot YZ = 14 \\cdot 6 \\]\n\n**Quick check:** \\( 14 \\cdot 6 \\) is a basic multiplication, let me ensure it's correct:\n\\[ 14 \\times 6 = 84 \\]\n\nLooks right. Let's proceed:\n\n\\[ 4 \\cdot YZ = 84 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4 to solve for \\( YZ \\):\n\\[ YZ = \\frac{84}{4} = 21 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Verification\n\n**Reflecting:** Since I\u2019ve used a direct proportion based on corresponding sides and their ratios from similar triangles, this seems correct. Dividing 84 by 4 must yield the correct side length in the similar triangle context.\n\n**Final Check:** The ratio of side \\( AB \\) to \\( XY \\) is \\( \\frac{4}{14} = \\frac{2}{7} \\). Similarly, the ratio \\( \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7} \\), which checks out with the triangles being similar. Looks good.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe measure of side \\( YZ \\) is \\( 21 \\) units. \n\nThis step-by-step process shows that we leveraged properties of similar triangles effectively, validated the work with reflections and recalculations, showing the methodical approach for solving this problem.",

  "ground_truth": "Because triangle $ABC$ is similar to triangle $XYZ,$ $\\frac{AB}{XY}=\\frac{BC}{YZ}.$ Plugging in the values we are given yields \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{4}{14} &= \\frac{6}{YZ}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{4\\cdot YZ}{14} &= 6\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4\\cdot YZ &= 84\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad YZ &= \\boxed{21}.\n\\end{align*}"
