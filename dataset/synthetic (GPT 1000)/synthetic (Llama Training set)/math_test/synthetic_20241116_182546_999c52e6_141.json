    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\nImmediately, I notice that we have a function involving terms with both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and we're asked to find a minimum value subject to the condition \\(a > 2b > 0\\). This seems like it could require optimization techniques or inequality manipulations. \n\nThe structure of the expression has two parts: \\(3a^3 \\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{ab - 2b^2}\\). My initial thinking is that one of these parts might dominate the expression, or they might somehow balance each other out. This might be similar to some optimization problems I've seen where certain constraints guide you towards a sweet spot or balance point. \n\n### Exploring Strategy\n\n#### Expression Simplification and Intuition\n\n1. **Understand each term:**\n   - The term \\(3a^3 \\sqrt{3}\\) suggests focusing on \\(a\\) because increasing \\(a\\) will emphatically increase this part of the expression.\n   - The term \\(\\frac{2}{ab - 2b^2}\\) highlights a need for this denominator \\(ab - 2b^2\\) to be kept positive (due to the condition \\(a > 2b\\)). Intuitively, if the denominator is very small, the fraction becomes very large, dramatically increasing this term.\n\n2. **Viability of boundary testing:**\n   - I suspect that equality \\(a = 2b\\) might help in checking an interesting critical point because the inequality condition becomes an equality, often a useful exploration point despite the open inequality.\n\n#### Analyzing Extremes\n\n- Let\u2019s consider if we make \\(a\\) large while keeping \\(2b\\) smaller than \\(a\\), then \\(3a^3 \\sqrt{3}\\) grows rapidly.\n- Similarly, making \\(b\\) small might decrease \\(ab - 2b^2\\), increasing \\(\\frac{2}{ab - 2b^2}\\), but within limits, it keeps the denominator positive.\n\n### Mathematical Exploration\n\n#### Attempt with \\(a\\) expressed in terms of \\(b\\)\n\nSince we have the constraint \\(a > 2b\\), let me define \\(a = 2b + c\\) where \\(c > 0\\). This implicitly respects our constraint.\n\n- **Rewriting the expression:**\n\n  \\[\n  ab - 2b^2 = (2b + c)b - 2b^2 = cb\n  \\]\n\n  Then the expression becomes:\n\n  \\[\n  3(2b + c)^3\\sqrt{3} + \\frac{2}{cb}\n  \\]\n\n  This still feels a bit unwieldy considering \\(c > 0\\).\n\n#### Consider a simpler case\n\nIf we test \\(a = 3b\\) (a straightforward test within constraints), we obtain:\n\n- **Evaluate each part:**\n  \\[\n  3a^3 \\sqrt{3} = 3(3b)^3 \\sqrt{3} = 81b^3 \\sqrt{3}\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  ab - 2b^2 = 3b^2 - 2b^2 = b^2\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{2}{ab - 2b^2} = \\frac{2}{b^2}\n  \\]\n\n  So, our expression becomes:\n\n  \\[\n  81b^3 \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{2}{b^2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Attempt optimization:** Setting the derivative of this with respect to \\(b\\) likely will yield useful critical points, but it quickly becomes algebraically dense. It might suggest that simpler selections exist.\n\n### Re-evaluation and Alternate Direction\n\n- **Alternate scale variable:**\n  If I switch to exploring bounds on both sides, and perhaps change \\(b\\) in terms of a considered minimized scope, this might give cleaner results.\n\n###\n\nOh! Let's try finding symmetry directly in known boundaries:\n\nSet \\(a = 2b + \\epsilon\\), where \\(\\epsilon\\) is very small, then evaluate close to equal yet valid bounds.\n\n\\[ \na = 2b + \\epsilon \\quad \\implies cb = \\epsilon b \\quad (targeting simpler fraction)\n\\]\n\n- Alternative consideration by symmetry suggests solutions akin to boundary balancing \\(b\\).\n\n- **Test for small \\(\\epsilon\\):**\n  Check the limit solution as \\(\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0\\).\n\n  In doing so, recalculate for minimizing redundant dominance and consider evaluation from bracketed approaches.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNow that I have re-evaluated these approaches, it seems when testing key boundary value choices and their relative constraints, particular guide tries effectively illustrate minimum evaluations but memaining algebra confirms a generally heavy system testing required.\n\nThus, it seems convergence and directed algebra in a systematic context support underpinning boundary result derivations. Hopefully, this offering is yielding the right balance of understanding.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous attempt. Let's re-evaluate the problem by focusing on exploring a range of different strategies, making sure we properly incorporate any constraints and symmetry.\n\n### Re-exploring the Problem\n\nFirst, we need to ensure we're clear on the expression and the condition: \n\nWe are trying to find the minimum value of:\n\\[\n3a^3 \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{2}{ab - 2b^2}\n\\]\ngiven the condition \\(a > 2b > 0\\).\n\n### Analyzing the Problem\n\nMy initial approach was to explore boundary testing by assuming simple values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), such as \\(a = 3b\\). However, this may not necessarily lead to the minimum value under the given constraint. Let's consider a different approach.\n\n### A Different Approach\n\nI realized I should focus more on balancing the terms in the inequality and perhaps using symmetry and known inequalities, such as AM-GM, to find a more algebraic solution:\n\n1. **Consider constraints and simplification:**\n\n   Let's simplify \\(\\frac{2}{ab - 2b^2} = \\frac{2}{b(a - 2b)}\\). To make the denominator large, which minimizes the fraction, we test \\(a = 4b\\), and observe how the terms behave.\n\n2. **Use substitution and test ranges:**\n\n   Consider expressing \\(a\\) in terms of \\(b\\) or vice versa and try substitution that might allow simplification:\n   - Define \\(b = \\frac{a}{4}\\), which respects the condition \\(a > 2b\\).\n\n3. **Apply the AM-GM inequality:**\n\n   Using this choice: \n   \n   - Simplify the expression:\n     \\[\n     ab - 2b^2 = a\\left(\\frac{a}{4}\\right) - 2\\left(\\frac{a}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{a^2}{4} - \\frac{a^2}{8} = \\frac{a^2}{8}\n     \\]\n   \n   - Substitute into the main expression:\n     \\[\n     3a^3 \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{2}{\\frac{a^2}{8}} = 3a^3 \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{16}{a^2}\n     \\]\n   \n4. **Analyze the balanced state:**\n\n   Now, use AM-GM inequality for balancing:\n   - Express as a sum of positives:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3a^3 \\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{3a^3 \\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{16}{3a^2} + \\frac{16}{3a^2} + \\frac{16}{3a^2}\n     \\]\n   - Apply AM-GM:\n     \\[\n     \\ge 5 \\sqrt[5]{\\left(\\frac{3a^3 \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{16}{3a^2}\\right)^3}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solving for equality condition:**\n\n   Calculate by setting equality for AM-GM:\n   - \\(\\frac{3a^3 \\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{16}{3a^2}\\)\n   - Solve for \\(a\\), giving \\(a = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), and consequently, \\(b = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\).\n\n6. **Verify minimum value:**\n\n   Substituting back into the function confirms:\n   \\[\n   3a^3 \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{16}{a^2} = 20\n   \\]\n\nThis solution indicates that the minimum value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{20}\\), achievable when \\(a = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) and \\(b = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\), as intended from the beginning by ensuring that both parts are balanced optimally through the AM-GM inequality and the choice of \\(b = \\frac{a}{4}\\).",
