    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. The task is to simplify the expression \\((3-i)(6+2i)\\). This involves multiplying complex numbers. Let me think out loud here and keep it as natural as possible.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- When I see \\((3-i)(6+2i)\\), my mind jumps to the multiplication technique used for binomials, specifically the FOIL method (First, Outer, Inner, Last). This seems like a promising approach since complex numbers can be treated like binomials with real and imaginary parts.\n\n- Alternatively, I could think of the expression as distributing each term from one complex number to the other, but that essentially amounts to the same approach as FOIL.\n\n- Hmm, I don't see any immediate roadblocks to using FOIL here, but it's worth reflecting that multiplying complex numbers will result in another complex number, likely involving both a real part and an imaginary part.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. Use the FOIL method to expand the expression.\n2. Simplify each component and combine like terms.\n3. Remember that \\(i^2 = -1\\) should be used when necessary.\n\nOkay, let's try the FOIL method step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Apply FOIL**\n\n- **First:** Multiply the first terms of each binomial: \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\).\n\n- **Outer:** Multiply the outer terms: \\(3 \\times 2i = 6i\\).\n\n- **Inner:** Multiply the inner terms: \\(-i \\times 6 = -6i\\).\n\n- **Last:** Multiply the last terms: \\(-i \\times 2i = -2i^2\\).\n\nNow let\u2019s see what we have from each of these steps:\n\n- First gives us: \\(18\\)\n- Outer gives us: \\(6i\\)\n- Inner gives us: \\(-6i\\)\n- Last gives us: \\(-2i^2\\)\n\nLet's pause and simplify:\n\n**Step 2: Simplify**\n\n- Combine the real parts: We have \\(18\\) and \\(-2i^2\\). But hold on a second. \\(i^2 = -1\\), so \\(-2i^2 = -2(-1) = 2\\). Therefore, we actually combine \\(18 + 2 = 20\\).\n\n- Combine the imaginary parts: \\(6i - 6i = 0i\\). Okay, this simplifies nicely to just zero.\n\n**Reflect:**\n\n- Alright, so we combined the real parts to get \\(20\\) and the imaginary parts canceled each other out to \\(0\\).\n\n- Does this make sense? Let's reflect if this is reasonable. Both real and imaginary parts were handled correctly, and I used \\(i^2 = -1\\) appropriately.\n\n- Also, a quick mental check: \\(18 + 2 = 20\\), and the imaginary parts \\(6i\\) and \\(-6i\\) do indeed cancel out. Looks reasonable!\n\n**Final Result:**\n\nThe simplified form of \\((3-i)(6+2i)\\) is \\(20\\).\n\nThis makes sense, given how the imaginary components canceled each other out and left us with only a real number. \n\nSo, we conclude that the result of the operation is: **\\(20\\)**.",
