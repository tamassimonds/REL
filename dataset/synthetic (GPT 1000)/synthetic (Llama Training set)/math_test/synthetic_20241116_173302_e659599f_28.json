    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive in and tackle this problem step by step. I\u2019m going to let my thoughts flow naturally, so bear with me through the process.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\nWhen I first looked at the equation \\(6^x + 6^x + 6^x + 6^x + 6^x + 6^x = 6^6\\), my mind immediately recognized this as a sum where the same term is repeated multiple times. That suggests some kind of simplification could lead directly to the solution.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategy:**\n\n1. **Simplification by factoring:** \n   My first thought is to factor out the common terms. Since \\(6^x\\) is repeated six times, it can be expressed as \\(6 \\times 6^x\\).\n\n2. **Equation Balance:**\n   This can then be set equal to the right side of the equation, which is \\(6^6\\).\n\n3. **Use of properties of exponents:**\n   I recall the property of exponents: \\(a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}\\). In this equation, I might need to use this property to relate the numbers.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s proceed with these steps:\n\n**Step-by-Step Execution:**\n\n1. **Factor the Left Side:**\n\n   I notice \\(6^x\\) is repeated six times. So the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 6^x = 6^6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Relate via multiplication:**\n\n   Next, I think about using properties of exponents to solve. The left side of the equation can also be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   6^1 \\times 6^x = 6^6\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   6^{x+1} = 6^6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compare the exponents:**\n\n   Since the bases are the same (\\(6\\)), I can equate the exponents:\n   \\[\n   x + 1 = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n\n   Solving \\(x + 1 = 6\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   x = 6 - 1 = 5\n   \\]\n\n   So, \\(x = 5\\).\n\n**Reflection and Quick Check:**\n\n- This feels correct because each step used straightforward exponent rules. Since I've equated the exponents and completed the algebra correctly, \\(x = 5\\) aligns logically with the original given equation.\n- A quick sanity check by substituting back: \n  \\[\n  6 \\times 6^5 = 6^6 \n  \\]\n  This simplifies to the same expression on both sides, confirming the solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI've systematically simplified and solved the problem using known exponential properties. Everything checks out nicely, so I feel confident that \\(x = 5\\) is the correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "There are 6 $6^x$ terms, so we can rewrite the equation as $6(6^x)=6^6$. Dividing both sides by 6, we get $6^x=6^5$, so $x=\\boxed{5}.$"
