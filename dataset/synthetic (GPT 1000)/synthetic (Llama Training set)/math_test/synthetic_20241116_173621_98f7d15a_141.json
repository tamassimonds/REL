    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. It looks like we\u2019re dealing with a polynomial inequality over an interval. Specifically, we have a quadratic function \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) that remains within the bounds of \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) for \\(x\\) in the interval \\([0, 1]\\). Our goal is to maximize the sum of the absolute values \\(|a| + |b| + |c|\\).\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n1. **Understanding the Constraint**: The inequality \\(|ax^2 + bx + c| \\leq 1\\) suggests that for any \\(x\\) in \\([0, 1]\\), the value of the polynomial does not go below -1 or above 1. This means the polynomial is \"squeezed\" within the strip between the lines \\(y = -1\\) and \\(y = 1\\).\n\n2. **Maximizing \\(|a| + |b| + |c|\\)**: I need to find the largest possible sum \\(|a| + |b| + |c|\\), which often involves exploring what happens at the critical points of the interval \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 1\\). Also, the behavior of the polynomial within the interval matters.\n\n3. **Boundary Behavior**: Let's focus on the boundaries: at \\(x = 0\\), the condition \\( \\|c| \\leq 1\\) must hold because \\(ax^2 + bx + c = c\\). Similarly, at \\(x = 1\\), we have the condition \\(|a + b + c| \\leq 1\\).\n\n4. **Involving Critical Points**: The critical point here for such a quadratic would be where its derivative zeroes, potentially affecting the extremal values in \\([0, 1]\\). The derivative \\(2ax + b = 0\\) gives us a critical point at \\(x = -\\frac{b}{2a}\\). This needs consideration only if it lies within \\([0, 1]\\).\n\n### Testing the What-ifs and Approximations\n\nI want to start testing simple values and consider symmetrical forms of quadratics like \\(p(x) = ax^2 - ax\\) or even \\(p(x) = a(2x^2 - 2x)\\), while considering the boundary conditions above simultaneously. The symmetry might help manage the max bounds simultaneously.\n\n### Trying Specific Values\n\nLet's test \\(p(x) = 2x^2 - 2x + 1\\), since:\n- At \\(x=0\\), \\(p(0) = 1\\).\n- At \\(x=1\\), \\(p(1) = 1\\).\n- This polynomial is symmetrically designed with values \\(|p(x)| \\leq 1\\) over \\([0,1]\\).\n\nCalculate \\(|a| + |b| + |c|\\):\n- Identify the polynomial \\(p(x) = 2x^2 - 2x + 1\\), gives coefficients \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = -2\\), \\(c = 1\\).\n- Calculate: \\(|a| + |b| + |c| = |2| + |-2| + |1| = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5\\).\n\n### Validating and Adjusting\n\nTo ensure correctness, the polynomial should satisfy the inequality at multiple strategic points between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) apart from edges, like \\(x=\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n- \\(p\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 1 = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + 1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nNow, \\(|\\frac{1}{2}| \\leq 1\\), appears to meet conditions... Hmm, something rings differently. Let's internally test more or recompute by other functions, like different plugs \\(x=0.25, 0.75\\).\n\n### Verifying Alternate Extremes\n\nUpon revisiting function trials such as \\(p(x) = -2x^2 + 2x + 1\\), check a calculated permissible set in finite bounds showing \\(|a'| + |b'| + |c'|\\):\n\n1. It safely follows limit \\(L = 6\\) led from derived coefficients of other tried forms maintaining step validity.\n2. This involves ensuring when recalculating \\(|p(x)| \\leq 1\\) consistently confirming bounds.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe evaluated value of \\(|a| + |b| + |c| = 6\\) emerges as plausible logically from such trials/adjustments. Remaining consistent to the maximality condition method; possible considerations include full evaluations.\n\nIrregular thought might reluctantly yield yet hints upon affirming redefining consistent feasible polynomial forms poised significant variance! \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f \ud83c\udfaf\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's re-examine the problem and explore different strategies to find the correct value for \\(|a| + |b| + |c|\\).\n\n### Revisiting the Problem\n\nThe core problem is a quadratic inequality:\n\n\\[ |ax^2 + bx + c| \\le 1, \\]\n\nwhich must hold for \\(0 \\le x \\le 1\\). Our task is to find the maximum value of \\(|a| + |b| + |c|\\).\n\n### Reflecting on Initial Assumptions\n\nInitially, I considered specific forms of quadratic functions and calculated \\(|a| + |b| + |c|\\) using simple test cases. However, this approach didn't yield the largest possible value. Let's re-evaluate the approach to ensure consistency with the problem constraints.\n\n### Formulating a New Approach\n\n1. **Constraints and Critical Points**: \n   - At \\(x = 0\\), we have \\(|c| \\le 1\\).\n   - At \\(x = 1\\), we have \\(|a + b + c| \\le 1\\).\n   - At \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\), we have another key constraint: \n\n     \\[ \\left| \\frac{a}{4} + \\frac{b}{2} + c \\right| \\le 1. \\]\n\n2. **System of Equations and Re-Evaluation**:\n\n   Let's express the conditions through variables:\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   p &= c, \\\\\n   q &= \\frac{a}{4} + \\frac{b}{2} + c, \\\\\n   r &= a + b + c,\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\(-1 \\le p, q, r \\le 1\\). \n\n3. **Solving the System**:\n\n   Using the above relationships, solve for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   a &= 2p - 4q + 2r, \\\\\n   b &= -3p + 4q - r, \\\\\n   c &= p.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Maximizing \\(|a| + |b| + |c|\\)**:\n\n   Let's apply the triangle inequality:\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   |a| &= |2p - 4q + 2r| \\le |2p| + |4q| + |2r| = 8, \\\\\n   |b| &= |-3p + 4q - r| \\le |3p| + |4q| + |r| = 8, \\\\\n   |c| &= |p| \\le 1.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n   Hence, the maximum value of \\(|a| + |b| + |c|\\) is \\(|2p| + |4q| + |2r| + |3p| + |r| + |p| = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17\\).\n\n### Verification with a Specific Quadratic\n\nConsider the polynomial \\(f(x) = 8x^2 - 8x + 1\\). This can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[ f(x) = 8 \\left( x - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 - 1. \\]\n\nFor \\(0 \\le x \\le 1\\), we have:\n\n\\[ 0 \\le \\left( x - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 \\le \\frac{1}{4}, \\]\n\nimplying \\( -1 \\le f(x) \\le 1 \\). This satisfies the inequality throughout the interval.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of \\(|a| + |b| + |c|\\) is \\(\\boxed{17}\\).\n\nReflecting on this process, I see how the algebraic exploration and careful handling of conditions align with the problem requirements, leading to the correct solution.",
