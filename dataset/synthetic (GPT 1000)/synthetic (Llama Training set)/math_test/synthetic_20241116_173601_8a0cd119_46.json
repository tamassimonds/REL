    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this step by step. I'll let my thoughts flow as if I'm working through it naturally.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- The problem seems to boil down to finding a common point for two cycles (watering every 9 days and feeding every 60 days). This reminds me of finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM), which is a concept I've encountered in similar cycle problems.\n- First, I need to write down the two cycles: 9 days for watering, and 60 days for feeding.\n- Last watering and feeding was on a Tuesday. So, we're trying to find out when the day of the week will again be a Tuesday after some common multiple of days has passed.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n- Approach 1: Calculate the LCM of 9 and 60. \n  - Okay, 9 = 3\u00b2 and 60 = 2\u00b2 * 3 * 5. Hm, to find the LCM, I need to pick the highest powers of each prime number: 2\u00b2, 3\u00b2, and 5. Multiply these together to find the LCM.\n  - LCM = 2\u00b2 * 3\u00b2 * 5 = 4 * 9 * 5. Let me quickly calculate that...\n  - 4 * 9 = 36. And then, 36 * 5 = Wow, this equals 180 days.\n  - Alright, so the common cycle for both tasks is every 180 days.\n\n- Approach 2 (sanity check): Count forward on days of the week to see if the math holds.\n  - If I count by week intervals, every 7 days the weekday stays the same. 180 / 7 = 25 with no remainder. Hmm, no remainder means that 180 days from Tuesday is still going to be a Tuesday. That feels correct.\n\n### Reflecting on the Approach\n\n- Looks good\u2014the LCM approach is sound. Finding the same weekday after multiples of 7 backs up my initial calculation.\n- I'm confident now, since everything checks out with the weekday cycle as well.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- By calculating the LCM of the watering and feeding cycles, we found 180 days is when both events coincide. Double-checking using week cycles confirmed that it will again be a Tuesday after 180 days.\n- Therefore, Arnold will water and feed the plants at the same time again on a Tuesday, 180 days from the last event.\n\n### Final Check\n\n- One last mental run to verify: If today was Tuesday, 180 days from today lands directly on another Tuesday because 180 is a multiple of the 7-day week.\n- Feeling confident we've got this locked down. The next watering and feeding on the same day happens in 180 days, on a Tuesday.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous reasoning. Let me take another look at this and go through the steps again to ensure that I arrive at the correct conclusion this time.\n\n### Revisiting the Problem\n\nInitially, I computed the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the two cycles, which is 180 days, but I miscalculated the day of the week. Let's double-check the logic around the day of the week:\n\n1. **Cycles:** Arnold waters every 9 days and feeds every 60 days. The LCM of these two numbers will tell us when both tasks coincide. From the initial calculation, we have:\n\n   - LCM of 9 and 60 is 180 days.\n\n2. **Day of the Week Calculation:** We last determined that both tasks happen together on a Tuesday. We need to find out what day 180 days from a Tuesday is.\n\n   - 180 days needs to be divided by 7 to determine the shift in weekdays, because there are 7 days in a week.\n\n3. **Calculating the Day of the Week:**\n\n   - Compute \\(180 \\div 7\\), which gives a quotient of 25 and a remainder of 5. This tells us that 180 days is exactly 25 weeks and 5 days.\n   - Therefore, starting from a Tuesday and adding 5 days lands us on a Sunday.\n\n### Reflecting on the Correct Approach\n\n- The initial calculation of 180 days was correct for the cycle length, but I overlooked the weekday calculation. \n- By computing the remainder of 180 divided by 7, I correctly aligned the days of the week to find that the next day Arnold will water and feed his cactus on the same day is indeed a Sunday.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWith this corrected understanding and careful recount, the day of the week when Arnold will water and feed his plants again on the same day is a **Sunday**. This conclusion aligns perfectly with the computation: 180 days counted from a Tuesday, adjusting for the weekly cycle, lands us precisely five days later, on a Sunday.",
