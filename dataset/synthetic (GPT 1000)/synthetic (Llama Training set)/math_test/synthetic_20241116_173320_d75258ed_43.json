    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, making sure to go through the brainstorming, checking, and re-evaluating processes naturally.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem, we have two circles with a radius of 1 unit each that are externally tangent. They're also tangent to three sides of a rectangle. The mention of tangency and finding areas immediately makes me think of circles snugly fitting inside shapes, touching their boundaries.\n\nSince the circles are tangent externally and each tangent to three sides of a rectangle, they must be positioned such that they span the width or height of the rectangle. My initial thought is that they could be horizontally aligned if they have a common tangent segment touching them externally.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nLet's visualize: \n- Two circles externally tangent to each other means they are just touching each other at one point. \n- Each circle is tangent to three sides, suggesting perhaps the circles fit snugly against a pair of opposite corners within the rectangle.\n\n**Exploration of Strategies:**\n\n1. **Get a Handle on Circle Positions:** If each circle is tangent to three sides of the rectangle, imagine placing them at either top corners or bottom corners with their center on the vertical center line of the rectangle meeting on a side opposite the other three \"touch\" points.\n\n2. **Dimensions of Rectangle:** \n   - Since the circles are of radius 1 unit and they touch three sides: let\u2019s assume one circle\u2019s center is at (1,1), making it touch left, top, and bottom.\n   - Similarly, if the second circle's center is at (3,1), then it touches right, top, and bottom.\n\n**Reflect and Calculate:**\n\n- **Width of Rectangle:** This suggests a width of 2 units when they are aligned this way, because the total distance along the x-axis spanned by both centers would be the sum of the radii plus the distance between closest points (which is zero at their touching point), which is 2 (1+1).\n\n- **Height of Rectangle:** Since the circles are tangent to the top and bottom, the height of the rectangle should be twice the radius, giving a height of 2 units.\n\n**Aha Moment:**\n\nWith these circles being positioned in a 2 by 2 rectangle, the shaded area is essentially the area of the rectangle minus the areas of the two circles. \n\n**Formulate the Solution:**\n\n- **Area of the rectangle**: Since width and height both equal 2, then area = 2 * 2 = 4 square units.\n\n- **Area of each circle**: Since each has a radius of 1, the formula for area is \\(\\pi \\times (\\text{radius})^2\\), giving \\(\\pi \\times 1^2 = \\pi\\) for one circle. \n\n- **Total area of circles**: Since there are two circles, it's \\(2\\pi\\).\n\nNow you'd subtract the area of the circles from the area of the rectangle to find the area of the shaded region.\n\n**Calculated Shaded Region Area:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Shaded area} = \\text{Area of rectangle} - \\text{Total area of circles} = 4 - 2\\pi. \\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThis calculation makes sense given the constraints and the solution setup. Everything checks out with the alignment and fitting within the rectangle.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe area of the shaded region is \\(4 - 2\\pi\\).\n\nAh, I see I've made an error in my initial solution. Let's go back and reassess the problem, making sure to adjust the dimensions and calculations appropriately.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Problem:**\n\nUpon reflection, I realize I misunderstood the arrangement of the circles and the dimensions of the rectangle. Let's approach this systematically:\n\n**Reconsider the Circle Placement and Rectangle Dimensions:**\n\n1. **Diameter and Circle Placement:**\n   - Each circle has a diameter of 2 units (since each radius is 1 unit). This detail suggests that these circles will be placed such that their diameters dictate the dimensions of the rectangle.\n   - If the circles are side by side, they will span the entire length of the rectangle.\n\n2. **Rectangle Dimensions:**\n   - Given that the circles have diameters of 2 units, and assuming they are placed side by side, the width of the rectangle must accommodate the sum of the two diameters, making it 4 units wide.\n   - Since the circles are also tangent to the top and bottom edges, the height of the rectangle matches the diameter of a single circle, which is 2 units.\n\n**Formulating the Correct Solution:**\n\n- **Area of the Rectangle:** Using the width and height deduced above, the rectangle's area is calculated as \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) square units.\n\n- **Area of Each Circle:** With a radius of 1, the area of one circle is \\(\\pi \\times 1^2 = \\pi\\). For two circles, the combined area is \\(2\\pi\\).\n\n- **Shaded Area Calculation:** The shaded area is found by subtracting the area occupied by the circles from the total area of the rectangle:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Shaded area} = \\text{Area of rectangle} - \\text{Total area of circles} = 8 - 2\\pi.\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis calculation matches the expected setup and constraints, clarifying the correct configuration and confirming the solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe area of the shaded region is \\(8 - 2\\pi\\). This aligns with the corrected understanding of how the circles and rectangle interact.",

  "ground_truth": "Each diameter of a circle is 2 units. The rectangle is 2 diameters by 1 diameter, or 4 units by 2 units. Its area is thus 8 square units. Each circle has an area of $1^2\\pi=\\pi$ square units, so the two circles have a combined area of $2\\pi$ square units. The total shaded area is that of the rectangle minus that of the excluded circles, or $\\boxed{8-2\\pi}$ square units."
