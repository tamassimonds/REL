    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step with as much transparency as possible regarding my thought process.\n\nFirst Thoughts: \nWhen I look at the equation \\(x^2 = -|x|\\), my first reaction is that this seems a bit unusual. We have a square on the left side and a certain absolute value with a negative sign on the right. It reminds me of problems where I need to compare polynomials or where absolute values introduce piecewise behaviors.\n\nUnderstanding the Components:\n1. **Absolute Value Aspect:** \\(|x|\\) represents the non-negative value of \\(x\\). Regardless of whether \\(x\\) is positive or negative, \\(|x|\\) is always non-negative. So the right side \\(-|x|\\) will always be non-positive (zero or negative).\n\n2. **Square Aspect:** \\(x^2\\) represents the square of \\(x\\). Squares are always non-negative because multiplying a negative by a negative gives a positive, and a positive by a positive remains positive. This tells me \\(x^2 \\geq 0\\).\n\nHmm, there's a conflict here because the equation equates the non-negative square \\(x^2\\) to the non-positive \\(-|x|\\), which narrows down the possibilities.\n\nExploring Possible Solutions:\nTo find any \\(x\\) that satisfies the equation, I should start by considering simple cases:\n\n- **Case 1: \\(x = 0\\)**  \n  If \\(x = 0\\), then \\(x^2 = 0\\) and \\(-|x| = 0\\). Okay, so for \\(x = 0\\), both sides can be zero. That works. This is one solution: \\(x = 0\\).\n\n- **Case 2: \\(x > 0\\)**  \n  Here, \\(|x| = x\\), so \\(-|x| = -x\\). The equation becomes:\n  \\[\n  x^2 = -x\n  \\]\n  Rearrange to get:\n  \\[\n  x^2 + x = 0\n  \\]\n  Factor the equation:\n  \\[\n  x(x + 1) = 0\n  \\]\n  Solutions are \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = -1\\). As we're considering \\(x > 0\\), only \\(x = 0\\) is relevant, but we've already considered \\(x = 0\\).\n\n- **Case 3: \\(x < 0\\)**  \n  For this, \\(|x| = -x\\), so \\(-|x| = x\\). The equation becomes:\n  \\[\n  x^2 = x\n  \\]\n  Rearrange to:\n  \\[\n  x^2 - x = 0\n  \\]\n  Factor:\n  \\[\n  x(x - 1) = 0\n  \\]\n  This gives \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = 1\\). However, since we're in the \\(x < 0\\) scenario, neither \\(x = 0\\) nor \\(x = 1\\) fits. This case yields no new solutions.\n\nReflecting on Findings:\nAfter considering each possibility, I've identified \\(x = 0\\) as the only valid solution where both the square of \\(x\\) (non-negative) equals the negative of the absolute value of \\(x\\) (non-positive).\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nAfter navigating through all cases (positive, zero, negative), I've confirmed that the only solution to the equation \\(x^2 = -|x|\\) is \\(x = 0\\).\n\nOh, wait! Let\u2019s quickly double-check everything. If I ganged through each scenario correctly, it reinforces my understanding and solidifies the answer. Feels about right!\n\nSo, there is exactly one solution to this equation, which is \\(x = 0\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We can see that $x^2$ is nonnegative.  But clearly, $-|x|$ is nonpositive.  Thus the only solutions can occur where $x^2 = -|x| = 0$.  This happens if and only if $x=0$, and so the given equation has exactly $\\boxed{1}$ solution."
