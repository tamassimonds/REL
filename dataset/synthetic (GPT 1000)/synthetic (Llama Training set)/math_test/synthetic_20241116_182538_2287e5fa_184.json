At first glance, the requirements about the hole and asymptotes give me the feeling that we'll be working with factors in the numerator and denominator to control these features. A hole means a common factor in the numerator and denominator, while a vertical asymptote often results from a zero in the denominator that isn't canceled out by the numerator.\n\nLet's start with what's given:\n\n1. **Hole at \\( x = 2 \\):** This implies that both the numerator and \\( q(x) \\) have a factor of \\( (x-2) \\). \n2. **Vertical Asymptote at \\( x = -1 \\):** This suggests that \\( q(x) \\) has a factor \\( (x+1) \\) that is not canceled by the numerator.\n3. **No Horizontal Asymptote:** Typically, this relates to the degrees of the polynomials. Here the degree of the numerator is 3, so \\( q(x) \\) must have a degree less than 3, or 2, to ensure there's no horizontal asymptote. \n4. **\\( q(1) = -6 \\):** A specific value we need to use as a final check.\n\n### Breaking it Down\n\nWith these conditions, let's start constructing \\( q(x) \\):\n\n#### Step 1: Handling the Hole\n\nTo get a hole at \\( x=2 \\), both the numerator and \\( q(x) \\) should have \\( (x-2) \\) as a factor. The numerator can be factored, revealing:\n\n\\[3x^3 - x^2 - 10x = x(3x^2 - x - 10)\\]\n\nLet's try synthetic or polynomial division to factor further, but for now, place our focus on the fact \\( x-2 \\) should cancel. This means:\n\n\\[ q(x) = (x-2)\\cdot \\text{(an expression not cancelling holes and height)} \\]\n\n#### Step 2: Vertical Asymptote\n\nAdd a factor to \\( q(x) \\): \\( (x+1) \\) such that it does not cancel with the numerator. To make sure we have a vertical asymptote at \\( x = -1 \\), add it not easily removable factor:\n\n\\[ q(x) = (x-2)(x+1)\\cdot \\text{g(x)}\\]\n\n#### Step 3: Degree Consideration for Asymptotes\n\nThe numerator is of degree 3, so ideally \\( q(x) \\) should be polynomial of degree 2, to achieve no horizontal asymptote, implying:\n\n\\[ g(x) = \\text{a constant or empty for balancing with degree}\\]\n\nSo we can leave \\( g(x) = 1 \\) to create initial guess,\n\n\\[ q(x) = (x-2)(x+1) = x^2 - x - 2 \\]\n\n#### Step 4: Checking \\( q(1) = -6 \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 1 \\) into this form of \\( q(x) \\):\n\n\\[ q(1) = (1)^2 - 1 - 2 = 1 - 1 - 2 = -2 \\]\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Since we want the result to be \\(-6\\), let's introduce scaling:\n\n\\[ q(x) = A((x-2)(x+1)) = A(x^2 - x - 2)\\]\n\nRe-calculate \\( A\\) with the equation set for condition 4:\n\n\\[ A(-2) =-6 \\]\n\\[ A = 3 \\]\n\nSo when we attempt replaced computation:\n\n\\[ q(x) = 3(x^2 - x - 2) = 3x^2 - 3x - 6 \\]\n\nRechecking:\n\nWe create the function:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3x^3-x^2-10x}{3x^2-3x-6}\\]\n\nNow check:\n  - Hole if cancels need to factorize numerator completely or confirm equivalence using original inside workings.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n\\[ q(x) = 3x^2 - 3x - 6 \\]\n\n**Summary of Checks and Balances:**\n\n1. **Hole:** \\(3x^3-x^2-10x) = (x-2)\\ldots\\)\n2. **Vertical Asymptote:** Occurs at \\( x = -1 \\).\n3. **No Horizontal Asymptote:** Degrees match requirement.\n4. **\\( q(1) = -6\\):** Rechecked, correct with added factor.\n\nThis feels aligned with all the original conditions \u2013 stepped through logically, thus reinforcing confidence in \\( q(x) = 3x^2 - 3x - 6 \\) is the right choice.",

  "ground_truth": "Factorising the numerator gives us\n$$\\frac{3x^3-x^2-10x}{q(x)} = \\frac{x(x-2)(3x+5)}{q(x)}.$$There will only be a hole at $x=2$ if both the numerator and denominator are $0$ when $x=2$. We can see that this is already true for the numerator, hence $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x-2$.\n\nSince there is a vertical asymptote at $x=-1$, $q(-1) = 0$. By the Factor theorem, $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x+1$.\n\nSince there is no horizontal asymptote, we know that the degree of $q(x)$ must be less than the degree of the numerator. The numerator has a degree of $3$, which means that $q(x)$ has degree at most $2$.\n\nPutting all of this together, we have that $q(x) = a(x-2)(x+1)$ for some constant $a$. Since $q(1) = -6$, we have $a(1-2)(1+1) = -6$. which we can solve to get $a = 3$.  Hence, $q(x) = \\boxed{3(x-2)(x+1)} = 3x^2-3x-6$."
