    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem and take it step by step.\n\n### Initial Reactions:\n1. \"Rewrite the expression \\(g^4 + 12g^2 + 9\\) in the form \\(c(g^2 + p)^2 + q\\).\" Hmm, this looks like it involves transforming a polynomial expression. It definitely resembles completing the square but in a different format.\n2. I've seen similar problems where completing the square or factorization comes into play. But I wonder if there's a more suitable method specific to this format.\n\n### First Thoughts:\n- Initially, I think the form \\(c(g^2 + p)^2 + q\\) resembles a perfect square trinomial. Perfect square trinomials usually look like \\(a(g^2)^2 + 2abg^2 + b^2\\).\n- I should try to match the given expression \\(g^4 + 12g^2 + 9\\) to this form.\n\n### Strategy Brainstorming:\n1. One strategy could be brute force: Expanding \\(c(g^2 + p)^2\\) and matching coefficients with \\(g^4 + 12g^2 + 9\\).\n2. Alternatively, maybe recognizing patterns or factorization might lead somewhere.\n\n### Move to Strategy Implementation:\n- Let's try expanding \\((g^2 + p)^2\\): \n  \\[\n  (g^2 + p)^2 = (g^2)^2 + 2pg^2 + p^2\n  \\]\n  So, when multiplied by \\(c\\), we have:\n  \\[\n  c(g^2 + p)^2 = cg^4 + 2cpg^2 + cp^2\n  \\]\n\n### Matching: \\(g^4 + 12g^2 + 9\\)\n- Compare terms step-by-step:\n  - **Term 1:** Coefficient of \\(g^4\\) should match. We have 1 in the original and \\(c\\) in the transformed expression, so \\(c = 1\\).\n  - **Term 2:** Coefficient of \\(g^2\\) equals \\(2cp\\), which should match with 12. Therefore, \\(2(1)p = 12\\) or \\(p = 6\\).\n  - **Term 3:** In the constant term: \\((cp^2)\\) should match with 9. So, substituting for \\(c = 1\\) and \\(p = 6\\), we check:\n    \\[\n    cp^2 = 1(6^2) = 36\n    \\]\n\n### Reflection and Correction:\n- Wait a second, something's off here. There's a discrepancy here with the constant term. \\(cp^2 = 36\\), but the original's constant term is 9. I forgot to add \\(q\\) to adjust this mismatch.\n- Looking back, we need: \n  \\[\n  36 + q = 9 \\Rightarrow q = 9 - 36\n  \\]\n\n### Final Steps:\n- Calculating \\(q\\):\n  \\[\n  q = 9 - 36 = -27\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n- By solving the mismatch with constant terms, I've found that the missing constant term, \\(q\\), must be \\(-27\\). This completes the transformation and makes the expressions equivalent.\n- Final form and verification:\n  \\[\n  g^4 + 12g^2 + 9 = 1(g^2 + 6)^2 - 27\n  \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\(q\\) is \\(-27\\).",
