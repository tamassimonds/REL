    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by first understanding what we're asked to do. We need to find the circumference of a circle defined by the equation \\( x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 12y - 4 = 0 \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nThis looks like the equation of a circle in standard form is \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius. Our given equation doesn't look like this yet - it's in a general quadratic form. I suspect we'll need to manipulate it into standard form to identify the radius.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Completing the square** seems like it might work. This method should help reorganize the equation into the standard circle format.\n\n2. Checking if I remember other circle equations or transformations that could simplify this, but nothing stands out that's as promising as completing the square.\n\n**Step-by-step Approach:**\n\n1. **Identify Terms to Complete the Square:**\n   - For the \\(x\\)-terms: \\(x^2 + 6x\\).\n   - For the \\(y\\)-terms: \\(y^2 - 12y\\).\n\n2. **Completing the Square for \\(x\\):**\n   - The idea is to transform \\(x^2 + 6x\\) into a perfect square trinomial. The formula is \\(x^2 + bx = (x + \\frac{b}{2})^2 - \\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2\\).\n   - Here, \\(b=6\\). So, \\((x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9\\). Thus, we need to add and subtract 9.\n\n3. **Completing the Square for \\(y\\):**\n   - Similarly, for \\(y^2 - 12y\\), use \\( (y^2 + by = (y + \\frac{b}{2})^2 - (\\frac{b}{2})^2) \\).\n   - Here, \\(b = -12\\). So \\((y - 6)^2 = y^2 - 12y + 36\\). We add and subtract 36.\n\n4. **Transforming the Original Equation:**\n   - Start with: \\(x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 12y - 4 = 0\\).\n   - Group and complete squares: \n     \\[\n     (x^2 + 6x + 9) + (y^2 - 12y + 36) = 9 + 36 + 4\n     \\]\n   - Based on completing squares, this becomes:\n     \\[(x + 3)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = 49\\]\n\n5. **Standard Form:**\n   - Now the equation is in the standard form \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\), with \\(h = -3\\), \\(k = 6\\), and \\(r^2 = 49\\).\n\n6. **Determine the Radius:**\n   - \\(r = \\sqrt{49} = 7\\).\n\n7. **Calculate the Circumference:**\n   - The circumference of a circle is \\(2\\pi r\\).\n   - Thus, \\(2\\pi \\times 7 = 14\\pi\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, so everything seems to check out. We've completed the square correctly and derived the radius. Calculating the circumference using \\(r = 7\\) gives us \\(14\\pi\\). I didn't run into any unexpected results, and each step led logically to the next, confirming the solution feels solid.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe circumference of the circle is \\(14\\pi\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Add $(6/2)^2$ and $(-12/2)^2$ to both sides to find that the given equation is equivalent to  \\[\n(x^2+6x +9)+(y^2-12y +36)=49.\n\\] The two trinomials on the left-hand side may be rewritten to give $(x+3)^2 + (y-6)^2 =7^2$. The set of points $(x,y)$ which satisfy this equation are a distance of 7 units from $(-3,6)$, by the Pythagorean theorem. Hence, the equation defines a circle of radius $7$, which implies that the circumference of the circle is $2 \\pi \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{14 \\pi}$."
