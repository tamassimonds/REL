    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and approach it step by step, thinking through it as I naturally would.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nThe expression given is \\(2^{(2^3)} - (2^2)^3\\). At first glance, I see exponents involved, so it looks like I'll need to evaluate powers of 2 first.\n\n- \\(2^{(2^3)}\\) looks like working with nested exponentiation. \n- \\((2^2)^3\\) is a straightforward power-of-a-power situation that I need to simplify.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate \\(2^{(2^3)}\\)\n\nStart with the inner expression:\n\n- Calculate \\(2^3\\): \n  \\[\n  2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\n  \\]\n  Now I need to compute \\(2^8\\).\n\n- Calculate \\(2^8\\): \n  \\[\n  2^8 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2\n  \\]\n\nRather than multiply one by one, I might remember a quick sequence: \n- \\(2^4 = 16\\) \n- Squaring gives \\(16^2 = 256\\) \n\nSo, \\(2^8 = 256\\).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate \\((2^2)^3\\)\n\nNow evaluate \\((2^2)\\) first:\n\n- Calculate \\(2^2\\): \n  \\[\n  2^2 = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n  \\]\n\nThen evaluate \\(4^3\\):\n- Calculate \\(4^3\\):\n  \\[\n  4^3 = 4 \\times 4 \\times 4\n  \\]\n  - Intermediate step, \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\)\n  - Final multiplication, \\(16 \\times 4 = 64\\)\n\nSo, \\((2^2)^3 = 64\\).\n\n### Step 4: Subtract the Results\n\nNow combine everything:\n\n- \\(2^{(2^3)} = 256\\)\n- \\((2^2)^3 = 64\\)\n\nSubtract the second from the first:\n\n\\[\n256 - 64 = 192\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Reflect on the Solution\n\nNow it's time to check if everything seems logical. Throughout the calculations, I incrementally checked powers, using intermediate steps for clarity, and all seemed consistent and correct.\n\nIs 192 a reasonable answer? Given the operations around powers of 2, it seems feasible. I calculated each exponentiation step separately; going through, each had confirmations of accuracy. I don't see \"glaring huge numbers\" that would suggest an error.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the solution to \\(2^{(2^3)} - (2^2)^3\\) is \\(\\boxed{192}\\).\n\nLet me take a moment to consider any possible shortcuts or alternative checks. Occasionally at this point, a momentum insight on shorter paths or confirmations comes. Comparing nested powers or basic transformations might show the same but couldn't initially notice any neat cancellations or quicker paths not explored. \n\nThis robust path checks out, and the calculated answer stands confidently as correct.",

  "ground_truth": "Recall that $\\left(a^m\\right)^n=a^{mn}$. Because of this, the second number is $\\left(2^2\\right)^3=2^{2\\cdot 3}=2^6$. Because the exponents in the first number are in parentheses, we must complete that exponentiation first. $2^3=8$, so the first number is $2^{(2^3)}=2^8$. Thus, we have  \\[2^8-2^6.\\] Evaluating these exponents and subtracting, we get $256-64=\\boxed{192}$."
