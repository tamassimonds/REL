    "working_out": "Alright, let's take a slow and thorough approach to solving this problem. At first glance, we're dealing with a problem in three-dimensional space which involves distances and constraints. Here's how I might start thinking through it:\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** \n   - We have a curve defined by the equation \\(xyz^2 = 2\\).\n   - We need to find the minimum distance from a point \\(P = (x, y, z)\\) on this curve to the origin \\((0, 0, 0)\\).\n\n2. **What Do We Know:** \n   - The distance \\( D \\) between a point \\(P(x, y, z)\\) and the origin is given by \\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\).\n   - We need to minimize \\( D \\), subject to the constraint \\( xyz^2 = 2 \\).\n\n3. **Possible Strategies to Solve:**\n   - Use the method of Lagrange multipliers, which is common for optimization problems with constraints.\n   - Substitute one variable using the constraint into the distance formula and minimize using calculus.\n   - Consider the geometry or symmetry of the problem for insights.\n\n### Step-by-Step Brainstorming and Approach\n\n**Step 1: Setting Up the Problem**\n\nFirst, let's try expressing one variable in terms of the others to see if that simplifies things. From \\( xyz^2 = 2 \\), we can solve for one variable:\n\n\\[ z^2 = \\frac{2}{xy} \\]\n\nThis isn't very helpful by itself for expressing things neatly, so let's hold on this and consider Lagrange multipliers.\n\n**Step 2: Using Lagrange Multipliers**\n\n- Objective function (distance squared): \\( f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\).\n- Constraint: \\( g(x, y, z) = xyz^2 - 2 = 0 \\).\n\nWe form the Lagrangian:\n\n\\[ \\mathcal{L}(x, y, z, \\lambda) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + \\lambda(xyz^2 - 2) \\]\n\nWe take partial derivatives and set them to zero:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial x} = 2x + \\lambda yz^2 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial y} = 2y + \\lambda xz^2 = 0 \\)\n3. \\( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial z} = 2z + 2\\lambda xyz = 0 \\)\n4. \\( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = xyz^2 - 2 = 0 \\)\n\n**Step 3: Solving the System**\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2, we have:\n\n- \\( 2x = -\\lambda yz^2 \\)\n- \\( 2y = -\\lambda xz^2 \\)\n\nDividing these gives:\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{y}{x} \\Rightarrow x^2 = y^2 \\Rightarrow y = \\pm x \\]\n\nLet's analyze both \\( y = x \\) and \\( y = -x \\).\n\n**Case 1: \\( y = x \\)**\n\n- Substitute into the constraint: \\( x \\cdot x \\cdot z^2 = 2 \\Rightarrow x^2z^2 = 2 \\).\n\nThis gives \\( z^2 = \\frac{2}{x^2} \\), so \\( z = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{|x|} \\).\n\nCalculate \\( D^2 \\):\n\n\\[ D^2 = x^2 + x^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{|x|}\\right)^2 = 2x^2 + \\frac{2}{x^2} \\]\n\nMinimize \\( D^2 \\). Let's set \\( u = x^2 \\), hence:\n\n\\[ D^2 = 2u + \\frac{2}{u} \\]\n\nFind the derivative and set it to zero:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{du}(2u + \\frac{2}{u}) = 2 - \\frac{2}{u^2} = 0 \\]\n\nSolving gives \\( u^2 = 1 \\), \\( x^2 = 1 \\). So, \\( x = \\pm 1 \\). \n\nGiven \\( x^2 = 1 \\), check:\n\n- \\( z^2 = \\frac{2}{1} = 2 \\Rightarrow z = \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n**Step 4: Reflect and Double-check**\n\nFor \\( x = 1, y = 1, z = \\sqrt{2} \\), verify:\n\n- \\( xyz^2 = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 2 \\), constraint satisfied.\n- Distance: \\( D = \\sqrt{1 + 1 + 2} = \\sqrt{4} = 2 \\).\n\nFor \\( x = -1, y = -1, z = \\sqrt{2} \\), verify similarly. Same \\( D = 2 \\).\n\n**Final Insight:**\n\nBoth checks show \\( D = 2 \\). Thus, the minimum distance from the curve to the origin is 2.\n\nReflect on this: We confirmed that by symmetry and constraint satisfaction every possible valid pair \\( (x,y,z) \\) through these calculations maintains \\( D = 2 \\). This appears consistent with what would universally apply via symmetry for analogous conditions.\n\nExploration via Lagrange multipliers was more efficient. Alternative substitution or symmetry reasoning reaffirm null additional insights.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe minimum distance from the origin to the curve \\( xyz^2 = 2 \\) is \\( \\boxed{2} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "We want to minimize $x^2 + y^2 + z^2.$  We know that $xyz^2 = 2.$  Note that flipping the sign of $z$ does not change $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ or $xyz^2,$ so we may assume that $z$ is positive.  Also, from the condition $xyz^2 = 2,$ both $x$ and $y$ are positive, or both are negative.  If they are both negative, we can flip the sign of both $x$ and $y.$  Thus, we may assume that $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are all positive.\n\nThen by AM-GM,\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 &= x^2 + y^2 + \\frac{z^2}{2} + \\frac{z^2}{2} \\\\\n&\\ge 4 \\sqrt[4]{x^2 \\cdot y^2 \\cdot \\frac{z^2}{2} \\cdot \\frac{z^2}{2}} \\\\\n&= 4 \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{x^2 y^2 z^4}{4}} \\\\\n&= 4 \\sqrt{\\frac{xyz^2}{2}} \\\\\n&= 4.\n\\end{align*}Hence, $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\ge 2.$\n\nEquality occurs when $x = y = \\frac{z}{\\sqrt{2}}.$  Along with the condition $xyz^2 = 2,$ we can solve to get $x = 1,$ $y = 1,$ and $z = \\sqrt{2}.$  Thus, the minimum distance is $\\boxed{2}.$"
