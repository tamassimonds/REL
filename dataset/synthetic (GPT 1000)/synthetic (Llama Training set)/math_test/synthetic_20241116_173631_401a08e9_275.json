    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem by approaching it step by step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Brainstorming\nWhen I first look at this problem, it deals with inequalities and fractions. We want \\( \\frac{3}{x} \\) to be greater than \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) and less than \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\nHmm, this reminds me of problems where we have to find a range of values for a variable given an inequality. This could be similar to what I did in algebra before, where I worked with inequalities and fractions.\n\nFirst, my instinct is to separate these inequalities into two parts:\n1. \\(\\frac{3}{x} > \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{3}{x} < \\frac{3}{4}\\)\n\nLet's tackle each part separately.\n\n### Solving the First Inequality: \\(\\frac{3}{x} > \\frac{1}{3}\\)\nFor this part, my thought is to multiply both sides by \\(x\\) to eliminate the fraction. But hold on, \\(x\\) could be negative or positive, which affects the inequality sign. So, I should consider the cases where \\(x > 0\\) and \\(x < 0\\) separately.\n\n#### Case 1: \\(x > 0\\)\nIf \\(x > 0\\), we can multiply both sides by \\(x\\) without changing the inequality direction:\n\\[ 3 > \\frac{x}{3} \\]\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\\[ 9 > x \\]\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[ x < 9 \\]\n\n#### Case 2: \\(x < 0\\)\nIf \\(x < 0\\), then we need to multiply both sides by \\(x\\) and the inequality changes direction:\n\\[ 3x < x \\]\nWait, I made a mistake here. This doesn't make sense. I need to be more careful because multiplying by a negative number changes the inequality. Let's correct this:\n\nActually, since \\(x < 0\\) means \\(\\frac{3}{x}\\) would be negative, which will never be greater than \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), we should not consider \\(x < 0\\) for this inequality. That simplifies things.\n\nSo for \\(x > 0\\), our condition is \\(x < 9\\).\n\n### Solving the Second Inequality: \\(\\frac{3}{x} < \\frac{3}{4}\\)\nAgain, I'll tackle cases separately.\n\n#### Case 1: \\(x > 0\\)\nMultiply both sides by \\(x\\):\n\\[ 3 < \\frac{3x}{4} \\]\nMultiply by 4 to clear the fraction:\n\\[ 12 < 3x \\]\nSimplify by dividing by 3:\n\\[ 4 < x \\]\nSo, \\(x > 4\\).\n\n#### Case 2: \\(x < 0\\)\nFor \\(x < 0\\), similar to before, multiplying by a negative \\(x\\) would change the inequality sign, but \\(\\frac{3}{x}\\) would be negative, which makes it impossible to be less than a positive \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\). Therefore, we do not consider \\(x < 0\\).\n\n### Combining the Results\nNow, for \\(x > 0\\), we have two conditions:\n1. \\(x < 9\\)\n2. \\(x > 4\\)\n\nCombining these, we have:\n\\[ 4 < x < 9 \\]\n\n### Finding Integer Solutions\nLet's list all integer values of \\(x\\) that satisfy \\(4 < x < 9\\):\n- \\(x = 5, 6, 7, 8\\)\n\nTo find the sum:\n\\[ 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26 \\]\n\n### Double-Check\nLet's double-check quickly:\n- Check \\(x = 5\\): \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) is between \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n- Check \\(x = 8\\): \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) is between \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\nEverything seems consistent.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe sum of all integer values of \\(x\\) such that \\(\\frac{3}{x}\\) is greater than \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) and less than \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We are asked to sum the integer solutions of the inequality  \\[\n\\frac{1}{3}<\\frac{3}{x}<\\frac{3}{4}.\n\\] If both sides of an inequality represent positive numbers, then we may take the reciprocal of both sides of the inequality and reverse the inequality sign. We can do that in this case, because all solutions of the original inequalities are clearly positive. Reciprocating all three quantities in this compound inequality, we get \\[\n3>\\frac{x}{3}>\\frac{4}{3}.\n\\] Now multiply both sides by $3$ to find that $4<x<9$.  The sum of the integer values of $x$ which satisfy this inequality is $5+6+7+8=\\boxed{26}$."
