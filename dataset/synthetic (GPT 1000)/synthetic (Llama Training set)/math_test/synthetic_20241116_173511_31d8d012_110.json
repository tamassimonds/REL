    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and expand the expression \\((x+3)(2x-4)(x-6)\\). Here's how my thought process unfolds:\n\n### Brainstorming at First Glance\n\n1. **Initial Reaction**: At first glance, this looks like a straightforward polynomial expansion problem. It reminds me of the standard process of expanding products of binomials. But there's an extra factor here, making it a bit more complex. \n\n2. **Approaches Considered**: \n   - The standard approach I would use here is to first multiply two of the binomials, and then multiply the result by the third one.\n   - We could also try the distributive method directly across all three, but that might get messy without a clear intermediary step.\n\n3. **Choosing an Approach**: I think multiplying two of the binomials first, then handling the third is a more organized way to tackle this. This approach helped me handle similar problems before, so it\u2019s likely to work here too.\n\n### Step-by-step Process\n\n**Step 1: Multiply the First Two Binomials**\n\n- Consider \\((x+3)(2x-4)\\). Let's expand this:\n\n\\[\nx(2x) + x(-4) + 3(2x) + 3(-4)\n\\]\n\n- So we get:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 4x + 6x - 12 \n\\]\n\n- Combine like terms:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 + 2x - 12\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: That seems reasonable. The terms are lining up correctly. I\u2019ll check the arithmetic again to be sure. Yes, it looks fine.\n\n**Step 2: Multiply the Result by the Third Binomial**\n\n- Now, take the result \\(2x^2 + 2x - 12\\) and multiply it by \\(x-6\\):\n\n- Distribute each term in the quadratic across each term in the binomial:\n\n  - \\(2x^2(x)\\) = \\(2x^3\\)\n  - \\(2x^2(-6)\\) = \\(-12x^2\\)\n  - \\(2x(x)\\) = \\(2x^2\\)\n  - \\(2x(-6)\\) = \\(-12x\\)\n  - \\(-12(x)\\) = \\(-12x\\)\n  - \\(-12(-6)\\) = \\(72\\)\n\n- Combine the results:\n\n\\[\n2x^3 - 12x^2 + 2x^2 - 12x - 12x + 72\n\\]\n\n- Simplify by combining like terms:\n\n\\[\n2x^3 + (-12x^2 + 2x^2) + (-12x - 12x) + 72 = 2x^3 - 10x^2 - 24x + 72\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: This looks correct. I\u2019ve accounted for each term systematically, and the arithmetic seems sound.\n\n### Final Aha Moment\n\nAfter checking my work, everything seems consistent. Each step follows logically from the others. The distributive property was correctly applied, and combining like terms went smoothly.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nSo, the expanded expression is:\n\n\\[\n2x^3 - 10x^2 - 24x + 72\n\\]\n\nThis process felt good, I made sure to verify each step as I went along. Reflecting on it, the approach and calculations make sense, and it aligns well with standard algebraic methods.",
