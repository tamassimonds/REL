    "working_out": "Alright, let's take this problem step by step. I'm going to begin by understanding the problem and the operations we need to perform.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Operations\nFirst, let's focus on what these operations mean. We have two operations defined here:\n- $\\&x = x + 5$: This means whenever we see $\\&x$, we add 5 to $x$.\n- $\\#x = x^2$: This indicates that $\\#x$ means to square $x$.\n\n### Step 2: What is Being Asked?\nThe problem asks us to find the value of $\\#(\\&4)$. At first glance, this expression seems a little complicated, but if we break it down step by step, it should become clearer.\n\n### Step 3: Break Down the Expression $\\#(\\&4)$\nA good way to tackle this is to evaluate the innermost operation first. In this case, that's $\\&4$. \n\n1. **Evaluate $\\&4$:**\n   - According to the operation $\\&x = x + 5$, replace $x$ with $4$, so $\\&4 = 4 + 5$.\n   - This results in: $\\&4 = 9$.\n\nOkay, we're making progress. Now we know that $\\#(\\&4)$ is actually the same as $\\#9$.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate $\\#9$\nNow we will apply the second operation:\n\n2. **Evaluate $\\#9$:**\n   - According to the operation $\\#x = x^2$, replace $x$ with $9$, so $\\#9 = 9^2$.\n   - Calculating this gives: $\\#9 = 81$.\n\n### Step 5: Check the Work\nLet's quickly go over what we did to ensure everything's correct:\n- For $\\&4$, we calculated $4 + 5 = 9$. \u2714\ufe0f\n- For $\\#9$, we calculated $9^2 = 81$. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThis all looks correct. The operations were applied properly based on their definitions, and the arithmetic checks out.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe final answer to the problem, $\\#(\\&4)$, is **81**.\n\nI'm confident about this solution. It follows logically step by step, and each operation was applied correctly.",
