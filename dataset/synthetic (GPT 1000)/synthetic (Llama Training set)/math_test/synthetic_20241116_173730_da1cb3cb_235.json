    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, we're asked to find the value of \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{(3!)!}{3!}\\).\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- My initial thought is that this seems to involve factorials, which are functions often used in permutations and combinations.\n- Factorials grow quickly, so we might end up working with large numbers.\n- I've seen similar problems where we substitute values into the expression before computing anything. Let\u2019s try that approach.\n\nStep-by-Step Exploration:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Expression**:\n    - What does \\(3!\\) mean? A factorial \\(!\\) means a number is multiplied by every positive integer less than itself: \\(3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\).\n    - Calculate \\(3!\\): \n\n      \\[\n      3! = 6\n      \\]\n\n    - Our initial expression now looks like \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{(6)!}{3!}\\).\n\n2. **Substitute Back into the Expression**:\n    - Next, substitute \\(3!\\) into the fraction, which gives us:\n\n      \\[\n      \\frac{6!}{3!}\n      \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\(6!\\) and \\(3!\\)**:\n    - Calculate \\(6!\\) to understand the numerator:\n\n      \\[\n      6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720\n      \\]\n\n    - Confirm \\(3!\\) again in the denominator:\n\n      \\[\n      3! = 6\n      \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n    - Now, compute the division \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{720}{6}\\).\n\n      \\[\n      \\frac{720}{6} = 120\n      \\]\n\n5. **Reflect and Check**: \n    - Does the computation make sense? Each step should logically follow from the previous.\n    - Think through whether any simplifications or substitutions were mishandled. It seems straightforward as factorials simply calculate products.\n    - Verify intermediate results, such as recalculating \\(6!\\) and \\(720 / 6\\).\n    \n      - \\(6! = 720\\)\n      - \\(720 / 6 = 120\\)\n\n   - No arithmetic errors appear upon re-checking.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n    - The final value of the original expression is \\( \\boxed{120} \\).\n   \nThe problem itself is a straightforward calculation once properly substituted and requires mindfulness of factorial growth. Let\u2019s cement that the approach logically holds firm given various checks\u2014\\(\\frac{(n!)!}{n!}\\) forms of expression should naturally factor through with consistency in the calculation steps.\n\nMy approach evolved by first understanding the factorial evaluation was essential and then naturally moving through arithmetic steps. This affirms that the calculated value of \\(\\boxed{120}\\) aligns consistently with conventional factorial operations and confirms the problem was tackled methodically with consideration.",
