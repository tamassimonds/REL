    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\nOkay, I'm looking at a probability problem involving committee selections. I remember problems like these often involving combinations because we're dealing with groups chosen from a larger set without regard to order. But let me think this through carefully because there are specific conditions about the kind of subcommittee we're forming: one Republican, one Democrat, and one Independent. My brain is suggesting using combinations, but let\u2019s explore some options first... \n\nBrainstorming: \n\nHmm, so there are a few strategies I can consider:\n1. Calculate the total number of ways to form any subcommittee of 3 members from the entire committee, then find the number of favorable ways (1 Rep, 1 Dem, 1 Ind) and find the probability. \n2. Count the favorable cases directly and compare this with the total cases. \n3. Consider probability rules directly, like multiplying the probabilities of choosing each member in order, but that might get complicated... \n\nI think I should try both the total-combinations approach and then directly count the favorable cases. The combined methods might help confirm my solution. \n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n**1. Calculate Total Number of Ways to Select a Subcommittee:**\n- Total members = 5 Republicans + 6 Democrats + 2 Independents = 13 members\n- I need to choose 3 members out of 13. \n- This seems like I should use combinations since order doesn't matter.\n\nFormula: \\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\nSo, \\[ C(13, 3) = \\frac{13!}{3!(13-3)!} = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} \\]\n\nLet me calculate this: \n- \\( 13 \\times 12 = 156 \\)\n- \\( 156 \\times 11 = 1716 \\)\n- Now divide by \\( 6 \\) (which is \\( 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\)): \n\n\\[ 1716 / 6 = 286 \\]\n\nThe total number of ways to choose any 3 members from 13 is \\( 286 \\). \n\n**2. Calculate Favorable Number of Ways to Select 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, 1 Independent:**\n\n- Choose 1 Republican from 5 Republicans. \n\\[ C(5, 1) = 5 \\]\n- Choose 1 Democrat from 6 Democrats. \n\\[ C(6, 1) = 6 \\]\n- Choose 1 Independent from 2 Independents. \n\\[ C(2, 1) = 2 \\]\n\nNow multiply these combinations because each choice is independent:\n\nFavorable ways = \\( 5 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 60 \\).\n\n**3. Calculate Probability:**\n\nProbability \\( P \\) that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is: \n\n\\[ P = \\frac{\\text{Favorable ways}}{\\text{Total ways}} = \\frac{60}{286} \\]\n\nLet me compute this probability: \nSimplifying \\(\\frac{60}{286}\\)... \n\nHmm, let me try factoring: \n- The GCD here seems to be 2 (since both are even numbers), let's check:\n\n- \\( 60 \\div 2 = 30 \\)\n- \\( 286 \\div 2 = 143 \\)\n\nSo, simplified: \n\\[ \\frac{30}{143} \\]\n\nThat should be it. Let me reflect and check quickly if this makes sense by rounding... \n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems right. I checked the ingredients of my process and they align with combination logic and probability calculations. This feeling matches my initial intuition and the steps were coherent. But let me pause and quickly review whether fractions are ideal: given the setup, fractions might not simplify further without calculation errors, but I'll stop here. \n\nYeah, this seems correct. \\(\\frac{30}{143}\\) is the probability the subcommittee will consist of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent.",

  "ground_truth": "There are 5 ways to choose a Republican, 6 ways to choose a Democrat, and 2 ways to choose an Independent for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 60$ different subcommittees of a Republican, Democrat, and Independent.   There are $\\binom{13}{3} = \\dfrac{13\\cdot12\\cdot 11}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1} = 286$ ways to choose 3 people from 13 to form a committee, so there are 286 possible committees. Therefore, the probability that the subcommittee is made up of a Republican, Democrat, and Independent is $\\dfrac{60}{286} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{30}{143}}$ ."
