    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem step by step. \n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nLooking at the problem, it feels familiar because it's about forming an expression based on given conditions. We know the costs of items (pencils and erasers) are variables, and the number of items bought is partly known. I'm thinking this boils down to forming an expression representing a total cost. \n\n**Understanding the Problem:**  \nWe need to find the total expenditure based on the number of pencils and erasers Mark buys. We know:\n- A pencil costs \\( p \\) dollars.\n- An eraser costs \\( e \\) dollars.\n- Mark buys 7 pencils.\n- He buys 3 more pencils than erasers.\n\nThe key information here is how the number of pencils and erasers relate: 7 pencils mean he bought 4 erasers (since he's buying 3 more pencils than erasers).\n\n**Strategizing a Solution:**  \nI think a systematic approach is to:\n1. Express the total purchase of pencils and erasers in terms of their quantities and prices.\n2. Use the information given to eliminate or express relationships between those quantities and costs.\n\n**Step-by-Step:**\n\n1. **Express Number of Erasers:**  \n   If Mark buys 7 pencils, and this is 3 more than the erasers, the number of erasers is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of erasers} = 7 - 3 = 4\n   \\]\n   This agrees with the logic, as subtracting 3 from the pencils gives us 4.\n\n2. **Cost of Pencils:**  \n   Since each pencil costs \\( p \\) dollars, the total cost for 7 pencils is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of pencils} = 7p\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of Erasers:**  \n   Similarly, with each eraser costing \\( e \\) dollars, and knowing he buys 4, the cost is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of erasers} = 4e\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Cost:**  \n   Combine these to form the total cost expression:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost} = 7p + 4e\n   \\]\n\n**Reflecting on the Solution:**  \nIt makes sense because it accounts for the number of each item bought multiplied by their respective costs. I'm confident this is correct, as it checks out logically with the problem's conditions.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIs 7 pencils being 3 more than 4 erasers valid? Yes. And, the arithmetic here for determining costs and numbers seems consistent with standard mathematical procedures used in forming expressions.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nThis approach captures all relevant aspects while ensuring that the expression directly reflects what the problem described. I\u2019m happy with this solution, and it\u2019s simple and adheres to the problem's relationships among variables.\n\nSo, the expression representing Mark's total expenditure is \\( 7p + 4e \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Mark buys $7$ pencils, and a pencil costs $p$ dollars, so the total cost of all of the pencils is $7\\cdot p$ dollars. He buys $3$ more pencils than erasers, so he buys $4$ erasers. Each eraser costs $e$ dollars, so the total cost of all the erasers is $4\\cdot e$ dollars. Thus, Mark spent $\\boxed{7p+4e}$ dollars in total."
