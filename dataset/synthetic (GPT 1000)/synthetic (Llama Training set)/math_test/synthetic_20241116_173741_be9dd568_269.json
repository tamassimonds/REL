    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem. We have two squares, \\(ABGH\\) and \\(BCDF\\), sharing a common side \\(BC\\). They are coplanar and adjacent. The sides of square \\(BCDF\\) and \\(ABGH\\) are \\(CD = 10\\) and \\(AH = 5\\), respectively. Point \\(E\\) lies on segments \\(AD\\) and \\(GB\\).\n\n### Initial Impressions\n- The problem asks us to find the area of triangle \\(ABE\\).\n- Area of a triangle is calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\). So, identifying the base and height or another method to find the area is crucial.\n- The problem involves coplanar figures, which immediately makes me think about geometry of them and how they fit together.\n- \\(CD\\) being 10 units suggests that square \\(BCDF\\) is larger than square \\(ABGH\\) which has side \\(AH = 5\\).\n\n### Exploring the Geometry\n1. **Coordinates Setup**: \n   - Let's assign coordinates to make visualization easier. \n   - Let \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (5, 0)\\), \\(G = (5, 5)\\), and \\(H = (0, 5)\\) for square \\(ABGH\\).\n   - For square \\(BCDF\\), \\(C = (15, 0)\\), \\(D = (15, 10)\\), \\(F = (5, 10)\\).\n\n2. **Position of \\(E\\)**:\n   - \\(E\\) is on segments \\(AD\\) and \\(GB\\). \n   - \\(AD\\) is the vertical line from \\(A\\) to \\(D\\), which means \\(x = 0\\).\n   - \\(GB\\) lies on the horizontal line through \\(B, G\\), which has the equation \\(y = 0\\).\n   - The point \\(E\\) therefore has to satisfy both conditions.\n\n3. **Using Geometry to Find \\(E\\)**:\n   - Since \\(E\\) is on line \\(AD\\), its coordinate would be of the form \\((0, y)\\).\n   - Simultaneously being on line \\(GB\\), which is horizontal, suggests some overlapping of conditions.\n   - However, I realize I've confused the conditions initially. I need to actually use segments \\(AD\\) and \\(GB\\) in their true forms by using vectors or geometry more appropriately.\n\n4. **Using Midpoint Concept from Segments**:\n   - There's a diagonal \\(AD\\) which intersects segment \\(GB\\). Finding the intersection will be key.\n\n5. **Equations for Lines \\(AD\\) and \\(GB\\)**:\n   - Vector for \\(AD\\) stretches from \\(A(0,0)\\) to \\(D(15,10)\\), so its parametric form is \\( (x, y) = t(15, 10) = (15t, 10t) \\).\n   - For segment \\(GB\\), the vector starts at \\(G(5,5)\\) to \\(B(5,0)\\). The movement is vertical only: \\( (x, y) = (5, 5 - s\\cdot 5)\\).\n\n6. **Finding Intersection \\(E\\)**:\n   - Since both travel in the segment, coordinate of \\(E\\) is determined by finding common intersect between these two lines.\n   - Setting the x\u2019s equal, \\(15t = 5\\) gives \\(t = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n   - Setting y\u2019s equal: \\(10t = 5 - 5s\\); substituting \\(t = \\frac{1}{3}\\) this becomes \\(\\frac{10}{3} = 5 - 5s\\), leading to \\(s = \\frac{5}{6}\\).\n   - This confirms the \\(x\\)-coordinate of \\(E\\) as \\(5\\) and \\(y\\)-coordinate as \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\).\n\n7. **Area of \\(\\triangle ABE\\)**:\n   - Coordinates of points: \\(A(0,0)\\), \\(B(5,0)\\), and \\(E(5, \\frac{10}{3})\\).\n   - Using the formula \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} | x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) |\\).\n   - \\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} | 0(0 - \\frac{10}{3}) + 5(\\frac{10}{3} - 0) + 5(0 - 0) | = \\frac{1}{2} \\times |0 + \\frac{50}{3} + 0| = \\frac{25}{3}. \\]\n\n### Final Check and Conclusion\n- The calculations seem consistent with logical expectation given setup in coordinate formulation.\n- Revisited setup, intersections, and applied guard methods check kung hindi nagkakamali sa alignment.\n- The answer for the area of triangle \\(ABE\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{25}{3}}\\) square units.",

  "ground_truth": "The area of triangle $ACD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(AC)(DC) = \\frac{1}{2}(5+10)(10) = 75$. Triangle $ABE$ is similar to triangle $ACD$, with ratio of similitude $AB/AC = 5/15 = 1/3$. So the ratio of their areas is $(1/3)^2 = 1/9$, so the area of $ABE$ is $(1/9)(75) = \\boxed{\\frac{25}{3}}$."
