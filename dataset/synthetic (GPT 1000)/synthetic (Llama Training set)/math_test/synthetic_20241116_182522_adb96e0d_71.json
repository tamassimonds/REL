    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think it through step by step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- I'm given the equation involving a complex number \\( z \\) and its conjugate \\( \\bar{z} \\), which is \\( 3z + 4i\\bar{z} = 1 - 8i \\).\n- This equation seems to involve both \\( z \\) and its conjugate, which suggests it might get a bit tricky.\n- I remember that for a complex number \\( z = a + bi \\), its conjugate is \\( \\bar{z} = a - bi \\).\n- So perhaps a good starting point is to express \\( z \\) as \\( z = a + bi \\).\n\n### Setting Up:\n- Let's substitute \\( z = a + bi \\) into the equation. This substitution might help me express \\( \\bar{z} \\).\n\n### Substitution:\n- If \\( z = a + bi \\), then \\( \\bar{z} = a - bi \\).\n- Substituting these into the equation gives:\n  \\[\n  3(a + bi) + 4i(a - bi) = 1 - 8i\n  \\]\n\n### Simplifying:\n- Let's distribute on both sides:\n  \\[\n  3a + 3bi + 4ia - 4bi^2 = 1 - 8i\n  \\]\n- Recall that \\( i^2 = -1 \\), so the term \\(-4bi^2\\) becomes \\(4b\\).\n\n### Combining Real and Imaginary Parts:\n- Collect the real and imaginary parts:\n  \\[\n  (3a + 4b) + (3b + 4a)i = 1 - 8i\n  \\]\n- Now I have two separate equations by equating real parts and imaginary parts:\n  1. \\( 3a + 4b = 1 \\)\n  2. \\( 3b + 4a = -8 \\)\n\n### Solving the System:\n- I've got a system of linear equations. Let me solve it:\n\n1. **Equation 1**: \\( 3a + 4b = 1 \\)\n2. **Equation 2**: \\( 4a + 3b = -8 \\)\n\n- Hmm, a couple of ways to solve this. Substitution seems feasible, but I feel like elimination might be quicker. Let's try eliminating one variable.\n\n- I can multiply Equation 1 by 3 and Equation 2 by 4 to align the coefficients of \\( a \\):\n\n  \\[\n  9a + 12b = 3 \\quad \\text{(from Equation 1)}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  16a + 12b = -32 \\quad \\text{(from Equation 2)}\n  \\]\n\n### Eliminate \\( b \\):\n- Subtract the first modified equation from the second:\n  \\[\n  (16a + 12b) - (9a + 12b) = -32 - 3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  7a = -35\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a = -5\n  \\]\n\n### Finding \\( b \\):\n- Now substitute \\( a = -5 \\) back into Equation 1:\n  \\[\n  3(-5) + 4b = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -15 + 4b = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  4b = 16\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  b = 4\n  \\]\n\n### Solution:\n- So now I have \\( a = -5 \\) and \\( b = 4 \\). Substituting back into my expression for \\( z \\), I find:\n  \\[\n  z = a + bi = -5 + 4i\n  \\]\n\n### Check:\n- Let's make sure this solution satisfies the original equation. First, calculate \\( \\bar{z} \\):\n  \\[\n  \\bar{z} = -5 - 4i\n  \\]\n\n- Substitute back into the original equation \\( 3z + 4i\\bar{z} = 1 - 8i \\):\n  \\[\n  3(-5 + 4i) + 4i(-5 - 4i)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (-15 + 12i) + (-20i - 16i^2)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (-15 + 12i) + (-20i + 16) \\quad \\text{(since \\(i^2 = -1\\))}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  1 - 8i\n  \\]\n- It checks out!\n\nThis problem-solving process reaffirms everything seems correct. The complex number \\( z \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( \\boxed{-5 + 4i} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Let $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of $z$, respectively.  Then $\\bar{z}=a-bi$, so that $4i\\bar{z}=4b+4ia$.  We now find that \\[ 3z+4i\\bar{z} = (3a+4b) + (4a+3b)i. \\]So if $3z+4i\\bar{z}=1-8i$ then we must have $3a+4b=1$ and $4a+3b=-8$.  This system of equations is routine to solve, leading to the values $a=-5$ and $b=4$.  Therefore the complex number we are seeking is $z=\\boxed{-5+4i}$."
