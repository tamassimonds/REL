    "working_out": "### Starting Off: Understanding the Problem\n\nAlright, let's break this down from the start. We have the number 2001, and each digit is on a different card. The numbers on the cards are 2, 0, 0, and 1. We need to select three cards such that the product of the numbers on the cards is not zero.\n\nHmm. Okay, this problem definitely revolves around the zero digits. If the product shouldn't be zero, then none of the selected cards can have a zero. Thus, any combination that includes a zero would need to be avoided. My first thought is: how many non-zero digits do I actually have? Let's think it through.\n\n### Considering the Non-Zero Digits\n\n- We have: 2, 0, 0, 1.\n- The non-zero digits are 2 and 1.\n\nWait a minute...there are only two non-zero digits: 2 and 1. That means to ensure the product isn't zero, I need to resolve how this fits with selecting three digits \u2014 because I only have two non-zero digits and I need three cards.\n\n### Re-evaluating What's Possible \n\nOkay, I see the challenge. If there aren't enough non-zero digits to make a product that isn't zero with three different cards, that\u2019s saying something significant.\n\nThe realization: \n\nHere\u2019s a fundamental insight: I physically cannot select three cards without including at least one zero because I don\u2019t have enough non-zero numbers. There are only two non-zero digits, and we can't avoid choosing all three non-zero because that\u2019s impossible with two distinct non-zero digits.\n\n### Calculating Total Possibilities and Outcomes\n\n- Total different digit cards we have = 4 (from number 2001).\n- We need to select 3 out of these four.\n\nLet's calculate total selection ways:\n\n\\[ \\binom{4}{3} = 4 \\]\n\nBut what selections do we have?\n\n1. (2, 0, 0)\n2. (2, 0, 1)\n3. (0, 0, 1)\n4. (2, 0, 1)\n\nEach option includes at least one zero. On second thought \u2014 ah, of course: all options have at least one zero. Therefore, all these will cause a zero product and must be acknowledged in some way. \n\n### The Answer\n\nTo answer the original question: In how many ways can I choose three cards such that the product is not zero? \n\n- **Answer: 0 ways.**\n\nWhy? Because no selection of three cards exists wherein all chosen digits are non-zero.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI\u2019ve verified this several times and considered different combinations (none work without zero). So, there's no valid way to choose three cards from these particular digit options without resulting in at least one zero and thus, a zero product. \n\nThis was a good breakdown of understanding limitations imposed by zero on permissible product calculations. It's a helpful reminder that not every combination is feasible with constraints like \"product not zero\" when zeros are present.",
