    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nOkay, so we have a triangle with sides 7, 24, and 25. The problem asks for the sum of the lengths of the three altitudes, and we need to express this sum as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nImmediately, the side lengths make me think of a right triangle. Hmm, 7, 24, 25... Realizations are starting to click \u2013 this might be similar to the Pythagorean triple I know! If I'm correct, this should be a right triangle. Let's verify that.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Triangle Type\n\nFor a right triangle, \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). Let's see if this holds:\n\n- Calculate \\(7^2 + 24^2 = 49 + 576 = 625\\).\n- Calculate \\(25^2 = 625\\).\n\nWow, perfect! This is indeed a right triangle with 25 being the hypotenuse.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Area of the Triangle\n\nFor a moment, let\u2019s think about what we need to do next. Knowing it's a right triangle, the area can be easily calculated using the two legs (7 and 24) as base and height.\n\n- Area \\(A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 7 \\times 24 = 84\\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Altitudes\n\nNow we need to calculate the altitudes corresponding to each side. The formula for the altitude \\(h\\) from a side of length \\(a\\) is given by:\n\\[ h = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{Area}}{a} \\]\n\nLet\u2019s calculate each altitude:\n\n1. **Altitude to side 7:**\n   \\[ h_7 = \\frac{2 \\times 84}{7} = \\frac{168}{7} = 24 \\]\n\n2. **Altitude to side 24:**\n   \\[ h_{24} = \\frac{2 \\times 84}{24} = \\frac{168}{24} = 7 \\]\n\n3. **Altitude to side 25 (hypotenuse):**\n   \\[ h_{25} = \\frac{2 \\times 84}{25} = \\frac{168}{25} = 6.72 \\]\n\n   Calculation: \\(168 \\div 25 = 6.72\\). This feels like it makes sense given the other values.\n\n### Step 5: Sum of the Altitudes\n\nNext, let\u2019s sum these altitudes:\n\\[ \\text{Sum of altitudes} = 24 + 7 + 6.72 = 37.72 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Verify and Conclusion\n\nHmm, 37.72 seems to have a nice logical flow based on our steps:\n- The problem makes sense: I used consistent formulas for a right triangle.\n- The individual altitude values seem reasonable given the geometric nature of the figure.\n\nFinal result: The sum of the lengths of the altitudes is \\(\\boxed{37.72}\\).\n\nThis all has felt a bit like recalling something from past knowledge, and it checks out with the numbers. Wrapping this up, it seems correct from what I've calculated.",

  "ground_truth": "We recognize 7, 24, and 25 as a Pythagorean triple. That means the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 7 \\cdot 24 = 84.$ The altitudes are then easy to find: $\\frac{2 \\cdot 84}{7},$ $\\frac{2 \\cdot 84}{24},$ and $\\frac{2 \\cdot 84}{25}.$ Then, our answer is $\\frac{168}{7} + \\frac{168}{24} + \\frac{168}{25} = \\boxed{37.72}.$"
