    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem! We are dealing with triangle \\(\\triangle ABC\\) with point \\(K\\) on \\(\\overline{BC}\\) such that \\(AK\\) is an altitude. We know the length of \\(AK\\) and the segments \\(BK\\) and \\(CK\\). The problem asks us to find the perimeter of \\(\\triangle ABC\\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem.**\n\nFirst thoughts: Okay, so we have triangle geometry here. Summarizing what is given: \n- \\(AK = 6\\), which is the altitude.\n- The base \\(BC\\) is divided into segments \\(BK = 8\\) and \\(CK = 6\\).\n\nMy goal is to find the perimeter, which means I need the lengths of \\(\\overline{AB}\\), \\(\\overline{AC}\\), and \\(\\overline{BC}\\).\n\nWait a minute, \\(\\overline{BC} = BK + CK = 8 + 6 = 14\\).\n\nSo, the perimeter is \\(AB + AC + 14\\). I need to find \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\).\n\n**Step 2: Think about the triangle properties.**\n\nSince \\(AK\\) is an altitude, it forms right angles with \\(\\overline{BC}\\). So, we have two right triangles: \\(\\triangle ABK\\) and \\(\\triangle ACK\\). Using the Pythagorean theorem seems like a viable strategy because it deals with right triangle sides.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem.**\n\nFor \\(\\triangle ABK\\):\n\n\\[\nAB^2 = AK^2 + BK^2\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n\\[\nAB^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100\n\\]\n\nSo, \n\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n\\]\n\nThat seems right. Let me reflect: \\(AB = 10\\) seems logical since a Pythagorean triple here is \\(6, 8, 10\\).\n\nNow for \\(\\triangle ACK\\):\n\n\\[\nAC^2 = AK^2 + CK^2\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n\\[\nAC^2 = 6^2 + 6^2 = 36 + 36 = 72\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\nAC = \\sqrt{72}\n\\]\n\nHmm, let me simplify \\(\\sqrt{72}\\).\n\n\\[\nAC = \\sqrt{36 \\times 2} = \\sqrt{36}\\times\\sqrt{2} = 6\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Perimeter.**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = AB + AC + BC = 10 + 6\\sqrt{2} + 14\n\\]\n\nQuick check: Let's revisit the components we've found. \\(\\overline{BC} = 14\\), \\(\\overline{AB} = 10\\), \\(\\overline{AC} = 6\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nHmm, should I approximate it numerically for clarity? \\(\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414\\).\n\nSo, \n\n\\[\n6\\sqrt{2} \\approx 6 \\times 1.414 = 8.484\n\\]\n\nThus, \n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} \\approx 10 + 8.484 + 14 = 32.484\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe exact perimeter of the triangle is \\(24 + 6\\sqrt{2}\\), but approximated numerically, it\u2019s about 32.484.\n\nFeels solid, and the approach using Pythagorean identities checks out.
