Let's think through it explicitly:\n- Multiplying zero by itself any number of times (as indicated by the power) still gives zero.\n- So \\(0^5 = 0 \\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Any consecutive multiplication of 0 will always yield 0. This confirms our calculation.\n\n**Term 2: \\((-1)^4\\)**\n- This one involves a negative base with an even exponent. I need to analyze how signs work with powers:\n- The number (-1) multiplied by itself:\n  - Each multiplication alternates the sign. Essentially, pairs of negative numbers become positive because:\n    \\((-1) \\times (-1) = 1\\) and \\((1) \\times (-1) \\times (-1) = 1\\).\n- Since the exponent is even (4 is even), \\((-1)^4\\) should be positive.\n- Let's calculate: \\((-1) \\times (-1) \\times (-1) \\times (-1) = 1\\).\n- Therefore, \\((-1)^4 = 1\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Thinking through it once more: With an even number of negative multiplications, the negatives cancel out, confirming that the result is positive 1.\n\n### Step 3: Add the Results\nNow that I have calculated both terms, I should add them together:\n- \\(0^5 = 0\\)\n- \\((-1)^4 = 1\\)\n\nSo the addition \\(0^5 + (-1)^4 = 0 + 1\\).\n\n### Final Calculation\n- Final result of the expression is \\(0 + 1 = 1\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nEverything seems good. Stepping back for a moment, I've confirmed that each term was calculated correctly and that the logic of the powers held up according to mathematical rules. \nBy reconsidering the problem and each intermediate step, I've validated that the final answer, \\(1\\), makes sense, based on the mathematical principles related to powers and addition. \n\nI've reached the answer by verifying and cross-referencing standard rules of exponentiation. Looks like we're set, no changes needed!",

  "ground_truth": "Recall that 0 to any positive power is 0. Also recall that $(-a)^n=a^n$ if $n$ is even. Because 5 is positive and 4 is even, we can apply these rules to the given expression to get \\[0^5+(-1)^4=0+1^4=0+1=\\boxed{1}.\\]"
