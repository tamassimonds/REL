    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem:\nFirst, I need to determine what the problem is asking. The problem wants to know the remainder when the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is divided by 9. This seems straightforward, but let's see how we can break it down methodically.\n\n### Initial Ideas:\n- This looks a bit like those problems where we use formulas for arithmetic series, but I only have ten terms, so maybe I can handle this without a formula.\n- Alternatively, maybe there's some trick I'm forgetting about mod 9? Sometimes there's a pattern when dealing with numbers mod certain bases.\n\n### Strategy 1: Direct Calculation\nMy first instinct is to just add the numbers 1 through 10 and then see what happens when I divide by 9.\n\n- The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is:\n  \\[\n  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10\n  \\]\n\nLet me calculate this sum quickly:\n- First, I can pair the numbers (1 with 10, 2 with 9, etc.) to make my work a bit lighter. It becomes:\n  \\[\n  (1 + 10) + (2 + 9) + (3 + 8) + (4 + 7) + (5 + 6) = 11 + 11 + 11 + 11 + 11 = 55\n  \\]\n\nThe sum is 55. Now, I need to find the remainder of 55 divided by 9.\n- 55 divided by 9 is: \n  \\( 55 \\div 9 \\approx 6 \\) remainder 1 because \\( 9 \\times 6 = 54 \\) and \\( 55 - 54 = 1 \\).\n\n### Checking the Calculation:\nLet's verify the calculations to ensure they're correct.\n\n1. **Sum Verification:**\n   - Calculate iteratively if needed: \n     - \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n     - \\( 3 + 3 = 6 \\)\n     - \\( 6 + 4 = 10 \\)\n     - \\( 10 + 5 = 15 \\)\n     - \\( 15 + 6 = 21 \\)\n     - \\( 21 + 7 = 28 \\)\n     - \\( 28 + 8 = 36 \\)\n     - \\( 36 + 9 = 45 \\)\n     - \\( 45 + 10 = 55 \\)\n\n   Yes, verified. Sum is still 55.\n\n2. **Remainder Verification:**\n   - Divide 55 by 9:\n     - \\( 9 \\times 6 = 54 \\)\n     - \\( 55 - 54 = 1 \\)\n\n   Seems consistent, remainder is indeed 1.\n\n### Final Thoughts:\nThe calculation checks out, and the remainder is 1 without any complications. This is nice because it shows that even a direct approach can be efficient if executed carefully.\n\n### Insightful Note:\nJust a side note\u2014sometimes problems like these encourage us to look for patterns, especially with dividing by 9, possibly related to the sum of digits. However, for this small range, a direct calculation seems straightforward and effective.\n\nHere's the final answer: The remainder when the sum \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 10 \\) is divided by 9 is **1**.",

  "ground_truth": "Looking at our sum, we can see that the numbers $1$ through $8$ can be paired off to form $9,$ so we may eliminate them. That is, $1 + 8 = 2 + 7 = 3 + 6 = 4 + 5 = 9.$ Therefore, the only remaining terms are $9$ and $10,$ and $9$ is obviously also divisible by $9,$ hence we only need to find the remainder of $10$ when divided by $9,$ which is $\\boxed{1}.$"
