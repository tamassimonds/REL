  "problem": "On my ping-pong team there are four times as many right-handed boys as left-handed boys.  Of the students on the team who are left-handed, there are twice as many girls as there are boys.  Half of the girls who are on the team are left-handed.  If there are 36 people on the team, how many are right-handed boys? (Assume no player plays ping-pong equally well with both hands.)",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. It seems like a classic algebraic word problem involving ratios and relationships among groups of people, specifically a ping-pong team. Let's think aloud and work through it together, deciphering the data and breaking it down systematically.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Determine What You Know:**\n   - There are four times as many right-handed boys as left-handed boys.\n   - Of the left-handed people, there are twice as many girls as boys.\n   - Half of the girls on the team are left-handed.\n   - The team comprises 36 people.\n\n2. **Identify What Is Being Asked:**\n   - How many right-handed boys are there on the team?\n\n### Brainstorming and Strategy\n\nHmm, I'm thinking this involves setting up some equations based on the given relationships. There's definitely a need to keep track of the different groups mentioned: right-handed boys, left-handed boys, left-handed girls, and all girls.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( L_b \\) = Number of left-handed boys\n- \\( L_g \\) = Number of left-handed girls\n- \\( R_b \\) = Number of right-handed boys\n- \\( G \\) = Total number of girls on the team\n\nGiven:\n- **Four times as many right-handed boys as left-handed boys:** \\( R_b = 4L_b \\)\n- **Twice as many left-handed girls as boys:** \\( L_g = 2L_b \\)\n- **Half of the girls are left-handed:** \\( L_g = \\frac{1}{2}G \\)\n- **Total number of people:** \\( L_b + L_g + R_b + (G - L_g) = 36 \\)\n\n### Setting Up the Equations\n\nLet's take these insights and form our equations:\n\n1. \\( R_b = 4L_b \\) (for right-handed boys)\n2. \\( L_g = 2L_b \\) (for the proportion of left-handed girls among left-handed people)\n3. \\( L_g = \\frac{1}{2}G \\) (half of all girls are left-handed)\n4. Considering everyone, we have:\\( L_b + L_g + R_b + (G - L_g) = 36 \\)\n\nWait, maybe let's simplify this visually:\n\n- \\( L_b \\) = Left-handed boys\n- \\( L_g = 2L_b \\)\n- \\( R_b = 4L_b \\)\n- \\( G = \\frac{1}{2}L_g + L_g = 2L_g \\)\n\n### Solving Step-by-step\n\nFirst, plug in \\( L_g \\) from its definition:\n\n\\[ \nL_g = 2L_b \n\\]\n\nSo, from the third equation \\( L_g = \\frac{1}{2}G \\):\n\n\\[\n2L_b = \\frac{1}{2}G \\implies G = 4L_b \n\\]\n\nSubstitute into the total people equation:\n\n\\[ \nL_b + 2L_b + 4L_b + (4L_b - 2L_b) = 36 \n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ \nL_b + 2L_b + 4L_b + 2L_b = 36 \n\\]\n\n\\[ \n9L_b = 36 \n\\]\n\nSo, \\( L_b = 4 \\).\n\n### Calculation of Right-handed Boys\n\nFinally, calculate \\( R_b \\):\n\nSince \\( R_b = 4L_b \\):\n\n\\[ \nR_b = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \n\\]\n\n### Double Checking\n\nCheck the teams breakdown:\n- Left-handed boys \\( L_b = 4 \\)\n- Left-handed girls \\( L_g = 8 \\) (since \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\))\n- Right-handed boys \\( R_b = 16 \\)\n- Total girls \\( G = 16 \\) (since \\( 8 \\) left-handed + \\( 8 \\) right-handed girls)\n\nSum up everyone:\n\\[ 4 (L_b) + 8 (L_g) + 16 (R_b) + 8 (right-handed girls) = 36 \\]\n\nEverything checks out! Our final count of right-handed boys is indeed 16. \n\n- Great! The answer agrees with what the problem is asking, and reflection makes this seem like a solid, comprehensible interpretation and solution to the problem.",
