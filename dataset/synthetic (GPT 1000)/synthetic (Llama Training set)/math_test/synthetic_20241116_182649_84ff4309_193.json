    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s start unraveling this problem piece by piece.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Parallelogram:**\n   - Alright, we have vertices \\( A(0, 1) \\), \\( B(2, 1) \\), and \\( C(4, 0) \\). We need to find the fourth vertex \\( D \\).\n   - Parallelograms have opposite sides that are equal and parallel. This characteristic will be crucial in determining the location of \\( D \\).\n\n2. **Initial Strategy:**\n   - One way to tackle this is to use the fact that diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. If I can determine the midpoint of one diagonal, it should help find \\( D \\).\n   - Another thought is using vector addition: since opposite sides are parallel and equal, using vectors might simplify locating \\( D \\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Check the Equal and Parallel Sides Method:**\n   - To explore this, I'll consider the possibility that \\( AB \\parallel CD \\) and \\( AD \\parallel BC \\).\n   - Check vectors: Vector \\( AB = (2 - 0, 1 - 1) = (2, 0) \\). So, \\( CD \\) should also be a vector of the form \\( (2, 0) \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Potential \\( D \\) via Parallel Sides:**\n   - If \\( C \\) is at \\( (4, 0) \\) and vector \\( CD = (2, 0) \\), then \\( D = (4 + 2, 0 + 0) = (6, 0) \\) temporarily.\n   - Now, \\( AD \\) should be parallel to \\( BC \\). Vector \\( BC = (4 - 2, 0 - 1) = (2, -1) \\). Check if vector \\( AD = (6 - 0, 0 - 1) = (6, -1) \\) matches. Oh, wait, they aren\u2019t matching. Something feels off.\n\n3. **Recheck the Midpoint Diagonals Method:**\n   - Let\u2019s use the property of bisecting diagonals now.\n   - Midpoint of diagonal \\( AC \\): \\((\\frac{0+4}{2}, \\frac{1+0}{2}) = (2, 0.5)\\).\n   - Assume midpoint of diagonal \\( BD \\) coincides: If \\( B(2, 1) \\) and \\( D(x, y) \\): \n     \\[\n     \\left( \\frac{2 + x}{2}, \\frac{1 + y}{2} \\right) = (2, 0.5)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate \\( D \\) From Midpoint Equality:**\n   - This gives us two equations:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2 + x}{2} = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2 + x = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1 + y}{2} = 0.5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 1 + y = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 0\n     \\]\n   - So, \\( D(2, 0) \\).\n\n5. **Summing Up Coordinates of \\( D \\):**\n   - Now, the sum of coordinates of \\( D \\) is \\( 2 + 0 = 2 \\).\n\n**Double-check:**\n\n- Let\u2019s make sure: \\( D(2, 0) \\) makes vector \\( AD = (2, -1) \\), and \\((AB)\\parallel(CD)\\) since \\( (2, 0)=(2, 0)\\).\n- Parallelism and equal vector length cross-check gives confidence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- My answer is consistent with the properties of a parallelogram.\n- The sum of the coordinates of point \\( D \\) is definitely \\( \\boxed{2} \\). \n\nIn retrospect, utilizing midpoint and vector addition was key due to the inherent symmetrical properties of the parallelogram.",
