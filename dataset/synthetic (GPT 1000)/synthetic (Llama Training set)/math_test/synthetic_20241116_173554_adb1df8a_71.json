    "working_out": "**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst Thoughts: When I first look at the expression \\(\\frac{18!}{16!}\\), I recognize that it involves factorials. I remember that factorial notation, like \\(n!\\), means the product of all positive integers up to \\(n\\). So \\(18!\\) means \\(18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times \\ldots \\times 1\\) and \\(16!\\) is \\(16 \\times 15 \\times \\ldots \\times 1\\).\n\nInitial Strategy: My initial thought is to simplify this expression by thinking about canceling out similar terms. Since both the numerator and the denominator are products starting from 1 and going up to their respective numbers, there should be a neat way to simplify.\n\n**Step 2: Writing the Problem in Expanded Form**\n\nLet's expand both factorials:\n\n- \\[18! = 18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times \\ldots \\times 1\\]\n- \\[16! = 16 \\times 15 \\times \\ldots \\times 1\\]\n\nInsight: Here's a possible insight. Notice that both \\(\\frac{18!}{16!}\\) have a \\('16!'\\) component. This suggests that many terms will cancel out.\n\n**Step 3: Cancel out Common Terms**\n\nSimplification Step: The \\(16!\\) in the numerator and the \\(16!\\) in the denominator can be canceled. What remains from the expansion of \\(18!\\) is \\(18 \\times 17\\).\n\nSo,\n\\[\\frac{18!}{16!} = \\frac{18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times \\ldots \\times 1}{16 \\times 15 \\times \\ldots \\times 1} = 18 \\times 17.\\]\n\nI'm feeling confident this approach is correct given the elimination of common terms, leaving only the additional factors in \\(18!\\).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Remaining Product**\n\nNext Calculation: Now that we have \\(18 \\times 17\\), I'll calculate this product.\n\n\\[18 \\times 17 = 306\\]\n\nQuick Check: After performing the multiplication, the result is 306. I should quickly verify this calculation:\n\n- \\(18 \\times 10 = 180\\) and \\(18 \\times 7 = 126\\)\n- Adding these, \\(180 + 126 = 306\\).\n\nThis checks out. \n\n**Final Step: Conclusion**\n\nReflection: Breaking down the problem and simplifying factorials through cancellation of common terms really sped up finding the solution. The final answer to \\(\\frac{18!}{16!}\\) is 306.\n\n**Verification of Approach**\n\n- My initial setup of the problem recognized the potential for simplification.\n- Every step logically followed from the properties of factorial and arithmetic, with checks that confirmed the calculation.\n\nI'm confident that this solution is both correct and optimal given the structure of the problem.",

  "ground_truth": "We can express $\\frac{18!}{16!}$ as $\\frac{18\\cdot17\\cdot16!}{16!}$. To simplify this expression, we can cancel $16!$ from the numerator and denominator, leaving us with $18\\cdot17$, or $\\boxed{306}$."
