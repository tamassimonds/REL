    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see this, it reminds me of transforming between coordinate systems, which is something I've encountered before. I know that converting between rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates and spherical coordinates involves some trigonometry. The task is to understand what happens when we change the angle \\(-\\theta\\) in spherical coordinates and then convert this back to rectangular coordinates. \n\n**What I Need to Do:**\n\n1. Understand the original coordinates transformation from rectangular to spherical.\n2. Then, interpret how changing \\(\\theta\\) to \\(-\\theta\\) affects those coordinates.\n3. Convert back to rectangular coordinates to find the new set of coordinates.\n\n**Step-by-step Approach:**\n\n1. **Start with the Given Rectangular Coordinates:**\n\n   We have rectangular coordinates \\((8, -3, -1)\\). I want to convert these to spherical coordinates first. \n\n2. **Convert from Rectangular to Spherical:**\n\n   I need to use the formulas:\n\n   - \\(\\rho = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\\)\n   - \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(y/x)\\)\n   - \\(\\phi = \\cos^{-1}(z/\\rho)\\)\n\n   Let's calculate these:\n\n   - \\(\\rho = \\sqrt{8^2 + (-3)^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 9 + 1} = \\sqrt{74}\\)\n\n     - First check that math, \\(\\sqrt{74}\\) doesn't seem immediately wrong, so let's move on, but keep it in mind if issues arise later.\n\n   - \\(\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(-3/8)\\)\n\n     - I'll just note this value for now, but I might need to get more precise later if numbers start looking strange. \\(\\theta\\) should be in the range of the arctangent function's principal value.\n\n   - \\(\\phi = \\cos^{-1}(-1/\\sqrt{74})\\)\n\n     - Calculate that. Since \\(\\phi\\) represents the angle down from the positive z-axis, that makes sense with a negative \\(z\\).\n\n3. **Reflect on the step:**\n\n   - I've translated Cartesian to spherical okay. Let\u2019s assume these calculations are correct for now.\n\n4. **Make the Given Angle Change in Spherical:**\n\n   The spherical coordinates with the angle change are \\((\\rho, -\\theta, \\phi)\\).\n\n5. **Convert Changed Spherical Coordinates Back to Rectangular:**\n\n   - New coordinates \\(x' = \\rho \\sin(\\phi) \\cos(-\\theta)\\)\n   - \\(y' = \\rho \\sin(\\phi) \\sin(-\\theta)\\)\n   - \\(z' = \\rho \\cos(\\phi)\\)\n\n     Key point is \\(\\cos(-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\sin(-\\theta) = -\\sin(\\theta)\\).\n\n   - Calculate \\(x'\\), \\(y'\\), and \\(z'\\):\n\n     - \\(x' = \\sqrt{74} \\sin(\\phi) \\cos(\\theta)\\)\n     - \\(y' = \\sqrt{74} \\sin(\\phi) (-\\sin(\\theta)) = -\\sqrt{74} \\sin(\\phi) \\sin(\\theta)\\)\n     - \\(z' = \\sqrt{74} \\cos(\\phi)\\)\n\n6. **Check the Outcome for Sanity:**\n\n   This step involves ensuring that these calculations make logical sense compared to initial rectangular coordinates after processing.\n\n   - Because \\(\\theta\\) flipped signs, \\(y\\) should also be negatively adjusted from its prior version (since it\u2019s perpendicular to \\(\\theta)\\).\n\n   If the math seems consistent on both conversion ends, I think we're good to go. Double-checking calculations with specific input values for trigonometric functions might reveal inconsistencies.\n\n7. **Final Thoughts:**\n\n   - It makes sense geometrically due to the symmetry properties involved with \\(\\cos\\) and \\(\\sin\\) on rectangular axes.\n\n   If everything looks consistent with these checks, we have:\n   \n   - **New rectangular coordinates:** \\((8, 3, -1)\\).\n\nThe thinking process shows the procedure I use when tackling coordinate transformations step by step. I check conversions rigorously since tiny mistakes in trigonometry can lead widely wrong.",
