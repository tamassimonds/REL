    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by laying out what we're given and what we need to find. We have three points on a line: \\( A(9, 1) \\), \\( B(19, k) \\), and \\( C(7, 0) \\). We need to find the value of \\( k \\) that makes the line consistent through these three points.\n\n#### Brainstorming Phase\n\n- **First thoughts:** I see that this problem involves determining if points are collinear, that's usually about checking if the slopes between the pairs of points are equal. Collinearity directly translates to consistent slopes.\n  \n- **Possible Approaches:**\n  1. Calculate the slope between points \\( A \\) and \\( C \\), and then do the same for points \\( B \\) and \\( C \\). Set them equal to find \\( k \\).\n  2. Use the equation of the line with points \\( A \\) and \\( C \\), and check if point \\( B \\) fits into that line equation.\n  \n  Let's go with the slope method for now.\n\n#### Calculations\n\n1. **Slope between points \\( A(9, 1) \\) and \\( C(7, 0) \\):**\n\n   - The formula for the slope \\( m \\) between two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n     \\]\n\n   - Calculation for \\( m_{AC} \\):\n     \\[\n     m_{AC} = \\frac{0 - 1}{7 - 9} = \\frac{-1}{-2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n     \\]\n   - This seems reasonable as I double-check the arithmetic: indeed, \\( -1 / -2 = 1/2 \\).\n\n2. **Slope between points \\( B(19, k) \\) and \\( C(7, 0) \\):**\n   - Calculation for \\( m_{BC} \\):\n     \\[\n     m_{BC} = \\frac{k - 0}{19 - 7} = \\frac{k}{12}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Setting the slopes equal:**\n\n   For the line to be consistent through all three points, the slopes \\( m_{AC} \\) and \\( m_{BC} \\) must be equal:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{k}{12}\n   \\]\n\n   - Cross-multiply to solve for \\( k \\):\n     \\[\n     k = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6\n     \\]\n     \n#### Reflect and Verify\n\n- **Verify:** Let's verify by putting the value of \\( k = 6 \\) back into our calculation for the slope and ensure it still matches:\n  - New slope \\( m_{BC} = \\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2} \\), which matches \\( m_{AC} \\).\n  \nThis check supports that our work is accurate. **Answer:** \\( k = 6 \\).\n\nThis solution process naturally unfolded from setting up equations to verifying calculations. The key was staying organized and applying basic concepts of coordinate geometry.",
