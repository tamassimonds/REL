    "working_out": "Let's dive into this problem of finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of 1001 and 2431.\n\n---\n\n### Brainstorming\n\nFirst thought:\n\n- \"Finding the greatest common factor often reminds me of something like prime factorization or the Euclidean algorithm. If I can't quickly see common factors, those methods usually help.\"\n\nPossible strategies:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:** Break down each number into its prime factors, and then see which factors they have in common. The greatest product of these common factors is the GCF.\n   \n2. **Euclidean Algorithm:** This is a reliable method for finding the GCF and involves a series of divisions using the remainder. It's based on the principle that GCF(a, b) = GCF(b, a mod b).\n\n3. **Listing Factors:** We could list all factors of both numbers and find the greatest one they have in common, although this might be inefficient for larger numbers like these.\n\nLet's think this through:\n\n- \"1001 and 2431 don\u2019t seem to have obvious common factors like 2 or 5 since they\u2019re not divisible by these. They both look like awkward numbers for factor listing, so maybe prime factorization could reveal something hidden. But I'm favoring the Euclidean Algorithm because it\u2019s systematic and generally quick.\"\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n#### Using the Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n1. Apply the Euclidean Algorithm to find GCF(1001, 2431).\n\n- \"I remember the Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller and then replacing the larger number with the remainder, repeating until the remainder is 0.\"\n\n2. Let's apply it:\n\n   - First, divide 2431 by 1001.\n\n   \\[\n   2431 \\div 1001 = 2 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of} \\quad 2431 - 1001 \\times 2 = 429\n   \\]\n\n   - \"Okay, so the remainder is 429. Now replace 2431 with 1001 and 1001 with 429. Keep going...\"\n\n3. Next, divide 1001 by 429.\n\n   \\[\n   1001 \\div 429 = 2 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of} \\quad 1001 - 429 \\times 2 = 143\n   \\]\n\n   - \"The remainder is 143. Now we use 429 and 143.\"\n\n4. Divide 429 by 143.\n\n   \\[\n   429 \\div 143 = 3 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of} \\quad 429 - 143 \\times 3 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   - \"Ah, now the remainder is 0, which means 143 is the GCF.\"\n\n### Final Reflection:\n\n- \"So, going through the list of remainders like this systematically leads us nicely to the answer. The greatest common factor is 143.\"\n- \"Looking back, I think the Euclidean Method was a good choice here. It handled the problem efficiently without needing to break down the numbers fully through factorization.\"\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe GCF of 1001 and 2431 is **143**. \n\nThis solution feels solid as I've followed through the Euclidean Algorithm step by step, verifying the intermediary calculations and arriving at a reasonable integer, consistent with typical expectations of a GCF being a factor that can divide both original numbers.\n\nThis confirms our strategy and gives us confidence in the solution.
