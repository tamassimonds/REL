    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step-by-step, and I\u2019ll try to lay out my thinking process as naturally as I can.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the expression \\(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{8}{7} \\div \\frac{12}{20}\\). At first glance, this looks like a straightforward order of operations problem involving fractions. I need to remember the order of operations (multiply and divide from left to right) and that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. \n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- \"This seems like it involves both multiplication and division of fractions. I think I remember that you can handle division by multiplying by the reciprocal.\u201d\n- \"I should first change the division to a multiplication by the reciprocal to simplify the process.\"\n- \"Okay, let's confirm each step is right before moving on, because it\u2019s easy to mess up fractions if I\u2019m not careful.\"\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the Division as Multiplication**\n\nThe expression \\(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{8}{7} \\div \\frac{12}{20}\\) can be rewritten using multiplication by the reciprocal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{8}{7} \\cdot \\frac{20}{12}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- \"Let\u2019s check to make sure this is correct. Yep, dividing by \\(\\frac{12}{20}\\) is multiplying by its reciprocal, \\(\\frac{20}{12}\\).\"\n- \"Alright, this looks right to me. Moving on...\"\n\n**Step 3: Multiplying the Fractions**\n\nNow, I multiply the fractions together. I do this by multiplying the numerators together and the denominators together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Numerator: } 1 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 20 = 160\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Denominator: } 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 12 = 420\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{160}{420}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- \"Hmm, 160 and 420 seem like they might have common factors. 160 is pretty large, so this result could be simplified.\"\n- \"Okay, let\u2019s pause here and see if this makes sense. Multiplying fractions involves straightforward multiplication, so I think it\u2019s correct so far.\"\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Fraction**\n\nNow, simplify \\(\\frac{160}{420}\\). First, I\u2019ll find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 160 and 420. I can break them down into their prime factors:\n\n- 160: \\(2^5 \\times 5\\)\n- 420: \\(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7\\)\n\nThe common factors are \\(2^2 \\times 5 = 20\\).\n\nNow, divide both the numerator and the denominator by 20:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{160 \\div 20}{420 \\div 20} = \\frac{8}{21}\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflections:**\n\n- \"Okay, let\u2019s think about whether this makes sense. \\(\\frac{8}{21}\\) seems like it\u2019s in the simplest form because 8 and 21 don\u2019t have common factors.\"\n- \"Let me double-check the factorization step to be sure, but it seems clean and correct.\"\n- \"I should have the final, simplified answer now.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe simplified form of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{8}{7} \\div \\frac{12}{20}\\) is \\(\\frac{8}{21}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "First, we can use the division rule so that we have an expression with only multiplication of fractions.  We get $$\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot \\frac{8}{7}\\div \\frac{12}{20}=\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot \\frac{8}{7}\\cdot \\frac{20}{12}.$$Now, notice that $5$ and $20$ have a common factor of $5$.  We can also see that $8$ and $12$ have a common factor of $4$.  Therefore, we can simplify to get $$\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot \\frac{8}{7}\\cdot \\frac{20}{12}=\\frac{1}{\\cancel{5}}\\cdot \\frac{\\cancelto{2}{8}}{7}\\cdot \\frac{\\cancelto{4}{20}}{\\cancelto{3}{12}}=\\frac{1\\cdot 2 \\cdot 4}{7\\cdot 3}=\\boxed{\\frac{8}{21}}.$$"
