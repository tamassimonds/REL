    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The aim is to find the values of \\( x \\) for which the function \\( y = \\frac{x-2}{x^2-7x+10} \\) is not defined. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\nWhen I first look at this, I'm reminded that functions involving fractions are undefined when the denominator is zero. This expression looks like a rational function, and these tend to be undefined at certain points due to their denominators.\n\n### Step 1: Identify When the Function is Undefined\nThe function \\( y \\) is a rational function, which is undefined whenever the denominator is zero. So, my first instinct tells me to set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n\\[ x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Solving the Quadratic Equation\nThis is a quadratic equation. I'm thinking of using factorization to solve it, as it seems factorable by initial inspection.\n\nThe equation looks like it should factor into two binomial expressions. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 10 and add up to -7. \n\nHmm, thinking like this after years of studying I realize that:\n- Multiply to 10: \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\)\n- Add up to -7: \\( -5 + (-2) = -7 \\)\n\nLooks promising! Let's see if it works:\n- So, \\( x^2 - 7x + 10 = (x - 5)(x - 2) = 0 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Solving the Factors\nIf \\((x - 5)(x - 2) = 0\\), then either \\(x - 5 = 0\\) or \\(x - 2 = 0\\).\n\nSolving these, we get:\n- \\( x = 5 \\)\n- \\( x = 2 \\)\n\n### Step 4: Determining Undefined Points\nThus, the function is undefined for \\( x = 5 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\). These are the two values we\u2019re looking for.\n\n### Final Check\nLet's quickly verify:\n- If \\( x = 5 \\), then the denominator becomes \\( 5^2 - 7\\cdot5 + 10 = 25 - 35 + 10 = 0 \\). So it\u2019s consistent with our findings.\n- If \\( x = 2 \\), then the denominator becomes \\( 2^2 - 7\\cdot2 + 10 = 4 - 14 + 10 = 0 \\). Again, consistent.\n\nYes, everything checks out. The function is undefined for exactly two values of \\( x \\), which are \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = 5 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nSo, there are 2 values of \\( x \\) for which the function \\( y = \\frac{x-2}{x^2-7x+10} \\) is not defined.\n\nReflecting back, this method of setting the denominator to zero and solving the quadratic was indeed the correct approach. Everything seems logical and consistent with how rational functions behave.",

  "ground_truth": "By factoring the denominator, the equation becomes \\[y=\\frac{x-2}{(x-2)(x-5)}.\\]The function is not defined when the denominator is 0, which occurs at $x = 2$ and $x = 5$.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$ values of $x$ for which the function is not defined."
