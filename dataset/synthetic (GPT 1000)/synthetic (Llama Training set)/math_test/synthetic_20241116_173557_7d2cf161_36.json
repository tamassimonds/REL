  "problem": "Recently, Frank took a one-hundred question aptitude test where each correct answer scored $5$ points, each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and each question not answered scored zero points. Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points. How many questions did he answer correctly?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem! I\u2019ll start by jotting down my initial thoughts and then work through the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nAt first glance, this problem reminds me of those classic algebra problems where you're given a set of conditions and you have to figure out the values that satisfy all those conditions. I know Frank answered 80 questions out of 100, and his score was 232. I need to find out how many he got correct. It seems like a typical system of equations problem because I can set two unknowns: the number of correct answers and the number of incorrect answers.\n\n### Brainstorming Possible Approaches\n1. **Equations Approach:** Use two variables, one for correct answers (\\(x\\)) and one for incorrect answers (\\(y\\)). We know how many questions were answered and the total score, so I can come up with two equations and solve for the variables.\n2. **Trial and Error Method:** Start from an assumption about correct answers and calculate the rest to see if it matches. This might be cumbersome, but it could work with rough guesses.\n3. **Logical Deduction:** Consider the score contributions from correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions directly and adjust based on constraints.\n\nLet's start with the equations approach, as it feels like a method that will give a clear path to the solution.\n\n### Developing the Equations\n\n1. **Number of Questions Answered:**\n   Since Frank answered 80 questions, the sum of correct and incorrect answers should be 80:\n   \\[\n   x + y = 80\n   \\]\n   where \\(x\\) is the number of correct answers and \\(y\\) is the number of incorrect answers.\n\n2. **Score Calculation:**\n   Correct answers contribute \\(5\\) points each and incorrect answers contribute \\(-2\\) points.\n   Thus, the score equation is:\n   \\[\n   5x - 2y = 232\n   \\]\n\n### Solving the System of Equations\n\nI\u2019ll solve these two equations simultaneously.\n\n**Equation 1:** \n\\[ \nx + y = 80 \n\\]\n\n**Equation 2:** \n\\[ \n5x - 2y = 232 \n\\]\n\nTo eliminate one variable, I can use substitution or elimination. I'll go with elimination.\n\nMultiply Equation 1 by 2 to match the \\(y\\)-terms:\n\\[ \n2x + 2y = 160 \n\\]\n\nNow add this to Equation 2:\n\\[ \n5x - 2y + 2x + 2y = 232 + 160\n\\]\n\\[ \n7x = 392 \n\\]\n\nNow solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{392}{7} = 56 \n\\]\n\nSo, Frank answered 56 questions correctly. Let\u2019s quickly verify by finding \\(y\\).\n\n### Verification by Finding \\(y\\)\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 56\\) back into Equation 1:\n\\[ \n56 + y = 80 \n\\]\n\\[ \ny = 80 - 56 = 24 \n\\]\n\n### Final Check of Calculation\n\nNow, verify if this fits Equation 2:\n\\[ \n5(56) - 2(24) = 280 - 48 = 232 \n\\]\n\nYes, this checks out perfectly with the conditions!\n\n### Conclusion \n\nFrank answered 56 questions correctly. Reflecting on this process, the equation method was a clean approach that provided a straightforward path to the solution without excessive guessing. Always good to confirm with back-substitution like we did here. Everything seems coherent, and these steps logically follow from the problem statement.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the number of questions Frank answered correctly be $a$ and the number of questions he answered incorrectly be $b$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=80\\\\\n5a-2b&=232\n\\end{align*} From the first equation, we have $b=80-a$. Substituting this into the second equation to eliminate $b$, we have $5a-2(80-a)=232\\Rightarrow a=56$. Thus, Frank answered $\\boxed{56}$ questions correctly."
