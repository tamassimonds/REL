    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and start breaking it down step by step. The task here is to determine the number of 3-letter sequences such that the second letter must be a vowel and the third letter must be different from the first letter. \n\n### Initial Thoughts and Exploration:\n\n1. **Understanding the Structure:**\n   - We're dealing with a 3-letter sequence: let's denote these as positions 1, 2, and 3.\n   - **Position 2:** Must be a vowel (A, E, I, O, U). Hence, there are 5 choices here.\n   - **Position 3:** Must be different from Position 1.\n\n2. **Brainstorming Strategy:**\n   - One immediate strategy that comes to mind is considering choices separately for each position and then combining them. \n   - For Position 1: Any letter from the alphabet (A-Z), so 26 possibilities.\n   - For Position 2: Already decided as a vowel with 5 options.\n   - For Position 3: Needs consideration because it depends on Position 1.\n\n3. **Initial Reflection:**\n   - We've clarified roles for each position. Each letter's choice is influenced by different constraints - important for counting accurately.\n   - Think: \"Do I multiply the choices together or consider constraints differently?\" This problem reminds me of combinatorial problems with conditions on elements.\n\n### Detailed Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Calculate for Position 1:**\n   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, so Position 1 has 26 potential choices.\n\n2. **Calculate for Position 2:**\n   - As per conditions, Position 2 must be a vowel (A, E, I, O, or U), giving us 5 choices for Position 2.\n\n3. **Calculate for Position 3:**\n   - Position 3 must be different from Position 1. \n   - If Position 1 is chosen, then we have 25 options left for Position 3.\n\n4. **Combining Choices:**\n   - For each choice of Position 1, there are independent choices for Positions 2 and 3.\n   - Hence, the total number of sequences is computed by multiplying the number of choices for each position.\n   - Total sequences = Choices for Position 1 \u00d7 Choices for Position 2 \u00d7 Choices for Position 3 = 26 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 25.\n\n5. **Perform the Calculation:**\n   - \\(26 \\times 5 = 130\\) (Confirming: okay, this seems straightforward.)\n   - \\(130 \\times 25 = 3250\\) (Breaking down: \\(130 \\times 25 = 130 \\times (20 + 5) = 2600 + 650 = 3250\\))\n\n### Reflections and Checks:\n\n- **Double-check intuition:** The setup seems good. Each position\u2019s rule is applied separately, and we\u2019ve accounted for every constraint. Position 3 is designed to ensure it isn't equal to Position 1.\n- **Revisiting Constraints:** Important check - have we missed any variable constraints? No, because each selection respects the condition for Position 1 and Position 3 interaction.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe total number of valid 3-letter sequences, considering the requirements given, is **3250**. \n\nAlways encouraging these reflective layers - initially bouncing between different elements, then narrowing down to evaluating specific conditions - proved effective. This approach shows that even with simple arithmetic, considering conditions in sequence significantly affects the outcome.",

  "ground_truth": "There are 26 options for the first letter, only 5 options for the second (vowels only), and 25 options for the third letter (all letters but the first letter).  This gives $26 \\times 5 \\times 25 = \\boxed{3,\\!250}$ combinations."
