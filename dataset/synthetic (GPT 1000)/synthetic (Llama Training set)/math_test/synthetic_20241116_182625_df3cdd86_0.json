    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see what's going on here.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nHmm, what is the problem asking exactly? We start with a square of side length 1 centimeter. Then every minute, 2 centimeters are added to each side. This means we're increasing the side of the square linearly. After 10 minutes, we need to find the difference between the area of this final square and the initial square. Seems straightforward enough, where the trick might be in accurately setting up the calculation for the areas at the start and end.\n\n### Finding a Strategy\n\nWhat strategies could be useful here? \n\n1. **Step-by-step Increment of Sides**: Calculate the side length after each minute and the area at each step, then get the difference. Sounds like a lot of repetitive calculations, but could verify results at each point.\n   \n2. **Direct Calculation of Final Area**: Directly compute the side length after 10 minutes, calculate the area, and then subtract the initial area. This approach is probably more efficient.\n   \n3. **Check If There's an Arithmetic Series Trick**: Since the sides grow linearly, I could consider if there's a faster way using a series or formula, but here it looks simple enough to handle without too much complexity.\n\n### Let's Go with the Direct Calculation (Seems Straightforward)\n\n1. **Calculate Initial Area**:\n   - Initial side length is \\(1 \\text{ cm}\\).\n   - Area is \\((1 \\text{ cm})^2 = 1 \\text{ square cm}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate Final Side Length**:\n   - Each minute, 2 cm is added to each side.\n   - After 10 minutes, added length is \\(2 \\text{ cm/min} \\times 10 \\text{ min} = 20 \\text{ cm}\\).\n   - Final side length = initial side length + added length \\(= 1 \\text{ cm} + 20 \\text{ cm} = 21 \\text{ cm}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate Final Area**:\n   - Final area is \\((21 \\text{ cm})^2 = 441 \\text{ square cm}\\).\n\n4. **Find the Difference**:\n   - Difference in area = final area - initial area\n   - Difference = \\(441 \\text{ square cm} - 1 \\text{ square cm} = 440 \\text{ square cm}\\).\n\n### Verification and Reflection\n\n- Does this make sense? Yes, we started from a small area (1 cm\u00b2) and ended up with a much larger area as expected after a significant increase in the side length.\n- Is this the simplest and correct approach? I believe so. We didn't really need to calculate each intermediate step since the linear growth was easy to handle overall, and taking the difference in just two big steps gave us what was required accurately.\n- Finally, all units are consistent throughout, and the basic math checks out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final difference in areas is \\(440\\) square centimeters.",

  "ground_truth": "The initial square has area $1^2 = 1\\text{ cm}^2$. After ten minutes, the side length of the square will be $1 + 2\\cdot 10 = 21\\text{ cm}$. So, the last square has area $21^2 = 441\\text{ cm}^2$. So the difference in areas is $441 - 1 = \\boxed{440\\text{ cm}^2}$."
