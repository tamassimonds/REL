    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem.\n\nFirst thoughts:\nWhen I see a problem involving a rectangular box with volume and surface area, I immediately recall connections between dimensions. The volume is given, and we need to minimize the surface area. I'm reminded of an optimization problem from calculus.\n\nInitial approach:\nVolume of a rectangular box is \\( V = l \\times w \\times h \\), where \\( l \\), \\( w \\), and \\( h \\) are the length, width, and height. For our box, this is \\( 216 = l \\times w \\times h \\). \n\nSurface area is given by \\( S = 2(lw + lh + wh) \\). Our task is to minimize \\( S \\) given \\( V = 216 \\).\n\nHmm, this reminds me of something I've done with constrained optimization but without calculus... I guess we could search for symmetric dimensions first since equilateral shapes often minimize surface area for a given volume.\n\nLet's brainstorm a bit:\n1. Could the box be a cube? If all sides are equal, \\( l = w = h \\).\n   - \\( l^3 = 216 \\), so \\( l = \\sqrt[3]{216} = 6 \\).\n   - In this case, both \\( V = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216 \\) and the surface area \\( S = 6 \\times 2(6 \\times 6) = 216 \\).\n   - Is this the minimum? Hmm... \n\n2. What about non-symmetric options? Let\u2019s try checking a few combinations around this:\n   - Fix two sides and see the third. If \\( l = 6 \\) and \\( w = 6 \\), to maintain the volume: \n      - \\( h = \\frac{216}{6 \\times 6} = 6 \\).\n   - This is the same as the cube case!\n\nOkay, wait, let\u2019s explore rectangular configurations by fixing one side, say:\n- If \\( l = 9 \\), and fix \\( w \\), then \\( h = \\frac{216}{l \\times w} \\).\n\nCheck different \\( w \\) values:\n- \\( w = 6 \\): \\( h = \\frac{216}{9 \\times 6} = 4 \\). The surface area:\n  - \\( S = 2(9 \\times 6 + 9 \\times 4 + 6 \\times 4) = 2(54 + 36 + 24) = 228 \\).\n  - Hmm, that\u2019s more than 216. Let\u2019s adjust again.\n\n- \\( l = 12 \\), \\( w = 3 \\), \\( h = \\frac{216}{12 \\times 3} = 6 \\). Surface area check:\n  - \\( S = 2(12 \\times 3 + 12 \\times 6 + 3 \\times 6) = 2(36 + 72 + 18) = 252 \\).\n\nThis doesn\u2019t seem to optimize further... Hmm.\n\nReflection:\nIs there an alternative? I\u2019m expecting a more symmetric fixture to potentially yield the minimum, given initial tests.\n\nDeeper thought:\nThe original symmetric option (where \\( l = w = h = 6 \\)) provides the outcome of surface area as 216. This makes sense geometrically given the square nature.\n\nConclusion:\nThrough checking various configurations around the cube, all other configurations seem to yield higher surface areas given our constraints. Thus, the cube case indeed provides the minimum surface area for the conditions.\n\n**Final Answer: Smallest possible surface area is 216 when the box is a cube with dimensions 6x6x6.**",

  "ground_truth": "Let $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ be the dimensions of the box, so $abc = 216.$  Then the surface area is\n\\[2(ab + ac + bc).\\]By AM-GM,\n\\[ab + ac + bc \\ge 3 \\sqrt[3]{(ab)(ac)(bc)} = 3 \\sqrt[3]{a^2 b^2 c^2} = 108,\\]so $2(ab + ac + bc) \\ge 216.$\n\nEquality occurs when $a = b = c = 6,$ so the smallest possible surface area is $\\boxed{216}.$"
