    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Okay, the equation is \\(\\frac{1\\frac{1}{6}}{w} = \\frac{42}{3}\\). Immediately, I recognize this as an equation involving fractions and variables. \n- At first glance, it seems similar to many algebraic problems I've encountered before. The structure involves simplifying and solving for \\(w\\), which is pretty standard.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Converting Mixed Number to Improper Fraction:**\n   - The mixed number \\(1 \\frac{1}{6}\\). How can we work with it? Right, convert it to an improper fraction.\n   - \\(1 \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{7}{6}\\).\n\n2. **Evaluating the Right Side:**\n   - The fraction \\(\\frac{42}{3}\\) simplifies to a whole number. Let's simplify it.\n   - \\(\\frac{42}{3} = 14\\).\n\n3. **Rewriting the Equation:**\n   - Substitute these into the original equation: \n   \\[\\frac{\\frac{7}{6}}{w} = 14\\].\n\n**Checking for Mistakes So Far:**\n\n- Conversion to improper fraction looks correct. \\(\\frac{7}{6}\\) seems right after double-checking.\n- Simplifying \\(\\frac{42}{3}\\) to 14 makes sense because dividing 42 by 3 definitely gives 14.\n\n**Solving the Equation:**\n\n- Now we have \\(\\frac{\\frac{7}{6}}{w} = 14\\).\n- Wait, let's think how fractions work. It seems similar to \\(\\frac{a}{b} = c\\) can be rewritten as \\(a = bc\\).\n- So, \\(\\frac{7}{6} = 14w\\).\n\n**Solving for \\(w\\):**\n\n- Now solve for \\(w\\): \\(w = \\frac{7}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{14}\\).\n- Simplify \\(w = \\frac{7}{6 \\times 14}\\).\n\n**Calculating the Denominator:**\n\n- Realizing I should simplify the fraction: \\(6 \\times 14 = 84\\).\n- \\(w = \\frac{7}{84}\\).\n\n**Simplifying the Final Fraction:**\n\n- Check if \\(\\frac{7}{84}\\) can be simplified by dividing by 7 because both numbers are divisible by 7.\n- \\(w = \\frac{1}{12}\\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- I believe I\u2019ve accounted for all simplifications and rewritings correctly.\n- I\u2019ll check by plugging back into the original equation:\n  - Substitute \\(w = \\frac{1}{12}\\) into \\(\\frac{1 \\frac{1}{6}}{w} = 14\\).\n  - \\(\\frac{\\frac{7}{6}}{\\frac{1}{12}}\\).\n  - Wait a second, division by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.\n  - That becomes \\(\\frac{7}{6} \\times 12 = 14\\), seems correct as the math checks out.\n\nThe solution for \\(w\\) is indeed correct, \\(w = \\frac{1}{12}\\). That makes logical sense as all calculations were verified. There's no dead end or mistake that stands out now.",

  "ground_truth": "Simplifying the left side gives \\[\\frac{1\\frac16}{w} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{6}}{w} = \\frac{7}{6}\\cdot\\frac1w = \\frac{7}{6w},\\] so the equation is \\[\\frac{7}{6w} = \\frac{42}{3} = 14.\\] Multiplying both sides by $6w$ gives $7=14(6w)$.  Dividing both sides by 7 gives $1=2(6w)$, and dividing both sides by 12 gives $w = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$."
