    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem with a brainstorming session. The problem asks for the probability that exactly two CDs are in the wrong cases out of four CDs placed in cases randomly. \n\n**Initial Thoughts and Exploration:**\n\n1. **Understand the Scenario**: \n   - We have 4 CDs and 4 cases.\n   - Possibility of placing them correctly, partially correctly, or completely wrong.\n   - Complete permutation of 4 items gives \\(4!\\).\n\n2. **Identifying the Probability Event**:\n   - We specifically want **exactly** two CDs to be in the wrong cases.\n   - This sounds like a classic permutation problem mixed with restrictions.\n\n3. **Strategies to Approach**:\n   - **Derangement/Permutation Insight**: A derangement is a permutation where no element appears in its original position. Here, we need a scenario where exactly 2 are correctly placed. But first, is this a derangement problem?\n   - **Direct Enumeration Approach**: List possibilities, count cases, check wrong cases.\n\n4. **Reevaluate Understanding**:\n   - Wait. If two CDs are placed in the wrong cases, can two be correct? Hmm. If two are correct by placement, the other two CDs incorrectly placed implies those remaining intersections work. I smell some inherent contradiction. \n\n**Re-evaluating & Exploring Further**:\n\n1. **Back to Basic Logistics**:\n   - If two CDs are correctly placed, does that mean the other two must also be correctly placed? Yes. Because if the remaining two were in the wrong cases, it would be a perfect swap\u2014so now actually, that's not possible! \n   - If two are wrong, it means a simultaneous contradiction: cannot have two correct and two exactly incorrect with the remaining left open by others.\n\n2. **Derangement Gremlins**:\n   - It seems like this hints back to fully surjectively understanding for n=4, with no simple 'just the two', making it **0 possibilities for exactly two wrong**.\n\n3. **Calculating without Err**:\n   - What was attempted: Alternative pairings.\n   - Realization from Logical Inference: Two correct implies only one wrong set.\n   - Numerical Enumeration: Start at 0, iterate combinatoric perspective with permissible shirtings.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFinally, wrapping up the extensive deductions and explorations: It's just an impossibility in perfect direct pair distinction within the constraints. The likelihood/condition presents inherent contradiction-based zero probability! Meaning:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{0}{4!} = 0 \\]\n\n**Check our thought process**: Every avenue (permutation, case exploration, dual regression fails), confirms through contrasting and closings with basic bounds, our realization of impossibility proved true.\n\nSo, the final correct probability that exactly two CDs are in the wrong cases is precisely:\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous analysis. Let's re-examine the situation and work through it systematically again.\n\n**Reflections and Adjustments:**\n\n1. **Initial Thought Error**:   \n   - In my previous analysis, I mistakenly concluded that having exactly two CDs in the wrong positions was impossible. It seems I misunderstood the arrangement constraints, leading to a flawed conclusion.\n\n2. **New Approach and Exploration**:   \n   - Let's start afresh with the understanding that exactly two CDs in their correct cases implies the other two must have been swapped. This aligns with a probability distribution over permutations.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reassessment:**\n\n1. **Understand the Correctness Condition**:\n   - Out of 4 CDs, we select any 2 to be placed correctly. The other 2 will naturally fall into places where they are not intended. \n\n2. **Counting Favorable Arrangements**:\n   - There are \\( \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\) ways to choose 2 CDs to be correctly placed.\n   \n3. **Verification Test with Permutation**:\n   - Check these arrangements by identifying all permutations of the set: Each selection of two correct implies that automatically the remaining two must be swapped, justifying the 6 valid pairings.\n\n4. **Total Outcome Possibility**:\n   - Total possible permutations of the CDs without condition interference are \\(4! = 24\\).\n\n5. **Calculate Probability**:\n   - Now, we can confidently say: the probability of exactly 2 CDs being in the correct cases is \\(\\frac{6}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nBy recalibrating my approach and verifying through combination and permutation insights, I've found that the probability of exactly two CDs being in the wrong cases is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\\). This solution aligns correctly with a logical understanding of permutations and confirming the possible arrangements.",

  "ground_truth": "Given any pair of the 4 CDs, there is exactly one arrangement with only these two CDs in the correct cases, because each of the remaining two CDs must be in the case of the other one.  Therefore, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ arrangements of the CDs for which exactly two of the CDs are in the correct case.  The probability that one of these 6 arrangements will be chosen from among the $4!=24$ equally likely arrangements is $\\dfrac{6}{24}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}$."
