    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step-by-step. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d approach it:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question\nFirst, I need to deconstruct what the problem is asking. I need to find the maximum value of the quotient \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\), where both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are distinct elements from the set \\(\\left\\{\\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{1}{2}, 5, 10\\right\\}\\). \n\nTo maximize this quotient, generally, I would want to have the largest possible number as the numerator and the smallest possible number as the denominator.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Elements in the Set\nThe given set elements are: \n- \\(\\frac{2}{5} \\approx 0.4\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\\)\n- \\(5\\)\n- \\(10\\)\n\n### Step 3: Strategy Brainstorming\n- Since I want to maximize \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\), the ideal approach is to pick the largest possible value for \\(x\\) and the smallest possible value for \\(y\\).\n  \n- Begin by checking the largest value in the set for the numerator, which is \\(10\\).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Potential Combinations\nNow let's compute \\(\\frac{10}{y}\\) for the smallest possible values of \\(y\\):\n\n1. \\(y = \\frac{2}{5}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{\\frac{2}{5}} = 10 \\times \\frac{5}{2} = 25\n   \\]\n\n2. \\(y = \\frac{1}{2}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 10 \\times 2 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. \\(y = 5\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{5} = 2\n   \\]\n\nThe goal is to test which of these is the largest.\n\n### Step 5: Compare Results\n- \\(\\frac{10}{\\frac{2}{5}} = 25\\)\n- \\(\\frac{10}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 20\\)\n- \\(\\frac{10}{5} = 2\\)\n\nAmong these, \\(25\\) is the largest quotient.\n\n### Step 6: Verification\nIs there another way to make a larger quotient? \n- Could using a different numerator make a difference? Checking quickly:\n  - The next largest value is \\(5\\). However, \\(\\frac{5}{\\frac{2}{5}} = 12.5\\) and \\(\\frac{5}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 10\\). Both are lower than \\(25\\).\n  \n### Step 7: Conclude\nIt seems quite certain that \\(\\frac{10}{\\frac{2}{5}} = 25\\) is the greatest possible quotient of any two distinct members in the set. The step-by-step evaluations and comparison ensure this result.\n\nThus, the greatest possible quotient is \\(\\boxed{25}\\).",
