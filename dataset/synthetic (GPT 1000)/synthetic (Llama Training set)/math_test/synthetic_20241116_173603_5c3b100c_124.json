    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by first breaking down and understanding what we're dealing with.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a weighted coin. This implies that the probabilities of heads and tails are not the usual 50/50.\n   - Heads Probability: \\( P(H) = \\frac{3}{4} \\)\n   - Tails Probability: \\( P(T) = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n   - If it lands on heads, we earn 2 dollars. If it lands on tails, we lose 1 dollar.\n   - We're trying to find the expected value of a single coin flip, which in general is calculated as: \\( E(X) = \\sum [P(x_i) \\times x_i] \\) where \\( x_i \\) are the possible outcomes.\n\n2. **Brainstorming:**\n   - My initial thought is to simply apply the rule of expected value calculation. Here, the outcomes are monetary gains or losses based on the coin flip.\n   - I should compute the contribution of each possible outcome (heads or tails) by using their respective probabilities and monetary results.\n\n3. **Calculating Expected Value:**\n   - Let's think through the possible scenarios and their contributions to the expected value:\n     - **Scenario 1:** Flipping Heads\n       - Probability: \\( P(H) = \\frac{3}{4} \\)\n       - Outcome: +2 dollars\n       - Contribution to Expected Value = Probability \\( \\times \\) Outcome = \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 2 = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \\)\n     - **Scenario 2:** Flipping Tails\n       - Probability: \\( P(T) = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n       - Outcome: -1 dollar\n       - Contribution to Expected Value = Probability \\( \\times \\) Outcome = \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times (-1) = -\\frac{1}{4} = -0.25 \\)\n\n4. **Combining Contributions:**\n   - Now, sum the contributions from both scenarios to find the total expected value:\n   - Total Expected Value \\( E(X) = 1.5 + (-0.25) = 1.5 - 0.25 = 1.25 \\)\n\n5. **Reflection and Checking:**\n   - Let's reflect if this makes logical sense. Since the coin is biased towards heads which offers monetary gain, it seems reasonable that the expected value is positive.\n   - The calculations seem consistent with our approach of combining the weighted outcomes using their probabilities.\n   - I don't see any arithmetic errors in the process either.\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - The expected value of a single flip of this weighted coin is \\( 1.25 \\) dollars.\n\nThis step-by-step methodology illuminates my understanding and reasoning at each stage, ensuring the full solution is clear and thorough.",
