    "working_out": "Okay, let's start by really understanding the problem at hand. We're given a function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x^2 + x + 5}{x^2 + 4x + c} \\) and asked to find the smallest integer value of \\( c \\) such that the function is defined for all real numbers. This means that the denominator \\( x^2 + 4x + c \\) cannot be zero for any real number \\( x \\).\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Denominator**\n\nThe denominator is a quadratic expression \\( x^2 + 4x + c \\). For the function to be defined for all \\( x \\), the quadratic should have no real roots; in other words, it should be either always positive or always negative. Since this is a quadratic with a positive leading coefficient (the \\( x^2 \\) term), it makes sense to look for when it is always positive, ensuring there are no real zeros.\n\n**Step 2: Check Discriminant Condition**\n\nThe roots of a quadratic \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) (here, \\( a = 1, b = 4, c = c \\), a bit confusing with the repeating letter, but it's fine) are given by the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nFor the roots to be non-real, the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) must be less than zero.\n\n- Calculate the discriminant:\n  - Here, \\( a = 1, b = 4, \\) and the \\( c \\) in the discriminant formula is actually \\( c \\) from \\( x^2 + 4x + c \\), not \\( ac \\) as used above. Sorry for any confusion earlier.\n  \n  \\[\n  \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot c = 16 - 4c\n  \\]\n\n- Set \\( \\Delta < 0 \\) for no real roots:\n\n  \\[\n  16 - 4c < 0\n  \\]\n\n  Solving this inequality:\n\n  \\[\n  16 < 4c \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4 < c\n  \\]\n\n- Therefore, \\( c \\) must be greater than 4. The smallest integer greater than 4 is 5.\n\n**Step 3: Verify**\n\nWhen \\( c = 5 \\):\n\n- The discriminant becomes:\n\n  \\[\n  16 - 4 \\times 5 = 16 - 20 = -4\n  \\]\n\nSince \\(-4 < 0\\), the quadratic \\( x^2 + 4x + 5 \\) has no real roots and is always positive for \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy ensuring the discriminant is negative, we've found the smallest integer \\( c \\) such that the function \\( f(x) \\) is defined for all real \\( x \\). This value is \\( c = 5 \\).\n\nReflecting, everything seems correct \u2014 the logic flows well with the conditions required for the quadratic to be always positive, confirming that the function will have a domain of all real numbers when \\( c = 5 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "The given function has a domain of all real numbers if and only if the denominator is never equal to zero.  In other words, the quadratic $x^2 + 4x + c = 0$ has no real roots.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $16 - 4c$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $16 - 4c < 0$, or $c > 4$.  The smallest integer $c$ that satisfies this inequality is $c = \\boxed{5}$."
