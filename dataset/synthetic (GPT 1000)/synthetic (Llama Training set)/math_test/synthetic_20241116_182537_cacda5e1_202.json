    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nFirst, I'm given a quadratic equation \\(3x^2 + 4x + c = 0\\) and I'm asked to determine the value of \\(c\\) that results in exactly one solution for \\(x\\). I immediately recall that a quadratic equation has exactly one solution (a double root) when its discriminant is zero. The discriminant, \\(\\Delta\\), for a quadratic equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) is given by \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\).\n\nFor the equation to have exactly one solution, I need:\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = 0 \\]\n\n### Trying to Apply Discriminant\nHere, \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 4\\), and \\(c\\) is the unknown that I'm trying to solve for. Plugging these into the discriminant formula gives:\n\\[ 4^2 - 4 \\times 3 \\times c = 0 \\]\n\n### Simplifying the Discriminant\nLet's work this out:\n\\[ 16 - 12c = 0 \\]\n\nSubtract 16 from both sides:\n\\[ -12c = -16 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by -12 to solve for \\(c\\):\n\\[ c = \\frac{-16}{-12} \\]\n\nHmm, before simplifying, let\u2019s make sure that checks out logically. Both sides are negative, so the negatives cancel:\n\\[ c = \\frac{16}{12} \\]\n\nReducing this fraction gives:\n\\[ c = \\frac{4}{3} \\]\n\n### Double-checking the Calculation\nLet\u2019s verify: In cases I rush, I often make small mistakes with arithmetic. \n\n1. Discriminant is calculated as \\(16 - 12c = 0\\).\n2. Solving gives \\(c = \\frac{16}{12}\\).\n3. Simplifying indeed gives \\(c = \\frac{4}{3}\\).\n\n### Final Thoughts\nThinking about this problem in terms of the discriminant was the key insight here. Knowing that the discriminant must equal zero for a double root made it straightforward to follow through the calculations.\n\n##### Verification\nLet's substitute our \\(c = \\frac{4}{3}\\) back into the discriminant to see if it results in zero:\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4 \\times 3 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 16 - 16 = 0 \\]\n\nPerfect, the discriminant is indeed zero. This confirms the quadratic equation will have exactly one solution with this \\(c\\).\n\nIn conclusion, the value of \\(c\\) that gives exactly one solution for \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\). This approach of using the discriminant systematically checked out, and everything looks solid.",

  "ground_truth": "We will have one solution for $x$ when our discriminant is zero. Our discriminant is $b^2 - 4ac = (4)^2 - 4(3)(c) = 16 - 12c.$ Setting this to zero, we have $16 - 12c = 0,$ so $c = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{3}}.$"
