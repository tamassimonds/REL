    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and take it step by step. First off, I'll write my initial thoughts and brainstorm how to approach the problem.\n\n### First Thoughts\n- The question is introducing a new operation here, `*`, which is defined by `a * b = a^b + b^a`. This is not the same as multiplication we're used to, so I need to remember this special definition.\n- I'm asked to find the value of `2 * 6`. My task is to use the given definition and compute it.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n- Given `a * b = a^b + b^a`, with `a = 2` and `b = 6`, I need to calculate `2^6 + 6^2`.\n- This doesn't seem too difficult since it involves straightforward computation once we plug in the values.\n\n### Exploring Calculation\n- Sometimes exponentiation can lead to large numbers, so I should be ready for a potentially large result:\n  - First, calculate `2^6`: \n    - `2^6` is essentially `2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2`\n    - It's like doubling from `2`: first step is `4`, second step will be `8`, third step is `16`, fourth step is `32`, and finally, `64`.\n    - So, `2^6 = 64`.\n  - Next, calculate `6^2`: \n    - `6^2` is `6 * 6`, which is `36`.\n    - Quickly double-checking the multiplication in my head sounds fine because `6 * 6 = (6 * 5) + 6 = 30 + 6 = 36`.\n  - Add these two results together: \n    - `64 + 36`.\n\n### Quick Check\n- Before adding, I reflect on whether my calculations so far make sense:\n  - `2^6 = 64` seems correct, as verified by repeatedly doubling.\n  - `6^2 = 36` is a straightforward multiplication.\n  - The operation `*` as defined has been followed correctly.\n\n### Perform Addition\n- Now, summing up: \n  - `64 + 36`.\n- Let me calculate this:\n  - Adding tens first: `60 + 30 = 90`.\n  - Adding units: `4 + 6 = 10`.\n  - Summing results together: `90 + 10 = 100`.\n\n### Final Check\n- I think through the problem structure: \n  - Calculations seem consistent with the operation's definition.\n  - Each step was verified independently.\n\n### Conclusion\n- The value of `2 * 6` based on the given operation is `100`.\n\nIt's interesting how breaking down the steps like this ensures that each piece is checked and helps catch errors early. This methodical approach reassures me that the final result is correct.",
