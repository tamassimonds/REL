    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think it through step by step.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nThis problem involves finding the area of a triangle bounded by three lines. I've worked with line equations and triangles before, so this feels like a problem that will involve some geometry and algebra. My first inclination is to find the points where these lines intersect because the vertices of the triangle will be at these intersections. Once I have the vertices, I can use a formula to find the area.\n\nThe equations given are:\n- \\( y = 0 \\) (which is the x-axis),\n- \\( y = x + 4 \\),\n- \\( x + 3y = 12 \\).\n\n**Step 1: Find the Points of Intersection**\n\nLet's start by finding where these lines intersect.\n\n- **Intersection of \\( y = 0 \\) and \\( y = x + 4 \\):**\n  - Substitute \\( y = 0 \\) into \\( y = x + 4 \\): \n    \\[\n    0 = x + 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -4\n    \\]\n  - So, the intersection point here is \\((-4, 0)\\).\n\n- **Intersection of \\( y = 0 \\) and \\( x + 3y = 12 \\):**\n  - Substitute \\( y = 0 \\) into \\( x + 3y = 12 \\):\n    \\[\n    x + 3(0) = 12 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 12\n    \\]\n  - So, the intersection point here is \\((12, 0)\\).\n\n- **Intersection of \\( y = x + 4 \\) and \\( x + 3y = 12 \\):**\n  - Substitute \\( y = x + 4 \\) into \\( x + 3y = 12 \\):\n    \\[\n    x + 3(x + 4) = 12\n    \\]\n  - Simplifying:\n    \\[\n    x + 3x + 12 = 12 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4x + 12 = 12 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4x = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 0\n    \\]\n  - Plug \\( x = 0 \\) back into \\( y = x + 4 \\):\n    \\[\n    y = 0 + 4 = 4\n    \\]\n  - So, the intersection point here is \\((0, 4)\\).\n\nOkay! Now, I've got all three vertices of the triangle:\n- \\((-4, 0)\\),\n- \\((12, 0)\\),\n- \\((0, 4)\\).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Triangle**\n\nI remember there's a formula to calculate the area of a triangle given its vertices \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), \\((x_3, y_3)\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\nLet's substitute the vertices into this formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (-4)(0-4) + 12(4-0) + 0(0-0) \\right|\n\\]\nCalculating inside the absolute value:\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (-4)(-4) + 12(4) + 0 \\right|\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 16 + 48 + 0 \\right|\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\times 64 = 32\n\\]\n\n**Reflection and Double-checking:**\n\nBefore I conclude, let's check these calculations for any errors. I have one intersection point on the x-axis, one on the line, and one where the two non-axis lines intersect, which makes sense geometrically for a triangular shape. The algebra for intersections looks correct as well, and the area calculation seems solid. I don't see any glaring issues, so I feel confident in this solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe area of the triangle bounded by the lines \\( y = 0 \\), \\( y = x + 4 \\), and \\( x + 3y = 12 \\) is \\( 32 \\) square units.",

  "ground_truth": "This triangle's vertices are the intersection points of each pair of lines. The intersection point of $y=0$ and $y=x+4$ is (-4,0). The intersection point of $y=0$ and $x+3y=12$ is (12,0). To find the intersection of the last 2 lines, we substitute the first equation for $y$ and then solve for $x$. Doing so, we get \\begin{align*}\nx+3y&=12 \\\\\nx+3(x+4)&=12 \\\\\nx+3x+12 &= 12 \\\\\n4x &=0 \\\\\nx &=0\n\\end{align*} Thus, $y=4$, and the intersection point is (0,4). Let the base of the triangle be the side of the triangle on the $x$-axis. Because this side is between the points (-4,0) and (12,0), its length is $12-(-4)=12+4=16$. The height must be perpendicular to this side and through the final vertex. This is along the $y$-axis. Thus, the height of the triangle is just the $y$-coordinate of the other point, which is 4. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 16 \\cdot 4=8 \\cdot 4=\\boxed{32} \\text{sq units}$."
