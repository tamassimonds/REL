    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem of finding the least positive integer in the arithmetic sequence: \\(1000, ~987, ~974, ~961, \\ldots\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst impressions: This looks like a straightforward arithmetic sequence problem. We are given a sequence where each term seems to be decreasing by the same amount. My first task is to identify the pattern or rule governing this sequence.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Sequence's Characteristics\nLet\u2019s explore the difference between consecutive terms.\n\n- The difference between the first and second term: \\(987 - 1000 = -13\\).\n- The difference between the second and third term: \\(974 - 987 = -13\\).\n\nAh, I see. The sequence decreases by 13 each time. This confirms it\u2019s an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of \\(-13\\).\n\n### Step 3: Formula of an Arithmetic Sequence\nNow that I know the common difference, I\u2019ll use the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(a_1 = 1000\\) (the first term),\n- \\(d = -13\\) (the common difference).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Least Positive Term\nI need the least positive integer, so it's critical to find the first \\(n\\) such that \\(a_n > 0\\). Let's set up the inequality:\n\n\\[\na_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d > 0\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(a_1\\) and \\(d\\):\n\n\\[\n1000 + (n-1) \\cdot (-13) > 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify and solve for \\(n\\):\n\n\\[\n1000 - 13(n-1) > 0 \\\\\n1000 - 13n + 13 > 0 \\\\\n1013 > 13n \\\\\nn < \\frac{1013}{13}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\(\\frac{1013}{13}\\):\n\n- Performing the division: \\(1013 \\div 13 = 77.923...\\). \n\nThe smallest integer \\(n\\) must be 78 to keep \\(a_n > 0\\).\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the 78th Term\nLet's verify by calculating \\(a_{78}\\):\n\n\\[\na_{78} = 1000 + (78-1) \\cdot (-13) \\\\\na_{78} = 1000 + 77 \\cdot (-13) \\\\\na_{78} = 1000 - 1001 \\\\\na_{78} = -1\n\\]\n\nHmm. Looks like I made a mistake, since \\(-1\\) is not positive. Let's go back and reassess.\nI see that I calculated \\(n < 77.923\\), and used \\(n=78\\) which is incorrect, it should've been \\(n=77\\) instead given the result is still negative, should've tried less. Let's see now that \\(n=77\\) is it positive:\n\n\\[\na_{77} = 1000 + (77-1) \\cdot (-13) \\\\\na_{77} = 1000 + 76 \\cdot (-13) \\\\\na_{77} = 1000 - 988 \\\\\na_{77} = 12\n\\]\n\nPerfect! The smallest positive term appears to be \\(12\\), and this indeed satisfies \\(12 > 0\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nReflecting on the process, verifying each step was crucial because relying solely on calculations without interpreting them accurately led to a mistake. Finally, the least positive integer in the sequence is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The common difference in this arithmetic sequence is $987 - 1000= -13$, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in this sequence is $1000 - 13(n - 1) = 1013 - 13n$.  This expression is positive if and only if $1013 - 13n > 0$, or \\[n < \\frac{1013}{13} = 77 + \\frac{12}{13}.\\] Since $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \\le 77$.  Hence, the least positive integer in this sequence corresponds to the value $n = 77$, in which case $1013 - 13n = 1013 - 13 \\cdot 77 = \\boxed{12}$."
