    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem together. The question is: What is the value of \\(6 + (8 \\div 2)\\)?\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- This problem involves a combination of addition and division.\n- I notice that there\u2019s an operation inside the parentheses. Hmm, parentheses usually suggest that I need to solve that part first. When I see problems like this, it reminds me of the BODMAS/BIDMAS rule, which tells me the order in which to perform operations: Brackets, Orders (i.e., powers and roots), Division and Multiplication (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right).\n\n**Plan of Attack:**\n- Start with the operation inside the brackets.\n- Then, perform the addition.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1. **Handle the Division Inside Parentheses:**\n   - Look inside the parentheses first. I see \\(8 \\div 2\\).\n   - Hmm, division should be straightforward here. Dividing 8 by 2 gives me 4.\n   - Let me double-check: \\(8 \\div 2 = 4\\). Yep, that feels right. No errors there.\n\n2. **Substitute Back into the Expression:**\n   - Now replace \\(8 \\div 2\\) with 4, as I've calculated.\n   - The expression now looks like \\(6 + 4\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Addition:**\n   - Okay, adding these two numbers should be simple.\n   - \\(6 + 4 = 10\\).\n\n**Reflecting on the Process:**\n- Going step by step felt smooth\u2014no surprises here.\n- Everything checks out since I followed the proper order of operations.\n- These small checks throughout ensured I didn\u2019t stray along the wrong path.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The final value of the expression \\(6 + (8 \\div 2)\\) is 10.\n\nI hope my thought process captured a bit of everything I went through, like realizing the application of the order of operations and confirming the division result before moving on. It\u2019s good to take it slow and review my steps to prevent silly mistakes!",
