    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I want to capture my thought process as naturally as I would solve it mentally.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nThis problem involves three equations: \\(a^2 = bc\\), \\(a + b + c = abc\\), and we're trying to find the smallest possible value of \\(a^2\\). The conditions given are quite symmetric in nature, which suggests to me that maybe there is a symmetry or a neat value for these variables. \n\nInitially, this reminds me of a problem involving AM-GM inequality or possibly a clever substitution since we are looking for a minimum value. There might be a standard trick, using symmetry or setting all variables equal could work here. I need to explore the interactions of these equations more deeply.\n\n**Check if Equal Values Work:**\n\nLet's start by assuming symmetry, since \\( a^2 = bc \\) suggests there could be a relationship when we assume \\(a = b = c\\). \n\n1. If \\(a = b = c\\), then:\n\n   \\(a^2 = a \\cdot a = a^2\\) (This doesn't give us information - so it holds.)\n   \n   Substituting in the second equation:\n   \n   \\(3a = a^3\\)\n   \n   Solving gives: \\(a^3 = 3a\\), or \\(a(a^2 - 3) = 0\\).\n   \n   Since \\(a = 0\\) is not possible (as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) are positive), we have \\(a^2 = 3\\).\n\n2. If \\(a^2 = 3\\), then this means \\(b = c = a = \\sqrt{3}\\). Let's check if that satisfies both conditions:\n\n   \\(a^2 = bc\\) holds since \\((\\sqrt{3})^2 = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}\\).\n   \n   \\(a + b + c = abc\\) simplifies to:\n   \n   \\(3\\sqrt{3} = (\\sqrt{3})^3 = 3\\sqrt{3}\\).\n   \n   Both conditions are met. This works!\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe symmetrical choice \\(a = b = c\\) led us to a possible solution quickly. Let's consider if there might be smaller values for \\(a^2\\) by considering different expressions for \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). But given how the equality plead nicely under symmetry, it's quite likely this is the optimal configuration due to the nature of squared and cubic interactions. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter working through, it seems like the smallest possible value of \\(a^2\\) is indeed \\(3\\). Using symmetry worked out beautifully. It feels satisfying because both expressions behave perfectly under such a symmetric assumption which is often a strong sign in such questions.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe smallest possible value of \\(a^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{3}\\). \n\nReflecting upon the solution, using symmetry first often helps simplify the problem significantly when variables are symmetric in nature given conditions like \\(a^2 = bc\\).",
