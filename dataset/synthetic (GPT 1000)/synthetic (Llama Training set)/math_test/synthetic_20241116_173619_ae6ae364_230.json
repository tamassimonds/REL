    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem of finding the \\(x\\)-coordinate for the \\(x\\)-intercept of the line containing the points \\((7,4)\\) and \\((6,3)\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Brainstorming\n\nFirst, when I see this problem, I recognize that it is essentially asking me to find where the line that passes through these two points crosses the \\(x\\)-axis. The \\(x\\)-intercept occurs when \\(y=0\\), which gives us a lead on what we need to find.\n\nThe problem involves a straight line through two points, so there\u2019s the possibility of using the slope-intercept form (\\(y=mx+b\\)) or the point-slope form of a line to find the equation and then solve for \\(x\\) when \\(y=0\\).\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n1. **Find the slope of the line**: This is the first clear step. We can calculate the slope (\\(m\\)) using the formula:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Equation of the line**: Once we have the slope, I can use the point-slope form \\(y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)\\) because it\u2019s straightforward with given points.\n\n3. **Find the \\(x\\)-intercept**: Set \\(y = 0\\) in the line's equation and solve for \\(x\\).\n\nOkay, let's follow through with these steps.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the slope\n\nUsing the given points \\((7, 4)\\) and \\((6, 3)\\):\n\\[\nm = \\frac{3 - 4}{6 - 7} = \\frac{-1}{-1} = 1\n\\]\n\nThis slope \\(m = 1\\) makes sense because both \\(\\frac{-1}{-1}\\) equals 1. So I\u2019m confident in this calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Equation of the line\n\nNow, I'll use the point-slope form with point \\((7, 4)\\):\n\\[\ny - 4 = 1(x - 7)\n\\]\nSimplifying, I get:\n\\[\ny - 4 = x - 7 \\implies y = x - 3\n\\]\n\nJust to double-check, I can verify if this equation holds for the other point \\((6, 3)\\). Plugging in \\(x = 6\\), I get:\n\\[\ny = 6 - 3 = 3\n\\]\nYes, it works! Now I\u2019m more confident with the equation \\(y = x - 3\\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the x-intercept\n\nSet \\(y = 0\\):\n\\[\n0 = x - 3\n\\]\nSolving for \\(x\\), I find:\n\\[\nx = 3\n\\]\n\n### Verification\n\nQuickly reflecting: the steps make sense given what we've outlined. The calculations align with my understanding, and the final result \\(x = 3\\) feels correct. The logic flows from defining the problem to obtaining the line equation and finally solving for \\(x\\) when \\(y = 0\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe \\(x\\)-coordinate of the \\(x\\)-intercept is \\(\\boxed{3}\\). Checking the solution through a few angles reassures me that this approach and result are sound.",

  "ground_truth": "First we find that the slope of the line is $\\frac{4 - 3}{7 - 6} = 1$.  Now, for any other point, $P = (x, y)$, to be on this line, the slope between $P$ and either of $(7, 4)$ or $(6, 3)$ must be equal to 1.  Thus $\\frac{y - 3}{x - 6} = 1 \\Rightarrow y = x - 3$.  A line crosses the $x$-axis when it has $y = 0$.  Plugging this in for our line we get $0 = x - 3 \\Rightarrow x = \\boxed{3}$."
