    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle the problem \\(32^2 - 18^2\\). At first glance, this looks like it could be a difference of squares problem. \n\n### Step 1: Recognize Patterns\nFirst thoughts: \"This reminds me of the difference of squares formula. I think it's \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\). Let's confirm this.\"\n\nLet's re-examine the formula:\n- The difference of squares formula states that \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\).\n- Here, \\(a = 32\\) and \\(b = 18\\).\n\nThis approach seems promising because it simplifies dealing with larger numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Difference of Squares Formula\nBased on the formula:\n- \\(a - b = 32 - 18\\)\n- \\(a + b = 32 + 18\\)\n\nCalculate these:\n- \\(a - b = 32 - 18 = 14\\)\n- \\(a + b = 32 + 18 = 50\\)\n\nNow substitute back into the formula:\n\\[\n32^2 - 18^2 = (32 - 18)(32 + 18) = 14 \\times 50\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Product\nNext, let's calculate \\(14 \\times 50\\):\n- Start with simpler calculations: \\(14 \\times 50 = 700\\).\n\nThis number feels right because it's a manageable multiplication outcome from what we expect.\n\n### Step 4: Verification\nVerification step: \"Okay, let's make sure everything seems consistent.\"\n- I checked that \\(32^2 - 18^2\\) started as a difference of squares, which is appropriate for the method used.\n- I performed calculations for smaller parts first to minimize errors and managed them successfully without complications.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nThe calculated result for the expression \\(32^2 - 18^2\\) using the difference of squares formula is \\(700\\).\n\nReflecting: \"This feels right. I don't see any errors in the usage of formula or calculations. Nice, I think I nailed it.\"\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{700}\\).",
