    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving \\(36^{10} \\div 6^{19}\\). I\u2019ll start by jotting down my initial thoughts and then explore some strategies to find the solution.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nThe problem asks us to divide \\(36^{10}\\) by \\(6^{19}\\). Immediately, I notice both numbers have bases that are multiples of 6. My first thought is to express these numbers in terms of their prime factors to make the division easier. \n\n### Brainstorming Strategy\n1. **Express each number in terms of its prime factors:** \n   - I know that \\(36\\) can be rewritten as \\(6^2\\) because \\(36 = 6 \\times 6\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(36^{10}\\) becomes \\((6^2)^{10}\\).\n\n2. **Simplify using properties of exponents:** \n   - It\u2019s helpful to recall that \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n}\\). \n   - So, \\((6^2)^{10}\\) simplifies to \\(6^{20}\\).\n\n3. **Revisiting the division equation:**\n   - Now the expression looks like \\(6^{20} \\div 6^{19}\\).\n\n### Calculating the Result\n1. **Subtract the exponents:** \n   - I remember the property \\(\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\\) for any positive number \\(a\\).\n   - Applying this, I find \\(6^{20} \\div 6^{19}\\) simplifies to \\(6^{20-19} = 6^1 = 6\\).\n\n### Reflect on the Solution\n- **Check the consistency of calculations:** \n  - Alright, stepping through it all again: breaking down \\(36\\) into \\(6^2\\) feels correct. \n  - Translating powers like \\((6^2)^{10} = 6^{20}\\) checks out.\n  - Simplifying \\(6^{20} \\div 6^{19}\\) through exponent subtraction aligns with my understanding of algebraic rules.\n\n### Conclusion\n- My final result is \\(6\\).\n- Everything seems to fit perfectly. I've gone through the properties of exponents carefully and checked each transformation of the problem to ensure there weren\u2019t any missteps.\n\nThat's it! I\u2019ve noted my reflections and processes, ensuring that my approach was coherent at each stage.",

  "ground_truth": "Properties of exponents allow us to simplify exponential expressions like this one that are much more difficult to calculate outright. We can use the power of a power property to rewrite $36^{10} = (6^2)^{10} = 6^{20}$, which gives us \\[36^{10} \\div 6^{19} = 6^{20} \\div 6^{19}.\\]The quotient of powers property tells us that \\[6^{20} \\div 6^{19}= 6^{20-19} = 6^1 = \\boxed{6}.\\]"
