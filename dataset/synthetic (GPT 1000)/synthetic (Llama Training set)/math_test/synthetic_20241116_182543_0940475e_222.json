  "problem": "Emily has a bag which contains only blue and green marbles.  She knows that the ratio of green marbles to blue marbles in the bag is $3$ to $1$ and that the bag contains a total of $60$ marbles.  How many of the marbles in the bag are blue?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- The problem is asking about ratios, so it seems similar to problems dealing with proportions or parts of a whole. \n- We know there are two types of marbles (blue and green) and we also know the total count is 60.\n- Initially, the key details are the ratio of green to blue marbles (3 to 1) and the total number of marbles (60). \n- This sounds like a problem of splitting a total amount into parts according to a given ratio.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Use a Part-Whole Relationship Approach:**\n   - The ratio 3:1 can be interpreted as \"for every 3 green marbles, there's 1 blue marble.\"\n   - Given the total is 60, maybe there's a way to directly relate these parts to this total.\n\n2. **Equation Setup Approach:**\n   - Since there is a total number of marbles, perhaps another approach would be to use variable expressions to denote the number of marbles and solve for them.\n   - Let's say we denote the number of blue marbles as \\( b \\) and, since the ratio is 3:1, the number of green marbles as \\( 3b \\).\n\n**First Strategy Execution: Part-Whole Relationship:**\n- Since the ratio is 3 to 1, effectively every \"set\" of marbles consists of 4 marbles (3 green and 1 blue).\n- If we divide the total number of marbles, 60, by this 4-marble set, we should find out how many such sets there are in the bag.\n\n\\[\n60 \\div (3+1) = 60 \\div 4 = 15\n\\]\n\n- So, there are 15 sets of these 4 marbles. Each set consists of 1 blue marble. Therefore, the number of blue marbles would be 15.\n\n**Check This Approach:**\n- Calculate the number of green marbles: 15 sets \u00d7 3 green marbles per set = 45 green marbles.\n- Add both values to confirm: 15 (blue) + 45 (green) = 60 marbles in total, which matches the given total.\n\n**Second Strategy Execution: Equation Setup:**\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of blue marbles.\n- Then \\( 3b \\) will be the number of green marbles because of the 3:1 ratio.\n- We can use an equation with the total:\n\n\\[\nb + 3b = 60\n\\]\n\\[\n4b = 60\n\\]\n\\[\nb = 60 \\div 4 = 15 \n\\]\n\n- So, using this approach, we again find there are 15 blue marbles.\n\n**Check This Approach:**\n- Again, calculate the number of green marbles using \\( 3b \\), which is \\( 3 \\times 15 = 45 \\).\n- Add both: 15 + 45 = 60. Again confirms the total matches.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nBoth approaches provided consistent results: there are 15 blue marbles in Emily's bag. The problem felt familiar once the ratio was broken down into sets, and the confirmation came from seeing that both tactical approaches lined up seamlessly.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the ratio of green to blue marbles is $3$ to $1$, this means that for every $3$ green marbles there is $1$ blue marble and thus only $1$ out of every $4$ marbles in the bag is blue.  Thus the total number of blue marbles in the bag is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times 60=\\boxed{15}$"
