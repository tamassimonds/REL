That seems like a hint about the nature of the number.\n\n### Calculating \\(\\sqrt{196}\\)\n- The expression \\(\\sqrt{196}\\) can be simplified by determining the square root of 196.\n- I know that 14 squared is 196 because \\(14 \\times 14 = 196\\). So, \\(\\sqrt{196} = 14\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Okay, I think this is a good start. Now, my task shifts to finding the factors of 14.\n\n### Finding the Factors of 14\n- Factors of a number are numbers that divide it without a remainder.\n- I'll list them: I know from basic multiplication facts that factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14.\n  - 1 and 14 because \\(1 \\times 14 = 14\\)\n  - 2 and 7 because \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\)\n\n**Check:**\n- I should check that I didn't miss anything. I\u2019ve listed four factors, and, facing tight constraints, it's pertinent to ensure completeness.\n\n### Summing the Factors\n- Now that I have verified that the factors are correct, I\u2019ll calculate their sum.\n- Sum of these factors: \\(1 + 2 + 7 + 14\\).\n\n**Calculating:**\n- \\(1 + 2 = 3\\)\n- \\(3 + 7 = 10\\)\n- \\(10 + 14 = 24\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The summation seems correct; I added each step carefully.\n- The sum of the four positive factors of 14 is 24.\n\n### Final Wrap-up\n- I looked at each step to ensure consistency and correctness. Everything checks out.\n- My result was reached through:\n  - Correct calculation of \\(\\sqrt{196}\\)\n  - Accurate determination and listing of factors\n  - Verification of arithmetic for the summation process\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe sum of the four positive factors of \\(\\sqrt{196}\\), which is 14, is 24.\n\nI explored, calculated carefully, and ensured through checks that there were no errors or oversights in my process. This orderliness gives me confidence in the conclusion.",
