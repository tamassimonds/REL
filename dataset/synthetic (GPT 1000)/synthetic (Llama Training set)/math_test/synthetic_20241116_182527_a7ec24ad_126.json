    "working_out": "First thoughts: When I see the problem of dividing a polynomial by another, I immediately think of polynomial long division. But, polynomial division can sometimes be quite complex, especially with higher powers. Another strategy that comes to mind is thinking about how the polynomial evaluates at the roots of the divisor, in this case \\(x^2 - 1\\). The roots here are \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -1\\). Evaluating a polynomial at these points might help.\n\nReflections: Let's see\u2014bringing in properties at the roots is often a key strategy because the remainder, when dividing by a polynomial of degree \\(n\\), is a polynomial of degree less than \\(n\\). For \\(x^2 - 1\\), that means the remainder can be written as \\(ax + b\\). Evaluating the original polynomial at these roots might help determine \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nHmm, this reminds me of some previous tasks where finding a pattern at the roots quickly led to a solution. Let's try evaluating at \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -1\\).\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the polynomial \\(P(x) = x + x^3 + x^9 + x^{27} + x^{81} + x^{243}\\) at \\(x = 1\\).\n- \\(P(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\\).\n- Reflection: The result is very straightforward. For \\(x = 1\\), all the powers collapse to 1, which is a neat simplification.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate \\(P(x)\\) at \\(x = -1\\).\n- Consider the behavior: \\(P(-1) = -1 + (-1)^3 + (-1)^9 + (-1)^{27} + (-1)^{81} + (-1)^{243}\\).\n- All terms have odd exponents, so \\(P(-1) = -1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = -6\\).\n- Reflection: That's interesting! We get \\(-6\\) for \\(x = -1\\). Each negative maintains its negative sign.\n\nStep 3: Determine \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) for the remainder \\(rx + b\\).\n- At \\(x = 1\\), the remainder should equal 6, so \\(a(1) + b = 6\\).\n- At \\(x = -1\\), the remainder should equal \\(-6\\), so \\(a(-1) + b = -6\\).\n\nNow, solve these equations:\n- From \\(a + b = 6\\) and \\(-a + b = -6\\),\n- Add them together: \\(2b = 0 \\Rightarrow b = 0\\).\n- Substitute back into \\(a + b = 6\\): \\(a = 6\\).\n\nAha moments: It worked out pretty neatly\u2014much smoother than expected. The remainder is precisely \\(6x\\).\n\nFinal thoughts: Yes, I believe the approach is correct. Evaluating at roots, reflecting on results, then solving for coefficients matched typical techniques. The remainder when \\(x + x^3 + x^9 + x^{27} + x^{81} + x^{243}\\) is divided by \\(x^2 - 1\\) is indeed \\(6x\\).\n\nAnswer: The remainder is \\(6x\\).",
