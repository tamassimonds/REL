    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with some initial thoughts and brainstorm.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, we're given that \\(\\omega^{1997} = 1\\) and \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\). This tells us that \\(\\omega\\) is a root of unity. It seems important to note that \\(\\omega\\) is actually a primitive 1997th root of unity. This means \\(\\omega\\) is a complex number on the unit circle (in the complex plane) such that its 1997th power returns to 1, and \\(\\omega\\) is not an integer multiple (other than 1997 itself) root of unity.\n\nWe need to evaluate the sum:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^{1997}}.\n\\]\n\nThis kind of looks familiar. Maybe something involving telescoping series or symmetry of roots could help. But I\u2019ll dive deeper to get a closer idea of handling this form.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring the Expression\n\nSince \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive root, the sum of all powers of \\(\\omega\\) from \\(\\omega^0\\) to \\(\\omega^{1996}\\) is zero:\n\\[ \n1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\cdots + \\omega^{1996} = 0.\n\\]\nLet's check a useful equation transformation and see:\n\nFor the term \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k}\\), consider this:\n\\[ \n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k} = \\frac{1}{1 - (-\\omega^k)} = \\frac{1 - \\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} - \\dots }{1}.\n\\]\n\nThough direct transformation like above seems complex, let\u2019s simplify differently:\n\nSuppose, multiply each term by \\(1 - \\omega^k\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k} \\times (1 - \\omega^k) = 1 - \\omega^k.\n\\]\nThis simplifies directly in a cleaner way granting us:\n\\[ \n1 = \\frac{1 - \\omega^k}{1 + \\omega^k}.\n\\]\n\nThus rearranging gives a tangible idea: \\(1 + \\omega^k\\) holds some natural symmetry we can utilize.\n\n### Step 3: Rethink: Sum of Reciprocal\n\nLet's re-evaluate using complementary roots and simplification:\n\\[ \n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^{-k}}.\n\\]\n\nNotice how \\(\\frac{1}{1 + z} + \\frac{1}{1 + z^{-1}} = 1\\).\n\nEach pair of \\(\\omega^k\\) and \\(\\omega^{1997-k}\\) pairs complements every cycle like above. Thus,\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{1996} \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k} = \\sum_{k=1}^{998} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^{-k}} \\right) = 999.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Verify with Integer Roots\n\nReassuring consistency triggers in restructuring such symmetric and cyclical arrangements in roots.\nThus:\n\\[\n\\boxed{998}\n\\]\n\nThis final sum due to symmetry in each pair thus rounds correctly to \\(999 - 1\\) after revisiting unity symmetry as every included term collectively reaches zero except initial exclusion.\n\nThis was insightful in verifying foundational root behaviour of complex forms.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous attempt. Let's take a step back and re-evaluate this problem with fresh insight. I realize now that the interplay between the terms \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k}\\) was not properly handled, especially concerning their symmetries. \n\n### Reflecting on the Problem\n\nPreviously, I attempted to simplify directly but missed the structured insight provided by the nature of \\(\\omega\\) as a root of unity. Given \\(\\omega^{1997} = 1\\) and \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\), \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 1997th root of unity. This implies:\n\n\\[ \n1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\cdots + \\omega^{1996} = 0.\n\\] \n\nNow, let's use this known property to explore a better approach.\n\n### Revisiting with a Pairing Strategy\n\nLet's consider the terms \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k}\\) and explore how they interact in pairs. Notice that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^{1997-k}}.\n\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten using the identity:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + z} + \\frac{1}{1 + z^{-1}} = 1.\n\\]\n\nFor terms \\(z = \\omega^k\\) and \\(z^{-1} = \\omega^{1997-k}\\), we observe:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k} + \\frac{\\omega^k}{\\omega^k + 1} = 1.\n\\]\n\nEach pair thereby sums to 1. Let's explicitly consider the sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{1996} \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies, recognizing the structure to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{998} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^{1997-k}} \\right) = 998.\n\\]\n\nEach of these terms sums to 1, as expected. \n\n### Correcting the Overlooked Term\n\nHowever, I overlooked the term \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^{1997}}\\). Since \\(\\omega^{1997} = 1\\), this becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThus, adding this to the sum gives:\n\n\\[ \n998 + \\frac{1}{2} = 998.5.\n\\]\n\nSo, the corrected and verified sum is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1997}{2}}.\n\\]\n\nThis fresh evaluation, emphasizing symmetry and the property of roots of unity, correctly delivers the desired result.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous attempt.
