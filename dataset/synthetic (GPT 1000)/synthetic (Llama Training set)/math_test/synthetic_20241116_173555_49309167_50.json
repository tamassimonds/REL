  "problem": "Elodie is putting on a fashion show and has five fabulous outfits for her five fabulous fashion models. However, on the day of the show, two of the outfits were ruined in an unfortunate permanent marker incident. Regardless, the show must go on and the remaining outfits will be presented. If each outfit can only be worn by one model and there is no time for any model to wear more than one dress, how many different shows can Elodie put on? (Note: Two shows are considered the same if they contain the same models wearing the same dresses.)",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. My first thought is that this is a classic permutation or combination problem. We're dealing with a situation where we have fewer outfits than models, and each outfit must be uniquely assigned to a model. Let's explore the problem in more detail:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nWe have five models and five outfits initially. Due to the marker incident, two outfits were ruined, so we have only three outfits left. We need to assign these three outfits to three different models. First, this looks like a permutation problem because the order of outfits matters (each model gets a unique outfit).\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorm Potential Approaches\n\n1. **Permutations**: Calculate the permutation of three outfits among the five models.\n2. **Factorials**: Think in terms of factorials since we're determining specific placements.\n3. **Combinatorics**: Consider combinations if we were somehow selecting models instead (though initially seems less relevant here).\n4. **Logical pairing**: Just a simple logical enumeration of possibilities by choosing models and outfits.\n\nThe permutation approach seems most fitting initially because it's about arranging the three outfits for whatever selection of three models.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Permutations\n\nWe need to select 3 models out of 5, and then assign the 3 outfits to those 3 models.\n\n1. **Choose 3 models from 5**: This is a combination problem.\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n   \\]\n   So, there are 10 different ways to choose 3 models out of 5.\n\n2. **Allocate 3 outfits to 3 chosen models**: This is a permutation of 3 items.\n   \\[\n   3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Calculations\n\nFor each way of choosing 3 models, there are 6 ways to assign outfits to these models. Thus, the total number of different shows Elodie can put on is:\n\\[\n10 \\text{ (ways to choose models)} \\times 6 \\text{ (ways to assign outfits)} = 60\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Reflect and Double-Check the Calculation\n\nLet's review the logic:\n- We're correctly choosing 3 models out of 5.\n- We're then permuting the 3 outfits among these 3 models, which logically should give us the correct number.\n\nQuick double-check with example: Let's say we choose a specific set of models like Model A, B, C. Permutations of outfits, say X, Y, Z for these models: XYZ, XZY, YXZ, YZX, ZXY, ZYX \u2013 confirms 6 permutations.\n\nFinal confirmation: I checked the logic, the calculations, and potential pitfalls. Everything aligns correctly. Therefore, the total number of different shows Elodie can put on is **60**.",

  "ground_truth": "Since two of the outfits are ruined, we only have three outfits. There are five models available for the first outfit, four models available for the second outfit, and three models available for the third outfit. Therefore, there are $5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{60}$ ways in which the models can be matched to the outfits."
