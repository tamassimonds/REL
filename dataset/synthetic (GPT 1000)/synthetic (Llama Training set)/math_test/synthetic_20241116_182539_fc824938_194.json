    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, exploring different strategies and reflecting on their effectiveness as we go.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nWe've got three equations with three variables:\n\n1. \\(x + y - z = -8\\)\n2. \\(x - y + z = 18\\)\n3. \\(-x + y + z = 30\\)\n\nOur goal is to find the product \\(xyz\\). \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nThe given system of equations reminds me of solving simultaneous equations. Typically, we'd use substitution or elimination here. Maybe if we can solve for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) individually, we can find their product. But before diving into one method, let's consider some strategies:\n\n- **Elimination:** We might eliminate one variable stepwise by adding or subtracting the equations.\n- **Substitution:** Solve one of the equations for a single variable then substitute into the others.\n- **Symmetry or patterns:** The equations have a sort of symmetry; maybe there's a shortcut if we look holistically.\n\nI'll start with elimination since we have a consistent balance of each variable in each equation.\n\n### Step 2: Attempt Elimination\n\nFirst, let's try eliminating one of the variables from the equations by adding two equations together:\n\n- Adding equations (1) and (2):\n\n  \\[\n  (x + y - z) + (x - y + z) = -8 + 18\n  \\]\n\n  This simplifies to:\n\n  \\[\n  2x = 10 \\implies x = 5\n  \\]\n\n  Nice, \\(x = 5\\)! That's promising.\n\n### Step 3: Solving for Other Variables\n\nHaving found \\(x = 5\\), let's substitute it back into equations (1) and (2) to find the other variables.\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 5\\) into Equation (1):\n\n\\[ \n5 + y - z = -8 \\implies y - z = -13 \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)} \n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 5\\) into Equation (2):\n\n\\[\n5 - y + z = 18 \\implies -y + z = 13 \\quad \\text{(Equation 5)}\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two new equations:\n\n- \\(y - z = -13\\)\n- \\(-y + z = 13\\)\n\n### Step 4: Further Elimination\n\nAdd Equations (4) and (5) to eliminate \\(y\\) and \\(z\\):\n\n\\[\n(y - z) + (-y + z) = -13 + 13 \n\\]\n\nSimplifies to:\n\n\\[\n0 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis leaves us no new information. Hmm, let's try a different approach with these two equations. Solving for \\(y\\) and \\(z\\):\n\nFrom Equation (4):\n\n\\[\ny = z - 13\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(y = z - 13\\) into Equation (5):\n\n\\[\n-(z - 13) + z = 13 \\implies -z + 13 + z = 13\n\\]\n\nAgain, this simplifies to \\(13 = 13\\), meaning it's consistent for any \\(z\\) and doesn't uniquely determine \\(y\\) or \\(z\\).\n\n### Reflection and Insight\n\nBoth equations reduce to tautologies (\\(13 = 13\\)), indicating dependency\u2014we've confirmed there might be infinitely many solutions due to linear dependency. But because of the structure, it suggests the dependency allows us to express one in terms of another consistently.\n\n### Step 5: Solve Using Third Equation\n\nGoing back to the original system, use another arrangement:\n\n- Substitute \\(x = 5\\) into the third original equation \\(-x + y + z = 30\\):\n\n\\[\n-5 + y + z = 30 \\implies y + z = 35 \\quad \\text{(Equation 6)}\n\\]\n\nCombining Equation (4), \\(y - z = -13\\), with Equation (6), \\(y + z = 35\\):\n\nAdd these:\n\n\\[\n(y - z) + (y + z) = -13 + 35 \n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ \n2y = 22 \\implies y = 11 \n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(y = 11\\) back into Equation (6):\n\n\\[\n11 + z = 35 \\implies z = 24\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Product\n\nHaving \\(x = 5\\), \\(y = 11\\), \\(z = 24\\), find the product:\n\n\\[ \nxyz = 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 24\n\\]\n\nCarry out the calculations:\n\n\\[\n5 \\cdot 11 = 55\n\\]\n\n\\[\n55 \\cdot 24 = 1320\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe product \\(xyz\\) is \\(1320\\). After working through several steps and verifying, it seems everything lines up correctly based on the relationships we've unravelled in the system.",

  "ground_truth": "Noticing that the left-hand sides are symmetric in $x$, $y$, and $z$ (in that any relabelling of the variables leads to one of the given left-hand sides), we sum all three equations to obtain $x+y+z=40$. Subtracting the first equation from $x+y+z=40$ gives $2z=48\\implies z=24$. Similarly, subtracting the second equation from $x+y+z=40$ gives $y=11$. Finally, subtracting the third equation from $x+y+z=40$ gives $x=5$ so that $xyz=(5)(11)(24)=\\boxed{1320}$."
