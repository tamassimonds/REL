    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem! This is a classic inequality problem where we're asked to find the sum of integers that satisfy a specific condition.\n\n### First Impressions:\n- The problem involves a range of values for the fraction \\(\\frac{k}{27}\\).\n- We need to work with inequalities here.\n- We're looking for integer values of \\(k\\), which bounds how they relate to \\(27\\) when expressed as fractions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the Inequality Range\nWe're given:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} < \\frac{k}{27} < \\frac{8}{9}\n\\]\n\nImmediately, my brain thinks, \"Okay, let's first isolate \\(k\\) in this inequality.\" This involves manipulating these fractions so that \\(k\\) stands alone.\n\n#### Step 2: Solve for \\(k\\)\nLet's separate the inequalities for clarity and solve each one individually to isolate \\(k\\).\n\n**For \\(\\frac{2}{3} < \\frac{k}{27}\\):**\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} < \\frac{k}{27} \n\\]\nMultiply both sides by 27 to clear the fraction:\n\\[\n27 \\times \\frac{2}{3} < k \n\\]\nCalculating the left side:\n\\[\n18 < k \n\\]\nSo, \\(k\\) must be greater than 18.\n\n**For \\(\\frac{k}{27} < \\frac{8}{9}\\):**\n\\[\n\\frac{k}{27} < \\frac{8}{9}\n\\]\nAgain, multiply both sides by 27:\n\\[\nk < 27 \\times \\frac{8}{9}\n\\]\nCalculate the right side:\n\\[\nk < 24 \n\\]\n\n#### Step 3: Combine the Inequalities\nNow we combine both results:\n\\[\n18 < k < 24\n\\]\n\nThis means \\(k\\) must be the integers 19, 20, 21, 22, or 23.\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate the Sum\nNow, we need to calculate the sum of these integers:\n\\[\n19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 \n\\]\nLet's double-check that - sometimes, manually adding can catch simplest mistakes:\n- \\(19 + 20 = 39\\)\n- \\(39 + 21 = 60\\)\n- \\(60 + 22 = 82\\)\n- \\(82 + 23 = 105\\)\n\nThus, the sum is \\(105\\).\n\n### Final Check:\nReflecting on the arithmetic and the problem setup: Each value of \\(k\\) satisfies both original inequalities. Everything appears consistent.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIt all flows well logically, and calculating twice gave consistent results; therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{105}\n\\]\n\nThat\u2019s it! As each necessary step is rechecked, from deriving inequalities to simple arithmetic, the solution holds steady. Always worthwhile to double-check for any overlooked assumptions, but this all appears solid.",

  "ground_truth": "In symbols, we want the sum of the positive integers $k$ such that $$\\dfrac23 < \\dfrac k{27} < \\dfrac89.$$ Multiplying the expressions in these inequalities by $27$, we have $$18 < k < 24.$$ The integer solutions are thus $k = 19,20,21,22,23$, which add up to $5\\cdot 21 = \\boxed{105}$."
