    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem. At its heart, we need to find the largest number \\( k \\) less than 1000 such that when \\( k \\) is divided by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, the remainder is always 1. \n\n**First Thoughts and Strategy Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Understanding the Problem:** The condition that \"the remainder is 1 when divided by each of these numbers\" points towards a kind of congruence relation. This sounds like we need to work with some sort of modular arithmetic.\n\n- **Similar Problems:** This reminds me of the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). However, in this simpler case, perhaps I don\u2019t need the full machinery of the CRT. Instead, I can take the least common multiple (LCM) and adjust from there.\n\n- **Approach with LCM:** Since the remainder is 1 in each division, \\( k - 1 \\) should be divisible by each of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. That means \\( k - 1 \\) is a common multiple of these numbers. A quick approach is to find the LCM of these numbers to see conditions for \\( k - 1\\).\n\n**Now, let's Calculate the LCM of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7:**\n\n- **Prime Factorization:**\n  - 3 is \\( 3^1 \\)\n  - 4 is \\( 2^2 \\)\n  - 5 is \\( 5^1 \\)\n  - 6 is \\( 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\)\n  - 7 is \\( 7^1 \\)\n\n- **LCM Calculation:** Take the highest power of each prime:\n  - Maximum \\( 2^2 \\) from 4,\n  - Maximum \\( 3^1 \\) from 3 or 6,\n  - Maximum \\( 5^1 \\) from 5,\n  - Maximum \\( 7^1 \\) from 7.\n\n  Thus, the LCM is \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\).\n\nLet's calculate that step-by-step:\n\\[ 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\]\n\\[ 12 \\times 5 = 60 \\]\n\\[ 60 \\times 7 = 420 \\]\n\n**Reflecting on the LCM:** \\( k - 1 \\) must be a multiple of 420. Therefore, \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( k = 420n + 1 \\).\n\n**Finding the Largest \\( k \\) less than 1000:**\n\nWe need:\n\\[ 420n + 1 < 1000 \\]\n\\[ 420n < 999 \\]\n\\[ n < \\frac{999}{420} \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\\[ n < \\approx 2.378 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, the largest integer \\( n \\) is 2.\n\n**Calculate \\( k \\) for \\( n = 2 \\):**\n\n\\[ k = 420 \\times 2 + 1 = 840 + 1 = 841 \\]\n\n**Sanity Check:**\n\n- \\( 841 \\div 3 \\rightarrow \\) remainder is 1\n- \\( 841 \\div 4 \\rightarrow \\) remainder is 1\n- \\( 841 \\div 5 \\rightarrow \\) remainder is 1\n- \\( 841 \\div 6 \\rightarrow \\) remainder is 1\n- \\( 841 \\div 7 \\rightarrow \\) remainder is 1\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll checks confirm that 841 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Thus, the largest number \\( k \\) less than 1000 that satisfies all these conditions is **841**. \n\nEverything aligns well; I am confident in this solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We can re-write the requirements of this problem as: \\begin{align*}k &\\equiv1\\pmod{3}\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{4},\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{5},\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{6},\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{7}.\n\\end{align*}In other words, $k-1$ is divisible by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. We have  \\begin{align*}\n\\text{lcm}[3,4,5,6,7] &= \\text{lcm}[3,4,5,7] \\\\\n&= 3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 \\\\&= 420,\n\\end{align*}and thus $k-1$ must be divisible by $420$. The only two multiples of $420$ under $1000$ are $420$ and $840$, so the largest possible value of $k$ is $840+1 = \\boxed{841}$."
