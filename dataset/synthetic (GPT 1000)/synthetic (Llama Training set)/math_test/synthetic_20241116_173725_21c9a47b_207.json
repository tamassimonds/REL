    "working_out": "Alright, I'm taking this one step at a time. Here we go with my initial thoughts:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWhen I first look at the equation \\(441 + 2(21)(19) + 361 = x\\), it seems to be a straightforward algebraic expression. It's essentially a series of operations we need to perform to find \\(x\\).\n\nFirst off, it looks like we're dealing with integer operations: addition and multiplication. That makes me think that this might not be too complex, but I should be careful with my calculations to avoid mistakes.\n\n**Step 2: Breaking Down the Problem**\n\nLet's start by evaluating each part of this expression separately. \n\n- Okay, so we have \\(441\\), which is just itself, nice and simple.\n- Then the term \\(2(21)(19)\\). Here, I'll need to multiply \\(21\\) and \\(19\\) first, then multiply the result by \\(2\\).\n- And finally, \\(361\\).\n\nMy goal is to compute each piece and then sum them all to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Middle Term**\n\nLet's tackle \\(2(21)(19)\\).\n\nFirst, multiply \\(21\\) and \\(19\\):\n\n\\[ \n21 \\times 19 = 399 \n\\]\n\nI know \\(20 \\times 19\\) is \\(380\\), and adding another \\(19\\) gives us \\(399\\), which makes sense. Quick mental check: \\(21\\) is one more than \\(20\\), so this feels right.\n\nNow, multiply the result by \\(2\\):\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 399 = 798\n\\]\n\nAlright, \\(2(21)(19)\\) calculates to \\(798\\).\n\n**Step 4: Adding All the Terms**\n\nNow to sum up all the parts: \\(441\\), \\(798\\), and \\(361\\).\n\n- Add \\(441\\) and \\(361\\) first:\n\n\\[ \n441 + 361 = 802 \n\\]\n\n- Now, add the previous result to \\(798\\):\n\n\\[ \n802 + 798 = 1600 \n\\]\n\nThat's feeling pretty conclusive. But just to ensure:\n\n- Quick check, part by part:\n    - \\(441\\) and \\(361\\) are direct from the problem.\n    - The middle term was verified step by step.\n\n**Step 5: Solution Reflection**\n\nSince each part checked out along the way and no glaring errors appeared, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(x\\) is:\n\n\\[ \n\\boxed{1600} \n\\]\n\nI verified my calculations at each step, and everything seems to line up. I think I took the appropriate steps here: breaking the problem into smaller parts, verifying along the way, and then combining for the final answer. Let me know if you have any other questions or there's something else you'd like to discuss!",

  "ground_truth": "We note that $361=19^2$ and $441=21^2$, so $x=21^2+2(21)(19)+19^2$. This is just the binomial expansion of $(21+19)^2=40^2=\\boxed{1600}$."
