    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\nWhen I see the problem \"Evaluate \\(\\left\\lceil -\\frac{7}{4} \\right\\rceil\\)\", I recognize that the symbol \\(\\left\\lceil \\cdot \\right\\rceil\\) represents the ceiling function. The ceiling function, \\(\\left\\lceil x \\right\\rceil\\), is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(x\\). The task here is to determine which whole number \\(-\\frac{7}{4}\\) rounds up to.\n\nBreak it Down:\n1. **Calculate \\(-\\frac{7}{4}\\)**: This fraction indicates division, so first, I need to carry out \\(-7\\) divided by \\(4\\).  \n   \\[\n   -7 \\div 4 = -1.75\n   \\]\n   Okay, the result is \\(-1.75\\).\n\n2. **Apply the Ceiling Function**: Now that we have \\(-1.75\\), we need to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to this value. I need to think about the number line here. \n\n   - Numbers involved:\n     - \\(-2, -1, 0, \\) and so on.\n     - On the number line, \\(-1.75\\) falls between \\(-2\\) and \\(-1\\).\n     - The ceiling function will pick \\(-1\\) because that is the smallest integer that is greater than \\(-1.75\\).\n\nReflect:\n- I feel pretty sure about this. The ceiling function works opposite to the floor function, which rounds down. So, despite us often associating \"rounding up\" with higher numbers, here, \"up\" simply means closer to zero for negatives.\n\n- Let me quickly verify my understanding to ensure no errors: If this was a positive number like \\(1.75\\), the ceiling would take it to \\(2\\). For a negative number like \\(-1.75\\), it makes sense we should move towards zero from the left, landing on \\(-1\\).\n\nMistakes and Recalibrations:\n- I initially could have confused directionality, but the towards-zero approach for negatives with the ceiling function seems right.\n\nFinal Check:\n- A thought experiment: If this was \\(-2\\), the ceiling would be \\(-2\\). If it was \\(-2.5\\), it would also be \\(-2\\). For anything from \\(-2.01\\) to just before \\(-1\\), the ceiling should be \\(-1\\), as established.\n\nConclusion:\nSo, the correct evaluated value for \\(\\left\\lceil -\\frac{7}{4} \\right\\rceil\\) is \\(-1\\). I feel confident that this is the correct answer.",
