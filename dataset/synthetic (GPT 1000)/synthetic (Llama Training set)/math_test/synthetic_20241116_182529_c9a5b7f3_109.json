    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, it seems that we have a geometrical problem involving distances between three points: Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the airport. The key piece of information is that the airport is located at a specific distance southwest of St. Paul and southeast of Minneapolis. \n\nFirst, I've got to visualize this: We've essentially got a triangle here. A sketch would help, but let's imagine it mentally: \n\n1. **Identify what the problem is asking for:** We're trying to find the distance between downtown St. Paul and downtown Minneapolis. \n\n2. **Positioning the points:**\n   - Let's call the airport point A.\n   - Downtown St. Paul will be point B.\n   - Downtown Minneapolis is point C.\n\n3. **Understanding the layout:**\n   - A is 8 miles southwest of B (St. Paul).\n   - A is 10 miles southeast of C (Minneapolis).\n\nWait a minute \u2014 since we're talking geographical directions like southwest and southeast, I'm wondering if this implies using vectors or a Cartesian coordinate system. I should place the points on a plane and use these directions to determine the position:\n\n4. **Setting up coordinates:** \n   - Assume St. Paul (B) is at the origin (0,0). \n   - Since A is 8 miles southwest, a possible coordinate could be A at (-8, -8). This way, each leg (east-west and north-south) forms an equal right triangle component. But I'm actually over-simplifying the angle to 45 degrees because of the use of 'southwest'.\n\n5. **Defining Minneapolis position:** \n   - If A is 10 miles southeast of Minneapolis, I picture A moving northeast to Minneapolis. So actually, considering vector operations or similar constructs, assume C at a position that results in line AC being 10 miles. Again, geometry dictates C could be at something like (10, -10) for simplicity, assuming symmetry or ideal case angles for illustration.\n\nHmm, I need a better handle on this. \n\n6. **Apply the Distance Formula effectively:**\n   - Let's denote A by (x, y). We suspect A is within an overlapping region between the two given direction distances. Perhaps easier said than done without precise angles, but southwest implies movement towards (1,1) from B, and southeast implies towards (1,-1) from C. \n   - Use correct positions under these conditions, recognizing adjustments to correct for realistic placement. Using estimated directions was just a launching pad. \n\n7. **Correct Adjustment and Check:** \n   - Find specific angles/coordinates using trigonometry. Let\u2019s adjust based on specific intersections. Consider using law of cosines or Cartesian adjustment for better precision.\n   - While the guess of (0,0), (-8,-8), and (10, -10) simplifies it, correcting for precise geography and angles as expected (mapping onto a grid or mapping with equation corrections to approximate direction distance vectors) is fitting.\n\n8. **Simplifying and checking approach decisions:**\n   - Originally, too simple maybe, remedy with:\n   - Exact vector breakdowns, plotted accordingly or checked through map projection or latitude/longitude equivalent adjustments. Essentially refine to closely hit solution.\n   \nFinally, back up and try confirmed calcs:\n   - Let's assume my earlier spotting was fine, so simple distance restores simple triangle geometry with trig corrections, confirm realistic contextually. Truly these assumptions sufficing approximate differences over distance, but not relying too much on roughness.\n\n9. **Applying more reliable formula:**\n   - Using Pythagoreans: \n     \\[ \\text{Distance}_{B \\to C}^2 = \\text{Distance}_{B \\to A}^2 + \\text{Distance}_{A \\to C}^2 \\]\n   - Solve:\n     \\[\\text{Distance}_{B \\to C} = \\sqrt{8^2 + 10^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 100} = \\sqrt{164} \\]\n\n10. **Calibrate and round:**\n    - Calculate: Approximately \\(\\sqrt{164} \\approx 12.8\\); rounding appropriately yields \\(13\\) miles.\n\nI solidified a triangulated positioning mindset and simulated potential alignments to verify coherence, while returning mindful of alternative optimization or confirming accepted problem practicalities detail-wise. It\u2019s sometimes the orientation specifics require thoughtful command to analyze correctly. After checking operations, sticking with 13 miles as the determined output maintains this traditional predictive reasoned approach.",

  "ground_truth": "Let downtown St. Paul, downtown Minneapolis, and the airport be located at $S$, $M$, and $A$, respectively. Then $\\triangle MAS$ has a right angle at $A$, so by the Pythagorean Theorem, \\[\nMS= \\sqrt{10^{2}+8^{2}}= \\sqrt{164}\\approx 12.8.\n\\] Therefore, the distance between the two downtowns to the nearest mile is  $\\boxed{\\text{13}}$ miles."
