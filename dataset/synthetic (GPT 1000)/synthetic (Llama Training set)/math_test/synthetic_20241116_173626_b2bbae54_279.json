    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\nWhen I see this problem about ordering hats, my first thought is about permutations because I remember permutations are used to determine the number of ways to arrange things when order matters. This reminds me of something I've done before where there were a set number of unique items, and I had to arrange them. So, my initial instinct is to apply the concept of permutations here.\n\nBrainstorming Different Strategies:\n- Permutation formula: I know that if I have \\( n \\) unique items, the number of ways to arrange them is given by \\( n! \\) (n factorial).\n- Listing possibilities: Another method could be listing all possibilities, but with 7 hats, that seems impractical.\n- Using combinatorics: I could explore combinations if order didn't matter, but since it does, permutations are more suitable.\n\nI'll start with the permutation approach as it feels most straightforward.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n1. **Understanding the Task**:\n   - I need to find the number of ways to arrange 7 different colored hats. Each arrangement will be different since the hats are distinct in color.\n   - This reminds me that I\u2019m dealing with a problem where order is significant, confirming the use of permutations.\n\n2. **Applying Permutation Thought**:\n   - If I have 7 items, there are 7 choices for the first position, 6 choices for the second (since one hat is already used), 5 for the third, continuing this pattern until only 1 hat remains.\n   - This is essentially calculating \\( 7! \\).\n\n3. **Calculating \\(7!\\) (7 factorial)**:\n   - \\(7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\).\n\n4. **Performing the Calculation**:\n   - \\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\)\n   - \\(42 \\times 5 = 210\\)\n   - \\(210 \\times 4 = 840\\)\n   - \\(840 \\times 3 = 2520\\)\n   - \\(2520 \\times 2 = 5040\\)\n   - Multiplying by 1 doesn\u2019t change 5040.\n\n5. **Quick Reflection**:\n   - \\(5040\\) seems reasonable; it\u2019s a number you'd expect from 7 factorial based on previous experience with factorial problems.\n\nChecking the Answer:\n- **Quick Verification**: The calculation steps make sense; each step logically follows the factorial pattern. The numeric multiplication also seems accurate.\n- **Reflect a Moment**: I consider if there was any simpler way or if any assumptions were wrong, but everything checks out. Using \\( n! \\) for permutations when no restrictions are set is standard practice, so this feels correct.\n\nFinal Thought:\n- Oh! I realized I almost overthought considering combinations or listing out possibilities, but the direct application of the factorial made it smooth.\n- It's satisfying when everything aligns logically, and all parts of my approach reinforce each other.\n\n**Final Answer: There are 5040 ways to order 7 different colored hats in a row.**",
