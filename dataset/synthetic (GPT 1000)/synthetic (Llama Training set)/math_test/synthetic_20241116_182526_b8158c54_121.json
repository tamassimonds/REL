    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. How many positive integers are less than \\(100\\pi\\)? Initially, this seems like a straightforward problem but let's see what challenges might arise as we work through it.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n- **First Thoughts:**\n  - The problem asks for the count of positive integers less than \\(100\\pi\\).\n  - My initial thought is that this feels like it must relate somehow to understanding \\(\\pi\\) in the context of a straightforward numerical calculation.\n  - We're dealing with \\(\\pi\\), an irrational number approximately equal to 3.14159. Multiplying by 100 will push it into a range I'm somewhat more familiar with, but let's keep exploring.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating \\(100\\pi\\)\n\n- **First Approach:**\n  - Calculate \\(100 \\times \\pi\\).\n  - Using the approximation \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14159\\), compute \\(100\\pi \\approx 100 \\times 3.14159 = 314.159\\).\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - Make sure this number seems sensible. Yes, \\(314.159\\) is reasonable since it\u2019s just over 300, which makes sense given 100 times 3.\n  \n### Step 3: Exploring the Problem Range\n\n- **What Numbers Are Less Than 314.159?**\n  - Positive integers less than 314.159 would start at 1 and go up to the greatest integer less than or equal to 314.159.\n  - The largest integer less than 314.159 is 314.\n\n- **Reflections:**\n  - Double-checking: It\u2019s important to verify whether rounding affects anything.\n  - By definition, any integer strictly less than 314.159 won\u2019t include 314.159 itself; hence going up to 314 seems correct.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Integers\n\n- **Counting the Integers:**\n  - Since we're likely counting how many integers exist from 1 up to 314 (exclusive of 315), that would be directly counting from 1 to 314 inclusive.\n  - Count: \\(314 - 1 + 1 = 314\\).\n\n### Step 5: Verification\n\n- **Is Everything Right?**\n  - Seems straightforward, but always double-check assumptions.\n  - Recalculating \\(100 \\times 3.14159\\) gives 314.159 which confirms our upper bound.\n  - Number sequence is solid: all positive integers up to 314 are counted.\n\n- **Final Thoughts:**\n  - I don\u2019t notice any errors in approach. Everything checks out with initial estimation expectations.\n  - Thus, there are 314 positive integers less than \\(100\\pi\\).\n\nAfter reflection and verifying calculations, I am confident that the answer is that there are **314 positive integers less than \\(100\\pi\\)**.",

  "ground_truth": "Based on our knowledge of the decimal expansion of $\\pi$, we can quickly estimate that $100 \\pi \\approx 314.15$. So the largest positive integer less than $100\\pi$ is 314. Therefore, the positive integers are 1, 2, 3, $\\ldots$, 313, 314, for a total of $\\boxed{314}$ positive integers."
