    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it step-by-step, embracing any confusion or realizations along the way.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: The problem is asking us to find the number of ways to place two indistinguishable pieces on a chessboard such that they are either in the same row or in the same column. \n\n- There's an 8x8 chessboard.\n- The pieces are indistinguishable, which means swapping them doesn't count as a new arrangement.\n- The condition is that the pieces have to be in either the same row or the same column.\n\nIt sort of feels like a combinations or permutations problem, but with a unique twist because of the indistinguishability and the row/column condition.\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorm Possible Strategies\n\nLet's think:\n1. Should I consider all possible pairs on the board first and then filter by row/column condition? \n2. Or should I directly try to count row and column possibilities?\n3. Does it help to break the problem down into two separate cases: same row and same column?\n\nThis reminds me of similar counting problems, like seating arrangements on a line (but with conditions), so let's try to break it down.\n\n### Step 3: Count Arrangements for Rows\n\nOkay, let's try counting based on rows first:\n\n- In each row, there are 8 squares.\n- Choosing any two squares in a row is a combination problem. For any particular row, there are `C(8, 2)` ways to choose 2 squares from 8, which is 28 ways. \n\nQuick check: Yup, \\( \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28 \\). Reasonable so far.\n\n- Since there are 8 rows, multiply by 8: \\( 8 \\times 28 = 224 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Count Arrangements for Columns\n\nNow count based on columns:\n\n- Similarly, each column has 8 squares, and we choose 2 squares from a column.\n- This is again \\( \\binom{8}{2} = 28 \\) ways for each column.\n\nQuick check: Yes, same computation applies, it's consistent.\n\n- And there are 8 columns: \\( 8 \\times 28 = 224 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Combine Row and Column Cases\n\nUp to here, we have counted separately for rows and columns. Let's combine them:\n\n- Total from rows and columns: \\( 224 + 224 = 448 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Check for Overcounting\n\nWait a second, let's think if we're overcounting any arrangements.\n\n- Overcounting happens if pieces can be placed such that they're in both the same row and the same column. But that's impossible for distinct squares because they\u2019d occupy a single square, which isn\u2019t allowed for two pieces.\n- Therefore, there's no overlap, no overcounting. \n\n### Step 7: Final Reflection and Solution\n\nFinal thoughts: I feel confident about the approach and the calculations seem consistent. Combining results without overlap consideration ensures logical integrity. Everything checks out with my quick reviews along the way.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to place two indistinguishable pieces on the chessboard, fulfilling the row/column conditions, is \\( \\boxed{448} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "The first piece can go in any of the $64$ squares. The second piece can then be in any of $14$ positions, since there are $7$ unoccupied squares in the row of the first piece, as well as $7$ unoccupied squares in the column of the first piece. This would seem to give us $64\\cdot 14$ choices for the placement of the two pieces. However, order doesn't matter (we said the pieces are indistinguishable), so the actual number of choices is $(64\\cdot 14)/2$, which is $\\boxed{448}$."
