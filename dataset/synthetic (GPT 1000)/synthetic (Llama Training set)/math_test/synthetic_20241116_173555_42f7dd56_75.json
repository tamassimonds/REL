My goal is to simplify the expression \\(4(3r^3+5r-6)-6(2r^3-r^2+4r)\\) and try to express it in the form \\(Ar^2 + Br + C\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Here I'm dealing with an algebraic expression that involves multiplying out some terms and simplifying.\n- It looks like something I've done before\u2014maybe I can distribute the multipliers to each term inside the brackets first. That usually helps to breakdown the expression.\n- Hmm, I notice there are cubic, quadratic, and linear terms. So after expansion, I'm looking to combine like terms.\n\n**Step 1: Expand the Expression**\n\nLet's start by distributing:\n\nFor the first term, \\(4(3r^3+5r-6)\\):\n\n- Distribute \\(4\\) to each term inside: \n  - \\(4 \\times 3r^3 = 12r^3\\)\n  - \\(4 \\times 5r = 20r\\)\n  - \\(4 \\times (-6) = -24\\)\n\nThis simplifies the first part to: \\(12r^3 + 20r - 24\\)\n\nFor the second term, \\(-6(2r^3-r^2+4r)\\):\n\n- Distribute \\(-6\\) to each term inside:\n  - \\(-6 \\times 2r^3 = -12r^3\\)\n  - \\(-6 \\times (-r^2) = 6r^2\\)\n  - \\(-6 \\times 4r = -24r\\)\n\nThis simplifies the second part to: \\(-12r^3 + 6r^2 - 24r\\)\n\n**Step 2: Combine the Expressions**\n\nThe expanded expression is:\n\n\\[ (12r^3 + 20r - 24) + (-12r^3 + 6r^2 - 24r) \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n- For \\(r^3\\), we have: \\(12r^3 - 12r^3 = 0\\) (Ah, the \\(r^3\\) terms cancel out. Simplifying already!)\n- For \\(r^2\\), we have: \\(0 + 6r^2 = 6r^2\\)\n- For \\(r\\), we have: \\(20r - 24r = -4r\\)\n- Constant term: \\(-24 + 0 = -24\\)\n\n**Step 3: Final Answer Check**\n\nAfter combining, the simplified expression is:\n\\[ 6r^2 - 4r - 24 \\]\n\nNow, let's see if it fits the form \\(Ar^2 + Br + C\\):\n- \\(A = 6\\)\n- \\(B = -4\\)\n- \\(C = -24\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The process seems to have gone smoothly. Distributing and combining terms felt like the right approach, and I ended up with a result that matches the desired form.\n- Double-checking my distribution and arithmetic, everything seems to line up.\n- Initially, I thought I\u2019d encounter a cubic term in the final answer, but it was satisfying to see them cancel out.\n\nThere we go, that looks correct. I've reviewed and I'm confident in this simplified result.",
