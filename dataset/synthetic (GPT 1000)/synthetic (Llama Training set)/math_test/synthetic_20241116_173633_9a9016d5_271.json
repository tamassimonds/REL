    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and take it step by step. \n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe question asks for the coefficient of \\(xy\\) in the expansion of \\((3x + (2y + 1))^2\\). This is essentially a binomial expansion problem, but the expression inside has a nested term \\((2y + 1)\\). My immediate thought is that this is similar to a binomial expansion, but with a twist due to the nested part. I need to expand this and look for the \\(xy\\) term in the resulting polynomial.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Expression**\n\nFirst, I should simplify the given expression to make the expansion easier. I see \\((3x + (2y + 1))\\), which can be rewritten simply as \\((3x + 2y + 1)\\). This looks like a simpler binomial form, and now I recognize it as a square of a trinomial.\n\n**Reflect**: This feels right because simplifying makes it clearer what I'm actually going to expand.\n\n**Step 2: Expand the Expression**\n\nNow, let's expand \\((3x + 2y + 1)^2\\). Expanding a binomial squared, \\((a + b + c)^2\\), involves the distributive property:\n\\[\n(a + b + c)^2 = (a + b + c)(a + b + c)\n\\]\n\nSo, for \\((3x + 2y + 1)^2\\):\n\n\\[\n= (3x + 2y + 1)(3x + 2y + 1)\n\\]\n\nTo expand this, I should multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket to get:\n\n1. \\((3x)(3x) = 9x^2\\)\n2. \\((3x)(2y) = 6xy\\)\n3. \\((3x)(1) = 3x\\)\n4. \\((2y)(3x) = 6xy\\)\n5. \\((2y)(2y) = 4y^2\\)\n6. \\((2y)(1) = 2y\\)\n7. \\((1)(3x) = 3x\\)\n8. \\((1)(2y) = 2y\\)\n9. \\((1)(1) = 1\\)\n\n**Step 3: Combine Like Terms**\n\nThe next task is to combine all the like terms from the expansion:\n- \\(9x^2\\) stands alone.\n- The \\(xy\\) terms: \\(6xy + 6xy = 12xy\\).\n- The \\(x\\) terms: \\(3x + 3x = 6x\\).\n- The \\(y\\) terms: \\(2y + 2y = 4y\\).\n- The \\(y^2\\) term stands alone as \\(4y^2\\).\n- The constant term is \\(1\\).\n\nThus, the expanded form is:\n\n\\[ \n9x^2 + 12xy + 6x + 4y^2 + 4y + 1 \n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Coefficient of \\(xy\\)**\n\nNow, focusing on the specific task, I need the coefficient of \\(xy\\), which I've found to be \\(12\\) from the combined middle terms in the expansion.\n\n**Reflect**: The numbers seem reasonable, and I've accounted for each combination of terms, including cross multiplying for the \\(xy\\) terms. Let's recap to ensure no steps were missed.\n\n**Check All Steps:**\n\n- Expansion was performed methodically.\n- All terms were correctly identified.\n- Like terms were combined accurately into the final expanded polynomial.\n- Specifically identified the desired coefficient successfully.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe coefficient of \\(xy\\) in the expansion of \\((3x + (2y + 1))^2\\) is \\(12\\). Reflecting again, this approach systematically addressed the problem and yielded a consistent result. \n\nThe problem initially seemed complex due to nested terms, but separating and expanding methodically reduced complexity and ensured clarity in finding the correct result.",

  "ground_truth": "Using the Binomial Theorem, we can expand this to get $(3x)^2+2(3x)(2y+1)+(2y+1)^2$. The only $xy$ comes from the middle term $2(3x)(2y+1)=12xy+6x$, hence the coefficient is $\\boxed{12}$."
