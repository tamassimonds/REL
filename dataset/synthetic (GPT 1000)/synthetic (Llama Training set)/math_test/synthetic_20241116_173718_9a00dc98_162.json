    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by exploring different angles and ideas. The problem asks us to evaluate \\(g(f(x))\\) when \\(x = -3\\), given the functions \\(f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x}\\) and \\(g(x) = x^3 + 2\\). \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Understand the Composite Function**: We need \\(g(f(x))\\) which means we substitute the function \\(f(x)\\) into \\(g(x)\\). So, first I need the expression for \\(f(x)\\), and then I plug that into \\(g(x)\\). Finally, evaluate at \\(x = -3\\).\n\n2. **Function Evaluation**: The function \\(f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x}\\) can be simplified initially before substitution. When I substitute, I simply follow through the operations in \\(g(x) = x^3 + 2\\).\n\n3. **Let\u2019s Start**: Okay, attacking step by step. Calculate the required value for \\(f(x)\\) at the given \\(x\\) and then evaluate it through the function \\(g(x)\\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Calculate \\(f(-3)\\)**:\n   - \\(f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 2x + 3}{x}\\)\n   - Substitute \\(x = -3\\): \\(f(-3) = \\frac{(-3)^2 + 2(-3) + 3}{-3}\\)\n   - Calculate terms inside the numerator:\n     - \\((-3)^2 = 9\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times (-3) = -6\\)\n     - Numerator becomes: \\(9 - 6 + 3 = 6\\)\n   - \\(f(-3) = \\frac{6}{-3} = -2\\)\n\n2. **Substitute \\(f(-3)\\) in \\(g(x)\\)**:\n   - Now \\(f(-3) = -2\\), so we substitute this into \\(g(x)\\):\n   - \\(g(f(-3)) = g(-2)\\)\n   - Given \\(g(x) = x^3 + 2\\)\n   - We need to calculate \\(g(-2)\\):\n     - \\((-2)^3 = -8\\)\n     - So, \\(g(-2) = -8 + 2 = -6\\)\n\n3. **Reflect and Review**:\n   - Just pause and check if these calculations make sense.\n   - Evaluating \\(f(-3)\\) was straightforward after computing the terms correctly.\n   - In \\(g(-2)\\), the cubic and constant were handled correctly, so results should be consistent.\n\n4. **Final Conclusion**:\n   - After checking over calculations and logic, my final answer is:\n   - \\(g(f(-3)) = -6\\)\n\n**Thinking and Checking the Process**:\n- The sequence of operations appears logical.\n- Evaluations for given values were handled step-by-step.\n- The approach checks out with initial hypotheses and expectations. No wrong turns detected upon reviewing steps.\n\n**Feeling Confident**:\n- All basic arithmetic aligned with expectations.\n- The function operation conceptualizations were appropriately warranted.\n\nSo, I confidently conclude that for \\(x = -3\\), \\(g(f(x)) = -6\\). Always wise to take another glance at arithmetic when time allows, but upon final review, the provided solution holds firm.",

  "ground_truth": "We can first evaluate $f(-3)$. $$f(-3) = \\frac{(-3)^2 + 2(-3) + 3}{-3} = \\frac{9 - 6 + 3}{-3} = -2$$ Now we substitute $f(-3) = -2$ into $g(f(x))$. $$g(-2) = (-2)^3 + 2 = -8 + 2 = \\boxed{-6}$$"
