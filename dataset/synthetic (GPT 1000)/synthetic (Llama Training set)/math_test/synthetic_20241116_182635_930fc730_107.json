    "working_out": "Alright, let's start by understanding the question and breaking it down step-by-step. We have Mr. Cole who needs to select a certain number of girls and boys to participate in a trip, and there are more candidates available than spots. This suggests we'll need to use combinations, a method in combinatorics where the order doesn't matter.\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Understanding\n- **First Thought:** This looks like a combinations problem because we are selecting 3 girls from a pool of 6, and 5 boys from a pool of 11. The order doesn't matter, just the selection itself.\n- **What do I know?** I know that the combinations formula is \\(\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items to choose from, and \\(r\\) is the number of items to choose.\n- **Initial Calculation Plan:** Calculate the combinations separately for girls and boys, then multiply the results to find the total number of ways to select both girls and boys together.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n1. **Calculate the Number of Ways to Choose Girls:**\n   - Total girls = 6\n   - Number of girls to choose = 3\n   - Combinations for girls is given by \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n   - Calculation: \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20\\).\n   - **Check:** Quick mental check, does 20 sound reasonable? Yes, because we\u2019re choosing a fairly small number (3) from another small group (6).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Ways to Choose Boys:**\n   - Total boys = 11\n   - Number of boys to choose = 5\n   - Combinations for boys is given by \\(\\binom{11}{5}\\).\n   - Calculation: \\(\\binom{11}{5} = \\frac{11!}{5!(11-5)!} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 462\\).\n   - **Check:** The calculation is a bit more complex, but a quick check using a calculator or rethinking it reminds me that choosing 5 from 11 indeed allows for many combinations, so 462 seems plausible.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Combinations:**\n   - Total combinations = Combinations for girls \\(\\times\\) Combinations for boys\n   - Total ways = \\(20 \\times 462 = 9240\\).\n   - **Check:** Reflecting on this large number: It makes sense because both groups had numerous ways to be selected.\n\n### Reflection and Conclusion\n- **Is the final answer reasonable?** Yes, after multiplying two reasonably calculated values (20 ways to choose girls and 462 ways to choose boys), the large number of overall combinations at 9240 aligns well with expectation.\n- **Repeat check:** I quickly revalidate my method and calculations since operations like multiplication can easily have mistakes. Everything looks correct.\n\nSo, the total number of ways Mr. Cole can select 3 girls and 5 boys from a group of 6 girls and 11 boys is **9240 ways**.",

  "ground_truth": "In this problem, Mr. Cole is really selecting two separate groups.  He can choose 3 girls from the 6 girls total in $$ \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20 $$ways, and 5 boys from the 11 boys total in $$ \\binom{11}{5} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 462 $$ways.  Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the 20 ways to pick the girls, there are 462 ways to pick the boys), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 8-member trip: $$ \\binom{6}{3}\\binom{11}{5} = (20)(462) = \\boxed{9,\\!240}. $$"
