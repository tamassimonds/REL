    "working_out": "Great! Let's dive into this problem step-by-step. It's crucial to brainstorm and think aloud to really understand what's being asked and how we can solve it.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\n- Okay, the problem is about a cube with six faces, each labeled with a different digit from 1 to 6, being tossed. I need to find the probability of the top face showing either a 5 or a 6. \n- This feels similar to problems I've done before related to probability and dice, where each face has an equal chance of appearing. \n- Since we\u2019re dealing with probability, I need to consider the number of favorable outcomes compared to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: A standard cube (or die) has six faces, so each face has an equal chance to be on top after a toss. Therefore, there are 6 possible outcomes.\n\n2. **Favorable Outcomes**: The favorable outcomes are those where the top face shows either a 5 or a 6. There are two such outcomes: one for 5 and one for 6.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Probability\n\nThe probability of an event is gotten by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n- Number of favorable outcomes = 2 (since we want either a 5 or a 6).\n- Total possible outcomes = 6 (one for each face of the cube).\n\nSo, the probability \\( P \\) is given by: \n\\[ P(\\text{5 or 6}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{2}{6} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Fraction\n\nWow, okay, I notice that \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\) can be simplified. Let's do that to get the final probability:\n\n- \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n### Step 4: Reflect and Verify\n\n- Does this make sense? Yes, since the die is fair, each face has an equal 1/6 probability of being on top, and adding up probabilities of two faces gives us \\(\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n- Is this consistent with the rules of probability? Absolutely, it fits the definition where probabilities add up to 1 when considering all outcomes.\n- Quick check: If I think about the reverse, the probability of not getting a 5 or 6 (i.e., getting 1, 2, 3, or 4) would be \\(\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\\). Together, \\(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = 1\\), which checks out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probability that the number on the top face is 5 or 6 is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nThis makes sense given our understanding of probabilities in a fair die scenario. All checks line up, and I'm confident this is correct.",

  "ground_truth": "When the cube is tossed, the total number of possibilities is $6$ and the number of desired outcomes is $2.$ So the probability of tossing a $5$ or $6$ is $\\frac{2}{6}$ or $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}.$"
