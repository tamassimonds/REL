    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- When I first read this problem, I'm thinking about probabilities and the fact that they should always add up to 1. This is a basic principle I remember from my studies.\n- The problem is asking for the probability that the dart will not land on the target. Since I know the probability of hitting the target is given, I already have an idea that I might simply need to find the complement to solve this problem.\n\nBrainstorming Strategies:\n- The most direct approach that comes to mind is using the complement rule in probability. If I know the probability of one event, the complement will give me the probability of the opposite event.\n- Another approach could include setting up a simple equation where the sum of the probability of hitting the target and the probability of not hitting the target equals 1.\n- I don\u2019t think we need complicated calculations or the use of Venn diagrams, since this is a straightforward probability question with only two possible outcomes.\n\nApproach and Calculation:\n1. Let's start with the complement rule. The probability of event A (dart hitting the target) is $\\frac{3}{8}$.\n2. The probability of the complement of event A (dart not hitting the target) would be $1 - P(A)$.\n3. Calculating this, we take $1 - \\frac{3}{8}$.\n4. Let me do this subtraction: $1$ can be written as $\\frac{8}{8}$, so we have $\\frac{8}{8} - \\frac{3}{8}$.\n5. Now, subtract the fractions: $\\frac{8}{8} - \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{5}{8}$.\n\nReflecting on the Answer:\n- I feel confident about this calculation. The logic seems consistent with the complement rule.\n- Just as a quick check, I'll add the probability of hitting the target ($\\frac{3}{8}$) and the probability of not hitting the target ($\\frac{5}{8}$). It should equal 1, confirming my result.\n- So: $\\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{8}{8} = 1$. This check holds, reinforcing that my approach and calculation are correct.\n\nConclusion:\n- Given the problem and the calculations we've gone through, the probability that the dart will not land on the target is indeed $\\frac{5}{8}$.\n- I\u2019m satisfied with this solution, as the method used was straightforward and verified by basic probability principles.",
