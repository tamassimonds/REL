    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step-by-step. The problem asks us to find the number of sides of a regular polygon given that its interior angle is 6.5 times its exterior angle. \n\n### First Thoughts:\n\n- This problem is similar to other polygon-related problems I've seen before. \n- I recall that the sum of an interior and exterior angle in a polygon is always 180\u00b0 because they are supplementary.\n- The formula for the measure of an exterior angle of a regular polygon is calculated by dividing 360\u00b0 by the number of sides, \\( n \\).\n\n### Strategy:\n\n- Understand and utilize the relationship between interior and exterior angles given in the problem.\n- Use the formulas for the measures of interior and exterior angles to set up an equation.\n- Solve for \\( n \\), the number of sides of the polygon.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Relationship\n\n- Let's denote the measure of the exterior angle by \\( E \\).\n- The interior angle \\( I \\) is then given as \\( I = 6.5E \\).\n\n### Step 2: Use the Supplementary Property\n\n- Since interior and exterior angles are supplementary, we have the equation:\n  \\[\n  I + E = 180\u00b0\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Substitute the Given Relationship\n\n- Substituting \\( I = 6.5E \\), we have:\n  \\[\n  6.5E + E = 180\u00b0\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  7.5E = 180\u00b0\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the Exterior Angle\n\n- Solving for \\( E \\), we divide both sides by 7.5:\n  \\[\n  E = \\frac{180\u00b0}{7.5} = 24\u00b0\n  \\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Number of Sides\n\n- Since the exterior angle \\( E \\) is 24\u00b0, and knowing that the sum of all exterior angles in any polygon is 360\u00b0, we can calculate the number of sides \\( n \\) as:\n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{360\u00b0}{E} = \\frac{360\u00b0}{24\u00b0} = 15\n  \\]\n\n### Check the Work:\n\n- To ensure the answer makes sense, let's verify:\n  - Calculate the interior angle: \\( I = 6.5 \\times 24\u00b0 = 156\u00b0 \\).\n  - Check the supplementary property: \\( 156\u00b0 + 24\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 \\) (This checks out).\n\n- Quick reflection: \n  - The calculation and logic look solid, as all steps corroborate the initial condition.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe regular polygon has 15 sides. The problem aligns with common polygon properties and principles. Reflecting on the solution, everything seems to be in order and consistent with the problem statement. This makes sense given our reasoning and calculations.",

  "ground_truth": "The measure of an interior angle of a regular $n$-gon is $\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$ degrees and the measure of an exterior angle is $\\frac{360}{n}$ degrees.  Solving  \\[\n\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}=6.5\\cdot\\left(\\frac{360}{n}\\right),\n\\] we find $n=\\boxed{15}$."
