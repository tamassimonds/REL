    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. \n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nThe problem states that we need to find how many values of \\( x \\), which is a multiple of 6, have the property that \\( x^2 < 200 \\). This range includes potentially negative values since we aren't restricted to positive multiples of 6.\n\n### Brainstorming\n\nWhen I first look at this, I realize we need to check multiples of 6 and then square them to see if they're less than 200. It seems straightforward, but I need to be methodical to ensure I consider negative multiples as well. \n\nPossible approaches might include:\n- Listing multiples of 6 and squaring them.\n- Using inequalities to restrict the range of \\( x \\).\n\n### First Approach: Listing Multiples\n\nTo start, I think about the multiples of 6. They are \\( \\ldots, -12, -6, 0, 6, 12, \\ldots \\). I'll check the square of these to see which satisfy \\( x^2 < 200 \\).\n\n### Calculations\n\n1. **Positive multiples of 6:**\n   - \\( x = 0 \\): \\( 0^2 = 0 \\) which is less than 200.\n   - \\( x = 6 \\): \\( 6^2 = 36 \\) which is less than 200.\n   - \\( x = 12 \\): \\( 12^2 = 144 \\) which is less than 200.\n   - \\( x = 18 \\): \\( 18^2 = 324 \\) which is *not* less than 200.\n\n   I need to stop at \\( x = 12 \\) because \\( x = 18 \\) exceeds the limit.\n\n2. **Negative multiples of 6:**\n   - \\( x = -6 \\): \\((-6)^2 = 36\\) which is less than 200.\n   - \\( x = -12 \\): \\((-12)^2 = 144\\) which is less than 200.\n   - \\( x = -18 \\): \\((-18)^2 = 324\\) which is *not* less than 200.\n\n   Again, I stop at \\( x = -12 \\).\n\n### Reviewing Results\n\nAlright, based on my calculations, I have the allowable values for \\( x \\) as \\( -12, -6, 0, 6, 12 \\). I listed each multiple, squared it, and confirmed it was less than 200 where applicable. Now let's count these values: \nThere are 5 values in total.\n\n### Reflect and Check\n\nQuickly, let's think about whether this method makes sense. We considered the property \\( x^2 < 200 \\) and accommodated both positive and negative values of \\( x \\). It was important that we square each candidate since squaring erases negativity.\n\nMy thought process feels robust here. I considered all necessary multiples of 6 and checked them until they failed to meet the condition. This logical approach appears solid.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, there are 5 possible values of \\( x \\) that satisfy \\( x^2 < 200 \\) while being multiples of 6.",

  "ground_truth": "The multiples $-12, -6, 0, 6,$ and 12 all have squares less than 200, for a total of $\\boxed{5}$ possible values. Since $18^2$ is bigger than 200, the squares of all the other multiples of $x$ are greater than 200. (Recall that the square of a negative number is positive)."
