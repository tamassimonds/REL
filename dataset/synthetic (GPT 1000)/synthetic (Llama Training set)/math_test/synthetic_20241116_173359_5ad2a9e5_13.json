    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step-by-step by really thinking through it like you would if you were solving it on paper. I\u2019ll narrate my thought process along the way.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what we're being asked. We have two numbers. Let's call them \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). We know two things about these numbers:\n\n1. Their sum is 25, so \\( x + y = 25 \\).\n2. Their difference is 11, so \\( x - y = 11 \\).\n\nWe need to find out which one is the smaller number. \n\n### First Thoughts\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, it reminds me of solving systems of equations. I\u2019ve dealt with similar linear equations before. The typical approach would be to use substitution or elimination to solve for each variable.\n\n### Brainstorming Approaches\n\n1. **Substitution Method**: Solve one of the equations for one variable and substitute it into the other.\n   \n2. **Elimination Method**: Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one of the variables.\n\nI think trying either of these methods should help us find both numbers.\n\n### Applying the Elimination Method\n\nHmm, since both equations are already nicely set up:\n- \\( x + y = 25 \\)\n- \\( x - y = 11 \\)\n\nI see an immediate opportunity to eliminate \\( y \\) by adding the two equations. Let's try that:\n\n\\[\n(x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2x = 36\n\\]\n\nOkay, let's solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{36}{2} = 18\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( x = 18 \\). Now, remember \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are the two numbers where \\( x \\) is derived, possibly being the larger one due to the equation \\( x - y = 11 \\).\n\n### Finding \\( y \\)\n\nNow that we know one variable, \\( x = 18 \\), let\u2019s find \\( y \\). We can substitute \\( x \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\nx + y = 25\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 18 \\):\n\n\\[\n18 + y = 25\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\ny = 25 - 18 = 7\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( y = 7 \\).\n\n### Reflecting on the Solution\n\nBefore finalizing, let me quickly double-check that these values satisfy both original equations:\n- For \\( x + y = 25 \\), substituting gives \\( 18 + 7 = 25 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- For \\( x - y = 11 \\), substituting gives \\( 18 - 7 = 11 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out, so both numbers correctly satisfy the problem's conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe smaller of the two numbers is \\( y = 7 \\).\n\nReflecting on the approach, using the elimination method was efficient because of the way the original equations were structured. It allowed me to find \\( x \\) directly without rearranging terms, which saved time. In problems like these, it's crucial to choose the approach best suited to the format of the given information.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x,y$ be the two numbers, $x>y$. Then $x+y=25$ and $x-y=11$, thus:\n\n$y=\\frac{1}{2}\\left((x+y)-(x-y)\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}(25-11)=\\boxed{7}$."
