    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about finding the value of \\((p-1)(q-1)\\) given that two numbers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) satisfy \\(\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n- We have two variables, \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), both greater than 1.\n- The condition given is \\(\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1\\).\n- We need to find the value of \\((p-1)(q-1)\\).\n\nHmm... this kind of reminds me of certain algebraic manipulations with reciprocals and sums equalling one. I should try to understand how \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are related based on this condition.\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorm Possible Approaches\n- **Algebraic Manipulation**: Start by rewriting the given equation and manipulating it to express \\(q\\) in terms of \\(p\\) or vice versa.\n- **Direct Calculation**: Plug in specific values to get a sense of how they behave.\n- Hmm... let's start with algebraic manipulation. It might give a clearer relationship between \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\n### Step 3: Algebraic Manipulation\nFrom the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1\n\\]\n\nCombine the terms over a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{q + p}{pq} = 1\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(pq\\):\n\n\\[\nq + p = pq\n\\]\n\nLet's reorganize this equation to see if we can express \\(q\\) in terms of \\(p\\), or simplify further:\n\n\\[\npq - p - q = 0\n\\]\n\nReflecting on that equation reminds me that this is a form of factorization. It's somewhat quadratic-like. Let's try completing the square or rearranging to hint at a factorization:\n\n\\[\npq - p - q + 1 = 1\n\\]\n\nFactor the left side:\n\n\\[\n(p-1)(q-1) = 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Reflect and Check\n- Hmm, that factorization step seemed a bit spontaneous. Let's verify.\n- Let's look again at the factorization: notice that if we expand \\((p-1)(q-1)\\), it equals \\(pq - p - q + 1\\).\n- And remember, we had: \\(pq - p - q = 0\\).\n- Therefore, \\(pq - p - q + 1 = 1\\).\n- That approach checks out\u2014\\((p-1)(q-1) = 1\\) is consistent with our steps.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe value of \\((p-1)(q-1)\\) is \\(1\\). This solution feels right since the steps logically followed from the original condition \\(\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1\\) and leveraged algebraic manipulation effectively.\n\nThat worked out neatly! If something feels wrong later, I can always revisit, maybe plug in some specific numbers to double-check, but this conclusion seems robust.",

  "ground_truth": "Multiplying both sides of the given equation by $p$, we see that $1+\\frac{p}{q} = p \\Rightarrow \\frac{p}{q} = p-1 \\Rightarrow p = q(p-1)$. But then $(p-1)(q-1) = q(p-1) - (p-1) = p -p +1 = \\boxed{1}$."
