    "working_out": "Alright, let's get into this problem and think it through step by step.\n\n### Initial Reaction\nOkay, we're looking for the remainder when the sum \\(1 + 12 + 123 + 1234 + 12345 + 123456 + 1234567 + 12345678\\) is divided by \\(5\\). This feels like one of those problems where I might be revisiting the concept of modulo arithmetic frequently. I remember that it usually helps to break it down into smaller parts, maybe figuring out the remainders of each individual number when divided by \\(5\\) first might be useful. \n\n### Step 1: Exploring a Strategy\nFirst, let's consider the pattern of the numbers: \n- Notice how each number just appends an additional digit '1, 2, 3...' at the end. This makes it a cumulative type of sequence.\n- Might be useful to individually calculate the remainder of each of these numbers when divided by \\(5\\) because this might simplify the process.\n\nI wonder: **Will each number have a predictable remainder when divided by \\(5\\)?**\n\n### Step 2: Calculating Each Remainder\nLet's actually compute the remainder for each number:\n\n1. \\(1 \\div 5\\) has a remainder of \\(1\\).\n2. \\(12 \\div 5\\) gives a remainder \\(2\\) (since \\(12 = 5 \\times 2 + 2\\)).\n3. \\(123 \\div 5\\) gives a remainder \\(3\\) (since \\(120\\) is divisible by \\(5\\) leaving \\(3\\)).\n4. \\(1234 \\div 5\\) gives a remainder \\(4\\) (since \\(1230\\) is divisible by \\(5\\) and \\(1234 - 1230 = 4\\)).\n5. \\(12345 \\div 5\\) gives a remainder \\(0\\) (since \\(12345\\) ends in \\(5\\), it\u2019s divisible by \\(5\\)).\n6. \\(123456 \\div 5\\) gives a remainder \\(1\\) (since the last digit, \\(6\\), causes the remainder \\(1\\)).\n7. \\(1234567 \\div 5\\) gives a remainder \\(2\\) (last digit \\(7\\) causes remainder \\(2\\)).\n8. \\(12345678 \\div 5\\) gives a remainder \\(3\\) (last digit \\(8\\) causes remainder \\(3\\)).\n\n### Step 3: Summing and Reflecting\nAlright, so let's add up those remainders:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 16 \\]\n\nNow I need to determine the remainder when this sum \\(16\\) is divided by \\(5\\). \n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\\[ 16 \\div 5 \\] gives a remainder of \\(1\\) (since \\(16 = 5 \\times 3 + 1\\)).\n\n### Final Check\nThat sounds reasonable - simple division confirmed that each part was broken down correctly and double-checked by revisiting basic modulo principles. Looks like the pattern holds, and calculations were executed accurately.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe remainder of the sum \\(1 + 12 + 123 + 1234 + 12345 + 123456 + 1234567 + 12345678\\) when divided by \\(5\\) is \\(1\\).\n\nReflecting on the solution, stepping through each component separately certainly helped clarify, and the pattern across the numbers made sense. That method worked out well.",
