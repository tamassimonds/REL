    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nLooking at the polynomial equation \\(3x^4 - x + 12 = 0\\), it seems like a typical problem where we're asked to find a sum involving the roots. The expression \\(pqr + pqs + prs + qrs\\) reminds me of a symmetric sum of roots product in polynomial equations, which suggests that this could be approached via Vieta's formulas. Vieta's gives us relationships between the coefficients of a polynomial and sums and products of its roots. But there are four roots, and the polynomial has only three tunable coefficients, so this might require more insight.\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n1. **Identify the Polynomial Degree:**\n   The polynomial is of degree 4, suggesting there are four roots: \\(p, q, r, s\\).\n\n2. **Vieta\u2019s Formulas:**\n   Let's recall Vieta\u2019s formulas. For a polynomial of the form \\(ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0,\\) the sum and products of the roots, expressed in terms of the coefficients, are:\n   - \\(p + q + r + s = -\\frac{b}{a} = 0\\) (since \\(b = 0\\)),\n   - \\(pq + pr + ps + qr + qs + rs = \\frac{c}{a} = 0\\) (since \\(c = 0\\)),\n   - \\(pqr + pqs + prs + qrs = -\\frac{d}{a} = \\frac{1}{3}\\),\n   - \\(pqrs = \\frac{e}{a} = -\\frac{12}{3} = -4\\).\n\n   Ah! Here we go. The value we need is \\(pqr + pqs + prs + qrs\\), which from Vieta's formulas, is actually \\(-\\frac{d}{a} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n**Reassess and Verify:**\n\n3. **Sanity Check:**\n   - **Dimensions Match:** Yes, we have 4 roots, and shuffle any three of them; the product is captured by \\(-\\frac{d}{a}\\).\n   - **Value from Vieta Matches:** It seems straightforward. The \\(-x\\) term in the polynomial contributes \\(-1\\) to the coefficient \\(d\\), making \\(-\\frac{(-1)}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n4. **Possible Errors:**\n   What if I misunderstood the coefficient labels? Let's see if reviewing polynomial categories like quadratic, cubic, and quartic solidifies correctness, but the polynomial nature and process apply similarly. I feel confident that the calculations look appropriate.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:**\n   Everything aligns: no missing steps, and Vieta's provides a straightforward path. I think the substitution directly applies here.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy leveraging Vieta\u2019s formulas and evaluating the third-order symmetric sum, we find \\(pqr + pqs + prs + qrs = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nThis answers the given question, consistent with the polynomial's defined structure. All calculations agree with polynomial properties, maintaining typical symmetry observed in such problems.",
