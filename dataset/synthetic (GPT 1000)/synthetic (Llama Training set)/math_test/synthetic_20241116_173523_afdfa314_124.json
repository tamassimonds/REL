It sounds straightforward, but let's be careful and precise so there's no mix-up.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Calculate $\\dfrac{1}{100}$ of $9000$:**\n\nThinking about how to find $\\dfrac{1}{100}$ of a number... oh, right! This is just like finding the percentage of a number, specifically 1%. \n\n- So, $\\dfrac{1}{100}$ is the same as multiplying by 0.01.\n- I should calculate $0.01 \\times 9000$.\n\nDoing the multiplication:\n\n\\[ \n0.01 \\times 9000 = 90 \n\\]\n\nAlright, that seems right. $90$ is 1% (or $\\frac{1}{100}$) of $9000$. Quick check: $9000 \\div 100 = 90$. Yep, that confirms it.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculate one half of 90:**\n\nNow the problem is down to finding one half of $90$. This might just be straightforward division by 2. Let's do it.\n\n- One half is just dividing by 2, so:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{90}{2} = 45 \n\\]\n\nSeems simple enough. $45$ is half of $90$.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nAfter walking through the calculations: \n- I confirmed $\\dfrac{1}{100}$ of $9000$ is $90$. \n- Then I checked that one half of $90$ is $45$.\n\nThis makes intuitive sense and all the calculations check out, so I'm confident that the answer is $45$. \n\nActually, reflecting on this, it all ties nicely together because each step broke down cleanly without strange results or odd numbers that didn't fit properly.\n\nUltimately, the answer to one half of $\\dfrac{1}{100}$ of $9000$ is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{45}\n\\]",
