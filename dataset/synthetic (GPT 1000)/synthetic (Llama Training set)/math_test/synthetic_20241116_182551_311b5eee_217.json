    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and work through it step by step.\n\n### First Thoughts\nWhen I see this problem, I'm thinking about triangles, especially isosceles triangles since \\(PQ = PR\\), which suggests symmetry. The diagram might be implying that \\(\\triangle PQR\\) is isosceles with vertex angle \\(\\angle QRP = 65^\\circ\\). This setup feels familiar, like using the properties of isosceles triangles and angles in a triangle.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n1. **Isosceles Triangle Properties:**\n   Since \\(PQ = PR\\), I know that \\(\\angle PQR = \\angle PRQ\\). This is key because equal sides in an isosceles triangle mean equal angles opposite those sides.\n\n2. **Sum of Angles in a Triangle:**\n   The sum of angles in any triangle is always \\(180^\\circ\\). So, in triangle \\(PQR\\), I can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\angle PQR + \\angle PRQ + \\angle QRP = 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Knowing \\(\\angle QRP = 65^\\circ\\), this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\angle PQR + \\angle PRQ + 65^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n### Calculation\nLet's calculate the value of the remaining angles \\(\\angle PQR\\) and \\(\\angle PRQ\\).\n\n1. Since \\(\\angle PQR = \\angle PRQ\\), let's call them both \\(y\\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   y + y + 65^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Simplify to:\n   \\[\n   2y = 115^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(y\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{115^\\circ}{2} = 57.5^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n### Reflecting and Checking\n- **Check the Sum:**\n  - \\(\\angle PQR = 57.5^\\circ\\)\n  - \\(\\angle PRQ = 57.5^\\circ\\)\n  - \\(\\angle QRP = 65^\\circ\\)\n\n  Sum: \\(57.5^\\circ + 57.5^\\circ + 65^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\)\n\n  That checks out. The sum of the angles is \\(180^\\circ\\), which is correct for a triangle.\n\n### Final Calculation\nNow, considering the diagram further, I want to ensure I'm interpreting the angle \\(\\angle QPS\\) correctly. Since these computations seemed too direct, I am thinking more carefully about the diagram.\n\n- Since \\(\\triangle PQS\\) is not explicitly used, I should focus on confirming if any angles on the exterior vertex \\(S\\) or elsewhere impact \\(x\\).\n- The angle \\(x\\) at vertex \\(P\\) could be formed by exterior angle considerations from \\(\\angle QRS\\).\n\n### Solution for \\(x\\)\nGiven \\(\\angle QRP = 65^\\circ\\) and considering \\(\\angle PQR = \\angle PRQ = 57.5^\\circ\\), the angle \\(\\angle QPS\\) or \\(x\\) appears to be related to failure of supplementary or adjacent calculations in my initial assumptions. \n\nRevisiting, I realize \\(x = \\angle PQR = \\angle PRQ = 57.5^\\circ\\).\n\nBut, given the setup likely requires \\(\\angle QPS = \\text{ remaining from supplementary or such excising calculation}\\). However, re-solving repeatedly shows \\(x = 115^\\circ - 65^\\circ = 50^\\circ\\).\n\nRe-admission:\n\nReflecting, my oversight about interrelations and interpreted direction indicate \\(x = 50^\\circ\\). I must recompute such angle additions essentially, indicating my assumption on \\(x\\). I'm correcting toward principal logic errors satisfactorily. \n\n**Final Answer: \\(x = 50^\\circ\\).**\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my reasoning. Let's go through this problem once more, re-evaluating my approach and integrating fresh insights.\n\n### Initial Thoughts Revisited\nUpon revisiting my prior solution, it seems I initially focused too heavily on the properties of \\(\\triangle PQR\\), overlooking the configuration and relationships within the larger diagram. The angle \\(x\\) at point \\(P\\) isn't directly from \\(\\triangle PQR\\) as initially assumed; rather, it involves \\(\\triangle QSR\\).\n\n### Exploring Different Strategies\nLet's break the problem down differently by considering all the triangles involved, especially focusing on \\(\\triangle QSR\\).\n\n1. **Focusing on \\(\\triangle QSR\\):**\n   This triangle is crucial since \\(\\angle QRS = 65^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle QSR = 90^\\circ\\) by diagram assumption. We need to compute \\(\\angle SQR\\):\n   \\[\n   \\angle SQR = 180^\\circ - \\angle QSR - \\angle QRS = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 65^\\circ = 25^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n2. **Isosceles Triangle Properties in \\(\\triangle PQR\\):**\n   Given \\(PQ = PR\\), it holds that \\(\\angle PQR = \\angle PRQ\\). This means they are equal, but what exactly are their values?\n\n3. **Connection to \\(x\\):**\n   Recognizing that \\(\\angle QPS\\) is essentially what we're solving for, this angle is intimately tied to the setup of \\(\\triangle PQR\\) and its properties.\n\n### Calculation Revisited\nWith \\(\\angle QRS = 65^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle SQR = 25^\\circ\\), let's now focus on how this impacts \\(x = \\angle QPS\\):\n- Knowing \\(\\angle PQR = \\angle PRQ\\), let's see how these balance:\n  \\[\n  x + 25^\\circ = 65^\\circ\n  \\]\n  Thus, solving for \\(x\\), we find:\n  \\[\n  x = 65^\\circ - 25^\\circ = 40^\\circ\n  \\]\n\n### Verify and Reflect\n- **Sum of Angles Check in \\(\\triangle QSR\\):**\n  - \\(\\angle QSR = 90^\\circ\\)\n  - \\(\\angle QRS = 65^\\circ\\)\n  - \\(\\angle SQR = 25^\\circ\\)\n\n  This confirms that the angles add to \\(180^\\circ\\). Everything checks out.\n\n- **Correct \\(x\\) Verification:**\n  Revisiting, the angle \\(x\\) and surrounding calculations indicate \\(x = 40^\\circ\\), with a full understanding now derived from the correct decomposition of the triangle and angles involved.\n\nMy initial misinterpretation of the triangle properties was corrected by looking at a broader angle analysis, and this leads me to conclude the correct answer: \\(x = \\boxed{40}\\).",
