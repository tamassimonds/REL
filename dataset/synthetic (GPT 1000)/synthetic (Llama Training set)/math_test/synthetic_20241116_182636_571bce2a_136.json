    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- Looking at the problem, I immediately recognize this involves binomial expansion. Hmm, this looks like it should be straightforward, but with two different binomials being added. I need to find the specific term \\(x^2y^2\\) in the expansion of both \\((x+y)^4\\) and \\((x+2y)^4\\).\n\nInitial Strategy:\n- I could expand both binomials using the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem tells us that \\((a+b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\\). I should use this formula to target the \\(x^2y^2\\) term in both expansions separately.\n  \nStep 1: Expand \\((x+y)^4\\).\n- Using the Binomial Theorem: \n  \\[\n  (x+y)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} x^{4-k} y^k\n  \\]\n- I'm focusing on finding the term where \\(x^2y^2\\) appears, meaning \\(4-k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Thus, the specific term is:\n  \\[\n  \\binom{4}{2} x^{4-2} y^2 = \\binom{4}{2} x^2 y^2\n  \\]\n- Calculate \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\\).\n- So, the term from \\((x+y)^4\\) is \\(6x^2y^2\\).\n\nQuick Check:\n- Okay, this seems right. I used binomial expansion correctly, and calculated the combinations. Good to move on to the next part.\n\nStep 2: Expand \\((x+2y)^4\\).\n- Again using the Binomial Theorem: \n  \\[\n  (x+2y)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} x^{4-k} (2y)^k\n  \\]\n- I need to solve for the term where \\(x^2y^2\\) appears. The conditions are again \\(4-k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).\n- Substitute into the expansion formula:\n  \\[\n  \\binom{4}{2} x^{4-2} (2y)^2 = \\binom{4}{2} x^2 (4y^2)\n  \\]\n- The coefficient here becomes \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\).\n- The term from \\((x+2y)^4\\) is \\(24x^2y^2\\).\n\nReflect:\n- Oh! I think this matches the logic and steps. I calculated the binomial coefficients twice and found the individual terms accurately.\n\nStep 3: Combine Results.\n- Add the coefficients of \\(x^2y^2\\) from both expansions since the problem is asking about the sum of these expansions.\n- Total coefficient is \\(6 + 24 = 30\\).\n\nFinal Reflection:\n- Everything checks out. I used the binomial theorem correctly and made sure the terms were combined correctly. The coefficient of \\(x^2y^2\\) in the expansion of \\((x+y)^4 + (x+2y)^4\\) is \\(30\\). I\u2019m confident in this answer. Yay!",

  "ground_truth": "To find the coefficient of $x^2y^2$, we can find the coefficient in each of the 4th powers. These are the only things that can contribute $x^2y^2$ terms to the final expansion.\n\nThe expansion of $(x+y)^4$ will have a coefficient of $\\binom{4}{2}$ for $x^2y^2$, by the Binomial Theorem.\n\nThe expansion of $(x+2y)^4$ will have a coefficient of $2^2\\binom{4}{2}$ for $x^2y^2$.\n\nThus the coefficient of $x^2y^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^4+(x+2y)^4$ will be $\\binom{4}{2}+4\\binom{4}{2}=\\boxed{30}$."
