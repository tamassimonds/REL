    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem by exploring the steps comprehensively. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\nWhen I first see this problem, I notice that the function \\( f(x) \\) behaves differently for rational and irrational numbers. This distinction is important and is likely crucial for solving the problem. The specified operations \\(|\\lfloor{x}\\rfloor|\\) for rationals and \\(\\lceil{x}\\rceil^2\\) for irrationals tell me that I'll need to handle these two types of numbers separately. \n\nLet's look at each argument inside \\(f\\) one by one:\n\n1. **\\(f(\\sqrt[3]{-8})\\):**\n\n   - **Recognizing \\( \\sqrt[3]{-8} \\):** \n     - This is the cube root of \\(-8\\), which is \\(-2\\) because \\((-2)^3 = -8\\).\n     - Thus, \\(\\sqrt[3]{-8} = -2\\).\n\n   - **Determine Rationality:**\n     - \\( -2 \\) is clearly a rational number.\n\n   - **Apply \\( f(x) \\) for Rationals:**\n     - Since the function for rationals is \\(|\\lfloor{x}\\rfloor|\\), and \\(\\lfloor -2 \\rfloor = -2\\), we have \\(|-2| = 2\\).\n\n   Confidently, \\( f(\\sqrt[3]{-8}) = 2 \\).\n\n2. **\\(f(-\\pi)\\):**\n\n   - **Recognizing \\(-\\pi\\):** \n     - \\(\\pi\\) is generally known to be an irrational number, therefore \\(-\\pi\\) is also irrational.\n\n   - **Apply \\( f(x) \\) for Irrationals:** \n     - The function specifies \\(\\lceil{x}\\rceil^2\\) for irrationals.\n     - \\(\\lceil -\\pi \\rceil\\) is \\(-3\\) because \\(-3\\) is the smallest integer \\(\\geq -\\pi\\).\n     - Thus, we have \\((-3)^2 = 9\\).\n\n   Therefore, \\( f(-\\pi) = 9 \\).\n\n3. **\\(f(\\sqrt{50})\\):**\n\n   - **Recognizing \\(\\sqrt{50}\\):**\n     - \\( \\sqrt{50} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 2} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\), and \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational, thus \\( \\sqrt{50} \\) remains irrational.\n\n   - **Apply \\( f(x) \\) for Irrationals:**\n     - Using \\(\\lceil{x}\\rceil^2\\), let's calculate \\(\\lceil \\sqrt{50} \\rceil\\).\n     - Since \\(7^2 = 49 < 50 < 64 = 8^2\\), \\(\\sqrt{50} \\approx 7.07\\), so \\(\\lceil \\sqrt{50} \\rceil = 8\\).\n     - Therefore, \\( 8^2 = 64 \\).\n\n   Confident check: \\( f(\\sqrt{50}) = 64 \\).\n\n4. **\\(f\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)\\):**\n\n   - **Recognizing \\(\\frac{9}{2}\\):**\n     - Expresses as \\(4.5\\), obviously a rational number.\n\n   - **Apply \\( f(x) \\) for Rationals:**\n     - Calculate \\(\\lfloor \\frac{9}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 4.5 \\rfloor = 4\\).\n     - So, \\(|4| = 4\\).\n\n   Thus, \\( f\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right) = 4 \\).\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nNow, let's sum these \\( f \\) values:\n\n\\[ f(\\sqrt[3]{-8}) + f(-\\pi) + f(\\sqrt{50}) + f\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right) = 2 + 9 + 64 + 4 = 79. \\]\n\n**Verification & Reflection:**\nDouble-checking each step, I re-evaluated the arithmetic and logical pathways, ensuring the rational/irrational distinction was handled properly. Everything checks out smoothly, so I confidently conclude that the final sum is \\(79\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since we know that $\\sqrt[3]{-8}=-2$ is a rational number, $$f(\\sqrt[3]{-8})=|\\lfloor{-2}\\rfloor|=2.$$Continuing from here, we know that $-\\pi$ is irrational, thus $$f(-\\pi)=\\lceil{-\\pi}\\rceil^2=(-3)^2=9.$$Because 50 is not a perfect square, $\\sqrt{50}$ must be irrational as well, so $$f(\\sqrt{50})=\\lceil{\\sqrt{50}}\\rceil^2=8^2=64.$$Finally, we know that $\\frac{9}{2}$ is a rational number, so $$f\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)=\\left|\\left\\lfloor{\\frac92}\\right\\rfloor\\right|=4.$$Therefore $$f(\\sqrt[3]{-8})+f(-\\pi)+f(\\sqrt{50})+f\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)=2+9+64+4=\\boxed{79}.$$"
