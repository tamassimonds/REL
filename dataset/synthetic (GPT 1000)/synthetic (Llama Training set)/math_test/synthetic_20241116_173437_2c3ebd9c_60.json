    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and work through it step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Function and Its Domain\nThe function given is \n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2-7} + \\frac{1}{x^3-8} + \\frac{1}{x^4-9}. \\]\n\nThe domain of a function is essentially the set of all real numbers \\( x \\) for which the function is defined. Here, we have to ensure that no denominator is zero, since division by zero is undefined. This means we need to find values of \\( x \\) which lead to any of the individual denominators equaling zero.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Denominator Constraints\nLet's examine each term individually:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{1}{x^2-7}\\): For this term, the denominator is zero when \\( x^2 - 7 = 0 \\). Solving for \\( x \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 7 \\implies x = \\pm\\sqrt{7}.\n   \\]\n\n2. \\(\\frac{1}{x^3-8}\\): The denominator is zero when \\( x^3 - 8 = 0 \\). Solving for \\( x \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   x^3 = 8 \\implies x = 2.\n   \\]\n\n3. \\(\\frac{1}{x^4-9}\\): For this term, the denominator is zero when \\( x^4 - 9 = 0 \\). Solving for \\( x \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   x^4 = 9 \\implies x^2 = 3 \\implies x = \\pm\\sqrt{3}.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Sum Up Values Not in the Domain\nNow that we have identified the problem points (values not in the domain), we need the sum of all these real numbers:\n\n- From \\(\\frac{1}{x^2-7}\\): \\( x = \\sqrt{7}, -\\sqrt{7} \\).\n- From \\(\\frac{1}{x^3-8}\\): \\( x = 2 \\).\n- From \\(\\frac{1}{x^4-9}\\): \\( x = \\sqrt{3}, -\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nThe next step is calculating the sum \\( \\sqrt{7} + (-\\sqrt{7}) + 2 + \\sqrt{3} + (-\\sqrt{3}) \\).\n\n### Step 4: Simplify and Calculate\nSimplifying the sum, observe that:\n\n- \\(\\sqrt{7} + (-\\sqrt{7}) = 0\\),\n- \\(\\sqrt{3} + (-\\sqrt{3}) = 0\\).\n\nThus, the remaining part of the sum is:\n\\[\n2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Check and Reflect\nLet's make sure there\u2019s no oversight in finding zero denominators and calculating sums. All findings match the conditions, and each part of the function has been examined.\n\nTherefore, **the sum of all real numbers \\( x \\) that are not in the domain of the function** is \\(\\boxed{2}\\). \n\nThis should be right logically, as based on each denominator's value, not yielding any surprises or extra terms needing consideration. This feels like a thorough check, and I am confident that the solution makes sense!",

  "ground_truth": "A real number $x$ is in the domain of $f(x)$ unless $x^2=7$, $x^3=8$, or $x^4=9$.\n\nThe solutions to $x^2=7$ are $x=\\sqrt 7$ and $x=-\\sqrt 7$, which sum to $0$.\n\nThe only solution to $x^3=8$ is $x=2$.\n\nThe solutions to $x^4=9$ are $x=\\sqrt[4]9$ and $x=-\\sqrt[4]9$, which sum to $0$.\n\nThus, the sum of all $x$ not in the domain of $f$ is $0+2+0=\\boxed{2}$."
