    "working_out": "Alright, let's take a deep dive into solving this problem. Here we go:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe given polynomial \\(x^{23} + 23x^{17} - 18x^{16} - 24x^{15} + 108x^{14}\\) must be divisible by \\(x^4 - 3x^2 - 2x + 9\\) for all values of \\(x\\). Our task is to find the sum of the coefficients of \\(P(x)\\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Problem\nFirst thought: Divisibility indicates that the quotient \\(P(x)\\) extracted from dividing the main polynomial by \\(x^4 - 3x^2 - 2x + 9\\) should be a polynomial, simplifying our task to finding \\(P(x)\\).\n\nThe degree of the dividend polynomial is 23, and the divisor polynomial \\(x^4 - 3x^2 - 2x + 9\\) has degree 4. By polynomial division, the degree of \\(P(x)\\) should be \\(23 - 4 = 19\\).\n\n### Step 3: Dividing the Polynomials\nWe perform polynomial long division, dividing:\n\n\\[x^{23} + 23x^{17} - 18x^{16} - 24x^{15} + 108x^{14}\\]\n\nby\n\n\\[x^4 - 3x^2 - 2x + 9.\\]\n\n**First Term:**\n- Divide \\(x^{23}\\) by \\(x^4\\), the leading coefficient: The first term of \\(P(x)\\) is \\(x^{19}\\).\n\n**Next:**\n- Multiply the entire divisor by \\(x^{19}\\) and subtract.\n- Repeat this for the subsequent terms (though listing each step might be unnecessarily long, as we recognized symmetry patterns).\n\n### Step 4: Symmetry and Further Thoughts\nWhoa wait, repeating this without real purpose isn't efficient \u2014 Hmm, perhaps thinking through how to form \\(P(x)\\) otherwise. Perhaps just finding patterns in coefficients is a better approach.\n\n### Step 5: Reconsider and Use Symmetry or Properties\nReflecting: To find the sum of coefficients of \\(P(x)\\), substitute \\(x = 1\\) into the expression for \\(x^{23} + 23x^{17} - 18x^{16} - 24x^{15} + 108x^{14}\\) because the constant term of \\(P(x)\\) will account for the division by the constant term of the divisor.\n\n**Compute:**\n\\[1^{23} + 23 \\times 1^{17} - 18 \\times 1^{16} - 24 \\times 1^{15} + 108 \\times 1^{14}.\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[1 + 23 - 18 - 24 + 108 = 90.\\]\n\nBut the divisor at \\(x = 1\\) is:\n\\[1^4 - 3 \\times 1^2 - 2 \\times 1 + 9 = 1 - 3 - 2 + 9 = 5.\\]\n\nThe sum of the coefficients of \\(P(x)\\) will be:\n\\[\\frac{90}{5} = 18.\\]\n\n### Step 6: Double Check\nLet me think about whether this approach makes sense logically, yes: Polynomial division by substituting \\(x = 1\\) did bypass cumbersome evaluation \u2014 excellent!\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the sum of the coefficients of \\(P(x)\\) is \\(\\boxed{18}\\).\n\nNow this makes me curious if naturally, polynomial theory can offer further shortcuts; but for it stands, the use above appears sound.",
