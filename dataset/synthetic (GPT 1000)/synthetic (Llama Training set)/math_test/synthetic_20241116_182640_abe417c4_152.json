    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by taking it step-by-step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nOkay, we want to find \\( q(x) \\) so that the function \\(\\frac{4x - x^3}{q(x)}\\) meets certain conditions: a hole at \\( x = -2 \\), a vertical asymptote at \\( x = 1 \\), no horizontal asymptote, and \\( q(3) = -30 \\).\n\nMy first thought is that a hole in the graph of a rational function at \\( x = -2 \\) means the numerator and the denominator have a common factor that vanishes at \\( x = -2 \\). \n\nA vertical asymptote at \\( x = 1 \\) implies that the denominator has a factor that vanishes at \\( x = 1 \\) but the numerator does not, assuming there is no hole at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nNo horizontal asymptote reminds me that the degree of the polynomial in the numerator must be greater than the degree of the polynomial in the denominator.\n\n### Brainstorming\n- It seems logical that \\( q(x) \\) should have \\( (x + 2) \\) as a factor to account for the hole at \\( x = -2 \\).\n- \\( q(x) \\) must have \\( (x - 1) \\) as a factor to ensure a vertical asymptote at \\( x = 1 \\).\n- Reflecting on \"no horizontal asymptote,\" we conclude the degree of \\( q(x) \\) must be less than \\( x^3 \\) (since the numerator is degree 3, it shouldn't balance out unless there\u2019s a polynomial of degree 3 on the bottom). \n\n### Constructing \\( q(x) \\)\nFirst, include both identified factors: \\( q(x) = (x + 2)(x - 1) \\cdot p(x) \\), where \\( p(x) \\) is some polynomial. We aim for \\( \\deg(q(x)) < 3 \\).\n\nReflect: Two linear factors are introduced, so we can make \\( p(x) \\) a constant (degree 0) to keep \\( \\deg(q(x)) = 2 \\).\n\nStart simple: \n\\[ q(x) = c(x + 2)(x - 1) \\]\n\n### Determine Constant \\( c \\)\n\nUse the condition \\( q(3) = -30 \\):\n\\[ q(3) = c(3 + 2)(3 - 1) = -30 \\]\n\\[ c(5)(2) = -30 \\]\n\\[ 10c = -30 \\]\n\\[ c = -3 \\]\n\n### Verifying our Approach\n\nLet's validate each condition:\n\n1. **Hole at \\( x = -2 \\)**:\n   - \\( q(x) = -3(x + 2)(x - 1) \\) has a factor \\( (x + 2) \\).\n\n2. **Vertical asymptote at \\( x = 1 \\)**:\n   - \\( q(x) \\) includes \\( (x - 1) \\), and that\u2019s not canceled in the numerator, validating an asymptote. Check: Answer is consistent.\n\n3. **No horizontal asymptote**:\n   - The degree of the numerator, 3, is greater than the degree of the denominator, 2. Check: Answer is consistent.\n\n4. **Condition \\( q(3) = -30 \\)**:\n   - We calculated \\( c = -3 \\) with this in mind. \n\n### Conclusion\nThe function \\( q(x) = -3(x + 2)(x - 1) \\) satisfies all the given conditions. Reflecting confirms everything checks out: hole, asymptote, and degree criteria are all satisfied. I'll double-check in case any condition was misunderstood, but all seems to align with the task.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the graph has no horizontal asymptote, $q(x)$ must have degree less than $3.$ We can factor the numerator of our given function as $4x-x^3 = x(2+x)(2-x).$ Then, since the graph has a hole at $x=-2,$ then $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x+2.$\n\nSince the graph has a vertical asymptote at $x=1,$ it must have a factor of $x-1.$ Hence, $q(x) = a(x+2)(x-1)$ for some constant $a.$\n\nWe know $q(3) = -30.$ Then, $a(3+2)(3-1) = -30,$ which we can solve to get $a=-3.$ Thus, $q(x) = \\boxed{-3(x+2)(x-1)} = -3x^2-3x+6.$"
