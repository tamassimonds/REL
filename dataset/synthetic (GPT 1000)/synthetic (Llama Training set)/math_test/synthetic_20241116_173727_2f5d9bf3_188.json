    "working_out": "First thoughts: This problem involves two squares that are coplanar and adjacent, with a point on the intersection of segments between the squares. It sounds like a geometric problem that might be solved using coordinate geometry or vector methods, but first, let's try to visualize the scenario and understand what is being asked.\n\nInitial Brainstorming: \n- We have two squares: \\(ABGH\\) with side length 5, and \\(BCDF\\) with side length 10, sharing side \\(BC\\).\n- Point \\(E\\) is on segments \\(AD\\) and \\(GB\\). To calculate the area of triangle \\(ABE\\), we need the coordinates of point \\(E\\).\n- Hmm, \\(E\\) is on the line segments, which seems challenging because it introduces some dependency on the position.\n\nLet's consider placing this on a coordinate grid:\n- Place point \\(A\\) at \\((0, 0)\\), then:\n  - \\(B = (5, 0)\\)\n  - \\(G = (5, 5)\\), \\(H = (0, 5)\\)\n  - \\(C = (15, 0)\\), since BC is a shared edge of the squares\n  - \\(D = (15, 10)\\), moving vertically up from \\(C\\).\n\nAlright, the placement makes sense visually.\n\nCoordinate check:\n- By choosing such placements, all vertices fit the squares' properties. \\(CD = 10\\) works, and \\(AH = 5\\) matches. So the initial setup is correct.\n\nNext, locate point \\(E\\):\n- Given \\(E\\) lies on segment \\(AD\\) and on segment \\(GB\\).\n- The parametric line for \\(AD\\) is \\((x, y) = (15t, 10t)\\) for \\(0 \\le t \\le 1\\).\n- The line for \\(GB\\) is \\((x, y) = (5, 5 - 5s)\\) for \\(0 \\le s \\le 1\\).\n\nFind intersection:\n- Equating \\(x\\) coordinates: \\(15t = 5\\), thus \\(t = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n- Equating \\(y\\) coordinates: \\(10t = 5 - 5s\\); substituting \\(t\\):\n  \\[\n  10 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 5 - 5s \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{10}{3} = 5 - 5s\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  5s = 5 - \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{15}{3} - \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  s = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n- Consistency is shown as \\(s = t\\).\n\nThus, \\(E = (5, \\frac{10}{3})\\).\n\nCheck through the area calculation of \\( \\triangle ABE \\):\n- Use formula for area of triangle given vertices \\((x_1, y_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2)\\), \\((x_3, y_3)\\): \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\lvert x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\rvert\n  \\]\n- Plug points \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (5, 0)\\), \\(E = (5, \\frac{10}{3})\\):\n\nCalculations:\n- Area = \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\lvert 0(0 - \\frac{10}{3}) + 5(\\frac{10}{3} - 0) + 5(0 - 0) \\rvert\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{50}{3} = \\frac{25}{3} \n  \\]\n\nReflect:\n- Seems correct: \\(E\\) is correctly placed, and calculations align step by step.\n\nFinal answer:\n- The area of triangle \\(ABE\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{25}{3}}\\) square units.",

  "ground_truth": "The area of triangle $ACD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(AC)(DC) = \\frac{1}{2}(5+10)(10) = 75$. Triangle $ABE$ is similar to triangle $ACD$, with ratio of similitude $AB/AC = 5/15 = 1/3$. So the ratio of their areas is $(1/3)^2 = 1/9$, so the area of $ABE$ is $(1/9)(75) = \\boxed{\\frac{25}{3}}$."
