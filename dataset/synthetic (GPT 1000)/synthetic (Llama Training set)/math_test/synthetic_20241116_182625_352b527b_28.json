The mention of arithmetic mean immediately brings to mind that I need to find the sum of these numbers and divide by the quantity of numbers to equal the mean, which is 9. That seems straightforward, but let's not rush and ensure we take this piece by piece.\n\n**Understanding the Mean**\n\nThe arithmetic mean is the sum of a set of numbers divided by the number of numbers. Here, I have four numbers: 7, 2, \\( x \\), and 10. Seriously, whenever I've encountered problems involving the arithmetic mean, it often involves setting up an equation that reflects this mean calculation.\n\n**Setting Up the Equation**\n\nSo, based on my understanding, the equation for the mean here would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7 + 2 + x + 10}{4} = 9\n\\]\n\nI'm already feeling like this setup looks familiar and workable. Let's simplify it and solve.\n\n**Solving the Equation**\n\n1. First, combine the known numbers in the numerator:\n\n   \\[\n   7 + 2 + 10 = 19\n   \\]\n\n   So the equation becomes:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{19 + x}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, to eliminate the fraction, I'll multiply both sides by 4:\n\n   \\[\n   19 + x = 36\n   \\]\n\n   This multiplication looks sound since it clears up the fraction, focusing directly on the numbers involved.\n\n3. Now, solve for \\( x \\):\n\n   \\[\n   x = 36 - 19\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   x = 17\n   \\]\n\n**Reflecting and Checking**\n\nNow that I've found \\( x \\) to be 17, let me verify that this fits the problem conditions. Substitute back:\n\n- The numbers are 7, 2, 17, and 10.\n- Their sum: \\( 7 + 2 + 17 + 10 = 36 \\)\n- Divide by 4 to get the mean: \\( \\frac{36}{4} = 9 \\)\n\nYes, the arithmetic mean is indeed 9, matching the given condition, and confirming that my solution is correct.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGreat, this means the value of \\( x \\) must indeed be 17. This feels correct because all steps checked out, and the arithmetic operations were straightforward without any logical missteps.\n\nThrough this meticulous, reflective process, I've ensured the correct resolution to the problem, embodying the usual ins and outs of my problem-solving approach.",

  "ground_truth": "If those 4 numbers average to 9, they must sum to $4\\times 9 = 36$.  Then, we simply subtract the other three numbers from 36: $36 - 7 - 2 - 10 = \\boxed{17} = x$."
