However, I remember dealing with similar problems by finding a common denominator to combine the fractions. That might be a good place to start. Let me quickly brainstorm:\n\n- **Could I eliminate the fractions?** Absolutely, by finding a common denominator.\n- **Do the terms have a common factor or something that can be simplified right off the bat?** Well, the denominator 3 and 4 remind me of finding least common multiples.\n\nAlright! Let\u2019s choose a strategy and begin.\n\n### Step 1: Find a Common Denominator\n\nThe fractions \\(\\frac{x}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{x}{4}\\) need a common denominator:\n\n- The denominators are 3 and 4, and I need the least common multiple (LCM).\n- The LCM of 3 and 4 is 12. \n\nGreat, I'll convert each term to have this common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{3} = \\frac{4x}{12} \\quad \\text{(since multiplying numerator and denominator by 4)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{4} = \\frac{3x}{12} \\quad \\text{(since multiplying numerator and denominator by 3)}\n\\]\n\nNow, I can rewrite the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x}{12} + \\frac{3x}{12} = 14\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Combine the Fractions\n\nSince both fractions have the same denominator, I can combine them easily:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x + 3x}{12} = 14\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7x}{12} = 14\n\\]\n\nThis feels right! Let me do a quick check: Yeah, combining like terms in the numerator should result in 7x because that's how basic algebraic addition works.\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\(x\\)\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, I'll multiply both sides of the equation by 12:\n\n\\[\n7x = 14 \\times 12 \n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the right side:\n\n\\[\n14 \\times 12 = 168\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n7x = 168\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), I'll divide both sides by 7:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{168}{7}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nx = 24\n\\]\n\n### Check the Solution\n\nLet me verify my solution:\n\n- Substitute \\(x = 24\\) back into the original equation: \n\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{3} + \\frac{24}{4} \n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n- \\(\\frac{24}{3} = 8\\)\n- \\(\\frac{24}{4} = 6\\)\n\nAdding them gives \\(8 + 6 = 14\\), which matches the right side of the original equation. \n\nPerfect! My solution makes sense.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe value of \\(x\\) is \\(24\\). The approach of combining like terms using a common denominator worked well, and a quick verification confirmed the correctness. This problem was an excellent exercise in managing fractions and algebraic manipulation!",

  "ground_truth": "To start, find a common denominator on the left side.  The lowest common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12, so this is the common denominator.  Rewrite the equation as: $$\\frac{4x}{12}+\\frac{3x}{12}=14$$$$\\frac{4x+3x}{12}=14$$$$\\frac{7x}{12}=14$$Now, multiply both sides of the equation by $\\frac{12}{7}$ to solve for $x$: $$\\frac{7x}{12}\\cdot\\frac{12}{7}=14\\cdot \\frac{12}{7}$$$$x=2\\cdot 12=\\boxed{24}$$"
