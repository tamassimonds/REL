    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, this looks like a piecewise function, and we're asked to find values of \\( k \\) for which the inverse is defined for all real numbers. The crucial part here is the condition that the inverse exists over the entire real number line, which gives us a clue that we need to pay attention to. Let's explore.\n\n### Brainstorming and Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Understand the Function**: \n   - The function \\( f(x) \\) is defined piecewise as:\n     - \\( f(x) = x + k \\) when \\( x < 4 \\).\n     - \\( f(x) = 2x - 3 \\) when \\( x \\ge 4 \\).\n   - We know too that an inverse is only possible if the function is bijective (both injective and surjective). This indicates that \\( f(x) \\) must be continuous and one-to-one.\n\n2. **Initial Thoughts**:\n   - I see that for \\( f(x) \\) to have an inverse, there must not be any overlap or \"jumps\" at the point \\( x = 4 \\). The function needs to smoothly connect at this point for \\( f \\) to be continuous.\n   - This might hint that the endpoints of the different expressions for \\( f(x) \\) are equal at \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n### Calculations and Exploration\n\n3. **Check Continuity at \\( x = 4 \\)**:\n   - For continuity at \\( x = 4 \\):\n     - From the left, \\( x + k = 4 + k \\).\n     - From the right, \\( 2(4) - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5 \\).\n   - Set these equal for continuity: \\( 4 + k = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Solve for \\( k \\)**:\n   - \\( 4 + k = 5 \\) implies \\( k = 1 \\).\n\n### Verification of One-to-One Nature\n\n5. **Check Injectiveness**:\n   - The functions \\( x + 1 \\) and \\( 2x - 3 \\) are both linear and thus one-to-one.\n   - However, we should ensure the overall function \\( f \\) is one-to-one across the piecewise split:\n   - Consider the derivatives:\n      - \\( f'(x) = 1 \\) for \\( x < 4 \\) and \\( f'(x) = 2 \\) for \\( x \\ge 4 \\).\n   - As these derivatives are non-zero and the slopes differ on the domains, the function is indeed one-to-one (strictly increasing).\n\n6. **Reflect and Double-Check**:\n   - With \\( k = 1 \\), the function is continuous and one-to-one through \\( x \\). The inverse function access across all real numbers confirms the conditions for an inverse to exist.\n   - Since there's no other way to align the function to maintain continuity and one-to-one property across \\( x = 4 \\), \\( k = 1 \\) is the only viable solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy ensuring continuity and injectiveness across the split point \\( x = 4 \\), we concluded that \\( k = 1 \\) allows the function \\( f(x) \\) to have an inverse defined for all real numbers. Thus, the possible value of \\( k \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",
