    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem!\n\nWhen I first see the question, my thought immediately goes to the fact that we're dealing with inverse functions. Since \\( f(x) = \\frac{2}{x+1} \\), we need to find the inverse function, \\( f^{-1}(y) \\), where \\( y = f(x) \\), and then evaluate it at \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\).\n\n### Initial Brainstorming\n\n1. **Understand the problem**: We're asked to find \\( f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\). This means we're looking for the value of \\( x \\) that makes the function \\( f(x) \\) equal to \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\).\n\n2. **Determine a strategy**: To solve this, we need to find the inverse of \\( f(x) = \\frac{2}{x+1} \\). This involves swapping \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the function equation and solving for \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Check inverse understanding**: Once I have the inverse function, I just need to plug in \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) to find \\( f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\).\n\n### Solving for the Inverse Function\n\n**Step 1: Set up the equation**\n\nStart with the original function:\n\\[ y = \\frac{2}{x+1} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Swap variables**\n\nTo find the inverse, exchange \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{2}{y+1} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( y \\)**\n\nThis is where I solve for \\( y \\) to get the inverse function:\n- Multiply both sides by \\( y+1 \\):\n  \\[ x(y + 1) = 2 \\]\n- Distribute the \\( x \\):\n  \\[ xy + x = 2 \\]\n- Isolate \\( xy \\):\n  \\[ xy = 2 - x \\]\n- Solve for \\( y \\):\n  \\[ y = \\frac{2 - x}{x} \\]\n\n**Thoughts**: Oh wait, let's be careful. It seems we need to break this down further to express it clearly:\n- \\( xy = 2 - x \\) simplifies as \\( y = \\frac{2}{x} - 1 \\).\n\nSo, the inverse function is:\n\\[ f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{2}{x} - 1 \\]\n\n### Evaluate the Inverse at \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)\n\nPlug \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) into the inverse function:\n\\[ f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{5}} - 1 \\]\n\n**Reflection on calculations**: Oh, dividing by a fraction involves multiplying by its reciprocal. So:\n\n\\[ f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 2 \\times 5 - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDouble-check: Does it make sense? If \\( f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 9 \\), then \\( f(9) \\) should equal \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\). Let's quickly verify:\n\\[ f(9) = \\frac{2}{9+1} = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5} \\]\n\nEverything checks out! So, \\( f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 9 \\).\n\nI'm happy with this answer\u2014it aligns with the initial function definition, and all operations seem to be conducted correctly!",

  "ground_truth": "$f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)$ is defined as the number $x$ such that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{5}$. Thus, we solve the equation $$\\frac{2}{x+1} = \\frac{1}{5}.$$Multiplying both sides by $5(x+1)$, we have $$10 = x+1.$$Subtracting $1$ from both sides gives $x=\\boxed{9}$."
