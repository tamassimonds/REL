    "working_out": "### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nOkay, let's dive in. We need to find the largest \\( n \\) such that \\( a = 2^{306} \\cdot 3^{340} \\) is a perfect \\( n \\)th power. This sounds related to concepts like exponents, divisibility, and perfect powers. I remember perfect powers from algebra; a number is a perfect \\( n \\)th power if it can be expressed as \\( x^n \\) for some integer \\( x \\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Strategies\n\n- First impression tells me this is about finding the highest exponent \\( n \\) that can evenly divide the exponents of both 2 and 3 in the expression \\( 2^{306} \\cdot 3^{340} \\).\n- Maybe exploring the method of dividing through the exponents using the greatest common divisor (GCD) might lead us somewhere.\n\n### Step 2: Recalling Mathematical Concepts\n\nLet's consider that:\n\n\\[ a = b^n \\]\n\nWhere \\( b = 2^x \\times 3^y \\). Then:\n\n\\[ a = (2^x \\times 3^y)^n = 2^{nx} \\times 3^{ny} \\]\n\nFor this to hold:\n\n- \\( nx = 306 \\) and\n- \\( ny = 340 \\)\n\nThis confirms our initial thought that \\( n \\) should be a divisor of both 306 and 340.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating GCD\n\n- Find \\( \\gcd(306, 340) \\).\n- Using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  340 & = 306 \\times 1 + 34 \\\\\n  306 & = 34 \\times 9 + 0 \n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n\nHere, \\( \\gcd(306, 340) = 34 \\).\n\n### Reflection\n\nOkay, if \\( n = 34 \\), both conditions \\( nx = 306 \\) and \\( ny = 340 \\) would be satisfied as 34 is the largest number that divides both 306 and 340. Let's verify:\n\n\\[ 306 \\div 34 = 9 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 340 \\div 34 = 10 \\]\n\nBoth results are integers, confirming \\( n = 34 \\).\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nSo, it appears our correct result is indeed that \\( n = 34 \\). It satisfies the division requirements, and every step checks out logically. Allowing \\( a = 2^{34 \\times 9} \\cdot 3^{34 \\times 10} \\), meaning \\( a \\) can indeed be expressed as \\( (2^9 \\cdot 3^{10})^{34} \\), where both 9 and 10 are integers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe largest \\( n \\) such that \\( a = 2^{306} \\cdot 3^{340} \\) is a perfect nth power is \\( \\boxed{34} \\). \n\nReflecting on the process, the key was recognizing the relationship of divisors and directly relating it to the greatest common divisor. Also, verifying step by step ensured accuracy, with confidence in the Euclidean approach, which is robust for this type of problem.",

  "ground_truth": "We claim that $a$ is a perfect $n$th power if and only if $n$ divides both $306$ and $340$. To see this, suppose that $n \\mid 306$ and $n \\mid 340$. Then $2^{\\frac{306}{n}} 3^{\\frac{340}{n}}$ is an integer whose $n$th power is $a$. Conversely, suppose $b^n = a$. Then the only primes which divide $b$ are $2$ and $3$. Choose $c$ and $d$ so that $b=2^{c} 3^{d}$. Then $b^n = 2^{cn} 3^{dn} = 2^{306} 3^{340}$, which implies $n \\mid 306$ and $n \\mid 340$. This concludes our proof of the claim that $a$ is an $n$th power if and only if $n$ divides both $306$ and $340$.\n\nThe largest number which simultaneously divides two numbers is their GCD. Using the Euclidean algorithm, the GCD of $306$ and $340$ is the same as the GCD of $340$ and $340-306 = 34$. Since $34$ divides $340$, the GCD of these two is $34$, so the largest possible $n$ is $\\boxed{34}$."
