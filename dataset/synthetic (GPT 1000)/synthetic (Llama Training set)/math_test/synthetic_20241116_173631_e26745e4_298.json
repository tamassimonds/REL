    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this question. The goal is to find the product of the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common factor (GCF, also known as the greatest common divisor, GCD) of the numbers 22 and 48. \n\nFirst thoughts: \n- This seems like a typical problem related to number properties, specifically factors and multiples. \n- I remember that there's a neat relationship between two numbers, their LCM, and GCD involving their product, but let me see if I recall it correctly.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the relationship between LCM and GCD**\n- From my memory, the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their LCM and GCD. This can be really useful here: \\( \\text{LCM}(a, b) \\times \\text{GCD}(a, b) = a \\times b \\).\n- Let me verify if this information really helps. Our task is straightforward if we can calculate this way, but if not, I'll need to calculate both LCM and GCD separately.\n\n**Step 2: First, let's find the GCD of 22 and 48**\n- The GCD is found by looking at common factors. I\u2019ll list the prime factors:\n  - Prime factorization of 22: \\( 2 \\times 11 \\)\n  - Prime factorization of 48: \\( 2^4 \\times 3 \\)\n  \n- The common prime factor is 2. So, the GCD is 2.\n- Quick reflection: This makes sense as 2 is the largest number that divides both 22 and 48.\n\n**Step 3: Now, calculate the LCM of 22 and 48**\n- The LCM is found by taking the highest powers of all prime factors present in both numbers:\n  - For 2: Highest power is \\( 2^4 \\)\n  - For 11: It appears only in 22, so include \\( 11 \\)\n  - For 3: It appears only in 48, so include \\( 3 \\)\n\n- Calculating the LCM: \\( \\text{LCM} = 2^4 \\times 11 \\times 3 \\)\n- Do the math: \n  - \\( 2^4 = 16 \\)\n  - \\( 16 \\times 11 = 176 \\)\n  - \\( 176 \\times 3 = 528 \\)\n\n- Quick check: Does this feel right? Multiplying it seems likely as we are combining all factors into one number.\n\n**Step 4: Use the relationship or multiply LCM by GCD**\n- Since we've calculated both LCM and GCD, let's multiply them together:\n  - \\( \\text{Product} = \\text{LCM} \\times \\text{GCD} = 528 \\times 2 \\)\n  - Do the multiplication: \\( 528 \\times 2 = 1056 \\)\n\n**Step 5: Reflection and Final Thoughts**\n- This seems consistent with the product of 22 and 48, as summed by the relationship \\( 22 \\times 48 = \\text{LCM} \\times \\text{GCD} \\).\n- Quick check of math: \n  - Multiplying original numbers: \\( 22 \\times 48 = 1056 \\)\n  - Our previous calculation matches, confirming our steps and logic was aligned.\n\nIn conclusion, the product of the least common multiple and the greatest common factor of 22 and 48 is 1056.",

  "ground_truth": "Writing out the prime factors of $22$ and $48$, we see that $22 = 2 \\cdot 11$ and $48 = 16 \\cdot 3 = 2^4 \\cdot 3$. Since $11$ does not divide $48$ and $3$ does not divide $22$, it follows that the greatest common factor of $22$ and $48$ is $2$.\n\nThe least common multiple, on the other hand, must account for the prime factors of both $22$ and $48$. The highest power of $2$ present in either term is $2^4 = 16$, of $3$ is $3^1 = 3$, and of $11$ is $11^1 = 11$. Thus, the LCM will be $2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11 = 528$. The product of the greatest common factor and the least common multiple is thus $2 \\cdot 528 = \\boxed{1056}$."
