    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think it through step by step. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst, let's restate what's given in the problem: We have two chords, \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\), meeting at a point \\(P\\) inside a circle. We know that \\(AP = CP = 7\\). We're asked to find the ratio \\(\\frac{BP}{DP}\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Strategies\n1. **Symmetry**: Given \\(AP = CP\\), there's a symmetry in the initial part of the configuration. This makes me think about some property involving equal segments, like congruence or similarity, though it's not exactly symmetrical since we need to consider entire chords.\n\n2. **Chord Intersection Theorem**: This situation seems familiar. If I recall correctly, the power of a point theorem (or chord intersection theorem) might apply here. If two chords intersect, the segments of each chord multiply to give the same product. Here, that would mean:\n   \\[\n   AP \\cdot PB = CP \\cdot PD\n   \\]\n   Since \\(AP = CP = 7\\), this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   7 \\cdot PB = 7 \\cdot PD\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cancelation**: From the equation above, dividing both sides by \\(7\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   PB = PD\n   \\]\n   This indicates that \\(BP = DP\\). So the ratio \\(\\frac{BP}{DP} = 1\\).\n\n### Checking and Re-evaluation\n- **Verification via Symmetry**: Given \\(AP = CP\\), our initial conditions already set \\(P\\) uniquely inside the circle in a symmetric manner relative to the arcs subdivided by \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\). So when \\(PB = PD\\), it makes sense geometrically as they maintain equal spacing from the equilibrium derived by the point \\(P\\).\n\n- **Revisiting Alternative Approaches**: Initially, I thought about geometrical transformations or reinforcement via trigonometric properties, but since the chord theorem gives us such a straightforward implication, an alternative doesn't seem necessary here.\n\n- **General Check**: As a quick check, suppose \\(AP = CP = 7\\) and \\(BP\\) and \\(DP\\) almost naturally force the triangle pairs (in terms of length balances) to coexist compatibly as \\(PB = PD\\), further confirming the automatic set by symmetry.\n\n### Reflection and Conclusion\n- Overall, the chord intersection theorem provided a concise solution, and symmetry helped verify the intuitive balance.\n- There's confidence in the algebraic rearrangement and geometric reasoning behind setting \\(BP = DP\\), making the ratio \\(\\frac{BP}{DP} = 1\\) the solution.\n  \nThe answer to the problem is:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\nAfter reviewing the entire solution process, I feel confident that the solution approach and checks are solid.",
