    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We have the polynomial \\( ax^3 + bx - c \\) that is divisible by \\( x^2 + bx + c \\). This means that when \\( ax^3 + bx - c \\) is divided by \\( x^2 + bx + c \\), the remainder is zero. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nLet's break it down first. \n\nWhen one polynomial divides another, the division can be expressed as:\n\\[ ax^3 + bx - c = (x^2 + bx + c)(Q(x)) + R(x) \\]\nwhere \\( Q(x) \\) is the quotient and \\( R(x) \\) is the remainder.\n\nSince \\( x^2 + bx + c \\) is a quadratic polynomial, the remainder \\( R(x) \\) must be a polynomial of degree less than 2. For \\( x^2 + bx + c \\) to be a factor, the remainder \\( R(x) \\) needs to be zero. So all terms of up to degree 1 in \\( ax^3 + bx - c \\) can be derived from the division process between these polynomials.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Form of the Quotient\nSince our divisor is a quadratic polynomial, the quotient \\( Q(x) \\) must be a linear polynomial:\n\\[ Q(x) = dx + e \\]\nThis is because when you multiply \\( (x^2 + bx + c) \\) by a linear polynomial \\( (dx + e) \\), the highest degree term will be cubic:\n\\[ (dx + e)(x^2 + bx + c) = dx^3 + (bd + e)x^2 + (cd + be)x + ce \\]\n\n### Step 3: Matching the Terms\nLet's try equating the terms of \\( ax^3 + bx - c = (dx^3 + (bd + e)x^2 + (cd + be)x + ce) \\).\n\n- For \\( x^3 \\), the coefficient is \\( a = d \\).\n- For \\( x^2 \\), remember that we have no \\( x^2 \\) term in the given polynomial, so:\n  \\[ bd + e = 0 \\]\n- For \\( x \\), the coefficient is \\( b = cd + be \\).\n- Constant term, \\(-c = ce\\).\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the Equations\n\n1. From \\( a = d \\), we have \\( d = a \\).\n2. From \\( bd + e = 0 \\), we substitute \\( d = a \\) to get:\n   \\[ ba + e = 0 \\]\n   \\[ e = -ba \\]\n\n3. From \\(-c = ce\\), substituting \\( e = -ba \\):\n   \\[ -c = c(-ba) \\]\n   \\[ -c = -cba \\]\n   \\[ c(1 - ba) = 0 \\]\n\nSince \\( c \\neq 0 \\), this implies \\( 1 - ba = 0 \\), hence \\( ba = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nFrom the final equation \\( ba = 1 \\), we find that \\( ab = 1 \\).\n\nLet's double-check this result by reviewing our substitution process and constraints. Everything checks out logically. The problem's conditions and constraints have been met without contradictions. The values satisfy the division requirement for zero remainder, confirming that the problem was approached correctly.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\( ab = 1 \\)\n\nIt's always especially rewarding when the problem steps lead logically and clearly to a solution, confirming the underlying mathematical structure.",

  "ground_truth": "If $ax^3 + bx - c$ has $x^2 + bx + c$ has a factor, then the other factor must be of the form $ax - 1,$ in order to make the leading and constant coefficients match.  Thus,\n\\[(x^2 + bx + c)(ax - 1) = ax^3 + bx - c.\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[ax^3 + (ab - 1) x^2 + (ac - b) x - c = ax^3 + bx - c.\\]Matching coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\nab - 1 &= 0, \\\\\nac - b &= b.\n\\end{align*}Hence, $ab = \\boxed{1}.$"
