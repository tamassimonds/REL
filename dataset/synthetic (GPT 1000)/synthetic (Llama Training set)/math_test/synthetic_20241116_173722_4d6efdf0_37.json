I'm going to lay out my initial thoughts, potential strategies, and my step-by-step reasoning as I work through it.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nThis problem involves finding quadratic equations such that whenever \\( c \\) is a root, \\( c^2 - 2 \\) is also a root. This reminds me of how solutions to quadratics are related by their sum and product. It seems like a problem involving symmetric properties of roots. I'm thinking about using Vieta's formulas as they relate the sum and product of the roots to the coefficients of the quadratic.\n\n### Brainstorming\n- **Vieta's Formulas**: For a quadratic \\( x^2 + ax + b = 0 \\), if \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) are roots, then \\( r_1 + r_2 = -a \\) and \\( r_1r_2 = b \\).\n- Since both \\( c \\) and \\( c^2 - 2 \\) are roots, the equations for these roots should satisfy Vieta's formulas.\n  \n### Strategy 1: Use Known Relations\n1. Suppose \\( c \\) is a root. Then \\( c^2 - 2 \\) is another root.\n2. By Vieta's, \\( c + (c^2 - 2) = -a \\) and \\( c(c^2 - 2) = b \\).\n\n   Let's break this down:\n   - The sum condition becomes \\( c + c^2 - 2 = -a \\). Rearranging, \\( c^2 + c + a - 2 = 0 \\).\n   - The product condition becomes \\( c^3 - 2c = b \\).\n\n3. This gives us two equations involving \\( c \\), \\( a \\), and \\( b \\):\n   - \\( c^2 + c + a - 2 = 0 \\)\n   - \\( c^3 - 2c = b \\)\n\nWait, let me think if this approach will really help. Solving for \\( c \\) seems too complex because \\( c \\) is essentially arbitrary \u2014 it's not given to us directly, only its relationship as a root with \\( c^2 - 2 \\).\n\n### Strategy 2: Check Special Cases\nLet's consider specific simple cases to gain insight, perhaps where the values are more manageable:\n- **Case 1**: Consider \\( c = 0 \\). Then \\( c^2 - 2 = -2 \\). So we have a quadratic with roots \\( 0 \\) and \\(-2\\):\n  - This would give \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\) (from \\( x(x + 2) = x^2 + 2x\\)).\n\n- **Case 2**: Consider \\( c = 1 \\). Then \\( c^2 - 2 = -1 \\). The quadratic with roots \\( 1 \\) and \\( -1 \\) would be:\n  - From this, \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( b = -1 \\) (since the polynomial is \\( x^2 -1 \\)).\n\nOh, I think I see a pattern forming: we only need to check if these conditions naturally resolve into a consistent condition for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n### Strategy 3: Solve The Overall Condition\nReflect on what's been learnt from the special cases:\n- Vieta's gives us symmetry, so it makes sense to check pairs such that:\n  - Both root transformations (\\(c\\) and \\(c^2 - 2\\)) iterate correctly requiring the roots to close under this mapping transformation, which would point directly to symmetric cases like zero pairs, negative pairs matching. Each propose:\n  - Iterate for a few obvious solutions, because even seen generally, finding consistent quadratic solutions rather than endless roots is crucial.\n  \n- Check other natural symmetry conditions; and it might be a restricting condition for the quadratic to have roots that resolve much faster through simple relations.\n\n### Further Reflection\nInlining or chaining the equations without distinct relating factors seems to imply:\n- The condition \\( c^2 = 2 \\) reappears constantly. Specifically, the identity nature of roots suggests further feedback like flat repetition \\(c\\) itself appearing, hinting that \\(x^2 - ax + 1\\) (having roots \\( \\pm\\sqrt{2} \\) provides additional natural roots closure.\n\nAha, Given the simplicity, confirming, such quadratics must encapsulate these symmetries:\n\n### Conclusion\nThere's direct simplism around, restricted equations are singularly formed till overlaps appear. Simple quadratics render very restrictive valid cases:\n- Only a select number of cases like \\( x^2 \\pm ax + b = 0 \\), which allows us to draw continuity for closure: very rare such setups or sub-configurations qualifying as solutions exist.\n\nThis suggests a conclusion where such quadraticals as rep echoes of solutions handle further complexity or resolve rare configurations, iterating back should precisely fit directly derivable symmetries, rendering about 4 or fewer possible fixing configurations due simplistically hinted configurations around \\(\\pm\\) scenarios.\n\nAlright, let's continue with the problem and refine our approach based on our previous exploration. I initially tried to work with Vieta's formulas and specific cases, but something didn't quite add up. Let's re-evaluate and see where we missed the mark, then integrate the correct reasoning to find all valid quadratic equations.\n\n### Re-evaluation of Previous Approach\n\nReflecting on my initial strategies, I attempted to leverage Vieta's formulas and examine special cases, assuming specific values for the roots and checking their transformations. While this helped visualize potential solutions, I did not rigorously account for all possible root interactions under the transformation \\( c \\rightarrow c^2 - 2 \\).\n\nLet's revisit the problem by more systematically exploring the cases, ensuring all conditions are met for both roots.\n\n### Revised Strategy: Systematic Case Analysis\n\n#### Case 1: Repeated Roots\n\n- **Same Root \\( r = s \\):** \n  If \\( r = r^2 - 2 \\), solving yields \\( r^2 - r - 2 = 0 \\). Factoring gives \\( (r - 2)(r + 1) = 0 \\), so \\( r = 2 \\) or \\( r = -1 \\).\n  - With \\( r = 2 \\), the quadratic is \\((x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4\\).\n  - With \\( r = -1 \\), the quadratic is \\((x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1\\).\n\n#### Case 2: Distinct Roots \\( r \\neq s \\)\n\nA more detailed examination of distinct root cases:\n\n- Sub-case (i): \\( r^2 - 2 = r \\) and \\( s^2 - 2 = s \\).\n  - We already solved these, leading to \\( r, s \\in \\{2, -1\\} \\), resulting in the quadratic \\((x - 2)(x + 1) = x^2 - x - 2\\).\n  \n- Sub-case (ii): \\( r^2 - 2 = s \\) and \\( s^2 - 2 = r \\).\n  - Subtracting and solving these, we derive \\( r + s = -1 \\) and \\( rs = -1 \\). Thus, the quadratic is \\( x^2 + x - 1 \\).\n\n- Sub-case (iii): \\( r^2 - 2 = s^2 - 2 = r \\).\n  - Solving \\( r^2 - r - 2 = 0 \\) gives \\( r = 2 \\) or \\( r = -1 \\).\n  - If \\( r = 2 \\), solving \\( s^2 = 4 \\) gives \\( s = -2 \\) (since \\( r \\neq s \\)), leading to \\((x - 2)(x + 2) = x^2 - 4\\).\n  - If \\( r = -1 \\), solving \\( s^2 = 1 \\) gives \\( s = 1 \\), leading to \\((x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 - 1\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy systematically examining each potential case for both repeated and distinct roots, we determine that the valid quadratics that satisfy the problem's conditions are:\n\n1. \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 + 2x + 1 \\)\n3. \\( x^2 - x - 2 \\)\n4. \\( x^2 + x - 1 \\)\n5. \\( x^2 - 4 \\)\n6. \\( x^2 - 1 \\)\n\nThus, there are indeed \\(\\boxed{6}\\) quadratic equations that meet the criteria. This comprehensive analysis assures that all valid configurations have been considered.",
