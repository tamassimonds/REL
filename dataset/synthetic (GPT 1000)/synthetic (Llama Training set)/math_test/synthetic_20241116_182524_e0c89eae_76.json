    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The question involves an unfair coin with different probabilities for heads, tails, and landing on its edge. We need to calculate the expected winnings from a single flip. \n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- At first glance, this looks like a typical expected value problem, which I remember from probability courses. I know I\u2019ll likely need to multiply each outcome's winnings by its probability and sum these products.\n- Hmm, the probabilities don\u2019t seem standard. Usually, coins have heads and tails, but the edge is an unusual addition. I\u2019ll need to keep this in mind while calculating.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Variables and Data\n\n**Let's identify what we have:**\n- Probability of heads, \\( P(H) = \\frac{3}{5} \\)\n- Probability of tails, \\( P(T) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n- Probability of edge, \\( P(E) = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n\n**Corresponding Winnings:**\n- Heads: Win $4\n- Tails: Lose $1\n- Edge: Lose $10\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- This structure requires looking closely at both winnings and losses. \n- Even though the edge seems unlikely, I must consider its impact as a loss.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Expected Value\n\nThe expected value (\\(E\\)) can be found using the formula:\n\\[ E = \\sum (\\text{Probability of outcome} \\times \\text{Winnings for outcome}) \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **Heads:** \n   - Probability \\( = \\frac{3}{5} \\)\n   - Winnings \\( = +4 \\text{ dollars} \\)\n   - Contribution to \\(E\\): \\(\\frac{3}{5} \\times 4 = \\frac{12}{5} = 2.4\\)\n\n2. **Tails:**\n   - Probability \\( = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n   - Winnings \\( = -1 \\text{ dollar} \\)\n   - Contribution to \\(E\\): \\(\\frac{1}{5} \\times (-1) = -\\frac{1}{5} = -0.2\\)\n\n3. **Edge:**\n   - Probability \\( = \\frac{1}{5} \\)\n   - Winnings \\( = -10 \\text{ dollars} \\)\n   - Contribution to \\(E\\): \\(\\frac{1}{5} \\times (-10) = -\\frac{10}{5} = -2\\)\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- These contributions seem to align with regular expected value calculations.\n- Now, I\u2019ll sum these to get the total expected value for the coin flip.\n\n### Step 4: Sum up the Expected Values\n\n\\[ E = 2.4 + (-0.2) + (-2) \\]\n\n\\[ E = 2.4 - 0.2 - 2 \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n- \\(2.4 - 0.2 = 2.2\\)\n- \\(2.2 - 2 = 0.2\\)\n\n**Final Result:**\n- The expected winnings from one flip are $0.2\n\n### Reflection and Checks:\n\n- Hmm, after reflection, \\(0.2\\) seems plausible because the high chance of winning $4 outweighs the rarer but steeper loss of $10.\n- Checked each step for arithmetic mistakes\u2014everything adds up.\n- Consider ways to double-check:\n  - Perhaps running a simulation could provide confidence, but theoretically, these calculations should be sound.\n- Actually, maybe there\u2019s an easier conceptual check: With a high chance of favorable outcomes and only rare costly downfalls, small net positive seems reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The expected winnings from one flip, rounding to the nearest cent, is \\(\\$0.20\\).",
