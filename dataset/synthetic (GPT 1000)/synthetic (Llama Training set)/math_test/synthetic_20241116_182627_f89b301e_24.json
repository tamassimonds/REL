    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem by going through my thoughts and calculations step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\n**Initial Thought**: \"I'm given an equation involving fractions: \\(\\frac{1\\frac{1}{6}}{w} = \\frac{42}{3}\\). I think I should start by simplifying these fractions, as fractional equations often become more manageable when fully simplified.\"\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Fractions\n\n**Simplifying Fraction on the Right**:  \n- \\(\\frac{42}{3}\\) simplifies directly because 42 divided by 3 is 14.\n- So, \\(\\frac{42}{3} = 14\\).\n\n**Check**: \"Yeah, 42 divided by 3 is definitely 14, so I\u2019m confident this part is correct.\"\n\n**Simplifying Mixed Fraction on the Left**:  \n- \\(1\\frac{1}{6}\\) is a mixed number.\n- I need to convert it into an improper fraction for easier manipulation.\n- \\(1\\frac{1}{6} = 1 + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{7}{6}\\).\n\n**Reflection**:  \n\"Mixed numbers are always converted to improper fractions by multiplying the whole number part by the denominator and adding the numerator. \\(1 \\cdot 6 + 1 = 7\\). Okay, that seems correct!\"\n\n### Step 3: Write the Equation Again with Simplified Fractions\n\nNow that I have the fractions simplified:\n- The equation becomes: \\(\\frac{\\frac{7}{6}}{w} = 14\\).\n\n### Step 4: Rearrange the Equation to Solve for \\(w\\)\n\n**Thought**: \"I need to get \\(w\\) by itself. The equation is \\(\\frac{\\frac{7}{6}}{w} = 14\\). It might be easier to think about the fraction division involving \\(w\\).\"\n\n**Equation Manipulation**:\n- \\(\\frac{\\frac{7}{6}}{w} = 14\\) can be understood as \\(\\frac{7}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{w} = 14\\).\n- To isolate \\(\\frac{1}{w}\\), I can multiply both sides by \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\).\n- \\(\\frac{1}{w} = 14 \\cdot \\frac{6}{7}\\).\n\n**Calculate \\(14 \\cdot \\frac{6}{7}\\)**:\n- \\(14\\) is the same as \\(\\frac{14}{1}\\).\n- So, \\(\\frac{14}{1} \\cdot \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{14 \\cdot 6}{7}\\).\n\n**Finding the Product**:\n- \\(14 \\cdot 6 = 84\\).\n- \\(\\frac{84}{7} = 12\\).\n\n**Check**: \"Dividing 84 by 7 gives me 12. That feels right because 84 divided by 7 is 12. Double-checked it, seems correct.\"\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\(w\\)\n\nNow \\(\\frac{1}{w} = 12\\) tells us:\n- To find \\(w\\), take the reciprocal of 12.\n- So, \\(w = \\frac{1}{12}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Reflect and Verify\n\n**Final Check**:\n- Substitute \\(w = \\frac{1}{12}\\) back into the original setup to verify:\n  \\(\\frac{\\frac{7}{6}}{\\frac{1}{12}} = \\frac{7}{6} \\cdot 12 = \\frac{84}{6} = 14\\).\n- The left side equals the simplified right side (14), confirming that \\(w = \\frac{1}{12}\\) is correct.\n\n**Conclusion**: \n\"I\u2019ve verified my solution at different steps, and all checks led to consistency. \\(w = \\frac{1}{12}\\) seems to be spot on!\"",

  "ground_truth": "Simplifying the left side gives \\[\\frac{1\\frac16}{w} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{6}}{w} = \\frac{7}{6}\\cdot\\frac1w = \\frac{7}{6w},\\] so the equation is \\[\\frac{7}{6w} = \\frac{42}{3} = 14.\\] Multiplying both sides by $6w$ gives $7=14(6w)$.  Dividing both sides by 7 gives $1=2(6w)$, and dividing both sides by 12 gives $w = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$."
