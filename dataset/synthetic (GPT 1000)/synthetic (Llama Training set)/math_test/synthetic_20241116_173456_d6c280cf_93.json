    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We need to find the integer \\( n \\) such that \\( -90 < n < 90 \\) and \\(\\tan n^\\circ = \\tan 252^\\circ\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\nThis seems like a problem that involves understanding the behavior and properties of the tangent function. I know the tangent function has some periodic properties; specifically, it repeats every 180 degrees. This could be useful, as it might allow me to connect \\( \\tan 252^\\circ \\) to an angle within the range we want for \\( n \\).\n\n### Strategy Brainstorm:\n1. **Angle Reduction using Periodicity of Tangent:** Since \\(\\tan \\theta\\) is periodic with period 180 degrees, \\(\\tan(\\theta) = \\tan(\\theta + 180^\\circ k)\\) for any integer \\( k \\). We could utilize this to find an equivalent angle to 252 degrees that's within the range \\(-90 < n < 90\\).\n\n2. **Use Reference Angles:** Sometimes finding the reference angle helps to understand where the original angle lies in the unit circle and thus helps to reduce to the desired range.\n\n3. **Unit Circle Analysis:** Visualizing where 252 degrees lies on the unit circle could help. Since 252 is clearly larger than 180, it's in the third quadrant where the tangent is positive.\n\n### Exploring Option 1: Periodicity\nLet's see if we can use periodicity first.\n\n1. We know \\(\\tan\\) repeats every 180 degrees. Thus, we can subtract 180 degrees from 252 to bring it closer to zero because:\n\n   \\[\n   252^\\circ - 180^\\circ = 72^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n2. Now, we check if 72 degrees is within the range \\(-90, 90\\), which it is. This is a good sign because it directly fits within the said constraint.\n\n### Checking:\nGiven our step, \\( n = 72 \\) satisfies \\(\\tan n^\\circ = \\tan 252^\\circ\\), as both are equivalent angles within their periodic framework.\n\n- Quick tangent check: Using a calculator or looking at unit circle properties, \\(\\tan 252^\\circ\\) and \\(\\tan 72^\\circ\\) should indeed have the same value since \\(\\tan\\) is positive in both 1st and 3rd quadrants.\n\n### Aha Moment!\nOur approach seems correct because through angle reduction using periodicity, we aligned the angle with a corresponding one in the specified range. The tangent function's periodic property worked directly, providing a straightforward solution.\n\n### Final Reflection:\nDouble-checking confirms \\( n = 72 \\) is indeed the answer since it was calculated by the periodicity of the tangent, preserving the condition \\(-90 < n < 90\\).\n\nIn conclusion, the integer \\( n \\) that satisfies \\(\\tan n^\\circ = \\tan 252^\\circ\\) within the constraints given is \\( n = 72 \\).",
