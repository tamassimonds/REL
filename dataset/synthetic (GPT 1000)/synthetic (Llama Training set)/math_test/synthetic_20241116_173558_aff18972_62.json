    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see where it leads us.\n\nFirst Thoughts: \n\nOkay, this problem involves a cube root equation, \\(\\sqrt[3]{4x^2} = 4\\). My first instinct is, \"Hmm, cube roots... I think I've encountered these before, and if I want to solve them, I probably need to eliminate that root first. That usually involves raising both sides of the equation to the power of three.\"\n\nAnother thought is, \"Since we are dealing with cube roots, and we're thinking about raising to powers, this might not be too bad once we manage that cube root.\"\n\nGreat, so let me try to start by eliminating that cube root.\n\n1. **Eliminate the Cube Root:**\n\n   The equation is \\(\\sqrt[3]{4x^2} = 4\\).\n\n   To eliminate the cube root, I need to cube both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt[3]{4x^2})^3 = 4^3\n   \\]\n\n   On the left side, the cube of the cube root cancels out, leaving us with:\n\n   \\[\n   4x^2 = 64\n   \\]\n\n   Alright, those steps seem solid. Let's move on and solve for \\(x\\).\n\n2. **Solve for \\(x^2\\):**\n\n   Now, I have the equation \\(4x^2 = 64\\).\n\n   To isolate \\(x^2\\), I'll divide both sides by 4:\n\n   \\[\n   x^2 = \\frac{64}{4} = 16\n   \\]\n\n   Good, this seems to be working. Now, I just need to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n\n   Since \\(x^2 = 16\\), I need to take the square root of both sides. But wait, this is crucial: remember to consider both positive and negative roots because squaring either will give 16. \n\n   \\[\n   x = \\pm \\sqrt{16}\n   \\]\n\n   This gives me:\n\n   \\[\n   x = 4 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -4\n   \\]\n\n   Nice, it's coming together. But let me check quickly if my solutions fit the original problem.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n\n   Plugging in \\(x = 4\\) into the original equation:\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{4(4)^2} = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4\n   \\]\n\n   That works perfectly.\n\n   Now, try \\(x = -4\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{4(-4)^2} = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4\n   \\]\n\n   That also checks out nicely.\n\n5. **List Values:**\n\n   My solution values are \\(x = -4\\) and \\(x = 4\\).\n\n   From least to greatest, the solutions are:\n\n   \\[\n   x = -4, \\quad x = 4\n   \\]\n\nI've double-checked the logic and calculations along the way, and each choice seems valid with the original equation. Everything checks out, so these are the solutions in the desired order.",

  "ground_truth": "In order to get rid of the cube root, we start by cubing the both sides of the equation \\begin{align*} (\\sqrt[3]{4x^2})^3&=(4)^3\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 4x^2& =64\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x^2& =16\n\\end{align*}From here, we can see that the only possible values of $x$ are 4 and -4. Since the question asked to list them from least to greatest, the final answer is $\\boxed{-4, 4}$."
