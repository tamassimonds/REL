    "working_out": "Alright, let's start by understanding the problem: We need to find the multiplicative inverse of 17 modulo 83. This means we are looking for an integer \\( x \\) such that:\n\n\\[ 17x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{83} \\]\n\nThe problem hints at \\( 17 \\times 5 = 85 \\). Immediately, we can recognize that 85 is 2 more than 83, and thus, \\( 85 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{83} \\). However, this hint alone doesn't solve the problem for us, but it\u2019s good to note that this could be useful later.\n\nThe simplest way to find the multiplicative inverse is to use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This method is rooted in the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor.\n\n### Step 1: Use the Euclidean Algorithm\nLet's find the GCD of 17 and 83 using the Euclidean algorithm to assure ourselves that they are coprime, which is necessary for the existence of an inverse.\n\n1. \\( 83 \\div 17 = 4 \\) remainder \\( 15 \\) so \\( 83 = 17 \\times 4 + 15 \\).\n2. \\( 17 \\div 15 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 2 \\) so \\( 17 = 15 \\times 1 + 2 \\).\n3. \\( 15 \\div 2 = 7 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\) so \\( 15 = 2 \\times 7 + 1 \\).\n4. \\( 2 \\div 1 = 2 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\) so \\( 2 = 1 \\times 2 + 0 \\).\n\nSince the last non-zero remainder is 1, GCD(17, 83) is 1, confirming they are coprime. Thus, the inverse exists.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm\nNow we'll work backwards using these steps to express 1 as a linear combination of 17 and 83.\n\n1. From step 3: \\( 1 = 15 - 2 \\times 7 \\).\n2. From step 2: Substitute for 2, \\( 2 = 17 - 15 \\).\n   \\[\n   1 = 15 - (17 - 15) \\times 7 = 15 - 7 \\times 17 + 7 \\times 15 = 8 \\times 15 - 7 \\times 17\n   \\]\n3. From step 1: Substitute for 15, \\( 15 = 83 - 17 \\times 4 \\).\n   \\[\n   1 = 8 \\times (83 - 17 \\times 4) - 7 \\times 17 = 8 \\times 83 - 32 \\times 17 - 7 \\times 17\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 = 8 \\times 83 - 39 \\times 17\n   \\]\n\nWe now have \\( 1 = 8 \\times 83 - 39 \\times 17 \\), which implies:\n\n\\[ -39 \\times 17 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{83} \\]\n\nThus, the inverse of 17 modulo 83 is \\(-39\\).\n\n### Step 3: Convert to a Positive Residue\nThe work isn't quite done because we need the result to be a residue from \\( 0 \\) to \\( 82 \\). To convert \\(-39\\) to a positive equivalent under modulo 83, we can add 83:\n\n\\[ -39 + 83 = 44 \\]\n\nThus, the multiplicative inverse of 17 modulo 83 is \\( 44 \\).\n\n### Verification:\nLet's verify:\n\\[ 17 \\times 44 = 748 \\]\nNow, compute \\( 748 \\mod 83 \\):\n\\[ 748 \\div 83 \\approx 9.012 \\] which gives the integer part as 9.\n\\[ 748 - 83 \\times 9 = 748 - 747 = 1 \\]\n\nSince \\( 17 \\times 44 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{83} \\), the solution is verified.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe multiplicative inverse of 17 modulo 83 is \\( \\boxed{44} \\). This makes sense given our calculations and reflection at each step verifying back to the problem definition.",
