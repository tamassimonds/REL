    "working_out": "Alright, let's approach this problem by brainstorming and exploring different strategies.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nThe problem gives the roots of the quadratic equation \\( 4x^2 + 7x + k = 0 \\) as \\( \\frac{-7 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}}{8} \\). This looks similar to a case where the roots are complex conjugates, which often happens when using the quadratic formula.\n\nFirst, let's recall that if the roots of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) are \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\), the relationship between the coefficients and the roots are:\n\n1. Sum of the roots: \\( \\alpha + \\beta = -\\frac{b}{a} \\)\n2. Product of the roots: \\( \\alpha \\beta = \\frac{c}{a} \\)\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n#### Strategy 1: Use the Given Roots Directly\n\nGiven roots are \\( \\frac{-7 + i\\sqrt{15}}{8} \\) and \\( \\frac{-7 - i\\sqrt{15}}{8} \\).\n\nSince they are complex conjugates, their imaginary parts should cancel each other when summed, and their product should give us \\( \\frac{k}{4} \\).\n\n#### Strategy 2: Derive from Sum and Product of Roots\n\n- Find the sum: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Sum of roots} = \\left(\\frac{-7 + i\\sqrt{15}}{8}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{-7 - i\\sqrt{15}}{8}\\right)\n  \\]\n  Simplifying, we get:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{-7 - 7}{8} = \\frac{-14}{8} = -\\frac{7}{4}\n  \\]\n  This matches with \\(-\\frac{b}{a} = -\\frac{7}{4}\\) given by the quadratic \\(4x^2 + 7x + k\\).\n\n- Find the product:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Product of roots} = \\left(\\frac{-7 + i\\sqrt{15}}{8}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{-7 - i\\sqrt{15}}{8}\\right)\n  \\]\n  Using the identity \\( (a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2 \\) with \\( a = \\frac{-7}{8} \\) and \\( b = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{8} \\),\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{-7}{8}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{49}{64} + \\frac{15}{64} = \\frac{64}{64} = 1\n  \\]\n  So, the product \\( \\frac{k}{4} = 1 \\) implying \\( k = 4 \\).\n\n### Reflecting on the Approach\n\nThe strategy of sum and product of roots aligns well because our calculations show that:\n\n- The sum of the roots corresponds to \\(-\\frac{7}{4}\\), which matches the structure of the quadratic formula \\(-\\frac{b}{a}\\).\n\n- The product of the roots yields 1, meaning when scaled by 4 (the coefficient of \\(x^2\\)), \\(k = 4\\).\n\nThis outcome is consistent with known theories, so our answer \\( k = 4 \\) makes sense. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nWith careful calculations and checks, we've reached a consistent conclusion. Therefore, the value of \\( k \\) is \\( 4 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Using the quadratic formula, we find that the roots of the quadratic are $\\frac{-7\\pm\\sqrt{7^2-4(4)(k)}}{8}=\\frac{-7\\pm\\sqrt{49-16k}}{8}$. Since the problem tells us that these roots must equal $\\frac{-7\\pm\\sqrt{15}i}{8}$, \\begin{align*} \\sqrt{49-16k}&=\\sqrt{15}i\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\sqrt{49-16k}&=\\sqrt{-15}\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 49-16k&=-15\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 16k&=64\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad k&=\\boxed{4}.\n\\end{align*}"
