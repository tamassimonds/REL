    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving the problem of finding for how many two-digit positive integers the product of the digits equals 12.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- We need to find two-digit numbers where the product of the digits equals 12.\n- A two-digit number can be represented by \\(10a + b\\) where \\(a\\) is the tens digit and \\(b\\) is the units digit.\n- This likely involves factoring 12 into pairs of numbers that fit our two-digit format (i.e., each factor is a single digit).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- The two-digit number condition tells us \\(a\\) can be from 1 to 9 and \\(b\\) can be from 0 to 9 (since \\(b\\) can be any digit).\n- Let's explore the factors of 12 to generate potential pairs:\n  - Factors of 12: \\((1, 12), (2, 6), (3, 4), (4, 3), (6, 2), (12, 1)\\)\n  - However, digits must be between 0 and 9, so discard pairs with numbers greater than 9.\n\n**Step-by-step Exploration:**\n\n1. **Identifying Valid Pairs:**\n   - Factor pairs within the 1-9 range: \\((2, 6), (3, 4), (4, 3), (6, 2)\\)\n\n2. **Checking if the Numbers are Two-digits:**\n   - Reverse roles of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) for each pair to verify they represent tens and units digits:\n   - For each pair, both \\((a, b)\\) and \\((b, a)\\) could potentially form valid numbers, as long as they are two digits.\n\n3. **Valid Number Formation:**\n   - \\((2, 6)\\): \n     - \\(26\\) is valid (where \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 6\\))\n     - \\(62\\) is valid (where \\(a = 6\\) and \\(b = 2\\))\n   - \\((3, 4)\\):\n     - \\(34\\) is valid (where \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\))\n     - \\(43\\) is valid (where \\(a = 4\\) and \\(b = 3\\))\n    \n4. **Re-check and Summary:**\n   - Re-evaluate each step to ensure I didn't miss any valid combinations:\n     - Rechecking factor pairs, sticking to \\(0-9\\) as valid digit range.\n     - Confirmed that all numbers I formed are within a two-digit range.\n   - There are no other factorization possibilities for digits that satisfy this problem.\n   \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The valid numbers are: 26, 62, 34, and 43.\n   - Therefore, there are **4 two-digit integers** where the product of the digits equals 12.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The approach seems sound, focusing on the factors and repositioning them into valid two-digit numbers.\n- Double-checked the arithmetic and factor pairs; everything aligns with the initial task requirement.\n- The solution feels comprehensive, covering all required checks and balances for accuracy.\n\nGreat! We've determined the correct number of two-digit integers for which the digit product equals 12, and the solution falls perfectly within the expected constraints of such a problem.",
