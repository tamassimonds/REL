    "working_out": "Okay, let's tackle this problem by exploring various strategies and letting my thoughts flow naturally. I'll keep in mind that we're dealing with a mix of regular and super packs of batteries, with the aim of determining how many regular packs were sent.\n\n---\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\n- We have two types of packs: regular packs (4 batteries each) and super packs (6 batteries each).\n- We know the total number of delivered packs is 32, and the total number of batteries is 166.\n\nHmm, this looks like it involves a system of equations. Let's see...\n\n---\n\n**Brainstorming Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Equation Setup:**\n   - Let\u2019s use variables: \n     - Let \\( x \\) be the number of regular packs.\n     - Let \\( y \\) be the number of super packs.\n   - We have two equations:\n     1. \\( x + y = 32 \\) (total packs)\n     2. \\( 4x + 6y = 166 \\) (total batteries)\n\n2. **Substitution or Elimination Method?**\n   - Both methods can work here. Let's consider substitution:\n     - From the first equation, \\( y = 32 - x \\)\n     - Substitute \\( y \\) in the second equation: \\( 4x + 6(32 - x) = 166 \\)\n\n3. **Simplify and Solve:**\n   - Distribute \\( 6 \\) into \\( (32 - x) \\): \n     \\( 4x + 192 - 6x = 166 \\)\n\n4. **Combine Like Terms:**\n   - Rearrange it to: \\( -2x + 192 = 166 \\)\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Subtract 192 from both sides: \\( -2x = 166 - 192 \\)\n   - Simplify: \\( -2x = -26 \\)\n   - Divide by \\(-2\\): \\( x = 13 \\)\n\n---\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- \\( x = 13 \\) (regular packs)\n- Using the first equation: \\( y = 32 - 13 = 19 \\) (super packs)\n\nLet's verify with the second condition:\n- Total batteries: \\( 4(13) + 6(19) = 52 + 114 = 166 \\)\n\nThis matches the given total of 166 batteries. Looks correct!\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The substitution method worked well here. At the start, I hoped for an efficient resolution, and indeed, breaking it down into equations made the steps straightforward.\n- It's crucial to check answers in real-world problems since small mistakes can often lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\nIn conclusion, the number of regular packs sent is \\( \\boxed{13} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Call the number of regular packs $r$ and the number of super packs $s$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given:  \\begin{align*}\nr + s &= 32 \\\\\n4r + 6s &= 166 \\\\\n\\end{align*} Multiplying the first equation by six and subtracting the second equation from that yields $(6r - 4r) + (6s - 6s) = (192 - 166)$. Solving for $r$ gives $2r = 26$, or $r = 13$. Thus, $\\boxed{13}$ regular packs were sent."
