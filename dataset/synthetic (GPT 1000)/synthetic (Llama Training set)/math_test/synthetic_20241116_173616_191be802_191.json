    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nFirst glance at the problem and I see it involves probabilities and combinations. This reminds me a bit of those \"binomial\" ones where we used combinations of things. Okay, so we have Pat choosing 8 pieces of fruit and we need the probability of either exactly 3 oranges or exactly 6 apples. I\u2019m imagining he\u2019s got a sack with oranges, apples, and bananas and he just keeps picking them randomly. But I\u2019m not sure how to count this yet...\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Probability of exactly 3 oranges:** Immediately I'm thinking: \"Okay, I can use the binomial probability formula here.\" Hmm, but let\u2019s not jump into formulas yet. What are the possible combinations here? Each fruit choice is independent and can be either an orange (O), apple (A), or banana (B). I\u2019ve done something like this with dice before \u2013 types of things where there\u2019s multiple outcomes per trial\u2026\n\n2. **Probability of exactly 6 apples:** Again, we\u2019re looking at combinations. Ah, and these might be two separate probabilities that we need to find and then combine somehow\u2026\n\n3. **Joint Probability? No Overlap Initially:**\n   These seem mutually exclusive situations (either exactly 3 oranges OR exactly 6 apples), not overlapping. So maybe I find each and then add probabilities.\n\n4. **Total Possible Outcomes:** \n   Right. There are \\(3^8\\) because for each piece of fruit, there are 3 options. Quick mental multiplication gets me thinking\u2026 \\(3^8 = 6561\\) total possible selections of fruits.\n\n**Step 1: Probability of Exactly 3 Oranges**\n\n- **Choosing the oranges:** Let\u2019s use combinations. There are \\(8\\) slots and I want to choose \\(3\\) of them for oranges. That's \\(\\binom{8}{3}\\).\n\n- **Non-orange fruits in other slots:** For the remaining \\(5\\) pieces of fruit, each slot is filled by either an apple or a banana. Okay, so that\u2019s \\(2^5\\) combinations since two choices for each remaining slot.\n\n- Evaluate:\n  \\[\n  \\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  2^5 = 32\n  \\]\n\n- Calculate the probability:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Probability of exactly 3 oranges} = \\frac{56 \\times 32}{6561}\n  \\]\n\n- Let me multiply those to be sure:\n  \\[\n  56 \\times 32 = 1792\n  \\]\n\n- So, \\(\\frac{1792}{6561}\\).\n\n**Step 2: Probability of Exactly 6 Apples**\n\n- **Choosing the apples:** Think similarly, \\(\\binom{8}{6}\\) would do.\n\n- **Non-apple fruits:** Down to \\(2^2\\) (because we fill 2 remaining slots with either orange or banana).\n\n- Evaluate:\n  \\[\n  \\binom{8}{6} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  2^2 = 4\n  \\]\n\n- Calculate the probability:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Probability of exactly 6 apples} = \\frac{28 \\times 4}{6561}\n  \\]\n\n- Let me work that out:\n  \\[\n  28 \\times 4 = 112\n  \\]\n\n- So, \\(\\frac{112}{6561}\\).\n\n**Step 3: Total Probability**\n\nThese are mutually exclusive since you cannot have exactly 3 oranges and 6 apples simultaneously when only 8 are chosen.\n\n- Total probability = Probability of 3 oranges + Probability of 6 apples:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1792}{6561} + \\frac{112}{6561} \n  \\]\n\n- Combine:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1792 + 112}{6561} = \\frac{1904}{6561}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI think this makes sense. I went through each portion and used combinations to handle the different ways to arrange the fruits. Then used the binomial-like model for filling non-target slots. It feels like a correct approach, and I corrected parts along the way. The process gels with how these types expand into every choice being explored. So, \\(\\frac{1904}{6561}\\) seems correct for this one.\n\nNow, I ensure that each step carried forward logically to reach this final probability. This was quite comprehensive, and I checked past each observation to be sure of the method and its application.\n\nConclusion: The probability that either exactly 3 pieces of the fruit are oranges or exactly 6 pieces are apples is \\(\\frac{1904}{6561}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "It is impossible for Pat to select both 3 oranges and 6 apples, so we can calculate the probabilities of these mutually exclusive cases separately and then add to get our final answer. The probability that 3 particular pieces of fruit will be oranges and the rest will not be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^5=\\dfrac{32}{6561}$, and there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways of selecting three pieces of fruit to be the oranges so the probability that 3 will be oranges is $56\\cdot\\dfrac{32}{6561}=\\dfrac{1792}{6561}$. Similarly, the probability that 6 particular pieces of fruit will be apples and the other two won't be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^6\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{6561}$ and there are $\\binom{8}{6}=28$ ways of selecting which ones will be the apples, so multiplying again gives us a probability of $28\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{6561}=\\dfrac{112}{6561}$. Adding those two probabilities give us our final answer: $\\dfrac{1792}{6561}+\\dfrac{112}{6561}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1904}{6561}}$."
