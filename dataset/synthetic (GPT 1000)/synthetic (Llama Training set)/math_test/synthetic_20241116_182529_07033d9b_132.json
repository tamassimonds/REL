    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with a brainstorm:\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- The question asks for the greatest number of distinct positive integer factors for any integer less than 20. \n- Initially, I'm thinking about what factors are. For example, if I pick different numbers randomly, how do the factors play out?\n- There's something nagging at the back of my mind that makes me want to consider prime numbers and products of small primes.\n\nInitial Strategy:\n- I'm thinking maybe I should list the numbers from 1 to 19 and count the factors for each. But is there a smarter way? This feels a bit too brute-force.\n\n- Maybe, I could target numbers that are products of smaller numbers since they might have more factors by combining others.\n- Another thought is that numbers with more divisors are often quite composite (a product of more than two numbers).\n\nTrying a concrete approach:\n- Let\u2019s go through the list step-by-step and try counting the factors for a few starting numbers:\n\n1: \\(1\\)\n   - Only has 1 factor (itself).\n\n2: \\(2\\)\n   - Factors are \\(1\\) and \\(2\\), so \\(2\\) factors total.\n\n3: \\(3\\)\n   - Factors are \\(1\\) and \\(3\\), so \\(2\\) factors total.\n\n4: \\(4\\)\n   - Factors are \\(1, 2, 4\\). That's \\(3\\) factors.\n\n5: \\(5\\)\n   - Factors are \\(1\\) and \\(5\\), so back to \\(2\\) factors.\n\nReflecting on these steps:\n- Okay, clearly, the more prime factors a number has, the more divisors it could potentially have. \n\nRenewed Strategy Based on Insight:\n- Let's start focusing on numbers that are products of multiple primes: see if these lead to more factors, maybe something like \\(12\\) or \\(18\\)?\n\nContinuing With This Strategy:\n  \n6: \\(6\\)\n   - Factors: \\(1, 2, 3, 6\\) - this has \\(4\\) factors.\n\n8: \\(8\\)\n   - Factors: \\(1, 2, 4, 8\\) - results in \\(4\\) factors.\n\n10: \\(10\\)\n   - Factors: \\(1, 2, 5, 10\\) = \\(4\\) factors.\n\n12: \\(12\\)\n   - Factors: \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\\) - now \\(6\\) factors! \n\nStopping here to Reflect:\n- Wow, \\(12\\) does have a fair amount due to its composition (being \\(2^2 \\times 3\\)), giving it an interesting divisor structure. Can we beat this?\n\nDigging Deeper for Confirmation:\n15: \\(15\\)\n   - Factors: \\(1, 3, 5, 15\\) - just \\(4\\) factors.\n\n16: \\(16\\)\n   - Factors: \\(1, 2, 4, 8, 16\\) - results in \\(5\\) factors. A solid attempt, but not enough.\n\n18: \\(18\\)\n   - Factors: \\(1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\\) \u2013 got \\(6\\) factors! Matches \\(12\\).\n\n19: \\(19\\)\n   - Factors: \\(1, 19\\) - simplest case, \\(2\\) factors due to being prime.\n\nA Final Reflective Check:\n- Both \\(12\\) and \\(18\\) ended with the largest count of \\(6\\) factors.\n- So, the answer is the greatest number of distinct positive integer factors for any positive integer less than 20 is **6 factors**.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating how composite numbers made by small primes contribute to this solution! Let's finalize our finding: The greatest number of distinct positive integer factors that a positive integer less than 20 can have is 6, demonstrated by numbers like 12 and 18.",

  "ground_truth": "An integer $n$ in the form $p^e$, for some prime $p$ and positive integer $e$, has $(e+1)$ positive factors. To maximize $e$, let $p=2$, the smallest prime. Since $n$ is less than 20, $e$ is at most 4, which means $n$ can have 5 factors. If $n$ is in the form $p_1^{e_1}\\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then let $p_1=2$ and $p_2=3$ to find the maximum possible $e_1$ and $e_2$. Both cannot be 2 (else $n=36$), so $e_1, e_2=1, 2$ give the most factors: $(2+1)(1+1)=\\boxed{6}$ factors. Finally, $n$ cannot be divisible by any other prime since $2\\cdot3\\cdot5=30>20$. Thus, the greatest number of distinct positive integer factors that a positive integer less than 20 can have is 6 factors. Of course, we could have solved this problem by finding the number of factors of each positive integer less than 20, but in general our approach is more efficient."
