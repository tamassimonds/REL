    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together. \n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe are asked to find the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of a segment with endpoints at \\((1,4)\\) and \\((1,10)\\). \n\nMy first thought is, \"Okay, we have two points, and we need to find the midpoint. This looks similar to the midpoint formula stuff I've seen before.\"\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\nLet\u2019s explore some strategies to solve this:\n\n1. **Use the Midpoint Formula:** The standard approach is to apply the midpoint formula, which is \\(\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\right)\\).\n   \n   - Hmmm, both \\(x\\) values are the same here (\\(x=1\\) for both). Does this simplify things? I'll have to calculate and see. \n\n2. **Geometric Understanding:** Hmm, looking at the points, both \\(x\\) coordinates are 1. This makes me think that the line segment is vertical. The midpoint should be somewhere between the \\(y\\) values, right? Let's use geometry intuition. \n\n3. **Visualization:** Sometimes drawing can help. Let's picture this on a rough sketch. We see a vertical line from (1, 4) to (1, 10).\n\nNow that I have some strategies, let's dive into one:\n\n**Applying the Midpoint Formula:**\n\n- Using the formula: \\(\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\right)\\).\n\n  - For \\(x\\)-coordinates: \\(x_1 = 1\\) and \\(x_2 = 1\\).\n  - For \\(y\\)-coordinates: \\(y_1 = 4\\) and \\(y_2 = 10\\).\n\n- Calculating the midpoint: \n\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{1+1}{2}, \\frac{4+10}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{2}, \\frac{14}{2}\\right) = \\left(1, 7\\right)\n  \\]\n\n\"That makes sense since both \\(x\\) values are the same, so the midpoint also has the same \\(x\\) value.\"\n\n**Calculating the Sum of Midpoint Coordinates:**\n\nFinally, the problem wants the sum of these coordinates:\n\n- So, sum the midpoint coordinates: \\(1 + 7\\).\n\n- Calculate: \n\n  \\[ \n  1 + 7 = 8 \n  \\]\n\n\"Okay, the math checks out here. Nothing seems out of place or overly large.\"\n\n**Reflecting and Verifying:**\n\n- Quick check: Since the points are vertically aligned, the midpoint should logically be directly between them vertically. My midpoint calculation, \\((1, 7)\\), looks right because \\(7\\) is halfway between \\(4\\) and \\(10\\).\n\n- Deep Reflection: The midpoint formula didn't surprise me\u2014I expected a simple average since both x-coordinates are identical. And since the midpoint formula isn\u2019t restricted to only horizontal lines, this approach makes sense for vertical lines like ours.\n\n\"Actually, I didn't need to overthink the geometry because the math aligned perfectly with what the sketch suggested.\"\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nAfter considering different angles and verifying calculations: \n\nThe sum of the coordinates of the midpoint is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).\n\nYes, this makes sense, and all steps add up correctly. No second thoughts here, I feel confident in this calculation.",
