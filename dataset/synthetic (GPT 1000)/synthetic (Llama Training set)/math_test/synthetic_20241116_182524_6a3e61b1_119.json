    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step. The question asks for the positive difference between the greatest and least prime factors of 2000. Let's break it down.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n- First, what comes to mind is to factorize 2000 to identify its prime factors. This reminds me of problems involving finding the least and greatest common divisors.\n- Since factorization seems necessary, let me list out the factors systematically.\n\n### Factorization Approach\n1. **Understand what we need to do**: \n   - Identify prime numbers that divide 2000.\n   - Find the smallest (least) and largest (greatest) prime factor.\n   - Calculate the positive difference between these prime factors.\n\n2. **Start with 2000**:\n   - I know 2000 ends with a zero, so it is divisible by 10. That might help us simplify it step by step.\n   - Let\u2019s write 2000 as \\( 2000 = 2^m \\times 5^n \\times \\text{other primes}\\).\n\n3. **Find the prime factors**:\n   - Divide by 2 (smallest prime) first, as 2000 is clearly even:\n     - 2000 \u00f7 2 = 1000\n     - 1000 \u00f7 2 = 500\n     - 500 \u00f7 2 = 250\n     - 250 \u00f7 2 = 125 (not divisible by 2 anymore, move to next prime)\n   - Now check with the next smallest prime number:\n     - 125 \u00f7 5 = 25\n     - 25 \u00f7 5 = 5\n     - 5 \u00f7 5 = 1 \n   - This confirms the prime factorization: \\( 2000 = 2^4 \\times 5^3 \\).\n\n4. **Identify least and greatest prime factors**:\n   - The least prime factor is clearly 2.\n   - The greatest prime factor, from our factorization, is 5.\n\n5. **Calculate the positive difference**:\n   - Difference = Greatest prime factor - Least prime factor = 5 - 2 = 3.\n\n### Reflection and Conclusion:\n- Checking the factorization: Breaking down 2000 correctly, and ensuring that 2 and 5 are the correct and only prime factors was straightforward.\n- The approach seems solid, and all steps logically check out.\n- Is there something I missed? I reviewed, but all calculations and steps verify that the problem was correctly addressed according to standard approaches.\n\n### Final Answer:\n- The positive difference between the greatest and least prime factors of 2000 is 3.",

  "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of 2000 is $2^4 \\times 5^3$ (build a factor tree if you need to see it). The greatest prime factor is 5 and the smallest prime factor is 2.  The difference is $5-2=\\boxed{3}$."
