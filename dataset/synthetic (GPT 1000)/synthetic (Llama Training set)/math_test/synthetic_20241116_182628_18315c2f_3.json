    "working_out": "Okay, let's get into this problem and think through it step by step. \n\n### First Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see this problem, it immediately reminds me of something called the Remainder Theorem. Also, the concept of dividing polynomials and getting remainders as done in high school algebra comes to mind. The problem is asking for the remainder when dividing by a product of two linear terms, so this likely relates to that field of study. \n\n### Understanding the Question\n\nThe problem states two important pieces of information:\n1. When \\( p(x) \\) is divided by \\( x - 1 \\), the remainder is 3.\n2. When \\( p(x) \\) is divided by \\( x - 3 \\), the remainder is 5. \n\nWe need to find the remainder when \\( p(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 3) \\).\n\n### Possible Approaches\n\n1. **Remainder Polynomial**: One natural way is to use the polynomial remainder theorem. This tells us that when a polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is divided by a linear term, say \\( x - a \\), the remainder is the value at \\( p(a) \\). \n\n2. **System of Equations**: If I assume the remainder is of the form \\( ax + b \\) (since \\((x - 1)(x - 3) \\) is quadratic, the remainder has to be of a lower degree, hence linear), I can set up equations using the given conditions.\n\n3. **Reflect on Simplicity**: It feels like maybe this could be done with simple substitution. Find expressions for \\( p(1)\\) and \\( p(3) \\) to match the remainders. \n\n### Strategy Selection\n\nFor now, I'll pursue the Remainder Polynomial approach combined with the System of Equations due to the straightforward algebra involved, and see if it works:\n\n### Using System of Equations\n\nLet's assume the remainder when \\( p(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 3) \\) is a polynomial of degree less than 2, say \\( ax + b \\).\n\nSo:\n\\[ p(x) = (x-1)(x-3)q(x) + ax + b \\]\n\nFrom the problem, substituting \\( x=1 \\):\n\\[ p(1) = a(1) + b = 3 \\]\n\\[ a + b = 3 \\] \n\nSimilarly, substituting \\( x=3 \\):\n\\[ p(3) = a(3) + b = 5 \\]\n\\[ 3a + b = 5 \\]\n\n### Solving the System of Equations\n\nNow, let's solve these equations:\n\nFrom the equations:\n1. \\( a + b = 3 \\)\n2. \\( 3a + b = 5 \\)\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n\\[ (3a + b) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \\]\n\\[ 2a = 2 \\]\n\\[ a = 1 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( a = 1 \\) back into \\( a + b = 3 \\):\n\\[ 1 + b = 3 \\]\n\\[ b = 2 \\]\n\n### Verification\n\nTherefore, the remainder polynomial \\( ax + b = 1x + 2 = x + 2 \\).\n\nSo, when \\( p(x) \\) is divided by \\((x - 1)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( x + 2 \\). I quickly verified this by checking each step, ensuring the arithmetic and logical processes were correct, checking \n\\u003c/u003e against polynomials behavior with remainders. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe remainder when the polynomial \\( p(x) \\) is divided by \\((x-1)(x-3)\\) is \\( x + 2 \\). That approach worked smoothly, and reflecting on it, all aspects seemed logically aligned with my understanding of the polynomial division and remainder theorem.",

  "ground_truth": "By the Remainder Theorem, $p(1) = 3,$ and $p(3) = 5.$\n\nLet $q(x)$ and $ax + b$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when the polynomial $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - 1)(x - 3),$ so\n\\[p(x) = (x - 1)(x - 3) q(x) + ax + b.\\]Setting $x = 1,$ we get $p(1) = a + b,$ so $a + b = 3.$  Setting $x = 3,$ we get $p(3) = 3a + b,$ so $3a + b = 5.$  Solving, we find $a = 1$ and $b = 2.$\n\nTherefore, the remainder is $\\boxed{x + 2}.$"
