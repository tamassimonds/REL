    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step while capturing my thought process. We want to find the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle \\(ABC\\) with sides \\(AB = 10\\), \\(AC = 17\\), and \\(BC = 21\\). This is known as the inradius, denoted as \\(r\\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Identify the Problem Type:** Triangle, sides given, find inradius. This is related to area and semiperimeter calculation, possibly using Heron's formula and inradius formula.\n   \n2. **Formula Recall:** The inradius \\(r\\) can be found by the formula \\(r = \\frac{A}{s}\\), where \\(A\\) is the area of the triangle, and \\(s\\) is the semiperimeter.\n\n3. **Initial Strategy:** Let's calculate the semiperimeter \\(s\\) first, then area \\(A\\) using Heron's formula, and finally the inradius \\(r\\).\n\n**Step-by-step Process:**\n\n1. **Calculate Semiperimeter (\\(s\\)):**\n\n   \\(s = \\frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \\frac{10 + 17 + 21}{2}\\).\n\n   \\[s = \\frac{48}{2} = 24.\\]\n\n2. **Check:** Is this calculation reasonable? Yes, it looks good. Each step is a direct computation and logically follows from \\(AB\\), \\(AC\\), and \\(BC\\).\n\n3. **Use Heron's formula to find Area (\\(A\\)):**\n\n   Heron's formula is \\(A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\\).\n\n   Substitute \\(a = 10\\), \\(b = 17\\), \\(c = 21\\):\n\n   \\[\n   A = \\sqrt{24 \\cdot (24 - 10) \\cdot (24 - 17) \\cdot (24 - 21)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A = \\sqrt{24 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 3}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate:**\n   - \\(24 - 10 = 14\\)\n   - \\(24 - 17 = 7\\)\n   - \\(24 - 21 = 3\\)\n\n   \\[\n   A = \\sqrt{24 \\times 14 \\times 7 \\times 3}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compute:** Let's calculate \\(24 \\times 14 \\times 7 \\times 3\\):\n\n   \\[\n   = 24 \\cdot 14 = 336\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = 336 \\cdot 7 = 2352\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = 2352 \\cdot 3 = 7056\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   A = \\sqrt{7056}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Approximate \\(A\\):**\n\n   Using a calculator or manual calculation for square root:\n\n   \\(\\sqrt{7056} = 84.\\)\n\n7. **Check:** Does the area calculation feel reasonable? Given the sides, it's reasonable to have a significantly larger area than any given side.\n\n8. **Find Inradius \\(r\\):**\n\n   \\(r = \\frac{A}{s} = \\frac{84}{24} = 3.5.\\)\n\n9. **Final Verification:**\n\n   - Does the final computation seem reasonable?\n   - Double-checked each sub-step again, all logical calculations and intermediate steps were correct.\n\n10. **Conclusion:** The radius of the inscribed circle is \\(3.5\\).\n\nEach step made sense and validated previous steps, leading to our desired solution. The calculations weren't too complex, given the direct application of well-known geometry formulas.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=24$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24\\cdot 14\\cdot 7\\cdot 3} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{2^4 \\cdot 3^2\\cdot 7^2} \\\\\n&= 84.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$84 = r\\cdot 24,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{3.5}$."
