The expression we need to evaluate is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^3\\).\n\nHmm, this really reminds me of basic exponentiation and multiplication steps. Do I remember any shortcuts for dealing with fractions and exponents? Let\u2019s take it step-by-step to ensure no details are missed.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nSo, we've got a fraction \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) raised to the power of 3 and then that result is multiplied by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nI need to figure out \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^3\\) first. A power indicates repeated multiplication, so this can be seen as multiplying \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) by itself three times.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^3\\)**\nThis part involves multiplying \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\nLet's tackle \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4}\\) first:\n- Numerator: \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\)\n- Denominator: \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\)\n  \nSo \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{16}\\).\n\nNext, multiply this result by another \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\):\n- Numerator: \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\)\n- Denominator: \\(16 \\times 4 = 64\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^3 = \\frac{27}{64}\\).\n\n### **Check Your Work:**\nLooking at this, does \\(\\frac{27}{64}\\) seem right for \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^3\\)? Repeated multiplication can sometimes get tricky, but the pattern unfolded as expected with the numeracy part. Also, mentally running through \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4}\\) again confirms it checks out.\n\n### **Step 3: Multiply by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)**\nNow, take \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{27}{64}\\).\nFor this, multiply the numerators and the denominators:\n- Numerator: \\(1 \\times 27 = 27\\)\n- Denominator: \\(2 \\times 64 = 128\\)\n\nResult: \\(\\frac{27}{128}\\).\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\nLet\u2019s pause to ensure the multiplication was done correctly: the arithmetic, both additive and multiplicative for the fraction, seems right. Double-checking with basic mental estimates, \\(\\frac{27}{128}\\) appears reasonable for a fraction further reduced by a half after the cube.\n\nNo glaring errors are jumping out, and the calculations are consistent with fraction rules. \n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe final solution is: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^3 = \\frac{27}{128}\\).\n\nThis problem was mostly about applying consistent rules for exponents and fractions, carefully ensuring each step aligned with expected outcomes. It helps to break it down methodically!",

  "ground_truth": "Recall that $\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^n=\\frac{a^n}{b^n}$. In this case, we have \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3^3}{4^3} = \\frac{3^3}{2\\cdot 4^3} = \\boxed{\\frac{27}{128}}\n\\]"
