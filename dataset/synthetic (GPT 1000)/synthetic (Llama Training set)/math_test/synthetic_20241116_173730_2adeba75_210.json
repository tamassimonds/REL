    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem by engaging in a thought process similar to how we tackle real-world problems.\n\n**First Thoughts**: \n\nThe problem is asking for the shortest distance from a given circle to a specific point. The circle's equation is given in a form that isn't immediately familiar. My first instinct is to rewrite the circle equation in a more recognizable form, probably by completing the square. This problem seems to relate to finding the distance between a point and a circle, where the circle's radius and center play important roles. If it were a simpler point-to-point distance problem, I'd use the distance formula directly.\n\n**Initial Strategy**: \n- Start by transforming the circle equation into its center-radius form.\n- Then, compute the distance from the circle's center to the given point.\n- Finally, determine the shortest distance from the circle to the point by considering the radius.\n\n**Step 1: Rewrite the Circle Equation**\n\nThe given circle equation is \\(x^2 + y^2 = 4x + 8y\\). I want to express it in the standard form of \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\).\n\n**Completing the Square**: \n1. Rearrange terms: \n   - \\(x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 8y = 0\\)\n2. Complete the square for \\(x\\) terms:\n   - Take \\((x^2 - 4x)\\): \n   - The term to complete the square is \\((-4/2)^2 = 4\\).\n   - This becomes \\((x-2)^2 - 4\\).\n3. Complete the square for \\(y\\) terms:\n   - Take \\((y^2 - 8y)\\):\n   - The term to complete the square is \\((-8/2)^2 = 16\\).\n   - This becomes \\((y-4)^2 - 16\\).\n\nSo the complete square form is:\n\\[\n(x-2)^2 - 4 + (y-4)^2 - 16 = 0\n\\]\nCombine constants:\n\\[\n(x-2)^2 + (y-4)^2 = 20\n\\]\n\n**Check**: Quickly verify the completed square steps:\n- \\((x-2)^2\\) expands to \\(x^2 - 4x + 4\\), \n- \\((y-4)^2\\) expands to \\(y^2 - 8y + 16\\), \nwhich simplifies back to original equation correctly. This confirms the squared terms are right.\n\n**Resulting Circle Information**:\n- Center: \\((2, 4)\\)\n- Radius: \\(\\sqrt{20}\\), which simplifies to \\(2\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n**Step 2: Distance from Center to Point \\((5, -2)\\)**\n\nI need to use the distance formula: \n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the center \\((2, 4)\\) of the circle and the given point \\((5, -2)\\):\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (-2 - 4)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 36} = \\sqrt{45}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shortest Distance from Point to Circle**:\n\nThe shortest distance from a point to a circle is exactly when you think of moving along the line joining the point and the circle\u2019s center, discounting the radius from the total distance. The shortest distance \\(D\\) is:\n\\[\nD = \\text{Distance from Center to Point} - \\text{Radius}\n\\]\n- \\(\\sqrt{45} - 2\\sqrt{5}\\)\n\n**Simplifying \\( \\sqrt{45} - 2\\sqrt{5} \\)**:\n\nNotice:\n- \\(\\sqrt{45} = 3\\sqrt{5}\\)\n- Therefore, the shortest distance \\(D\\) becomes:\n\\[\nD = 3\\sqrt{5} - 2\\sqrt{5} = \\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nSo, the indicated \\(m\\) in the problem is \\(m=5\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: \nThe shortest distance from the circle to the point is \\(\\sqrt{5}\\), with \\(m = 5\\). This approach and calculations seem solid upon reviewing each step. I feel confident the solution is correct.",

  "ground_truth": "Completing the square gives $(x-2)^2 + (y-4)^2 = 20$, so the circle has radius $\\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}$ and center $(2,4)$. The distance between $(2,4)$ and $(5,-2)$ is given by $\\sqrt{(2-5)^2 + (4-(-2))^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 36} = \\sqrt{45} = 3\\sqrt{5}$. Hence, the shortest distance is the difference of the distance between the center and the point and the radius, yielding $3\\sqrt{5} - 2\\sqrt{5} = \\sqrt{5}$. Thus, $m = \\boxed{5}$.\n\n[asy]\nimport graph; size(8.33cm); real lsf=0.5; pen dps=linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10); defaultpen(dps); pen ds=black; real xmin=-3.5,xmax=8.83,ymin=-4.5,ymax=9.58;\n\npen ttzzqq=rgb(0.2,0.6,0);\nLabel laxis; laxis.p=fontsize(10);\n\nxaxis(-3.5,8.83,defaultpen+black,Ticks(laxis,Step=2.0,Size=2),Arrows(6),above=true); yaxis(-4.5,9.58,defaultpen+black,Ticks(laxis,Step=2.0,Size=2),Arrows(6),above=true); draw(circle((2,4),4.47)); draw((2,4)--(5,-2)); draw((4,0)--(5,-2),linewidth(1.6)+ttzzqq);\n\nlabel(\"$(x - 2)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 20$\",(0.91,5.41),NE*lsf); dot((5,-2),ds); label(\"$(5, -2)$\",(5.15,-1.75),NE*lsf); dot((2,4),ds); dot((4,0),ds);\n\nclip((xmin,ymin)--(xmin,ymax)--(xmax,ymax)--(xmax,ymin)--cycle);\n\n[/asy]"
