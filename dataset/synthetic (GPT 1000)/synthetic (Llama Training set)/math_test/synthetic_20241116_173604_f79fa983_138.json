    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving the problem: Simplify \\(\\frac{k-3}{2} + 3k + 1 + \\frac{3k+1}{2}\\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts: At first glance, this looks like an algebraic expression that involves fractions. The appearance of \\(\\frac{k-3}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{3k+1}{2}\\) suggests that a common denominator approach could be useful. The presence of similar terms hints that there may be opportunities to combine like terms, which might simplify the expression significantly.\n\n**Step 2: Strategy**\n\nStrategy brainstorming: One option is to directly add the terms with fractions by finding a common denominator. Then we might simplify by combining like terms across the whole expression. Another approach is to work on simplifying each part first before bringing them together.\n\nConsidering the fact that both fractional terms have the same denominator (2), starting with combining these might be straightforward.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Fractions**\n\nCombining the numerators over a common denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{k-3}{2} + \\frac{3k+1}{2} = \\frac{(k-3) + (3k+1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow simplify the numerator:\n\\[\n(k - 3) + (3k + 1) = k - 3 + 3k + 1 = 4k - 2\n\\]\n\nThis gives us:\n\\[\n\\frac{4k - 2}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the Fraction**\n\nDivide each term in the numerator by the denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{4k}{2} - \\frac{2}{2} = 2k - 1\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Combine With the Whole Expression**\n\nNow, incorporate the remaining \\(3k + 1\\) into the expression:\n\\[\n2k - 1 + 3k + 1\n\\]\n\nWhen we combine like terms, we get:\n\\[\n2k + 3k - 1 + 1 = 5k\n\\]\n\n**Reflection and Verification**\n\nQuick check: The expression simplification steps seem logically consistent. Each step followed proper arithmetic and algebraic rules. We went from fractions to whole numbers by using a common denominator and simplified systematically. The numbers add up correctly throughout.\n\nDeep reflection: The approach makes sense since the algebra was kept simple by attending to the fractions first, then coordinating with the rest of the expression. Combining like terms correctly yielded the most straightforward expression.\n\nIn conclusion, the simplified expression is \\(5k\\). This problem reinforced using logical strategies with fractions and careful combination of like terms for simplification.",
