    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and take it step by step.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe goal is to find the product of the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment. The endpoints given are \\((1,1)\\) and \\((-7,5)\\).\n\n- First thoughts: This seems to be a straightforward geometry problem involving the midpoint formula. This usually involves averaging the coordinates of the endpoints. I think I've done this kind of problem before, so I should be able to find the midpoint fairly easily.\n\n**Brainstorming Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Midpoint Formula:** \n    The midpoint \\((x_m, y_m)\\) of a line segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n    \\[\n    x_m = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\quad y_m = \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\n    \\]\n   Using this formula seems to be the most direct approach here.\n\n2. **Graphical Approach:**\n    Plotting the points on a coordinate grid might give a visual confirmation of the midpoint's coordinates. This could be useful as a check, but it\u2019s generally slower and less precise without graph paper.\n\n3. **Check and Verify:**\n    After calculating the midpoint using the formula, I'll double-check by substituting the endpoints back into the formula to ensure the calculations make sense.\n\n**Calculating the Midpoint:**\n\nLet's apply the midpoint formula using the given endpoints \\((1,1)\\) and \\((-7,5)\\).\n\n1. **Calculate the x-coordinate:**\n    \\[\n    x_m = \\frac{1 + (-7)}{2} = \\frac{1 - 7}{2} = \\frac{-6}{2} = -3\n    \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the y-coordinate:**\n    \\[\n    y_m = \\frac{1 + 5}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n    \\]\n\n**Midpoint:**\nThe midpoint is \\((-3, 3)\\).\n\n**Checking Work:**\n\nI should pause here to ensure these calculations seem correct.\n\n- Recalculating quickly: \n  - For x: \\(\\frac{1 - 7}{2} = \\frac{-6}{2} = -3\\), checks out.\n  - For y: \\(\\frac{6}{2} = 3\\), also checks out.\n\n- Reflecting: the negative sign looks correct because the midpoint x is left of the origin, which matches the endpoint inputs.\n\n**Finding the Product of Coordinates:**\n\nNow, I need to find the product of the coordinates \\((-3, 3)\\).\n\n\\[\nx_m \\cdot y_m = -3 \\cdot 3 = -9\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThis seems correct. The process flows logically from understanding the problem, applying a suitable formula, and confirming via quick checks. There's no indication of an error.\n\n- Additional Check: Intuition makes me think: a midpoint lying in the desired quadrant (here, quadrant II) confirms the negative x and positive y, consistent with the selected endpoints.\n\nThe product of the coordinates of the midpoint is \\(-9\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We see that the midpoint has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{1 + (-7)}{2}, \\frac{1+5}{2}\\right) = (-3, 3)$.  Thus our desired answer is $-3\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{-9}$."
