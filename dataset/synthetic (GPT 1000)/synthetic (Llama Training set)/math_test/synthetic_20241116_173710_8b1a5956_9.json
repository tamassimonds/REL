    "working_out": "First thoughts: This problem involves finding a 2x2 matrix, which when raised to the power of three equals a given matrix. The structure of the matrix is also specified, which might help in simplifying our calculations. Given the form of the matrix \\(\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & d \\end{pmatrix}\\), it seems like diagonalization or using some properties of triangular matrices could be helpful. Raising matrices to powers often reminds me of eigenvalues, but here the structure is simpler, so maybe there's a more straightforward method.\n\nExploring different strategies: \n\n1. **Direct calculation strategy**: Calculate \\(\\mathbf{M}^3\\) using multiplication rules for triangular matrices. Let's multiply step-by-step and see how the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(d\\) interact.\n\n2. **Eigenvalue strategy**: Since \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) is triangular, its eigenvalues are on its diagonal, which might make it simpler to deal with. Could we potentially solve for the eigenvalues and use them to determine \\(a\\) and \\(d\\)? I need to keep in mind that the off-diagonal element \\(b\\) will play a role in reaching the specific result given.\n\nLet's try the first approach:\n\n**Direct calculation:**\n\n1. Calculate \\(\\mathbf{M}^2\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{M}^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 & ab + bd \\\\ 0 & d^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n   Hmm, that makes sense. The structure of triangular matrices simplifies multiplication because of all the zeros. Now let's move on to cubing it.\n\n2. Calculate \\(\\mathbf{M}^3\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{M}^3 = \\mathbf{M}^2 \\cdot \\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 & ab + bd \\\\ 0 & d^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a^3 & a^2b + abd + bd^2 \\\\ 0 & d^3 \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n3. Equate \\(\\mathbf{M}^3\\) to \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 8 & -57 \\\\ 0 & 27 \\end{pmatrix}\\):\n\n   - \\(a^3 = 8\\)\n   - \\(a^2b + abd + bd^2 = -57\\)\n   - \\(d^3 = 27\\)\n\n**Reflect on these equations:**\n\n- From \\(a^3 = 8\\), the simplest choice is \\(a = 2\\), as \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n- From \\(d^3 = 27\\), the simplest choice is \\(d = 3\\), as \\(3^3 = 27\\).\n\nLet's check if these values fit the equation for \\(b\\):\n\nSimplifying \\(a^2b + abd + bd^2 = -57\\):\n\n- Substitue \\(a = 2\\) and \\(d = 3\\):\n\n  \\[\n  4b + 6b + 9b = 19b = -57\n  \\]\n\n- Solve for \\(b\\):\n\n  \\[\n  b = \\frac{-57}{19} = -3\n  \\]\n\nReflect on the solution: \n\n- The choice of \\(a = 2\\), \\(d = 3\\), and \\(b = -3\\) satisfies all the equations we derived.\n  \nLet's verify the full multiplication:\n\n- Check \\(a^3 = 2^3 = 8\\) and \\(d^3 = 3^3 = 27\\).\n- Substitute \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = -3\\), \\(d = 3\\), we got \\(a^2b + abd + bd^2 = 4(-3) + 6(-3) + 9(-3) = -57\\).\n\nThese calculations match our target matrix exactly.\n\nConclusion: The matrix satisfying the given condition is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -3 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThis problem required applying properties of triangular matrices and dealing with their structure carefully to find a suitable set of parameters \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(d\\). The approach worked effectively due to the simplicity inherent in the specified form of \\(\\mathbf{M}\\).",
