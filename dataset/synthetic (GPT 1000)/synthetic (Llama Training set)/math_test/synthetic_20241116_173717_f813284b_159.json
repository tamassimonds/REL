    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\n- The problem asks for the number of even positive integers less than \\(ab\\). So, the first thing I want to find is the product \\(ab\\).\n- From there, it sounds like a counting problem where I need to identify the even numbers below this product.\n- My initial thought is to calculate the product and then explore if I can directly determine how many even numbers fall below it either by enumeration or a formula.\n\nStep 1: Calculate \\(ab\\).\n\n- Given \\(a = 7\\) and \\(b = 13\\), compute \\(ab = 7 \\times 13\\).\n- I'm realizing that \\(7 \\times 13\\) isn't something I can calculate immediately in my head, so I'll work it out: \n  - \\(7 \\times 10 = 70\\)\n  - \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\)\n  - Adding these together: \\(70 + 21 = 91\\).\n- So, \\(ab = 91\\).\n\nStep 2: Identify the even numbers less than 91.\n\n- Even numbers are those divisible by 2.\n- I want to count all even numbers from 2 up to but not including 91.\n- It might help to list a few or see a pattern: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., up to 90.\n- Now, to find how many there are, notice: \n\nGiven that even numbers are spaced by 2, they form an arithmetic sequence: \n  - First even number is 2.\n  - Last even number less than 91 is 90.\n- The sequence formula for the nth term \\(n = a_1 + (k-1) \\times d\\) can help: here \\(n = 90\\), \\(a_1 = 2\\), and \\(d = 2\\).\n  \nStep 3: Calculate the number of terms in the sequence.\n\n- Set the last term of the sequence equation as 90: \n  \\[ 90 = 2 + (k-1) \\times 2 \\]\n- Simplifying:\n  \\[ 90 - 2 = (k-1) \\times 2 \\]\n  \\[ 88 = (k-1) \\times 2 \\]\n  \\[ 44 = k-1 \\]\n  \\[ k = 45 \\]\n\n- There are 45 even numbers less than 91.\n\nStep 4: Reflect and check:\n\n- Let's double-check our arithmetic: The sequence increments by 2, thus it's every even number from 2 to 90 inclusive.\n- Plugging a few values in the sequence equation should confirm:\n  - The sequence indeed starts at 2 and ends at 90.\n  - 44 steps from 2 to 90, or 45 numbers in total.\n\n- Final check: About \\(ab = 91\\) \u2014 it fits that there are exactly 45 even numbers below 91.\n\nConclusion: \n\n- The process makes sense, and all the steps check out upon review.\n- The number of even positive integers less than 91 is \\( \\boxed{45} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since $a$ and $b$ are both odd, then $ab$ is odd. Therefore, the largest even integer less than $ab$ is $ab-1$.\n\nSince every other positive integer less than or equal to $ab-1$ is even,  then the number of even positive integers less than or equal to $ab-1$ (thus, less than $ab$) is  $$\\frac{ab-1}{2} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 13 - 1}{2} = \\boxed{45}.$$"
