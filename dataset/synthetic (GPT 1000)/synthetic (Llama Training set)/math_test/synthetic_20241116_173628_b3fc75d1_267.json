    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. It's asking us to find the average of all positive integers that have four digits in base 3 and two digits in base 6. Let's start by breaking this down.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nThe problem is essentially about converting numbers between different bases and finding out which numbers satisfy all given conditions. We want to:\n\n1. **Identify Numbers with Four Digits in Base 3:** A four-digit number in base 3 has digits in the range of 0 to 2. The smallest four-digit number in base 3 is \\(1000_3\\) and the largest is \\(2222_3\\).\n2. **Identify Numbers with Two Digits in Base 6:** A two-digit number in base 6 has digits in the range of 0 to 5. The smallest two-digit number in base 6 is \\(10_6\\) and the largest is \\(55_6\\).\n3. Both criteria must be satisfied.\n\n### Step 2: Conversion from Base 3 to Base 10\n\nLet's convert the smallest and largest four-digit numbers from base 3 to base 10 to find the range.\n\n- **Convert \\(1000_3\\) to base 10:**\n  \n  \\[\n  1000_3 = 1 \\cdot 3^3 + 0 \\cdot 3^2 + 0 \\cdot 3^1 + 0 \\cdot 3^0 = 27_{10}\n  \\]\n\n- **Convert \\(2222_3\\) to base 10:**\n\n  \\[\n  2222_3 = 2 \\cdot 3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3^2 + 2 \\cdot 3^1 + 2 \\cdot 3^0 = 54 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 80_{10}\n  \\]\n\nSo, in base 10, these numbers range from 27 to 80.\n\n### Step 3: Conversion from Base 6 to Base 10\n\nLet's convert the smallest and largest two-digit numbers from base 6 to base 10 for comparison.\n\n- **Convert \\(10_6\\) to base 10:**\n\n  \\[\n  10_6 = 1 \\cdot 6^1 + 0 \\cdot 6^0 = 6_{10}\n  \\]\n\n- **Convert \\(55_6\\) to base 10:**\n\n  \\[\n  55_6 = 5 \\cdot 6^1 + 5 \\cdot 6^0 = 30 + 5 = 35_{10}\n  \\]\n\nSo, in base 10, numbers with two digits in base 6 range from 6 to 35.\n\n### Step 4: Overlap of Ranges\n\nNow, we need to find the overlap between numbers that are four digits in base 3 (\\(27_{10}\\) to \\(80_{10}\\)) and two digits in base 6 (\\(6_{10}\\) to \\(35_{10}\\)).\n\nClearly, both conditions will be satisfied for numbers in the range of \\(27_{10}\\) to \\(35_{10}\\).\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Average\n\nLet's list out these numbers: 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35.\n\nTo find their average, sum them up and then divide by the count of the numbers.\n\nSum = \\(27 + 28 + 29 + 30 + 31 + 32 + 33 + 34 + 35\\)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = (27 + 35) + (28 + 34) + (29 + 33) + (30 + 32) + 31 = 62 + 62 + 62 + 62 + 31 = 279\n\\]\n\nThere are 9 numbers in total.\n\nAverage = \\(\\frac{279}{9} = 31\\)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the average of all positive integers that meet the conditions specified in the problem is \\(31\\) in base 10.",

  "ground_truth": "If an integer $n$ has four digits in base $3$, then $3^3\\le n<3^4$. If an integer $n$ has two digits in base $6$, then $6^1\\le n<6^2$. The overlap of these intervals is $$\\{27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35\\}.$$The average of the integers in this set is $\\frac{27+35}{2} = \\boxed{31}$."
