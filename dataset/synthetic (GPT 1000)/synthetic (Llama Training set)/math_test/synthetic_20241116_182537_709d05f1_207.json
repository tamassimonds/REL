    "working_out": "**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The question is asking for the probability of not selecting a baseball shirt when one shirt is picked randomly.\n- Probability requires a good understanding of the total number of choices and the number of favorable outcomes.\n- The total number of shirts and the number of non-baseball shirts will be crucial to solving this problem.\n- This problem reminds me of basic probability concepts, which involve favorable outcomes divided by total possible outcomes.\n\n**Brainstorming Solutions:**\n\n- Calculate the total number of shirts Morgan has.\n- Find out how many shirts are not baseball shirts (favorable outcomes).\n- Use fractions to express the probability of picking a non-baseball shirt.\n\n**Step-by-step Approach:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Shirts:**\n   - Morgan has 3 hockey shirts, 2 football shirts, and 7 baseball shirts.\n   - Total shirts = 3 + 2 + 7\n   - Let me add these up: \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) and then \\(5 + 7 = 12\\).\n   - Total shirts = 12\n\n2. **Determine Non-baseball Shirts:**\n   - Non-baseball shirts include hockey and football shirts.\n   - Hockey shirts = 3, Football shirts = 2\n   - Non-baseball shirts = 3 + 2\n   - Let me add these up: \\(3 + 2 = 5\\).\n   - So, there are 5 non-baseball shirts.\n\n3. **Calculate Probability:**\n   - Probability of an event = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes).\n   - Here, favorable outcomes are non-baseball shirts, which is 5.\n   - Total possible outcomes are total shirts, which is 12.\n   - Probability = \\( \\frac{5}{12} \\).\n\n4. **Reflection and Verification:**\n   - Let me check if I calculated each part correctly:\n     - Total number of shirts was calculated as 12; seems right since \\(3 + 2 + 7 = 12\\).\n     - Non-baseball shirts calculated as 5, considering hockey and football shirts; \\(3 + 2 = 5\\), also seems right.\n   - The fraction \\( \\frac{5}{12} \\) makes sense since it represents the ratio of non-baseball shirts to the total.\n   - Numbers are reasonable given typical shirt counts; nothing seems off.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- I didn't encounter any major issues or need to change the approach.\n- The answer \\( \\frac{5}{12} \\) reflects the steps and logic used to resolve the probability question.\n- This approach should accurately reflect the intended solution for picking a non-baseball shirt.",

  "ground_truth": "There are $3+2 + 7 =12$ shirts to choose from. A total of $2+3 = 5$ of these, all the hockey and football shirts, are not baseball shirts. So, the probability of not getting a baseball shirt is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}$."
