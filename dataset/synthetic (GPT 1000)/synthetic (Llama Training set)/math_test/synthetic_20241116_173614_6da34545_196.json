    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. Here we go:\n\n**First Impressions:**\n- This looks like a problem involving inverse proportionality. My brain is nudging me towards the concept: \"When one variable increases, the other decreases.\"\n- I remember that for inverse proportionality, the product of the two variables is constant. So, in mathematical terms, \\( p \\times q = k \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\n**Understanding the Given Information:**\n- I have \\( p = 28 \\) when \\( q = 7 \\). \n- My initial thought is to calculate this constant \\( k \\) because knowing \\( k \\) will allow me to find any corresponding pair of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n**Calculating the Constant \\( k \\):**\n- Using the relation for inverse proportionality, \\( p \\times q = k \\), I substitute \\( p = 28 \\) and \\( q = 7 \\).\n- So, \\( 28 \\times 7 = k \\).\n- I need to do this multiplication: \\( 28 \\times 7 = 196 \\).\n- Great, now I have \\( k = 196 \\).\n\n**Setting Up to Solve for the New Value of \\( p \\):**\n- I need to find \\( p \\) when \\( q = 49 \\).\n- Using my \\( k \\), which is 196, I set up the equation: \\( p \\times 49 = 196 \\).\n\n**Solving for \\( p \\):**\n- I can find \\( p \\) by rearranging the equation to \\( p = \\frac{196}{49} \\).\n- Now, I need to divide 196 by 49 to find \\( p \\).\n\n**Checking the Division:**\n- Let's do the division: \\( 196 \\div 49 \\).\n- I think about whether 49 could be a factor of 196. Turns out it is a known fact (or can be calculated) that 196 is equal to \\( 49 \\times 4 \\).\n- Thus, \\( \\frac{196}{49} = 4 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The value of \\( p \\) when \\( q = 49 \\) is \\( p = 4 \\).\n\n**Reflecting:**\n- This makes sense because as \\( q \\) increases from 7 to 49, according to inverse proportionality, \\( p \\) should decrease.\n- Calculating again, just to ensure there are no errors: \\( 196 \\div 49 = 4 \\), confirmed.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- Everything checks out. Both the logic of inverse proportionality and the calculations seem correct.\n- I\u2019m confident the value I found is right. So, \\( p = 4 \\) when \\( q = 49 \\). Perfect.",

  "ground_truth": "If $p$ and $q$ are inversely proportional, then $p\\cdot{q}=k$ (where $k$ is a constant). We know that $p=28$ when $q=7$, so $(28)(7)=k$ or $k=196$. Thus when $q=49$, $(p)(49)=196$ and $p=\\boxed{4}$."
