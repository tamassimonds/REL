    "working_out": "Alright, let's delve into this and explore each option step by step. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- This problem looks like it involves basic inequalities. I recall that when working with inequalities, multiplying or dividing by a negative number flips the inequality sign.\n- I need to figure out which of these inequalities must always hold true given the conditions \\( a < c \\) and \\( b < 0 \\).\n- My gut feeling tells me that each of these options will need to be checked independently using various strategies like substitution or general property observation.\n\n**Option A: \\( ab < ac \\)**\n- Let's break this down. Both sides can be expressed in terms of multiplication through \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n- I know \\( a < c \\) and \\( b < 0 \\).\n- I'm aware that multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number (like \\( b \\) here) will flip the inequality.\n- Hmm, by multiplying both sides of \\( a < c \\) with a negative \\( b \\), the inequality should flip: \\( ab > cb \\). So, contrary to \\( ab < ac \\), it actually should be \\( ab > ac \\) when \\( b < 0 \\).\n- Okay, this can't be right. This one isn't always true. \n\n**Option B: \\( a + b < c + b \\)**\n- This looks like an addition problem. Rewriting it simplifies the comparison: \\( a < c \\), which is given to us in the problem.\n- Adding \\( b \\), which is identical on both sides, doesn't change the inequality direction.\n- Quick check confirms this feels correct since it's the original statement just adjusted with an additional element that is equal on both sides.\n- Yes, this should hold true regardless of \\( b \\).\n- So, this one is true.\n\n**Option C: \\( a - b < c - b \\)**\n- This option involves subtraction and can be rewritten as \\( a < c \\).\n- Again, subtraction of the same number from both sides of an inequality doesn't change the inequality.\n- It's essentially the original inequality, just offset by \\( b \\), which doesn't affect the relation.\n- Feels good; let's see if this matches our conditions.\n- Oh, another reinforcement: If \\( a < c \\) is true, so should be this adjusted form.\n- Yes, this is true.\n\n**Option D: \\( c/a > 1 \\)**\n- I can rewrite this as \\( c > a \\) assuming \\( a > 0 \\) but that's not given.\n- Ah, \\( a \\) could be negative, which complicates this. If \\( a < 0 \\), the division by a negative number could invert the inequality.\n- Testing with example values may help, e.g., \\( a = -1, c = 1 \\) gives \\( c/a = -1 \\), which is NOT greater than 1.\n- Realization moment here: The truth of this statement really depends on whether \\( a \\) is positive or negative.\n- This isn't guaranteed by the problem statement, so this option might not always be true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Reviewing my deductions, I conclude options B and C always hold based on the given inequality conditions.\n- Therefore, the correct options are: **B, C**.",

  "ground_truth": "If we consider a negative $a$ and a positive $c$, we can see that this is not true.\nIf we subtract $b$ from both sides we get $a<c$ which we know is true.\nAdding $b$ to both sides again gives us $a<c$ which we know is true.\nAgain, if we consider a negative $a$ and a positive $c$, we see that $c/a$ is negative and hence not greater than $1$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{B, C}$."
