    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step-by-step, just like I would if I were solving it in my notebook.\n\n### Understanding the Problem:\n\nFirst, I'm looking at the problem and trying to understand what the diagram is telling me. It looks like there's a line \\( l \\) and some angles associated with it. We're asked to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\n- The diagram shows that one angle is labeled as \\( x \\).\n- Another angle is given as \\( x + 20^\\circ \\).\n\nMy first thought is: \"This looks similar to the concept of linear pairs or supplementary angles, with line \\( l \\) being straight. That might be key.\"\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies:\n\n1. **Linear Pair or Supplementary Angles:**\n   - If line \\( l \\) is straight, then the angles meeting on the line should add up to \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n   - This seems like a great initial approach to explore.\n\n2. **Geometric Properties:**\n   - Think about basic geometric properties that might apply here. \n   - Are there any other angles related by alternate interior angles, corresponding angles, etc.?\n\n3. **Redraw the Situation:**\n   - Sometimes redrawing helps in understanding. \n   - I can imagine a straight line and the angles around it more clearly.\n\n4. **Calculate/Set Up an Equation:**\n   - If the angles sum up to \\( 180^\\circ \\), set up an equation to find \\( x \\).\n\n### Execution Step-by-Step:\n\n- **Step 1:** Visualize the scenario given that line \\( l \\) is a straight line. \n  - The two angles adjacent to line \\( l \\) should form a straight angle, equating to \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n  \n- **Step 2:** Since \\( x \\) and \\( x+20^\\circ \\) lie on a straight line, they form a linear pair.\n  - So, the equation should be \\( x + (x + 20^\\circ) = 180^\\circ \\).\n\n- **Step 3:** Simplify the equation.\n  - \\( x + x + 20^\\circ = 180^\\circ \\).\n  - Combine like terms: \\( 2x + 20^\\circ = 180^\\circ \\).\n\n- **Step 4:** Solve for \\( x \\).\n  - Subtract \\( 20^\\circ \\) from both sides: \\( 2x = 160^\\circ \\).\n  - Divide both sides by 2: \\( x = 80^\\circ \\).\n\n### Reflection and Checking:\n\n- Is \\( x = 80^\\circ \\) reasonable? I should check if this makes sense in the context:\n  - If \\( x = 80^\\circ \\), then \\( x + 20^\\circ = 100^\\circ \\).\n  - The check on \\( 80^\\circ + 100^\\circ = 180^\\circ \\) confirms that the angles indeed form a linear pair correctly and fit together to make a straight angle on line \\( l \\).\n\n- Consider if there could be another approach or another solution.\n  - With the constraints given (a straight line implies a linear pair), there doesn't seem to be any missed logic or alternate scenario.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe value of \\( x \\) is \\( \\boxed{80^\\circ} \\).\n\nThat process felt thorough. I backtracked my steps to ensure no calculation errors and that my thought process aligned with the principles of geometry. It\u2019s good to go!",

  "ground_truth": "Since the two angles together form a line, we have $x+ (x+20^\\circ) = 180^\\circ$.  Simplifying gives $2x + 20^\\circ = 180^\\circ$, so $2x = 160^\\circ$ and $x = \\boxed{80^\\circ}$."
