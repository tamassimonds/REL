    "working_out": "Let's dig into this problem! I'm looking at something with distances and a determinant, which is intriguing. My first thought is that maybe there's a geometric interpretation since we're dealing with distances between pairs of points in a plane. This has me thinking about triangles and potentially areas.\n\nOkay, quick recap of what we're given:\n\n- Three pairs of real numbers \\((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3)\\).\n- We've got three distance equations. These sound exactly like the distances between points in a plane:\n  - \\((x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 = 9\\) corresponds to the distance between \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\).\n  - \\((x_1 - x_3)^2 + (y_1 - y_3)^2 = 16\\) for \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_3, y_3)\\).\n  - \\((x_2 - x_3)^2 + (y_2 - y_3)^2 = 25\\) for \\((x_2, y_2)\\) and \\((x_3, y_3)\\).\n\nSeeing all these distances makes me think about the sides of a triangle. So: might these be the side lengths?\n\n- If the distances are root lengths, then: \n  - \\( \\sqrt{9} = 3\\),\n  - \\( \\sqrt{16} = 4\\),\n  - \\( \\sqrt{25} = 5\\).\n\nThese are familiar numbers. Do they form a right triangle? Let\u2019s check with Pythagoras: \\(3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2\\). Yes, they form a right triangle! That feels promising because right triangles often simplify problems like this.\n\nNow, we've to find the square of the determinant:\n\n\\[\nD = \\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\\\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThis determinant's absolute value actually gives twice the area of the triangle formed by these points according to the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices coordinates.\n\nSo, let's calculate the area of a triangle with these side lengths.\n\n### Calculating Area:\n\nTo find the area (A) of a right triangle with legs of lengths \\(3\\) and \\(4\\):\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 4 = 6. \\]\n\nThis means the determinant\u2019s absolute value is \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\).\n\n### Calculate \\(D^2\\):\n\nGiven the problem asks for \\(D^2\\):\n\n\\[\nD^2 = 12^2 = 144.\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion & Reflection:**\n\nReflecting over the steps, it makes sense. The distances were sides of a right triangle, and using that, the area could be calculated straightforwardly. Then, doubling it aligned with the formula for the determinant corresponding to twice the triangle's area. The calculations seem consistent with geometric principles. Let\u2019s see, or there might have been alternative approaches.\n\nEverything checks out, so the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{144}\n\\]",
