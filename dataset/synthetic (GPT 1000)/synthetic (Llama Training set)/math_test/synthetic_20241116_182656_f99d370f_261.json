    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and explore it step-by-step. First, we need to internalize and brainstorm how to approach the problem.\n\n### First Thoughts:\n- When I see variables like \\( x \\), \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\), \\( y \\), \\(\\frac{1}{y}\\), \\( z \\), and \\(\\frac{1}{z}\\) and I'm told they are all integers, I immediately think about the constraints on such numbers. For a number and its reciprocal to both be integers, the number must be either 1 or -1. Why? Because for other integers, the reciprocal isn't an integer.\n- So, \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) can only be 1 or -1. This narrows down possibilities significantly.\n\n### Possible Cases:\n- Each of \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) can be independently 1 or -1. I should enumerate these possibilities.\n  \n### Exploring Different Combinations:\n1. \\( x = 1, y = 1, z = 1 \\)\n   - Sum: \\( x + y + z = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\)\n2. \\( x = 1, y = 1, z = -1 \\)\n   - Sum: \\( x + y + z = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1 \\)\n3. \\( x = 1, y = -1, z = 1 \\)\n   - Sum: \\( x + y + z = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 \\)\n4. \\( x = 1, y = -1, z = -1 \\)\n   - Sum: \\( x + y + z = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \\)\n5. \\( x = -1, y = 1, z = 1 \\)\n   - Sum: \\( x + y + z = -1 + 1 + 1 = 1 \\)\n6. \\( x = -1, y = 1, z = -1 \\)\n   - Sum: \\( x + y + z = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 \\)\n7. \\( x = -1, y = -1, z = 1 \\)\n   - Sum: \\( x + y + z = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1 \\)\n8. \\( x = -1, y = -1, z = -1 \\)\n   - Sum: \\( x + y + z = -1 - 1 - 1 = -3 \\)\n\n### Checking for Distinct Values:\n- Let's check for distinct sums from all possible cases:\n  - 3, 1, -1, and -3\n\n### Final Thoughts:\n- The distinct values of \\( x + y + z \\) that can be obtained are 3, 1, -1, and -3.\n- These cover all the possible combinations of \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) each being either 1 or -1.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere are 4 distinct sums: \\(3, 1, -1,\\) and \\(-3\\).\n\nI naturally broke down the possible combinations, confirmed there are no missed cases, and checked for distinguishing sums. Good, this matches the expectation because each variable being 1 or -1 offers a manageable number of combinations, leading us to an elegant solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $x$ and $1/x$ are integers, we know that $x$ is an integer that divides 1 evenly.  Therefore, we must have $x = -1$ or $x = 1$. The same is true for $y$ and $z$. So, the possible sums are $3(-1) = -3$, $2(-1) + 1 = -1$, $2(1) + -1 = 1$ or $3(1) = 3$. So there are $\\boxed{4}$ possible values for the sum."
