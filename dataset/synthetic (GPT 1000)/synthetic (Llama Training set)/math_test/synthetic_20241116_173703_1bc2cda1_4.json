    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem. First, I want to really understand what is being asked here. The question is about finding the average speed of Jack's entire journey. Jack drives for two separate stretches of time at two different speeds. \n\nThis looks similar to problems I've seen before where we're calculating average speed based on different segments of a journey. I know that the average speed isn't just the arithmetic mean of the two speeds because the distances and times for each segment might not be equal.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Average Speed**\nAverage speed, by definition, is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. This is important because it tells me that both the distances and the time are relevant in finding the average speed.\n\n**Step 2: Break Down Each Segment of the Journey**\n- **Segment 1:** Jack drives at 40 mph for 1 hour.\n- **Segment 2:** Jack drives at 50 mph for 1 hour.\n\nFor each segment, I can calculate the distance Jack travels.\n\n**Segment 1 Calculation:**\n- Speed = 40 mph, Time = 1 hour, so Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 40 mph \u00d7 1 hour = 40 miles.\n\n**Segment 2 Calculation:**\n- Speed = 50 mph, Time = 1 hour, so Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 50 mph \u00d7 1 hour = 50 miles.\n\nI'm starting to see that these distances and times can directly help me determine the average speed.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Total Distance and Total Time**\n- **Total Distance = Distance from Segment 1 + Distance from Segment 2 = 40 miles + 50 miles = 90 miles.**\n- **Total Time = Time from Segment 1 + Time from Segment 2 = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.**\n\nThese calculations are straightforward, but let's reflect: Considering each leg separately helped me verify that I'm on track. The numbers seem reasonable because Jack traveled faster in the second leg, covering more distance.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Average Speed**\nNow, to find the average speed, use the formula:\n\nAverage Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 90 miles / 2 hours = 45 mph.\n\nLet me double-check: This makes sense because the average speed is between the two speeds (40 mph and 50 mph), which feels intuitive since neither speed dominated the journey\u2014Jack spent equal time at each speed.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe average speed of Jack's entire journey is 45 mph. Thinking through each piece, verifying calculations, and reflecting on the reasonableness of the results leads me to confidently conclude this is correct.",

  "ground_truth": "In the hour that Jack drives 40 mph, he covers 40 miles.  In the hour that he drives 50 miles per hour, he covers 50 miles.  Therefore, he covers 90 miles in 2 hours, so his average speed is $90/2 = \\boxed{45\\text{ mph}}$.  Make sure you see the difference between this and the question, `Jack drives 40 mph for a distance of 100 miles, then 50 mph for a distance of 100 miles.  What is his average speed for the whole trip?'"
