    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by really thinking through every part.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWe're looking at the expression \\(\\frac{x-3}{x^2-10x+16}\\). The question asks us for the sum of all values of \\(x\\) where this expression is undefined. Right off the bat, I recognize that rational expressions become undefined when their denominators are equal to zero. So that's my focus here - finding out when \\(x^2 - 10x + 16 = 0\\).\n\n**Identifying the Denominator:**\n\n1. **Focus on the Denominator:** The expression will be undefined for values of \\(x\\) that make the denominator zero. So I need to solve the equation:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 10x + 16 = 0\n   \\]\n\n**Checking for a Strategy:**\n\n2. **Factoring Approach:** My first thought is to try factoring. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 16 and add up to -10. \n\n3. **Recap Factoring Emotions:** Hmm... Numbers that multiply to 16 include (1, 16), (2, 8), and (4, 4) with various signs. Let's try combinations:\n   - For \\((2, 8)\\): These add to 10, not -10, so maybe \\(-2\\) and \\(-8\\).\n\n   Ah, \\((-2)\\) and \\((-8)\\) multiply to 16 and add to -10. Perfect, I can factor the quadratic:\n   \\[\n   (x - 2)(x - 8) = 0\n   \\]\n\n**Solving the Factored Equation:**\n\n4. **Verify and Solve:** So setting each factor equal to zero gives us the values:\n   \\[\n   x - 2 = 0 \\implies x = 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x - 8 = 0 \\implies x = 8\n   \\]\n\nThese are the values that make the denominator zero, so they're the ones where the expression is undefined.\n\n**Sum of the Values:**\n\n5. **Sum Calculation:** Now, the final step is to find the sum of the valid \\(x\\) values making the expression undefined, which are \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 8\\):\n   \\[\n   2 + 8 = 10\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection**: Let's recap - I identified the need to make the denominator zero, tried factoring, and succeeded in solving for \\(x\\). My calculations for \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 8\\) leading to a sum of 10 seem reasonable. The work checks out.\n\nEverything seems consistent. If the factoring approach didn't work, I would've had options like the quadratic formula or another inspection strategy, but here it's aptly solved by factoring.\n\nThe answer to the problem, the sum of all values of \\(x\\) for which \\(\\frac{x-3}{x^2-10x+16}\\) is undefined, is **10**.",

  "ground_truth": "The given expression is undefined when the denominator equals zero. This occurs when $x^2-10x+16=0$. We use the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ is given by $-b/a$, so we see that the sum of the solutions to this equation must be $-(-10)/1=\\boxed{10}$."
