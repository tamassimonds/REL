    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem step by step and think through it like I would if I were solving it for myself.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's look carefully at the diagram and the given information. We're dealing with a triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) where there's a point \\( D \\) on the segment \\( BC \\). The length of \\( DC \\) is twice that of \\( BD \\). We need to find the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nMy first reaction is to sketch the setup and annotate everything. Visualizing is often a good start to understanding geometric problems. \n\n1. \\( D \\) is on \\( BC \\).\n2. \\( DC = 2 \\times BD \\).\n\nThis is telling me that if \\( BD = x \\), then \\( DC = 2x \\). Thus, the total length \\( BC = BD + DC = x + 2x = 3x \\).\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Area Calculation**: Typically the area of a triangle is found using \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\). We should identify the base and height.\n2. **Explore Coordinates**: We may apply coordinate geometry if we choose the locations \\( B = (-3, 0) \\) and \\( D = (0, 0) \\) assuming the x-axis is \\( BC \\).\n3. **Reflect on Simpler Geometries**: Split the problem into smaller, more familiar parts.\n\n### Calculating the Area\n\nLet's use the area approach:\n\n1. **Base of the Triangle**: Since \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) are on the line \\( BC \\), the natural choice for the base is \\( BC \\). We just found it to be \\( 3x \\).\n2. **Height**: The height from \\( A \\) to line \\( BC \\) is given explicitly as \\( AD = 4 \\) (as \\( A = (0, 4) \\)).\n\nNow we apply the formula for the area of the triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3x \\times 4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 6x\n\\]\n\nWe need \\( x \\) to further compute the area.\n\n### Checking the Work\n\nLet's reflect on each step:\n\n- It makes sense that \\( BD = x \\) and \\( DC = 2x \\), combining for \\( BC = 3x \\).\n  \n- The selected base and height are typical choices in right triangles for simplicity.\n\n### Verifying Lengths\n\nNow, check if \\( x \\) can be derived from other information. Knowing:\n- \\( BD = x = 3 \\) (from the label next to \\( B \\) to \\( D \\) on the diagram).\n\nThus, choosing:\n\n\\[ x = 3 \\]\n\nSubstitute back into our area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 6 \\times 3 = 18\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter these considerations and computations, I determine that the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is \\( \\boxed{18} \\). The steps made sense, checking back correct application of the formula and strategically chosen base and height confirms the answer is sensible.\n\nIn this problem, however, the provided setup was direct enough that we didn\u2019t encounter any roadblocks needing different approaches, though verifying details helped ensure confidence in reasonably simple geometry.",
