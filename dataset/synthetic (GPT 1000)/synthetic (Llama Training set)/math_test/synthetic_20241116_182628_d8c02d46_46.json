    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step-by-step.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** \n   - We have two numbers whose sum is 12.\n   - Their product is 35.\n   - We are trying to find the positive difference between these two numbers.\n\n2. **Reflecting on Similar Problems:** \n   - This reminds me of systems of equations, since we have two conditions (sum and product).\n   - We might also solve it by thinking about quadratic equations, as the problem structure is quite familiar from algebra.\n\n3. **Potential Methodologies:**\n   - Directly guess and verify some small number pairs that add to 12.\n   - Alternatively, use algebraic methods like forming equations and solving them.\n\n**Step-by-step Exploration:**\n\n*Step 1: Setup Equations*\n\n- I\u2019ll start by letting the two numbers be \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n- Given:\n  \\[ x + y = 12 \\] \n  \\[ x \\times y = 35 \\]\n\n*Step 2: Consider Methods to Solve the Equations*\n\n- **Method 1: Express y in terms of x**\n  - From the sum equation: \\( y = 12 - x \\).\n  - Substitute into product equation:\n    \\[ x(12 - x) = 35 \\]\n\n- **Method 2: Quadratic Approach**\n  - Rearrange to form a quadratic:\n    \\[ x^2 - 12x + 35 = 0 \\]\n\n  - Aha! That looks like something that can be factored or solved using the quadratic formula.\n\n*Step 3: Solve the Quadratic Equation*\n\n- **Factor the quadratic**: \n  - We are looking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add to 12. \n  - Thinking about factors of 35... Let's see: 7 and 5! Yes, those add to 12.\n\n  - Quadratic factors: \\((x - 5)(x - 7) = 0\\)\n\n- **Solve for x**:\n  - \\( x - 5 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 5 \\)\n  - \\( x - 7 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 7 \\)\n\n*Step 4: Identify the Numbers and Their Difference*\n\n- Found numbers: 5 and 7.\n- Reflecting on which method brought me here: The quadratic factoring was a similar pattern I encountered before and it really paid off.\n- Positive difference: \\( |7 - 5| = 2 \\)\n\n*Step 5: Verify*\n\n- Quick Double Check:\n  - Sum: \\( 5 + 7 = 12 \\) (Correct)\n  - Product: \\( 5 \\times 7 = 35 \\) (Correct)\n  - Everything checks out.\n\n*Conclusion:*\n\nThe positive difference between the numbers is 2.\n\nThat was quite the journey! I explored through setting up equations, factored a quadratic, and excitedly watched all the numbers fit snugly into place. The consistency checks reassured me along the way, allowing a confident and satisfying conclusion.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ and $y$ be the two numbers.  We are given  \\begin{align*}\nx+y&=12\\text{, and} \\\\\nxy&=35.\n\\end{align*} Solving the first equation for $y$ and substituting into the second equation, we find $x(12-x)=35$.  Subtracting the left-hand side from both sides of the equation and distributing, we find $0=x^2-12x+35$.  We can factor the right-hand side as $(x-7)(x-5)$, so the solutions are $x=7$ and $x=5$.  Substituting either of these back into $y=12-x$, we find that the two numbers are $7$ and $5$, and their difference is $\\boxed{2}$."
