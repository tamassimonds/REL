    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem and think it through step by step.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I see the problem \"Find 4 divided by \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\),\" my first thought is, \"This reminds me of dividing fractions, which I learned a while back.\" I recall a specific rule about dividing fractions: to divide by a fraction, you multiply by its reciprocal.\n\nBut before I start solving, I want to make sure I've got a good understanding of this idea. Double-checking:\n\nThe reciprocal of a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) is \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\). So, by dividing by a fraction, I can multiply by its reciprocal.\n\n**Brainstorming Solutions:**\n\n1. **Think about rewriting the problem:** I should turn 4 into a fraction because it will help me later. So, 4 becomes \\(\\frac{4}{1}\\).\n\n   Now the problem is: \\(\\frac{4}{1} \\div \\frac{4}{9}\\).\n\n2. **Apply the reciprocal rule:** Instead of dividing by \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\), I should multiply by its reciprocal, which is \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\).\n\n   The problem now becomes: \\(\\frac{4}{1} \\times \\frac{9}{4}\\).\n\n3. **Perform the multiplication:** When multiplying fractions, I multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.\n\n   Numerator calculation: \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\).\n\n   Denominator calculation: \\(1 \\times 4 = 4\\).\n\n   So, \\(\\frac{4}{1} \\times \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{36}{4}\\).\n\n**Reflect and Simplify:**\n\nWait a moment, I should simplify \\(\\frac{36}{4}\\). I think, \"36 divided by 4... Oh, right! That's a straightforward division.\"\n\n36 divided by 4 is 9. So, \\(\\frac{36}{4} = 9\\).\n\n**Check My Work:**\n\nLet me quickly run through my steps to make sure nothing is off:\n\n1. Rewrote 4 as \\(\\frac{4}{1}\\).\n2. Multiplied by the reciprocal, \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\).\n3. Multiplied the numerators and denominators: \\(\\frac{36}{4}\\).\n4. Simplified \\(\\frac{36}{4}\\) to get 9.\n\nEverything seems sound! So, the result of dividing 4 by \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\) is 9.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAh, it's always a relief when things neatly tie up. This whole process of multiplying by the reciprocal really simplifies what initially looked a bit confusing. It feels correct, and I'm confident about the solution: 9.",

  "ground_truth": "Since division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, $4 \\div \\frac{4}{9} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{4\\cdot 9}{4} = \\frac{4}{4} \\cdot 9 = 1\\cdot 9 = \\boxed{9}$."
