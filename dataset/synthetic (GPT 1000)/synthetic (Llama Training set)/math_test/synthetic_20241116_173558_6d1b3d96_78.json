    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n### First Thoughts\n1. **Graph Analysis**:\n   - The graph of a rational function \\(\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\) is shown, and we have a horizontal asymptote at \\(y=0\\). This tells us that the degree of \\(p(x)\\) must be less than the degree of \\(q(x)\\) for the asymptote to be at zero.\n   - Since \\(q(x)\\) is quadratic, let's say \\(q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\\). This suggests \\(p(x)\\) is likely linear or a constant.\n\n2. **Given Conditions**:\n   - \\(p(2) = 2\\): This gives us a specific value of the function at \\(x=2\\).\n   - \\(q(-1) = 18\\): This gives us another specific condition to work with for \\(q(x)\\).\n\n3. **Information from the Graph**:\n   - There seems to be a vertical asymptote at \\(x=2\\) and possibly another at \\(x=1\\), given the placement of the vertical line and the circle on the x-axis that's not filled (possibly indicating a hole).\n\n### Strategy Exploration\n- **Check the Asymptote Locations**:\n  - If there's a vertical asymptote at \\(x=2\\), then \\(q(x)\\) likely has a factor of \\((x-2)\\).\n  - If there\u2019s a hole or another asymptote at \\(x=1\\), then \\(q(x)\\) might also include \\((x-1)\\) as a factor.\n- **Formulate \\(q(x)\\)**:\n  - Let\u2019s try \\(q(x) = a(x-2)(x-1)\\).\n\n### Verifying \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\) Setup\n- **Finding \\(a\\)**:\n  - We know \\(q(-1) = 18\\), so substitute \\(-1\\) into \\(q(x)\\):\n  \\[\n  q(-1) = a(-3)(-2) = 6a = 18 \\implies a = 3\n  \\]\n  - So, \\(q(x) = 3(x-2)(x-1)\\).\n\n- **Develop \\(p(x)\\)**:\n  - \\(p(x)\\) should be designed so that when \\(x = 2\\), it equals 2. Since there\u2019s a vertical asymptote at \\(x=2\\), \\(p(x)\\) shouldn't contain \\(x-2\\) for cancellations, meaning it\u2019s independent of \\(x-2\\).\n  - The hole at \\(x=1\\) suggests \\(p(x)\\) might include a factor to cancel the \\((x-1)\\) from \\(q(x)\\). This could be \\((x-1)\\) itself. However, since \\(p(2) = 2\\), we might need a coefficient.\n\n### Solve for the Coefficient in \\(p(x)\\)\n- Assume \\(p(x) = k(x-1)\\). Using \\(p(2) = 2\\):\n  \\[\n  p(2) = k(2-1) = k = 2\n  \\]\n- Therefore, \\(p(x) = 2(x-1)\\).\n\n### Combine \\(p(x)\\) and \\(q(x)\\)\n- Recall \\(q(x) = 3(x-2)(x-1)\\).\n\\[\np(x) + q(x) = 2(x-1) + 3(x-2)(x-1)\n\\]\n- Expand \\(q(x)\\):\n  \\[\n  q(x) = 3(x-2)(x-1) = 3(x^2 - 3x + 2) = 3x^2 - 9x + 6\n  \\]\n- Expand \\(p(x)\\):\n  \\[\n  2(x-1) = 2x - 2\n  \\]\n- Combine both expressions:\n  \\[\n  p(x) + q(x) = (2x - 2) + (3x^2 - 9x + 6) = 3x^2 - 7x + 4\n  \\]\n\n### Final Verification\nReflect upon the graph and conditions: We identified the correct factors for the vertical asymptotes and used given point values to adjust parameters accurately. The expression for \\(p(x) + q(x)\\) seems consistent with the setup and known conditions.\n\nThus, the final answer for \\(p(x) + q(x)\\) is:\n\\[\n3x^2 - 7x + 4\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "The graph has a horizontal asymptote $y = 0,$ a hole at $x=1$, and a vertical asymptote at $x=2$. Since $q(x)$ is a quadratic, and we have a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0,$ $p(x)$ must be linear (have degree 1).\n\nSince we have a hole at $x=1$, there must be a factor of $x-1$ in both $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. Lastly, since there is a vertical asymptote at $x=2$, the denominator $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x-2$. Since $q(x)$ is quadratic, we know that $q(x) = b(x-1)(x-2)$ for some $b.$ It follows that $p(x) = a(x-1),$ for some constant $a.$ Since $p(2) = 2$, we have $a(2-1) = 2$ and $a=2.$ Since $q(-1) = 18,$ we have $b(-1-1)(-1-2) = 18$ and hence $b=3.$\n\nSo $p(x) = 2(x - 1) = 2x - 2$ and $q(x) = 3(x - 1)(x - 2) = 3x^2 - 9x + 6,$ so $p(x) + q(x) = \\boxed{3x^2 - 7x + 4}.$"
