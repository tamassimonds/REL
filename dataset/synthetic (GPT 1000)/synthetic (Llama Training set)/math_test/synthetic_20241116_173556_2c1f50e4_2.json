    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with a rational function \\(\\frac{3x^3-x^2-10x}{q(x)}\\), and the problem asks us to determine what \\(q(x)\\) is under certain conditions. At first glance, this reminds me of other rational function problems where you need to find factors for the numerator and denominator so that the function behaves in a specific way.\n\nHmm, what do we know here? We'll need a hole at \\(x = 2\\) and a vertical asymptote at \\(x = -1\\). That means both of these values should be roots of \\(q(x)\\). Also, the fact there's no horizontal asymptote is telling us something about the degree of the numerator and the denominator.\n\nLet's try to dissect each of these conditions:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Consider the Hole at \\(x = 2\\):**\n   - A hole at \\(x = 2\\) means that both the numerator and denominator must have \\((x-2)\\) as a factor, so when we simplify them, there remains no zero at \\(x = 2\\). \n   - Check: The polynomial numerator \\(3x^3-x^2-10x\\) needs \\((x-2)\\) as a factor. I wonder if I can factor this polynomial. Let me try plugging in \\(x = 2\\) to check if it zeros the polynomial: \n   \\[\n   3(2)^3 - (2)^2 - 10(2) = 24 - 4 - 20 = 0 \n   \\]\n   So indeed, \\((x-2)\\) is a factor of the numerator.\n\n2. **Consider the Vertical Asymptote at \\(x = -1\\):**\n   - A vertical asymptote at \\(x = -1\\) means that \\((x+1)\\) is a factor of the denominator \\(q(x)\\) but not of the numerator.\n   - Let me confirm that \\((x+1)\\) is not a factor of the numerator: \n   - Plugging in \\(x = -1\\) into the numerator gives:\n   \\[\n   3(-1)^3 - (-1)^2 - 10(-1) = -3 - 1 + 10 = 6 \\neq 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\((x+1)\\) is not a factor of the numerator, confirming the vertical asymptote.\n\n3. **No Horizontal Asymptote:**\n   - The absence of a horizontal asymptote suggests the degree of the numerator must be greater than the denominator (since otherwise we'd have one if the degrees were equal or a horizontal line if the denominator degree were greater).\n   - The numerator is degree 3, so perhaps \\(q(x)\\) is degree 2.\n\n4. **Constructing \\(q(x)\\):**\n   - Based on the above, \\(q(x)\\) must have \\((x-2)\\) and \\((x+1)\\) as factors. Consequently, we can express \\(q(x)\\) as:\n   \\[\n   q(x) = a(x-2)(x+1)\n   \\]\n   where \\(a\\) is a constant.\n\n5. **Using \\(q(1) = -6\\):**\n   - Now to find \\(a\\), use \\(q(1) = -6\\):\n   \\[\n   q(1) = a(1-2)(1+1) = a(-1)(2) = -2a\n   \\]\n   So, \\(-2a = -6\\) meaning \\(a = 3\\).\n\n6. **Final Form of \\(q(x)\\):**\n   - Therefore, the function \\(q(x)\\) is:\n   \\[\n   q(x) = 3(x-2)(x+1)\n   \\]\n\nLet's do a quick check:\n\n- **Does \\(x = 2\\) provide a hole?** Yes, \\(3(x-2)\\) cancels in the numerator.\n- **Does \\(x = -1\\) provide a vertical asymptote?** Yes, it zeros \\(q(x)\\) while not affecting the numerator.\n- **Is there no horizontal asymptote?** Yes, the degree of the numerator (3) is greater than the degree of \\(q(x)\\) (2).\n\nIt's all falling into place neatly! I feel confident this solution is correct.",

  "ground_truth": "Factorising the numerator gives us\n$$\\frac{3x^3-x^2-10x}{q(x)} = \\frac{x(x-2)(3x+5)}{q(x)}.$$There will only be a hole at $x=2$ if both the numerator and denominator are $0$ when $x=2$. We can see that this is already true for the numerator, hence $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x-2$.\n\nSince there is a vertical asymptote at $x=-1$, $q(-1) = 0$. By the Factor theorem, $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x+1$.\n\nSince there is no horizontal asymptote, we know that the degree of $q(x)$ must be less than the degree of the numerator. The numerator has a degree of $3$, which means that $q(x)$ has degree at most $2$.\n\nPutting all of this together, we have that $q(x) = a(x-2)(x+1)$ for some constant $a$. Since $q(1) = -6$, we have $a(1-2)(1+1) = -6$. which we can solve to get $a = 3$.  Hence, $q(x) = \\boxed{3(x-2)(x+1)} = 3x^2-3x-6$."
