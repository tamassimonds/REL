    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it step by step, keeping in mind all the varied approaches, reflections, and checks that make problem-solving a human process.\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so this problem is asking us to do something with line segments and midpoints. At first glance, it looks like we need to find the midpoints of two different line segments and then find the midpoint of a new segment created by those midpoints. \n\nSegments with endpoints discussed here: \\( s_1 \\) and \\( s_2 \\). With endpoints given, the keyword here is midpoint. Alright, I'm initially thinking, \"midpoint formula!\" I remember that the midpoint of a segment with endpoints at \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is:\n\n\\[\nM = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, let's apply this to the segments \\( s_1 \\) and \\( s_2 \\).\n\n### **Application on \\( s_1 \\):**\n\nFor \\( s_1 \\), we have endpoints \\((3+\\sqrt{2}, 5)\\) and \\((4, 7)\\).\nUsing the midpoint formula:\n\n- The \\(x\\)-coordinate of the midpoint of \\( s_1 \\) would be:\n  \\[\n  x_1 = \\frac{(3+\\sqrt{2}) + 4}{2} = \\frac{7+\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- The \\(y\\)-coordinate of the midpoint of \\( s_1 \\) would be:\n  \\[\n  y_1 = \\frac{5 + 7}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n  \\]\n\nSo the midpoint \\( M_1 \\) of \\( s_1 \\) is: \\(\\left(\\frac{7+\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 6\\right)\\).\n\n### **Check:**\n\nWait\u2014did all this math check out? My gut says yes, but let's just run the arithmetic real quick on the \\(x\\)-coordinate, seemed a bit off\u2014is the division by 2 making sense? Okay, good, nothing too alarming here. Let's keep moving.\n\n### **Application on \\( s_2 \\):**\n\nFor \\( s_2 \\), endpoints \\((6-\\sqrt{2}, 3)\\) and \\((3, 5)\\).\n\n- The \\(x\\)-coordinate of the midpoint of \\( s_2 \\) would be:\n  \\[\n  x_2 = \\frac{(6-\\sqrt{2}) + 3}{2} = \\frac{9-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- The \\(y\\)-coordinate of the midpoint of \\( s_2 \\) would be:\n  \\[\n  y_2 = \\frac{3 + 5}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n  \\]\n\nSo, the midpoint \\( M_2 \\) of \\( s_2 \\) is: \\(\\left(\\frac{9-\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 4\\right)\\).\n\n### **Reflect and Check:**\n\nDoes everything look okay so far? Okay, doing quick mental checks tells me nothing looks funky or notably off on these numbers. Let's push forward.\n\n### **Finding the Midpoint of the New Segment:**\n\nNow we\u2019re asked to find the midpoint of a segment with endpoints at the midpoints \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_2 \\).\n\nMidpoints \\( M_1 = \\left(\\frac{7+\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 6\\right) \\) and \\( M_2 = \\left(\\frac{9-\\sqrt{2}}{2}, 4\\right) \\).\n\n- Calculate the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the final midpoint:\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{7+\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{9-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)}{2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{16}{2}\\right)}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n  \\]\n\n- Calculate the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the final midpoint:\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{6 + 4}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n  \\]\n\n### **Final Check and Thoughts:**\n\nSo this points us to the final answer being \\((4, 5)\\).\n\nQuickly scanning the process: yep, all calculations look consistent and logical. I initially worried I might mix up some midpoint conversion with radicals involved, but it reaffirmed itself through the checks.\n\nTherefore, the midpoint of the segment with endpoints at the midpoints of \\( s_1 \\) and \\( s_2 \\) is \\((4, 5)\\).\n\nGlad that all cleared up!",
