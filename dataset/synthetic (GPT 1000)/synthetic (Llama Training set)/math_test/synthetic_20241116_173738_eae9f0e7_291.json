    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think about it together.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The problem involves rolling two 6-sided dice, specifically a red die and a green die. Instant reaction: Rolling dice usually involves considering probabilities of certain outcomes, and since these are typical 6-sided dice, each side has an equal chance of landing face up.\n\n- We need the red die to show a 2 and the green die to show a 5. This seems straightforward - but let's make sure we cover the basics before jumping to conclusions.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Individual Probabilities:**\n   - Consider each die separately. Probability principles will likely apply individually before combining.\n   - Red die needs a 2: Since there are 6 sides, each side (or number) on the die has a probability of 1/6.\n\n2. **Combined Probabilities:**\n   - For both dice to show specific numbers, I think I need to multiply the probabilities of each die showing the desired outcome.\n   - Green die needs a 5: Similar situation with the red die, probability is also 1/6.\n\n**Putting It Together:**\n\n- **Probability of Red Die Equals 2:** 1/6\n- **Probability of Green Die Equals 5:** 1/6\n\n- I remember from previous probability problems that when you want two independent events to occur together (like the outcome of two different dice), you multiply their individual probabilities. This might be key.\n\n- Let\u2019s calculate it:\n\n  \\[ \\text{Probability (Red = 2 and Green = 5)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{36} \\]\n\n- This result, \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\), seems reasonable. Each unique pair of die outcomes (like '<red, green> = <2, 5>') should have an equal chance when considering independent six-sided dice.\n\n**Reflection and Quick Checks:**\n\n- Is \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\) reasonable? Well, for two dice, I remember that there are \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) possible unique outcomes because each die is independent.\n- And, since each pair (like (2,5)) should have an equal likelihood, 1 out of these 36 different combinations sounds logical.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**\n\n- Re-imagining the dice roll: If rolling the dice were like flipping a two-headed coin where each face is equally probable, outcomes like (2, 5) should just be 1 out of many combinations.\n\n- I questioned myself whether I remembered the probability multiplication rule correctly. Reassuringly, for independent events, multiplying the probabilities is indeed the right step.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- We verified the steps and calculation. Returning to the original goal: the probability that the red die shows a 2 and the green die shows a 5 is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\).\n\nThere we go! I've walked through this and I think we've reasoned through every part to get the answer. If I need to explain it to someone else or decide the next step, it's clear and grounded in probability concepts.",

  "ground_truth": "We solve this problem by counting outcomes.  There is only 1 successful outcome: a red 2 and a green 5.  Rolling each die is an independent event, so we multiply the 6 possible outcomes for the red die by the 6 possible outcomes for the green die, to get 36 total outcomes.  Hence the desired probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{36}}$."
