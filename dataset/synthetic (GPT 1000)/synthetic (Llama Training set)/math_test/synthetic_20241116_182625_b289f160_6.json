    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about finding the smallest of five consecutive integers with a given mean of 21. Here we go, step by step:\n\n**First Thoughts and Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** The problem asks for the smallest integer among five consecutive numbers whose average is 21. These are integers like \\( n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4 \\), because consecutive integers differ by 1. \n\n2. **Initial Approach:** The mean is the total sum divided by the number of integers, which is 5 here. So, I'm thinking if I set up an equation for their sum and solve for \\( n \\), I can figure out what the smallest integer is.\n\n3. **Equation Setup:** The sum of these five numbers is \\( n + (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) + (n+4) \\). It simplifies to \\( 5n + 10 \\). Setting up the mean:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mean} = \\frac{5n + 10}{5} = 21\n   \\]\n\n**Breaking it Down:**\n\n4. **Solving the Equation:** This equation simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   5n + 10 = 105\n   \\]\n   Here, I multiplied both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction.\n\n5. **Isolating \\( n \\):** Now, subtract 10 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   5n = 95\n   \\]\n\n6. **Finding \\( n \\):** Dividing by 5 gives:\n   \\[\n   n = 19\n   \\]\n\n   So, my solution tells me that the smallest integer is 19.\n\n**Reflection and Double-Check:**\n\n7. **Checking Calculations:**\n   - Sum of integers: \\( 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 \\). Their sum would be: \\( 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 = 105 \\).\n   - Calculating the mean: \\( 105 \\div 5 = 21 \\). \n\n   This checks out because it gives us the mean we were expecting.\n\n8. **Double-Check Strategy:** \n   - I remember the sum of an arithmetic sequence (simple in case of consecutive integers) is \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term}) \\). Here \\( n = 5 \\) and first term = 19, last term = 23. This gives: \\(\\frac{5}{2} \\times (19 + 23) = 105\\).\n\n   The pathways of working this problem both lead consistently to the smallest integer being 19, confirming our conclusions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe smallest of the five consecutive integers whose mean is 21 is indeed **19**. The approach seems sound, calculations match the logic of consecutive integers, and everything checks out. This reflects a clear and correct solution path.",

  "ground_truth": "The mean of five consecutive integers is equal to the number in the middle. Since the numbers have a mean of $21,$ if we were to distribute the quantities equally, we would have $21,$ $21,$ $21,$ $21,$ and $21.$ Since the numbers are consecutive, the second number is $1$ less than the $21$ in the middle, while the fourth number is $1$ more than the $21$ in the middle. Similarly, the first number is $2$ less than the $21$ in the middle, while the fifth number is $2$ more than the $21$ in the middle.\n\nThus, the numbers are $21-2,$ $21-1,$ $21,$ $21+1,$ $21+2.$ The smallest of $5$ consecutive integers having a mean of $21,$ is $\\boxed{19}.$"
