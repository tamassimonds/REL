    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by breaking it down step-by-step. The question at hand is: What is the value of 123123 divided by 1001?\n\n### Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\n1. **Initial Impression**:\n   - Okay, so we need to divide a six-digit number, 123123, by a three-digit number, 1001. A part of me recognizes the pattern in 123123. It looks like a repetitive sequence which might simplify things somehow, though I'm not yet sure how.\n\n2. **Potential Strategies**:\n   - Direct division and see what quotient emerges.\n   - Recognize any patterns in numbers, like repeating sequences, that may simplify the calculation.\n   - Consider factors of the divisor 1001 that might offer a simplification.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n3. **Direct Division**:\n   - I could try dividing 123123 by 1001 directly using long division. This is the most straightforward approach.\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - The number 123123 might be constructed in a way that pairs with 1001 neatly. This resembles something I've seen where numbers like 123123 can be expressed in a repeating pattern that matches certain divisors.\n\n5. **Factorization Insight**:\n   - I remember that 1001 can be decomposed into 7 * 11 * 13. Maybe I could explore how these smaller factors interact with 123123. \n\n### Calculation\n\n6. **Exploring Factorization**:\n   - Let's start here. If 1001 = 7 * 11 * 13, what if I apply this to 123123?\n   - Let's check if 123123 is divisible by these smaller components of 1001.\n\n7. **Step-by-Step Checking**:\n   - **Divisibility by 7**:\n     - Usually, I would check divisibility rules. The sum method for 7 isn't straightforward here, so a rough division: \\( 123123 \\div 7 \\).\n     - Calculation: \\( 123123 \\div 7 = 17589 \\) (no remainder).\n\n   - **Divisibility by 11**:\n     - Divisibility rule for 11 involves checking the alternating sum of digits: \\( (1 - 2 + 3 - 1 + 2 - 3 = 0) \\).\n     - Since the alternating sum is 0, 123123 is divisible by 11.\n\n   - **Divisibility by 13**:\n     - Another direct check: \\( 17589 \\div 13 = 1353 \\) (no remainder).\n\n### Reflection and Conclusion\n\n8. **Bringing it Together**:\n   - So, since 123123 is divisible sequentially by 7, 11, and 13, it confirms full divisibility by 1001. Quick reflection suggested this factorization approach was more efficient than a lengthy direct division due to the recognizably constructed nature of 123123.\n\n9. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, \\( \\frac{123123}{1001} = 123 \\).\n\nThis strategy makes sense, and everything checks out after going through potential dead ends and ultimately settling on the factorization insight. My \"aha moment\" was realizing 123123's synchronized divisibility with 1001\u2019s factors mirrors the pattern inherent in these numbers, simplifying the process significantly.",

  "ground_truth": "Notice that the first number can be written as $123\\cdot1000 + 123 = 123(1001)$. Thus, when this number is divided by 1001, the quotient is $\\boxed{123}$."
