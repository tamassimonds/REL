    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving the problem: finding the product of the two integer values for \\( x \\) for which \\( |x^2 - 16| \\) is a prime number.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\nThis problem seems to involve some understanding of how absolute values affect equations, specifically how small changes in \\( x \\) can affect \\( x^2 \\) and therefore the entire expression. This reminds me of similar problems where you check individual conditions to find possible values.\n\n### Explore Different Strategies\n\n1. **Understand the Expression:** \n   - We have \\( |x^2 - 16| \\). This expression can have two cases:\n     1. \\( x^2 - 16 \\)\n     2. \\( 16 - x^2 \\)\n\n2. **Think about Values of \\( x^2 \\):**\n   - If \\( x^2 = 16 \\), then \\( |x^2 - 16| = 0 \\), which is not prime. However, small deviations from this value might work.\n\n3. **Consider Small Values Around 16:**\n   - If \\( x^2 > 16 \\), then \\( x^2 - 16 \\) should be prime.\n   - If \\( x^2 < 16 \\), then \\( 16 - x^2 \\) should be prime.\n\n4. **Test Small Integer Values for \\( x \\):**\n   - Start testing \\( x \\) around the square roots of 16, since that's where \\( x^2 \\) changes significantly:\n     - Check \\( x = 4 \\) (perfect square root of 16)\n     - Check nearby integer values: \\( x = 3, 5, -3, -5 \\)\n     \n### Reflections and Adjustments\n\n- Let's test the values and compute the actual results:\n\n### Specific Calculations\n\n1. **Test \\( x = 3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 16 = 3^2 - 16 = 9 - 16 = -7\n   \\]\n   - \\( |-7| = 7 \\), which is prime. So, \\( x = 3 \\) is a solution.\n\n2. **Test \\( x = 5 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 16 = 5^2 - 16 = 25 - 16 = 9\n   \\]\n   - 9 is not prime. Thus, \\( x = 5 \\) is not a solution.\n\n3. **Test \\( x = -3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 16 = (-3)^2 - 16 = 9 - 16 = -7\n   \\]\n   - \\( |-7| = 7 \\) is prime. Thus, \\( x = -3 \\) is another solution.\n\n4. **Test \\( x = -5 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 16 = (-5)^2 - 16 = 25 - 16 = 9\n   \\]\n   - 9 is not prime. Thus, \\( x = -5 \\) is not a solution.\n\n### Verification and Conclusion\n\n- The integer solutions for \\( x \\) that meet the criteria are \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\).\n\n- **Calculate the Product:**\n  - The problem asks for the product of these values: \n  \\[\n  3 \\times (-3) = -9\n  \\]\n\nThis approach has been thorough through testing small values around the point of interest. Each logical step checked out. Our final answer is \\(-9\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The absolute value of the product of two numbers is the product of their absolute values, so we can write  \\[\n|x^2-16|=|(x+4)(x-4)|=|x+4|\\,|x-4|.\n\\]Since $|x^2-16|$ is written as the product of two positive integers, it is composite unless one of the integers is $1$.  Solving $|x+4|=1$, we observe that either $x+4=1$ or $x+4=-1$, which give solutions of $x=-3$ and $x=-5$.  Similarly, solving $|x-4|=1$ we find $x=3$ or $x=5$. Among the possible solutions $\\{-5,-3,3,5\\}$, only $\\{-3,3\\}$ yield a prime value for $|x+4|\\,|x-4|$.  Therefore, the product of the integer values of $x$ for which $|x^2-16|$ is a prime number is $\\boxed{-9}$."
