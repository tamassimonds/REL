    "working_out": "Let's dive into the problem by first understanding exactly what it is asking:\n\nThe problem is asking us to find the number of integer solutions \\(x\\) for the inequality \\(-2 < 4 + 3x < 2\\).\n\nFirst thought: At its core, this seems like a compound inequality problem where \\(4 + 3x\\) is sandwiched between \\(-2\\) and \\(2\\). This suggests two simpler inequalities that we can potentially solve separately. Let's explore this and see how it goes.\n\nStep 1: Split the compound inequality into two separate inequalities.\n\n1. Solve \\(-2 < 4 + 3x\\)\n   \n2. Solve \\(4 + 3x < 2\\)\n\nSo, it seems like solving these independently might help us find a range for \\(x\\).\n\nStep 2: Solve the first inequality \\(-2 < 4 + 3x\\).\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-2 - 4 < 3x \\implies -6 < 3x\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\n-2 < x\n\\]\n\nOkay, so from the first part, \\(x\\) must be greater than \\(-2\\). \n\nStep 3: Solve the second inequality \\(4 + 3x < 2\\).\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n3x < 2 - 4 \\implies 3x < -2\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nx < -\\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nCombine these results: From Step 2, we have \\(-2 < x\\), and from Step 3, we have \\(x < -\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nStep 4: Determine the integer values of \\(x\\) that lie in the interval \\(-2 < x < -\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nReflecting on this, \\(x\\) must be an integer greater than \\(-2\\) and less than \\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\). The integer immediately greater than \\(-2\\) is \\(-1\\). \n\nChecking \\(-1\\), it fits within \\(-2 < x < -\\frac{2}{3}\\). No other integers will satisfy this because \\(-1\\) is the only integer in this range.\n\nStep 5: Double-check the results:\n\nIs \\(-1\\) indeed greater than \\(-2\\)? Yes.\n\nIs \\(-1\\) indeed less than \\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\)? Yes.\n\nTherefore, the only integer satisfying the inequality \\(-2 < 4 + 3x < 2\\) is \\(-1\\).\n\nFinal step: The number of integer solutions is 1.\n\nLet's mark this down:\n\nThe integer \\(x = -1\\) satisfies the inequality, and hence the solution to the problem is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The number of integers } x \\text{ that satisfy } -2 < 4 + 3x < 2 \\text{ is } \\boxed{1}.\n\\]",
