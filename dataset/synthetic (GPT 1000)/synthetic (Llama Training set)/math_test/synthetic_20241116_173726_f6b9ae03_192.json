    "working_out": "Alright, let's break down this problem step by step. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the question. We are given two triangles, $\\triangle PQR$ and $\\triangle STU$, each with an area of 1. In $\\triangle PQR$, $U$, $W$, and $V$ are the midpoints of the sides. Similarly, in $\\triangle STU$, $R$, $V$, and $W$ are the midpoints of the sides. I need to find the area of parallelogram $UVRW$.\n\n### Step 2: Sketching and Initial Thoughts\n\nLet's visualize this. \n\n- $\\triangle PQR$ has $U$, $W$, and $V$ as midpoints:\n\n  - $U$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{PQ}$\n  - $W$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{QR}$\n  - $V$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{RP}$\n  \n- $\\triangle STU$ has $R$, $V$, and $W$ as midpoints:\n\n  - $R$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{ST}$\n  - $W$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{TU}$\n  - $V$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{US}$\n\n### Step 3: Exploring Strategies\n\nI have a feeling this might relate to properties of triangles where midpoints are involved, possibly due to some symmetry.\n\n- **Strategy 1: Use Midpoint Theorem**\n\n  A midpoint connected to another midpoint forms similar triangles and we can use the Midpoint Theorem. It states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel and half in length compared to the third side. \n\n- **Strategy 2: Use Areas in Relation**\n\n  Since the points $U$, $V$, and $W$ are midpoints, it might be useful to determine portions of the triangle divided by these midpoints.\n\n### Step 4: Checking Midpoint Theorem Application\n\nI'll try to apply the midpoint theories:\n\n- Since $U$, $V$, $W$ are midpoints, lines $\\overline{UV}$, $\\overline{VW}$, and $\\overline{WU}$ should be parallel to the sides not containing the corresponding midpoints. \n\nWait, let's step back for clarity\u2014drawing $\\triangle PQR$, connecting midpoints creates 4 smaller triangles within $PQR$. So these smaller triangles should each have 1/4 of the area of $\\triangle PQR$ due to symmetry and properties of midpoints.\n\n### Step 5: Visualizing Symmetry and Area Proportionality\n\n- **Inside $\\triangle PQR$: Triangle Areas**\n\n  If the above connection is right, then triangle $PUW$, $QUW$, $RVW$, and $PVU$ should each have an area of 0.25.\n\n### Step 6: Focusing on Parallelogram Area\n\nParallelogram $UVRW$ is composed of segments from some of those smaller triangles. The strategy is:\n\n- $UVRW$ covers two triangles' worth of midpoints.\n- Symmetrically, it should take the area of two of the four smaller triangles (each 0.25).\n\nSo logically considering the geometric layout and mid-section properties, the area of parallelogram $UVRW$ should actually be the area of two out of four triangles, leading to an area of \\(0.5\\).\n\n### Step 7: Final Thoughts and Verification\n\n- **Rethink Midpoints-Concurrent Lines**: Re-check based on parallel properties and segment equalities due to midpoints affecting symmetry.\n- **Agreeing on Consistency**: With equal triangles divided into equal mid-segments, continue relating geometric symmetry that ensures computational check.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on these geometric considerations and checks, the area of parallelogram $UVRW$ is \\(\\boxed{0.5}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since $V$ is the midpoint of $PR,$ then $PV=VR.$  Since $UVRW$ is a parallelogram, then $VR=UW.$ Since $W$ is the midpoint of $US,$ then $UW=WS.$\n\nThus, $$PV=VR=UW=WS.$$ Similarly, $$QW=WR=UV=VT.$$ Also, $R$ is the midpoint of $TS$ and therefore, $TR=RS.$ Thus, $\\triangle VTR$ is congruent to $\\triangle WRS$, and so the two triangles have equal area.\n\nDiagonal $VW$ in parallelogram $UVRW$ divides the area of the parallelogram in half. Therefore, $\\triangle UVW$ and $\\triangle RWV$ have equal areas.\n\nIn quadrilateral $VRSW,$ $VR=WS$ and $VR$ is parallel to $WS.$ Thus, $VRSW$ is a parallelogram and the area of $\\triangle RWV$ is equal to the area of $\\triangle WRS.$ Therefore, $\\triangle VTR,$ $\\triangle WRS,$ $\\triangle RWV,$ and $\\triangle UVW$ have equal areas, and so these four triangles divide $\\triangle STU$ into quarters.\n\nParallelogram $UVRW$ is made from two of these four quarters of $\\triangle STU,$ or one half of $\\triangle STU.$ The area of parallelogram $UVRW$ is thus half of $1,$ or $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.$"
