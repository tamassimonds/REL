    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\nOkay, I see we need to compute \\(\\dbinom{15}{2}\\). Immediately, this looks like a problem involving combinations. I've worked with combinations before in probability and counting problems, and I remember using a formula for this.\n\nFirst, let me recall the formula for combinations from my memory: \n\\[\n\\dbinom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n\\]\n\nThis is what's also known as \"n choose r,\" and it tells us how many ways we can choose \\(r\\) items from a set of \\(n\\) items without regard to order. Given that \\(n = 15\\) and \\(r = 2\\), I think this is exactly what we need to use.\n\nStrategy brainstorm:\n\n1. Use the formula directly. This seems straightforward since we already have the values of \\(n\\) and \\(r\\).\n2. Explore if there's a simpler way since calculating factorials can involve large numbers, but for \\(2\\), it might not be too complex. \n\nLet's start with applying the formula. I'll write it down step by step.\n\nCompute the necessary factorials:\n\n1. \\(15!\\) \u2013 This seems daunting initially, but I remember I only actually need parts of it. Actually, I'll only need to go as far as \\(15 \\times 14\\) because the rest cancels with \\( (n-r)! \\) which is \\(13!\\) in this case. \n\n\\[ \n15 \\times 14 = 210 \n\\]\n\n2. \\(2!\\) is straightforward, as it's just:\n\n\\[ \n2 \\times 1 = 2 \n\\]\n\nWait, I realize that the formula can sometimes seem bloated with the full factorial expression. It's not very efficient to calculate \\(15!\\) entirely just for this purpose, so it's comforting that I only needed to calculate until \\(15\\times 14\\).\n\nComputing the combination:\n\nAccording to the formula:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{15}{2} = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this calculation:\n\\[\n= \\frac{210}{2}\n= 105\n\\]\n\nQuick check:\n- The number 105 seems reasonable; it's much smaller than 15 squared (since we're only choosing 2 items, and there are far fewer pairs than total squares, 225).\n\nReflection on correctness:\n- The formula was applied correctly\u2014the cancellation in factorial terms is key to simplifying it.\n- Remembering that combinations don\u2019t consider orders helps verify that 105 gives distinct unordered pairs.\n\nRealization: \n\nUpon reflection, this looks correct because it aligns with the typical size of a combination calculation. Also, walking through each step, nothing felt off, and the smaller values for factorials eased the calculation.\n\nFinal thought: \n\nI learned that it\u2019s beneficial to not overcomplicate with full factorial calculations and instead rely on simplification where possible. The final answer is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{15}{2} = 105\n\\]",
