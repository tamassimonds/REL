    "working_out": "First, let's focus on understanding the problem.\n\n### Understanding the Problem:\n\nWe know the orchestra has 130 members. According to the problem:\n- 60% of these musicians play string instruments.\n- The remainder play woodwind, brass, or percussion instruments.\n\nOur task is to determine how many musicians do not play string instruments.\n\n### Step-by-step Approach:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of orchestra members:**\n\n   There are 130 members in total.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of musicians who play string instruments:**\n\n   We know 60% of the musicians play string instruments, so let's calculate that first.\n\n   - Using the percentage, we multiply 60% by the total number of members: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of string musicians} = 0.60 \\times 130\n     \\]\n\n   Let me calculate that real quick. I normally use a calculator for percentages, but let's do some quick mental math:\n\n   - 10% of 130 is 13.\n   - Multiply that by 6 to find 60%: \n     \\[\n     13 \\times 6 = 78\n     \\]\n\n   So, 78 musicians play string instruments.\n\n3. **Determine the remaining musicians:**\n\n   Now, we need to find out how many do not play string instruments. To do this, we subtract the number of string musicians from the total number of musicians:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of non-string musicians} = 130 - 78\n   \\]\n\n   Again, some quick math:\n\n   - Subtract 78 from 130: \n     \\[\n     130 - 78 = 52\n     \\]\n\n   So, 52 musicians do not play string instruments.\n\n### Quick Checks:\n\n- Does 60% being 78 make sense? Yes, given that 78 is around half-plus-a-little of 130, it seems right.\n- Subtracting to find non-string players: The math checks out.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe answer to the problem is that 52 musicians in the orchestra do not play string instruments. \n\nReflecting on the method: This was straightforward once the percentage calculation was laid out. The direct subtraction afterward made logical sense. Everything appears consistent, with no odd results or miscalculations.",
