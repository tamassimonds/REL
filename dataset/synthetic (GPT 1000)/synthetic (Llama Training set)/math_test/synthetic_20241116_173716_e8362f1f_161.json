    "working_out": "### First Thoughts\n\nOkay, I'm looking at a function \\( f(x) = \\frac{6x^3 + 4x^2 - 11x + 5}{3x^3 - 15x + 20} \\). This seems like a rational function, and the question asks about the horizontal asymptote, which makes me think about how these functions behave as \\( x \\) goes to infinity.\n\n#### Horizontal Asymptote\n\nFor rational functions, the horizontal asymptote is usually determined by comparing the degrees of the polynomial in the numerator and the denominator. Let's take a closer look:\n\n- **Numerator**: \\( 6x^3 + 4x^2 - 11x + 5 \\) - This is a cubic polynomial, degree 3.\n- **Denominator**: \\( 3x^3 - 15x + 20 \\) - This is also a cubic polynomial, degree 3.\n\nThe degrees are equal. When the degrees are equal, I remember that the horizontal asymptote is generally given by the ratio of the leading coefficients of the numerator and the denominator.\n\n### Exploring the Strategy\n\n1. **Identify Leading Coefficients**:\n   - Numerator leading coefficient is **6** (from \\( 6x^3 \\)).\n   - Denominator leading coefficient is **3** (from \\( 3x^3 \\)).\n\n2. **Calculate the Horizontal Asymptote**:\n   - If degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal, the horizontal asymptote is:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{\\text{leading coefficient of numerator}}{\\text{leading coefficient of denominator}} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2.\n     \\]\n\n### Check the Initial Thoughts and Calculations\n\nLet me quickly verify:\n\n- Since both polynomials are of degree 3 (the terms \\( x^3 \\) are the highest in both), my approach using the ratio of leading coefficients is the standard procedure.\n- Calculating directly: \\(\\frac{6}{3} = 2\\).\n\nOkay, this seems correct so far based on the typical behavior of rational functions.\n\n### Deeper Reflection\n\nI should briefly consider if there could be any special cases or exceptions. For example, if there were any restrictions making our normal procedure invalid. However, the function behaves typically as it goes to \\( \\pm\\infty \\), assuming no funky divisions by zero or indeterminate forms (like when both polynomials are zero at specific \\( x \\) values) at infinity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI think we've got it. For the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{6x^3 + 4x^2 - 11x + 5}{3x^3 - 15x + 20} \\), the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 2 \\).\n\nFinal answer: \\( c = 2 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "When the degree (largest exponent) of the polynomial on the numerator and denominator are the same, the horizontal asymptote approaches the ratio of the leading coefficient of the numerator to the leading coefficient of the denominator. In this case, the ratio is $\\frac{6}{3} = \\boxed{2}$."
