    "working_out": "Let's start by really digging into this problem and understanding what\u2019s being asked. \n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n\n- **Understanding the Problem**: A rubber ball is dropped from a height of 100 feet. When it hits the ground, it doesn\u2019t bounce back to the same height but to $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the height it came from. We need to calculate the total distance this ball travels until it eventually comes to rest. \n- **What\u2019s Familiar?** This resembles problems I've seen before where an object falls and rebounds, so there's a geometric pattern potentially involved with the heights or distances.\n- **What\u2019s Unclear?** I\u2019m unsure how many bounces I need to calculate and how the total distance aggregates these descents and ascents.\n\n### Strategy Brainstorm:\n\n1. **Direct Calculation of Bounces**: Maybe I calculate the distance for each bounce and see if a pattern or series emerges.\n2. **Recursive Patterns**: There might be a numeric pattern since rebound heights are consistently a fraction of the previous height, suggesting a geometric series is involved.\n3. **Visualizing as a Series**: Think of this as repeated scenarios where the ball descends and then ascends. Each subsequent ascent and descent could be the fraction of the previous.\n\n### Attempt Strategy 2: Recursive Patterns with Checks\n\n- **First Drop (Descent Only)**: 100 feet (this is straightforward since it\u2019s the starting point).\n  \n- **First Bounce (Ascent + Descent)**:\n  - **Bounce Up**: Reaches $\\frac{2}{5} \\times 100 = 40$ feet.\n  - **Falls Down from 40**: Travels another 40 feet.\n\n- **Pattern Check**:\n  - **Second Ascent**: $\\frac{2}{5} \\times 40 = 16$ feet.\n  - **Falls Down from 16**: Travels another 16 feet.\n\n- **Ok, each bounce involves an ascent and a descent, and both are equal after the initial drop. The pattern for each complete cycle after the first descent is Ascent+Descent.**\n\n### Attempt Strategy 3: Forming a Series\n\n- **Identify Pattern**:\n  - Initial drop: 100 feet.\n  - First bounce cycle (up and down): $40 + 40$ feet.\n  - Second bounce cycle: $16 + 16$ feet.\n  - Notice each ascent-descent pair is double the ascent (e.g., $2 \\times 40$, $2 \\times 16...$).\n\n- **General Pattern (Geometric Series)**:\n  - Heights decrease by $\\frac{2}{5}$ each time.\n  - Distance per bounce cycle = $2 \\times$ current ascent.\n\n### Series and Calculation:\n\n- First drop is counted as 100 feet.\n- Total distance: $100 + 2(40) + 2(16) + 2(6.4) + 2(2.56) + \u2026$\n- **This is a geometric series** with:\n  - First term, \\(a = 40\\)\n  - Common ratio, \\(r = \\frac{2}{5}\\)\n\n- **Series for bounces**: \\( S_{\\text{bounce}} = 2a/(1-r) \\)\n  - \\( S_{\\text{bounce}} = 2 \\cdot 40 / (1 - \\frac{2}{5}) = \\frac{80}{0.6} = \\frac{400}{3} \\approx 133.33\\)  feet\n\n### Final Total Distance:\n\n- Add initial drop and all bounce cycles:\n  - Total Distance = \\(100 + S_{\\text{bounce}} \\approx 100 + 133.33 = 233.33\\) feet\n\n### Checking and Reflection:\n\n- **Check Reasonableness**: Values decrease reasonably and sum up correctly in a typical geometric fashion. The initial energy loss in bounce aligns with a converging series ratio.\n- **Pattern Insight**: Confirmed through direct checks, cycle-by-cycle till we adopted a systematic approach.\n\nSo, the **total distance the ball travels until it stops bouncing is approximately 233.33 feet**. This calculation aligns with the established understanding of geometric series in physics. Each part of the solution iteratively confirmed the direction and correctness.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous response. Let's re-evaluate this problem and correct the mistake by exploring different strategies and verifying the solution.\n\n### Reevaluating the Problem:\nThe problem involves a rubber ball that initially drops from a height of 100 feet. Each time it bounces, it reaches \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) of the previous height. Our goal is to compute the total distance the ball travels.\n\n### Initial Approach Recap:\nPreviously, I attempted to solve the problem by considering the distances individually for each bounce and realizing a geometric series. However, my series calculation and summation appeared incorrect in the final steps. Let's refine the approach.\n\n### Correcting the Approach:\nFirst, let's restate the problem in terms of the problem's structure:\n- **Initial Drop (Descent)**: 100 feet\n- **Bounces (Ascents and Descents)**: After each ascent, it falls the same distance it ascended because it's a bounce. Hence, each bounce contributes twice the ascent distance.\n\n### Exploring the Series\n1. **Geometric Series for Bounces:**\n   - First ascent height after the bounce: \\(40\\) feet (from 100 feet \\(\\times \\frac{2}{5}\\))\n   - Second ascent height: \\(16\\) feet (from 40 feet \\(\\times \\frac{2}{5}\\))\n   - Third ascent height: \\(6.4\\) feet....\n\nThus, the series for the ascent and corresponding descent per bounce cycle:\n\\[\n\\text{Ascent Series} = 40, 16, 6.4, \\ldots\n\\]\nThe total distance for each bounce cycle is twice the series terms (i.e., ascent and equal descent):\n\\[\n\\text{Bounce Series Total} = 2(40 + 16 + 6.4 + \\ldots)\n\\]\n\nThis is a geometric series where:\n- First term \\(a = 40\\)\n- Common ratio \\(r = \\frac{2}{5}\\)\n\n2. **Sum of the Series:**\nThe sum \\(S\\) of the infinite geometric series \\(a, ar, ar^2, \\ldots\\) is given by:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\n\\]\nFor our bounce series:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{40}{1 - \\frac{2}{5}} = \\frac{40}{\\frac{3}{5}} = \\frac{40 \\times 5}{3} = \\frac{200}{3}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance of these bounces (considering each ascent and descent) is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Bounce Distance} = 2 \\times \\frac{200}{3} = \\frac{400}{3}\n\\]\n\n3. **Final Total Distance:**\nAdding the initial drop:\n- Initial drop = 100 feet\n- Total bounces = \\(\\frac{400}{3}\\) feet\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = 100 + \\frac{400}{3} = \\frac{300}{3} + \\frac{400}{3} = \\frac{700}{3} \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nUpon reviewing the approach, ensuring a clear understanding of the geometric series, and performing precise calculations, the total distance the ball travels, after accounting for all ascents and descents, is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{700}{3}}\\) feet. This aligned solution correctly integrates the initial drop and infinite series based on the problem's context.",
