    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n  \nWhen I first see this problem, \\(102^2 - 98^2\\), it looks a bit familiar. It reminds me of something I've seen before with squared terms. This looks like a difference of squares problem.\n\nBrainstorming Possible Strategies:\n\n- One way is to directly calculate \\(102^2\\) and \\(98^2\\) and then find the difference. This seems straightforward, but it might involve larger calculations than necessary.\n- Another way is to recognize this as a difference of squares situation. The formula for that is \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)\\). Using this identity might simplify the problem.\n\nBefore choosing a strategy, let me consider the practicality and complexity. The difference of squares formula seems very appealing because it\u2019ll involve smaller numbers.\n\nCalculating Based on the Difference of Squares:\n\n1. Recognize the formula: \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)\\).\n2. Set \\(a = 102\\) and \\(b = 98\\).\n3. Compute \\(a-b\\): \n   \\[\n   102 - 98 = 4\n   \\]\n   This is much easier than calculating large squares.\n4. Compute \\(a+b\\):\n   \\[\n   102 + 98 = 200\n   \\]\n   Again, relatively simple.\n\nNow, calculate the product:\n- Multiply these results: \n  \\[\n  (102^2 - 98^2) = (4)(200)\n  \\]\n\nMultiplying these values gives:\n\\[\n4 \\times 200 = 800\n\\]\n\nChecking and Reflecting on the Approach:\n\n- Quick check if the numbers seem reasonable: Considering simple multipliers 4 and 200, the result of 800 seems reasonable and not overly large or small.\n- Reflect on the process: Using the difference of squares drastically simplified things due to smaller and straightforward multiplications instead of calculating two big squares and then subtracting.\n\nDeeper Reflection:\n\n- Could calculation errors occur? Double-check \\(4 \\times 200\\): \\(4 \\times 200\\) indeed equals 800 with straightforward multiplication.\n- Does the difference of squares apply generally? Yes, it applies ideally here, as this is exactly the scenario it's designed for\u2014simplifying difference calculations like \\(102^2 - 98^2\\).\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe calculated result is checked and seems correct: \n\\[\n\\boxed{800}\n\\]",
