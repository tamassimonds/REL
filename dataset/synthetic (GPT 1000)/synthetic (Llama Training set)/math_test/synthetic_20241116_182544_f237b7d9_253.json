    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with a step-by-step approach.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I notice it's dealing with angles in a triangle. My initial thought is that the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. This might be important because I can use this information to set up an equation. Let's think: angle A is \\(x\\) degrees, angle B is \\(2x\\) degrees, and angle C is \\(5x\\) degrees. This feels straightforward, but I need to make sure I understand how to proceed with setting this up.\n\n**Brainstorming and First Strategy:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Information:** \n   - Triangle ABC has angles \\(A = x\\), \\(B = 2x\\), and \\(C = 5x\\).\n   - The sum of angles in any triangle equals 180 degrees.\n\n2. **Set Up an Equation:** \n   - Since I know the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, I can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   x + 2x + 5x = 180\n   \\]\n   This looks like an algebra problem where I need to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n**Solving the Equation:**\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms:**\n   - Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   x + 2x + 5x = 8x\n   \\]\n   So, the equation simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   8x = 180\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{180}{8}\n   \\]\n   Okay, a quick check of division:\n   \\[\n   x = 22.5\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet me reflect on whether my solution makes sense. I've used a well-known property of triangles and found that \\(x = 22.5\\) degrees. To ensure that this is correct, let's calculate each angle based on this solution, just to verify:\n\n- \\(A = 22.5\\) degrees\n- \\(B = 2x = 2 \\times 22.5 = 45\\) degrees\n- \\(C = 5x = 5 \\times 22.5 = 112.5\\) degrees\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Sum them all up: \n  \\[\n  22.5 + 45 + 112.5 = 180\n  \\]\n  \nThe sum of these angles does indeed equal 180 degrees, which confirms that the solution is consistent with the properties of a triangle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe solution seems solid \u2013 using the triangle's angle sum property, the calculations are checked, and the solution is verified. The value of \\(x\\) is indeed \\(22.5\\) degrees, expressed to the nearest tenth. It makes sense within the context given, and it stays true to the basic geometry rules for triangles.",
