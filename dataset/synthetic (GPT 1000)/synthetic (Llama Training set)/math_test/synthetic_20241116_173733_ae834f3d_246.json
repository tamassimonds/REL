    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive in and approach the problem step-by-step as if we were working on it together and thinking out loud.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem involves a reciprocal, which immediately makes me think this is about fractions, since reciprocals are just 1 divided by a number. The equation here seems a bit familiar but hasn't totally clicked yet. It's saying three plus something equals another thing. So let\u2019s break this down.\n\nIt seems like we need to find a number where if you add three to its reciprocal, you get seven divided by the number itself. Hmm, this reminds me of algebra, so maybe setting up an equation would help?\n\n**Brainstorming Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Equation Setup:**\n   - Immediately, I think of writing the reciprocal as \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\), where \\(x\\) is the unknown number. Then write 7 divided by the number \\(x\\) as \\(\\frac{7}{x}\\). So, the equation might be \\(3 + \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{7}{x}\\).\n\n2. **Clear the Denominator:**\n   - Differently, if I multiply everything by \\(x\\), I can get rid of the fractions. This approach often simplifies solving. So if I write it down, I get: \n     \\[\n     x(3) + 1 = 7.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Reflection on Method:**\n   - I think this makes sense, as removing the fractions should make solving easier. Hmm, so far this seems to fit logically.\n\n**Deep Dive: Solving the Equation:**\n\nOkay, now for the straightforward algebra step:\n1. The equation simplifies to \\(3x + 1 = 7\\).\n2. Subtract 1 from both sides to isolate terms involving x: \n   \\[\n   3x = 6.\n   \\]\n3. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n   \\[\n   x = 2.\n   \\]\n   \n**Checking the Solution:**\n\nLet me think about whether this approach makes sense... \n\n1. **Quick Check of Steps:**\n   - Plug \\(x = 2\\) back into the original equation to verify: \n     \\[\n     3 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}.\n     \\]\n     Simplifying both sides:\n   - Left: \\(3 + 0.5 = 3.5\\)\n   - Right: \\(\\frac{7}{2} = 3.5\\).\n\nSince both sides are indeed equal, \\(\\boxed{2}\\) appears to be correct!\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems right. No alarms went off. It followed through logically.\n\n- There weren't major dead ends, just going through the motions of simplifying and checking.\n- Multiplying to clear the denominator worked well.\n\n**Thoughts on the Approach:**\n\nThe approach centered around getting rid of awkward fractions, which is usually something I aim for in these types of problems. Happy with how it turned out! \n\nIf there were any doubts, re-checking and recalculations confirmed \\(x = 2\\) is our answer.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number.  Converting the words in the problem into an equation gives us $3+\\dfrac{1}{x} = \\dfrac{7}{x}$.  Subtracting $\\dfrac{1}{x}$ from both sides gives $3 = \\dfrac{6}{x}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $x$ gives $3x =6$, and dividing both sides of this equation by 3 gives $x = \\boxed{2}$."
