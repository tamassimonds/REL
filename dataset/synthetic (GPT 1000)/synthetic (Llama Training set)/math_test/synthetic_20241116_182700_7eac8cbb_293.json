    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\nHmm, okay. This looks like a combination problem. I'm asked to find \\(\\binom{15}{7}\\). I already know from the problem statement that \\(\\binom{14}{8} = 3003\\) and \\(\\binom{14}{7} = 3432\\). This problem is definitely prompting me to use some relationships between combinations.\n\nStrategies that come to mind:\n\n1. Use the fact that \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \\binom{n-1}{k}\\). This is known as Pascal's Identity.\n2. Direct calculation using the combination formula: \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\).\n3. Notice any symmetry or patterns from the given values such as \\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}\\).\n\nAlright, let\u2019s check if any of these strategies seem promising before diving deeper.\n\n1. **Pascal's Identity**: With this, I could write \\(\\binom{15}{7} = \\binom{14}{6} + \\binom{14}{7}\\). Hmm, but I don't have \\(\\binom{14}{6}\\). Maybe there's another way to connect these dots.\n\n2. **Let's try that symmetry idea**: \\(\\binom{14}{7} = \\binom{14}{7}\\) and \\(\\binom{14}{8} = \\binom{14}{6}\\), but that\u2019s not getting \\(\\binom{15}{7}\\) involved. Moving on.\n\n3. **Direct calculation**: I could try computing directly \\(\\binom{15}{7}\\) seemed a bit tedious but doesn\u2019t seem to utilize given information effectively right now.\n\nWait...Oh! Using Pascal\u2019s Identity more effectively:\n\nI can actually express \\(\\binom{15}{7}\\) directly using \\(\\binom{14}{7}\\) and \\(\\binom{14}{8}\\), the ones that were given! \n\n- Following Pascal's Identity: \n\\[ \\binom{15}{7} = \\binom{14}{6} + \\binom{14}{7} \\]\n\\[ = \\binom{14}{8} + \\binom{14}{7} \\]\nsince \\(\\binom{14}{6} = \\binom{14}{8}\\).\n\nAwesome, this feels promising because it's now just these known values:\n- \\(\\binom{14}{8} = 3003\\)\n- \\(\\binom{14}{7} = 3432\\)\n\nPlug these into Pascal's Identity:\n\\[ \\binom{15}{7} = 3003 + 3432 \\]\n\nSimple calculation:\n- \\(3003 + 3432 = 6435\\).\n\nGreat, so \\(\\binom{15}{7} = 6435\\).\n\nLet me reflect on this: \n\n- I used the given values effectively.\n- The approach made logical sense using Pascal's Identity.\n- The sum seems reasonable and matches the kind of values we commonly see for such combinations.\n  \nLooking back at the values, this approach feels correct. Here, the sum checks out and I\u2019ve utilized all the given information without needing to calculate from scratch.\n\nFinal answer: \\(\\binom{15}{7} = 6435\\).",
