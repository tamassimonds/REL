    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The task is to compute \\(\\dbinom{1001}{2}\\). Immediately, I recognize this as a binomial coefficient problem often related to combinations, where we're choosing 2 items from a set of 1001. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\nWhen I first look at binomial coefficients, I'm reminded of the formula:  \n\\[\n\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\nThis formula calculates the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements without regard to order. Here, we have \\(n = 1001\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let's begin by applying this formula.\n\n### Applying the Formula\n- First step is to substitute the values:  \n  \\[\n  \\dbinom{1001}{2} = \\frac{1001!}{2!(1001-2)!}\n  \\]\n  Which simplifies to:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1001!}{2! \\times 999!}\n  \\]\n\n- Immediately I notice that a lot will cancel between \\(1001!\\) and \\(999!\\). Let me expand \\(1001!\\) a bit to see this cancellation clearly:  \n  \\[\n  1001! = 1001 \\times 1000 \\times 999!\n  \\]\n  So substituting back, we get:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1001 \\times 1000 \\times 999!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 999!}\n  \\]\n\n- The \\(999!\\) terms cancel out:\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{1001 \\times 1000}{2 \\times 1}\n  \\]\n\n### Simplifying Further\n- Now, our job is simply to calculate \\(\\frac{1001 \\times 1000}{2}\\). Before rushing to multiply, let's check if it's simpler to divide first:\n  - Divide 1000 by 2:  \n    \\[\n    1000 \\div 2 = 500\n    \\]\n\n- This gives us:  \n  \\[\n  1001 \\times 500 = 500500\n  \\]\n\n### Double-Checking\n- Quick sanity check: The number 500500 seems plausible because it's about half of 1001 multiplied by 1000, which approximates an expected result.\n\nReflecting on each step, everything seems to align correctly with my understanding of combinations and the arithmetic involved. There's a feeling of confidence with the cancellation strategy used, affirming that the math holds well.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{1001}{2} = 500500\n\\]\n\nThis process was quite methodical, starting from understanding the formula, identifying cancellation, and checking arithmetic carefully. Each step logically followed the last, maintaining a correct pathway to the solution.",
