    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n1. We're given two expressions: \\(3a^2 + 19a + 30\\) and \\(a^2 + 6a + 9\\), both of which will be positive integers when \\(a\\) is a positive integer.\n2. The function \\(f(a)\\) is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two expressions.\n3. We need to find the maximum possible value of \\(f(a) - a\\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nThis looks like a problem where we need to explore the properties of polynomials and their divisors. The greatest common divisor of two polynomials can sometimes have interesting properties based on factors they share, especially when both are dependent on the same variable \\(a\\).\n\n**Step 1: Simplifying and Exploring Polynomial Expressions**\n\nLet's start by simplifying the second expression:\n\n\\[ a^2 + 6a + 9 = (a + 3)^2 \\]\n\nThat's a perfect square, handy to know.\n\nFor the first expression, let's not simplify it for now and think strategically. Sometimes checking small values of \\(a\\) can reveal patterns:\n\n- When \\(a = 1\\):\n  \\[ 3(1)^2 + 19(1) + 30 = 3 + 19 + 30 = 52 \\]\n  \\[ (1 + 3)^2 = 16 \\]\n  \\[ \\text{GCD}(52, 16) = 4 \\]\n\n- When \\(a = 2\\):\n  \\[ 3(2)^2 + 19(2) + 30 = 12 + 38 + 30 = 80 \\]\n  \\[ (2 + 3)^2 = 25 \\]\n  \\[ \\text{GCD}(80, 25) = 5 \\]\n\n- When \\(a = 3\\):\n  \\[ 3(3)^2 + 19(3) + 30 = 27 + 57 + 30 = 114 \\]\n  \\[ (3 + 3)^2 = 36 \\]\n  \\[ \\text{GCD}(114, 36) = 6 \\]\n\n**Pattern Observation:**\n\nAt a glance, the GCD appears to consistently be increasing with higher \\(a\\). My initial attempt shows GCDs of 4, 5, and 6 \u2013 this is interesting.\n\n**Step 2: Verifying with Algebraic Approach**\n\nMaybe I should explore algebraic properties now. We need to examine their differences.\n\nFind the difference of the expressions:\n\\[ 3a^2 + 19a + 30 - (a^2 + 6a + 9) = 2a^2 + 13a + 21 \\]\n\nDifferences in these equations sometimes help to see common factors.\n\n**Step 3: Relating the Expressions through Differences**\n\nAha! The difference might highlight shared or common factors, but the expressions themselves are tricky since the greatest common divisor isn't trivial:\n\nLet's compute this difference modulo \\(a+3\\) (since \\((a+3)^2\\) is a form):\n\\[ 2a^2 + 13a + 21 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{a+3} \\]\n\nNow, trusting our computations, checking further, we can ascertain potential GCD values from observed results again:\n\n\\[ \\text{For} \\, a = 4 \\quad \\text{GCD}: ... \\]\n\\[ 3(4)^2 + 19(4) + 30 = 141 \\]\n\\[ (4 + 3)^2 = 49 \\]\nGCD is \\(\\text{GCD}(141, 49) = 7\\).\n\n**Conclusion and Attempt for Question\u2019s Requirement:**\n\n\\[\nf(a) - a \\, \\text{when} \\, a = 4 \\, \\text{provides} \\, 7 - 4 = 3\n\\]\n\nBased on my results, I strongly feel that the maximum \\(f(a) - a\\) seems to be 3, noted when \\(a = 4\\).\n\nThis seems rational considering typical polynomial behavior and derived values through practical checks. Would double-check any additional algebraic insights if required, but this seems fitting given this recursive proof. If \\(a\\) grew, \\(f(a) - a\\) tighten because \\(a\\) increases faster typically unless found divisor grows too.",

  "ground_truth": "By the Euclidean algorithm, we have  \\begin{align*}\n&\\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,a^2+6a+9) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,3a^2+19a+30-3(a^2+6a+9)) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}(3a^2+19a+30,a+3) \\\\\n&\\qquad= a+3,\n\\end{align*}since the integer $3a^2+19a+30$ is divisible by $a+3$ for all integers $a$, as the factorization $3a^2+19a+30=(3a+10)(a+3)$ shows. Thus $f(a)-a$ is equal to 3 for all positive integers $a$, so its maximum value is $\\boxed{3}$."
