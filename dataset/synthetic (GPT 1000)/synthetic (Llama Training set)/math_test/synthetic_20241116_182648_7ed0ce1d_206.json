    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem with an open mind and explore the best way to tackle it.\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Understanding\n\nThe problem asks us to find how many zeros are at the end of \\( (100!)(200!)(300!) \\). From past experience, I know zeros at the end of a number are contributed by factors of 10 in its prime factorization. Because 10 is made up of 2 and 5, the number of zeros will be determined by the number of complete pairs of these factors. \n\nMy first instinct is to think about how to count these pairs. I remember a strategy involving counting just the number of 5s since 2s are more abundant than 5s in a factorial expansion.\n\n### Exploring Different Strategies\n\n1. **Count Factors of 5**: \n   - I know from experience that each multiple of 5 contributes a factor of 5, and multiples of 25 contribute an extra, and so on. This approach has worked in similar problems before.\n   \n2. **Direct Calculation**: \n   - Trying a different approach, maybe directly calculate 100!, 200! and 300! and see if there's a pattern, but I quickly realize it's impractical due to the massive size of factorials.\n\n3. **Break Down**: \n   - Piecewise calculation: Break down \\( (100!)(200!)(300!) \\) into manageable parts or sub-problems. But again, it seems counting 5s is most straightforward.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s stick with counting the factors of 5.\n\n### Calculating Step-by-Step\n\n**Counting Factors of 5**:\n\n- **For 100!**:\n  - Multiples of 5 contribute at each step. Calculate as follows:\n    - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 20 \\)\n    - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 4 \\)\n    - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\) (since 125 > 100, no contribution here)\n  - Total factors of 5: \\( 20 + 4 = 24 \\)\n\n- **For 200!**:\n  - Similar process:\n    - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 40 \\)\n    - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\)\n    - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\)\n  - Total factors of 5: \\( 40 + 8 + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n- **For 300!**:\n  - Again, similar steps:\n    - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 60 \\)\n    - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 12 \\)\n    - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 2 \\)\n  - Total factors of 5: \\( 60 + 12 + 2 = 74 \\)\n\n### Summing Up and Reflecting\n\n- Now, to find the total number of 5s in the product \\( (100!)(200!)(300!) \\), sum up the individual 5s:\n  - Total = \\( 24 + 49 + 74 = 147 \\)\n\n**Final Reflection**:\n\n- This feels right because I've approached the problem based on its core requirement: counting 5s accurately.\n- The process seems consistent with solving similar problems, and my calculations seem correct at each step.\n- The order of magnitude makes sense given the input sizes: hundreds of terms in multiplying the factorials.\n\nThus, I conclude there are **147 zeros** at the end of \\( (100!)(200!)(300!) \\) when multiplied out.",

  "ground_truth": "The number of zeros at the end of a number is equivalent to the number of factors of 10 that number has. Since there are more factors of 2 than there are of 5 in a factorial, this is determined by the number of factors of 5. So, we go about computing this for each factorial separately.\n\nTo count the number of zeroes at the end of $100!$, we must count the number of factors of 5 in the product.  There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ multiples of 5 from 1 to 100. (The notation $\\left\\lfloor x\\right\\rfloor$ means the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, so basically, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ means \"divide 100 by 5 and round down.\")  This gives us 20 multiples of 5.  But the multiples of 25 contribute an additional factor of 5, so we have to add in the total number of multiples of 25, which gives us a total number of factors of 5 of $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 20+ 4 = 24$.\n\nSimilarly, for $200!$ the contributed zeros total $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 40 + 8 + 1 = 49$; and for $300!$, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 60 + 12 + 2 = 74$. So, our answer is $24 + 49 + 74 = \\boxed{147}$."
