    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and figure out the value of \\(A + B + C\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: We are given the expression \\(\\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C} = \\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\). The first thing I notice is that we're dealing with a fraction involving a square root. My gut feeling is this involves manipulating radicals and simplifying.\n \n2. **Constraints and Conditions**: \n   - \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are coprime (they share no common prime factors).\n   - \\(B\\) must not have any perfect-square factors other than 1, meaning \\(B\\) should be square-free.\n\n3. **Goal**: Find values for \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) that satisfy these conditions, then calculate \\(A + B + C\\).\n\n### Strategy Brainstorm:\n\n- **Rationalizing**: My first instinct is to get rid of the square root in the denominator on the right-hand side to make comparison easier.\n- **Equate Parts**: We might equate the rational and irrational components separately.\n- **Cross-Multiplication**: Consider cross-multiplying to simplify the equation further.\n\nLet\u2019s try starting with rationalizing and see where it leads.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Rationalize the Denominator**:\n\n   The expression on the right-hand side is \\(\\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\). To rationalize:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{6} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Now we have simplified it to \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Equate Expressions**:\n\n   Now we have:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{A\\sqrt{B}}{C} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   **Cross-multiply** to eliminate the fraction:\n\n   \\[\n   2A\\sqrt{B} = 3C\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Separate Components**:\n\n   The presence of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) suggests \\(B = 3\\) because for the radicals to match, the term inside the radicals on both sides must be the same.\n\n   Thus, \\(B = 3\\).\n\n4. **Simplified Equation**:\n\n   With \\(B = 3\\), the equation becomes:\n   \n   \\[\n   2A\\sqrt{3} = 3C\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n   **Cancel out \\(\\sqrt{3}\\)** from both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   2A = 3C\n   \\]\n\n   Now we have a simpler relationship between \\(A\\) and \\(C\\).\n\n5. **Finding \\(A\\) and \\(C\\)**:\n\n   Given \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) must be coprime, let's examine \\(2A = 3C\\). Since they have no common prime factors, the natural choice is \\(A = 3\\) and \\(C = 2\\) because:\n\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3 = 3 \\times 2\n   \\]\n\n   This satisfies the equation and ensures \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are coprime.\n\n### Verify:\n\nSo, to verify, we have \\(A = 3\\), \\(B = 3\\), and \\(C = 2\\). Let's check:\n\n- **Substitution** in the original equation gives:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{3 \\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n  \\]\n\n  This confirms our calculations.\n\n### Final Calculation:\n\n- The sum \\(A + B + C = 3 + 3 + 2 = 8\\).\n\nThus, the final value of \\(A + B + C\\) is \\(\\boxed{8}\\). \n\nThis method feels rigorous and accounts for all provided conditions. It\u2019s satisfying to see the components align perfectly given the constraints.",
