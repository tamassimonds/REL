    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\nAlright, let's see what this question is asking. We need to find the difference between the positive square root of 64 and the cube root of 64. When I see 'positive square root', I know it's asking for the non-negative root because square roots can be negative or positive, but often people are more interested in the positive root. 'Cube root', on the other hand, can be negative, zero, or positive, but since we have a positive number here, it'll be positive.\n\nOkay, let's break it down:\n\n1. Finding the positive square root of 64:\n   - I immediately think this is 8 because I'm familiar with my square numbers. \n   - But let me break it down. What is the square root of a number? It's a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the number. So \\( x^2 = 64 \\).\n   - I can't help but do a quick mental check: \\( 8 \\times 8 = 64 \\). Yes, that adds up.\n\n2. Finding the cube root of 64:\n   - Hmm, not as immediate for me as the square root. Let's see, the cube root of a number is a value that, when used in triple multiplication, gives the original number. So \\( x^3 = 64 \\).\n   - Immediately 4 comes to mind, since I've solved similar problems before. \n   - Quick check: \\( 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\times 4 = 64 \\). Yep, that computes correctly.\n\nAlright, now I have both individual roots:\n\n- Positive square root of 64 is 8.\n- Cube root of 64 is 4.\n\nNext step is to calculate the difference between these two:\n\n3. Subtract the cube root from the square root:\n   - Here we just perform a simple subtraction: \\( 8 - 4 = 4 \\).\n\nLet's do a sanity check:\n\n- Does everything make sense? Yes, no crazy numbers popped out, and my mental math feels correct. \n- Both parts of my calculations checked out when I reviewed them. I believe my approach was straightforward given the problem and the types of numbers I was dealing with.\n\nFinally, to state my answer:\n\nThe difference between the positive square root of 64 and the cube root of 64 is 4.",
