    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We want to find how many divisors \\( n \\) has given a specific condition regarding its prime factors and the number of divisors of \\( n^2 \\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nLooking at the problem, \\( n \\) is a natural number with exactly two positive prime divisors. This suggests that \\( n \\) can be expressed in the form \\( n = p^a \\cdot q^b \\) where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers. Immediately, I recall that there's a formula for finding the number of divisors of a number.\n\nGiven that \\( n^2 \\) has 27 divisors, there is definitely a relationship between the exponents \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) of the prime factors of \\( n \\).\n\n**Diving Deeper:**\n\nLet's express \\( n^2 = (p^a \\cdot q^b)^2 = p^{2a} \\cdot q^{2b} \\). The formula for counting divisors of a number based on its prime factorization is to take the exponents, add 1 to each, and multiply the results. \n\nSo, the number of divisors of \\( n^2 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n(2a + 1)(2b + 1) = 27\n\\]\n\nThis equation needs to be solved for positive integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Strategizing:**\n\nI need to think about factor pairs of 27 because the product of two such can satisfy the equation. The factor pairs for 27 are: \n- (1, 27)\n- (3, 9)\n- (9, 3)\n- (27, 1)\n\nI need to test these pairs for \\( (2a+1) \\) and \\( (2b+1) \\) to find valid integer values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Checking:**\n\n1. **Case 1: (2a+1) = 3, (2b+1) = 9**\n\n   - Solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   2a + 1 = 3 \\implies 2a = 2 \\implies a = 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2b + 1 = 9 \\implies 2b = 8 \\implies b = 4\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, one possibility is \\( (a, b) = (1, 4) \\).\n\n2. **Case 2: (2a+1) = 9, (2b+1) = 3**\n\n   - Solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   2a + 1 = 9 \\implies 2a = 8 \\implies a = 4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2b + 1 = 3 \\implies 2b = 2 \\implies b = 1\n   \\]\n\n   So another possibility is \\( (a, b) = (4, 1) \\).\n\n3. **Case 3: Other factor pairs ((1, 27) or (27, 1)) do not work.**\n\n   These pairs would give non-integer solutions for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFor both solutions, the prime factorizations are the same under permutation: either \\( n = p \\cdot q^4 \\) or \\( n = p^4 \\cdot q \\). These are the possible forms for \\( n \\) with \\( a = 1, b = 4 \\) or \\( a = 4, b = 1 \\).\n\n**Determining Number of Divisors of \\( n \\):**\n\nThe number of divisors of \\( n = p^a \\cdot q^b \\) is given by \\((a+1)(b+1)\\).\n\nTesting:\n- For \\( a = 1, b = 4 \\) (and vice versa), the number of divisors is:\n  \\[\n  (1+1)(4+1) = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( n \\) has **10 divisors**. \n\nThis makes sense and fits the divisor count condition perfectly given what we calculated for the possible \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). This approach is consistent and logical given the factorization details.\n\n**Final Verification:**\n\nBoth possible forms of \\( n \\) correspond to completely filling the initial requirement of having two distinct prime factors and \\( n^2 \\) having 27 divisors. Thus, the solution seems correct and thorough.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the prime divisors of $n$, so we can write $n = p^a \\cdot q^b$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$.  This means $n^2 = p^{2a} \\cdot q^{2b}$, so $t(n^2) = (2a + 1)(2b + 1) = 27$.  Since $2a + 1$ and $2b + 1$ are both greater than 1 and are divisors of 27, we know they are 3 and 9 (in no particular order).  This means that $a$ and $b$ are 1 and 4 (in no particular order), so $$ t(n) = (a + 1)(b + 1) = (1 + 1)(4 + 1) = \\boxed{10}. $$"
