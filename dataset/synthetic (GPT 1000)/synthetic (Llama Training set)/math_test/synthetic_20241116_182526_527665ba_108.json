  "problem": "A restaurant offers three desserts, and exactly twice as many appetizers as main courses. A dinner consists of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert. What is the least number of main courses that the restaurant should offer so that a customer could have a different dinner each night in the year 2003?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Initially, it looks like a combinatorial problem with a restaurant menu as its base context. The question demands figuring out how many main courses are necessary so that a diner can have a different meal every night of the year 2003. \n\n### First Thoughts:\n1. **Understand the context:** \n   - There are three components to a dinner: appetizer, main course, and dessert.\n   - There are exactly three desserts.\n   - There are twice as many appetizers as main courses.\n\n2. **Key Focus:** \n   - Determine the minimum number of main courses needed to achieve at least 365 distinct dinners, since 2003 is not a leap year.\n\n3. **Initial Idea:** \n   - We will calculate the number of possible different dinners assuming we know the number of main courses, and find the scenario where this exceeds or matches 365.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n#### Step 1: Formulate the Problem Mathematically\n- Total combinations of dinners = (Number of Appetizers) \u00d7 (Number of Main Courses) \u00d7 (Number of Desserts).\n- Let \\( M \\) be the number of main courses.\n- Therefore, Number of Appetizers = \\( 2M \\).\n\n#### Step 2: Develop the Combination Equation\n- From the logic above: \\( 2M \\times M \\times 3 \\) should be \u2265 365.\n\n#### Step 3: Simplifying the Equation\nLet's simplify that equation:\n\\[ 6M^2 \\geq 365 \\]\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\\[ M^2 \\geq \\frac{365}{6} \\]\nNow, \\(\\frac{365}{6} \\approx 60.83\\).\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate\nTake the square root to solve for \\( M \\):\n\\[ M \\geq \\sqrt{60.83} \\]\n\nThis is approximately:\n\\[ M \\approx 7.8 \\]\n\nSince \\( M \\) must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a main course), let's try \\( M = 8 \\) and check:\n\n#### Step 5: Verification\n- If \\( M = 8 \\):\n  - Number of Appetizers = \\( 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\)\n  - Number of Main Courses = \\( 8 \\)\n  - Number of Desserts = \\( 3 \\)\n  \nCalculate the total combinations:\n\\[ 16 \\times 8 \\times 3 = 384 \\]\n\nSince 384 is greater than 365, this configuration allows at least one unique dinner each night throughout the year 2003. Also, checking for \\( M = 7 \\):\n- If \\( M = 7 \\):\n  - Number of Appetizers = \\( 14 \\)\n  - Total combinations: \\( 14 \\times 7 \\times 3 = 294 \\)\n\n294 is less than 365, confirming \\( M = 8 \\) is indeed the minimum viable solution.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe least number of main courses that the restaurant should offer to provide a distinct dinner every night in 2003 is **8**.\n\n### Reflection:\nThe approach seemed correct, as each possibility was checked thoroughly, ensuring no dinner was repeated less than 365 nights, justifying 8 main courses correctly satisfy this requirement.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $m$ denote the number of main courses needed to meet the requirement. Then the number of dinners available is $3\\cdot m \\cdot 2m = 6m^2$.  Thus $m^2$ must be at least $365/6 \\approx 61$.  Since $7^2 = 49<61<64 = 8^2$, $\\boxed{8}$ main courses is enough, but 7 is not."
