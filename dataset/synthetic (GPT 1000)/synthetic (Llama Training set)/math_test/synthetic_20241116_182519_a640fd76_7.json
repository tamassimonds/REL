    "working_out": "Okay, let's work through this problem step by step and I'll try to document my thought process quite naturally.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nFirst of all, when I look at this problem, I'm thinking about combinations. I have to compute \\(\\binom{15}{7}\\), which is the number of ways to choose 7 items from a set of 15. The combination formula comes to mind: \n\n\\[ \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\]\n\nBut then I notice that I'm given \\(\\binom{14}{8} = 3003\\) and \\(\\binom{14}{7} = 3432\\). This seems significant. Could there be a connection that simplifies my work? \n\n#### Reflecting on Given Combinations\n\nI remember a property of combinations that might be helpful: \n\n\\[ \\binom{n}{r} = \\binom{n-1}{r-1} + \\binom{n-1}{r} \\]\n\nThis is similar to Pascal's Triangle. Maybe I can use this to relate \\(\\binom{15}{7}\\) to the given values. Let me explore this path further.\n\n### Using Pascal's Identity\n\nLet's apply Pascal's identity:\n\n\\[ \\binom{15}{7} = \\binom{14}{6} + \\binom{14}{7} \\]\n\nA quick check, and I find that I don't directly have \\(\\binom{14}{6}\\), nor have I computed it yet.\n\nOh, wait! \\(\\binom{14}{8} = 3003\\), and \\(\\binom{14}{8} = \\binom{14}{6}\\) due to symmetry of combinations: \\(\\binom{n}{r} = \\binom{n}{n-r}\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\binom{14}{6} = 3003\\).\n\nGreat! Now I substitute these values:\n\n\\[ \\binom{15}{7} = 3003 + 3432 \\]\n\n**Calculating the Sum:**\n\nLet's carefully compute the sum of these two numbers.\n\n- 3003\n- + 3432\n---------\n- 6435\n\n### Verification\n\nLet me quickly verify if the number \"6435\" looks plausible.\n\n- Given the property \\( \\binom{n}{r} = \\binom{n}{n-r}\\), and symmetry around the midpoint in Pascal's triangle, this value isn't too surprising.\n- The calculation using Pascal's identity seems sound.\n\n#### Final Thoughts\n\nInitially, it seemed like I might need to compute more from scratch, but recognizing useful properties and relating given values really helped. \n\nI think I've computed \\(\\binom{15}{7}\\) correctly using the given relations:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6435} \\]\n\nThis exercise was a good reminder of how using properties of combinations can save a lot of computation and helps double-check work along the way!",
