    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Operation Defined in the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts: Okay, the problem introduces a custom operation `*` defined by the equation \\( a * b = 2a + 3b \\). This isn't the normal multiplication we're used to. I need to apply this operation specifically as the problem describes.\n\nInitial strategy: Before jumping to conclusions, let\u2019s break down what this custom operation does. It's clear that for any two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the operation will result in \\(2a\\) plus \\(3b\\).\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Custom Operation to the Given Numbers**\n\nI need to find \\( 4 * 3 \\). According to the operation defined, it's not \\(4 \\times 3\\), but rather I should substitute \\(a = 4\\) and \\(b = 3\\) into the expression \\(2a + 3b\\).\n\nSo, let\u2019s compute this:\n\n\\[\n4 * 3 = 2(4) + 3(3)\n\\]\n\nNow, do the math:\n\n\\[\n= 2 \\times 4 + 3 \\times 3\n= 8 + 9\n= 17\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Reflect on the Calculation**\n\nThis seems straightforward now. Wait, let me double-check if I applied the operation correctly. The definition is clear: \\(2a + 3b\\). Yes, for \\(a=4\\) and \\(b=3\\), the steps I took seem correct.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Possible Misinterpretations**\n\nHmm, let's think if there could be any pitfalls. Could I have misunderstood the operation? I don't think so. The operation seems unambiguous. There shouldn't be a mistake in following how \\(2a + 3b\\) works because it relies on simple arithmetic I confirmed above.\n\n**Step 5: Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\nThis reminds me of problems where you replace traditional operations with defined ones. The key is sticking to the operation\u2019s definition and applying it methodically. It's important not to assume any default arithmetic rules when a new operation is defined.\n\nRevisiting everything, I\u2019m confident I applied the operation correctly and my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the value of \\(4 * 3\\) using the operation \\(a * b = 2a + 3b\\) is indeed **17**.",
