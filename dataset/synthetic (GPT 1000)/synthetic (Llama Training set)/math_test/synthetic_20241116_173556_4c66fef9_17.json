    "working_out": "First Thoughts and Initial Explorations\n---\n\nOkay, so we've got these seven beads, each of a different color, that we need to arrange on a hexagonal grid, with the challenge being that rotations and reflections of any given arrangement count as the same. Right away, this suggests some sort of symmetry consideration with group actions.\n\nThis problem might remind me of similar combinatorial problems involving circular arrangements or necklaces, where I had to factor in rotational symmetry. But the hexagonal grid adds an extra twist, including considerations for reflections.\n\nMaybe we could approach this using something like Burnside's Lemma, which is often useful for counting distinct arrangements under group actions. Let me walk through what using Burnside\u2019s Lemma would look like \u2013 essentially, it involves understanding the symmetry of the problem.\n\nUnderstanding the Symmetries\n---\n\nThe hexagon grid's symmetries would include rotations and reflections. \n\n1. **Rotations**: I can rotate the hexagon by 60 degrees, 120 degrees, all the way to 300 degrees (6 positions including the initial/identity rotation). \n2. **Reflections**: There are also axes through opposite vertices (3 axes) and through opposite midpoints of the edges (3 axes), making a total of 6 reflection axes.\n\nIn total, there seems to be \\(6 + 6 = 12\\) symmetries in this group. This matches the dihedral group \\(D_6\\) which is common for a hexagonal configuration. So that's consistent \u2013 good.\n\nApplying Burnside's Lemma\n---\n\nAccording to Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinct arrangements (orbits) is the average number of arrangements fixed by each symmetry. Let\u2019s calculate the fixed points for each rotation and reflection.\n\n### Rotations:\n1. **Identity (0 degrees)**: Every permutation of 7 beads is valid here. Since there are 7 distinct beads, there are \\(7! = 5040\\) fixed arrangements.\n\n2. **Rotations by 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 degrees**: For any rotation other than 0 degrees, an arrangement can only stay fixed if it repeats the same colors in a cyclical pattern, impossible for 7 unique colors. Thus, no fixed points for these rotations.\n\n### Reflections:\n1. **Reflection Symmetries**: Each reflection swaps beads across the axis, so for an arrangement to be invariant under reflection, beads must pair across the reflection line the same color. With all beads distinct, there can't be any such symmetric repeat. Thus, no fixed arrangements under any reflection.\n\nCalculating with Burnside's Lemma:\n---\n\nNow, Burnside\u2019s Lemma gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of distinct arrangements} = \\frac{1}{12} \\left(5040 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0\\right) = \\frac{5040}{12} = 420\n\\]\n\nFinal Reflections and Cross-Check\n---\n\nChecking against expectations, the symmetry considerations seemed straightforward with clearly identifiable symmetries of the hexagon and unique beads preventing repetitions needed for fixes under non-identity actions. \n\nThe calculation \\( \\frac{5040}{12} = 420 \\) makes logical sense: the vast majority of rotational and reflective symmetries disrupt any distinct arrangement, leaving rotations symmetry to account entirely for the invariance.\n\nThis seems consistent and convincing now. By tackling a similar hexagonal symmetry problem through structured group action and applying Burnside\u2019s Lemma correctly, 420 appears to be sound for the number of distinct arrangements. \n\nLet's lock in the solution: **420 distinct arrangements** of the seven beads on a hexagonal grid under symmetric equivalences of reflections and rotations.",

  "ground_truth": "There are $7!$ ways to put the beads on the grid, not considering rotations and reflections. Arrangements can be reflected or not reflected and can be rotated by 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, or 300 degrees, so they come in groups of twelve equivalent arrangements. Correcting for the symmetries, we find that there are $7!/12=\\boxed{420}$ distinct arrangements."
