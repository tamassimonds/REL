    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We want to find the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than 1000 for which there exists a positive real number \\( x \\) such that \\( n = x \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\). Here's how I think we can approach this:\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nFirst impressions: This kind of resembles problems involving floor functions and product conditions. We're dealing with an integer result from multiplying \\( x \\) and its floor value. It's a bit intriguing because it mixes continuous and discrete mathematics.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n1. **Understand the Floor Function:** The floor function, \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\), gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \\( x \\). This means \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\) is an integer \\( k \\leq x < k+1 \\).\n\n2. **Expression Interpretation:** So if \\( x \\lfloor x \\rfloor = n \\), then let \\( k = \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\). Therefore, \\( n = xk \\), and since \\( k \\leq x < k+1 \\), this implies \\( n = xk \\).\n\n3. **Exploration of \\( x \\) Conditions:** We note that for \\( n = xk \\), rearranging gives \\( x = \\frac{n}{k} \\). Since \\( k \\leq \\frac{n}{k} < k+1 \\), we need \\( n \\) such that \\( k^2 \\leq n < k(k+1) \\).\n\n4. **Example Exploration:** Start with \\( k = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\) and see what conditions arise:\n    - For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( 1^2 \\leq n < 1(2) \\) gives \\( 1 \\leq n < 2 \\). The only integer is 1.\n    - For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( 4 \\leq n < 6 \\). Possible \\( n \\) are 4 and 5.\n    - For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( 9 \\leq n < 12 \\). Possible \\( n \\) are 9, 10, and 11.\n    - So on and so forth...\n\n5. **Generalization:** It seems for each \\( k \\), the range is \\( k^2 \\leq n < k^2 + k \\). Total integers for each \\( k \\) are \\( k \\).\n\n### Calculations\n\n1. Determine how far \\( k \\) can go:\n   - Since \\( n < 1000 \\), we need \\( k^2 < 1000 \\).\n   - Solving \\( k^2 < 1000 \\), gives \\( k < \\sqrt{1000} \\approx 31.62 \\). Hence the greatest integer \\( k \\) can be is 31.\n\n2. **Sum Up Possible \\( n \\):**\n   - Sum of integers from \\( 1 \\) to \\( 31 \\), inclusive, since for each \\( k \\), there are \\( k \\) valid \\( n \\)'s.\n   - Use the formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers: \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{31} k = \\frac{31(31+1)}{2} = \\frac{31 \\times 32}{2} = 496\\).\n\n### Reflection\n\n- This seems correct because:\n  - For each \\( k \\), we correctly identified the range based on \\( k^2 \\leq n < k^2 + k \\).\n  - The calculations and conditions align with the observations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than 1000 that can be expressed as \\( n = x \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\) for some positive real \\( x \\) is **496**.\n\nThis was a good exercise in blending the conceptual understanding of functions with mathematical reasoning to translate problem conditions into solvable equations. I'm quite confident in this solution since each step built logically onto the next, aligning with both the defined parameters of the problem and the realistic nature of calculations.",

  "ground_truth": "Note that $x \\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is strictly increasing in $x.$ Let $a$ be an integer. Given that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor = a,$ we have $a \\le x < a+1,$ so \\[a^2 \\le x\\lfloor x\\rfloor < a^2+a.\\]Therefore, $x \\lfloor x\\rfloor$ takes \\[(a^2+a-1) - a^2 + 1 = a\\]integer values over all $x$ such that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor = a.$\n\nNote that $x \\lfloor x\\rfloor = 1$ when $x = 1,$ and that if $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor < 1000,$ then $\\lfloor x\\rfloor^2 < 1000,$ so $a \\le 31.$ For $a = 1, 2, \\ldots, 31,$ we get \\[1 + 2 + \\dots + 31 = \\frac{31\\cdot32}{2} = 496\\]integer values of $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor.$ For $a \\ge 32,$ we have $x \\lfloor x\\rfloor \\ge a^2 = 1024 > 1000,$ so we do not get any more values of $n.$ The answer is $\\boxed{496}.$"
