    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step and try to capture my thought process as naturally as possible.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\nOkay, so the problem states that the owners of a house assessed at $120,000 pay $3,000 in taxes. Then we're asked to find out how much tax would be for a house assessed at $160,000. This seems like a problem involving ratios or proportions since we're dealing with a consistent rate of taxation. \n\n- This reminds me a lot of similar problems I've worked on before, where you need to find an unknown value using proportions or a simple ratio. \n- To start, I should focus on the relationship between the assessment value and the tax amount. \n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n1. **Ratio Method**: Let's try finding the tax rate as a percentage of the assessment value first. We can do this by dividing the tax by the assessment value. This will help us apply the same rate to the new assessment value.\n\n2. **Direct Proportion**: Another approach could be setting up a proportion directly between the known values and the unknown values.\n\n3. **Sanity Check**: Consider if our expected answer makes logical sense along the way.\n\n### Calculating the Tax Rate\n\nFirst, I'll check what the tax rate is for a house assessed at $120,000. \n\n- Tax paid = $3,000.\n- Assessment = $120,000.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the tax rate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Rate} = \\frac{3,000}{120,000} = 0.025 \\]\n\nThis rate appears reasonable since taxes are often expressed as a rate over the assessed value.\n\n### Applying the Tax Rate to the New Assessment\n\n- New Assessment = $160,000.\n  \nI'll apply this tax rate to the $160,000 assessment:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax for } \\$160,000 = \\$160,000 \\times 0.025 \\]\n\nLet me do the calculation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax for } \\$160,000 = \\$160,000 \\times 0.025 = \\$4,000 \\]\n\nOh! That seems like a significant jump in the tax, but it makes intuitive sense given the increase in the assessed value.\n\n### Quick Verification\n\nWait, let\u2019s quickly verify this. Hmm, the assessment value increased from $120,000 to $160,000 \u2013 that's an increase by a factor of \\( \\frac{160,000}{120,000} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\nThe tax also should increase by this factor if the rate is consistent:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Tax} = \\$3,000 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\$4,000 \\]\n\nYes, this aligns perfectly with our earlier calculation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe tax for a house assessed at $160,000 at the same tax rate is **$4,000**.\n\nReflecting on this approach, using the percentage tax rate and verifying with proportion both lead to the same result, confirming its correctness. This method ensures that any similar future problem can be tackled systematically. There we go! That feels right.",

  "ground_truth": "The value of the $\\$160,\\!000$ house is $\\frac{4}{3}$ of the value of the $\\$120,\\!000$ house, so the tax is $\\frac{4}{3}$ as great as well: $\\$3,\\!000\\cdot\\frac{4}{3}=\\boxed{\\$4,\\!000}$."
