    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We have two similar triangles, \\( \\triangle ABC \\) and \\( \\triangle XYZ \\). We're given some side lengths and need to find the length of one side in \\( \\triangle XYZ \\).\n\nFirst thoughts:\n- The problem is about similar triangles, so we can use the properties of similar triangles. In similar triangles, corresponding sides are proportional.\n- We're given sides \\( AB = 4 \\) units and \\( BC = 6 \\) units in \\( \\triangle ABC \\), and \\( XY = 14 \\) units in \\( \\triangle XYZ \\). We need to find \\( YZ \\).\n\nStrategies to consider:\n1. Identify corresponding sides between the triangles based on the given information.\n2. Set up proportions between corresponding sides to find \\( YZ \\).\n\nStep-by-step approach:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify Corresponding Sides**\n  - Corresponding sides in similar triangles are proportional. The problem tells us \\( AB \\) and \\( XY \\) are corresponding because both measurements are provided, so \\( AB/XY = BC/YZ \\).\n  - Thus, \\( AB \\leftrightarrow XY \\) and \\( BC \\leftrightarrow YZ \\).\n\n- **Step 2: Set Up the Proportion**\n  - The sides \\( AB \\) and \\( XY \\) give us the proportion: \n    \\[\n    \\frac{AB}{XY} = \\frac{BC}{YZ}\n    \\]\n    Plug in the known values:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{4}{14} = \\frac{6}{YZ}\n    \\]\n\n- **Step 3: Solve the Proportion**\n  - Cross-multiply to solve for \\( YZ \\):\n    \\[\n    4 \\cdot YZ = 6 \\cdot 14\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    4 \\cdot YZ = 84\n    \\]\n  - Divide both sides by 4 to isolate \\( YZ \\):\n    \\[\n    YZ = \\frac{84}{4} = 21\n    \\]\n  \n- **Step 4: Verify and Reflect**\n  - Does this answer make sense? Let's check:\n    - We decided \\( AB \\leftrightarrow XY \\) and \\( BC \\leftrightarrow YZ \\) were reasonable assumptions given problem data.\n    - Calculations logically follow the rules of proportions for similar triangles.\n    - \\( YZ = 21 \\) feels reasonable in scale when comparing to side \\( XY = 14 \\).\n\nI think we've got it. The side \\( YZ \\) measures 21 units. The steps logically flow with the mathematical rules around similar triangles. Let me double-check if there could be an easier method... Nope, setting up proportions directly was quite straightforward! I'll stick with our process. The solution seems consistent with the properties of similar triangles.",
