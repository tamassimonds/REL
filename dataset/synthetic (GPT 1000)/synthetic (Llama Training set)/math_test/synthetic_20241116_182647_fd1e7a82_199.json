    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n**First Thoughts and Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe given series \\( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{n^4 + n^2 + 1} \\) is an infinite series. This looks tricky at first glance. It's not an arithmetic series, nor a geometric series. I almost expect this to resemble some known series or converge in a way that makes the infinite sum calculable. But there's a polynomial in the denominator, which hints at either a telescoping nature or some nice property that simplifies the series. If I simplify the denominator or find a transformation, maybe it can be telescoped or checked for convergence.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Convergence Check**: Let's first check if the series is convergent or divergent. This can give some direction on whether further calculations are warranted.\n\n2. **Simplification of the Expression**: Maybe the expression can be re-written or factored. Sometimes recognizing a pattern helps.\n\n3. **Comparison or Limit Analysis**: Comparing with simpler series or using limit techniques might give insights into convergence.\n\n4. **Telescoping Series**: Check if the expression can be set up such that terms cancel out in a useful way, especially with polynomial expressions.\n\n**Step-by-Step Exploration:**\n\n**Convergence Check:**\n\n1. Let's consider series convergence by considering its terms' behavior:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n}{n^4 + n^2 + 1} \\approx \\frac{n}{n^4} = \\frac{1}{n^3} \\text{ for large } n.\n   \\]\n   So, the series resembles \\( \\sum \\frac{1}{n^3} \\) for large \\( n \\), which is a convergent p-series with \\( p > 1 \\).\n\n   **Reflection**: Since the series converges for large \\( n \\), there is a good chance the whole series converges.\n\n**Simplification**:\n\nLet's revisit the expression:\n- Trying to factor or find a pattern in the denominator \\( n^4 + n^2 + 1 \\).\n  - Initially, let's consider \\( n^2 + 1 = u \\).\n  - Then, \\( n^4 + n^2 + 1 = n^2(n^2+1) + 1 = n^2u + 1 \\).\n\n  This substitution doesn't yield a clean factorization, so another idea might be necessary.\n\n**Reconsidering Strategy**:\n\nHmm, let me rethink the breakdown of the polynomial. Given its structure, it still seems factorization won't lead to easy telescoping. Instead, I\u2019ll revisit analytical approaches:\n\n**New Approach - Limit Comparison:**\n\nGiven the approximation for large \\( n \\), let's apply a more definitive test:\n- Limit Comparison with \\( \\frac{1}{n^3} \\).\n  - Compute \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{n}{n^4 + n^2 + 1}}{\\frac{1}{n^3}}\\).\n\n  This is:\n  \\[\n  \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n^4}{n^4 + n^2 + 1} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{n^2} + \\frac{1}{n^4}} = 1.\n  \\]\n\n  Since the limit is finite and non-zero, by the Limit Comparison Test, our series converges similarly to \\( \\sum \\frac{1}{n^3} \\), which is convergent.\n\n  **Reflection**: Great, this confirms that the series converges, aligning with my earlier thought.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThe series \\( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{n^4 + n^2 + 1} \\) is convergent. We determined this by comparing it with a \\( \\frac{1}{n^3} \\) series using the Limit Comparison Test successfully.\n\nWow, this was a journey \u2014 from thinking it might telescope to checking convergence and then definitively using asymptotic techniques. Clear understanding and careful manipulation went a long way here.",

It follows that $$\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{n}{n^4+n^2+1}=\\frac{1}{2}\\Bigl((f(0)-f(1))+(f(1)-f(2))+(f(2)-f(3))+\\cdots\\Bigr).$$Since $f(n)$ tends towards 0 as $n$ gets large, this sum telescopes to $f(0)/2=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
