    "working_out": "Alright, let's delve into this problem step by step and really break down our thoughts as we go along.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nFirst, we need to comprehend what the problem is asking. We have two segments, \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\), each with specific endpoints. We're supposed to find the midpoint of the line segment whose endpoints are the midpoints of \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\).  \n\n### Step 2: Identify Known Information\n- Endpoint of \\(s_1\\): \\((3 + \\sqrt{2}, 5)\\) and \\((4, 7)\\)\n- Endpoint of \\(s_2\\): \\((6 - \\sqrt{2}, 3)\\) and \\((3, 5)\\)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Midpoints\nLet's find the midpoints of each segment. The formula for the midpoint \\((x_m, y_m)\\) of a segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is:\n\n\\[ x_m = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\quad y_m = \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\]\n\n**For Segment \\(s_1\\):**\n- Using endpoints \\((3+\\sqrt{2}, 5)\\) and \\((4, 7)\\):\n  - \\(x_m = \\frac{(3+\\sqrt{2}) + 4}{2} = \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{2}}{2}\\)\n  - \\(y_m = \\frac{5 + 7}{2} = 6\\)\n\nThus, the midpoint of \\(s_1\\) is:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{7 + \\sqrt{2}}{2}, 6\\right)\n\\]\n\n**For Segment \\(s_2\\):**\n- Using endpoints \\((6-\\sqrt{2}, 3)\\) and \\((3, 5)\\):\n  - \\(x_m = \\frac{(6-\\sqrt{2}) + 3}{2} = \\frac{9 - \\sqrt{2}}{2}\\)\n  - \\(y_m = \\frac{3 + 5}{2} = 4\\)\n\nThus, the midpoint of \\(s_2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{9 - \\sqrt{2}}{2}, 4\\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Midpoint of the New Segment\n\nNow, we need to find the midpoint of the segment with endpoints being the midpoints of \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\):\n\n1. First coordinate (x):\n   \\[\n   x_{\\text{midpoint}} = \\frac{\\frac{7 + \\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{9 - \\sqrt{2}}{2}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{16}{2}}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Second coordinate (y):\n   \\[\n   y_{\\text{midpoint}} = \\frac{6 + 4}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe midpoint of the segment whose endpoints are the midpoints of \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\) is \\((4, 5)\\).\n\nReflecting on the process:\n\n- Each step follows from basic arithmetic and operations with midpoints.\n- It's useful to verify each midpoint calculation individually to ensure accuracy.\n- The approach at each stage correctly leads to identifying the midpoints and solving for the final midpoint.\n\nThe final answer is the point \\((4, 5)\\).",
