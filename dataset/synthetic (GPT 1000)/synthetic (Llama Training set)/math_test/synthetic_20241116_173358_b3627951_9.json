The question is to find \\(\\sin 120^\\circ\\).\n\n### Step 1: Initial Thoughts\nWhen I see this problem, I immediately think about using the unit circle and reference angles. I remember that sometimes angles greater than \\(90^\\circ\\) can be located in different quadrants, and they have certain symmetries. But let's keep an open mind and think about different ways to approach this.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring Strategies\n- **Unit Circle Approach:** I know that \\(\\sin\\) values are derived from the y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle. I can remember that angles like 120\u00b0 are in the second quadrant.\n- **Reference Angle Method:** I think about how 120\u00b0 is related to other angles I might know, like 60\u00b0.\n- **Using Trigonometric Identities:** There might be identities or symmetry properties that can help.\n\n### Step 3: Unit Circle Exploration\nThe unit circle is my first go-to. Since 120\u00b0 is more than 90\u00b0, it's in the second quadrant. I know in the second quadrant, sine values are positive.\n\nLet's figure out the reference angle. If I subtract 120\u00b0 from 180\u00b0 (the straight line), I get:\n\\[ 180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 60^\\circ \\]\n\nOkay, so the reference angle for 120\u00b0 is 60\u00b0. Now, what's \\(\\sin 60^\\circ\\)?\n\n\\[ \\sin 60^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\]\n\nSince 120\u00b0 is in the second quadrant where sine is positive, \\(\\sin 120^\\circ = \\sin 60^\\circ\\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculation and Check\nThus, \\(\\sin 120^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\nLet me take a moment to reflect: Does this make sense? In the unit circle, the reference angle method should work, and I'm confident:\n- 60\u00b0 has a sine of \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n- 120\u00b0 is in the second quadrant where sine should indeed be positive.\n\n### Step 5: Verify with Trig Identity\nAnother way to check this is by using the sine addition formula:\n\\[ \\sin(120^\\circ) = \\sin(90^\\circ + 30^\\circ) \\]\n\nUsing the identity \\(\\sin(a + b) = \\sin a \\cos b + \\cos a \\sin b\\):\n- \\(\\sin 90^\\circ = 1\\)\n- \\(\\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)\n- \\(\\cos 90^\\circ = 0\\)\n- \\(\\sin 30^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nSubstitute these in:\n\\[ \\sin(120^\\circ) = (1 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nIt looks like my reasoning through the unit circle aligns perfectly with the trigonometric identity approach. The value \\(\\sin 120^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) appears correct through both methods. \n\nThis was a good check! It feels satisfying to see both methods converge to the same result. My confidence in the approach and answer is stronger now. It's neat how both techniques confirmed our solution!",
