    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and solve it step by step.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\nOkay, this problem seems to be about calculating total earnings based on a base salary and a commission from sales. It reminds me of other problems involving percentages and additional components to a basic salary. I think I have a pretty good starting point with this.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nSo, Louis earns a base salary of $1,200 every month. On top of that, he gets a 5% commission on his sales. This month, he made $25,000 in sales. We need to figure out his total earnings, which would be the base salary plus the commission from his sales.\n\n**Step 2: Calculating the Commission**\n\nI know that commission is typically calculated as a percentage of sales. In this case, it's 5% of $25,000. Let's calculate that.\n\n- First, I need to convert 5% into a decimal for calculation purposes. That's done by dividing 5 by 100, which gives me 0.05.\n\n- Now, let's calculate 5% of $25,000. I multiply $25,000 by 0.05,\n  \\[\n  \\text{Commission} = 0.05 \\times 25000 = 1250\n  \\]\n\nHmm... this really seems straightforward, but let's check it and make sure I haven't made any mistakes. Yes, multiplying $25,000 by 0.05 seems correct as this is how I usually calculate percentages. So far, this seems right.\n\n**Step 3: Adding Base Salary to Commission**\n\nNext, I need to add the commission to Louis's base salary to find out his total earnings for the month.\n\n- The base salary is $1,200.\n- The commission earned is $1,250.\n\nI add these two amounts:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Earnings} = 1200 + 1250 = 2450\n\\]\n\n**Pause and Reflect:**\n\nLet's see. I first calculated the commission accurately using the sales amount and the commission rate. Then, I added this commission to the base salary. I'm just double-checking mentally \u2014 yes, all operations seem to have been conducted correctly (addition, multiplication). \n\nThe calculations seem right to me. I'm pretty confident that the total earnings calculation is correct.\n\n**Result:**\n\nLouis's total earnings for the month, with his base salary and sales commission combined, is \\$2,450.\n\nI think that covers everything. If there's anything more complicated or further calculations required, I'd tackle that next, but this solution seems complete. I'm happy that this approach worked smoothly without any need for a drastic rethink.",
