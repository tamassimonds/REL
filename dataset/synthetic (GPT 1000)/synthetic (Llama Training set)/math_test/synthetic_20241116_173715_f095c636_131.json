    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at a problem that wants me to simplify \\(\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{3}\\). Hmm, this looks like a problem involving fractions. I remember having to deal with fractions before. This feels like a problem where I need to find a common denominator. But let's pause and think...\n\nThere are generally two main strategies when adding fractions: finding a common denominator or converting to decimals. Decimal conversion might work, but it typically feels less exact and a bit more cumbersome than using common denominators. So, let me explore the common denominator approach first.\n\nWait, maybe there's a simpler way to visualize this... Imagine these fractions as parts of something, like slices of pizza. If I have a pizza divided into 6 slices, having \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) means I have one slice out of those six slices. For \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), I have a pizza divided into 3 equal parts, which means two slices if I were thinking in sixths. Aha! This means I probably need to equate their denominators.\n\nLet's decide to go with the common denominator strategy.\n\nStep-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Find the Common Denominator:**\n\n   The denominators here are 6 and 3. I need to determine the Least Common Denominator (LCD) that both 6 and 3 can divide into evenly.\n\n   - The number 6 is divisible by both 6 and 3.\n   - Awesome! 6 is our common denominator.\n\n2. **Convert Both Fractions:**\n\n   Now that I know 6 is our denominator, I want to express \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) in terms of 6. \n\n   - To convert \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) to a denominator of 6, I multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2 (since \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{2} = \\frac{2}{6}\\)).\n\n3. **Write Equivalent Fractions:**\n\n   Let's see:\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) stays as it is, since it already has the denominator of 6.\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) converts to \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\).\n\n4. **Add the Fractions:**\n\n   Now it's straightforward, since they have the same denominator:\n\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1 + 2}{6} = \\frac{3}{6}\\).\n\n5. **Simplify the Result:**\n\n   - \\( \\frac{3}{6} \\), a common fraction that can be simplified. Let's simplify it by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.\n   - \\(\\frac{3 \\div 3}{6 \\div 3} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nChecking My Work:\n\n- Quick Check: The step-by-step seems consistent, and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is logically a familiar fraction result when I summarize \\(\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n- Wait... let me think. If I visualize with pizza slices, adding one slice of six and two slices of six gives half a pizza. Yes! The arithmetic feels sensible and aligns with this practical visualization.\n\nReflections and Insights:\n\nIt seems everything checks out, and the common denominator approach was appropriate. Sometimes breaking fractions down into visual or practical terms helps ensure accuracy. \n\nThis finished solution shows the procedural work and the importance of cross-checking my steps, particularly when managing fraction operations. A satisfying conclusion\u2014honing in on the simplicity beyond the fractional addition, resulting in \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Nice!",

  "ground_truth": "We want to have the least common denominator, $6$, in the denominator when we add the two fractions. $\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{2} = \\frac{2}{6}$.\n\nAdding this to $\\frac{1}{6}$, we obtain $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{3}{6}$, which can be simplified further since $3$ and $6$ have a common divisor, $3$.  Dividing both the numerator and denominator by $3$, we find that $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which is in the most simplified form. So, $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
