I remember from previous problems that finding the multiplicative inverse \\(a^{-1} \\mod n\\) involves finding \\(x\\) such that \\(ax \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\\).\n\n### Brainstorming\n1. **Method of Approach**: We could use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 997 and 1000 first and then backtrack with the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the inverse.\n2. **Observations**: \\(997\\) is very close to \\(1000\\), which might simplify the calculations since \\(997 = 1000 - 3\\).\n\n### Steps and Calculations\n#### Step 1: Ensuring GCD is 1\n- First, check if 997 and 1000 are coprime, i.e., \\(\\gcd(997, 1000) = 1\\).\n- As 997 is a prime number and not a factor of 1000 (which is \\(2^3 \\cdot 5^3\\)), it is indeed coprime with 1000. Perfect, we can proceed.\n\n#### Step 2: Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm\n- Apply the Euclidean algorithm to find \\((997)^{-1} \\mod 1000\\).\n\n1. **Perform Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   \\[\n   1000 = 997 \\times 1 + 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   997 = 3 \\times 332 + 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3 = 1 \\times 3 + 0\n   \\]\n   - Here, the remainder reduces to 1, as expected since they are coprime. Now, backtrack to express 1 as a combination of 997 and 1000.\n\n2. **Backtrack to Express 1**:\n   - From \\(997 = 3 \\times 332 + 1\\), we have:\n     \\[\n     1 = 997 - 3 \\times 332\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\(3\\) from first step:\n     \\[\n     3 = 1000 - 997 \\times 1\n     \\]\n   - Substitute into the expression for 1:\n     \\[\n     1 = 997 - (1000 - 997) \\times 332\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     1 = 997 - 332 \\times 1000 + 332 \\times 997\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     1 = 333 \\times 997 - 332 \\times 1000\n     \\]\n   - So, the multiplicative inverse \\(x\\) is 333, where:\n     \\[\n     997 \\times 333 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}\n     \\]\n\n### Verification\n- Let me just verify this quickly:\n  \\[\n  997 \\times 333 = 332201\n  \\]\n  Now, find \\(332201 \\mod 1000\\):\n  \\[\n  332201 \\mod 1000 = 1\n  \\]\nThis confirms that \\(333\\) is indeed the inverse. \n\n### Conclusion\nSo, \\(997^{-1} \\equiv 333 \\pmod{1000}\\). Our approach seems correct, and we've confirmed the result through calculation. Everything checks out!",

  "ground_truth": "We note that $$997\\equiv -3\\pmod{1000},$$and $$(-3)\\cdot 333 = -999 = -1000+1\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}.$$Therefore, $$997\\cdot 333\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000},$$and the inverse of $997$ modulo $1000$ is $\\boxed{333}$."
