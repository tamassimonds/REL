    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and take it one step at a time. We're given the equation \\(y = 1\\) and \\(2x + 3y = 4\\) and need to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nLooking at these equations, my goal is to isolate \\(x\\). We have two pieces of information: \\(y\\) is already given as \\(1\\), and the equation \\(2x + 3y = 4\\). Immediately, it seems like a substitution method would work here. Since \\(y\\) is a constant, it becomes more straightforward. \n\n**Initial Strategy:**\n\nSince \\(y = 1\\), I can substitute this directly into the equation \\(2x + 3y = 4\\). I'm expecting this substitution to make the equation easier to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n**Substitution and Simplification:**\n\n1. Substitute \\(y = 1\\) into \\(2x + 3y = 4\\).\n   \\[\n   2x + 3(1) = 4\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   2x + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Now, to solve for \\(x\\), I need to isolate it by first getting rid of the \\(+3\\). I can do this by subtracting \\(3\\) from both sides of the equation.\n   \\[\n   2x + 3 - 3 = 4 - 3\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   2x = 1\n   \\]\n\n3. Now I need to solve for \\(x\\), which involves dividing both sides by \\(2\\).\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection and Checking:**\n\nLet's pause for a moment to ensure everything makes sense. By substituting \\(y = 1\\), we correctly simplified the equation to \\(2x = 1\\) and then found \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n**Verification:**\n\nTo double-check, substitute \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(y = 1\\) back into the original equation \\(2x + 3y = 4\\) to verify:\n\n1. Compute the left side:\n   \\[\n   2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 3(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. The left side now equals the right side of the equation. Therefore, the solution \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) is indeed correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter going through each step carefully, substituting values, and verifying the solution, we've determined that the value of \\(x\\) expressed as a common fraction is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\\). This process involved confirming that each manipulation kept the equality balanced, confirming the accuracy of our steps.",
