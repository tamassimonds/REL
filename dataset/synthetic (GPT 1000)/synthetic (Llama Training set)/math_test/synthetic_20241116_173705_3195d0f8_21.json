    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this and take it step by step, thinking out loud as we go:\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nWhoa, okay. We're looking at an equation involving exponents: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{x + 2} = 125^{-x}\\). I remember doing something similar, where to solve equations like this, matching the bases can simplify things a lot. But how do we make these bases similar? \n\n### Exploring Strategies\nFirst, let's think about those bases. \\(\\frac{1}{25}\\) and \\(125\\) seem unrelated at first glance. But wait! Both \\(25\\) and \\(125\\) are powers of \\(5\\). This could be the key to simplifying things!\n\n1. **Express \\(25\\) and \\(125\\) using powers of \\(5\\):**\n   - \\(25 = 5^2\\), so \\(\\frac{1}{25} = (5^2)^{-1} = 5^{-2}\\).\n   - \\(125 = 5^3\\).\n\nAha! Now we have our bases in terms of \\(5\\). Let's rewrite the equation with these powers.\n\n### Rewriting the Equation\n\nSubstitute the expressions for \\(\\frac{1}{25}\\) and \\(125\\) into the original equation:\n\\[\n\\left(5^{-2}\\right)^{x+2} = (5^3)^{-x}.\n\\]\n\nOkay, that looks more manageable. Next, let's simplify the exponents.\n\n### Simplifying the Equation\n\n2. **Apply the power of a power property**: \\((a^b)^c = a^{b \\cdot c}\\).\n   - For the left side: \\((5^{-2})^{x+2} = 5^{-2(x+2)} = 5^{-2x - 4}\\).\n   - For the right side: \\((5^3)^{-x} = 5^{3(-x)} = 5^{-3x}\\).\n\nAlright, let's rewrite the equation now:\n\\[\n5^{-2x - 4} = 5^{-3x}.\n\\]\n\n### Solving the Exponent Equation\n\nSince we have the same base of \\(5\\), we can equate the exponents:\n\\[\n-2x - 4 = -3x.\n\\]\n\nNow let's solve for \\(x\\):\n\n3. **Isolate \\(x\\):**\n   - First, add \\(2x\\) to both sides to start isolating \\(x\\): \n     \\[\n     -4 = -3x + 2x.\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the right side:\n     \\[\n     -4 = -x.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   - Multiply both sides by \\(-1\\) to solve for \\(x\\):\n     \\[\n     x = 4.\n     \\]\n\n### Checking the Solution\n\nWow, okay, I think \\(x = 4\\) is our solution. But let's double-check to be sure:\n\n5. **Substitute \\(x = 4\\) back into the original equation:**\n   - Left side: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{4 + 2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^6 = 25^{-6}\\).\n   - Right side: \\(125^{-4} = (5^3)^{-4} = 5^{-12}\\).\n\nBoth the left and right simplify to \\(5^{-12}\\), so \\(x = 4\\) checks out!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlright, after carefully working through and re-checking, \\(x = 4\\) is indeed the solution. Step-by-step breakdown really helped solidify this. Glad that simplifying the bases early on made things much clearer!",

  "ground_truth": "Rewriting both sides with $5$ as the base, we have $\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{x + 2} = (5^{-2})^{x+2} = 5^{-2x - 4}$, and $125^{-x} = (5^3)^{-x} = 5^{-3x}$, which means our equation is: $$5^{-2x - 4} = 5^{-3x}.$$Then, by setting the exponents equal to each other, we obtain $$-2x - 4 = -3x.$$This yields our solution $\\boxed{x = 4}$"
