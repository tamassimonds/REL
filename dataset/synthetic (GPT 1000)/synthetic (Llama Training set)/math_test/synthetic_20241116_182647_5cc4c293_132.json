    "working_out": "First, let's really understand the problem. We're trying to determine how many digits are in the sequence of numbers formed by listing all the perfect squares from 1 to 2500, inclusive. The sequence would start with \"1491625...\" representing the numbers \\(1^2, 2^2, 3^2\\), and so on, up to \\(50^2\\).\n\n### Step 1: Reflect on Initial Thoughts\n- **First Thoughts**: Okay, this seems like a counting problem where we need to determine the number of digits in each number \\(n^2\\) and then sum these digits. I immediately think of evaluating the digits' length of numbers in specific ranges. \n- **Strategy Consideration**: The squares might be growing larger as n increases, so it could be efficient to consider them in groups based on how many digits they have. I wonder if there\u2019s a pattern or formula to predict the number of digits directly from numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Determining the Number of Digits\n- **Brainstorming**: We know that the number of digits of a number \\(x\\) can be found using the formula \\( \\lfloor \\log_{10} x \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n- **Checking the Range**:\n  - For \\(n=1\\) to \\(n=9\\), \\(n^2\\) is a one-digit number.\n  - For \\(n=10\\) to \\(n=31\\), I need to check where the number becomes a three-digit number.\n  - For \\(n=32\\) to \\(n=99\\), \\(1,024\\) starts the four-digit numbers.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating Exact Digits in Each Range\n**Range 1**: \\(n = 1\\) to \\(n = 9\\).\n- These are \\(1^2, 2^2, \\ldots, 9^2\\), all are single-digit numbers: 1 to 9.\n- Number of digits = 9 numbers * 1 digit = 9 digits.\n\n**Range 2**: \\(n = 10\\) to \\(n = 31\\).\n- Calculating squares: \\(10^2 = 100\\) to \\(31^2 = 961\\).\n- Number of digits = 22 numbers * 2 digits = 44 digits.\n\n**Range 3**: \\(n = 32\\) to \\(n = 50\\).\n- Calculating squares: \\(32^2 = 1024\\) to \\(50^2 = 2500\\).\n- Number of digits = 19 numbers * 3 digits = 57 digits.\n\n### Step 4: Sum up the Total Digits\n- **Thought Process**: I add the digits from each range to find the total number of digits in the sequence.\n- Total digits = \\(9 + 44 + 57 = 110\\).\n\n### Reflection and Final Thoughts\n- **Check**: Each number and range seems correctly assigned based on the check with initial squares.\n- **Aha Moment**: Grouping the squares based on their digit count really made the process more efficient. By confirming digits as square sizes increase, my estimates are checked correctly.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Final Answer**: The total number of digits in the sequence is 110. This logical breakdown ensures we've accounted correctly for each segment of squares.\n\nThis step-by-step approach made it easier to visualize the task, ensured accurate calculations, and confirmed the digit sequences per specified ranges.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous response. Let's revisit the problem and see where I went wrong. \n\n### Re-evaluating the Problem\n\nInitially, I grouped the perfect squares into ranges based on the number of digits, but it seems there was an oversight. Let's take another look at those ranges and reassess the number of digits for each perfect square.\n\n### Brainstorming and Strategy Reevaluation\n\nTo tackle this problem again, I will redefine my approach to break down the perfect squares more accurately by their number of digits. Here's how I plan to address it:\n\n1. **Identify the Early Single-Digit Squares**: \n   The perfect squares with only one digit are \\(1^2\\), \\(2^2\\), and \\(3^2\\). That gives us 3 numbers, each contributing 1 digit.\n\n2. **Assess Two-Digit Squares**:\n   Squares like \\(4^2\\) through \\(9^2\\) yield two-digit results. Let's verify: \\(4^2 = 16\\) to \\(9^2 = 81\\), covering 6 numbers in the two-digit range.\n\n3. **Count the Three-Digit Squares**:\n   Starting from \\(10^2\\) to \\(31^2\\), these squares result in three digits. For instance, \\(10^2 = 100\\) and \\(31^2 = 961\\). Therefore, that's 22 numbers.\n\n4. **Review and Count the Four-Digit Squares**:\n   From \\(32^2\\) to \\(50^2\\), \\(32^2 = 1024\\) starts the four-digit squares up to \\(50^2 = 2500\\). That's another 19 numbers. \n\n### Recalculating the Total Number of Digits\n\nNow, calculating the total number of digits based on these revised counts:\n\n- **Single-Digit Squares**: \\(3\\) numbers \\(\\times 1\\) digit = \\(3\\) digits.\n- **Two-Digit Squares**: \\(6\\) numbers \\(\\times 2\\) digits = \\(12\\) digits.\n- **Three-Digit Squares**: \\(22\\) numbers \\(\\times 3\\) digits = \\(66\\) digits.\n- **Four-Digit Squares**: \\(19\\) numbers \\(\\times 4\\) digits = \\(76\\) digits.\n\nAdding these numbers gives the total digits:\n\n\\[ \n3 + 12 + 66 + 76 = 157 \n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReflecting on this revised approach, I see that the correct total number of digits in the sequence of perfect squares is \\(\\boxed{157}\\). By systematically verifying each range and recalculating, I've addressed the initial oversight and updated the solution accordingly. This thorough approach ensures a more accurate result by correctly grouping the perfect squares by their number of digits.",
