    "working_out": "Alright, let's get into this problem! We've got the equation \\((2x+5)(x-3)=14\\), and we're tasked with finding the sum of the possible values of \\(x\\). Here's how I'm going to brainstorm and work through this:\n\n### Initial Impressions\nThis looks like a problem involving quadratic equations. Expanding might be the way to go since the left-hand side is a product of two binomials.\n\n### Strategy Ideas\n1. **Expand the Equation**: I'm thinking expanding the given equation could simplify things and allow me to deal with a familiar quadratic equation.\n2. **Consider Factoring**: There might be a way to refactor after expansion or use some algebraic shortcut I haven\u2019t spotted yet.\n3. **Quadratic Formula**: If expansion leads to a quadratic equation, I can use the quadratic formula to find the roots.\n\n### First Steps: Expansion\nLet's start with expanding \\((2x+5)(x-3)\\):\n\n\\[\n(2x+5)(x-3) = 2x(x) + 2x(-3) + 5(x) + 5(-3)\n\\]\n\nThis expands to:\n\n\\[\n= 2x^2 - 6x + 5x - 15\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2x^2 - x - 15\n\\]\n\n### Substitute Back into the Equation\nNow our equation is:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - x - 15 = 14\n\\]\n\n### Solve for the Roots\nLet's move all terms to one side to form a standard quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - x - 15 - 14 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2x^2 - x - 29 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Check This Setup\nLet me take a moment to check that expansion and setup. Yep, everything seems to fit, so moving on to solving the quadratic.\n\n### Quadratic Formula\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nFor our equation \\(2x^2 - x - 29\\), here \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = -1\\), \\(c = -29\\).\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\):\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-1)^2 - 4(2)(-29)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 + 232 \n\\]\n\\[\n= 233\n\\]\n\nThe positive discriminant indicates there will be two distinct real solutions for \\(x\\).\n\n### Calculate the Roots\nPlug this into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{233}}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{233}}{4}\n\\]\n\n### Sum of the Roots\nFor any quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum of the roots is given by \\(-b/a\\). \n\nApplying that here:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of the roots} = \\frac{-(-1)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Final Check\nLet's pause and reflect. Our steps seem logically sound, and we've double-checked the setup and calculations at various points. Everything points to the process used being correct, and the computations align with the expectation of the quadratic formula.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe sum of the possible values of \\(x\\) for the equation \\((2x+5)(x-3) = 14\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). That seems like a reasonable output based on our methods, so I'm confident with this solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Expanding the left side of the given equation, we have $2x^2-x-15=14 \\Rightarrow 2x^2-x-29=0$. Since in a quadratic with equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ the sum of the roots is $-b/a$, the sum of the roots of the given equation is $1/2=\\boxed{.5}$."
