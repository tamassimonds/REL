    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into simplifying the expression \\((4a^2)^3\\). I'll start by exploring some strategies and noting initial thoughts.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- At a glance, this looks like an exponentiation problem. The expression \\((4a^2)^3\\) means we need to multiply \\(4a^2\\) with itself three times.\n- I recognize this resembles the form \\((x^y)^z\\), and there's a property of exponents that might be useful. I recall something about multiplying powers when an exponent is raised to another exponent.\n\n**Brainstorming Potential Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Expansion:**\n   - Expand the expression by multiplying \\(4a^2\\) with itself three times and simplify from there.\n\n2. **Properties of Exponents:**\n   - Use the multiplication rule of exponents: \\((x^y)^z = x^{y \\cdot z}\\).\n\n3. **Analyze Components Separately:**\n   - Consider multiplying numerical coefficients and variables separately before combining them.\n\nNow, let\u2019s move forward with the approach that seems the simplest and most direct after some reflection: using properties of exponents.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Exponent Property:**\n   - We know from the properties of exponents that \\((x^m)^n = x^{m \\cdot n}\\). Let\u2019s apply this rule.\n\n2. **Apply the Rule to Simplify:**\n   - We can break down the expression by separating the constants and variables. Write \\(4a^2\\) as the product of a constant and a variable term:\n     \\[\n     (4a^2)^3 = (4^1 \\cdot a^2)^3\n     \\]\n   - Applying the exponentiation rule:\n     \\[\n     (4^1 \\cdot a^2)^3 = 4^{1 \\cdot 3} \\cdot (a^2)^{3}\n     \\]\n     Simplify each part by using the rule:\n     \\[\n     4^3 \\cdot a^{2 \\cdot 3}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify Each Component:**\n   - Calculate \\(4^3\\): \n     - \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\)\n     - \\(16 \\times 4 = 64\\)\n     - So, \\(4^3 = 64\\).\n   - Simplify \\(a^{2 \\cdot 3}\\):\n     - Multiply the exponents: \\(2 \\cdot 3 = 6\\)\n     - Therefore, \\(a^{2 \\cdot 3} = a^6\\).\n\n4. **Combine the Simplified Parts:**\n   - Our expression becomes:\n     \\[\n     64a^6\n     \\]\n\n**Step-by-Step Check and Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - The calculation \\(4^3 = 64\\) looks correct by quickly running through it again.\n  - The exponent multiplication \\(a^{2 \\cdot 3} = a^6\\) seems proper based on rules for exponents.\n  \n- **Deeper Reflection:**\n  - Is the form of the final expression correct according to the original problem? Yes, simplifying \\((4a^2)^3\\) correctly transformed into its basic components, which we then recombined.\n  \n- **Final Check:**\n  - By mentally envisioning multiplying \\((4a^2)\\) by itself three times, I confirm that results align with \\(64a^6\\).\n\nOur final simplified expression is indeed \\(64a^6\\). It feels satisfying to reach a neat solution incorporating proper mathematical properties, confirmed by checks along the way.",
