    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n\nOkay, I'm looking at a geometric sequence: 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ... The values are clearly getting smaller. Geometric sequences have a constant ratio between terms, so I should identify this ratio first. My guess is that each term seems to be half of the previous one. \n\nIdentify the Common Ratio:\n\nLet me check if that's correct by dividing the second term by the first term: \n\\( \\frac{1/2}{1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nLooks like the ratio \\( r = \\frac{1}{2} \\). Let's confirm with another pair:\n\\( \\frac{1/4}{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nThat works, and similarly, for the next pair:\n\\( \\frac{1/8}{1/4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nOkay, confident here. The pattern is clear: multiply by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) each time.\n\nFinding the Next Two Terms:\n\nNow, the objective is to find the sum of the next two terms in the sequence. Let's calculate these terms one by one.\n\n1. Starting from the last known term (\\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)), let's calculate the next:\n   - Next term: \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{16} \\).\n\n2. Now, find the term after that:\n   - Following term: \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{32} \\).\n\nAlways good to double-check:\n- We're multiplying by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) consistently, and these calculations seem straightforward.\n\nCalculating the Sum:\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of these two terms:\n\nSum = \\( \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{32} \\).\n\nLet's get a common denominator to add these fractions:\n- The least common denominator of 16 and 32 is 32.\n\nSo we convert \\( \\frac{1}{16} \\) to a denominator of 32:\n\\( \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{2}{32} \\).\n\nAdd them:\n\\[ \\frac{2}{32} + \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{3}{32} \\].\n\nFinal Check:\n\nReflecting on the solution: \n- We've consistently applied the common ratio.\n- Calculated directly based on the pattern of the sequence.\n- Used basic fraction addition correctly.\n\nThe solution sticks. Final sum = \\( \\frac{3}{32} \\).\n\nSo, the sum of the next two terms in this geometric sequence is \\( \\frac{3}{32} \\). This solution looks solid based on the steps and checks we've completed.",
