    "working_out": "Alright, this looks like an interesting problem to tackle. Let's start by fully understanding the problem and then explore how to solve it.\n\n### First Thoughts:\n\nThe problem states that the sum of two numbers, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), is 153, and the ratio \\( \\frac{x}{y} = 0.7 \\). We're tasked with finding \\( y - x \\).\n\nAt a glance, this seems like something involving basic algebra. I'm reminded of past problems where we had to express one variable in terms of another using given conditions. In this case, we could potentially substitute or set up a system of equations. It's straightforward, yet care is needed to not overlook simple mistakes.\n\n#### Initial Exploration:\n1. **Equations Given:**\n   - \\( x + y = 153 \\)\n   - \\( \\frac{x}{y} = 0.7 \\)\n\n2. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We can express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) or vice versa using the ratio \\( \\frac{x}{y} \\).\n   - Then substitute that into the sum equation to solve for the variables.\n   - Finally, calculate \\( y - x \\).\n\nHmm, given this setup, substituting \\( y \\) or \\( x \\) by expressing it with one variable might be the way to go. Let's dive deeper into this method.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) using the ratio:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{y} = 0.7 \\implies x = 0.7y\n   \\]\n\n   - Does this seem reasonable? Yeah, we can substitute this into the other equation.\n\n2. **Substitute \\( x = 0.7y \\) into \\( x + y = 153 \\):**\n   \\[\n   0.7y + y = 153\n   \\]\n\n   - Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   1.7y = 153\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( y \\):**\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{153}{1.7}\n   \\]\n\n   - Quick Comfort Check: Does the division make sense? Multiplying 1.7 close to 90 gives a number just about right for this approximation method.\n   - Actual Calculation: \n   \\[\n   y = 90\n   \\]\n   \n   - This passes my quick sanity check. Let's get \\( x \\) next.\n\n4. **Substitute \\( y = 90 \\) to find \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 0.7 \\times 90\n   \\]\n\n   - Call on mental math here: \\( x = 63 \\).\n\n5. **Verify:**\n   - Check Both Values: \\( x = 63 \\), \\( y = 90 \\)\n   - Verify they sum correctly: \\( x + y = 63 + 90 = 153 \\). Perfect.\n\n   - Check the fraction: \\( \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{63}{90} \\Rightarrow 0.7 \\). This matches the condition given.\n\nSeems like we're on the correct path.\n\n6. **Calculate \\( y - x \\):**\n   \\[\n   y - x = 90 - 63 = 27\n   \\]\n\n### Final Insight and Conclusion:\n\nAfter walking through these steps methodically, I\u2019m confident in the result. The calculations align well with the conditions, and the logic is sound. A quick revisit shows no glaring arithmetic mistakes. Thus, the value of \\( y - x \\) is \\(\\boxed{27}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We have the system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 153 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{y} &= 0.7 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the second equation, multiplying both sides by $y$ gives $x=.7y$. Next, substituting the second equation into the first to eliminate $x$ gives $.7y+y=153$, or $y=90$. Plugging in this value into the first equation in the original system of equations gives $x+90=153$ or $x=63$. Thus, $y-x=90-63=\\boxed{27}$."
