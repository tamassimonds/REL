    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\n- Okay, this looks like a simple addition of fractions problem. But wait, I need to make sure I understand the question properly. Louis eats \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the pie, and Jack eats \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the pie. I need to find out the total amount of the pie they eat together.\n- So, in essence, I'm looking to add two fractions: \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nBrainstorming Strategies:\n\n- Maybe I could find the total they eat by directly adding the fractions. However, I know fractions require a common denominator to be added.\n- The denominators here are 5 and 3. Hmm, what is the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 3? \n\nExploring LCM:\n\n- Let's quickly list out the multiples of each number to find the LCM.\n  - Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, ...\n  - Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, ...\n- Ah, they both share 15 as a common multiple, and it's the smallest one. So, 15 is our LCM.\n\nConverting Fractions:\n\n- I need to convert each fraction to have a denominator of 15.\n- For \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\): What do I multiply the denominator (5) by to get 15? It's 3. So, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3, giving \\(\\frac{3}{15}\\).\n- For \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\): What do I multiply 3 by to get 15? It's 5. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 5, giving \\(\\frac{10}{15}\\).\n\nAdding the Fractions:\n\n- Now that both fractions have the same denominator of 15, I can add them directly.\n- \\(\\frac{3}{15} + \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{3 + 10}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}\\).\n\nReflecting:\n\n- Wait, let me take a moment to check if this addition makes sense. Both fractions were appropriately converted to have a common denominator, and the arithmetic looks right.\n- \\(\\frac{13}{15}\\) also seems reasonable considering they both didn't eat the entire pie. It's comforting to see the result is less than 1, which means they did not eat more than the pie available. \n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\n- The problem's requirement is addressed, and the steps seem solid. I'll quickly mentally recap: After finding a common denominator, I converted and added the fractions correctly.\n- Yay! It seems the total amount of pie eaten by Louis and Jack together is \\(\\frac{13}{15}\\).\n\nNow I feel confident about my solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The denominators $5$ and $3$ have a common multiple of $15$.  We use this to write $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot \\frac{3}{3}=\\frac{3}{15}$ and $\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot \\frac{5}{5}=\\frac{10}{15}$.  Then, we can add the fractions by adding the numerators and keeping the denominator.  We have $$\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{3}{15}+\\frac{10}{15}=\\frac{3+10}{15}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{15}}.$$"
