    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step. Let me begin by understanding what is being asked here.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe have an operation denoted by $(a)$ x $(b) = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$. This expression looks very familiar. Hmm, actually, it reminds me of the algebraic expansion of a binomial square: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \n\n### Initial Observations\nSo, effectively, $(a)$ x $(b)$ is the same as evaluating \\((a + b)^2\\) for given values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Now the task becomes simply substituting the values of \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 5\\) into this formula.\n\n### Calculations Step-by-Step\n1. **Substitute the Values**: \n   \\[\n   (a) \\times (b) = (3)^2 + 2(3)(5) + (5)^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Each Part**: \n   - Calculate \\(3^2\\), which is \\(9\\).\n   - Calculate \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5\\), which is \\(30\\).\n   - Calculate \\(5^2\\), which is \\(25\\).\n\n3. **Add the Results**:\n   - Add these results together: \\(9 + 30 + 25\\).\n\n4. **Perform the Addition**: \n   - First, \\(9 + 30 = 39\\).\n   - Then, add \\(25\\): \\(39 + 25 = 64\\).\n\n### Reflecting on the Approach\nThe method I used makes sense because it directly applies the definition given in the problem as well as recognizes a common mathematical pattern with binomial squares. The calculations seem straightforward, and I've double-checked the arithmetic:\n\n- \\(9\\) from \\(3^2\\)\n- \\(30\\) from \\(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5\\)\n- \\(25\\) from \\(5^2\\)\n- Sum: \\(64\\)\n\n### Confirmation\nFinally, by recognizing that the problem uses the form of a binomial square, the ease of substitution and calculation confirms that \\((a)\\ x\\ (b) = (3 + 5)^2 = 8^2 = 64\\) achieves the expected result. This approach feels correct and complete.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe value of \\((a)\\ x\\ (b)\\) when \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 5\\) is \\(64\\).\n\nThis problem was solved by recognizing the algebraic identity and performing straightforward arithmetic, ensuring each calculation is correct. The familiar pattern significantly simplified the task!",
