    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, letting my thoughts flow naturally and exploring different strategies as I go.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe problem asks for the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4. My first thought is, \"Okay, the Fibonacci sequence is something I'm familiar with: 1, 1, 2, 3, etc., where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.\" Let's think about what happens when we divide Fibonacci numbers by 4. It feels like there might be a pattern here.\n\n### Step 2: Generate Initial Terms\nI want to brainstorm and see if a pattern emerges by generating the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4:\n\n- **F1 = 1** (1 % 4 = 1)\n- **F2 = 1** (1 % 4 = 1)\n- **F3 = 2** (2 % 4 = 2)\n- **F4 = 3** (3 % 4 = 3)\n- **F5 = 5** (5 % 4 = 1)\n- **F6 = 8** (8 % 4 = 0)\n- **F7 = 13** (13 % 4 = 1)\n- **F8 = 21** (21 % 4 = 1)\n- **F9 = 34** (34 % 4 = 2)\n- **F10 = 55** (55 % 4 = 3)\n\n### Step 3: Look for Patterns\nNow, I want to look for patterns or repetitions since Fibonacci sequences often have cyclic properties with respect to modulus:\n\n- The sequence modulo 4 looks like:\n  - 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3...\n\nWait, I'm seeing something interesting! There seems to be a cycle here, especially from F5 onwards:\n- **Cycle**: 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Cycle\nLet's confirm this cycle by extending the sequence a bit further:\n\n- **F11 = 89** (89 % 4 = 1)\n- **F12 = 144** (144 % 4 = 0)\n- **F13 = 233** (233 % 4 = 1)\n- ...\n\nThe cycle of length 6 (1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3) appears to be repeating!\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Remainder for F100\nNow that I can see a clear repeating pattern every 6 numbers, I'll compute the position of the 100th Fibonacci number within this cycle. \n\nWe calculate the position in the cycle by using:\n\\[ 100 \\mod 6 = 4 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Find the Corresponding Value in the Cycle\nThe result shows that the 100th Fibonacci number corresponds to the 4th number in the cycle (since the remainder 4 corresponds to the sequence position). So, refer back to the cycle: **1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3**.\n\n- The 4th number in the cycle is **3**.\n\n### Step 7: Check and Conclude\nLet's do a quick check to ensure this cycle is consistent:\n- Every 6th number indeed seems to repeat the pattern, as confirmed by checking mod values beyond F12. I'm confident in my calculated cycle.\n\nThus, the remainder when the 100th Fibonacci number is divided by 4 is **3**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is **3**. This feels right based on the cycle I identified. That was a fun exploration into the cyclic nature of Fibonacci numbers under modulus!",

  "ground_truth": "If we look at the terms of the sequence mod 4, we see that they follow a pattern of period 6: \\begin{align*}\nF_1 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_2 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_3 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_4 &\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_5 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_6 &\\equiv 0\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_7 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_8 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4},~\\ldots\n\\end{align*} Then we see that the terms repeat.  Therefore, the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term is the same as the $4^{\\text{th}}$ term, and thus has a remainder of $\\boxed{3}$ when divided by 4."
