    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with an exploratory mindset.\n\n### First Thoughts:\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, I immediately recognize that it involves complex numbers. The term \\({-4+ti}\\) is a complex number where the real part is \\(-4\\) and the imaginary part is \\(t\\). The modulus (or absolute value) of this complex number is given to be 6. This reminds me of the formula for the modulus of a complex number \\(a + bi\\), which is \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).\n\n### Exploring Solutions:\n\n1. **Understanding the Formula**:\n   - The modulus \\(|a + bi|\\) is \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\). So here, \\(|{-4 + ti}| = 6\\) means \\(\\sqrt{(-4)^2 + t^2} = 6\\).\n   - This equation can be rewritten as \\(\\sqrt{16 + t^2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Solving the Equation**:\n   - I need to get rid of the square root to simplify this, so I'll square both sides. This gives us:\n     \\[\n     16 + t^2 = 36\n     \\]\n   - Now, I need to solve for \\(t^2\\). By subtracting 16 from both sides, I get:\n     \\[\n     t^2 = 20\n     \\]\n\n3. **Finding \\(t\\)**:\n   - To find \\(t\\), I'll take the square root of both sides. This gives:\n     \\[\n     t = \\sqrt{20}\n     \\]\n   - I realize now that \\(\\sqrt{20}\\) simplifies to \\(\\sqrt{4 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{4} \\times \\sqrt{5} = 2\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n4. **Reflecting on the Solution**:\n   - The problem asks for a positive value of \\(t\\), and \\(t = 2\\sqrt{5}\\) is positive, so this satisfies the condition.\n   - Let me quickly verify by plugging back to check: If \\(t = 2\\sqrt{5}\\), then \\(t^2 = 20\\), which matches our equation \\(16 + t^2 = 36\\).\n\n### Quick Checks:\n\n- It looks like our work is solid. The calculation holds up, and during plugging back to check, we didn't find any discrepancies.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe positive value of \\(t\\) that satisfies the condition \\(|{-4+ti}| = 6\\) is \\(t = 2\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\nI've explored and cross-validated this step by step, catching the necessary checking points, and I am confident in this result.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $|{-4+ti}| = \\sqrt{(-4)^2 + t^2} = \\sqrt{t^2+16}$, the equation $|{-4+ti}| = 6$ tells us that $\\sqrt{t^2 + 16} = 6$.  Squaring both sides gives $t^2 + 16= 36$, so $t^2= 20$.  Since we want the positive value of $t$, we have $t = \\boxed{2\\sqrt5}$."
