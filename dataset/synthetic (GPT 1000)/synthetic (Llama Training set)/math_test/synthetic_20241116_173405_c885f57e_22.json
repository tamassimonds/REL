    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem. We are asked to rewrite \\(5x - |x - 5|\\) without using absolute value signs, given that \\(x < 5\\). Here's how I'll approach it step-by-step:\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n1. **Understanding Absolute Values**: Absolute values represent the distance from zero, meaning they're always non-negative. For an expression like \\(|x - 5|\\), it splits into two cases depending on the sign of \\(x - 5\\).\n\n2. **Given Condition Insight**: We have the condition \\(x < 5\\). This is crucial because it tells us about the sign of \\(x - 5\\). If \\(x < 5\\), then \\(x - 5\\) is negative.\n\n### Break It Down:\n\n1. **Exploring the Absolute Value**:\n   - Since \\(x < 5\\), the expression \\(x - 5\\) is negative.\n   - By definition, \\(|x - 5| = -(x - 5)\\) because we're negating a negative result to make it positive.\n\n2. **Substituting the Expression**:\n   - Substitute the expression for the absolute value into the original equation:\n   \\[ 5x - |x - 5| = 5x - (-(x - 5)) \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying**:\n   - Distribute the negative sign in the expression:\n   \\[ 5x - (-(x - 5)) = 5x + x - 5 \\]\n\n4. **Combining Like Terms**:\n   - Combine the terms to simplify further:\n   \\[ 5x + x - 5 = 6x - 5 \\]\n\n### Reflecting & Checking:\n- **Does the Result Make Sense?**: Yes, given the condition \\(x < 5\\), our simplification is viable and respects the rule of absolute values.\n- **Quick Numerical Check**: Pick a value less than 5, say \\(x = 4\\). Originally, \\(5(4) - |4 - 5| = 20 - 1 = 19\\). With our expression \\(6(4) - 5 = 24 - 5 = 19\\), it matches!\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy analyzing the absolute value and substituting based on the condition, we've simplified the expression correctly for \\(x < 5\\). \n\nThe final expression without absolute value signs is:\n\\[ 6x - 5 \\]\n\nThis problem reinforced that breaking down conditions and transforming expressions under those specific regimes can simplify complex-looking problems!",

  "ground_truth": "Since $x<5,$ $x-5<0.$ It follows that $|x-5|=-(x-5),$ and the equation can be simplified as  \\[5x-|x-5|=5x+(x-5)=\\boxed{6x-5}.\\]"
