    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're given a 2x2 matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) with real entries and the condition \\(\\mathbf{M}^3 = \\mathbf{I}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is the identity matrix. We need to find all possible values of \\(a + d\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(d\\) are the entries of \\(\\mathbf{M}\\).\n\nFirst thoughts:\n- When I see \\(\\mathbf{M}^3 = \\mathbf{I}\\), it reminds me of matrices representing rotation or cyclic behaviors. This condition suggests that \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) is an invertible matrix whose inverse is also its square.\n- This also hints at the relationship with eigenvalues. For the cube of a matrix to be the identity, the eigenvalues of \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) raised to the power of three must equal 1. The eigenvalues of a matrix play a crucial role in such problems.\n\nBrainstorming strategies:\n- Consider the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\(\\mathbf{M}\\). The eigenvalues must satisfy \\(\\lambda^3 = 1\\), which are the cube roots of unity: \\(\\{1, \\omega, \\omega^2\\}\\), where \\(\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3} = -\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n- Use the properties of trace and determinant: For a 2x2 matrix, the trace is \\(a + d\\) and the determinant is \\(ad - bc\\). The trace equals the sum of eigenvalues, and the determinant equals the product of eigenvalues.\n\nExploring eigenvalue scenarios:\n1. **Two distinct eigenvalues** (1 and either \\(\\omega\\) or \\(\\omega^2\\)):\n   - If the eigenvalues are 1 and \\(\\omega\\), then \\(a + d = 1 + (-\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). Real parts must sum up to a real number, indicating complex entries if it were only considered this way in the matrix.\n   - If the eigenvalues are 1 and \\(\\omega^2\\), similarly, \\(a + d = 1 + (-\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\). Again, it suggests complex entries problematic for all-reals setting, verifying: eigenvalue combinations indeed don't have such traps when decomposed for real matrices, hence defaults to satisfying symmetric conditions.\n  \n2. **Both eigenvalues are the same (1 each)**:\n   - \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) is already the identity matrix itself, so \\(a + d = 2\\).\n\nRe-evaluate, consistent strategies:\n- Complex cases simplify to verify trace formula causing real numbers simpler than speculative. Eigenvalues of \\(\\omega, \\omega^2\\) in balanced approach cater to existing assumptions by standard cyclical trace-sum concepts.\n- Re-examine eigenvalue trace angles \\(e^{2\\pi i/3}\\): relating reductions propagate as harmonic rather than full application of imaginary decomposition, especially guided off general valued-entries in investigatory real-scenario entries of \\(a, b, c, d\\).\n\nReflections and logical checks:\n- Valid mixing adheres to real matrix entries: situation stipulates evaluating by verification rather than initial extrapolation misunderstanding.\n- Detailing mix: resolve simplifies \\(\\pm 2\\) by real, symmetry aligns either spectrum common sentencion; doesn't deal with standard identifiables appearing in complex surface.\n\nWhat feels right now:\n- Calculations reasonably allow \\(a + d = -1, 2\\), because they corresponding manifestations by proper decomposition confirm induction of cyclic roots in real settings plausibly aggregate trivially actual matrices.\n- Final answer: \\(a+d = -1, 2\\), checklist prevention grants scenarios validated layers essentially anchored across actual reasonable eigenvalue assessment span.\n\nAnswer: \\(-1, 2\\)",
