    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The goal is to understand how many ways we can place 5 indistinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. First, I'll try to break down the problem and reflect on possible strategies.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- This is a partition problem because the balls are indistinguishable. That already simplifies things as it's not about arranging the balls but dividing them into groups.\n- The boxes being indistinguishable adds another layer because it reduces distinct arrangements further. If the boxes were distinguishable, we'd have more combinations.\n- Okay, I think this looks somewhat similar to combinations and partitioning problems I've seen before. Let's explore possible strategies.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Listing Possibilities:**\n   - Start considering how balls can be split into boxes.\n   - Since boxes are indistinguishable, permutations like (5,0) and (0,5) would be treated the same.\n\n2. **Using Combinatorics:**\n   - Partitions of numbers come to mind; specifically, how to partition the number 5 using parts.\n   - Since only 2 boxes, the partitions of directly interest should sum to 5.\n\n3. **Direct Counting or Formula-Based:**\n   - Maybe there's a formula for this scenario if I remember correctly. Need to check my knowledge on combinations of indistinguishable objects into indistinguishable bins.\n\n**Approach to Solve:**\n\n- Let's start by **listing the partitions** because that feels straightforward especially if the numbers aren't enormous.\n\n1. **Listing Partitions:**\n\n   Okay, considering 5 indistinguishable balls, we only differentiate them by count in each box:\n   \n   - All balls in one box: (5, 0)\n   - 4 in one box, 1 in the other: (4, 1)\n   - 3 in one box, 2 in the other: (3, 2)\n\n2. **Checking for Indistinctness:**\n\n   - Since boxes are indistinguishable, (a, b) is the same as (b, a), so each of the above counts once.\n\n3. **Reflect on Correctness:**\n\n   Wait, that seems too quick \u2013 check:\n   \n   - (5,0): Only one way, as mentioned.\n   - (4,1): Right, similar to (1,4).\n   - (3,2): Also straightforward.\n   - That sums to three distinct outcomes.\n\n4. **Double-Check:**\n\n   - Yup, given everything is indistinguishable once arranged as partitions, indistinguishable transformations would fit described allocations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThus, the problem simplifies nicely due to the indistinctions, confirming there are **3 ways** to arrange the balls into the two boxes without worrying about permutations. This seems reasonable upon deeper checking using thought processes above.\n\nThat satisfies the problem under given constraints of indistinct objects and collections. Great!",
