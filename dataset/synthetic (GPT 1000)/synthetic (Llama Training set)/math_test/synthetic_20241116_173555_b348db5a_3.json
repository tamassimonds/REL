The problem states the volume of a cube is 0.027 cubic meters, and we need to find its surface area in square meters. Cubes are symmetrical and straightforward in their geometrical properties, so I think this shouldn't be too complicated.\n\n- **Volume of a Cube**: The formula for the volume of a cube is \\(V = s^3\\), where \\(s\\) is the length of a side of the cube. This makes sense because multiplying the length of the cube's sides gives you the total space it occupies.\n\n- **Surface Area of a Cube**: The surface area of a cube is given by \\(A = 6s^2\\), as there are 6 equally sized square faces on a cube.\n\n### Step 1: Find the Side Length\n\nFirst, we need to determine the side length using the volume. \n\n\\[\nV = s^3 = 0.027\n\\]\n\nTo get \\(s\\), we'll take the cube root of both sides. Let's calculate that:\n\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt[3]{0.027}\n\\]\n\nLet me think about this: I know that \\(0.027\\) seems like a small number, and if I recall correctly, \\(0.027\\) is \\(3^3 \\times 10^{-3}\\), so I think \\(s\\) might be \\(0.3\\).\n\nTo break down this calculation:\n\n- \\(27\\) is \\(3^3\\), so \\(0.027 = 0.3^3\\)\n- Therefore, the cube root of \\(0.027\\) is \\(0.3\\)\n\nAlright, I have \\(s = 0.3\\) meters.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Surface Area\n\nWith the side length \\(s\\) now known, let's find the surface area.\n\n\\[\nA = 6s^2 = 6 \\times (0.3)^2\n\\]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n1. Calculate \\(s^2\\):\n   \\[\n   s^2 = (0.3)^2 = 0.09\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply by 6 to get the surface area:\n   \\[\n   A = 6 \\times 0.09 = 0.54\n   \\]\n\nSo, the surface area of the cube is \\(0.54\\) square meters.\n\n### Double-checking the Work\n\nLet's take a moment to ensure everything is logical.\n\n- The volume \\(0.027\\) and side \\(0.3\\) check out as \\(0.3^3 = 0.027\\).\n- For surface area, \\(6 \\times 0.09 = 0.54\\) seems right.\n\nThis approach seems correct, as the calculations align with the geometric principles of a cube.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the volume of the cube is \\(0.027\\) cubic meters, the surface area works out to \\(0.54\\) square meters. This makes sense because the steps were followed logically and the arithmetic checks out.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $s$ be the side length of the cube. Then $s^3$ is the volume, so $s^3 = .027$. Taking the cube root of both sides gives $s = .3$. The area of one face of the cube is thus $s^2 = .09$. There are six faces, so the surface area is $6(.09) = \\boxed{0.54}$ square meters."
