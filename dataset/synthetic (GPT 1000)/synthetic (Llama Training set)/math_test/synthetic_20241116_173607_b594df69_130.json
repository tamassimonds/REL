    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this question step by step, and I'll try to make it as human-like as possible with all the messy thinking included!\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: We're dealing with a probability problem involving a standard 52-card deck. We need to find the probability that three randomly chosen cards are not all the same color. \n\n- Standard deck: 52 cards, evenly split into black (clubs/spades) and red (hearts/diamonds).\n- Key term: \"not all the same color.\" This means we only need at least one card of a different color.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Approach Strategies\n\nStrategy 1: Find the probability that they are all the same color and subtract from 1.\n\nStrategy 2: Directly compute the probability of at least one card being a different color.\n\nStrategy 1 seems a bit simpler off the bat because dealing with \"not\" usually involves complement probabilities, which often simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Complement Probability\n\nOk, let's start with the complement:\n\n- **Probability that all three cards are the same color (either all red or all black).**\n\nCalculation for all red:\n- There are 26 red cards.\n- Probability of first card being red = 26/52.\n- Probability of second card being red = 25/51.\n- Probability of third card being red = 24/50.\n\nSo, the probability that all three cards are red:\n\\[ P(\\text{3 Reds}) = \\frac{26}{52} \\times \\frac{25}{51} \\times \\frac{24}{50} \\]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\\[ P(\\text{3 Reds}) = \\frac{26 \\times 25 \\times 24}{52 \\times 51 \\times 50} \\]\n\nWait, simplify these fractions before I do more calculations... \n- 26/52 simplifies to 1/2.\n\nSo:\n\\[ P(\\text{3 Reds}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{25}{51} \\times \\frac{24}{50} \\]\n\nAlright, now multiply it out:\n\\[ P(\\text{3 Reds}) = \\frac{1 \\times 25 \\times 24}{2 \\times 51 \\times 50} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{600}{5100} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{2}{17} \\]\n\nRepeat the same for black cards: Probability is the same because the deck is symmetric.\n\nSo:\n\\[ P(\\text{3 Blacks}) = \\frac{2}{17} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Total Probability of the Compliment Event\n\nTotal probability of three cards being the same color (either all red or all black):\n\\[ P(\\text{All Same Color}) = P(\\text{3 Reds}) + P(\\text{3 Blacks}) \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{2}{17} + \\frac{2}{17} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{4}{17} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Desired Probability\n\nDesired probability:\n\\[ P(\\text{Not All Same Color}) = 1 - P(\\text{All Same Color}) \\]\n\\[ = 1 - \\frac{4}{17} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{17 - 4}{17} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{13}{17} \\]\n\n### Step 6: Verification\n\nQuick check: This matches my expectations:\n\n- If the cards are not all the same color, it means there's a mix of colors, which feels like it should be more likely than a perfectly uniform selection in a shuffled deck.\n  \nAlright, seems to make sense. Everything looks good; the final answer is:\n\n**The probability that they are not all the same color is \\(\\frac{13}{17}\\).**",

  "ground_truth": "We can find the probability they are all same color, then subtract that from 1. There are 26 cards of each color, so 3 of them can be selected in $\\binom{26}{3}$ ways, and of course there are 2 colors.  So the answer is \\[1-2\\frac{\\binom{26}{3}}{\\binom{52}{3}}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{17}}.\\]"
