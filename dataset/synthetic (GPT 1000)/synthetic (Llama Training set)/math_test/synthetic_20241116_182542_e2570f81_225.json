    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. \n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It says we need to find how many values \\(k\\) can take such that the congruence equation \\(3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6}\\) has no solutions in \\(x\\). \n\n\\(k\\) is a positive integer less than 6, so \\(k\\) can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Our task is to determine for which values of \\(k\\) this congruence has no solutions. \n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Congruence \\(3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6}\\)\n\nOkay, let's think about what it means for \\(3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6}\\) to have solutions. We can phrase this as \"Can we find an integer \\(x\\) such that when you multiply by 3 and take modulo 6, you get \\(k\\)?\"\n\nI'm remembering that when dealing with congruences of the form \\(ax \\equiv b \\pmod{n}\\), the equation has solutions if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) divides \\(b\\). Here we have:\n\n- \\(a = 3\\)\n- \\(n = 6\\)\n- hence, \\(\\gcd(3, 6) = 3\\)\n\nFor \\(3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6}\\) to have solutions, \\(3\\) should divide \\(k\\). \n\n### Step 3: Check Divisibility Condition\n\nThis divisibility condition simplifies the problem. Next, I should check which integers less than 6 are divisible by 3:\n\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(3\\) does not divide \\(1\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(3\\) does not divide \\(2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(3\\) divides \\(3\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(3\\) does not divide \\(4\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\): \\(3\\) does not divide \\(5\\)\n\nA realization: The numbers \\(k = 3\\) is the only one for which \\(3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6}\\) has solutions. \n\n### Step 4: Solution Verification\n\nThe problem asks how many values \\(k\\) can take such that there are no solutions. We've found that except for \\(k = 3\\), all other cases have no solutions because 3 does not divide those values of \\(k\\).\n\nSo, count the values without solutions: 1, 2, 4, and 5. That makes four values.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the number of values \\(k\\) can take so that \\(3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6}\\) has no solutions is **4**.\n\nGoing through everything carefully has made me confident in this answer. Each step logically flows from the previous one, and following through on each \\(k\\) option confirms the count. \n\nFinal answer: **4** values.",

  "ground_truth": "Note that the left-hand side is divisible by 3. Therefore, since 3 divides 6, the left-hand side will be equivalent to a multiple of 3. Therefore, if $k$ were to be 1, 2, 4, or 5, then the given congruence would have no solutions. On the other hand, if $k=0$ or $k=3$, then $x=0$ and $x=1$ (respectively) satisfy the given congruence. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ values of $k$ such that $3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6}$ has no solutions."
