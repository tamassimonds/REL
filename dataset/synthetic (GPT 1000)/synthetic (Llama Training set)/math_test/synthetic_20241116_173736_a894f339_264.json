    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem about figuring out what day of the week Carlos will be when he is 706 days old. This seems like a problem involving calculating the days and understanding the calendar.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Carlos Montado was born on Saturday, November 9, 2002. I need to figure out what day it will be exactly 706 days after this date.\n- My initial idea is to calculate the date 706 days past November 9, 2002, and determine the day of the week for that date.\n- This reminds me of similar date calculation problems I've done before, where I've needed to account for leap years and varying days in different months.\n- One approach could be to count each day out but that seems inefficient. We should use the fact that weeks repeat every 7 days.\n\n**Step-by-Step Strategy Brainstorm:**\n\n1. **Determine Number of Full Weeks and Remaining Days:**\n   - Since days of the week repeat every 7 days, dividing 706 by 7 should give insights into the remainder, which directly affects the day of the week.\n   \n2. **Account for Leap Year Adjustments:**\n   - Leap years might adjust the day count as one additional day would come into play. Check whether this interval includes any leap years.\n   \n3. **Step through Years and Months:**\n   - It might be wise to step through year by year or month by month to ensure we consider month lengths. This could get tricky if not handled logically.\n\n**Perform Calculations:** \n\n1. **Divide 706 by 7 to Find Weeks and Remainder:**\n   - Calculation: \\( 706 \\div 7 = 100 \\text{ weeks} \\text{ remainder } 6 \\).\n   - 100 weeks don't affect the day of the week, so the question is equivalent to finding the day of the week 6 days after November 9, 2002, a Saturday.\n\n2. **Add 6 Days:**\n   - Starting from Saturday, 6 days ahead would be Friday. Here's the quick check: \n     - Saturday (Day 0)\n     - Sunday (Day 1)\n     - Monday (Day 2)\n     - Tuesday (Day 3)\n     - Wednesday (Day 4)\n     - Thursday (Day 5)\n     - Friday (Day 6)\n\n3. **Leap Year Check:**\n   - From 2002 to 2004 includes 2004, which is a leap year adding one extra day.\n   - However, since I calculated directly for 706 days by division, the extra day already got adjusted into longer spans like months and weeks, especially for leap years interrupting after an exact number of full weeks.\n\n**Final Thought and Answer:**\n\nAfter considering leap years and dividing for weeks and remainder, and counting sequentially by days within a week, the day on which Carlos turns 706 days old is **Friday**. \n\nLet's confirm: Starting on Saturday, 6 days in the same weekly cycle is logically a Friday without further interference. Calculations rechecked, this logic holds. The day of the week Carlos is 706 days old is **Friday**.",
