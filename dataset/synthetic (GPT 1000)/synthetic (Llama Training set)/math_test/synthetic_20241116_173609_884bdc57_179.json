    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and break it down step by step. I'll start by thinking out loud and considering different approaches.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- **Grasping the Question:** The equation given is \\( z = c \\) in cylindrical coordinates. I'm familiar with cylindrical coordinates \\((r, \\theta, z)\\), where:\n  - \\( r \\) is the radial distance from the \\( z \\)-axis.\n  - \\( \\theta \\) is the angular coordinate around the \\( z \\)-axis.\n  - \\( z \\) is the height or the vertical position.\n  \n  The equation \\( z = c \\) means that the z-coordinate is constant.\n\n- **Similar Problems:** This feels similar to problems where sections in 3D space are determined. In Cartesian coordinates, \\( z = c \\) is a plane parallel to the \\( xy \\)-plane. Ok, this is giving me some clues.\n\n### Exploring the Equation\n\n- **What Does \\( z = c \\) Describe?** Since \\( z \\) is constant, \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\) can vary freely. How does this look in 3D?\n  - Imagine fixing \\( z \\) at a specific height, say \"c,\" and allowing \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\) to vary:\n  - As \\( r \\) changes from \\( 0 \\) to \\(\\infty\\), and \\(\\theta\\) from \\( 0 \\) to \\(2\\pi\\), it covers an entire plane parallel to the xy-plane at height \\( z = c \\).\n\n### Reflecting on the Solution\n\n- **Does It Align with a Plane?** Yes, it aligns perfectly. One horizontal cross-section of constant \\( z \\) in the cylindrical coordinate system forms a plane parallel to the base (xy-plane).\n\n### Checking for Mistakes or Aha Moments\n\n- **Quick Verification:** If my understanding was wrong, changing my perspective might help.\n  - I recalled that \\( r = \\) constant circles around the \\( z \\)-axis, and \\( \\theta = \\) constant describes radial lines, so \\( z = \\) constant purely holds the plane aspect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Given I\u2019ve verified how the concept applies in Cartesian, and reflected on the cylinder components, it feels right that:\n  - The answer is (C) Plane.\n\nThis thought process, though it led to a fairly straightforward conclusion, was essential for making sure I covered different angles and possible misunderstandings.",
