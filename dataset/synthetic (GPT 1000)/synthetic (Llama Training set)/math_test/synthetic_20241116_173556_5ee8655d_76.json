    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nWhen I first read the question, it seems to be asking for values of \\( c \\) in the quadratic equation \\( 3x^2 + 7x + c = 0 \\) that result in two real roots. This has something to do with the discriminant of a quadratic equation. For a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the roots are real if the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) is non-negative.\n\n### Brainstorming\n\n- The problem mentions finding positive integer values of \\( c \\), suggesting that \\( c \\) needs to be a positive integer for the equation to have real roots.\n- We need the discriminant \\( 49 - 12c \\) (since \\( b = 7 \\) and \\( a = 3 \\)) to be non-negative for the quadratic to have real roots: \\( 49 - 12c \\geq 0 \\).\n\n### Working Through It\n\n1. **Set up the inequality**:\n\n   \\[\n   49 - 12c \\geq 0\n   \\]\n\n   Rearrange it to:\n\n   \\[\n   49 \\geq 12c \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c \\leq \\frac{49}{12}\n   \\]\n\n   Calculating gives:\n\n   \\[\n   c \\leq 4.0833...\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\( c \\) needs to be a positive integer, the possible values of \\( c \\) are \\( 1, 2, 3, \\) and \\( 4 \\).\n\n2. **Double Check**\n\n   - For \\( c = 1 \\): \n     \n     The discriminant is \\( 49 - 12 \\times 1 = 37 \\), which is positive.\n   \n   - For \\( c = 2 \\): \n     \n     The discriminant is \\( 49 - 12 \\times 2 = 25 \\), which is positive.\n   \n   - For \\( c = 3 \\): \n     \n     The discriminant is \\( 49 - 12 \\times 3 = 13 \\), which is positive.\n   \n   - For \\( c = 4 \\): \n     \n     The discriminant is \\( 49 - 12 \\times 4 = 1 \\), which is positive.\n\nAll these values satisfy the condition for having real roots.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nNow that we've identified the values for \\( c \\), we need the product of all these values: \n\n\\[\n1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 24\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nThe reasoning seems consistent, and I've checked the logical steps. The discrimination checks out for each integer value from 1 to 4, and being thorough in verifying the discriminant ensures we have covered all positive integer solutions. The final product calculation matches the conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe product of all positive integer values of \\( c \\) such that \\( 3x^2 + 7x + c = 0 \\) has two real roots is \\( \\boxed{24} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "For a quadratic to have two real roots, the discriminant must be greater than 0. So we require \\begin{align*}7^2-4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot c &> 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 49-12c &>0\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ c&<\\frac{49}{12}.\\end{align*}The largest integer smaller than $\\frac{49}{12}$ is 4. Thus, the positive integer values of $c$ are 1, 2, 3, and 4, and their product is $\\boxed{24}$."
