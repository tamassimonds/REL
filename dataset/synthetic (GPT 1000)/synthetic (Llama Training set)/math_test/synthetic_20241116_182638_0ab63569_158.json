    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. \n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:** Okay, we're dealing with a convex pentagon with two congruent, acute angles. The other three angles are equal, and each is the sum of the two acute angles. I need to find the common measure of these larger angles. \n\n**Reflection:** Pentagon interior angles are straightforward to work with because the sum is constant. This feels familiar because it involves both geometry and algebraic expressions.\n\n### **Step 2: Total Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon**\n\n**Thought Process:** A pentagon has five sides. The formula for the sum of interior angles of an n-sided polygon is \\((n-2) \\times 180\\).\n\n\\[ \n5 - 2 = 3 \\rightarrow 3 \\times 180 = 540 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Yes, the sum of interior angles indeed matches my expectations.\n\n### **Step 3: Assign Variables and Equations**\n\n**Thoughts:** Let\u2019s denote the two congruent acute angles by \\( x \\). Therefore, the sum of these two congruent angles is \\( 2x \\). The other three angles, being equal and each equal to the sum of the two acute angles, would be \\( x + x = 2x \\).\n\nEach of the larger angles would be \\( 2x \\) since it's the sum of the measures of the two acute angles \\( x \\).\n\nLet's assign the angles:\n- Two angles are \\( x \\) each,\n- Three angles are \\( 2x \\) each.\n\n\\[ \nx + x + 2x + 2x + 2x = 540\n\\]  \n\n**Check:** Everything checks out algebraically so far; I think this setup correctly models the pentagon's angles. \n\n### **Step 4: Simplify and Solve the Algebraic Equation**\n\n**Equations:** Simplify the expression:\n\n\\[ \n2x + 6x = 540 \n\\]\n\n\\[ \n8x = 540 \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{540}{8} \n\\]\n\n\\[ \nx = 67.5 \\]\n\n**Check:** This gives each acute angle as \\(67.5\\) degrees. \n\n### **Step 5: Determine the Measure of Larger Angles**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nThe larger angles are \\(2x\\), and we found \\(x = 67.5\\).\n\n\\[ \n2x = 2 \\times 67.5 = 135 \n\\]\n\n**Verification:** Double-checking, if the larger angles are each \\(135\\) degrees, adding everything up, I get:\n\n\\[ \n2(67.5) + 3(135) = 135 + 405 = 540 \n\\]\n\n**Accurate Check:** The angles add up to the polygon\u2019s interior angle sum requirement, confirming my calculations!\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe common measure of the large angles in the pentagon is \\(135\\) degrees. I feel confident about the solution, and I verified the calculations. Everything aligns with the properties and rules of the polygon's geometry.\n\nThis helped me understand how algebra connects with geometry in solving such problems, reaffirming the approach towards finding unknowns by equating expressions to known sums.",

  "ground_truth": "If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \\[\nx+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \\implies 8x = 540 \\implies x=135/2.\n\\] The large angles each measure $2x=\\boxed{135}$ degrees."
