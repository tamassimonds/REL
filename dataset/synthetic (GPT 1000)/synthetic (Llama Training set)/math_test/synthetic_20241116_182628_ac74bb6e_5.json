    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The expression given is \\(10x^2 - x - 24\\) and we need to express it in the form \\((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\\). Our goal is to find \\(AB + B\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\n**First Thoughts:** \nThis feels like a problem involving factoring a quadratic expression. Given that \\(Ax - 8\\) and \\(Bx + 3\\) are factors, we will likely use matching coefficients of expanding these factors to the given quadratic expression.\n\n### Step 2: Expand the Given Form\n\n**Idea:** \nLet's expand \\((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\\) to see what it looks like in a standard quadratic form.\n\n\\[\n(Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) = ABx^2 + 3Ax - 8Bx - 24\n\\]\n\nLet's rearrange and group similar terms:\n\n\\[\n= ABx^2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \nThis should match with \\(10x^2 - x - 24\\). Therefore, equating coefficients on both sides gives us:\n\n1. \\(AB = 10\\)\n2. \\(3A - 8B = -1\\)\n3. Constant term: \\(-24 = -24\\) (No new information here)\n\n### Step 3: Solve the System of Equations\n\n**Equation 1:** \\(AB = 10\\)  \n\nWe need pairs \\((A, B)\\) such that they multiply to 10. This gives us potential integer pairs \\((1, 10), (2, 5), (5, 2), (10, 1), (-1, -10), (-2, -5), (-5, -2), (-10, -1)\\).\n\n**Equation 2:** \\(3A - 8B = -1\\)\n\nLet's substitute each pair from \\(AB = 10\\) into this equation.\n\n- **Try:** \\(A = 2, B = 5\\)\n  \n  Substituting into \\(3A - 8B = -1\\):\n\n  \\[\n  3(2) - 8(5) = 6 - 40 = -34 \\quad (\\text{does not work})\n  \\]\n\n- **Try:** \\(A = 5, B = 2\\)\n\n  Substituting:\n\n  \\[\n  3(5) - 8(2) = 15 - 16 = -1 \\quad (\\text{this works})\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Confirm the Pair and Calculate \\(AB + B\\)\n\n**Insight:**\nThe valid pair \\((A, B) = (5, 2)\\) satisfies both equations.\n\nTo find \\(AB + B\\):\n\\[ \nAB + B = 10 + 2 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \nI took care to verify both constraints with this pair. Everything checks out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUpon confirming everything, the value of \\(AB + B\\) is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).",
