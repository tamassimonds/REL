    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem of finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of 99 and 100. I'll break down each step as if I'm thinking through the problem in real-time. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I realize it's asking about the greatest common factor (GCF), sometimes called the greatest common divisor (GCD). This is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. My brain immediately jumps to thinking about prime factors since they often play a big role in these types of problems.\n\n### Strategy Brainstorm\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - My first thought is to break both numbers down into their prime factors and see what they have in common. This method often works well for finding GCF.\n\n2. **Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - Another approach that comes to mind is using the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient for finding the GCF of two numbers. \n\n3. **Listing Factors:**\n   - Alternatively, I can list all the factors of each number and simply find the greatest one they have in common, but this might not be efficient for larger numbers.\n\n### Initial Approach: Prime Factorization\n\nLet\u2019s start with prime factorization since it seems straightforward here.\n\n- **Prime Factorization of 99:** \n  - 99 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 9+9=18, is divisible by 3).\n  - 99 \u00f7 3 = 33. \n  - 33 is also divisible by 3 (again, the sum of the digits 3+3=6, divisible by 3).\n  - 33 \u00f7 3 = 11.\n  - 11 is a prime number.\n  - So, the prime factorization of 99 is \\(3^2 \\times 11\\).\n\n- **Prime Factorization of 100:** \n  - 100 is even, so divisible by 2.\n  - 100 \u00f7 2 = 50.\n  - 50 is also even, so divisible by 2 again.\n  - 50 \u00f7 2 = 25.\n  - 25 is \\(5^2\\) since 5 is a prime number.\n  - So, the prime factorization of 100 is \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\).\n\n### Checking Common Prime Factors\n\nNow, let's compare the prime factorizations:\n- 99: \\(3^2 \\times 11\\)\n- 100: \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\)\n\nThere are no common prime factors between 99 and 100. Hmm, this suggests that the greatest common factor might be quite small. Let's reflect on this. I should consider whether these numbers possibly share any divisors other than 1.\n\n### Next Steps: Euclidean Algorithm\n\nSince the prime factors weren\u2019t revealing, I'll try the Euclidean Algorithm, which calculates the GCF using subtraction or division.\n\n- Start with numbers 99 and 100.\n  \n  Step 1: 100 - 99 = 1 \n\n  There\u2019s a sudden realization: Oh! This result gives me the clue. Since subtracting 99 from 100 gives 1, and 1 as a number has no divisors other than itself, this suggests the GCF must indeed be 1.\n\n### Reflecting and Confirming\n\nEverything checks out with both methods considered: there are no shared factors in their prime factorization, and the Euclidean Algorithm quickly brought us to the realization that their GCF is 1. \n\nI feel confident in this result; even considering potential efficient algorithms, it all boils down to the numbers being consecutive integers, thus co-prime.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe greatest common factor of 99 and 100 is **1**. This makes sense both intuitively, as consecutive numbers are often co-prime, and computationally through our methods explored. \n\nThis exploration has confirmed that the approaches align with what I would typically consider for such problems, and I\u2019m satisfied with the deductive process and outcome.",

  "ground_truth": "$99=3^2\\cdot11$ and $100=2^2\\cdot5^2$, so their GCF is $\\boxed{1}$. From a few more examples you might notice that two consecutive integers have a GCF of 1."
