    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it step by step. The goal is to find the minimum value of the expression given by:\n\n\\[2 \\log_{10} x - \\log_x \\frac{1}{100}\\]\n\nwhere \\(x > 1\\).\n\n### Exploring the Problem\n\n**First Impressions:**  \n- We have a combination of logarithms with different bases, which suggests maybe converting logs to a single base could simplify things. \n- The condition \\(x > 1\\) suggests that maybe as \\(x\\) increases or decreases beyond this point, the expression might simplify or hit a minimum.\n- My first instinct is, \"Is this something like a derivative problem for finding minima?\" Let's explore that.\n\n### Strategy 1: Converting Logs\n\n**Convert Logs to a Common Base:**  \nLet's first try to express everything in terms of base 10:\n\n1. \\( \\log_x \\frac{1}{100} = \\frac{\\log_{10} \\frac{1}{100}}{\\log_{10} x} = \\frac{\\log_{10} 10^{-2}}{\\log_{10} x} = \\frac{-2}{\\log_{10} x} \\) \n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[ 2 \\log_{10} x + \\frac{2}{\\log_{10} x} \\]\n\n**New Goal:**  \nMinimize the expression \\( 2 \\log_{10} x + \\frac{2}{\\log_{10} x} \\).\n\n### Strategy 2: Calculus Approach\n\n**Using Calculus to Find Minima:**  \nWe know from calculus that to find the minimum of a function, we should take its derivative and set it equal to zero.\n\n- Let's name our new function:  \n  \\( f(y) = 2y + \\frac{2}{y} \\), where \\( y = \\log_{10} x \\).\n\n- Differentiate \\( f(y) \\):  \n  \\( f'(y) = 2 - \\frac{2}{y^2} \\).\n\n- Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:  \n  \\[ 2 - \\frac{2}{y^2} = 0 \\]  \n  \\[ \\frac{2}{y^2} = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y^2 = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 1 \\]\n\n  Note: We disregarded \\( y = -1 \\) as \\( y = \\log_{10} x > 0 \\) because \\( x > 1 \\).\n\n- Plugging \\( y = 1 \\) back into the expression, we have:  \n  \\[ f(1) = 2(1) + \\frac{2}{1} = 2 + 2 = 4 \\]\n\n### Check Your Work\n\n- Is \\( y = 1 \\) a minimum? \n  Let's quickly check the second derivative:  \n  \\( f''(y) = \\frac{4}{y^3} \\)\n\n- At \\( y = 1 \\), \\( f''(1) = 4 > 0 \\), which means we indeed have a local minimum.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEventually, after this exploration, calculations, and considerations, we've determined that the minimum value of the given expression for \\( x > 1 \\) is \\( \\boxed{4} \\). This hits all checks: finding the derivative, verifying a minimum by second derivative, and considering the domain constraints. \n\nThis aligns with the desired approach to not only solve but deeply understand each aspect of the problem.",
