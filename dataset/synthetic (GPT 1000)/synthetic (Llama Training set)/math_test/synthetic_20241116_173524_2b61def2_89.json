    "working_out": "### Brainstorming and Understanding the Problem:\n\n1. **Problem Restatement**: We have a triangle where \\( \\angle A = \\angle B \\). The sides are labeled as \\( 3x - 1 \\), \\( 2x + 2 \\), and \\( x + 4 \\).\n\n2. **Initial Thoughts**:\n   - This is an isosceles triangle because \\( \\angle A = \\angle B \\).\n   - The sides opposite to these equal angles will also be equal.\n   - Therefore, the side opposite \\( \\angle A \\) should be equal to the side opposite \\( \\angle B \\).\n\n3. **Labeling and Side Setup**:\n   - Let\u2019s assume the side opposite \\( \\angle A \\) is \\( 2x + 2 \\).\n   - Assume the side opposite \\( \\angle B \\) is \\( x + 4 \\).\n   - Thus, we have: \\( 2x + 2 = x + 4 \\).\n\n### Solving the Equations Step by Step:\n\n1. **Setting up the Equation**:\n   - Start with the equation \\( 2x + 2 = x + 4 \\).\n\n2. **Simplifying the Equation**:\n   - Subtract \\( x \\) from both sides: \\( 2x - x + 2 = 4 \\).\n   - This simplifies to: \\( x + 2 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\( x \\)**:\n   - Subtract 2 from both sides: \\( x = 4 - 2 \\).\n   - Thus, \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Verify the Side Lengths**:\n   - Calculate each side with \\( x = 2 \\):\n     - \\( 3x - 1 = 3(2) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 \\).\n     - \\( 2x + 2 = 2(2) + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \\).\n     - \\( x + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6 \\).\n\n2. **Checking the Isosceles Condition**:\n   - The side lengths are \\( 5 \\), \\( 6 \\), \\( 6 \\).\n   - We see the triangle is isosceles with the sides \\( 6 \\) and \\( 6 \\) opposite to angles \\( \\angle A \\) and \\( \\angle B \\).\n\n3. **Reflect on the Approach**:\n   - Our approach made logical sense because we equated the sides opposite the angles that were equal.\n   - Verification of side lengths confirms that \\( x = 2 \\) is consistent with an isosceles triangle setup.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The value of \\( x \\) is indeed \\( \\boxed{2} \\).\n- The process was logical, checking alignment with the problem constraints at each step ensures correctness.\n- **Final Reflection**: The problem followed expected patterns (isosceles triangle properties) which validated our choice in equations. Always good to verify assumptions with calculations!\n\n### Reevaluating and Exploring Other Approaches:\n\nAh, I see there was an oversight in my previous response. Let's go through the process again, and this time, we'll look at other strategies to ensure we find the correct solution.\n\n### Revisiting the Problem:\n\n1. **Original Restatement**: We have a triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with \\( \\angle A = \\angle B \\). The sides are labeled as \\( 3x - 1 \\), \\( 2x + 2 \\), and \\( x + 4 \\).\n\n2. **Properties of Isosceles Triangle**: Since \\( \\angle A = \\angle B \\), the triangle is isosceles and the sides opposite these equal angles must be equal.\n\n### Explore Alternative Strategies:\n\n#### Strategy 1: Re-evaluate which sides are opposite the equal angles.\n\n- Originally, I assumed \\( 2x + 2 \\) and \\( x + 4 \\) were the sides opposite \\( \\angle A \\) and \\( \\angle B \\).\n  \n- Let's verify by labeling again:\n  - Assume the side opposite \\( \\angle A \\) is \\( 3x - 1 \\).\n  - Side opposite \\( \\angle B \\) is also \\( 3x - 1 \\).\n  \n- This means \\( 2x + 2 \\) should not equal \\( x + 4 \\) but rather \\( 3x - 1 \\).\n\n#### Strategy 2: Solve for \\( x \\) with corrected assumptions.\n\n- Given \\( \\angle A = \\angle B \\), equate \\( 2x + 2 = 3x - 1 \\).\n\n### Solving the Corrected Equation:\n\n1. **Set up the Equation**:\n   - \\( 2x + 2 = 3x - 1 \\).\n\n2. **Simplifying the Equation**:\n   - Subtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides: \\( 2 = x - 1 \\).\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   - Add 1 to both sides: \\( 2 + 1 = x \\).\n   - Thus, \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Calculate Each Side with \\( x = 3 \\)**:\n   - \\( 3x - 1 = 3(3) - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8 \\).\n   - \\( 2x + 2 = 2(3) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \\).\n   - \\( x + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7 \\).\n\n2. **Check the Isosceles Condition**:\n   - We see the triangle has side lengths \\( 8 \\), \\( 8 \\), and \\( 7 \\).\n   - This supports the isosceles condition as expected.\n\n### Conclusion and Reflection:\n\n- The correct value of \\( x \\) is indeed \\( \\boxed{3} \\).\n- By reassessing which sides were opposite the equal angles, the solution aligns logically with the problem's constraints.\n- Reflecting on the approach and exploring different possibilities is crucial to ensure a correct understanding. Always challenge initial assumptions and validate through re-examination and recalculations.\n\nAh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's revisit the problem and explore different strategies to ensure we find the correct solution.\n\n### Brainstorming and Understanding the Problem Again:\n\n1. **Restating the Problem**: We have a triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with \\( \\angle A = \\angle B \\). The given side lengths are labeled as \\( 3x - 1 \\), \\( 2x + 2 \\), and \\( x + 4 \\).\n\n2. **Re-evaluating the Isosceles Triangle Property**: Since \\( \\angle A = \\angle B \\), the triangle is isosceles. This means the sides opposite these equal angles must also be equal.\n\n### Exploring Alternative Strategies:\n\n#### Strategy 1: Reconsider the Equal Sides\n\n- Initially, I assumed the sides opposite equal angles were \\( 2x + 2 \\) and \\( x + 4 \\), which led me to an incorrect solution.\n- Let's reassess which sides are opposite to the equal angles:\n  - Assume the side opposite \\( \\angle A \\) is \\( 2x + 2 \\).\n  - Assume the side opposite \\( \\angle B \\) is \\( 3x - 1 \\).\n  \n- Therefore, we should set the equation for these sides as \\( 2x + 2 = 3x - 1 \\).\n\n#### Strategy 2: Solving the Corrected Equation\n\n1. **Setting up the Correct Equation**:\n   - \\( 2x + 2 = 3x - 1 \\).\n\n2. **Simplifying the Equation**:\n   - Subtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides: \\( 2 = x - 1 \\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\( x \\)**:\n   - Add 1 to both sides: \\( 2 + 1 = x \\).\n   - Thus, \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. **Calculate Each Side with \\( x = 3 \\)**:\n   - \\( 3x - 1 = 3(3) - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8 \\).\n   - \\( 2x + 2 = 2(3) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \\).\n   - \\( x + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7 \\).\n\n2. **Check the Isosceles Condition**:\n   - We see the triangle has side lengths \\( 8 \\), \\( 8 \\), and \\( 7 \\).\n   - This confirms the triangle is indeed isosceles as \\( \\angle A = \\angle B \\).\n\n### Conclusion and Reflection:\n\n- The correct value of \\( x \\) is \\( \\boxed{3} \\).\n- By reassessing which sides are opposite the equal angles, the solution aligns logically with the problem's constraints.\n- Reflecting on the approach and exploring different possibilities is crucial to ensure a correct understanding. Always challenge initial assumptions and validate through re-examination and recalculations.\n\nThis revised approach verifies that the solution is consistent with the properties of isosceles triangles, ensuring the value of \\( x \\) is correctly determined.",
