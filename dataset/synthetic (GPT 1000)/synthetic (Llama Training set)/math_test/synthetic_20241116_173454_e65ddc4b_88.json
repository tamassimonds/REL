    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem to find the value of \\( c \\) that results in exactly one solution, or a repeated root, for the quadratic equation \\( 3x^2 + 4x + c = 0 \\).\n\n### First Impressions\n\nWhen I first read this problem, it feels familiar. It seems related to the concept of discriminants in quadratic equations because that's how I usually determine the nature of the roots.\n\n### Brainstorming Possible Strategies\n\n1. **Using the Discriminant**: I know that the discriminant (\\( \\Delta \\)) of the quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by the formula \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\). The discriminant tells us about the nature of the roots:\n   - If \\( \\Delta > 0 \\), the equation has two distinct real roots.\n   - If \\( \\Delta = 0 \\), the equation has exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n   - If \\( \\Delta < 0 \\), the equation has no real roots (complex roots).\n\n2. **Graphical Approach**: Sketching the parabola can visually confirm that with a discriminant of zero, the vertex of the parabola touches the x-axis.\n\n3. **Testing Values of \\( c \\)**: I could also try a few values of \\( c \\) to see how they affect the discriminant, but that seems more trial-and-error and not as elegant.\n\nThe discriminant approach seems the most direct, so I will focus on that.\n\n### Solving with the Discriminant\n\nLet's apply the discriminant to our specific quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ \na = 3, \\quad b = 4, \\quad c = c \n\\]\n\nThe discriminant is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot c \n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = 16 - 12c \n\\]\n\n### Setting the Condition for Exactly One Solution\n\nSince we want exactly one real solution, we need the discriminant to be zero:\n\n\\[\n16 - 12c = 0\n\\]\n\nLet's solve for \\( c \\):\n\n1. Rearrange the equation: \n   \\[\n    16 = 12c\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 12:\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}\n   \\]\n\n### Reflecting on the Solution\n\nSo, the value of \\( c \\) that gives exactly one solution for the quadratic \\( 3x^2 + 4x + c = 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\nI've derived this using the discriminant method, which feels right given the problem's requirement for exactly one solution. Everything checks out because setting the discriminant to zero is the proper condition for a repeated root.\n\n### Final Check\n\nLet me quickly verify: If I substitute \\( c = \\frac{4}{3} \\) back into my discriminant equation, I get:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = 16 - 12 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 16 - 16 = 0\n\\]\n\nYes, the discriminant is zero, confirming that there is exactly one solution.\n\nThe approach using the discriminant was efficient, and the calculations led directly to the correct result.",

  "ground_truth": "We will have one solution for $x$ when our discriminant is zero. Our discriminant is $b^2 - 4ac = (4)^2 - 4(3)(c) = 16 - 12c.$ Setting this to zero, we have $16 - 12c = 0,$ so $c = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{3}}.$"
