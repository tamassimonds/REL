    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: finding the units digit of \\(13^{19} \\cdot 19^{13}\\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts... Hmm. This problem requires us to find the units digit, which simplifies things a bit. The units digit of a product (or power) depends solely on the units digits of the numbers involved. So we only need the units digits of \\(13\\) and \\(19\\), which are \\(3\\) and \\(9\\) respectively.\n\nSo the problem boils down to calculating the units digit of \\(3^{19} \\cdot 9^{13}\\).\n\n**Step 2: Break Down the Problem into Manageable Parts**\n\nLet's tackle this by breaking it further:\n\n- First, determine the units digit of \\(3^{19}\\).\n- Then, determine the units digit of \\(9^{13}\\).\n- Lastly, multiply these units digits to get the final result.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Units Digit of \\(3^{19}\\)**\n\nWait, powers of 3... That reminds me about patterns in repeatable cycles in units digits. Units digits tend to follow periodic patterns. Let's explore the pattern for powers of 3:\n\n- \\(3^1 = 3\\), units digit is 3.\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\), units digit is 9.\n- \\(3^3 = 27\\), units digit is 7.\n- \\(3^4 = 81\\), units digit is 1.\n- \\(3^5 = 243\\), units digit (back to) is 3.\n\nAh! There seems to be a cycle every 4 powers: \\(3, 9, 7, 1\\).\n\nTo find \\(3^{19}\\), we should consider the position in the cycle. The cycle length is 4, so we can divide the exponent by 4 and look at the remainder:\n\\[ 19 \\div 4 \\text{ gives a remainder of } 3. \\]\n\nThus, \\(3^{19}\\) aligns with \\(3^3\\) in the cycle, which has a units digit of 7.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Units Digit of \\(9^{13}\\)**\n\nNext, let's figure out the units digit of \\(9^{13}\\).\n\nNow that I think of it, powers of 9 are simpler:\n\n- \\(9^1 = 9\\), units digit is 9.\n- \\(9^2 = 81\\), units digit is 1.\n- \\(9^3 = 729\\), units digit is 9.\n- \\(9^4 = 6561\\), units digit is 1.\n\nAnother recognizable cycle: \\(9, 1\\), repeating every 2 cycles.\n\nLet's find the position for \\(9^{13}\\):\n\\[ 13 \\div 2 \\text{ gives a remainder of } 1. \\]\n\nSo \\(9^{13}\\) aligns with \\(9^1\\) in the cycle, which has a units digit of 9.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Results**\n\nFinally, we combine to find the units digit of \\(3^{19} \\cdot 9^{13}\\).\n\nMultiply the two results:\n\\[ 7 \\cdot 9 = 63. \\]\n\nThe units digit of 63 is \\(3\\).\n\n**Reflection and Check**\n\nOh, I feel good about this approach. I broke it down into digestible parts, checked cycles for potential errors along the way, and it seems consistent. Let's do a quick check:\n\n- Cycles: Checked, they both repeat consistently.\n- Remainders: Divisions for 19 and 13 returned accurate correspondences to cycle positions.\n- Multiplication: Simply finding units of 63, confirmed 3.\n\nThus, the units digit of \\(13^{19} \\cdot 19^{13}\\) is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since the tens digits don't matter to us, the problem is the same as finding the units digit of $3^{19} \\cdot 9^{13} = 3^{19} \\cdot 3^{26} = 3^{45}$.  Now we go hunting for the pattern of units digits of powers of 3:  \\begin{align*} 3^1 &= 3 \\\\ 3^2 &= 9 \\\\ 3^3 &= 27 \\\\ 3^4 &= 81 \\\\ 3^5 &= 243 \\end{align*}  The cycle of units digits is 4 long.  Since $45 \\div 4 \\equiv 1\\pmod 4$, we know that $3^{45}$ has the same units digit as $3^1 = \\boxed{3}$."
