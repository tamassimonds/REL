    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step with the goal of finding the units digit of \\(1! + 3! + 5! + 7! + 9! + 11!\\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nThe units digit of a number is the last digit of that number. So, we need to find the last digit of the sum \\(1! + 3! + 5! + 7! + 9! + 11!\\). To do this, we first need to determine the units digit of each factorial in the sum and then add them together.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Factorials and Their Units Digits**\n\nLet's consider each factorial individually:\n\n- **\\(1!\\)**: \\(1! = 1\\). The units digit is \\(1\\).\n- **\\(3!\\)**: \\(3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\\). The units digit is \\(6\\).\n- **\\(5!\\)**: \\(5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\\). The units digit is \\(0\\).\n- **\\(7!\\)**: \\(7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040\\). The units digit is \\(0\\).\n- **\\(9!\\)**: \\(9! = 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 362880\\). The units digit is \\(0\\).\n- **\\(11!\\)**: \\(11! = 11 \\times 10!\\). Since \\(10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\) contains a 10, the units digit is \\(0\\).\n\nReflecting on this, I notice that for any \\(n! \\) where \\(n \\geq 5\\), the factorial includes the factors 5 and 2 (as 2 and 5 multiply to give 10), which means the units digit will always be 0 for \\(n! \\geq 5!\\). So the only factorials I really need to care about for the units digit are \\(1!\\) and \\(3!\\).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Sum and Units Digit**\n\nNow, let's sum up the units digits we calculated:\n\n- \\(1! = 1\\) with a units digit of \\(1\\) \n- \\(3! = 6\\) with a units digit of \\(6\\)\n  \nSo, the units digit of \\(1! + 3! + 5! + 7! + 9! + 11!\\) would be the same as the units digit of \\(1 + 6 = 7\\).\n\n**Step 4: Reflect and Verify**\n\nChecking over the steps, this seems consistent. We identified that factorials greater than or equal to 5! will not contribute to the units digit because they end in 0. Therefore, our final result is indeed:\n\nThe units digit of \\(1! + 3! + 5! + 7! + 9! + 11!\\) is \\(7\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We observe that for all $n\\geq5$, $n!$ has a units digit of 0, because $5!$ has a factor of 5 and 2, which become a factor of 10. So, the terms in the sum, $5!$, $7!$, $9!$, and $11!$ all have a 0 for the units digit. And, $1!+3! = 1+6 = \\boxed{7}$ is the units digit of the sum."
