    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The main goal is to determine how many laps I would need to run on a 250-meter track for it to equal the workout I usually get by running 10 laps on a 400-meter track.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst thoughts: This involves converting the total distance I run on a 400-meter track to an equivalent total distance on a 250-meter track. I think this is similar to a problem of converting units or scaling.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Distance on the 400-meter Track\n- I run 10 laps on a 400-meter track.\n- The formula to calculate the total distance is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Distance} = \\text{Number of Laps} \\times \\text{Distance per Lap}\n  \\]\n- Substituting the given values:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Distance} = 10 \\times 400 = 4000 \\text{ meters}\n  \\]\n\nChecking: 10 times 400 does give 4000. That makes sense; 4000 meters is the total distance for the original track.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of Laps on a 250-meter Track\nNext, I need to figure out how many laps on a 250-meter track would add up to 4000 meters.\n\n- Here, I'll set up a new equation using the same formula but for the 250-meter track.\n- Let \\( x \\) denote the number of laps needed on the 250-meter track.\n\nThe equation is:\n\\[\nx \\times 250 = 4000\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\( x \\)\nTo find \\( x \\):\n- Divide both sides by 250 meters:\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{4000}{250}\n  \\]\n\nQuick check: 4000 divided by 250 should give me the number of laps.\n\nCalculating:\n  \\[\n  x = 16\n  \\]\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Answer\nFinal check: \n\n- 16 laps on a 250-meter track would give:\n  \\[\n  16 \\times 250 = 4000 \\text{ meters}\n  \\]\n\nThat's exactly the same total distance as before, confirming my work.\n\n### Conclusion\nI would need to run 16 laps on the 250-meter track to achieve the same workout distance as 10 laps on a 400-meter track.\n\nReflection: This approach feels quite solid because the basic principle is about equating the total distance, which should be similar irrespective of track length. It's simply about scaling the number of laps based on track size. Everything seems consistent, and my calculations support the solution logically.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the total distance that I run is constant, the length of each lap and the total number of laps are inversely proportional. Consequently, if each lap is $\\frac{250}{400}=\\frac{5}{8}$ as long, I need to run $\\frac{8}{5}$ as many laps, so our answer is $\\frac{8}{5}\\cdot10=\\boxed{16}$ laps."
