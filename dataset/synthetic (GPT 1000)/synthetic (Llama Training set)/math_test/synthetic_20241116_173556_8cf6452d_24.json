    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. \n\n**Initial thoughts:** \nThe problem asks us to find positive two-digit integers that are common factors of both 100 and 150. This reminds me of problems where we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) or list all common divisors, but with an added twist of being limited to two-digit numbers. Hmm, finding factors usually starts with the prime factorizations. I should keep that in mind. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\nI should begin by finding the prime factorizations of both 100 and 150 to help identify common factors.\n\n- For 100: \n  100 = 10 \u00d7 10 \n       = (2 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 5)\n       = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b2\n\n- For 150: \n  150 = 15 \u00d7 10 \n       = (3 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 5)\n       = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5\u00b2\n\n**Step 2: Identify common factors**\nNow, I need to find the factors common to both 100 and 150. The common prime factors are 2 and 5. I realize that I need to look for the greatest power of these primes that divides both numbers.\n\n- Common prime factors: 2 and 5\n- The minimum powers of 2 and 5 present in both are:\n  - For 2: minimum power is 2\u2070 = 1 (since 100 has 2\u00b2 and 150 has 2\u00b9)\n  - For 5: minimum power is 5\u00b2 (since both numbers have it as highest)\n\nTherefore, the greatest common factor is:\n- GCF = 2\u2070 \u00d7 5\u00b2 = 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n\nWait, let\u2019s think. The greatest common factor isn\u2019t necessarily the only common factor, but 25 is definitely one such factor. I need to consider others too. \n\n**Step 3: Enumerate common factors**\nThe common factors might be the divisors of the GCF. Also, both 100 and 150 might share other divisors that are not necessarily limited by the lowest powers. I think I should list all factors of 100 and 150 and find intersections.\n\n- Factors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100\n- Factors of 150: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150\n\nCommon factors: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50\n\n**Step 4: Find two-digit factors**\nNow, I filter out the two-digit numbers: 10, 25, and 50\n\n**Checking:**\nWait, I should confirm these are indeed divisors of both. \n- 100 \u00f7 10 = 10, 150 \u00f7 10 = 15 -> Okay, 10 is good.\n- 100 \u00f7 25 = 4, 150 \u00f7 25 = 6 -> Okay, 25 is good.\n- 100 \u00f7 50 = 2, 150 \u00f7 50 = 3 -> Okay, 50 is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe two-digit integers that are factors of both 100 and 150 are 10, 25, and 50. So, there are three such numbers.\n\nReflecting on this approach, it makes sense to list factors and cross-check through division; it ensures nothing is missed. I feel confident in saying the answer is three two-digit integers: 10, 25, and 50.",
