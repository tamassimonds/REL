    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- When I first read the problem, I found it to be an interesting mix of modular arithmetic and prime number checking. The goal is to identify a number that meets two criteria: it must be prime and, when divided by 25, it leaves a remainder of 2. \n- This reminds me of problems where you look for numbers with specific modular properties, but with the added challenge of being a prime.\n- My mind immediately suggests starting with numbers slightly above 25, and checking both properties: that they leave the remainder 2 when divided by 25, and that they are prime numbers.\n\nInitial Strategy Brainstorm:\n- I could start by evaluating consecutive integers greater than 25 and check both conditions. But that seems a bit mechanical and might require checking a lot of numbers.\n- Instead, a quicker way might be leveraging modular arithmetic to establish an equation - I know that if \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{25} \\), then \\( n = 25k + 2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). I can systematically increase \\( k \\) and check for primality until I find the smallest solution. \n\nStep-by-Step Approach:\n1. I\u2019ll start by setting up the equation based on the modular condition: \\( n = 25k + 2 \\).\n2. Initially, I let \\( k = 1 \\) for the smallest number greater than 25 that fits the modular constraint.\n   - Calculation: \\( n = 25\\cdot1 + 2 = 27 \\).\n   - Check for primality: 27 is not prime (divisible by 3).\n3. Let\u2019s increment \\( k \\) because 27 didn't work. \n   - \\( k = 2 \\): \\( n = 25\\cdot2 + 2 = 52 \\).\n   - Check for primality: 52 is not prime (divisible by 2).\n4. Continue increasing \\( k \\):\n   - \\( k = 3 \\): \\( n = 25\\cdot3 + 2 = 77 \\).\n   - Check for primality: 77 is not prime (divisible by 7 and 11).\n5. Increment \\( k \\) again:\n   - \\( k = 4 \\): \\( n = 25\\cdot4 + 2 = 102 \\).\n   - Check for primality: 102 is not prime (divisible by 2).\n6. Keep going:\n   - \\( k = 5 \\): \\( n = 25\\cdot5 + 2 = 127 \\).\n   - Check for primality: 127 is prime.\n\nReflection:\n- At this point, I should pause and reflect. I've found that when \\( k = 5 \\), \\( n = 127 \\) is both greater than 25 and a prime number.\n- It seems correct because 127 satisfies all given conditions: it is a prime, and \\( 127 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{25} \\).\n\nCheck:\n- Verify the math: \\( n = 25\\cdot5 + 2 \\) again just to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. \\( 25 \\cdot 5 = 125 \\), \\( 125 + 2 = 127 \\).\n- Confirm primality of 127 using more thorough methods or sources if necessary: small divisors, prime lists, etc. 127 isn't divisible by any prime numbers below its square root (about 11.3).\n\nConclusion:\n- After reviewing everything, I\u2019m confident that 127 is the least prime greater than 25 which leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 25.",

  "ground_truth": "We must find the least prime number, $p$, such that $p=25n+2$ for some positive integer $n$. It is clear that $n$ must be odd because otherwise $p$ is divisible by 2 and hence not prime. $n=1$ gives $p=27$, which is composite. $n=3$ gives $p=77$, which is composite. But $n=5$ gives $p=127$, which is prime. Thus, $\\boxed{127}$ is the least prime number greater than 25 that has a remainder of 2 when divided by 25."
