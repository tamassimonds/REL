    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem. The given problem asks to find \\(|\\overline{z}^2|\\) if \\(|z| = 5\\). \n\n**Step 1: Initial Understanding and Plan**\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this problem involves. The problem deals with complex numbers and their properties, specifically the modulus \\(|z|\\) and the conjugate \\(\\overline{z}\\). \\(|z| = 5\\) suggests that the magnitude (or absolute value) of our complex number \\(z\\) is 5.\n\nGiven the problem, our end goal is to compute \\(|\\overline{z}^2|\\). I can break it down like this:\n- I should recall the properties of complex numbers, especially concerning their conjugates.\n- Consider if there are any relevant properties or identities that involve the conjugate and modulus. \n\n**Step 2: Exploring the Complex Number and Conjugate**\n\nFor any complex number \\( z = a + bi \\), the conjugate \\( \\overline{z} \\) is \\( a - bi \\). A useful property here is that the modulus of a complex number is invariant under conjugation: \n\\[ |\\overline{z}| = |z|. \\]\n\nBy this property, since \\(|z| = 5\\), it follows that \\(|\\overline{z}| = 5\\).\n\n**Step 3: Calculating \\(|\\overline{z}^2|\\)**\n\nNow let's consider \\(\\overline{z}^2\\). This is simply the square of the conjugate of \\(z\\).\n\nThe modulus of a product relation for complex numbers is \\(|ab| = |a| \\cdot |b|\\), which implies that \\(|z^n| = |z|^n\\) for any integer \\(n\\). So:\n\\[ |\\overline{z}^2| = |\\overline{z}|^2. \\]\n\n**Wait, that reminds me of\u2026** \n\nThis means I need to find the modulus of the square of the conjugate, but since we know:\n\\[ |\\overline{z}| = |z| = 5, \\]\nit follows:\n\\[ |\\overline{z}^2| = |\\overline{z}|^2 = |z|^2 = 5^2 = 25. \\]\n\n**Step 4: Verification and Conclusion**\n\nLet me verify whether this makes sense. Checking through the steps:\n- I correctly identified the invariant modulus property under conjugation.\n- I applied the power rule for modulus correctly on the conjugate.\n\nThus, given \\(|z| = 5\\), the computed \\(|\\overline{z}^2| = 25\\) appears sensible. \n\nNo strange numbers emerged that would necessitate a deeper check, and my general application of properties seems solid. So, the final answer is:\n\\[ |\\overline{z}^2| = 25. \\]\n\nReflecting on this step-by-step: the approach seems efficient and self-confirming. I've confirmed the solution using the properties correctly, so I\u2019m confident the answer addresses the problem as needed.",
