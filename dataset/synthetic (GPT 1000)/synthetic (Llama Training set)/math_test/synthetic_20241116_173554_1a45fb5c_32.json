    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\nAlright, I'm looking at the function \\( F(a, b, c, d) = a^b + c^d \\). The question is to find \\( b \\) for which \\( F(4, b, 2, 3) = 12 \\). This feels like a problem where I need to find the correct power \\( b \\) for \\( 4 \\) so that when it is evaluated and combined with \\( 2^3 \\), it equals 12. \n\nI know \\(2^3\\) is a common power sitting at \\(8\\). So, I'm left with figuring out \\(4^b\\). The form of the problem reminds me a bit of algebraic equations where one side needs to be adjusted to equal the other. So, I guess my starting point is understanding how \\(4^b\\) can interact with \\(8\\).\n\nInitial strategy:\n\nFrom the definition, \\( F(4, b, 2, 3) = 4^b + 2^3 = 4^b + 8 \\). I know the whole expression equals 12. Therefore,\n\n\\[ 4^b + 8 = 12. \\]\n\nNext step:\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides to isolate \\(4^b\\):\n\n\\[ 4^b = 12 - 8 \\]\n\\[ 4^b = 4 \\]\n\nWait, \\(4^b = 4\\) is really convenient! It looks like an easy computation for \\(b\\).\n\nNow let's reflect:\n\nThis means I should identify \\(b\\) such that \\(4^b = 4\\). I know:\n\n\\[ 4^1 = 4 \\]\n\nIt seems like \\(b = 1\\).\n\nCheck:\n\nI'll substitute back into the original equation to ensure it holds: \n\n\\[ F(4, 1, 2, 3) = 4^1 + 2^3 = 4 + 8 = 12 \\]\n\nThat checks out perfectly! The steps and reasoning match the given condition.\n\nThoughts on correctness:\n\nThe logic seems solid as I broke down the equation, simplified, and computed step-by-step. Each piece matched with the given condition. \n\nIn summary: \n\n- Explored the relationship between the terms.\n- Focused first on breaking down and simplifying the function.\n- Solved \\( 4^b \\) by removing extraneous elements.\n- Found \\( b \\) effectively and tested the result.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe correctly identified value of \\( b \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( b = 1 \\).",
