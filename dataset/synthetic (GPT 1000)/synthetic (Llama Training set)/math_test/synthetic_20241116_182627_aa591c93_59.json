    "working_out": "Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nAlright, so we have this equation \\((b_a)^2 = 71_a\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are digits. The notation with subscript refers to the base of the number. So, \\((b_a)^2\\) means \\(b\\) is a digit in base \\(a\\), and \\(71_a\\) means 71 expressed in base \\(a\\).\n\nGiven that \\(b = a - 1\\), our goal is to find \\(a\\).\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm Ideas\n\nHmm, let\u2019s break this down further. First, I need to get how numbers work in different bases. For example, in base 10, \\(71_{10}\\) is simply 71. For base 5, \\(71_5\\) would actually be \\(7 \\times 5 + 1 = 36\\).\n\nWhat sticks out to me is that if \\(b = a - 1\\), then \\((b_a)^2\\) would be \\((a-1)^2\\) in base \\(a\\). Alright, this is quite interesting.\n\nStep 3: Set Up the Equation\n\nOkay, so let's try to formulate this further:\n\n- \\(71_a\\) means \\(7a + 1\\) in base 10.\n- \\((b_a)^2 = (a-1)_a^2\\) would mean \\(((a-1) \\times a^0)^2 = (a-1)^2\\).\n\nSo in base 10, we are looking at this equation:\n\n\\((a-1)^2 = 7a + 1\\)\n\nStep 4: Solve the Equation\n\nAlright, time to do some math:\n\n\\[\n(a-1)^2 = a^2 - 2a + 1\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\na^2 - 2a + 1 = 7a + 1\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 7a and 1 from both sides:\n\n\\[\na^2 - 9a = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor the equation:\n\n\\[\na(a - 9) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis means either \\(a = 0\\) or \\(a = 9\\).\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the Solutions\n\nLet's evaluate these solutions because we are using digits:\n\n- If \\(a = 0\\), then base doesn't make sense because a base should be larger than zero. Additionally, \\(b = a - 1\\) gives a nonsensical value.\n\n- If \\(a = 9\\), then \\(b = a - 1 = 8\\), which seems reasonable since both are valid digits.\n\nFinal Step: Verify the Solution\n\nLet\u2019s be sure by plugging \\(a = 9\\) and \\(b = 8\\) back into the original condition:\n\n- \\(b_a\\) becomes \\(8_9\\), or just \\(8\\) in base 10, since \\(8 < 9\\).\n- \\((8_9)^2 = 8^2 = 64\\).\n\nAnd \\(71_a = 71_9\\), which means \\(7 \\times 9 + 1 = 64\\).\n\nWow, that's exactly what \\(8^2\\) gives us. Everything checks out.\n\nConclusion: The correct answer is \\(a = 9\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We begin by replacing $b$ with $a-1$, and expressing both sides in base 10: \\begin{align*} (a-1)^2\\cdot a^0&=7\\cdot a^1+1\\cdot a^0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad a^2-2a+1&=7a+1\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad a^2-9a&=0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad a(a-9)&=0\n\\end{align*}Thus, $a$ is either 0 or 9. However, since we can't have a base equal to 0, we see that $a$ must be $\\boxed{9}$."
