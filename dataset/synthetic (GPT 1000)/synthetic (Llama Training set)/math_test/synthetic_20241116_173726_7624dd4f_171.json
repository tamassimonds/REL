We need to find the smallest \\( N \\) so that the expression \\( 7 + 30N \\) results in a composite number (i.e., not a prime number). \n\n### My Initial Thoughts\n\n- Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. \n- For \\( 7 + 30N \\) to not be a prime, it should have divisors other than 1 and itself.\n- \\( 7 + 30N \\) begins at 37 when \\( N = 1 \\), and increments by 30 as \\( N \\) increases.\n- My task is essentially checking successive values of \\( 7 + 30N \\) for primality starting from \\( N = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate and Test for Small Values of \\( N \\)\n\nLet\u2019s manually check the first few values to see how it goes:\n\n1. **\\( N = 1 \\):**  \n   \\( 7 + 30 \\times 1 = 37 \\)  \n   Is 37 prime?  \n   It feels like it\u2019s prime because it doesn't have divisors other than 1 and 37. Let's check:  \n   - 37 is odd, it\u2019s not divisible by 2.\n   - The sum of the digits isn\u2019t divisible by 3, so not by 3.\n   - Doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.\n   - Next prime to check is 7, and \\( \\sqrt{37} \\approx 6.08 \\), so 7 is too large.  \n   37 is prime.\n\n2. **\\( N = 2 \\):**  \n   \\( 7 + 30 \\times 2 = 67 \\)  \n   Is 67 prime?  \n   - Again, odd, not divisible by 2.\n   - Sum of digits (6+7=13), again not divisible by 3.\n   - Doesn\u2019t end in 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.\n   - Next check is 7, and \\( \\sqrt{67} \\approx 8.19 \\), so check up to that.  \n   67 is not divisible by 7 either (since \\( 67 \\div 7 \\approx 9.57 \\)).  \n   67 is prime.\n\n3. **\\( N = 3 \\):**  \n   \\( 7 + 30 \\times 3 = 97 \\)  \n   Is 97 prime?\n   - Similar checks as above, 97 is odd, sum is 16 (not divisible by 3), doesn\u2019t end with 0 or 5.\n   - Check divisibility by 7 and 11 (since \\( \\sqrt{97} \\approx 9.84 \\)).  \n   Neither divides evenly.  \n   97 is prime.\n\n4. **\\( N = 4 \\):**  \n   \\( 7 + 30 \\times 4 = 127 \\)  \n   Is 127 prime?\n   - Similar checks: odd, sum 10 (not divisible), ends with 7.\n   - Check divisibility by 7 and 11, 13. \\( \\sqrt{127} \\approx 11.27 \\).  \n   None divide evenly.  \n   127 is prime.\n\n5. **\\( N = 5 \\):**  \n   \\( 7 + 30 \\times 5 = 157 \\)  \n   Is 157 prime?  \n   - Similar checks: odd, sum 13 (not divisible), ends with 7.\n   - Check divisibility by 7, 11, 13, since \\( \\sqrt{157} \\approx 12.53 \\).  \n   None divide evenly.  \n   157 is prime.\n\n6. **\\( N = 6 \\):**  \n   \\( 7 + 30 \\times 6 = 187 \\)  \n   Is 187 prime?  \n   - Check divisibility:\n     - Dividing by 11: \\( 187 \\div 11 = 17 \\) exactly.\n   - 11 is a factor, so 187 is not prime since it equals \\( 11 \\times 17 \\).\n\n### Reflection\n\nAt \\( N = 6 \\), \\( 7 + 30 \\times 6 = 187 \\) which is not a prime number. All previous calculations yielded prime numbers, and I had checked them methodically, so this looks correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe smallest positive integer \\( N \\) such that \\( 7 + 30N \\) is not a prime number is \\( N = 6 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since 2, 3, and 5 divide $30N$ but not $7$, they do not divide $30N + 7$.  Similarly, 7 only divides $30N + 7$ if 7 divides $30N$, which means $N$ must be a multiple of 7 for 7 to divide it.  Since no number less than 11 divides $30N + 7$ while $N < 7$, we only need to check when $30N + 7 \\ge 11^2$.  When $N = 4$, $30N + 7 = 127$ is prime.  When $N = 5$, $30N + 7 = 157$ is prime.  However, when $N = \\boxed{6}$, $30N + 7 = 187 = 11 \\cdot 17$ is composite."
