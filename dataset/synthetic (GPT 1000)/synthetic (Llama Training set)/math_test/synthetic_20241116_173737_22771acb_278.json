    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- Okay, I need to count how many prime numbers less than 100 have a units digit of 3. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that are divisible only by themselves and 1, so they can't be even (except for 2) or end in 5 (except for 5 itself).\n- A number ending in 3 could be prime, but not all numbers that end with 3 will be prime. For example, 33 is not a prime number.\n\nLet's see what strategies might help:\n1. Listing all the prime numbers less than 100 and checking if their units digit is 3. This seems direct and straightforward.\n2. Alternatively, calculating only numbers with the last digit 3 and checking for primality could be faster if there are fewer primes that meet the requirement.\n3. Double-check by ensuring my listed primes with a units digit of 3 aren't divisible by any primes less than their square root.\n\nPlan:\n- I'll go with the first strategy initially: list all primes under 100, and then filter those with a units digit of 3.\n- If this gets unwieldy or I suspect I missed something, I might pivot to calculating numbers ending in 3.\n\nStep 1: Listing primes under 100.\n- Alright, let's start listing all primes under 100.\n- 2 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 3 (ends in 3, so it's a candidate)\n- 5 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 7 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 11 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 13 (ends in 3, so it's a candidate)\n- 17 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 19 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 23 (ends in 3, so it's a candidate)\n- 29 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 31 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 37 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 41 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 43 (ends in 3, so it's a candidate)\n- 47 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 53 (ends in 3, so it's a candidate)\n- 59 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 61 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 67 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 71 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 73 (ends in 3, so it's a candidate)\n- 79 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 83 (ends in 3, so it's a candidate)\n- 89 (doesn't end in 3)\n- 97 (doesn't end in 3)\n\nStep 2: Counting the ones that end in 3.\n- The primes with units digit 3 from the list above: 3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83.\n- Let me count these: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\nStep 3: Quick reflection to ensure accuracy.\n- I'll do a sanity check to make sure I didn\u2019t miss any primes. I know that primes under 100 have to all be checked once, and I cross-referenced their units digits.\n- Apart from checking primality through divisibility by numbers smaller than their square root, which I implicitly did while listing, each candidate here was checked against primal factors like 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nConclusion:\n- There are 7 prime numbers less than 100 with a units digit of 3.\n- This approach seems thorough: listing ensured I pondered each prime properly. An alternative method might involve checking only numbers ending in 3 and testing for primality, but my method counted carefully without oversight.",

  "ground_truth": "We list out all the positive integers less than 100 with a units digit of 3:  3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93.  Of these, only 33, 63, and 93 are not prime.  Thus our answer is $\\boxed{7}$."
