    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking through it as naturally as possible.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** \n   - We're asked to find the least positive integer that is divisible by the first five composite numbers.\n   - Composite numbers are integers greater than 1 that are not prime, meaning they have divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n   - The challenge here is essentially to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of these composite numbers.\n\n2. **Identifying the First Five Composite Numbers:**\n   - Let's start by listing out numbers and identifying which are composite.\n   - 1 (not composite since it's not greater than 1), 2 (prime), 3 (prime), 4 (composite), 5 (prime), 6 (composite), 7 (prime), 8 (composite), 9 (composite), 10 (composite). \n   - So, the first five composite numbers are: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10.\n\n3. **Plan and Potential Strategies:**\n   - Calculate the LCM of these numbers: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10. \n   - The LCM is the smallest number that each of these numbers will divide into without leaving a remainder. \n   - Strategy Options: \n     - Prime factorization of each number and then use the highest power of each prime appearing in any factorization. \n     - List multiples strategy: for smaller numbers, sometimes listing a few multiples and finding common ones can help, but this might be inefficient here.\n\n### Starting the Calculation\n\n4. **Prime Factorization Approach:**\n   - Factor each composite number into prime factors:\n     - \\(4 = 2^2\\)\n     - \\(6 = 2 \\times 3\\)\n     - \\(8 = 2^3\\)\n     - \\(9 = 3^2\\)\n     - \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\)\n\n5. **Determine the LCM Using the Prime Factors:**\n   - Look at each prime factor and take the highest power of each:\n     - For the prime 2, the highest power appears in 8, so we take \\(2^3\\).\n     - For the prime 3, the highest power appears in 9, so we take \\(3^2\\).\n     - For the prime 5, the only occurrence is in 10, so include \\(5^1\\).\n   - LCM = \\(2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the Multiplication:**\n   - Now compute the LCM:\n     - \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n     - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n     - \\(8 \\times 9 = 72\\)\n     - \\(72 \\times 5 = 360\\)\n\n7. **Reflection and Verification:**\n   - Is 360 truly divisible by each of the numbers (4, 6, 8, 9, 10)?\n   - Quick divisibility checks:\n     - 360 \u00f7 4 = 90 (integer, check)\n     - 360 \u00f7 6 = 60 (integer, check)\n     - 360 \u00f7 8 = 45 (integer, check)\n     - 360 \u00f7 9 = 40 (integer, check)\n     - 360 \u00f7 10 = 36 (integer, check)\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - Yes, 360 is divisible by each of the given composite numbers. Therefore, it is indeed the least positive integer meeting the criteria described in the problem.\n\nThroughout this, I'm reflecting on whether my strategy makes sense, checking calculations for mistakes, and feel satisfied with the thorough understanding of the composite numbers and checks on divisibility. Hence, the answer is 360.",

  "ground_truth": "The first five composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10. Their prime factorizations are $2^2, 2\\cdot 3, 2^3, 3^2$, and $2\\cdot 5$. Taking the maximum exponent for each prime, we find that the least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5=\\boxed{360}$."
