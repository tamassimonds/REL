    "working_out": "First, let's break down the problem. The question is asking us to find the constant \\( c \\) such that the quadratic \\( x^2 + cx + 9c \\) is the square of a binomial. This means it's equivalent to some expression of the form \\((ax + b)^2\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- My first thought is to try to think about what the square of a binomial looks like. A binomial squared, \\((ax + b)^2\\), would expand to \\(a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2\\).\n  \n- We're given \\(x^2 + cx + 9c\\). I can immediately notice that there's a single \\(x^2\\) in both expressions, which suggests that this corresponds to the \\(a^2x^2\\) term. So, \\(a^2\\) should be 1 (because the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is just 1).\n\n### Explore and Understand\n\nSo let's start by setting \\(a = 1\\) since \\(a^2 = 1\\).\n\nNow, let's rewrite the binomial as \\((x + b)^2\\), which expands to:\n\\[ \n(x + b)^2 = x^2 + 2bx + b^2 \n\\]\n\nThe expression \\(x^2 + cx + 9c\\) should match this form:\n\\[\nx^2 + cx + 9c = x^2 + 2bx + b^2 \n\\]\n\nFrom comparing these, we obtain:\n- \\(c = 2b\\)\n- \\(9c = b^2\\)\n\n### Solving the System of Equations\n\nReflecting on this, I need to solve the system:\n1. \\(c = 2b\\)\n2. \\(9c = b^2\\)\n\nUsing substitution, if \\(c = 2b\\), substitute into the second equation:\n\\[\n9(2b) = b^2 \n\\]\n\\[\n18b = b^2\n\\]\n\nThis rearranges to:\n\\[\nb^2 - 18b = 0\n\\]\n\n### Factor and Solve\n\nThis can be factored as:\n\\[\nb(b - 18) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives solutions:\n- \\(b = 0\\) or \\(b = 18\\)\n\n#### Analyzing Solutions\n\n- If \\(b = 0\\), then \\(c = 2b = 0\\), which contradicts the nonzero condition for \\(c\\).\n\n- If \\(b = 18\\), then:\n  - \\(c = 2b = 36\\)\n  \n  Let\u2019s check if this satisfies all conditions:\n  - Substitute \\(c = 36\\) into \\(9c = b^2\\):\n  \n  \\[ \n  b^2 = 18^2 = 324 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  9c = 9 \\times 36 = 324\n  \\]\n\nThis works perfectly, so \\(c = 36\\) is consistent with all conditions.\n\n### Verifying\n\nFinally, verify by plugging \\(c = 36\\) back into the original expression:\n- Original: \\(x^2 + 36x + 324\\)\n- Supposed to match: \\((x + 18)^2 = x^2 + 36x + 324\\)\n\nYes, this checks out.\n\nSo, the answer is \\(c = 36\\). I'm confident this solution is correct after checking each step and the overall reasoning aligns with the conditions given.",

  "ground_truth": "If $x^2+cx+9c$ is the square of a binomial, then because the coefficient of $x^2$ is $1$, the binomial must be of the form $x+a$ for some $a$. So, we have $$(x+a)^2 = x^2+cx+9c.$$Expanding the left side, we have $$x^2 + 2ax + a^2 = x^2 + cx + 9c.$$The coefficients of $x$ must agree, so $2a=c$. Also, the constant terms must agree, so $a^2=9c$, giving $c=\\frac{a^2}{9}$. We have two expressions for $c$ in terms of $a$, so we set them equal to each other: $$2a = \\frac{a^2}{9}.$$To solve for $a$, we subtract $2a$ from both sides: $$0 = \\frac{a^2}{9} - 2a$$and then factor: $$0 = a\\left(\\frac{a}{9}-2\\right),$$which has solutions $a=0$ and $a=18$.\n\nFinally, we have $c=2a$, so $c=0$ or $c=36$. But we are looking for a nonzero answer, so we can reject $c=0$. We obtain $c=\\boxed{36}$.\n\n(Checking, we find that $x^2+36x+9\\cdot 36$ is indeed equal to $(x+18)^2$.)"
