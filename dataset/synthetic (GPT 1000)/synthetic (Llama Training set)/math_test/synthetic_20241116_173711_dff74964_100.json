    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and break it down step by step.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\n- This problem involves a parabola with the equation \\(x = -y^2 + 4y - 4\\). Unlike the typical parabola equation \\(y=ax^2+bx+c\\), this one is in terms of \\(x\\), meaning it represents a \"sideways\" or horizontal parabola.\n- I know that a \\(y\\)-intercept happens when \\(x = 0\\), so the task is to find out how many times the graph of this equation crosses the \\(y\\)-axis.\n\n### Initial Strategy\n\n1. **Substitute \\(x = 0\\) Into the Equation:**\n   - Since \\(y\\)-intercepts are points on the \\(y\\)-axis where \\(x = 0\\), the first step is to set \\(x = 0\\) in the equation and solve for \\(y\\).\n   - The equation becomes \\(0 = -y^2 + 4y - 4\\).\n\n2. **Rearranging and Solving the Equation:**\n   - To solve this, I'll rearrange it to make a standard quadratic equation: \n     \\[\n     y^2 - 4y + 4 = 0\n     \\]\n   - This looks solvable; I recognize it as a quadratic, so I'm thinking \\(y^2 - 4y + 4 = 0\\) is the form \\( (y-2)^2 = 0 \\).\n\n### Solving the Quadratic Equation\n\n- **Factor the Quadratic Equation:**\n  - Let's see if it factors nicely. \n  - The quadratic \\(y^2 - 4y + 4\\) factors into \\((y-2)(y-2)\\) or \\((y-2)^2 = 0\\).\n  - Solving this gives \\(y - 2 = 0\\), or \\(y = 2\\).\n\n### Analyzing the Solution\n\n- **Evaluate the Solution:**\n  - I found \\(y = 2\\) as the only solution. This suggests that the graph of the parabola touches the \\(y\\)-axis at exactly one point: when \\(y = 2\\).\n\n- **Check for Mistakes:**\n  - I factored the quadratic expression to \\((y-2)^2\\), and set it to zero to find \\(y = 2\\).\n  - Since the squared factor resulted in a single solution, this means there's only a single \\(y\\)-value that satisfies \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Reflect on the Result\n\n- **Reflections and Verification:**\n  - This approach seems correct. We know that if the quadratic terms yield a perfect square, the parabola only touches the axis tangentially.\n  - Therefore, the graph of the parabola indeed touches the \\(y\\)-axis in just one spot.\n\n- **Consider an Alternative Verification:**\n  - An alternative method could involve calculating the vertex of the parabola to confirm, but given that the quadratic perfectly factored, more steps aren't necessary.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe graph of the parabola \\(x = -y^2 + 4y - 4\\) has exactly **one \\(y\\)-intercept**, which occurs at \\(y = 2\\). This was deduced by solving the quadratic equation after setting \\(x\\) to 0, and confirming this intersection point by verifying the obtained solution and considering the geometric interpretation of a parabola that just touches an axis at a single point (vertex).",

  "ground_truth": "A $y$-intercept is a point on the graph that lies on the $y$-axis, so $x = 0$.  Hence, the number $y$-intercepts corresponds to the number of real solutions of the quadratic equation $-y^2 + 4y - 4$.  The discriminant of this quadratic equation is $4^2 - 4 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-4) = 0$, so the quadratic has exactly one real root.  (We can also see this by writing $-y^2 + 4y - 4 = -(y - 2)^2$.)  Therefore, the number of $y$-intercepts is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\nreal ticklen=3;\nreal tickspace=2;\n\nreal ticklength=0.1cm;\nreal axisarrowsize=0.14cm;\npen axispen=black+1.3bp;\nreal vectorarrowsize=0.2cm;\nreal tickdown=-0.5;\nreal tickdownlength=-0.15inch;\nreal tickdownbase=0.3;\nreal wholetickdown=tickdown;\nvoid rr_cartesian_axes(real xleft, real xright, real ybottom, real ytop, real xstep=1, real ystep=1, bool\n\nuseticks=false, bool complexplane=false, bool usegrid=true) {\n\nimport graph;\n\nreal i;\n\nif(complexplane) {\n\nlabel(\"$\\textnormal{Re}$\",(xright,0),SE);\n\nlabel(\"$\\textnormal{Im}$\",(0,ytop),NW);\n\n} else {\n\nlabel(\"$x$\",(xright+0.4,-0.5));\n\nlabel(\"$y$\",(-0.5,ytop+0.2));\n\n}\n\nylimits(ybottom,ytop);\n\nxlimits( xleft, xright);\n\nreal[] TicksArrx,TicksArry;\n\nfor(i=xleft+xstep; i<xright; i+=xstep) {\n\nif(abs(i) >0.1) {\n\nTicksArrx.push(i);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nfor(i=ybottom+ystep; i<ytop; i+=ystep) {\n\nif(abs(i) >0.1) {\n\nTicksArry.push(i);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nif(usegrid) {\n\nxaxis(BottomTop(extend=false), Ticks(\"%\", TicksArrx ,pTick=gray\n\n(0.22),extend=true),p=invisible);//,above=true);\n\nyaxis(LeftRight(extend=false),Ticks(\"%\", TicksArry ,pTick=gray(0.22),extend=true),\n\np=invisible);//,Arrows);\n\n}\n\nif(useticks) {\n\nxequals(0, ymin=ybottom, ymax=ytop, p=axispen, Ticks(\"%\",TicksArry ,\n\npTick=black+0.8bp,Size=ticklength), above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\nyequals(0, xmin=xleft, xmax=xright, p=axispen, Ticks(\"%\",TicksArrx ,\n\npTick=black+0.8bp,Size=ticklength), above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\n} else {\n\nxequals(0, ymin=ybottom, ymax=ytop, p=axispen, above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\nyequals(0, xmin=xleft, xmax=xright, p=axispen, above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\n}\n};\nreal lowerx, upperx, lowery, uppery;\nreal f(real x) {return -x^2 + 4*x - 4;}\nlowery = -1;\nuppery = 5;\nrr_cartesian_axes(-9,2,lowery,uppery);\ndraw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*(graph(f,lowery,uppery,operator ..)), red);\n[/asy]"
