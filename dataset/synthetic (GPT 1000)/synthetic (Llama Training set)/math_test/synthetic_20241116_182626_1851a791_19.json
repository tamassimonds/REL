    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem by breaking it down step by step. \n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n\nFirst, let's take a close look at the problem. We have two circles with spinners that are divided into three equal regions. The values on these regions represent the numbers we get when the spinners land, and we want to determine the probability that their product is negative. \n\nThis kind of problem seems familiar; it's somewhat related to probability problems in games involving cards or dice, where outcomes combine to meet a certain condition. My approach will need to focus on understanding the negative product condition and then counting outcomes. \n\n### Step 1: Explore the Structure and Possible Outcomes\n\nLet's start by identifying the numbers on each spinner. According to the description:\n\n- First spinner: \\(-1\\), \\(-3\\), \\(5\\)\n- Second spinner: \\(2\\), \\(4\\), \\(-6\\)\n\nSince each circle is divided into three regions, each number has an equal chance of being selected. There are therefore \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) combinations for the pairs of numbers that can be spun.\n\n### Step 2: Condition for a Negative Product\n\nThe product of two numbers is negative if and only if one number is positive and the other is negative. So, we need to identify when one spinner gives a negative number and the other gives a positive number.\n\nFor each spinner, let's distinguish which numbers are positive and which are negative:\n\n- First spinner: Negative numbers are \\(-1\\), \\(-3\\); Positive number is \\(5\\).\n- Second spinner: Positive numbers are \\(2\\), \\(4\\); Negative number is \\(-6\\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine Specific Combinations\n\nWe must calculate the probability that the product of the numbers from the two spinners is negative.\n\n**Combination analysis:**\n\n1. **First spinner negative, second spinner positive:**\n\n   - First spinner gives \\(-1\\) or \\(-3\\).\n   - Second spinner gives \\(2\\) or \\(4\\).\n\n    Combinations:\n    - \\((-1, 2)\\), \\((-1, 4)\\)\n    - \\((-3, 2)\\), \\((-3, 4)\\)\n\n    Total: 4 successful outcomes \n\n2. **First spinner positive, second spinner negative:**\n\n   - First spinner gives \\(5\\).\n   - Second spinner gives \\(-6\\).\n\n    Combination:\n    - \\((5, -6)\\)\n\n    Total: 1 successful outcome\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Probability\n\nOut of the 9 total outcomes (from all possible combinations of spins), we determined that 5 outcomes result in a negative product.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product is negative is:\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of negative product outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{5}{9}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Reflect and Review\n\nLet's recap our solution process: We identified all the number values on each spinner, recognized which pairings would produce a negative product, and calculated the probability from our successful pairings over the total possible outcomes.\n\nThe logic of recognizing one number must be positive and the other negative seems sound across both spinners. Our calculated probability, \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\), aligns well with the sample space reasoning.\n\nEverything seems consistent, so I believe the \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\) solution is correct. \n\nFinal answer: The probability is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "There are nine possible products, as there are three different numbers upon which the first spinner could land and three different numbers upon which the second spinner could land. If the first spinner lands on $-3$ or $-1$, the second spinner can land on either 2 or 4 to create a negative product, giving four possibilities. If the first spinner lands on the 5, the second spinner must land on the $-6$ to create a negative product. Thus, there are five possible ways to create a negative product, so the probability that the product of the values is negative is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$."
