    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, it looks like a classic geometry problem involving the properties of midpoints. I remember that the midpoint formula is used when we have the endpoints of a line segment and need to find the midpoint, but it can also work in reverse to find a missing endpoint when given a midpoint and one endpoint. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- **Midpoint Concept**: The midpoint of a line segment is the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of the endpoints. So, if we have one endpoint and the midpoint, we should be able to reverse-engineer to find the other endpoint.\n  \n- **Given Information**: One endpoint is \\((6,8)\\), and the midpoint is \\((1,1)\\).\n\n- **Finding the Other Endpoint**: Let's denote the missing endpoint as \\((x, y)\\). Using the properties of midpoints, we can set up the formulas:\n  \\[\n  \\left(\\frac{6 + x}{2}, \\frac{8 + y}{2}\\right) = (1,1)\n  \\]\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Setup Equations:**\n   - For the x-coordinates:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{6 + x}{2} = 1\n     \\]\n   \n   - For the y-coordinates:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{8 + y}{2} = 1\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Solve the x-coordinate Equation:**\n   - Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n     \\[\n     6 + x = 2\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 6 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     x = 2 - 6 = -4\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the y-coordinate Equation:**\n   - Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n     \\[\n     8 + y = 2\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 8 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     y = 2 - 8 = -6\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - The other endpoint is \\((-4, -6)\\). Let's quickly verify if this works:\n     - Calculate the midpoint of \\((6,8)\\) and \\((-4, -6)\\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{6 + (-4)}{2}, \\frac{8 + (-6)}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{2}, \\frac{2}{2}\\right) = (1, 1)\n     \\]\n   - It matches the given midpoint, so the calculations appear to be correct.\n\n5. **Sum of the Coordinates:**\n   - To finish, add the coordinates of the other endpoint:\n     \\[\n     (-4) + (-6) = -10\n     \\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- Everything checks out correctly. Initially, my instinct about reversing the midpoint calculation process was correct. I carefully verified the midpoint calculations, and they fit perfectly. \n\n- The problem was straightforward once broken down, but each minor detail, particularly ensuring the algebra was accurately handled, was crucial.\n\nThe sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint is \\(-10\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Let the other endpoint have coordinates $(x,y)$. We have the equations $(x+6)/2=1$ and $(y+8)/2=1$, or $x=-4$ and $y=-6$. The sum of the coordinates is thus $-4+(-6)=\\boxed{-10}$."
