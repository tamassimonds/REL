    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst off, I need to find the function value \\( f(8) \\) for the function defined as \\( f(x) = 3\\sqrt{2x - 7} - 8 \\). My task is to substitute \\( x = 8 \\) into this function and evaluate it.\n\nOkay, this seems straightforward: substitute and simplify. But let's think for a second about the structure of the function. We have a square root wrapped inside a linear transformation (multiplying by 3 and subtracting 8). This actually reminds me of evaluating and simplifying expressions in algebra, so I feel fairly confident about diving in.\n\n**Step 2: Substituting the Value**\n\nLet's substitute \\( x = 8 \\) into the function:\n\\[ f(8) = 3\\sqrt{2(8) - 7} - 8 \\]\n\nI first multiply inside the square root:\n\\[ 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\nSo now the expression inside the square root is:\n\\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\]\n\nSubstituting back, we get:\n\\[ f(8) = 3\\sqrt{9} - 8 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplifying the Expression**\n\nGreat, now let's simplify this. The square root of 9 is 3, because \\( 3^2 = 9 \\).\n\nSo now the expression is:\n\\[ f(8) = 3 \\times 3 - 8 \\]\n\nAlright, that simplifies further to:\n\\[ f(8) = 9 - 8 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nFinally, just compute the subtraction:\n\\[ f(8) = 1 \\]\n\n**Step 5: Reflecting and Double-Checking**\n\nWait, let\u2019s pause and double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Substituted correctly, check; simplified the square root correctly, check; performed the arithmetic correctly... everything seems to flow logically, and the numbers seem reasonable.\n\nI think we've answered the question: \\( f(8) = 1 \\).\n\nGreat, very straightforward problem but a good exercise in substituting and simplifying expressions. I'm confident the solution is correct.",
