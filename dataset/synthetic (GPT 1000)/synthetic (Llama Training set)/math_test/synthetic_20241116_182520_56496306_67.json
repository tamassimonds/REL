    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and approach it step by step.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, it reminds me of the distance formula between two points. The problem seems to be about calculating possible values for `b` such that the distance between the two given points is 5. This feels quite similar to problems I've solved before involving coordinates and distances.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe have two points: \\((1, 2)\\) and \\((4, b)\\). We need to ensure that the length of the line segment between these points is 5. The length or distance between points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the points into the formula:\n\n\\[\n5 = \\sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (b - 2)^2}\n\\]\n\n**Strategizing:**\n\nTo extract the value of `b`, I'll first simplify the expression under the square root and then solve for `b`. The strategy involves isolating `b` after squaring both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. Simplify the expression under the square root:\n   - Calculate \\((4 - 1)^2 = 3^2 = 9\\).\n\n2. Now we have:\n   \\[\n   5 = \\sqrt{9 + (b - 2)^2}\n   \\]\n\n3. Square both sides to remove the square root:\n   \\[\n   5^2 = 9 + (b - 2)^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   25 = 9 + (b - 2)^2\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract 9 from both sides to isolate \\((b - 2)^2\\):\n   \\[\n   25 - 9 = (b - 2)^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   16 = (b - 2)^2\n   \\]\n\n5. At this point, it feels good. Solving for \\(b\\), take the square root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   b - 2 = \\pm 4\n   \\]\n\n6. Solve for `b` in two scenarios:\n   - **Scenario 1:**\n     \\[\n     b - 2 = 4 \\implies b = 4 + 2 = 6\n     \\]\n   - **Scenario 2:**\n     \\[\n     b - 2 = -4 \\implies b = -4 + 2 = -2\n     \\]\n\n7. Inspect possible values of `b`: The solutions here are \\(b = 6\\) and \\(b = -2\\).\n\n**Verification:**\n\nIt's always smart to double-check our results. Plug the possible values back into the original distance formula:\n\n- For \\(b = 6\\):\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (6-2)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n  \\]\n  This checks out.\n\n- For \\(b = -2\\):\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (-2-2)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n  \\]\n  This also checks out.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth calculations confirm our findings and both values satisfy the initial condition. The possible values of \\(b\\) are \\(\\boxed{6, -2}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{ (4-1)^2 + (b-2)^2 } = 5$. Solving, we get $3^2 + (b-2)^2 = 5^2$. $(b-2)^2 = 16$, so $b-2=4$ or $b-2=-4$. Solving, we get that $b is one of \\boxed{6, -2}$."
