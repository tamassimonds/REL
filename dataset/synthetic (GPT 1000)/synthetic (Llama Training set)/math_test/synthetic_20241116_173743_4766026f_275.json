    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving the problem \\(\\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{3}\\). Right off the bat, I recognize this is a problem of adding fractions with different denominators. It's a classic problem type that I've certainly tackled before. The key here is finding a common denominator.\n\n### Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:** \n   - We're adding two fractions: \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n   - The denominators (5 and 3) are different, which means I need a common denominator to add them directly.\n\n2. **Common Denominator Approach:**\n   - To add fractions, they need the same denominator. So, let's find the least common denominator (LCD) for 5 and 3.\n   - The least common multiple (LCM) is a good starting point. This requires me to multiply or find a suitable number that's divisible by both 5 and 3.\n\n3. **Compute the LCM:**\n   - 5 and 3 are both primes, which often means the LCM is their product unless there's a smaller shared multiple.\n   - Calculating: \\( 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\). Since 15 is divisible by both 5 and 3, 15 will be our common denominator.\n\n### Converting to Common Denominator\n\n4. **Convert each Fraction:**\n   - For \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) -> I need to convert this into a fraction with a denominator of 15.\n   - Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3 (since \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\)): \n     \\[\n     \\frac{2 \\times 3}{5 \\times 3} = \\frac{6}{15}\n     \\]\n\n   - For \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) -> Convert this fraction to have a denominator of 15 as well.\n   - Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 5 (since \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\)):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1 \\times 5}{3 \\times 5} = \\frac{5}{15}\n     \\]\n\n### Adding the Fractions\n\n5. **Add the Modified Fractions:**\n   - Now that the denominators are the same, I can add them directly:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{6}{15} + \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{6 + 5}{15} = \\frac{11}{15}\n     \\]\n\n### Verification\n\n6. **Check the Work:**\n   - Everything adds up correctly. The new numerator 11 comes from adding the modified numerators 6 and 5.\n   - \\(\\frac{11}{15}\\) fully represents the addition since 11 is a prime number and doesn\u2019t simplify further over 15.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n7. **Reflection:**\n   - This approach worked well. I used the familiar method of finding a common denominator, and everything checked out on converting and adding the fractions.\n   - Is there another way I could have tested this result? Cross-verify with decimal equivalents: \n     - \\(\\frac{2}{5} = 0.4\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333\\), adding gives approximately 0.733.\n     - \\(\\frac{11}{15} \\approx 0.733\\), this lines up nicely.\n\nOverall, the process validated that the result \\(\\frac{11}{15}\\) is correct. This was a pretty standard example of adding fractions, and I feel confident in the method and the result.",
