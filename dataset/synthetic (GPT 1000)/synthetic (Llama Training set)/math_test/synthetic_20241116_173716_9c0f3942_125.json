    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. At first glance, we're dealing with a problem that involves understanding how a convex pentagon, specifically its sides, aligns or touches certain points on an axis after a series of transformations.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the problem\nWe're given a convex pentagon with specific side lengths. It's positioned on the plane in a particular way: vertex \\(A\\) starts at the origin, and \\(B\\) is on the positive \\(x\\)-axis. The pentagon is then \"rolled\" along the \\(x\\)-axis. We need to determine which side of the pentagon touches the point \\(x = 2009\\).\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorming approaches\n1. **Visualize the motion**: The pentagon rolls and each side touches the \\(x\\)-axis one after the other. Calculating the cumulative distance each side reaches as the pentagon rolls could help identify which side lies across \\(x = 2009\\).\n2. **Calculate Accumulated Distances**: As each side touches the \\(x\\)-axis, calculate the cumulative distance reached.\n3. **Check periodic behavior**: Since the pentagon is a fixed shape, after a complete set of sides touches down, it should reset. Knowing the total perimeter gives a cycle length.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate perimeter\n- **Perimeter**: Sum of all sides: \n  \\[ 3 + 4 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 23 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine cycles to reach near 2009\n- Each full cycle advances 23 units along the \\(x\\)-axis. We will see how many full cycles fit into 2009:\n  \\[\n  2009 \\div 23 \\approx 87.348\n  \\]\n  This means 87 full cycles with a remainder for the 88th.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate position after 87 full cycles\n- After 87 cycles:\n  \\[\n  87 \\times 23 = 2001\n  \\]\n  At \\(x = 2001\\), a full set of sides have touched, and we are at the beginning of the cycle.\n\n### Step 6: Determine position in cycle for remaining distance\n- We need to cover:\n  \\[\n  2009 - 2001 = 8\n  \\]\n  Starting the new cycle at \\(x = 2001\\):\n  - **First side \\(AB = 3\\)** takes us to \\(2004\\).\n  - **Second side \\(BC = 4\\)** takes us to \\(2008\\).\n  - **Third side \\(CD = 6\\)** would start at \\(2008\\).\n\nThe third side \\(CD\\) starts here and covers the point \\(x = 2009\\).\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\n- Upon rolling the 88th time, side \\(CD\\) is active when the pentagon reaches \\(x = 2009\\).\n\nSo, the side that touches \\(x = 2009\\) is \"CD\".\n\nChecking my work: \n- Every step considered distance and placement logically.\n- Calculations align with understanding of rolling perimeter cycles.\n- \\(x = 2009\\) falls precisely into the segment covered next by \\(CD\\). \n\nThere we have it, after the analysis and steps, the answer is indeed **CD**.",

  "ground_truth": "Side $\\overline{AB}$ covers the interval $[0,3],$ then $\\overline{BC}$ covers the interval $[3,7],$ then $\\overline{CD}$ covers the interval $[7,13],$ then $\\overline{DE}$ covers the interval $[13,16],$ then $\\overline{EA}$ covers the interval $[16,23],$ and then the process repeats.  The intervals the sides touch repeat with period 23.\n\nSince $2009 = 87 \\cdot 23 + 8,$ side $\\boxed{\\overline{CD}}$ touches the point 2009."
