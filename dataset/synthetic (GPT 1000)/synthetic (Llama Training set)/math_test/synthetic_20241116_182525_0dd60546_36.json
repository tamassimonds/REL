    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem by thinking through it carefully and methodically, just like how we would approach it naturally.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts: We've got two fair six-sided dice, and the language of the problem tells us that we're interested in finding the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled. Ah, okay, so this isn't just about the average roll value, but specifically about the larger value of the two rolls. If the dice are the same, that's fine, we still consider that same number.\n\nHmm, what might be useful... Oh! This problem has symmetry, right? Each die is fair, so the situation is symmetric between the two dice. \n\n**Step 2: Consider Basic Strategies**\n\nLet\u2019s brainstorm a bit. \n\n- I could try to write out all possible outcomes and just list which is larger in each case \u2013 but with two dice and each having six sides, that's 6 * 6 = 36 outcomes, not trivial by hand without a system. So listing everything isn't practical unless I automate it or get super organized.\n  \n- Maybe I can calculate it by considering each die separately and think probabilistically about which one is larger... \n\n**Step 3: Break Down by Outcomes**\n\nAlright, let's think systematically about how to break it down.\n\nOh! I can handle it this way: for each possible result of the larger die, calculate the probability of that being the outcome.\n\n**Step 4: Count Outcomes**\n\n- Rolling a 1: The only way is rolling (1,1). There's 1 outcome.\n  \n- Rolling a 2: This can happen by (1,2), (2,1), or (2,2). Three outcomes satisfy this.\n  \n- Rolling a 3: This can happen by (1,3), (3,1), (2,3), (3,2), or (3,3). Five outcomes satisfy this.\n  \n- Rolling a 4: This can happen by (1,4), (4,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,4), (4,3), or (4,4). Seven outcomes satisfy this.\n\n- Rolling a 5: This can happen by (1,5), (5,1), (2,5), (5,2), (3,5), (5,3), (4,5), (5,4), or (5,5). Nine outcomes satisfy this.\n  \n- Rolling a 6: This can happen by (1,6), (6,1), (2,6), (6,2), (3,6), (6,3), (4,6), (6,4), (5,6), (6,5), or (6,6). Eleven outcomes satisfy this.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate Expected Value**\n\nSo, let's tally these outcomes. We have 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 = 36 outcomes (phew, double-check, it matches 36, so approach is consistent).\n\nCalculating expected value now:\n\n\\[ \nE = \\frac{1}{36} \\left(1 \\times 1 + 3 \\times 2 + 5 \\times 3 + 7 \\times 4 + 9 \\times 5 + 11 \\times 6 \\right) \n\\]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1}{36} (1 + 6 + 15 + 28 + 45 + 66) \n\\]\n\nSum that up:\n\n\\[\n1 + 6 + 15 + 28 + 45 + 66 = 161\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the expected value E:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{161}{36}\n\\]\n\nNow, simplify: \n\nOh, it doesn't simplify easily, so let's see that:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{161}{36}\n\\]\n\nAnd checking it \u2013 hold on, does that make sense given the context? Calculate again for accuracy and double-check, simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{161}{36} \n\\]\n\nAfter simplification, they seem to share no common factors (quick brainstorm with smaller numbers and division test).\n\nFinally, think... is this approach consistently logical with this set-up, and is there something I've overlooked? Feels right given symmetry and setup.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSo final answer: The expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled is \\( \\frac{161}{36} \\). That's it!",

  "ground_truth": "There are 36 possible outcomes for the two dice. Of these, there is 1 where both dice roll a six, 5 where the first die rolls a six and the other rolls something less than a six, and 5 more where the second die rolls a six and the first die rolls something less than a six. So, there are a total of $1+5+5=11$ ways the larger number rolled can be a six. Similarly, there are $1+4+4=9$ ways the larger number rolled can be a five, $1+3+3=7$ ways the larger number rolled can be a four, $1+2+2=5$ ways the larger number rolled can be a three, $1+1+1=3$ ways the larger number rolled can be a two, and $1$ way the larger number rolled can be a one. The expected value of the larger number is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{36}(11(6)+9(5)&+7(4)+5(3)+3(2)+1(1))\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{36}(66+45+28+15+6+1)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{161}{36}}\n\\end{align*}"
