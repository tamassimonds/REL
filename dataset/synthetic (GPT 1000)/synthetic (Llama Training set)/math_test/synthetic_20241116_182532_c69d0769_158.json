    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with our initial thoughts and strategies.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- This expression looks like something I've seen before, where we write a quadratic in a completed square form. It\u2019s been a little while since I did these types of problems; let's try to unpick it slowly.\n- The quadratic expression \\(-2x^2 - 20x - 53\\) needs to be rewritten in the form \\(a(x+d)^2+e\\). I remember completing the square involves creating a perfect square trinomial.\n- I think I'll have to rearrange or manipulate this expression to get it into the required form.\n\n**Brainstorming Possible Strategies:**\n\n- Completing the Square: This might be the way to go. I remember it involves taking half of the \\(x\\) coefficient, squaring it, and using that to form the square.\n- Another possibility is using vertex form directly, but I think completing the square is what we're meant to do here.\n\nLet's start with completing the square.\n\n**Completing the Square:**\n\n1. **Focus on the quadratic and linear terms**, \\(-2x^2 - 20x\\):\n\n   - Initially, rewrite the expression factoring out \\(-2\\) from the first two terms: \n     \\[\n     -2(x^2 + 10x) - 53\n     \\]\n\n2. **Attempt to complete the square within the parentheses:**\n\n   - Look at \\(x^2 + 10x\\). Here, I remember I need half of the \\(x\\) coefficient: \\(10 / 2 = 5\\).\n   - Square this value to complete the square: \\(5^2 = 25\\).\n\n3. **Adjust the equation to account for this change:**\n\n   - Add and subtract the 25 inside the parentheses. This won't change the equation but will allow forming the square:\n     \\[\n     -2(x^2 + 10x + 25 - 25) - 53 \n     \\]\n   - Simplify inside the bracket: \n     \\[\n     -2((x+5)^2 - 25) - 53\n     \\]\n\n4. **Expand and simplify the expression:**\n\n   - Distribute the \\(-2\\):\n     \\[\n     -2(x+5)^2 + 50 - 53 \n     \\]\n   - Simplify the entire expression:\n     \\[\n     -2(x+5)^2 - 3\n     \\]\n\n**Final Reflections and Checks:**\n\n- Now, the expression \\(-2(x+5)^2 - 3\\) is in the form \\(a(x+d)^2+e\\), where \\(a = -2\\), \\(d = 5\\), and \\(e = -3\\).\n- This seems like everything worked out correctly!\n\n5. **Calculate the sum of the constants \\(a + d + e\\):**\n\n   - Now for the final step: \n     \\[\n     a + d + e = -2 + 5 - 3 = 0\n     \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Reflecting on this process, I followed the steps for completing the square correctly, and the final calculation seems logical and matches my expectations.\n- The sum \\(a + d + e\\) is \\(0\\).\n\nThat feels good! Each step aligned well with the math checks, and the numbers make sense. I'm confident this is the correct approach and solution overall.",

  "ground_truth": "We will complete the square to rewrite the given expression in standard form. Factoring out a -2 from the first two terms, we have \\[-2(x^2+10x)-53\\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(10/2)^2=25$ inside the parenthesis: \\[-2(x^2+10x+25-25)-53 =-2(x+5)^2 -3 \\]Thus, $a=-2$, $d=5$, and $e=-3$, so the sum $a+d+e$ is $-2+5+(-3)=\\boxed{0}$."
