    "working_out": "### Brainstorming\n\nAlright, let's break this down. We have two quadratic equations in terms of \\(x\\):\n\n1. \\(9x^2 - 18x - 16 = 0\\)\n2. \\(15x^2 + 28x + 12 = 0\\)\n\nThese equations seemingly have a common solution \\(x\\), as the problem suggests finding a value that satisfies both simultaneously. \n\n### Initial Approach\n\nOne immediate thought is that these quadratic equations may share a common root. So perhaps finding the roots of each equation and checking if they match could work. But solving quadratics directly might be tricky without seeing any apparent simplifications or identities.\n\nTo start, I think I'll solve both equations separately and see what roots they offer.\n\n### Solving the Equations\n\n#### Equation 1: \\(9x^2 - 18x - 16 = 0\\)\n\nLet's use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 9\\), \\(b = -18\\), \\(c = -16\\).\n\nFirst, compute the discriminant:\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-18)^2 - 4 \\times 9 \\times (-16)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 324 + 576 = 900\n\\]\n\nThis is a perfect square (30\u00b2), so great, it will result in rational roots.\n\nNow, applying the formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-18) \\pm \\sqrt{900}}{2 \\times 9} = \\frac{18 \\pm 30}{18}\n\\]\n\nSolving gives two roots:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{48}{18} = \\frac{8}{3} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-12}{18} = \\frac{-2}{3}\n\\]\n\n#### Equation 2: \\(15x^2 + 28x + 12 = 0\\)\n\nAgain, use the quadratic formula with \\(a = 15\\), \\(b = 28\\), \\(c = 12\\).\n\nCompute the discriminant:\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = 28^2 - 4 \\times 15 \\times 12\n\\]\n\\[\n= 784 - 720 = 64\n\\]\n\nThis is also a perfect square (8\u00b2).\n\nNow, using the formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-28 \\pm \\sqrt{64}}{2 \\times 15} = \\frac{-28 \\pm 8}{30}\n\\]\n\nSolving gives two roots:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-20}{30} = \\frac{-2}{3} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-36}{30} = \\frac{-6}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Cross-Checking the Roots\n\nNow, the roots from the first equation are \\(\\frac{8}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{-2}{3}\\), while the roots from the second equation are \\(\\frac{-2}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{-6}{5}\\).\n\nThe common root here is \\(\\frac{-2}{3}\\). So, this is the value of \\(x\\) that satisfies both equations simultaneously.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nEverything seems to check out\u2014both equations share \\(\\frac{-2}{3}\\) as a common solution. Thus, the solution to the problem is \\(x = \\frac{-2}{3}\\).\n\nFinal answer:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-2}{3}\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "We solve each equation separately. First off, we have $9x^2 - 18x - 16 = (3x+2)(3x-8) = 0.$ We can also see that $15x^2+28x+12 = (3x+2)(5x+6) = 0.$ It is clear that both equations are satisfied only when $3x + 2 = 0,$ therefore $x = \\boxed{-\\dfrac{2}{3}}.$"
