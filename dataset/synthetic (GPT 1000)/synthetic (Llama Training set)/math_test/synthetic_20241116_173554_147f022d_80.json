We have the expression \\(\\left(\\frac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2\\) and our goal is to evaluate it. This is essentially raising a complex number to the power of 2.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Thoughts and Setup\nHmm, when we deal with powers, it often involves multiplying the expression by itself. That's basic exponent rules. Also, since we have complex numbers here, I should remember that \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit where \\(i^2 = -1\\).\n\n### Step 3: Setting Up the Squaring Process\nLet's write this out explicitly for clarity:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{-2i}{5}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{-2i}{5}\\right)\n\\]\n\nAt this point, I need to multiply these two fractions together.\n\n### Step 4: Performing the Multiplication\nMultiplying fractions means multiplying the numerators together and the denominators together separately:\n\nThe numerator is:\n\\[\n(-2i) \\times (-2i) = (-2 \\times -2) \\times (i \\times i) = 4 \\times i^2\n\\]\n\nThe denominator is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 5 = 25\n\\]\n\nCollecting these, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{4 \\times i^2}{25}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplifying \\(i^2\\)\nRecall that \\(i^2 = -1\\). So, substituting this into our expression gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4 \\times (-1)}{25} = \\frac{-4}{25}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Reflecting on the Results\nThis seems pretty straightforward actually. Let's reflect: the expression \\(\\left(\\frac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2\\) simplifies down to a real number. Complex number handling is tricky, but here everything calculated correctly. A quick mental check shows the steps were logical and valid for manipulating these numbers.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nFinally, our evaluated expression \\(\\left(\\frac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2\\) results in the real number:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{-4}{25}}\n\\]\n\nThis makes sense because squaring the imaginary part coupled with the properties of \\(i\\) naturally simplified back to a real value. \n\nReflecting back, perhaps there wasn't really another method required for such a direct problem. But understanding the basic arithmetic intricacies especially involving imaginary numbers is what each step confirmed.",
