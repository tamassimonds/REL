    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- I immediately recognize this as a polynomial interpolation problem because we need to find a specific value (\\(p(10)\\)) of a polynomial given certain conditions.\n- The function \\(p(x)\\) is a polynomial of degree 8 satisfying \\(p(n) = \\frac{1}{n}\\) for \\(n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\). This looks related to problems I've seen before regarding constructing polynomials through Lagrange interpolation or similar methods.\n- Seems like classic Lagrange Polynomial case to approach finding values based on known points.\n\nBrainstorming Approach:\n- Construct the polynomial \\(p(x)\\) using the conditions. The degree being 8 suggests the polynomial will be centered around the points \\(n=1\\) to \\(n=9\\).\n- One approach might be to use Lagrange interpolation: form the polynomial as a sum of terms \\(\\frac{1}{n} L_n(x)\\) where each \\(L_n(x)\\) is the Lagrange basis polynomial.\n- However, directly applying Lagrange might seem complex and computationally intensive. Why don't I consider if any symmetries or substitutions exist?\n\nAttempt a different strategy:\n- Build a new function \\(q(x) = x \\cdot p(x) - 1\\). This helps because it ensures \\(q(n) = 0\\) for \\(n=1, 2, \\dots, 9\\).\n- I notice \\(q(x)\\) is a polynomial with zeroes at these points and hence factor it as \\(q(x) = c(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-9)\\).\n\nRe-evaluate and Refocus:\n- Realization!! The key might be in observing \\(q(x)\\). The \\(x \\cdot p(x) - 1\\) being zero exactly at integers implies a root structure is simple multiplication of these factors (the roots).\n- This structure ensures my \\(p(x)\\) is actually factoring the known differences into a nicely evaluated form without constructing each term individually, simplifying the job of understanding \\(c\\).\n\nCalculate \\(c\\):\n- Since \\(q(x) = x \\cdot p(x) - 1\\) translates into a higher-order polynomial factored by known zeros, check \\(c\\) by matching terms using a representative \\(n\\). Taking specific cases like \\(x=10\\) helps because \\(q(x) = x\\cdot\\left(p(x)\\right)-1\\) must transit to zero condition by canceling the natural alignment within integer solutions.\n- \\(p(x) = \\frac{1}{x} (x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-9) + \\frac{1}{x}\\).\n\nSolving further:\n- Final substitute back for \\(x=10\\) puts:\n\\[ q(10) = 10\\cdot p(10) - 1 = c(10-1)(10-2)\\ldots(10-9) \\]\n\\[ q(10) = 0 \\Rightarrow p(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\]\n\nReflect if this makes sense:\n- With described constraints and structure, yes! The validation matched against factored conditions.\n- Logical checks on degree, zeroes at integer terms fit perfect result needs zero-check applying non-direct attempts.\n\nConclusion and Final Thoughts:\n- Yes, my gradual transformation through expected polynomial manipulation leads to finding \\(p(10) = \\frac{1}{10}\\).\n- Imposing \\(p(n) = \\frac{1}{n},\\, n=1,2,\\ldots9\\) conditions not directly computed repeat formulas validated factor exploration.\n- Each step refined further understanding and alternative view reinforced expected solution highlighted core calculation.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}\\).\n\nAhh, I see where I went off track. Let me reevaluate my solution, step-by-step, to find where the error occurred and incorporate a more accurate approach.\n\nPreviously, I had considered the polynomial \\(q(x) = x \\cdot p(x) - 1\\), recognizing that it must include the factor \\((x-1)(x-2)\\ldots(x-9)\\), because this results in zero at each \\(n=1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\). However, I miscomputed \\(p(10)\\) in deriving the value and missed an essential verification step.\n\nLet's reconsider this starting from setting up \\(q(x)\\) and find the constant \\(c\\).\n\n1. **Refocus on \\(q(x):**\n\n    \\(q(x) = x \\cdot p(x) - 1\\) is a polynomial of degree 9 and has zeros at \\(x=1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\). Therefore, we can express\n\n    \\[\n    q(x) = c(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-9)\n    \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Constant \\(c\\):**\n\n   Previously, I didn't use a comprehensive evaluation point to determine \\(c\\). Let's use \\(q(0)\\):\n\n    \\[\n    q(0) = 0 \\cdot p(0) - 1 = -1\n    \\]\n\n    Substituting \\(x=0\\) in the factorized form:\n\n    \\[\n    q(0) = c(-1)(-2)\\cdots(-9) = c(-9!)\n    \\]\n\n    Equating the two expressions for \\(q(0)\\):\n\n    \\[\n    -1 = c(-9!) \\implies c = \\frac{1}{9!}\n    \\]\n\n3. **Substitute for \\(p(10)\\):**\n\n   With known \\(c\\), our polynomial becomes\n\n    \\[\n    q(x) = \\frac{(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-9)}{9!}\n    \\]\n\n    To find \\(p(10)\\), evaluate \\(q(10)\\):\n\n    \\[\n    q(10) = \\frac{(10-1)(10-2)\\cdots(10-9)}{9!} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 1}{9!} = 1\n    \\]\n\n    Therefore, we resolve\n\n    \\[\n    10 \\cdot p(10) - 1 = 1 \\implies 10 \\cdot p(10) = 2 \\implies p(10) = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}\n    \\]\n\n4. **Reflect and Conclude:**\n\n   Ah, I see clearly now! The constant \\(c\\) was crucial, and the precise evaluation at \\(q(10)\\) confirmed our result. My revised answer, given the calculated polynomial setup and approach, is correctly:\n\n   \\[\n   p(10) = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}\n   \\]\n\nThis thorough method validated my previous oversight and fits perfectly within the constraints of polynomial behaviors and evaluations at given integers. Thank you for your patience as I worked through this more accurately!\n\nAlright, let's re-evaluate the problem and incorporate a more accurate approach.\n\nUpon reviewing my previous solution, I realized I made a computational error in evaluating \\(p(10)\\). I initially set up the function \\(q(x) = x \\cdot p(x) - 1\\) correctly, identifying that it should equal zero for \\(n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\), which led me to factor it as \\(q(x) = c(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-9)\\). However, I failed to correctly derive the constant \\(c\\) and calculate \\(p(10)\\).\n\nLet's delve back into solving the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Refocus on \\(q(x)\\):**\n\n   Since \\(q(x) = x \\cdot p(x) - 1\\) and it has roots at \\(x = 1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\), we indeed set:\n\n   \\[\n   q(x) = c(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-9)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Constant \\(c\\):**\n\n   We know:\n\n   \\[\n   q(0) = 0 \\cdot p(0) - 1 = -1\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting \\(x=0\\) into the factored form:\n\n   \\[\n   q(0) = c(-1)(-2)\\cdots(-9) = c(-9!)\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, solving for \\(c\\):\n\n   \\[\n   -1 = c(-9!) \\implies c = \\frac{1}{9!}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute for \\(p(10)\\):**\n\n   With \\(c\\) known, we express \\(q(x)\\):\n\n   \\[\n   q(x) = \\frac{(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-9)}{9!}\n   \\]\n\n   Evaluating at \\(x = 10\\):\n\n   \\[\n   q(10) = \\frac{(10-1)(10-2)\\cdots(10-9)}{9!} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 1}{9!} = 1\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, solving for \\(p(10)\\):\n\n   \\[\n   10 \\cdot p(10) - 1 = 1 \\implies 10 \\cdot p(10) = 2 \\implies p(10) = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Reflect and Validate:**\n\n   This approach corrects my earlier oversight and aligns with the polynomial's expected behavior and constraints. By accurately determining the constant \\(c\\) and using a deliberate evaluation at \\(q(10)\\), the solution verifies itself logically. Hence, the correct answer is indeed:\n\n   \\[\n   p(10) = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}\n   \\]\n\nBy revisiting the problem with clarity, I ensured that every step was logically consistent and validated against the polynomial's properties, confirming that \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) is indeed the correct value of \\(p(10)\\).",
