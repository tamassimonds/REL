    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem! When I encounter such problems, several approaches come to mind. Let's write down the given equation:  \n\n\\[\\frac{1}{x-1} + \\frac{2x}{x - 1} = 5.\\]  \n\nThis looks a little tricky due to the fractions. At first glance, it seems like it could be simplified by merging the fractions since they share a common denominator. That's what strikes me initially.\n\n### Step 1: Combining Fractions\n\nGiven they have a common denominator \\((x - 1)\\), it seems straightforward to combine them:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{x-1} + \\frac{2x}{x-1} = \\frac{1 + 2x}{x-1}.\\]  \n\nSo, our equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\\frac{1 + 2x}{x-1} = 5.\\]  \n\n### Step 2: Solving the Equation\n\nNow, it feels like we should eliminate the fraction to solve for \\(x\\). So the next step is to multiply both sides by \\((x - 1)\\), assuming \\(x \\neq 1\\) (since it would make the denominator zero and the expression undefined):\n\n\\[1 + 2x = 5(x - 1).\\]  \n\nA quick pause here to verify this step: Let's see, \\((x - 1)\\) was indeed the shared denominator, so multiplying through was a valid move. Let's proceed!\n\n### Step 3: Expanding and Rearranging\n\nNow, simplifying the right side, we have:\n\n\\[1 + 2x = 5x - 5.\\]  \n\nMy hunch is now to get all the terms involving \\(x\\) on one side and constant terms on the other:\n\n\\[1 + 2x = 5x - 5\\]  \\implies \\[2x - 5x = -5 - 1\\]  \\implies \\[-3x = -6.\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-6}{-3} = 2.\\]  \n\n### Step 5: Check the Solution\n\nAt this point, as a natural instinct, I want to check this solution back in the original equation to see if it makes sense. So, substituting \\(x = 2\\) back:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2 - 1} + \\frac{2(2)}{2 - 1} = \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{4}{1} = 1 + 4 = 5.\\]  \n\nAnd yes, it checks out perfectly!\n\n### Reflection\n\nEvery step seemed to work nicely, and the approach of combining the fractions early made it straightforward to solve. I didn't have to try an alternate approach since the initial steps smoothly led to a solution. By rechecking, I've confirmed \\(x = 2\\) is indeed the solution.\n\nIn conclusion, for solving equations with fractions, it's pretty efficient to combine fractions and eliminate them early through multiplication, assuming it's safe with respect to the domain (like checking for zero denominators).\n\nThis was a rewarding problem-solving process, and I feel confident in the correctness of the solution!",

  "ground_truth": "We can combine the two terms on the left side to get $\\dfrac{1+2x}{x-1} = 5$.  We then multiply both sides of this equation by $x-1$ to get rid of the fractions.   This gives us $1+2x = 5(x-1)$. Expanding the right side gives $1+2x = 5x -5$.  Subtracting $5x$ from both sides   gives $1-3x = -5$, and subtracting 1 from both sides of this equation yields $-3x = -6$.  Dividing both sides   of this equation by $-3$ gives us our answer, $x = \\boxed{2}$."
