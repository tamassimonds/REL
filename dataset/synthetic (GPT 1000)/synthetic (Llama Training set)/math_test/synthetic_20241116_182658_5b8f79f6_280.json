    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and really think it through. The expression to solve is \\((2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{21}) \\div 2^{17}\\).\n\n**First Impressions:**\n\n- At first glance, I'm noticing a lot of powers of 2 here. I remember something about powers being easily combined. This looks similar to algebra problems; maybe there\u2019s a way to simplify it.\n- I also know that when you divide expressions with the same base, you subtract exponents. I suspect that might be useful.\n\n**Step 1: Simplifying the Numerator**\n\nHmm, we have three \\(2^{20}\\) terms and one \\(2^{21}\\). This looks like it can be grouped together somehow:\n\n\\[2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{20}\\] can be combined as \\(3 \\times 2^{20}\\).\n\nThen there's the additional \\(2^{21}\\).\n\nThe numerator now looks like this: \\(3 \\times 2^{20} + 2^{21}\\).\n\nIs there more I can do here? Let me think:\n\n- \\(2^{21}\\) can be rewritten as \\(2 \\times 2^{20}\\). I could use this to my advantage here.\n\nSo, now the numerator can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[3 \\times 2^{20} + 2^{21} = 3 \\times 2^{20} + 2 \\times 2^{20}.\\]\n\nI can factor out \\(2^{20}\\):\n\n\\[2^{20} \\times (3 + 2) = 2^{20} \\times 5.\\]\n\n**Step 2: Dividing by \\(2^{17}\\)**\n\nNow that I've simplified the numerator to \\(5 \\times 2^{20}\\), I want to divide by \\(2^{17}\\). \n\nUsing the rule of dividing powers, where \\(a^m / a^n = a^{m-n}\\), I have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5 \\times 2^{20}}{2^{17}} = 5 \\times 2^{20-17}.\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[5 \\times 2^{3}.\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Final Expression**\n\nOkay, I've simplified the expression after dividing, and now it reads:\n\n\\[5 \\times 2^{3}.\\]\n\nCalculating \\(2^3\\):\n\n\\[2^3 = 8.\\]\n\nNow, multiplying by 5:\n\n\\[5 \\times 8 = 40.\\]\n\nSo, the final value of the expression is 40.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Everything seems to fit. The simplification particularly with \\(2^{20}\\) in the numerator turning into \\(5 \\times 2^{20}\\) was the key step.\n- My use of exponent rules was good, making the problem manageable.\n- Quick check: My division and multiplication all align perfectly to confirm the answer is correct.\n- After all this work, I feel confident that the answer is indeed 40.",

  "ground_truth": "As is often the case, calculating $2^{20}$ by brute force is not practical.  Instead, we will try simplifying the expression and combining some terms.  First, note that $2^{21} = 2 \\cdot 2^{20}$, because of the definition of an exponent.  So, we can rewrite the expression as $(2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2 \\cdot 2^{20}) \\div 2^{17} = 5 \\cdot 2^{20} \\div 2^{17}$.\n\nUsing the division of powers rule, that equals $5 \\cdot 2^{20-17} = 5 \\cdot 2^3 = 5 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{40}$."
