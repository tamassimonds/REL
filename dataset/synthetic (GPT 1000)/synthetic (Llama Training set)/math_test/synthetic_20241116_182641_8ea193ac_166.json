    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem step by step and let our thoughts unfold organically as we work through it.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst thoughts: This seems like an algebra problem involving exponents and simplifying expressions. The goal is to make the expression on the left equal to the one on the right and solve for the constants \\(r\\), \\(s\\), and \\(t\\).\n\nLet's write out and look at the expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{x^{r-2} \\cdot y^{2s} \\cdot z^{3t+1}}{x^{2r} \\cdot y^{s-4} \\cdot z^{2t-3}} = xyz\n\\]\n\nThe question is essentially about balancing powers of each variable \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Expression\nApproach: I have to breakdown the fractional expression into parts that deal with \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) separately.\n\nWrite down the powers of each variable in the expression:\n- For \\(x\\): \\(x^{r-2 - 2r}\\)\n- For \\(y\\): \\(y^{2s - (s-4)}\\)\n- For \\(z\\): \\(z^{3t+1 - (2t-3)}\\)\n\nEquate to the expression on the right: \n- \\(x^1\\), \\(y^1\\), and \\(z^1\\).\n\n### Step 3: Solving for \\(r\\), \\(s\\), and \\(t\\)\nLet\u2019s solve each power equation one at a time:\n\n**For \\(x\\):**\n\\[\nr - 2 - 2r = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -r - 2 = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -r = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r = -3\n\\]\n\n**For \\(y\\):**\n\\[\n2s - (s-4) = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2s - s + 4 = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad s + 4 = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad s = -3\n\\]\n\n**For \\(z\\):**\n\\[\n3t + 1 - (2t - 3) = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3t + 1 - 2t + 3 = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t + 4 = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t = -3\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Verification\nLet's check if these values make sense.\n\nSubstitute \\(r = -3\\), \\(s = -3\\), and \\(t = -3\\) back into the exponents:\n- For \\(x\\): \\((-3-2) - 2(-3) = -5 + 6 = 1\\), which is correct.\n- For \\(y\\): \\((2(-3)) - (-3-4) = -6 + 7 = 1\\), which is correct.\n- For \\(z\\): \\((3(-3)+1) - (2(-3)-3) = -9+1 + 6+3 = 1\\), which is correct.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating \\(r^s \\cdot t\\)\n\nWe have:\n- \\(r = -3\\)\n- \\(s = -3\\)\n- \\(t = -3\\)\n\nCalculate \\(r^s \\cdot t\\):\n\\[\n(-3)^{-3} \\cdot (-3) = \\left(\\frac{1}{-27}\\right) \\cdot (-3) = \\frac{1}{9}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solution for \\(r^s \\cdot t\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\).\n\nReflecting on the process, everything checks out mathematically, and all the steps feel consistent with the approach for simplifying exponents in algebra. Finding \\(r\\), \\(s\\), and \\(t\\) using basic algebra for solving equations worked well here.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we should solve for $r$, $s$, and $t$.  From what is given, we know that $\\frac{x^{r-2}}{x^{2r}}=x$, $\\frac{y^{2s}}{y^{s-4}}=y$, and $\\frac{z^{3t+1}}{z^{2t-3}}=z$. Solving for r, s, and t we have: \\begin{align*}\nr-2=2r+1\\Rightarrow r=-3\\\\\n2s=s-4+1\\Rightarrow s=-3\\\\\n3t+1=2t-3+1\\Rightarrow t=-3\\\\\n\\end{align*}Solving for $r^s\\cdot t$, we have $(-3)^{-3}\\cdot {-3}=\\frac{-1}{27}\\cdot {-3}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$."
