    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by taking it step by step. The key here is to translate the representations from different bases to base-10, and find the conditions where both representations equal the same integer.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are given that an integer \\( n \\) is represented as \\( 32_a \\) in base \\( a \\) and \\( 23_b \\) in base \\( b \\). We need to find such integer bases \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) (both greater than 3) such that \\( n = 32_a = 23_b \\). The goal is to determine the smallest possible value of \\( a + b \\).\n\n### Step 2: Translate to Base-10\n\n1. **Expression for \\( 32_a \\):**\n   - In base \\( a \\), \\( 32_a \\) is evaluated as:\n     \\[\n     3a + 2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Expression for \\( 23_b \\):**\n   - In base \\( b \\), \\( 23_b \\) is evaluated as:\n     \\[\n     2b + 3\n     \\]\n\nTo satisfy the condition given, we need:\n\\[\n3a + 2 = 2b + 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for a Relationship Between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)\n\nRearranging the equation \\( 3a + 2 = 2b + 3 \\), we get:\n\\[\n3a = 2b + 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2b = 3a - 1\n\\]\n\nThis suggests a harmony between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) through integer divisibility and an expression for possible values. This suggests that \\( b = \\frac{3a - 1}{2} \\) must yield an integer result.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Solutions \n\nLet's see if we can find suitable integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that the smallest \\( a + b \\) is achieved:\n\nSince \\( b \\) must yield an integer, we require \\( 3a - 1 \\) to be even. Therefore, \\( a \\) must be odd.\n\n1. **Start with \\( a = 5 \\):**\n   - Then \\( b = \\frac{3 \\times 5 - 1}{2} = \\frac{15 - 1}{2} = 7 \\)\n   - Check the sum \\( a + b = 5 + 7 = 12 \\).\n\n   - Calculate values for confirmation:\n     \\[\n     32_5 = 3 \\times 5 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     23_7 = 2 \\times 7 + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17\n     \\]\n   - Both equal 17 in base 10, satisfying the given conditions.\n\n### Step 5: Check for Smaller Possibilities\n\nHaving found one valid pair (5, 7), we need to ensure there isn't a smaller sum for the bases \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n   \n- Trying \\( a = 3 \\), \\( a = 7 \\) or higher does not yield a smaller valid solution since they violate either the base constraint or the integer result for \\( b \\).\n\nThus, we've found the smallest possible sum of \\( a + b \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]\n\nIt's always a good practice to reassess and confirm the solutions but given our checks align, I am confident in this being the smallest sum.",

  "ground_truth": "We start by changing the expressions to base 10 in terms of $a$ and $b$. We also know that the two expressions should be equal since they represent the same number. \\begin{align*}\n32_a&=23_b\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3\\cdot a+2\\cdot 1&=2\\cdot b +3\\cdot1\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3a+2&=2b+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3a&=2b+1.\n\\end{align*}For the smallest sum $a+b$, we would want the smallest bases $a$ and $b$. $a$ and $b$ must be greater than 3, so we'll let $a=4$ and that means $12=2b+1$ and $b$ is not an integer. Next we try $a=5$ and that means $15=2b+1$ and $b=7$. That means our sum is $5+7=\\boxed{12}$. We can check that both expressions work: $32_5=3\\cdot5+2=17$ and $23_7=2\\cdot7+3=17$.\nAlso, it makes sense that $a=5$ works while $a=4$ does not since $3a$ must be odd for $b$ to be an integer ($3a-1=2b$ means $3a$ must be even after subtracting 1), and for $3a$ to be odd, $a$ must also be odd.\n\nAlternatively, we can just try different bases. The smallest possible value for $a$ and $b$ is 4. If we let $b=4$, we'd need a smaller base for $a$ (since we have $3\\cdot a\\approx2\\cdot b$), which isn't possible. When we let $a=4$, we get $32_4=14$ and try to find a $b$ such that $23_b=14$. That means $2b+3=14$ and $b$ is not an integer. When we let $a=5$, we get $32_5=17$ and try to find a $b$ such that $23_b=17$. If $2b+3=17$, then $b=7$ and we still get $a+b=\\boxed{12}$."
