    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. \n\n### First Thoughts\n\nWhen I first read this problem, it's asking for the value of \\( f(g(x)) \\). This looks like a composition of functions problem. I've done some of these before, but let\u2019s break down what information we have.\n\n- \\( f(x) = 2x + 1 \\): This is a linear function where the output is twice the input plus one.\n- \\( g(x) = -3 \\): This is a constant function, meaning no matter what \\( x \\) is, the output is always \\(-3\\).\n\nComposition of functions usually means plugging one function into another. I remember that for \\( f(g(x)) \\), we take whatever \\( g(x) \\) outputs and plug it into \\( f \\). Let's explore this further.\n\n### Brainstorming Approach\n\n1. **Substitute \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\):** Since \\( g(x) \\) always outputs \\(-3\\), what happens if I substitute \\(-3\\) into \\( f(x) \\)?\n\n2. **Evaluate \\( f(-3) \\):** I just need to evaluate the function \\( f \\) using the output of \\( g(x) \\).\n\nWait, so in this problem, we'd be substituting directly because \\( g(x) \\) always gives the same result. Sounds simple enough, but let\u2019s make sure I\u2019ve got it right.\n\n### Calculating \\( f(-3) \\)\n\n\\[ \nf(x) = 2x + 1\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( x = -3 \\):\n\n\\[ \nf(-3) = 2(-3) + 1 \n\\]\n\nHmm, let's do the math:\n\n\\[\nf(-3) = -6 + 1 = -5 \n\\]\n\nOkay, so the value of \\( f(g(x)) \\) or \\( f(-3) \\) here is \\(-5\\).\n\n### Reflection on Solution\n\nLet\u2019s check it again. \n\n- **Does our strategy make sense?** Yes, I needed to substitute the value from \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\).\n- **Does our calculation add up appropriately?** I believe so, because multiplying \\(-3\\) by \\(2\\) gives \\(-6\\) and adding \\(1\\) indeed results in \\(-5\\).\n\nThis problem feels similar to others I've done, particularly how we deal with constant outputs in compositions. The solution process seemed straightforward. \n\n### Final Thought\n\nLooks like everything checks out. This was a good refresher on function composition and interpolation of constant functions. The final value of \\( f(g(x)) \\) is indeed \\(-5\\). \n\nIf there were any errors in the assumptions or calculations, they'd likely show up here, but it seems we've accounted for everything correctly.",
