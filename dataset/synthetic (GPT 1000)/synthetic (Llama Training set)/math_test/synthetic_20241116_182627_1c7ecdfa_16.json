    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by really thinking it through. We have a three-digit number \\(\\underline{2d2}\\), and we need to find the digit \\(d\\) such that this number is divisible by 7. Let's approach this problem step by step, making sure to explore a few different strategies and check our work often.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nMy first thought is that divisibility by 7 isn\u2019t one of the more straightforward divisibility rules like for 2 or 5, which means I'll probably need to do some calculations. \n\nThe number is formatted as \\(\\underline{2d2}\\), so it's actually \\(200 + 10d + 2\\). Ah, okay \u2013 it involves manipulating this expression and working with divisibility somehow. Let me jot that down:\n\n- The number as an expression: \\(200 + 10d + 2 = 202 + 10d\\).\n\n### Strategy Exploration\n\n1. **Divisibility by 7 Rule**: I know there's a more complex divisibility rule for 7, but it might be simpler to just test values of \\(d\\) since \\(d\\) is a single digit (0-9).\n  \n2. **Trial and Error with Division**: I could substitute different values of \\(d\\) into the expression \\(202 + 10d\\), and check if each result divides evenly by 7.\n\n3. **Work with Modular Arithmetic**: Another method could involve using modular arithmetic properties to solve for \\(d\\).\n\nI think I'll start with the trial and error method by checking each possibility for \\(d\\).\n\n### Trying the Trial and Error Method\n\nLet's substitute each digit from 0 to 9 for \\(d\\) and check divisibility:\n\n- **\\(d = 0\\):**\n  \\[\n  202 + 10 \\times 0 = 202 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 202 \\div 7 = 28.8571 \\ldots \\quad \\text{(Not divisible)}\n  \\]\n\n- **\\(d = 1\\):**\n  \\[\n  202 + 10 \\times 1 = 212 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 212 \\div 7 = 30.2857 \\ldots \\quad \\text{(Not divisible)}\n  \\]\n\n- **\\(d = 2\\):**\n  \\[\n  202 + 10 \\times 2 = 222 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 222 \\div 7 = 31.7143 \\ldots \\quad \\text{(Not divisible)}\n  \\]\n\n- **\\(d = 3\\):**\n  \\[\n  202 + 10 \\times 3 = 232 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 232 \\div 7 = 33.1429 \\ldots \\quad \\text{(Not divisible)}\n  \\]\n\n- **\\(d = 4\\):**\n  \\[\n  202 + 10 \\times 4 = 242 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 242 \\div 7 = 34.5714 \\ldots \\quad \\text{(Not divisible)}\n  \\]\n\n- **\\(d = 5\\):**\n  \\[\n  202 + 10 \\times 5 = 252 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 252 \\div 7 = 36 \\quad \\text{(Divisible!)}\n  \\]\n\nAha! When \\(d = 5\\), \\(252\\) is divisible by \\(7\\) because the division does not leave a remainder. Quick check: \\(252 \\div 7 = 36\\), no fractional part. That seems right!\n\n### Verification\n\nActually, let me double-check this answer by recalculating:\n\n- Reevaluate \\(252 \\div 7\\):\n  - \\(252 \\div 7 = 36\\). It's indeed an integer, so \\(252\\) is divisible by 7.\n\nThere's a pleasant sense of symmetry here since everything checks out. Feeling confident that this approach was correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter testing multiple values and verifying divisibility, we found \\(d\\) must be 5 for the number \\(\\underline{2d2}\\) to be divisible by 7. The solution is:\n\\[ d = 5 \\]\n\nGreat, that scratches the brain a bit but lands neatly with a logical finish.",

  "ground_truth": "Here we can use the divisibility rule for 7: drop the last digit, subtract twice its value from the number formed from the remaining digits, and check if the result is divisible by 7. (This rule isn't often used since it's not nearly as simple as the other divisibility rules, but it can still be useful!) To see how this works for the number $\\underline{2d2}$, the rule says drop the last digit (2), leaving the number $\\underline{2d}$; subtracting twice the last digit gives $\\underline{2d} - 4$. This needs to be divisible by 7, but the only multiple of 7 between $20-4=16$ and $29-4=25$ is 21, so we must have $d=\\boxed{5}$ since $25 - 4 = 21$."
