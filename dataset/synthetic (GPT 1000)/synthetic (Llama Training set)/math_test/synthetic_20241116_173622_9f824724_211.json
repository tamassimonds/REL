    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem bit by bit. First impressions and thoughts are that we are dealing with permutations of numbers. We are asked to find the 50th permutation of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 when ordered in increasing order. \n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- This reminds me of the classic permutation problems I've seen before, such as reordering digits and figuring out a specific sequence in permutations.\n- I need to figure out how many permutations there are and determine the specific order where the 50th permutation appears.\n  \n### Step 1: Permutations Basics\n- These are permutations of 5 distinct numbers - the sequence will have \\(5!\\) total permutations.\n- Calculating \\(5!\\): \n  \\[\n  5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n  \\]\n- So there are 120 permutations total, and we're interested in the 50th.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Position Range\n- Since we're ordered from least to greatest, the permutations start with the smallest digit and increment through the list.\n- Each digit in the first position would correspond to \\((4!)\\) permutations.\n- Calculation: \\(4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\\) permutations for each starting digit.\n- Let's break it down by leading digits:\n  - Numbers starting with '1': 1-24\n  - Numbers starting with '2': 25-48\n  - Numbers starting with '3': 49-72\n\n### Step 3: Identify Leading Digit\n- The 50th permutation falls into the range of numbers starting with '3' since the range is from 49 to 72.\n\n### Step 4: Determine Subsequent Digits\n- Now, we need to find the exact placement within the group starting with '3'. The second digit decision will again use \\((3!)\\) permutations.\n- Following the digit '3', permutations are cataloged as follows:\n  - Digits starting with '31': 49-54\n  - Digits starting with '32': 55-60\n\n### Step 5: Find Specific Order in '31'\n- The 50th permutation necessarily falls within the '31' group. Working within this smaller group:\n  - We need the \\(2^{\\text{nd}}\\) permutation in the sequence starting with '31'.\n  - Calculations are based on permutations for each subsequent digit. Two permutations switch within '31', since:\n  - '314': (First permutation)\n  - '315': (Second permutation)\n\n### Conclusion & Verification\n- Therefore, the sequence '31452' is the 50th permutation.\n- Just to ensure correctness, let's recount the placement:\n  - Starting with '3', sub-divided as '31'.\n  - With remaining digits, we've confirmed '314' is followed by '315'.\n\n### Check for Sense\n- The logic holds as tracked through step divisions, and calculations align with expectations.\n- Given the extent of permutations possible (120), the indexed placements are verified step-by-step.\n\nThe solution makes sense, and by jogging through each sub-group verification, I feel confident about the accuracy. Thus, the 50th number in our permutation sequence is **'31452'**.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's go through this problem again carefully and find where things went astray. \n\n### Re-Evaluating the Problem:\n\nAt first, my thought process seemed aligned as I calculated the total number of permutations for five digits, acknowledged the grouping by leading digits, and narrowed down the possible candidates. However, my mistake was in the execution of finding the exact permutation within the smaller group starting with '3'.\n\n### Let's Re-brainstorm:\n\n1. **Reconfirm Leading Digit Logic:**\n   - We correctly identified that numbers starting with '1' and '2' occupy positions 1-24 and 25-48, respectively, due to \\(4!\\) permutations.\n   - Therefore, the 50th permutation indeed falls within the range of those starting with '3', which spans 49-72.\n\n2. **Re-evaluating the Group Starting with '3':**\n   \n   Our concern now is to accurately find which permutation within the '3' leading group is the 50th overall. \n\n3. **Locate Exact Placement:**\n   - For permutations starting with '3', the first sub-group '31' spans from 49-54.\n   - This means the 50th permutation is the second one from this sub-group.\n   \n4. **Determine the Exact Sequence:**\n   - Within numbers starting with '31', calculate the next possible order using the remaining digits (2, 4, 5).\n   - Permutation order:\n     - 31245 (49th overall, 1st with '31')\n     - 31254 (50th overall, 2nd with '31')\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter retracing the logic step by step and recalculating the positions within the permutations accurately, it is clear that the 50th permutation from least to greatest of the five-digit integers using 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is indeed **31254**.\n\nThis was a valuable lesson in double-checking calculations and verifying each step of the process to ensure accuracy. Thank you for the opportunity to correct and refine my approach.",

  "ground_truth": "We start with the numbers that start with 1.  There are 4 ways to pick the next digit, then 3 ways to pick the third digit, 2 ways to pick the fourth, and 1 to pick the last.  Therefore, there are $4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=24$ integers with 1 as the first digit.  Similarly, another 24 have 2 as the first digit. That's 48 numbers so far, so we want the second smallest number that starts with 3.  The smallest is 31245, and the next smallest is $\\boxed{31254}$."
