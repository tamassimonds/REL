For this problem, an Ace can either come before a 2 or after a King, but not both (so A23 and QKA both count, but KA2 doesn't).",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We need to find the probability that 3 randomly selected cards from a 52-card deck form a group of three consecutive cards of the same suit. \n\n**First thoughts:**\n\n- This problem mentions arranging cards such that they are consecutive and of the same suit. My first thought is that there must be a finite set of combinations for this within each suit.\n- We need to understand what \"consecutive\" means exactly in the context of a deck where Ace can be before a 2 or after a King but not \"wrapping around.\" So, hands like A-2-3 or Q-K-A are allowed, but not K-A-2.\n\n**Initial approach:**\n\n1. **Define \"group of 3 consecutive cards\":** Let's establish that \"consecutive\" cards mean those like 2-3-4, 10-J-Q, A-2-3 for each suit. We'll have to explore all suits for these patterns.\n\n2. **Count possible combinations within one suit:**\n   - Each suit has cards from Ace through King. Within each suit, what combinations of three consecutive cards are there?\n   - The order would be like: A-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., Q-K-A. Since A-K-Q would not form a consecutive group because no card is wrapping around past King to Ace in this sense (e.g. K-A-2 is invalid, Q-K-A is valid).\n\n3. **Calculate total combinations for one suit:**\n   - For one suit, the possible combinations of three consecutive cards:\n     - Start with Ace: A-2-3\n     - 2-3-4\n     - 3-4-5\n     - \u2026\n     - Q-K-A\n   - Let\u2019s count: Ace goes with 2-3, 2 goes with 3-4, 3 goes with 4-5, \u2026 , Q goes with K and A. There would be 11 such combinations (since starting with '1' ends at 'Q').\n\n4. **Explore total combinations for all suits:**\n   - Total combinations for one suit: 11 (previously established).\n   - Since there are 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades), the combinations across all suits would be 11 * 4 = 44.\n   - The assumption here is that each of the sequence sets in a suit is independent from another suit (since the suit is a defining feature of the sequence).\n\n5. **Total number of ways to select any 3 cards:**\n   - There are a total of \\(\\binom{52}{3}\\) ways to choose any 3 cards from the deck regardless of suit or sequence.\n   - This calculates to: \\(\\binom{52}{3} = 22,100\\). \n\n6. **Calculate the probability:**\n   - The probability would then be the number of favorable outcomes (44) over the total possible outcomes (22,100).\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{44}{22,100}\\).\n\n7. **Final check for reasonableness and calculation accuracy:**\n   - \\(\\frac{44}{22,100}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{2}{1,005}\\), which seems reasonable considering the problem constraints and extends checks back through counting logic without edge cases missed.\n   - It maps with expectations given other probability fractions, being a relatively small chance because of the strict definition of consecutiveness within a suit.\n\nSo, the final probability that 3 randomly selected cards from a standard 52-card deck form a group of three consecutive cards of the same suit is \\(\\frac{2}{1,005}\\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial calculation. Let's re-examine the problem with a fresh perspective and ensure we get it right this time.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Approach:**\n\nInitially, I counted 11 valid sequences of three consecutive cards within each suit, but upon a closer look, it seems there was an oversight. We need to accurately account for each possible consecutive grouping, ensuring we consider all valid starting points within a suit.\n\n**Revisiting Consecutive Cards:**\n\n- In a single suit, the sequence can start at A, 2, 3, ..., all the way up to Q. \n- Each starting point will result in a sequence of three cards: A-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., up to Q-K-A. \n\nUpon reflecting, I see that I miscounted before. There are indeed 12 valid starting positions in each suit for sequences of three consecutive cards, because we can start at Ace and go all the way to Queen.\n\n**Correct Calculation for Total Combinations:**\n\n- Total possible consecutive groupings in one suit: 12 (not 11 as initially thought).\n- Since there are 4 suits, the valid groupings across all suits would be 12 * 4 = 48.\n\n**Probability Recalculation:**\n\n- Total number of ways to select any 3 cards: \\(\\binom{52}{3} = 22,100\\).\n- Therefore, the probability should be recalculated as the number of favorable outcomes (48) over the total possible outcomes (22,100).\n\nThis gives us:\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{48}{22,100} \\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\\[ \\frac{48}{22,100} \\]\n\nUpon simplifying, we find:\n\\[ \\frac{48}{22,100} = \\frac{12}{5,525} \\]\n\nCertainly, upon reviewing the entire process, the probability that 3 randomly selected cards from a standard 52-card deck form a group of three consecutive cards of the same suit is indeed \\(\\frac{12}{5,525}\\).\n\nThrough reflecting on the problem's requirements and carefully recounting the sequences, this solution aligns accurately with the constraints and provides the correct probability.",

  "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{52}{3} = 22,\\!100$ ways to choose 3 cards out of 52, without regard to order. For any suit, there are 12 possible triples of consecutive cards (since the three consecutive cards can start on an A, 2, 3, ..., or Q, but not on a K). Since there are 4 suits, there are $4\\cdot12=48$ valid triples. The chance that three cards chosen randomly are three consecutive cards of the same suit is therefore $\\frac{48}{22,\\!100}=\\boxed{\\frac{12}{5,\\!525}}$"
