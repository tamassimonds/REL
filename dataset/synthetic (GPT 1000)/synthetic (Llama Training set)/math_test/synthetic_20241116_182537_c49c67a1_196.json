    "working_out": "Okay, so let's dive into this problem: \n\nWe're given a function \\( f(x) = 2x + 1 \\) and asked to determine what \\( g(g(2)) \\) is, where \\( g(x) = f(2x) - 3 \\).\n\nFirst thoughts: \n- When I look at this problem, I see that \\( g(x) \\) is defined in terms of \\( f(x) \\), and a transformation is applied. I'm curious about how these transformations interact. It seems like a substitution problem involving nested functions, which can get tricky, but we can tackle it by carefully addressing each function one step at a time. \n\nLet\u2019s brainstorm how we could break this down:\n- We need to evaluate \\( g(g(2)) \\), so clearly, the first step would be to find \\( g(2) \\).\n- Once we have \\( g(2) \\), we'll substitute that result back into the function \\( g(x) \\). It's essential to be precise in these substitutions as errors can easily happen with nested functions.\n\nStep 1: Find \\( g(2) \\):\n\nThe definition of \\( g(x) \\) is:\n\\[ g(x) = f(2x) - 3. \\]\n\n- Plug \\( x = 2 \\) into \\( g(x) \\):\n  \\[\n  g(2) = f(2 \\cdot 2) - 3 = f(4) - 3.\n  \\]\n\nNow let's find \\( f(4) \\):\n- Using the definition of \\( f(x) = 2x + 1 \\), we find:\n  \\[\n  f(4) = 2 \\times 4 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9.\n  \\]\n\nSo, substituting back into \\( g(2) \\):\n\\[\ng(2) = 9 - 3 = 6.\n\\]\n\nHmm, let\u2019s pause for a moment to reflect... Does this make sense? We wanted \\( g(2) \\) and calculated it based on \\( f(4) \\), and our logic seems sound. This seems correct so far. Now that we know \\( g(2) = 6 \\), we can proceed.\n\nStep 2: Find \\( g(g(2)) = g(6) \\):\n\nNext, replace \\( x = 6 \\) back into \\( g(x) \\):\n- Since \\( g(x) = f(2x) - 3 \\), we substitute:\n  \\[\n  g(6) = f(2 \\cdot 6) - 3 = f(12) - 3.\n  \\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( f(12) \\):\n- Using the definition \\( f(x) = 2x + 1 \\):\n  \\[\n  f(12) = 2 \\times 12 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25.\n  \\]\n\nSubstitute back into \\( g(6) \\):\n\\[\ng(6) = 25 - 3 = 22.\n\\]\n\nFinal thoughts:\n- Everything looks consistent with our calculations. We've been careful with each step, following the problem's logic and double-checking whenever necessary.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[ g(g(2)) = 22. \\]\n\nThis reflection helps confirm that no steps were left out or misunderstood in a potentially complex substitution problem. We altered our approach slightly but followed a logical sequence, ensuring the result is correct.",
