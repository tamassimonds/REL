    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. \n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n- We're looking for integer palindromes between 10,000 and 70,000. \n- These numbers must read the same forwards and backwards, and they must be even.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Palindromes are numerically symmetric. For a five-digit number, the first digit must equal the last, and the second must equal the fourth.\n- Since we need even numbers, the last digit (which is the same as the first for a palindrome) must be even.\n\n**Step 2: Breaking Down the Problem**\n\n- The palindromes need to be 5-digit numbers between 10,000 and 70,000.\n- Let's represent a typical 5-digit palindrome as \\(ABCBA\\), where the digits are \\(A, B, C\\).\n\n**Checking Conditions:**\n\n- \\(ABCBA\\) is a palindrome if \\(A\\) equals the last \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) equals the second \\(B\\), which is inherently true for any palindrome.\n- For the number to be even, \\(A\\) must be an even number. So \\(A\\) could be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, but since the number must be between 10,000 and 69,999, \\(A\\) must at least start from 1, then 2, 4, and 6.\n\n**Step 3: Generating Palindromes**\n\n- Since \\(A\\) has specific constraints, we can write candidate ranges for \\(A\\) as 2, 4, and 6 (since \\(A=0\\) would make it a four-digit number).\n  \nWith \\(A\\) defined, let's narrow it down:\n\n1. **Case \\(A = 2\\):** The palindrome could be: \n   - Starts at 20002 up to 29992.\n   - Varying \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) gives: 20002, 20102, ..., 29992.\n\n2. **Case \\(A = 4\\):** The palindrome could be:\n   - Starts at 40004 up to 49994.\n   - Varying \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) gives: 40004, 40104, ..., 49994.\n\n3. **Case \\(A = 6\\):** The palindrome could be:\n   - Starts at 60006 up to 69996.\n   - Varying \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) gives: 60006, 60106, ..., 69996.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Number of Palindromes**\n\n- For each \\(A\\), \\(B\\) varies from 0 to 9 and \\(C\\) varies from 0 to 9 (as they form 3-digit numbers, thus 10 choices for each, combined yields 100 possibilities per starting digit).\n- Therefore, for \\(A = 2\\), \\(A = 4\\), \\(A = 6\\), we have \\(100 + 100 + 100\\) possibilities.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Just to ensure everything is correct, let's confirm our palindrome structure and the strict constraints we've applied.\n- We've considered all valid five-digit even numbers based on \\(A\\), and used cases to simplify possibilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The total number of integer palindromes between 10,000 and 70,000 that are even is \\(100 + 100 + 100 = 300\\).\n\nLet's check everything adds up logically.... Yep, that feels consistent! That covers all possibilities, thinking through the structure of five-digit numbers, and ensures only valid even palindromes are counted. So, our final answer is 300 even palindromes in the given range.",

  "ground_truth": "The first digit can be any one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Whatever the first digit is, that fixes what the units digit can be.  If we are going to have an even integer, the units digit must be even.  This restricts the first digit to 2, 4 or 6.  Then, there are 10 choices for the next (thousands) digit. That fixes what the tens digit can be.  Finally, there are 10 choices for the third (hundreds) digit.  So, we can construct $3\\times10\\times10= \\boxed{300}$ palindromes by choosing the digits."
