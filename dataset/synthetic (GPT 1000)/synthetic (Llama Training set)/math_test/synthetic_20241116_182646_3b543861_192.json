    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle the problem of computing \\(\\cos 120^\\circ\\).\n\n**First Impressions and Ideas:**\n\n1. **Initial Thought:** \n   - This problem reminds me of something! I remember from trigonometry that there's a way to break down angles that aren't standard ones, like 0, 30, 45, 60, or 90 degrees. But 120 degrees... that's past 90 degrees and into the second quadrant.\n   \n2. **What's familiar?**\n   - There's something about the unit circle and how angles correlate with the cosine values based on their position in different quadrants.\n\n3. **Potential Strategy:** \n   - Perhaps breaking 120 degrees into smaller, more manageable angles might help. I could express it as a sum or difference of known angles like 90 and 30 degrees.\n\n4. **Alternative Methods:**\n   - Look up relationships in the unit circle.\n   - Use a cosine subtraction formula if necessary.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1. **Understanding 120 Degrees:**\n   - Since the problem deals with 120 degrees, let's situate it on the unit circle. I know that the angle is measured counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis.\n   - 120 degrees is in the second quadrant because it's more than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.\n\n2. **Finding the Reference Angle:**\n   - In the second quadrant, cosine values are negative, which is important for my answer. \n   - The reference angle for 120 degrees can be found by subtracting it from 180 degrees (as the reference angle is always the smallest angle to the x-axis): \\(180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 60^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Cosine of the Reference Angle:**\n   - I know from standard values (must remember!) that \\(\\cos 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Considering Quadrant Rules:**\n   - As I determined earlier, since 120 degrees is in the second quadrant, \\(\\cos 120^\\circ\\) will be negative.\n\n5. **Calculating \\(\\cos 120^\\circ\\):**\n   - So, the cosine of 120 degrees will be the negative cosine of its reference angle, giving us \\(\\cos 120^\\circ = -\\cos 60^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n**Checking My Work:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) make sense for a second quadrant angle? Yes, since cosine is negative there.\n  \n- **Reflection:** This seems right. The method of using the reference angle aligns with typical practices in solving such problems. The negative sign is consistent with the rules of the unit circle for the second quadrant.\n\n- **Alternative Approach Confirmation:** I could use the cosine of a sum or difference of angles formula, but it might overcomplicate things when a simpler method works.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nTherefore, \\(\\cos 120^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}\\).",
