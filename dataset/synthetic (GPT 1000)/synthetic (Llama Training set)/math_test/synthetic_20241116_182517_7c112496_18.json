    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, keeping an open mind and exploring different strategies. The question is straightforward: we need to find the value of \\( x \\) such that \\( \\sqrt{2x + 1} = 5 \\).\n\n### Initial Exploration\nFirst, let's think about what the equation is asking. We have the expression \\( \\sqrt{2x + 1} \\) which simplifies to 5. This reminds me of problems where we need to deal with square roots by squaring both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\nAlright, let's try that approach:\n\n#### Step 1: Remove the Square Root\nTo eliminate the square root, we need to square both sides of the equation. \n\\[ \\sqrt{2x + 1} = 5 \\]\n\nSquaring both sides gives:\n\\[ (\\sqrt{2x + 1})^2 = 5^2 \\]\n\nSo, simplifying that:\n\\[ 2x + 1 = 25 \\]\n\nThis seems correct so far because squaring both sides removes the square root, leaving us with a linear equation.\n\n#### Step 2: Solve the Linear Equation\nNow, I have a simple linear equation:\n\\[ 2x + 1 = 25 \\]\n\nI will subtract 1 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\).\n\\[ 2x = 25 - 1 \\]\n\\[ 2x = 24 \\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\).\n\\[ x = \\frac{24}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 12 \\]\n\n### Verification\nBefore we wrap this up, let's verify our solution by substituting \\( x = 12 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the given condition.\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 12 \\) into \\( \\sqrt{2x + 1} \\):\n\\[ \\sqrt{2(12) + 1} = \\sqrt{24 + 1} = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\]\n\nThis works out correctly, as 5 equals 5, confirming that the solution is valid.\n\n### Reflection\nLooking back, the strategy of eliminating the square root by squaring both sides was sensible, and it led straight to a simple linear equation. This approach was efficient for this problem.\n\nIf this hadn't worked, I might have considered re-examining my squaring step for errors or re-checking my algebra. There's also a chance that I've been given an extraneous solution if the equation had more complexity, but for this case, things appear straightforward.\n\nIn conclusion, the value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the original equation is \\( x = 12 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Squaring both sides of the equation $\\sqrt{2x + 1} = 5$, we get $2x + 1 = 5^2 = 25$, so $x = (25 - 1)/2 = 24/2 = \\boxed{12}$."
