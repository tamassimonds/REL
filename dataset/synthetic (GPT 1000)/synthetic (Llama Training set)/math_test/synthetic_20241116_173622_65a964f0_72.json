    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We need to find the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) given: \n- The units digit of \\( a \\) is 2.\n- The units digit of \\( b \\) is 4.\n- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is 6.\n\n### Step 1: Understand and Explore the Problem\nAt the outset, let's consider what it means for the GCD of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to be 6. This suggests that both numbers are multiples of 6. Since 6 is the GCD, they likely share no higher common factors.\n\nFor the units digits:\n- If the units digit of \\( a \\) is 2, \\( a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10} \\).\n- If the units digit of \\( b \\) is 4, \\( b \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10} \\).\n\nFrom the reminders \\( a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10} \\) and \\( b \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10} \\), it helps to think about specific numbers modulo 10 that meet these conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Delve into Examples\nGiven these modulo conditions, let's express \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in terms of 10:\n- \\( a = 10m + 2 \\) \n- \\( b = 10n + 4 \\) \n\nNow consider their common factor condition:\n- Since \\( \\text{GCD}(a, b) = 6 \\), both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must be multiples of 6.\n  - Therefore, \\( a = 6k \\) and \\( b = 6l \\) for integers \\( k \\) and \\( l \\).\n\n### Step 3: Substitute and Check\nSubstitute the expression for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n- \\( 6k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10} \\)\n- \\( 6l \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10} \\)\n\nNow we solve these linear congruences:\n- For \\( 6k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10} \\):\n\n  \\[\n  6k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10} \\implies 3k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\n  \\]\n\n  Solving, \\( k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\implies k = 5m + 2 \\).\n\n- For \\( 6l \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10} \\):\n\n  \\[\n  6l \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10} \\implies 3l \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\n  \\]\n\n  Solving, \\( l \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\implies l = 5n + 4 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the LCM\nSubstitute back into variable expressions:\n- Minimum values of \\( k \\) and \\( l \\) are 2 and 4 respectively.\n- Thus:\n  - \\( a = 6(5 \\times 0 + 2) = 12 \\)\n  - \\( b = 6(5 \\times 0 + 4) = 24 \\)\n\nCalculate LCM:\n- \\(\\text{LCM}(12, 24)\\)\n\n  As \\( b = 24 \\) is a multiple of \\( a = 12 \\), the least common multiple is 24.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Solution\nVerify all conditions are met:\n- Units digit: \\( 12 \\rightarrow 2 \\), \\( 24 \\rightarrow 4 \\).\n- GCD condition: GCD(12, 24) = 12, not matching required 6.\n\nLet's backtrack, adjust \\( a, b\\) so it adheres to GCD of 6.\nAdjustments:\n- Select distinct: \\( a = 12 \\) and \\( b = 18\\).\n  - New LCM: \\(\\text{LCM}(12, 18) = 36\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter refining, the smallest values conforming all conditions:\n- Smallest possible LCM of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is \\( \\boxed{36} \\).\n- This matches conditions: correct unit digits and correct GCD. Valid approach indeed.\n\nRevising these possibilities and applying modular constraints with insight, gives coherent results!\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's reassess the problem with a fresh perspective and incorporate the correct approach. \n\n### Revisiting the Problem\n\nWe have two positive integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) with the following conditions:\n- The units digit of \\( a \\) is 2.\n- The units digit of \\( b \\) is 4.\n- The greatest common divisor \\(\\text{GCD}(a, b) = 6\\).\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest possible value of the least common multiple \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b)\\).\n\n### Initial Brainstorm\n\nLet's start by analyzing the constraints:\n1. Since \\(\\text{GCD}(a, b) = 6\\), both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must be multiples of 6. However, they should not have a common multiple greater than 6.\n\n2. The units digit condition compels:\n   - \\( a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10} \\)\n   - \\( b \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10} \\)\n\nThese constraints guide us to specific integers that satisfy both.\n\n### Exploring Different Strategies\n\n1. **Using Modulo and Multiple Analysis:**\n\n   - **Options for \\( a \\):** Since \\( a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10} \\) and is a multiple of 6, let's list the possibilities: \n     - \\( a = 12, 42, 72, 102, \\ldots \\)\n\n   - **Options for \\( b \\):** Since \\( b \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10} \\) and is a multiple of 6, let's list the possibilities:\n     - \\( b = 24, 54, 84, 114, \\ldots \\)\n\n2. **Checking the GCD and LCM:**\n\n   - We know from the identity \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b) \\cdot \\text{GCD}(a, b) = a \\cdot b\\), so we want to minimize \\(a \\cdot b \\) such that the GCD is 6.\n\n   - **Attempting pair combinations:**\n\n     - Consider \\( a = 12 \\) and \\( b = 24 \\):\n       - \\(\\text{GCD}(12, 24) = 12\\) (too high, needs to be reduced to 6).\n\n     - Consider \\( a = 12 \\) and \\( b = 54 \\):\n       - Calculate: \\(\\text{GCD}(12, 54) = 6\\) (correct).\n       - \\(\\text{LCM}(12, 54) = \\frac{12 \\times 54}{6} = 108.\\)\n\n     - Consider \\( a = 42 \\) and \\( b = 24 \\):\n       - Calculate: \\(\\text{GCD}(42, 24) = 6\\).\n       - \\(\\text{LCM}(42, 24) = \\frac{42 \\times 24}{6} = 168.\\)\n\nOf these options, \\( \\text{LCM}(12, 54) = 108\\) is indeed the smallest, aligning with our conditions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, upon careful reconsideration and verification of pairs, the smallest possible value for \\(\\text{LCM}(a, b)\\) that meets all the constraints is \\(\\boxed{108}\\).

  "ground_truth": "Both $a$ and $b$ must be divisible by $6$, so the choices for $a$ are $$12, 42, 72, 102, 132, \\ldots\\phantom{~.}$$and the choices for $b$ are $$24, 54, 84, 114, 144, \\ldots~.$$We know that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot \\gcd(a,b)=ab$ (since this identity holds for all positive integers $a$ and $b$). Therefore, $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = \\frac{ab}{6},$$so in order to minimize $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$, we should make $ab$ as small as possible. But we can't take $a=12$ and $b=24$, because then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be $12$, not $6$. The next best choice is either $a=12,b=54$ or $a=42,b=24$. Either of these pairs yields $\\gcd(a,b)=6$ as desired, but the first choice, $a=12$ and $b=54$, yields a smaller product. Hence this is the optimal choice, and the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[12,54] = \\frac{12\\cdot 54}{6} = 2\\cdot 54 = \\boxed{108}.$$"
