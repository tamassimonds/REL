    "working_out": "Alright, let's approach this problem step-by-step. We're asked to find the maximum value of the expression \\( 4(x + 7)(2 - x) \\) over all real numbers \\( x \\). \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Initial Reaction:**\n   - This looks like a quadratic expression when expanded. It reminds me of problems involving finding maximum or minimum values of quadratic functions. I'm thinking about completing the square or using the vertex formula for a quadratic. \n\n2. **Expanding the Expression:**\n   - Let's start by expanding the expression to see its quadratic form. We have:\n     \\[\n     4(x + 7)(2 - x) = 4[(x + 7)(2 - x)]\n     \\]\n   - Expanding the parenthesis, we get:\n     \\[\n     (x + 7)(2 - x) = x \\cdot 2 + 7 \\cdot 2 - x \\cdot x - 7 \\cdot x = 2x + 14 - x^2 - 7x\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying this, we have:\n     \\[\n     -x^2 + 2x + 14 - 7x = -x^2 - 5x + 14\n     \\]\n   - Now multiply by 4:\n     \\[\n     4(-x^2 - 5x + 14) = -4x^2 - 20x + 56\n     \\]\n\n3. **Thinking about Maximization:**\n   - The expression \\( -4x^2 - 20x + 56 \\) is a quadratic in the standard form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) where \\( a = -4 \\), \\( b = -20 \\), and \\( c = 56 \\).\n   - Because the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) (\\( a = -4 \\)) is negative, the parabola opens downward, so it has a maximum point (the vertex).\n   - To find the maximum, we need the vertex of the parabola.\n\n4. **Finding the Vertex:**\n   - The x-coordinate of the vertex for a quadratic \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is given by \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n     \\[\n     x = -\\frac{-20}{2 \\times -4} = \\frac{20}{8} = \\frac{5}{2}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculating the Maximum Value:**\n   - Substitute \\( x = \\frac{5}{2} \\) into the expression to find the maximum value:\n     \\[\n     -4\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 - 20\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) + 56\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     \\[\n     -4\\left(\\frac{25}{4}\\right) = -25\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -20\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) = -50\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     56\n     \\]\n   - Add them up:\n     \\[\n     -25 - 50 + 56 = -75 + 56 = -19\n     \\]\n\n6. **Double-check:**\n   - Let me review the steps briefly:\n   - The expression was correctly expanded to the quadratic form.\n   - I calculated the vertex using the standard formula for the vertex of a parabola.\n   - The calculations for the maximum value were done carefully.\n   - This means the maximum value of the expression over all real numbers \\( x \\) is \\(-19\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe maximum value of \\( 4(x + 7)(2 - x) \\) for real \\( x \\) is \\(-19\\). This result was achieved by expressing the problem as a quadratic, finding its vertex, and evaluating the maximum value at this point.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculations. Let's re-evaluate the problem and explore other strategies to ensure correctness.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem:**\n\nGiven the expression \\( 4(x + 7)(2 - x) \\), it's clear that this forms a quadratic function when expanded. We already expanded it to \\( -4x^2 - 20x + 56 \\).\n\n**Strategy Reflection:**\n\n1. **Vertex Formula Confirmation:** \n   - I initially used the vertex formula \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\) and calculated the x-coordinate of the vertex as \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\). However, this might not be correct based on the sign of the coefficient and placement of critical points. \n\n2. **Reconsider Symmetry and Vertex Location:**\n   - Let's utilize another powerful property of a parabola: symmetry. The quadratic \\( 4(x + 7)(2 - x) \\) has roots at \\( x = -7 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n   - The vertex, being symmetrically located between the roots, should have its x-coordinate as \\( h = \\frac{-7 + 2}{2} = -\\frac{5}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Re-evaluate Maximum Value at Vertex:**\n   - Substituting \\( x = -\\frac{5}{2} \\) back into the expression to determine the maximum value:\n   \\[\n   4\\left(-\\frac{5}{2} + 7\\right)\\left(2 + \\frac{5}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n   - First, let's evaluate inside the parentheses:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{5}{2} + 7 = \\frac{9}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2 + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{9}{2}\n   \\]\n   - Therefore, the expression becomes:\n   \\[\n   4 \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{81}{4} = 81\n   \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe maximum value of \\( 4(x + 7)(2 - x) \\) occurs at \\( x = -\\frac{5}{2} \\) and is \\( 81 \\). This makes sense because the quadratic opens downwards (as indicated by the negative coefficient of \\( x^2 \\)), confirming that \\( 81 \\) is indeed a maximum value. The considerations of both algebraic manipulation and geometrical properties of parabolas helped affirm this solution.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculations. Let me re-evaluate the problem and explore other strategies to ensure correctness.\n\n### Revisiting the Problem:\n\nGiven the expression \\( 4(x + 7)(2 - x) \\), we know this forms a quadratic function when expanded. Previously, I expanded it to \\( -4x^2 - 20x + 56 \\). Let's explore other strategies to find the maximum value.\n\n### Exploring Different Strategies:\n\n**1. Graphical Insight and Symmetry:**\n\n- The expression \\( 4(x + 7)(2 - x) \\) is a quadratic in disguise. The roots of this expression are \\( x = -7 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\). Since the parabola is symmetric, the vertex lies exactly midway between these roots.\n- The midpoint, or axis of symmetry, is given by:\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{-7 + 2}{2} = -\\frac{5}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**2. Evaluating at the Vertex:**\n\n- Now, let's substitute \\( x = -\\frac{5}{2} \\) into the expression to find the maximum value:\n  \\[\n  4\\left(-\\frac{5}{2} + 7\\right)\\left(2 + \\frac{5}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n- Evaluate inside the parentheses:\n  \\[\n  -\\frac{5}{2} + 7 = \\frac{9}{2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  2 + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{9}{2}\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n  \\[\n  4 \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{81}{4} = 81\n  \\]\n\n**3. Verification and Reflection:**\n\n- The quadratic, by its nature of having a negative coefficient for \\( x^2 \\) (i.e., the term \\(-4x^2\\)), confirms that the parabola opens downwards, which indicates a maximum point at the vertex.\n- The calculated maximum value of 81 aligns with our expectation for the function's behavior, considering the downward opening parabola configuration.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter revisiting the process and considering the symmetry of the quadratic expression, the vertex method confirms that the maximum value of \\( 4(x + 7)(2 - x) \\) is indeed \\( \\boxed{81} \\). This solution leverages both algebraic manipulation and the geometric properties of parabolas to reaffirm the correct result.",

    "error_description": "The model's solution incorrectly calculated the maximum value of the expression \\( 4(x + 7)(2 - x) \\). The final answer given was \\(-19\\), which is incorrect.

The model also made an error in the calculation of the vertex and did not correctly evaluate the expression at the vertex to find the maximum value.",

  "ground_truth": "The graph of $y = 4(x + 7)(2 - x)$ is a parabola.  Since $y = 0$ when $x = -7$ and $x = 2$, the $x$-intercepts of the parabola are $(-7,0)$ and $(2,0)$.  If the vertex of the parabola is $(h,k)$, then the $x$-intercepts $(-7,0)$ and $(2,0)$ are symmetric around the line $x = h$, so $h = (-7 + 2)/2 = -5/2$.\n\nHence, the maximum value of $y = 4(x + 7)(2 - x)$ occurs at $x = -5/2$, in which case \\[y = 4 \\left( -\\frac{5}{2} + 7 \\right) \\left( 2 + \\frac{5}{2} \\right) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = \\boxed{81}.\\] (Note that this is a maximum value, and not a minimum value, because the coefficient of $x^2$ in $y = 4(x + 7)(2 - x) = -4x^2 - 20x + 56$ is negative.)"
