    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive right into this problem. We'll take it step by step, exploring different strategies and correcting any mistakes along the way. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\nThis problem involves the rational function \\( y = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \\), where both \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) are quadratic polynomials. Given are the asymptotes: the horizontal asymptote at \\( y = -1 \\) and a vertical asymptote at \\( x = 2 \\). We need to find \\( \\frac{p(-1)}{q(-1)} \\). \n\nThis reminds me of how rational functions work, with vertical asymptotes indicating zeroes of the denominator and horizontal asymptotes providing information about the degrees and coefficients of the polynomials.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n1. **Horizontal Asymptote Insight:**\n   - The horizontal asymptote \\( y = -1 \\) tells us that the degrees of \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) are the same and the leading coefficient of \\( p(x) \\) is -1 times the leading coefficient of \\( q(x) \\).\n   - For horizontal asymptote \\( y = -1 \\), it means as \\( x \\to \\infty \\), \\(\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \\to -1\\), suggesting the leading term of \\( p(x) \\) is \\(-1 \\times\\) the leading term of \\( q(x) \\).\n\n2. **Vertical Asymptote Insight:**\n   - The vertical asymptote at \\( x = 2 \\) indicates that \\( q(x) \\) has a factor of \\((x - 2)\\).\n\n3. **Analyzing Degree and Terms:**\n   - Both \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) are quadratic implies that \\(\\deg(p(x)) = \\deg(q(x)) = 2\\).\n   - The simplest setup to meet both the vertical and horizontal asymptote conditions is:\n     \\[\n     p(x) = -a(x - 2)^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q(x) = a(x - 2)^2 \\cdot r(x)\n     \\]\n\nHmm, that feels off. Let\u2019s revise that. Since the function has a horizontal asymptote at \\(-1\\), comparing the leading coefficients directly might be better.\n\n**Let's Construct:**\nFrom the vertical asymptote at \\( x=2 \\), \\( q(x) = a(x-2)^2 \\).\n\n**Factor Form Adjustment:** \nThe vertical asymptote indicates \\( q(x) = a(x-2)^2\\).\nThe denominator should not simplify completely, so let's modify:\n- \\( p(x) = -b(x+5)(x-4) \\) and \n- \\( q(x) = b(x-2)^2 \\).\n\nThis gives the function:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-b(x+5)(x-4)}{b(x-2)^2}\n\\]\nWhere the leading coefficients cancel to provide the horizontal asymptote of \\(-1\\).\n\n**Calculating \\(\\frac{p(-1)}{q(-1)}\\):**\nNow substitute \\( x = -1 \\):\n- \\( p(x) = -b(-1+5)(-1-4) = -b(4)(-5) = 20b \\)\n- \\( q(x) = b((-1)-2)^2 = b(3)^2 = 9b \\)\n\nThus,\n\\[\n\\frac{p(-1)}{q(-1)} = \\frac{20b}{9b} = \\frac{20}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe reasoning and calculations fit the conditions of the problem. I realized partway through I needed the exact leading coefficients and structure that ensures both polynomial degrees and leading coefficient relationships are respected.\n\nThis provides a consistent narrative and confirms the solution \\(\\frac{20}{9}\\).\n\nLet's verify:\nWe accounted for:\n- Horizontal asymptote: degrees and leading coefficients in balance.\n- Vertical asymptote by zeroing the denominator appropriately.\nThus, the solution seems mathematically and logically sound.",

  "ground_truth": "Since there is only one vertical asymptote at $x = 2,$ we can assume that $q(x) = (x - 2)^2.$\n\nSince the graph passes through $(4,0)$ and $(-5,0),$ $p(x) = k(x - 4)(x + 5)$ for some constant $k,$ so\n\\[\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \\frac{k(x - 4)(x + 5)}{(x - 2)^2}.\\]Since the horizontal asymptote is $y = -1,$ $k = -1,$ so\n\\[\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = -\\frac{(x - 4)(x + 5)}{(x - 2)^2}.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{p(-1)}{q(-1)} = -\\frac{(-5)(4)}{(-3)^2} = \\boxed{\\frac{20}{9}}.\\]"
