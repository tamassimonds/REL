I see that we have two conditions: the sum equals 12, and the product is 35. This could be a problem that we can solve using algebraic equations. Though it looks simple, I'm going to have a variety of approaches in mind as sometimes what seems simple might have hidden complexities.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n1. **Method of Substitution or Elimination**: I could use systems of equations here. However, these usually require us to express one variable in terms of another. But since the desired result isn't straightforwardly one of the variables but rather the difference between the numbers, I'll need to remember this when solving.\n\n2. **Factorization Approach**: This involves using the product of numbers to help break down possible pairs that multiply to 35 and then checking if they add up to 12. \n\n3. **Quadratic Equation**: Given the nature of the problem, I suspect it might form a quadratic equation. At this stage, I know that problems like these sometimes translate into quadratic forms \u2014 which often holds the key in these questions.\n\n### Tackling it with a Method\nLet's start with the quadratic approach since it seems the most directly related to finding specific number pairs that satisfy both conditions.\n\n- **Step 1**: Define the Variables  \n  Let the two numbers be \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n  - We know: \n    \\( x + y = 12 \\) \n    \\( xy = 35 \\)\n\n- **Step 2**: Form a Quadratic Equation  \n  I remember from past problems that I can use sum and product conditions to construct a quadratic equation:\n  \\[\n  t^2 - (x+y)t + xy = 0\n  \\]\n  Substituting the given conditions into this, we get:\n  \\[\n  t^2 - 12t + 35 = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **Step 3**: Solve the Quadratic\n  I can find the roots of this quadratic equation using factoring, the quadratic formula, or by recognition if it\u2019s simple enough.\n\n  **Factor it**:  \n  I need two numbers that multiply to 35 and add to 12 \u2014 this feels like a pattern I've seen:\n  \\[\n  t^2 - 12t + 35 = (t - 5)(t - 7) = 0\n  \\]\n  So, the solutions to this are \\( t = 5 \\) and \\( t = 7 \\).\n\n- **Step 4**: Reflect on This Step  \n  I should take a moment to go over if everything makes sense. These numbers, 5 and 7, indeed multiply to 35 and add to 12. Okay, this feels right.\n\n### Calculate the Positive Difference\n- **Step 5**: Calculate Difference  \n  Since the problem asks for the positive difference between these numbers:\n  \\[\n  |5 - 7| = 2\n  \\]\n\n### Final Check\nThe difference, 2, is small enough that a sanity check is easily done. Yes, it's correct since both number requirements are satisfied. This also fits intuitively as the numbers weren't particularly extreme.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe positive difference between the two numbers is 2. The approach seemed satisfactory as it was straightforward and adhered to algebraic principles with no overlooked factors.\n\nThis was an enlightening problem \u2014 helping reinforce the method of translating conditions into a quadratic equation. Always a solid method for two-variable problems defined by sum and product!",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ and $y$ be the two numbers.  We are given  \\begin{align*}\nx+y&=12\\text{, and} \\\\\nxy&=35.\n\\end{align*} Solving the first equation for $y$ and substituting into the second equation, we find $x(12-x)=35$.  Subtracting the left-hand side from both sides of the equation and distributing, we find $0=x^2-12x+35$.  We can factor the right-hand side as $(x-7)(x-5)$, so the solutions are $x=7$ and $x=5$.  Substituting either of these back into $y=12-x$, we find that the two numbers are $7$ and $5$, and their difference is $\\boxed{2}$."
