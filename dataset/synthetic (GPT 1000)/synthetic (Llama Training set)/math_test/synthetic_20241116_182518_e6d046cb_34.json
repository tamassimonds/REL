    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem of arranging the letters of the word \"SIXTEEN\" such that the two E's are not adjacent. \n\n**First Impressions:**\nHmm, at first glance, I recall this problem is about calculating probabilities when certain conditions are placed on arrangements, specifically permutations. This reminds me of permutations with restrictions, which I've encountered before in problems related to arranging letters or objects.\n\n**Step 1: Total Arrangements Without Restrictions**\nFirst, I need to find the total number of ways to arrange the letters in \"SIXTEEN\". The word has 7 letters where 'E' repeats twice. The formula I remember for permutations with duplicates is:\n\\[ \\text{Total permutations} = \\frac{n!}{p!} \\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items to arrange, and \\( p \\) is the number of indistinguishable items. Here, \\( n = 7 \\) and \\( p = 2 \\), so:\n\\[ \\frac{7!}{2!} = \\frac{5040}{2} = 2520 \\]\nSo there are 2520 total arrangements of the letters in \"SIXTEEN\". Sounds correct so far.\n\n**Step 2: Arrangements Where the Two E's Are Together**\nNow, I need to determine the arrangements where the two E's are together as a block or unit. This transforms the problem into arranging the block \"EE\" along with the other distinct letters: S, I, X, T, N. Now, I have 6 entities to arrange.\nThinking out loud, this feels like a simpler arrangement problem: 6 distinct units to arrange, which should be simple.\n\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\text{Total arrangements with \"EE\" together} = 6! = 720 \\]\nThat seems right. It makes intuitive sense since \"EE\" becomes just one unit/letter block of the 6 total.\n\n**Step 3: Probability Calculation**\nAlright, now for the probability where the E's are not next to each other. We wanted the cases where they are not together, so we can use:\n\\[ \\text{Total without EE together} = \\text{Total} - \\text{Total with \"EE\" together} \\]\nSubstitute the known values:\n\\[ 2520 - 720 = 1800 \\]\n\nFinally, the probability:\n\\[ \\text{Probability that two E's are not together} = \\frac{\\text{Total without EE together}}{\\text{Total permutations}} = \\frac{1800}{2520} \\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\nHmm, let me quickly calculate:\n\\[ \\frac{1800}{2520} \\approx \\frac{5}{7} \\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThat looks right, considering the prime factors: \\( 1800 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\) and \\( 2520 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\). The Factor 2, 3, and 5 cancel out.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSo, the probability that the two E's in \"SIXTEEN\" are not next to each other is \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\). Feels like everything checks out. It aligns with what I know about probability and permutation problems, and I've cross-checked with calculations. I feel confident this is correct.",

  "ground_truth": "The best way to do this is to find the probability that the two E's are next to each other.  There are $\\dfrac{7!}{2}$ arrangements of the word SIXTEEN.  If we want to find the number of arrangements such that the E's are next to each other, we find the number of arrangements of the six-letter word SIXT(EE)N (where we treat the two E's as a block), which is $6!$.  So the probability that an arrangement of the word SIXTEEN has the two E's next to each other is $\\dfrac{6!}{\\frac{7!}{2}} = \\dfrac{2}{7}$.  So the probability that the two E's aren't next to each other is $1 - \\dfrac{2}{7} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{7}}$."
