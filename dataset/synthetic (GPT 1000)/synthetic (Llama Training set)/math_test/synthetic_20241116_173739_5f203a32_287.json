    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, allowing room for reflection and strategy shifts where needed.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst, I need to fully grasp what the problem is asking. We have a fraction equivalent to \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) and the sum of its numerator and denominator is \\(91\\). I\u2019m tasked with finding the difference between the numerator and the denominator.\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorming Approaches\n- **Approach 1:** I can represent the fraction as \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), where \\(a\\) is the numerator and \\(b\\) is the denominator.\n- **Approach 2:** Use the property that the fraction simplifies to \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\), and the sum of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\(91\\).\n\n### Step 3: Setting Up Equations\nFirst instinct is often to translate the problem into mathematical equations:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{5}{8}\\)\n2. \\(a + b = 91\\)\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Equations\nLet\u2019s tackle these step-by-step.\n\nFrom \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{5}{8}\\), we can cross multiply to get:\n\\[ 8a = 5b \\qquad \\text{(Let\u2019s call this Equation 1)} \\]\n\nNow using the sum equation:\n\\[ a + b = 91 \\qquad \\text{(Equation 2)} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Express One Variable in Terms of Another\nFrom Equation 1:\n\\[ 8a = 5b \\Rightarrow b = \\frac{8a}{5} \\]\n\nHmm, before substituting it directly into the sum equation, let\u2019s make sure this substitution makes sense and is manageable.\n\n### Step 6: Substituting to Find One Variable\nSubstitute \\(b = \\frac{8a}{5}\\) into Equation 2:\n\\[ a + \\frac{8a}{5} = 91 \\]\n\nMultiply the entire equation by 5 to eliminate the fraction:\n\\[ 5a + 8a = 455 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ 13a = 455 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 13:\n\\[ a = \\frac{455}{13} \\]\n\nLet me check this calculation quickly. 455 divided by 13 should be straightforward:\n- 13 into 45 goes 3 times (since \\(13 \\times 3 = 39\\)), remaining is 6.\n- Bring down 5 to get 65.\n- 13 into 65 goes 5 times precisely (since \\(13 \\times 5 = 65\\)).\n\nSo indeed, \\(a = 35\\). \n\n### Step 7: Find \\(b\\)\nSubstituting \\(a = 35\\) back into \\(a + b = 91\\):\n\\[ 35 + b = 91 \\]\n\\[ b = 91 - 35 = 56 \\]\n\n### Step 8: Difference Calculation\nNow, we know \\(a = 35\\) and \\(b = 56\\).\nDifference = \\(b - a = 56 - 35\\)\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[ 56 - 35 = 21 \\]\n\n### Step 9: Verifying Correctness\nCheck if \\(\\frac{35}{56}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\):\n- Simplifying \\(\\frac{35}{56}\\) by dividing numerator and denominator by 7:\n  \\[ \\frac{35 \\div 7}{56 \\div 7} = \\frac{5}{8} \\]\n\nThis confirms that our solutions are consistent with the problem statement.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe difference between the denominator and numerator of the fraction is \\(21\\). This seems correct based on our logical progression and checks against the initial problem requirements.",

  "ground_truth": "We obtain fractions equivalent to $\\frac{5}{8}$ by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number.\n\nThe sum of the numerator and denominator of $\\frac{5}{8}$ is $13,$ so when we multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number, the sum of the numerator and denominator is also multiplied by this same number.\n\nSince $91 = 13 \\times 7,$ then we should multiply the numerator and denominator both by $7$ to get a fraction $$\\frac{5\\times 7}{8 \\times 7} = \\frac{35}{56}$$equivalent to $\\frac{5}{8}$ whose numerator and denominator add up to $91.$\n\nThe difference between the denominator and numerator in this fraction is $56-35=\\boxed{21}.$"
