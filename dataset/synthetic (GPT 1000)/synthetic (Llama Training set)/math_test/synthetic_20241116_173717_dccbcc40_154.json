    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst, we want to find how many two-digit positive integers have digits that sum to 7. A two-digit integer $\\overline{ab}$ can be broken down into digits $a$ and $b$, where $a$ is the tens digit and $b$ is the units digit. For two-digit numbers, $a$ ranges from 1 to 9, while $b$ ranges from 0 to 9. \n\nThe condition given is that the sum of these digits is 7, i.e., $a + b = 7$. \n\n### Step 2: Exploring a Strategy\nInitially, I think a straightforward approach would be to manually check the digits $a$ and $b$ to see which combinations satisfy the equation $a + b = 7$. \n\n### Step 3: Manual Calculation\nLet's try enumerating values:\n\n- If $a = 1$, then $b = 7 - 1 = 6$. This gives us the number 16.\n- If $a = 2$, then $b = 7 - 2 = 5$. This gives us the number 25.\n- If $a = 3$, then $b = 7 - 3 = 4$. This gives us the number 34.\n- If $a = 4$, then $b = 7 - 4 = 3$. This gives us the number 43.\n- If $a = 5$, then $b = 7 - 5 = 2$. This gives us the number 52.\n- If $a = 6$, then $b = 7 - 6 = 1$. This gives us the number 61.\n- If $a = 7$, then $b = 7 - 7 = 0$. This gives us the number 70.\n- For $a = 8$ or $a = 9$, $b$ would be negative, which is not possible since digits have to be non-negative. So we can disregard these options.\n\n### Step 4: Double-checking the Work\nI'm going to quickly check if I considered all valid values of $a$. For this problem, $a$ can only be as high as 7 for $b$ to remain non-negative. Checking the arithmetic confirms that all possibilities have been accounted for: \n- I found 16, 25, 34, 43, 52, 61, and 70, all of which are valid two-digit numbers.\n\n### Step 5: Final Thoughts\nLet\u2019s count the numbers identified: 16, 25, 34, 43, 52, 61, 70. That gives us 7 valid two-digit integers.\n\nThus, the number of two-digit positive integers whose digits sum to 7 is **7**.\n\nThis approach seems consistent, and the calculation follows the checks and understanding correctly. No edge cases were missed (e.g., $b$ needing to be a non-negative digit), so I'm confident in this solution.",
