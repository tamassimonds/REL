    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step and think through it like we might in a real brainstorming session.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst impression: We're given a least common multiple (LCM) and a greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, and one of the numbers itself. We need to find the other number. This feels familiar, like problems I've encountered involving relationships between LCM and GCD.\n\n**Known**:\n- LCM of two integers = 240\n- GCD of two integers = 24\n- One of the integers is 48\n\n### Key Concept\n\nThis reminds me that for two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the relationship between LCM and GCD is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a, b) \\times \\text{GCD}(a, b) = a \\times b\n\\]\n\n### Setting Up the Equation\n\nGiven:\n- LCM = 240\n- GCD = 24\n- \\( a = 48 \\)\n\nWe need to find the other integer \\( b \\).\n\nFrom the formula above, plugging in the values, we have:\n\n\\[\n240 \\times 24 = 48 \\times b\n\\]\n\n### Solving for \\( b \\)\n\nSolving the above equation for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{240 \\times 24}{48}\n\\]\n\nAlright, let's calculate this step by step:\n\n1. Calculate \\( 240 \\times 24 \\).\n\n    \\[\n    240 \\times 24 = 5760\n    \\]\n\n2. Divide this by 48.\n\n    \\[\n    b = \\frac{5760}{48}\n    \\]\n\n3. Now, perform the division:\n\n    \\[\n    b = 120\n    \\]\n\n### Reflection and Verification\n\nHmm, let's step back and ensure everything makes sense:\n\n- We used the relationship correctly: **LCM \\(\\times\\) GCD = \\(a \\times b\\)**.\n- The calculation for \\( b \\) seems logical and my arithmetic checks out.\n- Once we calculated, quick double-check: If \\( b = 120 \\), check if it fulfills LCM and GCD conditions.\n\n**Check GCD(48, 120)**:\n- Factors of 48: \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48\\)\n- Factors of 120: \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120\\)\n- Common factors: \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\\)\n- Highest common factor: \\(24\\) Yes, that's correct.\n\n**Check LCM(48, 120)**:\n- (Quick estimation approach): \n  - Highest power of common primes: LCM should be constructed taking the highest power of primes in both numbers.\n  - Breakdown:\n    - 48: \\(2^4 \\times 3^1\\)\n    - 120: \\(2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\)\n  - LCM \\(= 2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 240\\)\n- Oh, seems good. Matches the problem requirement.\n\nThis ultimately looks correct.\n\n### Final Verification and Conclusion\n\nOur solution is consistent with both the LCM and GCD given in the problem statement. Thus, the other integer is **120**. \n\nProblem-breaking like this often shows insights and helps reconfirm the solution path. Normally, this intuitive checking would be more blurred, but writing them down ensures we're sound. No need for further adjustments; on this one, everything checks out.",

  "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of 48 is $2^4\\cdot3$. Since the greatest common factor is 24, that means the other number also has the factors $2^3$ and 3 but not a fourth 2. When we divide 240 by 48, we get 5. The factors $2^3$ and 3 of the other number are covered by the factors of 48, but the factor 5 must come from the other number. So, the other number is $2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5=\\boxed{120}$."
