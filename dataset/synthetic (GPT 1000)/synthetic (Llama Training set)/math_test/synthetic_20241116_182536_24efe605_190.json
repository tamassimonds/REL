    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We need to find the probability of flipping at least three heads in a row when flipping a fair coin four times. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll tackle it:\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- My first instinct is to list all the possible outcomes when flipping a coin four times. Then, identify which sequences have at least three heads in a row.\n- Another thought is to use a probability formula or model, like conditional probability, but listing seems more straightforward for now.\n- Hmm, this feels like a problem I may have encountered before in different contexts, involving consecutive events and probability.\n\n### Step-by-step Approach:\n\n**Step 1:** Identify total outcomes.\n- When flipping a coin four times, each flip has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails).\n- This gives us a total of \\(2^4 = 16\\) possible sequences of heads and tails.\n\n**Step 2:** Enumerate cases with at least three heads in a row.\n- Let\u2019s enumerate possible sequences of flipping four times:  \n\n  - HHHH  \n  - HHHT  \n  - THHH  \n  - TTHH  \n  - HTTH  \n  - HTHT  \n  - THHT  \n  - TTTT  \n  - ... (need to go through and find the relevant ones).\n\n- From these, we're interested in those with at least 3 consecutive heads:  \n  - HHHH (all heads)\n  - HHHT\n  - THHH\n\n  Check: there might be more sequences with at least three consecutive heads, but these seem right. Let me think a little more if there could be others...\n  - Hmm, nope, that's it - the other patterns break the streak of three.\n\n**Step 3:** Count favorable outcomes.\n- Indeedy, we found three sequences that satisfy the condition (HHHH, HHHT, THHH).\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate probabilities.\n- We have 3 favorable outcomes.\n- Out of the total 16 possible outcomes, the probability is \\( \\frac{3}{16} \\).\n\n**Realization and Check:**\n- Wait, let's double-check these outcomes... I feel confident those are the right sequences.\n- Actually, yes, the calculations and logic check out: 3 favorable out of 16 possibilities.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n- The probability of flipping at least three heads in a row in four coin flips is \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\).\n\nThis looks like a neat fit to the problem requirements. I would double-check my list of at least three consecutive heads any day, but I feel confident about this process and result.",

  "ground_truth": "The quickest way to solve this problem is to count the number of outomes that have three heads in a row, as we already know very clearly that there are $2^4$ outcomes total. So, HHHH, HHHT, THHH are the only 3 outcomes that have three consecutive heads. So, our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}$."
