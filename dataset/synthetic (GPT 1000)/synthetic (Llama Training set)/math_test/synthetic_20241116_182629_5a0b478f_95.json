    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this cube problem and think it through step by step.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- A cube is a three-dimensional shape with equal side lengths on all its edges. If we know three vertices, we should be able to deduce the side length.\n- The vertices of a cube have coordinate differences that reflect moves by the side length along the axes.\n- Three vertices of the cube are given, which suggests these points might form a triangle on the surface or diagonals of the cube.\n\n**Strategy Brainstorm:**\n\n1. Find the distances between each pair of the given points. \n    - These distances should give us a clue about relationships between the points (like whether they form an edge, face diagonal, or space diagonal of the cube).\n\n2. Verify potential positions of other vertices based on logical extensions of known vertices and confirming equal distances.\n\n3. Consider if these points could give information about the diagonal, with the longest distance potentially being the space diagonal.\n\n**Calculations and Thoughts:**\n\n- Let's calculate the Euclidean distances between the points \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(R\\):\n\n1. **Distance \\(PQ\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance } PQ = \\sqrt{(8 - 7)^2 + (8 - 12)^2 + (1 - 10)^2}\n   = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-4)^2 + (-9)^2}\n   = \\sqrt{1 + 16 + 81}\n   = \\sqrt{98}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distance \\(QR\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance } QR = \\sqrt{(11 - 8)^2 + (3 - 8)^2 + (9 - 1)^2}\n   = \\sqrt{3^2 + (-5)^2 + 8^2}\n   = \\sqrt{9 + 25 + 64}\n   = \\sqrt{98}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distance \\(PR\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance } PR = \\sqrt{(11 - 7)^2 + (3 - 12)^2 + (9 - 10)^2}\n   = \\sqrt{4^2 + (-9)^2 + (-1)^2}\n   = \\sqrt{16 + 81 + 1}\n   = \\sqrt{98}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection and Checking:**\n\n- All distances are equal; each pair has a distance of \\(\\sqrt{98}\\).\n- Given three equidistant points in space all having the same distance from each other suggests these could form an equilateral triangle.\n\n**Realization and Revision:**\n\n- Wait, a cube's geometry might not immediately form an equilateral triangle. That's critical to reconsider. \n- I should verify if these distances could represent diagonals of the cube.\n\n**Conceptual Understanding:**\n\n- The length of a face diagonal in a cube refers to the diagonal across a face, calculated by side length \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n- A space diagonal is calculated by side length \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nRe-examine \\(\\sqrt{98}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{98} = \\sqrt{49 \\cdot 2} = 7\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n- This result \\(7\\sqrt{2}\\) aligns with a face diagonal of a cube.\n\n**Conclusion and Answer:**\n\n- If \\(7\\sqrt{2}\\) is the face diagonal, then the side length \\(s\\) of the cube satisfies:\n  \\[\n  s\\sqrt{2} = 7\\sqrt{2} \\Rightarrow s = 7.\n  \\]\n- Thus, the side length of the cube is 7.\n\nThis confirms that using distances and cube geometry knowledge led us to correctly deduce the side length.",
