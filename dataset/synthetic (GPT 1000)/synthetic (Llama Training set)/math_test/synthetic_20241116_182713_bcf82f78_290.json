    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, we have three equations involving the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The objective is to find the sum \\(a + b + c\\). The equations are mixed with \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), so it seems that substituting values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) or considering special cases might simplify things. Let's brainstorm a bit.\n\n### Brainstorming Initial Approach\n\n1. **Substitution or Elimination**: One could either try to express \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) directly by equating coefficients or substituting specific values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n2. **Look for Patterns**: There might be symmetry or specific relations between the equations that simplify finding \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n3. **Direct Calculation**: Check if manipulating these expressions directly can lead to finding a sum for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\nI'm leaning towards comparing coefficients or leveraging special values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to simplify the equations. Let's start by examining the equations more closely.\n\n### Analyzing the Equations\n\n1. \\(ax + by + c = x + 7\\)\n2. \\(a + bx + cy = 2x + 6y\\)\n3. \\(ay + b + cx = 4x + y\\)\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n- Since the equations involve \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) on the right-hand side, try setting \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = 0\\) alternatively. This might help reduce the complexity.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Set \\(x = 0\\):**\n\n1. \\( a(0) + by + c = 0 + 7 \\rightarrow by + c = 7 \\)\n2. \\( a + b(0) + cy = 0 + 6y \\rightarrow a + cy = 6y \\)\n3. \\( ay + b + c(0) = 0 + y \\rightarrow ay + b = y \\)\n\nThis doesn't simplify much directly, so let\u2019s set \\( y = 0 \\):\n\n**Set \\(y = 0\\):**\n\n1. \\( ax + b(0) + c = x + 7 \\rightarrow ax + c = x + 7 \\)\n2. \\( a + bx + c(0) = 2x + 0 \\rightarrow a + bx = 2x \\)\n3. \\( a(0) + b + cx = 4x + 0 \\rightarrow b + cx = 4x \\)\n\nInteresting, it seems like setting \\(x = 1\\) could further simplify this. Let\u2019s try evaluating the system for \\(x = 1\\):\n\n**Set \\(x = 1\\):**\n\n- From \\(ax + c = x + 7\\): \\(a(1) + c = 1 + 7 \\rightarrow a + c = 8\\)\n- From \\(a + bx = 2x\\): \\(a + b(1) = 2(1) \\rightarrow a + b = 2\\)\n- From \\(b + cx = 4x\\): \\(b + c(1) = 4(1) \\rightarrow b + c = 4\\)\n\nHere's where something nice happens:\n\n- \\(a + b = 2\\)\n- \\(b + c = 4\\)\n- \\(a + c = 8\\)\n\nNow, let's add these equations:\n\nAdding the first two: \\(a + b + b + c = 2 + 4 \\rightarrow a + 2b + c = 6\\).\n\nNow, subtract this from the equation with \\(a + c = 8\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + c) - (a + 2b + c) = 8 - 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-2b = -2 \\rightarrow b = 1\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(b = 1\\) back:\n\nFrom \\(a + b = 2\\): \\(a + 1 = 2 \\rightarrow a = 1\\).\n\nFrom \\(b + c = 4\\): \\(1 + c = 4 \\rightarrow c = 3\\).\n\nFinally, sum \\(a + b + c\\):\n\n\\[ a + b + c = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 \\]\n\n#### Check and Reflect\n\n- Quick verification: \n  - Substituting \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 3\\) back into any of the initial equations satisfies them.\n  - Reflecting on patterns or assumptions, the choice of setting specific values was strategic to simplify the system here correctly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculated sum \\(a + b + c = 5\\) satisfies the given system under various assumptions. Reflecting on each step ensured no oversights in solving the system, and all values fit the set constraints and equation manipulations.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error. Let's revisit the problem and explore a more structured approach to solve it correctly this time.\n\nWhen faced with a system of equations like this, it's often beneficial to look for systemic symmetries or possibilities for simplifications that were not initially apparent. My previous approach was a direct attempt that didn't leverage the symmetry between the equations. Let's examine the structure more deeply.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Equations\nGiven the system:\n1. \\( ax + by + c = x + 7 \\)\n2. \\( a + bx + cy = 2x + 6y \\)\n3. \\( ay + b + cx = 4x + y \\)\n\n### New Strategy: Look for Symmetry and Factorization\n\nNotice that each equation's left side consists of terms with the same degree and seems symmetric. Thus, adding all three equations might reveal a hidden pattern.\n\n### Adding All Equations\n\nLet's add all three equations together:\n\n\\[\n(ax + by + c) + (a + bx + cy) + (ay + b + cx) = (x + 7) + (2x + 6y) + (4x + y)\n\\]\n\nSimplify both sides:\n- Left side: \n  \\[\n  ax + by + c + a + bx + cy + ay + b + cx = a(x+1+y) + b(y+x+1) + c(1+y+x)\n  \\]\n  Factor out \\((1 + x + y)\\):\n  \\[\n  (a+b+c)(1 + x + y)\n  \\]\n\n- Right side:\n  \\[\n  x + 7 + 2x + 6y + 4x + y = 7x + 7y + 7\n  \\]\n  Factor out 7:\n  \\[\n  7(1 + x + y)\n  \\]\n\n### Solve for \\(a + b + c\\)\n\nEquating the left and right sides, we have:\n\\[\n(a+b+c)(1 + x + y) = 7(1 + x + y)\n\\]\n\nSince we're given that \\(x + y \\neq -1\\) (so \\(1 + x + y \\neq 0\\)), we can safely divide both sides by \\((1 + x + y)\\) to find:\n\\[\na + b + c = 7\n\\]\n\n### Verification and Conclusion\n\nThis solution aligns with the symmetry and structure of the equations. By re-evaluating the system with a focus on symmetry, I found a direct path to the result. The sum of \\(a + b + c\\) is indeed \\(\\boxed{7}\\).\n\nReflecting on this, the key was noticing that adding equations and considering the overall structure could simplify the problem significantly\u2014a valuable lesson in problem-solving for systems of equations with symmetric forms.",
