    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step and I'll narrate my thought process as we go along.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe given quadratic equation is \\( x^2 - 5x + 9 = 0 \\). We are tasked with finding the value of \\((a - 1)(b - 1)\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the solutions of this equation.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- At first glance, this looks like a straightforward quadratic problem. Given the use of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it hints that we might need to rely on the properties of quadratic roots.\n\n- I'm reminded that for a quadratic equation of the form \\(x^2 + px + q = 0\\), the sum and product of the roots can be found using Vieta's formulas: \\( a + b = -p \\) and \\( ab = q \\).\n\n- Let's apply Vieta's formulas to the equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 9 = 0\\).\n\n**Applying Vieta's Formulas:**\n\n- From \\(x^2 - 5x + 9 = 0\\), we can identify \\(p = -5\\) and \\(q = 9\\).\n\n- Therefore, using Vieta's formulas:\n  - \\( a + b = 5 \\)\n  - \\( ab = 9 \\)\n\nThese give the relationships between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n**Reflecting on the Task:**\n\n- We need to calculate \\((a-1)(b-1)\\). Hmm, how should we approach that? \n\n- Maybe expanding \\((a-1)(b-1)\\) could help. Let's try that.\n\n**Expanding \\((a-1)(b-1)\\):**\n\n\\[\n(a-1)(b-1) = ab - a - b + 1\n\\]\n\n- From Vieta, we already know:\n  - \\( ab = 9 \\)\n  - \\( a + b = 5 \\)\n\n- Plugging these into the expanded expression gives:\n  \\[\n  (a-1)(b-1) = 9 - 5 + 1 = 5\n  \\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- That result seems reasonable. I've used the properties and some basic algebra which feels correct given the initial conditions.\n\n- Let me quickly double-check the expansion and calculations in case there was a slip: \n  \\[\n  (a-1)(b-1) = ab - a - b + 1 = 9 - 5 + 1 = 5\n  \\]\n\nYes, everything checks out correctly. We followed the algebra properly, using known relations from Vieta's formulas. This confirms that the calculations seem error-free.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n- The value of \\((a - 1)(b - 1)\\) is **5**.\n\nThis was a manageable problem once the initial relationships were clear, and confirms the method and solution are consistent and accurate.",

If $a$ and $b$ are roots of this quadratic, then Vieta's formulas give us that $ab = 9$ and $a + b = 5$. Substituting these values, we find that $(a - 1)(b - 1) = 9 - 5 + 1 = \\boxed{5}$."
