  "problem": "A restaurant offers three desserts, and exactly twice as many appetizers as main courses. A dinner consists of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert. What is the least number of main courses that the restaurant should offer so that a customer could have a different dinner each night in the year 2003?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by methodically thinking through each part. We need to determine the least number of main courses a restaurant should offer so a customer could have a different dinner each night of the year 2003. That's 365 different dinners.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**  \nHmm, this problem is about combination possibilities. We have variables: appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Given the relationships between them, I need to dig deeper into how these combinations work out.\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - There are three types of dishes: appetizers, main courses, and desserts.\n   - The restaurant offers three desserts.\n\n2. **Key Insight:**\n   - The number of appetizers is exactly twice the number of main courses.\n   - A dinner consists of one appetizer, one main course, and one dessert.\n\n3. **Breaking It Down:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) represent the number of main courses.\n   - Then the number of appetizers, according to the problem, is \\( 2x \\).\n   - Therefore, the total number of combinations we can have is given by the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total combinations} = (\\text{Number of appetizers}) \\times (\\text{Number of main courses}) \\times (\\text{Number of desserts})\n     \\]\n     So, substituting our variables, it becomes:\n     \\[\n     2x \\times x \\times 3\n     \\]  \n     which simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     6x^2\n     \\]\n\n4. **Set up the Equation:**\n   - We want at least 365 different dinners because there are 365 days in a year. Therefore, we set up the inequality:\n     \\[\n     6x^2 \\geq 365\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - First, divide 365 by 6 to simplify:\n     \\[\n     x^2 \\geq \\frac{365}{6} \\approx 60.83\n     \\]\n   - Next, find \\( x \\) by calculating the square root:\n     \\[\n     x \\geq \\sqrt{60.83} \\approx 7.8\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( x \\) must be a whole number (you can't have fractional courses), we round up to the nearest whole number, giving:\n     \\[\n     x = 8\n     \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet's reflect on whether this makes sense. By choosing \\( x = 8 \\):\n- The number of main courses is 8.\n- The number of appetizers is \\( 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\).\n- The number of desserts remains 3.\n\nCheck the total combinations:\n- \\( 16 \\times 8 \\times 3 = 384 \\)\n\nYes, 384 dinners are indeed greater than 365, allowing a different dinner each night.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe least number of main courses the restaurant should offer is 8. This methodically checks out, since we've ensured our combinations exceed the desired number of unique dinners. It seems our logical steps are correct and our calculations consistent. \n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIf I reduced the main courses to 7:\n- \\( 14 \\times 7 \\times 3 = 294 \\)\n- Clearly, 294 is too small. This confirms that \\( x = 8 \\) is indeed the correct minimum to ensure customers can have a different meal every night. \n\nGreat! We've reached a checked and verified conclusion.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $m$ denote the number of main courses needed to meet the requirement. Then the number of dinners available is $3\\cdot m \\cdot 2m = 6m^2$.  Thus $m^2$ must be at least $365/6 \\approx 61$.  Since $7^2 = 49<61<64 = 8^2$, $\\boxed{8}$ main courses is enough, but 7 is not."
