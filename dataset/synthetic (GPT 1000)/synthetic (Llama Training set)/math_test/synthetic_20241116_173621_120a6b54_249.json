    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\nI'm looking at the function \\( k(y) = \\frac{1}{2y+1} \\). Immediately, the presence of the denominator \\(2y + 1\\) catches my attention. From experience, I know that division by zero is undefined, so I'll need to ensure that \\(2y + 1\\) is not equal to zero. My initial thought is to set up an equation to find values of \\(y\\) that might cause division by zero, and then exclude that from the domain. So, let's explore this path first.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Identify the Issue: Division by Zero**\n\n   I need to consider where the function might be undefined. This typically happens when the denominator equals zero. I'll start by setting the denominator equal to zero and solving for \\(y\\).\n\n   \\[\n   2y + 1 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Solve for \\(y\\)**\n\n   Now I'll solve this simple linear equation:\n\n   \\[\n   2y = -1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = -\\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Alright, if \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), the denominator becomes zero, leading to division by zero. This means \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}\\) is not in the domain of the function.\n\n3. **Define the Domain**\n\n   Since the function is undefined at \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), I need to exclude this value from the domain. Thinking about this, the domain should include all real numbers except \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n   Using interval notation, the domain is:\n   \\[\n   (-\\infty, -\\frac{1}{2}) \\cup \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\infty\\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Check My Work**\n\n   Let's verify this solution. Intuitively, substituting \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}\\) into \\(2y + 1\\):\n   \n   \\[\n   2(-\\frac{1}{2}) + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   Yep, that leads to division by zero, so excluding \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}\\) is correct. The intervals around it should capture all other values of \\(y\\).\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nReflecting on this process, my initial strategy of addressing the denominator directly made sense and led smoothly to the solution. There's no need for a different method here as it was a straightforward rational function problem regarding division by zero.\n\nThis approach and solution feel correct after checking my work. The domain in interval notation is indeed \\((- \\infty, -\\frac{1}{2}) \\cup \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\infty\\right)\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The fraction $\\frac{1}{2y+1}$ fails to be defined only if the denominator is zero. This occurs when $y$ is the solution of the equation $$2y+1=0,$$ which is $y=-\\frac 12$. Thus the domain of $k(y)$ is $$\\boxed{\\left(-\\infty,-\\frac 12\\right)\\cup \\left(-\\frac 12,\\infty\\right)}.$$"
