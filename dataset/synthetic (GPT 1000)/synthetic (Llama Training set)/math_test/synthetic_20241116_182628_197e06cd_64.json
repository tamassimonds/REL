    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, with plenty of reflection and exploration along the way. Here we go:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nSo we have a sequence \\((a_n)\\) defined by an initial condition and a recurrence relation. I'm given:\n- \\(a_1 = 1\\)\n- \\(a_2 = 2\\)\n- The relation \\(a_n^2 - a_{n - 1} a_{n + 1} = 1\\) for \\(n \\ge 2\\)\n\nThe task is to determine \\(a_{100}\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\nThis recurrence relation isn't like the standard linear ones I've encountered before. The quadratic nature of the equation is a bit intimidating. However, this seems vaguely reminiscent of some kind of Pell's equation or maybe something related to continued fractions. I should explore this similarity more.\n\n### Step 2: Work Through the First Few Terms\nLet's manually calculate some of the terms to see if we can identify a pattern or get some insight:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(a_3\\):**\n   - Use \\(n = 2\\): \\(a_2^2 - a_1 a_3 = 1\\)\n   - \\(2^2 - 1 \\cdot a_3 = 1\\) \\(\\Rightarrow 4 - a_3 = 1\\) \\(\\Rightarrow a_3 = 3\\)\n\n2. **Calculate \\(a_4\\):**\n   - Use \\(n = 3\\): \\(a_3^2 - a_2 a_4 = 1\\)\n   - \\(3^2 - 2 \\cdot a_4 = 1\\) \\(\\Rightarrow 9 - 2a_4 = 1\\) \\(\\Rightarrow 2a_4 = 8\\) \\(\\Rightarrow a_4 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Calculate \\(a_5\\):**\n   - Use \\(n = 4\\): \\(a_4^2 - a_3 a_5 = 1\\)\n   - \\(4^2 - 3 \\cdot a_5 = 1\\) \\(\\Rightarrow 16 - 3a_5 = 1\\) \\(\\Rightarrow 3a_5 = 15\\) \\(\\Rightarrow a_5 = 5\\)\n\nHmm, something interesting is emerging... Could it be that \\(a_n = n\\)?\n\n### Step 3: Check the Assumed General Formula\nI suspect \\(a_n = n\\) might be the rule for this sequence. Let's check mathematically if it fits for all elements given the recurrence relation:\n\n1. Suppose \\(a_n = n\\).\n\n2. Plug into \\(a_n^2 - a_{n-1}a_{n+1} = 1\\):\n   - \\(a_n = n \\Rightarrow n^2 - (n-1)(n+1) = 1\\)\n   - Simplify \\(n^2 - (n^2 - 1) = 1\\)\n   - \\(n^2 - n^2 + 1 = 1\\), which holds true!\n\nSo my hunch was correct! The sequence is just \\(a_n = n\\).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nSince I validated that \\(a_n = n\\) satisfies the recurrence relation and the initial conditions, finding \\(a_{100}\\) is straightforward:\n\n\\[a_{100} = 100\\]\n\n### Reflection\nThis was quite a satisfying problem as it involved recognizing a pattern and validating it with algebraic substitution. It's not every day you see a quadratic recurrence simplify so nicely! Looking back, manually computing the first few terms was key in identifying the pattern quickly.\n\nAnyways, score one for pattern recognition. Neat!",
