    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nFirst, let's break down the question and make sure we really understand what it's asking. Donut Haven fries donuts in batches of 20 and sells them in boxes of 13. They want to know how many donuts will be left over after packing 44 full boxes of 13 donuts each, using batches of 20 donuts to supply those boxes.\n\nHmm, okay, so the task is essentially about matching the number of fried donuts with the number required for packing while dealing with different quantities (batches vs. boxes). It's about ensuring all donuts are accounted for and figuring out if there are any excess.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Total Donuts Needed**\n\nDonut Haven packs 44 full boxes of 13 donuts. Let's figure out the total number of donuts required for these 44 boxes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total donuts needed} = 44 \\times 13 \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[ 44 \\times 13 = 572 \\]\n\nOkay, so Donut Haven needs 572 donuts in total to fill 44 boxes.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Batches Required**\n\nNow, let's think about how many batches of 20 donuts we need to fry to ensure we can have at least 572 donuts. Each batch has 20 donuts.\n\nI will calculate how many whole batches of 20 are necessary to at least match or exceed 572:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of batches required} = \\lceil \\frac{572}{20} \\rceil \\]\n\nDividing and checking:\n\n\\[ 572 \\div 20 = 28.6 \\]\n\nSince you can't fry a fraction of a batch, I need to round up. So, 29 batches are necessary. This rounding checks out because we want a complete count of donuts.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Total Donuts Fried**\n\nNext step is to calculate the total number of donuts that are fried with these 29 batches:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total donuts fried} = 29 \\times 20 \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ 29 \\times 20 = 580 \\]\n\nThis means 580 donuts are fried.\n\n**Step 5: Determine Leftovers**\n\nFinally, the number of leftover donuts is the difference between the total number of donuts fried and the donuts needed to fill the boxes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Leftover donuts} = 580 - 572 \\]\n\nLet me do the subtraction to find the leftovers:\n\n\\[ 580 - 572 = 8 \\]\n\nOkay, so there are 8 donuts left over.\n\n**Step 6: Reflect on the Solution**\n\nLet me quickly check if all steps make sense:\n\n- We calculated the donuts needed (572) and confirmed exact requirements.\n- We correctly determined the number of batches required to meet or exceed this amount, correctly rounding up.\n- We verified how many donuts these batches produce and double-checked the subtraction for leftovers.\n\nThis seems to make sense, and everything checks out logically. Thus, 8 donuts will be left over after packing 44 full boxes using the batches produced.\n\nThe leftover calculation appears reasonable, as it\u2019s less than what would fill another box of 13, aligning with the context. So, this approach was successful!",

  "ground_truth": "We can solve this problem using modular arithmetic. Donut Haven needs to fry at least $44\\cdot 13$ donuts. Working modulo $20$, we have \\begin{align*}\n44\\cdot 13 &\\equiv 4\\cdot 13 \\\\\n&= 52 \\\\\n&\\equiv 12\\qquad\\pmod{20}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the number of donuts in $44$ full boxes is $12$ more than a multiple of $20$, which means it's $8$ less than the next multiple of $20$. Donut Haven will have $\\boxed{8}$ donuts left over."
