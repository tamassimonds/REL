This is often straightforward if we balance the equation by taking the square root of both sides.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\nLet's explore different approaches that might help solve this problem:\n\n1. **Taking the Square Root:** \n   - This seems simplest. Directly taking square roots on both sides could help in isolating \\( x + 3 \\).\n\n2. **Expanding and Forming a Quadratic Equation:**\n   - Another approach could be to expand \\((x + 3)^2\\) into \\(x^2 + 6x + 9 = 121\\) and solve it as a standard quadratic equation.\n\n3. **Graphical or Numerical Methods:**\n   - If analytical methods seem complex, graphing or numerical approximations can be used, but they don\u2019t seem necessary here.\n\nLet's start with the first approach.\n\n### Solving by Taking the Square Root\n\n**Approach 1: Direct Square Root Method**\n\n1. First step is to isolate \\( (x+3) \\) by taking the square root of both sides:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(x+3)^2} = \\pm\\sqrt{121}\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplifying both sides gives:\n\n   \\[\n   x + 3 = \\pm 11\n   \\]\n\n3. This results in two possible equations:\n   - \\( x + 3 = 11 \\)\n   - \\( x + 3 = -11 \\)\n\n4. Solving each equation:\n   - For \\( x + 3 = 11 \\), solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 11 - 3 = 8\n     \\]\n   \n   - For \\( x + 3 = -11 \\), solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = -11 - 3 = -14\n     \\]\n\nOkay, so our solutions for \\( x \\) are 8 and -14. \n\n### Summing the Solutions\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of these solutions:\n\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 = 8 + (-14)\n\\]\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 = 8 - 14 = -6\n\\]\n\n### Verification\n\nNow, let's verify quickly to make sure our approach holds water:\n\n- **Check for \\( x = 8 \\):**\n  \\[\n  (8+3)^2 = 11^2 = 121\n  \\]\n  True.\n\n- **Check for \\( x = -14 \\):**\n  \\[\n  (-14+3)^2 = (-11)^2 = 121\n  \\]\n  True.\n\nOur solutions are correctly satisfying the original equation, so the sum calculated should be correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter reflecting on the solution process, taking the square root directly was an efficient strategy here, as it quickly reduced the complexity by avoiding unnecessary algebra. The sum of the two values of \\( x \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-6}\n\\] \n\nThis detailed check not only fits the problem requirement but ensures confidence in the answer being -6.",

  "ground_truth": "Expanding the left side, we have $x^2+6x+9=121 \\Rightarrow x^2+6x-112=0$. For a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$. Applying this formula to the problem, we have that the sum of the two roots is $-6/1=\\boxed{-6}$."
