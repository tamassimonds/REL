    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step and really dive into my thought process as I go through it.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nAt first glance, the problem is about finding the mean of the measures of three exterior angles of a triangle, given that two interior angles are 63 and 78 degrees. I know that every triangle has three angles, and the sum of these interior angles is always 180 degrees. Exterior angles for each interior angle are supplementary (sum up to 180 degrees) because they form a linear pair with the interior angle.\n\nHmm, I remember exterior angles are interesting because, in a triangle, the sum of the exterior angles is always 360 degrees, no matter the shape of the triangle. That might be useful later. Let's note that down as a thought.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Third Interior Angle**\n\nLet's see, two of the interior angles are given: 63 degrees and 78 degrees. We're missing the third angle for the triangle. \n\nLet's calculate the third interior angle:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Sum of interior angles of a triangle} = 180^\\circ \n\\]\nSo,\n\\[ \n\\text{Third interior angle} = 180^\\circ - (63^\\circ + 78^\\circ) \n\\]\n\\[ \n= 180^\\circ - 141^\\circ = 39^\\circ \n\\]\n\nOkay, so the third interior angle is 39 degrees. Now let's pause and just make sure that makes sense. Adding those three up: 63 + 78 + 39 = 180 \u2014 yep, that checks out.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Exterior Angles**\n\nNow, with the interior angles being 63, 78, and 39 degrees, let's find the corresponding exterior angles. Since exterior angles form a linear pair with interior angles, they add up to 180 degrees.\n\nExterior angle corresponding to the 63-degree interior angle:\n\\[ \n180^\\circ - 63^\\circ = 117^\\circ \n\\]\n\nExterior angle corresponding to the 78-degree interior angle:\n\\[ \n180^\\circ - 78^\\circ = 102^\\circ \n\\]\n\nExterior angle corresponding to the 39-degree interior angle:\n\\[ \n180^\\circ - 39^\\circ = 141^\\circ \n\\]\n\nLet's pause and verify: If I've calculated everything correctly, summing them up should give us 360 degrees.\n\\[ \n117^\\circ + 102^\\circ + 141^\\circ = 360^\\circ \n\\]\nGreat, this makes sense.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Mean of the Exterior Angles**\n\nI need the mean of these three angles. The mean is just the sum of the values divided by the number of values.\n\nThe sum of the exterior angles is 360 degrees (we already calculated that), and we have three angles here.\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{3} = 120^\\circ \n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Reflect on the Solution**\n\nLet's take a moment to check if everything logically makes sense. Calculating the exterior angles based on the supplementary pair with given interior angles was straightforward. Checking the sum of 117, 102, and 141 matches the known fact that exterior angles sum up to 360 degrees in any triangle was a good check.\n\nThe mean, 120 degrees, also makes sense because each exterior angle takes part in completing the full circle (360 degrees) around the triangle. \n\nSo, all calculations align with known properties of triangles, and I'm pretty confident the mean of the measures of the three exterior angles is indeed 120 degrees. Everything checks out.\n\nThat felt pretty good! The steps seemed logical, and there were some satisfying checks along the way to confirm that nothing was off track.",
