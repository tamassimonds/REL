    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\nOkay, we're trying to find how many lattice points, or points with integer coordinates, the line \\(y = -2x + 18\\) passes through. Immediately, I recognize that this line has a negative slope and a y-intercept of 18. The line is defined for \\(x \\geq 0\\) and \\(y \\geq 0\\), so these restrictions will limit the range of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) we're interested in.\n\nInitial approach thoughts:\n\n1. **Understanding the line:** The equation \\(y = -2x + 18\\) gives us a line with a slope of \\(-2\\). This means for every unit increase in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) decreases by 2. The line will intersect the y-axis at \\(y = 18\\).\n\n2. **Finding intersections with axes:** The x-intercept can be found by setting \\(y = 0\\): \n   \\[\n   0 = -2x + 18 \\implies x = 9.\n   \\]\n   This tells us the line crosses the x-axis at \\(x = 9\\).\n\n3. **Checking boundaries:** We have the region \\(x \\geq 0\\) and \\(y \\geq 0\\), which means we are only interested in points within the first quadrant (including the edges of this quadrant).\n\nAlternate idea:\n\nHow about directly computing the lattice points using integer values of \\(x\\)? This method seems straightforward and manageable for this line equation. \n\nComputational approach:\n\n1. **Integer values of \\(x\\):** Since \\(x\\) must be non-negative and also cannot exceed 9 (from the x-intercept), let's list allowable integer values for \\(x\\): \\(0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\).\n\n2. **Calculating \\(y\\) for each \\(x\\):** For each integer \\(x\\), check if \\(y = -2x + 18\\) results in an integer.\n\n   - \\(x = 0\\): \\(y = -2(0) + 18 = 18\\) (integer)\n   - \\(x = 1\\): \\(y = -2(1) + 18 = 16\\) (integer)\n   - \\(x = 2\\): \\(y = -2(2) + 18 = 14\\) (integer)\n   - \\(x = 3\\): \\(y = -2(3) + 18 = 12\\) (integer)\n   - \\(x = 4\\): \\(y = -2(4) + 18 = 10\\) (integer)\n   - \\(x = 5\\): \\(y = -2(5) + 18 = 8\\) (integer)\n   - \\(x = 6\\): \\(y = -2(6) + 18 = 6\\) (integer)\n   - \\(x = 7\\): \\(y = -2(7) + 18 = 4\\) (integer)\n   - \\(x = 8\\): \\(y = -2(8) + 18 = 2\\) (integer)\n   - \\(x = 9\\): \\(y = -2(9) + 18 = 0\\) (integer)\n\nChecking work:\n\nQuickly reviewing, every time we computed \\(y = -2x + 18\\) for integer \\(x\\) values \\(0\\) through \\(9\\), \\(y\\) also came out as an integer. This confirms that these are indeed valid lattice points, as both coordinates are integers.\n\nConcluding thoughts:\n\nIt looks like the line crosses exactly ten lattice points. I double-checked each \\(x\\) value and confirmed the corresponding \\(y\\) values remain within bounds (all non-negative and integers). Everything checks out.\n\nSo, the number of lattice points the line passes through is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We look at the $x$-intercept and the $y$-intercept. Since $y = -2(x - 9)$, at $x = 0,\\; y = 18$, and at $x = 9,\\; y = 0$, the $y$-intercept is $(0,18)$ and the $x$-intercept is $(9,0)$. In order to keep both $x$ and $y$ integral, we investigate further. Since the slope is $-2$, a negative integer, and $y$ must be a nonnegative integer, $x - 9$ must be a nonpositive integer. This means that all the integer $x$ values between 0 and $9$, inclusive are valid, since $x \\leq 9$ and so $x - 9 \\leq 0$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{10}$ total lattice points."
