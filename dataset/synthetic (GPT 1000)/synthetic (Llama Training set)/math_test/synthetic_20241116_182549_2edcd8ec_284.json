  "problem": "In Mathopolis, an adult is a person 21 years of age or older and a child is a person under 21 years of age.  Exactly half of the  adults in Mathopolis are female, and exactly half of the female  adults have exactly one biological child.  Nobody else has a  child, and there are no other children.  What percent of the  people of Mathopolis are children?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem from Mathopolis step by step. At first glance, this problem involves categorizing a population into adults and children, with additional conditions on the adults regarding gender and parental status.\n\n### First Thoughts\n- **Population Types**: The people in Mathopolis are divided into adults and children. Additionally, adults are split by gender and parental status.\n- **Key Conditions**: Exactly half of the adults are female, and half of these females have exactly one biological child.\n- **Objective**: Determine what percentage of the population consists of children.\n\n### Steps and Calculations\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the Adult Distribution\nI realize that the problem centers around how adults and children are related through the female adults.\n\n- **Adults and Gender**: Half of the adults are female. I'll assume the number of adults is \\( A \\).\n    - Therefore, \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) are female adults.\n\n- **Female Adults with Children**: Half of the female adults have one child.\n    - This means \\( \\frac{A}{4} \\) female adults have a child.\n\n#### Step 2: Understand the Child Population\n\n- **Child Calculation**: Every child corresponds to a female adult with exactly one child. That simplifies it because each of those \\( \\frac{A}{4} \\) female adults has exactly one child, resulting in \\( \\frac{A}{4} \\) children.\n  \n  So far, this makes sense. Quick check:\n  - Adults are divided equally by gender: \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) males and \\( \\frac{A}{2} \\) females.\n  - Half of females have one child, which means a straightforward one-to-one correspondence to \\( \\frac{A}{4} \\) children.\n\n#### Step 3: Total Population and Calculation of Percentage of Children\n\n- **Total Population**: The total population consists of adults and children.\n  - Total people = \\( A + \\frac{A}{4} \\)\n  - Simplified: \\( \\frac{5A}{4} \\)\n\n- **Percent of Population That Are Children**:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Percentage of Children} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Number of Children}}{\\text{Total Population}}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(\\frac{\\frac{A}{4}}{\\frac{5A}{4}}\\right) \\times 100\n  \\]\n\n  - Cancel out \\( A \\) from numerator and denominator:  \n  \\[\n  = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\times 100 = 20\\%\n  \\]\n\n### Reflect and Confirm\nThe math checks out:\n- The distribution followed the conditions closely.\n- Half of females having a single child directly results in a clear proportion of children.\n- Calculating based on proportions avoids needing to know the actual number of adults.\n\nI believe the approach logically connects all the conditions given, and the 20% calculation aligns with all the relationships described. The result feels right given the problem's structure. If anything feels off, it's usually good to double-check the setup, but this seems solid.\n\n### Conclusion\n20% of Mathopolis's population are children. This approach seems comprehensive and reflective of all conditions described.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the percentage of people in Mathopolis who are children be $x$. The percentage of adults is then $1-x$. Half the adults are female, and half the females have exactly one child, so the percentage of people who are females with a child is $\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. This percentage is equal to the percentage of children, since there is a correspondence between a mother and a child. So we have the equation $x=\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. Solving for $x$ yields $x=1/5$, or $\\boxed{20}$ percent."
