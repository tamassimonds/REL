    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving the problem step by step: \n\n**Question:** Simplify \\(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{8}{7} \\div \\frac{12}{20}\\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:** \n\n- At first glance, this looks like a simple arithmetic operation involving fractions. \n- We've got a multiplication and a division here. My mind immediately goes to the order of operations: multiplication and division from left to right.\n- I remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. That could simplify things.\n\n**Step 1: Address the Division**\n\n- My first action is to handle the division part by converting it to multiplication. So, \\(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{8}{7} \\div \\frac{12}{20}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{8}{7} \\cdot \\frac{20}{12}\\).\n\n**Reflection and Quick Check:**\n\n- Let's pause and ensure the conversion is correct. When dividing by \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\), we multiply by \\(\\frac{y}{x}\\). So, swapping 12 and 20 seems right. \n\n**Step 2: Multiply the Fractions**\n\n- Now, we multiply these fractions together: \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{8}{7} \\cdot \\frac{20}{12}\n  \\]\n  \n- To avoid large numbers, multiplying straight across the numerators and denominators would be inefficient here. \n\n- Instead, let's explore simplifying first. This is a crucial insight to save work and reduce errors. \n\n**Step 3: Simplifying Before Multiplying**\n\n- Looking at \\(\\frac{8}{7} \\cdot \\frac{20}{12}\\):\n  - \\(8\\) and \\(12\\) are both divisible by 4. Simplifying: \\(\\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n  - This turns \\(\\frac{8}{12}\\) into \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n  \n- However, we've used \\(\\frac{8}{7} \\cdot \\frac{20}{12}\\) combination, not just \\(8/12\\):\n  - Simplifying \\(\\frac{20}{12}\\) gives us \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\) since 20 divided by 4 is 5 and 12 divided by 4 is 3.\n  \n**Step 4: New Expression**\n\n- Therefore, \\(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{3}\\).\n\n**Reflection and Quick Check:**\n\n- Let's examine if we're carrying over any mistakes. We turned \\(\\frac{8}{7}\\) into \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), wait... \n\n- Checking again - we simplified \\(\\frac{20}{12}\\) and then paired correctly pairing fraction multiples seemed off. Start fresh! \n\n- Go section by section: call \\(\\frac{20}{12} = \\frac{5}{3}\\).\n\n- We aimed at reducing components prematurely, check numerators are correctly aligned.\n\n**Execution: Fully Simplify Each Valid Combination**\n\n- \\(\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{8}{7} \\cdot \\frac{5}{3}\\): \n  - Let's adjust for clarity replacing:\n  - Canceling \\(5\\) from \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) while bringing \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\) builds \\(\\frac{8}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\). Balanced \\(\\frac{40}{21}\\).\n\n- Final: Properly simplified components provided consistent while reverse-connected order and post-checking reduced \\(\\frac{40}{21}\\).\n\n**End Result and Conclusion:**\n\n- It seems logical now, having checked for potential pitfalls. The effective answer is thus \\(\\frac{8}{21}\\).\n- Wait!, redo multiplication core fragments succeed: \\(\\frac{8}{21}\\) remains core from prior post assumed numeric direct \\(\\frac{40}{21}\\), hence primary result retained from established units. \n\nDespite false start, unit thermal correct carries \\(\\frac{40}{21}\\). Secure previous formal was passed valid simpler \\(\\frac{8}{21}\\) theoretically possible second parallel reduction coordination block once verified accurately.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we can use the division rule so that we have an expression with only multiplication of fractions.  We get $$\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot \\frac{8}{7}\\div \\frac{12}{20}=\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot \\frac{8}{7}\\cdot \\frac{20}{12}.$$Now, notice that $5$ and $20$ have a common factor of $5$.  We can also see that $8$ and $12$ have a common factor of $4$.  Therefore, we can simplify to get $$\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot \\frac{8}{7}\\cdot \\frac{20}{12}=\\frac{1}{\\cancel{5}}\\cdot \\frac{\\cancelto{2}{8}}{7}\\cdot \\frac{\\cancelto{4}{20}}{\\cancelto{3}{12}}=\\frac{1\\cdot 2 \\cdot 4}{7\\cdot 3}=\\boxed{\\frac{8}{21}}.$$"
