    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. My task is to determine the value of \\(5 \\star 1\\) given the operation \\(a \\star b = 9a + 2b - ab + 5\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nHmm, okay... I need to interpret the provided operation \\(a \\star b\\). This operation isn't like the standard mathematical operations I'm used to (like addition or multiplication), but rather a custom mathematical expression involving variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n### Understanding the Operation\nThe operation is defined as \\(a \\star b = 9a + 2b - ab + 5\\). Each occurrence of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is meant to be substituted with whatever numbers or values I choose to operate with. It looks like a combination of linear terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), a cross term \\(-ab\\), and a constant \\(5\\).\n\n### Identifying the Given Task\nI'm asked to find \\(5 \\star 1\\). So in this expression, \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = 1\\). \n\n### Strategy for Solving\n- Substitute \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = 1\\) into the expression. \n- Calculate step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\n### Substitution\n1. **Substitute \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = 1\\) into the formula:**\n\n   \\[\n   5 \\star 1 = 9(5) + 2(1) - (5)(1) + 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate each term:**\n   - For the first term \\(9a: 9 \\times 5 = 45\\).\n   - For the second term \\(2b: 2 \\times 1 = 2\\).\n   - For the third term \\(-ab: -(5 \\times 1) = -5\\).\n   - The constant term is \\(+5\\).\n\n### Combining the Results\n3. **Add all the computed parts together:**\n   \\[\n   45 + 2 - 5 + 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Step-by-step addition and subtraction:**\n   - \\(45 + 2 = 47\\)\n   - \\(47 - 5 = 42\\)\n   - \\(42 + 5 = 47\\)\n\n### Verification\nLet me reflect on what I did... Did I include all the terms? Did I substitute correctly? These calculations appear consistent with each logical step.\n\n### Final Result\nAfter checking my work, everything seems correct. \n\nThe value of \\(5 \\star 1\\) is \\(47\\).\n\nThis matches the expected operation structure and follows the order of operations effectively. Each step logically follows from the substitution to the final arithmetic, ensuring the custom operation is executed properly.",
