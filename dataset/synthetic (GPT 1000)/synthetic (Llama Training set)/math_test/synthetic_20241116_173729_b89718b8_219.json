    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Brainstorming\n\n- **Understanding the Problem**: We are given a quadrilateral with vertices \\((-1, 0)\\), \\((0, 1)\\), \\((2, 0)\\), and \\((0, -3)\\). We need to calculate its area.\n- **Shape Visualization**: It might be helpful to plot the points on a coordinate plane to understand the shape. \n\n```\nPlotting the Points:\n(-1, 0): Left of the y-axis\n(0, 1): Above the x-axis\n(2, 0): Right of the y-axis\n(0, -3): Below the x-axis\n```\n\n- The points form a convex quadrilateral. That tells us the shape bulges outwards, and any straight line drawn through the shape will intersect its boundary at most two times.\n\n### Strategies to Find the Area\n\n1. **Breaking into Triangles**: Quadrilateral areas can often be determined by dividing the shape into triangles, finding the area of each triangle, and summing them up. \n2. **Shoelace Formula**: This formula (or Gauss's area formula) for polygons works directly with vertex coordinates which seems apt for this problem.\n3. **Trapezoidal Method**: Calculating the area of a trapezoid can work if the figure easily divides into trapezoidal sections.\n4. **Check for Symmetry**: None of the axes aligning suggests symmetry, so we'll plan on a more general solution.\n\n### Starting with the Shoelace Formula (since it directly uses vertices)\n\nThe formula is:  \n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\sum (x_iy_{i+1} - y_ix_{i+1}) \\right| \\]\n\nVertices in order (using clockwise/counterclockwise):\n1. \\((-1, 0)\\)\n2. \\((0, 1)\\)\n3. \\((2, 0)\\)\n4. \\((0, -3)\\)\n\nAnd back to \\((-1, 0)\\) to complete the loop.\n\n### Calculating Using Shoelace Formula\n\n**Write down coordinates:**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(-1, 0) \\\\\n(0, 1) \\\\\n(2, 0) \\\\\n(0, -3) \\\\\n(-1, 0) \\quad \\text{(repeated to close polygon)}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Cross-multiplying sums:**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n-1 \\cdot 1 & = -1 \\\\\n0 \\cdot 0 & = 0 \\\\\n2 \\cdot -3 & = -6 \\\\\n0 \\cdot 0 & = 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nSum of cross-products = \\(-1 + 0 + -6 + 0 = -7\\)\n\n**Cross-multiplying in reverse order:**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n0 \\cdot 0 & = 0 \\\\\n1 \\cdot 2 & = 2 \\\\\n0 \\cdot 0 & = 0 \\\\\n-3 \\cdot -1 & = 3 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nSum of reverse cross-products = \\(0 + 2 + 0 + 3 = 5\\)\n\n**Calculate the Area:**\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (-7) - (5) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion and Verification\n\n- **Verification**: I used a systematic approach that I feel is correct. \n- **Reflection**: The shoelace method is a handy tool for this kind of problem as it directly uses coordinates and minimizes calculation mistakes.\n- **Discussion**: If this were a test setting and I had time, checking this with another method, like dividing into triangles, could provide double assurance.\n\nI conclude the area of the quadrilateral is **6 square units**.",

We will find the desired area by breaking the quadrilateral into two triangles $ABC$ and $CDA$. The area of $ABC$ is $\\frac{AC\\cdot BO}{2}=\\frac{3 \\cdot 1}{2}=\\frac{3}{2}$. The area of $CDA$ is $\\frac{AC \\cdot DO}{2}=\\frac{3\\cdot3}{2}=\\frac{9}{2}$. The total area is $3/2+9/2=\\boxed{6}$ square units."
