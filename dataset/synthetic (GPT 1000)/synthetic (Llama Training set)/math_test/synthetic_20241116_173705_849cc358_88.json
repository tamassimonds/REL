    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're tasked with computing the sum of some binomial coefficients: \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}+\\dbinom{4}{1}+\\dbinom{4}{2}+\\dbinom{4}{3}+\\dbinom{4}{4}\\). \n\nFirst Impression:\n- This problem reminds me of the binomial theorem or the properties of binomial coefficients. There's a pattern in the indices of the coefficients, and they're all part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\).\n  \n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n- The problem is essentially asking for the sum of the binomial coefficients for the expansion of \\((1 + 1)^4\\) because each \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\) represents the coefficient of \\(a^{4-k}b^k\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).\n- So, the sum \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}+\\dbinom{4}{1}+\\dbinom{4}{2}+\\dbinom{4}{3}+\\dbinom{4}{4}\\) is actually equal to \\(2^4\\) due to the identity \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\\) with \\(a = b = 1\\).\n\n**Step 2: Direct Calculation Approach**\n- Let\u2019s compute each term to verify:\n  - \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\) because there is only one way to choose zero elements.\n  - \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\) because there are four possibilities to choose one element from four.\n  - \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) as calculated using \\(\\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\\).\n  - \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\) by symmetry, or using \\(\\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 4\\).\n  - \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\) because there is only one way to choose all four elements.\n\n**Step 3: Sum the Coefficients**\n- Add them up: \\(1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 16\\).\n\n**Step 4: Cross-Verification with Binomial Theorem**\n- According to the identity: The sum should be \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n- This confirms our computed sum matches with what is expected by the binomial theorem, so our calculations are accurate.\n\nReflecting on our work now, everything seems correct:\n- We've ensured that both our direct calculations using combinatorial methods are correct.\n- The result matches the known theoretical result from the binomial theorem.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n- The sum of the binomial coefficients \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}+\\dbinom{4}{1}+\\dbinom{4}{2}+\\dbinom{4}{3}+\\dbinom{4}{4}\\) is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We have \\begin{align*}\n\\dbinom{4}{0}&+\\dbinom{4}{1}+\\dbinom{4}{2}+\\dbinom{4}{3}+\\dbinom{4}{4} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{4!}{0!4!} + \\dfrac{4!}{1!3!} + \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} + \\dfrac{4!}{3!1!} + \\dfrac{4!}{4!0!} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}{4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1} + \\dfrac{4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}{1\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1} + \\dfrac{4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}{2\\cdot 1\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}\\\\\n&\\qquad + \\dfrac{4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\cdot 1} + \\dfrac{4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}{4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1} \\\\\n&= 1 + 4 + \\dfrac{4\\cdot3}{2} + 4 + 1 \\\\\n&= 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{16}.\n\\end{align*}Notice that this is $2^4$. There is an explanation for this: $$\\dbinom{4}{0}+\\dbinom{4}{1}+\\dbinom{4}{2}+\\dbinom{4}{3}+\\dbinom{4}{4}$$is the sum of the number of ways to choose $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, or $4$ out of $4$ objects. This accounts for every way of choosing any number of the $4$ objects. There are $2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2 = 2^4$ ways of doing so, because there are two options for each object: choose that object or don't choose it."
