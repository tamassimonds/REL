    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem a bit. The question is asking how many workers are needed to paint 12 houses in three days, given that five workers can paint four houses in six days. This has a sort of \"work rate\" vibe to it, so I think breaking it down into smaller, digestible parts will really help.\n\n1. **Initial Thoughts**: This seems like one of those direct proportionality or rate problems. I remember doing something kind of similar back in school \u2014 it has a bit of \"work done = rate x time\" feel to it. But for now, I just want to brainstorm what I know versus what the problem is asking.\n\n2. **Understanding the Current Situation**: \n   - I have 5 workers.\n   - They complete 4 houses in 6 days.\n   - So, the workers here seem to be functioning at a set rate, and I\u2019ll need to figure out how to translate this rate to a different scenario.\n\n3. **Finding the Work Rate**:\n   - Let's try breaking this down. Five workers and 4 houses \u2014 they need 6 days. This seems like a good starting point.\n   - I think if I can figure out how many house-days one worker achieves, then I can scale that up.\n   - Each house requires \\( \\frac{6 \\text{ days} \\times 5 \\text{ workers}}{4 \\text{ houses}} = 7.5 \\text{ worker-days per house} \\). \n\n4. **Reflection**: \n   - Okay, that makes sense. So each house needs 7.5 worker-days. I can use this as a common ground to explore the new situation.\n   - Am I correct? Let's think \u2014 5 workers working 6 days is 30 worker-days, so for 4 houses, \\( \\frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \\) worker-days per house checks out. This calculation proves that the framing is working: great!\n\n5. **Applying to the New Situation**:\n   - Now, I need to paint 12 houses in 3 days.\n   - First, I'll find out how many worker-days in total are needed for 12 houses.\n   - 12 houses \u00d7 7.5 worker-days per house = 90 worker-days in total.\n\n6. **Determining the Number of Workers Required**:\n   - I need to achieve these 90 worker-days in 3 days. This implies I\u2019ll spread these across the three days.\n   - Workers needed = \\( \\frac{90 \\text{ worker-days}}{3 \\text{ days}} = 30 \\text{ workers} \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion and Double-Check**:\n   - Okay, so it seems that to accomplish the task of painting 12 houses in just 3 days, I require 30 workers.\n   - Let me quickly review the logic: yes, if each house needs 7.5 worker-days, and I have 12 houses \u2014 that does tally up to 90 worker-days. If split over 3 days, 30 workers seems consistent.\n   \nI think we've arrived at the solution correctly. Next, I\u2019ll calm down the overthinking and reflect if there\u2019s a simpler approach or a check needed. Making sure everything aligns by revisiting our steps doesn\u2019t reveal any obvious mistakes \u2014 everything fits! Therefore, 30 workers should be quite right.",

  "ground_truth": "Painting three times as many houses in the same amount of time requires three times as many workers.  If the job is to be done in half the time, then the number of workers required is multiplied by an additional factor of 2.  Therefore, 6 times as many workers are needed to paint 12 houses in 3 days as it takes to paint 4 houses in 6 days.  Since the latter task takes 5 workers, the former task takes $\\boxed{30}$ workers."
