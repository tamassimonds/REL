    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're given the equation \\(x^2 - 4y^2 = -8(y-1)^2 + 2x\\) and we need to determine which type of conic section it describes. Here are my initial thoughts and steps:\n\n### Brainstorming Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Familiarity Check:**\n   - This equation doesn't immediately look like one I'm familiar with directly as a conic form. Typically, conic sections (circle, ellipse, hyperbola, parabola) have standard forms, so I might need to manipulate this equation to see if it matches any of those.\n\n2. **Equation Structure:**\n   - There's a mix of terms here: \\(x^2\\), \\(y^2\\), \\(-8(y-1)^2\\), and \\(2x\\).\n   - The goal is to rearrange and simplify to hopefully recognize a standard conic form.\n\n3. **Exploring Strategy:**\n   - Simplify: Try to expand and collect like terms.\n   - Rearrange: Consider moving terms around to isolate like expressions.\n   - Compare: Once simplified, compare the structure against standard conic equations.\n\n### Simplifying the Equation:\n\n**Step 1: Expand and Simplify Terms**\n\nLet's start with the right-hand side: \n\n\\[-8(y-1)^2 = -8(y^2 - 2y + 1) = -8y^2 + 16y - 8.\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[x^2 - 4y^2 = -8y^2 + 16y - 8 + 2x.\\]\n\n**Step 2: Rearrange the Equation**\n\nNow, I'll bring all terms to one side for clarity:\n\n\\[x^2 - 4y^2 + 8y^2 - 16y + 8 - 2x = 0.\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[x^2 - (4y^2 - 8y^2) + 8 - 2x - 16y = 0.\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[x^2 + 4y^2 - 2x - 16y + 8 = 0.\\]\n\n**Step 3: Compare to Standard Conic Forms**\n\nThe standard forms are:\n- **Circle:** \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\)\n- **Ellipse:** \\(\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1\\)\n- **Hyperbola:** \\(\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1\\) or the reverse\n- **Parabola:** \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) or \\(x = ay^2 + by + c\\)\n\n**Step 4: Review and Determine**\n\nHmm, the rearranged equation \\(x^2 + 4y^2 - 2x - 16y + 8 = 0\\) involves both squared \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms, which suggests an ellipse or hyperbola. Additionally, since both squared variables appear with the same sign, it's likely an ellipse.\n\n**Reflection and Check:**\n\nOh! This reminds me to complete the square to be more sure. Let\u2019s complete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n**Step 5: Completing the Square for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)**\n\nFor \\(x\\): \\(x^2 - 2x\\) becomes \\((x-1)^2 - 1\\).\n\nFor \\(y\\): \\(4y^2 - 16y\\) becomes \\(4(y^2 - 4y) = 4((y-2)^2 - 4) = 4(y-2)^2 - 16\\).\n\nSubstituting these back:\n\n\\[\n(x-1)^2 - 1 + 4(y-2)^2 - 16 + 8 = 0.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n(x-1)^2 + 4(y-2)^2 - 9 = 0.\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n\\[\n(x-1)^2 + 4(y-2)^2 = 9.\n\\]\n\nWhich is indeed the equation of an ellipse (of the form \\((x-h)^2/a^2 + (y-k)^2/b^2 = 1\\)).\n\nConclusion: The conic section is an **Ellipse (E)**.\n\n### Final Check:\n\n- The equation is in the form of an ellipse. So, based on our analysis and checks, the answer is indeed **Ellipse (E)**.",

  "ground_truth": "The left-hand side contains $x^2$ and $y^2$ terms with opposite signs. But be careful! The right-hand side, when expanded, contains the term $-8y^2,$ and so when all the terms are moved to the left-hand side, the terms $x^2$ and $4y^2$ will appear. Because the coefficients of $x^2$ and $y^2$ are of the same signs but unequal, this conic section is an $\\boxed{(\\text{E})}$ ellipse."
