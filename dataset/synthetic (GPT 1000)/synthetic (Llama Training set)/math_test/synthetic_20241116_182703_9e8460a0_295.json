    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. The goal is to find the maximum value of the expression \\(\\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\) over all real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nAt first glance, this looks like a problem involving optimization of a multivariable function. It intuitively reminds me of problems where you take derivatives to find critical points and then determine maxima or minima. Another idea that pops into mind is to possibly use symmetry or some form of substitution to simplify it. But I need to explore further before deciding on an approach.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Denominator\nThe denominator, \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\), is never zero because \\(x^4 + y^4\\) is always non-negative, making the smallest value of the denominator 6. This realization is reassuring because it means the expression is defined for all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and we don't have to worry about division by zero.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying or Substituting?\nTo gain more insight on how to handle the expression, let's see if there's any simple substitution that could help. An obvious (but maybe naive) attempt is to try when \\(x = y\\), which yields zero for the entire expression because \\(x - y = 0\\). This confirms zero is at least a feasible value, though it's likely not the maximum. \n\nLet's try \\(x = -y\\). Then the expression becomes \\(\\frac{2x}{2x^4 + 6}\\). The denominator simplifies to \\(2(x^4 + 3)\\). The new function is \\(\\frac{2x}{2(x^4 + 3)} = \\frac{x}{x^4 + 3}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Function \\(\\frac{x}{x^4 + 3}\\)\nOkay, let's focus on this function. It feels like a calculus problem where we find the critical points. \n\n#### Take Derivative\n- \\(f(x) = \\frac{x}{x^4 + 3}\\)\n\nUse the quotient rule:\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{(x^4 + 3) \\cdot 1 - x \\cdot 4x^3}{(x^4 + 3)^2} = \\frac{x^4 + 3 - 4x^4}{(x^4 + 3)^2} = \\frac{-3x^4 + 3}{(x^4 + 3)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the derivative:\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{3(1 - x^4)}{(x^4 + 3)^2}\n\\]\n\n#### Critical Points\n- Set \\(f'(x) = 0\\):\n  \\[\n  1 - x^4 = 0 \\implies x^4 = 1 \\implies x = \\pm 1\n  \\]\n\n- Check these critical points and the behavior as \\(x \\to \\pm \\infty\\).\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate and Reflect\n- **At \\(x = 1\\) or \\(x = -1\\):**\n  \\[\n  f(1) = \\frac{1}{1^4 + 3} = \\frac{1}{4}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  f(-1) = \\frac{-1}{1^4 + 3} = \\frac{-1}{4}\n  \\]\n\nBoth have the same magnitude, but different signs.\n\n- **As \\(x \\to \\pm \\infty\\):** The expression \\(\\frac{x}{x^4 + 3}\\) tends to 0 because the denominator grows much faster than the numerator.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion and Verification\nThe maximum value of \\(\\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\), obtained via symmetry and calculus, is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) when \\(x = 1, y = -1\\) (or vice versa since \\((x, y)\\) can be interchanged).\n\nReflecting again, it seems we've covered various strategies (substitution, calculus) and re-evaluated the core expression critically. Everything checks out logically, making \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) a convincing maximum value.\n\nThis was a lovely journey through algebraic manipulation, calculus, and checking different conditions to maximize our expression!",

Let $z = -y,$ so $z$ is positive, and $y = -z.$  Then\n\\[\\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6} = \\frac{x + z}{x^4 + z^4 + 6}.\\]By AM-GM,\n\\[x^4 + 1 + 1 + 1 \\ge 4 \\sqrt[4]{x^4} = 4x,\\]and\n\\[z^4 + 1 + 1 + 1 \\ge 4 \\sqrt[4]{z^4} = 4z.\\]Then $x^4 + z^4 + 6 \\ge 4(x + z),$ which implies\n\\[\\frac{x + z}{x^4 + z^4 + 6} \\le \\frac{1}{4}.\\]Equality occurs when $x = z = 1,$ so the maximum value is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}.$"
