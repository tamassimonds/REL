    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into simplifying the expression \\(\\sqrt{41 + 24\\sqrt{2}}\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst impressions: This looks like a nested radical, a square root of a non-integer expression which contains another square root. There might be a way to express it in a simpler form, perhaps as \\((a + b\\sqrt{2})\\), since \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) suggests there might be a rational component and a \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) component in the answer. \n\n### Step 2: Explore Possible Strategies\nI've seen problems like this before where you aim to express a radical expression as a binomial containing another square root. The form \\((a + b\\sqrt{2})\\) is common, especially given the presence of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) in the expression. Let's start by assuming:\n\\[ (a + b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 41 + 24\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Expand and Equate\nNow, let's expand \\((a + b\\sqrt{2})^2\\):\n\\[\n(a + b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2} + 2b^2\n\\]\n\nEquating it to \\(41 + 24\\sqrt{2}\\), we separate it into parts:\n- Pure integer part: \\(a^2 + 2b^2 = 41\\)\n- Coefficient of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\): \\(2ab = 24\\)\n\n### Step 4: Solve the System of Equations\nI'll deal with the equation \\(2ab = 24\\) first:\n\\[ ab = 12 \\]\n\nNow use the integers equation:\n\\[ a^2 + 2b^2 = 41 \\]\n\nHere we have two equations:\n1. \\( ab = 12 \\)\n2. \\( a^2 + 2b^2 = 41 \\)\n\n### Step 5: Solving for Integer Values\nLet's try integer values:\n- Assume \\(a = 4\\), then \\(b = \\frac{12}{4} = 3\\)\n  - Check: \\(a^2 + 2b^2 = 4^2 + 2 \\times 3^2 = 16 + 18 = 34\\) which doesn't work.\n  \nNope, that doesn't seem right. Let me rethink my assumptions.\n\n### Attempting New Values after Reflection\nIt seems I should correct the assumption. Let\u2019s backtrack and try new values:\n- Try \\(a = 6\\), then \\(b = \\frac{12}{6} = 2\\)\n  - Check: \\(a^2 + 2b^2 = 6^2 + 2 \\times 2^2 = 36 + 8 = 44\\) still not correct.\n\nOkay, those aren't quite right. Time to try another approach...\n\n### Step 6: Systematic Integers Test\nRe-focus with more potential pairs for \\( (a, b) \\):\n\n- \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = \\frac{12}{5}\\) isn't integer \u2014no good.\n- \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\\)\n  - Check: \\(a^2 + 2b^2 = 3^2 + 2 \\times 4^2 = 9 + 32 = 41\\) works!\n- Effort pays off here; \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 4\\) satisfy both equations.\n\n### Step 7: Verify and Finalize\nDouble-check:\n- \\(ab = 12\\) and \\(a^2 + 2b^2 = 41\\). Both hold when \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 4\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nFinally, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[ \\sqrt{41 + 24\\sqrt{2}} = 3 + 4\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nYay! This feels right and matches all checks. That was fun\u2014especially when it all clicked together!",

  "ground_truth": "We look for integers $a$ and $b$ such that \\[\\sqrt{41+24\\sqrt2} = a+b\\sqrt2.\\]Squaring both sides, we have $41+24\\sqrt2=(a+b\\sqrt2)^2 = (a^2+2b^2) + 2ab\\sqrt2.$ Therefore, we must have \\[\\begin{aligned} a^2+2b^2 &=41, \\\\ 2ab &= 24. \\end{aligned}\\]The second equation gives $ab=12.$ Trying the factor pairs of $12,$ we find that $(a,b)=(3,4)$ satisfies $a^2+2b^2=41.$ Therefore, $41+24\\sqrt2=(3+4\\sqrt2)^2.$ Since $3+4\\sqrt2 \\ge 0,$ it follows that \\[\\sqrt{41+24\\sqrt2} = \\boxed{3+4\\sqrt2}.\\]"
