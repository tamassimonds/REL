    "working_out": "First, let's really understand what the problem is asking us. We have a triangle with side lengths \\( AB = 6 \\), \\( BC = 8 \\), and \\( CA = 10 \\). This actually strikes me as a right triangle, but I'll confirm it before making any assumptions, just to be safe. These side lengths somewhat remind me of Pythagorean triples, which could be a clue, but I need to verify it first.\n\nHmm, let's see. Could this be a right triangle? If it is, then one angle would be 90 degrees. Calculating using the Pythagorean theorem: \n- Check if \\( AB^2 + BC^2 = CA^2 \\):\n  \\[ 6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2 \\]\n  \\[ 36 + 64 = 100 \\]\n  \nYes! That adds up correctly. \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is indeed a right triangle with the right angle at \\( B \\). This might simplify things a bit.\n\nNow, onto the main problem: finding the length of the angle bisector \\( AD \\). Since \\( AD \\) is an angle bisector of angle \\( A \\), and \\( D \\) lies on \\( BC \\), we can make use of the Angle Bisector Theorem. This theorem says that \\( \\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC} \\).\n\nLet's apply it:\n\n- We know \\( \\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n\nThis means \\( BD:DC = 3:5 \\). Since \\( BC = 8 \\), this ratio translates to:\n- Let \\( BD = 3x \\) and \\( DC = 5x \\).\n- So, \\( 3x + 5x = 8 \\).\n- Solving for \\( x \\), we get \\( 8x = 8 \\) which means \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nThus, \\( BD = 3 \\) and \\( DC = 5 \\).\n\nNow, I know the segments \\( BD \\) and \\( DC \\), and I need to find the length \\( AD \\). \n\nThe formula for an angle bisector in a triangle is: \n\n\\[\nAD^2 = AB \\cdot AC - BD \\cdot DC\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n\\[\nAD^2 = 6 \\cdot 10 - 3 \\cdot 5\n\\]\n\\[\nAD^2 = 60 - 15\n\\]\n\\[\nAD^2 = 45\n\\]\n\nAfter calculating, it looks like \\( AD^2 = 45 \\).\n\nQuickly double-check the computations:\n- Check \\( 6 \\times 10 \\): 60\n- Check \\( 3 \\times 5 \\): 15\n- Difference \\( 60 - 15 \\): 45\n\nEverything checks out correctly. The math and logic both align with what I'm expecting. \n\nThe value of \\( AD^2 \\) is \\( 45 \\).",

That means $DB:DC:BC = 6:10:16,$ since $BC = DB + DC.$ So $DB = \\frac{6}{16} \\cdot BC = 3.$\n\nFinally, we have that $AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2 = 6^2 + 3^2 = 36 + 9 = \\boxed{45}.$"
