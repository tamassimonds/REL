    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem step by step. I'm going to approach this like I would if I were working it out on paper, with all my thoughts, checks, and reflections.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nThe question states that the average of five weights is 13 grams. That feels like a clue to find the total weight of those five items. I guess I should start there. But wait, the average will change once the sixth weight is added. Okay, I mentally note that I need a strategy that considers this new information. Let's start with the information we know and build from there.\n\n**Step 1: Understand What Average Means**\n\nAn average is computed by dividing the sum of the values by the number of values. For five weights that average to 13 grams, here's what pops into my head:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Total sum of weights}}{\\text{Number of weights}} \\]\n\nSeems like I can find the total sum of those five weights by rearranging this formula.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total of the Initial Five Weights**\n\nGiven:\n- Average of the five weights = 13 grams\n- Number of weights = 5\n\nUsing the formula for average:\n\\[ \\text{Total sum of weights} = \\text{Average} \\times \\text{Number of weights} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total sum of weights} = 13 \\times 5 = 65 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\nThis tells me that the total mass of these five weights combined is 65 grams.\n\n**Check-in:**\n\nThis makes sense so far. The total of 65 grams divided by 5 does indeed get me back to the average of 13 grams. I'm on track.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the Addition of the Sixth Weight**\n\nThere's a new weight added which weighs 7 grams. I should now consider this new total:\n\n\\[ \\text{New total mass} = 65 + 7 = 72 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the New Average**\n\nNow, with six weights, I need to determine a new average:\n\\[ \\text{New average} = \\frac{\\text{New total mass}}{\\text{Number of weights}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{New average} = \\frac{72}{6} \\]\n\nHere, dividing 72 by 6 is a basic arithmetic operation:\n\n\\[ 72 \\div 6 = 12 \\]\n\n**Conclusion and Checks:**\n\nSo, it looks like the new average weight is 12 grams when including the sixth weight. I should double-check:\n\n\\- Thinking about it, does 12 grams make sense with the new weight added? Well, the average decreased because the added weight (7 grams) is below the previous average (13 grams). \n\n\\- Okay, seems logical and the math checks out. The answer is indeed 12 grams.\n\nThis step-by-step breakdown should suffice! Through this process, all the pieces fit correctly, and my approach maintains continuity toward solving the problem.",

  "ground_truth": "The average of the five weights is 13 gm. Then the total weight of the five weights is $5\\times13$ or 65 gm. The sixth weight increases the total to 72 gm. The average of the six weights is $\\frac{72}{6}$ or $\\boxed{12 \\text{ gm}}$."
