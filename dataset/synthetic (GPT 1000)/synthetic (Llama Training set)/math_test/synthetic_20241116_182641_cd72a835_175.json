    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem by breaking it down step-by-step while thinking through it as naturally as possible.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nThe equation given is \\(2^{x + 2} = 32\\). Our task is to find the integer value of \\(x\\) that satisfies this equation.\n\nFirst thoughts:\n\n- \"This equation involves an exponent with base 2. I know 32 is also a power of 2. Maybe I can express 32 as a power of 2.\"\n- It's also struck me that simple adjustments to \\(x + 2\\) using suitable powers of two should get me somewhere close.\n\n**Step 2: Explore Potential Methods**\n\nI could:\n\n- Try to express 32 as a power of 2 since both sides involve base 2.\n- Use properties of exponents to simplify the problem.\n- Consider solving it directly by manipulating the exponent.\n\nLet me start by examining if I can express 32 as some power of 2. \n\n**Step 3: Express 32 as a Power of 2**\n\nRight, let\u2019s think:\n\n- I know: \\(2^1 = 2\\), \\(2^2 = 4\\), \\(2^3 = 8\\), \\(2^4 = 16\\), and \\(2^5 = 32\\).\n- \"Aha! So, 32 is \\(2^5\\). That\u2019s a good start.\"\n\nThis means I can rewrite the original equation \\(2^{x + 2} = 32\\) as:\n\n\\[ 2^{x + 2} = 2^5 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Use Properties of Exponents**\n\nNow, because the bases are the same, I can equate the exponents. \n\n- Equating them gives \\(x + 2 = 5\\).\n\n**Step 5: Solve for \\(x\\)**\n\nI can solve for \\(x\\) now:\n\n\\[ x + 2 = 5 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 5 - 2 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 3 \\]\n\n**Step 6: Verify the Result**\n\nLet\u2019s plug \\(x = 3\\) back into the original equation to see if it satisfies it:\n\n\\[ 2^{x + 2} = 2^{3 + 2} = 2^5 = 32 \\]\n\n- \"Yes, it works! The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \\(x = 3\\) is correct.\"\n\n**Reflection and Final Thoughts**\n\n- \"This approach of expressing both sides as powers of the same base worked nicely. By equating the exponents, I could solve it directly.\"\n- \"Looking back, expressing numbers as powers of the same base was a straightforward way to solve the problem without unnecessary calculations.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe integer \\(x\\) that satisfies the equation \\(2^{x+2} = 32\\) is \\(x = 3\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Two raised to the 5th power equals 32, and since the function $f(x)=2^x$ is monotonically increasing, 5 is the only real number $r$ for which $2^r=32$.  Therefore, $x+2=5\\implies x=\\boxed{3}$."
