It states:\n- I need to find \\( A \\), which is the sum of the positive divisors of 500.\n- After finding \\( A \\), I then need to determine the sum of its distinct prime divisors.\n\nAlright, this looks familiar. It involves finding divisors, which usually requires understanding the prime factorization of a number. Finding the sum of divisors can be done using a neat formula when we have the prime factorization. Let's sketch out a plan.\n\n### Step 2: Prime Factorization of 500\n\nHmm, let's break down 500 into its prime factors:\n- 500 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 500 \\div 2 = 250 \\).\n- 250 is also even, divide again by 2: \\( 250 \\div 2 = 125 \\).\n\nNow for 125:\n- Divide by 5 (it ends in 5): \\( 125 \\div 5 = 25 \\).\n- Divide by 5 again: \\( 25 \\div 5 = 5 \\).\n- Finally, divide by 5: \\( 5 \\div 5 = 1 \\).\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 500 is \\( 2^2 \\times 5^3 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Formula for Sum of Divisors\n\nAh, I remember there's a formula for finding the sum of divisors using the prime factorization:\n\\[\n\\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\ldots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + \\ldots + p_2^{k_2})\\ldots\n\\]\nFor \\( 500 = 2^2 \\times 5^3 \\), the sum of the divisors is:\n\\[\n(1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 5 + 25 + 125)\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculating Sum of Divisors\n\nLet's calculate those components:\n- \\( 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \\)\n- \\( 1 + 5 + 25 + 125 = 156 \\)\n\nNow, multiply these sums:\n\\[\n7 \\times 156\n\\]\n\nLet's multiply to find \\( A \\):\n- \\( 7 \\times 156 = 7 \\times (150 + 6) = 7 \\times 150 + 7 \\times 6 \\)\n- \\( 7 \\times 150 = 1050 \\)\n- \\( 7 \\times 6 = 42 \\)\n- Adding those results gives \\( 1050 + 42 = 1092 \\)\n\nSo, \\( A = 1092 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Prime Divisors of \\( A \\)\n\nOkay, now I need to determine the prime divisors of 1092.\nLet's factor it:\n- 1092 is even, divide by 2: \\( 1092 \\div 2 = 546 \\).\n- 546 is even, divide by 2 again: \\( 546 \\div 2 = 273 \\).\n\nNow, check 273:\n- It's not divisible by 2 (odd), try 3 (sum of digits \\(2+7+3 = 12\\), divisible by 3): \\( 273 \\div 3 = 91 \\).\n\nCheck 91:\n- It's not divisible by 2, 3, 5, but 7 (since \\(91 \\div 7 = 13\\)).\n\nNow, 13 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime divisors of 1092 are \\( 2, 3, 7, \\) and \\( 13 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Sum the Distinct Prime Divisors\n\nAdd up these prime numbers:\n\\[\n2 + 3 + 7 + 13 = 25\n\\]\n\n### Checking Over\n\nI believe everything checks out, but let me think through it one more time lightly:\n- Prime factorization steps feel correct.\n- Used the formula for sum of divisors accurately.\n- Prime factorization of the sum was straightforward.\n\nOkay, that all looks thorough, so the final answer is:\n\nThe sum of the distinct prime divisors of \\( A \\) is **25**.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we find $A$. The prime factorization of $500$ is $2^2 \\cdot 5^3$. Therefore,  $$A=(1+2+2^2)(1+5+5^2+5^3)=(7)(156).$$To see why $(1+2+2^2)(1+5+5^2+5^3)$ equals the sum of the divisors of 500, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 12 terms, with each divisor of $2^2\\cdot 5^3$ appearing exactly once.\n\nNow we prime factorize $7 \\cdot 156 = 7 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 13$. The sum of the prime divisors of $A$ is $2+3+7+13=\\boxed{25}$."
