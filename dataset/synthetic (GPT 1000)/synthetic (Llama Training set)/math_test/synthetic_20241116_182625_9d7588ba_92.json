My initial thought is that this has something to do with similar triangles given the identical shape and parallel bases.\n- **What does parallel bases imply?** Parallel bases in triangles suggest they might be similar since all corresponding angles will be the same.\n- **Goal:** We need the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the larger triangle.\n\n#### Exploring Strategies\n- **Strategy 1: Check Properties of Similar Triangles**\n  - **Fact:** If two triangles are similar, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.\n  - Corresponding side length ratio: Smaller triangle base / Larger triangle base = 4 cm / 10 cm = \\( \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n  - **Validating similarity assumption:** The bases are parallel, which implies the corresponding sides are proportional, verifying the triangles are similar.\n\n- **Strategy 2: Calculate Areas Directly (for verification)**\n  - Assuming heights are proportional to their bases due to similarity:\n    - Let height of the smaller triangle be \\( h \\).\n    - Then height of larger triangle is \\( \\frac{5}{2}h \\) since side (base) ratio is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n  - **Smaller triangle area:** \n    \\[\n    \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times h = 2h\n    \\]\n  - **Larger triangle area:** \n    \\[\n    \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times \\frac{5}{2}h = \\frac{25}{2}h\n    \\]\n\n#### Checking and Reflecting\n- **Ratio of Areas:**\n  - Using the property of similar triangles: \\((\\frac{2}{5})^2 = \\frac{4}{25}\\).\n  - Calculating directly: \n    \\[\n    \\frac{2h}{\\frac{25}{2}h} = \\frac{2h \\times 2}{25h} = \\frac{4}{25}\n    \\]\n\n#### Finalizing the Answer\n- Both methods agree: The ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the larger triangle is \\(\\frac{4}{25}\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nUltimately, the realization about the similarity of triangles due to parallel bases led to understanding the problem correctly. I explored both theoretical understanding and concrete calculation for confirmation. The answer is \\(\\frac{4}{25}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Because of our parallel bases, we can see that corresponding angles of the triangles must be congruent. Therefore, by AA similarity, we see that the two triangles are similar.\n\nIf two similar triangles have side ratios of $r : 1,$ the ratio of their areas must be $r^2 : 1.$ In our diagram, we see that the ratio of the sides of the smaller triangle to the sides of the larger triangle is $\\dfrac{4\\text{ cm}}{10\\text{ cm}} = \\dfrac{2}{5}.$ Therefore, the ratio of the areas is the square of that, or $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{25}}.$"
