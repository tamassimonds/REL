Additionally, four times the smaller number is 60 less than twice the larger number.\n\n2. **What Do We Need to Find?**: The larger number.\n\n3. **Possible Approaches**: There are several methods I can use, like:\n   - Setting up a system of equations.\n   - Trying substitution and elimination.\n   - Using logic based on what we know about number properties.\n\n### Approach 1: System of Equations\n\n**Step 1**: Let's use algebra by setting up equations. \n\n- Assign variables:\n  - Let \\( x \\) be the smaller number.\n  - Let \\( y \\) be the larger number.\n\n**Step 2**: Translate conditions into equations.\n\n- Condition 1: The sum of the two numbers is 15.\n  \\[\n  x + y = 15\n  \\]\n\n- Condition 2: Four times the smaller number is 60 less than twice the larger number.\n  \\[\n  4x = 2y - 60\n  \\]\n\n**Reflect**: Are these equations set up correctly? Yes, they seem to translate the word problem accurately.\n\n### Solving the System\n\n**Step 1**: Let's simplify the second equation to make it easier to work with.\n\n- Rearrange the equation:\n  \\[\n  4x = 2y - 60\n  \\]\n  Simplifying gives:\n  \\[\n  2y = 4x + 60\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2**: Solve for one of the variables. Let's solve the first equation for \\( y \\):\n  \\[\n  y = 15 - x\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3**: Substitute into the simplified second equation:\n  \\[\n  2(15 - x) = 4x + 60\n  \\]\n\n**Doing the Math**:\n\\[\n30 - 2x = 4x + 60\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\(30\\) from both sides:\n\\[\n-2x = 4x + 30\n\\]\n\nAdd \\(2x\\) to both sides:\n\\[\n0 = 6x + 30\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\(30\\) from both sides:\n\\[\n-30 = 6x\n\\]\n\nDivide by \\(6\\):\n\\[\nx = -5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: Wait a second! That doesn't seem right. The smaller number should be positive. I must have made an arithmetic mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\n### Checking the Math\n\nOn the equation \\(2(15 - x) = 4x + 60\\), this should have been expanded correctly. Let's go through it again slowly:\n\nRe-expand and simplify:\n\\[ \n2 \\times 15 - 2x = 4x + 60 \n\\]\nThis should be:\n\\[\n30 - 2x = 4x + 60\n\\]\n\nRearrange:\n\\[\n30 - 60 = 6x + 2x \n\\]\n\nAdjust:\n\\[\n-30 = 6x + 2x \n\\]\n\nNow it seems correct. My variable setup maybe have been flawed.\n\n### Approach 2: Another Attempt\n\n**Let's try solving step-by-step again for clarity**:\n\n\\[\n30 = 2y + 4x \n\\]\n\nRe-simplify:\n\\[\n30 - 4x = 2y\n\\]\n\nConvert to:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{30 - 4x}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter adjustment, given \\(x = 15 - y\\), substitute to check if normal calculations fail meaning something is fundamentally wrong. \n\nThe approach seemed incorrect from the second calculation, likely carried original miss-equations from first calculation:\n\nCheck again solving step setup. Rework and solve correctly for accuracy as arithmetic missteps are leading to wrong reflection currently.\n\nFinally, resizing the math through arithmetic checks showed obtained faulty x checking basic assumptions wrong implicitly. Grafting proper solutions fundamental here. Further formula reflective failures mean mistakes in initial steps likely, built upon premise incorrect assumptions throughout.\n\nReturning to original assumptions anew to derive naturally concluded arithmetic sequence fits: \"Another cull riddle reflects model repetitions same mistake likely fundamental.\"\n\nLet's pause and correct assumptions again and potentially reshape model to form valid construct conclusively balanced. Corrections vital.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculations. Let's start fresh and resolve the problem systematically.\n\n### Rethink and Reassess\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Again**:  \n   - We have two numbers whose sum is 15.\n   - Four times the smaller number is 60 less than twice the larger number.\n   - We need to find the larger number.\n\n2. **Approach**: Let's use a system of equations again, but more carefully this time.\n\n### Setting Up the Equations Correctly\n\n- Assign variables:\n  - Let \\( x \\) be the smaller number.\n  - Let \\( y \\) be the larger number.\n\nEquations based on the conditions:\n\n- **Equation 1**: \\( x + y = 15 \\)\n- **Equation 2**: \\( 4x = 2y - 60 \\)\n\n### Solving the System\n\nWe already have Equation 1:  \n\\[ x + y = 15 \\]  \nFrom which, we can express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\):  \n\\[ x = 15 - y \\]  \n\n#### Substituting into Equation 2:\n\nReplace \\( x \\) in Equation 2:  \n\\[ 4(15 - y) = 2y - 60 \\]  \n\nNow, simplify:  \n\\[ 60 - 4y = 2y - 60 \\]  \n\nAdd \\( 4y \\) and \\( 60 \\) to both sides:  \n\\[ 120 = 6y \\]  \n\nDivide both sides by 6:  \n\\[ y = 20 \\]  \n\n### Conclusion and Verification\n\nThus, the larger number \\( y \\) is 20. To verify, let's find \\( x \\) using \\( x = 15 - y \\):  \n\\[ x = 15 - 20 = -5 \\]  \n\nChecking the conditions:  \n- \\( x + y = -5 + 20 = 15 \\), which holds true.\n- \\( 4x = 4(-5) = -20 \\) and \\( 2y - 60 = 2(20) - 60 = 40 - 60 = -20 \\), which holds true.\n\nEverything checks out correctly now! The larger number is \\( \\boxed{20} \\). This resolves the problem accurately, aligning my solution with the conditions given in the problem statement.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $y$ be the larger of the numbers.  Since the numbers sum to 15, the other number is $15-y$.   Since four times the smaller number is 60 less than twice the larger, we have: \\begin{align*}\n4(15-y)&=2y-60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n60-4y&=2y-60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n120&=6y\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20&=y.\n\\end{align*} The larger number is $\\boxed{20}$, which makes the smaller number -5. We can check that our answer is correct by plugging the values into the original problem. We get $-5+20=15$ and $4(-5)=2(20)-60$, which result in $15=15$ and $-20=-20$."
