    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nThe problem involves finding the degree of the product of two polynomials. If \\( p(t) \\) and \\( q(t) \\) are both seventh-degree polynomials, I'm inclined to think about how polynomial multiplication works. I've encountered something similar before - where multiplying polynomials results in combining their degrees, but I need to ensure this applies here.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Thinking About Degrees:**\n\n   - When multiplying polynomials, the degree of the product is generally the sum of the degrees of the factors. I recall the reason being that the highest-degree terms in each polynomial will combine to form the highest-degree term in the product.\n   - In this case, since each polynomial is of degree 7, the individual highest-degree term would be \\( t^7 \\).\n   - Thus, when multiplied, the highest-degree term should be \\( t^{7 + 7} = t^{14} \\).\n\n2. **Checking Definitions:**\n\n   - A polynomial of degree 7 would be written in the general form as: \\( p(t) = a_7t^7 + a_6t^6 + \\ldots + a_0 \\), where \\( a_7 \\neq 0 \\).\n   - Similarly, \\( q(t) = b_7t^7 + b_6t^6 + \\ldots + b_0 \\), where \\( b_7 \\neq 0 \\).\n\n3. **Multiplying the Leading Terms:**\n\n   - Focusing on the highest-degree terms: \\( a_7t^7 \\) from \\( p(t) \\) and \\( b_7t^7 \\) from \\( q(t) \\).\n   - Their product \\( a_7b_7t^{14} \\) indicates the degree of the resulting polynomial should indeed be 14, assuming \\( a_7 \\) and \\( b_7 \\) are both not zero, maintaining the non-zero leading coefficient.\n\n4. **Possible Pitfalls to Check:**\n\n   - Ensure that there's no cancellation of terms to reduce the degree in some special cases. Here, because \\( a_7 \\) and \\( b_7 \\) are non-zero, such cancellations that would lower the overall degree won't occur.\n\n**Reflecting on the Solution:**\n\n- My initial understanding seems correct. The degree of the product looks like it will be 14.\n- Double-checking: Let's see if there's any reason multiplying lower-degree terms could contradict this assumption. Given we're considering non-zero coefficients and each polynomial independently, no lower degree can affect this ultimate degree\u2014unless \\( a_7 \\) or \\( b_7 \\) were zero, but that's not allowed here by the polynomial definition.\n\n**Concluding:**\n\nSo, after exploring different angles and ensuring there are no obvious misunderstandings or oversights:\n\nThe degree of the product \\( p(t) \\cdot q(t) \\) is \\( 14 \\).",
