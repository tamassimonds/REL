    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nThe problem involves a sequence where each term after the first is the sum of all preceding terms. Immediately, this suggests a recursive or cumulative structure to the sequence. The sequence looks similar to a sequence that builds by summing all previous numbers which might be related to powers of 2 due to the exponential nature of such growth. However, let's not get ahead of ourselves and begin by defining and investigating the sequence.\n\n### Exploration\n\n1. **Think about the Sequence Definition**:\n    - We know: \\( a_i = a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{i-1} \\) for \\( i \\ge 2 \\).\n    - This seems like the sequence grows quite quickly because with each step, you're adding up all previous steps.\n\n2. **Start with a Small Example**:\n    - Set \\( a_1 = x \\) as our initial term. Then:\n        - \\( a_2 = a_1 = x \\)\n        - \\( a_3 = a_1 + a_2 = x + x = 2x \\)\n        - \\( a_4 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = x + x + 2x = 4x \\)\n        - \\( a_5 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = x + x + 2x + 4x = 8x \\)\n\n    This looks like each subsequent term is a doubling of all previous terms. This suggests that the sequence \\( \\{a_n\\} \\) might relate to powers of two scales by some base factor \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Identify the Pattern**:\n    - Reflecting on the simple sequence gives us the pattern: \\( a_n = 2^{n-2}a_2 \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\). \n    - Let's see if this relationship holds with our sequence assumption starting from \\( a_2 = x \\):\n        - \\( a_2 = x = 2^0 \\cdot x \\)\n        - \\( a_3 = 2x = 2^1 \\cdot x \\)\n        - \\( a_4 = 4x = 2^2 \\cdot x \\)\n        - \\( a_5 = 8x = 2^3 \\cdot x \\)\n      \n4. **Generalize the Formula**:\n    - So, \\( a_n = 2^{n-2} \\cdot a_2 \\) holds. We've identified the recursive nature.\n\n### Integration with Given Data\n\n1. **Use Known Value**:\n    - It is given that \\( a_{19} = 99 \\).\n    - From the pattern: \\( a_{19} = 2^{17} \\cdot a_2 = 99 \\).\n\n2. **Solve for \\( a_2 \\)**:\n    - Compute \\( a_2 \\) from the formula:\n    \\[\n    a_2 = \\frac{99}{2^{17}}\n    \\]\n\n3. **Find \\( a_{20} \\)**:\n    - Use the general formula to find \\( a_{20} \\):\n    \\[\n    a_{20} = 2^{18} \\cdot a_2 = 2^{18} \\left(\\frac{99}{2^{17}} \\right) = 2 \\cdot 99 = 198\n    \\]\n\n    The \\( a_{20} \\) is thus \\( 198 \\).\n\n### Reflection and Checks\n\n- The approach inherently feels correct because of the pattern recognition and application to the recursive series structures.\n- Though initially the assumptions might've seemed imposing, it aligns with exponential growth verified from simple computation.\n- This makes sense because each step doubles the series from the previous set.\n- Calculations seem solid and each derived step followed the expected logical progressions.\n\nFinally, I feel confident that the calculations verify that \\( a_{20} = 198 \\) as the correct answer.",
