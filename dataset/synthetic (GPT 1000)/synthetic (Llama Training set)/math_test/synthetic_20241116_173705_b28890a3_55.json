    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem step by step. First, let's try to fully understand what's being asked here.\n\n### Understanding the Problem:\nWe need to find two consecutive integers between which the sum \\(\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50}\\) lies. This means we're looking to approximate this sum and determine the whole numbers that bound it on a number line.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\nThe problem involves square roots, which reminds me that I'll need to approximate square roots to decimals. The key is to estimate these values accurately enough to determine the boundaries on the number line.\n\n#### Strategy:\n1. Approximate \\(\\sqrt{30}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{50}\\) separately.\n2. Add these approximate values.\n3. Identify the integers between which the sum lies.\n\n### Step 1: Approximating \\(\\sqrt{30}\\)\n\n- I know that \\(5^2 = 25\\) and \\(6^2 = 36\\). So, \\(\\sqrt{30}\\) is somewhere between 5 and 6.\n- Let's refine this further. If I calculate the midpoint \\(5.5\\), \\(5.5^2 = 30.25\\). This is slightly more than 30.\n- Try \\(5.4\\): \\(5.4^2 = 29.16\\), which is less than 30.\n- Try \\(5.48\\): \\(5.48^2 = 30.0704\\). Okay, this is very close.\n- So, \\(\\sqrt{30}\\) is approximately 5.48.\n\n### Check:\n- Is this close enough for our purposes? Yes, it gives me a reasonable estimate.\n\n### Step 2: Approximating \\(\\sqrt{50}\\)\n\n- \\(7^2 = 49\\) and \\(8^2 = 64\\), so \\(\\sqrt{50}\\) is between 7 and 8.\n- Again, check \\(7.1\\): \\(7.1^2 = 50.41\\), a bit too high.\n- Try \\(7.05\\): \\(7.05^2 = 49.7025\\), nearly there.\n- So, \\(\\sqrt{50}\\) is approximately 7.07.\n\n### Check:\n- Both approximations seem reasonable. I'll use these to determine the sum.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Sum\n\n- \\(\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50} \\approx 5.48 + 7.07 = 12.55\\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Consecutive Integers\n\n- We want to see between which two integers this sum, 12.55, falls.\n- Clearly, \\(12 < 12.55 < 13\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe sum \\(\\sqrt{30} + \\sqrt{50}\\) is between the integers 12 and 13. \n\n### Final Check:\n- \\(5.48^2 + 7.07^2\\):\n  - We've been consistent in our approximations, reflecting typical values you'd see and sufficient for finding integers.\n- **Answer**: 12 and 13\n\nThe reasoning seems sound, and my calculations back it up. I'm confident the sum of these two square roots does indeed occupy the space between 12 and 13 on the number line.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $25<30<36$, we have $5<\\sqrt{30}<6$. We also know that $7^2=49$, so $\\sqrt{50}\\approx7$. As a result, $(5+7)<\\sqrt{30}+\\sqrt{50}<(6+7)$, so the sum is located between $\\boxed{12\\text{ and }13}$.\n\nTo be more precise, $\\sqrt{50}>7$, but we're still able to say that $\\sqrt{30}+\\sqrt{50}<(6+7)$ when we add a slightly greater quantity to the left side since the difference between $6$ and $\\sqrt{30}$ is much greater than the difference between $\\sqrt{50}$ and $7$."
