    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem one step at a time. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirstly, I'm gathering that we have a geometric problem involving angles and potentially a line that we might need to use some geometric principles on, such as straight line relations or angle properties. \n\nGiven that line \\( l \\) is a straight line, and we have an angle labeled \\( x \\) and another angle labeled \\( x+20^\\circ \\), these are likely angles that are adjacent to each other on this straight line. My initial thought is that this is reminiscent of angle properties on a straight line.\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorming Different Strategies\n\nThe problem mentions a \"straight line,\" which usually denotes that the sum of angles on one side of that line equals \\( 180^\\circ \\). So, my plan is to:\n1. Assume that the angles \\( x \\) and \\( x + 20^\\circ \\) are adjacent on the line \\( l \\).\n2. Calculate the sum of these angles and equate them to \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n\nAre there any alternate approaches? I could try considering other geometric theorems, such as the exterior angle theorem or parallel line properties, but without additional context or figures, these might be less applicable. For now, sticking with straight line properties seems the simplest.\n\n### Step 3: Setting up the Equation\n\nLooking at line \\( l \\), if we consider angles \\( x \\) and \\( x + 20^\\circ \\) to be on this line, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ \nx + (x + 20^\\circ) = 180^\\circ \n\\]\n\nLooks straightforward. Let's solve it.\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Equation\n\n1. Combine like terms:\n\n    \\[ \n    2x + 20^\\circ = 180^\\circ \n    \\]\n\n2. Subtract \\( 20^\\circ \\) from both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n\n    \\[ \n    2x = 160^\\circ \n    \\]\n\n3. Divide by 2 to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n    \\[ \n    x = 80^\\circ \n    \\]\n\n### Step 5: Checking the Work\n\nTo ensure this answer makes sense, let's verify quickly:\n- We initially assumed the sum of \\( x \\) and \\( x + 20^\\circ \\) should be \\( 180^\\circ \\) because they are adjacent angles on a straight line.\n- Substituting \\( x = 80^\\circ \\), we find that \\( 80^\\circ + 100^\\circ = 180^\\circ \\), which checks out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe value of \\( x \\) in the problem is \\( 80^\\circ \\). This solution comes from applying basic geometry, specifically the concept that angles on a straight line sum to \\( 180^\\circ \\). That approach worked smoothly, and the math confirmed it.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the two angles together form a line, we have $x+ (x+20^\\circ) = 180^\\circ$.  Simplifying gives $2x + 20^\\circ = 180^\\circ$, so $2x = 160^\\circ$ and $x = \\boxed{80^\\circ}$."
