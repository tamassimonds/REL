    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. \n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\n- Kent won 25% of the games he played on Saturday, which immediately tells me we're dealing with percentages and we need to think of a total number of games.\n- He lost 12 games. There were no ties, so every game he played resulted in either a win or a loss.\n- I need to figure out how many games he won.\n\nInitial thought: Without knowing the total number of games, I\u2019m feeling a bit unsure. But since he won 25% of the games, this means if I can figure out the total, calculating the number of wins should be straightforward.\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm Possible Approaches**\n\n- I could set up an equation involving percentages, like using \"x\" for total games to figure out the total and then calculate wins from there.\n- Another approach could be guessing the number of total games that make sense and see if it aligns with the information given. \n- Right now, I'm leaning toward setting up an equation because it feels more precise.\n\n**Step 3: Set Up an Equation**\n\n- Let's call the total number of games \"T\".\n- Kent won 25% of these games, which is 0.25T.\n- Conversely, he lost 75% of these games (since 100% - 25% = 75%), which is 0.75T.\n\nBut wait, I know he lost exactly 12 games. That seems like a better way to set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 0.75T = 12 \\]\n\nCheck: If T is the total number of games and he lost 75% of them, 0.75T should equal 12. This setup seems correct.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Equation**\n\n- I\u2019ll solve for \\( T \\):\n\n\\[ 0.75T = 12 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 0.75:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{12}{0.75} \\]\n\nQuick math: \n\n- How many times does 0.75 go into 12? Converting it to a more manageable calculation: \\( 12 \\div \\frac{3}{4} \\) is equivalent to \\( 12 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 16 \\).\n- So, \\( T = 16 \\).\n\nDouble check: If the total number of games is 16, and he lost 12 games, which is 75% of 16, this makes sense.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Number of Wins**\n\n- Total games \\( T = 16 \\).\n- The number of games won would be \\( 0.25T \\):\n\n\\[ 0.25 \\times 16 = 4 \\]\n\n**Step 6: Verify**\n\n- Out of 16 games, he won 4 and lost 12.\n- 4/16 converts to 25%, confirming that 25% of the games were indeed wins.\n\nEverything checks out: the calculations make sense given the initial problem's constraints. \n\nFinal thought: Moving through this iteratively allowed me to confirm the total and double-check all steps logically. The answer is that Kent won **4 games**.",

  "ground_truth": "If Kent won $25\\%$ of the games, he lost $75\\%$ of them.  Thus if $g$ is the total number of games he played,\n\n$$12=0.75(g)\\Rightarrow g=16$$\n\nSo the number of games he won was $16-12=\\boxed{4}$."
