    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\nOkay, we have a rectangle where the length is twice the width, and the diagonal is \\(5\\sqrt{5}\\). This feels like it might relate to the Pythagorean theorem because a rectangle's diagonals act like the hypotenuse of two right triangles within the rectangle. The problem reminds me of using relationships between the sides of triangles and their diagonals, which involves thinking about right triangle properties. \n\nPossible strategy brainstorm:\n\n1. Use the Pythagorean theorem, because the diagonal, width, and length form a right triangle.\n2. Let \\(w\\) be the width, then \\(2w\\) is the length.\n3. Reflect: Multiply both width and length by some factor to progress logically.\n\nLet's gather information:\n\n1. Express the relationship: Since the length \\( L = 2w \\) and the width \\( W = w \\).\n2. By the Pythagorean theorem applied to the rectangle, the diagonal \\(d\\) satisfies: \n   \\[\n   d^2 = L^2 + W^2.\n   \\]\n   \nAlright, now substitute in what we know:\n\n1. Substituting \\( L = 2w \\) and \\( W = w \\) into the Pythagorean relation:\n   \\[\n   d^2 = (2w)^2 + w^2.\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculating further:\n   \\[\n   d^2 = 4w^2 + w^2 = 5w^2.\n   \\]\n\nRealize that we know the diagonal:\n\n1. We are given \\( d = 5\\sqrt{5} \\), therefore:\n   \\[\n   (5\\sqrt{5})^2 = 5w^2.\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\( (5\\sqrt{5})^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   25 \\times 5 = 125.\n   \\]\n\n3. So, set the equation:\n   \\[\n   125 = 5w^2.\n   \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( w^2 \\):\n\n1. Dividing both sides by 5:\n   \\[\n   w^2 = 25.\n   \\]\n\n2. Reflect: \\(w^2 = 25\\) which implies the width \\(w\\) could be \\(\\pm 5\\), but since a length can't be negative:\n   - \\(w = 5\\).\n\nCalculate area:\n\n1. Since \\( L = 2w \\), we have \\( L = 10 \\).\n\n2. Now, calculate the area \\( A \\):\n   \\[\n   A = L \\times W = 10 \\times 5 = 50.\n   \\]\n\nDouble-check: Just redo the calculations again briefly to ensure we didn't miss steps or make arithmetic errors:\n\n1. **Given**: Length \\( L = 2w \\), Width \\( W = w \\), diagonal \\( d = 5\\sqrt{5} \\).\n\n2. Initial setup with Pythagorean theorem:\n   \\[\n   (5\\sqrt{5})^2 = 4w^2 + w^2 = 5w^2.\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   125 = 5w^2 \\Rightarrow w^2 = 25 \\Rightarrow w = 5.\n   \\]\n\n3. Length \\( L = 10 \\) and Width \\( W = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Area**: \\( A = L \\times W = 10 \\times 5 = 50. \\)\n\nConclusion: The area of the rectangle is indeed 50 square units, which makes intuitive sense given the problem constraints. Reflecting on similar problems, this approach seems correct, as all calculations line up with the Pythagorean theorem application.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the width of the rectangle be $w$. Then the length of the rectangle is $2w$. We can apply the Pythagorean Theorem to two sides of this rectangle and get that the length of the diagonal is $5\\sqrt{5}=\\sqrt{w^2+(2w)^2}=\\sqrt{5 w^2}$. We therefore have $5\\sqrt{5} = w\\sqrt{5}$, which means that $w=5$. This means that the length of the rectangle is 10, so its area is $5\\cdot10=\\boxed{50}$."
