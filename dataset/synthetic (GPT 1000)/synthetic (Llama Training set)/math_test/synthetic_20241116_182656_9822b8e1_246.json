    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- At first glance, the problem is asking for three-digit integers that satisfy a certain congruence condition. This reminds me of problems involving modular arithmetic I've encountered before. I know that congruence relations can be thought of as establishing an equivalence between numbers based on remainders when divided by a certain number.\n\n- The question of how many positive three-digit integers satisfy this congruence condition is somewhat familiar; it seems we're being asked to count numbers from 100 to 999 that leave the same remainder when divided by 19. This suggests a filtering process based on divisibility by 19. \n\nBrainstorming Different Approaches:\n1. Direct Calculation:\n   - I could compute all three-digit numbers and check each to see if it is congruent to 7 mod 19. That feels inefficient given there are 900 three-digit numbers. \n\n2. Formulaic Pattern:\n   - If I consider the form of numbers that are 7 modulo 19, they have the form `n = 19k + 7`. My task is then to figure out values of `k` such that `n` lies between 100 and 999. \n\n   - To be systematic, I could set up the inequality: \\(100 \\leq 19k + 7 \\leq 999\\).\n\nChecking the Formulaic Pattern Method:\n- Let's solve the inequality for \\(k\\):\n  \n  First solve \\(19k + 7 \\geq 100\\):\n  \\[\n  19k \\geq 100 - 7\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  19k \\geq 93\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  k \\geq \\frac{93}{19}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  k \\geq 4.89\n  \\]\n\n  Since \\(k\\) must be an integer, \\(k \\geq 5\\).\n\n- Now solve \\(19k + 7 \\leq 999\\):\n  \\[\n  19k \\leq 999 - 7\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  19k \\leq 992\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  k \\leq \\frac{992}{19}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  k \\leq 52.21\n  \\]\n\n  Since \\(k\\) must be an integer, \\(k \\leq 52\\).\n\n- So, \\(k\\) ranges from 5 to 52.\n\nReflecting and Counting:\n- The values of \\(k\\) range from 5 to 52 inclusive. \n- Calculating the number of integers: This is simply the count of integers from 5 to 52. We can calculate:\n  \\[\n  52 - 5 + 1 = 48\n  \\]\n\n- Hmm, this answer seems plausible because there aren't that many numbers expressed as \\(19k + 7\\) within the three-digit range when checking some quick calculations. \n\nVerification:\n- To ensure correctness, I'll verify the smallest and largest numbers to confirm they are indeed three-digit integers:\n  - For \\(k = 5\\): \\(n = 19 \\times 5 + 7 = 95 + 7 = 102\\)\n  - For \\(k = 52\\): \\(n = 19 \\times 52 + 7 = 988 + 7 = 995\\)\n  - So both 102 and 995 are three-digit numbers, confirming our calculations.\n\nConclusion:\n- The number of positive three-digit integers congruent to 7 mod 19 is 48. \n\nI've checked my steps, made sure the end conditions have been verified, and everything seems to fall into place, which matches the initial setup conditions correctly for solving this congruence problem. This path has been consistent, efficient, and logically sound.",

  "ground_truth": "An integer congruent to $7 \\pmod{19}$ can be written as $19n+7$. Therefore, we have the inequality $$100 \\le 19n+7 \\le 999.$$We solve for the inequality by subtracting each term by $7$ and then dividing by $19$ to get  $$93\\le 19n \\le 992 \\implies \\frac{93}{19} \\le n \\le \\frac{992}{19}.$$The smallest integer greater than $\\frac{93}{19}$ is $5$ and the largest integer less than $\\frac{992}{19}$ is $52$. There are $52-4=\\boxed{48}$ integers from $5$ to $52$ inclusive."
