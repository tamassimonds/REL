    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem of maximizing \\(\\frac{xy+yz+zx}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\\) under the condition that \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are distinct real numbers with \\(x+y+z=0\\).\n\nFirst thoughts:\n- The expression in the numerator, \\(xy + yz + zx\\), is quite common in problems involving symmetry and can often be related to squared terms, especially since these numbers sum to zero.\n- The denominator, \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\), is simply the sum of the squares of the variables.\n- Since \\(x + y + z = 0\\), this might remind me of problems involving symmetric sums in polynomials or transformations to simplify expressions.\n- To maximize a ratio, sometimes bounding techniques or transformations might help.\n- Another thought is considering possible substitutions or algebraic manipulations like expressing one variable in terms of the others using the condition \\(x + y + z = 0\\).\n\nBrainstorming possible strategies:\n1. **Substitute using the condition**: Substitute \\(z = -(x+y)\\) into the expression to see if it simplifies the problem.\n2. **Symmetry or transformations**: Recognize possible symmetries or try transformations that might reveal a simpler equivalent problem.\n3. **Use inequalities**: Perhaps Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-GM might simplify or bound the expression.\n\nLet's start with the first idea:\n- Substitute \\(z = -(x+y)\\) into both numerator and denominator:\n\n  **Numerator:**\n  \\[\n  xy + yz + zx = xy + y(-(x+y)) + x(-(x+y)) = xy - yx - y^2 - x^2 - xy = -x^2 - y^2 - xy.\n  \\]\n\n  **Denominator:**\n  \\[\n  x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (-x-y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2xy.\n  \\]\n\nNow let's form the expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{-x^2 - y^2 - xy}{2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2xy} = \\frac{-(x^2 + y^2 + xy)}{2(x^2 + y^2 + xy)} = -\\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\n\nReflection and Check:\n- Wow, the expression simplifies quite nicely to \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\). But could this really be the maximum? Given the simplification, \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) seems like a potential candidate for the bound.\n- I should consider whether this result holds generally, or if there are specific conditions that would allow this maximum.\n\nNow let's verify by testing some values:\n- If \\(x\\), \\(y\\) are distinct such as \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = -2\\), then obviously \\(z = -(1 - 2) = 1\\):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Numerator: } xy + yz + zx = 1(-2) + (-2)(1) + (1)(1) = -2 - 2 + 1 = -3.\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Denominator: } x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1^2 + (-2)^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\therefore \\frac{-3}{6} = -\\frac{1}{2}.\n  \\]\n\nDouble-check using specific values confirming \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\) seems achievable consistently by taking distinct values, confirming our approach.\n\nConclusion:\n- From the expression manipulation and testing, the maximum value achieved is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) due to the symmetry and condition leveraging.\n- Therefore, the maximum possible value of \\(\\frac{xy+yz+zx}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Note that $0=(x+y+z)^2=x^2+y^2+z^2+2xy+2yz+2zx$. Rearranging, we get that $xy+yz+zx=-\\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2+z^2)$, so that in fact the quantity is always equal to $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$."
