    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the task of rationalizing the denominator in the expression \\(\\frac{33}{\\sqrt{33}}\\).\n\n**Step 1: Initial Thoughts**\n- At first glance, I recognize that the issue here is the square root in the denominator. I've seen problems like this before where we multiply by something to get rid of that square root.\n- My first instinct is to consider multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same quantity to rationalize the denominator\u2014it has to be the square root itself, right? So maybe \\(\\sqrt{33}\\)?\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorming Approaches**\n- One usual approach I've encountered is multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the irrational unit in the denominator, which in this case is \\(\\sqrt{33}\\).\n- We should try multiplying \\(\\frac{33}{\\sqrt{33}}\\) by \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{\\sqrt{33}}\\) to see if that helps.\n\n**Step 3: Attempt to Solve**\n- Multiply the expression \\(\\frac{33}{\\sqrt{33}}\\) by \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{\\sqrt{33}}\\).\n  \\[\n  \\frac{33}{\\sqrt{33}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{\\sqrt{33}} = \\frac{33 \\times \\sqrt{33}}{\\sqrt{33} \\times \\sqrt{33}} \n  \\]\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Expression**\n- Now, the denominator becomes \\(\\sqrt{33} \\times \\sqrt{33} = (\\sqrt{33})^2 = 33\\).\n- The numerator is \\(33 \\times \\sqrt{33} = 33\\sqrt{33}\\).\n\n**Step 5: Reflection and Simplification**\n- The new expression should be \\(\\frac{33\\sqrt{33}}{33}\\).\n- Simplifying it further since 33 in both the numerator and the denominator can be canceled out, leaving us with \\(\\sqrt{33}\\).\n\n**Step 6: Verifying and Conclusion**\n- Let's confirm by checking: The original was \\(\\frac{33}{\\sqrt{33}}\\) and after rationalizing, we got \\(\\sqrt{33}\\).\n- This makes sense because multiplying by \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{\\sqrt{33}}\\) should clear the square root in the denominator.\n- A quick check: multiplying back, does \\(\\sqrt{33} \\times \\sqrt{33}\\) become 33? Yes, it does, confirming our denominator was indeed rationalized and we did apply the process correctly.\n\nThus, the expression \\(\\frac{33}{\\sqrt{33}}\\) simplifies to \\(\\sqrt{33}\\).\n\nI\u2019m inclined to think this was the correct approach and solution since it aligns with the rationalization technique I've used previously.",
