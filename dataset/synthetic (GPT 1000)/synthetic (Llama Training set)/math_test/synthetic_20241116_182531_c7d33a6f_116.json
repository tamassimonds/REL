An arithmetic sequence is one where each term is a constant difference from the previous term. So if I know two terms, I should be able to figure out the difference between them and then find any other terms I need. \n\nBut there's definitely a part of me, thinking: \"Okay, but how exactly do I get the fiftieth term when I only have the second and ninth?\"\n\n### Brainstorming:\n\n1. **Notation and Formula**: I remember that for an arithmetic sequence, the \\( n \\)-th term can be found using the formula:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\times d\n   \\]\n   where \\( a_n \\) is the \\( n \\)-th term, \\( a_1 \\) is the first term, and \\( d \\) is the common difference.\n\n2. **Given Information**: \n   - Second term (\\( a_2 \\)) = 2\n   - Ninth term (\\( a_9 \\)) = 30\n\n3. **Plan**: \n   - Find the common difference, \\( d \\).\n   - Use it to find the first term, \\( a_1 \\).\n   - Once I have \\( a_1 \\) and \\( d \\), find the fiftieth term.\n\n### Step-by-step Execution:\n\n#### Step 1: Find the Common Difference \\( d \\)\n\nUsing the formula for the terms in the sequence:\n\n- For the second term: \n  \\[\n  a_2 = a_1 + 1 \\times d = 2\n  \\]\n\n- For the ninth term: \n  \\[\n  a_9 = a_1 + 8 \\times d = 30\n  \\]\n\nNow, if I subtract the first equation from the second, I can eliminate \\( a_1 \\):\n\n\\[\n(a_1 + 8d) - (a_1 + 1d) = 30 - 2\n\\]\n\nSolving that gives:\n\n\\[\n7d = 28 \\implies d = 4\n\\]\n\n### Quick Check:\n\nOkay, I should pause and check: Does this make sense? Substituting \\( d = 4 \\) back into both original equations:\n\n- Check with \\( a_2: \\, a_1 + 4 = 2 \\) gives \\( a_1 = -2 \\).\n- Check the \\( a_9 \\): \\( -2 + 8 \\times 4 = 30 \\). It works!\n\nGreat, both checks passed. I feel confident about \\( d = 4 \\) and \\( a_1 = -2 \\).\n\n#### Step 2: Find the Fiftieth Term\n\nNow I need the fiftieth term, \\( a_{50} \\), using the formula:\n\n\\[\na_{50} = a_1 + 49 \\times d \n\\]\n\nSubstituting what I know:\n\n\\[\na_{50} = -2 + 49 \\times 4 \n\\]\n\n\\[\na_{50} = -2 + 196 \n\\]\n\n\\[\na_{50} = 194\n\\]\n\n### Final Reflection:\n\nHmm, everything seems to check out here. The calculations look logical, and I double-checked a few intermediate steps to confirm. So the fiftieth term of the arithmetic sequence is \\( 194 \\).\n\nThis method feels complete, and I don't see another more straightforward solution considering the information given. The steps logically flowed one into the other. I feel pretty confident in this solution!",

  "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the first term, and let $d$ be the common difference.  Then the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a + (n - 1)d$.  In particular, the second term is $a + d = 2$, and the ninth term is $a + 8d = 30$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $7d = 28$, so $d = 4$.  Substituting this into the equation $a + d = 2$, we get $a + 4 = 2$, so $a = -2$.\n\nThen the fiftieth term is $a + 49d = -2 + 49 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{194}$."
