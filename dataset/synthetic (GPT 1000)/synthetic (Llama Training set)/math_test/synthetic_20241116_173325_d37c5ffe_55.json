    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem together step by step. I'll unpack my thought process as we go.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nThe problem involves a geometric sequence where we know a couple of differences between terms: $a_5 - a_4 = 576$ and $a_2 - a_1 = 9$. We are asked to find the sum of the first five terms of this sequence: $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5$.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n1. **Geometric Sequence Basics**: In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero number called the common ratio, $r$. So, for this sequence:\n   - \\( a_2 = a_1 \\times r \\)\n   - \\( a_3 = a_1 \\times r^2 \\)\n   - \\( a_4 = a_1 \\times r^3 \\)\n   - \\( a_5 = a_1 \\times r^4 \\)\n\n2. **Equations from Differences**: We can form equations from the given differences:\n   - \\( a_5 - a_4 = 576 \\) translates to \\( a_1 \\times r^4 - a_1 \\times r^3 = 576 \\).\n   - \\( a_2 - a_1 = 9 \\) translates to \\( a_1 \\times r - a_1 = 9 \\).\n\n### Developing Equations\nLet's reorganize these:\n1. **From $a_5 - a_4 = 576$**:\n   \\[\n   a_1 \\times r^3 (r - 1) = 576\n   \\]\n2. **From $a_2 - a_1 = 9$**:\n   \\[\n   a_1 (r - 1) = 9\n   \\]\n\n### Solving for Variables\nNow let's solve:\n\n- **From the second equation**: \n  \\[\n  a_1 = \\frac{9}{r-1}\n  \\]\n  This is an expression for $a_1$ in terms of $r$.\n\n- **Substitute $a_1$ in the first equation**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{9}{r-1} \\times r^3 (r-1) = 576\n  \\]\n  Simplifying gives:\n  \\[\n  9r^3 = 576\n  \\]\n  Solving for $r$:\n  \\[\n  r^3 = \\frac{576}{9} = 64\n  \\]\n  So, \\( r = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \\).\n\n### Find $a_1$\nNow that we know $r = 4$, use the equation for $a_1$:\n\\[\na_1 = \\frac{9}{4 - 1} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3\n\\]\n\n### Calculating the Sequence\nWith $a_1 = 3$ and $r = 4$, we can find all terms:\n\n- \\( a_2 = a_1 \\times r = 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\)\n- \\( a_3 = a_2 \\times r = 12 \\times 4 = 48 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = a_3 \\times r = 48 \\times 4 = 192 \\)\n- \\( a_5 = a_4 \\times r = 192 \\times 4 = 768 \\)\n\n### Sum of the Terms\nFinally, sum these up:\n\\[\na_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 3 + 12 + 48 + 192 + 768\n\\]\n\nLet's do the arithmetic:\n- 3 + 12 = 15\n- 15 + 48 = 63\n- 63 + 192 = 255\n- 255 + 768 = 1023\n\nSo, \\( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 1023 \\).\n\n### Final Reflection\nEverything checks out. The step-by-step calculations align with the required conditions of the problem. The approach using the properties of geometric sequences and given differences was the right choice here. I feel confident in this result.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the first term, and let $r$ be the common ratio.  Then $ar^4 - ar^3 = 576,$ so $ar^3 (r - 1) = 576.$  Also, $ar - a = 9,$ so $a(r - 1) = 9.$  Then $9r^3 = 576,$ so $r = 4.$  Then $3a = 9,$ so $a = 3.$  Therefore,\n\\[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 3 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\cdot 4^2 + 3 \\cdot 4^3 + 3 \\cdot 4^4 = \\frac{3 (4^5 - 1)}{4 - 1} = \\boxed{1023}.\\]"
