    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The task is to find the largest integer less than 1000 that is divisible by 11.\n\n### Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts:\n\n1. **Understanding the problem:** \n   - We're looking for a number close to 1000 that is divisible by 11. \n   - Divisibility by 11 means the number can be divided by 11 without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Initial Strategy Ideas:**\n   - One way to approach this is to find the largest multiple of 11 less than 1000.\n   - Another idea could be to directly divide 1000 by 11 and explore the result. Let's explore both.\n\n### Strategy 1: Finding the Largest Multiple Directly\n\n**Step-by-Step Execution:**\n\n- Start with numbers close to 1000 and check divisibility:\n  - Begin with 999, 998, etc., and check which one is divisible by 11. \n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - \\( 1000 \\mod 11 \\)\n  \n- **Thought Process:**\n  - 1000 divided by 11 gives you an exact quotient and a remainder:\n\n\\[\n1000 \\div 11 = \\text{Quotient with remainder}\n\\]\n  \n- **Groundwork Calculation:**\n  - Perform \\(1000 \\div 11\\): \n  - 11 into 1000 goes approximately 90 times (since \\(11 \\times 90 = 990\\)).\n  - Check, \\(11 \\times 91 = 1001\\) which is greater than 1000. So, 990 is better.\n\n- **Verification:**\n  - Check divisibility of 990: \\( 990 \\div 11 = 90 \\). \n  - Since this division yields no remainder, it confirms 990 is a multiple of 11.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- 990 is less than 1000 and divisible by 11. So it seems like we have an answer. \n\n### Reflect and Verify\n\n- Using our earlier checks, it looks consistent. \n- Confirmations align with the calculations: \\(1000 \\div 11 = 90\\) with a remainder of 10, thus leading us to 990.\n  \n**Thought Process Continuation:**\n\n- **Sanity Check:**\n  - Cross-reference with multiples of 11 close to 1000:\n     - \\(11 \\times 90 = 990\\)\n     - \\(11 \\times 91 = 1001\\) (overshoot)\n  \n- **Double-check Logic:**\n  - Was there any step where a mistake could be made? \n  - Every step seems reasonable, leveraged the simple modulo and division checks efficiently.\n\n**Final Verification and Conclusion:**\n\nThrough following initial instincts and checking along the way, we've confirmed the solution. The largest integer less than 1000 which is divisible by 11 is indeed **990**. All logical and mathematical pathways lead back to this conclusion, reinforcing our confidence in this result.",

  "ground_truth": "We find that 1000 gives a quotient of 90 and a remainder of 10 when divided by 11. Therefore, if we subtract 10 from 1000 we should subtract 10 from the remainder as well, which gives us zero. This means that $1000-10 = \\boxed{990}$ is divisible by 11, while the next number divisible by 11 is $990+11 = 1001.$"
