    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. My task is to find the minimum value of the expression \\(x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 4y + 8\\) for real \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). To do so, I need to figure out how to approach simplifying or transforming this expression to make it easier to identify the minimum. \n\n**First thoughts:**\n\n1. **Recognizable Patterns:** This expression is a quadratic in two variables, which might suggest that completing the square could be useful. Completing the square is often helpful in finding minima or maxima of quadratic expressions. \n\n2. **Comparison to Known Forms:** Such expressions often resemble the form \\( (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + c \\), where \\((a, b)\\) is the center of a circle or parabola, and \\(c\\) adjusts for displacement. When we can transform our expression into such a form, finding the minimum becomes straightforward.\n\n**Strategy Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Completing the Square:** This approach needs checking if it works to isolate squares that can be simplified further.\n- **Taking Partial Derivatives:** An alternative method could be to find the point at which partial derivatives with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) vanish. That could also lead to a point where a minimum occurs.\n- **Graphical Interpretation (Conceptual):** Visualizing how the expression behaves with changes in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) can sometimes provide intuition about symmetry or shifts.\n\nLet's start with the step-by-step execution using completing the square, as that seems the most direct:\n\n**Step 1: Completing the square in terms of \\(x\\):**\n\n- The \\(x\\) terms are \\(x^2 + 2x\\). \n- Complete the square: \n\n\\[ x^2 + 2x = (x + 1)^2 - 1 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Completing the square in terms of \\(y\\):**\n\n- The \\(y\\) terms are \\(y^2 - 4y\\).\n- Complete the square: \n\n\\[ y^2 - 4y = (y - 2)^2 - 4 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Rewrite the entire expression using these squares:**\n\n- Substitute the completed squares back into the original expression:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 2x + y^2 - 4y + 8 = (x + 1)^2 - 1 + (y - 2)^2 - 4 + 8 \\]\n\n- Simplify:\n\n\\[ = (x + 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + 3 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the completed square form:**\n\n- The expression \\((x + 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + 3\\) is clearly minimized when both squared terms are zero, because squares reach their minimum at zero.\n    - \\((x + 1)^2 = 0\\) results in \\(x = -1\\).\n    - \\((y - 2)^2 = 0\\) results in \\(y = 2\\).\n\n- Substituting these back in, the minimum value is found at:\n\n\\[ (x, y) = (-1, 2) \\]\n\n- The value of the expression at this point is:\n\n\\[ 0 + 0 + 3 = 3 \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe minimum value of the expression \\(x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 4y + 8\\) is 3, occurring when \\(x = -1\\) and \\(y = 2\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nA quick check with these \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) values confirms:\n\n\\[ (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 1 = 0 \\] and \\[ (2)^2 - 4(2) + 4 = 0 \\] \n\nEverything simplifies back to 3, confirming the calculated minimum value holds true.\n\nHaving reviewed the steps and transformations, the approach seems valid and sound, reaffirming the solution process and its completeness. This exercise showed completing the square to derive a minimum value worked effectively.",

  "ground_truth": "Rearranging the expression, we have  \\[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \\[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \\Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$."
