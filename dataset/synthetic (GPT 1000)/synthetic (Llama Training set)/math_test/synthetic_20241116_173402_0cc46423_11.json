    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem by gradually peeling back its layers. At first glance, the expression seems to involve trigonometric functions raised to powers, and this instantly reminds me of certain trigonometry identities or algebraic manipulations that could simplify things.\n\n**Initial thoughts:**\n- We need to simplify the expression \\(\\frac{\\sin^4 x + \\cos^4 x - 1}{\\sin^6 x + \\cos^6 x - 1}\\).\n- The presence of \\(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\\) is a classic identity that comes to mind and could potentially be useful.\n- These powers of trigonometric functions remind me of algebraic identities like the sum of squares or cubes.\n\n**Step-by-step exploration:**\n\n1. **Focus on the numerator**: \n   - We have \\(\\sin^4 x + \\cos^4 x - 1\\).\n   - There's a known identity for \\(\\sin^4 x + \\cos^4 x\\): \\((\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x)^2 - 2\\sin^2 x\\cos^2 x\\).\n   - Since \\(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\\), this simplifies to \\(1 - 2\\sin^2 x\\cos^2 x\\).\n\n2. **Rewriting the numerator**:\n   - Substituting the simplification, we get \\(1 - 2\\sin^2 x\\cos^2 x - 1\\), which further simplifies to \\(-2\\sin^2 x\\cos^2 x\\).\n\n3. **Now, the denominator**:\n   - \\(\\sin^6 x + \\cos^6 x - 1\\) is a bit more complex.\n   - The expression \\(\\sin^6 x + \\cos^6 x\\) can be factored using a variation of the sum of cubes: \\((\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x)(\\sin^4 x - \\sin^2 x\\cos^2 x + \\cos^4 x)\\), but since \\(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\\), we just have \\(\\sin^4 x - \\sin^2 x\\cos^2 x + \\cos^4 x\\).\n\n4. **Rewriting the denominator more efficiently**:\n   - Notice \\(\\sin^6 x + \\cos^6 x = (\\sin^2 x)^3 + (\\cos^2 x)^3\\).\n   - The identity for sum of cubes gives us \\((\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x)((\\sin^2 x)^2 - \\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x + (\\cos^2 x)^2)\\).\n   - Again using \\(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\\), we have \\((\\sin^2 x)^2 - \\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x + (\\cos^2 x)^2 = \\sin^4 x - \\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x + \\cos^4 x\\).\n\n5. **Simplify and observe:** \n   - The denominator is then: \\(\\sin^4 x - \\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x + \\cos^4 x - 1\\).\n   - Previously, we rewrote \\(\\sin^4 x + \\cos^4 x = 1 - 2\\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x\\). Hence, rephrasing the expression: \\((1 - 2\\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x) - \\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x\\) simplifies further to \\(1 - 3\\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x - 1 = -3\\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x\\).\n\n6. **Verification and Final Calculation**:\n   - Both the numerator and the denominator simplify to \\(-2\\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x\\) and \\(-3\\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x\\) respectively.\n   - Ratio: \\(\\frac{-2\\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x}{-3\\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nThroughout this process, I double-checked my algebraic manipulations against known identities, ensuring the strategy fit the given problem. The consistent appearance of \\(\\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x\\) helped verify the simplifications were on track. The final result is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). This was a surprisingly elegant solution that appeared from what seemed a complex problem on the surface.",
