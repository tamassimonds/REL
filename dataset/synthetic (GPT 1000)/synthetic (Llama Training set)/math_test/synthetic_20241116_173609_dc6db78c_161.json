    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about the circle.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- The problem is asking for the area of a circle, expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\).\n- We can see from the diagram that the center of the circle is at the point \\(C(3, 1)\\) and there's another point on the circle at \\((8, 1)\\).\n- This looks like a classic circle geometry problem where we need to find the radius first.\n\n**First Step: Understand the Relationship:**\n- To find the area of a circle, the standard formula is \\(A = \\pi \\times r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius.\n- We have to determine the radius \\(r\\) from the given points.\n\n**Second Thought: How to Find the Radius:**\n- I remember that the radius is simply the distance from the center of the circle \\(C(3, 1)\\) to any point on the circle.\n- Given another point on the circle \\((8, 1)\\), I think we can just use the distance formula here:\n  \n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n  \nwhere \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is the center \\((3, 1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is the point on the circle \\((8, 1)\\).\n\n**Calculation of the Radius:**\n- Let's calculate the distance:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Radius } r = \\sqrt{(8 - 3)^2 + (1 - 1)^2}\n\\]\n  \n\\[\n= \\sqrt{5^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n\\]\n\n- Great, this seems straightforward. The radius \\(r\\) is \\(5\\).\n\n**Now, Find the Area of the Circle:**\n- With the radius \\(r = 5\\), the area \\(A\\) of the circle can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\times r^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\times 5^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\times 25\n\\]\n\n\\[\nA = 25\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Check My Work:**\n- Let me reflect on this for a moment... The radius calculation seems sound as we're merely applying the distance formula correctly.\n- The algebra involved in squaring \\(5\\) and multiplying by \\(\\pi\\) aligns with my understanding.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- I feel confident in this solution, the area of the circle is correctly expressed as \\(25\\pi\\).\n\nThis solution is comprehensive, and I've revisited each step to ensure all calculations align with the given information.",
