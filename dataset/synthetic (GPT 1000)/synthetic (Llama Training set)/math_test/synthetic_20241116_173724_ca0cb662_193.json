    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: \n\nWe need to find the remainder when \\(225^{66} - 327^{66}\\) is divided by 17. At first glance, this seems to ring a bell with known theorems and modular arithmetic. \n\n### 1. Initial Brainstorming\n\nFirst thoughts:\n- This reminds me of working with powers and modular arithmetic, where Fermat's Little Theorem might be useful.\n- The bases 225 and 327 are significantly larger than 17, so it might be useful to reduce these modulo 17 first.\n- It seems like reducing large numbers could simplify calculations significantly.\n\nOkay, let me start by reducing the numbers modulo 17.\n\n### 2. Reducing Bases Modulo 17\n\nLet's first reduce 225 and 327 mod 17:\n\n**For 225:**\n- Calculate \\(225 \\mod 17\\).\n- \\(225 \\div 17 \\approx 13.235\\), so \\(225 = 17 \\times 13 + r\\), where \\(r\\) is the remainder.\n- \\(17 \\times 13 = 221\\).\n- \\(225 - 221 = 4\\), so \\(225 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{17}\\).\n\n**For 327:**\n- Calculate \\(327 \\mod 17\\).\n- \\(327 \\div 17 \\approx 19.235\\), so \\(327 = 17 \\times 19 + r\\).\n- \\(17 \\times 19 = 323\\).\n- \\(327 - 323 = 4\\), so \\(327 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{17}\\).\n\nOkay, this is interesting! Both \\(225 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{17}\\) and \\(327 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{17}\\). Let's reflect for a moment. This means something important: \n\n### 3. Observing the Simplification\n\n**Checking:**  \nIf both are congruent to 4 modulo 17, then \\(225^{66} \\equiv 4^{66} \\pmod{17}\\) and \\(327^{66} \\equiv 4^{66} \\pmod{17}\\). \n\nThis simplifies the problem immensely:\n\n\\[\n225^{66} - 327^{66} \\equiv 4^{66} - 4^{66} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{17}\n\\]\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe remainder when \\(225^{66} - 327^{66}\\) is divided by 17 is 0.\n\n### Final Check\nThis aligns perfectly with what the simplification suggested. Since both expressions boil down to the same base modulo 17 and are raised to equal powers, their difference indeed should be zero modulo 17. \n\nWell, this path made the computation smooth, bypassing intricate calculations with Fermat's Theorem since the congruence of bases occurred.\n\nThe result is correct, and everything makes sense! \n\nThus, the remainder is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "First we use the property that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$.\n\nSince $225 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{17}$ and $327 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{17}$, $$225^{66}-327^{66} \\equiv 4^{66}-4^{66}=\\boxed{0} \\pmod{17}.$$"
