    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step-by-step. \n\n**First Impression**: \n\nThe problem involves a square with side length 10 inches, and we're cutting off congruent isosceles right triangles from each corner to form an octagon with equal side lengths. My first thought is to sketch the scenario. I visualize the original square and see that removing parts from each corner will form a new shape, specifically an octagon. I need to figure out how large the cuts need to be in order for the remaining sides to be equal.\n\n**Initial Sketch and Understanding**:\n\n1. **Understanding the Square and Triangles**: \n   - The original square has side 10 inches.\n   - Each cut-off is an isosceles right triangle, meaning its two equal sides are perpendicular to each other.\n\n2. **Visualize the Octagon**:\n   - Cutting a triangle from each corner leaves a shape with eight sides (the octagon).\n   - The triangles are congruent, so they will all have equal short sides.\n\n   Okay, I can see that if we lay the octagon flat, its perimeter would be the original square minus the indents, plus the new sides formed by these cuts.\n\n**Exploring a Strategy**:\n\n3. **Determine Relationship for Equal Sides**:\n   - I need to express the length of one side of the new octagon in terms of the triangle cuts. Let's denote the leg length of each triangle (the amount cut from each corner) as \\( x \\).\n\n   - Each original side of the square will then transform into a section of the octagon, retaining the length \\( 10 - 2x \\) (because we cut \\( x \\) from each end of one square side).\n\n   - The sides of the octagon are therefore composed of these sections supplemented by two legs \\( x \\) from the adjacent triangles.\n   \n   - Thus, each side of the octagon results from:\n     \\[\n     10 - 2x + \\sqrt{2}x = s\n     \\]\n     where \\( s \\) is the side length of the octagon.\n\n**Calculating the Octagon Side**:\n\n4. **Solve for \\( s \\)**:\n   - The octagon is regular, so each of its sides is equal, giving us:\n     \\[\n     s = 10 - 2x + \\sqrt{2}x\n     \\]\n     Simplified form:\n     \\[\n     s = 10 - (2 - \\sqrt{2})x\n     \\]\n\n5. **Express Each Side**:\n   - Since there are 8 equal sides making the total perimeter, we must use two of the \\( x \\) plus parts of two adjacent \\( 10 - 2x \\) as part of \\( s \\) to close off the count of octagonal sides.\n\n     Solving for \\( s \\) yields: \n     \\[\n     (4x + (10 - 2x)) = s\n     \\]\n\n**Evaluation at an Intuitive Cut**:\n\n6. **Adjustment and Recalculation**:\n   - Recognizing symmetry in the square, all sides would close perfectly only when:\n   \n     \\[\n     s = 10 - 2 \\cdot \\frac{10 - 2x}{3}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Substitute Values**:\n   - Choose the final value via checking:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{10}{1+ \\sqrt{2}}\n     \\]\n     \n- Checking involves substitution into \\( s = 10 - 2x + \\sqrt{2}x \\)\n\n- \\( s = 2.928... \\)\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n\n   The length of each side of the octagon is roughly \\( 2.93 \\) inches rounded to the nearest hundredth. It's important to have this confirmed by revisiting steps and assumptions made.\n\nI will revisit any step if the final number still feels off contextually with sensible checks on derived formulas.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous approach. Let's take another look and approach the problem by re-evaluating my assumptions and calculations. \n\n**Re-evaluation and Reflection:**\n\nUpon reflecting, I've realized that while I was correct in considering the cuts and the transformation of the square into an octagon, my calculation of the side length \\( s \\) failed to accurately integrate the relationships between the triangle cuts and the square's dimensions.\n\n**New Strategy and Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Triangle-Square Relationship:**\n   - Each corner of the square is cut to form an isosceles right triangle.\n   - The side length of the square is originally 10 inches, and I need to ensure that the segments remaining after cuts form equal sides of an octagon.\n\n2. **Alternative Setup:**\n   - Let's denote the side of each isosceles right triangle (the leg length) as \\( x \\).\n   - For an isosceles right triangle, the hypotenuse is \\( x\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n3. **Reconsidering the Side Contributions:**\n   - Each side of the octagon includes:\n     - Two segments derived from the hypotenuse of \\( x\\sqrt{2}/2 \\) from the triangles.\n     - One segment equal in length to one side of the octagon \\( s \\).\n\n4. **Setting Up Equations:**\n   - The sum of these three contributions is equal to each original side of the square:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}} + s + \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}} = 10\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( s \\):**\n   - Simplifying the equation:\n   \\[\n   s + \\sqrt{2}x = 10\n   \\]\n\n6. **Revisiting the Perimeter Relationship:**\n   - The total perimeter of the octagon should equal that of the modified square: \\( 8s \\).\n\n7. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Solve for \\( s \\):\n   \\[\n   s(\\sqrt{2} + 1) = 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2} + 1} = 10(\\sqrt{2} - 1)\n   \\]\n   - Rationalizing the denominator leads us to find that \\( s \\approx 4.14 \\) when calculated precisely.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- By calculating \\( s \\) as \\( 10(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \\), and converting this into a decimal, we get an approximation of \\( s = 4.14 \\).\n\nThis corrected approach aligns with the geometry of the octagon and reflects the geometric adjustments required for the triangle cuts. Thereby, the length of one side of the octagon is indeed \\( 4.14 \\) inches, rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
