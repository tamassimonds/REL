    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, capturing my thoughts and possible strategies for solving it. Here we go:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We are told a number, when divided by 7, gives a quotient of 28 and a remainder of 6. \n   - We need to find what this number is.\n\n2. **Initial Thoughts:**\n   - At first glance, this reminds me of division problems I've solved before, where you can express the number using the quotient, divisor, and remainder.\n   - I remember a similar type of problem where the formula used was: \\( \\text{Number} = (\\text{Quotient} \\times \\text{Divisor}) + \\text{Remainder} \\).\n\n3. **Applying the Formula:**\n   - Let's break this down using the formula: \n   - If the number when divided by 7 gives a quotient of 28 and a remainder of 6, then:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number} = (28 \\times 7) + 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Quick Calculation:**\n   - Alright, let's do the multiplication first:\n   \\[\n   28 \\times 7 = 196\n   \\]\n   - Now, adding the remainder:\n   \\[\n   196 + 6 = 202\n   \\]\n   - So, the number appears to be 202.\n\n5. **Reflecting on the Solution:**\n   - Okay, let's pause for a moment and consider the logic in the solution. The formula seems correct: we calculated \\(28 \\times 7\\) to get the part of the number divisible by 7, then added 6 as the remaining pieces.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - Let's check the answer by ensuring 202 divided by 7 indeed gives a quotient of 28 and a remainder of 6.\n   - Divide 202 by 7:\n     - \\(202 \\div 7 = 28\\) remainder 6.\n   - Yep! That matches perfectly. The quotient is 28, and the remainder is really 6.\n\n7. **Final Thoughts:**\n   - Everything checks out, and I'm confident in my solution.\n   - It's satisfying to see the consistent application of a formula working as expected, strengthening my understanding of division and remainders.\n\nThe number is **202**.",
