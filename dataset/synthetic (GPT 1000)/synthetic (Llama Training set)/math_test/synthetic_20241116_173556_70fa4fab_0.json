    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nMy first impression of this problem is that it involves finding the distance between two points, given their distances from a common location. This rings a bell about similar problems involving geometric configurations, possibly forming a geometric shape like a triangle. \n\nThe problem states:\n- The airport is 8 miles southwest of downtown St. Paul.\n- The airport is 10 miles southeast of downtown Minneapolis.\n\nWe need to find the distance between downtown St. Paul and downtown Minneapolis. Hmm, this sounds like a question related to points on a triangle, possibly a right-angled triangle given the directional references (southwest and southeast).\n\n### Step 2: Visualizing the Problem\n\nOh! This reminds me of a triangle problem \u2013 specifically the concept of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. Let\u2019s visualize:\n\n1. Imagine a triangle where:\n   - The airport is at a point.\n   - One vertex is downtown St. Paul.\n   - Another vertex is downtown Minneapolis.\n\nGiven:\n- One side is 8 miles (St. Paul to the Airport).\n- Another side is 10 miles (Minneapolis to the Airport).\n\nThe distance we seek, between the downtown areas, is likely the third side of the triangle.\n\n### Step 3: Confirming the Use of the Pythagorean Theorem\n\nWait a second... Before jumping directly into calculations, I should check if we're really dealing with a right triangle, as this affects if the Pythagorean theorem applies. The directional hints (southwest and southeast) suggest perpendicular directions. Confirming that the angle between these directions is indeed 90 degrees makes the triangle a right triangle. This justifies using the theorem.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem\n\nNow, let's calculate using the assumption it's a right triangle:\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a = 8 \\) (St. Paul to the Airport)\n- \\( b = 10 \\) (Minneapolis to the Airport)\n- \\( c \\) is the distance between downtown St. Paul and downtown Minneapolis.\n\n\\[ 8^2 + 10^2 = c^2 \\]\n\\[ 64 + 100 = c^2 \\]\n\\[ 164 = c^2 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Solving for \\( c \\)\n\nTo find \\( c \\), take the square root:\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{164} \\]\n\nHmm, let\u2019s calculate that. Punching in the numbers on a calculator:\n\n\\[ c \\approx 12.8062 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Rounding Off\n\nThe problem asks to round to the nearest integer. So:\n\n\\[ c \\approx 13 \\]\n\n### Step 7: Final Check\n\nQuick check \u2013 does this make sense? The numbers seem in line with normal triangle side lengths, where the hypotenuse (our answer \\( c \\)) should be the longest side, and indeed, 13 is longer than both 8 and 10.\n\nA final reconsideration: \"Is there an easier way?\" I don\u2019t think so, since we verified the triangle structure and correctly applied the theorem.\n\nSo, my rounded answer:\n- The distance between downtown St. Paul and downtown Minneapolis is approximately 13 miles.\n\nAnswer: 13 miles",

  "ground_truth": "Let downtown St. Paul, downtown Minneapolis, and the airport be located at $S$, $M$, and $A$, respectively. Then $\\triangle MAS$ has a right angle at $A$, so by the Pythagorean Theorem, \\[\nMS= \\sqrt{10^{2}+8^{2}}= \\sqrt{164}\\approx 12.8.\n\\] Therefore, the distance between the two downtowns to the nearest mile is  $\\boxed{\\text{13}}$ miles."
