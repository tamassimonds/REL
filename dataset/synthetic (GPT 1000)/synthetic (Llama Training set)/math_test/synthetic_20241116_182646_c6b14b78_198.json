    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into converting the decimal number \\(222_{10}\\) into base \\(13\\). \n\n### Initial Thoughts\nWhen I first see a problem like this, it reminds me of other number base conversion problems I've tackled before. The basic idea is to repeatedly divide the number by the base (in this case, 13) and keep track of the remainders. Hmm, I know I should be careful about the remainders because they become the new digits in the base 13 number, reading them from bottom to top.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategy\n1. **Division:** Repeatedly divide 222 by 13, noting the quotient and remainder at each step.\n2. **Remainder Tracking:** The remainder will provide the digits for the base 13 number.\n3. **Conversion Check:** After obtaining the base 13 number, I'll convert it back to base 10 to verify correctness.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Conversion\n\n1. **First Division:**  \n   \\(222 \\div 13 = 17\\) with a remainder.  \n   - Calculation: \\(13 \\times 17 = 221\\), so \\(222 - 221 = 1\\).  \n   - Therefore, the remainder is 1.  \n   - First remainder (rightmost digit in base 13) is 1.\n\n2. **Second Division:**  \n   Now take the quotient 17 and divide by 13.  \n   \\(17 \\div 13 = 1\\) with a remainder.  \n   - Calculation: \\(13 \\times 1 = 13\\), so \\(17 - 13 = 4\\).  \n   - Therefore, the remainder is 4.  \n   - Second digit from the right in base 13 is 4.\n\n3. **Third Division:**  \n   Now take the quotient 1 and divide by 13.  \n   \\(1 \\div 13 = 0\\) with a remainder.  \n   - Calculation: No further division possible as 1 is less than 13.  \n   - Therefore, the remainder is 1.  \n   - Third digit (leftmost in base 13) is 1.\n\n### Assembling the Digits\nReading the remainders from last to first, we arrange them into the base 13 number:  \nThus, \\(222_{10}\\) becomes \\(141_{13}\\).\n\n### Reflection and Verification\nTo ensure this is correct, let's convert \\(141_{13}\\) back to base 10 to see if we get 222 again. \n\n- Starting from the leftmost digit:\n  - \\(1 \\times 13^2 = 169\\)\n  - \\(4 \\times 13^1 = 52\\)\n  - \\(1 \\times 13^0 = 1\\)\n\nAdding these gives \\(169 + 52 + 1 = 222\\).\n\nThis checks out, so it seems the conversion is correct! \n\nThat felt like a bit of a mental journey, but each piece gradually fell into place. Reflecting on this, the division method made sense here, and checking the reversal confirmed everything was right. It's important to keep these verification steps in mind\u2014they really help ensure I've not missed anything.",

  "ground_truth": "The largest power of $13$ which is smaller than $222$ is $13^2=169$. The largest multiple of $169$ less than $222$ is $1\\cdot 169$, and $222-1 \\cdot 169 = 53$. The largest power of $13$ which is smaller than $53$ is $13$, and the largest multiple of $13$ less than $53$ is $4\\cdot 13$. $53-4 \\cdot 13= 1$. Thus, $222=1 \\cdot 13^2 + 4 \\cdot 13^1 + 1 \\cdot 13^0$. So $222$ in base $13$ is $\\boxed{141_{13}}$."
