    "working_out": "Let's approach this problem systematically and break it down step by step. \n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\n- **Initial thoughts:** I have a soccer team with 15 members and need to select a starting lineup of 11 players. Besides, out of these 11, I need to designate 2 as captains. This reminds me of combinations and permutations. Choosing players seems like a combination problem, while selecting captains might involve permutations because the order of captains matters.\n\n- **Task:** I need two things:\n  1. Choose 11 players out of 15.\n  2. Out of these 11, choose 2 as captains.\n\n**Step 2: Break down the problem and think about strategies**\n\n- **Choosing 11 players from 15 players:**\n  - This is a classic combination problem since the order in which players are selected does not matter.\n  - The formula for combinations is \\(\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\\).\n\n- **Designating 2 captains from 11 players:**\n  - Here, it seems like a permutation because selecting two specific captains out of 11 has different orders (e.g., Captain A and Captain B is different from Captain B and Captain A).\n  - Using combinations followed by permutations seems logical.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the first part**\n\n- **Choosing 11 players:**\n  - Use \\(\\binom{15}{11}\\).\n  - By the combination formula: \n    \\[\n    \\binom{15}{11} = \\frac{15!}{11! \\times (15-11)!} = \\frac{15!}{11! \\times 4!}\n    \\]\n  - Simplifying: \n    \\[\n    = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{32760}{24} = 1365\n    \\]\n  - So, there are 1365 ways to select 11 players from the 15.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the second part**\n\n- **Choosing 2 captains from these 11 players:**\n  - Using combinations \\(\\binom{11}{2}\\) for the two positions gives:\n    \\[\n    \\binom{11}{2} = \\frac{11!}{2! \\times (11-2)!} = \\frac{11 \\times 10}{2 \\times 1} = 55\n    \\]\n  - There are 55 ways to choose 2 captains among the 11 selected players.\n\n**Step 5: Combine these results**\n\n- **Calculate total ways:**\n  - First, choose the players, then choose the captains:\n  - Multiply the number of ways to choose the players by the number of ways to choose captains:\n    - Total ways = \\(1365 \\times 55 = 75075\\).\n\n**Step 6: Reflect and verify**\n\n- **Check the approach:**\n  - Does it make sense to split the problem this way? Yes, choosing players independently from designating captains is logical.\n  - Is the order of operations correct? Yes, combining independent choices via multiplication is appropriate here.\n  - Does the result feel reasonable? Given the two steps, the outcome seems logical and manageable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n- **Final answer:** There are 75,075 ways to choose and arrange the starting lineup including the captains. \n\n- **Reflection:** The approach using combinations followed by permutations felt systematic and aligned well with the problem's needs. Everything checks out logically, and calculations align with expectations.",

  "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{15}{2}=105$ ways to select the 2 captains from among the 15 players on the team. We then need to choose the remaining 9 starters from among the remaining 13 players, which can be done in $\\binom{13}{9}=715$ ways. This gives us a total of $\\binom{15}{2}\\cdot\\binom{13}{9}=105\\cdot715=\\boxed{75,\\!075}$ ways."
