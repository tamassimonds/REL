    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. As I read the question, it's about finding a certain result that involves consecutive whole numbers. My first thought is that this should be solvable by forming an equation with these numbers and then working through the operations of mean and median.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- We are told the sum of a whole number and the next four consecutive whole numbers equals 105. Immediately, I'm reminded of a similar approach I\u2019ve taken with problems involving consecutive numbers. I need to express these numbers algebraically.\n- Let's take a moment to carefully outline the problem. We know there's an arithmetic sequence here, and we need to figure out a way to express this with algebra.\n- Hm, this is starting to feel like it\u2019s leading toward forming an equation. That\u2019s usually a promising route in problems involving consecutive numbers.\n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - Let's assume the first of these five consecutive numbers is \\( x \\).\n   - Therefore, the consecutive numbers are \\( x, x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4 \\).\n\n2. **Form the Equation:**\n   - The sum of these numbers is given as 105. So, we write:\n   \\[\n   x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) + (x+4) = 105\n   \\]\n   - Simplifying the left side, we have:\n   \\[\n   5x + 10 = 105\n   \\]\n   - Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate terms involving \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   5x = 95\n   \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 5:\n   \\[\n   x = 19\n   \\]\n\n3. **Identify the Consecutive Numbers:**\n   - Now that we know \\( x = 19 \\), the numbers are:\n     - 19, 20, 21, 22, 23\n\n4. **Calculate the Mean:**\n   - The mean (average) of these numbers is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mean} = \\frac{19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 23}{5} = \\frac{105}{5} = 21\n   \\]\n\n5. **Identify the Median:**\n   - The median of these numbers (19, 20, 21, 22, 23) is the middle number when they are in order, which is clearly 21.\n\n6. **Compute the Required Result:**\n   - We need to find the result when the median is subtracted from the mean.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Result} = \\text{Median} - \\text{Mean} = 21 - 21 = 0\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- As a quick check, both the calculations for mean and median utilize the fully determined set of numbers, and I\u2019ve ensured they are correct.\n- The logical validations along with calculations seem sound here. The equation was straightforward, and the interpretations matched given definitions of mean and median.\n- This problem ended up being straightforward after setting up the initial equation, which often turns out to be the most challenging part. There's a little \u201caha moment\u201d realizing both the mean and median are the same due to symmetry in consecutive numbers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Everything checks out, and I\u2019m confident the answer is correct. The result is \\( 0 \\) as the mean and median are equal for the sequence of numbers identified.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the given whole number be $x$. The sequence contains five numbers $x,x+1,x+2,x+3,x+4$. Obviously, the mean and the median are both $x+2$, so that their difference is $\\boxed{0}$."
