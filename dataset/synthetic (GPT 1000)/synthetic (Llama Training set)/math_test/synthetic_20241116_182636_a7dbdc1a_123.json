  "problem": "Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.\n\nNote: You cannot \"mix and match\".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.",

    "working_out": "### First Thoughts and Understanding the Question\n\nOkay, let's break this down. We have a Mr. Potato Head toy with several interchangeable parts:  \n- **3 hairstyles**\n- **2 sets of eyebrows**\n- **1 pair of googly eyes** (only one option here)\n- **2 sets of ears**\n- **2 sets of lips**\n- **2 pairs of shoes**: regular shoes and clown shoes\n\nThe question asks about how many different complete \"wacky personalities\" we can create, considering each part must be used where required (eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes), and hair is optional. \n\nA \"complete personality\" requires eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes, and optionally, hair.\n\nRight away, I'm thinking: this seems like a classic combinatorics problem involving options (like clothes combinations). It probably boils down to multiplying possibilities, but let's really think through each step.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Identify Options for Each Part**: \n   - Hair: 3 options + bald = 4 total\n   - Eyebrows: 2 options\n   - Eyes: 1 option\n   - Ears: 2 options\n   - Lips: 2 options\n   - Shoes: 2 options\n\n2. **Use Combinatorial Multiplication**: \n   I think multiplying the number of options for different parts makes sense because each choice is independent of each other. But I need to be sure this approach covers the problem without missing any nuances.\n\n3. **Check for Common Mistakes**:\n   - Are there any hidden dependencies or restrictions? Nope, it seems pretty straightforward with given options.\n   - Make sure to account for optional hair.\n\nLet's test step-by-step.\n\n### Calculating the Number of Combinations\n\n- **Hair Options**: 4 (including bald)\n- **Eyebrows Options**: 2\n- **Eyes Options**: 1 (always the same)\n- **Ears Options**: 2\n- **Lips Options**: 2\n- **Shoes Options**: 2\n\nCalculating the total number of combinations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Combinations} = 4 (\\text{Hair}) \\times 2 (\\text{Eyebrows}) \\times 1 (\\text{Eyes}) \\times 2 (\\text{Ears}) \\times 2 (\\text{Lips}) \\times 2 (\\text{Shoes})\n\\]\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\n1. Start with hair options: \\(4\\)\n2. Multiply by eyebrows options: \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\)\n3. Multiply by eyes options: \\(8 \\times 1 = 8\\)\n4. Multiply by ears options: \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\)\n5. Multiply by lips options: \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\)\n6. Multiply by shoes options: \\(32 \\times 2 = 64\\)\n\n### Reflect and Verify\n\n- **Check Sequence**: Did I follow the right sequence for each part? Yes, each part follows logically with the correct multipliers.\n- **Reevaluate Outcome**: Does 64 sound plausible given the problem? Yes, sounds reasonable considering the number of independently variable parts.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nGiven the steps and calculations above, where each multiplier was based on the independent options available, I feel confident that the solution is correct. Thus, Tom can create **64 different wacky personalities** for his Mr. Potato Head.\n\nIf any step felt off, or if I had miscounted options or logic, I might have second-guessed or rechecked those specific counts. But given what I've outlined, the method and reasoning make sense to me.",

  "ground_truth": "There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\\cdot 1\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{64}$."
