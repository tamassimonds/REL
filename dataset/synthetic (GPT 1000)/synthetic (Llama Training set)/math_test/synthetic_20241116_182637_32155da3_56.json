    "working_out": "Alright, let's get into this problem and unravel it step by step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- This sequence seems to be constructed with a regular pattern: listing a set number of numbers and then skipping. My immediate thought is to figure out that pattern clearly since understanding it will likely be key to finding the specific term we need.\n- The sequence starts with a pattern of listing 4, skipping 1; listing 5, skipping 2; listing 6, skipping 3; and so on. This seems progressive and might suggest an arithmetic pattern.\n- Brainstorming approach: I should calculate how many numbers are listed and how many are skipped in each cycle to identify when we will reach the 500,000th number.\n\n### Exploring Patterns and Strategies\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence Construction:**\n\n   - On the 1st cycle (n=1), we list 4 numbers and skip 1.\n   - On the 2nd cycle (n=2), we list 5 numbers and skip 2.\n   - On the 3rd cycle (n=3), we list 6 numbers and skip 3.\n   - In the nth cycle, it appears we list \\(n+3\\) numbers and skip \\(n\\).\n\n   This pattern of listing and skipping suggests an iterative way of growing the list of numbers and spaces skipped.\n\n2. **Calculating Number of Terms in Each Cycle:**\n\n   - We need to compute how many numbers are listed after each cycle because the 500,000th number must fall somewhere within these cycles.\n\n   - For any cycle n:\n     - Numbers listed: \\( n(3) + \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\)\n     - Explanation: At each cycle, we're incrementally increasing numbers listed by \\( n+3 \\).\n\n3. **Finding Where the 500,000th Number Falls:**\n\n   Let's try calculating a few initial sums to see how these numbers play out:\n\n   - **Cycle 1:**\n     - Numbers listed: 4\n     - Total numbers listed after this cycle = 4\n\n   - **Cycle 2:**\n     - Numbers listed: 5 \n     - Cumulative total after this cycle: 4 + 5 = 9\n\n   - **Cycle 3:**\n     - Numbers listed: 6\n     - Cumulative total after this cycle: 9 + 6 = 15\n\n   - Continuing this way, it becomes apparent that calculating each cycle this way is possible but slow. I need a quicker computation method given the enormity of 500,000.\n\n4. **Developing a More Efficient Strategy:**\n\n   - Recognizing that this iterative pattern essentially forms an arithmetic sequence, I should find when the cumulative listed count reaches 500,000.\n\n   - Check the nth cycle configuration: The number listed in the nth cycle grows by one more than the previous cycle, suggesting the use of triangular number series properties could prove helpful here.\n\n5. **Reaching the 500,000th Number:**\n\n   - Utilization: There is an efficient relationship between the total numbers listed by the end of the nth cycle and solving this will help find n.\n   - Calculation will be structured around closed form for partial sums of such polynomial growths from the progression identified earlier.\n\n   Use the inequality: \\((n+3)\\cdot n/2 + 3n\\) to calculate this. Trial and error, combined with proper calculation or iteration, would provide the break down point.\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **Deduce Cumulative Listings:**\nGiven:\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{(n+4)(n+3)}{2} - \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\]\n\nSolve \\[ S_n = 500,000 \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Needed n:**\n\nThrough calculations or approximations (solving the quadratic or iterative process via binary), determine when cumulative count equals or surpasses 500,000. \n\n---\n\n**Check calculation**: Validate with known closed form solutions or iteratively within reasonable bounds if this results correctly fits within parameters of problem constraints.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFollowing verified calculations, you'll have n when the 500,000th number is reached, from which it is possible to compute and confirm which number corresponds to that position in the outlined sequence pattern.\n\n### Final Reflection\n\nGiven repeated steps leveraging cycles and progression, ensure calculation correctness through cross-verification - particularly on arithmetic patterns aligned with enumerative closure for sequences naturally arising from described processes.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous analysis, and it's crucial to re-evaluate the solution by revisiting and refining the approach. Let's delve into this once again and naturally progress towards the correct answer.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Approach\n\nIn my initial attempt, while I grasped the sequence's pattern, I didn't fully account for the precise mathematical derivation required to sync with the constraints effectively.\n\n1. **Reassessing the Pattern**:\n\n   Initially, we know that each cycle \\( n \\) involves listing \\( n + 3 \\) numbers and skipping \\( n \\). The overarching goal is to determine when the sequence reaches the 500,000th number.\n\n2. **Understanding Cumulative Count**:\n\n   - After \\( n \\) iterations, the total number of integers listed can be expressed as:\n\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (k + 3) = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + 3n\n     \\]\n\n   - Therefore, we can compute the cumulative count of listed numbers.\n\n### Calculating the Point of Interest\n\nTo find the cycle at which the 500,000th number appears, we need to equate the cumulative sum expression to 500,000:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + 3n = 500,000\n\\]\n\n3. **Determining When the Total Reaches 500,000**:\n\n   Solving this equation, we focus on estimating \\( n \\) through trial, error, and approximation:\n\n   - Focus on approximate calculations: Calculate values for different \\( n \\) to determine when the cumulative count surpasses 500,000.\n   - For large numbers, we might use numerical methods or simplifications to approximate or directly solve for \\( n \\).\n\n4. **Evaluating Iterations and Validation**:\n\n   Guessing \\( n \\) directly, I find that:\n\n   - For \\( n = 996 \\):\n\n     \\[\n     \\frac{996^2 + 7 \\cdot 996}{2} = 499,494\n     \\]\n\n   - After calculating, we see that 499,494 numbers are listed. Thus, we need 506 more numbers to reach 500,000.\n\n### Final Computation and Conclusion\n\n5. **Final Cycle Completion**:\n\n   Since we begin the 997th iteration, which involves listing 1,000 numbers, obtaining the 500,000th number is:\n\n   - Start from the last skipped integer from the 996th cycle: \n\n     \\[\n     996^2 + 4 \\cdot 996 = 996,000\n     \\]\n\n   - Add 506 to this, as we need 506 more numbers from this iteration:\n\n     - Hence, the 500,000th number is:\n\n       \\[\n       996,000 + 506 = \\boxed{996,506}\n       \\]\n\nThus, by revising and recalibrating the solution, we confirm that the 500,000th number in the sequence is indeed 996,506. It's always essential to double-check and refine strategies, ensuring alignment with the sequence's underlying mathematical structure.",
