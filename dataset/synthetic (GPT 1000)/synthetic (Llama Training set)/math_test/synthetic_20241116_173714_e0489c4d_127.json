    "working_out": "Alright, let's begin by diving into the problem of finding the largest prime factor of the number 78.\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nOkay, so I need to find the largest prime factor of 78. Prime factors are prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. I remember doing a similar exercise with smaller numbers in the past, where I had to break down numbers into their prime components. But since 78 is a bit larger, there could be a bit more work involved. Let's break 78 down to see what its prime factors are.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**  \n1. **Trial Division:** This is the process where I systematically test smaller numbers (starting from the smallest prime number) to see if they are factors.\n2. **Prime Factorization by Factor Tree:** This method involves breaking down the number into two factors repeatedly until all factors are prime numbers.\n3. **Checking divisibility rules:** This could also help in quickly finding smaller factors.\n\n**Approach:**\nLet's start with trial division since it seems like a straightforward method that will let me ease into the problem. Since 78 is an even number, I know it's divisible by 2, which is the smallest prime number.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculations:**\n\n1. **Check divisibility by 2:**  \n   - 78 \u00f7 2 = 39  \n   - So, 2 is a prime factor of 78.  \n\n2. **Now, work with 39:**  \n   - 39 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2. Let's try the next smallest prime number, which is 3.\n   - Sum of the digits of 39 is 3 + 9 = 12, which is divisible by 3.  \n   - 39 \u00f7 3 = 13  \n   - So, 3 is also a prime factor of 78.\n\n3. **Check 13:**  \n   - I know 13 is a prime number because it cannot be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.\n   - Therefore, 13 is another prime factor of 78.\n\n**Reflect & Verify:**  \nAlright, now I've identified the prime factors: 2, 3, and 13. Let's verify this:\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 13 = 78  \n- This checks out perfectly, confirming our factorization.\n\n**Identifying the Largest Prime Factor:**  \nLooking through our list of prime factors (2, 3, and 13), it's clear that 13 is the largest.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTherefore, the largest prime factor of 78 is 13.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nAlways good practice to double-check right at the end to catch any oversights. Our calculations are logical and verified, and factor multiplication gives us the original number. So, the answer is indeed correct.",
