    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. At first glance, the problem is asking for the number of zeros at the end of the product of three large factorials: \\(100!\\), \\(200!\\), and \\(300!\\). \n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nHaving zeros at the end of a number means that the number is divisible by 10. Each 10 is a product of 2 and 5. Typically, in factorials, there are plenty of twos, but fewer fives. So the number of zeros is determined by the number of times 5 appears in the factors of the number. This seems familiar; it's similar to problems I've done before where you count the factors of 5 in a factorial.\n\n### Step 2: Strategy Brainstorm\nSince the number of zeros at the end of a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 can be a factor, let's start there. \n- For \\(100!\\), we need to count the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n- Repeat this for \\(200!\\) and \\(300!\\).\n- Sum these results to get the total number of factors of 5 in \\((100!)(200!)(300!)\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculation for Each Factorial\n#### Compute the number of 5's in \\(100!\\):\n- 5s in \\(100\\): \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 20 \\)\n- 25s in \\(100\\): \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 4 \\)\n- 125s in \\(100\\): \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\)\n\nSo, total 5's in \\(100!\\) is \\(20 + 4 = 24\\).\n\n#### Compute the number of 5's in \\(200!\\):\n- 5s in \\(200\\): \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 40 \\)\n- 25s in \\(200\\): \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\)\n- 125s in \\(200\\): \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\)\n\nSo, total 5's in \\(200!\\) is \\(40 + 8 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n#### Compute the number of 5's in \\(300!\\):\n- 5s in \\(300\\): \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 60 \\)\n- 25s in \\(300\\): \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 12 \\)\n- 125s in \\(300\\): \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 2 \\)\n\nSo, total 5's in \\(300!\\) is \\(60 + 12 + 2 = 74\\).\n\n### Step 4: Sum the Results\nAdd up all the factors of 5:\n- \\(24\\) from \\(100!\\)\n- \\(49\\) from \\(200!\\)\n- \\(74\\) from \\(300!\\)\n\nTotal factors of 5: \\(24 + 49 + 74 = 147\\).\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Reflection\nReflecting on the solution, I believe counting the 5s is the correct approach since the number of 2s far exceeds the number of 5s in these large factorials. This ensures that each 5 can pair with a 2 to form a 10. \n\nThe total number of zeros in \\((100!)(200!)(300!)\\) is therefore \\(147\\). All calculations seem reasonable. The number follows the expected size for these factorials, and the methodology follows logically from the problem of counting trailing zeros.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe number of zeros at the end of \\((100!)(200!)(300!)\\) is 147.",

  "ground_truth": "The number of zeros at the end of a number is equivalent to the number of factors of 10 that number has. Since there are more factors of 2 than there are of 5 in a factorial, this is determined by the number of factors of 5. So, we go about computing this for each factorial separately.\n\nTo count the number of zeroes at the end of $100!$, we must count the number of factors of 5 in the product.  There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ multiples of 5 from 1 to 100. (The notation $\\left\\lfloor x\\right\\rfloor$ means the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, so basically, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ means \"divide 100 by 5 and round down.\")  This gives us 20 multiples of 5.  But the multiples of 25 contribute an additional factor of 5, so we have to add in the total number of multiples of 25, which gives us a total number of factors of 5 of $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 20+ 4 = 24$.\n\nSimilarly, for $200!$ the contributed zeros total $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 40 + 8 + 1 = 49$; and for $300!$, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 60 + 12 + 2 = 74$. So, our answer is $24 + 49 + 74 = \\boxed{147}$."
