    "working_out": "**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so Karla drove 12,000 miles last year. The problem is asking how many gallons of gasoline she could have saved by driving a hybrid car that gives 48 miles per gallon instead of an SUV that gives 15 miles per gallon. \n\nThis looks like a straightforward problem of comparing fuel consumption between two scenarios. I think I've done something similar with comparing fuel efficiencies before. Let's try to break it down.\n\n**Step 1 - Understanding the Problem:**\n\nFirst, I need to calculate how much gasoline the SUV used for 12,000 miles. Then, I'll do the same for the hybrid car. Finally, I'll find the difference between these two quantities to find out how much gasoline would be saved.\n\n**Step 2 - Calculate Gasoline Used by the SUV:**\n\nThe SUV averages 15 miles per gallon. So, to find out how many gallons of gasoline Karla needed for the SUV, I divide the total miles by the miles per gallon:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gallons used by SUV} = \\frac{12,000 \\text{ miles}}{15 \\text{ miles per gallon}} \\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12,000}{15} = 800 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nQuick check: 12,000 divided by 15 feels right for an SUV that has low fuel efficiency. That makes some sense for a whole year of driving.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate Gasoline Used by the Hybrid Car:**\n\nThe hybrid averages 48 miles per gallon. So, I use the same method:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gallons used by Hybrid} = \\frac{12,000 \\text{ miles}}{48 \\text{ miles per gallon}} \\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12,000}{48} = 250 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nAgain, a quick check: 12,000 divided by 48 feels right for a hybrid car. Less fuel usage compared to the SUV fits my expectations.\n\n**Step 4 - Calculate the Gasoline Savings:**\n\nFinally, subtract the gallons used by the hybrid from the gallons used by the SUV to find the savings:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gasoline Saved} = 800 \\text{ gallons} - 250 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Gasoline Saved} = 550 \\text{ gallons} \\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThe hybrid would have saved 550 gallons of gasoline compared to the SUV over the course of 12,000 miles. This fits my understanding since hybrids are generally much more fuel-efficient. The calculations all seem solid, and the quick checks along the way confirmed my approach. \n\nI feel confident in this answer: Karla would have saved 550 gallons by driving the hybrid.",

  "ground_truth": "Karla used $12000/15 = 800$ gallons to drive 12000 miles. Had she driven the hybrid, she would have used $12000/48 = 250$ gallons. Therefore, she would have saved $800 - 250 = \\boxed{550}$ gallons."
