    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. This question is asking us to find the remainder when the polynomial \\(3y^4 - 4y^3 + 5y^2 - 13y + 4\\) is divided by a linear polynomial \\(3y - 2\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question and Initial Thoughts\n\nFirst, we want to understand what the problem asks. We have a polynomial division problem, and we need to find the remainder. I immediately think of the division algorithm for polynomials, which states that if \\(f(y)\\) is divided by a polynomial \\(d(y)\\), we can express it as:\n\n\\[ f(y) = (d(y) \\cdot q(y)) + r(y) \\]\n\nwhere \\(q(y)\\) is the quotient and \\(r(y)\\) is the remainder. Here, we'll find \\(r(y)\\) when \\(3y - 2\\) divides the given polynomial.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Potential Strategies\n\n1. **Long Division:** This involves dividing the polynomials directly, similar to number division. It often involves tedious calculations.\n\n2. **Synthetic Division:** Given that we have a linear divisor, synthetic division might simplify our work, but it's typically used when the divisor is of the form \\(y - a\\).\n\n3. **Remainder Theorem:** This could be useful here because it states that the remainder of the division of a polynomial \\(f(y)\\) by \\(y - a\\) is simply \\(f(a)\\). However, our divisor isn't in that form, which complicates things slightly.\n\nSo far, I'm inclined towards using a modified approach of synthetic division or the Remainder Theorem by adjusting the linear term.\n\n### Step 3: Adjusted Remainder Theorem Approach\n\nWait! The Remainder Theorem can still be useful if we transform our divisor. The divisor \\(3y - 2\\) can be rewritten as \\(3(y - \\frac{2}{3})\\). In this form, I could apply the Remainder Theorem by evaluating the polynomial at \\(y = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nLet's compute \\(f\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\) to find the remainder directly, considering the divisor's effect.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating \\(f\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\)\n\nThe polynomial is \\(f(y) = 3y^4 - 4y^3 + 5y^2 - 13y + 4\\).\n\nSubstitute \\(y = \\frac{2}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 3\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 - 4\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 + 5\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 - 13\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) + 4\n\\]\n\nLet me calculate each term carefully:\n\n- The first term: \\(3\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 = 3 \\cdot \\frac{16}{81} = \\frac{48}{81}\\)\n\n- The second term: \\(-4\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = -4 \\cdot \\frac{8}{27} = -\\frac{32}{27}\\)\n\n- The third term: \\(5\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = 5 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{20}{9}\\)\n\n- The fourth term: \\(-13\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{26}{3}\\)\n\n- The constant term: \\(+ 4 = \\frac{12}{3}\\)\n\n### Step 5: Simplifying the Calculation\n\nNow, I'll need to combine these fractions. Let's convert them to have a common denominator (81 or appropriately scaled).\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{48}{81} - \\frac{96}{81} + \\frac{180}{81} - \\frac{702}{81} + \\frac{324}{81}\n\\]\n\nCombining these:\n\n- \\(\\frac{48 - 96 + 180 - 702 + 324}{81} = \\frac{48 + 180 + 324 - 96 - 702}{81}\\)\n- \\(= \\frac{552 - 798}{81} = \\frac{-246}{81}\\)\n\nSimplify \\(-\\frac{246}{81}\\):\n\n- \\(-\\frac{246}{81}\\) reduces to \\(-\\frac{82}{27}\\) after dividing by 3.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe remainder when \\(3y^4 - 4y^3 + 5y^2 - 13y + 4\\) is divided by \\(3y - 2\\) is \\(-\\frac{82}{27}\\).\n\nFinal reflection: The result seems consistent given steps and calculations. Polynomial division checks out with Remainder Theorem applied effectively using transformations, emphasizing the process's validity and adaptability.",
