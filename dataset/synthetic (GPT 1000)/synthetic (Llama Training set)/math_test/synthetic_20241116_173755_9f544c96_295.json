    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem about triangle \\(LMN\\). I'll write this out as if I'm genuinely thinking through it, with all the steps, backtracking and insights included. \n\n### First Thoughts\n\nWhen I first read the question, I notice that it\u2019s a right triangle problem. We have a right angle at \\(\\angle M\\), which immediately makes me think of the Pythagorean theorem. I also note the need to find \\(\\sin L\\), which relates to opposite and hypotenuse sides in trigonometry. The given side lengths \\(MN = 2\\) and \\(LM = \\sqrt{21}\\) point to using the Pythagorean theorem to find \\(LN\\).\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n1. **Pythagorean Theorem**: First strategy is using the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side. Since \\(\\angle M\\) is the right angle, \\(LN\\) is the hypotenuse, while \\(LM\\) and \\(MN\\) are the legs. The theorem says: \n   \\[\n   LN^2 = LM^2 + MN^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Trigonometry Definitions**: Focus on what \\(\\sin L\\) is. The formula for \\(\\sin\\) in a right triangle is:\n   \\[\n   \\sin L = \\frac{\\text{opposite side to } L}{\\text{hypotenuse}}\n   \\]\n\nGreat, I have a plan! Use the Pythagorean theorem to find \\(LN\\), then use the definition of \\(\\sin\\) to find \\(\\sin L\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Solutions\n\n**Step 1: Applying Pythagorean Theorem**\n\n- Given:\n  - \\(LM = \\sqrt{21}\\)\n  - \\(MN = 2\\)\n  \nI need to calculate \\(LN\\):\n\n\\[\nLN^2 = (\\sqrt{21})^2 + 2^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\nLN^2 = 21 + 4 = 25\n\\]\n\nHmm\u2026 Let\u2019s see, the square of 5 is 25, so:\n\n\\[\nLN = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n\\]\n\nQuick reflection: This seems right. \\(\\angle M\\) is the right angle, so it makes sense that \\(LN\\) is the hypotenuse and it would be larger than either \\(LM\\) or \\(MN\\).\n\n**Step 2: Calculating \\(\\sin L\\)**\n\nNow I need to find \\(\\sin L\\). Looking at triangle \\(\\triangle LMN\\), with:\n- \\(LM\\) as the opposite side to \\(\\angle L\\),\n- \\(LN\\) as the hypotenuse.\n\n\\[\n\\sin L = \\frac{LM}{LN} = \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Final Check and Reflection\n\n- **Check Size and Signs**: Both sides agree with the relative sizes of triangle sides.\n- **Check if \\(LN\\) acts logically as the hypotenuse**: Yes, it is indeed the largest side.\n- **Sense check on \\(\\sin L\\)**: \\(\\sin\\) values should be between 0 and 1, and \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}\\) fits this.\n  \nLooks good! This result seems logical given the context and constraints of trigonometry in a right-angled triangle.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\sin L = \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out numerically and conceptually. I\u2019m happy with this solution!\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculations. Let me go through the problem again and correct my solution by integrating new ideas and approaches.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Solution\n\nUpon re-examining the problem, I realize I need to refocus on finding \\(\\sin L\\) using the correct sides of the triangle. My earlier mistake was incorrectly identifying which side is opposite \\(\\angle L\\). Let's correct this by going through the steps again.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n- **Revisiting Triangle Configuration**: In \\(\\triangle LMN\\) with \\(\\angle M = 90^\\circ\\), \\(LN\\) is indeed the hypotenuse, \\(LM = \\sqrt{21}\\) and \\(MN = 2\\) are the legs. Upon reflection, to find \\(\\sin L\\), I should have considered \\(MN\\), not \\(LM\\), as the opposite side to \\(\\angle L\\).\n\n- **Using Trigonometric Definition**: The correct formulation for \\(\\sin L\\) should be:\n  \\[\n  \\sin L = \\frac{\\text{opposite side to } L}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{MN}{LN}\n  \\]\n\n### Solutions Re-Exploration\n\n**Step 1: Recheck Pythagorean Theorem Calculation**\n\nConfirming earlier calculations for \\(LN\\), as they seemed correct:\n\\[\nLN^2 = LM^2 + MN^2 = (\\sqrt{21})^2 + 2^2 = 21 + 4 = 25\n\\]\n\\[\nLN = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Correcting \\(\\sin L\\) Calculation**\n\nThe correct calculation for \\(\\sin L\\) becomes:\n- \\(MN\\) as the opposite side to \\(\\angle L\\),\n- \\(LN\\) as the hypotenuse.\n\n\\[\n\\sin L = \\frac{MN}{LN} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Final Reflection\n\n- **Verification**: I confirmed that the components of the triangle align with trigonometric definitions. Previously, I had mistaken which side was opposite to \\(\\angle L\\), leading to the wrong ratio.\n- **Checking the Value**: The result \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) fits within the expected range for \\(\\sin\\) values, between 0 and 1.\n- **Conceptual Confirmation**: The logic behind the calculation is now consistent with the properties of right triangles.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\sin L = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\nHaving double-checked both the mathematical steps and the conceptual understanding, I feel confident in this revised solution.",
