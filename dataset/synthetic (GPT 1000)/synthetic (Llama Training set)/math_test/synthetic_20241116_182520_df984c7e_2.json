    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The equation given is \\(192x^2 - 16 = 0\\), and we need to find the value of \\(\\frac{1}{x^4}\\).\n\nFirst thoughts: \n\n- This equation looks like a quadratic equation. I recognize that because of the \\(x^2\\) term. \n- My initial thought is to solve for \\(x^2\\) by isolating it on one side. Once I have \\(x^2\\), I should be able to use that to find \\(\\frac{1}{x^4}\\). \n- Hmm, \\(\\frac{1}{x^4}\\) is the reciprocal of \\(x^4\\), so once I find \\(x^2\\), I can square it to get \\(x^4\\) and then take the reciprocal. This seems like a good approach.\n\nLet's start solving the equation step by step:\n\n1. **Isolate \\(x^2\\):**\n   \\[\n   192x^2 - 16 = 0\n   \\]\n   To isolate \\(x^2\\), I should add 16 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   192x^2 = 16\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(x^2\\):**\n   Divide both sides of the equation by 192 to solve for \\(x^2\\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 = \\frac{16}{192}\n   \\]\n\n   - Wait, I should simplify \\(\\frac{16}{192}\\). Both 16 and 192 are divisible by 16.\n   - So, divide the numerator and the denominator by 16:\n     \\[\n     x^2 = \\frac{16 \\div 16}{192 \\div 16} = \\frac{1}{12}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\(x^4\\):**\n   Now, I want to find \\(x^4\\), which is \\((x^2)^2\\):\n   \\[\n   x^4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{144}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find \\(\\frac{1}{x^4}\\):**\n   Since I need \\(\\frac{1}{x^4}\\), I should take the reciprocal of \\(x^4\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{x^4} = 144\n   \\]\n\n- Let's pause and check if this feels right:\n  - I found \\(x^2 = \\frac{1}{12}\\). Squaring it indeed gives \\(\\frac{1}{144}\\).\n  - Taking the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{1}{144}\\) gives 144. So, everything checks out.\n\nThis approach seems correct. Let's conclude:\n\nThe value of \\(\\frac{1}{x^4}\\) is \\(144\\). \n\nReflecting on the process:\n\n- Overall, this was pretty straightforward. The key was to isolate \\(x^2\\) and then work my way to finding \\(\\frac{1}{x^4}\\).\n- No shifts in strategy were needed since the plan followed through logically from start to end. \n- It's satisfying when the calculation confirms the expected reciprocal relationship, showing 144 as the outcome, which feels reasonable.",
