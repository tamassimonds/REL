    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into the problem step by step.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\n- The question asks for the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of a line. The line has a slope of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and passes through the point $(2, -3)$.\n- When I first read the problem, I immediately think of the point-slope form of a line, which is \\( y = mx + b \\) where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( b \\) is the $y$-intercept.\n- Hmm, I know I need to find the $y$-intercept \\( b \\). Since I have a point (2, -3) and the slope \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), I can probably use this information to find \\( b \\).\n\n### Start with the Equation\n\n1. **Consider the Equation of a Line**: The slope-intercept form is \\( y = mx + b \\).\n   - Here, \\( m = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n   - We need to find \\( b \\), so we'll use the point (2, -3) to solve for it.\n\n2. **Plug in the Point**:\n   - Substitute the point (2, -3) into the equation. \n   - Set \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = -3 \\).\n\n3. **Formulate the Equation**:\n   \\[\n   -3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(2) + b\n   \\]\n   - Simplify it to solve for \\( b \\). From here, I need to calculate step by step.\n\n4. **Calculate**:\n   \\[\n   -3 = 1 + b\n   \\]\n   - Subtract 1 from both sides to isolate \\( b \\).\n   \\[\n   -3 - 1 = b \\implies b = -4\n   \\]\n\n### Double-Check and Reflect\n\n- Let's go over it again to ensure everything makes sense. I plugged in the point into the equation: \\(-3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 + b\\). This simplifies to \\( -3 = 1 + b \\). Subtracting 1 from both sides, I indeed get \\( b = -4 \\).\n- Reflecting on the logic, everything checks out. The operations were straightforward for finding \\( b \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept is \\(-4\\).\n- Ultimately, the key was using the point-slope formula correctly and plugging in the details we were given!\n\nThus, the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the line is \\(\\boxed{-4}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "A point-slope form of the equation is \\[y - (-3) = \\frac{1}{2}(x-2).\\]Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $2(y+3) = x-2$, and rearranging this gives $x - 2y =8$.  Letting $x=0$ and solving for $y$ gives us the desired $y$-coordinate of $\\boxed{-4}$."
