    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The equation we're examining is \\(x^2 = 2x + 2y - 3\\). We're trying to determine which type of conic section this equation represents.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- When I see \\(x^2\\) on one side, it reminds me of typical parabola equations that have one squared term. \n- Other conic sections like ellipses and hyperbolas usually start with both \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\) terms balanced or structured similarly, perhaps with different coefficients.\n\n**Strategy Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation:** It might help to rearrange the equation to see if it fits a standard conic section form.\n2. **Examine Terms:** Look for the presence or absence of \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\) terms to help identify the conic type.\n3. **Complete the Square:** Completing the square can often clarify the type by placing it in a recognizable form.\n\n**Step-by-Step Exploration:**\n\n1. **Rearranging the Equation:**\n   - Start with: \\(x^2 = 2x + 2y - 3\\).\n   - Move all terms to one side: \\(x^2 - 2x - 2y + 3 = 0\\).\n\n2. **Look for Familiar Patterns:**\n   - Notice there is only one squared term, \\(x^2\\), which suggests a parabola. If it were a circle, ellipse, or hyperbola, there would be a \\(y^2\\) term as well.\n\n3. **Complete the Square:**\n   - To see the vertex form of the parabola:\n   - Start with the \\(x\\) terms: \\(x^2 - 2x\\).\n   - Complete the square: Take half of \\(-2\\), which is \\(-1\\), square it to get \\(1\\), and adjust the equation: \n     \\[(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 1 - 2y + 3 = 0\\]\n   - Simplify: \\((x - 1)^2 - 2y + 2 = 0\\).\n   - Rearrange to get \\(y\\) by itself: \\((x - 1)^2 = 2y - 2\\) or \\(y = \\frac{1}{2}(x - 1)^2 + 1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Checks:** \n  - The resulting equation \\(y = \\frac{1}{2}(x - 1)^2 + 1\\) is clearly the equation of a parabola, as it fits the form \\(y = a(x - h)^2 + k\\).\n  - The absence of \\(y^2\\) confirms it's not a circle, ellipse, or hyperbola. \n\n- **Conclusion:** \n  - The equation describes a parabola.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n- \"P\" for parabola. \n\nIn summary, my exploration confirmed the initial suspicion that the presence of only one squared term \\(x^2\\) and rearranging the equation to a standard parabola form proved it well. No need to check further for other types as the configuration aligns exactly with a parabola.",
