    "working_out": "First, let\u2019s try to understand the problem. We have a 12-hour analog clock, and when it reads 8:00, the minute hand is at the 12, and the hour hand is at the 8. The problem asks for the smaller angle formed between these two hands.\n\n### Brainstorming Possible Approaches\n\n1. **Divide and Subtraction Strategy:**\n   - An angle is formed at the clock center by the hour and minute hands.\n   - Calculate the exact positions of each hand in degree terms.\n   - Find the absolute difference between their values.\n\n2. **Calculate Directly:**\n   - Understand each hour represents 30\u00b0 (360\u00b0 divided by 12 hours).\n   - Calculate position of the hour hand: shift it by 8 positions.\n   - Minute hand should be at the top (0\u00b0).\n   - Difference gives the answer.\n\n3. **Formulaic Approach:**\n   - Use the formula for angle between hands: \\( |30h - 5.5m| \\).\n   - For 8:00, substitute \\( h = 8\\) and \\( m = 0\\).\n\n**Hmm, the Divide and Subtraction seems clear and direct. Let's pursue this approach first.**\n\n### Execute the Strategy\n\n1. **Position of Hour Hand:**\n   - Each hour represents \\(30\u00b0\\).\n   - At 8:00, the hour hand is at \\(8 \\times 30\u00b0 = 240\u00b0\\).\n\n2. **Position of Minute Hand:**\n   - The minute hand at 60 minutes would be at 360\u00b0.\n   - However, at 0 minutes past any hour, it\u2019s at 0\u00b0.\n\n3. **Calculate the Angle:**\n   - The difference: \\(|240\u00b0 - 0\u00b0| = 240\u00b0\\).\n\n### Verify and Clarify\n\nWait, 240\u00b0 seems large. Let\u2019s check the rule for smaller angle:\n- **Smaller angle condition:** If angle > 180\u00b0, subtract from 360\u00b0.\n\nSo, the smaller angle \\( = 360\u00b0 - 240\u00b0 = 120\u00b0\\).\n\n### Re-evaluate Strategy\n\nAha, it seems our direct calculation is correct. Let's also double check with the formulaic check:\n\n**Using the Already Stated Formula (Double-Check):**\n\n- The formula is \\( |30h - 5.5m| \\).\n- Plug in \\( h = 8 \\), \\( m = 0 \\).\n- Calculation: \\( |30 \\times 8 - 5.5 \\times 0| = |240 - 0| = 240\u00b0\\), smaller angle: \\(360\u00b0 - 240\u00b0 = 120\u00b0\\).\n\n### Final Thoughts and Conclusion\n\nThat makes sense. Both approaches confirm that the smaller angle is indeed \\(120\u00b0\\). It feels good to have gone through different strategies and validated our steps.\n\nAlways feels rewarding to put thinking process in clear words. Let's be mindful of conversion strategies, ensuring the smaller angle is the outcome \u2014 constant checks helped catch this potential slip.\n\n**Answer:** The degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the minute and hour hands at 8:00 is \\(120\u00b0\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The hour hand is at $8$ and the minute hand is at $12$, which span 4 hours.  Each hour on the 12-hour analog clock spans $360/12=30$ degrees, so the angle formed here is $30\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{120}$ degrees."
