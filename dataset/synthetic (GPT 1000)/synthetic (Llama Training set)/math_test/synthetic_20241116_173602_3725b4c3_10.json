    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The goal is to determine for how many positive integer values of \\( n \\), the expression \\( 3^n \\) is a factor of \\( 15! \\). Here, \\( 15! \\) denotes factorial of 15, which is the product of all positive integers up to 15.\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- This problem seems like something I've encountered before in number theory. It reminds me of calculating the highest power of a prime number that divides a factorial.\n- The question is about finding \\( n \\) such that \\( 3^n \\), a power of 3, divides \\( 15! \\). So, it seems clear that we're looking at the highest power of 3 that divides \\( 15! \\).\n- I recall there's a specific method for this involving division in steps.\n\nInitial Strategy:\n- Let's consider using the formula for the highest power of a prime \\( p \\) in \\( n! \\). This formula is:\n  \\[\n  \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^k} \\right\\rfloor\n  \\]\n  where \\( p \\) is the prime, and \\( n \\) is the number for the factorial.\n\nPlan:\n1. Identify \\( n = 15 \\) and \\( p = 3 \\) for this scenario.\n2. Compute the sum according to the formula.\n3. Keep track of each step, checking correctness as I go.\n\nStep-by-step Execution and Reflection:\n1. **Calculate \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{15}{3} \\right\\rfloor \\):**\n   - \\(\\frac{15}{3} = 5\\)\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor 5 \\right\\rfloor = 5\\)\n   - This suggests there are 5 multiples of 3 up to 15.\n\n2. **Calculate \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{15}{9} \\right\\rfloor \\):**\n   - \\(\\frac{15}{9} = 1.666...\\)\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor 1.666... \\right\\rfloor = 1\\)\n   - This indicates there's 1 multiple of 9 up to 15.\n\n3. **Calculate \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{15}{27} \\right\\rfloor \\):**\n   - \\(\\frac{15}{27} \\approx 0.555...\\)\n   - \\(\\left\\lfloor 0.555... \\right\\rfloor = 0\\)\n   - No multiples of 27 up to 15.\n\n4. **Sum these values together:**\n   - \\(5 + 1 + 0 = 6\\)\n\nFinal Thoughts and Verification:\n- The calculation \\(5 + 1 + 0 = 6\\) makes sense. We calculated the contribution from powers of \\(3\\), \\(9\\), and higher powers like \\(27\\) did not contribute because they're too large for \\( n = 15 \\).\n- The sum of the highest powers from each step tells us that the greatest \\( n \\) for which \\( 3^n \\) divides \\( 15! \\) is indeed 6.\n- Comprehensive checks of each component led to a consistent result, confirming the strategy and calculations are sound.\n\nConclusion:\n- The highest power of 3 which divides into \\( 15! \\) is \\( 3^6 \\). Therefore, there are 6 positive integer values of \\( n \\) such that \\( 3^n \\) is a factor of \\( 15! \\).\n- My final answer is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We first determine the largest positive integer value of $n$ such that $3^n | 15!$. We determine this by counting the number of factors of 3 in the product.  There are 5 multiples of 3 in the product, and there is one extra factor of 3 in 9, so there are a total of  $5+ 1 = \\boxed{6}$ factors of 3 in the product of the first 15 integers. So, for all $n$ between 1 and 6, inclusive, $3^n$ is a factor of 15!."
