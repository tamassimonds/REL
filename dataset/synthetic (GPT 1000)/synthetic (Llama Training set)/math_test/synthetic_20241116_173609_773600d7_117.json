    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Looking at the equation:\n\n\\[\n(2^x - 2)(5 \\cdot 2^x + 10) = 3 \\cdot 4^x + 12\n\\]\n\nFirst thoughts: This looks like it might involve exponential manipulation. I'm inclined to start by simplifying both sides of the equation. Notice that \\(4^x\\) can be written as \\((2^2)^x\\) which simplifies to \\((2^x)^2\\). This may help in transforming the right side to something easier to manage. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the components**:\n   - The left side involves two expressions multiplied together: \\((2^x - 2)\\) and \\((5 \\cdot 2^x + 10)\\).\n   - The right side is \\(3 \\cdot 4^x + 12\\), which suggests it can be simplified in terms of base \\(2\\).\n\n2. **Express \\(4^x\\) in terms of \\(2^x\\)**:\n   \\[\n   4^x = (2^2)^x = (2^x)^2\n   \\]\n   This is an important transformation because it ties everything back to the base \\(2\\).\n\n3. **Expand the left side**:\n   \\[\n   (2^x - 2)(5 \\cdot 2^x + 10) = (2^x - 2)(5 \\cdot 2^x) + (2^x - 2)(10)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the individual terms**:\n   \\[\n   (2^x - 2)(5 \\cdot 2^x) = 5 \\cdot 2^{2x} - 10 \\cdot 2^x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (2^x - 2)(10) = 10 \\cdot 2^x - 20\n   \\]\n\n5. **Combine the expanded left side**:\n   \\[\n   5 \\cdot 2^{2x} - 10 \\cdot 2^x + 10 \\cdot 2^x - 20 = 5 \\cdot 2^{2x} - 20\n   \\]\n\n6. **Set up the equation**:\n   - Now, the equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     5 \\cdot 2^{2x} - 20 = 3 \\cdot 4^x + 12\n     \\]\n   - Express \\(4^x\\) as \\((2^x)^2\\):\n     \\[\n     3 \\cdot (2^x)^2 + 12\n     \\]\n\n7. **Equate both sides**:\n   \\[\n   5 \\cdot 2^{2x} - 20 = 3 \\cdot (2^x)^2 + 12\n   \\]\n\n8. **Simplify further**:\n   - Subtract \\(3(2^x)^2\\) from both sides:\n     \\[\n     5(2^x)^2 - 3(2^x)^2 = 32\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     2(2^x)^2 = 32\n     \\]\n\n9. **Solve for \\(2^x\\)**:\n   \\[\n   (2^x)^2 = 16\n   \\]\n   - Taking square roots gives:\n     \\[\n     2^x = 4\n     \\]\n\n10. **Find \\(x\\)**:\n    - Since \\(2^2 = 4\\), we have:\n      \\[\n      x = 2\n      \\]\n\n11. **Check the solution**:\n    - Substitute \\(x = 2\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies both sides.\n\n   \\[\n   (2^2 - 2)(5 \\cdot 2^2 + 10) = 3 \\cdot 4^2 + 12\n   \\]\n   - Evaluate each side:\n   \\[\n   (4 - 2)(20) = 3 \\cdot 16 + 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2 \\cdot 20 = 48 + 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   40 = 60 - 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   40 = 40\n   \\]\n\nReflections: Breaking down the problem step by step really helped clarify the pathway to the solution. My initial intuition worked well when equating powers of the same base. Mistakes in calculations could easily have thrown this off, so verifying step-by-step ensured accuracy.\n\nFinal answer: \\(x = 2\\).",
