    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with a fresh mind and explore our options.\n\n### First Thoughts\nWhen I first look at the problem, I'm drawn to the two equations provided: \n\n1. \\(2a + 4b = 5\\)\n2. \\(a = 3b\\)\n\nHmm, this reminds me of systems of equations I've solved in the past. It seems that these equations might be interdependent, given that one equation involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) directly, while the other equation gives a direct relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n1. **Substitution:** Since I have \\(a = 3b\\), maybe I can substitute \\(3b\\) for \\(a\\) in the first equation. This might simplify things and possibly allow me to solve it directly for \\(b\\).\n\n2. **Elimination:** I could also consider manipulating these equations such that I eliminate one of the variables, though substitution seems more straightforward in this particular setup.\n\n3. **Checking Units/Scales:** Sometimes it's useful to check if any additional information can be extracted from the nature or scale of numbers, but in this case, the numbers seem pretty ordinary.\n\nAlright, let's try substitution first.\n\n### Substitution Approach\n- We know from the second equation: \\(a = 3b\\)\n- Substitute \\(a = 3b\\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\n2(3b) + 4b = 5\n\\]\n\n- This simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n6b + 4b = 5\n\\]\n\n- Which further simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n10b = 5\n\\]\n\n- Solving for \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nI'm going to pause here and check this calculation because if \\(b\\) is incorrect, everything else falls apart. \\(b = \\frac{1}{2}\\) seems reasonable given the simplicity of calculations.\n\n### Plug Back to Find \\(a\\)\nNow that I have \\(b\\), I can easily find \\(a\\) using \\(a = 3b\\):\n\n\\[\na = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Calculate \\(3a\\)\nThe problem ultimately asks for \\(3a\\), so let's calculate that:\n\n\\[\n3a = 3 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{9}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nI believe these calculations hold up, but it's always worth doing a quick reality check:\n\n- The value for \\(b\\) was deduced cleanly, and substituting back into both equations generally makes sense.\n- The whole process followed logical steps, and the solution \\(\\frac{9}{2}\\) for \\(3a\\) matches expectations derived from correct inputs.\n\nThus, the answer is reasonably accurate, and I'm confident that \\(3a = \\frac{9}{2}\\) is indeed the correct solution here.",

  "ground_truth": "First we begin by solving the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n2a+4b&=5, \\\\\n3b&=a.\n\\end{align*}Making the substitution for $a$ from the second equation to the first, we get $2(3b)+4b=5$, which simplifies to $10b=5$. Solving for $b$, we find that $b=\\frac{1}{2}$. Plugging this into the second equation above, we obtain $a=3\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$. Hence $3a=3\\cdot \\frac{3}{2}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}}$."
