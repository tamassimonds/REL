    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step and really explore different strategies. \n\n### First Thoughts\n\n- When I first look at this problem, it reminds me of a classic system of equations problem. I think I've done something similar before in algebra class.\n- The sum of two numbers and their difference gives us two equations, which usually indicates the elimination method or substitution method could work well.\n- But let's explore this further to see if there's a straightforward way to solve it.\n\n### Initial Brainstorming\n\n#### Strategy 1: Setting up Equations\n\n1. **Equations from Problem Statement**:\n   - The sum of the two numbers is 25: Let's call the numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). So, \\( x + y = 25 \\).\n   - The difference of the two numbers is 11: This gives us \\( x - y = 11 \\).\n\n2. **Checking if these Equations Make Sense**:\n   - Whenever I set up equations, I like to quickly verify that they match the problem statement. Here, everything seems correct because the translation from words to symbols seems accurate.\n\n#### Strategy 2: Elimination Method\n\n3. **The Elimination Approach**:\n   - To eliminate one of the variables, I could add the two equations:\n     \\[\n     (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying this gives me \\( 2x = 36 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( x \\): \\( x = 18 \\).\n\n4. **Substituting \\( x \\) Back in to Find \\( y \\)**:\n   - Using \\( x + y = 25 \\):\n     - Substitute \\( x = 18 \\) into \\( x + y = 25 \\):\n     \\[\n     18 + y = 25\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( y \\): \\( y = 25 - 18 = 7 \\).\n\n5. **Check the Solution**:\n   - Now that I have \\( x = 18 \\) and \\( y = 7 \\), let's quickly check:\n     - The sum \\( 18 + 7 = 25 \\) checks out.\n     - The difference \\( 18 - 7 = 11 \\) also checks out.\n   - This confirms that my approach and answer seem correct.\n\n### Reflection and Final Answer\n\n- Through this process, it seems that solving the system of equations using elimination was quite straightforward.\n- The steps all logically followed each other, and my quick checks at the end confirm that the solution satisfies both original conditions.\n- Thus, the smaller of the two numbers is \\( y = 7 \\).\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n- It was nice to see everything click together smoothly\u2014sort of an \"oh, there it is!\" moment when both the sum and difference conditions reconciled.\n- I didn't need to try the substitution method or any other elaborate strategy this time around since elimination worked efficiently.\n\nSo, the smaller of the two numbers is **7**.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x,y$ be the two numbers, $x>y$. Then $x+y=25$ and $x-y=11$, thus:\n\n$y=\\frac{1}{2}\\left((x+y)-(x-y)\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}(25-11)=\\boxed{7}$."
