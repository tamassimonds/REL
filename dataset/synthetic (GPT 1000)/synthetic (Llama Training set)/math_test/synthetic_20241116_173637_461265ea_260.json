    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this inequality step-by-step, embracing both clarity and any quirky realizations along the way.\n\n**First Thoughts and Initial Observations:**\n\n- The inequality given is \\(\\frac{x(x + 1)^2}{x - 7} \\le 0\\).\n- It involves a rational expression, which usually means I need to consider when the numerator is zero or changes sign, and when the denominator is zero or changes sign.\n- I've definitely encountered similar problems before, where I need to find the intervals on the number line that satisfy such an inequality. \n\n**Strategy Brainstorming:**\n\n- A key approach in dealing with rational inequalities is identifying critical points: zeros of the numerator and points where the denominator is zero (which are typically vertical asymptotes in a graph).\n- I'll start by finding where the numerator and the denominator are zero since those will be my test points to split the number line into intervals.\n\n**Step-by-step Execution:**\n\n1. **Find Zeros of the Numerator:**\n   - The numerator is \\(x(x + 1)^2\\).\n   - Set it equal to zero: \\(x(x + 1)^2 = 0\\).\n   - Solutions are:\n     - \\(x = 0\\), because of the factor \\(x\\).\n     - \\(x = -1\\), because of the factor \\((x + 1)^2\\).\n   - So, the critical points from the numerator are \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = -1\\).\n\n2. **Find Zeros of the Denominator:**\n   - The denominator is \\(x - 7\\).\n   - Set it equal to zero: \\(x - 7 = 0\\).\n   - Solution is \\(x = 7\\).\n\n3. **Critical Points:**\n   - We have critical points at \\(x = -1\\), \\(x = 0\\), and \\(x = 7\\).\n   - These critical points split the number line into four intervals: \\((-\\infty, -1)\\), \\((-1, 0)\\), \\((0, 7)\\), and \\((7, \\infty)\\).\n\n4. **Test Intervals:**\n   - I\u2019ll choose a test point in each of these intervals to check the sign of the expression.\n\n   **Interval \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\):**\n   - Test point: \\(x = -2\\).\n   - Evaluate: \\(\\frac{(-2)((-2) + 1)^2}{-2 - 7} = \\frac{-2 \\times 1}{-9} = \\frac{2}{9}\\).\n   - This is positive, so \\((- \\infty, -1)\\) does not satisfy the inequality.\n\n   **Interval \\( (-1, 0) \\):**\n   - Test point: \\(x = -0.5\\).\n   - Evaluate: \\(\\frac{-0.5((-0.5) + 1)^2}{-0.5 - 7} = \\frac{-0.5 \\times 0.25}{-7.5}\\).\n   - This gives a positive value, meaning that \\((-1, 0)\\) does not satisfy the inequality.\n\n   **Interval \\( (0, 7) \\):**\n   - Test point: \\(x = 1\\).\n   - Evaluate: \\(\\frac{1(1 + 1)^2}{1 - 7} = \\frac{1 \\times 4}{-6} = -\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n   - This is negative, so \\((0, 7)\\) satisfies the inequality.\n\n   **Interval \\( (7, \\infty) \\):**\n   - Test point: \\(x = 8\\).\n   - Evaluate: \\(\\frac{8(8 + 1)^2}{8 - 7} = \\frac{8 \\times 81}{1}\\), which is positive.\n   - This means \\((7, \\infty)\\) does not satisfy the inequality.\n\n5. **Consider Boundaries:**\n   - At \\(x = 0\\), the numerator is zero, making \\(\\frac{0(x + 1)^2}{x - 7} = 0\\), which satisfies the inequality.\n   - At \\(x = 7\\), the expression is undefined (division by zero), so \\(x = 7\\) itself is not in the solution set.\n   - At \\(x = -1\\), the expression is zero, which satisfies the inequality.\n\n6. **Solution in Interval Notation:**\n   - Gather the intervals where the inequality holds: \\([-1, 0] \\cup (0, 7)\\).\n   \nReflecting back on the solution, everything seems consistent. The sign changes at the points I expected, and the results from plugging test points make sense given the problem. This feels like a solid and correct approach. Aha! I\u2019m confident with the solution. \n\nFinal Answer: \\([-1, 0] \\cup (0, 7)\\).\n\nAh, I see! Let's revisit this problem with a fresh perspective and tweak my previous solution. I appreciate the subtle nuances of mathematics that often reveal the path to the correct answer. Let's dive back into the inequality: \\(\\frac{x(x + 1)^2}{x - 7} \\leq 0\\).\n\n**Reflection and Reevaluation:**\n\nWhile I initially calculated the critical points and tested the intervals, it's important to consider the nature of the expression \\((x + 1)^2\\), which is non-negative for all \\(x\\). This means it doesn't affect the sign of the expression, simplifying our evaluation.\n\nLet's explore my previous intervals with this in mind and re-evaluate the sign chart:\n\n1. **Numerator and Denominator Analysis:**\n\n   - The numerator, \\(x(x + 1)^2\\), is zero at \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = -1\\).\n   - The denominator, \\(x - 7\\), is zero at \\(x = 7\\).\n   - The whole expression is undefined at \\(x = 7\\).\n\n2. **Revisiting the Intervals:**\n\n   Now, I'll focus on the signs of \\(x\\) and \\(x - 7\\) directly, since \\((x + 1)^2\\) is always non-negative:\n\n   - **Interval \\( (-\\infty, 0) \\):** Here, \\(x < 0\\) makes \\(x\\) negative, and \\(x - 7\\) negative.\n     - \\(\\text{Sign of } \\frac{x}{x - 7} = \\frac{-}{-} = +\\). Not satisfactory for \\(\\leq 0\\).\n\n   - **Interval \\( (0, 7) \\):** Here, \\(x > 0\\) makes \\(x\\) positive, and \\(x - 7\\) negative.\n     - \\(\\text{Sign of } \\frac{x}{x - 7} = \\frac{+}{-} = -\\). This interval satisfies \\(\\leq 0\\).\n\n   - **Interval \\( (7, \\infty) \\):** Here, both \\(x > 0\\) and \\(x - 7 > 0\\).\n     - \\(\\text{Sign of } \\frac{x}{x - 7} = \\frac{+}{+} = +\\). Not satisfactory for \\(\\leq 0\\).\n\n3. **Boundary Considerations:**\n\n   - At \\(x = 0\\), \\(x(x + 1)^2 = 0\\), satisfying the inequality.\n   - At \\(x = -1\\), \\((x + 1)^2\\) is zero, thus the whole expression is zero, satisfying the inequality.\n   - At \\(x = 7\\), the expression is undefined.\n\n**Solution in Interval Notation:**\n\nUpon re-evaluation and considering the consistent non-negativity of \\((x + 1)^2\\), the solution is \\(x \\in \\{-1\\} \\cup [0, 7)\\).\n\nAh, there we go! This revised solution aligns with expectations and matches the corrected insights. Reflecting on this process, I see how important it is to consider each component's contribution to signs, especially when one part is always positive or zero.",
