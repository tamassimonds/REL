    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem of finding \\(\\cos 330^\\circ\\). I'll share my thought process as I go through it.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- When I see this, I immediately think about the unit circle. However, I\u2019m a bit rusty on which angle this exactly corresponds to. \n- My first instinct is to reduce the problem to something more familiar. \n- 330\u00b0 seems pretty close to a full circle (360\u00b0), so I\u2019m thinking there might be a way to relate it back to that somehow.\n\n**Step 1: Relate to Known Angles**\n- Let's start by visualizing what 330\u00b0 means on the unit circle.\n- 330\u00b0 is the same as \\(360^\\circ - 30^\\circ\\), which places it in the fourth quadrant.\n- That's interesting because I know sine and cosine values of 30\u00b0 pretty well. \n\n**Step 2: Understanding Quadrants**\n- In the fourth quadrant, cosine is positive and sine is negative.\n- This should help guide the calculations because I know that \\(\\cos 330^\\circ\\) should be positive.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Cosine Identity**\n- Now, let's use the identity: \\(\\cos(360^\\circ - \\theta) = \\cos \\theta\\).\n- Since \\(330^\\circ = 360^\\circ - 30^\\circ\\), we can use the identity with \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\).\n- So, \\(\\cos 330^\\circ = \\cos 30^\\circ\\).\n\n**Step 4: Calculating \\(\\cos 30^\\circ\\)**\n- Oh! I remember that \\(\\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n- This makes sense because the cosine of angles in the first quadrant remain positive.\n\n**Step 5: Verifying the Logic**\n- Double-check: Yes, since \\(\\cos 330^\\circ = \\cos(360^\\circ - 30^\\circ) = \\cos 30^\\circ\\) and \\(\\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), everything aligns.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n- This just clicked! Remembering that cosine is even and periodic at certain angles helps simplify a lot of these problems.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- It all checks out. The angle 330\u00b0 really is in the fourth quadrant, and cosine remains positive there.\n- Calculation double-checked with known angle values: \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) feels right based on memorized unit circle values.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- \\(\\cos 330^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\nThis problem reminded me of the significance of understanding how these trig identities and the unit circle work together. It's like revisiting a familiar place I haven't been to in a while!",

Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, so $\\cos 330^\\circ = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$."
