    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle factoring the polynomial \\(7x^3 - 21x^2 + 14x\\). \n\n**Step 1: Initial Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at the expression \\(7x^3 - 21x^2 + 14x\\), and my first thought is that it resembles other polynomial problems I've factored before. Typically, the first step in factoring is to look for the greatest common factor (GCF). Here, I notice all the coefficients (7, 21, 14) look like they might have something in common, and each term has a power of \\(x\\).\n\n**Step 2: Finding the GCF**\n\nLet's determine the GCF of the terms:\n- The coefficients 7, 21, and 14 share a common factor, which is 7.\n- The smallest power of \\(x\\) in each term is \\(x^1\\).\n\nPutting it together, the GCF of the entire expression is \\(7x\\).\n\n**Step 3: Factoring out the GCF**\n\nAlright, time to factor \\(7x\\) out of each term:\n- From \\(7x^3\\), factoring out \\(7x\\) leaves \\(x^2\\).\n- From \\(-21x^2\\), factoring out \\(7x\\) leaves \\(-3x\\).\n- From \\(14x\\), factoring out \\(7x\\) leaves \\(2\\).\n\nLet me write this down: \n\\[ \n7x^3 - 21x^2 + 14x = 7x(x^2 - 3x + 2) \n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Factoring the Quadratic**\n\nOkay, so now I've factored out the GCF, I'm left with a quadratic \\(x^2 - 3x + 2\\) inside the parentheses. Let's see if this quadratic can be factored further into two binomials. This usually involves finding two numbers that multiply to the constant term (+2) and add to the linear coefficient (-3).\n\nThinking about it:\n- Factors of 2 that add up to -3 are -1 and -2. \n\nNice, this works! Let\u2019s express the quadratic as a product of two binomials:\n\\[ \nx^2 - 3x + 2 = (x - 1)(x - 2) \n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Putting it all together**\n\nNow, incorporating this back into our expression gives:\n\\[ \n7x(x^2 - 3x + 2) = 7x(x - 1)(x - 2) \n\\]\n\n**Step 6: Double Checking**\n\nAlright, let me double-check the whole process to make sure the factorization is correct:\n- GCF: Checking again, \\(7x\\) is indeed common to all terms.\n- The factors \\((x - 1)\\) and \\((x - 2)\\) multiply correctly to give \\(x^2 - 3x + 2\\).\n\nI haven't missed any other factorization opportunities, so this should be correct. The complete factorization of the polynomial is:\n\\[ \n7x \\cdot (x - 1) \\cdot (x - 2) \n\\]\n\nEverything seems to check out. I've factored the expression correctly by first extracting the GCF and then factoring the resulting quadratic.",

  "ground_truth": "Both 7 and $x$ are factors of each term, so we can factor out $7x$: \\[7x^3 -21x^2 + 14x = (7x)\\cdot(x^2) - (7x)\\cdot (3x) + (7x)\\cdot 2 = 7x(x^2 - 3x + 2).\\]We can factor $x^2 - 3x + 2$ into $(x-1)(x-2)$, to get our answer of $\\boxed{7x(x-1)(x-2)}$."
