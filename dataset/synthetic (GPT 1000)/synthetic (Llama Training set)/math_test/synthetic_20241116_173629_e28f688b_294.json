    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. My goal is to find the sum of the digits of the integer \\(10^{51} - 9\\). This is a large number, so I need to strategize to simplify the process.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe number \\(10^{51}\\) is a 1 followed by 51 zeros. Thus, \\(10^{51} - 9\\) will be very close to this large number, but I need to see what it really looks like in standard form.\n\n**Initial thought:** \nThis seems like a straightforward subtraction problem at first glance, but given the massive size of \\(10^{51}\\), it's also about pattern recognition.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring the Structure of the Number\nI think I can visualize this number. To subtract 9 from \\(10^{51}\\) means borrowing across a long string of zeros. A similar, smaller-scale example is \\(10^4 - 9 = 9991\\). I suspect a pattern will emerge with all these 9s.\n\nLet's articulate what \\(10^{51} - 9\\) looks like:\n\n- \\(10^{51}\\) is \"1\" followed by 51 zeros.\n- Subtracting 9 means we borrow, turning all but the first digit of this giant number into 9s.\n\nSo, \\(10^{51} - 9\\) should look like:\n\\[ 999...9991 \\]\nwhere there are 50 nines following the initial digit before the last one flips to a 1.\n\n### Step 3: Writing the Number Explicitly\nThe number \\(10^{51} - 9\\) written out would be:\n\\[ 999\\ldots9991 \\]\nwith exactly 51 digits: 50 repeated 9s followed by a 1.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Sum of Digits\nNow, I need the sum of the digits of this number:\n\n- The sequence begins with fifty 9s and ends with one 1.\n- Sum of fifty 9s: \\(50 \\times 9 = 450\\)\n- Add the last digit (1): \\(450 + 1 = 451\\)\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Reflection\n**Quick mental check:** My logic seems consistent with smaller examples. Subtraction from a power of ten like this always yields repeated nines leading to the number of total digits minus the 1 present.\n\nDoes this solution make sense? Let's verify with the pattern:\n- My steps logically follow how borrowing operates in large numbers, and the mathematical manipulation aligns with arithmetic rules. I feel confident that the number of nines is correctly calculated.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter breaking down and figuring out the patterns and structure behind the number \\(10^{51} - 9\\), I've calculated the sum of its digits successfully. The answer is \\(\\boxed{451}\\).\n\nReflecting on the process, conceptualizing subtraction in terms of borrowing across zeroes (from powers of ten) was crucial for verifying this approach. The pattern of repeated 9s was the main realization that simplified this large arithmetic problem.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $10^{51}$ is the least integer with $52$ digits, $10^{51}-9$ has 51 digits.  The ones digit is 1 and all the other digits are 9.  The sum of the digits is $9\\cdot 50 + 1=\\boxed{451}$."
