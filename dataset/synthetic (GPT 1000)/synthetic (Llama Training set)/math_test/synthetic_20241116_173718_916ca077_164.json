    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and really think it through. We're given that a square has a perimeter of \\(28 \\text{ cm}\\) and we need to find its area, in \\(\\text{cm}^2\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Brainstorming\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I'm reminded of the basic properties of squares. A square has four equal sides, and the perimeter is the total length around it. I know that the perimeter \\(P\\) of a square can be calculated as \\(4 \\times \\text{side}\\).\n\n- **Perimeter of a square formula**: \\(P = 4s\\), where \\(s\\) is the side length.\n- Hmm, since we have the perimeter, we can potentially use that to find the side length.\n\nBut before jumping into calculations, let's gather all thoughts:\n\n- **Strategy 1**: Use the formula \\(P = 4s\\) to find the side. Once we have the side, use it to calculate the area \\(A = s^2\\).\n- What about other ways? Could it be approached differently? Since we're working with geometric properties, this seems direct and simplest. \n\n### Reflect and Choose a Strategy\n\nGiven the straightforward relationship between side lengths and perimeter in squares, I feel confident sticking with **Strategy 1**. Let's proceed with that.\n\n### Calculations and Solving\n\n1. **Using Perimeter to Find the Side Length:**\n\n   - We know \\(P = 4s = 28 \\text{ cm}\\).\n   - Solve for \\(s\\): \n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{28}{4} = 7 \\text{ cm}\n     \\]\n\n   Oh, that wasn\u2019t too bad. Let's ensure this makes sense. If \\(s\\) is \\(7 \\text{ cm}\\), then \\(4 \\times 7\\) gives back the perimeter of \\(28\\). Perfect, that\u2019s consistent.\n\n2. **Finding the Area:**\n\n   - Now, with \\(s = 7 \\text{ cm}\\), calculate the area:\n     \\[\n     A = s^2 = 7^2 = 49 \\text{ cm}^2\n     \\]\n\n   So, our calculation shows the area is \\(49 \\text{ cm}^2\\). Does that sound right? \n\n### Double-Check and Reflections\n\n- Quick Check: We started with a perimeter of \\(28 \\text{ cm}\\), got a side length of \\(7 \\text{ cm}\\) (which fits the perimeter formula), and calculated the area as \\(49 \\text{ cm}^2\\). All steps tie together logically.\n- Consider alternative checks like redoing the perimeter calculation with the side length, but we've affirmed \\(P = 28 \\text{ cm}\\) matches the side length and calculation of area.\n\nEverything seems coherent. If anything felt off, I'd loop back through calculations or redefine the approach. Fortunately, the problem follows straightforward mathematics.\n\nThe final answer is the area of the square is \\(49 \\text{ cm}^2\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since the four sides of a square are equal in length and the perimeter is $28,$ then each side has length $\\frac{28}{4}=7.$  The area of the square is the product of the length and width, which are each equal to $7.$ Therefore, the area of the square in $\\mbox{cm}^2$ is $7\\times7=\\boxed{49}.$"
