    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem by breaking it down step-by-step. The problem involves a circular sheet of paper being cut into sectors and each sector being shaped into a cone. Our goal is to determine the height of one such cone.\n\n**First Thoughts**\n\n- This reminds me of problems involving transformations of two-dimensional shapes into three-dimensional objects. When a circle is divided into sectors and each sector is formed into a cone, it feels similar to those times I've dealt with net shapes in geometry.\n- I have a vague recollection that the radius of the original circle of the paper is relevant to the slant height of the cone. \n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Circle and Sectors**\n\nThe circle has a radius of 6 inches. When it's cut into 3 equal sectors, each sector has a central angle of \\(360^\\circ / 3 = 120^\\circ\\).\n\n- So, each sector is a portion of the entire circle. This might mean that if the circle was unwrapped into a full circle (360 degrees), each sector represents one-third of that circle.\n\n**Step 2: Sector as a Cone**\n\nEach sector turns into a cone. Here's what I'm thinking:\n- The arc length of each sector becomes the circumference of the cone's base.\n- The radius of the circle (6 inches) becomes the slant height of each cone.\n\n**Calculate Arc Length**\n\nArc length of a sector = \\((\\theta / 360)\\) x \\(2\\pi \\times \\text{radius}\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the central angle.\n\nFor one sector, this is: \n\\[ \\text{Arc length} = (120/360) \\times 2\\pi \\times 6 = (1/3) \\times 12\\pi = 4\\pi \\text{ inches} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Formulating the Cone**\n\n- The arc length of the sector, 4\u03c0 inches, is the base's circumference of the cone.\n- If I remember correctly, when I previously handled cones,  the circumference \\(C\\) related to the radius \\(r\\) of the base of a cone as: \\(C = 2\\pi r\\).\n  \nSo, setting \\(4\\pi = 2\\pi r\\), we get:\n\\[ 2\\pi r = 4\\pi \\]\n\\[ r = 2\\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Height of the Cone**\n\nI have the base radius \\(r\\) of 2 inches and the slant height \\(l\\) of the cone, which is the original radius of the circle, 6 inches.\n\n- Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius, height, and slant height of the cone:\n  \n  \\[ l^2 = r^2 + h^2 \\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[ 6^2 = 2^2 + h^2 \\]\n\n\\[ 36 = 4 + h^2 \\]\n\n\\[ h^2 = 32 \\]\n\n\\[ h = \\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\n**Check the Work**\n\n- Each step seems consistent with the geometric principles of circle sectors becoming cones.\n- Quick sanity check: The numbers and formula logic are aligned with geometric transformations.\n- Reflection: It looks like I've used the right principles to calculate radius and height.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe height of each cone formed from the paper sectors is \\(4\\sqrt{2}\\) inches. That's a solid path from circle through transformations to cone dimensions.",

  "ground_truth": "A circular sheet of paper with radius 6 inches has a circumference of $2\\pi r = 2 \\pi (6) = 12\\pi$ inches. Since this sheet of paper is cut into 3 equal sectors, each sector must have an arc length of $1/3$ that of the original circle, so each sector has an arc length of $4\\pi$ inches. Because of the way that a cone is formed, the original radius of the circle now becomes the slant height of the cone and the arc length becomes the perimeter of the cone's base. If we let the radius of the cone base be $R$, then we know that the circumference $4\\pi$ must equal $2\\pi R$, so $2 \\pi R = 4 \\pi$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2\\pi$, we get that the radius of the cone base is $2$ inches.\n\nWe then notice that the radius of the base, the altitude of the cone, and the slant height of the cone form a right triangle where the slant height is the hypotenuse. Since we know both the radius and the slant height, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height $h$ of the cone. We have that $2^2 + h^2 = 6^2$, so $h^2=32$. Taking the square root of both sides, we have that $h=\\sqrt{32}=\\boxed{4\\sqrt{2}}$ inches."
