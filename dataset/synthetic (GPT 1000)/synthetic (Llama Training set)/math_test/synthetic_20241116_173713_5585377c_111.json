    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step and allow the thought process to unfold naturally.\n\n**First Impressions:**\n\n- At first glance, we need to solve the inequality \\(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\). Immediately, this reminds me of dealing with polynomials and perhaps trying to factor or complete the square could be helpful. I need to find where this expression sits between \\(-4\\) and \\(21\\).\n\n**Simplifying Our Task:**\n\n1. Begin by breaking it into two separate inequalities:\n\n   \\(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\\) and \\(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\).\n\n2. Let's start with \\(x^4 + 4x^2\\). It looks like a polynomial in \\(x^2\\).\n\n3. Notice that if we let \\(y = x^2\\), then the inequality becomes:\n   - \\(-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21\\).\n\n**Approach for \\(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\\):**\n\n4. Consider the inequality \\(y^2 + 4y > -4\\):\n   - Rearrange to get \\(y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0\\).\n   - Factor it: \\((y + 2)^2 > 0\\).\n\n5. The expression \\((y + 2)^2\\) is always non-negative and is zero when \\(y = -2\\).\n   - But since \\(y = x^2\\) and \\(x^2\\) is always non-negative, \\(y\\) cannot equal \\(-2\\).\n\n6. Concluding that \\((y + 2)^2 > 0\\) is always satisfied for all \\(x\\).\n\n**Approach for \\(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\\):**\n\n7. Now tackle the inequality \\(y^2 + 4y < 21\\).\n   - Rearrange: \\(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\\).\n   - Think about factoring it: Check if it can be factored easily... After some trial, say:\n     \\( (y + 7)(y - 3) < 0 \\).\n\n8. The critical points of the quadratic are \\(y = -7\\) and \\(y = 3\\). \n\n9. Since \\(y = x^2\\), this implies \\(0 \\leq y = x^2 < 3\\).\n   - Therefore \\(-\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n**Combining Results:**\n\n10. The relevant range where both parts of the inequality are satisfied is \\(-\\sqrt{3} < x < \\sqrt{3}\\). I believe this is the appropriate conclusion for the strict bounds of \\(x\\).\n\n**Verification and Reflection:**\n\n11. After solving, reflect and verify by considering:\n   - Plugging in edge values such as \\(x = \\sqrt{2}\\), \\(x = 0\\).\n   - Check the polynomial values at these points ensure they indeed fit within the desired range of the inequality.\n   - This approach confirms the bounds.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe solution in interval notation is \\((- \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})\\).\n\nThis exploration was an opportunity to engage with polynomial inequalities, substitutions, and critical thinking about ranges, ensuring alignment with all constraints provided by the inequalities.",

  "ground_truth": "Let us first define $y=x^{2}$. We can then plug this value into the inequality and add 4 to $-4$, $x^4+4x^2$, and 21, yielding $$0<y^{2}+4y+4<25.$$We can factor $y^2+4y+4$ to obtain $$0<(y+2)^{2}<25.$$Taking the square root gives us $0<|y+2|<5$, which in turn gives us two intervals for solutions of $y$: $-2<y<3$, or $-7<y<-2$.\n\nHowever, $y$ must be non-negative since $y=x^{2}$, so we have $0\\leq y<3$. This means that $-\\sqrt{3}< x<\\sqrt{3}$ satisfies the original inequality. In interval notation, this is $\\boxed{(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})}$."
