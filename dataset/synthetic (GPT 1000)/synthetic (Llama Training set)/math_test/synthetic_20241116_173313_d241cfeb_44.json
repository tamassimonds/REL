    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with an open mind and start breaking it down:\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n1. The problem is asking for the remainder of the expression \\((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\\) when divided by 7, with the condition that \\(n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}\\). Hmm, this reminds me of similar problems involving modular arithmetic, where simplifying expressions under modulo can make things clearer.\n\n2. I remember that when dealing with modular arithmetic, it often helps to simplify any expressions as much as possible modulo the given divisor, here it's 7.\n\n**Brainstorming and Exploring Strategies:**\n\n- **Strategy 1: Substitution and Simplification:**\n\n    Since \\(n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}\\), it means \\(n = 7k + 2\\) for some integer \\(k\\). Let\u2019s substitute \\(n = 2\\) directly into the expression \\((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\\) because we are concerned with its equivalence modulo 7, not with the specific values themselves.\n\n    If \\(n = 2\\), then:\n    \\[\n    (n + 2) = (2 + 2) = 4, \\quad (n + 4) = (2 + 4) = 6, \\quad (n + 6) = (2 + 6) = 8\n    \\]\n\n    Now, substitute these into the given expression:\n    \\[\n    (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8\n    \\]\n    \n    Before calculating the product outright, let's reduce each component modulo 7:\n    \\[\n    4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}, \\quad 6 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}, \\quad 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\, (\\text{since } 8 = 7 + 1)\n    \\]\n\n    Now multiply these reduced values:\n    \\[\n    4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 1 = 24 \n    \\]\n\n    Finally, find 24 modulo 7:\n    \\[\n    24 \\div 7 = 3 \\quad \\text{remainder } 3\n    \\]\n\n    So, \\((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}\\).\n\n**Reflections and Checks:**\n\n- This approach used direct substitution and checked at each step, simplifying with respect to modulo 7. It feels clean because it used the properties of congruences directly.\n\n- Let me quickly check if there's a conceivable miscalculation: Substitutive simplification is straightforward here, with each step verified by minor arithmetic modulo operations, so no apparent mistakes jump out.\n\n- I can trust this process because modular arithmetic is consistent\u2014if \\(n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}\\), then any operation on \\(n\\) will conform to the same congruence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe remainder when \\((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\\) is divided by 7, given \\(n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}\\), is 3.",
