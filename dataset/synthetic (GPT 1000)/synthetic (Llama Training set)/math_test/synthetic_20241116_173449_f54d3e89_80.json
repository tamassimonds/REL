    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to figure out how many hours 36 bales of hay will last for 12 horses, given that six horses consume 12 bales in 12 hours.\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- Initially, this looks like a proportional or ratio problem.\n- The phrasing suggests figuring out the rate at which horses consume hay and extending it to another situation.\n\nBrainstorming:\n- We have a situation with 6 horses consuming a certain amount of hay in a set number of hours, and now we need to understand how time and quantity changes affect consumption.\n- One way is to find the rate of consumption first. It sounds like a unit-rate problem.\n- Another way could be setting up a proportion based on the two different scenarios (one with 6 horses and the other with 12 horses).\n\nStep-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Determine the rate of consumption for one horse**:\n   - Given: 6 horses eat 12 bales in 12 hours.\n   - To find out how much one horse eats, consider 6 horses consuming 12 bales: the total consumption per horse would be \\(12 \\text{ bales} / 6 \\text{ horses} = 2 \\text{ bales per horse}\\).\n   - This consumption occurs over 12 hours, so \\(2 \\text{ bales in 12 hours}\\) per horse.\n\n2. **Rate of consumption per horse per hour**:\n   - \\(2 \\text{ bales} / 12 \\text{ hours} = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ bales per hour per horse}\\).\n   - This is the rate at which one horse consumes hay.\n\n3. **Determine the consumption for 12 horses**:\n   - If one horse uses \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) bale per hour, then 12 horses will use:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 2 \\text{ bales per hour}\n   \\]\n   - Here, twice the number of horses means double the consumption per hour compared to 6 horses.\n\n4. **Calculate how long 36 bales will last 12 horses**:\n   - With 12 horses eating at a rate of 2 bales per hour:\n   \\[\n   36 \\text{ bales} / 2 \\text{ bales per hour} = 18 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nReflecting on the Calculation:\n- The logical steps seem correct as the calculation checks out. We started with a known rate and scaled it according to the change in the number of horses.\n- Quick check: 6 horses eat 12 bales in 12 hours, so scaling things proportionately, doubling the horses doubles the rate of consumption. Everything aligns nicely.\n\nFinal Answer:\n- At the rate given, 36 bales of hay will last 12 horses for 18 hours.",

  "ground_truth": "From the original rate, we note that 12 horses will eat 12 bales of hay in 6 hours. (Double the number of horses, half the time)  Therefore, 12 horses will eat 36 bales of hay in $\\boxed{18\\text{ hours}}$. (Triple the amount of hay, triple the time)"
