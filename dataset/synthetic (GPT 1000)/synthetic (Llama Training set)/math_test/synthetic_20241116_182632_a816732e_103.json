    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. It's about finding out the minimum height of a cylindrical container required to hold all the milk from a hemispherical cup. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to clearly understand the geometry involved. We have two shapes:\n\n1. **Hemispherical Cup:** It's half of a sphere, and its radius is 3 inches.\n2. **Cylindrical Container:** It has a radius of 2 inches, and I need to find its height.\n\nThe task is essentially to equate the volume of the hemisphere (which was full of milk) to the volume of the cylinder (which we'll fill with this milk) and solve for the height of the cylinder.\n\n### Step 2: Volume Calculations\n\n**Volume of a Hemisphere:**\n\nOh, I remember that the volume of a full sphere is \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\). Since we're dealing with a hemisphere (half of a sphere), the volume will be half of that:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{hemisphere}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3\n\\]\n\nLet's plug in the radius, \\( r = 3 \\) inches:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{hemisphere}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi \\times 27 = 18\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\nAlright, that seems reasonable. Always good to double-check, but \\(18\\pi\\) sounds right.\n\n**Volume of a Cylinder:**\n\nThe general formula for the volume of a cylinder is \\(\\pi r^2 h\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius and \\(h\\) is the height. Here, \\( r = 2 \\) inches, and I need to find \\( h \\).\n\nThe volume of milk (from the hemisphere) should equal the volume of the cylinder:\n\n\\[\n\\pi (2)^2 h = 18\\pi\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n4\\pi h = 18\\pi\n\\]\n\nI can cancel \\(\\pi\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n4h = 18\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 4 gives:\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{18}{4} = 4.5\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Verification and Reflection\n\nOkay, that was a bit too straightforward. I should pause and double-check to ensure I haven't made a mistake. \n\n- Double-checking the math: \\(4h = 18\\), so \\(h = 4.5\\) definitely holds.\n- Revisiting the given dimensions: A hemisphere with a radius of 3 inches converts into a cylindrical shape with a radius of 2 inches and height 4.5 inches. Seems consistent since the milk's volume remains unchanged.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nSince all steps led us consistent results, I'm confident the minimum height of the cylindrical container is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4.5}\n\\]\n\nThis makes logical sense given the volumes were handled correctly, and it's always good to reflect and verify at each step as done. Feels satisfying to reach this answer methodically!",

  "ground_truth": "The hemisphere-shaped milk cup has volume \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3^3) = 2\\cdot 3^2\\pi = 18\\pi\\] cubic inches.  A cylindrical container with height $h$ has volume \\[\\pi(2^2)(h)=4\\pi h\\] cubic inches.  The milk will fit if \\[4\\pi h \\ge 18\\pi.\\]   Dividing both sides of the inequality by $4\\pi$ gives \\[h\\ge 4.5,\\]  so the minimum height is $\\boxed{4.5}$ inches."
