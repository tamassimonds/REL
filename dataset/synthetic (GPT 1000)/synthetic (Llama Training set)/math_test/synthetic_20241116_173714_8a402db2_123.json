    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\nThis problem involves comparing the rates at which water flows into and drains from a birdbath. The key idea here is the difference between these rates, which will affect how the water volume changes over time. The goal is to identify a graph that accurately represents this change in volume, taking into account the constant flow in and the operational drainage.\n\nBrainstorming:\n1. The water flows in at 20 milliliters per minute, but drains at 18 milliliters per minute. Initially, this sounds like a classic problem of net flow. The net flow rate is what will cause the change in volume of the birdbath.\n2. The net inflow rate is \\(20 - 18 = 2\\) milliliters per minute. This means that for each minute, the volume of water in the birdbath increases by 2 milliliters until it overflows.\n3. Once the birdbath fills up and reaches its capacity, any additional water will overflow but the volume should stay constant because the inflow equals outflow during overflow.\n\nChecking Understanding:\nSo initially, the graph of the volume should show an increase, and once it reaches capacity, it should level off (stay constant). I\u2019m looking for a graph which first increases and then becomes flat after the overflowing starts.\n\nApproach:\nLet's look at each graph to see which one fits this behavior pattern.\n\nGraph Analysis:\n- Graph A: Shows an initial increase but becomes flat or constant, which seems promising. \n- Graph B: Starts at a higher point and decreases, which doesn't match the problem since there should be a net increase first.\n- Graph C: Shows a steady, linear increase without leveling off. There's no constant region, so it's unlikely.\n- Graph D: Begins slightly above zero and stays constant, which doesn't fit because it never increases.\n- Graph E: Shows a rise and then a fall which is not expected since overflow should not decrease volume.\n\nVerification:\nBased on understanding and analysis, the correct graph should show an increase followed by a horizontal line indicating constant overflow and a balance in inflow and outflow. The behavior described seems to best match Graph A, which initially rises and then levels off.\n\nConclusion:\nGraph A correctly represents the volume filling up due to the net flow rate of 2 milliliters per minute, then hitting an overflow and staying constant when inflow equals outflow.\n\nAnswer: A",
