    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem! The task is to find the value of \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^3\\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:** \nAt first glance, this reminds me of manipulating fractions and exponents. The expression involves taking powers of fractions and then multiplying them. My first instinct is to look for a way to simplify the process by factoring or combining terms if possible. I suspect there might be a property that can simplify this problem. \n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n1. **Use of Exponent Rules:** One rule of exponents that stands out is \\((a^m)(b^m) = (ab)^m\\). This could simplify our multiplication since both terms are raised to the power of 3.\n\n   Applying this rule:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^3 = \\left(\\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{4}{5}\\right)^3\n   \\]\n\n   Let's simplify inside the parentheses now:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{7 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{20}{35}\n   \\]\n\n   **Aha!** Here, the 5s cancel each other out:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{35} = \\frac{4}{7}\n   \\]\n\n   So, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\right)^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the Power:** Now I need to calculate \\(\\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\right)^3\\). I'll use the formula for powers of fractions:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^m = \\frac{a^m}{b^m}\n   \\]\n\n   Applying this gives:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{4^3}{7^3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Each Power:** \n   \\[\n   4^3 = 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\times 4 = 64\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   7^3 = 7 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\times 7 = 343\n   \\]\n\n   Now, substitute these back into the fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\right)^3 = \\frac{64}{343}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Check:**\nLet me reflect on this. Each step seems logical, and I've used exponent rules correctly. When I further break it down, \\(\\frac{5}{7} \\times \\frac{4}{5}\\) simplifies neatly, which reinforces that the core multiplication and cancellation were correctly performed. Computing the powers is straightforward as these are small numbers.\n\nHence, the final answer is \\(\\frac{64}{343}\\).\n\nThis feels solid. I don't see any glaring mistakes or better approaches right now, so I'll conclude here.",

  "ground_truth": "Recall that if $b$ is nonzero and $n$ is a positive integer, then $$\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^{n}=\\frac{a^n}{b^n}.$$For this problem we have $$\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^{3}\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{3}=\\frac{5^3}{7^3}\\cdot \\frac{4^3}{5^3}=\\frac{5^3\\cdot 4^3}{7^3\\cdot 5^3}.$$We can simplify because there is a factor of $5^3$ in the numerator and the denominator.  To do this we use the commutative property of multiplication and use the multiplication rule in reverse as follows $$\\frac{5^3\\cdot 4^3}{7^3\\cdot 5^3}=\\frac{4^3\\cdot 5^3}{7^3\\cdot 5^3}=\\frac{4^3}{7^3}\\cdot \\frac{5^3}{5^3}=\\frac{4^3}{7^3}\\cdot 1=\\frac{4^3}{7^3}=\\boxed{\\frac{64}{343}}.$$We also might have noted that \\[\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^{3}\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^{3}=\\left(\\frac57\\cdot \\frac45\\right)^3 = \\left(\\frac47\\right)^3 = \\frac{4^3}{7^3} = \\boxed{\\frac{64}{343}}.\\]"
