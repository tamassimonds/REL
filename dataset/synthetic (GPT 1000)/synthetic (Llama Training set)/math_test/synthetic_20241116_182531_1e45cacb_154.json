    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step, exploring different strategies and really thinking out loud as we tackle it.\n\n### Understanding the Question\n\nFirst thoughts: We know that we're dealing with a three-digit integer \\( N \\) that ends in 0. This means \\( N \\) is a multiple of 10. We're trying to determine the probability that such an \\( N \\) is also divisible by 4. I remember something about divisibility rules, maybe that's where I should start...\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n1. **Considering Divisibility Rules:**\n   - Since \\( N \\) ends in a 0, it's obvious \\( N = 10m \\) for some integer \\( m \\). \n   - For divisibility by 4: A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\n   - Given that \\( N \\%'s\\) ones digit is 0, the tens digit is the key here. If I think about \\( N = 100a + 10b + 0 \\) (since it ends in 0), then the last two digits are \\( 10b \\).\n\n2. **Checking Divisibility of \\( 10b \\) by 4:**\n   - The number \\( 10b \\) must be divisible by 4. Let's see, \\( 10b \\div 4 = \\frac{10}{4}b = 2.5b \\) doesn't work neatly, unless... Wait, I can't divide 10 by 4 directly.\n\n3. **Re-think:**\n   - Oh! I see, for \\( 10b \\) to be divisible by 4, \\( b \\) must be such that \\( 10 \\times b \\) is cleanly divisible by 4.\n   - If \\( b \\) is even, then \\( 10b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}\\) works. Here's why: \\( 10b = 8b + 2b \\). For simplicity, if \\( b = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 \\) works because \\( 8b \\) is already a multiple of 4 and \\( 2b \\) must also be.\n\n4. **Checking Outcomes:**\n   - Consider cases that make \\( b \\) work: when \\( b = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 \\). \n   - ## Reflection: Do all even \\( b \\) work?\n   - \\( b = 2 \\rightarrow 20 \\div 4 = 5 \\), \\( b = 4 \\rightarrow 40 \\div 4 = 10 \\) etc. Yep, makes sense.\n\n5. **Counting and Probability:**\n   - For three-digit \\( N \\), \\( N \\) ranges from 100 to 999. But actually, endpoints are more: \\( 100 \\rightarrow 990 \\) since they need 0, so 900 numbers.\n   - Focus on \\( b \\) choices: 0, 1, ..., 9 (10 in total).\n\n### Final Step: Probability Calculation\n\nDivisible by 4? Even \\( b \\): five options (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).\n\nProbability that \\( N \\) is divisible by 4:  \n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}. \\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nThis approach seems right: Each digit \\( b \\) from 0-9 contributes equally to total combinations (interchange_number), simple tally of even to total gives half the cases. If one missed counting ways or misspelled \\( m \\) v. \\( b \\), you'd drop a skill to fix it later.\n\nAlright, feels like I've leaped through okay. My journey through thought process tells this solution checks out correctly.",

  "ground_truth": "An integer is divisible by 4 if and only if a number formed from the last two digits is divisible by 4. If the units digit is 0, all the numbers with even tens digits are divisible by 4 (00, 20, 40, 60, 80), and all the numbers with odd tens digits are not (10, 30, 50, 70, 90). Since there are the same number of even digits as odd digits, there is a $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ probability that $N$ is divisible by 4."
