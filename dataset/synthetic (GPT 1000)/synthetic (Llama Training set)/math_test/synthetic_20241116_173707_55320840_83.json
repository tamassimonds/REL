    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step and really break down the thinking process involved. We need to find the domain of the function \\(q(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Initially, I recognize that the function involves square roots and a fraction. This immediately alerts me to possible domain restrictions since square roots require non-negative arguments and divisions require non-zero denominators.\n- There are potentially two main concerns here: ensuring the expression under the square root is non-negative, and making sure the denominator isn't zero.\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Square Root of x:**\n   - For the numerator \\(\\sqrt{x}\\), \\(x\\) must be non-negative because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real number system. So, we need \\(x \\geq 0\\).\n\n2. **Square Root in the Denominator:**\n   - For the denominator \\(\\sqrt{1-x^2}\\) to fully determine the second part of the domain, \\(1-x^2\\) must be positive because we cannot divide by zero.\n   - Moreover, under the square root, the expression \\(1-x^2\\) must be non-negative, which requires \\(1-x^2 > 0\\).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Inequalities:**\n   - The inequality \\(1-x^2 > 0\\) simplifies to:\n     - \\(1 > x^2\\)\n     - This implies \\(-1 < x < 1\\). \n\n4. **Combining Conditions:**\n   - From \\(\\sqrt{x}\\), we have \\(x \\geq 0\\).\n   - From \\(\\sqrt{1-x^2}\\) not being zero or negative, we have \\(-1 < x < 1\\).\n   - Combining these: \\(0 \\leq x < 1\\).\n\n**Check for Logical Consistency:**\n\n- Let\u2019s reiterate: The domain constraints for both parts intersect at \\(0 \\leq x < 1\\). \n- This means that the function is defined when \\(x\\) is any real number in the interval \\([0, 1)\\).\n\n**Reflect on Problem Solving Process:**\n\n- The process involved examining each component of the function separately and then combining the valid intervals. \n- Given that both \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) and the inverse \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\) have constraints, identifying where both constraints hold was key.\n\n**Final Thoughts and Answer:**\n\n- The domain of \\(q(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}\\) can be expressed as \\( [0, 1) \\). \n- The approach worked well, but it's always good to consider potential edge cases or recheck by substituting the endpoints to ensure the logic holds.\n\nAnd that wraps up our step-by-step exploration of finding the domain of the given function, with plenty of room for checking our thought processes along the way.",

  "ground_truth": "For $q(x)$ to be defined, the quantities under both radicals must be nonnegative, and the denominator must be nonzero. Thus we must have $x\\ge 0$ and $1-x^2>0$. The solution to the second inequality is $|x|<1$, so both inequalities are satisfied precisely when $x$ is in the interval $\\boxed{[0,1)}$."
