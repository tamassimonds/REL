    "working_out": "Alright, let's break this down step by step, approaching it like I would if I were solving it naturally and talking through my thought process.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem statements.**\n\nOkay, so I've got these two conditions:\n\n\\[\n\\cos x + \\cos y + \\cos z = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin x + \\sin y + \\sin z = 0\n\\]\n\nAnd I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\(\\cos(2x - y - z)\\).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze what these conditions mean geometrically.**\n\nThe sum of the cosines being zero could suggest some symmetrical or vector-related condition. Similarly, the sine conditions also suggest symmetry. Hmm, this reminds me of vectors or points in the plane where their sum might result in the origin. Could \\(x, y, z\\) be angles that describe positions on a unit circle?\n\n**Step 3: Explore a few strategies.**\n\n- **Vector Representation:** If I think of \\((\\cos x, \\sin x)\\) as a vector and similarly for the others, it seems like we are summing these vectors to get zero. That's an interesting insight because these vectors' head-to-tail sum being zero means they likely form a triangle or are directed symmetrically around the origin.\n\n- **Trigonometrical Identities:** I might also use some trigonometric identities to express one angle's sine or cosine in terms of the others. \n\n- **Symmetry and Equal Angles:** Another idea is that if these conditions hold, the angles might be symmetrically distributed. Could \\(x, y, z\\) be angles in an equilateral triangle scenario? If they divide the circle equally, then I might have a neat solution with known angles.\n\n**Step 4: Vector Approach Considerations**\n\nThinking in terms of vectors:\n\n\\[\n\\cos x + \\cos y + \\cos z = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sin x + \\sin y + \\sin z = 0\n\\]\n\nGeometrically, this implies that the vector sum of \\((\\cos x, \\sin x), (\\cos y, \\sin y), (\\cos z, \\sin z)\\) is zero. These vectors might form the sides of an equilateral triangle centered at the origin. This would make sense if \\(x, y, z\\) are angles of direction for vectors equidistant in their angle differences, i.e., spaced out by \\(120^\\circ\\).\n\n**Step 5: Test if symmetry works.**\n\nSet \\(x = 0\\), \\(y = 120^\\circ\\), and \\(z = 240^\\circ\\) (or suitable multiples/rotations of \\(120^\\circ\\) leading to similar conditions). This satisfies the sum conditions:\n\n1. \\( \\cos 0 + \\cos 120^\\circ + \\cos 240^\\circ = 1 - 0.5 - 0.5 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( \\sin 0 + \\sin 120^\\circ + \\sin 240^\\circ = 0 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0 \\)\n\nThis confirms the vectors evenly spaced out.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate \\(\\cos(2x - y - z)\\).**\n\nUsing the assumption \\(x = 0\\), \\(y = 120^\\circ\\), \\(z = 240^\\circ\\):\n\n\\[ \n2x - y - z = 0^\\circ - 120^\\circ - 240^\\circ = -360^\\circ \n\\]\n\nSince cosine has a period of \\(360^\\circ\\), \\(\\cos(-360^\\circ) = \\cos 0 = 1\\).\n\n**Step 7: Check if there could be other solutions or combinations.**\n\nConsidering other rotations like \\(120^\\circ, 240^\\circ, 360^\\circ\\) in place of zero, each of them could also produce either \\(\\cos(0)\\), \\(\\cos(360^\\circ)\\), etc., leading to a cosine value of 1. Essentially all valid rotation scenarios give the same result due to periodicity and symmetry.\n\n**Step 8: Conclusion.**\n\nAfter considering the possibilities with these symmetrically spaced angles, it consistently yields \\(\\cos(2x - y - z) = 1\\). Thus, the sum of all possible values is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",
