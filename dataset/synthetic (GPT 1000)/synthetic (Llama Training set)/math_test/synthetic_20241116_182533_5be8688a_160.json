    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. \n\n### First Thoughts:\nWhen I first look at this expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 - \\tan^2 x} + \\frac{1}{1 - \\cot^2 x}\\), it reminds me of some trigonometric identities, particularly those involving \\(\\tan x\\) and \\(\\cot x\\). The form \\(1 - \\tan^2 x\\) has some resemblance to the Pythagorean identity, so I think this problem might simplify with the use of identities.\n\n### Exploring Strategies:\n1. **Pythagorean Identities**: \n   We know that \\(\\tan^2 x + 1 = \\sec^2 x\\) and \\(\\cot^2 x + 1 = \\csc^2 x\\). But how do these relate directly?\n   \n2. **Rewriting Terms**: \n   Sometimes breaking down expressions into sine and cosine helps. Expressing \\(\\tan x\\) and \\(\\cot x\\) in terms of \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) might reveal something useful.\n\n3. **Common Denominator**: \n   Another approach would be combining the two fractions into one by finding a common denominator. Let's see, that would be \\((1 - \\tan^2 x)(1 - \\cot^2 x)\\). But, hmm, before I pursue this, it's getting complicated. I should maybe re-evaluate this.\n\n4. **Difference of Squares**:\n   The form \\(1 - \\tan^2 x\\) and \\(1 - \\cot^2 x\\) looks similar to a difference of squares. I know \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)\\). How might this apply here?\n\n### Attempting Solutions:\nLet's start with rewriting \\(\\tan x\\) and \\(\\cot x\\) in terms of \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\):\n\n- \\(\\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\)\n- \\(\\cot x = \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\)\n\nThis means:\n\\[ 1 - \\tan^2 x = 1 - \\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x}{\\cos^2 x}. \\]\n\nAnd:\n\\[ 1 - \\cot^2 x = 1 - \\left(\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\sin^2 x - \\cos^2 x}{\\sin^2 x}. \\]\n\nOh! This reminds me of the identities \\( \\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x = \\cos 2x \\) and \\(\\sin^2 x - \\cos^2 x = -\\cos 2x\\). This could clarify things.\n\nLet's continue:\n\n### Simplifying the Original Expression:\nSubstituting the above in the original expression:\n\n1. \\[ \\frac{1}{1 - \\tan^2 x} = \\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x} = \\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\cos 2x}. \\]\n\n2. \\[ \\frac{1}{1 - \\cot^2 x} = \\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\sin^2 x - \\cos^2 x} = \\frac{\\sin^2 x}{-\\cos 2x} = -\\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\cos 2x}. \\]\n\nNow combining them:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\cos^2 x}{\\cos 2x} - \\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\cos 2x} = \\frac{\\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x}{\\cos 2x}. \\]\n\nAnd we know from trigonometric identities:\n\n\\[ \\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x = \\cos 2x. \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x}{\\cos 2x} = \\frac{\\cos 2x}{\\cos 2x} = 1. \\]\n\n### Final Reflection:\nThe expression simplifies beautifully to 1. This fits well with our trigonometric identities. I should double-check, does this seem too straightforward? Every step seems solid with the identities used correctly.\n\nThis process was nice; trying different approaches led me back to identities which cleaned everything up. It was kind of messy initially, but looking at the familiar trigonometric shapes and identities found in every basic trig textbook really made it come together.\n\n### Answer:\nThe simplified form of the given expression is \\(1\\).",
