    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together. \n\n### Initial Thoughts:\nWhen I see \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x+2} \\), it reminds me of nested functions or a composite function problem. We're asked to find \\( f(f(1)) \\). My initial thought is that we need to calculate \\( f(1) \\) first and then substitute that result back into the function \\( f(x) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\( f(1) \\)\nFirst, let's substitute \\( x = 1 \\) into the function \\( f(x) \\):\n\\[ f(1) = \\frac{1}{1 + 2} = \\frac{1}{3}. \\]\n\n### Reflection:\nOkay, so \\( f(1) = \\frac{1}{3} \\). This result seems straightforward. Now, moving on to the next step with this value.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate \\( f(f(1)) \\)\nNow that we have \\( f(1) = \\frac{1}{3} \\), we need to find \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\). Let's substitute again:\n\\[ f\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{3} + 2}. \\]\n\n### Converting Mixed Fractions:\nOkay, I realize I have a mixed fraction situation. Recall that adding fractions involves finding a common denominator or converting them. This looks a bit messy. Let\u2019s work it out:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} + 2 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{6}{3} = \\frac{1 + 6}{3} = \\frac{7}{3}. \\]\n\n### Substitute and Simplify:\nNow substitute back into \\( f(x) \\):\n\\[ f\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{3}}.\\]\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{3}}\\), you multiply by the reciprocal:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{3}} = \\frac{3}{7}. \\]\n\n### Deep Reflection:\nAlright, let\u2019s think about this. The process feels correct: got \\( f(1) = \\frac{1}{3} \\) and then computed \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{3}{7} \\). Both calculations line up, and nothing feels off about the operations.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, \\( f(f(1)) = \\frac{3}{7} \\).\n\nThroughout the process, I expressed my thoughts and reflections to ensure accuracy and truthfulness at every step. I didn't find any dead ends, so I think my approach is sound. I feel good about this solution!",
