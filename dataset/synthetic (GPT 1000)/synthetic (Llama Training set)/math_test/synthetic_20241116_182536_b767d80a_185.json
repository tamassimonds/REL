    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem by taking it one step at a time and really getting into the nitty-gritty of the thought process. \n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe need to find the product \\( xy \\) given two equations:\n\n1. \\( 2x - 9y = 14 \\)\n2. \\( 6x = 42 + y \\)\n\nInitially, I notice these are two linear equations. This suggests that solving them simultaneously will give me the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Once I have those, calculating \\( xy \\) will be straightforward. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWhen looking at simultaneous equations like these, substitution and elimination are common methods. I feel like substitution might work well here, especially since the second equation is almost in a format that easily allows substitution.\n\n**Let's Try Substitution:**\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n\\[ 6x = 42 + y \\]\n\nI can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ y = 6x - 42 \\]\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. Now, I can substitute this for \\( y \\) in the first equation:\n\n\\[ 2x - 9(6x - 42) = 14 \\]\n\n**Simplifying the Substituted Equation:**\n\nThis looks a bit messy, but let's simplify it step-by-step:\n\n1. Distribute the \\( -9 \\):\n\n   \\[ = 2x - 54x + 378 \\]\n   \n2. Combine like terms:\n\n   \\[ = -52x + 378 = 14 \\]\n\n3. Isolate \\( x \\):\n\n   \\[ -52x = 14 - 378 \\]\n   \n   \\[ -52x = -364 \\]\n\n4. Solve for \\( x \\):\n\n   \\[ x = \\frac{-364}{-52} \\]\n\n   Calculating this, let's see if it simplifies nicely. By dividing both numerator and denominator by -52, \n\n   \\[ x = 7 \\]\n\n**Check Work So Far:**\n\nHmm, that looks reasonable. Before I solve for \\( y \\), I'll quickly plug \\( x = 7 \\) back into the equation to make sure it satisfies:\n\nCheck using the second equation:\n\n\\[ 6(7) = 42 + y \\]\n\n\\[ 42 = 42 + y \\]\n\n\\[ y = 0 \\]\n\nWait, it seems off. Did I do somewhere wrong? Let me pause and think:\n\n- Substituting \\( x = 7 \\) in the first equation might clarify:\n\n\\[ 2(7) - 9y = 14 \\]\n\n\\[ 14 - 9y = 14 \\]\n\n\\[ -9y = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 0 \\]\n\nOkay, this aligns better now. \\( y = 0 \\) seems accurate, given my approach checks out.\n\n**Calculate \\( xy \\):**\n\nNow for the product:\n\n\\[ xy = 7 \\times 0 = 0 \\]\n\n**Final Thoughts and Checks:**\n\nGiven both substituted and original equations have been verified with these values, the computations seem robust. The final product \\( xy = 0 \\), while possibly unintuitive, seems consistent with all derived substitutions and computations here.\n\nI reached a consistent conclusion where \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\), leading to \\( xy = 0 \\).\n\nIt's always good to check the logic and calculations, and everything seems to fit! If anything felt off during the validation, I'd go back and reconsider each step, but for now, I'm confident in my solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Multiplying the first equation by 3, we find that $6x - 27y = 42$, or $6x = 42 + 27y$.  But also $6x = 42 + y$.  Thus we see immediately that $27y = y$, or $y=0$.  Therefore $xy = \\boxed{0}$."
