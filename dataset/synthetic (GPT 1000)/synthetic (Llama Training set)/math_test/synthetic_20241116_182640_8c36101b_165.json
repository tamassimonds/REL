  "problem": "An ambulance travels at 40 mph and can follow a 20-mile route making no stops to get to the hospital. A helicopter travels at one mile per minute, and the air route is 15 miles to get to the same hospital. However, the helicopter takes three minutes for takeoff and three minutes for landing. How many fewer minutes does it take for the helicopter to complete its trip (takeoff, flight and landing) than for the ambulance to complete its trip?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and break it down step by step.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem describes two modes of transportation: an ambulance and a helicopter, both taking different routes to a hospital. We want to find out how many fewer minutes it takes for the helicopter to complete its trip compared to the ambulance. Each has specific speeds and extra time considerations (takeoff/landing for the helicopter).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see this, I think it's just about calculating the travel times for each vehicle and then comparing them. The helicopter's takeoff and landing are adding time complications, so I need to remember to include those.\n\n**Breaking Down the Problem:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Ambulance Time:**\n\n   - The ambulance travels 20 miles at a speed of 40 mph.\n   - To find the time it takes for the ambulance, I'll use the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the numbers: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Time for ambulance} = \\frac{20 \\text{ miles}}{40 \\text{ mph}} = 0.5 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n   - Since we're looking for minutes, convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:\n     \\[\n     0.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Helicopter Time:**\n\n   - The helicopter's total travel time includes the air travel and the time for takeoff and landing.\n   - The helicopter travels 15 miles, and its speed is 1 mile per minute.\n   - Time in the air is simply 15 minutes since it's 1 mile per minute.\n   - Takeoff and landing time is 3 minutes each, so:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total takeoff and landing time} = 3 + 3 = 6 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Total time for helicopter:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total helicopter time} = 15 \\text{ air minutes} + 6 \\text{ minutes for takeoff and landing} = 21 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Compare the Times:**\n\n   - Now, I need to compare the times:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ambulance time} = 30 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Helicopter time} = 21 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate how many fewer minutes the helicopter takes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = 30 - 21 = 9 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWow, it seems straightforward when broken down! The helicopter indeed takes significantly less time due to its faster speed, even with the additional takeoff and landing time. The key here was carefully accounting for every time component.\n\nIf there's anything that seems off, it's good to recheck calculations, especially conversions and additional times, like takeoff/landing for the helicopter, but everything seems to add up correctly.\n\nSo, it takes 9 fewer minutes for the helicopter to complete its trip compared to the ambulance. \ud83d\ude0a",

  "ground_truth": "If the ambulance travels at 40 miles per hour and takes a 20 mile route to the hospital, it will take half an hour, or 30 minutes. The helicopter takes three minutes to take off, three minutes to land, and 15 minutes to travel to the hospital, for a total of 21 minutes. Therefore, it takes the helicopter $30 - 21 = \\boxed{9}$ fewer minutes to complete its trip."
