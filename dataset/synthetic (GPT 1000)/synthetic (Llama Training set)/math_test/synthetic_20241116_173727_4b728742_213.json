    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I'm reminded of similar problems involving product equalities. The problem gives us three product equalities involving the variables \\(j\\), \\(k\\), and \\(l\\): \\(jk = 24\\), \\(jl = 48\\), and \\(kl = 18\\). We need to find \\(j + k + l\\).\n\nAlright, my initial thought is to find expressions for \\(j\\), \\(k\\), and \\(l\\) that we can break down from these products. Maybe divide one equation by another? That seems like a common strategy for these types of problems.\n\nExploring Different Approaches:\n\n1. **Ratio Method:**\n   - From \\(jk = 24\\) and \\(jl = 48\\), I notice that dividing the second equation by the first could give a clue. Let's try that:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{jl}{jk} = \\frac{48}{24}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the fraction on the right gives:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{l}{k} = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad l = 2k\n     \\]\n\n2. **Substituting \\(l = 2k\\) into another equation:**\n   - Let's use the third equation \\(kl = 18\\):\n     \\[\n     k(2k) = 18\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     2k^2 = 18 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k^2 = 9 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k = 3\n     \\]\n   - Since \\(k\\) is positive, I pick \\(k = 3\\).\n\n3. **Find \\(l\\) using \\(k = 3\\):**\n   - Substituting \\(k = 3\\) into \\(l = 2k\\):\n     \\[\n     l = 2 \\times 3 = 6\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find \\(j\\) using \\(jk = 24\\):**\n   - Now that I know \\(k = 3\\), substitute it into the first equation \\(jk = 24\\):\n     \\[\n     j \\times 3 = 24 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad j = 8\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate \\(j + k + l\\):**\n   - Now I have \\(j = 8\\), \\(k = 3\\), and \\(l = 6\\). So, let's sum them up:\n     \\[\n     j + k + l = 8 + 3 + 6 = 17\n     \\]\n\nCheck Work:\n\nIt's crucial to verify the solution. Let's check if substituting back gives the correct products:\n- \\(jk = 8 \\times 3 = 24\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(jl = 8 \\times 6 = 48\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(kl = 3 \\times 6 = 18\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out! The answer \\(j + k + l = 17\\) is consistent with all the given product equations.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\nBased on the calculations and checks, the sum of \\(j + k + l\\) is indeed \\(\\boxed{17}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since $$j=\\frac{24}{k}=\\frac{48}{l}$$we have $l = 2k$. So $18\n= 2k^2$, which means that $9 = k^2$. Since $k$ has to be positive, this implies that $k = 3$. This means that $j = 8$, and $l = 6$. Hence $j+k+l = \\boxed{17}$.\n\nOR\n\nTake the product of the equations to get $jk\\cdot jl\n\\cdot kl = 24 \\cdot 48 \\cdot 18$. Thus $$(jkl)^2 = 20736.$$So $(jkl)^2 =\n(144)^2$, and we have $jkl = 144$. Therefore, $$j = \\frac{jkl}{kl} = \\frac{144}{18} = 8.$$From this it follows that $k=3$ and $l=6$, so the sum is $8+3+6=\\boxed{17}$."
