    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n- Looking at the function \\( g(x) = \\frac{3x+1}{x+8} \\), it reminds me of rational functions I've dealt with before. Rational functions often have asymptotes which can affect their ranges.\n- Initially, I'm thinking about the horizontal asymptote because the degrees of the numerator and the denominator are the same. It leads me to believe the horizontal asymptote is at \\( y = \\frac{3}{1} = 3 \\).\n- We also need to consider vertical asymptotes, which occur where the denominator is zero. In this case, \\( x = -8 \\) makes the denominator zero.\n\nWait, maybe listing out a few values will help clarify what\u2019s going on:\n\n- Okay, plug in some numbers around those key points:\n  - \\( g(0) = \\frac{3(0) + 1}{0 + 8} = \\frac{1}{8} \\)\n  - \\( g(1) = \\frac{3(1) + 1}{1 + 8} = \\frac{4}{9} \\)\n  - As \\( x \\to -8^+ \\), \\( g(x) \\to \\infty \\) (checking the behavior near the vertical asymptote)\n  - As \\( x \\to -8^- \\), \\( g(x) \\to -\\infty \\)\n\nOkay, so I feel like exploring the horizontal asymptote a bit more might be important.\n\n- Since there is a horizontal asymptote at \\( y = 3 \\), the function approaches but never quite reaches 3 as \\( x \\) goes to \\(\\pm \\infty\\).\n\nHmm, maybe thinking about if there are any values \\( g(x) \\) cannot take:\n- Typically, when dealing with rational functions with similar degree numerator and denominator, they can take all real values if they have no holes. But the horizontal asymptote might make it impossible for \\( g(x) = 3 \\).\n\nWait, let's try finding if \\(g(x) = 3\\):\n- Start by setting \\( \\frac{3x + 1}{x + 8} = 3 \\).\n- This leads to \\( 3x + 1 = 3(x + 8) \\).\n- Simplifying gives \\( 3x + 1 = 3x + 24 \\).\n- Wait, subtracting \\(3x\\) from both sides gives \\(1 = 24\\), a contradiction.\n\nAh, so \\( y = 3 \\) indeed isn\u2019t in the range. That makes sense since it's a horizontal asymptote the graph can approach but not reach.\n\nNow let's consider the full range:\n- Vertical behavior and horizontal asymptotes suggest the function\u2019s outputs cover all real numbers except for the horizontal asymptote value, 3.\n- Therefore, the range is:\n  \\(\\{y \\mid y \\in \\mathbb{R}, y \\neq 3\\} \\).\n\nLet me quickly think through if everything aligns:\n- We have the rational function behavior nailed down with asymptotic limits.\n- Verified the values the function cannot take via another approach (direct substitution and logical contradiction).\n\nThe answer makes sense. The range of the function \\( g(x) = \\frac{3x+1}{x+8} \\) is \\((-\\infty, 3) \\cup (3, \\infty)\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Solution #1\n\nTo determine the range, we suppose $y=\\frac{3x+1}{x+8}$ (where $x\\ne -8$) and see if we can solve for $x$:\n$$\\begin{array}{r r@{~=~}l}\n& y & (3x+1)/(x+8) \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & y(x + 8) & 3x + 1 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & yx + 8y & 3x + 1 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & x(y - 3) & 1 - 8y.\n\\end{array}$$This last equation gives a contradiction if $y=3$, since in this case it says that $0=-23$. Therefore, it is impossible for $g(x)$ to equal $3$ for any value of $x$. But for any value of $y$ other than $3$, the last equation can be solved to yield $x = \\frac{1-8y}{y-3}$, or, in other words, $g\\left(\\frac{1-8y}{y-3}\\right)=y$.\n\nTherefore, the range of $g(x)$ is $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{3\\} = \\boxed{(-\\infty,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)}$.\n\nSolution #2\n\nWe can rewrite $g(x)$ as follows:\n$$g(x) = \\frac{3x+1}{x+8} = \\frac{3x+24}{x+8}-\\frac{23}{x+8} = 3 - \\frac{23}{x+8}.$$Then we note that $x+8$ takes on all real values, so $\\frac{1}{x+8}$ takes on every value which is the reciprocal of some nonzero real number, i.e., $\\frac{1}{x+8}$ takes on all nonzero values. Accordingly, $3-\\frac{23}{x+8}$ takes on all values not equal to $3$.\n\nTherefore, the range of $g(x)$ is $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{3\\} = \\boxed{(-\\infty,3)\\cup(3,\\infty)}$."
