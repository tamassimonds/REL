    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. I\u2019m going to break it down step-by-step and think aloud as I work through it.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nThe question is asking about the total cost of the ice cream that Voldemort bought. We know he purchased $6.\\overline{6}$ ounces, and each ounce costs \\$0.60. My first thought is, \"Hmm, that decimal with repeating sixes might complicate things a bit.\"\n\n### Step 2: Explore Different Strategies\n\n1. **Direct Multiplication**: Just multiply the two numbers, $6.\\overline{6}$ by \\$0.60.\n2. **Simplification**: Convert $6.\\overline{6}$ into a fraction. This might make the multiplication easier.\n3. **Approximation**: Consider if there\u2019s a way to approximate the value, though it might not be exact.\n\nAt first glance, the transformation into a fraction seems like a promising route. Let\u2019s try it out.\n\n### Step 3: Converting $6.\\overline{6}$ into a Fraction\n\nThis repeating decimal can be a little tricky. \n\n- **Thinking aloud:** \"This looks like a recurring decimal I've seen before, which usually turns into a fraction. Let's see... $0.\\overline{6}$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$. Ah, this reminds me: could $6.\\overline{6}$ be expressed like a whole number plus a recurring decimal part?\"\n  \n- **Process:** $6.\\overline{6}$ is equivalent to $6 + 0.\\overline{6}$. We know $0.\\overline{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$. So:\n  \n  - $6.\\overline{6} = 6 + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{18}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{20}{3}$.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Multiplication\n\nNow we'll multiply $\\frac{20}{3}$ by \\$0.60 to get the total cost.\n\n- **Thinking aloud:** \"I hope this fraction makes the multiplication a bit cleaner. Time to see if it works out.\"\n\n#### Calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{3} \\times \\text{\\$0.60} = 20 \\times \\frac{0.60}{3}\n\\]\n\n- **Quick Check:** \"Hmm, it would be useful to turn \\$0.60 into a fraction as well.\"\n\n- \\$0.60 can be expressed as $\\frac{60}{100} = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nSo substitute back in:\n\n\\[\n20 \\times \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 20 \\times \\frac{3}{15} = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{20}{5} = 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Calculation\n\nThe total cost is calculated to be \\$4. Let's do a quick logic check to see if that makes sense.\n\n- 6 oz * \\$0.60 = \\$3.60\n- An additional 2/3 of an ounce (~0.66) * \\$0.60 = \\$0.40 (approximately)\n- Combine these: \\$3.60 + \\$0.40 \u2248 \\$4 (which fits our calculated result!)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEverything checks out, and I feel confident in this approach. So, Voldemort paid \\$4 for his ice cream. Reflecting back, simplifying the repeating decimal into a fraction really helped make the multiplication smoother!",

  "ground_truth": "First let's convert $6.\\overline{6}$ to a fraction. Let $p=6.\\overline{6}$ and multiply both sides of this equation by 10 to obtain $10p=66.\\overline{6}$. Subtracting the left-hand sides $10p$ and $p$ as well as the right-hand sides $66.\\overline{6}$ and $6.\\overline{6}$ of these two equations gives $9p=60$, which implies $p=20/3$. As we know, $0.60 = 6/10=3/5$. We multiply the two fractions to get $$\\frac{\\cancelto{4}{20}}{\\cancel{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\cancel{3}}{\\cancel{5}} = 4.$$Voldemort had to pay $\\boxed{\\$4}$ for the ice cream."
