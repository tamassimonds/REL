    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this. I'm looking at a parametric curve that seems a bit different than the usual y = ax^2 + bx + c form. Instead, \\( (x, y) = (t^2 + t, 2t - 1) \\) is given. Okay, how do we find the vertex here? Let me think this through.\n\n### First Thoughts:\n1. **Identify the problem again:** I'm dealing with a parametric equation representing a parabola. I need to find the vertex.\n2. **Compare this with typical problems:** This feels like when I've worked with parametric forms before, where I needed to eliminate parameter \\( t \\) to express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\).\n3. **Options on how to solve:** Either convert the parametric form to a normal quadratic form, or perhaps find vertex by some transformation or symmetry.\n\n**Approach 1: Eliminate \\( t \\) and find an equation for \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\).**\n\n- **Step 1:** Start by expressing \\( t \\) in terms of \\( x \\).\n  - Given \\( x = t^2 + t \\). This is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( t \\).\n\n- **Step 2:** Solve for \\( t \\) using the quadratic formula:\n  \\( t^2 + t - x = 0 \\)\n  - Here, \\( a = 1, b = 1, c = -x \\).\n  - Using the quadratic formula \\( t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\).\n  - \\( t = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4x}}{2} \\).\n\n- **Step 3:** Choose which \\( t \\) from \\( t = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4x}}{2} \\) or \\( t = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{1 + 4x}}{2} \\) fits within our context. As we work with real numbers and typical parabola forms, usually the positive root makes more sense for general curves unless specified otherwise. Here, let's use:\n  - \\( t = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4x}}{2} \\).\n\n- **Step 4:** Substitute \\( t \\) back into \\( y = 2t - 1 \\) to get \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\).\n  - \\( y = 2\\left(\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4x}}{2}\\right) - 1 \\).\n  - Simplifying: \\( y = -1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4x} - 1 = \\sqrt{1 + 4x} - 2 \\).\n\n**Review:** Wait, let's back up a bit. The square root can complicate finding a clear vertex directly. Maybe I should explore another approach.\n\n**Approach 2: Find the vertex using symmetry and derivatives directly in parametric form.**\n\n- **Step 1:** Consider the symmetry around the axis of the parabola. In traditional quadratic form, symmetry provides a direct path to the vertex calculation. Let's reflect on the vertex property:\n  - Observe the line of symmetry principle in parabolas. Typically \\( x = -b/2a \\) in standard form.\n\n- **Step 2:** Relate directly through known vertex form transformations.\n  - Compute derivative relationships or use geometric mean of initial points when implicit symmetry solutions don\u2019t immediately leap from the transformations. Ideally, symmetrically maximum or minimum \\( t \\) can be derived directly from derivatives or centering:\n\n  - **Reflect** suppose vertex occurs ideally at symmetrical defined t mid-point traditionally, around \\( t = -b/2a \\) solution in equivalent translations.\n  - \\[ f'(t)= (dx/dt)\\]\n  - \\[ 0 = 2t + 1 \\Rightarrow t = -1/2 \\]\n\n- **Step 3:** Use this value from derived \\( t \\) for both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n  - For vertex point \\( x \\),\n    - Compute at \\( t = -1/2 \\):\n    - \\( x = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2) = 1/4 - 1/2 = -1/4 \\).\n\n  - For vertex point \\( y \\),\n    - Also compute directly for functional value at derived midpoint:\n    - \\( y = 2(-1/2) - 1 = -1 - 1 = -2 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- My exploration solves to yield vertex \\((-1/4, -2)\\) implying computed symmetrically engaged vertex. Let's check numbers once more for potential numerical errors noticeable on limited reflection.\n- Thinking over options and verification \u2014 transformation fits normal symmetry expectations.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- This seems reasonable upon audit since derived values reach comparable symmetry conclusions matched typical transformations appropriately and yields consistent deductions from both geometric transformations and parametric detail.\n\nOkay, so my final answer is the vertex of the parabola is \\((-1/4, -2)\\). This accounts for all symmetries and derived exploration insights!",
