    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\n1. Understanding the problem requires recognizing that \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) must be integers such that their reciprocals are also integers. Immediately, this suggests that \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) must be equal to \\(\\pm 1\\). Why? Because only \\(1\\) and \\(-1\\) have reciprocals that are also integers. This is due to the fact that the reciprocal of \\(2\\) would be \\(0.5\\), the reciprocal of \\(3\\) would be \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), and so forth, none of which are integers.\n\n2. With this realization, we can narrow the possibilities significantly: \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) can either be \\(1\\) or \\(-1\\).\n\nStrategy:\n\n- List out potential combinations of \\((x, y, z)\\) using \\(1\\) and \\(-1\\).\n- Calculate \\(x + y + z\\) for each combination.\n- Count distinct sums.\n\nLet's systematically explore:\n\n1. Consider \\(x = 1\\):\n   - \\(x = 1, y = 1, z = 1 \\Rightarrow x+y+z = 3\\)\n   - \\(x = 1, y = 1, z = -1 \\Rightarrow x+y+z = 1\\)\n   - \\(x = 1, y = -1, z = 1 \\Rightarrow x+y+z = 1\\)\n   - \\(x = 1, y = -1, z = -1 \\Rightarrow x+y+z = -1\\)\n\n2. Consider \\(x = -1\\):\n   - \\(x = -1, y = 1, z = 1 \\Rightarrow x+y+z = 1\\)\n   - \\(x = -1, y = 1, z = -1 \\Rightarrow x+y+z = -1\\)\n   - \\(x = -1, y = -1, z = 1 \\Rightarrow x+y+z = -1\\)\n   - \\(x = -1, y = -1, z = -1 \\Rightarrow x+y+z = -3\\)\n\nNow check distinct sums:\n\n- Analyzing our results: \\(3, 1, -1, -3\\).\n\nReflection:\n\n- I started systematic exploration by generating combinations and calculating the sum. This approach seems correct and confirms that all combinations are covered.\n- The nature of this problem simplifies checking, as there are only 8 possible states.\n- My calculations and reasoning appear consistent and comprehensive, leading me to believe this approach is correct.\n\nConcluding:\n\n- The distinct integer sums are \\(3, 1, -1, -3\\).\n- Thus, there are 4 distinct possible values for \\(x + y + z\\).\n\nFinal answer:\n\nThere are 4 distinct values of \\(x + y + z\\) possible.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $x$ and $1/x$ are integers, we know that $x$ is an integer that divides 1 evenly.  Therefore, we must have $x = -1$ or $x = 1$. The same is true for $y$ and $z$. So, the possible sums are $3(-1) = -3$, $2(-1) + 1 = -1$, $2(1) + -1 = 1$ or $3(1) = 3$. So there are $\\boxed{4}$ possible values for the sum."
