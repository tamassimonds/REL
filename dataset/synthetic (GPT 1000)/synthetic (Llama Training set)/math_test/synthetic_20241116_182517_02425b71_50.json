This immediately reminds me of basic properties of absolute values. Absolute value equations usually have two scenarios because \\( |a| = b \\) translates to \\( a = b \\) or \\( a = -b \\). So I have a feeling this will result in two possible solutions for \\( x \\).\n\nLet me break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:**\n   - \\( |x-1| = 7 \\) implies that \\( x-1 \\) could be \\( 7 \\) or \\(-7\\).\n   - Why? Because the absolute value function measures the distance from zero on a number line, so both \\( 7 \\) and \\(-7\\) are a distance of \\( 7 \\) units away from zero.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Cases:**\n   - Case 1: \\( x - 1 = 7 \\).\n   - Case 2: \\( x - 1 = -7 \\).\n\n3. **Solving Each Case:**\n   - Case 1: \\( x - 1 = 7 \\)\n     - Add 1 to both sides: \\( x = 8 \\).\n     - Quick check: Plug back into the absolute value equation \\( |8-1| = |7| = 7 \\). This works.\n   - Case 2: \\( x - 1 = -7 \\)\n     - Add 1 to both sides: \\( x = -6 \\).\n     - Quick check: Plug back into the absolute value equation \\( |-6-1| = |-7| = 7 \\). This works too.\n\n4. **Summing the Values:**\n   - I have two values for \\( x \\): \\( 8 \\) and \\(-6\\).\n   - The question asks for the \"sum of all values of \\( x \\)\", which is \\( 8 + (-6) \\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Sum:**\n   - \\( 8 + (-6) = 2 \\).\n\n6. **Reflecting on the Solution:**\n   - Let's check if it makes sense. I had two values, which matched my expectations based on the nature of absolute value equations. The solutions satisfied the original equation, and my arithmetic for the sum seems correct.\n\n7. **Final Check:**\n   - Is there an easier way I missed? The method seems direct and suitable, given the simplicity of the equation. I also checked my quick calculations for correctness.\n\nSo, the sum of all values of \\( x \\) that satisfy \\( |x-1| = 7 \\) is \\( \\boxed{2} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "We must have either $x-1 = 7$ or $x-1=-7$.  If $x-1=7$, we have $x=8$, and if $x-1 = -7$, we have $x= -6$, so the sum of the possible values of $x$ is $8+(-6) = \\boxed{2}$."
