    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Just like solving any puzzle, it's crucial to break it down into manageable parts and explore various strategies before landing on the optimal one. Here's how we'll tackle this:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe need to choose a president, a vice-president, a secretary, and a treasurer from 15 club members. The roles cannot be combined, meaning each position must be held by a different member. I sense that this involves permutations because it's not just about choosing people, but also assigning them unique roles.\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorming Possible Approaches\n- **Permutations**: This seems fitting as we have to assign distinct roles. Once a person is chosen for a role, they can\u2019t hold another one, which suggests an order matters.\n- **Combinations**: This doesn't seem right here, since combinations ignore order and we're specifically assigning positions.\n  \nLet's explore the permutations route first because that seems the most logical given the problem structure.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Calculations Using Permutations\n- We have 15 unique positions for the president.\n- Once the president is chosen, 14 members remain. We choose one for vice-president.\n- After choosing a vice-president, 13 members remain for the position of secretary.\n- Finally, 12 remaining people for the treasurer position.\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\\[ 15 \\text{ choices of president } \\times 14 \\text{ choices of vice-president } \\times 13 \\text{ choices of secretary } \\times 12 \\text{ choices of treasurer} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Total Number of Ways\nLet\u2019s compute the total number of ways to assign all these roles:\n\\[ 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\]\n\nNow let's calculate this step by step:\n\\[ 15 \\times 14 = 210 \\]\nChecking quickly: yes this seems accurate knowing 15 times 14 is in that range.\n\\[ 210 \\times 13 = 2730 \\]\nBreaking this down further in my head:\n\\[ 210 \\times 10 = 2100 \\]\n\\[ 210 \\times 3 = 630 \\]\n\\[ 2100 + 630 = 2730 \\] \nLooks good mathematically.\n\\[ 2730 \\times 12 = 32760 \\]\nTo double-check this:\n\\[ 2730 \\times 10 = 27300 \\]\n\\[ 2730 \\times 2 = 5460 \\]\n\\[ 27300 + 5460 = 32760 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Reflecting on Results\nReflecting on the steps and results: It makes logical sense given the permutations approach with gradually decreasing members after each selection. The calculation seems correct upon re-evaluation. \n\n### Step 6: A Final Check\nReview the logic: We started with all members eligible for any role and subtracted one member from the pool for each subsequent role selection, ensuring distinct roles are filled properly. This confirms my understanding is along the right track.\n\nThus, the final answer is **32,760 ways** to assign these four roles to the club's members.\n\nIn conclusion, I think I\u2019ve applied the right strategy to the problem given the constraints and requirements. Always good to see how deductive reasoning, combined with mathematical calculation, leads us to the solution.",
