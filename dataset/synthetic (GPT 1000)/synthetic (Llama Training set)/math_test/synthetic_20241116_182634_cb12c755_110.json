    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst off, let's make sure we fully understand what the problem is asking. We have twelve friends who each ordered their own meal. The meals were so large that the total amount of food ordered was enough to feed 18 people. We're trying to figure out how many meals they should have ordered to have just enough food for just the 12 of them.\n\n### Brainstorming Approaches\n\n- **Proportionality Approach:** One possible starting point is to think about how much of a meal is \"enough\" for one person. If they ordered 12 meals and it was enough for 18 people, maybe there's a simple ratio involved here.\n\n- **Direct Calculation:** Another way could be to think about what fraction of a meal is needed to serve one person, given what we know about serving sizes.\n\nThinking about similar problems helps too. This feels like solving a problem involving ratios or fractions, something common in questions about resource distribution or optimization.\n\n### Start with Proportionality\n\nLet's begin with the proportionality approach:\n\n1. **Understand Current Scenario:** \n   - They ordered 12 meals.\n   - These 12 meals served 18 people.\n\n2. **Ratio of Meals to People Served:**\n   - We need to determine the ratio of how many people one meal can serve. If 12 meals serve 18 people, the fraction of a single meal that serves one person is `12/18` or simplified to `2/3` of a meal per person.\n\n3. **Reflect on Proportionality Step:** \n   - We have a direct relationship now: each meal serves 1.5 people (since 18/12 = 1.5).\n\n4. **Apply the Ratio for Desired Scenario:** \n   - If each meal serves 1.5 people, we need to calculate how many meals are necessary for 12 people.\n\n### Calculation\n\n- **Number of Meals Needed for 12 People:**\n  - If each meal serves 1.5 people, divide the total number of people (12) by how many people one meal can serve (1.5).\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Meals needed} = \\frac{12}{1.5} = 8\n  \\]\n\n### Check the Solution\n\nLet me double-check this:\n\n- If they order 8 meals, and each meal serves 1.5 people, the total number of people fed is:\n  \\[\n  8 \\times 1.5 = 12\n  \\]\n\nIt works! \n\n### Reflect\n\n- **Reasonableness:** Does the answer make sense? \n  - Yes, because we found the correct allocation of meals so that they match the number of people exactly.\n  \n- **Consistency Check:** \n  - The calculations are consistent with our understanding of proportional relationships.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, to have just enough food for the 12 of them, they should have ordered 8 meals. This solution aligns with both our proportional reasoning and the direct calculations. Our approach was consistent and our result verified through logical steps.",
