    "working_out": "### First Thoughts\n\nAlright, looking at the problem, we're dealing with a quadratic expression: \\(3x^2 + x - 4\\). We need to express it in the form \\(a(x - h)^2 + k\\). This is essentially the vertex form of a quadratic equation, which is useful for identifying the vertex of the parabola.\n\nInitial thoughts: This looks like a problem of completing the square. I remember seeing something similar in previous algebra problems where you transform a standard form quadratic equation into vertex form.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Remember the formula**: Vertex form looks like \\(a(x - h)^2 + k\\). Here, \\(a\\) should remain the same as in the standard form, so in our case, \\(a = 3\\).\n\n2. **Completing the square**: To convert a quadratic into vertex form, I'm thinking about completing the square for the quadratic expression. This should allow me to rewrite it in terms of a perfect square.\n\n3. **Distribute and balance**: Another method might involve rewriting the expression by distributing terms and balancing them to fit the required formula. \n\n4. **Substitution test**: A quick sanity check might be to substitute back any derived \\(x\\) in the original and vertex form equations to see if they match. This should tell me if the transformation holds true.\n\nOkay, let's try completing the square first and see where it takes us.\n\n### Step-by-Step Completion\n\n#### Step 1: Factor out the leading coefficient from the first two terms\nStart by writing out the given expression:\n\\[ 3x^2 + x - 4 \\]\n\nI need to factor out the 3 from the quadratic and linear terms:\n\\[ 3(x^2 + \\frac{1}{3}x) - 4 \\]\n\n#### Step 2: Complete the square inside the parentheses\nInside the parentheses, to complete the square for \\(x^2 + \\frac{1}{3}x\\), I'll take half of the linear coefficient, \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), square it, and add/subtract it inside:\n\nHalf of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\). Squaring gives \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36}\\).\n\nSo, add and subtract \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\) inside the parentheses:\n\\[ 3(x^2 + \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{1}{36} - \\frac{1}{36}) - 4 \\]\n\nReorganize to form a perfect square:\n\\[ 3((x + \\frac{1}{6})^2 - \\frac{1}{36}) - 4 \\]\n\n#### Step 3: Distribute and simplify\nDistribute the 3 back through:\n\\[ 3(x + \\frac{1}{6})^2 - 3 \\times \\frac{1}{36} - 4 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[ 3(x + \\frac{1}{6})^2 - \\frac{1}{12} - 4 \\]\n\nCombine the constant terms:\n\\[ 3(x + \\frac{1}{6})^2 - \\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{48}{12} \\]\n\n\\[ 3(x + \\frac{1}{6})^2 - \\frac{49}{12} \\]\n\n### Check Work\n\nI should double-check whether these steps accurately express the equation in vertex form. The original expression is represented differently now, with the necessary rearrangement to indicate a completed square followed by a re-calculated constant term \\(k\\).\n\n#### Verification\n\nIn vertex form, \\(k = -\\frac{49}{12}\\). This is just the shift of the parabola along the y-axis, given the conversion from standard to vertex form.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo, the value of \\(k\\) for the expression \\(3x^2 + x - 4\\) in the form \\(a(x - h)^2 + k\\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{-\\frac{49}{12}} \\] \n\nThis was a neat exercise\u2014I noticed that completing the square wasn't as complex as it initially seemed, and I should double-check with substitution occasionally to ensure accuracy.",

  "ground_truth": "We complete the square.  First, we factor 3 out of the terms $3x^2 + x$ to get $3 \\left( x^2 + \\frac{x}{3} \\right)$.  We can square $x + \\frac{1}{6}$ to get $x^2 + \\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{1}{36}$, so \\begin{align*}\n3 \\left( x^2 + \\frac{x}{3} \\right) &= 3 \\left[ \\left( x + \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{36} \\right]\\\\\n&= 3 \\left( x + \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 - \\frac{3}{36}\\\\\n& = 3 \\left( x + \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{12},\\end{align*}and \\begin{align*}3 \\left( x^2 + \\frac{x}{3} \\right) - 4 &= 3 \\left( x + \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{12} - 4\\\\\n& = 3 \\left( x + \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 - \\frac{49}{12}.\\end{align*}We see that $k = \\boxed{-\\frac{49}{12}}$."
