    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem and start with initial impressions. Given the question, we want to find the circumference of a circle with the center at \\( P(-2, 3) \\) and passing through \\( Q(10, -2) \\).\n\n### Brainstorming\n- **Initial Thought**: The problem seems to ask for the circumference of a circle. Basic geometry tells me that the circumference \\( C \\) of a circle is related to its radius \\( r \\) by the formula \\( C = 2\\pi r \\).\n\n- **Realization**: We need the radius of the circle here. Since \\( P \\) is the center and \\( Q \\) is a point on the circle, the distance \\( PQ \\) would be the radius.\n\n- **Oh! This reminds me of...**: I'm thinking of the distance formula. Yes, this seems like a familiar task where I can use the distance formula to find the radius.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1. **Distance Formula**: The distance between two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Applying to \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\)**:\n   - Here, \\( P(-2, 3) \\) and \\( Q(10, -2) \\).\n   - Substitute into the formula:\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{(10 - (-2))^2 + ((-2) - 3)^2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify Inside the Square Root**:\n   - Calculate the differences: \\( 10 - (-2) = 10 + 2 = 12 \\) and \\( -2 - 3 = -5 \\).\n   - Plug in these values:\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{12^2 + (-5)^2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Squares**:\n   - \\( 12^2 = 144 \\) and \\( (-5)^2 = 25 \\).\n   - Add these results: \\( 144 + 25 = 169 \\).\n   - So, \\( r = \\sqrt{169} = 13 \\).\n\n### Reflection\n- **Does this make sense?** The distance seems correct; using \\( 13 \\) as the radius feels reasonable.\n\n### Calculate Circumference\n- Now, use the circumference formula \\( C = 2\\pi r \\):\n  \\[\n  C = 2\\pi \\times 13 = 26\\pi\n  \\]\n\n### Verification\n- **Seems right!** A quick mental recap shows that all steps logically follow from the premises and the core geometry principles.\n\nFinal circumference in terms of \\( \\pi \\) is \\( \\boxed{26\\pi} \\). Everything fits logically, so this should be correct!\n\nLet me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore about this problem!",

  "ground_truth": "To find the circumference, we must first find the length of the radius, $PQ$. We can do this by using the distance formula or by noticing that the points $P$, $Q$, and $(-2, -2)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the hypotenuse $PQ$ must equal 13.\n\nNow that we know the radius has length 13, the circumference is $2 \\cdot 13 \\pi = \\boxed{26\\pi}$."
