    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it step by step. The problem is asking us to compute \\(\\tan \\left( \\arccos \\frac{1}{3} \\right)\\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem.**\n\nThe expression involves an inverse trigonometric function (\\(\\arccos\\)), which gives an angle whose cosine is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). We're asked to find the tangent of that angle. So essentially, if \\(\\theta = \\arccos \\frac{1}{3}\\), we need to compute \\(\\tan(\\theta)\\).\n\n**Initial thoughts:**\n\n1. Okay, so if we know \\(\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{3}\\), we could use the Pythagorean identity to find \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\), and then use \\(\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\).\n2. Another method could be using a right triangle approach where one side is the adjacent and another is the hypotenuse. \n\nHmm. I think using the identity method could be straightforward, let's start there.\n\n**Step 2: Using the Pythagorean Identity.**\n\nThe Pythagorean identity states that for any angle \\(\\theta\\),\n\n\\[\n\\cos^2(\\theta) + \\sin^2(\\theta) = 1\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{3}\\), let's substitute this into the identity:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + \\sin^2(\\theta) = 1\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\sin^2(\\theta)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{9} + \\sin^2(\\theta) = 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2(\\theta) = 1 - \\frac{1}{9}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{9}{9} - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root (considering that \\(\\theta\\) is in the range of \\(\\arccos\\), which outputs an angle between \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi\\), the sine should be positive):\n\n\\[\n\\sin(\\theta) = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{8}}{3} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check: Am I making sense so far?**\n\nLet's see if our substitution back into the Pythagorean identity works:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{8}{9} = 1\n\\]\n\nYes! Good sign, this holds true.\n\n**Step 3: Find \\(\\tan(\\theta)\\).**\n\nNow, since \\(\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}}{\\frac{1}{3}} = 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Hmm, this final answer seems reasonable. The steps checked out mathwise, and this question doesn't suggest an unusual trapping, like special angles or needing an unusual trick. Honestly, the \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) being a common fraction and fitting smoothly with \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) doesn\u2019t sound fishy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe value of \\(\\tan \\left( \\arccos \\frac{1}{3} \\right)\\) is \\(2\\sqrt{2}\\). After verifying the steps and performing checks, this should be the correct result.",
