    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and explore different approaches.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\n\nThe problem is asking for the product of the magnitudes of two complex numbers: \\( |10 - 13i| \\cdot |10 + 13i| \\). Initially, this seems like it could involve some properties of complex numbers. I recall that the magnitude of a complex number \\( a + bi \\) is \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Each Magnitude**\n\nLet's tackle the magnitudes one at a time:\n\n- For \\(10 - 13i\\):\n   \\[\n   |10 - 13i| = \\sqrt{10^2 + (-13)^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 169} = \\sqrt{269}\n   \\]\n   That seems straightforward. I\u2019ll note it down.\n\n- For \\(10 + 13i\\):\n   \\[\n   |10 + 13i| = \\sqrt{10^2 + 13^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 169} = \\sqrt{269}\n   \\]\n   Again, the same magnitude shows up. Interesting!\n\nIt seems both magnitudes are \\(\\sqrt{269}\\).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Product of Magnitudes**\n\nSo now, the problem specifically asks for the product of these magnitudes. That's:\n\\[\n|10 - 13i| \\cdot |10 + 13i| = \\sqrt{269} \\cdot \\sqrt{269} = (\\sqrt{269})^2\n\\]\n\nOh! That simplifies nicely:\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{269})^2 = 269\n\\]\n\nSeems quite straightforward after breaking it down. There\u2019s a clear logical flow in the calculations, and it aligns with my initial understanding of complex number properties. I\u2019ll double-check if there\u2019s another property or theorem that could offer the same solution.\n\n**Step 4: Reflect on the Properties**\n\nNow that we've finished the arithmetic, let's reflect:\n\nThere's a known result about products of complex numbers and their conjugates: \nThe product \\((a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2\\). So, in context:\n\\[\n(10 - 13i)(10 + 13i) = 10^2 + 13^2 = 100 + 169 = 269\n\\]\n\nThis matches perfectly with our calculation. \n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nEverything checks out, and that\u2019s reassuring! The initial approach using magnitudes followed by cross-verification via conjugate properties aligns well, providing a consistent and correct solution to the problem.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe product \\( |10 - 13i| \\cdot |10 + 13i| = 269 \\).",
