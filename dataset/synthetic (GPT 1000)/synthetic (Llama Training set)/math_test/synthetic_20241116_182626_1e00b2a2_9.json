    "working_out": "Let's dive into this problem where we need to find the modulus (magnitude) of a complex number \\( z \\) given that \\( z^4 = \\frac{64}{5} - \\frac{48}{5}i \\).\n\n### First Thoughts:\nMy initial reaction is to link this kind of problem with knowledge about the properties of complex numbers, particularly focusing on their polar form. The problem gives \\( z^4 \\), a complex number in rectangular form, so converting to polar might be helpful. The magnitude is often most accessible in polar form.\n\n#### Strategy Brainstorm:\n1. **Polar Form Conversion**: Converting \\( z^4 \\) into polar (or trigonometric) form might simplify finding the modulus.\n2. **Magnitude Property**: Remember, if \\( z^4 = w \\), then \\(|z^4| = |w|\\) can be used to find \\(|z|\\).\n3. **Rectangular Form Consideration**: While the expression is in rectangular form, exploring its polar counterpart could lend insight.\n4. **De Moivre's Theorem**: This could connect \\( |z| \\) to \\(|z^4| = |w|\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Exploration:\n1. **Find the Modulus of \\(w = z^4\\)**: \n   \\[\n   w = \\frac{64}{5} - \\frac{48}{5}i \n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\(|w|\\)**:\n   \\[\n   |w| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{64}{5}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{48}{5}\\right)^2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Expression for \\(|w|\\)**:\n   - First, calculate the squares:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{64}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4096}{25} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left(-\\frac{48}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2304}{25}\n   \\]\n\n   - Add these:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4096}{25} + \\frac{2304}{25} = \\frac{6400}{25} = 256\n   \\]\n\n   - Calculate the square root:\n   \\[\n   |w| = \\sqrt{256} = 16\n   \\]\n   \n   This makes sense for \\(|w|\\) being the modulus, as 16 seems reasonable and not overly complicated.\n\n4. **Calculate \\(|z|\\) from \\(|z^4|\\)**:\n   - Using the property \\( |z^4| = |z|^4 \\), and knowing \\(|z^4| = 16\\):\n   \\[\n   |z|^4 = 16 \n   \\]\n\n   - Solve for \\(|z|\\):\n   \\[\n   |z| = \\sqrt[4]{16} = 2\n   \\]\n\n### Verification:\n- **Magnitude Check**: Verifying that \\( |z| = 2 \\) is logically sound from both mathematical simplification and practical outcomes within the complex plane accents that previous steps have calculated correctly.\n\n### Reflection:\n- Always consider polar forms for simplifying complex magnitude or angle issues.\n- De Moivre\u2019s theorem makes \\( (|z|^4 = |w|) \\) an effective approach.\n- Verification is a necessary component; re-evaluating each calculation against typical benchmarks prevents oversight.\n\nFinally, my intuition for using magnitudes alone confirmed the operation\u2019s thoughtful structure and logic, demonstrating resilience and insight was well-placed.\n\nThus, the magnitude or modulus \\(|z|\\) is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",
