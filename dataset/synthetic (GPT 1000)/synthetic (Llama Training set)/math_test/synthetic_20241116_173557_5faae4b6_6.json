    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this. At first glance, we have a set of equations involving exponential forms, and we're asked to find the product \\( a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d \\). These equations look like they connect to a concept I'm familiar with - transformation of exponential equations through logarithms or powers. Right when I see 'exponential' raised to a power equals some integer, my mind jumps to logarithms as tools for handling these.\n\nLet's restate what we're given:\n\n1. \\( 4^a = 5 \\)\n2. \\( 5^b = 6 \\)\n3. \\( 6^c = 7 \\)\n4. \\( 7^d = 8 \\)\n\nOur goal is to find \\( a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d \\).\n\n### Step 1: Express in Logarithmic Form\n\nMy first thought is to use logarithms to try to express \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\). Taking the logarithm of both sides of each equation (I'll use natural logarithms for convenience, but any logarithmic base would technically work):\n\n1. \\( a = \\frac{\\ln 5}{\\ln 4} \\)\n2. \\( b = \\frac{\\ln 6}{\\ln 5} \\)\n3. \\( c = \\frac{\\ln 7}{\\ln 6} \\)\n4. \\( d = \\frac{\\ln 8}{\\ln 7} \\)\n\nEach variable is now expressed in terms of logarithms of numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Product \\( a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d \\)\n\nThis insightful move clicks\u2014if I multiply all these expressions together:\n\n\\[ a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = \\left(\\frac{\\ln 5}{\\ln 4}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\ln 6}{\\ln 5}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\ln 7}{\\ln 6}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\ln 8}{\\ln 7}\\right) \\]\n\nHere, suddenly an 'aha moment' hits: the numerators and denominators will cancel out in a very elegant telescoping manner:\n\n- The \\( \\ln 5 \\) in the denominator of \\( a \\) cancels with the \\( \\ln 5 \\) in the numerator of \\( b \\).\n- The \\( \\ln 6 \\) in the denominator of \\( b \\) cancels with the \\( \\ln 6 \\) in the numerator of \\( c \\).\n- The \\( \\ln 7 \\) in the denominator of \\( c \\) cancels with the \\( \\ln 7 \\) in the numerator of \\( d \\).\n\nWhat's left is:\n\n\\[ a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = \\frac{\\ln 8}{\\ln 4} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify \\( \\frac{\\ln 8}{\\ln 4} \\)\n\nNow the quick check: \\( \\ln 8 \\) and \\( \\ln 4 \\) are related straightforwardly because:\n\n- \\( 8 = 2^3 \\)\n- \\( 4 = 2^2 \\)\n\nThus, \\( \\ln 8 = 3\\ln 2 \\) and \\( \\ln 4 = 2\\ln 2 \\). So:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\ln 8}{\\ln 4} = \\frac{3\\ln 2}{2\\ln 2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nThis matches all through, no straggling factors or unaccounted cancellations. The telescopic nature really simplifies itself neatly to this fraction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFinally, breathing a sigh of relief\u2014it all makes sense and matches neatly\u2014I've calculated:\n\n\\[ a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d = \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nThis confirms the approach works solidly, and I've checked for any overlooked mishaps. I'm confident in this result\u2014so, let's go ahead and finalize: The answer to the problem is \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Because \\[\n4^{a\\cdot b\\cdot c\\cdot d}\n= \\left(\\left(\\left(4^a\\right)^b\\right)^c\\right)^d\n= \\left(\\left( 5^b\\right)^c\\right)^d\n= \\left(6^c\\right)^d = 7^d = 8 = 4^{3/2},\n\\]we have $a\\cdot b\\cdot c\\cdot d = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$."
