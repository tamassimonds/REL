    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- This problem involves subsets of a set that consist only of prime numbers. So, the first task is to identify the prime numbers within the given set.\n- The set given is \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\\}\\).\n- I recognize that some of these numbers are prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.\n\nIdentifying Prime Numbers:\n- Let\u2019s go through each number to determine if it\u2019s prime.\n  - 1 is not a prime number.\n  - 2 is a prime number (divisible only by 1 and 2).\n  - 3 is a prime number (divisible only by 1 and 3).\n  - 4 is not prime (divisible by 2).\n  - 5 is a prime number (divisible only by 1 and 5).\n  - 6 is not prime (divisible by 2 and 3).\n  - 7 is a prime number (divisible only by 1 and 7).\n  - 8 is not prime (divisible by 2).\n  - 9 is not prime (divisible by 3).\n  - 10 is not prime (divisible by 2).\n  - 11 is a prime number (divisible only by 1 and 11).\n\nList of Primes:\n- From the original set, the prime numbers are \\(\\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11\\}\\).\n\nSubset Considerations:\n- Next, I need to find all possible non-empty subsets composed only of these prime numbers.\n- This reminds me of the concept of the power set of a set of elements, which includes all possible subsets. For a set with \\(n\\) elements, there are \\(2^n\\) total subsets, including the empty set.\n\nCalculation of Total Non-Empty Subsets:\n- The set of prime numbers we identified has \\(5\\) elements: \\(\\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11\\}\\).\n- The total number of subsets for a set with 5 elements is \\(2^5 = 32\\).\n- This count includes the empty set. Therefore, to find the non-empty subsets, I need to subtract the empty set from this total.\n- Non-empty subsets: \\(32 - 1 = 31\\).\n\nChecking the Calculation:\n- Quick check: The number \\(31\\) is consistent with the understanding that subtracting the single empty subset leaves all the possible meaningful combinations of the prime numbers.\n- This approach seems reasonable as there are no overlaps or exclusions that would change the count beyond this.\n\nConclusion:\n- The number of non-empty subsets of \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\\}\\) that consist entirely of prime numbers is \\(\\boxed{31}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We consider the subset $\\{ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 \\}$ which consists only of the prime integers in the original set. Any subset consisting entirely of prime numbers must be a subset of this particular subset. And, there are $2^5 - 1 = \\boxed{31}$ non-empty subsets of this 5-element set, which we can easily see by making the choice of including or not including each element."
