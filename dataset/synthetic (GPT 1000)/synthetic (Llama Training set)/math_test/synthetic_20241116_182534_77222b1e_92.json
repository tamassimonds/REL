    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. \n\n**Step 1: Understanding the problem**\n\nThe equation given is \\(9x^3 - 20x = 8\\sqrt{2}\\). We need to find the largest solution expressed in the form \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b}}{c}\\). This indicates we're dealing with a solution involving radicals, which hints at the possibility of simplifying the equation or using a substitution. \n\n**Step 2: Exploring strategies**\n\nInitially, I consider if direct algebraic methods or substitutions could simplify. Suppose \\(x\\) might be expressed as a combination of radicals, as the problem suggests a solution in that form. Maybe a substitution or transformation can help here. A substitution such as \\(x = k + \\frac{m}{n}\\) doesn\u2019t seem immediately applicable due to the radicals, so maybe expressing \\(x\\) directly with a radical substitution like \\(x = \\frac{\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b}}{c}\\) is more viable. Let's find out more details.\n\n**Step 3: Attempting a Substitution**\n\nLet's see if symmetric nature around a certain value helps. Often, such expressions result from some symmetry, where the pivotal point can help redefine the approach:\n\nTry \\(x = \\cos \\theta\\) or \\(x = \\frac{\\sqrt{m} + \\sqrt{n}}{p}\\) type of angles, as sinusoidal relationships often simplify cubic expressions.\n\n**Step 4: Testing Possible Approaches**\n\nSubstitution:\n- \\(x^3\\) naturally hints at trigonometric simplifications if periodic forms apply.\n- Trying the typical \\(\\cos \\theta\\) substitution didn\u2019t simplify on initial trials (often seen in problems where they cancel sine terms).\n\nRefocusing on \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b}}{c}\\), we directly solve for typical substitutions in quadratic terms.\n\n**Step 5: Manipulate and Simplify**\n\nNotice if the equation represents some known identity formation indicative of completing cube forms or simplifications:\n\nTransform the main equation:\n\\[ 9x^3 - 20x = 8\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nTry factoring:\n\\[ 9x(x^2 - \\frac{20}{9}) = 8\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nNo typical factorisation unless intentionally rearranged with known variable substituents\u2014checking roots might give an angle here.\n\nUnknowns here show derivative checks might simplify estimates about rational properties.\n\n**Step 6: Quadratic Angle**\n\nPossible expansions:\n- Try for smaller terms to check zero:\n\\[ x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{m}}{n} \\]\n\nExpansion might not bear roots - switching:\n\\[ y = \\sqrt{2}x \\] gives a potential simplification through expanded property analysis.\n\nStop: Evaluate a new scenario\n- Calculations suggests a trial root or harmonic simplification upon checks.\n\n---\n\n**Aha Moment**\n\nRealizing meaningful solutions quantitively rely on symmetry tells us a solution likely reduces back into something simpler possibly through trigonometric identities or identified through checking actual values straight from radicals.\n\n- Check actual meaningful estimate derivation or get to zero polynomial:\n\nVia trial and clean algebraic simplification:\n\nLet's recalculate:\n\\[ x=\\frac{\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{10}}{6} \\]\n\nSimplifying through guess-checking yields viable digits confirmable long divisional factors with additional cross-checking conventional solving for zero derivative positions in factor polynomial.\n\n**Final Insight**\n\nThe existence of reasonably distinct radicals fulfilling polynomial standards means resolving:\n- Start with precise solved radicals, confirming counting a, b, c values as proposed forms suitable symmetry solutions bring.\n  \nRe-check final expression assurance or stylist modified trials on simplifying outcomes:\n\n**Solution:**\n\nFind corresponding simplified values for \\(a, b, c\\) giving correct:\n- Ultimately calculate: \\( 6 + 10 + 6 = 22 \\).\n\nRevisiting and cross-examining verify these input calculations to form precise sufficient radical constants, finalized detoured perspectives assured tractable task completion.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous attempt. Let's re-evaluate this problem carefully and find the correct solution.\n\nFirst, let's recall the original equation:\n\n\\[ 9x^3 - 20x = 8\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\n### Step 1: Reconsider the Form and Approach\n\nInitially, I missed converting the problem into a potential simpler form that might reveal underlying roots more clearly.\n\nLet's redefine \\(x\\) with a substitution to make the equation more tractable:\n\n### Step 2: Substitution and Simplification\n\nSuppose \\(x = y\\sqrt{2}\\). Substituting into the equation gives:\n\n\\[ 9(y\\sqrt{2})^3 - 20(y\\sqrt{2}) = 8\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nSimplify and divide through by \\(\\sqrt{2}\\):\n\n\\[ 18y^3 - 20y = 8 \\]\n\nNow divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:\n\n\\[ 9y^3 - 10y = 4 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Simplified Cubic Equation\n\nLet's try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. Assuming \\(y = -\\frac{2}{3}\\):\n\nPlugging \\(y = -\\frac{2}{3}\\) into the cubic equation:\n\n\\[ 9\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 - 10\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) - 4 = 0 \\]\n\nUpon checking, \\(y = -\\frac{2}{3}\\) is indeed a solution. So we factor \\(3y + 2\\) from the cubic equation:\n\n\\[ (3y + 2)(3y^2 - 2y - 2) = 0 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Quadratic\n\nFocus on the quadratic part:\n\n\\[ 3y^2 - 2y - 2 = 0 \\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\(y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 3, b = -2, c = -2\\):\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 \\times 3 \\times (-2)}}{2 \\times 3} \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 24}}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{28}}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{7}}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{7}}{3} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Translate Back to \\(x\\) and Solve for the Largest Solution\n\nThe solutions for \\(y\\) translate to:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{y\\sqrt{2}}{1} = \\sqrt{2}y \\]\n\nThus, solutions for \\(x\\) are:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(-\\frac{2}{3})} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(1 \\pm \\sqrt{7})}{3} \\]\n\nGiven the context of the problem, the largest solution is:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{14}}{3} \\]\n\n### Step 6: Confirm and Conclude\n\nThis solution aligns with a typical form as given in the problem, \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b}}{c}\\), where \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 14\\), \\(c = 3\\).\n\nThus, the sum \\(a + b + c\\) is:\n\n\\[ 2 + 14 + 3 = \\boxed{19} \\]\n\nRe-evaluating and working through this process has led to the correct solution.
