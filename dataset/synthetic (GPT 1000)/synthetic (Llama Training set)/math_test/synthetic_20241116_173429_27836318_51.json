    "working_out": "Alright, let's work through this problem in a comprehensive, natural way. I'll try to reflect my thought process at each step, just like I would when solving it in real time.\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts: \n\n- I'm looking at a coordinate geometry problem. My initial thought is that it asks for the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment.\n- It's been a while since I've worked directly with midpoints, but I remember the formula involves averaging the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the points that define the line segment.\n\n**Step 1: Recalling the Midpoint Formula**\n\n- Let's think about the midpoint formula. For two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\), the midpoint \\((x_m, y_m)\\) is given by:\n\n  \\[\n  x_m = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\quad y_m = \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- An \"aha\" moment: The key here is averaging each coordinate. This feels correct because midpoints are supposed to be the average position between two endpoints.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Points and Use the Formula**\n\n- The points given are \\( (5, 4) \\) and \\( (-9, 8) \\).\n\n- Calculate the midpoint's x-coordinate:\n  \\[\n  x_m = \\frac{5 + (-9)}{2} = \\frac{5 - 9}{2} = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2\n  \\]\n\n- Quick sanity check: \\(5 + (-9)\\) indeed equals \\(-4\\); yes, this works. \\( -4 \\div 2 = -2 \\), so that checks out.\n\n- Calculate the midpoint's y-coordinate:\n  \\[\n  y_m = \\frac{4 + 8}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n  \\]\n\n- Quick check for y: \\(4 + 8 = 12\\) and dividing by 2 gives 6. Looks good.\n\n**Step 3: Sum the Midpoint Coordinates**\n\n- Now we need the sum of the x and y coordinates of the midpoint: \n  \\[\n  -2 + 6 = 4\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection and Final Check**\n\n- Let's think about whether this makes sense: The midpoint idea of averaging sounds right, and the calculations don\u2019t seem to have any glaring errors. \n- The sum of the coordinates is 4. It's important to double-check if that was what the question precisely asked for, and yes, it was the sum of the midpoint's coordinates.\n\n- Double-check: Going over each step, everything holds up upon re-calculation.\n\nSo, the final result, the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of the line segment connecting the points \\((5, 4)\\) and \\((-9, 8)\\), is indeed 4.",

  "ground_truth": "The midpoint is $\\left(\\frac{5-9}{2},\\frac{4+8}{2}\\right)$. Therefore, the sum of its coordinates is $\\frac{5-9+4+8}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = \\boxed{4}$."
