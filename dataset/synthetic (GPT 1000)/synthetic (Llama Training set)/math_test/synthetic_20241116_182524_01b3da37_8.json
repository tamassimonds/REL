    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, this is a combinatorics problem where we need to determine how many different combinations can be formed under certain constraints.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n- The lock has 5 digits, each ranging from 0 to 9.\n- No repeated digits are allowed, making this a permutation problem rather than a combination problem.\n- I've encountered similar problems before, so this reminds me of counting permutations with restrictions.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n- **Approach 1: Brute Force**: List all possible combinations and eliminate those with repeated digits. But, this seems inefficient due to the high number of possibilities.\n- **Approach 2: Systematic Counting**: Utilize permutation formulas, considering the restriction of no digit repetition. This should be more effective.\n\n### Choosing an Approach\nThe systematic counting method seems promising since dealing with 10 digits and 5 positions directly with permutations can give us the answer efficiently. Let\u2019s try this out.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n1. **First Digit**: \n   - We can choose any of the 10 digits (0 to 9).\n   - So, there are 10 options for the first digit.\n\n2. **Second Digit**: \n   - Since digits can't repeat, we\u2019re left with 9 options after choosing the first digit.\n\n3. **Third Digit**:\n   - At this point, 2 digits have been used, so 8 choices remain.\n\n4. **Fourth Digit**:\n   - From what\u2019s left of the digits, 7 choices remain.\n\n5. **Fifth Digit**:\n   - Lastly, 6 choices are left for the final digit.\n\n### Total Number of Permutations\nUsing the Rule of Product (or multiplication principle) in combinatorics:\n\\[ \\text{Total Permutations} = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\]\n\n### Let's Calculate\n\\[ 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\]\n\\[ 90 \\times 8 = 720 \\]\n\\[ 720 \\times 7 = 5040 \\]\n\\[ 5040 \\times 6 = 30240 \\]\n\n### Final Thoughts and Checks\n- The calculation seems correct given the constraints and my approach. \n- Each step logically followed from the rules given (no repeated digits, 5 slots to fill).\n- Reflecting on the math: It's like drawing without replacement.\n- The number appears reasonable given the base 10 system and restrictions.\n\nThere are \\( \\textbf{30,240} \\) possible valid codes for this lock. The strategy of systematic counting through permutations has led us to a solution that aligns with the problem constraints efficiently.\n\nIf I double-check any uncertainties or think there might be another perspective, the answer should still hold steady because each digit was considered precisely. But from what I can tell, this approach should be robust for this problem type.",

  "ground_truth": "For his first digit, Benjamin has 10 possible choices. For his second digit, he has 9 possible choices, since he cannot repeat any digits. For his third, fourth, and fifth digits, he has 8, 7, and 6 possible choices. Therefore, there are $10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{30,\\!240}$ possible codes."
