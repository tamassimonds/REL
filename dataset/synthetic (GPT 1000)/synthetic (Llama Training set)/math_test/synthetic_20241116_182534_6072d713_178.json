    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\nAs I take a first glance at this problem, my task is to find out how many numbers exist in the list starting from 36 and ending at 93. This does appear familiar, reminding me of problems from arithmetic sequences or range calculations. \n\nOne strategy that comes to mind is using the properties of sequences. I remember that the difference between consecutive integers in such lists is constant, which in this case is 1. This could mean that the list is comparable to a simple arithmetic sequence, and I just need to figure out the 'number of terms'.\n\nExploring different strategies:\n\n1. **Direct Counting**: One straightforward method is to count each number manually, but given that the numbers range from 36 to 93, doing this by hand seems tedious and prone to errors.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Sequence Formula**: I recall that we can calculate the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence by using the formula \\( n = \\frac{a_n - a_1}{d} + 1 \\), where:\n   - \\( a_n \\) is the last term (93),\n   - \\( a_1 \\) is the first term (36),\n   - \\( d \\) is the common difference between terms (1).\n\nLet's go ahead and try to apply this second approach since it seems more systematic. \n\nCalculation:\n\nGiven:\n- \\( a_1 = 36 \\)\n- \\( a_n = 93 \\)\n- \\( d = 1 \\)\n\nPlugging it into the formula:  \n\\[ n = \\frac{93 - 36}{1} + 1 \\]\n\nLet's compute this step-by-step:\n- First, calculate \\( 93 - 36 \\): This is 57. \n- Then divide by the common difference, which is 1. So, \\( \\frac{57}{1} = 57 \\). \n- Finally, add 1 to account for the starting number itself being included, resulting in 57 + 1 = 58.\n\nReflections and Checks:\n\nLet's pause to verify if this makes sense. The values plugged into the formula fit the setup of an arithmetic sequence, and every step aligns with my logical understanding of it. \n\nPerhaps a quick sanity check using a different method: \n\n- **Checking Boundary Values**: The numbers start at 36 and end at 93. By checking the sequence for smaller steps, for instance from 36 to 46, I note that these transitions confirm my understanding\u2014each increment is accounted for by adding 1 through each cycle.\n\n- **List Length Estimation**: By considering smaller lists, like from 1 to 10 (10 numbers) or 5 to 10 (6 numbers), the arithmetic method\u2019s reliability seems confirmed on how inclusive boundaries affect the count.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe process and result feel correct. My final answer is that there are 58 numbers in the list from 36 to 93.",
