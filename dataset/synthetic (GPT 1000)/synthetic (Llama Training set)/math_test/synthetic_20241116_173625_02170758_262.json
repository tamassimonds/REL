  "problem": "Sam decides to start a rumor. Sam tells the rumor to her three friends. Each of Sam's three friends then tells the rumor to three friends who have not heard the rumor. This continues for five total cycles. Sam telling her three friends was the first cycle. How many people, not including Sam, will have heard the rumor when the fifth cycle is complete?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about spreading rumors. At first glance, this looks like a classic problem involving exponential growth. Sam starts a rumor, and then each friend tells more friends, and so forth. Let\u2019s break it down step by step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\nFirst, I need to understand how many people are involved in each cycle and how this number grows. It's a bit like a tree - Sam at the top, her friends branching out, and so forth.\n\n1. **Cycle 1**: Sam tells 3 friends. \n\n2. **Cycle 2**: Each of those 3 friends tells 3 more friends. But wait, let\u2019s clarify\u2026 they tell 3 friends who haven't heard the rumor yet. So it doesn't loop back.\n\n3. **Cycle 3**: Each friend in cycle 2 tells 3 new people, and the cycle continues.\n\nHmm, this kind of reminds me of how binary trees multiply, though it's not binary here; it's ternary since each person is telling 3 friends.\n\n### Breaking Down Each Cycle:\n\n- **Cycle 1**: 3 friends hear it.\n  \n- **Cycle 2**: Those 3 tell 3 each: that's \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) new people.\n\n- **Cycle 3**: Those 9 then tell 3 each: \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\) new people.\n\n- **Cycle 4**: Those 27 tell 3 each: \\(27 \\times 3 = 81\\) new people.\n\n- **Cycle 5**: Those 81 tell 3 each: \\(81 \\times 3 = 243\\) new people.\n\nI see a pattern here, classic geometric progression. Plan: compute how many people have heard the rumor by the end of cycle 5.\n\n### Reflect and Check:\nThis feels like multiplying by powers of 3 except we don't include Sam herself. Each cycle seems like it just takes the previous number of people who knew and multiplies by 3 to add new ones.\n\nNow, I'll check by calculating how many have been told excluding Sam by the end of each cycle:\n\n- Total after Cycle 1: 3\n- Total after Cycle 2: \\(3 + 9 = 12\\)\n- Total after Cycle 3: \\(12 + 27 = 39\\)\n- Total after Cycle 4: \\(39 + 81 = 120\\)\n- Total after Cycle 5: \\(120 + 243 = 363\\)\n\nThe question asks for how many people excluding Sam will have heard it, which confirms my work up until now.\n\n### Checking Logic Around Cycles:\nReassuring myself, it feels correct because the math checks out following the geometric pattern. It makes sense given how virus spreading models work similarly: each individual shares the rumor with exactly 3.\n\n### Concluding:\nYes, I'm confident this is correct. After reflecting, I see the method I used follows the logical progression of a geometric series, and the math checks out across each step.\n\n**Final Answer**: By the end of the fifth cycle, 363 people, excluding Sam, will have heard the rumor.",

  "ground_truth": "At the end of one cycle, 3 people have heard the rumor.  At the end of two cycles, $3+9$ people have heard the rumor.  At the end of three cycles, $3+9+27$ people have heard the rumor, and so on.  At the end of five cycles, $3+9+27+81+243=\\boxed{363}$ people have heard the rumor.\n\nNote: The formula \\[\na+ar+ar^2+\\cdots+ar^{n-1}=\\frac{ar^{n}-a}{r-1}\n\\] for the sum of a geometric series may be used to sum $3^1+3^2+\\cdots+3^5$."
