    "working_out": "Alright, let's start by really understanding the problem here. We need to find the digit \\( n \\) in the number \\( 374n \\) so that the entire number is divisible by 18. \n\nFirst thoughts: \n\n- **Divisibility by 18** means the number must be divisible by both 2 and 9. I remember from school that for divisibility by 2, the number must end in an even digit, while for divisibility by 9, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9. \n\n- The number currently looks like this: \\( 374n \\), so I will have to manipulate or check for these divisibility conditions to find \\( n \\).\n\nLet's first focus on **divisibility by 2** since that's usually simpler:\n\n1. The number must end in an even digit. Thus, \\( n \\) must be even. \n\n   - Possible values for \\( n \\): 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. \n\nNow, checking for **divisibility by 9** is what potentially makes this more complex. For divisibility by 9, the sum of the digits of \\( 374n \\) must be a multiple of 9.\n\n2. The current sum of the digits without \\( n \\) is 3 + 7 + 4 = 14. \n\n3. So, \\( 14 + n \\) must be divisible by 9. \n\nLet's explore each of these even \\( n \\) possibilities:\n\n- \\( n = 0 \\): Sum of digits \\( = 14 + 0 = 14 \\). 14 is not divisible by 9.\n- \\( n = 2 \\): Sum of digits \\( = 14 + 2 = 16 \\). 16 is not divisible by 9.\n- \\( n = 4 \\): Sum of digits \\( = 14 + 4 = 18 \\). 18 is divisible by 9. Found a potential candidate: \\( n = 4 \\).\n- \\( n = 6 \\): Sum of digits \\( = 14 + 6 = 20 \\). 20 is not divisible by 9.\n- \\( n = 8 \\): Sum of digits \\( = 14 + 8 = 22 \\). 22 is not divisible by 9.\n\nReflecting on this, it seems like \\( n = 4 \\) is the only possibility where the sum of the digits is divisible by 9. But let's quickly verify everything to ensure I haven't made any mistakes in my calculations. \n\n**Verification:**\n\n- With \\( n = 4 \\), the number becomes 3744.\n- Sum of digits \\( = 3 + 7 + 4 + 4 = 18 \\), which is divisible by 9.\n- The last digit is 4, which is even, confirming divisibility by 2.\n\nAs everything checks out, the correct value for the unit digit \\( n \\) that makes \\( 374n \\) divisible by 18 is \\( n = 4 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\( n = 4 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "We know that the prime factorization of 18 is $2\\cdot 3^2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9 as well. Thus, $3+7+4+n$, or $14+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $14+n=18$, and $n=18-14=\\boxed{4}$."
