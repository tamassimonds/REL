    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\nOkay, this problem reminds me of classic algebraic substitution problems. It feels like we're dealing with a system of equations here. But honestly, my brain is racing a bit because there are three items involved: a sombrero, flip-flops, and sunglasses. Immediately, I'm drawn to let each item be represented by a variable: let's say \\( S \\) for sombrero, \\( F \\) for flip-flops, and \\( G \\) for sunglasses. From there, we can form different equations based on the information given.\n\nBrainstorming and Exploring Strategies:\n\nStrategy 1: System of Equations\n\n1. We have three equations based on the three purchasing scenarios:\n   - Sombrero and flip-flops: \\( S + F = 32 \\)\n   - Flip-flops and sunglasses: \\( F + G = 42 \\)\n   - Sombrero and sunglasses: \\( S + G = 30 \\)\n\n2. A common approach is to add or subtract equations to eliminate variables and solve for one of them.\n\nWait, that might be overcomplicated. Let's pause and explore if another simpler method might work...\n\nStrategy 2: Simplified Substitution\n\n1. Looking at the equations, I realize that we can potentially use substitution here. If I can express one of the items in terms of another, substitution might simplify the problem!\n\n2. From the first equation, \\( S + F = 32 \\), rearrange to express \\( S = 32 - F \\).\n\n3. Substitute \\( S = 32 - F \\) into the third equation \\( S + G = 30 \\):\n   \\[\n   (32 - F) + G = 30\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives us:\n   \\[\n   G = F - 2\n   \\]\n\nQuick Check:\n\nThis derivation seems correct because I have managed to express sunglasses in terms of flip-flops. Let's backtrack to ensure I'm on track...\n\n4. Substitute \\( G = F - 2 \\) into the second equation \\( F + G = 42 \\):\n   \\[\n   F + (F - 2) = 42\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   2F - 2 = 42 \\implies 2F = 44 \\implies F = 22\n   \\]\n\nLet's Check the Validity:\n\nNow that I think about it, if \\( F = 22 \\), then:\n- From \\( G = F - 2 \\), we find \\( G = 20 \\).\n- Using the first equation \\( S + F = 32 \\), where \\( F = 22 \\), it follows:\n  \\[\n  S + 22 = 32 \\implies S = 10\n  \\]\n\nReflecting on the Answer:\n\nThis seems consistent across all my equations! Sombrero costs \\$10, flip-flops cost \\$22, and the sunglasses cost \\$20. Everything adds up correctly with these values. I felt a bit of hesitation with the system of equations at first, but once I realized substitution was cleaner, there was a moment of clarity. This process was quite satisfying!\n\nAnd there we have it: the sombrero costs \\(\\boxed{10}\\) dollars.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $\\$ x, \\$ y$ and $\\$ z$ be the prices of a sombrero, a pair of flip-flops and sunglasses, respectively. We can then rewrite the problem as a system of equations: \\begin{align*}\nx+y &= 32\\\\\ny+z &= 42\\\\\nx+z &= 30\n\\end{align*} Adding these gives: \\begin{align*}\n2x+2y+2z &= 32+42+30 = 104\\\\\nx+y+z &= 52\n\\end{align*} So $x = (x+y+z)-(y+z) = 52-42=10$. So the sombrero costs $\\boxed{\\$ 10}$."
