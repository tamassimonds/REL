  "problem": "Matt and Ryan are playing an exciting round of Rock Paper Scissors: The Collectible Card Game. Matt is convinced that Rock can beat anything, so his deck consists only of 8 Rock cards.   Ryan's deck consists of 5 Paper cards and 3 Scissors cards.  In the game, Matt randomly selects 3 cards from his deck and places them on the table.  Ryan then randomly selects 3 cards and places one on each of Matt's cards.  If Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock, then what's the probability that Ryan beats Matt in a landslide by choosing 3 Paper cards in a row?",

    "working_out": "First Impressions and Initial Thoughts:\n- Alright, so this problem involves probability with cards, which is inherently random. At first glance, it reminds me of problems involving combinations, like drawing balls from a bag, but with the added dimension of decision factors (Ryan's choice to counter Matt's \"all Rock\" strategy).\n- The \"landslide\" win condition is interesting and means that Ryan has to win all 3 rounds with Paper cards against Matt's Rocks. \n\nExploration and Brainstorming:\n- Matt's cards are straightforward: 8 Rock cards. When he draws 3, he's always going to have 3 Rocks, which simplifies the problem slightly since there\u2019s no need to compute different combinations or probabilities for Matt.\n- Ryan's deck, on the other hand, consists of 5 Paper cards and 3 Scissors cards. \n- To win in a landslide, Ryan needs all 3 of his chosen cards to be Paper, which directly counters all of Matt's Rocks.\n  \nThinking About Ryan\u2019s Choices:\n- I'll start by figuring out how many ways Ryan can choose 3 cards from his deck of 8 (5 Papers + 3 Scissors). This can be calculated using combinations: \\( C(8, 3) \\).\n- Next, I'll determine how many of those combinations involve only Paper cards, which means choosing all 3 cards from the 5 Paper cards available: \\( C(5, 3) \\).\n\nCalculating the Combinations:\n- Total ways to draw 3 cards from 8: \\( C(8, 3) \\). Let's compute that:\n  \\[\n  C(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\n  \\]\n- Total ways to draw 3 Paper cards from the 5 Paper cards: \\( C(5, 3) \\):\n  \\[\n  C(5, 3) = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n  \\]\n\nReflecting on the Steps:\n- So far, the calculations seem reasonable. Ryan has a total of 56 possible ways to choose his 3 cards, and only 10 of these outcomes involve a landslide win with 3 Paper cards.\n\nThe Final Probability:\n- Probability that Ryan draws 3 Paper cards in a row: \n  \\[\n  \\frac{10}{56} = \\frac{5}{28}\n  \\]\n\n- The calculations make sense because I\u2019ve accounted for all possible draws and the particular win condition. The probability is indeed feasible given the constraints of card distribution.\n\nChecking for Mistakes:\n- This probability feels right considering Ryan\u2019s relatively high proportion of Paper cards, but let's double-check: I\u2019m satisfied with using selection formulae to determine the total outcomes and wins given how we can model Ryan\u2019s draw as a combination problem.\n\nConclusion:\n- After laying out the problem, considering the steps, and verifying calculations, I\u2019m confident that the probability that Ryan beats Matt in a landslide is \\(\\frac{5}{28}\\). This approach reflects both the mechanics of the game and the statistical likelihood required by the problem structure.",

  "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ equally likely ways for Ryan to pick 3 of his 8 cards to play. There are are $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways for those 3 cards to be 3 of his 5 paper cards. So, the probability that he picks 3 paper cards  is $\\frac{\\text{successful outcomes}}{\\text{total equally-likely outcomes}} = \\frac{10}{56}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{28}}$."
