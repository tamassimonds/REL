    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together, and I'll walk through my thought process as naturally as possible.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nThe question is asking for the sum of all integers from \\(-30\\) to \\(26\\). \n\nFirst thoughts: This is a classic problem involving the sum of an arithmetic sequence. I've done something like this before. I know that instead of adding each number individually (which is tedious), there must be a formula or method that can simplify this process. \n\n### Step 2: Explore Different Approaches \n\n- **Direct Addition Strategy**: I could add each integer manually, starting from \\(-30\\) and moving up to \\(26\\), but that seems inefficient.\n  \n- **Summing Using Pairing Strategy**: I remember I can pair numbers in such a way that their sums simplify the problem, such as \\((-30+26), (-29+25),\\ldots\\).\n\n- **Formulaic Approach**: I also recall there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is \\( S = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (a + l) \\), where \\(n\\) is the number of terms, \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(l\\) is the last term.\n\nWait! Let's think further.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Formula Approach \n\nGiven:\n- First term \\(a = -30\\)\n- Last term \\(l = 26\\)\n\nI need to find the number of terms \\((n)\\) first.\n\nThe sequence from \\(-30\\) to \\(26\\) is a sequence of consecutive integers, so the number of terms \\(n\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ n = (26 - (-30)) + 1 = 26 + 30 + 1 = 57 \\]\n\nI initially thought about it being \\(26 - (-30)\\), which is \\(56\\), but realized adding that \"1\" for inclusion is important. \n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Sum Using the Formula\n\nNow substitute these values into the sum formula:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (a + l) \\]  \n\\[ S = \\frac{57}{2} \\cdot (-30 + 26) \\]\n\nCalculate what's inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ -30 + 26 = -4 \\]\n\nNow plug back:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{57}{2} \\cdot (-4) \\]  \n\\[ S = 57 \\cdot (-2) \\]  \n\\[ S = -114 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Quick Reflection\n\nOkay, having calculated that, let's quickly reflect: \n\n- Does the formula make sense? Yes, I applied it correctly with the correct values.\n- Is the process sound? Yes, I accounted for the inclusion of both bounds.\n- Does the negative sum make sense? Double-checking a few pairs like \\((-30+26), (-29+25)\\), seems reasonable that it's negative since negative numbers outweigh positive ones in that range.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sum of all integers from \\(-30\\) to \\(26\\) is indeed \\(-114\\). That makes sense given the range starts more negative than it ends positive, resulting in a negative sum. \n\nGreat! This method feels solid, and the logic checks out. I'd confidently say that's the correct answer.",

  "ground_truth": "The sum of all integers $y$ for which $-26\\le y\\le26$ is 0 since for every negative term there is a positive term of the same absolute value. Thus, the sum of all integers $x$ for which $-30\\le x\\le26$ is $-30-29-28-27=-30\\times4+1+2+3=-120+6=\\boxed{-114}$."
