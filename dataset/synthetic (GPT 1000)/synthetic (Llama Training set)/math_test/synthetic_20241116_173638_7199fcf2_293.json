    "working_out": "First impressions and brainstorming:\n\n- Okay, let's start by trying to understand the expression \\(\\sqrt{63-\\sqrt{x}}\\). This needs to be an integer, so we're dealing with something potentially involving perfect squares.\n- My gut says this problem is related to simplifying nested square roots and understanding when they produce integer results. \n- The immediate task is to link \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) to something that makes this expression an integer. I might not see the full path right away, but let\u2019s start exploring.\n\nStep 1: Conceptualizing \\(\\sqrt{63-\\sqrt{x}} = k\\) (where \\(k\\) is an integer):\n\n- Let's set up the equation where we have \\(\\sqrt{63-\\sqrt{x}}\\) as an integer. Let\u2019s call this integer \\(k\\). So, \\(\\sqrt{63-\\sqrt{x}} = k\\).\n- If \\(\\sqrt{63-\\sqrt{x}} = k\\), squaring both sides gives \\(63 - \\sqrt{x} = k^2\\).\n- That simplifies to \\(\\sqrt{x} = 63 - k^2\\).\n\nStep 2: Natural restrictions and constraints:\n\n- For \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) to be a real number, \\(x\\) must be non-negative. Also, \\(63 - k^2\\) needs to be non-negative because \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) is a non-negative real number.\n- Also, since \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) needs to yield a real number, \\(x\\) itself must be the square of some non-negative real number, \\((63 - k^2)^2\\).\n- So the inequality \\(63 \\geq k^2\\) gives a range of \\(k\\).\n\nStep 3: Calculating the possible values for \\(k\\):\n\n- \\(k^2\\) can range from 0 up to 63 (since \\(63 \\geq k^2\\)).\n- The integer values of \\(k\\) could be \\(k=0, 1, 2, \\ldots, \\lfloor \\sqrt{63} \\rfloor\\).\n- Calculating \\(\\lfloor \\sqrt{63} \\rfloor\\), we find that \\(\\sqrt{63} \\approx 7.94\\), so \\(\\lfloor \\sqrt{63} \\rfloor = 7\\).\n\nStep 4: Checking all \\(k\\) values from 0 to 7:\n\n- Let\u2019s plug in each integer \\(k\\) into \\(63 - k^2\\) to check if it maintains valid constraints for \\(x\\).\n- Calculate for each \\(k\\), the expression \\(\\sqrt{x} = 63 - k^2\\):\n  - \\(k = 0\\), gives \\(\\sqrt{x} = 63\\).\n  - \\(k = 1\\), gives \\(\\sqrt{x} = 62\\).\n  - \\(k = 2\\), gives \\(\\sqrt{x} = 59\\).\n  - \\(k = 3\\), gives \\(\\sqrt{x} = 54\\).\n  - \\(k = 4\\), gives \\(\\sqrt{x} = 47\\).\n  - \\(k = 5\\), gives \\(\\sqrt{x} = 38\\).\n  - \\(k = 6\\), gives \\(\\sqrt{x} = 27\\).\n  - \\(k = 7\\), gives \\(\\sqrt{x} = 14\\).\n\nStep 5: Determining real values of \\(x\\):\n\n- For each of these valid \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) values, \\(x\\) itself is the square of these values:\n  - At \\(k = 0, x = 63^2\\)\n  - At \\(k = 1, x = 62^2\\)\n  - At \\(k = 2, x = 59^2\\)\n  - At \\(k = 3, x = 54^2\\)\n  - At \\(k = 4, x = 47^2\\)\n  - At \\(k = 5, x = 38^2\\)\n  - At \\(k = 6, x = 27^2\\)\n  - At \\(k = 7, x = 14^2\\)\n\nConclusion:\n\n- Because every integer \\(k\\) from 0 to 7 gives us a corresponding real \\(x = (63 - k^2)^2\\), there are 8 real values of \\(x\\) that satisfy the given condition.\n\nThere are indeed 8 real values of \\(x\\) that make \\(\\sqrt{63-\\sqrt{x}}\\) an integer.",

  "ground_truth": "Suppose that  $k = \\sqrt{63 - \\sqrt{x}}$ is an integer. Then $0\\le k \\le \\sqrt{63}$. 7 is the largest integer less than $\\sqrt{63}$, and since $k$ is an integer, we have $0\\le k \\le 7$. Thus there are 8 possible integer values of $k$. For each such $k$, the corresponding value of $x$ is $\\left(63 - k^2\\right)^2$. Because  $\\left(63 -\nk^2\\right)^2$ is positive and decreasing for $0\\le k \\le 7$, the $\\boxed{8}$ values of $x$ are distinct."
