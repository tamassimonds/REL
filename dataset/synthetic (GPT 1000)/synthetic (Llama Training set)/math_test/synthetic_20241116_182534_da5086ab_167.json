    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and take it step by step, thinking out loud as I go:\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have the inequality \\( (100,000,000 \\div x^4) < 1 \\). Our task is to find the smallest positive integer \\( x \\) that satisfies this inequality.\n\n#### Initial Thoughts\n\n- At a high level, this inequality implies that \\( x^4 \\) must be greater than 100,000,000 because when dividing 100,000,000 by \\( x^4 \\), the result must be less than 1.\n- This resembles a problem where I need to isolate \\( x \\) by applying a fourth root, but let's think this through before jumping into calculations.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n1. **Algebraic Manipulation:**\n   - If \\( \\frac{100,000,000}{x^4} < 1 \\), then \\( x^4 > 100,000,000 \\).\n   - To solve for \\( x \\), it'll be useful to consider taking the fourth root. I'm already thinking about raising both sides to the power of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n2. **Estimation:**\n   - Before precise calculations, estimating might illuminate the scale of numbers I'm dealing with. \n   - I know \\( 10^8 = 100,000,000 \\) is a large number, so \\( x \\) must also be fairly large.\n\n3. **Brute Force (Trial and Error):**\n   - A quick brute force approach might also work: testing simple powers of numbers close to a fourth root until the inequality is satisfied.\n\n### Step-by-step Approach\n\n#### Algebraic Solution\n\n1. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - From \\( x^4 > 100,000,000 \\), rewrite it as \\( x > 100,000,000^{1/4} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Fourth Root:**\n   - To find \\( 100,000,000^{1/4} \\), express 100,000,000 in terms of powers of 10:\n   \\[\n   100,000,000 = 10^8\n   \\]\n   - Thus, \\( 100,000,000^{1/4} = (10^8)^{1/4} = 10^{8/4} = 10^2 = 100 \\).\n\n3. **Conclude the Integer Solution:**\n   - Since \\( x \\) must be greater than 100 (not equal since we want \\( x^4 \\) strictly greater than 100,000,000), the smallest integer \\( x \\) is \\( 101 \\).\n\n#### Verification\n\n- **Check if 101 satisfies the inequality:**\n  - Calculate \\( 101^4 \\) to ensure it's greater than 100,000,000:\n  \\[\n  101^4 = 101 \\times 101 \\times 101 \\times 101\n  \\]\n  - I can estimate: \\( 101^2 \\approx 10201 \\). Then \\( 10201 \\times 101 = 1030301 \\).\n  - Multiply again by 101. This will definitely exceed 100,000,000 as \\( 101^4 \\approx 103,030,301 \\).\n\n- **Check for smaller potential solutions:**\n  - Calculate \\( 100^4 = (10^2)^4 = 10^8 = 100,000,000 \\), which shows that \\( x = 100 \\) gives exactly 1 when dividing, not less.\n\n### Final Reflection\n\nAfter this exploration and checking, I'm confident that \\( x = 101 \\) is indeed the smallest positive integer for which \\( (100,000,000 \\div x^4) < 1 \\). It fits the requirement because \\( 101 > 100 \\) and verifies the inequality when plugged back in.\n\nGreat! That wraps up the solution\u2014our smallest positive integer \\( x \\) is \\(\\boxed{101}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The fraction's numerator is equal to $10^8$, or $100^4$.  Taking the fourth root of both sides, we find that $\\frac{100}{x} < 1$, meaning that $100<x$ (since $x$ is positive).  So $x = \\boxed{101}$ is the smallest positive integer solution."
