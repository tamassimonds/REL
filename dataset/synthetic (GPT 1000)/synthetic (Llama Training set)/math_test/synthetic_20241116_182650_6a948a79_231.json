    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this step-by-step process for simplifying the expression \\(1^2 - 2^2 + 3^2 - 4^2 + \\dots + (2n - 1)^2 - (2n)^2\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nFirst, it's important to identify the pattern in the expression. The sequence consists of squares of alternating odd and even numbers being subtracted. Specifically:\n\n- The sequence begins with \\(1^2\\).\n- Next is \\( -2^2\\).\n- Then \\( +3^2\\).\n- Followed by \\(-4^2\\).\n\nAnd this pattern continues until we reach \\((2n - 1)^2 - (2n)^2\\).\n\nThe form \\(a^2 - b^2\\) is recognizable as a difference of squares, which can be simplified to \\((a - b)(a + b)\\). This realization could be key to simplifying the entire expression.\n\n### Step 2: Explore a Potential Strategy\n\nNow, should I try applying the difference of squares formula here? Let's check if this might be useful:\n\n\\[ (2k-1)^2 - (2k)^2 = ((2k-1) - 2k)((2k-1) + 2k) \\]\n\nCarrying out the algebra:\n\n\\[ = (-1)(4k - 1) = -(4k - 1) \\]\n\nThis simplifies each pair in the sequence. Great, let's write down this general term transformation:\n\n\\[ (2k-1)^2 - (2k)^2 = -(4k - 1) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Build the Simplified Expression\n\nNow, the entire expression becomes a sum of these newly derived simplified terms:\n\n\\[ -(4 \\times 1 - 1) - (4 \\times 2 - 1) - \\cdots - (4n - 1) \\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[ -(4 \\cdot 1 - 1) - (4 \\cdot 2 - 1) - \\cdots - (4n - 1) \\]\n\n### Step 4: Sum the Series\n\nNotice each term is \\(-(4k - 1)\\), which, when summed over \\(k = 1\\) to \\(n\\), gives:\n\n\\[ -\\sum_{k=1}^n (4k - 1) = -\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n 4k - \\sum_{k=1}^n 1\\right) \\]\n\nUpon reflection, let\u2019s break that down:\n\n1. **Sum of \\(4k\\) from 1 to n:**\n   \\[ \\sum_{k=1}^n 4k = 4(1 + 2 + \\cdots + n) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 2n(n+1) \\]\n\n2. **Sum of constant 1 from 1 to n:**\n   \\[ \\sum_{k=1}^n 1 = n \\]\n\nPutting it back together:\n\\[ - (2n(n+1) - n) = -(2n^2 + 2n - n) = -(2n^2 + n) \\]\n\n### Step 5: Verify and Reflect\n\nSimplified to: \n\\[ -(2n^2 + n) = -2n^2 - n \\]\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because it logically follows from each step leveraging algebraic identities and confirms the individual term calculations.\n\n### Aha Moment\n\nThe simplification was consistent and results in a single concise formula. It\u2019s interesting to see how the alternating squares transformed into a predictable polynomial expression.\n\nFinally, the solution to the problem is:\n\\[ -2n^2 - n \\]\n\nThe detailed thinking, checks, breaking down of series, and strategic use of algebra provided a clear pathway through this problem.",
