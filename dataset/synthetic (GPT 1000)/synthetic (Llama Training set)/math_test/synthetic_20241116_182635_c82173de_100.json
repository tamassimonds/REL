    "working_out": "### Initial Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see this problem, it reminds me of the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius. Our given equation is close to this form but not quite. I need to manipulate it to see if it can match the standard form. \n\nAnother thing that comes to mind is the concept of completing the square, which is often used to rewrite equations in a form that's easier to interpret in terms of geometry (like circles).\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nThe task is to find the value of \\(c\\) such that the radius of the circle is \\(1\\). I need to reflect on how the terms in the equation relate to the properties of a circle and how \\(c\\) specifically affects the radius.\n\n### Brainstorming Possible Strategies\n\n1. Complete the square for the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms to transform the equation into the standard form of a circle.\n2. After rewriting the equation in standard form, identify the radius and equate it to 1 to solve for \\(c\\).\n\n### Attempt at Completing the Square\n\nLet's start with completing the square:\n\n**Step 1**: Group and rearrange the terms related to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\\[ \nx^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Step 2**: Complete the square for \\(x\\):\n- The \\(x\\) terms: \\(x^2 - 10x\\)\n- Take half of \\(-10\\) (which is \\(-5\\)), square it (25), and adjust the equation:\n  \\[ \n  (x^2 - 10x + 25) - 25 \n  \\]\n- This becomes \\((x - 5)^2 - 25\\).\n\n**Step 3**: Complete the square for \\(y\\):\n- The \\(y\\) terms: \\(y^2 + 6y\\)\n- Take half of \\(6\\) (which is \\(3\\)), square it (9), and adjust the equation:\n  \\[ \n  (y^2 + 6y + 9) - 9 \n  \\]\n- This becomes \\((y + 3)^2 - 9\\).\n\nNow the equation, combining all these, becomes:\n\\[ \n(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \n\\]\n\nRewriting:\n\\[ \n(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \n\\]\n\n### Reflecting on the Transformed Equation\n\nThe transformed equation \\((x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\\) is now in the standard form. The term on the right, \\(34 - c\\), represents the square of the radius, \\(r^2\\). \n\n### Setting the Condition for the Radius\n\nTo ensure the radius is \\(1\\), we set:\n\\[ \nr^2 = 1 \n\\]\nThus:\n\\[ \n34 - c = 1 \n\\]\n\n### Solving for \\(c\\)\n\nLet's solve the equation:\n\\[ \n34 - c = 1\n\\]\nSubtract 1 from 34:\n\\[ \n34 - 1 = c \n\\]\nThus:\n\\[ \nc = 33 \n\\]\n\n### Verification\n\n- The center of the circle is \\((5, -3)\\), and the radius we derived using \\(r^2 = 1\\) checks out as having radius of 1.\n- This was calculated correctly based on the transformation and analysis steps.\n- Rechecking calculations aligns with expectations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe value of \\(c\\) for which the radius of the circle is \\(1\\) is \\(\\boxed{33}\\). Reflectively, the approach of completing the square and relating it to the standard form of a circle worked smoothly here.",

  "ground_truth": "Completing the square gives us $(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c$. Since we want the radius to be 1, we must have $34 - c = 1^2$. It follows that $c = \\boxed{33}$."
