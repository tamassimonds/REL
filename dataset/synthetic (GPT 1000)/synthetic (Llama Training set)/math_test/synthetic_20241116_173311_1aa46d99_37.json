    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. The aim here is to determine the remainder when the base-16 number \\( 729_{16} \\) is divided by the base-10 number 15. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nAt first glance, this problem requires converting a base-16 (hexadecimal) number to base-10 (decimal) to make the division by the base-10 number 15 straightforward. \n\n### Brainstorming\n\nThe core strategy is:\n1. Convert the base-16 number to base-10.\n2. Perform the division operation to find both the quotient and the remainder.\n\nLet's break this down.\n\n### Step 2: Convert \\( 729_{16} \\) to Base-10\n\nThe number \\( 729_{16} \\) is a hexadecimal number. To convert it to decimal:\n- The hexadecimal system is base-16, which means it uses the digits 0 to 9 and the letters A to F (with A representing 10, B 11, ..., F 15).\n  \nHere, \\( 729_{16} \\) contains the digits:\n- \\( 7 \\times 16^2 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\times 16^1 \\)\n- \\( 9 \\times 16^0 \\)\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\\[ \n729_{16} = 7 \\times 16^2 + 2 \\times 16^1 + 9 \\times 16^0 \n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( 16^0 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 16^1 = 16 \\)\n- \\( 16^2 = 256 \\)\n\nCalculate each component:\n1. \\( 7 \\times 256 = 1792 \\)\n2. \\( 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\)\n3. \\( 9 \\times 1 = 9 \\)\n\nNow, sum these results:\n\\[ \n1792 + 32 + 9 = 1833 \n\\]\n\nSo, \\( 729_{16} = 1833_{10} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Divide the Base-10 Number by 15\n\nNow, we need to divide \\( 1833_{10} \\) by 15 and find the remainder.\n\n\\[ \n1833 \\div 15 \n\\]\n\nUsing division (you might also use a calculator, but let's check manually):\n\n1. \\( 1833 \\div 15 = 122 \\), since \\( 15 \\times 122 = 1830 \\)\n2. Subtracting gives \\( 1833 - 1830 = 3 \\)\n\nTherefore, when 1833 is divided by 15, the quotient is 122 and the remainder is 3.\n\n### Step 4: Reflect and Verify\n\n- **Conversion Verification**: Double-check the conversion calculation from hexadecimal to decimal. Check that the multiplication and addition were accurate. They indeed were.\n- **Division Verification**: Confirm the manual division and subtraction steps are correct. All checks seem accurate.\n\nThus, the remainder when \\( 729_{16} \\) is divided by 15 is \\( \\boxed{3} \\). \n\nReflecting on the strategy, the conversion approach was necessary and straightforward, aiding a clear path to calculating the remainder with basic arithmetic operations. Everything checks out!",

  "ground_truth": "We have $$729_{16} = 7\\cdot 16^2 + 2\\cdot 16 + 9.$$ We could actually convert this to base 10 and divide by $15$, but we can also use a clever trick here, writing $16$ as $15+1$ and $16^2$ as $15\\cdot 17+1$. Then \\begin{align*}\n729_{16} &= 7(15\\cdot 17+1) + 2(15+1) + 9 \\\\\n&= 15(7\\cdot 17+2) + (7+2+9) \\\\\n&= (\\text{a multiple of 15}) + 18,\n\\end{align*} so when we divide by $15$, the remainder is the same as the remainder left by $18$. This is $\\boxed{3}$.\n\n(This trick may remind you of the justification for the test of divisibility by $9$ in base $10$. That isn't a coincidence!)"
