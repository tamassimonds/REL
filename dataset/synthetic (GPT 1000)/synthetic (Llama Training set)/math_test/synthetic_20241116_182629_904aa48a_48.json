    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem and tackle it step by step. At first glance, this seems like a typical combination problem involving different denominations of bills. Our goal is to find how many ways we can use $\\$5$ bills and $\\$2$ bills to make a total of $\\$17$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nInitially, I'm thinking about the problem like this: we need to balance the total of $\\$17$ using only two types of bills. The first thought that comes to mind is: \"If I try using different numbers of $\\$5$ bills, will I be able to fill in the rest with $\\$2$ bills?\" \n\n### Step 2: Strategy Brainstorming\nThere are a few ways to approach this problem:\n1. **Trial and Error:** Start with different numbers of $\\$5$ bills and see if the remaining amount can be made up with $\\$2$ bills.\n2. **Algebraic Approach:** Create an algebraic equation representing the scenario.\n3. **Systematic Listing:** Systematically list all possible combinations.\n\nI'm leaning towards the trial and error method because it seems straightforward given the specific numbers and because it's small enough to manage. Let's also reflect if another approach might simplify it after trying the first few steps. \n\n### Step 3: Testing with Trial and Error\nLet's start with the maximum possible number of $\\$5$ bills and work downward:\n\n1. **Using 3 $\\$5$ bills:**\n   - 3 $\\$5$ bills = 3 \u00d7 5 = \\$15\n   - Want to check if the remainder, \\$17 - \\$15 = \\$2, can be made using $\\$2$ bills.\n   - Yes, it can. So, one combination is (3 $\\$5$ bills, 1 $\\$2$ bill).\n\n2. **Using 2 $\\$5$ bills:**\n   - 2 $\\$5$ bills = 2 \u00d7 5 = \\$10\n   - Remainder = \\$17 - \\$10 = \\$7\n   - Check if \\$7 can be made with $\\$2$ bills:\n     - 7 doesn't evenly divide by 2, because 7 \u00f7 2 = 3 remainder 1. So, this doesn't work.\n\n3. **Using 1 $\\$5$ bill:**\n   - 1 $\\$5$ bill = 1 \u00d7 5 = \\$5\n   - Remainder = \\$17 - \\$5 = \\$12\n   - Check if \\$12 can be made with $\\$2$ bills:\n     - 12 \u00f7 2 = 6, which works. So, the combination is (1 $\\$5$ bill, 6 $\\$2$ bills).\n\n4. **Using 0 $\\$5$ bills:**\n   - No $\\$5$ bills, the remainder is the full amount: \\$17\n   - Check if \\$17 can be made with $\\$2$ bills:\n     - 17 \u00f7 2 = 8 remainder 1. It doesn\u2019t work entirely because of the remainder.\n\n### Step 4: List the Combinations\nFrom the above trials, the valid combinations I found are:\n- (3 $\\$5$ bills, 1 $\\$2$ bill)\n- (1 $\\$5$ bill, 6 $\\$2$ bills)\n\n### Step 5: Reflection and Verification\nReflecting on the steps, I see I systematically attempted all reasonable combinations using trial methods for each feasible number of $\\$5$ bills, checking remainder feasibility with $\\$2$ bills. The calculations seem correct, and there don't appear to be any missed combinations since adding any more $\\$5$ bills or using any more $\\$2$ bills exceed or don\u2019t fit the requirements.\n\n### Conclusion\nThere are **2 different combinations** of $\\$5$ bills and $\\$2$ bills that add up to $\\$17$. This counts all possible options with the constraints given. \n\nThis trial and error approach worked well here given the relatively small numbers involved, and it was a rewarding method as we could easily check each scenario.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the total $\\$17$ is odd, there must be an odd number of $\\$5$ bills.  One $\\$5$ bill plus six $\\$2$ bills is a solution, as is three $\\$5$ bills plus one $\\$2$ bill.  Five $\\$5$ bills exceeds $\\$17$, so these are the only $\\boxed{2}$ combinations that work."
