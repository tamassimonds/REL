    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together. From the very beginning, it seems like we've got a rational equation here: \\(\\frac{3x+2}{x-1} = 4\\). My first instinct with an equation like this is to eliminate the fraction. Generally, fractions can be tricky, so getting rid of them often simplifies things. Let's keep that in mind as we move forward. \n\n**Step 1: Understand the equation.**\n\nOkay, so we need to solve for \\(x\\). We've got a fraction \\(\\frac{3x+2}{x-1}\\), and this is set equal to 4. Fractions equal to a whole number often suggest that cross-multiplying is a potential strategy. \n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm strategies.**\n\n1. **Cross-Multiplication:** This seems like the most straightforward approach. If we multiply both sides by \\(x - 1\\), that should rid us of the fraction. This approach feels solid because it directly deals with the fraction head-on.\n   \n2. **Substitution or Guessing:** These methods don't seem efficient here since we have a variable in the denominator.\n\n3. **Graphical/ Numerical Methods:** While these are valid, they are unnecessary here because algebraically solving it seems more direct.\n\nLet's go with cross-multiplication and simplify from there.\n\n**Step 3: Execute the cross-multiplication strategy.**\n\nDoing this, we get:\n\n\\[ 3x + 2 = 4(x - 1) \\]\n\nNow simplify the equation on the right:\n\n\\[ 3x + 2 = 4x - 4 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\(x\\).**\n\nAt this step, let's get all the terms involving \\(x\\) on one side and constants on the other. I feel a bit more organized doing this if I subtract \\(3x\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2 = 4x - 3x - 4 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 2 = x - 4 \\]\n\nNow, add 4 to both sides to solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ 2 + 4 = x \\]\n\n\\[ x = 6 \\]\n\n**Step 5: Verify the solution.**\n\nBefore declaring victory, let's plug \\(x = 6\\) back into the original equation to ensure it works:\n\n\\[\\frac{3(6) + 2}{6 - 1} = 4\\]\n\nCalculate:\n\n\\[ \\frac{18 + 2}{5} = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{20}{5} = 4 \\]\n\nYep, both sides equal 4, so \\(x = 6\\) is indeed the correct solution!\n\n**Step 6: Reflect on the process.**\n\nThat went pretty smoothly with the cross-multiplication strategy. No hiccups or wrong turns really, which is always nice. This approach was efficient because we effectively eliminated the fraction early on.\n\nIn summary, we used cross-multiplication to solve for \\(x = 6\\), and verification of the solution confirmed our answer was correct.
