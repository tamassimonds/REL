    "working_out": "Sure, let's think through this problem step by step. It's important to understand that this kind of problem requires us to evaluate a series of equivalences or equations. Each step needs a careful check to determine if the expressions are indeed equivalent. Let's start with the brainstorming phase.\n\n1. **First Impressions and Brainstorming:**\n\n   - This problem involves checking the equivalency of expressions, which seems straightforward at first glance.\n   - However, I need to be careful about algebraic manipulations and mathematical properties to make sure each equivalence or inequality is correctly understood.\n   - This kind of problem often requires a good understanding of basic algebra rules, like distributive properties, fraction simplifications, and the properties of equations.\n\n2. **Evaluating Each Question:**\n\n   - **Question 1: Is \\(\\frac{2}{3x}\\) equivalent to \\(\\frac{2x}{3}\\)?**\n     - My immediate reaction is no, because \\(\\frac{2}{3x}\\) means dividing 2 by \\(3x\\), while \\(\\frac{2x}{3}\\) means \\(2x\\) divided by 3. \n     - The presence of \\(x\\) in the denominator in the first expression and the numerator in the second changes their values unless \\(x = 1\\), which isn't stated.\n     - Let's solidify this thought: with a variable in a different position, these expressions aren't equivalent. So, the answer is no.\n\n   - **Question 2: Is \\(\\frac{1-h}{2h}\\) equivalent to \\(\\frac{h-1}{2h}\\)?**\n     - When I look at this problem, it seems to be about how subtraction affects order. \n     - \\(\\frac{1-h}{2h}\\) is not equivalent to \\(\\frac{h-1}{2h}\\) because they differ by sign.\n     - Actually, let me think it through: the numerator order changes the sign due to the negative sign, thus these aren't equivalent. The answer here is no.\n\n   - **Question 3: Is \\(-(u+u^2)\\) equivalent to \\(-u-u^2\\)?**\n     - My initial thought is yes, because distributing the negative sign across the parentheses in both expressions yields identical terms. \n     - Let me quickly check: \n       \\(-(u + u^2) = -u - u^2\\).\n     - This confirms they are equivalent, so the answer is yes.\n\n   - **Question 4: Is \\(-(3+y)\\) equivalent to \\(-3+y\\)?**\n     - This looks similar to question 3, but let me see the signs carefully.\n     - \\(-(3+y)\\) results in \\(-3-y\\) upon distribution, which is not the same as \\(-3 + y\\).\n     - Hence, these differ, making the answer no.\n\n   - **Question 5: Is \\(\\frac{j}{2}\\) equivalent to \\(\\frac{1}{2}j\\)?**\n     - These expressions look very similar. \n     - Dividing \\(j\\) by 2 involves multiplying \\(j\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n     - They are actually just different representations of the same division, which suggests equivalence. The answer is yes.\n\n   - **Question 6: Is \\(x+y+z\\) equivalent to \\(y+x+z\\)?**\n     - Immediately, I think the commutative property of addition allows us to rearrange terms without affecting equality.\n     - Let me reflect: switching \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) places does not change the value of the expression. Therefore, this does hold true. The answer is yes.\n\n3. **Calculating and Reflecting:**\n\n   - Now, let's calculate the total sum of numbers for questions where we answered 'yes':\n     - Questions 3, 5, and 6 were 'yes', so we add the numbers 3, 5, and 6.\n     - \\[3 + 5 + 6 = 14\\]\n\n4. **Final Review:**\n\n   - I\u2019ve double-checked my logic and calculations. Each review along the way confirmed or corrected my initial thoughts on each question.\n   - Overall, yes, I am confident with the solution provided. If you feel uncertain at any step, it\u2019s always a good practice to reevaluate the underlying math principles involved or test specific examples.\n\nThe total sum of numbers corresponding to the 'yes' answers is 14.",

  "ground_truth": "Recall that two expressions are equivalent if they are equal for all valid choices of the variable or variables involved.\n\nQuestion 1:  no, because the given expressions are equal only for certain values of $x$. Almost any $x$ will do: take $x=2$ and note that $\\frac{2}{3(2)}=\\frac{1}{3}$ while $\\frac{2(2)}{3}=\\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nQuestion 2: no, because the second expression is $-1$ times the first expression. Thus they are only equal if each of them happens to equal 0. For example, if $h=3$, then $\\frac{1-h}{2h}=\\frac{1-3}{2(3)}=\\frac{-2}{6}=-\\frac{1}{3}$, while $\\frac{h-1}{2h} = \\frac{3-1}{2(3)} = \\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nQuestion 3: yes, because we obtain the second expression by distributing the negative sign across the parentheses in the first expression.\n\nQuestion 4: no, because the negative sign has not been properly distributed. To confirm that the expressions are not equivalent, we can choose a value like $y=3$ to find that the first expression becomes $-(3+3)=-6$ while the second expression is $-3+3=0$.\n\nQuestion 5: yes, because we can multiply $\\frac{1}{2}$ by $j$ in the usual way by writing $j$ as $\\frac{j}{1}$. We get \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}j = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{j}{1} = \\frac{1\\cdot j}{2\\cdot 1} = \\frac{j}{2}.\n\\]\n\nQuestion 6: yes, by the commutative property of addition.\n\nThe questions whose answers are yes are 3, 5, and 6. The sum of these numbers is $\\boxed{14}$."
