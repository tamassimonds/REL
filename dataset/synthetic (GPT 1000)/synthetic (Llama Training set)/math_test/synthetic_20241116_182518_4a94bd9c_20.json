    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. \n\n### First Thoughts:\n- The expression is \\(\\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{3} + 7\\sqrt{27}}\\). When I first see this, I recognize that the denominator has multiple square roots, which suggests that rationalizing the denominator is needed.\n- Rationalizing usually involves multiplying by a conjugate or simplifying the square roots first. I remember that similar problems have been solved using these two approaches.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies:\n1. **Simplify the square roots first**: The square roots can often be simplified. For example, \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) is the same as \\(\\sqrt{9 \\times 3}\\), which simplifies to \\(3\\sqrt{3}\\).\n2. **Rationalizing the denominator**: If simplification doesn't entirely remove the square roots, multiplying by the conjugate might help.\n   \nLet's attempt these strategies one by one:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Square Roots\n- The denominator is \\(3\\sqrt{3} + 7\\sqrt{27}\\).\n- \\(\\sqrt{27} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 3} = 3\\sqrt{3}\\).\n- Therefore, \\(7\\sqrt{27} = 7 \\times 3\\sqrt{3} = 21\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nNow, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{3} + 21\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n- Combine the like terms in the denominator: \\(3\\sqrt{3} + 21\\sqrt{3} = 24\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nSo the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{24\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nPaused here for a quick check:\n- I simplified both terms in the denominator correctly and combined them, so this seems right so far. \n\n### Step 2: Rationalizing the Denominator\n- The current expression is \\(\\frac{8}{24\\sqrt{3}}\\).\n- To rationalize the denominator, I need to get rid of the \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), so multiply the numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nThis results in:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}}{24\\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n- Simplify the new denominator: \\(24\\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 24 \\times 3 = 72\\).\n\nThe expression is now:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{72}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Fraction\n- Both 8 and 72 can be reduced: \\( \\frac{8}{72} = \\frac{1}{9} \\) (since both can be divided by their greatest common divisor, 8).\n\nSo, the final expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{9}\n\\]\n\n### Reflection:\n- I verified that I simplified the square roots correctly and used the correct method to rationalize the denominator.\n- Checked the arithmetic throughout; it looks consistent.\n- I started with potential strategies, checked my simplifications, and arrived at a correctly rationalized expression.\n\nThis problem's lesson is that often simplifying first can reveal an easier pathway than trying more complex operations initially.\n\nThe final simplified and rationalized expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{9}\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "We begin by recognizing that since $27 = 3^3$, $7\\sqrt{27}$ simplifies to $7\\cdot3\\sqrt{3}=21\\sqrt{3}$.
