    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. \n\n---\n\n### First Thoughts\n\nThe problem mentions a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree 2011 with certain given values: \n- \\( P(1) = 0 \\)\n- \\( P(2) = 1 \\)\n- \\( P(4) = 2 \\)\n- ...\n- \\( P(2^{2011}) = 2011 \\)\n\nThis setup reminds me of the concept of Lagrange interpolation or perhaps some kind of systematic construction of the polynomial. My initial impression is that this looks like it might involve either interpolation or constructing a polynomial using roots and values. Let's explore this...\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n1. **Recognize the form of \\( P(x) \\):** \n   It looks like \\( P(x) \\) has roots at specific powers of 2. Is it possible there's a connection to the binary representation of values somehow? Hmm, something's striking: \\( P(x) = 0 \\) at \\( x = 1 \\). \n\n2. **Construct a systematic polynomial:**\n   It's a degree-2011 polynomial. Since \\( P(1) = 0 \\), we might have something like:\n   \\[\n   P(x) = (x - 1)Q(x)\n   \\]\n   where \\( Q(x) \\) must adjust such that \\( P(x) \\) hits the required points: \n   \\( P(2^{k}) = k \\) for \\( k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 2011 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Deeper Exploration\n\n#### **Interpolation Approach**\n\nLagrange interpolation seems suitable given that specific \\( y \\) values correspond to specific \\( x \\) values. I'm thinking:\n\nThe value \\( f(x) = k \\) at \\( x = 2^k \\) suggests constructing separate terms that achieve these effects, especially since interpolation is nice when degree equals the number of points minus 1.\n\nEach term in polynomial form can be like:\n\\[ L_k(x) = \\prod_{\\substack{j=1 \\\\ j \\neq k}}^{2011} \\frac{x - 2^j}{2^k - 2^j} \\]\nfor each \\( k \\), scaling appropriately for each term.\n\nCan this help? Let's break it further down.\n\n#### **Coefficient of \\( x \\) term**\n\nConsidering Lagrange polynomials, each constructed polynomial term has magnitude and degree already fixed due to \\( n=2011 \\). What remains is determining that desired linear coefficient of \\( x \\) in the overall polynomial.\n\n---\n\n#### **Construct **\n\nMy suspicion: any linear term in \\( P(x) \\) comes from how these terms overlap with a linear term \\( ax \\) component within each portion of the polynomial.\n\n- The coefficients \\( A_k \\) (for terms \\( L_k(x) \\)) in front capture \\( f(x) = k\\).\n- Looking at the term considering \\( x \\) linear terms contribution in formulations involves leveraging how such polynomial segments break:\n\\[ L_k(2^m): m \\neq k\\]\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Check & Validation\n\n##### Polynomial Structure Back-check\n\nFormulate a check on \\( x-1 \\) term. Given all \\( x \\) values located at \\( 2^k - 1 \\):\n\n- Think of unfolding from: \n\\[ (x - 1)(x-2)\\ldots(x - 2^{2011}) \\]\n\nEvaluating the polynomial's form contributions in Taylor expansion-like implications for linear contributions should be the final excuse or rationale.\n\n##### Polynomial coefficients nonstandard functions... Magic check plays role.\n\nFinally peeking into answering: especially with negative offsets or transformations via derivative evaluations at symmetrical placeholders.\n\n---\n\n### Final Steps\n\nAfter executing interpolations, checking constraints: summing directly adding potential format contributions repeatedly has unusual methods omitted. Wait!\n\nRealize something missed for investigation focuses:\n\nSome unexpected seeing simplification not comprehended prior with rather \\( b^{c} \\), potentially large divisors.\n\nAfter comprehensive explorations, synthesis reiterating that was:\n\n- Verifying that we must have:\n\\[\nx + 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Result Interpretation:\n\nTrying repetitive operations evaluating contribute measure results in obtaining sum:\n\\[ a + b + c = \\text{Total form coefficient reflection aggregate}.\\]\n\n---\n\nSummarizing with clarity now:\n\nThe correct answer of solving is:\n- \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} = 2012 - \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n- Therefore, with parameters extract:\n\\[ a + b + c = 2012 + 2 + 1 = 2015.\\]\n\nEverything re-evaluated to proceed with this finding confirms.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe process can sound repetitive slightly, with reflective refusals; however, recognizing after unsuccessful fast prevalidation attempts, structural formats of composed estimations, conceptual underpinnings transmutes outcome prominently evolved evaluating polynomial resolutions' essence lending straightforward interpretation highlights solved via:\n\\[ a + b + c = 2015 \\]\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous attempt to solve the problem. Let's re-evaluate the solution with a more structured approach and see if I can integrate the correct reasoning.\n\n### Rethinking the Problem\n\nGiven the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) with conditions \\( P(2^n) = n \\) for \\( n = 0, 1, \\ldots, 2011 \\), it's a degree-2011 polynomial, and I'm tasked with finding the coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( P(x) \\), expressed as \\( a - \\frac{1}{b^c} \\).\n\n### Re-evaluating the Approach\n\n1. **Reformulating the Polynomial:**\n   Based on what I've derived, let's look at forming a new polynomial \\( Q(x) = P(2x) - P(x) - 1 \\). We know from the problem conditions that:\n   \\[\n   Q(2^n) = 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad n = 0, 1, \\ldots, 2010.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Structure of \\( Q(x) \\):**\n   Since \\( Q(x) \\) has these roots, it can be represented as:\n   \\[\n   Q(x) = c(x - 1)(x - 2) \\ldots (x - 2^{2010})\n   \\]\n   where \\( c \\) is a constant.\n\n3. **Determining the Constant \\( c \\):**\n   Knowing \\( Q(0) = -1 \\) (since it equals \\( P(0) - P(0) - 1 \\)), we can determine:\n   \\[\n   Q(0) = c(-1)(-2)\\ldots (-2^{2010}) = -2^{1 + 2 + \\ldots + 2010} c = -2^{2010 \\cdot 2011 / 2} c\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( c = \\frac{1}{2^{2010 \\cdot 2011 / 2}} \\).\n\n4. **Expressing \\( Q(x) \\):**\n   Now, rewrite:\n   \\[\n   Q(x) = \\frac{(x-1)(x-2)\\ldots(x-2^{2010})}{2^{2010 \\cdot 2011 / 2}}\n   \\]\n   This form aligns with the structure necessary for making \\( Q(2^n) = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Coefficient of \\( x \\):**\n   Let's find the coefficient of \\( x \\) in this expression for \\( Q(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   Q(x) = (x - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} x - 1 \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{2^2} x - 1 \\right) \\ldots \\left( \\frac{1}{2^{2010}} x - 1 \\right)\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\( x \\) is:\n   \\[\n   1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{2^{2010}}\n   \\]\n   This sum is:\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1 \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{2^{2011}})}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = 2 - \\frac{1}{2^{2010}}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\( x \\) in \\( P(x) \\) is \\( 2 - \\frac{1}{2^{2010}} \\), implying \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), and \\( c = 2010 \\). Finally, summing these gives:\n\\[\na + b + c = 2 + 2 + 2010 = \\boxed{2014}\n\\] \n\nThis step-by-step re-evaluation helps confirm that the solution is now correct.",
