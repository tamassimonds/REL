    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, we need to really understand what the problem is asking us to do. We have this interesting operation defined as \\( a \\star b = (a + b)b \\). Our task is to calculate the value of \\((3 \\star 5) - (5 \\star 3)\\). \n\nFirst thoughts: \n- At first glance, the operation \\( \\star \\) seems like a kind of modification of multiplication where we first add two numbers and then multiply by the second number. \n- This feels somewhat similar to a distribution operation because we're multiplying after an addition, but it's customized for this particular problem.\n\nLet's write down how we might calculate each part separately:\n\n**Part 1: Calculate \\( 3 \\star 5 \\):**  \nAccording to the definition, \\( a \\star b = (a + b)b \\). So, applying this to \\( 3 \\star 5 \\):\n1. Add 3 and 5: \n   \\[\n   3 + 5 = 8\n   \\]\n2. Multiply the result by 5:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 5 = 40\n   \\]\nReflection: Hmm, that seems straightforward. \\(3 \\star 5\\) gives us 40.\n\n**Part 2: Calculate \\( 5 \\star 3 \\):**  \nApplying the same operation:\n1. Add 5 and 3:\n   \\[\n   5 + 3 = 8\n   \\]\n2. Multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 3 = 24\n   \\]\nReflection: Looks good. \\(5 \\star 3\\) results in 24.\n\n**Now, Calculate \\((3 \\star 5) - (5 \\star 3)\\):**  \n1. We already found that \\(3 \\star 5 = 40\\) and \\(5 \\star 3 = 24\\).\n2. Subtract these:\n   \\[\n   40 - 24 = 16\n   \\]\n\nReflection: Okay, let me step back and quickly verify. The operations all seem correct\u2014and while our steps used the operation definition correctly and simply followed our arithmetic rules, the subtraction also checks out.\n\nConclusion: The answer to the problem is 16.\n\nI feel confident in the approach because each step logically followed from the problem's instructions, and basic arithmetic checks confirm that the operations were done correctly. No steps seemed off, miscalculated, or misinterpreted. So, the result is satisfactorily obtained.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $3 \\star 5 = (3 + 5)5 = 8\\cdot 5 = 40$ and $5 \\star 3 = (5 + 3)3 = 8\\cdot 3 = 24$, we have \\[\n3\\star5 - 5\\star3 = 40 - 24 = \\boxed{16}.\n\\]"
