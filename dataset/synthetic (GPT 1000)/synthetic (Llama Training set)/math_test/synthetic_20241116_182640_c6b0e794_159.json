    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this step by step. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: \nThis problem involves a polynomial expression with distinct real numbers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The degree of this polynomial needs to be determined. Initially, it looks like a sum of rational functions, but knowing the typical behavior of such expressions might help.\n\nInitial hunch: \nBecause the denominator for each term is just a constant (no \\(x\\) terms), factoring these constants might simplify things. Potentially, the degree of the numerator\u2014depending only on \\(x\\)\u2014is key.\n\n### Step 2: Expression Simplification\n\nLet's explore each term:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{(x-b)(x-c)}{(a-b)(a-c)}\\)  \n   - This has a numerator of degree 2: \\((x-b)(x-c)\\) which expands to \\(x^2 - (b+c)x + bc\\).\n\n2. \\(\\frac{(x-a)(x-c)}{(b-a)(b-c)}\\)  \n   - This also has a numerator of degree 2: \\((x-a)(x-c)\\) which expands to \\(x^2 - (a+c)x + ac\\).\n\n3. \\(\\frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{(c-a)(c-b)}\\)  \n   - Again, this has a numerator of degree 2: \\((x-a)(x-b)\\) which expands to \\(x^2 - (a+b)x + ab\\).\n\n### Checkpoint: What We've Found\n\nEach term is a rational function with a numerator of degree 2 and a denominator that is a constant. This indicates that each term individually is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nBut what happens when you add these three terms?\n\n### Step 3: Adding Terms Together\n\nWhen adding these terms:\n- All terms have the same degree (2), and each comes with a full polynomial of similar form but different constants.\n\nConsider the possibility of cancellation. Is there symmetry or any special property that results from these specific constructions of the terms?\n\n### Step 4: Consideration of Symmetry\n\nOh! This reminds me of symmetric polynomials, where some structure leads to cancelation, often yielding a surprising simplification.\n\nThink about:\n- Evaluating \\(p(x)\\) at \\(x=a\\), \\(x=b\\), and \\(x=c\\). If \\(p(x)\\) equals 1 at each of these points (given each term effectively acts like Lagrange Interpolation), it might suggest something about the polynomial's simplicity or degree.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate at Specific Points\n\n1. **Evaluate at \\(x=a\\):**  \n    \\[\n    \\frac{(a-b)(a-c)}{(a-b)(a-c)} + 0 + 0 = 1\n    \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate at \\(x=b\\):**  \n    \\[\n    0 + \\frac{(b-a)(b-c)}{(b-a)(b-c)} + 0 = 1\n    \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate at \\(x=c\\):**  \n    \\[\n    0 + 0 + \\frac{(c-a)(c-b)}{(c-a)(c-b)} = 1\n    \\]\n\nThis strongly suggests that the polynomial is \\(p(x) = 1\\) everywhere for distinct \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nIf \\(p(x) = 1\\), then the polynomial is a constant, indicating the polynomial degree is \\(0\\). The symmetry and specific construction led to complete cancellation of higher degree terms.\n\nFinal check: \nYes, this approach logically checks out, and evaluations at \\(x=a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) support \\(p(x) = 1\\). Re-visiting Lagrange Interpolation, these expressions cover the interpolation for any constant polynomial that passes distinctly through particular points.\n\nThus, the degree of the polynomial \\(p(x)\\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Note that $p(x)$ has degree at most 2.  Also, $p(a) = p(b) = p(c) = 1.$  Thus, the polynomials $p(x)$ and 1 agree at three different values, so by the Identity Theorem, they are the same polynomial.  Hence, the degree of $p(x)$ (which is the constant polynomial 1) is $\\boxed{0}.$\n\nYou can check manually that\n\\[p(x) = \\frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \\frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \\frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}\\]simplifies to 1."
