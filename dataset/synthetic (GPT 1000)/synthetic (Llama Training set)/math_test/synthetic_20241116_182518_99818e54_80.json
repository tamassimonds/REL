    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it step-by-step.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so we need to figure out how much change they have in cents after they've pooled their money together and converted as many of their earnings into dollar bills as possible. The question involves dealing with dollar amounts and converting them, which suggests currency conversion is involved \u2014 but since it's all in dollars, it's probably about handling the fractional parts (cents) appropriately. This feels similar to problems in the past where I've needed to work with money, particularly ensuring decimals (cents) are correctly managed.\n\n**Step 1: Summing Up Earned Amounts**\n\nLet's start by determining the total amount of money Alice, Bailey, Cindy, and Daniel collectively earned.\n\n- Alice earned: $25.67\n- Bailey earned: $17.21\n- Cindy earned: $39.17\n- Daniel earned: $26.32\n\nAdding these amounts together:\n\\[ \n25.67 + 17.21 + 39.17 + 26.32 \n\\]\n\nHmm, it feels like a calculator could simplify this, but let me just jot it down for clarity before that:\n\n- Adding Alice's and Bailey\u2019s earnings: \\( 25.67 + 17.21 = 42.88 \\).\n- Next, add Cindy\u2019s: \\( 42.88 + 39.17 = 82.05 \\).\n- Finally, add Daniel\u2019s: \\( 82.05 + 26.32 = 108.37 \\).\n\nSo the total amount earned by all of them is $108.37.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems right. Adding step by step helps ensure no mistakes slip in. I doubled checked calculations using digits starting from the right (cents) to the left (dollars).\n\n**Step 2: Focusing on Cents**\n\nAlright, they want to know how many cents are left over after converting to dollars. This means we\u2019re trying to figure out the fractional dollar part \u2014 in cents.\n\nThe amount $108.37 suggests $108 dollars were converted neatly into bills, while the .37 part remains in coins (cents), and that's what we\u2019re looking to evaluate. \n\n**Step 3: Calculation of Remaining Cents**\n\nClearly, the fractional part .37 represents 37 cents. Since there\u2019s no further dollar to convert from .37 dollars, these are left as is.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nBy looking at the decimal of the total earnings, we can deduce the last two to the right of the decimal point represent cents directly. Initially, it matches our goal \u2014 just confirming.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nTherefore, after pooling and converting their earnings into dollar bills, Alice, Bailey, Cindy, and Daniel are left with 37 cents in change.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIt seems straightforward now \u2014 understanding that dealing with fractional parts in dollars directly equates to handling cents. I could have been misled into thinking this requires a more complex operation, but it really is about reading money values as they are commonly expressed. It reminds me to always look at currency problems in terms of units and subunits directly \u2014 simplifies a lot.",

  "ground_truth": "Instead of adding large numbers together, we can find the residue for each person for easier computation. We convert the amount they earned to cents and find the modulo $100$ for each.  \\begin{align*}\n2567 &\\equiv 67 \\pmod{100}\\\\\n1721 &\\equiv 21 \\pmod{100}\\\\\n3917 &\\equiv 17 \\pmod{100}\\\\\n2632 &\\equiv 32 \\pmod{100}\n\\end{align*}We want to find the modulo $100$ of the total number of cents. We can add the separate residues to get $$67+21+17+32 \\equiv 137 \\equiv 37 \\pmod{100}$$Therefore, they have $\\boxed{37}$ cents left after converting as much of the money into bills as possible."
