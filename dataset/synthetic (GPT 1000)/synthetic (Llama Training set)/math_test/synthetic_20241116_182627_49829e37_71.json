    "working_out": "### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nAlright, let\u2019s break down the problem. We have a total of seven people: four politicians and three lawyers. The politicians shake hands with everyone there once, and the lawyers shake hands with each politician once. Sounds straightforward, but it deserves a closer look. \n\nNow, I need to calculate the total number of handshakes. Initially, I'm thinking this might relate to combination counting or some detailed pairing \u2013 but let\u2019s see...\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Fixed Formula or Total Combinations:** One way could be to calculate handshakes as combinations, but my gut says this might overcomplicate the problem since the lawyers don't shake hands with other lawyers.\n2. **Breaking it into Parts:** Another idea is to break down who shakes hands with whom, perhaps group-by-group.\n3. **Systematic Counting:** A systematic manual count\u2014though that can be tedious, it\u2019s often foolproof.\n\nHmmm, the second option seems more practical. Let\u2019s systematically consider each set of handshakes.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Politicians\u2019 Handshakes\n\nEach politician will shake hands once with each of the three lawyers and the other three politicians.\n\n- So, for Politicians (considering just the politicians first):\n  - Politician 1 shakes hands with Politicians 2, 3, and 4.\n  - Politician 2 shakes with Politicians 3 and 4 (since 1-2 is already counted).\n  - Politician 3 shakes with Politician 4.\n  \nThis gives us handshakes within politicians as: \\( \\frac{4(4-1)}{2} = 6 \\) handshakes, based on combinations formula \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 4: Considering Politicians and Lawyers\n\nNow each of the four politicians shakes hands with each of the three lawyers.\n\n- There are 4 politicians and 3 lawyers, making a straightforward calculation:\n  - \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\) handshakes between politicians and lawyers.\n\n### Step 5: Total Handshakes\n\nTime to add up my calculations:\n\n- Politicians\u2019 internal handshakes: 6\n- Politicians shaking hands with lawyers: 12\n\nTotal handshakes = 6 (politicians among themselves) + 12 (politicians with lawyers) = 18 handshakes.\n\n### Step 6: Reflect and Verify\n\nHmm, does this result make sense?\n\n- Handshake between individuals is a mutual activity, meaning each is counted only once\u2014check.\n- I went through each group systematically (politicians alone, and politicians with lawyers)\u2014check.\n\nThis breakdown seems exhaustive and correct, as verified by stepping back through each step logically. It's important that we didn't double-count and considered each possible combination sensibly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe total number of handshakes at the party is **18**. The approach of breaking it down into manageable chunks and focusing specifically on each category of participants indeed holds up upon reflection.",

  "ground_truth": "We can count the total number of handshakes by counting the lawyers shaking hands with each of the politicians and then the politicians shaking hands among themselves.\n\nIf each lawyer shakes hands with each of the politicians, then each lawyer shakes hands with four people. Since there are three lawyers, $4 \\cdot 3 = 12$ handshakes occur.\n\nIf each politician shakes hands with each of the other politicians, the first shakes hands with three others, the second shakes hands with two others (not counting the handshake with the first that has already transpired), and the last two each shake the hand of the other. Thus, there are $3 + 2 + 1 = 6$ handshakes that occur.\n\nSo, $12 + 6 = \\boxed{18}$ total handshakes take place."
