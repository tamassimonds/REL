    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's make sure we clearly understand the task. We have a triangle with vertices at the points \\((1, 2)\\), \\((7, 10)\\), and \\((1, 12)\\). The goal is to find the number of units in the length of the shortest side of this triangle.\n\n### Brainstorming a Strategy\n\n1. **Initial Thoughts:** \n   - This seems like it might involve the distance formula since we're given points on a coordinate plane.\n   - Since it's a triangle, I'll need to calculate the distances (lengths of the sides) between each pair of vertices.\n\n2. **Different Approaches:**\n   - **Distance Formula:** Using the distance formula \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\) to find the length of each side.\n   - **Visual Check:** Since one pair of x-coordinates is the same, checking if there's a vertical side might simplify calculations.\n\n3. **Checking Simplicity:**\n   - Identifying any vertical or horizontal sides would simplify the calculations greatly.\n\n### Calculating Side Lengths\n\nLet's use the distance formula for each pair of points:\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate Distance Between \\((1, 2)\\) and \\((7, 10)\\)\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(7 - 1)^2 + (10 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 64} = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n\\]\nThe length of this side is 10 units.\n\n#### Step 2: Calculate Distance Between \\((7, 10)\\) and \\((1, 12)\\)\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(1 - 7)^2 + (12 - 10)^2} = \\sqrt{(-6)^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 4} = \\sqrt{40}\n\\]\nThe length of this side is \\(\\sqrt{40}\\) units, which simplifies to \\(2\\sqrt{10}\\).\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate Distance Between \\((1, 2)\\) and \\((1, 12)\\)\n\nHere, since the x-coordinates are the same, we have a vertical side. So, we just calculate the absolute difference in y-coordinates:\n\\[\nd = |12 - 2| = 10\n\\]\nThe length of this side is 10 units.\n\n### Reflecting on Calculations\n\nLet's reflect on what we have:\n\n- Side between \\((1, 2)\\) and \\((7, 10)\\): 10 units\n- Side between \\((7, 10)\\) and \\((1, 12)\\): \\(2\\sqrt{10}\\) units\n- Side between \\((1, 2)\\) and \\((1, 12)\\): 10 units\n\nThe lengths calculated make sense given the Pythagorean component; I've triple-checked the arithmetic.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNow, I need to determine the shortest side. The values are:\n- \\(10\\) units\n- \\(2\\sqrt{10}\\) units (approximately \\(6.32\\) units since \\(\\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.16\\))\n- \\(10\\) units\n\nThe shortest side is \\(2\\sqrt{10}\\) units.\n\n### Final Check\n\nEverything seems to line up well, and each calculation holds. I\u2019ve checked both the arithmetic and geometric intuition. The shortest side of the triangle is indeed \\(2\\sqrt{10}\\) units.",

  "ground_truth": "We must find the distance between each pair of points.\n\nThe distance between $(1, 2)$ and $(1, 12)$ is simply 10, since these two points have the same $x$-coordinate.\n\nThe distance between $(1, 2)$ and $(7, 10)$ is \\[\\sqrt{(1-7)^2 + (2-10)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 64} = 10.\\]\n\nThe distance between $(7, 10)$ and $(1, 12)$ is \\[\\sqrt{(7 - 1)^2 + (10 - 12)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 4} = 2\\sqrt{10}.\\]\n\nOut of 10, 10, and $2\\sqrt{10}$, $2\\sqrt{10}$ is the shortest value. We know this because $\\sqrt{10} > \\sqrt{9}$, so $\\sqrt{10} > 3$, so $2\\sqrt{10} < (\\sqrt{10})^2 = 10$. Thus, the shortest side of the triangle has length $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}$."
