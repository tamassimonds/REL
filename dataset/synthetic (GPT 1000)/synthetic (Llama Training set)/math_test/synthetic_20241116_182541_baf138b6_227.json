Instead of holding an election, the teacher decides to choose the two representatives at random.  What is the probability that both representatives will be Smith quadruplets?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about selecting representatives from a class with quadruplets. My first impression is that this is a classic probability problem. It feels similar to the kind of problems where we calculate probabilities using combinations, like drawing cards from a deck or selecting committee members. But, I want to think through this carefully to understand if there are any nuances because of the quadruplets.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe class has 25 students; four of these are the famous Smith quadruplets. We need to pick two representatives randomly. The question asks for the probability that both students picked are the Smith quadruplets.\n\nMy initial thought is to approach this problem by comparing two things: the number of ways to pick two Smith quadruplets out of the four, and the number of ways to pick any two students from the entire class. I'm leaning towards using combinations because I'm dealing with selections without regard to order.\n\n**Step 2: Total Number of Ways to Select Two Students**\n\nThe formula for combinations is \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\).\n\nTotal students = 25, choosing 2:  \n\\[ C(25, 2) = \\frac{25 \\times 24}{2 \\times 1} = 300 \\]\n\nThis is the total number of ways to select any two students from the class.\n\n**Step 3: Number of Ways to Select Two Smith Quadruplets**\n\nNow, I focus on just the Smith quadruplets group, which consists of 4 students. Picking 2 of these:  \n\\[ C(4, 2) = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6 \\]\n\nThis is the number of ways to select 2 students from the 4 Smith quadruplets.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Probability**\n\nProbability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the number of possible outcomes. In this case, favorable is both students being Smith quadruplets.\n\nProbability \\( P \\) that both students are Smith quadruplets is given by:  \n\\[ P = \\frac{C(4, 2)}{C(25, 2)} = \\frac{6}{300} = \\frac{1}{50} \\]\n\n**Step 5: Reflecting on the Solution**\n\nHmm, let's take a moment to reflect. Does this approach make sense? I'm using combinations correctly, I think, since order doesn't matter in selecting the students. Okay, quick check: with 300 possible pairs of students, and 6 of those pairs being made up entirely of quadruplets, it seems reasonable that the probability is 1 out of 50.\n\nIs there anything I missed? Let's see... I didn't overlook any other groups or dynamics in the class. Seems like all checks are good.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe probability that both representatives chosen are Smith quadruplets is \\(\\frac{1}{50}\\).\n\nThis process flowed quite well for this scenario, and breaking down the steps helped ensure I didn't overlook anything important.

  "ground_truth": "There are ${25 \\choose 2} = 300$ possible pairs of student representatives. Of these, since there are 4 Smith quadruplets, there are ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs in which both representatives are Smith quadruplets. So, the probability of both representatives being Smith quadruplets is $\\frac{6}{300} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$."
