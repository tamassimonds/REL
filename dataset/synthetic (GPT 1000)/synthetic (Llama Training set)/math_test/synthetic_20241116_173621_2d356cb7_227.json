    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this geometry problem step by step. The challenge here is to find the area of a rhombus given its perimeter and one of its diagonals. Let's think this through.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWhen I see a problem about a rhombus, I immediately remember some key properties of rhombuses:\n- All sides are equal.\n- The diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\nThe problem gives us:\n- The perimeter is 68 units.\n- One of the diagonals is 30 units.\n\nWe need to find the area. Sounds doable. I think the main trick here will involve using the rhombus properties and right triangle geometry.\n\n### Step 2: Explore Strategies\nThe area of a rhombus can be calculated with the formula:  \n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{d_1 \\cdot d_2}{2} \\]  \nwhere \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\) are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\nSince we only know one diagonal, finding the other diagonal seems important. Let's explore how to do that.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the Known Perimeter\nThe perimeter of a rhombus is the total length around the figure, which equals four times one side:\n\\[ 4s = 68 \\]\nSo each side length \\(s\\) is:\n\\[ s = \\frac{68}{4} = 17 \\]\nOkay, so each side of the rhombus is 17 units.\n\n### Step 4: Use the Right Triangle Structure\nThe diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, creating right-angled triangles inside the rhombus.\n\nOne of the diagonals is given as 30 units. Let's denote the unknown diagonal as \\(d_2\\), and since the diagonals bisect each other, each half would be \\(\\frac{d_2}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem on one of these right triangles. The sides of the triangle are:\n- Half of diagonal \\(d_1 = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\\)\n- Half of unknown diagonal \\(d_2 = \\frac{d_2}{2}\\)\n- The side of the rhombus \\(s = 17\\)\n\nApplying the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[ 15^2 + \\left(\\frac{d_2}{2}\\right)^2 = 17^2 \\]\n\nCalculating further:\n\\[ 225 + \\left(\\frac{d_2}{2}\\right)^2 = 289 \\]\n\nSubtract 225 from both sides:\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{d_2}{2}\\right)^2 = 64 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\frac{d_2}{2}\\):\n\\[ \\frac{d_2}{2} = 8 \\]\n\nSo, \\(d_2 = 16\\).\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Area of the Rhombus\nNow that we have both diagonals \\(d_1 = 30\\) and \\(d_2 = 16\\), we can calculate the area:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{d_1 \\cdot d_2}{2} = \\frac{30 \\cdot 16}{2} \\]\n\nLet me quickly calculate that:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{480}{2} = 240 \\]\n\n### Step 7: Reflect and Check\nDoes this make sense? \n- The calculations were straightforward.\n- I used all the given information effectively.\n\nI can move forward with confidence that the area of the rhombus is indeed **240 square units**.\n\nThis problem went fairly smoothly after considering the geometry of the rhombus and applying the Pythagorean theorem correctly to find the missing diagonal.",

  "ground_truth": "If a rhombus has a perimeter of 68 units, then its side length must be 17. Since diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, the right triangle that is formed has one leg of length 15 and another leg of length 8. Therefore, the area of one of the right triangles is $\\frac{8 \\times 15}{2} = 60$, so since the rhombus is made up of four congruent right triangles, the area of the rhombus is $60 \\times 4 = \\boxed{240}$."
