    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\nWhen I see the problem, the first thing that comes to mind is that we're dealing with a triangle with specific side lengths: 6, 8, and 10. A circumradius is the radius of the circle that passes through all three vertices of the triangle. Immediately, I recognize this triangle as a right triangle since it follows the Pythagorean theorem: \\(6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2\\).\n\nStrategy Brainstorming:\n1. **Using the formula for the circumradius \\(R\\):** For a right triangle, the circumradius \\(R\\) is known to be half the length of the hypotenuse. This is a straightforward method since I've recognized the triangle as a right triangle.\n\n2. **General Formula:** I could use the formula \\(R = \\frac{abc}{4K}\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the sides of the triangle, and \\(K\\) is the area of the triangle. For a right triangle, \\(K\\) (the area) is simply \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{leg}_1 \\times \\text{leg}_2\\).\n\n3. **Exploring Geometry Tools:** Consider the properties of triangles and circles. Maybe there are other geometric insights or constructions that could help.\n\nReflecting on Strategy:\nGiven this is a right triangle, the point about the circumradius being half the hypotenuse is compelling. However, let\u2019s just explore all ideas to ensure understanding and solidify the reasoning.\n\nCalculation using Right Triangle Property:\n- As identified, this is a right triangle with the hypotenuse of length 10. The circumradius for a right triangle is given by:\n  \\[\n  R = \\frac{\\text{hypotenuse}}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n  \\]\n\nVerification via General Formula:\n- Calculate the area \\(K\\):\n  \\[\n  K = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 8 = 24\n  \\]\n\n- Use the circumradius formula \\(R = \\frac{abc}{4K}\\):\n  \\[\n  R = \\frac{6 \\times 8 \\times 10}{4 \\times 24} = \\frac{480}{96} = 5\n  \\]\n\nAfter double-checking:\nThe calculation aligns perfectly, confirming that the right triangle property holds true in this case as expected. This gives me more confidence in the derived value.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nThe circumradius of the triangle with sides 6, 8, and 10 is, indeed, \\( R = 5 \\).\n\nThought check: The process seemed correct at every step, and both methods reconciled the same result. I feel good about this solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that $ABC$ is a right triangle with hypotenuse 10.  The circumcenter of a right triangle is the midpoint of its hypotenuse, so the circumradius of a right triangle is half the length of its hypotenuse.  Therefore, the circumradius of $\\triangle ABC$ is $10/2 = \\boxed{5}$."
