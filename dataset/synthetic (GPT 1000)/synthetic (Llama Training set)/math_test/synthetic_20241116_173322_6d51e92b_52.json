    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\nWhen we want to find the volume of a tetrahedron given its vertices, the process often involves using coordinate geometry. Instinctively, I recall that there is a formula involving determinants to calculate the volume of a tetrahedron. This problem also reminds me of calculating areas in trilateral coordinates, though extended to three dimensions. I know there's a neat determinant formula to use for this scenario involving the position vectors of the vertices.\n\nExploring Different Strategies:\n1. Determinant Method: Use the determinant formula for volume calculation, which involves computing a determinant of a 4x4 matrix constructed from the vertices.\n2. Vector and Cross Product: Calculate vectors for sides of the tetrahedron and use the triple scalar product (dot product of a vector with a cross product of two others).\n3. Simpler Geometrical Approach: Given specific coordinate values, these may simplify calculations if vertices form any special geometric shape\u2014though this seems unlikely.\n\nI think the most straightforward method here would be the determinant approach because it directly uses the vertices' coordinates, so let's try that first.\n\nUnderstanding the Formula:\nThe volume \\( V \\) of a tetrahedron with vertices \\((x_1, y_1, z_1)\\), \\((x_2, y_2, z_2)\\), \\((x_3, y_3, z_3)\\), and \\((x_4, y_4, z_4)\\) can be calculated as:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{6} \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\nx_2-x_1 & y_2-y_1 & z_2-z_1 \\\\\nx_3-x_1 & y_3-y_1 & z_3-z_1 \\\\\nx_4-x_1 & y_4-y_1 & z_4-z_1\n\\end{pmatrix} \\right|\n\\]\nThis determinant gives six times the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nApplying the Formula:\nAssigning points \\(A = (0,1,2)\\), \\(B = (3,0,1)\\), \\(C = (4,3,6)\\), and \\(D = (2,3,2)\\).\n\nCompute vectors based on differences:\n- \\( \\mathbf{AB} = B - A = (3, -1, -1) \\)\n- \\( \\mathbf{AC} = C - A = (4, 2, 4) \\)\n- \\( \\mathbf{AD} = D - A = (2, 2, 0) \\)\n\nNow compute the determinant:\n\\[\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n4 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculate:\n1. Select the first row element \\(3\\) and eliminate its row and column:\n   \\[\n   3 \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n   2 & 4 \\\\\n   2 & 0\n   \\end{pmatrix} = 3(2 \\times 0 - 4 \\times 2) = 3(0 - 8) = -24\n   \\]\n2. Select the second element \\(-1\\) and calculate:\n   \\[\n   -(-1) \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n   4 & 4 \\\\\n   2 & 0\n   \\end{pmatrix} = 1(4 \\times 0 - 4 \\times 2) = 1(0 - 8) = -8\n   \\]\n3. Select the third element \\(-1\\) and consider:\n   \\[\n   -1 \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n   4 & 2 \\\\\n   2 & 2\n   \\end{pmatrix} = -1(4 \\times 2 - 2 \\times 2) = -1(8 - 4) = -4\n   \\]\n\nSumming these results for the determinant:\n\\[\n-24 - 8 - 4 = -36\n\\]\n\nThus, the absolute value is \\(36\\). The volume, therefore, is:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 36 = 6\n\\]\n\nChecks and Reflection:\n- Double check determinant calculation: Looks consistent since there's significant variation in input, such as signs and factors.\n- The logic applied here matches expected application of determinant and vectors.\n- I\u2019m confident in the determinant method here, especially seeing consistent calculations.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe volume of the tetrahedron with the given vertices is \\(6\\) cubic units.",
