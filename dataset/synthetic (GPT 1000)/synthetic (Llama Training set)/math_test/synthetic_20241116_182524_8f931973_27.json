    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. \n\n### First Thoughts\nThis problem involves finding distinct rectangles with integer side lengths where the area equals five times the perimeter. My first thought is to express this condition mathematically. It looks like we'll need to use the formulas for the area and perimeter of a rectangle:\n- Area \\( A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\)\n- Perimeter \\( P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\)\n\nWe're looking for:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = 5 \\times \\text{Perimeter} \\]\n\nThis translates to:\n\\[ \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 5 \\times 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) \\]\n\nMy gut tells me to start substituting variables for length and width and see if a simple algebraic manipulation can lead to an equation I can solve. The part about integer values suggests I might have to do some trial and error or solve a simpler equation.\n\n### Setting Up the Equation\nLet's denote the length by \\( l \\) and the width by \\( w \\).\nThen our main equation becomes:\n\\[ lw = 5 \\times 2 \\times (l + w) \\]\n\nSimplify that to:\n\\[ lw = 10(l + w) \\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[ lw - 10l - 10w = 0 \\]\n\nTo simplify further, let me add 100 to both sides, hoping it might factor nicely:\n\\[ lw - 10l - 10w + 100 = 100 \\]\n\nThat gives us:\n\\[ (l-10)(w-10) = 100 \\]\n\nWow, that worked out neatly. So, I need to find pairs \\((l-10, w-10)\\) whose product is 100, reflecting the fact that the sides can only be integer values. We should now solve for possible \\( l \\) and \\( w \\).\n\n### Solving for Integer Solutions\nLet's find all pairs of numbers \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(a \\times b = 100\\). Reminder: \\(a = l-10\\) and \\(b = w-10\\). \n\nThe factors of 100 are:\n\\(1 \\times 100\\),\n\\(2 \\times 50\\),\n\\(4 \\times 25\\),\n\\(5 \\times 20\\),\n\\(10 \\times 10\\).\n\nGiven these pairs, calculate corresponding \\((l, w)\\) pairs:\n- \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 100\\) gives \\(l = 11\\), \\(w = 110\\)\n- \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 50\\) gives \\(l = 12\\), \\(w = 60\\)\n- \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = 25\\) gives \\(l = 14\\), \\(w = 35\\)\n- \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 20\\) gives \\(l = 15\\), \\(w = 30\\)\n- \\(a = 10\\), \\(b = 10\\) gives \\(l = 20\\), \\(w = 20\\)\n\n### Reflection and Check\nEach of these pairs \\((l, w)\\) is a rectangle that satisfies the area-to-perimeter condition. \n- For each solution, just swap roles of \\(l\\) and \\(w\\) if they are different to see if that results in new solution (spoiler: it usually doesn\u2019t due to symmetry in multiplication).\n- In some problem contexts, \\((l,w)\\) and \\((w,l)\\) might be considered the same. However, here it looks like two rectangles are distinct unless congruent which they are in swaps only when \\(l=w\\).\n\nLet\u2019s double-check:\n\\[ (11\\times110=5\\times242), (12\\times60=5\\times144), \\ldots \\]\nI've manually verified one quickly. Let me re-verify all by calculating:\n\\[ 11 \\times 110 = 1210 = 5 \\times (242) \\]\n\\[ 12 \\times 60 = 720 = 5 \\times (144) \\]\n\\[ 14 \\times 35 = 490 = 5 \\times (98) \\]\n\\[ 15 \\times 30 = 450 = 5 \\times (90) \\]\n\\[ 20 \\times 20 = 400 = 5 \\times (80) \\]\n\nEvery solution checks out. Therefore, there are **5 distinct rectangles** meeting the requirements of the problem. \n\nThis process of analysis helped me separate out the possible integer solutions, checking each for correctness, and ensuring symmetry wasn\u2019t missed. \n\n**Conclusion**\nWe found five pairs of integer solutions \\((l, w)\\), each representing distinct viable rectangles, thus concluding there are 5 distinct rectangles where area is five times the perimeter.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the side lengths of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$ with $a\\leq b$. Then $ab=10(a+b).$ Expanding and moving all the terms to the left hand side gives $ab-10a-10b=0.$ We apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $100$ to both sides to allow us to factor the left hand side: $$ab-10a-10b+100 = (a-10)(b-10)=100$$From this, we know that $(a-10,b-10)$ must be a pair of factors of $100$. Consequently, the pairs $(a,b)$ that provide different areas are $(11,110),$ $(12, 60),$ $(14, 35),$ $(15, 30),$ and $(20,20)$. There are therefore $\\boxed{5}$ distinct rectangles with the desired property."
