    "working_out": "**First Impressions:**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I'm immediately reminded of other problems involving rates and times. Specifically, I've dealt with problems that calculate distance traveled using the formula: \n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\] \n\nThis is a typical application of the distance-speed-time relationship. Okay, that's a good starting point. But let's dig deeper into the specifics of this problem.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- The speed here is given as 50 miles per hour. \n- The time is expressed as a mixed number: \\(2\\frac{3}{4}\\) hours. That's interesting because we'll likely need to convert it to an improper fraction or a decimal for easier calculation. \n- The problem asks for the answer as a mixed number, which means I need to be careful how I shape the answer.\n\nI'm going to need to multiply these quantities, but what format should I use for \\(2\\frac{3}{4}\\) hours? Let's explore that.\n\n**Exploring Time Conversion:**\n\nLet\u2019s start by converting \\(2\\frac{3}{4}\\) into a more manageable form.\n\n- As an improper fraction: To convert \\(2\\frac{3}{4}\\) to an improper fraction, I would multiply the whole number 2 by the denominator 4, resulting in 8, and then add the numerator 3. So, \\(2\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{11}{4}\\).\n\nOh, I feel like this is on the right track. Let\u2019s proceed with this.\n\n**Calculation Phase:**\n\nGiven:\n- Speed = 50 miles per hour\n- Time = \\( \\frac{11}{4} \\) hours\n\nUsing the formula \\(\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\\), the calculation becomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 50 \\times \\frac{11}{4} \\]\n\nAlright, let's perform this multiplication:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\frac{50 \\times 11}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\frac{550}{4} \\]\n\n**Converting to Mixed Number:**\n\nNow, step back for a second. I need to convert \\(\\frac{550}{4}\\) into a mixed number. \n\n- Dividing 550 by 4 gives us 137 with a remainder. \\(550 \\div 4 = 137\\) with a remainder of 2.\n  \n- Hence, \\(\\frac{550}{4} = 137\\frac{2}{4}\\).\n\nWait, this fraction \\(\\frac{2}{4}\\) can be simplified. 2 divided by 4 is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSo, the proper answer should be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 137\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- I completed my calculations and arrived at \\(137\\frac{1}{2}\\) miles. \n- I feel pretty confident about my method since it aligned nicely with the typical distance formula.\n- I double-checked that \\(\\frac{2}{4}\\) simplifies correctly to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), ensuring the final mixed number is accurate.\n\nOverall, I believe this problem combines clear calculation steps with a bit of fraction manipulation to reach the correct mixed number conclusion.",

  "ground_truth": "In two hours, a car traveling at $50$ mph would travel $50$ mph $\\times 2$ hours $= 100$ miles. Now we find how far a car can travel in $3/4$ of an hour which is $50$ mph $\\times \\frac{3}{4}$ hours $ = \\frac{150}{4} = 37 \\frac{1}{2}$ miles. Thus, the car would travel a total of $100 + 37 \\frac{1}{2}= \\boxed{137 \\frac{1}{2}}$ miles."
