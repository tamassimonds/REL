    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through it step by step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nAt first glance, we're dealing with a problem of finding the intersection of a plane and a line in 3D space. The plane is defined by a point and a normal vector, and the line is identified by a point and a direction vector. This problem feels similar to the ones involving equations of lines and planes from geometry class. \n\n**Strategy Brainstorming**\n\n1. **Equations Involved:**\n   - The plane can be described by the equation involving the normal vector and the point on the plane.\n   - The line can be described parametrically using a direction vector and a point.\n\n2. **Approach:**\n   - Substitute the parametric equation of the line into the equation of the plane to find where they intersect.\n\n3. **Checks:**\n   - At each step, ensure that the calculations match up with the physical interpretation of lines and planes intersecting.\n   - Confirm that a solution exists since not all lines intersect a given plane.\n\n### Breaking it Down\n\n#### Step 1: Writing the Equation of the Plane\n\nThe normal vector of the plane is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}\\), and we have a point on the plane \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\nThe equation of a plane can be written as:\n\\[ 4(x - 1) + 5(y - 2) + 6(z - 3) = 0. \\]\n\nIf I expand this:\n\\[ 4x - 4 + 5y - 10 + 6z - 18 = 0 \\]\n\\[ 4x + 5y + 6z = 32. \\]\n\n#### Step 2: Parametric Equation of the Line\n\nFor the line, we have a point \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and a direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\nThe parametric equations of the line are:\n\\[ x = -1 - t, \\]\n\\[ y = 0 - t = -t, \\]\n\\[ z = 5 + 2t. \\]\n\nWhere \\( t \\) is the parameter.\n\n#### Step 3: Substituting into the Plane's Equation\n\nSubstitute the parametric equations of the line into the plane's equation:\n\\[ 4(-1 - t) + 5(-t) + 6(5 + 2t) = 32. \\]\n\nLet's simplify:\n\\[ -4 - 4t - 5t + 30 + 12t = 32. \\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ -4 + 30 + (12t - 4t - 5t) = 32. \\]\n\\[ 26 + 3t = 32. \\]\n\n### Check Work\n\nWait, let me double-check those numbers and coefficients just to make sure everything added up correctly.\n\n\\[ 26 + 3t = 32 \\]\n\nSubtract 26 from both sides:\n\\[ 3t = 6 \\]\n\nDivide by 3:\n\\[ t = 2. \\]\n\nLooks good so far.\n\n#### Step 4: Find the Intersection Point\n\nNow that we have \\( t = 2 \\), substitute back into the line's parametric equations to find the intersection point:\n\\[ x = -1 - 2 = -3, \\]\n\\[ y = -2, \\]\n\\[ z = 5 + 2(2) = 9. \\]\n\nSo, the intersection point is \\((-3, -2, 9)\\).\n\n### Reflection\n\nThis process seemed to work smoothly once the substitutions were made. It appears logical and consistent with the operation constructs of the line and plane interaction in geometric terms. The systematic substitution approach resolved into a linear equation, giving a scalar parameter which helped to pinpoint the intersection coordinates.\n\nAs a final step, let's confirm that this point actually satisfies the plane equation to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Verification:**\nPlug the point \\((-3, -2, 9)\\) back into \\(4x + 5y + 6z = 32\\):\n\n\\[ 4(-3) + 5(-2) + 6(9) = -12 - 10 + 54 = 32. \\]\n\nThis equation holds true, so the intersection point \\((-3, -2, 9)\\) is correct.\n\nAll in all, the solution appears to be thoroughly validated. Time to move on with certainty!",

  "ground_truth": "The line is parameterized by\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} -1 - t \\\\ -t \\\\ 5 + 2t \\end{pmatrix}.\\]If this vector belongs in the plane, then its difference with $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$ must be orthogonal to $\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix}.$  Thus,\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} -2 - t \\\\ -2 - t \\\\ 2 + 2t \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix} = 0.\\]Then $(-2 - t)(4) + (-2 - t)(5) + (2 + 2t)(6) = 0.$  Solving, we find $t = 2.$  Hence, the point of intersection is $\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 9 \\end{pmatrix}}.$"
