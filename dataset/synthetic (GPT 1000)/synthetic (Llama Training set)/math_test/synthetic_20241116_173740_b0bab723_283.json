    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's break down what's being asked. We have an expression: \\((2^1)(2^2)(2^3)\\cdots (2^{99})(2^{100})\\). If I can write this as a single integer, I need to find out what the tens and ones digits of that integer are and then find their product.\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Exploration\n\nThis looks like a product of powers of 2. Something in me is reminding me that whenever I have a sequence of exponential numbers like this, it might simplify using properties of exponents.\n\nProperties that come to mind: \n- Considering \\(n^a \\times n^b = n^{a+b}\\), can we apply this here?\n- The sum of consecutive integers pops up here because the exponents range from 1 to 100, so it might relate to the sum formula for consecutive numbers.\n\n### Calculating the Exponent\n\nLet's first simplify the expression using exponentiation rules:\n\\[\n(2^1)(2^2)(2^3)\\cdots (2^{99})(2^{100}) = 2^{1+2+3+\\cdots+99+100}\n\\]\nOh! This clearly might remind me of the sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers! I think the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100 is given by the formula:\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}, \\text{where } n = 100\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate \\(S_{100}\\):\n\\[\nS_{100} = \\frac{100 \\times (100+1)}{2} = \\frac{100 \\times 101}{2} = 5050\n\\]\n\nThe exponent simplifies to 5050. So the expression becomes:\n\\[\n2^{5050}\n\\]\n\n### Determine the Last Two Digits\n\nNow, I need to determine the last two digits (tens and ones) of \\(2^{5050}\\). Hmm, this is a massive number! Direct computation won't work. Oh, I remember something about cyclicity - powers of numbers tend to show cyclic patterns for their last digits!\n\n#### Looking for Patterns\n\n**Last Digit Pattern (Cyclicity):**\nFor powers of 2:\n- \\(2^1 = 2\\)\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n- \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n- \\(2^4 = 16\\) (last digit is 6)\n- \\(2^5 = 32\\) (last digit is 2 again)\n\nThe last digit of powers of 2 follows a cycle: 2, 4, 8, 6. It repeats every 4 numbers.\n\nNow the exponent 5050 \\(\\mod 4 = 2\\) (since 5050 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 2). Thus, the last digit of \\(2^{5050}\\) is the same as \\(2^2\\), which is 4.\n\n**Last Two Digits (Modulo 100):**\nI suspect this needs more than recognizing the pattern, as I need the tens digit.\n\nHmm, let's see - calculating modulo 100 is a bit more than a cycle check.\nWe could use Euler's theorem if my memory serves. I know:\n- Euler's theorem states \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\,(\\text{mod } n)\\) if \\(\\gcd(a, n) = 1\\).\n\nFor modulus 100:\n\\(\\phi(100) = 100 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 40\\).\n\nUsing Euler, we have:\n\\(2^{40} \\equiv 1 \\,(\\text{mod } 100)\\).\n\nNow, \\(2^{5050} = 2^{40 \\times 126 + 10} \\equiv (1^{126}) \\times 2^{10} \\equiv 2^{10} \\,(\\text{mod } 100)\\).\n\nI need to find \\(2^{10}\\):\n- \\(2^{10} = 1024\\)\n\nThe last two digits of 1024 are 24.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Tens Digit** = 2\n- **Ones Digit** = 4\n\nProduct: \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** 8\n\nIt finally makes sense! This looks correct given how I broke it down using the properties of numbers and reviewing steps when unsure.",

  "ground_truth": "Define the sequence $$x_i = \\text{the remainder when }2^i\\text{ is divided by 100}.$$  Then note that $x_{22} = x_2 = 4$, and thus this sequence repeats every 20 terms from $x_2$ onward.  The desired product is $2^{1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 99 + 100} = 2^{5050}$.  If we can find $x_{5050}$, we will then be done.  But since $5050 = 20\\cdot 252 + 10$, we see that $x_{5050} = x_{10} = 24$.  Thus our answer is $2\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{8}$."
