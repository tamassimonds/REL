    "working_out": "Let's dive into this problem by carefully analyzing the given situation. We are dealing with a rectangle and two quarter-circles within it, and we need to find the area of the non-shaded region.\n\nFirst, let's sketch out what I understand from the problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Shape Details:**\n   - We have a rectangle that measures \\(4\\) units by \\(8\\) units. \n   - Two quarter-circles are inside this rectangle. Each of these quarter-circles has a radius of \\(4\\) units. This makes sense because the quarters are supposed to fit perfectly within the dimensions of the rectangle.\n\n2. **Visualizing Placement of the Quarter-Circles:**\n   - Given their radius, it's clear these quarter-circles are positioned at one of the rectangle's corners, allowing a seamless fit.\n   - Since the rectangle is \\(8\\) units in width, one quarter-circle will sit in one corner (say the bottom-left), and the other in an adjacent corner (bottom-right).\n\n3. **Reassess My Approach:** \n   - Ah, wait, let's get a better mental picture. If each quarter-circle has a radius of 4, one will sit perfectly in the bottom-left section and overspill the top-left quadrant. Similarly, the other at the top-right will fill its adjacent corner too.\n   - The centers of these circles are at one endpoint of the rectangle's width-edge and halfway along its height-margin\u2014 looks sort of like an artist's corner!\n\n4. **Outline Calculation Strategy:**\n   - To determine the non-shaded area, we must find the area of the rectangle and then subtract the area occupied by these two quarter-circles.\n\n5. **Calculate the Area of the Rectangle:**\n   - The entire rectangle's area is \\(4 \\times 8 = 32\\) square units.\n\n6. **Calculating the Area of the Quarter-Circles:**\n   - Each circle would have an area of \\(\\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi\\). Therefore, a quarter-circle is \\(\\frac{16\\pi}{4} = 4\\pi\\).\n\n7. **Total Shaded Area:**\n   - Since we have two quarter-circles, the shaded area totals \\(2 \\times 4\\pi = 8\\pi\\).\n\n8. **Determine the Non-Shaded Area:**\n   - The non-shaded area is the rectangle area minus the shaded area: \n     \\[\n     32 - 8\\pi\n     \\]\n\n9. **Wrapping Up:**\n   - This does seem to align with the problem's requirement to express the non-shaded area in the form \\(a - b\\pi\\). Thus, \\(a = 32\\) and \\(b = 8\\), so our answer is:\n     \\[\n     \\boxed{32 - 8\\pi}\n     \\]\n\nReflecting on this, the deductions make sense given the constraints. Everything lines up, and all initial assumptions have held through the calculation approaches. If there's a need to verify, quick math checks on each piece can corroborate this result.",

  "ground_truth": "The two shaded regions combine to form a semicircle. The area of this semicircle is half the area of a circle with radius 4, or $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\pi\\cdot 4^2=8\\pi$. The area of the non-shaded region is equal to the area of the rectangle minus the area of the shaded region, or $8\\cdot4-8\\pi=\\boxed{32-8\\pi}$ square units."
