    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step:\n\n**First Impressions:**\nWhen I first see this question, I notice it involves a rational expression. My instinct is to simplify the fraction, but there's also a linear part outside of it. It reminds me of problems where simplification or factoring might be key. I'm curious if c can make the denominator zero, so I should be cautious of any restrictions.\n\n**Setting Up the Problem:**\nThe expression given is:\n\\[\n\\frac{c^2 + 6c - 27}{c-3} + 2c = 23\n\\]\n\nIt seems like the rational part, \\(\\frac{c^2 + 6c - 27}{c-3}\\), might be simplified by polynomial division or factoring.\n\n**Step 1: Checking the Denominator**\nFirst, I need to make sure \\(c-3\\) is not zero, because division by zero is undefined. So, \\(c \\neq 3\\). \n\n**Step 2: Simplifying the Rational Expression**\nNext, let's consider simplifying the numerator \\(c^2 + 6c - 27\\).\n\n**Brainstorming Factorization:**\nI wonder if this quadratic can be factored. I need factors of \\(-27\\) that add up to \\(6\\). The factor pairs of \\(-27\\) are:\n- (1, -27)\n- (-1, 27)\n- (3, -9)\n- (-3, 9)\n\nLet's try the pair \\(9\\) and \\(-3\\) since \\(9 - 3 = 6\\).\n\nOh! That seems promising:\n\\[\nc^2 + 6c - 27 = (c + 9)(c - 3)\n\\]\n\nThat means:\n\\[\n\\frac{c^2 + 6c - 27}{c-3} = \\frac{(c+9)(c-3)}{c-3}\n\\]\n\nAs long as \\(c \\neq 3\\), the \\(c-3\\) terms cancel out, and we are left with:\n\\[\nc+9\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplifying the Equation**\nSubstitute back into the equation, we now have:\n\\[\nc + 9 + 2c = 23\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n3c + 9 = 23\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\(9\\) from both sides:\n\\[\n3c = 14\n\\]\n\nDivide by \\(3\\) to solve for \\(c\\):\n\\[\nc = \\frac{14}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Checking My Solution:**\nLet's double-check if there's a larger value for \\(c\\). The only restriction I found was \\(c \\neq 3\\). \\(c = \\frac{14}{3}\\) is indeed larger than \\(3\\), satisfying this condition.\n\n**Verification:**\nSubstitute \\(c = \\frac{14}{3}\\) back into the simplified equation to ensure correctness:\n- Plug into the simplified equation:\n  - \\(3c + 9 = 3 \\times \\frac{14}{3} + 9 = 14 + 9 = 23\\), which matches the original equation's RHS.\n\nIt looks like everything checks out! No errors found.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe largest value of \\(c\\) that satisfies the given equation is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{14}{3}}\n\\]",
