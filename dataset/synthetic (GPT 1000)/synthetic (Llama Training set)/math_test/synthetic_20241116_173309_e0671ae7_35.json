  "problem": "On my ping-pong team there are four times as many right-handed boys as left-handed boys.  Of the students on the team who are left-handed, there are twice as many girls as there are boys.  Half of the girls who are on the team are left-handed.  If there are 36 people on the team, how many are right-handed boys? (Assume no player plays ping-pong equally well with both hands.)",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this step-by-step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Brainstorming\n\nThis problem involves understanding the team composition based on handedness and gender. What comes to mind first is setting up variables, as the problem gives relationships between different groups. This sounds like a classic algebra problem where you set up equations based on the relationships described. Here's what I'm initially thinking:\n\n1. **Right-Handed Boys (RB) vs Left-Handed Boys (LB):** There are four times as many right-handed boys as left-handed boys.  \n2. **Left-Handed Girls (LG) vs Left-Handed Boys (LB):** Twice as many girls are left-handed compared to boys.\n3. **Total Girls (G) Handiness:** Half of the girls are left-handed.\n4. **Overall People Count:** The total is 36 team members.\n\nThese relationships will guide me in setting up equations.\n\n### Step 1: Define Variables\n\nLet's define the variables clearly:\n\n- \\( RB \\) = Number of right-handed boys\n- \\( LB \\) = Number of left-handed boys\n- \\( LG \\) = Number of left-handed girls\n- \\( G \\) = Total number of girls on the team\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Relationships as Equations\n\n1. From \"there are four times as many right-handed boys as left-handed boys\":\n\n   \\[\n   RB = 4 \\times LB\n   \\]\n\n2. From \"twice as many girls are left-handed compared to boys\":\n\n   \\[\n   LG = 2 \\times LB\n   \\]\n\n3. From \"half of the girls are left-handed\":\n\n   \\[\n   LG = \\frac{G}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. The total number of people equation based on all left-handed and right-handed students:\n\n   \\[\n   RB + LB + LG + (G - LG) = 36\n   \\]\n\n    Simplifying this:\n    \n   \\[\n   RB + LB + G = 36\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Substitute and Solve\n\nLet's substitute the equation for \\( LG \\) into the equation \\( LG = \\frac{G}{2} \\).\n\n   \\[\n   2 \\times LB = \\frac{G}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying for \\( G \\), we have:\n\n   \\[\n   G = 4 \\times LB\n   \\]\n\nNow substitute \\( G = 4 \\times LB \\) and \\( RB = 4 \\times LB \\) in the simplified total people equation:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times LB + LB + 4 \\times LB = 36\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n9 \\times LB = 36\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( LB \\):\n\n\\[\nLB = \\frac{36}{9} = 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Find \\( RB \\), \\( LG \\), and \\( G \\)\n\nNow that we have \\( LB \\), let\u2019s find the others:\n\n- \\( RB = 4 \\times LB = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\)\n- \\( LG = 2 \\times LB = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\)\n- \\( G = 4 \\times LB = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\)\n\n### Step 5: Verification\n\nFinally, let's verify if all these add up to the total of 36 people:\n\n- Total left-handed people: \\( LB + LG = 4 + 8 = 12 \\)\n- Total right-handed people: We know \\( RB = 16 \\) and the remaining right-handed are girls:\n  - Remaining girls: \\( G - LG = 16 - 8 = 8 \\)\n  - Total right-handed girls = 8\n- Check: \\( RB + LB + LG + \\text{right-handed girls} = 16 + 4 + 8 + 8 = 36 \\)\n\nEverything checks out!\n\nThus, the number of right-handed boys is \\( 16 \\).\n\nThis problem involved setting up relationships, substituting them correctly, and checking our solutions to ensure they fit the constraints given. It was useful to redefine the equations after finding \\( G \\) to ensure consistency.",
