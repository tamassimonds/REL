    "working_out": "**Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, so we have the inequality \\(\\frac{1}{4} < \\frac{x}{7} < \\frac{1}{3}\\). It seems like we need to find integer values of \\(x\\) such that when divided by 7, the result is between 1/4 and 1/3. \n\nThis problem reminds me of other fractional inequalities, so maybe a good way to start is by getting rid of the fractions. Cross-multiplying can be useful if I want to simplify the inequalities into more manageable numbers. \n\nFirst, let's explore if simplifying the inequalities will help:\n\n- Starting with \\(\\frac{1}{4} < \\frac{x}{7}\\), we could multiply both sides by 7 to isolate \\(x\\).\n- Similarly, we should multiply the other inequality, \\(\\frac{x}{7} < \\frac{1}{3}\\), by 7.\n\nOkay, let's try to calculate these out and see if it gives any clearer guidance.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation for the First Inequality:**\n\n1. \\(\\frac{1}{4} < \\frac{x}{7} \\)  \n   Multiply both sides by 7:\n   \\[\n   7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} < x \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7}{4} < x\n   \\]\n   Evaluating \\(\\frac{7}{4}\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   1.75 < x\n   \\]\n   So \\(x\\) must be greater than 1.75. As \\(x\\) is an integer, \\(x \\geq 2\\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation for the Second Inequality:**\n\n2. \\(\\frac{x}{7} < \\frac{1}{3}\\)  \n   Multiply both sides by 7:\n   \\[\n   x < 7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x < \\frac{7}{3}\n   \\]\n   Evaluating \\(\\frac{7}{3}\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   x < 2.333\n   \\]\n   So \\(x\\) must be less than 2.333. As \\(x\\) is an integer, \\(x \\leq 2\\).\n\n**Combining Results:**\n\n- From the first calculation, we have \\(x \\geq 2\\).\n- From the second calculation, we have \\(x \\leq 2\\).\n\nClearly, the only integer that satisfies both \\(x \\geq 2\\) and \\(x \\leq 2\\) is \\(x = 2\\).\n\n**Reflect and Double-Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s check if \\(x = 2\\) satisfies the original inequality:\n\n- Substitute \\(x = 2\\) into \\(\\frac{x}{7}\\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2}{7}\n  \\]\n  It\u2019s helpful to approximate this:\n  \\[\n  \\approx 0.2857\n  \\]\n\n- Now, let\u2019s check the bounds:\n  - \\(\\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\\)\n  - \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333\\)\n\nSince \\(0.25 < 0.2857 < 0.3333\\), it confirms that \\(\\frac{1}{4} < \\frac{2}{7} < \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nYes, after double-checking, all calculations and logical checks agree that the integer \\(x = 2\\) satisfies the inequality \\(\\frac{1}{4} < \\frac{x}{7} < \\frac{1}{3}\\).",
