    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive in. Here's how I would think through solving this problem step by step, including my initial thoughts, reflections, and corrections along the way.\n\n### Initial Understanding\n\n**Problem Statement**: We need to find a number \\( x \\) that, when added to both the numerator and denominator of the fraction \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\), results in a fraction equivalent to 0.4.\n\nOkay, this seems like a problem where manipulating algebraically should help. I remember similar types of problems where balancing changes on both sides of a fraction impacts its value.\n\n### Brainstorming Approaches\n\n1. **Algebraic Setup**: This feels like a classic setup for an equation. If I denote the number to be added by \\( x \\), then the new fraction becomes \\(\\frac{5 + x}{8 + x}\\). This must equal 0.4.\n\n2. **Testing Small Values of \\( x \\)**: Initially, I consider choosing some small values for \\( x \\) to test out, but my instinct says to go with algebra first because it's more systematic.\n\n3. **Reflection**: Algebra is likely cleaner than trying random values, so let's proceed with this approach.\n\n### Solving Algebraically\n\n**Step 1**: Set up the equation from what we need:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5 + x}{8 + x} = 0.4\n\\]\n\n**Step 2**: Clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by \\( 8 + x \\):\n\n\\[\n5 + x = 0.4(8 + x)\n\\]\n\n**Step 3**: Distribute the 0.4 on the right:\n\n\\[\n5 + x = 3.2 + 0.4x\n\\]\n\n**Step 4**: Isolate \\( x \\) on one side. We can do this by moving all terms involving \\( x \\) to one side of the equation and constants to the other:\n\nSubtract \\( 0.4x \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n5 + x - 0.4x = 3.2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n5 + 0.6x = 3.2\n\\]\n\n**Step 5**: Subtract 5 from both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n0.6x = 3.2 - 5 = -1.8\n\\]\n\n**Step 6**: Divide by 0.6 to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-1.8}{0.6} = -3\n\\]\n\n### Checking the Solution\n\nOkay, before I get too confident, I should check if this solution makes sense.\n\n- Original fraction: \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)\n- Adding \\(-3\\) to the numerator and denominator gives \\(\\frac{5 - 3}{8 - 3} = \\frac{2}{5}\\).\n\nDoes \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) equal 0.4? \n\nCalculating \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\): \n\\[ \n2 \\div 5 = 0.4 \n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYes, \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) does equal 0.4, confirming that the solution \\( x = -3 \\) is correct.\n\nReflecting on the process, starting with an algebraic approach was fruitful and testing the solution reinforced its validity. The negative value for \\( x \\) makes sense because both the numerator and denominator of the fraction must decrease to achieve the desired lower value of the fraction. \n\nIn the chaotic storm of solving, the method holds true, showing the power of algebra in reaching correct solutions efficiently!",

  "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the desired the number, so adding the number to the numerator and denominator of $\\dfrac{5}{8}$ gives $\\dfrac{5+n}{8+n}$, and we must have $$\\dfrac{5+n}{8+n} = 0.4.$$  Writing $0.4$ as a fraction, we have $$\\dfrac{5+n}{8+n} = \\dfrac{2}{5}.$$Multiplying both sides by $8+n$ and by 5 gives $$5(5+n) = 2(8+n).$$Expanding both sides gives$$25+5n = 16 + 2n.$$Subtracting 25 and $2n$ from both sides gives $3n=-9$, so $n=\\boxed{-3}.$"
