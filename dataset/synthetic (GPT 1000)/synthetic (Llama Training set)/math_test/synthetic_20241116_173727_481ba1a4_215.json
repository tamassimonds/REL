    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem from the ground up, taking it step by step and showcasing my thought process throughout.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- When I first looked at this question, my mind immediately went to the properties of regular polygons. An equilateral triangle is a regular polygon with three equal sides and three equal interior angles. Similarly, a square is a regular polygon but with four sides.\n  \n- I remember from geometry that the interior angles of regular polygons have specific formulas. This problem might be familiar territory, even though I'm not yet sure how to express the ratio. \n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Interior Angles**\n\n- **Equilateral Triangle:** An equilateral triangle has three equal interior angles. Since the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, each interior angle of an equilateral triangle must be \\(180^\\circ / 3 = 60^\\circ\\).\n\n- **Square:** A square is a regular quadrilateral with four equal interior angles. The sum of the interior angles in any quadrilateral is 360 degrees, therefore each angle in a square must be \\(360^\\circ / 4 = 90^\\circ\\).\n\n**Step 2: Formulating a Strategy**\n\n- Now that I know each angle's measures, I need to find the ratio of one interior angle of the equilateral triangle to one interior angle of the square. \n\n- This can be expressed as the ratio of 60 degrees to 90 degrees.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Ratio**\n\n- The ratio can be simplified. Let\u2019s consider the fraction \\( \\frac{60}{90} \\).\n\n- I notice that both 60 and 90 are divisible by 30. Quick checks on divisibility confirm that:\n  - \\( \\frac{60}{30} = 2 \\)\n  - \\( \\frac{90}{30} = 3 \\)\n\n- Therefore, \\( \\frac{60}{90} \\) simplifies to \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n**Step 4: Verification and Reflection**\n\n- Let me think about this: Given what I know about triangles and squares, \\( 60^\\circ \\) seemed correct for the equilateral triangle, and \\( 90^\\circ \\) made sense for the square as well.\n  \n- I\u2019ll do a quick double-check: Reduce \\( \\frac{60}{90} \\) by division. Indeed, 30 is the greatest common divisor here, so \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) is right.\n\n**Step 5: Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n- All checks confirm that the ratio of one interior angle of an equilateral triangle to one interior angle of a square is indeed \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n- Conceptually, this problem was straightforward once the properties of an equilateral triangle and a square were outlined clearly. Reflecting on it, I see that understanding the basic properties and sum of the interior angles was pivotal.\n\nIn conclusion, the ratio of one interior angle of an equilateral triangle to one interior angle of a square is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}\\).",
