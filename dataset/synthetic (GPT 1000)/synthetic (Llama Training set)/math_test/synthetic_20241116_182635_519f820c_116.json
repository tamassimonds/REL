    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n**Understanding the Question:**\n\nThe task is to find the smallest three-digit positive integer that is congruent to 1 (mod 7). \n\n- A number being congruent to 1 (mod 7) means when you divide the number by 7, the remainder is 1.\n- A three-digit positive integer ranges from 100 to 999.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Initially, I'm thinking of starting at the lowest three-digit number, 100, and checking until I find the first number that satisfies the condition. This is a straightforward approach but might involve a bit of manual checking.\n- An alternative thought that pops into my head is to exploit some pattern recognition. If I start with 100 and keep adding 7 each time, I could land exactly on the required number.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by exploring directly:\n\n**Strategy 1: Direct Checking**\n\n1. **Step 1:** Start with 100. Check if 100 mod 7 equals 1.  \n   - Calculate \\(100 \\div 7\\) which gives a quotient of 14 and a remainder of 2.\n   - So, 100 is not congruent to 1 (mod 7).\n\n2. **Step 2:** Try the next number, 101.  \n   - Calculate \\(101 \\div 7\\) which gives a quotient of 14 and a remainder of 3.\n   - Not good.\n\n3. **Step 3:** Try 102.  \n   - Calculate \\(102 \\div 7\\) which gives a quotient of 14 and a remainder of 4.\n   - Still not congruent to 1 (mod 7).\n\n4. **Step 4:** Proceed with 103.  \n   - Calculate \\(103 \\div 7\\) which gives a quotient of 14 and a remainder of 5.\n   - Nope.\n\n5. **Step 5:** Try 104.  \n   - Calculate \\(104 \\div 7\\) which provides a quotient of 14 and a remainder of 6.\n   - Not valid.\n\n6. **Step 6:** Try 105.  \n   - Calculate \\(105 \\div 7\\) which provides a quotient of 15 and a remainder of 0.\n   - Oh, so close but not quite.\n\n7. **Step 7:** Finally, try 106.  \n   - Calculate \\(106 \\div 7\\) which gives a quotient of 15 and a remainder of 1.\n   - We've found it! 106 is the answer.\n\n**Reflecting on the Method:**\n\nThis method worked but involved a bit of brute-force checking until we found the correct number. \n\n- There's an \"aha!\" moment here: If we noticed that starting from a remainder of 0 at 105, just adding 1 more will drop us into a remainder of 1, it would align perfectly with our requirement.\n- Essentially, understanding the mod cycle helped cut down unnecessary steps, but checking it practically ensured accuracy.\n\nIn conclusion, the simplest realization is that 106 is the smallest three-digit positive integer congruent to 1 (mod 7). \n\nI\u2019m satisfied with this only after reinforcing that the understanding of mod cycles didn\u2019t lead me astray. It\u2019s useful to see both methods to verify.\n\nAlright, feeling confident about the solution!",

  "ground_truth": "We divide 100 by 7 to obtain a quotient of 14 and a remainder 2. Since 100 is congruent to 2 (mod 7), we find that 99 is congruent to 1 (mod 7). Thus the next integer congruent to 1 (mod 7) is $99 + 7 = \\boxed{106}$."
