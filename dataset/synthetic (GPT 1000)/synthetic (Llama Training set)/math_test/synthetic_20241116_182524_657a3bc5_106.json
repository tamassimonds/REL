    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem methodically. At first glance, this problem looks like it's asking for proportional representation. The 7th and 8th grades have a combined total of 18 student representatives, and we want to allocate them fairly based on enrollment numbers.\n\nInitial thoughts: \n- This seems like a classic proportional distribution problem. The idea is to divide the representatives in such a way that reflects the number of students in each grade fairly. \n- I\u2019ve done something similar with apportionment or when dividing budget amounts proportionally. \n- Okay, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Numbers Involved**\n- 7th grade enrollment: 520 students\n- 8th grade enrollment: 650 students\n- Total students in both grades = 520 + 650 = 1170 students\n- Total representatives = 18\n\n**Step 2: Find Proportions of Each Grade**\n- For proportional distribution, each grade should get a number of representatives based on its share of the total student population.\n  \n**Step 3: Calculate Proportion of Each Grade**\n- Proportion of 7th grade: \\( \\frac{520}{1170} \\)\n- Proportion of 8th grade: \\( \\frac{650}{1170} \\)\n\n**Step 4: Allocate Representatives Based on These Proportions**\n- Representatives for 7th grade: \\( \\frac{520}{1170} \\times 18 \\)\n- Representatives for 8th grade: \\( \\frac{650}{1170} \\times 18 \\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Let's calculate these:\n  - For 7th grade: \\( \\frac{520}{1170} \\times 18 \\approx 8.0 \\)\n  - For 8th grade: \\( \\frac{650}{1170} \\times 18 \\approx 10.0 \\)\n\nChecking my steps:\n- Total representatives calculated: \\( 8 + 10 = 18 \\), which adds up to the total we have. So far, so good.\n- This suggests the distribution is indeed 8 representatives for 7th grade and 10 representatives for 8th grade.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIt looks like the 8th grade should have 10 representatives for fair representation based on enrollment. This makes sense because the 8th grade has more students, so it should have more representatives. This method reflects the student distribution proportionately.\n\nReflecting:\n- The approach seems correct, checked calculations, relevant details considered.\n- I initially thought it might be more complex, but it turned out to be a straightforward proportional distribution problem. \n- It's key to reflect on whether a simpler method could have been overlooked, but in this case, proportional allocation is the most direct method.\n\nThere we have it. Ten representatives for the 8th grade should ensure fair representation based on the enrollment numbers.",

  "ground_truth": "The 8th grade has $\\frac{650}{520+650} = \\frac{650}{1170} = \\frac{65}{117}$ of the total students. To simplify this fraction further, we notice that $65 = 5 \\cdot 13$. Since $117$ is not divisible by $5$, we test if it's divisible by $13$ and find that $117 = 9 \\cdot 13$. Thus to have fair representation, the 8th grade should have $\\frac{65}{117} \\times 18 = \\frac{5}{9} \\times 18 = \\boxed{10}$ of the $18$ representatives."
