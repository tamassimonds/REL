    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. \n\n**Initial Thoughts and Brainstorming:**\n\nLooking at the problem, we're working with a triangle formed by a line, the x-axis, and a vertical line \\(x = k\\). Immediately, I think of previous problems where calculating the area of a triangle involved using geometry.\n\nThe line given is \\(y = \\frac{2}{3}x + 5\\), so it's linear and increasing. The x-axis is \\(y = 0\\), creating a natural intersection at some x-value where these meet.\n\nThe vertical line \\(x = k\\) will form a vertical boundary, creating a right triangle I suspect. I need to think about how each piece fits together in the coordinate plane.\n\nReflecting on this setup, I think finding the intercepts of the line with the x-axis and the specified line \\(x = k\\) will form two points of interest.\n\n**Plan Outline:** \n\n1. Determine where the line \\(y = \\frac{2}{3}x + 5\\) intersects with the x-axis.\n2. Determine where this line meets the vertical line \\(x = k\\).\n3. Use these intersections to compute the base and height of the triangle.\n4. Calculate the area of the triangle and ensure it is less than 20.\n5. Find the integral values of \\(k\\) that satisfy this condition.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Find the intercept with the x-axis:**\n\n   The x-axis is represented by \\(y = 0\\).\n   \n   Setting \\(0 = \\frac{2}{3}x + 5\\), solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3}x = -5 \\implies x = -\\frac{15}{2}\n   \\]\n   So, the line intersects the x-axis at \\((-7.5, 0)\\).\n\n2. **Find the point of intersection with \\(x = k\\):**\n\n   On the line \\(x = k\\), substitute \\(x = k\\) into \\(y = \\frac{2}{3}x + 5\\):\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{2}{3}k + 5\n   \\]\n   Hence, the intersection is \\((k, \\frac{2}{3}k + 5)\\).\n\n3. **Determine the base and height:**\n\n   The base of the triangle is the distance along the x-axis from \\((-7.5, 0)\\) to \\((k, 0)\\).\n   So, the base = \\(k + 7.5\\).\n\n   The height is the y-coordinate of point \\((k, \\frac{2}{3}k + 5)\\), which is \\(\\frac{2}{3}k + 5\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the area and solve the inequality:**\n\n   The area \\(A\\) of a triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\).\n\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (k + 7.5) \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}k + 5\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   This must satisfy \\(A < 20\\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times (k + 7.5) \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}k + 5\\right) < 20\n   \\]\n\n   Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction:\n\n   \\[\n   (k + 7.5) \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}k + 5\\right) < 40\n   \\]\n\n   Expanding:\n   \n   \\[\n   (k + 7.5)(\\frac{2}{3}k + 5) = \\frac{2}{3}k^2 + 5k + 5k + 37.5\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplifying:\n   \n   \\[\n   = \\frac{2}{3}k^2 + 10k + 37.5 < 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3}k^2 + 10k + 37.5 < 40\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3}k^2 + 10k - 2.5 < 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve the quadratic inequality:**\n\n   Multiply the entire expression by 3 to eliminate the fractions:\n   \n   \\[\n   2k^2 + 30k - 7.5 < 0\n   \\]\n\n   Actually, rounding to an equation to find critical points:\n   \n   \\[\n   2k^2 + 30k - 7.5 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   Solving with the quadratic formula:\n   \n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-30 \\pm \\sqrt{30^2 - 4 \\times 2 \\times (-7.5)}}{4}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{-30 \\pm \\sqrt{900 + 60}}{4}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{-30 \\pm \\sqrt{960}}{4}\n   \\]\n\n   Approximate:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{960} \\approx 31 \\rightarrow k = \\frac{-30 \\pm 31}{4}\n   \\]\n\n   Roots:\n   \n   \\[\n   k_1 \\approx \\frac{1}{4}, \\quad k_2 \\approx \\frac{-61}{4}\n   \\]\n\n   Now let's evaluate the valid integer range:\n   \n   \\( -15.25 < k < 0.25\\).\n\n6. **Sum of integer values:**\n\n   Integer values in that range are \\(-15, -14, ..., 0\\).\n\n   Use sum formula for an arithmetic sequence where \\(n = 16\\) terms:\n   \n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l) = 8(-15 + 0)\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   S = 8 \\times (-15) = -120\n   \\]\n\n**Conclusion and Final Check:**\n\nIt seems logical; the inequalities hold and integer summation is typical. Hence, the sum of all possible integer values of \\(k\\) where the area is less than 20 is \\(-120\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since two of the lines that are the edges of the triangle are known, their intersection must be one of the vertices of the triangle. So we have $y=0$ (the $x$-axis) and $y=\\frac{2}{3}x+5$. Solving this equation, we find $0=\\frac{2}{3}x+5$, or $-5=\\frac{2}{3}x$, so $x=-\\frac{15}{2}$. Thus one of the vertices of the triangle is $\\left(-\\frac{15}{2},0\\right)$. The other vertices lie on the line $x=k$, so they take the form $(k,0)$ and $\\left(k,\\frac{2}{3}k+5\\right)$. The area of the triangle can be expressed as $\\frac{1}{2}bh$. The height is $\\frac{2}{3}k+5$, since the base is along the $x$-axis, and the base is $k-\\left(-\\frac{15}{2}\\right)=k+\\frac{15}{2}$. Thus the area is $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}k+5\\right)\\left(k+\\frac{15}{2}\\right)$.\n\nUp until this point we've mostly ignored the possibility of having a triangle below the $x$-axis, with $k<-\\frac{15}{2}$. This is possible, but our formula for the area will still work. If $k<-\\frac{15}{2}$, then $k+\\frac{15}{2}$ will be negative. But the line $y=\\frac{2}{3}x+5$ will be below the $x$-axis so the value $\\frac{2}{3}k+5$ will be negative as well. Half their product, the area, will thus be positive as desired. So we have  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}k+5\\right)\\left(k+\\frac{15}{2}\\right)&<20\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n\\left(\\frac{2}{3}k+5\\right)\\left(k+\\frac{15}{2}\\right)&<40\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n\\frac{2}{3}k^2+10k+\\frac{75}{2}&<40\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n\\frac{2}{3}k^2+10k-\\frac{5}{2}&<0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n4k^2+60k-15&<0.\n\\end{align*}We must solve this quadratic inequality. The roots of the quadratic are $$\\frac{-(60)\\pm\\sqrt{(60)^2-4(4)(-15)}}{2(4)}=\\frac{-60\\pm\\sqrt{3840}}{8}=-\\frac{15}{2}\\pm2\\sqrt{15}.$$Testing, we find that the value of the quadratic is negative between the roots, or $4k^2+60k-15<0$ whenever $-\\frac{15}{2}-2\\sqrt{15}<k<-\\frac{15}{2}+2\\sqrt{15}$. The decimal approximations of the roots are $-15.25\\ldots$ and $0.25\\ldots$, respectively, so we have $-15.25<k<0.25$. Since we are interested in values of $k$ for which $k$ is an integer, we have $-15\\le k\\le 0$. The problem asks for the sum of all integral values of $k$, so we must sum the integers from $-15$ to $0$. We can compute this with the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S=\\frac{(-15+0)(16)}{2}=\\boxed{-120}$."
