    "working_out": "Alright, let's start thinking about this problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts: We have a test consisting of ten true-false statements. Out of these, four statements are supposed to be true, and six are false. My goal is to determine the number of distinct answer keys possible.\n\nHmmm, this seems like a combinatorics problem because it deals with different ways to arrange items. The core of the problem seems to rely on deciding which of the ten statements are true and which are false.\n\n- **Possibility Check:** Are they saying there's a specific number of true and false statements that must exactly align with four true and six false? Yes, it appears that way.\n\n**Step 2: Possible Strategies**\n\n1. **Combinatorial Approach:** The number of ways to select 4 true statements out of 10 is a classic combinations problem.\n\n2. **Permutation Approach:** Initially thought of permutations, but wait, the order of selecting true or false statements within the key doesn\u2019t seem to matter. Each unique set of true/false assignments is enough.\n\n3. **Listing Approach:** But listing all combinations of four true statements among ten seems inefficient and prone to errors.\n\nGiven these strategies, the combinatorial approach seems most suitable here, as we're just picking positions for the true statements out of a total list. Let's pursue this one.\n\n**Step 3: Develop the Equation**\n\nThe key here is using combinations because order does not matter. We can express this as a combination: \n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of possible answer keys} = \\binom{10}{4}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- 10 is the total number of statements.\n- 4 is the number of statements I'd label as true.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate**\n\nLet's calculate \\(\\binom{10}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{4} = \\frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n- The numerator: \\(10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 5040\\)\n- The denominator: \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5040}{24} = 210\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Check and Reflect**\n\n- **Does the number make sense?** Yes, it feels reasonable that we have 210 distinct combinations. If we were to visualize picking any four statements out of ten, counting how different sets contribute to unique combinations, 210 checks out.\n  \n- **Re-evaluate the strategy:** No obvious dead ends or mistakes. The combinations approach holds because we're concerning ourselves with subsets and not permutations.\n\n- **Think about similar problems:** This structure reminds me of basic binomial distribution problems where selection without order is involved. Seems on track.\n\nIn conclusion, the number of distinct answer keys possible for this test is **210**. This approach feels sound, and the logic aligns with typical combinatorial techniques.\n\nWhew, that seems solid! If there were anyone else answering, now would be the time to confirm my calculation or for a different approach \u2013 but for now, I\u2019m confident in the result.",
