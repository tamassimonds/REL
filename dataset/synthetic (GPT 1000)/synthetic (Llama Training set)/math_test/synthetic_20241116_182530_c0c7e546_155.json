    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We have a parallelogram with a ratio of two interior angles given as 4:5. Our goal is to find the degree measure of one of the obtuse angles.\n\n---\n\nFirst Thoughts: \n\nWhen I first see this problem, it reminds me of properties of parallelograms that I've learned before. I know that in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary (i.e., they add up to 180 degrees). \n\nHmm, with the given ratio, it feels like we're dealing with consecutive angles here. If their ratio is 4:5, they should add up to 180 degrees. This situation definitely seems manageable.\n\n---\n\nStep 1: Set Up the Equation\n\nLet's denote the smaller angle as \\(4x\\) (since 4 is the smaller number in the ratio given), and the larger angle as \\(5x\\). My thinking is that since these two angles are consecutive, their sum will be 180 degrees due to the supplementary nature in parallelograms.\n\nSo I can establish the equation: \n\n\\[ 4x + 5x = 180 \\]\n\nSimplifying this gives:\n\n\\[ 9x = 180 \\]\n\n---\n\nStep 2: Solve for \\(x\\)\n\nOkay, to solve for \\(x\\), I can divide both sides of the equation by 9.\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{180}{9} = 20 \\]\n\nNow that I have \\(x = 20\\), I can find the measures of the angles themselves by substituting back.\n\n---\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Angles\n\nThe smaller angle, which I initially set as \\(4x\\), would be:\n\n\\[ 4x = 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\text{ degrees} \\]\n\nThe larger angle, \\(5x\\), would be:\n\n\\[ 5x = 5 \\times 20 = 100 \\text{ degrees} \\]\n\n---\n\nCheck \u2018Aha!\u2019 Moment:\n\nAlright, so the angles I computed are 80 degrees and 100 degrees. Now, an important realization hits me \u2013 these are consecutive angles. Therefore, the obtuse angles (greater than 90 degrees) would both be equal to the larger angle, 100 degrees, since opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal.\n\nIt feels right to conclude that one of the obtuse angles of the parallelogram is 100 degrees.\n\n---\n\nFinal Check:\n\nLet's think about this setup again. In a parallelogram, if two consecutive angles \\(80^\\circ\\) and \\(100^\\circ\\) add up to \\(180^\\circ\\), then yes, this confirms the supplementary condition. Also, the opposite pairs \\(80^\\circ\\) and \\(100^\\circ\\) match up correctly as stated by the properties of parallelograms.\n\n---\n\nReflection:\n\nThis approach worked well. I feel confident because the problem's requirements align with the properties of parallelograms that I used throughout the solution. The systematic check of each assumption, from ratio to supplementary conditions, really held up. \n\nConclusion: The degree measure of one of the obtuse angles of the parallelogram is indeed 100 degrees.",

  "ground_truth": "If the measures of these two interior angles are $x$ and $y$, then $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{4}{5}$ and therefore $5x=4y$. We also know that $x+y=180$, so therefore $4x+4y=720$, $9x=720$, and $x=80$. Therefore, $y = \\frac{5}{4} \\times 80 = \\boxed{100^\\circ}$."
