  "problem": "A blue plane, a red plane and a white plane are waiting to take off from an airport that has two runways. Planes must take off from the airport one at a time, but can take off from either runway. In how many ways can the three takeoffs be scheduled? (One such way is the blue plane on runway A, followed by the red plane on runway B, followed by the white plane on runway B.)",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem of scheduling the takeoffs for the three airplanes on two runways. I'll start by really trying to understand what the problem is asking and brainstorm how we can approach it.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have three planes: blue, red, and white.\n   - There are two runways: let's call them A and B.\n   - Only one plane can take off at a time, but it can do so from either runway.\n   - We need to figure out how many different ways the sequence of takeoffs can happen.\n\n2. **Immediate Ideas:**\n   - Initially, this feels a bit like some combinations or permutations problem since the order seems to matter.\n   - Each plane has a choice of two runways, which complicates things compared to simply arranging them in a line.\n\n3. **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n   - Consider the three planes as slots that need to be filled. For each slot (takeoff), a plane can use one of two runways.\n   - There are combinations of the order of planes and for each order, variations with the runways.\n   - Another method might be fixing one plane's position first and seeing what happens for the others.\n\n---\n\n**Approach 1: Permutation with Choices**\n\n- Let's start by thinking if we treat it as a permutation problem with additional choices:\n  - First, find the order of planes: There are 3 planes, so \\(3!\\) (which is \\(6\\)) ways to order them.\n  - After deciding an order, each plane has 2 choices (either use runway A or B).\n\n- **Calculations:**\n  - For each ordering (6 in total), every plane has 2 runway options.\n  - Therefore, total ways \\(= 6 \\times (2 \\times 2 \\times 2) = 6 \\times 8 = 48\\).\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - This approach feels reasonable because we're considering both permutations and individual runway choices.\n  - 48 sounds like a manageable number given the constraints.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Approach seems correct since it logically covers permutations and runway choices.\n- Nothing seems off; using basic combinatorics here makes sense.\n  \n**Approach 2: Brute Force Verification**\n\n- Just to double-check (or for small problems like this, sometimes verifying by thinking through actual sequences can help):\n  - Fix one plane to take off first, say Blue. That takes up the first slot.\n  - Then, determine for the remaining two (say Red and White), how they can be ordered and which runways they choose.\n  - Verify this logic for other starting planes to see if the counts still add up to 48.\n\n---\n\n**Aha Moment:**\n- Okay, I\u2019m realizing that this is holding up well since it matches both intuitive brute-force sanity check and combinatoric calculation.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n- There are 48 different ways to schedule the takeoffs of the three planes from the two runways.\n\nThis method helps keep track of permutations and choices cleanly, and chaotic brainstorming at the start ensured we laid out a clear path with checks along the way.",

  "ground_truth": "There are 3 ways to choose the first plane and 2 ways to choose where it takes off. Similarly, there are 2 ways to choose the second plane after the first has taken off and 2 ways to choose where it takes off, as well as 1 way to choose the last plane and 2 ways to choose its runway. These multiply to a total of $3\\cdot2\\cdot2\\cdot2\\cdot1\\cdot2=3\\cdot2^4=\\boxed{48}$."
