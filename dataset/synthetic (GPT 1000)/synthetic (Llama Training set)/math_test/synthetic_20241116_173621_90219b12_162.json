    "working_out": "Let's dive into understanding the problem by dissecting the diagram and gathering the information we've been given:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - We have triangle \\( \\triangle PQR \\) with points labeled \\( P \\), \\( Q \\), and \\( R \\).\n   - The diagram mentions three segments: \\( PR = 28 \\), \\( PQ = 15 \\), and the base is broken down into two segments, \\( PL = 8 \\) and \\( LR = 20 \\) (since \\( PL + LR = PR = 28 \\)).\n   - We need to calculate the perimeter of the triangle.\n\n2. **Initial Thoughts**:\n   - The immediate thought would be to add up the lengths of \\( PQ \\), \\( QR \\), and \\( PR \\).\n   - However, only \\( PR \\) is fully stated as 28. We only have part of the information for \\( QR \\).\n   - The length \\( 25 \\) appears between the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the vertical line from \\( Q \\) to base. This line is indeed \\( QR \\) suggesting it might be related to this segment.\n\n3. **Sketching the Right Triangle**:\n   - Looking at the diagram, the segment from \\( Q \\) to the base, forming a perpendicular drop in resemblance to a height, indicates a right triangle scenario.\n   - This means \\( \\triangle QLR \\) is a right triangle with base \\( LR = 20 \\), height \\( LQ = \\text{vertical distance we need to establish}\\), and hypotenuse \\( QR \\).\n\n4. **Pythagorean Theorem Application**:\n   - Recognizing \\( \\triangle QLR \\) as right-angled with \\( QR \\) as hypotenuse:\n   \\[\n   LQ^2 + LR^2 = QR^2\n   \\]\n   - Substituting the known values (hypotenuse \\( 25 \\) and base \\( 20 \\)):\n   \\[\n   LQ^2 + 20^2 = 25^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   LQ^2 + 400 = 625\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   LQ^2 = 225\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   LQ = 15\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating for Perimeter**:\n   - Now the lengths of \\( PQ \\), \\( QR \\), and \\( PR \\) are:\n     - \\( PQ = 15 \\)\n     - \\( QR = 25 \\)\n     - \\( PR = 28 \\)\n   - Summing these gives the perimeter:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of } \\triangle PQR = PQ + QR + PR = 15 + 25 + 28 = 68\n   \\]\n\n6. **Checking the Work**:\n   - Reviewing each step confirms all align logically, from understanding what each label represents in the diagram, to properly applying the Pythagorean Theorem, and successfully calculating the perimeter.\n\nThus, the perimeter of \\( \\triangle PQR \\) is \\(\\boxed{68}\\). This process was methodical, relied on geometry principles especially around right triangles, and adhered to the information we had.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous approach. Let's revisit the problem and consider alternative strategies to find the correct perimeter of \\(\\triangle PQR\\).\n\n1. **Re-examining the Problem:**\n   - We have a triangle \\(\\triangle PQR\\) with sides \\(PR = 28\\), \\(PQ\\) and \\(QR\\), where we calculated \\(QR = 25\\) using a right triangle formed in the diagram.\n   - My previous calculation for \\(PQ\\) was incorrect. Let's examine the scenario again.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Diagram Again:**\n   - We noticed that \\(Q\\) is vertically above the base \\(PR\\) and connected through \\(S\\), the foot of the perpendicular from \\(Q\\) to the base \\(PR\\).\n   - The segments are \\(SR = 20\\) and \\(PS = 8\\), satisfying \\(PS + SR = 28\\).\n\n3. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem Again:**\n   - **In \\(\\triangle RSQ\\):**\n     - Known values: \\(SR = 20\\) and \\(QR = 25\\).\n     - We confirmed earlier \\(QS = 15\\) by:\n     \\[\n     QS^2 = QR^2 - SR^2 = 25^2 - 20^2 = 625 - 400 = 225 \\implies QS = \\sqrt{225} = 15\n     \\]\n\n   - **In \\(\\triangle PSQ\\):**\n     - Known values: \\(PS = 8\\) and \\(QS = 15\\).\n     - Let's correctly calculate \\(PQ\\):\n     \\[\n     PQ^2 = PS^2 + QS^2 = 8^2 + 15^2 = 64 + 225 = 289 \\implies PQ = \\sqrt{289} = 17\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Perimeter Again Correctly:**\n   - Now we have the side lengths:\n     - \\(PQ = 17\\)\n     - \\(QR = 25\\)\n     - \\(PR = 28\\)\n   - Thus, the perimeter of \\(\\triangle PQR\\) is:\n   \\[\n   PQ + QR + PR = 17 + 25 + 28 = 70\n   \\]\n\n5. **Reflecting on the Solution:**\n   - By re-evaluating each triangle and using the Pythagorean Theorem, I've confirmed this approach logically leads us to the correct perimeter of \\(\\triangle PQR\\).\n   - Reflecting on this process helps improve understanding and confirms our logical steps were ultimately aligned with the principles of geometry.\n\nTherefore, the correct perimeter of \\(\\triangle PQR\\) is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous approach. Let's revisit the problem and consider alternative strategies to find the correct perimeter of \\(\\triangle PQR\\).\n\n### Re-evaluating the Problem\n\n1. **Re-examining the Diagram and Initial Information:**\n   - We need to calculate the perimeter of \\(\\triangle PQR\\) with points \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(R\\).\n   - From the diagram, \\(PR = 28\\), and \\(QR\\) is given as 25.\n   - The base \\(PR\\) is divided into \\(PS = 8\\) and \\(SR = 20\\).\n\n### Brainstorming Alternative Strategies\n\n2. **Revisiting the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   - Initially, I mistakenly calculated \\(PQ\\) as 15. Let's re-evaluate the situation:\n   - Since \\(QR = 25\\) and \\(SR = 20\\), we already confirmed that \\(QS = 15\\).\n\n3. **Checking the Segment \\(PQ\\):**\n   - I need to focus on the correct calculation for the segment \\(PQ\\).\n   - Use \\(\\triangle PSQ\\), which is right-angled at \\(S\\), to find \\(PQ\\):\n   \\[\n   PQ^2 = PS^2 + QS^2 = 8^2 + 15^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   PQ^2 = 64 + 225 = 289\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   PQ = \\sqrt{289} = 17\n   \\]\n\n### Calculating the Correct Perimeter\n\n4. **Summing Up the Correct Side Lengths:**\n   - Now, with the correct values:\n     - \\(PQ = 17\\)\n     - \\(QR = 25\\)\n     - \\(PR = 28\\)\n\n5. **Final Perimeter Calculation:**\n   - Add up these corrected side lengths for the perimeter of \\(\\triangle PQR\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter} = PQ + QR + PR = 17 + 25 + 28 = 70\n   \\]\n\n### Reflection\n\n6. **Reflecting on the Solution:**\n   - By revisiting and applying geometry principles, I confirmed the correct side lengths.\n   - This revised approach aligns logically with the problem requirements and verifies our understanding of the scenario.\n\nThus, the correct perimeter of \\(\\triangle PQR\\) is \\(\\boxed{70}\\).",
