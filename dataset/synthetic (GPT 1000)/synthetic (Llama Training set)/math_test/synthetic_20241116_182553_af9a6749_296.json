    "working_out": "Alright, let's start by addressing the question: finding \\(\\frac{25}{3} \\cdot \\frac{27}{300}\\). \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nAt first glance, this problem requires multiplying two fractions. I recall that when multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. My initial thought is to apply this straightforward method, but I also wonder if simplification beforehand might make calculations easier.\n\n### Brainstorming\n\n**Strategy 1: Direct Multiplication**\n- Simply multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators and then simplify the result.\n\n**Strategy 2: Simplification Before Multiplication**\n- Look to simplify each fraction or perhaps even diagonally cancel common factors before performing the multiplication. \n\nReflecting on these strategies, simplifying before multiplying often saves time and reduces the chance of errors.\n\n### Choosing a Strategy\n\nI'll start with Strategy 2 because I suspect it might be simpler to handle and result in smaller numbers. That way, I can avoid multiplying large numbers and then needing to simplify a larger fraction at the end.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution\n\n**Step 1: Simplify Each Fraction**\n\n- Let's see what we can do with \\(\\frac{25}{3}\\). Here, 25 and 3 don\u2019t have any common factors, so it remains as is.\n\n- Now for \\(\\frac{27}{300}\\). \n  - Notice that both 27 and 300 can be divided by 3:\n    - Divide the numerator (27) by 3: \\(27 \\div 3 = 9\\)\n    - Divide the denominator (300) by 3: \\(300 \\div 3 = 100\\)\n  - So, \\(\\frac{27}{300}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{9}{100}\\).\n\n**Step 2: Multiply the Fractions**\n\nNow with simplified fractions, let's multiply:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{25}{3} \\times \\frac{9}{100} = \\frac{25 \\times 9}{3 \\times 100}\n\\]\n\nPerform the multiplications:\n\n- Numerator: \\(25 \\times 9 = 225\\)\n- Denominator: \\(3 \\times 100 = 300\\)\n\nSo, our fraction now is \\(\\frac{225}{300}\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Result**\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{225}{300}\\), I\u2019ll look for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator:\n\n- 225 can be divided by 75: \\(225 \\div 75 = 3\\)\n- 300 can also be divided by 75: \\(300 \\div 75 = 4\\)\n\nThus, \\(\\frac{225}{300}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's quickly verify:\n- The GCD of 225 and 300 is indeed 75, as calculated.\n- \\(\\frac{225}{300} = \\frac{3}{4}\\) is correct when reduced.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThe strategy of simplifying before multiplying paid off. It made the numbers manageable, and the outcome was straightforward to verify. It's comforting to see that the simplified steps yield the correct, expected result. This approach saved time and potential errors in handling unnecessarily large numbers.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "$\\frac{25}{3} \\cdot \\frac{27}{300} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 27}{3 \\cdot 300}$.  Since $300 = 3 \\cdot 100$, we can rewrite the expression as $\\frac{25 \\cdot 27}{3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 100}$; then, we can combine $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ for the expression $\\frac{25 \\cdot 27}{100 \\cdot 9}$.  Splitting this into the multiplication of two fractions yields $\\frac{25}{100} \\cdot \\frac{27}{9}$, which can be simplified to $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{1} =$ $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$."
