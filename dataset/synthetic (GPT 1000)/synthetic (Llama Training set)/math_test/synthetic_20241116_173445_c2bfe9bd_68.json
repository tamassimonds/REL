    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We've got a scenario with a chess club, and there's some math involved with how often they play against each other. First, I'll break down what we're given and what we need to find.\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\n- There are 10 members in the chess club.\n- They play a total of 900 games during the practice matches.\n- Each member plays against every other member \\(N\\) times.\n- We need to find the value of \\(N\\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts**\n\nThis seems like a combinatorics problem to me. From experience, problems involving pairs often relate to combinations, specifically choosing 2 people out of the 10. My gut tells me to think about how many unique pairs of players there are.\n\n**Exploratory Strategy**\n\n1. **Combination Insight**\n   - Let's start by thinking about how many unique pairs we can form from the 10 players. Each pair would represent a match-up in the chess club.\n   - Using combinations, the number of unique pairs (or matches between different members) is given by \\(\\binom{10}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Combinations**\n   - \\(\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45\\)\n   - So there are 45 unique matches between all members.\n\n3. **Relate to Total Games Played**\n   - Each pair plays each other \\(N\\) times. This means there are \\(45 \\times N\\) total games played.\n   - We know the total number of games played is 900.\n   - Therefore, we can set up the equation: \\(45 \\times N = 900\\).\n\n4. **Solve for \\(N\\)**\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 45 to solve for \\(N\\).\n   - \\(N = \\frac{900}{45}\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Result**\n   - \\(N = 20\\).\n\n**Check the Solution**\n\n- Quick check: I calculated there are 45 unique pairs, and each plays 20 times to make up the total 900 games. \\(45 \\times 20 = 900\\), which matches our total games.\n- This confirms my solution. It seems logical and aligns properly with the provided information.\n\n**Reflection**\n\nThis problem aligns well with my initial strategy of identifying it as a combinatorial problem involving pairs. My hunch about solving it via combinations (forming pairs of players) was correct, and no changes in approach were needed after setting up the right equation.\n\nIf I doubted my answer along the way, I could compare the logic to similar problems I've solved before and consider if there's an overlooked assumption. But given the straightforward setup and calculations, I'm confident in the solution.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe value of \\(N\\) is 20, meaning each member plays against every other member 20 times. This solution makes sense based on the combinatorial setup and checks out with the total number of games played.",

  "ground_truth": "Since there are 10 club members, there are $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10\\cdot 9}{2} = 45$ pairings of members.  Thus, each pair must have played $\\frac{900}{45} = \\boxed{20}$ games."
