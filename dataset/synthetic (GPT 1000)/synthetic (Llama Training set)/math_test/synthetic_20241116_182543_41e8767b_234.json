    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem by breaking it down into clear, incremental steps. I'm going to start by simply understanding the setup and thinking through different approaches to find \\( AC \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nLet's list out what we know:\n- \\( AE = 40 \\) cm\n- \\( AD = 30 \\) cm\n- \\( BE = 20 \\) cm\n- \\( C \\) is the midpoint of \\( \\overline{BD} \\)\n\nThe main goal is to find \\( AC \\). The labeling on the number line has the points \\( A, B, C, D, E \\). Initially, this reminds me of a similar problem I've done with number lines and distances.\n\n### Step 2: Recognizing Relationships\nLet's put the given distances in context:\n\n1. From \\( AE = 40 \\) and \\( AD = 30 \\), we know \\( DE = AE - AD = 40 - 30 = 10 \\). \n2. Since \\( DE = 10 \\) cm, and \\( BE = 20 \\) cm, \\( B \\) must be closer to \\( A \\) compared to \\( D \\).\n\nHmm, let's see how positions might work on a line:\n- \\( A \\) starts at \\( 0 \\).\n- Assume \\( D \\) is at \\( x \\), therefore \\( \\overline{AD} \\) suggests \\( x = 30 \\).\n- \\( E \\) is \\( 10 \\) cm from \\( D \\), so \\( E = x + 10 = 40 \\).\n\nThis gives a good check since it aligns with \\( AE = 40 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Positioning \\( B \\) and \\( C \\)\nGiven \\( BE = 20 \\) cm, and using \\( E = 40 \\):\n\\[ B = E - BE = 40 - 20 = 20 \\]\n\nNow, we know:\n- \\( B = 20 \\)\n- \\( D = 30 \\)\n\nSince \\( C \\) is the midpoint of \\( BD \\):\n- \\[ C = \\frac{B + D}{2} = \\frac{20 + 30}{2} = 25 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find \\( AC \\)\nFinally, with \\( A = 0 \\) and \\( C = 25 \\), the distance \\( AC \\) is:\n\\[ AC = C - A = 25 - 0 = 25 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nI think I've pieced everything together correctly. Before finalizing, let me step back and quickly verify:\n- All positions calculated (B, D, E) logically follow from the given relationships.\n- Distances with given measurements match the calculations.\n\nThis consistent coherence in the problem ensures \\( AC = 25 \\) cm makes sense. It's tempting to first think of overly complicated strategies, but after a revisit, recognizing simpler, direct calculations from number line principles is often robust. This solution does look right overall, capturing both linear and arithmetic consistency throughout.",

  "ground_truth": "We have $AB+BD=30\\text{ cm}$, $BD+DE=20\\text{ cm}$, and $AB+BD+DE=40\\text{ cm}$.  Summing the first two equations and subtracting the third gives $BD=30\\text{ cm}+20\\text{ cm}-40\\text{ cm}=10$ cm.  Therefore, $BC=BD/2=5\\text{ cm}$, $AB=AD-BD=20\\text{ cm}$, and $AC=AB+BC=5\\text{ cm}+20\\text{ cm}=\\boxed{25}\\text{ cm}$."
