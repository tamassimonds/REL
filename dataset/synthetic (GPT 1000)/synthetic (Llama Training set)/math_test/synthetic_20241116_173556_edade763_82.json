    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, this seems to be a geometry problem involving points, midpoints, and reflections. I'll break it down step-by-step, following a natural thought process. \n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\nWe have two points, \\( P(1, 3) \\) and \\( R(7, 15) \\). \n\nThe problem asks us to first find the midpoint \\( M \\) of the segment \\( PR \\), then consider what happens when the segment \\( PR \\) is reflected over the \\( x \\)-axis. Finally, we need to find and sum the coordinates of the image of the midpoint after reflection.\n\n**Step 2: Find the midpoint \\( M \\) of segment \\( PR \\)**\n\nMidpoint \\( M \\) of a segment with endpoints \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) can be found using the formula:\n\\[\nM = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nApplying this to our points \\( P(1, 3) \\) and \\( R(7, 15) \\):\n\\[\nM = \\left( \\frac{1 + 7}{2}, \\frac{3 + 15}{2} \\right) = (4, 9)\n\\]\n\nSo the midpoint \\( M \\) is \\( (4, 9) \\). That calculation seems straightforward, but let me quickly double-check... Yes, both coordinates make sense mathematically.\n\n**Step 3: Reflect segment \\( PR \\) over the \\( x \\)-axis**\n\nWhen a point \\( (x, y) \\) is reflected over the \\( x \\)-axis, its image becomes \\( (x, -y) \\).\n\nReflecting \\( P(1, 3) \\) gives \\( P'(1, -3) \\).\n\nReflecting \\( R(7, 15) \\) gives \\( R'(7, -15) \\).\n\nIt's useful to visualize this or sketch it out, but conceptually, that makes sense: reflecting over the \\( x \\)-axis keeps \\( x \\) the same, flips \\( y \\).\n\n**Step 4: Find the midpoint \\( M' \\) of the reflected segment \\( P'R' \\)**\n\nNow, we find the midpoint of the new segment with endpoints \\( P'(1, -3) \\) and \\( R'(7, -15) \\):\n\\[\nM' = \\left( \\frac{1 + 7}{2}, \\frac{-3 - 15}{2} \\right) = (4, -9)\n\\]\n\nAs a quick check, do these numbers make sense? Yes, they seem correct based on our reflection logic.\n\n**Step 5: Sum the coordinates of M', the midpoint of the reflected segment**\n\n\\( M' \\) is \\( (4, -9) \\). We need the sum of its coordinates:\n\\[\n4 + (-9) = 4 - 9 = -5\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of the coordinates of the image of the midpoint is \\(-5\\).\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration, where we found and verified midpoints and considered reflections, makes sense. There were no major pitfalls or errors; the calculations and geometric reasoning align well. This reinforces our final answer:\n\n**Final Answer: \\(-5\\)**",

  "ground_truth": "Point $M$ has coordinates $(4,9)$. Therefore, its image has coordinates $(4,-9)$. Thus the sum is $\\boxed{-5}$.\n\nAlternatively, the image of point $M$ is the midpoint of the images of points $P$ and $R$ and thus is the midpoint of $(1,-3)$ and $(7,-15)$, which is also $(4,-9)$."
