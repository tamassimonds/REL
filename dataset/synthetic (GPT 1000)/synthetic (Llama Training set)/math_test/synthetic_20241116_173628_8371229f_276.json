    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n- At first glance, this is a problem involving a parametric curve defined by trigonometric functions. The expression on the curve might remind me of a classical trigonometric identity. But I see that the problem involves expressing the parametric equation in a polynomial form: \\( ax^4 - bx^2 + cy^2 = 0 \\). \n\nBrainstorming initial strategies:\n- I could try translating the trigonometric functions to their algebraic counterparts using trigonometric identities. \n- Since \\(x = \\sin t\\) and \\(y = \\sin 2t\\), I remember that \\(\\sin 2t = 2 \\sin t \\cos t\\).\n- Perhaps using the identity \\(\\cos^2 t = 1 - \\sin^2 t\\) might help convert everything to \\(x\\)-related terms. \n\nLet's try to explore this step by step.\n\nStep-by-step exploration:\n\n1. **Express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   y = \\sin 2t = 2 \\sin t \\cos t = 2x \\sqrt{1-x^2}\n   \\]\n   - Noticing the square root is cumbersome for polynomial forms, but we can square both sides if needed later.\n\n2. **Square both sides to eliminate the square root:**\n   \\[\n   y^2 = (2x \\sqrt{1-x^2})^2 = 4x^2(1-x^2) = 4x^2 - 4x^4\n   \\]\n   - Ah, this is giving us something that resembles polynomial terms.\n\n3. **Re-arrange into polynomial form:**\n   \\[\n   y^2 = 4x^2 - 4x^4 \\implies 4x^4 - 4x^2 + y^2 = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert to the given form:**\n   - We have the structure \\(4x^4 - 4x^2 + y^2 = 0\\), which matches \\(ax^4 - bx^2 + cy^2 = 0\\).\n   - Identify coefficients: \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = 4\\), \\(c = 1\\).\n\n5. **Calculate \\(a + b + c\\):**\n   \\[\n   4 + 4 + 1 = 9\n   \\]\n\nReflecting:\n- The entire expression seemed structured with symmetric coefficients which makes sense. I checked the work visually and conceptually frequently to ensure each conversion and manipulation was logical and correct.\n- The parametric aspect was handled by directly applying known identities, which simplified the problem efficiently.\n\nFinal Check:\n- The achieved polynomial form is verified to map from the original trigonometric equation, affirming the trigonometric identities were correctly utilized.\n\nSo, after the verification and reflection, the smallest possible value of \\(a + b + c\\) is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",
