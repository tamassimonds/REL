    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. It seems like a classic coordinate geometry question involving parallel and perpendicular lines. Let's explore it step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's unpack what's happening:\n\n1. **Line \\(a\\)**: We know that it is parallel to line \\(b\\) and it passes through the point \\((1,2)\\). We're looking for its y-intercept.\n\n2. **Line \\(b\\)**: It is perpendicular to line \\(c\\) and passes through point \\((3,1)\\).\n\n3. **Line \\(c\\)**: Given by the equation \\(y = -2x + 3\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nFor a line parallel to another:\n- They share the same slope.\n\nFor a line perpendicular to another:\n- The slopes are negative reciprocals of each other.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s find the slope of line \\(b\\) since it is crucial for solving the parallel and perpendicular conditions.\n\n### Finding the Slope of Line \\(b\\)\n\n**Line \\(c\\)**: The slope of line \\(c\\) is \\(-2\\).\n\nSince line \\(b\\) is perpendicular to line \\(c\\), the slope of line \\(b\\) will be the negative reciprocal of \\(-2\\). \n\n- Negative reciprocal of \\(-2\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSo, the slope \\(m_b\\) of line \\(b\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nChecking: Perpendicular slopes should multiply to \\(-1\\). \\((-2) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -1\\). This confirms our slope of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) for line \\(b\\).\n\n### Finding Equation of Line \\(b\\)\n\nNow, we use the slope-point form to find the equation of line \\(b\\) which passes through \\((3,1)\\):\n\n\\[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\]\n\nSubstitute \\(m = \\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(x_1 = 3\\), and \\(y_1 = 1\\):\n\n\\[ y - 1 = \\frac{1}{2}(x - 3) \\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[ y - 1 = \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2} + 1 \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nThe y-intercept of line \\(b\\) is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n### Line \\(a\\) (Parallel to Line \\(b\\))\n\nSince line \\(a\\) is parallel to line \\(b\\), it will have the same slope as line \\(b\\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nLine \\(a\\) passes through \\((1,2)\\). Again using the point-slope form:\n\n\\[ y - 2 = \\frac{1}{2}(x - 1) \\]\n\nLet\u2019s expand this to find the y-intercept:\n\n\\[ y - 2 = \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2} + 2 \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nSo, the y-intercept of line \\(a\\) is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n### Checking the Solution\n\nReflecting on each step, everything seems consistent:\n\n- The relationship between slopes of perpendicular lines checked out.\n- Equations derived using point-slope form matched expected characterizations.\n- Parallel slopes remain identical.\n\nIt all seems to hold together, so the y-intercept of line \\(a\\) is indeed \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nI feel confident that this solves the problem correctly, but will continue to reflect on the solve approach next time should things feel ambiguous at any point.",

  "ground_truth": "The slopes of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals. Therefore, the slope of line $b$ is the negative reciprocal of $-2$, which is $\\frac12$. The slopes of parallel lines are the same, therefore the slope of line $a$ is also $\\frac12$. Using the point-slope formula, the equation of line $a$ is $y-2=\\frac12(x-1)$. Changing the form to slope-intercept, we get the equation $y=\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac32$. Therefore, the y-intercept is $\\boxed{\\frac32}$."
