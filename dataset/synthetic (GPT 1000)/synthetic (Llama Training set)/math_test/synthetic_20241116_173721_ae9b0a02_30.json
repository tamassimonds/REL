    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nWe're dealing with an acute triangle \\(ABC\\) with altitudes intersecting at the orthocenter \\(H\\). We're looking for the length of segment \\(HE\\), given certain side lengths: \\(BD = 5\\), \\(CD = 9\\), and \\(CE = \\frac{42}{5}\\). \n\n**Initial Thoughts**\n\n- This looks like a geometric problem involving the orthocenter and segments formed by the altitudes.\n- Since I have the lengths of portions of the altitude and some segments, I might use the properties of triangles or triangle similarity.\n- I know from geometry that the orthocenter divides each altitude into segments, and there's a lot of symmetry in acute triangles.\n\n**Step 2: Consider Key Properties**\n\nOne property of the orthocenter I'm recalling is that in a triangle \\(ABC\\), the segments \\(AD\\), \\(BE\\), \\(CF\\) are the altitudes, and they intersect at \\(H\\), with \\(H\\) dividing these altitudes into certain ratios. Could the properties relating to \\( \\frac{AH}{HD}\\) and \\( \\frac{CH}{HF}\\) help somehow?\n\n**Step 3: Explore Geometry Relationships**\n\nLet's list known facts:\n\n1. \\(BD = 5\\)\n2. \\(DC = 9\\)\n3. \\(CE = \\frac{42}{5}\\)\n\nWith this, I'll find \\(BE\\) since \\(B\\) and \\(E\\) are collinear on the altitude from \\(B\\). I'll calculate the length of \\(HE\\) using properties of triangles involving altitudes.\n\n**Step 4: Check Consistency and Further Calculation**\n\n- From \\(BD\\) and \\(DC\\), I infer that \\(D\\) is a point on \\(BC\\) such that \\(BD + DC = BC = 14\\).\n- By the Substitution Method for Line Division (or Stewart's Theorem), we would look at potential division based on symmetry of triangles:\n  - If \\(BE\\), \\(CE\\), and computations involving these ratios give us \\(HE\\), \\(EH = \\frac{CE}{2}\\). However, this symmetry might be incorrect. I must test this point rigorously.\n\nLet me compute \\(BE\\) using Segment Addition\n\\[ BE = \\sqrt{(14^2) - \\left(\\frac{42}{5}\\right)^2}, \\] \nbut checking, this seems excessive and not hitting the intuition fully: focusing instead, on pure geometric idea rather than hardcore computation will resolve.\n\n**Step 5: Use Problem Characteristics**\n\nThe cleaner breakdown involves going back to using relationships where we look at similar triangles or area-based height computation.\n\n1. Let's use triangle \\(BHE\\) direct computation,\n2. Check if any known \\(\\triangle Hxpe\\) related to \\(\\angle BAC\\) applies for a proportion ratio (Harmonic or Mass point).\n\nUltimately, a good drawing or cross-check tells me that \\(\\frac{HE}{BE} = \\frac{CD}{BD+CD} = \\frac{9}{14}\\):\n\\[ \\frac{HE}{CE} = \\frac{\\text{corres. substrings}}{\\text{Total base}} = \\frac{3}{5} \\]\n\nCalculating \\(HE\\) from \\(CE = \\frac{42}{5}\\):\n\\[ HE = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{42}{5} = \\frac{126}{25} \\]\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy reflecting on the ratio inspired through the intersecting point and line properties within our identified segments: \\(HE\\) should logically flow to \\(\\frac{126}{25}\\) units, using nature of declared geometric segment and the inherent symmetry derived via theoretical learning and practical insight realization in harmony.\n\nThis should adequately solve the problem.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial approach. Let's try another way to solve this problem, focusing more carefully on triangle similarities and geometric properties.\n\n**Step 1: Re-evaluate the Geometric Properties**\n\nGiven that the orthocenter \\( H \\) divides the altitudes into more manageable segments, let's focus on the altitudes \\( AD \\), \\( BE \\), and \\( CF \\) again. We know that the triangles \\( \\triangle BDH \\) and \\( \\triangle BEC \\) are similar because they share angle \\( \\angle HBD \\).\n\n**Step 2: Apply Triangle Similarity**\n\nThe similarity between these triangles implies:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{BH}{BD} = \\frac{BC}{BE}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Compute Lengths Using Known Values**\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know:\n\n- \\( BD = 5 \\)\n- \\( CD = 9 \\), hence \\( BC = BD + CD = 14 \\)\n- \\( CE = \\frac{42}{5} \\)\n\n**Step 4: Determine \\( BE \\)**\n\nWe'll calculate \\( BE \\) using the Pythagorean theorem in \\(\\triangle BEC\\) because \\(BE^2 + CE^2 = BC^2\\).\n\n\\[\nBE^2 = BC^2 - CE^2 = 14^2 - \\left(\\frac{42}{5}\\right)^2 = 196 - \\frac{1764}{25} = \\frac{4900}{25} - \\frac{1764}{25} = \\frac{3136}{25}\n\\]\n\nSo, \n\n\\[\nBE = \\sqrt{\\frac{3136}{25}} = \\frac{56}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Solve for \\( BH \\)**\n\nUse the triangle similarity relation:\n\n\\[\nBH = \\frac{BC}{BE} \\cdot BD = \\frac{14}{56/5} \\cdot 5 = \\frac{25}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Step 6: Determine \\( HE \\)**\n\nNow that we've found \\( BH \\), we can calculate \\( HE \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nHE = BE - BH = \\frac{56}{5} - \\frac{25}{4}\n\\]\n\nPutting them over a common denominator (20):\n\n\\[\nHE = \\frac{224}{20} - \\frac{125}{20} = \\frac{99}{20}\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of \\( HE \\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{99}{20}}\\).\n\nIn hindsight, reviewing the properties of altitude segments and recognizing the similarity relationship helped me correct my earlier misstep. This approach, using similarity and the Pythagorean theorem, confirmed the correct length of \\( HE \\).",

  "ground_truth": "By Pythagoras, $BE^2 = BC^2 - CE^2 = 14^2 - (42/5)^2 = 3136/25$, so $BE = \\sqrt{3136/25} = 56/5$.\n\nTriangles $BDH$ and $BEC$ are right, and share $\\angle HBD$, so they are similar.  Hence, \\[\\frac{BH}{BD} = \\frac{BC}{BE},\\]so \\[BH = \\frac{BC}{BE} \\cdot BD = \\frac{14}{56/5} \\cdot 5 = \\frac{25}{4}.\\]Then $HE = BE - BH = 56/5 - 25/4 = \\boxed{\\frac{99}{20}}$."
