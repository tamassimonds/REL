    "working_out": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**  \nWhen I first read the problem, \"In how many ways can 13 students be selected from a group of 15 students,\" I immediately think about combinations because the order in which we select the students doesn't matter. This reminds me of similar problems I've solved where I had to choose a subset from a larger set.\n\n**Brainstorming Different Strategies:**  \n1. **Combinatorial Approach:** My first thought is to use combinations. Normally, for such problems, the formula for combinations \\(\\binom{n}{r}\\) (read as \"n choose r\") is used where \\(n\\) is the total number and \\(r\\) is the number to choose. This seems directly applicable here.\n\n2. **Complementary Counting:** Another strategy that popped into my head is using complementary counting, where instead of directly selecting 13 students, I could consider choosing 2 students NOT in the team from 15 and subtract from the total. But that feels like it would give the same solution as the direct combination approach.\n\n3. **Recursive Thinking:** This type of thinking could be trying to build up the team by adding one student at a time, but I quickly realize this will get complex and isn't efficient for this problem.\n\n**Let's Implement the Combinatorial Approach:**  \n\n1. **Use Combination Formula:**  \n   The formula to calculate combinations is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r! \\times (n-r)!}\n   \\]\n   So for this problem, \\(n = 15\\) and \\(r = 13\\).\n\n2. **Calculating it out:**  \n   \\[\n   \\binom{15}{13} = \\frac{15!}{13! \\times (15-13)!} = \\frac{15!}{13! \\times 2!}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the factorials, I realize:\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{15 \\times 14}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{210}{2} = 105\n   \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- The denominator \\(2!\\) is indeed 2, because there's not much to \\(2!\\).\n- The cancellation from the \\(13!\\) on both top and bottom is correct.\n- Calculating \\(15 \\times 14 = 210\\), I definitely know this multiplication is right, and dividing by 2 gives 105. This number doesn't seem too large or small for the context of choosing.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- This approach definitely made sense; using combinations for a selection is the right way.\n- I thought about complementary counting, but calculating directly seems simple and faster; the complementary method would also yield \\(\\binom{15}{2}\\), which also evaluates to 105, confirming this method's calculation.\n\n**A Quick Check on Methodology:**  \n- The method makes sense as it carefully considers ordering isn't important, just who is selected.\n\n**Aha Moment:**  \n- Once I confirmed the combination formula application and the arithmetic, everything clicked. This is straightforward, yet shows the importance of using proper formulas and order of operations in math.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n- There are 105 ways to select 13 students from a group of 15.",
