    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process step by step, showing how I consider different strategies, reflect on whether they seem correct, and adjust my approach if necessary.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nFirst, let's clarify the problem. We have a book with \\( n \\) leaves, where each leaf contributes 2 pages. Therefore, the number of pages, denoted as \\( 2n \\), is given as \"3 more than a multiple of 7.\" Also, it's specified that \\( n > 100 \\). Our task is to find the smallest possible value for \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 2: Translating Conditions into Mathematical Expressions\nThe condition \"3 more than a multiple of 7\" can be expressed mathematically as:\n\\[ 2n = 7k + 3 \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is an integer. This indicates that:\n\\[ 2n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( n \\)\nLet's express \\( n \\) in terms of \\( k \\):\n\\[ n = \\frac{7k + 3}{2} \\]\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, \\( 7k + 3 \\) should be even. Notice that 7 is odd, so \\( k \\) must be odd for \\( 7k + 3 \\) to be even.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Smallest \\( n > 100 \\)\nNow, since \\( 7k + 3 \\) has to be even, \\( k \\) = 1, 3, 5, 7, ... are possible. But let's start calculating from \\( n > 100 \\).\n\nFirst, estimate the range:\nSince \\( n = \\frac{7k + 3}{2} > 100 \\),\n\\[ 7k + 3 > 200 \\]\n\\[ 7k > 197 \\]\n\\[ k > \\frac{197}{7} \\approx 28.14 \\]\n\nGiven \\( k \\) needs to be an odd integer, start checking from \\( k = 29 \\):\n\n- **For \\( k = 29 \\):**\n  \\[\n  2n = 7(29) + 3 = 203 + 3 = 206 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n = \\frac{206}{2} = 103\n  \\]\n  \\( n = 103 \\) is valid since it is greater than 100.\n\nSince \\( n = 103 \\) satisfies all the conditions, let's pause here to reflect.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Solution\n- Check: \\( 2n = 206 \\) is indeed \\( 3 \\) more than \\( 203 \\), which is a multiple of \\( 7 \\).\n- Check: \\( n = 103 > 100 \\).\n\nEverything seems to check out. Let's consider if there might be any overlooked smaller possible value of \\( n \\). But since \\( k \\) was the minimum odd integer greater than 28.14 and increasing \\( k \\) further increases \\( n \\), \\( n = 103 \\) should indeed be the smallest possible value.\n\nThus, the smallest possible number of leaves is **103**.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $m$ be the least possible number of leaves. Then $2m$ is the least possible number of pages. We know that $2m\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\\implies 8m \\equiv 3\\cdot 4\\pmod 7\\implies m\\equiv 12\\equiv 5\\pmod 7$. So $m=5+7a$ for some positive integer $a$. The smallest such number greater than $100$ is $5+7\\cdot 14=\\boxed{103}$."
