    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together. We're evaluating \\( \\left(\\frac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2 \\). \n\n### First Impressions\n- **Hmm**... This looks like a complex number squared. I remember that \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit with the property that \\( i^2 = -1 \\). Keeping that in mind will be important.\n- This is similar to squaring a fraction, except we have an imaginary number involved. The process might require some careful handling of \\( i \\).\n\n### Brainstorming\n- We could tackle this like a regular algebraic problem by squaring both the numerator and denominator separately. But let's ensure the approach for \\( i \\) is sound.\n- Squaring the numerator specifically will involve \\( (-2i) \\times (-2i) \\), which simplifies to \\( (-2)^2 \\times i^2 \\).\n  \n### Starting Calculations\n\n1. **Square the Numerator**:\n   \\[\n   (-2i)^2 = (-2) \\times (-2) \\times (i \\times i) = 4 \\times i^2\n   \\]\n   - I recall \\( i^2 = -1 \\), so the expression becomes:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times (-1) = -4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Square the Denominator**:\n   \\[\n   5^2 = 25\n   \\]\n\n3. **Putting it Together**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{-2i}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(-2i)^2}{5^2} = \\frac{-4}{25}\n   \\]\n\n### Reflection and Verification\n- Let's check each step. The \\( (-2i) \\times (-2i) \\) simplification is correct with the properties of \\( i \\). The process of squaring the fraction by squaring both the numerator and denominator separately holds up.\n- My final expression \\( \\frac{-4}{25} \\) seems reasonable in size and form. No steps appear skipped or reasoned incorrectly.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n- I made sure that each part of the process, especially handling \\( i^2 \\), was correctly applied. The main task was ensuring the use of \\( i^2 = -1 \\) was executed properly.\n- No alternative strategy seems necessary here; the direct calculation worked well.\n  \nThe final evaluated result, with all steps considered, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{-4}{25}}\n\\]",
