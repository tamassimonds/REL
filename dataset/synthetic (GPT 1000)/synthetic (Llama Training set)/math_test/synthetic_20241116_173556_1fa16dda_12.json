    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this step-by-step. At first glance, this problem is about combining ratios or fractions. We want to find \\(\\frac{a}{d}\\) given a chain of relationships between variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nThe problem wants us to find the ratio \\(\\frac{a}{d}\\) using the given ratios:\n- \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{3}{5}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{15}{6}\\) \n- \\(\\frac{c}{d} = 6\\)\n\n**Step 2: Explore Different Strategies**\n\nA few strategies come to mind:\n1. Direct substitution: Maybe I can substitute values and simplify step by step.\n2. Multiplying through the chain of relations: This looks promising, combining all the fractions directly.\n3. Check if there\u2019s a simpler path or shortcut by simplifying each ratio quickly before combining.\n\nGiven the fraction nature, option 2, multiplying through the chain, seems solid. But I'll explore if simplification in the ratios can help ease calculations. \n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Ratios**\n\nFirst, let's look at \\(\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{15}{6}\\). I can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{15 \\div 3}{6 \\div 3} = \\frac{5}{2}\n\\]\n\nAlright, that's simpler.\n\n**Step 4: Chain the Ratios Together**\n\nSince I want to get from \\(a\\) to \\(d\\), I need to use the relations \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), \\(\\frac{b}{c}\\), and \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\). I am essentially trying to find \\(\\frac{a}{d}\\) by multiplying these ratios, following how they are chained:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{d} = \\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{b}{c}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{c}{d}\\right)\n\\]\n\nLet's plug the values:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{3}{5}\\)\n2. The simplified \\(\\frac{b}{c} = \\frac{5}{2}\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{c}{d} = 6\\)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{d} = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) \\times 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Calculate Step by Step**\n\nMultiply \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{15}{10} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nNext, multiply the result by 6:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2} \\times 6 = \\frac{18}{2} = 9\n\\]\n\n**Step 6: Check and Reflect**\n\nLet me think about this calculation\u2014did I correctly multiply and simplify? I believe it checks out because:\n\n- The simplification of \\(\\frac{15}{6}\\) to \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\) was correct.\n- The multiplication \\(\\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{5}{2}\\) gave me \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), which further multiplied by 6 correctly yielded 9.\n\nUsing this approach, the answer seems consistently derived. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe value of \\(\\frac{a}{d}\\) is 9. This method flowed well, and considering all checks are correct, it looks like I've captured the right solution!",
