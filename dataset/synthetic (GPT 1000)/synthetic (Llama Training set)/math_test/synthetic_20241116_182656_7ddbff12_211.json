    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: Okay, we have two coins, A and B. Coin A is tossed three times, and Coin B is tossed two times. We need to find the probability that the number of heads from Coin A is greater than the number of heads from Coin B. This looks like a classic probability problem involving binomial distributions because each coin flip is an independent event with two possible outcomes: heads or tails.\n\n### Step 2: Explore Possible Strategies\n\n1. **List Possible Outcomes**: One way might be to calculate all possible outcomes of heads for both coins and count the favorable cases. But with 3 tosses for Coin A and 2 for B, that could be too complicated without a systematic approach.\n2. **Use of Mathematical Formulae**: This seems more efficient. We can use the binomial probability formula to express the chances of getting a certain number of heads for each coin.\n3. **Comparative Strategy**: Focus only on comparing the number of heads in each case, rather than computing all absolute head counts.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Outcomes and Probabilities\n\nFor Coin A tossed 3 times:\n- Possible number of heads: 0, 1, 2, 3\n\nFor Coin B tossed 2 times:\n- Possible number of heads: 0, 1, 2\n\n#### Binomial Probabilities\n\n- For Coin A, \\( P(X = k) = \\binom{3}{k} (0.5)^3 \\).\n- For Coin B, \\( P(Y = m) = \\binom{2}{m} (0.5)^2 \\).\n\nLet's calculate these probabilities.\n\n#### Coin A Probabilities:\n\n- \\( P(A=0) = \\binom{3}{0}(0.5)^3 = 1 \\times 0.125 = 0.125 \\)\n- \\( P(A=1) = \\binom{3}{1}(0.5)^3 = 3 \\times 0.125 = 0.375 \\)\n- \\( P(A=2) = \\binom{3}{2}(0.5)^3 = 3 \\times 0.125 = 0.375 \\)\n- \\( P(A=3) = \\binom{3}{3}(0.5)^3 = 1 \\times 0.125 = 0.125 \\)\n\n#### Coin B Probabilities:\n\n- \\( P(B=0) = \\binom{2}{0}(0.5)^2 = 1 \\times 0.25 = 0.25 \\)\n- \\( P(B=1) = \\binom{2}{1}(0.5)^2 = 2 \\times 0.25 = 0.5 \\)\n- \\( P(B=2) = \\binom{2}{2}(0.5)^2 = 1 \\times 0.25 = 0.25 \\)\n\n### Step 4: Enumerate Favorable Comparisons\n\nNow, we compare the number of heads:\n1. A beats B when:\n    - \\( A = 1 \\), \\( B = 0 \\)\n    - \\( A = 2 \\), \\( B = 0 \\)\n    - \\( A = 2 \\), \\( B = 1 \\)\n    - \\( A = 3 \\), \\( B = 0 \\)\n    - \\( A = 3 \\), \\( B = 1 \\)\n    - \\( A = 3 \\), \\( B = 2 \\)\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Total Probability for Favorable Cases\n\n#### Joint Probabilities\n\n- For \\( A = 1, B = 0 \\): \\( 0.375 \\times 0.25 = 0.09375 \\)\n- For \\( A = 2, B = 0 \\): \\( 0.375 \\times 0.25 = 0.09375 \\)\n- For \\( A = 2, B = 1 \\): \\( 0.375 \\times 0.5 = 0.1875 \\)\n- For \\( A = 3, B = 0 \\): \\( 0.125 \\times 0.25 = 0.03125 \\)\n- For \\( A = 3, B = 1 \\): \\( 0.125 \\times 0.5 = 0.0625 \\)\n- For \\( A = 3, B = 2 \\): \\( 0.125 \\times 0.25 = 0.03125 \\)\n\nAdd these probabilities up for total favorable probability:\n- Total = \\( 0.09375 + 0.09375 + 0.1875 + 0.03125 + 0.0625 + 0.03125 = 0.5 \\)\n\n### Step 6: Reflect and Verify\n\nHalf of the possible scenarios fit the criteria of Coin A having more heads than Coin B. This makes logical sense given the symmetry of fair coin tosses. The calculated probability is \\( 0.5 \\), which could reasonably be expected given the setup.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe probability that more heads are tossed using Coin A than using Coin B is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "More generally, suppose coin $A$ is tossed $n + 1$ times and coin $B$ is tossed $n$ times.\n\nConsider the situation when coin $A$ has been tossed $n$ times and coin $B$ has been tossed $n$ times.  At this point, in terms of heads, either $A$ is ahead of $B,$ $B$ is ahead of $A,$ or they are tied.  Let $p$ be the probability that $A$ is ahead of $B.$  Then by symmetry, $p$ is the probability that $B$ is ahead of $A,$ so the probability of a tie is $1 - 2p.$\n\nNow coin $A$ is tossed one more time.  If coin $A$ ends up with more heads, then either it was ahead before the last flip (which occurs with probability $p$), or it was tied before the last flip and got heads for the last flip (which occurs with probability $(1 - 2p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$).  Therefore, the probability that coins $A$ ends up with more heads is\n\\[p + (1 - 2p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\]"
