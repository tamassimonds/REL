  "problem": "Alice, Bailey, Cindy, and Daniel walked around their neighborhoods selling pens. Alice earned $\\$25.67$, Bailey earned $\\$17.21$, Cindy earned $\\$39.17$, and Daniel earned $\\$26.32$. After the sale, they pooled their money together and went to the bank to convert the coins into dollars. How many cents in change did they have left after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem!\n\n### First Impressions\nAt first glance, this looks like a straightforward problem involving money conversion. I notice that they are dealing with cents and dollars. The question is mainly focused on the cents left after changing as much as possible into whole dollars. \n\nHmm, that reminds me of an approach I've used before, where I need to focus on the conversion of cents to dollars. I haven\u2019t seen any mention of having to split the money among themselves; it's just about pooling and converting. \n\n### Brainstorming\n- **Add up all the earnings:** So, the first step is to find out the total amount of money they collected together.\n- **Convert to total cents:** Make sure to convert this total into cents since it will be easier to manage when dealing with decimal values (dollars to cents).\n- **Calculate leftover cents:** Determine how many full dollars can be extracted from the total cents. The leftover would be our answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1. **Calculate Individual Earnings in Cents:**\n   - Alice: \\$25.67 = \\(25 \\times 100 + 67 = 2567\\) cents\n   - Bailey: \\$17.21 = \\(17 \\times 100 + 21 = 1721\\) cents\n   - Cindy: \\$39.17 = \\(39 \\times 100 + 17 = 3917\\) cents\n   - Daniel: \\$26.32 = \\(26 \\times 100 + 32 = 2632\\) cents\n\n   Wait, let's double-check here: \n   - \\(2567\\), \\(1721\\), \\(3917\\), \\(2632\\) - yes these add up from the previous conversion correctly.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Earnings in Cents:**\n   - Add all the cents together: \\(2567 + 1721 + 3917 + 2632\\)\n   - Let me quickly do the math:\n     - \\(2567 + 1721 = 4288\\)\n     - \\(4288 + 3917 = 8205\\)\n     - \\(8205 + 2632 = 10837\\)\n     \n   We have a total of \\(10837\\) cents. Hmm, this seems right but let me double check the addition. Yes, that looks correct on a quick re-check.\n\n3. **Convert Total to Dollars and Cents:**\n   - **Full Dollars Extractable:** \\(10837 \\div 100 = 108\\) full dollars\n   - **Leftover Cents:** \\(10837 - 10800 = 37\\) cents\n\n   All right, so we were able to form 108 full dollars, and there are 37 cents leftover. Where did these leftover cents come from? Well, remember, each person had some 'extra' if you will, beyond whole dollars initially, and collectively this added up to 37 cents after conversion.\n\n### Reflecting\nLooking over this again:\n- We calculated totals cohesively using basic arithmetic.\n- Focused on conversions correctly: total cents first, then dollars and remaining cents.\n- Quick checks seem good, no glaring errors in logic.\n  \n### Conclusion\nSo, after pooling their money and converting as many coins to bills as possible, they have **37 cents** left. This matches our expectations based on the conversions conducted. It's neat how breaking down a problem into smaller, tangible steps can lead you to the correct figure efficiently!",

  "ground_truth": "Instead of adding large numbers together, we can find the residue for each person for easier computation. We convert the amount they earned to cents and find the modulo $100$ for each.  \\begin{align*}\n2567 &\\equiv 67 \\pmod{100}\\\\\n1721 &\\equiv 21 \\pmod{100}\\\\\n3917 &\\equiv 17 \\pmod{100}\\\\\n2632 &\\equiv 32 \\pmod{100}\n\\end{align*}We want to find the modulo $100$ of the total number of cents. We can add the separate residues to get $$67+21+17+32 \\equiv 137 \\equiv 37 \\pmod{100}$$Therefore, they have $\\boxed{37}$ cents left after converting as much of the money into bills as possible."
