    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: we're tasked with finding the remainder when \\(13^{13} + 5\\) is divided by 6.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nFirst off, I notice that this problem involves modulo operations, which often can allow for simplifications. There's something familiar about the structure of \\(13^{13}\\) being divided by a number, suggesting patterns or cycle behavior could exist. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern in powers of 13 mod 6, such as periodic behavior or simplifications...\n\n### Step 1: Simplify 13 Modulo 6\n\nLet's start by understanding what \\(13\\) is equivalent to mod 6. A quick division gives us:\n\n\\[ 13 \\div 6 = 2 \\text{ with a remainder of } 1.\\]\n\nSo:\n\\[ 13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}. \\]\n\nThis means any power of 13, when divided by 6, might simplify into something more manageable.\n\n### Step 2: Explore the Powers\n\nGiven our observation that \\(13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}\\), let's compute the first few powers to spot any pattern:\n\n\\[\n13^1 \\equiv 1^1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n13^2 \\equiv 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n13^3 \\equiv 1^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\n\nI see a trend here... every power of 13 seems to maintain the equivalence of 1 modulo 6. Let's test a bit further just to be sure:\n\n\\[\n13^4 \\equiv 1^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\n\nOh! This is apparent now: no matter how many times we multiply 1 by itself, it will always be 1. Therefore:\n\n\\[ \n13^{13} \\equiv 1^{13} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6} \n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Add and Simplify\n\nNow, return to the original expression \\(13^{13} + 5\\).\n\nGiven what we derived:\n\n\\[ \n13^{13} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\n\nThe expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n13^{13} + 5 \\equiv 1 + 5 \\pmod{6} \n\\]\n\nSimplifying gives us:\n\n\\[\n1 + 5 = 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo, the remainder when \\(13^{13} + 5\\) is divided by 6 is **0**.\n\n### Reflections\n\nThis approach feels solid - the steps all logically connect, leveraging modulo arithmetic to simplify the problem. This exercise illustrates how recognizing a simplification led to a straightforward solution without delving into huge computations. An initial potential complexity was reduced to a simple insight about powers modulo a number.",

  "ground_truth": "Start off by looking for a pattern. $(13^1 + 5)/6$ leaves no remainder; $(13^2 + 5)/6$ leaves no remainder, ..., $(13^k +5)/6$ always leaves no remainder. This is true because $13$ is $1$ more than a multiple of $6$, so any power of $13$ will also be $1$ more than a multiple of $6$. When $5$ is added to a number that is $1$ more than a multiple of $6$, the result is a multiple of $6$, so the remainder is $\\boxed{0}$."
