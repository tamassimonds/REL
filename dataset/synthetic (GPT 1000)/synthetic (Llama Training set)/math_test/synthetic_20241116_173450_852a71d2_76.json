    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this step by step and really explore the thought process behind solving this problem.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- This seems like a problem involving modular arithmetic, specifically looking at numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5.\n\n- My first instinct is to list out a few numbers from 1 to 100 and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\n- I think there might be a pattern here that could help simplify things. Maybe it's similar to determining every nth number where n is a cycle of 5.\n\n**Step-by-step Approach:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We need to find integers from 1 to 100 that, when divided by 5, give a remainder of 1.\n   - Start with smaller numbers to identify any patterns.\n\n2. **Initial Exploration:**\n   - Let\u2019s test a few small numbers: \n     - 1 divided by 5 gives a remainder of 1.\n     - 5 divided by 5 gives a remainder of 0.\n     - 6 divided by 5 gives a remainder of 1.\n\n   - Already, it seems like numbers like 1, 6, 11,... could be part of a repeating pattern. Let's find a pattern here.\n\n3. **Pattern Identification:**\n   - The sequence appears to be: 1, 6, 11, 16, ...\n   - This looks like an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 5.\n\n4. **Confirm the Sequence:**\n   - General formula: The numbers are in the form 5k + 1 (where \\( k \\) is an integer).\n   - Let's check if this covers the entire range up to 100:\n     - \\( 5k + 1 \\leq 100 \\Rightarrow 5k \\leq 99 \\Rightarrow k \\leq 19.8 \\)\n     - \\( k \\) must be an integer, so \\( k \\leq 19 \\).\n\n5. **List and Count the Numbers:**\n   - Numbers in the sequence from 1 to 100: 1, 6, 11, ..., 96.\n   - Since each adds 5 to the previous number, I suspect there might be a straightforward count here.\n\n6. **Finding Exact Number Count:**\n   - Starting number: 1 (This corresponds to the starting number: 5*0+1)\n   - Last number: 96 \n   - If I use the formula of arithmetic sequences, I can find the total count of terms:\n     - First term \\( a_1 = 1 \\)\n     - Last term \\( a_n = 96 \\)\n     - Common difference \\( d = 5 \\)\n     - Formula for the nth term: \\( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \\)\n     - \\( 96 = 1 + (n-1) \\times 5 \\)\n     - \\( 95 = (n-1) \\times 5 \\)\n     - \\( n-1 = 19 \\)\n     - \\( n = 20 \\)\n\n7. **Percentage Calculation:**\n   - There are 20 numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 in the range from 1 to 100.\n   - Total numbers in the range: 100\n   - Percentage: \\( \\frac{20}{100} \\times 100\\% = 20\\% \\)\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- This approach checks out logically. Initially, I found the pattern using direct computation and arithmetic sequence principles, and I validated it mathematically. The answer seems reasonable, given the uniform distribution of remainders when numbers are divided by 5.\n\n- Concluding, the solution feels robust and correct: 20% of the integers from 1 to 100 leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5.\n\n**Checks and Insights:**\n\n- I'm happy with the method \u2014 everything aligns correctly numerically and logically.\n- Insight: The process became clearer when I saw it as a cyclic, repeating pattern influenced by the divisor.\n- Another check would be to count manually or change the divisor: if I changed 5 to another easy number like 3, I'd change the approach similarly.\n\nAnd that's my thought process!",

  "ground_truth": "The integers from 1 to 100 that leave a remainder of 1 are 1, 6, 11, $\\dots$, 96.  If we subtract 1 from each of these numbers, we get 0, 5, 10, $\\dots$, 95.  If we divide each of these numbers by 5, then we get 0, 1, 2, $\\dots$, 19.  Finally, if we add 1 to each of these numbers, then we get 1, 2, 3, $\\dots$, 20.  Therefore, the number of terms in 1, 6, 11, $\\dots$, 96 is the same as the number of terms in 1, 2, 3, $\\dots$, 20, which is $\\boxed{20}$.  (This number is the same as the percentage since we are dealing with 100 numbers.)"
