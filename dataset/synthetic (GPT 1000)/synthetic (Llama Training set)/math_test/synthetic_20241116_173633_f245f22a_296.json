    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\nOkay, so we have two lines, line \\( l \\) with equation \\( y = 4x - 7 \\), and line \\( m \\) with equation \\( y = ax + b \\). I notice that line \\( m \\) is perpendicular to line \\( l \\) and they intersect at \\( (2, 1) \\).\n\nWhen I see a problem involving perpendicular lines, it reminds me that I should think about slopes. Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other.\n\nLet's start breaking down what we know:\n\n1. The slope of line \\( l \\) is 4 because it's in the form \\( y = mx + c \\) where \\( m \\) is the slope.\n2. Line \\( m \\) is perpendicular to line \\( l \\), so its slope \\( a \\) should be the negative reciprocal of 4. This is something I've done before, so I should just divide and change signs: \\( a = -\\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nNext steps:\n\n\"Wait, there's a point of intersection at \\((2, 1)\\), so line \\( m \\) must also pass through this point. This gives us a way to determine the value of \\( b \\).\" \n\nLet's substitute \\( (2, 1) \\) into the equation for line \\( m \\):\n\n- Substitute the slope \\( a = -\\frac{1}{4} \\) and the point \\( (2, 1) \\) into the equation:\n\\[ 1 = -\\frac{1}{4}(2) + b \\]\n\n3. Calculating that gives: \n\\[ 1 = -\\frac{2}{4} + b \\]\n\\[ 1 = -\\frac{1}{2} + b \\]\n\nAt this point, I should solve for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\\[ b = \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nWe have \\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\nWait, let me quickly re-iterate this:\n- Slope \\( a = -\\frac{1}{4} \\) seems right as it's the negative reciprocal of 4.\n- Using \\( (2, 1) \\), solving for \\( b \\) seemed correct as well.\n\nOkay, with line \\( m \\) fully defined as \\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{3}{2} \\): \n\nNow to the other requirement:\n\n- Find the \\( y \\)-coordinate when \\( x = 6 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 6 \\) into the equation of \\( m \\):\n\n\\[ y = -\\frac{1}{4}(6) + \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\n4. Calculating:\n\n\\[ y = -\\frac{6}{4} + \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\\[ y = -\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\\[ y = 0 \\]\n\nWait, double-check:\n\n- When \\( x = 6 \\),\n  \\[ y = -\\frac{1}{4}\\times 6 + \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n  \\[ y = -\\frac{6}{4} + \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n  \\[ y = -\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n  \\[ y = 0 \\]\n\nReflection:\n\n\"After recalculating a few times and verifying the application of the method, the \\( y \\)-coordinate for \\( x = 6 \\) on line \\( m \\) is indeed 0. This makes sense based on my steps earlier. Feels good that it fits together nicely after checking!\"\n\nFinal answer: The \\( y \\)-coordinate of the point on line \\( m \\) when \\( x = 6 \\) is 0.",

  "ground_truth": "We find the equation of $m$ first. Since it is perpendicular to $l$, its slope must be $-1\\times(4)^{-1}$. Thus $a = -1/4$. Since $m$ also passes through the point $(2,1)$, we can find the equation of line $m$ by substituting 2 for $x$ and $1$ for $y$ in $m$'s point-slope form: $1 = 2\\times-\\frac{1}{4} + t$, where $(0,t)$ is the $y$-intercept of $m$. $t = \\frac{3}{2}$. Thus, at $x = 6$, the equation of line $m$ has y value $-6\\times\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{2} = \\boxed{0}$."
