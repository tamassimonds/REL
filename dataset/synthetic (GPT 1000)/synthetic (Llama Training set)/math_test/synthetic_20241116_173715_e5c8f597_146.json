    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The question states that the sum of two numbers is 25, and their difference is 11. We're tasked with finding the larger of the two numbers. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- This seems like a classic system of equations problem. I remember working on problems where I had two conditions to find two unknowns. The straightforward way is usually setting up equations based on the given information.\n- Two numbers... sum of 25... difference of 11... immediately makes me think of using variables to represent these unknown numbers.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Let's call the two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), where \\( x \\) is the larger number.\n- If their sum is 25: \\( x + y = 25 \\).\n- If their difference is 11: \\( x - y = 11 \\).\n- This looks familiar; these are two linear equations in two variables. Solving such systems generally involves either substitution or elimination.\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Elimination Method:**\n   - This method can work if I can eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting equations.\n   - Let's add the two equations:\n     \\[\n     (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11\n     \\]\n     \\[ \n     2x = 36\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 18\n     \\]\n   - That was smooth, and it seems right but let\u2019s confirm this makes sense by finding \\( y \\).\n\n2. **Substitution Method:**\n   - Another approach is substituting one equation into another.\n   - From the second equation (\\( x - y = 11 \\)), express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\): \\( x = y + 11 \\).\n   - Substitute into the first equation (\\( x + y = 25 \\)):\n     \\[\n     (y + 11) + y = 25\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2y + 11 = 25\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2y = 14\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = 7\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( y = 7 \\) back into \\( x = y + 11 \\):\n     \\[\n     x = 7 + 11 = 18\n     \\]\n   - Both methods confirm that the larger number is 18.\n\n**Reflecting:**\n- The approach using elimination was straightforward, and checking it with substitution aligns, which boosts confidence in the solution.\n- It's always good practice to check if the result makes sense. Plugging back:\n  - Sum check: \\( 18 + 7 = 25 \\) \u2713\n  - Difference check: \\( 18 - 7 = 11 \\) \u2713\n- The numbers work perfectly with the given conditions, which signals we're correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The larger number is 18. Everything steps in line logically and mathematically accurate, so I feel confident about this solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x,y$ be the two numbers, $x>y$. Then $x+y=25$ and $x-y=11$, thus:\n\n$x=\\frac{1}{2}\\left((x+y)+(x-y)\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}(25+11)=\\boxed{18}$."
