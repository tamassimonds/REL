    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We are tasked with factoring the quadratic expression \\(-35 - x + 12x^2\\), knowing that one of the factors is \\((3x + 5)\\). We need to find the other factor. Let's break this down step by step, like we're solving it together.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nWhen I first look at this, the presence of a known factor \\((3x + 5)\\) suggests some sort of division or use of polynomial division could work. Hmm, decomposition might work too since it's similar to problems I've seen before where knowing one factor can help us find others. Let me try different approaches and see which makes the most sense.\n\n### Step-by-step Approach\n\n#### Step 1: Rewriting the Expression\n- The polynomial is given in a somewhat unusual order: \\(-35 - x + 12x^2\\). I prefer to write quadratics in standard form, so I'll rewrite it as: \n  \\[\n  12x^2 - x - 35\n  \\]\n\n#### Step 2: Thinking about Division\n- Since \\((3x + 5)\\) is a factor, if we divide \\(12x^2 - x - 35\\) by \\((3x + 5)\\), the quotient should be the missing factor. Let's perform polynomial division:\n  \n#### Division Process\n1. Consider the first terms: divide \\(12x^2\\) by \\(3x\\) to get \\(4x\\).\n2. Multiply \\(4x\\) with \\((3x + 5)\\) giving \\(12x^2 + 20x\\).\n3. Subtract \\((12x^2 + 20x)\\) from \\((12x^2 - x)\\) gives a remainder: \n   \\[\n   -21x\n   \\]\n4. Bring down the \\(-35\\) to make it \\(-21x - 35\\).\n5. Divide \\(-21x\\) by \\(3x\\) to get \\(-7\\).\n6. Multiply \\(-7\\) with \\((3x + 5)\\) giving \\(-21x - 35\\).\n7. Subtracting gives a remainder of 0, signaling that the division process was correctly done.\n\n- Through this method, we find the other factor is \\((4x - 7)\\).\n\n#### Step 3: Verification\n- To verify, let's multiply the factors back and check if we get the original quadratic:\n  \\[\n  (3x + 5)(4x - 7) = 3x(4x) + 3x(-7) + 5(4x) + 5(-7)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 12x^2 - 21x + 20x - 35 = 12x^2 - x - 35\n  \\]\n- It looks like it matches our original quadratic, so \\((4x - 7)\\) is indeed the other factor.\n\n### Conclusion\nThrough step-by-step polynomial division and verification via multiplication, we determined the missing factor paired with \\((3x + 5)\\) is \\((4x - 7)\\). Reflecting on the whole process ensures I followed the right steps and provided the correct solution. Polynomial division helped break this down efficiently, aligning with the problem's needs. Sometimes exploring multiple strategies gives confidence in landing the correct result, and division worked well here given the linear factor.",

  "ground_truth": "Given that we have $- 35 - x + 12x^2$ and the factor $3x + 5$, we can guess that the other factor must be $4x - 7$ since the linear terms must multiply to $12x^2$ and the constant terms must multiply to $-35.$\n\nExpanding, we can verify that this is correct, and therefore our answer is $\\boxed{(4x - 7)}.$"
