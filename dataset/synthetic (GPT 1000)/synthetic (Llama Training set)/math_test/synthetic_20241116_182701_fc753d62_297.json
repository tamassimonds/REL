    "working_out": "First thoughts:  \nThe problem is asking for the length of the long diagonal of a box where the sides are the roots \\( r, s, \\) and \\( t \\) of the given cubic equation. My first instinct is to recall the formula for the diagonal of a rectangular box. It's similar to using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions.\n\nOkay, let's break it down into smaller pieces:\n\n1. **Understand the formula for the box's diagonal**:  \n   The length of the diagonal \\( d \\) of a box with edge lengths \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\) can be given by the formula:  \n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\n   \\]\n   Here \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\) are the roots \\( r, s, \\) and \\( t \\) of the cubic equation. So the task really boils down to finding \\( \\sqrt{r^2 + s^2 + t^2} \\).\n\n2. **Handle roots of the cubic equation**:  \n   The roots \\( r, s, \\) and \\( t \\) are found in the equation:\n   \\[\n   x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - \\frac{19}{10} = 0\n   \\]\n   To find \\( r^2 + s^2 + t^2 \\), I can use the identity:\n   \\[\n   r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = (r+s+t)^2 - 2(rs+rt+st)\n   \\]\n   So, I need these sums.\n\n3. **Apply Vieta's formulas**:  \n   Vieta's formulas give relationships between the coefficients of a polynomial and sums/products of its roots. For a cubic equation \\( x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0 \\), the relationships are:\n   - \\( r + s + t = -\\text{(coefficient of } x^2) \\)\n   - \\( rs + rt + st = \\text{(coefficient of } x) \\)\n   - \\( rst = -\\text{constant term} \\)\n\n   Applying these to our equation:\n   - \\( r + s + t = 4 \\)\n   - \\( rs + rt + st = 5 \\)\n   - \\( rst = \\frac{19}{10} \\)\n\n4. **Calculate \\( r^2 + s^2 + t^2 \\)**:  \n   Use the identity:\n   \\[\n   r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = (r+s+t)^2 - 2(rs+rt+st)\n   \\]\n   Plug in the values:  \n   \\[\n   r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = 4^2 - 2 \\times 5 = 16 - 10 = 6\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the diagonal length**:  \n   Now substitute back into the formula for the diagonal \\( d \\):\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{r^2 + s^2 + t^2} = \\sqrt{6}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final reflection and double-check**:  \n   Overall, I feel confident this is correct because I've applied Vieta\u2019s formulas and the identity correctly to find the sum of the squares. An alternative method might involve solving the cubic for its actual roots, but this indirect method should work for a problem of this form. It\u2019s concise and typically used when only needing specific symmetric functions of the roots like this. \n\nTherefore, the length of the long diagonal of the box is \\(\\sqrt{6}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The length of the long diagonal is $\\sqrt{r^2 + s^2 + t^2}.$\n\nBy Vieta's formulas, $r + s + t = 4$ and $rs + rt + st = 5.$  Squaring the equation $r + s + t = 4,$ we get\n\\[r^2 + s^2 + t^2 + 2(rs + rt + st) = 16.\\]Then $r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = 16 - 2(rs + rt + st) = 6,$ so $\\sqrt{r^2 + s^2 + t^2} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{6}}.$"
