    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. \n\nFirst Thoughts: \nWhen I first look at this, I'm seeing two functions, \\( f(x) = 2x + 1 \\) and \\( g(x) = -3 \\). It seems like they want us to find \\( f(g(x)) \\), which suggests we're dealing with function composition. This reminds me of similar function composition problems where we substitute the output of one function into another.\n\nInitial Strategy:\n1. We need to substitute \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\). \n2. Since \\( g(x) = -3 \\), no matter what \\( x \\) is, \\( g(x) \\) always outputs \\(-3\\). \n3. So, plugging \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\) means substituting \\(-3\\) into the \\( f \\) function.\n\nExecuting the Strategy:\n- Let's express \\( f(g(x)) \\) in terms of known functions. We want \\( f(g(x)) = f(-3) \\).\n\n- Now, calculate \\( f(-3) \\) using the function \\( f(x) = 2x + 1 \\):\n  \\[\n  f(-3) = 2(-3) + 1\n  \\]\n  - Calculating that: \\( 2 \\times -3 = -6 \\).\n  - Add 1 to \\(-6\\): \\(-6 + 1 = -5\\).\n\nChecking Work:\n- The calculation of \\( 2(-3) + 1 \\) seemed straightforward, but I want to ensure I didn't skip a logical step. \n- Okay, the steps feel right: plugging \\(-3\\) into the equation, multiplying, then adding.\n- Yes, this outcome looks reasonable. The function \\( f(x) = 2x + 1 \\) modifies numbers by doubling them (hence making them more negative too) and adding one, linearly.\n\nFinal Answer:\n- Through the steps and verification, I've concluded that \\( f(g(x)) = -5 \\).\n\nReflecting on the Approach:\n- Overall, the problem was a matter of correctly performing the composition of functions and evaluating at a constant value.\n- I was able to stick with my initial strategy, and it effectively led me to the solution.\n- This makes sense with function composition since \\( g(x) \\) is constant, reducing the complexity.\n\nIf this were incorrect, my next step would involve re-checking substituting steps or reconsidering what \\( g(x) \\) contributes to the evaluation context. However, I feel confident in this result.",
