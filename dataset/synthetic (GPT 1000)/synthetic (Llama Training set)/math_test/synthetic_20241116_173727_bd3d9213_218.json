    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The equation we're dealing with is \\(\\sqrt[3]{4x^2} = 4\\). I need to find all possible values of \\(x\\) that satisfy this equation, listing them from least to greatest. Let's brainstorm some potential strategies and lay out our steps clearly as we go.\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Brainstorming:\n- **First glance:** The equation involves a cube root. It seems like a straightforward operation to resolve the expression and see what \\(x\\) might be.\n- **Strategy Options:**\n  1. **Eliminate the cube root** by cubing both sides. This should simplify the expressions and help solve for \\(x\\).\n  2. **Reflect on potential multiple solutions**: Especially consider positive and negative roots, since squaring might introduce multiple possibilities for \\(x\\).\n\nLet's proceed with the first strategy\u2014cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution:\n1. **Remove the cube root:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\sqrt[3]{4x^2}\\right)^3 = 4^3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4x^2 = 64\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 4:**\n   \\[\n   x^2 = \\frac{64}{4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 16\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   - \\(x\\) could be either the positive or negative square root of 16.\n   \\[\n   x = \\pm \\sqrt{16}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\pm 4\n   \\]\n\nThis results in two possible values: \\(x = 4\\) and \\(x = -4\\).\n\n### Checking the Answer:\n- **Substitute back to ensure both values satisfy the original equation:**\n\n  1. **For \\(x = 4\\):**\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt[3]{4 \\times 4^2} = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4\n     \\]\n     This satisfies the equation.\n  \n  2. **For \\(x = -4\\):**\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt[3]{4 \\times (-4)^2} = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4\n     \\]\n     This also satisfies the equation.\n\n### Reflection:\n- Both values work! The original approach was correct. Number and logical checks affirm that nothing was overlooked, and both results appear in our checks.\n\n### Final Answer:\n- List the possible values of \\(x\\) from least to greatest: \n  \\[\n  x = -4, x = 4\n  \\]\n\nEverything seems consistent, and based on our steps, these should be the correct solutions to the problem.",

  "ground_truth": "In order to get rid of the cube root, we start by cubing the both sides of the equation \\begin{align*} (\\sqrt[3]{4x^2})^3&=(4)^3\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 4x^2& =64\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x^2& =16\n\\end{align*}From here, we can see that the only possible values of $x$ are 4 and -4. Since the question asked to list them from least to greatest, the final answer is $\\boxed{-4, 4}$."
