    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n**First thoughts:** \nThis equation represents a circle, based on its format \\(x^2 + 6x + y^2 + 8y = 0\\). This looks similar to problems where you have to find features of a circle from its equation, like the center and radius. \n\n**What I know:** \nGenerally, a circle's equation has the form \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius. \n\n**Guess:** \nTo find the center, we probably need to manipulate the given equation into this standard form.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Equation\n**Second thought:** \nCompleting the square seems like a promising approach because that\u2019s a classic method for bringing conic sections into a standard form. \n\n#### Completing the square:\n1. **Focus on the x terms:**\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 6x\n   \\]\n   To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\), square it, and add/subtract: \n   - Half of 6 is 3. \n   - Square it: \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n\n   Add and subtract 9: \n   \\[\n   x^2 + 6x = (x+3)^2 - 9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Focus on the y terms:**\n   \\[\n   y^2 + 8y \n   \\]\n   Similarly, half of 8 is 4, and \\(4^2 = 16\\). \n\n   Add and subtract 16: \n   \\[\n   y^2 + 8y = (y+4)^2 - 16\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Rewrite in Completed Square Form\nCombine these into the original equation:\n\\[\n(x+3)^2 - 9 + (y+4)^2 - 16 = 0\n\\]\n\nCombine the constants and rearrange:\n\\[\n(x+3)^2 + (y+4)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Center and Radius\n**Quick check:** \nThis looks like the standard circle equation form \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\). Here, \\((x+3)^2 + (y+4)^2 = 25\\), which matches \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = 5^2\\).\n\n**So, the center is:** \n\\((-3, -4)\\), and the radius is 5.\n\n### Step 5: Solve the Final Question\n**Find the sum of the coordinates of the center:** \nSimply add the x and y coordinates of the center:\n\\[\n-3 + (-4) = -7\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:** \nThis approach looks good. The steps logically lead me through modifying the equation into a recognizable form. I didn\u2019t encounter any contradictions or peculiar results. \n\nThe sum of the coordinates is \\(-7\\). This seems correct given my work. Overall, I am confident with this solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We complete the square for the equation by observing that the given equation is equivalent to \\[\n(x^2+6x+9)+(y^2+8y+16)=25,\n\\] so the equation for the circle becomes \\[\n(x+3)^2 +(y+4)^2 =5^2.\n\\]  Hence, the center is $(-3,-4)$ which implies that the answer is $-3-4 =\\boxed{-7}$."
