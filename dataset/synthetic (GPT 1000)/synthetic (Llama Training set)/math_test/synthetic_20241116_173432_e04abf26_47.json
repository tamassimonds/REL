    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. \n\n### Understanding the Problem:\n\nFirst, let's process what the problem is asking. We need to find the value of \\( x \\) for which two rational expressions are equal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x - 1}{2x + 2} = \\frac{x - 3}{x - 1}\n\\]\n\nThis looks like a classic algebra problem involving setting two rational expressions equal and solving for \\( x \\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n\nThe problem reminds me of solving equations where fractions are equal, and typically we could eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying. This method seems to make sense here because we have two expressions set equal to each other. But, before diving right into cross-multiplication, let's think about other potential approaches, like simplifying or checking for undefined values.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies:\n\n1. **Cross-Multiplication:** This is often the quickest way to eliminate the fractions. Involves multiplying the numerator of each fraction by the denominator of the other.\n\n2. **Simplification:** Simplify each fraction first if possible, to see if there's a more straightforward form of the equation.\n\n3. **Checking for Undefined Values:** It's critical to ensure we don't multiply or divide by zero. For both fractions, identify values of \\( x \\) that make the denominators zero.\n\n### Check for Undefined Values:\n\n- The denominator of the first fraction is \\( 2x + 2 \\), which is zero when \\( x = -1 \\).\n- The denominator of the second fraction is \\( x - 1 \\), which is zero when \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\) are points where the expressions are undefined. Let's keep these in mind as potential restrictions.\n\n### Simplifying the Expressions:\n\n- First expression: \\(\\frac{2x - 1}{2x + 2}\\)\n\nThis can be rewritten by factoring the denominator: \n\\[\n2x + 2 = 2(x + 1)\n\\]\n\n- Second expression: \\(\\frac{x - 3}{x - 1}\\)\n\nNo simplification appears here, but good to check.\n\n### Let's Try Cross-Multiplication:\n\nSince direct simplification didn't reveal any cancellations, cross-multiplying will help:\n\n\\[\n(2x - 1)(x - 1) = (x - 3)(2x + 2)\n\\]\n\n### Expanding Both Sides:\n\n1. **Left Side:**\n\n\\[\n(2x - 1)(x - 1) = 2x(x - 1) - 1(x - 1) = 2x^2 - 2x - x + 1 = 2x^2 - 3x + 1\n\\]\n\n2. **Right Side:**\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)(2x + 2) = x(2x + 2) - 3(2x + 2) = 2x^2 + 2x - 6x - 6 = 2x^2 - 4x - 6\n\\]\n\n### Equating and Solving:\n\nNow set both expanded forms equal to each other:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 3x + 1 = 2x^2 - 4x - 6\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\(2x^2\\) from both sides (they cancel out), resulting in:\n\n\\[\n-3x + 1 = -4x - 6\n\\]\n\nAdd \\(4x\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\nx + 1 = -6\n\\]\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = -7\n\\]\n\n### Checking the Solution:\n\nFinally, verify if \\( x = -7 \\) leads to a true statement in the original equation and ensures no division by zero in initial expressions:\n\n- Substitute \\( x = -7 \\) back into either expression:\n\nFirst expression: \\(\\frac{2(-7) - 1}{2(-7) + 2} = \\frac{-15}{-12}\\)\n\nSecond expression: \\(\\frac{-7 - 3}{-7 - 1} = \\frac{-10}{-8}\\)\n\nBoth reduce to \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\), hence the solution satisfies the initial equality. Furthermore, it does not make any denominator zero, thus it is valid.\n\nSo, the answer is \\(\\boxed{-7}\\).",
