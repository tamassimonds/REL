    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving the equation \\(2k + 5 = 13\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst thing's first, I need to understand what the equation is asking me to find. The equation \\(2k + 5 = 13\\) is asking me to find the value of \\(k\\) that makes this equation true. Alright, I've done similar problems before, but let's see how to approach this one.\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorming Different Strategies\nThere are a few ways to solve for \\(k\\), and I want to consider them before diving in:\n\n1. **Isolate the variable:** This typically involves performing operations to get \\(k\\) by itself on one side of the equation. I'm familiar with this from algebra.\n\n2. **Substitution or guessing:** Though usually more time-consuming, I could try guessing values for \\(k\\) until the equation checks out. Not efficient here.\n\n3. **Balancing method or inverse operations:** Use the inverse operations to keep the equation balanced while simplifying it.\n\nGiven these options, isolating the variable (method 1) seems the most straightforward here.\n\n### Step 3: Isolating the Variable\nLet's try to isolate \\(k\\):\n\n- The equation is \\(2k + 5 = 13\\). To get \\(k\\) by itself, I should start by eliminating the constant term on the left side, which is \\(5\\).\n\n- **Subtract 5 from both sides:** This gives me \\(2k + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5\\).\n\n- Simplify both sides: So, it becomes \\(2k = 8\\).\n\n### Step 4: Solving for \\(k\\)\nNow I need to isolate \\(k\\):\n\n- **Divide by 2:** Since \\(2k\\) means \\(2\\) times \\(k\\), I can divide both sides by \\(2\\) to solve for \\(k\\).\n\n- Doing that gives me \\(\\frac{2k}{2} = \\frac{8}{2}\\).\n\n- Simplify: \\(k = 4\\).\n\n### Step 5: Checking My Work\nI want to ensure this solution is correct:\n\n- Substitute back into the original equation: \\(2k + 5 = 13\\).\n\n- Use \\(k = 4\\): Replace \\(k\\) with \\(4\\): \\(2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13\\).\n\n- It checks out since the equation holds true.\n\n### Step 6: Reflecting\nThe solution appears correct. The steps I used were straightforward and based on isolating the variable, which is a standard technique in algebra for solving linear equations. Everything worked out smoothly without needing to shift strategies.\n\nNo guesswork or alternative methods were needed beyond verifying the answer with substitution. This problem reminded me how vital it is to methodically apply inverse operations to maintain the balance in equations.\n\nFinally, I'm confident that \\(k = 4\\) is indeed the correct solution to the equation \\(2k + 5 = 13\\).",
