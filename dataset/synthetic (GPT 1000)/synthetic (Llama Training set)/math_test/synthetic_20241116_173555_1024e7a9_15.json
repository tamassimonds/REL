    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. Initially, it seems we're dealing with some basic modular arithmetic. Let's break it down carefully and see where it leads us.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst things first, what the problem is essentially asking is, given a number `n` such that when `n` is divided by 5, the remainder is 3, we need to find the remainder when twice that number is divided by 5. So, I'm thinking this has something to do with the properties of numbers and remainders, which is sometimes called modular arithmetic.\n\n### Step 2: Expressing the Problem Mathematically\nLet\u2019s denote the number as `n`. According to the problem's conditions:\n\n- When `n` is divided by 5, it leaves a remainder of 3.\n- Mathematically, this can be expressed as:  \n  \\[\n  n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}\n  \\]\n  This essentially means `n` can be written in the form of `5k + 3` where `k` is some integer.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Twice the Number\nNow, we need to find out what happens when `2n` is divided by 5. If `n` is expressed in modular terms, then:\n  \\[\n  2n \\equiv 2 \\times 3 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{5}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplification\n- Taking it a step further, as 6 is greater than 5, we divide it by 5 to find the remainder:\n  \\[\n  6 \\div 5 = 1 \\, \\text{R} \\, 1\n  \\]\n  So, in modular terms, 6 is congruent to 1 mod 5. Thus, we can rewrite:\n  \\[\n  2n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 5: Reflect and Verify\n- Let's just double check quickly if this makes sense. If `n` was, for example, the simplest case of 3 (since 3 mod 5 does indeed equal 3), then `2n` or 6 divided by 5 yields a remainder of 1. This checks out.\n- Reviewing the calculations, it seems to make sense. \n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n- After working through it and checking the logic, the remainder when twice the number is divided by 5 is indeed 1.\n\nReflecting on the problem-solving process, it feels right. We defined `n` in terms of modular arithmetic, doubled it, and then reduced modulo 5 again. The approach was sound and the calculations were straightforward. This matches the typical steps you'd follow in a modular arithmetic problem like this. \n\nSo, the remainder when twice the number is divided by 5 is:\n\\[ \n\\boxed{1} \n\\]",
