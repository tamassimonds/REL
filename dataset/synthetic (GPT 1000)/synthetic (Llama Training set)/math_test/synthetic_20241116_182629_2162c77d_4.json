    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and take it step-by-step. \n\n**Initial Thoughts**\n\n1. The equation given is \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{x + 2} = 125^{-x}\\).\n2. This looks like a problem I\u2019ve seen before\u2014solving an equation where both sides are written as powers. My initial thought is to focus on expressing each side with the same base if possible, which might make it easier to solve.\n\n**Understanding the Equation**\n\n3. \\(\\frac{1}{25}\\) can be rewritten as \\(25^{-1}\\). Since \\(25 = 5^2\\), this is the same as \\((5^2)^{-1} = 5^{-2}\\).\n4. Similarly, \\(125\\) can be rewritten as \\(5^3\\) because \\(125 = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5\\).\n5. So the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   (5^{-2})^{x + 2} = (5^3)^{-x}\n   \\]\n\n**Exploring the Equation Further**\n\n6. Now that both sides have the base 5, I can use the property of exponents that \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\) to simplify:\n   - The left side becomes \\(5^{-2(x + 2)}\\).\n   - The right side becomes \\(5^{-3x}\\).\n\n7. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   5^{-2(x + 2)} = 5^{-3x}\n   \\]\n\n**Solving for \\(x\\)**\n\n8. Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   -2(x + 2) = -3x\n   \\]\n\n9. Let\u2019s expand the left side: \n   \\[\n   -2x - 4 = -3x\n   \\]\n\n10. Now, I\u2019ll solve for \\(x\\) by adding \\(2x\\) to both sides:\n    \\[\n    -4 = -3x + 2x\n    \\]\n\n11. Simplify:\n    \\[\n    -4 = -x\n    \\]\n\n12. Finally, multiply both sides by \\(-1\\) to get:\n    \\[\n    x = 4\n    \\]\n\n**Verification**\n\n13. Let's check if \\(x = 4\\) is correct by substituting it back into the original equation:\n    - On the left side: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{4 + 2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^6 = 25^{-6} = (5^2)^{-6} = 5^{-12}\\).\n\n    - On the right side: \\(125^{-4} = (5^3)^{-4} = 5^{-12}\\).\n\n14. Both sides equal \\(5^{-12}\\), which means our solution \\(x = 4\\) is indeed correct.\n\n**Reflection**\n\n15. I really focused on transforming the terms into a common base, which helped simplify the problem significantly. The translation from powers of one number to another makes these problems more approachable by reducing complexity using similar forms. This definitely validated our approach and ensured that we derived a consistent result through logical steps.\n\nThe answer is \\(x = 4\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Rewriting both sides with $5$ as the base, we have $\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{x + 2} = (5^{-2})^{x+2} = 5^{-2x - 4}$, and $125^{-x} = (5^3)^{-x} = 5^{-3x}$, which means our equation is: $$5^{-2x - 4} = 5^{-3x}.$$Then, by setting the exponents equal to each other, we obtain $$-2x - 4 = -3x.$$This yields our solution $\\boxed{x = 4}$"
