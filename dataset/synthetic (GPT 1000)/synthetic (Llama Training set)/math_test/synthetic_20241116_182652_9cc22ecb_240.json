    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about an arithmetic sequence. I'm thinking about how to tackle this, and there are a few pieces to start with.\n\n### First Thoughts\n1. **Identify Key Concepts**: We're dealing with an arithmetic sequence, which means there's a constant difference between consecutive terms.\n2. **Given Information**: \n   - The first term equals the third term minus the second term.\n   - The fourth term is $8$.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Sequence\nIf I remember correctly, an arithmetic sequence has terms \\( a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, \\ldots \\), where \\( a \\) is the first term, and \\( d \\) is the common difference.\n\n### Step 2: Express the Given Conditions Using Formulas\n- **Condition 1**: The first term equals the third term minus the second term. \n  - Third term: \\( a+2d \\)\n  - Second term: \\( a+d \\)\n  - The condition gives: \\( a = (a+2d) - (a+d) \\)\n\n- **Condition 2**: The fourth term is \\(8\\).\n  - Fourth term: \\( a+3d = 8 \\)\n\n### Hmm... Let's Simplify Condition 1\nRealizing this might simplify:\n\\[\na = (a + 2d) - (a + d) \\implies a = 2d - d = d\n\\]\nThis tells me that the first term \\( a \\) equals the common difference \\( d \\). \n\n### Step 3: Use Condition 2\nSince \\( a = d \\), substitute into the second condition:\n\\[\na + 3d = 8 \\implies d + 3d = 8 \\implies 4d = 8\n\\]\n\n### Solve for \\( d \\)\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\\[\nd = 2\n\\]\nIt follows that the first term \\( a \\) is also \\( 2 \\) since \\( a = d \\).\n\n### Re-evaluate to Ensure Correctness\n- Let's think through it again quickly to double-check:\n  - If \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( d = 2 \\), the sequence starts like this: \\( 2, 4, 6, 8, \\ldots \\)\n  - First term: \\( 2 \\)\n  - Second term: \\( 4 \\)\n  - Third term: \\( 6 \\) \n  - Fourth term: \\( 8 \\)\n\n- The initial condition holds because: \n  \\[\n  a = (a + 2d) - (a + d) \\Rightarrow 2 = 6 - 4 = 2 \n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nEverything checks out. The first term is definitely \\( 2 \\).\n\nI feel confident that this is the correct answer. It's nice when everything fits together tidily.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $d$ be the common difference.  We told that the first term is equal to the third term minus the second term, so the first term is equal to $d$.  Then the second term is equal to $2d$, the third term is equal to $3d$, and the fourth term is equal to $4d = 8$.  Hence, the first term is $d = \\boxed{2}$."
