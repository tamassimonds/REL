    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We have four positive real numbers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) and we want to find the minimum value of the expression:\n\n\\[\n(a + b + c + d) \\left( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d} \\right).\n\\]\n\nThis sort of expression often reminds me of inequalities like the AM-GM inequality or Hoelder's inequality, which might be helpful. Let's take a step-by-step approach and explore different strategies.\n\n### Step 1: Explore Symmetry and AM-GM Inequality\n\nFirst, there's a certain symmetry in the expression \\( (a + b + c + d) \\left( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d} \\right) \\). The structure is reminiscent of the product \\( (x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n)(y_1 + y_2 + \\cdots + y_n) \\) where each \\( y_i = \\frac{1}{x_i} \\).\n\nThe AM-GM inequality provides a neat way to handle sums and products:\n\n- The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative reals, the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean. Specifically, for our variables:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{a+b+c+d}{4} \\ge \\sqrt[4]{abcd}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d}}{4} \\ge \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{1}{abcd}}\n  \\]\n\nMy initial thought is to apply AM-GM directly to the whole expression, or consider values where the symmetry might reduce the complexity.\n\n### Step 2: Try Equal Values for Symmetry\n\nGiven the symmetry and the way inequalities often tighten around equal variables, it's worth checking what happens if \\(a = b = c = d\\). Let's denote this common value as \\(x\\).\n\n\\[\na + b + c + d = 4x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d} = \\frac{4}{x}\n\\]\n\nThen our expression becomes:\n\\[\n(4x) \\left( \\frac{4}{x} \\right) = 16\n\\]\n\nThis quick evaluation suggests that 16 might be the minimum value. But it's crucial to backtrack and ensure it holds under other arrangements.\n\n### Step 3: Check Using Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality\n\nCauchy-Schwarz inequality might be useful for additional verification:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) \\left( \\frac{1}{a^2} + \\frac{1}{b^2} + \\frac{1}{c^2} + \\frac{1}{d^2} \\right) \\ge (1 + 1 + 1 + 1)^2 = 16\n\\]\n\nThis still supports that the minimum value can be 16. The structure \\( 16 \\) mentioned by using \\( x = x = x = x \\) seems to support correctness through symmetry as well.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nAfter verifying through substitutions, inequalities like AM-GM and Cauchy-Schwarz, the symmetry and equal values give both intuitional and formal checks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe minimum value of the expression \\((a + b + c + d) \\left( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d} \\right)\\), when \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) are equal, is indeed 16. \n\nThis problem uses symmetry effectively and leverages inequality concepts to check boundaries\u2014confirming that 16 is not just a bound, but actually achievable.",
