    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step, exploring different strategies along the way and reflecting on each step as we go.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\n\nMy first thought when seeing the equation \\(25x^2 + 4y^2 = 16\\) is that this is the equation of an ellipse. An ellipse can be written in the standard form \\(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes. This rings a bell from past problems related to conic sections. But wait, this isn't in the standard form yet, which means I'll need to do some rearranging.\n\n**Step 2: Convert to standard form**\n\nTo convert this to the standard form of an ellipse, I'll divide every term by 16 (the right-hand side):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{25x^2}{16} + \\frac{4y^2}{16} = 1\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{\\frac{16}{25}} + \\frac{y^2}{\\frac{16}{4}} = 1\n\\]\nor further simplifying,\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2} + \\frac{y^2}{2^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, it's in the standard form of an ellipse equation \\(\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\) with \\(a = \\frac{4}{5}\\) and \\(b = 2\\).\n\n**Step 3: Compute the area of the ellipse**\n\nOnce in this form, I remember from earlier geometry courses that the area \\(A\\) of an ellipse is given by the formula \\(A = \\pi \\times a \\times b\\). Here, \\(a = \\frac{4}{5}\\) and \\(b = 2\\).\n\nLet me calculate the area:\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\times \\frac{4}{5} \\times 2\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\times \\frac{8}{5}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{8}{5}\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Reflect and check the calculations**\n\nI should quickly review if this seems reasonable. The calculations were straightforward given the conversion to standard form was correctly done. A good quick check is to ensure that my manipulation of fractions while finding \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) made sense, which it does. The division by the right-side value (16) looks accurate, giving us an area that seems to be calculable this way.\n\nAlso, by recalling a past similar problem, the form and the multiplication of \\(\\pi\\) resulting in a rational multiplier is quite common when finding areas of transformed geometric shapes.\n\n**Step 5: Final check**\n\nBefore I conclude, let me reflect. The question posed needed an understanding of the properties of ellipses, particularly converting to standard form and using the correct formula for the area. Given the steps taken and the checks along the way, I am confident that \\(\\frac{8}{5}\\pi\\) is indeed the correct area of the ellipse described by the equation \\(25x^2 + 4y^2 = 16\\).\n\nOkay, that feels solid. I think we\u2019re good to go with the solution!",

  "ground_truth": "Dividing by 16 gives the standard form of the equation of this ellipse, \\[\\frac{x^2}{(\\frac{16}{25})} + \\frac{y^2}{4} = 1.\\]Then, the semimajor and semiminor axes have lengths $\\sqrt{4} = 2$ and $\\sqrt{\\tfrac{16}{25}} = \\tfrac45$. By the area formula for an ellipse, the area of the ellipse is $2 \\cdot \\tfrac45 \\cdot \\pi = \\boxed{\\tfrac{8\\pi}5}.$"
