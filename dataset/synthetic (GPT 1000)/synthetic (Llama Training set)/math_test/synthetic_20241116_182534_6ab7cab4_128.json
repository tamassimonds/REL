    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s tackle this problem together. The goal is to solve the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x + 3}{x - 4} - \\frac{2x - 8}{2x + 1} = 1.\n\\]\n\nFirst thoughts: Okay, so looking at this problem, it reminds me of the kind of algebraic fractions where a good strategy is to find a common denominator. But first, let\u2019s explore what we\u2019ve got going on. Each term is a fraction, and the right side is a simple 1. Hmm, finding a common denominator seems like the way to go because it will allow me to combine these fractions into one.\n\nLet\u2019s brainstorm how I might start:\n\n- I can try to get the fractions on the left side to have a common denominator, then simplify.\n- I could also explore multiplying through by a common denominator to clear the fractions entirely.\n\nLet me reflect for a second: Multiplying through to eliminate the fractions might make things a bit easier to manage, but it could lead to more complicated equations as well. However, because I'm dealing with two variables in the denominators, a common denominator could be cumbersome too. Tough choice\u2014let's start off by exploring the common denominator path.\n\n### Step 1: Find a Common Denominator\n\nThe denominators here are \\(x - 4\\) and \\(2x + 1\\). A common denominator would be the product of these two: \\((x - 4)(2x + 1)\\).\n\n### Step 2: Rewrite Each Term with the Common Denominator\n\nLet\u2019s start by rewriting each fraction with this common denominator:\n\n- For \\(\\frac{2x + 3}{x - 4}\\), multiply the top and bottom by \\(2x + 1\\).\n- For \\(\\frac{2x - 8}{2x + 1}\\), multiply the top and bottom by \\(x - 4\\).\n\nThis gives me:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(2x + 3)(2x + 1)}{(x - 4)(2x + 1)} - \\frac{(2x - 8)(x - 4)}{(x - 4)(2x + 1)} = 1.\n\\]\n\nHmm, this looks messier than I anticipated, but let's simplify it before deciding whether to backtrack.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify Each Numerator\n\nFirst, expand \\((2x + 3)(2x + 1)\\):\n- \\((2x)(2x) = 4x^2\\)\n- \\((2x)(1) = 2x\\)\n- \\((3)(2x) = 6x\\)\n- \\((3)(1) = 3\\)\n\nAll together: \\(4x^2 + 8x + 3\\)\n\nNext, expand \\((2x - 8)(x - 4)\\):\n- \\((2x)(x) = 2x^2\\)\n- \\((2x)(-4) = -8x\\)\n- \\((-8)(x) = -8x\\)\n- \\((-8)(-4) = 32\\)\n\nAll together: \\(2x^2 - 16x + 32\\)\n\n### Step 4: Substitute and Combine\n\nSubstitute these into the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x^2 + 8x + 3}{(x - 4)(2x + 1)} - \\frac{2x^2 - 16x + 32}{(x - 4)(2x + 1)} = 1.\n\\]\n\nCombine the numerators:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(4x^2 + 8x + 3) - (2x^2 - 16x + 32)}{(x - 4)(2x + 1)} = 1.\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[\n4x^2 + 8x + 3 - 2x^2 + 16x - 32 = 2x^2 + 24x - 29.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve the Equation\n\nNow, we solve:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x^2 + 24x - 29}{(x - 4)(2x + 1)} = 1.\n\\]\n\nCross multiply to clear the fraction:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 + 24x - 29 = (x - 4)(2x + 1).\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Expand and Simplify\n\nExpand the right-hand side: \n\n\\((x - 4)(2x + 1) = 2x^2 - 8x + x - 4 = 2x^2 - 7x - 4\\).\n\nSet the resulting equation:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 + 24x - 29 = 2x^2 - 7x - 4.\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\(2x^2\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n24x - 29 = -7x - 4.\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Isolate x\n\nAdd \\(7x\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\n24x + 7x = -4 + 29.\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n31x = 25.\n\\]\n\nFinally, divide by 31:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{25}{31}.\n\\]\n\nOkay, let's breathe for a second and check that all looks sane. Go back through substitution in original expressions to ensure balance. Keep in mind any restrictions (like \\(x \\neq 4\\) and \\(2x+1 \\neq 0\\), with no such breaks apparent in solution path). This seems to flow logically from start to finish. Patience paid off, and a thorough approach indeed was rewarded with an answer.",
