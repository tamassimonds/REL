    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into solving this problem step by step, capturing the messy, human thought process as we go.\n\n### Initial Understanding:\n- The question asks for the sixth term in a geometric sequence. A geometric sequence involves each term being a consistent multiple (the common ratio) of the previous term.\n- We're given the first three terms: \\(\\frac{27}{125}, \\frac{9}{25}, \\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\n### First Thoughts:\n- I notice that the sequence is likely fraction-based. \n- I can see a fractional pattern hinting that there's a common ratio.\n- I could calculate the common ratio, or just try to see patterns in the numerators and denominators separately.\n\n### Consider Possible Strategies:\n1. **Calculate the common ratio explicitly** by taking the ratio of the second term to the first.\n2. **Check the ratio continues consistently** into the third term.\n3. **Use the identified ratio to calculate the sixth term** based on sequential multiplication.\n\n### Calculating the Common Ratio:\n- To verify that the sequence is geometric, take the second term \\(\\frac{9}{25}\\) and divide it by the first term \\(\\frac{27}{125}\\).\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{\\frac{9}{25}}{\\frac{27}{125}} = \\frac{9}{25} \\times \\frac{125}{27} \n\\]\n\n- Simplifying this:\n\n\\[ \n= \\frac{9 \\times 125}{25 \\times 27} \n\\]\n\n- Breaking this down further:\n\n1. Simplify \\(\\frac{9}{27}\\) to get \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n2. Simplify \\(\\frac{125}{25}\\) to get \\(5\\).\n\n- Finally,\n\n\\[ \n= \\frac{1 \\times 5}{1 \\times 3} = \\frac{5}{3} \n\\]\n\n- So the common ratio is \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\).\n\n### Double Check:\n- Check with the third term:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{\\frac{3}{5}}{\\frac{9}{25}} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{25}{9} \n\\]\n\n1. Simplifying \\(\\frac{3}{9}\\) to get \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n2. Simplifying \\(\\frac{25}{5}\\) to get \\(5\\).\n\n\\[ \n= \\frac{1 \\times 5}{1 \\times 3} = \\frac{5}{3} \n\\]\n\n- Confirmed: the common ratio is consistent.\n\n### Calculate the Sixth Term:\n- We're steadily reaching towards finding the sixth term. We know the first term and the common ratio, so we apply the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term in a geometric sequence: \\(a_n = a_1 \\times r^{(n-1)}\\).\n\n\\[ \nn = 6, a_1 = \\frac{27}{125}, r = \\frac{5}{3} \n\\]\n\n\\[ \na_6 = \\frac{27}{125} \\times \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^5 \n\\]\n\n- Compute \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^5 = \\frac{5^5}{3^5} = \\frac{3125}{243}\\).\n\n\\[ \na_6 = \\frac{27}{125} \\times \\frac{3125}{243} \n\\]\n\n- Breaking it down:\n\n1. Simplify \\(\\frac{27}{243} = \\frac{1}{9}\\).\n2. Multiplication:\n\n\\[ \n= \\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{3125}{125} \n\\]\n\n- Further simplifying \\(\\frac{3125}{125} = 25\\):\n\n\\[ \n= \\frac{25}{9}\n\\]\n\n### Reflect and Verify:\n- Checks along the way have been positive regarding the consistency of the common ratio and operations.\n- Quick final assessment: Calculations seem small enough to be plausible within the continued progression of a geometric sequence. They align with previous terms in size.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe sixth term in the sequence is \\(\\frac{25}{9}\\).",
