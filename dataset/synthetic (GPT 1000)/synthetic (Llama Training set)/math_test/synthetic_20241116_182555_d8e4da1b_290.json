    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem. At a glance, this looks like it has something to do with polynomial division and root behavior since we're checking divisibility by \\((x + 1)^2\\). \n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- The polynomial \\(x^{2017} + Ax + B\\) being divisible by \\((x + 1)^2\\) suggests that \\(-1\\) is a root of multiplicity at least 2.\n- This reminds me of applying the factor theorem and its extension, which involves both evaluating the polynomial and its derivative at the root.\n\n#### Brainstorming:\n1. **Factor Theorem Insight**:\n   - If a polynomial \\(P(x)\\) is divisible by \\((x + 1)^2\\), it must be that \\((-1)\\) is a double root of \\(P(x)\\).\n   - This means \\(P(-1) = 0\\) and \\(P'(-1) = 0\\).\n\n2. **Polynomial Evaluation**:\n   - The given polynomial is \\(P(x) = x^{2017} + Ax + B\\).\n   - Let's start by evaluating \\(P(-1)\\):\n     \\[\n     P(-1) = (-1)^{2017} + A(-1) + B = -1 - A + B\n     \\]\n     For \\((-1)\\) to be a root, \\(P(-1) = 0\\), so:\n     \\(-1 - A + B = 0 \\Rightarrow B = A + 1\\).\n\n3. **Derivative Evaluation**:\n   - We need the derivative \\(P'(x)\\) for the second root condition:\n     \\[\n     P'(x) = 2017x^{2016} + A\n     \\]\n   - Evaluating the derivative at \\(-1\\):\n     \\[\n     P'(-1) = 2017(-1)^{2016} + A = 2017 + A\n     \\]\n     For \\((-1)\\) to be a root of the derivative as well, \\(P'(-1) = 0\\). Thus:\n     \\[\n     2017 + A = 0 \\Rightarrow A = -2017\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combining Results**:\n   - We found \\(A = -2017\\). Substituting back into \\(B = A + 1\\):\n     \\[\n     B = -2017 + 1 = -2016\n     \\]\n\n### Verification:\n- **Check P(-1) with A and B**:\n  \\[\n  P(-1) = -1 - (-2017) + (-2016) = -1 + 2017 - 2016 = 0\n  \\]\n- **Check P'(-1)**:\n  \\[\n  P'(-1) = 2017 + (-2017) = 0\n  \\]\n\nBoth conditions check out, so we're in good shape.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The value of \\(B\\) is \\( \\boxed{-2016} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since $x^{2017} + Ax+B$ is divisible by $(x+1)^2,$ it must have $x=-1$ as a root, so \\[(-1)^{2017} + A(-1) + B = 0,\\]or $A=B-1.$ Then $x^{2017} + Ax + B = x^{2017} + (B-1)x + B.$ Dividing this polynomial by $x+1$, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} \\frac{x^{2017} + (B-1)x + B}{x+1} &= \\frac{x^{2017} + 1}{x+1} + (B-1)\\\\ &= (x^{2016} - x^{2015} + x^{2014} + \\dots + x^2 - x + 1) + (B-1), \\end{aligned}\\]which must be divisible by $x+1.$ Therefore, setting $x=-1,$ we get \\[\\left((-1)^{2016} - (-1)^{2015} + (-1)^{2014} + \\dots + (-1)^2 + 1\\right) + (B-1) = 0,\\]or $B + 2016 = 0.$ Thus, $B = \\boxed{-2016}.$"
