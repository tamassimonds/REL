    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nFirst, let's break down what the problem is asking. We have a circle with a radius of 4 inches, and from this circle, we're considering a three-quarter section. The problem wants us to find the length of the arc of the discarded quarter-circle. The quarter-circle is the dotted portion.\n\n- **Initial Thoughts:** This problem involves understanding the relationship between the full circle and its parts, specifically portions of the circumference.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Key Information\nNow let's identify the key pieces of information provided:\n- The radius of the full circle is 4 inches.\n- We are dealing with sections of a circle: one part is a three-quarter circle, and the discarded part is a quarter-circle.\n- We're looking for the arc length of the quarter-circle.\n\n### Step 3: Think About Circle Properties\nWe know some properties of circles:\n- The circumference of a whole circle is given by the formula \\( C = 2\\pi r \\).\n- Here, \\( r = 4 \\), so the full circumference \\( C = 2\\pi \\times 4 = 8\\pi \\) inches.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Arc Length of the Quarter-Circle\nThe arc length of any sector of a circle is a fraction of the full circumference. This fraction is determined by the angle of the sector over \\( 360^\\circ \\).\n\n- **Quarter-Circle's Arc:** A quarter-circle is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the whole circle, so its arc length would be:\n  \\[\n  L_{\\text{quarter}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 8\\pi = 2\\pi \\, \\text{inches}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 5: Review the Calculation\n- **Quick Check:** The calculation matches the expected value of a quarter fraction, where \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the full circumference \\( 8\\pi \\) produces the arc length \\( 2\\pi \\).\n- The reasoning here is sound as we\u2019re directly applying the formula for arc length of sections of a circle.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe length of the arc on the discarded quarter-circle is \\( 2\\pi \\) inches. This matches our understanding of fractions of circle circumference and checks out mathematically when applying the formula.\n\nReflecting on this approach, it seems robust and clear, leveraging both the geometry of the circle and the properties of its arcs. There don't seem to be any overlooked aspects of the problem based on the given details. \n\nIf there were alternative strategies, they might involve more geometric visualization or physical constructions of the problem, but the direct mathematical approach here efficiently provides the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The total circumference of the original circle was $2\\cdot 4 \\cdot \\pi = 8\\pi$.  The quarter-circle has length that is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of this, or $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 8\\pi = \\boxed{2\\pi}$ inches."
