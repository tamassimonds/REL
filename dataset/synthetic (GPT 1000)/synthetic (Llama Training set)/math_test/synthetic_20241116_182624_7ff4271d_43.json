    "working_out": "First thoughts: Okay, I'm being asked to find the surface area of a sphere. I've come across this kind of problem before, so I believe I'll need to use the formula for the surface area of a sphere. Hmm, the problem gives the diameter of the sphere, which is 2 inches. I know there's a connection between diameter and radius, and the formula involves the radius, so that seems like my starting point.\n\nBrainstorming strategies: \n\n1. I can use the formula for the surface area of a sphere directly if I find the radius. The formula for surface area is \\(4\\pi r^2\\).\n2. Alternatively, I could consider using the relationship between circumference and area or incorporating volume, but that sounds unnecessarily complicated for this straightforward problem. Sticking with the direct formula seems best.\n\nStep-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify the formula needed:** The surface area \\(A\\) of a sphere is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = 4\\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(r\\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\n2. **Use the given diameter to find the radius:** The problem gives the diameter of the sphere as 2 inches.\n   - The radius \\(r\\) is half of the diameter: \n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{\\text{diameter}}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\\, \\text{inch}\n     \\]\n   Okay, that makes sense; the math checks out so far.\n\n3. **Plug the radius into the surface area formula:** Now, substituting the radius into the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = 4\\pi (1)^2\n   \\]\n   Calculating further, that simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   A = 4\\pi \\times 1 = 4\\pi\n   \\]\n\n4. **Reflecting on the calculation:** Everything seems right. I used the correct formula, determined the radius correctly, and simplified accurately. The problem asked for the answer in terms of \\(\\pi\\), and I\u2019ve maintained \\(\\pi\\) throughout the calculations.\n\n5. **Quick sanity check on the outcome:** The surface area being \\(4\\pi\\) square inches seems reasonable given that it's a perfectly spherical object with a rather small radius. It makes sense given the small size of the sphere.\n\nFinishing up, I'm confident that the surface area in square inches, expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\), is \\(4\\pi\\). There were no unexpected complications or mistakes encountered\u2014always nice when the direct formula is applicable!",
