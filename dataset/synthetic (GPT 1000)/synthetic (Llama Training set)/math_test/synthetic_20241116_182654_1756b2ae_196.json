    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The goal is to rewrite the quadratic expression \\(x^2 + 4x + 5\\) in the form \\(a(x-h)^2 + k\\) and specifically find the value of \\(h\\).\n\n**First thoughts:** \n\nThis looks like a problem involving completing the square, since the goal is to express the quadratic in vertex form. I've done problems like this before, and completing the square is a common method to rewrite quadratic expressions in this format. Let's see how that applies here.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the expression**\n\nWe're starting with \\(x^2 + 4x + 5\\). The structure resembles a standard quadratic expression \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\), where in this case \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 4\\), and \\(c = 5\\).\n\n**Step 2: Recall the vertex form of a quadratic**\n\nThe goal is to get the expression in the form \\(a(x-h)^2 + k\\). Here, \\(a = 1\\), so essentially we aim to rewrite it in the form \\((x-h)^2 + k\\).\n\n**Step 3: Complete the square**\n\nTo complete the square, focus on the \\(x^2 + 4x\\) part of the expression.\n\n- **Completing the square strategy:** \n\n  1. Take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\), square it, and then add and subtract it inside the expression. The coefficient of \\(x\\) is 4, so half of that is 2.\n  \n  2. Square 2 to get \\(4\\).\n  \n  3. Add and subtract this squared value inside the expression: \n\n     \\[\n     x^2 + 4x = (x^2 + 4x + 4) - 4\n     \\]\n\n   I then realize, adding and subtracting 4 doesn't change the overall value of the expression, but helps in forming a perfect square trinomial.\n\n**Step 4: Form the perfect square trinomial**\n\nNow, \\(x^2 + 4x + 4\\) can be written as \\((x+2)^2\\).\n\n- **Wait a second, check this:** Let's verify that \\((x+2)^2\\) expands correctly:\n  \\[\n  (x+2)^2 = x^2 + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot x + 2^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4\n  \\]\n  That matches our trinomial, so we're good!\n\n**Step 5: Rewrite the entire expression**\n\nRemember to account for the constant \\(-4\\) we added inside, and the original constant \\(5\\).\n\n- So, the expression becomes: \n\n  \\[\n  (x+2)^2 - 4 + 5 = (x+2)^2 + 1\n  \\]\n\n**Step 6: Determine \\(h\\)**\n\nBy comparing the expression \\((x+2)^2 + 1\\) with the desired vertex form \\((x-h)^2 + k\\), we can identify:\n- \\((x+2)\\) implies that \\(x - (-2)\\), so \\(h = -2\\).\n\n**Final Step: Double-check the value of \\(h\\)**\n\nThe comparison and the transformation are consistent. When I plugged the expression back and expanded \\((x+2)^2\\), it matched the original terms. Thus, I have confidence that my calculation is correct.\n\n- **Conclusion: \\(h = -2\\)**\n\nI've gone through each step carefully, double-checked the expanded forms, and verified the approach by completing the square correctly. I feel confident in stating that the value of \\(h\\) is indeed \\(-2\\).",
