    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- This problem involves a rational function, so the first thing I think about is the concept of horizontal asymptotes. \n- Horizontal asymptotes are typically found by considering the behavior of the function as \\(x \\to \\infty\\). For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator polynomials.\n- The function crosses its horizontal asymptote if there is a point \\(x\\) such that the function value equals the horizontal asymptote.\n\nUnderstanding Horizontal Asymptotes:\n- The function is given by \\(f(x) = \\frac{2x - 6}{x^3 - 7x^2 - 2x + 6}\\).\n- The numerator \\(2x - 6\\) is of degree 1 and the denominator \\(x^3 - 7x^2 - 2x + 6\\) is of degree 3.\n- When the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\(y = 0\\).\n- So, for this function, the horizontal asymptote is \\(y = 0\\).\n\nStep-by-step Exploration:\n1. We need to find when the function equals its horizontal asymptote, i.e., \\(f(x) = 0\\).\n2. For \\(f(x) = 0\\), the numerator must be zero because the whole expression is zero when the numerator is zero (and the denominator is not zero).\n\nFinding where the Function Equals the Asymptote:\n- Set the numerator equal to zero: \\(2x - 6 = 0\\).\n- Solve for \\(x\\).\n\nCalculation:\n- \\(2x - 6 = 0\\)\n- Add 6 to both sides: \\(2x = 6\\)\n- Divide by 2: \\(x = 3\\)\n\nCheck:\n- With \\(x = 3\\), we need to ensure that the denominator is not zero to confirm \\(f(3) = 0\\).\n- Substitute \\(x = 3\\) in the denominator: \\(3^3 - 7 \\cdot 3^2 - 2 \\cdot 3 + 6\\).\n- Calculate step-by-step:\n  - \\(3^3 = 27\\)\n  - \\(7 \\cdot 3^2 = 63\\)\n  - \\(2 \\cdot 3 = 6\\)\n  - So, \\(27 - 63 - 6 + 6 = 27 - 63 = -36\\), which is not zero.\n\nConclusion:\n- Since the denominator is not zero and the numerator was zero at \\(x = 3\\), the function \\(f(x)\\) indeed equals its horizontal asymptote, \\(y = 0\\), at \\(x = 3\\).\n- Therefore, the function crosses its horizontal asymptote \\(y = 0\\) at \\(x = 3\\).\n\nVerification:\n- Double-check each calculation step and logic to ensure I haven\u2019t overlooked anything.\n\nFinal Reflection:\n- Everything checks out; the approach seems correct, and I am confident in the solution.\n- The value of \\(x\\) at which the function crosses its horizontal asymptote is \\(x = 3\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The horizontal asymptote is the horizontal line that $f$ approaches as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. Since the degree of the denominator is greater than the degree of the numerator, it follows that the horizontal asymptote occurs at the line $y = 0$. Setting this equal to $f(x)$, $$\\frac{2x-6}{x^3 - 7x^2 - 2x + 6} \\Longrightarrow 2x-6 = 0.$$Thus, $x = \\boxed{3}$."
