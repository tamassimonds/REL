    "working_out": "Sure, let's delve into understanding and solving the problem about the sets of roots of unity.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\nInitially, this problem seems to relate to concepts of complex numbers, specifically roots of unity. The sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are composed of complex numbers that satisfy certain unity roots equations, and set \\(C\\) is formed by multiplying elements from these sets. This reminds me of something similar to problems involving least common multiples when dealing with orders of unity roots... Let's explore this.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategy\n\nPaths to consider:\n1. Analyzing the cardinality (number of elements) of sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n2. Understanding how multiplication within complex numbers works.\n3. Trying to infer properties of set \\(C\\) from known properties of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n4. Identifying potential overlaps or cycles, since cyclic groups under multiplication are likely involved.\n\n### Exploring the Problem\n\n#### Step 1: Understanding the Sets\n\n- **Set \\(A = \\{z : z^{18} = 1\\} \\):**  \n  This means we are looking at the 18th roots of unity. The equation \\(z^{18} = 1\\) gives rise to 18 distinct solutions on the complex unit circle. These solutions are given by:\n  \\[\n  z_k = e^{2\\pi i k /18} \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, \\ldots, 17.\n  \\]\n\n- **Set \\(B = \\{w : w^{48} = 1\\} \\):**  \n  Similarly, this set consists of the 48th roots of unity, represented as:\n  \\[\n  w_m = e^{2\\pi i m /48} \\quad \\text{for } m = 0, 1, \\ldots, 47.\n  \\]\n\n#### Step 2: Formulating the Set \\(C\\)\n\n- **Set \\(C = \\{zw : z \\in A, w \\in B\\} \\):**  \n  Each element of \\(C\\) is the product of one element from \\(A\\) and one from \\(B\\). Let's denote an element in \\(C\\) as:\n  \\[\n  c_{k, m} = z_k \\cdot w_m = e^{2\\pi i k / 18} \\cdot e^{2\\pi i m / 48}.\n  \\]\n\n#### Step 3: Simplifying \\(c_{k, m}\\)\n\nNow, \\(c_{k, m}\\) becomes:\n\\[\nc_{k, m} = e^{2\\pi i \\left(\\frac{k}{18} + \\frac{m}{48}\\right)}.\n\\]\n\nFinding the distinct values this expression can take will give us the number of distinct elements in \\(C\\).\n\n#### Step 4: Common Denominator\n\nCombining fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{k}{18} + \\frac{m}{48} = \\frac{8k + 3m}{144}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 5: Distinct Values and Simplifying\n\nTo find the number of distinct values:\n\n1. **The order is given by the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 48.**\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM}(18, 48) = 144.\n   \\]\n\n2. This expression \\(c_{k, m} = e^{2\\pi i (8k + 3m)/144}\\) should give all different multiples of \\(\\frac{2\\pi i}{144}\\), corresponding to the different distinct values we looked for.\n\n3. We aim to find integers \\(n = 8k + 3m\\) that produce distinct results in modulo 144. This needs further exploration, focusing on the behavior of this function \\(n\\).\n\n#### Step 6: Determine Distinct Multiples\n\n**Final Consideration:**\nBy B\u00e9zout's lemma, since 8 and 3 are coefficients relating to two relatively prime numbers, their combination (in modulo terms) will cover all residues modulo 144 (in this case). Thus, all residues from 0 to 143 can be represented, providing \\(144\\) distinct values.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe set \\(C\\) contains \\(144\\) distinct elements, which confirms our conclusion that set \\(C\\) forms a complete group of order 144 on the unit circle of complex numbers. This logical deduction verifies that distinctness comes from \\((144\\)-roots of unity), which means \\( \\boxed{144} \\) distinct elements in \\(C\\). This matches the intuition tied to LCM-related problems in group cycles.",

It follows that $C$ contains $\\boxed{144}$ elements."
