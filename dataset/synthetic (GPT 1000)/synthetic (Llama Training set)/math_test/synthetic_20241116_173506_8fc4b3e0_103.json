    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. It's asking us to find the fifth term in an arithmetic sequence given the first and ninth terms. \n\n_**Initial Thoughts:**_\n\nThis looks familiar, like something I've seen before with sequences. I know the basic property of an arithmetic sequence is that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Maybe I can use this information to solve for the fifth term.\n\n_**Brainstorming Strategies:**_\n\n1. **Understand the Sequence:** \n   - The first term (\\(a_1\\)) is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n   - The ninth term (\\(a_9\\)) is \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\).\n   - There's a common difference (\\(d\\)) between each term.\n\n2. I'm thinking I can use the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\n   \\]\n\n3. Using this formula for \\(a_9\\):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = a_1 + 8 \\cdot d = \\frac{4}{5}\n   \\]\n\n4. I could solve this equation to find \\(d\\), the common difference. Let's start there.\n\n_**Attempting the Calculation:**_\n\n1. Set up the equation for the ninth term:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} + 8d = \\frac{4}{5}\n   \\]\n\n2. Solving for \\(d\\):\n   - First, isolate \\(d\\):\n     \\[\n     8d = \\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{2}{3}\n     \\]\n\n3. I need a common denominator to subtract the fractions. The least common denominator of 3 and 5 is 15. Let's rewrite both fractions:\n   - \\(\\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{12}{15}\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{10}{15}\\)\n\n4. Now subtract:\n   \\[\n   8d = \\frac{12}{15} - \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{2}{15}\n   \\]\n\n5. Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \\(d\\):\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{2}{15} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{60}\n   \\]\n\n6. Quick check: If \\(d = \\frac{1}{60}\\), does that make sense? Seems plausible, let's continue.\n\n_**Finding the Fifth Term:**_\n\n1. Use the \\(n\\)-th term formula to find the fifth term (\\(a_5\\)):\n   \\[\n   a_5 = a_1 + 4 \\cdot d\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute the values found:\n   \\[\n   a_5 = \\frac{2}{3} + 4 \\times \\frac{1}{60}\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplify:\n   - \\(4 \\times \\frac{1}{60} = \\frac{4}{60} = \\frac{1}{15}\\)\n\n4. Add \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{15}\\):\n   - Rewriting \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) as \\(\\frac{10}{15}\\) to add:\n     \\[\n     a_5 = \\frac{10}{15} + \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{11}{15}\n     \\]\n\n_**Final Thoughts:**_\n\nLooks like \\(\\frac{11}{15}\\) is the fifth term of this sequence. Everything checks out with how arithmetic sequences work, and I verified each fraction operation carefully. I think this is correct. \n\nThere might be simpler ways to solve it, but this approach feels solid for me!",
