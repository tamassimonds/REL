    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: \\(\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{27}\\right\\rceil - \\left\\lfloor\\sqrt{26}\\right\\rfloor\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nFirst, let me parse the expression. The expression asks us to take the ceiling of \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) and the floor of \\(\\sqrt{26}\\), and then subtract the second from the first. \n\nHmm, ceilings and floors... These functions involve rounding numbers. The ceiling of a number is the smallest integer greater than or equal to that number, while the floor is the largest integer less than or equal to it.\n\n### Step 2: Compute \\(\\sqrt{27}\\)\n\nLet's approximate \\(\\sqrt{27}\\). I know that \\(5^2 = 25\\) and \\(6^2 = 36\\). So, \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) must be between 5 and 6.\n\nIs it closer to 5 or 6?  \nWell, \\(27\\) is closer to \\(25\\) than to \\(36\\), suggesting \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) is closer to 5. But let's narrow it down more precisely.\n\nFor a better approximation: The number midway between 5 and 6 is 5.5. \\(5.5^2 = 30.25\\), which is greater than 27. So \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) must be less than 5.5.\n\nBetween 5 and 5.5, let me try 5.2:  \n\\[ \n5.2^2 = 27.04\n\\] \nYes, \\(27.04\\) is very close to 27. Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{27} \\approx 5.2\\).\n\n### Step 3: Compute \\(\\left\\lceil \\sqrt{27} \\right\\rceil\\)\n\nSince \\(\\sqrt{27} \\approx 5.2\\), the ceiling of \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) is 6. That makes sense because 5.2 is greater than 5.\n\n### Step 4: Compute \\(\\sqrt{26}\\)\n\nNow for \\(\\sqrt{26}\\). We know:\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\sqrt{26}\\) lies between 5 and 6.\n\nMaybe try a midpoint: 5.1.  \n\\[ \n5.1^2 = 26.01 \n\\] \nOk, 5.1 is slightly too large because \\(26.01\\) is just over 26.\n\nGoing a tad lower, let's try 5.05:  \n\\[ \n5.05^2 = 25.5025 \n\\] \nThat's too low. So, \\(\\sqrt{26}\\) should be just above 5.05, probably around 5.1.\n\n### Step 5: Compute \\(\\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{26} \\right\\rfloor\\)\n\nSince it's likely a bit above 5, the floor of \\(\\sqrt{26}\\) is 5.\n\n### Step 6: Evaluate the Expression\n\nFinally, let's evaluate the initial expression by plugging in these values:\n\\[\n\\left\\lceil \\sqrt{27} \\right\\rceil - \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{26} \\right\\rfloor = 6 - 5 = 1\n\\]\n\n### Final Check:\n\nLet me review the logic quickly:  \nFor \\(\\sqrt{27}\\), approximate as 5.2, ceiling is 6.  \nFor \\(\\sqrt{26}\\), approximate around 5.1, floor is 5.\n\nYep, everything checks out. The final answer is \\(\\boxed{1}\\). That was a nice exploration through approximation and understanding of how ceilings and floors work!",
