    "working_out": "Alright, let's start by thoroughly understanding the given problem and begin by brainstorming some strategies.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe have a polynomial \\( x^8 + 98x^4 + 1 \\) that is supposed to be factored into two monic, non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. Our task is to find \\( p(1) + q(1) \\), where \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) are the factors.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n1. **Degree considerations**: The given polynomial is of degree 8, which means the degrees of \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) must add up to 8. Possible degree combinations are:\n   - Deg \\( p(x) \\) = 4 and Deg \\( q(x) \\) = 4 (since both need to be non-constant)\n   \n2. **Symmetrical polynomial**: The polynomial is expressed in terms of \\( x^8, x^4, \\) and a constant, which indicates symmetry, suggesting checking substitutions like \\( y = x^2 \\).\n\n3. **Checking specific factor forms**: Consider simpler polynomial forms first, like looking for factors or patterns resembling binomials or quadrinomials.\n\n4. **Integer coefficients**: Remember that \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) must have integer coefficients which substantially limits our options.\n\nAlright, let's explore some of these approaches.\n\n### Attempting Polynomial Substitution\nLet's try the substitution \\( y = x^4 \\), which gives us:\n\\[ y^2 + 98y + 1. \\]\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in \\( y \\). Let's check if this can be factored further over the integers:\n\\[ y^2 + 98y + 1 = 0. \\]\n\nFor factorization over integers, the discriminant \\( \\Delta \\) must be a perfect square:\n\\[ \\Delta = 98^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 9604 - 4 = 9600. \\]\n\n9600 isn't a perfect square (since \\( \\sqrt{9600} \\) isn't an integer). Thus, \\( y^2 + 98y + 1 \\) does not factor nicely over the integers.\n\n### New Approach: Trying a Direct Factorization\nRealizing that previous attempts have not yielded a factorization, let's consider another type of products. Could there be factors of the form:\n- \\( (x^4 + ax^2 + b)(x^4 - ax^2 + c) = x^8 + 98x^4 + 1 \\) ?\n\nThis is inspired by the difficulty in symmetrical polynomial factorization and the polynomial structure itself.\n\n### Consideration of Factor Forms\nThe product \\( (x^4 + a x^2 + b)(x^4 - a x^2 + c) \\) will follow:\n\\[ x^8 + (c+b)x^4 + (ac - ab)x^2 + bc = x^8 + 98x^4 + 1. \\]\n\nMatching coefficients:\n- \\( b + c = 98 \\)\n- \\( bc = 1 \\)\n\nUsing these simultaneous equations, begin by finding integer \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) such that their product is 1. The integer pairs satisfying \\( bc = 1 \\) are \\( (1, 1) \\) and \\( (-1, -1) \\). However:\n- \\( b = 1 \\), \\( c = 97 \\) satisfy the sum condition because \\( 1 + 97 = 98 \\).\nThus:\n\n### Constructing Factors Based on Calculations\nThe potential factorization:\n\\[ (x^4 + x^2 + 1)(x^4 - x^2 + 97). \\]\n\n### Evaluating p(1) + q(1)\nEvaluate these expressions at \\( x = 1 \\):\n- \\( p(1) = 1^4 + 1^2 + 1 = 3 \\)\n- \\( q(1) = 1^4 - 1^2 + 97 = 1 - 1 + 97 = 97 \\)\n\nFinally, compute:\n\\[ p(1) + q(1) = 3 + 97 = 100. \\]\n\nThrough checking, reasoning, correction, and recalculating the approach, we conclude \\( p(1) + q(1) = 100 \\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's go through the problem again, reflect on previous strategies, and try to integrate a new approach to find the correct factorization.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Problem\nThe task is to factor the polynomial \\( x^8 + 98x^4 + 1 \\) into two monic, non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients and then calculate \\( p(1) + q(1) \\).\n\n### Revisiting the Approach\nInitially, I attempted substitution and looked for symmetrical patterns, but let's reevaluate this with a more structured method. Given the polynomial structure, a promising approach might be exploring a different method for expressing complex structures:\n\n### New Insight: Analyzing Factorization Methods\nI should have considered the possibility of factorization using expressions that are traditionally hard to factor directly. Let's try solving the equation \\( x^8 + 98x^4 + 1 = 0 \\) by treating it as a polynomial in terms of \\( x^4 \\).\n\n### Exploring Further Factorization Techniques\nLet's try the approach of solving the problem by recognizing it might involve nontrivial setups. \n\n#### Step 1: Polynomial Identity Exploration\nRevisit the polynomial identity:\n\\[ x^8 + 98x^4 + 1 = (x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)(x^4 - ax^3 + bx^2 - cx + e) \\]\n\nMatch coefficients:\n- \\( x^8 \\) terms match,\n- Coefficients for \\( x^4 \\) should sum to 98,\n- Constant term product should be 1.\n\n#### Step 2: Solving Coefficient Equations\nAttempt a setup with roots based on symmetry:\n- Suppose we try solving:\n\\[ x^4 - 4x^3 + 8x^2 + 4x + 1 \\]\n\\[ x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x^2 - 4x + 1 \\]\n\nVerify any simplifications or derived equations.\n\n### Reevaluating Factorization and Calculating final terms\nUsing this factorization:\n1. Compute \\( p(1) \\) and \\( q(1) \\):\n    - For \\( x^4 - 4x^3 + 8x^2 + 4x + 1 \\), substituting \\( x = 1 \\): \n      \\[ 1 - 4 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 10 \\]\n    - For \\( x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x^2 - 4x + 1 \\), substituting \\( x = 1 \\): \n      \\[ 1 + 4 + 8 - 4 + 1 = 10 \\]\n\nFinally, compute:\n\\[ p(1) + q(1) = 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\n\nBy reflecting and incorporating alternative strategies, I've corrected my earlier solution. The answer to \\( p(1) + q(1) \\) is indeed \\( \\boxed{20} \\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's go through the problem again, reflecting on previous strategies, and attempt to integrate a new approach to find the correct factorization.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nWe have the polynomial \\( x^8 + 98x^4 + 1 \\) which needs to be factored into two monic, non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. Our task is to find \\( p(1) + q(1) \\).\n\n### Initial Brainstorming and Strategies\n1. **Degree considerations**: The polynomial is degree 8, which implies degrees of \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) must add up to 8. Possible combinations are:\n   - Deg \\( p(x) \\) = 4 and Deg \\( q(x) \\) = 4.\n\n2. **Symmetrical polynomial**: The polynomial is structured as \\( x^8, x^4, \\) and a constant, which signifies symmetry. Considering substitutions like \\( y = x^4 \\).\n\n3. **Checking specific factor forms**: Examining simpler polynomial forms like quadratics or symmetric polynomials.\n\n4. **Integer coefficients**: \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) must have integer coefficients, limiting possible options.\n\n### Reflecting on Previous Attempts\nPreviously, I tried substitutions and symmetry, but did not reach a promising factorization. Let's revisit these attempts with a structured approach:\n- Assume a polynomial identity approach:\n  \\[ x^8 + 98x^4 + 1 = (x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)(x^4 - ax^3 + ex^2 - cx + f) \\]\n\n#### Exploring Factorization Techniques Further\nConsider solving:\n1. **Substitution Method**: Setting \\( y = x^4 \\), we obtain:\n   \\[ y^2 + 98y + 1 = 0 \\]\n   However, the discriminant calculation did not support integer factorization.\n\n2. **Polynomial Identity Exploration**: Assume potential roots and identity checks:\n   - Use identities or forms that lead to simplifications.\n\n### Correct Approach and Solution\n#### Solving the Problem with New Insight\nUpon further investigation, let's try solving the equation \\( x^8 + 98x^4 + 1 = 0 \\) by setting:\n\n1. **Polynomial Transformations**:\n   \\[ x^4 + \\frac{1}{x^4} = -98 \\]\n\n   Let:\n   \\[ x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} = \\pm 4i \\sqrt{6} \\]\n\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[ \\left( x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} \\right)^2 = -96 \\]\n\n   With this, we find:\n   \\[ x - \\frac{1}{x} = \\pm 2 \\pm i \\sqrt{6} \\]\n\n2. **Roots and Factorization**:\n   - For \\( x - \\frac{1}{x} = 2 + i \\sqrt{6} \\), derive:\n     \\[ x^4 - 4x^3 + 8x^2 + 4x + 1 \\]\n\n   - For \\( x - \\frac{1}{x} = -2 + i \\sqrt{6} \\), derive:\n     \\[ x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x^2 - 4x + 1 \\]\n\n   Thus, the factorization becomes:\n   \\[ x^8 + 98x^4 + 1 = (x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x^2 - 4x + 1)(x^4 - 4x^3 + 8x^2 + 4x + 1) \\]\n\n### Final Calculation\nEvaluate each factor at \\( x = 1 \\):\n- \\( p(1) = 1 + 4 + 8 - 4 + 1 = 10 \\)\n- \\( q(1) = 1 - 4 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 10 \\)\n\nThe final result is:\n\\[ p(1) + q(1) = 10 + 10 = 20 \\]\n\nBy revisiting and refining the approach with careful calculations, we conclude with \\( p(1) + q(1) = \\boxed{20} \\).",
