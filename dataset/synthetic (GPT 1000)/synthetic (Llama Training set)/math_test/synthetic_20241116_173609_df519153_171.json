    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I want to really unpack it step by step, brainstorming along the way and considering different approaches. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\nMy club has 15 members and I need to choose a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer. The key thing here is that no member can hold more than one office. This indicates that the order of selection matters because each role is distinct.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n1. **Permutation and Combination Concepts**: My initial thought is that this problem relates to permutations since we're selecting positions with specific roles (not just a group without roles, which would be a combination).\n2. **Enumerative Thinking**: Maybe I could think about how to list all possibilities manually, but that seems impractical with 15 members.\n3. **Sequential Method**: Assign each position one at a time from the pool of members, reducing the pool as roles are filled.\n\nHmm, the sequential method feels right since it inherently respects the constraints of unique roles. Let's pursue this.\n\n### Exploring Sequential Method\n- **Step 1: Choose President**\n  - There are 15 members, so 15 choices for president.\n\n- **Step 2: Choose Vice-President**\n  - After choosing the president, 14 members remain, so 14 choices for vice-president.\n\n- **Step 3: Choose Secretary**\n  - With president and vice-president chosen, there are 13 members left, so 13 choices for secretary.\n\n- **Step 4: Choose Treasurer**\n  - Finally, with the previous three roles filled, 12 members remain, so 12 choices for treasurer.\n\n### Calculating the Total\nTo find the total number of ways to assign these roles, I multiply the choices at each step:\n\\[ \n15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \n\\]\n\nLet me just calculate this quickly to make sure it feels right...\n- \\(15 \\times 14 = 210\\)\n- \\(210 \\times 13 = 2730\\)\n- \\(2730 \\times 12 = 32760\\)\n\n### Reflecting on Correctness\n- **Checking Logic**: The sequential method seems consistent with the problem constraints (no member in more than one role) and uses permutations as expected since order matters.\n- **Rethinking Strategies**: I initially considered combinations, but roles have distinct identities which means order matters\u2014validating my sequential permutation choice.\n\n- **Quick Sanity Check**: The numbers seem reasonable given the pool size decreases with each assigned role, reflecting how the problem constraints tighten as we fill positions.\n\nYes, I feel satisfied with this. The permutations approach aligned naturally with how we tackled the problem in discrete steps, and the arithmetic checked out. I believe the answer is robust: **32,760 ways** to choose these roles. Now I\u2019m confident in presenting this as the solution!",
