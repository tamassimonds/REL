    "working_out": "Alright, let's start tackling this problem step by step. I'm looking at Jim and Martha on opposite strategies to get across a rectangular field. We're trying to determine how much less Jim walks compared to Martha.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n- Jim walks diagonally across the field.\n- Martha walks along the perimeter, which consists of its length and width.\n- The field is 300 feet wide and 400 feet long.\n\nFirst thoughts: Drawing a mental picture of the problem, I imagine a rectangle with Jim cutting straight across and Martha going along two sides. This setup seems familiar, like a classic application of the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n**Strategy Brainstorming:**\nWhat's jumping out to me here is that Jim's path forms a right triangle with the length and width as the two legs. This suggests using the Pythagorean theorem to find the diagonal distance. Meanwhile, Martha's walking path is straightforward arithmetic: sum of two sides.\n\nLet's work this out...\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Jim's Diagonal Path Using Pythagorean Theorem**\n- The formula for the diagonal (hypotenuse) of a right triangle is \\( c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n- Here, \\( a = 300 \\) (width) and \\( b = 400 \\) (length).\n\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} \\]\n\n**Calculating:**\n- First calculate \\( 300^2 = 90000 \\).\n- Then \\( 400^2 = 160000 \\).\n- Add them: \\( 90000 + 160000 = 250000 \\).\n- Now take the square root: \\( \\sqrt{250000} = 500 \\).\n\nAh, Jim walks 500 feet diagonally. Makes sense so far!\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Martha's Path**\n- Martha walks along two sides: first the length, then the width.\n- So she walks: \\( 300 + 400 = 700 \\) feet.\n\nOkay, sounds straightforward. A quick check on this: she walks the length and then the width; no funny business here, seems right.\n\n**Step 3: Compare Jim's and Martha's Paths**\n- Jim walks 500 feet.\n- Martha walks 700 feet.\n\nWe are tasked with finding how many feet less Jim walks compared to Martha:\n\n\\[ 700 - 500 = 200 \\]\n\nJim walks 200 feet less than Martha.\n\n**Reflecting on the Solution:**\n- The use of the Pythagorean theorem was suitable here to calculate Jim's path.\n- Simple arithmetic was appropriate for Martha's path.\n- Results make intuitive sense given the geometry involved.\n\nWait, let me double-check: the rectangular dimensions and straightforward paths check out, calculations line up, and the logic follows correctly.\n\nI\u2019m confident with this approach and conclusion. Jim indeed walks 200 feet less than Martha does by walking directly across the diagonal.",

  "ground_truth": "The diagonal of the field is $\\sqrt{300^2+400^2}=500$ feet long so Jim walks 500 feet. Two adjacent sides of the field are $300+400=700$ feet long so Martha walks 700 feet. Jim walks $700-500=\\boxed{200}$ feet less than Martha."
