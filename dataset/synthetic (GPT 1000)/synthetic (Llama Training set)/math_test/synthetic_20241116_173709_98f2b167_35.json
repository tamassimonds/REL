    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem together step by step, treating it as a puzzle that we're going to piece together. Our goal is to find the largest \\( n \\) such that the number \\( a = 2^{306} \\cdot 3^{340} \\) is a perfect \\( n \\)th power.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, the key phrase \"perfect \\( n \\)th power\" stands out. A number is a perfect \\( n \\)th power if it can be expressed as \\( b^n \\) for some integer \\( b \\). This usually means that the exponents in its prime factorization must be multiples of \\( n \\).\n\nHmm... this reminds me of a number theory problem I've seen before involving exponents and divisibility. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n1. The number \\( a \\) is composed of powers of 2 and 3. To be a perfect nth power, each of these exponents in the prime factorization must be divisible by \\( n \\).\n2. So, for \\( 2^{306} \\cdot 3^{340} = (b)^n \\), both exponents \\( 306 \\) and \\( 340 \\) should be divisible by \\( n \\).\n3. To maximize \\( n \\), it should be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of those exponents since it would be the largest number that divides both exponents completely.\n\n**Checking This Approach:**\n\nLet's calculate the GCD of 306 and 340.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation of GCD:**\n\n1. **Prime Factorize 306:**\n   - 306 is even, divide by 2: \\( 306 \\div 2 = 153 \\)\n   - 153: sum of digits is \\( 1 + 5 + 3 = 9 \\), divisible by 3: \\( 153 \\div 3 = 51 \\)\n   - 51: sum of digits is \\( 5 + 1 = 6 \\), divisible by 3: \\( 51 \\div 3 = 17 \\)\n   - 17 is a prime number.\n   - So, \\( 306 = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 17 \\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorize 340:**\n   - 340 is even, divide by 2: \\( 340 \\div 2 = 170 \\)\n   - 170 is even, divide by 2 again: \\( 170 \\div 2 = 85 \\)\n   - 85: sum of digits is \\( 8 + 5 = 13 \\), not divisible by 3. Ends in 5, so 85: divide by 5: \\( 85 \\div 5 = 17 \\)\n   - 17 is a prime number.\n   - So, \\( 340 = 2^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 17 \\).\n\n3. **Finding GCD:**\n   - The common primes are 2 and 17.\n   - \\(306 \\) has \\(2^1, 3^2, 17^1\\)\n   - \\(340 \\) has \\(2^2, 5^1, 17^1\\)\n\n   The common factors are \\(2\\) and \\(17\\), each raised to the minimum power present in both numbers.\n   The least power of 2 is \\(2^1\\) and for 17 is \\(17^1\\), hence \\(GCD = 2^1 \\times 17 = 34\\).\n\n**Reflect and Verify:**\n\nOkay, that seems right. Each type of factor must be considered with the smallest power in both factorizations. It's interesting to see how splitting down the numbers to their basic elements simplifies things.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe largest \\( n \\) such that \\( 2^{306} \\cdot 3^{340} \\) is a perfect \\( n \\)th power is \\( n = 34 \\). This means the number can successfully be expressed in the form of \\( b^{34} \\) for some integer \\( b \\).\n\nIf anything went awry, it would have been during the GCD calculation or factorization, but I feel confident based on our step-by-step breakdown.",

  "ground_truth": "We claim that $a$ is a perfect $n$th power if and only if $n$ divides both $306$ and $340$. To see this, suppose that $n \\mid 306$ and $n \\mid 340$. Then $2^{\\frac{306}{n}} 3^{\\frac{340}{n}}$ is an integer whose $n$th power is $a$. Conversely, suppose $b^n = a$. Then the only primes which divide $b$ are $2$ and $3$. Choose $c$ and $d$ so that $b=2^{c} 3^{d}$. Then $b^n = 2^{cn} 3^{dn} = 2^{306} 3^{340}$, which implies $n \\mid 306$ and $n \\mid 340$. This concludes our proof of the claim that $a$ is an $n$th power if and only if $n$ divides both $306$ and $340$.\n\nThe largest number which simultaneously divides two numbers is their GCD. Using the Euclidean algorithm, the GCD of $306$ and $340$ is the same as the GCD of $340$ and $340-306 = 34$. Since $34$ divides $340$, the GCD of these two is $34$, so the largest possible $n$ is $\\boxed{34}$."
