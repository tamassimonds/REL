    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'm going to start off brainstorming some initial thoughts and strategies for approaching this sum. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nWhen I first look at this sum, I see that we have a double-indexed series. We're summing over all positive integers \\( i \\) and \\( j \\) with the condition \\( 1 \\leq j < i \\). The terms in the series are \\(\\frac{1}{2^{i+j}}\\), which remind me of geometric series due to the powers of 2.\n\nI recognize these types of problems often involve manipulating bounds or changing the order of summation to simplify. My instinct tells me that changing the order of summation might reveal some patterns or simplifications. However, I need to ensure that doing so adheres to the constraints given.\n\n### Strategy Brainstorm\n\n1. **Direct Calculation**: Try direct summation for small values of \\( i \\) to better understand the pattern.\n2. **Change of Variables**: Maybe try a transformation like letting \\( k = i + j \\) so that the expression becomes easier to manage.\n3. **Series Manipulation**: Express the series in terms of simpler geometric series.\n\n### Attempt - Direct Calculation\n\nLet's sum for small values of \\( i \\) to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n- For \\( i = 2 \\): the only valid \\( j \\) is \\( 1 \\). So, the term is \\(\\frac{1}{2^{2+1}} = \\frac{1}{8}\\).\n- For \\( i = 3 \\): valid \\( j \\) values are \\( 1 \\) and \\( 2 \\). The terms are \\(\\frac{1}{2^{4}}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2^{5}}\\).\n  \n    Checking calculations: \\(\\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{2}{32} + \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{3}{32}\\).\n\nContinuing this pattern up to \\( i = 4 \\), calculate each step to see if a pattern becomes evident.\n\n- For \\( i = 4 \\): valid \\( j \\) values are \\( 1, 2, 3 \\). Terms: \\(\\frac{1}{2^{5}}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2^{6}}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2^{7}}\\).\n\nCalculating this: \\(\\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128}\\).\n\n\\[\\frac{1 \\cdot 4}{128} + \\frac{2}{128} + \\frac{1}{128} = \\frac{7}{128}\\].\n\n### Analysis\n\nAfter computing for small values of \\( i \\), I notice that the powers of 2 result from combinations of \\( i \\) and \\( j \\). The pattern looks like each term for fixed \\( i \\) sums a geometric series for different initial values and rates.\n\n### Change of Variables\n\nAttempt to change the variables:\n\nConsider a substitution where \\( k = i + j \\). This substitution allows us to express the sum \\( \\sum_{1 \\leq j < i}\\) entirely in terms of \\( k \\).\n\nRewrite the series in terms of \\( k \\):\n- For a fixed \\( i \\), \\( j \\) ranges from \\( 1 \\) to \\( i-1 \\) which means \\( k \\) ranges from \\( i+1 \\) to \\( 2i-1 \\).\n\nThen, change the order of summation and compute:\n- \\( \\sum_{i=2}^{\\infty} \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \\frac{1}{2^{i+j}} = \\sum_{k=3}^{\\infty}\\sum_{\\mathrm{appropriate}\\, i}\\frac{1}{2^k}\\).\n\n### Series Manipulation\n\nNotice that the resulting terms for each \\( k \\) aggregate over all feasible \\( i \\). This converts into:\n\n- \\( \\frac{1}{2^3}(1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\ldots)\\).\n\nIt seems like a geometric series where each subsequent 'diagonal' would form corresponding decreasing geometric progressions.\n\nAfter simplification, observe that:\n\n1. Further simplifications result in half of an infinite geometric series with ratio \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n2. Total series becomes \\(\\frac{1}{2^2} \\times \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUpon double-checking through a different perspective such as by using geometric series formulas, I realize I indeed transformed and aggregated terms correctly. The sum of the series converges to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{1 \\le j < i} \\frac{1}{2^{i + j}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis result matches my earlier checks and appropriately reflects simplifications over geometric sequences.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculations, so let's revisit the problem with a fresh perspective. \n\n### Reflection and Revised Strategy\n\nUpon reviewing the problem again, I realized that my initial approach to simplify the summation was misguided. Let's go over the problem again by systematically evaluating and re-evaluating our steps, trying a different way to change the summation order.\n\n### Step-by-Step Exploration\n\nThe original sum involved calculating: \n\\[\n\\sum_{1 \\le j < i} \\frac{1}{2^{i + j}}.\n\\]\nThis sum is over positive integers \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) such that \\(1 \\le j < i\\).\n\n### Change of Order\n\nInstead of focusing on \\(i\\), let's try changing the order of summation, focusing on \\(j\\) first. This change might reveal an easier structure to manage:\n\n1. **Fix \\(j\\)**: For a fixed \\(j\\), \\(i\\) ranges from \\(j+1\\) to infinity. Thus the inner sum becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i = j+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^{i+j}} = \\frac{1}{2^j} \\sum_{i = j+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^i}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify Inner Sum**: The inner sum \\(\\sum_{i = j+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^i}\\) is a geometric series where the first term is \\(\\frac{1}{2^{j+1}}\\) with a common ratio \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i = j+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^i} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2^{j+1}}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2^j}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Outer Sum**:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{j = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^j} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^j} = \\sum_{j = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{4^j}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum Up the Series**: The series \\(\\sum_{j = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{4^j}\\) is another geometric series with first term \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) and common ratio \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{j = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{4^j} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n   \\]\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nUpon double-checking my revised solution, I see that the sum converges to \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\\). This matches the correct approach, and I feel confident about the accurate reinterpretation and simplification of the series.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculations. Let's revisit the problem with a fresh perspective and systematically evaluate our steps. First, I'll brainstorm a few strategic approaches to solve the series more effectively.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Re-Analyze the Problem**: Reconsider the structure of the sum and the constraints \\(1 \\leq j < i\\).\n2. **Change of Summation Order**: Try changing the order of summation to see if it simplifies the expression.\n3. **Explore Geometric Series**: Given the powers of 2, consider if the series can be converted into recognizable geometric series.\n\n### Re-evaluation with New Strategy\n\nLet's dig deeper and re-evaluate our series using a change of summation order:\n\nThe original series is given by:\n\\[\n\\sum_{1 \\le j < i} \\frac{1}{2^{i + j}}.\n\\]\nTo tackle this, let's change the order of summation and focus on summing over \\(j\\) first, then \\(i\\).\n\n#### Change of Summation Order\n\n1. **Fix \\(j\\)**: For a fixed \\(j\\), \\(i\\) ranges from \\(j+1\\) to infinity. This gives:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i = j+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^{i+j}} = \\frac{1}{2^j} \\sum_{i = j+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^i}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the Inner Sum**: The inner sum \\(\\sum_{i = j+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^i}\\) is a geometric series with first term \\(\\frac{1}{2^{j+1}}\\) and common ratio \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), which simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i = j+1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^i} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2^{j+1}}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2^j}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Outer Sum**: Substitute back into the outer sum:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{j = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^j} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^j} = \\sum_{j = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{4^j}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the Series**: The series \\(\\sum_{j = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{4^j}\\) is another geometric series with first term \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) and common ratio \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{j = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{4^j} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter revisiting the problem using this more structured approach, I have confirmed that the correct sum of the series converges to \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\\). This systematic method aligns perfectly with our expectations for simplifying series through strategic reordering of terms and recognizing geometric series patterns.",
