    "working_out": "Let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step and explore how we can solve it, keeping track of my thought process along the way. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\nAt first glance, this equation, \\(441 + 2(21)(19) + 361 = x\\), looks like it involves basic arithmetic operations with integers. The presence of numbers like 441 and 361 makes me think about squares because these are numbers I recognize as perfect squares: \\(21^2\\) and \\(19^2\\) respectively. That intuition might be important for simplifying or solving the expression.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\nI\u2019m thinking that the equation might have some sort of simplification involving squares. Could this be some form of an expanded binomial? An expression like \\((a+b)^2\\) that expands to \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\)?\n\n- Let's see if that might fit here. \n- \\(441\\) is \\(21^2\\).\n- \\(361\\) is \\(19^2\\).\n- The middle term, \\(2(21)(19)\\), fits the pattern \\(2ab\\) because it can be thought of as \\(2 \\times 21 \\times 19\\).\n\nOh! This does remind me of the binomial expansion \\((a+b)^2\\), where \\(a = 21\\) and \\(b = 19\\). The equation is essentially saying:\n\\[ \n21^2 + 2(21)(19) + 19^2 = (21 + 19)^2\n\\]\n\n### Calculation\nUsing the above realization:\n- \\((21 + 19)^2 = 40^2\\).\n- Now let's calculate \\(40^2\\).\n\n### Calculating\nWe know:\n- \\(40^2 = 1600\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter verifying the expansions and calculations, it seems correct that the given equation simplifies to:\n\\[ x = 1600 \\]\n\n### Double-checking\nLet\u2019s quickly verify:\n- From the original form:\n  - \\(441\\) is indeed \\(21^2\\).\n  - Similarly, \\(361\\) is \\(19^2\\).\n  - The middle term \\(2(21)(19)\\) fits perfectly into the binomial expansion.\n\nBy restructuring the given expression into the squared form as \\((21 + 19)^2\\), and confirming through calculations, everything checks out. The equation holds true. \n\nThus, the solution for \\(x\\) is:\n\\[ x = 1600 \\]\n\nThis approach clarifies the equation using the properties of perfect squares and basic algebraic manipulation, reaffirming that \\(x = 1600\\) is indeed correct.",
