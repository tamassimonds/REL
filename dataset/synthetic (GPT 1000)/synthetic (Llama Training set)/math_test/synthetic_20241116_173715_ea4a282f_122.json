    "working_out": "Alright, let's take this problem step-by-step and think aloud as we work through it.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nFirst, let's simplify the expression we're dealing with:\n\n\\[\n(972 - 268)(973 - 267)(974 - 266) + (968 - 272)(967 - 273)(966 - 274) - (999 - 222)^3\n\\]\n\nAt a glance, we're looking at three distinct components in this arithmetic expression. The units digit can usually be approached by simplifying each part to its units value first. The units digit is determined by the rightmost digit of a number.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify Each Component**\n\nLet's start simplifying the parts:\n\n1. \\((972 - 268) = 704\\)\n2. \\((973 - 267) = 706\\)\n3. \\((974 - 266) = 708\\)\n\nInstead of multiplying these large numbers directly, focus on their units digits:\n- Units digits: \\(4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8\\)\n\nAnother similar set:\n1. \\((968 - 272) = 696\\), units digit = 6\n2. \\((967 - 273) = 694\\), units digit = 4\n3. \\((966 - 274) = 692\\), units digit = 2\n\n- Units digits: \\(6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2\\)\n\nFinally, for subtracting:\n- \\((999 - 222) = 777\\), units digit = 7\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Units Digits of Simplified Expressions**\n\nFor the first expression, calculate the units digit of \\(4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8\\):  \n- \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\), units digit is \\(4\\)  \n- \\(4 \\times 8 = 32\\), units digit is \\(2\\)\n\nFor the second expression, calculate the units digit of \\(6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2\\):  \n- \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\), units digit is \\(4\\)  \n- \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\), units digit is \\(8\\)\n\nNow for the cube:  \n- \\(7^3: 7 \\times 7 = 49\\), last digit is \\(9\\)  \n- \\(9 \\times 7 = 63\\), last digit is \\(3\\)\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Result**\n\nNow, put everything together:  \n\\[\n2 + 8 - 3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n10 - 3 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Initial Checks and Reflections:**\n\n- I need to double-check if the individual multiplication's units digits are carried correctly, specifically in dealing with negative numbers or subtraction affecting end digits. Everything well here.\n\n- Calculations appear to be consistent with the sequence. Approaching summation and final deduction seems correct given mathematical evaluations of just units.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter calculating the units digit throughout each operation and ensuring clarity of the arithmetic steps, the units digit of the original expression turned out to be \\(7\\).\n\nFeel free to check further if needed, but the \"aha moment\" here is refining initial calculations creatively while simplifying steps down to just units. This seems solid!",

  "ground_truth": "We begin by finding the units digit within each set of parentheses.  We get $$ 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 + 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 - 7^3. $$Now we combine the units digit of each part to get $$2 + 8 - 3 = \\boxed{7}.$$"
