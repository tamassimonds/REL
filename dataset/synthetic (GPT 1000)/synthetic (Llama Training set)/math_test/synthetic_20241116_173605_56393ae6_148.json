    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, it seems like a basic percentage and fraction problem, but as with any math problem, it's important to take it step-by-step, ensuring we're doing things correctly.\n\nFirst, let's restate the problem to make sure we understand it: We need to find what 50% of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of 36 is. This involves understanding both percentage and fraction operations.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n1. **What does the problem remind me of?**\n   It reminds me of problems that involve multiple operations, where you evaluate them sequentially. I need to find a part of a part\u2014it\u2019s a two-step operation.\n\n2. **Breaking it down**: \n   The problem is essentially saying there are three steps:\n   - Find \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of 36.\n   - Then find 50% of that result.\n\n### Step 1: Find \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of 36\n\n- \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of 36 means dividing 36 by 3. I need to do this calculation first.\n- Calculation: \\(36 \\div 3 = 12\\).\n\nAm I confident about this? Yeah, dividing 36 by 3 seems straightforward. Looking back, I don't see any mistakes. Onward!\n\n### Step 2: Find 50% of 12\n\n- Now, take the result from the first step (which is 12).\n- Finding 50% of 12 means dividing 12 by 2 or multiplying by 0.5.\n- Calculation: \\(12 \\times 0.5 = 6\\).\n  \nLet's check this quickly: 50% is the same as half, so dividing by 2 gives \\(12 \\div 2 = 6\\). That sounds right.\n\n### Reflection & Verification\n- Does my approach make sense? In each step, I simplified the fractions and percentages correctly.\n- Does the answer make sense in the context of the problem? Yes, it feels reasonable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final answer to \"What is 50% of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of 36?\" is 6.\n\nI'm quite confident in this solution because each individual calculation checked out, and the steps logically followed each other. It feels like a simple problem in hindsight, but I made sure not to rush and double-checked at each stage.",
