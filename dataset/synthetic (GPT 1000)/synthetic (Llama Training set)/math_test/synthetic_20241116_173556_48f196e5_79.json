    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this step-by-step. When I first see this problem, I sense it's asking for a common factor scenario, specifically finding the smallest number that can be fully divided by 16, 15, and 12. It feels a lot like problems I've done involving the least common multiple (LCM) because we want a number that all these numbers are factors of.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n- We're looking for the smallest positive integer that has 16, 15, and 12 as factors. That's another way of saying, what is the smallest number divisible by 16, 15, and 12? \n- This is a typical LCM problem, and I've worked through a lot of these. If a number is divisible by other numbers, it means each of those numbers is a factor, which matches the description of an LCM.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying a Strategy**\n\n- My first strategy is to simply find the LCM of 16, 15, and 12.\n- To calculate the LCM, I usually start with the prime factorization of each number because it's straightforward and shows a clear path to the solution.\n\n**Step 3: Prime Factorization**\n\n- **16**: It's a power of 2. So, \\(16 = 2^4\\).\n- **15**: This is a product of two primes. So, \\(15 = 3 \\times 5\\).\n- **12**: This breaks down to \\(12 = 2^2 \\times 3\\).\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the LCM**\n\n- The LCM is determined by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in any of the factorizations.\n- From the factorizations:\n  - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^4\\) from 16.\n  - The highest power of 3 is \\(3^1\\) from both 15 and 12.\n  - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^1\\) from 15.\n\n- Therefore, the LCM is: \n  \\[\n  LCM = 2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 16 \\times 3 \\times 5\n  \\]\n\n**Step 5: Performing the Multiplication**\n\n- Multiply these together:  \n\n  - Start with \\(16 \\times 3 = 48\\).\n  - Then, multiply the result by 5: \\(48 \\times 5 = 240\\).\n\n**Step 6: Quick Reflection and Confirmation**\n\n- 240 should be the smallest number divisible by 16, 15, and 12. But I want to double-check each:\n  - \\(240 \\div 16 = 15\\) \u2013 correct.\n  - \\(240 \\div 15 = 16\\) \u2013 correct.\n  - \\(240 \\div 12 = 20\\) \u2013 correct.\n\n- Everything checks out. All divisions yield integer results, confirming that each is a factor.\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer**\n\nThe smallest positive integer that has 16, 15, and 12 as factors is 240. This makes sense given the steps, and I'm confident it's correct given all the checks. \n\nActually, it's intriguing how LCM problems often involve finding the intersection of multiple sequences or patterns, really feeling akin to weaving threads together to form something uniform like we've done here!",

  "ground_truth": "We are asked to find the least common multiple of 16, 15, and 12.  Prime factorizing these three numbers as $2^4$, $3\\cdot5$, and $2^2\\cdot 3$, we find that a common multiple must have at least four twos, one three, and one five in its prime factorization.  Therefore, the least common multiple is $2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5=\\boxed{240}$."
