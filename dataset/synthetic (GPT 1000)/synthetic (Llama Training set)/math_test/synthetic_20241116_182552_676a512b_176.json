    "working_out": "Alright, let's start by carefully understanding the problem presented. We have a circle with center \\(O\\) and two diameters \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\). They're intersecting at point \\(O\\), which is the center of the circle. The question states that angle \\(AOD\\) measures \\(54\\) degrees. We need to find the measure of angle \\(AOB\\).\n\n### Initial thoughts\n\n1. **Understanding the setup:**\n   - Since \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are diameters, they are straight lines going through the center \\(O\\), hence, \\(\\angle AOC\\) and \\(\\angle BOD\\) should each be \\(180\\) degrees.\n   - The circle's symmetry should play a role here, given how diameters divide circles.\n\n2. **What do we know already?**\n   - \\(\\angle AOD = 54^\\circ\\).\n   - \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) being diameters means they are perpendicular to each other, intersecting at \\(O\\). Thus, they form right angles with each other.\n\n3. **Connections and reminders:**\n   - We might need to use the fact that opposite angles formed by intersecting lines in a circle must sum to \\(180^\\circ\\) or utilize properties of angles subtended by diameters.\n\n### Brainstorming Solution Steps\n\n- **Given that \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are diameters**, they intersect orthogonally (perpendicularly). Therefore, they form a right angle at \\(O\\), i.e., \\(\\angle AOB = 90^\\circ\\).\n\n- **Understanding \\(\\angle AOD = 54^\\circ\\)**:\n  - Knowing \\(\\angle AOD\\), could it affect \\(\\angle AOB\\) directly as  \\(\\angle AOD\\) is an internal angle between the diameters but note we are focusing on point O intersections with respect to circle's center.\n\n- **Checking through geometry**:\n  - \\(\\angle AOD\\) being \\(54^\\circ\\) implies \\(\\angle DOB = \\angle BOC = 36^\\circ\\) since the entire \\(\\angle AOB\\) is \\(90^\\circ\\) shared equally by \\(\\angle AOD\\) and \\(\\angle BOC\\) because it leads up to perpendicular diameters.\n\n### Verify and conclude\n\n- **Re-calculate if needed:**\n  - \\(\\angle AOB = \\angle AOD + \\angle DOB = 54^\\circ + 36^\\circ = 90^\\circ\\).\n\nChecking it mathematically fits and matches the geometric intuitions, reinforcing what was initially thought.\n\nThus, the measure of angle \\(AOB\\) is \\(90\\) degrees.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous reasoning. Let's re-examine the problem and integrate a correct approach.\n\n### Re-evaluation of the Problem\n\nWe have a circle with center \\(O\\) and diameters \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\). We're given that angle \\(AOD\\) measures \\(54^\\circ\\), and we need to find the measure of angle \\(AOB\\).\n\n### Clarifying the Geometry with New Insights\n\nIn my initial solution, I incorrectly assumed that diameters \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) were perpendicular to each other. However, this isn't necessarily true unless specified, so we need to revisit the problem with a clear understanding:\n\n1. **Recognizing Key Properties:**\n   - \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are diameters, meaning they both pass through the center \\(O\\) and span the circle.\n   - Angle \\(\\angle AOD = 54^\\circ\\) is given, which lies between the lines formed by diameters \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\).\n   \n2. **Exploring Angle Relationships:**\n   - Since \\(AOD\\) is formed by intersecting diameters, opposite angles around the intersection at \\(O\\) must add up to \\(180^\\circ\\), due to straight line geometry.\n   - Thus, \\(AOD\\) and \\(AOB\\) are supplementary, meaning they must sum to \\(180^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Calculating \\(AOB\\):**\n   - Given \\(\\angle AOD = 54^\\circ\\), we can use the supplementary angle property: \n   \\[\n   \\angle AOB = 180^\\circ - \\angle AOD = 180^\\circ - 54^\\circ = 126^\\circ.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nUpon reconsideration and using correct geometric reasoning, the measure of angle \\(AOB\\) is \\(126\\) degrees. The supplementary angles relationship was the key insight to solving this correctly. This approach validates that \\(AOD\\) and \\(AOB\\) indeed sum to form a straight line, leading to \\(\\boxed{126}\\) degrees for angle \\(AOB\\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial reasoning. Let's take a step back and re-evaluate the problem from a fresh perspective.\n\n### Revisiting the Problem:\nWe have a circle with center \\(O\\) and diameters \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\). The angle \\(AOD\\) is given as \\(54^\\circ\\), and we need to determine the measure of angle \\(AOB\\).\n\n### Rethinking the Approach:\n1. **Understanding the Geometry:**\n   - Since \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) are diameters, they each form straight lines through the center \\(O\\).\n   - The angle \\(AOD\\) is formed by these intersecting diameters.\n\n2. **Exploring Supplementary Angles:**\n   - My initial thought about the diameters being perpendicular was incorrect. Instead, let's consider the angles formed at point \\(O\\).\n   - In a circle, when two diameters intersect, they form linear pairs around the center. This means that angles on opposite sides of the intersection are supplementary.\n\n3. **Applying Supplementary Angle Properties:**\n   - Given angle \\(\\angle AOD = 54^\\circ\\), it must be supplemented to \\(180^\\circ\\) by angle \\(\\angle AOB\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(\\angle AOB = 180^\\circ - \\angle AOD = 180^\\circ - 54^\\circ = 126^\\circ\\).\n\n### Verification and Conclusion:\nUpon revisiting the problem with this corrected understanding, angle \\(AOB\\) indeed measures \\(\\boxed{126}\\) degrees. The key insight was recognizing the supplementary nature of angles formed by intersecting diameters at the center of the circle.\n\nBy re-evaluating our approach and using the supplementary angle property, we've arrived at the correct solution. This method confirms that the setup of diameters and the given angle \\(AOD\\) naturally lead to the deduction that angle \\(AOB\\) measures \\(126\\) degrees.",
