    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: finding the remainder of 71 when divided by 3.\n\n### First Thoughts:\n\nOkay, so the goal here is to determine the remainder when 71 is divided by 3, which is represented as \\( 71 \\mod 3 \\). This is a basic problem of division and modular arithmetic. \n\nInitially, I\u2019m thinking that this looks like a problem of division where I have to determine how many full groups of 3 fit into 71 and then see what's left over. I remember doing operations like this before, so it feels familiar.\n\n### Exploring Strategies:\n\n1. **Long Division Approach**:\n   - Start by dividing 71 by 3. \n   - If I perform the division, I should get a quotient and a remainder. The remainder is what we\u2019re interested in.\n\n2. **Mental Math**:\n   - Noticing quickly that 71 divided by 3 isn\u2019t immediately obvious quick math for me, but I recall from experience that breaking down into smaller steps can help.\n\n3. **Multiplication Approach**:\n   - Calculate how many times 3 goes into numbers close to 71 without exceeding it.\n\n### Attempting Long Division:\n\nLet\u2019s break down 71:\n\n- In division, we take 71 and divide by 3 to find the quotient and remainder.\n- Divide: \\( 71 \\div 3 = \\)\n- Trying to divide: 3 fits into 7 two times, giving us 6. Subtraction gives 1, bring down the next digit.\n- Now consider 11. 3 fits into 11 three times (3 x 3 = 9), subtraction gives remainder 2.\n\n**Check**: Quotient: 23, Remainder: 2\n\n### Reflecting:\n- The division seems correct because calculating \\( 23 \\times 3 + 2 = 69 + 2 = 71 \\).\n- Since our initial value is reconstructed from quotient, remainder confirmation shows correctness. This checks out.\n\n### Alternate Mental Check:\nLet\u2019s verify through smaller calculations:\n- \\( 3 \\times 20 = 60 \\)\n- \\( 3 \\times 23 = 69 \\), and 71 - 69 = 2.\n\nSo 69 is the nearest multiple of 3 that doesn\u2019t exceed 71, confirming 71 mod 3 equals 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter performing division, re-visiting multiplication steps, and verifying the value, I'm convinced the remainder \\( 71 \\mod 3 \\) is indeed 2.\n\nI've gone through a couple of strategies to double-check, and all road leads back to 2. This gives solid confidence in the result.",
