    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The question revolves around inverse trigonometric functions, specifically using the properties of the arctan function. We're given:\n\n\\[\n\\tan^{-1} x + \\tan^{-1} y = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n\\]\n\nand we're asked to find \\(xy + x + y\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n\n1. **Recognizing the Identity**: My first thought is that there's an identity for the sum of inverse tangents: \n   \\[\n   \\tan^{-1} a + \\tan^{-1} b = \\tan^{-1} \\left(\\frac{a + b}{1 - ab}\\right)\n   \\]\n   for \\( -1 < ab < 1 \\).\n\n2. **Using the Given Information**: Since the left side equals \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), and we know that \\(\\tan\\frac{\\pi}{4} = 1\\), we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x+y}{1-xy} = 1\n   \\]\n   This seems like a promising approach because it directly incorporates the given condition. Let me try working this out.\n\n### Working Through the Equation:\n\n3. **Solving the Equation**: If \\(\\frac{x+y}{1-xy} = 1\\), then:\n   \\[\n   x + y = 1 - xy\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   xy + x + y = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verifying**: I should verify this by considering if the conditions of use were met, and if I correctly manipulated the algebra.\n\n   - The identity is valid if \\(-1 < xy < 1\\). Since I've not been given explicit values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), I need to make sure the solution holds under this assumption. However, given that derivatives exist and the problem doesn\u2019t lead to contradictions, this should hold for acceptable values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n5. **Solution Check**: After arranging and checking, everything holds up logically. I substituted back into the calculations and didn\u2019t see any errors in the algebraic manipulations.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe calculated expression \\(xy + x + y = 1\\) seems reliable provided \\(xy\\) stays within the original constraints of not equaling 1 due to the division by zero possibility in the sum formula. As there isn't more specific information on \\(x\\) or \\(y\\), \\(xy + x + y = 1\\) is our final, generalized answer for the conditions given.\n\nI feel confident about this answer given the steps and logical progression. I checked all algebra and conditions, which match the initial given equation. If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) work within the allowable domains, this answer is consistent and accurate.",

  "ground_truth": "Taking the tangent of both sides, we get $\\tan (\\tan^{-1} x + \\tan^{-1} y) = \\tan \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 1.$  Then from the tangent addition formula,\n\\[\\frac{x + y}{1 - xy} = 1.\\]Then $x + y = 1 - xy,$ so $xy + x + y = \\boxed{1}.$"
