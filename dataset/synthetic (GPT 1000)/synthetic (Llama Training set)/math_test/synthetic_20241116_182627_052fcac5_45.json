    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving the problem: \"How many distinct diagonals of a convex hexagon can be drawn?\"\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, my mind races back to some basic geometry concepts. I know a hexagon has six sides, so it should have more than just a few diagonals. The idea of diagonals makes me think about how they connect non-adjacent vertices. I recall there's a common combinatorial way of calculating diagonals for polygons.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Listing and Counting Directly**: I could try to draw a hexagon, label its vertices, and manually count the diagonals. This might give me a visual sense of the problem, but drawing accurately and ensuring I count all without missing any could be tedious and potentially prone to error.\n\n2. **Using a Formula**: I remember there's a shortcut formula for calculating the number of diagonals in any polygon, which sounds efficient. If I recall correctly, the formula is \\(\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of sides in the polygon.\n\n**Execution of Strategies:**\n\n- **Strategy 1 - Direct Listing**:  \n   I could label the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, and F. Starting from vertex A, it can connect to C, D, and E (but not B and F since they are adjacent). Repeating this logic for all vertices could work, but I realize counting each diagonal starting at every vertex could be repetitive. This could become cumbersome and increase the chances of double-counting, unlike with a polygon having fewer sides.\n\n- **Strategy 2 - Using The Formula**:  \n   This seems more systematic and less prone to human error from manual counting. Plugging the number of sides into the formula should simplify things. Let's try it:\n \n   \\[\n   \\frac{6(6-3)}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 3}{2} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9\n   \\]\n\n**Validation of the Solution:**\n\n- **Quick Check with Smaller Polygon**:  \n   Just to verify the formula, consider a pentagon (5 sides). If I apply the formula: \\(\\frac{5(5-3)}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 2}{2} = 5\\). Mentally visualizing or sketching a pentagon should show 5 diagonals, which checks out.\n\n- **Revisiting My Thoughts**:  \n   A hexagon should have the property that each vertex connects to 3 other vertices (excluding adjacent vertices and the vertex itself). Since there are 6 vertices, \\( \\frac{6 \\times 3}{2} = 9 \\) seems plausible. This matches both the formula and my manual understanding.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe formula \\(\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\\) swiftly and accurately gives the count. For a hexagon, this results in 9 distinct diagonals. Reflecting on both approaches adds confidence to the solution. This problem reminds me of the power of recognizing patterns in mathematics and the utility of combinatorial formulas.\n\n9 diagonals in total for a convex hexagon is our final, confident answer!",

  "ground_truth": "From each vertex $V$, we can draw 3 diagonals: one to each vertex that is not $V$ and does not share an edge with $V$.  There are 6 vertices in a hexagon, so we might be tempted to say the answer is $6\\times 3 = 18$.  However, note that this counts each diagonal twice, one time for each vertex.  Hence there are $\\frac{18}{2} = \\boxed{9}$ distinct diagonals in a convex hexagon."
