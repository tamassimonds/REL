    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We want to simplify the expression \\(3x + 2 - 5x + 18\\).\n\nFirst thoughts:\n- This looks like an algebra problem involving like terms. The expression has terms with \\(x\\) and constant numbers. \n- My gut instinct tells me to start by combining like terms. This seems like a straightforward simplification task.\n\nLet's explore different strategies:\n1. Combine like terms for \\(x\\).\n2. Simplify the constant numbers.\n3. Reassess if a different approach is needed.\n\n### Step-by-step walkthrough:\n\n**Step 1: Combine like terms for \\(x\\)**\n\nThe terms involving \\(x\\) here are \\(3x\\) and \\(-5x\\).\n\n- Thought process: I need to figure out the net coefficient for \\(x\\).\n- Calculation: \\(3x - 5x = (3 - 5)x = -2x\\).\n- Reflection: This seems correct because I've combined the \\(x\\) terms properly.\n\n**Check 1:**\n- Quick check: \\(3x\\) and \\(-5x\\) subtracted should indeed give a negative \\(x\\) term since 5 is more than 3. Yes, \\(-2x\\) feels right.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the constant numbers.**\n\nThe constant numbers here are \\(2\\) and \\(18\\).\n\n- Thought process: Simply add these values as there's no negative involved for simplicity.\n- Calculation: \\(2 + 18 = 20\\).\n- Reflection: I should have correctly added these constants since they both have the same sign.\n\n**Check 2:**\n- Quick check: Adding \\(2\\) and \\(18\\) once again mentally. Yep, \\(20\\) seems perfect.\n\n**Step 3: Combine results from steps 1 and 2**\n\nI now have:\n- From Step 1: \\(-2x\\)\n- From Step 2: \\(20\\)\n\nCombine into one expression:\n- Thought process: Just write them together in standard mathematical form.\n- Re-check: \\(-2x + 20\\), there's nothing else to simplify, as one part is with \\(x\\) and the other is a constant.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- I think the simplification looks good. The algebra was basic, mainly about combining like terms.\n- I'll do a mental recap: Any chance I missed a step or miscalculated something? Nope, seems aligned.\n  \n### Conclusion:\nThe simplified form of the expression \\(3x + 2 - 5x + 18\\) is \\(-2x + 20\\).\n\nThis feels correct as I've logically gone through combining the same types of terms and did the arithmetic carefully. Pretty straightforward, but it's always good to ensure each piece fits!",
