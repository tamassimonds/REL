    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think it through step by step. \n\nFirst, let's write down and understand the given equation: \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x-1} + \\frac{2x}{x-1} = 5\n\\]\n\n## Brainstorming Initial Strategies\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Combine Fractions**: My immediate thought is that since both terms have a common denominator, I can combine them. This might simplify the expression.\n\n2. **Isolate \\(x\\)**: Once combined, manipulate the equation to isolate \\(x\\). However, I should be careful about the restrictions, since any operations should not violate mathematical principles, e.g., division by zero.\n\n3. **Look for Simplicity**: Look for any simpler methods to solve by factoring or simplifying expressions initially if possible. \n\n## Implementing a Plan\n\n**Step 1: Combine the Fractions**\n\nBoth fractions in the left-hand side of the equation already have the same denominator \\(x-1\\). We can combine them:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 + 2x}{x-1} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This looks correct. Now I have a single fraction, which is easier to work with. But, I need to remember here that \\(x \\neq 1\\), since the denominator \\(x-1\\) would be zero in that case.\n\n**Step 2: Eliminate the Denominator**\n\nTo get rid of the fraction, multiply both sides by \\((x-1)\\):\n\n\\[\n1 + 2x = 5(x - 1)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This seems to be in good shape. Multiplying both sides by the denominator avoids division by zero (as long as \\(x \\neq 1\\)) and simplifies the equation.\n\n**Step 3: Expand and Simplify**\n\nLet's distribute the 5 on the right side:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2x = 5x - 5\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Rearrange to Solve for \\(x\\)**\n\nMove all terms involving \\(x\\) to one side and constants to the opposite side:\n\n\\[\n1 + 5 = 5x - 2x \n\\]\n\nSimplifying the equation gives:\n\n\\[\n6 = 3x\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Solve for \\(x\\)**\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = 2\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check of the Solution**\n\nPlug \\(x = 2\\) back into the original equation to ensure correctness:\n\nLeft Side: \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2-1} + \\frac{4}{2-1} = 1 + 4 = 5\n\\]\n\nRight Side: \n\\[\n5\n\\]\n\nBoth sides are equal, which verifies that \\(x = 2\\) is a solution.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMy computation shows that the only value that satisfies the equation given the domain of the original problem is \\(x = 2\\). The reflection throughout each step confirmed our path, with special attention given to the restriction \\(x \\neq 1\\) at the start due to the division involved.",

  "ground_truth": "We can combine the two terms on the left side to get $\\dfrac{1+2x}{x-1} = 5$.  We then multiply both sides of this equation by $x-1$ to get rid of the fractions.   This gives us $1+2x = 5(x-1)$. Expanding the right side gives $1+2x = 5x -5$.  Subtracting $5x$ from both sides   gives $1-3x = -5$, and subtracting 1 from both sides of this equation yields $-3x = -6$.  Dividing both sides   of this equation by $-3$ gives us our answer, $x = \\boxed{2}$."
