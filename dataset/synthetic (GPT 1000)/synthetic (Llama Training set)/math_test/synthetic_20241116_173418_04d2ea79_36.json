    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this interesting problem. \n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nWe're given that \n\\[\n\\log_a b + \\log_b c + \\log_c a = 0\n\\]\nand asked to find\n\\[\n(\\log_a b)^3 + (\\log_b c)^3 + (\\log_c a)^3.\n\\]\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of sum-related identities or expressions. Perhaps using properties of logarithms or even exploring the symmetry might help. I need to find a particular method that elegantly simplifies the expression using the given equation.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the Problem Deeply**\n\nGiven the symmetry and the nature of logarithms, one possible approach is to use the change of base formula in the equation. This might help tease out relationships or simplifications.\n\nUsing the change of base formula:\n\\[ \n\\log_a b = \\frac{\\log b}{\\log a}, \\quad \\log_b c = \\frac{\\log c}{\\log b}, \\quad \\log_c a = \\frac{\\log a}{\\log c}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into the original equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log b}{\\log a} + \\frac{\\log c}{\\log b} + \\frac{\\log a}{\\log c} = 0.\n\\]\n\nHmm, this reminds me of cyclic sums and potential symmetry! Let's try multiplying through by \\(\\log a \\cdot \\log b \\cdot \\log c\\) to clear denominators:\n\\[\n(\\log b)(\\log c) + (\\log c)(\\log a) + (\\log a)(\\log b) = 0.\n\\]\n\nOh, this is symmetric and might lead me to something neat!\n\n**Step 3: Use Insights to Simplify Further**\n\nThe expression above satisfies zero sum of products, which looks like a fruitful symmetry. Additionally, we have cyclic relationships very akin to those found in polynomial roots or symmetric polynomials. \n\nLet's set \\(x = \\log_a b\\), \\(y = \\log_b c\\), and \\(z = \\log_c a\\).\nSo, \\(x + y + z = 0\\) and we have our target expression as \\(x^3 + y^3 + z^3\\).\n\nThe identity for cubes which might be handy here is:\n\\[\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3xyz \\quad \\text{when} \\quad x + y + z = 0.\n\\]\n\nNice, now let's retarget to find \\(xyz\\).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate \\(xyz\\)**\n\nFrom the definition:\n\\[\nx = \\log_a b, \\quad y = \\log_b c, \\quad z = \\log_c a.\n\\]\n\nBy properties of logarithms, we know:\n\\[\nxy = \\log_a b \\cdot \\log_b c = \\log_a c\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nxyz = \\log_a b \\cdot \\log_b c \\cdot \\log_c a = (\\log_a c)(\\log_c a) = 1,\n\\]\nbecause \\(\\log_a c \\cdot \\log_c a = 1\\) for any \\(x\\) by definition of logarithm inverse properties.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude**\n\nBy using the identity \\(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3xyz\\) given \\(x + y + z = 0\\), and knowing that \\(xyz = 1\\), we find:\n\\[\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3.\n\\]\n\nFinal answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}.\n\\]\n\nThe logic flows smoothly, starting from a reassessment of the symmetry in the initial condition to taking advantage of well-known identities and logarithmic properties. I feel confident about this result, but will survey through again for assurance... And yes! It aligns well, so \\(\\boxed{3}\\) it is!",
