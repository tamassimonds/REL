    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n- We're given a rhombus.\n- A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all four sides of equal length.\n- We need to find the perimeter, which is the total distance around the rhombus.\n- Instead of side lengths, we're given the lengths of the diagonals: 12 units and 16 units. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- I remember something about the diagonals of a rhombus being perpendicular bisectors of each other. This might be useful.\n- Since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, each half acts as legs of a right triangle, with a side of the rhombus being the hypotenuse.\n- This seems like a problem where the Pythagorean theorem could be applied.\n\n**Strategy Exploration:**\n- Strategy 1: Use the properties of the diagonals to find the side length. \n- Strategy 2: If side lengths were given, compute perimeter directly, but they aren't.\n- Strategy 3: Use known theorems or properties, such as Pythagorean theorem or the relationship between diagonals and sides in a rhombus.\n\n**Going Deeper with Strategy 1:**\n- The diagonals are 12 and 16 units. They create four right-angled triangles within the rhombus.\n- Each triangle has legs of \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\) units and \\( \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\) units, because the diagonals bisect each other.\n\n**Utilizing the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n- Let's label the legs of the right triangle: \\( a = 6 \\), \\( b = 8 \\).\n- By the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse (which is a side of the rhombus) is:\n  \\[\n  c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 64} = \\sqrt{100} = 10 \\text{ units}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflecting on Our Approach:**\n- That makes sense, since the diagonals create perfectly symmetrical right triangles.\n- The side length calculation seems correct based on what I recall about right triangles.\n\n**Calculating the Perimeter:**\n- Each side of the rhombus is 10 units.\n- A rhombus has four equal sides, so perimeter, \\( P \\), is:\n  \\[\n  P = 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\text{ units}\n  \\]\n  \n**Final Thoughts and Checks:**\n- Quick reality check: the calculations unraveled logically.\n- The hypotenuse of a 6-8 right triangle being 10 is indeed consistent with the Pythagorean triples I remember.\n- Given that each side is 10 units and there are four sides, adding up to 40 units intuitively makes sense.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the rhombus is 40 units. This approach feels quite solid, considering the properties of geometric shapes involved here.",

  "ground_truth": "Because the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, they divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.  The legs of one of these triangles measure $12/2=6$ and $16/2=8$ units.  Therefore, the hypotenuse of each triangle measures $\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$ units.  Since the side length of the rhombus is equal to the length of the hypotenuse of one of the triangles, the perimeter of the rhombus is $4\\cdot 10=\\boxed{40}$ units.
