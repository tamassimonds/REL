    "working_out": "First, I'll start by understanding the problem. The question asks for the second smallest positive integer \\( x \\) such that the fraction \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 + x}\\) is a terminating decimal. A terminating decimal, in its simplest form, is a decimal with a finite number of digits after the decimal point. For a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) to be a terminating decimal when reduced to its simplest form, the denominator \\( q \\) can only have the prime factors 2 and 5.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Denominator**\n\nThe denominator in our fraction \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 + x}\\) is \\( x^2 + x = x(x + 1) \\). Since \\( x \\) and \\( x + 1 \\) are consecutive integers, they are coprime, meaning they share no common factors other than 1. For \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 + x}\\) to be a terminating decimal, both numbers \\( x \\) and \\( x + 1 \\) must be made out of the prime factors 2 and 5.\n\n**Reflection:** \n- \\( x \\) and \\( x+1 \\) being coprime means they cannot both be divisible by the same non-trivial factor.\n- This realization simplifies the task to checking individual possibilities for \\( x \\) and \\( x + 1 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Exploring possibilities**\n\nLet's test small values of \\( x \\):\n\n- For \\( x = 1 \\): \n  - \\( x^2 + x = 1^2 + 1 = 2 \\)\n  - \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is a terminating decimal.\n- For \\( x = 2 \\): \n  - \\( x^2 + x = 2^2 + 2 = 6 \\)\n  - \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) is not a terminating decimal.\n- For \\( x = 3 \\):\n  - \\( x^2 + x = 3^2 + 3 = 12 \\)\n  - \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) is not a terminating decimal.\n- For \\( x = 4 \\):\n  - \\( x^2 + x = 4^2 + 4 = 20 \\)\n  - \\(\\frac{1}{20}\\) is a terminating decimal.\n\n**Reflection after Testing Cases:**\n- From these cases, \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 + x}\\) is a terminating decimal for \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the second smallest integer**\n\nGiven my results, I see that the smallest integer solution is \\( x = 1\\) where \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is indeed a terminating decimal. The second smallest \\( x \\) is \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe second smallest integer \\( x \\) such that \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 + x}\\) is a terminating decimal is \\( x = 4 \\). This wraps up our reasoning and confirms our solution through logical deduction and testing initial values.",

  "ground_truth": "We can factor $\\frac{1}{x^2+x} = \\frac{1}{x(x+1)}$. Therefore, we want both $x$ and $x+1$ to be divisible by 2 and 5. They cannot both be even, so we have that either $x$ or $x+1$ is odd, so either $x$ or $x+1$ is a power of 5. We start by considering the power $5^0 = 1$. If $x=1$, we have the fraction $\\frac{1}{2}$, which terminates. If $x+1=1$, we get $x=0$, but then we have an invalid fraction. We now consider the power $5^1 = 5$. If $x=5$, we have the fraction $\\frac{1}{30}$, which repeats due to the factor of 3 in the denominator. If $x+1 = 5$, then $x=4$, so the fraction is $\\frac{1}{20} = 0.05$. The second smallest integer $x$ such that $\\frac{1}{x^2+x}$ is a terminating decimal is $x = \\boxed{4}$."
