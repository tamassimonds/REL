    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n**First Impressions:**\n- This problem looks like it involves ratios and percentages, which can sometimes be tricky to untangle.\n- Hmm, we have two groups (A and B) splitting candy in different proportions. My instinct is that we'll need to work with proportions and fractions.\n- The end goal is to find the fraction representing the ratio of candies between two students, one from each group. I have a feeling this is going to involve some algebra to solve for the variables representing the candy per student.\n\n**Initial Strategy:**\n- First, let's break down what percentage of the class is in each group. This seems straightforward since we're given 80% and 20% directly.\n- Just to double-check, their sum should be 100%, which it is. So, no mistakes there.\n- My goal is to figure out the exact amount of candy each student in both groups receives, given that the total candy is split into two different percentages (40% and 60%) equally among the students within each group.\n\n**Let's Start Digging:**\n\n1. **Set Up the Problem:**\n   - Let\u2019s assume there are \\( N \\) students in total. So, 80% of \\( N \\) is the number of students in group A, and 20% of \\( N \\) is the number in group B.\n   - It might be easier to just pick a number for \\( N \\) to make it tangible. If \\( N = 100 \\), then there are 80 students in group A and 20 in group B. Let's go with that for now; we can always switch back to variables if needed.\n\n2. **Define Candy Amounts:**\n   - Assume the total amount of candy is \\( C \\). Group A gets 40% of \\( C \\), and Group B gets 60% of \\( C \\).\n   - This means Group A gets \\( 0.4C \\) candy, and Group B gets \\( 0.6C \\) candy.\n\n3. **Candy Per Student:**\n   - For Group A: Each student gets \\(\\frac{0.4C}{80}\\).\n   - For Group B: Each student gets \\(\\frac{0.6C}{20}\\).\n\n**Checking Progress:**\n- Let\u2019s simplify these expressions because they look a bit complex:\n  - Group A\u2019s candy per student = \\(\\frac{0.4C}{80} = \\frac{C}{200}\\).\n  - Group B\u2019s candy per student = \\(\\frac{0.6C}{20} = \\frac{3C}{100}\\).\n\n**Calculate the Ratio:**\n- Now, we need to find the ratio of the amount of candy a student in group A gets to the amount a student in group B gets.\n  - Ratio = \\(\\frac{\\frac{C}{200}}{\\frac{3C}{100}}\\).\n\n**Simplifying the Ratio:**\n- Hmm, at a glance, this looks complex, but let's simplify it step by step.\n- Cancel out \\( C \\) from numerator and denominator, since it appears in both.\n- Multiply numerators and denominators by 200 to make it easier:\n  - So, the ratio becomes \\(\\frac{1 \\cdot 100}{3 \\cdot 200} = \\frac{100}{600} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\n**Final Thoughts and Conclusion:**\n- This indeed seems correct. I notice my earlier assumption (choosing \\( N = 100 \\)) didn't affect the general solution pattern, since the algebra here handles it for any \\( N \\).\n- Also, I paused to make sure the simplification makes sense at each stage, just like I would naturally talk through as if on paper.\n\nSo, the ratio of the amount of candy a student in Group A receives to a student in Group B is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\n**Aha Moment:**\n- Realizing that simplifying earlier with constants removes complexity was key here. I could have stayed with variables, but numbers helped clarify the ratio's reduction path.\n\nAll in all, this step-by-step approach and careful reflection seem to have led us to a satisfactory conclusion!",

  "ground_truth": "Suppose that there are $c$ pieces of candy total shared by $s$ students in the class. In group A, there are $.8 \\cdot s$ students sharing $.4 \\cdot c$ pieces of candy. Dividing the two, we have $\\frac{.4c \\textnormal{ pieces of candy}}{.8s \\textnormal{ students}}$, or $.5\\frac{c}{s}$ pieces of candy per student. In group B, there are $.2 \\cdot s$ students sharing $.6 \\cdot c$ pieces of candy. Dividing the two, we have $\\frac{.6c \\textnormal{ pieces of candy}}{.2s \\textnormal{ students}}$, or $3\\frac{c}{s}$ pieces of candy per student. The ratio between the pieces of candy per student in group A and that in group B is $\\frac{.5\\frac{c}{s}}{3\\frac{c}{s}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$."
