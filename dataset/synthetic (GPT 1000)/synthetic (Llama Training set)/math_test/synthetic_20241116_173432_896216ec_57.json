    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this. The problem asks us to find a monic quadratic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) such that \\( P(\\sqrt{13} - 3) = 0 \\). We're also told that the coefficients should be integers, and \"monic\" means the leading coefficient should be 1. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- \"This looks similar to problems involving algebraic numbers. If \\( \\sqrt{13} - 3 \\) is a root, the other root should be something like \\( \\sqrt{13} + 3 \\) because that's its conjugate and it'll help form a polynomial with rational coefficients.\"\n- \"Maybe this is like those problems where we need to find a minimal polynomial. We often use conjugates to do this.\"\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n1. **Conjugate Approach:** \n   - If \\( \\sqrt{13} - 3 \\) is a root, then consider its conjugate \\( \\sqrt{13} + 3 \\). Creating a polynomial where these are the roots could help.\n   - The polynomial will be in the form \\( (x - (\\sqrt{13} - 3))(x - (\\sqrt{13} + 3)) \\).\n\n2. **Expand the Polynomial:**\n   - Start multiplying: \\( (x - (\\sqrt{13} - 3))(x - (\\sqrt{13} + 3)) = (x - \\sqrt{13} + 3)(x - \\sqrt{13} - 3) \\).\n   - Looks like a difference of squares: \\( (x - \\sqrt{13})^2 - 9 \\).\n\n3. **Check My Thoughts:**\n   - \"Hmm, this seems to match. I remember that difference of squares method from algebra.\"\n   - \"Let me expand it completely to see if it simplifies correctly.\"\n\n4. **Expand Further:**\n   - \\( (x - \\sqrt{13})^2 - 9 = (x^2 - 2x\\sqrt{13} + 13) - 9 \\)\n   - Simplify: \\( x^2 - 2x\\sqrt{13} + 4 \\).\n\n5. **Reflection on Integer Coefficients:**\n   - \"Wait, that can't be right because there's a \\( \\sqrt{13} \\) in the coefficients, and we're supposed to have integer coefficients.\"\n   - \"Let\u2019s back up... Maybe I misunderstood. I think my initial understanding was correct about the form being \\( x^2 - 6x - 4 \\). I need the cross terms to cancel.\"\n\n### Polynomial Completion:\n\n- Maybe if I let \\( y = \\sqrt{13} \\), then \\( x = y - 3 \\):\n  - Re-try setup: \\( ((y - 3) - y)((y - 3) + y) \\) simplifies to \\( x = y - 3 \\).\n\n- Express \\( \\sqrt{13} \\) in terms of \\( x \\):\n  - If \\( x = \\sqrt{13} - 3 \\), then \\( x + 3 = \\sqrt{13} \\).\n\n- Square both sides:\n  - \\( x^2 + 6x + 9 = 13 \\).\n\n- Simplify:\n  - \\( x^2 + 6x - 4 = 0 \\).\n\n### Check My Work\n\n- \"Okay, wow! I think I got it: \\( x^2 + 6x - 4 = 0 \\). Let me verify by plugging \\( \\sqrt{13} - 3 \\) back in to check any computation errors.\"\n- Substitute:\n  - Let \\( x = \\sqrt{13} - 3 \\)\n  - \\( (\\sqrt{13} - 3)^2 + 6(\\sqrt{13} - 3) - 4 = 0 \\)\n  - Simplifies to \\( 13 - 6 \\sqrt{13} + 9 + 6\\sqrt{13} - 18 - 4 = 0 \\).\n\n- \"Yes! It works. Okay, \\( x^2 + 6x - 4 \\) is the polynomial I need.\"\n\nMy final answer is: \n\n\\[ P(x) = x^2 + 6x - 4 \\]",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x = \\sqrt{13} - 3.$  Then $x + 3 = \\sqrt{13},$ so\n\\[(x + 3)^2 = 13.\\]This simplifies to $x^2 + 6x - 4 = 0,$ so we can take $P(x) = \\boxed{x^2 + 6x - 4}.$"
