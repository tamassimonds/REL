    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s tackle this problem step by step, as if I\u2019m working through it naturally. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - I\u2019m given the sides of a triangle: \\( AB = 15 \\), \\( AC = 41 \\), and \\( BC = 52 \\).\n   - I need to find the radius of the circle inscribed within this triangle, also known as the inradius.\n\n2. **What Do I Remember?**\n   - The formula to find the inradius \\( r \\) of a triangle given its area \\( A \\) and semi-perimeter \\( s \\) is:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{A}{s}\n     \\]\n   - The semi-perimeter \\( s \\) of the triangle is:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = \\frac{15 + 41 + 52}{2}\n     \\]\n   - So, let's calculate \\( s \\).\n\n**Calculating the Semi-perimeter:**\n\n\\[ \ns = \\frac{15 + 41 + 52}{2} = \\frac{108}{2} = 54\n\\]\n\n3. **Pause and Reflect:**\n   - Okay, I have the semi-perimeter. Now I need the area of the triangle. The usual \"semi-perimeter\" approach using Heron\u2019s formula seems appropriate:\n     \\[\n     A = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)}\n     \\]\n   - Let's calculate it.\n\n**Calculate the Area Using Heron's Formula:**\n\n- First, calculate \\( s - AB \\), \\( s - AC \\), and \\( s - BC \\):\n  \\[\n  s - AB = 54 - 15 = 39\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  s - AC = 54 - 41 = 13\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  s - BC = 54 - 52 = 2\n  \\]\n\n- Now, plug into Heron's formula:\n  \\[\n  A = \\sqrt{54 \\times 39 \\times 13 \\times 2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This seems like a rather unwieldy multiplication but let's proceed and see where it gets us. It might be simpler with a calculator, or maybe there\u2019s a simpler factorization if I check any prime factors.\n\n\\[ \nA = \\sqrt{54 \\times 39 \\times 13 \\times 2}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying further can be:**\n\n- Break it down as:\n  \\[\n  54 = 2 \\times 3^3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  39 = 3 \\times 13\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  2 = 2\n  \\]\n\n- Combine:\n  \\[\n  2^2 \\times 3^4 \\times 13^2\n  \\]\n\n- Simplify under the square root:\n  \\[\n  A = \\sqrt{2^2 \\times 3^4 \\times 13^2} = 6 \\times 13 = 78\n  \\]\n\n**Area Calculation Result:** \n- \\( A = 78 \\)\n\n4. **Final Calculation for Radius:**\n\n- Substitute back into the inradius formula:\n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{A}{s} = \\frac{78}{54}\n  \\]\n\n- Simplify the fraction:\n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{39}{27} = \\frac{13}{9}\n  \\]\n\n**Wrap-Up and Verification:**\n\n- \\( r = \\frac{13}{9} \\)\n- Reflect: This seems sensible given the side lengths and the triangle's size.\n- The details check out. There's no odd number or oversight, and every part of the calculation flows logically to this result.\n\nIt's interesting because this approach made me delve deeply into Heron's formula and factorization, reminding me how algebraic manipulation can sometimes smooth out seemingly difficult arithmetic. Overall, this comprehensive verification shows that the calculated inradius of \\( \\frac{13}{9} \\) should be correctly accounted for in this context.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculations. Let's revisit the problem and correct it.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Problem:**\n\nGiven the sides of triangle \\(ABC\\) as \\(AB = 15\\), \\(AC = 41\\), and \\(BC = 52\\), our goal is to find the radius of the inscribed circle \\(r\\). Upon further reflection, I need to ensure the area calculation using Heron's formula is accurate and re-evaluate the result.\n\n**Correcting the Area Calculation:**\n\nPreviously, I had:\n\\[ \nA = \\sqrt{54 \\times 39 \\times 13 \\times 2} \n\\]\n\nBut I miscalculated this earlier. Let's go through the steps again for clarity:\n\n1. **Heron\u2019s Formula:**\n   \\[\n   A = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)}\n   \\]\n   Where \\(s = 54\\).\n\n2. **Substituting values into Heron's formula:**\n   \\[\n   A = \\sqrt{54 \\times 39 \\times 13 \\times 2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying:**\n   \\[\n   = \\sqrt{54 \\times 39 \\times 13 \\times 2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 13^2}\n   \\]\n\n   Here, previously I miscalculated this simplification. The correct simplification is:\n   \\[\n   = \\sqrt{(2 \\times 13)^2 \\cdot 3^4} \n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\sqrt{234^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 234\n   \\]\n\n**Re-calculating the Inradius \\(r\\):**\n\nNow that I have corrected the area \\(A = 234\\):\n\n\\[ \nr = \\frac{A}{s} = \\frac{234}{54} \n\\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction gives:\n\n\\[ \nr = \\frac{39}{9} = \\frac{13}{3} \n\\]\n\n**Reflection and Validation:**\n\nThe corrected area calculation leads to an inradius \\( r = \\frac{13}{3}\\). This matches the consistent logical approach and the calculations integral in ensuring the accurate solving of this problem. I initially overlooked the accurate simplification under the square root in Heron's formula, leading to the incorrect area. This highlights the importance of careful arithmetic and double-checking at each step.\n\nThus, the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle \\(ABC\\) is indeed \\( \\frac{13}{3} \\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculations. Let's revisit the problem and correct it. Upon double-checking my solution, I noticed that the simplification of the area under the square root using Heron's formula was incorrect. Let me go through the solution methodically again and ensure that each step is accurate.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Problem:**\n\nGiven the sides of triangle \\(ABC\\) as \\(AB = 15\\), \\(AC = 41\\), and \\(BC = 52\\), our goal is to find the radius of the inscribed circle \\(r\\). The inradius can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{A}{s}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(A\\) is the area of the triangle and \\(s\\) is the semi-perimeter. We've already determined that:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{15 + 41 + 52}{2} = 54\n\\]\n\n**Re-calculating the Area Using Heron's Formula:**\n\nTo find the area \\(A\\), we use Heron's formula:\n\n\\[\nA = \\sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n1. \\(s - AB = 54 - 15 = 39\\)\n2. \\(s - AC = 54 - 41 = 13\\)\n3. \\(s - BC = 54 - 52 = 2\\)\n\nNow, calculate the area:\n\n\\[\nA = \\sqrt{54 \\times 39 \\times 13 \\times 2}\n\\]\n\nUpon re-evaluation and careful simplification:\n\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 13^2}\n\\]\n\nThe correct simplification becomes:\n\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{(2 \\times 13)^2 \\cdot 3^4}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{234^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 234\n\\]\n\n**Final Calculation for the Inradius \\(r\\):**\n\nNow that we have the correct area \\(A = 234\\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{A}{s} = \\frac{234}{54}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction gives:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{39}{9} = \\frac{13}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection and Validation:**\n\nThe recalculation and verification confirm that the inradius \\( r = \\frac{13}{3} \\). This matches the logical approach and detailed breakdown involved in ensuring the accuracy of this solution. The previous error in the simplification under the square root in Heron's formula led to an incorrect area, highlighting the importance of careful arithmetic and double-checking each step.\n\nThus, the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle \\(ABC\\) is indeed \\( \\frac{13}{3} \\). This resolution aligns seamlessly with the correct application of Heron's formula and verification, reinforcing the conclusion with confident accuracy in tackling this geometric challenge.",
