    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We want to know how many total farthings are equivalent to \\(1\\) pound and \\(5\\) pence. So, let's break this down:\n\n### First Thoughts\n\nInitially, this seems like a conversion problem where we take monetary units in one form and convert them into another, specifically farthings. I've seen similar problems where the key is to carefully apply conversion rates, moving step by step through each currency type until we reach the desired unit. \n\nHowever, there's a bit of complexity because we have a mix of pounds and pence, and we need to remember the hierarchy in conversions.\n\n### Brainstorming a Plan\n\n1. **Convert the Pound to Shillings:** Since there are 20 shillings in a pound, this conversion should be straightforward.\n\n2. **Convert Shillings to Pence:** Using the fact that 12 pence make up one shilling, this should be our next step.\n\n3. **Convert the previously converted total in Pence:** Once we have everything in pence, we can convert the entire value to farthings since we're also given the conversion rate from pence to farthings.\n\n4. **Add the Extra 5 Pence:** Don\u2019t forget the 5 pence we need to handle separately but ultimately add to the full amount before converting to farthings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution\n\n1. **Convert 1 Pound to Shillings:**\n   - According to the conversion rate, \\(1 \\text{ pound} = 20 \\text{ shillings}\\).\n\n   Reflecting here, this part seems straightforward. I remember from earlier math problems these kinds of conversions are usually direct.\n\n2. **Convert Shillings to Pence:**\n   - Now, we take the previously determined \\(20 \\text{ shillings}\\) and convert them to pence using \\(12 \\text{ pence per shilling}\\):\n     \\[\n     20 \\text{ shillings} \\times 12 \\text{ pence per shilling} = 240 \\text{ pence}\n     \\]\n\n   Double-checking: Well, it seems consistent with the conversion method. If \\(1 \\text{ shilling} = 12 \\text{ pence}\\), it logically follows.\n\n3. **Handle the Extra 5 Pence:**\n   - We have an additional \\(5 \\text{ pence}\\), so we should simply add this to our existing pence total:\n     \\[\n     240 \\text{ pence} + 5 \\text{ pence} = 245 \\text{ pence}\n     \\]\n\n   Pause and reflect: This calculation feels right because we are ensuring the entirety of our amount is expressed in pence before heading to the next step.\n\n4. **Convert Total Pence to Farthings:**\n   - Finally, with the whole amount in pence (\\(245\\)), let's convert this to farthings. Using \\(4 \\text{ farthings per penny}\\), we should have:\n     \\[\n     245 \\text{ pence} \\times 4 \\text{ farthings per pence} = 980 \\text{ farthings}\n     \\]\n\n### Reflection and Verification\n\nLooking back at these calculations, each step follows directly from the problem's conversion factors, which adds confidence to the conclusion. Also, considering basic checks, like intuitive predictions about size (pence to farthings should multiply the quantity), the numbers feel reasonable.\n\nIt seems then, the total number of farthings equivalent to \\(1\\) pound and \\(5\\) pence is consequently \\(980\\). \n\nThe solution makes consistent use of conversion logic, and nothing stands out as overlooked or incorrect. Therefore, \\(980\\) farthings is our confirmed final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "Convert $1$ pound to farthings: \\[\n1\\mbox{ pound} \\times \\frac{20\\mbox{ shillings}}{1\\mbox{ pound}} \\times \\frac{12\\mbox{ pence}}{1\\mbox{ shilling}} \\times \\frac{4\\mbox{ farthings}}{1\\mbox{ pence}}\n= 960\\mbox{ farthings}.\n\\] The remaining $5$ pence is equal to $20$ farthings, so the total is $\\boxed{980}$ farthings."
