    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem about even functions and their product. Here's how I would think through it:\n\n### First Thoughts\n\n1. **Understanding Even Functions**: \n   - A function \\( f(x) \\) is even if for all \\( x \\) in its domain, \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\).\n   - Similarly, since \\( g(x) \\) is even, \\( g(-x) = g(x) \\).\n\n2. **What We Need to Find**: \n   - We need to determine whether the product \\( f(x)g(x) \\) is even, odd, or neither. \n\n3. **Initial Intuition**:\n   - This feels like it could be straightforward to check with a property of even functions. I remember that multiplying even functions might keep some of the even properties because of how symmetry works around the y-axis.\n\n### Strategy\n\n4. **Plan**:\n   - Let's use the definition of even functions in the context of the product:\n   - We need to evaluate \\( (f \\cdot g)(-x) \\) and see if it equals \\( (f \\cdot g)(x) \\).\n\n### Calculation\n\n5. **Evaluate \\( (f \\cdot g)(-x) \\)**:\n   - So, \\( (f \\cdot g)(-x) = f(-x) \\cdot g(-x) \\).\n\n6. **Substitute Even Function Properties**:\n   - Since both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) are even, \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) and \\( g(-x) = g(x) \\). Thus,\n   - \\( (f \\cdot g)(-x) = f(x) \\cdot g(x) \\).\n\n7. **Compare to \\( (f \\cdot g)(x) \\)**:\n   - We have \\( (f \\cdot g)(x) = f(x) \\cdot g(x) \\).\n   - Since \\( (f \\cdot g)(-x) = (f \\cdot g)(x) \\), the product \\( f(x)g(x) \\) is even.\n\n### Reflect and Confirm\n\n8. **Check the Logic**:\n   - By substituting \\( x \\) with \\(-x\\) and confirming that the product remains unchanged, I verified that the even property is retained.\n\n9. **Instinct Check**:\n   - I initially thought the product should retain the even property, and the calculations confirm this. If both components of the product are unchanged under substitution by \\(-x\\), their product should also remain unchanged.\n\n10. **Verification**:\n    - Think about examples or counterexamples: if \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) and \\( g(x) = x^4 \\), both functions are even, and their product \\( (x^2)(x^4) = x^6 \\) is also even.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n11. **Final Answer**:\n    - Based on the definition and calculations, the product \\( f(x)g(x) \\) is **even**.\n\nThis step-by-step breakdown shows the evolution of thought from general properties to specific calculations and conclusions. This answer comprehensively confirms the classification of the function product.",
