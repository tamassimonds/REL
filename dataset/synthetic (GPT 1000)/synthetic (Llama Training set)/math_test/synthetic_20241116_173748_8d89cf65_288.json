    "working_out": "**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, we're looking at the number 1\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}\\,\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}4, where we need to replace the tens and hundreds digit to make the whole number divisible by 11. Divisibility by 11 can be a little tricky, so let's recall what it actually means.\n\nTo check if a number is divisible by 11, you take the alternating sum of its digits (subtract and add them alternatively) and see if the result is divisible by 11. So, given a number with digits \\(a, b, c, d\\), we find if \\((a - b + c - d)\\) is divisible by 11.\n\n**Let's consider how that works here.**\n\nFor our case, we have a number 1\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}\\,\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}4, which translates to \\(1\\), \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(4\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are digits we want to find. According to the rule:\n- The alternating sum becomes \\(1 - x + y - 4 = -3 - x + y\\).\n\n**Setting up the Condition:**\n\n1. The expression \\(-3 - x + y\\) should be a multiple of 11.\n2. This simplifies to \\(y - x = 11k + 3\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n\n**Checking for Validity:**\n\n- Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are digits, their values are constrained between 0 and 9.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate some potential values:\n\n1. Assume \\(k = 0\\):\n   - \\(y - x = 3\\)\n   - \\(x, y\\) pairs: \\((0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 7), (5, 8), (6, 9)\\)\n\n2. Assume \\(k = 1\\):\n   - \\(y - x = 14\\), which is not possible as digits can only range from 0 to 9.\n  \n**Back to Reflection:**\n\nHmm, looking at the first scenario where \\(k=0\\), we had valid pairs. Seems like the values work out here as most feasible because moving to \\(k\\) greater than or less than 0, quickly gets us out of the valid range for digit substitutions.\n\n**Double-checking and Conclusion:**\n\n- We correctly reduced the divisibility by 11 condition to a simple equation for digit pairs.\n- The set of valid combinations for \\(x, y\\) based on the above checks are: \\((0, 3)\\), \\((1, 4)\\), \\((2, 5)\\), \\((3, 6)\\), \\((4, 7)\\), \\((5, 8)\\), and \\((6, 9)\\).\n\nThus, there are **7 ways** to fill in the tens and hundreds digits to make the number divisible by 11.\n\nThis looks right based on both our exploration and rechecks. Overall, we combined logic and divisibility rules directly linked to characteristics of the numbers to solve this.\n\nAhh, I see I've overlooked something in my initial approach. Let's take another look and correct the solution.\n\n**Re-examining the Problem:**\n\nWe are given the number \\(1\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}\\,\\underline{\\hphantom{2}}4\\) and need to fill in the tens digit \\(x\\) and hundreds digit \\(y\\) such that the resulting number is divisible by 11. According to the divisibility rule for 11, the alternating sum of its digits must be divisible by 11. Our number can be represented as \\(1xy4\\), making the alternating sum \\(1 - x + y - 4\\).\n\n**Let's set this up again:**\n\nThe equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ -3 - x + y \\]\n\nWe want this expression to be a multiple of 11. Let's explore the possibilities:\n\n1. **Possibility 1: \\( -3 - x + y = 0 \\)**\n   - This gives us \\( y - x = 3 \\).\n   - For \\( y - x = 3 \\), the potential pairs are \\( (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 7), (5, 8), (6, 9) \\).\n   - This gives us 7 valid combinations.\n\n2. **Possibility 2: \\( -3 - x + y = -11 \\)**\n   - This implies \\( y - x = -8 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( y - x = -8 \\) isn't feasible with digit constraints (since \\( y \\) and \\( x \\) are digits between 0 and 9), but let's check if any valid values exist:\n     - If \\( y = 0 \\), \\( x = 8 \\) (Valid)\n     - If \\( y = 1 \\), \\( x = 9 \\) (Valid)\n   - This gives us 2 valid combinations: \\((8, 0), (9, 1)\\).\n\n3. **Possibility 3: \\( -3 - x + y = 11 \\)**\n   - This means \\( y - x = 14 \\).\n   - Checking the range of digits 0-9, it's impossible for \\( y - x = 14\\) because digits can't reach 14.\n\n**Combining Results:**\n\nFrom possibility 1, we have 7 combinations, and from possibility 2, we have 2 combinations. The third possibility doesn't give us any valid combinations due to digit constraints.\n\nThus, there are a total of \\(7 + 2 = 9\\) ways to fill the digits such that the number is divisible by 11. After rechecking and validating with the cases, I can confirm that the total number of combinations is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "For integer $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ must be divisible by $11$. The only possibilities for $a-b+c-d$ are $-11$, $0$, and $11$.\nPossibility 1: $1-b+c-4=-11 \\implies c-b=-8$. This gives us two possible values: $c=0, b=8$, and $c=1, b=9$.\nPossibility 2: $1-b+c-4=0 \\implies c-b=3$. This gives us $7$ possible values, where $c$ is any integer from $3$ to $9$, and $b=c-3$.\nPossibility 3: $1-b+c-4=11 \\implies c-b=14$. This is impossible since the digit $c$ cannot be greater than $14$,  Thus there are a total of $2+7=\\boxed{9}$ possible values."
