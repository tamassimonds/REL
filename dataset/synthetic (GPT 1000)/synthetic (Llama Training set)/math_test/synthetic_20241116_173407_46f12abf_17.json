I'll share all my thoughts, potential strategies, and insights as we go along.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's make sure I really understand what's being asked. \n\n- We are given that \\(\\det \\mathbf{A} = -1\\), and we're asked to find \\(\\det (\\mathbf{7A})\\).\n- This looks like a problem dealing with determinants, which brings to mind some properties of determinants.\n\n### Properties of Determinants\n\nDeterminants have several properties that might be relevant here. Let's list a few:\n\n1. **Scalar Multiplication**: If a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is multiplied by a scalar \\(c\\), the determinant of the resulting matrix is \\(c^n \\times \\det(\\mathbf{A})\\), where \\(n\\) is the order of the square matrix. This property seems very relevant because we are multiplying the matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) by 7.\n\n2. **Product of Matrices**: If \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is another matrix of the same size as \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), then \\(\\det(\\mathbf{AB}) = \\det(\\mathbf{A}) \\times \\det(\\mathbf{B})\\). Though this deals with matrix products, not directly scalar multiplication.\n\n3. **Identity Matrix**: The determinant of the identity matrix \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is 1, but this doesn't appear directly helpful in this situation.\n\n### Brainstorming and Strategy\n\nFrom these properties, property 1 seems directly applicable. I'm thinking that:\n\n- Since \\(\\mathbf{7A}\\) is essentially multiplying each entry of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) by 7, I might apply this scalar multiplication concept.\n\nHere's how the thought process is forming: \n\n- Let's say \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix. \n- Then, applying the scalar multiplication property, \\(\\det(\\mathbf{7A}) = 7^n \\cdot \\det(\\mathbf{A})\\).\n\n### Check the Approach\n\n- **Matrix Order**: I haven't been given the order of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). But since I'm applying a determinant property that involves \\(n\\), knowing the order is crucial. \n- My assumption right now is that this question assumes familiarity with the determinant properties and implies I should leave the answer in terms of \\(n\\).\n\n### Calculation and Result\n\nAssuming the matrix is \\(n \\times n\\) and using property 1:\n- \\(\\det(\\mathbf{7A}) = 7^n \\times \\det(\\mathbf{A})\\)\n- Since \\(\\det(\\mathbf{A}) = -1\\), we get:\n  \\[\n  \\det(\\mathbf{7A}) = 7^n \\times (-1) = -7^n\n  \\]\n\n### Final Thoughts and Reflection\n\n- **Checking the Result**: The calculation seems consistent with the properties of determinants. If \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) were a simple \\(1 \\times 1\\) matrix (which is not the case here), this would directly match the outcome as well.\n\n- **Does it Align with the Question?**: Yes, it aligns with applying a known property of determinants. \n\n- **Reflection**: I feel confident in this result because it directly uses the properties I brainstormed at the start. Unless there's additional information like the specific order of the matrix, which would give a specific numerical result, the derived expression \\(-7^n\\) appears to be the correct solution for \\(\\det(\\mathbf{7A})\\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's revisit the problem and ensure that we analyze it correctly. The key is to understand the role of the matrix order \\( n \\) in determining the result.\n\n### Revisiting the Problem and Properties\n\nInitially, I considered the properties of determinants, focusing on scalar multiplication. However, let's re-evaluate:\n\n- \\(\\det(\\mathbf{A}) = -1\\), the matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is \\( n \\times n \\).\n- We need \\(\\det(\\mathbf{7A})\\).\n\nI applied the property for scalar multiplication of determinants, but let's re-assess:\n\n### Re-brainstorming\n\n1. **Scalar Multiplication of Matrices**: \n   - If each element of the matrix is multiplied by a scalar \\( k \\), the determinant of the matrix becomes \\( k^n \\times \\det(\\mathbf{A}) \\).\n   - This is very relevant since we're dealing with \\( \\mathbf{7A} \\).\n\n2. **Order of the Matrix**:\n   - Initially, I left the answer in terms of \\( n \\), but let's apply the property to a specific order.\n\n### Re-evaluating with a New Assumption\n\nNow, suppose the problem implicitly considers a common matrix size. Typically, problems like these involve a square matrix, commonly \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) for simplicity in educational contexts.\n\n- Let's assume \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) matrix to check for specific results.\n\n   \\[\n   \\det(\\mathbf{7A}) = 7^2 \\times \\det(\\mathbf{A})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\det(\\mathbf{7A}) = 7^2 \\times (-1) = 49 \\times (-1) = -49\n   \\]\n\n### Reflection and Validation\n\n- **Reviewing the New Calculation**: By assuming a standard matrix size of \\( 2 \\times 2 \\), the computation aligns well with typical problems of this format.\n- **Checking with Other Sizes**: If the matrix were \\( 1 \\times 1 \\), my initial approach would hold for a straightforward scalar, but for higher orders like \\( 3 \\times 3 \\), the altered calculation \\( 7^3 \\times \\det(\\mathbf{A}) \\) confirms the order significance.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nGiven the context and typical assumptions in problems like this, my final answer for a likely \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) matrix leads to \\(\\det(\\mathbf{7A}) = -49\\). This reflects correctly on using the determinant property for scalar multiplication assuming the standard educational context of a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) matrix.",
