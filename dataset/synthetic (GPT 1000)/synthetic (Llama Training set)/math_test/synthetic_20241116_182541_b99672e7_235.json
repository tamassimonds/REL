    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We've got a triangular pyramid, often called a tetrahedron, and we need to find its volume. The question gives us the sides of the base as 3, 4, and 5 feet, and the altitude of the pyramid as 6 feet. Let's break this down step-by-step.\n\n### First Impressions\n- Oh, this sounds like a problem involving both geometry and volume calculation. The base is a triangle, and the dimensions suggest it might be a right triangle because 3, 4, and 5 is a well-known Pythagorean triplet.\n- The altitude of the pyramid is given as 6 feet. This is the perpendicular height from the apex of the pyramid directly to the base.\n\n### Strategy Brainstorm\n1. **Calculate the Area of the Base**: Since the base is a triangle, if it\u2019s a right triangle, calculating the area should be straightforward.\n2. **Use the Volume Formula for Pyramids**: The volume \\( V \\) of any pyramid is given by \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height}\\).\n3. **Verify if the Triangle is Right**: Ensuring it is a right triangle will validate using the straightforward area calculation, i.e., \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\\) of the triangle.\n\n### Calculating the Base Area\n1. Check if 3-4-5 is a right triangle:\n   - Ok, quick check: \\(3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2\\). Yes, it\u2019s a right triangle.\n  \n2. Calculate the area: Use the formula for the area of a right triangle:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 4 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 = 6 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n   - Alright, that looks simple enough. 6 square feet for the area of the base seems reasonable.\n\n### Calculating the Volume\n1. Use the volume formula for pyramids: \n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Altitude}\n   \\]\n2. Substitute the values:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 \\times 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 36 = 12 \\text{ cubic feet}\n   \\]\n\n### Verification\n- Hmm, this feels right based on the problem's straightforward numbers and typical test scenarios.\n- Let me reflect: The logic checks out \u2013 we identified the right triangle, calculated base area correctly, and applied the pyramid volume formula accurately.\n\n### Final Thought\nI feel confident that the solution is correct and the calculations are accurate. The volume of the pyramid is indeed **12 cubic feet**.",

  "ground_truth": "Because we have $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$, the base of the pyramid is a right triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 4.  Therefore, the area of the base is $3\\cdot 4/2 = 6$ square feet.  The altitude of the pyramid is 6 feet.  The volume of the pyramid is one-third the product of the area of the base and the altitude, which is $6\\cdot 6/3=\\boxed{12}$ cubic feet."
