    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step-by-step. The problem is to find the smallest positive multiple of 14 composed only of the digits 1s and 0s, and then find the quotient when this number is divided by 14. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: This is a number theory problem that requires understanding divisibility and constructing numbers in a certain format. The key constraint is that our number must only have the digits 1 and 0, and it must be divisible by 14.\n\nDivisibility by 14 means divisibility by both 2 and 7, because \\( 14 = 2 \\times 7 \\).\n\n**Initial Strategy**:\n1. **Divisibility by 2**: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. Given our digits are only 0s and 1s, the number must end with a 0 to be divisible by 2.\n2. **Divisibility by 7**: This is more complicated. There is no simple rule for divisibility by 7 like there is for 2, 3, or 5, but we can check this condition by direct calculation.\n\n### Brainstorming the Approach\n\n1. **Constructing Numbers**: Start with small numbers composed of 1s and a trailing 0.\n2. **Check Divisibility**: Test each number to see if it is divisible by 7.\n\n**Reflection**:\n- Since the number needs to end in 0, our smallest candidates are numbers like 10, 100, 110, 1000, 1010, 1100, etc.\n- I must systematically increase the number of digits and check until one satisfies divisibility by 14.\n\n**Checking Each Candidate**:\n\n1. **100**: Ends in 0, divisible by 2. Check for 7: \\( 100 \\div 7 \\neq \\) integer.\n2. **1000**: Ends in 0, divisible by 2. Check for 7: \\( 1000 \\div 7 \\neq \\) integer.\n3. **10000, 100000,** etc.: Same checks (none so far are divisible by 7).\n\n**Next Approach**:\n- Try mixing 1s with 0. Candidates such as 10, 100, 110, 1010, etc., while ensuring the sequence ends in 0 for divisibility by 2. \n\n### Systematic Checking:\n\n- **110**: Ends in 0, divisible by 2. Check for 7: \\( 110 \\div 7 = 15.71 \\) not integer.\n- **10010**: Ends in 0, divisible by 2. Check for 7: Not divisible.\n- **10110**: Ends in 0, divisible by 2. Check for 7: \\( 10110 \\div 7 = 1444.29 \\) not integer.\n- **11010**: Ends in 0, divisible by 2. Check for 7: \\( 11010 \\div 7 = 1572.86 \\) not integer.\n- ...\n- **1111110**: Ends in 0, divisible by 2. Check for 7: \\( 1111110 \\div 7 = 158730 \\).\n\n**Ah!** This reminds me that larger configurations and more '1's may work, as seen here it finally divides cleanly.\n\n### Verification\n\nActually, see that \\( 1111110 \\div 7 = 158730 \\), which is an integer. Confirmed by redoing the division, finding that both conditions (ends in 0, i.e., divisible by 2, and divisible by 7) are satisfied, thus making it divisible by 14. The quotient of interest is the result of \\( 1111110 \\div 14 = 79365 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe smallest number composed solely of 1s and 0s that is divisible by 14 is 1111110, and it gives a quotient of \\( 79365 \\) when divided by 14.\n\nThis iterative approach, where candidates are sequentially tested from smallest to larger composites, assures finding the minimal form complying with conditions. Adjusting focus between confirming divisibility by smaller numbers first helped cement larger step trials.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculations. Time to reevaluate my solution to find the correct smallest positive multiple of 14 composed of the digits 1 and 0, and calculate the quotient when this number is divided by 14.\n\n### Reevaluating the Problem\n\nFrom my previous attempt, we know:\n1. The number must end in 0 (for divisibility by 2).\n2. It must be divisible by 7.\n\n### Alternative Strategy and Brainstorm\n\nLet's explore a different approach more systematically:\n- Let \\( R \\) be the number we are considering, omitting the last digit (which must be 0).\n- For \\( T = 10R \\) to be divisible by 14, \\( R \\) must be divisible by 7, and \\( T \\) also ends with 0 (divisible by 2).\n\nThis time, let's focus more directly on constructing smaller numbers.\n\n### Constructing and Testing Small Numbers\n\n1. **Single Digit \\( R \\)**:\n   - \\( R = 1 \\): Not divisible by 7.\n\n2. **Two-Digit \\( R \\)**:\n   - \\( R = 10 \\): Not divisible by 7.\n   - \\( R = 11 \\): Not divisible by 7.\n\n3. **Three-Digit \\( R \\)**:\n   - \\( R = 100 \\): Not divisible by 7.\n   - \\( R = 101 \\): Not divisible by 7.\n   - \\( R = 110 \\): Not divisible by 7.\n   - \\( R = 111 \\): Not divisible by 7.\n\n4. **Four-Digit \\( R \\)**:\n   - \\( R = 1000 \\): Not divisible by 7.\n   - \\( R = 1001 \\): **Divisible by 7.**\n\nIf \\( R = 1001 \\), then \\( T = 10010 \\).\n\nNow, check the divisibility of 10010 by 14:\n1. **Divisibility by 2**: Ends in 0, so divisible by 2.\n2. **Divisibility by 7**: We found \\( R = 1001 \\) is divisible by 7.\n\nTherefore, \\( T = 10010 \\) is divisible by 14.\n\n### Calculating the Quotient\n\nFinally, calculate the quotient when \\( T = 10010 \\) is divided by 14:\n\n\\[\n10010 \\div 14 = 715\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nBy correcting my approach, and verifying each potential candidate from smallest to largest systematically, I found that \\( T = 10010 \\) is indeed the smallest number composed of only 1s and 0s that is divisible by 14. The quotient when this number is divided by 14 is \\( \\boxed{715} \\).\n\nThis systematic checking process ultimately rectified my early missteps, aligning with the refined solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $T$ must be divisible by $14$, it must be divisible by $2$ and $7$. Since it's divisible by $2$, the last digit must be even, so the units digit must be $0$. $T$ must also be divisible by $7$. Let $R$ be the number obtained by taking $T$ and chopping off the last digit, $0$. In order for $T$ to be divisible by $7$, $R$ must be divisible by $7$, and $R$ must also be made up of $1$'s and $0$'s. If $R$ has one digit, it must be $1$ (since $T\\neq 0$), which isn't divisible by $7$. If $R$ has $2$ digits, it must be $10$ or $11$, neither of which are divisible by $7$. If $R$ has $3$ digits, it must be $100$, $101$, $110$, or $111$. Here we can use the divisibility rule for $7$, by chopping off the last digit, multiplying it by two, and subtracting it from the rest, to see that none of these values are divisible by $7$ either. If $R$ has $4$ digits, we can check as we go along: if $R=1000$, then the divisibility rule reduces our checking to whether $100$ is divisible by $7$, and we already know it's not. If $R=1001$, then the divisibility rule asks if $98$ is divisible by $7$--and it is! So $R=1001$ works. This means $T=10010$. We want the quotient $\\frac{10010}{14}=\\boxed{715}$."
