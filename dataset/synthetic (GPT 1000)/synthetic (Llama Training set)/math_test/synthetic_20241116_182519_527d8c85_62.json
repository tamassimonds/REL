    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this step by step. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: \n\n- We have a group of 8 people: 4 guys and 4 girls.\n- We need to choose 3 positions - President, Vice-President, and Treasurer.\n- The condition is that at least one of these positions must be held by a guy and at least one by a girl.\n\nThis looks like a permutations/combinations problem, but with a constraint, which makes it a bit more involved. Typically, when I see conditions like \"at least one,\" I wonder if there's a complementary counting approach that might simplify things.\n\nHmm, let's start by calculating the total number of possibilities first, without considering the gender constraint, and see where that leads us.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Arrangements Without Constraints\n\nThought: How many total ways can we choose 3 specified roles from 8 people without any gender restriction?\n\nWe have 8 people and need to pick 3 different positions for them. Since order matters (President, Vice-President, Treasurer), we'll permute:\n\n\\[ \n8 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 336 \n\\]\n\nOkay, so there are 336 total combinations if we don't care about any gender limitations.\n\n### Step 3: Consider Complementary Counting Strategy\n\nInsight: The constraint \"at least one girl and at least one guy\" suggests that it might be easier to count the scenarios where this condition is violated, and then subtract from the total.\n\nThere are two scenarios where the condition is violated:\n\n1. All three positions are held by guys.\n2. All three positions are held by girls.\n\nLet's count these scenarios individually.\n\n#### Scenario 1: All Three Positions Filled by Guys\n\nThought process: If all positions are filled by guys, I'm picking all 3 positions from the 4 guys without involving any girls:\n\n\\[ \n4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24 \n\\]\n\n#### Scenario 2: All Three Positions Filled by Girls\n\nSimilarly, if all positions are filled by girls, I'm picking all 3 positions from the 4 girls:\n\n\\[ \n4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24 \n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Valid Arrangements\n\nNow, let's subtract the invalid scenarios from our total:\n\nTotal arrangements with no gender restriction = 336\n\nMinus all guys scenario = 24\n\nMinus all girls scenario = 24\n\nSo, valid arrangements = 336 - 24 - 24 = 288\n\n### Step 5: Review and Reflect\n\nLet me just check if this makes sense. We definitely wanted to exclude both scenarios where there was no gender balance (all guys or all girls), and the subtraction method feels correct here.\n\nThe overall approach was to use complementary counting, which often simplifies these constraints problems. I re-calculated those permutations a couple of times to ensure accuracy, and they seem correct.\n\nAfter a thorough check, I\u2019m confident that the number of ways to choose a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer such that at least one guy and at least one girl is included is **288**.",

  "ground_truth": "We have $8$ choices for president, $7$ choices for vice-president, and $6$ choices for treasurer, for a total of $8\\times7\\times6 = 336$ choices. Now we have to subtract the number of choices that don't satisfy the requirement, where the $3$ officers are all boys or all girls. For either case, we have $4$ choices for president, $3$ choices of vice-president, and $2$ choices for treasurer, a total of $4\\times3\\times2 = 24$ choices. So we have $2\\times 24 = 48$ total choices that don't satisfy the requirement.\n\nThus, there are $336-48=\\boxed{288}$ good choices."
