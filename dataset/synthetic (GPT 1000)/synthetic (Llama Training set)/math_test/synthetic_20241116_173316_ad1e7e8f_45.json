    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nFirst, the problem is asking us to convert fallops to wallops using the given conversion factors between wallops, ballops, and fallops. My initial thought is, \"This looks like a unit conversion problem,\" which is similar to converting units like miles to kilometers using given ratios.\n\n**Brainstorming How to Approach:**\n\n1. **Identify Given Relationships:** \n\n   - 6 wallops = 5 ballops\n   - 3 ballops = 11 fallops\n\n2. **Determine the Target:** \n\n   - We need to express 110 fallops in terms of wallops.\n\nInitially, I'm thinking about converting fallops to ballops first, then ballops to wallops since we have direct ratios for those conversions.\n\n**Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**\n\n**Step 1: Convert Fallops to Ballops**\n\nWe know that 3 ballops = 11 fallops. I want to find out how many ballops are equivalent to 110 fallops.\n\n- **Set up the proportion:** \n  \\[\n  \\frac{3 \\text{ ballops}}{11 \\text{ fallops}} = \\frac{x \\text{ ballops}}{110 \\text{ fallops}}\n  \\]\n\n- **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n\n  By cross-multiplying, we get:\n  \\[\n  11x = 3 \\times 110\n  \\]\n\n  Calculating the right side:\n  \\[\n  11x = 330\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{330}{11} = 30\n  \\]\n\nSo, 110 fallops is equivalent to 30 ballops.\n\n**Reflect:** These calculations seem correct. The numbers appear reasonable and align with the provided ratios.\n\n**Step 2: Convert Ballops to Wallops**\n\nNow we need to convert 30 ballops to wallops using the ratio 6 wallops = 5 ballops.\n\n- **Set up the proportion:** \n  \\[\n  \\frac{6 \\text{ wallops}}{5 \\text{ ballops}} = \\frac{y \\text{ wallops}}{30 \\text{ ballops}}\n  \\]\n\n- **Solve for \\(y\\):**\n\n  By cross-multiplying, we get:\n  \\[\n  5y = 6 \\times 30\n  \\]\n\n  Calculating the right side:\n  \\[\n  5y = 180\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{180}{5} = 36\n  \\]\n\nSo, 30 ballops are equivalent to 36 wallops.\n\n**Check and Reflect:** Let's quickly review:\n\n1. From fallops to ballops: 110 fallops = 30 ballops.\n2. From ballops to wallops: 30 ballops = 36 wallops.\n\nThe solution path seemed logical, leveraging proportions correctly, and the final numbers check out. \n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, 110 fallops are equivalent to 36 wallops.",

  "ground_truth": "Multiply  \\[\n3\\text{ ballops}=11\\text{ fallops}\n\\] by 10 to find that $30$ ballops are equal to $110$ fallops.  Then multiply  \\[\n6\\text{ wallops} = 5\\text{ ballops}\n\\] by 6 to find that $\\boxed{36}$ wallops are equivalent to 30 ballops."
