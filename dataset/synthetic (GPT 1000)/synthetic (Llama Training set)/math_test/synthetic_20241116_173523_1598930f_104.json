    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with a step-by-step approach, letting my thoughts flow naturally as I brainstorm, analyze, and reflect throughout the process.\n\n### First Impressions & Initial Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see this problem, \"T is the smallest positive multiple of 14 whose digits are all 1s and 0s,\" I\u2019m thinking a few things:\n\n- **Challenge**: Numbers with only 1s and 0s remind me of binary numbers, although we aren't necessarily in base 2. Also, we need divisibility by 14, which is not just random; it's a product of 2 and 7.\n- **Starting Strategy**: Perhaps we check small numbers containing only 1s and 0s that could potentially be divisible by 14.\n- **Expectation**: It could mean going through several numbers before finding the smallest, but let's think smart rather than brute force through every number.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategy\n\n1. **Divisibility by 14**: We need to remember that a number is divisible by 14 if it\u2019s divisible by both 2 and 7.\n2. **Characteristics of Digits**: The number composed solely of 1s and 0s implies that it must end with 0 (for divisibility by 2).\n\nI\u2019ll begin by constructing small numbers formed by 1s and 0s and test if they are divisible by 14.\n\n### Initial Trial and Error\n\n1. **Small Numbers with 1s and 0s**:\n   - Try 10: Not applicable (Divisible by 2 but not by 7).\n   - Try 100: Also fails (Divisible by 2 but not 7).\n\n2. **Let's increase the complexity a bit while still keeping simplicity in mind**:\n   - Test 110, 1000, 1001...\n\n   Okay, let\u2019s focus. Since we've established the number must end in 0, let's try to form more complex alternating patterns with a suitable length and pattern.\n\n### Revisiting Strategy\n\n1. **Checking further multiples in sequence**:\n   - I realize suddenly, \"The alternating or single-digit approach might not be ideal. What if it's something that also follows a certain repetitive structure?\"\n\n2. **Building systematically**:\n   - Let's really ramp up how thoroughly we're constructing it without jumping several numbers\u2014align our choices with basic divisibility first.\n\n### Deep Searching & The Aha Moment\n\nLet's list some basics:\n- T must be a multiple of 14.\n- T must end in 0 for divisibility by 2.\n- We now check sequences like: 10, 100, 1000... see any patterns.\n\nOnce rigorous trials on these didn't work for 7\u2019s test, say to myself: \"Okay, it's time for a little repetition and value checks. What's simpler is not always the quickest when faced with encapsulated logical checks.\"\n\nHere I test multiples and come across:\n- 70: Multiplies by 10 equals 700\n- 140\n- 10010 (ends with zero still isn\u2019t 7 divisible)\n- Align observed factors now to check bigger scales.\n- Trial finding: **210** - realization clicks! Air punching: bingo! \n\nThe smallest number formed only of 1s and 0s divisible by both conditions turns out to be 210. Verifying approach via:\n- 210 / 14 = 15 \u2705 (Verification succeeds!)\n\n### Conclusion & Verification\n\nReflectively:\n- Verified divisibility: Correct through manual scales and divisibility tests.\n- Step reflection: Best realized the process called for pattern-hunting with logical constructs (simplifying towards bigger multiples, realizing approach-drive counts torwards checks).\n  \nFinally, I confidently state the final outcome:\n- The number \"210\" satisfies, with the quotient when T = 210 is divided by 14 being **15**. \n- Happy realization, gets the anticipation it needs, neat and tidy!\n\nThis step-by-step approach has not only honed my problem-solving strategy but helped ensure the accurate solution: quotient by 14: **15**.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous response. Let's take a fresh look at this problem, going through my thought process to understand where I went wrong and find the correct solution.\n\n### Reflection & Reanalysis\n\nFirst, let's revisit the problem: We need the smallest positive multiple of 14 whose digits are all 1s and 0s. Initially, my approach was to find numbers that fit these criteria without thoroughly checking all necessary divisibility conditions. Let's refine the strategy now.\n\n### Brainstorming & Adjusted Strategy\n\n1. **Divisibility by 14**: As mentioned before, this requires divisibility by both 2 and 7.\n    - **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end with a 0.\n    - **Divisibility by 7**: This typically requires a bit more thought. I'll explore smaller numbers that meet these criteria and apply the divisibility rule for 7.\n\n2. **Systematic Exploration**:\n    - Since the number must end in 0, consider \\( T = R0 \\) where \\( R \\) is composed only of 1s and 0s.\n    - My previous trials with smaller numbers like 10 and 100 revealed pitfalls, so I'll need a more systematic method for checking divisibility by 7.\n\n### Verification & Correction\n\n- **Reconsider smaller numbers**: I\u2019ll start checking systematically with increasing patterns.\n- **Check divisibility**:\n  - For \\( R = 1 \\), \\( T = 10 \\) (fails for divisibility by 7).\n  - For \\( R = 10 \\), \\( T = 100 \\) (fails for divisibility by 7).\n  - Continue with \\( R = 100, 101, 110, 111 \\).\n\nLet's apply the divisibility rule for 7 systematically:\n\n- For \\( R = 1001 \\), with \\( T = 10010 \\), check divisibility:\n  - Remove last digit (0), the number is 1001.\n  - According to the divisibility rule for 7: Chop off the last digit, multiply by 2, and subtract from the rest.\n  - Calculate: \\( 100 - 2 \\times 1 = 98 \\). Is 98 divisible by 7? Yes, \\( 98 \\div 7 = 14 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter applying this logic and checking over my approach, I find that \\( T = 10010 \\) indeed satisfies all criteria. Therefore, when \\( T \\) is divided by 14, the quotient is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{10010}{14} = 715 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is: **715**. Doing these checks helps ensure that all conditions are met and confirms the problem's constraints are respected, ultimately leading to the right solution.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous response.

  "ground_truth": "Since $T$ must be divisible by $14$, it must be divisible by $2$ and $7$. Since it's divisible by $2$, the last digit must be even, so the units digit must be $0$. $T$ must also be divisible by $7$. Let $R$ be the number obtained by taking $T$ and chopping off the last digit, $0$. In order for $T$ to be divisible by $7$, $R$ must be divisible by $7$, and $R$ must also be made up of $1$'s and $0$'s. If $R$ has one digit, it must be $1$ (since $T\\neq 0$), which isn't divisible by $7$. If $R$ has $2$ digits, it must be $10$ or $11$, neither of which are divisible by $7$. If $R$ has $3$ digits, it must be $100$, $101$, $110$, or $111$. Here we can use the divisibility rule for $7$, by chopping off the last digit, multiplying it by two, and subtracting it from the rest, to see that none of these values are divisible by $7$ either. If $R$ has $4$ digits, we can check as we go along: if $R=1000$, then the divisibility rule reduces our checking to whether $100$ is divisible by $7$, and we already know it's not. If $R=1001$, then the divisibility rule asks if $98$ is divisible by $7$--and it is! So $R=1001$ works. This means $T=10010$. We want the quotient $\\frac{10010}{14}=\\boxed{715}$."
