    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem of finding the vertex of the parabola given by the equation \\(y = 2x^2 - 4x + 4\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nWhen I first see this, it reminds me that the vertex of a parabola \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) can be found using a formula. But before diving to that, let\u2019s explore a couple of strategies here. I know that typically we could:\n1. Convert the equation to vertex form.\n2. Use the vertex formula \\((h, k)\\) derived from standard form.\n\nLet me think a bit more about both options and then decide which might be simpler for this problem.\n\n### Strategy Exploration\n1. **Convert to Vertex Form:** This would involve completing the square. I could manipulate the equation so that it looks like \\(y = a(x-h)^2 + k\\). This way, \\((h, k)\\) is immediately visible as the vertex.\n\n2. **Use Vertex Formula:** There's a straightforward formula for finding the x-coordinate of the vertex, \\(x = -\\frac{b}{2a}\\), for the standard quadratic form \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\).\n\nOkay, both methods are viable, but thinking practically, the vertex formula seems like it might get the job done efficiently here without too much algebraic manipulation.\n\n### Using the Vertex Formula\n1. **Identify coefficients:** Notice that our equation is \\(y = 2x^2 - 4x + 4\\), identify \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = -4\\), and \\(c = 4\\).\n2. **Apply the formula:** For the vertex \\(x = -\\frac{b}{2a}\\):\n   \\[\n   x = -\\frac{-4}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1\n   \\]\n\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex, \\(m\\), is 1.\n\n### Verification through Calculation\nLet me verify by plugging \\(x = 1\\) back into the original quadratic formula to ensure consistency:\n\n1. **Substitute \\(x = 1\\) back into \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\):**\n   \\[\n   y = 2(1)^2 - 4(1) + 4 = 2 - 4 + 4 = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Check against graphical understanding:** The calculation checks out, as at \\(x = 1\\), the equation yields \\(y = 2\\). This confirms that the vertex will indeed be at \\(x = 1\\) in terms of symmetry.\n\n3. **Reflection:** Thinking about typical quadratic behavior, being the value for \\(x\\) minimizes/maximizes the parabola, the signs, and calculations all seem coherent.\n\n### Final Answer\nFinally, my calculation and verification steps checked out, so the correct value of \\(m\\), the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola, is indeed \\(m = 1\\).\n\nThat should do it \u2013 the method using the vertex formula was efficient and correct in this context.",

  "ground_truth": "We will complete the square on the given quadratic expression to find the vertex. Factoring 2 from the first two terms, we have \\[y=2(x^2-2x)+4\\]We complete the square inside the parentheses by adding $+1-1$ inside the parentheses to get \\[y = 2(x^2-2x+1-1)+4 =2(x-1)^2+2\\]The graph of an equation of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabola with vertex at $(h,k)$, so the vertex of our parabola is at $(1,2)$. Thus, $m=\\boxed{1}$."
