    "working_out": "Alright, let's break this down. The problem asks us to find how many factorials from \\(1!\\) to \\(100!\\) are divisible by 9.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nFirst off, when I see the term \"factorial,\" I immediately think about large numbers. Factorials grow very quickly \u2014 \\(n!\\) is the product of all positive integers up to \\(n\\), which means even \\(10!\\) is a sizable number. The question is about divisibility by 9, which triggers a memory from number theory: a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. However, given the exponential growth of factorials, calculating their digits is not practical here.\n\n### Step-by-Step Brainstorming\n\n1. **Understanding 9's Prime Factorization**: \n   - 9 is \\(3^2\\). So, a number needs at least two 3s in its prime factorization to be divisible by 9.\n\n2. **Approach Exploration**: \n   - *Counting 3s in Factorials*: This prompts me to think about counting factors of 3 in these factorial numbers. \\(n!\\) will have more than enough 3s in its factorization once \\(n\\) is large enough.\n   - *Is there a threshold?* I suspect there'll be a point where all factorials beyond a certain point are guaranteed to have enough factors of 3.\n\n3. **Calculating Necessary 3s**:\n  - I remember a technique to count the number of a prime \\(p\\) in \\(n!\\): the formula\n    \\[\n    \\text{Number of 3s in } n! = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{9} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{27} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n    \\]\n   - We need this sum to be at least 2 (since that's how many 3's are needed for a number to be divisible by \\(3^2 = 9\\)).\n\n### Calculations\n\n1. **Applying the Formula**:\n   - For \\(1!\\), \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\) (so not divisible by 9).\n   - For \\(2!\\), \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\) (so not divisible by 9).\n   - For \\(3!\\), \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{3}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\) (so not divisible by 9).\n   - For \\(4!\\), \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{4}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\) (so not divisible by 9).\n\nCheck calculations at stages - If a direction feels off, it is worth adjusting before going further. \n  \n2. **Finding the Threshold**:\n   - For \\(6!\\), \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{6}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 2 \\). This is where it becomes interesting because 6! would indeed satisfy being divisible by \\(3^2\\).\n\n3. **Progressive Check**:\n   - Check at 9!, and 9! has \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{9}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{9}{9} \\right\\rfloor = 3 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - It strikes me that for any \\(n \\geq 6\\), \\(n!\\) will have at least two factors of 3 (i.e., at least enough to be divisible by 9).\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- A realization occurs here: After 6!, each factorial has the needed number of factors of 3.\n- So factorials \\(6!\\) through \\(100!\\) are divisible by 9.\n\n**Final Answer**:\nNumber of factorials from \\(1!\\) to \\(100!\\) divisible by 9 is 95 factorials (from \\(6!\\) to \\(100!\\)).",

  "ground_truth": "To have 9 as a factor, $n!$ must have two factors of 3.  The first such $n$ for which this is true is 6, since  $6! = \\textbf{6} \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times \\textbf{3} \\times 2 \\times 1$.  Since 9 is a factor of $6!$ and $6!$ is a factor of $n!$ for all $n \\ge 6$, the numbers $6!, 7!, 8!, \\ldots, 99!, 100!$ are all divisible by 9.  There are $100 - 6 + 1 = \\boxed{95}$ numbers in that list."
