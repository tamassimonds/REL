    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\nOkay, I need to find Tamara's missing quiz score. She has five quizzes in total, and the arithmetic mean of these is 95%. So, I'm dealing with an average here, and I know the scores of four quizzes, but one's missing. This looks like it's going to involve some basic algebra, combined with understanding what the arithmetic mean means in this context.\n\nBrainstorming:\n\n1. **Mean Calculation Approach:** Since I have the mean of the quiz scores, I can use that information to find the total sum of all five scores. With this total, I can subtract the sum of the four known scores to find the missing one.\n\n2. **Equation Formulation Approach:** I could set up an equation based on the definition of mean, since I'm familiar with that. I can use the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\text{Total sum of scores}}{\\text{Number of scores}}\n   \\]\n\nEither strategy should lead me to the answer. I'll start by calculating the total score using the mean calculation approach.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total of all five quiz scores using the mean:\n\n- The arithmetic mean of the five scores is 95%.\n- This means that the total sum of the scores divided by five equals 95.\n  \n\\[ \n\\frac{\\text{Sum of scores}}{5} = 95 \n\\]\n\nTo find the total sum of the scores, multiply both sides by 5:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of scores} = 95 \\times 5 = 475\n\\]\n\nStep 2: Add up the known scores:\n\n- Known scores: 100%, 100%, 99%, 98%\n- Sum of known scores = \\(100 + 100 + 99 + 98 = 397\\)\n\nStep 3: Find the missing score:\n\n- Total sum of all scores = 475 (from step 1)\n- Sum of known scores = 397 (from step 2)\n\nThe missing score can be found by subtracting the sum of the known scores from the total sum:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Missing score} = 475 - 397 = 78\n\\]\n\nReflecting on the solution:\n\n- Calculations seem straightforward. Double-checked each step to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n- 78 seems like a plausible number, considering the other scores and given that the average is 95%.\n\nFinal Check:\n\n- If the missing score is 78, let's add it back to the known scores and check if the mean works out:\n  \n\\[ \n100 + 100 + 99 + 98 + 78 = 475 \n\\]\n  \n- Divide this total by 5:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{475}{5} = 95\n\\]\n\nYes, it checks out! The approach was correct, and the missing score is 78%.",
