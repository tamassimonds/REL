    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: \\(0.8\\overline{4} - 0.\\overline{4}\\). I'm going to express my thoughts and calculations step-by-step here, as if I'm working through it in real-time.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n- First off, I recognize these as repeating decimals, which I've dealt with before. The repeating part is often a sign that these numbers have clean fractional representations.\n- The challenge here is to convert both \\(0.8\\overline{4}\\) and \\(0.\\overline{4}\\) into fractions and then perform the subtraction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Conversion and Subtraction\n1. **Convert \\(0.\\overline{4}\\) to a Fraction:**\n   - \\(0.\\overline{4}\\) means the digit '4' repeats indefinitely: \\(0.4444...\\).\n   - Let's represent this repeating decimal as \\(x\\).\n   - Equation: \\(x = 0.4444...\\).\n   - To eliminate the repeating part, I'll multiply by 10: \\(10x = 4.4444...\\).\n   - Subtracting these two equations: \n     \\[\n     10x - x = 4.4444... - 0.4444...\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     9x = 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{4}{9}\n     \\]\n   - So, \\(0.\\overline{4} = \\frac{4}{9}\\).\n\n2. **Convert \\(0.8\\overline{4}\\) to a Fraction:**\n   - \\(0.8\\overline{4}\\) means \\(0.84444...\\).\n   - Let\u2019s call this number \\(y\\).\n   - Equation: \\(y = 0.84444...\\).\n   - To tackle the repeating part, let's multiply by 10 first to handle the non-repeating '8': \\(10y = 8.4444...\\).\n   - Now, '4' is repeating. Multiply the equation by 10 again to move one more decimal place: \\(100y = 84.4444...\\).\n   - Below is the subtraction step to clear up the repeating part:\n     \\[\n     100y - 10y = 84.4444... - 8.4444...\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     90y = 76\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{76}{90}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify \\(\\frac{76}{90}\\) by finding the greatest common divisor, which is 2:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{38}{45}\n     \\]\n   - Thus, \\(0.8\\overline{4} = \\frac{38}{45}\\).\n\n3. **Subtract the Fractions:**\n   - We have \\(\\frac{38}{45} - \\frac{4}{9}\\).\n   - Convert \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\) to have a denominator of 45, which is the same as \\(\\frac{38}{45}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4}{9} \\times \\frac{5}{5} = \\frac{20}{45}\n     \\]\n   - Subtract the fractions:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{38}{45} - \\frac{20}{45} = \\frac{18}{45}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify \\(\\frac{18}{45}\\) by the greatest common divisor, which is 9:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{18}{45} = \\frac{2}{5}\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter calculating each part and subtracting, the result of \\(0.8\\overline{4} - 0.\\overline{4}\\) is \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\). \n\nThis looks right after checking through the calculations. Both initial fractions were derived accurately, I've correctly adjusted denominators, and the subtraction lined up as intended. Feeling good about this result!",

  "ground_truth": "Note that $0.8\\overline{4} = 0.8 + 0.0\\overline{4}$ and $0.\\overline{4} = 0.4 + 0.0\\overline{4}.$ Our expression becomes \\begin{align*}\n0.8\\overline{4}-0.\\overline{4} &= (0.8 + 0.0\\overline{4}) - (0.4 + 0.0\\overline{4}) \\\\\n&= 0.8 + 0.0\\overline{4} + (-0.4) + (-0.0\\overline{4}) \\\\\n&= [0.8 + (-0.4)] + [0.0\\overline{4} + (-0.0\\overline{4})] \\\\\n&= 0.4 + 0 = 0.4.\n\\end{align*}The decimal number $0.4$, when expressed as a fraction, is $\\frac{4}{10}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}.$"
