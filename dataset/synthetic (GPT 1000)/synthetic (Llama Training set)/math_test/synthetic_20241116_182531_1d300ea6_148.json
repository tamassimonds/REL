    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The given parametric curve is \\((x, y) = (\\sin t, \\sin 2t)\\). We need to express this curve in the form \\( ax^4 - bx^2 + cy^2 = 0 \\) and find the smallest possible positive integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) such that \\(a + b + c\\) is minimized.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: The problem involves translating a parametric equation into an implicit equation. This resembles a classic technique of eliminating the parameter. Initially, I recall methods for eliminating parameters from trigonometric expressions, particularly those involving \\(\\sin\\) and \\(\\cos\\).\n\n- The curve is defined using \\(\\sin t\\) and \\(\\sin 2t\\).\n- This suggests using trigonometric identities, such as double-angle identities.\n\n### Step 2: Write Identities and Explore\n\nThe double-angle identity tells us \\(\\sin 2t = 2 \\sin t \\cos t\\). Let's see how we can use this:\n\n- \\( x = \\sin t \\)\n- Therefore, \\(\\sin^2 t = x^2\\).\n\nThis suggests trying to express \\(\\cos t\\) in terms of \\(x\\).\n\nUsing the basic identity:\n\n- \\(\\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t = 1\\) implies \\(\\cos^2 t = 1 - \\sin^2 t = 1 - x^2\\).\n\nThis gives us \\(\\cos t = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}\\), but we should be cautious about \\(\\pm\\) signs.\n\n### Step 3: Express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\)\n\nGiven \\( y = \\sin 2t = 2 \\sin t \\cos t \\):\n\n- \\( y = 2x\\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\).\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n- \\( y^2 = (2x\\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 = 4x^2(1 - x^2) = 4x^2 - 4x^4 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Rearrange into the Desired Form\n\nWe need to manipulate this result to fit the form \\( ax^4 - bx^2 + cy^2 = 0 \\):\n\n- Move everything to one side: \\( 4x^4 - 4x^2 + y^2 = 0 \\).\n\nNow, this expression resembles our desired form:\n\n- \\( a = 4 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), \\( c = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 5 & 6: Verify and Minimize \\(a + b + c\\)\n\nNow, sum these values to find \\(a + b + c\\):\n\n- \\( a + b + c = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 \\).\n\nI will pause and conduct a quick check to ensure there are no simpler or more minimal integers:\n\n- Consider potential adjustments: If interpreting \\(y^2 = 4x^2 - 4x^4\\) differently or re-evaluating the equation might reveal smaller values for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), or \\(c\\).\n- Reflecting again, the squared terms and the derived algebra seem optimal without further adjustments since \\(y^2 = 4x^2 - 4x^4\\) fits naturally into the structure \\(ax^4 - bx^2 + cy^2\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe smallest possible value of \\(a + b + c\\) in this context appears to be \\(9\\), based on my derivation and calculations. Given the constraint to use positive integers, \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = 4\\), and \\(c = 1\\) reflect the minimal configuration under this algebraic form.\n\nFinal answer: \\(a + b + c = 9\\).",
