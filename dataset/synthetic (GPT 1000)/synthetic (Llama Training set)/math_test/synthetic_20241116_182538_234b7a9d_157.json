    "working_out": "Alright, let's jump into the problem: \n\n**Problem Statement:** We are asked to find \\(\\sin^3 x + \\cos^3 x\\) given that \\(\\sin x + \\cos x = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n\nWhen I first see this, I think about the identities involving \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\). The equation \\(\\sin x + \\cos x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) is striking me as something that could be transformed or manipulated using known trigonometric identities.\n\nOne identity that comes to mind is the Pythagorean identity: \n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\n\\]\n\nBut right now, we have a sum of the first powers of sine and cosine, not squared. So let me note down the task: convert the first powers of sine and cosine into either squared (or cube powers). From experience, identities that rewrite expressions might help.\n\n### Brainstorming Stratergies:\n\n1. **Power-sum Identity:** I remember a handy expression for cubes:\n\n   \\[\n   a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\n   \\]\n\n   Here \\(a = \\sin x\\) and \\(b = \\cos x\\). If I plug these into the identity, that might get me somewhere in having this sum of cubes become more manageable.\n\n2. **Express in terms of known values:** If I could express \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) in terms of \\(\\sin(2x)\\) or any other expression, that might help. But this seems secondary right now.\n\n3. **Use substitution from trigonometric identities:** Can we perhaps think about transforming the expression involving \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) into something else?\n\nThese form the core of my brainstorming.\n\n### Check and continue with the most promising approach:\n\nThe cube identity is mathematically elegant and handy, so let's try it:\n\n- Since \\(\\sin x + \\cos x = \\frac{1}{2}\\), applying this to the cube identity:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^3 x + \\cos^3 x = (\\sin x + \\cos x)(\\sin^2 x - \\sin x \\cos x + \\cos^2 x)\n\\]\n\n- We know \\(\\sin x + \\cos x = \\frac{1}{2}\\). What about the expression inside the parentheses?\n\n  - \\(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\\) (from the Pythagorean identity)\n  - Trying to compute \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\) is essential because I need it to find the actual values.\n\n### Calculate \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\):\n\nWe consider squaring both sides of the original equation \\(\\sin x + \\cos x = \\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n(\\sin x + \\cos x)^2 = \\sin^2 x + 2\\sin x \\cos x + \\cos^2 x = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nUsing \\(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\\), plug this in:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2\\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\):\n\n\\[\n2\\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{1}{4} - 1 = -\\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sin x \\cos x = -\\frac{3}{8}\n\\]\n\n### Substitute back into cubed identity:\n\nNow that we\u2019ve found \\(\\sin x \\cos x = -\\frac{3}{8}\\), let's substitute back:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^3 x + \\cos^3 x = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (-\\frac{3}{8}))\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\frac{3}{8})\n\\]\n\nCalculate inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{11}{8}\n\\]\n\nComplete the calculation:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{11}{8} = \\frac{11}{16}\n\\]\n\n### Final Reflection:\n\nEvery part of this seems to fit logically. The calculations held up, and the approach of utilizing the sum of cubes worked well with the initial trigonometric condition. Thus, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^3 x + \\cos^3 x = \\frac{11}{16}\n\\]\n\nLooks good; I'm confident this is the correct answer.",
