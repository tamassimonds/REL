  "problem": "A deli sandwich consists of one type of bread, one type of meat, and one type of sauce. The deli offers wheat, rye, and white bread; ham, turkey, roast beef, and tuna; ranch and southwest chipotle sauce. Javier is allergic to rye bread, tuna, and southwest chipotle sauce. He tells the server to assemble a random deli sandwich. What is the probability that Javier will suffer an allergic reaction?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I\u2019ll let my thoughts flow naturally as I work through it, and I'll reflect and adjust my approach along the way.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question\nOkay, so we're dealing with a deli sandwich problem where Javier has allergies to specific ingredients. Initially, it seems like a simple probability problem where we need to calculate the chance of Javier getting an allergic reaction. What I understand is that Javier is allergic to rye bread, tuna, and southwest chipotle sauce. So any sandwich that contains any of these ingredients will trigger an allergic reaction.\n\n### Step 2: List the Options\nLet's break down the options:\n- **Breads**: wheat, rye, white\n- **Meats**: ham, turkey, roast beef, tuna\n- **Sauces**: ranch, southwest chipotle\n\nJavier can't have rye, tuna, or southwest chipotle.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Non-Allergic Choices\nFirst, let's consider what sandwiches won't cause an allergic reaction for Javier. We need to count how many combinations exclude the allergens.\n\n- **Bread**: wheat, white (2 options since rye is out)\n- **Meat**: ham, turkey, roast beef (3 options, excluding tuna)\n- **Sauce**: ranch (1 option since southwest chipotle is not an option)\n\nSo the total number of sandwiches Javier can safely eat is the product of these choices:  \n\\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 6 \\) sandwiches.\n\n### Step 4: Total Number of Sandwich Possibilities\nNow, to find the total possible sandwich combinations without any restrictions:\n- **Bread**: 3 choices (wheat, rye, white)\n- **Meat**: 4 choices (ham, turkey, roast beef, tuna)\n- **Sauce**: 2 choices (ranch, southwest chipotle)\n\nWhich is:  \n\\( 3 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 24 \\) total combinations.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Probability of an Allergic Reaction\nThe probability that Javier will suffer an allergic reaction is the probability of picking a sandwich that contains at least one of his allergens.\n\n**Non-allergic sandwiches**: 6 (from Step 3)  \n**Total sandwiches**: 24 (from Step 4)  \n\nThe probability of not having an allergic reaction is:  \n\\[ \\frac{6}{24} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nSo, the probability of having an allergic reaction is the complement of not having one:  \n\\[ 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\n### Step 6: Quick Verification\nLet's reflect:\nIt makes sense as the restricted options trimmed significantly from the total. Out of the 24 possible sandwiches, 18 contain allergens either from rye, tuna or southwest chipotle sauce. Seems correct given that 18/24 simplifies to 3/4.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the probability that Javier will suffer an allergic reaction is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\nThis looks solid; we've considered all the combinations and allergy restrictions appropriately. If this were a more complex problem, I\u2019d keep iterating over the steps, but the straightforward nature of ingredient exclusions means our method is sound.",

  "ground_truth": "We find the probability that Javier does not suffer an allergic reaction, and subtract from 1. For Javier to not suffer an allergic reaction, the server must choose wheat or white bread; turkey, roast beef, or ham; and ranch sauce. The probability of this occurring is $\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, the probability that Javier suffers an allergic reaction is $1-\\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$."
