    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s tackle this question about expected value step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different approaches and organizing my thoughts as I go.\n\n**Understanding the Question:**\n\nFirstly, I need to clarify the problem statement. We\u2019re flipping a coin where:\n\n- A head wins \\$2.\n- A tail loses \\$1.\n\nThe task is to find the expected value of winning after one flip.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nThis seems like a pretty standard problem about expected value. I\u2019ve worked on similar problems before\u2014it's often important to consider the probability of each outcome along with the associated values. The concept of expected value usually involves weighing possible outcomes by their probabilities.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **List the possible outcomes:**\n\n   - Heads: Win \\$2\n   - Tails: Lose \\$1\n\n2. **Determine the probability of each outcome:**\n\n   Since we're dealing with a fair coin, the probability of getting heads \\(P(H)\\) is \\(0.5\\) and the probability of getting tails \\(P(T)\\) is also \\(0.5\\).\n\n3. **Multiply each outcome by its probability:**\n\n   We want to find the expected value, E, which can be calculated by summing the products of each outcome\u2019s value and its probability.\n\n   - For heads: \\( \\text{value} = 2, \\text{probability} = 0.5 \\)\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 0.5 = 1\n     \\]\n\n   - For tails: \\( \\text{value} = -1, \\text{probability} = 0.5 \\)\n     \\[\n     -1 \\times 0.5 = -0.5\n     \\]\n\n4. **Sum these results:**\n\n   Now, add up the contributions from each outcome to get the total expected value.\n   \\[\n   E = 1 + (-0.5) = 0.5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Check:**\n\n   Let's pause and consider what this means. An expected value of \\$0.5 suggests that, on average, we would win 50 cents per coin flip if we repeated this game many times. This seems reasonable given the setup, where the potential gain is slightly larger than the potential loss.\n\n**Reflecting:**\n\nThroughout this calculation, it looks like we\u2019ve taken the right steps. I considered both outcomes, applied their probabilities correctly, and the result makes sense contextually. The solution aligns with our intuition about balancing the possible gains and losses in a probabilistic scenario.\n\nEverything checks out logically, so I\u2019m confident that the expected value of our winnings after one flip is indeed \\$0.5. This systematic approach helped ensure that I didn\u2019t overlook any details.",

  "ground_truth": "In one flip, we have a $1/2$ chance of getting heads and winning 2 dollars, and a $1/2$ chance of getting tails and losing 1 dollar.  So the expected value of one flip is $E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\$2) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\$1) = \\boxed{\\$0.50}$."
