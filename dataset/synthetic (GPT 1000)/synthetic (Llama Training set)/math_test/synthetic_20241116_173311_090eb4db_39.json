    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n**First Thoughts**\n- Looking at the problem, I need to convert a currency system involving farthings, pence, shillings, and pounds. \n- My goal is to find out how many farthings are equivalent to one pound and an additional five pence. \n- I remember some conversions from history lessons, but a quick check confirms them: 4 farthings in a pence, 12 pence in a shilling, 20 shillings in a pound. \n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n- Okay, so I need to start from the largest unit and convert everything down into farthings, because that's what the final answer requires. \n- Start from the pound: 1 pound needs to be converted into farthings first. \n- Then, the extra 5 pence should be converted to farthings and added to the total from the pound. \n\n**Breaking down the solution:**\n1. **Convert Pound to Shillings**: \n   - I know from the conversions given that 1 pound equals 20 shillings. \n\n2. **Convert Shillings to Pence**: \n   - Then, each shilling is equivalent to 12 pence.\n   - Therefore, 20 shillings is \\(20 \\times 12 = 240\\) pence. \n   - Okay, that seems right. Let's move on.\n\n3. **Convert Pence to Farthings**:\n   - Each pence contains 4 farthings.\n   - So, 240 pence is \\(240 \\times 4 = 960\\) farthings.\n   - That feels right, but let me just briefly check: if a smaller unit conversion seemed off, my final large conversion will be off too. Quick calculation again\u2014yep, 960.\n\n4. **Add the Additional 5 Pence**:\n   - Now, I need to add the 5 additional pence initially mentioned.\n   - 5 pence is \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) farthings.\n   - Quick reflection: 5 times 4 is straightforward, 20 should make sense as 5 sets of pennies.\n\n5. **Total Conversion in Farthings**:\n   - Add the totals together: 960 farthings from the pound and 20 farthings from the 5 pence.\n   - Thus, \\(960 + 20 = 980\\) farthings.\n\n**Reflection and Double-checking**:\n- Quick thought: imagine doing each part on its own and verifying it using small test cases. If it works independently, that's a good sanity check.\n- Decimal verification in old systems can save from error, so recalculating some parts or thinking them through again can help reinforce confidence.\n\n**Final Thoughts**:\n- Everything seems to add up, and I carried out each step logically and systematically, so I'm pretty confident here.\n- Looks like the total number of farthings equivalent to 1 pound and 5 pence is \\(980\\).\n\nSo, the answer is **980 farthings**.",
