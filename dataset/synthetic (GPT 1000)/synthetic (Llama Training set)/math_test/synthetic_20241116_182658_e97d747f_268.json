    "working_out": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Looking at the problem, it seems we're dealing with a cube and a square, each with certain conditions tied to their areas and volumes. The objective is to find the side length of a square based on these conditions. \n\nFirst, let's summarize what we know:\n\n1. **Cube Constraints**:\n   - The surface area of the cube is equal to \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of its volume.\n\n   - Let's dissect that:\n     - Surface area of a cube = \\( 6s^2 \\) where \\( s \\) is the side length.\n     - Volume of a cube = \\( s^3 \\).\n\n2. **Square Relation**:\n   - The area of the square should equal the volume of the cube.\n   - Let the side length of the square be \\( t \\), so the area is \\( t^2 \\).\n\n### Structuring an Approach \n\nWe have two key equations or conditions:\n\n- \\( 6s^2 = \\frac{1}{6} \\times s^3 \\)\n- \\( t^2 = s^3 \\)\n\nLet's tackle one at a time.\n\n### Solving for \\( s \\)\n\nFirst, we need to solve the equation relating the surface area and volume of the cube:\n\n\\[ 6s^2 = \\frac{1}{6} \\times s^3 \\]\n\nHmm, to simplify this, let's multiply both sides by 6:\n\n\\[ 36s^2 = s^3 \\]\n\nThis can be rearranged to:\n\n\\[ s^3 - 36s^2 = 0 \\]\n\nHmm, okay, this looks like a quadratic in terms of \\( s \\). Let's factor it:\n\n\\[ s^2(s - 36) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions: \n\n1. \\( s^2 = 0 \\) which implies \\( s = 0 \\), but \\( s = 0 \\) wouldn't give us a valid cube. A cube with zero side length doesn't make sense in this context, so we discard this solution.\n\n2. \\( s - 36 = 0 \\) which implies \\( s = 36 \\).\n\nLet's double-check whether this solution makes sense given the original condition. If \\( s = 36 \\):\n\n- The surface area is \\( 6(36)^2 = 7776 \\).\n- The volume is \\( 36^3 = 46656 \\).\n- Indeed \\( 7776 = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 46656 \\) checks out, so \\( s = 36 \\) is correct.\n\n### Finding the Side Length of the Square\n\nNow that we have \\( s = 36 \\), we can find the side length \\( t \\) of the square. From the relation \\( t^2 = s^3 \\):\n\nGiven \\( s = 36 \\):\n\n- Volume of the cube is \\( 36^3 = 46656 \\).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ t^2 = 46656 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( t \\), we take the square root:\n\n\\[ t = \\sqrt{46656} \\]\n\nHmm, I feel like double-checking the square root calculation to be sure:\n\n\\( 36^2 = 1296 \\), so \\( 36 * 36 = 1296 \\).\n\nGiven that we calculated \\( t^2 = 46656 \\), I'll calculate it again to ensure:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{46656} = 216 \\]\n\nLet's verify:\n\n- \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\)\n- \\( 6 \\times 36 = 216 \\)\n\nIndeed it tracks, so \\( t = 216 \\) seems totally reasonable given all checks align.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe side length of the square that matches the volume of Sally's cube is \\( \\boxed{216} \\) units. Alright, feels like everything checks out\u2014seems exciting to work with these geometric relations!",

  "ground_truth": "First we know that surface area is 6 times the area of each face, or $6s^2$, and we set this equal to $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the volume. $$6s^2=\\frac{1}{6}s^3\\qquad\\Rightarrow 36s^2=s^3 \\qquad\\Rightarrow s=36$$Now we want a square of side length $a$ and area $a^2$ to have an area equal to the volume of the cube. $$a^2=s^3=36^3=(6^2)^3=6^6\\qquad\\Rightarrow a=\\sqrt{6^6}=6^3=216$$So the side length of the square should be $\\boxed{216}$."
