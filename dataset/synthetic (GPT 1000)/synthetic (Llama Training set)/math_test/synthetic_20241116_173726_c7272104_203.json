    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and start by unpacking it. We have the following two equations:\n\n1. \\(5a = -4b + 5\\)\n2. \\(3a = -2b + 3\\)\n\nWe need to find the value of \\(6b\\). \n\n### Brainstorming Phase\n\nFirst thoughts: This looks like a system of linear equations. I'm thinking maybe we can solve these equations simultaneously to find values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Once we have \\(b\\), multiplying it by 6 should give us the answer we need. \n\nLet's list out some potential strategies:\n- **Substitution:** Solve one equation for one variable and substitute it into the other. \n- **Elimination:** Try to eliminate one variable by combining the equations.\n- **Matrix Approach:** Use matrices and the inverse to solve, though this might be overkill for two equations.\n\nMy initial thought is to try substitution since these equations are fairly simple. It might keep the work straightforward.\n\n### Substitution Approach\n\nI'll start by solving the second equation for \\(a\\):\n\n\\[ 3a = -2b + 3 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3 to solve for \\(a\\):\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{-2b + 3}{3} \\]\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \\(a\\) in the first equation:\n\n\\[ 5\\left(\\frac{-2b + 3}{3}\\right) = -4b + 5 \\]\n\nOkay, now let's simplify this mess. I see that the left side can be simplified:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5(-2b + 3)}{3} = -4b + 5 \\]\n\nMultiply everything by 3 to clear the fraction:\n\n\\[ 5(-2b + 3) = 3(-4b + 5) \\]\n\nDistribute on both sides:\n\n\\[ -10b + 15 = -12b + 15 \\]\n\nCheck quickly: Does eliminating \\(b\\) make sense? Let's simplify further:\n\nAdd \\(12b\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[ 2b + 15 = 15 \\]\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2b = 0 \\]\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n\\[ b = 0 \\]\n\nHmm, let's pause and check if this could possibly be correct by substituting back.\n\n### Verification\n\nSubstitute \\(b = 0\\) back into both original equations:\n1. For the first equation \\(5a = -4(0) + 5\\), simplifying gives:\n   \\[5a = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = 1\\]\n\n2. For the second equation \\(3a = -2(0) + 3\\), this simplifies to:\n   \\[3a = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = 1\\]\n\nBoth equations give the same solution for \\(a\\) when \\(b = 0\\). This checks out!\n\n### Final Step\n\nNow, since \\(b = 0\\), we know:\n\n\\[ 6b = 6 \\times 0 = 0 \\]\n\nI think this looks correct! Everything checks out. There are no inconsistencies in substituting back into the original equations. \n\n#### Final Answer:\n\\(6b = 0\\)\n\nThat was actually a neat solution. Let\u2019s hope we didn\u2019t overlook anything!",

  "ground_truth": "First we begin by solving the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n5a&=-4b+5, \\\\\n3a&=-2b+3.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting two times the second equation from the first equation, we get $5a-2(3a)=-4b+5-2(-2b+3)$, which simplifies to $-a=-1$. So $a=1$ and plugging this into the first equation we obtain $5=-4b+5$. Solving for $b$, we find that $b=0$. Hence $6b=6\\cdot 0=\\boxed{0}$."
