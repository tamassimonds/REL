    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together and examine it from various angles.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first read this question, I think about the constraints: we have a collection of beads, but we have to arrange them into a necklace. My mind immediately goes to combinations since it's about choosing beads, but I remember that the issue of symmetry (rotations and reflections) complicates this matter. It seems similar to \"circular permutations,\" and I know they can be tricky due to the rotational symmetry aspect.\n\nThis is a bit intimidating, but I think I can break it down. Circular permutations usually involve dividing by the number of positions, but figuring in reflections adds complexity.\n\n**Step 1: Choosing Beads**\n\nFirst, let's tackle how to choose 5 beads out of the 8. This part feels straightforward.\n\nTo find how many ways we can choose 5 beads from 8, we use combinations. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in our numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{5} = \\frac{8!}{5! \\cdot 3!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 56 different sets of beads we can choose. Number seems reasonable for just choosing the beads, but next, we tackle the arrangement, specifically accounting for symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Arranging Beads in a Necklace**\n\nFor arranging beads in a circle (with no reflections considered yet), I recall that the formula for circular permutations is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n!}{n} = (n-1)!\n\\]\n\nThus, for arranging 5 beads in a circle, there are \\((5-1)! = 4! = 24\\) arrangements. But, because this is a necklace, reflections make arrangements like ABCDE and EDCBA equivalent.\n\n**Step 3: Accounting for Rotational and Reflection Symmetry**\n\nThis is where things get challenging. Reflective symmetry implies counting symmetrical structures only once. I've heard of a theorem by Polya or Burnside's Lemma for this, but let me try something simpler first.\n\nAnother technique that comes to mind is directly tweaking the formula for circular permutations in a case with reflection. I remember the formula for a bracelet (considering rotations and reflections) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(n-1)!}{2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in for \\(n = 5\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4!}{2} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n\\]\n\nThat gives us the unique circular arrangements considering symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Combine Choices and Arrangements**\n\nFinally, multiply the choices of beads by unique necklace arrangements:\n\n\\[\n56 \\times 12 = 672\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAt each step, the calculations seem reasonable. Factorials for choosing and permutations for arranging mentally make sense, and I accounted for symmetry correctly by considering it a bracelet. Looking at it holistically suits the question well. \n\nA quick cross-check: if I only consider choosing and heavily simplify arrangements (by reflecting on how smaller cases work), this approach seems spot-on.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere are **672 ways** to arrange five beads on a necklace using eight distinct beads, taking into account rotations and reflections. This number lines up with expectations after reviewing all steps and symmetry considerations.",

  "ground_truth": "Not considering rotations and reflections, there are 8 ways to choose the first bead to put on the necklace, followed by 7, 6, 5, and 4 ways to choose the next beads. For each arrangements of beads on the necklace, there are 5 ways to rotate it and another 5 ways to reflect it and then rotate it to another arrangement. Thus, arrangements of beads on the necklace come in groups of 10 equivalent arrangements. The total number of different arrangements is therefore $8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4/10=\\boxed{672}$."
