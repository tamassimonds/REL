    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by dissecting it step by step. At first glance, this seems like a sequence issue, but not a typical arithmetic or geometric one. We need to find the remainder when the sum of numbers formed by digits in a sequence (1, 12, 123, etc.) is divided by 5.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst, let's write down the sequence: 1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1234567, 12345678. \nThese numbers grow by adding an additional digit to the last number in the sequence, essentially forming a sequence with an increasing number of digits. \n\n**Step 2: Exploring Strategies**\n\nA potential strategy could be to perform long division to find remainders for each number in the sequence, but that seems tedious. Instead, let's explore pattern recognition in modulo arithmetic because the sequence of numbers (and their formation) might mean repetitive behavior mod 5, since 5 is a small modulus.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Individual Remainders**\n\nLet's calculate the remainder of each number when divided by 5 individually:\n- \\(1 \\mod 5 = 1\\)\n- \\(12 \\mod 5 = 2\\)  (since \\(12 = 2 \\times 5 + 2\\))\n- \\(123 \\mod 5 = 3\\) (since \\(123 = 24 \\times 5 + 3\\))\n- \\(1234 \\mod 5 = 4\\) (since \\(1234 = 246 \\times 5 + 4\\))\n- \\(12345 \\mod 5 = 0\\) (since \\(12345 = 2469 \\times 5 + 0\\))\n- \\(123456 \\mod 5 = 1\\) (since \\(123456 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\\))\n- \\(1234567 \\mod 5 = 2\\) (since \\(1234567 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}\\))\n- \\(12345678 \\mod 5 = 3\\) (since \\(12345678 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}\\))\n\n**Step 4: Sum the Remainders**\n\nBy adding up the remainders:\n\\[1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 16\\]\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Remainder of the Sum**\n\nNow, find the remainder of this sum when divided by 5:\n\\[16 \\mod 5 = 1\\]\n\n**Step 6: Verify and Reflect**\n\nGiven the calculations above, it seems correct that the sum of all remainders is 16. When divided by 5, the remainder is 1.\n\nA quick mental check of going through the large numbers and pattern finding confirms that these calculations align with our expected behavior: since the last digits of numbers usually determine the modulo with small numbers.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFinally, the remainder when \\(1 + 12 + 123 + 1234 + 12345 + 123456 + 1234567 + 12345678\\) is divided by 5 is \\(1\\).\n\nIn the process, it was insightful to explore the sequence through modulo and find a repeating behavior that made calculations far more manageable than they could have been with direct division. This approach highlights the power of recognizing patterns in numbers for manipulating sequences efficiently.",
