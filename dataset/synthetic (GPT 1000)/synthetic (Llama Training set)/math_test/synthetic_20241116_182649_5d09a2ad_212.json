    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The goal here is to find an integer \\( n \\) such that \\(\\tan n^\\circ = \\tan 252^\\circ\\) with \\(-90 < n < 90\\). \n\n**First Impressions**\n\nRight off the bat, I know that the tangent function has a periodicity of \\(180^\\circ\\). This means that \\(\\tan \\theta = \\tan (\\theta + 180k)\\) for any integer \\(k\\). So my instinct is to leverage this property to find \\(n\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming**\n\n- First, since \\(\\tan 252^\\circ\\) is given, it might be useful to find what this angle corresponds to within one full circle, i.e., within \\([0^\\circ, 360^\\circ)\\).\n\n- I could also think about the unit circle. The angle \\(252^\\circ\\) is in the third quadrant where tangent is positive.\n\n- I\u2019m aiming to find an equivalent angle for \\(\\tan\\) within the range \\(-90 < n < 90\\), so that means looking for angles where the tangent is the same, but reflected into this narrower range.\n\n**Step 1: Reducing the Angle Using Periodicity**\n\nSince \\(\\tan\\) has a period of \\(180^\\circ\\),\n\\[\n\\tan 252^\\circ = \\tan (252^\\circ - 180^\\circ) = \\tan 72^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nOh! I can already feel I\u2019m going in the right direction because \\(72^\\circ\\) is within \\([0^\\circ, 90^\\circ]\\), which is closer to the desired range \\( -90 < n < 90 \\).\n\n**Step Check**\n\n- Does this angle (\\(72^\\circ\\)) fit within the range for \\(n\\)? Well, yes, because it is positive and less than \\(90^\\circ\\).\n- Given the restriction set by the problem condition, we want an integer \\(n\\). Here, \\(n\\) could potentially be \\(72\\).\n\n**Second Approach (Reflection)**\n\nBut, I must double-check: \\(\\tan\\) is also periodic modulo \\(360^\\circ\\), and I need to confirm there\u2019s no alternative within the specified range.\n\n- Given \\(\\tan\\) symmetry, \\( \\tan(n) = \\tan(-n)\\), hence considering \\( \\tan(-108^\\circ) = \\tan(72^\\circ) \\), but \\(-108^\\circ\\) doesn\u2019t fit our range.\n\n**Final Thoughts and Verification**\n\n- I could reflect about zero by considering negative solutions, but since \\(\\tan(72^\\circ)\\) and \\(72^\\circ\\) already fit perfectly into the constraints \\(-90 < n < 90\\), attempting to verify other possibilities should show less or incomplete fit.\n\n- With all reflections and checks considered, \\(n = 72\\) is both meeting the condition \\(\\tan n^\\circ = \\tan 252^\\circ\\) and within the proper interval.\n\nThe integer \\(n\\) satisfying the conditions of the problem is \\(72\\).",
