    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: factor \\(9z^3 - 27z^2 + 27z\\).\n\n**Step 1: First Impressions and Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I notice it's a polynomial with powers of \\(z\\). It looks like it can be simplified by factoring. The coefficients are all multiples of 9, which seems significant. It feels like I've solved similar problems before by looking for a common factor first.\n\n**Step 2: Exploring Initial Strategies**\n\nLet me think about my options here. One typical way to start is by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of all the terms. Another strategy could be to look for some kind of pattern or special factorization like difference of squares, but it doesn't look like a classic case of that. Considering the structure of this expression, starting with the GCF seems like a good first step.\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Greatest Common Factor**\n\nI identify the coefficients 9, 27, and 27. The GCF of these numbers is 9. Also, each term contains at least one \\(z\\), so \\(z\\) is also part of the GCF. Let's factor out \\(9z\\).\n\n\\[\n9z^3 - 27z^2 + 27z = 9z(z^2 - 3z + 3)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection: Does This Make Sense?**\n\nAfter factoring out \\(9z\\), I have \\(9z(z^2 - 3z + 3)\\). I think that looks correct. Quick double-check: multiplying back gives me the original expression \\(9z^3 - 27z^2 + 27z\\). So, it seems I factored this part correctly.\n\n**Step 4: Further Factoring the Quadratic**\n\nNow I have the quadratic \\(z^2 - 3z + 3\\). Let me take a closer look to see if it can be factored further. I'm considering the possibility of simple trinomial factorization, but the standard formulas don't seem to apply nicely here. \n\nI quickly review the discriminant, \\(b^2 - 4ac\\), for the quadratic formula which might indicate if this can be factored over the integers. Here, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -3\\), and \\(c = 3\\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 3 = 9 - 12 = -3\n\\]\n\nThe discriminant is negative, implying that \\(z^2 - 3z + 3\\) does not factor over the real numbers. It seems further factoring into integer factors isn't possible.\n\n**Final Step: Conclusion**\n\nSince I can't break down \\(z^2 - 3z + 3\\) further using integer factorization, my simplest factorization of the original expression remains \\(9z(z^2 - 3z + 3)\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe factorization of \\(9z^3 - 27z^2 + 27z\\) is:\n\n\\[ 9z(z^2 - 3z + 3) \\]\n\nThroughout this process, I reflected on the steps to ensure accuracy, rechecked certain calculations, and arrived at a solution based on the polynomial's characteristics. This feels like a solid stopping point since further real-number factorization isn't possible.",

  "ground_truth": "Both 9 and $z$ are factors of each term, so we can factor out $9z$: \\[9z^3 -27z^2 + 27z = (9z)\\cdot(z^2) - (9z)\\cdot (3z) + (9z)\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{9z(z^2 - 3z + 3)}.\\]"
