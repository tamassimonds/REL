    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this step-by-step. When I first see this problem, it's all about converting units from flicks to flecks and then from flecks to flocks. It's clearly a chain of conversions, almost like those classic unit conversion problems.\n\nFirst thoughts: \n1. This problem is asking us to convert between different fictional units, which means it's very much like a ratio or proportion problem. \n2. I'll probably need to understand the relationships between these fictional units first, then see how they stack up to each other.\n\n- First, let's break it down: We have flicks, flecks, and flocks. These have some sort of equivalence to each other. \n\nInitial facts:\n- 3 flicks = 8 flecks\n- 6 flocks = 4 flecks\n\n**Step 1**: Convert flicks to flecks.\n\nI'm tasked with converting 12 flicks to flecks first because I know how flicks relate to flecks.\n\n- If 3 flicks are equivalent to 8 flecks, then 12 flicks would be some multiple of flecks. I immediately think about setting up a proportion:  \n    - \\( \\frac{3 \\text{ flicks}}{8 \\text{ flecks}} = \\frac{12 \\text{ flicks}}{X \\text{ flecks}} \\)\n  \n- Solving this proportion involves cross-multiplying:\n  \n  \\[\n  3X = 8 \\times 12\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  3X = 96\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  X = \\frac{96}{3} = 32\n  \\]\n\n- So, 12 flicks are equivalent to 32 flecks. That step made sense! Let me pause for a moment just to reflect on this\u2014it feels right that I've consistently expanded the scale and solved correctly.\n\n**Step 2**: Convert flecks to flocks.\n\nNow, I have the number of flecks (32) from 12 flicks, and I need to convert flecks into flocks.\n\n- The given relationship here is: 6 flocks = 4 flecks.\n\n- I need 32 flecks converted to flocks, so setting up a proportion again comes to mind:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{6 \\text{ flocks}}{4 \\text{ flecks}} = \\frac{Y \\text{ flocks}}{32 \\text{ flecks}}\n  \\]\n\n- Solving this proportion by cross-multiplying gives:\n\n  \\[\n  4Y = 6 \\times 32\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  4Y = 192\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  Y = \\frac{192}{4} = 48\n  \\]\n\n- That clicks into place\u201432 flecks convert into 48 flocks.\n\nBefore I wrap this up, let me quickly check if my logic's consistent by reflecting: I properly expanded each step of the way through the flicks to flecks relationship and flecks to flocks. When checked proportionally, the numbers align as expected.\n\n**Conclusion**: \n\nTherefore, 12 flicks are equivalent to 48 flocks. \n\nThis feels like one of those solid problem-solving flows, where each part builds on the last. I checked my math as I went, and everything adds up. Problem solved!",

  "ground_truth": "If three flicks are equivalent to eight flecks, then twelve flicks are equivalent to $4 \\cdot 8 = 32$ flecks. Also, $32$ flecks are equivalent to $(32\\ \\text{flecks}) \\cdot \\frac{6\\ \\text{flocks}}{4\\ \\text{flecks}} = 48\\ \\text{flocks}$. Thus, $\\boxed{48}$ flocks are equivalent to $12$ flicks."
