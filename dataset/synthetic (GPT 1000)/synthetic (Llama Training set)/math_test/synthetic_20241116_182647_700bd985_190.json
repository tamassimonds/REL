    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find a matrix \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) that reflects any vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) through the \\(xy\\)-plane. Let\u2019s brainstorm and think through this:\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n\n1. **Understanding Reflection**: When we talk about reflecting a vector through the \\(xy\\)-plane, it essentially means that the \\(z\\)-component of the vector changes sign, while the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) components remain unchanged. So, if a vector \\(\\mathbf{v} = (x, y, z)\\), then the reflection across the \\(xy\\)-plane would result in \\((x, y, -z)\\).\n\n2. **Matrix Representation**: Since we\u2019re looking for a matrix \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) that achieves this transformation for any vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) should be a \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix because \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a 3-dimensional vector.\n\n### Approach Brainstorming:\n\n1. **Recalling Properties**: Reflection matrices usually have forms that switch signs of specific components. For the \\(xy\\)-plane, this will affect the \\(z\\)-component.\n\n2. **Constructing the Matrix**: Think about how matrices act on vectors through multiplication. We'll want the matrix to leave the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) components unchanged and change \\(z\\) to \\(-z\\).\n\n3. **Formulate Hypotheses**: I hypothesize that the matrix might look something like:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{R} = \n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & -1\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n   This intuitively makes sense because multiplying the vector \\((x, y, z)\\) by this matrix should give us \\((x, y, -z)\\).\n\n### Detailed Calculation:\n\nNow, let's verify if our hypothesis for \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) actually works by performing the matrix multiplication.\n\n\\[\\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{v} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\cdot x + 0 \\cdot y + 0 \\cdot z \\\\\n0 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot y + 0 \\cdot z \\\\\n0 \\cdot x + 0 \\cdot y + (-1) \\cdot z\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\n-z\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\n### Reflecting on Solution:\n\n- **Does it match the requirement?** Yes, the output vector \\((x, y, -z)\\) matches exactly with what's required when reflecting through the \\(xy\\)-plane.\n  \n- **Is the approach valid?** Absolutely, the linear transformation set by our matrix accurately represents a reflection about the \\(xy\\)-plane. The structure of the matrix is consistent with standard reflection matrices.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter verifying the matrix multiplication and confirming that the result matches the expected transformation, I\u2019m confident that the matrix \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is indeed \n\\[\n\\mathbf{R} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThis matrix properly reflects any vector through the \\(xy\\)-plane by changing the sign of the \\(z\\)-component and keeping the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) components unchanged.",
