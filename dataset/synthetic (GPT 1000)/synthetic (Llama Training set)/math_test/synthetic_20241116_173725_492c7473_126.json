    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: We need to find the least possible value of \\(k\\) in the given equation \\(k = (6x + 12)(x - 8)\\). This looks like a quadratic equation that's been factored. I recall from algebra that the minimum value of a quadratic equation occurs at the vertex when \\(a > 0\\).\n\n2. **Equation Format**: We have a product of binomials, not a standard form quadratic. It would help to expand this to see the quadratic form. \n\n3. **Strategy Brainstorm**: I remember the vertex formula for a quadratic equation can also be useful. But let's first expand the equation into a standard quadratic form.\n\nStep-by-Step Breakdown:\n\n**Step 1**: **Expand the Equation**\n\\[ k = (6x + 12)(x - 8) \\]\nDistribute the terms:\n\\[ k = 6x \\cdot x + 6x \\cdot (-8) + 12 \\cdot x + 12 \\cdot (-8) \\]\n\\[ k = 6x^2 - 48x + 12x - 96 \\] \nCombine like terms:\n\\[ k = 6x^2 - 36x - 96 \\]\n\n**Step 2**: **Confirm the Quadratic Form**\nThe equation is now \\( k = 6x^2 - 36x - 96 \\), matching the standard quadratic form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\). Here, \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = -36\\), \\(c = -96\\).\n\n**Step 3**: **Find the Vertex**\nFor the minimum value of \\(k\\) (since \\(a > 0\\)), we use the vertex formula: \n\\[ x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\]\nPlug in \\(b = -36\\) and \\(a = 6\\):\n\\[ x = -\\frac{-36}{2 \\times 6} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{36}{12} \\]\n\\[ x = 3 \\]\n\n**Step 4**: **Calculate the Minimum Value of \\(k\\)**\nSubstitute \\(x = 3\\) back into the quadratic equation:\n\\[ k = 6(3)^2 - 36(3) - 96 \\]\n\\[ k = 6 \\times 9 - 108 - 96 \\]\n\\[ k = 54 - 108 - 96 \\]\n\\[ k = 54 - 204 \\]\n\\[ k = -150 \\]\n\nReflections and Checks:\n\n- **Quick Check**: The steps seem right. I expanded correctly, derived the quadratic terms, and accurately used the vertex formula.\n- **Sense Check**: The process to find the minimum makes sense since \\(a\\) is positive, and the vertex represents a minimum.\n- **Deep Reflection**: Consider rechecking each calculation step, particularly when substituting to ensure I didn\u2019t make arithmetic errors. \n\n**Conclusion**: The least possible value of \\(k\\) is \\(-150\\). \n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\n- **Different Approaches**: Although I used expansion and the vertex formula, I could have potentially completed the square as an alternative if needed.\n- **Confidence in Answer**: Revisiting all calculations confirms accuracy. The method logically leads to the resultant minimum value.",

  "ground_truth": "Suppose we consider the equation $y = (6x + 12)(x - 8)$, which is equivalent to $y = 6x^2 - 36x - 96$. Then the graph of this equation is a parabola opening upward, with a minimum at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic equation is located at the point where $x = -b/(2a)$. (This is the first part of the quadratic formula.)\n\nIn this case, we have $x = -(-36)/(2 \\times 6) = 36/12 = 3$. The $y$-value at this point is $y = (6 \\times 3 + 12)(3 - 8) = (30)(-5) = \\boxed{-150}$, which is also our minimum value of $k$."
