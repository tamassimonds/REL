    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle the problem \\(0.8\\overline{4} - 0.\\overline{4}\\). My first impression is that we're dealing with repeating decimals, which can sometimes be tricky to convert into fractions. But I remember converting repeating decimals to fractions before, so this should be manageable. Let's brainstorm some strategies to break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand and Interpret the Problem\nThe problem involves two repeating decimals:\n- \\(0.8\\overline{4}\\) means 0.844444... (where 4 repeats forever).\n- \\(0.\\overline{4}\\) means 0.44444... (where 4 repeats forever).\n\nOur goal is to subtract the second decimal from the first and express the result as a common fraction.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Each Repeating Decimal to a Fraction\n\n**Strategy for Conversion:** \nOne approach is to set the repeating decimal as a variable \\(x\\), then use mathematical manipulation to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n#### Convert \\(0.8\\overline{4}\\) to a Fraction\n- Let \\(x = 0.8\\overline{4}\\).\n- Writing it explicitly: \\(x = 0.8444...\\).\n- Multiply by 10 to shift the decimal: \\(10x = 8.444...\\).\n- Multiply by 100 to ensure two cycles of the repeat: \\(100x = 84.444...\\).\n\nNotice a pattern with 10x and 100x:\n- \\(100x - 10x = 84.444... - 8.444...\\).\n- Simplifying gives: \\(90x = 76\\).\n- Solve for \\(x\\): \\(x = \\frac{76}{90}\\).\n- Simplifying the fraction: \\(x = \\frac{38}{45}\\).\n\n**Quick Check:** The denominator and numerator share no further common factors. It looks correct, let\u2019s move forward.\n\n#### Convert \\(0.\\overline{4}\\) to a Fraction\n- Let \\(y = 0.\\overline{4}\\).\n- Writing explicitly: \\(y = 0.444...\\).\n- Multiply by 10 to shift the decimal: \\(10y = 4.444...\\).\n\nSubtract:\n- \\(10y - y = 4.444... - 0.444...\\) simplifies to \\(9y = 4\\).\n- Solve for \\(y\\): \\(y = \\frac{4}{9}\\).\n\n**Quick Check:** Factors of 4 and 9 do not allow simplification. This looks correct as well.\n\n### Step 3: Subtract the Fractions\nNow we're looking to subtract the two fractions obtained:\n\\[\n\\frac{38}{45} - \\frac{4}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Finding a Common Denominator:**\n- The denominators 45 and 9 share a common multiple of 45.\n- Convert \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\) to \\(\\frac{20}{45}\\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4}{9} \\times \\frac{5}{5} = \\frac{20}{45}\n  \\]\n\nSubtract the two fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{38}{45} - \\frac{20}{45} = \\frac{18}{45}\n\\]\n\n**Simplify:**\n- Both 18 and 45 are divisible by 9.\n- Simplifying: \n  \\[\n  \\frac{18}{45} = \\frac{2}{5}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Reflect\nIt seems I made it through the simplification correctly. The calculations check out with intermediate results that make logical sense. \\(2/5\\) is indeed a plausible reduction based on the initial subtraction. So, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}\n\\] \n\nThis accounts thoroughly for the method of converting repeating decimals into fractions, followed by arithmetic operations. Reflecting on this method gives confidence; it\u2019s methodical with all necessary checks.",
