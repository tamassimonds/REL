    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem step by step. \n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nFirst thoughts: The problem talks about integers with exactly three positive divisors. I need to list them in ascending order and find the fifth number. This sounds specific, but let\u2019s break it down.\n\n- A number with exactly three divisors\u2014is that common? I think it's rare, possibly some special kind of number.\n- Need to think: what gives an integer exactly three factors? I remember that typically a square of a prime number fits this condition because if `p` is a prime, then `p^2` has three divisors: 1, `p`, and `p^2`.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\nStrategy idea: Perhaps list out a few squared primes, check their divisors and see if they have exactly three. If they do, list them.\n\n- Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7,... These are my candidates for `p`.\n- Check if `p^2` has three divisors:\n  - \\(2^2 = 4\\) \u2192 Divisors: 1, 2, 4 (Yes, 3 divisors)\n  - \\(3^2 = 9\\) \u2192 Divisors: 1, 3, 9 (Yes, 3 divisors)\n  - \\(5^2 = 25\\) \u2192 Divisors: 1, 5, 25 (Yes, 3 divisors)\n  - \\(7^2 = 49\\) \u2192 Divisors: 1, 7, 49 (Yes, 3 divisors)\n  - \\(11^2 = 121\\) \u2192 Divisors: 1, 11, 121 (Yes, 3 divisors)\n\nThese numbers all seem to have exactly three divisors because squaring a prime results in the form that only allows three divisors.\n\n**Generating the List:**\n\nList these squares of the first few prime numbers in ascending order:\n\n1. \\(4\\) (from 2)\n2. \\(9\\) (from 3)\n3. \\(25\\) (from 5)\n4. \\(49\\) (from 7)\n5. \\(121\\) (from 11)\n\nChecking reflections: The approach so far seems to work. I have identified that squares of prime numbers have exactly three divisors, and they are generated correctly above.\n\nDouble-check: Have I considered the integer constraint (they are all positive integers)? Yes, all are integers and positive.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe fifth number with exactly three divisors is \\(121\\).\n\nReflect: This approach makes sense because using the prime squares allowed me to directly generate numbers with three divisors in the smallest form naturally by ascending order.\n\nQuick re-thought: There aren't any simpler numbers fitting this criteria overlooked since smaller non-square numbers have more divisors or don\u2019t meet the condition.\n\nFinal thought: Feels correct based on checked work and small list progression, as every step check aligned with the known arithmetic property of divisor count with prime squares. \n\nThus, the fifth number is confirmed to be \\(121\\).",

  "ground_truth": "If an integer has at least two different prime factors, say, $p$ and $q$, then it must have at least four positive divisors: $1$, $p$, $q$, and $pq$. So, for a number to have exactly three positive divisors, it must be a power of a single prime number. The positive divisors of $p^n$ are $1,p,p^2,p^3,\\cdots,p^{n-1},p^n$. Therefore, $p^n$ has $n+1$ different positive divisors, and the only positive integers with exactly three positive divisors are the squares of prime numbers.\n\nThe five smallest such integers are, in ascending order, $2^2$, $3^2$, $5^2$, $7^2$, and $11^2$. The fifth number listed is $11^2=\\boxed{121}$."
