My task is to evaluate it step by step.\n   - This looks like a problem involving rules of exponents, specifically the power of a power rule.\n\n2. **Potential Strategies:**\n   - **Strategy 1:** Apply the power of a power rule, which says \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\).\n   - **Strategy 2:** Maybe break this down to smaller steps by evaluating \\(2^3\\) first, and then applying the fractional exponent.\n   - **Strategy 3:** Think about simplifying with properties of exponents. This might be similar to simplifying radicals since \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) is a fraction.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Apply Power of a Power Rule\n- **Thought Process:** I remember the power of a power rule. It suggests that \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\). Seems straightforward, let's try it.\n- **Calculation:** \n  \\[\n  (2^3)^{\\frac{4}{3}} = 2^{3 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}}\n  \\]\n\n#### Step 2: Simplify the Exponents\n- **Thought Process:** Now simplify the exponent's multiplication. This step involves basic arithmetic.\n- **Calculation:** \n  \\[\n  3 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = 4\n  \\]\n- **Reflection:** Okay, it seems straightforward so far. I can't see any mistakes at this point.\n\n#### Step 3: Solve the Simplified Exponential\n- **Thought Process:** Now, I've got a new, simpler expression to evaluate: \\(2^4\\).\n- **Calculation:** \n  \\[\n  2^4 = 16\n  \\]\n\n#### Step 4: Check the Work\n- **Quick Check:** Let me go back through my steps quickly to ensure there wasn't a mistake. Follow through with each of the steps. \n   - I applied the rules correctly, multiplied correctly, and evaluated correctly.\n   - So everything checks out.\n\n#### Final Result\n- **Conclusion:** The value of the expression \\((2^3)^{\\frac{4}{3}}\\) is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).\n\n### Reflection on Approach\n- **Strategy Review:** The first strategy I picked using the power of a power rule worked perfectly here. Breaking it into smaller tasks helped clarify each part.\n- **Insight:** Noticing the power rule was key, and sometimes these problems are a matter of recognizing those familiar patterns.\n\nThat's the complete thought process and solution for the given problem.",
