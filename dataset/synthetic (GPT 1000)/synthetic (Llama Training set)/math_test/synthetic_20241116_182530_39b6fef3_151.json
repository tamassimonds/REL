    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem step by step. The question asks about determining the day of the week 270 days after March 1, which is a Monday. Here\u2019s my thought process:\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nAlright, I've seen problems like this before that deal with calculating future days based on a given day. 270 days feel like a large number, but intuitively, it seems manageable. I know that I can start by figuring out the total number of weeks involved, since days of the week repeat every 7 days. Let me jot down my initial plan:\n\n- Calculate how many full weeks are in 270 days.\n- Find the remainder days since they will determine the actual day of the week.\n- Use a calendar or day counting to verify the solution.\n\nOh, hold on! Considering \"weeks\" is a classic strategy for problems involving days of the week. But I wonder if there\u2019s something I've overlooked with the exact months. Let me think about that...\n\n### Step 1: Convert Days to Weeks\nFirst, it's crucial to determine how many complete weeks are in 270 days. Let's do this simple division.\n\\[ \n270 \\div 7 = 38 \\text{ R } 4 \n\\]\nWait a second! Just got an idea\u2014let\u2019s break this down even more. This means 270 days consist of 38 full weeks and an additional 4 days.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Day Based on Remainder\nThe additional 4 days after 38 weeks are the key to finding the day of the week:\n- If March 1 is a Monday, then 38 weeks will bring us back to another Monday.\n- Now, add those leftover 4 days: \n\n  - **Monday** (Day 0: Starting point)\n  - **Tuesday** (Day 1)\n  - **Wednesday** (Day 2)\n  - **Thursday** (Day 3)\n  - **Friday** (Day 4)\n\nSo, 270 days later should be a Friday.\n\n### Reflect and Double Check\nIt's always good to reflect on what we've calculated. Let's think deeply about whether our approach makes sense. \n\n- **Quick Check**: 270 days is nearly 9 months\u2014it feels right. Since weeks repeat every 7 days, the math should be sound after breaking the 270 into weeks + remainder days.\n- **Deeper Reflection**: The division checks out. The cycle of weekdays every 7 days aligns perfectly with both methods: directly counting and aligning with calendar changes.\n\n### Verification\nJust to be sure, I\u2019ll do a quick mental calendar walkthrough:\n- Crucially, since we started on Monday, after exactly 38 weeks we are back to Monday. \n- Counting four days forward from Monday reinforces the estimate of Friday.\n\n### Final Thought\nI\u2019m confident in my solution that 270 days after March 1, which is a Monday, lands on a Friday. It\u2019s interesting to step back and imagine how useful similar processes can be across different time calculations. \n\nHave I considered every angle? Well, while I didn't need to account for months specifically since everything fell into place with weeks and days, it aligns with broader year calculations too. Seeing this method in action can almost feel like cracking a code\u2014almost there yet reflected deeply alongside mathematical checks.\n\nWhew! There we have it. That was a satisfying conclusion\u2014it\u2019s fulfilling to see reason and calculated reassurance align!",

  "ground_truth": "Since there are $7$ days in a week, we first divide $270$ by $7$ to get $38 \\text{ R}4$. Therefore, there are $38$ weeks and $4$ days in $270$ days. Since it is still Monday $38$ weeks after March 1, we consider the extra four days. Four days after a Monday is a $\\boxed{\\text{Friday}}$."
