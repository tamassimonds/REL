    "working_out": "Great, let's dive into the problem step by step. This is a bit like inviting someone into your thought process, so let's keep it real and honest.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst thoughts... Okay, this looks like a typical problem involving the roots of a polynomial. The polynomial given is \\( x^3 + 7x^2 - 11x - 2 = 0 \\), and we need to find the sum of its roots. Instantly, I'm reminded of Vieta's formulas because they relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. I suspect that's what I need here.\n\n**Step 2: Revisiting Vieta's Formulas**\n\nLet's bring Vieta's formulas into focus. They tell us that for a polynomial of the form \\( ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \\ldots + k = 0 \\), the sum of the roots taken one at a time (with their sign changed) is \\(-b/a\\).\n\nHere, the polynomial \\(x^3 + 7x^2 - 11x - 2 = 0\\) is in standard form. \n\n- The coefficient \\(a\\) is 1 (that's the coefficient of \\(x^3\\)).\n- The coefficient \\(b\\) is 7 (that's the coefficient of \\(x^2\\)).\n\nAccording to Vieta, the sum of the roots \\(a + b + c = -\\frac{b}{a} = -\\frac{7}{1} = -7\\).\n\n**Step 3: Reflect and Double-Check**\n\nThis was pretty straightforward, but let's verify. We assumed that Vieta's formulas apply, and that assumption hinges on the polynomial being correctly assumed to have its coefficients. I didn't see any sign issues; the \\(x^2\\) term's coefficient is indeed \\(7\\). \n\nI'm confident in how Vieta's formulas apply here because they are a well-established mathematical principle for handling the sums of roots of polynomials given in standard form.\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification**\n\nQuick thought, any risk of overcomplication? Sometimes, when a solution seems too straightforward, I worry about missing nuances. But here, there\u2019s nothing extraordinary like complex roots or factoring needed just to find \\(a + b + c\\).\n\nAny extraneous insight? No need here, but a reconfirmation: it's entirely consistent with Vieta\u2019s idea that for a cubic polynomial \\(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\\), \\(a + b + c = - \\frac{b}{a}\\).\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nAlright, having run through this systematically, the sum of the roots \\(a + b + c\\) is \\( \\boxed{-7} \\). It aligns well with the theoretical basis, the process involved no unnecessary deviations, and the calculation checks out. That feels solid, and it didn\u2019t need a second strategy because Vieta\u2019s formulas straightforwardly tell us the sum of the roots.",
