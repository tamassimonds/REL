    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem. We need to find the coefficient of \\(x^3y^3z^2\\) in the expansion of \\((x+y+z)^8\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basics\n\nInitially, when facing a problem like this, it reminds me of the multinomial theorem. It seems similar to the binomial theorem, which I've dealt with before, except here we have three variables instead of two. The multinomial theorem could be a powerful tool here.\n\n**The multinomial theorem** states that:\n\n\\[\n(x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_k)^n = \\sum \\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\\cdots n_k!} x_1^{n_1} x_2^{n_2} \\cdots x_k^{n_k}\n\\]\n\nwhere the sum is over all combinations of non-negative integer indices \\(n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k\\) such that the sum of these indices equals \\(n\\), i.e., \\(n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_k = n\\).\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Multinomial Theorem\n\nIn our case, \\(x_1 = x\\), \\(x_2 = y\\), \\(x_3 = z\\), and \\(n = 8\\). We are looking for the specific term where \\(x^3y^3z^2\\) appears, which means we want \\(n_1 = 3\\), \\(n_2 = 3\\), and \\(n_3 = 2\\).\n\nLet's set it up: We have three variables (\\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\)) and they are raised to powers that add up to 8. It seems like:\n\n\\[ \nn_1 = 3, \\, n_2 = 3, \\, n_3 = 2 \n\\]\n\nIt's satisfying that \\(3 + 3 + 2 = 8\\), so we are on the right track.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation Using the Multinomial Coefficient\n\nNow, we need to calculate the coefficient of this term, which is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8!}{3!3!2!}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating each factorial:**\n\n- \\(8! = 40320\\)\n- \\(3! = 6\\)\n- Another \\(3! = 6\\)\n- \\(2! = 2\\)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{8!}{3!3!2!} = \\frac{40320}{6 \\times 6 \\times 2}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the denominator:\n\n\\[ \n6 \\times 6 = 36 \n\\]\n\\[ \n36 \\times 2 = 72 \n\\]\n\nNow, divide the numerator by the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{40320}{72} = 560 \n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Verification and Reflection\n\nI went through the calculations step-by-step, and everything seems to match up logically. We verified that the powers add to 8, and the factorials were calculated correctly. Let me take a moment to review the logic. It seems consistent with examples from previous experiences with similar multinomial expansions.\n\nAn insightful reflection tells me that yes, everything aligns well, and the approach using the multinomial theorem was appropriate given the problem constraints.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe coefficient of \\(x^3y^3z^2\\) in the expansion of \\((x+y+z)^8\\) is \\(\\boxed{560}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The Binomial Theorem says that, to find the coefficient of $x^ay^b$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^{a+b}$, we choose $a$ of the $(a+b)$ terms to contribute $x$ to the product, then the other $b$ terms contribute a $y$. Similarly, to find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in $(x+y+z)^8$, we choose 3 of the 8 $(x+y+z)$ terms in the product $(x+y+z)^8$ to contribute an $x$ (which we can do in $\\binom{8}{3}$ ways), 3 of the remaining 5 terms to contribute a $y$ (which we can do in $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways), and the remaining 2 terms contribute $z$'s to the product. Thus, our answer is  \\[\\binom{8}{3}\\binom{5}{3}=56\\cdot 10=\\boxed{560}\\]"
