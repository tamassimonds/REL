    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this subtraction puzzle step by step. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nFirst, let's carefully unpack the question. The subtraction problem is presented in base 4, as denoted by the subscript \"4\". This suggests that both the subtraction and any potential \"carrying\" must be handled using base 4 rules. I see that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are digits in base 4, so they can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The subtraction itself seems straightforward, but the base 4 aspect is key. \n\n### Step 1: Understand what's being asked\n\nThe subtraction problem is structured as:\n\n```\n    A B\n  - B A\n  -----\n      3\n```\n\nOur goal is to identify what digits \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) represent and find their nonnegative difference, |A - B|.\n\n### Step 2: Explore potential strategies\n\nOne approach would be to try matching the rightmost digits directly first and see if they satisfy the equation without carrying. Alternatively, if it seems like there may be carrying involved (due to the subtraction), I should be prepared to explore that scenario too. Let\u2019s first check the simplest case where no carrying is involved:\n\n1. **Consider each digit separately**: The immediate line indicates \u201cB - A = 3\u201d in base 4. \n\n### Step 3: Trial and Error with straightforward subtraction\n\nLet\u2019s try various combinations to make this equation true:\n\n- **\\(B = 3\\):** Subtract \\(A\\) from 3.\n  - If \\(A = 0\\), \\(3 - 0 = 3\\). This matches perfectly!\n  - Other values (1, 2, 3) either result in a carry or non-zero conclusion directly, but especially \\(3 - 1 = 2, 3 - 2= 1, 3 - 3 = 0\\), which doesn't work as we're given results must exactly yield 3 without a problem.\n\n### Step 4: Double-check configurations\n\nSince \\(B\\) cannot be negative, reassessing from the above:\n\n- \\(B = 3\\) and \\(A = 0\\) is definitely a potential solution. Here, there can't be any carrying needed since subtraction directly results in 3 within base 4.\n\nNow let\u2019s check for potential issues or alternative solutions by attention to subtraction:\n\n- If \\(A = 1\\) and \\(B = 2\\), subtracting does result in 3 when corrected within base 4: \n  \\[\n    B - A = (2 - 1) \\to 3\n  \\]\n\n### Reflect and Verify\n\nAha! The immediate validation here shows that:\n\n1. **Subtraction Verification**:\n   - In the case where no carry occurs, and \\(B - A = 3\\) only requires examining \\(B = 3\\) and \\(A = 0\\) directly through the straightforward process of calculation (2 - 1 transforming into 3 in aggregate due to overflow).\n\nHaving determined valid arithmetic directly:\n\n\\[\n|A - B| = |0 - 3| = 3\n\\]\n\nFeel satisfied with checking this logic twice and confirm by trying no mishaps, verifying it follows base 4 rules explicitly to provide conclusive insight. Other potential configurations are not yielding a 3 without carrying (if indeed there were any valid ones left unchecked). \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the subtraction validates: the nonnegative difference between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(|0 - 3| = 3\\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial analysis of the subtraction problem. Let's reassess the situation and work through the problem again, integrating the correct approach as I go.\n\n### Revisiting the Problem\n\nWe have the subtraction problem in base 4:\n\n```\n    A B\n  - B A\n  -----\n      3\n```\n\nThe nonnegative difference \\(|A - B|\\) needs to be determined, and it seems my earlier interpretation didn't consider borrowing properly. Let's re-evaluate the situation:\n\n### Exploring Different Strategies\n\n1. **Check for Borrowing in Subtraction**: \n   - My earlier solution assumed straightforward subtraction, but let's reassess with the possibility of borrowing.\n\n2. **Re-evaluate from the Rightmost Column**: \n   - The right column shows \\(B - A = 3\\) in base 4. This directly isn't feasible if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are both valid base 4 digits without borrowing. \n\n3. **Consider Borrowing Possibilities**:\n   - If borrowing occurs, the equation might change: it's possible \\(B - A = 3\\) because \\(B\\) had to borrow from the higher place value.\n\n### Rechecking with Borrowing\n\nLet\u2019s inspect the scenario assuming borrowing occurred:\n\n- **Considering Borrowing Effects**:\n  - Borrowing implies that from the leftmost column, \\(A-1 - B = 0\\), suggesting \\(A = B + 1\\).\n\n### Confirms Through Verification:\n\n1. **Verification by Substitution**:\n   - If \\(A = B + 1\\), substitute:\n     \\[\n     B - A = B - (B + 1) = -1\n     \\]\n   - In base 4, borrowing across columns makes \\(B - A = 3\\) valid through transition from \\((B + 1) - 1 = B\\) to align the subtraction correctly.\n\n2. **Analyze Range of Values**:\n   - With \\(A = B + 1\\), this works for \\(A = 2, B = 1\\) or \\(A = 3, B = 2\\).\n\n### Reflect and Validate:\n\nBy confirming through alternative configurations:\n- \\(A = 3\\) and \\(B = 2\\) leads to:\n  - \\(3 - 2 = 1\\) from \\(A - B = 1\\), which aligns properly without misalignment using valid digit ranges.\n\nUltimately, \\(B\\) requiring borrowing transforms the initial assumption, and aligning the analysis confirms:\n\n- The nonnegative difference of digits \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is therefore \\(|A - B| = 1\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis corrected approach confirms that the nonnegative difference is \\(|A - B| = 1\\), achieved by acknowledging potential borrowing effects in base 4 subtraction. This matches configurations for which subtraction respects conditions without error, rendering the problem consistent under revised evaluation.",

  "ground_truth": "In the subtraction problem, we can start by looking at the left column. The first possible case is that $A-B=0$, so that $A=B$. However, if $A=B$, that does not work in the right column, since $B-A$ would equal 0 and not 3. So, we have to go with the second possibility for the left column, in which the right column borrowed from the left column and we're left with $(A-1)-B=0$. This tells us that $A-1=B$, so the nonnegative difference of $A$ and $B$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nNote that we are unable to solve for the actual digits $A$ and $B$ even if we consider the units digit. Now that we know the right column borrows from the left column, we get that $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & & 1 & B_4\\\\ &- & & & & A_4\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & & & & 3_4.\\\\ \\end{array} $$This also means $A+3=1B_4=4+B$, which is the same as $A-1=B$. We can't solve for $A$ and $B$ because any digits that satisfy $A-1=B$ will work, such as $A=3, B=2$ or $A=2, B=1$."
