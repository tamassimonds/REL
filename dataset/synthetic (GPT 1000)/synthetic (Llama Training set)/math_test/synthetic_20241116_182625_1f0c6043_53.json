    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're tasked with rewriting the equation \\(x^2 + 18x - 9 = 0\\) by completing the square and finding the value of \\(c\\) in the form \\((x + b)^2 = c\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nFirst, I'm thinking about the process of completing the square. This generally involves creating a perfect square trinomial from the quadratic expression on the left-hand side. I've definitely done this before, so I feel relatively confident about the steps I need to take.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **Move the Constant to the Other Side:**\n\n   To make it easier to focus only on the x terms for now, let's start by isolating them:\n\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 18x = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Complete the Square on the \\(x\\) Terms:**\n\n   To complete the square, we need to take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\), square it, and add it to both sides. \n   \n   - The coefficient of \\(x\\) is 18.\n   - Half of 18 is 9.\n   - Squaring 9 gives us 81.\n\n   With this information, I can adjust the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 18x + 81 = 9 + 81\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rewriting as a Perfect Square:**\n\n   Now, the left side is a perfect square:\n\n   \\[\n   (x + 9)^2 = 90\n   \\]\n\n   Reflecting on this, I see how we can rewrite the quadratic in the desired form \\((x + b)^2 = c\\), where \\(b = 9\\) and \\(c = 90\\).\n\n### Approaching the Solution\n\nI've completed the process, and everything seems to align correctly with the steps for completing the square. I did each one logically and double-checked the arithmetic involved, especially with adding and equating both sides correctly.\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's briefly verify:\n\n- By completing the square, we recognized \\((x + 9)^2 = x^2 + 18x + 81\\) matches perfectly with the quadratic equation after adding 81 to both sides.\n- Thus, \\(c = 90\\) seems absolutely right.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter reviewing and reflecting on each step taken:\n\nThe value of \\(c\\) is \\(\\boxed{90}\\).",
