    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive in. Initially, looking at the function \\(\\frac{t(2t-3)}{4t-2} \\le 0\\), I need to ensure I understand what it means for this fraction to be less than or equal to zero. This implies either the numerator is zero or the expression is negative.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Key Features of the Expression\nFirst thoughts... This inequality reminds me of something I learned about sign changes in rational functions. I need to identify where the numerator and denominator are zero because these points can define intervals where the inequality changes its sign.\n\n- **Numerator**: \\(t(2t-3) = 0\\), gives solutions \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\n- **Denominator**: \\(4t-2 = 0\\), gives a solution \\(t = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Critical Points and Test Intervals\nThese points \\(t = 0\\), \\(t = \\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(t = \\frac{3}{2}\\) divide the real number line into intervals. I should test these intervals to see where the overall expression is less than or equal to zero.\n\nThe intervals are:\n1. \\((-\\infty, 0)\\)\n2. \\((0, \\frac{1}{2})\\)\n3. \\((\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2})\\)\n4. \\((\\frac{3}{2}, \\infty)\\)\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Interval\nLet's test a point from each interval to observe the sign of the expression.\n\n1. **Interval \\((-\\infty, 0)\\):** Choose \\(t = -1\\).\n   - Numerator: \\(-1 \\cdot (2 \\cdot -1 - 3) = -1 \\cdot (-5) = 5\\)\n   - Denominator: \\(4 \\cdot -1 - 2 = -6\\)\n   - Expression: \\(\\frac{5}{-6} < 0\\) (Negative)\n\n2. **Interval \\((0, \\frac{1}{2})\\):** Choose \\(t = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n   - Numerator: \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot (2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} - 3) = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot (-\\frac{5}{2}) = -\\frac{5}{8}\\)\n   - Denominator: \\(4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} - 2 = -1\\)\n   - Expression: \\(\\frac{-\\frac{5}{8}}{-1} = \\frac{5}{8}\\) (Positive)\n\n3. **Interval \\((\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2})\\):** Choose \\(t = 1\\).\n   - Numerator: \\(1 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 1 - 3) = 1 \\cdot (-1) = -1\\)\n   - Denominator: \\(4 \\cdot 1 - 2 = 2\\)\n   - Expression: \\(\\frac{-1}{2} < 0\\) (Negative)\n\n4. **Interval \\((\\frac{3}{2}, \\infty)\\):** Choose \\(t = 2\\).\n   - Numerator: \\(2 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 2 - 3) = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2\\)\n   - Denominator: \\(4 \\cdot 2 - 2 = 6\\)\n   - Expression: \\(\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) (Positive)\n\n### Step 4: Construct the Solution\nNow, piecing everything together and taking into account \\(\\leq 0\\):\n\n- In \\((-\\infty, 0)\\), the expression is negative.\n- At \\(t = 0\\), the numerator is zero, so it satisfies \\(\\leq 0\\).\n- In \\((0, \\frac{1}{2})\\), the expression is positive.\n- At \\(t = \\frac{1}{2}\\), the expression is undefined since the denominator is zero.\n- In \\((\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2})\\), the expression is negative.\n- At \\(t = \\frac{3}{2}\\), the numerator is zero, so it satisfies \\(\\leq 0\\).\n- In \\((\\frac{3}{2}, \\infty)\\), the expression is positive.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the set of real values of \\(t\\) for which the inequality \\(\\frac{t(2t-3)}{4t-2} \\le 0\\) is satisfied includes:\n\\[\n(-\\infty, 0] \\cup \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}\\right]\n\\]\n\nThis seems correct based on my checks with intervals and consideration of zeros and undefined points. Feels good to have this logically consistent solution!",

  "ground_truth": "Let $f(t) = t(2t-3)/(4t-2).$ We make a sign table for each of the three factors on the left-hand side:\n\\begin{tabular}{c|ccc|c} &$t$ &$2t-3$ &$4t-2$ &$f(t)$ \\\\ \\hline$t<0$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$0<t<\\frac{1}{2}$ &$+$&$-$&$-$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]$\\frac{1}{2}<t<\\frac{3}{2}$ &$+$&$-$&$+$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$t>\\frac{3}{2}$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]\\end{tabular}Therefore, we have $f(t) < 0$ when $t < 0$ or $\\tfrac12 < t < \\tfrac32.$ Because the inequality is non-strict, we must also include the values of $t$ for which $f(t) = 0,$ which are $t=0$ and $t =\\tfrac32.$ Putting all this together, we get that the set of solutions for $t$ is $\\boxed{(-\\infty, 0] \\cup (\\tfrac12, \\tfrac32]}.$"
