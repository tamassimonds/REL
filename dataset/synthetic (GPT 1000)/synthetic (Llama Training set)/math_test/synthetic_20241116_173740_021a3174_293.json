    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I want to take it step-by-step and explore different ways to tackle it. I'll approach it as naturally as possible, like how I'd do it in real life if I was trying to figure it out on paper.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n- First, I want to make sure I know what's being asked. \n- There's me and my brother. My brother is currently 4 times as old as I am.\n- In six years, he'll be twice as old as I will be then.\n- We need to find out my brother's current age.\n\n### First Thoughts\n- I've seen problems like this before where one person's age is a multiple of another's, and there's usually a way to set up some equations.\n- Immediately, I think about using variables: let's say my age is \\( x \\). Then my brother's age would be \\( 4x \\).\n\n### Setting Up Equations\n1. **Identify the current ages**: \n   - Me: \\( x \\)\n   - Brother: \\( 4x \\)\n\n2. **Think about ages six years from now**:\n   - Me in 6 years: \\( x + 6 \\)\n   - Brother in 6 years: \\( 4x + 6 \\)\n\n3. **Use the information about future ages**:\n   - In six years, my brother's age will be twice my age: \n     \\[\n     4x + 6 = 2(x + 6)\n     \\]\n\n### Solving the Equation\n- Alright, I identified an equation. Let's try to solve it:\n  \\[\n  4x + 6 = 2(x + 6)\n  \\]\n\n- **Expanding the equation**:\n  \\[\n  4x + 6 = 2x + 12\n  \\]\n\n- **Isolating \\( x \\)**:\n  \\[\n  4x - 2x = 12 - 6\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  2x = 6\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x = 3\n  \\]\n\n### Verifying the Answer\n- Now, if \\( x = 3 \\), my current age is 3 years.\n- Brother's current age would be \\( 4x = 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\).\n\n- Double-checking the future scenario:\n  - My age in 6 years: \\( 3 + 6 = 9 \\)\n  - Brother's age in 6 years: \\( 12 + 6 = 18 \\)\n  - Verify: \\( 18 \\) should be twice \\( 9 \\).\n\n- It checks out because \\( 18 = 2 \\times 9 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n- It seems like everything is consistent with the problem statement. \n- So, my brother is currently 12 years old.\n\n### Reflection\n- This process seemed smooth, leveraging a common algebraic approach effectively. \n- Converting narrative information into mathematical expressions was key here.\n- I validated the solution by plugging numbers back into the context, which reassures me the solution is correct. It's pleasing when things confirm expectations logically like this!\n\nLet me know if this makes sense or if there are any other aspects you want to discuss!",

  "ground_truth": "Suppose I am $y$ years old now.  My brother is 4 times as old as I am, so my brother's age is $4y$. Six years from now, my brother will be $4y+6$ years old and I will be $y+6$ years old. Since my brother will be twice as old as I am at that time, we must have \\[4y+6 = 2(y+6).\\]Expanding the right side gives $4y + 6 = 2y + 12$. Subtracting $2y$ from both sides gives $2y + 6 = 12$, and subtracting 6 from both sides gives $2y = 6$.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives $y = 3$.  The question asks for the age of my brother now, which is $4y = \\boxed{12}$.  (Always make sure you answer the question.)"
