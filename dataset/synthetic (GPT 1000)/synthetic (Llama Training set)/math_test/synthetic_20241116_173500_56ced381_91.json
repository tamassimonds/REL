    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. It asks us to determine how many of the given numbers are either factors of 34 or multiples of 7. This means I need to understand both concepts clearly: factors and multiples.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Terms\n- **Factors of 34**: A factor is a number that divides another number without leaving a remainder. So, for any number to be a factor of 34, when 34 is divided by that number, the remainder should be zero.\n- **Multiples of 7**: A multiple is the result of multiplying a number by an integer. So, multiples of 7 are numbers like 7, 14, 21, 28, etc.\n\n### Step 2: List the Factors of 34\n34 is a relatively small number, so let's list its factors:\n- \\(34 = 1 \\times 34\\)\n- \\(34 = 2 \\times 17\\)\nThis means 1, 2, 17, and 34 are all factors of 34.\n\n### Step 3: List the Multiples of 7 within a Reasonable Range\nWe should be trying to think of multiples of 7 that might be in our list:\n- \\(7 \\times 1 = 7\\)\n- \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\)\n- \\(7 \\times 3 = 21\\)\n- \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\)\n- \\(7 \\times 5 = 35\\)\n- \\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\)\n- And so on up to a reasonable number, noting that our list only goes up to 91\n- \\(7 \\times 8 = 56\\)\n- \\(7 \\times 13 = 91\\)\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the List of Numbers\nGiven numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 14, 17, 29, 56, 91\n\n#### Check for Factors of 34:\n- **1**: Is it a factor of 34? Yes.\n- **2**: Is it a factor of 34? Yes.\n- **3**: Is it a factor of 34? No.\n- **4**: Is it a factor of 34? No.\n- **8**: Is it a factor of 34? No.\n- **14**: Is it a factor of 34? No.\n- **17**: Is it a factor of 34? Yes.\n- **29**: Is it a factor of 34? No.\n- **56**: Is it a factor of 34? No.\n- **91**: Is it a factor of 34? No.\n\n#### Check for Multiples of 7:\n- **1**: Is it a multiple of 7? No.\n- **2**: Is it a multiple of 7? No.\n- **3**: Is it a multiple of 7? No.\n- **4**: Is it a multiple of 7? No.\n- **8**: Is it a multiple of 7? No.\n- **14**: Is it a multiple of 7? Yes.\n- **17**: Is it a multiple of 7? No.\n- **29**: Is it a multiple of 7? No.\n- **56**: Is it a multiple of 7? Yes.\n- **91**: Is it a multiple of 7? Yes.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Qualifying Numbers\n- Factors of 34: 1, 2, 17\n- Multiples of 7: 14, 56, 91\n\nCombine the two sets: {1, 2, 17, 14, 56, 91}\n\n### Step 6: Ensure No Overlaps and Accuracy\nThere are no duplicates between the two sets, so we can simply count them: 6 numbers qualify.\n\n### Step 7: Final Check\nI should double-check my results:\n- I found factors of 34: correct\n- I computed multiples of 7: correct\n\nThere we have it. The final answer is 6 numbers from the list are either factors of 34 or multiples of 7.",

  "ground_truth": "We can check each number one by one.\n\n1: 1 is a factor of 34 since $1\\cdot34=34$ .\n\n2: 2 is a factor of 34 since $2\\cdot17=34$ .\n\n3: 3 is not a factor of 34 since there is no number that can be multiplied by 3 to get 34. ( $34\\div3$ gives a quotient of 11 and a  remainder of 1.) There is also no number that can be multiplied by 7 to get 3 ( $3\\div7$ gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder 3.)\n\n4: 4 is not a factor of 34 since there is no number that can be multiplied by 4 to get 34.  ($34 \\div 4$ gives a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 2.)  There is also no number that can be multiplied by 7 to get 4.  ($4 \\div 7$ gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 4.)\n\n8:  8 is not a factor of 34 since there is no number that can multiply it to get 34 ( $34\\div8$ gives a quotient of 4 and a  remainder of 2) and is not a multiple of 7 since there is no number that can multiply 7 to get 8 ( $8\\div7$ gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder 1).\n\n14: 14 is a multiple of 7 since $7\\cdot2=14$ .\n\n17: 17 is a factor of 34 since $17\\cdot2=34$ .\n\n29: 29 is not a factor of 34, since there is no number that can multiply it to get 34 ( $34\\div29$ gives a quotient of 1 and a  remainder of 5) and is not a multiple of 7 since there is no number that can multiply 7 to get 29 ( $29\\div7$ gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder 1).\n\n56: 56 is a multiple of 7 since $7\\cdot8=56$ .\n\n91: 91 is a multiple of 7 since $7\\cdot13=91$ .\n\nSo, $\\boxed{6}$ of the 10 numbers are factors of 34 or multiples of 7."
