    "working_out": "Alright, let's explore the problem together step-by-step. The equation given is \\(\\cos x + \\cos 2x + \\cos 3x = 3\\). We need to find the expression \\(\\sin x + \\sin 2x + \\sin 3x\\).\n\n**First Thoughts and Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation:** When I see a trigonometric equation like \\(\\cos x + \\cos 2x + \\cos 3x = 3\\), my mind immediately thinks about the properties of cosine. The maximum value for each cosine term is 1, therefore, this equation reaches its maximum (\\(\\cos x = \\cos 2x = \\cos 3x = 1\\)) when all angles correspond to the same direction (on the unit circle).\n\n2. **Basic Observations:** Since each cosine function can be at most 1, the condition \\(\\cos x + \\cos 2x + \\cos 3x = 3\\) suggests that \\(\\cos x = 1\\), \\(\\cos 2x = 1\\), and \\(\\cos 3x = 1\\).\n\n3. **Understanding Cosine Equals One:** The equation \\(\\cos \\theta = 1\\) is satisfied for angles \\( \\theta = 2k\\pi\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer. So, we have:\n   - \\(\\cos x = 1 \\Rightarrow x = 2m\\pi\\) for some integer \\(m\\).\n   - \\(\\cos 2x = 1 \\Rightarrow 2x = 2n\\pi \\Rightarrow x = n\\pi\\).\n   - \\(\\cos 3x = 1 \\Rightarrow 3x = 2p\\pi \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{2p}{3}\\pi\\).\n\n4. **Reconciling Values:** For these to all be true simultaneously, \\(x\\) must satisfy all these conditions simultaneously. By matching these conditions, we look for a common value:\n   - From \\(x = m\\pi\\), and \\(x = \\frac{2p}{3}\\pi\\), we need integer solutions that satisfy both conditions.\n   - It's evident that \\(x = 0\\) is a straightforward solution as all conditions converge to satisfy cosine equal to 1 at 0.\n\n5. **Sinusoidal Component Check:** Now, substituting \\(x = 0\\), we have:\n   - \\(\\sin(0) + \\sin(0) + \\sin(0) = 0\\).\n\n**Verification and Reflection:**\n\n6. **Check Back:** The chosen values of \\(x\\) should be re-checked to ensure the assumptions are valid. Here, each of \\(\\cos x\\), \\(\\cos 2x\\), and \\(\\cos 3x\\) equating to 1 makes the equation valid.\n\n7. **Consider Other Solutions:** Keep in mind the periodic nature of cosine and sine, usually exploring modulo \\(2\\pi\\). Since every other \\(x\\) must satisfy \\( \\frac{3x}{2\\pi} \\) as an integer multiple for a more general solution, \\(x = 0\\) remains the primary feasible elementary solution within the first primitive cycle.\n\n**Final Solution:**\n\nFrom the considerations above, the sine sum evaluates as:\n\\[\n\\sin x + \\sin 2x + \\sin 3x = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated sum of \\(\\sin x + \\sin 2x + \\sin 3x\\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\), which matches logically and algebraically with typical sinusoidal transformations under the given cosine condition.",

  "ground_truth": "Remember that $\\cos \\theta \\le 1$ for all angles $\\theta.$  So, the only way that the equation\n\\[\\cos x + \\cos 2x + \\cos 3x = 3\\]can holds is if $\\cos x = \\cos 2x = \\cos 3x = 1.$  In such a case,\n\\[\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x = 0,\\]so $\\sin x = 0,$ which means $x$ is a multiple of $\\pi.$  Therefore, $\\sin x + \\sin 2x + \\sin 3x = \\boxed{0}.$  (Note that we can take $x = 0.$)"
