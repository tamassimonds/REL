    "working_out": "Let's dive into this problem. When I first see it, what jumps out is that it's about finding the other endpoint of a line segment, given one endpoint and the midpoint. This definitely feels like something I've done before in algebra or geometry classes. It's about using the properties of midpoints, but let's see if I can recall the specifics and check if my initial approach is sensible.\n\nAlright, let's set out a few possible ways to think about this:\n\n1. **Use the midpoint formula directly:** \n   The midpoint \\( M \\) of a line segment with endpoints \\( A(x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( B(x_2, y_2) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   M = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right)\n   \\]\n   For our problem, we know \\( M = (3, -2) \\) and \\( A = (1, 6) \\). We need to find \\( B(x_2, y_2) \\).\n\n2. **Substitute known values and solve:**\n   Plug in the values into the midpoint formula:\n\n    \\[\n    3 = \\frac{1 + x_2}{2}\n    \\]\n\n    \\[\n    -2 = \\frac{6 + y_2}{2}\n    \\]\n   \n    These two separate equations can help find \\( x_2 \\) and \\( y_2 \\).\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x_2 \\):**\n   Let's look at the first equation:\n\n   - Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 3 = 1 + x_2 \\implies 6 = 1 + x_2\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 1 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     x_2 = 6 - 1 \\implies x_2 = 5\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( y_2 \\):**\n   Now, let's handle the second equation:\n\n   - Multiply both sides by 2:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times (-2) = 6 + y_2 \\implies -4 = 6 + y_2\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 6 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     y_2 = -4 - 6 \\implies y_2 = -10\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   With \\( x_2 = 5 \\) and \\( y_2 = -10 \\), let's quickly check:\n  \n   - Substitute \\( x_2 \\) back into the original \\( x \\)-coordinate equation to double-check:\n     \\[\n     3 = \\frac{1 + 5}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n     \\]\n     That's correct!\n\n   - Do the same for the \\( y \\)-coordinate:\n     \\[\n     -2 = \\frac{6 + (-10)}{2} = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2\n     \\]\n     That works too!\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe calculations confirm that the other endpoint \\( B \\) is \\( (5, -10) \\). This solution seems consistent and, most importantly, satisfies the conditions given in the problem. I started by considering the general approach to find the midpoint, substituted given values to form equations for missing variables, and solved step-by-step. A check of the result reassures me it's correct.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the other endpoint be $(x, y)$. We know that $\\frac{1 + x}{2} = 3$, so $x = 5$. We also know that $\\frac{6 + y}{2} = -2$, so $y = -10$. Therefore, the other endpoint is $\\boxed{(5, -10)}$."
