    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. The question asks us to find the magnitude of the product of two complex numbers, given that \\( |a| = 7 \\) and \\( |b| = 4 \\). Here's how I'm thinking about it:\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\nWhen I first look at this, I immediately think about the properties of absolute values in the context of complex numbers. There's a property that states \\( |ab| = |a| \\cdot |b| \\) for any complex numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). So, it looks like this problem might be more straightforward than it seems. But let\u2019s break things down step-by-step to be sure we\u2019re on the right track.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Absolute Value in Complex Numbers\nIn complex numbers, the absolute value \\( |z| \\) of a complex number \\( z = x + yi \\) is given by \\( |z| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). This represents the distance of the number \\( z \\) from the origin on the complex plane.\n\n### Step 2: Considering the Product of Complex Numbers\nFor the product of two complex numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the formula \\( |ab| = |a| \\cdot |b| \\) is a key property. This property simplifies our work quite a bit.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Property\nSince the property seems applicable here, let's apply it directly:\nGiven \\( |a| = 7 \\) and \\( |b| = 4 \\), then \\( |ab| = |a| \\cdot |b| = 7 \\cdot 4 = 28 \\).\n\n### Quick Check:\n- The property we used is foundational for complex numbers, so it should hold true.\n- There's no need to assume specific forms for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) because the given magnitudes \\( |a| \\) and \\( |b| \\) are sufficient due to the property.\n\n### Final Reflection:\nThis approach feels correct because it utilizes a direct and well-known property of complex numbers. There's no need to doubt this result as it aligns perfectly with the mathematical rules governing complex number operations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe magnitude of the product \\( |ab| \\) is \\( 28 \\). It\u2019s reassuring to see that using properties can simplify the process to find the solution efficiently.\n\nI\u2019m happy with this answer and confident in the process I used. If any assumptions or steps felt wrong in practice, revisiting the properties we're using would be a good starting point. But everything makes sense here!",
