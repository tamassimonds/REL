    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\nFirst Thoughts:  \nWhen I first read the problem, I'm thinking, \"I've seen something like this before where we count specific numbers based on conditions.\" The concept is about combinations, and it's about ensuring at least one of a certain type. The problem has to do with digits, specifically 5-digit numbers, which means calculations involve powers of 10 a lot. The question asks for numbers that have at least one 2 or 3, which feels like it could involve some form of complementary counting.\n\nStrategy Exploration:  \nOne approach is to directly count the numbers satisfying the condition (i.e., containing at least one 2 or one 3), but that involves checking all such numbers, which could be cumbersome. An alternative strategy could be using complementary counting, where we instead count numbers that don't meet the condition (i.e., having no 2s or 3s) and then subtract from the total number.\n\nApproach:  \nUsing complementary counting appears suitable here. Let's proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate Total 5-digit Numbers:**\n   - The smallest 5-digit number is 10000 and the largest is 99999.\n   - There are \\(99999 - 10000 + 1 = 90000\\) total 5-digit numbers. Seems straightforward, let's move ahead.\n\n2. **Calculate 5-digit Numbers with No 2s or 3s:**\n   - Here, each digit must be something other than 2 or 3. The digits 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are allowable.\n   - There are 8 options per digit.\n   - For the first (most significant) digit, it can\u2019t be 0 (since we're dealing with 5-digit numbers), leaving 7 choices: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - Let's calculate the total:  \n     - For the first digit: 7 options  \n     - For the remaining 4 digits: 8 options each\n     \\[\n     7 \\times 8^4\n     \\]\n\n3. **Compute \\(8^4\\):**\n\n   - \\(8 \\times 8 = 64\\)  \n   - \\(64 \\times 8 = 512\\)  \n   - \\(512 \\times 8 = 4096\\)  \n   - So, \\(8^4 = 4096\\)\n\n4. **Calculate 5-digit Numbers with No 2s or 3s:**\n\n   - Now, calculate the total:\n     \\[\n     7 \\times 4096 = 28672\n     \\]\n\n5. **Use Complementary Counting:**\n\n   - Numbers with at least one 2 or 3:  \n   \\[\n   90000 - 28672 = 61328\n   \\]\n\nDeep Reflection on Result: \nLet me think about whether this approach makes sense. Complementary counting seems correct where I considered only valid digits and excluded undesired options. The steps involve combinations and directly counted what was easy to enumerate (numbers with no 2s or 3s) and subtracted from the total. The calculations check out logically, and the arithmetic for powers and totals is verified step-by-step.\n\nSo, the final answer is **61,328**. That\u2019s the number of 5-digit numbers that have at least one 2 or one 3 among their digits.",

  "ground_truth": "A 5-digit number can have for its leftmost digit anything from 1 to 9 inclusive, and for each of its next four digits anything from 0 through 9 inclusive. Thus there are $9\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10\\times 10=90,\\!000$ 5-digit numbers.\n\nA 5-digit number with no 2 or 3 as a digit can have for its first digit 1 or anything from 4 through 9, and can have for each other digit any of those numbers or 0.\n\nThere are $7 \\times 8\\times 8\\times 8\\times 8=28,\\!672$ such 5-digit numbers. Therefore the number of 5-digit numbers with at least one 2 or one 3 as a digit is  $90,\\!000-28,\\!672=\\boxed{61,328}.$"
