    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together. We're tasked with solving the equation \\(5(x+3) = 55\\) for \\(x\\). Let's break this down step by step and see where our thoughts take us.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nFirst thoughts: This looks like a basic linear equation. I remember solving similar ones where the idea is to isolate the variable \\(x\\). Generally, it's about reversing the operations applied to \\(x\\). But let me make sure that I'm seeing all the pieces clearly before diving into solving it.\n\n### Step 2: Consider Different Strategies\nOkay, so typically:\n- I could expand the left side and then proceed with simplifying the equation.\n- Alternatively, I could divide both sides by the coefficient of the parenthesis first.\n\nLet's reflect on these techniques:\n1. Expanding seems straightforward. Would it make the equation simpler?\n2. Dividing by 5 first might quickly give us a simpler equation. Could that be more efficient here? Let\u2019s give both a quick review.\n\n### Step 3: Try a Method\nI\u2019ll start with expanding first since that's what's coming to mind initially.\n\n- **Expanding Method**\n  \\[\n  5(x + 3) = 55\n  \\]\n  When I expand, it becomes:\n  \\[\n  5x + 15 = 55\n  \\]\n\n  Now, to isolate \\(x\\), I need to get rid of 15 on the left side by subtracting 15 from both sides:\n  \\[\n  5x + 15 - 15 = 55 - 15\n  \\]\n  Simplifying gives:\n  \\[\n  5x = 40\n  \\]\n  Next, divide both sides by 5 to solve for \\(x\\):\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{40}{5}\n  \\]\n  Which simplifies to:\n  \\[\n  x = 8\n  \\]\n\nLet\u2019s quickly check if dividing first works too, just to see if it\u2019s easier:\n\n- **Dividing First Method**\n  Original equation:\n  \\[\n  5(x + 3) = 55\n  \\]\n\n  Divide both sides by 5:\n  \\[\n  x + 3 = \\frac{55}{5}\n  \\]\n\n  Simplifies to:\n  \\[\n  x + 3 = 11\n  \\]\n\n  Subtract 3 from both sides to solve for \\(x\\):\n  \\[\n  x = 11 - 3\n  \\]\n  Simplifies to:\n  \\[\n  x = 8\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Reflect and Verify\nBoth methods landed us at the same solution, \\(x = 8\\). It feels satisfying when different methods align in their results. \n\nLet me double-check by substituting \\(x = 8\\) back into the original equation to ensure it holds true:\n\\[\n5(x + 3) = 5(8 + 3) = 5 \\times 11 = 55\n\\]\n\nThe initial condition of the equation is satisfied perfectly. So, everything checks out!\n\n### Conclusion\nThe solution to the equation is \\(x = 8\\). Both methods led to the correct result. Starting with either expanding or dividing first works here\u2014division was a bit quicker, which I might prefer next time. Reflecting the process reassured me that both approaches achieve the right outcome. It\u2019s all about handling these operations step by step, checking through, and ensuring the approach feels right.",
