    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. It asks for the sum of the smallest and second-smallest positive integers \\(a\\) that satisfy the congruence:\n\n\\[ 27a \\equiv 17 \\pmod{40} \\]\n\nFirst, let me break down what this means. We are looking for integers \\(a\\) such that when \\(27a\\) is divided by 40, the remainder is 17. My first thought is that this is a typical example of solving a linear congruence, which seems familiar from number theory problems I've tackled before.\n\n### Step 1: Understand and Restate the Problem\n\nThe problem boils down to finding integers \\(a\\) which satisfy this specific modular arithmetic relation. I think the goal is to find two such integers \\(a\\) (the smallest and the second smallest), and then add them together.\n\n### Step 2: Strategy Brainstorm\n\nThere are a few potential methods for finding \\(a\\):\n\n1. **Trial and Error:**\n   - Plug in successive integer values for \\(a\\) and check if the congruence holds.\n  \n2. **Systematic Search:**\n   - Consider rearranging and solving the congruence generally and systematically through the use of known methods, such as the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n3. **Inverse Method:**\n   - Find the multiplicative inverse of 27 modulo 40 (if it exists) to directly solve for \\(a\\).\n\nThe congruence ring has modulus 40, which isn't huge, so trial and error could be feasible, but the inverse method might be more elegant.\n\n### Step 3: Check Feasibility of the Inverse Method\n\nLet's see if 27 has an inverse modulo 40. This is true if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 27 and 40 is 1. Let me quickly calculate this:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(27, 40) = 1\n\\]\n\nYes, they are coprime, so an inverse exists. I'll use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find this inverse.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Inverse Using Extended Euclidean Algorithm\n\nIf \\( 27x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{40} \\), then \\(x\\) is the inverse of 27 modulo 40.\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n1. \\(40 = 27 \\times 1 + 13\\)\n2. \\(27 = 13 \\times 2 + 1\\)\n3. \\(13 = 1 \\times 13 + 0\\)\n\nBack-substitution gives:\n\n1. \\(1 = 27 - 13 \\times 2\\)\n2. \\(13 = 40 - 27 \\times 1\\)\n\nSubstitute 13:\n\n\\(1 = 27 - (40 - 27) \\times 2\\)\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n\\(1 = 27 \\times 3 - 40 \\times 2\\)\n\nThus, the inverse of 27 modulo 40 is 3. This tells me:\n\n\\[ 27 \\times 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{40} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\(a\\)\n\nNow, multiply the original congruence by 3 (the inverse) to solve for \\(a\\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 27a \\equiv 3 \\times 17 \\pmod{40} \\]\n\n\\[ a \\equiv 51 \\pmod{40} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ a \\equiv 11 \\pmod{40} \\]\n\n### Step 6: Find Smallest and Second Smallest Solutions\n\nThe smallest positive \\(a\\) is when \\(a = 11\\).\n\nFor the second smallest, I'll need to add the modulus 40 to find the next solution:\n\nSecond smallest \\(a\\): \\(11 + 40 = 51\\)\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Sum of Solutions\n\nSum of the smallest and second smallest \\(a\\):\n\n\\[ 11 + 51 = 62 \\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nThis solution seems to check out, as each step logically followed from the conditions of the original congruence. Given the relation, and the discovery of the multiplicative inverse, I feel confident that these are the two smallest positive solutions. The calculated sum, 62, resonates with the procedural integrity of the steps followed.\n\nThus, the sum of the smallest and second smallest positive integers \\(a\\) satisfying the congruence is \\(\\boxed{62}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Note that $27$ and $40$ are relatively prime, so $27$ has an inverse $\\pmod{40}$. Conveniently, the inverse of $27\\pmod{40}$ is easily found to be $3$, as we have $27\\cdot 3 = 81\\equiv 1\\pmod{40}$.\n\nTo solve the congruence $27a\\equiv 17\\pmod{40}$, we multiply both sides by $3$ and simplify: \\begin{align*}\n3\\cdot 27a &\\equiv 3\\cdot 17 \\pmod{40} \\\\\na &\\equiv 51 \\pmod{40} \\\\\na &\\equiv 11 \\pmod{40}\n\\end{align*}Each operation in this sequence is reversible, so the solution set is exactly the set of integers congruent to $11\\pmod{40}$. The smallest and second-smallest positive solutions are $11$ and $51$. Their sum is $\\boxed{62}$."
