    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into calculating \\(\\tan 240^\\circ\\) step by step. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst, let's understand what \\(\\tan 240^\\circ\\) means. It's a trigonometric function evaluated at an angle measured in degrees. The tangent function represents the ratio of the sine to the cosine of an angle. \n\n### Step 2: Determine the Quadrant\nBefore starting calculations, it's important to identify which quadrant \\(240^\\circ\\) falls into. Starting from 0\u00b0:\n\n- Quadrant I: \\(0^\\circ\\) to \\(90^\\circ\\)\n- Quadrant II: \\(90^\\circ\\) to \\(180^\\circ\\)\n- Quadrant III: \\(180^\\circ\\) to \\(270^\\circ\\)\n- Quadrant IV: \\(270^\\circ\\) to \\(360^\\circ\\)\n\nSince \\(240^\\circ\\) is between \\(180^\\circ\\) and \\(270^\\circ\\), it falls in Quadrant III.\n\n### Step 3: Sign of the Tangent\nIn Quadrant III, both sine and cosine are negative, but since tangent is sine divided by cosine, the negatives cancel out, leaving the tangent positive.\n\n### Step 4: Reference Angle\nThe reference angle is the smallest angle the terminal side of \\(240^\\circ\\) makes with the x-axis. To find it, we can subtract \\(180^\\circ\\) from \\(240^\\circ\\):\n\n\\[ \\text{Reference angle} = 240^\\circ - 180^\\circ = 60^\\circ \\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Tangent of the Reference Angle\nWe know from trigonometric identities that:\n\\[ \\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\n### Step 6: Apply the Sign from the Quadrant\nSince \\(\\tan 240^\\circ\\) is in the third quadrant where tangent is positive, we maintain the positive value:\n\n\\[ \\tan 240^\\circ = \\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\n### Step 7: Review the Steps and Final Answer\nI should double-check that I've considered the sign correctly based on the quadrant. Quadrant III is indeed where both sine and cosine are negative, but tangent ends up positive, supporting my final answer.\n\nTherefore:\n\\[ \\tan 240^\\circ = \\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nThis looks right! Everything checks out logically. The calculations align with standard trigonometric values, and the quadrant approach confirms the sign.",
