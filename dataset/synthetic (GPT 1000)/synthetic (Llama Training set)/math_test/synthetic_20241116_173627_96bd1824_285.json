    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- I'm given that \\(2a - 3b = -23\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are consecutive integers. This reminds me of problems where we have a system of equations or linear expressions but with an added constraint that helps narrow down possibilities.\n- The fact that \\(a < b\\) is useful too; since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are consecutive, this means \\(b = a + 1\\).\n  \n**Brainstorming Solutions:**\n\n- My first inclination is to substitute \\(b = a + 1\\) into the equation \\(2a - 3b = -23\\). This often simplifies things if you're dealing with a single equation and a relationship like being consecutive integers.\n- I could try other arithmetic or algebraic strategies, like solving the equation with different assumptions, but let's start with substitution as it's typically straightforward.\n\n**Applying Substitution:**\n\n1. Substitute \\(b = a + 1\\) into the equation \\(2a - 3b = -23\\):\n   \\[\n   2a - 3(a + 1) = -23\n   \\]\n\n2. Expand and simplify:\n   \\[\n   2a - 3a - 3 = -23\n   \\]\n\n3. Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   -a - 3 = -23\n   \\]\n\n4. Add 3 to both sides to isolate the term with \\(a\\):\n   \\[\n   -a = -20\n   \\]\n\n5. Multiply both sides by -1 to solve for \\(a\\):\n   \\[\n   a = 20\n   \\]\n\n**Reflecting and Checking:**\n\n- Okay, I\u2019ve found \\(a = 20\\). I need to check if this works with \\(b = a + 1 = 21\\).\n- Substitute back into the original equation to verify:\n  \\[\n  2(20) - 3(21) = -23\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  40 - 63 = -23\n  \\]\n\n- Perfect, the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that our solution \\(a = 20\\) is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The calculations and logic hold up, and substituting \\(b = a + 1\\) right away was a strong initial move since it quickly led to the solution.\n- My approach was correct, and there\u2019s no need for a different strategy since this efficiently solved the problem.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(a\\) is \\(\\boxed{20}\\). \n\nGiven how smooth this went, I'd say I feel confident in this solution, and nothing seems out of place.",
