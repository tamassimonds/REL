    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem! \n\n### Initial Thoughts:\nWhen I first see the expression \\(\\prod_{k = 0}^\\infty \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{14^{2^k}} \\right)\\), I'm reminded of infinite products. I've seen similar forms in series and products before, particularly involving exponentials and fractions. My gut tells me this might be related to something like a geometric series, but I need more exploration. Let's break it down and see if we can find a pattern or simplification.\n\n### Strategy Exploration:\n1. **Recognize the form**: We are dealing with an infinite product here. These can sometimes be tricky due to their convergence properties, so I'll need to think about whether this product converges and, if so, to what.\n\n2. **Consider geometric interpretation**: The infinite product form reminds me of something that might telescope or simplify dramatically if each term aligns just right. I haven't got a clear idea just yet, so I'll note that and come back if needed.\n\n3. **Logarithmic Approach**: Sometimes, products simplify when you take logarithms because they turn products into sums, which are often easier to handle. However, this requires the product to converge, so I have to be careful with divergence issues.\n\n4. **Known results**: Is there a known result or identity that uses this form? I should check if there's a connection to any known product formulas involving exponential terms or powers.\n\n5. **Convergence**: A quick thought is needed on whether this product converges. As \\(k \\to \\infty\\), \\( \\frac{1}{14^{2^k}} \\) becomes very small, suggesting that each term \\(1 + \\frac{1}{14^{2^k}}\\) is close to 1, which bodes well for convergence, but let's verify this properly.\n\n### Calculations and Breakdown:\n#### Step 1: Simplification\nFor each \\(k\\), the term inside is \\(1 + \\frac{1}{14^{2^k}}\\). \n\n#### Step 2: Logarithmic Test\nChecking convergence via logarithms:\n- \\(\\ln{\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{14^{2^k}}\\right)}\\) can be expanded using the Taylor series as \\(\\frac{1}{14^{2^k}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{14^{2^k}}\\right)^2 + \\cdots\\).\n\nThis means that we are essentially looking at:\n\\[ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{14^{2^k}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{14^{2^{2k}}} + \\ldots \\right)\\]\n\n#### Step 3: Convergence Check\nThe series \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{14^{2^k}} \\) converges because it is a geometric series with a common ratio of \\(\\frac{1}{14}\\), which is less than 1.\n\n#### Step 4: Known Result Insight\nReflecting on what this resembles, I recall an interesting property of infinite products of this form:\n\n\\[ \\prod_{k=0}^\\infty \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{14^{2^k}}\\right) \\]\n\nis actually related to a modification of the binomial theorem known as the Euler product identity.\n\n### Conclusion: Reflecting and Summarizing\nGiven step 3's convergence of the series and a recollection of the Euler product formula wisdom, this specific structure converges to a finite product that often expresses itself as the form \\(\\frac{14}{13}\\). \n\nThus, this product evaluates to a simple closed-form number:\n**The product equals \\(\\frac{14}{13}\\).**\n\nI feel confident about this answer due to the combination of convergence reasoning and recalling properties associated with similar infinite products. If any further verification or a deeper exploration were needed, examining specifics of the Euler product theorem in a detailed context could be beneficial.",
