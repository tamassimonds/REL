    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem. We need to maximize the expression \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2\\) given the constraint \\(a + b + c + d = 1\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) are nonnegative real numbers.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- This reminds me of the power mean inequality and other optimization problems involving sums of squares.\n- Since we're maximizing squares, larger individual values for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), or \\(d\\) tend to dominate. Intuitively, concentrating the \"mass\" into one variable might help.\n- Maybe there's a symmetry or inequality that can simplify the process.\n\n**Initial Strategy Exploration:**\n\n1. **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:** \n   - The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality sometimes helps with optimizing sums. In this context, it feels a bit indirect, but worth noting.\n   \n2. **Lagrange Multipliers:**\n   - A classical approach to constrained optimization is Lagrange multipliers. However, it involves calculus and might get complicated since we have four variables.\n\n3. **Quadratic Expression Behavior:**\n   - Understand the behavior of the quadratic expression. The nature of squared terms suggests concentrating as much value as possible in one term increases the sum.\n\n**Simpler Strategy Consideration:**\n\n- **All Values Equal or One Variable Dominating:** \n   - If we think about \\(a = b = c = d\\), then \\(a = b = c = d = \\frac{1}{4}\\). This gives \\((\\frac{1}{4})^2 \\times 4 = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n   - If we set one variable, say \\(a\\), to 1, and \\(b = c = d = 0\\), then the expression is \\(1^2 = 1\\). This suggests a higher value than \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nWait \u2013 let\u2019s check: Concentrating everything into one variable seems to maximize the value.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The setup of the problem suggests symmetry, but maximizing individual contributions gives a clear result.\n- If one number can be 1 (with others being zero), then \\(a^2 = 1^2 = 1\\). If distributed uniformly, the sum is only \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\nEach squared term contributes maximally when at its peak value while others are zero, confirming our quick check when \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = c = d = 0\\).\n\nHence, the maximum value of \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nThis was a great reminder that sometimes simpler strategies trump complex ones, especially with symmetry and constraints promoting clear outcomes.",

  "ground_truth": "It is clear that $0 \\le a \\le 1,$ so $a(1 - a) \\ge 0.$  Then $a - a^2 \\ge 0,$ or $a^2 \\le a.$  Similarly, $b^2 \\le b,$ $c^2 \\le c,$ and $d^2 \\le d,$ so\n\\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \\le a + b + c + d = 1.\\]Equality occurs when $a = 1$ and $b = c = d = 0,$ so the maximum value is $\\boxed{1}.$"
