    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem. We need to understand what we're trying to achieve here and explore different strategies. Our goal is to find the smallest possible value of \\(\\sqrt{ax}\\) where \\(x = 735\\) and \\(ax\\) is a perfect square.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- **Familiarity with Perfect Squares:** Immediately, I'm thinking about perfect squares and their properties. If \\(ax\\) is a perfect square, then the product of \\(a\\) and \\(x\\) must result in a square number. Maybe I can start by factorizing \\(735\\).\n\n### Step 1: Factorize 735\n\nFirst, let's factorize \\(735\\) to see which prime factors we are working with:\n\n1. **Factor out smallest numbers:** \\(735\\) is odd, so it's not divisible by 2. Let's try 3. \\(735\\) divided by 3 is \\(245\\).\n\n   \\[\n   735 = 3 \\times 245\n   \\]\n\n2. **Factorize 245:** This number ends in 5, so it's divisible by 5. Dividing by 5 gives 49.\n\n   \\[\n   245 = 5 \\times 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Factorize 49:** This is a perfect square, \\(7^2\\).\n\n   \\[\n   49 = 7 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\nCombining these, we have:\n\n\\[\n735 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Make \\(ax\\) a Perfect Square\n\nTo make \\(ax\\) a perfect square, each prime number in its factorization should have an even exponent. Let's see what we need to add:\n\n- **3 has an exponent of 1:** Need another 3.\n- **5 has an exponent of 1:** Need another 5.\n- **7 has an even exponent (2):** No extra needed here.\n\nThis implies we need to multiply \\(735\\) by \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) to make \\(ax\\) a perfect square.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Minimal \\(\\sqrt{ax}\\)\n\nNow, we know that \\(a = 15\\). Let's calculate \\(\\sqrt{ax}\\):\n\n1. **Calculate \\(ax\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   ax = 735 \\times 15\n   \\]\n\n   Calculating it out:\n\n   \\[\n   ax = 735 \\times 15 = 11025\n   \\]\n\n2. **Check if \\(ax\\) is a perfect square:**\n\n   Let's check if 11025 is actually a perfect square by taking the square root:\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{11025} = 105\n   \\]\n\nThe square root is an integer, so \\(11025\\) is indeed a perfect square. This means we've done the factorization and multiplication correctly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of \\(\\sqrt{ax}\\) is \\(105\\). I've reflected on the steps to ensure I wasn't rushing through and missed any vital understanding. Everything logically checks out because we've ensured \\(ax\\) is a perfect square by adjusting for even exponents in its prime factorization. I'm confident the final solution is accurate.",

  "ground_truth": "First we find the prime factorization of 735, which is $3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7^2$. In order to make a perfect square, we need another factor of 3 and another factor of 5. So if $a=15$, we have $ax=(3\\cdot5)(3\\cdot5\\cdot7^2)=3^2\\cdot5^2\\cdot7^2$. That means $\\sqrt{ax}=3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{105}$."
