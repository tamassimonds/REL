    "working_out": "Alright, let's take this problem step by step. \n\n### Initial Understanding\n\nFirst, let's fully understand the problem. We're dealing with four semi-circles and a line segment \\(AD\\) which serves as the diameter for the largest semicircle. The semicircle's radius is thus half of the length of \\(AD\\) as it's the diameter.\n\nThe given ratio \\(AB:BC:CD = 1:2:3\\) means that each segment is proportionally increasing. We need to track these proportions carefully, as they impact the diameters and thus the areas of our semicircles.\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio of the shaded area to the unshaded area within the semi-circle described by diameter \\(AD\\).\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n1. **Determine Lengths of Segments:**\n\n   If \\(AB:BC:CD = 1:2:3\\), let's think of \\(AB = x\\). Then \\(BC = 2x\\) and \\(CD = 3x\\). Therefore, \\(AD = AB + BC + CD = x + 2x + 3x = 6x\\).\n\n2. **Calculate Areas:**\n\n   - The semicircle of \\(AD\\) (largest semicircle):\n     - Radius = \\( \\frac{6x}{2} = 3x\\)\n     - Area = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (3x)^2 = \\frac{9}{2} \\pi x^2 \\)\n\n   - Semicircle of \\(CD\\):\n     - Radius = \\( \\frac{3x}{2} = 1.5x \\)\n     - Area = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (1.5x)^2 = \\frac{9}{8} \\pi x^2 \\)\n\n   - Semicircle of \\(BC\\):\n     - Radius = \\( \\frac{2x}{2} = x \\)\n     - Area = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\pi x^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi x^2 \\)\n\n   - Semicircle of \\(AB\\):\n     - Radius = \\( \\frac{x}{2} = 0.5x \\)\n     - Area = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (0.5x)^2 = \\frac{1}{8} \\pi x^2 \\)\n\n3. **Determine Shaded Area:**\n\n   The shaded area is the area of the largest semicircle minus the combined areas of the three smaller semicircles.\n\n   - Total area of smaller semicircles:\n     - Total = \\(\\frac{9}{8} \\pi x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\pi x^2 + \\frac{1/8} \\pi x^2\\)\n     - Calculate combined area step-by-step:\n       - Convert to common denominator, which is 8:\n       - \\( = \\frac{9}{8} \\pi x^2 + \\frac{4}{8} \\pi x^2 + \\frac{1}{8} \\pi x^2\\)\n       - Simplified = \\(\\frac{9+4+1}{8} \\pi x^2 = \\frac{14}{8} \\pi x^2 = \\frac{7}{4} \\pi x^2\\)\n\n   - Shaded area:\n     - \\(\\frac{9}{2} \\pi x^2 - \\frac{7}{4} \\pi x^2 = \\frac{18}{4} \\pi x^2 - \\frac{7}{4} \\pi x^2 = \\frac{11}{4} \\pi x^2\\)\n\n4. **Determine Unshaded Area:**\n\n   - Unshaded area = Total area of semicircle \\(AD\\) - Shaded area\n   - \\(\\frac{9}{2} \\pi x^2 - \\frac{11}{4} \\pi x^2 = \\frac{18}{4} \\pi x^2 - \\frac{11}{4} \\pi x^2\\)\n   - Simplified = \\(\\frac{7}{4} \\pi x^2\\)\n\n5. **Ratio of Shaded to Unshaded Area:**\n\n   - Ratio = \\(\\frac{\\frac{11}{4} \\pi x^2}{\\frac{7}{4} \\pi x^2} = \\frac{11}{4} \\div \\frac{7}{4} = \\frac{11}{7}\\)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFinal answer: The ratio of the shaded area to the unshaded area in the semicircle with diameter \\(AD\\) is \\(\\frac{11}{7}\\).\n\nDoes this make sense? Let's double-check. Since both shaded and unshaded areas are derived correctly based on the semicircle division, and division of these terms strictly adheres within their derived proportions, this calculation appears sound. If everything matches, we can be confident in this approach.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the radius of the large semicircle be $6x$.  The diameter of the smallest semicircle is $\\frac{1}{1+2+3} = \\frac16$ of the diameter of the largest semicircle, so the radius of the smallest semicircle is $x$.  Similarly, the radius of the next smallest semicircle is $2x$, and the radius of the next semicircle is $3x$.  The unshaded area then is the sum of the areas of the three smallest semicircles: \\[\\frac12(x)^2\\pi + \\frac12 (2x)^2 \\pi + \\frac12(3x)^2\\pi = \\frac12(x^2 + 4x^2 + 9x^2)\\pi = (7x^2)\\pi.\\] The largest semicircle has area $\\frac12(6x)^2\\pi = 18x^2\\pi$, so the shaded area is \\[18x^2\\pi - 7x^2 \\pi = 11x^2\\pi.\\] Therefore, the desired ratio is \\[\\frac{11x^2\\pi}{7x^2\\pi} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{7}}.\\]"
