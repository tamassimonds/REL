    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're trying to find the probability that a randomly selected shirt from Morgan's closet is not a baseball shirt. Let's tackle this step-by-step:\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Brainstorming\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n    - Morgan has different types of shirts: 3 hockey shirts, 2 football shirts, and 7 baseball shirts.\n    - We need to find the probability that a shirt selected at random is *not* a baseball shirt.\n\n2. **Points to Consider:**\n    - Total number of shirts.\n    - Number of shirts that are not baseball shirts.\n    - Probability as a common fraction.\n\n3. **Possible Strategies:**\n    - One approach is to calculate the number of non-baseball shirts and divide by the total number of shirts. This gives us a straightforward way to find the probability.\n    - Alternatively, we could calculate the probability of selecting a baseball shirt and subtract it from 1, since these two probabilities are complementary.\n\n### Approach and Calculations\n\n1. **Calculate Total Number of Shirts:**\n    - Total shirts = Hockey shirts + Football shirts + Baseball shirts\n    - Total shirts = 3 + 2 + 7\n\n    Let's calculate this:\n\n    \\[\n    \\text{Total shirts} = 3 + 2 + 7 = 12\n    \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Number of Non-Baseball Shirts:**\n    - Non-baseball shirts = Hockey shirts + Football shirts\n    - Non-baseball shirts = 3 + 2\n\n    Let's determine this:\n\n    \\[\n    \\text{Non-baseball shirts} = 3 + 2 = 5\n    \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Probability:**\n    - Probability (P) of not selecting a baseball shirt = (Number of non-baseball shirts) / (Total number of shirts)\n    - \\[\n    P(\\text{Not baseball shirt}) = \\frac{\\text{Non-baseball shirts}}{\\text{Total shirts}} = \\frac{5}{12}\n    \\]\n\n### Reflect and Verify\n\n- **Reflect on the Approach:**\n    - The approach makes sense since we're simply looking at the favorable outcomes (non-baseball shirts) over the total possible outcomes (all shirts).\n\n- **Verify Calculations:**\n    - Total shirts calculation seems accurate: \\(3 + 2 + 7 = 12\\).\n    - Non-baseball shirts calculation also seems correct: \\(3 + 2 = 5\\).\n    - Fraction \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\) seems reasonable and in simplest form.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe correctly calculated that the probability of randomly selecting a shirt that is not a baseball shirt is \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\). This method and verification seem solid, and there's no indication of any missteps in our reasoning or calculations.",

  "ground_truth": "There are $3+2 + 7 =12$ shirts to choose from. A total of $2+3 = 5$ of these, all the hockey and football shirts, are not baseball shirts. So, the probability of not getting a baseball shirt is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{12}}$."
