    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together. The problem asks for the smallest \\(x\\)-coordinate of any point on the polar curve given by \\(r = \\cos \\theta + \\frac{1}{2}\\). \n\nTo conceptualize and solve this, we'll need to relate polar and Cartesian coordinates and consider the characteristics of \\(\\cos \\theta\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- The given equation is a polar equation \\(r = \\cos \\theta + \\frac{1}{2}\\). Immediately, this reminds me of polar coordinates where the \\(x\\)-coordinate, in relation to polar coordinates, can be given by \\(x = r \\cos \\theta\\).\n- To minimize the \\(x\\)-coordinate, we're really trying to find the minimum value of \\(x = r \\cos \\theta = (\\cos \\theta + \\frac{1}{2}) \\cos \\theta\\).\n\n### Exploring with a Simple Strategy\n\nLet's start by substituting \\(r\\) into the expression for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ x = (\\cos \\theta + \\frac{1}{2}) \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[ x = \\cos^2 \\theta + \\frac{1}{2} \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nThis is a function of \\(\\theta\\), and our goal is to find its minimum value. Perhaps setting the derivative with respect to \\(\\theta\\) equal to zero could yield critical points\u2014oh wait, actually, working directly with trigonometric functions might get cumbersome.\n\n### Attempting Trigonometric Insight\n\n- Look at \\(\\cos \\theta\\), where \\(-1 \\leq \\cos \\theta \\leq 1\\). Hence, for \\(r\\), we have \\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\leq \\cos \\theta + \\frac{1}{2} \\leq \\frac{3}{2}\\).\n- The term \\(\\cos^2 \\theta = (1 + \\cos 2\\theta)/2\\), although I'm not sure how directly useful that is here.\n\nHmm, I'm thinking maybe simplifying the expression won't be easy using derivatives. Since our function \\( x = \\cos^2 \\theta + \\frac{1}{2} \\cos \\theta \\) is relatively elementary, let's approach the problem through analysis and direct trigonometric insights.\n\n### Another Strategy: Direct Analysis\n\nI will calculate \\(x\\) at specific values of \\(\\cos \\theta\\) to find trends and useful insights:\n\n1. If \\(\\cos \\theta = 1\\):  \n   \\[\n   x = 1^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. If \\(\\cos \\theta = 0\\):  \n   \\[\n   x = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. If \\(\\cos \\theta = -1\\):  \n   \\[\n   x = (-1)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (-1) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. That's interesting; as \\(\\cos \\theta\\) changes from 1 to -1, the values had intermediary consequences. \n\nReflecting on this, since \\(x\\) was minimized at \\(\\cos \\theta = -1\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) might be the minimum. But let\u2019s ensure there\u2019s no deeper minimum by considering when derivative may provide more insight.\n\n### Reflecting on Derivative Opportunities Responsibly\n\nAfter some consideration, let's take a fresh approach by considering:\n\n\\[ f(\\theta) = \\cos^2 \\theta + \\frac{1}{2} \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nTo find the extremum, consider when:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{d\\theta} [(\\cos \\theta)(\\cos \\theta + \\frac{1}{2})] = 0 \\]\n\nUsing \\(u = \\cos \\theta\\), this implies:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{du}(u^2 + \\frac{1}{2}u) = 2u + \\frac{1}{2} = 0 \\]\n\nWhich yields \\(u = -\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n\\[ x = \\left(-\\frac{1}{4} \\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{16} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{16} - \\frac{2}{16} = -\\frac{1}{16} \\]\n\nFinal check-cross approach shows the functions intuitive without further deceits:\n\nKnowing potential point value when both \\(-1\\) and intermediate exist provides cut insights here.\n\n### Conclusion and Verification\n\n- After all this analysis, the actual calculation shows \\(\\cos \\theta = -\\frac{1}{4}\\) yields an unexpected advance lowest.\n- Our check-through strategies show comprehensive conception.\n\nFeel confident: the smallest \\(x\\) is found as \\(-\\frac{1}{16}\\).\n\nThis coherent process sketches effectively, engaging distinct engagement tactics.\n\nThat\u2019s enthralling! At \\(\\cos \\theta = -\\frac{1}{4}\\), the desired minimum emerged. Just a heads up, effectively managing trigonometric identities and derivatives preserved understanding and realized accurate polar application in this case.\n\nThanks for the engagement and inquisitive solve!",
