    "working_out": "Let's dive into solving this problem step-by-step, including the nuances of my thought process. We\u2019ll tackle this in a very exploratory way, reflecting at each step. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n- First things first, this problem seems to be about calculating expected value in a lottery context. I've seen similar types of problems before, where the core aim is to understand the average outcome over many possible scenarios.\n- The key variables seem to be the cost of the ticket ($3), the jackpot ($250,000), and the number of tickets sold (100,000). \n\n### Brainstorming Potential Approaches\n\n1. **Calculate Expected Winning Without Considering Cost:**\n   - Normally, in expected value problems, we consider the outcomes multiplied by their probabilities.\n   - Here: \n     - Winning the jackpot gives $250,000 with a probability of 1/100,000.\n     - Not winning gives $0 with a probability of 99,999/100,000.\n   - Seems like I\u2019d first determine the expected winnings ignoring the ticket cost, then adjust for the cost.\n\n2. **Incorporate Ticket Cost:**\n   - After finding just the winnings, I would subtract the cost of the ticket to understand the net gain/loss.\n   - The challenge is ensuring these steps correctly reflect what\u2019s being asked.\n\n### Calculating Expected Winnings\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate Probability-Based Winnings\n\n- Probability of winning = 1/100,000.\n- Probability of not winning = 99,999/100,000.\n\n- Expected value (winnings) from the lottery itself:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Expected Winnings} = (250,000 \\times \\frac{1}{100,000}) + (0 \\times \\frac{99,999}{100,000})\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{250,000}{100,000} = 2.5\n  \\]\n- Reflecting: Seems straightforward and logical. Winning back $250,000 spread over 100,000 tickets gives $2.50 on average without considering ticket cost.\n\n#### Step 2: Calculate Expected Outcome Including Ticket Cost\n\n- Subtract the cost of purchasing the ticket from the expected winnings to get the net expected outcome.\n\n- Net expected value:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Net Expected Value} = 2.5 - 3 = -0.5\n  \\]\n\n### Final Reflection and Checking\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** The result means, on average, you lose $0.50 per ticket purchased. This feels right, given that players typically end up losing money in lotteries due to the house edge.\n- **Is the Result Too High or Low?** It\u2019s clearly a negative expected value, aligning with intuition and the nature of lottery games\u2014mostly it's a loss, and only a few strike big wins.\n\n- **Final Thought:** I\u2019m satisfied with the calculations and logic. This kind of detailed breakdown captures the decision-making in probability and expectations. It\u2019s reassuring that it aligns with what I expected from a theoretical lottery setup\u2014most gamble with small, systematic losses and rare huge payoffs.\n\nAll in all, buying a ticket leads to an expected loss of $0.50 per ticket.",

  "ground_truth": "The chance of winning the jackpot is $\\frac{1}{100000}$. The value of the jackpot is $\\$250000$. The expected winnings, minus the cost of the ticket is $E = \\frac{1}{100000} \\cdot \\$250000 - \\$3 = \\$2.50-\\$3.00 = \\boxed{-\\$0.50}$."
