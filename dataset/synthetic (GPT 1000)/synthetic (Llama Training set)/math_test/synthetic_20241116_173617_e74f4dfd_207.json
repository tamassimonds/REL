    "working_out": "Alright, let's jump into this step by step. We need to find the coefficient of \\(a^4b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((2a-\\frac{b}{3})^6\\). The problem involves using the Binomial Theorem, which I remember relates to expanding expressions of the form \\((x+y)^n\\). \n\n### Step 1: Decipher the Problem\nFirst thoughts... the binomial expansion involves coefficients provided by binomial coefficients, \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\). So, yes, this is definitely a binomial expansion problem. For an expression \\((x+y)^n\\), each term in the expansion looks like \\( \\binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k \\).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Components\nWe have \\( (2a - \\frac{b}{3})^6 \\) and we want the specific term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) match \\(a^4b^2\\).\n\n- Let's write down the expression clearly:\n  - \\(x = 2a\\)\n  - \\(y = -\\frac{b}{3}\\)\n  - \\(n = 6\\)\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Term with \\(a^4b^2\\)\nFor \\(a^{4}b^{2}\\), in the general term \\( \\binom{n}{k} (2a)^{n-k} \\left(-\\frac{b}{3}\\right)^k \\), we need:\n- Power of \\(a\\), which is \\(n-k = 4\\) (because that's the exponent of \\(a\\)) \n- Power of \\(b\\), which is \\(k = 2\\) (because that's the exponent of \\(b\\))\n\n### Step 4: Check Combinations for Correct Exponents\nHmm... let\u2019s check that again. For \\(a\\), since it has to be \\(a^4\\), hence:\n- \\(n-k = 4\\) gives \\(k = n - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2\\)\n- And for \\(b^2\\), indeed, \\(k = 2\\).\n\nOkay, this seems consistent.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Coefficient Using Correct Values\nNow, let's calculate the coefficient of this term using the Binomial Theorem:\n\\[ \\text{Coefficient} = \\binom{6}{2}(2a)^{6-2}\\left(-\\frac{b}{3}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the binomial coefficient:\n\\[ \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15 \\]\n\nNext, use this to plug back in:\n\\[ = \\binom{6}{2} (2a)^{4} \\left(-\\frac{b}{3}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nAlright, solving further:\n\\[ (2a)^4 = 2^4 \\times a^4 = 16a^4 \\]\n\\[ \\left(-\\frac{b}{3}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{b}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{b^2}{9} \\]\n\nPutting it together:\n\\[ 15 \\times 16a^4 \\times \\frac{b^2}{9} = 15 \\times 16 \\times a^4 \\times b^2 \\times \\frac{1}{9} \\]\n\n### Final Calculation\n\\[ = \\frac{15 \\times 16}{9} \\times a^4 b^2 \\]\n\nCalculate the numerical coefficient:\n\\[ = \\frac{240}{9} = \\frac{80}{3} \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter checking my calculations, I find the coefficient for \\(a^4b^2\\) in the expansion is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{80}{3}}\\). I've also checked my steps, and everything seems coherent with the Binomial Theorem, applying correct indices and calculations at each junction. Looks like we've arrived at the right answer, considering the powers and distribution within the expression.",
