    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. When I first look at it, the expression \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{24}}{\\sqrt{30}}\\div\\frac{\\sqrt{20}}{3\\sqrt{25}}\\) seems relatively complex but not unfamiliar. The most important thing at the outset is to simplify this expression by breaking it down into manageable parts.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Expression\nBefore doing anything, let's recap what we have:\n- The expression can be rewritten as: \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{24}}{\\sqrt{30}} \\times \\frac{3\\sqrt{25}}{\\sqrt{20}}\\).\n  This is because dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. \n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Radicals\nNow I want to simplify these square root expressions individually:\n- \\(\\sqrt{24}\\): I know that 24 can be factored into \\(4 \\times 6\\), and since \\(\\sqrt{4} = 2\\), it simplifies to \\(2\\sqrt{6}\\).\n- \\(\\sqrt{30}\\): This is \\(5 \\times 6\\), but neither is a perfect square, so it'll stay \\(\\sqrt{30}\\).\n- \\(\\sqrt{20}\\): This can be factored into \\(4 \\times 5\\), and therefore it simplifies to \\(2\\sqrt{5}\\).\n- \\(\\sqrt{25}\\): This is \\(5\\), since it is a perfect square. \n\nTaking all this into account, let's substitute these simplified forms back into our expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{30}} \\times \\frac{3 \\times 5}{2\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Expression Further\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{30}} \\times \\frac{15}{2\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\nHere, I notice that \\(2\\) can cancel out:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{30}} \\times \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\nLet's combine the radicals in the first fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{6/30}} \\times \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\nThis becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{1/5}} \\times \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\nNow, simplifying \\(\\sqrt{1/5}\\), I know this is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{5}}\\), therefore:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\times \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Bring it All Together\nMultiply across the expressions:\n\\[\n\\frac{15 \\times 1}{\\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{15}{5}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to 3.\n\n**Check**: This solution seems straightforward and correct since the steps logically follow from properties of radicals and fraction multiplication.\n\nHence, the simplified value of the original expression is \\( \\boxed{3} \\).\n\n### Reflection\nI took a manageable approach, breaking down the problem into parts I could handle individually. At each step, I checked for unnecessary complexity and focused on simplification, a strategy that worked well here. Each stage reinforced the previous, leading seamlessly to the final answer.",
