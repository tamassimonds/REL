    "working_out": "Alright, looking at the problem at hand, we have an arithmetic sequence: \\(y + 6\\), \\(12\\), and \\(y\\). \n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts: This problem involves an arithmetic sequence, which means each term increases by the same amount. I should recall that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. That constant is often denoted as \\(d\\).\n\nSo, I need to check the differences between each pair of consecutive terms. \n\n**Step 2: Explore Initial Strategies**\n\nOkay, let's lay out what we know about arithmetic sequences:\n\n- The first term is \\(y + 6\\).\n- The second term is \\(12\\).\n- The third term is \\(y\\).\n\nThe difference between the first term (\\(y + 6\\)) and the second term (\\(12\\)) should be equal to the difference between the second term (\\(12\\)) and the third term (\\(y\\)). In equation form:\n\\[ 12 - (y + 6) = y - 12 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Set Up the Equation**\n\nLet me try to express these differences more clearly:\n- The difference between the first and second terms:\n  \\[\n  12 - (y + 6) = 12 - y - 6 = 6 - y\n  \\]\n\n- The difference between the second and third terms:\n  \\[\n  y - 12\n  \\]\n\nSet these differences equal to each other because they should be the same:\n\\[ \n6 - y = y - 12 \n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Equation**\n\nNow, I'll solve for \\(y\\):\n1. Add \\(y\\) to both sides to get:\n   \\[\n   6 = 2y - 12\n   \\]\n\n2. Add \\(12\\) to both sides:\n   \\[\n   18 = 2y\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   y = 9\n   \\]\n\n**Step 5: Check the Solution**\n\nOkay, now that I have \\(y = 9\\), let's double-check it:\n\n- Plug \\(y = 9\\) back into the sequence: The sequence becomes \\(9 + 6\\), \\(12\\), \\(9\\), which simplifies to \\(15\\), \\(12\\), \\(9\\).\n\nChecking the differences:\n- Difference between the first and second terms: \\(12 - 15 = -3\\).\n- Difference between the second and third terms: \\(9 - 12 = -3\\). \n\nBoth differences are the same, so my solution seems correct.\n\n**Step 6: Final Reflection**\n\nThe approach makes sense: I set up the equation correctly by using the properties of arithmetic sequences. The value found for \\(y\\), which is 9, checks out when back-substituted into the sequence. Every step logically follows from the previous one, and the sequence behaves as expected for an arithmetic sequence.\n\nSo, the value of \\(y\\) is \\(9\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The difference between the second and first term is $12 - (y + 6) = 6 - y$, and the difference between the third and second term is $y - 12$.  These must be equal, so $6 - y = y - 12$.  Solving for $y$, we find $y = \\boxed{9}$."
