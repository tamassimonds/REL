    "working_out": "Alright, let's get started by diving into the problem. The task is to find the sum of three fractions: \\(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nInitially, my gut reaction is that these fractions can be summed because they share a commonality involving powers of 2 in the denominators. They appear to be getting smaller with each term. Let's note these details:\n\n- These fractions have denominators that are powers of 2: \\(2, 4,\\) and \\(8\\).\n- This pattern gives a hint about finding a common denominator, which helps when adding fractions.\n\n### Step 2: Explore Common Strategies\nThere are different ways to add fractions, but the most straightforward method involves using a common denominator:\n\n1. **Find a common denominator:** \n   Since the smallest denominator that all terms can share is obtained by taking the highest of the denominators involved, I choose 8 as the common denominator. It's the smallest number that 2, 4, and 8 all divide evenly into.\n\n2. **Convert each fraction:**\n   - Convert \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to have 8 as the denominator. Since \\(8 = 2 \\times 4\\), we multiply the numerator and denominator by 4. Hence, \\(\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{4}{8}\\).\n   - Convert \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) similarly. Since \\(8 = 4 \\times 2\\), multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2: \\(\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{8}\\).\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) is already in the correct form, \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Add the Fractions\nNow I've got the fractions with a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\nAdd these by simply adding their numerators:\n\n- \\(4 + 2 + 1 = 7\\)\n\nSo, the sum of these fractions is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{8}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Check the Calculation\nReflect for a moment. This solution makes sense because I followed a logical sequence of steps to find a common denominator, converted each fraction appropriately, and added them correctly.\n\n- Quick sanity check: The result \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\) is reasonable since each fraction, when summed, totals to a number that's less than 1. Adding smaller-than-whole numbers often gives a number less than 1, which matches our conclusion.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nThe chosen approach was efficient, leveraging the commonality in the powers of 2 for the denominator. I feel confident the steps are correct because they intuitively align with my understanding of fraction addition. I have no random insights for a simpler method here, as this approach seems direct and clear.\n\nLet me know if you have further questions or need additional explanations!",
