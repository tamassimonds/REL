    "working_out": "Alright, let's begin by diving into this problem step by step, and I'll share my thought process as I work through it.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the expression \\([1 - (-1)^{11}]^2\\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- At first glance, this problem involves exponents and subtraction within brackets, followed by squaring the result.\n- This looks similar to problems I've encountered before where simplifying the expression within the parentheses is key.\n\n**Strategizing:**\n\n1. **Deal with the exponent:**\n   - The term \\((-1)^{11}\\) involves a negative base raised to an odd power.\n\n2. **Subtract within the brackets:**\n   - Determine what's inside the brackets, then calculate the outer square.\n\n**Step-by-step Evaluation:**\n\n1. **Evaluate \\((-1)^{11}:**\n   - When a negative number is raised to an odd power, the result is negative. \n   - So, \\((-1)^{11} = -1\\).\n\n   *Check*: Since \\(11\\) is odd, this result seems correct.\n\n2. **Substitute and simplify \\([1 - (-1)]^2:**\n   - Replace \\((-1)^{11}\\) with \\(-1\\): \\([1 - (-1)]^2\\).\n   - Simplify inside the brackets: \\(1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2\\).\n\n   *Pause and reflect*: The subtraction turned into an addition because subtracting a negative is the same as adding. This simplification makes sense.\n\n3. **Calculate \\((2)^2:**\n   - Finally, square the result: \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n\n**Final Thoughts and Verification:**\n\n- Reflecting on each step, the calculations seem straightforward. Each part seems logically consistent with mathematical rules.\n- The final value makes sense given the simplifications, and there were no unexpected results in any of the steps.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evaluated expression \\([1 - (-1)^{11}]^2\\) simplifies to \\(4\\).\n\nBy breaking down each part, checking along the way, and reflecting on the accuracy, I am confident the solution is correct. This approach helps ensure accuracy and develop a deeper understanding of the problem.",
