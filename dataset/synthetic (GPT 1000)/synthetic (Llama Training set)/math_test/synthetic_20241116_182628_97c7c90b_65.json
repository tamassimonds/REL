    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nWe're dealing with a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + 32x + c = 0 \\) that has exactly one solution. That phrase immediately makes me think of the condition for a quadratic equation to have one solution\u2014when its discriminant is zero. The discriminant of a quadratic in the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by \\( b^2 - 4ac \\).\n\nOkay, I need to remember two things: \n1. The discriminant should be zero for the equation to have exactly one solution.\n2. The condition that \\( a + c = 130 \\).\n\n### Developing a Plan\n1. **Use the Discriminant Condition:**  \n   Let's find the discriminant of the given quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + 32x + c = 0 \\). Here, \\( b = 32 \\), so the discriminant is \\( 32^2 - 4ac = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Set Up the Discriminant Equation:**\n   \\[\n   32^2 - 4ac = 0\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   1024 = 4ac\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify:**  \n   \\[\n   ac = \\frac{1024}{4} = 256\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the System of Equations:**  \n   Now we have a system of two equations:\n   \\[\n   a + c = 130\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   ac = 256\n   \\]\n\n### Solving the System\nFrom the two equations, \\( a + c = 130 \\) and \\( ac = 256 \\), I recognize this as a typical setup for solving with symmetric polynomials. This makes me think of the roots of a quadratic equation. Generally, these represent the roots \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) of a quadratic equation formed by \\( t^2 - (a+c)t + ac = 0 \\).\n\n#### Solving for \\( a \\) and \\( c \\):\nLet's treat them as the roots of a quadratic:\n- \\( t^2 - 130t + 256 = 0 \\)\n\nWait, I should check if this gives real roots. Use the discriminant:\n\\[\n130^2 - 4 \\times 256 = 16900 - 1024 = 15876\n\\]\n15876 is positive, so the quadratic equation indeed has real roots.\n\n#### Calculate the Roots:\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{130 \\pm \\sqrt{15876}}{2}\n\\]\n\nFinding \\(\\sqrt{15876}\\) seems tricky by hand, but if I notice that \\(15876\\) is actually \\(168^2\\), which simplifies things:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{130 \\pm 126}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n1. \\( t = \\frac{130 + 126}{2} = \\frac{256}{2} = 128 \\)\n2. \\( t = \\frac{130 - 126}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\)\n\n### Conclusion\nRemember that we were looking for \\( a > c \\). Thus, in this scenario, \\( a = 128 \\) and \\( c = 2 \\).\n\nI'll double-check the conditions:\n- \\( a + c = 130 \\): \n   - Indeed, \\( 128 + 2 = 130 \\).\n- \\( ac = 256 \\): \n   - Indeed, \\( 128 \\times 2 = 256 \\).\n\nEverything checks out. So the solution, the ordered pair \\((a, c)\\), is \\((128, 2)\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since the quadratic has only one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero. The discriminant is $b^2-4ac=1024-4ac=0$, so $ac=\\frac{1024}{4}=256$. We need to find $a$ and $c$ given $a+c=130$ and $ac=256$. We could write a quadratic equation and solve, but instead we rely on clever algebraic manipulations: Since $a+c=130$, we have $$(a+c)^2=a^2+c^2+2ac=130^2=16900.$$We subtract $4ac=1024$ from each side to find $$a^2+c^2+2ac-4ac=a^2+c^2-2ac=16900-1024=15876.$$We recognize each side as a square, so we take the square root of both sides: $$\\sqrt{a^2+c^2-2ac}=\\sqrt{(a-c)^2}=a-c=\\sqrt{15876}=126.$$(Technically we should take the positive and negative square root of both sides, but since $a>c$ we know $a-c>0$.) Thus we have  \\begin{align*}\na-c&=126\\\\\na+c&=130\n\\end{align*}Summing these equations gives \\begin{align*}\n2a&=256\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=128,\n\\end{align*}and $c=130-a=2$. Thus our ordered pair $(a,c)$ is $\\boxed{(128,2)}$."
