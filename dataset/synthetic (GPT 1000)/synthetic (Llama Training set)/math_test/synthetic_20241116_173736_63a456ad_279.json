    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- The expression \\((a) \\times (b) = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) reminds me of expanding a binomial square. Specifically, this looks similar to the expansion \\((a + b)^2\\), which is quite familiar. That could be helpful to explore since the expression shares the same form.\n- I'm given \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 5\\) and need to evaluate \\((3) \\times (5)\\).\n\n**Brainstorming Approach:**\n- Initially, I'll try evaluating the expression as it's defined: \\(3^2 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 + 5^2\\). Let's simplify it step by step.\n- Alternatively, if this feels too complex or I encounter issues, exploring the form \\((a+b)^2\\) might help me understand the process more intuitively.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n1. **Calculate \\(a^2\\):**\n   - I have \\(a = 3\\), so \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n   - Reflecting on this: Seems straightforward. No issues here.\n\n2. **Calculate \\(2ab\\):**\n   - I have \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 5\\), so \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30\\).\n   - Quick reflection: The multiplication seems fine \u2014 \\(2 \\cdot 3\\) is indeed 6, and \\(6 \\cdot 5\\) equals 30. Good.\n\n3. **Calculate \\(b^2\\):**\n   - I have \\(b = 5\\), so \\(5^2 = 25\\).\n   - Double-check: The calculation \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) is correct. Moving on.\n\n4. **Sum these components:**\n   - Now put it all together: \\(9 + 30 + 25\\).\n   - \\(9 + 30 = 39\\), then \\(39 + 25 = 64\\).\n   - Reflect: Let me double-check this sum to make sure no oversight occurred. Calculations seems consistent through small re-calculations.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- The result \\(64\\) aligns with my calculations and expectations based on the expression. Re-evaluating steps confers no errors. The resemblance to \\((a + b)^2\\) was more of an observation, but consistency remains via direct computation.\n- Therefore, the value of \\((3) \\times (5)\\) in the context of the given expression is indeed \\(64\\).\n\n**Concluding Thoughts:**\n- Everything checks out. If I think about the expression \\((a + b)^2\\), this ensures my initial parallel observation was correct \u2014 this form matched our direct computation precisely.\n- Comfortable concluding \\((3) \\times (5) = 64\\) fits the formulation accurately.\n\nThere we have it! Feels good to break down the process thoroughly with steps and validations throughout.",
