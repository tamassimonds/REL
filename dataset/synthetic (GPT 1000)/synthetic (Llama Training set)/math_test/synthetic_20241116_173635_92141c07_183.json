    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving \\(\\cos 300^\\circ\\). Here's how I think through the problem:\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- When I first see \\(300^\\circ\\), I realize this angle is definitely related to common angles but isn't one of the standard values like \\(0^\\circ\\), \\(90^\\circ\\), \\(180^\\circ\\), or \\(270^\\circ\\).\n- It looks like \\(300^\\circ\\) could be thought of as something around the circle, so maybe using its relation to such angles in the unit circle could be useful.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Using the Unit Circle:**\n    - I remember that the unit circle is very helpful when dealing with angles like this. Perhaps trying to identify what quadrant \\(300^\\circ\\) falls into could simplify the problem.\n\n2. **Angle Relation:**\n    - I could also think of \\(300^\\circ\\) as a related angle to a more typical angle (say \\(60^\\circ\\)), and see if I can use known cosine values from there.\n\n3. **Conversion to Radians:**\n    - Sometimes converting the degree measure to radians makes things easier, especially if I'm potentially remembering the unit circle from a radian viewpoint. But I'm inclined to think directly in degrees here first.\n\n**Checking First Steps:**\n\n- **Locate on Unit Circle:** \\(300^\\circ\\) is more than \\(270^\\circ\\), but less than \\(360^\\circ\\). Therefore, it should be in the fourth quadrant. This kind of critical thinking reminds me that angles in the fourth quadrant have positive cosine values.\n\n- **Reference Angle:** \n    - To simplify things, I can find the reference angle for \\(300^\\circ\\). I subtract \\(300^\\circ\\) from \\(360^\\circ\\) to see how far it is from the x-axis. \n    \\[\n    360^\\circ - 300^\\circ = 60^\\circ\n    \\]\n    - Therefore, the reference angle is \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\n**Aha Moment:**\n\n- Knowing the reference angle is \\(60^\\circ\\) is incredibly useful because I do know \\(\\cos 60^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}\\). And because we are in the fourth quadrant, the cosine of the original angle, \\(\\cos 300^\\circ\\), will take the same positive sign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Finally, since \\(300^\\circ\\) is indeed in the fourth quadrant and the cosine in this quadrant is positive, I conclude that:\n\\[\n\\cos 300^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Let's verify: If the reference angle is \\(60^\\circ\\) and cosine in the fourth quadrant remains positive; sure enough, \\(\\cos 300^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}\\) fits what I derived.\n- This analytic path checks out both logically and by commonly known facts about cosine for standard angles.\n\nThis step-by-step demonstrated how the understanding of geometric principles and reference angles on the unit circle leads directly to the answer.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial response regarding the cosine of \\(300^\\circ\\). Let's re-evaluate my approach and integrate the correct findings seamlessly.\n\n**Re-evaluating Initial Thoughts:**\n\nLet's start by reminding ourselves of some important details:\n\n- \\(300^\\circ\\) is indeed in the fourth quadrant of the unit circle.\n- The cosine of an angle in this quadrant should be positive.\n- The reference angle for \\(300^\\circ\\) is \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\n**Previous Approaches:**\n\nI had initially concluded that \\(\\cos 300^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}\\) based on these observations. However, it seems a deeper exploration and validation of this solution could be more insightful.\n\n**Exploring Alternative Methods:**\n\n1. **Unit Circle Verification:**\n\n   Let's consider the placement of the point \\(P\\) on the unit circle when an angle of \\(300^\\circ\\) is made from the positive x-axis. The triangle formed with the x-axis will be a \\(30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ\\) triangle since the angle from \\(300^\\circ\\) back to the x-axis measures \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\n   In such a triangle, we automatically know:\n\n   - The cosine corresponds to the x-coordinate of the point \\(P\\).\n   - In a \\(30-60-90\\) triangle, the lengths in terms of the hypotenuse (radius of the unit circle, which is \\(1\\)) are that the shorter leg is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (adjacent side here, hence the cosine value) and the longer leg is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Analysis through Triangles:**\n\n   Confirming through the triangle's geometry:\n   \n   - Let's place point \\(O\\) as the origin, \\(P\\) as \\(300^\\circ\\) from the x-axis, and project a line down to the x-axis creating a right triangle with point \\(D\\), the foot of the altitude to the x-axis.\n   - The coordinates of \\(P\\) can hence be: \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\).\n\n   This matches our expectation since the cosine values remain positive in the fourth quadrant.\n\n**Reflecting on Solutions:**\n\n- Calculating using the properties of triangles and referencing the unit circle confirms that \\(\\cos 300^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}\\). This solution is consistent with my previous, albeit a bit rushed, conclusions but now solidified with the geometric visual confirmation.\n\n- I feel more assured now after considering the geometric angle, the triangle placements, and confirming with known trigonometric properties that my resulting value of \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) indeed holds across different strategies.\n\nThus, after careful re-evaluation and corroboration using multiple methods, my final answer remains \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial response regarding the cosine of \\(300^\\circ\\).
