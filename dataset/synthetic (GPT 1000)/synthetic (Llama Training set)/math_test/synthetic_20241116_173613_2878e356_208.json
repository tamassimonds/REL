    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\nOkay, so we have a really straightforward problem involving the volume of a cylinder. The question is asking for the height of the cylinder given its volume and radius. I know the formula for the volume of a cylinder is \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\), where \\( V \\) is the volume, \\( r \\) is the radius of the base, and \\( h \\) is the height. I already have the volume and radius, so it looks like I'm just solving for \\( h \\).\n\nBrainstorming Potential Approaches:\n\n1. Direct substitution: I could directly substitute the values into the volume formula and solve for the height. This seems straightforward and should be my first approach because I already have all the needed values.\n   \n2. Dimensional Analysis: Maybe I could verify by checking the dimensions. But since this problem is more straightforward, I might not need to rely on this approach.\n\n3. Approximation: Considering the presence of \\(\\pi\\) in the values, I could quickly check if the numbers make sense when \\(\\pi\\) is treated as approximately \\(3.14\\). This can be a sanity check.\n\nLet's go with the direct substitution approach first and solve for \\(h\\).\n\nStep-by-step Solution:\n\n**Step 1: Write the Known Information**\n\n- Volume of the cylinder (\\(V\\)) = \\(2700\\pi\\) cubic meters\n- Radius of the base (\\(r\\)) = 30 meters\n\n**Step 2: Write the Formula for Volume of a Cylinder**\n\nThe formula is \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\).\n\n**Step 3: Substitution**\n\nFrom the known information, substitute into the formula:\n\\[ 2700\\pi = \\pi \\times (30)^2 \\times h \\]\n\n**Step 4: Simplification**\n\nLet\u2019s eliminate \\(\\pi\\) from both sides to simplify:\n\\[ 2700 = 30^2 \\times h \\]\n\nNow, calculate \\(30^2\\):\n\\[ 30^2 = 900 \\]\n\nSubstitute this back into the equation:\n\\[ 2700 = 900 \\times h \\]\n\n**Step 5: Solve for Height (\\(h\\))**\n\nDivide both sides by 900 to isolate \\(h\\):\n\\[ h = \\frac{2700}{900} \\]\n\nCalculate the right side:\n\\[ h = 3 \\]\n\nHmm, let me take a moment to check if it makes sense: \n\n- **Quick Reflection:** Given the base area is \\(\\pi \\times 900\\), having a height of 3 sort of checks out. The volume calculation still leads us to 2700\\(\\pi\\), which was provided.  \n\n- **Dimensional Sanity Check:** The dimensions \\(m^2 \\times m\\) certainly yield \\(m^3\\), verifying that the calculations correspond correctly.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe height of the water tank is 3 meters. The calculations went smoothly, and all checks came out consistent with expectations.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the height measure $h$ meters.  By the formula for the area of a cylinder, which states that $V=\\pi r^2 h$ where $V, r, h$ denote volume, radius and height respectively, we have \\[2700\\pi = \\pi (30)^2 h.\\]Solving yields $h = \\boxed{3}$ meters."
