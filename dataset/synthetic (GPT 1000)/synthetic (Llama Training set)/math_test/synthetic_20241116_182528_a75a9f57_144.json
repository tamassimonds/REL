    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The problem tells us there's a square with a perimeter of 28 cm, and we need to determine the area of that square. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Okay, whenever I see a square, I immediately think about its properties: all sides are equal, and the area is the side length squared.\n- Perimeter of a square\u2014sounds like something I\u2019ve seen before. \n- Perimeter can help us find the side length, which is crucial since the area formula for a square is side length squared.\n\n**Brainstorming Different Approaches:**\n\n1. **Using Perimeter to Find Side Length:** \n   - Since the perimeter is given, I can use it to find the side length of the square. \n   - Perimeter of a square formula is \\( \\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\times \\text{Side length} \\).\n   - If I know this, I can plug in the perimeter and solve for the side.\n\n2. **Direct Substitution:**\n   - Maybe directly using the perimeter to deduce the side without working backward could work? \n   - No, I realize side length calculation is necessary for answering the question of area.\n\n3. **Working Backwards:**\n   - Understand if there are any reversed steps that could be fruitful. \n   - Check perimeter calculation for potential insight.\n\n**Let\u2019s Execute Plan 1 (Finding Side Length):**\n\n- Formula: \\(\\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\times \\text{Side length}\\)\n- I\u2019ll use this formula to find the side length:\n  \\[\n  4 \\times \\text{Side length} = 28 \\text{ cm}\n  \\]\n\n- To find the side length, divide both sides by 4:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Side length} = \\frac{28 \\text{ cm}}{4} = 7 \\text{ cm}\n  \\]\n\n- Side length found! It\u2019s 7 cm. This feels right since dividing evenly by 4 like this in a square makes sense.\n\n**Calculating Area:**\n\n- With the side length now known, I can find the area using the formula:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = (\\text{Side length})^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = (7 \\text{ cm})^2 = 49 \\text{ cm}^2\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection and Checking:**\n\n- Does \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\)? Yes, that matches the given perimeter, confirming that our side length is correct.\n- Squaring the side length to get 49 cm\u00b2 also feels right based on the understanding of squares.\n- The simple logical steps of dividing the perimeter and then squaring ensure I didn't overcomplicate or make assumptions beyond basic square properties.\n\nThis solution approach follows a logical flow that combines confirmative steps with calculations ensuring accuracy. If there were errors, it would show in one of these smaller confirmation steps.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe area of the square is \\(49 \\text{ cm}^2\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since the four sides of a square are equal in length and the perimeter is $28,$ then each side has length $\\frac{28}{4}=7.$  The area of the square is the product of the length and width, which are each equal to $7.$ Therefore, the area of the square in $\\mbox{cm}^2$ is $7\\times7=\\boxed{49}.$"
