    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\nAlright, looking at this problem, it has a couple of parts that need exploring. The first equation, \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = 5\\), can be rewritten into something that looks more familiar. Rewriting it gives \\(y + x = 5xy\\). The second equation is about multiplying and rearranging things, says \\(3xy + x + y = 4\\). There\u2019s a similar structure here, and it seems like there\u2019s symmetry in the way they\u2019re structured, which might suggest substitution or elimination. \n\nThese types of problems often involve getting \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), but I\u2019m not sure if we need to actually solve for them explicitly. It\u2019s more about playing with these equations to find an expression for \\(x^2y + xy^2\\). I get the feeling this could involve symmetry or some connection between the two equations since they both involve terms like \\(xy\\), \\(x\\), and \\(y\\).\n\nStep-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Rearranging the First Equation**:  \n   \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = 5\\) can be rearranged to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x + y}{xy} = 5 \\implies x + y = 5xy.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substituting in the Second Equation**:  \n   We have a substitution candidate from the first equation: \\(x + y = 5xy\\).\n   Substitute this into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   3xy + 5xy = 4 \\implies 8xy = 4.\n   \\]\n   Solving this gives:\n   \\[\n   xy = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Understanding the Target Expression**:  \n   The expression we need is \\(x^2y + xy^2\\), which can be factored as:\n   \\[\n   xy(x + y).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Using Known Values to Find the Desired Expression**:  \n   From our earlier work, we have \\(xy = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x + y = 5xy = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}\\).\n\n5. **Calculate \\(x^2y + xy^2\\)**:  \n   Now substitute the values into the expression:\n   \\[\n   xy(x+y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{5}{4}.\n   \\]\n\nChecking each step:\n\n- Does \\(x + y = 5xy\\) feel right? It traces back to simplifying the fractions correctly.\n- Does solving for \\(xy\\) logically fit with \\(8xy = 4\\)? Yes.\n- Any arithmetic mishaps, especially in transferring the expression to a factored form? Double-checked and all seems right.\n\nReflect and Conclude:\n\nThe key insight was recognizing that both equations shared a commonality that hinted at substitution. By solving directly for \\(xy\\), and using its linkage with expression formulations, we didn\u2019t need explicit \\(x\\) or \\(y\\). This reconfirmation shows the \\(x^2y + xy^2\\) evaluates correctly to \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\).\n\nOverall, understanding the symmetry, rearranging, and using substitution effectively let us solve in a structured and logical manner.",

  "ground_truth": "The first equation becomes\n\n$$\\frac{x+y}{xy}=5\\Rightarrow x+y=5xy.$$\n\nSubstituting into the second equation,\n\n$$8xy=4\\Rightarrow xy=\\frac{1}{2}.$$\n\nThus $x+y=\\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nThe quantity we desire factors as $xy(x+y)$, so it is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{4}}$."
