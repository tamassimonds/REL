    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step and explore different strategies while reflecting on our approach.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nI see the expression \\(\\left(\\frac{100}{101}\\right)^{-3}\\left(\\frac{100}{101}\\right)^{3}\\) and it looks related to properties of exponents. This reminds me of something like: \\((a^{-n})(a^n)\\) because it has two exponents multiplied together.\n\n### Strategy Brainstorm\nA few strategies come to mind:\n1. Use the properties of exponents directly.\n2. Simplify each part separately before combining them.\n3. Consider simplifying the expression into another form that might make it easier to handle.\n\n### Let's Dive In\n#### Step 1: Identify the Property\nUsing the properties of exponents, I know that \\((a^m)(a^n) = a^{m+n}\\). This is the key property that seems helpful.\n\n#### Step 2: Apply the Property\nSo, applying the property \\((a^m)(a^n) = a^{m+n}\\) to this expression, I get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{100}{101}\\right)^{-3} \\left(\\frac{100}{101}\\right)^{3} = \\left(\\frac{100}{101}\\right)^{-3 + 3}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 3: Simplify the Exponent\nThe exponents \\(-3\\) and \\(3\\) should add up to \\(0\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{100}{101}\\right)^{-3 + 3} = \\left(\\frac{100}{101}\\right)^{0}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the Expression\nNow, from the rules of exponents, we know that any non-zero number raised to the power of \\(0\\) is \\(1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{100}{101}\\right)^{0} = 1\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\nLet me quickly check if this makes sense. The expression has been simplified correctly using the properties of exponents. The approach I took was direct, applying a basic rule, and it seemed to work nicely here. It was good to explore these properties upfront rather than over-complicating things. It would have been easy to go in the direction of trying to simplify the fractions themselves, but focusing on the exponent properties right away turned out to be efficient.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe simplified result of the given expression \\(\\left(\\frac{100}{101}\\right)^{-3}\\left(\\frac{100}{101}\\right)^{3}\\) is indeed \\(\\boxed{1}\\). Everything checks out with my calculations and reasoning. This solution method felt clear and straightforward for this particular problem.",

  "ground_truth": "By definition, if $a$ is nonzero, then $a^{-3}$ is the reciprocal of $a^3$.  So, $\\left(\\frac{100}{101}\\right)^3$ and $\\left(\\frac{100}{101}\\right)^{-3}$ are reciprocals.  Therefore, their product is $\\boxed{1}$."
