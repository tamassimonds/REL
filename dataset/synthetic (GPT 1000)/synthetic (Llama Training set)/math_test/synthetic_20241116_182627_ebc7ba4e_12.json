  "problem": "Kelly drove north for 9 miles and then east for 12 miles at an average rate of 42 miles per hour to arrive at the town of Prime. Brenda left from the same location, at the same time, and drove along a straight road to Prime at an average rate of 45 miles per hour. How many minutes earlier than Kelly did Brenda arrive?",

    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- Okay, we have a classic distance problem here with two people traveling from the same starting point to the same destination, but taking different routes. \n- My initial reaction is that this might relate to the Pythagorean theorem because Kelly travels in two perpendicular segments (north and east), forming a right-angle triangle.\n- Brenda travels on a straight line, which is essentially the hypotenuse of the triangle Kelly travels. \n- I know both travel at different speeds, so we\u2019ll have to figure out the times for each and compare them.\n\n1. **Analyzing Kelly's Route:**\n   - Kelly goes 9 miles north and 12 miles east.\n   - This forms a right-angled triangle. \n   - I\u2019m thinking of using the Pythagorean theorem to find the direct distance Brenda travels, which is the hypotenuse.\n\n2. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   - Formula: \\( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\)\n   - \\( a = 9 \\), \\( b = 12 \\).\n   - Calculating: \\( c^2 = 9^2 + 12^2 \\)\n   - Which is \\( c^2 = 81 + 144 = 225 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( c = \\sqrt{225} = 15 \\).\n   - So, Brenda\u2019s distance to Prime is 15 miles.\n\n3. **Time Calculation for Kelly:**\n   - Kelly travels a total distance of \\( 9 + 12 = 21 \\) miles.\n   - She travels at 42 miles per hour.\n   - Time taken by Kelly = \\( \\frac{21}{42} \\) hours.\n   - \\( = 0.5 \\) hours, which is 30 minutes.\n   - Wait, this seems straightforward, let me check if it makes sense...\n   - Yes, Kelly indeed takes 30 minutes because \\( \\frac{21}{42} = 0.5 \\).\n\n4. **Time Calculation for Brenda:**\n   - Brenda travels 15 miles at 45 miles per hour.\n   - Time taken by Brenda = \\( \\frac{15}{45} = \\frac{1}{3} \\) hours.\n   - \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) hours is 20 minutes.\n   - Let me verify this: \\( 15 \\div 45 = 0.3333... \\), which really is 1/3 of an hour. Yes, it checks out. \n\n5. **Comparison and Conclusion:**\n   - Let\u2019s compute the difference in their arrival times.\n   - Kelly's time = 30 minutes, Brenda's time = 20 minutes.\n   - Brenda arrives \\( 30 - 20 = 10 \\) minutes earlier than Kelly.\n\nReflection:\n- The approach using the Pythagorean theorem feels solid because of the perpendicular nature of Kelly\u2019s path.\n- I verified each calculation step, ensuring they align correctly with the initial assumptions laid out.\n- There was a good balance of using geometry for the distances and arithmetic for the times.\n- This solution makes intuitive sense because Brenda\u2019s straight-line path is shorter, and she moves slightly faster. \n- Ending on confidence in the result: Brenda indeed arrives 10 minutes earlier.",

  "ground_truth": "We can start by drawing a diagram of the routes that each of them took: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,9)--(12,9)--cycle,linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"9\",(0,4.5),W);\nlabel(\"12\",(6,9),N);\nlabel(\"15\",(6,4.5),SE);\n[/asy] The two routes form a 9-12-15 right triangle.  Kelly drove for $9+12=21$ miles at a rate of 42 miles per hour, so she drove for $21/42=.5$ hours which equals 30 minutes.  Brenda drove for 15 miles at an average rate of 45 miles per hour, so she drove for $15/45\\cdot 60=20$ minutes.  Thus, Brenda arrived $30-20=\\boxed{10}$ minutes earlier than Kelly."
