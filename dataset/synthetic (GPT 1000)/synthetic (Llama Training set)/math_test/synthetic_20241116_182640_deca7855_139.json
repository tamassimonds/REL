    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and I'll articulate my thought process as clearly as possible:\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n1. **Recognizing the Problem Type**: At first glance, this problem involves finding a line equation in the slope-intercept form \\( y = mx + b \\) from a given parametric form. I've encountered problems like these before, so I know the transformation involves finding both the slope \\( m \\) and the intercept \\( b \\).\n\n2. **Parametric to Slope-Intercept**: I remember that the given form \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) shows how \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) vary with parameter \\(t\\). This represents a line parameterized in terms of \\(t\\).\n\n3. **Strategy Formulation**: My aim is to eliminate \\(t\\) and express \\(y\\) directly in terms of \\(x\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Process\n\n#### Step 1: Express \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in terms of \\(t\\)\n\n- From the parameterization:\n  - \\(x = 8 + 2t\\)\n  - \\(y = -1 + 3t\\)\n\nThis gives us two separate equations that describe \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) based on \\(t\\). \n\n#### Step 2: Eliminate \\(t\\) \n\n- I need to express \\(t\\) in terms of \\(x\\) (or \\(y\\)), and then substitute into the other equation. Let's solve for \\(t\\) using the equation for \\(x\\):\n  - \\(x = 8 + 2t\\)\n  - Rearranging gives \\(x - 8 = 2t\\)\n  - Therefore, \\(t = \\frac{x - 8}{2}\\)\n\n#### Step 3: Substitute \\(t\\) expression into \\(y\\) equation\n\n- Using the expression we derived for \\(t\\), substitute it into the equation for \\(y\\):\n  - \\(y = -1 + 3t\\)\n  - Plugging in \\(t\\), we get: \n  \\[\n  y = -1 + 3 \\left(\\frac{x - 8}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n  - Simplify this: \n  \\[\n  y = -1 + \\frac{3}{2}(x - 8)\n  \\]\n  - Distribute \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\):\n  \\[\n  y = -1 + \\frac{3}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2} \\times 8\n  \\]\n  - Calculate \\(\\frac{3}{2} \\times 8 = 12\\):\n  \\[\n  y = -1 + \\frac{3}{2}x - 12\n  \\]\n  - Combine the constant terms:\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{3}{2}x - 13\n  \\]\n\n#### Step 4: Confirm Results\n\n- I need to verify that the equation matches our calculations through some sanity checks:\n  - The slope \\(m\\) obtained is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) which is consistent because in parametric, for each \\( t \\), \\(x\\) increases by 2 and \\(y\\) increases by 3, leading to a \\(\\Delta y / \\Delta x = 3/2\\).\n  - The y-intercept \\(b = -13\\), calculated as expected.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- After checking each step repeatedly against potential errors and ensuring arithmetic accuracy, I'm confident the final transformation to slope-intercept form is correct.\n\n- Thus, the ordered pair \\((m, b)\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, -13\\right)}\\).",
