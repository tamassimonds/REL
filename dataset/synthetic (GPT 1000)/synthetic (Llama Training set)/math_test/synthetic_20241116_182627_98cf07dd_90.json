    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see what comes to mind as we work through it.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so we have the congruence equation \\(64x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{66}\\) and we're tasked with finding the number of solutions for \\(x\\) within the range \\(0 < x \\le 100\\). At first glance, this reminds me of modular arithmetic problems where we usually try to simplify or transform the equation. There's a connection here to finding inverses or simplifying coefficients. But, let's take this step by step and see where it leads us.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Congruence**\n\nFirst, it might help to simplify the congruence equation \\(64x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{66}\\). One thing that pops up is the possibility of reducing coefficients using the greatest common divisor (GCD). Let's see if the GCD of 64, 2, and 66 has any useful properties.\n\n**Step 2: Checking the GCD**\n\nCalculate the GCD of 64, 66, and 2:\n- \\(\\text{GCD}(64, 66) = 2\\)\n- \\(\\text{GCD}(2, 66) = 2\\)\n\nHuh, interesting! The common factor here is 2. This means the original equation reduces because 2 divides the entire equation. Let's divide the whole equation by 2:\n\n\\[32x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{33}\\]\n\n**Step 3: Reflecting**\n\nThis step looks promising. Reducing the equation likely simplifies finding solutions for \\(x\\). The new problem is now solving \\(32x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{33}\\).\n\n**Step 4: Solving for Inverses**\n\nHmm, \\(32x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{33}\\) looks like a classic case of finding the multiplicative inverse of 32 modulo 33. The goal is to find an integer \\(x\\) such that:\n\\[32x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{33}\\]\n\nBecause 32 and 33 are coprime (i.e., \\(\\text{GCD}(32, 33) = 1\\)), an inverse exists. Usually, the Extended Euclidean Algorithm helps here, but sometimes trial and error is quicker for small numbers.\n\n**Step 5: Testing Inverses**\n\nLet's see if brute force helps decide what \\(x\\) works.\n1. Compute \\(32 \\times x \\pmod{33}\\) for small \\(x\\).\n2. Find \\(x\\) such that it yields a remainder of 1.\n\nAfter a few calculations, it turns out that:\n\\[32 \\times 32 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{33}\\]\n\nWow! \\(x = 32\\) is indeed our inverse. We now know:\n\n\\[x \\equiv 32 \\pmod{33}\\]\n\n**Step 6: General Solution and Counting**\n\nThe general solution for \\(x\\) based on our inverse is:\n\\[x = 32 + 33k\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is an integer.\n\nTo find how many such solutions exist for \\(0 < x \\le 100\\), we substitute back into the range:\n\\[0 < 32 + 33k \\le 100\\]\n\nRearrange:\n\\[1 \\le 33k \\le 68\\]\n\nDividing through by 33:\n\\[0.03 \\le k \\le 2.06\\]\n\nSince \\(k\\) must be an integer, the possible values for \\(k\\) are 0, 1, and 2.\n\n**Step 7: Solutions Within the Range**\n\nSubstitute back to find \\(x\\) values:\n- \\(k = 0\\), \\(x = 32\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\), \\(x = 65\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\), \\(x = 98\\)\n\nCheck: All values satisfy \\(0 < x \\le 100\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPhew! After breaking it down into steps and exploring the problem from multiple angles, we've calculated that there are three solutions for \\(x\\) in the range given.\n\n**Answer: 3 solutions.**",

  "ground_truth": "We can simplify the congruence as follows: \\begin{align*}\n64x&\\equiv 2\\pmod {66}\\\\\n32x&\\equiv 1\\pmod {33}\\\\\n-x&\\equiv 1\\pmod {33}\\\\\nx&\\equiv -1\\pmod{33}\\\\\nx&\\equiv 32\\pmod{33}.\n\\end{align*} The first few positive solutions to this are $32$, $32+33=65$, $32+2\\cdot 33=98$, after which the solutions are clearly greater than $100$ and so are extraneous. Thus there are $\\boxed{3}$ solutions in the given range."
