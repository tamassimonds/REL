    "working_out": "**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts: The problem provides three equations involving logarithms of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) with constants \\(a\\), 15, and -7. We need to determine the value of \\(a\\).\n\nReflection: I can interpret each equation as a condition on the ratios of the variables, so rewriting the logarithmic expressions using properties of logarithms might help. Logarithm subtraction equates to division: \\(\\log(x/y) = a\\).\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite Logarithmic Equations**\n\n1. \\(\\log x - \\log y = a\\) implies \\(\\log(x/y) = a\\), hence \\(x/y = 10^a\\).\n2. \\(\\log y - \\log z = 15\\) implies \\(\\log(y/z) = 15\\), hence \\(y/z = 10^{15}\\).\n3. \\(\\log z - \\log x = -7\\) implies \\(\\log(z/x) = -7\\), hence \\(z/x = 10^{-7}\\).\n\nConsider that these expressions can be rearranged into a product linking all variables:\n\n- Since \\(x = y \\cdot 10^a\\), substitute into \\(z/x = 10^{-7}\\): \\( z = (y \\cdot 10^a) \\cdot 10^{-7}\\).\n\n**Step 3: Relate All Variables**\n\nChecking consistency, I substitute into each expression to link \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) about each other:\n\n- From \\(y = z \\cdot 10^{15}\\), substituting for \\(z = x \\cdot 10^{7}\\) gives: \\(y = (x \\cdot 10^{7}) \\cdot 10^{15}\\). This simplifies to \\(y = x \\cdot 10^{22}\\).\n  \n- We initially know \\(x/y = 10^a\\), hence substituting gives \\((x / (x \\cdot 10^{22})) = 10^a\\). This simplifies to \\(1/10^{22} = 10^a\\), or \\(a = -22\\).\n\n**Step 4: Verify and Reflect**\n\nReflection: Each step seems logically sound, based on the exponential transformations using logarithm properties. I ended up determining \\(a = -22\\).\n\nTo double-check:\n- \\(x = y \\cdot 10^a\\) was used accurately,\n- For \\(y = x \\cdot 10^{22}\\), \\(x/y = 10^{-22}\\).\n\nAfter validation, the calculated solution for \\(a\\) fits all conditions, confirming that:\n\n**Final Answer**: \\(a = -22\\).\n\nAhh, I see that I have made an error in my previous solution. Let's re-evaluate the given problem with a fresh perspective and integrate new approaches to verify the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Re-evaluating the Problem**\n\nTo revisit, we have:\n- \\(\\log \\frac{x}{y} = a\\)\n- \\(\\log \\frac{y}{z} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\log \\frac{z}{x} = -7\\)\n\nInitially, I focused on manipulating these equations separately. However, let's try another approach to find a more consistent solution by adding these equations together.\n\n**Step 2: Summing the Logarithmic Equations**\n\nLet's add all three equations:\n\\[\n\\log \\frac{x}{y} + \\log \\frac{y}{z} + \\log \\frac{z}{x} = a + 15 - 7\n\\]\n\nUsing the identity for the sum of logarithms, \\(\\log A + \\log B + \\log C = \\log (A \\cdot B \\cdot C)\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\log \\left( \\frac{x}{y} \\cdot \\frac{y}{z} \\cdot \\frac{z}{x} \\right) = a + 8\n\\]\n\nSimplifying inside the logarithm:\n\\[\n\\log (1) = a + 8\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\log(1) = 0\\), this implies:\n\\[\na + 8 = 0 \\quad \\text{so} \\quad a = -8\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Verification and Reflection**\n\nReflecting on this approach, combining all logarithmic equations proved efficient and consistent. By directly applying the sum and product property of logarithms, we ensure that all interdependencies among variables \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are considered into one equation. \n\nGiven this approach, \\(a = -8\\) checks out with each provided equation and aligns with the structure of logarithmic identities. This is a simple yet robust solution that considers all aspects of the given problem.\n\nThus, the correct value of \\(a\\) is \\(\\boxed{-8}\\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's re-evaluate the given problem with a fresh perspective and integrate new approaches to verify the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Re-evaluating the Problem**\n\nInitially, I manipulated the equations separately, but now I will reconsider the relationships among \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) by leveraging the sum of the given logarithmic equations. Let's summarize what we have:\n\n- \\(\\log \\frac{x}{y} = a\\)\n- \\(\\log \\frac{y}{z} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\log \\frac{z}{x} = -7\\)\n\n**Step 2: Summing the Logarithmic Equations**\n\nAdding all three equations together provides a new perspective:\n\\[\n\\log \\frac{x}{y} + \\log \\frac{y}{z} + \\log \\frac{z}{x} = a + 15 - 7\n\\]\n\nUsing the logarithmic identity \\(\\log A + \\log B + \\log C = \\log (A \\cdot B \\cdot C)\\), the left side simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\log \\left( \\frac{x}{y} \\cdot \\frac{y}{z} \\cdot \\frac{z}{x} \\right)\n\\]\n\nThe expression inside the logarithm simplifies as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{y} \\cdot \\frac{y}{z} \\cdot \\frac{z}{x} = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\\[\n\\log(1) = a + 8\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\log(1) = 0\\), it follows that:\n\\[\na + 8 = 0 \\quad \\text{so} \\quad a = -8\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Verification and Reflection**\n\nThis approach naturally embraces the properties of logarithms, ensuring that all dependencies among variables \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are accounted for in one holistic equation. By leveraging the sum and product property, it's clear that \\(\\boxed{-8}\\) satisfies the problem's conditions.\n\nReflecting on this solution, we can see that it aligns with the problem's structure and validates through the consistency of logarithmic identities. By integrating this strategic approach, the solution becomes not only mathematically sound but also simpler and more elegant.",
