    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. When I first read this question, my instinct is to break it down and understand what's being asked: finding the probability that the product of the numbers on the five visible faces of a die is divisible by 6. I know that for a product to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question\n\nThe question involves a standard six-sided die. When tossed, only five faces are visible at any time. The challenge is to ensure that the product of these numbers is divisible by 6.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- The key is the divisibility by 6. We need numbers on the visible sides that have a factor of both 2 and 3.\n- I recall each die face is numbered 1 to 6, and these numbers exhibit different properties like evenness or being multiples of 3.\n- Consider the faces' contributions to divisibility: which numbers on a die provide factors of 2 and 3?\n\n### Step 2: Initial Attempt - Checking for Divisibility\n\n**Strategy Thoughts:**\n- A product is divisible by 6 if it includes at least one even number (for divisibility by 2) and at least one multiple of 3.\n- Numbers on a die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Here, even numbers are 2, 4, 6, and multiples of 3 are 3, 6.\n- I need to ensure there's at least one even number and one multiple of 3 among the five visible dice numbers.\n\nLet me try this:\n- If the bottom number is odd (1, 3, 5):\n  - remaining numbers: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} for 1\n  - remaining numbers: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6} for 3\n  - remaining numbers: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6} for 5\n- Hmm, let me pause here. When I list them, I see cases where we can get both an even and a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 3: Examine Other Combinations\n\n- Bottom face is even (2, 4, 6):\n  - Other scenarios:\n    - 2: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n    - 4: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}\n    - 6: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nEach scenario allows us at least one multiple of 3 and one even number. For example, the number 6 itself is both. If 6 is on the bottom, I still have even numbers like 2, 4, and multiples of 3 like 3 on top. \n\n### Step 4: Validate Approach\n\n**Checking Thoughts:**\n- Need to see cases when it fails, so I don't miss anything.\n- Realizing that with one die number hidden, there\u2019s always enough odds to have both condition allies present in visible numbers on a fair six-sided die.\n- Total possible cases: 6 (one for each potential bottom face).\n- Valid configurations: I feel all configurations are valid because at least one even number and a multiple of 3 always appear based on analysis.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude\n\nCalculating from steps above, out of 6 configurations analyzed, all ensured divisibility by 6 of the visible numbers' product.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- Each configuration preserved at least one even number and one multiple of 3, confirming the product\u2019s divisibility by 6.\n- Probability: Since every possible bottom face allows for a valid product, probability = 1 or 100%.\n\nThis feels correct, considering the operational properties of dice faces. I\u2019m confident in this conclusion after evaluating each die configuration.",

  "ground_truth": "If 6 is one of the visible faces, the product will be divisible by 6.  If 6 is not visible, the product of the visible faces will be $1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 120$, which is also divisible by 6.  Because the product is always divisible by 6, the probability is $\\boxed{1}$."
