    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We need to find the average of all positive integers that are represented with three digits in base 5 and two digits in base 8. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Base Conditions\nFirst, let's understand what it means to have three digits in base 5 and two digits in base 8.\n\n**Base 5 Condition:**\n- A three-digit number in base 5 ranges from \\(100_5\\) to \\(444_5\\).\n- In decimal (base 10), \\(100_5 = 1 \\times 5^2 = 25\\) and \\(444_5 = 4 \\times 5^2 + 4 \\times 5^1 + 4 \\times 5^0 = 124\\).\n- So these numbers range from 25 to 124 when converted to base 10.\n\n**Base 8 Condition:**\n- A two-digit number in base 8 ranges from \\(10_8\\) to \\(77_8\\).\n- In decimal, \\(10_8 = 1 \\times 8^1 = 8\\) and \\(77_8 = 7 \\times 8^1 + 7 \\times 8^0 = 63\\).\n- So these numbers range from 8 to 63 in decimal.\n\n### Step 2: Finding the Overlapping Range\nWe need numbers that meet both criteria simultaneously, which means we need to find the intersection of the two ranges calculated above: [25, 124] from base 5 and [8, 63] from base 8.\n\nThe overlapping range in decimal is from 25 to 63, since this is where the two ranges intersect.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Average\nWe now need to calculate the average of all integers from 25 to 63.\n\n1. **Determine Count of Numbers:**  \n   The count of integers from 25 to 63 is \\(63 - 25 + 1 = 39\\).\n\n2. **Sum of the Numbers:**  \n   Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})\n   \\]\n   where \\(n\\) is the number of terms.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{39}{2} \\times (25 + 63) = \\frac{39}{2} \\times 88\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying the Sum:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = 39 \\times 44 = 1716\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Average:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Sum}}{\\text{Number of Terms}} = \\frac{1716}{39} = 44\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Verification\nLet's perform a quick sanity check:\n- The arithmetic mean formula is applied correctly given the range.\n- Checking a few sample numbers: Is 44 between 25 and 63? Yes, and it falls in the middle of our range.\n\n### Conclusion\nHence, the average of all positive integers that have three digits in base 5 and two digits in base 8 is **44** when written in base 10.",

  "ground_truth": "If an integer $n$ has three digits in base $5$, then $5^2\\le n<5^3$. If an integer $n$ has two digits in base $8$, then $8^1\\le n<8^2$. The overlap of these intervals is $$\\{25,26,27,28,\\ldots,61,62,63\\}.$$The average of the integers in this set is $\\frac{25+63}{2} = \\boxed{44}$."
