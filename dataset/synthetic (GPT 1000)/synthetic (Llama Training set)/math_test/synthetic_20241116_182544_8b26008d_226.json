    "working_out": "**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so we have a hyperbola with given asymptotes and a point it passes through. We need to find the distance between its foci. It's been a while since I tackled hyperbolas, but this seems like a standard problem. Asymptotes provide the direction and sometimes even the orientation of a hyperbola. I need to recall how a hyperbola is defined and how it makes use of asymptotes.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- The asymptotes of a hyperbola are lines that the two branches of the hyperbola approach but never touch.\n- For hyperbolas centered at some point (h, k), the equations for asymptotes are generally given by either:\n  - \\(y - k = \\pm \\frac{b}{a}(x - h)\\) for a east-west opening hyperbola, or\n  - \\(y - k = \\pm \\frac{a}{b}(x - h)\\) for a north-south opening hyperbola.\n- The given asymptotes are \\(y = 2x - 3\\) and \\(y = 17 - 2x\\). I suspect this hyperbola's center isn't at the origin, and I need to find this center.\n\n**Identifying the Center:**\n\nInteresting, the slopes of the asymptotes are +2 and -2, which suggests symmetry about the x-axis. I recall that the center lies at the intersection of the asymptotes:\n- Setting the equations equal to each other to find the center:\n  \\[\n  2x - 3 = 17 - 2x\n  \\]\n  Solving gives:\n  \\[\n  4x = 20 \\implies x = 5\n  \\]\n  Substituting for \\(y\\):\n  \\[\n  y = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7\n  \\]\n  So, the center is at (5, 7). This makes the midpoint of 5 and 7 crucial for the geometry of the hyperbola!\n\n**Re-evaluate:**\n\nLet\u2019s be sure this asymptote makes sense. Hmm, both \\(y = 2x - 3\\) and \\(y = 17 - 2x\\) intersect at (5, 7). Good start!\n\n**Equation of the Hyperbola:**\n\nSince the asymptotes are perpendicular and through (5,7), the hyperbola likely opens east-west or north-south. In this case, based on asymptotes:\n- Transverse axis is horizontal, so \\(\\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\\).\n- With center (5,7), it adjusts to \\(\\frac{(x - 5)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y - 7)^2}{(2a)^2} = 1\\).\n\n**Substituting the Known Point:**\n\nThe hyperbola passes through (4, 7), so substituting:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(4 - 5)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(7 - 7)^2}{(2a)^2} = 1 \\implies \\frac{1}{a^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(a = 1\\).\n\n**Determining the Foci:**\n\nFrom \\(a = 1\\), now calculate \\(b\\) using the relation: The asymptote is in the form \\(b/a = 2 \\implies b = 2a = 2\\).\n\n- The hyperbola equation is now simplified to:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(x - 5)^2}{1^2} - \\frac{(y - 7)^2}{2^2} = 1\n  \\]\n\nThe distance between the foci of a hyperbola is: \\(2c\\), where \\(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\\).\n\nLet\u2019s compute \\(c\\):\n\\[\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \\implies c = \\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nSo, distance between the foci: \\(2c = 2\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n**Final Reflection & Answer:**\n\nEverything seems aligned: equations check out and no glaring directional mishaps. Answer primarily driven from geometry agreements through given condition:\n- The distance between the foci comes out to be:\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}\n  \\]",

  "ground_truth": "The intersection of the asymptotes is $(5,7),$ so this is the center of the hyperbola.  Since the slopes of the asymptotes are $\\pm 2,$ the equation of the hyperbola can be written in the form\n\\[(x - 5)^2 - \\frac{(y - 7)^2}{4} = d\\]for some constant $d.$  Setting $x = 4$ and $y = 7,$ we get $d = 1,$ so the equation is\n\\[\\frac{(x - 5)^2}{1} - \\frac{(y - 7)^2}{4} = 1.\\]Then $a^2 = 1$ and $b^2 = 4,$ so $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 5,$ which means $c = \\sqrt{5}.$  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = \\boxed{2 \\sqrt{5}}.$"
