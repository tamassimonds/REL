    "working_out": "Great, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step while documenting my thoughts and calculations.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nMary has 6 identical basil plants and 3 different window sills. Our goal is to figure out how many ways she can distribute these plants among the three window sills. The plants are identical, so switching plants between the same two sills does not create a new arrangement.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n**1. Combinatorial Distribution Approach:**\n\n- This is a classic stars and bars problem where we need to distribute indistinguishable items (plants) into distinguishable bins (window sills).\n\n**2. Systematic Listing:**\n\n- Attempting to list combinations, but with 6 plants and 3 sills, this might get cumbersome.\n\n**3. Generating Functions:**\n\n- A more mathematical approach using generating functions, but I suspect stars and bars will be simpler.\n\n#### Initial Thoughts:\n\nMy first thought is to use the stars and bars method, which I've encountered before in similar problems about distributing items into bins. This method involves calculating the number of ways to place \"dividers\" among the items to separate them into groups.\n\n### Stars and Bars Method\n\n**Step 1: Visualizing the Problem**\n\nWe need to distribute 6 identical plants (`* * * * * *`) into 3 different window sills. We can use 2 bars to create heads between these window sills, like this: `* * | * * * | *`.\n\n**Step 2: Formula Application**\n\nThe number of ways to arrange n stars and k-1 bars (dividers) is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[ C(n + k - 1, k - 1) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the number of identical items (here, plants), and\n- \\( k \\) is the number of bins (here, window sills).\n\nHere, \\( n = 6 \\) (plants), and \\( k = 3 \\) (window sills).\n\n**Step 3: Application of the Formula**\n\n\\[ C(6 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(8, 2) \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Combination**\n\n\\[ C(8, 2) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8 - 2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28 \\]\n\nThere are 28 ways to distribute 6 identical plants among 3 distinct window sills.\n\n### Reflection\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? The stars and bars approach assumes that the plants are indistinguishable and the sills are distinguishable, which fits the problem\u2019s description. \n\n**Quick Verification:** Consider smaller numbers to ensure the logic holds: \n- If there were 3 plants and 2 window sills (stars = 3, bars = 1):\n  \\[ C(3+2-1, 2-1) = C(4, 1) = 4 \\]\n  - Listing: \\{3,0\\}, \\{2,1\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{0,3\\}, which matches the expected output.\n\nThis verification gives me confidence that the process was correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe answer is that there are 28 ways for Mary to put her 6 identical basil plants on the 3 different window sills.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the plants are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of plants on each window sill.\n\nIf all the plants are on one window  sill, there are $3$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $5$ plants are on one window sill and the last is on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants go on which window sill.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are each on one of the other windows, there are $3$ ways to choose which window the $4$ plants are on.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window and the other $3$ plants are all on another window, there are $3$ ways to choose which window has no plants.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window, $2$ plants on another window, and $1$ plant on the last window, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants are on which windows.\n\nIf $2$ plants are on each window, there is only one way to arrange them.\n\nIn total, there are $3+6+6+3+3+6+1=\\boxed{28}$ ways to arrange the plants on the window sills.\n\nSee if you can find a faster way to do this problem by considering lining up the plants, and placing two dividers among the plants to separate them into three groups corresponding to the sills."
