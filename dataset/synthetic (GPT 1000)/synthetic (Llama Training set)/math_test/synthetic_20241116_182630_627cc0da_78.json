    "working_out": "First, let me really understand what\u2019s being asked here. I\u2019m supposed to find how many unique values can be created by forming the fraction \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\) where \\(x\\) is either 4, 8, or 12 and \\(y\\) is also 4, 8, or 12. Okay, so for this problem, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are independent of each other, which means I need to consider all possible combinations of these values.\n\nInitial thoughts: Since I\u2019m looking at forming fractions, I need to calculate \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\) for all possible combinations, and then find out how many of these results are unique. \n\nLet me brainstorm a strategy. I can list all combinations, calculate each fraction, and then check how many different results I get. This means:\n\n1. Make a list of all possible \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\) combinations.\n2. Calculate each \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\).\n3. Collect all unique results.\n\nOkay, let's go through this:\n\n1. **List all possible fractions \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\):**\n\n   - If \\(x = 4\\):\n     - \\(\\frac{4}{4} = 1\\)\n     - \\(\\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n     - \\(\\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n  \n   - If \\(x = 8\\):\n     - \\(\\frac{8}{4} = 2\\)\n     - \\(\\frac{8}{8} = 1\\)\n     - \\(\\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n   - If \\(x = 12\\):\n     - \\(\\frac{12}{4} = 3\\)\n     - \\(\\frac{12}{8} = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n     - \\(\\frac{12}{12} = 1\\)\n\nHmm, at a glance, I notice some repeats like \\(\\frac{4}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{8}{8}\\), and \\(\\frac{12}{12}\\) all result in 1. I\u2019ll list each result and keep track of which ones I've seen already.\n\n2. **Calculate unique results:**\n\n   The fractions I have are:\n\n   - 1\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n   - 2\n   - \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n   - 3\n   - \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\)\n   \n3. **Review and check for uniqueness:**\n\n   Let\u2019s write these results in simplest form if they aren\u2019t already, and ensure none are the same when considered as fractions:\n\n   - 1\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n   - 2\n   - \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n   - 3\n   - \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\)\n\nI can see now, the distinct values are: 1, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), 2, \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), 3, and \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nLet me count these: 1, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), 2, \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), 3, \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) which totals 7 unique values.\n\nFinal thought: The problem turned out to be quite straightforward. I checked and doubled-checked the arithmetic and simplification of each fraction and found 7 unique values. This seems to fit the context of the problem well. If I was originally unsure, I can run through the calculations or adjustments to form each value again, but listing them and recognizing repeats seemed convincing enough. \n\nAnswer: The number of unique values that can be formed is \\(7\\).",
