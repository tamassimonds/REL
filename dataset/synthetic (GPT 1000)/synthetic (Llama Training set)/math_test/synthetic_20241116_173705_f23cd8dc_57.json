  "problem": "Billy shoots an arrow from 10 feet above the ground. The height of this arrow can be expressed by the equation $h=10-23t-10t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds since the arrow was shot. If the center of a target is raised 5 feet off the ground, in how many seconds must the arrow reach the target in order for Billy to hit the bulls eye?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. The problem is asking at how many seconds after the time of shooting will the arrow hit the target that is at 5 feet elevation. We have the equation of the arrow\u2019s height with respect to time, \\( h(t) = 10 - 23t - 10t^2 \\), and we are given that the target\u2019s center is 5 feet above the ground.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze What is Given and What is Needed**\n\n- We start with the height equation, \\( h = 10 - 23t - 10t^2 \\).\n- The height of the upper portion of the bullseye (target center) is 5 feet.\n  \nWe need to find the time \\( t \\) for when the height \\( h(t) \\) is 5 feet. So, we should solve the equation \\( 10 - 23t - 10t^2 = 5 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Simplifying the Equation**\n\nLet's start by simplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ \n10 - 23t - 10t^2 = 5 \n\\]\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[ \n10 - 5 - 23t - 10t^2 = 0 \n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \n5 - 23t - 10t^2 = 0 \n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s rearrange it as a standard quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ \n-10t^2 - 23t + 5 = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\nOh! I remember my algebra classes. We need to solve for \\( t \\). Usually, I would solve this using the quadratic formula, \\( t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = -10 \\), \\( b = -23 \\), and \\( c = 5 \\).\n\nWork through the formula step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate the discriminant: \\( b^2 - 4ac \\).\n\n   \\[\n   (-23)^2 - 4(-10)(5) = 529 + 200 = 729\n   \\]\n\nThe discriminant is 729, which is a perfect square! \\( \\sqrt{729} = 27 \\).\n\n2. Solve with the quadratic formula:\n\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{-(-23) \\pm 27}{2(-10)}\n   \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{23 \\pm 27}{-20}\n   \\]\n\nThis leads to two possible solutions:\n\n- \\( t = \\frac{23 + 27}{-20} = \\frac{50}{-20} = -2.5 \\) which doesn't make sense in our physical scenario as time cannot be negative.\n  \n- \\( t = \\frac{23 - 27}{-20} = \\frac{-4}{-20} = 0.2 \\)\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the Results**\n\nThe viable solution is \\( t = 0.2 \\) seconds. This seems reasonable given the situation: the arrow was shot, and after 0.2 seconds, it reached the target's height of 5 feet.\n\n**Step 5: Verification**\n\nLet\u2019s do a quick verification to ensure our calculations are correct. We substitute \\( t = 0.2 \\) back into the height equation:\n\n   \\[\n   h(0.2) = 10 - 23(0.2) - 10(0.2)^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 10 - 4.6 - 0.4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 5\n   \\]\n\nPerfect! The calculations check out and confirm that the arrow reaches a height of 5 feet precisely at \\( t = 0.2 \\) seconds.\n\nMy initial intuition about dealing with this as a quadratic problem was correct, and I\u2019m happy with the result. If anything felt off during the process, I would have re-evaluated the steps\u2014particularly ensuring the discriminant calculation was precise.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the center of the target is 5 feet above the ground, $h=5$. So we get the quadratic: \\begin{align*}5& =10-23t-10t^{2}\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0& =10t^{2}+23t-5\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=(2t+5)(5t-1).\n\\end{align*}Thus, the values of $t$ that satisfy the equation are $-\\frac52$ and $\\frac15$. However, since time can never be a negative number, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{5}}$."
