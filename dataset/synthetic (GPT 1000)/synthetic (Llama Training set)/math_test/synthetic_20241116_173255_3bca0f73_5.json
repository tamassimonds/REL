    "working_out": "Alright, let's jump into solving the equation \\(\\tan x = \\sin x\\) for \\(0 \\le x \\le 2\\pi\\).\n\n**First Thoughts and Brainstorming:**\n\n- When I first see \\(\\tan x = \\sin x\\), I think about the definitions of these functions. \\(\\tan x\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\\), so we're dealing with trigonometric identities and possibly intersections.\n- This reminds me of solving equations where two functions are set equal and we're looking for their intersections on a given interval. A common approach is to rewrite one function in terms of the other if possible.\n\n**Let's break this down step by step.**\n\n1. **Equation Manipulation:**\n\n   Start by considering the identity for \\(\\tan x\\):\n   \\[\n   \\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}\n   \\]\n\n   So, substitute this into the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} = \\sin x\n   \\]\n\n2. **Isolating Terms:**\n\n   To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by \\(\\cos x\\) (assuming \\(\\cos x \\neq 0\\) initially):\n   \\[\n   \\sin x = \\sin x \\cdot \\cos x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rearranging:**\n\n   Subtract \\(\\sin x \\cdot \\cos x\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   \\sin x - \\sin x \\cdot \\cos x = 0\n   \\]\n\n   Factor out \\(\\sin x\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sin x (1 - \\cos x) = 0\n   \\]\n\n   Okay, now I have a product of terms equaling zero, which is promising because it leads to possible solutions:\n   - \\(\\sin x = 0\\)\n   - \\(1 - \\cos x = 0\\) which simplifies to \\(\\cos x = 1\\)\n\n4. **Solving \\(\\sin x = 0\\):**\n\n   Looking for where \\(\\sin x = 0\\) within \\(0 \\le x \\le 2\\pi\\):\n   - \\(\\sin x = 0\\) at \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = \\pi\\), and \\(x = 2\\pi\\).\n\n5. **Solving \\(\\cos x = 1\\):**\n\n   \\(\\cos x = 1\\) within \\(0 \\le x \\le 2\\pi\\):\n   - \\(\\cos x = 1\\) only at \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 2\\pi\\).\n\n6. **Checking Intervals:**\n   - It looks like we've found points: \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = \\pi\\), and \\(x = 2\\pi\\).\n\n**Checking the solutions:**\n\n- Plugging these values back into the original equation \\(\\tan x = \\sin x\\):\n  - For \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 2\\pi\\), \\(\\tan x\\) and \\(\\sin x\\) both equal zero, so both sides of the equation are equal.\n  - For \\(x = \\pi\\), \\(\\tan x = \\sin(\\pi) = 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\pi) = 0\\), so the equation holds.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter re-evaluating possible solutions and considering the constraints of the functions, the solutions are:\n\\[\nx = 0, \\pi, 2\\pi\n\\]\n\nI've verified that these solutions work by plugging them back into the original equation. Everything checks out. Feels good to have nailed down those satisfying points of intersection.",
