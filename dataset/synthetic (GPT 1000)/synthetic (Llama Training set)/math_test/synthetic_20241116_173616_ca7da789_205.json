    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We have a complex equality involving \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{x} = \\frac{y}{3} = \\frac{x}{y}\n\\]\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nThis looks like a system of equations where each part equals a common ratio. Let's denote this common ratio as \\( k \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{x} = k, \\quad \\frac{y}{3} = k, \\quad \\frac{x}{y} = k\n\\]\n\nAlready, I'm thinking I need to express \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in terms of this \\( k \\). Here's how I can start:\n\n### Step 1: Solving each equation\n\n1. From \\( \\frac{2}{x} = k \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{2}{k}\n   \\]\n2. From \\( \\frac{y}{3} = k \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   y = 3k\n   \\]\n3. From \\( \\frac{x}{y} = k \\), this gives me:\n   \\[\n   x = ky\n   \\]\n\nLet's pause here and see if these work together. I can substitute the expressions for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) from equations 1 and 2 into equation 3, and check for consistency.\n\n### Step 2: Substituting expressions\n\nSubstitute \\( x = \\frac{2}{k} \\) and \\( y = 3k \\) into \\( x = ky \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{k} = k(3k)\n\\]\n\nSimplify this:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{k} = 3k^2\n\\]\n\nBy multiplying both sides by \\( k \\) to clear the fraction:\n\\[\n2 = 3k^3\n\\]\n\nThis is a simple equation in \\( k \\):\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( k \\)\n\nDividing both sides by 3 gives:\n\\[\nk^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nTaking the cube root:\n\\[\nk = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{2}{3}}\n\\]\n\nNow I can calculate \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) using this value of \\( k \\):\n\n### Step 4: Calculate \\( x \\)\n\nUsing \\( x = \\frac{2}{k} \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{2}{3}}}\n\\]\n\nI recognize this as the reciprocal of \\( k \\). Since \\( k^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\), it follows that the cube of \\( x \\) will cancel out the constant:\n\nLet's cube both sides:\n\\[\nx^3 = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{2}{3}}}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8}{\\frac{2}{3}} = 8 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 12\n\\]\n\nOh! That was slightly tricky! Cubing the reciprocal, the constants cancel nicely:\n\nFinally:\n\\[\nx^3 = 12\n\\]\n\n### Reflection and Verification\n\nThis makes sense intuitively because by representing everything in terms of a common ratio and using consistent operations, I can rely on all the transformations being accurate.\n\nLet's double-check if the operations make sense:\n- Calculation of each variable relative to \\( k \\)\n- Use of properties like reciprocals and cubing \n\nYes, the approach validates back to our given conditions. So, \\( x^3 = \\boxed{12} \\) is indeed the correct and consistent solution.",
