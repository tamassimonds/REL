    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by understanding the sequence defined here, checking conditions, brainstorming potential approaches, and adjusting the course as necessary.\n\n### Initial Step: Understanding the Sequence\n\n1. **Definition of the Sequence**: We are dealing with a sequence $(a_n)$ where it's defined that:\n   - $a_1 = 1$\n   - $a_2 = 2$\n   - The recurrence relation is given by: \n     \\[ a_n^2 - a_{n - 1} a_{n + 1} = 1 \\]\n     for all $n \\geq 2$.\n\n2. **Initial Observations**:\n   - This relation feels similar to some transformations or Pell-like equations.\n   - I notice the form reminds me of continued fractions for square roots or some form of relation like Fibonacci-type sequences.\n   - I expect this might be potentially related to some well-known recursive sequences or it might simplify in some surprising way.\n\n### Step 2: Concrete Steps - Analyze the Recurrence\n\n3. **First Few Terms**:\n   - Let's compute a few initial terms to see if a pattern emerges.\n   - For $n = 2$: \n     \\[ a_2^2 - a_1 a_3 = 1 \\]\n     \\[ 2^2 - 1 \\cdot a_3 = 1 \\]\n     \\[ 4 - a_3 = 1 \\Rightarrow a_3 = 3 \\]\n\n   - For $n = 3$:\n     \\[ a_3^2 - a_2 a_4 = 1 \\]\n     \\[ 3^2 - 2 \\cdot a_4 = 1 \\]\n     \\[ 9 - 2a_4 = 1 \\Rightarrow 2a_4 = 8 \\Rightarrow a_4 = 4 \\]\n\n   - For $n = 4$:\n     \\[ a_4^2 - a_3 a_5 = 1 \\]\n     \\[ 4^2 - 3 \\cdot a_5 = 1 \\]\n     \\[ 16 - 3a_5 = 1 \\Rightarrow 3a_5 = 15 \\Rightarrow a_5 = 5 \\]\n   \n4. **Identifying a Pattern**:\n   - After computing a few terms, I noticed: $a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 3, a_4 = 4, a_5 = 5$.\n   - This hints at the possibility that $a_n = n$. Need to prove this works for all $n$.\n\n### Step 3: Induction Approach\n\n5. **Inductive Hypothesis**:\n   - Assume $a_k = k$ for all $k$ up to some $n$.\n   - Show it holds for $k = n+1$.\n\n6. **Inductive Step**:\n   - Consider $a_n^2 - a_{n-1} a_{n+1} = 1$\n   - If our hypothesis is correct, then $a_n = n$ and $a_{n-1} = n-1$.\n   - Substitute into the recurrence: \n     \\[ n^2 - (n-1) a_{n+1} = 1 \\]\n     \\[ n^2 - n a_{n+1} + a_{n+1} = 1 \\]\n     \\[ (n - 1)a_{n+1} = n^2 - 1 \\]\n     \\[ (n - 1)a_{n+1} = (n+1)(n-1) \\]\n     \\[ a_{n+1} = n+1 \\]\n   - This confirms our hypothesis works for $n+1$ assuming it holds up to $n$.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - By induction, $a_n = n$ for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\n### Final Step: Solve the Problem\n\n8. **Find $a_{100}$**:\n   - Hence, $a_{100} = 100$ based on our finding that $a_n = n$ for all natural $n$.\n\n### Reflection\n\n9. **Check Completion**:\n   - Each step checks out logically and numerically.\n   - The simplicity of $a_n = n$ fits both the recurrence relation and the base conditions.\n   - The whole induction process has been verified with no contradictions.\n\nThis was an exploration into identifying patterns and confirming them through mathematical induction!",
