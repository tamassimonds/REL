    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- At first glance, I see that the question is asking for the positive square root of the product of three numbers: 10, 15, and 24. It feels like a straightforward calculation of the product followed by taking the square root.\n- However, I also remember that breaking down numbers into factors might be helpful, especially with squareroots. This is starting to remind me of simplifying radicals. Hmm, maybe there\u2019s a way to simplify things before multiplying all the numbers together.\n\nStep 1: Understanding the Product\n- Before jumping to the multiplication, let's brainstorm possible approaches here. One way would, of course, be multiplying all the numbers directly and proceeding from there. However, that might become cumbersome, especially if the product is large. Another approach here is to factor each of these numbers and potentially see common squares. \n- This problem is somewhat similar to problems I\u2019ve seen where factoring first simplifies the later steps. Let\u2019s try breaking the numbers down:\n  - 10 can be factored into \\(2 \\times 5\\)\n  - 15 can be factored into \\(3 \\times 5\\)\n  - 24 can be factored into \\(2^3 \\times 3\\). \n- Wait, hold on. I see that breaking the numbers down could indeed make it easier if we decide to find pairs. I'm curious if there are common pairs that could map simply to their square roots.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the Product\n- Let's start calculating the product \\(10 \\times 15 \\times 24\\). To make it a bit manageable, I'll try multiplying in parts, but wait, didn't I already plan a breaking down approach? Let's exploit the prime factorizations here:\n  - The combined prime factorization would be: \n    \\[\n    2 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 2^3 \\times 3 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2\n    \\]\n- Looks like I've found some pairs, useful for extracting square roots later.\n\nStep 3: Square Root of the Product\n- Now to take the square root: \n  - The expression \\(2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2\\) can be rewritten as: \n    \\[\n    (2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5)^2\n    \\]\n  - That\u2019s perfect. I see that this can easily be simplified by taking the square root.\n    - The square root of each component: \n      - \\(\\sqrt{2^4} = 2^2 = 4\\)\n      - \\(\\sqrt{3^2} = 3\\)\n      - \\(\\sqrt{5^2} = 5\\)\n    - So, the product would be \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 5\\).\n- I need to calculate this:\n  - \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\)\n  - \\(12 \\times 5 = 60\\)\n\nReflection:\n- Let\u2019s double-check:  \n  - I simplified \\(2^4\\) to \\(2^2\\) and similarly  \\(3^2\\) and \\(5^2\\), calculating their square roots separately, which seems correctly handled.\n- Since it all feels right, let\u2019s confirm the answer:\n  - The positive square root of the original product is \\(60\\).\n\nTherefore, after checking and reflecting, I\u2019m confident the answer is 60.",
