    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: When I see this problem, the first thing that comes to mind is that we're dealing with a circle. The endpoints of a diameter are given, so this should help us find the center of the circle. The equation for the midpoint of a line segment should be key here since the center of the circle will be the midpoint of the diameter.\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of the coordinates of the center. So, I'm thinking that once we find the center, we'll add its x and y coordinates together to get our final answer.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategy\n\n1. **Use the Midpoint Formula:** The center of the circle should be the midpoint of these two points, \\((7, -6)\\) and \\((-3, -4)\\). The midpoint formula will help us find the coordinates of the center.\n\n2. **Verify by Concept:** We know a diameter bisects exactly in half, so using the midpoint makes sense conceptually. It's almost like checking by imaging or drawing it out if unsure.\n\nLet's start with those two ideas and see if the calculations support it.\n\n### Applying the Midpoint Formula\n\nThe midpoint \\((x_{\\text{mid}}, y_{\\text{mid}})\\) of a segment with endpoints \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nx_{\\text{mid}} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\quad y_{\\text{mid}} = \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\n\\]\n\n#### Calculating \\(x_{\\text{mid}}\\):\n\n- The x-coordinates of our points are 7 and -3.\n- Using the formula: \n\n\\[\nx_{\\text{mid}} = \\frac{7 + (-3)}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\nHmm, that seems reasonable. Let's move to the y-coordinates next.\n\n#### Calculating \\(y_{\\text{mid}}\\):\n\n- The y-coordinates are -6 and -4.\n- Using the formula:\n\n\\[\ny_{\\text{mid}} = \\frac{-6 + (-4)}{2} = \\frac{-10}{2} = -5\n\\]\n\nBoth of these seem to fall in line with what I'd expect. Let's check our understanding quickly with basic reasoning:\n\n- The midpoint lies directly between the two endpoints. Given that both x-values add to 4 and y-values add to \\(-10\\), dividing by 2 balances the two sides, confirming we're getting the right midpoint/coordinate pair.\n\n### Finding the Sum of the Coordinates\n\nNow that we have our center as (2, -5), the problem asks for the sum of the x and y coordinates.\n\n- Sum = \\(2 + (-5) = -3\\)\n\nOkay, that makes sense. Let's just check to make sure there's no oversights:\n\n### Quick Review\n\n- We used the midpoint formula correctly.\n- Logical steps appear to confirm coordinates calculations.\n- Summing the coordinates was straightforward.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is \\(-3\\). This method feels solid regarding how we've used the midpoint formula and verified the approach conceptually.\n\nThat should confidently be the final answer: \\(-3\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The midpoint of a circle's diameter is its center. Thus, the center of the circle is at $\\left(\\frac{7+(-3)}{2},\\frac{-6+(-4)}{2}\\right)=(2,-5)$. The sum of the coordinates of this point is $2+(-5)=\\boxed{-3}$."
