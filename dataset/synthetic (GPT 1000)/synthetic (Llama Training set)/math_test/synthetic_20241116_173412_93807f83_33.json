    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, we have the two given ratios:\n- \\(\\frac{x}{y} = 2\\)\n- \\(\\frac{z}{x} = 4\\)\n\nWe need to find the value of \\(\\frac{z}{y}\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nThis looks similar to a problem where we might need to link or transform ratios. The question is asking for \\(\\frac{z}{y}\\), which means expressing \\(z\\) in terms of \\(y\\). We have two intermediate ratios given, so there must be a way to connect these fractions.\n\n### Exploring Different Strategies\n\n1. **Substitution:**\n   We could express one variable in terms of another using the given ratios. For example:\n   \\[\n   x = 2y \\quad (\\text{from } \\frac{x}{y} = 2)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   z = 4x \\quad (\\text{from } \\frac{z}{x} = 4)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subsequent Substitution:**\n   After substituting for \\(x\\) and \\(z\\), substitute in sequence to find a connection between \\(z\\) and \\(y\\).\n   - Since \\(x = 2y\\), substitute this into the expression for \\(z\\):\n     \\[\n     z = 4x = 4(2y) = 8y\n     \\]\n\n3. **Finding \\(\\frac{z}{y}\\):**\n   Now we express \\(\\frac{z}{y}\\) using our expression for \\(z\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{z}{y} = \\frac{8y}{y} = 8\n   \\]\n\n### Check and Reflection\n\n- Let's consider if these steps could lead to any mistakes. We substituted for \\(x\\) and it led to a straightforward pathway.\n- Check if numerically this makes sense. \\(\\frac{x}{y} = 2\\) satisfied by \\(x = 2y\\) which is correct, and \\(\\frac{z}{x} = 4\\) satisfied by \\(z = 8y\\), also correct when \\(x = 2y\\).\n\nBy reflecting on this, everything aligns and appears reasonable given our substitutions and operations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe value of \\(\\frac{z}{y}\\) is \\(8\\). This methodical approach, substituting step by step and checking our work, leads us to confidently conclude that \\(\\frac{z}{y} = 8\\).",
