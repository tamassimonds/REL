    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem. We're dealing with quarters and their height and we want to find out how many are needed for a stack one foot high.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - We have a stack of 8 quarters that makes up half an inch in height.\n   - We need to make a stack that is 1 foot high.\n   - A foot is 12 inches. \n\n2. **Initial Strategy**: \n   - Convert the height from feet to inches because we know the height of the quarters in inches.\n   - Determine how many quarters make one inch first, then scale up to find how many make a foot.\n\n### Exploring Solutions\n\n1. **Convert Feet to Inches**:\n   - First, let's understand what a foot means here. 1 foot = 12 inches.\n   - So, our goal is to make the stack 12 inches high.\n\n2. **Determine Quarters per Inch**: \n   - We're told that 8 quarters make half an inch.\n   - So, if 8 quarters = 0.5 inch, we need to find out how many quarters are in 1 inch.\n   - This is a simple doubling because 0.5 inch \u00d7 2 = 1 inch.\n   - Therefore, we need \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\) quarters to make 1 inch.\n\n3. **Calculate Quarters Needed for One Foot**:\n   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, and we need 16 quarters per inch:\n   - Total quarters needed = \\(16\\ \\text{quarters/inch} \\times 12\\ \\text{inches} = 192\\ \\text{quarters}\\).\n\n### Reflections and Checks\n\n- **Quick Check**: Let's check if multiplying by 2 in step 2 was correct. Since 8 quarters covered 0.5 inches, it feels reasonable that we'd need twice as many for a full inch. The math checks out.\n- **Does the Final Result Make Sense?**: Calculating 16 quarters per inch feels logical based on how the problem is set up. Since we're then multiplying by 12 inches, the final count of 192 quarters doesn\u2019t seem too big or too small.\n- **Reflect on the Method**: Starting by understanding quarters per inch allowed us to straightforwardly calculate back up to a foot without unnecessary complexity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter considering the problem, breaking it down into parts, and double-checking each step, it definitely seems like 192 quarters are necessary to reach a height of one foot. The procedure feels solid, and the calculations have been reviewed. It seems like this strategy was pretty efficient. \n\nIs there another simpler or more intuitive way? Perhaps by visual confirmation (like stacking real quarters), but mathematically, this is quite clear-cut.",

  "ground_truth": "There are $12$ inches in a foot, so we can convert the units by multiplying ratios. $$\\frac{8 \\text{ quarters}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ inch}}\\times\\frac{12 \\text{ inches}}{1 \\text{ foot}}=\\frac{96}{\\frac12}=192 \\text{ quarters per foot}$$ A stack one foot high consists of $\\boxed{192}$ quarters."
