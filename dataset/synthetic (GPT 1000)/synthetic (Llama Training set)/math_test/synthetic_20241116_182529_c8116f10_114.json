    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and work through it step by step.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I notice that it involves determinants of matrices, specifically the products of two matrices, \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\). I'm immediately reminded that there are some properties of determinants that could be helpful here. One key property is that the determinant of a product of matrices is the product of the determinants of the matrices. \n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n    - We know \\(\\det \\mathbf{A} = -7\\) and \\(\\det \\mathbf{B} = 3\\).\n    - We are asked to find \\(\\det (\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{A})\\).\n\n2. **Exploring Strategies:**\n    - Use properties of determinants: Specifically, the property that \\(\\det(\\mathbf{XY}) = \\det(\\mathbf{X}) \\cdot \\det(\\mathbf{Y})\\).\n\nReflecting on this, I think this property could directly give us the solution without complex calculations. However, let's be sure this property applies here in its simplest form. We should check if there's anything additional to consider, although it seems straightforward.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Apply the Property:**\n    Given matrices \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), the determinant of their product \\(\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{A}\\) is given by:\n    \\[\n    \\det(\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{A}) = \\det(\\mathbf{B}) \\cdot \\det(\\mathbf{A})\n    \\]\n\n2. **Substitute the Values:**\n    Plug in the known values:\n    \\[\n    \\det(\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{A}) = 3 \\times -7\n    \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Determinant:**\n    Perform the multiplication:\n    \\[\n    \\det(\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{A}) = -21\n    \\]\n\nOh! That calculation was straightforward. I remember sometimes overthinking these problems, but the determinant properties are powerful and simplify the work significantly.\n\n**Validation:**\n\nLet's check if anything seems off. The mechanics seem right: We used the determinant property correctly. Each number involved matches what was given, and our math seems correct. Determinant properties are typically independent of matrix size as long as the same size is being multiplied, so we're good here.\n\nConclusively, the determinant of the matrix product \\(\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{A}\\) is \\(-21\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI found the application pretty smooth here. Knowing the determinant properties really simplifies what could otherwise look like a complicated problem. No need for other strategies, as this direct application got us right to the solution! Generally, reflection helps avoid errors, but this straightforward route feels confidently correct.",
