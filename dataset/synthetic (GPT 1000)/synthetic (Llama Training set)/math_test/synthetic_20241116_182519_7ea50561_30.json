  "problem": "Tom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles, 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips, a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair, how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato Head can be bald.\n\nNote: You cannot \"mix and match\".  For example, you cannot take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this. At first glance, this problem seems to be about calculating the total combinations of different features Mr. Potato Head can wear. I remember doing similar problems involving combinations, and it feels like that\u2019s the track we\u2019re on. But let\u2019s break it down piece by piece to get a clear picture.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n- This is a combinations problem, which I think can be solved by multiplying the number of choices for each feature.\n- I realize we have multiple parts: hairstyles, eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, and shoes. Plus, there\u2019s the twist that hair is optional.\n- A clear image in my head is Mr. Potato Head with his various parts being picked from a wardrobe, so to speak.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n\n1. **Identify the Features and Their Options:**\n   - **Hair:** 3 options (and crucially, hair is optional, meaning he could be bald, which technically makes it 4 options)\n   - **Eyebrows:** 2 sets\n   - **Eyes:** 1 set of googly eyes\n   - **Ears:** 2 sets\n   - **Lips:** 2 sets\n   - **Shoes:** 2 pairs (regular and clown shoes)\n\n    So I need to determine the number of combinations for each feature and then multiply them together.\n\n2. **Reconsider the Optional Hair:**\n   - Initially, I counted hair as 3 options, but realizing it can be absent adds 1 more total option. Okay, so that's really 4 choices (3 styles + 1 no hair). That makes sense.\n\n3. **Each Feature Component Calculation (one by one):**\n   - Hair: 4 choices (since bald is an option)\n   - Eyebrows: 2 choices\n   - Eyes: 1 choice\n   - Ears: 2 choices\n   - Lips: 2 choices\n   - Shoes: 2 choices\n\n4. **Check Each Part Visually:**\n   - Thinking through it: If I imagine picking each feature from a shelf, I have my choice among all the options for one feature, and then I pick the next. The combinations add up... mathematics supports this view.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Combinations:**\n   - The total number of wacky personalities can be determined by multiplying all these choices together:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Combinations} = 4 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \n     \\]\n\n6. **Perform Multiplication:**\n   - Solving step-by-step:\n     - \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\)\n     - \\(8 \\times 1 = 8\\) (the single choice for eyes doesn't change the total)\n     - \\(8 \\times 2 = 16\\)\n     - \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\)\n     - \\(32 \\times 2 = 64\\)\n\n7. **Final Thoughts:**\n   - The calculation checks out. I walked through each feature and confirmed the choices. The total number of different wacky personalities Tom can create with Mr. Potato Head is 64.\n   - Ending on a reflection: The fact that hair being optional added to the complexity was interesting, but I've definitely grasped the concept here.\n\nHence, the final answer is that Tom can create 64 different wacky Mr. Potato Head personalities.",

  "ground_truth": "There are 2 choices of eyebrows, 1 choice for eyes, 2 choices for ears, 2 choices for lips, 2 choices for shoes, and 4 choices for hair (3 choices of hairstyles, or bald), and each can be picked independent of the others, so the number of combinations is the product of those, $2\\cdot 1\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{64}$."
