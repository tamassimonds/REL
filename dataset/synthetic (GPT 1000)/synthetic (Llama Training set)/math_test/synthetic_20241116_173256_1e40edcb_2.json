    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see where our thought process takes us. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\nThe task is to find the hundreds digit of the product of the numbers from 5 to 10. Initially, these kinds of problems remind me a bit of some prime factorization problems or modular arithmetic, but let's see if we can find a more straightforward way.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n1. **Calculate Directly**: Just compute the product step-by-step and see what we get.\n2. **Break into Smaller Products**: Sometimes multiplying smaller groups can make calculations more manageable.\n3. **Estimate and Check**: Get a rough idea of the product, check the magnitude, and home in on the hundreds digit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n#### 1. **Calculating Directly**\n\nLet's see what happens if we multiply these numbers directly. It's a finite product, so maybe it's simpler than I think.\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 6 \\times 7 \\times 8 \\times 9 \\times 10\n\\]\n\nI'm looking at this and realizing that multiplying everything all at once might be error-prone, especially since human error in arithmetic can sneak in. Instead, I'll break it down into smaller steps:\n\n- **First Pair:** \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\)\n- **Second Pair:** \\(30 \\times 7 = 210\\)\n- **Third Pair:** \\(210 \\times 8 = 1680\\)\n  \n  (Quick pause: 1680 seems a bit big, so I'll recheck)\n  \n  \\((210 \\times 8 = 210 \\times (10 - 2) = 2100 - 420 = 1680)\\). Okay, that seems alright.\n\n- **Fourth Pair:** \\(1680 \\times 9 = 15120\\)\n  - Just to verify: \\(1680 \\times 9 = 1680 \\times (10 - 1) = 16800 - 1680 = 15120\\)\n\n- **Final Step:** \\(15120 \\times 10 = 151200\\)\n\n#### 2. **Extracting the Hundreds Digit**\nFrom the final product, 151200, it's clear the hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. Thus, the hundreds digit is 2.\n\n### Reflecting on the Process\nSometimes simpler, more naive approaches work best for a problem like this. Breaking the problem into smaller parts worked here. \n\n### Conclusion\nThe hundreds digit of the product \\(5 \\times 6 \\times 7 \\times 8 \\times 9 \\times 10\\) is 2. This approach of sequential multiplication helped reduce the potential for error, and rechecking by estimating parts along the way was a helpful strategy to build confidence in the result.",

  "ground_truth": "The hundreds digit in the given expression is the same as the tens digit in the expression $5\\times6\\times7\\times8\\times9$, which is the same as the ones digit in the expression $6\\times7\\times4\\times9$ (we divide out a 10 each time). $6\\times7=42$ has a ones digit of 2 and $4\\times9=36$ has a ones digit of 6, and $2\\times6=12$, so the entire product has a ones digit of $\\boxed{2}$."
