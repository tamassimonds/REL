    "working_out": "**First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, I have a problem about fake gold bricks. It's comparing the cost of different sized cubes based on their surface area and volume. I know surface area and volume increase differently as the size changes, and that's key here. It looks like a mixture of linear and cubic relationships. If I understand this, the costs relate to two different quantities, surface area (for paint) and volume (for concrete).\n\nInitially, I feel that we can use the given costs of 1-inch and 2-inch cubes to establish some sort of relationship, maybe system of equations. Then, extend that relationship to determine the cost for a 3-inch cube.\n\n**Step 1: Define the relationships:**\n\n- Volume of a cube with side \\(s\\) is \\(s^3\\).\n- Surface area of a cube with side \\(s\\) is \\(6s^2\\).\n\nI think I need equations for each cost element - one for volume and one for surface area. Let the cost proportional to the volume be \\(V\\), and the cost proportional to the surface area be \\(S\\). Thus:\n\n\\[ V = k_1 \\times s^3 \\]\n\\[ S = k_2 \\times 6s^2 \\]\n\nSo the total cost for a cube of side \\(s\\) can be written as:\n\n\\[ C_s = V + S = k_1s^3 + 6k_2s^2 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Set up equations with given data:**\n\n- For a 1-inch cube: \n  \\[ C_1 = k_1(1)^3 + 6k_2(1)^2 = 1.30 \\]\n  \\[ k_1 + 6k_2 = 1.30 \\]\n\n- For a 2-inch cube:\n  \\[ C_2 = k_1(2)^3 + 6k_2(2)^2 = 6.80 \\]\n  \\[ 8k_1 + 24k_2 = 6.80 \\]\n\nOkay, pause here. We've got two equations:\n\n1. \\( k_1 + 6k_2 = 1.30 \\)\n2. \\( 8k_1 + 24k_2 = 6.80 \\)\n\n**Step 3: Solve the system of equations:**\n\nLet's solve these equations through substitution or elimination. I think elimination might work simpler here. Multiply the first equation by 8:\n\n\\[ 8k_1 + 48k_2 = 10.40 \\]\n\nNow we subtract the second equation from this result:\n\n\\[ (8k_1 + 48k_2) - (8k_1 + 24k_2) = 10.40 - 6.80 \\]\n\\[ 24k_2 = 3.60 \\]\n\\[ k_2 = 0.15 \\]\n\nWith \\(k_2\\) known, substitute back into the first equation:\n\n\\[ k_1 + 6(0.15) = 1.30 \\]\n\\[ k_1 + 0.90 = 1.30 \\]\n\\[ k_1 = 0.40 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the cost for a 3-inch cube:**\n\nNow that we know \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\), we can calculate the cost for a 3-inch cube:\n\n\\[\nC_3 = k_1(3)^3 + 6k_2(3)^2\n= 0.40(27) + 6(0.15)(9)\n= 10.80 + 8.10\n= 18.90\n\\]\n\nHmm, let me just do a quick check: Did I calculate everything correctly on the math side? Yep, makes sense. The solution flows correctly from understanding the relationships, deriving equations, solving, and applying the derived values.\n\n**Reflections:**\n\nYup, I mapped out the relationships between geometry and costs correctly and solved the equations with no logical mistakes along the way. Final result checks out. Happy with that!\n\nThe cost of making a 3-inch cube would be \\$18.90.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the cost per square inch of gold paint, and let $y$ be the cost per cubic inch of concrete.  Since a 1 inch cube has surface area 6 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 1 $\\text{in}^3$ its total price will be $6x+y$ dollars.  Similarly, a 2 inch cube has surface area 24 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 8 $\\text{in}^3$, so its total price will be $24x+8y$ dollars.  We are given that \\begin{align*} 6x+y &=\\$1.30 \\\\ 24x+8y&= \\$6.80 \\end{align*} Subtracting 4 times the first equation from the second gives $4y=\\$1.60$, so $y=\\$0.40$.  Hence $6x=\\$0.90$, so $x=\\$0.15$.  Since a 3 inch cube has surface area 54 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 27 $\\text{in}^3$, its total price will be a total of $54(\\$0.15)+27(\\$0.40)=\\boxed{\\$18.90}$."
