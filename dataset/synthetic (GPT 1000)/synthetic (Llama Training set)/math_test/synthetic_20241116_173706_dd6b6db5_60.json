    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle the problem of computing \\(\\cos 315^\\circ\\). Here's how I would think through this step by step:\n\n## Initial Thoughts:\n\n- **Familiarity with Trigonometric Functions:** Initially, this reminds me of the unit circle and how cosine relates to the x-coordinate of a point on that circle. The angle \\(315^\\circ\\) stands out because it\u2019s more than \\(270^\\circ\\), which is three-quarters of a full circle (which is \\(360^\\circ\\)).\n  \n- **Different Approaches:** I could look for a reference angle to break it down into a simpler calculation. Alternatively, I might recall some properties of trigonometric functions in different quadrants or look back at trigonometric identities.\n\n## Brainstorming the Approach:\n\n1. **Unit Circle Method:** This angle, \\(315^\\circ\\), is in the fourth quadrant. I'm recalling that in the fourth quadrant, cosine values are positive. The cosine of an angle equals the x-coordinate of its point on the unit circle.\n\n2. **Reference Angle Method:** Often, a helpful trick is to compute a reference angle, especially when working with angles not on standard location like \\(0^\\circ, 90^\\circ\\). Since \\(315^\\circ\\) is more than \\(270^\\circ\\), I can find the reference angle by subtracting the angle from \\(360^\\circ\\): \n   \\[\n   360^\\circ - 315^\\circ = 45^\\circ.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Using Trigonometric Identities:** I remember that \\(\\cos(360^\\circ - \\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)\\). \n\n## Step-by-Step Calculations:\n\n- **Calculating Reference Angle:** \n  \\[\n  \\theta = 360^\\circ - 315^\\circ = 45^\\circ.\n  \\]\n  \n- **Using Quadrant and Identity:** Now, since \\(315^\\circ\\) lies in the fourth quadrant where cosine is positive, we use the identity:\n  \\[\n  \\cos(315^\\circ) = \\cos(45^\\circ).\n  \\]\n\n- **Finding \\(\\cos(45^\\circ)\\):** I recall the special angles where cosine of \\(45^\\circ\\) (or \\(\\pi/4\\) radians) is known to be:\n  \\[\n  \\cos(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\n  \\]\n\n- **Checking My Answer:** This seems reasonable. I remembered that in the fourth quadrant, cosine remains positive. The reference angle matches one of the special angles, and I checked the range to confirm the quadrant.\n\n## Final Answer:\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(\\cos 315^\\circ\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\n## Reflection:\n\n- Everything checks out nicely; the unit circle method coincides with the special angle knowledge making the process more intuitive.\n- Having these reference angles memorized does help in confirming the result quickly. If I hadn't arrived at an answer using this method, I might have checked using a calculator or reexamined the quadrant rules.\n- Always good to remember which trigonometric functions are positive in which quadrants \u2014 that can save a lot of second-guessing.\n\nI\u2019ve walked through thought processes such as reference angle computation and aligning it with quadrant logic, reinforcing both conceptual understanding and methodical problem-solving.",
