    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and take it step by step, being sure to capture all my thoughts along the way.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to find integers \\( x \\) that satisfy both \\( |x| + 5 < 7 \\) and \\( |x-3| > 2 \\).\n   - This involves dealing with absolute values, which often means considering different cases based on the values of \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Break Down Each Absolute Value Condition:**\n\n   - **Condition 1: \\( |x| + 5 < 7 \\)**\n     - Simplifying this gives \\( |x| < 2 \\).\n\n   - **Condition 2: \\( |x-3| > 2 \\)**\n     - This condition can be split into two separate inequalities:\n       - \\( x - 3 > 2 \\) and\n       - \\( -(x - 3) > 2 \\), i.e., \\( x < 1 \\).\n\n### Exploring Each Condition\n\n1. **Solve \\( |x| < 2 \\):**\n   - This inequality translates to \\( -2 < x < 2 \\).\n   - So the integers possibly satisfying this are \\( x = -1, 0, 1 \\).\n\n2. **Solve \\( |x-3| > 2 \\):**\n   - From the breakdown, we have:\n     - \\( x - 3 > 2 \\Rightarrow x > 5 \\)\n     - \\( x < 1 \\)\n\n   - These two inequalities mean \\( x > 5 \\) or \\( x < 1 \\).\n\n### Combining Conditions\n\nLooking at the possible integer solutions for each condition:\n\n- **From \\( |x| < 2 \\):** \\( x = -1, 0, 1 \\)\n- **From \\( |x-3| > 2 \\):** \\( x < 1 \\), which includes \\( x = -1, 0 \\) from the partial solutions of the first condition.\n\nNow, combine the results:\n\n- \\( x = -1, 0 \\) are the integers from the first interval that also satisfy the second inequality \\( x < 1 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe integers that satisfy both conditions are \\( x = -1, 0 \\).\n\n### Verification\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- For \\( x = -1 \\):\n  - \\( |x| = 1 \\), so \\( |x| + 5 = 6\\); \\( 6 < 7 \\) (satisfies first condition)\n  - \\( |x - 3| = |-4| = 4 \\), and \\( 4 > 2 \\) (satisfies second condition)\n\n- For \\( x = 0 \\):\n  - \\( |x| = 0 \\), so \\( |x| + 5 = 5\\); \\( 5 < 7 \\) (satisfies first condition)\n  - \\( |x - 3| = |0 - 3| = 3 \\), and \\( 3 > 2 \\) (satisfies second condition)\n\nBoth values satisfy the original inequalities. \n\nThus, the integers \\( x \\) that satisfy both conditions are \\( \\boxed{2} \\) integers, namely \\( x = -1, 0 \\). \n\n### Reflection\n\nThroughout the problem, I broke down the absolute value inequalities into manageable parts, making sure to handle each separately and then combine the results. Double-checking each step against the given conditions provided reassurance that the solutions were correct.",

  "ground_truth": "The inequality $|x| + 5 < 7$ reduces to $|x| < 2,$ and the only integers that satisfy this inequality are $-1,$ 0, and 1.  Of these, the only integers that satisfy $|x - 3| > 2$ are 0 and $-1,$ so there are $\\boxed{2}$ such integers."
