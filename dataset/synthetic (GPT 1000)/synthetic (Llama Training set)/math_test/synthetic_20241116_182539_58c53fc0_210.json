    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with the approach described!\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nOkay, so we have \\(\\frac{5! \\cdot 2!}{3!}\\). It seems like a problem of simplifying factorials. Factorials grow quickly, so the key might be to cancel out terms.\n\nFirst, let's understand the parts of the problem. We have three factorials, 5!, 2!, and 3!. My first instinct is to expand these and see if terms cancel out, but I wonder if there's a more strategic approach. Right, let's start by expanding the factorials.\n\n### Expanding Factorials\n- **5!** means \\(5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\).\n- **2!** means \\(2 \\times 1\\).\n- **3!** means \\(3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\).\n\nGiven these, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1) \\cdot (2 \\times 1)}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\n### Simplifying the Expression\nNow, I notice that several terms should cancel out. Let's cancel terms in the numerator and the denominator.\n\n#### Canceling Terms\n- The \\(3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\) from 5! and 3! can cancel directly. This leaves \\(5 \\times 4\\) in the numerator.\n\nOh! This cancels nicely:\n\\[\n\\frac{(5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)}{(3 \\times 2 \\times 1)} = (5 \\times 4)\n\\]\n\nNow, let's reintroduce the \\(2!\\):\n\\[\n5 \\times 4 \\times (2 \\times 1) = 5 \\times 4 \\times 2\n\\]\n\nSo, actually after simplifying directly:\n\\[\n5 \\times 4 = 20\n\\]\n\nThe \\(\\cdot \\, 2\\) from \\(2!\\) is actually unnecessary for further multiplication since it's effectively already accounted in pairing with the cancellation.\n\n### Final Calculation\nRewriting gives:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 4 = 20\n\\]\n\n### Checking the Work\nLet me double-check the arithmetic just to be certain:\n\n- Calculate the numerator: \\(5! = 120\\)\n- Multiply by \\(2! = 2\\), so the modified numerator is \\(120 \\times 2 = 240\\).\n- Calculate the denominator: \\(3! = 6\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{240}{6} = 40\\).\n\nOh wait, whoops, caught a mistake! I jumped a step. The multiplication and cancellation works, but at the larger assembled level instead of changing immediate factor-level cancel lines; let's directly look again at term convention:\n\n- Cancel \\(3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\) with \\(5 \\times 4\\), so:\n- \\(5! / 3! = 5 \\times 4\\)\n\nReaching all cancellation properly, total answer focused further:\n\n\\(\\frac{240}{6} = 40\\). Double step miss-check caught this again, meaning final re-aligned answer should be: 40.\n\nThere, all elements check out. Thanks for sticking with the process -- it was a valuable step-by-step to better assist sourcing a truthful issue and learns into simplification further.",
