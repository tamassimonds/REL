    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem step by step. Right off the bat, looking at the expression \\(\\sqrt{\\sqrt{4096} + \\sqrt[3]{4096} + \\sqrt[4]{4096}}\\), I realize we're dealing with nested roots and differentials\u2014that's a bit complex, but certainly manageable. My first thought is that I need to simplify each part inside the square root separately before tackling the whole thing.\n\nSo, let's first break it down:\n\n1. **Understand Each Component**:\n   - Start with \\(\\sqrt{4096}\\).\n   - Then, \\(\\sqrt[3]{4096}\\).\n   - Finally, \\(\\sqrt[4]{4096}\\).\n\n2. **Simplify Each Root**:\n\n   **Step 1**: Simplify \\(\\sqrt{4096}\\).\n   \n   - I know that 4096 is a perfect square, so I'll try breaking it down. It seems familiar, like maybe 2 raised to some power...\n   - Quick check: \\(4096 = 2^{12}\\) because I recall \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) and doubling twice more gives \\(4096\\).\n   - That means \\(\\sqrt{4096} = \\sqrt{2^{12}} = 2^{6} = 64\\).\n\n   -> Alright, so \\(\\sqrt{4096} = 64\\). This part worked.\n\n   **Step 2**: Simplify \\(\\sqrt[3]{4096}\\).\n   \n   - Here, I'm thinking, \"How does \\(2^{12}\\) fit into this cube root scenario?\"\n   - Well, if \\(4096 = 2^{12}\\), then \\(\\sqrt[3]{4096} = (2^{12})^{1/3} = 2^{12/3} = 2^{4} = 16\\).\n\n   -> Nice, \\(\\sqrt[3]{4096} = 16\\). That fits.\n\n   **Step 3**: Simplify \\(\\sqrt[4]{4096}\\).\n   \n   - Again, use \\(4096 = 2^{12}\\).\n   - So, \\(\\sqrt[4]{4096} = (2^{12})^{1/4} = 2^{12/4} = 2^{3} = 8\\).\n\n   -> Great, \\(\\sqrt[4]{4096} = 8\\).\n\n3. **Add the Simplified Components Together**:\n\n   Now we have:\n   - \\(\\sqrt{4096} = 64\\),\n   - \\(\\sqrt[3]{4096} = 16\\),\n   - \\(\\sqrt[4]{4096} = 8\\).\n\n   Calculate the sum:\n   \\[\n   64 + 16 + 8 = 88\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Outer Square Root**:\n\n   - Finally, calculate \\(\\sqrt{88}\\).\n   - Hmm, \\(\\sqrt{88}\\) doesn\u2019t seem like a perfect square... Let's estimate.\n   - I know that \\(9^2 = 81\\) and \\(10^2 = 100\\), so \\(\\sqrt{88}\\) is somewhere between 9 and 10.\n   - For more precision, I could simplify \\(\\sqrt{88}\\) as \\(2\\sqrt{22}\\). However, this problem doesn\u2019t require simplification beyond estimation.\n\nDone. Reflecting on this, I feel confident in my steps. Initially a bit intimidated, but breaking each norm into \\((2^{12/n})\\) powers made it manageable. Thus, the final simplification of the given expression is:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{\\sqrt{4096} + \\sqrt[3]{4096} + \\sqrt[4]{4096}} = \\sqrt{88} \\]\n\nThis looks good, though I've noted that further precision could be achieved through numeric estimation if needed.",
