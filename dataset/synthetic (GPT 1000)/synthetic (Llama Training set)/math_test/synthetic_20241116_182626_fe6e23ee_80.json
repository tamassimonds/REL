    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, it looks like this is a problem involving rates, specifically how different quantities (horses and hay) relate over time. I remember similar problems involving dimensions like distance, speed, and time. My instinct is to figure out the rate at which the horses consume hay and then adjust for different quantities of hay and horses.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst, let's break down what's given:\n- 6 horses eat 12 bales of hay in 12 hours.\n\nWhat we're asked to find:\n- How many hours will 36 bales of hay last for 12 horses?\n\n### Step 2: Explore Strategies\nInitially, my mind wants to find the rate at which one horse eats hay, then adjust for the new conditions. Let's try this method:\n1. **Find the Rate Per Horse:**\n   - If 6 horses eat 12 bales in 12 hours, what does one horse eat in one hour?\n   - Total bales consumed by one horse in one hour: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{12 \\text{ bales}}{6 \\text{ horses} \\times 12 \\text{ hours}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ bales per horse per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Reflecting on the above calculation:**\n   - Did that make sense? Yes, because 1/6 bales per horse per hour means each horse needs 6 hours to eat one bale, which seems consistent with the given data.\n\n### Step 3: Find Total Hours for Different Conditions\nNext, I\u2019ll calculate how long the 36 bales will last for the 12 horses:\n1. **Increase the Number of Horses:**\n   - If each horse eats \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) bales per hour, then 12 horses eat:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 2 \\text{ bales per hour}\n   \\]\n2. **Calculate Time for 36 bales:**\n   - If the 12 horses eat 2 bales per hour, how many hours for 36 bales?\n   - Total time for 36 bales:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36 \\text{ bales}}{2 \\text{ bales per hour}} = 18 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Check my work\nBefore declaring this the final answer, let me quickly reflect if this method makes sense:\n- Initial information: 6 horses = 12 bales = 12 hours. This simplifies to each horse eating 1/6 of a bale per hour, right?\n- Verification: 12 horses eating 2 bales per hour consuming 36 bales over 18 hours checks out logically.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe solution checks out with both logic and calculation. Therefore, it will take 12 horses a total of 18 hours to consume 36 bales of hay. \n\nI feel confident in this answer now. My calculations and logic seem consistent throughout. If any steps were off, I haven't spotted them on review. It's always helpful to take a second look to ensure consistency!",

  "ground_truth": "From the original rate, we note that 12 horses will eat 12 bales of hay in 6 hours. (Double the number of horses, half the time)  Therefore, 12 horses will eat 36 bales of hay in $\\boxed{18\\text{ hours}}$. (Triple the amount of hay, triple the time)"
