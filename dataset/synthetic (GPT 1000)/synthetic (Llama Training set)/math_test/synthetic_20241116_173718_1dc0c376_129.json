    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this!\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- Looking at the expression \\(24x^2 - 19x - 35\\), it reminds me of factoring quadratics.\n- The task is to express it in the form \\((Ax - 5)(2Bx + C)\\).\n- I notice that we're dealing with a trinomial quadratic polynomial, so this involves some factorization but with a specific pattern.\n\nStarting to brainstorm potential strategies:\n1. **Trial and Error for Factoring:** Normally for factoring, I'd find two binomials whose product equals the trinomial.\n2. **Pattern Matching:** We specifically need this in the form \\((Ax - 5)(2Bx + C)\\). The \\(-5\\) in \\(Ax - 5\\) hints that I'll plug this structure into \\(A\\) and \\(2B\\).\n3. **Coefficient Matching:** Expanding \\((Ax - 5)(2Bx + C)\\) and setting it equal to \\(24x^2 - 19x - 35\\) might pinpoint the values of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\).\n\n**Step 1: Pattern Matching Strategy**\n\n- I'll expand \\((Ax - 5)(2Bx + C)\\).\n\n\\[\n(Ax - 5)(2Bx + C) = 2ABx^2 + ACx - 10Bx - 5C\n\\]\n\n- Comparing this to \\(24x^2 - 19x - 35\\), we have:\n  1. The coefficient of \\(x^2\\) matching with \\(24\\): \\(2AB = 24\\)\n  2. The coefficient of \\(x\\) matching with \\(-19\\): \\(AC - 10B = -19\\)\n  3. The constant matching with \\(-35\\): \\(-5C = -35\\)\n\nHmm, this is quite promising! Let's delve into each of these equations.\n\n**Step 2: Solving the Equations**\n\n- From \\(-5C = -35\\), I derive: \n  \\[\n  C = 7\n  \\]\n\n- From \\(2AB = 24\\), I simplify:\n  \\[\n  AB = 12\n  \\]\n\n- Now handling \\(AC - 10B = -19\\) knowing \\(C = 7\\):\n  \\[\n  7A - 10B = -19\n  \\]\n\nThis is getting clearer. Let's tidy up and solve these equations.\n\n**Step 3: Trial and Error to Solve \\(AB = 12\\) and \\(7A - 10B = -19\\)**\n\n- Since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) must be integers, look for factor pairs of 12:\n  - \\(A=6, B=2\\)\n    \\[\n    7(6) - 10(2) = 42 - 20 = 22 \\quad (\\text{Doesn't work})\n    \\]\n  - \\(A=4, B=3\\)\n    \\[\n    7(4) - 10(3) = 28 - 30 = -2 \\quad (\\text{Doesn't work})\n    \\]\n  - \\(A=3, B=4\\)\n    \\[\n    7(3) - 10(4) = 21 - 40 = -19 \\quad (\\text{Works!})\n    \\]\n\nGreat, \\(A = 3\\), \\(B = 4\\), and \\(C = 7\\).\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nNow, I need to find \\(AB - 3C\\):\n\\[\nAB = 12, \\quad 3C = 3 \\times 7 = 21\n\\]\n\n\\[\nAB - 3C = 12 - 21 = -9 \n\\]\n\nThis feels right! Summing up the calculations, everything checks out.\n\n**Conclusion:** The value of \\(AB - 3C\\) is \\(-9\\).",
