    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'm looking at a puzzle involving some arithmetic in a strange setup, and my task is to ultimately find the product \\( A \\cdot B \\) where both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are positive integers. This looks like more of an algebraic relationship problem than a simple calculation.\n\nAt first glance, the layout is similar to a long addition problem involving numbers in base 9, given the subscripts like \\( A_9 \\) and \\( B_9 \\). But what exactly does this mean? I need to interpret this correctly to proceed.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe problem involves an addition formatted in a way that indicates something to do with carries and bases. \n\n- We have a three-column addition:\n  ```\n     AB_9\n   +  A_9\n  --------\n     B0_9\n  ```\n- It suggests that this is not typical addition, given the subscripts. It appears to be hinting at a base-related transformation for the given situation.\n\nWhat can we infer?\n\n- The presence of a subscript \\( 9 \\) suggests we might be working in base 9.\n- \\( AB_9 + A_9 = B0_9 \\) could imply something about transformations between numeration systems or an arithmetic pattern conditional on base 9.\n\nHmm... This looks sort of like I'm dealing with numbers in base 9 that need to make sense arithmetically. \n\nThink of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) as digits or single-digit numbers (because of base 9) and how these numbers work when they're added. It's crucial to check if I have a consistent base 9 representation here.\n\n**Step 2: Breaking Down the Addition Equation**\n\nLet's try setting these relationships explicitly to process them better:\n\n1. \\( AB_9 \\) \u2014 This could mean \\( 9A + B \\) if treated as a two-digit base 9 number. The interpretation comes from a base 10 digit formula where we structure as:\n    - First digit \\( A \\) is \\( (digit) \\times 9 \\)\n    - Second digit \\( B \\)\n  \n2. \\( A_9 \\) \u2014 This is simply \\( A \\).\n\n3. \\( B0_9 \\) \u2014 Having \\( B0 \\) in base 9 should mean \\( 9B + 0 = 9B \\).\n\nWhen we write the equation, the part \\( AB_9 + A_9 \\) might mean:\n\\[ (9A + B) + A = 9B \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve the Equation**\n\nLet's solve:\n1. Combine terms: \n\n   \\[ 10A + B = 9B \\]\n\n2. Move terms around to focus on one variable:\n\n   \\[ 10A = 8B \\]\n\n   \\[ 5A = 4B \\]\n\nHence,\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{4B}{5} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Reflect on Solution for Integer Values**\n\nGiven that A and B must be integers, we should make \\( \\frac{4B}{5} \\) resolve to an integer. Since 5 divides B must be a multiple of 5, make \\( B = 5 \\).\n\nLet's substitute \\( B = 5 \\) in:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{5} = 4 \\]\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Product**\n\nChecking solution consistency first:\n- Set \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 5 \\). Hence:\n\\[ 10A + B = 10(4) + 5 = 45 \\]\n\nDo the conversion:\n- \\( 9A + B = 9(4) + 5 = 36 + 5 = 41 \\)\n- \\( A_9 = 4_9 = 4 \\)\n- Add: \\( 41 + 4 = 45 \\), which equals \\( B0_9 = 9 \\times 5 = 45 \\)\n\nEverything checks out. Finally:\n\n\\[ A \\cdot B = 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\]\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{20}\\). This solution confirms that my interpretation and calculations have held up, with each condition being satisfactorily met and all checks consistently supporting the final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "The first possibility we have is that $A$ and $B$ are both equal to 0, in which case the addition problem would simplify to $0+0=0$. However, since the problem states that both $A$ and $B$ are positive integers, we can eliminate this possibility. Therefore we can assume that there is carrying in the right column, giving us $A_9+B_9=10_9$ or that $A+B=9$. Since we know that there is a 1 carried over, the left column tell us that $1+A=B$. Solving this system of equations, we find that $A=4$ and $B=5$. Thus, $A\\cdot B=4\\cdot5=\\boxed{20}$."
