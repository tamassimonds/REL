    "working_out": "### Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**:  \n   Okay, so we need to figure out Mary's average speed during a 15-mile race that she completed in 2.5 hours. This problem seems straightforward because it\u2019s asking for average speed, which is typically the total distance divided by total time. \n\n2. **Exploring Strategies**:  \n    - My first thought is to use the formula for average speed: \n    \\[\n    \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}}\n    \\]\n    This seems like a direct way to solve the problem since we are given the total distance (15 miles) and the total time (2.5 hours).\n    - Another possible strategy could involve unit conversion, just to double-check if calculations are done correctly. For instance, if we change the hours to minutes or seconds, would this help verify the correctness?\n    - A quick reflection: This really sounds like something I\u2019ve done before in basic speed math problems. It should work because speed problems typically follow this method unless other complications are introduced, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here.\n\n### Calculations\n\n- **Step 1: Applying the Formula**:  \n  Using the formula for average speed:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{15 \\text{ miles}}{2.5 \\text{ hours}}\n  \\]\n\n- **Step 2: Performing the Division**:  \n  This is dividing 15 by 2.5.\n  - Now, I'll do the division:\n    - First guess or intuition: 15 divided by 3 is 5, so if I reduce the divisor should be more than 5.\n    - Quick calculation: \\(15 \\div 2.5\\)  \n    Hmm, maybe converting to a simpler division might help.  \n    Converting 2.5 to a fraction: \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\) meaning I have to multiply the numerator by 2 to simplify:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{15 \\times 2}{5} = \\frac{30}{5} = 6\n    \\]\n\n### Reflection and Checking\n\n- **Initial Check**:\n  - Thinking about the result, 6 miles per hour as an average speed seems reasonable because if Mary covered 15 miles in 2.5 hours, she would cover a bit more than 5 miles in 1 hour (2.5 times 6 equals 15).\n\n- **Further Reflection**:\n  - Converting the time to minutes could help verify. \n  \\[\n  2.5 \\text{ hours} = 2 \\times 60 + 0.5 \\times 60 = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n  \\]\n  Now, using this with 15 miles, we calculate the speed in miles per minute first: \\( \\frac{15}{150} = 0.1 \\) miles per minute. Now convert back to per hour by multiplying by 60,\n  \\[\n  0.1 \\times 60 = 6 \\text{ miles per hour}\n  \\]\n  The numbers match, so the calculations verify the original result.\n\n- **Conclusion**:\n  - I've reached the answer that makes logical sense and has been verified through unit conversion reassessment. Mary\u2019s average speed is indeed 6 miles per hour.\n\n- **Final Thoughts**:\n  - It\u2019s always interesting how different ways to view the problem (like fractions in the calculation) can be illuminating.\n  - I\u2019m glad I checked using alternative approaches because they strengthened my confidence in the answer.\n  - Encountered no real dead ends but had moments where exploring other ways felt equally simple and reassured my calculations were correct.",
