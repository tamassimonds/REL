    "working_out": "**Step 1: Understand the Question**\n\nAlright, let's take a look at this problem. We're given a fraction, \\(\\frac{18!}{16!}\\), and we need to simplify it. Based on my recollection, factorial notation (!) indicates the product of all positive integers up to a certain number. For example, \\(5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\).\n\n**First Thoughts**\n\n- I know factorials grow large quickly, so simplifying this should help make the numbers more manageable.\n- This reminds me of problems I've solved before where you cancel out terms in fractions.\n\n**Step 2: Exploring Initial Strategies**\n\nNow, how can I simplify \\(\\frac{18!}{16!}\\)?\n\n- If I write out the factorials, I'll see how many terms I can cancel out.\n- \\(18! = 18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15 \\times \\ldots \\times 1\\)\n- \\(16! = 16 \\times 15 \\times \\ldots \\times 1\\)\n\n**Step 3: Simplify by Cancelling Terms**\n\nHere's a potential approach:\n\n- Notice that the entire \\(16!\\) in the denominator will cancel out with part of the \\(18!\\) in the numerator.\n- So, I can rewrite \\(\\frac{18!}{16!}\\) as:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{18 \\times 17 \\times (16 \\times 15 \\times \\ldots \\times 1)}{16 \\times 15 \\times \\ldots \\times 1}\n  \\]\n- Cancel out the \\(16!\\), and I'm left with:\n  \\[\n  18 \\times 17\n  \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Result**\n\nNow, calculate this simpler expression:\n\n- \\(18 \\times 17\\)\n  \nLet's do that math:\n\n- Breaking it down, \\(18 \\times 17\\) can be computed by distributive property: \n  \\[\n  18 \\times 17 = 18 \\times (10 + 7) = (18 \\times 10) + (18 \\times 7)\n  \\]\n- \\(18 \\times 10 = 180\\)\n- \\(18 \\times 7 = 126\\)\n- Adding them together, \\(180 + 126 = 306\\)\n\n**Step 5: Check the Answer**\n\nTime for a quick reflection:\n\n- The initial approach seems reasonable; I canceled correctly, leading to a straightforward multiplication.\n- Checking via another way: Since I didn't overlook any terms (like forgetting that \\(17\\) or \\(18\\) weren't included in \\(16!\\)), everything adds up.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully considering each step and ensuring no mistakes on the way, the simplified form of \\(\\frac{18!}{16!}\\) is \\(306\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We can express $\\frac{18!}{16!}$ as $\\frac{18\\cdot17\\cdot16!}{16!}$. To simplify this expression, we can cancel $16!$ from the numerator and denominator, leaving us with $18\\cdot17$, or $\\boxed{306}$."
