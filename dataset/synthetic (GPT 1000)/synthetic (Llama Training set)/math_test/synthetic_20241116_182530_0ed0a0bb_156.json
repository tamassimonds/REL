    "working_out": "Alright, let's take a close look at this problem of finding the remainder when \\( x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 30 \\) is divided by \\( x - 3 \\). \n\nFirst thoughts: \n- This feels like a classic polynomial division problem related to the Remainder Theorem. If memory serves, the Remainder Theorem states that if you divide a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) by a linear divisor \\( x - c \\), the remainder is \\( f(c) \\). \n- Let me think...Yes, that's right! This means I might not even need to perform long division explicitly \u2013 I can simply substitute \\( x = 3 \\) into the polynomial to find the remainder.\n\nLet's first try the Remainder Theorem approach:\n\n1. **Substitute \\( x = 3 \\) into the polynomial:**  \n   \\[\n   f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 30\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f(3) = 3^3 - 3 \\cdot 3^2 - 9 \\cdot 3 + 30\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate each term separately to avoid mistakes:**\n   - \\( 3^3 = 27 \\)\n   - \\( 3 \\cdot 3^2 = 3 \\cdot 9 = 27 \\)\n   - \\( 9 \\cdot 3 = 27 \\)\n\n3. **Put it all together:**\n   \\[\n   f(3) = 27 - 27 - 27 + 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the expression:**\n   \\[\n   f(3) = 27 - 27 - 27 + 30 = -27 + 30 = 3\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final result using the Remainder Theorem:**\n   - The remainder when \\( x^3 - 3x^2 - 9x + 30 \\) is divided by \\( x - 3 \\) is 3.\n\nLet's quickly reflect: \n\n- This approach seems too easy, perhaps because the theorem is specifically designed for this problem type. The calculations appear correct. Each step makes sense based on what I know about polynomial substitution, and any arithmetic done step-by-step checks out correctly.\n  \nWould double-checking be beneficial? Let\u2019s consider another verification method using synthetic division, but I predict it should yield the same remainder.\n\n### Synthetic Division:\n- **Set up for synthetic division with:**\n  - The divisor root \\( 3 \\).\n  - The coefficients of the polynomial: \\( 1, -3, -9, 30 \\).\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. **Write down the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{cccc}\n   3 & | & 1 & -3 & -9 & 30 \\\\\n     &   &   &    &    &    \\\\\n     &   &   &    &    &    \\\\\n     &   &   &    &    &    \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Bring down the first coefficient (1):**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{cccc}\n   3 & | & 1 & -3 & -9 & 30 \\\\\n     &   &   &    &    &    \\\\\n     &   & 1 &    &    &    \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply, add and repeat:**\n   - Multiply 1 by 3, add to -3: 0\n   - Multiply 0 by 3, add to -9: -9\n   - Multiply -9 by 3, add to 30: 3\n\n   Completing the synthetic division:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{cccc}\n   3 & | & 1 & -3 & -9 & 30 \\\\\n     &   &   &  3 &  0 & -9 \\\\\n     &   & 1 &  0 & -9 & \\boxed{3} \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\nThe remainder is indeed 3, confirming our Remainder Theorem result. This consistency reinforces that the approach makes sense, and I've correctly identified and applied the underlying principles of polynomial division. \n\nThus, final answer: The remainder is 3.",
