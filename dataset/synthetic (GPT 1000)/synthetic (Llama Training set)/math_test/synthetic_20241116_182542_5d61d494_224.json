    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n    - We're given the equation \\( |2 - |x|| = 1 \\).\n    - We need to find all real \\( x \\) that satisfy this equation and then compute the sum of the squares of these values.\n\n2. **Exploring the Structure**:\n    - The equation involves nested absolute values. Typically, I'll consider breaking this down into different cases since absolute values depend on conditions (like being positive or negative).\n\n3. **Choosing a Strategy**:\n    - My first thought is to consider the possible cases based on the inner absolute value since that will help simplify the structure.\n    - After resolving the absolute value cases, I need to think about what happens when the absolute value simplifies to both positive and negative numbers.\n\n### Breaking Down the Problem\n\n1. **Consider \\( |x| \\) separately**:\n    - Given, \\( |2 - |x|| = 1 \\), it can split into two cases:\n      a. \\( 2 - |x| = 1 \\)\n      b. \\( 2 - |x| = -1 \\)\n\n2. **Solve Each Case**:\n\n   **Case 1**: \\( 2 - |x| = 1 \\)\n   - Solving: \n     \\[\n     2 - |x| = 1 \\implies |x| = 1\n     \\]\n   - \\( |x| = 1 \\) means \\( x = 1 \\) or \\( x = -1 \\).\n\n   **Case 2**: \\( 2 - |x| = -1 \\)\n   - Solving:\n     \\[\n     2 - |x| = -1 \\implies |x| = 3\n     \\]\n   - \\( |x| = 3 \\) means \\( x = 3 \\) or \\( x = -3 \\).\n\n3. **Collect All Solutions**:\n   - From both cases, the solutions are \\( x = 1, -1, 3, -3 \\).\n\n### Calculating the Desired Sum\n\n4. **Sum of Squares**:\n   - We're asked to calculate the sum of the squares of these values: \n   \\[\n   1^2 + (-1)^2 + 3^2 + (-3)^2 \n   \\]\n   - Calculations:\n     \\[\n     1^2 = 1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (-1)^2 = 1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3^2 = 9\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (-3)^2 = 9\n     \\]\n   - Sum these results:\n     \\[\n     1 + 1 + 9 + 9 = 20\n     \\]\n\n### Reflecting on the Solution\n\n- Everything seems to add up! I considered all potential values for \\( x \\) using the absolute value property. Breaking down the absolute value condition properly helped uncover all possible solutions, and the sum of squares was straightforward.\n\n- During the process, I faced the correct forms for absolute values and properly reflected upon possible structure solutions.\n\n- The solution was checked and recalculated briefly, and the path followed seems logically consistent and correct.\n\nThus, the sum of the squares of all real values of \\( x \\) for which \\( |2 - |x|| = 1 \\) is **20**.",

  "ground_truth": "The absolute value of a number equals 1 if and only if the number equals either $-1$ or 1.  Setting $2-|x|$ equal to 1 and to $-1$, we solve \\begin{align*}\n2-|x|=1 \\quad &\\text{or} \\quad 2-|x|=-1 \\\\\n|x|=1 \\quad &\\text{or} \\quad |x|=3 \\\\\nx=\\pm1 \\quad &\\text{or} \\quad x=\\pm3.\n\\end{align*} The sum of the squares of these four solutions is $(-1)^2+1^2+(-3)^2+3^2=\\boxed{20}$."
