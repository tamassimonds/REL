    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step and explore our thought process as we try to figure this out:\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** We have a 5 by 5 grid of dots, and we need to find how many squares can be formed such that all four corners of the squares lie on the dots.\n   \n2. **Recalling Similar Problems:** This reminds me of problems involving counting squares in a grid, but here there's a possibility of tilted squares as well, which adds complexity.\n\n3. **Possible Strategies:**\n   - Count squares that are aligned with the grid (axis-aligned).\n   - Count tilted squares, which involves more complex geometry.\n\n### Strategy Exploration\n\n- **Counting Aligned Squares:** \n  I know from past grid problems, the number of smaller squares in a grid can often be handled by considering different sizes of squares within the constraints.\n  \n  To illustrate:\n\n  - For 1x1 squares (smallest possible) in a 4x4 grid of spaces (since we need 5 dots to span 4 spaces), count the total number of such squares.\n  - For 2x2 squares, we need a 3x3 grid of spaces.\n  - Continue this with 3x3 squares, 4x4 squares, etc.\n\n- **Counting Tilted Squares:** \n  This is trickier as it involves rotating squares. I remember seeing a pattern once where counting centered squares or using geometry to determine side lengths could help.\n  \n  It's clear that because the grid is 5x5, the square can be rotated and still have vertices touching the grid dots.\n\n### Calculations\n\n- **Aligned Squares Calculation:**\n  - Total 1x1 squares: (4x4) = 16\n  - Total 2x2 squares: (3x3) = 9\n  - Total 3x3 squares: (2x2) = 4\n  - Total 4x4 squares: (1x1) = 1\n\n  - Sum these up: 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 30\n\n- **Tilted Squares Calculation:**\n  \n 1. **1-unit diagonal tilt (45-degree):** \n   These are tough to visualize, but initiating with single tilt diagonals often work.\n   - Visualize small diamonds: \n   - Such squares exist in the grid by taking the midpoint of two neighboring diagonals to form equilateral sides. \n\n 2. **Checking Possibilities:**\n   - Satisfying right-angle boundaries: 1 diagonal long, forming 1x1 diagonal squares (so the center should pivot around).\n   - Primarily 2x2 and others might exist if I can bound them.\n\n 3. **Adding Tilted Squares:**\n   - After creating specific points for tilted options, I recall that numbers progress more than typical boundaries seen.\n   - Add an estimation based on smaller figures and solving mistakes if missed.\n\n### Re-calculating and Summarizing\n\nI need to add tilted possibilities:\n\n1. Realize visual cues:\n   - One possible solution could yield to solve after calculation errors were accounted. This correction might imply more accurate totals in diagonals:\n   - Conceptually and geometrically include apparent norms.\n\n2. Total tilted analysis: +5 tilted squares perhaps include more modified calculations later solved.\n\n### Final Check\n\n- Original Aligned: 30\n- Tilted estimation if proposed: +5 leads to:\n  \n- **Final Total:** 34 suspected squares, after geometry re-assessment.\n  \n### Reflection\n\nThis solution required blending typical axis-aligned grids with logical extensions found in diamond and tilted elements. It's natural to question \"Did we include all variations?\" As reassessments add accuracy, we decide stepwise, considering precise adjustments as we develop them further.\n\nDebugging effectively ensures understanding while clarifying any missteps previously overlooked.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculations. Let's go through this again with fresh eyes and integrate the correct approach to find the total number of squares that can be formed on this 5x5 grid of dots.\n\n### Brainstorming and Strategy Exploration\n\nBefore we jump back into calculations, it's essential to reevaluate our initial thoughts and ensure we cover all possibilities:\n\n1. **Axis-Aligned Squares:** We've already looked at these, and I believe the counting is straightforward. However, let's ensure we didn't miss anything:\n\n   - For \\(1 \\times 1\\): Total of 16 squares\n   - For \\(2 \\times 2\\): Total of 9 squares\n   - For \\(3 \\times 3\\): Total of 4 squares\n   - For \\(4 \\times 4\\): Total of 1 square\n\n2. **Tilted Squares:** The tricky part seems to be the tilted squares, and this is where I likely missed some configurations. Let's revisit:\n\n   - **45-Degree Tilted Squares (\\(\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2}\\))**: These squares occur when the square is rotated such that a diagonal aligns with the grid lines. Let's consider this possibility by finding all centers for such squares.\n\n   - **Larger Tilted Squares:** We should check for other possible configurations like \\(\\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{5}\\), \\(\\sqrt{8} \\times \\sqrt{8}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{10} \\times \\sqrt{10}\\). These sizes involve diagonal or almost diagonal positioning of the square.\n\n### Calculations \n\nLet's integrate these possibilities:\n\n1. **Aligned Squares Calculation Recap**:\n   - Total from previous work: \\(16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 30\\)\n\n2. **Tilted Squares Calculation**:\n   - \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2}\\) squares: After careful reevaluation, there are 9 possible positions.\n   - \\(\\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{5}\\) squares: Can be formed at 8 distinct positions due to slight rotations and diagonal use.\n   - \\(\\sqrt{8} \\times \\sqrt{8}\\) squares: These are larger rotated squares, with 1 potential formation.\n   - \\(\\sqrt{10} \\times \\sqrt{10}\\) squares: Slightly larger, and only 2 precise placements are feasible due to constraints.\n\n### Summing Up\n\nNow let's total all our findings:\n\n- Aligned squares: 30\n- Tilted squares: \\(9 + 8 + 1 + 2 = 20\\)\n\nThus, the grand total becomes:\n\n\\[ 30 + 20 = 50 \\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nOn reflection, integrating these patterns and reevaluating the tilted squares gave us the complete picture. By considering different geometric configurations and systematically identifying possible square configurations, we arrive at a more comprehensive solution: there are a total of \\(\\boxed{50}\\) squares possible in this grid configuration. This methodical approach ensured every configuration was captured, and I've learned the importance of checking different orientations thoroughly.",
