    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step!\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst, we need to evaluate the expression \\(\\frac{(xy)^5}{y^3}\\) for given values of \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = -3\\). \n\nThe first thing that pops into my mind is that this is an expression involving powers and division. I recall from algebra that when dividing like bases we can subtract exponents, which might be useful here.\n\n### Attempting the Calculation\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Substitute Values:**\n   - We have \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = -3\\).\n   - Substitute these into the expression: \\(\\frac{(2 \\cdot -3)^5}{(-3)^3}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate \\(xy\\):**\n   - Calculate the product \\(xy = 2 \\times -3 = -6\\).\n   - Substitute \\(-6\\) into the expression: \\(\\frac{(-6)^5}{(-3)^3}\\).\n\n3. **Evaluate the Powers:**\n   - Calculate \\((-6)^5\\). \n      - I remember that \\((-6)^5\\) involves multiplying \\(-6\\), five times: \\(-6 \\times -6 \\times -6 \\times -6 \\times -6\\).\n      - Hmm, let's do it step by step.\n         - \\((-6) \\times (-6) = 36\\)\n         - \\(36 \\times (-6) = -216\\)\n         - \\(-216 \\times (-6) = 1296\\)\n         - \\(1296 \\times (-6) = -7776\\)\n   - Calculate \\((-3)^3\\).\n      - This product will be \\((-3) \\times (-3) \\times (-3)\\).\n      - \\((-3) \\times (-3) = 9\\)\n      - \\(9 \\times (-3) = -27\\)\n\n   So, now the expression becomes \\(\\frac{-7776}{-27}\\).\n\n4. **Perform the Division:**\n   - Now, divide \\(-7776\\) by \\(-27\\). \n   - Since both the numerator and the denominator are negative, the result should be positive.\n   - Okay, let\u2019s perform the calculation:\n      - How do I reduce \\(\\frac{7776}{27}\\)? \n      - Divide 7776 by 27:\n      - Mental check, if this seems too big: Well, it might work with standard division.\n      - Perform the division on paper or calculator for ease: \n        \\(7776 \\div 27 = 288\\).\n\n### Reflections\n- At each calculation, I was cautious of interpreting the signs to ensure the negatives didn't throw things off.\n- The division check ensured I performed the power computations correctly.\n- The positive result makes sense given that dividing two negative numbers results in a positive.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the evaluated expression \\(\\frac{(xy)^5}{y^3}\\) where \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = -3\\) results in the value **288**.",
