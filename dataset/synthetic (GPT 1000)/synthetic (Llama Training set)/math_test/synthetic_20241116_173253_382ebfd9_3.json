    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. At first glance, we're tasked with dealing with a quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients, given that one of its roots is \\(3 + \\sqrt{7}\\). We're supposed to compute the ratio \\(\\frac{p(2)}{p(3)}\\). Let's brainstorm on what this question is asking and potential ways to approach it.\n\n### Initial Brainstorming\n\n- **Understanding the Root**: I've done problems where I've seen roots involving square roots, so something tells me the other root must be related to this. Polynomials with real coefficients often have complex conjugate roots. Similarly, with roots involving square roots like \\(3 + \\sqrt{7}\\), I suspect the other root might be \\(3 - \\sqrt{7}\\).\n- **Polynomial Characteristics**: If \\(3+\\sqrt{7}\\) is a root, and considering the coefficients are integers, its conjugate \\(3-\\sqrt{7}\\) should also be a root.\n- **Constructing the Polynomial**: If I assume (\\(3+\\sqrt{7}\\)) and (\\(3-\\sqrt{7}\\)) are the roots, I can construct the polynomial by multiplying \\((x - (3+\\sqrt{7}))(x - (3-\\sqrt{7}))\\).\n\n### Gathering Insight on the Polynomial\n\n- **Formulating the Quadratic**: Let's calculate it:\n  \\[\n  p(x) = (x - (3+\\sqrt{7}))(x - (3-\\sqrt{7}))\n  \\]\n  Notice this looks like a difference of squares:\n  \\[\n  p(x) = (x - 3)^2 - (\\sqrt{7})^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 - 7 = x^2 - 6x + 2\n  \\]\n- **Verification**: Now, let me pause a moment. Does this make sense? The derived polynomial \\(p(x) = x^2 - 6x + 2\\) is supposed to have \\(3+\\sqrt{7}\\) as a root. Let's verify:\n  \\[\n  (3 + \\sqrt{7})^2 - 6(3 + \\sqrt{7}) + 2 = (9 + 6\\sqrt{7} + 7) - (18 + 6\\sqrt{7}) + 2 = 0\n  \\]\n  Yes, \\(p(3 + \\sqrt{7}) = 0\\). This reassures that \\(p(x)\\) is correct.\n\n### Evaluating \\(p(2)\\) and \\(p(3)\\)\n\n- **Calculating \\(p(2)\\)**:\n  \\[\n  p(2) = 2^2 - 6 \\times 2 + 2 = 4 - 12 + 2 = -6\n  \\]\n- **Calculating \\(p(3)\\)**:\n  \\[\n  p(3) = 3^2 - 6 \\times 3 + 2 = 9 - 18 + 2 = -7\n  \\]\n\n### Final Computation\n\n- **Ratio of \\(p(2)\\) to \\(p(3)\\)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{p(2)}{p(3)} = \\frac{-6}{-7} = \\frac{6}{7}\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReflecting on this, each part follows logically from the previous steps and consistently led to the construction and testing of the polynomial. Evaluating \\(p(x)\\) at specific points was straightforward once the polynomial was verified. Thus, the requested ratio is \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\). \n\nEverything seems to check out, and the approach feels robust. If only for completeness, rigorously checking all steps strengthens confidence in the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Because $p(x)$ has integer coefficients (in particular, because it has rational coefficients), the other root of $p(x)$ must be the radical conjugate of $3+\\sqrt{7},$ which is $3-\\sqrt{7}.$ Then, $p(x)$ must take the form \\[p(x) = A(x-(3+\\sqrt{7}))(x-(3-\\sqrt{7}))\\]for some nonzero constant $A$. This means that\n\\[p(2) = A(-1+\\sqrt{7})(-1-\\sqrt{7}) = -6A\\]and \\[p(3) = A(\\sqrt{7})(-\\sqrt{7}) = -7A,\\]so \\[\\frac{p(2)}{p(3)} = \\frac{-6A}{-7A} = \\boxed{\\frac{6}{7}}.\\]Alternatively, the roots are $3 + \\sqrt{7}$ and $3 - \\sqrt{7},$ so the sum of the roots is 6 and the product of the roots is $(3 + \\sqrt{7})(3 - \\sqrt{7}) = 9 - 7 = 2,$ so\n\\[p(x) = A(x^2 - 6x + 2)\\]for some nonzero real number $A.$  Then\n\\[\\frac{p(2)}{p(3)} = \\frac{A(-6)}{A(-7)} = \\boxed{\\frac{6}{7}}.\\]"
