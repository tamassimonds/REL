    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem by breaking it down step by step. The problem asks us to find the largest number \\( k \\) less than 1000 that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. \n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- This reminds me of a problem involving the Chinese Remainder Theorem or solving congruences. We aren't strictly applying the theorem, but we're dealing with remainders. \n- My initial thought is to find a number that satisfies these congruences: \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\), \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\), \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\), \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6} \\), and \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\nStep 1: Common Structure\n- The requirement that \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n} \\) for each \\( n \\) means we're really looking for a number \\( k \\) that is 1 more than some common multiple of these numbers; i.e., \\( k = \\text{lcm}(3, 4, 5, 6, 7) + 1 \\).\n\nStep 2: Calculate the LCM\n- The strategy here is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n- Let's break this down:\n  - 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are our numbers.\n  - First, note that 6 is the product of 2 and 3. So for the primes: 2 needs to appear at least twice (for 4 = \\(2^2\\)), 3 appears once (3 and 6 share this), 5 appears once, and 7 appears once.\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{lcm}(3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7\n  \\]\n\n- Let's do the math:\n  - \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)\n  - \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\)\n  - \\( 12 \\times 5 = 60 \\)\n  - \\( 60 \\times 7 = 420 \\)\n\n- So, \\(\\text{lcm}(3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = 420\\).\n\nStep 3: Finding \\( k \\)\n- Now, \\( k = 420m + 1 \\), where \\( m \\) is an integer.\n- We need \\( k < 1000\\).\n\nStep 4: Solving for \\( m \\)\n- Solving \\( 420m + 1 < 1000 \\), we have:\n  \\[\n  420m < 999\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  m < \\frac{999}{420} \\approx 2.38\n  \\]\n- Since \\( m \\) must be an integer, the largest value \\( m \\) can take is 2.\n\nStep 5: Calculate \\( k \\) for \\( m = 2 \\)\n- If \\( m = 2 \\), then:\n  \\[\n  k = 420 \\times 2 + 1 = 841\n  \\]\n\nStep 6: Verification\n- Make sure that \\( 841 \\) leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7:\n  - \\( 841 \\div 3 \\Rightarrow 841 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\)\n  - \\( 841 \\div 4 \\Rightarrow 841 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\)\n  - \\( 841 \\div 5 \\Rightarrow 841 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\)\n  - \\( 841 \\div 6 \\Rightarrow 841 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6} \\)\n  - \\( 841 \\div 7 \\Rightarrow 841 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\n- Each division results in a remainder of 1, confirming that \\( k = 841 \\) meets all criteria.\n\nConclusion:\nThe largest number \\( k \\) less than 1000 that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is \\( 841 \\).",

  "ground_truth": "We can re-write the requirements of this problem as: \\begin{align*}k &\\equiv1\\pmod{3}\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{4},\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{5},\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{6},\\\\\nk &\\equiv1\\pmod{7}.\n\\end{align*}In other words, $k-1$ is divisible by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. We have  \\begin{align*}\n\\text{lcm}[3,4,5,6,7] &= \\text{lcm}[3,4,5,7] \\\\\n&= 3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 \\\\&= 420,\n\\end{align*}and thus $k-1$ must be divisible by $420$. The only two multiples of $420$ under $1000$ are $420$ and $840$, so the largest possible value of $k$ is $840+1 = \\boxed{841}$."
