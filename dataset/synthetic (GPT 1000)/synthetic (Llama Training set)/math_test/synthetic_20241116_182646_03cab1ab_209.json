    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We need to determine the smallest value of \\( c \\) such that the function \\( f(x) = -3x^2 + 36x - 7 \\) is invertible when its domain is restricted to \\( x \\in [c,\\infty) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nFirst, let's identify what it means for a function to be invertible. A function is invertible if it is one-to-one (bijective), meaning it passes the horizontal line test. For a quadratic function like ours, this typically means the function should be monotonic (either entirely non-decreasing or non-increasing) over the domain we're considering.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Quadratic Function\nThe given function \\( f(x) = -3x^2 + 36x - 7 \\) is a quadratic function opening downwards (since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is negative). The graph of this function is a parabola.\n\nThe vertex form and maximum point will help us understand the monotonicity.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Vertex\nA quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) has its vertex at \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\n- Here, \\( a = -3 \\), \\( b = 36 \\).\n- Vertex: \\( x = -\\frac{36}{2 \\times -3} = 6 \\).\n\nThe vertex form of the function will show that it reaches its maximum at \\( x = 6 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Monotonicity for Invertibility\nTo make the function invertible, it needs to be monotonic, either entirely increasing or decreasing, on the restricted domain. Since the parabola opens downwards, it decreases to the left and right from the vertex.\n\nSo, for \\( f(x) \\) to be invertible from some point \\( x = c \\) forwards, we need to start at the vertex and move right, ensuring the function is decreasing.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Smallest \\( c \\)\nWe intuitively think, \"Oh! Since the function is decreasing from the maximum point onward, the smallest value of \\( c \\) that allows the function to still be invertible is precisely the x-coordinate of the vertex.\"\n\nThus, to make sure the function is monotonic and invertible for \\( x \\in [c, \\infty) \\), the smallest \\( c \\) is exactly \\( x = 6 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Verification\nLet's quickly verify:\n- For \\( x = 6 \\), \\( f(x) = -3(6)^2 + 36(6) - 7 = -108 + 216 - 7 = 101 \\).\n- This means that for any \\( x \\geq 6 \\), the function is decreasing, satisfying the condition for invertibility.\n\nThere we have it, the smallest value of \\( c \\) for which \\( f(x) \\) is invertible when \\( x \\geq c \\) is \\( c = 6 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe smallest \\( c \\) for which the function \\( f \\) is invertible on the domain \\([c, \\infty)\\) is \\( c = 6 \\). This solution checks out, as the function becomes strictly decreasing from this point and hence is invertible over this interval.",

  "ground_truth": "We can complete the square, to get $f(x) = 101 - 3(x - 6)^2.$  Thus, the graph of $f(x)$ is a parabola with axis of symmetry $x = 6,$ so the smallest possible value of $c$ is $\\boxed{6}.$"
