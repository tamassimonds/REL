    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into the problem: \n\n**First Thoughts:** \nWe're looking for isosceles triangles with side lengths that add up to a total perimeter of 20 units. My first thought is, this sounds like we need to consider the properties of isosceles triangles. In an isosceles triangle, two sides are the same length, while the third side is different but must satisfy the triangle inequality. I remember that the triangle inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must always be greater than the length of the third side. I think I understand the core of the problem, but I should make sure I keep these constraints in mind.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables and Constraints**\nLet's say the two equal sides are each \\(a\\) units long, and the unique side is \\(b\\) units long. The perimeter being the sum of the sides gives us the equation:\n\\[ 2a + b = 20 \\]\n\nNow, considering the triangle inequality:\n1. \\(a + a > b\\) simplifies to \\(2a > b\\)\n2. \\(a + b > a\\) which simplifies to \\(b > 0\\)\n3. \\(a + b > a\\) is always true as long as \\(b > 0\\)\n\nRight, this already feels a bit intense. Maybe listing potential values is beneficial.\n\n\n**Step 2: Start Solving for Possible Values**\nI think I'll start by manipulating the first inequality, since it gives a direct relationship involving both variables.\n\n- From \\(2a + b = 20\\), express \\(b\\) as: \n  \\[ b = 20 - 2a \\]\n\nNow substitute \\(b\\) in the triangle inequality \\(2a > b\\):\n\\[ 2a > 20 - 2a \\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\\[ 4a > 20 \\]\n\\[ a > 5 \\]\n\n\\(a\\) has to be more than 5. I should try plugging values in for \\(a\\) starting from 6 upwards since it's an integer. Let me list these possibilities:\n\n- If \\(a = 6\\), then \\(b = 20 - 2(6) = 8\\)\n- Check triangle inequality: \\(2a = 12 > 8 = b\\), okay, this works\n\n- If \\(a = 7\\), then \\(b = 20 - 2(7) = 6\\)\n- Check triangle inequality: \\(2a = 14 > 6 = b\\), okay, this works\n\n- If \\(a = 8\\), then \\(b = 20 - 2(8) = 4\\)\n- Check triangle inequality: \\(2a = 16 > 4 = b\\), okay, this works\n\n- If \\(a = 9\\), then \\(b = 20 - 2(9) = 2\\)\n- Check triangle inequality: \\(2a = 18 > 2 = b\\), okay, this works\n\n**Step 3: More Intuition Checking**\nI think I should see if increasing \\(a\\) further would make sense:\n- If \\(a = 10\\), then \\(b = 20 - 2(10) = 0\\), which can't happen as side \\(b\\) can't be zero or negative.\n\nOkay, looks like I can't go beyond \\(a = 9\\). Everything else beyond this leads to non-triangles or non-positive side lengths.\n\n**Reflection:**\nLet's review what we have:\n1. \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 8\\)\n2. \\(a = 7\\), \\(b = 6\\)\n3. \\(a = 8\\), \\(b = 4\\)\n4. \\(a = 9\\), \\(b = 2\\)\n\nEach configuration respects the properties of an isosceles triangle and satisfies the perimeter condition. No possibility is left out since increasing \\(a\\) further results in invalid side lengths.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFour isosceles triangles with integer side lengths and a total perimeter of 20 units are possible. The triangles are defined by these combinations of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\): \n1. \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 8\\)\n2. \\(a = 7\\), \\(b = 6\\)\n3. \\(a = 8\\), \\(b = 4\\)\n4. \\(a = 9\\), \\(b = 2\\)\n\nI feel confident that these cover all the possible integer values for \\(a\\) that satisfy the problem constraints.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ denote the measure of each of the two equal sides.  Then the remaining side has measure $20-2x$ units.  By the triangle inequality, the third side must be shorter than the two equal sides combined.  In other words, $x+x>20-2x$.  Solving this inequality, we find $x>5$.  Also, the third side length has to be positive, so $20-2x>0$ which implies $x<10$.  Therefore, the $\\boxed{4}$ integers strictly between 5 and 10 are the possible integer values of $x$."
