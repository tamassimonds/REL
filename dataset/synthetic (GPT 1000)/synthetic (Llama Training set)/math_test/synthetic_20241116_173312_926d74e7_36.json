    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think it through step by step. I'll try to express my thought process as naturally as it might unfold if I were sitting down with a problem like this for the first time.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: This question involves a merry-go-round, two horses at different distances from the center making revolutions. I think this is about comparing circumferences since both horses traverse circular paths.\n\n- The horse 64 feet from the center makes 27 revolutions, and we need to determine how many revolutions a horse 16 feet from the center would need to make to cover the same distance.\n- Sounds like the problem is comparing the distances traveled via circumference calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Distance Traveled by the First Horse\n\nLet's start by calculating the distance the first horse has traveled.\n\n- Remember: Circumference of a circle \\( C = 2\\pi r \\).\n\nFor the horse 64 feet from the center:\n- Radius \\( r = 64 \\) feet.\n- \\( C = 2\\pi \\times 64 \\) = \\( 128\\pi \\) feet.\n- Distance covered in 27 revolutions = \\( 27 \\times 128\\pi \\).\n\nQuick check: Does this formula make sense? Yeah, a revolution means completing a whole trip around the circle, and multiplying the circumference by the number of revolutions gives the total distance.\n\n### Step 3: Set Up the Problem for the Second Horse\n\nNow, I need to determine how many revolutions the second horse, 16 feet from the center, would need to travel the same distance.\n\n- For the horse 16 feet from the center:\n  - Radius \\( r = 16 \\) feet.\n  - Circumference \\( C = 2\\pi \\times 16 = 32\\pi \\) feet.\n\n### Step 4: Solve for the Number of Revolutions\n\n- Let \\( n \\) be the number of revolutions the second horse makes.\n\nWe want: \n\\[ n \\times 32\\pi = 27 \\times 128\\pi \\]\n\nHmm. This looks like an equation we can solve for \\( n \\). Let's simplify:\n- Cancel \\(\\pi\\) from both sides: \n  \\[ n \\times 32 = 27 \\times 128 \\]\n\n- Solve for \\( n \\):\n  \\[ n = \\frac{27 \\times 128}{32} \\]\n\nBreak down:\n- \\( 27 \\times 128 = 3456 \\)\n- Divide by 32: \n  \\[ n = \\frac{3456}{32} = 108 \\]\n\nQuick sense check: \n- The horse closer to the center (16 feet) should make more revolutions to cover the same linear distance as the one farther out (64 feet) due to a smaller circumference. This seems reasonable.\n\n### Step 5: Reflection\n\nOkay, let's reflect: \n- All the calculations seem aligned. Using \\( C = 2\\pi r \\) seems appropriate.\n- We considered both radii and set the total distances equal, which makes logical sense.\n\nFinal Answer:\n- A horse 16 feet from the center would need to make 108 revolutions to cover the same distance as a horse 64 feet from the center making 27 revolutions.\n\nPhew! That felt like a good breakdown.",

  "ground_truth": "The radius of the circular path of the horse closer to the center is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the radius of the path of the horse farther from the center.  Since circumference is directly proportional to radius, the length of shorter path is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the length of the longer path.  Therefore, 4 times as many revolutions must be made to go the same distance, which is $27\\times4=\\boxed{108}$ revolutions."
