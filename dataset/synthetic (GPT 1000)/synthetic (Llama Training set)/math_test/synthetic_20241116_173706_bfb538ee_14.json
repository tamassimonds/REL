    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and turn our messy thoughts into some kind of order. Here\u2019s the expression we\u2019re dealing with:\n\n\\[ 8[6^2 - 3(11)] \\div 8 + 3 \\]\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n\n- As I glance at this, it feels familiar, like those order of operations problems I\u2019ve done. \n- I need to remember the order of operations here, PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\nAlright, with that in mind, let's start tackling this:\n\nStep 1: Simplify inside the brackets\n- It looks like inside the bracket, there's an exponent and a multiplication. \n- Let's deal with the exponent first: \\(6^2\\). Calculating \\(6^2\\) gives \\(36\\).\n\nStep 2: Substitute back in and think\n- Substitute \\(6^2\\) with \\(36\\) to get: \n  \\[ 8[36 - 3(11)] \\div 8 + 3 \\]\n- Now I see \\(3(11)\\) which is just a multiplication. Let's do that next.\n\nStep 3: Perform the multiplication in brackets\n- Calculate \\(3 \\times 11 = 33\\).\n- Substitute back for clarity:\n  \\[ 8[36 - 33] \\div 8 + 3 \\]\n\nStep 4: Subtract within the brackets\n- Now inside the brackets is just subtraction: \\(36 - 33 = 3\\).\n- Replace it in our expression:\n  \\[ 8[3] \\div 8 + 3 \\]\n\nStep 5: Work through the multiplication\n- Now \\(8[3]\\) is just \\(8 \\times 3\\). \n- Calculating that gives \\(24\\).\n\nStep 6: Reflect a bit\n- So, now our expression is:\n  \\[ 24 \\div 8 + 3 \\]\n- This feels right so far; operations have been straightforward.\n\nStep 7: Division first\n- According to the order of operations, handle division before addition.\n- \\(24 \\div 8 = 3\\).\n\nStep 8: Now the final addition\n- Add the leftover 3 from the previous step:\n  \\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \\]\n\nReflect and Verify:\n- Hmm, I should double-check everything. I ran through the operations carefully, kept checking my steps against the order of operations.\n- It feels like this makes sense.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe value of the original expression is \\(6\\).",
