    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I need to understand the given information thoroughly and explore potential strategies.\n\n**First Impressions:**\n\n- I see we have an invertible function \\( f(x) \\). This indicates that \\( f \\) has an inverse function denoted by \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n- The conditions \\( f(2) = 4 \\) and \\( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \\) are provided. Right off the bat, these conditions seem a bit confusing. I should take a moment to digest what they imply about the function.\n\n**Breaking It Down:**\n\n1. **Understanding \\( f(2) = 4 \\):**\n   - This tells me that when I substitute \\( x = 2 \\) into the function \\( f \\), the output is \\( 4 \\).\n   - Written as a point: \\( (2, 4) \\) is on the graph of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Understanding \\( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \\):**\n   - Since \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is the inverse of \\( f(x) \\), this means that when I input \\( 2 \\) into the inverse function, I get \\( 4 \\) as the output.\n   - This can be rewritten: \\( f(4) = 2 \\). The output \\( f(4) \\) gives the input \\( 2 \\), reversing the roles because of the inverse function.\n\n3. **Linking the Two Conditions:**\n   - With these two pieces of information together: \\( f(2) = 4 \\) and \\( f(4) = 2 \\).\n   - It seems almost like we have a \"swap\" between \\( 2 \\) and \\( 4 \\).\n\n**Considering Next Steps:**\n\nNow, I need to find the value of \\( f(f(2)) \\). Let's calculate it using the information we've gathered:\n\n4. **Calculate \\( f(f(2)) \\):**\n   \n   - We know \\( f(2) = 4 \\).\n   - Thus, \\( f(f(2)) = f(4) \\).\n   - From the previous exploration, we have determined that \\( f(4) = 2 \\) (from the inverse property).\n\n5. **Determining the Result:**\n   - Therefore, \\( f(f(2)) = 2 \\).\n\n**Checking Everything Line-by-line:**\n\n- I've broken down what the initial statements imply for the function and its inverse.\n- Substituted known values into the expression \\( f(f(2)) \\).\n- I double-checked the steps with properties of function inverses to ensure consistency.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the function properties and given values, the value of \\( f(f(2)) \\) is \\( 2 \\).\n\nReflecting on this approach, everything aligns with typical problems involving invertible functions and their inverses, confirming that no logical steps were skipped or considered incorrectly. The answer seems robust upon reevaluation.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $f(2)=f^{-1}(2)$, we can substitute $f^{-1}(2)$ freely for $f(2)$. Therefore, $f(f(2)) = f(f^{-1}(2))$, which is $\\boxed{2}$ (since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ by definition).\n\nNotice that we didn't actually need the value $4$ given in the problem."
