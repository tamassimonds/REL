    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and break it down step by step. It's always good to start by understanding the expression we need to evaluate.\n\nThe given expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{-6} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot (7-1)\n\\]\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nAs I look at this, it seems like a straightforward application of arithmetic operations, but it's important to proceed with caution. Given multiple operations including division and multiplication, I need to be mindful of the order of operations (PEDMAS/BODMAS). Also, I notice some areas that will require simplification, particularly fractional multiplication and simple subtraction within parentheses.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify each component individually.**\n\nLet's consider the multiplication and parentheses first to simplify our work:\n\n1. **Fractional Multiplication:**\n\n   - First, \\( \\frac{1}{-6} \\cdot 6 \\). My first thought is this simplifies nicely because multiplying by the reciprocal should cancel out parts of this expression. So, let's check: \n   \n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{-6} \\cdot 6 = \\frac{6}{-6} = -1\n     \\]\n\n   That part becomes \\(-1\\).\n\n2. **Parenthesis:**\n\n   - There's an operation within parentheses: \\( (7 - 1) \\), which simplifies to 6. Straightforward enough.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the remaining operations.**\n\nThe expression now is:\n\n\\[\n-1 \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot 6\n\\]\n\n3. **Order of Operations:**\n\n   - Follow the multiplication and division from left to right. \n   \n     Start with:\n     - \\( (-1) \\cdot 7 = -7 \\)\n\n     Now, handle the division:\n     - \\( 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\). Looking at this, I recognize that \\( (8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8) \\) simplifies by canceling the 8s:\n\n     \\[\n     (8 \\cdot 2) = 16 \\quad \\text{and dividing by } 8, \\quad \\frac{16}{8} = 2\n     \\]\n     \n     - Thus, the expression becomes:\n     - \\( -7 + 2 \\cdot 6 \\)\n\n4. **Final Multiplication and Addition:**\n\n   - Now handle the leftover multiplication:\n     - \\( 2 \\cdot 6 = 12 \\)\n\n   - Finally, add the results:\n     - \\( -7 + 12 = 5 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nQuick sanity check: Each operation seemed to follow from the last in a sensible way. Simplifying fractions quickly and ensuring the division was correctly reduced further ensures my confidence here. That final result of adding \\(-7\\) and \\(12\\) to get \\(5\\) makes sense given the previous steps' outputs.\n\nSo, the result of the expression is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "First, we recall that the reciprocal of a negative number is the negation of the reciprocal: $\\frac{1}{-x} = -\\frac{1}{x}$. Thus, we can rewrite $\\frac{1}{-6}$ as $-\\frac{1}{6}$. Now our expression is $-\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot (7-1)$.\n\nWe need to to what is in parentheses first, so we subtract 1 from 7 to get 6. Our expression is now $-\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot 6$.\n\nBecause multiplication and division is performed before addition and subtraction, we multiply and divide first, going from left to right. A number times its reciprocal is one, so our expression is $(-1) \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot 6$. Multiplying and dividing from left to right, we find  \\begin{align*}\n(-1) \\cdot 7 + 8 \\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot 6 &= (-7) + 8\\cdot 2 \\div 8 \\cdot 6 \\\\\n&= (-7) + 16 \\div 8 \\cdot 6 \\\\\n&= (-7) + 2 \\cdot 6 \\\\\n&= (-7) + 12.\n\\end{align*}Now, completing the addition, our answer is $\\boxed{5}$."
