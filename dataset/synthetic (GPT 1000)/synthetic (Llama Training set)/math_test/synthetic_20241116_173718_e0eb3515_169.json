    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with a clear and methodical approach. I'll start by taking a moment to understand the problem and what it wants us to solve.\n\n**Understanding the problem:**\n\nWe have 8 light switches in a row, and each switch controls a different bank of lights in the school gymnasium. Our goal is to find how many ways the switches can be set so that either one or two banks of lights are on. \n\nThis translates into either having exactly one light switch turned on, or having exactly two light switches turned on. \n\n**Initial thoughts:**\n\nThis reminds me of problems where we need to select k items from a total of n, which often involves combinations. It seems like a problem that involves counting combinations using binomial coefficients.\n\n**Brainstorming possible approaches:**\n\n1. **Combinatorial counting:** Consider counting how many ways we can turn on exactly one switch first, then count how many ways we can turn on exactly two. This seems quite direct.\n\n2. **Exhaustive listing:** Manually listing out all combinations might help, but with 8 switches, this seems inefficient.\n\n3. **Symmetry or recursive approach:** Since the problem involves binary choices (on/off) for each switch, there might be a recursive or symmetric property, though it doesn't immediately jump out at me.\n\nLet's further explore the first idea as it seems straightforward and practical.\n\n**Step 1: Count ways for exactly one light on.**\n\nThinking aloud here: If we want exactly one switch on, there are 8 switches, and any one of these could be the one that's turned on. Therefore, there are 8 combinations. \n\nUsing the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Choose 1 from 8} = \\binom{8}{1} = 8\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Count ways for exactly two lights on.**\n\nFor two switches, the approach should be similar, but we choose any two from the eight available switches:\n\nUsing the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Choose 2 from 8} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Add both results together.**\n\nNow, let's add up the two results to get the total number of ways to turn on either one or two switches.\n\nTotal ways = Ways with 1 switch on + Ways with 2 switches on  \nTotal ways = 8 + 28 = 36\n\n**Reflecting on the solution:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Let me mentally revisit the problem statement and check: We only wanted one or two banks of lights on. Our counted cases (one switch on and two switches on) cover all possibilities under these criteria. The calculations also follow the combinatorial logic correctly.\n\nI think this solution feels solid. There doesn't seem to be any obvious oversight or mistake. I approached it using combinatorial counting, which suited the problem's nature well, and verified the steps as I went along.\n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nThere are 36 possible ways to set the switches so that either one or two banks of lights are on during the school dance.",

  "ground_truth": "There are two cases here. If one bank of lights is on, there are $\\binom{8}{1}=8$ ways to choose which bank of lights it is. If two banks of lights are on, there are $\\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to choose which banks of lights they are. The total number of valid settings is $8+28=\\boxed{36}$."
