  "problem": "Each of five, standard, six-sided dice is rolled once. Two of the dice come up the same, but the other three are all different from those two and different from each other. The pair is set aside, and the other three dice are re-rolled. The dice are said to show a \"full house\" if three of the dice show the same value and the other two show the same value (and potentially, but not necessarily, all five dice show the same value). What is the probability that after the second set of rolls, the dice show a full house?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. It seems important to really break it down step-by-step and to capture my thought process along the way.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nThis problem revolves around two stages of rolling dice, with the goal of achieving a \"full house\" on the reroll. At first glance, the setup feels a bit like a probability puzzle I've seen before. Since we're dealing with dice probabilities, I'll initially try to break the problem down by calculating probabilities for each stage of the roll separately. However, I need to revisit the problem statement frequently to ensure I don't miss any specifics or constraints.\n\n### Breaking Down the Problem\n\n1. **Understanding the Rolls:**\n\n   - **First Roll:** We roll five dice. The condition is that two of these dice show the same number, and the other three show all different numbers.\n   - **Second Roll:** We reroll the three dice that initially showed different numbers. Our goal is to achieve a \"full house\"\u2014three of one number and two of another (this could initially be any pair from the first roll or something newly formed after the reroll).\n\n2. **Approach Considerations:**\n\n   - This looks like a two-step probability tree. First, we identify the pair and different numbers, then we calculate how the reroll can lead to a full house.\n   - Consider possible counts and combinations. This reminds me of combinatorics problems\u2014how many ways we can choose pairs, and then determine possible outcomes of the rerolls.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate the probability of the initial setup\n\n- **Choosing which number forms the initial pair:**\n  - A die has 6 sides, so there are 6 choices for the value that will appear on two dice.\n\n- **Determining the configuration of the three different dice:**\n  - For the remaining three dice, we need them to show three different numbers that are not the same as the pair. There are 5 remaining numbers left (since one number is used for the pair).\n  - The number of ways to select 3 different numbers from these 5 is given by permutations of selecting 3 out of 5: \\( P(5,3) = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 = 60 \\).\n\n- **Probability of achieving this setup:**\n  - The probability of any two dice showing the same and others all different from each other and the pair is \\(\\frac{6}{6^5} \\times \\frac{60}{P(6,5)}\\). Calculating the probability for each arrangement is:\n  - The total number of initial configurations of the dice is \\( {5 \\choose 2} \\times 2! = 30 \\) (choosing the two dice that will be the same, order counts in the rest). So, the probability is rather calculated by the arrangement:\n  - Initial pair setup probability simplifies to \\[\\frac{6 \\times 60}{6^5} = \\frac{360}{7776} = \\frac{5}{108}.\\]  \n\n#### Step 2: Reroll the three remaining dice\n\n- **Achieving a \"full house\" on reroll:**\n\n  - **Option 1 (the original pair forms the trio):** \n    - Let's assume after re-rolling, two of the rolled dice need to match the original pair, and the third matches any of the two numbers.\n\n  - **Probability Calculation:**\n    - For each of the three dice rerolled, there is a \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) chance the die shows the same number as the pair.\n    - Full house can come from exact matches or forming a separate pair.\n\n  - **Calculate Carefully:** \n    - Calculate ways to form three same and two same: When just rerolls are same.\n      - For light calculations reflecting debug, reroll must match initial pair: \\( 3 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^3 + 2 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^2 \\right), must check carefully.\n    - Calculate total, debugging: Profoundly approximate through steps \\(\\approx 4\\).\n\nThe calculations following initial are approximate but focused to final assembly near the full house and combined stages highlighting crucial faults and checks iterating pragmatically throughout.\n\n### Double-Check and Reflect\n\n- I'll need to reflect whether this path to solution correctly parses. This problem complexity shows how broken down steps are required to convert the continuous mapping and its inherent error quick checks.\n- **Reevaluate:** I might need to refine expectations mathematically in precise accuracy.\n\nLet's double back if this detail, upon scrutiny, critically pinpoint errors or a major calculation peak to refine elegance in solving for potential clarity, iteratively towards a closer solution. This intricate mesh will predictively synchronize realizing the successful completion of aspects highlighted for full solution analysis.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculation. Let's re-evaluate and refine the steps to find a more accurate solution to this probability puzzle.\n\n### Reevaluating the Problem\n\nAfter re-examining the problem, I realized that my initial setup calculation was a bit off and lacked clarity in the rerolling phase. I'll approach the problem again with a fresh perspective and incorporate different strategies to ensure precise probability calculations.\n\n### Clarifying the Steps\n\n1. **Understanding the Rolls:**\n\n   - **First Roll Setup:** We have two dice showing the same number and three showing different numbers from the pair and each other.\n   - **Second Roll Task:** We are rerolling the three dice, aiming for a full house, wherein a full house consists of three dice showing the same value and the other two showing another same value.\n\n### Brainstorming and Strategy Exploration\n\n#### Revisiting the Probability of Full House after Second Roll\n\nTo break it down further:\n\n1. **Case 1: Forming the Full House by One Dice Matching the Pair**\n\n   - We want one of the three rerolled dice to match the initial pair. \n   - If one die matches the pair, the other two must form a pair. \n   - There are 3 ways to choose which die matches the pair.\n   - The remaining two dice have to show the same number, different from the initial pair and itself, thus 5 other options for this number.\n\n2. **Case 2: All Three Dice Showing the Same Number Not in the Original Pair**\n\n   - Alternatively, all three dice could show the same value different from the initial pair.\n   - There are 5 remaining options (as it can't be the pair\u2019s value).\n\n### Calculating Probabilities\n\n- **For the first case:** \n  - 3 ways to select the die matching the initial pair.\n  - 5 options for forming the pair with the remaining two dice.\n  - Total successful outcomes = 3 * 5 = 15 for this scenario.\n\n- **For the second case:**\n  - 5 ways for the three dice to show the same number (none from the initial pair).\n\nAdding them up:\n\n- Total successful outcomes for both cases = 15 (from Case 1) + 5 (from Case 2) = 20.\n\n### A Check on Outcomes\n\n- Additionally, consider the case where all five dice end up showing the same value, although rare, it is possible through consistent matches.\n- Adding this possibility as one successful outcome gives us a total of 21 ways to achieve a full house.\n\n### Corrected Probability\n\nTotal possible outcomes for three dice rerolled = \\(6^3 = 216\\).\n\nThus, the probability of achieving a full house after rerolling is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{21 \\text{ successful outcomes}}{216 \\text{ total outcomes}} = \\frac{7}{72}\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nUpon revisiting the steps and reevaluating with these new perspectives, I've correctly aligned with the probability principles to derive an accurate answer for this interesting probability scenario. This iterative approach emphasized the importance of reviewing and refining before arriving at a solution.",

  "ground_truth": "There are a total of $6^3=216$ possible sets of dice rolls. If one of the re-rolled dice matches the pair we set aside and the other two form a pair, we will have a full house. But we will also have a full house if all three re-rolled dice come up the same.\n\nConsider the first case. There are $3$ ways to pick which of the three dice will match a pair, and then $5$ ways to pick a value for the other two dice so that they form a pair (but don't match the first three dice), for a total of $3\\cdot 5=15$ possible outcomes, plus the outcome that all five dice match.\n\nIn the second case, we need all three dice to match each other. There are $5$ ways to pick which value the three dice will have so that they don't match the first pair, plus the outcome that all five dice match.\n\nSo there are a total of $15+5=20$ ways to get a full house without all five dice matching, added to the possibility that all five dice match, which makes $21$ ways to get a full house. So, the probability is $$\\frac{\\text{successful outcomes}}{\\text{total outcomes}}=\\frac{21}{216}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{72}}.$$"
