    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The problem asks to write the expression \\(2z^2 + 13z + 21\\) in the form \\((z + a)(2z + b)\\) and then find the value of \\(2a + b\\). To solve this, we'll need to think about how binomial products work and adjust as necessary.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The expression looks like a quadratic trinomial, which can sometimes be factored by looking for two numbers that multiply to a certain product and sum to a certain middle coefficient. \n- However, we're given a specific form, so there might be some clues about the relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n**Exploration and Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Product-Structure:**\n   - If we expand \\((z + a)(2z + b)\\), we get \\(2z^2 + bz + 2az + ab\\).\n   - This will need to equal \\(2z^2 + 13z + 21\\), meaning:\n\n     \\[\n     \\begin{align*}\n     2z^2 & : 2z^2 \\\\\n     bz + 2az & : 13z \\\\\n     ab & : 21\n     \\end{align*}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Comparison:**\n   - First, note that the coefficients of \\(2z^2\\) match, which is straightforward.\n   - The conditions \\(bz + 2az = 13z\\) and \\(ab = 21\\) need addressing.\n\n3. **Factor Pairs:**\n   - Let's consider the factor pairs of 21: \\((1, 21), (3, 7), (-1, -21), (-3, -7)\\).\n\n4. **Testing Factor Pairs:**\n   - Let's take a productive trial and error approach by using these pairs in \\(ab = 21\\).\n\n5. **First Pair: \\((1, 21)\\):**\n   - Let's set \\(a = 1, b = 21\\):\n   - Substitute: \\((z + 1)(2z + 21)\\) expands to \\(2z^2 + 21z + 2z + 21 = 2z^2 + 23z + 21\\).\n   - This doesn't match \\(2z^2 + 13z + 21\\).\n\n6. **Second Pair: \\((3, 7)\\):**\n   - Let's set \\(a = 3, b = 7\\):\n   - Substitute: \\((z + 3)(2z + 7)\\) expands to \\(2z^2 + 7z + 6z + 21 = 2z^2 + 13z + 21\\).\n   - Bingo! This matches our original expression exactly.\n\n7. **Calculate \\(2a + b\\):**\n   - Since \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 7\\), we compute:\n     \\[\n     2a + b = 2(3) + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13\n     \\]\n\n**Final Check and Reflection:**\n- I realized when factoring, it's always good to verify a few options before continuing. \n- By verifying the expanded form, everything checks out correctly.\n- The approach and the reasoning flow logically to the solution.\n\nThus, the value of \\(2a + b\\) is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",
