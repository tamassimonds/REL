    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step. We'll follow a brainstorming approach that helps ensure we understand the different elements involved.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem statement:\n\n```\n8[6^2 - 3(11)] \u00f7 8 + 3\n```\n\nThis expression includes brackets, exponents, multiplication, division, and addition. To solve it correctly, we should consider the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n### Brainstorming Different Strategies\n\n1. **PEMDAS Order of Operations**: I should tackle this step by step following PEMDAS - first handling anything in parentheses, then exponents, and so forth.\n\n2. **Simplifying Section by Section**: It might be wise to simplify within the bracket first since it's a clear contained operation, then take those results and move on.\n\n3. **Check Verbally and Conceptually**: After calculations, I'll continually refer back to PEMDAS to ensure I'm following the order properly.\n\nNow, let's proceed step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Inside the Brackets\n\nThe expression within the brackets is `6^2 - 3(11)`.\n\n- **Exponents First**: Calculate \\(6^2\\).\n  - \\(6^2 = 36\\).\n  - Hmm, that seems correct as \\(6 \\times 6\\) indeed gives 36.\n\n- **Multiplication in Brackets**: Next, tackle \\(3(11)\\).\n  - \\(3 \\times 11 = 33\\).\n  - Seems reasonable, but I'll double check: \\(11 + 11 + 11 = 33\\).\n\n- **Subtraction in Brackets**: Now, subtract 33 from 36.\n  - \\(36 - 33 = 3\\).\n  - The operations so far yield 3 inside the brackets.\n\n### Step 2: Outside the Brackets\n\nThe next step is to incorporate this back into the larger expression.\n\n- We now have: \\(8[3]\\div8 + 3\\).\n\n- **Simplifying the Bracket Expression**: Multiply 8 by the result from the bracket which is 3.\n  - \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\).\n\n### Step 3: Division Followed by Addition\n\n- **Division**: Divide the product by 8.\n  - \\(24 \\div 8 = 3\\).\n  - Looks good, as division checks out cleanly.\n\n- **Addition**: Finally, add 3.\n  - \\(3 + 3 = 6\\).\n\n### Final Thoughts and Verification\n\n- Let's quickly verify this again by retracing:\n  - Calculated \\(6^2 = 36\\).\n  - Calculated \\(3 \\times 11 = 33\\).\n  - Subtraction led to 3.\n  - Multiplied 8 by 3 to get 24.\n  - Division returned 3, added to arrive at 6.\n\nThe step-by-step checks and logical reasoning seem sound. Thus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]",
