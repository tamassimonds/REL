    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, this looks like a problem involving a right triangle and medians, which is a fairly common geometry exercise. Here's what initially stands out to me:\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n\n1. **Triangle Dimensions:**\n   - We have a right triangle \\(\\triangle ABC\\).\n   - The legs are \\(AB = 4\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(BC = 2\\).\n   - The right angle is at \\(B\\), making \\(AC\\) the hypotenuse.\n\n2. **Median:**\n   - We need to find the length of the median \\(BM\\). \n   - In a triangle, a median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.\n\n3. **Reflecting on Problem Type:**\n   - This looks like a geometry problem that's likely solvable with some coordinate geometry or properties of medians.\n\n### Brainstorming Solutions:\n\n1. **Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   - This seems useful for finding the hypotenuse \\(AC\\). \n   - For right triangle \\(\\triangle ABC\\), \\(AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2\\).\n   - Calculate \\(AC\\) because knowing all sides might help with finding the median.\n\n2. **Median Formula:**\n   - There is a formula for the median \\(m\\) of a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\): \n     \\[\n     m_a^2 = \\frac{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}{4}\n     \\]\n   - However, this applies when we know or can easily find a midpoint, which might want checking.\n\n### Calculations:\n\n1. **Finding \\(AC\\) Using Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   \\[\n   AC = \\sqrt{(4\\sqrt{2})^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{32 + 4} = \\sqrt{36} = 6\n   \\]\n   - So, \\(AC = 6\\).\n\n2. **Median \\(BM\\):**\n   - Since \\(AC = 6\\), the midpoint \\(M\\) of \\(AC\\) would divide it equally, giving \\(AM = MC = 3\\).\n   - Apply the median formula where \\(b = AB = 4\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(c = BC = 2\\), and \\(a = AC = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     BM^2 = \\frac{2(4\\sqrt{2})^2 + 2(2)^2 - 6^2}{4}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate:\n     \\[\n     BM^2 = \\frac{2(32) + 8 - 36}{4} = \\frac{64 + 8 - 36}{4} = \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n     \\]\n   - So, \\(BM = \\sqrt{9} = 3\\).\n\n### Conclusion and Reflection:\n\n- **Correctness:** The steps show consistency with known properties of medians in a triangle, and the calculations check out. \\(BM = 3\\) is a reasonable length, fitting \\(M\\) perfectly with median properties.\n  \n- **Alternate Checks/Thoughts:** \n  - If doubting involved calculations, consider trying other verification approaches, such as placing \\(\\triangle ABC\\) in a coordinate plane or reassessing via geometric properties.\n\nOverall, the method and calculations seem sound. The length of the median \\(BM\\) is correctly found to be 3.",

  "ground_truth": "First, it is probably a good idea to sketch our triangle: [asy]\npair A, B, C, M;\nA = (0, 5.657);\nB = (0, 0);\nC = (2, 0);\nM = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * C;\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(B--M);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$M$\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$4\\sqrt{2}$\", A--B, W);\nlabel(\"$2$\", B--C, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,B,C,10));\n[/asy] Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = 32 + 4 = 36,$ so $AC = 6.$ Since $\\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle, $BM = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AC = \\boxed{3}.$"
