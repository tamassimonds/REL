    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step by thoroughly exploring it and reflecting on our process:\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine what day of the week Carlos Montado will be 706 days old. He was born on Saturday, November 9, 2002. This initially reminds me of how Elliott's birthday problems often involve calculating days elapsed since a given date.\n\n2. **Thinking About Strategies**: \n   - One strategy is straightforward: count 706 days from the given date, day by day. However, that's impractical and time-consuming.\n   - Instead, we can calculate the number of whole weeks in those 706 days and find the remainder to determine the day of the week.\n   - This process is simpler if we consider the number of days in a month and how to handle leap years.\n\n3. **Setting Up a Plan**: \n   - Calculate 706 modulo 7 to determine how many days will go beyond full weeks.\n   - This will directly give us the offset from a Saturday.\n\n4. **Calculating the Days Elapsed**:\n   - 706 days \u00f7 7 days/week = 100 weeks remainder 6 days.\n   - So, 706 days is 100 complete weeks and 6 additional days.\n\n5. **Reflecting on Days of the Week**:\n   - Carlos was born on a Saturday. After 100 weeks, it\u2019s still a Saturday.\n   - Adding 6 days to Saturday lands us on the next Friday.\n\n6. **Checking the Leap Year Element**:\n   - Between November 9, 2002, and the 706-day milestone, we might pass through a leap year (2004), exemplifying:\n     - Full 2003 year with 365 days.\n     - 2004 having 366 days due to being a leap year.\n   - Still, since we're only using the direct modulo and weeks calculation method, we don\u2019t need to adjust for specific leap year days as we directly accounted for additional days.\n\n7. **Considering if Any Other Method Is Simpler**:\n   - An alternative could be using a perpetual calendar tool or referencing an online day-of-the-week calculator, but our manual calculation should be sufficient for understanding.\n\n8. **Final Check and Confirmation**:\n   - Run through the thought process again: born on a Saturday, 100 weeks later is a Saturday, plus 6 days leads us to Friday. It logically checks out.\n   \n**Conclusion**:\n\n- **Answer**: Carlos will be 706 days old on a **Friday**.\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures we've covered all necessary possibilities, double-checked our methods, and landed on what seems to be the correct conclusion.",
