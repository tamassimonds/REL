    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Initially, this looks like we're dealing with a standard form of a parabola equation, \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\). The information given is about the vertex and the \\( x \\)-intercepts. Let's take it step by step to discover which coefficients must be positive.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts: The problem gives us the vertex of the parabola, \\((4, -5)\\), which suggests that the parabola's equation could be expressed in vertex form: \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex. Here, \\( h = 4 \\) and \\( k = -5 \\).\n\nWe can express this as:\n\\[ y = a(x - 4)^2 - 5 \\]\n\nSince the parabola has two \\( x \\)-intercepts, one positive and one negative, this information indicates that it opens upwards (U shaped) because it crosses the x-axis twice. This suggests that the coefficient \\( a \\) is positive, since only an upward opening parabola like this will have such intercepts while having a minimum point at its vertex.\n\n**Step 2: Reflect on Significant Coefficients**\n\nWe know that a parabola that opens upwards and has two \\( x \\)-intercepts means the leading coefficient, \\( a \\), is positive. This reflection backs up my initial thought process about \\( a \\).\n\n**Step 3: Converting to Standard Form**\n\nTo determine the values or signs of other coefficients, I'll expand the vertex form into the standard form:\n\\[ y = a(x - 4)^2 - 5 \\]\n\\[ = a(x^2 - 8x + 16) - 5 \\]\n\\[ = ax^2 - 8ax + 16a - 5 \\]\n\nThis expansion gives us \\( a \\), \\( -8a \\) as the coefficient of \\( x \\), and the constant term \\( 16a - 5 \\) as \\( c \\).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Coefficients**\n\n- We have already determined that \\( a \\) should be positive for the parabola to open upwards.\n- For \\(-8a\\) as the coefficient of \\( x \\), its sign depends on the positivity of \\( a \\), so it should be negative since \\( a \\) is positive.\n- \\( c = 16a - 5 \\): Whether \\( c \\) is positive depends on the value of \\( a \\).\n\nChecking \\( c = 16a - 5 \\):\n- If \\( a \\) is sufficiently large, then \\( c \\) could be positive.\n- However, there is no strict requirement for \\( c \\) to be positive since the parabola's \\( x \\)-intercepts and shape (from \\( a \\)) don't depend on \\( c \\)'s sign alone.\n\nGiven this understanding, I conclude the coefficients that must be positive based strictly on requirements are:\n\n**Final Reflection: Why \\( a \\) Is Definitely Positive**\n\nThis follows because:\n- The parabola must open upwards to match the \\( x \\)-intercept condition given the vertex: only a positive \\( a \\) ensures this.\n\nNo absolute necessity has been established for explicitly \\( b \\) or \\( c \\) being positive in every valid scenario without additional constraints.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\\[ \\text{Answer: } a \\]",

  "ground_truth": "The $y$-coordinate of the vertex is negative, and there are two $x$-intercepts, so the parabola must be upward facing, which means that $a$ must be positive.    Furthermore, one $x$-intercept is positive and the other is negative, so the $y$-intercept $c$ must be negative.\n\nThe $x$-coordinate of the vertex is positive, which is also $-\\frac{b}{2a}.$  Since $a$ is positive, $b$ is negative.\n\nTherefore, the only coefficient that must be positive is $\\boxed{a}.$"
