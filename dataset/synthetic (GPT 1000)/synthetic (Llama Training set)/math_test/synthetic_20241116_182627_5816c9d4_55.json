To entice customers, he wants to put a \"$25\\%$ off'' tag on the shoes but he still wants the customer to pay $\\$60$ for the shoes. He raises the price of the shoes so that after the $25\\%$ discount the shoes will cost $\\$60$. In dollars, what must the new price of the shoes be before the discount?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. \n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - Sam wants to sell a pair of shoes for $60 after offering a 25% discount.\n   - The trick here is that the discounted price should be $60, so the original price must be higher than this before applying the discount.\n\n2. **Initial Brainstorming:**\n   - This looks like a reverse problem of applying a discount. Normally, you have an original price, apply a discount, and find the new price. Here, we have the discounted price and need to find the original price.\n   - I need to figure out what price, when reduced by 25%, equals $60.\n\n3. **Different Strategies:**\n   - Use a simple algebraic equation: If \\( x \\) is the original price, then after a 25% discount it becomes 75% of \\( x \\) and should equal $60.\n   - Alternatively, I could think about increasing the $60 back to its original price before the discount was applied.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - The problem states that after a 25% discount, the customer pays $60. This means the customer is paying 75% of the original price.\n   - We can express this as \\( 0.75 \\times x = 60 \\), where \\( x \\) is the original price before the discount.\n\n2. **Solve the Equation:**\n   - To find \\( x \\), I'll divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{60}{0.75}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Perform the Calculation:**\n   - Division time: \\( 60 \\div 0.75 \\).\n   - Hmm, how do I approach this division? One way is to multiply the numerator and denominator by 100 to make the division easier:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{60}{0.75} = \\frac{6000}{75}\n     \\]\n   - Now, divide 6000 by 75:\n     - Breaking down 6000: I know that 75 goes into 1000 exactly 13 times with a remainder (since \\( 75 \\times 13 = 975 \\)).\n     - There are six 1000's in 6000: \\( 75 \\times 80 = 6000 \\).\n     - Therefore, \\( \\frac{6000}{75} = 80 \\).\n\n4. **Reflection:**\n   - Ok, the calculation seems reasonable. The original price should be $80 because $80 minus 25% of $80 ($20) equals $60.\n\n5. **Quick Sanity Check:**\n   - Calculate 25% of $80: \\( 0.25 \\times 80 = 20 \\)\n   - Subtract the discount from the original price: \\( 80 - 20 = 60 \\)\n   - The numbers check out. This feels right.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe new price of the shoes before the discount must be $80. That way, after a 25% discount is applied, the customer will indeed pay $60. This approach feels solid, and the answer checks out logically and mathematically.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the new price of the shoes be $x$. We are told that after a $25\\%$ discount, the shoes cost 60 dollars. Thus, $\\frac{3}{4}x = 60$. It follows that $x = \\boxed{80}$."
