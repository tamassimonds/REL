    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive right into this problem by breaking it down step by step, starting with my initial thoughts.\n\n### First Thoughts\n- **Understanding the Problem:** We have a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and we need to find \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\((x \\mathbf{I} + y \\mathbf{A})^2 = \\mathbf{A}\\). \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is the identity matrix, and the given matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a rotation matrix with a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.\n- **What does this remind me of?** This looks similar to problems involving matrix equations and identities. It also feels a bit like a problem where we might need to use eigenvalues or directly solve using algebraic manipulation.\n\n### Initial Brainstorming\n1. **Expression of \\((x \\mathbf{I} + y \\mathbf{A})\\):** \n   \\[\n   x \\mathbf{I} + y \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ -y & x \\end{pmatrix}.\n   \\]\n   This is a good starting point because now we can explore squaring this matrix.\n\n2. **Matrix Squaring:**\n   Let's compute \\((x \\mathbf{I} + y \\mathbf{A})^2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ -y & x \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\\\ -y & x \\end{pmatrix}.\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\begin{pmatrix} x^2 - y^2 & 2xy \\\\ -2xy & x^2 - y^2 \\end{pmatrix}.\n   \\]\n   This needs to equal \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), which is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n3. **Setting Up Equations:**\n   Aligning \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x^2 - y^2 & 2xy \\\\ -2xy & x^2 - y^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\), we get two sets of equations:\n   - \\(x^2 - y^2 = 0\\)\n   - \\(2xy = 1\\)\n\n### Solving the Equations\n- **Equation 1:** \\(x^2 - y^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = y^2\\). Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive, we have \\(x = y\\).\n- **Equation 2:** \\(2xy = 1\\).\n\nSubstitute \\(x = y\\) into \\(2xy = 1\\):\n\\[ \n2x^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow x^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\, y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\n### Reflection and Checking\n- **Check the consistency:** By substituting back into both equations, they match, which is reassuring.\n- **Does the result make sense?** Yes, given both equations are satisfied, and \\(x = y\\) fits naturally with the structure of the original matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe ordered pair that satisfies the equation is \\((x, y) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\). \n\nFinal step: Reflect if there could possibly be another solution or if the algebra holds up. I think everything's accounted for since positivity constraints lead straightforwardly to unique solutions here.\n\nThis was a great exercise in systematically solving a matrix polynomial identity.",
