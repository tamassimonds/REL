    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and explore it step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's understand what is being asked. We need to find \\(f(n)\\), which returns the number of times \\(n\\) appears in Pascal's Triangle. We are asked to find the minimum value of \\(f(n)\\) for any positive integer \\(n\\). The minimum value should mean we're looking for the smallest non-zero occurrence of a number in Pascal's Triangle.\n\n#### Thoughts:\n\n- Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row. The triangle starts with 1 at the top and all edges are 1.\n- Numbers inside the triangle (not on the edges) have more complex combinations.\n- Each number in Pascal's Triangle is a binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\).\n\n### Initial Investigations\n\nLet's start with small values of \\(n\\) in Pascal's Triangle to observe the frequency of numbers:\n\n- Row 0: \\(1\\)\n- Row 1: \\(1, 1\\)\n- Row 2: \\(1, 2, 1\\)\n- Row 3: \\(1, 3, 3, 1\\)\n- Row 4: \\(1, 4, 6, 4, 1\\)\n- Row 5: \\(1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1\\)\n\n#### Observations:\n\n- 1 appears very frequently, on every edge and every row.\n- Numbers like 2, 3, 4 appear twice in the symmetric positions (e.g., \\(f(3) = 2\\)).\n- The central numbers like 6 and 10 appear once in the respective rows when they are first encountered.\n\n### Hypothesis Formation\n\nLooking at the pattern, my initial hypothesis is:\n\n- Single appearance for numbers might happen as numbers get larger and only first appear in specific positions in Pascal's Triangle.\n\nLet's advance this hypothesis by considering numbers and their combinations:\n\n### Deeper Analysis\n\nWhat if we examine combinations, focusing on when \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) results in numbers appearing minimally?\n\n#### Strategy:\n\nSince the smallest numbers are repeated due to symmetry, let's examine when simple numbers appear in a non-repeated manner - specifically central combinations.\n\nConsider:\n- The central number in each row is where \\(\\binom{n}{k} = nC\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)\\) when \\(n\\) is even, or similar ratios for near central terms when \\(n\\) is odd.\n\n### Verifying the Hypothesis\n\nLet's pick a few combinations:\n- \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\binom{5}{2} = 10\\)\n- Both 6 and 10 appear once, hinting they could be among candidates for our minimum \\(f(n)\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the exploratory analysis,\n\n- The smallest positive integer that appears exactly once in Pascal's Triangle (ignoring 1, which appears infinitely) is a good candidate for \\(f(n) = 1\\).\n\nThrough checking small cases and symmetry properties, we can argue numbers like 6, 10, etc., appear a minimal count in their row and do not reappear frequently in others, confirming our hypothesis that numbers like 6 and any central distinct high binomial terms are rare.\n\nThus, the smallest \\(n\\) for which \\(f(n) = 1\\) is something like 6, as supported by its appearance pattern in the triangle.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n- Further work can be done to prove a general pattern or engage combinatorial proofs.\n- My approach aligned with initial instincts about appearance in Pascal\u2019s combinations.\n\nThus, our answer to the minimum value of \\(f(n)\\) is 1, found in numbers like 6 (given contextually rare combination occurrence in small cases).",

  "ground_truth": "Every positive integer appears at least once; if we consider an arbitrary integer $k$, it can be written in the form $\\binom{k}{1}$. Almost all integers can be written twice, because $\\binom{k}{1} = \\binom{k}{k-1} = k$, but when $k-1 = 1$, the two occurrences overlap into one. This takes place for $k = 2$, and $2$ only appears once in Pascal's Triangle, because succeeding rows of Pascal's Triangle only contain $1$'s and numbers greater than $2$. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(n)$ is $\\boxed{1}$."
