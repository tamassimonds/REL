    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We have two nonzero complex numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and they're related by the condition that the magnitudes of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( a + b \\) are equal. Our task is to find the sum of all possible values of \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nFirst things first, when I see \\(|a| = |b| = |a + b|\\), it makes me think of vectors and geometry in the complex plane. The equality of magnitudes suggests some kind of symmetry or specific geometric configuration. Maybe the numbers are placed in such a way that they form an equilateral triangle or some symmetrical figure. \n\nI'm reminded of similar problems involving complex numbers and relationship between their representations on the Argand plane.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n- **Geometric Interpretation**: This seems promising. Given that \\(|a| = |b| = |a + b|\\), a depiction on the complex plane could give insights. If \\( |a| = |b| \\), \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are vectors from the origin with the same length. The condition \\(|a + b| = |a|\\) implies a specific angular relationship, possibly hints at rotational symmetry.\n\n- **Algebraic Approach**: Express \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) using complex numbers in terms of modulus and argument, i.e., \\( a = re^{i\\theta_1} \\), \\( b = re^{i\\theta_2} \\). Then, explore the implications of \\(|a + b| = r\\).\n\n### Start with Algebraic Geometry\n\nLet's assume \\( a = re^{i\\theta_1} \\) and \\( b = re^{i\\theta_2} \\). The equation \\( |a + b| = r \\) becomes:\n\n\\[\n|re^{i\\theta_1} + re^{i\\theta_2}| = r\n\\]\n\nSimplifying gives:\n\n\\[\nr|e^{i\\theta_1}(1 + e^{i(\\theta_2 - \\theta_1)})| = r\n\\]\n\n\\[\n|1 + e^{i\\phi}| = 1 \\quad \\text{ where } \\phi = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1\n\\]\n\nHmm, this equation indicates that the phasor \\( 1 + e^{i\\phi} \\) lies on the unit circle, implying that it is a point on the unit circle some 180 degrees opposite to the origin. This automatically implies that \\(\\phi\\) should be an angle such that \\(e^{i(\\theta_2-\\theta_1)} = -1\\).\n\n### What Does \\(\\phi = \\pi\\) Imply?\n\nIf \\(\\phi = \\pi\\), this implies:\n\n\\[ e^{i(\\theta_2)} = -e^{i(\\theta_1)} \\]\nor  \n\\[ a = -b \\]\n\nBased on the above, the configuration is such that vectors a and b are opposite on the real line or lie diametrically opposite on a circle, satisfying the triangle condition |a| = |b| = |a+b|.\n\n### Potential Realizations\n\nThis seems overly restrictive though. Back to the complex division:\n\n- If \\( \\frac{a}{b} = e^{i(\\theta_1-\\theta_2)} = -1 \\), the simplest form for analysis.\n- Other configurations could exist based on rotations.\n\n### Analyze \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) and Sum\n\nThe value \\(\\frac{a}{b} = -1\\) is evident in configurations where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are collinear and of equal magnitude. If there exist other values that satisfy the geometric condition, they possibly correspond to varied angles (yet fit the symmetry of the unit circle).\n\nReflection confirms that:\n\n- \\(|a + b| = |a|\\) and \\(|a + b| = |b|\\) simplifies many setups to directly lead to only \\(-1\\).\n\nUpon further geometric or trigonometric exploration, any solutions validating \\( \\theta_1 \\) and \\( \\theta_2\\) being equidistant from zero imply \\( \\theta_1 = 0 \\), \\( \\theta_2 = \\pi \\) (or vice versa) yielding the distinct ratio \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\n### Sum of All Possible Values\n\nPer the mathematical construction, the only possible distinct solution is \\(-1\\).\n\nThus, the sum of all possible values of \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-1}\n\\]",
