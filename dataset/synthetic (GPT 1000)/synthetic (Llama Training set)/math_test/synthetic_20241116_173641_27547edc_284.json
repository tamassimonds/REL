    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. My first instinct is to explore a few different approaches to get a feel for the problem and start identifying the best path forward. This problem involves maximizing an expression under a constraint, which often suggests the use of inequalities or optimization methods. It reminds me of some problems involving AM-GM inequality or Lagrange multipliers, but let's not assume too much upfront. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding and Simplifying the Problem\n\nWe are given that \\(x, y, z \\geq 0\\) and \\(x + y + z = 3\\). We need to find the maximum value of:\n\n\\[\n(xy + z)(xz + y).\n\\]\n\nThis looks pretty symmetric, aside from how \\(z\\) appears alone in one term and \\(y\\) appears alone in the other. Immediately, I wonder if setting two variables equal might simplify things. Often, symmetry or extreme values (like 0 or all being equal due to symmetry) play a role.\n\n#### Random Insight:\n- Hmm, I feel like setting \\(x = y = z = 1\\) might be a great start because this equal distribution often yields critical insights in symmetric problems. By trying it, \\(xy + z = 1\\cdot1 + 1 = 2\\) and \\(xz + y = 1\\cdot1 + 1 = 2\\), which gives:\n\n\\[\n(xy + z)(xz + y) = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4.\n\\]\n\nThis result is a potential candidate for the maximum, but I can\u2019t just assume it\u2019s the best without proof or checking other scenarios.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring Potential Scenarios\n\n#### Strategy: Try boundary conditions and symmetry\n\nLet's see what happens as we change one variable and apply potential edge cases:\n\n1. **Case 1:** \\(z = 0\\)\n   - Then, \\(x + y = 3\\), and the expression reduces to \\((xy)(xy + y)\\).\n\nHaving \\(z = 0\\), we explore symmetry again:\n- Say \\(x = y = \\frac{3}{2}\\), then \\(xy = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{4}\\) and the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n(xy)(xy + y) = \\frac{9}{4}\\left(\\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{9}{4} \\times \\frac{15}{4} = \\frac{135}{16} \\approx 8.44,\n\\]\n\nwhich surprisingly exceeds 4! This suggests going to boundaries might work well here since symmetry around zero worked well.\n\n2. **Case 2:** \\(x = 0\\)\n   - If \\(x = 0\\), then \\(y + z = 3\\), reducing to \\((z)(y)\\).\n\nMaximizing \\(yz\\) under \\(y + z = 3\\) is straightforward via AM-GM:\n- By AM-GM, \\(y = z = \\frac{3}{2}\\) gives \\(yz = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25\\).\n\nChecking extremity helps in establishing clear bounds or knowing if symmetry is not needed entirely.\n\n### Step 3: Using Inequalities for More Precision\n\nAnother strategy might be using Cauchy-Schwarz or AM-GM indirectly, especially with constraint-friendly approaches.\n\n#### Cauchy-Schwarz Theorem:\nThis might clean the expression for direct conclusions:\n\nBy coordinates setting, \n- \\([(xy + z)^2 + (xz + y)^2] \\ge ((x + 1)(x + 1)) + ((1 + y)(1 + y))\\).\n\nIt potentially gives a hint towards expressing simply \\(x + y + z\\) and brute expanding likely drops to 9 asymptotically using these transformations. \n\n### Step 4: Final Consideration and Reflection\n\nEvery attempt here brought clarity:\n- Confirming choice \\(x = y = z = 1\\) yielding 4 matches not only but infracts tighter lines to extreme cases.\n- Carefully managing outcomes leads actual outcomes. Spending thoroughness in variables approaching constrains allows maximum testing.\n\nThus from boundary analysis, the maximum value of the expression \\((xy + z)(xz + y)\\) is ultimately:\n- **Answer:** \\(9\\).\n\nFurther checks suggest using Cauchy properly escalates: \\(x = y = \\frac{3}{2}, z = 0\\) mirrors an elevation significantly boosting to \\(9\\), \\(\\boxed{9}\\). Would verify with Lagrangian methods if needing mathematical rigor in real-time advancements elsewhere.\n\nAh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's take a step back and carefully re-evaluate our approach to identify and correct any mistakes.\n\n### Reassessing the Problem\n\nOur goal is to find the maximum value of \\((xy + z)(xz + y)\\) under the condition \\(x + y + z = 3\\) with \\(x, y, z \\geq 0\\).\n\nPreviously, I explored potential scenarios by symmetry and boundary cases but did not land on the correct maximum value. Let's re-examine the problem with this insight and attempt a more precise approach using inequalities.\n\n### Exploring a New Strategy with AM-GM Inequality\n\nGiven the symmetric nature of this problem, using the AM-GM inequality might be a very effective path. Let's analyze how AM-GM can help us break down the expression:\n\n1. **Application of AM-GM Inequality:**\n   - Recall the Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean Inequality: for non-negative numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we have:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{ab} \\leq \\frac{a + b}{2}.\n     \\]\n\n   - First, let's aim to bound \\((xy + z)(xz + y)\\) by thinking about it in terms of individual sums.\n\n#### Step 1: Apply AM-GM to the Expression\n\n- Consider \\(\\sqrt{(xy + z)(xz + y)}\\). By AM-GM:\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{(xy + z)(xz + y)} \\leq \\frac{(xy + z) + (xz + y)}{2} = \\frac{xy + z + xz + y}{2}.\n  \\]\n\n- Simplifying further, \\(\\frac{xy + z + xz + y}{2} = \\frac{(x + 1)(y + z)}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Bounding \\( (x + 1)(y + z) \\):**\n\n   - Now, apply AM-GM again:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(x + 1)(y + z)} \\leq \\frac{(x + 1) + (y + z)}{2} = \\frac{x + 1 + y + z}{2} = 2,\n   \\]\n   since \\(x + y + z = 3\\).\n\nThis implies:\n\\[\n(x + 1)(y + z) \\leq 4.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Concluding the Maximum Value\n\nSince \\((xy + z)(xz + y) \\leq \\left(\\frac{xy + z + xz + y}{2}\\right)^2 \\leq \\left(2\\right)^2 = 4\\), the maximum possible value of \\((xy + z)(xz + y)\\) is indeed 4.\n\n### Verification\n\nChecking for equality conditions in AM-GM:\n- Equality in AM-GM occurs when the terms are equal. For the maximum value to occur, we need:\n  \\[\n  (xy + z) = (xz + y) = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (x + 1) = (y + z),\n  \\]\n  which implies that \\(x = y = z = 1\\).\n\nBy assigning \\(x = y = z = 1\\), our condition \\(x + y + z = 3\\) holds, and:\n\\[\n(xy + z)(xz + y) = (1 \\times 1 + 1)(1 \\times 1 + 1) = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4.\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum value is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).\n\nThis careful re-evaluation confirms that the maximum value, considering equality cases in AM-GM, is 4, bringing to light the importance of testing symmetry and the power of inequalities in optimizing expressions under constraints.",
