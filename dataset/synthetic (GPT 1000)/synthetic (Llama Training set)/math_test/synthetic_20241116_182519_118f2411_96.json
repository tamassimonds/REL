    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Here we go with initial thoughts and brainstorming:\n\n**First Impression:**  \nThe problem seems to be about finding digits under a base conversion scenario, which often involves checking validity within the constraints of base systems. The problem states that \\((b_a)^2 = 71_a\\) where \\(b = a - 1\\). This expression means I'm dealing with numbers represented in base-\\(a\\). This means \\(b\\) and \\(a\\) are digits in this specific base, and since \\(b = a - 1\\), they must both be valid digits in the base system.\n\n**Key Points to Consider:**  \n\n1. Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are digits meaning \\(0 \\leq b < a\\).\n2. Because \\(b = a - 1\\), this implies that \\(b\\) must be the largest digit allowable in base-\\(a\\). Hence \\(a\\) must be greater than 1 because a base-1 system is not possible for this scenario.\n3. The equation \\((b_a)^2 = 71_a\\) is really saying that when \\(b\\) is squared in base-\\(10\\), it should equal the base-\\(a\\) representation of 71.\n\n**Approach:**  \n- Recognize that the base conversion means expressing 71 in base-\\(a\\): \\(71_a = 7a + 1\\).\n- So, we need to square \\(b = a - 1\\) and equate it to this expression: \\(((a-1)^2 = 7a + 1\\)).\n- This results in solving for \\(a\\) in the quadratic equation \\((a-1)^2 = 7a + 1\\).\n\n**Let's Solve the Equation:**  \n\n\\[ \n(a - 1)^2 = 7a + 1 \n\\]\n\n\\[\na^2 - 2a + 1 = 7a + 1 \n\\]\n\nSubtract \\(7a + 1\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\na^2 - 2a + 1 - 7a - 1 = 0 \n\\]\n\n\\[\na^2 - 9a = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Factoring the Quadratic Equation:**  \n\nFactor out an \\(a\\):\n\n\\[\na(a - 9) = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Find the Values for \\(a\\):**  \nThere are two solutions to this equation:\n1. \\(a = 0\\)\n2. \\(a = 9\\)\n\n**Analyzing the Solutions:**  \n- \\(a = 0\\) doesn't make sense here, as a base system can't be base 0, rules out as it's not valid in non-negative integer base systems.\n- \\(a = 9\\) is plausible as it fits a valid base system criteria.\n\n**Further Verification:**  \nIf \\(a = 9\\), then:\n\n- \\(b = a - 1 = 8\\).\n- Therefore \\(b_9 = 8\\) is to represent in base 9.\n- Computing \\(8^2\\) in base 10, which is \\(64\\).  \n- \\(71_9 = 7(9) + 1 = 63 + 1 = 64\\), which matches \\(8^2\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe calculations satisfy the problem constraints perfectly with \\(a = 9\\). We've worked through the problem methodically, checked the result, and confirmed that it's correct. So, the answer is \\(a = 9\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We begin by replacing $b$ with $a-1$, and expressing both sides in base 10: \\begin{align*} (a-1)^2\\cdot a^0&=7\\cdot a^1+1\\cdot a^0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad a^2-2a+1&=7a+1\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad a^2-9a&=0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad a(a-9)&=0\n\\end{align*}Thus, $a$ is either 0 or 9. However, since we can't have a base equal to 0, we see that $a$ must be $\\boxed{9}$."
