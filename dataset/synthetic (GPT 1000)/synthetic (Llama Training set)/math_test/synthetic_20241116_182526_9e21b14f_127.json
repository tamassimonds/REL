    "working_out": "**Brainstorming/Initial Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. Tim wants to create a circle graph, which I usually think of as a pie chart. It shows proportions as parts of a whole, so I'll need to figure out what portion the \"45-54 year-old Males\" represents of the entire group. My end goal here is to find the central angle in degrees. Each sector's angle is based on its proportion of the total, which reminds me of dividing a pie - larger portions get larger slices.\n\n**Calculating Totals:**\n\nFirst off, I'll need the sum of all physicians to understand the \"whole\" I'm dealing with:\n\n- Under 35: 53 males + 8 females = 61\n- 35-44: 155 males + 17 females = 172\n- 45-54: 145 males + 10 females = 155\n- Over 54: 98 males + 2 females = 100\n\nNow to find the total, sum these ages:\nTotal physicians = 61 + 172 + 155 + 100\n\nLet me supply a quick mental check on that total:\n- 61 + 172 = 233\n- 233 + 155 = 388\n- 388 + 100 = 488\n\nYes, that feels correct! The total number of physicians is 488.\n\n**Finding Proportion of 45-54 Year-Old Males:**\n\nNow, I need to find the proportion of 45-54 year-old males among these 488:\n- 45-54 year-old Males: 145\n\nProportion = 145 / 488\n\nLet's use a calculator to get this decimal:\n- Proportion = 145 / 488 \u2248 0.2975\n\n**Calculating the Central Angle:**\n\nSince the circle graph represents 360 degrees for the whole, I need to calculate how many degrees correspond to this portion:\n- Central angle = Proportion \u00d7 360\n\nCentral angle = 0.2975 \u00d7 360\n\nQuick reminder to myself: let's check it makes sense. A proportion of about 0.3 is roughly a third, so we'd expect it to be slightly less than 120 degrees.\n\nCentral angle \u2248 0.2975 \u00d7 360 \u2248 107.1\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nOkay! Time to double-check: does 107.1 make sense? Wouldn't be odd in context - not too big and not too small... just right for a third-ish of the pie. And, we need the nearest whole number, so I'll round this to 107 degrees. Voil\u00e0!\n\nFinal centralized angle for \"45-54 year-old Males\" sector: **107 degrees.**",

  "ground_truth": "In total there are $53+8+155+17+145+10+98+2=488$ physicians of aerospace medicine. 45-54 year-old males account for $145/488$ of this population, so they should account for that fraction of the central angle of the circle graph also. Since there are 360 degrees in the central angle to divide up among the groups, the 45-54 year-old male group should get $\\frac{145}{488}\\cdot360\\approx\\boxed{107}$ degrees."
