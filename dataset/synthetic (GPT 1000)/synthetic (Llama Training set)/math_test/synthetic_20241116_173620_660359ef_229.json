    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by brainstorming some possible approaches to tackle it:\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n1. **Recognize the Pattern**: The numerator and denominator both consist of a sequence of numbers that alternate between addition and subtraction. There's a symmetry there that might be worth exploring.\n2. **Simplification**: Attempt to simplify the expressions separately first before tackling the fraction as a whole.\n3. **Focus on Pairs**: Each pair of numbers has a subtraction action. Let's see if there's a pattern or simplicity in the pairs.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the Numerator\nNumerator: \\(2 - 4 + 6 - 8 + 10 - 12 + 14\\)\n\n- This seems to alternate starting with addition and then subtraction. Let me categorize these numbers through the operations:\n    - \\( (2 - 4) = -2 \\)\n    - \\( (6 - 8) = -2 \\)\n    - \\( (10 - 12) = -2 \\)\n    - Last number not part of a full pair: \\( + 14 \\)\n\nNow summing those:\n- Patterned pairs: \\( -2 - 2 - 2 = -6 \\)\n- Adding last number: \\( -6 + 14 = 8 \\)\n\nNumerator simplified to 8.  \n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the Denominator\nDenominator: \\(3 - 6 + 9 - 12 + 15 - 18 + 21\\)\n\n- Again, use pairs:\n    - \\( (3 - 6) = -3 \\)\n    - \\( (9 - 12) = -3 \\)\n    - \\( (15 - 18) = -3 \\)\n    - Last number not part of a full pair: \\( + 21 \\)\n\nNow summing those:\n- Patterned pairs: \\( -3 - 3 - 3 = -9 \\)\n- Adding last number: \\( -9 + 21 = 12 \\)\n\nDenominator simplified to 12.\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate the Fraction\nNow that both the numerator and the denominator have been simplified, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{8}{12} \\]\n\n#### Step 4: Simplify the Fraction\nTo simplify \\( \\frac{8}{12} \\), let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8 and 12, which is 4:\n\\[ \\frac{8 \\div 4}{12 \\div 4} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\n### Reflection\nThe key here was recognizing and simplifying the alternating pattern of addition and subtraction in both expressions. Breaking down the sequence into pairs helped simplify the arithmetic operations significantly, and attention to detail ensured the final reduction was accurate.\n\nI initially saw the problem and felt some potential complexity, but resolving it step-by-step showed a clear path to simplification. Overall, this solution seems correct and complete.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{2-4+6-8+10-12+14}{3-6+9-12+15-18+21}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\).",
