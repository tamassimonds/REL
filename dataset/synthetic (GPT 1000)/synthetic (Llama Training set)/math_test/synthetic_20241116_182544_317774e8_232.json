    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this. \n\n### First Thoughts\n\nWhen I read the problem, the phrase \"parametric curve\" stands out. This suggests the path traced by points \\((x, y)\\) is driven by the parameter \\(t\\). The problem describes the curve as a line segment, which gives me a hint that the curve will have distinct endpoints and won't loop around like some parametric curves do. I'm thinking that finding these endpoints could be key in solving this. I wonder if this connects to trigonometric identities or some geometric properties related to the cosine function.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nGiven the parametric equations \\( x = \\cos 2t \\) and \\( y = \\cos^2 t \\), I'm realizing the range for both \\(\\cos 2t\\) and \\(\\cos^2 t\\). The cosine function oscillates between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), so \\(x\\) could take values in that range. For \\(y\\), since \\(\\cos^2 t\\) is non-negative and at most 1, \\(y\\) could only be in the range from 0 to 1.\n\nHmm, maybe I should try expressing one parameter in terms of the other or see if there's a known identity that could simplify things. Another option is to differentiate these with respect to \\(t\\); maybe that would give me more insights about the properties of the parametric equations.\n\n### Strategy\n\nTo find a line segment, I'll need to see if these parametric equations can be condensed to a single equation in terms of a common variable. This usually involves eliminating the parameter \\(t\\).\n\n1. **Explore the parametric relationship:** Can we find a relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that does not involve \\(t\\)?\n2. **Consider trigonometric identities:** Is there an identity that relates \\(\\cos 2t\\) and \\(\\cos^2 t\\)?\n\nLet's try elimination of \\(t\\) using identities:\n- We know \\(\\cos 2t = 2\\cos^2 t - 1\\).\n\n### Calculating\n\nUsing \\(\\cos 2t = 2\\cos^2 t - 1\\), for our \\(x = \\cos 2t\\), we can substitute to find:\n\\[ x = 2y - 1 \\]\n\nThis shows a linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). It's forming the equation of a line: \\(x + 1 = 2y\\) or simply \\(y = \\frac{x + 1}{2}\\).\n\n### Checking and Verifying\n\nReflecting on the relationship, it implies the line derived from the parametric equations. We've allowed \\(t\\) to vary over values that \\(x = \\cos 2t\\) would produce, i.e., from \\(-1\\) to 1, covering all possible \\(x\\)-values by varying \\(t\\) within its natural trigonometric limits. Meanwhile, \\(y = \\cos^2 t\\) defines from 0 to 1.\n\nSince \\(x = 2y - 1\\), substituting the bounds of \\(y\\) (which are [0,1]) gives the maximum and minimum values of \\(x\\), confirming the endpoints are:\n- For \\(y = 0\\), \\(x = -1\\)\n- For \\(y = 1\\), \\(x = 1\\)\n\n### Finding the Length of Segment\n\nSince this is a line segment with endpoints \\((-1, 0)\\) and \\( (1, 1)\\), we apply the distance formula:\n\\[ \\text{Length} = \\sqrt{(1 - (-1))^2 + (1 - 0)^2} \\]\n\nCalculating gives:\n\\[ \\text{Length} = \\sqrt{(2)^2 + (1)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 1} = \\sqrt{5} \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter careful checks and calculations, the length of the line segment described by the parametric equations is \\(\\sqrt{5}\\). This process involved using trigonometric identities to relate the parametric equations directly, identifying endpoints, and making sure all transformations were valid. Checking calculations briefly here confirms within the bounds of cosine's behavior, which is comforting and feels quite clean as a result.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x = \\cos 2t$ and $y = \\cos^2 t$.  Then\n\\[y = \\cos^2 t = \\frac{\\cos 2t + 1}{2} = \\frac{x + 1}{2}.\\]Furthermore, $x = \\cos 2t$ varies between $-1$ and 1, so the endpoints of the line segments are $(-1,0)$ and $(1,1).$  Hence, the length of the line segment is $\\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}.$"
