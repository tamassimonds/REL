    "working_out": "Alright, let's dig into this problem step by step. My first instinct is to take apart each component of the problem and handle them one at a time. With mixed bases, it looks like an exciting problem. Let's figure out how much Kirsty owes the plumber. \n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question\n- **Initial Thoughts**: Okay, Kirsty has two charges from the plumber: hourly labor charge and equipment charge. The labor charge is given in base 5 ($242_5$) and the equipment charge in base 8 ($367_8$). The time worked is in base 10 (3.5 hours). The goal is to find the total cost Kirsty will owe in base 10.\n\n### Step 2: Conversion of Base Numbers to Base 10\n- **Labor Charge ($242_5$ to Base 10)**: \n  - My first instinct is to convert this. The base 5 number $242_5$ means: \n  \\[\n  2 \\times 5^2 + 4 \\times 5^1 + 2 \\times 5^0 \n  \\]\n  Let's calculate each part.\n  - For \\(2 \\times 5^2 = 2 \\times 25 = 50\\).\n  - For \\(4 \\times 5^1 = 4 \\times 5 = 20\\).\n  - For \\(2 \\times 5^0 = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\).\n  - Add them up: \\(50 + 20 + 2 = 72\\).\n  - **Reflection**: Alright, converting $242_5$ to base 10 gives us 72 dollars per hour.\n\n- **Equipment Charge ($367_8$ to Base 10)**:\n  - Let\u2019s see, the base 8 number $367_8$ represents:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 8^2 + 6 \\times 8^1 + 7 \\times 8^0\n  \\]\n  Let's evaluate these.\n  - \\(3 \\times 8^2 = 3 \\times 64 = 192\\).\n  - \\(6 \\times 8^1 = 6 \\times 8 = 48\\).\n  - \\(7 \\times 8^0 = 7 \\times 1 = 7\\).\n  - Adding these gives: \\(192 + 48 + 7 = 247\\).\n  - **Reflection**: Nice, I\u2019ve got the equipment charge as $247 base 10.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Labor Cost\n- **Time Worked**: 3.5 hours, okay that's straightforward in base 10.\n- **Total Labor Cost**:\n  - Hourly rate in base 10 is 72 dollars.\n  - Work duration: 3.5 hours.\n  - Total cost means multiplication: \\(3.5 \\times 72\\).\n  - Let's break it down: \n    - \\(3 \\times 72 = 216\\)\n    - \\(0.5 \\times 72 = 36\\)\n  - Therefore, the total labor cost is: \\(216 + 36 = 252\\).\n  - **Reflection**: Alright, checked and seems reasonable. The labor cost is $252 in total.\n\n### Step 4: Add Labor and Equipment Costs\n- Let's add the base 10 values for labor and equipment:\n  - Equipment cost in base 10 = 247\n  - Labor cost (from above) = 252\n  - Total cost = \\(252 + 247 = 499\\).\n  - **Quick Check**: Is this total reasonable? The way I've derived numbers looks accurate based on conversions. The arithmetic checks out.\n\n### Step 5: Confirm and Review\n- Wow! We've got the total cost Kirsty will owe as $499 dollars in base 10.\n- **Final Reflection**: All components matched up and I\u2019ve accounted for each part of the problem appropriately. I converted correctly between bases and handled the arithmetic checks. Confident that $499 is the correct answer.\n\nWhew! This problem required careful base conversions, but manual checks and thought processes helped ensure each step was dealt with correctly.",

  "ground_truth": "For every hour of labor, $242_5=2\\cdot5^2+4\\cdot5^1+2\\cdot5^0=72$. For equipment, $367_{8}=3\\cdot8^2+6\\cdot8^1+7\\cdot8^0=247$. Therefore, $3.5(72)+247=\\boxed{499}$ dollars."
