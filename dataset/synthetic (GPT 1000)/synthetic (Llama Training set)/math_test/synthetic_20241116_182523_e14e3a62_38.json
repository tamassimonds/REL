    "working_out": "Alright, let's break this down step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper or talking it through:\n\n**First Impressions:**\n\n- We've got two spinners with numbers, and we want the product of two spins to be a two-digit even number.\n- Spinner I has: 2, 3, 4, 5. Spinner II has: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. \n- These are all relatively small numbers, and I immediately notice potential for small products.\n- We're looking specifically for even numbers that are two-digit (10 to 99).\n  \n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n- Each number on Spinner I has an equal probability of being spun, as does each number on Spinner II.\n- There are 4 options on Spinner I and 5 on Spinner II, so there are 4 * 5 = 20 total possible outcomes.\n- We need those outcomes to result in something between 10 and 99 and it must be even.\n\n**Brainstorming and Initial Calculations:**\n\n- Even numbers result from multiplying an even number by any number, so focus on the even numbers first: 2 and 4 (from Spinner I).\n- Let's calculate some products:\n  1. Number 2 on Spinner I:\n     - 2 x 1 = 2\n     - 2 x 3 = 6\n     - 2 x 5 = 10\n     - 2 x 7 = 14\n     - 2 x 9 = 18\n  2. Number 4 on Spinner I:\n     - 4 x 1 = 4\n     - 4 x 3 = 12\n     - 4 x 5 = 20\n     - 4 x 7 = 28\n     - 4 x 9 = 36\n- From the above calculations, the products 10, 14, 18, 12, 20, 28, and 36 are both two-digit and even.\n\n**Reflecting and Double Checking:**\n\n- Products that are two-digit even numbers: 10, 12, 14, 18, 20, 28, 36.\n- I see 7 outcomes that meet the criteria. Let\u2019s recount the cases:\n  - With 2: 10, 14, 18\n  - With 4: 12, 20, 28, 36\n  - Yes, 7 outcomes.\n\n**Probability Calculation:**\n\n- We have 7 successful outcomes out of 20 possible outcomes.\n- Probability = Number of successful outcomes / Total possible outcomes = 7/20.\n\n**Final Consideration:**\n\n- Reflecting: All calculations seem correct. The idea of improving this could involve double-checking my multiplication and ensuring I didn't miss any two-digit even numbers.\n  \nYeah, I'm pretty confident now that I've accounted for all of the possible scenarios here and calculated them correctly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe probability that the product is a two-digit even number is \\(\\frac{7}{20}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Let results be denoted by ordered pairs where the first coordinate corresponds to Spinner I and the second coordinate corresponds to Spinner II.  Since all the section numbers on Spinner II are odd, Spinner I must given an even number in order for the product to be even. The results $(2,5)$, $(2,7)$, $(2,9)$, $(4,3)$, $(4,5)$, $(4,7)$, and $(4,9)$ are the ones whose products are two-digit even numbers.  Since there are $5\\times4=20$ equally likely results, the probability of obtaining an even two-digit product is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{20}}$."
