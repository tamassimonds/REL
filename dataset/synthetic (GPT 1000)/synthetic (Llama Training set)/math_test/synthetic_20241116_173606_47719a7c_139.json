    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with a clear, step-by-step approach. We need to solve for \\( a \\) in the equation: \\(\\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nOkay, first thoughts: This equation involves negative exponents and fractions, and we need to isolate \\( a \\). If you're like me, you might recognize this as an algebra problem where understanding and manipulating exponents will be key. Let's carefully rewrite these terms to see what we're dealing with.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Expression\n\nFirst, let's explore how negative exponents work:\n\n- \\( 8^{-1} = \\frac{1}{8} \\)\n- \\( 4^{-1} = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n\nSo, our problem \\(\\frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}}\\) becomes:  \n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{8}}{\\frac{1}{4}}\n\\]\n\nWhen dividing by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. So:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8} \\times 4 = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nOkay, I feel confident about this part; the negative exponents are now handled. Our equation now is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Isolating \\( a^{-1} \\)\n\nNow, let's focus on solving for \\( a^{-1} \\).\n\nSubtract \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) from both sides:\n\\[\n-a^{-1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n-a^{-1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(-1\\) to switch the sign:\n\\[\na^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nGreat, now let's make sure we're still on track. That step seems logical; reversing the sign should give us a correct path forward.\n\n### Step 4: Solving for \\( a \\)\n\nRemembering that \\( a^{-1} \\) is the same as \\(\\frac{1}{a}\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( a \\), we'll take the reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\\[\na = -2\n\\]\n\n### Final Check\n\nOkay, let's substitute \\( a = -2 \\) back into the original equation to verify:\n\nThe original equation is:\n\\[\n\\frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\n\\]\n\nWe calculated:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{a} = 1\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{-2} = 1\n\\]\n\nWhich gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\nThat simplifies to 1 = 1. Nice! That checks out perfectly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe value of \\( a \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( a = -2 \\). Everything seems consistent and logical, and the verification matches the original question's requirement. The calculation process turned out to be correct, confirming our solution.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we simplify the left side, using the exponent rule $x^{-1} = \\frac1x$.  We have  \\[\n\\frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = \\frac{1/8}{1/4} - \\frac1a = \\frac18\\cdot \\frac41 -\\frac{1}{a}= \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac1a,\n\\] so we can write the original equation as $\\frac12 - \\frac1a = 1$.  Subtracting $\\frac12$ from both sides gives $-\\frac1a = \\frac12$, and taking the reciprocal of both sides gives $-a = 2$.  Therefore, we have $a = \\boxed{-2}$."
