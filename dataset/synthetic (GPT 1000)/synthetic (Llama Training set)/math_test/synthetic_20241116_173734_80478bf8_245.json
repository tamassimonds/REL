    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem systematically. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe sequence \\((x_n)\\) is defined recursively, with an initial condition \\(x_0 = 3\\), and for \\(n \\geq 1\\),\n\n\\[\nx_n = \\frac{1 + x_{n-1}}{1 - x_{n-1}}\n\\]\n\nThe task is to find \\(x_{12345}\\). Hmm, recursion... this reminds me of sequences with repeated patterns or convergence properties. Let's explore that.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring the Sequence\nThe first thing that comes to mind is to compute the initial terms to see if there's a pattern. So, let's do that:\n\n- Calculate \\(x_1\\):\n\n  \\[\n  x_1 = \\frac{1 + x_0}{1 - x_0} = \\frac{1 + 3}{1 - 3} = \\frac{4}{-2} = -2\n  \\]\n\n- Calculate \\(x_2\\):\n\n  \\[\n  x_2 = \\frac{1 + x_1}{1 - x_1} = \\frac{1 - 2}{1 + 2} = \\frac{-1}{3}\n  \\]\n\n- Calculate \\(x_3\\):\n\n  \\[\n  x_3 = \\frac{1 + x_2}{1 - x_2} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{3}}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{4}{3}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- Calculate \\(x_4\\):\n\n  \\[\n  x_4 = \\frac{1 + x_3}{1 - x_3} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 3\n  \\]\n\nOh! This is interesting. \\(x_4 = 3\\), which is the initial value \\(x_0\\).\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Pattern\nNow that it seems the sequence may repeat every 4 terms, let's verify by computing \\(x_5\\), \\(x_6\\), etc.:\n\n- Calculate \\(x_5\\):\n\n  \\[\n  x_5 = \\frac{1 + x_4}{1 - x_4} = \\frac{1 + 3}{1 - 3} = -2\n  \\]\n\nAnd it matches \\(x_1\\)! Let me calculate one more to be sure:\n\n- Calculate \\(x_6\\):\n  \n  \\[\n  x_6 = \\frac{1 + x_5}{1 - x_5} = \\frac{1 - 2}{1 + 2} = \\frac{-1}{3}\n  \\]\n\nAnd this matches \\(x_2\\)! Excellent, the sequence definitely repeats every 4 terms.\n\n### Step 4: Finding \\(x_{12345}\\)\nSince \\(x_n\\) repeats every 4 terms, the sequence is periodic with period 4. Therefore:\n\n- Find where \\(12345\\) falls in the cycle: Calculate \\(12345 \\mod 4\\)\n\n  \\[\n  12345 \\div 4 = 3086 \\text{ remainder } 1\n  \\]\n\nThis means \\(12345 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}\\). \n\nSince the sequence starts at \\(x_0\\) and repeats every 4 terms (\\(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_0, x_1, \\ldots\\)), and \\(x_1 = -2\\), it follows that:\n\n\\[\nx_{12345} = x_1 = -2\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \\(-2\\).\n\n### Final Check\nThe calculations match earlier ones, and the modulo operation checks out, affirming the periodic pattern. This method seems robust for the problem, so the solution should be correct. \n\nAnswer:\n\\[\nx_{12345} = -2\n\\]",

Hence, $x_{12345} = x_1 = \\boxed{-2}.$"
