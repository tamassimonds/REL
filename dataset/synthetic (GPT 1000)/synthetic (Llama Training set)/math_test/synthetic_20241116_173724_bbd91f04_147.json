    "working_out": "First thoughts: Okay, so we have a seating problem with a circular table and members grouped by party. This sounds like a combinatorics problem, possibly involving permutations. Given the circular nature, I should consider if there's any rotational symmetry to handle.\n\nHmm, in linear arrangements, seating members of a group together usually involves treating the group as a single \"block\". But with circular arrangements, rotations can make arrangements equivalent, so that's important to consider here.\n\nThinking aloud: I remember that with circular arrangements, one way to handle the rotation issue is to fix one person's position and arrange the rest. That reduces the symmetry issue from a circular permutation to a linear one.\n\n1. Fixing the Structure: Let's start with considering the groups as \"blocks\": one block for Democrats, one block for Republicans, and one block for the Independent. In a circular arrangement, fixing one block helps handle rotational symmetry. \n\n2. Arranging Blocks: o we have three \"blocks\": Democrats, Republicans, and the Independent. There are 3 factorial (3!) ways to arrange these blocks.\n\n   - 3! = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6 ways to arrange the \"blocks\" in a circle.\n\n3. Internal Arrangement: Now, within each block (party), the members can be arranged in different ways:\n\n   - For the Democrats (5 members), there are 5! ways to arrange them within their block.\n  \n   - 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\n   - For the Republicans (5 members), similarly, there are 5! ways to arrange them.\n  \n   - 5! = 120.\n\n   - The Independent is alone, so there's only 1 way to \"arrange\" them in their block.\n\n4. Calculating Total Arrangements: The total number of different seat arrangements, considering these steps, is the product of each part:\n\n   - Total arrangements = 3! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 1\n\n   - Total arrangements = 6 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 1.\n\n   - Calculating that: 6 \u00d7 120 = 720,\n\n   - Then, 720 \u00d7 120 = 86400,\n\n   - Finally, 86400 \u00d7 1 = 86400.\n\nDeeper reflection: Since we arranged based on group placements and took care to treat each party as a block, this approach seems robust. We've incorporated rotational symmetry by using circular permutation rules, treating the blocks as distinct units first, then arranging members within them.\n\nCheck: The number seems reasonable given the relatively high degree of freedom in member placements and block arrangements. Each computation step is a common permutation calculation and seems executed correctly. I feel confident this covers the problem constraints adequately.\n\nConclusion: There are 86,400 ways for the committee members to sit around the table, respecting the given party grouping conditions and accounting for circular permutations.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem and explore some different strategies to ensure we arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nWe need to arrange a circular seating for 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent, keeping all party members together. Remember, in circular permutations, arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered the same. My earlier assumption about arranging the blocks as 3! was incorrect due to the rotational nature of the table, which I must reconsider.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n\n1. **Fixing a Position:**\n   - We can fix the position of the Independent first. This helps eliminate the rotational symmetry because the Independent acts as a fixed point.\n\n2. **Arranging the Party Blocks:**\n   - With the Independent fixed, we have two possibilities for the arrangement of the party blocks: the Democrats can sit together to the left of the Independent and the Republicans to the right, or the opposite. This gives us 2 unique block arrangements.\n\n3. **Arranging Within Each Block:**\n   - Within each party block, we can arrange the Democrats (5 members) in 5! ways and the Republicans (5 members) in 5! ways as well.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n- Total unique circular arrangements = Ways to arrange party blocks \u00d7 Ways to arrange Democrats \u00d7 Ways to arrange Republicans\n- Total unique circular arrangements = 2 \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5!\n\nCalculating these values:\n- 5! = 120, so the total calculation becomes:  \n- Total unique circular arrangements = 2 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 120 = 28,800.\n\nDeeper reflection: After fixing the Independent and considering two arrangements of the party blocks (left and right of the Independent), the problem simplifies greatly. The understanding of circular permutation as fixing one position and considering the rest in a linear fashion applies here well.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct number of ways for the committee members to sit around the table, given the constraints, is 28,800. This accounts correctly for the rotational symmetry and respects each party block's internal permutations.",

  "ground_truth": "Choose any seat in which to place the Independent -- it doesn't matter which seat that we choose, since we can rotate the table. Once the Independent's seat has been chosen, either all the Democrats sit to their left and all the Republicans sit to their right, or the other way around. Either way, there are $5!$ ways to put the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to put the Republicans in their seats. So, the total number of ways to seat the people around the table is $2\\cdot5!\\cdot5!=2\\cdot120\\cdot120=\\boxed{28800}$."
