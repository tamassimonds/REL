    "working_out": "**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The problem involves four consecutive positive even integers whose sum needs to be a perfect square. Hmm, what do I know about even integers? They're numbers like 2, 4, 6, 8,\u2014each one separated by 2. Consecutive means one follows another directly, so I'm looking at something like \\(x\\), \\(x+2\\), \\(x+4\\), \\(x+6\\). \n\nThe perfect square aspect is interesting. Perfect squares are numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc. I'm thinking I need their sum \\(x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6)\\) to match one of these.\n\n**Step-by-step Approach:**\n\n1. **Express and Simplify the Sum**:\n   The sum of the integers can be written as:  \n   \\[\n   x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) = 4x + 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set Up Equation for a Perfect Square**:\n   This equation\u2014\\(4x + 12\\)\u2014needs to equal some perfect square:  \n   \\[\n   4x + 12 = n^2\n   \\]\n   where \\(n\\) is an integer.\n\n3. **Solving for \\(x\\):**\n   Let's rearrange and solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   4x = n^2 - 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{n^2 - 12}{4}\n   \\]\n   For \\(x\\) to be an integer, \\(n^2 - 12\\) must be divisible by 4. \n\n4. **Check Values of \\(n\\):**\n   I\u2019ll test small values of \\(n\\) to find the smallest \\(n\\) where \\(x\\) remains an integer. Let's try:\n\n   - \\( n = 4 \\)\n       - \\( n^2 = 16 \\)\n       - \\( 16 - 12 = 4 \\)\n       - \\( 4/4 = 1 \\) \u2192 \\( x = 1 \\)\n       - Numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8. Sum = 20 \u2192 Not a perfect square.\n\n   - \\( n = 5 \\)\n       - \\( n^2 = 25 \\)\n       - \\( 25 - 12 = 13 \\) \n       - Not divisible by 4\n\n   - \\( n = 6 \\)\n       - \\( n^2 = 36 \\)\n       - \\( 36 - 12 = 24 \\)\n       - \\( 24/4 = 6 \\) \u2192 \\( x = 6 \\)\n       - Numbers: 6, 8, 10, 12. Sum = 36 \u2192 Bingo! \n\n**Check and Reflect:**\n\nThe sum of those integers (6, 8, 10, 12) is 36, which is indeed \\(6 \\times 6\\) or \\(6^2\\), a perfect square. This seems like a plausible answer, and attempting higher values of \\(n\\) won't yield a smaller sum, as \\(n > 6\\) would naturally give a larger set of integers and thus a larger sum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe least possible sum of four consecutive positive even integers that is a perfect square is 36.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $2n-2$, $2n$, $2n+2$, and $2n+4$ be four consecutive positive even integers. If $(2n-2)+(2n)+(2n+2)+(2n+4)=8n+4=2^2(2n+1)=m^2$ for some positive integer $m$, then $2n+1$ must be an odd perfect square. $2n+1=1^2$ gives $n=0$, which we reject because our integers are positive. $2n+1=3^2$ gives $n=4$, which yields a sum of $8\\times4+4=36$. Thus, the least possible sum is $\\boxed{36}$."
