    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this polynomial problem. The task is to find the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the polynomial product \\((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\\) that results in the polynomial \\(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\\). Our ultimate goal is to find \\(a + b\\).\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n1. **Identify the General Form:**\n   - We have a product of two quadratic polynomials expanding into a quartic polynomial.\n   - Let's write down what we know:\n     \\[\n     (3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\n     \\]\n\n2. **Identify knowns and unknowns:**\n   - The coefficients on the right-hand side (quaric polynomial) are given.\n   - We need to determine \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n**Expansion Strategy:**\n\nA common way to tackle such problems is to compare coefficients after expanding. Let's think about this:\n\n3. **Consider the highest and lowest terms:**\n   - The \\(t^4\\) term comes only from the multiplication of \\(t^2\\) terms.\n     - This is \\(3t^2 \\times 4t^2 = 12t^4\\), which checks out.\n   - The constant term involves \\(a\\) and is the product of the constants from both polynomials: \\(a \\times (-2) = 6\\).\n\n4. **Solve for known coefficients:**\n   - Constant Term: \\(-2a = 6\\)\n     - Solving: \\(a = -3\\).\n\n5. **Identify and consider uncertain/mix terms:** \n   - \\(t^3\\) term: From \\(3t^2\\) and \\(bt\\), and \\(5t\\) and \\(4t^2\\).\n     - These generate terms: \\(3t^2 \\times bt = 3bt^3\\) and \\(5t \\times 4t^2 = 20t^3\\).\n     - Combined: \\(3b + 20 = 26\\)\n     - Solve for \\(b\\): \\(3b = 6 \\Rightarrow b = 2\\).\n\n6. **Now verify a few terms to boost confidence:**\n\n- **\\(t^2\\) Coefficient check:**\n  - Contribute terms:\n    - From \\(3t^2 \\times (-2) = -6t^2\\).\n    - From \\(5t \\times bt = 5bt^2\\).\n    - From \\(a \\times 4t^2 = 4at^2\\) (We know \\(a = -3\\)) -> \\(-12t^2\\)\n  - Plugging values:\n    \\[\n    -6 + 5b - 12 = -8 \\\\\n    5b - 18 = -8 \\\\\n    5b = 10 \\\\\n    b = 2\n    \\]\n  - All checks now align.\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   - Using found values, solve \\(a + b = -3 + 2 = -1\\).\n\nThus, \\(a + b = -1\\) is our solution. Everything checks out fine for the expansion and solving stages, it feels like the available checks of coefficients logically align. We're done!",

  "ground_truth": "The constant term of the product of two polynomials is just the product of the two constant terms. Therefore we know that $6=-2a$, so $a=-3$. We now consider the linear term of the product of our polynomials. It's given by $-16t=(5t\\cdot-2)+a\\cdot bt\\Longrightarrow-16t=-10t+(-3)bt\\Longrightarrow b=2$. Therefore our answer is $a+b=\\boxed{-1}$."
