    "working_out": "Alright, let me dive into this problem of finding the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(10x^3-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^{5}\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nHmm... okay, we're looking at a binomial expansion where each term is of the form \\(\\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\\). I recognize this from previous problems where I've dealt with binomial expansions. Each term in the expansion will be composed of exponents of \\(x\\), and our goal here is to find the constant term, where the exponent of \\(x\\) is zero.\n\n### Strategy Brainstorm\nFirst, I should just try writing out a general term from this expansion:\n- \\((10x^3)^k\\) results in \\(10^k x^{3k}\\)\n- \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^{5-k}\\) results in \\((-1)^{5-k}(2^{-1})^{5-k}x^{-2(5-k)}\\)\n\nCombining these, the term looks like:\n\\[ \\binom{5}{k} (10^k x^{3k}) ((-1)^{5-k} (2^{-1})^{5-k} x^{-2(5-k)}) \\]\n\n### Checking Each Element\nOh! I need to consider the powers and see when the overall exponent for \\(x\\) is zero:\n- The power of \\(x\\) in \\((10x^3)^k\\) is \\(3k\\).\n- The power of \\(x\\) in \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^{5-k}\\) is \\(-2(5-k)\\).\n\nNow I'll set the sum of these exponents to zero:\n\\[ 3k - 2(5-k) = 0 \\]\n\n### Solving for \\(k\\)\nLet's simplify this equation:\n\\[ 3k - 10 + 2k = 0 \\]\n\\[ 5k = 10 \\]\n\\[ k = 2 \\]\n\nOkay, \\(k = 2\\) is the solution for ensuring the x term cancels out.\n\n### Substitution for the Constant Term\nLet's go back and plug \\(k = 2\\) into the term:\n\\[ \\binom{5}{2} (10^2 x^6) \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 x^{-6} \\]\n\nFurther calculating each part:\n1. \\(\\binom{5}{2} = 10\\)\n2. \\(10^2 = 100\\)\n3. \\(\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = -\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n\nCombining these:\n\\[ 10 \\cdot 100 \\cdot -\\frac{1}{8} \\]\n\n### Calculating the Final Result\nNow for the arithmetic:\n\\[ 1000 \\cdot \\frac{-1}{8} = -125 \\]\n\n### Reflection and Check\nAlright, that makes sense. I've correctly solved for when the exponent of \\(x\\) equals zero to get the constant term and combined the terms correctly. My calculations show that the constant term in the expansion is \\(-125\\). I've checked my arithmetic a couple of times to ensure there aren't any small mistakes there.\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(-125\\). That should be the final answer but let's think through the logic again once more to ensure no steps were skipped or misunderstood beyond my initial checks. Everything aligns, and the method worked as intended for this kind of algebra problem. Yeah, I feel confident with that final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "To get a constant term, the exponents of $x$ must cancel.  If we take the term with 2 $x^3$'s and 3 $\\frac{1}{x^2}$'s, then they will cancel.  By the Binomial Theorem, this term is $$\\binom52 (10x^3)^2\\left(-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^3=10\\cdot100\\cdot-\\frac{1}{8}\\cdot x^6\\cdot\\frac{1}{x^6}$$$$\\Rightarrow \\frac{1000}{-8}=\\boxed{-125}$$"
