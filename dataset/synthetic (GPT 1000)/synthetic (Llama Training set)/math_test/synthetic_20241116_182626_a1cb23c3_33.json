    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together and work through it step-by-step, just as if we were tackling it in real time.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nThe question asks for the smallest 3-digit number of the form \\(aaa\\) that is divisible by 9. Immediately, the structure of the number \\(aaa\\) comes to mind, where \\(a\\) is a single digit from 0 to 9. This type of number always has the form \\(111a\\) because it can be expressed as \\(100a + 10a + a = 111a\\). \n\n### Strategy Brainstorm\n1. Recognize patterns: Start by listing a few examples to see patterns. For example, numbers like 111, 222, 333, etc.\n2. Use a rule of divisibility for 9: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n3. Simplify using arithmetic: Since \\(aaa\\) is in the form \\(111a\\), check divisibility for \\(111a\\).\n\n### Thought Process\n1. **Understanding the divisibility by 9 rule**: The sum of the digits of a number must be divisible by 9. For \\(aaa\\), the sum of the digits is \\(3a\\).\n2. **Express \\(aaa\\) as mathematics**: So, \\(aaa = 111a\\).\n3. **Check smallest \\(a\\)**: We want the smallest 3-digit number \\(111a\\) divisible by 9. Thus, \\(3a\\) should be a multiple of 9.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n1. \\(3a\\) must be a multiple of 9. Let's start evaluating:\n   - If \\(a = 1\\), \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\), not divisible by 9.\n   - If \\(a = 2\\), \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\), still not divisible by 9.\n   - If \\(a = 3\\), \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\), which is divisible by 9. This is promising.\n\n2. **Verify**:\n   - If \\(a = 3\\), then \\(111a = 111 \\times 3 = 333\\).\n   - Let's confirm: the sum of digits in 333 is \\(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\\). \n\n### Cross-check\n1. **Check smaller \\(a\\)**: It seems \\(a = 3\\) is the first instance adhering to divisibility by 9 for \\(aaa\\).\n2. **Verify \\(333\\) for 9**: Sum calculated as 9 which divides evenly.\n\n### Conclusion\nAt this point, everything reconciles. The smallest 3-digit number of the form \\(aaa\\) that is divisible by 9 is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{333} \\]\n\nReflecting on the solution, each strategy and calculation aligns correctly with divisibility rules, ensuring no steps were bypassed. If this were an exam, this thought process, from brainstorming to final check, effectively leads to the correct and corroborated answer.",

  "ground_truth": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. If the number is of the above form, then the sum of its digits is $a+a+a=3a$. The smallest value of $a$ for which 9 divides $3a$ is $a=3$. Therefore, $\\boxed{333}$ is the smallest 3-digit number of the form $aaa$ which is divisible by 9."
