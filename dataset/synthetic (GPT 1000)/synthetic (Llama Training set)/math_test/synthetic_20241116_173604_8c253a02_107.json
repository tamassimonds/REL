    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\nThis looks like a problem involving finding the domain of a combined function. The function is composed of a square root and a nested square root expression. This reminds me of problems where you have to ensure the expressions under square roots are non-negative for them to be defined. \n\nStarting with brainstorming:\n\n1. **Break Down the Function**: The function \\( h(x) = \\sqrt{25-x^2} + \\sqrt{-(x-2)} \\) is a sum of two parts, each with a square root. The domain of each part will influence the domain of \\( h(x) \\) as a whole.\n\n2. **Consider \\( \\sqrt{25 - x^2} \\)**: This is a standard square root expression, which requires the argument \\( 25-x^2 \\geq 0 \\). I recognize this as the equation of a circle \\( x^2 \\leq 25 \\), meaning \\( -5 \\leq x \\leq 5 \\).\n\n3. **Consider \\( \\sqrt{-(x-2)} \\)**: This is a bit tricky. The argument \\( -(x-2) = 2-x \\) must be non-negative for the square root to exist. This means \\( 2-x \\geq 0 \\), or equivalently, \\( x \\leq 2 \\).\n\nReflection on each condition:\n\n- For \\( \\sqrt{25-x^2} \\), \\( x \\) is bounded between -5 and 5.\n- For \\( \\sqrt{-(x-2)} \\), \\( x \\) must be less than or equal to 2.\n\nHmm, let's stop for a quick reflection: both conditions need to be satisfied simultaneously for the function \\( h(x) \\) to be defined. Combining these gives the condition \\( -5 \\leq x \\leq 2 \\).\n\nLet's Check If My Approach Makes Sense:\n\n- We derived the condition from both parts of the function and combined them logically.\n- This seems like the right path because the combined domain condition reflects where both roots can be non-negative.\n\nConsider the width of the Interval:\n\n- The interval where \\( h(x) \\) is defined is \\( [-5, 2] \\).\n- The width of this interval can be found by subtracting the endpoints: \\( 2 - (-5) = 7 \\).\n\nQuick Verification:\n\n- Double-check the calculations for the interval width. It seems right.\n- Re-examined the conditions from both square roots, ensuring no oversight.\n\nFinal Reflection:\n\nYes, all parts make sense. There's no overlap with these conditions due to their simplicity. The interval checks out perfectly.\n\nSo the width of the domain of \\( h(x) = \\sqrt{25-x^2} + \\sqrt{-(x-2)} \\) is **7**.",
