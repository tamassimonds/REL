    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving how many distinct arrangements there are of the word \"PAPA.\" \n\n**Initial Thoughts and Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **First Impressions:**\n   - \"Okay, this is about arranging letters, which reminds me of permutations and combinations.\"\n   - \"The word 'PAPA' is made up of 4 letters, but I notice there are repeating letters 'P' and 'A'. This means not all arrangements will be distinct.\"\n\n2. **Approach Ideas:**\n   - \"I could start by considering if all letters were unique, and then adjust for the repeats.\"\n   - \"Another way is to directly calculate with the repetitions factored in.\"\n\n3. **Initial Confusion and Consideration:**\n   - \"Hmm, if these were all different letters, it would simply be 4 factorial (4!) arrangements because there are 4 letters.\"\n\n**Calculations and Adjustments:**\n\n1. **If All Letters Were Unique:**\n   - \"Calculating 4! gives 24 arrangements, which is what it would be without repeats.\"\n\n2. **Adjusting for Repeating Letters:**\n   - \"Since there are 2 'P's and 2 'A's, the repeats mean some of those 24 are duplicates.\"\n   - \"I remember a method involving dividing by the factorial of the counts of repeated letters.\"\n\n3. **Using the Formula for Permutations with Repetitions:**\n   - The formula is: \\(\\frac{n!}{n_1! \\times n_2! \\times \\ldots}\\) where \\(n\\) is the total number of letters, and \\(n_1, n_2, \\ldots\\) are the counts of each repeating letter.\n   - For \"PAPA\": \n     - Total letters (\\(n\\)) = 4.\n     - Count of 'P's (\\(2!\\)) and 'A's (\\(2!\\)).\n   - So, \\( \\frac{4!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\).\n\n**Reflection and Checks:**\n\n1. **Checking Each Step:**\n   - \"Alright, does this make sense? With repeats, the distinct arrangements get reduced, since permutations like 'PAPA' and 'PAPA' are identical.\"\n   - \"The formula seems correct, the logic matches, and dividing by the factorials of the repeated counts correctly reduces the count.\"\n\n2. **Quick Verification:**\n   - \"If I list some out, do they match? Let's check: PAPA, PAAP, APAP, AAPP, APPA, PAP.\"\n   - \"Yes, these seem correct and they total 6.\"\n\n3. **Final Consideration:**\n   - \"This is likely right since the approach using permutations and adjusting for repeats is a standard method. I don't see any errors in the formula application.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe distinct arrangements of the word \"PAPA\" are 6 in total. This was reached by applying permutations with repeats, adjusting for duplicate letters. The steps appear to reflect the correct reasoning process for tackling this permutation problem involving repeating elements.",

  "ground_truth": "We pretend that the letters are all different, and we have P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$.  We have $4!$ permutations (since all the letters are different).\n\nBut how many arrangements of P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$ (where the P's and A's are considered different) correspond to a single arrangement of PAPA (where the P's and A's are identical)?  PAPA is counted in 4 different ways: as P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$, P$_1$A$_2$P$_2$A$_1$, P$_2$A$_1$P$_1$A$_2$, and P$_2$A$_2$P$_1$A$_1$.  Rather than list out the possibilities, we could have reasoned as follows: For the 2 P's, each possibility is counted $2! = 2$ times, and for the 2 A's, each of these 2 possibilities is counted $2! = 2$ times, for a total of $2 \\times 2 = 4$ ways. (Make sure you see why it isn't $2+2 = 4$ ways.) Therefore, there are 4! ways to arrange the 4 letters P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$; this counts each arrangement of PAPA $2! \\times 2! = 4$ times, so we have $4!/(2! \\times 2!) = \\boxed{6}$ ways to arrange PAPA."
