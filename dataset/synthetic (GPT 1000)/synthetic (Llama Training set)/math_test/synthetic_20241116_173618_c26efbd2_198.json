    "working_out": "Great, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking through it as we go along.\n\n**First Thoughts and Initial Brainstorming:**\n\nOkay, so we have two integers, and they need to satisfy three different modular conditions: \n\n- When divided by 4, the remainder is 3.\n- When divided by 3, the remainder is 1.\n- When divided by 5, the remainder is 1.\n\nThis reminds me of problems dealing with systems of congruences or the Chinese Remainder Theorem. However, let's start with a hands-on approach and test some numbers manually, because my first instinct is that there might be a small solution set given the range 1 to 100.\n\n**Let's translate the conditions:**\n\n- \\(x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}\\)\n- \\(x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\)\n- \\(x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}\\)\n\nI\u2019ll start with the smallest mod condition that affects the largest set of numbers, which coincidentally, are 3 and 5, since they both have the remainder of 1. First, let's combine those two conditions:\n\nIf a number gives remainder 1 when divided by both 3 and 5, we can say:\n- \\(x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{15}\\) (because the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5 is 15).\n\n**Checking the compatibility of mod conditions:**\n\nNow, let\u2019s use the condition that the number must also leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4. This is where it gets a bit complex but manageable.\n\nNumbers satisfying \\(x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{15}\\) within the range of 1 to 100 are: 1, 16, 31, 46, 61, 76, 91. I found these by adding 15 to the previous number until reaching the upper limit of 100.\n\n**Applying the third condition:** \n\nNow, it's crucial that we examine which of these numbers also have the property of \\(x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}\\).\n\nLet's check:\n- \\(1 \\div 4 = 0\\) remainder 1\n- \\(16 \\div 4 = 4\\) remainder 0\n- \\(31 \\div 4 = 7\\) remainder 3 \u2713\n- \\(46 \\div 4 = 11\\) remainder 2\n- \\(61 \\div 4 = 15\\) remainder 1\n- \\(76 \\div 4 = 19\\) remainder 0\n- \\(91 \\div 4 = 22\\) remainder 3 \u2713\n\nAha! We found two numbers that work with all three conditions: 31 and 91.\n\n**Double-Checking:**\n\nLet's quickly verify these:\n\nFor 31:\n- \\(31 \\div 4 = 7\\) remainder 3\n- \\(31 \\div 3 = 10\\) remainder 1\n- \\(31 \\div 5 = 6\\) remainder 1\n\nFor 91:\n- \\(91 \\div 4 = 22\\) remainder 3\n- \\(91 \\div 3 = 30\\) remainder 1\n- \\(91 \\div 5 = 18\\) remainder 1\n\nEverything checks out for both numbers. \n\n**Sum the two integers:**\n\n31 + 91 = 122\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThe method essentially aligned all modular requirements in a plausible range, so the selected approach was sound and, upon checking, supported correctness. I considered potential pitfalls like misunderstanding remainders or number ranges but didn't find any deviation. Great, everything seems aligned well, thus my sum answer is 122.",

  "ground_truth": "Let a common solution be $a$. Then we know \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 3 & \\pmod 4\\\\\na\\equiv 1 & \\pmod 3\\\\\na\\equiv 1 & \\pmod 5\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,5)=1$, $(2)$ and $(3)$ together yield $a\\equiv 1\\pmod {3\\cdot 5}$ which is the same as $a\\equiv 1\\pmod {15}$. Then there exists an integer $n$ such that $a=1+15n$. Substituting this into $(1)$ gives \\[1+15n\\equiv 3\\pmod 4\\implies n\\equiv 2\\pmod 4\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $2$. Then $n\\ge 2\\implies a=1+15n\\ge 31$. $31$ satisfies the original congruences so subtracting it from both sides of each gives \\begin{align*}\na-31\\equiv -28\\equiv 0 & \\pmod 4\\nonumber\\\\\na-31\\equiv -30\\equiv 0 & \\pmod 3\\nonumber\\\\\na-31\\equiv -30\\equiv 0 & \\pmod 5\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $a-31\\equiv 0\\pmod {3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5}$, that is, $a\\equiv 31\\pmod{60}$.\n\nNote that any solution of the above congruence also satisfies the original ones. Then the two solutions are $31$ and $60+31=91$. Thus, $31+91=\\boxed{122}$."
