    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We need to solve the equation \\(\\frac{1}{3x-1} = \\frac{2}{x+1}\\) for \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Equation**\n\nFirst, let me really look at what's going on here. We have a fraction on each side of the equation. The simplest way to solve equations like this is probably to cross-multiply because it will eliminate the fractions and potentially simplify things down to an algebraic equation. \n\nBut before I jump into that, let me think about if there are any special cases or alternative methods. For example, checking if there's a common denominator might also make manipulation easier.\n\n**Realization:** Cross-multiplying seems like a solid approach here because it directly eliminates the fractions. Let me try that first.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Cross-Multiply**\n\nTo eliminate the fractions, cross-multiply the terms:\n\n\\[ \n1 \\cdot (x + 1) = 2 \\cdot (3x - 1) \n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx + 1 = 6x - 2\n\\]\n\n**Check-In:** Looks good so far. I've got it down to a simpler algebraic equation. Now, let's solve for \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\(x\\)**\n\nRearrange the equation to get all terms involving \\(x\\) on one side:\n\n\\[\nx + 1 = 6x - 2 \n\\] \n\nSubtract \\(x\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n1 = 5x - 2\n\\]\n\nNow, add 2 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n3 = 5x\n\\]\n\n**Internal Thought:** Okay, this makes sense. The algebra seems right. Since I\u2019m seeing a linear equation, isolating \\(x\\) should give me the solution.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Isolate \\(x\\)**\n\nNow, solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 5:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** I\u2019m getting \\(x = \\frac{3}{5}\\). Let's see if this solution holds by plugging it back into the original equation.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Check the Solution**\n\nSubstitute \\(x = \\frac{3}{5}\\) back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) - 1} \\stackrel{?}{=} \\frac{2}{\\frac{3}{5} + 1}\n\\]\n\nCalculate each side:\n\nLeft Side:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{9}{5} - \\frac{5}{5}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{5}} = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\nRight Side:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{\\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{5}{5}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{8}{5}} = \\frac{2 \\times 5}{8} = \\frac{10}{8} = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:** Both sides equal \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\), so the solution \\(x = \\frac{3}{5}\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** After following through each step carefully, I'm confident that the solution \\(x = \\frac{3}{5}\\) is correct. The problem was solved effectively by cross-multiplying and then checking my work. Cross-multiplication and plugging the result back into the original equation were key steps in verifying the solution was correct.",

  "ground_truth": "Cross multiplying, we obtain $ x+1 = 2(3x-1)$. (This is the same thing as multiplying both sides by both $3x-1$ and by $x+1$.)  Then, we solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\nx+1 &= 2(3x-1)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad x+1 &= 6x-2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad-5x &= -3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad x &= \\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}.\n\\end{align*}"
