    "working_out": "First thoughts: Okay, so we have a set of digits \\(\\{1, 3, 6, 7\\}\\) and need to see how many prime numbers can be formed using two or fewer of these digits. Hmm, that means we have to look both at single-digit and two-digit numbers crafted from these, and check if they're prime. \n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - A prime number is greater than 1 and only divisible by 1 and itself.\n   - I can use single-digit numbers and two-digit numbers formed from the given set.\n   - The numbers must be composed of either one or two digits from {1, 3, 6, 7}.\n\n2. **Starting with Single-digit Numbers**:\n   - Let's dive into single-digit numbers first. The digits available are \\(\\{1, 3, 6, 7\\}\\).\n   - Check if these single digits themselves are prime. A quick memory scan: \n     - 1 is not prime.\n     - 3 is prime.\n     - 6 is not prime.\n     - 7 is prime.\n   - Conclusion: Single-digit primes are \\(3\\) and \\(7\\).\n\n3. **Exploring Two-digit Numbers**:\n   - Now, let's form two-digit numbers using these digits. We'll try permutations since it mentions arranging them.\n   - Possible two-digit combinations are: 13, 31, 16, 61, 17, 71, 36, 63, 37, 73, 67, 76.\n   - That's quite a list, let's note all the possibilities systematically.\n\n4. **Checking which Two-digit Numbers are Prime**:\n   - I'll go through these and evaluate whether each is prime:\n     - 13: Prime (only divisible by 1 and 13).\n     - 31: Prime (only divisible by 1 and 31).\n     - 16: Not prime (divisible by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16).\n     - 61: Prime (only divisible by 1 and 61).\n     - 17: Prime (only divisible by 1 and 17).\n     - 71: Prime (only divisible by 1 and 71).\n     - 36: Not prime (divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36).\n     - 63: Not prime (divisible by 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, 63).\n     - 37: Prime (only divisible by 1 and 37).\n     - 73: Prime (only divisible by 1 and 73).\n     - 67: Prime (only divisible by 1 and 67).\n     - 76: Not prime (divisible by 1, 2, 4, 19, 38, 76).\n\n5. **Reflection and Conclusion**:\n   - For single-digit numbers, \\(3\\) and \\(7\\) are prime.\n   - For two-digit numbers, we have \\(13, 31, 61, 17, 71, 37, 73,\\) and \\(67\\) as primes.\n   - Let's count the total number of primes:\n     - Single-digit primes: 2 (3 and 7).\n     - Two-digit primes: 8 (13, 31, 61, 17, 71, 37, 73, and 67).\n     - Total: \\(2 + 8 = 10\\).\n\nOh! This confirms my calculations. I found 10 primes altogether, by considering various possibilities and cross-verifying each step with whether the numbers formed were actually prime. This seems right because breaking it into single-digit and two-digit and checking methodically worked well!",

  "ground_truth": "We have two cases: the number is either 1-digit or 2-digit.  We examine each of these cases separately.\n\nCase 1: 1 digit\n\nIn this case, the only 1-digit primes are 3 and 7, for a total of 2 primes.\n\nCase 2: 2 digits\n\nWe have the following combinations of numbers: 13, 16, 17, 36, 37, 67, 76, 73, 63, 71, 61, 31.  Out of these 12 numbers, it is easier to count the composites: 16, 36, 76, and 63 for a total of 4 composites, which we subtract from the original 12 numbers to yield $12-4=8$ primes in this case.\n\nBoth cases considered, the total number of prime numbers we can create is $2 + 8 = \\boxed{10}$."
