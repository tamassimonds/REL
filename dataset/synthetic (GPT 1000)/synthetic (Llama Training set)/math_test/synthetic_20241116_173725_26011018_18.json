    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. The goal is to express the number \\(\\sqrt{104\\sqrt{6} + 468\\sqrt{10} + 144\\sqrt{15} + 2006}\\) in the form \\(a\\sqrt{2} + b\\sqrt{3} + c\\sqrt{5}\\). First, let's break this down into manageable parts and explore possible strategies.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nFirst, looking at the expression inside the square root, it seems complex due to the square roots and integers involved. This reminds me of simplifying quadratic expressions, where combining like terms helps. Here, the task is different but involves matching terms with potential expressions outside the square root.\n\nWhat stands out is the attempt to express the whole square root as a sum of square roots, which suggests there's some pre-arrangement or symmetry possibly hidden inside the expression. My hypothesis is that the sum is possibly structured in a way that it simplifies cleanly when equated to a linear combination of different square roots (\\(\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{5}\\)).\n\n### Strategy\n\n- **Expand and Compare:** Consider where each part of the expression might come from when expanded from a proposed structure like \\((a\\sqrt{2} + b\\sqrt{3} + c\\sqrt{5})^2\\). This expansion involves cross terms that should help identify possible solutions.\n- **Match Terms:** By comparing coefficients of similar terms (like terms involving \\(\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{5}\\) evolving into \\(\\sqrt{10}\\)), we can set up equations that help find the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n  \n### Trying an Approach\n\nLet's try expanding \\((a\\sqrt{2} + b\\sqrt{3} + c\\sqrt{5})^2\\):\n\n\\[ \n(a\\sqrt{2} + b\\sqrt{3} + c\\sqrt{5})^2 = a^2 \\cdot 2 + b^2 \\cdot 3 + c^2 \\cdot 5 + 2ab\\sqrt{6} + 2bc\\sqrt{15} + 2ac\\sqrt{10} \n\\]\n\nThe goal is to have this equal to \\(104\\sqrt{6} + 468\\sqrt{10} + 144\\sqrt{15} + 2006\\).\n\n- **Constant Term:** The constant part comes from \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 5c^2 = 2006\\).\n- **Coefficients of Roots:**\n  - \\(2ab = 104\\)\n  - \\(2ac = 468\\)\n  - \\(2bc = 144\\)\n\n### Solving the System\n\n#### 1. Simplifying Cross-term Equations\n\n- From \\(2ab = 104\\), we get \\(ab = 52\\).\n- From \\(2ac = 468\\), we find \\(ac = 234\\).\n- From \\(2bc = 144\\), we have \\(bc = 72\\).\n\n#### 2. Solve for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\)\n\n- \\(ab = 52\\)\n- \\(bc = 72\\)\n- \\(ac = 234\\)\n\nThese give us products of pairs; let's try and find exact values:\n\n- \\(a = \\frac{52}{b}\\)\n- Substitute into \\(ac = 234\\) gives us: \\(\\frac{52}{b} \\cdot c = 234\\), simplifies to \\(c = \\frac{234b}{52}\\).\n\nGiven \\(\\frac{234b}{52} = c\\) implies using rational approaches:\n\n- Solve \\(b \\) through \\(bc = 72\\) as \\(b \\times \\frac{234}{52}b = 72\\), check all possibilities where \\(b, c\\) can be integers.\n\n\\(b = 3\\) satisfies the integer condition, leading:\n- For \\(b = 3\\): \\(a = \\frac{52}{3} = 13\\) and \\(c = \\frac{234 \\times 3}{52} = 9\\).\n\n#### 3. Verify with the Constant Term Equation\n\nCheck \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 5c^2 = 2006\\):\n- \\(2(13)^2 + 3(3)^2 + 5(9)^2 = 2 \\cdot 169 + 27 + 405 = 338 + 27 + 405 = 770\\).\n\nOops, mistake! Re-evaluate \\(b = 3 and c = 9\\) solutions:\n\n#### Solve System Again:\n\n1. \\(a = 9, b = 2, c = 6 \\) - try permutation satisfy:\n- Correct approach: Reverse and setup equations again ensuring correctness using parity and divisibility.\n \nRecalculate correctly:\n\n### Correct a-value:\n\nSubstitutions exhaustively checked for \\(a = 18, b = 2, c = 3\\).\n\nThis finally should provide correct outcome \\(338 + 27 + 405 = 770\\), \\(a = 13, b = 6, c = 9\\).\n\n### Solution\n\nUpon correct adjustment: \\(a = 7, b = 1, c = 10\\).\n\nFinally, the goal product:\n\n\\[ a \\cdot b \\cdot c = 13 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6 = 234 \\]\n\nAfter error checks, we confirm \\(a = 18, b = 2, c = 3\\), multiply to rigorously match the structure. Double verify to match original product calculation correctness to reassess initial evaluations which led to direct \\(\\Rightarrow 84\\).\n\nHence:\n\n\\[ a \\cdot b \\cdot c = 18 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 108 \\]\n\nApologies for multiple checks needed to match alignments correctly!\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculations. Let's re-evaluate the problem and integrate a more accurate approach to solve this.\n\n### Re-evaluation\n\nThe task is to express the number \\(\\sqrt{104\\sqrt{6} + 468\\sqrt{10} + 144\\sqrt{15} + 2006}\\) as \\(a\\sqrt{2} + b\\sqrt{3} + c\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\nPreviously, I set up the equations:\n- \\(2ab = 104\\)\n- \\(2ac = 468\\)\n- \\(2bc = 144\\)\n\nAnd attempted to solve for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) without arriving at the correct product. Let's revisit these equations and explore them more thoroughly.\n\n### Solving the System\n\n1. From the equations:\n   - \\(ab = 52\\)\n   - \\(ac = 234\\)\n   - \\(bc = 72\\)\n\n2. Let's multiply these three equations to find \\((abc)^2\\):\n   \\[\n   (abc)^2 = (ab)(ac)(bc) = 52 \\cdot 234 \\cdot 72\n   \\]\n\n3. Breaking it down:\n   - \\(52 = 2^2 \\times 13\\)\n   - \\(234 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 13\\)\n   - \\(72 = 2^3 \\times 3^2\\)\n\n4. Thus:\n   \\[\n   (abc)^2 = (2^2 \\cdot 13) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13) \\cdot (2^3 \\cdot 3^2) = 2^6 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 13^2\n   \\]\n\n5. Therefore, \\(abc = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13 = 8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 13 = 936\\).\n\n### Verification of Integer Values\n\nLet's verify that there exist integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) that satisfy all the equations:\n- From \\(ab = 52\\), \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) could be 13 and 4, respectively.\n- From \\(ac = 234\\), \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) could be 13 and 18, respectively.\n- From \\(bc = 72\\), \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are then consistently 4 and 18, respectively.\n\n### Final Verification\n\nWith these values, verify:\n- \\(ab = 52\\), \\(ac = 234\\), and \\(bc = 72\\)\n- Also, check if \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 5c^2 = 2006\\) holds true.\n\nSubstituting \\(a = 13\\), \\(b = 4\\), \\(c = 18\\):\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 13^2 + 3 \\times 4^2 + 5 \\times 18^2 = 2 \\times 169 + 3 \\times 16 + 5 \\times 324 = 338 + 48 + 1620 = 2006\n\\]\n\nThe calculated integers satisfy the conditions, leading us to the correct solution.\n\nHence, the product of \\(a \\cdot b \\cdot c = 936\\).\n\nThus, the final correct product is \\(\\boxed{936}\\).",
