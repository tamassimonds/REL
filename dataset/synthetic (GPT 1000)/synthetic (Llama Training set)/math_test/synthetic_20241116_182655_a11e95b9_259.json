    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, we need to determine the probability that the product \\( ab \\) is a prime number, where \\( a \\) is chosen from \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\) and \\( b \\) is chosen from \\(\\{5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}\\). \n\n### Brainstorming\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, several thoughts come to mind:\n- A prime number has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.\n- For the product \\( ab \\) to be a prime number, one of \\( a \\) or \\( b \\) must be 1, since 1 is the only number that won't introduce additional factors when multiplied with a prime.\n  \nSo initially, this feels similar to problems dealing with constraints on creating a prime product, but let's systematically identify possibilities.\n\n### Strategy Exploration\n\n**Step 1: Consider \\( a = 1 \\).**\n- If \\( a = 1 \\), then the product \\( ab \\) will be \\( b \\).\n- Therefore, \\( b \\) must itself be a prime number.\n- Now, from the set \\(\\{5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}\\), identify which numbers are prime.\n  - Looking at this set:\n    - \\( b = 5 \\) (prime)\n    - \\( b = 6 \\) (not prime)\n    - \\( b = 7 \\) (prime)\n    - \\( b = 8 \\) (not prime)\n    - \\( b = 9 \\) (not prime)\n- So, the prime numbers when \\( a = 1 \\) are \\( 5 \\) and \\( 7 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Consider \\( a = 2, 3, 4 \\).**\n- If \\( a \\) is any of these numbers, \\( ab \\) will not be prime because:\n  - If \\( a = 2\\), \\((a = 2) \\times b\\) is even and greater than 2, thus not prime.\n  - If \\( a = 3\\), the only possible value of \\( b \\) can make it a prime number is \\( b = 1 \\), but that\u2019s not in the set.\n  - If \\( a = 4\\), similar logic follows as \\(a = 2\\).\n\n### Reflection \n\nAs I reflect on these possibilities:\n- Only \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 5, 7 \\) give us prime numbers. \n- Any combination with \\( a = 2, 3, 4 \\) gives non-prime numbers when multiplied by any number from the set for \\( b \\).\n  \n### Check Calculation\n\nLet's perform a quick check by verifying:\n- Total possible outcomes: \\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\) outcomes.\n- Successful outcomes (from step 1) for \\( ab \\) to be prime:\n  - \\( (1, 5) \\) and \\( (1, 7) \\) which are 2 outcomes.\n\n### Probability Calculation\n\nFinally, the probability that \\( ab \\) is a prime number is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{2}{20} = \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMy understanding is consistent: the probability that the product \\( ab \\) is a prime number is \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\). Everything checks out logically, and we have accounted for all possibilities. This solution feels robust and methodically correct.",

  "ground_truth": "The product $ab$ is prime only when either $a$ or $b$ is one. Since $b$ cannot equal 1, $a$ must equal 1, and this occurs with probability $\\frac14$. Furthermore, $b$ must be prime, so $b$ must equal 5 or 7, and this occurs with probability $\\frac25$. Therefore, the probability that $ab$ is prime is $\\frac14\\cdot \\frac25 = \\boxed{\\frac1{10}}$."
