    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving the problem step by step!\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks us to solve the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + 5x + 8 = 0\\) and express the solutions in the form \\(x = a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real numbers. Then, it wants \\(a + b^2\\). Initially, this reminds me of the quadratic formula, as I recognize that this is a standard quadratic equation that can't be factored easily with integers.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Thoughts and Approach**\n\nGiven that we're dealing with a quadratic equation, the quadratic formula is the standard tool:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\nFor our equation \\(a = 1, b = 5, c = 8\\). My first thought is to plug these values into the quadratic formula to find the solutions.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Discriminant**\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\):\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = 5^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 8 = 25 - 32 = -7 \\]\n\nHmm, the discriminant is negative, which means the solutions will be complex numbers, which checks out since we're looking to express the solutions as \\(a + bi\\).\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Quadratic Formula**\n\nNow apply the formula:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{-7}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{-5 \\pm i\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\]\n\nOkay, at this stage, I recognize the solutions can be written as:\n\\[ x = -\\frac{5}{2} \\pm \\frac{i\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\]\n\nThese solutions take the forms:\n\\[ x_1 = -\\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{i\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\]\n\\[ x_2 = -\\frac{5}{2} - \\frac{i\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\]\n\nBoth solutions have the form \\(a + bi\\), where \\( a = -\\frac{5}{2} \\) and \\( b = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\).\n\nI'm satisfied with this as it aligns with my expectation because these values are consistent with what we'd expect when using the quadratic formula on a negative discriminant.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate \\(a + b^2\\)**\n\nI need to compute \\(a + b^2\\) for one of the solutions (both will yield the same value since \\(b^2\\) doesn't depend on the sign of \\(b\\)).\n\nWe'll take \\(x_1 = -\\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{i\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\) as representative (or \\(x_2\\) would yield the same value):\n\\[ a = -\\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\\[ b = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\]\n\\[ b^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{7}{4} \\]\n\nNow compute \\(a + b^2\\):\n\\[ a + b^2 = -\\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{7}{4} \\]\n\nTo add these, adjust to a common denominator:\n\\[ -\\frac{5}{2} = -\\frac{10}{4} \\]\n\nThus,\n\\[ a + b^2 = -\\frac{10}{4} + \\frac{7}{4} = -\\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter checking each step carefully, I\u2019m confident in the calculations. The value of \\( a + b^2 \\) is \\( -\\frac{3}{4} \\). All the calculations align with the initial setup, and interpreting the solutions as complex numbers checks out correctly.",

  "ground_truth": "Seeing that factoring will not work, we apply the Quadratic Formula: \\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{-(5) \\pm \\sqrt{(5)^2 - 4(1)(8)}}{2 (1)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 32}}{2} = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{-7}}{2} = -\\frac{5}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2}i.\n\\end{align*} Now we see that $a = -\\dfrac{5}{2}$ and $b = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2},$ so $a + b^2 = -\\dfrac{5}{2} + \\dfrac{7}{4} = \\boxed{-\\dfrac{3}{4}}.$"
