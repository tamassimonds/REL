    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving the problem step by step, allowing my thought process to flow naturally and checking my approach as I go.\n\n### Understanding the Question\n\nWe're given two functions: \\( f(x) = 5x + 2 \\) and \\( g(x) = 3x^2 - 4x \\).\n\nThe task is to evaluate the expression \\( f(f(1)) - g(g(2)) \\).\n\nThis looks like a problem involving function composition and evaluation.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nOkay, I know that I need to evaluate these functions at specific values and apply some operations. The question seems straightforward \u2013 evaluate \\( f \\) twice at some point and \\( g \\) twice at another - and then subtract the results. \n\n### Brainstorming Strategy\n\n1. **Evaluate \\( f(1) \\) because we need to find \\( f(f(1)) \\).**\n2. **Evaluate \\( f \\) at the result of \\( f(1) \\) to find \\( f(f(1)) \\).**\n3. **Compute \\( g(2) \\) then evaluate \\( g \\) at this result to find \\( g(g(2)) \\).**\n4. **Finally, subtract the value of \\( g(g(2)) \\) from \\( f(f(1)) \\).**\n\nSeems like a plan! Start with evaluating \\( f(1) \\).\n\n### Evaluating \\( f(f(1)) \\)\n\n1. **Calculate \\( f(1) \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   f(x) = 5x + 2\n   \\]\n\n   Substitute \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   f(1) = 5 \\cdot 1 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7\n   \\]\n\n   **Check:** This number seems reasonable, considering the multiplication and addition involved.\n\n2. **Now, find \\( f(f(1)) = f(7) \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   f(7) = 5 \\cdot 7 + 2 = 35 + 2 = 37\n   \\]\n\n   **Double-check:** Let\u2019s reflect if this makes sense considering the values we've used. Looks good to me.\n\n### Evaluating \\( g(g(2)) \\)\n\n1. **Calculate \\( g(2) \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   g(x) = 3x^2 - 4x\n   \\]\n\n   Substitute \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   g(2) = 3 \\cdot 2^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 = 3 \\cdot 4 - 8 = 12 - 8 = 4\n   \\]\n\n   **Reflect:** Each operation checks out, so \\( g(2) = 4 \\) seems correct.\n\n2. **Now, find \\( g(g(2)) = g(4) \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   g(4) = 3 \\cdot 4^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 = 3 \\cdot 16 - 16 = 48 - 16 = 32\n   \\]\n\n   **Check reflection:** The computation follows logically, so \\( g(4) = 32 \\) should be right.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n\\[\nf(f(1)) - g(g(2)) = 37 - 32\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 5\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Everything seems consistent and computed correctly. The solution matches each step I\u2019ve taken logically, clarifying the approach and confirming my result is correct. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "We have $f(1) = 5(1) + 2 = 7$, so $f(f(1)) = f(7) = 5(7) + 2 = 37$.  We have $g(2) = 3(2)^2 - 4(2) = 3(4) - 8 = 4$, so $g(g(2)) = g(4) = 3(4)^2 -4(4) = 3(16) - 16 = 32$.  Combining these, we have $f(f(1)) - g(g(2)) = 37-32 = \\boxed{5}$."
