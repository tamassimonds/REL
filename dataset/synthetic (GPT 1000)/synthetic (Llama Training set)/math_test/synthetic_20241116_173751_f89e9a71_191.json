    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with a clear and methodical approach. I\u2019ll jot down my initial thoughts and then proceed step by step.\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have two random numbers, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), each independently chosen between 0 and 1. Their sum is \\( c = a + b \\).\n   - We define \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) as the nearest integers to \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) respectively.\n   - We need to find the probability that the equation \\( A + B = C \\) holds.\n\n2. **What They Round To:**\n   - \\( a \\) rounds to 0 if \\( 0 \\le a < 0.5 \\) and to 1 if \\( 0.5 \\le a \\le 1 \\).\n   - \\( b \\) rounds to 0 if \\( 0 \\le b < 0.5 \\) and to 1 if \\( 0.5 \\le b \\le 1 \\).\n   - \\( c = a + b \\) can vary from 0 to 2, thereby:\n     - Rounds to 0 if \\( 0 \\le c < 0.5 \\)\n     - Rounds to 1 if \\( 0.5 \\le c < 1.5 \\)\n     - Rounds to 2 if \\( 1.5 \\le c \\le 2 \\)\n\nLet's consider several sub-cases based on values of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):\n\n**Case Analysis:**\n\n- **Case 1:** \\( A = 0, B = 0 \\)\n  - This occurs if \\( 0 \\le a < 0.5 \\) and \\( 0 \\le b < 0.5 \\)\n  - Then, \\( c = a + b < 1 \\)\n  - \\( C \\) will be 0 if \\( 0 \\le c < 0.5 \\) and 1 if \\( 0.5 \\le c < 1 \\)\n  - Hence, \\( A + B = C \\) if \\( C = 0 \\). This occurs if\n    - \\( 0 \\le a + b < 0.5 \\).\n  - At this stage, I need to visualize this condition on the unit square [0, 1] x [0, 1]. The area under the line \\( a + b = 0.5 \\) gives a triangle with vertices (0, 0), (0.5, 0), (0, 0.5).\n  - This triangle\u2019s area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n- **Case 2:** \\( A = 1, B = 0 \\)\n  - Occurs if \\( 0.5 \\le a \\le 1 \\) and \\( 0 \\le b < 0.5 \\)\n  - Then, \\( 0.5 \\le a + b < 1.5 \\), rounded \\( C = 1 \\)\n  - Hence, \\( A + B = C \\) if \\( C = 1 \\). This always occurs as long as \\( c < 1.5 \\).\n  - The rectangular area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n- **Case 3:** \\( A = 0, B = 1 \\)\n  - Similar to Case 2, swapping \\( a \\) with \\( b \\):\n  - \\( 0 \\le a < 0.5 \\) and \\( 0.5 \\le b \\le 1 \\)\n  - Again, \\( A+B = C \\) results in area \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n- **Case 4:** \\( A = 1, B = 1 \\)\n  - Occurs if \\( 0.5 \\le a \\le 1 \\) and \\( 0.5 \\le b \\le 1 \\)\n  - So, \\( 1 \\le a + b \\le 2 \\)\n  - \\( C \\) will be 2 if \\( 1.5 \\le c \\le 2 \\)\n  - Hence, \\( A + B = C \\) occurs if \\( 1.5 \\le a + b \\le 2 \\)\n  - This is another triangular area with vertices (1, 0.5), (0.5, 1), (1, 1).\n  - Area is again \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe successful areas for \\( A + B = C \\) in each valid scenario are each triangular regions described above.\n\nThus, the total probability is the sum of these successful region areas:\n\\[ P(A + B = C) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1 \\]\n\nThis aligns with intuition and seems consistent with geometric insights derived from the unit square approach. Hence, the probability that \\( A + B = C \\) is indeed \\( 1 \\).\n\nGreat, the deductive reasoning using geometric visualization confirms this result. If more discrepancies arise, the fault might lie in incorrect overlap consideration, but all appears aligned. Every step reveals expected symmetrical conditions\u2014each pair leading to naturally satisfying \\( A + B = C\\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculation. Let's go through the solution again and integrate the corrected approach.\n\n### Revisiting the Problem\n\nWe have:\n\n- Two random numbers, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), each independently chosen between 0 and 1.\n- Let \\( c = a + b \\).\n- \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) are the nearest integers to \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) respectively.\n- We aim to find the probability that \\( A + B = C \\).\n\nPreviously, I concluded with an incorrect probability of 1. Let's analyze this with a more precise breakdown.\n\n### Re-evaluating Conditions\n\n**Consider the rounding and outcomes:**\n\n1. **Case 1:** \\( a + b < 0.5 \\)\n   - \\( A = 0 \\), \\( B = 0 \\), and \\( C = 0 \\).\n   - The triangle with vertices (0, 0), (0.5, 0), (0, 0.5) forms this area.\n   - Area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n2. **Case 2:** \\( a \\geq 0.5 \\) and \\( b < 0.5 \\)\n   - \\( A = 1 \\), \\( B = 0 \\), and \\( C = 1 \\).\n   - This rectangle lies between (0.5, 0), (1, 0), (1, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5).\n   - Area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n3. **Case 3:** \\( a < 0.5 \\) and \\( b \\geq 0.5 \\)\n   - \\( A = 0 \\), \\( B = 1 \\), and \\( C = 1 \\).\n   - Similar area and reasoning as Case 2: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n4. **Case 4:** \\( a + b \\geq 1.5 \\)\n   - \\( A = 1 \\), \\( B = 1 \\), and \\( C = 2 \\).\n   - Forms a triangle with vertices (0.5, 1), (1, 0.5), (1, 1).\n   - Area is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n### Calculating the Correct Probability\n\n- **Total Probability:** Sum the successful region areas.\n  \\[\n  P(A + B = C) = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} \n  \\]\n  - Convert to common denominator: \n  \\[\n  = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}\n  \\]\n\nThus, the correct probability that \\( A + B = C \\) is indeed \\( \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}} \\).\n\n### Reflection\n\nThrough re-evaluation, I found that considering overlapping or exclusive regions of the unit square is crucial. The initial oversight was attributing equal areas or misinterpreting the region overlap. Now, with each case carefully recalculated, the correct result aligns with expected geometrical understanding \u2014 particularly visualizing these regions clearly.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculation. Let's reassess the solution by approaching the problem with fresh eyes and integrating a more thorough analysis.\n\n### Revisiting the Problem\n\nWe have two random numbers, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), independently selected from the interval \\([0, 1]\\). Their sum is \\( c = a + b \\). The integers \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) are the nearest integers to \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) respectively. We aim to find the probability that \\( A + B = C \\).\n\n### Brainstorming and Strategy\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and how they determine \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\):\n\n1. **Rounding Rules:**\n   - \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) both round to 0 if they are between 0 and 0.5, and round to 1 if they are between 0.5 and 1.\n   - The sum \\( c = a + b \\) rounds to 0 if \\( 0 \\le c < 0.5 \\), to 1 if \\( 0.5 \\le c < 1.5 \\), and to 2 if \\( 1.5 \\le c \\le 2 \\).\n\n2. **Evaluate Possible Cases:**\n   - **Case 1:** \\( A = 0, B = 0 \\)\n     - Occurs if \\( 0 \\le a < 0.5 \\) and \\( 0 \\le b < 0.5 \\)\n     - \\( c = a + b < 1 \\). For \\( A + B = C = 0\\), \\( c\\) should be less than 0.5.\n     - The area is a triangle with vertices at (0, 0), (0.5, 0), and (0, 0.5), with an area of \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\n   - **Case 2:** \\( A = 1, B = 0 \\)\n     - Occurs if \\( 0.5 \\le a \\le 1 \\) and \\( 0 \\le b < 0.5 \\)\n     - Here, \\( C = 1 \\)\n     - The area is a rectangle with an area of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n   - **Case 3:** \\( A = 0, B = 1 \\)\n     - Similar to Case 2 but swapped roles for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n     - Area is also \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n   - **Case 4:** \\( A = 1, B = 1 \\)\n     - Occurs if \\( 0.5 \\le a \\le 1 \\) and \\( 0.5 \\le b \\le 1 \\)\n     - Here, \\( c = a + b \\geq 1.5 \\), leading to \\( C = 2 \\)\n     - Forms another triangular area with vertices at (0.5, 1), (1, 0.5), and (1, 1), with an area of \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\).\n\n### Summary of Areas and Probability\n\nThe successful areas for \\( A + B = C \\) in each case are:\n\\[ \nP(A + B = C) = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} \n\\]\nConverting to a common denominator:\n\\[ \n= \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter revisiting and correctly calculating the areas of the regions that satisfy \\( A + B = C \\), we find that the probability is indeed \\(\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}\\). This consistent with the geometric visualization and reasoning. This method of checking and re-evaluating confirms the validity of our approach and solution.",
