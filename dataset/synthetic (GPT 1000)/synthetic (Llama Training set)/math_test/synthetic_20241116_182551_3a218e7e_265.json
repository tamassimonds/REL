    "working_out": "Okay, let's dig into this problem of finding the sum of all the odd divisors of \\(6300\\). \n\n### Initial Thoughts and Exploration\n\nWhen I first see this problem, the phrase \"odd divisors\" stands out. So, maybe I need to focus on some type of condition or property related to odd numbers. Odd numbers are integers not divisible by 2, so that seems important.\n\nThe number \\(6300\\) itself feels really large. There could be lots of divisors, and I don\u2019t fancy doing tons of calculations without some guiding principle. I might need to break down 6300 into something more manageable.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**: First thing that comes to mind is breaking down 6300 into its prime factors. This might help me quickly identify which of those factors are odd. Prime factorization usually helps with divisor problems.\n\n2. **Divisor Formula**: Another approach is using the fact that the sum of divisors can be calculated if we know its prime factorization. Hmm, I think finding the sum of divisors usually involves both even and odd ones, but perhaps there\u2019s a twist I can use here.\n\n3. **Direct Testing**: Identify all divisors directly and sum them, although this seems impractical until 6300 is simplified a bit.\n\n### Deciding on a Plan\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards starting with the **prime factorization** because it should neatly reveal the structure of the number. Once I have that, I might be able to directly see the odd divisors.\n\n### Factorizing 6300\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Divide by 2** (it\u2019s clearly even):\n   \\[\n   6300 \\div 2 = 3150\n   \\]\n   Keep going with 2:\n   \\[\n   3150 \\div 2 = 1575\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Now try 3** (sum of 1575's digits is a multiple of 3):\n   \\[\n   1575 \\div 3 = 525\n   \\]\n   Again:\n   \\[\n   525 \\div 3 = 175\n   \\]\n\n3. **Now try 5** (it ends in 5):\n   \\[\n   175 \\div 5 = 35\n   \\]\n   One more time:\n   \\[\n   35 \\div 5 = 7\n   \\]\n\n7 is prime so it remains as is. \n\nSo the factorization is:\n\\[\n6300 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^1\n\\]\n\n### Identifying Odd Divisors\n\nFrom the factorization, odd divisors must come from:\n\\[ 3^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^1 = 315 \\]\n\n### Calculate the Sum of Odd Divisors\n\nThe product \\(3^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7\\) gives a structure for odd numbers. Now use the sum formula for odd divisors:\n\nEach odd number can have a form where we choose any power of 3, 5, or 7:\n\\[ (3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2)(5^0 + 5^1 + 5^2)(7^0 + 7^1) \\]\n\nThese sums all contribute:\n\\[\n(1 + 3 + 9)(1 + 5 + 25)(1 + 7)\n\\]\n\nCalculate:\n1. \\((1 + 3 + 9) = 13\\)\n2. \\((1 + 5 + 25) = 31\\)\n3. \\((1 + 7) = 8\\)\n\nTherefore:\n\\[ 13 \\times 31 \\times 8 \\]\n\nNow, compute this product:\n\n1. \\(13 \\times 31 = 403\\)\n2. \\(403 \\times 8 = 3224\\)\n\n### Conclusion and Checks\n\nThe sum of all odd divisors of 6300 is \\(3224\\).\n\n- I checked my factorization and all sums individually, and these seem correct.\n- My break-up into odd divisors aligns properly with the original factorization.\n\nThis feels right, and I\u2019m not seeing any stray calculations that suggest otherwise. It makes sense given how the divisor sums pan out in the end. If needed, recheck any multiplications, but this does match expectations from the calculations.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we find the prime factorization of $6300$ to be $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. Note that the odd divisors of 6300 are precisely the integers of the form $3^a5^b7^c$ where $0\\leq a \\leq 2$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$. Note also that distributing $(1+3+9)(1+5+25)(1+7)$ yields 18 terms, with each integer of the form $3^a5^b7^c$ (again, where $0\\leq a \\leq 2$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$) appearing exactly once.  It follows that the sum of the odd divisors of 6300 is $(1+3+9)(1+5+25)(1+7)=\\boxed{3224}$."
