    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem. We're given an equation of a circle and asked to find its radius. The equation is:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 6y - 36 = 0. \\]\n\n### First Impressions and Thoughts\n\nThis looks like a standard circle equation problem. My initial thought is that this will probably involve rearranging the equation to get it into the standard form of a circle, which is \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\). \n\nThis reminds me of completing the square problems I've done before. Let's start by trying to transform this equation into the standard circle form.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Reorganize the terms:**\n\n   The equation is \\(x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 6y - 36 = 0\\). To complete the square, we should first move the constant to the other side:\n\n   \\[ x^2 - 4x + y^2 - 6y = 36. \\]\n\n2. **Completing the square for \\(x\\):**\n\n   We have \\(x^2 - 4x\\). To complete the square, let's think about the formula: \\((x - a)^2 = x^2 - 2ax + a^2\\). So, here:\n\n   \\[-4 = -2a \\Rightarrow a = 2.\\]\n\n   Then, \\(a^2 = 4\\). So we rewrite:\n\n   \\[ x^2 - 4x = (x-2)^2 - 4. \\]\n\n   So far so good. Now we just added and subtracted 4 to help with squaring. Let's do the same with \\(y\\).\n\n3. **Completing the square for \\(y\\):**\n\n   Now for \\(y^2 - 6y\\):\n\n   \\[-6 = -2b \\Rightarrow b = 3.\\]\n\n   Thus, \\(b^2 = 9.\\) Rewrite:\n\n   \\[ y^2 - 6y = (y-3)^2 - 9. \\]\n\n4. **Rewrite the whole equation:**\n\n   With both squares completed, plug these back into the equation:\n\n   \\[ (x-2)^2 - 4 + (y-3)^2 - 9 = 36. \\]\n\n   Simplify:\n\n   \\[ (x-2)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 36 + 4 + 9. \\]\n\n   \\[ (x-2)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 49. \\]\n\n5. **Identify the radius:**\n\n   Now our equation is in standard form \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\). Here, \\(r^2 = 49\\), so \\(r = \\sqrt{49} = 7\\).\n\n### Reflection and Verification\n\nSo the radius of the circle is 7. Let's quickly reflect on the solution:\n\n- Did I complete the square correctly for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)? Yes, I rewrote each as a perfect square effectively.\n- Did I do the arithmetic when moving constants? Yes, combining all constants to get 49 was logical.\n- Does the final form match what I expect for a circle equation? Yes, \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\) is standard.\n\nEverything checks out based on my understanding and process. Feels right! \n\nThe radius of the circle is definitely 7.",

  "ground_truth": "Completing the square gives us $(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 - 49 = 0$. Rearranging terms, we have $(x - 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 49$. It follows that the square of the radius is 49, so the radius must be $\\boxed{7}$."
