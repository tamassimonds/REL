    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem: Compute \\(\\cos 315^\\circ\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Immediately, I recognize that \\(315^\\circ\\) is an angle in the fourth quadrant of the unit circle. \n- Knowing how the cosine function behaves in different quadrants will be crucial here because cosine values are positive in the fourth quadrant. \n- This problem also reminds me of the fact that angles can be rewritten or interpreted in terms of their reference angles, which are typically easier to work with.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Reference Angle Strategy:**\n   - My first approach is to determine the reference angle for \\(315^\\circ\\). The reference angle, in general, is the acute angle that a given angle makes with the x-axis.\n   - For angles in the fourth quadrant like \\(315^\\circ\\), the reference angle can be calculated as \\(360^\\circ - 315^\\circ = 45^\\circ\\).\n   - That's convenient! I know \\(\\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\n2. **Direct Quadrantal Cosine Value Check:**\n   - Before calculating anything further, let me think about whether I can determine this based on known cosine values at key angles. Cosine is positive in the fourth quadrant, and I need to check if \\(\\cos 315^\\circ\\) is one I already know.\n   - Yup, we are indeed using a known angle. At this stage, I should be confident that I can just use cosine's symmetry and periodic properties.\n\n**Implementation of the Chosen Method:**\n\n- Based on the reference angle method, we've found the reference angle is \\(45^\\circ\\).\n- To verify, since \\(315^\\circ\\) is in the fourth quadrant where cosine is positive, using the reference angle \\(45^\\circ\\), I'll have:\n  \\[\n  \\cos 315^\\circ = \\cos(360^\\circ - 45^\\circ) = \\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**Check my Work:**\n\n- The math checks out, but let's think again a bit about what I've done:\n  - The reference angle of \\(315^\\circ\\) is definitely \\(45^\\circ\\), given it's \\(360^\\circ - 315^\\circ\\), and cosine is positive in the fourth quadrant.\n  - \\(\\cos 45^\\circ\\) being \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) is correct and standard information.\n- Let me visualize the unit circle: This angle, \\(\\cos 315^\\circ\\), is straightforward as it's reflective of \\(\\cos 45^\\circ\\), only on the positive x-axis side.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- Perfect! Everything aligns with what I know about trigonometry and the behavior of the cosine function.\n- If I had stumbled upon a negative result, I'd have been off-track since cosine should be positive in this quadrant.\n- I didn\u2019t need any alternative strategies like using trigonometric identities here because the reference angle method was direct and straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the solution highlighted is accurate, adhering to all properties of the unit circle and quadrantal behavior: \n\\[\n\\cos 315^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\]",
