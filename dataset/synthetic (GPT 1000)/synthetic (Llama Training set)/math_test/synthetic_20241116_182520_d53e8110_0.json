    "working_out": "Okay, let's take this problem one step at a time. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, so Mary wants to visit 3 out of 5 tourist locations. This sounds like a classic problem about combinations because the order in which she visits those locations doesn't matter. It's not like she's creating an itinerary where sequence counts; she's just picking places. I remember something from probability about this. There's a formula for calculating combinations where you want to choose a smaller number of items from a larger set.\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Basic Counting Strategy:** My first thought is simply to list out all possible groups of 3 locations and count them. There are 5 locations, so potential groupings might look like this: ABC, ABD, ABE, etc. But that's getting tedious already just thinking about it \u2013 counting by hand might be error-prone or slow. Plus, there must be a more efficient way. \n\n2. **Using Combinatorial Formula:** This reminds me of combinations. The combination formula is \\(\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\\) where \\(n\\) is the total number of items to choose from, and \\(r\\) is the number of items to choose. Here, \\(n = 5\\) and \\(r = 3\\).\n\n**Let's Try the Formula Approach:**\n\n- Calculate \\(5!\\): Wait, \\(5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\\).\n- Calculate \\(3!\\): Which is \\(3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\\).\n- Calculate \\((5-3)!\\): Which is \\(2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\).\n\nPlug these into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3! \\times (5-3)!} = \\frac{120}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10\n\\]\n\nOkay, so there are 10 ways for Mary to choose 3 locations out of 5.\n\n**Checking Work:**\n\n- **Quick Check on Numbers:** The result, 10, seems reasonable to me because it's not excessively large or small. That\u2019s a good sign.\n- **Reflect on the Approach:** The formula for combinations is something I've used in similar situations before, like choosing teams or groups. It feels correct.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nGreat, I used a well-established formula, and everything checks out. I initially thought about listing them all, which verified the need for a more efficient approach. The mathematical way is quicker and eliminates human error in counting or double-counting any group. \n\nSo, in conclusion, Mary can choose 3 tourist locations out of 5 in 10 different ways. This makes sense and aligns with what I remember about combinations!",
