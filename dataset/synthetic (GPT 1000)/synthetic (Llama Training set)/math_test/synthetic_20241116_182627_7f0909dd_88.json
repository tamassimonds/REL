    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem and break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nI'm asked to find the minimum value of the expression \\(x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 4y + 8\\). This is a quadratic expression involving two variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). My initial thought is this kind of expression is often minimized by completing the square, which can help reveal its minimum value more directly.\n\n### Step 2: Completing the Square\nLet's approach this by completing the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms. \n\n#### Completing the Square for the \\(x\\) Terms:\nThe terms involving \\(x\\) are \\(x^2 + 2x\\).\n\n1. **Identify perfect square:** To complete the square, I add and subtract \\((\\frac{2}{2})^2 = 1\\).\n   - \\(x^2 + 2x = (x^2 + 2x + 1) - 1 = (x + 1)^2 - 1\\)\n\n#### Completing the Square for the \\(y\\) Terms:\nThe terms involving \\(y\\) are \\(y^2 - 4y\\).\n\n2. **Identify perfect square:** To complete the square, I add and subtract \\((\\frac{-4}{2})^2 = 4\\).\n   - \\(y^2 - 4y = (y^2 - 4y + 4) - 4 = (y - 2)^2 - 4\\)\n\n### Step 3: Rewrite the Expression\nReplace the original terms with the completed square form:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + 2x - 4y + 8 = (x + 1)^2 - 1 + (y - 2)^2 - 4 + 8\n\\]\n\nSimplify this:\n\n\\[\n= (x + 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the Minimum Value\nThe expression \\((x + 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2\\) represents the sum of squares, which is minimal when both squares are zero. This happens when \\(x + 1 = 0\\) and \\(y - 2 = 0\\).\n\n1. **Solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):**\n   - \\(x + 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -1\\)\n   - \\(y - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow y = 2\\)\n\nWhen \\(x = -1\\) and \\(y = 2\\), the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(x + 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + 3 = 0^2 + 0^2 + 3 = 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Check the Work\nThis approach seems correct as all steps adhere to the mathematical process of completing the square. Ensuring these calculated points minimize each squared term to zero confirms we\u2019ve found the minimum value of the expression.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nThe minimum value of the expression \\(x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 4y + 8\\) is \\(3\\), and it occurs at \\(x = -1\\) and \\(y = 2\\).\n\nReflecting on the steps, they seem robust. Implementing the strategy of completing the square allows for a neat completion of all calculations, verifying the expression has indeed been minimized correctly.",

  "ground_truth": "Rearranging the expression, we have  \\[x^2+2x+y^2-4y+8\\]Completing the square in $x$, we need to add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$. Completing the square in $y$, we need to add and subtract $(4/2)^2=4$. Thus, we have \\[(x^2+2x+1)-1+(y^2-4y+4)-4+8 \\Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y-2)^2+3\\]Since the minimum value of $(x+1)^2$ and $(y-2)^2$ is $0$ (perfect squares can never be negative), the minimum value of the entire expression is $\\boxed{3}$, and is achieved when $x=-1$ and $y=2$."
