I'll walk through this step by step, giving you my thoughts and calculations along the way.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWhen converting a number from base 4 to base 10, the process involves breaking down the base 4 number into its individual digits and then expressing these digits as powers of 4. Each digit is multiplied by 4 raised to the power of its position (counted from right to left, starting at 0). This is similar to how we naturally understand base 10 numbers, but now with base 4.\n\n### Step 2: Breaking Down the Number\nThe base 4 number we have is \\(1230_4\\). It has four digits: \n\n- The rightmost digit is '0'.\n- The next digit is '3'.\n- The next is '2'.\n- The leftmost (and highest place) digit is '1'.\n\n### Step 3: Express Each Digit as a Power of 4\nThinking through this: each digit needs to be multiplied by 4 raised to its position power:\n- The rightmost '0' is in the \\(4^0\\) position.\n- The next '3' is in the \\(4^1\\) position.\n- The '2' is in the \\(4^2\\) position.\n- The leftmost '1' is in the \\(4^3\\) position.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating Individual Contributions\nNow I need to compute each term:\n- The contribution of the '0' in \\(4^0\\) position is \\(0 \\times 4^0 = 0\\).\n- The contribution of the '3' in \\(4^1\\) position is \\(3 \\times 4^1 = 3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n- The contribution of the '2' in \\(4^2\\) position is \\(2 \\times 4^2 = 2 \\times 16 = 32\\).\n- The contribution of the '1' in \\(4^3\\) position is \\(1 \\times 4^3 = 1 \\times 64 = 64\\).\n\n### Step 5: Adding it All Up\nNow, it's time to add up each of these contributions to find the base 10 equivalent:\n\\[ 64 + 32 + 12 + 0 = 108 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Checking the Work\nReflecting on the operations I've done:\n- Each digit was multiplied correctly by the power of 4 associated with its position.\n- The additions are straightforward, and I've double-checked them to ensure they add up correctly.\n\nEverything seems right, and there's no errors in calculations. I find the final base 10 equivalent of \\(1230_4\\) is indeed **108**.\n\n### Final Note\nThroughout the process, I kept in mind the positional values based on powers of 4, which is essential for base conversion. This careful attention to detail ensures that the conversion is accurate. It seems like everything lines up correctly with my understanding of the number conversion problem.\n\nSo, \\(1230_4\\) in base 10 is \\(108_{10}\\).",
