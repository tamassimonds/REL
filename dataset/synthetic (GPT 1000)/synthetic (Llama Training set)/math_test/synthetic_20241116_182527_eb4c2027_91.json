    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, we're dealing with number theory and floor functions, and my initial thought is that it involves understanding how the floor function interacts with cube roots and divisibility. Moreover, we're tasked with finding a maximum ratio. \n\nHere's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Floor Condition\nWe're given \\( k = \\lfloor \\sqrt[3]{n_i} \\rfloor \\), which means for all \\( n_i \\), the integer part of the cube root is \\( k \\). I immediately think:\n\n\\[ k \\leq \\sqrt[3]{n_i} < k + 1 \\]\n\nThis translates into bounds for \\( n_i \\) as:\n\n\\[ k^3 \\leq n_i < (k+1)^3 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Count Conditions\nThere are exactly 70 such numbers \\( n_i \\) in this range where \\( n_i \\) is also divisible by \\( k \\). This sounds tricky without inspecting a few small cases. I wonder how narrow down this range to satisfy the divisibility and counting condition seamlessly. \n\n### Step 3: Explore Little Cases and Trial\nFirst, I\u2019ll check simple numbers to build an intuition. Let's test with small \\( k \\):\n- If \\( k = 1 \\), the range is \\([1, 8)\\), including \\( 1 \\), \\( 2 \\), ..., \\( 7 \\). That's 7 numbers. Each divisible by 1, but does not reach 70. Hold this thought.\n- Increasing \\( k \\), the numbers grow rapidly with cube, impacting the counting.\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\( n_i \\) and Divisibility\nI will now more closely look into the numbers in the \\( k^3 \\) to \\((k+1)^3\\) range that are divisible by \\( k \\).\n\nDefine a critical step here:\nFor \\( n_i = qk \\) where \\( k^3 \\leq n_i < (k+1)^3 \\), converting bounds gives:\n\n\\[ k^3 \\leq qk < (k+1)^3 \\]\n\\[ k^2 \\leq q < \\frac{(k+1)^3}{k} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Count \\( q \\)\nCalculate for \\( q \\):\n- \\( q_{\\min} = k^2 \\)\n- \\( q_{\\max} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{(k+1)^3}{k} \\right\\rfloor \\) \n\nThe number of \\( q \\) is thus derived as:\n\\[ \\text{Count of } q = q_{\\max} - q_{\\min} + 1 = \\left(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{(k+1)^3}{k} \\right\\rfloor - k^2 + 1\\right) = 70 \\]\n\nI will derive from there the exact division. Move to more algebraic details:\n\n\\[ \\frac{(k+1)^3}{k} = k^2 + 3k + 3 + \\frac{1}{k} \\]\n\\[ \\therefore \\left\\lfloor k^2 + 3k + 3 + \\frac{1}{k} \\right\\rfloor - k^2 + 1 = 70 \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[ 3k + 4 = 70 \\]\n\\[ 3k = 66 \\]\n\\[ k = 22 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Maximum \\(\\frac{n_i}{k}\\)\nWith \\( k = 22 \\), \\( n_i \\) lies in the range \\([22^3, 23^3)\\).\n\nTo maximize \\(\\frac{n_i}{k}\\):\n- Upper boundary for \\( n_i \\) is \\( n_i \\approx 23^3 = 12167 \\).\n- Check \\( n_i = 22 \\times \\left\\lfloor \\frac{23^3}{22} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n  \nMaximize for \\( n_i = 22 \\times 553 = 12166 \\approx \\left\\lfloor 23^3 / 22 \\right\\rfloor \\cdot 22\\).\n\nThus:\n\\[ \\frac{12166}{22} = 553 \\]\n\nResult:\n\\[ \\boxed{553} \\]\n\nI checked the calculations thoroughly to ensure any conversion or boundary missed. Reassuring consistently follows the logical framework and computations. It seems correct.",

  "ground_truth": "Because $k \\leq \\sqrt[3]{n_i} < k+1$, it follows that $k^3 \\leq n_i\n< (k+1)^3 = k^3 +3k^2 +3k +1$. Because $k$ is a divisor of $n_i$, there are $3k+4$ possible values for $n_i$, namely $k^3, k^3 +k,\n\\ldots, k^3 +3k^2 +3k$. Hence $3k+4 = 70$ and $k =22$. The desired maximum is $\\dfrac{k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k}{k} = k^2 + 3k + 3 = \\boxed{553}$."
