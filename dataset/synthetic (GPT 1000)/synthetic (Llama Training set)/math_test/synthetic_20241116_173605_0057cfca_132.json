    "working_out": "First Thoughts:  \nOkay, we need to identify a point on the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) given that the point \\((8, 8)\\) is on another transformed graph \\( y = \\frac{1}{4} f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right) \\). This looks like it involves understanding how transformations affect coordinates from one function to another.\n\nLet's start by considering what this transformation does. \n\nUnderstanding the Transformation:  \nThe function \\( y = \\frac{1}{4} f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right) \\) involves two transformations:\n1. Inner transformation: \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right) \\) - This is a horizontal stretch. Normally, in \\( f(kx) \\), a factor \\(k<1\\) means a stretch. Hence, \\( \\frac{1}{2}x \\) indicates the graph of \\( f(x) \\) is stretched by a factor of 2 horizontally, meaning each x-coordinate on \\( y = f(x) \\) becomes twice its value in \\( y = \\frac{1}{4}f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right) \\).\n2. Outer transformation: \\( \\frac{1}{4} f(x) \\) - This is a vertical shrink by a factor of 4.\n\nBrainstorming Potential Strategies:  \n1. Utilize the given point plug-in to find consistent values and determine how they travel through these transformations.\n2. Try to reverse the process by understanding what happens to the input in \\( y = f(x) \\) after the transformations.\n3. Consider any mathematical expressions for the inverses of these transformations.\n\nApplying the Approach:  \nThe point \\((8,8)\\) on \\( y = \\frac{1}{4}f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right) \\) means:\n\n- The x-value was originally \\(2x = 8 \\Rightarrow x = 4\\) in the function \\( y = f(x) \\) before the horizontal stretch.\n- The y-value, originally \\( 8 \\) on the transformed graph, should correspond to \\(4y = 8 \\Rightarrow y = 32\\) in the function \\( y = f(x) \\) before the shrink.\n\nSummarizing the Transformations:  \nGiven \\((8, 8)\\):\n- The original x-coordinate before transformation was \\( 4 \\).\n- The original y-value before the transformation was \\( f(4) = 32 \\).\n\nTherefore, the point \\((4, 32)\\) must be on the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\).\n\nChecking for Reasonableness:  \nLet me quickly verify:\n- Horizontal stretch factor, confirmed as correct by \\( \\frac{1}{2}x \\rightarrow x = 4\\).\n- Vertical shrink factor consistent with understanding \\( f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)/4 \\rightarrow y= 8 \\rightarrow f(x) = 32 \\).\n\nFinal Calculation:  \nThe question asks for the sum of the coordinates of the required point:  \nSum = \\( 4 + 32 = 36 \\).\n\nReflecting on the Result:  \nThe logic and calculations seem consistent with the transformations explained. Therefore, the answer, 36, appears correct through this transformation reflection.",

  "ground_truth": "Given that $(8,8)$ is on the graph of $y=\\frac 14f\\left(\\frac 12x\\right)$, we can substitute $8$ for both $x$ and $y$ in that equation to obtain $$8 = \\frac14f\\left(\\frac 12\\cdot 8\\right).$$We can rewrite this information as $$32 = f(4),$$which tells us that $(4,32)$ must be on the graph of $y=f(x)$. The sum of coordinates of this point is $\\boxed{36}$."
