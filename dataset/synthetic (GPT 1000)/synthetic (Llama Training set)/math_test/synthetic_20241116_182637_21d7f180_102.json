    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see how we can tackle it step by step. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's break down the question. We have a 10-question true/false test, and we need to find the number of ways to answer it such that at least 3 of the answers are false. This immediately makes me think about counting and combinatorics. \n\n### Step 2: Brainstorming Approaches\n\n1. **Direct Counting**: First thought is to count directly how many answers have at least 3 false answers. But this might get complicated since we need to calculate for 3, 4, ..., up to 10 false answers.\n  \n2. **Complementary Counting**: Another approach could be to use the complement rule. We know there are a total of \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) possible ways to answer the test (each question can be true or false), and instead of calculating all the cases with at least 3 false answers, we could calculate the cases with 0, 1, or 2 false answers and then subtract from the total. This seems promising.\n\n3. **Recursive Thought**: Consider the recursion of building answers by question. Each question answered affects the count of false. But this seems more complex.\n\n**Reflection**: Of the brainstormed methods, complementary counting seems simpler and more direct. I think I'll start there.\n\n### Step 3: Proceeding with Complementary Counting\n\nGiven there are \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) possible sequences of answers, let's compute the cases that we don't want (0, 1, or 2 false answers).\n\n#### Case 1: 0 False Answers\n\n- This implies all answers are true.\n- There is clearly only 1 such case: TTTTTTTTTT.\n\n#### Case 2: 1 False Answer\n\n- We need to place 1 false in one of the 10 positions.\n- This is given by \\(\\binom{10}{1} = 10\\) ways.\n\n#### Case 3: 2 False Answers\n\n- We need to place 2 falses in ten positions. \n- This can be computed as \\(\\binom{10}{2}\\).\n\nLet's calculate that: \n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: These calculations seem reasonable and straightforward. We have accounted for the complements effectively.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating Using Complementary Counting\n\nNow let\u2019s find the total number of unwanted cases, where there are fewer than three false answers:\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ (0 false)} + 10 \\text{ (1 false)} + 45 \\text{ (2 false)} = 56\n\\]\n\nSubtracting from the total number of unrestricted answers (1024), we get:\n\n\\[\n1024 - 56 = 968\n\\]\n\n**Final Check**: Recapitulated every calculation step and ensured their correctness.\n\n### Encapsulating the Solution\n\nThe number of ways to answer the 10-question true/false test such that at least 3 answers are false is **968**. \n\nThis problem required parsing the requirements into a count of needed outcomes versus what was not needed, invoking combinatorics principles. Complementary counting was affirmed as an effective method after assessing possible alternate approaches.",

  "ground_truth": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ ways to answer the questions on the true/false test. However, we can also compute the number of ways of answering the questions on the true/false test by using combinations; there are $\\binom{10}{k}$ ways to answer $k$ of the questions on the test with a false, so we have: $$\\binom{10}{0} + \\binom{10}{1} + \\cdots + \\binom{10}{9} + \\binom{10}{10} = 2^{10}.$$ The desired answer is \\begin{align*}\n&\\binom{10}{3} + \\binom{10}{4} + \\cdots + \\binom{10}{9} + \\binom{10}{10} \\\\\n=\\text{ }&2^{10} - \\binom{10}{0} - \\binom{10}{1} - \\binom{10}{2} = 1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 \\\\\n=\\text{ }&\\boxed{968}.\n\\end{align*}"
