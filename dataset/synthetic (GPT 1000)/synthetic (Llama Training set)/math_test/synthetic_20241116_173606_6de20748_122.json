    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and try to simplify \\(\\frac{18!}{16!}\\). \n\n**First thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see this expression, I recall from earlier problems I've done that involving factorials usually means a lot of multiplication. Simplifying factorials often involves canceling common terms. I think that's probably the key here, because both the numerator and the denominator involve factorials, and factorial expressions often have a lot in common.\n\n**Brainstorming strategies:**\n\n1. **Factorial Breakdown:** Since factorials involve multiplying a sequence of numbers, I could try breaking down \\(18!\\) and \\(16!\\) into their individual components. This often makes it easier to see what can be canceled out. \n   \n2. **Direct Calculation:** Another approach would be directly calculating the expansions of \\(18!\\) and \\(16!\\) and then performing the division. But that seems pretty intensive due to the large numbers, so I'll hopefully avoid that if there\u2019s a simpler method.\n\n3. **Simplify by Recognition:** A third strategy might be to remember a specific pattern or rule about reducing factorials, but I don\u2019t have a clear memory of one, so instead, reducing by breaking down looks promising.\n\n**Let's start with the Factorial Breakdown Method:**\n\n1. **Break down the factorials:**\n    - \\(18!\\) means \\(18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15 \\dots \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\).\n    - \\(16!\\) means \\(16 \\times 15 \\times \\dots \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\).\n\n2. **Cancellation Insight:** \n   - Looking at this, \\(16!\\) can be seen as a product of numbers that are part of \\(18!\\). This echoes in memory that dividing these factorials might involve canceling out \\(16!\\) from both, leaving just the extra terms from \\(18\\) down to \\(17\\).\n\n3. **Simplification:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{18!}{16!} = \\frac{18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15 \\times \\ldots \\times 1}{16 \\times 15 \\times \\ldots \\times 1} = 18 \\times 17\n   \\]\n   - When dividing by \\(16!\\), all terms \\(16\\) through \\(1\\) in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out.\n\n4. **Calculate Remaining Expression:**\n   - So I now only need to calculate \\(18 \\times 17\\).\n\n5. **Perform Multiplication:**\n   \\[\n   18 \\times 17 = 306\n   \\]\n\n**Reflections and Checks:**\n\n- **Revisiting the Breakdown:** Double-checking my cancellation from the breakdown shows it\u2019s correct. The \\(16!\\) terms in the numerator exactly canceled with those in the denominator.\n  \n- **The Result:** The manual multiplication \\(18 \\times 17\\) aligns with what I calculate separately as \\(306\\).\n\n- **Revisiting Strategies:** This direct breakdown approach is correct, it successfully simplified the expression to something manageable and easy to multiply.\n\nIt seems like my initial brainstorm about simplifying by canceling common terms was spot on. I'm happy with the method and convinced the answer \\(306\\) is correct.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(306\\)\n\nThis feels correct based on my understanding and checks! If there\u2019s another simpler way, it didn't come to me in this exploration, but I\u2019m confident in the steps I took.",

  "ground_truth": "We can express $\\frac{18!}{16!}$ as $\\frac{18\\cdot17\\cdot16!}{16!}$. To simplify this expression, we can cancel $16!$ from the numerator and denominator, leaving us with $18\\cdot17$, or $\\boxed{306}$."
