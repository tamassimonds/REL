    "working_out": "Alright, let's break down the problem given to us step by step, thinking through it like I would naturally approach this.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the problem**\n\n- We have two bags of balls. \n- Bag A has 3 white and 2 red balls.\n- Bag B has 6 white and 3 red balls.\n- We are randomly choosing one of these two bags.\n- Then from the chosen bag, we are drawing two balls without replacement. \n- We need to find the probability that these two balls drawn are of the same color.\n\n**Step 2: Conceptual approach**\n\n- Since the choice of the bag is random, the first step involves recognizing this part and then looking specifically at the probabilities of drawing two balls of the same color from each specific bag.\n- We can use conditional probabilities here: find the probability for each scenario (choosing Bag A or Bag B) and then apply the law of total probability.\n\n**Step 3: Probability for each bag**\n\n- Let's first focus on Bag A.\n\n  - Bag A: 3 white, 2 red balls.\n  \n  - Probability both are white:\n    \\[\n    P(\\text{two white from Bag A}) = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{10}\n    \\]\n  \n  - Probability both are red:\n    \\[\n    P(\\text{two red from Bag A}) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{10}\n    \\]\n  \n  - Adding these for the probability of drawing two balls of the same color from Bag A:\n    \\[\n    P(\\text{both same color from Bag A}) = \\frac{3}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}\n    \\]\n\n- Now for Bag B:\n\n  - Bag B: 6 white, 3 red balls.\n  \n  - Probability both are white:\n    \\[\n    P(\\text{two white from Bag B}) = \\frac{6}{9} \\times \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{15}{36} = \\frac{5}{12}\n    \\]\n  \n  - Probability both are red:\n    \\[\n    P(\\text{two red from Bag B}) = \\frac{3}{9} \\times \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{12}\n    \\]\n  \n  - Adding these for the probability of drawing two balls of the same color from Bag B:\n    \\[\n    P(\\text{both same color from Bag B}) = \\frac{5}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2}\n    \\]\n\n**Step 4: Overall probability calculation**\n\n- The choice of the bag is random, meaning each bag has a \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) probability of being selected.\n\n- Total probability that the two balls drawn are of the same color:\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{same color}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{4}\n  \\]\n\n- To add these fractions, find a common denominator (20 in this case):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{20}, \\quad \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{5}{20}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4}{20} + \\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{9}{20}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 5: Reflection**\n\n- This answer seems reasonable given the distribution of colors in the bags and the number of same-color pair combinations.\n- I double-checked the probabilities and conversions for errors, and they all check out. \n\nSo, the probability that the two balls drawn are of the same color is \\( \\frac{9}{20} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "We need to use casework. Suppose first that bag A is chosen: there is a $1/2$ chance of this occurring. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2} = 10$ total ways to select two balls from bag A. If the two balls are the same color, then they must be either both white or both red. If both are white, then there are ${3\\choose 2} = 3$ ways to pick the two white balls, and if both are red, then there is $1$ way to pick the two red balls. Thus, the probability of selecting two balls of the same color from bag A is $\\frac{1+3}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nNext, suppose that bag B is chosen, again with $1/2$ chance. There are ${9 \\choose 2} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8}{2} = 36$ ways to pick the two balls. There are ${6 \\choose 2} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5}{2} = 15$ ways to pick two white balls, and ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ ways to pick two red balls. Thus, the probability that two balls drawn from bag B are the same color is equal to $\\frac{15+3}{36} = \\frac 12$.\n\nThus, the probability that the balls have the same color is $\\frac 12 \\cdot \\frac 25 + \\frac 12 \\cdot \\frac 12 = \\boxed{\\frac 9{20}}$."
