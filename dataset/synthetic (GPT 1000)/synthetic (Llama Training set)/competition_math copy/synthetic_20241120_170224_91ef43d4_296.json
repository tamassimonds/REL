I remember dealing with similar issues where you represent a number in different bases and find a common base-10 equivalent. \n- **Similar Problems:** It vaguely reminds me of problems where you convert base-n numbers to base-10 to find commonalities. Maybe I have to set the two representations equal to each other?\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Convert \\( AA_5 \\) and \\( BB_7 \\) to Base-10:** This seems like a straightforward approach. If I convert both numbers to base-10, I can then set them equal to find the smallest integer.\n  2. **Establish Equations Based on Base Properties:** Perhaps writing equations that represent both numbers could work.\n  3. **Check Validity of Digits \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):** I need to ensure that \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are valid digits in their respective bases (i.e., \\( A \\) must be between 0 and 4, and \\( B \\) must be between 0 and 6).\n  \n- **Uncertainty:** Wait, is there a possibility that \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) could be 0? That might affect the representation, especially since leading zeros usually don't count in base representations.\n\nHmm, I'm starting to think that converting both expressions to base-10 and then finding the smallest common integer might be the most straightforward path. But let me explore it further to ensure this is the best approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding Base Representation**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Each number has a base that determines how its digits are valued. For example, in base-5, the rightmost digit is multiplied by \\( 5^0 \\), the next by \\( 5^1 \\), and so on. The same applies to base-7.\n- **Reflection:** Okay, so \\( AA_5 \\) means both digits are \\( A \\), and \\( BB_7 \\) means both digits are \\( B \\). I need to represent these in base-10 to compare them.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Converting \\( AA_5 \\) to Base-10**\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  AA_5 = A \\times 5^1 + A \\times 5^0 = A \\times 5 + A \\times 1 = A(5 + 1) = 6A\n  \\]\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because each position's value is determined by its base raised to the power of its position.\n\nWait, so \\( AA_5 \\) converts to \\( 6A \\) in base-10. That seems straightforward. But I should check if \\( A \\) is within the valid range for base-5 digits (0 to 4).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Converting \\( BB_7 \\) to Base-10**\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  BB_7 = B \\times 7^1 + B \\times 7^0 = B \\times 7 + B \\times 1 = B(7 + 1) = 8B\n  \\]\n- **Check:** Similarly, each digit \\( B \\) is multiplied by the base-7 position values.\n\nSo, \\( BB_7 \\) converts to \\( 8B \\) in base-10. I need to make sure \\( B \\) is a valid digit in base-7 (0 to 6).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Since both representations equal the same base-10 integer, I can set up the equation:\n  \\[\n  6A = 8B\n  \\]\n- **Reflection:** This equation must hold true for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) being valid digits in their respective bases. I'll need to solve for integer solutions within the valid range of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nBut wait, both sides of the equation must be multiples of their respective coefficients, so \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) must be such that this equality holds.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**\n\n- **Calculation:** Rearranging the equation:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{A}{B} = \\frac{8}{6} = \\frac{4}{3}\n  \\]\n- **Thought Process:** This simplification tells me that \\( A \\) must be four-thirds of \\( B \\). Since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) must be integers, \\( B \\) must be a multiple of 3 for \\( A \\) to remain an integer.\n\nHmm, that might work. Let's see if we can find integer values for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) within their respective base limits.\n\n- **Possible Values:**\n  - Since \\( B \\) must be between 0 and 6 and a multiple of 3, the possible values for \\( B \\) are 0, 3, and 6.\n  - Let's consider each case:\n    1. **\\( B = 0 \\):** \n       - \\( A = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 0 = 0 \\)\n       - But wait, having both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) as 0 might not be valid because base representations can't have leading zeros. Additionally, \\( AA_5 \\) would represent 00 in base-5, which is just 0 in base-10.\n    2. **\\( B = 3 \\):**\n       - \\( A = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 3 = 4 \\)\n       - Check: \\( A = 4 \\) is valid in base-5.\n       - \\( BB_7 = 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\) in base-10.\n       - \\( AA_5 = 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\) in base-10.\n       - **Reflection:** Both representations equal 24 in base-10. This seems correct.\n    3. **\\( B = 6 \\):**\n       - \\( A = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 6 = 8 \\)\n       - But \\( A = 8 \\) isn't valid in base-5 (since base-5 digits are only 0-4). So this case is invalid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Solution**\n\n- **Thought Process:** The only valid solution within the constraints is \\( A = 4 \\) and \\( B = 3 \\), resulting in both \\( AA_5 \\) and \\( BB_7 \\) equaling 24 in base-10.\n- **Check:**\n  - **\\( AA_5 = 44_5 \\):** \n    \\[\n    4 \\times 5^1 + 4 \\times 5^0 = 20 + 4 = 24_{10}\n    \\]\n  - **\\( BB_7 = 33_7 \\):** \n    \\[\n    3 \\times 7^1 + 3 \\times 7^0 = 21 + 3 = 24_{10}\n    \\]\n- **Reflection:** Both conversions check out. The base-10 integer is indeed 24.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Completion:** By systematically converting each base representation to base-10 and setting up a proportional relationship between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), I found that the smallest base-10 integer satisfying both conditions is **24**.\n- **Considerations:**\n  - Initially considering \\( A = 0 \\) and \\( B = 0 \\) led to both numbers being 0 in base-10, which might not be the intended smallest positive integer solution.\n  - Ensuring \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) fit within their respective base constraints was crucial in narrowing down valid solutions.\n- **Reflection:** This approach seems effective as it directly links the base representations through a simple proportional relationship, leading to a quick identification of the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as \\( AA_5 \\) and \\( BB_7 \\) is **24**. By converting both representations to base-10 and solving the resulting equation, we ensured that \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) were within their valid ranges and found the correct and smallest integer solution.",
