That means we have a cone with the top cut off, leaving two parallel circular bases. The question provides the radii of both bases and the height of the truncated cone. We're asked to find the volume of this solid.\n\nWhen I first see this, I recall that the volume of a regular cone is involved, and maybe there's a way to adapt that formula for a truncated cone. But I'm not entirely sure how to proceed right off the bat. Let's explore a few strategies to see which one works best.\n\n---\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Volume Formula for Truncated Cone (Frustum of a Cone):**\n   I remember there's a specific formula for the volume of a truncated cone:\n\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi h \\left( r_1^2 + r_1 r_2 + r_2^2 \\right)\n   \\]\n   \n   where:\n   - \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) are the radii of the two bases\n   - \\( h \\) is the height\n\n   This seems straightforward, but I want to double-check if this formula is applicable here.\n\n2. **Visualize the Solid and Apply Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   Maybe I could visualize the solid and see if I can relate the dimensions using the Pythagorean theorem. This might help if I need to derive the formula myself.\n\n3. **Decompose the Solid into Simpler Shapes:**\n   Another approach could be to decompose the truncated cone into a cylinder and two frustums, but that seems more complicated than necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Checking Initial Ideas**\n\nWait a minute, the formula for the volume of a truncated cone looks familiar, and I think it's derived from the volume of a regular cone. Let me briefly recall how that works:\n\n- A regular cone's volume is based on the area of its base times its height.\n- A truncated cone is essentially removing the top part of a larger cone, so we need to consider both bases.\n\nThis makes me lean towards using the first strategy directly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Applying the Truncated Cone Volume Formula**\n\nGiven:\n- Large base radius \\( r_1 = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n- Small base radius \\( r_2 = 4 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n- Height \\( h = 6 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n\nLet's plug these values into the truncated cone volume formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (6) \\left( 8^2 + 8 \\times 4 + 4^2 \\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating inside the parentheses first:\n\n\\[\n8^2 = 64\n\\]\n\\[\n8 \\times 4 = 32\n\\]\n\\[\n4^2 = 16\n\\]\n\\[\n64 + 32 + 16 = 112\n\\]\n\nNow substituting back into the formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (6) (112)\n\\]\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (672)\n\\]\n\\[\nV = 224\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n\\]\n\nSo, the volume is **\\( 224\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\)**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Reflecting on the Strategy**\n\nHmm, let's check if this approach makes sense. The formula for the volume of a truncated cone is well-established, and I followed it correctly by substituting the given radii and height. The calculations seem straightforward, and the units are correct.\n\nI briefly consider if there's another method that might yield a different result, but decomposing the solid or visualizing it doesn't seem to offer a simpler solution here. The formula is direct and efficient for this type of problem.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Verifying the Calculation**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's do a quick check:\n\n- Recalculating the terms inside the parentheses:\n  \\[\n  64 + 32 + 16 = 112\n  \\]\n- Multiplying step-by-step:\n  \\[\n  112 \\times 6 = 672\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{672}{3} = 224\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  224 \\times \\pi = 224\\pi\n  \\]\n\nEverything checks out. The volume is indeed **\\( 224\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\)**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection**\n\nUsing the truncated cone volume formula was the most straightforward approach here. Attempting to visualize the solid or decompose it into simpler shapes would likely complicate things unnecessarily. The calculations align with the formula, and a quick verification confirms the result.\n\nSo, the final answer is **\\( 224\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\)**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, I confirmed the effectiveness of using the standard formula for the volume of a truncated cone. Checking each step ensured the calculations were accurate, leading to a confident and correct solution.",

We don't know the height of the small cone, so call it $x$.  Since the small and large cone are similar, we have $x/4=(x+6)/8$; solving yields $x=6$.  Hence the small cone has radius 4, height 6, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(4^2)(6)=32\\pi$ and the large cone has radius 8, height 12, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(8^2)(12)=256\\pi$.  The frustum's volume is the difference of these two volumes, or $256\\pi-32\\pi=\\boxed{224\\pi}$ cubic cm."
