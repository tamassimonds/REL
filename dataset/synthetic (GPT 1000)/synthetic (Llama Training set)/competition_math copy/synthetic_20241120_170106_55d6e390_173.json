    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I would approach it in real life. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, it reminds me of order of operations\u2014basic PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). However, the question specifically asks for the expression **after** removing parentheses, which makes me think about how parentheses affect the order of operations.\n\nInitial questions that pop into my mind:\n\n- **Does removing the parentheses change the outcome?**\n- **What happens to the order of operations without them?**\n- **Is there a specific strategy to evaluate this neatly?**\n\nI remember from previous problems that parentheses clarify which operations to perform first. Without them, I need to follow the standard order of operations strictly.\n\nHmm, maybe I should start by evaluating the expression **with** parentheses to see what it equals. Then, I can compare it to the expression **without** parentheses to understand the impact.\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluate the Expression with Parentheses**\n\nThe original expression with parentheses is:\n\\[ \n54 + (98 \\div 14) + (23 \\cdot 17) - 200 - (312 \\div 6) \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Does the parentheses affect the calculations?**  \n  Yes, they indicate which operations should be completed first.\n\n- **Should I perform the divisions and multiplications inside the parentheses first?**  \n  Absolutely, following PEMDAS.\n\n**Begin Calculations:**\n\n1. **First Parenthesis: \\(98 \\div 14\\)**  \n   \\[ 98 \\div 14 = 7 \\]  \n   *Reflection:* That seems right. 14 times 7 is 98.\n\n2. **Second Parenthesis: \\(23 \\cdot 17\\)**  \n   \\[ 23 \\cdot 17 = 391 \\]  \n   *Check:* I remember multiplying 23 by 10 is 230, and by 7 is 161, so 230 + 161 = 391. Seems correct.\n\n3. **Third Parenthesis: \\(312 \\div 6\\)**  \n   \\[ 312 \\div 6 = 52 \\]  \n   *Quick Check:* 6 times 52 is 312, so that works.\n\n**New Expression After Evaluating Parentheses:**\n\\[ \n54 + 7 + 391 - 200 - 52 \n\\]\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate the Expression Without Parentheses**\n\nNow, let's consider the expression without parentheses:\n\\[ \n54 + 98 \\div 14 + 23 \\cdot 17 - 200 - 312 \\div 6 \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Will removing parentheses change the order of operations?**  \n  Yes, without parentheses, I need to follow PEMDAS strictly, which means performing divisions and multiplications before additions and subtractions.\n\n- **Should I prioritize division and multiplication first?**  \n  Definitely, just like in the previous step.\n\n**Begin Calculations:**\n\n1. **Perform Divisions and Multiplications First:**\n\n   - **\\(98 \\div 14\\):**  \n     \\[ 98 \\div 14 = 7 \\]  \n     *(Already calculated earlier)*\n\n   - **\\(23 \\cdot 17\\):**  \n     \\[ 23 \\cdot 17 = 391 \\]  \n     *(Also previously calculated)*\n\n   - **\\(312 \\div 6\\):**  \n     \\[ 312 \\div 6 = 52 \\]  \n     *(Earlier calculation)*\n\n**Updating the Expression:**\n\\[ \n54 + 7 + 391 - 200 - 52 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute\u2014the expression **after** removing parentheses is exactly the same as the one **after** evaluating them. This suggests that parentheses don\u2019t change the outcome here because they've already been accounted for.\n\n### **Step 3: Finalizing the Calculation**\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression step by step.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Should I perform additions and subtractions from left to right?**  \n  Yes, following the order of operations.\n\n- **Is there anything that appears off?**  \n  No, everything seems in order.\n\n**Begin Simplifying:**\n\n1. **Additions From Left to Right:**\n\n   - **First Addition:**  \n     \\[ 54 + 7 = 61 \\]  \n     *(Quick Check: 54 plus 7 is 61, correct.)*\n\n   - **Second Addition:**  \n     \\[ 61 + 391 = 452 \\]  \n     *(Check: Adding 391 to 61 gives 452, seems correct.)*\n\n2. **Subtractions From Left to Right:**\n\n   - **First Subtraction:**  \n     \\[ 452 - 200 = 252 \\]  \n     *(Quick Check: 452 minus 200 is 252, correct.)*\n\n   - **Second Subtraction:**  \n     \\[ 252 - 52 = 200 \\]  \n     *(Check: 252 minus 52 equals 200, which aligns with the original statement.)*\n\n**Final Result:**\n\\[ \n200 \n\\]\n\n### **Step 4: Reflection and Verification**\n\n**User Query:**  \nWhat does this expression equal?\n\n**Expression After Removing Parentheses:**  \n\\[ \n54 + 98 \\div 14 + 23 \\cdot 17 - 200 - 312 \\div 6 \n\\]\n\n**Result:**  \n\\[ \n200 \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does the result align with the original statement?**  \n  Yes, both the evaluated expression and the expression without parentheses equal 200.\n\n- **Is there anything in the process that seems incorrect?**  \n  No, the order of operations was followed correctly, and the calculations check out.\n\n- **Final Thoughts:**  \n  Initially, I wondered if removing parentheses would change the outcome, but it turns out that performing operations without them followed the same order as when they were present. This consistency reassured me that the approach was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe expression equals **200**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThis problem highlighted the importance of understanding the order of operations. Even though parentheses were removed, the operations followed PEMDAS, leading to the same result. It was crucial to perform divisions and multiplications first and then proceed with additions and subtractions in order, ensuring accuracy throughout.\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies and constantly checking my work, I confirmed that the final result was indeed correct. It's a great reminder that a structured approach, combined with reflection and verification, leads to reliable outcomes in mathematical problems.",
