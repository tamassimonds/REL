    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's brainstorm and approach the problem of computing \\(\\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3^4}\\) just as I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll walk through my initial thoughts, explore different strategies, check my work regularly, and adjust my approach as needed. Writing it out naturally, including doubts and realizations, will help ensure a thorough understanding and correct solution.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n**First Thoughts:**\nAlright, we need to compute the square root of \\(2^2 \\cdot 3^4\\). At first glance, this reminds me of properties of exponents and square roots I've seen before. I know that square roots and exponents have specific rules that might come in handy here.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Option 1:** Use the property \\(\\sqrt{a \\cdot b} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}\\).\n- **Option 2:** Simplify the expression inside the square root by computing \\(2^2\\) and \\(3^4\\) first.\n- **Option 3:** Apply the exponent rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\) to simplify before taking the square root.\n  \nI think starting with simplifying inside the square root seems straightforward. But let's explore each option to see which feels more intuitive.\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Option 1 - Breaking Down the Square Root**\n**Thought Process:**\nI'll try using the property \\(\\sqrt{a \\cdot b} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot \\sqrt{b}\\). This seems like a direct way to handle multiple factors under the square root.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = \\sqrt{2^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3^4}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2 \\cdot 9\n\\]\n\\[\n= 18\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let's check if simplifying each part individually makes sense or if I missed something.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying Option 1**\n**Quick Check:**\n- \\(\\sqrt{2^2} = 2\\) is correct.\n- \\(\\sqrt{3^4} = 3^2 = 9\\) also seems correct.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**\nBut multiplying \\(2 \\cdot 9 = 18\\) feels off because squaring 18 doesn't equal the original expression. I might have mishandled the powers with the square root.\n\n**Realization:**\nOh! I forgot that when computing \\(\\sqrt{a^m}\\), the exponent \\(m\\) needs to be halved, but I already took the square root separately. This might have led to an error.\n\n### **Step 4: Revisiting Option 2 - Simplifying Inside the Square Root**\n**Thought Process:**\nMaybe breaking down the square root wasn't the best approach. Let's try simplifying the expression inside the square root before taking the square root itself.\n\n**Calculation:**\nFirst, compute \\(2^2\\) and \\(3^4\\):\n\\[\n2^2 = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n3^4 = 81\n\\]\n  \nNow, multiply these results:\n\\[\n4 \\times 81 = 324\n\\]\n  \nNow, take the square root:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{324} = 18\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis approach also gives us 18, but it aligns better with checking the work step by step.\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying Option 2 - Computing the Square Root of 324**\n**Quick Check:**\n- \\(18 \\times 18 = 324\\), so \\(\\sqrt{324} = 18\\) is correct.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**\nThis method feels more reliable because it simplifies the expression fully before taking the square root, reducing the chances of errors with exponents.\n\n**Insight:**\nBy simplifying inside the square root first, I avoided potential mishandling of exponents and ensured each step was clear and correct.\n\n### **Step 6: Considering Option 3 - Applying Exponent Rules Before the Square Root**\n**Thought Process:**\nAnother approach could be applying exponent rules to simplify the expression before taking the square root.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = \\sqrt{(2 \\cdot 3^2)^2} \\quad \\text{(since } 2^2 \\cdot 3^4 = (2 \\cdot 3^2)^2\\text{)}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{36} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis gives a different result (6) compared to the earlier methods (18). Something seems off here.\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying Option 3 - Double-Checking the Exponent Simplification**\n**Quick Check:**\n- Was the exponent simplification correct? \\((2 \\cdot 3^2)^2 = 4 \\times 9 = 36\\), which is correct.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**\nWait, my earlier methods computed \\(\\sqrt{324} = 18\\), but this method gives \\(\\sqrt{36} = 6\\). Let's re-examine the exponent rules used.\n\n**Realization:**\nI think there might be an error in how I applied the exponent rules. Let's break it down:\n\nOriginal Expression:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3^4}\n\\]\n  \nApplying the property \\(\\sqrt{a^m} = a^{m/2}\\):\n\\[\n2^{2/2} \\cdot 3^{4/2} = 2^1 \\cdot 3^2 = 2 \\cdot 9 = 18\n\\]\n\n**Mistake Identified:**\nThe simplification \\((2 \\cdot 3^2)^2\\) seems to have introduced an error. The exponent should have been halved correctly, but it led to \\((2 \\cdot 9)^2\\), which is \\(36\\), not \\(324\\).\n\n### **Step 8: Finalizing the Correct Approach**\n**Thought Process:**\nGiven that Option 2 consistently led to the correct answer and Option 3 introduced confusion, it's clear that simplifying inside the square root first was the most reliable method.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 81} = \\sqrt{324} = 18\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n- \\(18 \\times 18 = 324\\), which matches the original expression under the square root.\n- All steps align logically, confirming the correctness.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nAfter exploring multiple strategies, the most straightforward and accurate approach was to simplify the expression inside the square root first:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 81} = \\sqrt{324} = 18\n\\]\n\nBy reflecting and verifying each step, I ensured that the final answer is correct. Initially, attempting to break down the square root led to confusion, but reconsidering and methodically checking each part clarified the path to the correct solution.",
