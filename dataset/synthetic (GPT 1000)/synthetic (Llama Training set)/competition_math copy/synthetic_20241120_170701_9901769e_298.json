    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like how a human would naturally tackle a real-world problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, so we have a job that takes four painters **1.25 work-days** to complete at the same rate. Now, if only three painters are available, we need to find out how many work-days it will take them to finish the job. The answer should be expressed as a mixed number.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Proportion Approach:** Maybe I can set up a proportion since the number of painters and the work-days seem inversely related.\n- **Work Capacity Method:** Another idea is to calculate the total painter-work-days needed and then divide by the number of available painters.\n- **Rate Comparison:** I could compare the rates of work done by different numbers of painters.\n\nHmm, the **Work Capacity Method** feels like it might give me a clear path by focusing on the total work needed. Let's try that first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Total Painter-Work-Days**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo find out how many total painter-work-days are required, I can multiply the number of painters by the number of work-days they take to complete the job together.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Painter-Work-Days} = 4 \\text{ painters} \\times 1.25 \\text{ work-days} = 5 \\text{ painter-work-days} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait, that seems a bit off. Multiplying the number of painters by the work-days doesn't directly make sense because the work-days already account for all four painters. Maybe I need to re-think this.\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, let me think about it differently. The **1.25 work-days** is the total time for four painters working together. So, if I want to find out the total work in painter-work-days, I should consider that it's already accounted for by all four painters working over 1.25 days.\n\n**Realization:**\nHmm, perhaps calculating the total work in terms of painter-days isn't necessary right now. Maybe I should focus on how the reduction in the number of painters affects the time required.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Proportion Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf four painters take 1.25 work-days, then reducing the number of painters to three should increase the time needed. I can set up a proportion to find the new time.\n\n**Setting Up the Proportion:**\nLet me denote the unknown number of work-days needed by three painters as \\( x \\). The proportion would be:\n\\[ \n\\frac{4 \\text{ painters}}{1.25 \\text{ work-days}} = \\frac{3 \\text{ painters}}{x \\text{ work-days}} \n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\nCross-multiplying to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ \n4 \\times x = 3 \\times 1.25 \n\\]\n\\[ \n4x = 3.75 \n\\]\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{3.75}{4} = 0.9375 \\text{ work-days} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait a minute\u20140.9375 work-days seems too short. That can't be right because reducing the number of painters should increase the time, not decrease it.\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, I must have set up the proportion incorrectly. Let me re-examine the relationship between the number of painters and the time required.\n\n**Realization:**\nOh, I see where I went wrong. The proportion should actually reflect that reducing the number of painters increases the workdays, so I might need to set it up differently or try another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Revisiting the Work Capacity Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nMaybe the proportion approach wasn't the best. Let's go back to the **Work Capacity Method** and think about it more carefully.\n\n**Calculation:**\nIf four painters can complete the job in 1.25 days, then the total amount of work required can be thought of in terms of painter-work-days. So:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Total Work} = 4 \\text{ painters} \\times 1.25 \\text{ work-days} = 5 \\text{ painter-days} \n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:**\nWait, earlier I miscalculated the painter-days. Actually, it's **5 painter-days** of work needed.\n\n**Next Step:**\nNow, if only three painters are available, I need to divide the total work by the number of painters to find the number of days required.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Number of Days with Three Painters} = \\frac{5 \\text{ painter-days}}{3 \\text{ painters}} = \\frac{5}{3} \\text{ days} \n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**\n\\[ \n\\frac{5}{3} = 1 \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ days} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nThis makes sense because reducing the number of painters from four to three would increase the time needed to complete the job.\n\n**Reflection:**\nYes, this aligns with the expectation. The mixed number **1 \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) days** is a reasonable duration for three painters to finish the job.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, let's quickly verify if this solution makes sense.\n\n**Verification:**\n- Originally, four painters take **1.25 days**. \n- So, the total work is **5 painter-days**.\n- With three painters, it takes **\\(\\frac{5}{3}\\) days**, which is **1 \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) days**.\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this proportion align with our expectation? Yes, because reducing the workforce from four to three painters would naturally extend the time required to complete the job.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nThe solution seems correct now. By considering the total painter-days and adjusting for the reduced number of painters, we arrive at a logical and accurate duration.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nIf only three painters are available, it will take them **1 \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) work-days** to finish the job.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy brainstorming different strategies and carefully reflecting on each step, I was able to identify the correct approach. Initially, the proportion method led to an incorrect conclusion, but revisiting the **Work Capacity Method** helped me accurately calculate the time required with three painters. Throughout the process, checking and adjusting the approach ensured the final answer was correct.\n\nThis step-by-step journey highlights the importance of exploring various strategies, reflecting on their validity, and being open to changing direction when something doesn't seem right\u2014just like tackling a real-world problem.",

  "ground_truth": "The number of workers will be inversely proportional to the time needed to complete the job.  This means that the product $(\\text{number of workers})\\times(\\text{days to complete job})$ will be a constant.  In this case, that constant will be: $$4\\times 1.25=5$$ For three workers, the product will remain the same.  Let $D$ equal the number of days needed for three workers to complete the job.
