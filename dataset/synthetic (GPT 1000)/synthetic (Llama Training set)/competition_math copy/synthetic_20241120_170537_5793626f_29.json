    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking for correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let\u2019s begin by thoroughly understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nOkay, so we have two people, Bonnie and Roark. Bonnie makes a cube frame using 12 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long. Roark uses 1-inch-long pieces to create multiple unit cube frames, and the total volume of his cubes matches the volume of Bonnie\u2019s cube.\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio of the total length of Bonnie\u2019s wire to the total length of Roark\u2019s wire, expressed as a common fraction.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **Volume Comparison:** Since both have the same volume, I should start by determining the volumes involved.\n- **Wire Length Calculation:** After finding the volumes, I\u2019ll need to figure out how Roark constructs his frames and compute the total wire length he uses.\n- **Ratio Determination:** Finally, I'll set up the ratio of Bonnie's wire length to Roark's and simplify it.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems like a classic problem involving volume and wire length of cube frames. I need to ensure I accurately connect the volume information to the wire length for Roark.\n\n**Potential Challenges:**  \n- Making sure the number of 1-inch cubes Roark uses is correct.\n- Accurately calculating the total wire length used by Roark.\n\n**Strategy Check:**  \nI\u2019ll start by calculating the volume of Bonnie\u2019s cube to determine the side lengths involved. Then, I\u2019ll figure out how many 1-inch cubes Roark needs to match this volume and calculate the total wire length for his frames. Finally, I\u2019ll find the ratio of their wire lengths.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Bonnie\u2019s Cube Volume**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo find the volume, I need to determine the side length of Bonnie\u2019s cube. Since she uses 12 pieces of wire, and each cube has 12 edges, each edge must be made of 1 wire piece. Therefore, the side length will be equal to the length of each wire piece used.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Determine Number of Edges:**  \n   A cube has **12 edges**.\n\n2. **Total Wire Pieces Used:**  \n   Bonnie uses **12 pieces** of wire, each **6 inches** long.\n\n3. **Wire Length Per Edge:**  \n   Since each edge of the cube frame is made of one wire piece, the **side length \\( s \\)** of Bonnie\u2019s cube is:\n   \\[\n   s = 6 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Volume \\( V \\):**  \n   The volume of a cube is:\n   \\[\n   V = s^3 = 6^3 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense because if all edges are 6 inches, the volume would be 216 cubic inches. So, Bonnie\u2019s cube has a volume of 216 cubic inches.\n\n**Check:**  \n\\( 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216 \\) \u2014 Correct!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining Roark\u2019s Cube Frames**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nRoark uses 1-inch-long pieces of wire to create unit cubes (1-inch cubes). To find out how many such cubes he makes, I need to determine the total volume of these cubes that add up to 216 cubic inches.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Volume of One Unit Cube:**  \n   Each unit cube has a volume of:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\text{ cubic inch}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Volume of Roark\u2019s Cubes:**  \n   Roark\u2019s cubes collectively have a volume of 216 cubic inches.\n\n3. **Number of Unit Cubes \\( N \\):**  \n   The number of unit cubes Roark makes is:\n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{216}{1} = 216\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems logical. Roark is making 216 unit cubes, each with a volume of 1 cubic inch, to match the total volume of Bonnie\u2019s cube.\n\n**Check:**  \n216 unit cubes \u00d7 1 cubic inch per cube = 216 cubic inches \u2014 Correct!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Total Wire Length for Roark\u2019s Frames**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEach unit cube frame consists 12 edges, each 1 inch long. Therefore, to find the total length of wire Roark uses, I need to multiply the number of unit cubes by the number of edges per cube and the length of each edge.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Number of Edges per Unit Cube:**  \n   Each unit cube has **12 edges**.\n\n2. **Total Wire Length for One Cube Frame:**  \n   Each edge is **1 inch**, so the total length per cube is:\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 1 = 12 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Wire Length for All 216 Cubes:**  \n   Therefore, the total wire length \\( L_{\\text{Roark}} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   L_{\\text{Roark}} = 216 \\times 12 = 2,592 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis calculation aligns with the problem's requirements. Roark uses a significant amount of wire to create 216 unit cube frames, each needing 12 inches of wire.\n\n**Check:**  \n216 \u00d7 12 = 2,592 inches \u2014 Correct!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Total Wire Length for Bonnie\u2019s Cube Frame**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBonnie uses 12 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long, to create her cube frame. So, the total length of her wire is straightforward to calculate.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Total Wire Length for Bonnie \\( L_{\\text{Bonnie}} \\):**  \n   \\[\n   L_{\\text{Bonnie}} = 12 \\times 6 = 72 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis is a direct calculation. Bonnie\u2019s frame uses 12 pieces of wire, each 6 inches long, totaling 72 inches.\n\n**Check:**  \n12 \u00d7 6 = 72 inches \u2014 Correct!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Determining the Ratio of Wire Lengths**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have both total wire lengths, I can find the ratio of Bonnie\u2019s wire length to Roark\u2019s wire length. This ratio will be:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{L_{\\text{Bonnie}}}{L_{\\text{Roark}}} = \\frac{72}{2,592}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Simplify the Ratio:**  \n   To simplify, I'll divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (Gcd).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gcd of 72 and 2,592} = 72\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{72}{2,592} = \\frac{72 \\div 72}{2,592 \\div 72} = \\frac{1}{36}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis simplification makes sense. The ratio reduces to \\( \\frac{1}{36} \\), indicating that for every inch of wire Bonnie uses, Roark uses 36 inches.\n\n**Check:**  \n72 \u00f7 72 = 1  \n2,592 \u00f7 72 = 36  \nSo, \\( \\frac{1}{36} \\) \u2014 Correct!\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \n- **Volume Consistency:** Both Bonnie and Roark's setups have a total volume of 216 cubic inches.\n- **Wire Length Calculations:** Each step involved straightforward multiplications and divisions based on the given wire lengths.\n- **Ratio Accuracy:** The final ratio simplifies correctly, reflecting the relationship between their total wire lengths.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe ratio of the total length of Bonnie\u2019s wire to the total length of Roark\u2019s wire is **\\( \\frac{1}{36} \\)**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nThis problem required connecting the volume of cubes to the wire lengths used in their frames. By systematically calculating each person's wire lengths and simplifying their ratio, I was able to arrive at the correct answer. Throughout the process, I ensured each step was checked for correctness, adapting the approach as needed to maintain accuracy.",

  "ground_truth": "The total length of Bonnie's wire is $12\\cdot6=72$ inches, while her total volume is $6^3=216$ cubic inches. Each of Roark's unit cubes has volume $1$ cubic inch, so he needs $216$ cubes.\n\nSince each cube has $12$ edges, each of Roark's cubes has $12\\cdot1=12$ inches of wire. So his $216$ cubes have a total of $216\\cdot12$ inches of wire.\n\nSo the desired fraction is $\\dfrac{72}{216\\cdot12}=\\dfrac{6}{216}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{36}}$."
