    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, mirroring the natural thought process a human would go through\u2014brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and even adjusting strategies along the way.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem, we have two vectors:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ p \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ q \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe key points are that these vectors are **equal in magnitude** and **orthogonal** (meaning they are at right angles to each other). We're asked to find the ordered pair \\((p, q)\\).\n\nInitially, a couple of strategies pop into my mind:\n\n1. **Magnitude Equality:** I can set up an equation based on the magnitudes of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) being equal.\n   \n2. **Orthogonality Condition:** I can use the dot product to establish that the vectors are orthogonal.\n\nReflecting on this, I think both conditions are necessary to find \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). So, I'll probably need to set up two equations\u2014one from each condition\u2014and solve the resulting system.\n\nBut before diving in, let me just double-check that this approach makes sense. Yes, equal magnitude and orthogonality are sufficient to define the relationship between the two vectors. So, let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Set Up the Magnitude Equality Equation**\n\nThought Process: Since \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) have the same magnitude, I can set their magnitude equations equal to each other.\n\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a}\\| = \\|\\mathbf{b}\\|\n\\]\n\nMagnitude of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a}\\| = \\sqrt{3^2 + p^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + p^2 + 1} = \\sqrt{10 + p^2}\n\\]\n\nMagnitude of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{b}\\| = \\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2 + q^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 1 + q^2} = \\sqrt{5 + q^2}\n\\]\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{10 + p^2} = \\sqrt{5 + q^2}\n\\]\n\nReflection: This equation relates \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) directly through their magnitudes. Seems straightforward.\n\n**Check:** Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots is a logical next step. Let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Square Both Sides to Remove Square Roots**\n\nThought Process: To simplify the equation, squaring both sides will help eliminate the square roots.\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{10 + p^2})^2 = (\\sqrt{5 + q^2})^2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n10 + p^2 = 5 + q^2\n\\]\n\nReflection: This equation is much cleaner. Now, I can rearrange it to express \\(p^2 - q^2\\).\n\n**Check:** Let me rearrange it:\n\n\\[\np^2 - q^2 = 5 - 10\n\\]\n\\[\np^2 - q^2 = -5\n\\]\n\nWait a minute\u2014this suggests that \\(p^2\\) is less than \\(q^2\\) by 5. That\u2019s an interesting relationship.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Set Up the Orthogonality Condition Equation**\n\nThought Process: Now, I need to use the orthogonality condition. Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = 0\n\\]\n\nCalculating the dot product:\n\n\\[\n3 \\cdot 2 + p \\cdot 1 + (-1) \\cdot q = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n6 + p - q = 0\n\\]\n\nReflection: So, I have a second equation: \\(6 + p - q = 0\\). Now I have a system of equations:\n\n1. \\(p^2 - q^2 = -5\\)\n2. \\(p - q + 6 = 0\\)\n\n**Check:** This seems like a manageable system to solve. I can substitute one equation into the other.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Solve the System of Equations**\n\nThought Process: To solve for \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), I can use substitution or elimination. Here, substitution might be easier since the second equation can be rearranged to express one variable in terms of the other.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\n\\[\np - q + 6 = 0 \\implies p - q = -6 \\implies p = q - 6\n\\]\n\nReflection: Now I can substitute \\(p = q - 6\\) into equation 1.\n\n**Check:** Let\u2019s substitute and see if it works.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Substitute \\(p = q - 6\\) into \\(p^2 - q^2 = -5\\)**\n\nThought Process: By substituting \\(p\\) in terms of \\(q\\) into the first equation, I should be able to solve for \\(q\\).\n\n\\[\n(q - 6)^2 - q^2 = -5\n\\]\n\nExpanding \\((q - 6)^2\\):\n\n\\[\nq^2 - 12q + 36 - q^2 = -5\n\\]\n\nReflection: The \\(q^2\\) terms cancel out. Let\u2019s simplify the equation.\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\n-12q + 36 = -5\n\\]\n\\[\n-12q = -5 - 36\n\\]\n\\[\n-12q = -41\n\\]\n\\[\nq = \\frac{-41}{-12} = \\frac{41}{12}\n\\]\n\nHold on\u2014does \\(\\frac{41}{12}\\) simplify to any nice fraction? Let me see... No, it looks like a mixed number, but keeping it as an improper fraction is fine.\n\nReflection: This value for \\(q\\) seems reasonable. Now, let me find \\(p\\) using \\(p = q - 6\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Calculate \\(p\\) Using \\(q = \\frac{41}{12}\\)**\n\nThought Process: I need to substitute \\(q\\) back into the equation \\(p = q - 6\\) to find \\(p\\).\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{41}{12} - 6\n\\]\n\nConvert 6 into a fraction with a denominator of 12:\n\n\\[\n6 = \\frac{72}{12}\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{41}{12} - \\frac{72}{12} = \\frac{41 - 72}{12} = \\frac{-31}{12}\n\\]\n\nReflection: So, \\(p = \\frac{-31}{12}\\) and \\(q = \\frac{41}{12}\\). These values seem to satisfy both the magnitude and orthogonality conditions. Let's put them into the ordered pair.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n(p, q) = \\left(\\frac{-31}{12}, \\frac{41}{12}\\right)\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nLet me double-check if these values indeed satisfy both conditions:\n\n1. **Magnitude Equality:**\n\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{a}\\| = \\sqrt{10 + \\left(\\frac{-31}{12}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{10 + \\frac{961}{144}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1440 + 961}{144}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2401}{144}} = \\frac{49}{12}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\|\\mathbf{b}\\| = \\sqrt{5 + \\left(\\frac{41}{12}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{5 + \\frac{1681}{144}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{720 + 1681}{144}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2401}{144}} = \\frac{49}{12}\n\\]\n\nBoth magnitudes are equal: \\(\\frac{49}{12}\\).\n\n2. **Orthogonality:**\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = 3 \\cdot 2 + \\left(\\frac{-31}{12}\\right) \\cdot 1 + (-1) \\cdot \\frac{41}{12} = 6 - \\frac{31}{12} - \\frac{41}{12} = 6 - \\frac{31 + 41}{12} = 6 - \\frac{72}{12} = 6 - 6 = 0\n\\]\n\nThe dot product is zero, confirming orthogonality.\n\nReflection: The final checks confirm that the ordered pair \\(\\left(\\frac{-31}{12}, \\frac{41}{12}\\right)\\) satisfies both the magnitude equality and the orthogonality condition. The approach looks correct, and the calculations seem accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy carefully setting up and solving a system of equations derived from the given conditions of equal magnitude and orthogonality, we've determined that:\n\n\\[\n(p, q) = \\left(\\frac{-31}{12}, \\frac{41}{12}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThroughout the process, reflecting on each step ensured that the approach remained correct, and checking the final values against the original conditions confirmed their validity.
