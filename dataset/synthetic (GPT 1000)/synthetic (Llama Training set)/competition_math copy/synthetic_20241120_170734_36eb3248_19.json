    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just as I would if I were solving it for myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my approach frequently, and make sure to check my work along the way. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \\((81)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 3^m\\), a few initial ideas come to mind:\n\n1. **Recognize Base Numbers:** I remember that \\(81\\) is a power of \\(3\\), specifically \\(3^4\\). This makes me think that maybe rewriting \\(81\\) in terms of \\(3\\) could simplify the problem.\n\n2. **Properties of Exponents:** I know there are properties of exponents and radicals that might help here, like \\((a^n)^{\\frac{1}{m}} = a^{\\frac{n}{m}}\\).\n\n3. **Logarithms:** Another approach could be using logarithms, but that seems more complex for this problem since it's straightforward with exponents.\n\n4. **Checking Ideas:** Wait, using logarithms might complicate things unnecessarily. Since \\(81\\) is easily expressible as a power of \\(3\\), maybe I should stick with that.\n\nI'm leaning towards rewriting \\(81\\) in terms of base \\(3\\). Let's explore that.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1:** Rewrite \\(81\\) as a Power of \\(3\\)\n\n- **Thought:** If I can express \\(81\\) as \\(3^k\\), then taking the square root should be straightforward.\n- **Potential Issue:** Need to ensure the exponent is correct.\n\n**Strategy 2:** Use Properties of Exponents\n\n- **Thought:** Recall that \\((a^n)^{\\frac{1}{m}} = a^{\\frac{n}{m}}\\). Maybe applying this directly could help.\n- **Potential Issue:** This might be too abstract without rewriting \\(81\\) first.\n\n**Strategy 3:** Simplify the Left Side Step-by-Step\n\n- **Thought:** Start with simplifying \\((81)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) directly by breaking down \\(81\\).\n- **Potential Issue:** Need to verify each step to avoid mistakes.\n\n**Reflection:** Given that \\(81\\) is a well-known power of \\(3\\), Strategy 1 seems the most straightforward. Let's go with that and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Rewriting \\(81\\) as a Power of \\(3\\)**\n\n**Action:** Express \\(81\\) in terms of base \\(3\\).\n\n- **Calculation:** \n  \\[\n  81 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 3^4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Thought Process:** \n  - *Wait, I remember \\(3^4\\) because \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\), and \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\), then \\(27 \\times 3 = 81\\).*\n  - *Does this match? Yes, \\(3^4 = 81\\). So, that seems correct.*\n\n**Check:** \n- *Is \\(81\\) really \\(3^4\\)? Let me verify: \\(3^2 = 9\\), and \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\), then \\(27 \\times 3 = 81\\).*\n\n**Reflection:** \n- *This checks out. Rewriting \\(81\\) as \\(3^4\\) feels like the right move.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Square Root**\n\n**Action:** Now, take the square root of both sides.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  (81)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (3^4)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  (3^4)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 3^{4 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 3^2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Thought Process:** \n  - *According to the property \\((a^n)^{\\frac{1}{m}} = a^{\\frac{n}{m}}\\), multiplying exponents makes sense here.*\n  - *So, \\(3^{4 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 3^2\\).*\n\n**Check:** \n- *Does \\(3^2\\) make sense? Let's see: \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).*\n\n**Reflection:** \n- *Taking the square root seems to work perfectly here. \\(3^2 = 9\\), and that feels right.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Equating to Find \\(m\\)**\n\n**Action:** Set \\(3^m = 3^2\\) to find \\(m\\).\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  3^m = 3^2 \\implies m = 2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Thought Process:** \n  - *Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal.*\n  - *Therefore, \\(m = 2\\).*\n\n**Check:** \n- *Quick check: Does \\(3^2 = 9\\)? Yes, \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\), which aligns with \\((81)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 9\\).*\n\n**Reflection:** \n- *Everything checks out. By equating the exponents, I confidently conclude that \\(m = 2\\).*\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n- **Verification:** \n  - *Let\u2019s verify the entire process step by step:*\n    - Rewrote \\(81\\) as \\(3^4\\) \u2014 Correct.\n    - Took the square root, applying exponent rules \u2014 Correct.\n    - Set exponents equal to solve for \\(m\\) \u2014 Correct.*\n\n- **Final Check:** \n  - *Does \\((81)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 3^2\\)?*\n  - *Calculating \\((81)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\):*\n    \\[\n    (81)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{81} = 9\n    \\]\n  - *And \\(3^2 = 9\\) \u2014 Matches perfectly.*\n\n- **Conclusion:** \n  - *The approach was correct, and the solution \\(m = 2\\) is verified.*\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies and carefully checking each step, I determined that \\(m = 2\\) for the equation \\((81)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 3^m\\). Rewriting \\(81\\) as a power of \\(3\\) was key in simplifying the problem and arriving at the correct solution. Throughout the process, reflecting and verifying each step ensured accuracy and confidence in the final answer.",
