    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem as if we're thinking through it step-by-step, exploring different strategies, reflecting and checking our work along the way. Here's how I would naturally approach converting the rectangular coordinates \\((6, 2\\sqrt{3})\\) to polar coordinates \\((r, \\theta)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question, converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates reminds me of the time I dealt with trigonometry and coordinate systems. I remember that in polar coordinates, points are described using a radius \\(r\\) and an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the positive x-axis, rather than x and y values like in rectangular coordinates.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Wait, so I need to find \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\)? How do I do that?**\n- I recall that there's a relationship between rectangular and polar coordinates. Maybe using Pythagorean theorem for \\(r\\) and trigonometric functions for \\(\\theta\\)?\n- **But I also remember an alternative method involving complex numbers... Would that apply here?**\n- I think I'll start with the Pythagorean theorem approach since it's more straightforward and familiar.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Radius \\(r\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find \\(r\\), I need the distance from the origin to the point \\((6, 2\\sqrt{3})\\).\n- I remember the formula: \\(r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\).\n- Let\u2019s plug in the values.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nx = 6, \\quad y = 2\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{6^2 + (2\\sqrt{3})^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{36 + 4 \\times 3} = \\sqrt{36 + 12} = \\sqrt{48}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{16 \\times 3} = 4\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does \\(r = 4\\sqrt{3}\\) make sense?**\n- It seems reasonable since the squared components add up to 48, and taking the square root gives a multiple of 4 and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\n- **Okay, I think that's correct. Moving on to \\(\\theta\\).**\n\n### **Step 2: Determining the Angle \\(\\theta\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, I need to find \\(\\theta\\), the angle with the positive x-axis.\n- I remember that the tangent of the angle is the ratio of \\(y\\) to \\(x\\): \\(\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{y}{x}\\).\n- **But wait, does this directly give me \\(\\theta\\)? Maybe I need to consider the quadrant too.**\n- Since both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive, the point is in the first quadrant, so \\(\\theta\\) should be between \\(0\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{6} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) align with the quadrant?**\n- Yes, since both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive, \\(\\theta\\) should indeed be \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\).\n- **This seems correct.**\n\n### **Step 3: Compiling the Polar Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- So now I have \\(r = 4\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\).\n- **Wait, I need to make sure \\(\\theta\\) is in the range \\(0 \\leq \\theta < 2\\pi\\).**\n- Since \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) is already between 0 and \\(2\\pi\\), it's fine.\n\n**Polar Coordinates:**\n\\[\n(4\\sqrt{3}, \\frac{\\pi}{6})\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does this make sense?**\n- The radius is positive, and the angle is in the correct range. \n- **I think this is the correct answer.**\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Alternative Approach: Using Complex Numbers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Wait, I remember that polar coordinates can also be represented using complex numbers.**\n- The point \\((x, y)\\) can be written as \\(x + iy\\), and then using Euler's formula, you can convert it to polar.\n- **But this seems more complex than the straightforward method I already used. Maybe it's not necessary here.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does it add value?**\n- Since I already have a clear and correct answer using the standard method, introducing complex numbers might complicate things unnecessarily.\n- **I think it's better to stick with the Pythagorean and trigonometric approach.**\n\n### **Quick Check:**\n\n- **Wait, let me quickly verify the calculations again:**\n  - \\(r = \\sqrt{6^2 + (2\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 12} = \\sqrt{48} = 4\\sqrt{3}\\)\n  - \\(\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{6} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\Rightarrow \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\)\n- Everything checks out. **I\u2019m confident in the answer.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nAfter carefully calculating and verifying each step, the polar coordinates for the point \\((6, 2\\sqrt{3})\\) are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(4\\sqrt{3}, \\frac{\\pi}{6})}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThe key throughout this process was to approach the problem methodically, starting with a familiar strategy, checking each step for correctness, and being open to exploring alternative methods if needed. Reflexively checking whether the intermediate results make sense helped ensure the final answer was accurate.",
