    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it manually. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll tackle it:\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \\( x^2 + y^2 = -2x - 10y - 16 \\), I recognize that it resembles the standard form of a circle's equation:\n\n\\[\n(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( (h, k) \\) is the center and \\( r \\) is the radius. However, the given equation doesn't immediately fit this form because of the negative coefficients on the right side.\n\nMy intuition tells me that maybe **completing the square** could help here\u2014transforming the equation into the standard form by rewriting it to identify the center directly. But then, I consider other methods, like **rearranging the equation** or **using the general form of a circle**. Let\u2019s brainstorm a bit:\n\n- **Completing the Square:** This seems promising since it can convert any quadratic equation into the circle's standard form.\n- **Rearranging Terms:** Maybe moving terms around could clarify the structure.\n- **Using Coordinates of the Center Formula:** If I remember correctly, for circles, the center can be found via specific relationships between coefficients.\n\nI\u2019ll start with **completing the square**, as it aligns well with transforming quadratic equations into their standard form. If that doesn\u2019t work or feels messy, I\u2019ll pivot to another method.\n\n### **Step 1: Completing the Square**\n\nLet\u2019s try completing the square for both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) terms.\n\n**Equation:**  \n\\[ x^2 + y^2 = -2x - 10y - 16 \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo complete the square, I need to move the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) terms to one side and the constant to the other side. Then, I\u2019ll adjust the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) terms to fit the perfect square trinomial format.\n\n**Moving \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) terms:**  \n\\[ x^2 + y^2 + 2x + 10y = -16 \\]\n\n**Focusing on \\( x \\) terms:**  \n\\[ x^2 + 2x \\]  \nTo complete the square:\n- Take half of the coefficient of \\( x \\): \\( \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\)\n- Square it: \\( 1^2 = 1 \\)\n  \n**Adding and subtracting inside the equation:**  \n\\[ (x^2 + 2x + 1) - 1 \\]\n  \nBut, I can\u2019t just add 1 without balancing the equation. So, I\u2019ll add 1 to both sides:\n\n\\[ (x^2 + 2x + 1) = -16 + 1 \\]  \n\\[ (x + 1)^2 = -15 \\]\n\n**Wait a second!**  \nI end up with \\( (x + 1)^2 = -15 \\). \n\n**Realization:**  \nThis can't be right because the square of a real number can\u2019t be negative. Something feels off. Maybe I mismanaged the signs or the completion process.\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me double-check my steps:\n\n- Did I correctly complete the square?\n- Did I add and subtract 1 appropriately to balance the equation?\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOh! I see the mistake. Initially, I intended to complete the square but ended up with an impossible equation. It suggests that perhaps the equation doesn\u2019t represent a real circle\u2014maybe it represents a circle in the complex plane or is misconfigured.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nGiven that completing the square led me to an inconsistency, I\u2019ll try **rearranging the equation** to see if another pattern emerges.\n\n### **Step 2: Rearranging the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s reorganize the equation to see if it aligns more closely with the standard circle equation.\n\n**Original Equation:**  \n\\[ x^2 + y^2 = -2x - 10y - 16 \\]\n\n**Rearranging:**  \n\\[ x^2 + 2x + y^2 + 10y = -16 \\]\n\n**Grouping \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) terms separately:**  \n\\[ (x^2 + 2x) + (y^2 + 10y) = -16 \\]\n\n**Attempting to complete the square for \\( y \\) terms:**  \n\\[ y^2 + 10y \\]  \nHalf of 10 is 5, and squaring it gives 25.\n\n**Adding and subtracting inside the equation:**  \n\\[ (y^2 + 10y + 25) - 25 \\]  \n\\[ (y + 5)^2 - 25 \\]\n\n**Now, adjusting the equation:**  \n\\[ (x^2 + 2x) + (y + 5)^2 - 25 = -16 \\]  \n\\[ (x^2 + 2x) + (y + 5)^2 = -16 + 25 \\]  \n\\[ (x^2 + 2x) + (y + 5)^2 = 9 \\]\n\n### **Step 3: Completing the Square for \\( x \\) Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow let\u2019s complete the square for the \\( x \\) terms to write the equation in the standard circle format.\n\n**Equation So Far:**  \n\\[ (x^2 + 2x) + (y + 5)^2 = 9 \\]\n\n**Focusing on \\( x \\) terms:**  \n\\[ x^2 + 2x \\]  \nHalf of 2 is 1, and squaring it gives 1.\n\n**Adding and subtracting inside the equation:**  \n\\[ (x^2 + 2x + 1) - 1 \\]  \n\\[ (x + 1)^2 - 1 \\]\n\n**Substituting back into the equation:**  \n\\[ ((x + 1)^2 - 1) + (y + 5)^2 = 9 \\]  \n\\[ (x + 1)^2 - 1 + (y + 5)^2 = 9 \\]\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**  \n\\[ (x + 1)^2 + (y + 5)^2 - 1 = 9 \\]  \n\\[ (x + 1)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 10 \\]\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying the Center**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I have the equation in the standard form of a circle, I can easily identify the center \\( (h, k) \\).\n\n**Standard Form of a Circle:**  \n\\[ (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \\]  \nHere, \\( h = -1 \\), \\( k = -5 \\), and \\( r^2 = 10 \\).\n\n**Center:**  \n\\[ (h, k) = (-1, -5) \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense because completing the square has transformed the original equation into a familiar format, revealing the center directly.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating \\( x + y \\)**\n\n**Task:**  \nFind \\( x + y \\) where \\( (x, y) \\) is the center of the circle.\n\n**Given Center:**  \n\\[ x = -1, \\quad y = -5 \\]\n\n**Calculating \\( x + y \\):**  \n\\[ x + y = -1 + (-5) = -6 \\]\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s double-check each step to ensure everything aligns:\n\n1. **Completing the Square for \\( x \\):**  \n   - Added 1 to complete \\( x^2 + 2x \\) \u2192 \\( (x + 1)^2 - 1 \\)\n\n2. **Completing the Square for \\( y \\):**  \n   - Added 25 to complete \\( y^2 + 10y \\) \u2192 \\( (y + 5)^2 - 25 \\)\n\n3. **Rearranging the Equation:**  \n   - Combined completed squares and simplified to standard circle form \u2192 \\( (x + 1)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 10 \\)\n\n4. **Identifying the Center:**  \n   - Extracted center coordinates \\( (-1, -5) \\)\n\n5. **Calculating \\( x + y \\):**  \n   - Sum of coordinates gives \\( -6 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll steps logically follow one another, and the final answer \\( x + y = -6 \\) makes sense within the context of the problem.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy methodically completing the square and reorganizing the equation, I transformed the given circle equation into its standard form. This process revealed the center of the circle as \\( (-1, -5) \\), leading to the sum \\( x + y = -6 \\). Although the initial attempt at completing the square introduced an inconsistency, recognizing and correcting the approach guided me to the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[ x + y = -6 \\]",

  "ground_truth": "We will complete the square to determine the standard form equation of the circle. Shifting all but the constant term from the RHS to the LHS, we have $x^2+2x+y^2+10y=-16$. Completing the square in $x$, we add $(2/2)^2=1$ to both sides. Completing the square in $y$, we add $(10/2)^2=25$ to both sides. The equation becomes \\begin{align*}\nx^2+2x+y^2+10y&=-16\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x^2+2x+1+y^2+10y+25&=10\\\\\n\\Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y+5)^2&=10\n\\end{align*} Thus, the center of the circle is at point $(-1,-5)$ so $x+y=-1+(-5)=\\boxed{-6}$."
