    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's dive into this problem, exploring different strategies and reflecting along the way to ensure we're on the right track.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the problem, I think about probability and how it's generally calculated by looking at favorable outcomes over total outcomes. \n\n**Initial Impressions:**\n- There are two boxes, **A** and **B**, each with numbered tiles.\n- We're drawing one tile from each box.\n- The conditions are: \n  - Tile from **A** must be less than 15.\n  - Tile from **B** must be either even or greater than 25.\n\nThis reminds me of probability problems where you deal with multiple conditions, possibly involving **AND** and **OR** scenarios. \n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **List Out Possibilities:** Maybe I can list all the tiles and see which ones meet the conditions.\n2. **Probability of Each Event Separately:** Calculate the probabilities of each individual condition and then combine them.\n3. **Use Complementary Probability:** Find the probability of the opposite and subtract from 1.\n4. **Simulate the Draws:** Though more complex, simulating might give an insight.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nListing all possibilities seems straightforward but might get messy. Calculating each probability separately and then combining them logically makes sense. Using complementary probability could simplify things, but I'm not sure if it's needed here.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding Box A's Condition**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's start with Box **A**. We need the tile drawn to be less than 15.\n\n**Box A:**\n- Tiles numbered 1 through 20.\n- So, the favorable tiles are: 1, 2, ..., 14 (total of 14 tiles).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Number of favorable outcomes for Box A} = 14 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, there are 20 tiles total. So, the probability would be:\n\\[ \n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{14}{20} = \\frac{7}{10} \n\\]\nSeems straightforward. The fraction simplifies nicely.\n\n**Check:**\nDoes 14 out of 20 make sense? Yes, there are 14 numbers less than 15 in the range 1 to 20.\n\n### **Step 2: Understanding Box B's Condition**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, let's tackle Box **B**. The tile needs to be either even or greater than 25.\n\n**Box B:**\n- Tiles numbered 11 through 30.\n- **Even tiles:** 12, 14, 16, ..., 30 (total of 10 tiles).\n- **Greater than 25:** 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 (total of 5 tiles).\n\n**Calculation:**\nBut wait, some tiles greater than 25 are also even. We need to avoid double counting.\n\n**Set Operations:**\n- **Even tiles:** {12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30}\n- **Greater than 25:** {26, 27, 28, 29, 30}\n\n**Union of Even or Greater than 25:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Union} = \\text{Even} \\cup \\text{Greater than 25} \n\\]\n\n**Removing Overlap:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Overlap} = \\{26, 28, 30\\} \n\\]\nSo, each is counted twice.\n\n**Total Unique Favorable Outcomes:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Total} = \\text{Even} + \\text{Greater than 25} - \\text{Overlap} \n\\]\n\\[ \n\\text{Total} = 10 + 5 - 3 = 12 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, let me double-check. There are 10 even tiles and 5 tiles greater than 25. But 3 tiles (26, 28, 30) are both even and greater than 25, so subtracting them makes sense.\n\n**Check:**\nIs 12 out of 20 realistic? Let's list them to be sure.\n\n**List Verification:**\n- **Even tiles:** 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30\n- **Greater than 25:** 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n- **Unique Union:** 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n- Total = 12 tiles\n\nSeems correct! The union gives 12 unique tiles.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Combined Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need to find the probability that both conditions are met. Since drawing from both boxes are independent events, I can multiply their probabilities.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Combined Probability} = P(\\text{Box A}) \\times P(\\text{Box B}) = \\frac{7}{10} \\times \\frac{12}{20}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{20} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{10} \\times \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{21}{50}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nMultiplying the probabilities makes sense since these are independent events. The fraction simplifies nicely.\n\n**Check:**\nIs \\(\\frac{21}{50}\\) a valid probability? Yes, it's between 0 and 1.\n\n**Final Verification:**\nLet me quickly verify if my counts were correct.\n\n- **Box A:** 14 tiles less than 15 out of 20 \u2192 \\(\\frac{7}{10}\\)\n- **Box B:** 12 unique tiles out of 20 \u2192 \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\)\n- Combined \u2192 \\(\\frac{21}{50}\\)\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{21}{50}}\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nBy breaking down each box's conditions and carefully ensuring that overlapping cases were handled correctly, I arrived at the combined probability of \\(\\frac{21}{50}\\). Reflecting throughout the process helped catch potential overlaps and confirm that the calculations were accurate.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the two events are independent, we consider each separately. The probability of the tile from A being less than 15 is equal to $\\frac{14}{20} = \\frac{7}{10}$. The probability of a tile from B being even or greater than 25 is $\\frac{10+2}{20} = \\frac{3}{5}$. So we multiply the probabilities for the independent events, giving us probability $\\frac{7}{10} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = \\boxed{\\frac{21}{50}}$."
