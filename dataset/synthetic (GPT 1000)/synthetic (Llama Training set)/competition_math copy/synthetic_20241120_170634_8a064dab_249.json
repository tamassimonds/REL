I'll start by brainstorming how to approach the problem, considering different methods, and adjusting my strategy as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about finding the degree of the polynomial \\( g(x) \\) given that \\( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \\), with the following details:\n\n- Degree of \\( h(x) \\) is \\( 6 \\)\n- Degree of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( 2 \\)\n  \n**Initial Ideas:**\n\n1. **Composition of Functions:** Since \\( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \\), the degree of \\( h(x) \\) likely depends on both \\( f \\) and \\( g \\). I recall that the degree of a composition can be tricky, especially with addition involved.\n\n2. **Properties of Degrees:** I know that the degree of a sum of polynomials is the maximum degree of the individual polynomials. Maybe I can use that here.\n\n3. **Substituting Degrees:** Perhaps substituting the known degrees into an equation could work.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure which approach will be the most straightforward. Let's explore these ideas and see where they lead.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Analyzing the Composition and Sum Separately**\n\n- **Thought:** Break down \\( h(x) \\) into \\( f(g(x)) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) separately to see how each contributes to the overall degree.\n\n- **Potential Steps:**\n  - Determine the degree of \\( f(g(x)) \\).\n  - Determine the degree of \\( g(x) \\).\n  - Find the maximum of these two degrees since the degree of a sum is the highest degree term.\n\n**Reflection:** This makes sense because the degree of \\( h(x) \\) should be influenced by both components. But I need to ensure that adding them doesn't change the highest degree.\n\n**Strategy 2: Using Polynomial Composition Degree Rules**\n\n- **Thought:** Recall that the degree of the composition \\( f(g(x)) \\) is the degree of \\( f \\) multiplied by the degree of \\( g \\). Since \\( f \\) has degree 2, maybe I can use this relationship.\n\n- **Potential Steps:**\n  - Let \\( \\text{deg}(g) = n \\).\n  - Then, \\( \\text{deg}(f(g(x))) = 2 \\times n \\).\n  - Since \\( h(x) \\) has degree 6, set up an equation accordingly.\n\n**Reflection:** This approach assumes that \\( 2n \\) is the highest degree, but I'm not sure because \\( g(x) \\) itself contributes. I might need to adjust this.\n\n**Strategy 3: Checking with a Sample Degree**\n\n- **Thought:** Maybe assume \\( \\text{deg}(g) = n \\) and see if plugging values makes sense.\n\n- **Potential Steps:**\n  - Suppose \\( n = 3 \\), then \\( \\text{deg}(f(g(x))) = 6 \\).\n  - But \\( g(x) \\) also has degree 3, so perhaps both contribute equally.\n\n**Reflection:** This might lead to contradictions. Let's hold off on this until the other strategies are clearer.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Strategy 1: Analyzing Components Separately**\n\nLet's start with the first strategy, as it seems the most logical: analyzing the degrees of \\( f(g(x)) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) separately.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Degree of \\( g(x) \\)**\n\n- Let\u2019s denote \\( \\text{deg}(g) = n \\).\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\n\nBefore proceeding, I realize that I need more information about how the degrees interact. Specifically, I recall that when adding polynomials, the highest degree term from either polynomial dominates. But what's the relationship between \\( n \\) and the given degree of \\( h(x) \\)?\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n\nHmm, if \\( g(x) \\) has degree \\( n \\), and \\( f(g(x)) \\) has degree \\( 2n \\), then the higher degree should be the maximum of \\( 2n \\) and \\( n \\). But, since \\( h(x) \\) has degree 6, this means:\n\n\\[\n\\max(2n, n) = 6\n\\]\n\nDoes this make sense? Let's explore.\n\n**Step 2: Setting Up the Equation**\n\nBased on the above, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\max(2n, n) = 6\n\\]\n\nThis implies that either \\( 2n = 6 \\) or \\( n = 6 \\).\n\n**Calculating \\( n \\):**\n\n1. **Case 1:** \\( 2n = 6 \\)\n   - Solving for \\( n \\): \\( n = 3 \\)\n\n2. **Case 2:** \\( n = 6 \\)\n   - But if \\( n = 6 \\), then \\( \\text{deg}(f(g(x))) = 12 \\), which doesn\u2019t make sense because \\( h(x) \\) has degree 6.\n\n**Check:** Wait, so the only viable solution is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this align with the given information? If \\( \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\), then:\n\n- \\( \\text{deg}(f(g(x))) = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\)\n- \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) = 3 \\)\n\nAnd since \\( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \\), the highest degree term would be the maximum of these, which is indeed 6.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis makes sense. The degree of \\( g(x) \\) is \\( 3 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Approach**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- If \\( \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\), then:\n  - \\( \\text{deg}(f(g(x))) = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\)\n  - \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) = 3 \\)\n  - \\( \\max(6, 3) = 6 \\)\n\nThis matches the given degree of \\( h(x) \\), so the calculation seems correct.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**\n\nI initially considered setting up an equation involving the degrees of \\( f \\) and \\( g \\), but analyzing the components separately provided a clearer path.\n\n**Alternative Strategy Check:**\n\nUsing a sample degree for \\( g(x) \\) could have led to confusion, as assuming \\( \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\) directly aligns with the given information.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and reflecting at each step, the most straightforward approach was to analyze the degrees of \\( f(g(x)) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) separately. This led to determining that the degree of \\( g(x) \\) is \\( 3 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the Process:**\n\n1. **Brainstorming:** Started by considering different ways to relate the degrees of \\( f \\), \\( g \\), and \\( h \\).\n\n2. **Strategy Exploration:** Attempted analyzing components separately and checking with sample degrees.\n\n3. **Reflection and Adjustments:** Realized that setting up a max function was key and adjusted the approach accordingly.\n\n4. **Calculation and Verification:** Calculated \\( \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\) and verified that it satisfies the degree of \\( h(x) = 6 \\).\n\n5. **Final Check:** Confirmed that all components align, leading to the conclusion that \\( \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\).\n\nBy thinking through each step, checking for consistency, and being willing to change strategies, I arrived at the correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "$f(g(x))$ must have a degree of 6, because it will produce the term with the greatest exponent of the polynomial. Because $f(x)$ is a degree 2 polynomial, we can write that $f(x)=bx^2+cx+d$. The term with the greatest exponent in $f(g(x))$ comes from taking $bx^2$ or $b(g(x))^2$. Let $g(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x^{1}+a_0$. Then, the highest degree term of $f(g(x))$ is $b(a_nx^n)^2$, which equals $ba_{n}^2x^{2n}$. Since the degree of $h$ is 6, we have $2n=6$, so $n=3$.  Therefore, the degree of $g$ is $\\boxed{3}$."
