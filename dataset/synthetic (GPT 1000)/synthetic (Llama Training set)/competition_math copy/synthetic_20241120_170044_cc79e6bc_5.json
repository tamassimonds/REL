    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it step by step, just like how I would tackle it if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to ensure I'm on the right track, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- The question asks how many integers \\( n \\) exist such that \\( 3 \\leq n \\leq 10 \\) and \\( 121_n \\) (the number 121 in base \\( n \\)) is a perfect square.\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a base conversion problem combined with checking for perfect squares. It's similar to problems where you need to evaluate numbers in different bases and see their properties.\n- **Confusion:** I'm not entirely sure how to relate the base \\( n \\) representation to perfect squares immediately. Maybe writing out a few examples could help.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Convert \\( 121_n \\) to Decimal:**\n   - Convert the number \\( 121 \\) from base \\( n \\) to decimal (base 10) to see what the actual number is.\n   - Then, check if this decimal number is a perfect square.\n\n2. **Check Perfect Squares Directly:**\n   - Since we're looking for perfect squares, maybe list the perfect squares within the range of possible decimal values and see which bases yield these.\n\n3. **Algebraic Approach:**\n   - Set up an equation based on the definition of perfect squares and see if it leads to a solvable equation for \\( n \\).\n\n**Reflection:** Converting \\( 121_n \\) to decimal seems like a straightforward starting point. If that doesn't lead anywhere, I can explore the other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Converting \\( 121_n \\) to Decimal**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To understand what \\( 121_n \\) means, recall that in base \\( n \\):\n  \\[\n  121_n = 1 \\cdot n^2 + 2 \\cdot n^1 + 1 \\cdot n^0\n  \\]\n- So, in decimal:\n  \\[\n  121_n = n^2 + 2n + 1\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Let's express this explicitly:\n  \\[\n  121_n = n^2 + 2n + 1 = n^2 + 2n + 1\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Wait, does this make sense? Yes, this is the standard way to convert a number from base \\( n \\) to decimal. So, I'm confident this step is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Perfect Square Condition**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The problem states that \\( 121_n \\) should be a perfect square. So, we need:\n  \\[\n  n^2 + 2n + 1 = k^2 \\quad \\text{for some integer } k\n  \\]\n- **Realization:** This resembles the equation of a perfect square trinomial. In fact, \\( n^2 + 2n + 1 = (n + 1)^2 \\). But let\u2019s explore it more formally to ensure we cover all bases.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Is it always a perfect square if \\( n \\) is an integer? Let's see if \\( (n + 1)^2 \\) fits the condition naturally for all \\( n \\) in our range.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying \\( (n + 1)^2 \\) is a Perfect Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- From the previous step, if \\( n^2 + 2n + 1 = (n + 1)^2 \\), then \\( 121_n \\) is always a perfect square because squaring any integer yields a perfect square.\n- **Implication:** Does this mean **all** bases \\( n \\) within the range \\( 3 \\leq n \\leq 10 \\) satisfy the condition? This seems too broad, so I need to verify.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Moment of Doubt:** Wait, can it be that simple? Perhaps \\( (n + 1)^2 \\) doesn't cover all cases. Maybe there are other perfect squares that \\( n^2 + 2n + 1 \\) could equal besides \\( (n + 1)^2 \\).\n- **Realization:** To be thorough, let's also consider other perfect squares \\( k^2 \\) where \\( k \\geq 1 \\), not just \\( n + 1 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Other Perfect Squares Beyond \\( (n + 1)^2 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let\u2019s set up the equation:\n  \\[\n  n^2 + 2n + 1 = k^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n^2 + 2n + 1 - k^2 = 0\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  n^2 + 2n + (1 - k^2) = 0\n  \\]\n- This is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( n \\). For \\( n \\) to be an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square:\n  \\[\n  D = b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (1 - k^2) = 4 - 4(1 - k^2) = 4k^2\n  \\]\n- **Implication:** The discriminant \\( D = 4k^2 \\) is always a perfect square because it's the square of \\( 2k \\). This means that \\( n \\) will always have integer solutions for any integer \\( k \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Verification:** Does this mean every base \\( n \\) in the range will work? It seems so because the quadratic formula will yield integer solutions for \\( n \\).\n- **Check:** However, I recall that not all bases might yield a valid number system (e.g., base must be >1). So, I need to ensure \\( n \\) is within the specified range and valid base.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Listing Possible Bases and Checking**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Given the range \\( 3 \\leq n \\leq 10 \\), let's list each base and see if \\( 121_n \\) is a perfect square in decimal.\n- **Plan:** Calculate \\( n^2 + 2n + 1 \\) for each \\( n \\) and check if the result is a perfect square.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **\\( n = 3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   3^2 + 2 \\times 3 + 1 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16 = 4^2 \\quad \\text{(Perfect square)}\n   \\]\n2. **\\( n = 4 \\):**\n   \\[\n   4^2 + 2 \\times 4 + 1 = 16 + 8 + 1 = 25 = 5^2 \\quad \\text{(Perfect square)}\n   \\]\n3. **\\( n = 5 \\):**\n   \\[\n   5^2 + 2 \\times 5 + 1 = 25 + 10 + 1 = 36 = 6^2 \\quad \\text{(Perfect square)}\n   \\]\n4. **\\( n = 6 \\):**\n   \\[\n   6^2 + 2 \\times 6 + 1 = 36 + 12 + 1 = 49 = 7^2 \\quad \\text{(Perfect square)}\n   \\]\n5. **\\( n = 7 \\):**\n   \\[\n   7^2 + 2 \\times 7 + 1 = 49 + 14 + 1 = 64 = 8^2 \\quad \\text{(Perfect square)}\n   \\]\n6. **\\( n = 8 \\):**\n   \\[\n   8^2 + 2 \\times 8 + 1 = 64 + 16 + 1 = 81 = 9^2 \\quad \\text{(Perfect square)}\n   \\]\n7. **\\( n = 9 \\):**\n   \\[\n   9^2 + 2 \\times 9 + 1 = 81 + 18 + 1 = 100 = 10^2 \\quad \\text{(Perfect square)}\n   \\]\n8. **\\( n = 10 \\):**\n   \\[\n   10^2 + 2 \\times 10 + 1 = 100 + 20 + 1 = 121 = 11^2 \\quad \\text{(Perfect square)}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** All bases from \\( 3 \\) to \\( 10 \\) yield perfect squares when \\( 121_n \\) is converted to decimal. This confirms that the condition is satisfied for every integer \\( n \\) in the specified range.\n- **Moment of Realization:** So, it turns out that \\( n^2 + 2n + 1 \\) is always a perfect square for any integer \\( n \\), specifically \\( (n + 1)^2 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Initially, I considered the possibility of \\( n^2 + 2n + 1 \\) being equal to different perfect squares, but then realized that it always equals \\( (n + 1)^2 \\).\n- This simplification led me to conclude that every base \\( n \\) within the range automatically satisfies the perfect square condition.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Double-Check:** Does this conclusion hold universally within the given range? Yes, because the conversion formula is consistent and aligns with perfect squares.\n- **Realization:** By recognizing that \\( n^2 + 2n + 1 \\) simplifies to \\( (n + 1)^2 \\), the solution became straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Number of Valid Integers \\( n \\):** There are **8** integers \\( n \\) within the range \\( 3 \\leq n \\leq 10 \\) such that \\( 121_n \\) is a perfect square.\n- **Final Answer:** \\( n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \\)\n\n---\n\n### **Mistakes and Corrections**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Initially, I thought about exploring beyond \\( (n + 1)^2 \\), considering other perfect squares \\( k^2 \\). However, upon calculating, I realized that \\( n^2 + 2n + 1 \\) always equals \\( (n + 1)^2 \\), simplifying the problem significantly.\n- **Mistake:** Overcomplicating the problem by considering multiple perfect squares when only one (namely \\( (n + 1)^2 \\)) was applicable.\n- **Correction:** By simplifying the equation to \\( (n + 1)^2 \\), the solution became much more straightforward.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- It's important to look for patterns and simplifications in problems like these. Recognizing that \\( n^2 + 2n + 1 \\) always equals \\( (n + 1)^2 \\) was key to quickly solving the problem.\n- Always double-check your initial assumptions. What might seem complex at first can often be simplified by observing underlying relationships, as was the case here.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Output**\n\nThere are **8** integers \\( n \\) within the range \\( 3 \\leq n \\leq 10 \\) such that \\( 121_n \\) is a perfect square. Specifically, \\( n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \\).",
