I'll walk through my thought process step by step, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking my work as we go. It's important to think out loud, exploring various approaches, acknowledging mistakes, and adjusting strategies as needed\u2014just like a human solving a problem would.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we have a triangle \\( XYZ \\) with:\n\n- \\( \\angle X = 90^\\circ \\) (which means triangle \\( XYZ \\) is a right triangle)\n- \\( \\tan Z = 3 \\)\n\nWe need to find \\( \\cos Z \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Right Triangle Basics:** Since \\( \\angle X = 90^\\circ \\), \\( Z \\) must be one of the other two angles. In right triangles, the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.\n  \n- **Given \\(\\tan Z = 3\\):** This suggests that the ratio of the lengths of the sides opposite and adjacent to \\( \\angle Z \\) is 3. So, if I let the length of the side opposite \\( Z \\) be 3 units, the adjacent side would be 1 unit.\n\n- **Finding \\( \\cos Z \\):** Knowing the lengths of the sides relative to \\( \\angle Z \\), I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse and then compute \\( \\cos Z \\) as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.\n\nBut wait, let me think\u2014is there another way to approach this? Maybe using trigonometric identities or the unit circle. However, since we're dealing with a right triangle and have the tangent value, the side ratio method seems straightforward. \n\n**Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Side Length Ratios:**\n   - Assign specific lengths to the sides based on the tangent ratio.\n   \n2. **Trigonometric Identities:**\n   - Use the identity \\( \\tan Z = \\frac{\\sin Z}{\\cos Z} \\) to relate sine and cosine.\n   \n3. **Unit Circle Concept:**\n   - Use the unit circle approach where \\( \\tan Z \\) is the ratio of the y-coordinate to the x-coordinate.\n\nGiven that the side length ratio method is direct and clear, I'll start with that. If it doesn't pan out, I can try the other methods.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Assign Side Lengths Based on \\(\\tan Z = 3\\)**\n\nReflecting on the given \\(\\tan Z = 3\\):\n- \\(\\tan Z = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = 3\\)\n- Let's assign: \n  - Opposite side to \\( Z \\): 3 units\n  - Adjacent side to \\( Z \\): 1 unit\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because \\(\\tan Z = \\frac{3}{1} = 3\\), which matches the given information.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to Find the Hypotenuse**\n\nWe know in a right triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{hypotenuse}^2 = (\\text{opposite})^2 + (\\text{adjacent})^2\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{hypotenuse}^2 = 3^2 + 1^2 = 9 + 1 = 10\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{hypotenuse} = \\sqrt{10}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Calculating \\( \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.16 \\). Does this seem reasonable? Yes, the hypotenuse should be longer than both legs, and \\( \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.16 \\) makes sense.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate \\( \\cos Z \\)**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\n\\cos Z = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\cos Z = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Does the ratio \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} \\) look correct? Yes, because the adjacent side is 1 unit, and the hypotenuse is \\( \\sqrt{10} \\), so the cosine value reflects the ratio correctly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Rationalize the Denominator (Optional)**\n\nSometimes, it's preferred to express the answer with a rational denominator. Let's do that:\n\n\\[\n\\cos Z = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{10} \\) a valid simplification? Yes, this is commonly done to present the cosine value in a more standard form.\n\n---\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Using Trigonometric Identities**\n\nNow, reflecting on whether my initial approach is the only way, I think about using trigonometric identities. Specifically, the identity involving \\( \\tan Z \\) could help verify our answer.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\tan Z = \\frac{\\sin Z}{\\cos Z} = 3\n\\]\n\nFrom our earlier calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\cos Z = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} = 0.316\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s see if this holds true with the identity:\n\n\\[\n\\tan Z = \\frac{\\sin Z}{\\cos Z} \\Rightarrow \\sin Z = \\tan Z \\cdot \\cos Z\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( \\sin Z \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin Z = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{10}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's verify using the Pythagorean identity:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 Z + \\cos^2 Z = 1\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{10}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{90}{100} + \\frac{1}{10} = 0.9 + 0.1 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Does this satisfy the identity? Yes, \\( \\sin^2 Z + \\cos^2 Z = 1 \\), which confirms our calculations are correct.\n\n**Reflection:** Both strategies converge to the same result, reinforcing the correctness of the solution. Using trigonometric identities serves as a verification step, ensuring no errors were made in the initial approach.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\cos Z = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\cos Z = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{10} \\approx 0.316\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:** Does \\( \\cos Z = 0.316 \\) make sense in the context of the problem? Yes, it's a valid cosine value for an angle in a right triangle, especially since \\( Z \\) is less than \\( 90^\\circ \\) (given \\( \\tan Z > 1 \\)).\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, applying the Pythagorean theorem, and verifying with trigonometric identities, we've confidently determined that \\( \\cos Z = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} \\). Checking each step ensured the accuracy of the solution, mirroring a human problem-solving process with reflections, adjustments, and validations along the way.",
