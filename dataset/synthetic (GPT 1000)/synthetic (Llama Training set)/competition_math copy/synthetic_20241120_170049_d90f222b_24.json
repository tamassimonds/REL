    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were working through it myself. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, exploring each one, reflecting on its validity, and adjusting my approach as needed. I'll make sure to think out loud, check my work frequently, and not shy away from making mistakes along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem:\n\n**User Query:** Find the roots of \\(6x^4 + 19x^3 - 51x^2 + 20x\\). Enter your answer as a list of numbers separated by commas.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Degree of the Polynomial:** It's a quartic polynomial (\\(x^4\\)), which makes me think that finding the roots might require factoring or using the Rational Root Theorem.\n  \n- **Presence of \\(x\\) in All Terms:** I notice that every term includes \\(x\\), which suggests that \\(x = 0\\) might be a root. This could simplify things.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF).**\n  2. **Use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots.**\n  3. **Attempt polynomial long division or synthetic division.**\n  4. **Apply Ferrari\u2019s Method or another quartic-solving formula if necessary.**\n\nOkay, let's explore these strategies one by one, starting with factoring out the GCF since that seems the most straightforward. If that doesn't work, I'll move on to the next strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Factor Out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Identifying the GCF:** Looking at the coefficients and \\(x\\) in each term, I see that each term has \\(x\\), and the coefficients are 6, 19, -51, and 20.\n  \n- **Factoring \\(x\\) Out:** Let's try factoring \\(x\\) out of the entire polynomial:\n  \n  \\[\n  6x^4 + 19x^3 - 51x^2 + 20x = x(6x^3 + 19x^2 - 51x + 20)\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Help?** Yes, factoring out \\(x\\) simplifies the problem by reducing the degree of the polynomial by 1. Now we need to find the roots of the cubic polynomial \\(6x^3 + 19x^2 - 51x + 20\\).\n\n- **Next Steps:** I\u2019ll proceed to find the roots of the cubic polynomial using the Rational Root Theorem.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Is \\(x = 0\\) a Root?** By factoring out \\(x\\), we've confirmed that \\(x = 0\\) is indeed a root.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Apply the Rational Root Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Understanding the Theorem:** The Rational Root Theorem states that possible rational roots of a polynomial are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient.\n\n- **Identifying Possible Rational Roots:**\n  - **Constant Term:** \\(20\\) \u2014 Factors are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b15, \u00b110, \u00b120\n  - **Leading Coefficient:** \\(6\\) \u2014 Factors are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b16\n  - **Possible Rational Roots:** \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b15, \u00b110, \u00b120 divided by \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b16\n\n- **Simplifying Possible Roots:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Possible roots} = \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b14, \u00b15, \u00b110, \u00b120\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Too Many Possibilities:** There are quite a few possible rational roots to test. To make it easier, I might start testing smaller numbers first.\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Instead of testing all possible roots, maybe I can look for patterns or use synthetic division to streamline the process.\n\n- **Decision:** I'll start by testing \u00b11, \u00b12, and \u00b14, as these are smaller and easier to compute.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Wait:** Before proceeding, let me consider whether it's efficient to test all these roots. Perhaps factoring further or using synthetic division might save time.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Testing Possible Rational Roots**\n\n#### **First Test: \\(x = 1\\)**\n\n- **Substitute \\(x = 1\\) into the Cubic Polynomial:**\n\n  \\[\n  6(1)^3 + 19(1)^2 - 51(1) + 20 = 6 + 19 - 51 + 20 = -6\n  \\]\n  \n- **Result:** \\(x = 1\\) is **not** a root because the result is not zero.\n\n#### **Second Test: \\(x = -1\\)**\n\n- **Substitute \\(x = -1\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  6(-1)^3 + 19(-1)^2 - 51(-1) + 20 = -6 + 19 + 51 + 20 = 84\n  \\]\n  \n- **Result:** \\(x = -1\\) is **not** a root.\n\n#### **Third Test: \\(x = 2\\)**\n\n- **Substitute \\(x = 2\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  6(2)^3 + 19(2)^2 - 51(2) + 20 = 48 + 76 - 102 + 20 = 42\n  \\]\n  \n- **Result:** \\(x = 2\\) is **not** a root.\n\n#### **Fourth Test: \\(x = -2\\)**\n\n- **Substitute \\(x = -2\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  6(-2)^3 + 19(-2)^2 - 51(-2) + 20 = -48 + 76 + 102 + 20 = 150\n  \\]\n  \n- **Result:** \\(x = -2\\) is **not** a root.\n\n#### **Fifth Test: \\(x = 4\\)**\n\n- **Substitute \\(x = 4\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  6(4)^3 + 19(4)^2 - 51(4) + 20 = 384 + 304 - 204 + 20 = 504\n  \\]\n  \n- **Result:** \\(x = 4\\) is **not** a root.\n\n#### **Sixth Test: \\(x = -4\\)**\n\n- **Substitute \\(x = -4\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  6(-4)^3 + 19(-4)^2 - 51(-4) + 20 = -384 + 304 + 204 + 20 = 144\n  \\]\n  \n- **Result:** \\(x = -4\\) is **not** a root.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Skepticism:** None of the small integers are roots. This is unusual, especially since \\(x = 0\\) was already identified as a root.\n\n- **Possible Misstep:** Maybe I miscalculated. Let me quickly double-check one of the earlier calculations.\n\n- **Checking \\(x = 2\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  6(2)^3 + 19(2)^2 - 51(2) + 20 = 48 + 76 - 102 + 20 = 42\n  \\]\n  \n  - **Wait:** The calculations seem correct. But since \\(x = 2\\) doesn't work, perhaps there's another issue.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\n- **Suggestion:** Since testing rational roots hasn't worked so far, maybe it's time to consider synthetic division or factoring further to see if there's a simpler way to find the remaining roots.\n\n- **Decision:** Let's try synthetic division with one of the roots we've confirmed, \\(x = 0\\), to see if that simplifies the cubic polynomial further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Perform Synthetic Division with \\(x = 0\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Purpose of Synthetic Division:** To divide the polynomial by \\(x - r\\), where \\(r\\) is a root. Since \\(x = 0\\) is a root, dividing by \\(x\\) should simplify the polynomial.\n\n- **Setting Up Synthetic Division:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{6x^4 + 19x^3 - 51x^2 + 20x}{x} = 6x^3 + 19x^2 - 51x + 20\n  \\]\n  \n- **Resulting Polynomial:** \\(6x^3 + 19x^2 - 51x + 20\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Help?** Yes, synthetic division confirms that \\(x = 0\\) is a root and simplifies the polynomial to a cubic equation.\n\n- **Next Steps:** Now, I need to find the roots of the cubic polynomial \\(6x^3 + 19x^2 - 51x + 20\\). Since testing rational roots directly hasn't been successful, maybe I can use factoring techniques or the Rational Root Theorem again.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Wait:** Before proceeding, let me consider if there's a better way to approach this. Perhaps factoring by grouping or looking for other factoring patterns might help.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Attempt Factoring by Grouping**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Looking for Patterns:** Factoring by grouping involves splitting the polynomial into parts that can be factored separately.\n\n- **Applying to the Cubic Polynomial:**\n\n  \\[\n  6x^3 + 19x^2 - 51x + 20 = (6x^3 + 19x^2) + (-51x + 20)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Factoring Each Group:**\n\n  - **First Group:** \\(6x^2(x + \\frac{19}{6})\\)\n  - **Second Group:** \\(-51(x - \\frac{20}{51})\\)\n  \n- **Resulting Expression:**\n\n  \\[\n  6x^2(x + \\frac{19}{6}) - 51(x - \\frac{20}{51})\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Work?** The terms don't seem to factor nicely, and the fractions complicate things. This doesn't look promising.\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Factoring by grouping doesn't seem effective here. Maybe I should return to the Rational Root Theorem or consider synthetic division with another potential root.\n\n- **Decision:** Let\u2019s apply the Rational Root Theorem again, but this time test different roots or reconsider the factoring approach.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Reminder:** Since \\(x = 0\\) is a root, perhaps there\u2019s another rational root that can help factor the cubic polynomial. Let's revisit the Rational Root Theorem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Reapplying the Rational Root Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Considering Remaining Possible Roots:** Based on previous tests, no small integer roots worked. Maybe I overlooked a root or miscalculated.\n\n- **Let's Test \\(x = -5\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  6(-5)^3 + 19(-5)^2 - 51(-5) + 20 = -750 + 475 + 255 + 20 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Result:** \\(x = -5\\) **is** a root.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Breakthrough:** Finally, I found a rational root, \\(x = -5\\). This indicates that the cubic polynomial can be factored further.\n\n- **Next Steps:** Since \\(x = -5\\) is a root, I can perform synthetic division to factor the cubic polynomial and find the remaining roots.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Wait:** Before proceeding with synthetic division, let me double-check the calculation for \\(x = -5\\).\n\n  \\[\n  6(-5)^3 + 19(-5)^2 - 51(-5) + 20 = -750 + 475 + 255 + 20 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  - **Confirmation:** The result is indeed 0, confirming that \\(x = -5\\) is a root.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Perform Synthetic Division with \\(x = -5\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Dividing the Cubic Polynomial by \\(x + 5\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  6x^3 + 19x^2 - 51x + 20 \\div (x + 5)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Setting Up Synthetic Division:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n  -5 & 6 & 19 & -51 & 20 \\\\\n     &   & -30 & 55 & -20 \\\\\n  \\hline\n     & 6 & -11 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n\n- **Resulting Polynomial:** \\(6x^2 - 11x + 4\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Help?** Yes, synthetic division by \\(x + 5\\) simplifies the cubic polynomial to a quadratic equation.\n\n- **Next Steps:** Now, I need to find the roots of the quadratic polynomial \\(6x^2 - 11x + 4\\). This can be done using the quadratic formula.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Wait:** Before applying the quadratic formula, let me verify the synthetic division steps.\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n  -5 & 6 & 19 & -51 & 20 \\\\\n     &   & -30 & 55 & -20 \\\\\n  \\hline\n     & 6 & -11 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n  \\end{array}\n  \\]\n  \n  - **Confirmation:** The division steps are correct, and the resulting polynomial is \\(6x^2 - 11x + 4\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Solving the Quadratic Equation Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Quadratic Formula:** The roots of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) are given by:\n  \n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Applying to Our Quadratic Polynomial:**\n  \n  \\[\n  a = 6, \\quad b = -11, \\quad c = 4\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{(-11)^2 - 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4}}{2 \\cdot 6}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{121 - 96}}{12}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{12}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  = \\frac{11 \\pm 5}{12}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **New Roots:** Along with the previously found root \\(x = -5\\), the quadratic equation gives two more roots: \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x = \\frac{4}{3}\\).\n\n- **Total Roots:** Now, including the root from the cubic polynomial, we have three roots: \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = -5\\), \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(x = \\frac{4}{3}\\).\n\n- **Polynomial Degree vs. Number of Roots:** Wait a minute! I initially started with a quartic polynomial, but after synthetic division by two roots (\\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = -5\\)), I ended up with a quadratic polynomial, which means I should have three roots total. Since \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = -5\\) are already counted, the remaining roots \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(x = \\frac{4}{3}\\) are correct.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Verification:** Let\u2019s verify that all four roots satisfy the original polynomial.\n\n  - **Root \\(x = 0\\):**\n    \n    \\[\n    6(0)^4 + 19(0)^3 - 51(0)^2 + 20(0) = 0\n    \\]\n    \n  - **Root \\(x = -5\\):**\n    \n    \\[\n    6(-5)^4 + 19(-5)^3 - 51(-5)^2 + 20(-5) = 0\n    \\]\n    \n    (Calculation confirms \\(0\\))\n    \n  - **Root \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\):**\n    \n    \\[\n    6\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 + 19\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 - 51\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + 20\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 0\n    \\]\n    \n    (Calculation confirms \\(0\\))\n    \n  - **Root \\(x = \\frac{4}{3}\\):**\n    \n    \\[\n    6\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^4 + 19\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^3 - 51\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 + 20\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) = 0\n    \\]\n    \n    (Calculation confirms \\(0\\))\n    \n- **Confirmation:** All four roots satisfy the original polynomial, so our solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe roots of the polynomial \\(6x^4 + 19x^3 - 51x^2 + 20x\\) are:\n\n\\[\n0, -5, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:** Initially, I considered factoring out the GCF, applying the Rational Root Theorem, and testing possible rational roots. Factoring out \\(x\\) simplified the problem, leading me to the cubic polynomial.\n\n- **Exploring Different Approaches:** After testing several rational roots without success, I found \\(x = -5\\) as a root, which guided me to perform synthetic division and reduce the cubic polynomial to a quadratic one.\n\n- **Checking Work:** Throughout the process, I verified each step, ensuring that synthetic division was correct and that the quadratic formula was applied accurately.\n\n- **Adjusting Strategies:** When initial tests didn't yield roots, I reconsidered my approach and persisted until I identified \\(x = -5\\) as a root, which unlocked the solution.\n\n- **Aha Moments:** Recognizing that \\(x = 0\\) was a root from the start helped simplify the problem. Finding \\(x = -5\\) as a rational root was crucial in factoring the cubic polynomial.\n\n- **Final Verification:** Before concluding, I checked that all identified roots satisfy the original polynomial, confirming the accuracy of the solution.\n\nBy following this detailed and reflective process, I've successfully found all roots of the given polynomial.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the polynomial has no constant term, we can immediately factor out an $x$ from every term\n$$x(6x^3+19x^2-51x+20),$$and our first root $x=0$. Let $g(x) = 6x^3+19x^2-51x+20$. Then the remaining roots of our original polynomial are the roots of $g(x)$. By trying out simple values, we can see that $g(0) = 20 > 0$ and $g(1) = 6+19-51+20 = -6<0$. Thus, there must be a root of $g(x)$ between $0$ and $1$. From the Rational Root Theorem, we know that if $g(p/q) = 0$ then $p$ must divide $20$ and $q$ must divide $6$.\n\nChecking rational numbers of the form $p/q$, where $p$ divides $20$ and $q$ divides $6$, and $p/q$ is between $0$ and $1$, we find that\n$$\\begin{aligned} g\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) &= 6\\cdot\\frac{1}{8}+19\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}-51\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}+20 = 0.\n\\end{aligned}$$This means that $2x - 1$ is a factor of $g(x).$ Dividing by $2x-1$ gives us $g(x) = (2x-1)(3x^2+11x-20)$.\n\nThe quadratic $3x^2+11x-20$ factors as $(3x-4)(x+5),$ so our last two roots are $4/3$ and $-5$.\n\nThus, the roots of $6x^4+19x^3-51x^2+20x$ are $\\boxed{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{4}{3}, -5}$."
