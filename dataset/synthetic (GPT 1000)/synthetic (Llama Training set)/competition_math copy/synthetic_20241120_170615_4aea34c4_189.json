I'll tackle it step-by-step, reflecting and checking my work as I go, just like thinking through a human-like approach.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**Given:**  \n\\( f(x) = x + 3 \\)   \n\\( g(x) = 3x + 5 \\)   \n\n**Objective:**  \nFind \\( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) \\)\n\nWait a minute... This looks like evaluating composite functions and then finding the difference. Composite functions are kind of like functions within functions, right? Hmm, I think I've tackled something similar before, but it's been a while. Let me brainstorm some strategies to approach this.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Evaluate Each Function Step-by-Step:**\n   - Compute \\( g(4) \\) first.\n   - Then find \\( f(g(4)) \\).\n   - Similarly, compute \\( f(4) \\), then \\( g(f(4)) \\).\n   - Finally, subtract the two results.\n\n2. **Check if Simplifying First Helps:**\n   - Maybe simplify \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) before plugging in values?\n   - But looking at it, they seem pretty straightforward.\n\n3. **Look for Patterns or Properties:**\n   - Are \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) linear functions? \n   - Do they have any interesting relationships?\n\nAt this point, the first strategy seems the most direct: evaluating each function step by step. The second strategy doesn't seem necessary since the functions are simple. The third strategy might help if I notice something unusual, but let's start with the concrete steps.\n\nAlright, let's proceed with **Strategy 1**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Compute \\( g(4) \\)**\n\n**Thinking:**  \nAlright, I need to evaluate \\( g(4) \\). The function \\( g(x) \\) is defined as \\( 3x + 5 \\). So, I'll plug 4 into that.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\ng(4) = 3(4) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, \\( g(4) = 17 \\). That seems straightforward. No errors here. Let me carry on.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Compute \\( f(g(4)) = f(17) \\)**\n\n**Thinking:**  \nNext, I need to find \\( f(17) \\). The function \\( f(x) \\) is \\( x + 3 \\). So, I'll substitute 17 into that.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\nf(17) = 17 + 3 = 20\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGot it. \\( f(17) = 20 \\). Everything checks out so far. No inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Compute \\( f(4) \\)**\n\n**Thinking:**  \nNow, I need to find \\( f(4) \\) as part of the second part of the expression. Easy enough \u2013 just use the definition of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\nf(4) = 4 + 3 = 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAlright, \\( f(4) = 7 \\). That was simple. I think I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Compute \\( g(f(4)) = g(7) \\)**\n\n**Thinking:**  \nNow, I need to evaluate \\( g(7) \\). Let's use the definition of \\( g(x) \\) again.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\ng(7) = 3(7) + 5 = 21 + 5 = 26\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, \\( g(7) = 26 \\). Everything seems to align. No errors so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Compute \\( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) = 20 - 26 \\)**\n\n**Thinking:**  \nFinally, I need to subtract the two results: \\( f(g(4)) - g(f(4)) = 20 - 26 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n20 - 26 = -6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute... \\( 20 - 26 = -6 \\)? That seems a bit unexpected because both functions are positive transformations. But mathematically, it checks out. **Let me double-check my steps leading here.**\n\nGoing back:\n\n- \\( g(4) = 17 \\)\n- \\( f(17) = 20 \\)\n- \\( f(4) = 7 \\)\n- \\( g(7) = 26 \\)\n\nAll these steps look correct. So, **the negative result is valid**.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Simplifying Before Evaluating**\n\n**Thinking:**  \nMaybe there's another way to approach this by finding a relationship between \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\). Both are linear functions, and perhaps composing them could simplify things.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- Could I express \\( f(g(x)) \\) or \\( g(f(x)) \\) in a simplified form?\n- Maybe find \\( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) \\) in general?\n\n**Exploring:**  \nLet's see if composing the functions helps:\n\n1. Compute \\( f(g(x)) \\):\n\n   \\[\n   g(x) = 3x + 5\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   f(g(x)) = f(3x + 5) = (3x + 5) + 3 = 3x + 8\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute \\( g(f(x)) \\):\n\n   \\[\n   f(x) = x + 3\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   g(f(x)) = g(x + 3) = 3(x + 3) + 5 = 3x + 9 + 5 = 3x + 14\n   \\]\n\n3. Compute \\( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) \\):\n\n   \\[\n   f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = (3x + 8) - (3x + 14) = 3x + 8 - 3x - 14 = 8 - 14 = -6\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, **both methods** lead to the same result: \\( -6 \\). This confirms that our initial step-by-step approach was correct. It's nice to see the consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure everything aligns:\n\n- **Direct Method:**\n  - \\( g(4) = 17 \\)\n  - \\( f(17) = 20 \\)\n  - \\( f(4) = 7 \\)\n  - \\( g(7) = 26 \\)\n  - \\( 20 - 26 = -6 \\)\n\n- **Alternative Method:**\n  - \\( f(g(x)) = 3x + 8 \\)\n  - \\( g(f(x)) = 3x + 14 \\)\n  - \\( f(g(x)) - g(f(x)) = -6 \\)\n\nBoth approaches yield the same result, reinforcing that the answer is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{-6} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, I began with a straightforward evaluation of each function step-by-step. Initially, I computed \\( g(4) \\) and then proceeded to find \\( f(g(4)) \\). Similarly, I evaluated \\( f(4) \\) and followed it with \\( g(f(4)) \\). Subtracting these results gave me \\( -6 \\).\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I also considered composing the functions to see if a general simplification would work, which confirmed the initial result. Checking each step consistently helped catch any potential errors, and reflecting throughout the process ensured a clear path to the correct solution. \n\n**Reflection:**  \nThinking through both methods highlighted the importance of verifying results through multiple approaches. This not only confirms the correctness but also deepens understanding by showing that different strategies can lead to the same outcome.",
