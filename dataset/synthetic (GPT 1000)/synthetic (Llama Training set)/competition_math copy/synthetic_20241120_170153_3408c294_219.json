    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, thinking through it just like I would if I were solving it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and be willing to change my approach if something doesn't seem right. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I see that we're dealing with a \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) that transforms another \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) by:\n\n1. **Swapping the first and second rows** of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\).\n2. **Doubling the third row** of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\).\n\nThe goal is to find the matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) that accomplishes this.\n\nHonestly, my initial reaction is that this reminds me of matrix row operations, which are commonly used in linear algebra for tasks like row echelon form or Gaussian elimination. But here, it's about defining a matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) that, when multiplied by another matrix \\(\\mathbf{N}\\), performs these specific row transformations.\n\nI'm thinking it might be related to how elementary matrices work\u2014perhaps \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) is an elementary matrix that applies these row operations.\n\nBut then again, I'm not entirely sure if that's the right path. Maybe I should explore a few different strategies to see which one fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use Elementary Matrices:**\n   - **Idea:** Define \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) as an elementary matrix that represents the combined operations of swapping the first and second rows and doubling the third row.\n\n2. **Apply Row Operations Directly:**\n   - **Idea:** Write down the effect of \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) on a general matrix \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) and see how the matrix multiplication unfolds.\n\n3. **Leverage Identity Matrix Modifications:**\n   - **Idea:** Start with the identity matrix and modify it to achieve the desired row operations, as each row operation corresponds to a specific modification in the identity matrix.\n\nLooking at these options, the **Elementary Matrices** approach seems promising because it's a standard method to represent row operations algebraically. However, I'm still a bit unsure if this will directly lead me to \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) without any additional steps.\n\nMaybe **applying row operations directly** could give me more insight into how \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) should be structured. Let's try that first and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Attempting Strategy 2: Applying Row Operations Directly**\n\nLet\u2019s take a generic \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{N}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{N} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nI want to see how \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) transforms \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) to achieve the desired result:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{N} = \\begin{pmatrix} d & e & f \\\\ a & b & c \\\\ 2g & 2h & 2i \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) transforms the rows of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) in this specific way, then each row of \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) must interact with the corresponding column of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) to produce the desired row in the result.\n- This suggests that \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) has to be structured in a way that only certain elements of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) contribute to specific rows in the product \\(\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{N}\\).\n\n**First Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? I\u2019m thinking that \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) needs to selectively pick elements from \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) and possibly scale them (like doubling the third row). \n\nBut I still need a clearer path to define \\(\\mathbf{M}\\). Let me sketch a rough idea:\n\n- The **first row** of \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) should result in the first row of the product being the second row of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) (\\(d, e, f\\)).\n- The **second row** of \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) should result in the second row of the product being the first row of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) (\\(a, b, c\\)).\n- The **third row** of \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) should double the third row of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) (\\(2g, 2h, 2i\\)).\n\nThis is starting to look like a permutation with scaling. Hmm, let me see if I can arrange \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) accordingly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI\u2019m still not entirely sure how to represent the row swaps and scaling in matrix form. Maybe visualizing the effect on the identity matrix could help.\n\n---\n\n### **Second Strategy: Leveraging Identity Matrix Modifications**\n\nLet\u2019s consider how row operations are represented using identity matrices. Each row operation can be represented by multiplying the identity matrix by a specific matrix that embodies that operation.\n\n**Idea:**\n\n- **Row Swap:** Swapping the first and second rows can be represented by a permutation matrix.\n- **Row Scaling:** Doubling the third row can be represented by a diagonal matrix.\n\nI can combine these two ideas to form \\(\\mathbf{M}\\). But I need to ensure that applying \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) produces the correct transformations.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Row Swap Matrix**\n\nA row swap matrix for swapping the first and second rows in a \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{P} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, multiplying \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) by \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) will swap the first and second rows.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Row Scaling Matrix**\n\nA diagonal matrix that doubles the elements of the third row is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis looks correct. Multiplying \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) by \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) will leave the first and second rows unchanged and double the third row.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Matrices**\n\nTo apply both operations sequentially, \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) should be their product:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{P} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait a moment. Is this right? Let's verify by applying \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{N}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{N} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} d & e & f \\\\ a & b & c \\\\ 2g & 2h & 2i \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems to work perfectly! The first row of \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) takes the second row of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\), the second row of \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) takes the first row of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\), and the third row of \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) doubles the third row of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nLet\u2019s verify that \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) indeed performs the desired row transformations on any \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{N}\\).\n\n**Test with a Sample Matrix:**\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{N} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 8 & 9 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nApplying \\(\\mathbf{M}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{N} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 8 & 9 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 14 & 16 & 18 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Result:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 14 & 16 & 18 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\n- The **first row** of the result (\\(4, 5, 6\\)) is the **second row** of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\), swapped as intended.\n- The **second row** of the result (\\(1, 2, 3\\)) is the **first row** of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\), also swapped as intended.\n- The **third row** of the result (\\(14, 16, 18\\)) is the **third row** of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) doubled, which aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out! The matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) correctly implements the row swapping and scaling operations on \\(\\mathbf{N}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nInitially, I wasn't sure how to represent the combined row operations in matrix form. By exploring different strategies\u2014starting with direct application of row operations and then leveraging identity matrix modifications\u2014I arrived at defining \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) as a product of a permutation matrix and a diagonal matrix.\n\nThis approach worked effectively, and by testing with a sample matrix, I confirmed that \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) behaves as intended. Throughout the process, reflecting and verifying each step ensured that the solution was correct and aligned with the problem's requirements. \n\nIn the end, embracing a trial-and-error mindset and being open to adjusting strategies led me to the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) that transforms \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) by swapping its first and second rows and doubling its third row is:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nBy applying this matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) to any \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{N}\\), the desired row transformations are achieved.",
