The subscript \"10\" indicates that the number is in decimal (base 10), and I need to convert it to base 5.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Reflection:** This reminds me of converting numbers between different bases, something I've done with binary (base 2) or hexadecimal (base 16) before. I recall that base conversion often involves division and remainders.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Repeated Division Method:** Divide the number by 5 repeatedly and keep track of the remainders. This is how I remember converting to binary.\n  2. **Subtraction Method:** Subtract the largest power of 5 that fits into the number and record the coefficient.\n  3. **Place Value Approach:** Think in terms of base 5 place values like units, fives, twenty-fives, etc.\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** The repeated division method seems familiar and straightforward. Let me try that first.\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Repeated Division Method\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI'll divide \\( 1357 \\) by \\( 5 \\) and keep track of the remainders. The base 5 number is formed by these remainders, read in reverse order.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **First Division:**\n   \\[\n   1357 \\div 5 = 271 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 2\n   \\]\n   So, \\( 1357 = 5 \\times 271 + 2 \\).\n\n2. **Second Division:**\n   \\[\n   271 \\div 5 = 54 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 1\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( 271 = 5 \\times 54 + 1 \\).\n\n3. **Third Division:**\n   \\[\n   54 \\div 5 = 10 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 4\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( 54 = 5 \\times 10 + 4 \\).\n\n4. **Fourth Division:**\n   \\[\n   10 \\div 5 = 2 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\( 10 = 5 \\times 2 + 0 \\).\n\n5. **Fifth Division:**\n   \\[\n   2 \\div 5 = 0 \\quad \\text{Remainder: } 2\n   \\]\n   Finally, \\( 2 = 5 \\times 0 + 2 \\).\n\n**Collecting the Remainders:**\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \\( 20412_5 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Checking the Work\n\n**Quick Reflection:**\n\nLet me double-check if this makes sense. Each remainder corresponds to a digit in base 5, and reading them in reverse should give the correct base 5 representation.\n\n**Deeper Check:**\n\nIs \\( 20412_5 \\) equivalent to \\( 1357_{10} \\)?\n\n- **Calculating \\( 20412_5 \\) in Decimal:**\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 5^4 + 0 \\times 5^3 + 4 \\times 5^2 + 1 \\times 5^1 + 2 \\times 5^0\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 2 \\times 625 + 0 \\times 125 + 4 \\times 25 + 1 \\times 5 + 2 \\times 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 1250 + 0 + 100 + 5 + 2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 1357\n  \\]\n\n**Conclusion of Check:**\n\nYes, \\( 20412_5 \\) is indeed \\( 1357_{10} \\) when converted back to decimal. The conversion seems correct.\n\n### Step 4: Exploring Alternative Strategies\n\n**Wait a Moment:**\n\nIs there another way to verify this? Perhaps using the subtraction method.\n\n**Thinking:**\n\n- **Subtraction Method:** I can subtract the largest powers of 5 from \\( 1357 \\) and record how many times each power fits.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Largest Power of 5 Less Than 1357:**\n   \\[\n   5^4 = 625 \\quad (\\text{Fits } 1357 \\div 625 = 2 \\text{ times})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1357 - 2 \\times 625 = 107\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Power:**\n   \\[\n   5^2 = 25 \\quad (\\text{Fits } 107 \\div 25 = 4 \\text{ times})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   107 - 4 \\times 25 = 7\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Power:**\n   \\[\n   5^1 = 5 \\quad (\\text{Fits } 7 \\div 5 = 1 \\text{ time})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   7 - 1 \\times 5 = 2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Last Power:**\n   \\[\n   5^0 = 1 \\quad (\\text{Fits } 2 \\div 1 = 2 \\text{ times})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2 - 2 \\times 1 = 0\n   \\]\n\n**Forming the Base 5 Number:**\n\nReading the coefficients from highest to lowest power:\n\\[\n2 \\times 5^4 + 0 \\times 5^3 + 4 \\times 5^2 + 1 \\times 5^1 + 2 \\times 5^0 = 20412_5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth methods yield the same result: \\( 20412_5 \\). This reinforces the correctness of the conversion.\n\n### Step 5: Final Check and Consolidation\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Consistency:** Both the repeated division method and the subtraction method agree on the base 5 representation.\n- **Verification:** Converting \\( 20412_5 \\) back to decimal confirms it equals \\( 1357_{10} \\).\n- **Confidence Level:** I'm confident that \\( 20412_5 \\) is the correct base 5 representation of \\( 1357_{10} \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n1357_{10} = 20412_5\n\\]\n\n### Summary\n\nBy exploring different strategies\u2014beginning with the repeated division method and verifying with the subtraction method\u2014I ensured the accuracy of the base conversion. Reflection and multiple checks confirmed that \\( 1357_{10} \\) converts to \\( 20412_5 \\). This step-by-step approach, including brainstorming, calculating, and verifying, led to a reliable solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We see that the largest power of 5 that is less than 1357 is $5^4=625$, and the largest multiple of 625 less than 1357 is 1250, or $2\\cdot625$. From here, we find that the largest power of five less than $1357-1250=107$ is $5^2=25$, and the largest multiple of 25 less than 107 is 100, or $4\\cdot25$. Next, the largest power of five that is less than $107-100=7$ is $5^1=5$, simply giving us 5 or $1\\cdot 5$ as the largest multiple of 5. Finally, this leaves us with $7-5=2$, or $2\\cdot1=2\\cdot5^0$. Therefore, we can express 1357 as $2\\cdot5^4+0\\cdot5^3+4\\cdot5^2+1\\cdot5^1+2\\cdot5^0$, which gives us $\\boxed{20412_5}$."
