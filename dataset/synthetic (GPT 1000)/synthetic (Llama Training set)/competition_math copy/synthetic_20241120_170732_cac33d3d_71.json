I'll brainstorm different strategies, explore each step thoroughly, reflect on whether I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it by hand.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:  \n**\"For what real values of \\( a \\) is the expression \\( \\frac{a+3}{a^2-4} \\) undefined?\"**  \nI think, \"This looks familiar\u2014it's about finding when a rational expression is undefined. I remember that usually involves the denominator.\" But honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to start right away. So let's explore.\n\nPossible strategies that come to mind:\n\n1. **Setting the Denominator to Zero:** Often, expressions are undefined where their denominators equal zero.  \n2. **Factoring the Denominator:** Maybe factoring could help identify the problematic values more clearly.  \n3. **Graphical Approach:** Looking at a graph to see where the function might be undefined.  \n4. **Using Calculus:** Though perhaps overkill, checking for singularities considering limits.\n\nI think starting with the **first strategy\u2014setting the denominator to zero\u2014**makes the most sense and is the most straightforward. Let's go with that and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting the Denominator to Zero**\n\nThought Process:  \nOkay, I need to find out when the denominator \\( a^2 - 4 \\) equals zero because that\u2019s where the expression \\( \\frac{a+3}{a^2-4} \\) would be undefined.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\na^2 - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis equation reminds me of a difference of squares. I recall that:\n\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\n\\]\n\nSo here, \\( b^2 = 4 \\) or \\( b = 2 \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\na^2 - 4 = (a - 2)(a + 2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, does this make sense? Yes, because if either \\( a - 2 = 0 \\) or \\( a + 2 = 0 \\), then \\( a^2 - 4 = 0 \\). So, solving these:\n\n\\[\na - 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = 2\n\\]\n\\[\na + 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = -2\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nSo, the values \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( a = -2 \\) make the denominator zero. That aligns with what I expect\u2014rational expressions are typically undefined at values that nullify the denominator. But let's double-check by considering a different strategy to ensure this is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Double-Checking by Factoring the Denominator**\n\nThought Process:  \nLet me see if factoring the denominator again confirms these values or if I missed something. Maybe there's another approach I can use to validate.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nRevisiting the denominator:\n\n\\[\na^2 - 4 = (a - 2)(a + 2)\n\\]\n\nSo, setting each factor to zero gives:\n\n\\[\na - 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = 2\n\\]\n\\[\na + 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = -2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, this matches the previous step. Therefore, both strategies point to \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( a = -2 \\) as the values making the expression undefined. It\u2019s reinforcing that the approach is correct.\n\n**Check:**  \nSince both methods align, I feel confident about these values. But let's explore one more strategy\u2014graphing\u2014to visualize and ensure there are no other hidden issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Graphical Approach**\n\nThought Process:  \nMaybe looking at the graph of the function \\( f(a) = \\frac{a+3}{a^2-4} \\) will help me see where it's undefined. Visualizing can sometimes reveal things that algebraic methods might miss.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHowever, I realize that graphing isn't always feasible without tools, and since I\u2019m doing this step-by-step by hand, it might not be practical. But I\u2019ll keep it in mind as a backup.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**  \nWait, instead of plotting the entire function, perhaps I can think about the characteristics of rational functions. They are typically undefined at their vertical asymptotes, which correspond to the zeros of the denominator. Since we've already identified \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( a = -2 \\) as zeros, it seems aligned with what the graph would show\u2014vertical asymptotes at these points.\n\n**Check:**  \nThis makes sense. The graph would likely have vertical asymptotes at \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( a = -2 \\), confirming that the function is undefined at these values. So, even without plotting, I'm confident that \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( a = -2 \\) are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout these steps, I started by setting the denominator to zero, which is the most direct approach. I then double-checked by factoring the denominator, which confirmed the same values. Lastly, considering a graphical approach helped validate that there are no additional hidden issues.\n\n**Check:**  \nAll methods point to the same conclusion: the expression \\( \\frac{a+3}{a^2-4} \\) is undefined at \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( a = -2 \\). I feel confident about this answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe expression \\( \\frac{a+3}{a^2-4} \\) is **undefined** at \\( a = -2, 2 \\).",
