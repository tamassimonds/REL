    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, complete with brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting the approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{t^2 - t - 56}{t - 8} = \\frac{3}{t + 5}\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \n- **Fractional Equation:** This reminds me of solving equations with fractions by cross-multiplying or finding a common denominator.\n- **Polynomial in Numerator:** The numerator \\(t^2 - t - 56\\) looks like a quadratic, which might factor nicely.\n- **Potential Simplification:** Maybe I can simplify the left side before cross-multiplying.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Factor the Numerator:** See if \\(t^2 - t - 56\\) factors easily. If it does, maybe I can simplify the fraction.\n2. **Cross-Multiply:** After simplifying, cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions.\n3. **Common Denominator:** Alternatively, bring both sides to a common denominator to simplify.\n\nLet me start by trying to factor the numerator. If that doesn't work well, I'll consider the other options.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Factor the Numerator**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf \\(t^2 - t - 56\\) factors nicely, I might be able to simplify the left side fraction by canceling out \\(t - 8\\).\n\n**Factoring Attempt:**  \n- Looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-56\\) and add up to \\(-1\\) (the coefficient of \\(t\\)).\n- Possible pairs: \\((7, -8)\\) and \\((-7, 8)\\).\n\n**Checking:**\n\\[\n7 \\times (-8) = -56 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 7 + (-8) = -1\n\\]\n**Realization:**  \nThis works! So, the numerator factors to:\n\\[\nt^2 - t - 56 = (t - 8)(t + 7)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute, the denominator is also \\(t - 8\\). This suggests a possible simplification.\n\n**Thought:**  \nMaybe I can simplify the left side by canceling \\(t - 8\\), but I need to be careful about the domain\u2014\\(t\\) cannot be \\(8\\) because that would make the denominator zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Left Side**\n\n**Action:**  \nCancel \\(t - 8\\) from the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(t - 8)(t + 7)}{t - 8} = t + 7 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t \\neq 8\n\\]\n\n**Simplified Equation:**\n\\[\nt + 7 = \\frac{3}{t + 5}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n- Does this make sense? Yes, as long as \\(t \\neq 8\\), the simplification is valid.\n\n**Thought:**  \nNow, I have a much simpler equation to work with. Let\u2019s move forward by getting rid of the fraction.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Cross-Multiplying to Eliminate the Fraction**\n\n**Action:**  \nCross-multiply to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\n(t + 7)(t + 5) = 3\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- This should give me a quadratic equation that I can solve for \\(t\\).\n- Let\u2019s expand the left side.\n\n**Expansion:**\n\\[\nt^2 + 5t + 7t + 35 = 3\n\\]\n\\[\nt^2 + 12t + 35 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLooks good so far. Now, let's move 3 to the left side to set the equation to zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Setting the Quadratic Equation to Zero**\n\n**Action:**  \nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nt^2 + 12t + 35 - 3 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nt^2 + 12t + 32 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- This is a standard quadratic equation. I can try to factor it again.\n- Alternatively, I could use the quadratic formula if factoring seems tricky.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nLet\u2019s see if it factors easily. Looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(32\\) and add up to \\(12\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Attempting to Factor the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Factoring Attempt:**  \n- Possible pairs for \\(32\\): \\((1, 32), (2, 16), (4, 8)\\).\n- Looking for a pair that sums to \\(12\\): \\((4, 8)\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\\[\n4 \\times 8 = 32 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 4 + 8 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Factored Equation:**\n\\[\n(t + 4)(t + 8) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGreat! The quadratic factors nicely. Now, let\u2019s solve for \\(t\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Solving for \\(t\\)**\n\n**Action:**  \nSet each factor equal to zero:\n\n\\[\nt + 4 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t = -4\n\\]\n\\[\nt + 8 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t = -8\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- I have two possible solutions: \\(t = -4\\) and \\(t = -8\\).\n- But I need to check if these work in the original equation and ensure they don\u2019t violate any conditions (like making a denominator zero).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNeither \\(t = -4\\) nor \\(t = -8\\) makes the original denominators zero, so both are valid solutions.\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, the problem asks for the **greatest** value of \\(t\\). That means I need to consider both solutions and pick the larger one.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Identifying the Greatest Value**\n\n**Action:**  \nCompare the two solutions:\n\n\\[\nt = -4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t = -8\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe greatest value of \\(t\\) that satisfies the equation is **\\(t = -4\\)**.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDoes this make sense? Let\u2019s do a quick check by substituting \\(t = -4\\) back into the original equation to see if it holds true.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Check:**  \nSubstitute \\(t = -4\\) into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(-4)^2 - (-4) - 56}{-4 - 8} = \\frac{3}{-4 + 5}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n**Left Side:**\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4 - 56}{-12} = \\frac{-36}{-12} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Right Side:**\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{1} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Comparison:**  \nBoth sides are equal: \\(3 = 3\\). Thus, \\(t = -4\\) is indeed a valid solution.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nPerfect! The solution checks out. Now, just to be sure, let\u2019s quickly verify the other solution \\(t = -8\\).\n\n**Quick Check for \\(t = -8\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(-8)^2 - (-8) - 56}{-8 - 8} = \\frac{3}{-8 + 5}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n**Left Side:**\n\\[\n\\frac{64 + 8 - 56}{-16} = \\frac{16}{-16} = -1\n\\]\n\n**Right Side:**\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{-3} = -1\n\\]\n\n**Comparison:**  \nBoth sides are equal: \\(-1 = -1\\). So, \\(t = -8\\) is also a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n- **Multiple Solutions:** I found two solutions: \\(t = -4\\) and \\(t = -8\\).\n- **Greatest Value:** The problem specifically asks for the greatest value, so \\(t = -4\\) is the answer.\n- **Verification:** Both solutions satisfy the original equation, confirming their validity.\n- **Thought Process:** Starting with factoring helped simplify the problem early on, making it easier to solve. Cross-multiplying was a natural next step to eliminate the fractions, leading to a straightforward quadratic equation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-4}\n\\]\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy brainstorming different strategies, attempting to factor the numerator, and simplifying the equation step by step, I arrived at the greatest value of \\(t\\) as \\(-4\\). Throughout the process, I reflected, checked my work, and adjusted my approach as needed, ensuring a thorough and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We could cross-multiply, but that doesn't look like much fun.  Instead, we first factor the quadratic, which gives us  \\[\\frac{(t-8)(t+7)}{t-8} = \\frac{3}{t+5}.\\]Canceling the common factor on the left gives  \\[t+7 = \\frac{3}{t+5}.\\]Multiplying both sides by $t+5$ gives us $(t+7)(t+5) = 3$.   Expanding the product on the left gives $t^2 + 12t + 35 = 3$, and rearranging this equation gives $t^2 +12 t + 32 = 0$.  Factoring gives $(t+4)(t+8) = 0$, which has solutions $t=-4$ and $t=-8$.  The greatest of these solutions is $\\boxed{-4}$."
