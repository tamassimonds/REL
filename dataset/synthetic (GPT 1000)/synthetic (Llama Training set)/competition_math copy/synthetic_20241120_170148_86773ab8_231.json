    "working_out": "### Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\nOkay, looking at the problem, I see it's about calculating the probability of rain over a weekend, specifically on **at least one of the two days** (Saturday or Sunday). The probabilities given are:\n\n- **Saturday:** 40% chance of rain\n- **Sunday:** 50% chance of rain\n\nAlso, it's mentioned that these probabilities are **independent**. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Independence implies that the outcome of rain on Saturday doesn't affect Sunday and vice versa. That's useful.\n- I remember from probability that calculating the chance of **at least one event happening** can often be easier by using the **complementary probability**\u2014that is, calculating the probability of **none of the events happening** and subtracting from 1.\n  \n  > **But wait**, let's explore a few strategies to make sure this is the best approach. Maybe there's another way I'm not considering.\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Calculating Directly Using Addition:**\n   - I could try adding the probabilities of rain on both days since they're independent.\n   - **But**, adding them directly might overestimate because it doesn't consider the overlap (rain on both days).\n\n2. **Using the Complementary Probability:**\n   - This seems like a solid approach. Calculate the probability of no rain on both days and subtract from 1.\n\n3. **Creating a Probability Tree:**\n   - I could draw a tree diagram showing all possible weather outcomes over the two days.\n   - This might be more visual but could get messy with calculations.\n\n4. **Applying the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**\n   - Maybe use this to account for the overlap, but since we're dealing with two independent events, it might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait**, the Probability Tree approach might take too long and isn't necessary here.\n- **Hmm**, the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle isn't needed because the events are independent.\n- **Looks like** the best and simplest method is to **use the complementary probability**.\n\n### Step 1: Probability of No Rain on Both Days\n\nLet's go with the **complementary probability** method. First, I'll calculate the probability that it **doesn't rain** on both Saturday and Sunday.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Probability it **doesn't rain on Saturday:**  \n  \\[ 100\\% - 40\\% = 60\\% \\]\n\n- Probability it **doesn't rain on Sunday:**  \n  \\[ 100\\% - 50\\% = 50\\% \\]\n\n- Since the two days are independent, the probability that it **doesn't rain on both days** is:  \n  \\[\n  60\\% \\times 50\\% = 30\\%\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Hmm**, 30% seems reasonable. It's a low chance that it won't rain at all over the weekend.\n\n### Step 2: Probability of Rain on At Least One Day\n\nNow, to find the probability that it **rains on at least one day**, I'll subtract the probability of no rain on both days from 1.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n1 - 30\\% = 70\\%\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Oh!** That makes sense. There's a 70% chance that it rains at least once over the weekend.\n- **Let me think:** Does this align with my initial expectation? A 70% probability feels plausible given the independent daily chances.\n\n### Step 3: Verifying the Approach\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does this number make sense?** Given both days have a decent chance of rain, 70% seems logical.\n- **Is there another method that would give a different answer?** Not really, since we've accounted for both independent probabilities correctly.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait,** am I confident that multiplying the non-rain probabilities was the right step? Yes, because independence allows that multiplication.\n- **Hmm,** could there be a mistake in the percentages? Double-checking the calculations:  \n  \\(60\\% \\times 50\\% = 30\\%\\)  \n  \\(1 - 30\\% = 70\\%\\)  \n  **Yup, it's correct.**\n\n### Alternative Approach: Direct Probability Addition (Corrected)\n\n**Thinking About the Alternative Approach:**\n\n- Initially, I considered adding the probabilities directly:  \n  \\[\n  40\\% + 50\\% = 90\\%\n  \\]\n  \n- **But wait**, this results in 90%, which seems too high. What happened here?\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Let me think:** Adding the probabilities of both days assumes mutual exclusivity (that rain on one day excludes it on the other), which isn't true because they are **independent**.\n- **So,** this method doesn't work because it doesn't account for the overlap where it rains on both days.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Looks like** the complementary probability method is indeed the correct and most straightforward approach.\n- **Adding probabilities** directly isn't valid here due to the independence of events.\n\n### Recap and Final Answer\n\n**Recap of Steps:**\n\n1. **Calculated the probability of no rain on both days:**  \n   \\(60\\% \\times 50\\% = 30\\%\\)\n\n2. **Subtracted from 1 to find the probability of rain on at least one day:**  \n   \\(1 - 30\\% = 70\\%\\)\n\n3. **Verified the approach and checked calculations:**  \n   Everything aligns correctly.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{70\\%}\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Ahh, I see now** that using the complementary probability was the best strategy all along.\n- **Initially**, I thought about several methods, but checking each one confirmed that complementing the probability of no rain was the most efficient.\n- **Throughout**, being open to exploring different strategies and reflecting on their validity helped ensure accuracy.\n- **In the end**, the probability that it rains over the weekend is **70%**.",
