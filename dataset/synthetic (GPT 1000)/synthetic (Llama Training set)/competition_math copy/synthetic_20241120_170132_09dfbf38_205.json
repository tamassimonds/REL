    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle this problem just like I would if I were solving it on paper, thinking out loud and exploring different strategies. I'll start by brainstorming how to approach it, reflecting on the methods, checking my work frequently, and being open to changing strategies if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, here's the problem:\n\n\\[ x^3 + (x + 1)^3 + (x + 2)^3 = (x + 3)^3 \\]\n\nWhen I first look at this, it resembles an equation involving cubic terms. Cubes remind me of the **Binomial Theorem**, or maybe I should think about **factoring cubics**. But then again, having multiple cubes and their sums equals another cube looks a bit unusual.\n\nI **recall** that there are identity traits for cubes, like \\( a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) \\), but here we have three terms added together. Maybe I could **expand** each term using the Binomial Theorem and see where that leads me. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or simplification I can spot by evaluating specific values of \\( x \\).\n\nLet me **brainstorm** a bit:\n\n- **Expand each term**: This will give me a polynomial, but it might get messy.\n- **Look for symmetry or patterns**: Maybe there's a clever way to simplify without expanding completely.\n- **Check specific values**: Testing with some integers could give me hints about the solutions.\n- **Factorization techniques**: Once expanded, see if there's a common factor or maybe use synthetic division if a root is guessed.\n\nHmm, I'm leaning towards **expanding** first to see the structure of the equation, but I'll keep an eye out for patterns or simplifications. If it gets too cumbersome, I might switch strategies.\n\n### **Step 1: Expanding Each Side**\n\nLet's start by expanding each cube to see what the equation looks like.\n\n**Left Side:**\n\n1. \\( x^3 \\) - that\u2019s straightforward.\n2. \\( (x + 1)^3 \\): Expanding using the Binomial Theorem:\n   \\[\n   (x + 1)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1\n   \\]\n3. \\( (x + 2)^3 \\): Similarly,\n   \\[\n   (x + 2)^3 = x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8\n   \\]\n4. **Total Left Side:**\n   \\[\n   x^3 + (x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1) + (x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8) = 3x^3 + 9x^2 + 15x + 9\n   \\]\n\n**Right Side:**\n\n1. \\( (x + 3)^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   (x + 3)^3 = x^3 + 9x^2 + 27x + 27\n   \\]\n\n**New Equation:**\n\n\\[\n3x^3 + 9x^2 + 15x + 9 = x^3 + 9x^2 + 27x + 27\n\\]\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Equation**\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation by bringing all terms to one side.\n\n\\[\n3x^3 + 9x^2 + 15x + 9 - (x^3 + 9x^2 + 27x + 27) = 0\n\\]\n\nSubtract term by term:\n\n\\[\n(3x^3 - x^3) + (9x^2 - 9x^2) + (15x - 27x) + (9 - 27) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2x^3 - 12x - 18 = 0\n\\]\n\n### **Step 3: Factoring the Polynomial**\n\nNow I have:\n\n\\[\n2x^3 - 12x - 18 = 0\n\\]\n\nFirst, **factor out the greatest common factor (GCF):**\n\n\\[\n2(x^3 - 6x - 9) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 6x - 9 = 0\n\\]\n\n### **Step 4: Finding Roots Using Rational Root Theorem**\n\nNow, let's try to find the roots of the cubic equation \\( x^3 - 6x - 9 = 0 \\) using the **Rational Root Theorem**. According to this theorem, possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient.\n\n**Possible rational roots:**\n\n- Factors of -9: \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b19\n- Since the leading coefficient is 1, we consider these as possible roots.\n\nLet me **test** these possible roots:\n\n1. **Test \\( x = 1 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   1^3 - 6(1) - 9 = 1 - 6 - 9 = -14 \\quad (\\text{Not a root})\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Test \\( x = -1 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   (-1)^3 - 6(-1) - 9 = -1 + 6 - 9 = -4 \\quad (\\text{Not a root})\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Test \\( x = 3 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   3^3 - 6(3) - 9 = 27 - 18 - 9 = 0 \\quad (\\text{Actually, this is a root})\n   \\]\n   \n   Wait a minute, \\( x = 3 \\) works! This is promising. It seems I found a root.\n\n### **Step 5: Factoring the Cubic Polynomial Using the Found Root**\n\nSince \\( x = 3 \\) is a root, I can factor the cubic polynomial. Let's perform **synthetic division** to divide \\( x^3 - 6x - 9 \\) by \\( x - 3 \\).\n\n**Synthetic Division:**\n\n```\n     3 |  1   0   -6   -9\n       |      3    9    9\n       --------------------\n         1   3    3    0\n```\n\nSo, the result is:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 3x + 3\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 6x - 9 = (x - 3)(x^2 + 3x + 3)\n\\]\n\n### **Step 6: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\nNow, set the quadratic factor to zero to find the other roots:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 3x + 3 = 0\n\\]\n\nLet's use the **quadratic formula**:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 3 \\), and \\( c = 3 \\).\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(1)(3)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 12}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince the discriminant is negative (\\( -3 \\)), the roots are **complex**:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-3 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\n### **Step 7: Collecting All Solutions**\n\nSo, the solutions to the original equation are:\n\n\\[\nx = 3, \\quad x = \\frac{-3 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\quad x = \\frac{-3 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut the problem asks for **all real solutions**, so we only consider the real root:\n\n\\[\nx = 3\n\\]\n\n### **Step 8: Reflecting and Checking the Work**\n\nLet's **double-check** our work to ensure everything makes sense:\n\n- **Did I correctly expand the cubes?** Yes, the expansions were straightforward.\n- **Was the simplification correct?** Subtracting term by term led to the correct polynomial.\n- **Did synthetic division work correctly?** Yes, dividing by \\( x - 3 \\) gave a correct quadratic factor.\n- **Are the other roots complex?** Yes, the quadratic formula yielded complex roots, which aligns with the expectation since cubic equations can have one real root and two complex roots.\n\nEverything seems to add up, and the only real solution is \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe only real solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nBy following this step-by-step approach, exploring different strategies, and continuously reflecting on the correctness of each step, I arrived at the solution methodically. This mirrors how I would naturally solve the problem on paper, ensuring accuracy through multiple checks.",
