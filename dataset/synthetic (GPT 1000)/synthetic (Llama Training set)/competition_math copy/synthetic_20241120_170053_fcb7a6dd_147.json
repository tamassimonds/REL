    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would when tackling a real-life problem, exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed. Here we go.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, my immediate reaction is, **\"This looks like a percentage and capacity problem I've seen before.\"** It reminds me of those problems where you deal with parts of a whole, like percentages of a tank being full or empty. \n\n**But wait, I'm not entirely sure how to set it up right away.** Let me think it through a bit more:\n\n- **Percentage Concepts:** The tank is described as being 30% full and 20% empty. So, that means it\u2019s 70% full, right? Wait, is that helpful here?\n- **Comparison of States:** We're comparing two states: 30% full and 80% full (since 20% is empty, leaving 80% full). The problem involves these two conditions being different by 27 gallons.\n- **Total Capacity:** Ultimately, we need to find out the total capacity of the tank when it's full. \n\n**Thinking out loud:** **\"Okay, maybe I can set up an equation based on these percentages and the difference in gallons.\"** But I'm not sure how to start. \n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Variable Approach:** Assign a variable to the total capacity and set up equations based on the given percentages.\n2. **Percentage Equations:** Use percentage expressions to relate the different states.\n3. **Direct Comparison:** Directly compare the two states using the given difference in gallons.\n\n**Thinking again:** **\"The variable approach seems straightforward, but let me think if there\u2019s a quicker way.\"** I remember that setting up a proportion might work too. **But for now, let's start with assigning a variable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Assigning a Variable**\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total capacity of the tank as \\( C \\) gallons.\n\n**Thought Process:** **\"By assigning \\( C \\), I can express the different states in terms of \\( C \\), which might help set up the equation.\"**\n\n**Equation Setup:**\n\n- **30% Full:** When the tank is 30% full, it contains \\( 0.30C \\) gallons.\n- **20% Empty:** When the tank is 20% empty, it's 80% full, so it contains \\( 0.80C \\) gallons.\n\n**Difference Given:**\n\nThe difference between these two states is 27 gallons:\n\n\\[\n0.80C - 0.30C = 27\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**\n\n\\[\n0.50C = 27\n\\]\n\n**Checking:** **\"Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me think if I\u2019ve set it up correctly.\"** The difference of 50% of \\( C \\) should equal 27 gallons, which makes sense because 80% full minus 30% full leaves 50% capacity difference.\n\n**Reflection:** **\"I think this setup is correct because it directly relates the given difference to the total capacity.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving for \\( C \\)**\n\nNow, let's solve the equation to find \\( C \\).\n\n\\[\n0.50C = 27\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** **\"I need to isolate \\( C \\) to find the total capacity. Let me divide both sides by 0.50.\"**\n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{27}{0.50} = 54\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{27}{0.50} = 27 \\times 2 = 54\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** **\"Okay, multiplying by 2 makes sense because dividing by 0.50 is the same as finding half, and doubling 27 gives 54.\"** \n\n**Quick Check:** **\"Does 54 seem reasonable? Let me verify by plugging it back into the original conditions.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Let\u2019s plug \\( C = 54 \\) back into the percentage conditions to ensure it satisfies the problem.**\n\n1. **30% Full:**\n   \\[\n   0.30 \\times 54 = 16.2 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **20% Empty (80% Full):**\n   \\[\n   0.80 \\times 54 = 43.2 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Difference:**\n   \\[\n   43.2 - 16.2 = 27 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n**Thought Process:** **\"The difference is exactly 27 gallons, which matches the problem's condition.\"**\n\n**Reflection:** **\"It looks like the solution is correct because all conditions are satisfied.\"**\n\n**Checking Again:** **\"Let me think if any other approach could have worked or if this is the most efficient.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Given that the variable approach worked, I\u2019m considering if there are other methods I could have used:**\n\n1. **Proportion Method:** Setting up proportions based on the percentages could also lead to the same equation.\n2. **Unit Conversion:** Converting percentages to fractions and using those to set up the relationship.\n\n**Thinking:** **\"But since assigning a variable straightforwardly led me to the solution, and verifying it confirmed its correctness, I think this is the best approach here.\"**\n\n**Final Check:** **\"Everything aligns with the problem's conditions, so I\u2019m confident in the answer.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**After brainstorming and exploring different strategies, I concluded that assigning a variable to represent the tank's total capacity was the most effective method. Solving the resulting equation gave me \\( C = 54 \\) gallons.**\n\n**Throughout the process, I checked my work by verifying the solution against the problem's conditions, ensuring that the answer makes sense. Alternating strategies and reflecting on each step helped confirm the accuracy of the solution.**\n\n**Final Answer: The tank holds **54 gallons** when full.**",

  "ground_truth": "$20\\%$ empty is the same thing as $80\\%$ full.  Thus, 27 gallons represents the difference between $80\\%$ and $30\\%$ of the tank, meaning that 27 gallons is $50\\%$ of the tank.  Since half the tank is 27 gallons, the entire tank can hold $\\boxed{54\\text{ gallons}}$."
