    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking through each part as naturally as possible\u2014just like I would when tackling a problem for the first time. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question **\"Find the probability that \\( abc = 1 \\) when three standard dice are tossed,\"** my immediate reaction is:\n\n- **Doubt:** Wait, can the product of three dice rolls ever be 1?\n- **Recall:** Didn't I learn that the only way a product equals 1 is if all factors are 1 (since 1 is the multiplicative identity)?\n- **Realization:** Oh! But standard dice only have faces numbered from 1 to 6, so maybe it's possible.\n\nThis gives me a hint that **perhaps only specific rolls** on the dice would make \\( abc = 1 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **List Possible Outcomes:**\n   - Calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three dice.\n   - Determine the favorable outcomes where \\( abc = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Examine Possible Values:**\n   - Since each die shows a number between 1 and 6, maybe only certain combinations can multiply to 1.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - Use probability formulas to find the likelihood of the favorable outcomes.\n\n**Initial Thought:** Listing all possible outcomes seems cumbersome, especially with three dice. Maybe there's a more straightforward way by examining the possible values.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the \"Examine Possible Values\" Strategy**\n\nLet's dive into this approach to see if it works.\n\n#### **Step 1: Understanding \\( abc = 1 \\)**\n\n- **Observation:** For \\( abc = 1 \\), each of \\( a, b, c \\) must be 1 because 1 is the only number that, when multiplied by itself and any other number, doesn't change.\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, but isn't there a dice face with 1? Hmm, let me think\u2026 Yes, each die has a face with a 1, so it's possible.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Therefore, all three dice must show a 1 for their product to equal 1.\n\n#### **Step 2: Calculating Favorable Outcomes**\n\n- **Favorable Outcome:** Only one combination works: \\( (a, b, c) = (1, 1, 1) \\).\n\n- **Check:** Is there any other combination? No, because any die showing a number other than 1 would make \\( abc \\neq 1 \\).\n\n- **Thought Process:** Okay, so there's only **one favorable outcome** where \\( abc = 1 \\).\n\n#### **Step 3: Calculating Total Possible Outcomes**\n\n- **Total Outcomes:** Each die has 6 faces, so for three dice: \\( 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216 \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** That number seems right because each die is independent.\n\n#### **Step 4: Probability Calculation**\n\n- **Formula:** Probability \\( P = \\frac{\\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\\text{Total Possible Outcomes}} \\).\n\n- **Calculation:** \n  \\[\n  P = \\frac{1}{216}\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** \n  - **Quick Check:** Only one outcome out of 216 supports \\( abc = 1 \\), which makes sense.\n  - **Deeper Reflection:** This aligns with the logic that all three dice must show 1.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The probability is indeed \\( \\frac{1}{216} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: List Possible Outcomes**\n\nJust to ensure correctness, let's briefly consider another approach:\n\n#### **Step 1: Total Outcomes Confirmation**\n\n- As calculated before, \\( 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216 \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** No issue here.\n\n#### **Step 2: Favorable Outcomes Confirmation**\n\n- Only \\( (1, 1, 1) \\) meets the criterion.\n\n- **Check:** Does any other combination multiply to 1? No, so only one favorable outcome.\n\n#### **Step 3: Probability Calculation Confirmation**\n\n- Same as before: \\( \\frac{1}{216} \\).\n\n- **Thought Process:** Both strategies lead to the same probability, which increases my confidence in the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Reflection**\n\n- **Quick Check:** \n  - Number makes sense: \\( \\frac{1}{216} \\) is a reasonable probability for a rare event.\n\n- **Deeper Reflection:** \n  - Only one specific combination among many possible ones results in \\( abc = 1 \\). This supports the probability being low.\n\n- **Doubt:** Is there any aspect I overlooked? No, after reviewing, it's clear that only \\( (1, 1, 1) \\) satisfies the condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies and confirming through calculations and reflections, the probability that \\( abc = 1 \\) when three standard dice are tossed is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{216}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** By examining the requirement for \\( abc = 1 \\), calculating the total and favorable outcomes, and verifying through different approaches, we've determined that the probability is \\( \\frac{1}{216} \\). Throughout the process, reflecting and checking at each step ensured the correctness of the solution.",
