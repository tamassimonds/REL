    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through it step by step, mimicking a human thought process with brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- The question asks for the number of outfits consisting of one shirt and one pair of pants.\n- It mentions having three shirts and four pairs of pants.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- This seems like a basic combinatorial problem\u2014maybe something about combinations or permutations.\n- I remember dealing with similar problems where I had to multiply the number of choices for each item.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n- Use multiplication to find the total combinations.\n- List all possible outfits to ensure counting is correct.\n- Check if there's a formula or principle that applies, like the fundamental counting principle.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Multiplication seems straightforward since each shirt can pair with each pant.\n- Listing all combinations might be tedious but could help verify the multiplication approach.\n\n**Decision:**\n- I'll start with the multiplication method because it's the simplest and most efficient.\n- If that doesn't seem right, I'll consider listing the outfits as a backup.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Applying the Multiplication Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- For each shirt, there are several pants to choose from.\n- The total number of outfits is the product of the number of shirts and pants.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Number of shirts: \\(3\\)\n- Number of pants: \\(4\\)\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Outfits} = \\text{Number of Shirts} \\times \\text{Number of Pants} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Wait, does multiplying make sense here? Each shirt should pair with each pant, right?\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Yes, that seems logical. Multiplication accounts for all possible combinations.\n\n**Intermediate Insight:**\n- The answer of \\(12\\) feels reasonable because with each shirt having four options, and there are three shirts, the total combinations would naturally be \\(3 \\times 4\\).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Verifying the Calculation by Listing Outfits**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To ensure accuracy, let's list all possible shirt-pant combinations.\n- This will confirm that the multiplication method is correct.\n\n**List of Outfits:**\n1. Shirt 1 + Pant 1\n2. Shirt 1 + Pant 2\n3. Shirt 1 + Pant 3\n4. Shirt 1 + Pant 4\n5. Shirt 2 + Pant 1\n6. Shirt 2 + Pant 2\n7. Shirt 2 + Pant 3\n8. Shirt 2 + Pant 4\n9. Shirt 3 + Pant 1\n10. Shirt 3 + Pant 2\n11. Shirt 3 + Pant 3\n12. Shirt 3 + Pant 4\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Counting the listed outfits gives me \\(12\\), which matches the multiplication result.\n- This confirms that the multiplication approach was correct.\n\n**Intermediate Insight:**\n- Listing the outfits serves as a sanity check, ensuring no combinations are missed or counted multiple times.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Considering an Alternative Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Although the multiplication method worked, I wonder if there's another way to approach this problem.\n- Maybe using combinations or even a visual aid like a matrix could help.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**\n- Create a matrix where one dimension represents shirts and the other represents pants.\n- Each cell in the matrix could represent an outfit combination.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This might be overcomplicating things since multiplication already gave a direct answer.\n- But perhaps visualizing it in a matrix could provide a clearer understanding.\n\n**Decision:**\n- I'll sketch out the matrix idea briefly to see if it adds value.\n\n**Matrix Representation:**\n\n|         | Pant 1     | Pant 2     | Pant 3     | Pant 4     |\n|---------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Shirt 1 | Shirt 1+1  | Shirt 1+2  | Shirt 1+3  | Shirt 1+4  |\n| Shirt 2 | Shirt 2+1  | Shirt 2+2  | Shirt 2+3  | Shirt 2+4  |\n| Shirt 3 | Shirt 3+1  | Shirt 3+2  | Shirt 3+3  | Shirt 3+4  |\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Each cell corresponds to a unique outfit, confirming that there are \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) total outfits.\n- This visual representation aligns with the multiplication method.\n\n**Intermediate Insight:**\n- Using a matrix helps to visualize the combinations, reinforcing the accuracy of the calculated total.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- After exploring different strategies and verifying the calculation through listing and matrix representation, I'm confident in the answer.\n- It's essential to ensure that all possible combinations are accounted for and that no overcounting or undercounting occurs.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- The multiplication method was efficient, and verifying it through listing and matrix ensured its correctness.\n- Alternative strategies, while helpful in visualizing, confirmed that the initial approach was valid.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- There are **12** possible outfits consisting of one shirt and one pair of pants.\n- Multiple strategies can confirm the same result, enhancing confidence in the accuracy of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n- Initially, I considered using combinations or listing to approach the problem, but recognizing it as a basic multiplication scenario was key.\n- Checking the work by listing all outfits was a valuable step to ensure completeness and correctness.\n- Exploring alternative methods, like using a matrix, provided a visual confirmation but wasn't necessary for this straightforward problem.\n- Reflecting and adjusting strategies throughout the process ensured a robust and accurate solution.",
