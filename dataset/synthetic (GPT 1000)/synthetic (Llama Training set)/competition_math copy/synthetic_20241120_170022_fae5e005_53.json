I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on what's working or not, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's take it one thought at a time, checking along the way to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n- **$y$ varies inversely as $\\sqrt{x}$:** This phrase is key. I remember from previous math problems that \"varies inversely\" usually means there's a relationship where one variable increases, and the other decreases. Specifically, it suggests that \\( y \\times \\sqrt{x} = k \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\n- **When \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 4 \\):** This gives us a specific point to work with, so we can determine the constant \\( k \\).\n\n- **What is \\( x \\) when \\( y = 1 \\)?:** This is what we need to find\u2014identify the value of \\( x \\) that makes \\( y \\) equal to 1.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Use the given relationship \\( y \\times \\sqrt{x} = k \\) to find \\( k \\) with the known values (\\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 4 \\)).\n  \n- **Strategy 2:** After finding \\( k \\), set up the equation again with \\( y = 1 \\) to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n- **Alternative Thoughts:** I could also consider if there's a different way to represent the inverse relationship, but this approach seems straightforward.\n\n**Reflecting:** This approach makes sense because we have a direct relationship formula. Let's proceed with Strategy 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Constant \\( k \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI know that \\( y \\) varies inversely as \\( \\sqrt{x} \\), which means:\n\n\\[\ny \\times \\sqrt{x} = k\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 4 \\), I can plug these values into the equation to find \\( k \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nk = 4 \\times \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Multiplying \\( 4 \\) by \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) gives me:\n\n\\[\nk = 4\\sqrt{2} \\approx 5.656\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Does this value make sense? Yes, \\( k \\) should be a constant that relates \\( y \\) and \\( \\sqrt{x} \\). The calculation seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation for \\( y = 1 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I know \\( k = 4\\sqrt{2} \\), I can use it to find \\( x \\) when \\( y = 1 \\).\n\nThe formula remains the same:\n\n\\[\ny \\times \\sqrt{x} = k\n\\]\n\nPlugging in \\( y = 1 \\) and \\( k = 4\\sqrt{2} \\):\n\n\\[\n1 \\times \\sqrt{x} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks correct. I have \\( \\sqrt{x} = 4\\sqrt{2} \\). To find \\( x \\), I need to square both sides.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\( x \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSquaring both sides should give me the value of \\( x \\). Let's do that.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx = (4\\sqrt{2})^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 16 \\times 2\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 32\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, \\( x = 32 \\) when \\( y = 1 \\). Let me quickly check if this makes sense within the context of the problem.\n\n**Check:** Is \\( x = 32 \\) a reasonable solution? Let's see:\n\n- When \\( x = 2 \\), \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414 \\), and \\( y = 4 \\times 1.414 \\approx 5.656 \\).\n- Now, with \\( x = 32 \\), \\( \\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2} \\), and multiplying by \\( y = 1 \\) gives \\( k = 4\\sqrt{2} \\), which is consistent.\n\nEverything checks out. The solution seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me verify that the relationship holds true with the found value of \\( x \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n\\[\ny \\times \\sqrt{x} = k\n\\]\n\nWith \\( y = 1 \\) and \\( x = 32 \\):\n\n\\[\n1 \\times \\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{True, as } (4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 32\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe equation holds true, confirming that \\( x = 32 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, checking calculations, and verifying the final result, I can confidently say that the value of \\( x \\) when \\( y = 1 \\) is **32**. Throughout the process, reflecting and checking each step ensured the solution's accuracy.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $y$ and $\\sqrt{x}$ are inversely proportional, this means that $y\\sqrt{x}=k$ for some constant $k$.  Substituting the given values, when $x=2$ and $y=4$, we find that $4\\sqrt{2}=k$.  Therefore, when $y=1$, we can solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\n1\\cdot\\sqrt{x}&=4\\sqrt{2}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (\\sqrt{x})^2&=(4\\sqrt{2})^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=16\\cdot2=\\boxed{32}\n\\end{align*}"
