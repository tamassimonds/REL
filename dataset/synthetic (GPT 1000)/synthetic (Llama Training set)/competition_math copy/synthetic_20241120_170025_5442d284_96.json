    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's dive into this problem and brainstorm different strategies to tackle it, just like a human would. I'll start with my initial thoughts, explore various methods, reflect along the way, and check if each approach is correct or if I need to pivot.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem asks how many triangles with positive areas can be formed by vertices at integer coordinates within a specific grid: \\(1 \\leq x \\leq 4\\) and \\(1 \\leq y \\leq 4\\). \n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Brainstorming:** This reminds me of combinatorial geometry problems I've seen before, where you count specific shapes within a grid of points.\n- **Similar Past Problems:** I've dealt with counting squares and rectangles within a grid, but triangles are different because their area depends on the base and height.\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure how to start\u2014maybe counting all possible triangles and then subtracting those with zero area?\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Count All Possible Combinations of Three Points:** Since a triangle is defined by three non-collinear points, perhaps I can start by selecting all sets of three points within the grid.\n2. **Exclude Degenerate Triangles:** After counting all combinations, subtract the number of collinear point sets (which don't form triangles).\n3. **Use Combinatorics:** Utilize combinations to simplify the counting process.\n4. **Geometric Considerations:** Consider the geometric properties of triangles to ensure they have positive areas.\n\n**Reflection:** Let's start by counting all possible combinations of three points and then see how many of those need to be excluded because they are collinear.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Count All Possible Triangles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Objective:** Determine the total number of ways to select three points from the grid.\n- **Grid Size:** The grid contains \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) points.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{16}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\binom{16}{3} = \\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 560\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** 560 seems reasonable given the grid size\u2014it's a common combinatorial result.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Is This Correct?** This number includes all possible sets of three points, but it also includes degenerate triangles (collinear points) that don't have a positive area.\n- **Next Step:** I need to subtract the number of collinear point sets to get the correct count of triangles with positive areas.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exclude Degenerate Triangles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Objective:** Subtract the number of combinations where the three points are collinear.\n- **Approach:** Count all sets of three collinear points within the grid.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Horizontal and Vertical Lines:** Count sets of three points on each row and each column.\n2. **Diagonal Lines:** Count sets of three points on both main diagonals and anti-diagonals.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Horizontal and Vertical Lines:**\n  - There are 4 rows, each with \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\) sets of collinear points.\n  - Similarly, there are 4 columns, each with \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\) sets.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Horizontal/Vertical} = 4 \\times 4 + 4 \\times 4 = 32\n\\]\n\n- **Diagonal Lines:**\n  - **Main Diagonal (\\(y = x\\)) and Anti-Diagonal (\\(y = 5 - x\\)):**\n    - Each has 4 points, so \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\) sets per diagonal.\n  - **Other Diagonals with 3 Points:**\n    - There are two such diagonals in each direction, each contributing \\(\\binom{3}{3} = 1\\) set.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Diagonals} = 4 + 4 + 2 \\times 1 + 2 \\times 1 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Total Degenerate Triangles:**\n\\[\n32 (\\text{Horizontal/Vertical}) + 12 (\\text{Diagonals}) = 44\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** 44 seems reasonable for a \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid.\n- **Reflection:** This includes all sets of three collinear points, ensuring that I've accounted for all degenerate triangles.\n\n**Correction:**\nWait a minute\u2014only sets of three points on the diagonals with exactly three points should count. Let's re-evaluate the diagonal counting:\n\n- **Main Diagonal and Anti-Diagonal with 4 Points:**\n  - Each has \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\) sets.\n- **Other Diagonals with 3 Points:**\n  - Only two such diagonals in each direction, each contributing \\(\\binom{3}{3} = 1\\) set.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Adjusted Diagonals} = 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Revised Total Degenerate Triangles:**\n\\[\n32 (\\text{Horizontal/Vertical}) + 12 (\\text{Diagonals}) = 44\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** The correction aligns the diagonal counting with the grid's structure, ensuring all degenerate triangles are accounted for.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Triangles with Positive Area**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Objective:** Subtract the number of degenerate triangles from the total number of combinations to find triangles with positive area.\n- **Calculation:** \\(560 - 44 = 516\\)\n\n\\[\n516 = 560 - 44\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** 516 is one of the answer choices provided, making it a plausible solution.\n- **Deeper Reflection:** The subtraction correctly removes all collinear point sets, leaving only non-degenerate triangles.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Re-examination:** Does this approach make sense considering the grid's structure?\n- **Considerations:** \n  - **Overlapping Degenerate Triangles:** Ensure that no collinear sets are double-counted.\n  - **Combinatorial Accuracy:** Verify that the combinatorial calculations are correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Combinatorial Verification:** \n  - \\(\\binom{16}{3} = 560\\) is correct for selecting three points out of 16.\n  - \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\) is correct for selecting three collinear points in a line of four.\n  - \\(\\binom{3}{3} = 1\\) is correct for selecting all three collinear points in a line of three.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The approach accurately accounts for all possible triangles by first considering all point combinations and then excluding collinear sets.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{516}\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- **Confirmation:** The number 516 makes sense given the grid size and the constraints of the problem.\n- **Confidence:** I'm confident in this solution as it follows a logical step-by-step process, ensuring that all degenerate cases are accounted for and verifying each calculation along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Benefit of Step-by-Step Approach:** By breaking down the problem into manageable steps, I was able to systematically tackle each component, ensuring accuracy.\n- **Importance of Reflection:** Regularly checking and correcting assumptions (like the diagonal counting) prevented minor mistakes from affecting the final outcome.\n- **Takeaway:** When faced with combinatorial geometry problems, starting with a general count and then methodically excluding unwanted cases is an effective strategy.\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough provides clarity on how to approach such problems, highlighting the importance of brainstorming, reflecting, and verifying each step to arrive at the correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The vertices of the triangles are limited to a $4\\times4$ grid, with $16$ points total. Every triangle is determined by $3$ points chosen from these $16$ for a total of $\\binom{16}{3}=560$. However, triangles formed by collinear points do not have positive area. For each column or row, there are $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ such degenerate triangles. There are $8$ total columns and rows, contributing $32$ invalid triangles. There are also $4$ for both of the diagonals and $1$ for each of the $4$ shorter diagonals. There are a total of $32+8+4=44$ invalid triangles counted in the $560$, so the answer is $560-44=\\boxed{516}$."
