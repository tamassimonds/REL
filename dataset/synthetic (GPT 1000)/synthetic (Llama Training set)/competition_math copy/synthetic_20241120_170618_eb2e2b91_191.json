I remember dealing with circles before.\n\n- **Absolute Values:**  \n  The expression \\( |x| + |y| \\) involves absolute values, which makes me think about distances or lengths. Perhaps related to the corners of a square inscribed within the circle?\n\n- **Maximizing a Sum:**  \n  It looks like I'm trying to maximize the sum of the absolute values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). This reminds me of optimization problems where you want to find the largest or smallest value under certain constraints.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Geometric Approach:**  \n   Visualize the circle and see how \\( |x| + |y| \\) behaves at different points on the circumference.\n\n2. **Algebraic Manipulation:**  \n   Try to rewrite the equation or the expression to find a relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Use of Inequalities:**  \n   Perhaps apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other relevant inequalities to bound the sum.\n\n4. **Testing Specific Points:**  \n   Check specific points on the circle to see if a pattern emerges or if a maximum can be identified.\n\nHmm... the geometric approach seems intuitive, but I want to ensure it's correct. Let's start there and see if it leads us to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Geometric Visualization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Understanding the Circle:**  \n  The equation \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\) represents all points \\((x, y)\\) that lie on the circumference of a circle with radius 1.\n\n- **Analyzing \\( |x| + |y| \\):**  \n  The expression \\( |x| + |y| \\) can be interpreted as the sum of the absolute values of the coordinates. This reminds me of calculating the perimeter of a square, but I need to be sure.\n\n**Exploring the Circle:**\n\n- **Quadrants:**  \n  Since \\( |x| \\) and \\( |y| \\) are always non-negative, the maximum value should occur where both \\( |x| \\) and \\( |y| \\) are as large as possible within the circle.\n\n- **Square Inscription:**  \n  It strikes me that the maximum \\( |x| + |y| \\) might occur at the corners of a square inscribed within the circle.\n\n**Visual Check:**\n\n- **Corner Points:**  \n  Consider points where the circle intersects \\( y = x \\) and \\( y = -x \\).\n\n- **Evaluation:**  \n  If \\( x = y \\) or \\( x = -y \\), then \\( x^2 = y^2 \\). Let's see what happens there.\n\n**Thought Reflection:**\n\nWait, I need to confirm if this approach is correct. Are the corners indeed where the maximum occurs, or is there a better way?\n\n**Decision:**  \nLet's proceed with calculating specific points along \\( y = x \\) and \\( y = -x \\) to see if this aligns with our expectations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Points on \\( y = x \\) and \\( y = -x \\)**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- **Substituting \\( y = x \\) into the Circle Equation:**  \n  \\( x^2 + x^2 = 1 \\)  \n  \\( 2x^2 = 1 \\)  \n  \\( x^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\)  \n  \\( x = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\)  \n  So, \\( (x, y) = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\) and \\( \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\).\n\n- **Similarly for \\( y = -x \\):**  \n  \\( (x, y) = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\) and \\( \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\).\n\n**Calculating \\( |x| + |y| \\) at These Points:**\n\n- For \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\):  \n  \\( |x| + |y| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n- Similarly, for all these points, \\( |x| + |y| = \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, all these points give the same value \\( |x| + |y| = \\sqrt{2} \\). This suggests that the maximum occurs at these points. But is this definitive?\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n- **Multiple Points:**  \n  Since there are four points where \\( |x| + |y| = \\sqrt{2} \\), does this confirm that \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is indeed the maximum?\n\n- **Checking Against Other Strategies:**  \n  Maybe there's a more straightforward way to confirm this besides calculating multiple points.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nLet's explore another method to verify that \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is indeed the largest possible value.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Algebraic Manipulation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Maximizing \\( |x| + |y| \\):**  \n  To find the maximum, perhaps I can use an inequality or manipulate the expression to relate it directly to the circle equation.\n\n- **Use of Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:**  \n  This inequality might help in bounding \\( |x| + |y| \\).\n\n**Applying Cauchy-Schwarz:**\n\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that:  \n\\[ ( |x| + |y| )^2 \\leq (1^2 + 1^2)(x^2 + y^2) \\]\n\nGiven \\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\), this becomes:  \n\\[ ( |x| + |y| )^2 \\leq 2 \\times 1 \\]  \n\\[ |x| + |y| \\leq \\sqrt{2} \\]\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThis inequality suggests that the maximum value of \\( |x| + |y| \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). Since we've already found that at specific points on the circle, \\( |x| + |y| = \\sqrt{2} \\), this confirms our earlier finding.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNice! The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality provides a formal proof that \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is indeed the maximum value. This reinforces our geometric approach.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?**  \n  Yes, because the inequality is tight, meaning the maximum is achieved at specific points (like \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\) and \\( -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\)).\n\n**Decision:**\n\nWith two methods converging to the same maximum value, I'm confident that \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies Confirmed the Same Result:**  \n  Both the geometric approach and the algebraic manipulation using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality led us to the same maximum value of \\( |x| + |y| = \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n- **Understanding the Result:**  \n  The maximum \\( |x| + |y| \\) occurs at points where the circle intersects the lines \\( y = x \\) and \\( y = -x \\).\n\n- **Validity of the Approaches:**  \n  The geometric visualization helped identify candidate points, while the algebraic approach provided a formal bound confirming the maximum.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**The largest possible value of \\( |x| + |y| \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\).**\n\n---\n\n### **Recap of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Brainstorming:**  \n  Started by identifying the shape represented by the equation and the meaning of the expression to be maximized.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:**  \n  Considered geometric visualization, algebraic manipulation, and testing specific points.\n\n- **Step-by-Step Approach:**  \n  First calculated specific points on the circle, then verified the maximum using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\n- **Reflection and Checking:**  \n  Regularly checked if the approaches aligned and confirmed the correctness of the result.\n\n- **Adapting the Method:**  \n  Initially focused on the geometric approach, then supported it with an algebraic proof to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis human-like thinking process, complete with brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting, and checking, led us to confidently conclude that the maximum value is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\).",
