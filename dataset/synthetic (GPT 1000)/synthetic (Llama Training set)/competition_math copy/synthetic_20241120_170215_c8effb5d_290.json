    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle the problem of determining how many zeros the number \\( 236! \\) ends with when expressed as an integer. I'll walk through my thought process step-by-step, exploring different strategies, reflecting along the way, and making adjustments as needed\u2014just like a human would approach it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst off, I want to make sure I fully grasp what's being asked. The question is about finding the number of zeros at the end of \\( 236! \\). \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- Hmm, I remember from previous problems that trailing zeros in factorials are related to the factors of 10.\n- A factor of 10 is made up of 2 and 5. Since multiples of 2 are more frequent than multiples of 5 in factorials, I suspect the number of zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Strategy A:** Count the number of factors of 5 in \\( 236! \\).\n- **Strategy B:** Check if there's a need to consider higher powers of 5 (like \\( 5^2, 5^3 \\), etc.).\n- **Strategy C:** Calculate a few smaller factorials to see if the pattern holds.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Counting factors of 5 seems like a solid starting point since 2s are abundant.\n- I recall that higher powers of 5 contribute additional factors. For example, \\( 25 = 5 \\times 5 \\) contributes an extra 5.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- I'll start by counting the factors of 5 in \\( 236! \\), considering higher powers as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Implementing Strategy A\u2014Counting Factors of 5**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find the number of trailing zeros, I need to determine how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 236.\n- Each multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5.\n- Multiples of higher powers of 5 contribute additional 5s.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **Count multiples of 5:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Floor}(236 \\div 5) = 47\n   \\]\n   So, there are 47 numbers divisible by 5.\n\n2. **Count multiples of \\( 5^2 = 25 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Floor}(236 \\div 25) = 9\n   \\]\n   These contribute an additional 5.\n\n3. **Count multiples of \\( 5^3 = 125 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Floor}(236 \\div 125) = 1\n   \\]\n   Another extra 5.\n\n4. **Count multiples of \\( 5^4 = 625 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Floor}(236 \\div 625) = 0\n   \\]\n   No more contributions since 625 is greater than 236.\n\n**Total Count of Factors of 5:**\n\\[\n47 + 9 + 1 = 57\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Quick Check:** Does this seem reasonable? Yes, higher numbers contribute fewer factors, and 57 seems plausible.\n- **Closer Look:** Multiples of 5 provide one factor each, multiples of 25 provide an additional one, and so on. It's adding up correctly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- According to this calculation, \\( 236! \\) has 57 factors of 5.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach\u2014Does Counting Factors of 5 Suffice?**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Wait, I remember that for each trailing zero, there must be a pair of factors 2 and 5. But since there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, counting 5s should be enough.\n\n**Checking with a Smaller Example:**\n- Let's consider \\( 10! \\):\n  - Multiples of 5: 5, 10 \u2192 2 factors\n  - Multiples of 25: 25 \u2192 1 additional factor\n\n  Total: \\( 2 + 1 = 3 \\) factors of 5 \u2192 3 trailing zeros.\n\n- Does this match? Yes, \\( 10! = 3628800 \\) has 3 trailing zeros.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does the small example support the larger one?** Yes, the pattern holds.\n- **Do I need to adjust my approach?** No, counting factors of 5 is valid.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The strategy seems correct. Counting factors of 5 provides an accurate count of trailing zeros.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Addressing Potential Issues\u2014Is There a More Efficient Way?**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Strategy A Review:** Counting factors of 5 is standard practice. Is there a faster method?\n- **Strategy B:** Perhaps using logarithms or direct calculations for smaller factorials.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Logarithms:** Could be useful for larger numbers but might complicate the problem unnecessarily.\n- **Direct Calculation:** Feasible for smaller factorials but impractical for \\( 236! \\).\n\n**Realization:**\n- For \\( 236! \\), counting factors of 5 method is efficient and straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- No need to seek alternative methods. The current approach is optimal for this problem size.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Check\u2014Ensuring Accuracy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let me recheck the calculations to ensure they're correct.\n\n**Recalculations:**\n1. Multiples of 5: \\( 236 \\div 5 = 47 \\)\n2. Multiples of 25: \\( 236 \\div 25 = 9 \\)\n3. Multiples of 125: \\( 236 \\div 125 = 1 \\)\n4. Multiples of 625: \\( 236 \\div 625 = 0 \\)\n\n**Adding Up:**\n\\[\n47 + 9 + 1 + 0 = 57\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does the addition make sense?** Yes.\n- **Is there anything amiss?** No, all steps align with the expected logic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The final count of 57 factors of 5 is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nAfter carefully examining the problem, experimenting with different strategies, and verifying each step, the number of zeros at the end of \\( 236! \\) is **57**.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Understanding the Problem:** Essential for identifying the correct approach.\n- **Exploring Strategies:** Helps in finding the most efficient method.\n- **Reflection and Verification:** Crucial for ensuring accuracy, especially with large numbers.\n- **Flexibility in Approach:** Being open to changing methods when something doesn't feel right leads to better solutions.\n\nBy thinking through each step and continuously checking my work, I've arrived at a confident conclusion. This human-like approach\u2014messy at times but reflective\u2014ensures that the final answer is both accurate and reliable.",

  "ground_truth": "To find the number of terminal zeros, we must find the number of products $2\\times5$ in $236!$. Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, we can get our answer by finding the largest power of 5 that divides $236!$.  Every multiple of 5 less than 236 gives a factor of 5, each multiple of 25 gives an additional factor of 5, and each multiple of 125 gives a third factor of 5.  Therefore, the number of factors of 5 in $236!$ is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{5}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{25}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{125}\\right\\rfloor = 47+9+1=57$. The highest power of 5 that divides $236!$ is $5^{57}$ so $236!$ ends in $\\boxed{57}$ zeros."
