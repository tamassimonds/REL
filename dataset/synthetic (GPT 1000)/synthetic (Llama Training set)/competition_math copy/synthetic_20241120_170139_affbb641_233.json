I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, reflect on whether each step makes sense, and check my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d think through it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem is **If \\(5^x = 100\\), what is the value of \\(5^{x+2}\\)?**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of exponent rules I've seen before. I vaguely recall that when you deal with exponents involving addition, there's a property that might help.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:**\n  - **Use Exponent Properties:** Perhaps I can leverage the property \\(a^{m+n} = a^m \\cdot a^n\\).\n  - **Solve for \\(x\\):** Maybe I can find the exact value of \\(x\\) and then calculate \\(5^{x+2}\\) directly.\n  - **Logarithms:** Alternatively, I could use logarithms to solve for \\(x\\), but that seems a bit more involved.\n  - **Express \\(5^{x+2}\\) in Terms of \\(5^x\\):** Another approach could be to manipulate the expression to relate it directly to \\(5^x\\).\n\n- **Wait, maybe I shouldn't delve into logarithms right away.** It seems more straightforward to use properties of exponents to relate \\(5^{x+2}\\) directly to \\(5^x\\).\n\nHmm, let's see where this leads...\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Express \\(5^{x+2}\\) Using Exponent Properties**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find \\(5^{x+2}\\), I recall the property of exponents: \n\n\\[\na^{m+n} = a^m \\cdot a^n\n\\]\n\nSo, I can express \\(5^{x+2}\\) as:\n\n\\[\n5^{x+2} = 5^x \\cdot 5^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach makes sense because it breaks down \\(5^{x+2}\\) into parts that involve \\(5^x\\), which is given. If I know \\(5^x\\) and \\(5^2\\), I can simply multiply them to find \\(5^{x+2}\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this align with the properties I remember? Yes, \\(5^{x+2} = 5^x \\times 5^2\\) is correct because of the exponent addition rule.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substitute the Known Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to substitute the given value into the equation. From the problem, \\(5^x = 100\\), and I know \\(5^2 = 25\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n5^{x+2} = 5^x \\cdot 5^2 = 100 \\cdot 25\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n100 \\times 25 = 2500\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat was straightforward! By breaking down the exponent, I was able to use the given \\(5^x\\) value directly. Multiplying 100 by 25 feels correct, but let me double-check to be sure.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Is 2500 a reasonable answer for \\(5^{x+2}\\)? Given that \\(5^{x+2}\\) involves multiplying \\(5^x\\) (which is 100) by \\(5^2\\) (which is 25), 2500 seems logical.\n\n- **Deeper Reflection:** Could there be another way to verify this? Perhaps by calculating \\(5^{x+2}\\) directly if I had the exact value of \\(x\\), but that seems unnecessary since the exponent property worked well.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verify by Alternative Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEven though the first method worked, let\u2019s try another approach to ensure the solution is robust. Perhaps solving for \\(x\\) explicitly and then calculating \\(5^{x+2}\\) could serve as a verification step.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Use logarithms to solve for \\(x\\), then compute \\(5^{x+2}\\).\n\n**Exploring Logarithms:**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n5^x = 100\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), I can take the logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = \\log_5(100)\n\\]\n\nWait, let me think\u2014\\(\\log_5(100)\\) doesn't come out cleanly without a calculator, and it's not necessary since we already have a direct method that works.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nUsing logarithms here seems overcomplicated. The exponent property approach was much more straightforward. However, it's good to know that logarithms are available if needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIt's better to stick with the method that utilizes given information directly rather than overcomplicating with logarithms.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nFrom the initial approach:\n\n\\[\n5^{x+2} = 2500\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, multiplying \\(5^x\\) by \\(5^2\\) logically gives \\(5^{x+2}\\).\n- **Is 2500 an expected value?** Given the multiplication, it aligns with expectations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout this problem, starting with brainstorming different strategies helped me choose the most efficient path. By applying the exponent property directly related to the given information, I arrived at the correct solution swiftly. Checking the work along the way ensured accuracy, and considering an alternative method with logarithms confirmed that the initial approach was optimal. \n\nIn summary, **\\(5^{x+2} = 2500\\)** is the correct answer, and the step-by-step process, including reflections and checks, validated the approach and the solution.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough captures the natural thought process, exploring various strategies, reflecting on each step, and ensuring correctness through checks, just like a human would think through and solve the problem.",
