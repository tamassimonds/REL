    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see what we can come up with. I'll take you through my brainstorming process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on whether each step makes sense, and checking if I'm on the right track. Let's tackle it like a human would, complete with initial thoughts, uncertainties, and those \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see that it's defining an operation \\( a \\text{ Y } b = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \\). It reminds me of something\u2014maybe related to the square of a binomial? That connection feels familiar, but I want to be sure before proceeding.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Option 1:** Directly apply the definition by substituting \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\).\n- **Option 2:** Recognize the expression as a perfect square trinomial and simplify it.\n- **Option 3:** Explore if there's a pattern or property that makes calculation easier.\n\nMy gut tells me that recognizing it as a perfect square might simplify things, but let me explore both the direct approach and the perfect square idea to see which feels more straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Direct Substitution**\n\n**Step 1:** Apply the definition directly.\n\nGiven:  \n\\[ \na \\text{ Y } b = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\):  \n\\[ \n3 \\text{ Y } 2 = 3^2 - 2 \\times 3 \\times 2 + 2^2 \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's calculate each term one by one to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate each component.\n\n- \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 12 \\)\n- \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, subtracting 12 from 9 seems off. Let's double-check the order of operations.\n\n**Mistake Check:**  \nOh! I see I need to subtract the product term from the sum of squares, not just subtract blindly. Let me recalculate.\n\n**Correct Calculation:**\n\n\\[ \n3 \\text{ Y } 2 = 9 - 12 + 4 \n\\]  \n\\[ \n= 9 + 4 - 12 \n\\]  \n\\[ \n= 13 - 12 \n\\]  \n\\[ \n= 1 \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nThe final answer is 1. That seems reasonable, but let's see if there's a quicker way to verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Recognizing a Perfect Square**\n\n**Step 3:** Reevaluate the expression.\n\nLooking at the original operation:  \n\\[ \na \\text{ Y } b = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis looks like the expansion of \\( (a - b)^2 \\) because:\n\n\\[ \n(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Rewrite the operation using this identity.\n\nSo,  \n\\[ \na \\text{ Y } b = (a - b)^2 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, that simplifies things significantly. Now, instead of dealing with three terms, I only need to find the square of the difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Step 5:** Apply this simplification.\n\nFor \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\):  \n\\[ \n3 \\text{ Y } 2 = (3 - 2)^2 \n\\]  \n\\[ \n= 1^2 \n\\]  \n\\[ \n= 1 \n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nBoth methods\u2014direct substitution and recognizing the perfect square\u2014yield the same result: 1. This consistency gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n**Is the Answer Correct?**  \nYes, both strategies lead to the same conclusion:  \n\\[ \n3 \\text{ Y } 2 = 1 \n\\]\n\n**Was There a More Efficient Way?**  \nInitially, I considered applying the definition directly, which worked but felt a bit cumbersome. Recognizing the expression as a perfect square trinomial simplified the process significantly by reducing it to a single square calculation.\n\n**What Did I Learn?**  \nLooking for patterns or algebraic identities can often streamline problem-solving efforts. Identifying that \\( a \\text{ Y } b \\) is just \\( (a - b)^2 \\) made the calculation straightforward and confirmed the accuracy through multiple approaches.\n\n**Next Steps:**  \nIf this were part of a larger problem set, I would continue applying similar strategies to other operations defined in the questions, always checking for patterns or simplifications that make calculations easier.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies\u2014first attempting a direct application of the definition and then recognizing the underlying algebraic identity\u2014I confirmed that \\( 3 \\text{ Y } 2 = 1 \\). Reflecting on each step and checking the work ensured accuracy and provided insights into more efficient problem-solving techniques.\n\nThis journey involved initial uncertainty, strategy exploration, and multiple checks, mirroring a natural human approach to tackling mathematical problems.",
