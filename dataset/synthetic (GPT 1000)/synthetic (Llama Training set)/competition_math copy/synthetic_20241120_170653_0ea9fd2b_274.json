    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as necessary\u2014just like I would naturally think through a problem.\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I see that there are two **concentric circles** (circles sharing the same center, P). The problem involves **arcs** on both circles formed by specific **angles** at P, and it states that the arc lengths are equal. Our goal is to find the **ratio of the areas** of the two circles.\n\n**First Impressions:**\n- This reminds me of problems involving **proportions** and **circle properties**\u2014like relationships between angles and arc lengths.\n- I think I need to relate the **radii** of the circles to these arc lengths since that's where the arcs are drawn.\n- Maybe using **proportionality** between arc lengths and radii could be key here.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Let's explore a few strategies to see which one might work.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Proportionality of Arc Lengths to Radii:**\n   - Since arc length depends on the radius and the angle, perhaps I can set up a ratio based on this.\n\n2. **Using the Formula for Arc Length:**\n   - Recall that arc length \\( s = r \\theta \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( \\theta \\) is the angle in **radians**. Maybe converting degrees to radians could help.\n\n3. **Relating Areas to Radii:**\n   - The area of a circle is \\( \\pi r^2 \\), so perhaps I can find a relationship between the radii directly.\n\n4. **Setting Up Equations from Given Information:**\n   - Use the information about equal arc lengths to form equations involving the radii.\n\n**Reflecting on These Strategies:**\n- The first two strategies seem closely related: using the arc length formula directly ties to the radii and angles.\n- The third strategy about areas is tempting, but I think I need to establish the relationship between the radii first.\n- The fourth strategy involves setting up equations, which might be effective once I have the arc length relation.\n\n**Deciding to Start With:**\nLet\u2019s begin with the **Proportionality of Arc Lengths to Radii** and **Using the Arc Length Formula**. If this doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll reconsider and try a different approach.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding Arc Length Formula**\n\nThe formula for the length of an arc is:\n\n\\[\ns = r \\theta\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( s \\) is the arc length\n- \\( r \\) is the radius\n- \\( \\theta \\) is the angle in **radians**\n\n**Reflection:**\nI remember from previous problems that converting degrees to radians is crucial because the arc length formula requires radians. Let me make sure I do that correctly.\n\n### **Step 2: Converting Degrees to Radians**\n\nGiven:\n- The smaller circle has a **45-degree** angle.\n- The larger circle has a **36-degree** angle.\n\n**Conversion Formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{radians} = \\frac{\\pi \\text{ radians}}{180 \\text{ degrees}} \\times \\text{degrees}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **45 degrees** to radians:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\theta_{\\text{small}} = 45^\\circ \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians}\n  \\]\n  \n- **36 degrees** to radians:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\theta_{\\text{large}} = 36^\\circ \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} = \\frac{\\pi}{5} \\text{ radians}\n  \\]\n\n**Checking Work:**\nWait a minute\u2014let me double-check these conversions:\n\n- 45 degrees is half of 90 degrees, which should be \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) radians. Halving that makes sense: \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\).\n  \n- 36 degrees: I recall that \\( \\frac{\\pi}{5} \\) radians is indeed 36 degrees because \n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{5} = 36 \\text{ degrees}\n  \\]\n  \n**Conclusion:**\nThe conversions seem correct. Moving on.\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up Arc Length Equations**\n\nAccording to the problem, the arc lengths are equal:\n\n\\[\ns_{\\text{small}} = s_{\\text{large}}\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nr_{\\text{small}} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{4} = r_{\\text{large}} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**\n\nThe \\( \\pi \\) cancels out on both sides:\n\n\\[\nr_{\\text{small}} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = r_{\\text{large}} \\times \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Multiplying Both Sides by 20 to Eliminate Fractions:**\n\n\\[\n5 r_{\\text{small}} = 4 r_{\\text{large}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThat's a clean equation. It shows a direct relationship between the radii of the two circles. I think this is a good starting point.\n\n### **Step 4: Expressing the Ratio of Radii**\n\nFrom the equation above, we can express the ratio of the radii:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r_{\\text{small}}}{r_{\\text{large}}} = \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Checking Work:**\nI\u2019ll verify if this makes sense logically. If the arc lengths are proportional to the radii and we\u2019ve set up the equation correctly, this ratio should be valid.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe ratio \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) seems reasonable. However, the problem asks for the ratio of the **areas** of the circles, not the radii. Let\u2019s proceed to find the ratio of the areas using this radius ratio.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Ratio of Areas**\n\nRecall that the area of a circle is:\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi r^2\n\\]\n\n**So, the ratio of the areas is:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A_{\\text{small}}}{A_{\\text{large}}} = \\frac{\\pi r_{\\text{small}}^2}{\\pi r_{\\text{large}}^2} = \\left( \\frac{r_{\\text{small}}}{r_{\\text{large}}} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\n**Substituting the Ratio of Radiis:**\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)^2 = \\frac{16}{25}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, let\u2019s make sure this is correct. The area of a circle depends on the square of the radius, so squaring the ratio of the radii to find the area ratio seems logical and follows from the properties of circles.\n\n### **Step 6: Final Answer**\n\nThe ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger circle is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{16}{25}}\n\\]\n\n**Checking Work:**\n- **Proportionality:** The arc lengths are proportional to the radii, leading to a correct ratio.\n- **Area Calculation:** The area ratio is indeed the square of the radius ratio, which aligns with circle geometry principles.\n- **Units and Simplifications:** All units (radians, meters, etc.) cancel out appropriately, leaving a dimensionless ratio, which is expected for area comparisons.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nThe approach seems solid. By relating the arc lengths to the radii and then connecting the radii to the areas, I arrived at the correct ratio. This step-by-step method, with constant checking and reflection, ensured the accuracy of the solution.\n\n**Endnote:**\nThroughout the process, brainstorming helped explore different strategies, and reflecting allowed me to confirm the validity of each step. Whenever something felt off, I paused to rethink and adjust the approach\u2014just like a human would when solving a problem. This method ensured a thorough and accurate solution to the problem.",
