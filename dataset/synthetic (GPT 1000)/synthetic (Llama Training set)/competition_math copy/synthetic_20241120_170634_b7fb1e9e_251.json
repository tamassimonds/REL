    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies and reflecting on each step to ensure correctness. I'll approach it like I would if I'm solving it on paper, exploring various methods, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, so we have a circle with a radius of 3 inches. There's a chord \\( CD \\) within this circle, and the distance from the center of the circle to the chord is 2 inches. **We need to find the length of chord \\( CD \\)** in simplest radical form.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Reflecting on Similar Problems:** This reminds me of problems involving right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem, where the radius acts as the hypotenuse.\n  \n- **Thinking About Strategies:**\n  - Maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem by drawing perpendiculars or radii to the chord.\n  - Could there be a relationship involving the chord's midpoint and the center of the circle?\n  - Alternatively, perhaps trigonometric ratios might help if I consider angles.\n\n- **Uncertainties:** I'm not entirely sure how trigonometry would apply here without knowing angles. The Pythagorean theorem seems more straightforward since we have lengths.\n\n### **Step 1: Drawing a Diagram**\n\n**Action:** Let's sketch the situation to visualize it better.\n\n- **Description of the Diagram:**\n  - Draw a circle with center \\( O \\) and radius 3 inches.\n  - Locate a chord \\( CD \\) with its perpendicular distance from the center \\( O \\) to the chord as 2 inches.\n  - Mark the midpoint of chord \\( CD \\) as \\( M \\).\n  \n- **Reflection:** By marking the midpoint, I can see potential right triangles forming, which might help apply the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n**Thought Process:** Having a visual representation often clarifies the relationships between different elements. It looks like drawing lines from the center to the midpoint of the chord and to the endpoints of the chord could create two congruent right triangles.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Right Triangles**\n\n**Action:** Consider the triangles formed by the radius, the distance to the chord, and half the chord's length.\n\n- **Observation:**\n  - Triangle \\( OMB \\) (where \\( B \\) is an endpoint of \\( CD \\)) is a right triangle.\n  - \\( OM \\) is 2 inches (distance from center to chord).\n  - \\( OB \\) is 3 inches (radius).\n  - Need to find \\( MB \\) (half the chord's length).\n  \n**Reflection:** This setup looks like a classic right triangle scenario, which makes me think the Pythagorean theorem will be useful here.\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\n**Action:** Use the Pythagorean theorem to find \\( MB \\).\n\n- **Pythagorean Theorem Formula:**\n  \n  \\[\n  OA^2 = OM^2 + MB^2\n  \\]\n  \n  Where:\n  - \\( OA \\) is the radius (3 inches),\n  - \\( OM \\) is the distance to the chord (2 inches),\n  - \\( MB \\) is half the length of the chord.\n  \n- **Plugging in Values:**\n  \n  \\[\n  3^2 = 2^2 + MB^2\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  9 = 4 + MB^2\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  MB^2 = 5\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  MB = \\sqrt{5}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection and Check:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Taking the square root of 5 gives an approximate value of about 2.24 inches. Since \\( MB \\) is half the chord, the full chord \\( CD \\) would be \\( 2 \\times \\sqrt{5} \\).\n  \n- **Quick Check:** Let me briefly check if the lengths seem reasonable. The radius is 3 inches, and the distance to the chord is 2 inches. So, half the chord being about 2.24 inches seems plausible.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Length of Chord \\( CD \\)**\n\n**Action:** Since \\( MB = \\sqrt{5} \\), the full length of the chord \\( CD \\) is twice this:\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  CD = 2 \\times MB = 2 \\times \\sqrt{5} = 2\\sqrt{5}\n  \\]\n  \n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Does the final answer seem reasonable?** Expressing the length in simplest radical form as \\( 2\\sqrt{5} \\) aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\n- **Final Check:** Let me quickly verify the steps:\n  - The Pythagorean theorem was applied correctly.\n  - The relationship between radius, distance to chord, and half the chord's length is accurate.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Length of Chord \\( CD \\):**\n\n\\[\nCD = 2\\sqrt{5} \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Overall Approach:** Using the Pythagorean theorem was effective here because it directly related the known lengths (radius and distance to chord) to the unknown (half the chord's length).\n  \n- **Alternative Strategies:** Initially considered trigonometry, but realized it wasn't necessary since the Pythagorean theorem provided a straightforward path.\n\n- **Mistakes and Adjustments:** No major mistakes, but reflecting on whether to use trigonometry helped confirm that the chosen method was appropriate.\n\n- **Key Takeaway:** Visualizing the problem with a diagram and identifying right triangles made it easier to apply the Pythagorean theorem effectively.\n\nThis step-by-step exploration, including brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting the approach, led to the correct length of chord \\( CD \\) being \\( 2\\sqrt{5} \\) inches.",

  "ground_truth": "Call the center of the circle O, and call the point where the radius of the circle bisects the chord E.  Thus, the line segment from the center of the circle to point E has length 2, and we have $\\triangle ODE$ with a leg of 2 and a hypotenuse of 3.  Thus, the other leg, DE has length $\\sqrt{5}$, and since DE is $\\frac{CD}{2}$, we have $CD = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}$."
