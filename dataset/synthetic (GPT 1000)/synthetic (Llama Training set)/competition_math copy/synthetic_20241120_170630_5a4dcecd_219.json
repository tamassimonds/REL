    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. I'll start by really thinking through what's being asked and exploring different strategies. It's important to brainstorm and reflect often, just like I would if I were tackling this problem on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nThe problem states:\n\nLet \\( z \\) be a complex number satisfying \\( z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\). Compute  \n\\[ z^{97} + z^{98} + z^{99} + z^{100} + z^{101}. \\]\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Familiar Equation:** The equation \\( z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\) reminds me of quadratic equations I've solved before. I recall that the roots might be related to complex numbers, possibly involving the cube roots of unity.\n- **Power Exponents:** We're dealing with high exponents (up to 101), which suggests that finding a pattern or using properties of roots might be helpful. Direct calculation would be impractical.\n- **Geometric Interpretation:** Maybe there's a geometric interpretation since complex numbers often have visual components that can simplify calculations.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Perhaps using recursive relationships, leveraging the properties of polynomial roots, or applying De Moivre's Theorem could work.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Option 1:** Solve for \\( z \\) using the quadratic formula to find the roots.\n- **Option 2:** Observe if \\( z \\) is one of the cube roots of unity and use that property.\n- **Option 3:** Write higher powers of \\( z \\) in terms of lower powers, possibly finding a recurrence relation.\n- **Option 4:** Explore geometric series if applicable.\n\n**Reflecting on Possible Starting Points:**\n- Solving for \\( z \\) directly might give me the roots, but I'm concerned about the complexity of calculating high powers.\n- Leveraging the fact that \\( z \\) is a root of unity could simplify things significantly.\n- Maybe starting with identifying \\( z \\) as a cube root of unity and seeing how that helps with the exponents.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Solving for \\( z \\) Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find \\( z \\), I recall the quadratic formula:  \n  \\[ z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]  \n  Here, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = 1 \\).\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  z = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 1}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{-3}}{2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  z = \\frac{-1 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n- **Quick Check:** The discriminant is negative (\\(-3\\)), leading to complex roots, which aligns with my initial thought about the roots being related to complex numbers.\n- **Reflection:** This makes sense because the equation has no real solutions, and the roots are complex conjugates, which is typical for equations where the discriminant is negative.\n\n**Realization:**\n- **Root Identification:** The roots are \\( z = \\frac{-1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{-1 - i\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\). These are the cube roots of unity, specifically \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\omega^2 \\), where \\( \\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 3} \\).\n\n- **Connection:** This is an important insight because it suggests that \\( z^3 = 1 \\), which can simplify the calculations for higher powers.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Is This Helpful?** Yes, knowing that \\( z \\) is a cube root of unity allows me to use properties of roots of unity, such as periodicity in exponents, to simplify the problem significantly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Leveraging the Properties of Cube Roots of Unity**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Cube Roots of Unity:** The three cube roots of unity are solutions to \\( z^3 = 1 \\): \\( 1, \\omega, \\omega^2 \\), where \\( \\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 3} \\).\n- **Key Property:** For any integer \\( n \\), \\( \\omega^3 = 1 \\). This means that powers of \\( \\omega \\) repeat every three exponents.\n  \n- **Application:** Since \\( z^3 = 1 \\), I can reduce higher powers of \\( z \\) modulo 3:\n  \\[\n  z^{97} = z^{3 \\times 32 + 1} = (z^3)^{32} \\cdot z^1 = 1^{32} \\cdot z = z\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  z^{98} = z^{3 \\times 32 + 2} = (z^3)^{32} \\cdot z^2 = 1^{32} \\cdot z^2 = z^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  z^{99} = z^{3 \\times 33} = (z^3)^{33} = 1^{33} = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  z^{100} = z^{3 \\times 33 + 1} = (z^3)^{33} \\cdot z^1 = 1^{33} \\cdot z = z\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  z^{101} = z^{3 \\times 33 + 2} = (z^3)^{33} \\cdot z^2 = 1^{33} \\cdot z^2 = z^2\n  \\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n- **Verification:** Each exponent is reduced modulo 3, aligning with the property \\( z^3 = 1 \\). This periodicity is exactly what I needed to simplify the calculations.\n\n**Realization:**\n- **Pattern Emergence:** The exponents cycle every three terms: \\( z, z^2, 1, z, z^2 \\).\n\n- **Summation Simplification:** This pattern repeats, so adding these five terms is straightforward.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Absolutely. By leveraging the fact that \\( z^3 = 1 \\), I've dramatically simplified the problem, avoiding the need to compute high powers directly.\n\n- **Potential Mistake Check:** Initially, I considered whether I needed to compute higher powers explicitly. However, recognizing the periodicity ensured I didn't go down a more complicated path.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Computing the Sum \\( z^{97} + z^{98} + z^{99} + z^{100} + z^{101} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Using the Pattern:** From the previous step, I identified that:\n  \\[\n  z^{97} = z, \\quad z^{98} = z^2, \\quad z^{99} = 1, \\quad z^{100} = z, \\quad z^{101} = z^2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Organizing the Terms:**\n  \\[\n  z^{97} + z^{98} + z^{99} + z^{100} + z^{101} = z + z^2 + 1 + z + z^2 = 2z + 2z^2 + 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying the Expression:**\n  \\[\n  2(z + z^2) + 1\n  \\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n- **Coefficient Check:** There are two \\( z \\) terms and two \\( z^2 \\) terms, along with a constant 1. This seems correct based on the pattern.\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, before proceeding, I should ensure that the sum \\( z + z^2 = -1 \\) because \\( z \\) is a root of \\( z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\).\n\n**Realization:**\n- **Polynomial Relationship:** From the original equation \\( z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \\), I can rearrange:\n  \\[\n  z + z^2 = -1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Substituting Back:**\n  \\[\n  2(z + z^2) + 1 = 2(-1) + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Final Check:** Substituting \\( z + z^2 = -1 \\) simplifies the expression neatly to \\(-1\\).\n\n- **Does This Match Expectations?** Yes, the sum verifies correctly, and using the polynomial relationship ensures there's no error.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\nz^{97} + z^{98} + z^{99} + z^{100} + z^{101} = -1\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Understanding and Brainstorming:** Recognized the equation's roots as cube roots of unity, considering different strategies like direct calculation, leveraging properties of roots, and exploring geometric series.\n\n2. **Solving for \\( z \\):** Used the quadratic formula to find the complex roots, identifying them as \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\omega^2 \\).\n\n3. **Applying Cube Root Properties:** Leveraged \\( z^3 = 1 \\) to simplify high exponents using modular arithmetic.\n\n4. **Computing the Sum:** Recognized the repeating pattern in exponents, simplified the expression using polynomial relationships, and ensured correctness through substitution.\n\n5. **Final Verification:** Checked each step for consistency and correctness, confirming that the sum equals \\(-1\\).\n\nThroughout the process, reflecting and checking each step ensured accuracy, allowing for adjustments when needed, and verifying the final answer aligns with expectations.",
