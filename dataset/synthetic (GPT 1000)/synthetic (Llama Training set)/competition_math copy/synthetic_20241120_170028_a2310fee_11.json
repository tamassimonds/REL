    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it manually. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, checking if they make sense, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem states:\n\n**Gretchen has eight socks, two of each color: magenta, cyan, black, and white. She randomly draws four socks. What is the probability that she has exactly one pair of socks with the same color?**\n\nHmm, at first glance, this reminds me of probability problems involving combinations and maybe the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The word \"exactly one pair\" stands out, which suggests that out of the four socks drawn, only two should be of the same color, and the other two should be of different colors.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure where to start. Let me brainstorm a bit...\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Combinatorial Approach:** \n   - Calculate the total number of ways to draw four socks.\n   - Determine the number of favorable outcomes where exactly one color has a pair.\n\n2. **Probability Tree Diagram:**\n   - Visualize the drawing process step by step to ensure only one pair is formed.\n\n3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**\n   - Use this to subtract overlapping cases where more than one pair exists.\n\nHmm, the combinatorial approach seems straightforward, but maybe combining it with the probability tree could help visualize the steps better. Let me start with the combinatorial approach and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Ways to Draw Four Socks**\n\nFirst, I need to determine the total number of combinations for drawing four socks out of eight.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- There are no restrictions at this point, so it's a simple combination calculation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{8}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{4} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 70\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes 70 seem reasonable? Yeah, drawing four out of eight isn't overly complicated, so that number makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Number of Favorable Outcomes with Exactly One Pair**\n\nNow, I need to find how many of those combinations have exactly one pair of the same color.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- First, choose the color that will have the pair.\n- Then, select the two socks of that color.\n- Next, choose two different socks from the remaining colors, ensuring no additional pairs are formed.\n\nThis feels a bit more complex, so let\u2019s break it down further.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2a: Choose the Color for the Pair**\n\nThere are four colors available: magenta, cyan, black, and white.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to choose the color for the pair} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nMakes sense\u2014there are four colors, so four ways to choose which one will have the pair.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2b: Select Two Socks of the Chosen Color**\n\nOnce the color is selected, I need to pick two socks out of the two available in that color.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to choose two socks from the chosen color} = \\binom{2}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait, that\u2019s always going to be 1 because there are only two socks of each color. Logical.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2c: Choose Two Socks from the Remaining Colors**\n\nNow, I need to select two socks from the remaining six socks, ensuring they are from different colors and don't form another pair.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I can't pick more than one sock from the same remaining color.\n- This is essentially choosing two different colors out of the three remaining and then picking one sock from each.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to choose two different colors from three} = \\binom{3}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{For each selected color, choose one sock} = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = 3 \\times 4 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait, let me think. \n- There are three remaining colors.\n- Choosing two different colors can be done in \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) ways.\n- For each selected color, picking one sock out of two for each color makes it \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n- So, \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) total ways.\n\nThat seems logical. \n\nBut let me double-check:\n- Picking two colors out of three: Easy.\n- For each, picking one sock: Also straightforward since each color has two socks.\n\nYeah, that adds up.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Favorable Outcomes**\n\nNow, I need to multiply the number of ways to choose the color for the pair by the number of ways to select the two different socks from the remaining colors.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Total favorable outcomes} = 4 \\times 12 = 48\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes 48 seem reasonable compared to the total of 70? \n- 48 out of 70 is about 68.57%, which feels plausible for having exactly one pair.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Probability**\n\nFinally, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{48}{70} = \\frac{24}{35}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nLet me simplify:\n\\[\n\\frac{48}{70} = \\frac{24}{35}\n\\]\nDoes this fraction make sense? Yeah, both numbers are divisible by 2, and 24 out of 35 seems like a reasonable probability for this scenario.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nOkay, let's pause here and reflect. \n- I started by determining the total number of combinations for drawing four socks.\n- Then, I calculated the number of favorable outcomes where exactly one pair exists by breaking down the problem into selecting the color for the pair and the remaining two socks.\n- Finally, I computed the probability as \\(\\frac{24}{35}\\).\n\nDoes everything seem correct? \n- Each step logically follows the previous one.\n- The numbers add up, and the probability makes sense.\n\nI\u2019m feeling confident about this solution, but let me consider if there might be a simpler approach or if I missed any edge cases.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Probability Tree Diagram**\n\nThinking about it, perhaps a probability tree could help visualize the steps better, especially ensuring that no more than one pair is formed. Let's briefly explore that idea.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Start by selecting the first sock.\n- For each subsequent sock, ensure that only one additional sock of the same color is picked later.\n\n**Reflection:**\nBut wait, this might complicate things because I'd have to account for the order and ensure no additional pairs are created, which overlaps with the combinatorial approach I already used. Given that the combinatorial method worked well, maybe it's best to stick with it.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore concluding, let me quickly verify:\n- **Total combinations:** 70\u2014seems correct.\n- **Favorable outcomes:** 48\u2014derived logically.\n- **Probability:** \\(\\frac{24}{35}\\)\u2014simplified correctly.\n\nEverything aligns, and the approach was methodical. I feel confident that the probability of Gretchen having exactly one pair of socks with the same color is \\(\\frac{24}{35}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough a step-by-step approach, starting with brainstorming different strategies and choosing the most straightforward combinatorial method, I determined that the probability is \\(\\frac{24}{35}\\). Reflecting and checking each step ensured the solution's accuracy, making me confident in the final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "There are a total of $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$ combinations of socks. We seek combinations that have one pair of socks with the same color and two separate socks with different colors for a total of three colors. There are $\\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose three colors. From each combination of three colors, there are $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways to choose a color for the only pair of socks.  There are 2 socks to choose from for each of the colors that only appear once among the four socks she chooses.
