    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll approach it like I would if I were tackling it on paper, reflecting, brainstorming, and checking my work along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nThe problem is:  \nEvaluate: \\(-\\left(14 \\div 2 \\cdot 9 - 60 + 3 \\cdot 9\\right)\\)\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \n- At first glance, this looks like a mix of division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition inside parentheses.\n- I remember that order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) is crucial here. Parentheses, exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, followed by addition and subtraction.\n- However, the presence of a negative sign outside the parentheses adds a layer of complexity.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- Should I simplify inside the parentheses first, following the order of operations?\n- Alternatively, maybe I can factor out common terms or rearrange the expression for easier handling.\n- I\u2019m considering whether breaking it down step by step is the best route or if there's a shortcut.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- I think starting inside the parentheses makes the most sense to follow the order of operations. Let\u2019s proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying Inside the Parentheses**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Following the order of operations, I should handle division and multiplication first before dealing with subtraction and addition.\n\n**Calculations:**   \n1. **Handle Division and Multiplication from Left to Right:**\n   \\[\n   14 \\div 2 = 7\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   7 \\cdot 9 = 63\n   \\]\n   \n   **Check:**  \n   - Wait, that seems straightforward. \\(14 \\div 2\\) is definitely \\(7\\), and multiplying \\(7 \\times 9\\) gives \\(63\\). This feels correct.\n\n2. **Proceeding with Subtraction and Addition:**\n   \\[\n   63 - 60 = 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3 + 3 \\cdot 9 = 3 + 27 = 30\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection:**  \n   - Hmm, the addition \\(3 + 3 \\cdot 9\\). I need to remember to handle the multiplication before addition. Let me double-check that.\n   - Yes, multiplication comes before addition, so \\(3 \\cdot 9\\) indeed is \\(27\\), and adding \\(3\\) gives \\(30\\). That seems right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Negative Sign Outside the Parentheses**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Now that I've simplified inside the parentheses to \\(30\\), I need to apply the negative sign outside.\n- Intuitively, this should make the entire expression inside the parentheses negative.\n\n**Calculation:**   \n\\[\n-\\left(30\\right) = -30\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n- Wait, that makes sense. The negative sign outside the parentheses negates the entire result inside. So, yes, \\(-30\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- To ensure correctness, let's quickly recapitulate the steps:\n  - Simplified \\(14 \\div 2 \\cdot 9\\) to \\(63\\)\n  - Combined \\(63 - 60 + 3 \\cdot 9\\) to \\(30\\)\n  - Applied the negative sign to get \\(-30\\)\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- Does \\(-30\\) seem reasonable considering the operations involved?\n- Yes, starting with \\(14 \\div 2 \\cdot 9\\) gives a large positive number, and after subtracting \\(60\\) and adding \\(27\\), arriving at \\(30\\) makes sense. Negating it to \\(-30\\) aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\n**Random Insight:**  \n- Is there an alternative approach?  \n  - Perhaps I could have factored or rearranged differently, but the straightforward method follows the order of operations neatly. It feels right.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Factoring**\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- Maybe there's a way to factor the expression to simplify calculations.\n- For instance, look for common factors or patterns.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Let's see if I can reorganize:  \n  \\[\n  -(14 \\div 2 \\cdot 9 - 60 + 3 \\cdot 9) = -(7 \\cdot 9 - 60 + 3 \\cdot 9)\n  \\]\n  \n- Wait, factoring doesn\u2019t seem to offer much here. The expression is already pretty flat. Perhaps it's better to stick with the order of operations.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Considering the straightforward approach was effective, maybe trying to factor isn\u2019t necessary. Sticking with what's working makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- Original Approach: Simplified inside the parentheses following the order of operations, applied the negative sign, and arrived at \\(-30\\).\n- Alternative Strategy: Attempted factoring but didn't find it beneficial given the problem's structure.\n- Conclusion: The initial step-by-step method was correct, and exploring factoring didn't provide additional advantages.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(-30\\)\n\n---\n\nBy approaching it step by step, reflecting on each stage, and checking along the way, I ensured the solution was accurate and aligned with the problem's requirements. This method also allowed me to catch any potential errors early and adjust my strategy as needed.",

  "ground_truth": "Recall that the order of operations says that we must perform the multiplication and division before we do the addition and subtraction.  Also, the operations inside the parentheses must be done before we negate the entire expression.
