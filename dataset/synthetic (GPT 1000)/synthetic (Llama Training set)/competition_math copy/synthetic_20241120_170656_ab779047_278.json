    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies and reflecting on each step to ensure I'm on the right path. Let's treat this like a real human problem-solving session, complete with exploration, checking, and adjusting our approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, we have three real numbers \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) that satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. \\(x + y + z = 5\\)\n2. \\(xy + xz + yz = 8\\)\n\nWe need to find the largest possible value of \\(x\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Symmetry:** This looks symmetric in \\(y\\) and \\(z\\). Maybe \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) are equal?\n- **Quadratic Equations:** The sum and product of pairs suggest a relationship that might involve quadratics.\n- **Inequalities:** Perhaps using inequalities like AM-GM to find bounds on \\(x\\).\n- **Substitution:** Can we express \\(y + z\\) and \\(yz\\) in terms of \\(x\\)?\n\nHonestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start, but these ideas are bubbling in my mind. Let me explore them one by one.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Assuming \\(y = z\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If \\(y = z\\), the equations simplify significantly. Maybe this can give us a quick hint about \\(x\\).\n\n**Attempting the Strategy:**\n\n1. Substitute \\(y = z\\) into the first equation:\n   \\[\n   x + y + z = x + 2y = 5 \\implies y = \\frac{5 - x}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n2. Substitute \\(y = z\\) into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   xy + xz + yz = xy + xz + y^2 = 8\n   \\]\n   Since \\(y = z\\), this becomes:\n   \\[\n   2xy + y^2 = 8\n   \\]\n   \n3. Substitute \\(y\\) from step 1:\n   \\[\n   2x\\left(\\frac{5 - x}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{5 - x}{2}\\right)^2 = 8\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   x(5 - x) + \\frac{(5 - x)^2}{4} = 8\n   \\]\n   \n4. Distribute and combine terms:\n   \\[\n   5x - x^2 + \\frac{25 - 10x + x^2}{4} = 8\n   \\]\n   Multiply everything by 4 to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[\n   20x - 4x^2 + 25 - 10x + x^2 = 32\n   \\]\n   Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   -3x^2 + 10x + 25 = 32 \\implies -3x^2 + 10x - 7 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n5. Solve the quadratic equation:\n   \\[\n   3x^2 - 10x + 7 = 0\n   \\]\n   Using the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{(-10)^2 - 4 \\times 3 \\times 7}}{2 \\times 3} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 - 84}}{6} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{6} = \\frac{10 \\pm 4}{6}\n   \\]\n   So, \\(x = \\frac{14}{6} = \\frac{7}{3}\\) or \\(x = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\\).\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- If \\(x = \\frac{7}{3}\\), then \\(y = z = \\frac{5 - \\frac{7}{3}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{15}{3} - \\frac{7}{3}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}}{2} = \\frac{4}{3}\\).\n  \n- Verify the second equation:\n  \\[\n  xy + xz + yz = \\frac{7}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{7}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{3} + \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = 2 \\times \\frac{28}{9} + \\frac{16}{9} = \\frac{56}{9} + \\frac{16}{9} = \\frac{72}{9} = 8\n  \\]\n  \n- This satisfies both equations, so \\(x = \\frac{7}{3}\\) is a valid solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, but we also found \\(x = 1\\). Let's see if there's a larger \\(x\\) possible by considering the other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Using Inequalities (AM-GM)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Maybe I can use the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality to find bounds for \\(x\\).\n\n**Attempting the Strategy:**\n\n1. Recall AM-GM for three numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x + y + z}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{xyz}\n   \\]\n   Given \\(x + y + z = 5\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{xyz} \\implies xyz \\leq \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{27} \\approx 4.63\n   \\]\n   \n2. However, without additional information, this bound on \\(xyz\\) doesn't directly help in maximizing \\(x\\). It seems like a dead end for maximizing \\(x\\) specifically.\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\nWait a second\u2014this approach doesn't seem to provide a clear path to finding the largest \\(x\\). Maybe I need to reconsider or combine it with another strategy.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nGiven that assuming \\(y = z\\) worked and AM-GM didn't add much value, perhaps focusing on quadratic relationships is a better path.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Expressing \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) in Terms of \\(x\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let's try to express \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) in terms of \\(x\\) and see if that leads us to a useful quadratic equation.\n\n**Attempting the Strategy:**\n\n1. From the first equation:\n   \\[\n   y + z = 5 - x\n   \\]\n   \n2. From the second equation:\n   \\[\n   xy + xz + yz = 8\n   \\]\n   Substitute \\(y + z = 5 - x\\):\n   \\[\n   x(y + z) + yz = 8 \\implies x(5 - x) + yz = 8 \\implies 5x - x^2 + yz = 8 \\implies yz = x^2 - 5x + 8\n   \\]\n   \n3. Now, we have:\n   \\[\n   y + z = 5 - x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad yz = x^2 - 5x + 8\n   \\]\n   \n4. These are the sum and product of \\(y\\) and \\(z\\). We can set up a quadratic equation:\n   \\[\n   t^2 - (y + z)t + yz = 0 \\implies t^2 - (5 - x)t + (x^2 - 5x + 8) = 0\n   \\]\n   \n5. For \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) to be real numbers, the discriminant must be non-negative:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Discriminant} = (5 - x)^2 - 4(x^2 - 5x + 8) \\geq 0\n   \\]\n   \n6. Expanding the discriminant:\n   \\[\n   (5 - x)^2 - 4(x^2 - 5x + 8) = 25 - 10x + x^2 - 4x^2 + 20x - 32 = -3x^2 + 10x - 7\n   \\]\n   \n7. We need:\n   \\[\n   -3x^2 + 10x - 7 \\geq 0\n   \\]\n   \n8. Multiply the inequality by \\(-1\\) (which reverses the inequality):\n   \\[\n   3x^2 - 10x + 7 \\leq 0\n   \\]\n   \n9. Solve the quadratic inequality:\n   \\[\n   3x^2 - 10x + 7 = 0\n   \\]\n   Using the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 - 84}}{6} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{6} = \\frac{10 \\pm 4}{6}\n   \\]\n   So, \\(x = \\frac{14}{6} = \\frac{7}{3}\\) or \\(x = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\\).\n   \n10. The quadratic opens upwards (coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is positive), so the inequality \\(3x^2 - 10x + 7 \\leq 0\\) holds between the roots:\n    \\[\n    1 \\leq x \\leq \\frac{7}{3}\n    \\]\n    \n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- This matches our earlier result from assuming \\(y = z\\).\n- \\(x = \\frac{7}{3}\\) is the largest value satisfying both original equations.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBy expressing \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) in terms of \\(x\\) and finding the discriminant condition for real \\(y\\) and \\(z\\), we've confirmed that the largest possible value of \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac{7}{3}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying through multiple approaches, the largest possible value of \\(x\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{7}{3}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Strategy Validation:** Assuming \\(y = z\\) simplified the problem effectively, leading us to the correct quadratic inequality for \\(x\\).\n- **Alternative Strategies:** AM-GM didn't provide additional insights, and the quadratic approach was most straightforward.\n- **Checking Throughout:** Consistently checking each step ensured that we didn't miss any conditions or make calculation errors.\n- **Learning Point:** Sometimes, simplifying assumptions (like \\(y = z\\)) can lead directly to the solution, but it's essential to verify that these assumptions are valid.\n\nBy thinking through each step and reflecting along the way, we arrived confidently at the solution.",
