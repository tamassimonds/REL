    "working_out": "**Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this inequality step by step. The given problem is:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} \\right| > 2\n\\]\n\nWhen I first see this, a few things come to mind:\n\n- **Absolute Value Inequality:** I've dealt with absolute value inequalities before. They typically involve breaking the absolute value into two cases: one where the expression inside is positive and one where it's negative.\n  \n- **Rational Expression:** The fact that there's a fraction makes me think about possible restrictions on the variable \\(x\\) \u2014 specifically, points where the denominator could be zero, leading to undefined values.\n  \n- **Comparing With Constants:** The inequality involves comparing a fraction to a constant (2 in this case), which is similar to inequalities I've solved where I set up separate equations based on the absolute value condition.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify Critical Points:** Determine where the expression inside the absolute value is equal to 2 and -2. These points will help in setting up the intervals for testing.\n\n2. **Consider Denominator Restrictions:** Check where the denominator \\(x - 1\\) is zero, as this would make the expression undefined.\n\n3. **Break Into Cases:** Set up cases for when the expression inside the absolute value is greater than or less than zero to handle the absolute value correctly.\n\n4. **Solve Each Case:** Solve the resulting inequalities from each case to find the solution set.\n\n**Let's Dive In:**\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Identify Critical Points**\n\nI need to find where:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} \\right| = 2\n\\]\n\nThis leads to two equations:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} = -2\n\\]\n\n**Case 1:** \\(\\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} = 2\\)\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(x - 1\\) (assuming \\(x \\neq 1\\)):\n\n\\[\n2x - 1 = 2(x - 1)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n2x - 1 = 2x - 2 \\\\\n-1 = -2\n\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right. This leads to a contradiction. Hmm, maybe I misstepped.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAh, I see. The equation simplifies to \\(-1 = -2\\), which is impossible. This suggests that there's no solution in this case. Perhaps the absolute value being equal to 2 doesn't intersect with the line \\(y = 2\\) represented by this equation.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me think about it. If multiplying both sides by \\(x - 1\\) led to a contradiction, perhaps there\u2019s an issue with assuming \\(x - 1 \\neq 0\\). But since dividing by zero is undefined, I\u2019ll proceed with \\(x \\neq 1\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Solve the Second Equation**\n\n**Case 2:** \\(\\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} = -2\\)\n\nAgain, multiplying both sides by \\(x - 1\\):\n\n\\[\n2x - 1 = -2(x - 1)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n2x - 1 = -2x + 2 \\\\\n2x + 2x = 2 + 1 \\\\\n4x = 3 \\\\\nx = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, \\(x = \\frac{3}{4}\\) is a valid solution. This makes sense because it doesn't lead to any contradictions.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me quickly verify. If \\(x = \\frac{3}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2(\\frac{3}{4}) - 1}{\\frac{3}{4} - 1} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2} - 1}{-\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{-\\frac{1}{4}} = -2\n\\]\n\nTaking the absolute value:\n\n\\[\n| -2 | = 2\n\\]\n\nSo this checks out. The critical point where the absolute value equals 2 is \\(x = \\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Consider Denominator Restrictions**\n\nBefore proceeding, I need to ensure that \\(x - 1 \\neq 0\\), as the expression is undefined at \\(x = 1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to consider this because including \\(x = 1\\) in the solution would make the expression undefined, leading to an incorrect solution set.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Setting Up the Number Line**\n\nNow, let's set up a number line to determine the intervals where the inequality \\(\\left| \\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} \\right| > 2\\) holds true.\n\nThe critical points are:\n\n1. \\(x = \\frac{3}{4}\\) (where the absolute value equals 2)\n2. \\(x = 1\\) (where the expression is undefined)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI should break the number line into intervals around these points to test which intervals satisfy the inequality.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Testing Intervals**\n\nLet\u2019s test the intervals:\n\n1. **Interval 1:** \\( (-\\infty, \\frac{3}{4}) \\)\n2. **Interval 2:** \\( (\\frac{3}{4}, 1) \\)\n3. **Interval 3:** \\( (1, \\infty) \\)\n\n**Testing Interval 1: \\( (-\\infty, \\frac{3}{4}) \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s pick a test point, say \\(x = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{2(0) - 1}{0 - 1} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{-1}{-1} \\right| = |1| = 1\n\\]\n\nComparison:\n\n\\[\n1 > 2 \\quad \\text{(False)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that doesn\u2019t work. The inequality is not satisfied in this interval. So, there are no solutions here.\n\n**Check:**\n\nQuick check: The absolute value is 1, which is less than 2. This makes sense.\n\n---\n\n**Testing Interval 2: \\( (\\frac{3}{4}, 1) \\)**\n\nPick a test point, say \\(x = \\frac{7}{8}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{2(\\frac{7}{8}) - 1}{\\frac{7}{8} - 1} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{\\frac{14}{8} - 1}{-\\frac{1}{8}} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{\\frac{6}{8}}{-\\frac{1}{8}} \\right| = \\left| -\\frac{6}{1} \\right| = 6\n\\]\n\nComparison:\n\n\\[\n6 > 2 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis works! The inequality is satisfied in this interval.\n\n**Check:**\n\nQuick check: The absolute value is 6, which is greater than 2. This aligns with our expectation.\n\n---\n\n**Testing Interval 3: \\( (1, \\infty) \\)**\n\nPick a test point, say \\(x = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\frac{2(2) - 1}{2 - 1} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{4 - 1}{1} \\right| = |3| = 3\n\\]\n\nComparison:\n\n\\[\n3 > 2 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis works as well! The inequality is satisfied in this interval.\n\n**Check:**\n\nQuick check: The absolute value is 3, which is greater than 2. This is expected.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Final Reflection and Solution**\n\nBased on the interval testing, the inequality \\(\\left| \\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1} \\right| > 2\\) holds true in the intervals:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{( \\frac{3}{4}, 1 ) \\cup ( 1, \\infty )}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Interval 1:** \\( (-\\infty, \\frac{3}{4}) \\) \u2014 The inequality is not satisfied.\n- **Interval 2:** \\( (\\frac{3}{4}, 1) \\) \u2014 The inequality is satisfied.\n- **Interval 3:** \\( (1, \\infty) \\) \u2014 The inequality is satisfied.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- Breaking the absolute value inequality into cases is essential for properly handling the absolute value.\n- Testing intervals on a number line ensures that all possible solutions are considered while avoiding undefined points.\n- Quick checks after each step help in verifying the correctness of the approach.\n\n**Reflection Throughout:**\n\n- Initially, I thought both cases would yield solutions, but one led to a contradiction, highlighting the importance of checking assumptions.\n- Considering the denominator restriction early prevented potential mistakes in the solution set.\n- The interval testing method provided a clear and systematic way to determine the solution set, ensuring that all scenarios were covered.\n\nOverall, approaching the problem methodically by brainstorming strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying each part led to the correct solution.",
