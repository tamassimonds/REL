    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's make it as natural and human-like as possible.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first glance at the equation \\( z^2 = 12z - 7 \\), I immediately think, \"This looks like a quadratic equation.\" Quadratic equations are usually in the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), and I recognize that I need to rearrange this equation to fit that mold.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure if that's the best path. Maybe there are other methods I could explore, like factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let me brainstorm:\n\n- **Option 1**: **Rearrange to Standard Form** \u2013 Move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero.\n- **Option 2**: **Factoring** \u2013 See if the quadratic can be factored easily.\n- **Option 3**: **Quadratic Formula** \u2013 Use the formula to find the roots directly.\n- **Option 4**: **Completing the Square** \u2013 Transform the equation by completing the square.\n\nAt first, rearranging to standard form seems like a straightforward starting point. If that leads me to a dead end, I can try factoring or the quadratic formula. But let's start by moving all terms to one side.\n\n### **Step 1: Rearranging the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process**:  \nI want to get all the terms on one side to see if it resembles the standard quadratic form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\). This should make it easier to identify the coefficients.\n\n**Action**:  \nSubtract \\( 12z \\) and add \\( 7 \\) to both sides to bring everything to the left:\n\n\\[\nz^2 - 12z + 7 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflecting**:  \nOkay, that looks like a standard quadratic equation now. I have \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -12 \\), and \\( c = 7 \\). This feels like a good starting point.\n\n### **Step 2: Considering Factoring**\n\n**Thought Process**:  \nBefore jumping into the quadratic formula, maybe I can factor the equation. Factoring can sometimes make things simpler if the numbers allow it. Let me think if there are two numbers that multiply to \\( 7 \\) (the constant term) and add up to \\( -12 \\) (the coefficient of \\( z \\)).\n\n**Action**:  \nLooking for pairs that multiply to \\( 7 \\):\n- \\( 1 \\times 7 = 7 \\)\n- \\( -1 \\times -7 = 7 \\)\n- \\( 7 \\times 1 = 7 \\)\n- \\( -7 \\times -1 = 7 \\)\n\n**Check**:  \nWait, none of these pairs add up to \\( -12 \\). The closest is \\( -1 \\) and \\( -7 \\), which add to \\( -8 \\), not \\( -12 \\).\n\n**Reflecting**:  \nHmm, that means factoring might not be straightforward here. Perhaps I should move on to the quadratic formula.\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process**:  \nSince factoring doesn't seem viable, let's use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nThis should give me the roots directly. I need to plug in \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -12 \\), and \\( c = 7 \\).\n\n**Action**:  \nCalculating step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( b^2 - 4ac \\)**:\n\n   \\[\n   (-12)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 7 = 144 - 28 = 116\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the formula**:\n\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{116}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify \\( \\sqrt{116} \\)**:\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{116} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 29} = 2\\sqrt{29}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final expression for \\( z \\)**:\n\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{12 \\pm 2\\sqrt{29}}{2} = 6 \\pm \\sqrt{29}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflecting**:  \nWait a minute, that gives me two values for \\( z \\): \\( 6 + \\sqrt{29} \\) and \\( 6 - \\sqrt{29} \\). I need to find the **sum** of all values of \\( z \\). So I should add these two together.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Sum of \\( z \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process**:  \nI have two solutions for \\( z \\): \\( 6 + \\sqrt{29} \\) and \\( 6 - \\sqrt{29} \\). To find the sum, I simply add them together.\n\n**Action**:  \nAdding the two solutions:\n\n\\[\n(6 + \\sqrt{29}) + (6 - \\sqrt{29}) = 6 + \\sqrt{29} + 6 - \\sqrt{29} = 12\n\\]\n\n**Reflecting**:  \nSurprisingly, the \\( \\sqrt{29} \\) terms cancel out, leaving me with just \\( 12 \\). That seems neat. But let me double-check to ensure everything adds up correctly.\n\n### **Step 5: Quick Check**\n\n**Thought Process**:  \nThis cancellation seems too neat to be a coincidence. Let me verify by considering the properties of quadratic equations. According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of \\( az^2 + bz + c = 0 \\) is \\( -\\frac{b}{a} \\). Here, \\( b = -12 \\) and \\( a = 1 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of roots} = -\\frac{-12}{1} = 12\n\\]\n\n**Action**:  \nConfirming the sum using Vieta's:\n\n\\[\n12 \\quad \\text{(matches our calculation)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflecting**:  \nThis aligns perfectly with our earlier calculation. It reassures me that the sum of the roots being \\( 12 \\) is correct. The quadratic formula method worked well here.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorming**: Initially considered rearranging, factoring, and using the quadratic formula.\n- **Exploration**: Started with rearranging to standard form, then attempted factoring but realized it wouldn't work easily.\n- **Reflection**: Transitioned to the quadratic formula, computed the roots, and successfully found the sum.\n- **Checking**: Used Vieta's formulas to verify the sum of the roots, confirming that the answer makes sense.\n\nIn conclusion, the sum of all values of \\( z \\) satisfying the equation \\( z^2 = 12z - 7 \\) is **12**.",
