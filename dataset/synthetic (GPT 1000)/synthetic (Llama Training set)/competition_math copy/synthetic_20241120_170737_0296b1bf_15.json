    "working_out": "## Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, looking at the problem, I see we have two equations involving \\( j \\) and \\( k \\):\n\n1. \\( 5j - 42k = 1 \\)\n2. \\( 2k - j = 3 \\)\n\nFirst off, this reminds me of solving systems of linear equations, which is something I've tackled before. There are a few methods I could use:\n\n1. **Substitution Method**: Solve one equation for one variable and then substitute that into the other.\n2. **Elimination Method**: Align the equations to eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting them.\n3. **Graphical Method**: Graph both equations and find their intersection point.\n4. **Matrix Method**: Use matrices and determinants, but that feels a bit advanced for now.\n\nHmm, at first glance, the **Substitution Method** seems straightforward because the second equation can easily be rearranged. But then again, the **Elimination Method** might work well too since both equations are already in a linear form. Let\u2019s explore both and see which feels more natural.\n\n## Exploring the Substitution Method\n\n### Step 1: Solve the Second Equation for \\( j \\)\n\nThinking about it, if I can express \\( j \\) in terms of \\( k \\), then I can substitute that into the first equation. Let\u2019s try that.\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n\\[\n2k - j = 3\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( j \\), I\u2019ll add \\( j \\) to both sides and subtract 3 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2k - 3 = j\n\\]\n\nSo, \n\n\\[\nj = 2k - 3\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nAlright, that seems correct. Now, I have \\( j \\) expressed in terms of \\( k \\). Let\u2019s move on to the next step.\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\( j = 2k - 3 \\) into the First Equation\n\nNow, I\u2019ll take this expression for \\( j \\) and substitute it into the first equation:\n\n\\[\n5(2k - 3) - 42k = 1\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s distribute the \\( 5 \\):\n\n\\[\n10k - 15 - 42k = 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine Like Terms\n\nNow, I\u2019ll combine the \\( k \\) terms:\n\n\\[\n10k - 42k - 15 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n-32k - 15 = 1\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nWait, that number \\(-32k\\) seems a bit large, but I think the calculation is correct. Let\u2019s proceed.\n\n### Step 4: Isolate \\( k \\)\n\nI need to solve for \\( k \\), so I\u2019ll add \\( 15 \\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\n-32k = 1 + 15\n\\]\n\\[\n-32k = 16\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by \\(-32\\):\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{16}{-32} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Check\n\nHmm, \\( k = -\\frac{1}{2} \\). Let me quickly verify: \\( 16 \\div -32 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\). That seems correct.\n\n### Step 5: Substitute \\( k = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) Back to Find \\( j \\)\n\nNow, I\u2019ll substitute \\( k \\) back into the equation \\( j = 2k - 3 \\):\n\n\\[\nj = 2 \\times -\\frac{1}{2} - 3\n\\]\n\\[\nj = -1 - 3\n\\]\n\\[\nj = -4\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nSo, \\( j = -4 \\) and \\( k = -\\frac{1}{2} \\). Let me double-check if these values satisfy both original equations.\n\n## Quick Check with the Original Equations\n\n**First Equation:**\n\\[\n5j - 42k = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n5 \\times -4 - 42 \\times -\\frac{1}{2} = -20 + 21 = 1 \\quad \\checkmark\n\\]\n\n**Second Equation:**\n\\[\n2k - j = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\times -\\frac{1}{2} - (-4) = -1 + 4 = 3 \\quad \\checkmark\n\\]\n\nBoth equations are satisfied. Cool, it looks like the substitution method worked out well.\n\n## Exploring the Elimination Method\n\nJust for practice, let\u2019s see how the **Elimination Method** would work.\n\n### Step 1: Align the Equations\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n1. \\( 5j - 42k = 1 \\)\n2. \\( 2k - j = 3 \\)\n\nMaybe I should multiply the second equation to align \\( j \\) terms. Let\u2019s multiply the entire second equation by \\(-5\\) to align the \\( j \\) coefficients:\n\n\\[\n-5(2k - j) = -5(3)\n\\]\n\\[\n-10k + 5j = -15\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Add the Modified Second Equation to the First\n\nNow, add this modified equation to the first equation:\n\n\\[\n(5j - 42k) + (5j - 10k) = 1 + (-15)\n\\]\n\\[\n10j - 52k = -14\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Let's see if simplifying helps.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Equation\n\nMaybe I can divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:\n\n\\[\n5j - 26k = -7\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Use the Simplified Second Equation\n\nNow, let's use the simplified second equation along with the original first equation:\n\nOriginal First Equation: \n\\[\n5j - 42k = 1\n\\]\n\nSimplified Second Equation:\n\\[\n5j - 26k = -7\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Subtract the Simplified Second Equation from the First\n\n\\[\n(5j - 42k) - (5j - 26k) = 1 - (-7)\n\\]\n\\[\n-42k + 26k = 1 + 7\n\\]\n\\[\n-16k = 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( k \\)\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{8}{-16} = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Find \\( j \\)\n\nNow, substitute \\( k = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) back into one of the original equations. Let's use the second one:\n\n\\[\n2(-\\frac{1}{2}) - j = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n-1 - j = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n-j = 3 + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n-j = 4\n\\]\n\\[\nj = -4\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nSo, using the elimination method, I also arrived at \\( j = -4 \\) and \\( k = -\\frac{1}{2} \\). This confirms that both methods are valid and lead to the same solution.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nBoth the **Substitution Method** and the **Elimination Method** worked to find the solution \\( (j, k) = (-4, -\\frac{1}{2}) \\). Initially, I leaned towards substitution because it seemed straightforward, but verifying with elimination ensured the correctness of the solution.\n\nThroughout the process, checking each step helped catch any potential mistakes early. Reflecting on whether each method was correctly applied allowed for smooth problem-solving and confirmed the final answer.\n\nBy exploring multiple strategies and verifying results, I confidently arrived at the correct ordered pair: \n\n\\[\n(j, k) = (-4, -\\frac{1}{2})\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "We can multiply the second equation by 5, so that our equations are \\begin{align*}\n5j -42k &=1\\text{, and} \\\\\n-5j +10k &=15. \\end{align*}Summing these equations gives $-32k=16$, so $k=-16/32=-1/2$.
