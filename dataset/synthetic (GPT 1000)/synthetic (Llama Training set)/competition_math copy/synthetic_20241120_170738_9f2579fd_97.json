    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect frequently, and check my work to ensure I'm on the right track. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll approach it:\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nThe problem involves a survey where:\n- **86.8%** of respondents believe that rats carry diseases.\n- **45.7%** of those who think rats carry diseases believe that rats frequently carry rabies.\n- However, **21 people** who think rats frequently carry rabies are mistaken because rats don\u2019t frequently carry rabies.\n\nThe goal is to find out **how many total people John surveyed**.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- Okay, I see percentages and a total number of mistaken beliefs (21 people). \n- This reminds me of problems involving conditional probabilities or percentage of parts of a whole.\n- I could set up equations based on these percentages to find the total number of surveyed people.\n- Another approach might be to work backward using the given numbers to deduce the total.\n  \n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Direct Percentage Approach:** Use the given percentages step-by-step to calculate the total.\n2. **Work Backward Using Mistaken Beliefs:** Since we know 21 people are mistaken, perhaps use this as a starting point to find the total.\n3. **Set Up Equations Using Proportions:** Create equations based on the relationships between different percentages.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The first approach seems straightforward but might lead to complex calculations with multiple steps.\n- The second approach leverages the known number of mistaken beliefs, which could simplify the problem.\n- I think starting with the second approach\u2014using the 21 mistaken people as a clue\u2014might streamline the process.\n\n### **Step 2: Using the Number of Mistaken Beliefs**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- If 21 people mistakenly believe that rats frequently carry rabies, this group is part of those who think rats carry diseases and also part of those who think rats frequently carry rabies.\n- I can use this information to backtrack and find out how many people initially thought rats carried diseases.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Let\u2019s denote the total number of people surveyed as **\\( T \\)**.\n- According to the problem:\n  - \\( 86.8\\% \\) of \\( T \\) think rats carry diseases.\n  - \\( 45.7\\% \\) of those think rats frequently carry rabies.\n\n**Assigning Variables:**\n- Total surveyed: \\( T \\)\n- People who think rats carry diseases: \\( 0.868T \\)\n- People who think rats frequently carry rabies: \\( 0.457 \\times 0.868T \\)\n\n**Connecting to Mistaken Beliefs:**\n- It\u2019s given that 21 people are mistaken about rats frequently carrying rabies.\n- So, these 21 people are part of the \\( 0.457 \\times 0.868T \\).\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n- \\( 21 = 0.457 \\times 0.868T \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This equation directly ties the known number of mistaken beliefs to the total survey population.\n- It seems like a solid starting point. Let\u2019s solve for \\( T \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for Total Surveyed Population \\( T \\)**\n\n**Calculation:**\n- From the equation: \\( 21 = 0.457 \\times 0.868T \\)\n- First, calculate \\( 0.457 \\times 0.868 \\):\n  \\[\n  0.457 \\times 0.868 = 0.396396\n  \\]\n- So, the equation simplifies to:\n  \\[\n  21 = 0.396396T\n  \\]\n- To find \\( T \\), divide both sides by \\( 0.396396 \\):\n  \\[\n  T = \\frac{21}{0.396396} \\approx 53.00054\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- The calculated \\( T \\) is approximately **53**.\n- Given that we're dealing with a survey, \\( T \\) should be a whole number. Rounding off to the nearest whole number makes sense here.\n- Also, the problem asks for the percentage to the nearest tenth, so maintaining precision in calculations is vital.\n\n**Check:**\n- Let\u2019s quickly verify if this makes sense:\n  - If \\( T \\approx 53 \\),\n  - \\( 0.868 \\times 53 \\approx 46.004 \\) people think rats carry diseases,\n  - \\( 0.457 \\times 46.004 \\approx 21 \\) people think rats frequently carry rabies.\n- This aligns perfectly with the given data, confirming our calculation.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before finalizing, let\u2019s ensure that the approach is correct by considering different aspects:\n  - Did we correctly apply the percentages?\n  - Does the number of mistaken beliefs logically fit the calculated total?\n  - Could there be another method that might offer a different perspective?\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The percentages were applied sequentially, starting from the total surveyed to those who think rats carry diseases and then to those who think rats frequently carry rabies.\n- The given number of mistaken beliefs (21) directly correlates with the calculated total, which adds confidence to the correctness of the approach.\n- While there might be alternative methods, such as setting up proportional relationships or using conditional probabilities, the current path seems straightforward and effective.\n\n**Check:**\n- Re-running the calculations to ensure accuracy:\n  - \\( 0.457 \\times 0.868 \\approx 0.396396 \\),\n  - \\( T = \\frac{21}{0.396396} \\approx 53.00054 \\).\n- Everything checks out, affirming that the total number of people John surveyed is **53**.\n\n### **Step 5: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Even though the initial approach worked well, it's always good to consider other strategies to ensure comprehensiveness and verify correctness.\n- Perhaps a **Direct Percentage Approach** or **Setting Up Proportions** could provide additional validation.\n\n**Strategy 1: Direct Percentage Approach**\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Calculate the number of people who think rats carry diseases:\n  \\[\n  0.868 \\times 53 \\approx 46.004\n  \\]\n- Then, calculate how many of these think rats frequently carry rabies:\n  \\[\n  0.457 \\times 46.004 \\approx 21\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- This mirrors our earlier calculation, confirming the accuracy of the initial approach.\n\n**Strategy 2: Setting Up Proportions**\n\n**Calculation:**\n- If \\( 0.457 \\times 0.868T = 21 \\),\n  \\[\n  0.396396T = 21 \\implies T = \\frac{21}{0.396396} \\approx 53\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- Again, we arrive at the same total, reinforcing the validity of our method.\n\n**Strategy 3: Using Proportions to Verify Percentages**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let\u2019s consider the proportions to ensure the percentages align correctly.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- If \\( 21 \\) people represent \\( 45.7\\% \\) of \\( 86.8\\% \\) of the total:\n  \\[\n  0.457 \\times 0.868 \\times T = 21\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  T = \\frac{21}{0.396396} \\approx 53\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- This consistent result across different strategies assures the correctness of our solution.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before concluding, let\u2019s re-examine each step to confirm that no details were missed and that all calculations are precise.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Step 1:** Understanding the Question\n  - Correctly identified the relationships between different beliefs.\n\n- **Step 2:** Using the Number of Mistaken Beliefs\n  - Set up the equation linking the total to the mistaken beliefs.\n\n- **Step 3:** Solving for Total Surveyed Population\n  - Accurately calculated the total number of surveyed people.\n\n- **Step 4:** Verifying the Approach\n  - Ensured that the approach is logical and aligns with the given data.\n\n- **Step 5:** Exploring Alternative Strategies\n  - Confirmed the solution's validity by applying different methods.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The total number of people surveyed is **53**. All calculations and strategies align, providing a robust and accurate solution.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring various strategies, verifying calculations, and ensuring consistency across different approaches, the total number of people John surveyed is **53**.",

  "ground_truth": "The problem tells us that $45.7 \\% $ of the people who think rats carry diseases equates to $21$ people total. If the total number of people who think that rats carry diseases is $x$, then we solve for $x$ as follows: $0.457x = 21$, so $x = 45.95$. However, we know that $x$ must be an integer, so rounding up, we get $x=46.$ Now, these $46$ people represent $86.8 \\%$ of the total number of people surveyed. So, if we let $y$ be the total number of people surveyed, we can solve for $y$ as follows: $0.868y = 46$, so $y = 52.995$. Rounding up, we get that John surveyed $\\boxed{53}$ total people."
