    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: Compute \\(\\arcsin \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) and express the answer in radians. I'll brainstorm some strategies, reflect and check my work throughout, just like how a human would tackle it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I see \\(\\arcsin \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\), it reminds me of trigonometric values I might have encountered before, particularly with special angles in the unit circle. I recall that \\(\\arcsin\\) refers to the inverse sine function, which gives the angle whose sine is the given value.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Method 1:** Recall known values of sine for special angles in the unit circle.\n- **Method 2:** Use a right triangle approach to find the angle.\n- **Method 3:** Utilize the Pythagorean identity to derive the angle.\n\n**Wait a minute...**  \nI think Method 1 might be the quickest since I remember that \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) corresponds to a common angle. But let me explore all options to ensure I'm covering everything.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Method 1: Recall Known Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI remember that the sine of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) radians (or 45 degrees) is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\). This seems to match our given value.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes \\(\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\)?  \n**Reflection:**  \nYes, I remember that from the unit circle. This might be the correct angle we're looking for.\n\n**Method 2: Right Triangle Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf I don't recall the angle directly, I could draw a right triangle where the sine of the angle is \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\). In a 45-45-90 triangle, both legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Let\u2019s say both legs are of length 1.\n- Hypotenuse: \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}\\)\n- So, \\(\\sin 45^\\circ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis method also points to 45 degrees or \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) radians.\n\n**Method 3: Pythagorean Identity**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI could use the Pythagorean identity:  \n\\(\\sin^2(\\theta) + \\cos^2(\\theta) = 1\\)  \nGiven \\(\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\), let's find \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 + \\cos^2(\\theta) = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\cos^2(\\theta) = 1 \\\\\n\\cos^2(\\theta) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\pm\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n    \n**Wait...**  \nSince we're dealing with \\(\\arcsin\\), which restricts the angle to \\([- \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]\\), \\(\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) makes sense.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis also leads me to \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) radians.\n\n**Check:**  \nAll methods converge to the same angle, \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\). This gives me confidence that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFrom all the strategies explored, \\(\\arcsin \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) radians.\n\n**Checking:**  \nLet me quickly verify:  \n- \\(\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- All methods consistently point to \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. Using multiple approaches helped confirm the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy exploring different methods\u2014recalling known values, applying the right triangle concept, and using the Pythagorean identity\u2014I ensured a comprehensive understanding and verification of the problem. Initially, recalling the sine value of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) helped me quickly identify the correct angle, but reflecting and checking with alternative strategies reinforced the accuracy. It's always beneficial to consider multiple approaches, especially when starting with a familiar hint, to ensure the solution is robust.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(\\arcsin \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians}\\)",
