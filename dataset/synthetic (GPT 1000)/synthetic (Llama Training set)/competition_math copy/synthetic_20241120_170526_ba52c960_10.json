    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking the natural thought process a human would use. I'll brainstorm, reflect, check my work along the way, and adjust strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n\n- Okay, I see, **Juan** is performing a series of operations on an initial number. \n- The operations are: **adding 2, multiplying by 2, subtracting 2, and dividing by 2**.\n- After doing all these steps, the result is **7**.\n- I need to figure out what the **original number** was.\n\nThis looks like a **stepwise transformation** of a number, which reminds me of working with **equations and inverse operations**. It seems like I need to **backtrack** from the final answer to find the original number.\n\nBut wait, let me brainstorm different strategies to ensure I'm on the right path.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Work Backwards Using Inverse Operations:**\n   - Start from the final result and apply the inverse of each operation step-by-step to trace back to the original number.\n   \n2. **Set Up an Algebraic Equation:**\n   - Define the original number as a variable (e.g., \\( x \\)) and set up an equation based on the given operations to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Check with Plugging in Values:**\n   - Although the final answer is provided, I could theoretically test with sample numbers to see if the operations hold true, but this might not be efficient here.\n\nReflection:\n\n- Considering the **stepwise nature** of the problem, the **first two strategies** seem most logical.\n- **Plugging in values** as a verification step could come later to ensure correctness.\n- I'll start with **working backwards** because it aligns well with the operations described.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Inverse of Each Operation**\n\n**Operation 4: Divide by 2**\n\n- Given Final Answer: **7**\n- Before this step, the number was multiplied by 2. So, to find the number before this operation, I'll multiply **7 by 2**.\n  \n  \\[\n  7 \\times 2 = 14\n  \\]\n\n**Check:** Does doubling 7 make sense? Yes, because the previous step was dividing by 2, so doubling is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Operation 3: Subtract 2**\n\n- Now, take **14** and add back **2** (since subtracting 2 was the previous operation).\n  \n  \\[\n  14 + 2 = 16\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Adding 2 back makes sense because we need to reverse the subtraction step.\n\n---\n\n**Operation 2: Multiply by 2**\n\n- Take **16** and divide by **2** (to reverse the multiplication).\n  \n  \\[\n  16 \\div 2 = 8\n  \\]\n\n**Check:** Dividing 16 by 2 seems right since the original step was multiplying by 2.\n\n---\n\n**Operation 1: Add 2**\n\n- Finally, take **8** and subtract **2** (to reverse the addition).\n  \n  \\[\n  8 - 2 = 6\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Subtracting 2 from 8 aligns with the initial operation of adding 2.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verification of the Process**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Let's run through the operations starting from the supposed original number **6** to see if we end up at **7**.\n\n  1. **Add 2:** \\( 6 + 2 = 8 \\)\n  2. **Multiply by 2:** \\( 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\)\n  3. **Subtract 2:** \\( 16 - 2 = 14 \\)\n  4. **Divide by 2:** \\( 14 \\div 2 = 7 \\)\n\n**Result:** Yep, starting from **6**, I end up at **7**, which matches the given final answer.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This confirms that the original number is indeed **6**. The stepwise reversal works perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Setting Up an Algebraic Equation**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- Although working backwards was intuitive, I can also set up an equation to solidify the solution.\n\n**Defining the Equation:**\n\n1. Let\u2019s define the original number as **\\( x \\)**.\n2. Following Juan's steps, we can write:\n   \n   - **Add 2:** \\( x + 2 \\)\n   - **Multiply by 2:** \\( 2(x + 2) \\)\n   - **Subtract 2:** \\( 2(x + 2) - 2 \\)\n   - **Divide by 2:** \\( \\frac{2(x + 2) - 2}{2} \\)\n\n3. Set this equal to the final answer **7**:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{2(x + 2) - 2}{2} = 7\n   \\]\n\n**Solving the Equation:**\n\n1. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n   \n   \\[\n   2(x + 2) - 2 = 14\n   \\]\n\n2. Add 2 to both sides:\n   \n   \\[\n   2(x + 2) = 16\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 2:\n   \n   \\[\n   x + 2 = 8\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract 2 from both sides:\n   \n   \\[\n   x = 6\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This algebraic approach also gives me the same original number, **6**.\n- It's always good to verify using a different method to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- Both methods\u2014working backwards and setting up an equation\u2014led me to the same solution: the original number is **6**.\n- The step-by-step reversal aligned perfectly with the operations described, and the equation method confirmed it.\n- Regular checks and reflections ensured that each part of the process was correct and consistent.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\n- **Brainstorming and reflecting** throughout the problem helped in selecting the most effective strategies.\n- **Checking work** after each step ensured accuracy and built confidence in the solution.\n- Approaching the problem **from different angles** confirmed the correctness of the answer.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed, human-like thinking process aligns with what you're looking for!",
