    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem by approaching it as a brainstorming session. I\u2019ll explore different strategies, reflect often to ensure correctness, and adjust my methods as needed\u2014just like how I would tackle a problem in real life.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Question Recap:**  \nWe need to find the value of \\( p - q \\) where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are the two distinct solutions to the equation  \n\\[\n\\frac{4x - 12}{x^2 + 2x - 15} = x + 2.\n\\]  \nGiven that \\( p > q \\), we\u2019re looking for the difference between the larger and smaller solution.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**  \n- **Fraction Equation:** This reminds me of solving rational equations where the variable is in both numerator and denominator.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Cross-Multiplication:** Clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by the denominator.\n  2. **Combine Like Terms:** Simplify the equation after clearing the fraction to form a polynomial equation.\n  3. **Factoring:** Once in polynomial form, factor the equation to find the roots.\n  4. **Quadratic Formula:** If factoring doesn\u2019t work or is messy, use the quadratic formula to find the solutions.\n- **Reflection:** Cross-multiplication seems like a straightforward starting point to eliminate the fraction.\n\n**Next Steps:**  \nLet\u2019s try **cross-multiplication** to simplify the equation. If this doesn\u2019t lead us in the right direction, I\u2019ll reconsider and try another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Cross-Multiply to Eliminate the Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBy cross-multiplying, we can eliminate the denominator and deal with a polynomial equation, which is typically easier to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n4x - 12 = (x + 2)(x^2 + 2x - 15)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, this looks like a valid approach. Now, I need to expand the right side and bring everything to one side of the equation to set it to zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expand the Right Side**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s distribute \\( (x + 2) \\) across \\( (x^2 + 2x - 15) \\). This should give us a quadratic equation after moving all terms to one side.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n4x - 12 = x(x^2 + 2x - 15) + 2(x^2 + 2x - 15)\n\\]\n\\[\n4x - 12 = x^3 + 2x^2 - 15x + 2x^2 + 4x - 30\n\\]\n\\[\n4x - 12 = x^3 + 4x^2 - 15x - 15\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute\u2014this seems a bit messy. Let\u2019s double-check the distribution:\n\n\\[\nx(x^2 + 2x - 15) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 15x  \n2(x^2 + 2x - 15) = 2x^2 + 4x - 30  \n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nAdding those together gives:\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 4x^2 - 15x + 2x^2 + 4x - 30 = x^3 + 4x^2 - 11x - 30\n\\]\n\nOh no! **Mistake Alert:** I added incorrectly. Let me correct that:\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 2x^2 - 15x + 2x^2 + 4x - 30 = x^3 + 4x^2 - 11x - 30\n\\]\n\nCorrecting my earlier step:\n\n\\[\n4x - 12 = x^3 + 4x^2 - 11x - 30\n\\]\n\n**Clarification:**  \nBringing all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n0 = x^3 + 4x^2 - 15x - 18  \\quad \\text{(by subtracting \\(4x - 12\\) from both sides)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow, the equation is set to zero, which is good. But looking at the coefficients, this cubic equation might be tricky to factor directly. It might be helpful to see if there\u2019s a simpler way to handle it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Consider Factoring the Polynomial**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s see if this cubic equation can be factored. If there\u2019s an obvious factor, that would make finding the roots easier.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nThe equation is:\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 4x^2 - 15x - 18 = 0\n\\]\n\nBut factoring cubics can be challenging. Maybe looking for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem could help. The possible rational roots are divisors of the constant term (-18) divided by divisors of the leading coefficient (1).\n\n**Possible Rational Roots:**  \n\u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b16, \u00b19, \u00b118\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGiven that cubics can have up to three real roots, and we know there are two distinct solutions, perhaps one of these is a rational root. Let\u2019s test a few to see if they work.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Test Possible Rational Roots**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s quickly test some of the possible rational roots to see if any satisfy the equation.\n\n**Testing \\( x = 1 \\):**\n\n\\[\n1^3 + 4(1)^2 - 15(1) - 18 = 1 + 4 - 15 - 18 = -28 \\quad (\\text{Not a root})\n\\]\n\n**Testing \\( x = -1 \\):**\n\n\\[\n(-1)^3 + 4(-1)^2 - 15(-1) - 18 = -1 + 4 + 15 - 18 = 0 \\quad (\\text{Root Found})\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAwesome! \\( x = -1 \\) is a root. This means \\( x + 1 \\) is a factor of the cubic equation. Let\u2019s use this to factor the polynomial.\n\n**Next Steps:**  \nSince \\( x = -1 \\) is a root, we can factor the cubic equation by dividing it by \\( x + 1 \\). This will give us a quadratic equation, making it easier to find the other root.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Factor the Cubic Equation by \\( x + 1 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nDividing the cubic by \\( x + 1 \\) will leave us with a quadratic equation. Then, we can use the quadratic formula to find the remaining roots.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nPerform synthetic division or polynomial long division.\n\n**Using Synthetic Division:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n-1 & 1 & 4 & -15 & -18 \\\\\n   &   & -1 & -3 & 18 \\\\\n\\hline\n   & 1 & 3 & -18 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Result:**  \n\\[\nx^3 + 4x^2 - 15x - 18 = (x + 1)(x^2 + 3x - 18)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nPerfect! Now, we have the cubic factored into \\( (x + 1)(x^2 + 3x - 18) = 0 \\). This makes it much easier to find the remaining roots by solving the quadratic equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Solve the Quadratic Equation \\( x^2 + 3x - 18 = 0 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that we have the quadratic equation, we can solve for \\( x \\) using factoring, the quadratic formula, or completing the square. Let\u2019s see if it factors nicely first.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-18\\) (constant term) and add up to \\(3\\) (coefficient of \\( x \\)).\n\n**Possible Pairs:**  \n- \\(-1\\) and \\(18\\) \u2192 \\( -1 + 18 = 17 \\)\n- \\(-2\\) and \\(9\\) \u2192 \\( -2 + 9 = 7 \\)\n- \\(-3\\) and \\(6\\) \u2192 \\( -3 + 6 = 3 \\) \u2705\n\n**Factoring the Quadratic:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 3x - 18 = (x - 3)(x + 6) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\nx - 3 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 3  \nx + 6 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGreat! We have two solutions from the quadratic: \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -6 \\). Remembering that \\( x = -1 \\) was also a root of the cubic, these must be the other two roots. But wait, the problem states there are only two distinct solutions. This seems contradictory at first, but perhaps \\( x = -1 \\) is extraneous, or we miscounted.\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, let's reconsider. The cubic factored into \\( (x + 1)(x^2 + 3x - 18) \\), so \\( x = -1 \\) is indeed a solution. The quadratic gives us \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -6 \\). This means our original equation has three solutions: \\( x = -1, 3, -6 \\). However, the problem specifies only two distinct solutions, which suggests that one of these might be extraneous or that the problem is misquoted.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBut according to the steps, all three are valid solutions to the cubic equation. Perhaps the problem intends for us to only consider the real solutions or there's additional context missing.\n\n**Next Steps:**  \nGiven this ambiguity, I'll proceed with the solutions obtained but keep an eye out for possible extraneous roots during verification.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verify the Solutions in the Original Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIt's essential to substitute each solution back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it. This will help identify any extraneous roots.\n\n**Checking \\( x = 3 \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4(3) - 12}{3^2 + 2(3) - 15} = 3 + 2  \n\\frac{12 - 12}{9 + 6 - 15} = 5  \n\\frac{0}{0} = 5  \\quad \\text{(Undefined)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, this is problematic. \\( \\frac{0}{0} \\) is undefined, meaning \\( x = 3 \\) is not a valid solution for the original equation. This suggests that \\( x = 3 \\) might be an extraneous root introduced by the factoring process.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSo, \\( x = 3 \\) is not a solution to the original equation.\n\n**Checking \\( x = -6 \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4(-6) - 12}{(-6)^2 + 2(-6) - 15} = -6 + 2  \n\\frac{-24 - 12}{36 - 12 - 15} = -4  \n\\frac{-36}{9} = -4  \n\\]\n\\[\n-4 = -4 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\\( x = -6 \\) satisfies the original equation, so it's a valid solution.\n\n**Checking \\( x = -1 \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4(-1) - 12}{(-1)^2 + 2(-1) - 15} = -1 + 2  \n\\frac{-4 - 12}{1 - 2 - 15} = 1  \n\\frac{-16}{-16} = 1  \n\\]\n\\[\n1 = 1 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n\\( x = -1 \\) also satisfies the original equation, so it's valid.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe valid solutions are \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = -6 \\). \\( x = 3 \\) is extraneous.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Determine \\( p \\) and \\( q \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nGiven that \\( p > q \\), we need to assign the appropriate values to \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n**Solutions Found:**  \n\\[\nx = -1, \\quad x = -6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSince \\( -1 > -6 \\), we can assign:\n\n\\[\np = -1, \\quad q = -6\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThis aligns with the condition \\( p > q \\), so it makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Calculate \\( p - q \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, simply subtract \\( q \\) from \\( p \\) to find the required difference.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\np - q = (-1) - (-6) = -1 + 6 = 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe difference \\( p - q = 5 \\) seems reasonable. Let\u2019s do a quick check to ensure all steps led correctly here.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Quick Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s briefly revisit the key steps to ensure the correctness of the solution.\n\n1. **Cross-Multiplication:** Correctly eliminated the fraction.\n2. **Factoring the Cubic:** Identified \\( x = -1 \\) as a root; correctly factored the cubic.\n3. **Quadratic Solutions:** Found \\( x = -6 \\) as a valid solution; identified \\( x = 3 \\) as extraneous.\n4. **Assigning \\( p \\) and \\( q \\):** Correctly assigned \\( p = -1 \\) and \\( q = -6 \\).\n5. **Calculating \\( p - q \\):** Correct difference calculated.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll steps align logically, and the checks confirm that \\( p = -1 \\) and \\( q = -6 \\) are the correct solutions. The final answer \\( p - q = 5 \\) is consistent throughout.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough brainstorming and methodical checking, we determined that the distinct solutions to the original equation are \\( p = -1 \\) and \\( q = -6 \\). Therefore, the value of \\( p - q \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
