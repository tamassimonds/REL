This would help in identifying the vertex of the parabola, from which the focus can be determined.\n\n- **Given Equation:**  \n  \\( y = -3x^2 - 6x \\)\n\n- **Objective:**  \n  Rearrange it into the form \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\), where \\( (h, k) \\) is the vertex.\n\n- **First, Factor Out the Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):**  \n  Since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is negative (-3), I'll factor it out of the \\( x \\)-terms inside the equation.\n\n  \\[\n  y = -3(x^2 + 2x)\n  \\]\n\n- **Next, Complete the Square Inside the Parentheses:**  \n  To turn \\( x^2 + 2x \\) into a perfect square, I add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of \\( x \\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Half of } 2 = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 1^2 = 1\n  \\]\n\n  But adding 1 inside the parentheses, multiplied by -3 outside, changes the value. So, I need to subtract that effect to keep the equation balanced.\n\n  \\[\n  y = -3(x^2 + 2x + 1 - 1) = -3((x + 1)^2 - 1)\n  \\]\n\n  Simplifying this:\n\n  \\[\n  y = -3(x + 1)^2 + 3\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Hold on. Let me check if each step maintains the equality.\n\n  - Initially: \\( y = -3(x^2 + 2x) \\)\n  - After factoring out -3: \\( y = -3((x^2 + 2x) + 1 - 1) \\)\n  - Completed square: \\( y = -3((x + 1)^2 - 1) \\)\n  - Expanded: \\( y = -3(x + 1)^2 + 3 \\)\n\n  **Verification:**  \n  This seems correct because expanding \\( -3(x + 1)^2 + 3 \\) returns to the original equation:\n\n  \\[\n  -3(x^2 + 2x + 1) + 3 = -3x^2 - 6x - 3 + 3 = -3x^2 - 6x\n  \\]\n\n  So, the completion of the square was done correctly.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Vertex\n\n**Next Thought:**\n\nNow that I've rewritten the equation in vertex form \\( y = -3(x + 1)^2 + 3 \\), I can easily identify the vertex \\( (h, k) \\).\n\n- **Vertex:**  \n  From \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\), comparing, I have:\n  \n  \\[\n  h = -1, \\quad k = 3\n  \\]\n  \n  So, the vertex is \\( (-1, 3) \\).\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This makes sense because completing the square typically reveals the vertex directly. \n\n### Step 4: Determining the Focus\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the focus, I need to recall the properties of parabolas. The focus is a point located a certain distance from the vertex, along the axis of symmetry.\n\n- **Recall:**  \n  For a parabola in the form \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} \\, p = \\frac{1}{4|a|}\n  \\]\n  \n  This distance \\( p \\) determines how far the focus is from the vertex.\n\n- **Calculate \\( p \\):**\n  \n  Given \\( a = -3 \\):\n\n  \\[\n  p = \\frac{1}{4 \\times 3} = \\frac{1}{12}\n  \\]\n\n  **Note:**  \n  Since \\( a \\) is negative, the parabola opens downwards, so the focus will be \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) units below the vertex.\n\n- **Locate the Focus:**\n\n  Starting from the vertex \\( (-1, 3) \\), moving down \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\):\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Focus} = (-1, 3 - \\frac{1}{12}) = \\left(-1, \\frac{36}{12} - \\frac{1}{12}\\right) = \\left(-1, \\frac{35}{12}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**\n\n  Let me double-check the distance calculation:\n  \n  - \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) is indeed \\( \\frac{0.0833}{12} \\), which is approximately \\( 0.0833 \\).\n  - Subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) from 3 makes sense numerically.\n\n  This seems correct as all parts align logically.\n\n### Step 5: Finalizing the Answer\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nAfter completing the square, identifying the vertex, and calculating the focus distance, I've pinpointed the location of the focus.\n\n- **Final Answer:**\n\n  The focus of the parabola \\( y = -3x^2 - 6x \\) is at:\n\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{\\left(-1, \\frac{35}{12}\\right)}\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:**  \n  - **Does the vertex make sense?**  \n    Yes, \\( (-1, 3) \\) is a reasonable vertex for a downward-opening parabola.\n\n  - **Is the distance to the focus correct?**  \n    Yes, moving down \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) from the vertex aligns with the calculations.\n\n  - **Does the focus's position seem plausible?**  \n    Absolutely, located slightly below the vertex is expected for a parabola that opens downwards.\n\n### Ensuring Correctness\n\nThroughout the process, I made sure to verify each step:\n\n- **Completing the Square:**  \n  Confirmed that expanding the vertex form returned the original equation.\n\n- **Determining the Vertex:**  \n  Straightforward from the completed square form.\n\n- **Calculating the Focus:**  \n  Ensured the formula for \\( p \\) was applied correctly, considering the parabola's orientation.\n\n- **Final Calculation:**  \n  Checked that subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) from 3 was accurately reflected in the focus's y-coordinate.\n\nBy reflecting often and checking each part of the solution, I ensured that the approach was correct and that the final answer accurately represented the focus of the parabola.",

Completing the square on $x,$ we get\n\\[y = -3(x + 1)^2 + 3.\\]To make the algebra a bit easier, we can find the focus of the parabola $y = -3x^2,$ shift the parabola left by 1 unit to get $y = -3(x + 1)^2,$ and then shift it upward 3 units to find the focus of the parabola $y = -3(x + 1)^2 + 3.$\n\nSince the parabola $y = -3x^2$ is symmetric about the $y$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(0,f).$  Let $y = d$ be the equation of the directrix.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1.5 cm);\n\npair F, P, Q;\n\nF = (0,-1/4);\nP = (1,-1);\nQ = (1,1/4);\n\nreal parab (real x) {\n  return(-x^2);\n}\n\ndraw(graph(parab,-1.5,1.5),red);\ndraw((-1.5,1/4)--(1.5,1/4),dashed);\ndraw(P--F);\ndraw(P--Q);\n\ndot(\"$F$\", F, SW);\ndot(\"$P$\", P, E);\ndot(\"$Q$\", Q, N);\n[/asy]\n\nLet $(x,-3x^2)$ be a point on the parabola $y = -3x^2.$  Then\n\\[PF^2 = x^2 + (-3x^2 - f)^2\\]and $PQ^2 = (-3x^2 - d)^2.$  Thus,\n\\[x^2 + (-3x^2 - f)^2 = (-3x^2 - d)^2.\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[x^2 + 9x^4 + 6fx^2 + f^2 = 9x^4 + 6dx^2 + d^2.\\]Matching coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n1 + 6f &= 6d, \\\\\nf^2 &= d^2.\n\\end{align*}From the first equation, $d - f = \\frac{1}{6}.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $-2f = \\frac{1}{6},$ so $f = -\\frac{1}{12}.$\n\nThus, the focus of $y = -3x^2$ is $\\left( 0, -\\frac{1}{12} \\right),$ and the focus of $y = -3(x + 1)^2$ is $\\left( -1, -\\frac{1}{12} \\right),$ so the focus of $y = -3(x - 1)^2 + 3$ is $\\boxed{\\left( -1, \\frac{35}{12} \\right)}.$"
