    "working_out": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were working through it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and adjust my approach as needed. The goal is to think like a human, complete with exploring, checking, and possibly stumbling a bit along the way.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, I see an **annulus**, which is the area between two concentric circles. The key elements are:\n\n- **Radii of the circles**: \\( b \\) (larger) and \\( c \\) (smaller), with \\( b > c \\).\n- **Line segments**:\n  - \\( \\overline{OX} \\): Radius of the larger circle.\n  - \\( \\overline{XZ} \\): Tangent to the smaller circle at \\( Z \\).\n  - \\( \\overline{OY} \\): Radius of the larger circle containing \\( Z \\).\n- **Lengths**:\n  - \\( a = XZ \\)\n  - \\( d = YZ \\)\n  - \\( e = XY \\)\n\nThe question asks for the **area of the annulus** in terms of \\( \\pi \\) and at most one of these variables.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Basic Area Formula**: \n   - The area of the annulus is the difference between the areas of the two circles: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\pi b^2 - \\pi c^2 = \\pi (b^2 - c^2)\n     \\]\n   - But this doesn't incorporate \\( a, d, \\) or \\( e \\). Perhaps we need a relationship involving these lengths.\n\n2. **Right Triangle and Pythagorean Theorem**:\n   - The presence of tangents and radii suggests right triangles might be involved. \n   - Maybe the Pythagorean theorem can relate \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n3. **Similarity of Triangles**:\n   - Perhaps the triangles involved are similar, allowing us to set up proportional relationships.\n\n4. **Trigonometric Ratios**:\n   - Angles and tangents might bring trigonometry into play.\n\n### **Exploring the Right Triangle Strategy**\n\nLet me start with the **Pythagorean Theorem** approach, as right triangles seem likely with tangents and radii.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I know that a radius tangent to a circle creates a right angle with the tangent line at the point of tangency.\n- This gives me a right triangle involving \\( XZ \\), \\( OZ \\), and \\( OX \\).\n\n**Sketching the Triangle:**\n- Triangle \\( OXZ \\):\n  - \\( OX = b \\) (radius of the larger circle)\n  - \\( XZ = a \\) (tangent to the smaller circle)\n  - \\( OZ = c \\) (radius of the smaller circle)\n\n**Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n\\[\nOX^2 = OZ^2 + XZ^2 \\implies b^2 = c^2 + a^2\n\\]\n\\[\nb^2 = c^2 + a^2 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This equation connects \\( b, c, \\) and \\( a \\), which is good. \n- But I need to express the area in terms of \\( \\pi \\) and at most one of \\( a, d, \\( or \\( e \\). \n- **Wait**, the problem needs the area in terms of the circle's radii and possibly \\( a \\) only, but not both \\( b \\) and \\( c \\). Maybe I need to find another relationship.\n\n### **Checking the Approach**\n\n**Does this help?**\n- With \\( b^2 = c^2 + a^2 \\), I can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( c \\).\n- But I still have two variables (\\( a \\) and \\( c \\)) alongside \\( b \\), which might not align with the requirement to use at most one variable.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**\n- Maybe express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n  \\[\n  c^2 = b^2 - a^2 \\implies c = \\sqrt{b^2 - a^2}\n  \\]\n- However, introducing square roots might complicate things.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This doesn't seem to simplify the problem enough.\n- I should look for a different strategy.\n\n### **Exploring Similar Triangles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Maybe triangles within the annulus are similar, allowing for proportionate relationships.\n- If \\( \\triangle OXZ \\) is similar to \\( \\triangle OYZ \\), I might set up a ratio involving \\( a, d, \\) and \\( e \\).\n\n**Setting Up Similarity:**\n- **Wait**, for similarity, I need corresponding angles to be equal, which might not be the case here unless there's specific information about angles.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Without additional angle information, this approach doesn't seem viable.\n\n**Checking Again:**\n- I'm still stuck. Maybe another strategy is needed.\n\n### **Revisiting the Basic Area Formula with a New Idea**\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n- Start with the basic area formula for the annulus:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\pi (b^2 - c^2)\n  \\]\n- Use the relationship \\( b^2 = a^2 + c^2 \\) from the Pythagorean theorem to substitute for \\( b^2 - c^2 \\).\n\n**Substituting:**\n\\[\nb^2 - c^2 = a^2 \\implies \\text{Area} = \\pi a^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This simplifies beautifully! The area of the annulus is purely in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( \\pi \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\pi a^2\n\\]\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Does the answer make sense?**\n- **Dimensionally:** The area should have units of length squared, which \\( \\pi a^2 \\) provides.\n- **Conceptually:** This fits because the area of the annulus should depend on the tangent length \\( a \\) to the smaller circle, assuming \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) are consistent with the Pythagorean relationship.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- I'm confident that the area of the annulus is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\pi a^2}\n\\]\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Started** by exploring different strategies, initially attempting to apply the Pythagorean theorem.\n- **Realized** that while the theorem provided a relationship between \\( b, c, \\) and \\( a \\), it didn't directly simplify the area expression to the required form.\n- **Shifted** to considering the basic area formula for the annulus and substituted the Pythagorean relationship.\n- **Simplified** the expression to find that the area is solely dependent on \\( a \\) and \\( \\pi \\).\n- **Checked** the final result to ensure it makes sense dimensionally and conceptually.\n\nThis step-by-step exploration led to the conclusion that the area of the annulus is \\( \\pi a^2 \\).",
