    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking my work often, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving this on my own.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about finding the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle where the legs are 75 units and 100 units long.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Right Triangle:** I remember that in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side, opposite the right angle.\n- **Leg Lengths Given:** There's a clear distinction between the legs (75 and 100 units), which makes me think of the Pythagorean theorem.\n- **Pythagorean Theorem:** This theorem relates the lengths of the sides in a right triangle: \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\), where \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** This is the most straightforward approach I can think of. Plugging in the values for the legs should give me the hypotenuse.\n2. **Check for Special Triangles:** Since 75 and 100 don't seem to correspond to common Pythagorean triples, this might not apply here.\n3. **Visualizing the Triangle:** Drawing a sketch could help ensure I'm setting up the equation correctly, but for calculation, it's not strictly necessary.\n\n**Settling on an Approach:**\n- Given that the Pythagorean theorem is specifically designed for this type of problem, I think it's the best starting point. Let's try that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\n**Formula:**  \n\\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\]  \nWhere:\n- \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the lengths of the legs (75 and 100 units).\n- \\( c \\) is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Square the Legs:**\n   - \\( 75^2 = 5625 \\)\n   - \\( 100^2 = 10000 \\)\n\n2. **Add the Squares:**\n   \\[ 5625 + 10000 = 15625 \\]\n\n3. **Take the Square Root to Find \\( c \\):**\n   \\[ c = \\sqrt{15625} \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Squaring the legs seems straightforward. Adding them up gives a total of 15,625.\n- Now, taking the square root to find the hypotenuse. I\u2019ll need to check if this square root makes sense.\n\n**Checking the Calculation:**\n- Let me calculate \\( \\sqrt{15625} \\). \n- \\( 125 \\times 125 = 15625 \\), so \\( \\sqrt{15625} = 125 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, 125? That seems way smaller than either of the legs. Let me think\u2026 does this make sense?\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- The hypotenuse should be longer than both legs since it's the side opposite the right angle. Hmm, 125 being less than both 75 and 100 doesn't align with the properties of a right triangle.\n\n**Mistake Realization:**\n- Oh! I see the issue. The calculation is correct, but the interpretation here is off. The sides I squared and added are correct, but the square root giving me 125 seems inconsistent because it should be larger than 100.\n\n**Deep Reflection:**\n- **Possible Misinterpretation:** Maybe I misread the problem initially?\n- **Alternative Thought:** Could it be that I squared and added correctly but misapplied the square root?\n\n**Ah-Ha Moment:**\n- Wait a minute, let me re-evaluate. Perhaps I should double-check the square root calculation or see if there was an error in raising to the power.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Re-evaluating the Square Root Calculation**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Instead of relying on mental math, let's do the square root step more carefully.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Original Sum:**\n   \\[ 75^2 + 100^2 = 15625 \\]\n   \n2. **Square Root:**\n   \\[ c = \\sqrt{15625} = 125 \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The math checks out, but the length of the hypotenuse being 125 units is unexpectedly short compared to the legs.\n\n**Possible Issues:**\n- **Misunderstanding:** Perhaps the problem is asking for something different, but that seems unlikely since it's a standard right triangle question.\n- **Calculation Check:** Let's verify if \\( 75^2 + 100^2 = 15625 \\) holds true, which it does.\n- **Sample Solution Placehoder Issue:** Could it be that the sample solution provided is incorrect or misapplied here?\n\n**Checking with Another Strategy:**\n- **Alternative Approach:** Maybe try visualizing or looking for a pattern, but given the straightforward nature of the Pythagorean theorem, it's likely unnecessary.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Re-confirming that \\( c = \\sqrt{15625} = 125 \\) fits the Pythagorean theorem equation:\n  \\[ 75^2 + 100^2 = 15625 = 125^2 \\]\n- The equation balances, meaning the calculation is mathematically correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Although the hypotenuse being 125 units seems counterintuitive, mathematically, it satisfies the Pythagorean theorem. Perhaps the triangle described isn't a typical one, or there's an aspect of the problem that's unusual.\n\n**Insight:**\n- **Real-World Application:** In real-world scenarios, such a triangle might not be practical, but mathematically, it's valid.\n- **Sample Solution Placeholder Understanding:** It suggests that perhaps there's an assumption or additional context missing in the problem statement.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying with an Example or Additional Insight**\n\n**Approach:**\n- It might help to verify this with a known Pythagorean triple or apply another method to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n- **Check for Pythagorean Triple:** See if (75, 100, 125) aligns with a known triple.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- A Pythagorean triple satisfies \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\).\n- For \\( a = 75 \\), \\( b = 100 \\), and \\( c = 125 \\):\n  \\[ 75^2 + 100^2 = 15625 = 125^2 \\]\n- This confirms that (75, 100, 125) is indeed a Pythagorean triple.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This validation reinforces that the hypotenuse length of 125 units is correct.\n- It also suggests that the triangle adheres to the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Despite initial doubts, the Pythagorean theorem applied correctly leads to a hypotenuse of 125 units.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Brainstorming and Exploring:** Initially, I considered multiple strategies, settling on the Pythagorean theorem, which made the most sense.\n- **Checking Work:** Throughout, I checked calculations and reflected on whether the hypotenuse length was reasonable.\n- **Adjusting Approach:** When the hypotenuse length seemed small, I re-evaluated the square root calculation and verified the Pythagorean triple.\n- **Ensuring Correctness:** Multiple checks confirmed that the hypotenuse length is indeed 125 units.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe measure of the hypotenuse is **125 units**.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Consistency with Pythagorean Theorem:** The calculations consistently align with the theorem, confirming the correctness of the hypotenuse length.\n- **Sample Solution Placeholder Insight:** This process highlights the importance of verifying each step to ensure accuracy, especially when results seem counterintuitive.\n\nBy thinking through each step, exploring different strategies, and continuously checking and reflecting on the work, I've arrived confidently at the hypotenuse's length.",
