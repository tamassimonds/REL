    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies and thinking through each step, checking if my approach is correct along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the question, I see two circles overlapping in a coordinate plane:\n\n1. **Circle 1:** Centered at \\((2, -1)\\) with a radius of \\(4\\).\n2. **Circle 2:** Centered at \\((2, 5)\\) with a radius of \\(\\sqrt{10}\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Identical x-coordinates:** Both circles have their centers at \\(x = 2\\). This makes me think that the circles are vertically aligned. Maybe they intersect at points with the same \\(x\\)-coordinate but different \\(y\\)-coordinates.\n  \n- **Different radii:** The radii are different, which suggests that one circle is larger than the other. This might affect the intersection points.\n\n- **Finding \\((AB)^2\\):** I need to find the square of the distance between the intersection points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Squaring the distance might simplify calculations, especially if I can avoid dealing with square roots.\n\n**Strategies I\u2019m Considering:**\n\n1. **System of Equations:** Set up the equations for both circles and solve them simultaneously to find the intersection points.\n  \n2. **Geometric Insight:** Use the fact that the circles are vertically aligned to simplify the problem, perhaps by analyzing the distance between their centers.\n\n3. **Distance Formula Approach:** Calculate the distance between the centers and see how it relates to the radii to determine the type of intersection.\n\n**Brainstorming:** I think starting with the **System of Equations** makes sense because it\u2019s a direct method to find the intersection points. But I\u2019ll keep the other strategies in mind in case this approach gets too messy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Circle Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the intersection points, I need the equations of both circles. The general equation for a circle is:\n\n\\[\n(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Circle 1:** Center \\((2, -1)\\), Radius \\(4\\)\n  \n  \\[\n  (x - 2)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 16\n  \\]\n  \n- **Circle 2:** Center \\((2, 5)\\), Radius \\(\\sqrt{10}\\)\n  \n  \\[\n  (x - 2)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 10\n  \\]\n\n**Check:** This seems correct because I've simply written out the standard form of the circle equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find the coordinates of points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Since both equations have \\((x - 2)^2\\) on the left side, I can set the right sides equal to each other.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSet the two equations equal:\n\n\\[\n(y + 1)^2 = (y - 5)^2\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n1. Expand both sides:\n   \n   \\[\n   (y + 1)^2 = y^2 + 2y + 1\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   (y - 5)^2 = y^2 - 10y + 25\n   \\]\n   \n2. Set them equal:\n   \n   \\[\n   y^2 + 2y + 1 = y^2 - 10y + 25\n   \\]\n   \n3. Subtract \\(y^2\\) from both sides:\n   \n   \\[\n   2y + 1 = -10y + 25\n   \\]\n   \n4. Add \\(10y\\) to both sides:\n   \n   \\[\n   12y + 1 = 25\n   \\]\n   \n5. Subtract \\(1\\) from both sides:\n   \n   \\[\n   12y = 24\n   \\]\n   \n6. Divide by \\(12\\):\n   \n   \\[\n   y = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Check:** Wait, that can't be right because both circles have different \\(y\\)-coordinates for their centers. If \\(y = 2\\), it implies that the intersection points are horizontally aligned, which seems odd given the vertical alignment of the circles. Let me reflect\u2014maybe I made a mistake in simplifying. But actually, this suggests that the intersection points are at \\(y = 2\\), which might be correct.\n\n**Reflection:** \n\nGiven that there's only one \\(y\\)-value, this implies that the intersection points lie on the line \\(y = 2\\). Since both circles have the same \\(x\\)-coordinate for their centers (\\(x = 2\\)), it makes sense that the intersection points are also at \\(x = 2\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the \\(x\\)-Coordinate**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince both circles intersect at \\(y = 2\\), I need to find the corresponding \\(x\\)-coordinates. Looking back at the circle equations, I notice that the term \\((x - 2)^2\\) cancels out when setting the \\(y\\)-values equal. This suggests that the intersection points have the same \\(x\\)-coordinate as the centers, which is \\(x = 2\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nNow, substitute \\(y = 2\\) back into either circle's equation to find the \\(x\\)-coordinate:\n\nFor **Circle 1**:\n\n\\[\n(2 - 2)^2 + (2 + 1)^2 = 16 \\implies 0 + 9 = 16 \\quad \\text{(False)}\n\\]\n\nFor **Circle 2**:\n\n\\[\n(2 - 2)^2 + (2 - 5)^2 = 10 \\implies 0 + 9 = 10 \\quad \\text{(False)}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Wait, both equations don't hold true when \\(y = 2\\). This doesn\u2019t seem correct. Let me think\u2014maybe I misinterpreted something.\n\n**Reflection:** \n\nThis indicates that the assumption of having \\(y = 2\\) might be incorrect. I need to reconsider my approach. Perhaps there\u2019s another way to find the intersection points.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Re-Evaluating the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe I need to use a different method to find the intersection points. The fact that both circles have their centers aligned vertically suggests that they might intersect at two points with the same \\(x\\)-coordinate. However, since my previous approach didn't yield valid points, I might be missing something.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\nInstead of assuming \\(y = 2\\), perhaps I should directly solve the system of equations without simplifying prematurely.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's return to the original equations:\n\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 16 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 10 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\n**Subtraction:**\n\nSubtract equation (2) from (1):\n\n\\[\n(y + 1)^2 - (y - 5)^2 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Expanding:**\n\n\\[\n(y^2 + 2y + 1) - (y^2 - 10y + 25) = 6\n\\]\n\\[\n2y + 1 + 10y - 25 = 6\n\\]\n\\[\n12y - 24 = 6\n\\]\n\\[\n12y = 30\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{30}{12} = \\frac{5}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** \n\nNow I have \\(y = \\frac{5}{2}\\), which is \\(2.5\\). This seems more reasonable. Let\u2019s proceed to find the corresponding \\(x\\)-coordinate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the \\(x\\)-Coordinate Again**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have \\(y = \\frac{5}{2}\\), I can substitute this back into either circle\u2019s equation to find \\(x\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s use Circle 1\u2019s equation:\n\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 + \\left(\\frac{5}{2} + 1\\right)^2 = 16\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 + \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 = 16\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 + \\frac{49}{4} = 16\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 = 16 - \\frac{49}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 = \\frac{64}{4} - \\frac{49}{4} = \\frac{15}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 2 = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{4}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 2 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Coordinates of Intersection Points:**\n\n\\[\nA\\left(2 + \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}\\right), \\quad B\\left(2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Check:** \n\nThis time, the \\(x\\)-coordinates are symmetric around \\(x = 2\\), which aligns with the fact that the circles are vertically aligned. The \\(y\\)-coordinate is consistent between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), which makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating \\((AB)^2\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the coordinates of points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), I can calculate the square of the distance between them, \\((AB)^2\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nUsing the distance formula:\n\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the coordinates:\n\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{\\left(2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} - \\left(2 + \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{5}{2} - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{\\left(2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} - 2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\right)^2 + 0}\n\\]\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\sqrt{15}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{15}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n(AB)^2 = 15\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, that seems way too large for \\((AB)^2\\). Given that the circles have relatively small radii, an \\((AB)^2\\) value of \\(15\\) feels off. Let me re-examine my calculations.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, perhaps there was an error in calculating the \\(x\\)-coordinates or the distance. Let me backtrack to see where I might have gone wrong.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Re-checking the \\(x\\)-Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe I made an arithmetic error when calculating the \\(x\\)-coordinates. Let\u2019s revisit Step 5.\n\n**Re-calculation:**\n\nWe had:\n\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 = \\frac{15}{4}\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n\\[\nx - 2 = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 2 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Coordinates of Intersection Points:**\n\n\\[\nA\\left(2 + \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}\\right), \\quad B\\left(2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe \\(x\\)-coordinates are indeed symmetric around \\(x = 2\\), and the \\(y\\)-coordinates are the same. This should be correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Calculating \\((AB)^2\\) Again**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s compute \\((AB)^2\\) step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nUsing the distance formula:\n\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{\\left(x_B - x_A\\right)^2 + \\left(y_B - y_A\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the coordinates:\n\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{\\left(2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} - \\left(2 + \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{5}{2} - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the expression inside the square root:\n\n\\[\nx_B - x_A = 2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} - 2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2} = -\\sqrt{15}\n\\]\n\\[\ny_B - y_A = \\frac{5}{2} - \\frac{5}{2} = 0\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{(-\\sqrt{15})^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{15}\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n(AB)^2 = 15\n\\]\n\n**Error Check:**\n\nWait, I'm arriving at the same value again. This still seems large. Given the circle with radius \\(4\\) and \\(\\sqrt{10}\\), the maximum distance between intersection points should be less than \\(8\\) (the diameter of Circle 1) and more than \\(2\\) (since Circle 2 has a radius of \\(\\sqrt{10}\\)). An \\((AB)^2\\) of \\(15\\) corresponds to a distance of \\(\\sqrt{15} \\approx 3.87\\), which is reasonable given the radii.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nAfter re-evaluating, I realize that an \\((AB)^2\\) of \\(15\\) is indeed plausible. The key was ensuring that the calculations for the \\(x\\)-coordinates and the distance formula were correct. Throughout the steps, consistently checking and backtracking helped identify and correct any initial misinterpretations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n(AB)^2 = 15\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy carefully setting up the circle equations, solving them simultaneously, and methodically calculating the distance between the intersection points, I arrived at \\((AB)^2 = 15\\). Regularly checking each step ensured that the final result was accurate, even when initial doubts arose about the plausibility of the squared distance. This reflective approach is essential in solving geometric intersection problems to confirm the validity of the solution.",
