    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, mimicking the natural thought process a human might have. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect frequently, check my work, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at this problem, my initial reaction is that it involves tracking movements in different directions\u2014south, west, north, and east. This reminds me of coordinate geometry, maybe dealing with vectors or displacement.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure. It's been a while since I dealt with directional movements like this. Let me brainstorm a bit:\n\n- **Option 1:** Maybe I can visualize it using a grid or coordinate plane. Each direction corresponds to a movement along the x or y-axis.\n  \n- **Option 2:** Alternatively, perhaps I could draw it out step by step to see where each movement leads.\n\n- **Option 3:** Another thought is to use the Pythagorean theorem since we're looking for a straight-line distance between two points.\n\nHmm, Option 1 and Option 2 seem related\u2014using a grid and drawing it out could help solidify my understanding. Option 3 might come into play once I have the coordinates or final positions figured out.\n\n**Wait**, before deciding, let me reflect:\n\n- If I use a coordinate grid, I can assign numbers to directions, which might simplify tracking the movements.\n- Drawing it out could provide a visual representation, making it easier to see the overall path.\n\nBest to start with **Option 1**\u2014using a coordinate grid\u2014since it aligns with how directional movements typically translate to numerical coordinates.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up a Coordinate System**\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system to represent Leigh's movements.\n\n- **Origin (0, 0):** Let's assume Leigh starts at point A, which we'll denote as the origin for simplicity.\n\n- **Directions:**\n  - **South:** Movement along the negative y-axis.\n  - **West:** Movement along the negative x-axis.\n  - **North:** Movement along the positive y-axis.\n  - **East:** Movement along the positive x-axis.\n\nThis makes sense because each direction corresponds to a change in either the x or y coordinate.\n\n**Hmm**, is this correct? I think so because in a standard Cartesian plane, south and north relate to y-axis changes, while west and east relate to x-axis changes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Mapping Out Each Movement**\n\nNow, let's break down each step of Leigh's journey, updating the coordinates accordingly.\n\n1. **First Movement: 40 yards South**\n   - Starting at (0, 0)\n   - Moving 40 yards south \u2192 New coordinates: (0, -40)\n   \n   **Reflection:** That seems right. Moving south decreases the y-coordinate.\n\n2. **Second Movement: 60 yards West**\n   - From (0, -40), moving 60 yards west \u2192 New coordinates: (-60, -40)\n   \n   **Check:** This decreases the x-coordinate, which matches the west direction. Looks correct.\n\n3. **Third Movement: 10 yards North**\n   - From (-60, -40), moving 10 yards north \u2192 New coordinates: (-60, -30)\n   \n   **Wait**, I moved north, so the y-coordinate should increase by 10. This checks out.\n\n4. **Fourth Movement: 20 yards East**\n   - From (-60, -30), moving 20 yards east \u2192 New coordinates: (-40, -30)\n   \n   **Reflect:** Moving east increases the x-coordinate, which aligns with my expectations.\n\n**Quick Check:** After all these movements, Leigh ends up at (-40, -30). This seems reasonable based on the directional movements.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Length of \\( \\overline{AB} \\)**\n\nNow, to find the length of \\( \\overline{AB} \\), I need to determine the straight-line distance between points A (0, 0) and B (-40, -30).\n\n**Hmm**, this is a classic application of the Pythagorean theorem. Let's see if that's the right approach.\n\n- **Pythagorean Theorem:** In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\n- **Application Here:**\n  - The difference in x-coordinates: \\( \\Delta x = -40 - 0 = -40 \\)\n  - The difference in y-coordinates: \\( \\Delta y = -30 - 0 = -30 \\)\n  - So, the length \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is the hypotenuse:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\overline{AB} = \\sqrt{(\\Delta x)^2 + (\\Delta y)^2} = \\sqrt{(-40)^2 + (-30)^2} = \\sqrt{1600 + 900} = \\sqrt{2500} = 50\n  \\]\n\n**Wait a minute**, let me double-check this.\n\n- **Reflection:** Squaring -40 and -30 gives positive values (1600 and 900, respectively). Adding them up results in 2500, and the square root of 2500 is 50. This process seems correct.\n\n**Hmm**, I don't recall any mistakes here. This aligns with the Pythagorean theorem's application.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\nBefore finalizing, I want to ensure that my approach makes sense.\n\n**Check:** Does using a coordinate grid and applying the Pythagorean theorem appropriately account for all directional movements?\n\n**Reflection:** Yes, by mapping each movement to the coordinate plane and calculating the straight-line distance, I'm accurately capturing Leigh's journey from A to B.\n\n**Wait**, is there another method I could have used?\n\n- **Alternative Method:** Perhaps I could have drawn the path step by step and visually measured the diagonal distance. But that might be less precise than using mathematical calculations.\n\n**Conclusion:** The coordinate method with the Pythagorean theorem is the most accurate and straightforward approach for this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAfter brainstorming and exploring different strategies, I've determined that:\n\n- **Mapping the Movements:** Translating each directional movement into coordinate changes was effective.\n- **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:** Calculating the straight-line distance between the final coordinates provided the correct length of \\( \\overline{AB} \\).\n- **Reflection and Checks:** Continuously reflecting and verifying each step ensured the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Final Answer:** The length of \\( \\overline{AB} \\) is **50 yards**.\n\n---\n\nBy following this step-by-step approach, constantly checking and reflecting on each part of the process, and being open to adjusting strategies, I've arrived at the correct solution while mimicking a human's natural thought process.",

  "ground_truth": "Keep up with the north-south movement separately from the east-west movement.  Leigh goes 40 yards south and 10 yards north, so she ends up 30 yards south of her starting position.  She goes 60 yards west and 20 yards east for a net east-west displacement of 40 yards west.  Going 30 yards south and 40 yards west puts Leigh $\\sqrt{30^2+40^2}=\\boxed{50}$ yards away."
