    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll approach it by brainstorming different strategies, exploring each one, checking my work along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it on my own.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see that it's about finding the measure of angle \\( A \\) in a quadrilateral \\( ABCD \\) that is a parallelogram. I remember that in parallelograms, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. There's also a given angle of \\( 60^\\circ \\) at point \\( B \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n1. **Use Properties of Parallelograms:** Since \\( ABCD \\) is a parallelogram, I can leverage the properties of parallelograms related to angle measures.\n2. **Look at Given Angle:** The \\( 60^\\circ \\) angle at \\( B \\) might be helpful in finding other angles.\n3. **Consider Diagonals:** Diagonals in parallelograms bisect each other, but I don\u2019t see how that directly helps here.\n4. **Check for Similar Triangles:** Maybe there are similar triangles that could relate the angles, but I don't immediately see any.\n\nAt this point, **the most straightforward approach** seems to be using the properties of parallelograms regarding angle measures.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Properties of Parallelograms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. This is a fundamental property that I can rely on.\n\n**Let's list the properties:**\n- \\( \\angle A = \\angle C \\) (opposite angles are equal)\n- \\( \\angle B = \\angle D \\) (opposite angles are equal)\n- \\( \\angle A + \\angle B = 180^\\circ \\) (adjacent angles are supplementary)\n\n**Given:**\n- \\( \\angle B = 60^\\circ \\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Since \\( \\angle A + \\angle B = 180^\\circ \\):\n  \\[\n  \\angle A + 60^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\angle A = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 120^\\circ\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, let me double-check this. I used the property that adjacent angles are supplementary, and since \\( \\angle B = 60^\\circ \\), subtracting from \\( 180^\\circ \\) gives me \\( \\angle A = 120^\\circ \\). This seems correct because:\n\n- **Opposite Angles:** If \\( \\angle A = 120^\\circ \\), then \\( \\angle C = 120^\\circ \\).\n- **Angle at \\( B \\):** \\( \\angle B = 60^\\circ \\), so \\( \\angle D = 60^\\circ \\).\n- **Supplementary Check:** \\( \\angle A + \\angle B = 120^\\circ + 60^\\circ = 180^\\circ \\), which is correct.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:**\nThe measure of angle \\( A \\) is **\\( 120^\\circ \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Verifying with Diagonals**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Even though the diagonal properties don't directly help with angle measures, maybe visualizing or drawing the diagonals could confirm the correctness of the angle measures.\n\n**Action:**\n- Diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, but since we're not given information about the diagonals in this problem, I think it might overcomplicate things. Let's stick with the properties we've used.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Is this Necessary?** This approach might not be necessary since the properties of the parallelogram already gave us the answer directly.\n- **Check with Another Property:** Another property is that consecutive angles are supplementary, and I already used that.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSticking with the first approach is sufficient and aligns with the properties of parallelograms.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Check: Validating the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Does this make sense?** If \\( \\angle A = 120^\\circ \\) and \\( \\angle B = 60^\\circ \\), then:\n  - \\( \\angle C \\) should also be \\( 120^\\circ \\) (opposite \\( A \\)).\n  - \\( \\angle D \\) should be \\( 60^\\circ \\) (opposite \\( B \\)).\n  - All adjacent angles sum to \\( 180^\\circ \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- \\( \\angle A + \\angle B = 120^\\circ + 60^\\circ = 180^\\circ \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\( \\angle C \\) is expected to be \\( 120^\\circ \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\( \\angle D \\) is expected to be \\( 60^\\circ \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The properties are consistent, and the calculations align with the given information.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, applying the properties of parallelograms, and verifying the calculations, the measure of angle \\( A \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120^\\circ}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- **Initial Strategy Worked:** I initially thought using the properties of parallelograms would be the most straightforward, and it proved to be correct.\n- **Alternative Approach Not Necessary:** Considering diagonals didn't add value to solving this particular problem.\n- **Importance of Checking:** Regularly checking each step ensured the correctness of the solution.\n- **Reflection Throughout:** Reflecting on whether each approach made sense helped in validating the final answer.",
