I remember that quadratics can be expressed in various forms like standard, factored, or vertex form.\n- **Roots Provided:** \\( p(-7) = 0 \\) and \\( p(4) = 0 \\) indicate that \\( x = -7 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\) are roots of the polynomial. This is a crucial piece of information because it allows me to construct the polynomial using its roots.\n- **Additional Point Given:** \\( p(5) = -36 \\) provides a specific value of the polynomial at \\( x = 5 \\). This will help in determining the coefficients once I set up the polynomial.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure how to proceed immediately. Should I start by writing the polynomial in factored form using the roots, or maybe consider using a general quadratic equation and plug in the given points? Let's brainstorm a bit.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Factored Form Using Roots:**\n   - Since I have two roots, I can start by writing the polynomial as \\( p(x) = a(x + 7)(x - 4) \\), where \\( a \\) is a coefficient to be determined.\n   - This seems straightforward because it directly uses the given roots.\n\n2. **Standard Form Coefficients:**\n   - Alternatively, I could write the general quadratic \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\) and set up equations using all three given points to solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n3. **Vertex Form Consideration:**\n   - Maybe thinking about the vertex form \\( p(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k \\) might be useful, but I don't have information about the vertex directly. Since roots and a point are given, this might complicate things.\n\nFirst instinct tells me that starting with the **factored form** utilizing the roots would be the most direct approach. If it doesn't work out, I can always fall back to the standard form method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Starting with Factored Form**\n\nLet's go with the **factored form** approach:\n\n\\[ p(x) = a(x + 7)(x - 4) \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This incorporates the two known roots directly.\n- The coefficient \\( a \\) will scale the polynomial appropriately.\n- I only have one unknown \\( a \\), which should make it easier to solve once I use the third condition \\( p(5) = -36 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, before I proceed, I should maybe expand this to see what the polynomial looks like and ensure it's set up correctly. Let\u2019s expand it:\n\n\\[ p(x) = a[(x + 7)(x - 4)] \\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n(x + 7)(x - 4) = x^2 - 4x + 7x - 28 = x^2 + 3x - 28\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ p(x) = a(x^2 + 3x - 28) \\]\n\nAlright, this looks like a standard quadratic form scaled by \\( a \\). Now, let's move on to incorporate the third condition using \\( p(5) = -36 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Third Condition**\n\nWe have:\n\n\\[ p(5) = a(5^2 + 3(5) - 28) = -36 \\]\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\n\\[\np(5) = a(25 + 15 - 28) = a(12) = -36\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This gives me a straightforward equation to solve for \\( a \\).\n- It ensures that the polynomial satisfies the condition \\( p(5) = -36 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n12a = -36 \\implies a = \\frac{-36}{12} = -3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so \\( a = -3 \\). That means the polynomial is scaled negatively. Let\u2019s check if this makes sense. A negative \\( a \\) could imply that the parabola opens downwards, which might align with the condition \\( p(5) = -36 \\).\n\nBut before finalizing, let\u2019s quickly verify if this \\( a \\) works with all given conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying All Conditions**\n\nLet\u2019s substitute \\( a = -3 \\) back into the polynomial and check all conditions:\n\n#### **Original Polynomial:**\n\n\\[ p(x) = -3(x^2 + 3x - 28) \\]\n\\[ p(x) = -3x^2 - 9x + 84 \\]\n\n#### **Checking \\( p(-7) = 0 \\):**\n\n\\[\np(-7) = -3(-7)^2 - 9(-7) + 84 = -3(49) + 63 + 84 = -147 + 63 + 84 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:** \u2705\n\nCondition \\( p(-7) = 0 \\) is satisfied.\n\n#### **Checking \\( p(4) = 0 \\):**\n\n\\[\np(4) = -3(4)^2 - 9(4) + 84 = -3(16) - 36 + 84 = -48 - 36 + 84 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:** \u2705\n\nCondition \\( p(4) = 0 \\) is satisfied.\n\n#### **Checking \\( p(5) = -36 \\):**\n\n\\[\np(5) = -3(5)^2 - 9(5) + 84 = -3(25) - 45 + 84 = -75 - 45 + 84 = -36\n\\]\n\n**Check:** \u2705\n\nCondition \\( p(5) = -36 \\) is satisfied.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAll conditions are met with \\( a = -3 \\). This suggests that the factored form approach was correct from the beginning. It also reassures me that the polynomial is accurately determined.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Standard Form Verification**\n\nJust to ensure that our solution is robust, let\u2019s see if starting from the standard form would lead to the same polynomial.\n\n#### **Assuming:**\n\n\\[ p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\]\n\n#### **Setting Up Equations:**\n\n1. \\( p(-7) = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   a(-7)^2 + b(-7) + c = 0 \\implies 49a - 7b + c = 0 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n\n2. \\( p(4) = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   a(4)^2 + b(4) + c = 0 \\implies 16a + 4b + c = 0 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n3. \\( p(5) = -36 \\):\n   \\[\n   a(5)^2 + b(5) + c = -36 \\implies 25a + 5b + c = -36 \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}\n   \\]\n\n#### **Solving the System:**\n\nLet\u2019s solve these equations step by step.\n\n**Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:**\n\n\\[\n(16a + 4b + c) - (49a - 7b + c) = 0 - 0\n\\]\n\\[\n16a + 4b + c - 49a + 7b - c = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n-33a + 11b = 0 \\implies -3a + b = 0 \\implies b = 3a\n\\]\n\n**Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:**\n\n\\[\n(25a + 5b + c) - (16a + 4b + c) = -36 - 0\n\\]\n\\[\n25a + 5b + c - 16a - 4b - c = -36\n\\]\n\\[\n9a + b = -36\n\\]\n\n**Substitute \\( b = 3a \\) into \\( 9a + b = -36 \\):**\n\n\\[\n9a + 3a = -36\n\\]\n\\[\n12a = -36 \\implies a = -3\n\\]\n\\[\nb = 3(-3) = -9\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, from the standard form approach, we obtain:\n\n\\[\np(x) = -3x^2 - 9x + c\n\\]\n\nBut we still need to determine \\( c \\). However, since we were initially using the factored form and had already determined \\( a \\), this inconsistency suggests that the standard form might not be necessary here.\n\n**Final Step: Determining \\( c \\) Using Any Condition**\n\nLet's use one of the conditions to find \\( c \\). Using \\( p(5) = -36 \\):\n\n\\[\np(5) = -3(5)^2 - 9(5) + c = -36\n\\]\n\\[\n-75 - 45 + c = -36\n\\]\n\\[\n-120 + c = -36 \\implies c = -36 + 120 = 84\n\\]\n\nSo, the polynomial in standard form is:\n\n\\[\np(x) = -3x^2 - 9x + 84\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth approaches lead to the same polynomial:\n\n\\[\np(x) = -3x^2 - 9x + 84\n\\]\n\nThis consistency reassures me that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying through both factored and standard form approaches, the quadratic polynomial is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{p(x) = -3x^2 - 9x + 84}\n\\]",
