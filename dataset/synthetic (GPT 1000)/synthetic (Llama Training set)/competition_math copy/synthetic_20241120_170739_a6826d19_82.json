    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on whether they're working, and adjusting my approach as needed. I\u2019ll walk you through my thought process, complete with initial reflections, explorations, checks, and any \u201caha\u201d moments.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \\( x^4 - 34x^2 + 225 = 0 \\), I think:\n\n- **This looks familiar:** It reminds me of quadratic equations, especially because it's in terms of \\( x^2 \\) and \\( x^4 \\). \n- **Maybe a substitution could help:** Perhaps substituting \\( y = x^2 \\) might simplify it into a standard quadratic form.\n- **Wait:** I see that the equation involves \\( x^4 \\) and \\( x^2 \\), which often hints at factoring or using the quadratic formula after substitution.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if substitution is the only way. Maybe there's another method I'm overlooking, like factoring directly or using polynomial identities. \n\nLet\u2019s explore these ideas.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Substitution Method:**\n   - Let \\( y = x^2 \\), transforming the equation into a quadratic in terms of \\( y \\).\n   - Solve for \\( y \\) using the quadratic formula or factoring.\n  \n2. **Factoring Method:**\n   - Try to factor the original equation directly.\n   - Look for patterns, like perfect squares or other factorable forms.\n\n3. **Quadratic Formula:**\n   - If substitution leads to a quadratic in \\( y \\), apply the quadratic formula to find \\( y \\).\n  \n4. **Graphical Approach:**\n   - Although not strictly necessary, graphing the equation might provide visual insight into the roots.\n\nHmm, factoring directly seems challenging because the constant term is 225, and I don\u2019t immediately see obvious factors that would fit. Graphing could help, but for an exact solution, I'd prefer algebraic methods.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the **Substitution Method**, as it seems the most straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Substitution Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s replace \\( x^2 \\) with \\( y \\) to simplify the equation. This transformation should turn the quartic equation into a quadratic one, making it easier to solve.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 = y \\implies x^4 = (x^2)^2 = y^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into the original equation:\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 34y + 225 = 0\n\\]\n\nAlright, now we have a standard quadratic equation. Let\u2019s see if we can factor this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting to Factor the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI\u2019ll try to factor \\( y^2 - 34y + 225 = 0 \\). To factor a quadratic of the form \\( y^2 + by + c \\), I need two numbers that multiply to \\( c \\) (225) and add up to \\( b \\) (-34).\n\n**Reflection:**\nLet\u2019s look at the factors of 225: \\( 1 \\times 225, 3 \\times 75, 5 \\times 45, 9 \\times 25, 15 \\times 15 \\).\n\n- **Checking:** \n  - \\( 1 + 225 = 226 \\)\n  - \\( 3 + 75 = 78 \\)\n  - \\( 5 + 45 = 50 \\)\n  - **Wait!** \\( 15 + 15 = 30 \\), but I need -34, so maybe I need negative factors?\n\nLet me consider negative factors:\n\n- \\( -15 \\times -15 = 225 \\)\n- \\( -15 + -15 = -30 \\)\n\nHmm, this doesn't add up to -34. Maybe I need to include possible negative combinations differently.\n\n**Realization:**\nWait, factoring might not be working here because it's tricky to find integers that satisfy both conditions. Perhaps the equation doesn't factor nicely with integers.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\nIf factoring doesn\u2019t seem straightforward, maybe I should use the **Quadratic Formula** instead.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince factoring didn't work easily, let's apply the quadratic formula to find the roots of \\( y^2 - 34y + 225 = 0 \\).\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -34 \\), and \\( c = 225 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{34 \\pm \\sqrt{(-34)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 225}}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{34 \\pm \\sqrt{1156 - 900}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{34 \\pm \\sqrt{256}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{34 \\pm 16}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y = \\frac{18}{2} = 9\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, we have two possible values for \\( y \\): 25 and 9.\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this make sense? The quadratic formula should give us the correct roots if applied correctly. Let\u2019s see if these \\( y \\) values can correspond to real \\( x \\) values.\n\n- **If \\( y = 25 \\):**\n  \\[\n  x^2 = 25 \\implies x = \\pm 5\n  \\]\n  \n- **If \\( y = 9 \\):**\n  \\[\n  x^2 = 9 \\implies x = \\pm 3\n  \\]\n  \n**Key Insight:**\nSo, the possible \\( x \\) values are \\( 5, -5, 3, -3 \\). The smallest solution among these is **-5**.\n\nBut let me double-check to ensure I haven\u2019t missed anything.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore concluding, it's essential to verify that these \\( x \\) values satisfy the original equation. This step ensures there were no mistakes along the way.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s substitute \\( x = 5, -5, 3, \\) and \\( -3 \\) back into the original equation \\( x^4 - 34x^2 + 225 = 0 \\).\n\n- **For \\( x = 5 \\):**\n  \\[\n  5^4 - 34(5^2) + 225 = 625 - 850 + 225 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  \u2714\ufe0f Valid solution.\n\n- **For \\( x = -5 \\):**\n  \\[\n  (-5)^4 - 34(-5)^2 + 225 = 625 - 850 + 225 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  \u2714\ufe0f Valid solution.\n\n- **For \\( x = 3 \\):**\n  \\[\n  3^4 - 34(3^2) + 225 = 81 - 306 + 225 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  \u2714\ufe0f Valid solution.\n\n- **For \\( x = -3 \\):**\n  \\[\n  (-3)^4 - 34(-3)^2 + 225 = 81 - 306 + 225 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  \u2714\ufe0f Valid solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\nAll four solutions satisfy the original equation. Therefore, my approach seems correct, and no steps were skipped.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe smallest solution of the equation \\( x^4 - 34x^2 + 225 = 0 \\) is **-5**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThis problem initially led me to consider substitution to simplify the quartic equation into a quadratic, which made the problem much more manageable. \n\n- **Facoring Attempt:** Trying to factor the quadratic directly revealed that finding integer factors was not straightforward.\n- **Quadratic Formula:** Applying the quadratic formula provided the exact roots needed to find the \\( x \\) solutions.\n- **Verification:** Substituting back into the original equation confirmed the correctness of the solutions.\n\nOverall, taking a moment to brainstorm different strategies and being open to switching methods when one doesn't seem to work led to a clear and accurate solution. Reflecting and checking along the way ensured that each step was valid, ultimately guiding me to the correct answer.\n\n**Smallest Solution:** \\(\\boxed{-5}\\)",

We write $225=3\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot5$ and try a few different pairs until we find that 9 and 25 satisfy the requirements.
