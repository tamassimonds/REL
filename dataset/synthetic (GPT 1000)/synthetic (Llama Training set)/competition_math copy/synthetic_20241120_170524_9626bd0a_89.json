    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through it just like I would if I were working on it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're correct, check my work often, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's dive in.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n\nWhen I read the problem, it mentions a pattern of marbles: gray, white, and black, repeating in specific blocks. The total is 180 marbles, and I need to find out the color of the 158th marble.\n\nInitial Brainstorming:\n\n- **Pattern Recognition:** This seems similar to problems involving repeating sequences. I remember dealing with patterns like this before.\n- **Total Length:** With 180 marbles, I'm dealing with a fixed-length sequence.\n- **Positioning:** I need to determine the position within the repeating unit.\n\nAt this point, it feels like I need to identify the repeating pattern and see how the 158th marble fits into it.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Pattern**\n\nThoughts:\n\nTo determine the color of the 158th marble, I first need to figure out the length of the repeating pattern.\n\nGiven:\n\n- 5 gray marbles\n- 4 white marbles\n- 3 black marbles\n\nReflecting on the Sequence:\n\nWait, let me double-check the order:\n\n- **Gray:** 5\n- **White:** 4\n- **Black:** 3\n\nDoes that add up? Let's see:  \n5 + 4 + 3 = 12\n\nHmm, so the complete repeating unit is 12 marbles long.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nOh! By breaking it down into a smaller repeating unit, it's easier to find the color of any specific marble. This reminds me of modular arithmetic, where we deal with remainders.\n\n### **Step 3: Applying Modular Arithmetic**\n\nThoughts:\n\nNow that I know the pattern is 12 marbles long, I can use modular arithmetic to find where the 158th marble falls within this pattern.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet me calculate the position within the repeating unit:\n\n\\[  \n158 \\mod 12  \n\\]\n\nWait, let me do the division:\n\n\\[  \n158 \u00f7 12 = 13 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\, 2  \n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[  \n158 \\mod 12 = 2  \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nHmm, this means the 158th marble is in the same position as the 2nd marble in the repeating pattern. Let me double-check if this makes sense.\n\n### **Step 4: Mapping the Position to the Color**\n\nThoughts:\n\nNow I need to see where the 2nd marble falls within the 12-marble repeating unit.\n\n**Repeating Unit Breakdown:**\n\nLet's list out the positions within one complete cycle (12 marbles):\n\n1. Gray\n2. Gray\n3. Gray\n4. Gray\n5. Gray\n6. White\n7. White\n8. White\n9. White\n10. Black\n11. Black\n12. Black\n\nReflecting on the List:\n\nWait, let me double-check to ensure I've correctly assigned the colors to their positions. Does it follow the given pattern?\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nYeah, it follows:  \n5 grays, then 4 whites, then 3 blacks. The sequence adds up to 12.\n\n**Identifying the 2nd Marble:**\n\nLooking at the list, the 2nd marble is gray.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nThoughts:\n\nSo, according to the pattern and the calculations:\n\n- **Position 158 corresponds to Position 2 within the repeating unit.**\n- **Position 2 in the repeating unit is gray.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe color of the 158th marble is gray.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nDid this process make sense?\n\n- **Starting Point:** Identifying the repeating pattern was crucial.\n- **Modular Arithmetic Use:** Correctly applying it helped pinpoint the exact position.\n- **Mapping to Colors:** Ensured accuracy in determining the marble's color.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nLet me quickly verify if this method is reliable. By consistently applying modular arithmetic to find positions within a repeating pattern, this approach should work for any position requested.\n\nEverything seems to align correctly, so I'm confident that the color of the 158th marble is indeed gray.\n\n---\n\nBy thinking through each step, checking my work, and being open to adjusting my approach, I've arrived at the correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "We notice that the marbles appear in strings of 5 gray, 4 white, 3 black.  These strings have 12 marbles each.  Since  \\[158=13\\cdot12+2,\\]there are 13 full strings of marbles and 2 extras.  Since the first 5 marbles in any group are gray, the two extra marbles must be $\\boxed{\\text{gray}}$."
