    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were working through it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and adjust my approach as needed. Here we go.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, the problem is asking for the values of \\( z \\) that satisfy the inequality:\n\n\\[ z^2 - 40z + 340 \\le 4 \\]\n\nAnd then, we need to express the answer in interval notation.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Quadratic Equation:** This looks like a quadratic equation because of the \\( z^2 \\) term. I'm reminded that inequalities involving quadratics can often be solved by finding the roots and determining where the quadratic is above or below a certain value.\n  \n- **Standard Approach:** Typically, I would set up the equation by moving all terms to one side to find the roots, then use those roots to analyze the intervals.\n\n- **Alternative Methods:** Maybe I could complete the square to make it easier to see the vertex of the parabola, or I could use the quadratic formula directly. Another idea is to graph the quadratic to visually inspect the solution regions.\n\n- **Checking Strategy:** Wait, if I move all terms to one side, am I sure that will help? Perhaps starting with completing the square might offer more insight into the parabola's behavior.\n\n**Reflection:**\nI'm leaning towards completing the square first because it might simplify the inequality and make it easier to identify the solution set. Let me try that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Completing the Square**\n\n**Approach:**\nI\u2019ll try to complete the square for the expression \\( z^2 - 40z + 340 \\) to rewrite it in a more manageable form.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Standard Form:** Recall that completing the square involves transforming \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) into \\( a(x - p)^2 + q \\).\n  \n- **Finding \\( p \\):** For \\( z^2 - 40z \\), I need to find a value that makes it a perfect square trinomial.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Half of } b = \\frac{-40}{2} = -20\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Square of half } b = (-20)^2 = 400\n  \\]\n  \n- **Adding and Subtracting 400:**\n  \\[\n  z^2 - 40z + 400 - 400 + 340 \\le 4\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (z - 20)^2 - 60 \\le 4\n  \\]\n\n**Checking Work:**\nDoes \\( (z - 20)^2 - 60 \\) look correct? \nI added 400 to complete the square and subtracted it back, so that should be right.\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, I\u2019ve subtracted 400 but only needed to add 60 to both sides to keep the inequality balanced. Let me correct this.\n\n**Correction:**\n\\[\n(z - 20)^2 - 60 \\le 4\n\\]\n\\[\n(z - 20)^2 \\le 64\n\\]\n\n**Repaired Calculation:**\n\\[\n(z - 20)^2 \\le 64\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Inequality**\n\n**Approach:**\nNow, I need to solve \\( (z - 20)^2 \\le 64 \\). This inequality tells us that the square of \\( z - 20 \\) is at most 64.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Taking Square Roots:** I know that if \\( (z - 20)^2 \\le 64 \\), then \\( z - 20 \\) must be between -8 and 8 because the square root of 64 is 8.\n\n- **Setting Up the Inequality:**\n  \\[\n  -8 \\le z - 20 \\le 8\n  \\]\n\n- **Solving for \\( z \\):**\n  \\[\n  -8 + 20 \\le z \\le 8 + 20\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  12 \\le z \\le 28\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, so \\( z \\) must be between 12 and 28 inclusive. That makes sense because the original inequality was about the quadratic being less than or equal to 4, and completing the square helped isolate the variable.\n\n**Checking Work:**\nDoes this interval cover all possible values of \\( z \\) that satisfy the original inequality? Yes, because \\( (z - 20)^2 \\) is always non-negative, and the solution set captures all \\( z \\) where this square is less than or equal to 64.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Expressing the Solution in Interval Notation**\n\n**Approach:**\nFinally, I need to write the solution in interval notation, which shows all possible values of \\( z \\) that satisfy the inequality.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Inclusive Endpoints:** Since the inequality is \\( \\le \\), both endpoints 12 and 28 are included in the solution set.\n\n- **Interval Notation:**\n  \\[\n  [12, 28]\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis interval notation correctly represents all \\( z \\) values from 12 to 28, inclusive. It aligns with the solution we derived from completing the square.\n\n**Checking Work:**\nIs there any possibility I missed? No, completing the square directly led me to the correct range for \\( z \\), and there's no ambiguity in the interval notation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Brainstorming Payoff:** Starting with completing the square was beneficial because it simplified the inequality and made the solution straightforward.\n  \n- **Strategy Check:** Initially, I considered using the quadratic formula or graphing, but completing the square proved more efficient.\n\n- **Mistakes and Corrections:** I briefly made an error in subtracting 400 instead of adding the correct constant, but catching that early prevented further issues.\n\n- **Aha Moments:** Realizing that completing the square directly related the quadratic to a perfect square inequality clarified the bounds for \\( z \\).\n\n- **Confidence in Answer:** The step-by-step approach, along with checking at each stage, ensures that the final answer is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe values of \\( z \\) that satisfy the inequality \\( z^2 - 40z + 340 \\le 4 \\) are:\n\n\\[ [12, 28] \\]\n\n---\n\nThat's how I would naturally think through and solve this problem, reflecting and adjusting my approach as needed to ensure accuracy.",

  "ground_truth": "We can simplify the inequality to $z^2-40z+336\\le 0$. We could solve for the roots using the quadratic formula, but there is an easier solution by factoring: $z^2-40z+336=(z-12)(z-28)$. Thus the parabola $z^2-40z+336$ changes sign at $z=12$ and $z=28$. The solution is either the interval $(-\\infty,12]\\cup[28,\\infty)$ or $[12,28]$. We test values to find that the quadratic is non-positive over the interval $\\boxed{[12,28]}$."
