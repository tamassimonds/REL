    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem just like we would if we were working through it ourselves. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and make sure to check my work frequently to ensure everything makes sense. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we have a triangle with side lengths of \\(7\\), \\(10\\), and \\(x^2\\), where \\(x\\) is a positive integer. The question asks for all positive integer values of \\(x\\) that make the triangle exist. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Triangle Inequality Theorem:** I remember from geometry that triangles must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. This means the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\n- **Possible Values for \\(x\\):** Since \\(x\\) is a positive integer, \\(x^2\\) will be a perfect square. I need to find which perfect squares satisfy the triangle inequalities with \\(7\\) and \\(10\\).\n\n**Confusion/Reflection:**\n- **What If \\(x\\) Is Small or Large?** I'm thinking that if \\(x\\) is too small, \\(x^2\\) might not satisfy the inequalities. If \\(x\\) is too large, \\(x^2\\) could overpower the other sides, making it impossible to form a triangle.\n- **Need to Verify Approach:** Before proceeding, let me confirm that the triangle inequality is indeed the right approach. I believe it is, but it's worth double-checking.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Apply the Triangle Inequality Directly:**\n   - Use all three inequalities involving \\(7\\), \\(10\\), and \\(x^2\\).\n   \n2. **List Possible Values of \\(x\\) and Check:**\n   - Since \\(x\\) is a positive integer, maybe list \\(x = 1, 2, 3, ...\\) and calculate \\(x^2\\) to see which satisfy the inequalities.\n   \n3. **Graphical Approach:**\n   - Plot the inequalities to see the feasible range for \\(x^2\\). This seems more advanced but could visually help.\n\n4. **Simplify Inequalities Algebraically:**\n   - Simplify the inequalities to find ranges for \\(x\\) without listing all possibilities.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Listing \\(x\\) Values:** This is straightforward but might be time-consuming if \\(x\\) can be large.\n- **Algebraic Simplification:** Seems like a cleaner approach. I think I'll start with this to narrow down the possible \\(x\\) values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Triangle Inequality**\n\nLet's apply the triangle inequality theorem:\n\n1. **Sum of Any Two Sides Greater Than the Third:**\n   - \\(7 + 10 > x^2\\)\n   - \\(7 + x^2 > 10\\)\n   - \\(10 + x^2 > 7\\)\n\n**Inequalities:**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1. & \\quad 7 + 10 > x^2 & \\Rightarrow & \\quad 17 > x^2 \\\\\n2. & \\quad 7 + x^2 > 10 & \\Rightarrow & \\quad x^2 > 3 \\\\\n3. & \\quad 10 + x^2 > 7 & \\Rightarrow & \\quad x^2 > -3 \\quad (\\text{always true since } x^2 \\geq 0)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Third Inequality:** \\(x^2 > -3\\) is always true because squares are non-negative. So, it doesn't impose any additional constraints.\n- **First Two Inequalities:** These are the main ones to consider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Inequalities**\n\nNow, let's solve the first two inequalities:\n\n1. **From \\(17 > x^2\\):**\n   \\[\n   x^2 < 17\n   \\]\n   Taking square roots:\n   \\[\n   -\\sqrt{17} < x < \\sqrt{17}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(x\\) is a positive integer:\n   \\[\n   0 < x < \\sqrt{17} \\approx 4.12\n   \\]\n   So, \\(x\\) can be \\(1, 2, 3, 4\\).\n\n2. **From \\(x^2 > 3\\):**\n   \\[\n   x > \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732\n   \\]\n   Since \\(x\\) is a positive integer, the smallest possible \\(x\\) is \\(2\\).\n\n**Combined Range:**\n\\[\n2 \\leq x \\leq 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Possible \\(x\\) Values:** \\(x = 2\\), \\(x = 3\\), \\(x = 4\\).\n- **Check:** This range makes sense because it excludes \\(x = 1\\) (since \\(1^2 = 1 < 3\\)) and includes up to \\(x = 4\\) (since \\(4^2 = 16 < 17\\)).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Range with Sample Values**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's verify by plugging in the values:\n\n1. **For \\(x = 2\\):**\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 4 \\\\\n   7 + 10 = 17 > 4 \\\\\n   7 + 4 = 11 > 10 \\\\\n   10 + 4 = 14 > 7 \\\\\n   \\text{All inequalities are satisfied.}\n   \\]\n\n2. **For \\(x = 3\\):**\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 9 \\\\\n   7 + 10 = 17 > 9 \\\\\n   7 + 9 = 16 > 10 \\\\\n   10 + 9 = 19 > 7 \\\\\n   \\text{All inequalities are satisfied.}\n   \\]\n\n3. **For \\(x = 4\\):**\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 16 \\\\\n   7 + 10 = 17 > 16 \\\\\n   7 + 16 = 23 > 10 \\\\\n   10 + 16 = 26 > 7 \\\\\n   \\text{All inequalities are satisfied.}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **All Checks Passed:** Each value of \\(x\\) within the range satisfies all triangle inequalities. This confirms that our range is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finalizing the Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis, the positive integer values of \\(x\\) that make the triangle exist are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2, 3, 4}\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- **Approach Validity:** Applying the triangle inequality was the right strategy.\n- **Range Accuracy:** The range \\(2 \\leq x \\leq 4\\) correctly captures all possible integer values of \\(x\\) that satisfy the conditions.\n- **Sample Verification:** Checking individual \\(x\\) values ensured that our inequalities hold true.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does the Answer Make Sense?** Yes, all selected \\(x\\) values lead to valid triangles.\n- **Is Anything Missing?** No, the approach covered all necessary inequalities and verified with sample checks.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy methodically applying the triangle inequality theorem and verifying each potential \\(x\\) value, we've determined that the positive integer values of \\(x\\) that allow the triangle to exist are \\(2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(4\\). Throughout the process, checking and reflecting at each step ensured the accuracy and correctness of the approach and final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "For a triangle to exist, the sum of two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third. Therefore, we have three formulas: $x^2+7>10 \\to x^2>3$, $x^2+10>7 \\to x^2>-3$, and $7+10>x^2 \\to x^2<17$. Thus, we have two quadratics, $x^2>3$ and $x^2<17$.
