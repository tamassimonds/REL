    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking if each makes sense, and adjusting as needed \u2013 just like I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst off, let's re-read the problem to ensure I grasp what's being asked:\n\n*Suppose that \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{2x + b} \\). For what value of \\( b \\) does \\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \\)?*\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- We're dealing with a function \\( f(x) \\) and its inverse \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n- The goal is to find the value of \\( b \\) that makes the given expression equal to the inverse function.\n- Inverses typically involve swapping \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in an equation, so I might need to think along those lines.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Find the Inverse Function Directly:**\n   - Attempt to find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) by algebraically manipulating \\( f(x) \\).\n   \n2. **Set Up an Equation:**\n   - Since we know \\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \\), I could set up an equation involving \\( f(x) \\) and its inverse.\n   \n3. **Check for Consistency:**\n   - Ensure that the given inverse expression is indeed valid for the function defined.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **First Idea:** Finding the inverse directly seems straightforward. If I can derive \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), I can compare it to the given expression to find \\( b \\).\n- **But Wait:** I should verify that the inverse function calculation is correct. If not, perhaps there's another method that naturally aligns with the given inverse.\n\n### **Step 1: Find the Inverse Function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find the inverse, I'll set \\( f(x) = y \\) and solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\).\n- Once I have \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\), I'll swap \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to get \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n\n**Starting with the Function:**\n\n\\[ \ny = \\frac{1}{2x + b} \n\\]\n\n**Solve for \\( x \\):**\n\n1. **Multiply both sides by \\( 2x + b \\):**\n\n   \\[ \n   y(2x + b) = 1 \n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand the equation:**\n\n   \\[ \n   2xy + by = 1 \n   \\]\n\n3. **Rearrange to isolate \\( x \\):**\n\n   \\[ \n   2xy = 1 - by \n   \\]\n   \n   \\[ \n   x = \\frac{1 - by}{2y} \n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Swapping \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) should give the inverse. So, \\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{1 - bx}{2x} \\).\n- **Check:** Wait, the given \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) is \\( \\frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \\). This suggests something needs to be adjusted.\n\n**Mistake Identified:**\n- **Realization:** It looks like I missed aligning the terms correctly. Let me revisit the steps.\n\n### **Revisiting Step 1: Correcting the Inverse Function Calculation**\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\n1. **Starting with:** \n\n   \\[ \n   y(2x + b) = 1 \n   \\]\n\n2. **Rearranging correctly:**\n\n   \\[ \n   2xy + by = 1 \n   \\]\n   \n   \\[ \n   2xy = 1 - by \n   \\]\n   \n   \\[ \n   x = \\frac{1 - by}{2y} \n   \\]\n\n3. **Swapping \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):**\n\n   \\[ \n   f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{1 - bx}{2x} \n   \\]\n\n**Comparison with Given Inverse:**\n- The given inverse is \\( \\frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \\), not \\( \\frac{1 - bx}{2x} \\).\n- **Wait a Minute:** This discrepancy suggests that the value of \\( b \\) must be such that \\( bx = 2x \\) for the inverses to match.\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation to Solve for \\( b \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To make \\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \\), the two expressions must be equal.\n- Therefore, set \\( \\frac{1 - bx}{2x} = \\frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \\).\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{1 - bx}{2x} = \\frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( b \\):**\n\n1. **Multiply both sides by \\( 2x \\) to eliminate the denominator:**\n\n   \\[ \n   1 - bx = 1 - 2x \n   \\]\n\n2. **Rearrange to isolate terms involving \\( b \\):**\n\n   \\[ \n   -bx = -2x \n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide both sides by \\( -x \\) (assuming \\( x \\neq 0 \\)):**\n\n   \\[ \n   b = 2 \n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Does \\( b = 2 \\) make the original inverse condition true?\n- **Quick Check:** Substituting \\( b = 2 \\) into \\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{1 - bx}{2x} \\) gives \\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{1 - 2x}{2x} \\), which matches the given inverse.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and correcting the approach, the value of \\( b \\) that satisfies the condition is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Misstep:** Trying to find the inverse and directly comparing led to a brief confusion. It highlighted the importance of ensuring each step aligns with the problem's requirements.\n- **Strategy Adjustment:** Realizing that setting the two inverse expressions equal was the key insight that streamlined the solution.\n- **Verification:** Always checking if the calculated \\( b \\) makes the given inverse true reassures the correctness of the solution.\n\nBy reflecting often, checking for consistency, and being open to adjusting strategies, the problem was approached methodically, leading to the correct answer.",
