    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it just like I would while solving it in real life, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking if I'm on the right track, and adjusting my methods as needed. \n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first read the question, it asks how many miles a car can travel in 20 minutes if it's moving at \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) the speed of a train traveling at 80 miles per hour. \n\n- **Immediate Reactions:**\n  - This seems to be a speed, time, and distance problem, which reminds me of the basic formula \\( \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\).\n  - I recall that speed is often expressed in miles per hour (mph), and time here is in minutes, so I'll probably need to convert units.\n  - The \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) factor is interesting; it suggests that the car is traveling at three-quarters the speed of the train, so I\u2019ll need to calculate that first.\n\n- **Uncertainty:**\n  - I'm a bit unsure about whether I should convert the train's speed to miles per minute or convert the time from minutes to hours. Both seem valid.\n  - I want to make sure my unit conversions are correct to avoid mistakes later on.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Convert Train's Speed to Miles per Minute:**\n   - This seems straightforward since the car's speed is a fraction of the train's speed.\n   \n2. **Convert Time to Hours and Keep Train's Speed in MPH:**\n   - This is another option, but it might complicate things since the car's speed isn't in hours.\n\n3. **Use Ratios to Simplify:**\n   - Perhaps using ratios to compare the car's and train's speeds and distances might work.\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - **Which approach seems more direct?** Converting the train's speed to miles per minute (Strategy 1) feels more straightforward because it aligns the units with the time given.\n\n- **Decision:**\n  - I'll start by converting the train's speed to miles per minute and then calculate the car's speed.\n\n### **Step 1: Convert Train's Speed to Miles per Minute**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - The train travels 80 miles in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, I can find the speed in miles per minute by dividing 80 by 60.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Train's Speed} = \\frac{80 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ miles per minute}\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - Does \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) miles per minute make sense? \n  - Yes, because 80 miles in 60 minutes simplifies to \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) miles per minute, which is consistent.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Car's Speed**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - The car travels at \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) the speed of the train. So, I need to multiply the train's speed by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Car's Speed} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ miles per minute} = 1 \\text{ mile per minute}\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - Wait, multiplying \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) by \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) equals 1. \n  - That means the car travels 1 mile per minute, which seems reasonable since \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) is 1.\n\n- **Check:**\n  - Does this align with the problem's conditions? \n  - Yes, the car is traveling at 1 mile per minute, which is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the train's speed.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Distance Travelled by the Car in 20 Minutes**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - Now that I know the car's speed is 1 mile per minute, I can use the distance formula \\( \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\) to find out how far it travels in 20 minutes.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = 1 \\text{ mile per minute} \\times 20 \\text{ minutes} = 20 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n  - Does it make sense for the car to travel 20 miles in 20 minutes at 1 mile per minute? \n  - Yes, because at 1 mile per minute, in 20 minutes, the car would cover 20 miles.\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Entire Approach**\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - Looking back, converting the train's speed to miles per minute was a good start. \n  - Multiplying by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) to find the car's speed made sense, and using the distance formula with the car's speed and time yielded a logical result.\n\n- **Check:**\n  - Does the car's speed being 1 mile per minute and covering 20 miles in 20 minutes align with the train's speed and the \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) factor?\n  - Yes, it all checks out.\n\n### **Alternative Approach:**\n\n- **Idea:**\n  - Another way to approach this would be to convert the car's speed to miles per hour and then calculate the distance based on that speed.\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - If the car travels at \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the train's speed, and the train's speed is 80 mph, then the car's speed in mph would be:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{3}{4} \\times 80 \\text{ mph} = 60 \\text{ mph}\n    \\]\n  - Now, converting 20 minutes to hours:\n    \\[\n    20 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{20}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours}\n    \\]\n  - Using the distance formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Distance} = 60 \\text{ mph} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ hours} = 20 \\text{ miles}\n    \\]\n  \n- **Check:**\n  - This alternative approach also gives us 20 miles, confirming the original method's correctness.\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Consistency:**\n  - Both methods\u2014converting the train's speed to miles per minute and calculating directly in mph\u2014yield the same result: the car travels 20 miles in 20 minutes.\n\n- **Confidence in the Answer:**\n  - Given that multiple strategies lead to the same conclusion, I'm confident that the car travels **20 miles** in 20 minutes.\n\n- **Lesson Learned:**\n  - It's beneficial to brainstorm different strategies and verify the result through multiple approaches. This ensures accuracy and builds confidence in the solution.\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration helps in understanding how to approach and solve such problems comprehensively!",
