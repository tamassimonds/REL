Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll begin:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with a burger that weighs **120 grams**, out of which **30 grams** are filler. The question asks for the **percent of the burger that is not filler**.\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:**\n  - I remember dealing with percentages in weight problems before.\n  - It seems straightforward\u2014find out what part of the burger's weight is filler and then determine the non-filler part as a percentage of the total.\n  - Maybe I can subtract the filler weight from the total weight and then find the percentage of that remaining weight.\n  \n- **Uncertainty:**\n  - **Wait**, is there a specific formula for calculating percentages that I should use here?\n  - I also recall that sometimes, setting up a proportion can be useful.\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - Both subtraction and setting up a proportion seem viable. Let me think through each to see which feels more straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Subtraction Method**\n\n1. **Thinking:** \n   - Subtract the weight of the filler from the total weight to find the weight that is not filler.\n   - Then, calculate what percentage this non-filler weight is of the total weight.\n\n2. **Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight} - \\text{Filler weight} = 120 \\, \\text{grams} - 30 \\, \\text{grams} = 90 \\, \\text{grams}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Reflection:**\n   - **That makes sense.** We're left with 90 grams that aren't filler.\n   - Now, to find the percentage, I need to see what part 90 grams is of the total 120 grams.\n\n**Strategy 2: Proportion Method**\n\n1. **Thinking:**\n   - Set up a proportion where the non-filler weight is to the total weight as the percentage is to 100%.\n   - This might give a direct relationship without needing to subtract first.\n\n2. **Calculation:**\n   - I would express it as:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\text{Non-filler weight}}{\\text{Total weight}} = \\frac{X}{100}\n     \\]\n   - Where X is the percentage of the non-filler weight.\n\n3. **Reflection:**\n   - **Hmm,** I still need to know the non-filler weight to set this up.\n   - So, I'll need the subtraction method anyway to find the non-filler weight.\n\n4. **Decision:**\n   - **Ah,** perhaps starting with subtraction is more intuitive here, then using proportion to double-check.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with the Subtraction Method**\n\nLet's finalize the subtraction approach:\n\n1. **Calculation Recap:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Non-filler weight} = 120 \\, \\text{grams} - 30 \\, \\text{grams} = 90 \\, \\text{grams}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the Percentage:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{Non-filler weight}}{\\text{Total weight}} \\times 100 = \\frac{90}{120} \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Simplifying the Fraction:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{90}{120} = \\frac{3}{4}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Calculating the Percentage:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\times 100 = 75\\%\n   \\]\n\n5. **Quick Check:**\n   - **Does this make sense?** \n   - If 30 grams are filler, that\u2019s one-fourth of 120 grams. So, three-fourths should be non-filler, which is 75%.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Seems correct.** The math checks out, and the percentage aligns with the logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Double-Checking with the Proportion Method**\n\nJust to be thorough, let\u2019s apply the proportion method to ensure consistency:\n\n1. **Setting Up the Proportion:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{90}{120} = \\frac{X}{100}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Solving for X:**\n   \\[\n   90 \\times 100 = 120 \\times X \\implies 9000 = 120X \\implies X = \\frac{9000}{120} = 75\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - **X** represents the percentage of the non-filler weight, which is **75%**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Perfect!** Both methods agree. This reinforces the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Confident in the Answer:** Using both strategies led to the same result\u201475% of the burger's weight is not filler.\n- **Lesson Learned:** Sometimes, it\u2019s beneficial to brainstorm different methods and double-check using an alternative approach. It ensures accuracy, especially when dealing with percentages and weights.\n- **Next Steps:** Always consider verifying your solution by applying a different method to catch any potential mistakes.\n\n---\n\nAnd there you have it! By exploring various strategies and reflecting at each step, I've ensured a thorough and accurate solution to the problem.",
