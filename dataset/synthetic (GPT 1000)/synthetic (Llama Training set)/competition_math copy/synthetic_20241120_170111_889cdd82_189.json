Logarithm rules might help simplify the expression.\n  \n- **Exponents and Roots:** Since \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) is involved, perhaps recalling how square roots relate to exponents could be useful.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure yet which path is the best. Let's explore different strategies and see where they lead.\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Strategy 1 \u2013 Expressing \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) in Exponential Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I know that \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) can be written as \\(7^{1/2}\\). This might help because logarithms and exponents are closely related.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\log_7 \\sqrt{7} = \\log_7 (7^{1/2})\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This seems like a good start. By expressing \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) as an exponent, I can apply logarithm properties.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Use the power rule of logarithms, which states \\(\\log_b (a^n) = n \\cdot \\log_b a\\).\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Power Rule of Logarithms**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\log_7 (7^{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\log_7 7\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I recall that \\(\\log_b b = 1\\) because any number raised to 1 is itself. So, \\(\\log_7 7 = 1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, let me double-check: \\(\\log_7 7\\) should indeed be 1 because \\(7^1 = 7\\). That makes sense.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Multiply \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) by \\(1\\).\n\n### **Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Final Result:**\n\\[\n\\log_7 \\sqrt{7} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n### **Step 5: Checking the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- So, \\(\\log_7 \\sqrt{7} = \\frac{1}{2}\\). Let me reflect on this: Does it make sense?\n\n- If \\(\\log_7 \\sqrt{7} = \\frac{1}{2}\\), then raising \\(7\\) to the power of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) should give me \\(\\sqrt{7}\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\\[\n7^{1/2} = \\sqrt{7}\n\\]\n- This aligns with the original problem, so the answer seems correct.\n\n### **Step 6: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe using the change of base formula or numerical approximation?\n\n**Strategy 2: Change of Base Formula:**\n\\[\n\\log_7 \\sqrt{7} = \\frac{\\log \\sqrt{7}}{\\log 7}\n\\]\n  \n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\log \\sqrt{7} = \\frac{1}{2} \\log 7\n\\]\n  \nSo,\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\log 7}{\\log 7} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This also gives \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), confirming our initial approach.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Conclude that both methods lead to the same result.\n\n### **Step 7: Final Reflection andConclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- By expressing \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) in exponential form, applying the power rule, and verifying with the change of base formula, we've consistently arrived at the same answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\\[\n\\log_7 \\sqrt{7} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Everything checks out: the properties of logarithms were correctly applied, and alternative strategies confirmed the result.\n\n**Lesson Learned:**\n- Exploring different strategies ensures accuracy. Even when one method works, verifying with an alternative approach can catch potential mistakes and build confidence in the solution.\n\n---\n\n**Final Result:**\n\n\\[\n\\log_7 \\sqrt{7} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]",
