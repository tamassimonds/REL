I'll write out my thought process just like I would if I were working on it myself, making sure to brainstorm, check for correctness, and pivot when something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question asks **how many positive two-digit integers have an odd number of positive factors**. \n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Odd Number of Factors:** This reminds me of properties of numbers\u2014specifically, that only perfect squares have an odd number of positive factors. I think I've encountered this before.\n- **Two-Digit Integers:** We're only looking at numbers between 10 and 99, inclusive.\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **List All Two-Digit Perfect Squares:** Since only perfect squares have an odd number of factors.\n  2. **Explore Prime Factorization:** Maybe see how the number of factors relates to prime factorization.\n  3. **Consider Non-Perfect Squares:** Check if there's a pattern among non-perfect squares.\n\n**Uncertainty:** \n- I'm recalling that perfect squares have an odd number of factors, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the only type. Maybe I should explore further to confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Perfect Square Idea**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's start by listing all two-digit perfect squares. If perfect squares are indeed the only numbers with an odd number of factors, this should give us the answer.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Perfect Squares Between 10 and 99:**\n  - Need to find integers \\(n\\) such that \\(10 \\leq n^2 \\leq 99\\).\n  - \\(n^2 \\geq 10\\) implies \\(n \\geq \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.16\\), so \\(n\\) starts from 4.\n  - \\(n^2 \\leq 99\\) implies \\(n \\leq \\sqrt{99} \\approx 9.95\\), so \\(n\\) goes up to 9.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **List of Perfect Squares:**\n  - \\(4^2 = 16\\)\n  - \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n  - \\(6^2 = 36\\)\n  - \\(7^2 = 49\\)\n  - \\(8^2 = 64\\)\n  - \\(9^2 = 81\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Total Count:** There are 6 perfect squares (16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81).\n- **Check:** Wait, does this make sense? I recall that perfect squares have an odd number of factors because their square roots are integers, and factors come in pairs except for the square root.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Perfect squares like 36 have factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. Notice that 6 (the square root) is only counted once.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- It seems that only these perfect squares within the two-digit range fit the criteria.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Confirming the Perfect Square Property**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before finalizing, let's confirm that only perfect squares have an odd number of factors.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Prime Factorization Insight:**\n  - A number has an odd number of factors if and only if all primes in its factorization have even exponents.\n  - This condition is met only when the number is a perfect square.\n\n**Realization:**\n- **Confirmation:** This aligns with what I remember\u2014perfect squares are the only integers where the exponent of the prime factorization is odd, leading to an odd total number of factors.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Validity of Approach:** The perfect square method seems solid. No need to explore other strategies like listing non-perfect squares or using advanced factorization techniques.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Count:** Just counting the perfect squares gives us 6. Does that seem reasonable? Yes, because the range (10 to 99) spans from \\(4^2\\) to \\(9^2\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The perfect square strategy is correct and efficient for this problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's double-check by considering another approach to ensure consistency.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Alternative Method:** Maybe count all two-digit numbers and see how many have an even number of factors. Subtract from the total.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Total Two-Digit Numbers:** \\(99 - 10 + 1 = 90\\)\n- **Assumption:** If only perfect squares have an odd number of factors, then the rest should have an even number.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Expected Even Factors:** If there are 6 perfect squares, then \\(90 - 6 = 84\\) two-digit numbers should have an even number of factors.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does It Align?** Given that the perfect squares have an odd number of factors, it makes sense that the majority (84) have an even number.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The answer aligns with both the direct perfect square method and the alternative counting method.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, confirming the properties of perfect squares, and verifying through alternative counting, **there are 6 positive two-digit integers that have an odd number of positive factors: 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Effectiveness:** Starting with the perfect square property was efficient. Confirming through an alternative method reinforced the correctness.\n- **Mistakes Acknowledged:** Initially, I considered exploring beyond perfect squares, but realizing that only perfect squares fit the criteria streamlined the process.\n- **Key Insights:** Understanding that only perfect squares have an odd number of factors was crucial. It simplified the problem significantly.\n\nOverall, this step-by-step approach, with continuous checking and reflection, led to a confident and correct solution.",
