    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were working through it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check if I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I see the question \\((0.\\overline{09})(0.\\overline{7})\\), I immediately recognize two repeating decimals being multiplied. My initial reaction is that this reminds me of problems involving converting repeating decimals to fractions.\n\n- **Similar Problems:** I've dealt with converting \\(0.\\overline{3}\\) to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) before. This feels similar.\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Convert Each Decimal to a Fraction:** This usually works well with repeating decimals.\n  2. **Multiply Decimals Directly:** Maybe there's a way to multiply them as decimals if they're manageable.\n  3. **Use Patterns in Repeating Decimals:** Sometimes, recognizing a pattern can simplify things.\n\n**Exploring Options:**\n\n1. **Converting to Fractions:** This seems like a solid approach since both decimals are repeating.\n2. **Direct Multiplication:** I\u2019m not entirely sure if multiplying repeating decimals directly would yield an easy answer.\n3. **Using Patterns:** I think this might help, but it's more abstract.\n\n**Choosing the First Approach:**\n\nGiven that converting repeating decimals to fractions is a standard method and has worked for me before, I'll start with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Convert \\(0.\\overline{09}\\) to a Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to convert the repeating decimal \\(0.\\overline{09}\\) into a fraction. I remember there's a formula for converting repeating decimals based on the number of repeating digits.\n\n- **Number of Repeating Digits:** Here, \"09\" has two digits.\n\n**Applying the Conversion Formula:**\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\\[\nx = 0.\\overline{09}\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the repeating part, multiply \\(x\\) by \\(10^2 = 100\\) (since there are 2 repeating digits):\n\n\\[\n100x = 9.\\overline{09}\n\\]\n\n**Subtracting the Original Equation:**\n\nSubtract the original \\(x = 0.\\overline{09}\\) from this new equation:\n\n\\[\n100x - x = 9.\\overline{09} - 0.\\overline{09}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n99x = 9\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(x\\):**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{9}{99} = \\frac{1}{11}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let's check if \\(\\frac{9}{99}\\) simplifies correctly:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{99} = \\frac{9 \\div 9}{99 \\div 9} = \\frac{1}{11}\n\\]\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, \\(0.\\overline{09} = \\frac{1}{11}\\).\n\n**Check-in:**\n\nIs this correct? Yes, because converting repeating decimals to fractions using this method is reliable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Convert \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) to a Fraction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll convert the repeating decimal \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) to a fraction using a similar method.\n\n- **Number of Repeating Digits:** Here, \"7\" has one digit.\n\n**Applying the Conversion Formula:**\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\\[\ny = 0.\\overline{7}\n\\]\n\nMultiply \\(y\\) by \\(10^1 = 10\\) (since there's 1 repeating digit):\n\n\\[\n10y = 7.\\overline{7}\n\\]\n\n**Subtracting the Original Equation:**\n\nSubtract the original \\(y = 0.\\overline{7}\\) from this new equation:\n\n\\[\n10y - y = 7.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n9y = 7\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(y\\):**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{7}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet me quickly check:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{9} = 0.\\overline{7}\n\\]\n- **Verification:** Multiplying \\(\\frac{7}{9}\\) by 9 gives 7, and dividing by 9 gives back \\(0.\\overline{7}\\). This matches, so the conversion is correct.\n\n**Check-in:**\n\nIs this correct? Yes, \\(0.\\overline{7} = \\frac{7}{9}\\) makes sense based on converting repeating decimals.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Multiply the Two Fractions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have both repeating decimals converted to fractions:\n\\[\n0.\\overline{09} = \\frac{1}{11} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 0.\\overline{7} = \\frac{7}{9}\n\\]\n\nI\u2019ll multiply these fractions together.\n\n**Calculating the Product:**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{11}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{7}{9}\\right) = \\frac{1 \\times 7}{11 \\times 9} = \\frac{7}{99}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me verify if \\(\\frac{7}{99}\\) is correct. Does this seem reasonable?\n\n- The product of \\(\\frac{1}{11}\\) and \\(\\frac{7}{9}\\) simplifies to \\(\\frac{7}{99}\\).\n- Both 7 and 99 don\u2019t have common factors other than 1, so \\(\\frac{7}{99}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n**Check-in:**\n\nIs this correct? Yes, multiplying the fractions as such is a valid approach, and \\(\\frac{7}{99}\\) is in simplest form.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4:Double-Checking the Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, I want to ensure that \\(\\frac{7}{99}\\) is indeed correct by considering alternative methods or verifying the calculations.\n\n**Alternative Method: Converting Back to Decimals**\n\nMaybe I can convert \\(\\frac{7}{99}\\) back to a decimal to see if it matches the expected product of the original repeating decimals.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{99} \\approx 0.070707...\n\\]\n- **Observation:** This decimal seems to have a repeating pattern, which aligns with the nature of the original numbers being multiplied.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes \\(0.070707...\\) make sense?\n\n- It\u2019s a repeating decimal, which is consistent with the original numbers.\n- Given that both \\(0.\\overline{09}\\) and \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) are less than 1, their product should also be a positive decimal less than 1.\n\n**Check-in:**\n\nIs this correct? Yes, converting the final fraction back to a decimal reinforces that \\(\\frac{7}{99}\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n(0.\\overline{09})(0.\\overline{7}) = \\frac{7}{99}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Validation:** Starting by converting each repeating decimal to a fraction was effective. This method provided a clear path to multiplying the two numbers.\n- **Error Checking:** Throughout each step, I checked if the conversions were correct and verified the final answer by considering an alternative method (converting back to decimals).\n- **Consistency:** The final answer \\(\\frac{7}{99}\\) makes sense both numerically and contextually, aligning with the properties of multiplying fractions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, choosing a reliable method, and continuously reflecting and checking each step, I confidently arrived at the correct answer: \\((0.\\overline{09})(0.\\overline{7}) = \\frac{7}{99}\\).",
