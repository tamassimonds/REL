I'll walk through my thought process, reflecting, checking, and adjusting as needed, just like a human would when tackling a math problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, I see the problem involves two equations:\n\n1. \\( x(x + y) = 27 \\)\n2. \\( y(x + y) = 54 \\)\n\nAnd the goal is to find \\( (x + y)^2 \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Similar to Systems of Equations:** This reminds me of problems where you have two equations and need to find values for the variables. Maybe I can treat \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) as a system.\n  \n- **Factorization Approach:** Another thought is to factor or distribute terms to see if patterns emerge.\n  \n- **Substitution Method:** Perhaps I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute it into the equations.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAt first glance, I feel like setting up a system of equations could work, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe starting with substitution or factoring would be better. Let's proceed with trying different strategies to see which one fits.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Expressing in Terms of \\( z = x + y \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe we can introduce a new variable \\( z = x + y \\). This way, the equations become:\n\n1. \\( xz = 27 \\)\n2. \\( yz = 54 \\)\n\nNow, I can express \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in terms of \\( z \\):\n\n- \\( x = \\frac{27}{z} \\)\n- \\( y = \\frac{54}{z} \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems promising because it simplifies both equations to expressions in terms of \\( z \\). Now, let's see if we can find \\( z \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating \\( z \\):**\n\nGiven \\( x = \\frac{27}{z} \\) and \\( y = \\frac{54}{z} \\), we can substitute these into \\( z = x + y \\):\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{27}{z} + \\frac{54}{z}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{27 + 54}{z} = \\frac{81}{z}\n\\]\n\nNow, multiplying both sides by \\( z \\) to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\nz^2 = 81\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n\\[\nz = 9 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad z = -9\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Moment:**\n\nHold on, the problem involves \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) being multiplied by \\( (x + y) \\) and resulting in positive values (27 and 54). This suggests that \\( x + y \\) should be positive. Therefore, \\( z = -9 \\) might not be valid in this context.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSo, \\( z = 9 \\) is likely the correct value.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\nThis method seems to work because by introducing \\( z = x + y \\), we reduced the problem to a quadratic equation that easily solved for \\( z \\).\n\n**But let's double-check** by verifying if \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) resolve correctly using \\( z = 9 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Verifying Calculations:**\n\nWith \\( z = 9 \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{27}{z} = \\frac{27}{9} = 3\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{54}{z} = \\frac{54}{9} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes \\( x(x + y) = 27 \\)?\n\n\\[\n3(3 + 6) = 3 \\times 9 = 27 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\nDoes \\( y(x + y) = 54 \\)?\n\n\\[\n6(3 + 6) = 6 \\times 9 = 54 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Another Strategy: Cross-Multiplication**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf the above method seems straightforward, perhaps I should attempt another approach to ensure robustness. Let's consider cross-multiplication or manipulating the equations differently.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nFrom the original equations:\n\n1. \\( x(x + y) = 27 \\)\n2. \\( y(x + y) = 54 \\)\n\nDivide the second equation by the first:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y(x + y)}{x(x + y)} = \\frac{54}{27}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y}{x} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis implies that \\( y = 2x \\). This is a valuable insight and provides a direct relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Let's use this to find \\( z = x + y \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating \\( z \\) Using \\( y = 2x \\):**\n\nSubstitute \\( y = 2x \\) into \\( z = x + y \\):\n\n\\[\nz = x + 2x = 3x\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( z = 3x \\) into one of the original equations. Let's use \\( xz = 27 \\):\n\n\\[\nx(3x) = 27 \\implies 3x^2 = 27\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 9 \\implies x = 3 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAgain, we have two possible values for \\( x \\): 3 and -3. Let's check which one aligns with the earlier finding where \\( z = 9 \\).\n\nIf \\( x = 3 \\):\n\n\\[\nz = 3x = 9\n\\]\n\nIf \\( x = -3 \\):\n\n\\[\nz = 3(-3) = -9\n\\]\n\nGiven our earlier conclusion that \\( z = 9 \\), \\( x = -3 \\) doesn't fit because \\( y \\) would be \\( 2(-3) = -6 \\), leading to negative products, which contradicts the original equations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThus, \\( x = 3 \\), \\( y = 6 \\), and \\( z = 9 \\) are the valid solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring Consistency**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's verify:\n\n- **Original Equations:**\n\n  \\[\n  x(x + y) = 3(3 + 6) = 3 \\times 9 = 27 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  y(x + y) = 6(3 + 6) = 6 \\times 9 = 54 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculated \\( z \\):**\n\n  \\( (x + y)^2 = 9^2 = 81 \\)\n\n  **Does this make sense?**\n\n  Yes, all calculations align, and the values satisfy the original equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying each step:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)^2 = 81\n\\]\n\nThis solution is consistent across multiple approaches, ensuring its correctness. By brainstorming, checking, and adjusting our methods, we've confidently arrived at the correct answer.",
