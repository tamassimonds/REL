    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll walk through it just like I would if I were tackling it myself, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work along the way.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, the problem asks me to expand \\( -(3 - c)(c + 2(3 - c)) \\). Then, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in the expanded form.\n\nWhen I see an expression like this involving expansion, it reminds me of using the distributive property or the FOIL method for binomials. But wait, this expression has a bit more going on with the nested terms. Let me jot down what I'm thinking:\n\n- **Brainstorming:**\n  - Should I expand the inner expression first?\n  - Maybe factoring could simplify things before expanding?\n  - Would substituting variables help to make it cleaner?\n\nHmm, expanding right away seems straightforward, but the nested \\( (3 - c) \\) might complicate things. Perhaps handling that first could make it easier.\n\n**Reflection:**\nDoes handling the nested expression first make sense? I think so because it reduces complexity before tackling the outer multiplication. Let's try that approach.\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Inner Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's simplify \\( c + 2(3 - c) \\) first. This looks like a standard addition and multiplication scenario.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nc + 2(3 - c) = c + 2 \\times 3 - 2 \\times c = c + 6 - 2c = 6 - c\n\\]\nSo, the inner expression simplifies to \\( 6 - c \\).\n\n**Check:**\nWait, did I distribute correctly? Yes, \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) and \\( 2 \\times (-c) = -2c \\). That looks right.\n\n### **Step 3: Expanding the Outer Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, replace the inner expression in the original problem:\n\\[\n-(3 - c)(6 - c)\n\\]\nThis looks like a standard binomial expansion. I remember the distributive property or perhaps FOIL might work here.\n\n**Calculations:**\nUsing distributive property:\n\\[\n-(3 - c)(6 - c) = -[(3 \\times 6) + (3 \\times -c) + (-c \\times 6) + (-c \\times -c)]\n\\]\n\\[\n= -[18 - 3c - 6c + c^2]\n\\]\n\\[\n= -[18 - 9c + c^2]\n\\]\n\\[\n= -18 + 9c - c^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, the negatives can be a bit tricky. To double-check, let me distribute step-by-step:\n\n1. Distribute \\( 3 \\):\n   - \\( 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\)\n   - \\( 3 \\times -c = -3c \\)\n\n2. Distribute \\( -c \\):\n   - \\( -c \\times 6 = -6c \\)\n   - \\( -c \\times -c = c^2 \\)\n\nAdding them up:\n\\[\n18 - 3c - 6c + c^2 = 18 - 9c + c^2\n\\]\nNow, applying the negative sign:\n\\[\n-18 + 9c - c^2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes the order look correct? Typically, with polynomials, the highest degree term comes first, so \\( -c^2 \\) is correct. The coefficients seem right too. I think this is accurate.\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Sum of the Coefficients**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo find the sum of the coefficients, I'll add up the numbers in front of each term. Before that, let\u2019s ensure the expression is in standard form.\n\n**Standard Form:**\n\\[\n-c^2 + 9c - 18\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\nSum of coefficients = \\( -1 + 9 - 18 = -10 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, let me double-check the signs:\n- The coefficient of \\( c^2 \\) is \\( -1 \\)\n- The coefficient of \\( c \\) is \\( 9 \\)\n- The constant term is \\( -18 \\)\n\nAdding them:\n\\[\n-1 + 9 = 8 \\\\\n8 - 18 = -10\n\\]\nThat looks correct.\n\n**Check:**\nDoes it make sense for the sum to be negative? Given the coefficients, that seems reasonable.\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Verification**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Initial Strategy:** Simplifying the inner expression first was helpful in reducing complexity.\n- **Alternative Approaches:** Could I have factored instead? Factoring didn't seem straightforward here because of the subtraction inside the parentheses.\n- **Mistakes:** No significant errors identified, but keeping track of negative signs was crucial.\n- **Final Answer:** The sum of the coefficients is \\( -10 \\).\n\n**Final Check:**\nLet me quickly verify:\n- The expanded form is \\( -c^2 + 9c - 18 \\).\n- Adding coefficients: \\( -1 + 9 - 18 = -10 \\).\n\nEverything checks out. The approach was correct, and the answer makes sense.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy tackling the inner expression first and then applying the distributive property carefully, we were able to expand the original expression accurately. Always reflecting and checking at each step ensured that the final answer\u2014the sum of the coefficients being \\( -10 \\)\u2014was correct.",

  "ground_truth": "Simplifying the term $(c+2(3-c))$ gives $c+6-2c=6-c$. Distributing the negative sign over the first term gives $-(3-c)=c-3$. So our product is $$(c-3)(6-c)=6c-c^2-18+3c=-c^2+9c-18.$$ The sum of the coefficients is $(-1)+(9)+(-18)=\\boxed{-10}$."
