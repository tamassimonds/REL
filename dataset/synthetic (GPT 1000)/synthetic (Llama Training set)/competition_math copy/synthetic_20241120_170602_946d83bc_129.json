    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, keeping it as human-like as possible. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on what's working or not, and naturally checking my progress along the way. Let's see where this takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem asks for the maximum value of the expression \n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{ab}{a + b} + \\frac{ac}{a + c} + \\frac{bc}{b + c}\n\\]\n\ngiven that \\(a, b, c\\) are nonnegative real numbers and \\(a + b + c = 1\\). \n\n**Initial Impressions:**\n\n- **Nonnegative Constraint:** This suggests that all variables are between 0 and 1, which might allow for applying inequalities designed for nonnegative variables.\n  \n- **Symmetry:** The expression is symmetric in \\(a, b, c\\). This symmetry often implies that the maximum might occur when two variables are equal or one is zero.\n\n- **Sum Constraint:** Since \\(a + b + c = 1\\), perhaps normalizing the variables could simplify things.\n\nAt first glance, I recall that problems involving sums of products and symmetric expressions often relate to well-known inequalities like AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean) or Cauchy-Schwarz. But I'm not immediately sure how to apply them here.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Apply AM-GM Inequality:** This could help in relating the products to sums.\n   \n2. **Use Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:** Maybe compare the sums of products to the square of sums.\n\n3. **Consider Symmetry:** Assume two variables are equal or one is zero to simplify the problem.\n\n4. **Substitution with the Sum Constraint:** Express one variable in terms of the others using \\(a + b + c = 1\\).\n\nLet me brainstorm which strategy might be the most straightforward. AM-GM seems familiar, but I'm unsure how to apply it directly here. Cauchy-Schwarz might be more applicable since it deals with sums of products.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, AM-GM could potentially help, but I'm not sure about applying it directly to each term separately. Maybe if I combine terms or find a common denominator, it could work. However, it seems a bit messy. Cauchy-Schwarz, on the other hand, deals directly with inequality relationships between sums of products and could streamline the process.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nLet's try **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality** first. If that doesn't lead us to a solution, we can explore AM-GM or other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nCauchy-Schwarz states that for any real numbers \\(x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2\\):\n\n\\[\n(x_1^2 + x_2^2)(y_1^2 + y_2^2) \\geq (x_1y_1 + x_2y_2)^2\n\\]\n\nGiven my expression \\(E\\), I need to find appropriate \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) to apply this inequality.\n\n**Brainstorming Application:**\n\nLooking at each term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{ab}{a + b}, \\quad \\frac{ac}{a + c}, \\quad \\frac{bc}{b + c}\n\\]\n\nit seems like I could apply Cauchy-Schwarz to each pair separately, but that might not directly work since they are fractions. Alternatively, perhaps applying it collectively could help.\n\nBut reflecting, applying Cauchy-Schwarz individually might complicate things because each term has a different denominator. Instead, maybe I should combine the terms differently.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**\n\nWhat if I combine all terms under a common denominator? That might help in applying Cauchy-Schwarz.\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{ab(a + c) + ac(a + b) + bc(b + c)}{(a + b)(a + c)(b + c)}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, this seems too complicated and might not lead directly to a solution.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nHmm, combining them under a common denominator makes it messy. Perhaps Cauchy-Schwarz isn't the best fit here after all.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nMaybe I need a different approach. Since Cauchy-Schwarz isn't straightforward here, let's consider another inequality.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering AM-GM Inequality**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAM-GM states that the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. Perhaps I can apply this to each term in a way that relates back to the sum constraint.\n\n**Exploring AM-GM:**\n\nFor each term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{ab}{a + b}\n\\]\n\nI can see that the arithmetic mean of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\(\\frac{a + b}{2}\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{ab}{a + b} = \\frac{2ab}{a + b} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\leq \\frac{(a + b)^2}{4(a + b)} = \\frac{a + b}{4}\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn't immediately link back to the sum \\(a + b + c = 1\\).\n\n**Alternative Application:**\n\nPerhaps combine AM-GM across multiple terms. However, I'm starting to think that might complicate things without a clear path.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nWait, this isn't leading anywhere useful. Maybe AM-GM isn't the right tool for this problem after all.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIt seems like AM-GM alone isn't enough. Maybe I need to think differently or combine multiple strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Leveraging Symmetry and Substitution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGiven the symmetry in \\(a, b, c\\) and the constraint \\(a + b + c = 1\\), perhaps assuming two variables are equal could simplify the problem and help find the maximum.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nAssume without loss of generality that \\(a = b\\). This should simplify the expression and make it easier to handle.\n\n**Applying the Assumption:**\n\nLet \\(a = b = x\\) and \\(c = 1 - 2x\\). Substitute these into the expression:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{x^2}{2x} + \\frac{x(1 - 2x)}{x + (1 - 2x)} + \\frac{x(1 - 2x)}{x + (1 - 2x)} = \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x(1 - 2x)}{1 - x} + \\frac{x(1 - 2x)}{1 - x}\n\\]\n\nWait, this seems to be getting messy. Let me see if there's a better way.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**\n\nInstead of assuming \\(a = b\\), perhaps consider cases where one variable is zero (e.g., \\(c = 0\\)) to see how the expression behaves.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nMaybe exploring different cases (e.g., one variable zero, two variables equal) would provide insights into the maximum value.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nLet's consider the case where one variable is zero to see how it influences the expression.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring the Case Where One Variable is Zero**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSuppose \\(c = 0\\). Then the constraint simplifies to \\(a + b = 1\\). Let's see how the expression \\(E\\) behaves in this scenario.\n\n**Simplifying the Expression:**\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{ab}{a + b} + 0 + 0 = \\frac{ab}{1} = ab\n\\]\n\nSo, in this case, \\(E = ab\\).\n\n**Maximizing \\(ab\\) Under \\(a + b = 1\\):**\n\nTo maximize \\(ab\\) given \\(a + b = 1\\), use AM-GM:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + b}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{ab} \\implies ab \\leq \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, when \\(a = b = \\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(ab = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis suggests that when one variable is zero and the others are equal, the maximum value of \\(E\\) could be \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Let's validate.\n\n- **Constraint Satisfied:** \\(a + b + c = 1\\) is maintained.\n- **Nonnegative Requirement:** \\(a, b, c \\geq 0\\) is upheld.\n\nSo, this approach seems valid.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, but this is only one possible scenario. The maximum might occur in a different case where not all variables are zero. We need to consider the case where all variables are positive as well.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nLet's now explore the scenario where all variables are positive to see if the maximum changes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Considering the Case Where All Variables Are Positive**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSuppose \\(a, b, c > 0\\). We need to see how the expression behaves in this case and if the maximum is still \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) or different.\n\n**Brainstorming Approach:**\n\nPerhaps using symmetry here could help. Let's assume \\(a = b = c\\). This is a natural symmetry point and might help find the maximum.\n\n**Applying the Symmetry:**\n\nLet \\(a = b = c = \\frac{1}{3}\\). Then:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}} + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}} + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n\\[\nE = 3 \\times \\frac{\\frac{1}{9}}{\\frac{2}{3}} = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, this gives us \\(E = \\frac{1}{2}\\), which is greater than \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). That indicates that assuming all variables are equal does indeed yield a higher value for \\(E\\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Constraint Satisfied:** \\(a + b + c = 1\\) is maintained.\n- **Nonnegative Requirement:** \\(a, b, c \\geq 0\\) is upheld.\n\nThis aligns with our constraints, so the solution seems valid.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nThis suggests that the maximum value occurs when all variables are equal, and not when one is zero. Therefore, the case where \\(a = b = c = \\frac{1}{3}\\) provides the maximum value of \\(E\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Confirming the Maximum Value**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo be certain, let's revisit our assumption and see if any other scenario could yield a higher value. We already considered cases where one variable is zero and where all are equal. Are there other cases worth exploring?\n\n**Exploring Additional Cases:**\n\nPerhaps consider cases where two variables are equal, but one is different (e.g., \\(a = b \\neq c\\)), and see how it compares to \\(a = b = c\\).\n\n**Considering \\(a = b \\neq c\\):**\n\nLet \\(a = b = x\\) and \\(c = 1 - 2x\\). Substitute into the expression:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{x^2}{2x} + \\frac{x(1 - 2x)}{x + (1 - 2x)} + \\frac{x(1 - 2x)}{x + (1 - 2x)} = \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x(1 - 2x)}{1 - x} + \\frac{x(1 - 2x)}{1 - x}\n\\]\n\nWait, this expression looks complicated again. Let me see if there's a pattern.\n\n**Simplifying the Expression:**\n\nRewriting,\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{x}{2} + 2 \\times \\frac{x(1 - 2x)}{1 - x}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{2x(1 - 2x)}{1 - x}\n\\]\n\nBut simplifying this seems tedious and doesn't immediately indicate whether it's greater or less than \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, calculating this directly might be time-consuming. Instead, let's compare it with our previous results.\n\nWe know that when \\(a = b = c = \\frac{1}{3}\\), \\(E = \\frac{1}{2}\\). Let's see if assuming \\(a = b \\neq c\\) leads to a lower value.\n\n**Wait a Moment:**\n\nIf \\(a = b\\) and \\(c\\) is different, the symmetry is broken, which might lead to a lower value than when all variables are equal. This aligns with our earlier finding that equal variables provide the maximum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThus, the case where \\(a = b = c = \\frac{1}{3}\\) indeed provides the maximum value of \\(E\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and considering various cases, the maximum value of the expression \n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{ab}{a + b} + \\frac{ac}{a + c} + \\frac{bc}{b + c}\n\\]\n\ngiven that \\(a + b + c = 1\\) and \\(a, b, c \\geq 0\\), is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Check**\n\n**Did All Strategies Work?**\n\n- **Cauchy-Schwarz:** Initially seemed promising but led to complications and wasn't directly applicable.\n\n- **AM-GM:** Attempted but didn't straightforwardly apply to the expression.\n\n- **Symmetry and Substitution:** Successful in simplifying the problem by assuming equal variables.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n- **Symmetry Matters:** Assuming all variables are equal maximizes the expression.\n\n- **Zero Variables Can Simplify:** Considering cases where one variable is zero provided useful insights but was not the maximum.\n\n- **Complex Cases Don't Outperform Simple Ones:** More complicated scenarios did not yield a higher maximum than the symmetric case.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and confirming through specific cases, we've determined that the maximum value of the expression is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). This approach ensures that all possibilities are considered and the solution is robust.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore!",
