    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and really think through it step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work often, and maybe rethink my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so the question is about a yogurt shop that has **four flavors** of yogurt and **six different toppings**. I need to find out how many combinations there are for **one flavor and two different toppings**.\n\nHmm, at first glance, this reminds me of problems involving combinations or permutations. But since we're only picking one flavor and two toppings, it seems more like a combinations problem. \n\nLet me jot down what I'm thinking:\n\n- **Flavors:** 4 options\n- **Toppings:** Choosing 2 out of 6\n- **Combination:** Need to multiply these together somehow\n\nBut wait! Do I just multiply the flavors by the combinations of toppings, or is there more to it?\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Exploring Different Approaches:**\n\n1. **Multiply the Number of Flavors by the Number of Toppings:**\n   - At first, I thought maybe just multiplying the number of flavors by the number of toppings would work. But that doesn't seem right because the toppings need to be **different**, and we're only taking **two** at a time.\n\n2. **Use Combinations to Select Toppings:**\n   - This feels more appropriate because we're selecting 2 toppings out of 6, and the order doesn't matter.\n\n3. **Consider Combinations for Flavors and Toppings Separately:**\n   - Maybe calculate the combinations for flavors and toppings separately and then multiply them.\n\nI think the second strategy is the most promising: **use combinations to select the toppings** and multiply by the number of flavors.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Number of Topping Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAlright, let's focus on selecting the toppings first. We have **six toppings**, and we need to choose **two different ones**.\n\n- This sounds like a **combinations problem** because the order of toppings doesn't matter.\n- The formula for combinations is \\( \\binom{n}{r} \\), where:\n  - \\( n \\) is the total number of options (toppings)\n  - \\( r \\) is the number of options to choose (2 in this case)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, so there are **15 different ways** to choose two toppings from six. That seems reasonable. Let me think: choosing just two toppings out of six, like picking strawberries and sprinkles, makes sense. \n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Total Number of Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, we need to combine the number of flavor choices with the number of topping combinations. So, for each flavor, there are 15 different topping combinations.\n\n- The total number of combinations is the number of flavors multiplied by the number of topping combinations.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{ (flavors)} \\times 15 \\text{ (topping combinations)} = 60\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nHmm, 60 combinations? Let me think if that makes sense. Each flavor can be paired with any of the 15 topping combinations, so multiplying them seems correct.\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Random Insight:**\n\nLet me think for a moment: does it really make sense to just multiply the number of flavors by the number of topping combinations? \n\nI remember that the toppings need to be different and that we're only picking two at a time, which we've accounted for with our combination calculation. \n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Flavors:** 4 options\n- **Toppings:** 15 combinations of two different toppings\n- **Total Combinations:** 4 x 15 = 60\n\nThis seems consistent. The numbers add up logically.\n\n### **Step 6: Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAfter going through different strategies, calculating the combinations for toppings, and verifying the approach, I'm confident that the total number of combinations is **60**.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThere are **60** different combinations of one flavor and two different toppings available.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout this process, I started by brainstorming different strategies, realizing that a combinations approach was necessary for selecting the toppings. I calculated the number of ways to choose two toppings correctly and multiplied that by the number of flavors to get the total combinations.\n\nI checked my work along the way to ensure each step made sense, and I verified that multiplying the number of flavors by the topping combinations was the correct approach. \n\nBy thinking through each step and reflecting on whether the methods and calculations were correct, I arrived at the final answer confidently.",
