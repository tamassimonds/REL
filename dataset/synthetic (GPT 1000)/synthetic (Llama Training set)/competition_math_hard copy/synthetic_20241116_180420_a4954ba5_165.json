    "working_out": "Alright, let's jump into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work often, and adjusting my approach as needed. This should give us a thorough, human-like exploration of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst off, let's make sure I fully grasp what's being asked:\n\n- **Given:** A triangle with two sides of lengths 6 cm and 8 cm, and a right angle.\n- **Find:** The shortest possible length of the remaining side.\n\n**Initial Thought:** \nA triangle with a right angle suggests we're dealing with a **right triangle**. It reminds me of the **Pythagorean theorem**, which relates the lengths of the sides. But, since we're looking for the shortest possible length of the remaining side, there might be more to consider.\n\n**Reflection:** \nWait, there are three sides in a triangle. Since two sides are given, and one angle is a right angle, the third side could be either the hypotenuse or one of the legs. The shortest side should be one of the legs, as the hypotenuse is always the longest in a right triangle.\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** This is the most straightforward approach for right triangles.\n   \n2. **Consider the Triangle Inequality Theorem:** This could help validate the lengths, but I'm not sure if it's necessary right now.\n\n3. **Visualize the Triangle:** Maybe drawing it could help, but I'm not sure how much it would contribute to finding the numeric answer.\n\n**Which to Try First?** \nThe **Pythagorean theorem** seems the most directly applicable since it relates the sides of a right triangle. Let's start there.\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\n**Formula Reminder:**\nIn a right triangle: \n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\nwhere \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the legs.\n\n**Assigning Values:**\nGiven sides:\n- \\( a = 6 \\) cm\n- \\( b = 8 \\) cm\n- One angle is \\( 90^\\circ \\), so the remaining side \\( c \\) could be the hypotenuse.\n\n**Calculations:**\nWait, before I proceed, I need to ensure that assigning 6 cm and 8 cm to the legs makes sense. Let's check:\n\n- If 6 cm and 8 cm are the legs, then the hypotenuse should be the longest side.\n- But the question asks for the shortest possible length of the remaining side, which suggests that one of the sides should be shorter than 6 cm.\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, assigning 6 cm and 8 cm to the legs doesn't seem right because the remaining side (hypotenuse) would be longer than both. Since we're looking for the shortest side, perhaps one of the given sides is actually the hypotenuse.\n\n**Ah-Ha Moment:**\nMaybe the **Pythagorean theorem** needs to be applied differently. Let's consider the possibility that one of the given sides is the hypotenuse, and the other is one of the legs.\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Different Assignments**\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n- Suppose 8 cm is the hypotenuse.\n\nIn a right triangle:\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\nGiven:\n- \\( c = 8 \\) cm\n- \\( a = 6 \\) cm\n- We need to find \\( b \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[ 8^2 = 6^2 + b^2 \\]\n\\[ 64 = 36 + b^2 \\]\n\\[ 64 - 36 = b^2 \\]\n\\[ 28 = b^2 \\]\n\\[ b = \\sqrt{28} \\]\nCalculating:\n\\[ b \\approx 5.29 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, does this make sense? If the hypotenuse is 8 cm and one leg is 6 cm, the other leg is about 5.29 cm. This seems reasonable because the hypotenuse is the longest side.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- Suppose 6 cm is the hypotenuse.\n\nCalculations:\n\\[ 6^2 = 8^2 + b^2 \\]\n\\[ 36 = 64 + b^2 \\]\n\\[ 36 - 64 = b^2 \\]\n\\[ -28 = b^2 \\]\n**Reflection:**\nThis doesn't make sense because \\( b^2 \\) cannot be negative. So, assigning 6 cm as the hypotenuse is impossible.\n\n**Conclusion from Scenarios:**\nThe only viable option is to assign 8 cm as the hypotenuse and 6 cm as one of the legs, with the remaining side being approximately 5.29 cm.\n\n### **Step 5: Validating the Approach**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Does the Pythagorean theorem hold with these values?\n\\[ 8^2 = 6^2 + (5.29)^2 \\]\n\\[ 64 = 36 + 27.98 \\]\n\\[ 64 \\approx 63.98 \\]\nThis is close enough, considering rounding.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding the square root of 28 to 5.29. For practical purposes, it's acceptable.\n\n### **Step 6: Refining the Answer**\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n- The question asks for the length to the nearest hundredth.\n- Let's refine our calculation to be more precise.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ b = \\sqrt{28} \\]\n\\[ b \\approx 5.291502622129181 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\nRounding to the nearest hundredth:\n\\[ b \\approx 5.29 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis matches our earlier approximate value, confirming that the approach is correct.\n\n### **Step 7: Final Check**\n\n**Checking:**\n- All sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n- The length of the remaining side (approximately 5.29 cm) is less than the given side of 6 cm, which makes sense.\n\n**Final Thought:**\nEverything checks out. The length of the remaining side is correctly calculated.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe shortest possible length of the remaining side of the triangle is **5.29 cm**.",
