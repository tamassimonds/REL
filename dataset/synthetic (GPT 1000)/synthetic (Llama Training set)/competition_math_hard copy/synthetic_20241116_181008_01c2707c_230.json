I'll start by exploring different strategies, checking our work frequently, and adjusting our approach as needed\u2014just like how a human would naturally think through a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem asks for the sum of the different prime factors of \\(150280\\). \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a prime factorization problem. I remember dealing with these before, where you break down a number into its prime components.\n- **Similar Problems:** Last time, I had to find the prime factors of a smaller number, like \\(120\\). I used division by known primes then. Maybe I can apply a similar method here.\n- **Confusion:** But \\(150280\\) is larger, so brute-force checking all primes might take time. Is there a better way?\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization by Division:**\n   - Start dividing \\(150280\\) by the smallest primes (2, 3, 5, etc.) and continue until I'm left with a prime or 1.\n\n2. **Use of Exponents:**\n   - Maybe express the number as a product of primes with exponents to see if that simplifies things.\n\n3. **Factor Tree:**\n   - Create a factor tree to visualize the breakdown, making it easier to spot prime factors.\n\n4. **Checking for Patterns:**\n   - Look for patterns or properties (like divisibility rules) that can speed up the process.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nGiven the size of \\(150280\\), starting with the **Prime Factorization by Division** seems most straightforward. However, I should keep an eye out for patterns or shortcuts that can ease the process. Let's try dividing by the smallest primes first and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Starting Prime Factorization by Division**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's begin by dividing \\(150280\\) by the smallest prime, which is 2. If \\(150280\\) is even, it should be divisible by 2.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n150280 \\div 2 = 75140\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Even Number:** \\(150280\\) ends in 0, so it's even\u2014definitely divisible by 2.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nContinue dividing \\(75140\\) by 2 since it's still even.\n\n\\[\n75140 \\div 2 = 37570\n\\]\n\n\\[\n37570 \\div 2 = 18785\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWe've divided by 2 three times. \\(18785\\) is no longer even, so let's try the next smallest prime, which is 3.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Checking Divisibility by 3**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo check if \\(18785\\) is divisible by 3, I recall that the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n1 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 5 = 29\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Sum of Digits:** \\(29\\) is not divisible by 3.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, \\(18785\\) isn't divisible by 3. Let's move on to the next prime, which is 5.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Checking Divisibility by 5**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nA number ending in 0 or 5 is divisible by 5. \\(18785\\) ends in 5, so it should be divisible by 5.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n18785 \\div 5 = 3757\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Divisibility by 5:** Confirmed since \\(18785\\) ends in 5.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nNow, let's check if \\(3757\\) is divisible by primes greater than 5.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Checking Divisibility by Primes Greater Than 5**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWe need to test \\(3757\\) for divisibility by primes starting from 7 upwards. Given that \\(3757\\) is not even and not divisible by 5, let's try 7.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n3757 \\div 7 \\approx 536.71\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, \\(3757\\) isn't divisible by 7 because the result isn't an integer. Let's try the next prime, 11.\n\n\\[\n3757 \\div 11 \\approx 341.545\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nStill not divisible. Let's continue with this approach, testing primes one by one.\n\n\\[\n3757 \\div 13 = 289\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Divisibility by 13:** \\(3757\\) is divisible by 13, giving us \\(289\\).\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nNow we have \\(3757 = 13 \\times 289\\). Let's see if \\(289\\) can be factored further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Factoring \\(289\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI recognize that \\(289\\) might be a perfect square. Let's check.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{289} = 17\n\\]\n\n\\[\n289 = 17 \\times 17\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, \\(289 = 17^2\\). This means \\(17\\) is also a prime factor.\n\n**Summary of Factors So Far:**\n\n\\[\n150280 = 2^3 \\times 5 \\times 13 \\times 17^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow I see all prime factors: 2, 5, 13, and 17. But wait, \\(17^2\\) means 17 is repeated, so we should only consider it once for the sum of different prime factors.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Summing the Different Prime Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe question asks for the sum of **different** prime factors, so we should only consider each prime once, regardless of its exponent.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n2 + 5 + 13 + 17 = 37\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAdding up the unique prime factors gives us 37. This makes sense because exponents don't affect the sum of different primes.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Repeat Factors:** We only counted each prime factor once.\n- **Correctness of Factorization:** Recalling our factorization steps, \\(150280 = 2^3 \\times 5 \\times 13 \\times 17^2\\) seems accurate.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\nThe sum of the different prime factors is \\(37\\). Everything checks out\u2014our factorization is correct, and we've accounted for each prime only once.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Verifying the Entire Process**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's quickly recap the entire process to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Approach:** Started by dividing \\(150280\\) by the smallest primes, which worked well.\n2. **Identifying All Primes:** Successfully identified all prime factors, including recognizing \\(289\\) as \\(17^2\\).\n3. **Calculating the Sum:** Added up the unique primes correctly.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Multiple Checks:** Checked divisibility at each step.\n- **Consistency:** The factorization aligns with the given number.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nEverything aligns. The process was methodical, and the answer makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter thoroughly exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying our work, the sum of the different prime factors of \\(150280\\) is **37**.\n\n- **Journey:** Started with prime factorization by division, encountered and resolved divisibility challenges, recognized patterns (like perfect squares), and ensured each prime was accounted for only once in the sum.\n- **Final Answer:** **37**.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, complete with checks and reflections, ensures the solution is accurate and comprehensive, mimicking human-like problem-solving.",
