    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and approach it step by step, just like how I'd tackle it if I were solving it manually. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 = 14x + 48y\n\\]\n\nI notice that it resembles the general form of a circle's equation, which is \\( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius. This makes me think that maybe I can complete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to rewrite it in that form. But, to be honest, I'm also considering other methods like rearranging the equation or even using calculus to find the minimum value of \\(y\\).\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Completing the Square**: This might help me transform the equation into the standard form of a circle, making it easier to identify the minimum value of \\(y\\).\n\n2. **Rearranging the Equation**: Maybe I can isolate \\(y\\) and find its minimum value directly.\n\n3. **Using Calculus**: If the above methods don't work, using derivatives to find critical points could be an option.\n\n4. **Graphical Interpretation**: Considering the geometric meaning of the equation might provide insights.\n\nLet me start with **completing the square**, as it seems the most straightforward for finding the minimum value of \\(y\\).\n\n### **Step 1: Completing the Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nCompleting the square is a technique I remember using for converting quadratic equations into a form that reveals their graph's properties. I'll try this to see if I can identify the minimum \\(y\\) by rewriting the equation in a more recognizable form.\n\n**Action:**  \nLet's rewrite the equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 = 14x + 48y\n\\]\n\nFirst, I'll group the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms on one side:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 14x + y^2 - 48y = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, I'll complete the square for the \\(x\\) terms and the \\(y\\) terms separately.\n\n**Completing the Square for \\(x\\):**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 14x\n\\]\n\nTo complete the square, I take half of \\(-14\\), square it, and add it inside the square:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{-14}{2}\\right)^2 = 49\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 14x + 49 = (x - 7)^2\n\\]\n\n**Completing the Square for \\(y\\):**\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 48y\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, take half of \\(-48\\), square it, and add it inside the square:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{-48}{2}\\right)^2 = 576\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 48y + 576 = (y - 24)^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflecting on the Steps:**  \nWait, I added \\(49\\) and \\(576\\) to both sides. That should be fine since I'm balancing the equation. Let's see how this looks.\n\n**Combine the Completed Squares:**\n\n\\[\n(x - 7)^2 + (y - 24)^2 = 49 + 576\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(x - 7)^2 + (y - 24)^2 = 625\n\\]\n\n**Now It's in the Form of a Circle's Equation:**\n\n\\[\n(x - 7)^2 + (y - 24)^2 = 25^2\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:**  \nThis represents a circle centered at \\((7, 24)\\) with a radius of \\(25\\). From this, I can see that the minimum value of \\(y\\) occurs at the lowest point of the circle.\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Minimum \\(y\\) Point**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe center of the circle is at \\(y = 24\\), and since the radius is \\(25\\), the circle extends \\(25\\) units above and below the center. Therefore, the minimum \\(y\\) value is \\(24 - 25 = -1\\).\n\n**Action:**  \nCalculate the minimum \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\ny_{\\text{min}} = 24 - 25 = -1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me think about this. The radius is \\(25\\), so extending \\(25\\) units down from \\(24\\) brings me to \\(y = -1\\). That seems correct because the circle's equation is symmetrically centered around \\(y = 24\\).\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIt's always good to double-check. Did I correctly complete the square? Does the circle's equation make sense? Let me verify by plugging \\(x = 7\\) into the original equation to see if \\(y = -1\\) satisfies it.\n\n**Action:**  \nPlug \\(x = 7\\) and \\(y = -1\\) into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n7^2 + (-1)^2 = 14(7) + 48(-1)\n\\]\n\nCalculate both sides:\n\n\\[\n49 + 1 = 98 - 48\n\\]\n\n\\[\n50 = 50\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe equation holds true, so \\(y = -1\\) is indeed the minimum value.\n\n### **Alternative Method: Rearranging the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nJust to be thorough, let's see if rearranging the equation directly to solve for \\(y\\) provides the same minimum value.\n\n**Action:**  \nStart with the original equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 = 14x + 48y\n\\]\n\nRearrange to isolate \\(y^2 - 48y\\):\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 48y = 14x - x^2\n\\]\n\n**Completing the Square for \\(y\\):**\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 48y\n\\]\n\nTake half of \\(-48\\), square it, and add to both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{-48}{2}\\right)^2 = 576\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 48y + 576 = (y - 24)^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(y - 24)^2 = 14x - x^2 + 576\n\\]\n\n**Reflecting:**  \nThis looks similar to the circle's equation rearranged. Let's see if it leads us to the same conclusion.\n\n**Action:**  \nThe equation now resembles a quadratic in \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n(y - 24)^2 = -x^2 + 14x + 576\n\\]\n\nTo find the minimum \\(y\\), we need to maximize \\((y - 24)^2\\), since \\((y - 24)^2\\) is always non-negative.\n\n**Step:**  \nFind the maximum value of \\(-x^2 + 14x + 576\\).\n\n**Calculate:**  \nRearrange:\n\n\\[\n-(x^2 - 14x) + 576\n\\]\n\nComplete the square inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n-(x^2 - 14x + 49) + 576 = -(x - 7)^2 + 49 + 576 = -(x - 7)^2 + 625\n\\]\n\n**Maximum Value:**  \nThe maximum value occurs when \\((x - 7)^2 = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n-(0) + 625 = 625\n\\]\n\n**Calculate \\(y\\):**\n\n\\[\n(y - 24)^2 = 625 \\implies y - 24 = \\pm 25\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = 24 + 25 = 49 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y = 24 - 25 = -1\n\\]\n\n**Minimum \\(y\\):**\n\n\\[\ny_{\\text{min}} = -1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThis matches our previous result. Both methods converge to the same minimum \\(y\\) value.\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nI've approached the problem by completing the square, which helped me identify the circle's center and radius, leading directly to the minimum \\(y\\) value. Additionally, I verified the solution by rearranging the equation and confirming that both methods yield the same result. Throughout the process, I checked each step to ensure accuracy, and exploring an alternative strategy reinforced the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-1}\n\\]\n\nThe minimum value of \\(y\\) is \\(-1\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Moving all the terms to the LHS, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides. We have the equation  \\[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \\Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\\]Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\\pm \\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$. Since $\\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a negative sign in front of the square root. Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(x-7)^2$. Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$. At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=-\\sqrt{625}+24=-1$. Thus, the minimum $y$ value is $\\boxed{-1}$.\n\n--OR--\n\nSimilar to the solution above, we can complete the square to get the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$. This equation describes a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $\\sqrt{625}=25$. The minimum value of $y$ is achieved at the point on the bottom of the circle, which is located at $(7,24-25)=(7,-1)$. Thus, the minimum value of $y$ is $\\boxed{-1}$."
