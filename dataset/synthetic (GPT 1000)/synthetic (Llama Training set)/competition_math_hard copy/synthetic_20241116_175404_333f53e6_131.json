    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, reflecting and brainstorming as we go along to ensure our approach is correct. I'll document my thought process, explore different strategies, and make adjustments as needed, just like how a human would naturally solve a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see several components:\n\n1. **Three math teams** with different numbers of students (5, 7, and 8).\n2. **Each team has two co-captains.**\n3. A need to **randomly select a team** and then **randomly select two members** from that team.\n4. The goal is to find the **probability that both selected members are co-captains.**\n\nInitially, I think this involves probability and maybe combinations since we're dealing with selecting teams and members. It reminds me of problems where you need to calculate the likelihood of certain members being chosen.\n\nBut then, I'm not entirely sure how to integrate the selection of the team with the selection of the members. Maybe I need to consider the probability at each step\u2014first selecting the team and then the co-captains from that team.\n\n**Wait, maybe I should visualize it.** Perhaps drawing a tree diagram could help, but that might get messy with multiple teams. **Hmm, alternatively, I could think about it in terms of weighted probabilities since we're dealing with different-sized teams.**\n\nLet me jot down what I'm thinking:\n\n- **Option 1:** Calculate the probability for each team individually and then average them based on their sizes.\n- **Option 2:** Use conditional probabilities\u2014first find the probability of selecting a team, then within that team, the probability of selecting the co-captains.\n\n**Oh! This reminds me of problems where you have dependent events.** The selection of the two members is dependent on the team being chosen first.\n\nI think I'll start with **Option 2**, as it seems more structured\u2014dealing with conditional probabilities step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Selection Process**\n\nBefore diving into calculations, let me clarify the selection process:\n\n1. **Select a Team:** Each team has an equal probability of being selected.\n2. **Select Two Members from the Selected Team:** From the chosen team, we pick two members at random.\n\n**Hmm, the key here is to ensure that both selected members are co-captains.** That means within the selected team, the probability of choosing two specific members (the co-captains) needs to be calculated.\n\nI realize now that I'll need to calculate the probability separately for each team and then combine these probabilities based on the likelihood of each team being selected.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Probability for Each Team**\n\n#### **Team 1: 5 Students, 2 Co-Captains**\n\n- **Probability of selecting Team 1:** \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) (since each team has an equal chance)\n- **Probability of selecting the two co-captains from Team 1:**\n  \n  Here, I need to find the probability of randomly selecting the two co-captains out of five members.\n\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{both are co-captains | Team 1}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total possible outcomes}}\n  \\]\n\n  - **Favorable outcomes:** There's only one way to select both co-captains.\n  - **Total outcomes:** The number of ways to select two members from five is \\( \\binom{5}{2} = 10 \\).\n\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{both are co-captains | Team 1}) = \\frac{1}{10}\n  \\]\n\n- **Combined probability for Team 1:**\n\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Team 1 and both are co-captains}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{30}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** That seems logical. The probability accounts for both selecting the correct team and then selecting the correct members within that team.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Doing the Same for Team 2 (7 Students, 2 Co-Captains)**\n\n- **Probability of selecting Team 2:** \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n- **Probability of selecting the two co-captains from Team 2:**\n  \n  \\[\n  P(\\text{both are co-captains | Team 2}) = \\frac{1}{\\binom{7}{2}} = \\frac{1}{21}\n  \\]\n  \n  Here, \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\) is the total number of ways to select two members from seven.\n\n- **Combined probability for Team 2:**\n\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Team 2 and both are co-captains}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{21} = \\frac{1}{63}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:** A quick check shows that \\( \\frac{1}{21} \\) makes sense because there are more combinations in Team 2 compared to Team 1.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Calculating for Team 3 (8 Students, 2 Co-Captains)**\n\n- **Probability of selecting Team 3:** \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n- **Probability of selecting the two co-captains from Team 3:**\n  \n  \\[\n  P(\\text{both are co-captains | Team 3}) = \\frac{1}{\\binom{8}{2}} = \\frac{1}{28}\n  \\]\n  \n  Here, \\( \\binom{8}{2} = 28 \\).\n\n- **Combined probability for Team 3:**\n\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Team 3 and both are co-captains}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{28} = \\frac{1}{84}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Again, this seems reasonable. The larger team has more possible combinations, making it less likely to randomly select both co-captains.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Summing Up the Probabilities**\n\nNow, I need to **combine the three probabilities** since selecting each team is mutually exclusive:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Both are co-captains}) = \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{63} + \\frac{1}{84}\n\\]\n\n**Hmm, adding these fractions directly might be tricky. Let me find a common denominator.**\n\nThe least common multiple of 30, 63, and 84 is 1260. Let's convert each fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{42}{1260}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{63} = \\frac{20}{1260}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{84} = \\frac{15}{1260}\n\\]\n\n**Adding them up:**\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{42}{1260} + \\frac{20}{1260} + \\frac{15}{1260} = \\frac{77}{1260}\n\\]\n\n**Wait, let me simplify this fraction.**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{77}{1260} = \\frac{11}{180}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** The fraction simplifies nicely, and \\( \\frac{11}{180} \\) seems reasonable as a probability.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verification and Reflection**\n\nLet me verify the approach to ensure correctness:\n\n- **Each step follows a logical sequence:** Probability of selecting a team, followed by the probability of selecting the co-captains within that team.\n- **All probabilities sum up correctly:** The final probability is a simplified fraction.\n- **Proportions make sense:** Larger teams have lower probabilities for both co-captains being selected, which aligns with intuition.\n\n**Random Insight:** Thinking back, this problem is similar to those involving conditional probabilities and the law of total probability. By breaking it down team by team, I ensured that each scenario was accounted for.\n\n**Ahh, I remember in similar problems, overlooking one team's probability can lead to an incorrect final answer. Glad I double-checked each step.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully considering each team's selection process and summing their probabilities, **the probability that both people receiving books are co-captains is \\( \\frac{11}{180} \\).**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the calculations, I arrived at the correct probability. Documenting the thought process helped in identifying and correcting any potential missteps along the way, ensuring a thorough and accurate solution.",

There are $\\dbinom{n}{2}$ ways to choose a pair of those students to give books to, but only one of those pairs will be the two co-captains, which means that once I have selected that team, the probability that I give books to the co-captains is $$\\dfrac{1}{\\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}}=\\dfrac{2}{n(n-1)}.$$Since the teams have $5,$ $7,$ and $8$ students, this means that the total probability is $$\\dfrac{1}{3}\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5(5-1)}+\\dfrac{2}{7(7-1)}+\\dfrac{2}{8(8-1)}\\right)$$which after a bit of arithmetic simplifies to $\\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{180}}$."
