I'll start by brainstorming how to tackle it, then move through each step, checking and adjusting as needed, just like I would if I were solving it manually.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, we're dealing with a hyperbola here. The problem gives us the equations of its asymptotes and a point that the hyperbola passes through. We need to find the standard form of the hyperbola's equation and then determine the value of \\(a + h\\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems where the asymptotes relate to the center and orientation of the hyperbola. I think identifying the center and orientation will be crucial.\n- **Possible Strategies:** \n  - Use the asymptotes to determine the center and orientation.\n  - Write the equation of the hyperbola in terms of its center, semi-major axis, and semi-minor axis.\n  - Substitute the given point into the hyperbola's equation to find specific values.\n\n**Wait a Minute...** Before jumping in, let me recall how the asymptotes relate to the hyperbola's parameters. For hyperbolas, the asymptotes are lines that pass through the center and are related to the slopes defined by \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) or \\( \\frac{b}{a} \\), depending on the orientation.\n\n**Checking Approach:** Does this align with what I know? Yes, identifying the center and using the asymptotes' slopes should help determine the hyperbola's orientation and equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Center of the Hyperbola**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe asymptotes for a hyperbola are usually centered at \\( (h, k) \\). The given asymptotes are:\n- \\( y = 2x + 5 \\)\n- \\( y = -2x + 1 \\)\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nTo find the center, \\( (h, k) \\), I can determine the point where these two lines intersect. The intersection point will be the center of the hyperbola.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's set the two equations equal to each other to find the intersection:\n\n\\[\n2x + 5 = -2x + 1\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(x\\):**\n\n\\[\n2x + 2x = 1 - 5 \\\\\n4x = -4 \\\\\nx = -1\n\\]\n\n**Finding \\(y\\):**\n\nSubstitute \\(x = -1\\) back into one of the equations:\n\n\\[\ny = 2(-1) + 5 = -2 + 5 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Result:**\n\nThe center of the hyperbola is \\( (-1, 3) \\).\n\n**Reflection:** \nWait, did I check if this makes sense? Yes, the intersection point logically serves as the center for the hyperbola, aligning with what I expect. \n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Orientation and Slopes of the Asymptotes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe slopes of the asymptotes give clues about the hyperbola's orientation and the relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n**Given Asymptotes:**\n- \\( y = 2x + 5 \\) \u2192 slope \\( m_1 = 2 \\)\n- \\( y = -2x + 1 \\) \u2192 slope \\( m_2 = -2 \\)\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nFor hyperbolas centered at \\( (h, k) \\), the slopes of the asymptotes are given by:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -\\frac{a}{b}\n\\]\n\nGiven the slopes are \\(2\\) and \\(-2\\), we can set up the following relationship:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Wait, that can't be right...** Actually, **No**, that doesn't seem to align because normally, the slopes relate to \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) or \\( \\frac{b}{a} \\), depending on whether the hyperbola opens vertically or horizontally. But here, both slopes are the same in magnitude but opposite in sign, which suggests something different.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nMaybe I should consider that the asymptotes for a hyperbola centered at \\( (h, k) \\) are given by:\n\n\\[\ny - k = \\pm \\frac{a}{b}(x - h)\n\\]\n\nGiven both asymptotes have the same slope magnitude, it implies that \\( \\frac{a}{b} = 2 \\) and \\( \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{2} \\), but that seems incorrect because it leads to a contradiction.\n\n**Checking Consistency:**\n\nWait a minute... If \\( \\frac{a}{b} = 2 \\), then \\(a = 2b\\). Let's see if this holds up with the given point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Writing the Equation of the Hyperbola**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the center \\( (-1, 3) \\) and the relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (\\(a = 2b\\)), I can write the standard form of the hyperbola's equation. However, I need to determine whether it is vertical or horizontal.\n\n**Given:**\n- Asymptotes: \\( y = 2x + 5 \\) and \\( y = -2x + 1 \\)\n- Center: \\( (-1, 3) \\)\n- Relationship: \\( a = 2b \\)\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nFor hyperbolas:\n- **Horizontal:** \\( \\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} - \\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} = 1 \\)\n- **Vertical:** \\( \\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1 \\)\n\nGiven the slopes of the asymptotes are \\( \\pm 2 \\), and knowing that for a horizontal hyperbola the asymptotes are \\( y = k \\pm \\frac{a}{b}(x - h) \\), I can deduce that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = 2 \\implies \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**But Wait...** Earlier, I was confused about this relationship. Let's see if it makes sense here.\n\n**Does This Align?**\n- If \\( \\frac{a}{b} = 2 \\), then \\( a = 2b \\).\n- Therefore, \\( \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n**Rechecking Understanding:**\n\nIs this consistent? Yes, because for a horizontal hyperbola, the asymptotes' slopes are related to \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\). Since \\( \\frac{a}{b} = 2 \\), the slopes \\( \\pm 2 \\) make sense.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe hyperbola is **horizontal**.\n\n**Now, Let's Write the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x + 1)^2}{b^2} - \\frac{(y - 3)^2}{(2b)^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x + 1)^2}{b^2} - \\frac{(y - 3)^2}{4b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Alternative Approach:** \nWait, perhaps it's better to express \\(b\\) in terms of \\(a\\). Given \\(a = 2b\\), we can write \\(b = \\frac{a}{2}\\). Substituting this into the equation could simplify things.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed with \\(b\\) as is and see if it works with the given point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Substituting the Given Point into the Hyperbola's Equation**\n\n**Given Point:**\n\nThe hyperbola passes through \\( (0, 7) \\).\n\n**Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(0 + 1)^2}{b^2} - \\frac{(7 - 3)^2}{4b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{b^2} - \\frac{16}{4b^2} = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{b^2} - \\frac{4}{b^2} = 1 \\\\\n-\\frac{3}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(b^2\\):**\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{3}{b^2} = 1 \\\\\nb^2 = -3\n\\]\n\n**Hmm...** Wait, a negative value for \\(b^2\\)? That doesn't make sense because \\(b\\) must be a positive real number (\\(b > 0\\)). \n\n**Red Flag:**\n\nThis indicates something is off with the previous steps. Maybe the relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is incorrect, or the orientation assumption is wrong.\n\n**Let Me Think:**\n\nI originally deduced that the hyperbola is horizontal and that \\( \\frac{a}{b} = 2 \\). But given the slopes of the asymptotes are both \\( \\pm 2 \\), perhaps the hyperbola is actually **vertical**. \n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\nIf the hyperbola is vertical, the asymptotes would be:\n\n\\[\ny = k \\pm \\frac{a}{b}(x - h)\n\\]\n\nGiven the slopes are \\( \\pm 2 \\), this would imply:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} = 2 \\implies a = 2b\n\\]\n\n**Rechecking Everything:**\n\nIs this consistent? Yes, if \\( \\frac{a}{b} = 2 \\), then the hyperbola is vertical, and the asymptotes' slopes would indeed be \\( \\pm 2 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe hyperbola is **vertical**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Correcting the Hyperbola's Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that we determined the hyperbola is vertical, let's correctly write the equation using the center and the relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n**Given:**\n- Center: \\( (h, k) = (-1, 3) \\)\n- Asymptotes: \\( y = 2x + 5 \\) and \\( y = -2x + 1 \\)\n- Relationship: \\( a = 2b \\)\n\n**Standard Form for a Vertical Hyperbola:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(y - 3)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x + 1)^2}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\n**But Wait...** Given \\( a = 2b \\), let's substitute this into the equation to see how it looks.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(y - 3)^2}{(2b)^2} - \\frac{(x + 1)^2}{b^2} = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{(y - 3)^2}{4b^2} - \\frac{(x + 1)^2}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Rechecking Understanding:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, the equation aligns with the properties of a vertical hyperbola.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Substituting the Given Point Again**\n\n**Given Point:** \n\nThe hyperbola passes through \\( (0, 7) \\).\n\n**Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(7 - 3)^2}{4b^2} - \\frac{(0 + 1)^2}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{4b^2} - \\frac{1}{b^2} = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{4}{b^2} - \\frac{1}{b^2} = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{3}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(b^2\\):**\n\n\\[\nb^2 = 3 \\\\\nb = \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems reasonable. A positive value for \\(b\\) makes sense in the context of a hyperbola.\n\n**Check:** \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{b^2} = 1 \\implies b^2 = 3 \\implies b = \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Is This Correct?** \n\nYes, substituting \\( b = \\sqrt{3} \\) into the hyperbola's equation yields a consistent result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Determining \\(a\\) Using \\(a = 2b\\)**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\na = 2b = 2 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Finding \\(h\\) and \\(k\\) from the Center**\n\n**Given Center:**\n\n\\(\n(h, k) = (-1, 3)\n\\)\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n\\(\nh = -1\n\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Calculating \\(a + h\\)**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\na + h = 2\\sqrt{3} + (-1) = 2\\sqrt{3} - 1\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 11: Final Reflection and Check**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- The asymptotes' slopes align with the relationship \\( \\frac{a}{b} = 2 \\).\n- The hyperbola's orientation is vertical.\n- The center is correctly identified.\n- The given point satisfies the hyperbola's equation.\n  \n**Does Everything Make Sense?**\n\nYes, all parts fit together logically. The calculation leads to a plausible value for \\(a + h\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully considering the asymptotes' slopes, identifying the hyperbola's orientation, and substituting the given point into the hyperbola's equation, we've determined:\n\n\\[\na + h = 2\\sqrt{3} - 1\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- Initially, I mistakenly assumed the hyperbola was horizontal, which led to an inconsistent value for \\(b\\). Recognizing this error was crucial in correctly determining the hyperbola's parameters.\n- Reflecting on each step and being open to adjusting the approach helped arrive at the correct solution.\n- Always checking if the values make sense in the context of the problem ensures the solution's validity.\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and being willing to change direction when something doesn't align, I was able to solve the problem accurately.\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking through different strategies, reflecting often, and being flexible with our approach.

The given asymptotes are:\n- \\( y = 2x + 5 \\)\n- \\( y = -2x + 1 \\)\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nTo find the center, \\( (h, k) \\), I can determine the point where these two lines intersect.

Let's retrace the steps to ensure the correct understanding.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Re-evaluating the Asymptotes and Their Slopes**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLooking back, I initially assumed that the hyperbola is **horizontal** based on the slopes. However, given that the slopes are both \\( \\pm 2 \\), it might actually be **vertical**. This is where the earlier assumption led to confusion.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n- **Identify the correct type of hyperbola:** Since both asymptotes have slopes of \\( \\pm 2 \\), the hyperbola must be vertical.\n- **Rewrite the equation accordingly.**\n\n**Given:**\n\n- **Center:** \\( (h, k) = (-1, 3) \\)\n- **Asymptotes:** \\( y = 2x + 5 \\) and \\( y = -2x + 1 \\)\n- **Relationship:** \\( \\frac{a}{b} = 2 \\implies a = 2b \\)\n\n**Equation of Asymptotes for a Vertical Hyperbola:**\n\n\\[\ny - k = \\pm \\frac{a}{b}(x - h)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the center:\n\n\\[\ny - 3 = \\pm 2 \\left( x + 1 \\right)\n\\]\n\nWhich aligns with the given asymptotes:\n\n\\[\ny - 3 = 2(x + 1) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y - 3 = -2(x + 1)\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\nThe asymptotes derived from this are:\n\n\\[\ny = 2(x + 1) + 3 = 2x + 5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -2(x + 1) + 3 = -2x + 1\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis matches the given asymptotes, confirming that the hyperbola is **vertical** with the center at \\( (-1, 3) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Writing the Standard Form of the Hyperbola's Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that we've correctly identified the hyperbola as vertical, let's write its standard equation using the center and the relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n**Standard Form for a Vertical Hyperbola:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(h = -1\\) and \\(k = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(y - 3)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x + 1)^2}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nBut wait, we know \\(a = 2b\\), so let's substitute that into the equation.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(y - 3)^2}{(2b)^2} - \\frac{(x + 1)^2}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(y - 3)^2}{4b^2} - \\frac{(x + 1)^2}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this make sense?

Therefore, $(h, k) = (-1, 3),$ so the equation of the hyperbola is \\[\\frac{(y-3)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x+1)^2}{b^2} = 1\\]for some $a$ and $b.$ The equations of the asymptotes are therefore \\[\\frac{y-3}{a} = \\pm \\frac{x+1}{b},\\]or \\[y = 3 \\pm \\frac{a}{b} (x+1).\\]Therefore, the slopes of the asymptotes are $\\pm \\frac{a}{b}.$ Because $a$ and $b$ are positive, we must have $\\frac{a}{b} = 2,$ so $a = 2b.$ Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is \\[\\frac{(y-3)^2}{4b^2} - \\frac{(x+1)^2}{b^2} = 1.\\]To find $b,$ we use the fact that the hyperbola passes through $(0, 7).$ Setting $x=0$ and $y=7$ gives the equation \\[\\frac{(7-3)^2}{4b^2} - \\frac{(0+1)^2}{b^2} = 1,\\]or $\\frac{3}{b^2} = 1.$ Thus, $b = \\sqrt{3},$ and so $a = 2b = 2\\sqrt{3}.$ Hence the equation of the hyperbola is \\[\\frac{(y-3)^2}{12} - \\frac{(x+1)^2}{3} = 1,\\]and $a+h = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{3}-1}.$\n[asy]\nvoid axes(real x0, real x1, real y0, real y1)\n{\n\tdraw((x0,0)--(x1,0),EndArrow);\n    draw((0,y0)--(0,y1),EndArrow);\n    label(\"$x$\",(x1,0),E);\n    label(\"$y$\",(0,y1),N);\n    for (int i=floor(x0)+1; i<x1; ++i)\n    \tdraw((i,.1)--(i,-.1));\n    for (int i=floor(y0)+1; i<y1; ++i)\n    \tdraw((.1,i)--(-.1,i));\n}\npath[] yh(real a, real b, real h, real k, real x0, real x1, bool upper=true, bool lower=true, pen color=black)\n{\n\treal f(real x) { return k + a / b * sqrt(b^2 + (x-h)^2); }\n    real g(real x) { return k - a / b * sqrt(b^2 + (x-h)^2); }\n    if (upper) { draw(graph(f, x0, x1),color,  Arrows); }\n    if (lower) { draw(graph(g, x0, x1),color,  Arrows); }\n    path [] arr = {graph(f, x0, x1), graph(g, x0, x1)};\n    return arr;\n}\nvoid xh(real a, real b, real h, real k, real y0, real y1, bool right=true, bool left=true, pen color=black)\n{\n\tpath [] arr = yh(a, b, k, h, y0, y1, false, false);\n    if (right) draw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*arr[0],color,  Arrows);\n    if (left) draw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*arr[1],color,  Arrows);\n}\nvoid e(real a, real b, real h, real k)\n{\n\tdraw(shift((h,k))*scale(a,b)*unitcircle);\n}\nsize(8cm);\naxes(-8,8, -6, 12);\nyh(2*sqrt(3),sqrt(3),-1,3,-5,3);\ndot((0,7));\ndot((-1,3));\nreal f(real x) { return 2*x+5; }\nreal g(real x) { return -2*x+1; }\ndraw(graph(f, -5, 3) ^^ graph(g, -5, 3),dotted);\n[/asy]"
