    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle this problem just like I would if I were working through it myself, complete with brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adapting strategies as needed. Here\u2019s how I would approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's see what we're dealing with:\n\n- **Given:**  \n  - \\( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \\)  \n  - Degrees:  \n    - \\( \\text{deg}(h(x)) = 6 \\)  \n    - \\( \\text{deg}(f(x)) = 2 \\)  \n  - **Unknown:**  \n    - Find \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) \\)  \n\nWhen I first look at this, I think about how polynomial degrees work, especially with composition and addition. I remember that the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of \\( x \\) that appears with a non-zero coefficient. \n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Composition of Functions:**  \n   - Since \\( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \\), perhaps the degree of \\( f(g(x)) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) contribute to the degree of \\( h(x) \\).\n\n2. **Properties of Polynomials:**  \n   - The degree of a sum is the maximum of the degrees of the addends if they don\u2019t cancel out.\n\n3. **Solving for Degree:**  \n   - Maybe set up an equation based on the given degrees and solve for \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) \\).\n\nAt this point, I'm leaning towards examining how the degrees of \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) interact within \\( h(x) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Composition \\( f(g(x)) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s delve into the composition \\( f(g(x)) \\). I know that when two functions are composed, the degree of the outer function \\( f \\) is applied to the inner function \\( g(x) \\). Specifically, if \\( \\text{deg}(f) = 2 \\) and \\( \\text{deg}(g) = n \\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{deg}(f(g(x))) = \\text{deg}(f) \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 2 \\times n\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that makes sense because applying \\( f \\) to \\( g(x) \\) raises the degree of \\( g(x) \\) to match the degree of \\( f \\). So, \\( f(g(x)) \\) has degree \\( 2n \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nIs \\( 2n \\) the only contributor to \\( h(x) \\)? Let's see if \\( g(x) \\) also plays a role individually.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering the Sum \\( h(x) = f(g(x)) + g(x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe degree of \\( h(x) \\) is determined by the highest degree among its terms. So, we need to compare \\( \\text{deg}(f(g(x))) \\) and \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) \\).\n\nFrom Step 1, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{deg}(f(g(x))) = 2n  \n\\]\n\nAnd, trivially:\n\n\\[\n\\text{deg}(g(x)) = n  \n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( \\text{deg}(h(x)) = 6 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\max(2n, n) = 6  \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis equation tells us that the maximum degree between \\( 2n \\) and \\( n \\) is 6. It seems straightforward, but I need to consider cases where \\( n = 6 \\) or \\( n < 6 \\) to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s check both scenarios:\n\n1. **Case 1:** \\( 2n = 6 \\)  \n2. **Case 2:** \\( n = 6 \\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\( n \\) in Different Cases**\n\n**Case 1:** \\( 2n = 6 \\)\n\n\\[\n2n = 6 \\implies n = 3  \n\\]\n\n**Case 2:** \\( n = 6 \\)\n\n\\[\nn = 6  \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth cases seem valid, but I need to determine which one applies based on the structure of \\( h(x) \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes \\( g(x) \\) being degree 6 make sense in \\( h(x) \\)? Let's think:\n\n- If \\( g(x) \\) is degree 6, then \\( f(g(x)) \\) is degree \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\).\n- But the degree of \\( h(x) \\) is 6, so having \\( f(g(x)) \\) at 12 doesn't align.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, **Case 2** where \\( n = 6 \\) isn\u2019t possible because it would make \\( h(x) \\) have a degree higher than 6. So, **Case 1** where \\( n = 3 \\) is the only viable solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finalizing the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve determined \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) = 3 \\), let's double-check to ensure all conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Degree of \\( g(x) \\):** \\( n = 3 \\)\n- **Degree of \\( f(g(x)) \\):** \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\)\n- **Degree of \\( h(x) \\):**  \n  \\[\n  \\max(6, 3) = 6  \n  \\]\n  \nWhich matches the given degree of \\( h(x) \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nEverything aligns perfectly. \\( h(x) \\) has a degree of 6, which is consistent with the degrees of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Degree of \\( g(x) \\):**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies and thoroughly checking each step, we've determined that the degree of \\( g(x) \\) is 3. Initially, both \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( n = 6 \\) seemed possible, but reflecting on the impact of each case on the degree of \\( h(x) \\) clarified that only \\( \\text{deg}(g(x)) = 3 \\) aligns with all given conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Throughout this process, I made sure to:**  \n- **Brainstorm and Explore:** Consider multiple approaches to understand the relationship between the degrees.\n- **Reflect and Check:** Constantly verify if the selected strategy aligns with the given information.\n- **Adapt Strategies:** Shift from one method to another when the initial approach didn't fully resolve the question.\n- **Finalize with Confidence:** After thorough checking, confidently conclude the degree of \\( g(x) \\). \n\nThis step-by-step, reflective approach ensures accuracy and deep understanding, mirroring human problem-solving naturally.",

  "ground_truth": "$f(g(x))$ must have a degree of 6, because it will produce the term with the greatest exponent of the polynomial. Because $f(x)$ is a degree 2 polynomial, we can write that $f(x)=bx^2+cx+d$. The term with the greatest exponent in $f(g(x))$ comes from taking $bx^2$ or $b(g(x))^2$. Let $g(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x^{1}+a_0$. Then, the highest degree term of $f(g(x))$ is $b(a_nx^n)^2$, which equals $ba_{n}^2x^{2n}$. Since the degree of $h$ is 6, we have $2n=6$, so $n=3$.  Therefore, the degree of $g$ is $\\boxed{3}$."
