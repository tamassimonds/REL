    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking if my approaches are correct. It's essential to think out loud, make mistakes, and adjust my methods as needed, just like a human would.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n\n- The problem asks for the largest negative integer \\( x \\) that satisfies the congruence \\( 34x + 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{20} \\).\n- My initial reaction is: \"This looks like a linear congruence problem\u2014similar to solving equations but with modular arithmetic involved.\"\n\nBrainstorming Approaches:\n\n1. **Simplify the Congruence:** Maybe I can reduce the equation by subtracting 6 from both sides to make it cleaner.\n2. **Modulo Reduction:** Since it's modulo 20, perhaps reducing coefficients modulo 20 would make the equation simpler.\n3. **Finding Inverses:** Perhaps I need to find the multiplicative inverse of 34 modulo 20 to isolate \\( x \\).\n4. **Trial and Error:** For a practical approach, I could plug in negative integers to see which one works.\n\nReflection:\n\n- Simplifying the congruence seems like a good starting point. If that doesn't work, I can try finding the inverse or use trial and error.\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Congruence**\n\nLet's start by simplifying the given congruence:\n\n\\[\n34x + 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{20}\n\\]\n\nThought Process:\n\n- To make this easier, I'll subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( x \\).\n\nCalculation:\n\n\\[\n34x + 6 - 6 \\equiv 2 - 6 \\pmod{20} \\implies 34x \\equiv -4 \\pmod{20}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute\u2014negative four modulo twenty still feels a bit messy. Maybe I should convert \\(-4\\) into a positive equivalent by adding 20.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n34x \\equiv -4 + 20 \\pmod{20} \\implies 34x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{20}\n\\]\n\nChecking:\n\n- Does \\( -4 \\) and \\( 16 \\) represent the same congruence modulo 20? Yes, because \\( -4 + 20 = 16 \\).\n\nReflection:\n\n- That seems cleaner. Now the equation is \\( 34x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{20} \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Reducing Coefficients Modulo 20**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- Let's simplify the coefficient of \\( x \\) by reducing 34 modulo 20 to see if the equation can be simplified further.\n\nCalculation:\n\n\\[\n34 \\mod 20 = 14 \\quad \\text{(since \\( 34 - 20 = 14 \\))}\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n14x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{20}\n\\]\n\nChecking:\n\n- Reduction seems appropriate because both sides are still congruent modulo 20.\n\nReflection:\n\n- Now the equation is much simpler: \\( 14x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{20} \\). It looks like this is ready for solving.\n\n### **Step 4: Simplifying the Equation by Common Factors**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- Before proceeding to find \\( x \\), I notice that both 14 and 16 have a common factor with 20. Maybe simplifying the equation by dividing all terms by their greatest common divisor (GCD) could make it easier.\n\nCalculation:\n\n- GCD of 14, 16, and 20 is 2.\n- So, dividing the entire equation by 2:\n\n\\[\n7x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{10}\n\\]\n\nChecking:\n\n- Dividing by the GCD simplifies the equation without losing any solutions because 2 divides both 16 and 20.\n\nReflection:\n\n- This simplification is helpful. The equation is now \\( 7x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{10} \\), which is easier to solve.\n\n### **Step 5: Solving the Simplified Congruence**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- To solve \\( 7x \\equiv 8 \\pmod{10} \\), I need to find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 10 so that I can multiply both sides by this inverse to isolate \\( x \\).\n\nCalculation:\n\n1. **Find the Inverse of 7 Modulo 10:**\n\n   - The inverse \\( b \\) is such that \\( 7b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10} \\).\n\n   - Let's test small integers:\n\n     - \\( 7 \\times 1 = 7 \\equiv 7 \\)\n     - \\( 7 \\times 2 = 14 \\equiv 4 \\)\n     - \\( 7 \\times 3 = 21 \\equiv 1 \\)\n\n   - Ah! I see that \\( 7 \\times 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10} \\). So, the inverse is 3.\n\n2. **Multiply Both Sides by the Inverse:**\n\n   \\[\n   x \\equiv 3 \\times 8 \\pmod{10}\n   \\]\n\n   Calculation:\n\n   \\[\n   x \\equiv 24 \\pmod{10} \\implies x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}\n   \\]\n\nChecking:\n\n- So, \\( x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10} \\) means that \\( x \\) can be 4, 14, 24, etc. But we're looking for the largest negative integer.\n\nReflection:\n\n- Wait, I need the largest negative \\( x \\). Let's consider negative values within the modulo 10 system.\n\n### **Step 6: Finding the Largest Negative Integer Solution**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- Since \\( x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10} \\), the general solution can be written as \\( x = 4 + 10k \\), where \\( k \\) is any integer.\n- To find the largest negative integer, I need to choose \\( k \\) such that \\( x \\) remains negative but as large as possible.\n\nCalculation:\n\n- Let's set up the equation:\n\n  \\[\n  x = 4 + 10k\n  \\]\n\n- We're looking for the largest negative \\( x \\):\n\n  \\[\n  4 + 10k < 0\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  10k < -4 \\implies k < -0.4\n  \\]\n\n- Since \\( k \\) must be an integer, the largest possible \\( k \\) is \\( -1 \\).\n\n- Plugging \\( k = -1 \\) into the equation:\n\n  \\[\n  x = 4 + 10(-1) = 4 - 10 = -6\n  \\]\n\nChecking:\n\n- Is \\( x = -6 \\) indeed a solution to the original congruence?\n\n  \\[\n  34(-6) + 6 = -204 + 6 = -198\n  \\]\n\n  Now, reduce \\(-198\\) modulo 20:\n\n  \\[\n  -198 \\mod 20 = 2 \\quad \\text{(since \\( -198 + 200 = 2 \\))}\n  \\]\n\n  So,\n\n  \\[\n  2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{20}\n  \\]\n\nReflection:\n\n- **Verification:** The original congruence \\( 34x + 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{20} \\) holds true when \\( x = -6 \\). Therefore, my solution is correct.\n\n### **Step 7: Confirming the Solution and Final Thoughts**\n\nThought Process:\n\n- I started by simplifying the congruence and reducing coefficients, which led me to a simpler equation. Finding the multiplicative inverse helped me solve for \\( x \\), and considering the general solution allowed me to identify the largest negative integer that satisfies the congruence.\n\nReflection:\n\n- **Error Check:** I initially thought of multiple approaches, like finding an inverse or using trial and error. By simplifying the equation early, I avoided more complicated methods, which seems efficient.\n- **Final Answer:** The largest negative integer \\( x \\) that satisfies the congruence is \\( \\boxed{-6} \\).\n- **Lesson Learned:** Simplifying congruences by reducing coefficients and finding inverses can streamline the solving process, making it easier to handle linear congruences.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\n- Throughout the process, I reflected on each step to ensure correctness. Checking if the solution satisfies the original congruence was crucial in confirming the validity of the result. This step-by-step approach, including brainstorming, reflecting, and verifying, ensures a thorough and accurate solution.",
