    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, exploring each one, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like how I'd naturally tackle a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, so we have \\( x = \\cos \\frac{2\\pi}{7} + i \\sin \\frac{2\\pi}{7} \\). This looks familiar\u2014it's the expression for a point on the unit circle in the complex plane, specifically Euler's formula. I recall that Euler's formula states \\( e^{i\\theta} = \\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta \\), so this is the complex exponential form.\n\nBut then I see the expression to compute:\n\\[\n(2x + x^2)(2x^2 + x^4)(2x^3 + x^6)(2x^4 + x^8)(2x^5 + x^{10})(2x^6 + x^{12})\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait a minute\u2014this looks like it involves products of terms with increasing powers of \\( x \\). At first glance, this multiplication seems tedious, especially with six factors. I don\u2019t want to expand each term completely. Maybe there's a pattern or simplification I can exploit.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n1. **Direct Expansion:** Expand each term and multiply them sequentially. But this seems labor-intensive.\n  \n2. **Factoring:** Look for common factors in each term to simplify before multiplication. Maybe there's a common factor across all terms.\n\n3. **Using Euler's Formula:** Since \\( x \\) is in complex exponential form, perhaps properties of exponents or roots of unity could help.\n\n4. **Geometric Interpretation:** Visualizing \\( x \\) on the unit circle might provide insights.\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...**\nDirect expansion would take too long, and I'm looking for a quicker method.\n\n**Hmm, maybe I need to back up and try...**\nLet\u2019s start by exploring Euler's formula and see where that leads. If it doesn\u2019t work, I can switch to factoring or geometric interpretation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying Euler's Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince \\( x = e^{i \\frac{2\\pi}{7}} \\), let\u2019s consider the properties of exponents and roots of unity. I recall that \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) represents points on the unit circle, and \\( x^n = e^{i n \\frac{2\\pi}{7}} \\). Maybe we can leverage this periodicity.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's rewrite each term using \\( x = e^{i \\frac{2\\pi}{7}} \\):\n\n- \\( x^2 = e^{i \\frac{4\\pi}{7}} \\)\n- \\( x^3 = e^{i \\frac{6\\pi}{7}} \\)\n- \\( x^4 = e^{i \\frac{8\\pi}{7}} \\)\n- \\( x^5 = e^{i \\frac{10\\pi}{7}} \\)\n- \\( x^6 = e^{i \\frac{12\\pi}{7}} \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, this is starting to look more structured. Each exponent is increasing, and they wrap around the unit circle every \\( 2\\pi \\). This periodicity might help in simplifying the products.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Simplifying the Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLooking at the terms, perhaps we can factor out common elements. Notice that each term has \\( x^n \\) multiplied by \\( 2x^n \\). Let\u2019s see if factoring helps.\n\n**Action:**\nRewrite each term:\n\n\\[\n2x^n + x^{2n} = x^n (2 + x^n)\n\\]\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n\\[\nx^1 (2 + x^1) \\times x^2 (2 + x^2) \\times x^3 (2 + x^3) \\times x^4 (2 + x^4) \\times x^5 (2 + x^5) \\times x^6 (2 + x^6)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx^{1+2+3+4+5+6} \\times (2 + x)(2 + x^2)(2 + x^3)(2 + x^4)(2 + x^5)(2 + x^6)\n\\]\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...**\nInitially, this seems like progress, but multiplying out all these powers might still be cumbersome. Perhaps there's a better way to handle the product of \\( (2 + x^n) \\) terms.\n\n**Hmm, maybe I need to back up and try...**\nLet\u2019s see if there's a pattern or formula for the product of terms like \\( (2 + x^n) \\). Perhaps leveraging polynomials or roots of unity could streamline this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Leveraging Roots of Unity**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\nRecall that \\( x = e^{i \\frac{2\\pi}{7}} \\) is a 7th root of unity. The roots of unity satisfy the equation \\( x^7 = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( x^7 - 1 = 0 \\) implies \\( x^7 = 1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nSince \\( x^7 = 1 \\), we can express higher powers of \\( x \\) in terms of lower powers. This periodicity might help simplify the product.\n\n**Action:**\nNotice that \\( x^7 = 1 \\), so \\( x^{7k} = 1 \\) for any integer \\( k \\). This means:\n\n- \\( x^{8} = x \\)\n- \\( x^{9} = x^2 \\)\n- \\( x^{10} = x^3 \\)\n- \\( x^{11} = x^4 \\)\n- \\( x^{12} = x^5 \\)\n\nUsing this, our expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(2 + x)(2 + x^2)(2 + x^3)(2 + x^4)(2 + x^5)(2 + x^6)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis looks much cleaner now. By reducing the exponents using \\( x^7 = 1 \\), we've minimized the number of unique terms in the product.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Simplifying the Product Further**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLooking at the product \\( (2 + x^n) \\), perhaps we can recognize a polynomial pattern. The factors \\( 2 + x^n \\) resemble terms that could be derived from the roots of a polynomial.\n\n**Action:**\nLet's consider the zeroes of the polynomial \\( x^7 - 1 = 0 \\). The roots are the 7th roots of unity:\n\n\\[\nx = e^{i \\frac{2\\pi k}{7}} \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x = e^{i \\frac{2\\pi}{7}} \\), the other roots are \\( e^{i \\frac{4\\pi}{7}}, e^{i \\frac{6\\pi}{7}}, e^{i \\frac{8\\pi}{7}}, e^{i \\frac{10\\pi}{7}}, e^{i \\frac{12\\pi}{7}}, e^{i \\frac{14\\pi}{7}} \\mod 2\\pi \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nI remember that the product of factors involving roots of unity can yield simpler forms, especially when combined with symmetry properties. Perhaps there's a polynomial identity that applies here.\n\n**Hmm, maybe I need to back up and try...**\nLet me think: The product \\( (2 + x^n) \\) resembles factors you'd see in cyclotomic polynomials. Perhaps I can relate this to the cyclotomic polynomial for 7th roots of unity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Connecting to Cyclotomic Polynomials**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe 7th cyclotomic polynomial, which has the 7th roots of unity as its roots, is:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_7(x) = x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x^7 = 1 \\), we can express higher powers of \\( x \\) in terms of lower ones. Therefore, \\( x^n \\) can be written in terms of \\( x^0, x^1, \\ldots, x^6 \\).\n\n**Action:**\nOur product becomes:\n\n\\[\n(2 + x)(2 + x^2)(2 + x^3)(2 + x^4)(2 + x^5)(2 + x^6)\n\\]\n\nWe can relate this to evaluating the cyclotomic polynomial at \\( x = -2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_7(-2) = (-2)^6 + (-2)^5 + (-2)^4 + (-2)^3 + (-2)^2 + (-2) + 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, does this approach directly apply? I'm not entirely sure if substituting \\( x = -2 \\) into \\( \\Phi_7(x) \\) gives the desired product. Let me double-check.\n\n**Check:**\nRecall that the product of \\( (2 + x^n) \\) factors corresponds to evaluating the cyclotomic polynomial at \\( x = -2 \\) because each \\( 2 + x^n \\) represents shifting the roots of unity by 2.\n\n**Realization:**\nYes, this makes sense. By evaluating \\( \\Phi_7(-2) \\), we get the product of all \\( (2 + x^n) \\) terms.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Calculating \\( \\Phi_7(-2) \\)**\n\n**Action:**\nNow, let's calculate \\( \\Phi_7(-2) \\):\n\n\\[\n(-2)^6 = 64\n\\]\n\\[\n(-2)^5 = -32\n\\]\n\\[\n(-2)^4 = 16\n\\]\n\\[\n(-2)^3 = -8\n\\]\n\\[\n(-2)^2 = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n(-2)^1 = -2\n\\]\n\\[\n(-2)^0 = 1\n\\]\n\nAdding these up:\n\n\\[\n64 - 32 + 16 - 8 + 4 - 2 + 1 = 43\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, \\( \\Phi_7(-2) = 43 \\). This means the original expression evaluates to 43.\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...**\nLet me double-check the calculation to ensure no errors were made in arithmetic.\n\n**Check:**\nAdding step by step:\n\n\\[\n64 - 32 = 32\n\\]\n\\[\n32 + 16 = 48\n\\]\n\\[\n48 - 8 = 40\n\\]\n\\[\n40 + 4 = 44\n\\]\n\\[\n44 - 2 = 42\n\\]\n\\[\n42 + 1 = 43\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe arithmetic checks out. The final answer is indeed **43**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{43}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n**Throughout the Process:**\n- **Initially Stuck:** I considered direct expansion but realized it would be too cumbersome. This prompted me to look for patterns or simplifications.\n  \n- **Leveraging Knowledge:** By recognizing \\( x \\) as a 7th root of unity, I connected the problem to cyclotomic polynomials, recalling that evaluating the cyclotomic polynomial at a specific point can yield the desired product.\n\n- **Double-Checking:** At various points, especially when connecting to cyclotomic polynomials, I reflected if this approach was valid. Confirming that substituting \\( x = -2 \\) into \\( \\Phi_7(x) \\) gives the correct product ensured the correctness of the method.\n\n- **Arithmetic Verification:** Simple arithmetic checks were performed to ensure the final calculation was accurate.\n\n**Outcome:**\nBy systematically exploring different strategies and leveraging cyclotomic polynomials, I arrived at the correct answer\u201443. This step-by-step reflection and checking ensured a clear and accurate solution.",
