    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like I would if I were solving it manually. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether each approach is correct, and adjust my thinking as needed. Let's see where this journey takes me!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the expression \\(\\left|\\pi - | \\pi - 7 | \\right|\\), a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Absolute Values:** Absolute values can be tricky. They always return non-negative results, which might change the order of operations I'm used to.\n  \n2. **Order of Operations:** I need to carefully consider how to handle the inner and outer absolute values. It's important to process them in the correct sequence.\n\n3. **Properties of \\(\\pi\\):** I know that \\(\\pi\\) is approximately 3.14, which is less than 7. This hints that \\(|\\pi - 7|\\) will involve a negative value, affecting the overall expression.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to proceed immediately. This looks similar to problems involving nested absolute values, but I'm not recalling a direct strategy. Maybe I should explore different methods to see which one fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Evaluate Inside Out:** Perhaps I should first compute \\(|\\pi - 7|\\), then substitute that back into the outer absolute value.\n\n2. **Use Numerical Approximation:** Since \\(\\pi\\) is known, maybe approximating numerically could help verify the answer.\n\n3. **Algebraic Approach:** Try to manipulate the expression algebraically, keeping in mind the properties of absolute values.\n\n4. **Graphical Insight:** Consider how the expression behaves graphically to gain intuition.\n\nLet\u2019s start with **Strategy 1: Evaluate Inside Out**, which seems the most straightforward. If this doesn't work, I'll explore numerical approximation as a backup.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Compute \\(|\\pi - 7|\\)**\n\nThinking it through:\n\n- Since \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14\\) and 7 is greater than \\(\\pi\\), the difference \\(\\pi - 7\\) will be negative.\n- Therefore, \\(|\\pi - 7|\\) should return the positive value of that difference.\n\nLet's calculate it:\n\n\\[\n|\\pi - 7| = |3.14 - 7| = |-3.86| = 3.86\n\\]\n\nReflection:\n\n- Wait, I used a numerical approximation here. Is that allowed? The problem asks for an exact value using integers and \\(\\pi\\), so maybe I should express this without decimals.\n\n- Perhaps it's better to leave the expression in terms of \\(\\pi\\) instead of approximating numerically.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-evaluating Approach**\n\nGiven that the problem requests an exact value using integers and \\(\\pi\\), it's clear that numerical approximation isn't the best fit. This suggests that my initial strategy might not be fully aligned with the problem's requirements.\n\nI think I need to return to **Strategy 1** but adjust it to avoid numerical approximations. Let's try to keep everything in terms of \\(\\pi\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Revising Step 1: Compute \\(|\\pi - 7|\\) Using Exact Values**\n\nThinking it through again:\n\n- Since \\(\\pi < 7\\), the expression \\(\\pi - 7\\) is negative.\n  \n- Therefore, \\(|\\pi - 7| = 7 - \\pi\\).\n\nSo, let's write it as:\n\n\\[\n|\\pi - 7| = 7 - \\pi\n\\]\n\nReflection:\n\n- This makes more sense as it keeps the expression exact in terms of \\(\\pi\\), aligning with the problem's requirements.\n\n- Now, I can proceed to the next step using this exact value.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Compute \\(\\pi - | \\pi - 7 |\\)**\n\nNow, substituting \\(|\\pi - 7|\\) back into the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\pi - | \\pi - 7 | = \\pi - (7 - \\pi) = \\pi - 7 + \\pi = 2\\pi - 7\n\\]\n\nThought process:\n\n- I combined like terms (\\(\\pi + \\pi\\)) and simplified the expression.\n  \n- This seems straightforward, but let me double-check the arithmetic:\n\n  - \\(\\pi - 7 + \\pi = 2\\pi - 7\\)\n  \nReflection:\n\n- The arithmetic checks out. The expression is now in terms of \\(\\pi\\), which is good.\n\n- However, I still need to apply the outer absolute value. Let\u2019s move to the next step to handle that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Compute \\(\\left| 2\\pi - 7 \\right|\\)**\n\nThinking it through:\n\n- At this point, I need to determine whether \\(2\\pi - 7\\) is positive or negative.\n  \n- I know that \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14\\), so:\n\n  \\[\n  2\\pi \\approx 6.28\n  \\]\n  \n  - But 6.28 is less than 7, which means \\(2\\pi - 7 < 0\\).\n  \nReflection:\n\n- This implies that the absolute value will flip the sign.\n\n- Therefore, \\(\\left| 2\\pi - 7 \\right| = 7 - 2\\pi\\).\n\nLet\u2019s write it out:\n\n\\[\n\\left| 2\\pi - 7 \\right| = 7 - 2\\pi\n\\]\n\nCheck:\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does \\(7 - 2\\pi\\) make sense numerically?\n  \n  - \\(7 - 2(3.14) = 7 - 6.28 = 0.72\\), which is positive.\n  \n- So, indeed, taking the absolute value aligns with the numerical approximation.\n\nReflection:\n\n- Keeping the expression in terms of \\(\\pi\\) is essential since the problem specifies using integers and \\(\\pi\\) without absolute value signs.\n\n- Finalizing this step ensures the expression is exact and meets the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expression**\n\nAfter evaluating all steps, the exact value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\pi - | \\pi - 7 | \\right| = 7 - 2\\pi\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Check**\n\n1. **Approach Validity:** Started by evaluating the inner absolute value, then substituted it back into the outer absolute value. This step-by-step method aligns with the order of operations.\n\n2. **Correctness of Calculations:** \n   - \\(|\\pi - 7| = 7 - \\pi\\) is correct since \\(\\pi < 7\\).\n   - \\(\\pi - | \\pi - 7 | = 2\\pi - 7\\) is accurate arithmetic.\n   - \\(\\left| 2\\pi - 7 \\right| = 7 - 2\\pi\\) correctly reflects the negative value.\n\n3. **Consistency with Problem Requirements:** The final answer is presented in terms of integers and \\(\\pi\\), without absolute value signs, fulfilling the exact value requirement.\n\n4. **Numerical Approximation Comparison:** While numerical approximation helped confirm the signs and magnitudes, keeping everything in terms of \\(\\pi\\) ensures precision and adheres strictly to the problem's instructions.\n\nReflection:\n\n- The approach seems correct, and the final expression satisfies all conditions. It\u2019s crucial to maintain the exactness by expressing the result in terms of \\(\\pi\\) rather than decimal approximations. This ensures the answer is both precise and aligns with the requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Takeaway**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and ensuring calculations are kept in exact terms, we arrived at the correct solution. Constant checking and willingness to adjust the approach were key to navigating through potential missteps and confirming the final answer. The process emphasizes the importance of clarity and precision, especially when dealing with expressions involving absolute values and irrational numbers like \\(\\pi\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We begin by examining the quantity $|\\pi - 7|$.  Since $\\pi$ is less than 4, clearly $\\pi-7$ will be negative.  Hence we must negate this quantity to obtain its absolute value, which is always positive.  In other words, \\[ |\\pi - 7| = -(\\pi - 7) = 7- \\pi. \\]Continuing, we next consider the expression $\\pi-|\\pi - 7|$, which reduces to $2\\pi - 7$ in light of the above computation.  Since $\\pi$ is less than 3.5, this quantity is also negative.  Hence we must negate it just as before when taking absolute value, leading to our final answer of $\\boxed{7-2\\pi}.$"
