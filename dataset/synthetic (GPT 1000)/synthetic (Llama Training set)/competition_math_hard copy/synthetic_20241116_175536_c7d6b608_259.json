    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work often, and adjust my approach as needed. Here\u2019s how I would think through it:\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- Okay, so we're dealing with a ball traveling on a parabolic path. The height of the ball is given by the expression \\( h(t) = -16t^2 + 80t + 21 \\), where \\( t \\) is time in seconds.\n- The goal is to find the **maximum height** of the ball.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- This reminds me of quadratic functions I've worked with before. I know that parabolas can open upwards or downwards.\n- Since the coefficient of \\( t^2 \\) is negative (-16), the parabola opens downward. That means there\u2019s a maximum point \u2013 the vertex of the parabola \u2013 which should give us the maximum height.\n- I recall that the vertex of a quadratic function can be found using the formula \\( t = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the coefficients from \\( at^2 + bt + c \\).\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- This approach makes sense because finding the vertex will give us the time at which the maximum height occurs. From there, we can calculate the maximum height by plugging that time back into the height equation.\n- Let\u2019s proceed with this method and see if it works.\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Time of Maximum Height**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Use the vertex formula \\( t = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\) to find the time \\( t \\) when the maximum height occurs.\n- Plug in the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) from the given quadratic equation.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Given: \\( a = -16 \\), \\( b = 80 \\)\n- Plug these into the vertex formula:\n  \n  \\[\n  t = -\\frac{80}{2 \\times -16} = -\\frac{80}{-32} = 2.5 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n  \n**Quick Check:**\n- This seems reasonable. I expected the time to be positive, and 2.5 seconds makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The calculation looks correct. Now, I\u2019ll use this time to find the maximum height by substituting \\( t = 2.5 \\) back into the height equation.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Maximum Height**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now that I have the time at which the maximum height occurs, I need to plug \\( t = 2.5 \\) into the height equation \\( h(t) = -16t^2 + 80t + 21 \\) to find the maximum height.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Plugging \\( t = 2.5 \\) into the height equation:\n  \n  \\[\n  h(2.5) = -16(2.5)^2 + 80(2.5) + 21\n  \\]\n  \n- First, calculate \\( (2.5)^2 \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  (2.5)^2 = 6.25\n  \\]\n  \n- Then, multiply by -16:\n  \n  \\[\n  -16 \\times 6.25 = -100\n  \\]\n  \n- Next, calculate \\( 80 \\times 2.5 \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  80 \\times 2.5 = 200\n  \\]\n  \n- Now, add these together along with the constant term:\n  \n  \\[\n  h(2.5) = -100 + 200 + 21 = 121 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n  \n**Quick Check:**\n- Adding: \\(-100 + 200 = 100\\), then \\(100 + 21 = 121\\). This calculation seems straightforward and correct.\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- The maximum height is 121 feet, which makes sense given the parameters. I\u2019ll move on to verify if this approach is consistent by checking if the vertex calculation aligns with the original equation.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- It\u2019s good practice to verify that the steps taken are indeed correct. I\u2019ll check if the vertex formula application was correct and whether the height calculation aligns with expected outcomes.\n  \n**Check on Vertex Calculation:**\n- Recalculate \\( t = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  t = -\\frac{80}{2 \\times -16} = 2.5 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n  \n- This matches our previous calculation.\n\n**Check on Height Calculation:**\n- Re-examine \\( h(2.5) \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  h(2.5) = -100 + 200 + 21 = 121 \\text{ feet}\n  \\]\n  \n- This aligns with our earlier result.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Both checks confirm that the calculations are correct. The method used was appropriate, and the final answer makes sense.\n\n### **Alternative Strategies:**\n\n**Considering Different Approaches:**\n- **Completing the Square:** Another method to find the vertex of a parabola is by completing the square. I could rewrite the equation in vertex form to verify the maximum height.\n  \n  \\[\n  h(t) = -16(t^2 - 5t) + 21\n  \\]\n  \n  - Completing the square:\n    \n    \\[\n    h(t) = -16\\left((t - \\frac{5}{2})^2 - \\frac{25}{4}\\right) + 21\n    \\]\n    \n    \\[\n    = -16(t - \\frac{5}{2})^2 + 100 + 21\n    \\]\n    \n    \\[\n    = -16(t - \\frac{5}{2})^2 + 121\n    \\]\n    \n    - This confirms that the maximum height is indeed 121 feet when \\( t = 2.5 \\) seconds.\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- Using completing the square also leads us to the same maximum height, reinforcing the correctness of the vertex formula method.\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- Initially, I considered using the vertex formula, which led to a straightforward calculation of the maximum height.\n- I also explored completing the square as an alternative strategy, which corroborated the result.\n- Throughout the process, I checked each calculation step to ensure accuracy.\n- Both methods agree, confirming that the maximum height of the ball is **121 feet**.\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically, exploring different strategies, and verifying each step, I ensured that the solution was both accurate and reliable.",

  "ground_truth": "To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-16t^2+80t+21=-16(t^2-5t)+21\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-5/2)^2=6.25$ inside the parenthesis to get \\begin{align*}\n-16(t^2-5t)+21&=-16(t^2-5t+6.25-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16([t-2.5]^2-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16(t-2.5)^2+121\n\\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2.5)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2.5)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+121=\\boxed{121}$ feet."
