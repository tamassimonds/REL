    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on whether each approach is correct, and checking my work as I go. It\u2019s important to mimic human-like thinking, including brainstorming, making mistakes, and having those \u201caha\u201d moments. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see the problem\u2014**\"How many \\( y \\)-intercepts does the graph of the parabola \\( x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7 \\) have?\"**\u2014I feel a bit mixed. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a parabola equation, but it's not in the standard \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) form. Instead, it's given as \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\). That\u2019s a bit different from what I\u2019m used to seeing.\n\n- **Similar Problems:** I recall dealing with parabolas in standard form and finding \\( x \\)-intercepts by setting \\( y \\) to zero. But here, the roles of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are flipped.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Rearrange the Equation to Solve for \\( y \\):** Maybe convert it into a standard quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\).\n  2. **Graphical Approach:** Try sketching or visualizing the graph to understand its behavior at the \\( y \\)-intercepts.\n  3. **Algebraic Method Using the Discriminant:** Use properties of quadratics to determine the number of real solutions.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Before proceeding, I think it makes sense to focus on finding the \\( y \\)-intercepts specifically, which occur where \\( x = 0 \\). This might simplify things.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Rearranging the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s start by setting \\( x = 0 \\) because \\( y \\)-intercepts occur where the graph crosses the \\( y \\)-axis. This gives us the equation to solve for \\( y \\).\n\n**Step 1: Set \\( x = 0 \\)**\n\\[ \n0 = 2y^2 - 3y + 7 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis is now a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\). It resembles the standard form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Coefficients**\n\\[\na = 2, \\quad b = -3, \\quad c = 7\n\\]\n\n**Checkpoints:**\n- Does this look right? Yes, I\u2019ve correctly identified the coefficients of the quadratic equation.\n  \n### **Strategy 2: Applying the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI remember that when dealing with quadratics, the quadratic formula is a reliable method to find the roots (i.e., the \\( y \\)-intercepts in this case).\n\n**Step 3: Write Down the Quadratic Formula**\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nBefore proceeding, let\u2019s compute the discriminant (\\( b^2 - 4ac \\)) to see if there are real solutions.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Discriminant**\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4 \\times 2 \\times 7 = 9 - 56 = -47\n\\]\n\n**Checkpoints:**\n- **Discriminant Value:** The discriminant is negative (\\( -47 \\)).\n- **Interpretation:** A negative discriminant indicates that there are no real solutions for \\( y \\). This means the parabola does not intersect the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, this seems odd. I was expecting at least one \\( y \\)-intercept. But according to the quadratic formula, no real roots mean no \\( y \\)-intercepts.\n\n**Moment of Doubt:**\nCould there be a mistake in my approach? Let me think this through. The steps logically follow, but maybe there\u2019s another way to confirm.\n\n### **Strategy 3: Graphical Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nPerhaps visualizing the graph can help. Even though I\u2019m not actually graphing it here, I can think about the characteristics of the parabola.\n\n**Step 5: Consider the Parabola\u2019s Orientation**\n- Since the equation is \\( x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7 \\), it\u2019s a **horizontal parabola** (opens left or right) rather than the typical vertical one.\n- This orientation might affect the number of \\( y \\)-intercepts.\n\n**Reflection:**\nIn a horizontal parabola, there might be zero or two \\( y \\)-intercepts, depending on the discriminant. Here, the negative discriminant supports the idea that there are no real \\( y \\)-intercepts.\n\n**Checkpoints:**\n- Does this align with the earlier finding? Yes, it reinforces that there are no \\( y \\)-intercepts.\n\n### **Verification and Conclusion**\n\n**Step 6: Final Check**\n- **Discriminant Analysis:** A negative discriminant consistently indicates no real solutions.\n- **Multiple Strategies:** Both the quadratic formula method and the graphical approach suggest that there are no \\( y \\)-intercepts.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nIt\u2019s always good to double-check, but in this case, all approaches lead to the same conclusion: **the graph of the parabola has zero \\( y \\)-intercepts**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Conclusion:** \nThe parabola \\( x = 2y^2 - 3y + 7 \\) **has no \\( y \\)-intercepts**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n1. **Brainstorming:** Identified that the equation is in a non-standard form, which led to exploring different strategies.\n2. **Exploring Strategy 1:** Attempted to rearrange the equation to set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\).\n3. **Applying Quadratic Formula:** Calculated the discriminant, which was negative, indicating no real solutions.\n4. **Graphical Approach:** Considered the orientation of the parabola, confirming that a negative discriminant aligns with zero \\( y \\)-intercepts.\n5. **Verification:** Multiple strategies converged to the same conclusion, providing confidence in the answer.\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected frequently to ensure each step was correct and aligned with the problem's requirements. This approach helped catch any potential missteps and provided a clear path to the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "A $y$-intercept is a point on the graph that lies on the $y$-axis, so $x = 0$.  Hence, the number of $y$-intercepts corresponds to the number of real solutions of the quadratic equation $2y^2 - 3y + 7 = 0$.  The discriminant of this quadratic equation is $(-3)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 = -47$, which is negative, so the quadratic has no real roots.  Therefore, the number of $y$-intercepts is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\nreal ticklen=3;\nreal tickspace=2;\n\nreal ticklength=0.1cm;\nreal axisarrowsize=0.14cm;\npen axispen=black+1.3bp;\nreal vectorarrowsize=0.2cm;\nreal tickdown=-0.5;\nreal tickdownlength=-0.15inch;\nreal tickdownbase=0.3;\nreal wholetickdown=tickdown;\nvoid rr_cartesian_axes(real xleft, real xright, real ybottom, real ytop, real xstep=1, real ystep=1, bool\n\nuseticks=false, bool complexplane=false, bool usegrid=true) {\n\nimport graph;\n\nreal i;\n\nif(complexplane) {\n\nlabel(\"$\\textnormal{Re}$\",(xright,0),SE);\n\nlabel(\"$\\textnormal{Im}$\",(0,ytop),NW);\n\n} else {\n\nlabel(\"$x$\",(xright+0.4,-0.5));\n\nlabel(\"$y$\",(-0.5,ytop+0.2));\n\n}\n\nylimits(ybottom,ytop);\n\nxlimits( xleft, xright);\n\nreal[] TicksArrx,TicksArry;\n\nfor(i=xleft+xstep; i<xright; i+=xstep) {\n\nif(abs(i) >0.1) {\n\nTicksArrx.push(i);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nfor(i=ybottom+ystep; i<ytop; i+=ystep) {\n\nif(abs(i) >0.1) {\n\nTicksArry.push(i);\n\n}\n\n}\n\nif(usegrid) {\n\nxaxis(BottomTop(extend=false), Ticks(\"%\", TicksArrx ,pTick=gray\n\n(0.22),extend=true),p=invisible);//,above=true);\n\nyaxis(LeftRight(extend=false),Ticks(\"%\", TicksArry ,pTick=gray(0.22),extend=true),\n\np=invisible);//,Arrows);\n\n}\n\nif(useticks) {\n\nxequals(0, ymin=ybottom, ymax=ytop, p=axispen, Ticks(\"%\",TicksArry ,\n\npTick=black+0.8bp,Size=ticklength), above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\nyequals(0, xmin=xleft, xmax=xright, p=axispen, Ticks(\"%\",TicksArrx ,\n\npTick=black+0.8bp,Size=ticklength), above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\n} else {\n\nxequals(0, ymin=ybottom, ymax=ytop, p=axispen, above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\nyequals(0, xmin=xleft, xmax=xright, p=axispen, above=true, Arrows(size=axisarrowsize));\n\n}\n};\nreal lowerx, upperx, lowery, uppery;\nreal f(real x) {return 2*x^2 - 3*x + 7;}\nlowery = -1;\nuppery = 3;\nrr_cartesian_axes(-2,15,lowery,uppery);\ndraw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*(graph(f,lowery,uppery,operator ..)), red);\n[/asy]"
