    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The task is to simplify the expression \\( \\frac{5 + 12i}{2 - 3i} \\) and express the answer in the form \\( a + bi \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers. \n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I recognize that we\u2019re dealing with complex numbers\u2014both the numerator and denominator have real and imaginary parts. My initial thoughts are:\n\n1. **Rationalizing the Denominator:** This is a common technique used to eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator of a fraction involving complex numbers. It reminds me of how I would deal with square roots in the denominator.\n\n2. **Performing Polynomial Division:** Another approach could be to treat the numerator and denominator like polynomials and see if that leads to simplification.\n\n3. **Using Polar/Exponential Form:** Converting the complex numbers to polar form and then simplifying might work, but it seems a bit advanced for this problem.\n\n4. **Direct Division:** Attempting to divide the complex numbers directly, perhaps by separating the real and imaginary parts.\n\nAt this point, rationalizing the denominator feels like the most straightforward method. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve practiced before, and it typically works well for expressions like this. However, I\u2019ll brainstorm and reflect to ensure it\u2019s the best approach.\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Rationalize the Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nOkay, rationalizing the denominator involves multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\( 2 - 3i \\) is \\( 2 + 3i \\). This should eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5 + 12i}{2 - 3i} \\times \\frac{2 + 3i}{2 + 3i} = \\frac{(5 + 12i)(2 + 3i)}{(2 - 3i)(2 + 3i)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflecting on the Approach:**  \nMultiplying by the conjugate makes sense. The denominator should turn into a real number. Let\u2019s calculate it step by step and see if it works.\n\n**Continue with Calculation:**\n\n**Denominator:**\n\n\\[\n(2 - 3i)(2 + 3i) = 2^2 - (3i)^2 = 4 - 9(-1) = 4 + 9 = 13\n\\]\n\n**Numerator:**\n\n\\[\n(5 + 12i)(2 + 3i) = 5 \\cdot 2 + 5 \\cdot 3i + 12i \\cdot 2 + 12i \\cdot 3i\n\\]\n\\[\n= 10 + 15i + 24i + 36i^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= 10 + 39i + 36(-1) = 10 + 39i - 36\n\\]\n\\[\n= -26 + 39i\n\\]\n\n**Writing the Simplified Expression:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-26 + 39i}{13}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Further:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-26}{13} + \\frac{39i}{13} = -2 + 3i\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nThis looks good. The denominator is a real number, and the imaginary unit \\( i \\) is only present in the numerator. The numbers seem reasonable.\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s verify if this makes sense. Does \\( -2 + 3i \\) indeed simplify the original fraction?\n\n**Calculation:**  \nWe can multiply \\( -2 + 3i \\) by the denominator \\( 2 - 3i \\) and see if we get the numerator \\( 5 + 12i \\).\n\n\\[\n(-2 + 3i)(2 - 3i) = -4 + 6i + 6i - 9i^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= -4 + 12i + 9 = 5 + 12i\n\\]\n\n**Reflecting on the Check:**  \nIt matches! Multiplying back gives us the original numerator, confirming that our simplification is correct.\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEven though rationalizing the denominator worked well, let\u2019s brainstorm if there\u2019s another method we could have used.\n\n1. **Polynomial Division:** Perhaps dividing \\( 5 + 12i \\) by \\( 2 - 3i \\) directly. But thinking it through, this method might be more complicated and less familiar than rationalizing.\n\n2. **Direct Division:** Attempting to separate real and imaginary parts directly. But without rationalization, the denominator would remain complex, making it messy.\n\n3. **Using Polar Form:** Converting to polar coordinates and simplifying. This could work, but it\u2019s more advanced and time-consuming.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGiven the simplicity of rationalizing the denominator and its effectiveness, I believe it\u2019s the best approach for this problem. Other methods might lead to unnecessary complexity.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully rationalizing the denominator and verifying the solution, the simplified expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2 + 3i}\n\\]\n\n### **Closing Thoughts**\n\nThroughout this process, I started by brainstorming different strategies, settled on rationalizing the denominator as the most straightforward approach, and verified my work to ensure correctness. Reflecting regularly helped catch any potential errors early, and exploring alternative methods reassured me that the chosen path was the most efficient.\n\nBy treating the problem step-by-step and checking along the way, I consistently ensured that each part of the solution made sense, leading to a correct and simplified answer.",
