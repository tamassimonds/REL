    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and approach it like I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking if my approach is correct. This should give a natural, human-like flow to the thought process.\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, **I have the following terms of an arithmetic sequence: \\(\\frac{1}{2}, x-1, 3x, \\ldots\\). Solve for \\(x\\)**\u2014it immediately reminds me of dealing with arithmetic sequences where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. \n\nBut then, I think, **Wait, I need to remember that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between any two consecutive terms is the same. So, maybe I can set up an equation based on that.**\n\nI'm also considering different strategies:\n\n1. **Setting up equations using the common difference.**\n2. **Testing specific values of \\(x\\) to see if they satisfy the sequence.**\n3. **Rearranging terms to see if a pattern emerges.**\n\nAt this point, nothing feels too solid, but I\u2019m leaning towards using the common difference to set up equations because that\u2019s the defining property of an arithmetic sequence.\n\n---\n\n## **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n### **Strategy 1: Use the Common Difference**\n\n- **Thought:** In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms (\\(d\\)) is constant. So, I can set up equations based on this idea.\n  \n- **Reflection:** This seems like the most straightforward approach. If I can express the common difference between the first and second terms and the second and third terms, I can set them equal to each other.\n\n- **Potential Issue:** But wait, what if the terms don\u2019t align perfectly? Maybe I need to double-check this approach.\n\n### **Strategy 2: Test Specific Values**\n\n- **Thought:** Maybe I can plug in some values for \\(x\\) to see if the sequence holds. This might not be efficient, but it could give me a hint.\n\n- **Reflection:** Testing specific values might work for small integers, but \\(x\\) could be something more complex\u2014like a fraction\u2014so I'm not sure how practical this is.\n\n### **Strategy 3: Rearranging Terms**\n\n- **Thought:** Perhaps rearranging the terms to see if a pattern or simplification emerges might help.\n\n- **Reflection:** This could be helpful, but I\u2019m not sure how it directly relates to finding \\(x\\).\n\n**Final Decision:** I think I\u2019ll start with **Strategy 1: Use the Common Difference** because it's directly tied to the definition of an arithmetic sequence. If that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll reconsider other strategies.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation Using Common Difference**\n\n### **Approach:**\n\n- **Define the common difference (\\(d\\)):**\n  \\[\n  d = \\text{difference between consecutive terms}\n  \\]\n\n- **Set up equations based on \\(d\\):**\n  \\[\n  d = (x - 1) - \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  d = 3x - (x - 1)\n  \\]\n\n- **Since both expressions equal \\(d\\), set them equal to each other:**\n  \\[\n  (x - 1) - \\frac{1}{2} = 3x - (x - 1)\n  \\]\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Wait, that seems logical because if both differences are equal, then they must satisfy the sequence.**\n\n- **But let me double-check:** Does this really capture the essence of an arithmetic sequence? Yes, because the common difference should be the same regardless of which two terms you subtract.\n\n- **Confidence Level:** I\u2019m feeling moderately confident about this approach. It makes sense theoretically.\n\n### **Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s simplify the equations step by step.\n\n1. **Simplify the left side:**\n   \\[\n   (x - 1) - \\frac{1}{2} = x - 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = x - 1.5\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   x - 1.5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the right side:**\n   \\[\n   3x - (x - 1) = 3x - x + 1 = 2x + 1\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   2x + 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the simplified expressions equal:**\n   \\[\n   x - 1.5 = 2x + 1\n   \\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, now I have a linear equation in \\(x\\) that I can solve.\n\n- **Quick Check:** The equation seems balanced\u2014subtracting \\(1.5\\) from \\(x\\) equals adding \\(1\\) to \\(2x\\). This should lead to a solvable equation.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Solving the Equation for \\(x\\)**\n\n### **Approach:**\n\n- **Isolate \\(x\\) on one side of the equation:**\n  \\[\n  x - 1.5 = 2x + 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides:**\n  \\[\n  x - 2x - 1.5 = 1\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  -x - 1.5 = 1\n  \\]\n\n- **Add \\(1.5\\) to both sides:**\n  \\[\n  -x = 1 + 1.5\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  -x = 2.5\n  \\]\n\n- **Multiply both sides by \\(-1\\):**\n  \\[\n  x = -2.5\n  \\]\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Hmm, this seems straightforward. I subtracted \\(2x\\) to get \\(x\\) by itself, added \\(1.5\\) to balance the equation, and finally multiplied by \\(-1\\) to solve for \\(x\\).**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Would the common difference be consistent with \\(x = -2.5\\)? Let me think.\n\n- **Reflection:** I\u2019ll verify if this value of \\(x\\) maintains the arithmetic sequence property.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n### **Approach:**\n\n- **Plug \\(x = -2.5\\) back into the terms:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{First term: } \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Second term: } x - 1 = -2.5 - 1 = -3.5\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Third term: } 3x = 3 \\times (-2.5) = -7.5\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculate the common differences:**\n  \\[\n  d_1 = (-3.5) - \\frac{1}{2} = -3.5 - 0.5 = -4\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  d_2 = (-7.5) - (-3.5) = -4\n  \\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** The common differences \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\) are both \\(-4\\). This confirms that the sequence is arithmetic with \\(d = -4\\).\n\n- **Conclusion:** The value \\(x = -2.5\\) maintains the arithmetic sequence property, so our solution is correct.\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Does the solution feel correct?** Yes, both common differences are equal, satisfying the condition for an arithmetic sequence.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Initially, I considered testing specific values and rearranging terms, but using the common difference was the most direct and effective method.\n\n- **Reflection on Approach:** By systematically setting up an equation based on the defining property of an arithmetic sequence and verifying the solution, I ensured the correctness of the value found for \\(x\\).\n\n- **Mistakes or Dead Ends?** There were no significant mistakes, but exploring alternative strategies confirmed that the chosen method was the most efficient.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the arithmetic sequence is **\\(-2.5\\)**. By defining the common difference and setting up equations based on it, we arrived at a linear equation, solved for \\(x\\), and verified the solution to ensure it maintained the sequence's properties.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with constant reflection and verification, ensured a correct and confident solution.\n\n## **Oh No! I See I've Made an Error**\n\nLooking back at my previous solution where I concluded \\( x = -2.5 \\), I realize that the value I arrived at doesn't match the sample solution provided. **Ahh, I see I've made an error.** Let's dive back into the problem and reassess my approach to find the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n## **Rebrainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen I first attempted to solve the problem, I focused on using the common difference of an arithmetic sequence. However, seeing that my solution doesn't align with the sample solution, I should reconsider my strategy. Let's explore different methods to ensure we arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### **Strategy 1: Revisit the Common Difference Approach**\n\n- **Thought:** In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. I initially set up equations based on this property.\n\n- **Reflection:** Perhaps I miscalculated or overlooked an important detail. Let me revisit this approach and verify each step.\n\n### **Strategy 2: Use the Formula for the \\(n\\)th Term of an Arithmetic Sequence**\n\n- **Thought:** The general formula for the \\(n\\)th term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n  \\[\n  a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n  \\]\n  where \\(a_1\\) is the first term, and \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n\n- **Reflection:** Using this formula might provide a more structured way to relate the terms and find \\(x\\).\n\n### **Strategy 3: Test Specific Values**\n\n- **Thought:** Although testing specific values isn't the most efficient approach, it could serve as a sanity check to ensure our calculations are correct.\n\n- **Reflection:** This could still be useful for confirming the validity of our final answer.\n\n**Final Decision:** I think I\u2019ll start by **revisiting my initial approach** to identify any mistakes. If that doesn't work, I'll consider using the \\(n\\)th term formula or testing specific values as secondary strategies.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Reassessing the Common Difference Approach**\n\n### **Defining the Common Difference:**\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the common difference (\\(d\\)) is constant. Therefore:\n\n1. Between the first and second terms:\n   \\[\n   d = (x - 1) - \\frac{1}{2} = x - 1.5\n   \\]\n   \n2. Between the second and third terms:\n   \\[\n   d = 3x - (x - 1) = 2x + 1\n   \\]\n   \n**Setting the Two Expressions Equal:**\n\\[\nx - 1.5 = 2x + 1\n\\]\n\n### **Solving for \\(x\\):**\n\nLet's simplify the equation step by step:\n\n1. **Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides:**\n   \\[\n   x - 2x - 1.5 = 1 \\implies -x - 1.5 = 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add \\(1.5\\) to both sides:**\n   \\[\n   -x = 1 + 1.5 \\implies -x = 2.5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply both sides by \\(-1\\):**\n   \\[\n   x = -2.5\n   \\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Hmm, I've arrived at the same solution as before (\\(x = -2.5\\)).** However, the sample solution indicates that \\(x\\) should be \\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\), which is numerically the same but presented differently. This suggests that my initial approach was correct, but perhaps the sample solution is emphasizing a more precise fractional representation.\n\n## **Step 2: Validating the Solution Using the \\(n\\)th Term Formula**\n\n### **Using the \\(n\\)th Term Formula:**\n\nThe general formula for the \\(n\\)th term is:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n\\]\n\n**Applying this to our sequence:**\n\n1. **First term (\\(a_1\\)):**\n   \\[\n   a_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second term (\\(a_2\\)):**\n   \\[\n   a_2 = x - 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third term (\\(a_3\\)):**\n   \\[\n   a_3 = 3x\n   \\]\n\n### **Calculating the Common Difference (\\(d\\)):**\n\n- **Between the first and second terms:**\n  \\[\n  d = a_2 - a_1 = (x - 1) - \\frac{1}{2} = x - 1.5\n  \\]\n\n- **Between the second and third terms:**\n  \\[\n  d = a_3 - a_2 = 3x - (x - 1) = 2x + 1\n  \\]\n\n### **Setting the Two Expressions Equal:**\n\n\\[\nx - 1.5 = 2x + 1\n\\]\n\n### **Solving for \\(x\\):**\n\nFollowing the same steps as before:\n\n1. **Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides:**\n   \\[\n   x - 2x - 1.5 = 1 \\implies -x - 1.5 = 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add \\(1.5\\) to both sides:**\n   \\[\n   -x = 1 + 1.5 \\implies -x = 2.5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply both sides by \\(-1\\):**\n   \\[\n   x = -2.5\n   \\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Again, I've reached \\(x = -2.5\\).** This aligns with my previous solution but differs from the sample solution's representation of \\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\).\n\n- **Mistake or Misinterpretation?** There\u2019s no arithmetic mistake here; rather, it seems that the sample solution prefers expressing the answer as a fraction to maintain clarity and consistency.\n\n## **Step 3: Confirming the Solution by Testing Specific Values**\n\n### **Testing \\(x = -2.5\\):**\n\n1. **Calculate the Terms:**\n   - First term: \n     \\[\n     a_1 = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\n     \\]\n   \n   - Second term:\n     \\[\n     a_2 = x - 1 = -2.5 - 1 = -3.5\n     \\]\n   \n   - Third term:\n     \\[\n     a_3 = 3x = 3 \\times (-2.5) = -7.5\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Verify the Common Difference:**\n   - Between the first and second terms:\n     \\[\n     d_1 = -3.5 - 0.5 = -4\n     \\]\n   \n   - Between the second and third terms:\n     \\[\n     d_2 = -7.5 - (-3.5) = -4\n     \\]\n   \n### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Both common differences are equal (\\(-4\\)),** confirming that the sequence is arithmetic with \\(d = -4\\).\n\n- **Conclusion:** The value \\(x = -2.5\\) is valid and maintains the properties of the arithmetic sequence.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **The sample solution's representation of \\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\)** is simply a fractional form of \\(-2.5\\), which numerically matches the solution I arrived at. This emphasizes the importance of expressing answers in their simplest form, especially in mathematical contexts.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** While testing specific values confirmed the correctness of \\(x = -2.5\\), initially revisiting the common difference approach was essential to ensure no calculation errors occurred.\n\n- **Reflection on Approach:** By systematically applying the common difference property, solving for \\(x\\), and verifying through multiple methods, I ensured the solution's accuracy.\n\n- **Mistakes or Dead Ends?** There were no significant mistakes; the initial solution was correct but could have been presented more clearly by recognizing the fractional representation.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the arithmetic sequence is **\\(-2.5\\)** or **\\(-\\frac{5}{2}\\)**. By defining the common difference and setting up equations based on it, we arrived at a consistent solution. Verifying through multiple methods ensured the correctness and provided clarity on the answer's representation.",
