    "working_out": "**First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. The question asks for the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts on the graph of \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) within the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\). \n\nAt first glance, I remember that \\( x \\)-intercepts occur where \\( y = 0 \\), meaning the function \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\). This is similar to finding the zeros of the sine function, which happen at integral multiples of \\( \\pi \\). So, maybe I can relate \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) to \\( n\\pi \\) for integers \\( n \\).\n\nBut then I think, \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) gets really large as \\( x \\) approaches zero from the right, so there will be many integer multiples of \\( \\pi \\) within that range. The interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\) is very narrow, but since \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) sweeps through many cycles of sine, there might be multiple \\( n \\) values fitting into this range.\n\nHmm, I'll need to calculate how many integers \\( n \\) satisfy the condition \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) within the given bounds. Let's brainstorm a few strategies to approach this.\n\n---\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Calculation Method:**\n   - Set \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\) and solve for \\( n \\).\n   - Find the range of \\( n \\) that corresponds to \\( x \\) values within \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\).\n\n2. **Approximation Method:**\n   - Use the small-angle approximation for sine to estimate \\( n \\).\n   - Check if this gives a reasonable range for \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Graphical Approach:**\n   - Sketch the graph of \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) to visually estimate intercepts.\n   - This might be more intuitive but less precise.\n\n4. **Analytical Bounds:**\n   - Calculate upper and lower bounds for \\( n \\) without exact solutions.\n   - Ensure \\( n \\) remains an integer.\n\nHmm, the **Direct Calculation Method** seems the most straightforward, but I need to be careful with the limits since \\( x \\) is very small. The **Approximation Method** might help verify if I'm on the right track. The **Graphical Approach** could provide insight but isn't precise, and the **Analytical Bounds** might simplify calculations.\n\nLet me start with the **Direct Calculation Method** and see where it leads. If it gets messy, I'll switch to approximations or bounds.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Setting Up the Equation**\n\nGiven \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} = 0 \\), I know that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi\n\\]\n\nfor integer values of \\( n \\).\n\n**Reflection:** This makes sense because the sine function is zero at multiples of \\( \\pi \\).\n\n**Check:** Is this the correct condition for \\( x \\)-intercepts? Yes, since \\( \\sin \\theta = 0 \\) at \\( \\theta = n\\pi \\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Solving for \\( x \\)**\n\nFrom \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\), I can solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{n\\pi}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, so to find the \\( x \\)-intercepts, I need to determine which integer \\( n \\) values make \\( x \\) fall within \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\).\n\n**Check:** Does this cover all possible \\( n \\)? As \\( n \\) increases, \\( x \\) decreases, so I should get multiple \\( n \\) values within this range.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Range of \\( n \\)**\n\nI need to find \\( n \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n0.0001 < \\frac{1}{n\\pi} < 0.001\n\\]\n\nLet's flip the inequalities to make it easier:\n\n\\[\n10000 > n\\pi > 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, divide by \\( \\pi \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10000}{\\pi} > n > \\frac{1000}{\\pi}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This looks more manageable. I just need to calculate \\( \\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\) and \\( \\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\) to find the range for \\( n \\).\n\n**Check:** Is \\( n \\) supposed to be an integer? Yes, so I\u2019ll round these values accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Calculating Numerical Values**\n\nUsing \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14159 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10000}{\\pi} \\approx \\frac{10000}{3.14159} \\approx 3183.098861837907\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1000}{\\pi} \\approx \\frac{1000}{3.14159} \\approx 318.3098861837907\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, \\( n \\) should be between approximately 318.31 and 3183.10.\n\n**Check:** Are these values reasonable? Yes, since \\( n \\) needs to be an integer, we can take \\( n \\) from 319 to 3183.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Counting the Integer Values**\n\nNow, let's count the integers \\( n \\) from 319 to 3183 inclusive.\n\n\\[\n3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** That's a large number of intercepts\u20142865 in total.\n\n**Check:** Does this seem too high? Initially, it does, but given the narrow interval and how quickly \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) oscillates, it might be correct.\n\n**Insight:** The \\( x \\)-intercepts are densely packed within this narrow range because \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) increases rapidly as \\( x \\) decreases.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Verifying the Calculation**\n\nLet me double-check this result.\n\n- The range for \\( n \\) is \\( 319 \\leq n \\leq 3183 \\).\n- Total \\( n \\) values: \\( 3183 - 319 + 1 = 2865 \\).\n\n**Reflection:** This calculation seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I'm not miscounting.\n\n**Check:** Quick sanity check\u2014does adding 1 to the difference account for both endpoints? Yes, so the count is correct.\n\n**Insight:** The method aligns with the expected behavior of \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\). As \\( x \\) gets smaller, \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) cycles through many multiples of \\( \\pi \\), leading to numerous \\( x \\)-intercepts.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Considering Alternative Approaches**\n\nWait, let's consider if there's a more intuitive way to verify this result.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:** Use the small-angle approximation for sine: \\( \\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta \\) when \\( \\theta \\) is close to zero.\n\n- Given \\( \\frac{1}{x} = n\\pi \\), for large \\( n \\), \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\approx \\frac{1}{x} \\).\n\n- This implies \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\approx n\\pi \\), which aligns with our earlier calculation.\n\n**Reflection:** This approximation supports the correctness of the original calculation.\n\n**Check:** Does this approximation match the integer \\( n \\) values? Yes, it does.\n\n**Insight:** Using approximations can validate the precision of the original method, ensuring that the large count of intercepts is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Final Step: Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully calculating and verifying, the number of \\( x \\)-intercepts on the graph of \\( y = \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) in the interval \\( (0.0001, 0.001) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2865}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** While 2865 might seem high at first, the rapid oscillation of \\( \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\) explains the dense packing of intercepts in such a narrow interval.\n\n**Check:** Final review confirms that the approach is correct, and the calculations align with the expected behavior of the function.\n\n**Insight:** Taking multiple approaches\u2014direct calculation, approximation, and graphical intuition\u2014ensures the solution's reliability, highlighting the importance of checking and reflecting throughout the problem-solving process.",
