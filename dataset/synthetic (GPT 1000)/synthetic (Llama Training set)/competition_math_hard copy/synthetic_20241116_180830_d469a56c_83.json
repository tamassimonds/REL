I'll mimic human thought processes, including exploring different strategies, checking work, and adjusting approaches if something doesn't seem right. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, the problem asks us to write \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25} + \\frac{9}{4}} \\) as a common fraction. \n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Familiar Structure:** This reminds me of adding fractions under a square root\u2014something similar to the Pythagorean theorem.\n  \n- **Adding Fractions:** I know that I need to find a common denominator to add \\( \\frac{16}{25} \\) and \\( \\frac{9}{4} \\).\n\n- **Square Root:** After adding, taking the square root suggests simplifying the result, possibly factoring or knowing perfect squares.\n\n**Wait, Let\u2019s Explore Different Strategies:**\n\n1. **Common Denominator Approach:** \n   - Find a common denominator for \\( \\frac{16}{25} \\) and \\( \\frac{9}{4} \\), add the fractions, and then take the square root.\n   \n2. **Simplifying Fractions First:** \n   - Simplify each fraction before finding a common denominator to make the addition easier.\n   \n3. **Decimal Conversion:** \n   - Convert fractions to decimals, add them, and then take the square root as a last resort.\n\n4. **Factoring Under the Square Root:** \n   - See if the expression under the square root can be factored to simplify the square root directly without adding the fractions first.\n\n**Hmm, which one to start with?**\n\nI think starting with the **Common Denominator Approach** makes sense because it's straightforward. If it gets too messy, I can consider simplifying first or factoring. Let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Find a Common Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I need to add \\( \\frac{16}{25} \\) and \\( \\frac{9}{4} \\). To do this, I must find a common denominator.\n  \n- The denominators are 25 and 4. Let\u2019s think about the least common multiple (LCM).\n\n**Wait, let's recall how to find the LCM:**\n\n- **Multiples of 25:** 25, 50, 75, 100, ...\n- **Multiples of 4:** 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, ...\n\n**Hmm, the smallest common multiple is 100.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is 100 the smallest?** Yes, 100 is the least common multiple of 25 and 4.\n  \n- **Can I proceed with this?** Yes, let's use 100 as the common denominator.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{25} = \\frac{16 \\times 4}{25 \\times 4} = \\frac{64}{100}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{9 \\times 25}{4 \\times 25} = \\frac{225}{100}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Multiplications seem correct:** \\( 16 \\times 4 = 64 \\) and \\( 9 \\times 25 = 225 \\).\n  \n- **Denominators match:** Both fractions are now over 100.\n\n**Okay, that looks good.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Add the Fractions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that both fractions have a common denominator, I can add the numerators.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{64}{100} + \\frac{225}{100} = \\frac{64 + 225}{100} = \\frac{289}{100}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Addition seems correct:** \\( 64 + 225 = 289 \\).\n  \n- **Is \\(\\frac{289}{100}\\) in simplest form?** Let's see if 289 and 100 have a common factor.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Factors of 289:** \\( 289 = 17 \\times 17 \\) (289 is a perfect square).\n  \n- **Factors of 100:** \\( 100 = 10 \\times 10 = 2^2 \\times 5^2 \\).\n\n**Hmm, no common factors other than 1.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **\\(\\frac{289}{100}\\) is in simplest form.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplify the Square Root**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The original problem asks for the square root of the sum. So, I need to find \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{289}{100}} \\).\n  \n- This reminds me that the square root of a fraction can be split into the square roots of the numerator and denominator separately.\n\n**Wait, let me confirm this approach:**\n\n- **Property of Square Roots:** \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}} \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{289}{100}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{289}}{\\sqrt{100}} = \\frac{17}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **\\(\\sqrt{289} = 17\\):** Yes, because \\( 17 \\times 17 = 289 \\).\n  \n- **\\(\\sqrt{100} = 10\\):** Yes, because \\( 10 \\times 10 = 100 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does \\(\\frac{17}{10}\\) make sense?** Yes, it\u2019s a common fraction, and the square root operation was correctly applied.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Final Answer:** \\( \\frac{17}{10} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- It\u2019s always good to double-check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does \\( \\frac{17}{10} \\) satisfy the original equation?**\n  \n  - Let's see if squaring \\( \\frac{17}{10} \\) gives back the sum inside the square root.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{17}{10} \\right)^2 = \\frac{289}{100}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does \\(\\frac{289}{100}\\) match our earlier result?** Yes, \\( \\frac{289}{100} \\) was the sum of \\( \\frac{16}{25} \\) and \\( \\frac{9}{4} \\) after finding a common denominator and adding.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **The answer checks out.** \\( \\frac{17}{10} \\) is indeed correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Factoring Under the Square Root**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Earlier, I started with finding a common denominator, but I remember another method where I can try to simplify the expression under the square root before adding.\n\n- **Factor the Square Root:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25} + \\frac{9}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16 \\times 4 + 9 \\times 25}{25 \\times 4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{64 + 225}{100}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{289}{100}} = \\frac{17}{10}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Same result:** This alternative approach also leads to \\( \\frac{17}{10} \\).\n\n- **Does it simplify the process?** Not much in this case, but it's good to know that factoring works as well.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Both methods yield the same correct answer.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:** Starting with finding a common denominator was effective here. Alternative methods like simplifying before adding or factoring under the square root also work, but may not necessarily simplify the process significantly.\n\n- **Checking Work:** Regularly verifying each step ensured that the solution was correct and aligned with the original problem.\n\n- **Reflection and Adjustment:** Initially exploring different strategies and being open to switching approaches helped confirm the correctness of the final answer.\n\n- **Natural Flow:** Writing out thoughts, checking if something feels right, and confirming through calculations mimicked a human problem-solving approach.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25} + \\frac{9}{4}} = \\frac{17}{10}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough, reflecting a human-like thought process, helps in understanding how to tackle the problem step by step!",
