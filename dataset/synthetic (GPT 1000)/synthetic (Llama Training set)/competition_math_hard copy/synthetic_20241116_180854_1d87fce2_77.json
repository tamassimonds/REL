    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a human thought process. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their validity, and adjust my approach as needed. Along the way, I'll check my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, I see it involves converting numbers between different bases\u2014specifically, base 8 (octal) and base 2 (binary). Here's what comes to mind:\n\n- **Conversion Between Bases:** I've done base conversion before. It's about understanding how to represent numbers in different numeral systems.\n- **Number of Digits in Each Base:** The fact that the number has 4 digits in base 8 and \\( d \\) digits in base 2 is crucial. It hints at the relationship between the two bases and the value of the number.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. I remember that each base has a specific range of values represented by its digits, and that might be key here. Maybe I need to find the range of numbers that have 4 digits in base 8 and then see how those translate into base 2.\n\n---\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Determine the Range of 4-Digit Numbers in Base 8:**\n   - This would give me the possible integer values we're dealing with.\n\n2. **Convert These Numbers to Base 10:**\n   - Since it's easier to work with base 10, maybe converting base 8 numbers to base 10 could help.\n\n3. **Convert Base 10 to Base 2:**\n   - Finally, converting the base 10 numbers to base 2 would give me the number of digits \\( d \\) in base 2.\n\n4. **Analyze the Possible Values of \\( d \\):**\n   - Once I have the ranges in base 2, I can determine all possible values of \\( d \\).\n\nWait, let me think... This seems like a solid plan. But, to be sure, I might also consider looking for patterns or mathematical properties that relate the two bases more directly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Range of 4-Digit Numbers in Base 8**\n\nOkay, let's think about what it means to have 4 digits in base 8:\n\n- The smallest 4-digit number in base 8 is \\( 1000_8 \\).\n- The largest 4-digit number in base 8 is \\( 7777_8 \\).\n\nHmm, I need to convert these to base 10 to get a clearer picture.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Smallest 4-digit number in base 8:**\n  \\[\n  1000_8 = 1 \\times 8^3 + 0 \\times 8^2 + 0 \\times 8^1 + 0 \\times 8^0 = 512_{10}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Largest 4-digit number in base 8:**\n  \\[\n  7777_8 = 7 \\times 8^3 + 7 \\times 8^2 + 7 \\times 8^1 + 7 \\times 8^0 = 3583_{10}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, the integer we're dealing with is between 512 and 3583 in base 10. I think this makes sense because any number within this range would have 4 digits in base 8.\n\nHmm, wait a minute\u2014let me double-check the conversion from base 8 to base 10. It looks correct, but it's always good to verify.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Convert Base 10 Numbers to Base 2 to Find \\( d \\)**\n\nNow that I have the range in base 10, I need to determine how many digits \\( d \\) the number would have in base 2.\n\nHere's my thinking:\n\n- A number \\( N \\) in base 10 has \\( d \\) digits in base 2 if \\( 2^{d-1} \\leq N < 2^d \\).\n- So, I need to find \\( d \\) such that this inequality holds for \\( N \\) between 512 and 3583.\n\nBut let me consider a different approach too\u2014perhaps calculating the base 2 representations of the lower and upper bounds directly.\n\nHmm, both methods seem viable. I'll start with the inequality approach because it feels more straightforward.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nFor the smallest 4-digit base 8 number:\n\\[\n512 = 2^9\n\\]\nSo, it has 10 digits in base 2 because:\n\\[\n2^{10-1} = 2^9 = 512 \\quad (\\text{lower bound})\n\\]\n\nFor the largest 4-digit base 8 number:\n\\[\n3583 = 2^{11} - 1 = 2048 + 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1\n\\]\nSo, \\( 3583 \\) is less than \\( 2^{12} = 4096 \\), but more than \\( 2^{11} = 2048 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( d \\) could be 11 or 12 because:\n\\[\n2^{11} \\leq 3583 < 2^{12}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so \\( d \\) could be 11 or 12. This makes sense because the range between 512 and 3583 spans both 11-digit and 12-digit binary numbers.\n\nHmm, let me verify by checking if 512 and 3583 fall within the expected binary digit ranges.\n\n- \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\) and \\( 2^{11} = 2048 \\)\n- \\( 512 < 1024 \\) (less than 11 digits)\n- \\( 3583 \\geq 2048 \\) and \\( 3583 < 4096 \\) (11 digits)\n\nWait, according to this, 512 should actually be 10 digits in base 2. But earlier, I calculated it as needing 11. Let me recheck.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Re-evaluating the Binary Digit Calculation**\n\nLet me take a step back and re-examine my approach. It's possible I misinterpreted the relationship between the number of digits in base 2 and base 8.\n\nHere's what I remember:\n\n- A number \\( N \\) has \\( d \\) digits in base 2 if \\( 2^{d-1} \\leq N < 2^d \\).\n- When converting from base 8 to base 2, each base 8 digit represents 3 binary digits because \\( 8 = 2^3 \\).\n\nHmm, this suggests that the number of binary digits \\( d \\) is approximately three times the number of base 8 digits. Since the number has 4 digits in base 8, \\( d \\) should be around \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\).\n\nBut earlier, I also considered \\( d = 11 \\). Wait, let me explore why both 11 and 12 could be valid.\n\n**Recalculations:**\n\nGiven the range in base 10 (512 to 3583):\n\n- \\( 512_{10} = 2^9 \\)\n- \\( 3583_{10} < 2^{12} \\)\n\nSo, \\( 512 \\) has 10 binary digits, but since it's the lower bound, we're actually considering numbers starting from \\( 2^9 \\) onwards.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of \\( d \\) are 11 and 12, corresponding to the upper bound \\( 3583 \\) lying between \\( 2^{11} \\) and \\( 2^{12} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis aligns with the earlier conclusion. The lower bound \\( 512 \\) doesn't affect the upper bound's \\( d \\) because we're looking for the highest potential \\( d \\) within the given range.\n\nHmm, I think this makes sense now. It's like setting a tier system where the lower bound already ensures at least 10 digits, but to capture all possible values up to 3583, \\( d \\) can extend to 12.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Verifying the Approach with an Example**\n\nLet me test this with specific examples to ensure the reasoning holds.\n\n**Example 1: \\( N = 512 \\)**\n- \\( 512_{10} = 2^9 \\)\n- Binary representation: \\( 1000000000_2 \\) (10 digits)\n\nWait, the question specifies \\( d \\) digits. So, since \\( 512 \\) is exactly \\( 2^9 \\), it fits the lower boundary, providing a 10-digit binary representation.\n\nBut I need to consider numbers just above \\( 512 \\) to see how \\( d \\) changes.\n\n**Example 2: \\( N = 1024 \\)**\n- \\( 1024_{10} = 2^{10} \\)\n- Binary representation: \\( 10000000000_2 \\) (11 digits)\n\nThis indicates that \\( N \\) transitions from 10 to 11 digits at \\( 2^{10} \\).\n\n**Example 3: \\( N = 2048 \\)**\n- \\( 2048_{10} = 2^{11} \\)\n- Binary representation: \\( 100000000000_2 \\) (12 digits)\n\nThis shows that \\( N \\) can extend to 12 digits at \\( 3583 \\) since \\( 3583 \\) is just below \\( 2^{12} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe examples confirm that the number of binary digits \\( d \\) can indeed be 11 or 12 within the given range.\n\nAh, I see now that the lower bound \\( 512 \\) ensures at least 10 digits, but since we're considering numbers up to \\( 3583 \\), \\( d \\) can increase to 12. This clarifies why both 11 and 12 are valid.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Finalizing the Possible Values of \\( d \\)**\n\nBased on the reflection and examples, the possible values of \\( d \\) are 11 and 12.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there are any other possible values:\n\n- The lower bound \\( 512 \\) already requires at least 10 digits in base 2.\n- The upper bound \\( 3583 \\) can extend up to 12 digits.\n\nTherefore, the only possible values for \\( d \\) are indeed 11 and 12.\n\nReflecting on this, I think the approach is correct. By considering the range in base 10 and the relationship between bases, we've accounted for all possible binary digit scenarios.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Calculating the Sum of All Possible Values of \\( d \\)**\n\nNow that I've determined that the possible values of \\( d \\) are 11 and 12, the sum is:\n\n\\[\nd_{\\text{sum}} = 11 + 12 = 23\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems straightforward, but let me verify that 11 and 12 are indeed the only possibilities.\n\nGiven the earlier steps, the range in base 10 supports both 11-digit and 12-digit binary representations. There's no other base 2 digit length that fits within the constraints.\n\nI think the sum of 23 is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Final Check**\n\nLet's quickly recap the entire thought process:\n\n1. **Determined the Range in Base 10:** Converted the 4-digit base 8 numbers to base 10 (512 to 3583).\n2. **Analyzed the Binary Digit Requirements:** Used the relationship between bases to find possible values of \\( d \\).\n3. **Verified with Examples:** Checked specific numbers to ensure the digit lengths align with expectations.\n4. **Confirmed the Sum:** Added all possible \\( d \\) values to arrive at the final answer.\n\nThroughout, I reflected on each step, checked for consistency, and adjusted the approach when needed. This ensures the solution is both accurate and comprehensible.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter thoroughly exploring different strategies, verifying with examples, and ensuring consistency across steps, the sum of all possible values of \\( d \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{23}\n\\]\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's dive back into the problem and re-examine my approach to ensure we arrive at the correct answer. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their validity, and integrate successful methods to correct the mistake.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies Again**\n\nWhen I first tackled this problem, I focused on determining the range of a certain integer \\( N \\) based on its representation in base 8 and then converting that range to base 2 to find possible values for \\( d \\). However, upon reviewing a sample solution, it seems I overlooked some nuances.\n\nLet me brainstorm again:\n\n1. **Range of 4-Digit Numbers in Base 8:**\n   - Reconfirm the smallest and largest 4-digit numbers in base 8 and their base 10 equivalents.\n\n2. **Conversion Between Bases:**\n   - Ensure accurate conversion from base 10 to base 2 to determine \\( d \\).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Highest Place Value in Base 2:**\n   - Instead of just considering the range, think about how the highest place value in base 2 relates to the base 8 representation.\n\n4. **Considering All Possible Base 2 Digit Lengths:**\n   - Verify whether the base 2 representation can have 10, 11, or 12 digits, as suggested by the sample solution.\n\nHmm, it seems I might have initially narrowed down the possible values of \\( d \\) to 11 and 12, but the sample solution indicates that \\( d \\) could also be 10. Let's explore why this is the case.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Re-examining the Range of 4-Digit Numbers in Base 8**\n\nAs before, the smallest and largest 4-digit numbers in base 8 are:\n\n- **Smallest:** \\( 1000_8 = 1 \\times 8^3 = 512_{10} \\)\n- **Largest:** \\( 7777_8 = 7 \\times 8^3 + 7 \\times 8^2 + 7 \\times 8^1 + 7 \\times 8^0 = 3583_{10} \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis range makes sense. However, earlier, I didn't fully consider how the base 2 representation could extend down to 10 digits. Let's explore this further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring the Highest Place Value in Base 2**\n\nThe sample solution suggests that when \\( N \\) has 4 digits in base 8, its highest place value in base 2 could be \\( 2^9 \\), \\( 2^{10} \\), or \\( 2^{11} \\). Let's break this down:\n\n- **\\( 2^9 = 512 \\):** The smallest 4-digit base 8 number.\n- **\\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\):** The next power of 2 after 512.\n- **\\( 2^{11} = 2048 \\):** The subsequent power of 2.\n\nThis implies that \\( N \\) could fall within ranges that require 10, 11, or 12 binary digits, depending on its exact value.\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait a moment\u2014does this mean I need to consider all possible values of \\( d \\) from 10 to 12? The sample solution suggests that \\( d \\) can indeed be 10, 11, or 12. Let me verify this by examining specific examples.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Validating with Examples**\n\n**Example 1: \\( N = 512 \\)**\n- \\( 512_{10} = 2^9 \\)\n- Binary representation: \\( 1000000000_2 \\) (10 digits)\n\n**Example 2: \\( N = 1023 \\)**\n- \\( 1023_{10} = 2^{10} - 1 = 2048 - 1 = 1023 \\)\n- Binary representation: \\( 1111111111_2 \\) (10 digits)\n\n**Example 3: \\( N = 2048 \\)**\n- \\( 2048_{10} = 2^{11} \\)\n- Binary representation: \\( 100000000000_2 \\) (12 digits)\n\n**Example 4: \\( N = 3583 \\)**\n- \\( 3583_{10} = 2^{11} - 1 = 2048 + 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 \\)\n- Binary representation: \\( 111111111111_2 \\) (12 digits)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThese examples show that \\( N \\) can have as few as 10 digits in base 2, up to 12 digits. This aligns with the sample solution, indicating that I need to include \\( d = 10 \\) in my possible values.\n\nAhh, I see\u2014by initially only considering \\( d = 11 \\) and \\( d = 12 \\), I neglected the possibility of \\( d = 10 \\). This was an oversight on my part.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Adjusting the Approach**\n\nTo ensure all possible \\( d \\) values are accounted for, I'll re-evaluate the relationship between base 8 and base 2:\n\n- Each base 8 digit represents 3 binary digits because \\( 8 = 2^3 \\).\n- Therefore, a number with 4 digits in base 8 can have up to \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\) binary digits.\n\nHowever, considering the specific powers of 2 that \\( N \\) could be, \\( d \\) can also be as low as 10 when \\( N \\) is exactly \\( 2^9 \\) or slightly above.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finalizing the Possible Values of \\( d \\)**\n\nBased on the corrected approach, the possible values of \\( d \\) are:\n\n- \\( d = 10 \\): When \\( N \\) is at least \\( 512 \\) but less than \\( 1024 \\) (\\( 2^{10} \\)).\n- \\( d = 11 \\): When \\( N \\) is at least \\( 1024 \\) but less than \\( 2048 \\) (\\( 2^{11} \\)).\n- \\( d = 12 \\): When \\( N \\) is at least \\( 2048 \\) but less than or equal to \\( 3583 \\) (\\( 2^{12} - 1 \\)).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense. By considering the ranges defined by powers of 2, we've accounted for all possible binary digit lengths \\( d \\).\n\nI realize that my earlier solution missed \\( d = 10 \\), which is essential for capturing the full spectrum of \\( N \\) values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating the Sum of All Possible Values of \\( d \\)**\n\nNow that I've identified the possible values of \\( d \\) as 10, 11, and 12, the sum is:\n\n\\[\nd_{\\text{sum}} = 10 + 11 + 12 = 33\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis aligns with the sample solution. By including \\( d = 10 \\), we're accurately representing all possible binary digit lengths for \\( N \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nLet's quickly recap the entire thought process:\n\n1. **Determined the Range in Base 10:** Converted the 4-digit base 8 numbers to base 10 (512 to 3583).\n2. **Analyzed the Binary Digit Requirements:** Re-examined the relationship between bases to find possible \\( d \\) values.\n3. **Verified with Examples:** Checked specific numbers to ensure the digit lengths align with expectations.\n4. **Corrected the Oversight:** Integrated \\( d = 10 \\) based on power of 2 considerations.\n5. **Confirmed the Sum:** Added all possible \\( d \\) values to arrive at the final answer.\n\nThroughout, I reflected on each step, checked for consistency, and adjusted the approach when needed. This ensures the solution is both accurate and comprehensible.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter thoroughly re-exploring different strategies, verifying with examples, and incorporating the missing \\( d = 10 \\) value, the sum of all possible values of \\( d \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{33}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nI hope this revised solution makes the thought process clear. By continuously reflecting and adjusting my approach, I've ensured the correctness of the final answer.",

The largest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $7777_8$, which is $1$ less than $10000_8$ and therefore stands for $8^4-1 = 2^{12}-1$.\n\nThus, when a $4$-digit base-$8$ integer is written in base $2$, its highest place value is either $2^9$, $2^{10}$, or $2^{11}$.
