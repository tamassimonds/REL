Here\u2019s how I\u2019d naturally approach it:\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, the question is: For what values of \\( x \\) is \\( x^2 - 2x > 35 \\)? And I need to express the answer in interval notation.\n\nInitially, I'm thinking this inequality resembles quadratic equations I've dealt with before. Quadratics often involve finding roots or determining where the function is above or below a certain value. Maybe I can set it up like a standard quadratic inequality and solve it step by step.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Standard Quadratic Inequality Approach:**  \n   - Move all terms to one side to set the inequality to zero.\n   - Factor the quadratic (if possible) or use the quadratic formula to find the roots.\n   - Determine the intervals where the inequality holds true using test points.\n\n2. **Graphical Method:**  \n   - Sketch the quadratic function and visually identify where it lies above 35.\n   - This might give a quick insight into the solution intervals.\n\n3. **Complete the Square:**  \n   - Rewrite the quadratic expression by completing the square to find the vertex form.\n   - This could help identify the minimum or maximum point of the parabola.\n\n4. **Alternative Methods:**  \n   - Consider using the idea of vertex and axis of symmetry.\n   - Maybe leverage properties of parabolas, like knowing they open upwards or downwards.\n\n**Reflecting on the Strategies:**\n\nHmm, the **Standard Quadratic Inequality Approach** seems the most straightforward\u2014moving all terms to one side is a typical first step. But I also like the **Graphical Method** for a visual check. Completing the square might take more time, and while it's useful for finding the vertex, it might not be necessary here.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the **Standard Quadratic Inequality Approach** and see where it leads. If I run into difficulties, I\u2019ll consider switching to another method.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Set Up the Inequality**\n\nI\u2019ll start by moving all terms to one side of the inequality to set it to zero:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 2x - 35 > 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThis looks more like a standard quadratic inequality now. I need to find the values of \\( x \\) where this expression is greater than zero.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Factor the Quadratic Expression**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll try to factor \\( x^2 - 2x - 35 \\). Factoring quadratics is always a good first step if it\u2019s manageable.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-35\\) (the constant term) and add up to \\(-2\\) (the coefficient of \\( x \\)).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- Numbers that multiply to \\(-35\\): Possible pairs are \\((1, -35), (-1, 35), (5, -7), (-5, 7)\\).\n- Of these, \\(5\\) and \\(-7\\) add up to \\(-2\\): \\(5 + (-7) = -2\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times (-7) = -35 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 5 + (-7) = -2\n\\]\n\nThat looks correct.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nSo, I can factor the quadratic as:\n\n\\[\n(x - 7)(x + 5) > 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nMultiplying back:\n\n\\[\n(x - 7)(x + 5) = x^2 + 5x - 7x - 35 = x^2 - 2x - 35\n\\]\n\nYep, that matches the original expression. Factoring seems to be working.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Critical Points**\n\nThe next step is to find the critical points\u2014these are the values of \\( x \\) where the product \\((x - 7)(x + 5) = 0\\). \n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSetting each factor to zero will give me the points where the expression changes its sign.\n\n\\[\nx - 7 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 7\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 5 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -5\n\\]\n\nSo, the critical points are \\( x = -5 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThese points divide the number line into intervals. I need to test each interval to see where the inequality holds true.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Test the Intervals**\n\nNow, I'll pick a test point from each interval to determine whether the inequality \\( (x - 7)(x + 5) > 0 \\) is satisfied.\n\n**Intervals to Test:**\n\n1. \\( (-\\infty, -5) \\)\n2. \\( (-5, 7) \\)\n3. \\( (7, \\infty) \\)\n\n**Testing the First Interval: \\( (-\\infty, -5) \\)**\n\nPick a test point, say \\( x = -6 \\):\n\n\\[\n(-6 - 7)(-6 + 5) = (-13)(-1) = 13 > 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo in the interval \\( (-\\infty, -5) \\), the expression is positive.\n\n**Testing the Second Interval: \\( (-5, 7) \\)**\n\nPick a test point, say \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n(0 - 7)(0 + 5) = (-7)(5) = -35 < 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIn the interval \\( (-5, 7) \\), the expression is negative.\n\n**Testing the Third Interval: \\( (7, \\infty) \\)**\n\nPick a test point, say \\( x = 8 \\):\n\n\\[\n(8 - 7)(8 + 5) = (1)(13) = 13 > 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIn the interval \\( (7, \\infty) \\), the expression is positive.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- \\( (-\\infty, -5) \\): Positive\n- \\( (-5, 7) \\): Negative\n- \\( (7, \\infty) \\): Positive\n\nThis makes sense. The quadratic opens upwards (since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive), so it will be positive outside the roots and negative between them.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Write the Solution in Interval Notation**\n\nThe inequality \\( x^2 - 2x > 35 \\) is satisfied where \\( (x - 7)(x + 5) > 0 \\). From the tests, this occurs in the intervals:\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -5) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (7, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat aligns with my expectations. The quadratic is positive outside the roots.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nx \\in (-\\infty, -5) \\cup (7, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does this make sense? Yes, since the quadratic opens upwards, the expression should be greater than zero outside the critical points.\n- Is there any overlap or missing intervals? No, only \\( (-\\infty, -5) \\) and \\( (7, \\infty) \\) are where the expression is positive.\n\n---\n\n**Alternative Approach: Graphical Method**\n\nJust for completeness, let's consider the graphical method to verify.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf I were to plot the quadratic function \\( y = x^2 - 2x \\), the horizontal line \\( y = 35 \\) would intersect the parabola at the points \\( x = -5 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\). The regions where the parabola is above this line correspond to the solution intervals.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis visual confirmation supports my earlier algebraic solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth methods agree\u2014\\( x \\in (-\\infty, -5) \\cup (7, \\infty) \\)\u2014so I'm confident in the answer.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy starting with brainstorming and exploring different strategies, I was able to methodically approach the problem. Reflecting often helped catch and confirm each step's correctness. Testing intervals ensured that the solution was accurate, and considering alternative methods provided a verification layer. Through this step-by-step process, the solution was reached confidently and correctly.\n\n**Final Interval Notation:**  \n\\[\nx \\in (-\\infty, -5) \\cup (7, \\infty)\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "After moving the constant over, we get a quadratic expression and solve for the roots: \\begin{align*}\nx^2-2x-35&>0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(x-7)(x+5)&>0.\n\\end{align*} The quadratic expression equals 0 at $x=7$ and $x=-5$, meaning it changes sign at each root. Now we look at the sign of the quadratic when $x<-5$, when $-5<x<7$, and when $x>7$. When $x<-5$, $(x-7)$ and $(x+5)$ are both negative, so the product is positive. When $-5<x<7$, $(x+5)$ becomes positive, while $(x-7)$ remains negative - the product is negative. When $x>7$, both factors are positive, so the product is positive. So, $(x-7)(x+5)>0$ when $x<-5$ or $x>7$, which means our answer in interval notation is $\\boxed{(-\\infty, -5) \\cup (7, \\infty)}$.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, so a graph of $(x-7)(x+5)=0$ would open up. When there are two distinct roots, the shape of the parabola means that product is negative when $x$ is between the roots and positive when $x$ is less than both roots or greater than both roots."
