    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s tackle this problem step by step, mimicking a human thought process with brainstorming, reflections, and checking along the way.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the expression:\n\n\\[\n((5p + 1) - 2p \\cdot 4)(3) + (4 - 1 \\div 3)(6p - 9)\n\\]\n\nmy immediate reaction is, \u201cThis looks like a mix of algebraic expressions and basic arithmetic operations. It reminds me of simplifying expressions by distributing and combining like terms. I'm also reminded of the order of operations\u2014PEMDAS\u2014which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\u201d\n\n#### **Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Distribute and Combine Terms:** My first thought is to distribute the terms within the parentheses and then combine like terms.\n   \n2. **Check for Factoring Opportunities:** Maybe there\u2019s a way to factor parts of the expression to simplify it earlier.\n\n3. **Simplify Each Component Separately:** Focus on simplifying each part of the expression step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\n4. **Look for Common Patterns:** Perhaps recognizing patterns like the distributive property or the difference of squares could help.\n\nI think starting with distribution makes sense since it\u2019s a straightforward approach.\n\n### **Step 1: Distributing Terms in the First Part**\n\nLet\u2019s focus on the first part of the expression:\n\n\\[\n((5p + 1) - 2p \\cdot 4)(3)\n\\]\n\n#### **Applying Distribution:**\n\n- **Inside the Parentheses:** First, simplify \\(2p \\cdot 4\\).\n  \n  \\[\n  2p \\cdot 4 = 8p\n  \\]\n  \n- **Subtracting from \\(5p + 1\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  (5p + 1) - 8p = (5p - 8p) + 1 = -3p + 1\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:** Okay, that looks correct. Subtracting \\(8p\\) from \\(5p\\) gives \\(-3p\\), and the constant remains \\(1\\).\n\n#### **Next Step: Multiplying by 3:**\n\n\\[\n(-3p + 1) \\cdot 3 = -9p + 3\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Does \\(-9p + 3\\) make sense? Yes, multiplying both terms by \\(3\\) is straightforward.\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Second Part**\n\nNow, let\u2019s tackle the second part of the expression:\n\n\\[\n(4 - 1 \\div 3)(6p - 9)\n\\]\n\n#### **First Thoughts: Handling Division**\n\nI notice there\u2019s a division inside the parentheses. According to the order of operations, I need to simplify that first.\n\n#### **Simplifying \\(1 \\div 3\\):**\n\n\\[\n1 \\div 3 = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Instead of leaving it as a decimal, keeping it as a fraction might make further calculations cleaner.\n\n#### **Updating the Expression:**\n\n\\[\n(4 - \\frac{1}{3})(6p - 9)\n\\]\n\n#### **Simplifying \\(4 - \\frac{1}{3}\\):**\n\nTo subtract \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) from \\(4\\), convert \\(4\\) into a fraction:\n\n\\[\n4 = \\frac{12}{3} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{12}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{11}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Subtracting fractions works, and \\(\\frac{11}{3}\\) is correct.\n\n#### **Preparing to Distribute:**\n\nNow, our expression looks like:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{11}{3}\\right)(6p - 9)\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Time to distribute \\(\\frac{11}{3}\\) across both terms in the parentheses.\n\n### **Step 3: Distributing \\(\\frac{11}{3}\\) to \\(6p - 9\\)**\n\nLet\u2019s do this step by step:\n\n#### **Distributing to \\(6p\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{3} \\times 6p = \\frac{66p}{3} = 22p\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Dividing \\(66p\\) by \\(3\\) simplifies nicely to \\(22p\\).\n\n#### **Distributing to \\(-9\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{3} \\times (-9) = -\\frac{99}{3} = -33\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Multiplying by \\(-9\\) and then simplifying by \\(3\\) gives \\(-33\\). That seems correct.\n\n#### **Updating the Expression:**\n\nSo, the second part simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n22p - 33\n\\]\n\n### **Step 4: Combining Both Parts of the Expression**\n\nNow, let\u2019s add the two simplified parts together:\n\n\\[\n(-9p + 3) + (22p - 33)\n\\]\n\n#### **Combining Like Terms:**\n\n- **For \\(p\\) Terms:** \\(-9p + 22p = (22 - 9)p = 13p\\)\n  \n- **For Constant Terms:** \\(3 - 33 = -30\\)\n  \nSo, the combined expression is:\n\n\\[\n13p - 30\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This makes sense. Combining the \\(p\\) terms and the constants separately leads to a neat result.\n\n### **Step 5: Checking the Simplified Expression**\n\n**Quick Check:** Is \\(13p - 30\\) a correct simplification?\n\n- **Does it match the original problem's form \\(ap - b\\)?** Yes, where \\(a = 13\\) and \\(b = 30\\).\n  \n- **Are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) positive integers?** Yes, both coefficients are positive integers.\n\n**Thoughts:** Everything checks out. The steps logically lead to this simplified expression, and it fits the required form.\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Did I explore different strategies?** Yes, I considered distribution, factoring, and simplifying each component separately.\n\n- **Were there any misconceptions?** Initially, I didn't account for simplifying \\(1 \\div 3\\) right away, but recognizing the order of operations helped correct that.\n\n- **Is the final answer correct?** After distributing and combining like terms carefully, the answer is indeed \\(13p - 30\\).\n\n- **Did I check along the way?** Yes, multiple quick checks ensured each step was correct before proceeding, preventing errors from carrying forward.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe simplified expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{13p - 30}\n\\]\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically\u2014beginning with brainstorming, thoroughly exploring strategies, reflecting and checking each step\u2014I ensured the final answer is both correct and aligned with the required form. This step-by-step exploration mimics a human problem-solving process, complete with initial uncertainties, corrections, and confirmations.",
