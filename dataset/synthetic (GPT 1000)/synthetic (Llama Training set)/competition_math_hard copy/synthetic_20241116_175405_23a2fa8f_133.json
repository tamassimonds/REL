    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it as naturally as possible, starting with brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, checking my work often, and adjusting my approach as needed. It's important to think out loud, explore different paths, and be open to changing direction if something doesn't seem right.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I notice a few key elements:\n\n1. **Function Composition:** The equation involves \\( f(x + y) \\) expressed in terms of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f(y) \\). This reminds me of functional equations that often involve linearity or exponential functions.\n   \n2. **Base Conditions:** We're given \\( f(1) = 1 \\). Having a specific value can help determine the function later.\n\n3. **Real Numbers:** The equation holds for all real numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), which suggests that the function might have to satisfy properties across the entire real line.\n\nInitially, I think this might involve assuming a specific form for \\( f(x) \\), maybe linear or exponential, and then verifying if it fits. Alternatively, I could explore checking simple values to gather more information about the function's behavior.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Assume a Linear Function:** Maybe \\( f(x) = ax + b \\). Plugging this into the equation could help me see if it fits.\n\n2. **Check Simple Values:** Start by plugging in \\( x = 1 \\) or \\( y = 1 \\) to see how the function behaves.\n\n3. **Look for Exponential Patterns:** Since there's \\( 3^y \\) and \\( 2^x \\) involved, perhaps \\( f(x) \\) is related to exponentials.\n\n4. **Functional Properties:** Explore if the function is even, odd, or has other symmetries.\n\nI think starting with checking simple values might give me some initial insights. If that doesn't lead anywhere, I can try assuming a form for \\( f(x) \\).\n\n### **Step 1: Checking Simple Values**\n\nLet's set \\( y = 1 \\) in the functional equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x + 1) = 3^1 f(x) + 2^x f(1)\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( f(1) = 1 \\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nf(x + 1) = 3 f(x) + 2^x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This gives me a recurrence relation. If I can find \\( f(x) \\) for more values, maybe a pattern will emerge.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating \\( f(2) \\)**\n\nLet's use the recurrence relation to calculate \\( f(2) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(2) = f(1 + 1) = 3 f(1) + 2^1 = 3 \\times 1 + 2 = 5\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Does \\( f(2) \\) = 5 make sense? I'm not sure yet, but at least I have a concrete value to work with.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\( f(3) \\)**\n\nNow, use the recurrence relation to find \\( f(3) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(3) = f(2 + 1) = 3 f(2) + 2^2 = 3 \\times 5 + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Again, I have a concrete number. But does this pattern make sense? Let's see if it continues.\n\n### **Step 4: Looking for a Pattern**\n\nSo far, we have:\n\n- \\( f(1) = 1 \\)\n- \\( f(2) = 5 \\)\n- \\( f(3) = 19 \\)\n\nThis doesn't immediately suggest a simple linear or exponential pattern. However, the growth looks faster than linear, especially from \\( f(2) \\) to \\( f(3) \\).\n\n**Reflection:** Maybe there's a multiplicative component along with an additive one. Let's explore further.\n\n### **Step 5: Re-expressing the Recurrence**\n\nLooking at the recurrence:\n\n\\[\nf(x + 1) = 3 f(x) + 2^x\n\\]\n\nI wonder if separating the linear and exponential parts could help. Let's assume \\( f(x) = A \\cdot 2^x + B \\cdot 3^x \\) and see if that works.\n\n### **Step 6: Assuming an Exponential Form**\n\nLet\u2019s assume:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = A \\cdot 2^x + B \\cdot 3^x\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( f(1) = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\nA \\cdot 2^1 + B \\cdot 3^1 = 1 \\rightarrow 2A + 3B = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This is a system of equations. But I need another equation to solve for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). Let's use the recurrence relation.\n\n### **Step 7: Applying the Recurrence to Find Another Equation**\n\nFrom the recurrence:\n\n\\[\nf(x + 1) = 3 f(x) + 2^x\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\( f(x) = A \\cdot 2^x + B \\cdot 3^x \\), let's express \\( f(x + 1) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x + 1) = A \\cdot 2^{x + 1} + B \\cdot 3^{x + 1} = 2A \\cdot 2^x + 3B \\cdot 3^x\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute into the recurrence:\n\n\\[\n2A \\cdot 2^x + 3B \\cdot 3^x = 3(A \\cdot 2^x + B \\cdot 3^x) + 2^x\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n2A \\cdot 2^x + 3B \\cdot 3^x = 3A \\cdot 2^x + 3B \\cdot 3^x + 2^x\n\\]\n\nGather like terms:\n\n\\[\n(2A - 3A - 1) \\cdot 2^x + (3B - 3B) \\cdot 3^x = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n(-A - 1) \\cdot 2^x = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad A = -1\n\\]\n\n**Check:** With \\( A = -1 \\), let's see if we can find \\( B \\).\n\n### **Step 8: Solving for \\( B \\)**\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n\\[\n2A + 3B = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n2(-1) + 3B = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -2 + 3B = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 3B = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad B = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, \\( A = -1 \\) and \\( B = 1 \\). This gives me:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = -1 \\cdot 2^x + 1 \\cdot 3^x = 3^x - 2^x\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Does this satisfy the original functional equation? Let's test it.\n\n### **Step 9: Verifying the Solution**\n\nPlug \\( f(x) = 3^x - 2^x \\) back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nf(x + y) = 3^y f(x) + 2^x f(y)\n\\]\n\nLeft Side:\n\n\\[\nf(x + y) = 3^{x + y} - 2^{x + y}\n\\]\n\nRight Side:\n\n\\[\n3^y (3^x - 2^x) + 2^x (3^y - 2^y) = 3^{x + y} - 3^y \\cdot 2^x + 2^x \\cdot 3^y - 2^x \\cdot 2^y = 3^{x + y} - 3^y \\cdot 2^x + 2^x \\cdot 3^y - 2^{x + y}\n\\]\n\nSimplify Right Side:\n\n\\[\n3^{x + y} - 2^{x + y}\n\\]\n\nBoth sides are equal:\n\n\\[\n3^{x + y} - 2^{x + y} = 3^{x + y} - 2^{x + y}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This matches perfectly, so our solution seems correct.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy starting with simple checks and identifying a recurrence relation, I was able to explore different strategies. Assuming an exponential form for \\( f(x) \\) led to a system of equations that ultimately revealed the function. Verifying the solution confirmed its correctness.\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected on each step, making sure the approach was leading me in the right direction. Checking the work regularly helped catch and correct any potential mistakes early on.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe function that satisfies the given conditions is:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = 3^x - 2^x\n\\]",
