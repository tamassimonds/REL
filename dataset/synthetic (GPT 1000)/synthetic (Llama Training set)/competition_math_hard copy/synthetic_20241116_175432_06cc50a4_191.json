    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem as we would naturally approach it in real life. I'll start by brainstorming and exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work to ensure I'm on the right path. Let's dive in!\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question, it reminds me of problems involving scheduling and combinatorics \u2014 kind of like the round-robin tournaments I've dealt with before. Here's what pops into my mind:\n\n- **Two Divisions:** Each with **six teams**.\n- **Intradivision Games:** Each team plays every other team in its own division **twice**.\n- **Interdivision Games:** Each team plays every team in the other division **once**.\n\nAt this point, I'm thinking, \"Okay, I need to account for both intradivision and interdivision games. But how do I efficiently calculate the total number of games without double-counting or missing any?\"\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate Intradivision Games First:**\n   - Each team plays every other team in its own division twice. \n   - So, I could compute how many games are played within each division.\n\n2. **Calculate Interdivision Games Next:**\n   - Each team plays every team in the other division once.\n   - So, I need to find out how many games are played between the two divisions.\n\n3. **Total Games by Adding Both:**\n   - The total number of games should be the sum of intradivision and interdivision games.\n\n**Wait**, do I need to consider that each game involves two teams? Because if I count games from both perspectives (home and away), I might double count. Hmmm... Let me think this through.\n\n### **Checking the Approach**\n\n- **Does this Make Sense?** \n  - Yes, calculating intradivision and interdivision separately should work, as long as I account for each game's unique instance (each game is played once, home and away should not need separate counting for interdivision since each is played once).\n\n**Let me proceed with this approach and see where it leads.**\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Intradivision Games**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nEach team plays every other team in its own division **twice**. Therefore, I need to find the total number of unique pairings within each division and then multiply by 2.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Number of Teams in One Division:** 6\n- **Unique Pairings Within a Division:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of unique pairings} = \\frac{6 \\times (6 - 1)}{2} = 15\n  \\]\n  \n  Wait, that seems right because each team plays every other team, and dividing by 2 avoids double-counting each matchup.\n\n- **Total Intradivision Games (Both Divisions):**\n  \\[\n  15 \\times 2 = 30 \\text{ games per division}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Intradivision Games} = 30 \\times 2 = 60\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\nHmm, that feels reasonable. Each division has 30 games, and since there are two divisions, that totals to 60 intradivision games.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Interdivision Games**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nEach team plays every team in the other division **once**. Therefore, I need to find the total number of unique matchups between the two divisions.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Number of Teams in Each Division:** 6\n- **Total Interdivision Games:**\n  \\[\n  6 \\times 6 = 36\n  \\]\n  \n  Wait, this seems straightforward. Each team in one division plays all teams in the other division once, so it's simply \\(6 \\times 6\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThat checks out. Each team has 6 opponents in the other division, so with 6 teams in each division, there are 36 interdivision games.\n\n### **Step 3: Total Conference Games Scheduled**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I'll add the total intradivision and interdivision games to find the overall number of conference games scheduled.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Conference Games} = \\text{Intraconference Games} + \\text{Interconference Games} = 60 + 36 = 96\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n**Wait**, let me double-check this. Intradivision games are 60, and interdivision games are 36. Adding them gives 96 total games. That seems logical because each game is unique and accounted for once.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Intradivision Games:** 60 (30 per division)\n- **Interdivision Games:** 36 (each team plays 6 in the other division)\n- **Total:** 96 games\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe total number of conference games scheduled is **96**.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAt first, I was unsure whether I needed to account for home and away games separately, but reflecting on the problem statement clarified that each game is played once per matchup. By calculating intradivision and interdivision games separately and ensuring each game is counted uniquely, I arrived at a total of 96 games.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, coupled with constant checking and reflection, ensured accuracy in the final answer.",

  "ground_truth": "Each team plays 10 games in its own division and 6 games against teams in the other division. So each of the 12 teams plays 16 conference games. Because each game involves two teams, there are $\\frac{12\\times 16}{2}=\\boxed{96}$ games scheduled."
