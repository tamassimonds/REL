    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk you through my thought process as if I'm thinking it through like a human, complete with brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I notice variables are involved, which often hints at algebraic manipulation. The problem states that Jack and Jill walked at the same speed, so there must be a connection between their speeds and the distances and times given. \n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **\"This looks similar to problems where you equate speed, distance, and time.\"** I remember the formula \\( \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\) being fundamental here.\n- **\"Wait, both speeds are expressed as polynomials.\"** That\u2019s a bit unusual but makes me think polynomial division or factoring might be involved.\n- **\"Maybe I need to simplify the expressions for speed and distance to see the relationship better.\"**\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how to start. So, let's brainstorm different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Speed Formula:** Given \\( \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\), I could find Jill's speed and set it equal to Jack's speed.\n\n2. **Equate the Two Speed Expressions:**\n   - Since both walked at the same speed, set the two expressions equal to each other: \n     \\[\n     x^2 - 11x - 22 = \\frac{x^2 - 3x - 54}{x + 6}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify Each Expression:**\n   - Simplify both Jack's and Jill's speed expressions to see if they can be set equal more straightforwardly.\n\n4. **Factor the Expressions:**\n   - Perhaps factoring both sides might reveal their relationship more clearly.\n\n**Which Looks Best?**\nAt first glance, **equating the two speed expressions** seems the most direct. If I set Jack's speed equal to Jill's speed, I can solve for \\( x \\) and then determine the speed.\n\nBut wait\u2014**\"Is the denominator in Jill's speed expression causing any issues?\"** I recall that dividing polynomials might lead to extraneous solutions, so checking for common factors beforehand could be helpful.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplifying Jill's Speed**\n\nLet's start by simplifying Jill's speed expression to see if anything cancels out.\n\n**Given:**\n- Jill's distance: \\( x^2 - 3x - 54 \\)\n- Jill's time: \\( x + 6 \\)\n\n**Calculate Jill's Speed:**\n\\[\n\\text{Jill's Speed} = \\frac{x^2 - 3x - 54}{x + 6}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n**\"Hmm, can I simplify this fraction?\"** I remember that polynomial long division or factoring might help here.\n\n**Attempting Polynomial Long Division:**\n- Divide \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x \\): \n  \\[\n  x^2 \u00f7 x = x\n  \\]\n  \n- Multiply \\( x \\) by \\( x + 6 \\):\n  \\[\n  x(x + 6) = x^2 + 6x\n  \\]\n  \n- Subtract this from \\( x^2 - 3x - 54 \\):\n  \\[\n  (x^2 - 3x - 54) - (x^2 + 6x) = -9x - 54\n  \\]\n  \n- Divide \\( -9x \\) by \\( x \\):\n  \\[\n  -9x \u00f7 x = -9\n  \\]\n  \n- Multiply \\( -9 \\) by \\( x + 6 \\):\n  \\[\n  -9(x + 6) = -9x - 54\n  \\]\n  \n- Subtract this from \\( -9x - 54 \\):\n  \\[\n  (-9x - 54) - (-9x - 54) = 0\n  \\]\n  \n**Result:**\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2 - 3x - 54}{x + 6} = x - 9\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this make sense? **\"Yes, the remainder is zero, so the division is exact.\"**\n\n**Reflection:**\n**\"Seems like Jill's speed simplifies nicely to \\( x - 9 \\).\"** That\u2019s convenient!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Equate Jack's and Jill's Speeds**\n\nNow that I have both speed expressions, I can set them equal since they walked at the same speed.\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 11x - 22 = x - 9\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n**\"This looks like a quadratic equation setup. I should bring all terms to one side to solve for \\( x \\).\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Rearranging the Equation**\n\nLet's move all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 11x - 22 - x + 9 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Simplify:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 12x - 13 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n**\"Okay, now it\u2019s a standard quadratic equation. Time to solve for \\( x \\) using factoring or the quadratic formula.\"**\n\n**Wait, perhaps factoring could be easier if the numbers are manageable.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Attempting to Factor the Quadratic Equation**\n\nLet's try to factor \\( x^2 - 12x - 13 = 0 \\).\n\n**Thinking:**\n**\"What two numbers multiply to \\(-13\\) and add up to \\(-12\\)?\"**\n\n**Possible Factors of \\(-13\\):**\n- \\( 1 \\) and \\( -13 \\)\n- \\( -1 \\) and \\( 13 \\)\n\n**Check:**\n\\[\n1 \\times (-13) = -13 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 1 + (-13) = -12\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n**\"That works! So, the quadratic can be factored as:\"**\n\n\\[\n(x - 13)(x + 1) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solution for \\( x \\):**\n\\[\nx - 13 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 13\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 1 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n**\"Wait, does \\( x = -1 \\) make sense in this context?\"** Negative speed doesn't make practical sense here.\n\n**Reflection:**\n**\"So, \\( x = -1 \\) is extraneous. Only \\( x = 13 \\) is valid.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Determining the Speed**\n\nNow that I've found \\( x = 13 \\), let's substitute it back into either Jack's or Jill's speed expression to find the speed.\n\n**Using Jill's Simplified Speed:**\n\\[\n\\text{Jill's Speed} = x - 9 = 13 - 9 = 4 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n**\"Does 4 mph make sense as a speed?\"** **\"Honestly, 4 mph seems a bit slow for walking, but since the problem is algebraic, I'll go with it.\"**\n\n**Reflection:**\n**\"Perhaps the context is less important than the mathematical solution here.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Solution**\n\nLet\u2019s verify if both speeds are indeed equal when \\( x = 13 \\).\n\n**Jack's Speed with \\( x = 13 \\):**\n\\[\nx^2 - 11x - 22 = 13^2 - 11(13) - 22 = 169 - 143 - 22 = 4 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\n**Comparison:**\n**\"Wait, Jill's speed is also 4 mph. So both speeds match!\"** That\u2019s reassuring.\n\n**Reflection:**\n**\"This confirms that our solution is correct.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**\"Does the entire process make sense?\"**\n\n- **Brainstorming helped identify the right approach\u2014equating speeds.**\n- **Simplifying Jill's speed was crucial and worked out neatly.**\n- **Factoring the quadratic equation led to the correct solution.**\n- **Checking for extraneous solutions ensured the validity of \\( x = 13 \\).**\n- **Both Jack\u2019s and Jill\u2019s speeds match, confirming the correctness.**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n**\"The solution seems solid. Going through each step methodically ensured I didn't miss anything or end up with an incorrect answer.\"**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**\"The speed at which Jack and Jill walked is \\( \\boxed{4} \\) miles per hour.\"**\n\n---\n\nIn summary, by brainstorming different strategies, carefully simplifying and equating the speed expressions, factoring the resulting quadratic equation, and verifying the solution, we determined that Jack and Jill walked at a speed of **4 miles per hour**. Throughout the process, checking for extraneous solutions and ensuring both speeds matched provided confidence in the correctness of the solution.",
