    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see where our brainstorming takes us. I'll mimic a human thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, checking for correctness, and not hesitating to adjust the approach if things don't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about finding all solutions to \\( f^{-1}(x) = 0 \\) where \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{ax + b} \\) and both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are nonzero constants. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Inverse Functions:** This reminds me of problems involving inverse functions. I recall that to find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), I need to express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) by solving \\( f(y) = x \\).\n- **Setting Inverse to Zero:** The equation \\( f^{-1}(x) = 0 \\) suggests that we're looking for \\( x \\) such that the inverse function equals zero. That\u2019s a bit unusual, but perhaps it means finding \\( x \\) where the original function equals one (since the inverse of zero doesn't exist).\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Find the Inverse Function:** Calculate \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) explicitly and set it to zero.\n  2. **Analyze \\( f(x) \\):** Look for properties or specific values of \\( x \\) directly from \\( f(x) \\) without finding the inverse.\n  3. **Graphical Interpretation:** Consider the graphical representation to understand where the inverse might be zero.\n  \n**Reflections:**\n- **Which Approach to Start With?** Finding the inverse seems straightforward, but I wonder if there\u2019s a quicker way by examining \\( f(x) \\) directly.\n- **Potential Pitfall:** When dealing with inverses, I need to be careful with domain and range issues, especially since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are nonzero.\n\n**Decision:** Let's start by finding the inverse function, as that's the most direct method. If it gets too complicated or doesn't seem right, we'll pivot to another strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Inverse Function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), I need to solve the equation \\( f(y) = x \\) for \\( y \\).\n- The given function is \\( f(y) = \\frac{1}{ay + b} \\).\n  \n**Calculations:**\n1. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{ay + b} = x\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Cross Multiply to Solve for \\( y \\):**\n   \\[\n   1 = x(ay + b)\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Distribute \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   1 =axy + xb\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Isolate Terms Involving \\( y \\):**\n   \\[\n   axy = 1 - xb\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Solve for \\( y \\):**\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{1 - xb}{ax}\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? If \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( y = \\frac{1}{b} \\), which is reasonable.\n- **Verification:** Plugging back into \\( f(y) \\):\n  \\[\n  f\\left(\\frac{1 - xb}{ax}\\right) = \\frac{1}{a\\left(\\frac{1 - xb}{ax}\\right) + b} = \\frac{ax}{1 - xb + b} = x \\quad (\\text{assuming } x \\neq 0)\n  \\]\n  This confirms that our inverse is correct.\n\n**Natural Check:** The inverse seems correct because when I substitute back, it satisfies \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting the Inverse to Zero**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, according to the problem, \\( f^{-1}(x) = 0 \\). So, I set our expression for \\( y \\) to zero:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1 - xb}{ax} = 0\n  \\]\n  \n**Calculations:**\n1. **Set the Numerator to Zero:**\n   \\[\n   1 - xb = 0\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   xb = 1 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{b}\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Does \\( x = \\frac{1}{b} \\) make sense?\n  - If \\( b \\) is nonzero (as given), then \\( x = \\frac{1}{b} \\) is a valid solution.\n  - **Quick Verification:** Plugging \\( x = \\frac{1}{b} \\) back into the inverse:\n    \\[\n    f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{b}\\right) = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{b}b}{a\\frac{1}{b}} = \\frac{0}{\\frac{a}{b}} = 0\n    \\]\n    This checks out.\n\n**Natural Check:** The solution \\( x = \\frac{1}{b} \\) seems correct because it satisfies the equation \\( f^{-1}(x) = 0 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Alternative Approach to Validate the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Even though the inverse method worked, let's see if there's another way to approach this by analyzing \\( f(x) \\) directly.\n- Perhaps there's a property of the function that directly leads to the solution without explicitly finding the inverse.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Fixed Points:** Maybe \\( f(x) \\) has a fixed point where \\( f(x) = 0 \\), but that would imply the function reaches zero, which isn't possible here since \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{ax + b} \\) can never be zero.\n- **Properties of Inverses:** Knowing that \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\), perhaps setting \\( x \\) in such a way makes \\( f^{-1}(x) = 0 \\).\n\n**Realization:**\n- Wait, if \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\), then \\( f^{-1}(x) = 0 \\) implies that \\( f(0) = x \\).\n- So, let's check what \\( f(0) \\) is:\n  \\[\n  f(0) = \\frac{1}{a(0) + b} = \\frac{1}{b}\n  \\]\n  \n**Conclusion:**\n- This means that \\( f^{-1}(0) = \\frac{1}{b} \\), which aligns with our earlier solution.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Both methods agree that \\( x = \\frac{1}{b} \\) is the solution.\n- **Consistency:** The solution makes sense and satisfies the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before finalizing, let's ensure that \\( x = \\frac{1}{b} \\) is indeed the only solution and that all calculations are correct.\n\n**Checks:**\n- **Uniqueness:** The equation \\( 1 - xb = 0 \\) leads to a single solution \\( x = \\frac{1}{b} \\) since it's a linear equation in \\( x \\).\n- **Validity of Constants:** Given that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are nonzero constants, \\( \\frac{1}{b} \\) is well-defined.\n- **No Extraneous Solutions:** Since we derived \\( x = \\frac{1}{b} \\) directly from setting the inverse to zero, there are no extraneous solutions.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- Everything checks out. The solution is consistent across different approaches, and all calculations align with the given function.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe solution to \\( f^{-1}(x) = 0 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{b}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are nonzero constants.",
