    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step and see where we go from here.\n\n### Problem Statement:\nWe have an equation: \\( 361 + 2(19)(6) + 36 = x \\). Our job is to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- Looking at this equation, the first part that stands out is the arithmetic operations: addition and multiplication. \n- It looks fairly simple at a glance, but I want to make sure I compute everything diligently and accurately. \n- This problem feels straightforward because I see separate parts that I can tackle before combining them to find \\( x \\).\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Calculate each component separately**: First, I will compute the multiplication parts and the individual numbers.\n2. **Combine the results**: After finding the values of the expressions, I'll add everything up.\n3. **Verify the results**: I'll make sure that every small calculation is accurate before proceeding to sum everything up.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n#### Step 1: Calculating the Multiplication\n\n- **First Multiplication**: \\( 2(19)(6) \\)\n  - Start by computing \\( 19 \\times 6 \\).\n  - \\( 19 \\times 6 = 114 \\). \n  - Hmm, let me quickly check and confirm. Multiplying again: \\( 20 \\times 6 - 1 \\times 6 \\) gives me \\( 120 - 6 = 114 \\). Yes, that seems correct.\n  - Now, multiply by 2: \\( 2 \\times 114 = 228 \\).\n  - Let's think about that: \\( 2 \\times 114 \\), okay, if I were to double it directly, it's \\( 228 \\). Good, feels right.\n\n#### Step 2: Calculate the Remaining Components\n\n- **Direct Numbers**:\n  - We have 361 and 36, which are straightforward and need no computation.\n\n#### Step 3: Combine Everything\n\n- **Adding Values**:\n  - We have \\( 361 \\) from the original standalone number.\n  - \\( 228 \\) from \\( 2(19)(6) \\).\n  - And \\( 36 \\) from the additional standalone number.\n  - Now, let's go ahead and sum these numbers: \n    - \\( 361 + 228 = 589 \\)\n    - Then, \\( 589 + 36 = 625 \\)\n\n#### Final Calculation:\n\n- So, after adding all numbers \\( 361 + 228 + 36 \\), I get \\( 625 \\).\n- I'm going to recheck quickly to ensure everything was computed correctly, but it does all add up logically.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Thus, the solution to the equation \\( 361 + 2(19)(6) + 36 = x \\) is \\( x = 625 \\).\n\nI feel confident in this result after verifying each calculation point. Everything aligns logically with the arithmetic rules and steps involved. \n\nIt's always satisfying when things check out step by step and logic prevails! If there were any deeper insights or simplifications, I\u2019d pursue another approach, but sometimes being methodical is the most straightforward route.",

  "ground_truth": "We note that $361=19^2$ and $36=6^2$, so $x=19^2+2(19)(6)+6^2$. This is just the binomial expansion of $(19+6)^2=25^2=\\boxed{625}$."
