  "problem": "A certain organization consists of five leaders and some number of regular members. Every year, the current leaders are kicked out of the organization. Next, each regular member must find two new people to join as regular members. Finally, five new people are elected from outside the organization to become leaders. In the beginning, there are fifteen people in the organization total. How many people total will be in the organization five years from now?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem, step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: This looks like a problem about exponential growth, given the doubling of regular members each year and the removal of leaders. Initially, I don't see an obvious formula that applies, but it seems similar to problems I've tackled before involving recursive sequences or geometric series.\n\n**What's given?**\n\n- There are 5 leaders and an unspecified number of regular members. \n- Every year, leaders are removed.\n- Each regular member recruits 2 new regular members (doubling the number of regular members plus additional growth).\n- 5 new leaders are elected from outside each year.\n- Initial organization size is 15 people total.\n\n**Objective:** Find the total number of people in the organization in 5 years.\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Initial Condition\n\nWe know there are 15 people total initially, consisting of 5 leaders. Hence, there are \\(15 - 5 = 10\\) regular members to start with.\n\n### Step 3: Understand Yearly Changes\n\n**Annual changes:**\n1. Remove 5 leaders.\n2. Each regular member recruits 2 new members. This suggests each regular member increases the total by 2 people rather than doubling (i.e., each contributes a net +2 to total regular members, after replacement).\n3. Elect 5 new leaders from outside the current members.\n\n**Reevaluate Thought Process:**\nWait, let's clarify the regular members' growth. If each one brings 2 more people, each regular effectively triples (original plus 2 new ones). But since we're not doubling the total population, this confirms: each member at time \\( t \\) triples including itself, so our total will reflect \\( 3 \\times \\) current regular members, but with the structure there is a precise increase pattern to track.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Year-by-Year\n\n1. **Year 0:**\n   - Leaders: 5\n   - Regular members: 10\n   - **Total:** \\( 15 \\)\n\n2. **Year 1:**\n   - Regular members: \\( 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\) (triple original number; includes themselves)\n   - Add 5 new leaders, who're external\n   - **Total:** \\( 30 + 5 = 35 \\)\n\n3. **Year 2:**\n   - Regular members: \\( 30 \\times 3 = 90 \\)\n   - Add 5 new leaders\n   - **Total:** \\( 90 + 5 = 95 \\)\n\n4. **Year 3:**\n   - Regular members: \\( 90 \\times 3 = 270 \\)\n   - Add 5 new leaders\n   - **Total:** \\( 270 + 5 = 275 \\)\n\n5. **Year 4:**\n   - Regular members: \\( 270 \\times 3 = 810 \\)\n   - Add 5 new leaders\n   - **Total:** \\( 810 + 5 = 815 \\)\n\n6. **Year 5:**\n   - Regular members: \\( 810 \\times 3 = 2430 \\)\n   - Add 5 new leaders\n   - **Total:** \\( 2430 + 5 = 2435 \\)\n\n### Step 5: Reflect and Verify\n\nGiven this pattern, the growth is indeed exponential with respect to the regular members. The leaders remain at a constant influx of 5 from outside the organization, unaffected by the exponential increase.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe total number of people in the organization five years from now will be **2,435**. This mess of trying to categorize growth in context shows the importance of breaking each assumption down, especially with exponential patterns.\n\n**Check:** Verifying calculations seems consistent each year with the problem statement rules. A quick review confirms both arithmetic and logic follow correctly.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $a_k$ denote the number of people in year $k$ (with initially $k=0$). One might notice that after the leaders are kicked out, there are $a_k-5$ regular members. Then, there are $3(a_k-5)$ regular members after the new regular members join. Finally, after the new leaders are elected, we have a grand total of $3(a_k-5)+5 = 3a_k-10$ people the next year. One might wish to solve this recursion with $a_0=15$. But there is an easier way.\n\nNotice that the number of leaders stays the same each year, and the number of regular members triples. Thus the number of regular members follows a geometric sequence. In the beginning, there are $15-5=10$ regular members. Therefore, five years later, there will be $(3^5)(10)=2430$ regular members. The total number of people will be $5+2430=\\boxed{2435}$."
