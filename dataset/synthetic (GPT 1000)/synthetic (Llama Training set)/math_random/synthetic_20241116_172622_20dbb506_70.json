    "working_out": "Alright, let's jump into this problem and understand what's being asked. We're asked to simplify the expression \\((10^{0.5})(10^{0.3})(10^{0.2})(10^{0.1})(10^{0.9})\\). At a glance, this looks like a problem involving the properties of exponents.\n\nFirst thoughts:\n\n- This reminds me of the rule for multiplying exponents with the same base. If \\(a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}\\), can we apply this here? All the terms have the same base of 10, so this might work.\n- It seems like a simple addition of exponents is needed. But let's break it down step by step to confirm this is the correct and complete approach.\n\nLet's try to apply what I remember about exponents:\n\n1. **Applying the property of exponents:**\n\n   Since the property states that you can add the exponents when multiplying terms with the same base, I think we can directly add all those exponents together.\n\n   So, let's write that out explicitly:\n\n   - \\(0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.9\\).\n\n   Now, let's do that addition:\n\n   - \\(0.5 + 0.3 = 0.8\\).\n   - Then, \\(0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0\\).\n   - Next, add \\(0.1\\) to give \\(1.1\\).\n   - Finally, adding \\(0.9\\) gives us \\(2.0\\).\n\n2. **Reflect and check:**\n\n   Wait a moment, does this make sense? I added up all the exponents for the similar base 10. Yes, this matches the rule for exponents. It appears everything adds up correctly.\n\n3. **Simplifying further:**\n\n   Now that we\u2019ve found the sum of the exponents, we return to our original base of 10 with the combined exponent:\n\n   \\[ 10^{0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.9} = 10^{2.0} \\]\n\n   And simplifying further, this is just:\n\n   \\[ 10^2 = 100 \\]\n\n4. **Final check:**\n\n   Let me quickly think, does this feel right? The problem didn\u2019t throw any curveballs outside of basic exponent rules. Our answer is the square of 10, which should be 100. Seems reasonable based on the steps and calculations.\n\nAfter working through it, every step seems solid, and the calculations line up with my understanding of exponent properties. Thus, the simplified value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).",
