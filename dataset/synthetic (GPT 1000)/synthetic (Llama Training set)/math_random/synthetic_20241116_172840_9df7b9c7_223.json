    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\nAlright, we need to find \\(a + b + c\\) for the quadratic function \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\). We know it has a maximum value of 54 and passes through the points \\((-2, 0)\\) and \\((4, 0)\\). This means \\((-2, 0)\\) and \\((4, 0)\\) are the roots of the quadratic equation. Because it has a maximum, this parabola opens downwards, so \\(a < 0\\).\n\nSince we know both roots of the quadratic, I can immediately think of the form \\(y = a(x + 2)(x - 4)\\) using the roots. I need to expand this and find \\(a\\) using the maximum value.\n\nLet\u2019s derive some equations:\n\n1. **Using roots to form expression**:  \n   The standard factorized form, considering the roots, is:\n   \\[\n   y = a(x + 2)(x - 4)\n   \\]\n   Expanding this:\n   \\[\n   y = a(x^2 - 4x + 2x - 8) = a(x^2 - 2x - 8)\n   \\]\n   Thus, \n   \\[\n   y = ax^2 - 2ax - 8a\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify maximum value:**  \n   We are told the maximum value is 54. For the quadratic \\(ax^2 - 2ax - 8a\\), the maximum occurs at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex for \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) is \\(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\). For our current expansion, \\(b = -2a\\), so the x-coordinate of the vertex is:\n   \\[\n   x = -\\frac{-2a}{2a} = 1\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(x = 1\\) into the equation should give us the maximum value:\n   \\[\n   y(1) = a(1)^2 - 2a(1) - 8a = 54\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   a - 2a - 8a = 54 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -9a = 54 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = -6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Verify and find \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):**  \n   Now, substituting \\(a = -6\\) in the expression:\n   \\[\n   y = -6(x^2 - 2x - 8) = -6x^2 + 12x + 48\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(a = -6\\), \\(b = 12\\), and \\(c = 48\\). \n\n4. **Calculate \\(a + b + c\\):**  \n   Sum these values to get:\n   \\[\n   a + b + c = -6 + 12 + 48 = 54\n   \\]\n\nReflection:\n\nEverything seems to check out. For a final check, I consider the roots equation already proven \\((y=0)\\) when \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=4\\). Both values confirmed the setup initially. \n\nThus, the calculated \\(a + b + c\\) value appears correct. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{54}\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "Since the graph passes through the points $(-2,0)$ and $(4,0),$ the equation is of the form $a(x + 2)(x - 4).$\n\nThe graph has a maximum, and this maximum value occurs at the average of $-2$ and 4, namely $x = \\frac{-2 + 4}{2} = 1.$  But $a + b + c$ is exactly the value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ at $x = 1,$ so $a + b + c = \\boxed{54}.$"
