    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\nOkay, let's break this down step by step. We are given an inequality: \\( 10 < -x + 13 \\). At first glance, this looks like a linear inequality, the kind involving rearranging terms. But before diving in, let me just note that the inequality requires values of \\( x \\) such that the transformed value of \\( -x \\) adds to \\( 13 \\), making the sum greater than \\( 10 \\). Feels like there's going to be some simple algebraic manipulation.\n\nInitial Strategy:\n\nMy first instinct is to isolate \\( x \\) and then determine the range of integer values that satisfy this condition. For inequalities, solving them is much like solving equations, except that we have to be mindful of the inequality sign and what it means in terms of operations, especially multiplying or dividing by negative numbers. \n\nLet's give it a go:\n\n1. **Rearrange the inequality to isolate \\( x \\).**\n\n   Start with the original inequality:\n   \\[\n   10 < -x + 13\n   \\]\n\n   My next step, I think I'll subtract 13 from both sides to keep it balanced:\n   \\[\n   10 - 13 < -x\n   \\]\n\n   Performing the subtraction:\n   \\[\n   -3 < -x\n   \\]\n\n   Hmm, okay, now \\( -x \\) is on its own paired with \\(-3\\). It looks like, to solve for \\( x \\), I\u2019m going to have to deal with this negative sign. Let\u2019s reflect a moment\u2014remembering that when you multiply or divide by a negative, the inequality direction switches...\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\) and Adjust the Inequality Sign.**\n\n   To extinguish the negative sign on \\( -x \\), multiply both sides by \\(-1\\), and don't forget to flip the inequality:\n   \\[\n   3 > x\n   \\]\n\n   This rearranges to:\n   \\[\n   x < 3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Range of Positive Integer Solutions.**\n\n   Now, I have \\( x < 3 \\). My task is to find positive integers. The integers less than 3 are \\( 1 \\) and \\( 2 \\). Let me double check: \n   \\[\n   1 < 3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2 < 3\n   \\]\n\n   These both satisfy the condition of being positive and also being less than 3.\n\n5. **Conclusion and Verification:**\n\n   Hence, the positive integer solutions to the original inequality include \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n   What about checking this briefly? Plugging back into the original inequality:\n   - For \\( x = 1 \\): \n     \\[\n     10 < -1 + 13 \\Rightarrow 10 < 12 \\quad \\text{True}\n     \\]\n   - For \\( x = 2 \\):\n     \\[\n     10 < -2 + 13 \\Rightarrow 10 < 11 \\quad \\text{True}\n     \\]\n     \n   Everything checks out logically and mathematically.\n\nFinal Answer: The possible positive integer values of \\( x \\) that satisfy \\( 10 < -x + 13 \\) are 1 and 2. The total number of solutions is 2.",
