We're given that the polynomial \\(x^2 + 2x + 5\\) is a factor of another polynomial \\(x^4 + Px^2 + Q\\). The goal is to find the values of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), and then determine the sum \\(P + Q\\).\n\nMy first thought is that when one polynomial is a factor of another, it divides it exactly with no remainder. This reminds me of polynomial division or using the Remainder Theorem. But since we're dealing with factors, maybe we should explore factorization here.\n\n### Step 2: Connecting to Known Concepts\n\nHmm, factoring \\(x^4 + Px^2 + Q\\) directly seems complex. Let's explore a potential factorization strategy, considering:\n\n- \\(x^4 + Px^2 + Q\\) must factor completely if \\(x^2 + 2x + 5\\) is one of its factors.\n  \nThis means that \\((x^2 + 2x + 5)\\) must possibly multiply with another quadratic to give us our degree 4 polynomial. So, let's try expressing:\n\\[x^4 + Px^2 + Q = (x^2 + 2x + 5)(x^2 + Ax + B)\\]\n\n### Step 3: Expanding the Expression\n\nOkay, time to expand the right-hand side:\n\n- \\((x^2)(x^2) = x^4\\)\n- \\((x^2)(Ax) = Ax^3\\)\n- \\((x^2)(B) = Bx^2\\)\n- \\((2x)(x^2) = 2x^3\\)\n- \\((2x)(Ax) = 2Ax^2\\)\n- \\((2x)(B) = 2Bx\\)\n- \\((5)(x^2) = 5x^2\\)\n- \\((5)(Ax) = 5Ax\\)\n- \\((5)(B) = 5B\\)\n\nBringing it together:\n\\[ x^4 + (A + 2)x^3 + (B + 2A + 5)x^2 + (2B + 5A)x + 5B \\]\n\n### Step 4: Identifying Coefficients\n\nSince we want this expression to simplify to \\(x^4 + Px^2 + Q\\), let's match the coefficients with:\n\n- \\(x^4\\) term: As expected, perfectly aligns since we only have \\(x^4\\) on both sides.\n\n- \\(x^3\\) term: There's no \\(x^3\\) term in \\(x^4 + Px^2 + Q\\), hence \\(A + 2 = 0\\). This gives:\n  \\[ A = -2 \\]\n\n- \\(x^2\\) term: We need \\(B + 2A + 5 = P\\). We already know \\(A = -2\\):\n  \\[ B - 4 + 5 = P \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad B + 1 = P \\]\n\n- \\(x\\) term: Similarly, there is no \\(x\\) term on the left side, so:\n  \\[ 2B + 5A = 0 \\]\n  Substituting \\(A = -2\\):\n  \\[ 2B - 10 = 0 \\]\n  \\[ 2B = 10 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad B = 5 \\]\n\n- Constant term: Finally, matching the constants:\n  \\[ 5B = Q \\]\n  Substituting \\(B = 5\\):\n  \\[ 5 \\times 5 = Q \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad Q = 25 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculations\n\nNow we have \\(B = 5\\) and using \\(B + 1 = P\\):\n\\[ P = 5 + 1 = 6 \\]\n\nThus, \\(P = 6\\) and \\(Q = 25\\). Therefore:\n\\[ P + Q = 6 + 25 = 31 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nAlright! It seems like everything is matching up perfectly. The left and right sides align, and there were no inconsistencies found in simplifications or calculations. Therefore, the sum \\(P + Q\\) is \\(\\boxed{31}\\). I'm satisfied this method has led to the correct solution.",
