    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Initially, it might seem complicated, but let's break it down step by step and see where it takes us. \n\n### Understanding the Problem:\n\nFirst, let's identify what's given in the problem and what's being asked:\n\n- **Total students** = 40\n- **Students liking apple pie** = 18\n- **Students liking chocolate cake** = 15\n- **Students who don't like either** = 12\n- **Objective** = Find how many students liked both apple pie and chocolate cake.\n\nThis reminds me of problems involving sets and Venn diagrams. Here, I've got two overlapping sets: those who like apple pie and those who like chocolate cake. Not everyone falls into these sets, since some don't like either.\n\n### Step 1: Determine Students Involved in Liking At Least One Dessert\n\nTo begin, let's figure out how many students are involved in liking either apple pie or chocolate cake or both (since 12 students don't like either):\n\n- Total students liking at least one dessert = Total students - Students who don't like either\n- Total liking at least one = 40 - 12 = 28\n\nThis means 28 students like at least one of the desserts (apple pie or chocolate cake or both).\n\n### Step 2: Use Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n\nNext, we'll apply the inclusion-exclusion principle to find out how many like both:\n\n- Formula used: Total liking at least one = Liking apple pie + Liking chocolate cake - Liking both\n\nLet's plug in the numbers we know:\n\n- 28 (found in Step 1) = 18 (apple pie) + 15 (chocolate cake) - Both\n\nWith this setup, we can solve for \"Both\":\n\n- 28 = 18 + 15 - Both\n- 28 = 33 - Both\n\nThis looks off. Wait, am I making a mistake here? Let's see.\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \"Both\"\n\nQuick check doesn't feel right, but let's rearrange to solve:\n\n- Both = 33 - 28\n- Both = 5\n\n### Step 4: Verify\n\nNow, let's verify by confirming numbers make sense:\n\n- Apple only = Liking apple pie - Both = 18 - 5 = 13\n- Chocolate only = Liking chocolate cake - Both = 15 - 5 = 10\n- Both = 5\n- Neither = 12\n\nAdding these up:\n\n- Total liking any dessert = Apple only + Chocolate only + Both = 13 + 10 + 5 = 28\n- Add those not liking either: 28 + 12 = 40\n\nThe total matches the number of students in the class, confirming our solution seems correct.\n\n### Reflection\n\nThis approach using the inclusion-exclusion principle is effective for this problem. Initially, double-checking and quick mental recalculations helped ensure accuracy.\n\n**Conclusion:** 5 students like both apple pie and chocolate cake.\n\nIf I missed anything, feel free to point it out, and I'll adjust accordingly. It's always useful reviewing steps to catch any potential errors.",

  },
  "ground_truth": "Of the $40$ students, $12$ did not like either dessert. Therefore, $40-12=28$ students liked at least one of the desserts. But $18$ students said they liked apple pie, $15$ said they liked chocolate cake, and $18+15=33,$ so $33-28=\\boxed{5}$ students must have liked both of the desserts."
