    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem about finding the distance between the foci of an ellipse. Here's how I would approach it step-by-step, letting my thoughts flow naturally.\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Strategy\n\nWhen I first read the equation \\(16x^2 - 64x + y^2 + 4y + 4 = 0\\), it strikes me that this is a conic section, specifically an ellipse due to the different coefficients on \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\). My goal is to express the equation in the standard form of an ellipse, which is \\(\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1\\).\n\nTo achieve this, I'll need to complete the square for both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms. This is familiar ground as I've worked on similar problems in the past.\n\n### Completing the Square\n\nStarting with the \\(x\\)-terms:\n- The terms \\(16x^2 - 64x\\) look daunting because of the coefficient on \\(x^2\\), but let's tackle it.\n- First, factor out the 16: \\(16(x^2 - 4x)\\).\n- To complete the square: what number turns \\(x^2 - 4x\\) into a perfect square? Lay it out: \\((x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4\\).\n- Add and subtract 4: \\(16(x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4)\\), which simplifies to \\(16((x - 2)^2 - 4)\\).\n\nHmm, so this becomes: \n\n\\[16(x - 2)^2 - 64.\\]\n\nGood; I'll need to add 64 to the other side as part of maintaining equality.\n\nFor the \\(y\\)-terms:\n- The terms are \\(y^2 + 4y\\).\n- I know the routine: \\((y + 2)^2 = y^2 + 4y + 4\\).\n- So, add and subtract 4: \\((y + 2)^2 - 4\\).\n\nThat gives us: \n\n\\((y + 2)^2 - 4\\).\n\nNow, putting these changes into the equation:\n\n\\[16(x-2)^2 - 64 + (y+2)^2 - 4 + 4 = 0.\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[16(x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 64.\\]\n\n### Reflecting\n\nLet\u2019s take a pause here. Bringing everything over to keep things tidy, divide the whole equation by 64 to form a standard ellipse equation:\n\n\\[\\frac{(x-2)^2}{4} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{64} = 1.\\]\n\nThis confirms it's an ellipse! The major axis is along the \\(y\\)-direction because the denominator of \\((y+2)^2\\) is larger.\n\n### Finding the Foci\n\nFor an ellipse centered at \\((h,k)\\) with a vertical major axis, the distance to each focus \\(c\\) (from the center) is given by the relation \\(c = \\sqrt{b^2 - a^2}\\) where \\(b > a\\).\n\nHere \\(b^2 = 64\\) and \\(a^2 = 4\\).\n\nSo compute \\(c\\):\n\n\\[c = \\sqrt{64 - 4} = \\sqrt{60} = 2\\sqrt{15}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance between the foci is \\(2c = 4\\sqrt{15}\\).\n\n### Final Reflection\n\nLet\u2019s recap: By completing the square, confirming it\u2019s an ellipse, and accurately using the formulae, we deduced the distance between the foci. Everything checks out so far. That was straightforward after reorganizing the equation correctly and remembering the geometry of an ellipse.\n\nThis holistic and thorough look into the process verifies our solution. Answer: The distance between the foci is \\(4\\sqrt{15}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get\n\\[16(x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 64.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{(x - 2)^2}{4} + \\frac{(y + 2)^2}{64} = 1.\\]Thus, $a = 8$ and $b = 2,$ so $c = \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = \\sqrt{60} = 2 \\sqrt{15}.$  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = \\boxed{4 \\sqrt{15}}.$"
