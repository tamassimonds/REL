  "problem": "Coach Grunt is preparing the 5-person starting lineup for his basketball team, the Grunters.  There are 12 players on the team.  Two of them, Ace and Zeppo, are league All-Stars, so they'll definitely be in the starting lineup.  How many different starting lineups are possible?  (The order of the players in a basketball lineup doesn't matter.)",

    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into the problem and think through it step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem:\n\nFirst thoughts: *This problem seems related to combinations, given we are selecting a subset of players from a larger group, but with constraints. We know Ace and Zeppo have to be in this lineup, which simplifies things somewhat. The challenge lies in determining the different combinations of the remaining players.*\n\nWe have:\n- A total of 12 players on the team.\n- Ace and Zeppo are already selected, so we only need to choose 3 more players for the 5-person lineup.\n- With Ace and Zeppo fixed, we now consider how many ways we can select the remaining 3 players from the 10 players left.\n\n### Working Through the Solution:\n\n**Step 1: Define the Task Clearly**\n\nWe are trying to find the number of ways to select 3 players from a pool of 10. It sounds like a combinations problem. The order of players doesn't matter, we just need to select them.\n\nThinking about combinations: *This reminds me of calculating \"n choose k\", which is often used for these kinds of problems.*\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Combinations**\n\nThe formula for combinations \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k! \\cdot (n-k)!}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(n = 10\\) and \\(k = 3\\), since we have 10 players left after picking Ace and Zeppo, and we need to choose 3 more.\n\nSo, applying the formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10!}{3! \\cdot (10-3)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Calculation**\n\nLet's compute that:\n- Numerator: \\(10 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 720\\)\n- Denominator: \\(3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n\nSo:\n\\[\n\\frac{720}{6} = 120\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Reflection and Verification**\n\nThis looks reasonable; the steps make sense. We accounted for Ace and Zeppo being fixed in the lineup, reduced it to a simpler problem of choosing 3 from 10.\n\n**Step 5: Possible Alternative Thoughts or Checks**\n\n*Quick check: Could there be another simpler way? Not really, combinations seem directly applicable here.*\n\nI\u2019m pretty confident in this solution, as it correctly addresses the constraints of the problem. The computation aligns well with the problem requirements and solution method.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThere are 120 different ways Coach Grunt can choose the starting lineup, with Ace and Zeppo already selected. \n\nThis process of choosing 3 players from a remaining pool of 10 captures the essence of what was needed here!",

  "ground_truth": "Coach Grunt has to choose 3 players from the 10 players that are remaining after Ace and Zeppo have been placed in the lineup.  The order in which the players are chosen doesn't matter, so the answer is $$ \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\boxed{120}. $$"
