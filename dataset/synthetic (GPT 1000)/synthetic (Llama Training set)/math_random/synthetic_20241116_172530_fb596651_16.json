    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem of writing \\(0.\\overline{43}\\) as a simplified fraction. I'll think through this step by step, starting with my initial thoughts.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see \\(0.\\overline{43}\\), I recognize that it is a repeating decimal. Knowing from previous experiences, there is a common method of converting repeating decimals into fractions using algebraic techniques. This reminds me of a classic problem I've solved before, but let's outline a few strategies to see which might work best.\n\n**Strategy Exploration:**\n\n1. **Algebraic Method:** This involves setting the decimal equal to a variable and manipulating equations. I've used this before and remember it's pretty reliable.\n\n2. **Series Approach:** Repeating decimals can sometimes be viewed as geometric series. However, this might become cumbersome for longer repeating sequences.\n\n3. **Decimal to Fraction Conversion:** Using knowledge of repeating decimals directly converting them using multiplication and subtraction. This looks similar to Method 1.\n\nThe algebraic method seems the most straightforward. I'll begin there.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution Using the Algebraic Method:**\n\n1. **Define a Variable:**\n\n   Let \\( x = 0.\\overline{43} \\).\n   \n   This means \\( x = 0.43434343...\\).\n\n2. **Eliminate the Repeat by Aligning Decimals:**\n\n   Multiply both sides by 100 (since there are two repeating digits) to shift the decimal two places:\n   \n   \\[ 100x = 43.434343... \\]\n\n3. **Subtract to Eliminate the Repeats:**\n\n   Now subtract the original equation from this new equation:\n   \n   \\[ 100x - x = 43.434343... - 0.434343... \\]\n\n   \\[ 99x = 43 \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n\n   Divide both sides by 99:\n\n   \\[ x = \\frac{43}{99} \\]\n\n5. **Check for Simplification:**\n\n   Check if the fraction \\(\\frac{43}{99}\\) can be simplified:\n\n   - 43 is a prime number.\n   - Check if 43 divides 99 evenly: \\(99 \\div 43 \\approx 2.3\\), which means no integer division.\n   - Therefore, \\(\\frac{43}{99}\\) is in its simplest form.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n\n   To ensure accuracy, compute the decimal equivalent of \\(\\frac{43}{99}\\) using a calculator:\n   \n   \\(\\frac{43}{99} \\approx 0.434343...\\), which matches \\(0.\\overline{43}\\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThe algebraic method worked just as I remembered, yielding the correct result. My checks confirmed the solution is correct. This problem indeed reminded me of similar repeating decimal conversions and the approach matched well without needing alternative methods. Hence, the fraction \\(\\frac{43}{99}\\) is the simplest form of \\(0.\\overline{43}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Let $a=0.\\overline{43}$. Then $100a=43.\\overline{43}$. Subtracting the left-hand sides $100a$ and $a$, and subtracting the right-hand sides $43.\\overline{43}$ and $0.\\overline{43}$ yields \\begin{align*} 100a- a &= 43.\\overline{43}- 0.\\overline{43}\\\\ \\Rightarrow 99a &= 43\\\\ \\Rightarrow a &= \\boxed{\\frac{43}{99}}. \\end{align*}"
