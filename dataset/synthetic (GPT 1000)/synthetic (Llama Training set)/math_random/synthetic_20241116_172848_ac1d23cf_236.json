    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The task is to find all the possible numbers of students that can sit in each row at Tom's graduation, given the constraints, and then find the sum of those possible numbers. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe've got 288 students in total, and they need to be seated in rows with:\n- At least 10 rows.\n- At least 15 students per row.\n\nThis probably means we're looking for divisors of 288 that satisfy those conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Explore initial thoughts and strategies\nFirst thoughts:\n- This looks like a factorization problem because the students need to be split evenly into rows and columns, like factors of 288.\n- I need numbers that are both factors of 288 and meet the constraints of a minimum number of rows and students per row.\n- Let's start identifying the factors of 288.\n\n### Step 3: Factorization of 288\n288 is even, so I can start dividing by 2:\n\\[ 288 \\div 2 = 144 \\]\n\\[ 144 \\div 2 = 72 \\]\n\\[ 72 \\div 2 = 36 \\]\n\\[ 36 \\div 2 = 18 \\]\n\\[ 18 \\div 2 = 9 \\]\n\\[ 9 \\div 3 = 3 \\]\n\\[ 3 \\div 3 = 1 \\]\n\nSo, \\( 288 = 2^5 \\times 3^2 \\).\n\nWith this factorization, I now need to list possible divisors.\n\n### Step 4: List possible divisors\nUsing the prime factorization, the factors are:\n- \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 32, 36, 48, 72, 96, 144, 288\\).\n\n### Step 5: Apply the constraints\nNow, I need to apply the constraints:\n- At least 10 rows: The number of rows, \\(288/x \\geq 10\\).\n- At least 15 students per row: \\(x \\geq 15\\).\n\nSo I\u2019m looking for values where \\(10 \\leq 288/x\\) and \\(x \\geq 15\\).\n\nRearranging the first inequality gives: \n\\[ x \\leq 28.8 \\].\nSince \\(x\\) must be an integer, \\(x \\leq 28\\).\n\n### Step 6: Identify valid values of \\(x\\)\nGiven \\(15 \\leq x \\leq 28\\) and \\(x\\) is a factor of 288, check each possible \\(x\\):\n- From our factor list, within the range \\(x \\geq 15\\) and \\(x \\leq 28\\), valid values are: \\(16, 18, 24\\).\n\n### Step 7: Sum the valid values\nAdding the valid numbers:\n\\[ 16 + 18 + 24 = 58 \\].\n\n### Conclusion\nThe sum of all possible values of \\(x\\) is \\(58\\). This seems correct based on our constraints and checks. I\u2019m confident in this solution because it took into account all the constraints and necessary calculations. Everything checks out with this particular setup.",

  "ground_truth": "If $x$ students sit in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=288=2^5\\cdot3^2$. Given that $x\\ge15$ and $y\\ge10$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^4=16$, $2^3\\cdot3=24$, and $2\\cdot3^2=18$. Their sum is $16+24+18=\\boxed{58}$."
