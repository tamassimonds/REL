    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We have an equation \\((x-5)(2x+9) = x^2 - 13x + 40\\) with two distinct solutions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), and we need to find \\((p+3)(q+3)\\).\n\n**First Impressions and Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - This equation involves a quadratic expression and transformation into and comparison with another quadratic form.\n   - I'm expecting the usual strategies of solving quadratics might apply here.\n\n2. **Strategy Brainstorming:**\n   - My first thought is to expand \\((x-5)(2x+9)\\) and see if it matches or simplifies to \\(x^2 - 13x + 40\\).\n   - Another angle is treating each side as a pure quadratic and solving both for their roots.\n   - Could also consider equating coefficients after expanding.\n\n3. **Choosing the Approach:**\n   - Let's start by expanding the product on the left-hand side to see the full form of each quadratic.\n   - If that leads to something engaging or revealing, I'll take further steps from there.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Expansion:**\n   - Start with expanding \\((x-5)(2x+9)\\):\n     \\[\n     (x-5)(2x+9) = x(2x + 9) - 5(2x + 9)\n     \\]\n     Calculating each term separately:\n     \\[\n     x \\cdot 2x + x \\cdot 9 - 5 \\cdot 2x - 5 \\cdot 9\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = 2x^2 + 9x - 10x - 45 = 2x^2 - x - 45\n     \\]\n\n2. **Equate with the Right-Hand Side:**\n   - We have \\(2x^2 - x - 45 = x^2 - 13x + 40\\).\n\n3. **Simplify:**\n   - Rearrange to form a standard quadratic equation:\n     \\[\n     2x^2 - x - 45 - x^2 + 13x - 40 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x^2 + 12x - 85 = 0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Roots of the Equation:**\n   - Use the quadratic formula: \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\)\n   - For \\(x^2 + 12x - 85 = 0\\), \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 12\\), \\(c = -85\\).\n   - Calculate the discriminant: \\(b^2 - 4ac = 12^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-85) = 144 + 340 = 484\\).\n   - Since 484 is a perfect square (22 squared), the roots \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are real and distinct.\n   - Calculate:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-12 \\pm 22}{2}\n     \\]\n     - For positive, \\(x = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\\).\n     - For negative, \\(x = \\frac{-34}{2} = -17\\).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Check the roots satisfy original quadratic \\(x^2 + 12x - 85\\):\n     - Substitute \\(x = 5\\): \\(25 + 60 - 85 = 0\\).\n     - Substitute \\(x = -17\\): \\(289 - 204 - 85 = 0\\).\n\n6. **Calculate \\((p + 3)(q + 3)\\):**\n   - Here, \\(p = 5\\) and \\(q = -17\\), calculate each:\n     \\[\n     (p + 3)(q + 3) = (5 + 3)(-17 + 3) = 8 \\cdot (-14)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = -112\n     \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Every step aligns correctly, and calculations reflect consistent actions consistent with solving systems of quadratics.\n- Both the roots calculation and the final product check out perfect and detailed, ensuring all work is precise.\n\nSo the final answer is \\((p + 3)(q + 3) = -112\\).",

  "ground_truth": "We can expand the left side to simplify, or we might notice that $x^2-13x+40 = (x-5)(x-8).$ Thus, we see that $(x-5)(2x+9) = (x-5)(x-8).$ Simplifying, we have $(x-5)(2x+9) - (x-5)(x-8) = (x-5)(x+17) = 0.$ Therefore, $p$ and $q$ are 5 and -17, and $(p + 3)(q + 3) = (8) (-14) = \\boxed{-112}.$"
