An integer is represented on both squares, and each integer 0-9 is paired with every integer 0-9 exactly once to form a complete set.

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this domino probability problem. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with a complete set of dominoes. The idea of dominoes with numbers 0-9 is already forming in my head. I know a set of dominoes usually pairs each number with every other number (including itself), which means the standard classic double-six set must expand here to double-nine given our numbers 0-9.\n\n#### The Problem Components\n\n1. **Double Dominioes:** These are tiles with the same numbers on both squares. \n2. **Complete Set:** Every number from 0 to 9 paired with every other number from 0 to 9.\n3. **Probability Call:** What are the chances a randomly picked domino will be a double?\n\n### Brainstorming the Approach\n\n- **Understanding doubles count:** Need to figure out how many doubles exist.\n- **Total dominoes count:** Calculate how many dominoes are in a complete set.\n- **Probability formulation:** Use these counts to determine the probability.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n#### Strategy 1: Calculate the Number of Doubles\n\nThis seems straightforward:\n- Every number 0 through 9 can be on both sides: (0, 0), (1, 1), ..., (9, 9).\n- Hence, there are 10 doubles in total (one for each number).\n\n#### Strategy 2: Calculate Total Number of Dominoes\n\nEach number pairs with every other number, including itself, to form unique combinations:\n- For dominoes with numbers, possible combinations are (n, m) where n \u2264 m, to avoid duplication as (1, 2) and (2, 1) are the same in domino terms.\n- So we apply a combination approach without repetition for every pair from 0 to 9:\n  - Total combinations: C(n+1, 2) = C(10+1, 2) = C(11, 2).\n  \n  Calculating C(11, 2):\n  \\[\n  C(11, 2) = \\frac{11 \\times 10}{2} = 55.\n  \\]\n\n#### Strategy 3: Formulate the Probability\n\nWith counts known:\n- Total doubles: 10.\n- Total dominoes: 55.\n- Probability that a randomly selected domino is a double: \n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{Number of doubles}}{\\text{Total dominoes}} = \\frac{10}{55} = \\frac{2}{11}.\n  \\]\n\n### Reflection & Check\n\n- **Check on calculations:** C(11,2) correctly calculated as 55.\n- **Check of logic about doubles:** Yes, 10 makes sense since it involves each number pairing with itself once.\n\nEverything feels right and follows logically. Probability checks out as \\(\\frac{2}{11}\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probability that a randomly chosen domino from the set is a double is \\(\\frac{2}{11}\\). This feels right given the calculated total dominoes from combinations and the simple setup for doubles. I think I captured the thought process well, walking through understanding and calculating with checks.",

  "ground_truth": "To obtain this probability, we want to take the number of double pairings over the total number of pairings. Because each integer is paired with each other integer exactly once, we must be careful when counting how many integer pairings there are. That is, $0$ can be paired with $10$ other numbers, $1$ can be paired with $9$ other numbers (not $0$, because we've already paired $0$ and $1$), $2$ can be paired with $8$ other numbers, etc. So, there are $10 + 9 + \\ldots + 1 = 55$ pairings. Ten of these pairings are doubles ($00$, $11$, etc.). Thus, the probability of choosing a double is $\\frac{10}{55}$, which simplifies to $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{11}}$."
