    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and break it down step-by-step. \n\n### First Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see this problem, it reminds me of the compound interest formula, which I've dealt with before. I know it's typically about making an investment grow over time with some interest rate applied. Since it's a typical financial mathematics problem, I'm guessing it needs some formulas. But let's slow down and try to uncover exactly how we tackle it.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nThe investment is initially $\\$10,000$, which is expected to grow with interest. The interest applied is 6% compounded annually. We need to figure out how much money will be there at the end of 5 years. \n\nThe keyword \"compounded annually\" indicates that we'll need to use the compound interest formula:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nLooking at it, I realize since the interest is compounded annually, we can simplify the formula a bit. Here:\n- \\( P = 10,000 \\) (the principal amount)\n- \\( r = 0.06 \\) (the interest rate)\n- \\( n = 1 \\) (compounding once per year)\n- \\( t = 5 \\) (number of years)\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Formula\n\nOkay, let's plug the numbers into the formula. Since \\( n = 1 \\), the formula simplifies to:\n\n\\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ A = 10,000 \\times (1 + 0.06)^5 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Power\n\nI need to calculate \\((1 + 0.06)^5\\). Hmm, this looks like a simple power calculation.\n- First, calculate \\(1 + 0.06 = 1.06\\).\n\nNow, raising to the power of 5:\n- \\(1.06^5\\). This part can be a bit tricky mentally without a calculator. I\u2019ll write down the intermediate steps.\n\n1. \\(1.06^2 = 1.1236\\) (First multiplication)\n2. \\(1.06^3 = 1.1236 \\times 1.06 = 1.191016\\) (Careful, round only at the end)\n3. \\(1.06^4 = 1.191016 \\times 1.06 \\approx 1.262477\\)\n4. \\(1.06^5 = 1.262477 \\times 1.06 \\approx 1.338225\\)\n\nOkay, this should be correct. Always good to check once more mentally or with a calculator if possible.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Total Amount\n\nAlright, we multiply this result by the principal:\n\\[ A = 10,000 \\times 1.338225 \\]\n\\[ A = 13,382.25 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Rounding\n\nThe final step is to round \\(13,382.25\\) to the nearest whole number. So:\n- Rounding 13,382.25 gives us 13,382.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter going through these calculations, I\u2019m confident in the correctness given no arithmetic mistakes were made in manual calculations. So, the total amount in the investment after 5 years is:\n\n**$13,382**",
