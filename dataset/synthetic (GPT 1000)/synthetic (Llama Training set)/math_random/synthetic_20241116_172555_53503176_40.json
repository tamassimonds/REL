  "problem": "A map of the town that Annie, Barbara, and Charlie live in can be represented by the Cartesian plane. Annie is located at $(6,-20)$ and Barbara is located at $(1, 14)$. They agree to meet at the closest point that is equidistant from their current locations and walk upwards together to get to Charlie's location at $\\left(\\frac{7}{2}, 2\\right)$. How many units upward do Annie and Barbara walk together to get to Charlie?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's start by understanding the problem and brainstorming different strategies:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\n- We have Annie at \\((6, -20)\\) and Barbara at \\((1, 14)\\).\n- They want to meet at a point that is equidistant from both their locations.\n- From that point, they will walk upwards to meet Charlie at \\(\\left(\\frac{7}{2}, 2\\right)\\).\n- We need to determine how many units upward they walk together.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- This seems like a geometry problem on the Cartesian plane.\n- Finding a point equidistant from two different points indicates the midpoint or points on the perpendicular bisector.\n- We can use the distance formula to ensure they are equidistant to the meeting point.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Midpoint Approach:** \n    - Initially, consider the midpoint between Annie's and Barbara's locations.\n    - Midpoint Calculation: \\(\\left(\\frac{6+1}{2}, \\frac{-20+14}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{7}{2}, -3\\right)\\).\n    - Check if this point seems logically close to where they would naturally meet and if there's a straightforward path upwards to Charlie.\n\n2. **Perpendicular Bisector:**\n    - Could create an equation of the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining Annie and Barbara, given by points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\).\n    - Equation derived from vertical and horizontal midpoints and slope: \n    - Slope of \\(AB = \\frac{14-(-20)}{1-6} = \\frac{34}{-5}\\), so the perpendicular slope is \\(\\frac{5}{34}\\).\n    - Equation: \\(y - (-3) = \\frac{5}{34}(x - \\frac{7}{2})\\).\n\n**Checking the Approach:**\n\n- Midpoint seems plausible since the question stresses \"closest point.\" However, verify if equidistance from midpoint is logically deducible and if Charlie's path straight upwards provides the required distance.\n- Identify alternative checks or errors in Perpendicular Bisector Strategy if needed.\n\n**Distance to Walk Upwards:**\n\n- Compare Charlie's y-coordinate \\(y = 2\\) with the meeting y-coordinate \\(y = -3\\).\n- Calculate upward journey: \\(2 - (-3) = 5\\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- Both midpoint and upward strategy checks align logically and mathematically.\n- Considered potential alternatives and validated results with logical distance checks and arithmetic correctness.\n\nThus, Annie and Barbara walk 5 units upward to reach Charlie.",

  "ground_truth": "Annie and Barbara will be meeting up at the midpoint of $(6,-20)$ and $(1, 14)$. We only need to find the $y$-coordinate of the midpoint since the problem says they only walk upwards from the midpoint to get to Charlie's location. (If you want, you can verify that the $x$-coordinate of the midpoint equals $7/2$.) The $y$-coordinate of the midpoint is $\\frac{-20+14}{2}=-3$. To get to Charlie at $y=2$, the girls walk $2-(-3)=\\boxed{5}$ units upward."
