    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. It looks like we're dealing with a polynomial and remainders here. \n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- This problem is about polynomial remainders, which reminds me of the Remainder Theorem. The key idea is that for a polynomial \\( P(x) \\), when divided by \\( x-a \\), the remainder is \\( P(a) \\).\n- Given these conditions, I'm thinking this involves finding a remainder form or expressing \\( P(x) \\) in a specific way using the theorem.\n- What initially jumps out is that in modular arithmetic (or remainder terms), we usually model the polynomial to estimate these remainders.\n\nExploration of Strategies:\n- Well, maybe I can write the polynomial as: \\( P(x) = (x-17)Q(x) + 14 \\) and \\( P(x) = (x-13)R(x) + 6 \\).\n- This gives insight on what \\( P(17) \\) and \\( P(13) \\) would be: \\( P(17) = 14 \\), \\( P(13) = 6 \\).\n\nAttempting a Strategy:\n1. What if I model the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) in terms of a simpler form specific to the roots and remainder conditions given?\n2. Since when divided by several factors, I should try using a lower degree polynomial to check what's managed by \\( (x-17)(x-13) \\).\n\nLet's assume the remainder \\( R(x) \\) when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\((x-13)(x-17)\\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ R(x) = ax + b \\]\nThis should be a polynomial of degree less than the degree of \\((x-13)(x-17)\\), which is 2.\n\nSubstituting \\( x=17 \\) and \\( x=13 \\) into the remainder \\( R(x) \\):\n\n3. Plugging in for \\( x = 17 \\): \n   \\[\n   R(17) = 17a + b = 14\n   \\]\n\n4. Plugging in for \\( x = 13 \\): \n   \\[\n   R(13) = 13a + b = 6\n   \\]\n\n5. Now we have a system of linear equations:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{cases} \n   17a + b = 14 \\\\\n   13a + b = 6 \n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n\n6. Let's solve this system. Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   (17a + b) - (13a + b) = 14 - 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4a = 8\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a = 2\n   \\]\n\n7. Substitute \\( a = 2 \\) back into one of the original equations (I'm choosing \\( 13a + b = 6 \\)):\n   \\[\n   13(2) + b = 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   26 + b = 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   b = 6 - 26 = -20\n   \\]\n\nChecking Work:\n- So, I derived \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = -20 \\). Let me double-check this by plugging back into both equations:\n   - For \\( 17a + b = 14 \\): \\( 17(2) - 20 = 34 - 20 = 14 \\), it works.\n   - For \\( 13a + b = 6 \\): \\( 13(2) - 20 = 26 - 20 = 6 \\), it works.\n\nConclusion:\n- Okay, I\u2019m confident the remainder when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x-13)(x-17) \\) is: \n\\[\nR(x) = 2x - 20\n\\]\n\nThis solution seems to satisfy all the conditions, and it incorporates the Remainder Theorem efficiently. The systematic checking boosts confidence in accuracy\u2014solid approach, all seems good!",

  "ground_truth": "Since we are dividing by a quadratic, our remainder will have degree at most $1$. Hence the remainder is of the form $ax+b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. We have\n$$P(x) = (x-13)(x-17)Q(x) + ax+b$$where $Q(x)$ is the quotient when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x-13)(x-17)$. We can eliminate the $Q(x)$ term by plugging in $x=13$ or $x=17$. Using the Remainder Theorem, each gives us an equation:\n$$P(13) = 13a+b=6$$$$P(17) = 17a+b=14$$Solving this system gives us $a=2$ and $b=-20$, and hence the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x-13)(x-17)$ is $\\boxed{2x-20}$."
