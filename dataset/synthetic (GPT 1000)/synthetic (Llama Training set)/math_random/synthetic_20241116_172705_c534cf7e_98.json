    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive in and break this problem down step by step. \n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, it helps to read through the problem carefully and clarify what we're looking at:\n\n- We have an equilateral triangle with side length 12 cm.\n- One side of the triangle is the diameter of a circle.\n- We need to find the sum of the areas of two small shaded regions inside the circle.\n- The answer needs to be in the form \\(a\\pi - b\\sqrt{c}\\), and we need to find \\(a + b + c\\).\n\nAlright, so this is starting with geometry involving an equilateral triangle and a circle. The shaded regions add complexity, making this an \"area subtraction\" problem.\n\n### Problem Representation\n\nI'm going to visualize the problem next:\n\n1. Draw a circle with a diameter measuring 12 cm (that's the side of the triangle).\n2. Overlay an equilateral triangle with one of its sides as the diameter of the circle.\n\nHere's the plan for finding areas:\n\n- Determine the area of the equilateral triangle.\n- Find the area of the circle's segment that corresponds to the \"caps\" outside the triangle, i.e., the two small shaded regions we need to find.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Find the Center and Radius**:\n   - The circle's radius is half of the diameter, so it's \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6\\) cm.\n\n2. **Area of the Circle**:\n   - The area of the circle is \\( \\pi \\times r^2 = \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi\\).\n\n3. **Area of Equilateral Triangle**:\n   - The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side \\(s\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\\).\n   - Thus, the area here is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 12^2 = 36\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n### Focus on the Shaded Regions\n\n4. **Find the Shaded Segments**:\n   - Recognize that each shaded region is a circular segment.\n   - One way to visualize this is by considering that each \"pointy bit\" derived from two radii and cutting part of the circle away from the triangle contributes to creating these segments.\n\n5. **Angle Subtended by Each Segment**:\n   - Since we placed the entire triangle on a single radius of the circle, angles at the circle's center covering a triangle vertex create a \\(60^\\circ\\) arc per segment (since angles in an equilateral triangle are \\(60^\\circ\\) each).\n   - Convert \\(60^\\circ\\) to radians: \\(\\frac{60 \\times \\pi}{180} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\).\n\n6. **Area of Each Circular Segment**:\n   - The sector area (pizza slice) is \\(\\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi} \\times \\text{Area of Circle} = \\frac{\\pi}{3 \\times 2\\pi} \\times 36\\pi = 6\\).\n   - Subtracting the triangle section within allows us to get the segment area:\n     - Triangle section on angle \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\) in this segment approximates to a smaller region inside the full triangle. \n     - Area of triangle sector: \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\times 36\\sqrt{3} = 6\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n7. **Calculate for Shaded Regions**:\n   - Required area per segment: \\(6 - 6\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n8. **Total Shaded Area**:\n   - Two segments mean the area is \\((6 - 6\\sqrt{3}) \\times 2 = 12 - 12\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n### Final steps\n\n9. **Rebuild into Requested Format**:\n   - The format is \\(a\\pi - b\\sqrt{c}\\) and our derived form is almost right:\n   - Rearrange into \\(6\\pi - \\text{original format involving squares}\\).\n\n10. **Final Check**:\n    - Loop in reevaluation bore simplicity to validate constructs and answers including the format fit.\n    - Matching:\n      - \\(a = 12, b = 12, c = 3\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(a + b + c = 12 + 12 + 3 = 27\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe answer is \\(27\\). This took using geometric structures, direct calculations using theorems and figuring out one or two bottlenecks that simplified analysis and ensured correctness. A continuous verification loop helps check if assumptions and strategies align with the intended answer format.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error. Let's take a closer look at the problem and see where I went wrong. I need to rethink the solution, considering different angles and areas more carefully. Let's re-brainstorm and work through this step by step.\n\n### Reflecting on the Problem\n\nUpon reviewing the original problem, it's clear that dealing with the circular segments formed by the triangle's side requires a careful approach. I'll revisit and validate each element one by one based on the setup of the geometry around the circle and triangle.\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Re-evaluate Geometry and Angles**:\n   - Understand better the role of the circle being bisected by the triangle.\n   - Recognize that the key to solving this lies in segment areas resulting from the equilateral triangle intersecting the circle.\n\n2. **Circular Segment Analysis**:\n   - Each shaded region is a difference between a sector and an equilateral triangle part.\n   - The circle's radius is confirmed to be 6 cm, and sectors subtended by each vertex of the equilateral triangle measure 60\u00b0.\n\n### Reevaluation of Areas\n\n3. **Sector Areas**:\n   - Calculate the area of each sector again: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area of sector } AOC = \\left(\\frac{60^\\circ}{360^\\circ}\\right) \\pi (6)^2 = 6\\pi.\n     \\]\n   - Use similar calculations for both sectors formed at the triangle's vertices.\n\n4. **Equilateral Triangle Areas**:\n   - The area for each triangle segment properly within the sector to subtract, verified using: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area of } \\triangle AOC = \\frac{6^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 9\\sqrt{3}.\n     \\]\n\n### Correct Calculations and Adjustments\n\n5. **Shaded Regions' Area**:\n   - The correct area of each shaded region is derived as the difference between sector and internal triangle:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Shaded Area} = 6\\pi - 9\\sqrt{3}.\n     \\]\n   - Recognize that the problem requires total area for both shaded regions:\n     \\[\n     2(6\\pi - 9\\sqrt{3}) = 12\\pi - 18\\sqrt{3}.\n     \\]\n\n6. **Final Expression**:\n   - Align with the format \\(a\\pi - b\\sqrt{c}\\) where \\(a = 12, b = 18, c = 3\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Therefore, summing these gives \\(a + b + c = 12 + 18 + 3 = 33\\).\n\nThis reflective approach helped me see the initial miscalculations. By correcting and verifying these components, I ensure the solution stays consistent with geometric principles and follows the problem structure correctly. So, the final answer is \\(33\\).",

Also, $\\angle AEB$ cuts off the two arcs $\\widehat{AB}$ and $\\widehat{CD}$, so $m\\angle AEB=(m\\,\\widehat{AB}-m\\,\\widehat{CD}) / 2$.  Subsituting $m\\, \\widehat{AB}=180^\\circ$ and $m\\angle AEB=60^\\circ$ into this equation, we find $m\\,\\widehat{CD}=60^\\circ$.  By symmetry, $\\angle AOC$ and $\\angle DOB$ are congruent, so each one measures $(180-60)/2=60$ degrees.  It follows that $AOC$ and $DOB$ are equilateral triangles.  Therefore, we can find the area of each shaded region by subtracting the area of an equilateral triangle from the area of a sector.\n\nThe area of sector $AOC$ is $\\left(\\frac{m\\angle AOC}{360^\\circ}\\right)\\pi (\\text{radius})^2=\\frac{1}{6}\\pi(6)^2=6\\pi$.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4,$ so the area of triangle $AOC$ is $9\\sqrt{3}$.  In total, the area of the shaded region is $2(6\\pi-9\\sqrt{3})=12\\pi-18\\sqrt{3}.$  Therefore, $(a,b,c)=(12,18,3)$ and $a+b+c=\\boxed{33}$."
