    "working_out": "**Brainstorming:**\n\nWhen I first read the problem, it seems like a classic example of finding the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. The task is to find the smallest positive number that is a multiple of both 4 and 14. This sounds familiar because it's about finding a number that both given numbers divide evenly into.\n\nA number that is a multiple of both two distinct numbers is also their LCM. So, LCM could be a direct approach. But first, let me explore a few potential strategies to tackle this:\n\n1. Finding the multiples of 4 and 14 separately and look for the first common multiple.\n2. Using prime factorization to find the LCM of 4 and 14.\n3. Recalling any mathematical shortcut or theorem that could simplify the process.\n\n**First Approach: Listing Multiples**\n\nInitially, the simplest method here might be to just list out the multiples of 4, then list out the multiples of 14, and find the first common one. Off the top of my head:\n\n- Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, ...\n- Multiples of 14: 14, 28, 42, 56, ...\n\nUpon listing just the first few, it seems like 28 is a common multiple. But let's confirm it's the smallest.\n\n**Second Approach: Using Prime Factorization**\n\nThe more systematic way might be through prime factorization. This involves breaking down each number into its prime factors:\n\n- 4 = 2\u00b2\n- 14 = 2 \u00d7 7\n\nTo find the LCM, I need to take the highest power of each prime number from these factors. So, the LCM would include:\n\n- The highest power of 2: 2\u00b2\n- The highest power of 7: 7\u00b9\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(4, 14) = 2\u00b2 \\times 7 = 4 \\times 7 = 28 \\]\n\n**Checking My Work:**\n\nNow, I'll verify whether 28 is indeed divisible by both 4 and 14 to ensure correctness.\n\n- Divisibility by 4: \\( 28 \\div 4 = 7 \\), which is an integer.\n- Divisibility by 14: \\( 28 \\div 14 = 2 \\), again, an integer.\n\nBoth checks confirm that 28 is a multiple of both.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis process verifies that the smallest positive \\( a \\) such that \\( a \\) is a multiple of 4 and 14 is indeed 28. The LCM strategy through prime factorization headlined the approach as more efficient compared to listing multiples, especially for larger numbers.\n\nIn conclusion, through a methodical approach, I've solved the problem correctly by verifying both through computation and reasoning. The final answer is \\( a = 28 \\).",
