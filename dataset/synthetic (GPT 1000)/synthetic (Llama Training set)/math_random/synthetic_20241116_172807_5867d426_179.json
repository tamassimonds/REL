    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\(7!\\) and \\((5!)^2\\). \n\n**First Impressions and Initial Thoughts:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The GCD problem involves factorials, which means big numbers. Factorials grow very quickly, so my first thought is that the answer is probably some kind of factorization problem. \n\n2. **Initial Reactions**: Factorial problems often simplify nicely when broken down into their prime factors. So, immediately, I start thinking, \"We'll likely need to break down each factorial into primes.\"\n\n3. **Previous Experience**: This reminds me of those problems in number theory where the prime factorization tells you the greatest shared factors. So, maybe that\u2019s the direction I should take.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Calculate Each Factorial**:\n   - \\(7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\).\n   - \\((5!)^2 = (5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1)^2\\).\n\n2. **Factorization of \\(7!\\)**:\n   - \\(7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\).\n   - \\(6 = 2 \\times 3\\), \\(4 = 2^2\\), and so on.\n   - Prime factorization of \\(7!\\): \n     \\[\n     7! = 7 \\times (2 \\times 3) \\times 5 \\times (2^2) \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 7 \\times 5 \\times 3^2 \\times 2^4\n     \\]\n   - Pause for a quick check: Multiply it out or compare with a known \\(7! = 5040\\).\n\n3. **Factorization of \\((5!)^2\\)**:\n   - First, calculate \\(5!\\):  \n     \\[\n     5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5 \\times 2^2 \\times 3\n     \\]\n   - So, \\((5!)^2 = (5 \\times 2^2 \\times 3)^2 = 5^2 \\times 2^4 \\times 3^2\\).\n\n4. **Find the GCD**:\n   - Now that we have:\n     - \\(7! = 7 \\times 5 \\times 3^2 \\times 2^4\\)\n     - \\((5!)^2 = 5^2 \\times 2^4 \\times 3^2\\)\n\n   - The GCD needs the lowest power of all common primes:\n     - For 2: minimum exponent is 4, both have \\(2^4\\).\n     - For 3: minimum exponent is 2, both have \\(3^2\\).\n     - For 5: minimum exponent is 1 in \\(7!\\) and 2 in \\((5!)^2\\), so it's \\(5^1\\).\n     - 7 is not a common factor.\n\n   - Thus, the GCD is:\n     \\[\n     GCD = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 = 16 \\times 9 \\times 5\n     \\]\n\n**Now, let's do a quick sanity check on the calculations**:\n- \\(16 \\times 9 = 144\\)\n- \\(144 \\times 5 = 720\\)\n\nMy instinct was towards prime factorization, and it seems to have worked well. The reasoning appears sound, and the numbers check out. \n\nReflecting on the strategy: Though it might seem straightforward when written out, the main effort came from breaking down each step logically, checking them, and verifying with calculations. Factorization is generally a reliable method here, and it led directly to the solution. \n\nFinal answer: The greatest common divisor of \\(7!\\) and \\((5!)^2\\) is 720.",
