    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, making sure to lay out all my thoughts and processes along the way.\n\n**Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, my brain immediately thinks about the concept of base systems. I'm reminded of how numbers work differently in other bases and how we can represent the same number with a different number of digits depending on the base. \n\nThe problem states that \\(100_{10}\\) in base \\(b\\) has exactly 5 digits. So I'm thinking we are converting the decimal number 100 into a base \\(b\\) system where it results in a 5-digit number.\n\n**Starting Off**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The number 100 in decimal (base 10) is how we naturally think. But in different bases, numbers are expressed using different combinations of digits. The number having 5 digits in base \\(b\\) means that if represented as \\(d_4d_3d_2d_1d_0\\) in base \\(b\\), there must be five digits \\(d_i\\), each less than \\(b\\).\n\n2. **General Idea**: For a number \\(n\\) in base 10, when converted to a base \\(b\\), the number of digits \\(d\\) can be found by using the formula \\(d = \\lfloor \\log_b n \\rfloor + 1\\). In this case, \\(n = 100\\) and we've been told \\(d = 5\\).\n\n3. **Applying the Formula**: Given \\(5 = \\lfloor \\log_b 100 \\rfloor + 1\\), it implies \\(\\lfloor \\log_b 100 \\rfloor = 4\\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\(b\\)**: This means \\(4 \\leq \\log_b 100 < 5\\). Converting this inequality back to exponential terms, we get:\n\n   - \\(b^4 \\leq 100 < b^5\\)\n\n5. **Finding \\(b\\)**: Now my thought is to find a base \\(b\\) such that raising it to the 4th power is less than or equal to 100, and raising it to the 5th power exceeds 100. This will narrow down the possible values for \\(b\\).\n\n**Trial and Error / Numerical Estimation**\n\nI'm thinking of actual numbers that would satisfy this. Let me try small numbers:\n\n- \\(b = 3\\), then \\(b^4 = 3^4 = 81\\) and \\(b^5 = 3^5 = 243\\). \\(81 \\leq 100 < 243\\). Ok, this seems a strong candidate since 100 is between these two values.\n\n- Now, let's quickly verify with \\(b = 4\\): \\(b^4 = 4^4 = 256\\), which is already greater than 100, so \\(b = 4\\) wouldn't work.\n\n**Conclusion and Reflection**\n\nFrom this, I feel confident that \\(b = 3\\) fits the requirements because it holds true under both the conditions I set for \\(b\\). \n\nThis was a fun exploration into bases and logarithms and I think we nailed it with \\(b = 3\\). It's always satisfying when you can verify your results through both analytical methods and checking constraints directly.",

  "ground_truth": "For a base $b$ representation of $100_{10}$ to have exactly $5$ digits, the largest power of $b$ that is less than $100$ must be $4$. Therefore, we have the requirement that $b^4 \\le 100 < b^5$. We then realize that $b=3$ satisfies this requirement since $3^4 < 100 < 3^5$. We also realize that this is the only possible value of $b$ since if $b$ were equal to $2$, $b^5 = 2^5$ would be less than $100$ and if $b$ were equal to $4$, $b^4 = 4^4$ would be greater than $100$. Thus, our only solution is $b = \\boxed{3}$."
