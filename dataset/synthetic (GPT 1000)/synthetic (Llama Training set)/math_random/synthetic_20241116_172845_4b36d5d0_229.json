    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and try to understand what it's asking. We have two unknown operations represented by $\\star$ and $*$, and we need to find out what these operations are given one equation, and then use those operations in another expression.\n\nFirst, let's carefully read what we have:\n\n1. We know that $\\frac{12 \\star 2}{9 * 3} = 2$.\n2. We need to find the value of $\\frac{7 \\star 3}{12 * 6}$.\n\nOkay, I get the sense that the key step is to determine what operations $\\star$ and $*$ correspond to so that the first equation holds true. Once we decipher that, we can plug those operations into the second expression and solve it.\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing $\\frac{12 \\star 2}{9 * 3} = 2$\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\nI initially think of any operation in $\\{+, -, \\times, \\div\\}$. I think trying these out could yield a solution:\n- Let's try guessing one at a time, starting with simpler operations, maybe multiplication or addition?\n\nLet's take each potential operation for $\\star$ and $*$ and see what equation makes sense.\n\n### First Thought for $\\star$\n\n- If $\\star$ is addition, then we have $12 + 2 = 14$.\n- If $\\star$ is subtraction, we would have $12 - 2 = 10$.\n- If $\\star$ is multiplication, then $12 \\times 2 = 24$.\n- If $\\star$ is division, then $12 \\div 2 = 6$.\n\n### Now Let's Consider $*$\n\nFor each case above, calculate what $9 * 3$ could be such that the fraction simplifies correctly.\n\n#### Case: $\\star$ is addition\n\n- For $9 * 3$, divide 14 by 2 (since $\\frac{14}{\\_} = 2$ needs to hold), which gives $7$.\n- This doesn't look good; none of the basic operations $\\{+, -, \\times, \\div\\}$ made sense here.\n\n#### Case: $\\star$ is subtraction\n\n- For $9 * 3$, divide 10 by 2, which gives $5$.\n- Again, this is not fitting a standard operation.\n\n#### Case: $\\star$ is multiplication\n\n- For $9 * 3$, divide 24 by 2, yielding $12$.\n- Nah, definitely not.\n\n#### Case: $\\star$ is division\n\n- For $9 * 3$, divide 6 by 2, yielding $3$.\n- Aha! Here we go. If $9 * 3 = 3$, this implies $9 \\div 3$.\n\n### Verifying Solution\n\nLet's double-check:\n\n- If $\\star$ is division, $12 \\star 2 = 6$.\n- If $*$ is division, $9 * 3 = 3$.\n\nSo, $\\frac{12 \\div 2}{9 \\div 3} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2$. It works!\n\n## Step 2: Solving $\\frac{7 \\star 3}{12 * 6}$\n\n- With $\\star$ as division, $7 \\star 3 = 7 \\div 3 = \\frac{7}{3}$.\n- With $*$ as division, $12 * 6 = 12 \\div 6 = 2$.\n\nThus, $\\frac{7 \\star 3}{12 * 6} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{3}}{2} = \\frac{7}{6}$.\n\n### Final Check\n\n- Yeah, $\\star$ and $*$ as divisions fit all the conditions for both original and new expressions.\n\nTherefore, the value of $\\frac{7 \\star 3}{12 * 6}$ is $\\frac{7}{6}$. The gradual reasoning seems sound, and the solution checks out!",

  "ground_truth": "In the equation $\\frac{12\\star2}{9*3}=2$, the numerator of the fraction in the left hand side must be double the denominator. By trial and error, there are two ways to do this. In the first way, the $\\star$ operation is multiplication and the $*$ operation is addition, in which case the equation becomes $\\frac{12\\cdot2}{9+3}=\\frac{24}{12}=2$. Thus, the value of the given expression is $\\frac{7\\cdot3}{12+6}=\\frac{21}{18}=7/6$. In the second way, the $\\star$ operation is division and the $*$ operation is also division, in which case the equation becomes $\\frac{12/2}{9/3}=\\frac{6}{3}=2$. Thus, the value of the given expression is $\\frac{7/3}{12/6}=\\frac{7/3}{2}=7/6$, which is the same as in the first case. In either case, our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{6}}$."
