    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step and naturally work through it as if I were thinking out loud.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, I've got a problem about converting Auston's height from inches to centimeters. He\u2019s 60 inches tall and I know that 1 inch equals 2.54 cm. Immediately, I'm reminded of conversions I've done in the past \u2013 similar to converting miles to kilometers or dollars to euros. It's a straightforward multiplication problem but still worth approaching carefully.\n\n**Brainstorming Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Multiplication**: Simply multiply the number of inches by the centimeter conversion factor of 2.54. This seems like the most direct and logical strategy since it's a direct unit conversion.\n   \n2. **Incremental Conversion**: Break it down step by step, converting 10 inches at a time or even using fractions of the conversion factor to build up to 60 inches. This sounds unnecessarily complex for this straightforward task but let's keep it as an option in case something doesn't add up.\n   \n3. **Cross-Multiplication**: Set it up as a proportion (60 inches/1 = X cm/2.54 cm) and solve for X. This might complicate things unnecessarily here, but it's another way to think about unit conversions.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the direct multiplication method since it seems simplest and most direct.\n\n**Execution:**\n\n- To convert inches to centimeters using direct multiplication, I need to multiply the total inches (60) by the centimeter equivalent of one inch (2.54).\n\n\\[ \\text{Height in cm} = 60 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 2.54 \\, \\text{cm/inch} \\]\n\nLet's calculate this.\n\n- \\( 60 \\times 2.54 = 152.4 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, before I finalize this, I should double-check the multiplication to ensure no careless errors. The number 152.4 seems reasonable, but let\u2019s verify:\n\n- Breaking it down: \\( 60 \\times 2 = 120 \\) and \\( 60 \\times 0.54 = 32.4 \\); therefore, \\( 120 + 32.4 = 152.4 \\).\n  \nSo, the calculation is correct.\n\n**Checking the Approach:**\n\n- A quick reflection tells me this makes sense \u2013 if you multiply each inch by 2.54 to convert to centimeters, larger measurements proportionally grow.\n  \n- Optionally, perform a sanity check with dimensions of everyday objects recalled from memory: a ruler or similar benchmark that could serve to mentally validate that 152.4 cm seems a reasonable height.\n\n- And finally, noting how using a calculator could eliminate manual multiplication errors, reassuring the process overall is sound.\n\nThus, Auston's height in centimeters is 152.4 cm, rounded to the nearest tenth as stated \u2013 still 152.4 cm.\n\n**Closure and Satisfaction:**\n\nI\u2019m satisfied with how this went. Simple, direct execution with a couple of mind games keeping me on track. In problems like these, ensuring precision with arithmetic operations is key, and the procedure seemed spot-on. There are other methods, but for a straightforward calculation like this, keeping it simple paid off.",

  "ground_truth": "When working with unit conversion, it's easiest to think of the units as variables themselves.\n\nIn this problem, the unit we begin with is inches, and we want to end up with centimeters. Nonetheless, we don't want to change the quantity, only the units -- we must look for a ratio of units which is equal to one.\n\nSince $1 \\mbox{ inch} = 2.54 \\mbox{ cm}$, we can divide by sides by 1 inch to find  $$\\frac{2.54\\mbox{ cm}}{1\\mbox{ in}} = 1.$$\n\nSo, Auston is $$60\\mbox{ in} \\cdot \\frac{2.54 \\mbox{ cm}}{1 \\mbox{ in}} = \\boxed{152.4}\\mbox{ cm}$$ tall."
