    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think through how to find the fraction equivalent of \\(0.\\overline{73}\\). I'm going to lay out my thoughts and brainstorm a bit as I go.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nOkay, so \\(0.\\overline{73}\\) means the digits \"73\" repeat infinitely. I remember from past problems that recurring decimals often have specific methods to convert them into fractions. This looks similar to things I've done with repeating decimals, so I want to explore that method first. Hmm, I think there\u2019s something here about using algebra to solve it.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n- **Algebraic method**: This is the one I most commonly use with repeating decimals.\n- **Guess and check**: Doesn't really apply here since we need an exact fraction.\n- **Convert to an infinite series**: Could work, but less straightforward than algebra.\n\n### Let's Start with Algebraic Method\n1. **Define a variable**: Let \\( x = 0.\\overline{73} \\). This is our starting point.\n\n2. **Multiply to shift the decimal**: Since \"73\" repeats every two digits, multiply both sides by 100 (because of our repeating two-digit cycle).\n    \\[\n    100x = 73.737373\\ldots\n    \\]\n    This matches the repeating nature of the decimal.\n\n3. **Set up an equation**: Now, if we subtract the original \\( x = 0.737373\\ldots \\) from this equation, the repeating parts should cancel out.\n    \\[\n    100x - x = 73.737373\\ldots - 0.737373\\ldots\n    \\]\n\n4. **Perform the subtraction**:\n    \\[\n    99x = 73\n    \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\)**: Now divide both sides by 99 to solve for \\( x \\).\n    \\[\n    x = \\frac{73}{99}\n    \\]\n    Okay, this should be our fraction. \n\n### Checking My Work\n- **Does it feel right?**: The algebra should correctly handle converting repeating decimals into fractions. \n- **Simplification Check**: Is \\(\\frac{73}{99}\\) in simplest form? \n    - I don't immediately see any common factors between 73 and 99 beyond 1, making it likely already simplest.\n    - A quick mental check shows 73 is a prime number.\n\n### Aha Moment and Reflection\nOh, subtracting those two equations led us directly to the fraction, and it didn't need further simplification! This aligns with how rational numbers and repeating decimals connect \u2014 a finite number from infinite repetition.\n\nReflecting on my approach, using algebra was straightforward, avoided complex patterns or series, and directly got the result. Any deeper insights? This highlights how recurring patterns can be captured finitely, a neat aspect of number theory.\n\n### Conclusion\nGreat, \\(0.\\overline{73}\\) converts to the fraction \\(\\frac{73}{99}\\). Double-checked, and everything looks correct logically and procedurally. \n\nThese steps show the algebraic tackling of a repeating decimal, confirming not just an answer but understanding the method's strength.",
