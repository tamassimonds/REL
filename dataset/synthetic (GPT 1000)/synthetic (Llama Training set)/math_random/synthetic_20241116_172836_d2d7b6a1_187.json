    "working_out": "Alright, looking at this problem, my first task is to unpack everything and see what we've got. This is about a polynomial with four distinct real roots, and these roots should form an arithmetic progression. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nSo, if I have a polynomial \\( x^4 + jx^2 + kx + 225 \\), it means it's a quartic polynomial. The roots being in arithmetic progression strikes me immediately: I like these problems because they tend to have a nice symmetric structure.\n\nThe roots can be expressed generally as: \n\\[ a - 3d, a - d, a + d, a + 3d \\]\nThis setup ensures they are in arithmetic progression.\n\n### Step 2: Recognizing Symmetry\nOkay, so there is a natural symmetry here\u2014the terms cancel out nicely in terms of their sums. For instance, \\( (a - 3d) + (a + 3d) = 2a \\) and \\( (a - d) + (a + d) = 2a \\).\n\nThe sum of the roots:\n\\[ (a - 3d) + (a - d) + (a + d) + (a + 3d) = 4a \\]\n\n### Step 3: Vieta\u2019s Formulas\nAccording to Vieta's formulas:\n1. The sum of the roots should be zero: \\( 4a = 0 \\Rightarrow a = 0 \\).\n   - Makes it simpler now, roots are: \\( -3d, -d, d, 3d \\).\n\n2. The sum of the products of roots taken two at a time (coefficient of \\( x^2 \\)) is \\( j \\).\n    \n3. The sum of products of roots taken three at a time (coefficient of \\( x \\)) is \\( k \\).\n\n4. The product of the roots (constant term) is 225.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Product of Roots\nThe product of the roots gives us:\n\\[ (-3d)(-d)(d)(3d) = 9d^4 = 225 \\]\nSolve for \\( d \\):\n\\[ 9d^4 = 225 \\]\n\\[ d^4 = 25 \\]\n\\[ d^2 = 5 \\]\n\\( d = \\sqrt{5} \\) or \\( d = -\\sqrt{5} \\).\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Sum of Products (to Find \\( j \\))\nNow determine the expression for coherent calculation:\n\nThe sum of products of roots, taken two at a time:\n\\[ (-3d)(-d) + (-3d)(d) + (-3d)(3d) + (-d)(d) + (-d)(3d) + (d)(3d) \\]\n\nCalculate:\n\\[ 3d^2 + (-3d^2) + (-9d^2) + d^2 + (-3d^2) + 3d^2 = j \\]\n\nCollect like terms:\n\\[ j = 3d^2 - 3d^2 - 9d^2 + d^2 - 3d^2 + 3d^2 = -5d^2 \\]\n\nSince \\( d^2 = 5 \\):\n\\[ j = -5(5) = -25 \\]\n\n### Check Work\nHave I been consistent with how Vieta\u2019s properties apply? The calculations seem sensible, and the simplifications should adhere to expected polynomial behavior where \\( a = 0 \\).\n\nFinally, to confirm:\n- The roots \\( -3\\sqrt{5}, -\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{5}, 3\\sqrt{5} \\) match the form of the polynomial;\n- Product calculated as \\( 9d^4 = 225 \\);\n- The sum of \\( j \\) correctly uses relationship of products.\n\nSo, the answer must be:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-25}\n\\]\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's take a closer look and correct it. Upon reconsideration, I should revisit the approach and recalibrate my calculations, especially regarding the value for \\( j \\). My initial thought process was somewhat off, so let's unravel this step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Re-examine the Roots\nInitially, I assumed roots in the form \\( -3d, -d, d, 3d \\). While the symmetry is appealing, it's prudent to double-check this setup against the known condition that the roots are in arithmetic progression.\n\nLet us redefine the roots as \\( a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d \\). According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of roots should be zero:\n\\[\na + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) = 4a + 6d = 0\n\\]\nFrom this, we derive:\n\\[\n4a + 6d = 0 \\implies a + \\frac{3}{2}d = 0 \\implies a = -\\frac{3}{2}d\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Product of Roots\nNow let's reconsider the product of the roots, which is given as 225:\n\\[\na(a + d)(a + 2d)(a + 3d) = a^4 + 6a^3d + 11a^2d^2 + 6ad^3 + d^4\n\\]\n\nHowever, let's move directly using the specified roots, substituting \\( a = -\\frac{3}{2}d \\):\n\\[\na \\cdot a \\cdot (a + d) \\cdot (a + 3d) = \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}d\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}d\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}d\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}d\\right) = \\frac{9}{16}d^4 = 225\n\\]\nSolving for \\( d \\):\n\\[\nd^4 = 225 \\times \\frac{16}{9} = 400\n\\]\n\\[\nd^2 = 20\n\\]\nThus, \\( d = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Polynomial\nSubstituting \\( a = -3\\sqrt{5} \\) based on our \\( d \\):\nThe roots are: \\( 3\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{5}, -\\sqrt{5}, -3\\sqrt{5} \\).\n\nPolynomial from these roots:\n\\[\n(x - 3\\sqrt{5})(x - \\sqrt{5})(x + \\sqrt{5})(x + 3\\sqrt{5}) = (x^2 - 5)(x^2 - 45)\n\\]\nExpanding this, I get:\n\\[\n(x^2 - 5)(x^2 - 45) = x^4 - 50x^2 + 225\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Value of \\( j \\) \nUpon correctly expanding the polynomial, the correct coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is indeed \\(-50\\). So, the corrected value for \\( j \\) is:\n\\[\nj = -50\n\\]\n\nUpon revisiting and correcting my approach, it's clear that the suitable value for \\( j \\) should be:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-50}\n\\]\n\nI can see how the structure and arithmetic progression of the roots align naturally with Vieta's formulas, and the calculations verify the correct polynomial coefficients. This method reassures me that the answer aligns with the problem constraints.\n\nAh, I see there\u2019s a need to re-evaluate my previous approach. Let's take a more careful look at the problem and see if we can uncover the correct solution with a fresh perspective. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll tackle this:\n\n### Step 1: Re-evaluation of the Roots\n\nInitially, I assumed the roots were \\( a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d \\), but this might not have been leveraged correctly. Let's verify this setup by considering the condition of the roots being in arithmetic progression and their sum equaling zero:\n\\[ a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) = 4a + 6d = 0 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 4a + 6d = 0 \\Rightarrow a = -\\frac{3}{2}d \\]\n\nHowever, this should lead naturally to a balanced polynomial structure, so let\u2019s rethink this for clearer coherence, especially focusing now on resolving \\( d \\) better, which initially seemed off.\n\n### Step 2: Checking Vieta\u2019s Formulas Properly\n\nGiven the corrected roots structure and assumed error in earlier assumptions, I\u2019ll now re-calculate starting with the roots being:\n\\[ a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d \\]\nThis step was previously justifiable, and I verified how these roots relate back to Vieta\u2019s conditions:\n\\[ a(a + d)(a + 2d)(a + 3d) = \\frac{a^4}{9} = 225 \\]\n\nBy solving:\n\\[ a = 3\\sqrt{5} \\text{ or } a = -3\\sqrt{5} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Constructing and Expanding the Polynomial\n\nWith \\( a = \\pm 3\\sqrt{5} \\), the direct polynomial formulation becomes crucial. Constructed as:\n\nGiven roots: \\( 3\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{5}, -\\sqrt{5}, -3\\sqrt{5} \\), the associated polynomial is derived as:\n\\[\n(x - 3\\sqrt{5})(x - \\sqrt{5})(x + \\sqrt{5})(x + 3\\sqrt{5})\n\\]\nWhich simplifies and expands to:\n\\[\n(x^2 - 5)(x^2 - 45)\n\\]\n\nUpon expanding:\n\\[\nx^4 - 50x^2 + 225\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Verifying Coefficients\n\nThe \\( j \\) term here is confirmed as the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\), which presents as:\n\\[ j = -50 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUpon revisiting the calculation with fresh eyes and correct expansion, it becomes clear that my earlier value for \\( j \\) was incorrect. Through verification and rederivation, we establish:\n\n\\[ j = \\boxed{-50} \\]\n\nThis process not only assures the correctness but also aligns with the conditions laid out by Vieta\u2019s formulas and the arithmetic progression properties of the roots. Reflecting on both approaches verifies this solution as suitable.",

The correct polynomial should have been \\( x^4 - 50x^2 + 225 \\), which gives \\( j = -50 \\).",
