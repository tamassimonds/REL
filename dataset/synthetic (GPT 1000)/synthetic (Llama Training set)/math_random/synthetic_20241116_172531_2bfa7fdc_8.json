    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem of finding the largest perfect square factor of 1512. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nHmm, the problem is asking for the largest perfect square factor. Perfect squares are numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, etc., which are squares of integers. To find the largest one that factors into 1512, I might need to break down 1512 into its prime factors first. \n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   When I think of perfect square factors, I remember they are products of pairs of prime factors. So, I need to figure out the prime factorization of 1512.\n\n2. **Strategy Brainstorm:**\n   Let's consider strategies:\n   - Factor 1512 down to its prime components.\n   - Identify factor pairs that can form perfect squares.\n   - Alternatively, I could estimate square roots and check divisibility, but that feels inefficient given the size of this number.\n\n3. **Prime Factorization:**\n   Alright, let's start by dividing by the smallest prime number:\n\n   \\(1512\\) is even, so it's divisible by 2.\n   \\[\n   1512 \\div 2 = 756\n   \\]\n\n   756 is also even:\n   \\[\n   756 \\div 2 = 378\n   \\]\n\n   378 is again even:\n   \\[\n   378 \\div 2 = 189\n   \\]\n\n   Now, 189 is odd. Let's try dividing by 3:\n   \\[\n   189 \\div 3 = 63\n   \\]\n\n   63 is divisible by 3:\n   \\[\n   63 \\div 3 = 21\n   \\]\n\n   21 is also divisible by 3:\n   \\[\n   21 \\div 3 = 7\n   \\]\n\n   Finally, 7 is a prime number, so we're done:\n   \\[\n   1512 = 2^3 \\times 3^3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n   Let's just double-check: \n   - \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n   - \\(3^3 = 27\\)\n   - \\(8 \\times 27 = 216\\)\n   - \\(216 \\times 7 = 1512\\)\n\n   Cool, the prime factorization seems correct.\n\n4. **Building Perfect Square Factors:**\n   A perfect square factor will be formed by using powers of primes that are even.\n   - For \\(2^3\\), the largest even exponent is \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n   - For \\(3^3\\), the largest even exponent is \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n   - For \\(7^1\\), we can't use it in a perfect square.\n\n   So, the largest perfect square factor is \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 = 4 \\times 9 = 36\\).\n\n5. **Verify:**\n   Let's just check all this one last time:\n   - Check calculations for \\(2\\)s, \\(3\\)s, and skip the \\(7\\) since odd exponent.\n   - Multiply \\(4 \\times 9\\) again, got 36.\n   - Quick reflection: I covered all factors, confirmed that they form the largest perfect square.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe largest perfect square factor of 1512 is 36. \n\nReflecting on this process, it feels thorough and fits with all the checks and approaches I've considered. If I had chosen a wrong prime factor or missed a step, my double-check approach would have caught it. The breaking down into a prime factorization was the right path.",

  "ground_truth": "Let's find the prime factorization of 1512: $1512=2^3\\cdot189=2^3\\cdot3^3\\cdot7$. The only two squares of primes that divide 1512 are $2^2=4$ and $3^2=9$. Therefore, the largest perfect square factor of 1512 is $2^2\\cdot3^2=(2\\cdot3)^2=\\boxed{36}$."
