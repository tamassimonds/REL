    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem! I'll start by trying to make sense of the information given and brainstorm possible approaches.\n\n### First Thoughts:\n- **Translate the words into math:** The rectangular field is half as wide as it is long. My initial thought is to set up some variables for the dimensions. Let's say the length is \\( L \\) and the width is half of that, or \\( \\frac{L}{2} \\).\n- **Perimeter information:** The total fencing is 54 meters, which tells us about the perimeter of the rectangle. Since the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by \\( 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width}) \\), I can use this to form an equation.\n- **Relate it to area:** Eventually, I need to find the area, which is simply \\( \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Establish the equation for the perimeter:**\n   - Given the perimeter is 54 meters, the equation would be:\n     \\[\n     2(L + \\frac{L}{2}) = 54\n     \\]\n\n2. **Simplify and solve for \\( L \\):**\n   - Simplify inside the parentheses:\n     \\[\n     L + \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{2L}{2} + \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{3L}{2}\n     \\]\n\n   - So the equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times \\frac{3L}{2} = 54\n     \\]\n\n   - Cancel out the 2's:\n     \\[\n     3L = 54\n     \\]\n\n   - Solve for \\( L \\) by dividing both sides by 3:\n     \\[\n     L = \\frac{54}{3} = 18\n     \\]\n\n3. **Use \\( L \\) to find the width:**\n   - The width \\( W \\) is half of the length:\n     \\[\n     W = \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the field:**\n   - Using the length and width to find the area:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = L \\times W = 18 \\times 9 = 162\n     \\]\n\n5. **Reflect and verify:**\n   - Quick check with the perimeter calculation:\n     \\[\n     2(L + W) = 2(18 + 9) = 2 \\times 27 = 54\n     \\]\n   - The perimeter we calculated matches the problem statement, ensuring our dimensions are correct.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter setting up the variables and solving the equations, the calculations lead us to the area of the field. The number of square meters in the area of the field is \\(\\boxed{162}\\).\n\nI feel confident with this solution after verifying the dimensions and recalculating the perimeter, ensuring all steps align with the problem description. I love how breaking it down step by step made the task easily manageable!",

  "ground_truth": "Let the rectangle's width be $w$, then its length is $2w$.  So its perimeter is $2(w + 2w) = 6w = 54$.  Thus $w = 9$, and the rectangle's area is $9(2\\cdot 9) = \\boxed{162}$ square meters."
