    "working_out": "When I first see the sequence 1,000,000; 500,000; 250,000... my immediate thought is, \"This sequence looks like it's halving each time.\" It's a pattern I've encountered before in exponential decay problems or geometric sequences. My goal here seems to be finding the last integer in this sequence, which requires understanding when the sequence stops being an integer.\n\nOkay, let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Identifying the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence given is 1,000,000; 500,000; 250,000...\n   - This clearly shows each term is the previous term divided by 2. It looks like a classic geometric sequence where each term is half of the previous one. Let's write this out as a formula to articulate the sequence:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{a_{n-1}}{2}\n   \\]\n   So, each term \\(a_n\\) is derived by halving the previous term \\(a_{n-1}\\).\n\n2. **Determine the Specific Task:**\n   - I need to find the last integer in this sequence.\n   - A sequence like this will eventually become a fraction (a decimal value) since powers of 2 will exceed the value contained in the sequence's terms. Basically, when the number becomes less than 1, that's when integer representation stops.\n\n3. **Exploring the Sequence:**\n   - Starting from 1,000,000, it's helpful to continue calculating this sequence to better see when it might stop being an integer.\n     \\[\n     a_1 = 1,000,000\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a_2 = 500,000\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a_3 = 250,000\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a_4 = 125,000\n     \\]\n     - Let's continue this process quickly until something clicks or a pattern becomes evident.\n\n4. **Realizing a New Strategy Might Be Beneficial:**\n   - Instead of calculating forever, let's determine the power of 2 within 1,000,000. By prime factorization, I'll know when we'll stop getting whole numbers because the result could clearly tell when we stop having integers. Oof, okay, this problem is a bit of a bear\u2014\n     - Examine the prime factorization of 1,000,000.\n\n5. **Factorize 1,000,000:**\n   - Alright, let's break down 1,000,000 to its prime factors. Recognize the obviously multiple of 10, it ends with that many zeroes:\n     \\[\n     1,000,000 = 10^6 = (2 \\times 5)^6 = 2^6 \\times 5^6\n     \\]\n     - Clearly, the division by 2 will exhaust when \\(2^6\\) runs out. I need to keep dividing by 2 until no 2's left to divide by.\n\n6. **Power Control:**\n   - The power of 2 is 6 in the factorization of 1,000,000.\n   - Therefore, after dividing six times, the next division will not yield an integer since we're left with \\(5^6\\) and no twos to divide by. Calculate those few special terms:\n\n7. **Final Calculations:**\n   - Calculating:\n     \\[\n     a_5 = \\frac{125,000}{2} = 62,500\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a_6 = \\frac{62,500}{2} = 31,250\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a_7 = \\frac{31,250}{2} = 15,625\n     \\]\n   - This seventh term, 15,625, is derived solely from \\(5^6\\) and is still an integer, as extending goes to infinity inherently for repeating divisions that eventually become fractions.\n\n8. **Final Reflection:**\n   - Now the integers stem purely through the power of 5 in factorization \u2014 good! This makes 15,625 our last integer result within the constraints of division by 2, reaching upon six measurable applications.\n\nAnd onwards: 15,625 is the last integer term in this sequence. Done! Understanding the factors led the way to precision without extending unnecessary calculations endlessly.",

  "ground_truth": "Repeatedly dividing by 2, we find the next terms in the sequence to be 125000, 62500, 31250, 15625,... 15625 is no longer a multiple of 2, so when we divide by 2 again, we will not get an integer, nor will it be a multiple of 2. Thus, no number in the sequence after 15625 can be an integer. Thus, our answer is $\\boxed{15625}$."
