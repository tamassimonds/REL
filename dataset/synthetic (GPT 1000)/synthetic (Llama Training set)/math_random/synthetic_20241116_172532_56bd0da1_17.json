    "working_out": "First thoughts:\n\nOkay, let's take a moment to understand the problem. We're dealing with the second hand of a clock. The second hand is 6 cm long, and the task is to determine how far the tip travels in 30 minutes, expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\).\n\nThis kind of problem feels familiar, like it's touching on concepts of circles and perhaps rotations. The second hand completing full rotations around the clock face is probably key to figuring this out.\n\nBrainstorming:\n\n1. **Rotational Movement:** I remember that the path traced by a rotating object is a circle. So, the path of the second hand's tip is a circular path.\n\n2. **Distance Traveled in Terms of Circumference:** The distance that a point on the perimeter of the circle (like the tip of the second hand) travels in one full rotation is the circumference of the circle.\n\n3. **Finding Circumference:** I need to calculate the circumference of the circle formed by the path of the second-hand tip. The formula for circumference \\( C \\) is \\( 2\\pi \\times \\text{radius} \\).\n\n4. **Second Hand as Radius:** Here, the second hand is the radius of the circle, and that's given as 6 cm. So, the circumference \\( C \\) will be \\( 2\\pi \\times 6 = 12\\pi \\) cm.\n\nChecking so far:\n\nQuick check of the circumference calculation makes sense. The second hand makes a circle of 6 cm radius, so \\( 2\\pi \\times 6 = 12\\pi \\) cm is accurate for the full distance of one rotation.\n\nIf something feels off:\n\nHow many rotations does the second hand complete in 30 minutes? Each full minute, the hand moves once completely around the clock. So, over 30 minutes...\n\n5. **Calculating Rotations in 30 Minutes:** The second hand completes one full rotation every 60 seconds (or 1 minute). Therefore, in 30 minutes, it will complete 30 rotations.\n\n6. **Total Distance Traveled:** If each rotation covers a distance of \\( 12\\pi \\) cm, then in 30 rotations, the total distance is \\( 30 \\times 12\\pi \\).\n\nNow let's calculate that:\n\n\\[ 30 \\times 12\\pi = 360\\pi \\, \\text{cm}. \\]\n\nFinal reflections:\n\nThis feels correct because with each rotation covering \\( 12\\pi \\) cm, multiplying by 30 for each minute seems logically sound. The approach checks out with the typical logic applied to circular movements. \n\nEnding thoughts:\n\nI've taken into account individual rotation distances and the full sum for those rotations over time. After careful consideration and brief checks at each step, the total distance is \\( 360\\pi \\) cm.\n\nThat seems coherent, given the constraints and details of the problem. Thus, the answer is:\n\n**\\( 360\\pi \\, \\text{cm} \\).**",

  "ground_truth": "In 30 minutes, the tip of the second hand travels 30 times around the circumference of a circle of radius 6cm. Since the circumference is $2\\pi \\cdot6 = 12\\pi$, the tip of the second hand travels $12\\pi \\cdot 30 = \\boxed{360\\pi}$ centimeters."
