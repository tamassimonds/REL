    "working_out": "Alright, let's take a look at this interesting problem involving a quadratic equation. To start, I want to understand the properties of the graph given in the problem. So here's my first thought process:\n\n1. **Understand the Given Information**\n   - We have a quadratic equation \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n   - The maximum value of this quadratic is 5, which happens at \\( x = 3 \\).\n   - The graph passes through the point \\((0, -13)\\).\n   - We need to find the value of \\( m \\) when the graph passes through the point \\((4, m)\\).\n\n2. **Identify Key Features of Quadratic**\n   - A quadratic function can be written in standard form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) or vertex form \\( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \\).\n   - Since the maximum value is given, and it occurs at a specific \\(x\\), using the vertex form might make it easier because the maximum value is \\(k\\) when \\( a < 0 \\).\n\n3. **Express in Vertex Form**\n   - The vertex form is \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\).\n   - Given that the maximum value is 5 at \\( x = 3 \\), we can say the vertex is \\((3, 5)\\).\n   - Therefore, the function is \\( y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5 \\).\n\n4. **Analyze the Conditions**\n   - The point \\((0, -13)\\) means that when \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = -13 \\).\n\n5. **Substitute Point into Vertex Form**\n   \\[\n   -13 = a(0 - 3)^2 + 5\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   -13 = 9a + 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -18 = 9a\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a = -2\n   \\]\n\n   Now the equation is fully formed as:\n   \\[\n   y = -2(x - 3)^2 + 5\n   \\]\n\n6. **Check If This Makes Sense**\n   - Plugging \\( x = 3 \\) into \\( y = -2(x - 3)^2 + 5 \\) should give the vertex, so:\n   \\[\n   y = -2(3 - 3)^2 + 5 = 5\n   \\]\n   That matches, confirming the maximum value at \\(x = 3\\) is indeed 5.\n\n7. **Find the Value of \\( m \\)**\n   - Now substitute \\( x = 4 \\) into \\( y = -2(x - 3)^2 + 5 \\) to find \\( m \\):\n   \\[\n   m = -2(4 - 3)^2 + 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   m = -2(1)^2 + 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   m = -2 + 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   m = 3\n   \\]\n\n8. **Reflect on the Steps**\n   - My calculations seem consistent with the problem conditions. The quadratic equation construction in vertex form simplifies the application of given conditions.\n   - Each step logically transitions to the next, and I verified maximum and point substitution consistency.\n\n9. **Conclusion**\n   - The value of \\( m \\) when the graph passes through \\( (4, m) \\) is \\( \\boxed{3} \\).\n\nThis approach, using the quadratic's vertex form and verifying through substitution, seems trustworthy!",

  "ground_truth": "Since the maximum value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is 5, which occurs at $x = 3$, this tells us that the vertex of the parabola is $(3,5)$.  Hence, the quadratic is of the form $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5$, where $a$ is a negative number.  (We know that $a$ is negative because $y$ has a maximum value.)\n\nWe are also told that the graph passes through the point $(0,-13)$.  Substituting these coordinates into the equation $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5$, we get $-13 = 9a + 5$, so $a = (-5 - 13)/9 = -18/9 = -2$.  Therefore, the equation is $y =- 2(x - 3)^2+5$.\n\nWhen $x = 4$, we have $m = - 2 \\cdot 1^2 + 5 = \\boxed{3}$."
