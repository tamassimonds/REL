    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step.\n\n### First Impressions:\n\nThe given problem is related to vectors and their magnitudes. I've encountered problems related to vector magnitudes before, so this seems familiar. The notation \\(\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|\\) typically represents the magnitude or norm of the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). Okay, that part is clear. We need to find \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\), which is the dot product of vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) with itself. I remember that there\u2019s a connection between a vector's magnitude and its dot product with itself. Let's explore this step by step.\n\n### Exploring Strategies:\n\n1. **Understanding Norm and Dot Product:** \n   - The magnitude (or length) of a vector \\(\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|\\) is given by the square root of the dot product of the vector with itself: \\(\\|\\mathbf{v}\\| = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}\\). This is critical because it gives us a direct relationship between the norm and the dot product.\n   - Writing it down might clarify things:    \n     \\[\n     \\|\\mathbf{v}\\| = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}\n     \\]  \n\n2. **Given Information and Substitution:**\n   - We have \\(\\|\\mathbf{v}\\| = 4\\). Let's substitute this into the equation above:  \n     \\[\n     4 = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}\n     \\]  \n\n3. **Solving for the Dot Product:**\n   - To isolate \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\), we can square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n   - Squaring 4 gives us:  \n     \\[\n     16 = \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - Does this answer make intuitive sense? Yes, because when you square the magnitude of a vector, you should get the dot product of the vector with itself, which is \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\). If I plug back \\(\\sqrt{16}\\), it results in 4, which is consistent with the given magnitude.\n\n### Reflection and Conclusion:\n\nIt seems the steps I followed correctly match the definition and properties of vector norms and dot products. The answer aligns with my expectation from theory, and the simple substitution and squaring didn't show apparent errors. At any rate, it's wise to feel good about a solution only after confirming that all logical steps align well!\n\nHence, the dot product \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\) is \\(\\boxed{16}\\).",
