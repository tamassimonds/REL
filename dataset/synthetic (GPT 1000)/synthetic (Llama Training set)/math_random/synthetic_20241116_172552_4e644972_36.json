    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n\n- Okay, this problem sounds like it\u2019s about probability. Molly flips a coin five times, and she gets heads each time. Now, she wants to know the probability of getting a tail on her next flip. My first thought is that this seems straightforward because a coin flip is supposed to be independent of previous flips, but let's take it step by step.\n  \n- A coin has two sides: heads (H) and tails (T). The probability of any one side coming up on a fair coin is 1/2. This seems simple, but maybe there\u2019s more to it? Let\u2019s explore.\n\nInitial Exploration:\n\n- I'm thinking about the nature of independent events. In probability, if two events are independent, the outcome of one doesn't affect the other. Coin flips are classic examples of independent events.\n  \n- Does the fact that Molly got heads five times change the nature of the coin or the probability for the next flip? My gut says no, but let's justify this.\n\n- Oh! This reminds me of topics like the \"Gambler's Fallacy\" where people think past events influence future independent events, but they actually don't. Each flip is brand new! \n\nStep-by-step Approach:\n\n1. **Identify the scenario**:\n   - We\u2019re dealing with a fair coin, which means the chance for heads or tails is equal.\n   - For any single flip, the probability of getting heads (H) is 1/2, and the probability of getting tails (T) is also 1/2.\n\n2. **Consider the past events**:\n   - Molly flipped heads five times. This sequence is indeed surprising, but it doesn't change the nature of the coin for future flips.\n\n3. **Evaluate the current flip**:\n   - For the sixth flip, what is the probability of getting tails? Since each flip is independent, the result of the sixth flip does not depend on the previous five flips.\n\n4. **Apply the definition of an independent event**:\n   - Each coin toss is independent. Therefore, the probability that Molly flips a tail on her next try is still simply 1/2.\n  \n5. **Check and reflect**:\n   - Let\u2019s see if this logically holds up. The five consecutive heads don\u2019t alter future probabilities. \n\n6. **Final thoughts**:\n   - It looks like I haven\u2019t missed out on any part of the problem where past results would affect future outcomes in this specific setup. Thus, the probability remains 1/2.\n  \nConclusion:\n\n- After walking through my thought process, I\u2019m confident the solution aligns with the principles of probability and the nature of independent events. \n\n- The probability that Molly will flip a tail on her next flip is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nBy thoroughly thinking through it, it asserts my original assumption about independent events and aligns with the core understanding of probability theory regarding independent events.",

  "ground_truth": "This problem refers to the property of coins and other trial-independent probability devices that we refer to as not having memory. In other words, the coin cannot respond in any way to how it landed on the previous 5 flips. It is still equally likely to be heads or tails on its next flip, so the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
