    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: \"If the three points \\((1,a,b), (a,2,b), (a,b,3)\\) are collinear, what is the value of \\(a + b\\)?\"\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the problem**\n\nOkay, collinearity of points means that the points lie on the same straight line. For three points in three-dimensional space to be collinear, the direction vectors between two pairs of these points must be scalar multiples of each other. A typical approach could involve finding such vectors and seeing how they relate.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- At first glance, I'm thinking about the conditions for collinearity in three dimensions. Generally, if three points are collinear, then the vector between any two pairs of points should be parallel.\n- In this context, it means that two vectors formed from these points should be scalar multiples of each other.\n\n**Step 2: Define the vectors**\n\nLet\u2019s start by identifying vectors between points:\n- Vector \\( \\mathbf{v_1} = (a-1, 2-a, 0) \\) represents the direction from \\((1, a, b)\\) to \\((a, 2, b)\\).\n- Vector \\( \\mathbf{v_2} = (0, b-2, 3-b) \\) represents the direction from \\((a, 2, b)\\) to \\((a, b, 3)\\).\n\n**Step 3: Check parallelism condition**\n\nFor these vectors to be parallel, there needs to exist a scalar \\( k \\) such that \\( \\mathbf{v_1} = k \\cdot \\mathbf{v_2} \\).\n\nBreaking that equation into component-wise relationships:\n\\[ \na - 1 = k \\cdot 0, \\quad 2 - a = k(b - 2), \\quad 0 = k(3 - b) \n\\]\n\nThe first equation \\( a - 1 = 0 \\cdot k \\) directly tells us nothing as \\( 0 \\cdot k\\) is trivially zero regardless of \\( k \\).\n\nThe third equation, \\(0 = k(3-b)\\), implies either \\( k = 0 \\) or \\( b = 3 \\).\n\n**Checking possibilities:**\n\n- **If \\( k = 0 \\),** which makes \\(\\mathbf{v_1}\\) zero but contradicts the need for distinct point coordinates unless fully overlapped (and thus degenerate collinearity). This generally wouldn't make sense as these vectors need to reflect real lines.\n  \n- **If \\( b = 3 \\),** substitute into the other parallel condition:\n  \\[\n  2 - a = k(3 - 2) = k \\cdot 1 = k\n  \\]\n  Thus, \\( k = 2 - a \\).\n\nSince we've already taken \\( b = 3 \\), substitute back:\n- Now, ensure all initial points are confirmed distinct within conditions since these corrections simplify to fit collinearity.\n\n**Verification:**\n- Setting \\( b = 3, a = 1 \\): both equal roots confirm absolute collinearity.\n- As vectors reduce with these consistent and clean substitutions confirming conditions: they reliably set \\(k = 1\\) as a natural finite (non-zero) scalar.\n\nThus, if \\( b = 3 \\) and substituting back \\( a = 1 \\), which matches symmetry in constructed vectors. Calculations align.\n\nTherefore, we should have:\n\\[ \na + b = 1 + 3 = 4 \n\\]\n\nAnd indeed, substituting values back from calculated roots confirms \\((a,b) = (1,3)\\) resolves into the single collinear span.\n\n**Final answer:** \\( a + b = 4 \\)",
