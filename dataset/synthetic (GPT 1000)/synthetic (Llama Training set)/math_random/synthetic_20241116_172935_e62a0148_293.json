    "working_out": "Alright, let's start exploring and understanding this problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst, the problem mentions a \"27-inch\" television screen, which refers to the diagonal measurement of the screen. Additionally, the screen follows a \"4:3\" aspect ratio. This means that for every 4 units of horizontal length, there are 3 units of height.\n\nMy initial thought is that this seems like a classic right triangle problem. The screen dimensions form a right triangle, with the horizontal length and height as the legs, and the diagonal as the hypotenuse.\n\n**Step 2: Setting Up the Problem**\n\nGiven the aspect ratio 4:3, let's denote the horizontal length by `4x` and the height by `3x`. This keeps the ratio intact while introducing a variable `x` to represent any common factor.\n\nWe have:\n- Horizontal length: \\( 4x \\)\n- Height: \\( 3x \\)\n\nThe diagonal of the screen is 27 inches. Hence, right away, I\u2019m reminded of the Pythagorean theorem because we're dealing with a right triangle.\n\n**Step 3: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n\\[\n(4x)^2 + (3x)^2 = 27^2\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation step by step.\n\n**Step 4: Solving the Equation**\n\nLet's compute each term:\n- \\((4x)^2 = 16x^2\\)\n- \\((3x)^2 = 9x^2\\)\n\nThus, combining terms:\n\\[\n16x^2 + 9x^2 = 27^2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n25x^2 = 729\n\\]\n\nNext, we'll solve for \\(x^2\\):\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{729}{25}\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides to solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{\\sqrt{729}}{\\sqrt{25}} = \\frac{27}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Finding the Horizontal Length**\n\nNow that we have \\(x\\), let's find the horizontal length:\n\\[\n\\text{Horizontal length} = 4x = 4 \\times \\frac{27}{5} = \\frac{108}{5} = 21.6 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n**Step 6: Double-Checking My Work**\n\nLet me pause and just go over the logic again to ensure everything aligns:\n\n- Defined 4x and 3x based on the aspect ratio.\n- Used Pythagorean theorem to establish the relationship, which checks out as it\u2019s a right triangle.\n- Calculated \\(x = \\frac{27}{5}\\) correctly.\n- Computed horizontal length as 21.6 inches using 4x.\n\nI'm confident these steps capture the problem correctly and the calculations seem consistent with the problem given.\n\nThus, the horizontal length of the \"27-inch\" television screen is 21.6 inches. This process feels logical, and the outcome matches expectations for such problems involving diagonal screen size and aspect ratio relationships.",
