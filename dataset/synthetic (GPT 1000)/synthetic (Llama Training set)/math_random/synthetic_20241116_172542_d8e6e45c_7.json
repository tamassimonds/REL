    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by brainstorming strategies and breaking it down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nWe need to find three-digit even integers where the digits increase strictly from left to right. So we're looking for numbers like 246 or 358, but not like 323 or 451.\n\n- First digit (hundreds place) can't be 0, so it ranges from 1 to 9.\n- Since it's a three-digit number, each of its digits must be distinct and increasing.\n- The last digit (units place) must be an even number.\n  \nThe digits must all be different since they have to increase, so no repeats like 233.\n\n**Step 2: Listing Even Digits**\n\nLet's list all possible digits that can be used as the last digit of our number, given that the integer is even:\n- Even digits are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n\n**Step 3: Strategy - Combinations**\n\nTo find the numbers, we'll combine digits such that they are increasing and the last one is even.\n\n- Choose any two other digits from the digits less than the end digit to form the first two digits.\n- They must all be distinct integers between 0 and 9.\n\nFor example, if our final digit is 8, then we can use any two of the digits 1 through 7, and ensure they are in increasing order.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Strategy**\n\nLet's find combinations for each possible even last digit:\n\n1. **Last digit is 0**: \n   - Can't form a three-digit number since no hundreds digit <0 will satisfy the strictly increasing order.\n\n2. **Last digit is 2**:\n   - Possible first two digits: (1)\n   - So possible number: 1, 2 \u2192 One combination [can't use this as even can't be last]\n\n3. **Last digit is 4**:\n   - Possible first two digits: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)\n   - So possible numbers: 124, 134, 234\n\n4. **Last digit is 6**:\n   - Possible first two digits: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).\n   - So possible numbers: 126, 136, 146, 156, 236, 246, 256, 346, 356, 456\n\n5. **Last digit is 8**:\n   - Possible first two digits: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), ..., (6, 7)\n   - So possible numbers: 128, 138, 148, 158, 168, 178, 238, 248, 258, 268, 278, 348, 358, 368, 378, 458, 468, 478, 568, 578, 678\n\n**Step 5: Reflection**\n\nNow, let's count the total numbers obtained:\n\n- Numbers ending in 4: 3 possibilities\n- Numbers ending in 6: 10 possibilities\n- Numbers ending in 8: 21 possibilities\n\nAdding these gives us \\(3 + 10 + 21 = 34\\).\n\nQuick check: the process seems valid as we didn't miss any digits that fit within the constraints (strictly increasing and even).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nSo there are 34 even three-digit integers with digits in strictly increasing order.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the integer have digits $a$, $b$, and $c$, read left to right.  Because $1 \\leq a<b<c$, none of the digits can be zero and $c$ cannot be 2.  If $c=4$, then $a$ and $b$ must each be chosen from the digits 1, 2, and 3.  Therefore there are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ choices for $a$ and $b$, and for each choice there is one acceptable order.  Similarly, for $c=6$ and $c=8$ there are, respectively, $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ and $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ choices for $a$ and $b$. Thus there are altogether $3+10+21=\\boxed{34}$ such integers."
