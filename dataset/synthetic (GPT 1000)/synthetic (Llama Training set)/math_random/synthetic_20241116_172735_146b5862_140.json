    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're dealing with the concept of volume and using it to solve for the size of a larger sphere made from the same steel as eight smaller spheres. Here's how I'm approaching it:\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst impressions:\n- When I see the problem, it immediately makes me think of past physics and math problems involving geometry and volume, especially because spheres are involved.\n- The key here is that the volume of the larger sphere equals the total volume of the eight smaller spheres.\n\n**2. Reviewing Basic Formulas**\n\nTo solve the problem, I need the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n- Volume of a sphere \\(V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\\)\n\n**3. Volume of Smaller Spheres**\n\nStart with the smaller spheres:\n- Each smaller sphere has a radius of 1 inch.\n- Volume of one smaller sphere:\n  \\[ V_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (1)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\]\n- There are 8 smaller spheres, so the total volume is:\n  \\[ V_{\\text{total small}} = 8 \\times \\frac{4}{3} \\pi = \\frac{32}{3} \\pi \\]\n\n**4. Volume of Larger Sphere**\n\nWe know the total volume of the larger sphere is the same, so:\n- \\( V_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{32}{3} \\pi \\)\n\nNow, relate this to the formula for a sphere\u2019s volume:\n- Set the volume of the larger sphere equal to its volume formula:\n  \\[ \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 = \\frac{32}{3} \\pi \\]\n\n**5. Solving for the Radius of the Larger Sphere**\n\nThis seems straightforward if I cancel out the common terms:\n- Cancel \\(\\pi\\) from both sides (assuming \\(\\pi\\) is not zero, which is safe):\n  \\[ \\frac{4}{3} R^3 = \\frac{32}{3} \\]\n- Multiply both sides by 3/4 to isolate \\(R^3\\):\n  \\[ R^3 = \\frac{32}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n- \\[ R^3 = \\frac{32 \\times 3}{3 \\times 4} \\]\n- \\[ R^3 = \\frac{32}{4} = 8 \\]\n\nNow, find the cube root of both sides for \\(R\\):\n- \\( R = \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2 \\)\n\n**6. Reflecting on the Solution**\n\n- This answer seems reasonable since \\(2^3\\) is 8.\n- I double-checked calculations for any missteps, especially in arithmetic. Everything seems to hold together.\n- Logs check out; it's nice to see all factors cancel properly, representing volumes correctly.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe radius of the larger sphere is 2 inches. It matches both the logical progression and the math checks, confirming that the larger steel ball has absorbed the volume of the eight smaller ones more appropriately. \n\nIt's always useful to reflect on whether the steps logically connect and if the final answer appropriately answers the posed question with no loose ends. Here, it appears consistent and tidy.",

  "ground_truth": "The amount of steel used to create one ball with radius 1 is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(1^3)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$; the amount of steel used to create eight of these balls is $8\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi = \\frac{32}{3}\\pi$.\n\nLet the radius of the large steel be $r$.  We have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{32}{3}\\pi$; solving for $r$ yields $r^3 = 8 \\Rightarrow r = 2$.  Thus the radius of the large ball is $\\boxed{2}$ inches."
