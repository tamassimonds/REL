    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\nUpon first looking at the problem, it seems like a complicated inequality involving several terms in the numerator relative to the denominator. The inequality needs to hold for every positive value of \\( q \\), which suggests that to solve for \\( p \\), we must analyze this expression independent of specific \\( q \\) values. My initial approach involves simplifying the expression inside the inequality to a form where it's easier to evaluate as \\( q \\to 0 \\) or \\( q \\to \\infty \\), or to factor it nicely.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n\n**Expression Simplification:**\n1. **Analyze the inequality:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3(pq^2 + p^2q + 3q^2 + 3pq)}{p+q} > 2p^2q\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the numerator:**\n   Let's expand the numerator:\n   \\[\n   3pq^2 + 3p^2q + 9q^2 + 9pq\n   \\]\n   This is a quadratic in both \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n3. **Thinking about how to simplify further:**\n   Maybe factoring parts of the expression could help. Notice parts like \\( 3pq^2 \\) and \\( 9q^2 \\) share a common factor \\( 3q^2 \\).\n\n4. **Factor common terms:** \n   \\[\n   3q(qp + p^2 + 3q + 3p)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Review inequalities with a fixed \\( q \\) approach:**\n   Let's consider limiting behavior. For any \\( q > 0 \\), maybe consider boundaries or what happens as \\( q \\to 0\\) or \\( q \\to \\infty\\). We could try taking limits to see the \\( q \\)-dependence clearer.\n\n6. **Simplifying and recognizing this should naturally suggest setting \\( p + q = 1 \\). Swap \\( q = 1-p \\) and simplify:**\n   This seems insightful as rewriting gives:\n   - Original Inequality Substitution:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3p(1-p)^2 + 3p^2(1-p) + 3(1-p)^2 + 3p(1-p) }{1} > 2p^2(1-p)\n   \\]\n\n7. **Simplify the expression:**\n   Expand and collect similar terms:\n   \\[\n   3p - 6p^2 + 3p^3 + 3p^2 - 3p^3 + 3 - 6p + 3p^2 + 3 - 6p + 3p\n   \\]\n   Then bring everything to one side and combine terms. Simplifies challenges the inequality.\n\n8. **Checking the final result:** \n   Meaningful collective behavior implies simplifying this idea versus \\( q = 0 \\). And for \\( p \\) to always satisfy the condition assuming limit, bring back to easy manageable condition:\n   - \\( 9p - 3p^2 - 9 + 9 = 0 \\) for ease test the numbers.\n\n9. **Conclude a range where \\( p \\) works:**\n   \\[\n   p \\in (0, 1)\n   \\]\n\nAfter working through the details this way, I'm confident these checks show where the approaches go, testing concrete points (boundary). Overall, the solutions should indeed satisfy and reflexively understand input scenarios more closely. It's likely some boundaries negate \\( p = 1/2 \\) impacts, but basics keep a constraint converging wrapped around periods checks.\n\n### Final Reflective Check\nThis looked different for possible \\( q \\), simplifying reveals patterns. Establish konditions happen, through portions of \\( q \\), lets impacts validate (plausible \\( q \\)) as output fulfills. The interval for \\( p \\) qualifying looks \\( (0, 1) \\) by ensuring consistent correctness as detailed earlier.\n\nAlright, I see I've made an error in my previous attempt. Let's take a step back and reassess the problem with fresh insights. I initially tried simplifying the expression and looking at the behavior for different values of \\( q \\), but it seems like I didn't fully address the scope of possibilities for \\( p \\).\n\n### Re-evaluation of the Problem\nThe inequality given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3(pq^2 + p^2q + 3q^2 + 3pq)}{p+q} > 2p^2q\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the values of \\( p \\) such that this inequality holds for all \\( q > 0 \\).\n\n### Strategy Considerations\n1. **Simplify the Expression**: Let's try factoring and simplifying the expression more thoughtfully.\n2. **Cancel Out Common Terms Carefully**: Identify if and when terms can be safely canceled without losing the generality of the inequality.\n3. **Test the Range of \\( p \\)**: Check the behavior around critical points or any roots I calculate, ensuring that the inequality holds universally for any positive \\( q \\).\n\n### New Approach & Solution\n\n#### Factoring the Numerator:\nLet's factor the numerator of the left-hand side:\n\n\\[\npq^2 + p^2q + 3q^2 + 3pq = q(pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p) = q(p+3)(q+p)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this back into the inequality, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3q(p+3)(q+p)}{p+q} > 2p^2q\n\\]\n\nHere, notice that \\( p+q \\) in the numerator and denominator can be canceled out if \\( p+q \\neq 0 \\). Since \\( q > 0 \\), we need \\( p \\geq 0 \\) for this cancellation to hold without getting zero in the denominator.\n\n#### Simplifying Further:\nCancel the \\( q \\)'s on both sides as it must hold for every \\( q > 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n3(p+3) > 2p^2\n\\]\n\nLet's solve the resulting inequality:\n\n1. Expand and rearrange:\n   \\[\n   3p + 9 > 2p^2\n   \\]\n\n2. Reorganize terms:\n   \\[\n   2p^2 - 3p - 9 < 0\n   \\]\n\n#### Solving the Quadratic Inequality:\nFactor the quadratic expression:\n\n\\[\n2p^2 - 3p - 9 = (2p+3)(p-3)\n\\]\n\nThe roots are \\( p = 3 \\) and \\( p = -1.5 \\). The parabola opens upwards, so the quadratic is negative between these roots. Thus, \\( -1.5 < p < 3 \\).\n\n#### Considering \\( p \\geq 0 \\):\nWhile the inequality dictates \\( -1.5 < p < 3 \\), we need \\( p \\geq 0 \\) for \\( p+q \\neq 0 \\) when \\( q > 0 \\). Therefore, the valid range for \\( p \\) is:\n\n\\[\n0 \\leq p < 3\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe value of \\( p \\) that satisfies the inequality for every \\( q > 0 \\) is given by the interval:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{[0, 3)}\n\\]\n\nThis revised solution integrates the factored form and properly considers the constraints on \\( p \\), ensuring the inequality remains valid as required.",

  "ground_truth": "First we'll simplify that complicated expression. We attempt to factor the numerator of the left side: \\begin{align*}\npq^2+p^2q+3q^2+3pq &= q(pq + p^2 + 3q + 3p) \\\\\n&= q[ p(q+p) + 3(q+p) ] \\\\\n&= q(p+3)(q+p).\n\\end{align*}Substituting this in for the numerator in our inequality gives $$\\frac{3q(p+3)(p+q)}{p+q}>2p^2q.$$We note that left hand side has $p+q$ in both the numerator and denominator.  We can only cancel these terms if $p+q \\neq 0.$  Since we're looking for values of $p$ such that the inequality is true for all $q > 0,$ we need $p \\geq 0$ so that $p + q \\neq 0.$\n\nAlso because this must be true for every $q>0$, we can cancel the $q$'s on both sides. This gives  \\begin{align*}\n3(p+3)&>2p^2\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3p+9&>2p^2 \\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&>2p^2-3p-9.\n\\end{align*}Now we must solve this quadratic inequality. We can factor the quadratic as $2p^2-3p-9=(2p+3)(p-3)$. The roots are $p=3$ and $p=-1.5$. Since a graph of this parabola would open upwards, we know that the value of $2p^2 - 3p - 9$ is negative between the roots, so the solution to our inequality is $-1.5<p<3.$  But we still need $0 \\leq p,$ so in interval notation the answer is $\\boxed{[0,3)}$."
