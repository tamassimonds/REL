    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. From the given information, we have a right triangle \\(\\triangle XYZ\\) where \\(\\angle X = 90^\\circ\\), \\(\\tan Y = \\frac{3}{4}\\), and \\(YZ = 30\\). Our task is to find \\(XY\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see this problem, a few things jump out:\n\n1. **Right Triangle:** Since \\(\\angle X\\) is \\(90^\\circ\\), this suggests we could use some fundamental trigonometric identities or the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n2. **Given \\(\\tan Y = \\frac{3}{4}\\):** This involves the ratio of the lengths of the opposite side to the adjacent side of \\(\\angle Y\\). I need to connect this with the known sides of the triangle.\n\n3. **We know \\(YZ = 30\\):** This is the hypotenuse of the triangle.\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Using \\(\\tan Y = \\frac{3}{4}\\):** \n   - This suggests if \\(YZ\\) is the hypotenuse, then the opposite and adjacent sides could be thought of as \\(3k\\) and \\(4k\\) respectively (where \\(k\\) is a common ratio). \n\n2. **Using \\(YZ = 30\\):** \n   - We know the hypotenuse. Maybe putting the above ratios in terms of the hypotenuse could help us find the actual lengths of sides \\(XY\\) and \\(XZ\\).\n\n### Let's Break It Down\n\n1. **Work with \\(\\tan Y\\):** \n   - \\(\\tan Y = \\frac{3}{4}\\) implies that for \\(\\triangle XYZ\\), with respect to \\(\\angle Y\\), the sides can be labeled as \\(XZ = 3k\\) and \\(XY = 4k\\).\n\n2. **Connecting to the hypotenuse:** \n   - We have found out that in terms of \\(k\\):\n   \\[\n   YZ = 30 \\quad \\text{(hypotenuse)}\n   \\]\n   - Using the Pythagorean theorem: \\((3k)^2 + (4k)^2 = YZ^2\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\(k\\):**\n   - From the Pythagorean theorem:\n   \\[\n   (3k)^2 + (4k)^2 = 30^2\n   \\]\n   - Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   9k^2 + 16k^2 = 900\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   25k^2 = 900\n   \\]\n   - Solve for \\(k\\):\n   \\[\n   k^2 = \\frac{900}{25} = 36\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find \\(XY\\):**\n   - \\(XY = 4k = 4 \\times 6 = 24\\)\n\n### Reflect and Verify\n\nLet's go over everything to ensure it's consistent:\n\n- **Verify \\(Y = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\):** Given \\(XZ = 18\\) and \\(XY = 24\\), \\(\\tan Y = \\frac{18}{24} = \\frac{3}{4}\\) which matches our initial condition.\n  \n- **Double-check calculations:** From the derived \\(k = 6\\), substituting back matches the given hypotenuse \\(YZ = 30\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThrough checking work and reflecting, the solution appears consistent across different approaches. Therefore, the length of \\(XY\\) is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).",

Since $\\tan Y = \\frac34$, we have $XZ = 3k$ and $XY = 4k$ for some value of $k$, as shown in the diagram.  Therefore, $\\triangle XYZ$ is a 3-4-5 triangle.  Since the hypotenuse has length $30 = 5\\cdot 6$, the legs have lengths $XZ = 3\\cdot 6 = 18$ and $XY = 4\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{24}$."
