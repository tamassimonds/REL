  "problem": "Jenny has 8 stamp books that each contain 42 pages.  Each page in her books contains 6 stamps.  Jenny decides to reorganize her stamp books such that each page contains 10 stamps.  This will give her more space to collect stamps without having to buy new books.  Under her new system, Jenny fills up 4 complete books, still with 42 pages per book.  Her fifth book now contains 33 pages filled with 10 stamps per page and 1 last page with the remaining stamps.  How many stamps are on that last page?",

    "working_out": "First thoughts: Okay, so I'm dealing with stamps and reorganization in terms of space management. Jenny has stamp books with pages, and she wants to reconfigure how the stamps are organized on each page. The final goal is to figure out how many stamps are on the last page of her newly organized collection. Hmm, this seems like a straightforward exercise in multiplication and division. Let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how many stamps Jenny originally has:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Stamps**\n\n- Jenny has 8 stamp books, each with 42 pages. Each page originally has 6 stamps.\n- The total number of pages is: \\( 8 \\text{ books} \\times 42 \\text{ pages/book} = 336 \\text{ pages} \\).\n- The total number of stamps: \\( 336 \\text{ pages} \\times 6 \\text{ stamps/page} = 2016 \\text{ stamps} \\).\n\nWait, let's check if this seems sensible. If each page has 6 stamps, and there are 336 pages, multiplying these should give me the total number of stamps, which is 2016. Yeah, that seems correct. Good. Moving on.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the New Configuration**\n\nJenny reorganizes her stamps to fit 10 stamps per page. She fills 4 complete books with this configuration:\n\n- 4 books have 42 pages each, so a total of: \\( 4 \\times 42 = 168 \\text{ pages} \\).\n- With 10 stamps per page, these can hold: \\( 168 \\times 10 = 1680 \\text{ stamps} \\).\n\nLet's double-check this: Calculating stamps by multiplying the number of pages with stamps per page seems logical, and \\( 1680 \\) stamps feels reasonable because 168 pages with more capacity (10 vs. 6) should hold more stamps than before. Yeah, this adds up.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Stamps in the Fifth Book**\n\nNow, let's see how many stamps are in the fifth book.\n\n- The fifth book has 33 full pages of stamps: \\( 33 \\times 10 = 330 \\text{ stamps} \\).\n\nNeed to verify again: Comparing our previous results fits; there are 33 pages filled comfortably here. \n\n**Step 4: Remaining Stamps Calculation**\n\nNow, how many stamps are left for the last page of the fifth book?\n\n- Total number of stamps used so far is \\( 1680 + 330 = 2010 \\).\n- Total stamps Jenny started with: 2016.\n- Remaining stamps: \\( 2016 - 2010 = 6 \\).\n\nLet's pause to verify this: The earlier calculation of stamps makes sense if I sum up 1680 from 4 books and 330 from 33 pages of the 5th book getting me to 2010 stamps used. There are 6 stamps left, which checks out with my previous calculations. \n\n**Final Reflection**\n\nWell, my approach to take it book by book and page by page checks out. I double-checked calculations and reasoning at each step. It seems the number of stamps on her last page is 6. It matches logically and mathematically with all prior numbers. \n\nI\u2019m confident that 6 stamps are indeed on Jenny\u2019s last page.",

  "ground_truth": "Since Jenny's new system of arranging stamps includes 10 on each page, the number of the last page will be the units digit of her total number of stamps (in base 10).  That units digit is the same as the units digit of $8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 = 96$, which is $\\boxed{6}$."
