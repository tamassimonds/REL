    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem of converting cylindrical coordinates to rectangular coordinates step-by-step. \n\n### Initial Understanding\n\nI'm given the point \\((8, \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\sqrt{3})\\) in cylindrical coordinates. In cylindrical coordinates, the components usually represent \\((r, \\theta, z)\\), where:\n- \\( r \\) is the radial distance from the origin in the xy-plane.\n- \\( \\theta \\) is the angle measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\n- \\( z \\) is the height from the xy-plane.\n\nThe goal is to convert this into rectangular coordinates \\((x, y, z)\\).\n\n### Brainstorming and Strategy\n\nTo convert from cylindrical to rectangular coordinates, I know I have to use these formulas:\n\n- \\( x = r \\cos(\\theta) \\)\n- \\( y = r \\sin(\\theta) \\)\n- \\( z = z \\)\n\nI'm reflecting on this... Oh! These formulas make sense because they directly relate the radial component and angle to the Cartesian \\(x\\), \\(y\\) components. The \\(z\\) component remains unchanged since it represents the same vertical position in both systems.\n\nLet's proceed with the conversion using the formulas.\n\n### Step-by-Step Conversion\n\n1. **Calculate \\(x\\)**\n\n   Using the formula \\(x = r \\cos(\\theta)\\):\n   \n   \\[\n   x = 8 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   I know from trigonometry that \\(\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). So,\n\n   \\[\n   x = 8 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Wait, let me double-check this... Yes, I remember that the cosine of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) is indeed \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). The arithmetic seems right too.\n\n2. **Calculate \\(y\\)**\n\n   Now for \\(y = r \\sin(\\theta)\\):\n\n   \\[\n   y = 8 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   Similarly, \\(\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). Hence,\n\n   \\[\n   y = 8 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 4\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Let me verify this again... Hmm, yes, the sine value matches, and the calculation is consistent with the one for \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Calculate \\(z\\)**\n\n   For \\(z\\), since it is the same in both cylindrical and rectangular coordinates:\n\n   \\[\n   z = \\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n   There's no calculation needed here since it's directly given.\n\n### Final Check\n\nHere's the final result:\n\n- \\(x = 4\\sqrt{2}\\)\n- \\(y = 4\\sqrt{2}\\)\n- \\(z = \\sqrt{3}\\)\n\nLet me step back and see if this makes sense... The radial distance \\(r\\) directly influences both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) symmetrically because \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), which is exactly at the 45-degree angle where \\(\\sin\\) and \\(\\cos\\) are equal. The height remains unchanged.\n\nIt seems everything clicks together. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rectangular coordinates corresponding to the cylindrical point \\((8, \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\sqrt{3})\\) are \\((4\\sqrt{2}, 4\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\). Everything checks out under scrutiny; the approach feels correct, and the calculations seem sound.\n\nThat was a productive walk-through!",
