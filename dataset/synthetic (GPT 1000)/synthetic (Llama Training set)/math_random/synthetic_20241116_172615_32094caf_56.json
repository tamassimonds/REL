    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem about counting the number of different three-letter sets of initials possible using the letters \\(A\\) through \\(G\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- The problem immediately reminds me of a permutation or combination scenario since we're dealing with arranging letters.\n- Given letters \\(A\\) through \\(G\\), that's 7 letters total.\n- My gut says this might be a straightforward permutations/combination problem, but I need to think through if these initials mean unique letters or if repeats are allowed.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n- We are dealing with three-letter initials.\n- The letters are \\(A, B, C, D, E, F, G\\).\n- A three-letter initial implies we're choosing or arranging three out of these put together.\n- We need to determine if repetitions are allowed. Generally, initials like \"AAA\" could be possible if repetitions are indeed allowed.\n\n**Step 2: Strategy Brainstorming**\n- **Permutation with Repetition:** If repetitions are allowed, then each position (1st, 2nd, 3rd) in the initials can independently be any of the 7 letters.\n- **Counting with Repetition:** I'd use the formula for a permutation where repetition is allowed, which is \\(n^r\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of items to choose from and \\(r\\) is the length of the permutation (in this case, initials).\n  \n- **Combination and Permutations without Repetition:** If repetitions are not allowed and each letter must be unique, it would be \\(nPr\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items and \\(r\\) is the number to choose.\n\n**Step 3: Decision Making**\n- Let's assume at first that repetitions are allowed since we typically assume so unless otherwise stated. We are considering permutations of 3 letters from 7, where each can repeat. \n- The formula is \\(n^r\\): here, \\(7^3\\).\n\n**Step 4: Calculation with Permutation Allowing Repetition**\n- Calculating \\(7^3\\) gives:\n  \\[\n  7^3 = 7 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 343\n  \\]\n- Wow, 343 seems like a large number, but it seems plausible because repeats are indeed allowed and it's symmetrical for all positions.\n\n**Step 5: Verification and Reflection**\n- Let's think about it: we are basically saying for each of the 3 positions, independently, we can choose any of the 7 letters (like a PIN number choosing from 0-9 each position).\n- Each position is independent of the others, hence the multiplication of choices.\n- With \"AAA\" being a possibility (and \"ABA\", \"CCCC\" being invalid as there's no \\(C\\)), the number 343 holds.\n- Reflecting back: I tackled it from the idea of repeats allowed and the calculation confirms it aligns with our thinking.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\n- Therefore, the total number of different three-letter sets of initials (assuming repetitions allowed) possible using the letters \\(A\\) through \\(G\\) is \\(\\boxed{343}\\).\n\nThis was a straightforward approach assuming repetitions, and verification steps backed up our theory and model. If the assumption about repetition was incorrect, changing our model to non-repetition would involve another calculation, but our approach fits the idea of freely choosing per position.",
