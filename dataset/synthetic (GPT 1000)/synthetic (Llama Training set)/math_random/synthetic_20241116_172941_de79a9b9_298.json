    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\nThe problem involves a piecewise function \\(f(a, b)\\) defined differently based on the condition of \\(a + b \\leq 3\\) or \\(a + b > 3\\). This suggests that determining which part of the piecewise definition to use is crucial.\n\nSince we need to compute \\(f(2, 1) + f(2, 4)\\), I should evaluate \\(f\\) separately for each pair of \\((a, b)\\).\n\nFirst, I'll focus on one piece at a time and carefully apply the condition to check which part of the function applies for the given values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nFor \\(f(2,1)\\):\n\n1. Let me quickly check which condition applies: \n\n   - \\(a + b = 2 + 1 = 3\\)\n   \n   Since \\(3 \\leq 3\\), the condition \\(a + b \\le 3\\) is satisfied. So, we use the first part of the piecewise function:\n   \\[\n   f(a,b) = \\dfrac{ab - a + 2}{2a}\n   \\]\n\n2. Substituting \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 1\\) into the expression:\n   \\[\n   f(2, 1) = \\dfrac{2 \\cdot 1 - 2 + 2}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\dfrac{2 - 2 + 2}{4} = \\dfrac{2}{4} = \\dfrac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. I should double-check this math: Subtracting inside the numerator \\(2 - 2\\) gives \\(0\\), then adding \\(2\\) gives \\(2\\). Yep, division of \\(2\\) by \\(4\\) equals \\(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\). That looks good.\n\nNow for \\(f(2,4)\\):\n\n1. Check which condition applies:\n\n   - \\(a + b = 2 + 4 = 6\\)\n   \n   Since \\(6 > 3\\), the second piece applies: \n   \\[\n   f(a,b) = \\dfrac{ab - b - 2}{-2b}\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 4\\):\n   \\[\n   f(2, 4) = \\dfrac{2 \\cdot 4 - 4 - 2}{-2 \\cdot 4} = \\dfrac{8 - 4 - 2}{-8} = \\dfrac{2}{-8} = -\\dfrac{1}{4}\n   \\]\n\n3. Let me verify. Multiply \\(a\\) and \\(b\\): \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\). Subtract \\(4\\): \\(8 - 4 = 4\\). Subtract \\(2\\): \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). Then division: \\(2/-8 = -\\dfrac{1}{4}\\). Yes, that seems correct.\n\nLastly, calculate \\(f(2, 1) + f(2, 4)\\):\n\n\\[\nf(2, 1) + f(2, 4) = \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\left(-\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right)\n\\]\n\nI need to find a common denominator to add these fractions:\n\n- The common denominator of \\(2\\) and \\(4\\) is \\(4\\).\n\nConvert \\(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\) to \\(\\dfrac{2}{4}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{2}{4} + \\left(-\\dfrac{1}{4}\\right) = \\dfrac{2 - 1}{4} = \\dfrac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nGreat, after checking my work at each step, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}\n\\]",
