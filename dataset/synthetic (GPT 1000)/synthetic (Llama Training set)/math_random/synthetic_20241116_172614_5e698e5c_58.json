    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem! We're given two functions, \\( f(x) = \\frac{x}{5} + 3 \\) and \\( g(x) = 4 - x \\), and we need to solve for \\( a \\) in the equation \\( f(g(a)) = 5 \\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - We need to find \\( a \\) such that when we apply \\( g \\) to \\( a \\) and then apply \\( f \\) to the result, we get 5. \n   - This is a composition of functions problem, which is something I've encountered before.\n\n2. **Strategy Exploration**:\n   - We could start by first computing \\( g(a) \\), then substitute it into \\( f(x) \\), and set the result equal to 5 to solve for \\( a \\).\n   - Alternatively, we could try solving it backwards by setting \\( f(x) = 5 \\) and then finding out when \\( g(a) \\) satisfies this constraint.\n   - Let's try substituting \\( g(a) \\) into \\( f(x) \\) and see where it leads us.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Substitute \\( g(a) \\) into \\( f(x) \\)**:\n   - Recall \\( g(x) = 4 - x \\). Thus, \\( g(a) = 4 - a \\).\n   - Now, substitute \\( g(a) \\) into \\( f(x) \\).\n     \\[\n     f(g(a)) = f(4 - a)\n     \\]\n   - Substitute into the function \\( f \\):\n     \\[\n     f(4 - a) = \\frac{4 - a}{5} + 3\n     \\]\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation**:\n   - We know \\( f(g(a)) = 5 \\), so let's set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4 - a}{5} + 3 = 5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( a \\)**:\n   - First, get rid of the 3 on the left side by subtracting 3 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4 - a}{5} = 2\n     \\]\n   - Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:\n     \\[\n     4 - a = 10\n     \\]\n   - Now, solve for \\( a \\) by isolating it:\n     \\[\n     -a = 10 - 4\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -a = 6\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a = -6\n     \\]\n\n4. **Checking the Solution**:\n   - Let's verify: Calculate \\( g(-6) = 4 - (-6) = 4 + 6 = 10 \\).\n   - Now calculate \\( f(10) \\):\n     \\[\n     f(10) = \\frac{10}{5} + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5\n     \\]\n   - Perfect, it matches! Our solution \\( a = -6 \\) is correct.\n\n### Reflection:\n\n- Initially, I thought about different strategies to solve the problem, and my chosen approach worked smoothly.\n- Breaking down the composition of functions helped clarify the path forward.\n- Solving and then verifying ensured the correctness of the solution, and indeed, \\( a = -6 \\) satisfies \\( f(g(a)) = 5 \\).\n\nI feel confident in this approach and the solution. Great! Now onward to the next problem!",
