    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into solving this problem together, bearing in mind that a step-by-step exploration is key. \n\n**First Thoughts:** I see that we have a constraint with a quadratic-looking equation involving two integers, \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). My job is to find out how likely I am to pick an integer \\(p\\) from 1 to 10 such that the equation has some integer solution for \\(q\\). This equation looks a bit like something I\u2019ve probably done before where I need to solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\n**Initial Strategy:** Let\u2019s take the given equation, \\(pq - 4p - 2q = 2\\), and try to see what happens if we isolate \\(q\\) or \\(p\\). Often, in these types of problems, expressing one variable in terms of the other helps. \n\n### Algebraic Manipulation:\nLet's start by rearranging the terms to express one variable in terms of the other:\n\n\\[ pq - 4p - 2q = 2 \\]\n\nRearrange to express \\(pq\\):\n\n\\[ pq = 4p + 2q + 2 \\]\n\nThis doesn't look too straightforward. Another formula rearrangement might be more insightful. Let's see if factoring makes any sense:\n\nTrying to factor or re-structure here:\n\n\\[ pq - 4p - 2q = 2\\]\n\n\\[\npq - 2q - 4p = 2 \n\\]\n\nCompleting some factorization might help here. I will try to factor by grouping:\n\n- First look at the expression: notice terms in terms of \\(q\\): \n  \\[ q(p - 2) - 4p = 2 \\]\n\nExpress \\(q\\) using another approach: \n\n\\[ q = \\frac{4p + 2}{p-2} \\]\n\nThis rational expression needs \\(p \\neq 2\\) since it would cause division by zero. \n\n### Testing Different \\(p\\) Values:\nNow, for each integer value of \\(p\\) between 1 and 10, let\u2019s see if \\(q\\) is an integer.\n\n- **\\(p = 1\\):** \n  \\[ q = \\frac{4 \\cdot 1 + 2}{1 - 2} = \\frac{6}{-1} = -6 \\]\n  \\(q\\) is an integer.\n\n- **\\(p = 2\\):** \n   Undefined, as found earlier due to division by zero.\n\n- **\\(p = 3\\):**\n   \\[ q = \\frac{4 \\times 3 + 2}{3 - 2} = \\frac{14}{1} = 14 \\]\n   \\(q\\) is an integer.\n\n- **\\(p = 4\\):**\n   \\[ q = \\frac{4 \\times 4 + 2}{4 - 2} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\]\n   \\(q\\) is an integer.\n\n- **\\(p = 5\\):**\n   \\[ q = \\frac{4 \\times 5 + 2}{5 - 2} = \\frac{22}{3} \\]\n   \\(q\\) is not an integer.\n\n- **\\(p = 6\\):**\n   \\[ q = \\frac{4 \\times 6 + 2}{6 - 2} = \\frac{26}{4} = \\frac{13}{2} \\]\n   \\(q\\) is not an integer.\n\n- **\\(p = 7\\):**\n   \\[ q = \\frac{4 \\times 7 + 2}{7 - 2} = \\frac{30}{5} = 6 \\]\n   \\(q\\) is an integer.\n\n- **\\(p = 8\\):**\n   \\[ q = \\frac{4 \\times 8 + 2}{8 - 2} = \\frac{34}{6}, \\]\n   Unlikely to be an integer as 34/6 is not an integer.\n\n- **\\(p = 9\\):**\n   \\[ q = \\frac{4 \\times 9 + 2}{9 - 2} = \\frac{38}{7}, \\]\n   Not an integer.\n\n- **\\(p = 10\\):**\n   \\[ q = \\frac{4 \\times 10 + 2}{10 - 2} = \\frac{42}{8} = \\frac{21}{4} \\]\n   Not an integer.\n\n### Probability Calculation:\nValid \\(p\\) values that make \\(q\\) an integer: 1, 3, 4, 7.\n\nThus, there are 4 suitable values out of 10 possible values of \\(p\\).\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} \\]\n\n**Conclusion and Checks:**  \nI went through systematically to isolate \\(q\\), and it seemed insightful as it provided integers. Testing each \\(p\\), checking for integer solutions worked well. I looked for integer solutions and found that 4 worked out of 1-10 without division issues. Upon verifying each arithmetic solution, the probability solution seems consistent. \n\nFinal answer: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}\\)",

  "ground_truth": "We approach this problem by trying to find solutions to the equation $pq - 4p - 2q = 2$. To do this, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $8$ to both sides to get $pq - 4p - 2q + 8 = 10$. This can be factored into $$(p-2)(q-4)=10$$  We now can see that there are solutions only if $p-2$ divides $10$. Thus, there are $4$ possible values of $p$ between $1$ and $10$ inclusive $(1,3,4 \\text{ and } 7)$. It follows that the probability of picking such a $p$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$."
