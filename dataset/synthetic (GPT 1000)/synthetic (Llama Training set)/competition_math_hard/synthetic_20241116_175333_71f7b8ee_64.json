    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and see what strategies I can brainstorm to find the greatest integer value of \\( b \\) such that the expression \n\n\\[\n\\frac{9x^3 + 4x^2 + 11x + 7}{x^2 + bx + 8}\n\\]\n\nhas a domain of all real numbers. \n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Polynomials and Rational Functions:** I remember that for a rational function to have a domain of all real numbers, the denominator must not be zero for any real \\( x \\). This hints that \\( x^2 + bx + 8 \\) should never equal zero.\n\n2. **Discriminant Approach:** Maybe I can use the discriminant of the quadratic denominator. If the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real roots, meaning it won\u2019t equal zero for any real \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Completing the Square:** Another option is to complete the square for the quadratic expression, which might help me understand its range and whether it can ever be zero.\n\n4. **Substituting Values:** I could try substituting different integer values for \\( b \\) to see which one makes the discriminant negative, but that feels a bit trial-and-errorish unless I set it up systematically.\n\n5. **Synthetic Division or Polynomial Long Division:** Since we\u2019re dealing with polynomials in both numerator and denominator, maybe dividing one by the other could give insights, but I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.\n\nHmm, starting with the discriminant approach seems straightforward and mathematically solid. If that doesn\u2019t pan out, I\u2019ll consider completing the square or maybe substituting values as a backup.\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying the Condition for the Domain**\n\n**Thoughts:**\nSo, for the rational function to have a domain of all real numbers, the denominator \\( x^2 + bx + 8 \\) must never be zero. \n\nWait, this is the same as saying that the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + bx + 8 = 0 \\) has no real solutions. \n\n**Action:**\nThis implies that the discriminant of the quadratic must be less than zero.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Discriminant**\n\n**Thoughts:**\nOkay, I remember that for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), the discriminant \\( \\Delta \\) is given by \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\). \n\nBut here, I need to be careful because the numerator is also a polynomial, but for the domain restriction, only the denominator matters.\n\n**Action:**\nLet me write down the denominator:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + bx + 8\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = b \\), and \\( c = 8 \\).\n\nSo, the discriminant is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 8 = b^2 - 32\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, does this make sense? Yes, because if \\( b^2 - 32 < 0 \\), then there are no real roots for the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + bx + 8 = 0 \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up the Inequality**\n\n**Thoughts:**\nNow, to ensure there are no real roots, I need:\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 32 < 0\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nb^2 < 32\n\\]\n\n**Action:**\nTaking the square root on both sides, I get:\n\n\\[\n|b| < \\sqrt{32} \\approx 5.656854\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, since \\( b \\) must be an integer, the largest integer less than or equal to 5.656854 is 5. So, \\( b \\) can be at most 5.\n\n### **Step 4: Checking if \\( b = 5 \\) Works**\n\n**Thoughts:**\nLet me check if \\( b = 5 \\) satisfies the condition \\( b^2 < 32 \\):\n\n\\[\n5^2 = 25 < 32\n\\]\n\nThis seems correct. \n\n**Action:**\nBut just to be sure, let\u2019s verify that with \\( b = 5 \\), the discriminant is indeed negative:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = 5^2 - 32 = 25 - 32 = -7\n\\]\n\nSince -7 is less than zero, the quadratic \\( x^2 + 5x + 8 \\) has no real roots.\n\n### **Step 5: Considering \\( b \\) Greater than 5**\n\n**Thoughts:**\nWait a minute, what if I consider \\( b = 6 \\)? Let me see if that still works.\n\n\\[\n6^2 = 36\n\\]\n\nBut according to our condition, \\( 36 < 32 \\) is false. So \\( b = 6 \\) doesn't satisfy the inequality \\( b^2 < 32 \\).\n\n**Action:**\nLet\u2019s check the discriminant for \\( b = 6 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = 6^2 - 32 = 36 - 32 = 4\n\\]\n\nSince 4 is positive, the quadratic \\( x^2 + 6x + 8 \\) has real roots, meaning the denominator can be zero for some \\( x \\). Therefore, the domain wouldn't be all real numbers.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis confirms that \\( b = 5 \\) is indeed the greatest integer value that keeps the discriminant negative, ensuring the denominator doesn\u2019t equal zero for any real \\( x \\).\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nSo, after checking and reflecting on various strategies, the greatest integer value of \\( b \\) for which the expression has a domain of all real numbers is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Discriminant for \\( b = 5 \\):** Negative, no real roots in the denominator.\n- **Discriminant for \\( b = 6 \\):** Positive, real roots in the denominator.\n\nEverything seems to align correctly, confirming that \\( b = 5 \\) is the solution.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Brainstormed different strategies:** Discriminant approach worked best.\n- **Calculated the discriminant:** Found that \\( b^2 < 32 \\) is the condition.\n- **Checked \\( b = 5 \\):** Valid, keeps denominator non-zero.\n- **Reflected on \\( b = 6 \\):** Invalid, leads to real roots in denominator.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with continuous checking and reflection, led to the correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "In order for the expression to have a domain of all real numbers, the quadratic $x^2+bx+8 = 0$ must have no real roots.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 8 = b^2 - 32$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $b^2 - 32 < 0$, or $b^2 < 32$.
