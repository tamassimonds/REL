    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like a human would when dealing with a math problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the function \\( G(x) = |x + 1| - |x - 1| \\), my immediate reaction is:\n\n- **Absolute Values:** This involves absolute value expressions, which typically means the function behaves differently depending on the value of \\( x \\) relative to certain points.\n  \n- **Critical Points:** Absolute values change at their \"zero points.\" For \\( |x + 1| \\), that's at \\( x = -1 \\); for \\( |x - 1| \\), it's at \\( x = 1 \\). So, I should consider these points.\n\n- **Piecewise Definition:** Maybe I need to break the function into parts based on these critical points. That reminds me of how piecewise functions work.\n\nBut honestly, I'm also a bit unsure. It's been a while since I've dealt with absolute values in this way, so I might need to explore different strategies to see what works best.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Piecewise Analysis:** As mentioned, maybe I can define \\( G(x) \\) in different regions split by the critical points \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Graphical Approach:** Perhaps sketching the graphs of \\( |x + 1| \\) and \\( |x - 1| \\) separately could help visualize their difference.\n\n3. **Algebraic Simplification:** Trying to simplify \\( G(x) \\) algebraically by removing the absolute values within each piece would be another approach.\n\nHmm, the **piecewise analysis** seems like a solid starting point because it directly addresses how absolute values behave based on \\( x \\)'s value. But I should also consider **graphing** to confirm my findings or intuition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Piecewise Analysis**\n\nLet's try breaking down \\( G(x) \\) based on the critical points:\n\n- **For \\( x < -1 \\):** Here, both \\( x + 1 \\) and \\( x - 1 \\) are negative.\n  \n  - So, \\( |x + 1| = -(x + 1) = -x - 1 \\)\n  - And \\( |x - 1| = -(x - 1) = -x + 1 \\)\n  \n  Therefore,\n  \\[\n  G(x) = (-x - 1) - (-x + 1) = -x - 1 + x - 1 = -2\n  \\]\n  \n  Wait a second\u2014so for all \\( x < -1 \\), \\( G(x) = -2 \\)? That seems straightforward.\n\n- **For \\( -1 \\leq x < 1 \\):** In this range, \\( x + 1 \\) is non-negative and \\( x - 1 \\) is negative.\n  \n  - So, \\( |x + 1| = x + 1 \\)\n  - And \\( |x - 1| = -(x - 1) = -x + 1 \\)\n  \n  Therefore,\n  \\[\n  G(x) = (x + 1) - (-x + 1) = x + 1 + x - 1 = 2x\n  \\]\n  \n  Okay, so \\( G(x) = 2x \\) for this range.\n\n- **For \\( x \\geq 1 \\):** Here, both \\( x + 1 \\) and \\( x - 1 \\) are non-negative.\n  \n  - So, \\( |x + 1| = x + 1 \\)\n  - And \\( |x - 1| = x - 1 \\)\n  \n  Therefore,\n  \\[\n  G(x) = (x + 1) - (x - 1) = x + 1 - x + 1 = 2\n  \\]\n  \n  So for all \\( x \\geq 1 \\), \\( G(x) = 2 \\).\n\n**Reflection:** This piecewise breakdown seems logical. It aligns with how absolute values behave. But let me double-check by considering the **graphical approach** to ensure consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying with the Graphical Approach**\n\nI think it would help to visualize \\( G(x) \\) by looking at the graphs of \\( |x + 1| \\) and \\( |x - 1| \\) separately. The difference between these two graphs will show \\( G(x) \\).\n\n- **Graph of \\( |x + 1| \\):** This is a V-shape starting at \\( x = -1 \\).\n  \n  - For \\( x < -1 \\), it's \\( -(x + 1) \\)\n  - For \\( x \\geq -1 \\), it's \\( x + 1 \\)\n\n- **Graph of \\( |x - 1| \\):** Another V-shape starting at \\( x = 1 \\).\n  \n  - For \\( x < 1 \\), it's \\( -(x - 1) \\)\n  - For \\( x \\geq 1 \\), it's \\( x - 1 \\)\n\nNow, \\( G(x) \\) is the vertical difference between these two graphs:\n\n- **For \\( x < -1 \\):** Both graphs are decreasing lines, but \\( |x + 1| \\) is always less negative than \\( |x - 1| \\), so their difference is constant at \\(-2\\).\n\n- **For \\( -1 \\leq x < 1 \\):** The graph of \\( |x + 1| \\) is increasing, and \\( |x - 1| \\) is decreasing, making their difference linear: \\( G(x) = 2x \\).\n\n- **For \\( x \\geq 1 \\):** Both graphs are increasing, but \\( |x + 1| \\) is always equal or greater than \\( |x - 1| \\), so their difference is constant at \\( 2 \\).\n\n**Reflection:** This graphical approach confirms the piecewise analysis. The behavior of \\( G(x) \\) aligns with the differences between the two absolute value functions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Writing the Piecewise Function**\n\nNow that I'm confident in the piecewise breakdown, let's formally write \\( G(x) \\) as:\n\n\\[\nG(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n-2 & \\text{if } x < -1 \\\\\n2x & \\text{if } -1 \\leq x < 1 \\\\\n2 & \\text{if } x \\geq 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** This makes sense because:\n- For \\( x < -1 \\), \\( G(x) = -2 \\) is constant.\n- For \\( -1 \\leq x < 1 \\), \\( G(x) = 2x \\) is linear, passing through the origin.\n- For \\( x \\geq 1 \\), \\( G(x) = 2 \\) is constant again.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determining the Range**\n\nNow, let's find the **range** of \\( G(x) \\), i.e., the set of all possible output values.\n\n1. **For \\( x < -1 \\):** \\( G(x) = -2 \\). So, the range includes \\(-2\\).\n\n2. **For \\( -1 \\leq x < 1 \\):** \\( G(x) = 2x \\). As \\( x \\) varies:\n   - At \\( x = -1 \\), \\( G(-1) = 2(-1) = -2 \\).\n   - At \\( x = 0 \\), \\( G(0) = 0 \\).\n   - At \\( x = 1 \\), \\( G(1) = 2(1) = 2 \\).\n   \n   Therefore, the range in this interval is from \\(-2\\) to \\(2\\), not including \\(2\\) because \\( x = 1 \\) is in the next piece.\n\n3. **For \\( x \\geq 1 \\):** \\( G(x) = 2 \\). So, the range includes \\(2\\).\n\n**Combining Ranges:**\n- From \\( x < -1 \\): \\(-2\\)\n- From \\( -1 \\leq x < 1 \\): \\(-2\\) to just below \\(2\\)\n- From \\( x \\geq 1 \\): \\(2\\)\n\n**Thus, the range is:** \\(\\{-2\\} \\cup (-2, 2) \\cup \\{2\\}\\)\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, that doesn't seem right. I should double-check the continuity at \\( x = 1 \\). Is \\( 2 \\) included in the range?\n\n- Since the piecewise function specifies \\( G(x) = 2 \\) for \\( x \\geq 1 \\), and \\( x = 1 \\) falls in this category, \\( 2 \\) is included.\n\n- However, the interval \\( -2 < x < 2 \\) in the second piece doesn't include \\(2\\) because it's strictly less than \\(2\\).\n\n**Final Range:** \\([-2, 2]\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Expressing the Range in Interval Notation**\n\nThe range in interval notation is:\n\n\\[\n[-2, 2]\n\\]\n\n**Check:** This includes:\n- \\(-2\\) from the first piece\n- All values between \\(-2\\) and \\(2\\) from the second piece\n- \\(2\\) from the third piece\n\n**Reflection:** It looks correct now. The range covers all values from \\(-2\\) to \\(2\\), inclusive.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\nBy breaking down the function into its piecewise components, verifying with graphical insights, and carefully determining the range, I've concluded that the range of \\( G(x) \\) is \\([-2, 2]\\).\n\nThroughout the process, checking each step ensured accuracy, and reflecting on each approach helped catch and correct any initial misjudgments. This methodical approach mirrors how I would naturally think through and solve a problem on paper.\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough aligns with the sample solution you're looking for\u2014examining multiple strategies, reflecting on their validity, and arriving at a well-checked final answer.",
