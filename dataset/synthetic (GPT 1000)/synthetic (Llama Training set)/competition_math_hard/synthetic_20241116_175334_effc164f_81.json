    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a natural human thought process with brainstorming, reflections, and checking along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, let's see what's going on here. The question mentions:\n\n- **Crestwood Elementary School** has a four-square league with **ten players**, including **Justin** and **Tim**.\n- Each day, they split into **two games** of five players each.\n- Over a semester, **each possible match-up of five players occurs once**.\n  \nThe goal is to **determine how many times Justin played in the same game as Tim**.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Total Players:** 10\n- **Teams per Day:** 2 teams of 5 players each\n- **Each Player's Unique Game:** Each combination of five players occurs exactly once\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Combinatorial Approach:** Calculate the total number of unique teams and see how many include both Justin and Tim.\n2. **Probability Approach:** Consider the likelihood of Justin and Tim being on the same team each day.\n3. **Enumeration:** List out possible team combinations involving Justin and Tim.\n\nAt first glance, the **Combinatorial Approach** seems most straightforward. But let me explore each method briefly to see which feels right.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Combinatorial Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I'm thinking about calculating the **total number of unique five-player teams** that can be formed from ten players.\n- Then, I could find out how many of these teams include both Justin and Tim.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Unique Teams**\n\n- The total number of ways to choose 5 players out of 10 is represented by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{10}{5}\\).\n  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5! \\times 5!} = 252\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait, that means there are **252 unique teams** in total. Each team plays exactly once throughout the semester, so all 252 teams are covered.\n- This seems to make sense because it accounts for every possible combination without repetition.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Teams Including Both Justin and Tim**\n\n- Now, to find how many teams include both Justin and Tim, I need to choose **3 more players** from the remaining 8.\n  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3! \\times 5!} = 56\n  \\]\n\n**Check: Comparing Strategies**\n\n- **Combinatorial Approach Results:** Seems straightforward. 56 teams include both Justin and Tim.\n- **Alternative Strategies (Probability Approach):** I'll explore this next to confirm the validity of the combinatorial method.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Probability Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let's consider the **probability of Justin and Tim being on the same team** for each unique match-up.\n- If we can find this probability, we can multiply it by the total number of match-ups to get the number of times they played together.\n\n**Step 1: Determine Probability for a Single Match-Up**\n\n- **Total Possible Teams:** \\(\\binom{10}{5} = 252\\)\n- **Favorable Teams (Including Both Justin and Tim):** \\(\\binom{8}{3} = 56\\)\n  \n  So, the probability \\(P\\) of Justin and Tim being on the same team is:\n\n  \\[\n  P = \\frac{56}{252} = \\frac{2}{9}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Multiply by Total Match-Ups**\n\n- Since there are **252 unique match-ups** in total where each team plays exactly once:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of Times Justin and Tim Played Together} = \\frac{2}{9} \\times 252 = 56\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- Both strategies yield the **same result**: 56. This consistency is reassuring.\n- **Quick Check:** The probability seems reasonable; \\(\\frac{2}{9}\\) is about \\(22.22\\%\\), which feels plausible for each unique team match-up.\n\n**Counterchecking:**\n\n- Total number of unique match-ups: 252\n- Probability of Justin and Tim on the same team: \\(\\frac{2}{9}\\)\n- Expected number: \\(\\frac{2}{9} \\times 252 = 56\\)\n\nThis matches our combinatorial approach, so I'm confident in the result.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Steps: Ensuring the Correctness of the Approach**\n\n**Re-examining the Problem:**\n\n- **Total Unique Teams:** 252\n- **Teams per Unique Match-Up:** Each team plays once, so all unique teams are covered.\n- **Inclusion of Both Justin and Tim:** Calculated correctly through both combinatorial and probability methods.\n\n**Check for Overlaps or Misses:**\n\n- **Overlapping Teams:** Each team is unique and plays once, so there's no overlap in counting.\n- **Multiple Seasons Consideration:** The problem specifies a single semester, so only one occurrence of each team is considered.\n\n**Potential Mistakes:**\n\n- **Misunderstanding the Sampling Method:** The problem states that **each possible match-up occurs once**, which implies all unique five-player combinations are accounted for without repetition.\n\n- **Combinatorial Calculation Check:** \n  \\[\n  \\binom{8}{3} = 56\n  \\]\n  This confirms that exactly 56 teams include both Justin and Tim.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies and ensuring consistency across different approaches, the number of times Justin played in the same game as Tim is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{56}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Brainstorming Helped:** Initially considering different strategies allowed me to verify the correctness of the combinatorial approach by cross-checking with the probability method.\n  \n- **Checking Along the Way:** Regular checks ensured that my calculations were on track, catching potential missteps early.\n  \n- **Consistency is Key:** Both methods arriving at the same number reinforced the validity of the solution.\n\nOverall, approaching the problem step-by-step, reflecting frequently, and being open to adjusting strategies led to a confident and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Each game has 5 players. The games that we are counting include Justin, Tim, and 3 of the 8 other players. There are $\\binom{8}{3}$ = 56 such match-ups.\n\n\nAlternatively, There are $\\binom{10}{5}$ = 252 different possible match-ups involving 5 of the 10 players. By symmetry, every player plays in exactly half of them, 126 games. In each of the 126 games that Tim plays, he plays with 4 of the other 9 players. Again by symmetry, he plays with each of those 9 players in 4/9 of his games. So he plays against Justin in 4/9 of 126 games, or $\\boxed{56}$ games."
