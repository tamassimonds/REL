Each team plays each of the other teams in its own division twice and every team in the other division once. How many conference games are scheduled?*\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Total Teams:** 12 (6 in each division)\n  \n- **Intra-Division Games:** Each team plays every other team in its division **twice**.\n\n- **Inter-Division Games:** Each team plays every team in the other division **once**.\n\n**First Reaction:**\n\n- *This looks like a combination problem involving both home-and-away games within divisions and single games against the opposite division. It reminds me of scheduling problems I've encountered before.*\n\n- *Maybe I can calculate the total games for both intra- and inter-division separately and then add them up.*\n\n- *But wait, should I consider doubling the games since each game has two teams? Or is that already accounted for in the \"twice\" part?*\n\n**Checking Understanding:**\n\n- *I need to ensure that each game is counted only once in the total, even though each team plays multiple times.*\n\n- *Perhaps calculating the total games per division first would help clarify the approach.*\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Calculate Intra-Division Games First**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Calculate how many games are played within each division by considering every team plays every other team twice.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Sounds straightforward. But then, for each game between two teams, do I need to worry about double-counting since each game has two participants?\n\n**Strategy 2: Calculate Intra-Division Games Using Combinations**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Use combinations to find the number of unique matchups within a division and then multiply by 2 for the home-and-away games.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This might avoid double-counting issues since combinations inherently consider unique pairs.\n\n**Strategy 3: Calculate Total Games by Considering All Matchups Directly**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Directly calculate the total number of games by considering both intra-and inter-division matchups without separately handling home-and-away.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This seems simplistic but might lead to overcounting. I need to be careful here.\n\n**Choosing a Starting Point:**\n\n- **Decision:**  \n  Let's start with **Strategy 1**, calculating intra-division games straightforwardly. If that seems off, I can pivot to combinations or consider a different approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Intra-Division Games**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Each division has **6 teams**.\n  \n- Each team plays every other team in its division **twice**.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Total unique matchups within a division:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Matchups} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15\n  \\]\n  \n- Since each matchup occurs **twice** (home and away):\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Intra-Division Games} = 15 \\times 2 = 30 \\text{ games per division}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Total Intra-Division Games for Both Divisions:**\n  \n  \\[\n  30 \\times 2 = 60\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- *That seems logical. By using combinations, I've avoided double-counting each matchup.*\n\n- *But let's quickly check if this makes sense:*\n\n  - Each of the **6 teams** plays **5 others** *twice*: \\(6 \\times 5 \\div 2 = 15\\)\n  \n  - Multiplying by **2** for home-and-away: \\(15 \\times 2 = 30\\)\n  \n  - Multiplying by **2** for both divisions: \\(30 \\times 2 = 60\\)\n\n- *This check confirms the correctness of the approach.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Inter-Division Games**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Each team plays **every team in the other division once**.\n  \n- There are **6 teams** in each division, so each team in one division plays **6** games against the other division.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Total inter-division matchups per team:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Inter-Division Games per Team} = 6\n  \\]\n  \n- Total inter-division games for all teams:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Inter-Division Games} = 12 \\times 6 = 72\n  \\]\n  \n  *(Wait, but each game involves two teams, so I've counted each game twice. I need to divide by 2.)*\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Correct Total Inter-Division Games} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- *Initially, I overcounted by considering each team's matches independently without accounting for the pairings.*\n\n- *Dividing by **2** corrects this, ensuring each game is counted only once.*\n\n- *This matches the expectation: Each of the **36** inter-division games involves two teams.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Total Conference Games Scheduled**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Total Games = Intra-Division Games + Inter-Division Games**\n  \n  \\[\n  60 \\text{ (intra-division)} + 36 \\text{ (inter-division)} = 96\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- *The total of **96** games seems reasonable considering both intra-and inter-division matchups.*\n\n- *To double-check:*\n\n  - **Intra-Division:** 60 games\n  \n  - **Inter-Division:** 36 games\n  \n  - **Total:** 60 + 36 = 96\n\n- *Everything adds up nicely.*\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- *By calculating intra-division games using combinations, I avoided double-counting.*\n\n- *For inter-division games, recognizing the need to divide by **2** ensured each matchup was counted once.*\n\n- *Adding both totals gives a sensible and accurate count of **96** conference games.*\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Total Conference Games Scheduled:** **96**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Brainstorming Different Strategies:**  \n  Explored calculating games directly, using combinations, and considering home-and-away setups. Started with the simplest approach and adjusted as needed.\n\n- **Step-by-Step Calculations:**  \n  Handled intra-and inter-division games separately to avoid overcounting.\n\n- **Checking and Reflecting:**  \n  Throughout, I checked each step to ensure accuracy, adjusting strategies when initial thoughts led to overcounting.\n\n- **Final Verification:**  \n  Summed both game totals to confirm the correctness, leading to a final answer of **96** games.\n\n---\n\n**Final Note:**\n\n- *Just like solving a real problem, brainstorming various strategies, reflecting on their validity, and being open to adjusting the approach were key to arriving at the correct solution.*\n\n- *I hope this detailed, human-like walkthrough helps in understanding how to tackle such scheduling problems methodically.*",
