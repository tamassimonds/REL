    "working_out": "**Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. At first glance, the question deals with a right-angled triangle where the sum of the squares of the three side lengths is 1800. I\u2019m trying to figure out the length of the hypotenuse.\n\n**Natural Reactions:**\n- **Wait a second\u2026** Right-angled triangles remind me of the Pythagorean theorem, which relates the sides of such triangles. But this problem involves the sum of squares, not just the relationship between the legs and the hypotenuse.\n- **Hmm, maybe I need to\u2026** Think about how the Pythagorean theorem works: \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), where \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse. But here, we have all three sides squared and added together, which is slightly different.\n- **Oh! This looks similar to\u2026** Problems involving the sum of squares often hint at properties of Pythagorean triples or perhaps even the relationship between different types of triangles.\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Pythagorean Theorem Approach:**\n   - **Thinking it through:** Use \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) and see how it relates to \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1800\\).\n   - **Reflecting:** Wait, if \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), then \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2c^2\\). But here, \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1800\\). So, perhaps \\(2c^2 = 1800\\) leads to \\(c^2 = 900\\).\n\n2. **Assuming a Pythagorean Triple:**\n   - **Idea:** Perhaps the triangle is a Pythagorean triple, where the sides are integers that satisfy the sum of squares.\n   - **Checking:** If so, could \\(c\\) be related to well-known triples?\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation:**\n   - **Thinking:** Maybe set up equations based on the Pythagorean theorem and solve for the unknowns.\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...**\n\n\u2014I\u2019m getting \\(c^2 = 900\\), which means \\(c = 30\\). But let me double-check: if \\(2c^2 = 1800\\), then \\(c^2 = 900\\), so \\(c = 30\\). This seems too clean, but perhaps it's correct.\n\n**Thinking it Over:**\n\n- **Let me think about whether this approach makes sense:** If \\(c = 30\\), then \\(a^2 + b^2 = 30^2 = 900\\). That fits the Pythagorean theorem, but does it satisfy the original condition \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1800\\)?\n\n- **Quick Check:** \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 900 + 900 = 1800\\). It checks out!\n\n**Ah-ha Moment:**\n\n\u2014So, by assuming that \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), I arrived at \\(c = 30\\), which satisfies both the Pythagorean theorem and the given condition. \n\n**Alternative Approach**\n\n**Thinking:** Just to be sure, let me consider if there\u2019s another method to arrive at the same solution.\n\n- **Assuming \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1800\\) and \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\):**\n   - Substitute \\(c^2\\) with \\(a^2 + b^2\\) in the original equation:\n     \\[a^2 + b^2 + (a^2 + b^2) = 1800\\]\n     \\[2(a^2 + b^2) = 1800\\]\n     \\[a^2 + b^2 = 900\\]\n   \n- **Then, \\(c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 900\\), so \\(c = 30\\).**\n\n**Check Again:**\n\n\u2014This alternative approach also leads to \\(c = 30\\). It\u2019s consistent.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n\u2014Both strategies converge to the same solution. This suggests that the approach is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution Recap**\n\n1. **Recognized the Pythagorean Theorem:** \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\).\n2. **Applied to Given Condition:** \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1800\\).\n3. **Derived \\(2c^2 = 1800\\):** Leading to \\(c^2 = 900\\).\n4. **Calculated \\(c = 30\\):** The length of the hypotenuse.\n5. **Verified Consistency:** Both approaches yield the same result, satisfying all conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse of the triangle is **30 units**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThrough brainstorming and exploring different strategies, checking and reflecting on each step, and verifying the consistency of the solution, I arrived at the length of the hypotenuse being 30 units. This method ensured that the approach was correct and aligned with the given conditions.",

  "ground_truth": "Suppose the side lengths of the triangle are $a$, $b$, and $c$, with $c$ the hypotenuse. Then $c^2 = a^2+b^2$ by the Pythagorean Theorem. We are told that $$a^2+b^2+c^2 = 1800.$$ Since $a^2+b^2=c^2$, then $c^2 + c^2 = 1800$ or $2c^2 = 1800$ or $c^2 = 900$ or $c=30$ (since the side lengths are positive). So the hypotenuse has length $\\boxed{30}$."
