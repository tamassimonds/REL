    "working_out": "### Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. The question states that the line \\( x = k \\) intersects the parabola \\( x = -2y^2 - 3y + 5 \\) at exactly one point. We need to find the value of \\( k \\).\n\n**First Impressions:**\n- **Vertical Line:** The equation \\( x = k \\) represents a vertical line. This means that for a specific value of \\( k \\), the line intersects the parabola.\n- **Parabola's Orientation:** Looking at the parabola \\( x = -2y^2 - 3y + 5 \\), I notice it's a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\) with the coefficient of \\( y^2 \\) being negative. This suggests the parabola opens to the left.\n- **Single Intersection Point:** For the line to intersect the parabola at exactly one point, \\( k \\) must be such that the line is tangent to the parabola. This implies that the equation derived from setting \\( x = k \\) equal to the parabola's equation should have exactly one solution for \\( y \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Tangency Condition:** It reminds me of problems where the condition for tangency leads to a quadratic equation having a discriminant of zero. This would ensure that there's exactly one point of intersection.\n- **Alternative Approaches:** I could solve for \\( y \\) by setting the equations equal and then examining the resulting quadratic equation. Another way might be to analyze the vertex of the parabola and see how it relates to the line \\( x = k \\).\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Set the Equations Equal:** Solve \\( k = -2y^2 - 3y + 5 \\) to find \\( y \\) in terms of \\( k \\).\n2. **Use the Discriminant Method:** Ensure that the quadratic equation formed has a discriminant of zero for an exact single solution.\n3. **Graphical Insight:** Consider the shape of the parabola and the effect of varying \\( k \\) to visually determine the condition for tangency.\n4. **Vertex Analysis:** Determine the \\( x \\)-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola and see if \\( k \\) equals this value.\n\n**Wait a Moment:**\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, ensuring the discriminant is zero is a standard method for confirming that a quadratic equation has a single solution, which aligns with the requirement for a single intersection point.\n\n### Step 1: Setting Up the Equation\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's start by equating the two expressions for \\( x \\) to find the relationship between \\( k \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n**Equation Setup:**\n\\[ \nk = -2y^2 - 3y + 5 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Is This Correct?** This makes sense because setting \\( x = k \\) equal to the parabola's equation will give us the points of intersection.\n\n### Step 2: Rearranging the Equation\n\n**Action:**\nRearrange the equation to standard quadratic form.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \n-2y^2 - 3y + (5 - k) = 0 \n\\]\n\\[ \n2y^2 + 3y + (k - 5) = 0 \n\\] \n*(Multiplying by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive)*\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does This Help?** Yes, now it's in the standard form \\( Ay^2 + By + C = 0 \\), which is ideal for analyzing the discriminant.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Discriminant Condition\n\n**Thought Process:**\nFor the quadratic equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero.\n\n**Discriminant Formula:**\nFor \\( Ay^2 + By + C = 0 \\),\n\\[ \n\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC \n\\]\nSo,\n\\[ \n(3)^2 - 4(2)(k - 5) = 0 \n\\]\n\\[ \n9 - 8(k - 5) = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check Calculation:**\n  \\[ \n  9 - 8k + 40 = 0 \n  \\]\n  \\[ \n  49 - 8k = 0 \n  \\]\n  \\[ \n  8k = 49 \n  \\]\n  \\[ \n  k = \\frac{49}{8} \n  \\]\n- **Does This Make Sense?** This value of \\( k \\) should make the line \\( x = k \\) tangent to the parabola, meaning there should be exactly one point of intersection.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Solution\n\n**Action:**\nLet's quickly verify that \\( k = \\frac{49}{8} \\) indeed results in a single intersection point.\n\n**Check:**\n- Substitute \\( k = \\frac{49}{8} \\) back into the quadratic equation:\n  \\[ \n  2y^2 + 3y + \\left(\\frac{49}{8} - 5\\right) = 0 \n  \\]\n  \\[ \n  2y^2 + 3y + \\left(\\frac{49}{8} - \\frac{40}{8}\\right) = 0 \n  \\]\n  \\[ \n  2y^2 + 3y + \\frac{9}{8} = 0 \n  \\]\n- Compute the discriminant:\n  \\[ \n  \\Delta = (3)^2 - 4(2)\\left(\\frac{9}{8}\\right) \n  \\]\n  \\[ \n  \\Delta = 9 - 9 = 0 \n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Does the Discriminant Equal Zero?** Yes, the discriminant is zero, confirming that there is exactly one solution for \\( y \\).\n- **Is the Approach Correct?** The steps followed align with the method for ensuring tangency between a line and a parabola.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe value of \\( k \\) for which the line \\( x = k \\) intersects the parabola \\( x = -2y^2 - 3y + 5 \\) at exactly one point is:\n\\[ \n\\boxed{\\frac{49}{8}} \n\\]\n\n### Final Reflection\n\n- **Check Your Work:** Throughout each step, I ensured the calculations were correct and that the discriminant condition was properly applied.\n- **Confirm the Strategy:** Using the discriminant to determine the condition for tangency was an effective approach.\n- **Alternative Methods:** Although vertex analysis or graphical insights could provide additional confirmation, the discriminant method directly addresses the problem's requirement.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nBy systematically setting up the equation, applying the discriminant condition, and verifying the solution, we arrived confidently at the value of \\( k \\). This approach ensured that all possibilities were considered, and any potential errors were caught early through reflection and checking.",

  "ground_truth": "The line $x = k$ intersects the graph of the parabola $x = -2y^2 - 3y + 5$ at exactly one point if and only if the equation $-2y^2 - 3y + 5 = k$ has exactly one real solution.
