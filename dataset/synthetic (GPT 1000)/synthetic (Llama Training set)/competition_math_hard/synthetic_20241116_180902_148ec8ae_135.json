    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and approach it just as I would if I were solving it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my progress, and check my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's start with understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, it involves Juan's stamp collection organized by **country** and **decade**. Each stamp has a specific **cost** associated with its country, and I see a table with numbers representing the **quantity of stamps** per decade.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Countries:** Brazil, France, Peru, Spain\n- **Decades:** 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s\n- **Cost per Stamp by Country:**\n  - Brazil: 6 cents each\n  - France: 6 cents each\n  - Peru: 4 cents each\n  - Spain: 5 cents each\n- **Goal:** Determine the total cost in dollars and cents of **South American** stamps issued **before the 70s**.\n\n**Immediate Thoughts:**\n- **South American Countries:** Brazil and Peru are in South America, so I only need to consider their costs.\n- **Decades Before the 70s:** This includes the 50s and 60s.\n\n**Potential Strategies:**\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost for Each Decade Separately:** Multiply the number of stamps by the cost per stamp for both Brazil and Peru in the 50s and 60s, then sum these totals.\n2. **Simplify by Grouping Decades Together:** Since we're only dealing with two decades and two countries, perhaps there's a way to group the calculations to make it easier.\n3. **Use Percentages or Fractions to Estimate:** Since exact numbers seem manageable, perhaps this isn't necessary.\n\nAt this point, calculating the total cost for each decade separately seems straightforward. However, I might reconsider if the calculations become too cumbersome or if there's a more efficient method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Set Up the Calculation for the 50s**\n\n**Approach:**  \nLet's start by calculating the total cost for the **50s** stamps from Brazil and Peru.\n\n**Given Data for the 50s:**\n- **Brazil:** 4 stamps\n- **Peru:** 6 stamps\n\n**Cost per Stamp:**\n- Brazil: 6 cents\n- Peru: 4 cents\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Brazil:**\n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ stamps} \\times 6 \\text{ cents/stamp} = 24 \\text{ cents}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Peru:**\n  \\[\n  6 \\text{ stamps} \\times 4 \\text{ cents/stamp} = 24 \\text{ cents}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth calculations seem correct. Adding the costs for Brazil and Peru in the 50s gives us:\n\\[\n24 \\text{ cents} + 24 \\text{ cents} = 48 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\nThis looks reasonable, so I'll move to the next decade.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost for the 60s**\n\n**Approach:**  \nNow, let's do the same for the **60s** stamps.\n\n**Given Data for the 60s:**\n- **Brazil:** 7 stamps\n- **Peru:** 4 stamps\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Brazil:**\n  \\[\n  7 \\text{ stamps} \\times 6 \\text{ cents/stamp} = 42 \\text{ cents}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Peru:**\n  \\[\n  4 \\text{ stamps} \\times 4 \\text{ cents/stamp} = 16 \\text{ cents}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAgain, both calculations seem correct. Adding the costs for Brazil and Peru in the 60s:\n\\[\n42 \\text{ cents} + 16 \\text{ cents} = 58 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\nThis also looks reasonable. Let\u2019s proceed to combine the totals from both decades.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Totals from the 50s and 60s**\n\n**Approach:**  \nAdd the total costs from the 50s and 60s to get the overall expenditure for South American stamps before the 70s.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n48 \\text{ cents} + 58 \\text{ cents} = 106 \\text{ cents}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n106 cents is the total cost in cents. Since the problem asks for the answer in dollars and cents, let's convert this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Convert Cents to Dollars and Cents**\n\n**Approach:**  \nConvert 106 cents into dollars and cents.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n106 \\text{ cents} = 1 \\text{ dollar} \\, 6 \\text{ cents} \\quad (\\text{since } 100 \\text{ cents} = 1 \\text{ dollar})\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis conversion seems straightforward. Looking at the original question, the answer should be in dollars and cents format, so $1.06 is correct.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n\\[\n1 \\text{ dollar} \\, 6 \\text{ cents} \\, (\\text{or } \\$1.06) \\text{ matches the total of } 106 \\text{ cents}.\n\\]\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Revisiting the Approach:**  \nWhile the step-by-step method provided an accurate answer, I wonder if there\u2019s a more efficient way to handle such problems, especially under exam conditions where time is crucial.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Use a Table for Quick Visualization**\n\nPerhaps setting up a table to organize the calculations could streamline the process. This way, I can visually separate different decades and countries, making it easier to ensure all data is accounted for without getting mixed up.\n\n**Table Setup:**\n\n| Country | 50s Stamps | 60s Stamps | Cost per Stamp | Total Cost (Cents) |\n|---------|------------|------------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| Brazil  | 4          | 7          | 6 cents         |                     |\n| Peru    | 6          | 4          | 4 cents         |                     |\n| **Total** |            |            |                 | **106**             |\n\n**Calculations Using the Table:**\n\n- **For Brazil:**\n  - 50s: \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\) cents\n  - 60s: \\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\) cents\n  - **Total:** \\(24 + 42 = 66\\) cents\n  \n- **For Peru:**\n  - 50s: \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\) cents\n  - 60s: \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) cents\n  - **Total:** \\(24 + 16 = 40\\) cents\n  \n- **Grand Total:** \\(66 + 40 = 106\\) cents\n\n**Reflection:**  \nUsing a table simplifies the organization of data and ensures that all calculations are neatly aligned with their respective country and decade. This method also reduces the chances of misadding totals.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nWhether using the step-by-step approach or the table method, the total cost remains consistent at 106 cents, which converts to $1.06. This confirms the accuracy of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically calculating the total cost of South American stamps issued before the 70s\u2014first for the 50s, then the 60s, and finally combining both totals\u2014I arrived at the answer of **$1.06**. Reflecting and checking each step ensured the correctness of the solution. Additionally, contemplating an alternative table-based strategy helped streamline the process and verify the accuracy efficiently. Always keeping an eye on the format requested (dollars and cents) ensured the final answer was presented correctly.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\$1.06}\n\\]\n\nI hope this human-like exploration, with brainstorming, reflections, and checks, mirrors a natural problem-solving journey. If anything seems off, please let me know, and I can reassess the approach!",
