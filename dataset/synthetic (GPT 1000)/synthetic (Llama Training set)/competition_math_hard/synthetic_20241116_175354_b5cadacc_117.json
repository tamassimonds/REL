    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk you through my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would naturally tackle any problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, it reminds me of recursive functions or compositions of functions that I've encountered before. The function \\( r(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\theta} \\) looks like a simple rational function. Applying it multiple times makes me think of iterating transformations.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Understand the Function:**\n   - This is a function that takes an input \\( \\theta \\) and transforms it by taking the reciprocal of \\( 1 - \\theta \\).\n   - The operation is repeated six times, starting from \\( \\theta = 30 \\).\n\n2. **Possible Strategies:**\n   - **Direct Computation:** Apply the function step by step, keeping track of each iteration.\n   - **Look for Patterns or Invariants:** Maybe the function has a repeating cycle or a predictable pattern after a few applications.\n   - **Algebraic Simplification:** See if applying the function multiple times simplifies into a different form.\n   - **Graphical Insight:** Though not required, visualizing might help understand the transformations.\n\n3. **Check for Simple Cases:**\n   - Maybe start with fewer iterations (e.g., \\( r(r(30)) \\)) to see how the function behaves.\n\n**Wait a moment...** Let me reflect. Starting with a simpler case could provide insights into the pattern or behavior of multiple iterations. So, I'll consider calculating \\( r(30) \\) and then \\( r(r(30)) \\) to see what's happening.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Compute \\( r(30) \\)**\n\nLet's apply the function once:\n\n\\[\nr(30) = \\frac{1}{1 - 30} = \\frac{1}{-29}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, the result is a negative fraction, \\( \\frac{1}{-29} \\). That seems straightforward. The function simply takes the reciprocal of \\( 1 - 30 \\).\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, taking the reciprocal of a negative number yields another negative number. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Compute \\( r(r(30)) \\)**\n\nNow, let's apply \\( r \\) again, using the result from Step 1:\n\n\\[\nr\\left(\\frac{1}{-29}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{-29}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{29}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{30}{29}} = \\frac{29}{30}\n\\]\n\n**Wait...** That seems interesting. We've moved from a negative fraction to a positive fraction.\n\n**Check:** Let me verify the calculations:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{29} = \\frac{29}{29} + \\frac{1}{29} = \\frac{30}{29}\n\\]\n\nAnd then taking the reciprocal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{30}{29}} = \\frac{29}{30}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** It looks correct. The transformation flipped the sign and changed the denominator. This might be a hint that the function has some symmetry or periodicity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Look for Patterns**\n\nNow, I'm curious if there's a repeating pattern. Let's try \\( r(r(r(30))) \\):\n\n\\[\nr\\left(\\frac{29}{30}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{29}{30}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{30}} = 30\n\\]\n\n**Hmm...** Wait a moment. Applying \\( r \\) three times has brought us back to the original value, 30.\n\n**Aha!** This suggests that applying \\( r \\) three times returns to the starting point. It implies that \\( r(r(r(\\theta))) = \\theta \\). This is interesting and hints at a cyclical behavior.\n\n**Check:** Let me verify the calculation step by step:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{29}{30} = \\frac{1}{30}\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{30}} = 30\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Yes, it checks out. Applying \\( r \\) three times brings us back to the original value. This suggests that the function \\( r \\) has a period of 3.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Leveraging the Pattern**\n\nGiven that applying \\( r \\) three times returns to the original value, we can infer that applying \\( r \\) six times will also return to the original value:\n\n\\[\nr(r(r(r(r(r(30)))))) = 30\n\\]\n\n**Wait...** This seems too straightforward. Let me double-check to ensure this pattern holds.\n\n**Check:** I already verified that \\( r(r(r(30))) = 30 \\). Extending this, applying \\( r \\) three more times (totaling six) should also return to 30, as the applications repeat every three iterations.\n\n**Reflection:** The pattern holds. Since \\( r \\) has a period of 3, applying it six times brings us back to the starting point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nBased on the pattern observed, the result of applying \\( r \\) six times starting from 30 is:\n\n\\[\nr(r(r(r(r(r(30)))))) = 30\n\\]\n\n**Check:** To confirm, I briefly re-apply the pattern:\n\n- \\( r(30) = \\frac{1}{-29} \\)\n- \\( r(r(30)) = \\frac{29}{30} \\)\n- \\( r(r(r(30))) = 30 \\)\n- \\( r(r(r(r(30)))) = \\frac{1}{-29} \\)\n- \\( r(r(r(r(r(30)))))) = \\frac{29}{30} \\)\n- Finally, \\( r(r(r(r(r(r(30))))))) = 30 \\)\n\n**Wait...** Repeating the pattern confirms that after six applications, we're back at 30.\n\n**Reflection:** Everything checks out. The cyclical nature of the function \\( r \\) makes it efficient to determine the result by recognizing the pattern rather than computing each step exhaustively.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, starting with basic calculations, and then identifying a repeating pattern, we've determined that applying the function \\( r \\) six times to the initial value of 30 returns us to the original value:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{30}\n\\]\n\nThroughout this process, I reflected often, checked my work, and adjusted my approach as needed\u2014just like a human would naturally think through and solve a problem.",

Indeed, $r(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{1-\\theta}$, so \\begin{align*}\nr(r(\\theta)) &= r\\left(\\frac{1}{1- \\theta}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{1-\\theta}} \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\theta}{1 - \\theta} \\\\ &= \\frac{1 - \\theta}{1 - \\theta - 1} = \\frac{1 - \\theta}{- \\theta} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\theta}.\n\\end{align*} Then, $$r(r(r(\\theta ))) = r\\left(1 - \\frac 1{\\theta}\\right) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\left(1 - \\frac 1{\\theta}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac {1}{\\theta}} = \\theta.$$ Hence, for any $\\theta$, we have that $r(r(r(\\theta))) = \\theta$ is the identity.
