    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and make sure to check my work as I go, just like I would when solving it manually.\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst off, let's really **understand what the problem is asking**.\n\n- The question mentions finding the **determinant of the matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\)**, which represents **projection onto the vector** \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -7 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n- **My initial thought**: This looks like a problem involving projection matrices, which are used in linear algebra to project vectors onto a certain subspace.\n\n- **Brainstorming**: I remember that projection matrices have specific properties, and their determinants can be particularly interesting. Maybe I need to recall how such matrices are constructed or look for a formula related to their determinants.\n\n- **I'm not entirely sure** where to start\u2014perhaps by recalling how projection matrices are formed or exploring different strategies like using eigenvalues or properties of determinants.\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Recall the Formula for Projection Matrices**\n\n- **Thought Process**: I vaguely remember that the matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) for projecting onto a vector can be constructed using that vector. Maybe I can use the formula:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{P} = \\frac{\\mathbf{a} \\mathbf{a}^T}{\\|\\mathbf{a}\\|^2}\n  \\]\n  \n  where \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is the vector onto which we're projecting.\n\n- **Calculations**: Let's denote \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -7 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\|\\mathbf{a}\\|^2 = 4^2 + (-7)^2 = 16 + 49 = 65\n  \\]\n  \n  So,\n\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{P} = \\frac{1}{65} \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -7 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -7 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{65} \\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -28 \\\\ -28 & 49 \\end{pmatrix}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection**: This seems like a solid start. But before proceeding, let me **double-check** if this formula is correct.\n\n- **Quick Check**: The formula for the projection matrix looks familiar. **Wait, let me think**\u2014is \\(\\frac{\\mathbf{a} \\mathbf{a}^T}{\\|\\mathbf{a}\\|^2}\\) indeed the correct way to construct \\(\\mathbf{P}\\)? Yes, I recall it's used to create an orthogonal projection matrix.\n\n**Strategy 2: Eigenvalues Approach**\n\n- **Alternative Thought**: Another way to find the determinant of a projection matrix is by looking at its eigenvalues. I remember that the determinant is the product of eigenvalues.\n\n- **Brainstorming**: But to find eigenvalues, I would need to compute \\(\\mathbf{P} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}\\) and solve for \\(\\lambda\\). This might be more complicated than just calculating the determinant directly from the matrix.\n\n- **Realization**: Perhaps this isn't the most straightforward approach for this specific problem, especially since I already have a matrix form.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Determinant Using Stratagy 1**\n\n**Proceeding with Strategy 1**: Now that I have the projection matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\), let's calculate its determinant.\n\n- **Matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\)**: \n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{P} = \\frac{1}{65} \\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -28 \\\\ -28 & 49 \\end{pmatrix}\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculating Determinant**:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\det(\\mathbf{P}) = \\frac{1}{65} \\times \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -28 \\\\ -28 & 49 \\end{pmatrix}\n  \\]\n  \n  **But wait...** I should remember a property of projection matrices: **the determinant of an orthogonal projection matrix is either 0 or 1**, depending on whether the projection reduces the dimensionality of the space.\n\n- **Checking This Property**:\n  \n  - Since we're projecting onto the vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -7 \\end{pmatrix}\\), which is a single vector, the projection reduces the space to 1 dimension.\n  \n  - **Therefore**, the determinant should be **1**, as the matrix represents a rank-1 projection.\n\n- **But I'm not entirely certain**. Let me **double-check** my calculation to ensure it's consistent with this property.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Determinant Calculation**\n\n**Calculating the Determinant of the Matrix Inside \\(\\mathbf{P}\\)**:\n\n- **Matrix**:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\begin{pmatrix} 16 & -28 \\\\ -28 & 49 \\end{pmatrix}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Determinant Calculation**:\n  \n  \\[\n  16 \\times 49 - (-28) \\times (-28) = 784 - 784 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion**: Oh no! The determinant of the inner matrix is **0**.\n\n- **Reflection**: But wait\u2014**based on my earlier realization**, the determinant of a projection matrix onto a line should be **0** if the line does not pass through the origin or if the matrix reduces the space by at least one dimension.\n\n- **Checking Again**: Since we're projecting onto a single vector, which does pass through the origin, the projection should indeed have a **determinant of 0**.\n\n- **Ahh!** This aligns with the property: **the determinant of a projection matrix that projects onto a subspace of lower dimension than the ambient space is zero**.\n\n### **Step 4: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Final Thoughts**:\n\n- Initially, I thought the determinant might be 1 based on the property of projections reducing dimensionality. However, after calculating the determinant of the inner matrix, it's clear that the determinant is **0**.\n\n- **Reflection**: This makes sense because projecting onto a line (1-dimensional subspace) in a 2-dimensional space results in a matrix that has a rank of 1, leading to a determinant of 0.\n\n- **Checking Consistency**: Both approaches\u2014calculating \\(\\det(\\mathbf{P})\\) directly and considering the properties of projection matrices\u2014agree that the determinant is **0**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying calculations, and reflecting on properties of projection matrices, **the determinant of the matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) is** \\(\\boxed{0}\\). \n\nThis aligns with the expectation that projecting onto a line in a higher-dimensional space results in a determinant of zero, indicating that the matrix reduces the dimensionality by at least one.",
