    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a human's thought process with brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I notice the following key points:\n\n- **Interior Angles of a Convex Polygon:** I recall that the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon is determined by its number of sides (\\(n\\)).\n  \n- **Given Sum:** The problem states that this sum is 1800 degrees for a polygon with \\(n\\) sides.\n\n- **Objective:** Find the sum of the interior angles for a polygon with \\(n + 2\\) sides.\n\nThis reminds me of a formula I\u2019ve encountered before: the sum of interior angles in a polygon depends on \\(n\\), specifically \\(180(n - 2)\\). If I remember correctly, adding two sides to the polygon should increase the sum of the interior angles accordingly. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Use the Formula for Sum of Interior Angles:** I think about using the formula \\(180(n - 2)\\) to relate the sum of angles to the number of sides. This seems like a direct approach.\n  \n- **Check the Given Information:** Since the sum is already provided as 1800, I can set up an equation to find \\(n\\).\n\n- **Alternative Methods:** Perhaps there\u2019s another way to approach this, like recognizing patterns or using properties of polygons, but the formula method seems straightforward.\n\n**Reflection:** \n\n- Does using the formula make sense? Yes, because it directly ties the number of sides to the sum of interior angles.\n\n- Is there another method? Maybe, but the formula approach is familiar and reliable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Formula**\n\nGiven the sum of interior angles is 1800 degrees for a polygon with \\(n\\) sides, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of Interior Angles} = 180(n - 2)\n\\]\n\nSo, setting up the equation:\n\n\\[\n180(n - 2) = 1800\n\\]\n\nThis looks straightforward. **Wait**, let me verify if this equation is correct.\n\n**Check:** \n\n- The formula \\(180(n - 2)\\) should equal the given sum of 1800. \n- Simplifying, \\(180 \\times (n - 2) = 1800\\), which seems correct.\n\n**Conclusion:** The equation is set up properly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving for \\(n\\)**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll solve for \\(n\\):\n\n\\[\nn - 2 = \\frac{1800}{180}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\nn - 2 = 10\n\\]\n\nAdding 2 to both sides:\n\n\\[\nn = 12\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does \\(n = 12\\) make sense?** Yes, because it fits the equation \\(180(n - 2) = 1800\\).\n  \n- **Check the multiplication:** \\(180 \\times (12 - 2) = 180 \\times 10 = 1800\\). The numbers align perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Sum of Interior Angles for \\(n + 2\\) Sides**\n\nNow that I know \\(n = 12\\), I need to find the sum of interior angles for a polygon with \\(n + 2 = 14\\) sides.\n\nUsing the same formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of Interior Angles} = 180(n - 2)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(n = 14\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 180(14 - 2) = 180 \\times 12\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 2160 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick multiplication check:** \\(180 \\times 10 = 1800\\), \\(180 \\times 2 = 360\\), so \\(1800 + 360 = 2160\\). This seems correct.\n  \n- **Does this approach make sense?** Yes, because adding two sides increases the sum of interior angles proportionally.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\nLet me briefly pause and verify if everything aligns:\n\n- **Original Equation:** \\(180(n - 2) = 1800\\) led to \\(n = 12\\).\n  \n- **Sum for \\(n + 2\\) Sides:** Calculated as \\(180(n - 2)\\) with \\(n = 14\\), resulting in 2160 degrees.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is the increase logical?** Adding two sides to a polygon should increase the sum of interior angles by \\(180 \\times 2 = 360\\) degrees. Let's check:\n\n  - Sum for \\(n = 12\\): 1800 degrees.\n  - Adding 360 degrees: \\(1800 + 360 = 2160\\) degrees.\n  \n  This matches our earlier calculation, so everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Pattern Recognition**\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n\n- **Can I find a pattern?** I remember that each additional side adds 180 degrees to the sum of interior angles.\n\n- **Testing this idea:** \n\n  - For \\(n = 10\\): Sum = \\(180 \\times (10 - 2) = 180 \\times 8 = 1440\\).\n  - For \\(n = 12\\): Sum = 1800 (given).\n  - **Difference:** \\(1800 - 1440 = 360\\) degrees, which is \\(180 \\times 2\\), aligning with the number of additional sides.\n\n- **Conclusion:** This pattern supports the original solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this confirm the correctness?** Yes, it reinforces that adding two sides increases the sum by 360 degrees.\n\n- **Is there a simpler way?** Recognizing the pattern simplifies the process, but the formula method is more formal and ensures accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Consistency with Polygon Properties**\n\n**Quick Recall:**\n\n- **Sum of interior angles formula:** \\(180(n - 2)\\) is well-established for polygons.\n\n- **For a 14-sided polygon:** \\(180 \\times (14 - 2) = 180 \\times 12 = 2160\\) degrees is consistent with the property that each additional side contributes 180 degrees to the sum.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is the final answer reasonable?** Yes, because it aligns with both the formula and the pattern recognition approach.\n\n- **Check against sample polygons:**\n\n  - **Hexagon (\\(n = 6\\)):** \\(180 \\times (6 - 2) = 720\\) degrees.\n  - **Dodecagon (\\(n = 12\\)):** \\(180 \\times (12 - 2) = 1800\\) degrees (given).\n  - **Tetradecagon (\\(n = 14\\)):** \\(180 \\times (14 - 2) = 2160\\) degrees.\n\nEverything matches up perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe degree measure of the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with \\(n + 2\\) sides is **2160 degrees**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBy systematically applying the formula for the sum of interior angles and verifying each step, including alternative approaches and pattern recognition, I ensured the accuracy of the solution. Checking computations along the way and reflecting on the reasoning helped catch any potential mistakes early, leading to a confident and correct final answer.",
