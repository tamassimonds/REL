    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, simulating human-like brainstorming, reflecting, and checking along the way. I'll ensure to show my thought process, explore different strategies, and correct myself if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst thoughts:\n\nOkay, the problem asks us to square each integer \\( n \\) within the range \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 10 \\) and then find the remainders when these squares are divided by \\( 11 \\). After that, we need to add up all the **distinct** remainders and call that sum \\( m \\). Finally, we have to determine the quotient when \\( m \\) is divided by \\( 11 \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Brainstorm 1:** This seems like a modular arithmetic problem. I remember dealing with remainders and squaring numbers in a similar context before.\n- **Brainstorm 2:** Maybe I can calculate the squares first and then find their remainders individually.\n- **Brainstorm 3:** Alternatively, perhaps there's a property of numbers modulo \\( 11 \\) that can simplify the process, like recognizing patterns or using symmetry.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI'm leaning towards calculating the squares and their remainders directly because the range is small. But I'll keep the second strategy in mind in case things get messy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Squares**\n\nThoughts:\n\nLet's start by squaring each integer from \\( 1 \\) to \\( 10 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1^2 & = 1 \\\\\n2^2 & = 4 \\\\\n3^2 & = 9 \\\\\n4^2 & = 16 \\\\\n5^2 & = 25 \\\\\n6^2 & = 36 \\\\\n7^2 & = 49 \\\\\n8^2 & = 64 \\\\\n9^2 & = 81 \\\\\n10^2 & = 100 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, I have the squares now. This part seems straightforward. Next, I'll find the remainders when these squares are divided by \\( 11 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding Remainders Modulo 11**\n\nThoughts:\n\nNow, I'll calculate each square's remainder when divided by \\( 11 \\). This will help identify the distinct remainders needed for the sum.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1^2 & = 1 \\quad (\\text{remainder } 1) \\\\\n2^2 & = 4 \\quad (\\text{remainder } 4) \\\\\n3^2 & = 9 \\quad (\\text{remainder } 9) \\\\\n4^2 & = 16 \\quad (\\text{remainder } 5) \\\\\n5^2 & = 25 \\quad (\\text{remainder } 3) \\\\\n6^2 & = 36 \\quad (\\text{remainder } 3) \\\\\n7^2 & = 49 \\quad (\\text{remainder } 5) \\\\\n8^2 & = 64 \\quad (\\text{remainder } 9) \\\\\n9^2 & = 81 \\quad (\\text{remainder } 4) \\\\\n10^2 & = 100 \\quad (\\text{remainder } 1) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n\nWait, I see that multiple squares yield the same remainder. For instance, \\( 6^2 \\) and \\( 5^2 \\) both give a remainder of \\( 3 \\). This suggests that the distinct remainders are fewer than ten.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis aligns with my initial thought\u2014perhaps there's a pattern or property I'm not fully utilizing yet. Maybe considering the remainders more strategically would help.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Distinct Remainders**\n\nThoughts:\n\nFrom the calculations, the distinct remainders are \\( 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 \\). I need to ensure all distinct values are accounted for before proceeding to sum them.\n\n**List of Distinct Remainders:**\n\n\\[\n\\{ 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 \\}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, I expected more distinct remainders initially, but I see that some remainders repeat due to the properties of modular arithmetic. This makes sense because squaring numbers can produce recurring patterns in remainders.\n\n**Brainstorm 4:** Maybe squaring a number \\( n \\) and \\( 11 - n \\) results in the same remainder because \\( (11 - n)^2 \\equiv n^2 \\mod 11 \\). This could explain the repetitions.\n\n**Checking:**\n\nLet\u2019s verify this. For instance:\n\n- \\( 5^2 \\equiv 3 \\mod 11 \\)\n- \\( 6^2 \\equiv 3 \\mod 11 \\)\n  \nBoth \\( 5 \\) and \\( 6 \\) are symmetric around \\( 5.5 \\), so their squares give the same remainder.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Summing the Distinct Remainders**\n\nThoughts:\n\nNow, I'll add up all the distinct remainders to find \\( m \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nm = 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 9 = 22\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems straightforward. Adding up the distinct remainders gives me \\( m = 22 \\). I\u2019ll proceed to the next step to find the quotient when \\( m \\) is divided by \\( 11 \\).\n\n**Checking:**\n\nWait, let me double-check the addition:\n\n\\[\n1 + 3 = 4 \\\\\n4 + 4 = 8 \\\\\n8 + 5 = 13 \\\\\n13 + 9 = 22\n\\]\n\nYep, the addition is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the Quotient \\( \\frac{m}{11} \\)**\n\nThoughts:\n\nFinally, I need to divide \\( m = 22 \\) by \\( 11 \\) and find the quotient.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{22}{11} = 2 \\quad (\\text{quotient } 2)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe quotient is \\( 2 \\). This checks out since \\( 22 \\) divided by \\( 11 \\) evenly goes \\( 2 \\) times.\n\n**Checking:**\n\nLet me quickly verify:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 2 = 22\n\\]\n\nYes, the multiplication confirms the quotient is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nThroughout this problem:\n\n- **Strategy Exploration:** I started by calculating the squares directly, which seemed straightforward given the small range. Initially, I considered looking for patterns but proceeded with direct computation to ensure clarity.\n  \n- **Identifying Patterns:** Noticing that many squares share the same remainders helped streamline the process by reducing the number of distinct values to sum.\n  \n- **Mistake and Correction:** At first, I didn't account for repeated remainders, but upon reflection, I recognized the symmetry in modular arithmetic, which explained the duplicates.\n\n- **Final Checks:** Throughout the steps, I consistently checked calculations, ensuring each part made sense before proceeding.\n\nIn the end, the quotient when \\( m \\) is divided by \\( 11 \\) is \\( \\boxed{2} \\).",
