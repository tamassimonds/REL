    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just as I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, exploring where I might go wrong, and checking my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n* \"The length of a rectangle is increased by \\(25\\%\\), but the width is decreased to keep the area unchanged. By what percent was the rectangle's width decreased?\"\n\nMy initial reaction is to think about how changes in length and width affect the area of a rectangle. It reminds me of problems involving proportional changes and maintaining a constant product. \n\nI recall that for a rectangle, **Area = Length \u00d7 Width**. If the area remains unchanged despite a change in length, the width must adjust accordingly. This seems like a problem involving percentage increases and decreases, where maintaining equality in the area constrains the relationship between the new length and width.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure yet\u2014maybe there's a more straightforward way or something I'm missing. Let's explore different strategies to see what fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Algebraic Approach:**\n   - Use equations to represent the original and new dimensions.\n   - Set up an equation based on the area remaining constant.\n\n2. **Percentage Change Calculation:**\n   - Calculate the new length as a percentage of the original.\n   - Determine how much the width needs to decrease to keep the area unchanged.\n\n3. **Proportional Relationships:**\n   - Use the concept that the product of length and width remains constant.\n   - Set up a proportion to find the percentage decrease in width.\n\n4. **Visual/Geometric Interpretation:**\n   - Think about the geometric implications of increasing length and decreasing width.\n\nI'm leaning towards the **Algebraic Approach** because it seems straightforward\u2014setting up equations will give a clear relationship between the new and old dimensions. But let's proceed and see if it works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define Variables and Set Up the Equation**\n\nLet's denote:\n\n* Original Length = \\(L\\)\n* Original Width = \\(W\\)\n* Original Area = \\(A = L \\times W\\)\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\n* The length is increased by \\(25\\%\\), so the new length \\(L_{\\text{new}} = L \\times 1.25\\).\n* The width is decreased to keep the area unchanged, so we need to find the new width \\(W_{\\text{new}}\\).\n\n**Equation Based on Area Remaining Constant:**\n\n\\[\nL_{\\text{new}} \\times W_{\\text{new}} = A\n\\]\n\\[\n1.25L \\times W_{\\text{new}} = L \\times W\n\\]\n\nAt this point, it seems like a logical starting point. But let's double-check to ensure we're setting the right relationship.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Checking**\n\n**Does this make sense?**\n\n* Yes, we're equating the new area (with increased length and decreased width) to the original area, which is correct.\n* The equation simplifies the relationship between \\(W_{\\text{new}}\\) and \\(W\\).\n\n**Potential Issue:**\n\n* Wait, I should ensure the decrease in width is correctly calculated as a percentage, not just as a multiplicative factor.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplify the Equation to Find \\(W_{\\text{new}}\\)**\n\nNow, let's solve for \\(W_{\\text{new}}\\):\n\n\\[\n1.25L \\times W_{\\text{new}} = L \\times W\n\\]\n\nFirst, divide both sides by \\(L\\) (assuming \\(L \\neq 0\\)):\n\n\\[\n1.25 \\times W_{\\text{new}} = W\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by \\(1.25\\):\n\n\\[\nW_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{W}{1.25}\n\\]\n\nThis tells us that the new width is \\(\\frac{W}{1.25}\\), meaning the width is reduced to \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) of the original width.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n* Does \\(\\frac{W}{1.25} = \\frac{4}{5}W\\)? \n* Yes, because \\(\\frac{1}{1.25} = 0.8\\), which is \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\).\n\nThis seems correct. But to express the width decrease as a percentage, let's proceed to the next step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Decrease in Width**\n\nWe know:\n\n\\[\nW_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{4}{5}W\n\\]\n\nSo, the width is reduced to \\(80\\%\\) of the original width. Therefore, the percentage decrease is:\n\n\\[\n100\\% - 80\\% = 20\\%\n\\]\n\n**Does this align with expectations?**\n\n* Initially, I expected the decrease to be around \\(20\\%\\), but I want to verify the calculation to be sure.\n* Let me cross-check: Reducing \\(W\\) to \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) means reducing it by \\(\\frac{1}{5}W\\), which is \\(20\\%\\).\n\nThis confirms that the width is indeed reduced by \\(20\\%\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Final Check**\n\n**Is the approach correct?**\n\n* By setting up the equation based on constant area, simplifying to find \\(W_{\\text{new}}\\), and calculating the percentage decrease, the approach seems robust.\n* I briefly considered if there might be an error in assuming the relationship between length and width, but given the constant area condition, it holds.\n\n**Quick Reality Check:**\n\n* Does reducing the width by \\(20\\%\\) balance the \\(25\\%\\) increase in length while keeping the area constant? \n* Yes, multiplying a \\(1.25\\) increase in length by a \\(0.8\\) decrease in width gives:\n\n\\[\n1.25 \\times 0.8 = 1.0\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the area remains unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, setting up the correct relationship based on the constant area, and verifying each step, the percentage decrease in the rectangle's width is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20\\%}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThroughout the process, I started by defining the problem, brainstorming various approaches, and choosing the one that seemed most straightforward. I continually checked my work to ensure each step made sense and aligned with the problem's requirements. By reflecting on each stage, I was able to confirm the correctness of the solution and arrive at the final answer confidently.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the original area be $x$. Since the area of the rectangle is length multiplied by width, increasing the length of a rectangle by 25 percent increases the area to $1.25x$. We need to multiply this area by some number $y$ to decrease it back to $x$. We have the equation $1.25xy=x\\Rightarrow y=1/1.25=.8$. So the width needs to be decreased to $.8$ times of the original in order to change the area back to the original area. Thus, the width needs to be adjusted $\\boxed{20}$ percent."
