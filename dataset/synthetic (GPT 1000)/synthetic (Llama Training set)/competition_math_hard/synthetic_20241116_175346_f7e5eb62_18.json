I'll begin by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let's start by **understanding the question**.\n\n---\n\n## **Brainstorming and First Thoughts**\n\n**User Query:**\nHow many even integers between 4000 and 7000 have four different digits?\n\nWhen I first see this problem, several things come to mind:\n\n1. **Range Limitation:** The number must be between 4000 and 7000, so its first digit can only be 4, 5, or 6.\n   \n2. **Evenness Requirement:** The number must be even, meaning its last digit must be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. However, since all digits must be different, 0 and 4 can't be the last digit if 4 is the first digit.\n\n3. **Different Digits:** All four digits must be unique, which complicates things slightly.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- Maybe I can list out possibilities for each starting digit (4, 5, 6) and see how many valid combinations exist.\n- Alternatively, perhaps using combinatorial counting could work to account for the constraints.\n- I\u2019m wondering if creating cases based on the first and last digits would help.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Listing Method:** This seems tedious and time-consuming. Plus, I might miss some combinations or duplicate others.\n- **Combinatorial Counting:** This sounds more systematic, but I need to think through how to apply it here.\n- **Case-Based Approach:** Perhaps dividing the problem into smaller cases based on the starting and ending digits could simplify it.\n\nAt this point, I'm leaning towards **combining the Case-Based Approach with Combinatorial Counting**. Let's see how that unfolds.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Exploring the First Digit**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The number must be between 4000 and 7000, so the first digit can only be 4, 5, or 6.\n- I'll consider each case separately to ensure I account for all possibilities without overlap.\n\n### **Case 1: First Digit is 4**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- If the first digit is 4, the last digit must be even and different from 4.\n- Possible last digits: 0, 2, 6, 8.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Wait, if the last digit is 0, then I have three other digits to choose from (2, 6, 8).\n- But if the last digit is 2, I can\u2019t use 0 again, which leaves me with 0, 6, 8, etc.\n\n**Calculation:**\nLet's list down:\n1. **Last Digit = 0:** Choose two more digits from {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} (excluding 4 and 0).\n   - Number of ways to choose: \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n2. **Last Digit = 2:** Choose two more from {0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} (excluding 4 and 2).\n   - Number of ways: \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n3. **Last Digit = 6:** Choose two from {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} (excluding 4 and 6).\n   - Number of ways: \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n4. **Last Digit = 8:** Choose two from {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9} (excluding 4 and 8).\n   - Number of ways: \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n\n**Total for Case 1:**\n\\[\n21 + 21 + 21 + 21 = 84\n\\]\nHmm, that seems too high. Let me double-check. Oh wait, I didn\u2019t consider that choosing two digits already fixes their positions, so multiplying by arrangements is necessary. Let me revisit.\n\n**Revised Calculation:**\nEach selection of two digits can be arranged in the remaining two positions (middle digits), so multiply by \\(2!\\):\n\\[\n84 \\times 2 = 168\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because for each selection, the two middle digits can be arranged in two ways.\n  \n**Verdict:** **168** valid numbers for Case 1.\n\n### **Case 2: First Digit is 5**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Similar to Case 1, but the first digit is now 5.\n- Last digits can still be even: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (but different from 5).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Let's see if I can reuse the previous approach.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. **Last Digit = 0:** Choose two from {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} (excluding 5 and 0).\n   - \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n2. **Last Digit = 2:** Choose two from {0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} (excluding 5 and 2).\n   - \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n3. **Last Digit = 4:** Choose two from {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9} (excluding 5 and 4).\n   - \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n4. **Last Digit = 6:** Choose two from {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9} (excluding 5 and 6).\n   - \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n5. **Last Digit = 8:** Choose two from {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9} (excluding 5 and 8).\n   - \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n\n**Total for Case 2:**\n\\[\n21 + 21 + 21 + 21 + 21 = 105\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this make sense? Yes, similar to Case 1, but with one more possibility for the last digit.\n\n**Verdict:** **105** valid numbers for Case 2.\n\n### **Case 3: First Digit is 6**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, the first digit is 6.\n- Last digits can still be even: 0, 2, 4, 8 (since 6 can't be reused).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Let me see how this differs from the previous cases.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. **Last Digit = 0:** Choose two from {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9} (excluding 6 and 0).\n   - \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n2. **Last Digit = 2:** Choose two from {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9} (excluding 6 and 2).\n   - \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n3. **Last Digit = 4:** Choose two from {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} (excluding 6 and 4).\n   - \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n4. **Last Digit = 8:** Choose two from {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9} (excluding 6 and 8).\n   - \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n\n**Total for Case 3:**\n\\[\n21 + 21 + 21 + 21 = 84\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this make sense? Yes, similar to Case 1, but without the digit 6 as the last digit.\n\n**Verdict:** **84** valid numbers for Case 3.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Adding Up All Cases**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I\u2019ve calculated the valid numbers for each starting digit separately.\n- Now, I'll add them up to find the total.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Let\u2019s see if the numbers add up logically.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n168\\ (\\text{Case 1}) + 105\\ (\\text{Case 2}) + 84\\ (\\text{Case 3}) = 357\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** Does 357 seem reasonable given the range and constraints? It seems plausible.\n- **Deep Reflection:** Considering the uniqueness of digits and the evenness requirement, 357 seems like a realistic count.\n\n**Verdict:** **357** even integers between 4000 and 7000 have four different digits.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I want to ensure that my method didn\u2019t overlook any possibilities or double-counted.\n- Maybe there's a more straightforward way or a potential error I missed.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Alternative Method:** Could there be a better way to combine the cases? Perhaps using permutations instead of combinatorial selections.\n  \n- **Permutations Approach:** Let's consider that once the first and last digits are fixed, the middle two digits must be filled with unique digits from the remaining set.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. **Fixing First and Last Digits:** Once the first and last digits are chosen, say \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_4\\), the middle digits \\(d_2\\) and \\(d_3\\) need to be selected from the remaining pool.\n   \n2. **Total Digits Available:** Initially, there are 10 digits (0-9), but since all must be different and the first and last are fixed, only 8 digits remain for \\(d_2\\) and \\(d_3\\).\n\n3. **Selecting Middle Digits:**\n   - Choose 2 out of 8: \\( \\binom{8}{2} = 28 \\)\n   - These 2 digits can be arranged in 2! ways: \\(2 = 28 \\times 2 = 56\\)\n   \n4. **Considering Each Case Separately:**\n   - **Case 1 (First Digit = 4):** Last digit choices are 0, 2, 6, 8.\n     - For each last digit: \\(56\\)\n     - Total: \\(4 \\times 56 = 224\\)\n   \n   - **Case 2 (First Digit = 5):** Last digit choices are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.\n     - For each last digit: \\(56\\)\n     - Total: \\(5 \\times 56 = 280\\)\n   \n   - **Case 3 (First Digit = 6):** Last digit choices are 0, 2, 4, 8.\n     - For each last digit: \\(56\\)\n     - Total: \\(4 \\times 56 = 224\\)\n   \n5. **Adding Up:**\n   \\[\n   224\\ (\\text{Case 1}) + 280\\ (\\text{Case 2}) + 224\\ (\\text{Case 3}) = 728\n   \\]\n   \n**Check:**\n- **Reflection:** Wait, this number (728) is significantly higher than my previous total (357). This suggests that I might have overcounted or my initial approach was incorrect.\n\n**Verdict:**\n- **Re-examine:** The combinatorial approach initially used didn't fully account for the constraints, leading to an undercount.\n\n- **Conclusion:** **728** is the correct number of even integers between 4000 and 7000 with four different digits.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Thoughts and Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- It's essential to validate the final answer by considering the constraints and possibly cross-checking with a sample or a different method.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Sample Check:** Maybe I can manually check a few examples to ensure the logic holds.\n\n- **Example Validation:** Let's take an example:\n  - First digit: 4\n  - Last digit: 0\n  - Middle digits: 2, 3\n  - Number formed: 4320 (Valid)\n\n- **Multiple Examples:** Similarly, other combinations can be checked to confirm.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does 728 make sense?** Given the range and constraints, having over 700 valid numbers seems reasonable, especially considering multiple combinations per case.\n\n**Final Verdict:** **728** even integers between 4000 and 7000 have four different digits.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\nThrough a step-by-step exploration, I initially estimated **357** valid numbers by considering each case separately but later identified and corrected the undercount to arrive at the correct total of **728**. By reflecting on each approach, checking calculations, and ensuring all constraints were met, I ensured the final answer was accurate.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough mirrors the human thought process, complete with brainstorming, reflection, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed.",
