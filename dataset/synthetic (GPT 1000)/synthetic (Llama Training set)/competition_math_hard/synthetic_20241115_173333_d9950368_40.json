    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, mimicking the natural thought process of exploring different strategies, reflecting, checking work, and being open to changing approaches when needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, it reminds me of concepts related to centroids and transformations in geometry. Here\u2019s what comes to mind:\n\n- **Centroid Calculation**: I know that the centroid (geometric center) of a polygon is the average of the coordinates of its vertices. This makes me think that the sum of the coordinates plays a crucial role here.\n\n- **Transformation of Polygons**: The problem involves creating new polygons by taking midpoints of sides. This feels similar to geometric transformations, where such operations might preserve certain properties like centroids.\n\n- **Iterative Process**: Since this is a three-step process (from \\( P_1 \\) to \\( P_3 \\)), I wonder if there's a cumulative effect on the sums of the coordinates.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how these thoughts connect. Let\u2019s brainstorm a bit more.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculating Centroids**:\n   - Maybe find the centroid of \\( P_1 \\) and see how it relates to \\( P_2 \\) and \\( P_3 \\).\n   \n2. **Analyzing Midpoints**:\n   - Look at how taking midpoints affects the sums of the coordinates.\n\n3. **Geometric Properties**:\n   - Explore if there are known properties of polygons that relate the sums of coordinates through transformations.\n\n4. **Algebraic Approach**:\n   - Set up equations relating the sums of \\( x \\)-coordinates at each step.\n\nI think starting with the **Centroid Calculation** makes sense because the centroid involves averaging the coordinates, which seems directly related to the sums given. If that doesn't work out, I can shift to analyzing midpoints more closely or consider an algebraic approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Centroid of \\( P_1 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The centroid \\( C \\) of a polygon is the average of the coordinates of its vertices.\n- Given that the sum of the \\( x \\)-coordinates of \\( P_1 \\) is 2009, I can find the centroid's \\( x \\)-coordinate \\( x_C \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Total \\( x \\)-coordinate sum of \\( P_1 \\): 2009\n- Number of vertices: 100\n- Average \\( x \\)-coordinate (i.e., \\( x_C \\)):\n  \\[\n  x_C = \\frac{2009}{100} = 20.09\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This makes sense because the centroid is the average, so dividing the total sum by the number of vertices is straightforward.\n- I\u2019ll keep this \\( x \\)-coordinate of the centroid in mind as I move forward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Centroid of \\( P_2 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- \\( P_2 \\) is formed by the midpoints of the sides of \\( P_1 \\).\n- I wonder if the centroid of \\( P_2 \\) aligns with the centroid of \\( P_1 \\). If the transformation doesn\u2019t affect the centroid, the \\( x \\)-coordinate should remain the same.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Since the midpoints of the sides preserve the average \\( x \\)-coordinate, the centroid of \\( P_2 \\) should also have an \\( x \\)-coordinate of 20.09.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does this make sense?**\n  - Yes, because taking midpoints is a linear transformation that doesn\u2019t alter the average position of the set of points.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This approach seems correct so far. The centroid remains unchanged through this midpoint transformation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Centroid of \\( P_3 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- \\( P_3 \\) is formed by the midpoints of the sides of \\( P_2 \\).\n- Continuing the same reasoning, the centroid of \\( P_3 \\) should also have an \\( x \\)-coordinate of 20.09.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Again, the centroid\u2019s \\( x \\)-coordinate remains 20.09.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Is this always true?**\n  - Yes, applying a linear transformation (midpoints) sequentially doesn't change the average position of the vertices.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This consistency reinforces that the centroid concept is correctly applied here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Does relying solely on centroids cover all cases?**\n  - Initially, it seems sufficient because midpoints preserve centroids. However, to be thorough, perhaps considering the impact on the sums of \\( x \\)-coordinates directly would add confidence.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Analyzing \\( x \\)-Coordinate Sums**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Instead of focusing only on centroids, examine how the sum of \\( x \\)-coordinates changes (or doesn\u2019t) through each transformation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n1. **Sum of \\( x \\)-Coordinates for \\( P_1 \\)**:\n   - Given as 2009.\n\n2. **Sum for \\( P_2 \\)**:\n   - Each side's midpoint is taken, implying the sum of midpoints involves averaging segments.\n   - However, since we're only considering \\( x \\)-coordinates and each side's midpoint is involved in two sides, the sum might remain unchanged.\n   - Let\u2019s calculate: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Sum of } x\\text{-coordinates for } P_2 = \\frac{2009}{2} \\times \\text{number of sides} = \\frac{2009}{2} \\times 100 = 100,450 \\text{ (incorrect)}\n     \\]\n     *Wait, this number seems too large because...*\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Oops, that can't be right**. I divided the sum by 2, but each side contributes its midpoint, which is already an average. This implies that the sum should remain proportional to the number of sides but divided accordingly.\n\n**Revised Calculation:**\n- Each midpoint \\( x \\)-coordinate contributes half the sum per side. Therefore, summing all midpoints results in:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Sum for } P_2 = \\frac{2009}{100} \\times 100 = 2009\n  \\]\n- Similarly, \\( P_3 \\) sum should also be 2009.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does this align with the centroid approach?**\n  - Yes, both methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Having both methods agree** increases confidence in the correctness. It suggests that regardless of the approach, the sum of the \\( x \\)-coordinates remains 2009 through each transformation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n- The sum of the \\( x \\)-coordinates of the vertices of \\( P_3 \\) is **2009**.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- **Checking Consistency**: Both the centroid-based approach and the alternative sum analysis confirm the same result.\n- **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initial miscalculation prompted revisiting the strategy, ensuring the sum remains constant through transformations.\n- **Confidence Level**: High, because multiple methods lead to the same conclusion, and the geometric properties align with mathematical expectations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Importance of Multiple Strategies**: Exploring different approaches helped catch and correct an initial error.\n- **Value of Reflection**: Regularly checking and reflecting on each step ensured that the solution path was correct.\n- **Final Checking**: Always worth confirming that various methods converge to the same answer, enhancing confidence in the solution's validity.\n\nBy writing it out step-by-step, including brainstorming, reflections, and checking, I've mimicked a human-like thought process, capturing both the journey and the destination.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_1$ be $x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_{100}$.  Then, by the midpoint formula, the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_2$ are $\\frac{x_1+x_2}2,\\frac{x_2+x_3}2,\\ldots,\\frac{x_{100}+x_1}2 $.  The sum of these equals $\\frac{2x_1+2x_2+\\cdots +2x_{100}}2=x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_{100}$.
