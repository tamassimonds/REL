    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll try to approach it just like I would if I were solving it on paper, thinking out loud, making mistakes, and reflecting along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Okay, the problem involves two variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), which are always positive.\n- It mentions that \\(x^2\\) and \\(y\\) vary inversely. This makes me think of inverse variation, which I've seen before.\n- I'm given a specific condition: when \\(x\\) is 2, \\(y\\) is 10.\n- I need to find \\(x\\) when \\(y\\) is 4000.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Inverse Variation:** I know that if two quantities vary inversely, their product is a constant. So, maybe I can set up an equation based on this.\n- **Given Point:** With \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 10\\), I can find that constant.\n- **Find \\(x\\):** Once I have the constant, I can use it to find \\(x\\) when \\(y = 4000\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This approach seems logical. But let me double-check if inverse variation applies here.\n- **Wait a sec:** In the problem, it's stated that \\(x^2\\) and \\(y\\) vary inversely. So, my approach should involve \\(x^2\\), not just \\(x\\).\n\n**Correction:**\n\n- Okay, I need to adjust my thinking. Instead of just \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), I should consider \\(x^2\\) and \\(y\\) are inversely related.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- I'll proceed by setting up the inverse variation relationship between \\(x^2\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Inverse Variation Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Given that \\(x^2\\) and \\(y\\) vary inversely, I can write this as:\n  \\[\n  x^2 \\times y = k\n  \\]\n  where \\(k\\) is a constant.\n\n- From the problem, when \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 10\\), I can find \\(k\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Plugging in the given values:\n  \\[\n  (2)^2 \\times 10 = k \\\\\n  4 \\times 10 = k \\\\\n  k = 40\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait, so \\(k = 40\\). That makes sense because it satisfies the given condition.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Let me quickly verify: \\(2^2 = 4\\) and \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\). Yup, correct.\n\n**Natural Flow:**\n\n- Alright, now I have the constant \\(k\\). Time to use it to find \\(x\\) when \\(y = 4000\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\(x\\) When \\(y = 4000\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I know that \\(x^2 \\times y = k\\).\n- Given \\(y = 4000\\), I can substitute this into the equation and solve for \\(x^2\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Substitute \\(y = 4000\\) into the equation:\n  \\[\n  x^2 \\times 4000 = 40\n  \\]\n  \n- To find \\(x^2\\), divide both sides by 4000:\n  \\[\n  x^2 = \\frac{40}{4000} \\\\\n  x^2 = \\frac{1}{100}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Hmm, \\(x^2 = \\frac{1}{100}\\). Let me think about this.\n- Taking the square root should give me \\(x\\), but since \\(x\\) must be positive, I'll take the positive square root.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Does this make sense? \\(x^2 = \\frac{1}{100}\\) implies \\(x = \\frac{1}{10}\\). That seems reasonable.\n\n**Natural Flow:**\n\n- Alright, so \\(x = \\frac{1}{10}\\) when \\(y = 4000\\). Let's double-check to ensure everything aligns.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Before finalizing, it's always good to verify if the solution holds true in the original equation.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Let's plug \\(x = \\frac{1}{10}\\) and \\(y = 4000\\) back into the inverse variation equation:\n  \\[\n  x^2 \\times y = k \\\\\n  \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^2 \\times 4000 = 40 \\\\\n  \\frac{1}{100} \\times 4000 = 40 \\\\\n  40 = 40\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Perfect! Both sides of the equation are equal, so the solution is correct.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- The inverse variation relationship holds true with the values substituted back. No discrepancies.\n\n**Natural Flow:**\n\n- Everything checks out. The approach was correct, and the solution aligns with the given condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- Initially, I misinterpreted the problem by considering \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be inversely related instead of \\(x^2\\) and \\(y\\).\n- Once I recognized this, I set up the correct inverse variation equation and solved for \\(x\\) step by step.\n- Throughout the process, I reflected and checked my work to ensure the solution was accurate.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n- When \\(y = 4000\\), \\(x = \\frac{1}{10}\\).\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem this way, I ensured a thorough understanding, corrected initial misunderstandings, and verified the solution to confirm its correctness.",
