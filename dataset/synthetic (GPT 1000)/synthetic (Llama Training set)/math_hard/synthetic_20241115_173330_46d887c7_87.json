    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process step-by-step, exploring different strategies and reflecting often to ensure I'm on the right track. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Okay, so we're dealing with a triangle that has two sides of lengths 6 cm and 8 cm, and a right angle. \n- Right triangle... hmm, that reminds me of the Pythagorean theorem, which relates the lengths of the sides.\n- But wait, the question asks for the **shortest** possible length of the remaining side. That's interesting.\n\n**Initial Strategies:**\n- **Pythagorean Theorem:** This is my go-to for right triangles. It states that \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), where \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.\n- **Considering Different Scenarios:** Maybe the 6 cm and 8 cm sides are the legs, or perhaps one of them is the hypotenuse.\n- **Exploring Other Theorems:** Not sure if other theorems apply here since it's a right triangle...\n\n**Reflection:**\n- I think starting with the Pythagorean theorem makes sense because it directly relates to right triangles.\n- But I'm also curious if there's another approach to verify the answer later.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's assume both given sides (6 cm and 8 cm) are the legs of the triangle. The hypotenuse would then be the longest side.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n  \\[\n  a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n  \\]\n  where \\(a = 6\\) cm and \\(b = 8\\) cm.\n\n  \\[\n  6^2 + 8^2 = c^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  36 + 64 = c^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  100 = c^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  c = \\sqrt{100} = 10 \\text{ cm}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Wait, does this make sense? If the hypotenuse is 10 cm, then the two legs are 6 cm and 8 cm... that fits the Pythagorean theorem perfectly.\n- But hold on, the question asks for the **shortest** possible length of the remaining side. So, maybe I need to consider another scenario where one of the given sides is the hypotenuse.\n\n**Realization:**\n- Ah, I see. While the Pythagorean theorem gives me a consistent answer, the question's wording suggests that the remaining side could be shorter than 10 cm if one of the given sides is the hypotenuse.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering the Hypotenuse as a Given Side**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's explore the possibility where one of the given sides (6 cm or 8 cm) is the hypotenuse. This would mean the triangle is oriented differently.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Since the Pythagorean theorem applies regardless of which side is the hypotenuse, I'll set up the equation assuming the hypotenuse is 8 cm.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Assuming the hypotenuse \\(c = 8\\) cm and one leg \\(a = 6\\) cm, let's find the other leg \\(b\\).\n\n  \\[\n  a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  6^2 + b^2 = 8^2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  36 + b^2 = 64\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  b^2 = 64 - 36\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  b^2 = 28\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  b = \\sqrt{28} \\approx 5.29 \\text{ cm}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Hmm, this gives me a leg length of about 5.29 cm, which is shorter than 10 cm. This aligns with the question's requirement for the **shortest** possible remaining side.\n\n**Realization:**\n- Now it makes sense. By considering the 8 cm side as the hypotenuse, the remaining side can be about 5.29 cm, which is indeed shorter than 10 cm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I want to ensure that both scenarios (with 6 cm and 8 cm as legs) are considered and that the solution makes sense logically and mathematically.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Recheck the calculations and see if the Pythagorean theorem holds in both cases.\n\n**Verification:**\n- **Case 1:** 6 cm and 8 cm as legs:\n  \\[\n  6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 36 + 64 = 100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 100 = 100 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n  \\]\n- **Case 2:** 6 cm as a leg and 8 cm as the hypotenuse:\n  \\[\n  6^2 + b^2 = 8^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 36 + 28 = 64 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 64 = 64 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Both cases satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, so the approach is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- By considering both scenarios\u2014where the given sides are either both legs or one is the hypotenuse\u2014I ensured that the shortest possible remaining side is accurately calculated.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The shortest possible length of the remaining side of the triangle is **approximately 5.29 cm** when the 8 cm side is the hypotenuse.\n\n**Expressing in Centimeters to the Nearest Hundredth:**\n- So, the final answer is **5.29 cm**.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed step-by-step approach helps in understanding how to tackle such problems! By brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their validity, and verifying each step, we arrive at the correct solution confidently.",
