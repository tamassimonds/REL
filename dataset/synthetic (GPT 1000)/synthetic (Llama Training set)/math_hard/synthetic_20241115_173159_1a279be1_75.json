    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle the problem step by step, mimicking human thought processes with brainstorming, reflection, and checking along the way. \n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- **Initial Brainstorm:** The problem involves a train passing through a tunnel, with specific timings for the front and tail exiting. I need to determine the length of the tunnel.\n- **Familiarity:** This reminds me of problems involving relative speed and distance. I think I've dealt with train-and-tunnel problems before, but I might be mixing up concepts.\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure how to relate the train's length and the time it takes for the tail to exit to the tunnel's length. Maybe I need to visualize it better.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n- **Strategy 1: Relative Motion Approach**\n  - **Thought Process:** Perhaps considering the relative motion of the train and tunnel could help. The speed of the train relative to the tunnel might give me insights.\n  - **Potential Issue:** Wait, I remember that relative motion is more about two objects moving towards each other. Here, it's just one train passing through a tunnel.\n\n- **Strategy 2: Analyzing Distances and Times**\n  - **Thought Process:** Another approach is to break down the distances covered by the train's front and tail in relation to the tunnel. Maybe calculating how far the train travels in the given time could help.\n  - **Checking:** This seems more straightforward since I have the train's speed and the time difference.\n\n- **Strategy 3: Visualization with a Diagram**\n  - **Thought Process:** Drawing a diagram to visualize the train entering and exiting the tunnel might clarify the relationships between the train, tunnel, and time.\n  - **Reflection:** Visual aids often help in understanding; let's try sketching it out mentally.\n\n### **Proceeding with Strategy 2: Analyzing Distances and Times**\n\n**Step 1:** **Calculate the Distance Traveled by the Train in 3 Minutes**\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - **Speed of Train:** 60 miles per hour (mph)\n  - **Time Given:** 3 minutes\n  - **Convert Time to Hours:** \\( \\frac{3}{60} = 0.05 \\) hours\n  - **Distance Formula:** Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n    \\[\n    \\text{Distance} = 60 \\times 0.05 = 3 \\text{ miles}\n    \\]\n    \n- **First Check:** \n  - **Reflection:** That seems logical. In 3 minutes, at 60 mph, the train covers 3 miles. Does this make sense? Yes, because 60 mph means 1 mile per minute.\n\n**Step 2:** **Understanding the Train's Length and Its Relation to the Tunnel**\n\n- **Thought Process:** The train is 1 mile long. If the tail exits 3 minutes after the front, it means the entire train has passed through the tunnel during this time.\n- **Visualization:** The front of the train enters the tunnel, and once it's fully inside, it takes an additional 3 minutes for the tail to exit. So, the train covers its entire length plus the length of the tunnel in this time.\n\n**Step 3:** **Setting Up the Equation for Total Distance Traveled**\n\n- **Equation Setup:**\n  - **Total Distance Covered in 3 Minutes:** Length of the Train + Length of the Tunnel = 3 miles\n  - **Let\u2019s Define:** \n    - Length of the Tunnel = \\( L \\)\n    - Length of the Train = 1 mile\n    - **So,:** \\( 1 + L = 3 \\)\n    \n- **Solving for \\( L \\):**\n  \\[\n  L = 3 - 1 = 2 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n\n- **Second Check:**\n  - **Reflection:** This means the tunnel is 2 miles long. Does that seem reasonable? \n  - **Quick Check:** In 3 minutes, at 60 mph, the train covers 3 miles. If the train itself is 1 mile, the remaining 2 miles must be the tunnel. That adds up.\n\n### **Confirming the Approach**\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** \n  - **Does This Make Sense?** The total distance is the train passing through the tunnel completely, which includes both the train's length and the tunnel's length.\n  - **Re-examining the Steps:** Calculated the distance covered in 3 minutes, set up the equation correctly, and solved for the tunnel length. Everything checks out.\n\n- **Possible Overthinking:** \n  - **Thinking Out Loud:** Initially, I considered relative motion, but that wasn't needed. Focusing on the distance covered per time unit was the right approach.\n  - **Potential Mistake:** Mixing up the train's length with the tunnel's length could lead to confusion, but that was clarified in the equation setup.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Final Answer:** \n  - **Tunnel Length:** 2 miles\n- **Overall Process:** \n  - **Starting with Brainstorming:** Explored different strategies, settled on analyzing distances and times.\n  - **Step-by-Step Calculation:** Calculated the distance covered by the train in the given time, set up and solved the equation for the tunnel's length.\n  - **Checks Along the Way:** Confirmed each step made logical sense, ensuring the approach was correct.\n- **Key Takeaway:** \n  - **Importance of Strategy Selection:** Choosing the right approach (analyzing distances) was crucial to arriving at the correct solution.\n  - **Value of Reflection and Checking:** Regularly checking and reflecting ensured no mistakes went unnoticed, leading to a reliable answer.\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically, reflecting at each step, and verifying calculations, I confidently conclude that the tunnel is **2 miles long**.",

  "ground_truth": "Because the train is moving 60 miles per hour, the front of the train moves 1 mile every minute. Therefore, in the three minutes since the front of the train entered the tunnel, the front of the train has moved three miles. At the end of these three minutes, we know the front of the train is 1 mile beyond the end of the tunnel,because the train is one mile long and its tail is just leaving the tunnel.  So, the front of the train has moved 3 miles from the beginning of the tunnel and is now 1 mile beyond the end of the tunnel. This tells us that the tunnel is $3-1 = \\boxed{2\\text{ miles}}$ long."
