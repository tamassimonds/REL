So, solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) simultaneously makes sense.\n\n- **Possible Strategies**:\n  1. **Graphing**: Plot both equations on a graph to visually find the intersection.\n  2. **Algebraic Methods**:\n     - **Substitution**: Solve one equation for one variable and substitute it into the other.\n     - **Elimination**: Manipulate the equations to cancel out one variable and solve for the other.\n     - **Standard Form Adjustment**: Rewrite both equations in slope-intercept form or standard form to make comparison easier.\n\n- **Reflection**: Graphing seems like a good starting point for intuition, but I know it's not always precise without a graphing tool. Given that I need an exact answer, maybe starting with algebraic methods would be better. But, wait, would substitution or elimination be more straightforward here?\n\nHmm, looking at the equations, both are already somewhat arranged for substitution or elimination. **Substitution** might be easier since the first equation can be solved for \\(y\\) directly. Does that sound right? Let me try that first.\n\n## Step 1: Solving for \\(y\\) in the First Equation\n\n**Thought Process**: Let's take the first equation and solve for \\(y\\). This will help me substitute into the second equation later.\n\n\\[ \n2y = -x + 3 \n\\]  \n\n**Calculations**:   \n- Divide both sides by 2 to isolate \\(y\\):\n\n\\[ \ny = \\frac{-x + 3}{2} \n\\]  \n\n**Check**:  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, dividing both sides by 2 is correct to solve for \\(y\\). No issues here.\n\n## Step 2: Substituting \\(y\\) into the Second Equation\n\n**Reflection**: Now that I have \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\), I can substitute this expression into the second equation to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n\\[ \n-y = 5x + 1 \n\\]  \n\n**Calculations**:  \n- Substitute \\(y = \\frac{-x + 3}{2}\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ \n-\\left(\\frac{-x + 3}{2}\\right) = 5x + 1 \n\\]  \n\n- Simplify the left side:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{x - 3}{2} = 5x + 1 \n\\]  \n\n- **Reflection**: Wait, did I substitute correctly? Yes, negating \\(-y\\) gives \\(\\frac{x - 3}{2}\\). That seems right.\n\n## Step 3: Eliminate the Fraction\n\n**Thought Process**: Having a fraction can make calculations a bit messy. Let's eliminate it by multiplying both sides by 2.\n\n**Calculations**:  \n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\frac{x - 3}{2} = 2 \\cdot (5x + 1) \n\\]  \nSimplifies to:  \n\\[\nx - 3 = 10x + 2 \n\\]  \n\n**Check**:  \nMultiplying both sides by 2 should eliminate the fraction, and it looks like it worked. No mistakes here.\n\n## Step 4: Solving for \\(x\\)\n\n**Reflection**: Now, let's solve for \\(x\\) by bringing like terms together.\n\n**Calculations**:  \n\\[\nx - 3 = 10x + 2 \n\\]  \nSubtract \\(10x\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx - 10x - 3 = 2 \n\\]  \nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n-9x - 3 = 2 \n\\]  \nAdd 3 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n-9x = 5 \n\\]  \nDivide by \\(-9\\):\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{5}{9} \n\\]  \n\n**Reflection**:  \nThat seems reasonable. The \\(x\\)-value is a fraction, which can happen with line intersections.\n\n**Check**:  \nWait, let's quickly verify. Multiplying both sides by -9 should give me back to \\(x = -\\frac{5}{9}\\). Yup, that checks out.\n\n## Step 5: Finding the Corresponding \\(y\\)-Value\n\n**Thought Process**: Now that I have \\(x = -\\frac{5}{9}\\), I need to find the corresponding \\(y\\) by substituting back into the equation for \\(y\\).\n\n**Calculations**:  \n\\[\ny = \\frac{-(-\\frac{5}{9}) + 3}{2} \n\\]  \nSimplify the negative:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{\\frac{5}{9} + 3}{2} \n\\]  \nConvert 3 to a fraction with a common denominator:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{\\frac{5}{9} + \\frac{27}{9}}{2} \n\\]  \nAdd the fractions:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{\\frac{32}{9}}{2} \n\\]  \nDivide by 2:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{32}{18} = \\frac{16}{9} \n\\]  \n\n**Check**:  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, dividing \\(\\frac{32}{9}\\) by 2 gives \\(\\frac{16}{9}\\). The \\(y\\)-value is also a fraction, which is consistent.\n\n## Step 6: Writing the Intersection as an Ordered Pair\n\n**Thought Process**: Now that I have both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), the intersection point can be written as an ordered pair \\((x, y)\\).\n\n**Calculations**:  \n\\[\n\\left(-\\frac{5}{9}, \\frac{16}{9}\\right) \n\\]  \n\n**Reflection**:  \nThat looks correct. Both values are fractions and seem reasonable for an intersection point.\n\n## Step 7: Verifying the Solution\n\n**Thought Process**: It's always a good idea to double-check the solution by plugging these values back into the original equations to ensure they satisfy both.\n\n**Calculations**:  \nLet's substitute \\(x = -\\frac{5}{9}\\) and \\(y = \\frac{16}{9}\\) into both original equations.\n\n**First Equation**:  \n\\[\n2y = -x + 3 \n\\]  \nSubstitute \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n2 \\times \\frac{16}{9} = -(-\\frac{5}{9}) + 3 \n\\]  \nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{32}{9} = \\frac{5}{9} + \\frac{27}{9} \n\\]  \nAdd:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{32}{9} = \\frac{32}{9} \n\\]  \n**Second Equation**:  \n\\[\n-y = 5x + 1 \n\\]  \nSubstitute \\(y\\) and \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n-\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right) = 5 \\times (-\\frac{5}{9}) + 1 \n\\]  \nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{16}{9} = -\\frac{25}{9} + 1 \n\\]  \nConvert 1 to a fraction with a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{16}{9} = -\\frac{25}{9} + \\frac{9}{9} \n\\]  \nAdd:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{16}{9} = -\\frac{16}{9} \n\\]  \n**Check**:  \nBoth equations are satisfied with the values obtained. This confirms that the intersection point is correct.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter brainstorming and exploring different strategies, I decided to use the **substitution method**, which seemed straightforward given the structure of the equations. Here's a recap of the steps taken:\n\n1. **Solved for \\(y\\)**) in terms of \\(x\\) using the first equation.\n2. **Substituted \\(y\\)**) into the second equation to solve for \\(x\\).\n3. **Found \\(x\\)**) as \\(-\\frac{5}{9}\\).\n4. **Determined \\(y\\)**) by substituting \\(x\\) back into the equation for \\(y\\), yielding \\(\\frac{16}{9}\\).\n5. **Formulated the intersection point**) as \\(\\left(-\\frac{5}{9}, \\frac{16}{9}\\right)\\).\n6. **Verified the solution**) by plugging the values back into both original equations, confirming their validity.\n\nThroughout the process, I checked my work at each step to ensure accuracy, reflecting and adjusting my approach as needed. This iterative checking ensured that the final answer is correct.",

  "ground_truth": "To find the intersection, we must find the point satisfying both equations. Hence we must solve the system \\begin{align*}\n2y&=-x+3, \\\\\n-y&=5x+1.\n\\end{align*}Adding two times the second equation to the first, we get $2y+2(-y)=-x+3+2(5x+1)$, which simplifies to $0=9x+5$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=-\\frac{5}{9}$. Plugging this into the second equation above, we obtain $-y=5\\cdot -\\frac{5}{9}+1=-\\frac{16}{9}$. So the intersection is $\\boxed{\\left(-\\frac{5}{9}, \\frac{16}{9}\\right)}$."
