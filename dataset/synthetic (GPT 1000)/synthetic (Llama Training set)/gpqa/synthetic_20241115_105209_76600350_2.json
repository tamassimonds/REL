    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through each part as naturally as possible, just like how a human would approach it. I'll start by brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting, checking my work frequently, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Decomposition Reaction:** The question mentions that 49 g of KClO\u2083 decomposes, producing O\u2082. This reminds me of the decomposition reactions I've seen before, where potassium chlorate breaks down into potassium chloride and oxygen gas.\n\n- **Metals and Oxides:** The O\u2082 produced reacts with an impure metal (20% purity) to form a metal oxide. This suggests a metal reacting with oxygen, forming a metal oxide, which is a common reaction.\n\n- **Amphoteric Metals:** The metal is described as amphoteric and abundant in the Earth's crust. This hints at common amphoteric metals like aluminum (Al), zinc (Zn), or even lead (Pb). I recall that aluminum is one of the most abundant metals, which could be a clue.\n\n- **Carbon to Reduce Metal Oxide:** Finally, I need to determine how much carbon is needed to convert the metal oxide back to the pure metal. This indicates a reduction reaction where carbon reduces the metal oxide to the metal.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Decomposition of KClO\u2083:** I need to know the stoichiometry of this reaction to find out how much O\u2082 is produced.\n\n- **Identifying the Metal:** Based on purity and amphoteric nature, I should consider common metals like aluminum.\n\n- **Reduction with Carbon:** Once the metal oxide is identified and the amount is known, calculate how much carbon is required to reduce it back to the metal.\n\n- **Checking Purity:** The purity of the metal affects the calculations, so I need to account for that.\n\n**Initial Strategy:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Moles of O\u2082 Produced from KClO\u2083 Decomposition.**\n2. **Determine the Moles of the Impure Metal Used.**\n3. **Identify the Metal and Write the Reaction to Form Metal Oxide.**\n4. **Calculate the Moles of Metal Oxide Formed.**\n5. **Determine the Moles of Carbon Needed for Reduction.**\n6. **Find the Mass of Carbon Required.**\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**\n\n- **Wait a Moment:** Before proceeding, I should confirm if this makes sense. The decomposition of KClO\u2083 indeed produces O\u2082, which then reacts with the metal. The amphoteric nature and abundance hint towards aluminum.\n\n- **Reflection:** It seems like a logical approach, but I need to ensure each step is correctly linked, especially identifying the metal and the reduction reaction.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Moles of O\u2082 Produced**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Decomposition Reaction:** The balanced equation for the decomposition of potassium chlorate (KClO\u2083) is:\n  \n  \\[\n  2 \\, \\text{KClO}_3(s) \\rightarrow 2 \\, \\text{KCl}(s) + \\text{O}_2(g)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Stoichiometry:** From the equation, 2 moles of KClO\u2083 produce 1 mole of O\u2082.\n\n- **Given Mass of KClO\u2083:** 49 g of KClO\u2083 is decomposed.\n\n- **Need Molar Mass of KClO\u2083:** \n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Molar Mass of KClO}_3 = 39.1 \\, \\text{(K)} + 35.5 \\, \\text{(Cl)} + 3 \\times 16 \\, \\text{(O)} = 122.6 \\, \\text{g/mol}\n  \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Moles of KClO\u2083:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Moles of KClO}_3 = \\frac{49 \\, \\text{g}}{122.6 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.400 \\, \\text{mol}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Moles of O\u2082 Produced:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Moles of O}_2 = \\frac{0.400 \\, \\text{mol}}{2} = 0.200 \\, \\text{mol}\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Does This Seem Correct?** Yes, halving the moles of KClO\u2083 gives the moles of O\u2082, consistent with the stoichiometry.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Moles of Impure Metal Used**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Given Purity:** The metal used is 20% pure, meaning only 20% of the mass is the actual metal, and the rest is impurity.\n\n- **Given Mass of Impure Metal:** 10.8 g\n\n- **Need to Find the Mass of Pure Metal:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Mass of Pure Metal} = 10.8 \\, \\text{g} \\times 20\\% = 2.16 \\, \\text{g}\n  \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Moles of Metal:**\n\n  - **Assuming Aluminum (Al) as the Metal:**\n  \n    \\[\n    \\text{Molar Mass of Al} = 27.0 \\, \\text{g/mol}\n    \\]\n    \n    \\[\n    \\text{Moles of Al} = \\frac{2.16 \\, \\text{g}}{27.0 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.0800 \\, \\text{mol}\n    \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Reflection:** I assumed aluminum based on its abundance and amphoteric nature. Does the molar mass calculation align? Yes, the value seems reasonable for aluminum.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying the Metal and Writing the Reaction to Form Metal Oxide**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Amphoteric Metal:** Given that aluminum is initiatively considered, let's proceed under this assumption.\n\n- **Formation of Metal Oxide:**\n  \n  \\[\n  4 \\, \\text{Al}(s) + 3 \\, \\text{O}_2(g) \\rightarrow 2 \\, \\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3(s)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Stoichiometry of the Reaction:**\n\n  - 4 moles of aluminum react with 3 moles of O\u2082 to form 2 moles of Al\u2082O\u2083.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Align with Previous Steps?** The moles of O\u2082 available (0.200 mol) should be sufficient to react with the available aluminum (0.0800 mol) if aluminum is the metal.\n\n- **Check Stoichiometry:** Need to verify if the amount of O\u2082 is enough for the given aluminum.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating Moles of Metal Oxide Formed**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Using Stoichiometry:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{3 moles of O}_2 \\, \\text{react with 4 moles of Al to produce 2 moles of Al}_2\\text{O}_3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Moles of Al\u2082O\u2083 Produced:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Moles of Al}_2\\text{O}_3 = \\frac{0.0800 \\, \\text{mol Al} \\times 2}{4} = 0.0400 \\, \\text{mol}\n  \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Is the Calculation Correct?** Yes, using the ratio, the moles of Al\u2082O\u2083 produced align with the stoichiometry.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Seems Consistent:** The amounts calculated so far make sense. However, I need to ensure the final carbon requirement is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Determining the Moles of Carbon Needed for Reduction**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Reduction of Metal Oxide by Carbon:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3(s) + 3 \\, \\text{C}(s) \\rightarrow 2 \\, \\text{Al}(s) + 3 \\, \\text{CO}(g)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Stoichiometry of the Reduction:**\n  \n  - 1 mole of Al\u2082O\u2083 requires 3 moles of carbon to produce 2 moles of aluminum.\n\n- **Moles of Carbon Needed:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Moles of C} = 0.0400 \\, \\text{mol Al}_2\\text{O}_3 \\times \\frac{3 \\, \\text{mol C}}{1 \\, \\text{mol Al}_2\\text{O}_3} = 0.120 \\, \\text{mol C}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does the Amount of Carbon Seem Reasonable?** 0.120 mol is quite a bit, but given the scale of aluminum oxide being reduced, it seems plausible.\n\n- **Quick Calculation Check:** Converting moles of carbon to grams will be the next step to ensure compliance with the answer options.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Calculating the Mass of Carbon Required**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Molar Mass of Carbon (C):** 12.0 g/mol\n\n- **Mass of Carbon Needed:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Mass of C} = 0.120 \\, \\text{mol} \\times 12.0 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 1.44 \\, \\text{g}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is 1.44 g Correct?** This mass seems large compared to the options provided (0.72 g, 0.48 g, 0.36 g, 0.06 g).\n\n- **Check Calculation:** \n\n  \\[\n  0.120 \\, \\text{mol C} \\times 12.0 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 1.44 \\, \\text{g}\n  \\]\n  \n  This matches what I calculated earlier.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Identifying the Problem and Adjusting the Approach**\n\n**Realization:**\n\n- **Wait, that can't be right because...** The mass of carbon needed (1.44 g) doesn't match any of the provided options. This suggests that there might be an issue in the previous steps, particularly in how the aluminum oxide and the reduction process are being treated.\n\n**Re-evaluation:**\n\n- **Possible Oversight:** The purity of aluminum needs to be factored in correctly, and the stoichiometry involving carbon might require a closer look.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Let's verify each step again, especially focusing on the reduction reaction and the amount of carbon required.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Revisiting the Reduction and Carbon Calculation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Reexamining the Reduction Reaction:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3(s) + 3 \\, \\text{C}(s) \\rightarrow 2 \\, \\text{Al}(s) + 3 \\, \\text{CO}(g)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Moles of Al\u2082O\u2083 Produced Earlier:** 0.0400 mol\n\n- **Carbon Requirement per Mole of Al\u2082O\u2083:** \n\n  - According to the balanced equation, each mole of Al\u2082O\u2083 requires 3 moles of carbon.\n  \n- **Total Moles of Carbon Needed:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Moles of C} = 0.0400 \\, \\text{mol Al}_2\\text{O}_3 \\times 3 = 0.120 \\, \\text{mol C}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Mass of Carbon:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Mass of C} = 0.120 \\, \\text{mol} \\times 12.0 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 1.44 \\, \\text{g}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Again, 1.44 g:** The calculation aligns consistently, but the mass doesn't match the provided options.\n\n- **Possible Issue:** The problem might be in how the initial metal (aluminum) and its oxide are being treated concerning purity and reaction stoichiometry.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\n- **Consider the Purity of Aluminum:** Perhaps the impurities affect the amount of carbon required differently than initially assumed.\n\n- **Adjusting the Stoichiometry:**\n\n  - Reassess how the stoichiometry applies when dealing with an impure metal.\n  \n- **Assuming Complete Reaction:**\n\n  - Even with impurities, the reaction likely goes to completion, so the stoichiometry should still hold for the metal oxide and carbon reduction.\n\n**Checking This Approach:**\n\n- **Does It Make Sense?** By considering the 20% purity, the calculations earlier seem correct because only the pure metal participates in the reaction.\n\n- **Reflection:** If 1.44 g doesn't match the options, perhaps there's another factor affecting the amount needed, but the stoichiometry appears sound.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 11: Seeking Additional Insights**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Maybe Purity Affects Carbon Requirement:** Could the impurities in the metal alter how much carbon is needed?\n\n- **Alternative Reactions:** Is there another reaction happening that consumes carbon or produces CO differently?\n\n- **But Wait...** The reduction of Al\u2082O\u2083 by carbon is a well-established reaction, and the stoichiometry should hold even if the metal is impure, except if the impurities significantly interfere, which is unlikely for a 20% purity.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Sticking with the Original Method:** Given that no immediate alternative seems more straightforward and the stoichiometry is correct, I'll proceed with the original result while keeping an eye on the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 12: Final Calculation Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Double-Checking Moles Calculations:**\n\n  - Moles of KClO\u2083: 0.400 mol\n  - Moles of O\u2082 Produced: 0.200 mol\n  - Moles of Aluminum (Pure): 0.0800 mol\n  - Moles of Al\u2082O\u2083 Formed: 0.0400 mol\n  - Moles of Carbon Required: 0.120 mol\n  \n- **Mass of Carbon Required:**\n\n  \\[\n  0.120 \\, \\text{mol} \\times 12.0 \\, \\text{g/mol} = 1.44 \\, \\text{g}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Final Check:** All steps consistently lead to 1.44 g of carbon needed.\n\n**Does This Align with Expectations?**\n\n- **But Wait, This Still Doesn't Match the Options:** The result (1.44 g) doesn't correspond to any of the provided options (0.72 g, 0.48 g, 0.36 g, 0.06 g).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Possible Misinterpretation:** Perhaps the problem expects the purity to play a more significant role, or there's another step or detail in the question that hasn't been fully accounted for.\n\n- **Reexamining the Question:** The question states the metal is 20% pure, which has been factored in by calculating the moles of pure metal.\n\n- **Alternative Possible Insight:** Maybe the carbon requirement is being miscalculated due to an incorrect assumption about the stoichiometry or the role of impurities.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\n- **Given the Consistency:** Multiple checks and reflections lead consistently to the 1.44 g requirement, suggesting that the stoichiometry is correctly applied.\n\n- **Aha Moment:** It's possible that the options provided are based on a different aspect of the problem or a simpler scenario, but for the given steps, 1.44 g is the correct amount of carbon needed to reduce the aluminum oxide back to aluminum.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nAfter thoroughly exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and consistently verifying calculations, the amount of carbon required to convert the metal oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083) back to pure aluminum is **1.44 g**. However, this does not match any of the provided options, suggesting that there might be an oversight in the problem's setup, the options given, or an additional detail not initially considered.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**1.44 g**\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Importance of Stoichiometry:** Precise stoichiometric calculations are crucial in determining the amounts of reactants and products.\n\n- **Need for Reflection:** Regularly checking each step helps catch potential errors early.\n\n- **Flexibility in Approach:** Being open to changing strategies ensures that the most effective method is used, especially when initial calculations don't align with expected options.\n\n- **Value of Multiple Checks:** Consistent verification leads to confidence in the correctness of the final answer, even if it doesn't match provided options.\n\n- **Awareness of Possible Oversights:** Recognizing that provided options might not always align with calculated values helps maintain focus on the correctness of the solution rather than external discrepancies.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's revisit the problem, rebrainstorm my approach, and integrate a new solution to ensure correctness. I\u2019ll walk through this just like a human would, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and adjusting my method as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Recap of the User Request**\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- 49 g of KClO\u2083 decomposes to liberate O\u2082.\n- The resulting O\u2082 reacts with 10.8 g of impure aluminum (20% purity) to form aluminum oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083).\n- Calculate the amount of carbon needed to convert the aluminum oxide back to pure aluminum.\n- Options provided: **(A) 0.72 g, (B) 0.48 g, (C) 0.36 g, (D) 0.06 g**\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Brainstorming and Strategy Review**\n\nIn my earlier attempt, I:\n\n1. **Calculated the moles of O\u2082 produced from KClO\u2083 decomposition.**\n2. **Determined the moles of impure aluminum available.**\n3. **Identified aluminum as the metal and wrote the reaction forming Al\u2082O\u2083.**\n4. **Calculated moles of Al\u2082O\u2083 formed.**\n5. **Determined the moles of carbon required to reduce Al\u2082O\u2083 back to aluminum.**\n6. **Converted moles of carbon to grams.**\n\nHowever, my initial calculation led to **1.44 g** of carbon required, which doesn't match any of the provided options. This discrepancy suggests there might be an oversight in the stoichiometry or how the purity affects the calculations.\n\n**Reflection:** The previous approach seems correct in terms of stoichiometry, but the final answer doesn't align with the given options. This indicates that either the sample solution has a different interpretation or an additional factor needs to be considered.\n\n---\n\n### **Identifying the Problem and Adjusting the Approach**\n\n**Realization:**\n\n- **Wait, that can't be right because...** The mass of carbon needed (1.44 g) doesn't match any of the provided options.
