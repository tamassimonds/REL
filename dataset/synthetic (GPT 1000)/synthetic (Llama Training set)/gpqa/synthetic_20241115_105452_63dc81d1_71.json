    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The goal is to identify the chemical compound with the formula **C\u2087H\u2081\u2082O** using FTIR, **\u00b9H NMR**, and **\u00b9\u00b3C NMR** data. The options are:\n\n- (A) 4-Methyl-4-Hexenal\n- (B) 3-Heptenal\n- (C) 5-Methyl-4-Hexenal\n- (D) 4-Methyl-2-Cyclohexen-1-ol\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we're trying to pinpoint a specific chemical structure based on spectral data. This reminds me of analytical chemistry labs where we align theoretical knowledge with practical data interpretation. I know that **FTIR** helps identify functional groups, while **NMR** (both **\u00b9H** and **\u00b9\u00b3C**) provides insights into the molecular structure, like carbon environments and hydrogen interactions.\n\nInitially, my thought is to **analyze each spectral piece step by step**, starting with FTIR since it's straightforward in identifying functional groups.\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\n- **FTIR**: Strong absorption at 1725 cm\u207b\u00b9. This likely indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), possibly an aldehyde or ketone.\n- **\u00b9H NMR**: Peaks at 5.2 ppm with a **1:3:3:1** ratio. This looks like a **doublet quartet**, which could imply a vinyl group attached to a non-protonated carbon.\n- **\u00b9\u00b3C NMR**: A peak at 134 ppm suggests a carbon environment typically associated with unsaturated carbons, like those in alkenes or aromatic rings.\n\n**Brainstorming:** Maybe I should start with FTIR to confirm the presence of a carbonyl group, then move to NMR to deduce the structure further. Alternatively, I could try matching the entire structure with the options available, but that might get messy without initial confirmations.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing FTIR Data**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The strong absorption peak at **1725 cm\u207b\u00b9** is characteristic of a **carbonyl group (C=O)**.\n- Aldehydes typically show around **1720 cm\u207b\u00b9**, while ketones are slightly lower, around **1715 cm\u207b\u00b9**.\n\n**Quick Check:** Does **1725 cm\u207b\u00b9** fit? Yes, it's close to the aldehyde region.\n\n**Reflection:** This suggests that the compound likely has an aldehyde functional group. Aldehydes are usually at **1720-1740 cm\u207b\u00b9**, so **1725 cm\u207b\u00b9** aligns well.\n\n**Conclusion for FTIR:** The presence of a carbonyl group at **1725 cm\u207b\u00b9** supports the idea that we might be dealing with an **aldehyde**, narrowing down our options.\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring \u00b9H NMR Data**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The typical chemical shift for aldehyde protons is around **9-10 ppm**.\n- However, we have peaks at **5.2 ppm** with a **1:3:3:1 ratio**, indicating a **doublet quartet**.\n\n**Initial Confusion:** Wait, aldehyde protons should be at higher ppm values. So, **5.2 ppm** doesn't sound like an aldehyde proton directly.\n\n**Realization:** The **5.2 ppm** signal might not be the aldehyde proton itself but rather a proton on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (as seen in \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes).\n\n**Potential Strategy:** Maybe this indicates a **vinyl proton** adjacent to the carbonyl, suggesting a **double bond** in the molecule.\n\n**Reflection:** This aligns with an **\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde** like **4-Methyl-4-Hexenal**, where protons on the double bond appear downfield due to the nearby carbonyl.\n\n**Conclusion for \u00b9H NMR:** The **doublet quartet** pattern at **5.2 ppm** suggests a **vinyl group** near a carbonyl, supporting the presence of an **\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde**.\n\n### **Step 4: Interpreting \u00b9\u00b3C NMR Data**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The peak at **134 ppm** likely corresponds to an **unsaturated carbon**.\n- Unsaturated carbons near a carbonyl group (like those in alkenes) can appear downfield, around **120-150 ppm**.\n\n**Quick Check:** Does **134 ppm** fit this range? Yes, it does.\n\n**Reflection:** This further supports the idea of an **\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde**. The presence of such an unsaturated carbon aligns with the **\u00b9H NMR** data indicating a vinyl group.\n\n**Conclusion for \u00b9\u00b3C NMR:** The **134 ppm** peak suggests an **alkene carbon** near a carbonyl, consistent with an **\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde** like **5-Methyl-4-Hexenal** or **4-Methyl-4-Hexenal**.\n\n### **Step 5: Narrowing Down the Options**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **FTIR** confirms a carbonyl group (likely aldehyde).\n- **\u00b9H NMR** suggests a vinyl group near the carbonyl, typically found in **\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes**.\n- **\u00b9\u00b3C NMR** supports the presence of unsaturated carbons.\n\n**Options Left:**\n\n- **(A) 4-Methyl-4-Hexenal**\n- **(B) 3-Heptenal**\n- **(C) 5-Methyl-4-Hexenal**\n- **(D) 4-Methyl-2-Cyclohexen-1-ol**\n\n**Reflection:** Given the **\u00b9H NMR** data, especially the **1:3:3:1** ratio**, it suggests a **doublet quartet**, which is indicative of a specific splitting pattern typical in **vinyl protons**. This pattern is commonly seen in **symmetrical molecules**.\n\n**Potential Mistake:** Initially, I might overlook the symmetrical aspect and lean towards unsymmetrical compounds. But recalling that **4-Methyl-4-Hexenal** has a symmetrical structure, this could explain the **NMR** pattern better.\n\n### **Step 6: Revisiting \u00b9H NMR for Specific Patterns**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The **1:3:3:1** ratio suggests a **doublet quartet**, which usually arises from **two types of protons** on adjacent carbons.\n- In **4-Methyl-4-Hexenal**, the methyl group can create this splitting pattern near the double bond.\n\n**Quick Check:** Does this make sense?\n\n- The methyl group attached to the carbonyl can cause **splitting** in the vinyl protons, leading to the observed pattern.\n- This aligns with the **\u00b9H NMR** data.\n\n**Reflection:** This suggests the molecule has a **methyl group** attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, fitting **4-Methyl-4-Hexenal** perfectly.\n\n### **Step 7: Validating with the Other Options**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **(B) 3-Heptenal** and **(C) 5-Methyl-4-Hexenal** don't have the same level of symmetry or the specific **\u00b9H NMR** pattern observed.\n- **(D) 4-Methyl-2-Cyclohexen-1-ol** introduces a cyclohexene ring, which doesn't align with the **\u00b9H NMR** data.\n\n**Quick Check:** Do any of these options fit the **\u00b9H NMR** splitting pattern?\n\n- **3-Heptenal**: An unsaturated aldehyde with no methyl group at the necessary position.\n- **5-Methyl-4-Hexenal**: Maybe, but the **\u00b9H NMR** pattern is still more aligned with **4-Methyl-4-Hexenal**.\n- **4-Methyl-2-Cyclohexen-1-ol**: The cyclohexene ring would alter the **NMR** patterns significantly, which doesn't match our data.\n\n**Reflection:** The **\u00b9H NMR** data's **doublet quartet** is quite specific, and no option other than **4-Methyl-4-Hexenal** seems to fit this pattern neatly.\n\n### **Step 8: Finalizing the Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Combining all spectral data:\n  - **FTIR** confirms a carbonyl group (aldehyde).\n  - **\u00b9H NMR** indicates a vinyl group near the carbonyl, with a **doublet quartet** pattern related to a methyl group.\n  - **\u00b9\u00b3C NMR** supports unsaturated carbons.\n\n**Conclusion:** The most fitting structure is **(A) 4-Methyl-4-Hexenal**.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **FTIR**: Carbonyl group confirmed.\n- **\u00b9H NMR**: Vinyl protons near carbonyl with specific splitting pattern \u2192 Methyl group influence confirmed.\n- **\u00b9\u00b3C NMR**: Unsaturated carbon environment aligns with **\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde**.\n\n**Reflection:** Everything checks out. The **NMR** data aligns well with the expected chemical behavior of **4-Methyl-4-Hexenal**, making it the most plausible option.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**(A) 4-Methyl-4-Hexenal**\n\n**Closing Thoughts:** By methodically analyzing each spectral piece, aligning them with known chemical behavior, and validating against the given options, we confidently identify the compound as **4-Methyl-4-Hexenal**. Always ensure each spectral data piece aligns coherently, as inconsistencies can hint at misinterpretations or alternative structures.",

  "ground_truth": "4-Methyl-4-Hexenal\n\nAll 4 compounds contain a carbon-carbon double bond. Therefore, all would be expected to show a peak in the 1H NMR spectrum at around 5.2 ppm (vinyl C-H) and a peak in the 13C NMR at around 134 (vinyl carbon). The peak at 1725 in the FTIR spectrum is characteristic of a carbonyl stretch and therefore 4-Methyl-2-Cyclohexen-1-ol can be ruled out as this is the only compound that does not contain a carbonyl group. To determine the correct answer out of the remaining three one must consider the coupling effects in the 1H NMR spectrum due to neighbouring hydrogens. The 1:3:3:1 ratio peak in the 1H NMR spectrum is characteristic of a quartet peak due to 3 equivalent neighbouring hydrogen atoms (n+1 rule). Looking at the structures, a quartet peak due to the vinyl-H would be expected for 4-Methyl-4-Hexenal and so this is the correct answer. For 3-Heptenal one would expect to see a doublet of triplets for the vinyl-H peak whilst for 5-Methyl-4-Hexenal one would expect to see a triplet for the same peak. These peaks do not have a ratio of 1:3:3:1 and hence these two answers are incorrect."
