    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting if each approach works, and checking my progress along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n> **For what real values of \\( a \\) is the expression \\( \\frac{a+3}{a^2-4} \\) undefined? List your answers in increasing order separated by commas.**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a rational expression, similar to ones I've dealt with before. I remember that expressions become undefined when the denominator equals zero. \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Set the Denominator to Zero:** This seems straightforward\u2014find where \\( a^2 - 4 = 0 \\).\n  2. **Factor the Denominator:** Maybe factoring could simplify finding the zeros.\n  3. **Use the Quadratic Formula:** If factoring doesn't work easily, the quadratic formula could help.\n  \n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure if there are other values affecting the numerator, but typically, denominators dictate when expressions are undefined.\n\n### **Step 1: Set the Denominator to Zero**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's start by setting the denominator equal to zero because that's where the expression is undefined.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\na^2 - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solve for \\( a \\)**\n\n**Approach 1: Factoring the Quadratic**\n\n- **Reflection:** I recall that \\( a^2 - 4 \\) is a difference of squares. This should be easy to factor.\n  \n  **Factorization:**\n  \\[\n  a^2 - 4 = (a - 2)(a + 2) = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solution:**  \n  Setting each factor to zero gives:\n  \\[\n  a - 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = 2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a + 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = -2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Quick Check:**  \n  Wait, does this make sense? It's a simple factoring problem. \\( 2 \\) and \\( -2 \\) are real numbers, so they fit the requirement.\n\n**Approach 2: Quadratic Formula**\n\n- **Reflection:** Just to double-check, let's apply the quadratic formula in case factoring isn't clear.\n\n  **Quadratic Formula:**\n  \\[\n  a = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n  \\]\n  \n  **Applying it to \\( a^2 - 4 = 0 \\):**\n  - Here, \\( b = 0 \\), so:\n  \\[\n  a = \\frac{-0 \\pm \\sqrt{0^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-4)}}{2 \\times 1}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a = \\frac{\\pm \\sqrt{16}}{2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a = \\frac{\\pm 4}{2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  a = \\pm 2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Both methods yield the same solutions: \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( a = -2 \\).\n\n### **Step 3: List the Values in Increasing Order**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe question asks for the values in increasing order, so I should list them from the smallest to the largest.\n\n**List of Undefined Values:**\n\\[\na = -2, \\, 2\n\\]\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Solutions**\n\n**Approach:**  \nLet's quickly plug these values back into the original denominator to ensure they make it zero.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{For } a = -2: \\quad (-2)^2 - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{For } a = 2: \\quad (2)^2 - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nBoth \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( a = 2 \\) make the denominator zero, confirming that the expression is indeed undefined at these points.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\na = -2, \\, 2\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Reflection**\n\n- **Strategy Check:**  \n  Initially, I considered different methods\u2014factoring and the quadratic formula. Factoring was straightforward and worked perfectly, so I stuck with it. The quadratic formula confirmed the solution, acting as a backup.\n  \n- **Mistake Prevention:**  \n  By verifying the solutions by plugging them back into the denominator, I ensured that \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( a = 2 \\) are correct.\n  \n- **Natural Flow:**  \n  The process felt logical\u2014identifying where the denominator is zero, solving for \\( a \\), and then verifying the solutions. It mirrors how I would approach the problem manually.\n\n- **Alternative Approaches:**  \n  I briefly considered checking for issues in the numerator, but recalling that only the denominator affects the definedness clarified that only \\( a^2 - 4 = 0 \\) was necessary.\n\n---\n\nOverall, by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting and verifying each step, and ensuring the solutions fit the original problem, I've confidently arrived at the answer: \\( a = -2, \\, 2 \\).",
