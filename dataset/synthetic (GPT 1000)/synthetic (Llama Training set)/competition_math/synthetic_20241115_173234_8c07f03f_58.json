    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming and exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking my work along the way. Let's make this as natural and human-like as possible in terms of thought process.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n**Find the product of the nonreal roots of \\( x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x = 2005 \\).**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This equation looks like a polynomial equation set equal to a constant. I remember dealing with similar problems where finding roots or factoring was involved. But wait, there\u2019s a \\(2005\\) on the right side; that makes it different from standard polynomial equations.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Rearrange the Equation:** Bring all terms to one side to set it equal to zero.\n  2. **Factor the Left Side:** Try to factor \\( x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x \\) to see if it simplifies.\n  3. **Use the Quadratic Formula:** After rearranging, possibly treat it as a quadratic in a higher power.\n  4. **Graphical Approach:** Although not always precise, sketching or using a graphing tool might help visualize the roots.\n  5. **Check for Symmetry or Patterns:** The coefficients look like they might relate to binomial expansions.\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...** Initially, I thought about using the quadratic formula, but this is a quartic equation. Perhaps treating it as a quadratic in terms of \\( x^2 \\) and \\( x^1 \\) might help after rearranging.\n\n**So, let's start by...** Rearranging the equation to set it to zero and see if factoring is possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Rearranging the Equation**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nLet\u2019s bring all terms to one side to make it easier to analyze.\n\n\\[\nx^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x - 2005 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this look standard? Yes, now it's in the form \\( ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0 \\).\n\n**Next Steps:**  \nNow, I\u2019ll try to factor the left-hand side or see if there\u2019s a recognizable pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting to Factor the Polynomial**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nThe coefficients \\(1, -4, 6, -4\\) remind me of the binomial expansion of \\((x - 1)^4\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, if this is similar to \\((x - 1)^4\\), then our equation is:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)^4 - 1 = 2005\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**  \n\\((x - 1)^4 - 1 = 2005\\) simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)^4 = 2006\n\\]\n\n**Does this make sense?**  \nYes, it implies that \\(x - 1\\) is the fourth root of \\(2006\\). So,\n\n\\[\nx - 1 = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{2006}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 1 \\pm \\sqrt[4]{2006}\n\\]\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...** But this gives me two real roots (\\(1 + \\sqrt[4]{2006}\\) and \\(1 - \\sqrt[4]{2006}\\)), and we're looking for the *nonreal* roots. So, there must be more roots involved.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, perhaps I need to consider all fourth roots, including the complex ones. Let\u2019s think about the fourth roots of unity and see how they apply here.\n\n**Ah! This reminds me of...** The fact that in addition to real roots, a quartic equation can have complex roots depending on the coefficients and the constant term.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering All Fourth Roots**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nOkay, if \\((x - 1)^4 = 2006\\), then the general solution involves all fourth roots of \\(2006\\):\n\n\\[\nx - 1 = \\sqrt[4]{2006} \\times \\text{cis}\\left(\\frac{2k\\pi}{4}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, 3\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\text{cis}(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)\\).\n\n**Calculating:**  \nLet\u2019s compute each root:\n\n1. **For \\(k = 0\\):**\n   \\[\n   x - 1 = \\sqrt[4]{2006}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 1 + \\sqrt[4]{2006}\n   \\]\n\n2. **For \\(k = 1\\):**\n   \\[\n   x - 1 = \\sqrt[4]{2006} \\times i = \\sqrt[4]{2006} \\times \\text{cis}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 1 + \\sqrt[4]{2006}i\n   \\]\n\n3. **For \\(k = 2\\):**\n   \\[\n   x - 1 = \\sqrt[4]{2006} \\times (-1) = -\\sqrt[4]{2006}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 1 - \\sqrt[4]{2006}\n   \\]\n\n4. **For \\(k = 3\\):**\n   \\[\n   x - 1 = \\sqrt[4]{2006} \\times (-i) = -\\sqrt[4]{2006}i\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 1 - \\sqrt[4]{2006}i\n   \\]\n\n**Real and Nonreal Roots Identified:**\n\n- **Real Roots:** \\(x = 1 + \\sqrt[4]{2006}\\) and \\(x = 1 - \\sqrt[4]{2006}\\)\n- **Nonreal Roots:** \\(x = 1 + \\sqrt[4]{2006}i\\) and \\(x = 1 - \\sqrt[4]{2006}i\\)\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this cover all roots? Yes, because a quartic equation has four roots, and we\u2019ve identified all four: two real and two nonreal.\n\n**Next Steps:**  \nNow, I need to find the product of the nonreal roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Product of the Nonreal Roots**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nWe have two nonreal roots: \\(1 + \\sqrt[4]{2006}i\\) and \\(1 - \\sqrt[4]{2006}i\\). To find their product:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\sqrt[4]{2006}i) \\times (1 - \\sqrt[4]{2006}i)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, this looks like a difference of squares, which is:\n\n\\[\n(a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2\n\\]\n\n**Applying:**  \nLet\u2019s assign:\n\\[\na = 1, \\quad b = \\sqrt[4]{2006}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[\n(1 + \\sqrt[4]{2006}i)(1 - \\sqrt[4]{2006}i) = 1^2 + (\\sqrt[4]{2006})^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\n1 + (\\sqrt[4]{2006})^2 = 1 + \\sqrt{2006}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this seem correct? Yes, because multiplying a complex number by its conjugate yields a real number.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes \\( \\sqrt{2006} \\) seem reasonable? \\( \\sqrt{2000} \\approx 44.72 \\), and since \\(2006\\) is slightly more, it should be around \\(44.83\\). So, \\(1 + \\sqrt{2006} \\approx 45.83\\), which is plausible.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe product of the nonreal roots is \\(1 + \\sqrt{2006}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nLet me double-check if all steps align and if the final answer makes sense.\n\n- **All Roots Identified:** Yes, all four roots (two real and two nonreal) are accounted for.\n- **Product Calculation:** Using the difference of squares is appropriate for multiplying complex conjugates.\n- **Final Answer:** \\(1 + \\sqrt{2006}\\) is a reasonable and expected result for the product of the nonreal roots.\n\n**Does everything check out?**  \nYes, the approach is consistent, and the calculations lead to a plausible answer. It aligns with the properties of polynomials and roots.\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nInitially, I considered factoring the polynomial directly, but recognizing the structure related to \\((x - 1)^4\\) was key. By exploring all fourth roots, including the nonreal ones, and applying the difference of squares for conjugates, I arrived at the correct product.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe product of the nonreal roots of the equation \\( x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x = 2005 \\) is **\\(1 + \\sqrt{2006}\\)**.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nThroughout the process, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying calculations ensured a thorough and correct approach to solving the problem.",
