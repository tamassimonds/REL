Let\u2019s dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work frequently, and reflecting on whether my approach makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, the problem is to compute \\( 98 \\times 102 \\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Similarity to a Known Pattern:** This multiplication reminds me of the algebraic identity \\( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \\). I recall that multiplying numbers close to 100 can be handled using such identities.\n  \n- **Standard Multiplication:** Another approach is to use the traditional long multiplication method I learned in school. This should work, though it might be a bit more time-consuming.\n\n- **NearehMixinety Multiplication Trick:** There\u2019s also the \"multiplying by numbers near 100\" trick that involves using 100 as a base, which could simplify calculations.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Option 1:** Use the algebraic identity I mentioned. Let\u2019s see if applying \\( (a + b)(a - b) \\) is viable here.\n\n- **Option 2:** Perform standard long multiplication step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Option 3:** Apply the multiplying-near-100 strategy, which leverages the base of 100 for quicker calculations.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m leaning towards using the \\( (a + b)(a - b) \\) identity because it feels more straightforward with numbers close to 100. But I\u2019ll also consider other methods to verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting the Algebraic Identity**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe identity \\( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \\) is useful when you have numbers that can be expressed as \\( a + b \\) and \\( a - b \\). Let\u2019s see if we can fit our numbers into this mold.\n\n**Exploring the Strategy:**\n\n- Let\u2019s express 98 and 102 in terms of a base and an offset.\n  \n- **Assigning Variables:**\n  - Let\u2019s say \\( a = 100 \\), which is the midpoint of 98 and 102.\n  - \\( b = 2 \\) and \\(-2\\) respectively for 102 and 98.\n\n**Applying the Identity:**\n\n\\[\n(98)(102) = (100 - 2)(100 + 2) = 100^2 - 2^2\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n100^2 = 10,000\n\\]\n\\[\n2^2 = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n10,000 - 4 = 9,996\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me briefly verify if this makes sense.\n\n- \\( 100^2 \\) is indeed 10,000.\n- Subtracting 4 (which is \\( 2^2 \\)) gives 9,996.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems correct because the identity should work for any numbers around 100. However, let me cross-check using another method to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying with Standard Long Multiplication**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe I should try the traditional long multiplication to see if I get the same result. This will confirm whether the algebraic identity approach was correct.\n\n**Performing Long Multiplication:**\n\n\\[\n98 \\times 102 = 98 \\times (100 + 2) = 98 \\times 100 + 98 \\times 2\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n98 \\times 100 = 9,800\n\\]\n\\[\n98 \\times 2 = 196\n\\]\n\\[\n9,800 + 196 = 9,996\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nAdding \\( 9,800 \\) and \\( 196 \\) gives \\( 9,996 \\), which matches our previous result.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow I\u2019m really confident because both methods lead to the same answer. It\u2019s a good practice to verify using different strategies, especially with multiplication.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Multiplying-Near-100 Trick**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s try the multiplying-near-100 trick to see if it aligns with our previous findings. This technique is specifically designed for numbers close to 100 and can be quite efficient.\n\n**Exploring the Strategy:**\n\n- **Break Down the Numbers:**\n  - \\( 98 \\) is \\( 100 - 2 \\)\n  - \\( 102 \\) is \\( 100 + 2 \\)\n\n- **Use the Formula:**\n  \\[\n  (100 - x)(100 + x) = 100^2 - x^2\n  \\]\n  Where \\( x = 2 \\) in this case.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n100^2 = 10,000\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = 2^2 = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n10,000 - 4 = 9,996\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nOnce again, the result is \\( 9,996 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculations. The multiplying-near-100 trick is consistent with the algebraic identity and the standard long multiplication approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Is the Answer Reasonable?**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let\u2019s consider whether \\( 9,996 \\) makes sense as the product of \\( 98 \\) and \\( 102 \\).\n\n**Quick Sanity Check:**\n\n- **Proximity to 10,000:** Since 98 and 102 are both close to 100, their product should be close to \\( 10,000 \\) (which is \\( 100^2 \\)). Subtracting a small number (4) from \\( 10,000 \\) makes \\( 9,996 \\) reasonable.\n\n- **Magnitude:** The difference from \\( 10,000 \\) is only 4, which aligns with the \\( 98 \\times 102 \\) multiplication since the numbers are only a couple of units away from 100.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The answer makes sense both mathematically and intuitively.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies\u2014using the algebraic identity, standard long multiplication, and the multiplying-near-100 trick\u2014all methods consistently lead to the same answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9,996}\n\\]\n\nBy reflecting, checking, and verifying through different approaches, I\u2019m confident that \\( 98 \\times 102 = 9,996 \\) is correct.",
