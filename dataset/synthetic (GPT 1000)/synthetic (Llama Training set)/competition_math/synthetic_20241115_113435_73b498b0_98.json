    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. This means brainstorming different strategies, checking if they're correct, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming and Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem states that the ratio of \\( x \\) to \\( y \\) is \\( 1 \\) to \\( 2 \\), and we also have the equation \\( y = 4x - 36 \\). We need to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a problem involving ratios and linear equations. Ratios often relate two quantities, and the given equation connects \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) linearly. \n- **Familiar Strategies:** Maybe I can use the definition of ratios to express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\), or vice versa. Another approach could be to substitute the expression for \\( y \\) into the ratio equation.\n- **Possible Challenges:** Ensure that I set up the ratio correctly. Also, make sure that the substitution doesn't lead to any contradictions.\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, I need to be sure that the ratio and the equation can work together meaningfully. Let me explore this further.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Use the Definition of Ratio**\n\n- The ratio of \\( x \\) to \\( y \\) being \\( 1 : 2 \\) means that:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n- This implies that \\( x \\) is half of \\( y \\):\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{1}{2} y\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Application:** I can substitute this expression for \\( y \\) into the given equation \\( y = 4x - 36 \\) to find \\( x \\).\n- **Concerns:** Let me check if substituting makes sense and leads to a solvable equation.\n\n**Strategy 2: Substitute \\( y \\) from the Given Equation into the Ratio**\n\n- Start with the ratio:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n- Given \\( y = 4x - 36 \\), substitute this into the ratio equation.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Application:** This should directly relate \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) through both the ratio and the linear equation.\n- **Concerns:** Make sure the substitution maintains the integrity of both expressions.\n\n**Reflection:** Both strategies seem viable. I'll start with Strategy 1 to see where it leads, and if it feels off, I'll pivot to Strategy 2.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementing Strategy 1: Using the Definition of Ratio**\n\n**Step 1: Express \\( x \\) in Terms of \\( y \\)**\n\nFrom the ratio:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{2} y\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Check:** This makes sense because if \\( x \\) is half of \\( y \\), then multiplying \\( x \\) by 2 should give \\( y \\).\n- **Equation Setup:** I can now substitute this expression into the given equation \\( y = 4x - 36 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Substitute into the Given Equation**\n\nSubstitute \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} y \\) into \\( y = 4x - 36 \\):\n\\[\ny = 4\\left(\\frac{1}{2} y\\right) - 36\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\ny = 2y - 36\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Simplification:** Bring all terms involving \\( y \\) to one side to solve for \\( y \\).\n- **Next Move:** Subtract \\( 2y \\) from both sides.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Equation**\n\n\\[\ny - 2y = -36 \\\\\n-y = -36\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Reflection:** This simplifies to \\( y = 36 \\). That seems straightforward.\n- **Check:** Let me verify if substituting \\( y = 36 \\) back into the original equation makes sense.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Solution**\n\nGiven \\( y = 36 \\), substitute back into \\( y = 4x - 36 \\):\n\\[\n36 = 4x - 36\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n36 + 36 = 4x \\\\\n72 = 4x \\\\\nx = \\frac{72}{4} \\\\\nx = 18\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Final Check:** So, \\( x = 18 \\) when \\( y = 36 \\). Let\u2019s see if this satisfies both the ratio and the equation.\n- **Ratio Check:** If \\( x = 18 \\) and \\( y = 36 \\), then \\( \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{18}{36} = \\frac{1}{2} \\), which matches the given ratio.\n- **Equation Check:** Substituting \\( x = 18 \\) into \\( y = 4x - 36 \\) gives \\( y = 72 - 36 = 36 \\), consistent with our earlier finding.\n\n**Reflection:** Both checks align perfectly, so the solution seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Strategy 2 - Substituting \\( y \\) into the Ratio Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Testing Strategy 2:** Even though Strategy 1 worked, it's good to verify using another approach to ensure the solution's validity.\n- **Start with the Ratio Equation:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\]\n- **Given:** \\( y = 4x - 36 \\)\n\n**Step 1: Rewrite the Ratio Equation**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{2} y\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute \\( y = 4x - 36 \\) into the Ratio Equation**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{2} (4x - 36)\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nx = 2x - 18\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( x \\)**\n\n\\[\nx - 2x = -18 \\\\\n-x = -18 \\\\\nx = 18\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Comparison:** This method also gives \\( x = 18 \\), which matches our previous solution.\n- **Verification:** Returning to the original equation and ratio confirms the correctness.\n\n**Reflection:** Strategy 2 confirms that \\( x = 18 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying through multiple approaches, the value of \\( x \\) is **18**. \n\n- **Final Check:** Both the ratio \\( \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) and the equation \\( y = 4x - 36 \\) are satisfied with \\( x = 18 \\) and \\( y = 36 \\).\n- **Process Reflection:** Starting with brainstorming helped in identifying suitable strategies. Each step involved checking and reflecting to ensure accuracy, and testing alternative methods reinforced the correctness of the solution. \n\nBy thinking through it step-by-step, just like a human would, including brainstorming, checking, and reflecting, we've arrived confidently at the solution.",
