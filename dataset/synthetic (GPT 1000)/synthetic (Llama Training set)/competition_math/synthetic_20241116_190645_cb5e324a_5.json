    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, my immediate reaction is to break it down. The question is about **Robert reading 90 pages per hour** and how many **270-page books** he can complete in **six hours**. \n\n- **Initial Thoughts**: \n  - \"Okay, so Robert reads 90 pages in one hour. I need to figure out how many pages he reads in six hours.\"\n  - \"Then, I need to determine how many 270-page books he can finish within that total number of pages.\"\n  - \"This seems like a straightforward multiplication followed by a division.\"\n\nBut then I remember that maybe I should reflect a bit more\u2014perhaps there's a common mistake or a deeper insight.\n\n- **Possible Mistake**: \n  - \"Wait, what if I multiply the number of pages per hour by six directly and then divide by 270? Does that make sense?\"\n\nLet\u2019s explore this approach before committing.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Total Pages Read in Six Hours**\n\n**Thought Process**:\n- **Approach**: Multiply the number of pages Robert reads per hour by the total hours.\n- **Calculation**:\n  \\[\n  90 \\text{ pages/hour} \\times 6 \\text{ hours} = 540 \\text{ pages}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection**:\n- \"Alright, so Robert reads **540 pages** in six hours. That seems logical since 90 times 6 is straightforward.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining Number of 270-Page Books Read**\n\n**Thought Process**:\n- **Approach**: Divide the total pages read by the number of pages in one book.\n- **Calculation**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{540 \\text{ pages}}{270 \\text{ pages/book}} = 2 \\text{ books}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection**:\n- \"So, Robert can read **2.0 books**. This is a clean division with no remainder, which feels right.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Calculation**\n\n**Thought Process**:\n- **Check**: Does this number make sense given the reading speed and total time?\n- **Verification**:\n  - \"If Robert reads 90 pages in one hour, then in six hours he reads 540 pages.\"\n  - \"Dividing 540 by 270 gives exactly 2, meaning he completes two full books.\"\n\n**Reflection**:\n- \"No discrepancies here. The numbers add up correctly.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Brainstorming**:\n- **Alternative Approach**: Instead of calculating total pages first, maybe think about how many **270-page books** fit into **540 pages**.\n\n**Thought Process**:\n- **Approach**: Directly determine how many 270-page books can fit into 540 pages without calculating total pages first.\n\n**Calculation**:\n\\[\n\\frac{540 \\text{ pages}}{270 \\text{ pages/book}} = 2 \\text{ books}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**:\n- \"This approach also leads me to the same answer\u2014**2 books**. It confirms our previous method.\"\n\n**Check**:\n- \"Using two different methods arriving at the same result adds confidence to the correctness.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Considering Possible Errors**\n\n**Thought Process**:\n- **Potential Mistake**: Did I accidentally overlook partial books or misinterpret the question?\n- **Reflection**: The problem specifically asks for **270-page books**, so only whole books count. Partial books don\u2019t count here.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- \"Since Robert reads exactly 540 pages, and each book is 270 pages, he completes exactly 2 books. There\u2019s no partial book needed.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process**:\n- **Check**: Re-evaluate all steps to ensure no calculation errors.\n- **Reflection**:\n  - \"Total pages calculated correctly? Yes, 540.\"\n  - \"Division for number of books? Yes, 540 divided by 270 is 2.\"\n  - \"Does this align with the reading speed and hours given? Absolutely.\"\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- \"Everything checks out. The answer is **2 books**.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nRobert can read **2** 270-page books in six hours.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Approach Validity**: Starting by calculating total pages read and then determining how many books fit is a logical and efficient strategy.\n- **Alternative Strategy**: Considering alternate methods reinforced the correctness of the initial approach.\n- **Error Checking**: Multiple reflections and checks ensured accuracy, preventing any oversight.\n- **Human-Like Thinking**: Emulating a natural thought process with brainstorming, reflections, and validations led to a confident and correct solution.\n\nIn summary, by exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying calculations, we arrive at the correct answer: Robert can read **2** 270-page books in six hours.",
