    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just as I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often to see if I'm on the right track, checking my work frequently, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**User Query:**\n\"The area of the base of a hemisphere is \\(100\\pi\\). What is the total surface area of the hemisphere? Express your answer in terms of \\(\\pi\\).\"\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Familiar Concepts:** This reminds me of problems involving the surface area of spheres and hemispheres. I recall that the base of a hemisphere is a circle, so the area given relates to the radius.\n  \n- **Uncertainties:** I'm not entirely sure how to connect the base area directly to the total surface area. I remember that hemispheres have both a curved surface and a flat circular base, but I'm fuzzy on the exact formulas.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Use the Area of the Base to Find the Radius:** Since the area of the base is given, I could use that to find the radius of the hemisphere.\n  2. **Calculate the Total Surface Area Using the Radius:** Once I have the radius, I can calculate the total surface area by adding the curved surface area and the area of the base.\n  3. **Check if There's an Alternative Approach:** Perhaps there's a way to relate the given area directly to the total surface area without explicitly finding the radius first.\n\nI think the first strategy makes the most sense: find the radius from the base area and then use that to find the total surface area. But let\u2019s explore each step carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Radius from the Base Area**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The area of the base is a circle, and we know the formula for the area of a circle is:\n  \n  \\[\n  A = \\pi r^2\n  \\]\n  \n  where \\( r \\) is the radius.\n\n- Given the area \\( A = 100\\pi \\), I can set up the equation:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\pi r^2 = 100\\pi\n  \\]\n  \n- To solve for \\( r^2 \\), I'll divide both sides by \\( \\pi \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  r^2 = \\frac{100\\pi}{\\pi} = 100\n  \\]\n  \n- Taking the square root to find \\( r \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  r = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? The radius \\( r = 10 \\) seems reasonable given the base area is \\( 100\\pi \\). The calculation aligns with the area formula.\n\n- **Conclusion:** I\u2019m confident that \\( r = 10 \\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Total Surface Area of the Hemisphere**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have the radius, I need to calculate the total surface area of the hemisphere. I recall that the total surface area includes:\n  \n  1. **Curved Surface Area (CSA):** The curved part of the hemisphere.\n  2. **Base Area (BA):** The flat circular base.\n\n- Therefore, the total surface area is:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Surface Area} = \\text{CSA} + \\text{BA}\n  \\]\n  \n- I need to find both the CSA and BA using the radius.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Curved Surface Area (CSA):**\n   \n   - The formula for the curved surface area of a hemisphere is:\n     \n     \\[\n     \\text{CSA} = 2\\pi r^2\n     \\]\n     \n   - Plugging in \\( r = 10 \\):\n     \n     \\[\n     \\text{CSA} = 2\\pi (10)^2 = 2\\pi \\times 100 = 200\\pi\n     \\]\n     \n2. **Base Area (BA):**\n   \n   - This is already given as:\n     \n     \\[\n     \\text{BA} = 100\\pi\n     \\]\n     \n3. **Total Surface Area:**\n   \n   - Adding CSA and BA:\n     \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Surface Area} = 200\\pi + 100\\pi = 300\\pi\n     \\]\n     \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Does the total surface area seem correct? The CSA and BA add up logically, and the use of the radius in the formulas aligns with geometric principles.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The calculation leads to a total surface area of \\( 300\\pi \\), which seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I want to ensure that each step makes sense and that I haven't overlooked anything.\n\n- **Did I correctly find the radius from the base area?** Yes, dividing the area by \\( \\pi \\) and taking the square root was straightforward.\n\n- **Is the formula for the curved surface area correct?** Yes, \\( 2\\pi r^2 \\) is the standard formula for the curved surface area of a hemisphere.\n\n- **Does adding the base area to the curved surface area yield the correct total?** Yes, the values add up as expected.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Does the answer make sense in context?** A hemisphere with a radius of 10 would have a considerable surface area, and \\( 300\\pi \\) is a plausible value.\n\n- **Any alternative methods?** While I could have approached it differently by perhaps using the relationship between the hemisphere and the sphere, the method I used is direct and effective.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully working through each step, reflecting on the calculations, and verifying the approach, the total surface area of the hemisphere is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{300\\pi}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Brainstorming Recap:** Initially, I considered using the base area to find the radius, then calculating the total surface area by adding the curved and base areas. This strategy worked well.\n\n- **Checking Work:** Throughout the process, I checked each calculation and ensured that the formulas applied were correct.\n\n- **Mistakes & Adjustments:** There were no major mistakes, but constantly reflecting helped confirm that each step was valid.\n\n- **Natural Flow:** The thought process flowed naturally, with initial uncertainties leading to a clear path once the radius was determined.\n\n- **Confidence in the Answer:** Given the step-by-step validation, I'm confident that the total surface area is correctly calculated as \\( 300\\pi \\).\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically, reflecting often, and being open to adjusting the strategy, I've arrived at the correct solution while ensuring each step is logically sound.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the hemisphere's radius be $r$.  The hemisphere's base is a circle with radius $r$; thus, we have $\\pi r^2 = 100\\pi$.  Taking the positive solution for $r$ yields $r = 10$.  The surface area of the curved part of the hemisphere is half the surface area of a sphere with radius 10, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4\\pi (10^2) = 200\\pi$.  The total surface area of the hemisphere is the sum of this curved surface area and the base area, which is $200\\pi+100\\pi=\\boxed{300\\pi}$."
