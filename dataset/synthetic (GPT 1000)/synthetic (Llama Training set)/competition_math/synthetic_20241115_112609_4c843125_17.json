    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on whether they're working, and adjusting as needed. Here we go.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem is about finding the smallest possible perimeter of a right triangle where all side lengths are integer multiples of 8. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Right Triangle Properties:** I remember that in a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem holds: \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), where \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.\n  \n- **Integer Multiples of 8:** This means all sides are \\(8k\\), \\(8m\\), and \\(8n\\), where \\(k\\), \\(m\\), and \\(n\\) are integers. So, factoring out 8 might simplify things.\n\n- **Minimizing Perimeter:** The perimeter is \\(8(k + m + n)\\), so minimizing \\(k + m + n\\) will minimize the perimeter.\n\nAt first glance, it seems like I need to find the smallest set of integers \\(k\\), \\(m\\), and \\(n\\) that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n- **Integer Multiples:** Since all sides are multiples of 8, I wonder if reducing each side by dividing by 8 simplifies the Pythagorean relationship.\n  \n- **Smallest Integer Multiples:** I need to make sure \\(k\\), \\(m\\), and \\(n\\) are the smallest possible integers that still satisfy the equation.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Factor Out 8:** Simplify the Pythagorean theorem by dividing all sides by 8 and see if the relationship holds with the reduced integers.\n   \n2. **List Small Right Triangles:** Generate a list of small right triangles and multiply their sides by 8 to find the smallest perimeter.\n\n3. **Use Pythagorean Triples:** Since the sides are integer multiples, perhaps leveraging known Pythagorean triples might help.\n\nLet me start with the first strategy\u2014factoring out 8\u2014to see if it leads anywhere.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Factoring Out 8**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf all sides are multiples of 8, I can factor 8 out of the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a, b, c) = (8k, 8m, 8n)\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n(8k)^2 + (8m)^2 = (8n)^2 \\implies 64(k^2 + m^2) = 64n^2 \\implies k^2 + m^2 = n^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis simplifies the equation to the standard Pythagorean theorem with \\(k\\), \\(m\\), and \\(n\\) being integers. It confirms that \\(k\\), \\(m\\), and \\(n\\) must form a Pythagorean triple. \n\n**Next Thoughts:**\n\nNow, I need to find the smallest integers \\(k\\), \\(m\\), and \\(n\\) that satisfy \\(k^2 + m^2 = n^2\\). This seems like looking for the smallest Pythagorean triple.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Smallest Pythagorean Triple**\n\n**Possible Strategy:**\n\nRecall that the smallest Pythagorean triple is \\(3, 4, 5\\). Let's see if using these values will work.\n\n\\[\nk = 3,\\ m = 4,\\ n = 5\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Check if \\(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\\):\n\n\\[\n9 + 16 = 25 \\quad \\text{\u2713}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis works! \\(3, 4,\\) and \\(5\\) satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n**Checking the Perimeter:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 8(k + m + n) = 8(3 + 4 + 5) = 8 \\times 12 = 96\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThis gives a perimeter of 96 units. But wait, let me consider if there could be a smaller Pythagorean triple or if this is indeed the smallest possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Smaller Integer Multiples**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEven though \\(3, 4, 5\\) is the smallest Pythagorean triple, I need to ensure that \\(k\\), \\(m\\), and \\(n\\) are the smallest integers that, when multiplied by 8, still form a valid right triangle.\n\n**Checking for Smaller Multiples:**\n\nLet's see if multiplying the sides by a factor smaller than 8 (e.g., 1) makes sense.\n\n- If \\(k, m,\\) and \\(n\\) are multiplied by 1, the triangle would have sides \\(8, 16, 24\\), which still satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n8^2 + 16^2 = 64 + 256 = 320 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 24^2 = 576 \\quad \\text{X}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that doesn't satisfy the Pythagorean theorem (\\(320 \\neq 576\\)). So, multiplying by 1 doesn't work.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis means \\(k, m,\\) and \\(n\\) must be at least \\(3, 4,\\) and \\(5\\), respectively.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nRecalculating the perimeter with \\(k = 3, m = 4, n = 5\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 8(3 + 4 + 5) = 8 \\times 12 = 96\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe perimeter is 96 units, which matches our earlier calculation. \n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nI initially considered whether there could be a smaller Pythagorean triple, but since \\(3, 4, 5\\) is the smallest and works when multiplied by 8, I\u2019m confident that 96 is indeed the smallest possible perimeter.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying calculations, the smallest possible perimeter of a right triangle with all side lengths being integer multiples of 8 is **96 units**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThroughout this problem, I started by understanding the relationship defined by the Pythagorean theorem and how multiplying each side by 8 affects it. I initially considered factoring out 8 to simplify the equation to find the smallest Pythagorean triple. By identifying \\(3, 4, 5\\) as the smallest Pythagorean triple and verifying that multiplying these by 8 gives a valid right triangle, I concluded that the perimeter is 96 units.\n\nReflecting along the way helped catch and correct a potential oversight about checking if smaller multiples could work, ensuring the solution's accuracy.",

  "ground_truth": "The smallest right triangle with integer lengths is the $3 - 4 - 5$ right triangle.  Since none of those lengths are multiples of 8, we must scale each side up by a factor of 8 to create a right triangle whose side lengths are all integer multiples of 8.  This triangle has perimeter $3\\cdot 8 + 4 \\cdot 8 + 5 \\cdot 8 = (3 + 4 + 5 )\\cdot 8 = 12\\cdot 8 = \\boxed{96}$ units."
