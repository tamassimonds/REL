I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work frequently to ensure everything makes sense. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at the problem:\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1 - x}{2x + 3} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x \\neq -\\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( y \\) that is **not attainable**, and express it as a common fraction.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- This looks like a rational function, similar to ones I've encountered before.\n- Maybe there's a restriction on \\( y \\) that we can identify by analyzing the function.\n- I recall that sometimes finding horizontal asymptotes can help determine unattainable values of \\( y \\).\n- Alternatively, I could set up an equation to see if certain \\( y \\)-values make \\( x \\) undefined.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Horizontal Asymptotes:** Analyze the behavior of \\( y \\) as \\( x \\) approaches infinity or negative infinity.\n2. **Set \\( y \\) to a Constant:** Solve for \\( x \\) by setting \\( y \\) to a specific value and see if a solution exists.\n3. **Analyze Limits:** Check the limits of \\( y \\) as \\( x \\) approaches critical points, like where the denominator is zero.\n\nI think starting with horizontal asymptotes makes sense because it deals directly with unattainable \\( y \\)-values. But if that doesn't pan out, I'll try the other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Horizontal Asymptotes**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- Horizontal asymptotes help determine \\( y \\)-values that the function approaches but never actually reaches.\n- To find horizontal asymptotes for rational functions, I typically look at the degrees of the numerator and denominator.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's examine the degrees:\n\n- **Numerator:** \\( 1 - x \\) is a polynomial of degree 1.\n- **Denominator:** \\( 2x + 3 \\) is also a polynomial of degree 1.\n\n**Based on Asymptote Rules:**\n\n- When the degrees of numerator and denominator are equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\n**Identifying Leading Coefficients:**\n\n- **Numerator:** Leading coefficient is \\(-1\\) (from \\(-x\\)).\n- **Denominator:** Leading coefficient is \\(2\\).\n\n**Horizontal Asymptote:**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-1}{2} \\quad \\text{as } x \\to \\pm\\infty\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This suggests that \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) is a horizontal asymptote. Therefore, \\( y \\) can get arbitrarily close to \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) but never actually reaches this value.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Wait, that makes sense because horizontal asymptotes represent values that the function approaches but doesn't attain.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 1:**\n\n- It seems like \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) is a candidate for the unattainable \\( y \\)-value.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying by Setting \\( y \\) to \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To confirm that \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) is indeed unattainable, let's see if there's any \\( x \\) that satisfies the equation when \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1 - x}{2x + 3}\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( x \\):**\n\n1. **Multiply both sides by the denominator to eliminate the fraction:**\n\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{1}{2} (2x + 3) = 1 - x\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying:\n\n   \\[\n   -x - \\frac{3}{2} = 1 - x\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add \\( x \\) to both sides:**\n\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{3}{2} = 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Wait, this leads to a contradiction:**\n\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{3}{2} = 1 \\quad \\text{(Impossible)}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The fact that we end up with a contradiction suggests that there is no \\( x \\) for which \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n- This reinforces the idea that \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) is indeed unattainable.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Does this make sense? Yes, because horizontal asymptotes represent values that the function approaches but never actually reaches.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 2:**\n\n- The verification confirms that \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) is an unattainable value for \\( y \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thinking:**\n\n- While the horizontal asymptote approach worked well, it's always good to explore other methods to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Analyzing Limits at Critical Points**\n\n- Let's check the limit of \\( y \\) as \\( x \\) approaches certain values, especially where the denominator doesn't cause division by zero.\n\n**Boundary Check:**\n\n- The only restriction given is \\( x \\neq -\\frac{3}{2} \\), so we'll check limits around this point.\n\n**Limit as \\( x \\) Approaches \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to -\\frac{3}{2}} y = \\frac{1 - (-\\frac{3}{2})}{2(-\\frac{3}{2}) + 3} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{3}{2}}{-3 + 3} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{2}}{0}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait, dividing by zero indicates a vertical asymptote, not a horizontal one.\n- This means that as \\( x \\) approaches \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\), \\( y \\) tends towards infinity or negative infinity.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- This does not conflict with our previous finding of the horizontal asymptote at \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n- It's just providing additional insight into the function's behavior.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 3:**\n\n- Exploring limits confirms that \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) is unattainable, and also highlights the presence of a vertical asymptote at \\( x = -\\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies:\n\n- **Horizontal Asymptote Method:** Identified \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) as unattainable because the function approaches this value but never actually reaches it.\n  \n- **Verification by Contradiction:** Confirmed that setting \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\) leads to an impossible equation, reinforcing that this \\( y \\)-value is unattainable.\n\n- **Alternative Approach with Limits:** Checked limits around critical points, which did not introduce any new unattainable \\( y \\)-values but confirmed the presence of vertical asymptotes.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies:** Approaching the problem from different angles ensured accuracy and confidence in the solution.\n- **Reflection and Checking:** Continuously reflecting and checking intermediate steps helped catch and confirm critical points.\n- **Flexibility in Thinking:** Being open to changing strategies when one approach didn't seem right led to a robust solution.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step journey captures the thought process naturally, showing brainstorming, reflections, checks, and final conclusions!",
