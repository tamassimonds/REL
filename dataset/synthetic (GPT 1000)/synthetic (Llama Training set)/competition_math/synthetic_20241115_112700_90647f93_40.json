Let's tackle this problem step by step, emulating human thought processes with brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and checking our work regularly. I'll walk through my initial thoughts, possible approaches, reflections, and adjustments as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\n**User's Query:**\nThe sequence \\((a_n)\\) is defined by \\(a_1 = 1,\\) \\(a_2 = 2,\\) and\n\\[\na_n^2 - a_{n - 1} a_{n + 1} = 1\n\\]\nfor all \\(n \\ge 2.\\) Find \\(a_{100}.\\)\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- Okay, we have a recurrence relation involving squares and products of terms in the sequence.\n- The given equation reminds me of relationships seen in linear recurrence sequences, but the presence of squares makes it look nonlinear.\n- I recall there are various types of sequences like Fibonacci, but they typically involve addition, not multiplication and squares.\n- Maybe it's related to Pythagorean triples or some geometric interpretation since squares are involved.\n- Alternatively, perhaps we can look for a pattern or closed-form solution by computing initial terms.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Compute Initial Terms:** Calculate the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges.\n2. **Look for a Recursive Formula:** Attempt to express \\(a_{n+1}\\) in terms of previous terms to find a relationship.\n3. **Explore Polynomial Solutions:** Assume a polynomial form for \\(a_n\\) and see if it fits.\n4. **Consider Geometric or Algebraic Interpretations:** Maybe visualize the equation geometrically to gain insights.\n\n**Which Strategy to Start With?**\n- Let\u2019s begin by **computing the initial terms** to see if a pattern emerges. This might help in identifying the type of sequence we're dealing with.\n- If that doesn\u2019t lead us anywhere, we can then explore other strategies like looking for a recursive formula or polynomial solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Computing Initial Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- We know \\(a_1 = 1\\) and \\(a_2 = 2\\).\n- We can use the given equation to compute subsequent terms.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Find \\(a_3\\):**\n  \\[\n  a_2^2 - a_1 a_3 = 1 \\implies 2^2 - 1 \\times a_3 = 1 \\implies 4 - a_3 = 1 \\implies a_3 = 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Find \\(a_4\\):**\n  \\[\n  a_3^2 - a_2 a_4 = 1 \\implies 3^2 - 2 \\times a_4 = 1 \\implies 9 - 2a_4 = 1 \\implies 2a_4 = 8 \\implies a_4 = 4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Find \\(a_5\\):**\n  \\[\n  a_4^2 - a_3 a_5 = 1 \\implies 4^2 - 3 \\times a_5 = 1 \\implies 16 - 3a_5 = 1 \\implies 3a_5 = 15 \\implies a_5 = 5\n  \\]\n  \n- **Find \\(a_6\\):**\n  \\[\n  a_5^2 - a_4 a_6 = 1 \\implies 5^2 - 4 \\times a_6 = 1 \\implies 25 - 4a_6 = 1 \\implies 4a_6 = 24 \\implies a_6 = 6\n  \\]\n\n**Resulting Sequence:**\n\\[\na_1 = 1, \\; a_2 = 2, \\; a_3 = 3, \\; a_4 = 4, \\; a_5 = 5, \\; a_6 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The sequence appears to be increasing by 1 at each step, resembling the natural numbers.\n- This suggests that the sequence might be \\(a_n = n\\), but we need to verify if this holds for the recurrence relation.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does \\(a_n = n\\) satisfy the recurrence?**\n  \\[\n  n^2 - (n-1)(n+1) = n^2 - (n^2 - 1) = 1\n  \\]\n  - This satisfies the equation for all \\(n \\ge 2\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- It seems that \\(a_n = n\\) for all \\(n\\). Let\u2019s test this hypothesis with a few more terms to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Validating the Hypothesis \\(a_n = n\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- If \\(a_n = n\\) is correct, it should satisfy the recurrence relation for all \\(n \\ge 2\\).\n- Let's compute a few more terms using this assumption to see if it consistently holds.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Assuming \\(a_n = n\\), compute \\(a_7\\):**\n  \\[\n  a_7 = 7\n  \\]\n  \n- **Verify using the recurrence:**\n  \\[\n  a_6^2 - a_5 a_7 = 6^2 - 5 \\times 7 = 36 - 35 = 1\n  \\]\n  - This holds true.\n\n- **Test \\(a_8\\):**\n  \\[\n  a_8 = 8\n  \\]\n  \n- **Verify:**\n  \\[\n  a_7^2 - a_6 a_8 = 7^2 - 6 \\times 8 = 49 - 48 = 1\n  \\]\n  - Again, this holds true.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The hypothesis \\(a_n = n\\) seems to be correct as it satisfies the recurrence for multiple terms.\n- However, to be thorough, let's consider if there might be other solutions or if this is the only one.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Are there other possible sequences?**\n  - Given the structure of the recurrence, it's possible that \\(a_n = n\\) is not the only solution. However, since it fits the initial conditions and satisfies the recurrence, it's likely the intended solution.\n  \n- **Does the recurrence imply \\(a_n = n\\)?**\n  - Yes, substituting \\(a_n = n\\) satisfies the equation for all \\(n \\ge 2\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- \\(a_n = n\\) appears to be a valid and possibly the only solution that fits both the initial conditions and the recurrence relation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding \\(a_{100}\\) Using the Identified Sequence**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since we've established that \\(a_n = n\\), finding \\(a_{100}\\) is straightforward.\n- However, let's briefly consider if there's any complexity involved in computing \\(a_{100}\\) directly.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\na_{100} = 100\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The sequence is linear, making it easy to determine any term directly by its index.\n- There\u2019s no need for iterative calculations or more complex algorithms here, which simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does \\(a_{100} = 100\\) align with the recurrence?**\n  \\[\n  a_{99}^2 - a_{98} a_{100} = 99^2 - 98 \\times 100 = 9801 - 9800 = 1\n  \\]\n  - This satisfies the recurrence, confirming that \\(a_{100} = 100\\) is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- \\(a_{100} = 100\\), consistent with the identified sequence and satisfying the recurrence relation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- While computing initial terms led us to the solution, it's beneficial to consider other methods to ensure completeness.\n- Perhaps looking for a closed-form formula or verifying through induction could strengthen our confidence.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Induction Proof**\n\n**Assumption:**\n- Let\u2019s assume \\(a_n = n\\) for all \\(n\\).\n\n**Base Cases:**\n- For \\(n = 2\\) to \\(n = 6\\), we've already verified that the recurrence holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\n- Assume \\(a_k = k\\) for all \\(k \\leq n\\).\n- Show that \\(a_{n+1} = n + 1\\).\n\n**Verification:**\n\\[\na_{n}^2 - a_{n-1} a_{n+1} = 1 \\implies n^2 - (n-1)(n+1) = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nn^2 - (n^2 - 1) = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n1 = 1\n\\]\n- The inductive step holds.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- By induction, \\(a_n = n\\) for all \\(n\\), confirming our earlier findings.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This alternative method reinforces the validity of our solution.\n- It\u2019s always good to verify through multiple strategies to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does this align with the recurrence?**\n  - Yes, every step satisfies the original equation, validating the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Original Approach:** Starting with computing initial terms was effective in identifying the pattern.\n- **Validation:** By testing multiple terms and considering an inductive proof, we solidified that \\(a_n = n\\) is indeed the correct solution.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Exploring different methods ensured that we weren't missing any potential solutions.\n- **Final Answer:** \\(a_{100} = 100\\), confidently derived through consistent application of the recurrence and validation steps.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nBy brainstorming different strategies, starting with computing initial terms, and validating our hypothesis through induction and multiple verifications, we've confidently concluded that \\(a_{100} = 100\\). This step-by-step approach, reflecting and checking at each stage, mirrors human problem-solving, ensuring accuracy and depth in the solution.",
