Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### First Thoughts and Brainstorming\n\n**Question:** Simplify \\((-3 - 2i) - (1 + 4i)\\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- When I first see this problem, I think, \"This looks like a subtraction of complex numbers.\" \n- I remember that dealing with complex numbers often involves separating real and imaginary parts.\n- It reminds me of adding or subtracting vectors, where you handle each component separately.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts:** This seems straightforward\u2014subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.\n2. **Visualize on the Complex Plane:** Maybe drawing the numbers out could help in understanding, though I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s necessary for simplicity.\n3. **Using Algebraic Expansion:** Expanding with parentheses like real numbers, but I don't think it's needed here since we're just subtracting.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The first strategy\u2014separating real and imaginary parts\u2014seems the most direct and logical.\n- The second strategy might be overcomplicating things; drawing could take time and isn't required for a simple calculation.\n- The third one doesn't really apply here since we don't need to multiply or distribute.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- I'll proceed with separating the real and imaginary parts. If this doesn't work, I'll reconsider, but it feels like the right path.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Write Down the Expression Clearly\n\n**Action:**\n- Let me restate the problem to ensure I understand it completely:\n\n  \\[\n   (-3 - 2i) - (1 + 4i)\n  \\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Double-checking the negative sign in front of the second bracket is important. Subtracting a complex number means distributing the negative sign.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Okay, I\u2019m clear that I need to subtract both the real and imaginary parts of the second complex number from the first.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Distributing the Negative Sign\n\n**Action:**\n- Before diving into separating parts, let's distribute the negative sign to the components inside the parentheses:\n\n  \\[\n   (-3 - 2i) - (1 + 4i) = (-3 - 2i) - 1 - 4i\n  \\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Wait, did I distribute correctly? That\u2019s:\n\n  \\[\n   -3 - 2i - 1 - 4i\n  \\]\n\n- It looks right, but let's make sure the signs are correct. Subtracting a positive real and imaginary part seems straightforward.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- No issues here. The distribution is correct. Now, it's time to combine like terms.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Combining Real Parts\n\n**Action:**\n- Focus on the real numbers:\n\n  \\[\n   -3 - 1 = -4\n  \\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Simple subtraction. Adding two negative numbers.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Seems correct. \\(-3 - 1 = -4\\) makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Combining Imaginary Parts\n\n**Action:**\n- Now, add the imaginary components:\n\n  \\[\n   -2i - 4i = -6i\n  \\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Adding two imaginary numbers with different coefficients. Correct sign and value?\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Yes, \\(-2i - 4i = -6i\\). Adding the coefficients works here.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Writing the Simplified Expression\n\n**Action:**\n- Combine the results from both parts:\n\n  \\[\n   -4 - 6i\n  \\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Final answer looks clean. Both parts are combined correctly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Double-checking: real part \\(-4\\) and imaginary part \\(-6i\\). Everything seems in order.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Quick Check\n\n**Action:**\n- Let's quickly verify if the approach makes sense.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Did I correctly distribute the negative sign?\n- Were the real and imaginary parts combined accurately?\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Yes, the negative sign was properly applied.\n- Both components were added correctly.\n\n**Check:**\n- \\((-3 - 1) = -4\\)\n- \\((-2i - 4i) = -6i\\)\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n---\n\n### Alternative Approach\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- I wonder if there's a faster way, like directly subtracting corresponding parts without distributing.\n\n**Action:**\n- Let me try simplifying without separating parts first:\n\n  \\[\n   (-3 - 2i) - (1 + 4i) = (-3 - 1) + (-2i - 4i) = -4 - 6i\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This aligns with the previous method. It confirms that separating parts is indeed the right approach, but skipping steps can also lead to the correct answer.\n\n**Check:**\n- Same final result: \\(-4 - 6i\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Both methods yield the same answer, confirming the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The step-by-step approach ensured that each part was handled correctly.\n- Checking along the way helped catch any potential mistakes early.\n- Exploring an alternative method reinforced the accuracy of the initial strategy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The simplified form of the expression is \\(-4 - 6i\\).\n\n---\n\nThroughout this process, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and consistently checking the work ensured a clear and accurate solution. This human-like thinking approach mimics how someone would naturally tackle and verify a problem, adapting as needed.",
