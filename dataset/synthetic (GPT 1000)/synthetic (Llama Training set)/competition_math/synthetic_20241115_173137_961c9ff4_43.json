Let's tackle this problem as if we're brainstorming and exploring different strategies, reflecting and checking along the way, just like a human would naturally think through it.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at the problem:\n\n- **Given:** The second and fifth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 17 and 19, respectively.\n- **Goal:** Find the eighth term.\n\nInitial Reaction:\n- Hmm, this reminds me of problems involving arithmetic sequences where each term has a fixed difference from the previous one.\n- I think I need to recall the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence.\n- Maybe I can set up equations based on the given terms to find the common difference and the first term.\n- But I'm not entirely sure if that's the quickest way. Let me think if there's a better method.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Arithmetic Sequence Formula:**\n   - I know that the \\(n\\)-th term can be expressed as \\(a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term and \\(d\\) is the common difference.\n   - Perhaps I can set up two equations using the second and fifth terms to solve for \\(a_1\\) and \\(d\\).\n\n2. **Observe the Difference Between Given Terms:**\n   - Since it's an arithmetic sequence, the difference between terms is constant.\n   - Maybe I can find the common difference by looking at the gap between the second and fifth terms.\n\n3. **Check Consistency with Arithmetic Properties:**\n   - I could verify if the differences align with the properties of arithmetic sequences, ensuring the approach is correct.\n\nLet me start with the first strategy because it seems the most straightforward: setting up equations based on the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up Equations Using the Formula**\n\nGiven:\n- \\(a_2 = a_1 + d = 17\\)\n- \\(a_5 = a_1 + 4d = 19\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Alright, I've got two equations with two unknowns (\\(a_1\\) and \\(d\\)).\n- This looks like a system of equations problem. I can solve them simultaneously.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **Equation 1:** \\(a_1 + d = 17\\) \\quad \\((1)\\)\n2. **Equation 2:** \\(a_1 + 4d = 19\\) \\quad \\((2)\\)\n\n**Wait a Sec:**\n- To eliminate \\(a_1\\), I can subtract Equation \\((1)\\) from Equation \\((2)\\).\n\n**Performing Subtraction:**\n\\[\n(a_1 + 4d) - (a_1 + d) = 19 - 17\n\\]\n\\[\n3d = 2\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(d\\):**\n\\[\nd = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Okay, I found \\(d = \\frac{2}{3}\\). That seems reasonable because it's a small fractional difference.\n- But let me quickly check: If the common difference is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), adding it three times to the second term (\\(17\\)) should give me the fifth term (\\(19\\)).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\\[\n17 + 3 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 17 + 2 = 19\n\\]\n- Yup, that checks out. The calculation aligns with the given fifth term.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:**\n- The common difference \\(d\\) is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Seems correct so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the First Term (\\(a_1\\))**\n\nNow that I have \\(d = \\frac{2}{3}\\), let's find \\(a_1\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I can substitute \\(d\\) back into either Equation \\((1)\\) or \\((2)\\) to solve for \\(a_1\\).\n- I'll use Equation \\((1)\\) because it's simpler.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\na_1 + \\frac{2}{3} = 17\n\\]\n\\[\na_1 = 17 - \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Sec:**\n- Let me convert \\(17\\) into a fraction to subtract \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) easily.\n\n**Converting:**\n\\[\n17 = \\frac{51}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\na_1 = \\frac{51}{3} - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{49}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So, \\(a_1 = \\frac{49}{3}\\).\n- I wonder if this makes sense. Let me think: if the first term is \\(\\frac{49}{3}\\) and the common difference is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), the sequence should progress correctly.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Adding the common difference to \\(a_1\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{49}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{51}{3} = 17\n\\]\n- This matches the second term given. So it checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Eighth Term**\n\nNow, I need to find \\(a_8\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I can use the arithmetic sequence formula again: \\(a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\\).\n- Let's plug in \\(n = 8\\), along with \\(a_1\\) and \\(d\\) that we found.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\na_8 = a_1 + (8 - 1)d = \\frac{49}{3} + 7 \\times \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\na_8 = \\frac{49}{3} + \\frac{14}{3} = \\frac{63}{3} = 21\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So, \\(a_8 = 21\\).\n- Let me think: This seems like a reasonable value, considering the sequence progresses with a small fractional difference.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Let's check by adding the common difference repeatedly from the second term:\n  - \\(a_2 = 17\\)\n  - \\(a_3 = 17 + \\frac{2}{3} = 17 + 0.67 = 17.67\\) (approximately)\n  - \\(a_4 = 17.67 + \\frac{2}{3} = 18.34\\) (approximately)\n  - \\(a_5 = 19\\) (given)\n  - Continuing this, \\(a_8\\) should also align with the pattern.\n\n**Estimation:**\n- Quick estimation shows that adding \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) three times to \\(19\\) aligns:\n\\[\n19 + 3 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 19 + 2 = 21\n\\]\n- This matches our calculated \\(a_8\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Checkpoints Completed:** Each step logically followed from the previous one. The calculations aligned with the given terms, and the checks confirmed the correctness.\n- **Consistency:** The common difference and the first term make sense together, and the arithmetic sequence formula was applied correctly.\n- **No Mistakes Found:** Initially, I considered different strategies, but the straightforward application of the arithmetic sequence formula worked well. Alternative methods like observing the difference helped confirm the approach.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully exploring different strategies, setting up and solving equations, and checking each step along the way, the eighth term of the arithmetic sequence is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{21}\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$.  Then the second term is $a + d = 17$, fifth term is $a + 4d = 19$, and the eighth term is $a + 7d$.  Note that $(a + 4d) - (a + d) = 3d$, and $(a + 7d) - (a + 4d) = 3d$, so the terms $a + d = 17$, $a + 4d = 19$, and $a + 7d$ also form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nIf 17 and 19 are consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence, then the common difference is $19 - 17 = 2$, so the next term must be $19 + 2 = \\boxed{21}$."
