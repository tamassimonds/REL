    "working_out": "First Thoughts \n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We have three distinct complex numbers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), each satisfying the same cubic equation: \n\\[\na^3 = 2a + 5, \\\\\nb^3 = 2b + 5, \\\\\nc^3 = 2c + 5.\n\\]\n\nFrom the outset, this looks like a polynomial equations problem, maybe something involving roots or factoring. When I see cubic equations, I often think about possible factorizations or applying the Rational Root Theorem to find possible real roots. But then, I notice that all three equations are identical, which makes me think there might be a clever way to leverage this.\n\nOne initial idea is to combine the equations somehow to isolate \\(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\\). Perhaps adding them up could reveal something interesting. Alternatively, maybe think about the properties of roots of unity since the equations are identical for all three variables.\n\nHowever, waiting a minute\u2014if \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are distinct roots of the same cubic equation, does that imply they are all roots of a single polynomial equation? I think it does. This leads me to consider whether Vieta's formulas could be applicable here.\n\nLet me brainstorm a bit more:\n\n1. **Factorization Approach:** Attempt to factor the cubic equation to find individual roots.\n2. **Symmetry and Addition:** Sum the equations and see if that simplifies the problem.\n3. **Vieta's Formulas:** Use relationships between the roots of polynomials to find necessary sums.\n\nAt this point, I'm leaning towards starting with the **Symmetry and Addition** approach because it directly targets \\(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\\) by adding the equations. If that doesn't work out, I can consider factoring or Vieta's. \n\n**Step 1: Adding the Equations Together**\n\nLet's try adding all three equations to see what we get:\n\\[\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (2a + 5) + (2b + 5) + (2c + 5).\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 2(a + b + c) + 15.\n\\]\n\nImmediately, I'm struck by how this relates to the sum of the roots. If I can figure out \\(a + b + c\\), then the entire expression becomes clear. However, the problem doesn't provide \\(a + b + c\\) directly, so I need to think of another way to find it.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, adding the equations gives a nice expression, but without knowing \\(a + b + c\\), I'm stuck. This isn't helping me directly. Maybe I need to pivot a bit from this direction.\n\n**Step 2: Considering Factoring the Cubic Equation**\n\nSince adding the equations didn't lead directly to a solution, let's consider factoring the cubic equation. Perhaps finding roots individually could help.\n\nThe given equation is:\n\\[\nx^3 - 2x - 5 = 0.\n\\]\n\nI recall that solving cubic equations analytically can be involved, but maybe I can identify a rational root using the **Rational Root Theorem**. According to this theorem, possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this case, the constant term is \\(-5\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(1\\), so possible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 5\\).\n\nLet me test these:\n\n- **Testing \\(x = 1\\):**\n  \\[\n  1^3 - 2(1) - 5 = 1 - 2 - 5 = -6 \\quad (\\text{Not a root})\n  \\]\n- **Testing \\(x = -1\\):**\n  \\[\n  (-1)^3 - 2(-1) - 5 = -1 + 2 - 5 = -4 \\quad (\\text{Not a root})\n  \\]\n- **Testing \\(x = 5\\):**\n  \\[\n  5^3 - 2(5) - 5 = 125 - 10 - 5 = 110 \\quad (\\text{Not a root})\n  \\]\n- **Testing \\(x = -5\\):**\n  \\[\n  (-5)^3 - 2(-5) - 5 = -125 + 10 - 5 = -120 \\quad (\\text{Not a root})\n  \\]\n\nWait, none of these are rational roots. This suggests that the roots might not be rational, or I made an error in my testing. Let me double-check. No, the calculations seem correct, so perhaps the roots are irrational or complex.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, the Rational Root Theorem isn\u2019t helping me here. Maybe factoring isn't the best approach since none of the possible rational roots work. I need to think of an alternative strategy.\n\n**Step 3: Thinking About Vieta\u2019s Formulas**\n\nSince factoring didn't work, let's consider **Vieta's Formulas**, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots.\n\nFor a cubic equation \\(x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0\\), if \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the roots, then:\n\n1. \\(a + b + c = -p\\),\n2. \\(ab + ac + bc = q\\),\n3. \\(abc = -r\\).\n\nIn our equation:\n\\[\nx^3 - 2x - 5 = 0,\n\\]\nso:\n\n- \\(a + b + c = 0\\),\n- \\(ab + ac + bc = -2\\),\n- \\(abc = 5\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute. I can see now that adding the original equations doesn't directly help unless I know \\(a + b + c\\). But according to Vieta's, \\(a + b + c = 0\\). That\u2019s a key insight! Let\u2019s revisit the addition from **Step 1** with this new information.\n\n**Step 4: Revisiting the Addition with \\(a + b + c = 0\\)**\n\nNow, knowing that \\(a + b + c = 0\\), let's go back to the expression we derived:\n\\[\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 2(a + b + c) + 15.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(a + b + c = 0\\):\n\\[\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 2(0) + 15 = 15.\n\\]\n\n**Final Checking:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Let\u2019s see:\n\n- The addition of the three equations simplifies neatly using \\(a + b + c = 0\\).\n- Vieta\u2019s formulas confirm the relationship between the roots and the coefficients.\n- The arithmetic checks out.\n\nEverything aligns logically, so the final answer seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\na^3 + b^3 + c^3 = \\boxed{15}.\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThinking back through the process:\n\n- Initially, adding the equations didn\u2019t lead directly to the answer because I overlooked the sum of the roots.\n- Recognizing that \\(a + b + c = 0\\) from Vieta\u2019s formulas was crucial.\n- This insight allowed me to simplify the expression and arrive at the correct answer.\n\nIt's always helpful to reconsider all possible strategies and check if there's a simpler path, as it was the case here with Vieta's formulas.",
