So, I need to ensure I'm only focusing on the composite ones.\n- **Hmm**, maybe I need to find a common multiple of these composite numbers, but that seems a bit vague initially. \n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM):** This makes sense because the LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is divisible by all of them.\n   \n2. **List the Composite Numbers and Their Multiples:** Perhaps listing each composite number and finding their multiples to see where they intersect could work.\n   \n3. **Prime Factorization Approach:** Break down each composite number into its prime factors and then find the LCM based on these primes.\n\n4. **Trial and Error with Multiples:** Start checking multiples of the largest composite number to see if they're divisible by all the others.\n\n**Initial Thoughts on Strategies:**\n\n- The **LCM** approach seems the most straightforward since we're looking for a number divisible by all given composites.\n- **Listing multiples** might be time-consuming and cumbersome, especially as numbers get larger.\n- **Prime factorization** sounds efficient, but I need to be careful to account for all necessary primes and their powers.\n- **Trial and error** might work, but it could be hit-or-miss and wouldn't systematically guarantee the correct answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Let's start with the **LCM** approach because it directly addresses the requirement of being divisible by all specified numbers.\n\n### Step 2: **Identifying the First Five Composite Numbers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the LCM, I need to know which numbers I'm dealing with.\n- **Wait**, what exactly are the first five **composite** numbers? \n- I remember that composite numbers are those greater than 1 that aren't prime.\n  \n**Recalling Composite Numbers:**\n\n1. **4** (2 \u00d7 2)\n2. **6** (2 \u00d7 3)\n3. **8** (2 \u00d7 4)\n4. **9** (3 \u00d7 3)\n5. **10** (2 \u00d7 5)\n\n- **Hmm**, that seems right. These are the smallest integers greater than 1 that aren't prime.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Does this list make sense? **Yes**, all these numbers are composite as they have divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\n### Step 3: **Applying the Least Common Multiple (LCM) Concept**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I have the composite numbers (4, 6, 8, 9, 10), I need to find their LCM.\n- The **LCM** is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all these numbers.\n  \n**Exploring the LCM Method:**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Approach:**\n   - Break each composite number into its prime factors.\n   \n2. **Build the LCM:**\n   - Combine the highest powers of all prime factors involved.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait**, before diving into prime factorization, let me quickly check if there's a more straightforward way.\n- **Hmm**, perhaps checking if there's a pattern or using the largest number as a starting point could help, but since we're looking for the least, starting with LCM seems best.\n\n### Step 4: **Prime Factorization of Each Composite Number**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let\u2019s break down each composite number into its prime factors to see which primes and their powers are needed for the LCM.\n  \n**Listing Prime Factorizations:**\n\n1. **4:** \n   - Prime factors: \\(2^2\\)\n   \n2. **6:** \n   - Prime factors: \\(2 \\times 3\\)\n   \n3. **8:** \n   - Prime factors: \\(2^3\\)\n   \n4. **9:** \n   - Prime factors: \\(3^2\\)\n   \n5. **10:** \n   - Prime factors: \\(2 \\times 5\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Let me check:** \n  - Highest power of 2 is \\(2^3\\) from 8.\n  - Highest power of 3 is \\(3^2\\) from 9.\n  - Prime 5 appears in 10.\n\n- **Wait, I need to ensure all primes are covered with their highest powers.**\n\n### Step 5: **Constructing the LCM Using Prime Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the LCM, multiply the highest powers of all unique prime factors involved in the composite numbers.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM} = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\n\\]\n\n- **Breakdown:**\n  - \\(2^3\\) (from 8)\n  - \\(3^2\\) (from 9)\n  - \\(5^1\\) (from 10)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?**\n  - Yes, each prime factor\u2019s highest power is included, ensuring the LCM is divisible by all composite numbers.\n\n### Step 6: **Calculating the LCM**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, let's compute the LCM by multiplying these prime factors together.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM} = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 = 8 \\times 9 \\times 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 72 \\times 5 = 360\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick check:** \n  - Does 360 divide evenly by all composite numbers?\n  - Let\u2019s verify:\n\n    - \\(360 \\div 4 = 90\\)\n    - \\(360 \\div 6 = 60\\)\n    - \\(360 \\div 8 = 45\\)\n    - \\(360 \\div 9 = 40\\)\n    - \\(360 \\div 10 = 36\\)\n\n- **Yes,** 360 is divisible by all five composite numbers.\n\n**Checkpoint:**\n\n- **Is the answer correct?**\n  - **Yes,** the least common multiple method confirms that 360 is the smallest number divisible by all specified composites.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Started by considering both LCM and prime factorization, which led to a systematic approach.\n- **Exploring Different Strategies:** Though listing multiples and trial-and-error could work, they\u2019re less efficient than prime factorization.\n- **Reflection Throughout:** Regular checks ensured that each step logically followed and that the final answer was correct.\n- **Conclusion:** The least positive integer divisible by each of the first five composite numbers is **360**.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n1. **Identified the first five composite numbers:** 4, 6, 8, 9, 10.\n2. **Applied the LCM concept:** Utilized prime factorization to find the lowest common multiple.\n3. **Calculated the LCM:** Multiplying the highest powers of all unique prime factors resulted in 360.\n4. **Verified the solution:** Ensured that 360 is divisible by all specified composite numbers, confirming its correctness.\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step and continuously reflecting on the methodology, we confidently arrived at the correct solution.",
