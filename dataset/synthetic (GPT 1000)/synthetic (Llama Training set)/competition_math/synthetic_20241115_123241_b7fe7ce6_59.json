    "working_out": "Alright, let's take a deep dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just as I would if I were tackling it myself, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work regularly, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, so the problem asks for the equation of a parabola with a specific vertex \\((2, 4)\\), a vertical axis of symmetry, and that passes through the point \\((1, 1)\\). I need to express the equation in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Parabola Basics:** I remember that parabolas can be written in vertex form, which is \\[y = a(x - h)^2 + k\\], where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex. Since the axis of symmetry is vertical, this makes sense.\n- **Given Vertex:** The vertex is \\((2, 4)\\), so the equation in vertex form would start as \\[y = a(x - 2)^2 + 4\\].\n- **Additional Point:** I have the point \\((1, 1)\\) that lies on the parabola, which should help me find the value of \\(a\\).\n- **Goal:** Finally, I need to convert this equation from vertex form to the standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\).\n\n**Initial Strategy:**\nI\u2019ll start by plugging the given point \\((1, 1)\\) into the vertex form equation to find \\(a\\). Then, I\u2019ll expand the equation to get it into the standard form.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Given Point to Find \\(a\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s substitute the x and y values of the point \\((1, 1)\\) into the vertex form equation to solve for \\(a\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nStarting with the vertex form:\n\\[\ny = a(x - 2)^2 + 4\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\):\n\\[\n1 = a(1 - 2)^2 + 4\n\\]\n\\[\n1 = a(-1)^2 + 4\n\\]\n\\[\n1 = a(1) + 4\n\\]\n\\[\n1 = a + 4\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(a\\):**\n\\[\na = 1 - 4 = -3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait a minute, does \\(a = -3\\) make sense? Let me quickly verify by plugging \\(a\\) back into the vertex form with the given point.\n\n\\[\ny = -3(1 - 2)^2 + 4\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -3(1)^2 + 4\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -3 + 4 = 1\n\\]\n\nYep, it checks out. So, \\(a = -3\\) is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe value of \\(a\\) is negative, which indicates that the parabola opens downwards. This aligns with the vertex being at \\((2, 4)\\) and the point \\((1, 1)\\) lying below the vertex.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Writing the Vertex Form Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I know \\(a = -3\\), I can write the equation of the parabola in vertex form.\n\n**Equation:**\n\\[\ny = -3(x - 2)^2 + 4\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nLet\u2019s quickly verify if this equation passes through the point \\((1, 1)\\).\n\n\\[\ny = -3(1 - 2)^2 + 4\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -3(-1)^2 + 4\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -3(1) + 4\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -3 + 4 = 1\n\\]\n\nYes, it passes through \\((1, 1)\\). Everything looks good up to now.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Converting to Standard Form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo express the parabola in the standard form, I need to expand the vertex form equation. Let\u2019s do that carefully.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nStart with:\n\\[\ny = -3(x - 2)^2 + 4\n\\]\n\nFirst, expand \\((x - 2)^2\\):\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute back into the equation:\n\\[\ny = -3(x^2 - 4x + 4) + 4\n\\]\n\nDistribute \\(-3\\):\n\\[\ny = -3x^2 + 12x - 12 + 4\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\ny = -3x^2 + 12x - 8\n\\]\n\n**Final Equation:**\n\\[\ny = -3x^2 + 12x - 8\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Final Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIt\u2019s crucial to ensure that this final equation satisfies all the given conditions: the vertex, the axis of symmetry, and the additional point.\n\n**Check:**\n\n1. **Vertex:** The vertex is \\((2, 4)\\).\n   - In the equation \\(y = -3x^2 + 12x - 8\\), the x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using \\(\\frac{-b}{2a}\\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-12}{2(-3)} = \\frac{-12}{-6} = 2\n     \\]\n   - Plugging \\(x = 2\\) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     y = -3(2)^2 + 12(2) - 8 = -3(4) + 24 - 8 = -12 + 24 - 8 = 4\n     \\]\n   - So, the vertex is indeed \\((2, 4)\\).\n\n2. **Axis of Symmetry:** Since the parabola is vertical, the axis of symmetry is \\(x = 2\\), which matches the vertex\u2019s x-coordinate.\n\n3. **Additional Point:** The point \\((1, 1)\\) lies on the parabola.\n   - Substitute \\(x = 1\\) into the equation:\n     \\[\n     y = -3(1)^2 + 12(1) - 8 = -3 + 12 - 8 = 1\n     \\]\n   - The corresponding \\(y\\)-value is 1, which matches the given point.\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The final equation satisfies all the conditions provided in the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies and carefully applying the given conditions step by step, I determined that the equation of the parabola is:\n\n\\[\ny = -3x^2 + 12x - 8\n\\]\n\nThroughout the process, I ensured to:\n- Verify each step with quick checks.\n- Reflect on whether the approach made sense.\n- Adjust the strategy if something didn\u2019t seem right.\n\nBy doing this, I confirmed the correctness of the final equation.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the axis of symmetry is vertical and the vertex is $(2,4)$, the parabola may also be written as  \\[y=a(x-2)^2+4\\] for some value of $a$.  Plugging the point $(1,1)$ into this expression gives  \\[1=a(1-2)^2+4=a+4.\\] This tells us $a=-3$.\n\nOur equation is  \\[y=-3(x-2)^2+4.\\] Putting it $y=ax^2+bx+c$ form requires expanding the square, so we get  \\[y=-3(x^2-4x+4)+4=\\boxed{-3x^2+12x-8}.\\]"
