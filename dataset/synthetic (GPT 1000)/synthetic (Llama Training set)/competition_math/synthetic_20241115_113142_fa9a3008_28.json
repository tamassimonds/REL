I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at the problem: \n\n**The graphs of \\(y = x^4\\) and \\(y = 5x^2 - 6\\) intersect at four points with \\(x\\)-coordinates \\(\\pm \\sqrt{m}\\) and \\(\\pm \\sqrt{n}\\), where \\(m > n\\). What is \\(m - n\\)?**\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Intersection Points:** This immediately makes me think about finding points where two functions are equal. So, setting \\(x^4 = 5x^2 - 6\\) seems like a natural starting point.\n- **Quadratic Nature:** The presence of \\(x^4\\) and \\(x^2\\) suggests that maybe I can transform the equation into a quadratic form. Quadratics are often easier to handle!\n- **Symmetry:** The \\(x\\)-coordinates being \\(\\pm \\sqrt{m}\\) and \\(\\pm \\sqrt{n}\\) hints at symmetry in the roots. Maybe this can help simplify things.\n\nBut honestly, I'm feeling a bit unsure. Quadratics are usually straightforward, but with \\(x^4\\) involved, I wonder if there's a cleaner method or if I\u2019m overcomplicating it.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Set the Equations Equal:** Start by solving \\(x^4 = 5x^2 - 6\\).\n2. **Substitution Method:** Let\u2019s make a substitution to simplify the equation.\n3. **Graphical Approach:** Sketch the graphs to visually identify the intersection points (but this is more of a sanity check).\n4. **Check for Symmetry:** Leverage the symmetry in the roots to potentially simplify the calculations.\n\nI'm leaning towards the first strategy: setting the equations equal. But I'm also considering substitution to make it easier. Let's try that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's start by finding where the two graphs intersect. If I set \\(y = x^4\\) equal to \\(y = 5x^2 - 6\\), I should be able to find the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points.\n\n**Setting the Equations Equal:**\n\n\\[ \nx^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, this looks like a polynomial equation. It\u2019s quartic (degree 4), which can be tricky. Maybe there's a better way to handle it by substituting variables to reduce the degree.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Considering Substitution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI remember that when dealing with \\(x^4\\) and \\(x^2\\), a common technique is to make a substitution that turns the equation into a quadratic. This might make it easier to solve.\n\n**Substitution Idea:**\n\nLet\u2019s substitute \\(u = x^2\\). Then, \\(x^4 = (x^2)^2 = u^2\\).\n\n**Rewriting the Equation:**\n\n\\[ \nu^2 = 5u - 6 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, this looks much cleaner! Now I have a quadratic equation in terms of \\(u\\). Quadratics are generally easier to solve than quartics.\n\nBut wait, let\u2019s double-check if this substitution makes sense. Since \\(u = x^2\\), and \\(x^4 = u^2\\), substituting \\(u = x^2\\) seems logical because it reduces the degree of the polynomial.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have a quadratic equation, I can solve for \\(u\\) using the quadratic formula.\n\n**Quadratic Equation:**\n\n\\[ \nu^2 - 5u + 6 = 0 \n\\]\n\n**Quadratic Formula:**\n\n\\[\nu = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(a = 1\\)\n- \\(b = -5\\)\n- \\(c = 6\\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nu = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 6}}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\\[\nu = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 24}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nu = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nu = \\frac{5 \\pm 1}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nu = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad u = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute! We have two solutions for \\(u\\): \\(u = 3\\) and \\(u = 2\\). Since \\(u = x^2\\), both solutions are valid because \\(x^2\\) can be positive.\n\nBut let me think about the problem\u2019s requirement: the \\(x\\)-coordinates are \\(\\pm \\sqrt{m}\\) and \\(\\pm \\sqrt{n}\\), with \\(m > n\\). I need to map these \\(u\\) values to \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).\n\nHold on, if \\(u = 3\\), then \\(x^2 = 3\\), which implies \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{3}\\). Similarly, if \\(u = 2\\), then \\(x^2 = 2\\), so \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nThis aligns with the given \\(x\\)-coordinates: \\(\\pm \\sqrt{m}\\) and \\(\\pm \\sqrt{n}\\). Therefore, \\(m = 3\\) and \\(n = 2\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determining \\(m - n\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFinally, the problem asks for \\(m - n\\). Now that I've identified \\(m = 3\\) and \\(n = 2\\), I can simply subtract them.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nm - n = 3 - 2 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense. The \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points are \\(\\pm \\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(\\pm \\sqrt{2}\\), with \\(\\sqrt{3} > \\sqrt{2}\\), so \\(m = 3\\) and \\(n = 2\\).\n\nI\u2019ll do a quick check to ensure everything aligns with the problem's requirements:\n\n- The substitution \\(u = x^2\\) was valid.\n- Both \\(u = 3\\) and \\(u = 2\\) correspond to real \\(x\\)-values.\n- The symmetry in the roots is reflected correctly in \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nLooking back, the substitution method worked well to simplify the original quartic equation into a quadratic one. This made it much easier to solve for the \\(x^2\\) values, which directly corresponded to the \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) in the problem.\n\nAt first, I considered solving the quartic equation directly, but then realized that substituting \\(u = x^2\\) would likely be more efficient. Checking each step ensured that the mapping from \\(u\\) to \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) was correct.\n\nOverall, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying calculations led to the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nm-n\n\n1\n\n\u200b",
