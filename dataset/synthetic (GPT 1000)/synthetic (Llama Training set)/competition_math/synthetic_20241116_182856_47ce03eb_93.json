    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. It's important to emulate a human thought process, complete with brainstorming, reflection, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question, my immediate reaction is to **visualize** the diagram. It mentions that rectangle \\(PQRS\\) is divided into **three identical squares**, and its **perimeter is 120 cm**. The goal is to find the **area** of the rectangle.\n\n- **Brainstorming:**\n  - **Identify Dimensions:** Since there are three identical squares, the rectangle's length and width must relate to the squares' sides.\n  - **Perimeter Equation:** The perimeter of a rectangle is \\(2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\\). I can set up an equation using the given perimeter.\n  - **Area Calculation:** Once I have the dimensions, calculating the area should be straightforward.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how the squares fit into the rectangle. Do they span the length, the width, or both? Let's explore different strategies to clarify this.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Squares Aligned Along Length Only:**\n   - **Assumption:** The three squares are placed side by side along the rectangle's length.\n   - **Implication:** The width of the rectangle would be equal to the side length of one square.\n\n2. **Squares Aligned Along Width Only:**\n   - **Assumption:** The three squares are stacked vertically along the rectangle's width.\n   - **Implication:** The length of the rectangle would be equal to the side length of one square.\n\n3. **Mixed Alignment:**\n   - **Assumption:** Perhaps the squares are arranged both horizontally and vertically, but this seems less likely since \"identical\" squares usually imply uniform alignment.\n\n**Reflection:** The most straightforward and common arrangement would be to have the three squares aligned either along the length or the width. Since the question doesn't specify, I lean towards the **first strategy**: squares aligned along the rectangle's length.\n\n**Thought Process:** If this doesn't work, I'll reconsider and try the second strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Step Using Strategy 1: Squares Aligned Along Length**\n\n#### **Step 1: Define Variables**\n\n- Let the side length of each square be \\(s\\).\n- Since there are three squares aligned along the length, the **length** of the rectangle \\(L = 3s\\).\n- The **width** \\(W = s\\) since the squares are also as wide as their sides.\n\n#### **Step 2: Set Up the Perimeter Equation**\n\nThe perimeter \\(P\\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (L + W)\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(P = 120\\) cm, substitute \\(L\\) and \\(W\\):\n\n\\[\n120 = 2 \\times (3s + s) \\\\\n120 = 2 \\times 4s \\\\\n120 = 8s\n\\]\n\n#### **Step 3: Solve for \\(s\\)**\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{120}{8} = 15 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** \n- Does this make sense? If \\(s = 15\\) cm, then:\n  - Length \\(L = 3s = 45\\) cm\n  - Width \\(W = s = 15\\) cm\n  - Perimeter \\(P = 2 \\times (45 + 15) = 2 \\times 60 = 120\\) cm \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:** The perimeter checks out perfectly. This suggests that our initial assumption about the squares being aligned along the length is likely correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Strategy 1: Calculating the Area**\n\n#### **Step 4: Calculate the Area \\(A\\) of Rectangle \\(PQRS\\)**\n\nThe area of a rectangle is:\n\n\\[\nA = L \\times W\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we've found:\n\n\\[\nA = 45 \\text{ cm} \\times 15 \\text{ cm} = 675 \\text{ cm}^2\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Multiply 45 by 15:\n  - \\(45 \\times 10 = 450\\)\n  - \\(45 \\times 5 = 225\\)\n  - Adding them: \\(450 + 225 = 675\\) cm\u00b2 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:** The area calculation seems straightforward and consistent with the dimensions derived from the perimeter.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy Check: Squares Aligned Along Width**\n\nJust to ensure our solution is robust, let's briefly explore the second strategy where the squares are aligned along the rectangle's width.\n\n#### **Step 5: Define Variables for Alternative Strategy**\n\n- Let the side length of each square be \\(s\\).\n- Length \\(L = s\\)\n- Width \\(W = 3s\\)\n\n#### **Step 6: Set Up the Perimeter Equation**\n\n\\[\n120 = 2 \\times (s + 3s) \\\\\n120 = 2 \\times 4s \\\\\n120 = 8s \\\\\ns = 15 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n**Result:**\n- Length \\(L = s = 15\\) cm\n- Width \\(W = 3s = 45\\) cm\n- Area \\(A = 15 \\times 45 = 675\\) cm\u00b2\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Consistency:** Both strategies lead to the same value for the side length \\(s\\) and the same area \\(A\\).\n- **Conclusion:** This confirms that our initial approach was correct. The alignment of the squares along either the length or width yields consistent results.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Verifying the Solution**\n\n- **Perimeter Verification:** Substituting \\(s = 15\\) cm back into the perimeter equation confirms the given perimeter of 120 cm.\n- **Area Consistency:** Both strategies provide the same area, ensuring the solution's validity regardless of square alignment.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe area of rectangle \\(PQRS\\) is **675 square centimeters**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Exploration:** Started by brainstorming different ways the squares could be arranged within the rectangle.\n- **Strategy Selection:** Chose the most straightforward approach\u2014aligning the squares along the rectangle's length.\n- **Step-by-Step Calculation:** Defined variables, set up the perimeter equation, solved for side length, and calculated the area.\n- **Alternative Check:** Briefly explored aligning squares along the width to confirm consistency.\n- **Verification:** Ensured all calculations aligned with the given perimeter and consistently led to the same area.\n\nBy reflecting throughout and checking each step, we confidently arrived at the correct solution.",
