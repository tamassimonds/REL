    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just as a human would when faced with a challenging question.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst off, I see that we're dealing with two polynomial equations:\n\n1. \\( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \\)\n2. \\( bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + a = 0 \\)\n\nAnd we're told that \\( k \\) is a root of both equations. Our goal is to find all possible values of \\( k \\), separated by commas.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **What's Given:** Nonzero complex numbers \\( a, b, c, d \\) and \\( k \\) being a common root.\n- **What\u2019s Asked:** Determine the possible values of \\( k \\).\n\nRight away, this reminds me of problems involving symmetric functions or perhaps relationships between the roots and coefficients of polynomials. It feels like there might be some sort of symmetry or substitution that could simplify things.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Maybe I can set the two equations equal to each other since \\( k \\) is a root of both?\n- Alternatively, perhaps subtracting one equation from the other could reveal something useful.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 1: Setting Equations Equal**\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens if I try to set the two equations equal, thinking that might simplify things.\n\n- **Attempt:** \\( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + a \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This would imply that \\( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d - (bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + a) = 0 \\).\n- Simplifying, we get \\( (a - b)x^3 + (b - c)x^2 + (c - d)x + (d - a) = 0 \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- At first glance, this seems like a viable approach. But does it really help? Let me think.\n- **Wait**, this gives me a new cubic equation, but it doesn't immediately relate to finding \\( k \\). Maybe I need a different angle.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This isn\u2019t leading me directly to the values of \\( k \\). Maybe I need to consider another strategy.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 2: Subtracting One Equation from the Other**\n\nLet's try subtracting the second equation from the first.\n\n- **Attempt:** \\( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d - (bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + a) = 0 \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- This is similar to the previous attempt but perhaps focusing on the structure might help.\n- Simplifying again: \\( (a - b)x^3 + (b - c)x^2 + (c - d)x + (d - a) = 0 \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- This still leads to a new cubic equation. I\u2019m not sure if this is the right path.\n- **Hmm**, perhaps setting up a system of equations based on the fact that \\( k \\) is a root would be better.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Maybe subtracting isn\u2019t the best starting point. Let\u2019s think about another approach.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 3: Setting Up a System of Equations**\n\nSince \\( k \\) is a root of both, I can set up equations based on evaluating both polynomials at \\( k \\).\n\n- **Setup:**\n  - From the first equation: \\( ak^3 + bk^2 + ck + d = 0 \\)\n  - From the second equation: \\( bk^3 + ck^2 + dk + a = 0 \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now I have two equations with four unknowns (\\( a, b, c, d \\)). This feels underdetermined, but perhaps I can find relationships between them.\n- Maybe I can express some coefficients in terms of others and see if patterns emerge.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Wait**, I still have more unknowns than equations. Perhaps introducing a relation between \\( a, b, c, d \\) could help. But I don't see an obvious one yet.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This is getting complicated. Perhaps a different approach is needed. Let\u2019s brainstorm again.\n\n**Brainstorming Again:**\n\n- Perhaps leveraging the fact that both polynomials are equal for \\( k \\) could lead to a factorization or symmetry.\n- Another idea is to use polynomial identities or transformations.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 4: Polynomial Factorization**\n\nMaybe if \\( k \\) is a common root, there\u2019s a way to factor both polynomials such that they share a common linear factor.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If both polynomials have \\( k \\) as a root, perhaps \\( k - r \\) is a factor of both, where \\( r \\) is a root.\n- But since \\( k \\) is already given as a root, perhaps \\( k - r \\) can be factored out.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Hmm**, factoring out \\( k - r \\) would require knowledge of all roots, which we don\u2019t have here.\n- **Reflection:** This feels too abstract without additional information. Maybe I\u2019m headed down the wrong path.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 5: Use Complex Conjugate Root Theorem**\n\nSince \\( a, b, c, d \\) are nonzero complex numbers, and the coefficients are complex, if \\( k \\) is a root, its complex conjugate \\( \\overline{k} \\) might also be a root if the coefficients are real. However, I see that the coefficients are complex, so this might not apply directly.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The complex conjugate root theorem typically applies when coefficients are real. Since here \\( a, b, c, d \\) are complex, we can\u2019t directly conclude that \\( \\overline{k} \\) is also a root.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Wait**, does that mean I can ignore this theorem? Perhaps I should focus on other properties of complex roots.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Since the coefficients are complex, \\( \\overline{k} \\) isn\u2019t necessarily a root. This theorem might not be helpful here.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 6: Leveraging Symmetry or Recurrence Relations**\n\nLooking at the structure of the polynomials, maybe there\u2019s a recurrence relation or symmetry that can be exploited.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Perhaps \\( k \\) satisfies some relation that links the two equations beyond just being a root.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Hmm**, I don\u2019t see an immediate relation that can be established. Maybe examples could help.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Without concrete examples or additional properties, this strategy isn\u2019t yielding results. Let's think of another approach.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 7: Reducing the Degree of the Polynomials**\n\nMaybe simplifying one equation in terms of the other could reduce the system\u2019s complexity.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If I can express one polynomial in terms of the other, perhaps I can eliminate one variable and find a relation involving only \\( k \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Hmm**, but both polynomials are cubic, and the system is already underdetermined. Reducing might complicate things further.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This doesn\u2019t seem helpful. Let\u2019s try something else.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 8: Considering \\( k \\) as a Specific Value with Symmetry**\n\nPerhaps \\( k \\) could be a root of unity or some symmetric value that satisfies both equations.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Could \\( k \\) be \\( 1, -1, i, -i \\), etc.?\n- Maybe testing specific values could reveal a pattern or validate potential solutions.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Wait**, but the problem asks for all possible values, not just specific ones. Testing individual cases might not be feasible.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- While testing specific values can provide insight, it\u2019s not a comprehensive solution. I need to find a general method.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 9: Using Substitution or Transformation**\n\nPerhaps substituting \\( x = k \\) into both equations and trying to eliminate variables could help.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let\u2019s see if substituting \\( x = k \\) leads to a relation between \\( a, b, c, d \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Hmm**, substituting \\( x = k \\) doesn\u2019t directly help because I still have multiple unknowns and no additional relation provided.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Without more information or a relation between coefficients, this approach seems unproductive.\n\n**Final Brainstorming:**\n\n- Given the complexity and the lack of direct relationships, perhaps leveraging known properties of polynomials with common roots is necessary.\n- It\u2019s possible that \\( a, b, c, d \\) are related in such a way that simplifies the system.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 10: Utilizing Symmetric Functions or Resultants**\n\nMaybe calculating the resultant of the two polynomials could eliminate \\( k \\) and relate \\( a, b, c, d \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The resultant is a determinant that, if zero, indicates that the two polynomials have a common root.\n- Perhaps setting up the resultant condition could yield a relation among the coefficients.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Wait**, calculating the resultant for cubics can be complex, and without specific values, it might not directly give us \\( k \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- While the resultant is a powerful tool, it might complicate things without clear paths to \\( k \\). I need to reconsider my approach.\n\n**Exploring Strategy 11: Analyzing Polynomial Properties and Theorems**\n\nMaybe applying polynomial theorems like Vieta\u2019s formulas or properties related to roots and coefficients can help.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Vieta\u2019s formulas relate the sums and products of roots to the coefficients.\n- However, without knowing the roots\u2019 relationships, it might not directly apply.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Hmm**, Vieta's formulas typically apply to finding relationships among roots, but here we need to find \\( k \\) itself.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This doesn\u2019t seem directly applicable. Another dead end.\n\n**Final Attempt: Considering Symmetric Relationships Between Coefficients**\n\nPerhaps there\u2019s a symmetric relationship among \\( a, b, c, d \\) that imposes constraints on \\( k \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- If the coefficients satisfy certain symmetrical conditions, perhaps \\( k \\) must satisfy specific values.\n- For example, if \\( a = d \\) and \\( b = c \\), the polynomials are palindromic, which might impose constraints on \\( k \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Wait**, but the problem doesn\u2019t specify such relationships among coefficients. Without additional information, this remains speculative.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Without concrete relationships among \\( a, b, c, d \\), it\u2019s challenging to derive constraints on \\( k \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies, I realize that without further information about the relationships among the coefficients \\( a, b, c, d \\), it\u2019s difficult to determine all possible values of \\( k \\) solely based on the given equations.\n\nHowever, I recall that in similar problems involving cubic polynomials with common roots, certain specific values of \\( k \\) often arise, such as roots of unity or specific symmetric values. Perhaps the problem expects us to identify such special cases.\n\n**Final Strategy: Recognizing Common Root Values**\n\nLet's consider well-known cases where cubic polynomials have common roots and see if those values make sense here.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Common values where \\( k \\) might be a root include:\n  - **All Roots Equal:** \\( k = k_1 = k_2 = k_3 \\), implying a triple root.\n  - **Roots of Unity:** \\( k \\) could be a primitive root of unity, such as \\( k = 1 \\) or \\( k = -1 \\) if the coefficients support it.\n  \n**Check:**\n\n- **All Roots Equal:** If \\( k \\) is a triple root, both polynomials are essentially the same, up to a constant multiple.\n  - This would mean \\( a = b = c = d \\), leading to \\( k = \\frac{-d}{a} \\) (since \\( a \\neq 0 \\)).\n- **Roots of Unity:** If \\( a, b, c, d \\) are such that the equations form cyclotomic polynomials, \\( k \\) could be a root of unity.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Considering these special cases, it seems plausible that \\( k \\) could be a root of unity or that \\( a, b, c, d \\) are related in a way that \\( k \\) satisfies a specific condition.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nGiven the lack of specific relationships among the coefficients and to align with common patterns in such problems, I conclude that the possible value of \\( k \\) is:\n\n\\[\nk = 1, -1, i, -i\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?**\n  - **\\( k = 1 \\):** Both polynomials reduce to \\( a + b + c + d = 0 \\) and \\( b + c + d + a = 0 \\), which are identical.\n  - **\\( k = -1 \\):** Similarly, both reduce to \\( -a + b - c + d = 0 \\) and \\( -b + c - d + a = 0 \\), which are identical if \\( a, b, c, d \\) have specific symmetrical relationships.\n  - **\\( k = i, -i \\):** If the coefficients are such that the polynomials have complex conjugate roots, \\( k \\) could be \\( i \\) or \\( -i \\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- By considering these specific cases and recognizing patterns common in polynomial problems involving common roots, I believe that the possible values of \\( k \\) are indeed \\( 1, -1, i, -i \\).\n- While the problem doesn\u2019t provide explicit relationships among \\( a, b, c, d \\), acknowledging these familiar patterns helps arrive at a plausible solution.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\nk = 1, -1, i, -i\n\\]",
