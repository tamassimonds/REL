    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, reflect frequently, and check my work as I go along. If something doesn't work, I'll backtrack and try another approach. The goal is to think through each step thoroughly, making sure everything adds up before moving on.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the equation given is \\(3z + 4i\\bar{z} = 1 - 8i\\), where \\(\\bar{z}\\) denotes the conjugate of \\(z\\). \n\nInitial thoughts:\n- **Complex Conjugates:** I remember that dealing with complex conjugates can sometimes help eliminate imaginary parts, especially if both sides of the equation are complex.\n- **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts:** Maybe separating \\(z\\) into its real and imaginary components could help. This might make it easier to solve for \\(z\\).\n- **Algebraic Manipulation:** Standard algebraic techniques might apply here, like factoring or rearranging the equation.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure which method will be the most straightforward. Let me explore a bit.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Express \\(z\\) in Terms of Its Components:**\n   - Suppose \\(z = x + yi\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are real numbers. Then, \\(\\bar{z} = x - yi\\).\n   - Substituting these into the equation might help in separating real and imaginary parts.\n\n2. **Use Complex Conjugate Properties:**\n   - Perhaps multiplying both sides by the conjugate could eliminate the imaginary unit \\(i\\).\n\n3. **Rearrange and Factor:**\n   - Trying to factor the equation after some rearrangements might lead to a simpler form.\n\nLet me start with the first strategy\u2014expressing \\(z\\) in terms of its real and imaginary components. If that seems too messy, I'll consider switching to another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Express \\(z\\) in Terms of Its Components**\n\nLet's suppose:\n\\[\nz = x + yi\n\\]\nwhere \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are real numbers.\n\nThen, the conjugate of \\(z\\) is:\n\\[\n\\bar{z} = x - yi\n\\]\n\n**Substituting into the Original Equation:**\n\nPlugging these into the equation:\n\\[\n3(x + yi) + 4i(x - yi) = 1 - 8i\n\\]\n\n**Distributing Terms:**\n\\[\n3x + 3yi + 4ix - 4y(i^2) = 1 - 8i\n\\]\n\nWait a second\u2014oh right, \\(i^2 = -1\\), so \\(-4y(i^2) = 4y\\).\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\\[\n3x + 3yi + 4ix + 4y = 1 - 8i\n\\]\n\\[\n(3x + 4y) + (3y + 4x)i = 1 - 8i\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, this looks promising. We have both the real and imaginary parts separated on each side. Let's move forward by setting the real and imaginary parts equal to each other.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Set Real and Imaginary Parts Equal**\n\nFrom the equation:\n\\[\n(3x + 4y) + (3y + 4x)i = 1 - 8i\n\\]\n\n**Real Part:**\n\\[\n3x + 4y = 1\n\\]\n\n**Imaginary Part:**\n\\[\n3y + 4x = -8\n\\]\n\n**Checking:**\n\nThis seems correct\u2014each side's real and imaginary components match. Now, I have a system of linear equations to solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**\n\nWe have:\n1. \\(3x + 4y = 1\\)\n2. \\(3y + 4x = -8\\)\n\n**Thinking:**\n\nThis is a standard system of linear equations. I can use substitution or elimination. Let me use elimination because both equations are easily manipulatable.\n\n**Elimination Method:**\n\nFirst, I\u2019ll multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 4 to align the coefficients of \\(y\\):\n\n1. \\(9x + 12y = 3\\)\n2. \\(12x + 16y = -32\\)\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\[\n(12x + 16y) - (9x + 12y) = -32 - 3\n\\]\n\\[\n3x + 4y = -35\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\n**Rechecking:**\n\nOh, I see\u2014I've mistakenly subtracted instead of adding to eliminate \\(y\\). Let me correct that.\n\n**Correct Elimination:**\n\nAdd the two modified equations:\n\n\\[\n(9x + 12y) + (12x + 16y) = 3 + (-32)\n\\]\n\\[\n21x + 28y = -29\n\\]\n\nBut that's still not right. What did I do wrong? Let's look again.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nHmm, I think I multiplied both equations incorrectly. Let me rethink this approach.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nPerhaps adding the original equations directly might work better.\n\nOriginal equations:\n1. \\(3x + 4y = 1\\)\n2. \\(3y + 4x = -8\\)\n\nAdding them:\n\\[\n(3x + 4y) + (3y + 4x) = 1 + (-8)\n\\]\n\\[\n7x + 7y = -7\n\\]\n\\[\nx + y = -1\n\\]\n\n*Wait, that's much simpler!*\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks much better. Now, we have \\(x + y = -1\\). Let's call this Equation (3).\n\nNow, I can use Equation (3) to substitute back into one of the original equations to solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Substitute Back to Find \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)**\n\nWe have:\n- Equation (1): \\(3x + 4y = 1\\)\n- Equation (3): \\(x + y = -1\\)\n\n**Solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):**\n\nFrom Equation (3), express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\):\n\\[\ny = -1 - x\n\\]\n\n**Substituting into Equation (1):**\n\\[\n3x + 4(-1 - x) = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n3x - 4 - 4x = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n-x - 4 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n-x = 5\n\\]\n\\[\nx = -5\n\\]\n\n**Finding \\(y\\):**\n\\[\nx + y = -1 \\implies -5 + y = -1\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -1 + 5 = 4\n\\]\n\n**Thus, we have:**\n\\[\nx = -5,\\quad y = 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems correct. Now, let's recall that \\(z = x + yi\\), so:\n\\[\nz = -5 + 4i\n\\]\n\nBefore finalizing, I should check whether this satisfies the original equation. But first, let me see if there's any mistake in finding \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Check: Verifying \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)**\n\nIn our alternative approach, we reached \\(x + y = -1\\) and solved for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Let's quickly substitute back to ensure correctness.\n\n**Original Equations:**\n1. \\(3(-5) + 4(4) = 1\\)\n   \\[\n   -15 + 16 = 1 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. \\(3(4) + 4(-5) = -8\\)\n   \\[\n   12 - 20 = -8 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n   \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth equations are satisfied. So, \\(x = -5\\) and \\(y = 4\\) are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finalizing \\(z\\)**\n\nNow that I have \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), I can write \\(z\\):\n\\[\nz = -5 + 4i\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense. The components match what we found through solving the system of equations. To ensure completeness, let me check if substituting \\(z\\) back into the original equation holds true.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Substitute \\(z\\) Back into the Original Equation**\n\nLet's substitute \\(z = -5 + 4i\\) and its conjugate \\(\\bar{z} = -5 - 4i\\) into the original equation:\n\n**Original Equation:**\n\\[\n3z + 4i\\bar{z} = 1 - 8i\n\\]\n\n**Calculating Left Side:**\n\\[\n3(-5 + 4i) + 4i(-5 - 4i)\n\\]\n\\[\n= (-15 + 12i) + (-20i - 16i^2)\n\\]\n\\[\n= (-15 + 12i) + (-20i + 16) \\quad \\text{(since \\(i^2 = -1\\))}\n\\]\n\\[\n= (-15 + 16) + (12i - 20i)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 - 8i\n\\]\n\n**Right Side:**\n\\[\n1 - 8i\n\\]\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nBoth sides are equal:\n\\[\n1 - 8i = 1 - 8i\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe equation is satisfied, confirming that our solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout this process, expressing \\(z\\) in terms of its real and imaginary components was a successful strategy. Initially, attempting to eliminate terms by aligning coefficients led to an unnecessary complication, but recognizing this and simplifying the system down to \\(x + y = -1\\) made the problem much more manageable.\n\nRegular checks after each major step ensured that any mistakes were caught early, preventing confusion later on. By verifying that the found \\(z\\) satisfies the original equation, we confirmed the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\nz = -5 + 4i\n\\]\n\nThis walk-through shows that brainstorming, reflecting, and checking work at each stage are crucial for solving problems accurately\u2014just like a human would when tackling a complex equation.",
