I'll walk through each step, sharing my thoughts, any initial hesitations or revelations, and ensure I check my progress frequently. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, the problem is asking for \\( g(g(2)) \\) where \\( g(x) = 2x^2 + 2x - 1 \\). At first glance, this looks like a composition of functions, which reminds me of problems where you need to evaluate a function within another function.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** \n  - I need to find \\( g(2) \\) first and then use that result as the input for \\( g(x) \\) again.\n  - It\u2019s similar to evaluating nested functions I've done before.\n  - Maybe I should jot down a plan: first compute \\( g(2) \\), then compute \\( g \\) at that result.\n\n**Exploration:**\n- **Strategy 1:** Directly compute \\( g(2) \\) and then compute \\( g \\) of that result.\n- **Strategy 2:** Perhaps look for patterns or see if there\u2019s a simpler way by analyzing the function structure.\n- **Strategy 3:** Verify if the function can be simplified or if there's a mistake in the original problem.\n\n**Checking:**\n- **Reflection:** The question seems straightforward\u2014computing \\( g(2) \\) and then \\( g \\) at that result. But I should ensure there are no hidden complexities.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 1:**\nLet\u2019s proceed with **Strategy 1**, as it aligns with standard procedures for function composition: compute the inner function first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Computing \\( g(2) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nAlright, I need to evaluate \\( g(2) \\). Let\u2019s plug \\( x = 2 \\) into the function \\( g(x) \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\ng(2) = 2(2)^2 + 2(2) - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2 \\times 4 + 4 - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 8 + 4 - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 11\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** Does 11 make sense? Yeah, the terms add up logically.\n- **Reflection:** Let me double-check: \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\), adding 4 gives 12, then subtracting 1 results in 11. Seems correct.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 2:**\n\\( g(2) = 11 \\). This part checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Computing \\( g(g(2)) = g(11) **\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need to find \\( g(11) \\). This is where I need to be careful\u2014applying the function correctly to ensure the output is accurate.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\ng(11) = 2(11)^2 + 2(11) - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2 \\times 121 + 22 - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 242 + 22 - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 264 - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 263\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** Does 263 seem reasonable? Let\u2019s see: \\( 2 \\times 121 = 242 \\), adding 22 gives 264, then subtracting 1 results in 263. Looks right.\n- **Reflection:** Wait, let me think\u2014am I sure about the multiplication and addition? Yes, multiplying 11 by itself is 121, and the rest adds up correctly.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 3:**\n\\( g(11) = 263 \\). This aligns with the calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, I should reflect on whether the steps make sense and check if there\u2019s another method to verify the answer.\n\n- **Reflection:** Each step logically follows the previous one\u2014computing \\( g(2) \\) gives 11, and then \\( g(11) \\) computes correctly to 263.\n- **Alternative Check:** Maybe re-evaluate \\( g(11) \\) using different methods, like factoring or looking for patterns, but given the straightforward structure, the direct computation seems best.\n\n**Checking:**\n- **Random Insight:** I noticed that \\( g(x) \\) is a quadratic function; perhaps I could analyze its vertex or roots, but that seems unnecessary for this problem.\n- **Final Thought:** The composition was executed correctly, and the arithmetic checks out. No need to complicate things further.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 4:**\nThe final value is **263**. Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n\\( g(g(2)) = 263 \\)\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Reflection:**\n\n- **Did I Explore Different Strategies?** Yes, initially considered direct computation and verifying through simpler methods.\n- **Did I Check My Work?** Multiple quick checks and a final verification ensured accuracy.\n- **Was There Any Mistake?** No significant errors; the approach was straightforward and aligned with mathematical norms.\n\n**Final Thought:**\nApproaching the problem step-by-step, reflecting and checking throughout ensured the answer is correct. It's always beneficial to consider multiple strategies and verify at each stage, especially with function compositions.\n\n---",
