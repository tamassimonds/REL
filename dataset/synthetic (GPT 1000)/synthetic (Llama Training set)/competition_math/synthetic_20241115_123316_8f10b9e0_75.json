    "working_out": "Absolutely, I\u2019ll approach this problem just like I would if I were solving it myself, thinking through it step by step, brainstorming various strategies, checking my work along the way, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn\u2019t seem right. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, we have the inequality \\(\\frac{x}{x + 3} \\ge 0\\). Right off the bat, I recognize that this deals with rational expressions and inequalities, which is something I\u2019ve encountered before. The goal is to find the values of \\(x\\) that make this inequality true.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Graphing Approach:** Maybe I can graph the function \\(\\frac{x}{x + 3}\\) and see where it\u2019s above or equal to zero.\n- **Algebraic Method:** Alternatively, I could factor and analyze critical points and test intervals.\n- **Sign Analysis:** Another idea is to use a sign chart to determine where the expression is positive or negative.\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, I need to consider that the denominator cannot be zero, as that would make the expression undefined. So, \\(x + 3 \\neq 0\\) or \\(x \\neq -3\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLet\u2019s start with the **Algebraic Method** to find critical points and then use **Sign Analysis** to test the intervals.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding Critical Points**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo find where \\(\\frac{x}{x + 3} = 0\\) (since the inequality includes \\(\\ge\\)), I\u2019ll set the numerator equal to zero because a fraction is zero when its numerator is zero.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nx = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, when \\(x = 0\\), the numerator is zero, making the entire fraction zero, which satisfies the inequality.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying Undefined Points**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI remembered that the denominator cannot be zero. So, I need to identify any points where \\(x + 3 = 0\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nx + 3 = 0 \\implies x = -3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Is this important?** Definitely. \\(x = -3\\) makes the denominator zero, so the expression is undefined there. I need to exclude this from my solution.\n- **Check:** If I don\u2019t exclude it, the inequality wouldn\u2019t make sense because \\(\\frac{x}{x + 3}\\) would be undefined.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Setting Up a Sign Chart**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I\u2019ll create a sign chart to determine where \\(\\frac{x}{x + 3} \\ge 0\\). This involves testing the sign of the expression in each interval defined by the critical points \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = -3\\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Intervals to Test:** I have three intervals to consider: \\((-\\infty, -3)\\), \\((-3, 0)\\), and \\((0, \\infty)\\).\n- **Testing Points:** I can pick a test point from each interval to see if the expression is positive or negative.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Is this a good approach?** Yes, because it will help me visualize where the expression is non-negative.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLet\u2019s proceed with testing each interval.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Testing Intervals**\n\n**Interval 1:** \\((-\\infty, -3)\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\nPick a test point, say \\(x = -4\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{-4}{-4 + 3} = \\frac{-4}{-1} = 4\n\\]\n**Result:** Positive\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does this align with expectations?** Yes, the fraction is positive when both numerator and denominator are negative.\n\n---\n\n**Interval 2:** \\((-3, 0)\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\nPick a test point, say \\(x = -1\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{-1}{-1 + 3} = \\frac{-1}{2} = -0.5\n\\]\n**Result:** Negative\n\n**Check:**\n- **Surprising?** Not really. The numerator is negative, and the denominator is positive, resulting in a negative fraction.\n\n---\n\n**Interval 3:** \\((0, \\infty)\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\nPick a test point, say \\(x = 1\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + 3} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\n\\]\n**Result:** Positive\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, both numerator and denominator are positive, so the fraction is positive.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Compiling the Results**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nFrom my sign chart:\n- \\((-\\infty, -3)\\): Positive\n- \\((-3, 0)\\): Negative\n- \\((0, \\infty)\\): Positive\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Where is the expression non-negative?** It\u2019s positive in the intervals \\((-\\infty, -3)\\) and \\((0, \\infty)\\), and zero at \\(x = 0\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does this include all possible cases?** Yes, except for \\(x = -3\\) where the expression is undefined.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Writing the Solution in Interval Notation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBased on the sign chart, the solution where \\(\\frac{x}{x + 3} \\ge 0\\) includes the intervals where the expression is positive and the point where it\u2019s zero, excluding \\(x = -3\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -3) \\cup [0, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does the inequality allow for zero?** Yes, because of the \\(\\ge\\) sign.\n- **Is \\(x = -3\\) included?** No, because the expression is undefined there.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, the solution reflects all values where the expression is non-negative.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s double-check by considering the endpoints and making sure all cases are covered.\n\n**Endpoint Check:**\n- **At \\(x = -3\\):** The expression is undefined, so it cannot be part of the solution.\n- **At \\(x = 0\\):** The expression is zero, which satisfies the inequality.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n- **Could there be any other intervals?** No, because the sign chart covers all possible \\(x\\) values, and the expression is only undefined at \\(x = -3\\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- **Is the solution complete?** Yes, all intervals where the expression is non-negative are included, and \\(x = -3\\) is correctly excluded.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying each step along the way, the solution to the inequality \\(\\frac{x}{x + 3} \\ge 0\\) in interval notation is:\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -3) \\cup [0, \\infty)\n\\]\n\nThis approach ensured that all possible cases were considered, and the solution was refined through critical checks and reflections throughout the process.",
