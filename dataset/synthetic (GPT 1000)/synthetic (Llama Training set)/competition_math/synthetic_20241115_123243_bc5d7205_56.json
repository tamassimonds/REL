    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it for the first time. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect along the way, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's make this as human-like as possible, with all the messy, real-time thoughts that come with solving a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem: **Find the square root of \\( \\dfrac{8!}{70} \\).** \n\nImmediate thoughts:\n\n- **Factorials:** I remember that \\( n! \\) means the product of all positive integers up to \\( n \\). So, \\( 8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times \\ldots \\times 1 \\).\n  \n- **Division by 70:** Dividing \\( 8! \\) by 70 seems straightforward, but I want to make sure the resulting number is manageable before taking the square root.\n  \n- **Square Root:** Taking the square root suggests that perhaps simplifying the expression first might help, especially to see if the denominator cancels out nicely with the numerator.\n\nHonestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Maybe I should compute \\( 8! \\) first and then divide by 70. Or perhaps there's a more efficient way by factoring both numerator and denominator to see if there's cancellation.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Compute \\( 8! \\) Directly:**\n   - Calculate \\( 8! \\) and then divide by 70.\n   \n2. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Factor both \\( 8! \\) and 70 to see if there are common factors that can cancel out before division.\n   \n3. **Use Simplified Fractions:**\n   - Simplify \\( \\dfrac{8!}{70} \\) by reducing the fraction before taking the square root.\n\n4. **Check for Perfect Squares:**\n   - After simplification, see if the numerator becomes a perfect square, making the square root easier to compute.\n\nWait a second... Computing \\( 8! \\) directly gives a large number (it's 40,320). Dividing that by 70 will still leave a pretty big number. Maybe there's a better way by simplifying first.\n\n### **Choosing a Strategy**\n\nLet's try **Prime Factorization** first. I think this might help reduce the fraction before taking the square root, making the calculations more manageable.\n\nBut if that seems too complex, I can always revert to computing \\( 8! \\) directly and proceed from there.\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization of 8! and 70**\n\nLet me start by breaking down \\( 8! \\) and 70 into their prime factors to see if anything cancels out.\n\n- **Prime Factorization of 8!:**\n  \n  \\[\n  8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\n  \\]\n  \n  Breaking it down:\n  - \\( 8 = 2^3 \\)\n  - \\( 7 = 7 \\)\n  - \\( 6 = 2 \\times 3 \\)\n  - \\( 5 = 5 \\)\n  - \\( 4 = 2^2 \\)\n  - \\( 3 = 3 \\)\n  - \\( 2 = 2 \\)\n  - \\( 1 = 1 \\)\n\n  So, combining all:\n  \\[\n  8! = 2^3 \\times 7 \\times (2 \\times 3) \\times 5 \\times 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 2^7 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7\n  \\]\n\n  Wait, let me double-check that:\n  - \\( 2^3 \\times 2 = 2^4 \\)\n  - \\( 2^4 \\times 2^2 = 2^6 \\)\n  - \\( 2^6 \\times 2 = 2^7 \\)\n  - Count factors: 3 twos, 2 threes, 1 five, 1 seven = \\( 2^7 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\)\n\n  Looks good!\n\n- **Prime Factorization of 70:**\n  \n  \\[\n  70 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 7\n  \\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nNow that I have the prime factorizations, I can see if there's any cancellation between the numerator and denominator when I divide \\( 8! \\) by 70.\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying \\( \\dfrac{8!}{70} \\) Using Prime Factors**\n\nSo, let's set up the fraction with the prime factors:\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{8!}{70} = \\dfrac{2^7 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7}{2 \\times 5 \\times 7}\n\\]\n\nNow, cancelling out the common factors:\n\n- **Cancelling 2:** One \\( 2 \\) in the numerator with one \\( 2 \\) in the denominator.\n- **Cancelling 5:** One \\( 5 \\) in the numerator with one \\( 5 \\) in the denominator.\n- **Cancelling 7:** One \\( 7 \\) in the numerator with one \\( 7 \\) in the denominator.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{2^7}{2} \\times \\dfrac{3^2}{1} \\times \\dfrac{5}{5} \\times \\dfrac{7}{7} = 2^{7-1} \\times 3^2 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 2^6 \\times 3^2\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{8!}{70} = 2^6 \\times 3^2\n\\]\n\n### **Check**\n\nWait a moment, let me verify:\n\n- Numerator after cancellation: \n  - \\( 2^7 \\div 2 = 2^6 \\)\n  - \\( 3^2 \\div 1 = 3^2 \\)\n  - \\( 5 \\div 5 = 1 \\)\n  - \\( 7 \\div 7 = 1 \\)\n\n- So, yes, it simplifies to \\( 2^6 \\times 3^2 \\).\n\nThis seems correct because all the excess factors in the numerator have been cancelled out.\n\n### **Step 3: Taking the Square Root**\n\nNow, I need to find the square root of \\( 2^6 \\times 3^2 \\).\n\nI recall that:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^m} = a^{m/2}\n\\]\n\nApplying that here:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^6} = 2^{6/2} = 2^3 = 8\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3^2} = 3^{2/2} = 3^1 = 3\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2^6 \\times 3^2} = \\sqrt{2^6} \\times \\sqrt{3^2} = 8 \\times 3 = 24\n\\]\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nLet me quickly verify:\n\n- **Prime Factor Exponents:**\n  - \\( 2^6 \\) and \\( 3^2 \\) are both perfect squares.\n  \n- **Square Roots:**\n  - \\( 2^6 = 64 \\), and \\( \\sqrt{64} = 8 \\)\n  - \\( 3^2 = 9 \\), and \\( \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\)\n  \n- **Multiplication:**\n  - \\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\)\n\nEverything checks out. The steps logically follow each other, and the arithmetic seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Computing \\( 8! \\) Directly**\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider what would happen if I computed \\( 8! \\) directly and then divided by 70.\n\n- **Compute \\( 8! \\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 40,320\n  \\]\n  \n- **Divide by 70:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\dfrac{40,320}{70} = 576\n  \\]\n  \n- **Take the Square Root:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{576} = 24\n  \\]\n\nThis alternative approach leads to the same final answer: **24**.\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nIt's interesting that both methods\u2014prime factorization and direct computation\u2014yielded the same result. However, the prime factorization method was more efficient as it avoided dealing with large numbers directly. It also provided a clearer path by simplifying the fraction beforehand.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, I was able to streamline the process by using prime factorization to simplify \\( \\dfrac{8!}{70} \\) before taking the square root. Checking each step ensured the correctness of the final answer, which is **24**. Reflecting along the way helped catch potential missteps, confirming the reliability of the chosen approach.",
