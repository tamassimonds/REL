    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work often, and reflect just like I would when solving it manually.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \\(2^{12} = \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^x\\), my initial reaction is, \"This involves exponents and bases, similar to problems I've tackled before.\" It reminds me of solving equations by setting the exponents equal when the bases are the same. But then, I notice the base on the right is a fraction raised to \\(x\\). \n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n\n1. **Express Both Sides with the Same Base:** Maybe I can rewrite \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) as a power of 2, since 8 is a power of 2.\n2. **Logarithms:** Another approach could be to use logarithms to solve for \\(x\\).\n3. **Numerical Evaluation:** Calculate both sides numerically to see if they match, but I prefer algebraic methods for exactness.\n\n**Brainstorming:** Starting with expressing \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) as a power of 2 seems like a straightforward path. If that doesn't work, I can consider using logarithms.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Rewriting \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^x\\) with Base 2**\n\nThinking back to exponent rules, I know that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{b} = b^{-1}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8} = 8^{-1}\n\\]\n\nAnd since \\(8 = 2^3\\), I can write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8} = (2^3)^{-1} = 2^{-3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** That seems correct. By using the property of exponents, I've converted \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) into a base 2 expression.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting Back into the Equation**\n\nNow, substitute \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^x\\) in the original equation:\n\n\\[\n2^{12} = (2^{-3})^x\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** This looks promising because both sides now have the same base (2). According to exponent rules, when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents:\n\n\\[\n(2^{-3})^x = 2^{-3x}\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n2^{12} = 2^{-3x}\n\\]\n\n**Checking:** I need to ensure that both sides are indeed set to equal powers of 2. This matches the structure needed to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting the Exponents Equal**\n\nSince the bases are identical, I can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n\\[\n12 = -3x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This is a standard approach when dealing with exponential equations with the same base. It seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving for \\(x\\)**\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), divide both sides by \\(-3\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{12}{-3} = -4\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:** Wait, does this make sense? If \\(x = -4\\), then \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-4}\\) should equal \\(2^{12}\\). Let me quickly verify that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\nCalculate \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-4}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-4} = 8^4\n\\]\n\nAnd since \\(8 = 2^3\\):\n\n\\[\n8^4 = (2^3)^4 = 2^{12}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** The left side indeed equals the right side when \\(x = -4\\). This confirms that our solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Using Logarithms**\n\nJust to ensure our approach is robust, let's briefly consider using logarithms as an alternative method.\n\n**Applying Logarithms:**\n\nTake the logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\log(2^{12}) = \\log\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^x\\right)\n\\]\n\nUsing logarithm properties:\n\n\\[\n12 \\log(2) = x \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\frac{1}{8} = 2^{-3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = \\log(2^{-3}) = -3 \\log(2)\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n12 \\log(2) = x (-3 \\log(2))\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(-3 \\log(2)\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{12 \\log(2)}{-3 \\log(2)} = -4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This alternative method also leads to \\(x = -4\\), confirming the correctness of our initial approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy starting with rewriting the base and carefully applying exponent rules, we arrived at \\(x = -4\\). Checking our solution through verification and exploring an alternative method using logarithms reinforced the accuracy of our answer.\n\n**Natural Checking:** Throughout the process, I made sure each step logically followed the previous one and reflected if the operations were correct. Verifying the solution ensured that our approach was on the right track.\n\n**Conclusion:** The value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the equation \\(2^{12} = \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^x\\) is **\\(-4\\)**.",
