    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The question asks for the remainder when 2003 is divided by 11. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, it reminds me of basic division, specifically dealing with remainders. It\u2019s similar to finding the modulus in programming or modular arithmetic in math. But honestly, I\u2019m slightly unsure about the best method to tackle this. There are several strategies that come to mind:\n\n1. **Direct Division:** Just divide 2003 by 11 and see what the remainder is.\n2. **Using Modular Arithmetic Properties:** Perhaps leverage some properties of mod to simplify the calculation.\n3. **Estimation with Multiples of 11:** Estimate how many times 11 fits into 2003 to get close and then find the difference.\n4. **Long Division Method:** Perform long division manually to find the remainder.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Direct Division:** This seems straightforward. Divide and find the remainder. But I wonder if there\u2019s a quicker way, especially since 2003 is a larger number.\n  \n- **Modular Arithmetic:** Maybe I can break down 2003 into smaller parts that are easier to handle mod 11.\n\n- **Estimation:** This might give me a quick idea, but I could still end up needing precise calculations afterward.\n\n- **Long Division:** This will definitely give the correct answer, but it\u2019s more time-consuming.\n\nReflecting on these options, I'd prefer starting with **Direct Division** for simplicity. If that feels off, I\u2019ll switch to **Long Division** to confirm. If I notice the calculations getting cumbersome, maybe I'll try breaking it down differently.\n\n**Step 1: Attempting Direct Division**\n\nLet\u2019s try dividing 2003 by 11 directly to see what we get.\n\n- **Calculation:** \n    - \\(2003 \u00f7 11 = 182\\) with a remainder.\n    - To find the exact remainder: \\(2003 - (11 \u00d7 182)\\)\n\nWait a second\u2014let me do that multiplication to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Multiplication:** \n    - \\(11 \u00d7 182 = 2002\\)\n\nHmm, interesting. The remainder is:\n\n- **Remainder Calculation:** \n    - \\(2003 - 2002 = 1\\)\n\nSo, according to this, the remainder is **1**.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes that make sense? Let me think. If 2002 is exactly divisible by 11, and 2003 is just 1 more than 2002, then the remainder should indeed be 1. This seems plausible.\n\n**Step 2: Verifying with Long Division**\n\nJust to ensure everything is correct, let\u2019s perform a long division manually.\n\n- **Long Division Setup:**\n    - Divide 2003 by 11.\n\n- **Steps:**\n    1. **11 goes into 20:** 11 fits into 20 once.\n        - \\(11 \u00d7 1 = 11\\)\n        - Subtract: \\(20 - 11 = 9\\)\n    \n    2. **Bring down the next digit (0):**\n        - Now, divide 90 by 11.\n        - \\(11 \u00d7 8 = 88\\)\n        - Subtract: \\(90 - 88 = 2\\)\n    \n    3. **Bring down the next digit (3):**\n        - Now, divide 23 by 11.\n        - \\(11 \u00d7 2 = 22\\)\n        - Subtract: \\(23 - 22 = 1\\)\n\nSo, after long division, the remainder is also **1**.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nBoth methods\u2014direct division and long division\u2014yield the same remainder: **1**. This consistency gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nBut let me reflect for a moment: \n\n- **Does the remainder make sense?** Yes, since 2002 is exactly divisible by 11, adding 1 to it results in a remainder of 1.\n  \n- **Could there be another approach?** While there are other methods like using modular properties, they might complicate things for this simple problem. \n\n**Step 3: Considering an Alternative Approach**\n\nEven though I\u2019m satisfied with the direct and long division methods, let\u2019s briefly explore another strategy to ensure robustness.\n\n- **Using Modular Arithmetic:**\n  \n    - Recall that modular arithmetic revolves around finding remainders.\n    \n    - We can express 2003 in terms of multiples of 11:\n    \n      \\(2003 = 11 \u00d7 182 + 1\\)\n    \n    - Here, the remainder is clearly **1**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis alternative method confirms the remainder is **1** without additional calculations. It\u2019s a neat way to verify the result, especially for larger numbers where direct division might be less intuitive.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **All methods agree:** Whether using direct division, long division, or modular arithmetic, the remainder consistently is **1**.\n\n- **Sanity check:** A remainder of 1 makes sense given that 2002 is perfectly divisible by 11.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, checking my work along the way, and ensuring consistency across multiple methods, I can confidently say that the remainder when 2003 is divided by 11 is **1**. \n\nThis step-by-step approach, with constant reflection and verification, ensured the accuracy of the solution.",
