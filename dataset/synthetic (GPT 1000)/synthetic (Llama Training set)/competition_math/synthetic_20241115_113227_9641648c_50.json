Here\u2019s how I would approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Brainstorming Thoughts**\n\n**User Query:** A line is drawn through the points \\( (-2, 6) \\) and \\( (-4, -2) \\). What is the \\( y \\)-coordinate of the point where this line intersects the \\( y \\)-axis?\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- Hmm, this question is about finding where a line intersects the \\( y \\)-axis. \n- I remember that the \\( y \\)-axis is where \\( x = 0 \\).\n- So, I need to find the equation of the line that passes through these two points and then determine the \\( y \\)-value when \\( x = 0 \\).\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Slope-Intercept Form:** Find the slope (\\( m \\)) and the \\( y \\)-intercept (\\( b \\)) to write the line equation as \\( y = mx + b \\).\n2. **Point-Slope Form:** Use one of the points and the slope to write the equation of the line.\n3. **Standard Form:** Write the equation in \\( Ax + By = C \\) and find the \\( y \\)-intercept.\n4. **Graphing:** Plot the points and visually identify the \\( y \\)-intercept (though this might not be precise).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- The slope-intercept form seems straightforward because I need the \\( y \\)-intercept directly.\n- But before jumping in, let me recall how to calculate the slope and ensure I remember the formulae correctly.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Slope (\\( m \\))**\n\n**Approach:**\n- The slope \\( m \\) is calculated using the coordinates of the two points:\n  \\[\n  m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n  \\]\n- Here, \\( (x_1, y_1) = (-2, 6) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) = (-4, -2) \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nm = \\frac{-2 - 6}{-4 - (-2)} = \\frac{-8}{-2} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, that slope of 4 means for every unit increase in \\( x \\), \\( y \\) increases by 4 units. That sounds reasonable.\n- But let me double-check the arithmetic:\n  \\[\n  -2 - 6 = -8 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -4 - (-2) = -4 + 2 = -2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\frac{-8}{-2} = 4 \\text{ (correct)}\n  \\]\n- The slope calculation seems correct.\n\n### **Step 2: Use the Slope-Intercept Form to Find \\( b \\)**\n\n**Approach:**\n- The slope-intercept form of a line is \\( y = mx + b \\).\n- We know \\( m = 4 \\), so the equation becomes \\( y = 4x + b \\).\n- To find \\( b \\), we can substitute one of the given points into this equation.\n\n**Using Point \\( (-2, 6) \\):**\n\\[\n6 = 4(-2) + b \n\\]\n\\[\n6 = -8 + b \n\\]\n\\[\nb = 6 + 8 = 14\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So, the equation of the line is \\( y = 4x + 14 \\).\n- Let me verify by plugging in the other point \\( (-4, -2) \\):\n  \\[\n  -2 = 4(-4) + 14 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -2 = -16 + 14 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -2 = -2 \\text{ (correct)}\n  \\]\n- Both points satisfy the line equation, which is a good check.\n\n### **Step 3: Find the \\( y \\)-Intercept**\n\n**Approach:**\n- The \\( y \\)-intercept is where the line intersects the \\( y \\)-axis, meaning \\( x = 0 \\).\n- Substituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the line equation \\( y = 4x + 14 \\):\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\ny = 4(0) + 14 = 14\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The \\( y \\)-coordinate of the intersection point is \\( 14 \\).\n- This makes sense because our \\( b \\) value was \\( 14 \\) in the line equation.\n\n### **Step 4: Quick Check**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Before finalizing, let\u2019s quickly verify if all calculations are consistent.\n\n- Slope Calculation:\n  \\[\n  m = \\frac{-2 - 6}{-4 - (-2)} = \\frac{-8}{-2} = 4 \\text{ (correct)}\n  \\]\n  \n- Line Equation:\n  \\[\n  y = 4x + 14\n  \\]\n  \n- Points Verification:\n  - For \\( (-2, 6) \\):\n    \\[\n    6 = 4(-2) + 14 \\rightarrow 6 = -8 + 14 = 6 \\text{ (correct)}\n    \\]\n    \n  - For \\( (-4, -2) \\):\n    \\[\n    -2 = 4(-4) + 14 \\rightarrow -2 = -16 + 14 = -2 \\text{ (correct)}\n    \\]\n    \n- \\( y \\)-Intercept Calculation:\n  \\[\n  y = 4(0) + 14 = 14 \\text{ (matches \\( b \\) value)}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Everything checks out. The slope, line equation, and \\( y \\)-intercept calculation are consistent.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy:**\n\n**Thinking:**\n- Just to ensure robustness, let's consider using the **point-slope form** of the line equation as another method.\n\n**Point-Slope Form:**\n\\[\ny - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n\\]\n- Using point \\( (-2, 6) \\) and slope \\( m = 4 \\):\n\\[\ny - 6 = 4(x + 2)\n\\]\n\\[\ny - 6 = 4x + 8\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 4x + 14\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This gives the same line equation \\( y = 4x + 14 \\).\n- Therefore, the \\( y \\)-intercept remains \\( 14 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Both methods lead to the same result, confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\n### **Final Check:**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Let\u2019s ensure the \\( y \\)-intercept \\( 14 \\) makes sense geometrically.\n  \n**Thinking:**\n- A \\( y \\)-intercept of \\( 14 \\) means that when \\( x = 0 \\), the line passes through \\( (0, 14) \\).\n- This aligns with our calculations, as the \\( b \\) value in the line equation is \\( 14 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Everything aligns logically and mathematically.\n- The strategies used were effective in confirming the solution.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n- **The \\( y \\)-coordinate of the point where the line intersects the \\( y \\)-axis is \\( 14 \\).**\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- By exploring different strategies and checking our work at each step, we've confirmed that the \\( y \\)-coordinate of the intersection point is indeed \\( 14 \\).\n- This approach ensured accuracy and provided a clear path from understanding the problem to arriving at the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we can find the slope of the line through these two points.  The slope will be equal to: $$\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\\frac{-2-6}{-4-(-2)}=\\frac{-8}{-2}=4$$ Therefore, the line will have the form $y=4x+b$.  To solve for $b$, substitute in one of the given points for $x$ and $y$ as shown: \\begin{align*}\n6&=4(-2)+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6&=-8+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 14&=b\n\\end{align*} Since $b$ in a line of the form $y=mx+b$ is the $y$-intercept, and this is what we are trying to find, the answer is $\\boxed{14}$."
