    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they\u2019re working, check my progress frequently, and be open to changing my approach if needed. Let's begin by thoroughly understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nThe problem states that for some real number \\( r \\), the polynomial \\( 8x^3 - 4x^2 - 42x + 45 \\) is divisible by \\( (x - r)^2 \\). Our goal is to find \\( r \\).\n\nWhen I first see this, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Polynomial Division:** Maybe dividing the polynomial by \\( (x - r)^2 \\) could help me find \\( r \\).\n   \n2. **Remainder Theorem:** I recall that if a polynomial is divisible by \\( (x - r)^2 \\), then both \\( P(r) = 0 \\) and \\( P'(r) = 0 \\). This seems important.\n\n3. **Substituting \\( r \\):** Perhaps substituting \\( r \\) into the polynomial and its derivative could give me two equations to solve for \\( r \\).\n\nI'm leaning towards using the **Remainder Theorem** approach, as it provides two necessary conditions (\\( P(r) = 0 \\) and \\( P'(r) = 0 \\)) that should help pinpoint \\( r \\). But let\u2019s keep an open mind and explore if there\u2019s a better way as we go along.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Applying the Remainder Theorem**\n\nLet\u2019s start by applying the **Remainder Theorem**. According to this theorem, if a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divisible by \\( (x - r)^2 \\), then:\n\n1. \\( P(r) = 0 \\)  \u2014 The polynomial equals zero at \\( x = r \\).\n2. \\( P'(r) = 0 \\) \u2014 The derivative of the polynomial equals zero at \\( x = r \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThis means that \\( r \\) is a double root of the polynomial. So, if I can set up these two equations, solving them should give me the value of \\( r \\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Finding \\( P(r) = 0 \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s set up the equation \\( P(r) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n8r^3 - 4r^2 - 42r + 45 = 0 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis is our first equation. To find \\( r \\), we need another equation, which comes from the derivative condition.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Derivative \\( P'(x) \\)**\n\nNow, let\u2019s find the derivative of the polynomial:\n\n\\[\nP'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(8x^3 - 4x^2 - 42x + 45) = 24x^2 - 8x - 42\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nQuickly verifying the derivative:\n\n- Derivative of \\( 8x^3 \\) is \\( 24x^2 \\).\n- Derivative of \\( -4x^2 \\) is \\( -8x \\).\n- Derivative of \\( -42x \\) is \\( -42 \\).\n- Derivative of the constant \\( 45 \\) is \\( 0 \\).\n\nSo, \\( P'(x) = 24x^2 - 8x - 42 \\) looks correct.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Setting Up the Equation \\( P'(r) = 0 \\)**\n\nNow, set up the second equation using \\( r \\):\n\n\\[\n24r^2 - 8r - 42 = 0 \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWe now have two equations:\n\n1. \\( 8r^3 - 4r^2 - 42r + 45 = 0 \\) (from \\( P(r) = 0 \\))\n2. \\( 24r^2 - 8r - 42 = 0 \\) (from \\( P'(r) = 0 \\))\n\nTo solve for \\( r \\), we can use substitution or elimination. Given that equation (2) is quadratic, we can solve for \\( r \\) directly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Solving the Quadratic Equation (2)**\n\nLet\u2019s solve the quadratic equation \\( 24r^2 - 8r - 42 = 0 \\).\n\nFirst, simplify the equation by dividing all terms by 6:\n\n\\[\n4r^2 - \\frac{4}{3}r - 7 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that seems messy with the fractional coefficient. Let me reconsider. Maybe I should divide by 4 instead to make it neater:\n\n\\[\n24r^2 - 8r - 42 = 0 \\quad \\text{divide by 4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n6r^2 - 2r - 10.5 = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, still not great with the decimal. Let's think about it again.\n\nAh, I see I made an error in my simplification. Let me backtrack.\n\n**Correct Simplification:**\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n\\[\n24r^2 - 8r - 42 = 0\n\\]\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n\\[\n6r^2 - 2r - 10.5 = 0\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, dividing by 4 is correct, but maybe using decimals isn't the best. Let me try keeping it as fractions to avoid rounding errors.\n\n---\n\n**Alternative Approach: Keeping Fractions**\n\nInstead of dealing with decimal coefficients, let's keep it in fractional form. Divide by 2:\n\n\\[\n12r^2 - 4r - 21 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, let's solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a = 12 \\)\n- \\( b = -4 \\)\n- \\( c = -21 \\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(12)(-21)}}{2(12)}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 1008}}{24}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{1024}}{24}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{4 \\pm 32}{24}\n\\]\n\nSo, the possible values for \\( r \\) are:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{36}{24} = \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r = \\frac{-28}{24} = -\\frac{7}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nQuickly checking the calculations:\n\n- \\( \\sqrt{1024} = 32 \\) is correct.\n- The fractions simplify properly.\n\nBoth \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\) and \\( r = -\\frac{7}{6} \\) seem plausible.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, I have two possible values for \\( r \\). But the problem states that the polynomial is divisible by \\( (x - r)^2 \\), which means \\( r \\) must satisfy both \\( P(r) = 0 \\) and \\( P'(r) = 0 \\). Since both conditions lead us to these two values, it might indicate that both could be valid solutions, or perhaps one of them doesn't satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Verifying the Solutions**\n\nTo ensure correctness, let's substitute both \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\) and \\( r = -\\frac{7}{6} \\) back into the original polynomial and its derivative to check if both conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Verification for \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\):**\n\n1. \\( P(r) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nP\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = 8\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^3 - 4\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - 42\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) + 45\n\\]\n\\[\n= 8\\left(\\frac{27}{8}\\right) - 4\\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right) - 63 + 45\n\\]\n\\[\n= 27 - 9 - 63 + 45\n\\]\n\\[\n= 27 - 9 = 18\n\\]\n\\[\n18 - 63 + 45 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( P\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = 0 \\).\n\n2. \\( P'(r) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nP'\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = 24\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - 8\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) - 42\n\\]\n\\[\n= 24 \\times \\frac{9}{4} - 12 - 42\n\\]\n\\[\n= 54 - 12 - 42\n\\]\n\\[\n= 54 - 54 = 0\n\\]\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied for \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\n**Verification for \\( r = -\\frac{7}{6} \\):**\n\n1. \\( P(r) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nP\\left(-\\frac{7}{6}\\right) = 8\\left(-\\frac{7}{6}\\right)^3 - 4\\left(-\\frac{7}{6}\\right)^2 - 42\\left(-\\frac{7}{6}\\right) + 45\n\\]\n\\[\n= 8 \\times \\left(-\\frac{343}{216}\\right) - 4 \\times \\frac{49}{36} + 49 + 45\n\\]\n\\[\n= -\\frac{2744}{216} - \\frac{196}{36} + 49 + 45\n\\]\n\\[\n= -\\frac{2744}{216} - \\frac{984}{216} + 49 + 45\n\\]\n\\[\n= -\\frac{3728}{216} + 94\n\\]\n\\[\n= -\\frac{3728}{216} + \\frac{2024}{216}\n\\]\n\\[\n= -\\frac{1704}{216}\n\\]\n\\[\n= -\\frac{71}{9} \\quad (\\text{Simplified fraction})\n\\]\n\nUh-oh, \\( P\\left(-\\frac{7}{6}\\right) \\neq 0 \\). This indicates that \\( r = -\\frac{7}{6} \\) does not satisfy the polynomial condition.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIt seems that while both \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\) and \\( r = -\\frac{7}{6} \\) emerged as solutions from the quadratic equation, only \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\) satisfies both \\( P(r) = 0 \\) and \\( P'(r) = 0 \\). This suggests that \\( r = -\\frac{7}{6} \\) is not a valid solution for this problem.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Confirming the Final Answer**\n\nGiven that only \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\) satisfies both conditions, we can conclude that:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}\n\\]\n\nThis value of \\( r \\) ensures that the polynomial \\( 8x^3 - 4x^2 - 42x + 45 \\) is divisible by \\( (x - r)^2 \\).\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThroughout this problem, applying the **Remainder Theorem** was crucial in setting up the necessary conditions for \\( r \\). By solving the quadratic equation derived from \\( P'(r) = 0 \\) and verifying the solutions against both conditions, we identified that only \\( r = \\frac{3}{2} \\) is valid. This step-by-step approach, along with consistent checking and reflection, led us to the correct solution.",
