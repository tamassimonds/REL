    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking it through as naturally as possible, just like I would if I were solving it myself. I'll brainstorm, reflect, check my work, and adjust my approach as needed. \n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem defines a new operation \\( A \\& B = \\frac{(A + B)}{2} \\). Then, it asks for the value of \\( (3 \\& 5) \\& 8 \\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like finding the average of two numbers. The \\( \\& \\) operation is just the midpoint between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). That\u2019s straightforward in terms of what averaging means.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Sequential Calculation:** Calculate \\( 3 \\& 5 \\) first, then take that result and calculate \\( \\& 8 \\) with it.\n  2. **Reassess the Operation:** Ensure I fully understand how the \\( \\& \\) operation works before proceeding.\n  3. **Alternative Methods:** Think if there\u2019s a shortcut or a property of averages I could use, but honestly, averaging is pretty direct.\n\n- **Reflection:** Given the definition is simple, Sequential Calculation seems the most straightforward. Let\u2019s start there and see if it leads us correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate \\( 3 \\& 5 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- According to the operation definition: \n  \\[\n  A \\& B = \\frac{(A + B)}{2}\n  \\]\n- So, for \\( 3 \\& 5 \\):\n  \\[\n  3 \\& 5 = \\frac{(3 + 5)}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n3 \\& 5 = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** Adding 3 and 5 gives 8, and half of 8 is 4. That seems right.\n\n- **Reflection:** This makes sense because the average of 3 and 5 is indeed 4. So, moving forward with 4 is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Compute \\( 4 \\& 8 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, we need to find \\( (3 \\& 5) \\& 8 = 4 \\& 8 \\).\n- Applying the operation definition again:\n  \\[\n  4 \\& 8 = \\frac{(4 + 8)}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n4 \\& 8 = \\frac{12}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** Adding 4 and 8 gives 12, half of 12 is 6. This looks correct.\n- **Reflection:** The average of 4 and 8 is indeed 6. This seems logical.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verify the Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The final value we obtained is 6. Let\u2019s double-check if the steps make sense and if there\u2019s any possible mistake.\n\n**Verification:**\n- **Step 1 Recap:** \\( 3 \\& 5 = 4 \\), which is the correct average.\n- **Step 2 Recap:** \\( 4 \\& 8 = 6 \\), also the correct average.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Spot Check:** The operations are straightforward averages, and the calculations are simple divisions. There\u2019s no complexity that might have introduced an error.\n\n- **Reflection:** Everything checks out. The method was straightforward, and the numbers make sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Look for Patterns:** Maybe there's a property of averages we could use.\n  \n- **Consider Commutativity:** The \\( \\& \\) operation is commutative since \\( \\frac{(A + B)}{2} = \\frac{(B + A)}{2} \\). This doesn\u2019t change our approach but is good to note.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does It Help?** Given the problem\u2019s straightforward nature, exploring deeper properties doesn\u2019t simplify it further. Sequential Calculation remains the most efficient method.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Final Answer:** The value of \\( (3 \\& 5) \\& 8 \\) is **6**.\n\n- **Reflection:** By breaking down the problem into manageable steps and verifying each part, we confidently arrive at the correct answer. Thinking through each step ensured there were no miscalculations, and considering alternative methods reinforced the simplicity of the direct approach.\n\n- **Key Takeaway:** When dealing with defined operations like this, applying the definition step by step and checking along the way ensures accuracy and clarity.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's how I'd approach solving the problem\u2014step by step, with constant reflection and verification to ensure the method and the answer are correct.",
