    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm a bit to see where my thoughts lead me, explore different strategies, and make sure to check my work frequently. It\u2019s all about thinking through it naturally, just like I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first look at the question, I see:\n\n- **Function \\( f(x) = |g(x^3)| \\)**\n- **\\( g \\) is an odd function**\n- **Determine if \\( f \\) is odd, even, or neither**\n\nOkay, so \\( f(x) \\) involves the absolute value of \\( g(x^3) \\), and I know that \\( g \\) being odd means \\( g(-x) = -g(x) \\). \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Odd and Even Functions:** I remember that an even function satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\), and an odd function satisfies \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\). So, maybe I need to check \\( f(-x) \\) to see which property it satisfies.\n  \n- **Properties of Absolute Value:** The absolute value function, \\( |x| \\), is even because \\( |x| = |-x| \\). That might play a role here.\n\n- **Involvement of \\( g \\):** Since \\( g \\) is odd, that could affect how \\( f(x) \\) behaves, especially after applying the absolute value.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Compute \\( f(-x) \\) and Compare with \\( f(x) \\):** This seems like the most direct approach. If \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\), then \\( f \\) is even. If \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\), then \\( f \\) is odd. If neither, then it's neither.\n\n2. **Utilize the Property of Absolute Value:** Maybe the evenness of the absolute value function can simplify things.\n\n3. **Consider Specific Examples:** Sometimes, plugging in specific values helps to see the pattern.\n\nHmm, I think starting with **computing \\( f(-x) \\)** is the most straightforward. If that doesn\u2019t work out, I can explore the other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Compute \\( f(-x) \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens when I plug \\(-x\\) into \\( f(x) \\).\n\n\\[\nf(-x) = |g((-x)^3)| \n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nf(-x) = |g(-x^3)|\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute, since \\( g \\) is an odd function, I know that \\( g(-y) = -g(y) \\) for any \\( y \\). So here, \\( y = x^3 \\), so:\n\n\\[\ng(-x^3) = -g(x^3)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this back:\n\n\\[\nf(-x) = |-g(x^3)| \n\\]\n\n**Idea:** The absolute value should take care of the negative sign, so:\n\n\\[\n|-g(x^3)| = |g(x^3)| = f(x)\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion of Step 1:**\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nf(-x) = |g(x^3)| = f(x)\n\\]\n\n**Wait, that looks like an even function!** But let\u2019s pause and think\u2014applying the absolute value might have made it not sensitive to the oddness of \\( g \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Check Definition of Even Function**\n\nTo be sure, remind myself of the definition:\n\nAn even function \\( f \\) satisfies \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nBased on Step 1:\n\n\\[\nf(-x) = f(x)\n\\]\n\nSo, **it satisfies the definition of an even function.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, but the presence of \\( | \\cdot | \\) makes me slightly uncomfortable. Does the absolute value being applied after \\( g \\) affects its parity? Let me think\u2014if \\( g(x) \\) were negative, applying \\( | \\cdot | \\) would make it positive, but since both \\( g(x) \\) and \\( -g(x) \\) map to the same absolute value, I think it's okay.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verify with a Specific Example**\n\nJust to be sure, let's consider a specific example where \\( g(x) \\) is definitely odd.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet\u2019s say \\( g(x) = x \\) (which is odd).\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\nf(x) = |g(x^3)| = |x^3| = |x|^3\n\\]\n\nNow, check \\( f(-x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(-x) = |-x^3| = |x|^3 = f(x)\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn this case, **\\( f(x) \\) is even.** This aligns with our earlier conclusion.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, this specific example supports the idea that \\( f(x) \\) is even. But I want to be sure that it\u2019s not just a coincidence. Let\u2019s consider another example.\n\n**Another Example:**\n\nLet\u2019s take \\( g(x) = -x \\) (which is also odd).\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\nf(x) = |-x^3| = |x|^3\n\\]\n\nNow, check \\( f(-x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(-x) = |(-x)^3| = |x|^3 = f(x)\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAgain, **\\( f(x) \\) is even.** This further solidifies our earlier conclusion.\n\n**Wait, I\u2019m feeling more confident now**, but let\u2019s still consider if there\u2019s a possibility that \\( f(x) \\) could be odd or neither.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Consider the Possibility of \\( f(x) \\) Being Odd or Neither**\n\nAn odd function satisfies \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\).\n\nLet\u2019s see if that\u2019s possible.\n\nFrom Step 1:\n\n\\[\nf(-x) = f(x)\n\\]\n\nSo, for \\( f(x) \\) to be odd, it would need to satisfy:\n\n\\[\nf(-x) = -f(x)\n\\]\n\nBut we have:\n\n\\[\nf(-x) = f(x)\n\\]\n\n**Is there a conflict?**\n\nYes, because \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\) means \\( f(x) \\) is even, not odd. **Therefore, \\( f(x) \\) cannot be odd.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAh, this makes sense. The absolute value ensures that \\( f(x) \\) is even, regardless of the oddness of \\( g(x) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the calculations and reflections:\n\n\\[\nf(-x) = f(x) \\quad \\text{for all } x\n\\]\n\nThis satisfies the definition of an **even function**.\n\n**Therefore, \\( f(x) \\) is **even**.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check:**\n\n- **Does \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\)?** Yes, as shown in Step 1.\n  \n- **Did specific examples support this?** Yes, both \\( g(x) = x \\) and \\( g(x) = -x \\) led to \\( f(x) \\) being even.\n\n- **Is there any inconsistency?** No, applying the absolute value negated the oddness of \\( g \\), making \\( f(x) \\) even.\n\n---\n\nAhh, that feels right. By methodically checking \\( f(-x) \\) and verifying with specific examples, I\u2019m confident that \\( f(x) \\) is indeed **even**.",
