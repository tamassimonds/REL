    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem about finding integers with exactly four positive factors. I'll walk through my thought process step-by-step, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on their correctness, checking my work often, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like how I naturally would when solving a problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I think:\n\n- **\"Hmm, I remember something about numbers having four factors being special. Maybe they relate to prime numbers or certain exponents?\"**\n\n- **\"This reminds me of how square numbers have an odd number of factors because they have a repeated prime factor. But what about numbers with exactly four factors?\"**\n\n- **\"I have no idea where to start... Maybe I should list some small numbers and see their factors to look for a pattern?\"**\n\nI'm leaning toward listing small integers to see which have exactly four positive factors. But I also recall that there's a theoretical way to determine this, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Listing Small Integers:** Check each integer one by one to see which have four factors.\n   \n2. **Mathematical Property:** Use the fact that integers with exactly four factors could be of specific forms (like products of two distinct primes).\n\n3. **Prime Factorization Insight:** Recall that the number of factors is related to the exponents in the prime factorization.\n\nI'll start with the **Listing Small Integers** method to get a concrete feel for the problem and then see if I can find a pattern or a more general rule.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Listing Small Integers**\n\nLet's list the first few positive integers and their factors:\n\n- **1:** Factors are {1} \u2192 1 factor\n- **2:** Factors are {1, 2} \u2192 2 factors\n- **3:** Factors are {1, 3} \u2192 2 factors\n- **4:** Factors are {1, 2, 4} \u2192 3 factors\n- **5:** Factors are {1, 5} \u2192 2 factors\n- **6:** Factors are {1, 2, 3, 6} \u2192 4 factors\n- **7:** Factors are {1, 7} \u2192 2 factors\n- **8:** Factors are {1, 2, 4, 8} \u2192 4 factors\n- **9:** Factors are {1, 3, 9} \u2192 3 factors\n- **10:** Factors are {1, 2, 5, 10} \u2192 4 factors\n- **11:** Factors are {1, 11} \u2192 2 factors\n- **12:** Factors are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12} \u2192 6 factors\n\n#### **Reflection**\n\nFrom this list:\n\n- **6, 8, 10** have exactly four factors.\n\n- **Wait, I only see three numbers here!**\n\n- **Oh, I need five numbers, so I should continue listing beyond 12. Let me add a few more:**\n\n- **14:** Factors are {1, 2, 7, 14} \u2192 4 factors\n- **15:** Factors are {1, 3, 5, 15} \u2192 4 factors\n- **16:** Factors are {1, 2, 4, 8, 16} \u2192 5 factors\n- **18:** Factors are {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18} \u2192 6 factors\n- **20:** Factors are {1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20} \u2192 6 factors\n\nNow I've found five numbers with exactly four factors:\n\n- **6, 8, 10, 14, 15**\n\n#### **Check**\n\n**Does this make sense?** \n- **Let me quickly check each:**\n  - **6:** Factors are {1, 2, 3, 6}\n  - **8:** Factors are {1, 2, 4, 8}\n  - **10:** Factors are {1, 2, 5, 10}\n  - **14:** Factors are {1, 2, 7, 14}\n  - **15:** Factors are {1, 3, 5, 15}\n\n**All have four factors. Looks good!**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying a Pattern**\n\nNow that I've listed the numbers, I notice:\n\n- **All these numbers except 6 are either:**\n  - **Even numbers greater than 2 (8, 10, 14)**\n  - **Odd numbers greater than 3 (15)**\n\n- **6 is the only even number greater than 2 that isn't a multiple of 4.**\n\n#### **Reflection**\n\n**Wait, is there a pattern here?**\n- **Maybe numbers with exactly four factors are those that are products of two distinct primes or primes raised to an odd exponent?**\n\n- **Let me think about prime factorization:**\n\n  - **In general, a number n's total number of factors is (exponent + 1) for each prime factor.**\n  \n  - **So, for a number to have exactly four factors, the exponents could be:**\n    - **(3): Example 2^3 = 8 (has 4 factors: 1, 2, 4, 8)**\n    - **(1,1): Example 2^1 * 3^1 = 6 (has 4 factors: 1, 2, 3, 6)**\n\n#### **Brainstorming**\n\n- **Alright, so numbers that are cubes of primes or products of two distinct primes seem to fit.**\n\n- **But wait, there are also composite numbers with more than two primes (like 15) that have exactly four factors.**\n\n- **Hmm, maybe it's not just limited to cubes or products of two primes. Let me explore further.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring the Mathematical Property**\n\nBased on what I've remembered about factorization:\n\n- **A number has exactly four factors if:**\n  \n  1. **It's the cube of a prime (p^3):**\n     - **Factors are {1, p, p^2, p^3}**\n  \n  2. **It's the product of two distinct primes (p * q):**\n     - **Factors are {1, p, q, p*q}**\n\n#### **Reflection**\n\n**Does this align with the numbers I found?**\n\n- **6:** Product of two distinct primes (2 * 3)\n  \n- **8:** Cube of a prime (2^3)\n  \n- **10:** Product of two distinct primes (2 * 5)\n  \n- **14:** Product of two distinct primes (2 * 7)\n  \n- **15:** Product of two distinct primes (3 * 5)\n\n**Looks like this makes sense!**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Is this approach correct?**\n\n- **Let me think:** \n  - **Have I missed any types of numbers?**\n  - **Are there exceptions?**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **I can't think of any other forms that would give exactly four factors.**\n\n- **So, it seems that the two forms (p^3 and p * q) cover all cases.**\n\n#### **Conclusion**\n\n**It seems that my approach is correct.**\n\n- **Numbers with exactly four factors are either:**\n  - **Cubes of primes**\n  - **Products of two distinct primes**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Listing the Smallest Five Numbers with Four Factors**\n\nBased on the patterns and properties identified:\n\n- **6:** 2 * 3\n- **8:** 2^3\n- **10:** 2 * 5\n- **14:** 2 * 7\n- **15:** 3 * 5\n\n#### **Reflection**\n\n**Wait, earlier I only listed 6, 8, 10, 14, and 15.**\n\n**But now, listing them by their forms, I see I have multiple numbers fitting each category.**\n\n**Let me reorder them by their size to ensure I'm listing the smallest:**\n\n- **6:** 2 * 3\n- **8:** 2^3\n- **10:** 2 * 5\n- **14:** 2 * 7\n- **15:** 3 * 5\n\n#### **Check**\n\n- **Are these the smallest such numbers?**\n  \n- **Let me verify if there's a smaller number I missed.**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n  \n- **I started listing from 1 and only found these five that have exactly four factors.**\n\n- **So, I think I've correctly identified the smallest five.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n**Is my list correct?**\n\n- **I initially found five numbers (6, 8, 10, 14, 15) that each have exactly four positive factors.**\n\n- **Upon reviewing, I see that all these fit the mathematical property I've identified.**\n\n**Does this align with the problem's request?**\n\n- **Yes, the problem asks for the sum of the smallest five such integers, and I've accurately listed them.**\n\n- **I'm confident that my approach is correct, and the numbers listed are indeed the smallest with exactly four factors.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**The sum of the smallest five positive integers that each have exactly four positive factors is:**\n\n\\[\n6 + 8 + 10 + 14 + 15 = 53\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Wait, let me double-check the sum just to be sure:**\n\n\\[\n6 + 8 = 14\n\\]\n\n\\[\n14 + 10 = 24\n\\]\n\n\\[\n24 + 14 = 38\n\\]\n\n\\[\n38 + 15 = 53\n\\]\n\n**Everything adds up correctly.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **By starting with a concrete listing approach, I was able to identify and confirm the specific forms of integers that have exactly four positive factors.**\n\n- **This hands-on method helped me recognize patterns and validate the mathematical property, ensuring that the final list and sum are accurate.**\n\n- **Throughout the process, reflecting and checking each step ensured that any potential mistakes were caught early, leading to a correct and confident final answer.**",
