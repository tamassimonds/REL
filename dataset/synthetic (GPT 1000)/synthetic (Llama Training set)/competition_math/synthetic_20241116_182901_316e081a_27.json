    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, emulating a human-like thought process. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my approach, check my work frequently, and adjust as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it manually.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I notice that one endpoint of a line segment is given, along with its midpoint. We're asked to find the sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving midpoints in coordinate geometry. I think I\u2019ve dealt with something similar before, where knowing one endpoint and the midpoint helps determine the other endpoint.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. Use the midpoint formula to determine the coordinates of the other endpoint.\n  2. Set up equations based on the properties of midpoints.\n  3. Visualize the problem by drawing it out to better understand the relationship between the points.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** At first glance, I'm leaning towards using the midpoint formula since it's a direct application here. But I want to explore and make sure this is the most straightforward path.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n---\n\n**Strategy 1: Midpoint Formula**\n\n- **Thought Process:** The midpoint of a line segment is the average of the coordinates of its endpoints. If I know the midpoint and one endpoint, I can rearrange the formula to solve for the other endpoint.\n\n- **Formula Recall:** \n  \\[\n  M(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n  Where \\(M\\) is the midpoint, and \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the endpoints.\n\n- **Given:**\n  - One endpoint: \\( (4, 3) \\)\n  - Midpoint: \\( (2, 9) \\)\n\n- **Planning:** I\u2019ll plug the known values into the midpoint formula and solve for the unknown coordinates of the other endpoint.\n\n**Strategy 2: Setting Up Equations**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Alternatively, I could set up two equations based on the properties of the midpoint, one for the x-coordinates and one for the y-coordinates.\n\n- **Approach:** Solve these equations simultaneously to find the coordinates of the other endpoint.\n\n**Strategy 3: Visual Representation**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Drawing the points on a coordinate plane might help me visualize the problem better, ensuring that my calculations make sense.\n\n- **Approach:** While this won\u2019t provide numerical answers, it could give insights into the relationship between the points.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Strategy 1: Midpoint Formula**\n\n**Step 1: Apply the Midpoint Formula**\n\n- **Formula Rearranged:** \n  \\[\n  M(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n  Given:\n  - Midpoint \\( M = (2, 9) \\)\n  - Endpoint \\( A = (4, 3) \\)\n  - Other endpoint \\( B = (x, y) \\)\n\n- **Set Up Equations:**\n  \\[\n  2 = \\frac{4 + x}{2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  9 = \\frac{3 + y}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** This seems straightforward. I\u2019m substituting the known values into the formula to solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n**Step 2: Solve for \\( x \\)-Coordinate**\n\n- **Equation:**\n  \\[\n  2 = \\frac{4 + x}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solving:**\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 2 = 4 + x\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  4 = 4 + x\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x = 4 - 4 = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Wait, \\( x \\) being 0 makes sense here because the midpoint averages the coordinates. Let\u2019s move on to the \\( y \\)-coordinate.\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( y \\)-Coordinate**\n\n- **Equation:**\n  \\[\n  9 = \\frac{3 + y}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solving:**\n  \\[\n  9 \\times 2 = 3 + y\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  18 = 3 + y\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = 18 - 3 = 15\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** \\( y = 15 \\) seems reasonable. The midpoint is higher than the given endpoint in the y-direction, so this aligns.\n\n**Reflection:** Both coordinates make sense. The calculations follow logically from the midpoint formula, and the results are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Setting Up Equations**\n\n**Step 1: Set Up Separate Equations for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)**\n\n- **Given:**\n  \\[\n  M_x = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  M_y = \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Substituting Known Values:**\n  \\[\n  2 = \\frac{4 + x}{2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  9 = \\frac{3 + y}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solving for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):**\n  - Multiply both sides by 2:\n    \\[\n    x = 0, \\quad y = 15\n    \\]\n\n**Reflection:** This approach yields the same result. It reassures me that the midpoint formula was correctly applied initially.\n\n**Check:** The solutions \\( (0, 15) \\) align with the midpoint condition. The calculations have been consistent across different strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Visual Representation**\n\n**Step 1: Conceptualizing the Problem**\n\n- **Drawing the Points:**\n  - Endpoint \\( A(4, 3) \\)\n  - Midpoint \\( M(2, 9) \\)\n  - Endpoint \\( B(x, y) = (0, 15) \\)\n\n[Imagine a coordinate plane where these points are plotted.]\n\n- **Understanding the Relationships:**\n  - The midpoint is equidistant from both endpoints.\n  - Given \\( M \\) and \\( A \\), \\( B \\) should balance the coordinates around \\( M \\).\n\n**Reflection:** Visualizing the problem confirms that \\( B(0, 15) \\) correctly satisfies the midpoint condition. It also helps ensure that there are no calculation errors.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Summary**\n\n- **Verification:**\n  - Does the calculated midpoint equal the given midpoint when using \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)?\n  \n    \\[\n    M = \\left(\\frac{4 + 0}{2}, \\frac{3 + 15}{2}\\right) = (2, 9)\n    \\]\n    \n    **Conclusion:** Matches perfectly.\n\n- **Sum of Coordinates of Endpoint \\( B \\):**\n  \\[\n  0 + 15 = 15\n  \\]\n  \n- **Final Answer:** The sum of the coordinates of the other endpoint is **15**.\n\n**Reflection:** Throughout the process, multiple strategies led to consistent results. By checking each step and validating across different approaches, I feel confident that the answer is correct. \n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Exploring Different Strategies:** Initially, I considered using the midpoint formula directly and setting up separate equations. Both methods arrived at the same solution, reinforcing the accuracy.\n\n- **Importance of Reflection:** Regularly checking calculations ensured that no mistakes slipped through. \n\n- **Value of Visual Aids:** Though not numerically necessary, visualizing the points helped confirm the relationship between them, adding an extra layer of verification.\n\n- **Embracing Manual Checks:** Simple checks, like recalculating the midpoint with the found coordinates, validated the correctness of the solution.\n\nThis comprehensive approach, involving brainstorming, strategy exploration, reflection, and verification, ensured a thorough and accurate solution to the problem.",
