    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through different strategies, checking our work frequently, and being open to changing our approach if something doesn't seem right. I'll write my thought process just as a human would, including brainstorming, reflecting, recognizing mistakes, and having those \"aha moments.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, let's see... The problem asks for the coordinates of a point on the line \\(5x - 9y = 42\\) where the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates are additive inverses of each other. An ordered pair is requested.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Additive Inverses:** I remember that additive inverses mean that one number is the negative of the other. So, if \\( (x, y) \\) are the coordinates, we have \\( y = -x \\).\n  \n- **Substituting into the Line Equation:** Maybe I can substitute \\( y = -x \\) into the line equation to find the specific point.\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Another method could be to set up a system of equations, but since there's already a direct relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), that might be overkill.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes that make sense? Yes, substituting \\( y = -x \\) seems like a straightforward way to find the intersection point of the line and the condition \\( y = -x \\). \n\n**Decision:**\n\nI'll go with substituting \\( y = -x \\) into the line equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting \\( y = -x \\) into the Line Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nOkay, if \\( y = -x \\), then I can replace \\( y \\) in the equation \\( 5x - 9y = 42 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n5x - 9(-x) = 42\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n5x + 9x = 42 \\\\\n14x = 42\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{42}{14} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me double-check this. Adding \\( 5x \\) and \\( 9x \\) does indeed give \\( 14x = 42 \\), and dividing by 14 gives \\( x = 3 \\). This seems correct.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nNow that I have \\( x = 3 \\), I need to find \\( y \\) using \\( y = -x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding \\( y \\) Using \\( y = -x \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince \\( y = -x \\), and we've found \\( x = 3 \\), I can easily find \\( y \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\ny = -3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense because \\( y \\) needs to be the additive inverse of \\( x \\). So, \\( y = -3 \\) is correct.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nOur point is \\( (3, -3) \\). Let's check if this point lies on the line \\( 5x - 9y = 42 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Point \\( (3, -3) \\) on the Line**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIt's essential to confirm that the point \\( (3, -3) \\) satisfies the original line equation. This ensures our solution is correct.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( y = -3 \\) into \\( 5x - 9y = 42 \\):\n\n\\[\n5(3) - 9(-3) = 15 + 27 = 42\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe left side equals 42, which matches the right side of the equation. Therefore, the point \\( (3, -3) \\) lies on the line.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOur solution is confirmed. The coordinates of the point are \\( (3, -3) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Reflecting on the Approach and Checking for Errors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's take a moment to reflect on the entire process. Did each step logically lead to the next? Is there any part that seems off?\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Additive Inverses:** We established that \\( y = -x \\), which aligns with the problem's requirement.\n  \n- **Substitution:** Replacing \\( y \\) in the line equation was straightforward and led to a clean solution for \\( x \\).\n  \n- **Verification:** Checking the point against the original line equation confirmed its validity.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n\nIs there another method I could have used? Maybe plotting the line and seeing where it intersects \\( y = -x \\) visually could serve as a verification step, but since algebraically everything checks out, it's unlikely there's an error.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince both algebraic substitution and verification confirm the point \\( (3, -3) \\), we're confident in the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Considering an Alternative Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAlthough our current approach worked, it's always good to consider other methods in case there's a more efficient way.\n\n**Alternative Method:**\n\n- **Graphical Approach:** Plotting the line \\( 5x - 9y = 42 \\) and the line \\( y = -x \\) to find their intersection.\n  \n- **System of Equations:** Setting \\( y = -x \\) and substituting into the line equation was already executed, but using matrices or substitution in a different order could be considered.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven that substitution provided a straightforward path to the solution and verification confirmed its correctness, I'm satisfied with the current method. Alternative strategies might be more suitable for different types of problems but aren't necessary here.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Solution Correctness:** The point \\( (3, -3) \\) satisfies both the condition of additive inverses and the line equation.\n  \n- **Approach Validity:** Substituting \\( y = -x \\) into the line equation was an effective strategy, and verifying the solution ensured its accuracy.\n\n- **Learning Moment:** Thinking through different strategies and verifying solutions is crucial in problem-solving to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe coordinates of the point are \\( \\boxed{(3, -3)} \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Our point lies on $5x-9y=42$ with the condition that $x=-y$. Thus, we have the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n5x-9y &= 42\\\\\nx &= -y.\n\\end{align*} Substituting $x= -y$ into the first equation gives  \\begin{align*}\n5(-y) -9y &=42\\\\\n\\Rightarrow -14y &= 42\\\\\n\\Rightarrow y &=-3.\n\\end{align*} Thus $x = -y = -(-3) = 3$, so our desired point is $\\boxed{(3,-3)}$."
