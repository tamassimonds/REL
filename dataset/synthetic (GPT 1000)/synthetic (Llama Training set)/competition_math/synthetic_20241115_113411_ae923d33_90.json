    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: \n\n**If \\(3^{x+8} = 9^{x+3}\\), what is \\(x\\)?**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst thoughts: \n\n- **Recognizing Bases:** I see the bases 3 and 9. Wait, 9 is \\(3^2\\), right? Maybe I can rewrite the equation using the same base.\n  \n- **Objective:** I need to find the value of \\(x\\) that makes the equation true.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**  \n  - Rewrite both sides with the same base.\n  - Use logarithms to solve for \\(x\\).\n  - Attempt exponent rules to simplify.\n\nLet me brainstorm which method might be quickest. **Rewriting with the same base** seems promising since both 3 and 9 are powers of 3.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Rewriting the Equation with the Same Base**\n\nThought process: \n\n- **Given:** \\(3^{x+8} = 9^{x+3}\\)\n  \n- **Recalling:** \\(9 = 3^2\\), so I can rewrite 9 in terms of base 3.\n\n- **Rewrite \\(9^{x+3}\\):**  \n  \\[\n  9^{x+3} = (3^2)^{x+3} = 3^{2(x+3)} = 3^{2x + 6}\n  \\]\n\n- **Now the Equation is:**  \n  \\[\n  3^{x+8} = 3^{2x + 6}\n  \\]\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, both sides are powers of 3, so I can set the exponents equal to each other.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Exponents Equal to Each Other**\n\nThought process: \n\n- **Since the bases are equal:**  \n  \\[\n  x + 8 = 2x + 6\n  \\]\n\n- **This should be straightforward to solve for \\(x\\).**\n\n**Checking:** Seems correct because if \\(3^a = 3^b\\), then \\(a = b\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the Equation for \\(x\\)**\n\nThought process: \n\n- **Rearrange the equation:**  \n  \\[\n  x + 8 = 2x + 6\n  \\]\n  \n- **Subtract \\(x\\) from both sides:**  \n  \\[\n  8 = x + 6\n  \\]\n  \n- **Subtract 6 from both sides:**  \n  \\[\n  x = 2\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, let me double-check this quickly. If \\(x = 2\\), then:\n\n- **Left Side:**  \n  \\[\n  3^{2+8} = 3^{10}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Right Side:**  \n  \\[\n  9^{2+3} = 9^5 = (3^2)^5 = 3^{10}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Both sides are equal:**  \n  \\[\n  3^{10} = 3^{10}\n  \\]\n  \n**Conclusion:** Yes, \\(x = 2\\) works. The check confirms the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Alternative Strategies and Reflection**\n\nThought process:\n\n- **Reconsidering:** Although the method worked well, let's brainstorm other approaches to ensure there's no oversight.\n  \n- **Alternative Method:** Use logarithms to solve the original equation.\n\n  - **Applying Logarithms:**  \n    \\[\n    \\log(3^{x+8}) = \\log(9^{x+3})\n    \\]\n    \n  - **Using Logarithm Power Rule:**  \n    \\[\n    (x + 8) \\log(3) = (x + 3) \\log(9)\n    \\]\n    \n  - **Knowing \\(9 = 3^2\\), thus \\(\\log(9) = 2 \\log(3)\\):**  \n    \\[\n    (x + 8) \\log(3) = (x + 3) \\times 2 \\log(3)\n    \\]\n    \n  - **Simplifying:**  \n    \\[\n    (x + 8) = 2(x + 3)\n    \\]\n    \n  - **Solving for \\(x\\):**  \n    \\[\n    x + 8 = 2x + 6 \\implies x = 2\n    \\]\n    \n- **Comparison with the First Method:** Both approaches yield the same solution, \\(x = 2\\).\n\n**Check:** Does the alternative method confirm the correctness? Yes, both strategies lead to the same answer, reinforcing its validity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Starting by recognizing that 9 is a power of 3 guided the choice of strategy.\n\n- **Reflection and Checking:** Throughout the process, checking each step ensured the correctness of the solution.\n\n- **Alternative Approaches:** Exploring logarithms provided an additional verification, confirming that \\(x = 2\\) is indeed the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\nx = 2\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "We write $9$ as a power of $3$, and we have $9^{x+3}=(3^2)^{x+3}=3^{2(x+3)} = 3^{2x+6}$.  Therefore, the original equation is $3^{x+8} = 3^{2x+6}$. Equating the two exponents, we get $x+8=2x+6$. Solving, we get that $x=\\boxed{2}$."
