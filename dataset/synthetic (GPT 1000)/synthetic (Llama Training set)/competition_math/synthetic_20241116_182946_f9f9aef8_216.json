I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it myself, exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**Rewrite the expression \\(6j^2 - 4j + 12\\) in the form \\(c(j + p)^2 + q\\), where \\(c\\), \\(p\\), and \\(q\\) are constants. What is \\(\\frac{q}{p}\\)?**\n\nI think, \"This looks like a completing the square problem.\" But then I remember that completing the square is one method among others. Maybe factoring or using the quadratic formula could help too, but those don't immediately fit the form \\(c(j + p)^2 + q\\). \n\nSo, **brainstorming**, I lean towards **completing the square** as the primary strategy. However, I also consider rearranging the expression differently or checking if it can be factored neatly. \n\n**Reflection**: Is completing the square the best approach? I recall that completing the square directly leads to the vertex form of a quadratic, which matches our target form. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Complete the Square**\n\n**Thought Process**: \nLet's try completing the square. The general form of completing the square for \\(aj^2 + bj + c\\) is:\n\n\\[\naj^2 + bj + c = a\\left(j^2 + \\frac{b}{a}j\\right) + c\n\\]\n\nThen, add and subtract \\(\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2\\) inside the parentheses to complete the square.\n\n**Calculations**:\n\n1. **Identify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\)**:\n   \\[\n   a = 6,\\quad b = -4,\\quad c = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compute \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-4}{6} = -\\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find \\(\\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(-\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Add and subtract \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\) inside the square**:\n   \\[\n   6\\left(j^2 - \\frac{2}{3}j + \\frac{1}{9} - \\frac{1}{9}\\right) + 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 6\\left(\\left(j - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{9}\\right) + 12\n   \\]\n\n5. **Distribute the 6**:\n   \\[\n   6\\left(j - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 - 6 \\times \\frac{1}{9} + 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 6\\left(j - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 - \\frac{2}{3} + 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 6\\left(j - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + \\frac{34}{3}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection**:\nWait, so now our expression is:\n\\[\n6\\left(j - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + \\frac{34}{3}\n\\]\nThis seems to fit the \\(c(j + p)^2 + q\\) form, but let me double-check the signs and constants.\n\n**Quick Check**:\nDoes \\(\\frac{34}{3}\\) make sense? Converting \\(12\\) to thirds:\n\\[\n12 = \\frac{36}{3}\n\\]\nSo:\n\\[\n-\\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{36}{3} = \\frac{34}{3}\n\\]\nOkay, that checks out.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying \\(c\\), \\(p\\), and \\(q\\)**\n\n**Thought Process**:\nNow, comparing our expression \\(6(j - \\frac{1}{3})^2 + \\frac{34}{3}\\) with \\(c(j + p)^2 + q\\), I need to identify the constants.\n\n**Calculations**:\n\\[\nc = 6,\\quad p = -\\frac{1}{3},\\quad q = \\frac{34}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**:\nDoes this match the required form? Yes, but in the standard form, \\(p\\) should be added, so I think I need to rewrite \\(j - \\frac{1}{3}\\) as \\(j + (-\\frac{1}{3})\\). That makes it fit better with \\(j + p\\).\n\n**Clarification**:\nSo, technically:\n\\[\nj - \\frac{1}{3} = j + (-\\frac{1}{3})\n\\]\nwhich aligns with \\(j + p\\), where \\(p = -\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\(\\frac{q}{p}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process**:\nNow, the problem asks for \\(\\frac{q}{p}\\). Let\u2019s plug in the values we found.\n\n**Calculations**:\n\\[\n\\frac{q}{p} = \\frac{\\frac{34}{3}}{-\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{34}{3} \\times -\\frac{3}{1} = -34\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**:\nDoes \\(\\frac{q}{p} = -34\\) seem reasonable? Let me think. Since both \\(q\\) and \\(p\\) are negative when divided, it makes sense. Also, the magnitude aligns with the constants we worked out.\n\n**Check**:\nBefore finalizing, let\u2019s see if substituting back into the original expression holds true.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process**:\nTo ensure correctness, I'll substitute the completed square back to see if it matches the original expression.\n\n**Calculations**:\nStart with:\n\\[\n6(j - \\frac{1}{3})^2 + \\frac{34}{3}\n\\]\n\nExpand \\((j - \\frac{1}{3})^2\\):\n\\[\n(j - \\frac{1}{3})^2 = j^2 - 2 \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times j + \\frac{1}{9} = j^2 - \\frac{2}{3}j + \\frac{1}{9}\n\\]\n\nMultiply by 6:\n\\[\n6(j^2 - \\frac{2}{3}j + \\frac{1}{9}) = 6j^2 - 4j + \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nAdd \\(\\frac{34}{3}\\):\n\\[\n6j^2 - 4j + \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{34}{3} = 6j^2 - 4j + \\frac{36}{3} = 6j^2 - 4j + 12\n\\]\n\n**Result**:\nIt matches the original expression! So, our completed square form is indeed correct.\n\n**Reflection**:\nThis confirms that our approach was correct. The value \\(\\frac{q}{p} = -34\\) is accurate.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThroughout this problem, I started by brainstorming that completing the square was likely the best strategy. After attempting it, I carefully tracked my calculations to ensure accuracy. By verifying at each step, I caught any potential misalignment early on. Finally, checking that the expanded form matched the original expression solidified the correctness of the solution.\n\nThe key takeaway is to **stay flexible** with strategies, **reflect often**, and **verify** each step to ensure the path taken leads to the correct solution.",
