I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on what's working and what's not, and make adjustments along the way. Let's get started!\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:  \n**Find the absolute value of the difference of the solutions of \\(x^2 - 5x + 5 = 0\\).**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a quadratic equation. I remember from algebra that we can find the solutions (roots) using the quadratic formula. But then again, I also recall that there might be other methods like factoring or completing the square.  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Quadratic Formula:** This is the standard method for finding roots of quadratic equations.\n  2. **Factoring:** If the equation is easily factorable, this could be faster.\n  3. **Completing the Square:** Another method I learned, but it might be more work here.\n  4. **Graphing:** Not exact, but could give a visual clue about the roots.\n\n- **Brainstorming:**  \n  - **Quadratic Formula** seems reliable, especially since the equation coefficients are straightforward.\n  - **Factoring** could be an option, but I\u2019m not sure if \\(x^2 - 5x + 5\\) factors nicely.\n  - **Completing the Square** could work, but it might take longer than just using the quadratic formula.\n  - **Graphing** would be more of a last resort to check if the roots are correct.\n\n- **Thoughts:** I think starting with the **Quadratic Formula** is a good approach. If that doesn't seem right, I can try factoring or completing the square. Let's go ahead with the quadratic formula to see where it leads.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Quadratic Formula**\n\nThe **Quadratic Formula** is given by:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\n- **Identifying Coefficients:**\n  - From \\(x^2 - 5x + 5 = 0\\),  \n    - \\(a = 1\\)  \n    - \\(b = -5\\)  \n    - \\(c = 5\\)  \n\n- **Calculating \\(b^2 - 4ac\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 25 - 20 = 5\n  \\]\n\n- **Thoughts:**  \n  - The **discriminant** (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\)) is positive (\\(5\\)), which means there are two distinct real solutions.\n  - This makes sense because the graph of the quadratic would intersect the x-axis at two points.\n\n- **Plugging Values into the Formula:**\n  \n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculating the Two Solutions:**\n  \n  \\[\n  x_1 = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}  \n  x_2 = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  - **Does this make sense?** Yes, both solutions involve \\(\\sqrt{5}\\), which is a real number. The quadratic formula seems to have worked correctly here.\n  - **Quick Check:** The discriminant was positive, so having two real solutions aligns with the expectations.\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Absolute Value of the Difference of the Solutions**\n\nNow, the problem asks for the **absolute value of the difference** of the solutions. Let's compute that.\n\n- **Difference of the Solutions:**\n  \n  \\[\n  x_1 - x_2 = \\left(\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{5 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplifying the Expression:**\n  \n  \\[\n  x_1 - x_2 = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{5} - 5 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}  \n  = \\frac{2\\sqrt{5}}{2}  \n  = \\sqrt{5}\n  \\]\n\n- **Absolute Value:**\n  \n  \\[\n  |x_1 - x_2| = |\\sqrt{5}| = \\sqrt{5}\n  \\]\n\n- **Thoughts:**  \n  - The difference simplifies nicely to \\(\\sqrt{5}\\).\n  - Taking the absolute value is straightforward since \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) is already positive.\n  - **Does this feel right?** Yes, calculating the difference directly from the solutions made it easy to see the absolute value.\n\n### **Step 3: Verification**\n\nIt's always good to check if the work is correct. Let's verify our steps.\n\n- **Check the Quadratic Formula Application:**\n  - Recalculate the discriminant:\n    \n    \\[\n    b^2 - 4ac = 5\n    \\]\n    \n    - **Reflection:** Correct, a positive discriminant indicates two real solutions.\n\n  - Recompute \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\):\n    \n    \\[\n    x_1 = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}  \n    x_2 = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n    \\]\n    \n    - **Quick Check:** These look correct; both involve \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) as expected.\n\n- **Check the Difference and Absolute Value:**\n  - Difference:\n    \n    \\[\n    x_1 - x_2 = \\sqrt{5}\n    \\]\n    \n    - **Reflection:** Seems right; the terms involving 5 cancel out, leaving only \\(\\sqrt{5}\\).\n  \n  - Absolute Value:\n    \n    \\[\n    |\\sqrt{5}| = \\sqrt{5}\n    \\]\n    \n    - **Does this make sense?** Yes, \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) is positive, so the absolute value is itself.\n\n- **Final Thoughts:**  \n  - Everything checks out. The quadratic formula was applied correctly, the solutions were computed accurately, and the absolute value of their difference is indeed \\(\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Factoring**\n\nJust to explore another strategy, let's see if the quadratic equation can be factored.\n\n- **Original Equation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  x^2 - 5x + 5 = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **Looking for Factors:**\n  - We're trying to write it as:\n    \n    \\[\n    (x - p)(x - q) = 0\n    \\]\n    \n    - Where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are the roots.\n\n- **Expanding the Factored Form:**\n  \n  \\[\n  x^2 - (p + q)x + pq = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  - **Comparing Coefficients:**\n    - \\(p + q = 5\\)\n    - \\(pq = 5\\)\n\n- **Thoughts:**  \n  - I need two numbers that add up to 5 and multiply to 5.\n  - **Quick Brainstorm:**\n    - Possible pairs:  \n      - \\(p = 5\\), \\(q = 1\\) \u2192 \\(5 \\times 1 = 5\\) \n      - But \\(5 + 1 = 6\\), not 5.\n      - Maybe negative numbers could work:  \n        - \\(p = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\), \\(q = \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\) \u2192 These are actually the solutions we found using the quadratic formula.\n\n- **Realization:**  \n  - **Wait a minute:** The solutions from the quadratic formula match the roots we'd need for factoring. This suggests that factoring might not be the most straightforward approach here, especially since it leads back to the quadratic formula solutions.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  - Factoring confirms the quadratic formula results but doesn't necessarily provide an easier path for this problem.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully applying the quadratic formula, verifying each step, and considering alternative methods, the absolute value of the difference of the solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\n### **Recap**\n\n- **Started with:** Exploring different strategies, decided on using the quadratic formula.\n- **Step-by-Step Process:** \n  - Applied the quadratic formula to find the solutions.\n  - Calculated the absolute value of their difference.\n  - Verified the calculations for accuracy.\n- **Alternative Approach:** Tried factoring to confirm the roots, which aligned with the quadratic formula results.\n- **Final Reflection:** The quadratic formula provided a straightforward solution, and all checks aligned with the expected outcome.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the roots of this polynomial be $r_1$ and $r_2$. Since the sum of the roots of a polynomial $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is $-\\frac{b}{a}$ and the product of the roots is $\\frac{c}{a}$, $r_1+r_2=5$ and $r_1r_2=5$. Squaring the first equation results in $r_1^2+2r_1r_2+r_2^2=25$.\n\nNotice that $(r_1-r_2)^2=r_1^2-2r_1r_2+r_2^2$, so the difference of the roots can be obtained by subtracting 4 copies of the product of the roots from the square of their sum: $r_1^2-2r_1r_2+r_2^2=r_1^2+2r_1r_2+r_2^2-4r_1r_2=25-4(5)=5$. Therefore, $|r_1-r_2|=\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}$.\n\nWe also could have used the quadratic formula to determine that the roots are $\\dfrac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$, and the positive difference of these roots is indeed $\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}$."
