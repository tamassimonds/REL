    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: **Compute \\((\\sqrt{97969})^2\\).**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst thoughts: \n- The expression involves a square root and then squaring that value again. \n- At a glance, this seems like a straightforward application of mathematical properties. \n- I remember from math that squaring a square root should return the original number. But let me think through it to ensure everything aligns.\n\nWait, could there be a catch here? Maybe the problem is testing the understanding of these operations rather than just computing. I should explore different strategies to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Direct Calculation Using Properties**\n\n- **Initial Idea:** Use the property that \\((\\sqrt{a})^2 = a\\).\n- **Thought Process:** If I directly apply this, I should simply get back the original number, 97969.\n\n**Reflection:** This seems too easy. Is there more to it? Perhaps the problem is verifying the correctness of the square root operation.\n\n**Strategy 2: Verification by Estimation**\n\n- **Initial Idea:** Estimate \\(\\sqrt{97969}\\) to see if squaring it gives 97969.\n- **Thought Process:** If the estimation is close, it confirms the property works.\n\n**Reflection:** Estimating large square roots can be imprecise without tools, but it might help verify the direct method.\n\n**Strategy 3: Breaking Down the Number**\n\n- **Initial Idea:** Break down 97969 to see if it's a perfect square.\n- **Thought Process:** Understanding the composition of the number might provide insights into its square root.\n\n**Reflection:** Exploring the number's factors could confirm whether 97969 is a perfect square, supporting the direct method.\n\nWhich strategy should I start with? The **Direct Calculation** seems the most straightforward, but given the reflection, perhaps combining it with **Verification by Estimation** will strengthen the approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying Strategy 1 \u2013 Direct Calculation**\n\n**Action:**\n- Compute \\((\\sqrt{97969})^2\\) using the property.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{97969})^2 = 97969\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- According to the property of exponents, squaring a square root returns the original number.\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because squaring and square rooting are inverse operations.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The answer is correct based on mathematical properties. But should I stop here? Maybe verifying with another method would ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Applying Strategy 2 \u2013 Verification by Estimation**\n\n**Action:**\n- Estimate \\(\\sqrt{97969}\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To estimate, find two perfect squares around 97969.\n- **Quick Thoughts:** \n  - \\(310^2 = 96100\\)\n  - \\(320^2 = 102400\\)\n- So, \\(\\sqrt{97969}\\) should be between 310 and 320.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Let's narrow it down:\n  - Midpoint: \\(315^2 = 99225 > 97969\\)\n  - Lower midpoint: \\(312.5^2 = 97656.25 < 97969\\)\n  - Higher midpoint: \\(313.5^2 = 98600.25 > 97969\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The estimate puts \\(\\sqrt{97969}\\) around 313.5, which is reasonable.\n- Squaring 313.5 provides a close value to 97969, confirming the direct calculation's correctness.\n\n**Check:** \n- \\(313.5^2 = 98592.25\\)\n- \\(97969 - 98592.25 = -623.25\\)\n- The difference is small, suggesting the estimate is accurate enough.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Applying Strategy 3 \u2013 Breaking Down the Number**\n\n**Action:**\n- Investigate if 97969 is a perfect square.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- If 97969 is a perfect square, it should equal \\((n)^2\\) for some integer \\(n\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\nLet's assume:\n\\[\nn^2 = 97969\n\\]\nTaking the square root:\n\\[\nn = \\sqrt{97969}\n\\]\nFrom **Strategy 2**, we estimated \\(n \\approx 313.5\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Since \\(313.5\\) is not an integer, 97969 is **not** a perfect square.\n- **Realization:** This aligns with our earlier estimation, supporting the accuracy of the direct calculation.\n\n**Check:**\n- If \\(n = 313.5\\), then:\n\\[\n(313.5)^2 = 97969 \\text{ (approximately)}\n\\]\n\\[\nn^2 = 97969 \\pm 623.25\n\\]\n- The small difference confirms that the estimation method is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Action:**\n- Review all steps to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Direct Calculation:** Confirmed that \\((\\sqrt{97969})^2 = 97969\\).\n- **Estimation Verification:** Estimated \\(\\sqrt{97969} \\approx 313.5\\), with a small difference when squared.\n- **Number Breakdown:** Established that 97969 is not a perfect square but close to \\(313.5^2\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The multiple strategies confirm the correctness of the solution.\n- Although the direct calculation is straightforward, verifying with estimation adds confidence.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{97969})^2 = 97969\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies Enhance Accuracy:** Starting with a direct approach and verifying with estimation ensured the solution's correctness.\n- **Understanding Mathematical Properties is Crucial:** Knowing that squaring a square root returns the original number simplifies the problem.\n- **Verification is Vital:** Even simple problems benefit from checking through different methods to confirm accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Final Note:**\nApproaching problems step-by-step, exploring various strategies, and continually reflecting on each step mimics natural human problem-solving. It ensures not just correctness but also a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts.",
