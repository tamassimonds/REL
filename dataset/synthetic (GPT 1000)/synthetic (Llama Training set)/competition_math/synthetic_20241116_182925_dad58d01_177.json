The equation given is:\n\n\\[ 2^x + 2^x + 2^x + 2^x = 128 \\]\n\nAnd we need to find the value of \\( (x + 1)(x - 1) \\).\n\n**First Impressions:**\n\n- **Repetition of \\(2^x\\):** I notice that \\(2^x\\) is added together four times on the left side. This makes me think about factoring or simplifying the expression.\n- **Power of Two:** The right side, 128, is a power of two (\\(2^7\\)). This suggests that maybe manipulating the left side to match a power of two could be useful.\n- **Exponents and Logs:** Since we're dealing with exponents, logarithms might come into play to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Factorization Approach:** Since \\(2^x\\) is repeated, maybe I can factor it out to simplify the equation.\n2. **Exponential Equations:** Use properties of exponents to solve for \\(x\\) directly.\n3. **Logarithmic Method:** Apply logarithms to both sides to find \\(x\\).\n4. **Check by Substitution:** After finding \\(x\\), plug it back into the original equation to verify correctness.\n\nLet me start with the **Factorization Approach** because it seems straightforward. If that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll try the exponential properties.\n\n### Step 1: Attempting Factorization\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since all terms on the left are \\(2^x\\), I can combine them by factoring.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n2^x + 2^x + 2^x + 2^x = 4 \\times 2^x\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 2^x = 128\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, I know that 4 can be expressed as a power of 2:\n\n\\[\n4 = 2^2\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 2^x = 2^2 \\times 2^x = 2^{x+2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n2^{x+2} = 128\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Let\u2019s see. If \\(2^{x+2} = 128\\) and \\(128 = 2^7\\), then:\n\n\\[\nx + 2 = 7 \\implies x = 5\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n- If \\(x = 5\\), then \\(2^x = 2^5 = 32\\).\n- On the left side: \\(32 + 32 + 32 + 32 = 128\\), which matches the right side.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 1:**\n\nThis approach seems to work. But just to be thorough, I'll check using a different method to ensure it's correct.\n\n### Step 2: Verifying with Exponential Properties\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let's use the property that if \\(a^m = a^n\\), then \\(m = n\\) (since \\(a \\neq 0\\)).\n- This time, I'll set the exponents equal after simplifying.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFrom Step 1, we had:\n\n\\[\n2^{x+2} = 128\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(128 = 2^7\\), we can equate exponents:\n\n\\[\nx + 2 = 7\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = 7 - 2 = 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, both methods lead to \\(x = 5\\). That's a good sign.\n\n### Step 3: Final Check with Logarithms\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To ensure no steps were skipped, let's apply logarithms to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nStarting with the simplified equation from Step 1:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 2^x = 128\n\\]\n\nTaking logarithm base 2 of both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2(4 \\times 2^x) = \\log_2(128)\n\\]\n\nUsing logarithmic properties:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2(4) + \\log_2(2^x) = \\log_2(128)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2 + x = 7\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = 7 - 2 = 5\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this align with our earlier findings? Yes, \\(x = 5\\).\n\n### Step 4: Computing \\( (x + 1)(x - 1) \\)\n\nNow that we've confirmed \\(x = 5\\), let's find \\( (x + 1)(x - 1) \\):\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 - 1\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 5\\):\n\n\\[\n5^2 - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me double-check. Is there any other exponent or property at play here that might affect the result? No, everything checks out. The calculation is straightforward.\n\n### Final Check\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Verify if all steps logically connect and if the final answer makes sense within the context of the problem.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- All methods point to \\(x = 5\\).\n- The computation for \\( (x + 1)(x - 1) \\) leads to 24 without any inconsistencies.\n- Substituting \\(x = 5\\) back into the original equation satisfies the condition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe value of \\( (x + 1)(x - 1) \\) is \\(\\boxed{24}\\).\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Started by factoring** the repeated \\(2^x\\) to simplify the equation.\n- **Verified the solution** using different methods (exponential properties and logarithms) to ensure accuracy.\n- **Computed the final answer** by substituting \\(x = 5\\) into \\( (x + 1)(x - 1) \\).\n- **Checked all steps** along the way to confirm correctness.\n\nThroughout the process, I brainstormed various strategies, reflected on each step's validity, and ensured that the approaches consistently led to the same solution. This thorough checking ensured that the final answer is accurate.",
