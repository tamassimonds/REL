    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, a few things stand out:\n\n1. **Ed's Test Scores:** He has five tests, and we know the scores of the first three (87, 85, and 87).\n2. **Average Score:** He needs to maintain a 90% average across all five tests.\n3. **Difference Between Last Two Tests:** The scores of the last two tests differ by three points.\n4. **Objective:** Determine the highest test score among the five.\n\nInitially, I'm thinking about how averages work and maybe setting up some equations. The fact that the last two scores differ by three points adds a layer of complexity, so I might need to use variables for those.\n\nBut I'm unsure if just setting up equations will be enough. Maybe I should start with finding the total score needed for a 90% average and then see how the other scores fit in. Let me think this through.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate the Required Total Score:** Since the average is 90% of 100 points, the total score for all five tests should be 450.\n   \n2. **Determine the Sum of the First Three Tests:** Add up the known scores: 87 + 85 + 87 = 259.\n\n3. **Find the Combined Score of the Last Two Tests:** Subtract the sum of the first three tests from the required total:\n   \\[\n   450 - 259 = 191\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Set Up a Relationship Between the Last Two Scores:** The scores differ by three points. Let\u2019s denote the higher score as \\( x \\) and the lower score as \\( x - 3 \\).\n\n5. **Create an Equation:** Set up an equation based on the sum of the last two scores:\n   \\[\n   x + (x - 3) = 191\n   \\]\n   \n6. **Solve for \\( x \\):** This will give us the higher score among the last two tests.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Initial Approach**\n\nWait a second\u2014does this make sense? If I solve for \\( x \\) using this equation, I should get the higher score for the last two tests. Let's proceed and see if it aligns with the given average.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Required Total Score for 90% Average**\n\nGiven that the average score is 90%, the total score across all five tests should be:\n\\[\n90\\% \\times 100 \\times 5 = 450\n\\]\n**Reflection:** Calculating the total score needed for a 90% average seems like a solid starting point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Sum of the First Three Tests**\n\nAdding up the known scores:\n\\[\n87 + 85 + 87 = 259\n\\]\n**Reflection:** This arithmetic seems correct. Let's move on.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Combined Score of the Last Two Tests**\n\nSubtracting the sum of the first three tests from the required total:\n\\[\n450 - 259 = 191\n\\]\n**Reflection:** So, the last two tests must sum up to 191 points. This aligns with our goal.\n\n**Quick Check:** Is 191 an even number? Hmm... Wait, but the problem states that the scores differ by three points. For two scores that differ by an odd number (like three), the sum should be odd. Uh-oh, there's a mismatch here.\n\n**Realization:** Wait, if the sum is 191 (odd) and the difference between the two scores is three (odd), then both scores cannot be integers because the sum of two numbers differing by an odd number should be even. This doesn't add up.\n\n**Interruption:** Maybe I've set up the equation incorrectly. Let's re-examine.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Revisiting the Equation Setup**\n\nMy initial equation was:\n\\[\nx + (x - 3) = 191\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n2x - 3 = 191\n\\]\n\\[\n2x = 194 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 97\n\\]\nSo, the higher score would be 97, and the lower score would be 94.\n\n**Reflection:** But wait, if the higher score is 97 and the lower is 94, their difference is 3, which matches the problem's requirement. But the sum of 97 and 94 is 191, which is odd. **But that\u2019s a contradiction because the sum should be even if the difference is odd.**\n\n**Conclusion:** There's a mistake somewhere. Let\u2019s brainstorm again.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy**\n\nMaybe the error is in how I've set up the variable relationship between the last two scores. Let's think differently.\n\n**Idea:** Instead of assuming the higher score is \\( x \\) and the lower is \\( x - 3 \\), perhaps the scores are \\( x \\) and \\( x + 3 \\). This way, the sum would still be 191 but could lead to different values.\n\nBut then again, if I sum \\( x \\) and \\( x + 3 \\), I get \\( 2x + 3 = 191 \\), which leads to:\n\\[\n2x = 188 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 94\n\\]\nSo, the scores would be 94 and 97.\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, if the scores are 94 and 97, their difference is indeed 3, and the sum is 191, which is odd. But perhaps I misinterpreted the relationship between the scores.\n\n**Realization:** Maybe I misunderstood how the difference is applied. The problem states that the last two scores differ by three points, which means one score is three points higher or lower than the other.\n\n**Alternative Setup:** Let's set the scores as \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), where \\( |x - y| = 3 \\). This could lead to more clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Setting Up the Correct Relationship**\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- \\( x \\) = higher score\n- \\( y \\) = lower score\n\nGiven:\n\\[\nx + y = 191\n\\]\n\\[\n|x - y| = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Now, we can set up two possible scenarios based on the absolute difference:\n\n1. **Case 1:** \\( x - y = 3 \\)\n2. **Case 2:** \\( y - x = 3 \\)\n\n**Let\u2019s Solve Both Cases:**\n\n---\n\n### **Case 1: \\( x - y = 3 \\)**\n\nAdd this to the sum equation:\n\\[\nx + y = 191 \n\\]\n\\[\nx - y = 3 \n\\]\n_________________\n\\[\n2x = 194 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 97\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 191 - 97 = 94\n\\]\n\n**Result:** Higher score \\( x = 97 \\), lower score \\( y = 94 \\).\n\n**Reflection:** This solution satisfies both the sum and the difference conditions. Let\u2019s check if it aligns with the 90% average requirement.\n\n---\n\n### **Case 2: \\( y - x = 3 \\)**\n\nThis would imply:\n\\[\ny + x = 191 \n\\]\n\\[\ny - x = 3 \n\\]\n_________________\n\\[\n2y = 194 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 97\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 191 - 97 = 94\n\\]\n\n**Result:** Higher score \\( y = 97 \\), lower score \\( x = 94 \\).\n\n**Reflection:** This is essentially the same as Case 1 and leads to the same scores but swapped roles. The sum remains 191, and the difference is still 3.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Solution**\n\nRegardless of which case we choose, the higher score is 97 and the lower score is 94.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Sum of Last Two Tests:** \\( 97 + 94 = 191 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Difference Between Last Two Tests:** \\( 97 - 94 = 3 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Average Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total Score} = 259 + 191 = 450 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Average} = \\frac{450}{5} = 90\\% \n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:** Everything checks out. The total score matches the required average, and the scores satisfy both the sum and difference conditions.\n\n**Realization:** By redefining the relationship between the last two scores, I was able to align the sum and difference correctly, resolving the initial contradiction.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe highest test score among Ed's five tests is **97**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies and carefully setting up the relationships between the test scores, I identified and corrected an initial error in my approach. This led me to the correct solution. Throughout the process, I checked each step to ensure consistency with the problem's requirements, which ultimately guided me to the accurate answer.\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough captures the natural thought process, including exploring various strategies, reflecting on each step, and making necessary adjustments along the way.

  "ground_truth": "Instead of adding up scores and figuring out the new averages, a quicker way (useful for the countdown round) is as follows:\n\nSince the average is 90, we first calculate how many points below 90 he already is: he's scored 87, 85, and 87, meaning that he is 3, 5, and 3 points below 90 respectively, making for a total of 11 points below.  We then know that his remaining two tests must be a combined 11 points above 90, and since they differ by 3 points, we know that one test is 4 above 90, and the other is 7 above 90, meaning his highest score was $\\boxed{97}$."
