    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into solving this problem by mimicking human thought processes\u2014brainstorming, exploring different strategies, checking our work frequently, and adjusting our approach as needed. This way, we can handle any confusion or errors along the way, just like a human would.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n- We have two functions: \\( f(x) = x + 3 \\) and \\( g(x) = x^2 - 6 \\).\n- The task is to find \\( f(g(2)) \\).\n- At first glance, this looks like a composition of functions, which reminds me of problems where you apply one function after another.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- I\u2019ve seen similar problems before where you need to evaluate one function inside another.\n- My gut tells me that I need to first compute \\( g(2) \\) and then use that result as the input for \\( f(x) \\).\n- But I'm not entirely sure if there are any additional steps or common pitfalls I should be aware of.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies: How to Proceed**\n\n**Strategy 1: Direct Computation**\n1. Compute \\( g(2) \\).\n2. Use the result to find \\( f(g(2)) \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- This seems straightforward\u2014calculate \\( g(2) \\) first, then plug that into \\( f(x) \\).\n- Wait, let me double-check if this approach is correct.\n\n**Check:**\n- Yes, that makes sense because function composition typically requires evaluating the inner function first.\n\n**Strategy 2: Verify by Reversing Order**\n- Consider evaluating \\( f(g(x)) \\) in general terms to see if my approach aligns.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- This might help confirm that computing \\( g(2) \\) first is indeed the right path.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- If I can show that \\( f(g(x)) = f \\) applied to \\( g(x) \\), then proceeding step-by-step with \\( g(2) \\) makes sense.\n\n**Strategy 3: Use Function Notation Appropriately**\n- Make sure to adhere to the order of operations in function composition: \\( f(g(x)) \\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Reiterating, the outer function \\( f \\) should be applied after computing the inner function \\( g \\).\n\n### **Deciding on the Approach**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Strategy 1 seems the most direct and logical: compute \\( g(2) \\) first, then use that result in \\( f(x) \\).\n- I'll proceed with this method, but I'll keep checking each step to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Compute \\( g(2) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Start with the inner function \\( g(x) = x^2 - 6 \\).\n- Substitute \\( x = 2 \\) into \\( g(x) \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\ng(2) = 2^2 - 6 = 4 - 6 = -2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Wait, let me quickly verify: \\( 2^2 = 4 \\), and \\( 4 - 6 = -2 \\).\n- Yes, that\u2019s correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The result makes sense. \\( g(2) = -2 \\).\n\n**Random Insight:**\n- This negative result might seem odd since we're dealing with functions that involve squaring and subtraction, but it checks out mathematically.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Compute \\( f(g(2)) = f(-2) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, take the result from \\( g(2) \\)\u2014which is \\( -2 \\)\u2014and apply it to the outer function \\( f(x) = x + 3 \\).\n- Need to ensure that adding 3 to \\( -2 \\) is done correctly.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nf(-2) = -2 + 3 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Let me see: \\( -2 + 3 = 1 \\).\n- Yes, that adds up correctly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The final result is \\( 1 \\).\n- This matches my expectation after adding \\( -2 \\) and \\( 3 \\).\n\n**Random Insight:**\n- Adding a positive number like 3 to a negative number like \\( -2 \\) balances out to 1. That seems logical.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Verifying the Entire Process**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Did I follow the correct order of operations? Yes, computed \\( g(2) \\) before applying \\( f \\).\n- Are the calculations correct? Checked each step, and they align mathematically.\n- Does the final answer make sense in the context of the functions given? Yes, it fits logically.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Everything checks out. The approach was straightforward, and each step led naturally to the next.\n- There's no need to rethink the strategy since the direct computation worked effectively.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n- By breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, I avoided getting overwhelmed and ensured accuracy at each stage.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe value of \\( f(g(2)) \\) is **1**. \n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, verifying each step, and reflecting on the process, I ensured a thorough and correct solution. This approach not only led to the right answer but also provided a clear pathway to understanding how function composition works in practice.",
