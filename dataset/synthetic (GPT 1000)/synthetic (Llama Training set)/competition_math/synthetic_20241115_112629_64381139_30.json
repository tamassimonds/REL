    "working_out": "### **Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. The function given is \\( j(x) = 2x^2 + 1 \\), and it's defined on the domain \\( [-1, 2] \\). The goal is to find the **range** of \\( j(x) \\), which means determining all possible output values of the function within that domain.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Familiar Function:** The expression \\( 2x^2 + 1 \\) looks like a quadratic function. Quadratics are functions where the highest exponent of the variable (here, \\( x \\)) is squared. I remember that quadratics generally have a parabolic shape, opening upwards if the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive, which it is here.\n\n- **Domain Limits:** Since the domain is restricted to \\( [-1, 2] \\), I need to consider only the values of \\( j(x) \\) for \\( x \\) within this interval.\n\n- **Maximum and Minimum Values:** To find the range, it seems logical to look for the **maximum** and **minimum** values of \\( j(x) \\) within this domain. Quadratics reach their extreme values at the **vertex** or the endpoints of the interval.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Vertex Method:** Calculate the vertex of the parabola to find the minimum or maximum value.\n   \n2. **Evaluate at Endpoints:** Check the values of \\( j(x) \\) at the endpoints \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n3. **Check for Critical Points:** Since the derivative of a quadratic can give critical points, I could find where \\( j'(x) = 0 \\) to see if there's any extremum inside the interval.\n\n4. **Graphical Approach:** Though not strictly required, sketching the graph could help visualize the range.\n\n**Wait a Minute...** Considering that the domain is limited, I don't need to look outside \\( [-1, 2] \\) for extrema\u2014only within this interval. Also, since the parabola opens upwards, the vertex will give me the minimum value, and the endpoints will likely give me the maximum.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Vertex of the Parabola**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I know that for a quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), the \\( x \\)-coordinate of the vertex is given by \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n- In our function \\( j(x) = 2x^2 + 1 \\), \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\) (since there's no \\( x \\) term).\n- So, let's calculate the vertex.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx_{\\text{vertex}} = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{0}{2 \\times 2} = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Okay, so the vertex is at \\( x = 0 \\).** Since this is within our domain \\( [-1, 2] \\), I should evaluate \\( j(0) \\) to find the minimum value.\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate \\( j(x) \\) at the Vertex \\( x = 0 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I expect \\( j(0) \\) to give me the **minimum** value since the parabola opens upwards.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nj(0) = 2(0)^2 + 1 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:** \n\n- **That makes sense.** The vertex gives the lowest point on the parabola, and I see that \\( j(0) = 1 \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate \\( j(x) \\) at the Endpoints \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the **maximum** value within the domain, I need to check the endpoints because for a quadratic, extrema can occur at the vertex or the endpoints.\n- Let's calculate \\( j(-1) \\) and \\( j(2) \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nj(-1) = 2(-1)^2 + 1 = 2 \\times 1 + 1 = 3\n\\]\n\n\\[\nj(2) = 2(2)^2 + 1 = 2 \\times 4 + 1 = 9\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Wait, \\( j(2) = 9 \\)?** That seems high, but looking at the function, it makes sense because \\( x \\) is squared, and multiplying by 2 increases it further.\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Range Based on the Calculated Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now I have:\n  - Minimum value: \\( j(0) = 1 \\)\n  - \\( j(-1) = 3 \\)\n  - \\( j(2) = 9 \\)\n- Since the parabola opens upwards, the minimum value is at the vertex, and the maximum value is at \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Let me double-check:** The function is continuous on the closed interval \\( [-1, 2] \\), so the range will indeed be the interval between the minimum and maximum values.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does this match my expectations?** Yes, the range should be from the lowest output (1) to the highest (9).\n\n### **Step 5: Express the Range as an Interval**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The range of \\( j(x) \\) is all the possible output values from the minimum to the maximum.\n- Since both endpoints are included (because \\( j(x) \\) is defined on a closed interval), the range can be expressed as \\( [1, 9] \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **That looks correct.** This interval includes all values between 1 and 9, which corresponds to the output of \\( j(x) \\) over the given domain.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Quick Verification:** \n  - **At \\( x = -1 \\):** \\( j(-1) = 3 \\)\n  - **At \\( x = 0 \\):** \\( j(0) = 1 \\) (minimum)\n  - **At \\( x = 2 \\):** \\( j(2) = 9 \\) (maximum)\n\n- **Is everything consistent?** Yes, the minimum and maximum values align with the vertex and endpoints, respectively.\n\n- **Does the range make sense?** Absolutely, the function is quadratic and continuous, so the range is indeed \\( [1, 9] \\).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014checking the vertex, evaluating endpoints, and confirming the function's properties\u2014I determined that the **range of \\( j(x) \\)** is \\( \\boxed{[1, 9]} \\). This means that \\( j(x) \\) will output values from 1 to 9, inclusive, when \\( x \\) is within the domain \\( [-1, 2] \\).",

  "ground_truth": "Note that $x^2$ assumes every value from $0$ to $4$, inclusive, as $x$ varies throughout the interval $[-1,2]$. Therefore, $j(x)$ assumes every value from $2(0)+1=1$ to $2(4)+1=9$ (and no other values). The range of $j(x)$ is $\\boxed{[1,9]}$."
