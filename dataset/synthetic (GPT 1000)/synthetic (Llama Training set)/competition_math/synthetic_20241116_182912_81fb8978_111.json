    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll take it step by step, thinking through different strategies, checking my work often, and reflecting along the way to ensure I'm on the right track. \n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the question about finding the exponent of \\(3\\) in the prime factorization of \\(24!\\), several things come to mind:\n\n- **Factorials:** I remember that \\(n!\\) is the product of all integers from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\). So, \\(24!\\) would be \\(24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times \\ldots \\times 2 \\times 1\\).\n  \n- **Prime Factorization:** This involves breaking down numbers into their prime components. I know that every number can be expressed as a product of primes, and the exponent tells us how many times each prime factor appears.\n\n- **Exponent of a Prime in Factorials:** There's a specific method to determine the exponent of a prime \\(p\\) in \\(n!\\) without fully decomposing \\(n!\\). I vaguely recall a formula involving multiples of \\(p\\), \\(p^2\\), etc.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Should I try calculating \\(24!\\) directly and then factor it? That seems impractical given the size. Maybe using the prime counting method is better? Or perhaps there's a step-by-step breakdown I can follow.\n\nAt this point, I'm leaning towards using the prime counting method because calculating \\(24!\\) directly would be cumbersome and time-consuming.\n\n---\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Factorization of \\(24!\\):**\n   - Idea: Compute \\(24!\\) and then factor it to find the exponent of \\(3\\).\n   - **Reflection:** This seems impractical; \\(24!\\) is a massive number, and direct factorization would be time-consuming and prone to error.\n\n2. **Using the Prime Counting Method:**\n   - Idea: Use a systematic approach to count how many times \\(3\\) is a factor in all numbers from \\(1\\) to \\(24\\).\n   - **Reflection:** This method makes more sense. I remember there's a formula involving dividing \\(n\\) by \\(p\\), \\(p^2\\), and so on until the quotient is zero.\n\n3. **Checking with Smaller Factorials:**\n   - Idea: Verify the method by applying it to smaller factorials where the calculation is feasible, like \\(5!\\) or \\(10!\\).\n   - **Reflection:** This could help verify that the approach works before applying it to \\(24!\\).\n\nGiven these options, I'll proceed with the Prime Counting Method, as it seems the most efficient and reliable.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach Using Prime Counting Method:**\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Prime Counting Method**\n\nThe idea behind this method is to count how many multiples of the prime \\(3\\), \\(3^2\\), \\(3^3\\), etc., are present in the numbers from \\(1\\) to \\(24\\). Each multiple contributes at least one \\(3\\) to the factorization. Higher powers of \\(3\\) contribute additional \\(3\\)s.\n\n- **Formula:** \n  \\[\n  \\text{Exponent of } 3 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{3^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{3^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n  \\]\n  Continue until \\(3^k\\) where \\(3^k > 24\\).\n\n**Step 2: Calculating Each Term**\n\nLet's compute each term one by one:\n\n- **First Term:** \n  \\[\n  \\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{3} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 8 \\right\\rfloor = 8\n  \\]\n  This counts all multiples of \\(3\\) from \\(1\\) to \\(24\\): \\(3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24\\).\n\n- **Second Term:** \n  \\[\n  \\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{9} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 2.67 \\right\\rfloor = 2\n  \\]\n  This counts multiples of \\(9\\) (which is \\(3^2\\)): \\(9, 18\\).\n\n- **Third Term:** \n  \\[\n  \\left\\lfloor \\frac{24}{27} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 0.89 \\right\\rfloor = 0\n  \\]\n  There are no multiples of \\(27\\) (which is \\(3^3\\)) up to \\(24\\).\n\n**Step 3: Summing the Exponents**\n\nNow, add up all the exponents from each term:\n\n\\[\n8 + 2 + 0 = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, the exponent of \\(3\\) in the prime factorization of \\(24!\\) is **10**.\n\n---\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does summing \\(8\\) and \\(2\\) make sense? Yes, \\(10\\) seems reasonable for the exponent of \\(3\\) in \\(24!\\).\n  \n- **Deeper Reflection:** \n  - The first term accounts for all numbers divisible by \\(3\\).\n  - The second term accounts for additional \\(3\\)s from numbers divisible by \\(9\\) (since each of these has an extra \\(3\\)).\n  - The third term is zero because \\(27 > 24\\).\n  \n  Everything adds up logically, and each step follows the prime counting method correctly.\n\n- **Alternative Check (Smaller Factorials):**\n  - For \\(5!\\): \n    \\[\n    \\left\\lfloor \\frac{5}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 1, \\quad \\left\\lfloor \\frac{5}{9} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\text{Exponent} = 1\n    \\]\n  - For \\(10!\\): \n    \\[\n    \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 3, \\quad \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{9} \\right\\rfloor = 1, \\quad \\left\\lfloor \\frac{10}{27} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\text{Exponent} = 4\n    \\]\n  \n  These match the expected results, confirming that the method works.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection and Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Strategy Effectiveness:** The Prime Counting Method was straightforward and efficient for this problem. It avoided the impracticality of direct factorial computation.\n\n- **Learning Point:** Always consider whether a direct approach is feasible or if there's a more efficient method, especially with large numbers like \\(24!\\).\n\n- **Mistake Acknowledgment:** Initially, I considered calculating \\(24!\\) directly, which would have been time-consuming. Realizing this led me to choose a better-suited strategy.\n\n- **Final Check:** All calculations align with the Prime Counting Method, and alternative checks with smaller factorials validate the approach. The exponent of \\(3\\) in the prime factorization of \\(24!\\) is confidently **10**.\n\n---\n\nBy thinking through each step, reflecting on the effectiveness of the strategies, and checking the work along the way, I've ensured a thorough and accurate solution to the problem.",

  "ground_truth": "Of the numbers from $1$ to $24$, eight of them are multiples of $3$, so that gives us an exponent of $8$.\n\nNow, two of the numbers are multiples of $3^2=9$, so each of them has $3$ as a factor twice. We've already counted them one each, so we need to count them each one more time. This adds another $2$ to the exponent.\n\nThe next thing to check is whether any of the numbers have $3$ as a factor three times. Happily, $3^3=27>24$, so we don't have any of those.\n\nOur total exponent is $8+2=\\boxed{10}$."
