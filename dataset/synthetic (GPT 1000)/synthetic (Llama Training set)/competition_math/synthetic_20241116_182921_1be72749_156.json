    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it the way I naturally would when tackling a question, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work along the way, and reflecting on whether each step makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I see the sequence **3, \\(\\frac{9}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{27}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{81}{8}\\), ...**, it immediately reminds me of a **geometric sequence** because each term seems to be derived from the previous one by multiplying by a constant factor. \n\nBut before jumping in, I want to brainstorm how geometric sequences work:\n\n- **Geometric Sequence Basics**: I recall that in a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed number called the **common ratio**.\n  \n- **Identifying Terms**: Maybe I can identify the common ratio by dividing successive terms.\n\n- **General Formula**: I remember that the \\(n\\)th term of a geometric sequence can be expressed as \\(a_n = a_1 \\times r^{(n-1)}\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term and \\(r\\) is the common ratio.\n\n- **Finding the Eighth Term**: To find the eighth term, I would need to know both the first term and the common ratio, then apply the formula.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm if this approach is correct by checking the sequence pattern a bit more thoroughly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Common Ratio \\(r\\)**\n\nLet's see if I can spot the common ratio by looking at the first few terms:\n\n- **From 3 to \\(\\frac{9}{2}\\)**: \n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{\\frac{9}{2}}{3} = \\frac{9/2}{3} = \\frac{9}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{9}{6} = \\frac{3}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **From \\(\\frac{9}{2}\\) to \\(\\frac{27}{4}\\)**:\n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{\\frac{27}{4}}{\\frac{9}{2}} = \\frac{27}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{27 \\times 2}{4 \\times 9} = \\frac{54}{36} = \\frac{3}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **From \\(\\frac{27}{4}\\) to \\(\\frac{81}{8}\\)**:\n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{\\frac{81}{8}}{\\frac{27}{4}} = \\frac{81}{8} \\times \\frac{4}{27} = \\frac{81 \\times 4}{8 \\times 27} = \\frac{324}{216} = \\frac{3}{2}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection**: Alright, each time I compute \\(r\\), I consistently get **\\(\\frac{3}{2}\\)**. This confirms that the common ratio is **\\(\\frac{3}{2}\\)**. \n\nI feel confident about this because all the calculations lead to the same ratio.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Geometric Sequence Formula**\n\nNow that I know the common ratio and the first term, I can use the geometric sequence formula to find the eighth term.\n\n- **Given**:\n  - First term, \\(a_1 = 3\\)\n  - Common ratio, \\(r = \\frac{3}{2}\\)\n  - Eighth term, \\(n = 8\\)\n\n- **Formula**:\n  \\[\n  a_n = a_1 \\times r^{(n-1)}\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculating \\(a_8\\)**:\n  \\[\n  a_8 = 3 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{(8-1)} = 3 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{7}\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process**: Now I need to compute \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{7}\\). This looks a bit big, but I remember that breaking it down into smaller parts might help.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Breaking Down the Exponentiation**\n\nExponentiating \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) to the power of 7 can be tricky, so let's simplify it step by step:\n\n1. **Start with Lower Powers**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{4}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{27}{8}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{81}{16}\n   \\]\n   \n   (Wait, let me quickly check if I'm multiplying correctly)\n   \n   - For \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^3\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{27}{8} = \\frac{3 \\times 9}{2 \\times 4} = \\frac{27}{8}\n     \\]\n     \n     Looks good so far.\n\n2. **Continuing Up to the Seventh Power**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{243}{32}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^6 = \\frac{729}{64}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^7 = \\frac{2187}{128}\n   \\]\n   \n   (Checking again if the pattern holds)\n   \n   - Multiplying \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) by \\(\\frac{729}{64}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3 \\times 729}{2 \\times 64} = \\frac{2187}{128}\n     \\]\n     \n     This seems correct.\n\n**Reflection**: Alright, after breaking it down, \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^7 = \\frac{2187}{128}\\). \n\nThis method of incrementally building up the exponent worked well and helped avoid mistakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Multiplying by the First Term**\n\nNow, let\u2019s multiply this result by the first term to find \\(a_8\\):\n\n\\[\na_8 = 3 \\times \\frac{2187}{128} = \\frac{3 \\times 2187}{128} = \\frac{6561}{128}\n\\]\n\n**Check**: Let me quickly verify the multiplication:\n\n- **Calculating \\(3 \\times 2187\\)**:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 2187 = 6561\n  \\]\n  \n  Yes, that\u2019s correct.\n\n**Reflection**: So, \\(a_8 = \\frac{6561}{128}\\). \n\nThis seems reasonable considering the pattern of the sequence.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Result**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's do a quick check to ensure everything aligns:\n\n- **Re-examining the Common Ratio**: \n  - Each term is multiplied by \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), and this has been consistently applied throughout.\n\n- **Checking the Exponentiation**: \n  - Breaking down \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^7\\) step by step ensured accuracy.\n\n- **Multiplying by the First Term**: \n  - The multiplication was straightforward, and a quick check confirms the correctness.\n\n**Thought Process**: Everything seems to align, and the calculations check out. \n\nThe approach was methodical: identifying the common ratio, applying the geometric sequence formula, carefully exponentiating, and final multiplication.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter working through each step and verifying the calculations:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{6561}{128}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nLooking back, my initial strategy involved identifying the common ratio and applying the geometric sequence formula, which is standard for such problems. \n\nBreaking down the exponentiation into smaller parts made it manageable, reducing the likelihood of errors. \n\nChecking each step ensured that the final answer was accurate.\n\nThis approach was effective, and the answer aligns with the sequence's pattern.\n\nOverall, thinking through each part naturally, reflecting along the way, and verifying calculations led to a correct and confident solution.",
