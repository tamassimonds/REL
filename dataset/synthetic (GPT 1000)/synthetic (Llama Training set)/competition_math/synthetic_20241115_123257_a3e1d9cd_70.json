    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process step by step, exploring different strategies, checking if they're correct, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I think, \"This is a counting problem involving different clothing items. It reminds me of basic combinatorics. Combinatorics often deals with making choices, like how many ways you can combine different items.\"\n\nBut right off the bat, I'm not entirely sure how to set it up. I think, \"So, I need to consider shirts, pants, and ties... but wait, the tie is optional. That adds an extra layer.\"\n\nInitial brainstorming leads me to consider different strategies:\n\n1. **Listing all possibilities**: But that might be too tedious with many combinations.\n2. **Using the multiplication principle**: This is often used in these kinds of problems.\n3. **Breaking it down into smaller parts**: Maybe calculate outfits with and without ties separately.\n\nI think I should start with the multiplication principle, as it's the most straightforward for this type of problem. But I need to be careful with the optional tie part.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Multiplication Principle**\n\nLet's lay out what the multiplication principle involves. It states that if you have multiple independent choices, the total number of combinations is the product of the number of choices for each item.\n\n**Items and their choices:**\n\n- **Shirts**: 6 options\n- **Pants**: 3 options\n- **Ties**: 4 options, but can also be \"no tie\"\n\nWait a second... Adding \"no tie\" means each outfit can either have one of the 4 ties or none, making it 5 options for ties.\n\n**So, let's recalculate:**\n\n- **Multiplication Principle**: Total outfits = Number of shirts \u00d7 Number of pants \u00d7 Number of tie options\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total outfits} = 6 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 90\n\\]\n\nHmm, 90 seems like a reasonable number. Let's reflect: Does this make sense? I've accounted for all shirts, all pants, and each tie possibility, including no tie.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking Strategy 1**\n\nI think, \"Wait, let me double-check this approach.\" \n\n- **Shirts**: Each shirt can be paired with any pants, which makes sense.\n- **Pants**: Each shirt-pants combination can then have a tie or no tie.\n- **Tie options**: Including the \"no tie\" adds an extra layer.\n\nOkay, the logic seems sound. I'm considering all combinations where each piece is independent of the others. \n\nBut to be absolutely sure, I'll explore another strategy to validate this.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Breakdown into Smaller Parts**\n\nMaybe I can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Outfits with a tie**\n2. **Outfits without a tie**\n\n**Part 1: Outfits with a tie**\n\n- **Shirts**: 6\n- **Pants**: 3\n- **Ties**: 4 (since we're choosing a tie)\n\nTotal for this part:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 72\n\\]\n\n**Part 2: Outfits without a tie**\n\n- **Shirts**: 6\n- **Pants**: 3\n- **Ties**: 1 (the \"no tie\" option)\n\nTotal for this part:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 18\n\\]\n\n**Combined Total:**\n\n\\[\n72 + 18 = 90\n\\]\n\nAh, interesting! Both strategies yield the same total. This reinforces the correctness of the solution. \n\n---\n\n### **Checking Strategy 2**\n\nI think, \"Let me see if this makes sense.\"\n\n- **Outfits with a tie**: 72 is reasonable compared to the total.\n- **Outfits without a tie**: 18 also makes sense given fewer options.\n\nAdding them up gives the total 90, which aligns with the first strategy.\n\nI feel confident now that the answer is correct. \n\nBut let me reflect one more time: \n\n- **Have I considered all possibilities?** Yes, every shirt-pants combination either has a tie or no tie.\n- **Does the total seem reasonable?** Yes, 90 is a manageable number of combinations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAfter exploring both strategies and checking my work, I conclude that the total number of outfits is **90**.\n\nI started with the multiplication principle, which seemed logical, but then double-checked by breaking the problem into two distinct parts: outfits with and without a tie. Both approaches led to the same answer, confirming its correctness.\n\nThroughout the process, I made sure to reflect and verify each step, ensuring that every possibility was accounted for. This methodical approach helped catch any potential oversights and solidified the final result.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of outfits you can make is **90**.\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, checking each step, and validating the results, I've arrived at a confident and accurate solution.",
