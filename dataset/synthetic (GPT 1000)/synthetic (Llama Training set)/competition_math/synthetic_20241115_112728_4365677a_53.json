    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem: **Simplify the expression \\(\\sqrt{28 + \\sqrt{1296}}\\)**. \n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this, I think: \n- **Mixed Radicals:** There\u2019s a square root inside another square root. This reminds me of problems where you can simplify nested radicals.\n- **Perfect Squares:** The number 1296 is a large number; I wonder if it\u2019s a perfect square because that might make things easier.\n- **Order of Operations:** I need to be careful with the order of operations to ensure I\u2019m simplifying correctly.\n\nBut honestly, I\u2019m not entirely sure how to proceed right away. This looks a bit tricky, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Simplify Inner Radical First:** Maybe start by simplifying \\(\\sqrt{1296}\\) and see what I get. If 1296 is a perfect square, this could simplify nicely.\n\n2. **Check for Perfect Squares:** Since \\(\\sqrt{1296}\\) is involved, perhaps recognizing it as a perfect square could lead to a straightforward simplification.\n\n3. **Alternative Approaches:** If simplifying \\(\\sqrt{1296}\\) directly doesn\u2019t lead me anywhere, I could consider other methods like rationalizing or using properties of radicals.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first strategy: simplifying \\(\\sqrt{1296}\\).\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify \\(\\sqrt{1296}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I recall that 1296 is a large number, but perfect squares can be pretty common in problems like this.\n- Let me try checking if 1296 is a perfect square.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- If I remember correctly, there\u2019s a pattern with perfect squares. Let\u2019s see if 1296 is \\((36)^2\\):  \n  \\[\n  36 \\times 36 = 1296\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Wait, let me double-check this:  \n  \\[\n  36 \\times 36 = 1296 \\quad \\text{(correct)}\n  \\]\n  \nSo, \\(\\sqrt{1296} = 36\\).\n\n**Check:** That seems right because \\(36^2 = 1296\\).\n\n### **Step 2: Substitute Back into the Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now that I know \\(\\sqrt{1296} = 36\\), I can substitute this back into the original expression:  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{28 + \\sqrt{1296}} = \\sqrt{28 + 36}\n  \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Simplify inside the square root:  \n  \\[\n  28 + 36 = 64\n  \\]\n  \n- Then, take the square root:  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{64} = 8\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:** Okay, that was straightforward after simplifying \\(\\sqrt{1296}\\).\n\n### **Step 3: Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before finalizing, let me double-check each step to ensure everything is correct.\n\n**Check:**\n- Is \\(\\sqrt{1296} = 36\\)? Yes, because \\(36 \\times 36 = 1296\\).\n- Does \\(28 + 36 = 64\\)? Yes.\n- Is \\(\\sqrt{64} = 8\\)? Yes, because \\(8 \\times 8 = 64\\).\n\nEverything checks out. The approach seems correct.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy (If Needed)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- What if I didn\u2019t recognize 1296 as a perfect square? Maybe I could factor it:\n  \n  \\[\n  1296 = 36 \\times 36\n  \\]\n  \n- But since I identified it as a perfect square right away, this wasn\u2019t necessary.\n\n**Reflection:** Sometimes, recognizing patterns (like perfect squares) can make the problem much easier. If I hadn\u2019t noticed this, factoring might have been the next step.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter simplifying step by step and verifying each calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{28 + \\sqrt{1296}} = 8\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy first simplifying the inner radical \\(\\sqrt{1296}\\) to get 36, I was able to reduce the expression to \\(\\sqrt{64}\\), which simplifies neatly to 8. Throughout the process, checking each step ensured the correctness of the final answer. When tackling such problems, recognizing patterns like perfect squares can significantly streamline the solution.",
