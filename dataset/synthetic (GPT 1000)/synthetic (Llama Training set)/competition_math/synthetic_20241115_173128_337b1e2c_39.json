I'll make sure to show my thought process, even if it gets a bit messy or requires changing directions.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the inequality \\((n - 2)(n + 4) < 0\\), my immediate reaction is to recall similar problems involving quadratic inequalities. It reminds me of solving inequalities by finding where a quadratic expression is positive or negative. \n\nBut then I think, \"Wait, is this a standard quadratic inequality, or does it have unique elements I've overlooked?\" I remember that inequalities involving products can often be solved by analyzing the signs of each factor involved.\n\nAnother thought is, \"Should I try to expand the expression, or perhaps it's better to leave it in factored form?\" Expanding might complicate things, so keeping it factored seems wiser at this stage.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Sign Analysis Method:** \n   - Determine where each factor \\((n - 2)\\) and \\((n + 4)\\) is positive or negative.\n   - Identify the intervals where their product is negative.\n\n2. **Graphical Approach:**\n   - Sketch the graph of the quadratic function \\(y = (n - 2)(n + 4)\\).\n   - Visualize where the graph lies below the x-axis.\n\n3. **Algebraic Method:**\n   - Solve the equation \\((n - 2)(n + 4) = 0\\) to find critical points and test intervals.\n\n#### **Initial Strategy Choice**\n\nI'll start with the **Sign Analysis Method** since it seems straightforward for inequalities involving products. If that doesn't work or gets complicated, I'll consider switching to the graphical approach or the algebraic method.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Sign Analysis Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's break down the inequality \\((n - 2)(n + 4) < 0\\) by analyzing the signs of each factor. The product is negative when one factor is positive and the other is negative.\n\n**Actions:**\n\n1. **Identify Critical Points:**\n   - Set each factor to zero:\n     - \\(n - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow n = 2\\)\n     - \\(n + 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow n = -4\\)\n\n2. **Determine Sign Intervals:**\n   - These critical points divide the number line into three intervals:\n     - \\( (-\\infty, -4) \\)\n     - \\( (-4, 2) \\)\n     - \\( (2, \\infty) \\)\n\n3. **Test Each Interval:**\n   - Choose a test point from each interval to determine the sign of the product \\((n - 2)(n + 4)\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Interval \\( (-\\infty, -4) \\):**\n  - Test point: \\(n = -5\\)\n  - \\((n - 2) = -7\\), \\((n + 4) = -1\\)\n  - Product: \\((-7) \\times (-1) = 7\\) (Positive)\n\n- **Interval \\( (-4, 2) \\):**\n  - Test point: \\(n = 0\\)\n  - \\((n - 2) = -2\\), \\((n + 4) = 4\\)\n  - Product: \\((-2) \\times 4 = -8\\) (Negative)\n\n- **Interval \\( (2, \\infty) \\):**\n  - Test point: \\(n = 3\\)\n  - \\((n - 2) = 1\\), \\((n + 4) = 7\\)\n  - Product: \\(1 \\times 7 = 7\\) (Positive)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe product is negative in the interval \\( (-4, 2) \\). This makes sense because the critical points \\(n = -4\\) and \\(n = 2\\) are where the product changes sign.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Integer Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I know the inequality \\((n - 2)(n + 4) < 0\\) holds true for \\(n\\) in the interval \\( (-4, 2) \\), I need to identify all integers within this range.\n\n**Actions:**\n\n1. **List Integer Values:**\n   - Consider integers \\(n\\) such that \\( -4 < n < 2 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- The integers that satisfy this inequality are:\n  - \\(n = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1\\)\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet's quickly verify:\n\n- \\(n = -3\\): \\((-3 - 2)(-3 + 4) = (-5)(1) = -5\\) (Negative)\n- \\(n = -2\\): \\((-2 - 2)(-2 + 4) = (-4)(2) = -8\\) (Negative)\n- \\(n = -1\\): \\((-1 - 2)(-1 + 4) = (-3)(3) = -9\\) (Negative)\n- \\(n = 0\\): \\((0 - 2)(0 + 4) = (-2)(4) = -8\\) (Negative)\n- \\(n = 1\\): \\((1 - 2)(1 + 4) = (-1)(5) = -5\\) (Negative)\n\nAll these values make the product negative, confirming they are indeed solutions.\n\n**Humans Always Double-Check:**\n\nWait, let me ensure I'm not including the endpoints \\(n = -4\\) and \\(n = 2\\) because the inequality is strict (\\(< 0\\)), meaning the product cannot be zero.\n\n- \\(n = -4\\): \\((-4 - 2)(-4 + 4) = (-6)(0) = 0\\) (Not included)\n- \\(n = 2\\): \\((2 - 2)(2 + 4) = (0)(6) = 0\\) (Not included)\n\nSo, the integers \\(n = -4\\) and \\(n = 2\\) are correctly excluded.\n\n### **Step 3: Counting the Integer Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI have the list of integers \\(n = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1\\) that satisfy the inequality. Now, I simply need to count them.\n\n**Actions:**\n\n1. **Total Count:**\n   - There are five integers in the list.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis count makes sense based on the range \\( (-4, 2) \\). I can quickly check by listing:\n\n- \\(n = -3\\): 1\n- \\(n = -2\\): 2\n- \\(n = -1\\): 3\n- \\(n = 0\\): 4\n- \\(n = 1\\): 5\n\nTotal: 5 integers.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes this align with expectations? The range from \\(-4\\) to \\(2\\) includes five integer points, excluding the endpoints. So, everything checks out.\n\n### **Step 4: Alternative Strategy\u2014Graphical Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure the solution is correct, let's consider another method\u2014graphing the quadratic function \\(y = (n - 2)(n + 4)\\) and identifying where it lies below the x-axis (i.e., where the inequality holds).\n\n**Actions:**\n\n1. **Sketch the Graph:**\n   - The graph is a parabola opening upwards (since the coefficient of \\(n^2\\) is positive).\n   - The x-intercepts are at \\(n = -4\\) and \\(n = 2\\).\n   - The vertex lies at \\(n = \\frac{-4 + 2}{2} = -1\\).\n\n2. **Analyze the Graph:**\n   - Since the parabola opens upwards, it will be below the x-axis between the roots \\(n = -4\\) and \\(n = 2\\).\n   - This confirms that the inequality \\((n - 2)(n + 4) < 0\\) holds for \\(n\\) in \\( (-4, 2) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis graphical approach reinforces the result obtained using the sign analysis method. Both methods agree on the solution set.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore concluding, let's do a final check to ensure everything is correct.\n\n**Actions:**\n\n1. **Revisit Critical Points:**\n   - Confirm that \\(n = -4\\) and \\(n = 2\\) are the points where the expression equals zero.\n\n2. **Ensure Proper Interval Testing:**\n   - Re-check the signs in each interval to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **At \\(n = -4\\):**\n  - \\((n - 2)(n + 4) = (\u22126)(0) = 0\\) (Boundary, not included)\n\n- **At \\(n = 2\\):**\n  - \\((n - 2)(n + 4) = (0)(6) = 0\\) (Boundary, not included)\n\nEverything aligns perfectly. The intervals were tested correctly, and the integer solutions have been accurately identified and counted.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThere are **5 integers** \\(n\\) that satisfy the inequality \\((n - 2)(n + 4) < 0\\):\n\n\\[\nn = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy exploring different strategies\u2014starting with the sign analysis method and verifying through the graphical approach\u2014I ensured the solution was robust. Reflecting and checking at each step helped catch potential errors early, leading to a confident and correct answer.",
