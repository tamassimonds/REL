I'll write out my thought process naturally, including initial brainstorming, exploring different strategies, checking work frequently, and adjusting approaches as needed.\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, staring at the problem:  \n**If \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 4, and \\( g(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 2, then what is the degree of the polynomial \\( f(x) - g(x) \\)?**\n\nHmm, at first glance, this reminds me of polynomial degree properties I've encountered before. I know that the degree of a polynomial is determined by its highest exponent. Combining polynomials, especially subtracting them, usually involves looking at the degrees of the individual polynomials and seeing how they interact.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how the degree of the difference works. I recall that when adding or subtracting polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is typically determined by the highest degree term that doesn't get canceled out. But what if terms of the same degree exist in both polynomials? Would they cancel? \n\nThinking about it, I remember that only like terms can cancel each other out, and even then, if they cancel, the degree could be affected. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. Maybe I should explore a few different strategies to see which makes the most sense.\n\n---\n\n## **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Approach:**\n   - Just consider the degrees and see if the higher degree polynomial's terms dominate.\n   \n2. **Example Polynomials:**\n   - Create specific examples of \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) to see how their degrees interact when subtracted.\n   \n3. **Theoretical Approach:**\n   - Use polynomial properties to determine the degree without needing specific examples.\n\nMaybe starting with direct examples will help build intuition, and then I can verify using theoretical properties. Let's try that.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Exploring with Example Polynomials**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s take specific polynomials to see how the degrees behave when subtracted. This should give me a clearer picture.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n- \\( f(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 5 \\) (Degree 4)\n- \\( g(x) = x^2 + 3 \\) (Degree 2)\n\n**Subtracting \\( g(x) \\) from \\( f(x) \\):**\n\n\\[\nf(x) - g(x) = (x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 5) - (x^2 + 3)\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\nf(x) - g(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 + (x^2 - x^2) + (5 - 3) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThe highest degree term remaining is \\( x^4 \\). So, the degree of \\( f(x) - g(x) \\) is 4.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis aligns with what I expected. The degree 4 term in \\( f(x) \\) didn't have a corresponding term in \\( g(x) \\), so it remains in the difference.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n- \\( f(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 5 \\) (Degree 4)\n- \\( g(x) = 2x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 3 \\) (Degree 2)\n\n**Subtracting \\( g(x) \\) from \\( f(x) \\):**\n\n\\[\nf(x) - g(x) = (x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 5) - (2x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 3)\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\nf(x) - g(x) = (x^4 - 2x^4) + (2x^3 - x^3) + (x^2 - x^2) + (5 - 3) = -x^4 + x^3 + 2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThe highest degree term is now \\( -x^4 \\). So, the degree is still 4.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIn this case, the degree 4 term in \\( g(x) \\) had a matching term in \\( f(x) \\), but subtracting them left the highest degree term with a coefficient of \\(-1\\). The degree remains 4 because the highest exponent term doesn\u2019t cancel out.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n- \\( f(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 5 \\) (Degree 4)\n- \\( g(x) = x^2 + 3 \\) (Degree 2)\n\nAgain, subtracting:\n\n\\[\nf(x) - g(x) = (x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 5) - (x^2 + 3) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThe degree remains 4.\n\n**Observation:**  \nIn all cases, the highest degree term from \\( f(x) \\) persisted in the result, regardless of the degree of \\( g(x) \\).\n\n**Thought:**  \nIt seems that as long as \\( f(x) \\) has a degree higher than \\( g(x) \\), the degree of the difference \\( f(x) - g(x) \\) remains the same as the degree of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**But wait, what if there's a degree 4 term in both polynomials, like in Example 2?**  \nEven then, the degree remains 4 because the subtraction doesn\u2019t eliminate the highest degree term; it only changes its coefficient.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Theoretical Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I\u2019ve seen multiple examples supporting the idea that the degree remains 4, let\u2019s verify this using polynomial properties.\n\n**Property:**  \nWhen subtracting two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the highest degree of the terms that don\u2019t cancel out.\n\n**Given:**\n\n- \\( f(x) \\) has a degree of 4.\n- \\( g(x) \\) has a degree of 2.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Highest Degree in \\( f(x) \\):**  \n   The term \\( x^4 \\) in \\( f(x) \\) dominates because no corresponding \\( x^4 \\) term exists in \\( g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Possible Cancellation:**  \n   For the degree to be lower than 4, there would need to be an \\( x^4 \\) term in \\( g(x) \\) that cancels with \\( f(x) \\). However, \\( g(x) \\) only goes up to degree 2.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**  \n   Since there\u2019s no \\( x^4 \\) term in \\( g(x) \\) to cancel the \\( x^4 \\) term in \\( f(x) \\), the degree of \\( f(x) - g(x) \\) remains 4.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis theoretical approach aligns with what we observed in the example polynomials. The degree stays 4 because the highest degree term in \\( f(x) \\) doesn\u2019t have a counterpart in \\( g(x) \\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Considering Potential Edge Cases**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s brainstorm any possible scenarios where the degree might not remain 4. It's essential to ensure that our conclusion holds under all conditions.\n\n**Scenario 1: Both Polynomials Have \\( x^4 \\) Terms**\n\n- **Example:**  \n  \\( f(x) = x^4 + x^2 \\)  \n  \\( g(x) = x^4 + 3 \\)\n\n  **Subtracting:**\n\n  \\[\n  f(x) - g(x) = (x^4 + x^2) - (x^4 + 3) = (x^4 - x^4) + x^2 - 3 = x^2 - 3\n  \\]\n\n  **Check:**  \n  Here, the \\( x^4 \\) term cancels out, leaving \\( x^2 \\). So, the degree is now 2.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis is a critical observation. While in most cases where \\( g(x) \\) is of lower degree, the degree remains that of \\( f(x) \\), if both polynomials have \\( x^4 \\) terms, and they cancel each other out, the degree can drop.\n\n**Scenario 2: Higher Degree Terms in \\( g(x) \\)**\n\n- **Example:**  \n  Suppose \\( g(x) \\) had a term like \\( 3x^4 \\).\n\n  **Example Setup:**\n\n  \\( f(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 5 \\)  \n  \\( g(x) = 3x^4 + x^2 + 3 \\)\n\n  **Subtracting:**\n\n  \\[\n  f(x) - g(x) = (x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 5) - (3x^4 + x^2 + 3) = (x^4 - 3x^4) + 2x^3 + (x^2 - x^2) + (5 - 3) = -2x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\n  \\]\n\n  **Check:**  \n  The highest degree term remaining is \\( -2x^4 \\). So, the degree is still 4.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEven with a higher degree term in \\( g(x) \\), as long as it doesn\u2019t completely cancel out the corresponding term in \\( f(x) \\), the degree of the resulting polynomial remains 4. In this case, the \\( x^4 \\) term in \\( f(x) \\) was scaled but not canceled.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe key takeaway is that for the degree of \\( f(x) - g(x) \\) to drop below 4, there must be an \\( x^4 \\) term in both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) that perfectly cancels each other out. Otherwise, the degree remains 4.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s do a quick recap to ensure everything aligns with our initial observations and theoretical understanding.\n\n1. **Example Tests:**  \n   - In examples where \\( g(x) \\) had no \\( x^4 \\) term, the degree remained 4.\n   - In the edge case where both polynomials had \\( x^4 \\) terms, and they canceled out, the degree dropped to 2.\n\n2. **Theoretical Verification:**  \n   - The property of polynomial degrees during subtraction supports the findings.\n\n3. **Edge Cases Considered:**  \n   - If \\( g(x) \\) has an \\( x^4 \\) term that cancels with \\( f(x) \\), the degree can lower; otherwise, it remains 4.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The initial intuition was correct, but exploring edge cases highlighted that the degree could drop if both polynomials have matching highest-degree terms that cancel each other.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\n**Approach:**  \nAfter considering various strategies\u2014testing with specific polynomials, verifying through theoretical properties, and exploring edge cases\u2014I conclude that the degree of the polynomial \\( f(x) - g(x) \\) is **4**, unless the \\( x^4 \\) term in \\( f(x) \\) is canceled out by a corresponding term in \\( g(x) \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**The degree of \\( f(x) - g(x) \\) is 4.**\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step walkthrough, complete with brainstorming, reflection, and checking, provides clarity on how to approach such polynomial degree problems!",
