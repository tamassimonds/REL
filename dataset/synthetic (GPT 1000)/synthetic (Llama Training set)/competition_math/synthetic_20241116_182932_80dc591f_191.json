    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like how I would tackle a problem naturally. Here we go:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so I see the function \\( f(x) \\) is defined piecewise:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\begin{cases} \n2x + 7 & \\text{if } x < -2 \\\\ \n-x^2 - x + 1 & \\text{if } x \\ge -2 \n\\end{cases} \n\\]\n\nAnd I need to find the **sum of all values of \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = -5 \\)**.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Piecewise Functions:** I remember that with piecewise functions, I need to consider each case separately based on the domain.\n- **Setting \\( f(x) = -5 \\):** This suggests solving equations within each piece to find specific \\( x \\)-values.\n- **Potential Strategies:**\n  1. Solve \\( 2x + 7 = -5 \\) for \\( x < -2 \\).\n  2. Solve \\( -x^2 - x + 1 = -5 \\) for \\( x \\ge -2 \\).\n  3. Check if there are any \\( x \\)-values that satisfy both pieces (though unlikely because of the strict inequalities).\n\n**Immediate Thoughts:**\n- This looks similar to solving linear and quadratic equations separately.\n- I should double-check which part of the piecewise function each solution belongs to ensure validity.\n- It's essential to consider the boundaries, especially at \\( x = -2 \\), to determine which piece applies.\n\n### **Step 1: Solve \\( 2x + 7 = -5 \\) for \\( x < -2 \\)**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Since \\( f(x) = 2x + 7 \\) when \\( x < -2 \\), I'll set up the equation \\( 2x + 7 = -5 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n2x + 7 = -5 \\\\\n2x = -5 - 7 \\\\\n2x = -12 \\\\\nx = \\frac{-12}{2} = -6\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- \\( x = -6 \\) is less than \\( -2 \\), so it falls within the correct domain for this piece.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Quick Check:** \\( 2(-6) + 7 = -12 + 7 = -5 \\), which matches the required \\( f(x) = -5 \\).\n- This solution seems correct. But let me double-check if any other \\( x \\)-values might work.\n\n### **Step 2: Solve \\( -x^2 - x + 1 = -5 \\) for \\( x \\ge -2 \\)**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Now, considering the second piece, set \\( -x^2 - x + 1 = -5 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n-x^2 - x + 1 = -5 \\\\\n-x^2 - x + 1 + 5 = 0 \\\\\n-x^2 - x + 6 = 0 \\\\\nx^2 + x - 6 = 0 \\quad \\text{(Multiplying by -1 to make it easier)}\n\\]\n\n**Solving the Quadratic Equation:**\n- I'll factor the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \\).\n\n\\[\nx^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Finding the Roots:**\n\\[\nx + 3 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -3 \\\\\nx - 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- \\( x = -3 \\): This is **not** within the domain \\( x \\ge -2 \\), so it doesn't qualify.\n- \\( x = 2 \\): This is within the domain.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Quick Check for \\( x = 2 \\):** \\( -x^2 - x + 1 = -4 - 2 + 1 = -5 \\), which is correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Only \\( x = 2 \\) is a valid solution from this piece.\n\n### **Step 3: Consider the Boundary at \\( x = -2 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- It's crucial to check the boundary because \\( f(x) \\) changes definition at \\( x = -2 \\).\n- However, the condition is \\( x \\ge -2 \\), so \\( x = -2 \\) is included in the second piece.\n\n**Check for \\( f(-2) = -5 \\):**\n\\[\nf(-2) = -(-2)^2 - (-2) + 1 = -4 + 2 + 1 = -1 \\quad \\text{(Not } -5\\text{)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Conclusion:** \\( x = -2 \\) does **not** satisfy \\( f(x) = -5 \\), so it doesn't contribute to the sum.\n\n### **Step 4: Summing Up the Valid \\( x \\)-Values**\n\n**Valid Solutions:**\n- From Step 1: \\( x = -6 \\)\n- From Step 2: \\( x = 2 \\)\n\n**Sum:**\n\\[\n-6 + 2 = -4\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** Adding these numbers gives \\( -4 \\), which seems reasonable.\n- **Reflection:** Double-checking the solutions:\n  - \\( f(-6) = 2(-6) + 7 = -12 + 7 = -5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - \\( f(2) = -2^2 - 2 + 1 = -4 - 2 + 1 = -5 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  \nBoth solutions satisfy \\( f(x) = -5 \\) within their respective domains.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies:** Initially thought about solving each piece separately, which worked well.\n- **Boundary Check:** Essential to verify \\( x = -2 \\), confirming it doesn't contribute.\n- **Sum Calculation:** Simple addition of valid \\( x \\)-values.\n- **Mistake Avoidance:** Ensured only valid \\( x \\)-values within their domains were considered.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{-4}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Brainstorming Throughout:** Started by exploring different strategies, reflected often, and adjusted the approach as needed.\n- **Checking Work:** Regular checks ensured the correctness of solutions.\n- **Dealing with Confusion:** When unsure, revisited the problem details and confirmed each step's validity.\n\nThis step-by-step, reflective approach ensured that the solution was thorough and correct, mirroring natural human problem-solving.",
