    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, mimicking a natural human thought process. I'll brainstorm various strategies, reflect frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's start by exploring the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:  \n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{3}{6}\\right)\\left(\\frac{6}{9}\\right)\\left(\\frac{9}{12}\\right)\\cdots\\left(\\frac{2001}{2004}\\right)\n\\]\nThis expression involves multiplying a series of fractions where both the numerator and denominator follow a specific pattern. My initial thoughts are:\n\n1. **Cancellation of Terms:** Perhaps there's a telescoping effect where terms cancel each other out.\n2. **Simplifying Individual Fractions:** Maybe simplifying each fraction first could reveal a pattern.\n3. **Finding a General Formula:** Another approach could be to find a formula for the \\( n \\)-th term to see if there's a simplification across the series.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not sure which strategy will work best right now. Let me brainstorm and see where each path leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Cancellation of Terms (Telescoping Product):**  \n   - Maybe each fraction shares a component with the next, allowing for cancelation.\n  \n2. **Simplify Each Fraction Individually:**  \n   - Simplifying each fraction before multiplying to see a reduced form.\n  \n3. **Express as a Ratio of Factorials:**  \n   - Expressing the product in terms of factorials might give a clearer picture.\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition:**  \n   - Looking for a pattern or formula that defines the entire product.\n\nLet me try the **Cancellation of Terms** strategy first because it's often effective with products and series.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Cancellation of Terms**\n\n**Attempt:**  \nLet\u2019s see if there's a common factor between consecutive fractions that cancels out.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf each fraction cancels part of the next, maybe only the first numerator and the last denominator remain. This would drastically simplify the product.\n\n**Trying to Apply This:**  \nLooking at the first few fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{6}, \\frac{6}{9}, \\frac{9}{12}, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n- \\(\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{3}{4}\\)\n\nSo, each fraction simplifies by reducing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n**Possible Cancelling Idea:**  \nMaybe the numerator of each fraction cancels with the denominator of the next.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{6} \\times \\frac{6}{9} \\times \\frac{9}{12} \\times \\cdots \\times \\frac{2001}{2004}\n\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right because the \\(6\\) in the numerator of the second fraction and the \\(6\\) in the denominator of the first fraction don't align like in telescoping series for sums.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, this doesn\u2019t seem to work because the terms aren't set up to cancel like a telescoping series for addition. I think I need to rethink this approach. Maybe cancellation isn't as straightforward here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Trying Simplifying Each Fraction Individually**\n\n**New Approach:**  \nLet\u2019s simplify each fraction before multiplying to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf simplifying reveals a consistent pattern, perhaps we can find a formula to apply across all terms.\n\n**Simplify the Fractions:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}, \\quad \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{3}{4}, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad \\frac{2001}{2004} = \\frac{667}{668}\n\\]\n\n**Looking for a Pattern:**  \nThe fractions seem to reduce by dividing numerator and denominator by their GCD.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{n+3}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( n \\) is the simplified numerator. But I notice that the numerators \\(3, 6, 9, \\ldots, 2001\\) can be expressed as multiples of \\(3\\):  \n\\[\n3 \\times 1, \\quad 3 \\times 2, \\quad 3 \\times 3, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad 3 \\times 667\n\\]\n\n**Pattern Identified:**  \nSo, the numerators are \\(3k\\) where \\(k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 667\\). Therefore, the fractions can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n\\frac{3k}{3k + 3} = \\frac{k}{k + 1}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis simplification looks promising! Each fraction reduces to \\(\\frac{k}{k + 1}\\), which seems more straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Expressing the Entire Product Using the New Pattern**\n\n**Applying the Pattern:**  \nNow, the product becomes:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times \\left(\\frac{667}{668}\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Rewriting the Product:**  \nThis is:\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=1}^{667} \\frac{k}{k + 1}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis looks like a telescoping product, where terms from the numerator and denominator will cancel out across the series.\n\n**Strategy Check:**  \nWait, that seems like it should work. Each \\(k\\) in the numerator cancels with \\(k + 1\\) in the denominator of the next fraction.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet me write out a few terms to see if the cancellation happens as expected.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\cdots \\times \\frac{667}{668}\n\\]\n  \n**Expanding the Product:**\n\\[\n\\frac{1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times \\cdots \\times 667}{2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times \\cdots \\times 668}\n\\]\n\n**Noticing a Telescoping Effect:**  \nMost terms in the numerator and denominator will cancel out.\n\n**Simplified Form:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{668}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHold on, let me double-check this cancellation. If the numerator cancels with the denominator of the next fraction, that should leave only the first numerator and the last denominator.\n\n**Rechecking:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times \\cdots \\times 667}{2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times \\cdots \\times 668} = \\frac{667!}{668!}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{667!}{668 \\times 667!} = \\frac{1}{668}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nYes, the product simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{668}\\). Each \\(k\\) in the numerator cancels with \\(k\\) in the denominator of the next fraction, leaving only the initial numerator \\(1\\) and the final denominator \\(668\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{668}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Review**\n\n1. **Brainstorming Worked:**  \n   Starting with cancellation didn't quite fit, but simplifying each fraction and recognizing the telescoping pattern led to the correct solution.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition Key:**  \n   Identifying that each fraction reduced to \\(\\frac{k}{k + 1}\\) was crucial.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Verification:**  \n   Checking the product term by term ensured the cancellation was correct.\n\n4. **Reflection and Adjustment:**  \n   Initially misapplying cancellation led to rethinking the strategy, which ultimately guided to the right path.\n\n5. **Final Check:**  \n   Confirming that all intermediate steps simplified correctly validated the final answer.\n\nLetting the thought process flow naturally\u2014messy at the beginning, but with reflection and adjustments, it led to the correct solution\u2014mirrors how a human would tackle the problem.",
