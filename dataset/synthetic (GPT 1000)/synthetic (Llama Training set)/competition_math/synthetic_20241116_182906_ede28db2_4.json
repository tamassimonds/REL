    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together and tackle it step by step, just like I would if I was working on it myself. I'll brainstorm a bit to get my thoughts organized, explore different strategies, and reflect often to make sure I'm on the right track. Let's see where this takes us!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, I see a system of linear equations with three variables: \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The goal is to find \\(2a + 2b + 2c\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Systems of Equations:** This reminds me of problems where we solve for multiple variables simultaneously. I think I've dealt with these using substitution or elimination methods before.\n- **Symmetry:** The equations are balanced with each variable appearing in two equations. This symmetry might be useful.\n- **Target Expression:** The expression \\(2a + 2b + 2c\\) can be factored as \\(2(a + b + c)\\). Maybe finding \\(a + b + c\\) directly could simplify things.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Substitution Method:** Solve one equation for a variable and substitute it into the others.\n2. **Elimination Method:** Use addition or subtraction of equations to eliminate variables step by step.\n3. **Adding All Equations:** Perhaps adding all three equations together to find a relationship between \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n4. **Matrix Methods:** Although not always necessary for three equations, setting up a matrix could provide a structured approach.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Substitution and Elimination** are standard methods for systems like this. Since the target expression is a multiple of \\(a + b + c\\), maybe adding all equations is a good starting point.\n\n### **Step 1: Adding All Equations Together**\n\nLet's try adding all three equations to see what we get:\n\n\\[\n(b + c) + (a + c) + (a + b) = (12 - 3a) + (-14 - 3b) + (7 - 3c)\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Left Side:**\n\n\\[\nb + c + a + c + a + b = 2a + 2b + 2c\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Right Side:**\n\n\\[\n(12 - 3a) + (-14 - 3b) + (7 - 3c) = 12 - 3a - 14 - 3b + 7 - 3c\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (12 - 14 + 7) + (-3a - 3b - 3c) = 5 - 3(a + b + c)\n\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[\n2a + 2b + 2c = 5 - 3(a + b + c)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This equation relates \\(2a + 2b + 2c\\) to \\(a + b + c\\). It might help if we can express \\(a + b + c\\) in terms of known quantities.\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...**\n- I realize I need another equation relating \\(a + b + c\\) to something solvable. Perhaps looking for a direct solution for \\(a + b + c\\) isn't straightforward here.\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Approaches**\n\n**Option 1: Substitute Variables**\n\nMaybe I can solve for one variable and substitute it back, but that seems like it might get messy with three equations.\n\n**Option 2: Elimination Method**\n\nI could try to eliminate variables one at a time to solve for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) individually.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Elimination Method** seems more systematic. Let's proceed with that to see if it leads us to a solution.\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Elimination Method**\n\nI'll try to eliminate one variable at a time to find relations between the others.\n\n#### **Eliminating \\(c\\)**\n\n**Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:**\n\n\\[\n(b + c) - (a + c) = (12 - 3a) - (-14 - 3b)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb - a = 12 - 3a + 14 + 3b\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb - a = 26 - 3a + 3b\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging:**\n\n\\[\nb - a - 3b + 3a = 26 \\Rightarrow 2a - 2b = 26 \\Rightarrow a - b = 13 \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **This simplifies nicely!** Now I have a direct relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n#### **Eliminating \\(b\\)**\n\n**Subtract Equation 3 from Equation 1:**\n\n\\[\n(b + c) - (a + b) = (12 - 3a) - (7 - 3c)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nc - a = 12 - 3a - 7 + 3c\n\\]\n\n\\[\nc - a = 5 - 3a + 3c\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging:**\n\n\\[\nc - a - 3c + 3a = 5 \\Rightarrow 2a - 2c = 5 \\Rightarrow a - c = 2.5 \\quad \\text{(Equation 5)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Now I have another direct relationship: \\(a - c = 2.5\\).\n\n#### **Summary of New Equations:**\n\n- **Equation 4:** \\(a - b = 13\\)\n- **Equation 5:** \\(a - c = 2.5\\)\n\n### **Step 4: Expressing \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) in Terms of Each Other**\n\n**From Equation 4:**\n\\[\na = b + 13\n\\]\n\n**From Equation 5:**\n\\[\na = c + 2.5\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- **Substitution could work here.** I can set these equal to each other since both equal \\(a\\).\n\n**Setting Equations Equal:**\n\n\\[\nb + 13 = c + 2.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb - c = 2.5 - 13 = -10.5 \\quad \\text{(Equation 6)}\n\\]\n\n### **Step 5: Expressing \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) in Terms of Each Other**\n\n**From Equation 6:**\n\\[\nb = c - 10.5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **This relationship is useful.** Now I can express \\(b\\) in terms of \\(c\\).\n\n### **Step 6: Substituting Back into Original Equations**\n\nI need to find \\(a + b + c\\), so let's see if we can substitute these relationships into one of the original equations.\n\n**Choosing Equation 1:**\n\\[\nb + c = 12 - 3a\n\\]\n\n**Substituting \\(a = b + 13\\):**\n\n\\[\nb + c = 12 - 3(b + 13)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb + c = 12 - 3b - 39\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb + c = -3b - 27\n\\]\n\n**Substituting \\(b = c - 10.5\\):**\n\n\\[\n(c - 10.5) + c = -3(c - 10.5) - 27\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2c - 10.5 = -3c + 31.5 - 27\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2c - 10.5 = -3c + 4.5\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging:**\n\n\\[\n2c + 3c = 4.5 + 10.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5c = 15 \\Rightarrow c = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait, this can't be right because...** Let's quickly check if this value makes sense.\n\n**Checking:**\n\\[\n5c = 15 \\Rightarrow c = 3\n\\]\n\nIf \\(c = 3\\), then from Equation 6:\n\\[\nb = 3 - 10.5 = -7.5\n\\]\n\nAnd from Equation 4:\n\\[\na = b + 13 = -7.5 + 13 = 5.5\n\\]\n\n**Checking with Original Equations:**\n\n1. \\(b + c = 12 - 3a\\)\n   \\[\n   -7.5 + 3 = -4.5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 12 - 3 \\times 5.5 = -4.5 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. \\(a + c = -14 - 3b\\)\n   \\[\n   5.5 + 3 = 8.5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -14 - 3 \\times (-7.5) = 8.5 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n   \\]\n   \n3. \\(a + b = 7 - 3c\\)\n   \\[\n   5.5 - 7.5 = -2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 7 - 3 \\times 3 = -2 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **All equations are satisfied.** So, \\(a = 5.5\\), \\(b = -7.5\\), and \\(c = 3\\) are indeed the correct solutions.\n\n### **Step 7: Calculating the Desired Expression**\n\nNow that we have values for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), let's compute \\(2a + 2b + 2c\\):\n\n\\[\n2a + 2b + 2c = 2(5.5) + 2(-7.5) + 2(3)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 11 + (-15) + 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 11 - 15 + 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 2\n\\]\n\n### **Check Your Work**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Does this make sense?** The numbers seem reasonable, and all original equations are satisfied.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**\n- **Is there another way to verify?** Perhaps I could have factored or added the equations differently to arrive at the same result. However, the elimination method worked well here.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Step-by-Step Approach:** Starting by adding all equations provided a relationship that led to meaningful substitutions.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Initially considered substitution and elimination methods; elimination proved effective.\n- **Reflecting and Checking:** Throughout the process, checking interim results ensured correctness.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe value of \\(2a + 2b + 2c\\) is **2**.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed, step-by-step exploration mirrors a human-like thought process, complete with brainstorming, strategy exploration, reflections, and checks along the way!",
