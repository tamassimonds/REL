I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to make sure I'm on the right track, check my work regularly, and be flexible enough to change my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's think through it like a human would, with all the natural thinking, doubts, and \"aha\" moments that come along the way.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem asks me to find \\(\\angle ABC\\) given the points \\(A = (-4, 0, 6)\\), \\(B = (-5, -1, 2)\\), and \\(C = (-6, -1, 3)\\). \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Understanding Angles in 3D:** I remember that angles in three-dimensional space can be tricky because they involve vectors and their relationships.\n- **Vector Approach:** Maybe I can use vectors to find the angle between them. This seems like a common method for 3D angle problems.\n- **Dot Product Method:** I recall that the dot product of two vectors can help find the cosine of the angle between them.\n- **Cross Product Alternative:** Another option is to use the cross product to find the sine of the angle.\n- **Check with Given Points:** Thinking about it, I need to form vectors from the given points. Perhaps vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{BC}\\) would be a good start.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes that make sense? Using vectors to find the angle between them seems appropriate since we're dealing with points in 3D space. Let me proceed with this idea and see where it leads.\n\n### **Step 1: Defining the Vectors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find \\(\\angle ABC\\), I need to look at the vectors that form this angle. Specifically, I think vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{BA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{BC}\\) would be relevant because the angle at \\(B\\) involves these two vectors.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Vector \\(\\overrightarrow{BA}\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\overrightarrow{BA} = A - B = (-4, 0, 6) - (-5, -1, 2) = (-4 + 5, 0 + 1, 6 - 2) = (1, 1, 4)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Vector \\(\\overrightarrow{BC}\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\overrightarrow{BC} = C - B = (-6, -1, 3) - (-5, -1, 2) = (-6 + 5, -1 + 1, 3 - 2) = (-1, 0, 1)\n  \\]\n  \n**Check:**\n\nWait, did I subtract correctly? Let me double-check:\n\nFor \\(\\overrightarrow{BA}\\):\n\n- \\(x\\): \\(-4 - (-5) = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(y\\): \\(0 - (-1) = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(z\\): \\(6 - 2 = 4\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor \\(\\overrightarrow{BC}\\):\n\n- \\(x\\): \\(-6 - (-5) = -1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(y\\): \\(-1 - (-1) = 0\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(z\\): \\(3 - 2 = 1\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything seems correct. Let's move on.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Dot Product**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to find the cosine of the angle between \\(\\overrightarrow{BA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{BC}\\). To do this, I'll use the dot product formula:\n\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{BA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BC} = |\\overrightarrow{BA}| \\times |\\overrightarrow{BC}| \\times \\cos(\\theta)\n\\]\n\nSo, I need to calculate the dot product \\(\\overrightarrow{BA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BC}\\) and the magnitudes \\(|\\overrightarrow{BA}|\\) and \\(|\\overrightarrow{BC}|\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Dot Product \\(\\overrightarrow{BA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BC}\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\overrightarrow{BA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BC} = (1)(-1) + (1)(0) + (4)(1) = -1 + 0 + 4 = 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Magnitude \\(|\\overrightarrow{BA}|\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  |\\overrightarrow{BA}| = \\sqrt{(1)^2 + (1)^2 + (4)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1 + 16} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Magnitude \\(|\\overrightarrow{BC}|\\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  |\\overrightarrow{BC}| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + (0)^2 + (1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 0 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, does \\(|\\overrightarrow{BA}| = 3\\sqrt{2}\\)? Let me double-check:\n\n\\[\n|\\overrightarrow{BA}| = \\sqrt{1 + 1 + 16} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nYes, that looks correct. The magnitudes make sense. Let's proceed.\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for Cosine of the Angle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I can plug these values into the dot product formula to solve for \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{BA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BC}}{|\\overrightarrow{BA}| \\times |\\overrightarrow{BC}|}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{3}{3\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3}{3 \\times 2} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, \\(\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\)? That corresponds to an angle of \\(60^\\circ\\). Does this make sense? Let me think about it:\n\nIn a 3D space, an angle of \\(60^\\circ\\) is plausible, especially since the vectors have components that aren't collinear or orthogonal. This seems reasonable.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWhile the math seems correct so far, I should verify if using the dot product method is the best approach. Could there be any mistakes or alternative methods that might yield the same result?\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nUsing the dot product is a standard method for finding angles between vectors in 3D space. The calculations for the dot product and magnitudes were straightforward, and the resulting \\(\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\) leading to a \\(60^\\circ\\) angle aligns with vector geometry principles.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe approach appears correct. The angle \\(\\angle ABC\\) is \\(60^\\circ\\). \n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's quickly recap the steps to ensure everything checks out:\n\n1. **Defined Vectors:** \\(\\overrightarrow{BA} = (1, 1, 4)\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{BC} = (-1, 0, 1)\\)\n2. **Calculated Dot Product:** \\(\\overrightarrow{BA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BC} = 3\\)\n3. **Computed Magnitudes:** \\(|\\overrightarrow{BA}| = 3\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(|\\overrightarrow{BC}| = \\sqrt{2}\\)\n4. **Solved for Cosine:** \\(\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n5. **Determined Angle:** \\(\\theta = 60^\\circ\\)\n\nEverything aligns. No discrepancies noted.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(\\angle ABC = 60^\\circ\\)\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem step by step, reflecting on each stage, and verifying calculations, I've confidently determined that the angle \\(\\angle ABC\\) is \\(60^\\circ\\).",
