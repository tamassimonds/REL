    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, check my work often, and reflect to ensure I'm on the right track. It's important to approach it as I would naturally think through a problem, including making mistakes and having those \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n- **Goal:** Sarah wants to fence a rectangular area containing **at least 100 sq. ft.**\n- The **length** should be **15 ft longer than the width.**\n- Need to use the **least amount of material** (minimize the perimeter).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- This seems like an **optimization problem** involving areas and perimeters of rectangles.\n- The **length-to-width relationship** introduces a constraint.\n- I remember something about minimizing perimeter for a given area, which might involve using calculus or algebraic manipulation.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Algebraic Approach:** Set up equations relating length and width, then solve for dimensions that meet the area requirement while minimizing the perimeter.\n2. **Calculus Method:** Use derivatives to find the minimum perimeter by considering length and width as variables.\n3. **Geometric Insight:** Since the problem involves minimizing perimeter for a given area, rectangles close to squares generally have the least perimeter. Maybe starting with that idea can help.\n4. **System of Equations:** Use given relationships to set up and solve for width and length.\n\nI think starting with the **Algebraic Approach** makes sense. Let's see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- We know that the **length \\( L \\) is 15 ft longer than the width \\( W \\).**\n- The **area \\( A \\) needs to be at least 100 sq. ft.**\n\n**Equations:**\n\n1. \\( L = W + 15 \\)\n2. \\( A = L \\times W \\geq 100 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems like a good starting point. By substituting \\( L \\) in terms of \\( W \\) into the area equation, I can express everything in terms of \\( W \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing Area in Terms of Width**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Substitute \\( L = W + 15 \\) into the area equation \\( A = L \\times W \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nA = (W + 15) \\times W = W^2 + 15W\n\\]\n\nSo, the area equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nW^2 + 15W \\geq 100\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow, I have a quadratic inequality in terms of \\( W \\). This is a good transformation because it allows me to find the minimum width that satisfies the area requirement.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense?\u00a0\n\n- **Yes:** The inequality \\( W^2 + 15W \\geq 100 \\) reflects the relationship between width and area, ensuring that the rectangle meets the area requirement based on the given length-to-width ratio.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Quadratic Inequality**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the minimum width \\( W \\), I need to solve the quadratic equation \\( W^2 + 15W = 100 \\).\n- This will give me the boundary point where the area is exactly 100 sq. ft.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nW^2 + 15W - 100 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, I'll use the **quadratic formula** to solve for \\( W \\):\n\n\\[\nW = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = 15 \\)\n- \\( c = -100 \\)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nW = \\frac{-15 \\pm \\sqrt{15^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-100)}}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nW = \\frac{-15 \\pm \\sqrt{225 + 400}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nW = \\frac{-15 \\pm \\sqrt{625}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nW = \\frac{-15 \\pm 25}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\n\\[\nW = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad W = \\frac{-40}{2} = -20\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Negative Width:** \\( W = -20 \\) doesn't make sense in this context. Width must be a positive value.\n- **Valid Solution:** \\( W = 5 \\) ft is the only feasible width.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Let me quickly verify if \\( W = 5 \\) satisfies the area requirement.\n\n\\[\nL = W + 15 = 5 + 15 = 20 \\text{ ft}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nA = L \\times W = 20 \\times 5 = 100 \\text{ sq. ft}\n\\]\n\n- **Does it meet the requirement?** Yes, exactly 100 sq. ft., which is the minimum required.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Minimizing the Perimeter**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I've found the minimum width \\( W = 5 \\) ft to satisfy the area requirement, I should check if this also minimizes the perimeter.\n- Given the problem constraints, it's likely that this width does minimize the perimeter, but let's confirm.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFirst, compute the **length \\( L \\)**:\n\n\\[\nL = W + 15 = 5 + 15 = 20 \\text{ ft}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the **perimeter \\( P \\)**:\n\n\\[\nP = 2L + 2W = 2(20) + 2(5) = 40 + 10 = 50 \\text{ ft}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Perimeter Check:** The perimeter is 50 ft with these dimensions.\n- **Does this seem minimal?** Considering the rectangle's dimensions are fixed by the area constraint and the length-to-width relationship, this should indeed be the minimum perimeter possible.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does this approach align with minimizing perimeter for a fixed area?** Yes, by ensuring the area is exactly 100 sq. ft. and maintaining the given length-to-width ratio, the perimeter is minimized.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- It's essential to double-check if all conditions of the problem are met with the solution obtained.\n- Ensure that the width is correct and that it leads to the desired area and minimal perimeter.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Width \\( W = 5 \\) ft:**\u00a0\n   - Positive and feasible.\n   \n2. **Length \\( L = 20 \\) ft:**\u00a0\n   - Derived correctly from the width.\n   \n3. **Area \\( A = 100 \\) sq. ft.:**\n   - Matches the requirement exactly.\n   \n4. **Perimeter \\( P = 50 \\) ft:**\u00a0\n   - Calculated based on \\( L \\) and \\( W \\).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **All conditions are satisfied:** The solution meets the area requirement and minimizes the perimeter under the given constraints.\n- **No alternative solutions:** The quadratic equation yielded a single positive solution for width, confirming it's the only valid answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Approach Worked Well:** Starting with setting up the relationship between length and width was effective.\n- **Quadratic Inequality Insight:** Solving for width through the area equation simplified the problem.\n- **Minimization Confirmation:** The derived dimensions ensure both area and perimeter are optimized according to the problem's requirements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Optimal Width:** **5 ft**\n- This width ensures the rectangular area is exactly 100 sq. ft. while using the least material for the fence, with a minimal perimeter of 50 ft.\n\n---\n\n**Reflection:**\u00a0Throughout the process, I checked each step to ensure the approach made sense. Initially brainstorming different strategies helped in choosing the most straightforward method. Regular checks confirmed that the solution was on track, and the final verification assured that all conditions were met. This step-by-step reflection ensured a thorough and correct solution.",

Distributing on the left-hand side, subtracting 100 from both sides, and factoring, we get \\begin{align*}\nw(w+15)&\\ge100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nw^2+15w-100&\\ge 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n(w-5)(w+20)&\\ge 0.\n\\end{align*} The roots are $w=5$ and $w=-20$.
