    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like I would if I were solving it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's see where this journey takes us!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**User Query:**  \nFind the second smallest positive integer that gives a remainder of \\(2\\) when divided by \\(3\\) and gives a remainder of \\(3\\) when divided by \\(7\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Modular Arithmetic:**  \n  This immediately reminds me of modular equations. I recall dealing with problems where numbers fit certain remainders based on different divisors. It feels like a classic **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)** type of problem.\n\n- **Lists and Patterns:**  \n  Another approach could be listing out numbers that satisfy each condition separately and see where they overlap. Maybe start with the smaller modulus to find candidates.\n\n- **Equations:**  \n  I could set up equations based on the remainders and solve them simultaneously. This might be straightforward, but I'm not sure if it'll be the most efficient method.\n\n- **Check for Uniqueness:**  \n  Wait, the problem asks for the **second** smallest integer. That hints that there might be multiple solutions, and I need to ensure I find the correct ones.\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**  \nHmm, I'm leaning towards using **modular arithmetic** or **listing numbers** to find common solutions. The CRT could be helpful, but let's see if a simpler method works first. If I get stuck, I'll reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Listing Candidates**\n\n**Step 1:**  \nList positive integers that give a remainder of \\(2\\) when divided by \\(3\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nOkay, let's start with the modulus that has the smaller range (\\(3\\)). This might help narrow down the possibilities.\n\n**Calculations:**  \nNumbers satisfying \\(n \\equiv 2 \\mod 3\\):  \n\\(2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, \\ldots\\)  \n(Adding \\(3\\) each time starting from \\(2\\))\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems like a good starting point. Now, I need to see which of these also satisfy the second condition.\n\n**Strategy 2: Check Divisibility by \\(7\\)**\n\n**Step 2:**  \nFrom the list above, find numbers that give a remainder of \\(3\\) when divided by \\(7\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI need to check each number from my list against the second condition. This feels a bit manual, but let's proceed.\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- \\(2 \\mod 7 = 2\\) (Doesn't satisfy)\n- \\(5 \\mod 7 = 5\\) (Doesn't satisfy)\n- \\(8 \\mod 7 = 1\\) (Doesn't satisfy)\n- \\(11 \\mod 7 = 4\\) (Doesn't satisfy)\n- \\(14 \\mod 7 = 0\\) (Doesn't satisfy)\n- \\(17 \\mod 7 = 3\\) (Satisfies both conditions)\n\nFindings so far:  \nOnly \\(17\\) satisfies both conditions.\n\n**Checking the Solution:**  \nWait, I need the **second** smallest integer, so \\(17\\) is the **first** solution. I must continue searching for the next valid number.\n\n---\n\n### **Continuing the Search**\n\n**Strategy 1 (Continued):**  \nContinue the list of candidates beyond \\(17\\) and check for the second solution.\n\n**Step 3:**  \nContinue listing numbers that give a remainder of \\(2\\) when divided by \\(3\\):  \n\\(20, 23, 26, 29, \\ldots\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet's see which of these also satisfies the condition for \\(7\\).\n\n**Strategy 2 (Continued):**  \nCheck each number against the second condition.\n\n**Step 4:**  \nFrom the extended list, find numbers that give a remainder of \\(3\\) when divided by \\(7\\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- \\(20 \\mod 7 = 6\\) (Doesn't satisfy)\n- \\(23 \\mod 7 = 2\\) (Doesn't satisfy)\n- \\(26 \\mod 7 = 5\\) (Doesn't satisfy)\n- \\(29 \\mod 7 = 1\\) (Doesn't satisfy)\n- \\(32 \\mod 7 = 4\\) (Doesn't satisfy)\n- \\(35 \\mod 7 = 0\\) (Doesn't satisfy)\n- \\(38 \\mod 7 = 3\\) (Satisfies both conditions)\n\n**Findings:**  \nThe second solution is \\(38\\).\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, let me double-check. Does \\(38\\) satisfy both conditions?  \n- \\(38 \\div 3 = 12\\) with a remainder of \\(2\\) \u2714\ufe0f  \n- \\(38 \\div 7 = 5\\) with a remainder of \\(3\\) \u2714\ufe0f  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nYes, \\(38\\) works. So, the second smallest positive integer that satisfies both conditions is **38**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- **First Solution:** \\(17\\)  \n  - \\(17 \\div 3 = 5\\) remainder \\(2\\) \u2714\ufe0f  \n  - \\(17 \\div 7 = 2\\) remainder \\(3\\) \u2714\ufe0f  \n- **Second Solution:** \\(38\\)  \n  - \\(38 \\div 3 = 12\\) remainder \\(2\\) \u2714\ufe0f  \n  - \\(38 \\div 7 = 5\\) remainder \\(3\\) \u2714\ufe0f  \n\n**Validation:**  \nBoth \\(17\\) and \\(38\\) satisfy the given conditions. The approach of listing candidates and checking against both modulus conditions worked well here.\n\n**Alternative Strategy Consideration:**  \nInitially, I thought about using the **Chinese Remainder Theorem**, but since the numbers involved were relatively small, listing was straightforward and effective. CRT might have been overkill for this problem.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nIt's always good to start with a simple method and see if it works. If not, exploring more advanced techniques like CRT is a valid next step. Checking each solution carefully ensures accuracy, especially when multiple solutions are involved.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe second smallest positive integer that gives a remainder of \\(2\\) when divided by \\(3\\) and a remainder of \\(3\\) when divided by \\(7\\) is **38**.\n\nI hope this step-by-step approach, complete with brainstorming, reflection, and checking, provides a clear understanding of how to tackle such problems.",

  "ground_truth": "We start by taking $3$ and adding multiples of $7$ until we see an integer that gives a remainder of $2$ when divided by $3$. We find that $3$ and $10$ do not, but $17$ does. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the other integers which leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 and a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 differ from 17 by a multiple of $3\\cdot7=21$. Thus the next one is $17+21=\\boxed{38}$."
