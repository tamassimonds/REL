    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it as naturally as possible, just like if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work as I go to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the question, I see that Sharon bought a mixture of nuts\u2014pecans, walnuts, and cashews\u2014in a ratio of **2:3:1** by weight. There's a total of **9 pounds** of nuts, and I need to find out how many pounds of **walnuts** are in the mixture.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Proportions and Ratios:** This reminds me of problems involving breaking down total weights into different parts based on given ratios. I think I've seen similar questions where you need to calculate individual weights from a total based on ratios.\n  \n- **Total Parts Calculation:** The first thing that comes to mind is to determine how many \"parts\" the total weight is divided into according to the ratio. Each type of nut corresponds to a specific number of parts.\n\n- **Direct Multiplication:** Another thought is to multiply the ratio by a common factor to find the actual weights, but I'm not sure yet if I should go that route initially.\n\n- **Checking for Whole Number Solutions:** Given the total weight is 9 pounds, I'm wondering if each part in the ratio corresponds to a whole number weight. That might simplify things.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Parts:** Add up the parts in the ratio (2 + 3 + 1 = 6) to see what fraction of the total each nut represents.\n   \n2. **Determine Weight per Part:** Divide the total weight by the number of parts to find the weight represented by each part.\n\n3. **Calculate Individual Weights:** Multiply the weight per part by the number of parts for each nut type to get their respective weights.\n\n4. **Verification:** After calculating, verify if the sum of the individual weights equals the total (9 pounds) to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Total Parts in the Ratio**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I know that the ratio is **2:3:1**, which corresponds to pecans, walnuts, and cashews, respectively.\n  \n- To find out how many total parts there are, I need to add the parts together.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Parts} = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- That makes sense. The total parts are **6**, so each part represents \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of the total weight.\n\n- **Quick Check:** If each part is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) of 9 pounds, then \\(\\frac{9}{6} = 1.5\\) pounds per part. That seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determine Weight per Part**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I know there are 6 parts in total, I can find out how much each part weighs by dividing the total weight by the number of parts.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weight per Part} = \\frac{9 \\text{ pounds}}{6} = 1.5 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This means each part weighs **1.5 pounds**. \n\n- **Check:** Wait, does multiplying 1.5 by the total parts give me 9 pounds? Yes, \\(1.5 \\times 6 = 9\\), so this checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate Weight of Walnuts**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since walnuts are represented by **3 parts** in the ratio, I need to multiply the weight per part by the number of parts for walnuts.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weight of Walnuts} = 3 \\times 1.5 \\text{ pounds} = 4.5 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- So, there are **4.5 pounds** of walnuts in the mixture.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Let me see if this makes sense relative to the other nuts. \n\n  - Pecans: \\(2 \\times 1.5 = 3\\) pounds\n  - Walnuts: 4.5 pounds\n  - Cashews: \\(1 \\times 1.5 = 1.5\\) pounds\n  \n  - Adding them up: \\(3 + 4.5 + 1.5 = 9\\) pounds, which matches the total.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The calculation seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verification of Total Weight**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To ensure everything is accurate, I should check if the sum of all individual weights equals the total weight of the mixture.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ pounds (pecans)} + 4.5 \\text{ pounds (walnuts)} + 1.5 \\text{ pounds (cashews)} = 9 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The sum is indeed **9 pounds**, which matches the given total weight.\n\n- **Final Check:** This confirms that the ratios and calculations are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy**\n\n**Wait, perhaps there's another way to confirm this.**\n\n- **Proportions Method:** Instead of calculating the weight per part directly, I could also set up proportions based on the total weight and each nut's parts in the ratio.\n\n**Alternative Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weight of Walnuts} = \\frac{3}{6} \\times 9 \\text{ pounds} = 4.5 \\text{ pounds}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Comparison:** This alternative method also gives **4.5 pounds** for walnuts, which matches our previous calculation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Both strategies lead to the same result, confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Multiple Approaches:** It's beneficial to explore different strategies to ensure accuracy, especially when the initial method seems straightforward.\n\n- **Verification Is Key:** Always checking the sum of individual weights against the total helps catch any potential mistakes early.\n\n- **Consistency Check:** Using alternative methods that arrive at the same answer bolsters confidence in the solution's correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully walking through the problem and exploring different strategies, I've determined that there are **4.5 pounds** of walnuts in Sharon's mixture. By calculating the weight per part based on the given ratio and verifying the total, I've ensured the accuracy of the solution.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step approach, complete with brainstorming, reflections, and checks, provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of how to tackle such ratio-based problems.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the pecan to walnut to cashew ratio is $2:3:1$, it follows that the walnut ratio to all of the nuts is equal to $\\frac{3}{2+3+1} = \\frac 12$. Thus, there were $\\frac 12\\times 9 = \\boxed{4.5}$ pounds of walnuts in the mixture."
