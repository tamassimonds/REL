    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's dive into this problem as if we're tackling it in real-time, reflecting, brainstorming, and checking our work along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, **\"Emily ordered her playing cards by suit in the order \\( A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A, 2, 3, \\cdots \\). What is the 42nd card?\"**, several initial thoughts come to mind:\n\n- **Sequence Repetition:** It seems like a repeating sequence with ranks \\( A, 2, 3, \\ldots, K \\). But how often does it repeat?\n- **Length of the Sequence:** I vaguely remember a standard deck having 13 ranks, so maybe the sequence repeats every 13 positions?\n- **Modulus Operations:** This kind of problem feels like it might involve modular arithmetic, something like figuring out positions in a repeating cycle.\n- **Need for Confirmation:** I'm not entirely sure yet, so I should explore these ideas before committing to one.\n\nLet me brainstorm a bit more:\n\n- If the sequence repeats every 13 cards, then to find the 42nd card, I would need to see where 42 fits in this cycle.\n- Alternatively, maybe there's another pattern or detail I'm missing.\n\n**Wait a moment\u2014** I think the repeating part is spot on, but let me explore it further to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Count the Sequence Repetitions**\n\n1. **Counting Steps:**\n   - If the sequence is 13 cards long, I can divide 42 by 13 to see how many complete cycles fit and where the remainder lands.\n   \n   \\[\n   42 \\div 13 = 3 \\text{ cycles with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   \n   So, after 3 complete cycles (which account for 39 cards), the 42nd card is the 3rd card in the next cycle.\n\n2. **Identifying the 3rd Card:**\n   - Referring back to the sequence: \\( A, 2, 3, \\ldots \\), the 3rd card is **3**.\n\n**Hmm, let me double-check this approach.** Does it make sense? Yes, dividing by 13 gives me the number of complete sequences, and the remainder tells me the position within the next sequence.\n\n**Reflection:** This seems reasonable, but I want to verify with another method to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 2: Listing Out the Sequence**\n\n**Idea:** Write out the sequence step by step to see the pattern and confirm the position of the 42nd card.\n\n1. **Writing the Sequence:**\n   - Let\u2019s list the cards one cycle at a time:\n     - Cycle 1: \\( A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K \\) (13 cards)\n     - Cycle 2: \\( A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K \\) (13 cards)\n     - Cycle 3: \\( A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K \\) (13 cards)\n     - **Total So Far:** 39 cards\n\n2. **Positioning the 42nd Card:**\n   - The 42nd card falls in the 4th cycle, specifically the **3rd card**.\n\n3. **Checking the 4th Cycle:**\n   - Cycle 4: \\( A, 2, 3, \\ldots \\)\n   - The 3rd card is **3**.\n\n**Hmm, this matches the previous method.** So, both strategies converge to the same answer.\n\n**Checking Work:** Both methods indicate that the 42nd card is **3**, which is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring two different strategies\u2014**dividing to find the cycle position** and **listing out the sequence step by step**\u2014both lead to the same conclusion: the **42nd card is 3**.\n\n- **Strategy Verification:** Dividing by 13 confirmed the cycle's effect, and listing the sequence ensured accuracy in positioning.\n- **Consistency Check:** Both methods align, so I'm confident in the answer.\n\n**Final Answer:** The **42nd card** in Emily's sequence is **3**.\n\n**Wait, let me double-check the calculation:**\n\n- **Division:** \\( 42 \\div 13 = 3 \\) with a remainder of \\( 3 \\times 13 + 3 = 39 + 3 = 42 \\)\n- **Listing:** Clearly, the 42nd position matches the 3rd card in the cycle.\n\nEverything checks out. **Conclusion:** The **3rd card** in the sequence is **3**, so the **42nd card** is also **3**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by identifying that the sequence repeats every 13 cards.\n- **Strategy Exploration:** Used division to find the cycle position and then verified by listing the sequence.\n- **Reflection:** Checked each method to ensure consistency and correctness.\n- **Final Check:** Confirmed the position aligns with both approaches, solidifying the answer.\n\nBy thinking through it step by step, exploring different strategies, and continuously checking the work, we confidently determine that the **42nd card** is **3**.",
