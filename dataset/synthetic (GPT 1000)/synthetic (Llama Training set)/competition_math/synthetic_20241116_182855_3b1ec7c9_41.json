I remember that absolute value equations can have different cases based on the definition of absolute value. Since it's given that \\( x < 2 \\), that might help narrow things down.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to connect \\( |x - 2| = p \\) directly to \\( x - p \\) without doing a bit more digging. Let me brainstorm and see where this leads.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Reflect on Absolute Value Definition:**\n   - I know \\( |x - 2| \\) represents the distance between \\( x \\) and 2 on the number line. Since \\( x < 2 \\), this distance is \\( 2 - x \\).\n   \n2. **Substitute \\( p \\) with \\( 2 - x \\):**\n   - Thinking that if \\( |x - 2| = p \\) and \\( x < 2 \\), then maybe \\( p = 2 - x \\). This substitution might help relate \\( x \\) and \\( p \\) directly.\n   \n3. **Rearrange to Find \\( x - p \\):**\n   - After substituting, look for an expression that gives \\( x - p \\) in terms of \\( p \\).\n\n4. **Alternative Approaches:**\n   - Maybe consider writing \\( x \\) in terms of \\( p \\) and then find \\( x - p \\).\n   - Or check if there's a need to use quadratic expressions or other algebraic manipulations, but that seems overcomplicated for an absolute value problem.\n\nLet me start with the first idea\u2014substituting \\( p \\) with \\( 2 - x \\)\u2014and see where it leads.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Absolute Value Definition**\n\nFrom the definition of absolute value:\n\n\\[\n|x - 2| = \n\\begin{cases} \n2 - x & \\text{if } x < 2 \\\\\nx - 2 & \\text{if } x \\geq 2 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( x < 2 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n|x - 2| = 2 - x\n\\]\n\nSince \\( |x - 2| = p \\), we can substitute:\n\n\\[\np = 2 - x\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection After Step 1**\n\nHmm, this makes sense because if \\( x < 2 \\), then the absolute value \\( |x - 2| \\) is indeed \\( 2 - x \\). So, \\( p = 2 - x \\). \n\nThis seems like a solid starting point. But let's proceed to see if it naturally leads us to \\( x - p \\).\n\n### **Step 2: Express \\( x \\) in Terms of \\( p \\)**\n\nFrom the equation \\( p = 2 - x \\), I want to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 2 - p\n\\]\n\n### **Checkpoint: Is This Correct?**\n\nLet's quickly check if this makes sense.\n\n- If \\( p = 2 - x \\), then rearranging gives \\( x = 2 - p \\).\n- This feels correct because substituting back would satisfy the original absolute value equation.\n\n### **Step 3: Find \\( x - p \\)**\n\nNow, I need to find \\( x - p \\) in terms of \\( p \\):\n\n\\[\nx - p = (2 - p) - p\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[\nx - p = 2 - p - p = 2 - 2p\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection After Step 3**\n\nWait a second, let me double-check this. \n\n- Starting with \\( x = 2 - p \\), subtracting \\( p \\) seems straightforward.\n- The math checks out: \\( 2 - p - p = 2 - 2p \\).\n\nOkay, this looks correct. \\( x - p = 2 - 2p \\).\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Result**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's verify if this result aligns with the original equation \\( |x - 2| = p \\).\n\nIf \\( x - p = 2 - 2p \\), let's see if substituting back maintains the equality.\n\n1. Recall \\( x = 2 - p \\).\n2. So, \\( x - p = 2 - p - p = 2 - 2p \\).\n\nThis matches the result we derived. Therefore, the solution is consistent.\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Checking by Substituting Values**\n\nTo ensure the correctness, let's test with a specific value:\n\n- Suppose \\( p = 1 \\).\n- According to our formula: \\( x - 1 = 2 - 2(1) = 0 \\), so \\( x = 1 \\).\n- Check: \\( |1 - 2| = | -1 | = 1 = p \\). Everything aligns.\n\nThis quick check confirms that the solution is correct.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\nx - p = 2 - 2p\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nSo, by exploring different strategies\u2014starting with the definition of absolute value and solving step by step\u2014I arrived at \\( x - p = 2 - 2p \\). Throughout the process, I reflected regularly to ensure each step made sense and verified the final result to confirm its correctness. This approach not only led to the correct answer but also ensured that each part of the solution was logically consistent.",
