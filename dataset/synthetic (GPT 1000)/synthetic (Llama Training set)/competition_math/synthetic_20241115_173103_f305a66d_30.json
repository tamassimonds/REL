    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right path.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the question:\n\n**\"What is left when \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) is subtracted from \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)?\"**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This seems like a straightforward fraction subtraction problem. I've dealt with these before, but it's always good to double-check and think through the different ways to approach it.\n\n- **Similar Past Problems:** It reminds me of when I had to subtract fractions with different denominators. I remember that finding a common denominator was key back then.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Find a Common Denominator:** Bring both fractions to have the same denominator before subtracting.\n  2. **Convert to Decimals:** Perhaps convert both fractions to decimals, perform the subtraction, and then convert back if needed.\n  3. **Subtract Numerators Directly:** Attempt to subtract the numerators directly, assuming the denominators align, but that won't work here since they differ.\n\n- **Thinking:** Given that the denominators are different (\\(8\\) and \\(4\\)), I think finding a common denominator is the most straightforward approach. Let me start there.\n\n### **Step 1: Find a Common Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Objective:** Make sure both fractions have the same denominator so they can be easily subtracted.\n  \n- **Exploring Options:** The denominators are \\(8\\) and \\(4\\). I recall that multiplying \\(4\\) by \\(2\\) gives \\(8\\), so perhaps I can convert \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) to have a denominator of \\(8\\).\n\n- **Action:** Let's convert \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of \\(8\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{4 \\times 2} = \\frac{6}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Wait, that seems right because multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number keeps the value equivalent.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Now both fractions are \\( \\frac{6}{8} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), so they have a common denominator.\n\n### **Step 2: Subtract the Numerators**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Objective:** With a common denominator, I can now subtract the numerators directly.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:** I could write it out as \\( \\frac{6 - 1}{8} \\). Let me do that.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{8} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6 - 1}{8} = \\frac{5}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Hmm, \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) seems like a reasonable result. Let me think for a moment\u2014subtracting one part from six parts leaves five parts over the same denominator.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The answer makes sense so far, but I want to ensure everything is correct before finalizing.\n\n### **Step 3: Verify the Result**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Objective:** Double-check the subtraction to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n- **Exploring Options:** Perhaps I can think of it in terms of whole parts. \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) is three-eighths away from one whole, and subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) should leave me with five-eighths.\n\n- **Check:** Let me see\u2014if \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) is \\( \\frac{6}{8} \\), and I subtract \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), that indeed leaves \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{8} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{5}{8}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** That number seems too big for the context, but based on the calculations, it's correct. Let me think\u2014subtraction was done correctly with common denominators.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The result \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) is correct.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Convert to Decimals**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Objective:** To see if converting fractions to decimals and then subtracting yields the same result.\n\n- **Exploring Options:** Perhaps converting \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) to \\(0.75\\) and \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) to \\(0.125\\), then subtracting them could verify our earlier result.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n0.75 - 0.125 = 0.625\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Wait a minute, \\(0.625\\) as a fraction is \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\). This confirms our earlier result.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Using decimals also leads to the same answer, \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\).\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Checking:** Both methods\u2014finding a common denominator and converting to decimals\u2014yield the same result: \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\). This consistency assures me that the solution is correct.\n\n- **Mistakes:** At first, I considered subtracting the numerators directly without finding a common denominator, but that would have led to an incorrect approach. Recognizing the need for a common denominator was crucial.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Throughout the process, by brainstorming different strategies, checking each step, and reflecting on the correctness of my approach, I've confidently arrived at the answer: **\\( \\frac{5}{8} \\)**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nWhen \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) is subtracted from \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), **\\( \\frac{5}{8} \\)** is left.",

  "ground_truth": "We are looking for $\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{8}$. The least common denominator is 8, so we must rewrite $\\frac{3}{4}$ with 8 in the denominator.   $\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2}{2} = \\frac{6}{8}$.   Then, we know that $\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6}{8} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6-1}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{8}}$."
