    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. Just like tackling any real-world issue, I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting frequently, checking my work along the way, and being open to changing my approach if something isn't working.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, _\"How many four-digit positive integers have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3?\"_, I think:\n\n- **Understanding the Range:** We're dealing with four-digit numbers, so the smallest is 1000 and the largest is 9999.\n  \n- **Digits Involved:** Each digit place can range from 0 to 9, except the first digit, which cannot be 0.\n\n- **Inclusion of Specific Digits:** The problem specifies that at least one digit must be a 2 or a 3.\n\nInitial Reaction:\n- _\"Hmm, this looks like a combinatorial problem involving digits. Maybe I can count the total number of four-digit integers and then subtract those that don\u2019t have a 2 or a 3.\"_\n  \n- _\"Or perhaps I can directly calculate the numbers that have at least one 2 or 3.\"_\n\nThis reminds me of problems where we use complementary counting or direct enumeration of cases.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Complementary Counting:**\n   - **Idea:** Count all four-digit numbers and subtract those without any 2s or 3s.\n   - **Pros:** It might be easier to calculate the total number and exclude the unwanted cases rather than counting directly.\n   - **Cons:** Need to ensure all cases are covered without double counting.\n\n2. **Direct Enumeration:**\n   - **Idea:** Count all four-digit numbers that have at least one 2 or 3.\n   - **Pros:** More straightforward since we're directly targeting the desired cases.\n   - **Cons:** Might involve complex multi-case calculations.\n\n3. **Digit Position Analysis:**\n   - **Idea:** Analyze each digit position separately to see how placing a 2 or 3 affects the total.\n   - **Pros:** Could provide a detailed insight into the contribution of each position.\n   - **Cons:** Risk of overcomplicating the problem by considering too many overlapping cases.\n\nReflection:\n- _\"The complementary counting method seems more efficient. By calculating the total and subtracting the undesired cases, I can avoid the complexity of directly enumerating all valid numbers.\"_\n\n- _\"However, to ensure accuracy, I'll need to verify that no cases are missed or overcounted.\"_\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Four-Digit Integers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since we're dealing with four-digit numbers, the first digit can be anything from 1 to 9 (9 options), and each of the remaining three digits can be from 0 to 9 (10 options each).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Total four-digit integers} = 9 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 9,000 \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- _\"That seems reasonable because all digit positions have valid options. The multiplication checks out.\"_\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Number of Four-Digit Integers Without Any 2 or 3**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To use complementary counting, I need to know how many four-digit numbers **do not** have 2 or 3 in any digit.\n\n- **First Digit:** Can be 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (7 options).\n\n- **Subsequent Digits:** Can be 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (8 options each).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Number without 2 or 3} = 7 \\times 8 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 7 \\times 512 = 3,584 \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- _\"Wait, let me double-check the digit options. For the first digit, excluding 0, 2, and 3, there are indeed 7 possible digits. The subsequent positions each have 8 options excluding 2 and 3.\"_\n  \n- _\"The multiplication makes sense. 7 times 8 cubed seems correct.\"_\n\n- _\"So, 3,584 numbers don't have any 2s or 3s.\"_\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Desired Number of Four-Digit Integers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The number of four-digit integers with **at least one** 2 or 3 is the total number minus those without any 2s or 3s.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Desired number} = 9,000 - 3,584 = 5,416 \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- _\"Let me verify this.\"_\n  \n- _\"Total four-digit numbers: 9,000.\"_\n  \n- _\"Numbers without 2 or 3: 3,584.\"_\n  \n- _\"Subtracting gives 5,416, which seems plausible.\"_\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Final Check**\n\n- **Quick Check:** The number 5,416 isn't overly large compared to the total (9,000), which makes sense given that having at least one 2 or 3 is a common occurrence in four-digit numbers.\n\n- **Deeper Reflection:** By subtracting the cases without 2s or 3s from the total, I've accounted for all numbers that have at least one 2 or 3, ensuring that no overlapping cases are missed.\n\n- **Alternate Strategy Verification:** If I had chosen to use direct enumeration, I would have needed to consider multiple cases overlapping (e.g., numbers with both 2s and 3s), which might have complicated the calculations and increased the risk of miscounting.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The complementary counting method is effective here, providing a straightforward solution. The calculated number, 5,416, aligns logically with the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Total Number of Four-Digit Positive Integers with At Least One Digit That Is a 2 or a 3:**\n\\[ \n\\boxed{5,416} \n\\]\n\n---\n\nThroughout this process, I started with brainstorming different strategies, reflected on which would be most efficient, and carefully checked each step to ensure accuracy. By approaching the problem methodically and being open to adjusting my strategy, I arrived at a reliable solution.",

  "ground_truth": "There are 9000 four-digit positive integers. For those without a 2 or 3, the first digit could be one of the seven numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and each of the other digits could be one of the eight numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So there are \\[\n9000- 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8\\cdot 8=\\boxed{5416}\n\\] four-digit numbers  with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3."
