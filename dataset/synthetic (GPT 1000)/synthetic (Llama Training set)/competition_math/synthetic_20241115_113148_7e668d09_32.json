    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed. I\u2019ll treat this like a real human problem-solving session, complete with initial confusion, brainstorming, possible missteps, and \u201caha moments.\u201d\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, **Amy, Betty, Cathy, and Daisy together have 36 apples** to split among themselves in the ratio **2:3:3:4**. The question asks for the combined number of apples **Betty and Cathy** will have.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Ratios and Proportions:** This immediately makes me think about ratios and how to divide a total amount based on given proportions. It reminds me of problems where you need to break down a total into parts according to specific shares.\n\n- **Handling Multiple People:** Since there are four people involved, I hope the ratio adds up neatly to 1 (or 100%) so I can work with percentages or fractions easily.\n\n- **Total Apples:** Having a total of 36 apples is a manageable number for calculations, which is reassuring.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Add the Ratios Together:** First, find the total parts in the ratio to understand what fraction each person gets of the total apples.\n\n2. **Calculate Individual Shares:** Once I have the total parts, divide the total apples by this number to find out how many apples each part represents.\n\n3. **Multiply by Each Person\u2019s Share:** Multiply the number of apples per part by each person's part of the ratio to find out how many apples each person gets.\n\n4. **Sum Betty and Cathy\u2019s Apples:** Finally, add Betty and Cathy\u2019s shares together to get the desired total.\n\n**Possible Challenges:**\n\n- **Ratios Not Adding Up Correctly:** I need to make sure that the sum of the ratios equals a whole number multiple of 36; otherwise, the individual shares won\u2019t be whole apples.\n\n- **Managing Multiple Steps:** Keeping track of each step is crucial to avoid calculation mistakes, especially with multiple people involved.\n\n### **Step 1: Add the Ratios Together**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s start by adding up the parts of the ratio to see how many total parts there are.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Amy: 2 parts\n- Betty: 3 parts\n- Cathy: 3 parts\n- Daisy: 4 parts\n\nTotal parts = \\(2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 12\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** The total number of parts is **12**, which is a neat number. This makes me think that each part can be a whole apple when I divide the total apples (36) by 12.\n\n- **Is This Correct?** It seems reasonable because the ratio parts add up to 12, which divides evenly into 36.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Value of Each Part**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to determine how many apples each part represents.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Total apples = 36\n- Total parts = 12\n\nValue of each part = \\( \\frac{36}{12} = 3 \\) apples per part\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Each part being 3 apples seems logical because 36 divided by 12 is an exact whole number.\n\n- **Check:** If each part is 3 apples, then multiplying by the number of parts for each person should give whole numbers.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate Individual Shares**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI\u2019ll multiply the number of apples per part by each person\u2019s ratio parts to find out how many apples they get.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Amy: \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) apples\n- Betty: \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) apples\n- Cathy: \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) apples\n- Daisy: \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) apples\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Adding these up should equal the total apples (36):\n  \\(6 + 9 + 9 + 12 = 36\\)\n\n- **Is It Correct?** Yes, the numbers add up correctly, which reassures me that the calculations are on the right track.\n\n### **Step 4: Sum Betty and Cathy\u2019s Apples**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFinally, I need to add Betty and Cathy\u2019s shares together to find the total number of apples they have collectively.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Betty: 9 apples\n- Cathy: 9 apples\n\nTogether, Betty and Cathy have \\(9 + 9 = 18\\) apples.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Match Expectations?** Given the ratios, it makes sense that Betty and Cathy together would have more apples than Amy but less than Daisy since their ratios are 3 and 4 parts, respectively.\n\n- **Check:** Let\u2019s do a quick check:\n  - Betty and Cathy together should have \\( \\frac{3}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the total apples.\n  - Half of 36 apples is 18, which matches our calculation.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Total Apples Calculated:** \\(6 + 9 + 9 + 12 = 36\\)\n- **Betty and Cathy Together:** \\(9 + 9 = 18\\)\n- **Proportion Check:** Half of 36 apples is 18, aligning with the ratio calculations.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nEverything checks out. The approach was straightforward: determine the value of each part in the ratio, calculate individual shares, and sum Betty and Cathy\u2019s apples. The numbers add up consistently, and proportional checks confirm the validity of the solution.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Betty and Cathy together have **18** apples.**\n\nBy adding their respective shares from the total divided according to the given ratio, we arrive at a consistent and correct total. The step-by-step approach, with continuous checking and reflection, ensured accuracy throughout the process.",

  "ground_truth": "The four girls are dividing the $36$ apples into $2+3+3+4 = 12$ equal parts. Thus, there are $\\frac{36}{12} = 3$ apples per part. Together, Betty and Cathy have $3+3 = 6$ parts, so they will have $3 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{18}$ apples."
