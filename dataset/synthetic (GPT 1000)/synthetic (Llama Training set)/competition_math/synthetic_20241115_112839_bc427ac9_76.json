    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through as naturally as possible. I'll start by brainstorming how to approach it, checking my work frequently, and being open to changing strategies if something doesn't seem right. Let's make this as human-like as possible, with all the messy thoughts and reflections included.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**User's Query:**\nAlan saved $500 in a bank account that compounds 3% annually. After 10 years, how much is in Alan's bank account? (Round to the nearest dollar.)\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Initial Reaction:** Okay, this involves compound interest, which I've seen before. Compound interest means the money grows by a percentage each year, and that growth itself earns more interest in subsequent years.\n  \n- **Reminders:** I remember there's a formula for compound interest:  \n  \\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \\]  \n  Where:\n  - \\( A \\) is the amount after time \\( n \\),\n  - \\( P \\) is the principal amount (initial money),\n  - \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),\n  - \\( n \\) is the number of years.\n\n- **Alternative Ideas:** Maybe I could calculate it year by year to see how it grows, or perhaps there's a simpler method I could use by understanding the compounding effect better.\n\n- **Checking if I Recall Correctly:** Does this formula make sense? Yes, because it accounts for the interest being applied to both the principal and the accumulated interest from previous years.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nUsing the formula seems like the most straightforward approach. But to be thorough, I could also consider calculating it year by year to see if the formula holds up.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Compound Interest Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's start by plugging the numbers into the compound interest formula to see what we get.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 500 \\)\n- \\( r = 3\\% = 0.03 \\)\n- \\( n = 10 \\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nA = 500 \\times (1 + 0.03)^{10}\n\\]\n\\[\nA = 500 \\times (1.03)^{10}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( (1.03)^{10} \\).\n\n\\[\n(1.03)^{10} \\approx 1.3439 \\quad \\text{(using a calculator)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nA = 500 \\times 1.3439 \\approx 671.95\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**  \n- **Quick Check:** Wait, does \\$671.95 seem reasonable after 10 years with 3% compounding? Let's see.\n  \n  - Yearly growth at 3% on \\$500 would add \\$15 each year initially. Over 10 years, the total would be \\$150, not accounting for the compounding effect. So \\$671.95 being higher makes sense because the interest is compounded.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe amount \\$671.95 seems plausible. However, to be sure, let's compare this with a year-by-year calculation to see if the formula is correct.\n\n### **Step 2: Year-by-Year Calculation for Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nCalculating the amount year by year can help verify if the compound interest formula is being applied correctly. It might take longer, but it's a good check.\n\n**Calculation:**\nLet's compute the amount at the end of each year:\n\n- **Year 1:**  \n  \\[\n  500 \\times 1.03 = 515.00\n  \\]\n  \n- **Year 2:**  \n  \\[\n  515.00 \\times 1.03 = 530.45\n  \\]\n  \n- **Year 3:**  \n  \\[\n  530.45 \\times 1.03 = 546.36\n  \\]\n  \n- **Year 4:**  \n  \\[\n  546.36 \\times 1.03 = 562.74\n  \\]\n  \n- **Year 5:**  \n  \\[\n  562.74 \\times 1.03 = 579.68\n  \\]\n  \n- **Year 6:**  \n  \\[\n  579.68 \\times 1.03 = 597.11\n  \\]\n  \n- **Year 7:**  \n  \\[\n  597.11 \\times 1.03 = 615.08\n  \\]\n  \n- **Year 8:**  \n  \\[\n  615.08 \\times 1.03 = 633.57\n  \\]\n  \n- **Year 9:**  \n  \\[\n  633.57 \\times 1.03 = 652.58\n  \\]\n  \n- **Year 10:**  \n  \\[\n  652.58 \\times 1.03 = 672.12\n  \\]\n\n**Total After 10 Years:**  \n\\[ \nA \\approx 672.12 \n\\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**  \n- **Comparison:** The year-by-year calculation gives \\$672.12, while the formula method gave \\$671.95. The difference is only about \\$0.17, which could be due to rounding in the exponentiation step.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth methods are very close, confirming that the compound interest formula was applied correctly. The slight difference can be attributed to rounding during calculations.\n\n### **Step 3: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince both methods provide consistent results, I can confidently conclude that the amount after 10 years is approximately \\$672. For final presentation, we'll round to the nearest dollar as requested.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{672}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Strategy Effectiveness:** Starting with the compound interest formula was effective, and verifying it with a year-by-year calculation reassured me that the formula works correctly.\n- **Mistakes and Adjustments:** Initially, I considered calculating manually year by year from the beginning but opted for the formula to save time. Checking both methods ensured accuracy.\n- **Thinking Process:** Throughout, I continuously checked if the numbers made sense and whether the methods aligned with the concept of compound interest.\n- **Learning Point:** It's always helpful to verify formula-based calculations with a simpler method, especially for concepts like compounding that build on previous amounts.\n\nIn conclusion, after thoroughly exploring different strategies and reflecting on each step, Alan will have approximately **\\$672** in his bank account after 10 years of compounding at 3% annually.",
