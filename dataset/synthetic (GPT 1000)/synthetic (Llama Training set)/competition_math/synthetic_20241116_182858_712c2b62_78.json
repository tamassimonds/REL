    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and approach it step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and ensure to check my work regularly to make sure I'm on the right track.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the function \\( f(x) = \\log_2(\\log_3(\\log_4(\\log_5 x))) \\), I remember that logarithmic functions have specific domains that stem from the properties of logarithms. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Nested Logarithms:** I notice there are multiple logarithmic functions nested inside each other. This reminds me that each logarithm imposes its own domain restrictions.\n- **Base and Argument:** I recall that for \\( \\log_b(a) \\), the base \\( b \\) must be positive and not equal to 1, and the argument \\( a \\) must be positive. This could help me determine the valid inputs for \\( x \\).\n- **Order of Operations:** Since the logarithms are nested, I think I need to ensure that each logarithm's argument is valid, starting from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if I should tackle it from the inside out or find a more straightforward method. Let's explore different strategies to see what works best.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n1. **Inside-Out Approach:** Start with the innermost logarithm \\( \\log_5 x \\) and determine its domain, then move outward to \\( \\log_4 \\), \\( \\log_3 \\), and finally \\( \\log_2 \\).\n2. **Graphical Perspective:** Visualize the function to understand where it might be undefined, although this might be more abstract for nested logarithms.\n3. **Algebraic Inequalities:** Set up inequalities based on the logarithmic properties to find the domain.\n\nI think the **Inside-Out Approach** makes the most sense because it aligns with how logarithmic functions are evaluated. Let's proceed with that.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing the Innermost Logarithm \\( \\log_5 x \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo ensure \\( \\log_5 x \\) is defined, the argument \\( x \\) must be greater than 0. Additionally, since \\( \\log_5 x \\) will be passed as the argument to \\( \\log_4 \\), it must also be greater than 1 (because the base 4 logarithm requires its argument to be positive and greater than 1).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- For \\( \\log_5 x \\) to be defined:  \n  \\[\n  x > 0\n  \\]\n- For \\( \\log_5 x \\) to be greater than 1:  \n  \\[\n  \\log_5 x > 1\n  \\]\n  \n  This inequality implies:\n  \\[\n  x > 5^1 = 5\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\nWait, so does this mean \\( x \\) has to be greater than 5 right away? That seems strict. But I need to ensure that \\( \\log_4(\\log_5 x) \\) is defined, so it makes sense to set \\( x > 5 \\).\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Domain for \\( \\log_4(\\log_5 x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need to check if \\( \\log_5 x \\) being greater than 1 is sufficient for \\( \\log_4(\\log_5 x) \\) to be defined. Let's assume \\( x > 5 \\) and see if any further conditions are needed.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- If \\( x > 5 \\), then \\( \\log_5 x > 1 \\) automatically.\n- Therefore, \\( \\log_4(\\log_5 x) \\) is defined for \\( x > 5 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems to work because if \\( x > 5 \\), then \\( \\log_5 x \\) is not only defined but also meets the requirement for \\( \\log_4 \\). So no additional constraints are needed at this level.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing \\( \\log_3(\\log_4(\\log_5 x)) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNext, I need to ensure that \\( \\log_4(\\log_5 x) \\) is greater than 1, as \\( \\log_3 \\) requires its argument to be greater than 1.\n\n**Calcululations:**\n- From Step 2, \\( \\log_4(\\log_5 x) > 1 \\).\n- This implies \\( \\log_5 x > 4^1 = 4 \\).\n\n  So,  \n  \\[\n  \\log_5 x > 4\n  \\]\n  \n  Converting this back to \\( x \\):\n  \\[\n  x > 5^4 = 625\n  \\]  \n   \n**Reflection:**\nWhoa, now \\( x \\) needs to be greater than 625? That escalates quickly! But I must ensure that all logarithms are defined, so this must be correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Domain for \\( \\log_2(\\log_3(\\log_4(\\log_5 x))) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nFinally, I need to check if \\( \\log_3(\\log_4(\\log_5 x)) \\) is defined when \\( x > 625 \\). Let's see if any further conditions apply.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- From Step 3, \\( \\log_5 x > 4 \\), which leads to \\( \\log_4(\\log_5 x) > 1 \\).\n- Now, \\( \\log_3(\\log_4(\\log_5 x)) \\) is automatically defined because \\( \\log_4(\\log_5 x) > 1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nIt looks like once \\( x > 625 \\), all the logarithmic conditions are satisfied. Each logarithm's argument is positive and greater than 1, which is necessary for the logarithm to be defined.\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's recap the steps to ensure everything makes sense:\n- Starting with \\( \\log_5 x \\): Needed \\( x > 5 \\).\n- Checked \\( \\log_4(\\log_5 x) \\): Required \\( \\log_5 x > 4 \\), leading to \\( x > 625 \\).\n- Verified \\( \\log_3(\\log_4(\\log_5 x)) \\): No further conditions beyond \\( x > 625 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything seems to align. Each logarithm's domain is satisfied by the condition \\( x > 625 \\). Therefore, the domain of the function \\( f(x) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(625, \\infty)}\n\\]\n\nThis solution methodically checked each level of the nested logarithm, ensuring all domain requirements were met, leading to a coherent and verified final answer.",
