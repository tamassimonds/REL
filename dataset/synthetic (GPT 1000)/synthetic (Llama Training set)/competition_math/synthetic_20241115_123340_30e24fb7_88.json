Let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a human thought process with brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting frequently, and checking our work as we go.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nAlright, the problem asks for the greatest prime factor of \\(3^7 + 6^6\\). At first glance, this looks like an expression involving exponents and addition. I remember that dealing with exponents often involves factoring or simplifying to find common bases or patterns. Maybe patterns like the sum of squares or cubes could help here.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Factoring:** Perhaps I can factor the expression to see if that reveals the prime factors more clearly.\n- **Simplifying exponents:** Maybe rewriting \\(6^6\\) in terms of \\(3\\) and \\(2\\) might simplify things.\n- **Using identities:** Could something like the binomial theorem or algebraic identities be useful?\n\nHmm, factoring seems like a good starting point. But I might need to explore other strategies if that doesn\u2019t work.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring the Factoring Strategy**\n\n**Approach:**\nLet\u2019s try to factor the expression \\(3^7 + 6^6\\). \n\n**Thought Process:**\nFirst, I notice that \\(6^6\\) can be rewritten in terms of its prime factors:\n\\[\n6 = 2 \\times 3 \\implies 6^6 = 2^6 \\times 3^6\n\\]\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\\[\n3^7 + 2^6 \\times 3^6\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\nWait, I see a common factor here. Both terms include \\(3^6\\). Maybe factoring out \\(3^6\\) could help simplify it.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n3^7 + 2^6 \\times 3^6 = 3^6(3 + 2^6)\n\\]\n\\[\n2^6 = 64 \\implies 3 + 64 = 67\n\\]\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[\n3^6 \\times 67\n\\]\n**Check:**\nDoes this make sense? Let\u2019s see. By factoring out \\(3^6\\), I\u2019m left with multiplication by \\(67\\). \n\n**Nature Check:**\n67 is an unfamiliar number to me. Is it prime? Hmm, let\u2019s hold onto that thought.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Factored Form**\n\n**Approach:**\nBefore moving on, let\u2019s verify that \\(3^6 \\times 67\\) is indeed equivalent to the original expression.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nReconstruct the original expression from the factored form and see if it matches.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n3^6 \\times 67 = 729 \\times 67\n\\]\nLet\u2019s calculate \\(729 \\times 67\\):\n\\[\n729 \\times 67 = 729 \\times (60 + 7) = 729 \\times 60 + 729 \\times 7 = 43740 + 5103 = 48843\n\\]\nNow, calculate \\(3^7 + 6^6\\) directly:\n\\[\n3^7 = 2187\n\\]\n\\[\n6^6 = (2 \\times 3)^6 = 2^6 \\times 3^6 = 64 \\times 729 = 46656\n\\]\n\\[\n3^7 + 6^6 = 2187 + 46656 = 48843\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\nBoth methods give the same result, \\(48843\\). So, the factoring seems correct.\n\n**Nature Check:**\nThis confirms that our factored form \\(3^6 \\times 67\\) is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying Prime Factors**\n\n**Approach:**\nNow that we have the expression factored as \\(3^6 \\times 67\\), let\u2019s identify the prime factors.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nPrime factors are the basic building blocks of numbers, so I\u2019m looking for prime numbers that multiply together to give the original expression.\n\n**Observation:**\n- \\(3^6\\) involves the prime number \\(3\\).\n- \\(67\\) is a separate factor.\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, is \\(67\\) prime? Let me recall\u2026 Prime numbers are greater than 1 and have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Hmm, let\u2019s double-check.\n\n**Check:**\nIs \\(67\\) divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (\\(\\sqrt{67} \\approx 8.19\\))? The primes to check are \\(2, 3, 5, 7\\):\n\n- **2:** \\(67\\) is odd, so not divisible by \\(2\\).\n- **3:** The sum of digits \\(6 + 7 = 13\\) is not divisible by \\(3\\).\n- **5:** Ends in \\(7\\), so not divisible by \\(5\\).\n- **7:** \\(67 \u00f7 7 \\approx 9.57\\), not an integer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince \\(67\\) is not divisible by any primes less than or equal to its square root, \\(67\\) is a prime number.\n\n**Reflection:**\nGreat! So, the prime factors are \\(3\\) and \\(67\\). The greatest prime factor is \\(67\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\n**Approach:**\nBased on the factoring and verification steps, let\u2019s finalize the answer.\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe greatest prime factor from the expression \\(3^7 + 6^6\\) is \\(67\\). I\u2019m confident because we factored the expression accurately and verified that \\(67\\) is a prime number.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n**The greatest prime factor of \\(3^7 + 6^6\\) is \\(67\\).**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Check:**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s do a final check to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Factoring Accuracy:** Confirmed that \\(3^7 + 6^6 = 3^6 \\times 67\\).\n- **Prime Factor Verification:** \\(3\\) and \\(67\\) are prime; \\(67\\) is not divisible by any primes less than its square root.\n- **Calculation Consistency:** Both direct computation and factored form yield the same result.\n\n**Nature Check:**\nEverything checks out. The factored form is correct, and the prime factors are accurately identified.\n\n**Reflection:**\nInitially, I considered different strategies like factoring and simplifying exponents. Factoring was effective here, leading to a straightforward identification of the prime factors. Exploring other methods didn\u2019t seem necessary once the factoring worked.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEmbracing a step-by-step approach, reflecting frequently, and verifying each part ensured the solution's correctness. The greatest prime factor is confidently identified as \\(67\\).\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough aligns with your expectations!
