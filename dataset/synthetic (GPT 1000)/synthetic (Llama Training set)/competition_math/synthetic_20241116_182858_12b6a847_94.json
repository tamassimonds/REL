It\u2019s important to approach it like I would if I were solving it on paper, thinking out loud, exploring different strategies, reflecting, and checking along the way. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d tackle it:\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem states that the product of two consecutive negative integers is 2550. I need to find the sum of these two integers. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving consecutive integers and their products. I think I\u2019ve tackled similar questions before, but it\u2019s been a while.\n- **Confusion:** I\u2019m a bit puzzled about how to handle negative integers since working with negative products can be tricky. Also, \"consecutive\" makes me think about how integers relate to each other.\n  \n**Brainstorming:**\n\nThe first thought that comes to mind is to set up an equation using variables. But I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the best approach right away.\n\n- **Alternative Ideas:**\n  - Maybe list out some pairs of consecutive negative integers and see their products.\n  - Use a quadratic equation because I know the product and need to find the integers.\n  - Check if there\u2019s a pattern or a formula that could help.\n\nLet me jot down these strategies:\n\n1. **List Consecutive Negative Integers:** See if I can find the pair by trial and error.\n2. **Set Up an Equation:** Use algebra to represent the product and solve for the integers.\n3. **Pattern Recognition:** Look for any patterns in negative products of consecutive integers.\n\nI think starting with listing some integers might give me an intuition, but it could be time-consuming. Setting up an equation seems more systematic, so let's begin there.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up an Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s define the two consecutive negative integers. Since they are negative and consecutive, I can represent them as:\n\n- Let \\( n \\) be the smaller integer.\n- Then, the next consecutive integer would be \\( n + 1 \\).\n\n**Equation Setup:**\n\nGiven that their product is 2550:\n\n\\[\nn \\times (n + 1) = 2550\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + n = 2550\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that looks like a standard quadratic equation setup. I remember from similar problems that quadratic equations can be solved by factoring, using the quadratic formula, or completing the square. But factoring might be tricky here since 2550 is a large number.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince factoring directly seems cumbersome, perhaps using the quadratic formula would be more straightforward. Let\u2019s proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe general form of a quadratic equation is:\n\n\\[\nax^2 + bx + c = 0\n\\]\n\nOur equation is:\n\n\\[\nn^2 + n - 2550 = 0\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = -2550 \\).\n\n**Quadratic Formula:**\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s plug in the values:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-2550)}}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 10200}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{10201}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-1 \\pm 101}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Finding Solutions:**\n\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n = \\frac{-102}{2} = -51\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, the positive solution (\\( n = 50 \\)) doesn\u2019t make sense because the problem specifies negative integers. Therefore, the valid solution is:\n\n\\[\nn = -51\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\nn + 1 = -51 + 1 = -50\n\\]\n\nSo, the two consecutive negative integers are \\( -51 \\) and \\( -50 \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s multiply them to verify:\n\n\\[\n-51 \\times -50 = 2550\n\\]\n\nWait, that checks out! The product is indeed 2550.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe two consecutive negative integers are \\( -51 \\) and \\( -50 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Sum**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the two integers, I need to find their sum.\n\n\\[\n-51 + (-50) = -101\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat seems straightforward. Adding them gives \\( -101 \\), which makes sense.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me quickly verify by adding:\n\n\\[\n-51 + (-50) = -51 - 50 = -101\n\\]\n\nYes, the sum is correctly \\( -101 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sum of the two consecutive negative integers is \\( -101 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Listing Consecutive Negative Integers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nJust to be thorough, let me see if listing negative integers would have led me to the same solution.\n\n**Listing:**\n\nLet\u2019s consider pairs of consecutive negative integers and their products:\n\n- \\( -1 \\times -2 = 2 \\)\n- \\( -2 \\times -3 = 6 \\)\n- \\( -3 \\times -4 = 12 \\)\n- \\( -4 \\times -5 = 20 \\)\n- \\( -5 \\times -6 = 30 \\)\n- ...\n- \\( -50 \\times -51 = 2550 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWow, that took a while! But it did lead me to \\( -50 \\) and \\( -51 \\) eventually.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nWhile this method worked, it\u2019s definitely less efficient than using an equation, especially with larger numbers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nListing integers can be a valid strategy, but it\u2019s time-consuming. Setting up an equation was a more systematic and faster approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore wrapping up, let me double-check everything to ensure the solution is correct.\n\n- **Product Verification:** \n  \\(-51 \\times -50 = 2550\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  \n- **Sum Calculation:** \n  \\(-51 + (-50) = -101\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The product is correct, and the sum is accurately calculated.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sum of the two consecutive negative integers whose product is 2550 is indeed \\( -101 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:** Starting with setting up an equation was effective.\n- **Alternative Method:** Listing integers helped confirm the solution but was less efficient.\n- **Importance of Checking:** Regular checks ensured that each step was correct and led to the right answer.\n- **Key Takeaway:** Approaching the problem methodically, being open to adjusting strategies, and continually reflecting helped arrive at the correct solution efficiently.\n\nI hope this detailed, step-by-step approach mimics the natural thought process of problem-solving, complete with brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting, checking, and adjusting as needed.

  "ground_truth": "We start out with the equation $n(n + 1) = 2550$. Expanding, we find $n^2 + n - 2550 = 0$. This factors to $(n - 50)(n + 51) = 0$, so $n = 50\\text{ or }-51.$ Since $n$ must be negative, we have $n = -51$, hence our two integers are $n = -51$ and $n + 1= -50$, which add up to $\\boxed{-101}$."
