    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, exploring different strategies, reflecting along the way, and checking our work to ensure correctness. I'll emulate a human thought process, complete with brainstorming, initial confusion, and gradual clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- **Mean and Median:** The question involves the **arithmetic mean** and **median** of three positive integers. I remember that the mean is the **average** of numbers, and the median is the **middle** value when arranged in order.\n- **Relationships Given:** There's a relationship between the median and the largest number, specifically that the median is **5 less** than the largest number.\n- **Goal:** Find the **smallest** number among these integers.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Set Up Equations:** Use the definitions of mean and median to create equations.\n  - **Order the Numbers:** Since mean and median are involved, arranging the numbers could help.\n  - **Substitution:** Use the relationship between the median and largest number to substitute in the equations.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Initial Reaction:** I think setting up equations might be a good start because it directly relates the mean and median to the numbers.\n- **Alternative Approach:** Maybe I can list possible sets of numbers that fit the median condition and see if they match the mean.\n\n**Decision:** Let's begin with setting up equations based on the definitions, as this seems the most straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Defining the Variables**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to represent the three integers. Since the exact values aren't given, I\u2019ll assign variables to them.\n- **Assumption:** Let\u2019s assume the integers are \\( a, b, c \\) where \\( a \\leq b \\leq c \\). This way, the median is clearly \\( b \\).\n\n**Equation Setup:**\n- Given that the median \\( b = 27 \\).\n- Also, \\( b = c - 5 \\) (since the median is 5 less than the largest number).\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **On Assigning Variables:** Ordering them ensures we correctly identify the median as \\( b \\).\n- **Potential Issue:** There could be multiple sets of integers that satisfy these conditions, but the mean should help narrow it down.\n\n**Check:** Are my assignments clear? Yes, \\( a, b, c \\) are ordered, and their relationships are defined.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Establishing Relationships**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I have \\( b = 27 \\) and \\( b = c - 5 \\). This gives me a direct relationship between \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n- I can substitute \\( b \\) into the second equation to find \\( c \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nb = c - 5 \\implies 27 = c - 5 \\implies c = 32\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Quick Check:** Does this make sense? If \\( b = 27 \\) and it\u2019s 5 less than \\( c \\), then \\( c \\) should be 32. That checks out.\n- **Potential Mistake:** Ensure that \\( a \\leq b \\leq c \\) still holds with these values.\n\n**Check:** Yes, \\( 27 \\leq 32 \\), and \\( a \\) is still unknown but must be less than or equal to 27.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Utilizing the Arithmetic Mean**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I know the arithmetic mean of the three integers is 26. The mean is calculated by summing the integers and dividing by the number of integers.\n- This gives me an equation to work with once I have \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n**Mean Formula:**\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{a + b + c}{3} = 26\n\\]\n\n**Substituting Known Values:**\n\\[\n\\frac{a + 27 + 32}{3} = 26\n\\]\n  \n**Solving for \\( a \\):**\n\\[\n\\frac{a + 59}{3} = 26 \\implies a + 59 = 78 \\implies a = 19\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Moment of Clarity:** So, the smallest number \\( a \\) is 19.\n- **Quick Check:** Does the mean make sense with these numbers? Let\u2019s verify.\n\n**Check:**\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{19 + 27 + 32}{3} = \\frac{78}{3} = 26\n\\]\n- **Result:** The mean checks out.\n\n**Realizations:**\n- **Correctness:** All conditions are satisfied: mean is 26, median is 27, and the median is 5 less than the largest number (32).\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Initially, I only considered setting up equations based on mean and median. Perhaps I could have also explored listing possible sets, but the equation approach was efficient here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Reflection and Confirmation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Re-examining Steps:** Did I miss anything? Is there another condition that needs to be satisfied?\n- **Ensuring All Conditions are Met:** Median, mean, and the relationship between median and largest number.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **Median Verification:** When arranged \\( 19, 27, 32 \\), the middle number is indeed 27.\n- **Mean Verification:** Calculated mean is 26.\n- **Relationship Verification:** \\( 32 - 27 = 5 \\), which matches the given condition.\n\n**Realizations:**\n- **Everything Aligns:** All conditions of the problem are satisfied with \\( a = 19 \\), \\( b = 27 \\), and \\( c = 32 \\).\n- **Alternative Approaches:** While setting up equations worked well, reflecting on whether listing possible integers could have been a backup plan is valuable. However, it seems unnecessary here since the equation method was straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{19}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The smallest number among the three integers is **19**.\n- Throughout the process, setting up clear relationships and verifying each step ensured the solution's correctness.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Thought Process:**\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:** Started with setting up equations based on mean and median.\n- **Defining Variables:** Assigned and ordered integers to easily identify mean and median.\n- **Establishing Relationships:** Used given conditions to relate median and largest number, then applied the mean formula.\n- **Reflection and Checks:** Constantly checked if conditions were met, ensuring the solution was valid.\n- **Final Confirmation:** Verified all given conditions were satisfied, leading to the correct answer.\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically and reflecting at each step, I ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The median of three integers is the middle integer. So the middle integer is $27$ and the largest integer is $27+5=32$. We also know that if the mean is $26$, then the sum of the three numbers is $26\\times3=78$. We subtract the other two numbers to find that the third number is $78-27-32=\\boxed{19}$."
