  "solution": "To determine the possible values of \\( n \\), which represents the number of integer roots of the polynomial \n\n\\[\nx^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( b, c, d, \\) and \\( e \\) are integers, we analyze the nature of polynomial roots.\n\n### Step 1: Degree of the Polynomial\nThe polynomial is of degree 4, implying it can have at most 4 roots in total (including multiplicities).\n\n### Step 2: Possible Values for Integer Roots\n1. **\\( n = 0 \\)**: The polynomial has no integer roots (e.g., \\( x^4 + 1 = 0 \\), which has complex roots).\n2. **\\( n = 1 \\)**: There is one integer root, with the other three roots being non-integer roots (e.g., \\( (x - 1)(x^3 + 2) = 0 \\); here, 1 is the only integer root).\n3. **\\( n = 2 \\)**: There can be two integer roots, which could be:\n   - Two distinct integer roots.\n   - One integer root with a multiplicity of 2.\n   - The remaining roots being non-integers (e.g., \\( (x - 1)^2(x^2 + 1) = 0 \\), where \\( 1 \\) is a double root, and the other roots are non-integers).\n4. **\\( n = 3 \\)**: If there are three integer roots, then the fourth root must also be an integer (due to Vieta's formulas). Thus, it leads to a total of four integer roots, making the case of having exactly three integer roots impossible.\n5. **\\( n = 4 \\)**: All four roots can be integers (e.g., \\( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) = 0 \\), which has integer roots \\( 1, 2, 3, \\) and \\( 4 \\)).\n\n### Step 3: Validity of Each Scenario\nHaving established the scenarios for \\( n \\):\n- **For \\( n = 0 \\)**: As shown, a polynomial like \\( x^4 + 1 \\) yields no integer roots.\n- **For \\( n = 1 \\)**: The polynomial \\( (x - 1)(x^3 + 2) \\) provides one integer root, \\( 1 \\).\n- **For \\( n = 2 \\)**: The example \\( (x - 1)^2(x^2 + 1) \\) illustrates two integer roots via a double root.\n- **For \\( n = 4 \\)**: The polynomial \\( (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4) \\) demonstrates that all roots are integers.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the possible integer root counts \\( n \\) can be:\n\n- 0: No integer roots.\n- 1: One integer root.\n- 2: Two integer roots.\n- 4: Four integer roots.\n\nThus, the possible values of \\( n \\) are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0, 1, 2, 4}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The polynomial $x^4 + 1 = 0$ shows that $n$ can be 0\n\nThe polynomial $x(x^3 + 2)$ shows that $n$ can be 1.\n\nThe polynomial $x^2 (x^2 + 1)$ shows that $n$ can be 2.\n\nThe polynomial $x^4$ shows that $n$ can be 4.\n\nSuppose the polynomial has three integer roots.  By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $-b,$ which is an integer.  Therefore, the fourth root is also an integer, so it is impossible to have exactly three integer roots.\n\nThus, the possible values of $n$ are $\\boxed{0, 1, 2, 4}.$"
