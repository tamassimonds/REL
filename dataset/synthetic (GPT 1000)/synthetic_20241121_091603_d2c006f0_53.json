  "problem": "There are positive integers that have these properties:\n\n$\\bullet$ I. The sum of the squares of their digits is $50,$ and\n\n$\\bullet$ II. Each digit is larger than the one on its left.\n\nWhat is the product of the digits of the largest integer with both properties?",
  "solution": "To address the problem, we need to find positive integers that fulfill two main criteria:\n\n1. The sum of the squares of their digits equals 50.\n2. The digits are strictly increasing.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Usable Digits\n\nThe eligible digits are 1 through 9, with their corresponding squares as follows:\n\n- \\(1^2 = 1\\)\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n- \\(4^2 = 16\\)\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\)\n- \\(7^2 = 49\\)\n- \\(8^2 = 64\\) (not usable, exceeds 50)\n- \\(9^2 = 81\\) (not usable, exceeds 50)\n\n### Step 2: Explore Combinations of Digits\n\nNext, we explore combinations of these digits to achieve a total square sum of 50 while ensuring the digits are distinct and in increasing order.\n\n**Single Digit Combination:**\n- Using \\(7\\) and \\(1\\):\n  - \\(7^2 + 1^2 = 49 + 1 = 50\\)\n  - Resulting in the digits 1 and 7, forming the number **17**.\n\n**Multiple Digit Combinations:**\n1. Using \\(6, 3, 2,\\) and \\(1\\):\n   - \\(6^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 36 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 50\\)\n   - This combination gives us the digits 1, 2, 3, and 6, yielding the number **1236**.\n\n2. Using \\(5, 4,\\) and \\(3\\):\n   - \\(5^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 = 25 + 16 + 9 = 50\\)\n   - This results in the digits 3, 4, and 5, forming the number **345**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Largest Number\n\nFrom the valid combinations, we have:\n- **17**\n- **1236**\n- **345**\n\nThe largest number among these is **1236**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Product of the Digits\n\nNow, we will calculate the product of the digits of the number 1236:\n\\[\n1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 6 = 36\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe product of the digits of the largest integer that meets both criteria is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "To meet the first condition, numbers which sum to $50$ must be chosen from the set of squares $\\{1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49\\}.$ To meet the second condition, the squares selected must be different. Consequently, there are three possibilities: $1+49,$ $1+4+9+36,$ and $9+16+25.$ These correspond to the integers $17,$ $1236,$ and $345,$ respectively. The largest is $1236,$ and the product of its digits is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot6=\\boxed{36}.$"
