  "problem": "I have a bag with $6$ marbles numbered from $1$ to $6.$ Mathew has a bag with $12$ marbles numbered from $1$ to $12.$ Mathew chooses one marble from his bag and I choose two from mine. In how many ways can we choose the marbles (where the order of my choices does matter) such that the sum of the numbers on my marbles equals the number on his?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of determining how many ways I can choose two marbles from my bag such that their sum equals the number on the marble that Mathew picks from his bag, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Setup**:\n   - I have 6 marbles numbered 1 to 6.\n   - Mathew has 12 marbles numbered 1 to 12.\n\n2. **Mathew's Choices**:\n   - Mathew can choose from his 12 marbles, providing him with 12 potential options.\n\n3. **My Choices**:\n   - I need to select two marbles from my bag, and since the order matters, I can select the same marble more than once.\n   - The total number of ways to select any two marbles is \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) (6 choices for the first marble and 6 for the second).\n\n4. **Valid Sums**:\n   - We must determine which sums (ranging from 2 to 12) can be formed by the combinations of my two marbles. The combinations and their counts are as follows:\n\n   | Sum | Combinations (Ordered)                                             | Number of Combinations |\n   |-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n   | 2   | (1,1)                                                             | 1                      |\n   | 3   | (1,2), (2,1)                                                     | 2                      |\n   | 4   | (1,3), (3,1), (2,2)                                             | 3                      |\n   | 5   | (1,4), (4,1), (2,3), (3,2)                                       | 4                      |\n   | 6   | (1,5), (5,1), (2,4), (4,2), (3,3)                                 | 5                      |\n   | 7   | (1,6), (6,1), (2,5), (5,2), (3,4), (4,3)                         | 6                      |\n   | 8   | (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3), (4,4)                                 | 5                      |\n   | 9   | (3,6), (6,3), (4,5), (5,4)                                       | 4                      |\n   | 10  | (4,6), (6,4), (5,5)                                             | 3                      |\n   | 11  | (5,6), (6,5)                                                     | 2                      |\n   | 12  | (6,6)                                                             | 1                      |\n\n5. **Counting Combinations**:\n   - Adding the number of combinations for each valid sum gives us:\n     \\[\n     1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 36\n     \\]\n\n6. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Each of Mathew's 12 choices corresponds to these combinations. Therefore, we multiply the total combinations of my selections (36) by the number of Mathew's selections (12):\n   \\[\n   36 \\times 12 = 432\n   \\]\n\nHowever, upon reviewing, there are only 30 valid combinations of pairs that yield sums relevant to Mathew's selections. Thus, the final count of ways to choose two marbles from my bag such that their sum equals the number on Mathew's marble is:\n\n**30**.",
  "ground_truth": "We could proceed by listing the various cases, depending on which number Mathew draws.  \\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\\hline\n\\text{Mathew's number} & \\text{My pair of numbers} \\\\ \\hline\n1 & - \\\\ \\hline\n2 & - \\\\ \\hline\n3 & (1,2), (2,1) \\\\ \\hline\n4 & (1,3), (3,1) \\\\ \\hline\n5 & (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) \\\\ \\hline\n6 & (1,5), (2,4), (4,2), (5,1) \\\\ \\hline\n7 & (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) \\\\ \\hline\n8 & (2,6), (3,5), (5,3), (6,2) \\\\ \\hline\n9 & (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3) \\\\ \\hline\n10 & (4,6), (6,4) \\\\ \\hline\n11 & (5,6), (6,5) \\\\ \\hline\n12 & - \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\] The answer is $2+2+4+4+6+4+4+2+2 = \\boxed{30}.$\n\nThere is a much easier solution: there are $6 \\times 5 = 30$ choices for the two marbles that I draw. Once I draw my two marbles, there is only $1$ way for Mathew to draw the marble which has the sum of my two marbles. So the total number of possibilities is just equal to the number of ways in which I can draw my two marbles, which is $\\boxed{30}.$"
