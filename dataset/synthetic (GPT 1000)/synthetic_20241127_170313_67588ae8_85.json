  "solution": "Absolutely, let's refine the solution to make it more cohesive and professional while maintaining the original thought process. I'll ensure the narrative flows logically, correcting any inconsistencies and enhancing clarity without altering the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have two skaters, Allie and Billie, starting 100 meters apart. Allie skates from point \\( A \\) at 8 m/s along a path making a \\( 60^\\circ \\) angle with the line \\( AB \\). Billie starts from \\( B \\) at 7 m/s, aiming to meet Allie as soon as possible. Our goal is to determine how far Allie skates before meeting Billie.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This feels like a relative motion problem involving angles and velocities. Strategies like breaking down velocity into components or using geometric relationships come to mind.\n  \n- **Possible Approaches:**\n  1. Use vector components to express positions over time.\n  2. Apply the Law of Cosines to find the meeting point.\n  3. Consider relative motion to simplify the interaction between the skaters.\n\nGiven the nature of the problem, starting with **vector components** seems straightforward, but I'll remain flexible and ready to switch strategies if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up Vector Components for Allie**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's establish a coordinate system for clarity. I'll set point \\( A \\) at the origin \\((0, 0)\\) and point \\( B \\) at \\((100, 0)\\). Allie's path makes a \\( 60^\\circ \\) angle with \\( AB \\), so I'll decompose her velocity into \\( x \\)- and \\( y \\)-components.\n\n- **Calculations:**\n  - \\( v_{Ax} = 8 \\cos(60^\\circ) = 4 \\) m/s\n  - \\( v_{Ay} = 8 \\sin(60^\\circ) = 4\\sqrt{3} \\) m/s\n\n- **Position Over Time:**\n  - \\( x_A(t) = 4t \\)\n  - \\( y_A(t) = 4\\sqrt{3}t \\)\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nStarting from the origin, these components make sense, moving Allie right and up at the specified angles.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determining Billie\u2019s Path**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBillie needs to skate in a direction that minimizes the meeting time. Initially, I considered assigning Billie an unknown angle \\( \\theta \\), but it becomes clear that her optimal path is directly toward Allie's moving position.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nInstead of assigning an arbitrary angle, I'll express Billie\u2019s path as directly targeting Allie\u2019s position over time.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up the Meeting Condition**\n\n**Meeting Point Definition:**  \nAt time \\( t_m \\), both skaters meet at the same point \\( M(x_m, y_m) \\).\n\n- **Allie\u2019s Position at \\( t_m \\):**\n  - \\( x_m = 4t_m \\)\n  - \\( y_m = 4\\sqrt{3}t_m \\)\n\n- **Billie\u2019s Strategy:**  \nBillie skates directly towards \\( M \\) from \\( B \\) \\((100, 0)\\) at 7 m/s.\n\n**Calculating the Distance Billie Travels:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_m - 100)^2 + y_m^2}\n\\]\n\n**Expressing in Terms of \\( t_m \\):**  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{(4t_m - 100)^2 + (4\\sqrt{3}t_m)^2} = 7t_m\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the Equation**\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{(16t_m^2 - 800t_m + 10000) + (48t_m^2)} = 7t_m\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{64t_m^2 - 800t_m + 10000} = 7t_m\n\\]\n\n**Squaring Both Sides to Eliminate the Square Root:**  \n\\[\n64t_m^2 - 800t_m + 10000 = 49t_m^2\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging the Equation:**  \n\\[\n15t_m^2 - 800t_m + 10000 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Applying the Quadratic Formula:**  \n\\[\nt_m = \\frac{800 \\pm \\sqrt{800^2 - 4 \\times 15 \\times 10000}}{2 \\times 15}\n\\]\n\\[\nt_m = \\frac{800 \\pm \\sqrt{640000 - 600000}}{30}\n\\]\n\\[\nt_m = \\frac{800 \\pm \\sqrt{40000}}{30}\n\\]\n\\[\nt_m = \\frac{800 \\pm 200}{30}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating Possible Solutions:**  \n\\[\nt_m = \\frac{1000}{30} = \\frac{100}{3} \\approx 33.33 \\, \\text{seconds}\n\\]\n\\[\nt_m = \\frac{600}{30} = 20 \\, \\text{seconds}\n\\]\n\n**Choosing the Valid Solution:**  \nSince we're seeking the earliest meeting time, **\\( t_m = 20 \\) seconds** is the appropriate solution.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nMeeting in 20 seconds with their respective speeds seems plausible, confirming the validity of this solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Distance Allie Skates**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAllie skates at 8 m/s for \\( t_m = 20 \\) seconds.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 8 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 20 \\, \\text{s} = 160 \\, \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**  \nThis distance aligns with Allie\u2019s constant speed and the time calculated, ensuring consistency with the problem\u2019s parameters.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: Stating the Answer Clearly**\n\n<ANSWER>Allie skates 160 meters before meeting Billie.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Reflections**\n\n- **Initial Missteps:**  \n  Initially, assigning Billie an arbitrary angle led to impossible values for cosine and sine. Recognizing this inconsistency prompted a reevaluation of Billie\u2019s path.\n\n- **Correcting the Approach:**  \n  By relating Billie\u2019s path directly to Allie\u2019s position, the problem simplified, leading to a valid and straightforward solution.\n\n- **Importance of Flexibility:**  \n  Being open to adjusting strategies ensured the correct handling of the problem, highlighting the value of adaptability in problem-solving.\n\n- **Learning Outcome:**  \n  Accurate setup of initial conditions and a willingness to rethink approaches are crucial for solving complex kinematics problems effectively.\n\n- **Overall Reflection:**  \n  Through iterative thinking and validating each step, the correct solution was achieved, reinforcing the importance of careful analysis and flexibility in problem-solving.\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, recognizing and correcting initial errors, and validating each step, the final solution remains robust and accurate.",
