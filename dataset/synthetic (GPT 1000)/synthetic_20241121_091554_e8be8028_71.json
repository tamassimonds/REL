  "problem": "If $n = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^{14} \\cdot 5^{8}$, how many of the natural-number factors of $n$ are multiples of 150?",
  "solution": "To determine how many natural-number factors of \\( n = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^{14} \\cdot 5^{8} \\) are multiples of 150, we first find the prime factorization of 150:\n\n\\[\n150 = 2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^2\n\\]\n\nA factor \\( d \\) of \\( n \\) that is a multiple of 150 must contain at least the prime factors of 150, with the minimum powers specified. Thus, \\( d \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nd = 2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c\n\\]\n\nwith the following conditions:\n\n- \\( a \\geq 1 \\)\n- \\( b \\geq 1 \\)\n- \\( c \\geq 2 \\)\n\nSince \\( d \\) is also a factor of \\( n \\), the powers \\( a, b, c \\) must adhere to the maximum limits given by \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\n1 \\leq a \\leq 10, \\quad 1 \\leq b \\leq 14, \\quad 2 \\leq c \\leq 8\n\\]\n\nNow, we count the permissible values for \\( a, b, c \\):\n\n1. **For \\( a \\)**:\n   - Values: \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10 \\)\n   - Total options: \\( 10 - 1 + 1 = 10 \\)\n\n2. **For \\( b \\)**:\n   - Values: \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 14 \\)\n   - Total options: \\( 14 - 1 + 1 = 14 \\)\n\n3. **For \\( c \\)**:\n   - Values: \\( 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \\)\n   - Total options: \\( 8 - 2 + 1 = 7 \\)\n\nFinally, the total number of factors of \\( n \\) that are multiples of 150 is found by multiplying the number of choices for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total factors} = (10 \\text{ choices for } a) \\times (14 \\text{ choices for } b) \\times (7 \\text{ choices for } c) = 10 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 7 = 980\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of natural-number factors of \\( n \\) that are multiples of 150 is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{980}\n\\] \n\nIn text format:\n\n<ANSWER>980</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "$150=2^13^15^2$.  Thus the coefficient of $2$ must be between $1$ and $10$, the coefficient of $3$ must be between $1$ and $14$, and the coefficient of $5$ must be between $2$ and $8$.  So the number of possible factors is\n\n$$(10)(14)(7)=\\boxed{980}$$"
