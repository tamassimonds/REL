  "problem": "Sue owns 11 pairs of shoes: six identical black pairs, three identical brown pairs and two identical gray pairs. If she picks two shoes at random, what is the probability that they are the same color and that one is a left shoe and the other is a right shoe? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we will calculate the total number of shoes Sue owns, the total ways to select two shoes, and then the number of ways to select two shoes of the same color (one left and one right). Finally, we will determine the probability of this event.\n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Shoes\nSue has:\n- 6 pairs of black shoes (6 left and 6 right)\n- 3 pairs of brown shoes (3 left and 3 right)\n- 2 pairs of gray shoes (2 left and 2 right)\n\nCalculating:\n- Total left shoes = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n- Total right shoes = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11\n\n**Total number of shoes**: 11 left + 11 right = **22 shoes**.\n\n### Step 2: Total Ways to Pick Two Shoes\nTo find the total number of ways to select 2 shoes from 22, we use the combination formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\):\n\\[\nC(22, 2) = \\frac{22 \\times 21}{2 \\times 1} = 231\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Successful Outcomes (Matching Pairs)\nNext, we count the successful outcomes where we pick one left shoe and one right shoe of the same color.\n\n1. **Black Shoes**: \n   - Ways to pick one left and one right: \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\).\n\n2. **Brown Shoes**: \n   - Ways to pick one left and one right: \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n\n3. **Gray Shoes**: \n   - Ways to pick one left and one right: \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\).\n\n**Total successful outcomes**: \n\\[\n36 + 9 + 4 = 49\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability\nNow, we find the probability of picking a matching pair (same color, one left and one right):\n\\[\nP(\\text{same color, left and right}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{49}{231}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplifying the Fraction\nTo simplify \\( \\frac{49}{231} \\), we identify the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 49 and 231. The prime factorization shows:\n- 49 = \\( 7^2 \\)\n- 231 = \\( 3 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\)\n\nThe GCD is 7. We simplify:\n\\[\n\\frac{49 \\div 7}{231 \\div 7} = \\frac{7}{33}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the probability that Sue picks two shoes that are the same color, with one being a left shoe and the other a right shoe, is:\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{33}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "We will consider these by the cases of what our first shoe selection is. If our first shoe is black, which happens with probability $\\frac{12}{22}$, then our second shoe will be black and for the opposite foot with probability $\\frac{6}{21}$. Likewise, for brown shoes, our probability is the product $\\frac{6}{22} \\cdot \\frac{3}{21}$. And for gray, $\\frac{4}{22} \\cdot \\frac{2}{21}$. So the sum is equal to $\\frac{12\\cdot 6 + 6 \\cdot 3 + 4 \\cdot 2}{22 \\cdot 21} = \\frac{98}{33\\cdot 14} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{33}}$."
