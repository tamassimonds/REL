  "problem": "Real numbers $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 10x - 6y - 34$.  What is $x+y$?",
  "solution": "To solve the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 10x - 6y - 34\\), we start by rearranging the equation to standard form:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 - 10x + 6y + 34 = 0\n\\]\n\nNext, we will complete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n1. **Completing the square for \\(x\\)**:\n   - The terms in \\(x\\) are \\(x^2 - 10x\\).\n   - To complete the square, we take half of -10, square it, and add it:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{-10}{2}\\right)^2 = 25\n     \\]\n   - This allows us to rewrite the \\(x\\) terms as:\n     \\[\n     (x - 5)^2 - 25\n     \\]\n\n2. **Completing the square for \\(y\\)**:\n   - The terms in \\(y\\) are \\(y^2 + 6y\\).\n   - We take half of 6, square it, and adjust accordingly:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{6}{2}\\right)^2 = 9\n     \\]\n   - The \\(y\\) terms become:\n     \\[\n     (y + 3)^2 - 9\n     \\]\n\n3. **Incorporating completed squares into the equation**:\n   Substitute the completed squares back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + 34 = 0\n\\]\n\n4. **Simplifying the equation**:\n   Combining the constant terms results in:\n\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nThe expression \\((x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0\\) is satisfied only when both components are zero:\n\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 = 0 \\implies x = 5\n\\]\n\\[\n(y + 3)^2 = 0 \\implies y = -3\n\\]\n\n5. **Calculating \\(x+y\\)**:\nNow, we can find the sum of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\nx + y = 5 + (-3) = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "If we complete the square after bringing the $x$ and $y$ terms to the other side, we get \\[(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 0.\\]Squares of real numbers are nonnegative, so we need both $(x-5)^2$ and $(y+3)^2$ to be $0.$  This only happens when $x = 5$ and $y = -3.$ Thus, $x+y = 5 + (-3) = \\boxed{2}.$"
