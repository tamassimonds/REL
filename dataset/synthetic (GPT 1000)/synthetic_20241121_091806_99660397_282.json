  "problem": "Each of two boxes contains both black and white marbles, and the total number of marbles in the two boxes is $25.$ One marble is taken out of each box randomly. The probability that both marbles are black is $27/50,$ and the probability that both marbles are white is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m + n$?\n",
  "solution": "To solve the given problem about marbles in two boxes, we define several variables to represent the number of black and white marbles. We denote:\n\n- \\( b_1 \\): number of black marbles in box 1\n- \\( w_1 \\): number of white marbles in box 1\n- \\( b_2 \\): number of black marbles in box 2\n- \\( w_2 \\): number of white marbles in box 2\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following equations:\n\n1. The total number of marbles in both boxes:\n   \\[\n   b_1 + w_1 + b_2 + w_2 = 25\n   \\]\n\n2. The probability that both marbles drawn are black:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b_1}{b_1 + w_1} \\cdot \\frac{b_2}{b_2 + w_2} = \\frac{27}{50}\n   \\]\n\nWe denote:\n- \\( T_1 = b_1 + w_1 \\) (total marbles in box 1)\n- \\( T_2 = b_2 + w_2 \\) (total marbles in box 2)\n\nThus, we can rewrite the total as:\n\\[\nT_1 + T_2 = 25 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad T_2 = 25 - T_1\n\\]\n\nThe probability that both marbles drawn are black can then be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\frac{b_1}{T_1} \\cdot \\frac{b_2}{T_2} = \\frac{27}{50}\n\\]\n\nLet:\n- \\( p_1 = \\frac{b_1}{T_1} \\)\n- \\( p_2 = \\frac{b_2}{T_2} \\)\n\nThus, we have:\n\\[\np_1 p_2 = \\frac{27}{50}\n\\]\n\nFor the probability of drawing two white marbles, we express it as:\n\\[\n\\frac{w_1}{T_1} \\cdot \\frac{w_2}{T_2} = \\frac{(T_1 - b_1)(T_2 - b_2)}{T_1 T_2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( T_2 = 25 - T_1 \\) provides:\n\\[\n= \\frac{(T_1 - b_1)((25 - T_1) - b_2)}{T_1 (25 - T_1)}\n\\]\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\\[\n= \\frac{(1 - p_1)(1 - p_2)}{T_1(25 - T_1)}\n\\]\n\nUsing the relationship \\( p_1 p_2 = \\frac{27}{50} \\), we also know:\n\\[\n(1 - p_1)(1 - p_2) = 1 - (p_1 + p_2) + \\frac{27}{50}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( p_1 + p_2 \\), we can analyze the total probabilities and create a quadratic equation:\n\\[\nx^2 - sx + p = 0\n\\]\nwhere \\( s = p_1 + p_2 \\) and \\( p = \\frac{27}{50} \\).\n\nNext, we test various values for \\( T_1 \\) and \\( T_2 \\) (which must sum to 25) to find combinations of \\( b_1, w_1, b_2, w_2 \\) that satisfy the black marble probability. For example, if we try:\n\n- \\( T_1 = 20 \\) and \\( T_2 = 5 \\), we can set \\( b_1 = 18 \\), \\( w_1 = 2 \\), \\( b_2 = 3 \\), and \\( w_2 = 2 \\).\n\nCalculating the probability of both being white:\n\\[\nP(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{2}{20} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{2}{50}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we compute:\n\\[\nP(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{(1 - p_1)(1 - p_2)}{T_1 T_2}\n\\]\n\nUsing the established probabilities and simplifying leads us to a final fraction for the white marble probability, represented as \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\).\n\nThus, after simplifying, we find that \\( m + n = 26 \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{<ANSWER>26</ANSWER>}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "If we work with the problem for a little bit, we quickly see that there is no direct combinatorics way to calculate $m/n$. The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion still requires us to find the individual probability of each box.\nLet $a, b$ represent the number of marbles in each box, and without loss of generality let $a>b$. Then, $a + b = 25$, and since the $ab$ may be reduced to form $50$ on the denominator of $\\frac{27}{50}$, $50|ab$. It follows that $5|a,b$, so there are 2 pairs of $a$ and $b: (20,5),(15,10)$.\nCase 1: Then the product of the number of black marbles in each box is $54$, so the only combination that works is $18$ black in first box, and $3$ black in second. Then, $P(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{2}{20} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{1}{25},$ so $m + n = 26$.\nCase 2: The only combination that works is 9 black in both. Thus, $P(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{1}{10}\\cdot \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{1}{25}$. $m + n = 26$.\nThus, $m + n = \\boxed{26}$."
