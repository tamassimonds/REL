  "problem": "For what values of $x$ is $x^2-2x>35$? Express your answer in interval notation.",
  "solution": "To solve the inequality \\( x^2 - 2x > 35 \\), we proceed with the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Rearranging the Inequality\nWe start by moving \\( 35 \\) to the left-hand side of the inequality:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 2x - 35 > 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Factoring the Quadratic\nNext, we factor the quadratic expression \\( x^2 - 2x - 35 \\). We need two numbers that multiply to \\( -35 \\) and add to \\( -2 \\). These numbers are \\( 5 \\) and \\( -7 \\). Therefore, we can express the inequality as:\n\n\\[\n(x - 7)(x + 5) > 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Roots\nWe find the roots by setting the factors equal to zero:\n\n\\[\nx - 7 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 7\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 5 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -5\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Testing Intervals\nThe roots divide the number line into three intervals: \\( (-\\infty, -5) \\), \\( (-5, 7) \\), and \\( (7, \\infty) \\). We will test a point from each interval to see where the inequality holds true.\n\n1. **Interval \\( (-\\infty, -5) \\)**: Test \\( x = -6 \\):\n   \\[\n   (-6 - 7)(-6 + 5) = (-13)(-1) = 13 > 0 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Interval \\( (-5, 7) \\)**: Test \\( x = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   (0 - 7)(0 + 5) = (-7)(5) = -35 < 0 \\quad \\text{(False)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Interval \\( (7, \\infty) \\)**: Test \\( x = 8 \\):\n   \\[\n   (8 - 7)(8 + 5) = (1)(13) = 13 > 0 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nFrom our tests, the inequality \\( (x - 7)(x + 5) > 0 \\) is satisfied in the intervals \\( (-\\infty, -5) \\) and \\( (7, \\infty) \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nExcluding the points where the product equals zero, \\( -5 \\) and \\( 7 \\), the solution in interval notation is:\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -5) \\cup (7, \\infty)\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "After moving the constant over, we get a quadratic expression and solve for the roots: \\begin{align*}\nx^2-2x-35&>0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(x-7)(x+5)&>0.\n\\end{align*} The quadratic expression equals 0 at $x=7$ and $x=-5$, meaning it changes sign at each root. Now we look at the sign of the quadratic when $x<-5$, when $-5<x<7$, and when $x>7$. When $x<-5$, $(x-7)$ and $(x+5)$ are both negative, so the product is positive. When $-5<x<7$, $(x+5)$ becomes positive, while $(x-7)$ remains negative - the product is negative. When $x>7$, both factors are positive, so the product is positive. So, $(x-7)(x+5)>0$ when $x<-5$ or $x>7$, which means our answer in interval notation is $\\boxed{(-\\infty, -5) \\cup (7, \\infty)}$.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, so a graph of $(x-7)(x+5)=0$ would open up. When there are two distinct roots, the shape of the parabola means that product is negative when $x$ is between the roots and positive when $x$ is less than both roots or greater than both roots."
