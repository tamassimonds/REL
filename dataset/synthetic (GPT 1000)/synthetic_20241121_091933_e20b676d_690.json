  "problem": "Richard is building a rectangular backyard from 360 feet of fencing. The fencing must cover three sides of the backyard (the fourth side is bordered by Richard's house). What is the maximum area of this backyard?",
  "solution": "To determine the maximum area of Richard's rectangular backyard enclosed by 360 feet of fencing on three sides, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: Let \\( L \\) represent the length of the backyard parallel to the house, and \\( W \\) the width perpendicular to it.\n\n2. **Set Up the Perimeter Equation**: The fencing must cover two widths and one length, leading to the equation:\n   \\[\n   L + 2W = 360\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives us:\n   \\[\n   L = 360 - 2W\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Area**: The area \\( A \\) of the backyard can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   A = L \\times W\n   \\]\n   Substituting the expression for \\( L \\) into the area formula yields:\n   \\[\n   A = (360 - 2W) \\times W = 360W - 2W^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Maximize the Area**: To find the maximum area, we differentiate \\( A \\) with respect to \\( W \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dA}{dW} = 360 - 4W\n   \\]\n   Setting this derivative to zero for optimization gives:\n   \\[\n   360 - 4W = 0 \\implies 4W = 360 \\implies W = 90\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Length**: With \\( W \\) known, we find \\( L \\):\n   \\[\n   L = 360 - 2(90) = 360 - 180 = 180\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate Maximum Area**: The maximum area is then calculated as:\n   \\[\n   A = L \\times W = 180 \\times 90 = 16200 \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Verify Constraints**: To ensure the solution is correct, we verify the fencing used:\n   \\[\n   L + 2W = 180 + 2(90) = 180 + 180 = 360 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum area of Richard's backyard is:\n<ANSWER>16200 square feet</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let the length of the backyard be $l$ and the width be $w$. We have the equation $l+2w=360$. We want to maximize the area of this rectangular backyard, which is given by $lw$. From our equation, we know that $l=360-2w$. Substituting this into our expression for area, we have \\[(360-2w)(w)=360w-2w^2\\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression. Factoring a $-2$ out, we have \\[-2(w^2-180w)\\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(180/2)^2=8100$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we get \\[-2(w^2-180w+8100-8100) \\Rightarrow -2(w-90)^2+16200\\]Since the maximum value of $-2(w-90)^2$ is 0 (perfect squares are always nonnegative), the maximum value of the entire expression is 16200, which is achieved when $w=90$ and $l=360-2w=180$. Thus, the maximum area of the backyard is $\\boxed{16200}$ square feet."
