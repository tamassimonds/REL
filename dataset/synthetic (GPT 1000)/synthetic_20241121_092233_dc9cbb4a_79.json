  "solution": "To determine the values of \\( j \\) for which the equation \\((2x+7)(x-5) = -43 + jx\\) has exactly one real solution, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Expand the Left Side\n\nFirst, we expand the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n(2x + 7)(x - 5) = 2x^2 - 10x + 7x - 35 = 2x^2 - 3x - 35\n\\]\n\nSo the equation now looks like:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 3x - 35 = -43 + jx\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange the Equation\n\nNext, we rearrange the equation to get all terms on one side:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 3x - jx - 35 + 43 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - (3 + j)x + 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Identify Coefficients\n\nWe can identify the coefficients from the standard quadratic form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\):\n\n- \\( a = 2 \\)\n- \\( b = -(3 + j) \\)\n- \\( c = 8 \\)\n\n### Step 4: Find Condition for One Real Solution\n\nA quadratic equation has exactly one real solution when its discriminant is zero. The discriminant \\( D \\) is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in our coefficients gives:\n\n\\[\nD = (-(3 + j))^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8 = (3 + j)^2 - 64\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Set the Discriminant to Zero\n\nTo find the values of \\( j \\), we set the discriminant to zero:\n\n\\[\n(3 + j)^2 - 64 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n(3 + j)^2 = 64\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides leads to two equations:\n\n\\[\n3 + j = 8 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 3 + j = -8\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( j \\)\n\n1. From \\( 3 + j = 8 \\):\n   \\[\n   j = 8 - 3 = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. From \\( 3 + j = -8 \\):\n   \\[\n   j = -8 - 3 = -11\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the values of \\( j \\) for which the equation has exactly one real solution are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5, -11}\n\\]\n\nFinal answer in the required format:\n\n<ANSWER> 5, -11 </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We begin by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation and subtracting $-43+jx$ from both sides. We get $2x^2+(-3-j)x+8=0$. For this quadratic to have exactly one real root, the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ must be equal to $0$. Thus, we require $(-3-j)^2-4(2)(8) = 0$. Solving, we get that $j=\\boxed{5,\\,-11}$."
