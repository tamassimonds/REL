  "problem": "For how many positive integers $n\\geq 2$ is $1001_n$ a prime number?",
  "solution": "To determine how many positive integers \\( n \\geq 2 \\) make \\( 1001_n \\) a prime number, we interpret \\( 1001_n \\) in base \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\n1001_n = 1 \\cdot n^3 + 0 \\cdot n^2 + 0 \\cdot n + 1 = n^3 + 1.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to examine the conditions under which \\( n^3 + 1 \\) can be prime. We can factor \\( n^3 + 1 \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\nn^3 + 1 = (n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1).\n\\]\n\nFor \\( n^3 + 1 \\) to be a prime number, it must equal a prime number multiplied by 1, implying that one of these factors must equal 1.\n\n### Case Analysis\n\n1. **Case 1: \\( n + 1 = 1 \\)**   \n   Solving this yields \\( n = 0 \\), which is invalid since \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( n^2 - n + 1 = 1 \\)**   \n   Rearranging gives us:\n   \\[\n   n^2 - n = 0 \\implies n(n - 1) = 0.\n   \\]\n   This results in \\( n = 0 \\) or \\( n = 1 \\), both of which are also invalid under our restriction \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n\n3. **Case 3: Both factors are greater than 1**  \n   Since neither \\( n + 1 \\) nor \\( n^2 - n + 1 \\) can equal 1 for \\( n \\geq 2 \\), it follows that \\( n^3 + 1 \\) cannot be prime when both factors are greater than 1.\n\n### Evaluating Small Values of \\( n \\)\nSince we have established that neither factor can equal 1, we can evaluate specific small values of \\( n \\) to see if \\( n^3 + 1 \\) is prime:\n\n- For \\( n = 2 \\):  \n  \\( n^3 + 1 = 9 \\) (not prime)\n\n- For \\( n = 3 \\):  \n  \\( n^3 + 1 = 28 \\) (not prime)\n\n- For \\( n = 4 \\):  \n  \\( n^3 + 1 = 65 \\) (not prime)\n\n- For \\( n = 5 \\):  \n  \\( n^3 + 1 = 126 \\) (not prime)\n\n- For \\( n = 6 \\):  \n  \\( n^3 + 1 = 217 \\) (not prime)\n\n- For \\( n = 7 \\):  \n  \\( n^3 + 1 = 344 \\) (not prime)\n\n- For \\( n = 8 \\):  \n  \\( n^3 + 1 = 513 \\) (not prime)\n\n- For \\( n = 9 \\):  \n  \\( n^3 + 1 = 730 \\) (not prime)\n\n- For \\( n = 10 \\):  \n  \\( n^3 + 1 = 1001 \\) (not prime)\n\nAfter checking values from \\( n = 2 \\) to \\( n = 10 \\), we consistently find that \\( n^3 + 1 \\) is not prime. Additionally, as \\( n \\) increases, \\( n^3 + 1 \\) becomes larger, and the factors \\( (n + 1) \\) and \\( (n^2 - n + 1) \\) will also increase, further indicating that \\( n^3 + 1 \\) is unlikely to be prime.\n\n### Conclusion\nWe conclude that there are no positive integers \\( n \\geq 2 \\) for which \\( 1001_n \\) is a prime number.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<ANSWER>0</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We see that the given number is equal to $1 \\cdot n^3 + 1 = n^3 + 1$. Using the sum of cubes factorization, it follows that $n^3 + 1 = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$. Since $1$ is a digit in the base, then $n > 1$, and $n+1 > 1$ and $n^2 - n + 1 > n - n + 1 = 1$, so $n^3 + 1$ is the product of two integers greater than $1$. Thus, $1001_n$ is prime for $\\boxed{0}$ values of $n$."
