  "solution": "To find the distance between points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we will follow these steps: determine the side lengths of the squares, establish the coordinates of the points, and calculate the distance.\n\n### Step 1: Side Length of the Smaller Square\nThe perimeter of the smaller square is \\(4\\) cm. The formula for the perimeter \\(P\\) of a square is:\n\\[\nP = 4 \\times \\text{side length}\n\\]\nLet \\(s\\) be the side length of the smaller square:\n\\[\n4 = 4s \\implies s = 1 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Side Length of the Larger Square\nThe area of the larger square is \\(16\\) cm\\(^2\\). The formula for the area \\(A\\) of a square is:\n\\[\nA = \\text{side length}^2\n\\]\nLet \\(S\\) be the side length of the larger square:\n\\[\n16 = S^2 \\implies S = 4 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Coordinates of Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\n- **Point \\(B\\)** is at the top-left corner of the smaller square, positioned at (0, 0). With a side length of \\(1\\) cm, the coordinates of point \\(B\\) are:\n\\[\nB(0, 1)\n\\]\n\n- **Point \\(A\\)** is at the top-right corner of the larger square. With a side length of \\(4\\) cm and its bottom-left corner at (0, 0), the coordinates of point \\(A\\) are:\n\\[\nA(4, 4)\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Distance from Point \\(A\\) to Point \\(B\\)\nWe use the distance formula:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\nSubstituting the coordinates \\(A(4, 4)\\) and \\(B(0, 1)\\):\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (4 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n### Alternative Approach: Right Triangle Visualization\nThe distance \\(AB\\) can also be visualized as the hypotenuse of a right triangle:\n- The horizontal leg (sum of the widths of the squares) is \\(1 + 4 = 5\\) cm.\n- The vertical leg (difference in height from \\(B\\) to \\(A\\)) is \\(4 - 1 = 3\\) cm.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{(5)^2 + (3)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 9} = \\sqrt{34} \\approx 5.831 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n### Final Result\nRounding \\(5.831\\) to the nearest tenth gives us:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} \\approx 5.8 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>5.8 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since the smaller square has a perimeter of 4 cm and its sides are equal in length, each side measures $4/4=1$ cm. Since the larger square has area 16 square cm, each side measures $\\sqrt{16}=4$ cm. To find the length of $AB$, we draw a right triangle with $AB$ as the hypotenuse and the two sides parallel to the sides of the squares, as shown below: [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(12,0));\ndraw((2,0)--(2,10));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,2));\ndraw((0,2)--(2,2));\ndraw((0,2)--(12,10));\ndraw((12,0)--(12,10));\ndraw((2,10)--(12,10));\ndraw((0,2)--(12,2)--(12,10),dashed);\nlabel(\"B\",(0,2),W);\nlabel(\"A\",(12,10),E);[/asy] The horizontal side has length $1+4=5$ (the length of the smaller square and the length of the larger square added together) and the vertical side has length $4-1=3$ (the length of the larger square minus the length of the smaller square). Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the length of $AB$ is $\\sqrt{5^2+3^2}=\\sqrt{34}\\approx\\boxed{5.8}$ cm."
