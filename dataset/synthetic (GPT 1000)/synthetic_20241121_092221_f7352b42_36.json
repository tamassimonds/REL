  "problem": "Many television screens are rectangles that are measured by the length of their diagonals. The ratio of the horizontal length to the height in a standard television screen is $4:3$. What is the horizontal length (in inches) of a ``27-inch'' television screen?\n\n[asy]\nfill((0,0)--(8,0)--(8,6)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(8,0)--(8,6)--(0,6)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(8,6),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"length\",(4,0),S);\nlabel(\"height\",(8,3),E);\nlabel(\"diagonal\",(4,3),NW);\n[/asy]",
  "solution": "To find the horizontal length (width) of a 27-inch television screen with a standard aspect ratio of \\(4:3\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Aspect Ratio Understanding**: The standard ratio of horizontal length (\\(L\\)) to height (\\(H\\)) is \\(4:3\\). Thus, we can express these dimensions as:\n   \\[\n   L = 4k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad H = 3k\n   \\]\n   where \\(k\\) is a common variable.\n\n2. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**: The diagonal (\\(D\\)) of the television can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   \\[\n   D^2 = L^2 + H^2\n   \\]\n   Given that the diagonal is 27 inches, we express this as:\n   \\[\n   27^2 = L^2 + H^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substituting Dimensions**: Substitute \\(L\\) and \\(H\\) with \\(4k\\) and \\(3k\\):\n   \\[\n   27^2 = (4k)^2 + (3k)^2\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   27^2 = 16k^2 + 9k^2 = 25k^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating \\(k^2\\)**: Calculate \\(27^2\\):\n   \\[\n   27^2 = 729\n   \\]\n   Therefore, substituting back:\n   \\[\n   729 = 25k^2\n   \\]\n   To find \\(k^2\\), divide both sides by 25:\n   \\[\n   k^2 = \\frac{729}{25}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding \\(k\\)**: Take the square root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   k = \\sqrt{\\frac{729}{25}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{729}}{\\sqrt{25}} = \\frac{27}{5}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculating Length \\(L\\)**: Finally, substitute \\(k\\) back into the equation for \\(L\\):\n   \\[\n   L = 4k = 4 \\times \\frac{27}{5} = \\frac{108}{5} = 21.6 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the horizontal length of the 27-inch television screen is:\n\n<ANSWER> 21.6 inches </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The height, length, and diagonal are in the ratio $3:4:5$. The length of the diagonal is 27, so the horizontal length is $\\frac{4}{5} (27) = \\boxed{21.6}$ inches."
