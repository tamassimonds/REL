  "problem": "In how many ways can a president and a 2-person committee be chosen from a group of 8 people (where the order in which we choose the 2 people doesn't matter)?  (The president cannot be on the committee.)",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of selecting a president and a committee of 2 people from a group of 8 individuals, where the president cannot be a member of the committee, we can follow this systematic approach:\n\n1. **Select the President**:\n   - We have 8 individuals available. We can choose any one of these 8 to be the president.\n   - Thus, there are 8 possible choices for the president.\n\n2. **Form the Committee**:\n   - After selecting the president, we cannot include that individual in the committee. This leaves us with 7 people from whom we can choose.\n   - We need to select 2 individuals from these remaining 7 to form the committee. The number of ways to choose 2 people from 7 is calculated using the combination formula:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n     \\]\n   - Specifically, we calculate:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, there are 21 ways to form the committee.\n\n3. **Combine the Choices**:\n   - To find the total number of different ways to select both a president and a committee, we multiply the number of choices for the president by the number of ways to select the committee:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Ways} = (\\text{Choices for President}) \\times (\\text{Choices for Committee}) = 8 \\times 21 = 168\n     \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the total number of ways to choose a president and a committee of 2 people from the group is:\n\n<ANSWER>168</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We have to first choose a president, and then we have to choose 2 people, but the order in which we choose the people doesn't matter. So first there are 8 ways to choose the president. Then there are 7 ways to choose the first person, and 6 ways to choose second person.  However, we have overcounted, since choosing person A first and person B second will give us the same committee as choosing person B first and person A second.  Each committee is counted twice in our original $7 \\times 6$ count, so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcount, giving us $8\\times(7 \\times 6)/2 = \\boxed{168}$ ways to choose a president and a 2-person committee from 8 people."
