  "problem": "Adam and Simon start on bicycle trips from the same point at the same time. Adam travels east at 8mph and Simon travels south at 6mph. After how many hours are they 60 miles apart?",
  "solution": "To determine when Adam and Simon are 60 miles apart, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem. Here's a clear and concise breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Calculate Distances Traveled Over Time:**\n   - Adam travels east at 8 mph, so after \\( t \\) hours, his distance \\( d_A \\) is:\n     \\[\n     d_A = 8t\n     \\]\n   - Simon travels south at 6 mph, giving him a distance \\( d_S \\) after \\( t \\) hours:\n     \\[\n     d_S = 6t\n     \\]\n\n2. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   Since Adam and Simon travel in perpendicular directions, we can find their distance \\( D \\) apart using:\n   \\[\n   D = \\sqrt{(d_A)^2 + (d_S)^2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting their distances:\n   \\[\n   D = \\sqrt{(8t)^2 + (6t)^2}\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   D = \\sqrt{64t^2 + 36t^2} = \\sqrt{100t^2} = 10t\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set Up the Distance Equation:**\n   To find when their distance is 60 miles, we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   10t = 60\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( t \\):**\n   Dividing both sides by 10 gives:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{60}{10} = 6\n   \\]\n\nThus, Adam and Simon will be 60 miles apart after 6 hours. \n\nFinal answer: <ANSWER>6 hours solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "If Adam travels east and Simon travels south, then their paths are perpendicular and their distance apart is the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Let $x$ be the number of hours it takes for Adam and Simon to be $60$ miles apart. Then Adam has traveled $8x$ miles and Simon has traveled $6x$ miles. By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have  \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(8x)^2+(6x)^2}&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n\\sqrt{100x^2}&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n10x&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nx&=6.\n\\end{align*}They are $60$ miles apart after $\\boxed{6}$ hours."
