  "problem": "Let $S_i$ be the set of all integers $n$ such that $100i\\leq n < 100(i + 1)$. For example, $S_4$ is the set ${400,401,402,\\ldots,499}$. How many of the sets $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{999}$ do not contain a perfect square?\n",
  "solution": "To determine how many sets \\( S_i \\) (for \\( i = 0, 1, \\ldots, 999 \\)) do not contain a perfect square, we can follow these structured steps:\n\n1. **Define the Sets**:  \n   Each set \\( S_i \\) comprises integers from \\( 100i \\) to \\( 100(i + 1) - 1 \\), which means each set contains exactly 100 integers:\n   \\[\n   S_i = \\{ 100i, 100i + 1, \\ldots, 100(i + 1) - 1 \\}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Locate Perfect Squares**:  \n   We identify the perfect squares \\( n^2 \\) within each set. To find the smallest perfect square, we determine \\( k \\) such that \\( k^2 \\geq 100i \\):\n   - This gives \\( k = \\lceil 10\\sqrt{i} \\rceil \\).\n   The largest perfect square is found by determining \\( m \\) such that \\( m^2 < 100(i + 1) \\):\n   - This yields \\( m = \\lfloor 10\\sqrt{i + 1} - 1 \\rfloor \\).\n\n3. **Condition for Absence of Perfect Squares**:  \n   For set \\( S_i \\) to lack perfect squares, we require \\( k > m \\). This implies that the lowest perfect square within the set exceeds the highest perfect square less than \\( 100(i + 1) \\).\n\n4. **Inequality Analysis**:  \n   We need to satisfy the inequality:\n   \\[\n   10\\sqrt{i} + 1 > 10\\sqrt{i + 1}\n   \\]\n   By simplification, we derive:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{i} + \\frac{1}{10} > \\sqrt{i + 1}\n   \\]\n   This leads to a quadratic inequality that provides bounds for \\( i \\).\n\n5. **Count Valid Sets**:  \n   - Sets \\( S_0 \\) to \\( S_{25} \\) will always contain at least one perfect square, as \\( 10^2 = 100 \\) is within these ranges.\n   - For \\( S_{26} \\) and onwards, we analyze how many sets remain free of perfect squares.\n\n6. **Final Count of Sets with Perfect Squares**:  \n   By calculating the perfect squares that fall within the relevant ranges, we find that there are 266 sets from \\( S_{26} \\) to \\( S_{999} \\) that do contain perfect squares, as \\( n^2 \\) for \\( n \\) from 51 to 316 fits this description.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:  \n   Ultimately, we compute the total sets without perfect squares:\n   \\[\n   1000 - (26 + 266) = 1000 - 292 = 708\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of sets \\( S_i \\) that do not contain a perfect square is:\n\n<ANSWER>708</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The difference between consecutive squares is $(x + 1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1$, which means that all squares above $50^2 = 2500$ are more than $100$ apart.\nThen the first $26$ sets ($S_0,\\cdots S_{25}$) each have at least one perfect square. Also, since $316^2 < 100000$ (which is when $i = 1000$), there are $316 - 50 = 266$ other sets after $S_{25}$ that have a perfect square.\nThere are $1000 - 266 - 26 = \\boxed{708}$ sets without a perfect square."
