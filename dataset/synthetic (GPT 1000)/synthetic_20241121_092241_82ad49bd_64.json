  "solution": "To determine the conditions under which the equation \n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x+B)(Ax+28)}{(x+C)(x+7)} = 2\n\\]\n\nhas infinitely many solutions for \\(x\\), we begin by cross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n(x+B)(Ax + 28) = 2(x+C)(x+7).\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand both sides of the equation.\n\n**Left Side Expansion:**\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[\n(x + B)(Ax + 28) = Ax^2 + 28x + ABx + 28B = Ax^2 + (AB + 28)x + 28B.\n\\]\n\n**Right Side Expansion:**\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n\\[\n2(x+C)(x+7) = 2(x^2 + (C+7)x + 7C) = 2x^2 + 2(C + 7)x + 14C.\n\\]\n\n**Equating Coefficients:**\n\nFor the equation to be true for infinitely many \\(x\\), the coefficients of like powers of \\(x\\) must be equal, leading to the following equations:\n\n1. \\(A = 2\\) (from the coefficient of \\(x^2\\)),\n2. \\(AB + 28 = 2(C + 7)\\) (from the coefficient of \\(x\\)),\n3. \\(28B = 14C\\) (from the constant terms).\n\n**Solving for Constants:**\n\nStarting with the first equation, we find \\(A = 2\\). \n\nUsing this in the third equation:\n\n\\[\n28B = 14C \\implies 2B = C.\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting \\(A = 2\\) and \\(C = 2B\\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\n2B + 28 = 2(2B + 7).\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right side yields:\n\n\\[\n2B + 28 = 4B + 14.\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n\\[\n28 - 14 = 4B - 2B \\implies 14 = 2B \\implies B = 7.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(B = 7\\) back into the equation for \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\nC = 2B = 2 \\times 7 = 14.\n\\]\n\nThus, the constants are:\n\n\\[\nA = 2, \\quad B = 7, \\quad C = 14.\n\\]\n\n**Identifying Non-Solutions:**\n\nNow, we analyze when the denominator of the original equation is undefined. The denominator is given by:\n\n\\[\n(x+C)(x+7) = (x + 14)(x + 7).\n\\]\n\nThis expression is undefined when:\n\n\\[\nx + 14 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -14,\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 7 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -7.\n\\]\n\n**Sum of Non-Solutions:**\n\nThe sum of these non-solution values is:\n\n\\[\n-14 + (-7) = -21.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer, encapsulating our findings, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-21}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "If the given equation is true, then multiplying by $(x+C)(x+7)$ gives the equation \\[(x+B)(Ax+28) = 2(x+C)(x+7),\\]which must also be true. (Note however, that the converse does not hold: that is, by multiplying by $(x+C)(x+7),$ we may have introduced extraneous roots.) Therefore, the above equation must also have infinitely many roots for $x.$ That is, the polynomials $(x+B)(Ax+28)$ and $2(x+C)(x+7)$ must agree for infinitely many values of $x.$ This means that they must be identical polynomials. (In general, if $p(x) = q(x)$ for infinitely many $x,$ then $p(x) - q(x) = 0$ has infinitely many roots, which is only possible if $p(x) - q(x)$ is identically the zero polynomial.)\n\nThis means that \\[(x+B)(Ax+28) = 2(x+C)(x+7)\\]for all $x.$ Expanding both sides, we get \\[Ax^2 + (AB+28)x + 28B = 2x^2 + (2C+14)x + 14C.\\]Corresponding coefficients of both sides must be equal, so we have \\[\\begin{aligned} A &= 2, \\\\ AB+28 &= 2C+14, \\\\ 28B &= 14C. \\end{aligned}\\]From the first and third equations, $A=2$ and $C=2B.$ Then substituting into the second equation gives \\[2B+28 = 4B+14,\\]so $B=7,$ and then $C=14.$ This means that our original equation was \\[\\frac{(x+7)(2x+28)}{(x+14)(x+7)} = 2.\\]This equation holds whenever the denominator is nonzero. The denominator is equal to zero when $x=-7$ and $x=-14,$ so the sum of the values of $x$ which are not roots of the original equation is $(-7)+(-14) = \\boxed{-21}.$"
