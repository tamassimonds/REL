  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were brainstorming on paper. I\u2019ll explore different strategies, check my work frequently, and make adjustments as needed to ensure the final answer is correct. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Okay, I need to evaluate this infinite geometric series:  \n  \\(\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{8}{27} - \\frac{32}{243} + \\dots\\)\n\n- It's an infinite series with alternating positive and negative terms. It **looks** like a geometric series because the ratios between terms seem consistent.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- My initial instinct is to determine if there's a common ratio between consecutive terms. If it is a geometric series, I can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series.\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- But wait, I should **verify** that it really is a geometric series before jumping to conclusions. Maybe there's another pattern? It's important to confirm the series type to apply the right formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Common Ratio**\n\n**Strategy 1: Check the Ratio Between Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To confirm it's a geometric series, I need to find the ratio (\\(r\\)) between consecutive terms. If \\(r\\) is consistent, then it's geometric.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **First Term (\\(a_1\\)):** \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\)  \n- **Second Term (\\(a_2\\)):** \\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{-\\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{3}{2}} = -\\frac{4}{9}\n  \\]\n\n**Checking Consistency:**\n\n- Let's verify by calculating the ratio for the next pair of terms:\n\n  - **Third Term (\\(a_3\\)):** \\(\\frac{8}{27}\\)\n  \n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{27}}{-\\frac{2}{3}} = -\\frac{4}{9}\n  \\]\n\n- **Observation:** The ratio is consistent at \\(-\\frac{4}{9}\\). So, we **do** have a common ratio.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This consistency confirms that it's a geometric series with a common ratio of \\(-\\frac{4}{9}\\). **Phew! That's good to know.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Infinite Geometric Series Formula**\n\n**Strategy 2: Use the Sum Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that I know it's a geometric series, I can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:\n\n  \\[\n  S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\n  \\]\n\n  Where:\n  - \\(S\\) is the sum of the series,\n  - \\(a\\) is the first term (\\(\\frac{3}{2}\\)),\n  - \\(r\\) is the common ratio (\\(-\\frac{4}{9}\\)).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Plug the values into the formula:\n\n  \\[\n  S = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{1 - \\left(-\\frac{4}{9}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{1 + \\frac{4}{9}}\n  \\]\n\n- Simplify the denominator:\n\n  \\[\n  1 + \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{9}{9} + \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{13}{9}\n  \\]\n\n- So, the sum becomes:\n\n  \\[\n  S = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{\\frac{13}{9}} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{9}{13} = \\frac{27}{26}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait, let me double-check that calculation.** Does \\(\\frac{27}{26}\\) make sense? Considering that the terms are alternating and decreasing in magnitude, a sum slightly greater than 1 seems plausible.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Strategy 3: Approximate the Sum by Adding the First Few Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To ensure correctness, I'll approximate the sum by adding the first few terms manually and see if it approaches \\(\\frac{27}{26}\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **First Term:**  \n  \\(\\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\\)\n\n- **Second Term:**  \n  \\(1.5 - \\frac{2}{3} = 1.5 - 0.6667 \\approx 0.8333\\)\n\n- **Third Term:**  \n  \\(0.8333 + \\frac{8}{27} \\approx 0.8333 + 0.2963 \\approx 1.1296\\)\n\n- **Fourth Term:**  \n  \\(1.1296 - \\frac{32}{243} \\approx 1.1296 - 0.1317 \\approx 0.9979\\)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **Hmm, interesting.** Adding the first few terms brings the sum close to 1, which aligns with our calculated sum of \\(\\frac{27}{26} \\approx 1.0385\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This approximation supports the earlier calculation. **Looks like we're on the right track!**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- The absolute value of the common ratio is less than 1 (\\(\\left|-\\frac{4}{9}\\right| = \\frac{4}{9} < 1\\)), which is essential for the convergence of an infinite geometric series. **So, the series converges.**\n\n- Both the formula application and the manual approximation agree on the sum being around \\(\\frac{27}{26}\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- After exploring different strategies, verifying the common ratio, applying the infinite series formula, and cross-checking with a manual sum approximation, I'm confident in the solution.\n\n<ANSWER>\n**Solution:**  \n\\[\\sum = \\frac{27}{26}\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Did I explore multiple strategies?**  \n  Yes, I started by identifying the common ratio, then applied the sum formula, and finally verified the result with a manual approximation.\n\n- **Did I check my work along the way?**  \n  Absolutely, I double-checked the ratio consistency, confirmed the formula application, and used an approximation to ensure correctness.\n\n- **Did I adjust my approach when necessary?**  \n  Initially, I wasn't certain if it was a geometric series, so I verified the common ratio before proceeding with the formula.\n\n- **Is the final answer intuitive?**  \n  Given the alternating and diminishing terms, a sum slightly greater than 1 makes sense.\n\n- **Am I confident in the solution?**  \n  Yes, multiple checks confirm that \\(\\sum = \\frac{27}{26}\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem systematically, reflecting frequently, and verifying each step, I've ensured the accuracy of the final solution.",
  "ground_truth": "The series has first term $\\frac{3}{2}$ and common ratio $\\frac{-4}{9}$, so the formula yields: $\\cfrac{\\frac{3}{2}}{1-\\left(\\frac{-4}{9}\\right)}=\\boxed{\\frac{27}{26}}$."
