  "problem": "A point whose coordinates are both integers is called a lattice point. How many lattice points lie on the hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$?\n",
  "solution": "To determine the number of lattice points on the hyperbola defined by the equation \\( x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearranging the Equation**: We start by factoring the left-hand side:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) = 2000^2.\n   \\]\n   Let\u2019s denote \\( a = x - y \\) and \\( b = x + y \\), leading to:\n   \\[\n   ab = 2000^2.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identifying the Parities**: For \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to be integers, both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must have the same parity. Since \\( 2000^2 \\) is even, both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must also be even.\n\n3. **Factoring Out 2**: We express \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as:\n   \\[\n   a = 2m \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = 2n.\n   \\]\n   Substituting these into the equation yields:\n   \\[\n   (2m)(2n) = 2000^2 \\Rightarrow 4mn = 2000^2 \\Rightarrow mn = \\frac{2000^2}{4} = 1000^2.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding the Prime Factorization**: Next, we factor \\( 1000^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   1000 = 10^3 = (2 \\times 5)^3 = 2^3 \\times 5^3,\n   \\]\n   thus,\n   \\[\n   1000^2 = (2^3 \\times 5^3)^2 = 2^6 \\times 5^6.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Counting the Factors**: To find the number of factors of \\( 1000^2 = 2^6 \\times 5^6 \\), we apply the formula:\n   \\[\n   (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) = (6 + 1)(6 + 1) = 7 \\times 7 = 49.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Mapping Factors to Lattice Points**: Each factor pair \\( (m, n) \\) corresponds to a unique pair \\( (x, y) \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{a + b}{2} = m + n,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{b - a}{2} = n - m.\n   \\]\n   Each positive pair \\( (m, n) \\) produces a unique \\( (x, y) \\), but we must consider both the positive and negative values for \\( y \\).\n\n7. **Including Negative Values**: Since \\( y \\) can take on both positive and negative values for each pair \\( (m, n) \\), the total number of lattice points is:\n   \\[\n   49 \\text{ pairs of } (m, n) \\times 2 \\text{ (for both signs of } y) = 98.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of lattice points on the hyperbola \\( x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2 \\) is:\n\\[\n\\text{The number of lattice points is } \\boxed{98}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "\\[(x-y)(x+y)=2000^2=2^8 \\cdot 5^6\\]\nNote that $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$ have the same parities, so both must be even. We first give a factor of $2$ to both $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$. We have $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$ left. Since there are $7 \\cdot 7=49$ factors of $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$, and since both $x$ and $y$ can be negative, this gives us $49\\cdot2=\\boxed{98}$ lattice points."
