  "problem": "When the length of a rectangle is increased by $20\\%$ and the width increased by $10\\%$, by what percent is the area increased?",
  "solution": "To determine the percent increase in the area of a rectangle when both its length and width are increased, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Variables**:\n   Let the original length be \\( L \\) and the original width be \\( W \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Original Area**:\n   The original area, denoted as \\( A_{original} \\), is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   A_{original} = L \\times W\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the Increases**:\n   - The length is increased by \\( 20\\% \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{New Length} = L + 0.20L = 1.20L\n     \\]\n   - The width is increased by \\( 10\\% \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{New Width} = W + 0.10W = 1.10W\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the New Area**:\n   The new area, \\( A_{new} \\), is given by:\n   \\[\n   A_{new} = \\text{New Length} \\times \\text{New Width} = (1.20L) \\times (1.10W) = 1.32(L \\times W)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the Increase in Area**:\n   The increase in area is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increase in Area} = A_{new} - A_{original} = 1.32(L \\times W) - (L \\times W) = (1.32 - 1)(L \\times W) = 0.32(L \\times W)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the Percent Increase**:\n   The percent increase in area is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percent Increase} = \\left(\\frac{0.32(L \\times W)}{L \\times W}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 0.32 \\times 100\\% = 32\\%\n   \\]\n\nIn summary, the area of the rectangle increases by **32%** after the changes in length and width. \n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>32%</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "If we let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$, then the original area of the rectangle is $lw$. The length is then increased $20\\%$ to $1.2l$ and the width is increased $10\\%$ to $1.1w$, so the new area is $(1.2l)(1.1w)=1.32lw$. There new area is $132\\%$ the old area, which represents a change of $\\boxed{32 \\%}$."
