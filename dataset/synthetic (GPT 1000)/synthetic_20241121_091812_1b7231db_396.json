  "problem": "Kevin Kangaroo begins hopping on a number line at 0. He wants to get to 1, but he can hop only $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the distance. Each hop tires him out so that he continues to hop $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining distance. How far has he hopped after five hops? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To determine the total distance Kevin Kangaroo has hopped after five hops, we can break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Kevin begins at position 0 and aims to reach position 1. Each hop covers \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the remaining distance to his target.\n\n2. **Hopping Breakdown**:\n   - **First Hop**:\n     - Remaining distance to 1: \\(1 - 0 = 1\\)\n     - Distance covered: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n     - New position: \\(0 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n\n   - **Second Hop**:\n     - Remaining distance: \\(1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\)\n     - Distance covered: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{9}\\)\n     - New position: \\(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}\\)\n\n   - **Third Hop**:\n     - Remaining distance: \\(1 - \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{4}{9}\\)\n     - Distance covered: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{4}{27}\\)\n     - New position: \\(\\frac{5}{9} + \\frac{4}{27} = \\frac{19}{27}\\)\n\n   - **Fourth Hop**:\n     - Remaining distance: \\(1 - \\frac{19}{27} = \\frac{8}{27}\\)\n     - Distance covered: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{8}{81}\\)\n     - New position: \\(\\frac{19}{27} + \\frac{8}{81} = \\frac{65}{81}\\)\n\n   - **Fifth Hop**:\n     - Remaining distance: \\(1 - \\frac{65}{81} = \\frac{16}{81}\\)\n     - Distance covered: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{16}{81} = \\frac{16}{243}\\)\n     - New position: \\(\\frac{65}{81} + \\frac{16}{243} = \\frac{211}{243}\\)\n\n3. **Total Distance Hopped**:\n   - We add up the distances from each hop:\n     - First hop: \\(\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{81}{243}\\)\n     - Second hop: \\(\\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{54}{243}\\)\n     - Third hop: \\(\\frac{4}{27} = \\frac{36}{243}\\)\n     - Fourth hop: \\(\\frac{8}{81} = \\frac{24}{243}\\)\n     - Fifth hop: \\(\\frac{16}{243}\\)\n\n   Thus, the total distance hopped is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{81}{243} + \\frac{54}{243} + \\frac{36}{243} + \\frac{24}{243} + \\frac{16}{243} = \\frac{211}{243}\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, after five hops, Kevin has hopped a total distance of \\(\\frac{211}{243}\\).\n\nThus, the answer is: \n\n\\(\\frac{211}{243}\\)",
  "ground_truth": "Kevin hops $1/3$ of the remaining distance with every hop. His first hop takes $1/3$ closer. For his second hop, he has $2/3$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)(1/3)$. For his third hop, he has $(2/3)^2$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)^2(1/3)$. In general, Kevin hops forward $(2/3)^{k-1}(1/3)$ on his $k$th hop. We want to find how far he has hopped after five hops. This is a finite geometric series with first term $1/3$, common ratio $2/3$, and five terms. Thus, Kevin has hopped $\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5\\right)}{1-\\frac{2}{3}} = \\boxed{\\frac{211}{243}}$."
