  "problem": "There are 8 sprinters in the Olympic 100-meter finals. Three of the sprinters are Americans.  The gold medal goes to first place, silver to second, and bronze to third.   In how many ways can the medals be awarded if at most one American gets a medal?",
  "solution": "To determine how many ways medals can be awarded to sprinters with the condition that at most one American receives a medal, we evaluate two specific scenarios: \n\n1. **No Americans win medals.**\n2. **Exactly one American wins a medal.**\n\n### Scenario 1: No Americans Win Medals\n\nIf no Americans win medals, all three medals must go to non-American sprinters. There are 8 sprinters in total, with 5 being non-Americans.\n\nTo assign the medals:\n- The gold medal can be awarded to any of the 5 non-Americans.\n- The silver medal can then go to any of the remaining 4 non-Americans.\n- Finally, the bronze medal can be awarded to any of the 3 remaining non-Americans.\n\nThus, the total number of ways to distribute the medals among the non-Americans is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 4 \\times 3 = 60\n\\]\n\n### Scenario 2: Exactly One American Wins a Medal\n\nIn this scenario, we need to:\n1. Select 1 American to receive a medal.\n2. Select 2 non-Americans to receive the remaining medals.\n3. Arrange how these three medalists will receive the gold, silver, and bronze.\n\n1. **Choosing 1 American:**\n   We have 3 Americans, so there are \\( \\binom{3}{1} = 3 \\) ways to select one.\n\n2. **Choosing 2 non-Americans:**\n   From 5 non-Americans, we can choose 2 in \\( \\binom{5}{2} = 10 \\) ways.\n\n3. **Arranging the medals:**\n   With 1 American and 2 non-Americans selected, we can arrange these 3 medalists in \\( 3! = 6 \\) ways.\n\nCombining these choices gives us the total number of arrangements for this scenario:\n\\[\n\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{5}{2} \\times 3! = 3 \\times 10 \\times 6 = 180\n\\]\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nNow, we sum the results from both scenarios to find the total number of ways medals can be awarded under the constraint that at most one American receives a medal:\n- Ways with no Americans winning medals: 60\n- Ways with exactly one American winning a medal: 180\n\nThus, the total number of ways to award the medals is:\n\\[\n60 + 180 = 240\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe total number of ways to award the medals, ensuring that at most one American receives a medal, is **240**.",
  "ground_truth": "Consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: No Americans get a medal. So there are 5 choices for the gold medal, 4 choices for the silver, and 3 choices for bronze, which is $5\\times4\\times3=60$ ways.\n\nCase 2: One American gets a medal. There are 3 Americans to choose from. After we choose which American to get the medal, we have to decide which medal to reward the American, for which we have 3 choices. Then we have 5 choices for one of the remaining medal and 4 choices for the last medal. So, we have a total of $3\\times3\\times5\\times4=180$ ways.\n\nSum up the two cases, and we have a total of $180+60=\\boxed{240}$ ways."
