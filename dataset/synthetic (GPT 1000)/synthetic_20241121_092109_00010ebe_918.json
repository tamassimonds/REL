  "problem": "For $1 \\le n \\le 100$, how many integers are there such that $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is a repeating decimal?",
  "solution": "To find how many integers \\( n \\) exist for \\( 1 \\le n \\le 100 \\) such that \\( \\frac{n}{n+1} \\) is a repeating decimal, we need to examine the conditions that make a fraction a repeating decimal.\n\n### Key Concept:\nA fraction \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) can be expressed as a repeating decimal if, after simplification, its denominator \\( b \\) has any prime factors other than 2 and 5. If the denominator consists solely of these primes, the fraction is a terminating decimal.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the fraction**: \n   We consider the fraction \\( \\frac{n}{n+1} \\) \u2014 here, the denominator is \\( n + 1 \\).\n\n2. **Focus on the denominator**: \n   We analyze \\( n + 1 \\) for values of \\( n \\) ranging from 1 to 100, which means \\( n + 1 \\) ranges from 2 to 101.\n\n3. **Condition for repetition**: \n   \\( \\frac{n}{n + 1} \\) will be a repeating decimal if \\( n + 1 \\) contains prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\n4. **Listing numbers**:\n   We need to identify all integers between 2 and 101 that can be written in the form \\( 2^a \\cdot 5^b \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are non-negative integers. These numbers will indicate non-repeating decimals:\n\n   - For \\( a = 0 \\): \\( b = 0 \\) (1), \\( b = 1 \\) (5), \\( b = 2 \\) (25):\n     - Numbers: 1, 5, 25\n   - For \\( a = 1 \\): \\( b = 0 \\) (2), \\( b = 1 \\) (10), \\( b = 2 \\) (50):\n     - Numbers: 2, 10, 50\n   - For \\( a = 2 \\): \\( b = 0 \\) (4), \\( b = 1 \\) (20):\n     - Numbers: 4, 20\n   - For \\( a = 3 \\): \\( b = 0 \\) (8), \\( b = 1 \\) (40):\n     - Numbers: 8, 40\n   - For \\( a = 4 \\): \\( b = 0 \\) (16), \\( b = 1 \\) (80):\n     - Numbers: 16, 80\n   - For \\( a = 5 \\): \\( b = 0 \\) (32):\n     - Number: 32\n   - For \\( a = 6 \\): \\( b = 0 \\) (64):\n     - Number: 64\n\n   The complete list of valid numbers up to 101 that are either powers of 2 or 5 is:\n   \\( 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 64, 80 \\).\n\n5. **Count these numbers**:\n   There are a total of 14 numbers in this category.\n\n6. **Calculate repeating decimal occurrences**:\n   The total integers from 2 to 101 equal 100. Non-repeating decimal cases total 14.\n   Thus, the number of integers \\( n \\) such that \\( \\frac{n}{n + 1} \\) is a repeating decimal is:\n   \\[\n   100 - 14 = 86.\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe number of integers \\( n \\) such that \\( \\frac{n}{n + 1} \\) is a repeating decimal for \\( 1 \\le n \\le 100 \\) is **86**.",
  "ground_truth": "Note that $n+1$ and $n$ will never share any common factors except for $1$, because they are consecutive integers. Therefore, $n/(n+1)$ is already simplified, for all positive integers $n$.\n\nSince $1 \\le n \\le 100$, it follows that $2 \\le n+1 \\le 101$. Recall that a simplified fraction has a repeating decimal representation if and only if its denominator is divisible by a prime other than 2 and 5. The numbers between 2 and 101 which are divisible only by 2 and 5 comprise the set $\\{2, 4, 5, 8, \\allowbreak 10, 16, 20, 25, \\allowbreak 32, 40, 50, 64, \\allowbreak 80, 100\\}$. Therefore, there are $14$ terminating decimals and $100 - 14 = \\boxed{86}$ repeating decimals."
