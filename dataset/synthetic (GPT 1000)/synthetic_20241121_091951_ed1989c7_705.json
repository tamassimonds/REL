  "solution": "To determine which positive integer values of \\( k \\) allow the quadratic equation \\( kx^2 + 20x + k = 0 \\) to have rational solutions, we analyze its discriminant.\n\nThe discriminant \\( D \\) of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nFor our specific equation:\n\n- \\( a = k \\)\n- \\( b = 20 \\)\n- \\( c = k \\)\n\nSubstituting these values into the discriminant formula, we get:\n\n\\[\nD = 20^2 - 4(k)(k) = 400 - 4k^2\n\\]\n\nFor the quadratic to have rational solutions, \\( D \\) must be a perfect square. Therefore, we require:\n\n\\[\n400 - 4k^2 \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n400 \\geq 4k^2\n\\]\n\nDividing the entire inequality by 4 results in:\n\n\\[\n100 \\geq k^2\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\n\n\\[\n|k| \\leq 10\n\\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) is a positive integer, this leads to:\n\n\\[\n1 \\leq k \\leq 10\n\\]\n\nNext, to ensure the discriminant is a perfect square, we set \\( D = m^2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\):\n\n\\[\n400 - 4k^2 = m^2\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us:\n\n\\[\n4k^2 + m^2 = 400\n\\]\n\nThis equation indicates that \\( m \\) must be even (since \\( 400 \\) is even), so we let \\( m = 2n \\) for some integer \\( n \\). Substituting this in gives:\n\n\\[\n4k^2 + (2n)^2 = 400\n\\]\n\nSimplifying results in:\n\n\\[\n4k^2 + 4n^2 = 400\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4 yields:\n\n\\[\nk^2 + n^2 = 100\n\\]\n\nTo find pairs of positive integers \\( (k, n) \\) that satisfy this equation, we can rewrite it as:\n\n\\[\nn^2 = 100 - k^2\n\\]\n\nWe need \\( 100 - k^2 \\) to be non-negative, which implies:\n\n\\[\nk^2 \\leq 100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 1 \\leq k \\leq 10\n\\]\n\nNext, we check which values of \\( k \\) result in \\( n^2 \\) being a perfect square:\n\n- For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( n^2 = 100 - 1^2 = 99\\) (not a perfect square)\n- For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( n^2 = 100 - 2^2 = 96\\) (not a perfect square)\n- For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( n^2 = 100 - 3^2 = 91\\) (not a perfect square)\n- For \\( k = 4 \\): \\( n^2 = 100 - 4^2 = 84\\) (not a perfect square)\n- For \\( k = 5 \\): \\( n^2 = 100 - 5^2 = 75\\) (not a perfect square)\n- For \\( k = 6 \\): \\( n^2 = 100 - 6^2 = 64\\) (a perfect square, \\( n = 8\\))\n- For \\( k = 7 \\): \\( n^2 = 100 - 7^2 = 51\\) (not a perfect square)\n- For \\( k = 8 \\): \\( n^2 = 100 - 8^2 = 36\\) (a perfect square, \\( n = 6\\))\n- For \\( k = 9 \\): \\( n^2 = 100 - 9^2 = 19\\) (not a perfect square)\n- For \\( k = 10 \\): \\( n^2 = 100 - 10^2 = 0\\) (a perfect square, \\( n = 0\\))\n\nThe values of \\( k \\) that yield \\( n^2 \\) as a perfect square are \\( k = 6, 8, 10 \\).\n\nIn conclusion, the positive integer values of \\( k \\) that allow the quadratic equation to have rational solutions are:\n\n<ANSWER>6,8,10</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "By considering the expression $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the solutions of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we find that the solutions are rational if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ has a rational square root. Therefore, the solutions of $kx^2+20x+k=0$ are rational if and only if $400-4(k)(k)$ is a perfect square. (Recall that if $n$ is an integer which is not a perfect square, then $\\sqrt{n}$ is irrational).  By writing the discriminant as $4(100-k^2)$, we see that we only need to check the integers $1\\leq k\\leq 10$.  Of these, $\\boxed{6, 8\\text{, and }10}$ work."
