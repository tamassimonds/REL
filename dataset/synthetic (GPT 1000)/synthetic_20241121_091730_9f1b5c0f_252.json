  "problem": "Janice bought 30 items each priced at 30 cents, 2 dollars, or 3 dollars. If her total purchase price was $\\$$30.00, how many 30-cent items did she purchase?",
  "solution": "Let's tackle the problem step by step and summarize the solution clearly.\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of 30-cent items.\n   - Let \\( y \\) be the number of 2-dollar items.\n   - Let \\( z \\) be the number of 3-dollar items.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equations:**\n   - From the problem, Janice bought a total of 30 items:\n     \\[\n     x + y + z = 30 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n     \\]\n   - The total purchase price was $30.00, or 3000 cents:\n     \\[\n     30x + 200y + 300z = 3000 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Cost Equation:**\n   - Dividing Equation 2 by 10 results in:\n     \\[\n     3x + 20y + 30z = 300 \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Substitute and Rearrange:**\n   - From Equation 1, express \\( z \\):\n     \\[\n     z = 30 - x - y\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( z \\) into Equation 3:\n     \\[\n     3x + 20y + 30(30 - x - y) = 300\n     \\]\n   - Expanding this gives:\n     \\[\n     3x + 20y + 900 - 30x - 30y = 300\n     \\]\n   - Combine like terms to get:\n     \\[\n     -27x - 10y + 900 = 300\n     \\]\n   - Rearranging leads to:\n     \\[\n     27x + 10y = 600 \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve the System of Equations:**\n   - We now have:\n     \\[\n     x + y + z = 30 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     27x + 10y = 600 \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)}\n     \\]\n   - Rearranging Equation 4, we isolate \\( y \\):\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{600 - 27x}{10}\n     \\]\n   \n6. **Substitute into Equation 1:**\n   - Substitute for \\( y \\) in Equation 1:\n     \\[\n     z = 30 - x - \\frac{600 - 27x}{10}\n     \\]\n   - Combines under a common denominator:\n     \\[\n     z = 30 - x - 60 + 2.7x = 1.7x - 30\n     \\]\n   - To ensure \\( z \\) is a non-negative integer, we derive:\n     \\[\n     1.7x - 30 \\geq 0 \\implies x \\geq \\frac{30}{1.7} \\approx 17.65,\n     \\]\n     so \\( x \\) must be at least 18.\n\n7. **Testing Integer Values:**\n   - Testing integers starting from \\( x = 18 \\):\n     - \\( x = 18 \\) yields \\( y \\) as non-integer.\n     - \\( x = 19 \\) yields \\( y \\) as non-integer.\n     - Testing \\( x = 20 \\):\n       \\[\n       y = \\frac{600 - 27 \\cdot 20}{10} = 6 \\text{ (integer)},\n       \\]\n       and substituting back gives:\n       \\[\n       z = 30 - 20 - 6 = 4.\n       \\]\n\n8. **Solution Verification:**\n   - Total items:\n     \\[\n     20 + 6 + 4 = 30\n     \\]\n   - Total cost:\n     \\[\n     30 \\cdot 20 + 200 \\cdot 6 + 300 \\cdot 4 = 600 + 1200 + 1200 = 3000 \\text{ cents (or \\$30.00)}.\n     \\]\n\nThe final conclusion is that Janice purchased **20** 30-cent items, **6** 2-dollar items, and **4** 3-dollar items. \n\nThus, the number of 30-cent items purchased by Janice is:\n\n<ANSWER>20</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let $a,b,c$ be the number of 30 cent items, 2 dollar items, and 3 dollar items that Janice bought, respectively. Since there are 30 items in all, $a+b+c = 30$. The total cost is 3000 cents, so $30a+200b+300c = 3000$, which can be rewritten as \\begin{align*}\n30a+(30b+170b)+(30c+270c) &= 3000\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 30(a+b+c) + 170b+270c &= 3000.\n\\end{align*}  Substituting $a+b+c = 30$ gives \\begin{align*}\n30\\cdot30 + 170b+270c &=3000\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 170b+270c &= 2100\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 17b+27c &= 210.\n\\end{align*} Thus, $17b+27c$ is a multiple of 10. Since $17b+27c = 10(b+2c) + 7(b+c)$, $7(b+c)$ is also a multiple of 10. 10 cannot divide 7, so 10 divides $b+c$. Janice bought 30 items, so the reasonable values of $b+c$ are $0, 10, 20, 30$. If $b+c = 0$, then $17b+27c = 0$, which isn't true. If $b+c=20$, then the least possible value of $17b+27c$ is $17\\cdot20 = 340$, which is also impossible. By the same reasoning $b+c=30$ is also impossible. We conclude that $b+c= 10$, namely that $b=6$ and $c=4$ to satisfy $17b+27c = 210$. Thus $a = 30-(b+c) = \\boxed{20}$."
