  "problem": "Any five points are taken inside or on a square with side length $1$. Let a be the smallest possible number with the property that it is always possible to select one pair of points from these five such that the distance between them is equal to or less than $a$. Then $a$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\sqrt{3}/3\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\sqrt{2}/2\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 2\\sqrt{2}/3\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 1 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\sqrt{2}$\n",
  "solution": "To determine the value of \\( a \\) such that among any five points placed inside or on a square of side length \\( 1 \\), there exists at least one pair of points whose distance is less than or equal to \\( a \\), we can use the pigeonhole principle as follows:\n\n1. **Divide the Square**: We start by dividing the \\( 1 \\times 1 \\) square into \\( 4 \\) smaller squares, each measuring \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\). This results in the following layout:\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n   \\hline\n   (0, 0) & (0.5, 0) \\\\\n   \\hline\n   (0, 0.5) & (0.5, 0.5) \\\\\n   \\hline\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Maximum Distance Within a Smaller Square**: The diagonal distance \\( d \\) of a smaller square with side length \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, the maximum distance between any two points within the same \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\) square is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Apply the Pigeonhole Principle**: By applying the pigeonhole principle, when placing \\( 5 \\) points into \\( 4 \\) smaller squares, at least one smaller square must contain at least \\( 2 \\) points. Since these two points are in the same smaller square, their distance must be less than or equal to \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the maximum guaranteed distance \\( a \\) such that we can find a pair of points within the square that are at most \\( a \\) apart is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}.\n\\] \n\nThis solution utilizes both geometric properties and combinatorial reasoning to arrive at the conclusion effectively.",
  "ground_truth": "Partition the unit square into four smaller squares of sidelength $\\frac{1}{2}$. Each of the five points lies in one of these squares, and so by the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists two points in the same $\\frac{1}{2}\\times \\frac{1}{2}$ square - the maximum possible distance between them being $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}$ by Pythagoras."
