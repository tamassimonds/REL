  "solution": "Absolutely, let's seamlessly integrate the brainstorming, reflection, and calculations into a coherent and complete solution, ensuring clarity and precision throughout the process.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWe need to find the intersection points of two parabolas:\n\n- \\( y = 3x^2 + 4x - 5 \\)\n- \\( y = x^2 + 11 \\)\n\nThe goal is to determine all points where these parabolas intersect and list them in ascending order of \\( x \\)-coordinates.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Intersection Points:** Points of intersection occur where both equations have the same \\( y \\) value for the same \\( x \\). This suggests setting the equations equal to each other.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Set the Equations Equal:** Solve \\( 3x^2 + 4x - 5 = x^2 + 11 \\).\n  2. **Graphical Visualization:** Sketching the parabolas could provide an approximate idea of the intersection points.\n  3. **Algebraic Methods:** Use substitution or elimination, though setting the equations equal seems straightforward here.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nI'll **set the two equations equal** to each other to find the exact \\( x \\)-coordinates of the intersection points. If this approach encounters difficulties, I can consider alternative methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting the Equations Equal**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBy equating the two expressions for \\( y \\), I can eliminate \\( y \\) and derive an equation solely in terms of \\( x \\). This will help identify the \\( x \\)-coordinates where the parabolas intersect.\n\n**Writing It Out:**\n\nSet the equations equal:\n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 4x - 5 = x^2 + 11\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Setup:**\n\n- Does this approach make sense? Yes, because at the points of intersection, both equations must yield the same \\( y \\) for a given \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Equation**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to consolidate all terms on one side to form a standard quadratic equation. This step is crucial for applying factoring or the quadratic formula later.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Subtract \\( x^2 \\) from both sides:**\n   \\[\n   3x^2 - x^2 + 4x - 5 = 11\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 4x - 5 = 11\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract 11 from both sides:**\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 4x - 5 - 11 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 4x - 16 = 0\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Is the equation correctly simplified? Yes, by combining like terms, I've reduced the equation to a standard quadratic form.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the \\( x \\)-coordinates, I need to solve \\( 2x^2 + 4x - 16 = 0 \\). Possible methods include factoring, using the quadratic formula, or completing the square.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n- **Factoring:** Attempt to factor the quadratic equation.\n- **Quadratic Formula:** If factoring is challenging, apply \\( x = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a} \\).\n- **Completing the Square:** As a last resort, though it might be more cumbersome.\n\n**Attempting to Factor:**\n\n- **Factoring Out Common Terms:**\n\n  First, factor out a 2:\n  \\[\n  2(x^2 + 2x - 8) = 0\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **Looking for Factors:**\n\n  Find two numbers that multiply to \\(-8\\) and add to \\(2\\).\n  \n  - Possible pairs: \\( (4, -2) \\) since \\( 4 \\times (-2) = -8 \\) and \\( 4 + (-2) = 2 \\).\n\n**Factoring the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n(x + 4)(x - 2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Does factoring work? Yes, because expanding \\( (x + 4)(x - 2) \\) yields \\( x^2 + 2x - 8 \\).\n\n**Checking Work:**\n\n- Quick verification:\n  - \\( (x + 4)(x - 2) = 0 \\)\n  - Roots are \\( x = -4 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the \\( x \\)-Coordinates**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe factored equation provides the \\( x \\)-coordinates where the parabolas intersect.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nSet each factor to zero:\n\n\\[\nx + 4 = 0 \\implies x = -4\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\implies x = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Are these solutions correct? Yes, factoring successfully yielded two distinct \\( x \\)-values.\n- But wait, it's essential to **double-check** by substituting these \\( x \\)-values back into the original equations to ensure they produce the same \\( y \\)-coordinates.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Solutions**\n\n---\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo confirm the validity of \\( x = -4 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\), I'll substitute them into both original equations and verify that the resulting \\( y \\)-values are identical.\n\n---\n\n**Substituting \\( x = -4 \\):**\n\n1. **First Equation:**\n   \\[\n   y = 3(-4)^2 + 4(-4) - 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 3(16) - 16 - 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 48 - 16 - 5 = 27\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 27\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Equation:**\n   \\[\n   y = (-4)^2 + 11\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 16 + 11 = 27\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 27\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- For \\( x = -4 \\), both equations yield \\( y = 27 \\). **This confirms that \\((-4, 27)\\) is indeed an intersection point.**\n\n---\n\n**Substituting \\( x = 2 \\):**\n\n1. **First Equation:**\n   \\[\n   y = 3(2)^2 + 4(2) - 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 3(4) + 8 - 5\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 12 + 8 - 5 = 15\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Equation:**\n   \\[\n   y = (2)^2 + 11\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 4 + 11 = 15\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 15\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- For \\( x = 2 \\), both equations yield \\( y = 15 \\). **This validates that \\( (2, 15) \\) is also an intersection point.**\n\n---\n\n**Checking the Order of Points:**\n\n- Given the \\( x \\)-coordinates, \\(-4\\) precedes \\(2\\).\n- Therefore, the points in increasing \\( x \\)-order are \\((-4, 27)\\) and \\( (2, 15) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Answer**\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>\n\n**Points of Intersection:**\n\n\\((-4, 27); (2, 15)\\)\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n---\n\n**Recap of the Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Recognized the need to find intersection points by equating the two parabolic equations.\n2. **Setting Equations Equal:** Led to forming a quadratic equation in terms of \\( x \\).\n3. **Simplifying the Equation:** Successfully reduced it to \\( 2x^2 + 4x - 16 = 0 \\).\n4. **Solving the Quadratic:** Factoring was effective, yielding \\( x = -4 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n5. **Verifying Solutions:** Substituting back confirmed that the corresponding \\( y \\)-coordinates matched for both equations.\n6. **Listing the Points:** Ordered the intersection points by increasing \\( x \\)-coordinates.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Initial Strategy Worked:** Setting the equations equal was the correct approach to find the intersection points.\n- **Factoring Was Effective:** The quadratic equation factored neatly, simplifying the solution process.\n- **Verification Essential:** Plugging the \\( x \\)-values back into the original equations ensured the accuracy of the solutions, preventing potential errors.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy systematically setting the equations equal, simplifying, solving, and verifying, we confidently arrived at the correct points of intersection.

Always remember to double-check solutions by substituting back into the original equations to confirm their validity.\n\n---\n\n### **End of Solution**\n\n---",
  "ground_truth": "Setting the right-hand sides of the given equations equal gives $3x^2+4x-5=x^2+11$. Combining like terms gives $2x^2+4x=16$. Dividing by $2$ gives $x^2+2x=8$, and rearranging gives $x^2 +2x - 8=0$.  Factoring gives $(x+4)(x-2)=0$, so our solutions are $x=-4$ and $x=2$.  Substituting these into either of the original equations to find the corresponding values of $y$, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-4, 27);(2, 15)}$."
