  "solution": "To solve the problem \\((0.\\overline{09})(0.\\overline{7})\\), we start by converting the repeating decimals into fractions.\n\n1. **Convert \\(0.\\overline{09}\\) to a fraction:**\n   Let \\(x = 0.\\overline{09}\\).\n   - By multiplying by 100, we have:\n     \\[\n     100x = 9.\\overline{09}\n     \\]\n   - Subtracting the original equation from this gives:\n     \\[\n     100x - x = 9.\\overline{09} - 0.\\overline{09} \\implies 99x = 9\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, solving for \\(x\\) results in:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{9}{99} = \\frac{1}{11}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) to a fraction:**\n   Let \\(y = 0.\\overline{7}\\).\n   - By multiplying by 10, we have:\n     \\[\n     10y = 7.\\overline{7}\n     \\]\n   - Subtracting the original gives:\n     \\[\n     10y - y = 7.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{7} \\implies 9y = 7\n     \\]\n   - Thus, solving for \\(y\\) results in:\n     \\[\n     y = \\frac{7}{9}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the two fractions:**\n   We now multiply the fractions obtained:\n   \\[\n   (0.\\overline{09})(0.\\overline{7}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{11}\\right) \\left(\\frac{7}{9}\\right)\n   \\]\n   - This leads to:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1 \\cdot 7}{11 \\cdot 9} = \\frac{7}{99}\n     \\]\n\n4. **State the final answer:**\n   Therefore, the product \\((0.\\overline{09})(0.\\overline{7})\\) expressed as a common fraction is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7}{99}\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER> \\(\\frac{7}{99}\\) solution </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We begin by expressing $0.\\overline{09}$ and $0.\\overline{7}$ as common fractions.\n\nTo express the number $0.\\overline{09}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $100x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&100x &=& 9&.090909\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.090909\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&99x &=& 9 &\n\\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{09} = \\frac{9}{99} = \\frac{1}{11}$.\n\nWe can do a similar trick to express $0.\\overline{7}$ as a fraction. Call this number $y$ and subtract it from $10y$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&10y &=& 7&.77777\\ldots \\\\\n- &y &=& 0&.77777\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&9y &=& 7 &\n\\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{7} = \\frac{7}{9}$.\n\nTherefore, $(0.\\overline{09})(0.\\overline{7})=\\frac{1}{11} \\cdot \\frac{7}{9} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{99}}$."
