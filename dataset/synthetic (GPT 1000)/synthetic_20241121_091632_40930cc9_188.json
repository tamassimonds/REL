  "problem": "Given that $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$, what is the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$?",
  "solution": "To find the range of the function \\( f(x) = x^k \\) for \\( k < 0 \\) on the interval \\( [1, \\infty) \\), we can analyze the function's behavior step by step:\n\n1. **Function Behavior**: Since \\( k \\) is negative, we can express the function as \\( f(x) = x^k = \\frac{1}{x^{-k}} \\) where \\( -k > 0 \\). This implies that \\( f(x) \\) is a decreasing function, meaning that as \\( x \\) increases, the value of \\( f(x) \\) decreases.\n\n2. **Endpoint Evaluation**:\n   - At the left endpoint \\( x = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     f(1) = 1^k = 1\n     \\]\n   - As \\( x \\) approaches infinity:\n     \\[\n     \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} x^k = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{x^{-k}} = 0 \\quad (\\text{since } k < 0)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Monotonicity**: The function \\( f(x) \\) is confirmed to be decreasing on the interval \\( [1, \\infty) \\). Therefore, its maximum value occurs at the left endpoint and approaches a minimum value as \\( x \\) increases towards infinity.\n\n4. **Range Calculation**:\n   - The function starts at \\( f(1) = 1 \\) and decreases toward \\( f(x) \\to 0 \\) as \\( x \\) increases. Consequently, \\( f(x) \\) takes on every value from \\( 0 \\) (never reaching \\( 0 \\)) up to \\( 1 \\) (including \\( 1 \\)).\n\n5. **Final Range**: Thus, the range of the function \\( f(x) \\) on the interval \\( [1, \\infty) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   (0, 1]\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n<ANSWER>(0, 1] solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We are looking at the range of $f(x)$ when $x$ is in the interval $[1,\\infty)$. Because $k < 0$, $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches 0, but never reaches it.  Hence, on the interval $[1,\\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values between 0 (exclusive) and 1 inclusive, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{(0,1]}$."
