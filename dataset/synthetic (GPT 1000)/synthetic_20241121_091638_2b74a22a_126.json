  "solution": "To solve the equation \n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x+B)(Ax+28)}{(x+C)(x+7)} = 2,\n\\]\n\nwe need to determine the conditions under which this equation has infinitely many solutions for \\( x \\), as well as identify certain values of \\( x \\) where the equation is not defined.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Clear the Fraction\n\nWe start by cross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n(x + B)(Ax + 28) = 2(x + C)(x + 7).\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Expand Both Sides\n\nNext, we expand both sides of the equation:\n\n1. **Left-Hand Side**:\n   \\[\n   (x + B)(Ax + 28) = Ax^2 + 28x + ABx + 28B = Ax^2 + (AB + 28)x + 28B.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Right-Hand Side**:\n   \\[\n   2(x + C)(x + 7) = 2(x^2 + (C + 7)x + 7C) = 2x^2 + 2(C + 7)x + 14C.\n   \\]\n\n#### Step 3: Set Coefficients Equal\n\nFor the equation to have infinitely many solutions, the coefficients of corresponding terms must be equal:\n\n1. For \\( x^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   A = 2.\n   \\]\n\n2. For \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   AB + 28 = 2(C + 7).\n   \\]\n\n3. For the constant term:\n   \\[\n   28B = 14C.\n   \\]\n\n#### Step 4: Solve the System of Equations\n\nSubstituting \\( A = 2 \\) into the other equations:\n\n1. From the x-coefficient equation:\n   \\[\n   2B + 28 = 2C + 14 \\implies 2B - 2C = -14 \\implies B - C = -7 \\implies B = C - 7.\n   \\]\n\n2. From the constant term equation:\n   \\[\n   28B = 14C \\implies 2B = C \\implies B = \\frac{C}{2}.\n   \\]\n\nNow we have:\n\n1. \\( B = C - 7 \\)\n2. \\( B = \\frac{C}{2} \\)\n\nSetting these equal:\n\n\\[\nC - 7 = \\frac{C}{2}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 5: Solve for \\( C \\)\n\nMultiply through by 2:\n\n\\[\n2C - 14 = C \\implies 2C - C = 14 \\implies C = 14.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 6: Find \\( B \\)\n\nSubstituting back to find \\( B \\):\n\n\\[\nB = C - 7 = 14 - 7 = 7.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 7: Summarize \\( A, B, C \\)\n\nThus, we have determined:\n\n\\[\nA = 2, \\quad B = 7, \\quad C = 14.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 8: Identify Values of \\( x \\) Not Solutions\n\nNext, we need to find the values of \\( x \\) that make the denominator zero:\n\n\\[\n(x + C)(x + 7) = 0 \\implies (x + 14)(x + 7) = 0.\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor to zero gives:\n\n\\[\nx + 14 = 0 \\implies x = -14,\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 7 = 0 \\implies x = -7.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 9: Calculate the Sum of Non-Solution Values\n\nFinally, we sum these non-solution values:\n\n\\[\n-14 + (-7) = -21.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe sum of the values of \\( x \\) that are not solutions to the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-21}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "If the given equation is true, then multiplying by $(x+C)(x+7)$ gives the equation \\[(x+B)(Ax+28) = 2(x+C)(x+7),\\]which must also be true. (Note however, that the converse does not hold: that is, by multiplying by $(x+C)(x+7),$ we may have introduced extraneous roots.) Therefore, the above equation must also have infinitely many roots for $x.$ That is, the polynomials $(x+B)(Ax+28)$ and $2(x+C)(x+7)$ must agree for infinitely many values of $x.$ This means that they must be identical polynomials. (In general, if $p(x) = q(x)$ for infinitely many $x,$ then $p(x) - q(x) = 0$ has infinitely many roots, which is only possible if $p(x) - q(x)$ is identically the zero polynomial.)\n\nThis means that \\[(x+B)(Ax+28) = 2(x+C)(x+7)\\]for all $x.$ Expanding both sides, we get \\[Ax^2 + (AB+28)x + 28B = 2x^2 + (2C+14)x + 14C.\\]Corresponding coefficients of both sides must be equal, so we have \\[\\begin{aligned} A &= 2, \\\\ AB+28 &= 2C+14, \\\\ 28B &= 14C. \\end{aligned}\\]From the first and third equations, $A=2$ and $C=2B.$ Then substituting into the second equation gives \\[2B+28 = 4B+14,\\]so $B=7,$ and then $C=14.$ This means that our original equation was \\[\\frac{(x+7)(2x+28)}{(x+14)(x+7)} = 2.\\]This equation holds whenever the denominator is nonzero. The denominator is equal to zero when $x=-7$ and $x=-14,$ so the sum of the values of $x$ which are not roots of the original equation is $(-7)+(-14) = \\boxed{-21}.$"
