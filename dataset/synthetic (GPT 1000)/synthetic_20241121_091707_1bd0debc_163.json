  "solution": "To find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) that is a multiple of \\( 75 \\) and has exactly \\( 75 \\) positive divisors, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of \\( 75 \\)\nThe prime factorization of \\( 75 \\) is:\n\\[\n75 = 3^1 \\cdot 5^2\n\\]\nThis means that \\( n \\) must include at least \\( 3^1 \\) and \\( 5^2 \\) in its prime factorization.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the Divisor Function\nThe number of positive divisors \\( d(n) \\) of an integer \\( n \\) can be found using:\n\\[\nn = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}\n\\]\nwhere the number of divisors is given by:\n\\[\nd(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)\n\\]\nWe need \\( d(n) = 75 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Factor \\( 75 \\)\nWe can factor \\( 75 \\) in several ways, each yielding potential forms for \\( (e_1 + 1), (e_2 + 1), \\ldots \\):\n- \\( 75 = 75 \\)\n- \\( 75 = 25 \\cdot 3 \\)\n- \\( 75 = 15 \\cdot 5 \\)\n- \\( 75 = 5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\)\n\n### Step 4: Possible Combinations\nFrom these factors, we derive possible structures for \\( n \\):\n1. **Case 1:** \\( n = p_1^{74} \\)\n2. **Case 2:** \\( n = p_1^{24} p_2^{2} \\)\n3. **Case 3:** \\( n = p_1^{14} p_2^{4} \\)\n4. **Case 4:** \\( n = p_1^{4} p_2^{4} p_3^{2} \\)\n\n### Step 5: Ensuring \\( n \\) is a Multiple of \\( 75 \\)\nTo satisfy the requirement that \\( n \\) includes \\( 3^1 \\) and \\( 5^2 \\), we can utilize Case 4, which allows for three distinct primes.

  "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of $75 = 3^15^2 = (2+1)(4+1)(4+1)$. For $n$ to have exactly $75$ integral divisors, we need to have $n = p_1^{e_1-1}p_2^{e_2-1}\\cdots$ such that $e_1e_2 \\cdots = 75$. Since $75|n$, two of the prime factors must be $3$ and $5$. To minimize $n$, we can introduce a third prime factor, $2$. Also to minimize $n$, we want $5$, the greatest of all the factors, to be raised to the least power. Therefore, $n = 2^43^45^2$ and $\\frac{n}{75} = \\frac{2^43^45^2}{3 \\cdot 5^2} = 16 \\cdot 27 = \\boxed{432}$."
