  "problem": "Let the first term of a geometric sequence be $\\frac{3}{4}$, and let the second term be $15$. What is the smallest $n$ for which the $n$th term of the sequence is divisible by one million?",
  "solution": "To determine the smallest \\( n \\) for which the \\( n \\)-th term of the geometric sequence is divisible by one million, we start by defining the sequence:\n\n1. **Define the Terms**:  \n   The first term \\( a \\) is given as \\( a = \\frac{3}{4} \\), and the second term \\( ar \\) is \\( ar = 15 \\). Here, \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n\n2. **Find the Common Ratio \\( r \\)**:  \n   From the equation \\( ar = 15 \\), we calculate the common ratio:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{ar}{a} = \\frac{15}{\\frac{3}{4}} = 15 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = 20.\n   \\]\n\n3. **General Formula for the \\( n \\)-th Term**:  \n   The \\( n \\)-th term \\( a_n \\) of the sequence is given by:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a \\cdot r^{n-1} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot (20)^{n-1}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine When \\( a_n \\) is Divisible by One Million**:\n   One million can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   1,000,000 = 10^6 = 2^6 \\cdot 5^6.\n   \\]\n   We need \\( a_n \\) to be divisible by \\( 10^6 \\).\n\n5. **Factor \\( 20 \\)**:  \n   The number 20 can be factored into primes:\n   \\[\n   20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^1.\n   \\]\n   Hence, we can rewrite \\( (20)^{n-1} \\):\n   \\[\n   (20)^{n-1} = (2^2 \\cdot 5^1)^{n-1} = 2^{2(n-1)} \\cdot 5^{n-1}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Combine with the First Term**:  \n   The \\( n \\)-th term becomes:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 2^{2(n-1)} \\cdot 5^{n-1}.\n   \\]\n   We rewrite \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} = 3 \\cdot 2^{-2},\n   \\]\n   leading to:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 3 \\cdot 2^{-2} \\cdot 2^{2(n-1)} \\cdot 5^{n-1} = 3 \\cdot 2^{2n - 4} \\cdot 5^{n-1}.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Determine Conditions for Divisibility**:  \n   For \\( a_n \\) to be divisible by \\( 2^6 \\) and \\( 5^6 \\):\n   \n   - **For 2**:\n     \\[\n     2n - 4 \\geq 6 \\implies 2n \\geq 10 \\implies n \\geq 5.\n     \\]\n   \n   - **For 5**:\n     \\[\n     n - 1 \\geq 6 \\implies n \\geq 7.\n     \\]\n\n   Combining both conditions, the stricter requirement is \\( n \\geq 7 \\).\n\n8. **Conclusion**:  \n   Therefore, the smallest integer \\( n \\) for which the \\( n \\)-th term of the sequence is divisible by one million is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{7}.\n   \\]",
  "ground_truth": "The common ratio is $$\\frac{15}{\\frac{3}{4}} = 20$$Therefore, the $n$th term is $(20^{n-1}) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)$.\n\n\nIf one million (aka $10^6$) divides the $n$th term, then it must be divisible by $5^6$. This can only happen if $n-1$ is at least $6$, or $n \\ge 7$.\n\n\nThe $7$th term is $$\\left(20^6\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\left(4\\right)^6\\left(5\\right)^6\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = (2)^{10}(5)^6(3),$$which is divisible by $(2)^6(5)^6=10^6$, so the answer is indeed $\\boxed{7}$."
