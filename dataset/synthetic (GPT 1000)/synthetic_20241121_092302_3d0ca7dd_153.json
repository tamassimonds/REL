  "problem": "We have a standard deck of 52 cards, with 4 cards in each of 13 ranks.  We call a 5-card poker hand a full house if the hand has 3 cards of one rank and 2 cards of another rank (such as 33355 or AAAKK).  What is the probability that five cards chosen at random form a full house?",
  "solution": "To determine the probability of drawing a full house from a standard 52-card deck, we can break the process down into clear steps:\n\n### Step 1: Define a Full House\nA full house consists of:\n- 3 cards of one rank (Rank A),\n- 2 cards of a different rank (Rank B).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Full House Combinations\n\n#### 2.1 Choose Ranks\n1. **Choose Rank A** (for the three cards): There are 13 possible ranks, so we can select Rank A in 13 ways.\n2. **Choose Rank B** (for the two cards): After selecting Rank A, 12 ranks remain for Rank B, giving us 12 options.\n\n#### 2.2 Choose Cards\n1. **Select 3 Cards from Rank A**: Each rank has 4 cards. The number of ways to choose 3 out of these 4 cards is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{3} = 4\n   \\]\n2. **Select 2 Cards from Rank B**: Similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 out of the 4 cards of Rank B is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Total Number of Full House Hands\nWe combine our choices for ranks and cards to find the total number of full house hands:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Full House Hands} = (13 \\text{ choices for Rank A}) \\times (12 \\text{ choices for Rank B}) \\times \\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2}\n\\]\nCalculating this, we have:\n\\[\n= 13 \\times 12 \\times 4 \\times 6 = 3744.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Total Number of Possible 5-Card Hands\nNext, we calculate the total possible 5-card combinations from a 52-card deck:\n\\[\n\\binom{52}{5} = 2598960.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Probability\nThe probability of drawing a full house is the ratio of the number of full house hands to the total number of hands:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Full House}) = \\frac{3744}{2598960}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplifying the Probability\nAfter simplification, this probability can be expressed approximately as:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Full House}) \\approx 0.0014405762,\n\\]\nor, as a fraction:\n\\[\n\\approx \\frac{6}{4165}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability of drawing a full house from a random selection of five cards is approximately 0.0014405762.",
  "ground_truth": "The total number of outcomes is just the number of ways to choose 5 cards from a set of 52, which is $\\binom{52}{5} = 2,\\!598,\\!960$.  Notice that in this count, we don't care about the order in which the cards are chosen.\n\nTo count the number of successful outcomes, we turn to constructive counting, thinking about how we'd construct a full house.\n\nTo form a full house, we have to choose:\n\nA rank for the 3 cards.  This can be done in 13 ways.\n\n3 of the 4 cards of that rank.  This can be done in $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways.\n\nA rank for the other 2 cards.  This can be done in 12 ways (since we can't choose the rank that we chose in (a)).\n\n2 of the 4 cards of that rank.  This can be done in $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\n\nAgain, note that in each of the steps in our constructive count, we don't care about the order in which the cards are chosen.\n\nSo there are $13 \\times 4 \\times 12 \\times 6 = 3,\\!744$ full houses.  Thus, the probability is $$ \\frac{3,\\!744}{2,\\!598,\\!960} = \\boxed{\\frac{6}{4165}}. $$"
