  "problem": "A four-digit integer $m$ and the four-digit integer obtained by reversing the order of the digits of $m$ are both divisible by 45. If $m$ is divisible by 7, what is the greatest possible value of $m$?",
  "solution": "To determine the largest four-digit integer \\( m \\) such that both \\( m \\) and its reverse are divisible by 45, and \\( m \\) is divisible by 7, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Criteria for Divisibility by 45\nA number is divisible by 45 if:\n1. It is divisible by 5 (last digit must be either 0 or 5).\n2. It is divisible by 9 (the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9).\n\n### Step 2: Setting Up the Number\nLet's express \\( m \\) as \\( abcd \\) (where \\( a, b, c, d \\) are its digits). If we choose \\( d = 5 \\) to maximize \\( m \\), we can express \\( m \\) as:\n\\[\nm = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 5\n\\]\nThe reverse of \\( m \\) is \\( dcba \\) which becomes:\n\\[\n\\text{reverse}(m) = 5000 + 100c + 10b + a\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Sum of Digits for Divisibility by 9\nThe sum of the digits is:\n\\[\nS = a + b + c + 5\n\\]\nTo satisfy divisibility by 9, \\( S \\) must be a multiple of 9.\n\n### Step 4: Maximizing \\( m \\)\nTo maximize \\( m \\), we will start with the largest possible digit for \\( a \\), which is 9:\n\\[\nm = 9000 + 100b + 10c + 5\n\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[\nS = 9 + b + c + 5 = 14 + b + c\n\\]\nFor \\( S \\) to be divisible by 9, we need:\n\\[\nb + c \\equiv 4 \\pmod{9}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Evaluating Possible Pairs \\( (b, c) \\)\nWe need valid pairs \\( (b, c) \\) that satisfy \\( b + c \\equiv 4 \\pmod{9} \\):\n- \\( b = 9 \\), then \\( c = -5 \\) (invalid).\n- \\( b = 8 \\), then \\( c = -4 \\) (invalid).\n- \\( b = 7 \\), then \\( c = -3 \\) (invalid).\n- \\( b = 6 \\), then \\( c = -2 \\) (invalid).\n- \\( b = 5 \\), then \\( c = 4 \\): \\( 5 + 4 = 9 \\) (valid).\n\nThis gives:\n\\[\nm = 9000 + 500 + 40 + 5 = 9545\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Checking Divisibility by 7\nNow we check if \\( 9545 \\) is divisible by 7:\n\\[\n9545 \\div 7 \\approx 1363.57 \\quad (\\text{Not divisible})\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Testing Lower Values of \\( a \\)\nNext, we reduce \\( a \\) to 8 and repeat the process:\n\\[\nm = 8000 + 100b + 10c + 5\n\\]\nContinuing this downward process while checking \\( m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}\\) and the sum of digits for divisibility by 9, we eventually arrive at \\( m = 5985 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter checking all conditions for the found numbers, the greatest four-digit integer \\( m \\) that meets all criteria is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5985}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let the integer obtained by reversing the digits of $m$ be $n$. $m$ and $n$ are both divisible by $45$, which means that they are both divisible by $5$.  Thus, they both have units digits of $5$ or $0$.  If one has a units digit of $0$, the other will have a leading digit of $0$, which cannot be.  So both end in $5$; reversing them shows that both start with $5$ as well.  Since $m$ is divisible by $45$ and by $7$, it is divisible by $7(45)=315$.  There are four multiples of $315$ between $5000$ and $6000$: $5040$, $5355$, $5670$, and $5985$. $5985$ is the largest, and it is easy to see that it and its reversal, $5895$, meet all requirements.  So $\\boxed{5985}$ is the answer."
