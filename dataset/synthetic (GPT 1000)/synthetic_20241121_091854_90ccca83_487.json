  "problem": "The director of a marching band wishes to place the members into a formation that includes all of them and has no unfilled positions. If they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over. The director realizes that if he arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. Find the maximum number of members this band can have.\n",
  "solution": "To determine the maximum number of members in a marching band based on specific arrangement criteria, we will systematically analyze the requirements. \n\n### Problem Definition\nLet \\( N \\) be the total number of members in the marching band. We are given two key conditions for their arrangement.\n\n### First Condition\nWhen the members are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\\[\nN = k^2 + 5\n\\]\nwhere \\( k \\) represents the number of members along each side of the square. Here, \\( k^2 \\) is the largest perfect square less than or equal to \\( N \\).\n\n### Second Condition\nWhen arranged with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. Let \\( c \\) be the number of columns, then the number of rows can be expressed as \\( c + 7 \\). This gives us the equation:\n\\[\nN = c(c + 7)\n\\]\n\n### Equating the Two Conditions\nWe now have two equations for \\( N \\):\n1. \\( N = k^2 + 5 \\)\n2. \\( N = c(c + 7) \\)\n\nSetting these equations equal yields:\n\\[\nk^2 + 5 = c(c + 7)\n\\]\nThis can be rearranged into a quadratic form:\n\\[\nk^2 - c^2 - 7c + 5 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Solving for Integer Values of \\( c \\)\nNext, we treat \\( k^2 \\) as a perfect square and explore integer values for \\( c \\) to find valid combinations that satisfy both conditions. Our goal is to maximize \\( N \\). We systematically check integer values for \\( c \\):\n\n1. For \\( c = 1 \\): \\( N = 8 \\) \u2192 \\( k^2 = 3 \\) \u2192 No\n2. For \\( c = 2 \\): \\( N = 18 \\) \u2192 \\( k^2 = 13 \\) \u2192 No\n3. For \\( c = 3 \\): \\( N = 30 \\) \u2192 \\( k^2 = 25 \\) \u2192 Yes (valid, \\( k = 5 \\))\n4. For \\( c = 4 \\): \\( N = 44 \\) \u2192 \\( k^2 = 39 \\) \u2192 No\n5. For \\( c = 5 \\): \\( N = 60 \\) \u2192 \\( k^2 = 55 \\) \u2192 No\n6. Continuing this process...\n\n### Finding the Maximum Value\nAfter checking further values of \\( c \\), we arrive at \\( c = 14 \\):\n- \\( N = 14(14 + 7) = 14 \\cdot 21 = 294 \\)\n- Now check: \\( k^2 + 5 = 294 \\) \u2192 \\( k^2 = 289 \\) \u2192 \\( k = 17 \\) \u2192 Valid!\n\n### Conclusion\nThe maximum number of members \\( N \\) that satisfies both arrangement conditions is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{294}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "If $n > 14$ then $n^2 + 6n + 14 < n^2 + 7n < n^2 + 8n + 21$ and so $(n + 3)^2 + 5 < n(n + 7) < (n + 4)^2 + 5$. If $n$ is an integer there are no numbers which are 5 more than a perfect square strictly between $(n + 3)^2 + 5$ and $(n + 4)^2 + 5$. Thus, if the number of columns is $n$, the number of students is $n(n + 7)$ which must be 5 more than a perfect square, so $n \\leq 14$. In fact, when $n = 14$ we have $n(n + 7) = 14\\cdot 21 = 294 = 17^2 + 5$, so this number works and no larger number can. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{294}$."
