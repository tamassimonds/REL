    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through it as a human would. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I recognize that it's about finding the values of \\( g \\) and \\( h \\) in two polynomial expressions whose product equals a given polynomial. This reminds me of polynomial multiplication, specifically using the distributive property or the FOIL method for binomials.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Multiply the two polynomials directly using the distributive property and then compare coefficients with the given polynomial.\n- **Strategy 2:** Use substitution to set up equations based on matching coefficients.\n- **Strategy 3:** Consider using synthetic division or polynomial long division if the direct multiplication seems too complex.\n- **Strategy 4:** Check if there's a pattern or identity that simplifies the multiplication.\n\nI'm leaning towards **Strategy 1**\u2014multiplying the polynomials directly\u2014because it seems straightforward. If that doesn't work out, I can try **Strategy 2**, setting up equations based on coefficients.\n\n**Wait...** Before finalizing, I should recall that multiplying polynomials directly can get messy, especially with multiple terms. Maybe **Strategy 2** would be cleaner by setting up equations for each coefficient separately. **Hmm, perhaps starting with multiplying directly and then switching to setting up equations if needed would be best.**\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting Direct Multiplication**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s start by multiplying the two polynomials step by step. This will help me see how each term contributes to the final product and might make it easier to identify \\( g \\) and \\( h \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nMultiply \\( (7d^2 - 3d + g) \\) and \\( (3d^2 + hd - 8) \\):\n\n1. **First Term Multiplication:**\n   - \\( 7d^2 \\times 3d^2 = 21d^4 \\)\n   \n2. **Mix Terms:**\n   - \\( 7d^2 \\times hd = 7h d^3 \\)\n   - \\( 7d^2 \\times (-8) = -56d^2 \\)\n   - \\( -3d \\times 3d^2 = -9d^3 \\)\n   - \\( -3d \\times hd = -3h d^2 \\)\n   - \\( -3d \\times (-8) = 24d \\)\n   - \\( g \\times 3d^2 = 3g d^2 \\)\n   - \\( g \\times hd = ghd \\)\n   - \\( g \\times (-8) = -8g \\)\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms:**\n   - \\( 21d^4 \\)\n   - \\( 7h d^3 - 9d^3 = (7h - 9) d^3 \\)\n   - \\( -56d^2 - 3h d^2 + 3g d^2 = (-56 - 3h + 3g) d^2 \\)\n   - \\( 24d + ghd = (24 + gh) d \\)\n   - \\( -8g \\)\n\n**Combined Polynomial:**\n\\[\n21d^4 + (7h - 9)d^3 + (-56 - 3h + 3g)d^2 + (24 + gh)d - 8g\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks messy, but at least I've laid out all the terms. **Wait, let me check if this aligns with the given polynomial \\( 21d^4 - 44d^3 - 35d^2 + 14d - 16 \\).**\n\n### **Step 2: Comparing Coefficients**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find \\( g \\) and \\( h \\), I need to compare the coefficients of corresponding terms in both polynomials. This should give me a system of equations to solve.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\( d^4 \\):**\n   \\[\n   21 = 21 \\quad \\text{(matches)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Coefficient of \\( d^3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   7h - 9 = -44\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Coefficient of \\( d^2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   -56 - 3h + 3g = -35\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Coefficient of \\( d \\):**\n   \\[\n   24 + gh = 14\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Constant Term:**\n   \\[\n   -8g = -16\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe coefficients give us a system of equations. **Hmm, this seems like a good approach.** Let's solve these equations step by step.\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nStart with the simplest equation and solve for one variable. Then substitute back into the other equations to find the remaining variables.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **From the Constant Term:**\n   \\[\n   -8g = -16 \\implies g = \\frac{-16}{-8} = 2\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute \\( g = 2 \\) into the \\( d^2 \\) Coefficient Equation:**\n   \\[\n   -56 - 3h + 3(2) = -35\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -56 - 3h + 6 = -35\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -50 - 3h = -35\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -3h = -35 + 50\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -3h = 15 \\implies h = \\frac{15}{-3} = -5\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Check with the \\( d^3 \\) Coefficient Equation:**\n   \\[\n   7(-5) - 9 = -35 - 9 = -44 \\quad \\text{(matches)}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Check with the \\( d \\) Coefficient Equation:**\n   \\[\n   24 + (-5)(2) = 24 - 10 = 14 \\quad \\text{(matches)}\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n\nAll coefficients match after solving for \\( g \\) and \\( h \\). **Oh! This confirms that the values are correct.**\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIt's essential to ensure that the multiplication and coefficient comparison were done correctly. Let's briefly verify by plugging \\( g = 2 \\) and \\( h = -5 \\) back into the original equations.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Constant Term:**\n   \\[\n   -8(2) = -16 \\quad \\text{(matches)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **\\( d^2 \\) Coefficient:**\n   \\[\n   -56 - 3(-5) + 3(2) = -56 + 15 + 6 = -35 \\quad \\text{(matches)}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **\\( d^3 \\) Coefficient:**\n   \\[\n   7(-5) - 9 = -35 - 9 = -44 \\quad \\text{(matches)}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **\\( d \\) Coefficient:**\n   \\[\n   24 + (-5)(2) = 24 - 10 = 14 \\quad \\text{(matches)}\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out! **Phew, that's reassuring.** The values \\( g = 2 \\) and \\( h = -5 \\) are indeed correct.\n\n### **Final Step: Finding \\( g + h \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that we've determined \\( g \\) and \\( h \\), simply add them together to find \\( g + h \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\ng + h = 2 + (-5) = 2 - 5 = -3\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\ng + h = -3\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy starting with direct multiplication and then comparing coefficients, we were able to set up and solve a system of equations to find \\( g \\) and \\( h \\). Checking each step ensured the solution's accuracy. **Overall, this approach was effective, though beginning with direct multiplication made the process slightly more involved. Switching to solving for coefficients streamlined finding \\( g \\) and \\( h \\).**\n\nAhh, reflecting on this, maybe **Strategy 2** (setting up equations from the start) would have made it cleaner by avoiding the initial multiplication step. But since both methods ultimately led to the correct answer, it's a matter of preference and ensuring each step is carefully checked.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** Always verify each step and be flexible in adjusting strategies for clarity and efficiency.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed, step-by-step reflection helps understand how to approach such problems, including brainstorming strategies, checking work, and adjusting methods as needed.",
