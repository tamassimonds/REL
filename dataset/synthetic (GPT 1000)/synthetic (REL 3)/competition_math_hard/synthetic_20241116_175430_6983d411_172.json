I'll walk through my thought process step by step, exploring different strategies, checking my work often, and adjusting my approach as needed. It\u2019s important to think out loud, reflect, and make sure each step is leading me in the right direction. Here goes:\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see the question, **\u201cFor what values of \\( b \\) is \\(-2\\) not in the range of the function \\( f(x) = x^2 + bx + 2 \\)?\u201d**, several things come to mind:\n\n- **Nature of the Function:** \\( f(x) \\) is a quadratic function. Quadratic functions usually have a parabolic graph.\n  \n- **Range of Quadratics:** I recall that the range of a quadratic depends on its vertex (the highest or lowest point) and the direction it opens (upward or downward).\n\n- **Threshold Value:** The specific value \\(-2\\) is given. I need to determine under what conditions this value is *not* output by the function \\( f(x) \\).\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Vertex Analysis:** Find the vertex of the parabola to see the minimum or maximum value.\n  2. **Discriminant Approach:** Use the quadratic formula to see if the equation \\( f(x) = -2 \\) has real solutions.\n  3. **Completing the Square:** Rewriting the quadratic to easily identify its range.\n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure which method will be the most straightforward, so I\u2019ll start by considering the Vertex Analysis because understanding the vertex gives direct insight into the range. If that doesn't pan out, I might switch to the Discriminant Approach or Completing the Square.\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Vertex Analysis**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me see if calculating the vertex of the parabola \\( f(x) \\) can help me determine the range. I remember that for quadratics \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\), the vertex \\( x \\)-coordinate is given by \\( x_v = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nGiven:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = b \\) (the coefficient I need to find)\n- \\( c = 2 \\)\n\nSo, the \\( x \\)-coordinate of the vertex is:\n\\[\nx_v = -\\frac{b}{2 \\times 1} = -\\frac{b}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute\u2014just finding the \\( x \\)-coordinate isn't enough. I also need to know the corresponding \\( y \\)-coordinate (the value of \\( f(x) \\) at the vertex) to understand the minimum or maximum value of the parabola.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nOkay, let\u2019s compute the \\( y \\)-coordinate of the vertex by plugging \\( x_v \\) back into the function \\( f(x) \\).\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Vertex's \\( y \\)-Coordinate**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the \\( x \\)-coordinate of the vertex, I\u2019ll substitute it into \\( f(x) \\) to find the \\( y \\)-coordinate. This will tell me the minimum (if the parabola opens upward) or maximum (if it opens downward) value of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nf\\left(-\\frac{b}{2}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 + b\\left(-\\frac{b}{2}\\right) + 2\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify this step by step:\n\n1. **Square the \\( x \\)-term:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(-\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{b^2}{4}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate the linear term:**\n   \\[\n   b \\times \\left(-\\frac{b}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{b^2}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Adding the constant:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b^2}{4} - \\frac{b^2}{2} + 2\n   \\]\n\n   Combine the quadratic terms:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b^2}{4} - \\frac{2b^2}{4} = -\\frac{b^2}{4}\n   \\]\n   \n   So,\n   \\[\n   y_v = -\\frac{b^2}{4} + 2\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, I've got the \\( y \\)-coordinate of the vertex. The minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( -\\frac{b^2}{4} + 2 \\).\n\nBut wait\u2014this depends on \\( b \\). I need to determine when \\(-2\\) is *not* in the range. So, let\u2019s set up an inequality to see under what conditions \\(-2\\) is outside the range.\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up the Inequality**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFor \\(-2\\) to *not* be in the range of \\( f(x) \\), it must be greater than the maximum value (if the parabola opens downward) or less than the minimum value (if it opens upward).\n\nGiven that the parabola opens upward (since \\( a = 1 > 0 \\)), the minimum value is at the vertex. Therefore, \\(-2\\) will be in the range if:\n\\[\n-2 \\geq -\\frac{b^2}{4} + 2\n\\]\n\nWhat I need is the opposite condition for \\(-2\\) to be *not* in the range:\n\\[\n-2 < -\\frac{b^2}{4} + 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis inequality makes sense. If \\(-2\\) is less than the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\), then \\(-2\\) is outside the range.\n\n### **Step 4: Simplifying the Inequality**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s solve this inequality step by step to find the values of \\( b \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nStart with:\n\\[\n-2 < -\\frac{b^2}{4} + 2\n\\]\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\\[\n-4 < -\\frac{b^2}{4}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(-4\\). Remember, multiplying by a negative number reverses the inequality:\n\\[\n16 > b^2\n\\]\nor\n\\[\nb^2 < 16\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, so the inequality \\( b^2 < 16 \\) means that \\( b \\) must lie within the bounds of \\( -4 \\) and \\( 4 \\).\n\n### **Step 5: Expressing the Solution in Interval Notation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe values of \\( b \\) that satisfy \\( b^2 < 16 \\) are those within the interval \\( (-4, 4) \\). This means that for \\( b \\) in this range, \\(-2\\) is not in the range of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSo, the solution in interval notation is:\n\\[\n(-4, 4)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet\u2019s double-check. The inequality \\( b^2 < 16 \\) translates to \\( -4 < b < 4 \\). Outside of this interval, \\( b^2 \\) would be 16 or more, making the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) equal to or greater than \\(-2\\), thus including \\(-2\\) in the range.\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore concluding, it's essential to verify that our solution makes sense. Let's pick a few values of \\( b \\) within and outside the interval \\( (-4, 4) \\) and see if \\(-2\\) is indeed not in the range when \\( b \\) is within the interval.\n\n**Check with \\( b = 3 \\):**\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2\n\\]\n\n- Vertex:\n  \\[\n  x_v = -\\frac{3}{2} = -1.5\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y_v = -\\frac{3^2}{4} + 2 = -\\frac{9}{4} + 2 = -\\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{8}{4} = -\\frac{1}{4}\n  \\]\n  \n- Minimum value is \\(-\\frac{1}{4}\\), which is greater than \\(-2\\). Therefore, \\(-2\\) is not in the range.\n\n**Check with \\( b = 5 \\):**\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + 5x + 2\n\\]\n\n- Vertex:\n  \\[\n  x_v = -\\frac{5}{2} = -2.5\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y_v = -\\frac{5^2}{4} + 2 = -\\frac{25}{4} + 2 = -\\frac{25}{4} + \\frac{8}{4} = -\\frac{17}{4} = -4.25\n  \\]\n  \n- Minimum value is \\(-4.25\\), which is less than \\(-2\\). Therefore, \\(-2\\) is in the range.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis verification confirms that our solution is correct. When \\( b \\) is within \\( (-4, 4) \\), \\(-2\\) is not in the range. Outside this interval, the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) is lower than \\(-2\\), thus including \\(-2\\) in the range.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy analyzing the vertex of the quadratic function and setting up the appropriate inequality, I determined that \\( b \\) must be within the interval \\( (-4, 4) \\) for \\(-2\\) to be outside the range of \\( f(x) \\). Exploring different strategies helped ensure the approach was correct, and verifying with specific examples solidified the solution's validity.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\nb \\in (-4, 4)\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "We see that $-2$ is not in the range of $f(x) = x^2 + bx + 2$ if and only if the equation $x^2 + bx + 2 = -2$ has no real roots.  We can re-write this equation as $x^2 + bx + 4 = 0$.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 = b^2 - 16$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $b^2 - 16 < 0$, or $b^2 < 16$.  The set of values of $b$ that satisfy this inequality is $b \\in \\boxed{(-4,4)}$."
