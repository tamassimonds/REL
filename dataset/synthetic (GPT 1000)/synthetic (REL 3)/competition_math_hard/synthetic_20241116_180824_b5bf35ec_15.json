I'll start by brainstorming my initial thoughts, exploring different strategies, reflecting on whether they're correct, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let's see where it takes me.\n\n### **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\n**User\u2019s Query:**\nHow many 4-digit positive integers exist that satisfy the following conditions:\n1. **(A)** Each of the first two digits must be 1, 4, or 5.\n2. **(B)** The last two digits cannot be the same digit.\n3. **(C)** Each of the last two digits must be 5, 7, or 8.\n\n**First Reactions:**\n- Okay, this is about counting specific 4-digit integers with given digit constraints.\n- The first two digits have limited choices: 1, 4, or 5.\n- The last two digits must be from 5, 7, or 8, and they can't be the same.\n- I need to ensure all conditions are met simultaneously.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Counting Method:** Calculate the number of valid combinations for each digit position while adhering to all conditions.\n2. **Permutations and Combinations:** Use combinatorial techniques to account for the restrictions, especially for the last two digits.\n3. **Systematic Listing:** Although impractical for larger sets, maybe start by listing a few examples to identify patterns and verify calculations.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Counting seems straightforward since each digit position has distinct choices.\n- However, the \"last two digits cannot be the same\" adds a layer of complexity, especially paired with the specific digits allowed.\n- Maybe starting with a simpler example could help build intuition.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Counting Each Digit Position Separately**\n\n**Step 1: Determining the First Two Digits**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Each of the first two digits can be 1, 4, or 5.\n- That's three options for each position.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Total combinations for the first two digits = \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Wait, is that correct? Shouldn't I ensure that these combinations align with the conditions for the last two digits?\n- Let me pause and think. The first two digit choices are independent of the last two, so this part seems correct.\n\n**Step 2: Determining the Last Two Digits**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Each of the last two digits must be 5, 7, or 8.\n- There are three choices for each position.\n- But, they can't be the same.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Without the restriction: \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n- With the restriction that they can't be the same:\n  - For the first of the last two digits, 3 choices.\n  - For the second, only 2 choices (must be different from the first).\n\n- Total combinations for the last two digits = \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Hmm, does this align with the conditions? Yes, because it ensures the last two digits are from 5, 7, or 8 and not repeating.\n- I think this part is correct.\n\n### **Combining Both Parts**\n\n**Step 3: Total Number of Valid 4-Digit Integers**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- The total number of valid integers is the product of the combinations for the first two and the last two digits.\n- Each part is independent, so multiplying makes sense.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Total = \\(9 \\times 6 = 54\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- Let me quickly verify. \n  - 9 combinations for the first two digits.\n  - 6 combinations for the last two digits where they're distinct and within the allowed set.\n  - Multiplying them seems logical.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- That number seems reasonable. \n- However, I wonder if there's a possibility of overcounting or missing any cases.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Verifying with Permutations and Combinations**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Just to be sure, let's approach it using permutations to see if the number aligns.\n- Although this seems straightforward, maybe a different method will catch anything missed.\n\n**Step 1: Treating Each Digit as a Selection with Constraints**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Select digits for each position while considering the constraints.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- First two digits: Choose 2 out of {1, 4, 5} with repetition allowed.\n  - Each position independent: \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\n- Last two digits: Choose 2 out of {5, 7, 8} without repetition.\n  - Must be distinct: \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n\n**Combining:**\n- Total = \\(9 \\times 6 = 54\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- The number matches the previous method. \n- This adds confidence that the calculation is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Using a different strategy yielded the same result.\n- Multiple approaches aligning suggests the solution is likely correct.\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- It's essential to ensure that all conditions are met and that no cases are overlooked.\n- Given that both strategies provided the same number, it reinforces the validity.\n\n**Check:**\n- First two digits: Limited to 1, 4, 5 \u2014 Total 9 combinations.\n- Last two digits: From 5, 7, 8, not repeating \u2014 Total 6 combinations.\n- Combined: \\(9 \\times 6 = 54\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- There are **54** four-digit positive integers that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- By exploring different strategies and verifying calculations, I've ensured that the solution is accurate.\n- Thinking through each step and checking along the way helped catch any potential errors early.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n**54**\n\nThere are 54 four-digit positive integers that meet all the specified conditions.\n\n---\n\nI hope this approach, reflecting natural thinking and checking processes, aligns well with solving the problem step-by-step. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore!",
