    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies and exploring how to approach it, just like I would if I were tackling this problem on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The problem asks for a monic cubic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) with integer coefficients such that \\( P(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1) = 0 \\).\n- Monic means the leading coefficient is 1.\n- I'm looking for a polynomial where \\( \\sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \\) is a root.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Approach 1:** Maybe I can directly construct the polynomial by using the given root.\n- **Approach 2:** Use the fact that any algebraic expression can be turned into a polynomial equation by eliminating the radical.\n- **Approach 3:** Consider transforming the variable to simplify the expression and then find the corresponding polynomial.\n- **Approach 4:** Check if this is similar to problems where you find minimal polynomials over the integers.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Direct construction sounds straightforward but might get messy with the cubic root.\n- Eliminating the radical seems systematic.\n- Transforming the variable might simplify things, making it easier to find the polynomial.\n\nI think starting with **Approach 2** \u2014 using the fact that I can eliminate the radical to form a polynomial \u2014 might be the most systematic way.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Approach 2 \u2013 Eliminating the Radical**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Given the root \\( \\alpha = \\sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \\), I need to express this in a way that allows me to eliminate the cube root.\n- If I can manipulate the equation to remove the cube root, I can find a polynomial that has \\( \\alpha \\) as a root.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Isolate the Radical:**\n   \\[\n   \\alpha - 1 = \\sqrt[3]{2}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Cube Both Sides to Eliminate the Radical:**\n   \\[\n   (\\alpha - 1)^3 = (\\sqrt[3]{2})^3\n   \\]\n   \n   Expanding the left side:\n   \\[\n   (\\alpha - 1)^3 = \\alpha^3 - 3\\alpha^2 + 3\\alpha - 1\n   \\]\n   \n   Right side:\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt[3]{2})^3 = 2\n   \\]\n   \n   So,\n   \\[\n   \\alpha^3 - 3\\alpha^2 + 3\\alpha - 1 = 2\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Rearrange the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\alpha^3 - 3\\alpha^2 + 3\\alpha - 1 - 2 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   \\alpha^3 - 3\\alpha^2 + 3\\alpha - 3 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n   So, our candidate polynomial is:\n   \\[\n   P(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 3\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Does this polynomial have \\( \\sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \\) as a root?\n- **Calculation:** Substitute \\( x = \\sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \\) into \\( P(x) \\):\n  \\[\n  P(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1) = (\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1)^3 - 3(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1)^2 + 3(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1) - 3\n  \\]\n  But this seems messy to calculate directly. **Wait**, maybe there's a simpler way to check if this polynomial is correct.\n\n**Alternative Check:**\n\n- **Think:** I could verify by plugging in values or see if simplifying \\( P(\\alpha) = 0 \\) holds true.\n- **Problem:** Direct calculation is getting cumbersome. Maybe I missed something.\n\n**Realization:**\n\n- **Mistake:** The original equation might have a sign error. Let me backtrack briefly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Re-examining the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- It's essential to ensure correctness. If direct cubing seems off, perhaps there's a flaw in that step.\n- Maybe there's an alternative method that can confirm or correct this polynomial.\n\n**Alternative Approach \u2013 Transforming the Variable:**\n\n- Perhaps using a substitution to simplify the expression before forming the polynomial could work better.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Approach 5:** Let\u2019s define a new variable that simplifies \\( \\sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \\) to, say, \\( y = \\sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \\).\n- **Approach 6:** Recognize that manipulating \\( y \\) might yield a simpler polynomial.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Transforming the variable can sometimes lead to a more straightforward polynomial.\n- Let's try substituting back to see if it simplifies the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Applying Approach 5 \u2013 Variable Substitution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let\u2019s define \\( y = \\sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \\).\n- I can then express \\( \\sqrt[3]{2} \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n  \\[\n  \\sqrt[3]{2} = y - 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Goal:** Find a polynomial in \\( y \\) that eliminates the cube root.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Cube Both Sides:**\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt[3]{2})^3 = (y - 1)^3\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   2 = y^3 - 3y^2 + 3y - 1\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Rearrange the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   y^3 - 3y^2 + 3y - 1 - 2 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   y^3 - 3y^2 + 3y - 3 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the polynomial remains:\n   \\[\n   P(y) = y^3 - 3y^2 + 3y - 3\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** This time, ensuring the steps align correctly with the original problem.\n- **Observation:** The polynomial hasn't changed, but transforming the variable clarified the relationship.\n\n**Realization:**\n\n- The initial approach was correct in forming the polynomial, but the verification step needed more care to ensure no calculation errors.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Polynomial**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, let's confirm that \\( P(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1) = 0 \\) holds true.\n- This step is crucial to ensure the correctness of the polynomial.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Substitute \\( y = \\sqrt[3]{2} + 1 \\) into \\( P(y) \\):**\n   \\[\n   P(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1) = (\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1)^3 - 3(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1)^2 + 3(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1) - 3\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Simplify Each Term:**\n   - **First Term:**\n     \\[\n     (\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1)^3 = (\\sqrt[3]{2})^3 + 3(\\sqrt[3]{2})^2 \\cdot 1 + 3(\\sqrt[3]{2}) \\cdot 1^2 + 1^3\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = 2 + 3\\sqrt[3]{4} + 3(\\sqrt[3]{2}) + 1 = 3 + 3\\sqrt[3]{4} + 3\\sqrt[3]{2}\n     \\]\n     \n   - **Second Term:**\n     \\[\n     -3(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1)^2 = -3(\\sqrt[3]{2})^2 + 2\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = -3\\sqrt[3]{4} - 6\\sqrt[3]{2} - 3\n     \\]\n     \n   - **Third Term:**\n     \\[\n     3(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1) = 3\\sqrt[3]{2} + 3\n     \\]\n     \n   - **Fourth Term:**\n     \\[\n     -3\n     \\]\n     \n3. **Combine All Terms:**\n   \\[\n   P(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1) = (3 + 3\\sqrt[3]{4} + 3\\sqrt[3]{2}) + (-3\\sqrt[3]{4} - 6\\sqrt[3]{2} - 3) + (3\\sqrt[3]{2} + 3) - 3\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   = 3 + 3\\sqrt[3]{4} + 3\\sqrt[3]{2} - 3\\sqrt[3]{4} - 6\\sqrt[3]{2} - 3 + 3\\sqrt[3]{2} + 3 - 3\n   \\]\n   \n   Notice that positive and negative terms cancel out:\n   \\[\n   = 0\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Conclusion:** \n   \\[\n   P(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1) = 0\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** The polynomial indeed satisfies \\( P(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1) = 0 \\), confirming it's correct.\n- **Observation:** Initial hesitation about the correctness was due to a complicated verification step, but breaking it down ensured accuracy.\n\n**Realization:**\n\n- It's essential to methodically verify each step, especially when dealing with radicals and polynomial transformations.\n- Transforming the variable helped clarify the relationship and ensured the correctness of the polynomial.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Finalizing the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now that verification confirms the polynomial is correct, I can finalize the answer.\n- It's important to present the polynomial clearly, ensuring it's monic and has integer coefficients.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe monic cubic polynomial with integer coefficients such that \n\\[\nP(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1) = 0\n\\]\nis \n\\[\nP(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 3.\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Final Check:** The polynomial meets all the criteria set by the problem: monic, cubic, and with integer coefficients.\n- **Confidence:** Multiple approaches and thorough verification ensure the solution's correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Started with exploring different strategies to eliminate the radical and form the polynomial.\n- **Adapting Strategies:** Realized that directly cubing the expression was correct but needed careful verification.\n- **Reflection and Verification:** Methodically checked each step, ensuring the polynomial accurately represents the given root.\n- **Confidence in the Solution:** The combination of variable substitution and thorough verification led to a correct and verified solution.\n\nBy thinking through different strategies, reflecting on the correctness at each step, and verifying the final answer, I ensured a comprehensive and accurate solution to the problem.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed walkthrough mirrors human problem-solving, incorporating brainstorming, adapting strategies, checking and reflecting, and ultimately arriving at a confident solution.",
