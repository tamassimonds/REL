    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were working through it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, **\"Both roots of the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 63x + k = 0\\) are prime numbers,\"** I think:\n\n- **Quadratic Equations:** I remember that quadratic equations have a standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), and the roots are related to the coefficients through Vieta's formulas. \n- **Prime Numbers:** The roots being prime adds a unique constraint. Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Vieta\u2019s Formulas:** Use the relationship between the coefficients and the roots.\n  2. **List Possible Prime Pairs:** Since both roots are primes, maybe list pairs of prime numbers and see if they fit.\n  3. **Discriminant Approach:** Ensure that for \\(k\\) to be valid, the discriminant must be a perfect square.\n\nHonestly, the first thing that pops into my mind is using **Vieta\u2019s Formulas**, which relate the sum and product of the roots to the coefficients. But I also think about listing possible prime pairs as a backup plan.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Vieta's Formulas**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Vieta's formulas tell us that for a quadratic \\(x^2 - bx + c = 0\\):\n  - The sum of the roots (\\(r_1 + r_2\\)) is equal to \\(b\\).\n  - The product of the roots (\\(r_1 \\times r_2\\)) is equal to \\(c\\).\n\n- In our equation \\(x^2 - 63x + k = 0\\):\n  - Sum of roots, \\(r_1 + r_2 = 63\\)\n  - Product of roots, \\(r_1 \\times r_2 = k\\)\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- Both \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) are prime numbers that add up to 63.\n- I recall that the only even prime number is 2. Therefore, if one root is 2, the other must be odd for their sum to be even (since 63 is odd, the sum of two odd primes would be even).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait, there\u2019s a flaw here. If both roots are prime, and their sum is 63 (an odd number), at least one of the primes must be even. The only even prime is 2. \n- That means one of the roots has to be 2, and the other has to be an odd prime.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- This makes sense. So, one root is 2, and the other is an odd prime such that their sum is 63.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Second Root**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since one root is 2, the other root \\(r_2\\) must be such that:\n  \\[\n  2 + r_2 = 63 \\implies r_2 = 61\n  \\]\n- Now, I need to verify if 61 is a prime number.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Is 61 Prime?**\n  - 61 isn't divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 (prime numbers up to \\(\\sqrt{61} \\approx 7.81\\)).\n  - Calculation:\n    - \\(61 \u00f7 2 = 30.5\\) \u2192 Not divisible\n    - \\(61 \u00f7 3 = 20.33\\) \u2192 Not divisible\n    - \\(61 \u00f7 5 = 12.2\\) \u2192 Not divisible\n    - \\(61 \u00f7 7 = 8.71\\) \u2192 Not divisible\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - Yes, 61 is a prime number. So, our roots are 2 and 61.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- There\u2019s only one possible pair of prime roots: (2, 61).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Value of \\(k\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The product of the roots \\(r_1 \\times r_2 = k\\).\n- Since \\(r_1 = 2\\) and \\(r_2 = 61\\):\n  \\[\n  k = 2 \\times 61 = 122\n  \\]\n  \n**Check:**\n\n- **Does this Make Sense?**\n  - The sum of the roots is \\(2 + 61 = 63\\), which matches the coefficient in the equation.\n  - The product \\(2 \\times 61 = 122\\), so \\(k = 122\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Everything checks out. The only value of \\(k\\) that satisfies both roots being prime is 122.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Other Possibilities**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- It\u2019s important to consider whether there might be other pairs of prime numbers that sum to 63. \n- However, we established that one of the primes must be 2 (the only even prime) to make the sum 63, and the other prime must be 61.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- Perhaps there are odd primes that can pair up to make 63, but that would require both primes to be odd, which is impossible since the sum of two odd numbers is even, and 63 is odd.\n\n- **Alternative Approach:**\n  - List all primes less than 63 and see which ones can pair with 2 to sum to 63.\n  - However, since 61 is the only prime that, when added to 2, equals 63, it reinforces that \\(k = 122\\) is the only solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This confirms that there are no other possible values for \\(k\\). \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The only possible value of \\(k\\) is 122.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check:**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Sum of roots: \\(2 + 61 = 63\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- Product of roots: \\(2 \\times 61 = 122\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- Both roots are prime: 2 and 61 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Everything aligns perfectly. There are no other pairs of prime numbers that sum to 63, and the calculations check out.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Final Answer:** There is **only one** possible value of \\(k\\), which is **122**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- By using Vieta\u2019s formulas, I quickly narrowed down the possible prime roots to (2, 61).\n- Checking the primality of 61 confirmed that both roots are indeed prime.\n- Calculating the product gave me \\(k = 122\\), and considering other possibilities reinforced that this is the only valid solution.\n- This step-by-step approach, along with constant reflection and checking, ensured that the answer is correct.\n\nOverall, this problem required a blend of theoretical understanding (Vieta\u2019s formulas) and practical verification (checking primality and possible prime pairs) to arrive at the correct answer.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $p$ and $q$ be two primes that are roots of $x^2 - 63 x + k = 0$. Then $$\nx^2 - 63 x + k = (x - p)(x - q) = x^2 - (p+q)x + p \\cdot q,\n$$ so $p + q = 63$ and $p\\cdot q=k$. Since $63$ is odd, one of the primes must be $2$ and the other $61$. Thus, there is exactly $\\boxed{1}$ possible value for $k$, namely $k = p\\cdot q = 2\\cdot 61=122$."
