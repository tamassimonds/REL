    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking if I'm on the right track. It\u2019s essential to approach this as I would if I were solving it myself, with all the brainstorming, reflecting, and occasionally backtracking that comes with it.\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nHmm, I see that we have a sequence of positive integers. Each term after the first is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the sum of the term before it and the term after it. We need to find the 5th term given that the 1st term is \\(2\\) and the 4th term is \\(34\\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- This reminds me of sequences where each term is related to its neighbors, possibly like a linear or quadratic sequence.\n- I wonder if setting up a recurrence relation might help.\n- Alternatively, perhaps writing out the terms step by step could reveal a pattern.\n- I could also think about whether this is similar to an arithmetic or geometric sequence.\n\n**Reflecting:**\n- The given relationship involves the sum of neighboring terms, which is not typical for simple arithmetic or geometric sequences.\n- Since each term depends on both its predecessor and successor, it seems more like a recursive sequence.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Setting Up a Recurrence Relation**\n- I could set up equations based on the given relationship.\n- Maybe express each term in terms of the others.\n\n**Strategy 2: Writing Out the Sequence Step by Step**\n- Start with the known terms and see if I can fill in the gaps.\n- This might help identify any patterns or relationships.\n\n**Strategy 3: Looking for Patterns or Fixed Points**\n- Maybe there's a fixed point or pattern in the sequence that makes it easier to solve.\n\n**Decision:**\nI think Strategy 2\u2014writing out the sequence step by step\u2014might be the most intuitive, especially since we have specific terms given. If that doesn\u2019t work, I can revisit Strategy 1.\n\n### **Implementing Strategy 2: Writing Out the Sequence**\n\n**Step 1: Expressing the Relationship Mathematically**\n- The problem states that each term after the first is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the sum of the term before it and the term after it.\n- Mathematically, this can be written as:\n  \\[\n  a_n = \\frac{1}{3}(a_{n-1} + a_{n+1})\n  \\]\n  \n  But rearranging it gives:\n  \\[\n  a_{n-1} - 3a_n + a_{n+1} = 0\n  \\]\n  \n  This looks like a second-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Okay, so each term is a weighted average of its neighbors.\n- Maybe I can use this relationship to express unknown terms in terms of known ones.\n\n**Step 2: Applying the Relationship to Known Terms**\n\nGiven:\n- \\(a_1 = 2\\)\n- \\(a_4 = 34\\)\n\nI need to find \\(a_5\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since the relationship involves three terms, I need to find at least one more term (either \\(a_2\\), \\(a_3\\), or both) to use the given information effectively.\n- I could start by trying to find \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_3\\) using the relationship and known terms.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- However, I don\u2019t have direct information about \\(a_2\\) or \\(a_3\\). This might lead to multiple possible sequences or require additional constraints.\n- But since the problem only provides two terms, perhaps there\u2019s a pattern or fixed relation that simplifies the process.\n\n**Step 3: Exploring Patterns or Fixed Points**\n\n**Idea:**\n- Maybe the sequence stabilizes or follows a specific pattern that doesn\u2019t require finding all intermediate terms.\n\n**Realization:**\n- Wait, thinking about fixed points: if every term is related to its neighbors, perhaps there's a constant ratio or additive pattern that can be leveraged.\n- However, without more information, this might be too abstract to apply directly.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n- Return to Strategy 1: Setting up a recurrence relation and solving for \\(a_5\\) using known terms.\n\n### **Implementing Strategy 1: Setting Up a Recurrence Relation**\n\n**Step 1: Writing the General Equation**\n- From the relationship:\n  \\[\n  a_{n-1} - 3a_n + a_{n+1} = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- Rearranged:\n  \\[\n  a_{n+1} = 3a_n - a_{n-1}\n  \\]\n  \n**Thoughts:**\n- This allows us to express the next term in terms of the current and previous terms.\n- It\u2019s a linear recurrence relation, which are generally solvable.\n\n**Step 2: Expressing \\(a_5\\) in Terms of Known Terms**\n\nTo find \\(a_5\\), I need \\(a_4\\) and \\(a_3\\).\n\n**Building Up:**\n- First, express \\(a_5\\) using \\(a_4\\) and \\(a_3\\):\n  \\[\n  a_5 = 3a_4 - a_3\n  \\]\n  \n- Next, express \\(a_4\\) using \\(a_3\\) and \\(a_2\\):\n  \\[\n  a_4 = 3a_3 - a_2\n  \\]\n  \n- Finally, express \\(a_3\\) using \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_1\\):\n  \\[\n  a_3 = 3a_2 - a_1\n  \\]\n  \n**Thought Process:**\n- This creates a chain of dependencies starting from \\(a_1\\).\n- However, I don't know \\(a_2\\), and the given information doesn't directly provide it. \n\n**Reflection:**\n- It seems like I need more information to proceed directly.\n- Maybe the problem expects me to identify a pattern or fixed relationship that doesn't require calculating each term individually.\n\n### **Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\n**Realization:**\n- Given that only \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_4\\) are known, and there's a linear recurrence relation, perhaps there\u2019s a global relationship or formula that can connect these terms without computing all intermediate ones.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Using Linear Algebra or Characteristic Equations**\n\n**Idea:**\n- In linear recurrence relations, the solution often involves finding characteristic equations or leveraging linear combinations to relate non-adjacent terms.\n\n**Applying Linear Recurrence Theory:**\n- The general solution for such relations involves finding roots of the characteristic equation, but that might be overcomplicating for this specific problem.\n\n**Simpler Insight:**\n- Maybe the sequence follows a specific pattern that can be deduced without solving the characteristic equation.\n\n**Alternative Insight:**\n- Since each term is a linear combination of its neighbors, perhaps the sequence evolves by repeatedly applying the same linear transformation. This might lead to a predictable pattern or ratio.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Go back to writing out the terms step by step, but this time, focus on seeing if a pattern emerges between the known terms that can be extrapolated to find \\(a_5\\).\n\n### **Retrying Strategy 2: Writing Out the Sequence Step by Step**\n\n**Step 1: Setting Up the Sequence**\n\nGiven:\n- \\(a_1 = 2\\)\n- \\(a_4 = 34\\)\n\nI need to find \\(a_5\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Perhaps I can set up equations using the recurrence relation to find \\(a_2\\), \\(a_3\\), and then \\(a_4\\) to check consistency.\n\n**Step 2: Expressing Terms Backwards**\n\nStart with the known term \\(a_4\\):\n\n\\[\na_4 = 3a_3 - a_2 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(a_4 = 34\\):\n\n\\[\n34 = 3a_3 - a_2 \\quad \\text{(1a)}\n\\]\n\n**Express \\(a_3\\):**\n\n\\[\na_3 = \\frac{a_2 + 34}{3} \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\n**Now, express \\(a_3\\) using \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_1\\):**\n\n\\[\na_3 = 3a_2 - a_1 \\quad \\text{(3)}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(a_1 = 2\\):\n\n\\[\na_3 = 3a_2 - 2 \\quad \\text{(3a)}\n\\]\n\n**Equating (2) and (3a):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2 + 34}{3} = 3a_2 - 2\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solving for \\(a_2\\)**\n\n**Solving the Equation:**\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\na_2 + 34 = 9a_2 - 6\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n\\[\n34 + 6 = 9a_2 - a_2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n40 = 8a_2\n\\]\n\n\\[\na_2 = \\frac{40}{8} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Okay, I've found \\(a_2 = 5\\).\n- Let's check if this makes sense with \\(a_3\\) and \\(a_4\\).\n\n**Step 4: Calculating \\(a_3\\)**\n\nUsing equation (3a):\n\n\\[\na_3 = 3(5) - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13\n\\]\n\n**Check Consistency with \\(a_4\\):**\n\nUsing equation (1a):\n\n\\[\n34 = 3(13) - 5 = 39 - 5 = 34\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n- Yes, it checks out. \\(a_4 = 34\\) is consistent.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating \\(a_5\\)**\n\nNow, using the relationship:\n\n\\[\na_5 = 3a_4 - a_3 = 3(34) - 13 = 102 - 13 = 89\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Let's quickly verify if this aligns with the recurrence relation.\n\n**Checking the Recurrence for \\(a_4\\) and \\(a_5\\):**\n\nFor \\(a_4\\):\n\n\\[\na_4 = \\frac{1}{3}(a_3 + a_5) = \\frac{1}{3}(13 + 89) = \\frac{102}{3} = 34\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This matches the given \\(a_4 = 34\\).\n- Therefore, the sequence is consistent with the recurrence relation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The 5th term \\(a_5\\) is **89**.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- Initially, I tried to set up a recurrence relation and express \\(a_5\\) in terms of \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_3\\), but without knowing \\(a_2\\), it was challenging.\n- By systematically writing out the sequence and solving for \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_3\\), I was able to find \\(a_5 = 89\\).\n- Reflecting along the way ensured that each step was consistent and aligned with the given terms.\n- Checking the calculations at each stage helped verify the correctness of the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe 5th term of the sequence is **89**.",
