    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem, thinking through it just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. It's all about exploring and reflecting to find the best path forward.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**User Query:**  \nThe product of \\(7d^2 - 3d + g\\) and \\(3d^2 + hd - 8\\) is \\(21d^4 - 44d^3 - 35d^2 + 14d - 16\\). What is \\(g + h\\)?\n\n**Initial Reflection:**  \nOkay, this looks like a polynomial multiplication problem. We've got two quadratics multiplied together, and we need to find the values of \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) that make their product equal a specific quartic polynomial. \n\nWhen I see problems like this, it reminds me of multiplying two binomials using the FOIL method, but here we have quadratics, so it\u2019s a bit more involved. \n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Expand the Product:** Multiply the two polynomials step by step to see if I can match the given quartic polynomial.\n2. **Use Polynomial Identity:** Set up an equation by equating coefficients of like terms since polynomials of equal degree must be equal.\n3. **Plug in Values:** Use specific values for \\(d\\) to create a system of equations for \\(g\\) and \\(h\\).\n\n**Which to Try First?**  \nI think starting with expanding the product makes sense because it directly relates to how polynomials multiply. If that gets too messy or doesn\u2019t lead anywhere, I can switch to equating coefficients or plugging in values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expanding the Product**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s expand \\( (7d^2 - 3d + g)(3d^2 + hd - 8) \\) using the distributive property. This should give me a polynomial where I can match coefficients with the given quartic polynomial.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(7d^2 - 3d + g)(3d^2 + hd - 8)\n\\]\n\n**Expanding term by term:**\n\n1. **Multiply \\(7d^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial:**\n   - \\(7d^2 \\times 3d^2 = 21d^4\\)\n   - \\(7d^2 \\times hd = 7hd^3\\)\n   - \\(7d^2 \\times -8 = -56d^2\\)\n\n2. **Multiply \\(-3d\\) by each term in the second polynomial:**\n   - \\(-3d \\times 3d^2 = -9d^3\\)\n   - \\(-3d \\times hd = -3hd^2\\)\n   - \\(-3d \\times -8 = 24d\\)\n\n3. **Multiply \\(g\\) by each term in the second polynomial:**\n   - \\(g \\times 3d^2 = 3gd^2\\)\n   - \\(g \\times hd = ghd\\)\n   - \\(g \\times -8 = -8g\\)\n\n**Combine All the Terms:**\n\n\\[\n21d^4 + (7h - 9)d^3 + (-56 - 3h + 3g)d^2 + (24 + gh)d - 8g\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, the expanded form is:\n\n\\[\n21d^4 + (7h - 9)d^3 + (-56 - 3h + 3g)d^2 + (24 + gh)d - 8g\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, I need to be careful here. The given quartic polynomial is:\n\n\\[\n21d^4 - 44d^3 - 35d^2 + 14d - 16\n\\]\n\nI should ensure that the coefficients match up correctly. Let me proceed to the next step and see if this approach is leading me in the right direction.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Equating Coefficients**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince both polynomials are equal, their corresponding coefficients must also be equal. I\u2019ll set up a system of equations by equating the coefficients of \\(d^4\\), \\(d^3\\), \\(d^2\\), \\(d\\), and the constant terms.\n\n**Setting Up Equations:**\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(d^4\\):**\n   \\[\n   21 = 21 \\quad (\\text{Already matches})\n   \\]\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\(d^3\\):**\n   \\[\n   7h - 9 = -44\n   \\]\n\n3. **Coefficient of \\(d^2\\):**\n   \\[\n   -56 - 3h + 3g = -35\n   \\]\n\n4. **Coefficient of \\(d\\):**\n   \\[\n   24 + gh = 14\n   \\]\n\n5. **Constant Term:**\n   \\[\n   -8g = -16\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe equation from the constant term is straightforward. Let me solve these equations step by step to find \\(g\\) and \\(h\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\(g\\) and \\(h\\)**\n\n**Solving the Constant Term:**\n\n\\[\n-8g = -16 \\implies g = 2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nHmm, that seems simple enough. Let\u2019s see if this value makes sense when plugged into the other equations.\n\n**Moving to the Coefficient of \\(d^3\\):**\n\n\\[\n7h - 9 = -44\n\\]\n\nAdd 9 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n7h = -35\n\\]\n\nDivide by 7:\n\n\\[\nh = -5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, so \\(g = 2\\) and \\(h = -5\\). Before I finalize this, let me plug these values back into the other equations to ensure consistency.\n\n**Plugging into the Coefficient of \\(d^2\\):**\n\n\\[\n-56 - 3(-5) + 3(2) = -56 + 15 + 6 = -35\n\\]\n\n**Matches:**  \nThe equation is:\n\n\\[\n-35 = -35 \\quad (\\text{Matches})\n\\]\n\n**Plugging into the Coefficient of \\(d\\):**\n\n\\[\n24 + (-5)(2) = 24 - 10 = 14\n\\]\n\n**Matches:**  \nThe equation is:\n\n\\[\n14 = 14 \\quad (\\text{Matches})\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll coefficients match perfectly with the given quartic polynomial. This suggests that our values for \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Check:**  \nBefore concluding, let's quickly recap:\n- **Coefficient of \\(d^4\\):** \\(21 = 21\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Coefficient of \\(d^3\\):** \\(7h - 9 = -44\\) \u21d2 \\(h = -5\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Coefficient of \\(d^2\\):** \\(-56 - 3(-5) + 3(2) = -35\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Coefficient of \\(d\\):** \\(24 - 10 = 14\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Constant Term:** \\(-8(2) = -16\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. The values \\(g = 2\\) and \\(h = -5\\) satisfy all the equations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\\[\ng + h = 2 + (-5) = -3\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nThis approach worked well by expanding the polynomials and equating coefficients, ensuring that all parts of the equation matched. Initially, I thought expanding would lead to a complicated path, but it actually provided a clear way to set up and solve for \\(g\\) and \\(h\\).\n\nIf I had started with plugging in values, it might have been more cumbersome, and using polynomial identities could have been an alternative, but equating coefficients proved to be efficient and straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{-3}\\)\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nThroughout this problem, I made sure to reflect and check my work after each step, ensuring that the path taken was correct and that the intermediate results were consistent.",
