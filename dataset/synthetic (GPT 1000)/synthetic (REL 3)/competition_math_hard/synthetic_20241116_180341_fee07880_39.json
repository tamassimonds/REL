    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just as I would if I were solving it manually. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my progress, and check my work along the way to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\nOkay, so the problem is about finding the sum of all positive integer solutions less than or equal to 20 for the congruence \\(13(3x - 2) \\equiv 26 \\pmod{8}\\).\n\n**What comes to mind:**\n- **Congruences:** This reminds me of solving linear congruences, which is something I've dealt with before.\n- **Simplification:** Maybe I should simplify the equation first to see if that makes it easier to solve.\n- **Modular Arithmetic:** I recall that working with modulus can sometimes reduce the complexity of the problem.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Simplify the Congruence:** Try to reduce both sides of the equation modulo 8.\n2. **Solve for \\(x\\):** Once simplified, solve the linear congruence for \\(x\\).\n3. **Check Solutions:** Verify that the solutions are within the specified range (1 to 20).\n4. **Sum the Solutions:** Add up all valid solutions.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does this make sense?** Simplifying the congruence seems like a logical first step. If it works, I can proceed with finding \\(x\\). If it doesn't, I might need to reconsider my approach.\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify the Congruence**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's start by simplifying the given congruence \\(13(3x - 2) \\equiv 26 \\pmod{8}\\). The goal is to make the equation easier to work with.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Distribute 13:** \n  \\[\n  13 \\times (3x - 2) = 39x - 26\n  \\]\n  \n- **Apply Modulo 8:**\n  \\[\n  39x - 26 \\equiv 26 \\pmod{8}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplify Each Term:**\n  - \\(39 \\mod 8 = 7\\) (since \\(39 - 32 = 7\\))\n  - \\(-26 \\mod 8 = 6\\) (because \\(-26 + 32 = 6\\))\n  \n- **Rewriting the Congruence:**\n  \\[\n  7x + 6 \\equiv 26 \\pmod{8}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Further Simplification:**\n  \\[\n  7x + 6 \\equiv 26 \\mod{8} \\rightarrow 7x + 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8} \\quad (\\text{since } 26 - 24 = 2)\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Is this simplified enough?** I think so. The coefficients are smaller, making it easier to solve for \\(x\\). But let me double-check the simplification steps to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- \\(39 \\mod 8\\) should be \\(7\\). Correct.\n- \\(-26 \\mod 8\\) is indeed \\(6\\). Correct.\n- So, \\(7x + 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}\\) seems right.\n\n### **Step 2: Solve for \\(x\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that the congruence is simplified to \\(7x + 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}\\), I need to solve for \\(x\\). This looks like a standard linear congruence problem.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Subtract 6 from Both Sides:**\n  \\[\n  7x \\equiv 2 - 6 \\pmod{8} \\rightarrow 7x \\equiv -4 \\pmod{8}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Convert \\(-4\\) to Positive Modulo 8:**\n  \\[\n  -4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8} \\quad (\\text{since } -4 + 8 = 4)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Now, the Congruence is:**\n  \\[\n  7x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Does this look right?** Subtracting 6 from both sides seems correct. Converting \\(-4\\) to \\(4\\) modulo 8 also checks out.\n- **Next Steps:** To solve for \\(x\\), I might need to find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 8. But let me think\u2014does 7 have an inverse modulo 8?\n\n### **Step 3: Check if 7 Has an Inverse Modulo 8**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore proceeding, I should confirm whether 7 has a multiplicative inverse modulo 8. If it doesn't, the equation might not have a solution.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Understanding Inverses:** An inverse of 7 modulo 8 would be a number \\(m\\) such that:\n  \\[\n  7m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Testing Possible Values:**\n  - \\(7 \\times 1 = 7 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}\\)\n  - \\(7 \\times 2 = 14 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{8}\\)\n  - \\(7 \\times 3 = 21 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}\\)\n  - \\(7 \\times 4 = 28 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}\\)\n  - \\(7 \\times 5 = 35 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{8}\\)\n  - \\(7 \\times 6 = 42 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}\\)\n  - \\(7 \\times 7 = 49 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}\\)\n  \n- **Conclusion:**\n  - **\\(7 \\times 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}\\):** So, 7 has an inverse, which is 7 itself.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Is this helpful?** Knowing that 7 has an inverse modulo 8 allows me to multiply both sides of the congruence by 7 to solve for \\(x\\).\n- **Next Steps:** Proceed to multiply both sides by 7 to find \\(x\\).\n\n### **Step 4: Multiply Both Sides by the Inverse**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nWith the inverse of 7 being 7 modulo 8, I can multiply both sides of the congruence \\(7x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}\\) by 7 to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Multiplying by 7:**\n  \\[\n  7 \\times 7x \\equiv 7 \\times 4 \\pmod{8} \\rightarrow 49x \\equiv 28 \\pmod{8}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplify Both Sides:**\n  - \\(49 \\mod 8 = 1\\) (since \\(49 - 48 = 1\\))\n  - \\(28 \\mod 8 = 4\\) (since \\(28 - 24 = 4\\))\n  \n- **Resulting Congruence:**\n  \\[\n  x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Is this correct?** Multiplying by the inverse seems to have worked perfectly. The solution \\(x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}\\) makes sense.\n- **Next Steps:** Now, I need to find all positive integer solutions less than or equal to 20. Let's list them out.\n\n### **Step 5: Find All Positive Integer Solutions \\(x \\leq 20\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe solution \\(x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}\\) means that \\(x\\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\nx = 4 + 8k\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is any integer. Since we're looking for positive solutions less than or equal to 20, I'll substitute different values of \\(k\\) to find all valid \\(x\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Listing Possible \\(k\\) Values:**\n  - \\(k = 0: x = 4 + 8 \\times 0 = 4\\)\n  - \\(k = 1: x = 4 + 8 \\times 1 = 12\\)\n  - \\(k = 2: x = 4 + 8 \\times 2 = 20\\)\n  - \\(k = 3: x = 4 + 8 \\times 3 = 28\\) (But 28 > 20, so ignore)\n\n- **Valid Solutions:**\n  \\[\n  x = 4, \\, 12, \\, 20\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Are these all the solutions?** Yes, since \\(k\\) must be a non-negative integer and \\(x\\) must be less than or equal to 20, \\(k = 0, 1, 2\\) give the valid solutions.\n- **Next Steps:** Sum these solutions as per the problem's requirement.\n\n### **Step 6: Sum the Valid Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe final requirement is to find the sum of all positive integer solutions \\(x \\leq 20\\). From the previous step, we have \\(x = 4, 12, 20\\). Adding them up should give the correct sum.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Summing the Solutions:**\n  \\[\n  4 + 12 + 20 = 36\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Does the sum make sense?** Adding these numbers straightforwardly seems correct. There are no hidden complexities here.\n- **Final Answer:** The sum of all positive integer solutions less than or equal to 20 is **36**.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore concluding, let's quickly review each step to ensure everything aligns correctly.\n\n**Checkpoints:**\n1. **Simplification Correct?** \n   - \\(13(3x - 2) \\equiv 26 \\pmod{8}\\) simplified to \\(7x + 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}\\). \u2714\ufe0f\n   \n2. **Solving for \\(x\\):**\n   - \\(7x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}\\) led to \\(x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}\\). \u2714\ufe0f\n   \n3. **Finding \\(x \\leq 20\\):**\n   - Solutions \\(x = 4, 12, 20\\) are all valid. \u2714\ufe0f\n   \n4. **Sum Calculation:**\n   - \\(4 + 12 + 20 = 36\\). \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Is everything consistent?** Yes, all steps logically follow each other, and the final sum makes sense.\n- **No Errors Detected:** The approach seems correct from start to finish.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy following a systematic approach\u2014simplifying the congruence, solving for \\(x\\), finding all valid solutions within the given range, and finally summing them up\u2014I arrived at the answer **36**. Throughout the process, I reflected and checked my work to ensure accuracy, making adjustments as needed. This step-by-step method ensured a thorough and correct solution.",
