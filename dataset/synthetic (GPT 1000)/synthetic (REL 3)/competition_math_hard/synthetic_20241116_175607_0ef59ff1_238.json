    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming various strategies, reflecting often to ensure I'm on the right track, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving this manually.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, so we have three positive integers \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) that satisfy the following equations:\n\\[\nab + c = bc + a = ac + b = 41\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( a + b + c \\).\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of systems of equations I've dealt with before. It's similar to problems where multiple expressions are equal, and you need to find relationships between the variables. However, seeing three equations set equal to each other is a bit unique.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Set Up Multiple Equations:**\n   - Since \\( ab + c = bc + a \\), I could set these two equal to each other and simplify.\n   - Do the same with the other pairs: \\( bc + a = ac + b \\) and \\( ac + b = ab + c \\).\n\n2. **Express One Variable in Terms of Others:**\n   - Maybe express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), then substitute back into the other equations.\n\n3. **Look for Symmetry:**\n   - Notice that the equations are symmetric in terms of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). Perhaps there's a pattern or simplification that takes advantage of this symmetry.\n\n4. **Substitution Method:**\n   - Substitute one equation into another to reduce the number of variables step by step.\n\n5. **Check for Integer Solutions:**\n   - Since \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are positive integers, maybe test small integer values to see if they fit.\n\n**Reflecting on the Strategies:**\n\nWait, setting up multiple equations seems like a straightforward starting point. I\u2019ll try that first and see where it leads. If it gets too messy or I hit a dead end, I can pivot to another strategy like substitution or testing integer solutions.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Setting Up Equations from Given Conditions**\n\nGiven:\n\\[\nab + c = bc + a = ac + b = 41\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s break this down:\n\n1. **From \\( ab + c = bc + a \\):**\n   \\[\n   ab + c = bc + a\n   \\]\n   Subtract \\( a \\) and \\( bc \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   ab - bc + c - a = 0\n   \\]\n   Rearranged:\n   \\[\n   a(b - 1) = c(b - 1)\n   \\]\n   \n2. **From \\( bc + a = ac + b \\):**\n   \\[\n   bc + a = ac + b\n   \\]\n   Subtract \\( b \\) and \\( ac \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   bc - ac + a - b = 0\n   \\]\n   Rearranged:\n   \\[\n   c(b - a) = b - a\n   \\]\n   \n3. **From \\( ac + b = ab + c \\):**\n   \\[\n   ac + b = ab + c\n   \\]\n   Subtract \\( c \\) and \\( ab \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   ac - ab + b - c = 0\n   \\]\n   Rearranged:\n   \\[\n   a(c - b) = c - b\n   \\]\n\n**Reflecting on These Rearrangements:**\n\nHmm, I see that all three equations can be factored to show relationships between \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). Specifically:\n\n1. **First Equation:** \\( a(b - 1) = c(b - 1) \\)\n2. **Second Equation:** \\( c(b - a) = b - a \\)\n3. **Third Equation:** \\( a(c - b) = c - b \\)\n\nWait a minute! This suggests that if \\( b - 1 \\neq 0 \\), then \\( a = c \\); similarly, if \\( b - a \\neq 0 \\), then \\( c = b \\); and if \\( c - b \\neq 0 \\), then \\( a = b \\). But since \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are positive integers, perhaps two of them are equal, and the third one is different.\n\n**Checking for Consistency:**\n\nLet\u2019s assume \\( a = b \\). Then the equations simplify significantly. But before making assumptions, let's proceed carefully to see if it leads to a contradiction or a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Exploring the Case \\( a = b = c \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens if \\( a = b = c \\).\n\nFrom the original equations:\n\\[\nab + c = bc + a = ac + b = 41\n\\]\nIf \\( a = b = c \\), then:\n\\[\na^2 + a = 41\n\\]\nSolving for \\( a \\):\n\\[\na^2 + a - 41 = 0\n\\]\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\\[\na = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4 \\times 41}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{165}}{2}\n\\]\nWait, \\( \\sqrt{165} \\) is not an integer, so \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) cannot all be equal. This means \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are distinct, or at least two of them are equal.\n\n**Reflecting on This Approach:**\n\nHmm, assuming all three are equal leads us to a non-integer solution, which contradicts the problem statement that \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are positive integers. Therefore, \\( a = b = c \\) is not a valid case.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Strategy:**\n\nSince assuming \\( a = b = c \\) doesn't work, perhaps one of the other cases where exactly two variables are equal might be the key.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that two of the variables are equal, say \\( a = b \\neq c \\), and see if that leads to a consistent solution.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Considering the Case \\( a = b \\neq c \\)**\n\nAssume \\( a = b \\). Let's see how this affects the equations.\n\nGiven:\n\\[\nab + c = bc + a = ac + b = 41\n\\]\nSince \\( a = b \\), we can substitute \\( b \\) with \\( a \\) in the equations.\n\n1. **Substitute into \\( ab + c = bc + a \\):**\n   \\[\n   a \\cdot a + c = a \\cdot c + a\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + c = ac + a\n   \\]\n   Rearranged:\n   \\[\n   a^2 - a = ac - c \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a(a - 1) = c(a - 1)\n   \\]\n   If \\( a \\neq 1 \\), then:\n   \\[\n   a = c\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute into \\( bc + a = ac + b \\):**\n   \\[\n   a \\cdot a + a = a \\cdot c + a\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + a = ac + a\n   \\]\n   Cancel \\( a \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   a^2 = ac \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = c \\quad (\\text{assuming } a \\neq 0)\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Substitute into \\( ac + b = ab + c \\):**\n   \\[\n   a \\cdot c + a = a \\cdot a + c\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   ac + a = a^2 + c\n   \\]\n   Rearranged:\n   \\[\n   ac - a = a^2 - c \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a(c - 1) = a^2 - c\n   \\]\n   \n**Analyzing the Results:**\n\nFrom the first two equations, we consistently arrive at \\( a = c \\). However, the third equation introduces a relationship between \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) that seems redundant since we've already established \\( a = c \\).\n\n**Checking for Consistency:**\n\nWait, if \\( a = b \\) and \\( a = c \\), then \\( a = b = c \\). This contradicts our earlier conclusion that \\( a = b = c \\) leads to a non-integer solution. So, this case also leads us back to the situation where all three variables are equal, which isn't feasible.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Strategy:**\n\nIt seems that assuming \\( a = b \\neq c \\) doesn't help in finding a valid integer solution. Perhaps, instead of assuming equality among variables, we should explore their relationships differently.\n\nMaybe considering the case where all three variables are distinct but possibly applying some identity or factoring might work.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Exploring Factoring and Symmetry**\n\nLet\u2019s revisit the original equations:\n\\[\nab + c = bc + a = ac + b = 41\n\\]\n\nNotice that these equations are symmetric in \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). This symmetry might allow us to factor the equations or find a relationship between the variables that simplifies the problem.\n\n**Idea: Express Each Equation Differently**\n\nLet\u2019s attempt to express each equation in terms of their differences.\n\n1. **From \\( ab + c = 41 \\):**\n   \\[\n   c = 41 - ab\n   \\]\n   \n2. **From \\( bc + a = 41 \\):**\n   \\[\n   a = 41 - bc\n   \\]\n   \n3. **From \\( ac + b = 41 \\):**\n   \\[\n   b = 41 - ac\n   \\]\n\n**Check Consistency:**\n\nWait, substituting these into each other seems complicated. Perhaps there's a better way to use symmetry.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Sum of Equations**\n\nAnother idea is to add all three equations together to see if we can find a relationship.\n\nAdding all three:\n\\[\n(ab + c) + (bc + a) + (ac + b) = 3 \\times 41\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nab + bc + ac + a + b + c = 123\n\\]\nWait, this sums up all the terms and doesn't immediately help in isolating \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). It might be better to explore another path.\n\n**Re-evaluating:**\n\nHmm, adding the equations doesn't directly lead to a solution. Perhaps looking for common factors or identities might be the way forward.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Looking for Common Factors**\n\nLet's re-examine the original equations for common patterns or factors.\n\nRecall the rearranged equations:\n1. \\( a(b - 1) = c(b - 1) \\)\n2. \\( c(b - a) = b - a \\)\n3. \\( a(c - b) = c - b \\)\n\n**Observations:**\n\nWait, if \\( b - 1 \\neq 0 \\), then \\( a = c \\); if \\( b - a \\neq 0 \\), then \\( c = b \\); and if \\( c - b \\neq 0 \\), then \\( a = b \\).\n\nThis suggests that unless \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are such that at least two of them differ by 1 (specifically, \\( b = a + 1 \\) or similar), they must be equal, which contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n\n**Possible Insight:**\n\nMaybe the only integer solution arises when there's a specific relationship like \\( a = b \\pm 1 \\) or similar.\n\n**Wait, let\u2019s test this idea:**\n\nSuppose \\( a = b + 1 \\) or \\( a = b - 1 \\), and see if it leads to a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Testing \\( a = b + 1 \\)**\n\nLet's assume \\( a = b + 1 \\). See if this leads to a consistent solution.\n\nGiven:\n\\[\nab + c = bc + a = ac + b = 41\n\\]\nFrom \\( a = b + 1 \\), substitute into the equations.\n\n1. **Substitute into \\( ab + c = 41 \\):**\n   \\[\n   (b + 1)b + c = 41 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b^2 + b + c = 41 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c = 41 - b^2 - b\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute into \\( bc + a = 41 \\):**\n   \\[\n   b(41 - b^2 - b) + (b + 1) = 41 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 41b - b^3 - b^2 + b + 1 = 41\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   -b^3 - b^2 + 42b + 1 - 41 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -b^3 - b^2 + 42b - 40 = 0\n   \\]\n   Multiplying by -1 to simplify:\n   \\[\n   b^3 + b^2 - 42b + 40 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflecting on This Polynomial:**\n\nWait, this is a cubic equation in terms of \\( b \\). Solving cubic equations can be tricky, but since we're looking for integer solutions, perhaps we can factor it or use the rational root theorem.\n\n**Factoring Attempt:**\n\nLet's try to factor this polynomial to find possible integer values of \\( b \\).\n\nThe equation is:\n\\[\nb^3 + b^2 - 42b + 40 = 0\n\\]\nPossible rational roots could be factors of 40. Let's list them: \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 5, \\pm 8, \\pm 10, \\pm 20, \\pm 40 \\).\n\n**Testing Possible Roots:**\n\nLet's test \\( b = 1 \\):\n\\[\n1^3 + 1^2 - 42(1) + 40 = 1 + 1 - 42 + 40 = 0\n\\]\nWait, \\( b = 1 \\) is a root. This suggests that \\( b = 1 \\) is a possible solution.\n\n**If \\( b = 1 \\):**\n\nThen \\( a = b + 1 = 2 \\), and from \\( c = 41 - b^2 - b \\):\n\\[\nc = 41 - 1 - 1 = 39\n\\]\nSo, \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), \\( c = 39 \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet's verify if these values satisfy all three original equations.\n\n1. **First Equation:**\n   \\[\n   ab + c = 2 \\cdot 1 + 39 = 2 + 39 = 41 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Second Equation:**\n   \\[\n   bc + a = 1 \\cdot 39 + 2 = 39 + 2 = 41 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Third Equation:**\n   \\[\n   ac + b = 2 \\cdot 39 + 1 = 78 + 1 = 79 \\quad \\text{(False)}\n   \\]\n   \n**Identifying the Issue:**\n\nWait a minute! While \\( ab + c = 41 \\) and \\( bc + a = 41 \\) hold true, \\( ac + b \\neq 41 \\) with this solution. This inconsistency suggests that assuming \\( a = b + 1 \\) leads to a partial solution, but not all equations are satisfied.\n\n**Reflecting on the Findings:**\n\nHmm, assuming \\( a = b + 1 \\) doesn't satisfy all three equations simultaneously. Perhaps \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) need to be different by a certain amount, or maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Strategy:**\n\nSince \\( a = b + 1 \\) led to inconsistency, perhaps we should consider a different relationship between \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nLet\u2019s explore another case where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are distinct but still satisfy the original equations.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Considering \\( a = b + k \\) where \\( k \\neq 1 \\)**\n\nLet's generalize the previous attempt by letting \\( a = b + k \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer different from 1. This way, we can see if there are other potential relationships that would work.\n\nGiven:\n\\[\nab + c = bc + a = ac + b = 41\n\\]\nFrom \\( a = b + k \\), substitute into the equations.\n\n1. **Substitute into \\( ab + c = 41 \\):**\n   \\[\n   (b + k)b + c = 41 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b^2 + kb + c = 41 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c = 41 - b^2 - kb\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute into \\( bc + a = 41 \\):**\n   \\[\n   b(41 - b^2 - kb) + (b + k) = 41\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   41b - b^3 - kb + b + k = 41 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -b^3 - kb + 42b + k - 41 = 0\n   \\]\n   Multiplying by -1 to simplify:\n   \\[\n   b^3 + kb - 42b - k + 41 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflecting on This Polynomial:**\n\nWait, this is another cubic equation, but with an added variable \\( k \\). Solving cubics can be complex, and introducing \\( k \\) might complicate things further without promising a clear path.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Strategy:**\n\nHmm, introducing \\( k \\) hasn't led us closer to a solution and makes the equation more complex. Maybe a different approach is needed.\n\nLet\u2019s consider another method that can leverage the symmetry without complicating the equations further.\n\n---\n\n**Step 8: Leveraging Symmetry and Factoring**\n\nLet\u2019s attempt to leverage the symmetry in the equations to find a relationship without assuming specific equality among variables.\n\nRecall the original equations:\n\\[\nab + c = bc + a = ac + b = 41\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s set up the equations based on differences, which previously led us to potential equalities:\n1. \\( a(b - 1) = c(b - 1) \\)\n2. \\( c(b - a) = b - a \\)\n3. \\( a(c - b) = c - b \\)\n\nSince assuming \\( a = b \\) or \\( a = b + 1 \\) led to inconsistencies, perhaps we need to find a different relationship that satisfies all three equations simultaneously.\n\n**Possible Insight:**\n\nWait, what if \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are consecutive integers? This could potentially satisfy the symmetric nature of the equations. Let\u2019s test this idea.\n\n**Assuming \\( a, b, c \\) are Consecutive Integers:**\n\nLet\u2019s say \\( a = n \\), \\( b = n + 1 \\), \\( c = n + 2 \\) or similar.\n\nHowever, testing this would require checking all permutations, which might be cumbersome. Instead, let's see if there's a simpler pattern that can emerge.\n\n**Maybe simplifying the equations further could help:**\n\nLet\u2019s take one of the rearranged equations:\n\\[\na(b - 1) = c(b - 1)\n\\]\nIf \\( b \\neq 1 \\), then \\( a = c \\), which might again lead us back to the situation where two variables are equal, causing inconsistency with the third equation.\n\n**Thus, perhaps \\( b = 1 \\) is necessary for a valid solution.**\n\nWait, so if \\( b = 1 \\), then:\n\\[\na(b - 1) = c(b - 1) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a(1 - 1) = c(1 - 1) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 0 = 0\n\\]\nThis is always true, meaning no new information is gained.\n\n**Re-evaluating:**\n\nHmm, setting \\( b = 1 \\) simplifies things but doesn't immediately provide a solution for \\( a \\) and \\( c \\). Maybe instead of assuming \\( a = b \\) or \\( a = b + 1 \\), we should consider \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) being distinct integers where one is a multiple of the others.\n\n**Alternative Insight:**\n\nWait, what if one of the variables is a multiple of the others? Given the equations, perhaps testing small integer values could lead to a pattern.\n\nInstead of trying to establish a general relationship, let's attempt to solve for specific integer values that satisfy all three equations.\n\nPerhaps leveraging the fact that \\( ab + c = bc + a = ac + b \\) suggests that certain additive relationships between \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) must hold.\n\n---\n\n**Step 9: Exploring Specific Integer Values**\n\nLet\u2019s explore specific integer values to see if we can find a consistent solution.\n\nGiven:\n\\[\nab + c = bc + a = ac + b = 41\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s assume \\( b = 1 \\) and see if it leads to a solution.\n\n**Assuming \\( b = 1 \\):**\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\\[\na(1) + c = 41 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a + c = 41\n\\]\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[\n1 \\cdot c + a = 41 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c + a = 41\n\\]\nFrom the third equation:\n\\[\na \\cdot 1 + c = 41 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a + c = 41\n\\]\nWait, all three equations reduce to \\( a + c = 41 \\). This consistency suggests that \\( a + c = 41 \\) must hold true when \\( b = 1 \\).\n\n**Proceeding with \\( b = 1 \\):**\n\nGiven \\( a + c = 41 \\) and \\( b = 1 \\), let\u2019s substitute these into one of the equations to find \\( a \\) and \\( c \\).\n\nLet\u2019s use the first equation:\n\\[\nab + c = 41 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a(1) + c = 41 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a + c = 41\n\\]\nThis doesn\u2019t provide new information, so we need more constraints.\n\n**Maybe assuming \\( a \\neq c \\) could help:**\n\nIf \\( a \\neq c \\), then we can explore different values of \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) that sum to 41, but we still need to satisfy \\( ac + b = 41 \\).\n\nGiven \\( b = 1 \\):\n\\[\nac + 1 = 41 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad ac = 40\n\\]\nSo, \\( a c = 40 \\) and \\( a + c = 41 \\).\n\n**Now, we have a system of equations:**\n\n1. \\( a + c = 41 \\)\n2. \\( a c = 40 \\)\n\nWe can solve this system to find integer values of \\( a \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n**Solving the System:**\n\nWait, let me think about this. We have two equations:\n\\[\na + c = 41 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a c = 40\n\\]\nWe can solve for \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) using substitution or elimination. Alternatively, recognizing that these are the sum and product of roots, we can set up a quadratic equation.\n\nLet\u2019s set up a quadratic equation based on these:\n\nLet \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) be the roots. The quadratic equation is:\n\\[\nx^2 - (a + c)x + ac = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x^2 - 41x + 40 = 0\n\\]\nWait, this seems correct. Let me check.\n\n\\( x^2 - 41x + 40 = 0 \\)\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{41 \\pm \\sqrt{41^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 40}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{41 \\pm \\sqrt{1681 - 160}}{2} = \\frac{41 \\pm \\sqrt{1521}}{2}\n\\]\nWait, \\( \\sqrt{1521} = 39 \\), so:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{41 \\pm 39}{2}\n\\]\nThis gives us:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{80}{2} = 40 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\n\\]\nSo, the roots are \\( a = 40 \\), \\( c = 1 \\) or vice versa (\\( a = 1 \\), \\( c = 40 \\)).\n\n**Checking the Solution:**\n\nLet\u2019s verify if \\( a = 40 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = 1 \\) satisfy all three original equations.\n\n1. **First Equation:**\n   \\[\n   ab + c = 40 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 40 + 1 = 41 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Second Equation:**\n   \\[\n   bc + a = 1 \\cdot 1 + 40 = 1 + 40 = 41 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Third Equation:**\n   \\[\n   ac + b = 40 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 40 + 1 = 41 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n   \\]\n   \n**Consistency:**\n\nWait, all three equations are satisfied with \\( a = 40 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = 1 \\). This seems like a valid solution.\n\n**Reflecting on the Solution:**\n\nHmm, initially, I considered that \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) had to be distinct, but through exploring different relationships and recognizing that \\( b = 1 \\) simplifies the system, I arrived at a solution where \\( a = 40 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = 1 \\).\n\n**Checking for Other Possible Solutions:**\n\nBut wait, does this mean there are no other solutions? Perhaps verifying if other values of \\( b \\neq 1 \\) lead to inconsistencies would provide clarity.\n\nLet\u2019s briefly consider \\( b \\neq 1 \\):\n\nIf \\( b \\neq 1 \\), then from \\( a(b - 1) = c(b - 1) \\), we would have \\( a = c \\), which would lead to \\( a = c \\) and potentially \\( a c = 40 \\) and \\( a + c = 41 \\), which would again lead us back to \\( a = 40 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), \\( c = 1 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWait, so regardless of whether \\( b = 1 \\) or \\( b \\neq 1 \\), the only consistent solution that satisfies all three equations is \\( a = 40 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = 1 \\).\n\n**Thus, the value of \\( a + b + c \\) is:**\n\\[\na + b + c = 40 + 1 + 1 = 42\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflecti\ud835\udc5b:**\n\nReflecting on the entire process:\n\n- Initially, I considered setting up multiple equations and exploring different cases of variable equality.\n- Assuming \\( a = b \\) led to non-integer solutions, while \\( a = b + 1 \\) resulted in inconsistencies.\n- Recognizing the symmetry in the equations and setting \\( b = 1 \\) simplified the system significantly.\n- By solving the resulting system, I found a consistent solution where \\( a = 40 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = 1 \\).\n- This satisfies all three original equations, leading to the correct value of \\( a + b + c = 42 \\).\n\nThroughout the process, checking the consistency of each step was crucial. Whenever an assumption led to contradictions, I re-evaluated and adjusted the strategy until I arrived at a valid solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{42}\n\\]",

Since $41$ is prime and $a$ and $c$ are positive integers, either $a=1$ or $a=41$. Note that if $a=41$, then $c+1 = 1 \\Rightarrow c=0$, a contradiction with the fact that $c$ is positive. Thus, $a=b=1 \\Rightarrow c+1=41 \\Rightarrow c=40$. Therefore $a+b+c = \\boxed{42}$"
