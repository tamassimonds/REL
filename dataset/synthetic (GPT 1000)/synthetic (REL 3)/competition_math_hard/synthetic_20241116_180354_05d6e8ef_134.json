    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll try to reflect my natural thought process, including brainstorming different strategies, checking my work along the way, and adjusting my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I notice it's about a **frustum of a right circular cone**. Specifically:\n\n- There's an **altitude (height) of 24 cm** for the frustum.\n- The **lower base area** is \\(225\\pi \\, \\text{sq cm}\\).\n- The **upper base area** is \\(25\\pi \\, \\text{sq cm}\\).\n- We need to find the **altitude of the small cone that was cut off**.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- This looks like a problem involving **similar triangles** or perhaps the **volume ratio** of cones and frustums.\n- I remember that in similar shapes, the ratios of corresponding dimensions (like heights) are equal to the ratios of their linear measurements (like radii).\n- Maybe I could use the formula for the volume of a frustum to relate these areas and heights.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Let\u2019s brainstorm a bit.\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Volume Approach:**  \n   Use the volume formulas for cones and frustums to set up an equation involving their volumes.\n\n2. **Similar Triangles Approach:**  \n   Since the frustum is formed by cutting a smaller cone from a larger one, perhaps the triangles (or their correspondings) are similar, and I can set up ratios between their heights and radii.\n\n3. **Area Ratios:**  \n   Use the given area of the bases to find the radii and then relate them to the heights using similar triangles.\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...**  \nAt first glance, using the volume approach seems complicated without additional information about the radii or heights other than what's given for the frustum. Maybe it's better to start with the areas to find the radii and proceed from there.\n\n**Let\u2019s try the **Similar Triangles Approach** first.**\n\n### **Step 1: Relating Areas to Radii**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- The area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius:  \n  \\[ A = \\pi r^2 \\]\n- Given the lower and upper base areas of the frustum, I can find the radii of both bases.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Lower base area:**  \n  \\[ 225\\pi = \\pi r_1^2 \\]  \n  - Dividing both sides by \\( \\pi \\):  \n    \\[ r_1^2 = 225 \\]  \n    \\[ r_1 = 15 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\n- **Upper base area:**  \n  \\[ 25\\pi = \\pi r_2^2 \\]  \n  - Dividing both sides by \\( \\pi \\):  \n    \\[ r_2^2 = 25 \\]  \n    \\[ r_2 = 5 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThis makes sense because the areas given are proportional to the squares of the radii. The calculations seem correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow that I know the radii, I can use the similar triangles property to relate the heights of the cones.\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Similar Triangles**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- The frustum is formed by cutting a smaller cone from a larger cone.\n- The triangles (or sections of them) are similar because they have the same shape but different sizes.\n- Therefore, the ratios of their corresponding heights are equal to the ratios of their radii.\n\n**Let\u2019s set up the ratio:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{h_{small}}{h_{large}} = \\frac{r_{small}}{r_{large}} = \\frac{h_{frustum}}{h_{large}}\n\\]\n\n**Where:**\n\n- \\( h_{small} \\) = height of the small cone cut off\n- \\( h_{large} \\) = height of the original larger cone\n- \\( h_{frustum} \\) = height of the frustum = \\( 24 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n- \\( r_{small} = r_2 = 5 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n- \\( r_{large} = r_1 = 15 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{h_{small}}{h_{large}} = \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**But wait, I need the height of the larger cone (\\( h_{large} \\)) to find \\( h_{small} \\)).**\n\n**Hmm, maybe I need to relate the height of the larger cone to the frustum's height and the small cone's height.**\n\n**Realization:**  \nThe height of the larger cone is the sum of the height of the frustum and the height of the small cone:\n\n\\[\nh_{large} = h_{frustum} + h_{small}\n\\]\n\n**So, I can substitute this into the ratio:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{h_{small}}{h_{frustum} + h_{small}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Let's set up the equation:**\n\n\\[\nh_{small} = \\frac{1}{3}(24 + h_{small})\n\\]\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\( h_{small} \\)**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nh_{small} = \\frac{1}{3}(24 + h_{small})\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\n3h_{small} = 24 + h_{small}\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( h_{small} \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n3h_{small} - h_{small} = 24\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n2h_{small} = 24\n\\]\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n\\[\nh_{small} = 12 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense?\n\n- If the height of the small cone is 12 cm, then the height of the larger cone \\( h_{large} \\) is:\n\n  \\[\n  h_{large} = h_{frustum} + h_{small} = 24 + 12 = 36 \\, \\text{cm}\n  \\]\n\n- The ratio of the heights should match the ratio of the radii:\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{h_{small}}{h_{large}} = \\frac{12}{36} = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n\n- The ratio of the radii is:\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{r_{small}}{r_{large}} = \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{1}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth ratios are equal, confirming that the calculations are consistent. The approach seems correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- I used the property of similar triangles to relate the heights and radii.\n- By knowing the radii and the height of the frustum, I solved for the height of the small cone.\n- The ratio checks out, and the dimensions make sense.\n\n**Random Insight:**  \nAt this point, I'm feeling confident that the height of the small cone is indeed 12 cm. The method worked, and the checks confirm its validity.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nLet me briefly ensure I didn't overlook anything:\n\n- The areas provided were correctly translated into radii.\n- The similarity ratio was correctly applied.\n- The equations were solved step by step without errors.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies, trying the similar triangles approach, and verifying the calculations and ratios, I conclude that the altitude of the small cone that was cut off is **12 centimeters**.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- **Understanding Similarity:** Recognizing that the shapes involved are similar was crucial.\n- **Correct Application of Ratios:** Applying the ratio of heights and radii accurately led to the correct solution.\n- **Importance of Verification:** Checking the consistency of ratios ensured the correctness of the result.\n\nThank you for guiding me through this problem step by step. Writing it out naturally, reflecting on the process, and verifying each part ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The two bases are circles, and the area of a circle is $\\pi r^2$. If the area of the upper base (which is also the base of the small cone) is $25\\pi$ sq cm, then its radius is $5$ cm, and the radius of the lower base is $15$ cm.   The upper base, therefore, has a radius that is $\\frac{1}{3}$ the size of the radius of the smaller base.  Because the slope of the sides of a cone is uniform, the frustum must have been cut off $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the way up the cone, so $x$ is $\\frac13$ of the total height of the cone, $H$.  We can now solve for $x$, because we know that the height of the frustum, $24$ cm is $\\frac23$ of the total height. \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{2}{3}H&=24\\\\\nH&=36\\\\\nx&=H\\times\\frac{1}{3}\\\\\nx&=36\\times\\frac{1}{3}\\\\\nx&=12\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the height of the small cone is $\\boxed{12}$ centimeters."
