The question asks us to find the number of diagonals in a convex polygon with 20 sides. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems I've encountered before involving polygons and their properties. I recall there being a formula for calculating the number of diagonals, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\n- **Brainstorming Ideas:**\n  1. **Recall a Formula:** Maybe there's a direct formula that can be applied.\n  2. **Visualize the Polygon:** Try drawing a smaller polygon to see the pattern.\n  3. **Consider Combinatorial Methods:** Perhaps using combinations to select pairs of vertices.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:** Let's start by recalling any formulas we might know. If that doesn't work, I'll move on to visualizing smaller cases.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n**1.1 Recall a Formula:**\n\n- **Thought Process:** I vaguely remember that there's a formula involving the number of sides, but I'm not entirely sure what it is. Is it something like \\( n(n-3)/2 \\)? \n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, that sounds familiar, but I need to double-check. Maybe looking it up would help, but since I need to rely on my own reasoning, let's see if it makes sense.\n\n**1.2 Visualize with a Smaller Polygon:**\n\n- **Idea:** Let's take a smaller convex polygon, like a hexagon (6 sides), and count the diagonals manually to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n- **Thought Process:** If I can confirm the formula with a smaller case, I'll feel more confident applying it to a 20-sided polygon.\n\n**1.3 Consider Combinatorial Methods:**\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Another idea is to think about selecting pairs of vertices and subtracting the sides since diagonals connect non-adjacent vertices.\n\n- **Reflection:** This sounds promising. In combinatorics, selecting pairs usually involves combinations, so maybe that's the path to take.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Testing the Formula with a Smaller Polygon**\n\n**2.1 Choose a Hexagon (6 Sides):**\n\n- **Action:** Let's see if the formula \\( n(n-3)/2 \\) works for a hexagon.\n\n- **Calculation:** \n  \\[\n  n = 6 \\\\\n  \\text{Diagonals} = \\frac{6(6-3)}{2} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9\n  \\]\n- **Thought Process:** According to the formula, a hexagon should have 9 diagonals.\n\n**2.2 Verify by Drawing:**\n\n- **Action:** Let's list or draw the diagonals to confirm.\n\n- **Listing Diagonals:**\n  - From vertex 1: connects to 3, 4, 5\n  - From vertex 2: connects to 4, 5, 6\n  - From vertex 3: connects to 5, 6\n  - From vertex 4: connects to 6\n\n- **Count:** Total = 9 diagonals\n\n- **Reflection:** The formula works for a hexagon! This gives me confidence to apply it to a 20-sided polygon.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Formula to a 20-Sided Polygon**\n\n**3.1 Set Up the Calculation:**\n\n- **Formula:** \n  \\[\n  \\text{Diagonals} = \\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\n  \\]\n  where \\( n = 20 \\).\n\n- **Thought Process:** Plugging in the numbers should give me the total number of diagonals.\n\n**3.2 Perform the Calculation:**\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Diagonals} = \\frac{20(20-3)}{2} = \\frac{20 \\times 17}{2} = \\frac{340}{2} = 170\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** The computation seems straightforward. Let's pause and think if this number makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**4.1 Quick Check:**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Does 170 sound reasonable for a 20-sided polygon? Given that larger polygons have significantly more diagonals, this number seems plausible.\n\n- **Alternative Check:** Maybe calculate the number of possible line segments and subtract the sides to ensure correctness.\n\n**4.2 Using Combinatorial Method:**\n\n- **Idea:** Total number of line segments connecting any two vertices is \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\). From this, subtract the number of sides (\\( n \\)) to get the number of diagonals.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total line segments} = \\binom{20}{2} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Diagonals} = 190 - 20 = 170\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** This matches our previous result. Using a different method confirms that 170 is indeed correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n**5.1 Is the Answer Consistent?**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Both the formula and the combinatorial approach yield the same result. This consistency strengthens the validity of the answer.\n\n**5.2 Does It Make Sense Physically?**\n\n- **Reflection:** A convex polygon with many sides should have a substantial number of diagonals, and 170 sounds reasonable for a 20-sided figure.\n\n**5.3 Final Check:**\n\n- **Quick Mental Math:** Recalling that each vertex connects to \\( n-3 \\) other vertices (excluding itself and its two neighbors), and dividing by 2 to avoid double-counting, aligns well with our formula.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **By thoroughly exploring different strategies, verifying each step, and reflecting on the plausibility of the results, we arrived confidently at the correct answer.**\n\nAlright, let's put it all together into a smooth and cohesive solution, incorporating the original thought process but minimizing any unnecessary back-and-forth.

Let's pause and think if this number makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**4.1 Quick Check:**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Does 170 sound reasonable for a 20-sided polygon? Given that larger polygons have significantly more diagonals, this number seems plausible.\n\n- **Alternative Check:** Maybe calculate the number of possible line segments and subtract the sides to ensure correctness.\n\n**4.2 Using Combinatorial Method:**\n\n- **Idea:** Total number of line segments connecting any two vertices is \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\). From this, subtract the number of sides (\\( n \\)) to get the number of diagonals.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total line segments} = \\binom{20}{2} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Diagonals} = 190 - 20 = 170\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** This matches our previous result. Using a different method confirms that 170 is indeed correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n**5.1 Is the Answer Consistent?**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Both the formula and the combinatorial approach yield the same result.

A convex polygon with 20 sides indeed has 170 diagonals.",
  "ground_truth": "For each of the 20 vertices of the polygon, there are 17 other nonadjacent vertices that we can connect the original vertex with to form a diagonal.  However, multiplying 20 by 17 would count each diagonal twice---once for each of the diagonal's endpoints. We must divide the result by 2 to correct for this, so the answer is $(20\\cdot 17)/2=\\boxed{170}$."
