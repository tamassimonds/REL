  "problem": "Misha is the 50th best as well as the 50th worst student in her grade. How many students are in Misha's grade?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem just like how a human would\u2014starting with brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and checking our work along the way. Here's my natural approach:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, Misha is both the 50th best and the 50th worst student in her grade. At first glance, this suggests there's an equal number of students better and worse than her. But wait, does that mean there are no students tied with her in ranking? Hmm, let me think this through.\n\nThis reminds me of problems involving rankings and positions within a list. Maybe visualizing it or writing out the positions will help me get a clearer idea.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Linear Visualization:**  \n   Imagine a lineup of students ordered by their performance. Misha's position should give clues about the total number of students.\n\n2. **Mathematical Equation:**  \n   Set up an equation based on her ranking positions to solve for the total number of students.\n\n3. **Check for Ties:**  \n   Consider whether there are ties in the rankings, which might affect the total count.\n\nLet me start with the **linear visualization** strategy. If it doesn't work, I'll pivot to another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Linear Visualization**\n\n**Step 1:**  \nThink of a straight line of students ranked from best to worst. Misha is the 50th best, so there are 49 students better than her.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAlright, being the 50th best means there are 49 students ahead. But she's also the 50th worst? That implies there are 49 students worse than her too.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute\u2014if there are 49 students better and 49 worse, plus Misha herself, that sums up to... Let me calculate.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n49 (better) + 1 (Misha) + 49 (worse) = 99 students total.\n\n**Realization:**  \nHold on, that would make her the 50th out of 99, satisfying both the best and worst rankings. Hmm, does this add up? It seems straightforward, but let's verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Mathematical Equation**\n\n**Step 2:**  \nSet up an equation to represent the total number of students (let's call it \\( n \\)).\n\n**Initial Equation:**  \nSince Misha is the 50th best, there are 49 students better. Similarly, being the 50th worst means there are 49 students worse.\n\nSo, the total number of students should be:  \n\\[\n49 \\text{ (better)} + 1 \\text{ (Misha)} + 49 \\text{ (worse)} = n\n\\]  \n\\[\nn = 99\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis aligns with the earlier calculation. But does this really satisfy both conditions of being the 50th best and worst?\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, if there are 99 students, Misha being the 50th would mean there are 49 on either side. But that also means there's no one else at her level\u2014no ties. Is that possible?\n\n**Check:**  \nYes, it seems to work. There are no ties, and both conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Conclusion of Strategy 2:**  \n<ANSWER>99 students total</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 3: Considering Ties**\n\n**Step 3:**  \nWhat if there are ties in rankings? Would that affect the total number?\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf multiple students share the same rank, it could change the total count. But the problem doesn't mention any ties, so it's safer to assume there are none unless stated.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSince no ties are mentioned, and our previous calculation works without them, I think it's correct to conclude there are 99 students.\n\n**Final Check:**  \n49 students better + Misha + 49 students worse = 99  \nBoth conditions of being the 50th best and worst are satisfied without needing ties.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>99 students total</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, starting with visualization, and verifying with a mathematical equation, I've concluded that there are **99 students** in Misha's grade. Reflecting and checking at each step helped ensure the accuracy of the solution.\n\nIt was essential to consider whether ties existed, but since the problem didn't mention any, assuming no ties led us to the correct answer. Always good to double-check assumptions like that!\n\nI hope this step-by-step approach clarifies how to tackle such problems\u2014thinking like a human, reflecting often, and validating each step along the way.\n\n---",
  "ground_truth": "There are 49 students better than Misha and 49 students worse than Misha. There are $49+49+1=\\boxed{99}$ students in Misha's grade."
