  "problem": "The Little Twelve Basketball Conference has two divisions, with six teams in each division. Each team plays each of the other teams in its own division twice and every team in the other division once. How many conference games are scheduled?",
  "solution": "To determine the total number of conference games scheduled in the Little Twelve Basketball Conference, we will analyze intra-division and inter-division games separately.\n\n**Step 1: Intra-division games.**\n\nEach division consists of 6 teams, and every team plays every other team in its division twice. \n\n1. The number of ways to choose 2 teams from 6 is calculated using the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15 \\text{ matchups.}\n   \\]\n   \n2. Since each matchup occurs twice, the total intra-division games per division is:\n   \\[\n   15 \\times 2 = 30 \\text{ games.}\n   \\]\n   \n3. With 2 divisions, the total intra-division games for the conference is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\times 2 = 60 \\text{ games.}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 2: Inter-division games.**\n\nEach team in one division plays each team in the other division once. \n\n1. Since there are 6 teams in each division, the total number of inter-division games is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 6 = 36 \\text{ games.}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 3: Total games.**\n\nNow, we combine the intra-division and inter-division games to obtain the overall total:\n\\[\n\\text{Total games} = \\text{Total intra-division games} + \\text{Total inter-division games} = 60 + 36 = 96.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of conference games scheduled is:\n\n<ANSWER>96</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Each team plays 10 games in its own division and 6 games against teams in the other division. So each of the 12 teams plays 16 conference games. Because each game involves two teams, there are $\\frac{12\\times 16}{2}=\\boxed{96}$ games scheduled."
