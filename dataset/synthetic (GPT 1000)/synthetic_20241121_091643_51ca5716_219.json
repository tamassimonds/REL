  "problem": "The number 236! ends in how many zeros when expressed as an integer?",
  "solution": "To find out how many trailing zeros are in \\( 236! \\), we need to determine the highest power of 10 that divides \\( 236! \\). Since \\( 10 \\) is composed of the factors \\( 2 \\) and \\( 5 \\), we will focus on counting how many times \\( 5 \\) appears as a factor in \\( 236! \\). This is because there will always be more factors of \\( 2 \\) than factors of \\( 5 \\) in factorials.\n\n### Calculation Steps\n\n1. **Formula for counting prime factors**: The number of times a prime \\( p \\) divides \\( n! \\) can be found using:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^k} \\right\\rfloor\n   \\]\n   Here, we set \\( n = 236 \\) and \\( p = 5 \\).\n\n2. **Counting contributions from \\( 5 \\)**:\n   - For \\( k=1 \\) (i.e., \\( 5^1 = 5 \\)):\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{236}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 47\n     \\]\n   - For \\( k=2 \\) (i.e., \\( 5^2 = 25 \\)):\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{236}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 9\n     \\]\n   - For \\( k=3 \\) (i.e., \\( 5^3 = 125 \\)):\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{236}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n     \\]\n   - For \\( k=4 \\) (i.e., \\( 5^4 = 625 \\)):\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{236}{625} \\right\\rfloor = 0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Adding the contributions**: Now we add these contributions together:\n   \\[\n   47 + 9 + 1 + 0 = 57\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe total count of factors of \\( 5 \\) gives us the number of trailing zeros in \\( 236! \\). Therefore, \\( 236! \\) ends with:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{57} \\text{ trailing zeros.}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "To find the number of terminal zeros, we must find the number of products $2\\times5$ in $236!$. Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, we can get our answer by finding the largest power of 5 that divides $236!$.  Every multiple of 5 less than 236 gives a factor of 5, each multiple of 25 gives an additional factor of 5, and each multiple of 125 gives a third factor of 5.  Therefore, the number of factors of 5 in $236!$ is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{5}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{25}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{125}\\right\\rfloor = 47+9+1=57$. The highest power of 5 that divides $236!$ is $5^{57}$ so $236!$ ends in $\\boxed{57}$ zeros."
