  "problem": "What is the largest four-digit negative integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}?$",
  "solution": "To find the largest four-digit negative integer that is congruent to \\(1 \\mod{23}\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the range**: Four-digit negative integers range from \\(-1000\\) to \\(-9999\\).\n\n2. **Set up the congruence**: We want to find an integer \\(x\\) such that:\n   \\[\n   x \\equiv 1 \\mod{23}\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   x = 23k + 1\n   \\]\n   for some integer \\(k\\).\n\n3. **Find the maximum \\(x\\)**: We need \\(x\\) to be as large as possible, while still being less than or equal to \\(-1000\\). This leads to the inequality:\n   \\[\n   23k + 1 \\leq -1000\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   23k \\leq -1001\n   \\]\n   Dividing by \\(23\\), we derive:\n   \\[\n   k \\leq \\frac{-1001}{23}\n   \\]\n   Performing the division:\n   \\[\n   -1001 \\div 23 \\approx -43.52174\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the largest integer \\(k\\) satisfying this inequality is \\(k = -44\\).\n\n4. **Calculate \\(x\\)**: Substituting \\(k = -44\\) into the expression for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = 23(-44) + 1 = -1012 + 1 = -1011.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verification**: We check if \\(-1011\\) satisfies the congruence:\n   \\[\n   -1011 \\div 23 = -44 \\quad \\text{(which means the quotient is } -44\\text{)}\n   \\]\n   Now, calculating the corresponding remainder:\n   \\[\n   -1011 - (-44 \\times 23) = -1011 + 1012 = 1.\n   \\]\n   Hence, \\(-1011 \\equiv 1 \\mod{23}\\).\n\nIn conclusion, the largest four-digit negative integer that is congruent to \\(1 \\mod{23}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-1011}\n\\] \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>-1011 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "An integer that is congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$ is of the form $23n+1$.\n\nTherefore, we form the inequality $23n+1<-999$, and find the largest possible integer $n$. We get \\begin{align*}\n23n+1&<-999 \\\\\n23n&<-1000\\\\\nn&<-\\frac{1000}{23} \\approx -43.48.\n\\end{align*} The largest possible negative integer $n$ is $-44$. We plug it in for $n$ to get $23 \\cdot -44 +1 =\\boxed{-1011}$."
