  "problem": "What is the range of the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$?",
  "solution": "To determine the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\), we will analyze its behavior across its domain.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Domain\nThe function is defined for all real numbers except \\( x = 0 \\) (due to division by zero). Thus, the domain is:\n\\[\nx \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Function's Behavior\n#### Case 1: \\( x > 0 \\)\nFor positive values of \\( x \\):\n- As \\( x \\) increases (e.g., \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\)), the values of \\( f(x) \\) decrease.\n- At \\( x = 1 \\), \\( f(1) = 1 \\).\n- As \\( x \\) grows larger, \\( f(x) \\) approaches \\( 0 \\) but never reaches it. Consequently, for \\( x > 0 \\), \\( f(x) \\) yields values in the interval \\( (0, 1] \\).\n\n#### Case 2: \\( x < 0 \\)\nFor negative values of \\( x \\):\n- The analysis mirrors that of the positive case since \\( x^2 \\) remains positive.\n- At \\( x = -1 \\), \\( f(-1) = 1 \\).\n- As \\( x \\) becomes more negative, \\( f(x) \\) also approaches \\( 0 \\) but does not reach it. Therefore, for \\( x < 0 \\), \\( f(x) \\) similarly takes values in the interval \\( (0, 1] \\).\n\n### Step 3: Combine Observations\nFrom both analyses, we can conclude that \\( f(x) \\) produces output values that lie in the range \\( (0, 1] \\) for both positive and negative \\( x \\).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusively State the Range\nHowever, the function can yield any positive value, since for any positive \\( a \\), we can find a corresponding \\( x \\) value such that \\( f(x) = a \\) by solving \\( x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}} \\). This demonstrates that the function can achieve every positive number.\n\nThus, the correct final range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(0, \\infty)}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Note that $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} >0$ for all nonzero $x$. That is, the range of $f$ must only include positive numbers. Conversely, if $a$ is a positive number, then \\[f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\right)=\\frac{1}{(1/\\sqrt{a})^2} = a,\\]so $a$ is indeed in the range of $f$. Thus, the range of $f$ is the set of all positive real numbers; in interval notation, that's $\\boxed{(0,\\infty)}$."
