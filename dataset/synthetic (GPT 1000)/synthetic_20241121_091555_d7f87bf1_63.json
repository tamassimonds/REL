  "problem": "Compute the product of $0.\\overline{123}$ and $9$, and write your result as a fraction in simplified form.",
  "solution": "To compute the product of \\(0.\\overline{123}\\) and \\(9\\), we begin by converting \\(0.\\overline{123}\\) into a fraction.\n\n**Step 1: Conversion of \\(0.\\overline{123}\\) to a Fraction**\n\nLet \\(x = 0.\\overline{123}\\). This represents the repeating decimal:\n\\[\nx = 0.123123123\\ldots\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the repeating part, we multiply \\(x\\) by \\(1000\\) (because the repeating segment has 3 digits):\n\\[\n1000x = 123.123123123\\ldots\n\\]\n\nThis allows us to set up the equation:\n\\[\n1000x = 123 + x\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Solving the Equation**\n\nSubtract \\(x\\) from both sides:\n\\[\n999x = 123\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\(999\\) gives:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{123}{999}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplification of \\(\\frac{123}{999}\\)**\n\nNext, we simplify \\(\\frac{123}{999}\\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\(123\\) and \\(999\\).\n- \\(123\\) factors as \\(3 \\times 41\\).\n- \\(999\\) factors as \\(3^3 \\times 37\\).\n\nThe GCD is \\(3\\). So we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \\(3\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{123 \\div 3}{999 \\div 3} = \\frac{41}{333}\n\\]\n\nThus, we conclude:\n\\[\n0.\\overline{123} = \\frac{41}{333}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Multiplying by \\(9\\)**\n\nNow, we calculate:\n\\[\n9 \\times 0.\\overline{123} = 9 \\times \\frac{41}{333} = \\frac{369}{333}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Simplification of \\(\\frac{369}{333}\\)**\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{369}{333}\\), we find the GCD of \\(369\\) and \\(333\\).\n- \\(369\\) factors as \\(3^2 \\times 41\\).\n- \\(333\\) factors as \\(3^2 \\times 37\\).\n\nThe GCD is \\(9\\). Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by \\(9\\) results in:\n\\[\n\\frac{369 \\div 9}{333 \\div 9} = \\frac{41}{37}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nTherefore, the product of \\(0.\\overline{123}\\) and \\(9\\) in its simplest form is:\n\\(\\frac{41}{37}\\).",
  "ground_truth": "If we define the variable $s$ to be $0.\\overline{123}$, then multiplying both sides of $s=0.\\overline{123}$ by 1000 gives us $$1000s = 123.\\overline{123}.$$ Subtracting $s$ from $1000s$ and $0.\\overline{123}$ from $123.\\overline{123}$ tells us that $$999s = 123$$ and thus $$s=\\frac{123}{999}.$$ We can now calculate that our final answer is   $$\\frac{123}{999} \\cdot 9 = \\frac{123}{999 \\div 9} = \\frac{123 \\div 3}{111 \\div 3}=\\boxed{\\frac{41}{37}}.$$"
