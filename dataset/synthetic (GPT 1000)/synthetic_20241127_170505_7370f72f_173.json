  "problem": "The number 236! ends in how many zeros when expressed as an integer?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's refine this into a coherent and polished solution while maintaining the original thought process and final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Complete Solution: Determining the Number of Trailing Zeros in \\(236!\\)**\n\n---\n\n#### **Introduction**\n\nWhen dealing with large factorials like \\(236!\\), a common question is determining how many zeros appear at the end of its integer representation. Trailing zeros are essential in understanding the divisibility properties of numbers and have practical applications in computer science and mathematics.\n\n#### **Brainstorming and Exploring Initial Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this.\n\n- **First Thoughts:**  \n  - Hmm, I remember dealing with factorials and trailing zeros before.\n  - Trailing zeros usually come from factors of 10 in the number.\n  - Each 10 is made up of a 2 and a 5, so I need to find how many pairs of these exist in the factorial.\n  - But wait, aren't there always more 2s than 5s in factorials? So, the limiting factor is the number of 5s.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:**  \n  1. **Count the Factors of 5:**  \n     - This seems familiar. I need to count how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 236.\n     - But is it just the multiples of 5, or do higher powers of 5 matter too?\n\n  2. **Consider Higher Powers of 5:**  \n     - Oh! I remember now. It's not just the multiples of 5 but also multiples of 25, 125, etc., because each contributes extra factors of 5.\n\n- **Deciding on a Strategy:**  \n  - I\u2019ll go with counting all the factors of 5, including higher powers, to ensure I don't miss any.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 1: Counting Multiples of 5**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Let's start by finding how many numbers between 1 and 236 are divisible by 5.\n- Each of these contributes at least one factor of 5.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{236}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 47.2 \\right\\rfloor = 47\n\\]  \n\n- **Interpretation:**  \n  - There are 47 multiples of 5 within 236.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Is that all? Wait, what about numbers like 25 or 125 that have more than one 5 in their prime factorization?\n- I need to account for those too.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Counting Multiples of Higher Powers of 5**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Next, I should count the multiples of \\(5^2 = 25\\) because each of these contributes an extra factor of 5.\n- Then, check for \\(5^3 = 125\\).\n\n**Calculation for Multiples of 25:**  \n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{236}{25} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 9.44 \\right\\rfloor = 9\n\\]  \n\n- **Interpretation:**  \n  - There are 9 multiples of 25, each contributing an additional factor of 5.\n\n**Calculation for Multiples of 125:**  \n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{236}{125} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 1.888 \\right\\rfloor = 1\n\\]  \n\n- **Interpretation:**  \n  - Only 1 multiple of 125 contributes yet another factor of 5.\n\n**Checking for Higher Powers:**  \n- \\(5^4 = 625\\) is greater than 236, so no need to consider higher powers.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Does this cover all the factors of 5?\n- Yes, by considering multiples of 5, 25, and 125, we've accounted for all necessary factors of 5.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Summing Up the Factors of 5**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- I need to add up all the factors of 5 from the multiples counted.\n- Each multiple of 5 contributes one factor, multiples of 25 contribute an additional factor, and multiples of 125 contribute yet another.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\n\\text{Total factors of 5} = 47\\ (\\text{from } 5) + 9\\ (\\text{from } 25) + 1\\ (\\text{from } 125) = 57\n\\]  \n\n- **Interpretation:**  \n  - The total number of factors of 5 is 57, which determines the number of trailing zeros in \\(236!\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Does this make sense?\n- Yes, adding up all contributions from different powers of 5 gives me 57.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Before finalizing, let me quickly verify if I missed anything.\n- Did I consider all relevant powers of 5?\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- 47 multiples of 5 contribute 47 factors.\n- Among these, 9 are also multiples of 25, adding 9 more factors.\n- Plus, 1 multiple of 125 adds another factor.\n- Total: 47 + 9 + 1 = 57.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Everything adds up correctly.\n- I feel confident that the approach is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution </ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hence, } 236! \\text{ ends with } \\boxed{57} \\text{ zeros.}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n#### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n- **By breaking down the problem into counting multiples of different powers of 5, I ensured that all factors contributing to trailing zeros were accounted for.**\n- **Reflecting at each step helped catch any potential oversights, confirming the correctness of the solution.**\n- **The final answer aligns with the initial working out, validating the approach and calculations.**\n\n---\n\nThis structured approach not only verifies the correctness of the solution but also enhances understanding by meticulously tracking each step and reflection.",
  "ground_truth": "To find the number of terminal zeros, we must find the number of products $2\\times5$ in $236!$. Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, we can get our answer by finding the largest power of 5 that divides $236!$.  Every multiple of 5 less than 236 gives a factor of 5, each multiple of 25 gives an additional factor of 5, and each multiple of 125 gives a third factor of 5.  Therefore, the number of factors of 5 in $236!$ is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{5}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{25}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{125}\\right\\rfloor = 47+9+1=57$. The highest power of 5 that divides $236!$ is $5^{57}$ so $236!$ ends in $\\boxed{57}$ zeros."
