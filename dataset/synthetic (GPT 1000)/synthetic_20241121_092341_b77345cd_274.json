  "problem": "For all composite integers $n$, what is the largest integer that always divides into the difference between $n$ and the cube of $n$?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of finding the largest integer that divides the difference between a composite integer \\( n \\) and its cube \\( n^3 \\), we start by expressing this difference mathematically:\n\n\\[\nd(n) = n^3 - n\n\\]\n\nNext, we factor this expression:\n\n\\[\nd(n) = n(n^2 - 1) = n(n-1)(n+1)\n\\]\n\nThis means that \\( d(n) \\) is the product of \\( n \\), \\( n-1 \\), and \\( n+1 \\), which are three consecutive integers.\n\n### Step 1: Evenness\n\nSince \\( n \\) is a composite integer (and greater than 1), one of the three consecutive integers \\( n \\), \\( n-1 \\), or \\( n+1 \\) must be even. Therefore, \\( d(n) \\) is always divisible by 2.\n\n### Step 2: Divisibility by 3\n\nSimilarly, among any three consecutive integers, at least one must also be divisible by 3. Thus, \\( d(n) = n(n-1)(n+1) \\) is also divisible by 3.\n\n### Step 3: Least Common Multiple\n\nSince \\( d(n) \\) is divisible by both 2 and 3, we can conclude that it is divisible by their least common multiple:\n\n\\[\n\\text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Checking for Higher Divisors\n\nTo determine if there is an integer greater than 6 that consistently divides \\( d(n) \\) for all composite integers \\( n \\), we can test specific composite values.\n\n- For \\( n = 4 \\):\n  \\[\n  d(4) = 4(4^2 - 1) = 4(16 - 1) = 4 \\times 15 = 60\n  \\]\n- For \\( n = 6 \\):\n  \\[\n  d(6) = 6(6^2 - 1) = 6(36 - 1) = 6 \\times 35 = 210\n  \\]\nBoth 60 and 210 are divisible by 6.\n\nNext, we test additional values:\n\n- For \\( n = 8 \\):\n  \\[\n  d(8) = 8(8^2 - 1) = 8(64 - 1) = 8 \\times 63 = 504\n  \\]\n- For \\( n = 9 \\):\n  \\[\n  d(9) = 9(9^2 - 1) = 9(81 - 1) = 9 \\times 80 = 720\n  \\]\n\nWhile all these values are divisible by 6, checking their divisibility by higher numbers, such as 12 or 18, reveals inconsistencies. For example, the values obtained for these examples do not all yield consistent divisibility by numbers greater than 6.\n\n### Conclusion \n\nAfter analyzing various composite integers, we find that \\( d(n) \\) is consistently divisible by 6 across all tested cases. Thus, we conclude that the largest integer that always divides the expression \\( n^3 - n \\) for all composite integers \\( n \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Notice that $n^3 - n$ factors as $n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = (n-1)n(n+1)$. We observe that among any three consecutive integers, at least one must be divisible by $2$ and one must be divisible by $3$. Thus, we know that $6$ must always divide into $n^3 - n$. Indeed, this is the largest such integer; for $n = 6$, then $n^3 - n = 210 = 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, and for $n = 33$, then $n^3 - n = 32 \\cdot 33 \\cdot 34 = 6 \\cdot 32 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 17$, whose greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{6}$."
