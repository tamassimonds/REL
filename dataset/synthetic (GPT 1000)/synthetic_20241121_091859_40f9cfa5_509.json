  "solution": "Here's a clearer summary of the solution to find the common tangent line to the parabolas \\( P_{1}: y = x^{2} + \\frac{101}{100} \\) and \\( P_{2}: x = y^{2} + \\frac{45}{4} \\) with a rational slope:\n\n### Summary of the Solution\n\n1. **Tangent Line to \\( P_1 \\)**:\n   - For the parabola \\( P_{1} \\), the slope of the tangent at point \\( (x_0, x_0^2 + \\frac{101}{100}) \\) is \\( m = 2x_0 \\). \n   - The equation of the tangent line can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     y = 2x_0 x - 2x_0^2 + \\frac{101}{100}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tangent Line to \\( P_2 \\)**:\n   - For the parabola \\( P_{2} \\), the slope of the tangent at point \\( (y_1^2 + \\frac{45}{4}, y_1) \\) is \\( m' = 2y_1 \\).\n   - The equation of the tangent line is:\n     \\[\n     x = 2y_1 y - y_1^2 + \\frac{45}{4}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Equating the Two Tangent Lines**:\n   - For the tangent lines to be the same, set the equations equal:\n     \\[\n     2x_0 x - 2x_0^2 + \\frac{101}{100} = 2y_1 y - y_1^2 + \\frac{45}{4}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conditions for Rational Slopes**:\n   - To ensure a rational slope, let \\( x_0 = \\frac{p}{2q} \\) and \\( y_1 = \\frac{q}{4p} \\) where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are integers.\n\n5. **Tangency Conditions**:\n   - For the tangents, derive quadratic equations and use the discriminant condition:\n     - For \\( P_1 \\):\n       \\[\n       25a^2 - 101b^2 + 100bc = 0.\n       \\]\n     - For \\( P_2 \\):\n       \\[\n       4b^2 - 180a + 16ac = 0.\n       \\]\n\n6. **Finding Integer Solutions**:\n   - Set \\( b = 5a \\) and substitute into the equations to find integer values for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n7. **Calculating Values**:\n   - By trial, let \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 5 \\), and \\( c = 5 \\).

  "ground_truth": "From the condition that $\\mathcal L$ is tangent to $P_1$ we have that the system of equations $ax + by = c$ and ${y = x^2 + \\frac{101}{100}}$ has exactly one solution, so $ax + b(x^2 + \\frac{101}{100}) = c$ has exactly one solution. A quadratic equation with only one solution must have discriminant equal to zero, so we must have $a^2 - 4\\cdot b \\cdot (\\frac{101}{100}b - c) = 0$ or equivalently $25a^2 -101b^2 + 100bc = 0$. Applying the same process to $P_2$, we have that $a(y^2 + \\frac{45}4) + by = c$ has a unique root so $b^2 - 4\\cdot a \\cdot (\\frac{45}4a - c) = 0$ or equivalently $b^2 - 45a^2 + 4ac = 0$. We multiply the first of these equations through by $a$ and the second through by $25b$ and subtract in order to eliminate $c$ and get $25a^3 + 1125 a^2b - 101ab^2 - 25b^3 = 0$. We know that the slope of $\\mathcal L$, $-\\frac b a$, is a rational number, so we divide this equation through by $-a^3$ and let $\\frac b a = q$ to get $25q^3 +101q^2 - 1125q - 25 = 0$. Since we're searching for a rational root, we can use the Rational Root Theorem to search all possibilities and find that $q = 5$ is a solution. (The other two roots are the roots of the quadratic equation $25q^2 + 226q +5 = 0$, both of which are irrational.) Thus $b = 5a$. Now we go back to one of our first equations, say $b^2 - 45a^2 + 4ac = 0$, to get $25a^2 - 45a^2 + 4ac = 0 \\Longrightarrow c = 5a$. (We can reject the alternate possibility $a = 0$ because that would give $a = b = 0$ and our \"line\" would not exist.) Then $a : b : c = 1 : 5 : 5$ and since the greatest common divisor of the three numbers is 1, $a = 1, b = 5, c = 5$ and $a + b + c = \\boxed{11}$."
