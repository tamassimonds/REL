  "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is equal to a terminating decimal?",
  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's craft a polished, coherent solution by integrating the brainstorming, reflections, and step-by-step strategies from the working draft. We'll maintain the original thought process but present it in a more structured and concise manner, ensuring clarity while retaining the authentic problem-solving journey.\n\n---\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\(\\frac{n}{n+101}\\) is a terminating decimal. Let's explore different strategies, reflect on each step, and verify our final answer to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\n- **First Reaction:** This problem reminds me of how fractions convert to decimals. Specifically, I recall that a decimal is terminating if its denominator, after simplification, has only the prime factors 2 and 5.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Factor the Denominator:** Ensure that \\( n+101 \\) is composed only of the prime factors 2 and 5.\n  2. **Simplify the Fraction:** Attempt to reduce \\(\\frac{n}{n+101}\\) and see if the denominator simplifies accordingly.\n  3. **Consider Decimal Expansions:** Reflect on the properties of terminating decimals to inform our approach.\n\nSince multiple strategies point towards examining the factors of the denominator, let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Strategy 1 - Factoring the Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:** A fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) has a terminating decimal if, after simplification, the denominator \\( q \\) contains only the prime factors 2 and 5. Therefore, we need \\( n+101 \\) to be a multiple of 2 and/or 5.\n\n**Action:** Let's express \\( n+101 \\) as:\n\n\\[\nn+101 = 2^a \\times 5^b\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are non-negative integers. Our goal is to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that this equation holds and \\( n \\) is positive.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for the Smallest \\( n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:** We need to find the smallest powers of 2 and 5 such that \\( n = 2^a \\times 5^b - 101 \\) results in a positive integer.\n\n**Attempting Different Cases:**\n\n- **Case 1:** \\( a = 0, b = 0 \\)\n  \\[\n  n + 101 = 1 \\implies n = 1 - 101 = -100 \\quad (\\text{Negative, not valid})\n  \\]\n\n- **Case 2:** \\( a = 1, b = 0 \\)\n  \\[\n  n + 101 = 2 \\implies n = 2 - 101 = -99 \\quad (\\text{Negative})\n  \\]\n\n- **Case 3:** \\( a = 0, b = 1 \\)\n  \\[\n  n + 101 = 5 \\implies n = 5 - 101 = -96 \\quad (\\text{Negative})\n  \\]\n\n- **Case 4:** \\( a = 1, b = 1 \\)\n  \\[\n  n + 101 = 10 \\implies n = 10 - 101 = -91 \\quad (\\text{Negative})\n  \\]\n\n- **Continuing in this manner\u2026**\n\n**Realization:** All initial cases yield negative \\( n \\). We need to increase the exponents until \\( n \\) becomes positive.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying the Smallest Positive \\( n \\)**\n\n**Continuing with Higher Powers:**\n\n- **Case 10:** \\( a = 0, b = 3 \\)\n  \\[\n  n + 101 = 5^3 = 125 \\implies n = 125 - 101 = 24 \\quad (\\text{Positive!})\n  \\]\n\n**Conclusion from Strategy 1:** The smallest positive integer \\( n \\) is \\( n = 24 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:** Before finalizing, let's verify whether \\(\\frac{24}{125}\\) is indeed a terminating decimal.\n\n- **Action:** Simplify the fraction:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{24}{125} = \\frac{24}{5^3}\n  \\]\n  \n  Since the denominator is a power of 5 (no other prime factors), the decimal representation should be terminating.\n\n- **Decimal Conversion:** \n  \\[\n  \\frac{24}{125} = 0.192\n  \\]\n  \n  **Reflection:** This is indeed a terminating decimal, confirming that our solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:** To ensure robustness, let's briefly consider other strategies.\n\n- **Strategy 2: Simplify the Fraction**\n  - Attempting to simplify \\(\\frac{n}{n+101}\\) doesn't directly provide new insights since \\( n \\) and \\( n+101 \\) are coprime unless \\( n \\) shares factors with 101. Given that 101 is prime, this approach isn't particularly helpful.\n\n- **Strategy 3: Consider Decimal Expansions**\n  - Recalling that only denominators with prime factors 2 and 5 yield terminating decimals reinforces our initial strategy.\n\n**Conclusion:** Alternative strategies align with and support Strategy 1, validating our approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Brainstorming Multiple Strategies:** Initially considered factoring the denominator, simplifying the fraction, and examining decimal properties.\n- **Continuous Reflection:** Checked each step to ensure progress towards a valid solution.\n- **Verification:** Confirmed the correctness by converting the fraction to a decimal.\n- **Exploring Alternatives:** Alternative strategies reinforced the primary approach, adding confidence to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER>The smallest positive integer \\( n \\) is \\( n = 24 \\).</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, continuously reflecting on each step, and verifying the final answer, we've confidently determined that the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) is 24. This thorough approach ensures the solution's accuracy and robustness, mimicking an authentic problem-solving process.",
  "ground_truth": "If $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is a terminating decimal, then $n+101$ is divisible only by 2 and 5. We proceed by looking for integers only divisible by 2 and 5.\n\nWe find that 125 is the smallest power of 5 greater than 101. The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 25 is also 125; multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 100, then 200. The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 5 is also 125, since multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 80, then 160. Finally, the smallest power of 2 greater than 101 is 128. 125 is the smallest denominator that will give a terminating decimal, so we have that $n+101 = 125$ which implies $n = \\boxed{24}$."
