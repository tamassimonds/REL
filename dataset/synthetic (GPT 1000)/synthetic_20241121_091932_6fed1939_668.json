  "problem": "How many integers $n$ satisfy the inequality $-8\\pi\\le n\\le10\\pi$?",
  "solution": "To solve the inequality \\( -8\\pi \\le n \\le 10\\pi \\), we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Approximate the bounds:**\n   - Calculate \\( -8\\pi \\):\n     \\[\n     -8\\pi \\approx -8 \\times 3.14 = -25.12\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 10\\pi \\):\n     \\[\n     10\\pi \\approx 10 \\times 3.14 = 31.4\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the range of integers:**\n   The inequality implies \\( n \\) can take integer values from approximately \\( -25.12 \\) to \\( 31.4 \\). Thus, the relevant range for integers is:\n   \\[\n   -25 \\text{ to } 31\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( -25 \\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\( -25.12 \\) and \\( 31 \\) is the largest integer less than or equal to \\( 31.4 \\).\n\n3. **Count the integers in this range:**\n   The total number of integers from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) (inclusive) can be calculated using:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of integers} = b - a + 1\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( a = -25 \\) and \\( b = 31 \\):\n   \\[\n   31 - (-25) + 1 = 31 + 25 + 1 = 57\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the inequality \\( -8\\pi \\le n \\le 10\\pi \\) is \\( 57 \\).\n\nIn summary:\n\\[\n\\text{<ANSWER> 57 </ANSWER>}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The number $\\pi$ is between $3.14$ and $3.15$, so $-8\\pi$ is between $-8(3.15) = 25.2$ and $-8(3.14) = 25.12$. Likewise, $10\\pi$ is between $31.4$ and $31.5$. This suffices to establish that the integers $n$ between $-8\\pi$ and $10\\pi$ are precisely $$-25, -24, -23, -22, \\ldots, 28, 29, 30, 31.$$ There are $25$ negative integers in this list, $31$ positive integers, and one more integer ($0$), making $\\boxed{57}$ integers in total."
