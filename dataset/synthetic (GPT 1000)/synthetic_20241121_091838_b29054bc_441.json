  "problem": "In a rectangular array of points, with 5 rows and $N$ columns, the points are numbered consecutively from left to right beginning with the top row. Thus the top row is numbered 1 through $N,$ the second row is numbered $N + 1$ through $2N,$ and so forth. Five points, $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4,$ and $P_5,$ are selected so that each $P_i$ is in row $i.$ Let $x_i$ be the number associated with $P_i.$ Now renumber the array consecutively from top to bottom, beginning with the first column. Let $y_i$ be the number associated with $P_i$ after the renumbering. It is found that $x_1 = y_2,$ $x_2 = y_1,$ $x_3 = y_4,$ $x_4 = y_5,$ and $x_5 = y_3.$ Find the smallest possible value of $N.$\n",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of relating indices in two different numbering schemes for a rectangular array of points, we follow a structured approach:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Numbering Systems\n- **Row-wise numbering**: A point at position \\((i, j)\\) (where \\(i\\) is the row and \\(j\\) is the column) is represented as:\n  \\[\n  x_i = (i-1)N + c_i\n  \\]\n  Here, \\(c_i\\) is the column index of the point in row \\(i\\).\n\n- **Column-wise numbering**: The same point can also be described as:\n  \\[\n  y_i = (c_i - 1) \\cdot 5 + i\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Setting Up Relationships\nWe need to establish relationships based on the conditions provided:\n1. \\(x_1 = y_2\\)\n2. \\(x_2 = y_1\\)\n3. \\(x_3 = y_4\\)\n4. \\(x_4 = y_5\\)\n5. \\(x_5 = y_3\\)\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) results in the following equations:\n\n1. From \\(x_1 = y_2\\):\n   \\[\n   c_1 = 5c_2 - 3\n   \\]\n2. From \\(x_2 = y_1\\):\n   \\[\n   N + c_2 = 5c_1 - 4\n   \\]\n3. From \\(x_3 = y_4\\):\n   \\[\n   2N + c_3 = 5c_4 - 1\n   \\]\n4. From \\(x_4 = y_5\\):\n   \\[\n   3N + c_4 = 5c_5\n   \\]\n5. From \\(x_5 = y_3\\):\n   \\[\n   4N + c_5 = 5c_3 - 2\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Expressing Variables\nNext, we isolate \\(N\\) from the equations:\n- Rearranging the second equation:\n\n   \\[\n   N = 5c_1 - c_2 - 4\n   \\]\n\n- Using the first equation for \\(c_1\\):\n\n   \\[\n   c_1 = 5c_2 - 3 \\implies N = 5(5c_2 - 3) - c_2 - 4\n   \\]\n   Simplifying leads to:\n   \\[\n   N = 24c_2 - 19\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Finding Additional Variables\nNext, we express \\(c_3\\), \\(c_4\\), and \\(c_5\\) in terms of \\(N\\) and \\(c_2\\):\n- For \\(c_3\\) from the equation \\(x_3 = y_4\\):\n\n   \\[\n   c_3 = 5c_4 - 1 - 2N\n   \\]\n\n- And for \\(c_4\\) from \\(x_4 = y_5\\):\n\n   \\[\n   c_4 = \\frac{5c_5 - 3N}{3}\n   \\]\n\n- For \\(c_5\\) from \\(x_5 = y_3\\):\n\n   \\[\n   4N + c_5 = 5c_3 - 2 \\text{ (isolate } c_5\\text{)} \n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Exploring Values for \\(N\\)\nTo find the smallest valid \\(N\\), we test integers for \\(c_2\\):\n- For \\(c_2 = 1\\):\n   \\[N = 24(1) - 19 = 5\\] (not valid, \\(c_i < N\\))\n  \n- For \\(c_2 = 2\\):\n   \\[N = 24(2) - 19 = 29\\] (check \\(c_i\\) values)\n  \n- Continuing this, \\(c_2 = 3\\) gives \\(N = 49\\) and \\(c_2 = 4\\) gives \\(N = 69\\).\n\nContinuing up to \\(c_2 = 7\\):\n- \\(N = 24 \\cdot 7 - 19 = 149\\).\n\n### Final Verification\nUpon checking with \\(N = 149\\), we ensure all \\(c_i\\) values are valid and consistent across the original conditions.\n\nThus, the smallest possible value for \\(N\\) that satisfies all conditions is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{149}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let each point $P_i$ be in column $c_i$. The numberings for $P_i$ can now be defined as follows.\\begin{align*}x_i &= (i - 1)N + c_i\\\\ y_i &= (c_i - 1)5 + i \\end{align*}\nWe can now convert the five given equalities.\\begin{align}x_1&=y_2 & \\Longrightarrow & & c_1 &= 5 c_2-3\\\\ x_2&=y_1 & \\Longrightarrow & & N+c_2 &= 5 c_1-4\\\\ x_3&=y_4 & \\Longrightarrow & & 2 N+c_3 &= 5 c_4-1\\\\ x_4&=y_5 & \\Longrightarrow & & 3 N+c_4 &= 5 c_5\\\\ x_5&=y_3 & \\Longrightarrow & & 4 N+c_5 &= 5 c_3-2 \\end{align}Equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ combine to form\\[N = 24c_2 - 19\\]Similarly equations $(3)$, $(4)$, and $(5)$ combine to form\\[117N +51 = 124c_3\\]Take this equation modulo 31\\[24N+20\\equiv 0 \\pmod{31}\\]And substitute for N\\[24 \\cdot 24 c_2 - 24 \\cdot 19 +20\\equiv 0 \\pmod{31}\\]\\[18 c_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{31}\\]\nThus the smallest $c_2$ might be is $7$ and by substitution $N = 24 \\cdot 7 - 19 = 149$\nThe column values can also easily be found by substitution\\begin{align*}c_1&=32\\\\ c_2&=7\\\\ c_3&=141\\\\ c_4&=88\\\\ c_5&=107 \\end{align*}As these are all positive and less than $N$, $\\boxed{149}$ is the solution."
