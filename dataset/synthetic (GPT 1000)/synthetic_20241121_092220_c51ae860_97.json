  "problem": "Two arithmetic sequences $A$ and $B$ both begin with 30 and have common differences of absolute value 10, with sequence $A$ increasing and sequence $B$ decreasing. What is the absolute value of the difference between the 51st term of sequence $A$ and the 51st term of sequence $B$?",
  "solution": "To determine the absolute value of the difference between the 51st term of sequence \\( A \\) and the 51st term of sequence \\( B \\), we first define the sequences based on their starting points and common differences.\n\n1. **Defining the Sequences**:\n   - **Sequence \\( A \\)**: Starts at 30 and increases by 10 for each subsequent term. The general formula for the \\( n \\)-th term is:\n     \\[\n     A_n = 30 + (n-1) \\cdot 10\n     \\]\n   - **Sequence \\( B \\)**: Starts at 30 and decreases by 10 for each subsequent term. Its general formula is:\n     \\[\n     B_n = 30 - (n-1) \\cdot 10\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the 51st Term**:\n   - For sequence \\( A \\):\n     \\[\n     A_{51} = 30 + (51-1) \\cdot 10 = 30 + 50 \\cdot 10 = 30 + 500 = 530\n     \\]\n   - For sequence \\( B \\):\n     \\[\n     B_{51} = 30 - (51-1) \\cdot 10 = 30 - 50 \\cdot 10 = 30 - 500 = -470\n     \\]\n\n3. **Finding the Absolute Value of the Difference**:\n   We calculate the difference between \\( A_{51} \\) and \\( B_{51} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = A_{51} - B_{51} = 530 - (-470) = 530 + 470 = 1000\n   \\]\n   Thus, the absolute value of this difference is:\n   \\[\n   |A_{51} - B_{51}| = |1000| = 1000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Conclusion**:\nTherefore, the absolute value of the difference between the 51st term of sequence \\( A \\) and the 51st term of sequence \\( B \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1000}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence whose first term is $a_1$ and whose common difference is $d$ is $a_n=a_1+d(n-1)$.  Therefore, the $n$th term of $A$ is $30+10(n-1)$, and the $n$th term of $B$ is $30-10(n-1)$.  Therefore, the positive difference between the $n$th term of $A$ and the $n$th term of $B$ is $30+10(n-1)-[30-10(n-1)]=20(n-1)$.  Substituting $n=51$, we find that the positive difference between the 51st terms of $A$ and $B$ is $\\boxed{1000}$."
