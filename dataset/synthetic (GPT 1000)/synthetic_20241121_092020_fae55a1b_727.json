  "problem": "A four-digit integer $m$ and the four-digit integer obtained by reversing the order of the digits of $m$ are both divisible by 45. If $m$ is divisible by 7, what is the greatest possible value of $m$?",
  "solution": "To find the largest four-digit integer \\( m \\) such that both \\( m \\) and its reverse \\( n \\) are divisible by 45, and \\( m \\) is also divisible by 7, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Conditions for Divisibility by 45\nA number is divisible by 45 if it is divisible by both 5 and 9.\n\n1. **Divisibility by 5**: Since \\( m \\) is a four-digit integer, it must end in 5 (as it cannot end in 0, which would lead to a three-digit number upon reversal).\n  \n2. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of \\( m \\) must be divisible by 9.\n\nLet \\( m \\) be represented as \\( m = d_1d_2d_3d_4 \\), where \\( d_4 = 5 \\). Thus, we express \\( m \\) as:\n\\[\nm = 1000d_1 + 100d_2 + 10d_3 + 5\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Reverse \\( n \\)\nThe reverse \\( n \\) of \\( m \\) is \\( n = 5d_3d_2d_1 \\). Since \\( n \\) also ends with 5, it is trivially divisible by 5. For \\( n \\) to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 9. The sums for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are equivalent:\n\\[\nS_m = d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + 5\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Greatest Four-Digit \\( m \\)\nTo be divisible by both 7 and 45, \\( m \\) must also be divisible by their least common multiple, which is 315. We are tasked with finding the largest four-digit number divisible by 315 that ends in 5.\n\nStarting from the largest four-digit number, 9995, we check downwards for multiples of 315:\n- \\( 9995 \\div 315 \\approx 31.7 \\): not an integer.\n- Continuing this way, we find \\( 9450 \\) (since \\( 9450 \\div 315 = 30 \\)).\n\n### Step 4: Verifying Divisibility by 9 and 7\n1. **Check for divisibility by 9**:\n   Calculate the sum of the digits of \\( 9450 \\):\n   \\[\n   S = 9 + 4 + 5 + 0 = 18\n   \\]\n   \\( 18 \\) is divisible by 9.\n\n2. **Check for divisibility by 7**:\n   \\[\n   9450 \\div 7 = 1350\n   \\]\n   \\( 1350 \\) is an integer; therefore, \\( m \\) is divisible by 7.\n\n### Step 5: Check the Reverse\nNow consider the reverse \\( n = 0549 \\) (which is effectively \\( 549 \\)):\n- **Check if \\( 549 \\) is divisible by 45**:\n  - **Divisibility by 5**: Last digit is \\( 9 \\): not divisible.\n  \nSince \\( 549 \\) fails, we continue checking lower multiples of 315.\n\n### Further Checks\nEventually, we find \\( m = 5985 \\):\n1. **Check \\( m = 5985 \\)**:\n   - Sum of digits: \\( 5 + 9 + 8 + 5 = 27 \\) (divisible by 9).\n   - Dividing by 7: \\( 5985 \\div 7 = 855 \\) (divisible by 7).\n\n2. **Check the reverse \\( n = 5895 \\)**:\n   - Sum: \\( 5 + 8 + 9 + 5 = 27 \\) (divisible by 9).\n   - Last digit \\( 5 \\) (divisible by 5).\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) meet the conditions for divisibility. Therefore, the greatest four-digit integer \\( m \\) such that both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are divisible by 45 and \\( m \\) is divisible by 7 is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{5985}\\)",
  "ground_truth": "Let the integer obtained by reversing the digits of $m$ be $n$. $m$ and $n$ are both divisible by $45$, which means that they are both divisible by $5$.  Thus, they both have units digits of $5$ or $0$.  If one has a units digit of $0$, the other will have a leading digit of $0$, which cannot be.  So both end in $5$; reversing them shows that both start with $5$ as well.  Since $m$ is divisible by $45$ and by $7$, it is divisible by $7(45)=315$.  There are four multiples of $315$ between $5000$ and $6000$: $5040$, $5355$, $5670$, and $5985$. $5985$ is the largest, and it is easy to see that it and its reversal, $5895$, meet all requirements.  So $\\boxed{5985}$ is the answer."
