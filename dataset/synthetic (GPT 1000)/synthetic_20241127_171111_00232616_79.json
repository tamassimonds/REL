  "problem": "If I roll 5 standard 6-sided dice and multiply the number on the face of each die, what is the probability that the result is a composite number?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into this problem. I want to approach it naturally, acknowledging where I might have gone off track and integrating better strategies as I reflect on my initial thoughts.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n---\n\nOkay, so I need to find the probability that the product of numbers from rolling five 6-sided dice is a composite number. Initially, this reminds me of dice probability problems, but adding the composite condition makes it trickier. Should I start by considering all possible outcomes, or maybe focus on what makes a number composite? Hmm, I'm not sure yet, so let me brainstorm different strategies.\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Total Possible Outcomes**\n\nMy first instinct is to calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Each die has 6 faces, so it's \\(6^5\\). Let me do the math:\n\n\\[\n6^5 = 7,776\n\\]\n\nAlright, there are 7,776 total outcomes. But wait, trying to list each outcome individually seems overwhelming. Maybe I need a more efficient approach. Hmm, perhaps considering complementary probability might help here.\n\n#### **2. Complementary Probability**\n\nThis approach involves finding the probability that the product is **not** composite (i.e., the product is either 1 or a prime number) and then subtracting that from 1. It seems logical because identifying non-composite cases might be easier. But is it really? Let me explore this idea further.\n\n### **Exploring the Complementary Probability Approach**\n\n---\n\nLet me list out the cases where the product is **not** composite. This includes:\n\n1. The product is 1 (all dice show 1).\n2. The product is a prime number.\n\nBut wait, isn't listing all prime products complicated, especially with five dice? Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps focusing on cases where the product is **composite** would be more straightforward.\n\nActually, looking at this again, I realize that if more than one die shows a number greater than 1, the product will likely be composite. Also, if any die shows a 4 or 6, the product will be composite because those numbers have multiple factors. This insight might simplify things.\n\n### **Revisiting the Strategy: Counting Non-Composite Products**\n\n---\n\nAlright, let me adjust my approach. Instead of trying to list all prime products, I'll focus on counting the cases where the product is **not** composite. Specifically, I'll consider scenarios where:\n\n- At least four dice show 1.\n- The remaining die shows either 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since these are either 1 or prime numbers).\n\nThis seems more manageable. Let's proceed with this strategy.\n\n### **Calculating the Probability of Non-Composite Products**\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 1: Probability of the Product Being 1**\n\nThis case occurs when all five dice show 1. There's only one such outcome.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{1}{7,776} \\approx 0.0001286\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's a tiny probability, which makes sense because it's rare for all dice to show 1.\n\n#### **Step 2: Probability of the Product Being Prime**\n\nNext, I need to consider cases where the product is a prime number. This happens when exactly one die shows a prime number (2, 3, or 5), and the other four dice show 1. Since there are five dice, each prime number can appear in any of the five positions.\n\n- **Prime 2:** 5 ways\n- **Prime 3:** 5 ways\n- **Prime 5:** 5 ways\n\nTotal prime outcomes = \\(5 + 5 + 5 = 15\\)\n\nSo, there are 15 outcomes where the product is prime.\n\n#### **Step 3: Total Non-Composite Outcomes**\n\nAdding the case where the product is 1, we have:\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ (product = 1)} + 15 \\text{ (prime products)} = 16 \\text{ non-composite outcomes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of the product being **not** composite is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{7,776} \\approx 0.002057\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's a small probability, indicating that non-composite products are rare. This feels right because multiplying five numbers generally results in a composite product.\n\n### **Final Calculation: Probability of Composite Products**\n\n---\n\nNow, to find the probability of the product being composite, I'll subtract the probability of non-composite products from 1:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{16}{7,776} = \\frac{7,760}{7,776} \\approx 0.997943\n\\]\n\nSo, the probability of the product being composite is approximately 99.79%.\n\n**Reflection:** Wait a minute, this probability is nearly 1, which makes sense given that most combinations of five numbers will result in a composite product. It seems like I've arrived at a reasonable answer.\n\n### **Sample Solution Integration**\n\n---\n\nLooking back at my process, I see that I initially hesitated with listing prime products, but by focusing on non-composite cases where at least four dice show 1 and the fifth die shows 1, 2, 3, or 5, I streamlined the solution. Acknowledging that only 16 out of 7,776 outcomes are non-composite simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n---\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the numbers rolled on five 6-sided dice is a composite number is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7,760}{7,776} = \\frac{485}{486} \\approx 0.997943 \\text{ or } 99.79\\%\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:** By rethinking my initial approach and focusing on counting the limited non-composite cases, I efficiently arrived at the correct probability. This complementary probability method made the problem much more manageable.",
  "ground_truth": "While it is almost tempting to make this into the casework problem to end all casework problems, using complementary probability makes the problem a lot simpler, so we will find the probability that the product is not composite.\n\nIt's clear that if more than one die shows a roll greater than 1, the resulting product will have more than one factor that is greater than 1 and therefore be composite. Additionally, if any of the dice show a 4 or a 6, the product will obviously be composite. So in order for the product to not be composite, we need at least four dice to be a 1 and the fifth die to either be another 1 or a 2, a 3, or a 5.\n\nThere's exactly one way in which all the the dice can be 1's, and for each of the other three cases there are 5 ways since the die that isn't a 1 can appear in any of the 5 other positions, so there are a total of $3\\cdot5+1=16$ ways of rolling the dice that result in a product that isn't composite. Additionally, there are 6 options for the roll of each of the 5 dice for a total of $6^5=7776$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of the product not being composite is $\\dfrac{16}{7776}$ and the probability that it is composite is $1-\\frac{16}{7776}=\\frac{7760}{7776}=\\boxed{\\frac{485}{486}}$.\n\nNote: Many students have tried to argue that 1 is not a prime number and should not be counted. As we are doing complementary probability, it is important to consider all numbers that are not composite, and 1 is definitely not composite."
