  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it for the first time. I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, reflect often to check if I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's keep it natural and human-like, embracing the messy thought process that often accompanies problem-solving.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is asking to evaluate \n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^9 + b^9}{(a + b)^9}\n\\]\n\ngiven that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are nonzero complex numbers satisfying \n\n\\[\na^2 + ab + b^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Hmm, this equation  \n\\(a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0\\)  \nlooks familiar. It reminds me of problems involving roots of unity or complex numbers with specific relationships. But I'm not entirely sure yet how it connects to the expression we need to evaluate.\n\n- **Brainstorming Ideas:**\n  - Maybe relate \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to roots of a polynomial.\n  - Consider expressing \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in terms of each other.\n  - Perhaps use identities involving powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not exactly sure which path will lead to the solution, so I'll need to explore a bit and see what works.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Express \\(b\\) in Terms of \\(a\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Let's try to express  \n\\(b\\)  \nin terms of  \n\\(a\\)  \nusing the given equation. Maybe that will simplify things.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n\n\\[\na^2 + ab + b^2 = 0 \\implies b^2 + ab + a^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n- **Attempt to Solve for \\(b\\):**\n  - This is a quadratic in \\(b\\): \n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - 4a^2}}{2} = \\frac{-a \\pm \\sqrt{-3a^2}}{2} = \\frac{-a \\pm \\sqrt{3}ai}{2}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait a minute! This gives us two possible values for  \n\\(b\\),  \nbut dealing with square roots and complex numbers might complicate things further. It doesn't seem like this approach is simplifying the expression we need to evaluate.\n\n- **Decision:** I don't think expressing  \n\\(b\\)  \nin terms of  \n\\(a\\)  \nis the most efficient path. Let's try something else.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Recognize Polynomial Roots**\n\n- **Thought Process:** The equation   \n\\(a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0\\)  \nresembles the condition for roots of certain polynomials. Maybe  \n\\(a\\)  \nand  \n\\(b\\)  \nare roots of a cubic polynomial.\n\n- **Exploring Further:**\n  - If  \n\\(a\\)  \nand  \n\\(b\\)  \nare roots, perhaps  \n\\(a + b\\)  \nand  \n\\(ab\\)  \nhave specific relationships.\n  \n- **But Wait:** Actually, I recall that for the equation  \n\\(a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0\\),  \n\\(a\\)  \nand  \n\\(b\\)  \nare related to the cube roots of unity. Let's dig into that.\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Connect to Cube Roots of Unity**\n\n- **Thought Process:** The equation  \n\\(a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0\\)  \ncan be factored using complex roots. I remember that the cube roots of unity satisfy similar equations.\n\n- **Exploring Further:**\n  - Let's see if  \n\\(a\\)  \nand  \n\\(b\\)  \nare related to the cube roots of unity,  \n\\(\\omega\\)  \nand  \n\\(\\omega^2\\),  \nwhere  \n\\(\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 3}\\).\n\n- **Calculating:**\n  - Recall that  \n\\(\\omega^3 = 1\\)  \nand  \n\\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\).\n  - If we set  \n\\(a = \\omega\\)  \nand  \n\\(b = \\omega^2\\)  \n(or vice versa), the equation holds:\n\n\\[\n\\omega^2 + \\omega \\cdot \\omega^2 + \\omega^2 = \\omega^2 + \\omega^3 + \\omega^2 = \\omega^2 + 1 + \\omega^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This matches the given equation! So,  \n\\(a\\)  \nand  \n\\(b\\)  \nare likely cube roots of unity. This seems like a promising path.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Cube Roots of Unity**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Now that we've identified  \n\\(a\\)  \nand  \n\\(b\\)  \nas cube roots of unity, let's see how we can use this to evaluate the given expression  \n\\(\\frac{a^9 + b^9}{(a + b)^9}\\).\n\n- **Calculating Powers of  \n\\(a\\)  \nand  \n\\(b\\):**\n  - Since  \n\\(\\omega^3 = 1\\),  \nany power of  \n\\(\\omega\\)  \ncan be reduced modulo 3:\n\n\\[\na^9 = \\omega^9 = (\\omega^3)^3 = 1^3 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nb^9 = \\omega^{18} = (\\omega^3)^6 = 1^6 = 1\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, that seems too simple. Let's double-check whether  \n\\(a\\)  \nand  \n\\(b\\)  \nare  \n\\(\\omega\\)  \nand  \n\\(\\omega^2\\)  \nrespectively, and ensure we're applying the powers correctly.\n\n- **Double-checking:**\n  - If  \n\\(a = \\omega\\),  \nthen  \n\\(a^9 = (\\omega^3)^3 = 1\\).\n  - Similarly, if  \n\\(b = \\omega^2\\),  \nthen  \n\\(b^9 = (\\omega^2)^9 = (\\omega^6)^3 = 1^3 = 1\\).\n  \n- **Conclusion:** So,  \n\\(a^9 + b^9 = 1 + 1 = 2\\).\n\n#### **Calculating the Denominator  \n\\((a + b)^9\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Next, we need to find  \n\\((a + b)^9\\).  \nBut first, let's determine  \n\\(a + b\\).\n\n- **Calculating  \n\\(a + b\\):**\n  - Since  \n\\(a\\)  \nand  \n\\(b\\)  \nare  \n\\(\\omega\\)  \nand  \n\\(\\omega^2\\),  \nwe have:\n\n\\[\na + b = \\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\n\\]\n(because  \n\\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\))\n  \n- **Calculating  \n\\((a + b)^9\\):**\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^9 = (-1)^9 = -1\n\\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** So, the denominator is  \n\\(-1\\).  \nThis seems correct given that  \n\\(a + b = -1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Now we can plug these values into the original expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^9 + b^9}{(a + b)^9} = \\frac{2}{-1} = -2\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Does this result make sense? Given the properties of cube roots of unity and the symmetry in the problem, a result of  \n\\(-2\\)  \nseems plausible.\n\n- **Quick Check:** \n  - The numerator  \n\\(a^9 + b^9 = 2\\)  \nmakes sense because both  \n\\(a\\)  \nand  \n\\(b\\)  \nare roots of unity raised to a multiple of their order.\n  - The denominator  \n\\((a + b)^9 = -1\\)  \naligns with  \n\\(a + b = -1\\).\n  \n- **Conclusion:** Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^9 + b^9}{(a + b)^9} = -2\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n  - Yes, the negative sign arises from raising  \n\\((-1)\\)  \nto the ninth power, and the factor of 2 comes from the sum of the ninth powers of  \n\\(a\\)  \nand  \n\\(b\\).\n\n- **Was the Approach Correct?**\n  - Identifying  \n\\(a\\)  \nand  \n\\(b\\)  \nas cube roots of unity was key. Initial attempts to express  \n\\(b\\)  \nin terms of  \n\\(a\\)  \ndidn't simplify the problem, but recognizing the connection to roots of unity provided a straightforward path.\n\n- **Lesson Learned:**\n  - Sometimes, familiar patterns like roots of unity can significantly simplify complex problems. It's essential to explore different strategies and be willing to pivot when the initial approach doesn't yield results.\n\n---\n\nThat's it! By thinking through the problem step-by-step, reflecting on each strategy, and checking the work along the way, we arrived at the correct solution naturally.",
  "ground_truth": "Since $a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0,$ $(a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = 0.$  This simplifies to $a^3 - b^3 = 0,$ so $a^3 = b^3.$\n\nThen $b^9 = a^9.$  Also,\n\\[(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a^2 + ab + b^2) + ab = ab,\\]so\n\\[(a + b)^3 = ab(a + b) = a(ab + b^2) = a(-a^2) = -a^3.\\]Then $(a + b)^9 = (-a^3)^3 = -a^9,$ so\n\\[\\frac{a^9 + b^9}{(a + b)^9} = \\frac{2a^9}{-a^9} = \\boxed{-2}.\\]"
