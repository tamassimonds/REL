  "problem": "An urn contains $4$ green balls and $6$ blue balls. A second urn contains $16$ green balls and $N$ blue balls. A single ball is drawn at random from each urn. The probability that both balls are of the same color is $0.58$. Find $N$.\n",
  "solution": "To solve the problem involving two urns and the probability of drawing two balls of the same color, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Contents of the Urns**:\n   - **First Urn**: Contains 4 green balls and 6 blue balls, totaling \\( 4 + 6 = 10 \\) balls.\n   - **Second Urn**: Contains 16 green balls and \\( N \\) blue balls, totaling \\( 16 + N \\) balls.\n\n2. **Calculate the Probabilities**:\n   We evaluate two scenarios where both drawn balls are of the same color: both green or both blue.\n\n   - **Both Balls are Green**:\n     - Probability of drawing a green ball from the first urn: \n       \\[\n       P(G_1) = \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4\n       \\]\n     - Probability from the second urn:\n       \\[\n       P(G_2) = \\frac{16}{16 + N}\n       \\]\n     - Combined probability for both being green:\n       \\[\n       P(G_1 \\cap G_2) = 0.4 \\cdot \\frac{16}{16 + N}\n       \\]\n\n   - **Both Balls are Blue**:\n     - Probability of drawing a blue ball from the first urn:\n       \\[\n       P(B_1) = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6\n       \\]\n     - Probability from the second urn:\n       \\[\n       P(B_2) = \\frac{N}{16 + N}\n       \\]\n     - Combined probability for both being blue:\n       \\[\n       P(B_1 \\cap B_2) = 0.6 \\cdot \\frac{N}{16 + N}\n       \\]\n\n3. **Total Probability of Drawing the Same Color**:\n   We sum the probabilities from both scenarios:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{same color}) = P(G_1 \\cap G_2) + P(B_1 \\cap B_2 = 0.4 \\cdot \\frac{16}{16 + N} + 0.6 \\cdot \\frac{N}{16 + N}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set the Total Probability Equal to 0.58**:\n   Establishing the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.4 \\cdot \\frac{16}{16 + N} + 0.6 \\cdot \\frac{N}{16 + N} = 0.58\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Equation**:\n   This can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{0.4 \\cdot 16 + 0.6N}{16 + N} = 0.58\n   \\]\n   Multiplying both sides by \\( 16 + N \\):\n   \\[\n   0.4 \\cdot 16 + 0.6N = 0.58(16 + N)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Expanding and Rearranging**:\n   After expanding, we have:\n   \\[\n   6.4 + 0.6N = 9.28 + 0.58N\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   0.6N - 0.58N = 9.28 - 6.4\n   \\]\n   Which simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   0.02N = 2.88\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solving for \\( N \\)**:\n   Finally, we find:\n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{2.88}{0.02} = 144\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( N \\) is **144**. \n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>144 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "First, we find the probability both are green, then the probability both are blue, and add the two probabilities. The sum should be equal to $0.58$.\nThe probability both are green is $\\frac{4}{10}\\cdot\\frac{16}{16+N}$, and the probability both are blue is $\\frac{6}{10}\\cdot\\frac{N}{16+N}$, so\\[\\frac{4}{10}\\cdot\\frac{16}{16+N}+\\frac{6}{10}\\cdot\\frac{N}{16+N}=\\frac{29}{50}\\]Solving this equation,\\[20\\left(\\frac{16}{16+N}\\right)+30\\left(\\frac{N}{16+N}\\right)=29\\]Multiplying both sides by $16+N$, we get\\[20\\cdot 16 + 30\\cdot N = 29(16+n)\\Rightarrow 320+30N=464+29N \\Rightarrow N = \\boxed{144}\\]"
