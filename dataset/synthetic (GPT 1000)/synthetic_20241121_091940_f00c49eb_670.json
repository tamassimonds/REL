  "problem": "Henry's little brother has $8$ identical stickers and $4$ identical sheets of paper. How many ways are there for him to put all of the stickers on the sheets of paper, if only the number of stickers on each sheet matters?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of ways to distribute 8 identical stickers across 4 identical sheets of paper, we need to count the distinct partitions of the number 8 into up to 4 parts. Each partition represents a unique distribution of stickers to the sheets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Problem Understanding**: We are interested in finding how many different ways we can assign 8 identical stickers to 4 identical sheets, focusing only on the distributions of stickers.\n\n2. **Finding Partitions**: Our goal is to list the possible partitions of the number 8 that consist of at most 4 parts. Each partition must be listed in non-increasing order to ensure distinctiveness.\n\n3. **Listing the Partitions**:\n   - \\(8\\) (8-0-0-0)\n   - \\(7 + 1\\) (7-1-0-0)\n   - \\(6 + 2\\) (6-2-0-0)\n   - \\(6 + 1 + 1\\) (6-1-1-0)\n   - \\(5 + 3\\) (5-3-0-0)\n   - \\(5 + 2 + 1\\) (5-2-1-0)\n   - \\(5 + 1 + 1 + 1\\) (5-1-1-1)\n   - \\(4 + 4\\) (4-4-0-0)\n   - \\(4 + 3 + 1\\) (4-3-1-0)\n   - \\(4 + 2 + 2\\) (4-2-2-0)\n   - \\(4 + 2 + 1 + 1\\) (4-2-1-1)\n   - \\(3 + 3 + 2\\) (3-3-2-0)\n   - \\(3 + 3 + 1 + 1\\) (3-3-1-1)\n   - \\(3 + 2 + 2 + 1\\) (3-2-2-1)\n   - \\(2 + 2 + 2 + 2\\) (2-2-2-2)\n\n4. **Counting the Partitions**: After listing all distinct partitions, we find that there are 15 different partitions of 8 into at most 4 parts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the total number of unique ways for Henry's little brother to distribute all 8 stickers onto 4 sheets of paper is:\n\n**15**",
  "ground_truth": "Since only the number of stickers on the sheets matters, we can list the possibilities systematically:  \\begin{align*}\n& 8-0-0-0 \\\\\n& 7-1-0-0 \\\\\n& 6-2-0-0 \\\\\n& 6-1-1-0 \\\\\n& 5-3-0-0 \\\\\n& 5-2-1-0 \\\\\n& 5-1-1-1 \\\\\n& 4-4-0-0 \\\\\n& 4-3-1-0 \\\\\n& 4-2-2-0 \\\\\n& 4-2-1-1 \\\\\n& 3-3-2-0 \\\\\n& 3-3-1-1 \\\\\n& 3-2-2-1 \\\\\n& 2-2-2-2\n\\end{align*} There are $\\boxed{15}$ possible arrangements of stickers on sheets of paper."
