  "problem": "Let $\\triangle ABC$ be a right triangle such that $B$ is a right angle. A circle with diameter of $BC$ meets side $AC$ at $D.$ If $AD = 1$ and $BD = 4,$ then what is $CD$?",
  "solution": "To find the length \\( CD \\) in the right triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) where \\( B \\) is the right angle and a circle with diameter \\( BC \\) intersects \\( AC \\) at point \\( D \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Known Values**: We have \\( AD = 1 \\) and \\( BD = 4 \\). We want to determine \\( CD \\), which we will denote as \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Analyze the Geometry**: Since \\( BC \\) acts as the diameter of the circle, it implies that \\( \\angle BDC = 90^\\circ \\). This relationship allows us to employ the properties of similar triangles.\n\n3. **Establish Similar Triangles**: The triangles \\( \\triangle ADB \\) and \\( \\triangle BDC \\) are similar to triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) because they share angles and each have a right angle. This gives us the proportion:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{AD}{BD} = \\frac{BD}{CD}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set Up the Proportion**: Plugging the known values into the proportion yields:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{4}{x}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\)**: Cross-multiplying gives us:\n   \\[\n   1 \\cdot x = 4 \\cdot 4,\n   \\]\n   simplifying to:\n   \\[\n   x = 16.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Result**: Therefore, the length \\( CD \\) is \\( 16 \\).\n\nIn summary, we find that:\n\\[\n\\text{Thus, the answer is } \\boxed{16}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "We might try sketching a diagram: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pO, pD;\npA = (-5, 0);\npB = (0, 0);\npC = (0, 20);\npO = (0, 10);\npD = (-80/17, 20/17);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pD--pB);\ndraw(circle(pO, 10));\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, S);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", pD, NE);\n[/asy] Since $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, that makes $\\angle BDC$ a right angle. Then, by $AA$ similarity, we see that $\\triangle ADB \\sim \\triangle BDC \\sim \\triangle ABC.$ Then, $\\frac{BD}{AD} = \\frac{CD}{BD},$ so $CD = \\frac{BD^2}{AD} = \\frac{4^2}{1} = \\boxed{16}.$"
