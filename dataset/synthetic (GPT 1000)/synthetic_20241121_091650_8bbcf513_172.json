  "solution": "To find the sum of all positive even factors of \\(504\\), we will go through the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization\n\nWe start by determining the prime factorization of \\(504\\):\n\\[\n504 \\div 2 = 252 \\\\\n252 \\div 2 = 126 \\\\\n126 \\div 2 = 63 \\\\\n63 \\div 3 = 21 \\\\\n21 \\div 3 = 7 \\\\\n7 \\div 7 = 1\n\\]\nThus, the complete prime factorization of \\(504\\) is:\n\\[\n504 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Finding the Sum of All Factors\n\nThe formula to calculate the sum of the factors (denoted as \\(\\sigma(n)\\)) given the prime factorization \\(p_1^{k_1} \\times p_2^{k_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_m^{k_m}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\ldots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\ldots + p_2^{k_2}) \\ldots (1 + p_m + p_m^2 + \\ldots + p_m^{k_m})\n\\]\n\nApplying this to \\(504\\):\n\\[\n\\sigma(504) = (1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3)(1 + 3 + 3^2)(1 + 7)\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n1. \\(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 15\\)\n2. \\(1 + 3 + 3^2 = 13\\)\n3. \\(1 + 7 = 8\\)\n\nNow, we find the product:\n\\[\n\\sigma(504) = 15 \\times 13 \\times 8\n\\]\nCalculating \\(15 \\times 13\\):\n\\[\n15 \\times 13 = 195\n\\]\nThen, multiplying by \\(8\\):\n\\[\n195 \\times 8 = 1560\n\\]\nThus, the sum of all factors of \\(504\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sigma(504) = 1560\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Sum of Even Factors\n\nTo find the sum of all even factors, we express each even factor as \\(2^k \\times m\\) where \\(k \\geq 1\\) (ensuring at least one factor of \\(2\\)) and \\(m\\) is any factor of \\(\\frac{504}{2} = 252\\).\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of \\(252\\):\n\\[\n252 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1\n\\]\nNow, we calculate the sum of all factors of \\(252\\):\n\\[\n\\sigma(252) = (1 + 2 + 2^2)(1 + 3 + 3^2)(1 + 7)\n\\]\nCalculating each term:\n1. \\(1 + 2 + 2^2 = 7\\)\n2. \\(1 + 3 + 3^2 = 13\\)\n3. \\(1 + 7 = 8\\)\n\nNow, we find the product:\n\\[\n\\sigma(252) = 7 \\times 13 \\times 8\n\\]\nCalculating \\(7 \\times 13\\):\n\\[\n7 \\times 13 = 91\n\\]\nAnd then multiplying by \\(8\\):\n\\[\n91 \\times 8 = 728\n\\]\n\nSince \\(728\\) is the sum of all factors of \\(252\\), we now find the sum of the even factors of \\(504\\) by multiplying \\(728\\) by \\(2\\) (the factor we removed from \\(504\\) to get \\(252\\)):\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of even factors} = 2 \\times \\sigma(252) = 2 \\times 728 = 1456\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive even factors of \\(504\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1456}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "First, we find that the prime factorization of $504$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7$. Note that the even divisors of 504 are precisely the integers of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ where $1\\leq a \\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$. Note also that distributing $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)$ yields 18 terms, with each integer of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ (again, where $1\\leq a \\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$) appearing exactly once.  It follows that the sum of the even divisors of 504 is $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)=\\boxed{1456}$."
