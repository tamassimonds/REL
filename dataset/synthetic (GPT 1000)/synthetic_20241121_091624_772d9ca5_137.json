  "problem": "Find the product of all positive integral values of $n$ such that $n^2-35n+306= p$ for some prime number $p$. Note that there is at least one such $n$.",
  "solution": "To solve the equation \\( n^2 - 35n + 306 = p \\) for a prime number \\( p \\), we reformulate it into a standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - 35n + (306 - p) = 0\n\\]\n\nFor \\( n \\) to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square. The discriminant \\( D \\) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac = (-35)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (306 - p) = 1225 - 1224 + 4p = 1 + 4p\n\\]\n\nTo ensure \\( D \\) is a perfect square, we set:\n\n\\[\n1 + 4p = k^2 \\quad \\text{for some integer } k\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n\\[\n4p = k^2 - 1\n\\]\n\nFactoring the right-hand side yields:\n\n\\[\n4p = (k-1)(k+1)\n\\]\n\nSince \\( p \\) is a prime number, \\( (k-1)(k+1) \\) must be divisible by 4, leading us to investigate even and odd values for \\( k \\). It's beneficial to choose an even integer \\( k = 2m \\):\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{(2m - 1)(2m + 1)}{4} = \\frac{4m^2 - 1}{4} = m^2 - \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't produce an integer for most \\( m \\). Therefore, we consider odd \\( k \\): let \\( k = 2m + 1 \\):\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{(2m)(2m + 2)}{4} = m(m + 1)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( p \\) could theoretically be a product of two consecutive integers. We need \\( m(m + 1) \\) to yield prime numbers, so we should check small values of \\( k \\) to find suitable primes.\n\nEvaluating possible \\( k \\):\n\n- **For \\( k = 3 \\)**:\n    \\[\n    p = 2 \\quad (prime)\n    \\]\n  \n- **For \\( k = 5 \\)**:\n    \\[\n    p = 6 \\quad (not prime)\n    \\]\n\n- **For \\( k = 7 \\)**:\n    \\[\n    p = 12 \\quad (not prime)\n    \\]\n\nFollowing this method up to higher values of \\( k \\) yields non-prime or composite results, until we confirm \\( p = 2 \\) is suitable.\n\nSubstituting \\( p = 2 \\) back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - 35n + 304 = 0\n\\]\n\nCalculating the discriminant gives:\n\n\\[\nD = 35^2 - 4 \\cdot 304 = 1225 - 1216 = 9\n\\]\n\nAs \\( 9 \\) is a perfect square, we can find \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{35 \\pm 3}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating both values:\n\n1. \\( n = \\frac{38}{2} = 19 \\)\n2. \\( n = \\frac{32}{2} = 16 \\)\n\nThus the valid positive integral solutions for \\( n \\) are \\( 16 \\) and \\( 19 \\). The product of these values is:\n\n\\[\n16 \\cdot 19 = 304\n\\]\n\nIn conclusion, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{304}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "First we note that since $n^2-35n = n(n-35)$, and at least one of $n$ and $n-35$ is even, thus $n^2-35n$ is even. So $n^2-35n+306$ is also even. Thus the prime $p$ must equal 2. This means that we want the product of the positive integral solutions to $n^2-35n+306=2$, or $n^2-35n+304=0$.\n\nThe problem tells us that there is at least one positive integral solution. Now we use the fact that the product of the solutions to a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $c/a$, which equals 304 in this case. This means that both solutions must in fact be positive, since if only one were, their product would be negative. Additionally, the sum of the solutions is given by $-b/a$, which is 35 in this case. Since one solution is integral, and the sum of both solutions is integral, the other solution is integral as well. So we want the product of both, which is $\\boxed{304}$."
