  "problem": "Five couples were at a party. If each person shook hands exactly once with everyone else except his/her spouse, how many handshakes were exchanged? (Note: One obviously doesn't shake hands with oneself.)",
  "solution": "To determine the number of handshakes at a party attended by five couples, where each person shakes hands with everyone except their spouse, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Count the Total Number of People\nWith five couples at the party, the total number of attendees is:\n\\[ \n5 \\text{ couples} \\times 2 \\text{ people per couple} = 10 \\text{ people} \n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Handshakes Without Restrictions\nIf there were no restrictions on handshakes, each person could shake hands with the other nine attendees. The total number of handshakes can be calculated using the combinations formula:\n\\[ \n\\text{Handshakes} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \n\\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of people.\n\nFor our case:\n\\[ \n\\text{Handshakes} = \\frac{10(10-1)}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45 \n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Account for Handshakes Not Made\nSince each person does not shake hands with their spouse, we must subtract these handshakes. There are 5 couples, leading to 5 handshakes that are not exchanged.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Count of Handshakes\nThus, the total number of actual handshakes exchanged is:\n\\[ \n\\text{Actual Handshakes} = 45 - 5 = 40 \n\\]\n\nIn conclusion, the total number of handshakes exchanged at the party is:\n\n<ANSWER>40 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "There are a total of 10 people at the party.  Each shakes hands with everyone else, except for their spouse, which will be a total of $10-2=8$ other people.  The total number of handshakes will be $10\\cdot8/2=\\boxed{40}$, where we divide by 2 to correct for counting each handshake twice."
