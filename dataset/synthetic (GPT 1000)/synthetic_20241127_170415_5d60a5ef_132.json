  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, explore each one, and reflect along the way to ensure I'm on the right track. If something doesn't work, I'll backtrack and try a new approach. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Question\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the problem asks for the sum of the squares of the solutions to the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 13x + 4 = 0\\). \n\n- **Brainstorm:** This reminds me of finding roots of quadratics, and I recall that there are formulas involving the sum and product of roots. Maybe those could be useful here?\n- **Reflection:** Hmm, I haven\u2019t dealt specifically with summing the squares of solutions before, but it sounds like an extension of the sum of roots concept.\n\n---\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n- **Strategy 1: Using the Quadratic Formula**\n  - **Thought Process:** The quadratic formula gives the roots directly. Once I have the roots, I can square them and add them up.\n  - **Brainstorm:** Let\u2019s see if this is straightforward. Compute the roots first, then proceed.\n\n- **Strategy 2: Leveraging Vieta\u2019s Formulas**\n  - **Thought Process:** Vieta\u2019s formulas relate the sum and product of roots to the coefficients of the equation. Maybe I can use these to find the sum of the squares without explicitly finding the roots.\n  - **Brainstorm:** This might be more elegant and quicker than computing the roots directly.\n\n- **Strategy 3: Completing the Square**\n  - **Thought Process:** Completing the square could give insights into the behavior of the solutions, but I\u2019m not sure if it directly helps in summing the squares.\n  - **Brainstorm:** Might be a bit roundabout for this problem.\n\n**Reflection:** I think **Strategy 2 (Using Vieta\u2019s Formulas)** sounds promising and efficient. Let\u2019s start there, but I'll keep Strategy 1 as a backup in case it doesn\u2019t pan out.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Applying Vieta\u2019s Formulas\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nVieta\u2019s formulas state that for a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\):\n\n- The sum of the roots (\\(\\alpha + \\beta\\)) is \\(-\\frac{b}{a}\\).\n- The product of the roots (\\(\\alpha \\beta\\)) is \\(\\frac{c}{a}\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFor our equation \\(x^2 - 13x + 4 = 0\\):\n\n- \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -13\\), \\(c = 4\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\alpha + \\beta = -\\frac{-13}{1} = 13\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\alpha \\beta = \\frac{4}{1} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThat seems correct. The sum of the roots is 13, and their product is 4. Vieta\u2019s formulas are straightforward here.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Expressing the Sum of Squares in Terms of Sum and Product\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI remember that the sum of the squares of the roots can be expressed in terms of their sum and product:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 = (\\alpha + \\beta)^2 - 2\\alpha \\beta\n\\]\n\n- **Brainstorm:** This formula looks perfect because I already have \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\) and \\(\\alpha \\beta\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFirst, compute \\((\\alpha + \\beta)^2\\):\n\n\\[\n(\\alpha + \\beta)^2 = 13^2 = 169\n\\]\n\nNext, use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 = 169 - 2 \\times 4 = 169 - 8 = 161\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach worked smoothly. The calculations are straightforward, and the result makes sense. \n\n- **Quick Check:** \\(169 - 8 = 161\\) looks correct.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verifying the Solution Using Quadratic Formula (Backup Strategy)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAlthough Strategy 2 worked, it's always good to verify with another method to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Brainstorm:** Let\u2019s briefly use the quadratic formula to find the roots and then compute their squares to see if we get the same result.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in our values:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{13^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times 4}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{169 - 16}}{2} = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{153}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the roots are:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{13 + \\sqrt{153}}{2}, \\quad \\beta = \\frac{13 - \\sqrt{153}}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, compute \\(\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 = \\left(\\frac{13 + \\sqrt{153}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{13 - \\sqrt{153}}{2}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 = \\frac{(13 + \\sqrt{153})^2 + (13 - \\sqrt{153})^2}{4}\n\\]\n\nExpanding both squares:\n\n\\[\n(13 + \\sqrt{153})^2 = 169 + 2 \\times 13 \\times \\sqrt{153} + 153 = 322 + 26\\sqrt{153}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(13 - \\sqrt{153})^2 = 169 - 2 \\times 13 \\times \\sqrt{153} + 153 = 322 - 26\\sqrt{153}\n\\]\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[\n322 + 26\\sqrt{153} + 322 - 26\\sqrt{153} = 644\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 = \\frac{644}{4} = 161\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth methods agree! The sum of the squares is indeed 161. \n\n- **Check:** Using two different strategies and arriving at the same result confirms the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<ANSWER> The sum of the squares of the solutions is \\(161\\). </ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### Final Reflection\n\n- **Brainstorm Recap:** Initially considered multiple approaches, chose the most efficient one, and kept a backup for verification.\n- **Check Points:** Regularly checked calculations and consistency between different methods.\n- **Verification:** Used a secondary method (quadratic formula) to confirm the primary method\u2019s result.\n- **Conclusion:** Multiple strategies converging on the same answer strengthen the correctness of the solution.\n\nBy thinking through various strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying results, I've ensured the solution is accurate and reliable.",
  "ground_truth": "Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this polynomial. Therefore, $r_1+r_2=13$ and $r_1r_2=4$. Notice that $r_1^2+2r_1r_2+r_2^2=169$. This means that the sum of the squares of the roots can be obtained by subtracting the term containing the product of $r_1$ and $r_2$, so $r_1^2+r_2^2=169-2(4)=\\boxed{161}$."
