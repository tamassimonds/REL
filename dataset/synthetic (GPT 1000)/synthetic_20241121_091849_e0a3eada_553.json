  "solution": "To solve the problem involving the triangle formed by points on a semicircle, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Geometry**: \n   Place the semicircle on a coordinate plane with its diameter \\( AB \\) aligned horizontally and centered at the origin. We designate the points as \\( A = (-r, 0) \\), \\( B = (r, 0) \\), and \\( C = (x, y) \\), constrained by the semicircle equation \\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Distances from Point \\( C \\)**:\n   We compute the distances \\( AC \\) and \\( BC \\) using the distance formula.\n   - For \\( AC \\):\n     \\[\n     AC = \\sqrt{(x + r)^2 + y^2} = \\sqrt{2r(x + r)}\n     \\]\n   - For \\( BC \\):\n     \\[\n     BC = \\sqrt{(x - r)^2 + y^2} = \\sqrt{2r(r - x)}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Sum the Distances**:\n   The total distance \\( s \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   s = AC + BC = \\sqrt{2r(x + r)} + \\sqrt{2r(r - x)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**:\n   To find an upper bound for \\( s^2 \\), we use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:\n   \\[\n   s^2 = (AC + BC)^2 \\leq 2(AC^2 + BC^2)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compute \\( AC^2 \\) and \\( BC^2 \\)**:\n   Substituting our earlier results:\n   - \\( AC^2 = 2r(x + r) \\)\n   - \\( BC^2 = 2r(r - x) \\)\n   Adding these yields:\n   \\[\n   AC^2 + BC^2 = 2r(x + r) + 2r(r - x) = 4r^2\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Calculation**:\n   Inserting back into our bound gives:\n   \\[\n   s^2 \\leq 2(4r^2) = 8r^2\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum possible value for \\( s^2 \\) is \\( 8r^2 \\), achievable when point \\( C \\) is positioned at the highest point of the semicircle.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\ns^2 \\leq 8r^2\n\\]",

Since $\\triangle ABC$ is inscribed and $AB$ is the diameter, $\\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle, and by the Pythagorean Theorem, $AC^2 + BC^2 = AC^2 = (2r)^2$. Thus, $s^2 = 4r^2 + 2 \\cdot AC \\cdot BC$.\nThe area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{AC \\cdot BC}{2}$, so $2 \\cdot [ABC] = AC \\cdot BC$. That means $s^2 = 4r^2 + 4 \\cdot [ABC]$. The area of $\\triangle ABC$ can also be calculated by using base $AB$ and the altitude from $C$. The maximum possible value of the altitude is $r$, so the maximum area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $r^2$.\nTherefore, $\\boxed{s^2 \\le 8r^2}$"
