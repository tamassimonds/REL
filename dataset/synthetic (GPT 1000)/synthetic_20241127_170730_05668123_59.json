  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll take you through my thought process just like I would if I were working on it myself\u2014brainstorming different strategies, checking for correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question is to express \\(\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x\\) as a product of trigonometric functions. Immediately, I recognize this as a trigonometric identity problem. I recall that there are sum-to-product identities that might be useful here. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure which one fits best right off the bat. So, I\u2019ll need to explore a few strategies to see what works.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Approaches**\n\n1. **Sum-to-Product Identities:**  \n   These identities are designed to convert sums of sines or cosines into products. It seems like a good fit, but I'll need to double-check if they apply directly to this problem.\n\n2. **Using Angle Addition Formulas:**  \n   Maybe I can break down the sine functions into their components using angle addition formulas. This might complicate things, but it's worth considering.\n\n3. **Factoring Techniques:**  \n   Perhaps factoring out a common sine term could simplify the expression.\n\n4. **Alternative Trigonometric Identities:**  \n   There might be other identities I'm not immediately thinking of that could help.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the sum-to-product identities since they seem most directly applicable. If that doesn\u2019t work, I'll try the next idea.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Sum-to-Product Identities**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe sum-to-product identities are:\n\n\\[\n\\sin A + \\sin B = 2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{A + B}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{A - B}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nGiven our expression \\(\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x\\), let's set:\n- \\(A = 4x\\)\n- \\(B = 6x\\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x = 2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{4x + 6x}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{4x - 6x}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the arguments:\n\n\\[\n= 2 \\sin(5x) \\cos(-x)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute, \\(\\cos(-x)\\) can be simplified further. I remember that cosine is an even function, so \\(\\cos(-x) = \\cos(x)\\). Let\u2019s apply that.\n\n\\[\n= 2 \\sin(5x) \\cos(x)\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThis looks neat, but let me verify if it makes sense. By applying the identity, I transformed the sum into a product. It aligns with what the sum-to-product identities are supposed to do.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis approach seems correct. The sum \\(\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x\\) is successfully expressed as a product: \\(2 \\sin(5x) \\cos(x)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Using Angle Addition Formulas**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nJust to double-check, let's see if using angle addition formulas would lead us to the same result or if it's even a viable path. This might not be the most straightforward method, but exploring different strategies is always helpful.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nExpress \\(\\sin 4x\\) and \\(\\sin 6x\\) using angle addition formulas:\n\n\\[\n\\sin 4x = \\sin(2x + 2x) = 2 \\sin 2x \\cos 2x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin 6x = \\sin(4x + 2x) = 2 \\sin 4x \\cos 2x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, this is getting complicated. I now have expressions involving \\(\\sin 2x\\), \\(\\cos 2x\\), and \\(\\sin 4x\\). It doesn't seem to simplify easily into a product form like we achieved with the sum-to-product identity.\n\n**Check:**  \nThis approach is leading to more complexity rather than simplification. It\u2019s not as efficient as the first method.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAngle addition formulas aren't the best strategy here. The sum-to-product identity is definitely the more straightforward and effective approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, I\u2019ll do a quick mental check to ensure the solution makes sense. By converting the sum of sines into a product, we've likely made the expression easier to work with for integration or solving equations, which is often the goal of such transformations.\n\n**Quick Verification:**  \nIf I plug in a simple value for \\(x\\), say \\(x = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin(4 \\times 0) + \\sin(6 \\times 0) = 0 + 0 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\sin(5 \\times 0) \\cos(0) = 2 \\times 0 \\times 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nBoth sides equal zero, which is consistent. Of course, checking more values would provide greater confidence, but this seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the correctness, the best approach is using the sum-to-product identity. Therefore, the expression \\(\\sin 4x + \\sin 6x\\) as a product of trigonometric functions is:\n\n\\(<ANSWER> \\sin 4x + \\sin 6x = 2 \\sin(5x) \\cos(x) </ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy starting with the most applicable identity, verifying its correctness, and considering alternative methods, I ensured that the solution is both accurate and efficient. It's important to remain flexible and open to exploring different strategies, even if the first approach works, to deepen understanding and confirm correctness.",
