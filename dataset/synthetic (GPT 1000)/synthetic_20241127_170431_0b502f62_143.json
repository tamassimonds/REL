  "problem": "Two years ago there were 20 trailer homes on Elm Street with an average age of 18 years. At that time, a group of brand new trailer homes was then added to Elm Street. Today, the average age of all the trailer homes on Elm Street is 14 years. How many new trailer homes were added two years ago?",
  "solution": "# **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. At first glance, it involves averages and changes over time. I remember tackling similar problems where adding new elements affects the overall average. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure of the best approach right now. Let's brainstorm a few strategies:\n\n1. **Understanding Averages Over Time:** Since the average age decreased when new homes were added, perhaps we need to balance the ages before and after adding the new homes.\n\n2. **Setting Up Equations:** Maybe setting up an equation to represent the total age of all homes before and after the new ones were added could work.\n\n3. **Trial and Error:** We could try assuming a certain number of new homes and see if the average works out.\n\nI think starting with setting up equations makes sense, but I'll keep the other strategies in mind in case this doesn't work out. Let's proceed step by step and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Two Years Ago:** There were 20 trailer homes with an average age of 18 years.\n- **Addition of New Homes:** A group of brand-new homes was added.\n- **Today:** The average age of all homes is now 14 years.\n\nWait a minute, the average age decreased even though time passed and new homes were added. This means the new homes must be significantly younger, which makes sense since they were brand new at the time.\n\n**First Check:**\n\nDoes this information align? Yes, adding newer homes should lower the overall average age.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Calculating the Total Age Two Years Ago**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf there were 20 homes with an average age of 18 years, I can calculate the total combined age of all the homes at that time.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Age Two Years Ago} = \\text{Number of Homes} \\times \\text{Average Age} = 20 \\times 18 = 360 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, multiplying the number of homes by the average age gives the total age. That seems correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Considering the Passage of Time**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince two years have passed, each of the original homes has aged by two years. So, I need to account for this increase in total age.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Age of Original Homes Today} = 360 + (20 \\times 2) = 360 + 40 = 400 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nAdding two years to each of the 20 homes equals 40 years in total. Adding this to the original total age makes sense.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Introducing the New Trailer Homes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe new homes were brand new two years ago, so their age today would be two years.\n\n- Let \\( n \\) be the number of new trailer homes added.\n- Each new home has an age of 2 years today.\n\n**Initial Idea:**\n\nI can calculate the total age contributed by the new homes and then find the overall total age.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Age of New Homes} = n \\times 2 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\n**Brainstorm:**\n\nWait, maybe I can set up an equation for the total age today, including both original and new homes.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Setting Up the Total Age Today**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe total age of all homes today includes the age of the original homes and the new homes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Age Today} = \\text{Total Age of Original Homes} + \\text{Total Age of New Homes} = 400 + (n \\times 2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Age Today} = 400 + 2n\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this equation correctly represent the total age? Yes, it sums up the age of all homes.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Using the Average Age Today**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe problem states that the average age of all trailer homes today is 14 years. I can use this information to set up another equation.\n\n- Total number of homes today = 20 original + \\( n \\) new\n- Average age = Total age / Total number of homes\n\n\\[\n14 = \\frac{400 + 2n}{20 + n}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this equation make sense? Yes, it's the definition of average age.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 7: Solving the Equation for \\( n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to solve this equation for \\( n \\) to find the number of new homes added. Let's cross-multiply to eliminate the denominator.\n\n\\[\n14(20 + n) = 400 + 2n\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[\n280 + 14n = 400 + 2n\n\\]\n\n**Brainstorm:**\n\nSubtract \\( 2n \\) from both sides to get all \\( n \\) terms on one side.\n\n\\[\n280 + 12n = 400\n\\]\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nSubtract 280 from both sides to isolate the \\( n \\) term.\n\n\\[\n12n = 120\n\\]\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\nDivide both sides by 12 to solve for \\( n \\).\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{120}{12} = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this value make sense? Let's do a quick check to verify.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 8: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nAlways good to check if the solution makes sense by plugging it back into the original scenario.\n\n- Total number of homes today = 20 + 10 = 30\n- Total age today = 400 (original) + 20 (new homes) = 420 years\n- Average age = \\( \\frac{420}{30} = 14 \\) years\n\n\\[\n\\frac{420}{30} = 14 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe calculated average matches the given average age today, so the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem to ensure our solution is robust.\n\n1. **Trial and Error:** Assume different numbers of new homes and calculate the average each time. However, this method would be time-consuming and less efficient.\n\n2. **Weighted Averages:** Use the concept of weighted averages to balance the ages of original and new homes. This would lead to the same equation we used.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOur initial approach of setting up an equation based on total age and average age seems to be the most straightforward and efficient method. Alternative strategies would ultimately lead to the same conclusion or require more time.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>10 new trailer homes were added two years ago.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\n\nThis problem required careful consideration of how averages change with the addition of new elements. By setting up equations to represent the total age before and after adding the new homes, we were able to solve for the unknown number of new homes. Verifying the solution by plugging it back into the original scenario ensured that our answer was correct.\n\nIt's always valuable to reflect on different strategies and ensure that the chosen method is the most efficient. In this case, setting up and solving equations provided a clear path to the solution.\n\nBy thinking through each step, checking our work along the way, and verifying the final answer, we ensured accuracy and gained a deeper understanding of the problem.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n10 new trailer homes were added two years ago.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThis problem required a thoughtful approach to understanding how averages change with the addition of new elements. By systematically setting up and solving equations, and verifying the solution through multiple strategies, we ensured the accuracy of our answer. Reflecting on different methods helped confirm that our initial approach was both efficient and correct, leading us to the final solution confidently.",
  "ground_truth": "The 20 original trailers are now an average of 20 years old, and the $n$ new trailers are all 2 years old.  There are $20+n$ trailers, and the sum of their ages is $20\\cdot20+2n$.  This gives us the equation  \\[\n\\frac{400+2n}{20+n}=14,\n\\] which we solve like this: \\begin{align*}\n400+2n &= 14(20+n) \\\\\n400+2n &= 280+14n \\\\\n120 &= 12n\n\\end{align*} We find that there are $n=\\boxed{10}$ new trailer homes."
