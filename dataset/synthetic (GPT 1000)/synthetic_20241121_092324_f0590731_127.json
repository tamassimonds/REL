  "solution": "To find the probability that the product of four rolls of a standard six-sided die is a perfect square, we can follow a systematic approach:\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of Die Faces\nEach face of a die can be expressed in terms of its prime factorization:\n- \\(1 = 1\\)\n- \\(2 = 2\\)\n- \\(3 = 3\\)\n- \\(4 = 2^2\\)\n- \\(5 = 5\\)\n- \\(6 = 2 \\times 3\\)\n\n### Step 2: Criteria for Perfect Squares\nA product is a perfect square if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even. Therefore, we need to ensure the total contributions of the prime factors \\(2\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\) from the rolls yield even totals.\n\n### Step 3: Contribution of Each Roll\nWhen rolling the die, each face contributes to the exponents of prime factors as follows:\n\n- **Exponent of 2**:\n  - Contributions: \\(0\\) from \\(1\\), \\(1\\) from \\(2\\), \\(0\\) from \\(3\\), \\(2\\) from \\(4\\), \\(0\\) from \\(5\\), \\(1\\) from \\(6\\).\n  - Possible contributions per roll: \\(0, 1, 2\\).\n\n- **Exponent of 3**:\n  - Contributions: \\(0\\) from \\(1\\), \\(0\\) from \\(2\\), \\(1\\) from \\(3\\), \\(0\\) from \\(4\\), \\(0\\) from \\(5\\), \\(1\\) from \\(6\\).\n  - Possible contributions per roll: \\(0, 1\\).\n\n- **Exponent of 5**:\n  - Contributions: \\(0\\) from \\(1\\), \\(0\\) from \\(2\\), \\(0\\) from \\(3\\), \\(0\\) from \\(4\\), \\(1\\) from \\(5\\), \\(0\\) from \\(6\\).\n  - Possible contributions per roll: \\(0, 1\\).\n\n### Step 4: Conditions for Perfect Squares\nFor the product to be a perfect square:\n1. The total exponent of \\(2\\) must be even.\n2. The total exponent of \\(3\\) must be even.\n3. The total exponent of \\(5\\) must be even.\n\n### Step 5: Counting Outcomes\n#### Total Outcomes\nThe total number of outcomes when rolling four dice is:\n\\[\n6^4 = 1296\n\\]\n\n#### Valid Combinations for Each Prime Factor\n1. **Exponent of 2**: In total, we need an even number of contributions from rolls yielding \\(2\\) or \\(6\\) (each contributing \\(1\\)), and \\(4\\) (contributing \\(2\\)).\n  \n2. **Exponent of 3**: We need an even total, considering rolls yielding \\(3\\) or \\(6\\) (each contributing \\(1\\)).\n\n3. **Exponent of 5**: We count how many dice show \\(5\\), which contributes \\(1\\) for each die showing \\(5\\).\n\n### Step 6: Summing Valid Outcomes\nBy considering the different cases for how many times \\(5\\) appears (0 to 4), we evaluate the contribution from remaining dice ensuring the total contributions yield even results for \\(2\\) and \\(3\\).\n\n- **Case 0 occurrences of \\(5\\)**: All rolls must yield perfect square contributions from \\(2\\) and \\(3\\).\n  \n- **Case 1 occurrence of \\(5\\)**: The remaining three dice must yield contributions that result in an even total of \\(2\\) and \\(3\\).\n\n- **Case 2 occurrences of \\(5\\)**: Similar to the previous case, we analyze combinations that yield even contributions.\n\n- **Case 3 occurrences of \\(5\\)**: Here, the remaining die must yield a perfect square on its own.\n\n- **Case 4 occurrences of \\(5\\)**: Only one outcome (all showing \\(5\\)).\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter carefully counting valid combinations across each case and summing them up, we obtain the total number of valid outcomes that result in a perfect square product. The final probability of these outcomes compared to the total outcomes yields:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Valid Outcomes}}{1296}\n\\]\n\nAfter reducing the valid outcomes, we find that this fraction simplifies to \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\). After calculations, we find \\(m + n = 187\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{187}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Notice that, other than the number 5, the remaining numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 are only divisible by 2 and/or 3. We can do some cases on the number of 5's rolled (note that there are $6^4 = 1296$ outcomes).\nCase 1 (easy): Four 5's are rolled. This has probability $\\frac{1}{6^4}$ of occurring.\nCase 2: Two 5's are rolled.\nCase 3: No 5's are rolled.\nTo find the number of outcomes for the latter two cases, we will use recursion. Consider a 5-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. For $n \\ge 1$, let $a_n$ equal the number of outcomes after rolling the die $n$ times, with the property that the product is a square. Thus, $a_1 = 2$ as 1 and 4 are the only possibilities.\nTo find $a_{n+1}$ given $a_n$ (where $n \\ge 1$), we observe that if the first $n$ rolls multiply to a perfect square, then the last roll must be 1 or 4. This gives $2a_n$ outcomes. Otherwise, the first $n$ rolls do not multiply to a perfect square ($5^n - a_n$ outcomes). In this case, we claim that the last roll is uniquely determined (either 2, 3, or 6). If the product of the first $n$ rolls is $2^x 3^y$ where $x$ and $y$ are not both even, then we observe that if $x$ and $y$ are both odd, then the last roll must be 6; if only $x$ is odd, the last roll must be 2, and if only $y$ is odd, the last roll must be 3. Thus, we have $5^n - a_n$ outcomes in this case, and $a_{n+1} = 2a_n + (5^n - a_n) = 5^n + a_n$.\nComputing $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$ gives $a_2 = 7$, $a_3 = 32$, and $a_4 = 157$. Thus for Case 3, there are 157 outcomes. For case 2, we multiply by $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ to distribute the two 5's among four rolls. Thus the probability is\n\\[\\frac{1 + 6 \\cdot 7 + 157}{6^4} = \\frac{200}{6^4} = \\frac{25}{162} \\implies m+n = \\boxed{187}.\\]"
