  "problem": "What is the area of the circle defined by $x^2-6x +y^2-14y +33=0$ that lies beneath the line $y=7$?",
  "solution": "To find the area of the portion of the circle defined by the equation \\(x^2-6x +y^2-14y +33=0\\) that lies beneath the line \\(y=7\\), we can follow these systematic steps:\n\n### Step 1: Rewrite the Circle's Equation in Standard Form\nStarting with the equation of the circle:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 6x + y^2 - 14y + 33 = 0\n\\]\n\nwe will complete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\n**For \\(x\\):**\n\\[\nx^2 - 6x = (x - 3)^2 - 9\n\\]\n\n**For \\(y\\):**\n\\[\ny^2 - 14y = (y - 7)^2 - 49\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these completed squares back into the equation yields:\n\n\\[\n((x - 3)^2 - 9) + ((y - 7)^2 - 49) + 33 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying gives:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 + (y - 7)^2 - 25 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 25\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the circle is centered at \\((3, 7)\\) with a radius of \\(5\\) (since \\(\\sqrt{25} = 5\\)).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Area Beneath the Line \\(y=7\\)\nThe line \\(y=7\\) runs directly through the center of the circle, evenly dividing it into two equal halves.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Area of the Circle\nThe area \\(A\\) of a circle is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi r^2\n\\]\n\nGiven that the radius \\(r\\) is \\(5\\), the total area is:\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi (5^2) = 25\\pi\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Area Beneath the Line\nSince the line \\(y = 7\\) perfectly bisects the circle, the area located beneath this line is half of the total area of the circle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area below } y = 7 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 25\\pi = \\frac{25\\pi}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the area of the circle defined by the equation \\(x^2-6x+y^2-14y+33=0\\) that lies beneath the line \\(y=7\\) is \n\n\\[\n\\frac{25\\pi}{2}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Add $(-6/2)^2$ and $(-14/2)^2$ to both sides of the equation to get \\[\n(x^2-6x +9) +(y^2-14y +49)=25,\n\\] which in turn can be rewritten as $(x-3)^2 +(y-7)^2 =5^2$.  The center of this circle is $(3,7)$, so the line $y=7$ passes through the center of the circle.  Hence, the area of the circle that lies below $y=7$ is half the area of the circle.  The radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{25} = 5$, so the circle has area $25\\pi$.  Therefore, half the area of the circle is $\\boxed{\\frac{25\\pi}{2}}$."
