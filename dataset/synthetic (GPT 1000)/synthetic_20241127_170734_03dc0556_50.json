  "problem": "Ben twice chooses a random integer between 1 and 50, inclusive (and he may choose the same integer both times). What is the probability that at least one of the numbers Ben chooses is a multiple of 3?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I would approach it naturally. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the question is about Ben choosing two random integers between 1 and 50, and we need to find the probability that at least one of those numbers is a multiple of 3. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of probability problems involving multiple trials and specific conditions. Maybe we can use complementary probability (finding the probability of the opposite event and subtracting from 1) or calculate directly using inclusion-exclusion principles. But I'm not entirely sure which is more efficient here.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Direct Probability:** Calculate the chance that at least one number is a multiple of 3 by considering all favorable outcomes.\n  2. **Complementary Probability:** Find the probability that neither number is a multiple of 3 and subtract from 1.\n  3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** Account for overlaps where both numbers are multiples of 3.\n\nLet me explore these strategies to see which one makes the most sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Direct Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's try to calculate the probability directly by considering all cases where at least one number is a multiple of 3. This includes scenarios where the first number is a multiple of 3, the second is a multiple of 3, or both are.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**  \n1. **Total Possible Outcomes:**  \n   - Since each number can be between 1 and 50, there are \\(50 \\times 50 = 2,500\\) total combinations.\n\n2. **Favorable Outcomes:**  \n   - We need to count all pairs where at least one number is a multiple of 3.\n\n3. **Listing Multiples of 3:**  \n   - Wait, manually listing might be tedious. Let's see how many multiples of 3 are there between 1 and 50 to make it easier.\n   - \\(50 \\div 3 = 16\\) multiples (since \\(3 \\times 16 = 48\\)).\n\n4. **Calculating Favorable Cases:**  \n   - **First Number is Multiple of 3:**  \n     - There are 16 options for the first number.\n     - For each of these, the second number can be any of the 50 numbers.\n     - So, \\(16 \\times 50 = 800\\) cases.\n   \n   - **Second Number is Multiple of 3:**  \n     - Similarly, \\(16 \\times 50 = 800\\) cases.\n   \n   - **Both Numbers are Multiples of 3:**  \n     - However, we've double-counted the cases where both numbers are multiples of 3.\n     - There are \\(16 \\times 16 = 256\\) such cases.\n\n5. **Applying Inclusion-Exclusion:**  \n   - Total Favorable Outcomes = \\(800 + 800 - 256 = 1,344\\).\n\n6. **Probability Calculation:**  \n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{1,344}{2,500} = \\frac{336}{625} = 0.5376\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, this approach seems valid, but the probability feels a bit high. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  - Total favorable outcomes: \\(1,344\\).\n  - Total possible outcomes: \\(2,500\\).\n  - Probability: \\(0.5376\\), which is over 50%, indicating a likely event. \n\n**Does It Make Sense?**  \nActually, it does make sense because multiples of 3 are fairly common within the range, and we're considering two numbers.\n\n**But Wait...**  \nThis method required calculating large numbers of cases and applying inclusion-exclusion, which might be prone to errors. Maybe there's a more straightforward way.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Complementary Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's try the complementary probability approach. This involves calculating the probability that neither number is a multiple of 3 and then subtracting from 1 to find the probability that at least one is.\n\n**Calculation Steps:**  \n1. **Probability of a Number Not Being a Multiple of 3:**  \n   - Total numbers: 50\n   - Multiples of 3: 16\n   - Non-multiples of 3: \\(50 - 16 = 34\\)\n   - Probability = \\(\\frac{34}{50} = \\frac{17}{25}\\)\n\n2. **Probability That Both Numbers Are Not Multiples of 3:**  \n   - Since each choice is independent, multiply the probabilities:\n   - \\(\\left(\\frac{17}{25}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{17}{25}\\right) = \\frac{289}{625}\\)\n\n3. **Complementary Probability:**  \n   - Probability that at least one number is a multiple of 3:\n   - \\(1 - \\frac{289}{625} = \\frac{336}{625} = 0.5376\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis approach is much cleaner and aligns with the previous result. It seems more straightforward and less prone to calculation errors.\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  - The probability of neither being a multiple is \\( \\frac{289}{625} \\approx 0.4624\\).\n  - Subtracting from 1 gives \\(0.5376\\), consistent with Strategy 1.\n\n**Does It Make Sense?**  \nYes, this method confirms the earlier result but with less computational overhead. It also reinforces the idea that using complementary probability can simplify such problems.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Validation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing the answer, let me reflect on both strategies and ensure consistency.\n\n- **Consistency Between Strategies:**  \n  - Both strategies yielded the same probability of \\(0.5376\\), which adds confidence to the correctness of the solution.\n\n- **Reasonableness of the Probability:**  \n  - Considering that multiples of 3 make up a significant portion of the numbers (16 out of 50), and we're selecting two numbers, it makes sense that the probability is above 50%.\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. Both strategies agree, and the probability seems reasonable given the conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThe probability that at least one of the numbers Ben chooses is a multiple of 3 is \\(\\frac{336}{625}\\) or 0.5376.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nBy exploring multiple strategies, checking for consistency, and validating the results through different approaches, we ensured the correctness of the solution. Complementary probability proved to be the more efficient method, but both strategies led us to the same conclusion.\n\n---",
  "ground_truth": "There are 16 multiples of 3 between 1 and 50 ($1\\cdot 3$ through $16\\cdot 3$), and $50-16=34$ numbers which are not multiples of 3. The probability that neither of the numbers Ben chooses is a multiple of 3 is $\\left( \\frac{34}{50} \\right)^2=\\frac{1156}{2500}$. Therefore, the probability that at least one of the numbers that Ben chooses is a multiple of 3 is $1-\\frac{1156}{2500}=\\frac{1344}{2500}=\\boxed{\\frac{336}{625}}$."
