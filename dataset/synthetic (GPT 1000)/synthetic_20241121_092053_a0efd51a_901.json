  "problem": "Nine people sit down at random seats around a round table. Four of them are math majors, three others are physics majors, and the two remaining people are biology majors. What is the probability that all four math majors sit in consecutive seats?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of finding the probability that all four math majors sit in consecutive seats at a round table with nine people, we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Arrangements\nTo determine the total arrangements of nine people at a round table, we fix one position to account for the circular organization. The number of arrangements is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total arrangements} = (9-1)! = 8! = 40320\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Treat Math Majors as a Block\nNext, we want to find the arrangements where the four math majors sit next to each other. We can treat these four math majors as a single \"block,\" reducing our problem to arranging this block alongside the other five individuals (three physics majors and two biology majors). \n\nThis results in:\n\n- 1 block of math majors\n- 3 physics majors\n- 2 biology majors\n\nThus, we have a total of 6 entities to arrange in a circle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Entities} = 1 \\text{ (math block)} + 3 \\text{ (physics)} + 2 \\text{ (biology)} = 6\n\\]\n\nThe number of arrangements of these 6 entities in a circle is:\n\n\\[\n(6-1)! = 5! = 120\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Arrange Math Majors Within Their Block\nWithin the block of math majors, the four math majors can be arranged in:\n\n\\[\n4! = 24 \\text{ ways}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Total Favorable Arrangements\nThe total number of favorable arrangements, where all math majors sit together, is the product of the arrangements of the 6 entities and the arrangements of the math majors within their block:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Favorable arrangements} = 5! \\times 4! = 120 \\times 24 = 2880\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Probability\nThe probability \\( P \\) that all four math majors sit in consecutive seats is the ratio of favorable arrangements to total arrangements:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Favorable arrangements}}{\\text{Total arrangements}} = \\frac{2880}{40320}\n\\]\n\nUpon simplification, we find:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{2880 \\div 2880}{40320 \\div 2880} = \\frac{1}{14}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the probability that all four math majors sit in consecutive seats is:\n\n**1/14**",
  "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{9}{4}=126$ ways to choose the seats for the four math majors. Of these ways, there are only 9 where the four math majors sit in consecutive seats. Therefore, the probability that the math majors sit in consecutive seats is $\\frac{9}{126}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{14}}$."
