  "problem": "There are 8 sprinters in the Olympic 100-meter finals. Three of the sprinters are Americans.  The gold medal goes to first place, silver to second, and bronze to third.   In how many ways can the medals be awarded if at most one American gets a medal?",
  "solution": "To determine the total number of ways to award medals such that at most one American wins, we will analyze two scenarios: \n\n1. No Americans win medals.\n2. Exactly one American wins a medal.\n\n### Scenario 1: No Americans Winning Medals\n\nGiven there are 8 sprinters in total\u20143 Americans and 5 non-Americans\u2014if no Americans can win medals, we only consider the 5 non-Americans. \n\nWe need to award 3 medals (gold, silver, and bronze) among these 5 non-Americans. Since the order of awarding matters, we use permutations to find the number of ways to choose and arrange 3 sprinters from 5:\n\n\\[\nP(5, 3) = \\frac{5!}{(5 - 3)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!} = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 = 60\n\\]\n\n### Scenario 2: Exactly One American Winning a Medal\n\nIn this scenario, we select 1 American to receive a medal and 2 non-Americans to receive the other two medals. \n\n1. **Choose 1 American**: There are 3 options.\n2. **Choose 2 non-Americans**: From the 5 non-Americans, we select 2. The number of ways to do this is calculated using combinations:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n\\]\n\nNext, we must arrange the 3 medalists (1 American and 2 non-Americans), which can occur in:\n\n\\[\n3! = 6 \\text{ ways}\n\\]\n\nNow, we combine these selections and arrangements:\n\n- Ways to choose the American: 3\n- Ways to choose the 2 non-Americans: 10\n- Ways to arrange all 3: 6\n\nThus, the total number of ways to award medals with exactly one American is:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 10 \\times 6 = 180\n\\]\n\n### Final Calculation: Combine the Two Scenarios\n\nTo find the total number of ways to award the medals with at most one American winning, we sum the results from both scenarios:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = \\text{Ways with no Americans} + \\text{Ways with exactly one American} = 60 + 180 = 240\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe total number of ways the medals can be awarded if at most one American gets a medal is:\n\n**240**",
  "ground_truth": "Consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: No Americans get a medal. So there are 5 choices for the gold medal, 4 choices for the silver, and 3 choices for bronze, which is $5\\times4\\times3=60$ ways.\n\nCase 2: One American gets a medal. There are 3 Americans to choose from. After we choose which American to get the medal, we have to decide which medal to reward the American, for which we have 3 choices. Then we have 5 choices for one of the remaining medal and 4 choices for the last medal. So, we have a total of $3\\times3\\times5\\times4=180$ ways.\n\nSum up the two cases, and we have a total of $180+60=\\boxed{240}$ ways."
