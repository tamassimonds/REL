  "ground_truth": "The given information tells us that $A = 90^\\circ -B$ and $A=kB$ for some $k\\ge1$.  Therefore, we have $kB = 90^\\circ - B$. This simplifies to $(k+1)B=90^\\circ$. $k+1$ can be any factor of $90$ except one, since $k+1\\ge2$. $90=2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5$ has $2\\cdot3\\cdot2=12$ factors, so there are 11 possible values of $k$. Each value of $k$ uniquely determines the value of $B$ and therefore the value of $A$, so there are $\\boxed{11}$ possible measures for $A$."
