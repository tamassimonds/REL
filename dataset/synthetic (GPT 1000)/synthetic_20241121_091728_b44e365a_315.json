  "solution": "To determine the volume of the cone formed from a 300-degree sector of a circle with a radius of 18, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Arc Length (Circumference of Base):**  \n   The arc length of the sector will serve as the circumference of the cone's base. We use the formula for arc length \\( L \\):\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{\\theta}{360} \\times 2\\pi r\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\theta = 300 \\) degrees and \\( r = 18 \\):\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{300}{360} \\times 2\\pi \\times 18 = \\frac{5}{6} \\times 36\\pi = 30\\pi\n   \\]\n   So, the circumference \\( C \\) of the base of the cone is \\( 30\\pi \\).\n\n2. **Find the Radius of the Cone's Base:**  \n   The circumference of a circle is given by \\( C = 2\\pi r \\). Setting this equal to our arc length:\n   \\[\n   30\\pi = 2\\pi r\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by \\( 2\\pi \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   r = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Height of the Cone:**  \n   The slant height \\( l \\) of the cone equals the radius of the original sector, which is 18. We can find the height \\( h \\) using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   \\[\n   l^2 = r^2 + h^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   18^2 = 15^2 + h^2 \\Rightarrow 324 = 225 + h^2 \\Rightarrow h^2 = 99\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   h = \\sqrt{99} = 3\\sqrt{11}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Volume of the Cone:**  \n   The volume \\( V \\) of a cone is given by:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we have:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (15^2)(3\\sqrt{11}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (225)(3\\sqrt{11}) = 225\\pi \\sqrt{11}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Divide the Volume by \\( \\pi \\):**  \n   Finally, we calculate the volume of the cone divided by \\( \\pi \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{V}{\\pi} = \\frac{225\\pi\\sqrt{11}}{\\pi} = 225\\sqrt{11}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, after performing all the calculations, the final result for the volume of the cone divided by \\( \\pi \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{225\\sqrt{11}}\n\\]",
