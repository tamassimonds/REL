  "problem": "An ancient human tribe had a hierarchical system where there existed one chief with 2 supporting chiefs (supporting chief A and supporting chief B), each of whom had 2 equal, inferior officers. If the tribe at one point had 10 members, what is the number of different ways to choose the leadership of the tribe?  That is, in how many ways can we choose a chief, 2 supporting chiefs, and two inferior officers reporting to each supporting chief?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of different ways to choose the leadership of the tribe, we follow this organized process:\n\n1. **Choose the Chief**: There are 10 members in the tribe, so we can select any one of them as the chief. Thus, there are 10 possible choices for the chief.\n\n2. **Choose the Supporting Chiefs**: After the chief is selected, 9 members remain. We need to choose 2 supporting chiefs (designated as Supporting Chief A and Supporting Chief B) from these 9 members, considering the order matters. We calculate this using the permutation formula \\( P(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \\):\n   \\[\n   P(9, 2) = \\frac{9!}{(9-2)!} = 9 \\times 8 = 72\n   \\]\n\n3. **Choose Inferior Officers for Supporting Chief A**: Now, we select 2 inferior officers for Supporting Chief A from the remaining 7 members. Since the order does not matter here, we use the combination formula \\( C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\):\n   \\[\n   C(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n   \\]\n\n4. **Choose Inferior Officers for Supporting Chief B**: After selecting the inferior officers for Supporting Chief A, we have 5 remaining members. We now choose 2 inferior officers for Supporting Chief B using the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Total Ways to Form Leadership**: The total number of configurations for the leadership is the product of the number of ways to choose each position:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total} = 10 \\text{ (chief)} \\times 72 \\text{ (supporting chiefs)} \\times 21 \\text{ (officers for A)} \\times 10 \\text{ (officers for B)}\n   \\]\n\nPerforming this multiplication:\n- \\( 10 \\times 72 = 720 \\)\n- \\( 720 \\times 21 = 15120 \\)\n- \\( 15120 \\times 10 = 151200 \\)\n\nTherefore, the total number of different ways to choose the tribe's leadership is\n\\[\n\\boxed{151200}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "There are 10 choices for the chief.  For each choice, there are 9 ways to choose supporting chief A, then 8 ways to choose supporting chief B.  There are then $\\binom{7}{2}$ ways to choose the inferior officers for the supporting chief A and $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose the inferior officers for the supporting chief B.  This gives us a total of $10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot \\binom{7}{2}\\cdot\\binom{5}{2} = \\boxed{151200}$ ways to form the leadership of the tribe."
