  "problem": "Square ABCD has its center at $(8,-8)$ and has an area of 4 square units. The top side of the square is horizontal. The square is then dilated with the dilation center at (0,0) and a scale factor of 2. What are the coordinates of the vertex of the image of square ABCD that is farthest from the origin? Give your answer as an ordered pair.",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find the coordinates of Square ABCD before dilation.\n\n1. **Calculate the side length of the square:**\n   The area is given as 4 square units, leading to a side length of:\n   \\[\n   \\text{side length} = \\sqrt{4} = 2.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the vertices of the square:**\n   The square is centered at (8, -8) with a side length of 2. The half side length is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{side length}}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n   The vertices can be calculated as follows:\n   - Top left: \\((8 - 1, -8 + 1) = (7, -7)\\)\n   - Top right: \\((8 + 1, -8 + 1) = (9, -7)\\)\n   - Bottom left: \\((8 - 1, -8 - 1) = (7, -9)\\)\n   - Bottom right: \\((8 + 1, -8 - 1) = (9, -9)\\)\n\n   Thus, the vertices of square ABCD are:\n   - A = (7, -7)\n   - B = (9, -7)\n   - C = (9, -9)\n   - D = (7, -9)\n\n### Step 2: Dilation of square ABCD around the origin.\n\n3. **Perform the dilation:**\n   We apply a dilation centered at (0, 0) with a scale factor of 2. The dilation transforms each vertex \\((x, y)\\) to \\((2x, 2y)\\). Applying this to each vertex:\n   - A\u2019 = \\(2(7, -7) = (14, -14)\\)\n   - B\u2019 = \\(2(9, -7) = (18, -14)\\)\n   - C\u2019 = \\(2(9, -9) = (18, -18)\\)\n   - D\u2019 = \\(2(7, -9) = (14, -18)\\)\n\n   The coordinates of the dilated square are therefore:\n   - A\u2019 = (14, -14)\n   - B\u2019 = (18, -14)\n   - C\u2019 = (18, -18)\n   - D\u2019 = (14, -18)\n\n### Step 3: Find the vertex farthest from the origin.\n\n4. **Calculate distances from the origin:**\n   The distance from a point \\((x, y)\\) to the origin is given by:\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.\n   \\]\n\n   Performing this calculation for each vertex:\n   - For A\u2019 (14, -14):\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{14^2 + (-14)^2} = \\sqrt{392} = 14\\sqrt{2}.\n     \\]\n   - For B\u2019 (18, -14):\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{18^2 + (-14)^2} = \\sqrt{520} = 2\\sqrt{130}.\n     \\]\n   - For C\u2019 (18, -18):\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{18^2 + (-18)^2} = \\sqrt{648} = 18\\sqrt{2}.\n     \\]\n   - For D\u2019 (14, -18):\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{14^2 + (-18)^2} = \\sqrt{520} = 2\\sqrt{130}.\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Compare the distances.\n\nThe distances are:\n- A\u2019: \\(14\\sqrt{2}\\)\n- B\u2019: \\(2\\sqrt{130}\\)\n- C\u2019: \\(18\\sqrt{2}\\)\n- D\u2019: \\(2\\sqrt{130}\\)\n\nComparing these, we find \\(18\\sqrt{2}\\) (from C\u2019) is larger than the others. Thus, C\u2019 = (18, -18) is the vertex farthest from the origin.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe coordinates of the vertex of the dilated square ABCD that is farthest from the origin are:\n<ANSWER>(18, -18)</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "With the center of dilation at the origin and a scale factor of 2, all the coordinates of square $ABCD$ are twice the coordinates of its preimage. The preimage has an area of 4 square units, so its side length is 2 units. Since the center of the preimage is at $(8, -8)$, the four vertices of the preimage are at $(7, -9), (7, -7), (9, -7)$ and $(9, -9)$. The point $(9, -9)$ is the farthest from the origin on the preimage, so the point farthest from the origin on the image of square $ABCD$ is $\\boxed{(18, -18)}.$"
