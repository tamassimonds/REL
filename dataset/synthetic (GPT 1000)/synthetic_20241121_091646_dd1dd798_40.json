  "problem": "There is only one value of $k$ for which the line $x=k$ intersects the graphs of $y=x^2+6x+5$ and $y=mx+b$ at two points which are exactly $5$ units apart. If the line $y=mx+b$ passes through the point $(1,6)$, and $b\\neq 0$, find the equation of the line.  Enter your answer in the form \"$y = mx + b$\".",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we need to find a linear equation of the form \\(y = mx + b\\) that intersects the parabola defined by \\(y = x^2 + 6x + 5\\) such that the distance between the intersection points is exactly 5 units apart, at some vertical line \\(x = k\\). It is also given that the line passes through the point \\((1, 6)\\) and that \\(b \\neq 0\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Intersection Points**:\n   - For the parabola at \\(x = k\\):\n     \\[\n     y = k^2 + 6k + 5\n     \\]\n   - For the line at the same \\(x\\):\n     \\[\n     y = mk + b\n     \\]\n\n2. **Distance Between Points**:\n   We want:\n   \\[\n   |(k^2 + 6k + 5) - (mk + b)| = 5\n   \\]\n   This leads to the equation:\n   \\[\n   |k^2 + (6 - m)k + (5 - b)| = 5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Two Cases**:\n   From the absolute value, we derive two equations:\n   - Case 1:\n     \\[\n     k^2 + (6 - m)k + (5 - b) = 5\n     \\]\n   - Case 2:\n     \\[\n     k^2 + (6 - m)k + (5 - b) = -5\n     \\]\n\n4. **Quadratic Equations**:\n   Rearranging these gives two quadratic equations:\n   - **Equation 1**:\n     \\[\n     k^2 + (6 - m)k + (b - 0) = 0\n     \\]\n   - **Equation 2**:\n     \\[\n     k^2 + (6 - m)k + (b + 10) = 0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Discriminant Conditions**:\n   - **For Equation 1**:\n     The discriminant must be non-negative:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta_1 = (6 - m)^2 - 4b \\geq 0\n     \\]\n   - **For Equation 2**:\n     The discriminant must be zero (for one solution):\n     \\[\n     \\Delta_2 = (6 - m)^2 - 4(b + 10) = 0\n     \\]\n\n6. **Solving the Discriminants**:\n   From \\(\\Delta_2\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   (6 - m)^2 = 4b + 40\n   \\]\n   From \\(\\Delta_1\\):\n   \\[\n   (6 - m)^2 \\geq 4b\n   \\]\n   Given both conditions, substituting \\((6 - m)^2 = 4b + 40\\) into \\((6 - m)^2 \\geq 4b\\) simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   40 \\geq 0 \\quad \\text{(always true)}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Using the Point (1, 6)**:\n   The line passes through \\((1, 6)\\):\n   \\[\n   6 = m(1) + b \\implies b = 6 - m\n   \\]\n\n8. **Substituting \\(b\\)**:\n   Substitute \\(b = 6 - m\\) into the discriminant equation:\n   \\[\n   (6 - m)^2 = 4(6 - m) + 40\n   \\]\n   Expanding gives:\n   \\[\n   (6 - m)^2 = 64 - 4m\n   \\]\n\n9. **Solving for \\(m\\)**:\n   Expanding the left side leads to:\n   \\[\n   36 - 12m + m^2 = 64 - 4m\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   m^2 - 8m - 28 = 0\n   \\]\n   Factoring or using the quadratic formula yields:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{(8)^2 + 4 \\cdot 28}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm 12}{2}\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\(m\\) can be \\(10\\) or \\(-2\\).\n\n10. **Finding \\(b\\)**:\n   For \\(m = 10\\):\n   \\[\n   b = 6 - 10 = -4\n   \\]\n   For \\(m = -2\\):\n   \\[\n   b = 6 - (-2) = 8\n   \\]\n   Both cases give \\(b \\neq 0\\), so we can take either \\( (m, b) = (10, -4) \\) or \\( (m, b) = (-2, 8) \\).\n\n11. **Final Line Equation**:\n   Choosing \\((m, b) = (10, -4)\\), the equation of the line is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{y = 10x - 4}\n   \\]",
  "ground_truth": "The line $x=k$ intersects $y=x^2+6x+5$ at the point $(k, k^2+6k+5)$ and the line $y=mx+b$ at the point $(k,mk+b)$. Since these two points have the same $x$-coordinate, the distance between them is the difference of their $y$-coordinates, so we have $$|(k^2+6k+5)-(mk+b)|=5.$$ Simplifying, this gives us two quadratic equations: $k^2+(6-m)k+5-b=5$ and $k^2+(6-m)k+5-b=-5$. We can express these as  \\begin{align*}\nk^2+(6-m)k-b=0&\\quad(1)\\\\\nk^2+(6-m)k+10-b=0.&\\quad(2)\n\\end{align*} We know that all solutions to both of these equations will be places where the line $y=mx+b$ is a vertical distance of $5$ from the parabola, but we know there can only be one such solution! Thus there must be exactly $1$ solution to one of the equations, and no solutions to the other equation. We find the discriminants ($b^2-4ac$) of the equations, so for equation $(1)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(-b)=(6-m)^2+4b$. For equation $(2)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(10-b)=(6-m)^2+4b-40$. One of these equations must equal zero, and one must be less than zero. Since $-40<0$, adding $(6-m)^2+4b$ to both sides doesn't change the inequality and $(6-m)^2+4b-40<(6-m)^2+4b$, so the greater value must be equal to zero so that the lesser value is always less than zero. Thus we have $(6-m)^2+4b=0$.\n\nWe are also given that the line $y=mx+b$ passes through the point $(1,6)$, so substituting $x=1$ and $y=6$ gives $6=(1)m+b$ or $m+b=6$. This means that $6-m=b$, so we can substitute in the above equation: \\begin{align*}\n(6-m)^2+4b&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(b)^2+4b&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nb(b+4)&=0.\n\\end{align*} We are given that $b\\neq 0$, so the only solution is $b=-4$. When we plug this into the equation $m+b=6$, we find $m-4=6$ so $m=10$. Thus the equation of the line is $y=mx+b$ or $\\boxed{y=10x-4}$."
