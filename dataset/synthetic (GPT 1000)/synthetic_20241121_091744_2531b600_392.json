  "problem": "A circle has an area of $M\\text{ cm}^2$ and a circumference of $N\\text{ cm}$. If $\\dfrac{M}{N}=20$, what is the radius of the circle, in cm?",
  "solution": "To determine the radius of a circle where the ratio of its area \\(M\\) to its circumference \\(N\\) is given as \\(\\frac{M}{N} = 20\\), we can utilize the formulas for the area and circumference of a circle.\n\n1. **Formulas**:\n   - The area \\(M\\) of a circle can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     M = \\pi r^2\n     \\]\n   - The circumference \\(N\\) of the same circle is given by:\n     \\[\n     N = 2\\pi r\n     \\]\n\n2. **Formulating the ratio**:\n   By substituting these formulas into the ratio, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{2\\pi r}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this expression yields:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{r^2}{2r} = \\frac{r}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Establishing the equation**:\n   According to the problem, this ratio equals \\(20\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{r}{2} = 20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the radius**:\n   To solve for \\(r\\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \\(2\\):\n   \\[\n   r = 20 \\times 2 = 40\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Therefore, the radius of the circle is \\(40\\) cm.\n\nIn summary, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>40</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Suppose the radius of the circle is $r$ cm.\n\nThen the area $M$ is $\\pi r^2\\text{ cm}^2$ and the circumference $N$ is $2\\pi r\\text{ cm}$.\n\nThus, $\\frac{\\pi r^2}{2\\pi r} = 20$ or $\\frac{r}{2}=20$ or $r=\\boxed{40}$."
