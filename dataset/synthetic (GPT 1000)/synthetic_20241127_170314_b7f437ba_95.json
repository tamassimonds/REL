We'll walk through the thought process naturally, highlighting brainstorming, reflections, and alternative approaches.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the sum of all real values of \\( x \\) that satisfy:\n\n\\[\nx = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 - x^5 + \\dotsb\n\\]\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nLooking at this equation, it resembles an infinite series with alternating signs and increasing powers of \\( x \\). My initial instinct is to treat it like a geometric series, but the alternating signs suggest it might be more complex. Perhaps recognizing it as a known series or using geometric series formulas could help. However, I'm not entirely sure yet, so I'll explore different strategies to see which one fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Geometric Series Approach**  \n   Treat the series as an infinite geometric series with alternating signs.\n\n2. **Recognizing a Known Series**  \n   Identify if the series matches a known Taylor expansion.\n\n3. **Differential Equation Approach**  \n   Consider if the series satisfies a particular differential equation.\n\n4. **Algebraic Manipulation**  \n   Attempt to manipulate the equation to express \\( x \\) in a solvable form.\n\n5. **Testing Specific Values of \\( x \\)**  \n   Plug in specific values like \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( x = 1 \\) to gain insights.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nStarting with the **Geometric Series Approach** seems most straightforward. If it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll move on to the next strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Geometric Series Approach**\n\n**Initial Idea:**  \nThe series is:\n\n\\[\nS = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 - x^5 + \\dotsb\n\\]\n\nThis resembles an infinite geometric series with the first term \\( a = 1 \\) and common ratio \\( r = -x \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nFor a geometric series to converge, the absolute value of the common ratio must be less than 1 (\\(|r| < 1\\)), so \\(|x| < 1\\) in this case.\n\n**Calculation:**  \nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{a}{1 - r} = \\frac{1}{1 - (-x)} = \\frac{1}{1 + x}\n\\]\n\n**Substitution:**  \nSubstitute back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nx = S = \\frac{1}{1 + x}\n\\]\n\n**Solving the Equation:**  \nMultiply both sides by \\(1 + x\\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\nx(1 + x) = 1 \\implies x^2 + x - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Quadratic Solutions:**  \nSolving the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two real solutions:\n\n\\[\nx_1 = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx 0.618,\\quad x_2 = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx -1.618\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute. The geometric series approach assumes \\(|x| < 1\\) for convergence. But \\(x_2 \\approx -1.618\\) falls outside this interval, meaning the series doesn\u2019t converge for \\(x_2\\). This suggests that only \\(x_1\\) is a valid solution where the series converges.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOnly \\(x_1 = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\) is valid. Therefore, the sum of all real values of \\(x\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Verification and Reflection**\n\n**First Thoughts Recap:**  \nInitially, I considered both solutions from the quadratic equation. However, realizing that the series only converges for \\(|x| < 1\\), only \\(x_1\\) is valid.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nAdding \\(x_1 + x_2 = -1\\), but since \\(x_2\\) lies outside the convergence interval, it doesn't satisfy the original infinite series equation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe sum of all real values of \\(x\\) that satisfy the equation is \\(x_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}\\).\n\n**Verification:**  \nTo verify, substitute \\(x_1\\) back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\nx_1 = 1 - x_1 + x_1^2 - x_1^3 + \\dotsb\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(|x_1| < 1\\), the series converges, and both sides of the equation are equal.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEnsuring convergence conditions are met was crucial. Initially, both solutions seemed valid, but understanding the convergence limitations refined the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approaches**\n\nWhile the **Geometric Series Approach** led to the solution, exploring other methods can reinforce correctness or provide additional insights.\n\n1. **Testing Specific Values of \\( x \\)**\n\n   - **Thought Process:** Let\u2019s plug in specific values like \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( x = 1 \\) to verify potential solutions.\n   \n   - **Test \\( x = 0 \\):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{LHS: } 0,\\quad \\text{RHS: } 1 - 0 + 0^2 - 0^3 + \\dotsb = 1\n     \\]\n     - **Conclusion:** \\( x = 0 \\) does not satisfy the equation.\n   \n   - **Test \\( x = 1 \\):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{LHS: } 1,\\quad \\text{RHS: } 1 - 1 + 1^2 - 1^3 + \\dotsb = 0\n     \\]\n     - **Conclusion:** \\( x = 1 \\) does not satisfy the equation either.\n   \n   - **Reflection:** Specific values don\u2019t yield solutions, reinforcing that the solution lies in the derived quadratic equation.\n\n2. **Recognizing a Known Series**\n\n   - **Thought Process:** The series resembles the expansion of \\(\\frac{1}{1 + x}\\), which converges for \\(|x| < 1\\). This aligns with the geometric series approach, confirming the validity of \\( x_1 \\).\n\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation**\n\n   - **Thought Process:** Attempting to rearrange the original equation to isolate terms involving \\( x \\). However, given the infinite nature of the series, direct manipulation seems impractical without assuming convergence.\n   \n   - **Reflection:** This approach doesn\u2019t offer new insights beyond what the geometric series provides.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Verification**\n\n**Recalling the Geometric Series Result:**  \nThe sum of the infinite series is \\(\\frac{1}{1 + x}\\), leading to the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{1 + x}\n\\]\n\n**Solving Again:**  \nMultiply both sides by \\(1 + x\\):\n\n\\[\nx(1 + x) = 1 \\implies x^2 + x - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Quadratic Solutions:**  \nSolving the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nx_1 = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2},\\quad x_2 = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Convergence Check:**  \nSince \\(|x| < 1\\) is required for convergence, only \\( x_1 \\approx 0.618 \\) satisfies this condition.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nTherefore, the sum of all real values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThrough exploring multiple strategies, primarily the **Geometric Series Approach**, and verifying convergence conditions, we deduced that only \\( x_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \\) satisfies the infinite series equation. Testing specific values and considering alternative methods reinforced the correctness of this solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}\\)\n\n---\n\n**Reflection and Verification:**  \nBy carefully examining the convergence criteria and testing alternative strategies, we ensured that only the valid solution contributed to the final answer. This thorough approach confirms the correctness of the solution and enhances confidence in its validity.",
  "ground_truth": "From the formula for an infinite geometric series,\n\\[1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \\dotsb = \\frac{1}{1 + x}.\\]Thus, we want to solve\n\\[x = \\frac{1}{1 + x}.\\]This simplifies to $x^2 + x - 1 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula,\n\\[x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}.\\]The infinite geometric series\n\\[1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \\dotsb\\]converges only for $|x| < 1,$ so the only solution in $x$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}}.$"
