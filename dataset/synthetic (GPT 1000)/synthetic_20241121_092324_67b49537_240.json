  "problem": "A certain organization consists of five leaders and some number of regular members. Every year, the current leaders are kicked out of the organization. Next, each regular member must find two new people to join as regular members. Finally, five new people are elected from outside the organization to become leaders. In the beginning, there are fifteen people in the organization total. How many people total will be in the organization five years from now?",
  "solution": "To determine the growth of the organization over five years, we will outline the process clearly, step by step.\n\n### Initial Conditions:\n- **Year 0:**\n  - Total members = 15\n  - Leaders = 5\n  - Regular members = 15 - 5 = 10\n\n### Annual Process:\n1. **Remove Leaders:** Each year, the 5 leaders are removed.\n2. **Recruitment by Regular Members:** Each regular member recruits 2 new members.\n3. **New Leaders Elected:** 5 new leaders are appointed from outside the organization.\n\n### Yearly Breakdown:\n\n#### Year 1:\n- **Start with:** 10 regular members.\n- **Recruitment:** \n  \\[\n  10 \\times 2 = 20 \\text{ new members}\n  \\]\n- **Total regular members after recruitment:** \n  \\[\n  10 + 20 = 30\n  \\]\n- **New leaders added:** 5 \n- **Total for Year 1:** \n  \\[\n  30 + 5 = 35\n  \\]\n\n#### Year 2:\n- **Start with:** 30 regular members.\n- **Recruitment:** \n  \\[\n  30 \\times 2 = 60 \\text{ new members}\n  \\]\n- **Total regular members after recruitment:** \n  \\[\n  30 + 60 = 90\n  \\]\n- **New leaders added:** 5 \n- **Total for Year 2:** \n  \\[\n  90 + 5 = 95\n  \\]\n\n#### Year 3:\n- **Start with:** 90 regular members.\n- **Recruitment:** \n  \\[\n  90 \\times 2 = 180 \\text{ new members}\n  \\]\n- **Total regular members after recruitment:** \n  \\[\n  90 + 180 = 270\n  \\]\n- **New leaders added:** 5 \n- **Total for Year 3:** \n  \\[\n  270 + 5 = 275\n  \\]\n\n#### Year 4:\n- **Start with:** 270 regular members.\n- **Recruitment:** \n  \\[\n  270 \\times 2 = 540 \\text{ new members}\n  \\]\n- **Total regular members after recruitment:** \n  \\[\n  270 + 540 = 810\n  \\]\n- **New leaders added:** 5 \n- **Total for Year 4:** \n  \\[\n  810 + 5 = 815\n  \\]\n\n#### Year 5:\n- **Start with:** 810 regular members.\n- **Recruitment:** \n  \\[\n  810 \\times 2 = 1620 \\text{ new members}\n  \\]\n- **Total regular members after recruitment:** \n  \\[\n  810 + 1620 = 2430\n  \\]\n- **New leaders added:** 5 \n- **Total for Year 5:** \n  \\[\n  2430 + 5 = 2435\n  \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter five years, the organization will have a total of **2435** members.",
  "ground_truth": "Let $a_k$ denote the number of people in year $k$ (with initially $k=0$). One might notice that after the leaders are kicked out, there are $a_k-5$ regular members. Then, there are $3(a_k-5)$ regular members after the new regular members join. Finally, after the new leaders are elected, we have a grand total of $3(a_k-5)+5 = 3a_k-10$ people the next year. One might wish to solve this recursion with $a_0=15$. But there is an easier way.\n\nNotice that the number of leaders stays the same each year, and the number of regular members triples. Thus the number of regular members follows a geometric sequence. In the beginning, there are $15-5=10$ regular members. Therefore, five years later, there will be $(3^5)(10)=2430$ regular members. The total number of people will be $5+2430=\\boxed{2435}$."
