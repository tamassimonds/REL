  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just like we'd tackle it on paper. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking each step along the way, and making adjustments as needed. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **First Impressions: Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Question:**  \n  Find \\(2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\).\n\n- **Initial Thoughts:**  \n  - This involves modular arithmetic and inverses.  \n  - I recall that finding a modular inverse means looking for a number that, when multiplied by the original, yields 1 modulo some number.  \n  - Hmm, dealing with inverses can be tricky... Maybe there's a direct way or some properties of modular arithmetic we can exploit.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**  \n  1. **Compute the Inverses Directly:** Find \\(5^{-1}\\) and \\(11^{-1}\\) modulo 56, then perform the multiplications and addition.  \n  2. **Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:** A reliable method for finding modular inverses.  \n  3. **Simplify the Expression First:** See if the expression can be simplified before finding inverses.  \n  4. **Alternative Modular Techniques:** Perhaps breaking down the modulus (since 56 = 8 \u00d7 7) could help.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  - **Strategy 1** seems straightforward, but computing inverses manually might be tedious.  \n  - **Strategy 2** is more systematic and likely safer.  \n  - **Strategy 3** could save time if simplification is possible, but not sure yet.  \n  - **Strategy 4** might complicate things unless absolutely necessary.\n\n- **Decision:**  \n  I'll start with **Strategy 1**\u2014computing the inverses directly. If it becomes too cumbersome, I'll switch to **Strategy 2** using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Let's see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Compute \\(5^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- I need to find an integer \\(x\\) such that \\(5x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}\\).  \n- This is a classic modular inverse problem.\n\n**Approach:**  \n- I'll use the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA)** to find \\(x\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Apply Euclidean Algorithm to 56 and 5:**  \n   \\[\n   56 = 5 \\times 11 + 1  \n   \\]  \n   \u2192 **Remainder is 1**, which is exactly what we need! This means \\(5\\) and \\(56\\) are coprime, so an inverse exists.\n\n2. **Back-substitution to Find Inverse:**  \n   From the equation:  \n   \\[\n   1 = 56 - 5 \\times 11  \n   \\]  \n   So,  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times (-11) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}  \n   \\]  \n   Therefore,  \n   \\[\n   5^{-1} \\equiv -11 \\pmod{56}  \n   \\]  \n   But we prefer positive representatives, so add 56:  \n   \\[\n   -11 + 56 = 45  \n   \\]  \n   Thus,  \n   \\[\n   5^{-1} \\equiv 45 \\pmod{56}  \n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Quick Check:**  \n  \\[\n  5 \\times 45 = 225  \n  \\]  \n  And,  \n  \\[\n  225 \\div 56 = 4 \\text{ remainder } 1  \n  \\]  \n  So,  \n  \\[\n  225 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}  \n  \\]  \n  **Correct!** The inverse is indeed 45.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- \\(5^{-1} \\equiv 45 \\pmod{56}\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Compute \\(11^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Now, I need to find \\(x\\) such that \\(11x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}\\).  \n- Again, this is another modular inverse problem.\n\n**Approach:**  \n- I'll use the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm** once more.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Apply Euclidean Algorithm to 56 and 11:**  \n   \\[\n   56 = 11 \\times 5 + 1  \n   \\]  \n   \u2192 **Remainder is 1**, perfect! This confirms that \\(11\\) and \\(56\\) are coprime, so an inverse exists.\n\n2. **Back-substitution to Find Inverse:**  \n   From the equation:  \n   \\[\n   1 = 56 - 11 \\times 5  \n   \\]  \n   So,  \n   \\[\n   11 \\times (-5) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}  \n   \\]  \n   Therefore,  \n   \\[\n   11^{-1} \\equiv -5 \\pmod{56}  \n   \\]  \n   Adding 56 to make it positive:  \n   \\[\n   -5 + 56 = 51  \n   \\]  \n   Thus,  \n   \\[\n   11^{-1} \\equiv 51 \\pmod{56}  \n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Quick Check:**  \n  \\[\n  11 \\times 51 = 561  \n  \\]  \n  And,  \n  \\[\n  561 \\div 56 = 10 \\text{ remainder } 1  \n  \\]  \n  So,  \n  \\[\n  561 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}  \n  \\]  \n  **Correct!** The inverse is 51.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- \\(11^{-1} \\equiv 51 \\pmod{56}\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Substitute Inverses Back into the Original Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Now that I have the inverses, I can plug them back into the original expression:  \n  \\[\n  2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}  \n  \\]  \n  Which becomes:  \n  \\[\n  2 \\cdot 45 + 8 \\cdot 51 \\pmod{56}  \n  \\]\n\n**Approach:**  \n- I'll perform the multiplications first, then add the results, and finally reduce modulo 56.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Compute \\(2 \\cdot 45\\):**  \n   \\[\n   2 \\times 45 = 90  \n   \\]\n\n2. **Compute \\(8 \\cdot 51\\):**  \n   \\[\n   8 \\times 51 = 408  \n   \\]\n\n3. **Add the Two Products:**  \n   \\[\n   90 + 408 = 498  \n   \\]\n\n4. **Reduce Modulo 56:**  \n   \\[\n   498 \\div 56 = 8 \\text{ remainder } 50  \n   \\]  \n   So,  \n   \\[\n   498 \\equiv 50 \\pmod{56}  \n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Quick Check:**  \n  \\[\n  498 - (56 \\times 8) = 498 - 448 = 50  \n  \\]  \n  **Correct!** The remainder is 50, so the final result makes sense.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The final answer is  \n  \\[\n  \\boxed{50}  \n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- It's always good to double-check the work to ensure no mistakes were made. Maybe there's another way to verify the answer or approach the problem differently for confirmation.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \n- **Strategy 3:** Simplify the Expression Before Computing Inverses.\n\n**Exploration:**  \n- **Simplifying Before Inverses:**  \n  - Look at the original expression:  \n    \\[\n    2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}  \n    \\]  \n  - Notice that 2 and 8 are multiples of 2, and 56 is also even.  \n  - Perhaps factoring out common terms could help, but...  \n  - Actually, factoring doesn't seem to simplify things significantly here.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  - **Realization:** Strategy 3 doesn't provide much advantage in this case. It's better to stick with the original approach of computing inverses directly.\n\n**Verification:**  \n- Since the original approach was straightforward and all checks confirmed correctness, the solution is reliable.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**  \n- The final answer remains  \n  \\[\n  \\boxed{50}  \n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{50}  \n\\]\n\n**Process Recap:**  \n- **Step 1:** Computed \\(5^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\) and found it to be 45.  \n- **Step 2:** Computed \\(11^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\) and found it to be 51.  \n- **Step 3:** Substituted these inverses back into the original expression, performed the calculations, and reduced the result modulo 56 to obtain the final answer: 50.  \n- **Step 4:** Verified the solution by checking each step and considering alternative strategies.\n\n**Outcome:**  \n- The approach was systematic, and each step was validated to ensure correctness. The final answer is 50, confirmed through multiple checks.",
  "ground_truth": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 2, 5, 8, and 11 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 25 + \\frac{8}{11} \\equiv \\frac{2 \\cdot 11 + 8 \\cdot 5}{55} \\equiv \\frac{62}{-1} \\equiv -62 \\equiv \\boxed{50} \\pmod{56}.$$Indeed, we can justify this manipulation as follows. Suppose that $n \\equiv 2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}$; then multiplying both sides of the congruence by $55$ (which is relatively prime with $56$) yields that $-n \\equiv 55n \\equiv 22 + 40 \\equiv 62 \\pmod{56}$."
