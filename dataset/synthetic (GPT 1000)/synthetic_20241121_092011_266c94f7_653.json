  "problem": "The degree measures of the angles in a convex 18-sided polygon form an increasing arithmetic sequence with integer values. Find the degree measure of the smallest angle.\n",
  "solution": "To find the smallest angle in a convex 18-sided polygon where the angles form an increasing arithmetic sequence, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sum of Interior Angles**:  \n   The sum of the interior angles \\( S \\) of an \\( n \\)-sided polygon is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   S = (n - 2) \\times 180\n   \\]\n   For an 18-sided polygon:\n   \\[\n   S = (18 - 2) \\times 180 = 16 \\times 180 = 2880 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Define the Angles**:  \n   Let the smallest angle be \\( a \\) and the common difference of the arithmetic sequence be \\( d \\). The angles can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   a, a + d, a + 2d, \\ldots, a + 17d\n   \\]\n   This leads to a total sum:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = 18a + (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 17)d = 18a + 153d\n   \\]\n   (where \\( 153 = \\frac{17 \\times 18}{2} \\)).\n\n3. **Establish the Equation**:  \n   We set the sum equal to the total interior angle sum:\n   \\[\n   18a + 153d = 2880.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Equation**:  \n   Dividing through by 3, we have:\n   \\[\n   6a + 51d = 960,\n   \\]\n   which can be rearranged to:\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{960 - 51d}{6}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Constraints on \\( a \\)**:  \n   For \\( a \\) to be a positive integer, \\( 960 - 51d \\) must be positive and divisible by 6:\n   \\[\n   960 - 51d > 0 \\implies d < \\frac{960}{51} \\approx 18.82.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( d \\) must be an even integer, the possible values for \\( d \\) are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.\n\n6. **Calculate \\( a \\) Values**:  \n   We will calculate \\( a \\) for each even \\( d \\):\n   - **\\( d = 2 \\)**: \\( a = 143 \\)\n   - **\\( d = 4 \\)**: \\( a = 126 \\) (not valid)\n   - **\\( d = 6 \\)**: \\( a = 109 \\) (not valid)\n   - **\\( d = 8 \\)**: \\( a = 92 \\) (not valid)\n   - **\\( d = 10 \\)**: \\( a = 75 \\) (not valid)\n   - **\\( d = 12 \\)**: \\( a = 58 \\) (not valid)\n   - **\\( d = 14 \\)**: \\( a = 41 \\) (not valid)\n   - **\\( d = 16 \\)**: \\( a = 24 \\) (not valid)\n   - **\\( d = 18 \\)**: \\( a = 7 \\) (not valid)\n\n7. **Valid Angle Check**:  \n   We need to ensure that the largest angle \\( a + 17d < 180 \\) degrees:\n   - For \\( d = 2\\): Maximum angle = \\( 143 + 34 = 177 \\) (valid)\n   - For all other \\( d \\) values, the maximum angle exceeds 180 (invalid).\n\nTherefore, the only feasible solution occurs when \\( d = 2\\), leading to the smallest angle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Smallest angle } a = 143.\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>143 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The average angle in an 18-gon is $160^\\circ$. In an arithmetic sequence the average is the same as the median, so the middle two terms of the sequence average to $160^\\circ$. Thus for some positive (the sequence is increasing and thus non-constant) integer $d$, the middle two terms are $(160-d)^\\circ$ and $(160+d)^\\circ$. Since the step is $2d$ the last term of the sequence is $(160 + 17d)^\\circ$, which must be less than $180^\\circ$, since the polygon is convex. This gives $17d < 20$, so the only suitable positive integer $d$ is 1. The first term is then $(160-17)^\\circ = \\boxed{143}.$"
