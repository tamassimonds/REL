  "problem": "Let $g(x) = x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1.$  What is the remainder when the polynomial $g(x^{12})$ is divided by the polynomial $g(x)$?",
  "solution": "To find the remainder when \\( g(x^{12}) \\) is divided by \\( g(x) \\), we begin with the polynomial \\( g(x) \\):\n\n1. **Definition of \\( g(x) \\)**:\n   The polynomial is given by:\n   \\[\n   g(x) = x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1.\n   \\]\n   This can be recognized as a geometric series summing the powers from \\( x^0 \\) to \\( x^5 \\).\n\n2. **Roots of \\( g(x) \\)**:\n   The roots of \\( g(x) \\) are the sixth roots of unity, excluding \\( x = 1 \\). Specifically, if we let \\( \\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 6} \\) be a primitive sixth root of unity, the roots are \\( \\omega, \\omega^2, \\omega^3, \\omega^4, \\) and \\( \\omega^5 \\).\n\n3. **Evaluating \\( g(x^{12}) \\)**:\n   We compute:\n   \\[\n   g(x^{12}) = (x^{12})^5 + (x^{12})^4 + (x^{12})^3 + (x^{12})^2 + x^{12} + 1 = x^{60} + x^{48} + x^{36} + x^{24} + x^{12} + 1.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding the remainder**:\n   By the polynomial remainder theorem, since \\( g(x) \\) is of degree 5, the remainder \\( r(x) \\) when dividing \\( g(x^{12}) \\) by \\( g(x) \\) will be of degree less than 5. We express it as:\n   \\[\n   r(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e,\n   \\]\n   where \\( a, b, c, d, e \\) are constants to be determined.\n\n5. **Using the roots to evaluate the remainder**:\n   We substitute each root \\( \\omega^k \\) (for \\( k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\)) into \\( g(x) \\). Since \\( g(\\omega^k) = 0 \\), it follows that:\n   \\[\n   r(\\omega^k) = g((\\omega^k)^{12}) = g(\\omega^{12k}) = g(1) = 6.\n   \\]\n   This shows \\( r(\\omega^k) = 6 \\) for each \\( k \\).\n\n6. **Establishing a system of equations**:\n   Since \\( r(\\omega^k) = 6 \\) holds for all roots, we conclude that:\n   \\[\n   r(x) - 6 = 0 \\text{ at roots } \\omega, \\omega^2, \\omega^3, \\omega^4, \\omega^5.\n   \\]\n   This means \\( r(x) - 6 \\) has these five roots, suggesting:\n   \\[\n   r(x) - 6 = c \\cdot g(x)\n   \\]\n   for some constant \\( c \\).\n\n7. **Determining \\( c \\)**:\n   Given that \\( r(x) \\) must have a degree less than 5 and must equal 6 everywhere (i.e., a constant), we find \\( c = 0 \\). Therefore, we conclude:\n   \\[\n   r(x) = 6.\n   \\]\n\n8. **Final result**:\n   Thus, the remainder when \\( g(x^{12}) \\) is divided by \\( g(x) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{6}.\n   \\]",
  "ground_truth": "We have that\n\\[g(x^{12}) = x^{60} + x^{48} + x^{36} + x^{24} + x^{12} + 1.\\]Note that\n\\[(x - 1)g(x) = (x - 1)(x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) = x^6 - 1.\\]Also,\n\\begin{align*}\ng(x^{12}) - 6 &= (x^{60} + x^{48} + x^{36} + x^{24} + x^{12} + 1) - 6 \\\\\n&= (x^{60} - 1) + (x^{48} - 1) + (x^{36} - 1) + (x^{24} - 1) + (x^{12} - 1).\n\\end{align*}We can write\n\\[(x^{60} - 1) = (x^6 - 1)(x^{54} + x^{48} + x^{42} + \\dots + x^6 + 1).\\]In the same way, $x^{48} - 1,$ $x^{36} - 1,$ $x^{24} - 1,$ and $x^{12} - 1$ are all multiples of $x^6 - 1,$ so they are multiples of $g(x).$\n\nWe have shown that $g(x^{12}) - 6$ is a multiple of $g(x),$ so the remainder when the polynomial $g(x^{12})$ is divided by the polynomial $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{6}.$"
