  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking it through just like I would if I were encountering it for the first time. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **We have a trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) with specific properties:**\n  - Leg \\(\\overline{BC}\\) is **perpendicular** to bases \\(\\overline{AB}\\) and \\(\\overline{CD}\\).\n  - Diagonals \\(\\overline{AC}\\) and \\(\\overline{BD}\\) are **perpendicular**.\n  - Given lengths: \\(AB=\\sqrt{11}\\) and \\(AD=\\sqrt{1001}\\).\n  - **Goal:** Find \\(BC^2\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **This reminds me of problems involving trapezoids with right angles and perpendicular diagonals.**\n- **Thinking:** Right angles suggest the use of the Pythagorean theorem.\n- **Wait, but diagonals being perpendicular adds another layer\u2014maybe involving vector properties or coordinate geometry.**\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** Since there are right angles, this might help.\n2. **Coordinate Geometry:** Assign coordinates to each point and solve algebraically.\n3. **Vector Approach:** Consider using vectors to exploit the perpendicularity of the diagonals.\n\nGiven these options, I\u2019ll start with the **Pythagorean Theorem**, but remain open to switching strategies if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Visualizing the Trapezoid**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Let's try to visualize the trapezoid to better understand the relationships.**\n- **Given that \\(\\overline{BC}\\) is perpendicular to both bases, it looks like an **isosceles trapezoid**.**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Actually, since \\(\\overline{BC}\\) is perpendicular to both bases, \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) are parallel, making it a right-angled trapezoid.**\n- **This should make applying the Pythagorean theorem easier.**\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does this make sense? Yes, because having perpendicular legs and bases aligns with the properties of a right trapezoid.**\n\nProceeding with the Pythagorean theorem seems promising, so I'll continue with this approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to Triangle ABD**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Triangle \\(ABD\\) is right-angled at \\(B\\) since \\(\\overline{BC}\\) is perpendicular to \\(\\overline{AB}\\) and \\(\\overline{CD}\\).**\n- **We know \\(AB = \\sqrt{11}\\) and \\(AD = \\sqrt{1001}\\).**\n- **Can we find \\(BD\\) using the Pythagorean theorem?**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nBD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 = (\\sqrt{11})^2 + (\\sqrt{1001})^2 = 11 + 1001 = 1012\n\\]\n\\[\nBD = \\sqrt{1012}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Finding \\(BD\\) is straightforward, but does this help us find \\(BC^2\\) directly?**\n- **Not yet. We need more information.**\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does finding \\(BD\\) help?**\n- **Not immediately, but it's good to have it in case it's needed later.**\n\nAt this point, I realize that just knowing \\(BD\\) isn't enough. Time to consider another strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering the Perpendicular Diagonals**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Given that diagonals \\(\\overline{AC}\\) and \\(\\overline{BD}\\) are perpendicular, maybe we can use properties of quadrilaterals with perpendicular diagonals.**\n- **This reminds me of using area formulas or vector properties.**\n\n**Brainstorming Again:**\n\n- **Perhaps assigning coordinates to each point could help visualize and set up equations.**\n- **Alternatively, using vectors to represent the diagonals and exploiting their perpendicularity could lead to a solution.**\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll **explore coordinate geometry** next.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Assigning Coordinates to Points**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Let's assign coordinates to make the problem more concrete.**\n- **Assume \\(A\\) is at the origin: \\(A(0, 0)\\).**\n- **Since \\(AB = \\sqrt{11}\\), let's place \\(B\\) at \\((\\sqrt{11}, 0)\\).**\n- **Point \\(C\\) is directly above \\(B\\) since \\(\\overline{BC}\\) is perpendicular to \\(\\overline{AB}\\), so \\(C(\\sqrt{11}, h)\\) where \\(h = BC\\).**\n- **Point \\(D\\) should be at \\((0, k)\\) since \\(AD = \\sqrt{1001}\\).**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **But wait\u2014if \\(D\\) is at \\((0, k)\\), then \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) being perpendicular might not align easily.**\n- **Maybe I need to adjust the coordinates.**\n\n**Adjusting Coordinates:**\n\n- **Let's see\u2014alternatively, place \\(A\\) at \\((0, 0)\\), \\(B\\) at \\((\\sqrt{11}, 0)\\), \\(C\\) at \\((\\sqrt{11}, h)\\), and \\(D\\) at \\((x, y)\\) such that \\(AD = \\sqrt{1001}\\).**\n- **But this complicates things.**\n\n**Realizing a Better Approach:**\n\n- **Actually, assigning coordinates is getting messy.**\n- **Perhaps using vectors is a cleaner approach.**\n\nGiven this realization, I\u2019ll **shift to a vector approach**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Using Vectors to Exploit Perpendicular Diagonals**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Let's represent the diagonals as vectors and use their perpendicularity to set up equations.**\n- **Vector \\(\\overrightarrow{AC}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{BD}\\) are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero.**\n\n**Setting Up the Vectors:**\n\n- **Assigning points:**\n  - \\(A = (0, 0)\\)\n  - \\(B = (\\sqrt{11}, 0)\\)\n  - \\(C = (\\sqrt{11}, h)\\) where \\(h = BC\\)\n  - \\(D = (x, y)\\) such that \\(AD = \\sqrt{1001}\\)\n\n**Calculating Vectors:**\n\n- \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} = (\\sqrt{11}, h)\\)\n- \\(\\overrightarrow{BD} = (x - \\sqrt{11}, y)\\)\n\n**Dot Product Condition:**\n\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{AC} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BD} = 0 \\implies (\\sqrt{11})(x - \\sqrt{11}) + h(y) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **This gives us a relationship between \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(h\\).**\n- **But we need more equations to solve for these variables.**\n\n**Thinking:**\n\n- **We have another condition: \\(AD = \\sqrt{1001}\\).**\n- **We can use this to find \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).**\n\nThis approach seems to be leading somewhere, so I'll continue.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to Find \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Since \\(AD = \\sqrt{1001}\\) and points \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) are \\((0, 0)\\) and \\((x, y)\\), respectively:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 = 1001\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Now we have two equations:**\n  1. \\((\\sqrt{11})(x - \\sqrt{11}) + h(y) = 0\\)\n  2. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1001\\)  \n- **But we still need another equation to connect \\(h\\) and \\(y\\).**\n\n**Realizing the Need for Another Equation:**\n\n- **Hmm, maybe using the fact that \\(\\overline{BC}\\) is perpendicular to both bases can help.**\n- **Wait, actually, since \\(BC\\) is vertical and perpendicular to \\(AB\\), \\(y = h\\).**\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Is this correct? Yes, because \\(\\overline{BC}\\) is vertical, so the height \\(h\\) is the same as \\(y\\).**\n\nThis insight simplifies the problem significantly. Let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Simplifying the Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Now we can substitute \\(y = h\\) into the equations.**\n- **Equation 1 becomes:**\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{11})(x - \\sqrt{11}) + h^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n- **Equation 2 remains:**\n\n\\[\nx^2 + h^2 = 1001\n\\]\n\n**Solving Equation 1 for \\(x\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{11}x - 11 + h^2 = 0 \\implies \\sqrt{11}x + h^2 = 11 \\implies x = \\frac{11 - h^2}{\\sqrt{11}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **This expression for \\(x\\) can be substituted into Equation 2 to solve for \\(h\\).**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{11 - h^2}{\\sqrt{11}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{11 - h^2}{\\sqrt{11}}\\right)^2 + h^2 = 1001\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(11 - h^2)^2}{11} + h^2 = 1001\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **This looks like a quadratic equation in terms of \\(h^2\\).**\n- **Let's multiply both sides by 11 to eliminate the denominator.**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(11 - h^2)^2 + 11h^2 = 11011\n\\]\n\n**Expanding the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n121 - 22h^2 + h^4 + 11h^2 = 11011\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh^4 - 11h^2 + 121 = 11011\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh^4 - 11h^2 + 121 - 11011 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh^4 - 11h^2 - 10890 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **This is a quartic equation, which seems complicated to solve directly.**\n- **Maybe there's a simpler way or a substitution that can simplify it.**\n\n**Thinking:**\n\n- **Wait, perhaps substituting \\(k = h^2\\) can turn this into a quadratic equation.**\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Is this a valid substitution? Yes, because \\(k = h^2\\) makes the equation easier to handle.**\n\nThis substitution appears helpful. Let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Substituting \\(k = h^2\\) to Simplify the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Let \\(k = h^2\\), so the equation becomes:**\n\n\\[\nk^2 - 11k - 10890 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Now, it's a quadratic equation in terms of \\(k\\).**\n- **We can use the quadratic formula to solve for \\(k\\).**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Quadratic Formula:**  \n\\[\nk = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n- **Here, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -11\\), \\(c = -10890\\):**\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{(-11)^2 - 4(1)(-10890)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{121 + 43560}}{2} = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{43681}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{11 \\pm 209}{2}\n\\]\n\n- **Possible Solutions:**\n  - \\(k = \\frac{220}{2} = 110\\)\n  - \\(k = \\frac{-198}{2} = -99\\) (But since \\(k = h^2\\), this must be non-negative)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **So, \\(k = 110\\), which means \\(h^2 = 110\\).**\n- **This gives us \\(BC^2 = 110\\), which is what we were looking for.**\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?**\n- **Given the lengths provided and the properties of the trapezoid, \\(BC^2 = 110\\) seems reasonable.**\n- **Quick mental check:**\n  - \\(AB = \\sqrt{11} \\approx 3.32\\)\n  - \\(AD = \\sqrt{1001} \\approx 31.65\\)\n  - \\(BC^2 = 110 \\implies BC \\approx 10.49\\)\n  - **These dimensions fit well within a right-angled trapezoid.**\n\nEverything checks out, so I'll proceed to finalize the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Before finalizing, let's ensure all steps logically lead to the solution.**\n- **Revisiting the key steps:**\n  1. **Used Pythagorean theorem to find \\(BD\\).**\n  2. **Applied vector properties to set up equations based on the perpendicular diagonals.**\n  3. **Simplified equations to solve for \\(BC^2\\).**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **All steps are consistent and validate each other.**\n- **No contradictions or missing pieces.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Does the final answer satisfy all given conditions? Yes.**\n\nEverything aligns perfectly, confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\\[BC^2 = 110\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **By leveraging the perpendicular properties of the trapezoid's legs and diagonals, and systematically applying geometric and algebraic principles, we determined that \\(BC^2 = 110\\).**\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **This problem required exploring multiple strategies, starting with the Pythagorean theorem and evolving into a vector approach to fully utilize the trapezoid's properties.**\n- **Being flexible and willing to shift strategies was essential in reaching the correct solution.**\n- **Regular reflection and checks ensured the validity of each step, leading to a confident and correct conclusion.**\n\nAnd that's how I would tackle this problem, reflecting and adjusting my approach as needed to arrive at the correct solution.\n\n---",
