  "problem": "Billy and Bobbi each selected a positive integer less than 200. Billy's number is a multiple of 18, and Bobbi's number is a multiple of 24. What is the probability that they selected the same number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To determine the probability that Billy and Bobbi select the same number, we first need to identify the positive integers less than 200 that are multiples of 18 (for Billy) and multiples of 24 (for Bobbi). We will then find the common multiples of these two numbers and calculate the probability.\n\n**Step 1: Identifying Multiples of 18**\n\nThe multiples of 18 less than 200 are:\n\n- \\( 18 \\times 1 = 18 \\)\n- \\( 18 \\times 2 = 36 \\)\n- \\( 18 \\times 3 = 54 \\)\n- \\( 18 \\times 4 = 72 \\)\n- \\( 18 \\times 5 = 90 \\)\n- \\( 18 \\times 6 = 108 \\)\n- \\( 18 \\times 7 = 126 \\)\n- \\( 18 \\times 8 = 144 \\)\n- \\( 18 \\times 9 = 162 \\)\n- \\( 18 \\times 10 = 180 \\)\n- \\( 18 \\times 11 = 198 \\)\n\nThis gives us a total of 11 multiples of 18:\n\n\\[ 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, 108, 126, 144, 162, 180, 198 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Multiples of 24**\n\nThe multiples of 24 less than 200 are:\n\n- \\( 24 \\times 1 = 24 \\)\n- \\( 24 \\times 2 = 48 \\)\n- \\( 24 \\times 3 = 72 \\)\n- \\( 24 \\times 4 = 96 \\)\n- \\( 24 \\times 5 = 120 \\)\n- \\( 24 \\times 6 = 144 \\)\n- \\( 24 \\times 7 = 168 \\)\n- \\( 24 \\times 8 = 192 \\)\n\nThis results in 8 multiples of 24:\n\n\\[ 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Finding Common Multiples**\n\nTo find the common multiples of 18 and 24, we calculate their least common multiple (LCM). \n\nThe prime factorization is:\n- For 18: \\( 2^1 \\times 3^2 \\)\n- For 24: \\( 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\)\n\nThe LCM takes the highest power of each prime factor:\n\n- For 2: \\( \\max(1, 3) = 3 \\) (thus \\( 2^3 \\))\n- For 3: \\( \\max(2, 1) = 2 \\) (thus \\( 3^2 \\))\n\nThus, the LCM is:\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(18, 24) = 2^3 \\times 3^2 = 8 \\times 9 = 72 \\]\n\nNext, we find the multiples of 72 that are less than 200:\n\n- \\( 72 \\times 1 = 72 \\)\n- \\( 72 \\times 2 = 144 \\)\n\nThe common multiples less than 200 are:\n\n\\[ 72, 144 \\]\n\nThis results in 2 common multiples.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Probability**\n\nFor Billy, there are 11 possible outcomes (multiples of 18), and for Bobbi, there are 8 possible outcomes (multiples of 24). The total number of outcomes when both select a number is:\n\n\\[ 11 \\times 8 = 88 \\]\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes, where both select the same number (the common multiples), is 2. Therefore, the probability \\( P \\) that Billy and Bobbi select the same number is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{same number}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{2}{88} = \\frac{1}{44}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer for the probability that Billy and Bobbi select the same number is:\n\n<ANSWER>1/44</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We must first find how many positive integers less than 200 are multiples of both 18 and 24. $18=2\\cdot3^2$ and $24=2^3\\cdot3$, so the LCM of 18 and 24 is $2^3\\cdot3^2=72$. Therefore, an integer is a multiple of both 18 and 24 if and only if it is a multiple of 72.\n\nDividing 200 by 72 gives quotient 2 (and remainder 56), so there are 2 multiples of 72 less than 200.\n\nDividing 200 by 18 gives quotient 11 (and remainder 2), so there are 11 multiples of 18 less than 200.\n\nDividing 200 by 24 gives quotient 8 (and remainder 8), so there are 8 multiples of 24 less than 200.\n\nTherefore, Billy and Bobbi together can pick $11\\cdot8=88$ different two-number combinations, and 2 of these involve them choosing the same number (the two multiples of 72 are the possible duplicate numbers). Thus, the probability that they selected the same number is $2/88=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{44}}$."
