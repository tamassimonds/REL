  "problem": "The degree measure of the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n$ sides is 1800. What is the degree measure of the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides?",
  "solution": "To determine the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of sides of the polygon. \n\nGiven that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is 1800 degrees, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n(n - 2) \\times 180 = 1800\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( n \\):\n\n1. Divide both sides by 180:\n\n\\[\nn - 2 = \\frac{1800}{180}\n\\]\n\n2. Simplifying the right side gives:\n\n\\[\nn - 2 = 10\n\\]\n\n3. Adding 2 to both sides yields:\n\n\\[\nn = 12\n\\]\n\nNext, we want to find the sum of the interior angles for a convex polygon with \\( n + 2 \\) sides. Since we found \\( n = 12 \\), we calculate:\n\n\\[\nn + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14\n\\]\n\nNow, we apply the interior angle formula for a polygon with 14 sides:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = (14 - 2) \\times 180 = 12 \\times 180\n\\]\n\nCalculating this, we find:\n\n\\[\n12 \\times 180 = 2160\n\\]\n\nThus, the degree measure of the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with \\( n + 2 \\) sides (14 sides) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2160}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The sum of the measures of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180^\\circ(n-2)$.  Therefore,  \\[\n180(n-2)=1800 \\implies n=12.\n\\] So $n+2=14$, and the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a 14-gon is $180^\\circ(14-2)=\\boxed{2160}$ degrees."
