  "problem": "John has 12 marbles of different colors, including one red, one green, and one blue marble. In how many ways can he choose 4 marbles, if exactly one of the chosen marbles is red, green, or blue?",
  "solution": "To determine how many ways John can choose 4 marbles consisting of exactly one marble that is either red, green, or blue, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Problem Overview\nJohn has a total of 12 marbles, including 3 specific ones\u2014red, green, and blue. We want to select 4 marbles that include exactly one of these three colors.\n\n### Step 2: Selecting One Marble\nFirst, we need to select one marble from the red, green, or blue options:\n\n- **Number of ways to choose one marble from the three**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Ways to choose 1 marble} = \\binom{3}{1} = 3\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Selecting the Remaining Marbles\nAfter picking one marble from the colors mentioned, John must select 3 additional marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (since there are 12 in total and 3 are the specific colors):\n\n- **Number of ways to choose 3 marbles from the 9 remaining**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Ways to choose 3 from 9} = \\binom{9}{3}\n  \\]\n  Calculating \\(\\binom{9}{3}\\):\n  \\[\n  \\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{504}{6} = 84\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Combining the Choices\nNow, we find the total number of combinations by multiplying the number of ways to choose one colored marble by the ways to choose the other three marbles:\n\n- **Total combination of ways**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total ways} = \\text{Ways to choose 1 color marble} \\times \\text{Ways to choose 3 from 9} = 3 \\times 84 = 252\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the total number of ways John can choose 4 marbles with exactly one marble being red, green, or blue is:\n\\[\n\\text{Final Answer: } 252\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "There are 3 ways for John to decide which of the red, green, and blue marbles to choose. After he has chosen one of them, he must choose 3 marbles from the other 9. There are $\\binom{9}{3}=84$ ways for him to do this. The total number of valid ways for John to choose four marbles is $3\\cdot 84=\\boxed{252}$."
