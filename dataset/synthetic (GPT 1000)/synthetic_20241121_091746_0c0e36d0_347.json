  "problem": "A company that sells widgets has to pay $\\$500$ in maintenance fees each day and then it pays each worker $\\$15$ per hour. Each worker makes 5 widgets per hour, which are sold at $\\$3.10$ each. What is the least number of workers the company has to hire in order to make a profit in an 8-hour workday?",
  "solution": "To determine the minimum number of workers needed for the company to make a profit during an 8-hour workday, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Daily Fixed Costs**: The company incurs a maintenance fee of $500 each day.\n\n2. **Daily Wage per Worker**: Each worker earns $15 per hour for 8 hours of work, resulting in:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily wage per worker} = 15 \\times 8 = 120 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Daily Wage for `n` Workers**: For `n` workers, the total daily wage is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total daily wage} = n \\times 120 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Daily Costs**: The overall total costs when hiring `n` workers is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total costs} = 500 + 120n\n   \\]\n\n5. **Production by `n` Workers**: Each worker produces 5 widgets per hour, leading to a daily output of:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Widgets per worker} = 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\text{ widgets}\n   \\]\n   Thus, `n` workers produce:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total production by n workers} = n \\times 40 \\text{ widgets}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Revenue from Sales**: Each widget sells for $3.10, so the revenue from the widgets produced by `n` workers is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Revenue} = n \\times 40 \\times 3.10 = 124n \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Profit Calculation**: To achieve profit, the revenue must exceed the total costs:\n   \\[\n   124n > 500 + 120n\n   \\]\n\n8. **Solving the Inequality**: Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   4n > 500\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 4, we find:\n   \\[\n   n > 125\n   \\]\n\n9. **Minimum Workers Needed**: Since `n` must be a whole number, the company needs to hire at least:\n   \\[\n   n = 126\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the least number of workers the company has to hire to make a profit in an 8-hour workday is **126**. \n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>126</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We look for the least number of workers $n$ such that the cost is less than the revenue in a day of work. The cost of each worker is $\\$15$ per hour, while the revenue that comes from each worker hired is $\\$3.10\\times5$ widgets per hour. \\begin{align*}\n500+8(15n)&<(8)(3.1)(5)n=124n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n500+120n&<124n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n500&<4n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n125&<n.\n\\end{align*}The smallest integer greater than 125 is 126, so the company has to hire at least $\\boxed{126}$ workers to make a profit."
