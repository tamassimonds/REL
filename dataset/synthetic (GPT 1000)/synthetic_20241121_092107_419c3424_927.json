  "problem": "A line through the points $(2, -9)$ and $(j, 17)$ is parallel to the line $2x + 3y = 21$. What is the value of $j$?",
  "solution": "To find the value of \\(j\\) such that the line through the points \\((2, -9)\\) and \\((j, 17)\\) is parallel to the line represented by the equation \\(2x + 3y = 21\\), we need to first determine the slope of that line.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the slope of the line \\(2x + 3y = 21\\)**\n\nWe will rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form (\\(y = mx + b\\)), where \\(m\\) is the slope. Starting with the original equation:\n\n\\[\n2x + 3y = 21\n\\]\n\nWe solve for \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n3y = -2x + 21\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 7\n\\]\n\nFrom this, the slope (\\(m\\)) of the line is:\n\n\\[\nm = -\\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Find the slope of the line through the points \\((2, -9)\\) and \\((j, 17)\\)**\n\nThe slope between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n\\]\n\nFor our points \\((2, -9)\\) and \\((j, 17)\\):\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{17 - (-9)}{j - 2} = \\frac{17 + 9}{j - 2} = \\frac{26}{j - 2}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Set the slopes equal (since the lines are parallel)**\n\nSince the slopes must be equal for the lines to be parallel:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{26}{j - 2} = -\\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Cross-multiply to solve for \\(j\\)**\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n26 \\cdot 3 = -2 \\cdot (j - 2)\n\\]\n\\[\n78 = -2j + 4\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Rearrange the equation to solve for \\(j\\)**\n\nWe isolate \\(j\\) as follows:\n\n1. Subtract \\(4\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   78 - 4 = -2j\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   74 = -2j\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide by \\(-2\\):\n   \\[\n   j = -\\frac{74}{2} = -37\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\(j\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-37}\n\\]\n\nIn summary, the value of \\(j\\) that makes the two lines parallel is \\(-37\\).",
  "ground_truth": "The slope of the given line is $-\\frac23$, and the line through the points must have the same slope. This means that \\[\n\\frac{17-(-9)}{j-2}=-\\frac23\n\\] We can multiply out denominators to get $3(26)=-2(j-2)$, or $-39=j-2$ and $j=\\boxed{-37}$."
