  "problem": "For what values of $b$ is $-2$ not in the range of the function $f(x)=x^2+bx+2$? Express your answer in interval notation.",
  "solution": "To determine the values of \\( b \\) such that \\( -2 \\) is not in the range of the function \\( f(x) = x^2 + bx + 2 \\), we need to analyze the conditions under which the equation \\( f(x) = -2 \\) has no real solutions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Set up the equation**: We want to find when \n   \\[\n   f(x) = -2\n   \\]\n   This leads to:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + bx + 2 = -2.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rearranging the equation**: Rearranging gives us:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + bx + 4 = 0.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the discriminant**: The quadratic equation must not have real solutions for \\( -2 \\) to be outside the range of \\( f(x) \\). This means the discriminant \\( D \\) must be less than zero. The discriminant for a quadratic \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   D = b^2 - 4ac.\n   \\]\n   In our case, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = b \\), and \\( c = 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   D = b^2 - 16.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving the inequality**: To ensure there are no real solutions, we set the discriminant to be less than zero:\n   \\[\n   b^2 - 16 < 0.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging yields:\n   \\[\n   b^2 < 16.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding the interval for \\( b \\)**: Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   -4 < b < 4.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Expressing in interval notation**: The valid values for \\( b \\) can be expressed in interval notation as:\n   \\[\n   (-4, 4).\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe values of \\( b \\) for which \\( -2 \\) is not in the range of \\( f(x) \\) are:\n<ANSWER> (-4, 4) </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We see that $-2$ is not in the range of $f(x) = x^2 + bx + 2$ if and only if the equation $x^2 + bx + 2 = -2$ has no real roots.  We can re-write this equation as $x^2 + bx + 4 = 0$.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 = b^2 - 16$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $b^2 - 16 < 0$, or $b^2 < 16$.  The set of values of $b$ that satisfy this inequality is $b \\in \\boxed{(-4,4)}$."
