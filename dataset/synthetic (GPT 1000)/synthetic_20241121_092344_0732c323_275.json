  "problem": "Consider the paper triangle whose vertices are $(0,0), (34,0),$ and $(16,24).$ The vertices of its midpoint triangle are the midpoints of its sides. A triangular pyramid is formed by folding the triangle along the sides of its midpoint triangle. What is the volume of this pyramid?\n",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of finding the volume of the triangular pyramid formed when the triangle \\(ABC\\) is folded along the lines connecting the midpoints of its sides, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Triangle Vertices**:  \n   The triangle has vertices:\n   - \\(A = (0, 0)\\)\n   - \\(B = (34, 0)\\)\n   - \\(C = (16, 24)\\)\n\n2. **Calculate Midpoints of Each Side**:  \n   We find the midpoints of the triangle's sides:\n   - Midpoint of \\(AB\\):  \n     \\(P = \\left( \\frac{0 + 34}{2}, \\frac{0 + 0}{2} \\right) = (17, 0)\\)\n   - Midpoint of \\(BC\\):  \n     \\(Q = \\left( \\frac{34 + 16}{2}, \\frac{0 + 24}{2} \\right) = (25, 12)\\)\n   - Midpoint of \\(CA\\):  \n     \\(R = \\left( \\frac{16 + 0}{2}, \\frac{24 + 0}{2} \\right) = (8, 12)\\)\n\n   Thus, the midpoint triangle vertices are \\(P = (17, 0)\\), \\(Q = (25, 12)\\), and \\(R = (8, 12)\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Area of Triangle \\(ABC\\)**:  \n   We use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertex coordinates:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \\right|\n   \\]\n   Substituting the coordinates:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0(0-24) + 34(24-0) + 16(0-0) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 816 \\right| = 408\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Height of the Pyramid**:  \n   The height of the pyramid is determined by the distance from point \\(A\\) (the apex of the pyramid) to the line segment \\(QR\\). The line \\(QR\\) has a constant \\(y\\)-coordinate:\n   \\[\n   y = 12\n   \\]\n   Hence, the vertical distance from \\(A(0, 0)\\) to this line is \n   \\[\n   d = |12 - 0| = 12.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Area of Triangle \\(PQR\\)**:  \n   We find the base area (area of triangle \\(PQR\\)) using the same area formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 17(12-12) + 25(12-0) + 8(0-12) \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 + 300 - 96 \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 204 = 102.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the Volume of the Pyramid**:  \n   The volume \\(V\\) of a pyramid is given by:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 102 \\times 12 = \\frac{1224}{3} = 408.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final volume of the pyramid formed by folding the triangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{408}.\n\\]",

Suppose $P$ is the apex of the tetrahedron, and let $O$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to $\\triangle ABC$. The crux of this problem is the following lemma.\nLemma: The point $O$ is the orthocenter of $\\triangle ABC$.\nProof. Observe that\\[OF^2 - OE^2 = PF^2 - PE^2 = AF^2 - AE^2;\\]the first equality follows by the Pythagorean Theorem, while the second follows from $AF = FP$ and $AE = EP$. Thus, by the Perpendicularity Lemma, $AO$ is perpendicular to $FE$ and hence $BC$. Analogously, $O$ lies on the $B$-altitude and $C$-altitude of $\\triangle ABC$, and so $O$ is, indeed, the orthocenter of $\\triangle ABC$.\nTo find the coordinates of $O$, we need to find the intersection point of altitudes $BE$ and $AD$. The equation of $BE$ is simply $x=16$. $AD$ is perpendicular to line $BC$, so the slope of $AD$ is equal to the negative reciprocal of the slope of $BC$. $BC$ has slope $\\frac{24-0}{16-34}=-\\frac{4}{3}$, therefore $y=\\frac{3}{4} x$. These two lines intersect at $(16,12)$, so that's the base of the height of the tetrahedron.\nLet $S$ be the foot of altitude $BS$ in $\\triangle BPQ$. From the Pythagorean Theorem, $h=\\sqrt{BS^2-SO^2}$. However, since $S$ and $O$ are, by coincidence, the same point, $SO=0$ and $h=12$.\nThe area of the base is $102$, so the volume is $\\frac{102*12}{3}=\\boxed{408}$."
