  "problem": "In 2003, the average monthly rainfall in Mathborough was $41.5\\text{ mm.}$ In 2004, the average monthly rainfall in Mathborough was $2\\text{ mm}$ more than in 2003. What was the total amount of rain that fell in Mathborough in 2004?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thoughts just like I would if I were working this out on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with average monthly rainfall in Mathborough:\n\n- **2003:** \\(41.5 \\, \\text{mm}\\) per month\n- **2004:** \\(2 \\, \\text{mm}\\) more per month than in 2003\n\n**Question:** What's the total rainfall in 2004?\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis seems straightforward\u2014calculate the monthly increase for 2004, then find the total for the year. But let me brainstorm a bit to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate the 2004 Monthly Average:**  \n   Add \\(2 \\, \\text{mm}\\) to the 2003 average.\n\n2. **Compute Total Rainfall for 2004:**  \n   Multiply the new monthly average by 12 months.\n\n3. **Alternative Approach:**  \n   First, find the total rainfall for 2003, then add the extra rainfall for 2004.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBoth methods should work, but which one is simpler? The first method seems direct\u2014just adjusting the monthly average and multiplying by 12. I'll start with that, but keep the second method in mind as a backup.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the 2004 Monthly Average**\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[41.5 \\, \\text{mm} + 2 \\, \\text{mm} = 43.5 \\, \\text{mm}\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAdding \\(2 \\, \\text{mm}\\) per month makes sense since the problem states that 2004 had \\(2 \\, \\text{mm}\\) more rainfall each month.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes \\(43.5 \\, \\text{mm}\\) seem reasonable? Yes, it's a small increase, which aligns with the problem statement.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Compute Total Rainfall for 2004**\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[43.5 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 12 \\, \\text{months} = 522 \\, \\text{mm}\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nMultiplying the monthly average by 12 months should give the total annual rainfall. But let me double-check the math to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n\\[43.5 \\times 10 = 435\\]  \n\\[43.5 \\times 2 = 87\\]  \n\\[435 + 87 = 522\\]\n\n**Verification:**  \nThe calculation holds up. \\(522 \\, \\text{mm}\\) seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Validate with a Different Method**\n\n**Alternative Method:**  \n1. **Compute Total Rainfall for 2003:**  \n   \\[41.5 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 12 = 498 \\, \\text{mm}\\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Additional Rainfall for 2004:**  \n   \\[2 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 12 = 24 \\, \\text{mm}\\]\n\n3. **Total Rainfall for 2004:**  \n   \\[498 \\, \\text{mm} + 24 \\, \\text{mm} = 522 \\, \\text{mm}\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nUsing this method, I arrive at the same total of \\(522 \\, \\text{mm}\\). This consistency reassures me that the initial approach was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth methods lead to the same total rainfall for 2004. The increase of \\(2 \\, \\text{mm}\\) per month adds up to \\(24 \\, \\text{mm}\\) over the year, which aligns with the total increase.\n\n**Quick Sanity Check:**  \nGiven that 2004 had a slight increase in rainfall each month, a total of \\(522 \\, \\text{mm}\\) seems plausible compared to \\(498 \\, \\text{mm}\\) in 2003.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>522 \\, \\text{mm}</ANSWER>\n\n**Solution:**  \nThe total amount of rain that fell in Mathborough in 2004 was **522 mm**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy exploring both the straightforward calculation and an alternative method, I've confirmed that the total rainfall in 2004 is \\(522 \\, \\text{mm}\\). Checking the math at each step and validating with different strategies ensures accuracy and builds confidence in the solution.",
  "ground_truth": "Since the average monthly rainfall was $41.5\\text{ mm}$ in 2003, then the average monthly rainfall in 2004 was $41.5+2=43.5\\text{ mm}.$ Therefore, the total rainfall in 2004 was $12 \\times 43.5 = \\boxed{522}\\text{ mm}.$"
