  "problem": "Call a $3$-digit number geometric if it has $3$ distinct digits which, when read from left to right, form a geometric sequence. Find the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers.\n",
  "solution": "To find the largest and smallest 3-digit numbers that form a geometric sequence with distinct digits, we start by defining the conditions for a geometric sequence. For a 3-digit number represented as \\(abc\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the digits:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{c}{b}\n\\]\n\nThis leads to the equation:\n\n\\[\nb^2 = ac\n\\]\n\n### Constraints\n- The hundreds digit \\(a\\) can range from 1 to 9 (it cannot be zero).\n- The digits \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) can range from 0 to 9 but must be distinct and different from \\(a\\).\n\n### Finding Valid Combinations\nWe will test values for \\(a\\) from 1 to 9, derive potential values for \\(b\\), and subsequently calculate \\(c\\) while ensuring \\(b^2 = ac\\).\n\n**Testing values for \\(a\\):**\n\n1. **For \\(a = 1\\):**\n   - \\(b = 2, \\; c = 4 \\rightarrow 124\\) \n   - \\(b = 3, \\; c = 9 \\rightarrow 139\\)\n\n2. **For \\(a = 2\\):**\n   - \\(b = 5, \\; c = 6 \\rightarrow 256\\)\n\n3. **For \\(a = 3\\):**\n   - \\(b = 6, \\; c = 9 \\rightarrow 369\\)\n\n4. **For \\(a = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\):**\n   - Continuing up through the digits, we find valid combinations.\n\nCollecting valid geometric sequences, we get:\n- 124\n- 139\n- 256\n- 369\n- 482\n\n### Identify the Largest and Smallest Values\nFrom our valid combinations, the smallest number is \\(124\\) and the largest is \\(964\\) (noted from \\(a=9, b=6, c=4\\)).\n\n### Final Calculation\nThe difference between the largest and smallest geometric 3-digit numbers is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = 964 - 124 = 840\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe difference between the largest (964) and smallest (124) geometric 3-digit numbers is \n\n**840.**",
  "ground_truth": "Assume that the largest geometric number starts with a $9$. We know that the common ratio must be a rational of the form $k/3$ for some integer $k$, because a whole number should be attained for the 3rd term as well. When $k = 1$, the number is $931$. When $k = 2$, the number is $964$. When $k = 3$, we get $999$, but the integers must be distinct. By the same logic, the smallest geometric number is $124$. The largest geometric number is $964$ and the smallest is $124$. Thus the difference is $964 - 124 = \\boxed{840}$."
