  "problem": "Four standard, six-sided dice are to be rolled. If the product of their values turns out to be an even number, what is the probability their sum is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To find the probability that the sum of the values of four rolled dice is odd given that their product is even, we can follow these clear steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Conditions\n\n1. **Even Product**: The product of the dice is even if at least one die shows an even number (2, 4, or 6).\n2. **Odd Sum**: The sum is odd if an odd number of the dice show odd numbers. In our case, with four dice, this occurs if either one die is odd and three are even, or three dice are odd and one is even.\n\n### Step 2: Total Outcomes for the Rolls\n\nRolling four six-sided dice gives:\n\\[\n6^4 = 1296 \\text{ total outcomes.}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Count Outcomes with an Even Product\n\nThe product is odd only if all four dice are odd. The odd numbers available are 1, 3, and 5. The number of ways to roll four odd outcomes is:\n\\[\n3^4 = 81 \\text{ (all odd).}\n\\]\nThus, the outcomes that result in an even product are:\n\\[\n1296 - 81 = 1215.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Outcomes with Odd Sums (Given Even Product)\n\nNow, we will count the ways the sum can be odd under the condition that the product is even:\n\n#### Case 1: One Odd and Three Even\n- Choose 1 die to be odd: \\( \\binom{4}{1} = 4 \\).\n- The odd die can be any of 3 options (1, 3, 5).\n- Each of the 3 even dice can be any of 3 options (2, 4, 6).\n\nThus, the total for this case is:\n\\[\n4 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 3^3 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 27 = 324.\n\\]\n\n#### Case 2: Three Odd and One Even\n- Choose 1 die to be even: \\( \\binom{4}{1} = 4 \\).\n- Each of the 3 odd dice can be any of 3 options.\n- The even die can take any of 3 options.\n\nThus, the total for this case is:\n\\[\n4 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 3^1 = 4 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 3 = 324.\n\\]\n\n### Total Outcomes Where Product is Even and Sum is Odd\n\nAdding both cases together:\n\\[\n324 + 324 = 648.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Probability\n\nThe probability that the sum is odd given that the product is even is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Sum is odd | Product is even}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes with even product}} = \\frac{648}{1215}.\n\\]\n\nThis fraction can be simplified. The GCD of 648 and 1215 is 81:\n\\[\n\\frac{648 \\div 81}{1215 \\div 81} = \\frac{8}{15}.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the probability that the sum is odd given that the product is even is:\n\\[\n\\frac{8}{15}.\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER> \\(\\frac{8}{15}\\) solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "If the product of their values is even, then at least one of the dice rolls must yield an even number. To find how many ways this is possible, we consider the complementary possibility: suppose that all of the dice rolls yield odd numbers. There are $3^4$ ways of this occurring, out of a total of $6^4$ possibilities. It follows that there are $6^4 - 3^4$ ways of obtaining at least one even value.\n\nNow, we need to count how many ways we can obtain an odd sum. There must then be an odd number of odd numbers rolled, so there must be either one or three odd numbers rolled. If one odd number is rolled, then there are $4$ ways to pick which die yielded the odd number, and $3$ possibilities for each dice, yielding a total of $4 \\cdot 3^4$ possibilities. If three odd numbers are rolled, then there are again $4$ ways to pick which die yielded the even number and $3$ possibilities for each dice, yielding $4 \\cdot 3^4$. Thus, the desired probability is given by $\\frac{4 \\cdot 3^4 + 4\\cdot 3^4}{6^4 - 3^4} = \\frac{8}{2^4 - 1} = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{15}}$."
