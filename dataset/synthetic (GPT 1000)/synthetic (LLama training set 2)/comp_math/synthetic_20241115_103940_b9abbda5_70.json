    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, mimicking how I would naturally think through it as a human. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work, and be open to adjusting my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I think it involves calculating travel time based on distance and speed, similar to rates and proportions I've encountered before. \n\n- **Initial Idea:** Maybe I can set up a proportion since we're dealing with rates (miles per hour).\n- **Alternative Thoughts:** \n  - Perhaps I could use the formula for speed, but that seems a bit redundant here.\n  - I might also consider unit conversions, but the distances are already in miles, so that doesn't seem necessary.\n\nHonestly, I'm leaning towards setting up a proportion because that aligns well with the given information. But let's explore further to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Proportion Method:**\n   - Use the given rate to set up a ratio between miles and hours.\n\n2. **Speed Formula:**\n   - Recall the relationship between speed, distance, and time.\n\n3. **Unit Analysis:**\n   - Check if unit conversions are needed, but as noted earlier, they're not.\n\n4. **Dimensional Analysis:**\n   - Ensure that the units cancel out correctly to yield time in hours.\n\nI'm still thinking that the proportion method is the most straightforward. Let\u2019s start there and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up Proportions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI know that at Bob's current rate, he travels \\( m \\) miles in \\( h \\) hours. I need to find out how many hours it would take him to travel \\( h \\) miles.\n\n- Let\u2019s denote:\n  - Current rate: \\( \\frac{m \\text{ miles}}{h \\text{ hours}} \\)\n  - Time to travel \\( h \\) miles: \\( T \\text{ hours} \\)\n\n**Proportion Setup:**\n\\[\n\\frac{m \\text{ miles}}{h \\text{ hours}} = \\frac{h \\text{ miles}}{T \\text{ hours}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because I'm equating two rates, ensuring that the miles per hour are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Cross-Multiplying to Solve for \\( T \\)**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nm \\times T = h \\times h\n\\]\n\\[\nmT = h^2\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\nWait, so multiplying both sides by \\( T \\) helps isolate it. This seems correct so far. But let me check if I need to divide by anything next.\n\n**Reflection:**\nDoes this equation make sense? Yes, because it's balancing the proportions. Now, to solve for \\( T \\), I need to isolate it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\( T \\)**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nT = \\frac{h^2}{m}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThis formula tells me the time in hours to travel \\( h \\) miles at the given rate. It seems straightforward, but I should double-check if this aligns with real-world expectations.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Does it make sense numerically?**\n  - If \\( m = 10 \\) miles in \\( h = 2 \\) hours, then \\( T = \\frac{2^2}{10} = \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4 \\) hours. \n  - That seems reasonable for traveling 2 miles.\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, the calculation aligns with an intuitive check. The approach seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Proportion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet me verify if the proportion setup accurately reflects the problem statement. Perhaps there's another way to confirm the result.\n\n- **Alternative Approach: Speed Formula**\n  - Speed is distance divided by time: \\( \\text{Speed} = \\frac{m}{h} \\)\n  - To find time for \\( h \\) miles: \\( T = \\frac{h}{\\text{Speed}} = \\frac{h}{\\frac{m}{h}} = \\frac{h^2}{m} \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nBoth methods lead to the same formula for \\( T \\). This consistency suggests the solution is likely correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore concluding, let's ensure everything aligns with the problem's requirements and makes sense logically.\n\n- **Units Verification:**\n  - \\( T = \\frac{h^2}{m} \\)\n  - Units: \\( \\frac{h^2 \\text{ miles}^2}{m \\text{ miles}} = h \\text{ hours} \\)\n  \n- **Logic Check:**\n  - If Bob can travel \\( m \\) miles in \\( h \\) hours, traveling \\( h \\) miles should take more time, as \\( h \\) miles is the same as the time unit he initially traveled (recalling the distance is proportional to time).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe units work out, and the logic holds\u2014taking \\( h \\) miles should indeed take \\( \\frac{h^2}{m} \\) hours at the given rate. Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming and exploring various strategies, the proportion method was the most effective. By setting up a proportion based on Bob's travel rate, I derived the time needed to travel \\( h \\) miles as:\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{h^2}{m}\n\\]\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected and verified each step to ensure the approach was correct. Alternative methods confirmed the result, providing confidence in the solution's validity.",
