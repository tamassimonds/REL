We'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check our work frequently to ensure correctness. If something doesn't seem right, we'll adjust our approach. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so we have a curve parameterized by \\((x, y) = (t^3 + 7, -3t^2 - 6t - 5)\\). We're asked to find the point the curve passes through at \\(t = 2\\).\n\nThis reminds me of parametric equations I've worked with before. Typically, to find a specific point on such a curve, we need to substitute the given parameter value into both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) equations. But let's brainstorm other possible methods to ensure we're approaching it correctly.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Substitution Method:** Directly substitute \\(t = 2\\) into the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) equations.\n   \n2. **Graphical Interpretation:** Sketch the parametric equations to visually confirm the point at \\(t = 2\\). This might help catch any errors in calculation.\n\n3. **Check for Symmetry or Patterns:** See if there's any symmetry in the equations that might simplify the calculations.\n\n4. **Alternative Parameterization:** Perhaps express the curve in terms of a different parameter to see if it simplifies.\n\n**Initial Plan:**\n\nLet's start with the **Substitution Method**, as it's the most straightforward. If we encounter issues or want to verify our result, we'll explore the other strategies, like graphical interpretation or checking for patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Substitution Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSubstituting \\(t = 2\\) directly into both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) equations seems the most direct approach. Let's calculate that.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Find \\(x\\) at \\(t = 2\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   x = t^3 + 7 = 2^3 + 7 = 8 + 7 = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find \\(y\\) at \\(t = 2\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   y = -3t^2 - 6t - 5 = -3(2^2) - 6(2) - 5 = -3(4) - 12 - 5 = -12 - 12 - 5 = -29\n   \\]\n\n**Result:**\n\nSo, at \\(t = 2\\), the point on the curve is \\((15, -29)\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nWait, let me double-check these calculations to ensure they make sense.\n\n- For \\(x\\): \\(2^3 = 8\\), adding 7 gives \\(15\\). That seems correct.\n- For \\(y\\): Calculating step by step:\n\n  - \\(-3 \\times 4 = -12\\)\n  - \\(-6 \\times 2 = -12\\)\n  - Adding these: \\(-12 - 12 = -24\\)\n  - Finally, \\(-24 - 5 = -29\\)\n\nEverything checks out so far.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe substitution method worked as expected. But to be thorough, let's consider whether this point makes sense on the curve by checking other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEven though the substitution method provided a clear answer, exploring other strategies can confirm its correctness. Maybe plotting the equations or looking for patterns could add confidence.\n\n**Strategy 1: Graphical Interpretation**\n\n- **Idea:** Sketch the parametric equations to see if \\((15, -29)\\) visually aligns with the curve at \\(t = 2\\).\n\n- **Reflection:** I don't have graphing tools here, but I can think about the shapes involved. For instance, a cubic function typically has an inflection point, and a quadratic can open upwards or downwards. However, without a visual, this method is limited.\n\n**Strategy 2: Checking for Symmetry or Patterns**\n\n- **Idea:** See if the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) equations exhibit any symmetry or recurring patterns that might simplify calculations.\n\n- **Reflection:** The \\(x\\) equation is symmetrical in terms of powers of \\(t\\), but the \\(y\\) equation has a mixed sign and linear term. No obvious symmetry jumps out, so this might not help much.\n\n**Strategy 3: Alternative Parameterization**\n\n- **Idea:** Perhaps there's a way to express the curve using a different parameter that simplifies calculations.\n\n- **Reflection:** Given the problem's structure, reparameterizing doesn\u2019t seem necessary or beneficial.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter considering these alternative strategies, the **Substitution Method** remains the most straightforward and effective. However, it's always good to reflect and ensure multiple methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let's verify the calculations one last time. This time, I'll approach it by breaking down each term in the \\(y\\) equation more granularly.\n\n**Detailed Calculation for \\(y\\):**\n\n1. **Compute \\(t^2\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   t^2 = 2^2 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\(-3t^2\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   -3 \\times 4 = -12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\(-6t\\):**\n\n   \\[\n   -6 \\times 2 = -12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum the terms:**\n\n   \\[\n   -12 - 12 - 5 = -24 - 5 = -29\n   \\]\n\n**Result:**\n\nAgain, we arrive at \\(y = -29\\).\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- Both \\(x = 15\\) and \\(y = -29\\) make sense given the equations.\n- No errors were found in the repeated calculations.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nMultiple checks confirm that the point \\((15, -29)\\) is indeed correct for \\(t = 2\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy consistently applying the **Substitution Method** and verifying through reflection and alternative strategies, we confidently determine that the curve passes through the point \\((15, -29)\\) at \\(t = 2\\). Engaging in brainstorming, checking, and reflecting throughout the process ensured accuracy and deepened the understanding of the problem.",
