    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each approach, check my work along the way, and adjust as needed\u2014just like I would if solving it myself.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the expression \\((2^1)(2^2)(2^3)\\cdots (2^{99})(2^{100})\\), I think:\n\n- **Exponents and Multiplication:** This looks like a product of powers of 2. Maybe there's a property of exponents that can simplify it.\n- **Expansion:** I could expand it fully, but that seems impractical with so many terms.\n- **Patterns in Powers of Two:** Perhaps the tens and ones digits follow a pattern I can leverage.\n- **Modulo Calculations:** Checking the number modulo 100 might help since I only need the last two digits.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m leaning towards exploring properties of exponents or using modulo arithmetic to find the last two digits directly, since expanding all the way up to \\(2^{100}\\) would be massive.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Simplify Using Exponent Rules:**\n   - Think about how exponents multiply. Maybe I can combine them into a single exponent.\n  \n2. **Find Patterns in Powers of Two:**\n   - Calculate the first few powers of 2 and look for patterns in the last two digits.\n\n3. **Modulo 100 Calculation:**\n   - Since I need the last two digits, computing the entire product modulo 100 might be efficient.\n\n4. **Factorization Insights:**\n   - Consider how factors of 10 influence the last two digits, possibly separating into factors of 2 and 5.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify Using Exponent Rules**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s start by trying to simplify the product using properties of exponents. I remember that when multiplying numbers with the same base, you can add the exponents.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(2^1)(2^2)(2^3)\\cdots (2^{99})(2^{100}) = 2^{1+2+3+\\cdots+99+100}\n\\]\n\n**Wait, How Do I Sum These Exponents?**\n\nI realize I need to find the sum \\(1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 100\\). I recall that there's a formula for the sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo, for \\(n = 100\\):\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{100 \\times 101}{2} = 5050\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so the expression simplifies to \\(2^{5050}\\). But wait, this doesn't directly help me find the tens and ones digits. I still need to figure out \\(2^{5050} \\mod 100\\). Let\u2019s proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate \\(2^{5050} \\mod 100\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince we need the last two digits, calculating \\(2^{5050} \\mod 100\\) makes sense. I recall the **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)** might be useful here because 100 is composite (100 = 4 \u00d7 25).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Compute \\(2^{5050} \\mod 4\\)**\n2. **Compute \\(2^{5050} \\mod 25\\)**\n3. **Combine the results using CRT**\n\n**Step 2.1: Compute \\(2^{5050} \\mod 4\\)**\n\n\\[\n2^2 = 4 \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\n\\]\n\n**Wait, So...**\n\nAny power of 2 greater than or equal to 2 is congruent to 0 modulo 4. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n2^{5050} \\mod 4 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 2.2: Compute \\(2^{5050} \\mod 25\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\(2^{5050} \\mod 25\\). This is a bit trickier, but I remember **Euler\u2019s Theorem**, which is helpful for computing large exponents modulo a prime power.\n\n**Recalling Euler\u2019s Theorem:**\n\nEuler\u2019s Theorem states that if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then:\n\n\\[\na^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\phi(n)\\) is Euler\u2019s totient function.\n\n**Calculate \\(\\phi(25)\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\phi(25) = 25 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 25 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 20\n\\]\n\n**Application of Euler\u2019s Theorem:**\n\nSince 2 and 25 are coprime:\n\n\\[\n2^{20} \\equiv 1 \\mod 25\n\\]\n\n**Reducing the Exponent:**\n\nNow, reduce 5050 modulo 20 (because \\(2^{20} \\equiv 1\\) modulo 25):\n\n\\[\n5050 \\mod 20 = 10 \\quad (\\text{since } 5050 = 252 \\times 20 + 10)\n\\]\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n\\[\n2^{5050} \\equiv 2^{10} \\mod 25\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\(2^{10} \\mod 25\\):**\n\n\\[\n2^5 = 32 \\equiv 7 \\mod 25 \\\\\n2^{10} = (2^5)^2 = 7^2 = 49 \\equiv 24 \\mod 25\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAlright, so:\n\n\\[\n2^{5050} \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\\\\n2^{5050} \\equiv 24 \\mod 25\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to find a number that satisfies both congruences:\n\n\\[\nx \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\\\\nx \\equiv 24 \\mod 25\n\\]\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nUse CRT to find such an \\(x\\). Since 4 and 25 are coprime, there\u2019s a unique solution modulo 100.\n\n**Step 3.1: Express \\(x\\) in Terms of One Congruence**\n\nSince \\(x \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\), \\(x\\) must be a multiple of 4. Let's write:\n\n\\[\nx = 4k \\quad \\text{for some integer } k\n\\]\n\n**Step 3.2: Substitute into the Second Congruence**\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 4k\\) into \\(x \\equiv 24 \\mod 25\\):\n\n\\[\n4k \\equiv 24 \\mod 25\n\\]\n\n**Step 3.3: Simplify the Congruence**\n\nTo solve for \\(k\\), divide both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\nk \\equiv 6 \\mod 25\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, can I just divide by 4? Yes, because 4 and 25 are coprime, so dividing by 4 is valid.\n\n**Step 3.4: Express \\(k\\) in Terms of Multiples of 25**\n\n\\[\nk = 25m + 6 \\quad \\text{for some integer } m\n\\]\n\n**Step 3.5: Substitute Back to Find \\(x\\)**\n\n\\[\nx = 4k = 4(25m + 6) = 100m + 24\n\\]\n\n**And So...**\n\n\\[\nx \\equiv 24 \\mod 100\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, interesting. The solution is \\(x \\equiv 24 \\mod 100\\). This means \\(x\\), the last two digits of \\(2^{5050}\\), is 24.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let\u2019s double-check if \\(x = 24\\) satisfies both original congruences.\n\n**Check \\(x \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\):**\n\n\\[\n24 \\mod 4 = 0 \\quad (\\text{Since } 24 \\div 4 = 6)\n\\]\n\n**Check \\(x \\equiv 24 \\mod 25\\):**\n\n\\[\n24 \\mod 25 = 24 \\quad (\\text{Since } 24 < 25)\n\\]\n\n**Wait, Everything Checks Out!**\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so \\(x = 24\\) is indeed correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe problem asks for the product of the tens digit and the ones digit of \\(2^{5050}\\). We\u2019ve determined that the last two digits are 24.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Tens digit} = 2 \\\\\n\\text{Ones digit} = 4 \\\\\n\\text{Product} = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense. The tens and ones digits multiply to 8, which feels reasonable given the calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Did I correctly apply CRT?** Yes, the steps align with CRT procedures.\n- **Does the solution satisfy both congruences?** Yes, \\(x = 24\\) meets both \\(x \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\) and \\(x \\equiv 24 \\mod 25\\).\n- **Is the final answer logical?** Multiplying the digits 2 and 4 gives 8, which fits the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy breaking down the problem into manageable steps and checking each part along the way, I verified that the product of the tens digit and the ones digit of \\(2^{5050}\\) is **8**. Exploring different strategies and confirming the accuracy at each stage ensured a correct and reliable solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Define the sequence $$x_i = \\text{the remainder when }2^i\\text{ is divided by 100}.$$  Then note that $x_{22} = x_2 = 4$, and thus this sequence repeats every 20 terms from $x_2$ onward.  The desired product is $2^{1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 99 + 100} = 2^{5050}$.  If we can find $x_{5050}$, we will then be done.  But since $5050 = 20\\cdot 252 + 10$, we see that $x_{5050} = x_{10} = 24$.  Thus our answer is $2\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{8}$."
