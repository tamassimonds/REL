    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process exactly as I would tackle it in my head, reflecting, brainstorming, and checking at each step to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the question is about placing two indistinguishable pieces on an \\(8 \\times 8\\) chessboard, where the pieces must either be in the same row or the same column. Immediately, this reminds me of combinatorics problems involving board arrangements. I think we'll need to consider both rows and columns separately and then possibly account for any overlapping scenarios.\n\nBut wait\u2014since the pieces are indistinguishable, that might simplify things a bit. There's no need to differentiate between which piece is in which position.\n\n**Brainstorming Initial Strategies:**\n1. **Calculate row arrangements:** Find the ways to place two pieces in the same row across all rows.\n2. **Calculate column arrangements:** Do the same for columns.\n3. **Check for overlapping cases:** Ensure that placing pieces in both rows and columns doesn\u2019t double-count any scenarios.\n\nI\u2019ll start exploring these strategies step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Row Arrangements**\n\n**Thinking:**\nLet's begin by considering placing two indistinguishable pieces in the same row. There are 8 rows on the chessboard.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- In each row, there are 8 squares.\n- To place two pieces in the same row, I need to choose 2 distinct squares out of the 8.\n\nSince the pieces are indistinguishable, the number of ways to choose 2 squares in a row is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of squares, and \\( k \\) is the number of squares to choose.\n\nSo, for one row:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\nThere are 28 ways to place two indistinguishable pieces in a single row.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThat seems reasonable. Now, since there are 8 rows, I should multiply the number of ways per row by the total number of rows:\n\n\\[\n8 \\text{ rows} \\times 28 \\text{ ways per row} = 224 \\text{ total ways}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nThis makes sense\u2014each row independently allows for 28 configurations, and with 8 rows, we simply scale that up.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Column Arrangements**\n\n**Thinking:**\nNow, let\u2019s consider placing two pieces in the same column. Similarly, there are 8 columns on the chessboard.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- In each column, there are 8 squares.\n- Again, we choose 2 distinct squares out of the 8, so it\u2019s the same calculation as with rows.\n\nFor one column:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = 28\n\\]\nWith 8 columns:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ columns} \\times 28 \\text{ ways per column} = 224 \\text{ total ways}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, just like with rows, there are 224 ways to place two pieces in the same column.\n\n**Check:**\nThis symmetry between rows and columns is consistent. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Overlapping Cases**\n\n**Thinking:**\nNow, I need to ensure that I\u2019m not double-counting any scenarios. Since the pieces can be in the same row *or* the same column, and rows and columns are independent, there shouldn't be overlapping cases.\n\n**Is There Double-Counting?**\nAt first glance, it might seem like we\u2019re double-counting positions where rows and columns intersect, but since the pieces are either all in a row or all in a column, these scenarios don\u2019t overlap.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, we can simply add the two totals together.\n\n\\[\n224 \\text{ (row)} + 224 \\text{ (column)} = 448 \\text{ total ways}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nThis approach seems correct. Each set of arrangements\u2014rows and columns\u2014is independent, and there are no overlapping cases to subtract.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{448}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**\n- **Symmetry:** The board is symmetrical, so treating rows and columns separately but equally makes sense.\n- **Indistinguishability:** Since the pieces are indistinguishable, choosing two spots per row or column without worrying about the order simplifies the calculation.\n\n**Alternative Approaches:**\n- **Visualizing the Board:** I could imagine physically placing the pieces row by row and column by column to verify.\n- **Cross-Verification with Smaller Boards:** Testing this method on a smaller board (e.g., \\(4 \\times 4\\)) to see if the calculations hold could be a good sanity check.\n\n**Testing on a \\(4 \\times 4\\) Board:**\n- **Rows:** \\( \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\) ways per row, 4 rows \u2192 \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\)\n- **Columns:** Same as rows \u2192 \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\)\n- **Total:** \\( 24 + 24 = 48 \\)\n\nThis matches expectations for a smaller board, reinforcing the validity of the approach.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nBy methodically breaking down the problem into row and column arrangements and ensuring no double-counting occurs, I\u2019m confident that the total number of ways to place the two indistinguishable pieces is indeed **448**.\n\n---\n\n**",

  "ground_truth": "The first piece can go in any of the $64$ squares. The second piece can then be in any of $14$ positions, since there are $7$ unoccupied squares in the row of the first piece, as well as $7$ unoccupied squares in the column of the first piece. This would seem to give us $64\\cdot 14$ choices for the placement of the two pieces. However, order doesn't matter (we said the pieces are indistinguishable), so the actual number of choices is $(64\\cdot 14)/2$, which is $\\boxed{448}$."
