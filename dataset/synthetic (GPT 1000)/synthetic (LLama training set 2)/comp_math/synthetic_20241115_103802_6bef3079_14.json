How many of the pages have page numbers whose digits add up to exactly 4?**\n\nFirst off, my **initial reaction** is that this involves **checking each page number** to see if the sum of its digits equals 4. This feels like a **counting problem**, maybe similar to finding specific combinations or patterns within numbers.\n\nBut then I think, **\"This looks a bit tedious if I have to check each page one by one from 1 to 1,000.\"** That would take a lot of time, so I'm wondering if there's a more efficient strategy.\n\nI recall dealing with problems where you count certain digit properties, like sums or products. **Maybe I can categorize the page numbers** based on the number of digits and see if there's a pattern.\n\n**Alternative Ideas:**\n- **Enumerate each page number:** Start from 1 and go up to 1,000, adding the digits to see if they sum to 4.\n- **Use combinatorics:** Think about how digits can combine to make 4.\n- **Break down by digit length:** Analyze 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers separately.\n- **Digital root or modulus approach:** Consider properties of numbers that might simplify the sum.\n\nRight now, **I'm leaning towards breaking it down by digit length** because it seems more organized and might reveal patterns. But I need to explore further to see if this is the best approach.\n\n### **Exploring the Digit Length Strategy**\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing 1-Digit Numbers (1 to 9)**\n\nOkay, let\u2019s start with **1-digit numbers**. **There are only nine of them (1 through 9)**. It's quick to check:\n\n- **Page 1:** 1 \u2794 Sum = 1\n- **Page 2:** 2 \u2794 Sum = 2\n- **Page 3:** 3 \u2794 Sum = 3\n- **Page 4:** 4 \u2794 Sum = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Page 5:** 5 \u2794 Sum = 5\n- **Page 6:** 6 \u2794 Sum = 6\n- **Page 7:** 7 \u2794 Sum = 7\n- **Page 8:** 8 \u2794 Sum = 8\n- **Page 9:** 9 \u2794 Sum = 9\n\n**Reflection:** Only **Page 4** has digits that sum to 4. **That's straightforward.** \n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, each single-digit number's sum is equal to the number itself. So only 4 qualifies.\n\n**Thinking:** This is a small part of the total, but **it sets a foundation** for the larger numbers. **Maybe I can apply a similar logic** to multi-digit numbers.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing 2-Digit Numbers (10 to 99)**\n\nNext, let\u2019s tackle **2-digit numbers**. **There are 90 of them (10 to 99)**, so this will take a bit more work but should still be manageable.\n\nI can **list out the possibilities** where the **sum of the digits equals 4.**\n\nLet\u2019s denote a 2-digit number as **AB**, where:\n- A is the **tens digit**\n- B is the **units digit**\n\nSo, **A + B = 4.**\n\n**Time to brainstorm combinations:**\n\n- **A = 0:** \u2794 Not possible because it\u2019s a 2-digit number.\n- **A = 1:** \u2794 1 + B = 4 \u2794 B = 3 \u2794 Number = 13\n- **A = 2:** \u2794 2 + B = 4 \u2794 B = 2 \u2794 Number = 22\n- **A = 3:** \u2794 3 + B = 4 \u2794 B = 1 \u2794 Number = 31\n- **A = 4:** \u2794 4 + B = 4 \u2794 B = 0 \u2794 Number = 40\n- **A = 5 or more:** \u2794 Sum exceeds 4.\n\n**List of 2-digit numbers: 13, 22, 31, 40**\n\n**Reflection:** **Wait**, I see that only the numbers where the **tens digit** is 1, 2, 3, or 4 work. Once the **tens digit** is 5 or higher, the **sum exceeds 4**, making it impossible.\n\n**Check:** Let me quickly add them up:\n- **13:** 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **22:** 2 + 2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **31:** 3 + 1 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **40:** 4 + 0 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll these numbers check out.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing 3-Digit Numbers (100 to 1000)**\n\nNow, onto the **3-digit numbers**. This is where it gets a bit more complex. **There are 900 of them (100 to 999)**, so I need to be careful with my approach.\n\nInitially, I'm thinking about **breaking it down** by the **hundreds, tens, and units digits**. Let's denote a 3-digit number as **ABC**, where:\n- A is the **hundreds digit**\n- B is the **tens digit**\n- C is the **units digit**\n\nThe condition is **A + B + C = 4**.\n\n**Brainstorming Options:**\n- **Look for patterns:** Maybe the hundreds digit can only be 1 or 2 because if it's 3 or more, the sum exceeds 4.\n- **List all combinations:** This might be too time-consuming, so perhaps focusing on feasible combinations is better.\n- **Use constraints:** Apply the condition to limit possible values for B and C.\n\n**Thinking:** **Let\u2019s start by seeing what the hundreds digit can be.**\n\n- **A = 1:** \u2794 1 + B + C = 4 \u2794 B + C = 3\n- **A = 2:** \u2794 2 + B + C = 4 \u2794 B + C = 2\n- **A = 3 or more:** \u2794 Impossible because the sum would exceed 4.\n\n**Reflection:** It seems that the **hundreds digit** can only be **1 or 2**. That narrows down the possibilities significantly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Expanding on A = 1 and A = 2**\n\nLet\u2019s delve deeper into each case.\n\n**Case 1: A = 1**\n- **Sum of B and C = 3.**\n  \n  Possible combinations:\n  - B = 0, C = 3 \u2794 103\n  - B = 1, C = 2 \u2794 112\n  - B = 2, C = 1 \u2794 121\n  - B = 3, C = 0 \u2794 130\n  \n  **List:** 103, 112, 121, 130\n\n**Case 2: A = 2**\n- **Sum of B and C = 2.**\n  \n  Possible combinations:\n  - B = 0, C = 2 \u2794 202\n  - B = 1, C = 1 \u2794 211\n  - B = 2, C = 0 \u2794 220\n  \n  **List:** 202, 211, 220\n\n**Reflection:** **Hmm**, this makes sense. Each case constrains B and C, ensuring the sum remains 4. **I\u2019m seeing a pattern here:** The numbers are combinations where the higher place value is set, and the lower ones adjust to meet the sum.\n\n**Check:** Before proceeding, let me quickly verify each number:\n- **103:** 1 + 0 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **112:** 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **121:** 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **130:** 1 + 3 + 0 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **202:** 2 + 0 + 2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **211:** 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- **220:** 2 + 2 + 0 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll numbers check out!\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Counting the Valid Page Numbers**\n\nAlright, I\u2019ve categorized the valid page numbers by their digit length:\n\n1. **1-digit numbers:** 1 page (Page 4)\n2. **2-digit numbers:** 4 pages (13, 22, 31, 40)\n3. **3-digit numbers:** 7 pages (103, 112, 121, 130, 202, 211, 220)\n\n**Total Valid Pages:** 1 + 4 + 7 = **12 pages**\n\n**Reflection:** **Wait a minute,** I expected there to be more than just 12 pages. Does that seem too low? Let me double-check my work to see if I missed any combinations or patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Reevaluating the 3-Digit Numbers**\n\n**Thinking:** **Actually, I might have over-constrained the hundreds digit.** Let's see if there are more possibilities.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Maybe the hundreds digit can be 0:** But that would make it a 2-digit number, so it\u2019s not applicable here.\n- **What if the sum of tens and units digits is more flexible?**\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\nLet\u2019s reconsider the **sum of digits = 4** without strictly limiting the hundreds place.\n\n**Step 6a: Considering All 3-Digit Numbers (100 to 999)**\n\nWait, I need to **rethink my assumptions.** The problem states page numbers up to **1,000**, so I should consider **all three-digit numbers**, not just those starting with 1 or 2.\n\n**Reflection:** Perhaps I should **list all combinations** where the sum of digits equals 4, regardless of the leading digit.\n\n**Step 6b: Reevaluating the Hundreds Digit**\n\n**A = 1:**\n- B + C = 3 \u2794 Same as before: 103, 112, 121, 130\n\n**A = 2:**\n- B + C = 2 \u2794 Same as before: 202, 211, 220\n\n**A = 0:** Wait, **0 isn't a valid hundreds digit** in a three-digit number. **But** since the textbook has **1,000 pages**, maybe I can reconsider the range.\n\n**Case: A = 0 is Invalid**\n\n**Reflection:** **Realization:** I can\u2019t have a three-digit number starting with 0. **So, A must be 1 or 2.** But then, are there more combinations?\n\n**Step 6c: Exploring Additional Combinations**\n\nLet\u2019s see if I can find more combinations without over-constraining.\n\n- **Possible values for A (1, 2):**\n  - **A = 1:** B + C = 3\n    - B = 0, C = 3 \u2794 103\n    - B = 1, C = 2 \u2794 112\n    - B = 2, C = 1 \u2794 121\n    - B = 3, C = 0 \u2794 130\n  - **A = 2:** B + C = 2\n    - B = 0, C = 2 \u2794 202\n    - B = 1, C = 1 \u2794 211\n    - B = 2, C = 0 \u2794 220\n\n**List of Valid 3-Digit Numbers:**\n- **A = 1:** 103, 112, 121, 130\n- **A = 2:** 202, 211, 220\n\nTotal: **7 pages**\n\n**Reflection:** **Hmm**, that still doesn\u2019t seem right. **Maybe I need to reconsider my constraints.** Let me brainstorm again.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6d: Relooking the Hundreds Digit Approach**\n\n**Thinking:** **Perhaps there's a better way to account for three-digit numbers without missing combinations.**\n\n**Alternative Approach:** Let's **look for patterns** in the valid numbers I've already identified.\n\n**Pattern Identification:**\n\n- **The sum of digits equals 4.**\n- **The leading digit (hundreds place) is either 1 or 2.**\n\n**Testing Different Strategies:**\n\n**Strategy 1:** **Allow digits to repeat.**\n\nBut, **wait**, in page numbers, digits can\u2019t repeat\u2014**so this idea is incorrect.** \n\n**Strategy 2:** **Only consider unique digit combinations.**\n\nThis seems correct, but I might be missing some cases.\n\n**Realization:** **I might have limited the hundreds digit too much.** **Actually,** the leading digit can only be **1 or 2,** but **B and C** need to adjust accordingly.\n\n**Example:**\n- **A = 1:** B + C = 3\n- **A = 2:** B + C = 2\n\n**Wait:** **Am I missing numbers?** Let\u2019s see...\n\n---\n\n**Step 6e: Cross-Checking with a Complete List**\n\n**Thinking:** **To be sure, perhaps I should list all three-digit numbers starting from 100 and check their digit sums.** \n\n**Strategy:** **Create a complete list** and filter those whose digits sum to 4.\n\n**Reflection:** **This is time-consuming,** but it will ensure accuracy.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nLet me manually check if my previous list includes all valid combinations.\n\n**Rechecking A = 1:**\n- 103: 1 + 0 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- 112: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- 121: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- 130: 1 + 3 + 0 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Rechecking A = 2:**\n- 202: 2 + 0 + 2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- 211: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- 220: 2 + 2 + 0 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Total Valid 3-Digit Numbers:** 7 pages\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, **that matches my previous count.** **But,** I still wonder if there are more numbers.\n\n**Realization:** **Hold on,** I may have missed considering **all pages up to 1,000.** \n\n**Recalling:** The textbook has **1,000 pages,** so I should include **page 1,000** as well.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Considering Page 1,000**\n\n**Page 1,000:**\n- **Digits:** 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:** **Oh,** it doesn't satisfy the condition since the sum is **1,** not **4.** \n\n**Check:** **So, Page 1,000 is not included.** \n\n**Thinking:** **Wait,** does this mean there are only 12 pages in total? **That seems low for a textbook with 1,000 pages.** \n\n**Realization:** **Perhaps,** but looking closely, **my earlier counts add up correctly.** \n\n**Reflection:** **Yes,** the total is **12 pages,** and considering the constraints, **it makes sense.** \n\n---\n\n**Step 8: Finalizing the Answer**\n\nAfter carefully examining each digit length and ensuring all valid combinations are accounted for, the total number of pages with digits that sum to 4 is **12 pages.**\n\n**Breakdown:**\n- **1-digit numbers:** 1 page (4)\n- **2-digit numbers:** 4 pages (13, 22, 31, 40)\n- **3-digit numbers:** 7 pages (103, 112, 121, 130, 202, 211, 220)\n\n**Total: 1 + 4 + 7 = 12 pages**\n\n**Reflection:** **This feels right.** The count aligns with the constraints and patterns identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough exploring different strategies and reflecting on each step, I determined that there are **12 pages** in the textbook where the page numbers have digits that sum to **4.**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- **Breaking down by digit length** helped organize the problem.\n- **Pattern recognition** was crucial in identifying valid combinations.\n- **Checking and reflecting** after each step ensured accuracy.\n- **Considering all possibilities,** including higher digit numbers, was essential to avoid undercounting.\n\n**Final Answer:** **12 pages** have page numbers whose digits add up to exactly **4.**\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step approach, with all its reflections and corrections, provides a clear understanding of how to tackle the problem. Let me know if you need further clarification!\n\n### **Ahh, I See I've Made an Error**\n\nAlright, let's dive back into this problem.

  "ground_truth": "There are only a few ways to make one, two, and three digit numbers add up to $4$.  The only one-digit number whose sum is $4$ is $4$ itself.  Continuing with two-digit numbers, we note that the digits must be $4$ and $0$, $1$ and $3$, or $2$ and $2$.  This means that $13$, $22$, $31$, and $40$ are the only two-digit numbers whose digits sum to 4.  For the three-digit numbers, we organize the work in a table.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\\hline\nPossible Digits&Possible Numbers&Total Possibilities\\\\\\hline\n4,0,0&400&1\\\\\\hline\n3,1,0&103, 130, 301, 310&4\\\\\\hline\n2,2,0&202, 220&2\\\\\\hline\n2,1,1&112, 121, 211&3\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}Adding up the last column, we see that there are $10$ three-digits numbers whose digits add up to $4$.  Adding those to the possible one-and-two digit numbers, we get $\\boxed{15}$ pages in the textbook which have digits that add up to $4$."
