    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, reflecting naturally as we think through different strategies, check our work, and adjust our approach as needed. I'll try to think out loud, just like I would when solving a problem on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem states:\n\\[ |a| = |b| = |a + b| \\]\nand asks for the sum of all possible values of \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) being nonzero complex numbers.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Magnitude Equality:** The condition \\( |a| = |b| = |a + b| \\) is interesting. It suggests that the magnitudes of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are equal, and also, the magnitude of their sum is the same. This feels like a geometric constraint in the complex plane.\n  \n- **Geometric Interpretation:** Maybe representing \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as vectors in the complex plane could help. If \\(|a| = |b|\\), they could form an isosceles triangle with \\(a + b\\), but \\(|a + b|\\) being equal to \\(|a|\\) and \\(|b|\\) adds another layer.\n  \n- **Algebraic Approach:** Alternatively, I could try to set up equations based on the properties of complex numbers. Maybe expressing everything in terms of real and imaginary components could work.\n  \n- **Use of Roots of Unity:** Thinking back to similar problems, perhaps using complex roots of unity or Euler's formula might provide a connection since their magnitudes are inherently 1.\n\n**Wait, That Can't Be Right Because...**\n\nBut before diving in, I recall that in the complex plane, if \\(|a + b| = |a| = |b|\\), \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must have a specific angular relationship (like being at \\(60^\\circ\\) or \\(120^\\circ\\) angles relative to each other). This geometric insight might simplify things.\n\n**Time to Explore Both Strategies: Geometric and Algebraic**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the geometric approach, as it seems intuitive. If that doesn't work out, we can switch to the algebraic method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Geometric Interpretation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Imagine the complex numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as vectors in the complex plane.\n- Given \\(|a| = |b|\\), both vectors have the same length.\n- \\(|a + b| = |a| = |b|\\) implies that the magnitude of the resultant vector \\(a + b\\) is also equal to the lengths of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n  \n**Realization:**\n\nWait, for the magnitude of \\(a + b\\) to equal the magnitudes of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the vectors \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be positioned at specific angles to each other. Specifically, the angle between them is either \\(60^\\circ\\) or \\(120^\\circ\\). This aligns with the properties of equilateral and isosceles triangles in the complex plane.\n\n**Calculating the Allowed Angles:**\n\n- If the angle between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\(60^\\circ\\) or \\(120^\\circ\\), then:\n  \\[\n  |a + b| = |a| \\cdot \\cos(30^\\circ) = |b| \\cdot \\cos(30^\\circ) = |a| \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n  \\]\n  But this doesn't satisfy \\(|a + b| = |a|\\) unless \\(|a| = |b| = 1\\).\n\n**Oh Wait, This Leads to...**\n\nBut if \\(|a| = |b| = 1\\) and the angle is \\(60^\\circ\\) or \\(120^\\circ\\), then \\(|a + b| = 1\\), which satisfies the condition. So, let's proceed with this angle condition.\n\n**Checking if this Approach Makes Sense:**\n\nDoes this angle condition satisfy \\(|a + b| = |a|\\)? Let\u2019s see.\n\n- If \\(|a| = |b| = 1\\) and the angle between them is \\(60^\\circ\\):\n  \\[\n  |a + b| = |a| \\cdot \\cos(60^\\circ) + |b| \\cdot \\cos(60^\\circ) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n  \\]\n  But this gives \\(|a + b| = 1\\), which matches \\( |a| \\) and \\( |b| \\). So, we're on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Assigning Values Based on Magnitudes and Angles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let's assign \\( |a| = |b| = 1 \\) without loss of generality. This simplifies calculations since we can use Euler's formula.\n  \n- Assume \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are unit complex numbers at angles \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\) respectively, with \\( \\theta - \\phi = 60^\\circ \\) or \\( 120^\\circ \\).\n\n**Connecting to Euler's Formula:**\n\nRecall Euler's formula:\n\\[\ne^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)\n\\]\n\nSo, let's set:\n\\[\na = e^{i\\theta}, \\quad b = e^{i\\phi}\n\\]\n\n**Wait, This Might Be Overcomplicating Things Because...**\n\nBut maybe dealing with angles directly could complicate the algebra. Perhaps representing \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in terms of real and imaginary parts might be clearer.\n\n**Reconsidering the Approach:**\n\nLet\u2019s write \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in Cartesian form while maintaining \\(|a| = |b| = 1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Expressing \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in Cartesian Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Since \\(|a| = |b| = 1\\), we can write:\n  \\[\n  a = x + iy, \\quad b = u + iv\n  \\]\n  where \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\) and \\(u^2 + v^2 = 1\\).\n  \n- The condition \\(|a + b| = 1\\) becomes:\n  \\[\n  |(x + u) + i(y + v)| = \\sqrt{(x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2} = 1\n  \\]\n\n**Setting Up Equations:**\n\nNow we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2 + y^2 = 1 \\\\\nu^2 + v^2 = 1 \\\\\n(x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2 = 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n**Oh Wait, This Seems Redundant Because...**\n\nBut the third equation is essentially the sum of the squares of the first two equations' sums, which should naturally hold if \\(|a| = |b| = 1\\). Maybe this isn't the best path.\n\n**Instead, Let's Leverage the Geometric Insight:**\n\nGiven that the angle between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is either \\(60^\\circ\\) or \\(120^\\circ\\), let's see how this helps.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Utilizing the Law of Cosines**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The law of cosines states:\n  \\[\n  |a + b|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + 2 |a| |b| \\cos(\\angle a b)\n  \\]\n  \n- Given \\(|a| = |b| = 1\\) and \\(\\angle a b = 60^\\circ\\) or \\(120^\\circ\\):\n  \\[\n  |a + b|^2 = 1 + 1 + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\cos(60^\\circ) = 2 + 1 = 3\n  \\]\n  or\n  \\[\n  |a + b|^2 = 2 + 2 \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{2}) = 2 - 1 = 1\n  \\]\n  \n**Wait, This Doesn't Align Because...**\n\nBut we need \\(|a + b|^2 = 1\\), which matches only when \\(\\angle a b = 120^\\circ\\). So, the \\(60^\\circ\\) case seems inconsistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOnly the case where the angle between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\(120^\\circ\\) satisfies all the conditions.\n\n**Checking Validity:**\n\nTo ensure we haven't missed anything, let's re-examine the angle conditions:\n- **Angle \\(60^\\circ\\):** Leads to \\(|a + b|^2 = 3\\), which contradicts \\(|a + b|^2 = 1\\).\n- **Angle \\(120^\\circ\\):** Matches \\(|a + b|^2 = 1\\).\n\nThus, only the \\(120^\\circ\\) angle is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Determining \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- With \\(|a| = |b| = 1\\) and the angle between them being \\(120^\\circ\\), let's find \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n  \n- We know:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{e^{i\\theta}}{e^{i\\phi}} = e^{i(\\theta - \\phi)}\n  \\]\n  \n- Since \\(\\theta - \\phi = 120^\\circ\\), we have:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{a}{b} = e^{i\\cdot 120^\\circ} = e^{i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}} = -\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Let\u2019s check:\n- **Magnitude:** \\(|\\frac{a}{b}| = |b|^{-1} |a| = 1\\), which is correct.\n  \n- **Angle:** The angle difference is indeed \\(120^\\circ\\), aligning with our conditions.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n\nWait, could there be another angle that satisfies the condition? Maybe an angle of \\(240^\\circ\\) (which is \\(120^\\circ\\) counter-clockwise)? Let\u2019s explore this.\n\n**Exploring \\(240^\\circ\\):**\n\n- If \\(\\theta - \\phi = -120^\\circ\\), then:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{a}{b} = e^{i\\cdot (-120^\\circ)} = e^{-i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}} = -\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- This represents the complex conjugate of \\(e^{i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\\).\n\n**Wait, Am I Missing Something Because...**\n\nBut both \\(e^{i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\\) and \\(e^{-i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\\) have the same magnitude and satisfy \\(|a + b| = |a| = |b|\\) with the appropriate angle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere are two possible values for \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\):\n1. \\(e^{i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}} = -\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)\n2. \\(e^{-i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}} = -\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Summing All Possible Values of \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- We\u2019ve identified two possible values for \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{a}{b} = e^{i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{a}{b} = e^{-i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\n  \\]\n  \n- To find the sum:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Sum} = e^{i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}} + e^{-i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\n  \\]\n  \n**Calculating the Sum:**\n\nRecall Euler's formula \\(e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i\\sin(x)\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ne^{i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}} &= \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ne^{-i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}} &= \\cos\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nAdding them together:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = -1 + 0i = -1\n\\]\n\n**Wait, Let Me Check That:**\n\nDoes the sum make sense? Let\u2019s see:\n- The imaginary parts cancel out: \\(i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - i\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0i\\).\n- The real parts add up: \\(-\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = -1\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sum of all possible values of \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) is \\(-1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Correctness Check:** Throughout the steps, we've ensured that the magnitude conditions are consistently met by carefully selecting the angles between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n- **Multiple Strategies:** Initially considering both geometric and algebraic approaches helped verify the solution\u2019s validity. \n- **Summing the Values:** Adding the two possible values of \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) confirmed the final result.\n\n**Aha Moment:**\n\nRealizing that both \\(e^{i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\\) and \\(e^{-i\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\\) are valid solutions due to the symmetry in the complex plane was key. This symmetry leads to the imaginary parts canceling out when summing, resulting in a real sum of \\(-1\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe sum of all possible values of \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) is \\(\\boxed{-1}\\).",
