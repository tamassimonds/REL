I've seen problems like this before where I need to determine the total number of terms in a given sequence.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Arithmetic Sequence:** This reminds me of an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by a fixed amount. I think I should verify if the differences between the consecutive terms are constant.\n  \n- **Counting Method:** Maybe I can list out the numbers and count them, but that might be time-consuming.\n  \n- **Formula for Arithmetic Sequences:** If it is indeed an arithmetic sequence, I could use the formula for the number of terms in such a sequence.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, I feel the arithmetic sequence approach makes the most sense here. If I can confirm that the sequence is arithmetic, I can use the formula to find the number of terms without listing all of them.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Check for Constant Differences**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore proceeding, I want to confirm that the sequence is arithmetic by examining the differences between consecutive terms.\n\n- Calculate the difference between\u00a0-36\u00a0and\u00a0-29:  \n  \\(-29 - (-36) = 7\\)\n\n- Difference between\u00a0-29\u00a0and\u00a0-22:  \n  \\(-22 - (-29) = 7\\)\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nBoth differences are\u00a07. This suggests that the sequence increases by 7 each time.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nWait, since the difference is constant, I think it's safe to conclude that this is indeed an arithmetic sequence. That aligns with my initial thought.\n\n**Strategy 2: Use the Arithmetic Sequence Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I'm confident it's an arithmetic sequence, I can use the formula for finding the number of terms (\\(n\\)):\n\n\\[ \nn = \\frac{a_l - a_1}{d} + 1 \n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(a_l\\) = last term (48)\n- \\(a_1\\) = first term (-36)\n- \\(d\\) = common difference (7)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis formula seems straightforward. Let me plug in the values and calculate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Arithmetic Sequence Formula**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{48 - (-36)}{7} + 1 \n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{48 + 36}{7} + 1 \n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{84}{7} + 1 \n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = 12 + 1 \n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = 13 \n\\]\n\n**Result:**\n\nAccording to this calculation, there are\u00a013\u00a0numbers in the list.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nWait, let me think. Does this make sense? The sequence starts at\u00a0-36\u00a0and ends at\u00a048, increasing by\u00a07\u00a0each time. If I count from\u00a0-36\u00a0to\u00a048 with\u00a07\u00a0increments, 13 seems reasonable.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nYes, it adds up. The formula approach confirms that there are\u00a013\u00a0terms.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Result**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure the correctness of my solution, I can do a quick verification by listing a few terms and checking if the pattern holds.\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\n- Start with\u00a0-36\n- Add\u00a07:\u00a0-36\u00a0+\u00a07\u00a0=\u00a0-29\n- Add\u00a07:\u00a0-29\u00a0+\u00a07\u00a0=\u00a0-22\n- Add\u00a07:\u00a0-22\u00a0+\u00a07\u00a0=\u00a0-15\n- Add\u00a07:\u00a0-15\u00a0+\u00a07\u00a0=\u00a0-8\n- Add\u00a07:\u00a0-8\u00a0+\u00a07\u00a0=\u00a0-1\n- Add\u00a07:\u00a0-1\u00a0+\u00a07\u00a0=\u00a06\n- Add\u00a07:\u00a06\u00a0+\u00a07\u00a0=\u00a013\n- Add\u00a07:\u00a013\u00a0+\u00a07\u00a0=\u00a020\n- Add\u00a07:\u00a020\u00a0+\u00a07\u00a0=\u00a027\n- Add\u00a07:\u00a027\u00a0+\u00a07\u00a0=\u00a034\n- Add\u00a07:\u00a034\u00a0+\u00a07\u00a0=\u00a041\n- Add\u00a07:\u00a041\u00a0+\u00a07\u00a0=\u00a048\n\n**Check:**\n\nStarting from\u00a0-36\u00a0and adding\u00a07\u00a0repeatedly leads to\u00a048\u00a0after\u00a013\u00a0steps. This matches our calculation using the formula.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis confirms that the number of terms is indeed\u00a013.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Considering Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Listing All Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThough I already verified with a partial list, I could list all the terms from\u00a0-36\u00a0to\u00a048\u00a0to ensure our formula method is correct.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1.\u00a0-36\n2.\u00a0-29\n3.\u00a0-22\n4.\u00a0-15\n5.\u00a0-8\n6.\u00a0-1\n7.\u00a06\n8.\u00a013\n9.\u00a020\n10.\u00a027\n11.\u00a034\n12.\u00a041\n13.\u00a048\n\n**Check:**\n\nCounting these, there are\u00a013\u00a0numbers.\n\n**Realization:**\n\nListing all terms confirms our previous methods. It's always good to double-check, especially when dealing with sequences.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis alternative approach aligns with our initial calculation, providing additional confidence in the correctness of the result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThroughout the process, I've used multiple strategies to approach the problem:\n1. **Checking for Constant Differences:** Confirmed the sequence is arithmetic.\n2. **Applying the Arithmetic Sequence Formula:** Calculated the number of terms to be\u00a013.\n3. **Verifying by Listing Terms:** Ensured the count aligns with the formula result.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEach method corroborates the others, which strengthens the validity of the solution. Initially brainstorming led to the correct approach, and continuously reflecting ensured accuracy at each step.\n\n**Possible Mistakes and Corrections:**\n\nInitially, I considered listing all terms but realized the arithmetic formula would be more efficient. Checking differences confirmed the sequence type, which was crucial for applying the correct formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThere are **13** numbers in the list\u00a0-36,\u00a0-29,\u00a0-22,\u00a0\u2026,\u00a041,\u00a048.\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step approach, complete with brainstorming, multiple strategy explorations, continuous checking, and reflections, has led us confidently to the correct answer.",
