    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, emulating a human thought process with brainstorming, reflections, checks, and even acknowledging potential missteps along the way. Here's how I would approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\nWhen I first see the question, I notice that it asks for the value of \\( f(0) + f(3) \\) given that \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{3x} + 2 \\). \n\n- **Instant Reaction:** \n   - This looks like a function evaluation problem. \n   - I\u2019ve dealt with square roots and linear functions before, so it seems straightforward but I should be careful with the square root part.\n   \n- **Uncertainty:** \n   - Wait, does \\( \\sqrt{3x} \\) mean I need to take the square root of \\( 3x \\), or is there something else at play? \n   - Should I simplify \\( \\sqrt{3x} \\) before substituting values? \n   \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n   - **Direct Substitution:** Substitute \\( 0 \\) and \\( 3 \\) into the function separately and then add the results.\n   - **Simplify First:** Maybe simplify \\( \\sqrt{3x} + 2 \\) before substituting to see if there's an easier way.\n   - **Check Domain:** Ensure that substituting \\( x = 3 \\) doesn\u2019t lead to any issues under the square root.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Direct Substitution**\n\n**Step 1: Evaluate \\( f(0) \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** \n   - Start with \\( x = 0 \\). \n   - Substituting directly into \\( f(x) \\): \\( f(0) = \\sqrt{3(0)} + 2 \\).\n   \n- **Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   f(0) = \\sqrt{0} + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2\n   \\]\n   \n- **Reflection:** \n   - That seems straightforward. \n   - \\( \\sqrt{0} \\) is definitely \\( 0 \\), so no issues there.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate \\( f(3) \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** \n   - Now, substitute \\( x = 3 \\) into the function.\n   - Need to calculate \\( \\sqrt{3 \\times 3} + 2 \\).\n   \n- **Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   f(3) = \\sqrt{9} + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5\n   \\]\n   \n- **Reflection:** \n   - This looks correct. \n   - \\( \\sqrt{9} \\) is \\( 3 \\), so adding \\( 2 \\) gives \\( 5 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Add \\( f(0) \\) and \\( f(3) \\)**\n\n- **Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   f(0) + f(3) = 2 + 5 = 7\n   \\]\n   \n- **Final Check:** \n   - Adding the two results makes sense. \n   - No obvious mistakes here.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Simplify First**\n\n**Thought Process:** \n- Even though the direct substitution worked, I wonder if simplifying the function before evaluating could provide any insights or catch potential errors.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify \\( f(x) \\)**\n\n- **Idea:** \n   - Factoring or simplifying \\( \\sqrt{3x} \\) might help, but \\( 3x \\) under the square root doesn\u2019t lend itself to factoring easily without involving \\( x \\).\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** \n   - Consider rewriting the function for clarity: \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{x} + 2 \\).\n   \n- **Reflection:** \n   - This doesn\u2019t seem to simplify the problem significantly. \n   - Maybe going back to direct substitution is better since the function is already straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:** \n- The initial strategy of direct substitution was efficient. \n- Simplifying didn\u2019t offer much advantage here.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Strategy Check: Domain Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:** \n- It\u2019s always good practice to check if the values being substituted are within the function\u2019s domain, especially with square roots.\n\n**Step 1: Check Domain for \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{3x} + 2 \\)**\n\n- **Requirement:** \n   - The expression inside the square root, \\( 3x \\), must be non-negative for real-valued outputs.\n\n- **For \\( x = 0 \\):** \n   \\[\n   3(0) = 0 \\quad (\\text{Valid})\n   \\]\n   \n- **For \\( x = 3 \\):** \n   \\[\n   3(3) = 9 \\quad (\\text{Valid})\n   \\]\n   \n- **Reflection:** \n   - Both \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 3 \\) fall within the domain where \\( 3x \\geq 0 \\).\n   - This confirms that the evaluations are valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and ensuring the function evaluations are correct and within the domain, the value is:\n\n\\[\nf(0) + f(3) = 2 + 5 = 7\n\\]\n\n### **Summary and Reflection**\n\n- **Initial Approach:** Direct substitution worked well for this problem.\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Attempting to simplify the function didn\u2019t provide much benefit.\n- **Domain Check:** Validated that both \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 3 \\) are within the function\u2019s domain, reinforcing that the solution is correct.\n- **Final Verifications:** Throughout the steps, quick checks ensured the calculations made sense, preventing potential errors.\n\nBy emulating a human thought process\u2014brainstorming, exploring various strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying along the way\u2014I confidently arrived at the correct solution.",
