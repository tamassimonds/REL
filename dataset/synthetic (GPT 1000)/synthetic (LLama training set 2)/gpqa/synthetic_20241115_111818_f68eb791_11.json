    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process step by step, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work as I go\u2014just like I would if I were solving this on my own.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question about the solubility of tricalcium phosphate (**Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082**) at different pH levels, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Solubility Product Constant (Ksp):** I know this relates to how much of **Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082** can dissolve in water to reach equilibrium. The lower the Ksp, the less soluble the compound is.\n\n2. **pH Influence:** pH affects the concentration of hydrogen ions (**H\u207a**) in the solution, which can influence the solubility of minerals, especially those with phosphate ions.\n\n3. **Dissociation Constants (Ka):** These are provided for phosphoric acid and may play a role in determining the equilibrium concentrations of various species in the solution.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how to connect these pieces right away. It's similar to problems involving common ion effect or complex ion formation, but this one also involves multiple dissociation steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n- **Strategy 1: Direct Ksp Calculation**\n  - Attempt to calculate the solubility using the Ksp expression directly for **Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082**.\n  - However, I realize that the pH might affect the phosphate ions' concentration, which complicates things.\n\n- **Strategy 2: Consider Phosphate Ion Equilibria**\n  - Given the **Ka** values for phosphoric acid, maybe I need to look at how **H\u207a** ions affect the concentration of **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** ions.\n  - This seems promising because if more **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** ions are present due to lower pH, solubility might increase.\n\n- **Strategy 3: Common Ion Effect**\n  - Previously learned that adding a common ion can decrease solubility due to the common ion effect.\n  - But here, pH adjustments might not directly introduce a common ion; instead, they affect the equilibrium of phosphate species.\n\nI'm leaning towards **Strategy 2**\u2014considering how pH and **Ka** values interact to influence phosphate concentrations. This seems more directly related to what's being asked.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Phosphate Ion Equilibria**\n\nLet's start by understanding how pH affects the concentration of phosphate ions:\n\n1. **Dissociation of Phosphoric Acid:**\n   - Phosphoric acid (**H\u2083PO\u2084**) has three dissociation steps with given **Ka** values:\n     - **First step:** \\( H_3PO_4 \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + H_2PO_4^- \\); \\( K_{a1} = 7.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\)\n     - **Second step:** \\( H_2PO_4^- \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + HPO_4^{2-} \\); \\( K_{a2} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\)\n     - **Third step:** \\( HPO_4^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + PO_4^{3-} \\); \\( K_{a3} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-12} \\)\n\n2. **Impact of pH:**\n   - **pH = 9:** The solution is basic, so the concentration of **H\u207a** ions is relatively low. This could favor the formation of **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** ions, potentially increasing the solubility of **Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082**.\n   - **pH = 7:** Neutral pH, so there's a balance between **H\u207a** and hydroxide (**OH\u207b**) ions. The effect on phosphate solubility might be moderate.\n   - **pH = 5:** The solution is acidic, meaning a higher concentration of **H\u207a** ions. This could lead to more **HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b** ions being present, which might decrease **Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082** solubility.\n\n3. **Equilibrium Considerations:**\n   - At higher pH, more **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** ions are available, potentially pushing the **Ksp** equilibrium of **Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082** to the right (more solubility).\n   - At lower pH, the increased **H\u207a** concentration could shift equilibria left, reducing the availability of **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b**, which might decrease solubility.\n\nI'm starting to think that I need to calculate the concentrations of different phosphate species at each pH level to see how they affect the solubility.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Phosphate Species at Different pH Levels**\n\n**pH = 9:**\n\n- **Given:** pH = 9, so \\( [H^+] = 1 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{M} \\).\n- **Assumption:** The solution is in equilibrium, and the phosphate species can shift according to the dissociation constants.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Using the Second Dissociation Constant \\(Ka_2\\):**\n   - \\( H_2PO_4^- \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + HPO_4^{2-} \\)\n   - \\( K_{a2} = \\frac{[H^+][HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]} \\)\n   \n   Rearranged to find \\( [HPO_4^{2-}] \\):\n   \\[\n   [HPO_4^{2-}] = \\frac{K_{a2} \\times [H_2PO_4^-]}{[H^+]} = \\frac{6.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\times [H_2PO_4^-]}{1 \\times 10^{-9}}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Using the Third Dissociation Constant \\(Ka_3\\):**\n   - \\( HPO_4^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + PO_4^{3-} \\)\n   - \\( K_{a3} = \\frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]} \\)\n   \n   Rearranged to find \\( [PO_4^{3-}] \\):\n   \\[\n   [PO_4^{3-}] = \\frac{K_{a3} \\times [HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H^+]} = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{-12} \\times [HPO_4^{2-}]}{1 \\times 10^{-9}}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Assuming Steady State:**\n   - Let's assume that the concentration of **H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b** ions doesn't change significantly, so \\( [H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b] \\approx 10^{-2} \\, \\text{M} \\) (a rough initial guess).\n   \n   But this is a **critical assumption**. If **H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b** is not at this concentration, our result will be off. However, without additional information, we'll proceed with this estimate.\n\n4. **Calculations:**\n   \n   Let's continue with our previous equations:\n   \n   \\[\n   [HPO_4^{2-}] = \\frac{6.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\times 1 \\times 10^{-2}}{1 \\times 10^{-9}} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   [PO_4^{3-}] = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{-12} \\times 6.2 \\times 10^{-7}}{1 \\times 10^{-9}} = 1.1 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{M}\n   \\]\n   \n   So, at **pH = 9**:\n   - \\( [HPO_4^{2-}] = 6.2 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M} \\)\n   - \\( [PO_4^{3-}] = 1.1 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{M} \\)\n   \n**pH = 7:**\n\n- **Given:** pH = 7, so \\( [H^+] = 1 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M} \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Using \\(Ka_2\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   [HPO_4^{2-}] = \\frac{6.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\times 1 \\times 10^{-2}}{1 \\times 10^{-7}} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{M}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Using \\(Ka_3\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   [PO_4^{3-}] = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{-12} \\times 6.2 \\times 10^{-6}}{1 \\times 10^{-7}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{M}\n   \\]\n   \nSo, at **pH = 7**:\n- \\( [HPO_4^{2-}] = 6.2 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{M} \\)\n- \\( [PO_4^{3-}] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{M} \\)\n   \n**pH = 5:**\n\n- **Given:** pH = 5, so \\( [H^+] = 1 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{M} \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Using \\(Ka_2\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   [HPO_4^{2-}] = \\frac{6.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\times 1 \\times 10^{-2}}{1 \\times 10^{-5}} = 6.2 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{M}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Using \\(Ka_3\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   [PO_4^{3-}] = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{-12} \\times 6.2 \\times 10^{-4}}{1 \\times 10^{-5}} = 1.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{M}\n   \\]\n   \nSo, at **pH = 5**:\n- \\( [HPO_4^{2-}] = 6.2 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{M} \\)\n- \\( [PO_4^{3-}] = 1.1 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{M} \\)\n   \n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating Solubility Using Ksp**\n\nNow that we have the concentrations of phosphate species at different pH levels, the next step is to see how these affect the solubility of **Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082** using its **Ksp**.\n\n**Ksp Expression for **Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082**:**\n\\[\nK_{sp} = [Ca^{2+}]^3 \\times [PO_4^{3-}]\n\\]\n   \nGiven \\( K_{sp} = 2 \\times 10^{-29} \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n   \n- At equilibrium, the product of the calcium ion concentration cubed and the phosphate ion concentration will equal the **Ksp**.\n- However, in our case, **Ca\u00b2\u207a** ions are not mentioned, which suggests that their concentration might be in excess or that the problem is simplified to focus on **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** ions' effect.\n- This is a bit confusing because typically, we'd need **Ca\u00b2\u207a** concentrations to apply the **Ksp** directly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n   \n- Wait a minute. If we're considering **Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082** solubility, shouldn't **Ca\u00b2\u207a** concentrations be part of the equation?\n   \n- Maybe the problem assumes a constant **Ca\u00b2\u207a** concentration or that it's in excess, simplifying the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the sample solution provides **Ca\u00b2\u207a** concentrations as part of their solubility values.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n   \n- Since **Ca\u00b2\u207a** concentrations are not provided, let's consider that at different pH levels, the solubility changes primarily due to **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** ion concentration adjustments.\n\n- Another possibility is that the **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** concentration affects the **overall solubility product (Ksp)** balance, but without knowing **Ca\u00b2\u207a** concentrations, it's challenging to apply **Ksp** directly.\n\n**Decision:**\n   \nGiven the lack of **Ca\u00b2\u207a** concentration data, I'll proceed by checking the equilibrium expressions based on the solubility constants provided and see if I can relate **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** concentrations to **Ksp** adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Assumptions and Simplifications**\n\n**Assumption:**\n   \n- Let's assume that at each pH level, the solubility equilibrium primarily depends on **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** concentrations, and **Ca\u00b2\u207a** is in excess or remains constant.\n\n**Simplification:**\n   \n- Instead of calculating exact **Ca\u00b2\u207a** concentrations, we'll focus on how varying **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** concentrations affect the apparent solubility.\n\n- This approach aligns with understanding how pH influences solubility through the common ion effect or similar mechanisms.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n   \n- **Ca\u00b2\u207a** concentrations could significantly impact the **Ksp** if they vary, which our approach does not account for.\n\n- If neglecting **Ca\u00b2\u207a** leads to significant errors, this method might be flawed.\n\n**Reflection:**\n   \n- Hmm, neglecting **Ca\u00b2\u207a** might not be ideal, but without additional data, this is the best path forward.\n\n- Alternatively, the problem might be designed to focus solely on **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** adjustments.\n\n**Check:**\n   \n- Quick check: Does it make sense that **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** concentrations alone could dictate solubility adjustments?\n\n- Yes, higher **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** concentrations would shift the equilibrium to dissolve more **Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082**, increasing solubility, while lower concentrations would decrease solubility.\n\n- However, the exact relationship with **Ksp** remains uncertain without knowing **Ca\u00b2\u207a** concentrations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating Solubility Adjustments Based on PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b Concentrations**\n\nEven without exact **Ca\u00b2\u207a** concentrations, I can hypothesize how changes in **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** affect **Ksp** balance and thus the apparent solubility.\n\n**Let's differentiate between pH levels:**\n\n**pH = 9:** \n   \n- Higher **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** concentration (**1.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 M**)\n   \n- Likely favorable for increased solubility.\n\n**pH = 7:**\n   \n- Moderate **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** concentration (**1.0 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b9 M**)\n   \n- Balanced solubility.\n\n**pH = 5:**\n   \n- Lower **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** concentration (**1.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079 M**)\n   \n- Likely to reduce solubility.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. **Proportional Changes:**\n   \n   - Assume that the changes in **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** concentrations proportionally affect the solubility.\n\n2. **Ksp Adjustments:**\n   \n   - Let's say that at **pH = 7**, the solubility aligns with the **Ksp** condition.\n   \n   - At **pH = 9**, the increased **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** concentration pushes the equilibrium to dissolve more solid, increasing solubility.\n   \n   - At **pH = 5**, the decreased **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** concentration shifts the equilibrium to favor less dissolution, decreasing solubility.\n\n3. **Quantifying the Relationship:**\n   \n   - This is still quite qualitative without specific **Ca\u00b2\u207a** concentrations.\n   \n   - However, the trend seems logical: higher pH increases solubility, while lower pH decreases it.\n\n**Reflection:**\n   \n- But wait, can I numerically quantify this without **Ca\u00b2\u207a** data? Probably not precisely.\n\n- Does this qualitative analysis align with the given options? Let's see.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n   \n- Maybe instead of expecting precise calculations, the problem is asking for qualitative trends that can be matched with the provided options.\n\n- This realization leads me to think that I might need to approach the problem differently\u2014perhaps look for a pattern or use given **Ksp** data with assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Looking for Patterns in Provided Options**\n\n**Given Options:**\n\n(A) 1.54x10\u207b\u2075 M; 1.42x10\u207b\u2074; 4.67x10\u207b\u00b3\n\n(B) 1.96x10\u207b\u2075; 1.35x10\u207b\u2074; 4.37x10\u207b\u00b3\n\n(C) 1.67x10\u207b\u2075; 1.51x10\u207b\u2074; 4.81x10\u207b\u00b3\n\n(D) 1.43x10\u207b\u2075; 1.29x10\u207b\u2074; 4.58x10\u207b\u00b3\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Wait, I realize options are provided as specific concentrations corresponding to each pH level. This suggests that there's a specific numerical relationship or calculation involving **Ksp**, **Ka**, and pH that I haven't fully explored yet.\n\n- Perhaps I need to re-examine how **Ka** and **Ksp** relate to the solubility of **Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082**.\n\n- This moment of doubt signals that my previous approach might be missing a critical part of the solution.\n\n**Reflections:**\n\n- The options provide specific solubility values at different pH levels, which seems more quantitative than my qualitative approach.\n\n- This suggests that a numerical method involving **Ksp** and **Ka** values is needed to derive these solubility levels.\n\n- Maybe I need to consider complex equilibria involving all dissociation steps and how they interconnect with **Ksp**.\n\n**Decision:**\n\n- To proceed, I'll attempt to connect **Ka** and **Ksp** to find a more numerical solution.\n\n- This might involve setting up equilibrium expressions that account for all dissociation steps and how they affect **Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082** solubility.\n\n*Creating a New Strategy*\n\n- **New Strategy:** Use **Ka** values to express **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** concentrations in terms of the initial acid concentration and then relate these to **Ksp**.\n\n- **Reflection:** This approach seems more aligned with solving for specific solubility values at given pH levels.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Connecting Ka and Ksp to Calculate Solubility**\n\nLet's explore how **Ka** values can be used to calculate solubility at different pH levels.\n\n**Understanding the Relationships:**\n\n1. **Dissociation Steps:** Each step of phosphoric acid dissociation is governed by a **Ka** value.\n   \n2. **pH Impact:** pH levels determine the concentration of **H\u207a** ions, which influence the equilibrium positions of phosphate species.\n\n3. **Ksp Dependency:** The solubility of **Ca\u2083(PO\u2084)\u2082** depends on the concentration of **PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b** ions, which are affected by pH.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n**Assumption:** Let's assume that the initial concentration of phosphoric acid (**H\u2083PO\u2084**) is **1 M** (or another suitable value), but since we're dealing with ratios, the exact concentration can be factored out later.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Equilibrium Concentrations of Phosphate Species**\n\n   -
