    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and make sure to check my work along the way. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the question:\n\n**How many positive integers \\( t \\) will make the expression \\( \\frac{19}{t} + \\frac{5}{t} \\) have an integral value?**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a fraction problem where the sum of two fractions needs to be an integer. It reminds me of problems where you have to find integer values for denominators to make fractions whole numbers.\n- **Similar Problems:** I\u2019ve seen problems where you set fractions equal to integers and solve for the denominator. Maybe I can use something similar here.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Combine the Fractions:** Simplify \\( \\frac{19}{t} + \\frac{5}{t} \\) into a single fraction and see what conditions make it an integer.\n  2. **Common Denominator Approach:** Find a common denominator and analyze when the numerator is divisible by that denominator.\n  3. **Test Different Values of \\( t \\):** Start testing small positive integers to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nI'm not entirely sure which approach will be the best right off the bat, so I think exploring a few different strategies is a good start.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Combine the Fractions**\n\n**Step 1:** Attempt to simplify the expression.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{19}{t} + \\frac{5}{t} = \\frac{19 + 5}{t} = \\frac{24}{t}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, simplifying makes it much easier! Now, the expression is just \\( \\frac{24}{t} \\). This tells me that for the entire expression to be an integer, \\( t \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\n- **Thought Process:** So, we're looking for positive integers \\( t \\) that divide 24 evenly. This simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n**Step 2:** List the divisors of 24.\n\n\\[\n24 = 2^3 \\times 3^1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Divisors: } 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n\\]\n\n**Check:** \n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, because if \\( t \\) is a divisor of 24, \\( \\frac{24}{t} \\) will always be an integer.\n- **Cross-Verification:** Let\u2019s quickly verify by substituting a few divisors back into the original expression:\n  - For \\( t = 1 \\): \\( \\frac{24}{1} = 24 \\) (integer)\n  - For \\( t = 2 \\): \\( \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\) (integer)\n  - For \\( t = 3 \\): \\( \\frac{24}{3} = 8 \\) (integer)\n  - ... and so on.\n\nEverything checks out. But let me also consider other strategies to ensure this is the most efficient approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Common Denominator Approach**\n\n**Step 3:** Re-examine the original expression to see if there's another way to find \\( t \\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{19}{t} + \\frac{5}{t} = \\frac{19 + 5}{t} = \\frac{24}{t}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This is essentially the same as Strategy 1. Combining the fractions immediately leads to \\( \\frac{24}{t} \\), which simplifies the problem to finding the divisors of 24.\n\n- **Insight:** So, combining the fractions was indeed the right first step. It confirmed that looking for divisors was the correct path.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does it align with Strategy 1?** Yes, both strategies converge to the same simplification.\n- **Is there anything new here?** Not really, but it reinforces that identifying \\( t \\) as a divisor of 24 is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Testing Different Values of \\( t \\)**\n\n**Step 4:** Instead of listing all divisors, let's test a few small positive integers to see if they work.\n\n- **Testing \\( t = 1 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{24}{1} = 24 \\quad (\\text{Integer})\n  \\]\n  \n- **Testing \\( t = 2 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{24}{2} = 12 \\quad (\\text{Integer})\n  \\]\n  \n- **Testing \\( t = 3 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{24}{3} = 8 \\quad (\\text{Integer})\n  \\]\n  \n- **Testing \\( t = 4 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{24}{4} = 6 \\quad (\\text{Integer})\n  \\]\n  \n- **Testing \\( t = 5 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{24}{5} = 4.8 \\quad (\\text{Not Integer})\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:** \n\n- **Wait, \\( t = 5 \\) doesn't work.** This reinforces that only the divisors of 24 will make the expression an integer. Testing values outside the divisors confirms that non-divisor values lead to non-integer results.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does this confirm our earlier conclusion?** Yes, testing supports that only divisors of 24 make the expression integral.\n- **Is there a pattern?** Only those \\( t \\) where \\( t \\) divides 24 evenly result in an integer value for the expression.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Step 5:** Sum up all the positive integer values of \\( t \\) that work.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Divisors of 24: } 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n\\]\n\n- **Total Count:** There are 8 positive integers \\( t \\) that make \\( \\frac{24}{t} \\) an integer.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this seem correct?** Yes, all listed divisors result in integral values for the expression.\n- **Cross-Verification:** All strategies led to the same conclusion, and testing specific values confirmed it.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Did brainstorming help?** Absolutely. Starting with different strategies and seeing which one simplifies the problem made it clearer.\n- **Importance of Checking:** Testing specific values helped confirm that only divisors of 24 work, reinforcing the initial simplification.\n- **Learning Moment:** Sometimes, simplifying the problem early on leads to a straightforward path to the solution.\n\nBy thinking through each step, exploring various strategies, and constantly checking my work, I was able to confidently arrive at the answer.",

  "ground_truth": "We can simplify $\\frac{19}{t}+\\frac{5}{t}$ as $\\frac{19+5}{t}$, or $\\frac{24}{t}$. So, in order for this expression to have an integral value, 24 must be divisible by $t$. In other words, $t$ must be a factor of 24. Therefore, to find the number of positive integers $t$ that will make the expression have an integral value, we just need to find the number of factors of 24. We know that if $ n ={p_{1}}^{e_{1}}\\cdot{p_{2}}^{e_{2}}\\cdot{p_{3}}^{e_{3}}\\cdots{p_{k}}^{e_{k}} $, where $p_1, p_2...p_k$ are prime numbers, then the number of factors of $n$ is equal to $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)(e_3+1)\\cdots(e_k+1)$. We have that the prime factorization of 24 is $2^3\\cdot3^1$, so using the formula above, 24 has $(3+1)(1+1)=\\boxed{8}$ factors."
