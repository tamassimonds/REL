    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were tackling it myself.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{12x^4 + 4x^3 + 9x^2 + 5x + 3}{3x^4 + 2x^3 + 8x^2 + 3x + 1} \\]\n\nI recognize that we're dealing with a **rational function**\u2014a ratio of two polynomials. The question asks for the value of \\( y \\) at which there's a **horizontal asymptote**. \n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Asymptotes and Rational Functions:** I remember that horizontal asymptotes relate to the behavior of the function as \\( x \\) approaches infinity or negative infinity. Specifically, they depend on the degrees of the numerator and denominator polynomials.\n- **Degrees of Polynomials:** Both the numerator and denominator have the highest power of \\( x \\) as 4, which makes me think about the rules for horizontal asymptotes when the degrees are equal.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Perhaps I could simplify the function, or maybe directly analyze the degrees. Another approach might be to evaluate limits as \\( x \\) approaches infinity.\n\nAt this point, I feel inclined to start by examining the degrees of the polynomials to see what that tells me about the horizontal asymptote.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing the Degrees of Polynomials**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The **degree** of a polynomial is the highest exponent of \\( x \\) in it.\n- In both the numerator and denominator, the highest exponent is 4.\n- I recall that when the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This seems like a straightforward path. If the degrees are equal, calculating the ratio of leading coefficients should give me the \\( y \\)-value of the horizontal asymptote.\n\n**Action:**\n- I'll identify the leading coefficients in both the numerator and denominator.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Numerator:** \\( 12x^4 + 4x^3 + 9x^2 + 5x + 3 \\)\n  - Leading coefficient: \\( 12 \\)\n- **Denominator:** \\( 3x^4 + 2x^3 + 8x^2 + 3x + 1 \\)\n  - Leading coefficient: \\( 3 \\)\n\n\\[ \\text{Horizontal Asymptote: } y = \\frac{\\text{leading coefficient of numerator}}{\\text{leading coefficient of denominator}} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4 \\]\n\n**Natural Check:**\n- Wait, that makes sense because when degrees are equal, the function approaches the ratio of the leading coefficients as \\( x \\) goes to infinity or negative infinity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Approach by Simplifying the Function**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To ensure my answer is correct, it might be helpful to see if simplifying the function leads to the same result or if there's another method that confirms it.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Though analyzing degrees seems sufficient, simplifying could provide additional insight. If both methods align, it strengthens the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Action:**\n- Attempt to divide the numerator by the denominator to see if the horizontal asymptote can be identified through simplification.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **Long Division of Polynomials:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{r|l}\n   3x^4 + 2x^3 + 8x^2 + 3x + 1 & 12x^4 + 4x^3 + 9x^2 + 5x + 3 \\\\\n   \\hline\n   & 4 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n   \n   - Multiply \\( 4 \\) by the entire denominator:\n     \n     \\[\n     4 \\times (3x^4 + 2x^3 + 8x^2 + 3x + 1) = 12x^4 + 8x^3 + 32x^2 + 12x + 4\n     \\]\n   \n   - Subtract this from the numerator:\n     \n     \\[\n     (12x^4 + 4x^3 + 9x^2 + 5x + 3) - (12x^4 + 8x^3 + 32x^2 + 12x + 4) = -4x^3 - 23x^2 - 7x - 1\n     \\]\n   \n   - Remainder: \n     \n     \\[\n     -4x^3 - 23x^2 - 7x - 1\n     \\]\n   \n   - So, \n     \n     \\[\n     y = 4 + \\frac{-4x^3 - 23x^2 - 7x - 1}{3x^4 + 2x^3 + 8x^2 + 3x + 1}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Analyzing the Remainder:**\n   - As \\( x \\) approaches infinity, the remainder term \n     \n     \\[\n     \\frac{-4x^3 - 23x^2 - 7x - 1}{3x^4 + 2x^3 + 8x^2 + 3x + 1}\n     \\]\n     tends to zero because the numerator's highest power of \\( x \\) is lower than the denominator's.\n\n**Natural Check:**\n- This aligns with my earlier conclusion. The \\( y \\)-value approaches 4 as \\( x \\) goes to infinity, confirming the horizontal asymptote.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Alternative Approach - Evaluating Limits**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Another way to determine horizontal asymptotes is by evaluating the limit of \\( y \\) as \\( x \\) approaches infinity or negative infinity.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This method should yield the same result if the degrees and leading coefficients are correctly analyzed.\n\n**Action:**\n- Calculate the limit of \\( y \\) as \\( x \\) approaches infinity.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{12x^4 + 4x^3 + 9x^2 + 5x + 3}{3x^4 + 2x^3 + 8x^2 + 3x + 1}\n\\]\n- **Dividing Numerator and Denominator by \\( x^4 \\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{12 + \\frac{4}{x} + \\frac{9}{x^2} + \\frac{5}{x^3} + \\frac{3}{x^4}}{3 + \\frac{2}{x} + \\frac{8}{x^2} + \\frac{3}{x^3} + \\frac{1}{x^4}}\n  \\]\n- **As \\( x \\) Approaches Infinity:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{12 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0}{3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0} = \\frac{12}{3} = 4\n  \\]\n\n**Natural Check:**\n- This confirms the horizontal asymptote is at \\( y = 4 \\), aligning with all previous methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies\u2014analyzing polynomial degrees, simplifying the function through long division, and evaluating limits as \\( x \\) approaches infinity\u2014all approaches consistently lead to the same conclusion:\n\n**The value of \\( y \\) at which there is a horizontal asymptote is:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Initial Approach:** Started by examining polynomial degrees, recalling the rule for horizontal asymptotes when degrees are equal.\n- **Verification Step:** Simplified the function through polynomial long division, confirming the result.\n- **Alternative Method:** Evaluated the limit as \\( x \\) approaches infinity, providing additional confirmation.\n- **Reflection Throughout:** Checked each step's correctness, ensuring consistency across different methods.\n\nThis step-by-step exploration ensured a robust understanding and verification of the solution, leading confidently to the correct answer.",

  "ground_truth": "For a rational function, if the degree of the polynomial in the numerator is the same as the degree of the polynomial in the denominator, there is a horizontal asymptote at the $y$-value that equals the ratio of the leading coefficient of the numerator to the leading coefficient of the denominator.
