    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll explore different strategies, reflect on their effectiveness, and adjust my approach as needed, just like I would when solving a problem manually.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n- **Understanding the Question:** We need to find a matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) that, when multiplied by another matrix \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}\\), triples the second row. So, the result should be \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 3c & 3d \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:**\n  - This reminds me of linear transformations and how matrices can scale vectors.\n  - Maybe \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) needs to be a transformation matrix that only affects the second row of the input matrix.\n  - I recall that multiplying matrices row by row can achieve targeted transformations, but I'm not entirely sure how to set that up here.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Identity Matrix with Modifications:** Start with the identity matrix and modify it to scale the second row.\n  2. **Row Operation Approach:** Think about how elementary row operations work and see if that applies here.\n  3. **Matrix Equation Setup:** Set up an equation based on matrix multiplication rules to solve for \\(\\mathbf{M}\\).\n\nAt this point, the idea of using an identity matrix and modifying it seems the most straightforward, but I'm not entirely confident. Let's explore each strategy to see which one works best.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Identity Matrix with Modifications**\n\n- **Recap of Idea:** Use the identity matrix \\(\\mathbf{I} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and modify it to scale the second row by 3.\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - **Matrix Multiplication Insight:** Multiplying by an identity matrix leaves vectors unchanged. To triple the second row, I need to introduce a factor of 3 in the matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\).\n  - **Proposed \\(\\mathbf{M}\\):** Perhaps \\(\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n- **Checking This Approach:**\n  - Multiply \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) by the input matrix:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{M} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 3c & 3d \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\]\n  - **Reflection:** This works perfectly! The first row remains unchanged, and the second row is tripled as required.\n\n- **Conclusion:** This strategy seems effective. \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) can be \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\). \n\n### **Exploring Alternative Strategies to Validate**\n\nEven though the first strategy worked, it's good to double-check using a different method to ensure correctness.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Row Operation Approach**\n\n- **Understanding Row Operations:** Elementary row operations can scale rows in a matrix. Maybe thinking about how to apply such an operation can help configure \\(\\mathbf{M}\\).\n\n- **Applying the Concept:**\n  - To triple the second row, \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) needs to scale the second row of the input matrix by 3 while leaving the first row unchanged.\n\n- **Matrix Setup:**\n  - \\(\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} m_{11} & m_{12} \\\\ m_{21} & m_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n  - Write the equation based on desired output:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    m_{11} & m_{12} \\\\\n    m_{21} & m_{22}\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    a & b \\\\\n    c & d\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    a & b \\\\\n    3c & 3d\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n- **Breaking It Down:**\n  - **First Row:** \n    \\[\n    m_{11} \\cdot a + m_{12} \\cdot c = a \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m_{11} = 1, \\; m_{12} = 0\n    \\]\n  - **Second Row:** \n    \\[\n    m_{21} \\cdot a + m_{22} \\cdot c = 3c \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m_{21} = 0, \\; m_{22} = 3\n    \\]\n\n- **Resulting \\(\\mathbf{M}\\):**\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 3\n  \\end{pmatrix}\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This approach reaffirms our initial strategy. The calculations align perfectly with the desired outcome.\n\n### **Checking the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's verify if \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) indeed satisfies the condition:\n\n1. **Multiply \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) by Input Matrix:**\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{M} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 3c & 3d \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n2. **Compare with Desired Output:** \n   \\[\n   \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 3c & 3d \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n   \n   - **Match:** The output matches exactly what was required.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Reflection:** Initially, I thought about using the identity matrix as a base and modifying it. After verifying with another method, I confirm that \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) is indeed \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\). It applies the necessary scaling to the second row while leaving the first row unchanged.\n\n- **Final Answer:** \n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 3\n  \\end{pmatrix}\n  \\]\n\n- **Mistake Check:** At no point did I encounter a scenario where no such \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) existed. Both strategies led to the same solution, confirming its validity.\n\n- **Conclusion:** By exploring multiple strategies and validating the solution through different approaches, I've ensured that the matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) correctly fulfills the requirement of tripling the second row of the input matrix.",
