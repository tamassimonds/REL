    "working_out": "# First Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see the problem **\"How many perfect cubes are between 100 and 900?\"**, I'm reminded of basic exponentiation and integer powers. Perfect cubes are numbers that can be expressed as \\( n^3 \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- I think about listing out cubes of integers to see which ones fall within the range of 100 to 900.\n- Alternatively, I could determine the smallest and largest integers whose cubes fit within this range and then calculate accordingly.\n- There's also the possibility of checking each number between 100 and 900 to see if it's a perfect cube, but that seems inefficient.\n  \nHonestly, the idea of listing cubes seems straightforward, but I wonder if there's a more mathematical approach that could save time, especially for larger ranges.\n\n# Exploring Strategies\n\n**Strategy 1: List Perfect Cubes Manually**\n- Start with \\( n = 1 \\) and compute \\( n^3 \\) until exceeding 900.\n- Check which of these cubes fall between 100 and 900.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n- This could get tedious if I need to compute many cubes.\n- I might miss some cubes if I'm not careful with my calculations.\n\n**Strategy 2: Use Inequalities to Find Bounds**\n- Set up inequalities to find the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( n^3 \\geq 100 \\) and the largest \\( n \\) where \\( n^3 \\leq 900 \\).\n- This seems more efficient because it narrows down the range without listing all cubes.\n\n**Strategy 3: Check Each Number in the Range**\n- Iterate through each number between 100 and 900 to see if it's a perfect cube.\n  \n**Potential Issues:**\n- This method seems the least efficient because it requires checking 800+ numbers individually.\n\nReflecting on these strategies, **Strategy 2** (Using Inequalities) appears to be the most efficient. It minimizes calculations by directly finding the bounds for \\( n \\) rather than computing multiple cubes or checking each number individually.\n\n# Implementing Strategy 2: Use Inequalities\n\n**Step 1: Find the Lower Bound**\n\nI need to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^3 \\geq 100 \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- I remember that \\( n = 4 \\) gives \\( 4^3 = 64 \\), which is less than 100.\n- Let's try \\( n = 5 \\): \\( 5^3 = 125 \\), which is greater than 100.\n- So, \\( n = 5 \\) is the smallest integer where the cube is at least 100.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, let me quickly verify: \\( 5^3 = 125 \\) and \\( 4^3 = 64 \\). Since 125 is greater than 100 and 64 is less than 100, \\( n = 5 \\) makes sense.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Upper Bound**\n\nNow, I need to find the largest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^3 \\leq 900 \\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- I recall that \\( n = 9 \\) gives \\( 9^3 = 729 \\), which is within the range.\n- Let's check \\( n = 10 \\): \\( 10^3 = 1000 \\), which exceeds 900.\n- Therefore, \\( n = 9 \\) is the largest integer where the cube is at most 900.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Quick check: \\( 9^3 = 729 \\) is less than 900 and \\( 10^3 = 1000 \\) is greater than 900. So, \\( n = 9 \\) is correct.\n\n# Counting the Perfect Cubes\n\nNow that I have the range \\( n = 5 \\) to \\( n = 9 \\), I can list the perfect cubes within this range:\n\n- \\( 5^3 = 125 \\)\n- \\( 6^3 = 216 \\)\n- \\( 7^3 = 343 \\)\n- \\( 8^3 = 512 \\)\n- \\( 9^3 = 729 \\)\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- There are five integers (5 through 9) whose cubes fall between 100 and 900.\n- This seems reasonable, but let me double-check by listing the cubes to ensure none are missed.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Listing them out: 125, 216, 343, 512, 729 \u2014 all are within the range 100 to 900.\n- No cubes are repeated or missing.\n\n# Final Check\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- The smallest cube in this range is \\( 125 \\), which is \\( 5^3 \\).\n- The largest cube is \\( 729 \\), which is \\( 9^3 \\).\n- Both are within the specified range of 100 to 900.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**\n- Given that the calculations align with the definitions of perfect cubes, and the cubes listed are within the desired range, I am confident in the result.\n- There's no need for further adjustments or alternative methods at this point.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully exploring different strategies and verifying each step, I conclude that **there are five perfect cubes between 100 and 900**:\n\n- \\( 125 \\) (from \\( 5^3 \\))\n- \\( 216 \\) (from \\( 6^3 \\))\n- \\( 343 \\) (from \\( 7^3 \\))\n- \\( 512 \\) (from \\( 8^3 \\))\n- \\( 729 \\) (from \\( 9^3 \\))\n\nThis approach ensured that I accurately identified the range of integers whose cubes fit within the specified bounds, leading to a complete and correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The smallest perfect cube inside this range is $5^3 = 125$ since $4^3 = 64.$  As for the highest cube, we know that $10^3 = 1000,$ which is outside the range, so we try $9^3 = 729.$  Therefore the cubes in question are $5^3,6^3,7^3,8^3,9^3$.  So there are $\\boxed{5}$ such cubes."
