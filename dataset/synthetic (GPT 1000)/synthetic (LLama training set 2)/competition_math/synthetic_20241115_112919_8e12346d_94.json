    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving the fraction \\(\\frac{16}{20}\\) step-by-step. I'll approach it like I would if I were working through it myself, making sure to brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether I'm on the right track, and check my work along the way.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWhen I first see the fraction \\(\\frac{16}{20}\\), my immediate reaction is that it looks like a typical fraction that can be simplified. Fractions like this often involve finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator to reduce it to its simplest form.\n\nBut before jumping in, I recall that there might be several ways to approach this:\n\n1. **Finding the GCD:** This is the most straightforward method\u2014identify the largest number that divides both 16 and 20 without leaving a remainder.\n   \n2. **Prime Factorization:** Break down both numbers into their prime factors to see common factors.\n   \n3. **Dividing by Common Factors:** Start dividing both the numerator and denominator by common factors until you can\u2019t simplify anymore.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nLet\u2019s explore these strategies:\n\n- **First Attempt: Finding the GCD**\n  - My initial thought is to find the GCD of 16 and 20. This seems the most direct.\n  \n- **Second Attempt: Prime Factorization**\n  - If the GCD method doesn\u2019t feel clear, I could factor both numbers to see their primes and identify common factors.\n\n- **Third Attempt: Sequential Simplification**\n  - Another way is to divide both numerator and denominator by their common factors step by step.\n\n### **Exploring the First Strategy: Finding the GCD**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the GCD method:\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 16 and 20**\n\n- **Reflection:** To find the GCD, I need to think about what numbers divide both 16 and 20 evenly.\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  - Divisors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16\n  - Divisors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20\n  - Common divisors: 1, 2, 4\n  \n- **Thought Process:** The largest common divisor is 4. So, the GCD of 16 and 20 is 4.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction Using the GCD**\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16 \\div 4}{20 \\div 4} = \\frac{4}{5}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** Does \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) make sense? Let\u2019s see if both numerator and denominator were divided by their GCD:\n\n  - \\(16 \\div 4 = 4\\)\n  - \\(20 \\div 4 = 5\\)\n\n- **Reflection:** Yes, dividing by the GCD worked perfectly. The fraction simplifies to \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\).\n\n### **Checking the First Approach**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) reduce further? No, because 4 and 5 have no common factors other than 1.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** The GCD method seems correct and efficient for this problem.\n\n### **Exploring the Second Strategy: Prime Factorization**\n\nJust to ensure the first method is correct, let\u2019s try prime factorization.\n\n**Step 1: Factor 16 and 20 into Primes**\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - 16 = \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4\\)\n  - 20 = \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 2^2 \\times 5\\)\n\n- **Reflection:** So, both numbers share \\(2^2\\) as a common factor.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Fraction Using Prime Factors**\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{2^4}{2^2 \\times 5} = \\frac{2^{4-2}}{5} = \\frac{2^2}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** This also leads to \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\).\n\n### **Verifying the Second Approach**\n\n- **Quick Check:** The prime factorization method also gives \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\), confirming that the GCD method was correct.\n\n### **Exploring the Third Strategy: Sequential Simplification**\n\nFinally, let\u2019s attempt sequential simplification to see if we arrive at the same answer.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify by Common Factors**\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - Divide both by 2:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{16 \\div 2}{20 \\div 2} = \\frac{8}{10}\n    \\]\n    \n  - Simplify \\(\\frac{8}{10}\\) by dividing by 2 again:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{8 \\div 2}{10 \\div 2} = \\frac{4}{5}\n    \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** This method involves dividing by common factors step-by-step and also leads to \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\).\n\n### **Checking the Third Approach**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Starting with \\(\\frac{16}{20}\\), dividing by 2 twice still confirms that the simplified fraction is \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\).\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring three different strategies\u2014finding the GCD, prime factorization, and sequential simplification\u2014all methods consistently lead to the same simplified fraction: \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\).\n\n- **Does the Answer Make Sense?** Yes, \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) cannot be simplified further because 4 and 5 have no common factors other than 1.\n\n- **Final Check:** All approaches converge to the same solution, confirming the correctness of the simplification.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\frac{16}{20} = \\frac{4}{5}\\)\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThroughout this problem, I:\n\n1. **Brainstormed Different Strategies:** Considered finding the GCD, using prime factorization, and sequential simplification.\n  \n2. **Explored Each Method:** Applied the GCD method first, then verified using prime factorization, and finally used sequential simplification to ensure consistency.\n   \n3. **Reflected and Checked My Work:** Continuously checked if each approach led to the correct answer and confirmed that \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) was indeed the simplest form.\n\nBy thinking through it step-by-step and being open to trying different methods, I ensured a thorough and accurate simplification of the fraction \\(\\frac{16}{20}\\).",
