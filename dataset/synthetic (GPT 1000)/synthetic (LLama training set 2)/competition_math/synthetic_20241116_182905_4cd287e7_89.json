    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through each part as naturally as possible\u2014much like how I would approach it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on what's working (or not), and check my progress frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- The question asks for the **equation of the directrix** of the parabola given by \\( y = 8x^2 + 2 \\).\n- Directrices are specific lines associated with parabolas that play a crucial role in their definition.\n- **Wait a minute...** I remember that in parabolas, the directrix is related to the focal point and the axis of symmetry. But let me think if there's a direct formula I can recall.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Option 1:** Recall the standard forms of parabolas and how the directrix is defined within those.\n- **Option 2:** Complete the square to rewrite the equation in a more recognizable form.\n- **Option 3:** Use geometric properties or definitions related to parabolas and their directrices.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Standard Forms:** Parabolas can be oriented differently (opening upwards, downwards, left, right). Identifying which form corresponds to the given equation might help.\n  \n  - For example, the standard form for a parabola that opens upwards is \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex.\n  \n- **Completing the Square:** This method often helps in transforming quadratic equations into their standard form, making it easier to identify key characteristics like the vertex and directrix.\n  \n  - **Hmm**, I haven't used completing the square in a while... but it might be helpful here to get the equation into a more familiar format.\n  \n- **Geometric Definitions:** Understanding the relationship between the parabola, its focus, and the directrix could provide insights.\n  \n  - **Oh!** I recall that the directrix is a fixed line, and the parabola is the set of all points equidistant from the focus and the directrix. But applying this definition directly might be tricky without more information.\n  \n**Checking the Approach:**\n\n- Does starting with standard forms make sense? **Yes**, because it helps clarify the parabola's orientation and properties.\n- Is completing the square a viable option? **Maybe**, especially if it simplifies the equation.\n- Do I have enough information to use geometric definitions directly? **Not yet**, I need to identify the vertex and focus first.\n\n**Conclusion:** Let's proceed by trying to rewrite the given equation in a standard form. If that doesn't work, I can revisit my strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Rewriting the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The given equation is \\( y = 8x^2 + 2 \\).\n- **Wait, let me check**... this looks like a quadratic equation in \\( x \\), with \\( y \\) as the dependent variable.\n- To identify the directrix, it's helpful to compare it with the standard form of a parabola that opens upwards.\n\n**Attempting to Match with Standard Form:**\n\n- The standard form for a parabola that opens upwards is \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\).\n- **Hmm**, the given equation is \\( y = 8x^2 + 2 \\), which can be seen as \\( y = 8(x - 0)^2 + 2 \\). So, \\( h = 0 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\).\n\n**Completing the Square:**\n\n- **Wait a moment,** the equation is already in a form similar to the standard one without needing to complete the square.\n- **Is this correct?** Let's verify:\n\n  - Given: \\( y = 8x^2 + 2 \\)\n  - Compare with: \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\)\n    - Here, \\( a = 8 \\), \\( h = 0 \\), and \\( k = 2 \\)\n\n- **Reflection:** It seems **I don't** actually need to complete the square since the equation is already aligned with the standard form.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Finalized Form:** \\( y = 8(x - 0)^2 + 2 \\)\n- **Vertex Identified:** \\((h, k) = (0, 2)\\)\n- **Realization:** This matches the standard form, so I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying the Vertex and Focal Point**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- From the standard form, the **vertex** is at \\((h, k) = (0, 2)\\).\n- **But what about the focus?** I need to know the distance from the vertex to the focus to determine the directrix.\n\n**Recalling Parabola Properties:**\n\n- For parabolas that open upwards, the focus is located at \\((h, k + \\frac{1}{4p})\\), where \\(p\\) is the distance from the vertex to the focus.\n- **Wait, I need to find \\(p\\)**. But how?\n\n**Finding \\(p\\):**\n\n- The general form of a parabola is \\(y = \\frac{1}{4p}(x - h)^2 + k\\).\n- **Let me compare:** My equation is \\(y = 8(x - 0)^2 + 2\\), which can be rewritten as:\n\n  \\[\n  y = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{4}}(x - 0)^2 + 2 \\implies p = \\frac{1}{4}\n  \\]\n\n- **Wait, that seems off because** in my equation, the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is 8, which means \\(\\frac{1}{4p} = 8\\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{4p} = 8 \\implies p = \\frac{1}{32}\n  \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Distance \\(p\\):** \\(\\frac{1}{32}\\)\n- **Focus Location:** \\((0, 2 + \\frac{1}{32}) = \\left(0, \\frac{65}{32}\\right)\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determining the Directrix**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The directrix is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry and is located \\(p\\) units away from the vertex, but in the opposite direction from the focus.\n- **So, if the focus is at \\(\\left(0, \\frac{65}{32}\\right)\\),** the directrix will be at \\(y = k - p = 2 - \\frac{1}{32}\\).\n\n**Calculating the Directrix:**\n\n\\[\ny = 2 - \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{64}{32} - \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{63}{32}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** The directrix should be below the vertex since the focus is above it.\n- **Reflection:** Yes, \\(\\frac{63}{32} = 1.96875\\), which is indeed slightly below \\(y = 2\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Equation of the Directrix:** \\(y = \\frac{63}{32}\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach and Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Wait, let me double-check everything.**\n- I've identified the vertex, calculated the distance to the focus, and determined the location of the directrix.\n- **But is there another way to confirm?** Maybe by looking at the definition of the directrix.\n\n**Alternative Verification:**\n\n- **Definition Recap:** The directrix is a line such that any point on the parabola is equidistant from the focus and the directrix.\n- **But how does that help here?** Because I've already used the properties of parabolas to derive the necessary components.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Does the distance \\(p\\) make sense given the equation's coefficients?\n- **Calculation Check:** \\(\\frac{1}{4p} = 8 \\implies 4p = \\frac{1}{8} \\implies p = \\frac{1}{32}\\). **That seems correct.**\n\n**Random Insight:**\n\n- **Maybe there's a quicker way,** but given the straightforward nature of the problem and the accuracy of my calculations, I'm confident in the answer.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Is the directrix at \\(y = \\frac{63}{32}\\)?**\n- **Numerical Check:** \\(\\frac{63}{32} = 1.96875\\), which is logically placed below the vertex \\(y = 2\\). **That feels right.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Final Answer:** The equation of the directrix is \\(y = \\frac{63}{32}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Did brainstorming help?** Absolutely, it guided me through recognizing the standard form and confirming each step.\n- **Was completing the square necessary?** No, realizing that the equation matched the standard form without it simplified the process.\n- **Were there any moments of confusion?** Initially, I wasn't sure about the value of \\(p\\), but recalculating clarified it.\n- **Is the approach correct?** Yes, every step logically follows from the previous one, leading to a consistent and accurate answer.\n\n**Wrapping Up:**\n\n- By systematically identifying the vertex, calculating the focal distance, and determining the position of the directrix, I've arrived at the correct equation for the directrix.\n- Regular checks ensured that each part was accurate, and alternative verification solidified the final answer.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe equation of the directrix of the parabola \\(y = 8x^2 + 2\\) is \\(y = \\frac{63}{32}\\).",

To make the algebra a bit easier, we can find the directrix of the parabola $y = 8x^2,$ and then shift it upward 2 units to find the directrix of the parabola $y = 8x^2 + 2.$\n\nSince the parabola $y = 8x^2$ is symmetric about the $y$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(0,f).$  Let $y = d$ be the equation of the directrix.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1.5 cm);\n\npair F, P, Q;\n\nF = (0,1/4);\nP = (1,1);\nQ = (1,-1/4);\n\nreal parab (real x) {\n  return(x^2);\n}\n\ndraw(graph(parab,-1.5,1.5),red);\ndraw((-1.5,-1/4)--(1.5,-1/4),dashed);\ndraw(P--F);\ndraw(P--Q);\n\ndot(\"$F$\", F, NW);\ndot(\"$P$\", P, E);\ndot(\"$Q$\", Q, S);\n[/asy]\n\nLet $(x,8x^2)$ be a point on the parabola $y = 8x^2.$  Then\n\\[PF^2 = x^2 + (8x^2 - f)^2\\]and $PQ^2 = (8x^2 - d)^2.$  Thus,\n\\[x^2 + (8x^2 - f)^2 = (8x^2 - d)^2.\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[x^2 + 64x^4 - 16fx^2 + f^2 = 64x^4 - 16dx^2 + d^2.\\]Matching coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n1 - 16f &= -16d, \\\\\nf^2 &= d^2.\n\\end{align*}From the first equation, $f - d = \\frac{1}{16}.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $-2d = \\frac{1}{16},$ so $d = -\\frac{1}{32}.$\n\nThus, the equation of the directrix of $y = 8x^2$ is $y = -\\frac{1}{32},$ so the equation of the directrix of $y = 8x^2 + 2$ is $\\boxed{y = \\frac{63}{32}}.$"
