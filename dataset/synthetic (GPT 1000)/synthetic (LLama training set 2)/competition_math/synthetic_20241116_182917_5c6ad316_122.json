I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my approach, check for accuracy along the way, and adjust my methods as needed. Let's see where this takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\), I recall that it's a trigonometric identity involving sine and cosine functions. The goal is to find the value of \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\).\n\n**Possible Approaches:**\n\n1. **Use Trigonometric Identities:** Maybe I can leverage the Pythagorean identity or angle sum/difference identities.\n2. **Express One Function in Terms of the Other:** Since \\(\\sin x\\) is equal to \\(3 \\cos x\\), perhaps substituting one in terms of the other would help.\n3. **Use the Double Angle Formula:** I know there's a formula involving \\(\\sin 2x\\) that relates \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\) directly.\n\nI think starting with expressing one function in terms of the other might be a good beginning. If that doesn't work out, I'll explore the other options.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Express \\(\\sin x\\) in Terms of \\(\\cos x\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nGiven \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\), I can express \\(\\sin x\\) as a multiple of \\(\\cos x\\). This looks straightforward, so let's do that.\n\n\\[\n\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems correct because it's directly given. No need to question it further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substitute into the Pythagorean Identity**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nI know that the fundamental Pythagorean identity is:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\n\\]\n\nSince I have \\(\\sin x\\) in terms of \\(\\cos x\\), I can substitute this into the identity to find \\(\\cos x\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFirst, substitute \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\) into the identity:\n\n\\[\n(3 \\cos x)^2 + \\cos^2 x = 1\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n9 \\cos^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n10 \\cos^2 x = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(\\cos^2 x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\cos^2 x = \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a moment, that seems plausible. When I take the square root to find \\(\\cos x\\), I'll get two possible values (\\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10}}\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10}}\\)). Since we're dealing with trigonometric functions, both positive and negative could be valid depending on the angle \\(x\\).\n\nBut before proceeding, let's check if this aligns with the original equation \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verify Consistency with the Original Equation**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nIf \\(\\cos^2 x = \\frac{1}{10}\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\cos x = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{10}\n\\]\n\nNow, using \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin x = 3 \\left(\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{10}\\right) = \\pm \\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Potential Issue:**\n\nWait a second. The sine function \\(\\sin x\\) has a maximum value of 1. However, \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{10} \\approx 0.948\\), which is less than 1. So, this seems acceptable.\n\nBut to be sure, let's check if there's a specific angle \\(x\\) that satisfies both \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) being within their respective ranges.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{10} \\approx 0.948\n\\]\n\nSince \\(0.948 < 1\\), it looks fine.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) values are within the permissible range for trigonometric functions. This suggests that our approach is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, to find \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\), I can use the fact that:\n\n\\[\n\\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin 2x\n\\]\n\nBut since we're looking for a more direct approach, let's continue by multiplying \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) from what we have so far.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nWe already have:\n\n\\[\n\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(\\cos x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin x \\cos x = 3 \\cos^2 x\n\\]\n\nWe know \\(\\cos^2 x = \\frac{1}{10}\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\sin x \\cos x = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so \\(\\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{3}{10}\\). Let me quickly verify this.\n\nIf \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\), and \\(\\cos^2 x = \\frac{1}{10}\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\cos x = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{10}\n\\]\n\nAnd:\n\n\\[\n\\sin x = 3 \\times \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{10} = \\pm \\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{10}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin x \\cos x = \\left(\\pm \\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{10}\\right) \\left(\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{10}\\right) = \\frac{3 \\times 10}{100} = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nAll values are within the expected range, and the calculations are consistent. The approach seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Using the Double Angle Formula**\n\n**Idea:**\n\nAnother method to find \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\) is to use the double angle formula for sine:\n\n\\[\n\\sin 2x = 2 \\sin x \\cos x\n\\]\n\nSince we already have \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\), let's see if this can lead us to the same answer.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFrom \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\), we found:\n\n\\[\n\\sin x \\cos x = 3 \\cos^2 x = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\nNow, using the double angle formula:\n\n\\[\n\\sin 2x = 2 \\sin x \\cos x = 2 \\times \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, this gives me \\(\\sin 2x = \\frac{3}{5}\\), which is different from what we initially calculated for \\(\\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{3}{10}\\). Let's double-check.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet's verify step by step:\n\n1. From \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x\\), we found \\(\\cos^2 x = \\frac{1}{10}\\).\n2. Therefore, \\(\\cos x = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{10}\\).\n3. So, \\(\\sin x = 3 \\cos x = \\pm \\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{10}\\).\n4. Now, \\(\\sin x \\cos x = 3 \\cos^2 x = \\frac{3}{10}\\).\n\nThis aligns with the earlier calculation. But using the double angle formula, we arrived at \\(\\sin 2x = \\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThere's a discrepancy here. The value \\(\\sin x \\cos x = \\frac{3}{10}\\) seems consistent throughout the steps, while the double angle approach also checks out but gives a different context.\n\n**Possible Reason:**\n\nThe double angle formula is correct, but it provides information about \\(\\sin 2x\\) rather than directly giving \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\). Our direct calculation method is more straightforward for this problem.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth methods are valid, but the direct multiplication approach is simpler and more direct for finding \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying calculations, the value of \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Brainstormed Strategies:** Started by considering expressing one trigonometric function in terms of the other, using Pythagorean identities, and leveraging double angle formulas.\n2. **Expressed \\(\\sin x\\) in Terms of \\(\\cos x\\):** Used the given equation to substitute and simplify.\n3. **Applied the Pythagorean Identity:** Solved for \\(\\cos^2 x\\) and verified the consistency of the trigonometric function values.\n4. **Calculated \\(\\sin x \\cos x\\):** Directly multiplied \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) using the known values.\n5. **Double-Checked with Alternative Approach:** Used the double angle formula to verify the consistency of the result, though it wasn't necessary for this specific calculation.\n6. **Reflected and Verified:** Regularly checked if the calculations made sense and aligned with trigonometric properties.\n\nThroughout the process, I remained open to adjusting strategies, reflecting on each step's correctness, and ensuring that all values were within the valid range for trigonometric functions.",
