Let's make sure to think through each step, reflecting and checking if the methods I'm using are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the question:\n\n> Find \\( q(x) \\) if the graph of \\( \\frac{3x^3 - x^2 - 10x}{q(x)} \\) has:\n> - A hole at \\( x = 2 \\)\n> - A vertical asymptote at \\( x = -1 \\)\n> - No horizontal asymptote\n> - \\( q(1) = -6 \\)\n\nMy initial reaction is that this involves understanding the behavior of rational functions\u2014specifically, where holes and vertical asymptotes occur, and what that implies about \\( q(x) \\).\n\nI'm reminded of properties of rational functions I've encountered before. It seems that factoring the numerator and analyzing the denominator could be key here.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm not exactly sure how to start. Maybe I should consider factorizing the numerator first to see how it relates to the denominator.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Factor the Numerator:**\n   - Perhaps factoring \\( 3x^3 - x^2 - 10x \\) will reveal more about the roots and their relationship with \\( q(x) \\).\n\n2. **Understand Holes and Asymptotes:**\n   - I recall that a hole occurs when both the numerator and denominator have a common factor.\n   - A vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator has a factor that the numerator doesn't cancel out.\n   - No horizontal asymptote typically means the degree of the numerator is higher than that of the denominator.\n\n3. **Use Given Point \\( q(1) = -6 \\):**\n   - This specific value might help in determining the coefficients in \\( q(x) \\) after figuring out its structure.\n\nHmm, factoring the numerator seems like a good starting point. Let me try that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Factor the Numerator**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to factor \\( 3x^3 - x^2 - 10x \\) to see if there are any roots that correspond to the hole at \\( x = 2 \\). If \\( x = 2 \\) is a root, then \\( (x - 2) \\) should be a factor.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's divide \\( 3x^3 - x^2 - 10x \\) by \\( (x - 2) \\) using synthetic or polynomial long division.\n\n**Using Synthetic Division:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n2 & 3 & -1 & -10 & 0 \\\\\n  &   & 6  & 10  & 0 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & 3 & 5  & 0   & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Result:**\n\n\\[\n3x^2 + 5x\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( 3x^3 - x^2 - 10x = (x - 2)(3x^2 + 5x) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute\u2014this gives me \\( 3x^2 + 5x \\). I was expecting to factor it further, but maybe this is as far as it goes. Let me check if \\( 3x^2 + 5x \\) can be factored further.\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\( 3x^2 + 5x \\) doesn't have real roots (discriminant \\( 5^2 - 4 \\times 3 \\times 0 = 25 - 0 = 25 \\)), but maybe it's not necessary to factor it further for my purpose right now. I'll keep it as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Set Up the Denominator \\( q(x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince there's a hole at \\( x = 2 \\), \\( q(x) \\) must also have \\( (x - 2) \\) as a factor so that it cancels out with the numerator. This would make the hole at \\( x = 2 \\) instead of a vertical asymptote.\n\nAdditionally, there's a vertical asymptote at \\( x = -1 \\), which means \\( q(x) \\) must have \\( (x + 1) \\) as a factor. The horizontal asymptote condition suggests the degree of \\( q(x) \\) is less than the degree of the numerator after cancellation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nGiven these conditions, \\( q(x) \\) should have factors \\( (x - 2) \\) and \\( (x + 1) \\). Let\u2019s write \\( q(x) \\) as:\n\n\\[\nq(x) = k(x - 2)(x + 1)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant to be determined.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense because having \\( (x - 2) \\) in both the numerator and denominator cancels out the hole, and \\( (x + 1) \\) in the denominator creates the vertical asymptote. The absence of a horizontal asymptote is consistent with the degrees.\n\nBut I need to make sure this aligns with the given \\( q(1) = -6 \\). Let's proceed to find \\( k \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Constant \\( k \\) Using \\( q(1) = -6 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWe know \\( q(1) = -6 \\). Let's substitute \\( x = 1 \\) into the expression for \\( q(x) \\) and solve for \\( k \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nq(1) = k(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = k(-1)(2) = -2k\n\\]\n\nSetting this equal to -6:\n\n\\[\n-2k = -6\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{-6}{-2} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\n\\[\nq(1) = k \\times (-1) \\times 2 = -2k \\rightarrow -2 \\times 3 = -6\n\\]\n\nThat checks out. So, \\( k = 3 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Write the Function \\( q(x) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I've determined \\( k = 3 \\), I can write \\( q(x) \\) fully:\n\n\\[\nq(x) = 3(x - 2)(x + 1)\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me quickly verify if this makes sense:\n\n- **Hole at \\( x = 2 \\):** \\( q(x) \\) has \\( (x - 2) \\), which cancels with the numerator, creating a hole.\n- **Vertical Asymptote at \\( x = -1 \\):** \\( q(x) \\) has \\( (x + 1) \\), leading to a vertical asymptote since it doesn't cancel with the numerator.\n- **No Horizontal Asymptote:** The degree of \\( q(x) \\) (which is 2) is less than the degree of the numerator after cancellation (which is 3).\n- **\\( q(1) = -6 \\):** Verified earlier.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\nq(x) = 3(x - 2)(x + 1)\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBy factorizing the numerator, I identified that \\( (x - 2) \\) is a common factor, leading to a hole at \\( x = 2 \\). Setting up \\( q(x) \\) with \\( (x - 2) \\) and \\( (x + 1) \\) ensured the vertical asymptote at \\( x = -1 \\) and no horizontal asymptote. Finally, using the given \\( q(1) = -6 \\), I determined the constant \\( k = 3 \\).\n\nThroughout the process, I checked each step to ensure consistency with the problem's conditions, reflecting and adjusting my approach as needed. This methodical approach led to a correct and verified solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Factorising the numerator gives us\n$$\\frac{3x^3-x^2-10x}{q(x)} = \\frac{x(x-2)(3x+5)}{q(x)}.$$There will only be a hole at $x=2$ if both the numerator and denominator are $0$ when $x=2$. We can see that this is already true for the numerator, hence $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x-2$.\n\nSince there is a vertical asymptote at $x=-1$, $q(-1) = 0$. By the Factor theorem, $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x+1$.\n\nSince there is no horizontal asymptote, we know that the degree of $q(x)$ must be less than the degree of the numerator. The numerator has a degree of $3$, which means that $q(x)$ has degree at most $2$.\n\nPutting all of this together, we have that $q(x) = a(x-2)(x+1)$ for some constant $a$. Since $q(1) = -6$, we have $a(1-2)(1+1) = -6$. which we can solve to get $a = 3$.  Hence, $q(x) = \\boxed{3(x-2)(x+1)} = 3x^2-3x-6$."
