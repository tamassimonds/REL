    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and brainstorm different strategies to find the largest five-digit integer whose digits multiply to the product \\( (7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) \\). I'll walk through my thought process step by step, exploring various approaches, reflecting on their validity, and adjusting strategies as needed, just like how I would tackle a problem naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I think:\n\n- **What am I looking for?** I need to find the largest five-digit integer whose digits multiply to \\( 7! \\) (since \\( 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\) is \\( 7! = 5040 \\)).\n- **Largest five-digit integer?** This suggests that I should use as many high digits as possible while ensuring their product equals 5040.\n- **Digits to use?** I can only use each digit from 0 to 9 once (since duplicates aren't allowed in a five-digit number).\n- **Possible strategies:** Maybe factor 5040 and see if those factors can form a five-digit number, or perhaps trial and error with high digits to check their products.\n\nAt this point, I'm not entirely sure how to proceed, so let\u2019s brainstorm and see which approach might work best.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Factorization Approach:**\n   - Factor \\( 5040 \\) into its prime components.\n   - See if these factors can be arranged into five distinct digits.\n\n2. **Trial with High Digits:**\n   - Start with the largest digits (9, 8, 7, etc.) and check their products.\n   - Adjust by replacing digits to match the required product.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Check:**\n   - Generate all combinations of five different digits and see which one has a product of 5040.\n\n4. **Use of Smaller Digits:**\n   - Consider using smaller digits to balance the product and still keep the number large.\n\n**Initial Leaning:** \nI think starting with the **Factorization Approach** might be a good idea because understanding the prime factors of 5040 could help in determining which digits to use. If that doesn't work, I can move to the **Trial with High Digits** method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Factorization Approach**\n\nLet\u2019s begin by factoring \\( 5040 \\) into its prime components.\n\n\\[\n5040 = 7 \\times 720\n\\]\n\\[\n720 = 7 \\times 102.8571 \\quad (\\text{Incorrect, let's try another factorization})\n\\]\nWait, hold on. Let me triple-check this.\n\n\\[\n5040 = 7 \\times 720\n\\]\n\\[\n720 = 8 \\times 90 = 8 \\times 9 \\times 10\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n5040 = 7 \\times 8 \\times 9 \\times 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \nOkay, that seems better. But wait, \\( 8 \\times 9 \\times 10 \\) alone gives \\( 720 \\), and when multiplied by 7 gives \\( 5040 \\). However, we need five digits in total. This doesn't directly help since we need five distinct digits.\n\n**Realization:** \nHmm, this isn't leading me to a five-digit number with distinct digits. Maybe I need to rethink this approach.\n\n---\n\n**Alternative Brainstorming:**\nPerhaps factoring alone isn\u2019t sufficient. Maybe I should consider using smaller digits along with these factors to form a valid five-digit number.\n\n**Action:**\nLet\u2019s combine the factorization insight with the idea of using high digits to form the largest possible number.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Combining Factors with High Digits**\n\nSince \\( 5040 = 7 \\times 720 \\) and \\( 720 = 8 \\times 90 \\) and \\( 90 = 9 \\times 10 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n5040 = 7 \\times 8 \\times 9 \\times 10\n\\]\n\nBut this gives us only four digits. Wait, I need five digits. Perhaps I can split one of the larger numbers into smaller digits that multiply to it.\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\nMaybe I can break down 10 into 2 and 5, so:\n\n\\[\n5040 = 7 \\times 8 \\times 9 \\times 2 \\times 5\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nLet\u2019s see if multiplying these gives 5040.\n\n\\[\n7 \\times 8 = 56\n\\]\n\\[\n56 \\times 9 = 504\n\\]\n\\[\n504 \\times 2 = 1008\n\\]\n\\[\n1008 \\times 5 = 5040\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, this works. Now we have the digits 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9. But is this the largest five-digit number possible with such a combination?\n\n**Check:**\nLet\u2019s arrange these digits in descending order to form the largest number: **98752**.\n\n---\n\n**Verification:**\nBefore finalizing, let\u2019s quickly check if this number (98752) has a digit product of 5040.\n\n\\[\n9 \\times 8 = 72\n\\]\n\\[\n72 \\times 7 = 504\n\\]\n\\[\n504 \\times 5 = 2520\n\\]\n\\[\n2520 \\times 2 = 5040\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe product matches \\( 5040 \\), and the number is indeed five digits.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Alternative Approach - Trial with High Digits**\n\nJust to ensure that our initial approach is correct, let\u2019s try another method: starting with the largest possible digits and adjusting as needed.\n\n**User Query:**\nFind the largest five-digit integer whose digits multiply to \\( 5040 \\).\n\n**Case Study:**\n\n**Initial Attempt:**\nSuppose I start with the largest five-digit number, which is **99999**.\n\n**Calculation:**\nLet\u2019s check the product of its digits:\n\n\\[\n9 \\times 9 \\times 9 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 9^5 = 59049\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, \\( 59049 \\) is larger than \\( 5040 \\). This means I need to lower some digits to decrease the product.\n\n**Strategy Adjustment:**\nLet\u2019s replace one or more digits with smaller ones while maintaining the largest possible number.\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\nMaybe I can replace one of the nines with an eight, or perhaps start introducing smaller digits like seven or six.\n\n**Action:**\nLet\u2019s replace one 9 with an 8:\n\n\\[\n99899\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n9 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 9^3 \\times 8 = 729 \\times 8 = 5832\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\\( 5832 \\) is still larger than \\( 5040 \\). I need to decrease the product further.\n\n**Continuing:**\nLet\u2019s replace another 9 with a 7:\n\n\\[\n99789\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n9 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 8 \\times 9 = 9^2 \\times 7 \\times 8 = 81 \\times 7 \\times 8 = 4536\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\\( 4536 \\) is less than \\( 5040 \\), so we\u2019ve overshot the target by replacing the second 9.\n\n**Strategy Adjustment:**\nSince replacing two 9s brought the product below \\( 5040 \\), maybe I need to adjust the digits differently or stop here.\n\n**Realization:**\nWait, our earlier factorization approach led us directly to 98752, which matches the required product. This trial-and-error method is taking longer and is less efficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check with Factorization Insight**\n\nTo ensure accuracy, let\u2019s revisit the factorization approach and confirm that 98752 is indeed the largest five-digit number with digits multiplying to \\( 5040 \\).\n\n**Re-examining Factors:**\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\n\\[\n5040 = 7 \\times 8 \\times 9 \\times 2 \\times 5\n\\]\n\n**Arranging for Largest Number:**\n\nTo form the largest five-digit number, arrange the digits in descending order:\n\n**Digits:** 9, 8, 7, 5, 2\n\n**Largest Number:** **98752**\n\n**Verification:**\n\n\\[\n9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\times 2 = 5040\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n9 \\times 8 = 72\n\\]\n\\[\n72 \\times 7 = 504\n\\]\n\\[\n504 \\times 5 = 2520\n\\]\n\\[\n2520 \\times 2 = 5040\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe product matches \\( 5040 \\), and the number is five digits. This confirms that **98752** is indeed the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThrough brainstorming and exploring different strategies, the **Factorization Approach** proved to be the most efficient. Initially, attempting to factor \\( 5040 \\) led to realizing that breaking down larger components into smaller digits was key. Complementing this with arranging digits in descending order ensured that the largest possible five-digit number was found.\n\nThe **Trial with High Digits** method, while useful for verification, was less direct and required more adjustments. This step-by-step exploration, complete with reflection and strategy adjustments, ensured a thorough and accurate solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe largest five-digit integer whose digits have a product equal to \\( (7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) \\) is **98752**.",

  "ground_truth": "Since we want a large 5-digit integer, we want the digits to the left to be as large as possible. We prime factorize the product to get $7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 2^4$. The largest single-digit number is $9$, which can be found by $3^2$. This leaves us $7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2^4$. We can get the next largest number, $8$, by using $2^3$. This leaves $7 \\cdot 5\\cdot 2$. We can't multiply any of those numbers together to get a single-digit number, so we have that the remaining three digits are $7,5$, and $2$. Ordering the digits from largest to smallest, we get $\\boxed{98752}$."
