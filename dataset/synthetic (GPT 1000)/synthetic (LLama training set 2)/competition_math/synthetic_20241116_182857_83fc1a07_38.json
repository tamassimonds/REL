    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through each part as a human would. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether each approach is correct, and adjust my path as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem asks how many positive integers \\( n \\) satisfy the inequality:\n\n\\[\n(n + 8)(n - 3)(n - 12) < 0\n\\]\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Factoring and Zero Points:** This expression is a product of three linear factors. I remember from previous problems that such inequalities often involve finding where the product changes sign, which typically happens at the zeros of each factor.\n\n- **Number Line Testing:** Maybe splitting the number line at these zeros and testing intervals to see where the product is negative would work.\n\n- **Polynomial Characteristics:** Since it's a cubic polynomial, I know that the end behavior is important. But focusing on zeroes and testing intervals might be more straightforward.\n\n- **Graphical Approach:** Another idea could be to sketch the graph to visually identify where the product is negative, but this might be less precise without actual graphing tools.\n\n**Reflection:** The factoring and number line testing seem like a solid starting point, as it's a method I've used successfully before with polynomial inequalities.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Zeros of the Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find where the expression changes sign, I need to determine the values of \\( n \\) that make each factor zero.\n\n\\[\n(n + 8) = 0 \\implies n = -8\n\\]\n\\[\n(n - 3) = 0 \\implies n = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n(n - 12) = 0 \\implies n = 12\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, does it make sense to include \\( n = -8 \\) since we're only looking for positive integers? Hmm, perhaps I should only consider \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( n = 12 \\) for the final count. But for testing the sign, I'll include all zeros initially and then focus on positive integers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Create a Number Line and Test Intervals**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, let's set up a number line divided at the zeros: \\( n = -8 \\), \\( n = 3 \\), and \\( n = 12 \\). I'll test the sign of the expression in each interval to see where it's negative.\n\n**Intervals to Test:**\n\n1. \\( n < -8 \\)\n2. \\( -8 < n < 3 \\)\n3. \\( 3 < n < 12 \\)\n4. \\( n > 12 \\)\n\n**Testing Each Interval:**\n\n- **Interval 1: \\( n < -8 \\)**  \n  Choose \\( n = -9 \\):  \n  \\[\n  (-9 + 8)(-9 - 3)(-9 - 12) = (-1)(-12)(-21) = -252 \\quad (< 0)\n  \\]  \n  **Outcome:** Negative\n\n- **Interval 2: \\( -8 < n < 3 \\)**  \n  Choose \\( n = 0 \\):  \n  \\[\n  (0 + 8)(0 - 3)(0 - 12) = (8)(-3)(-12) = 288 \\quad (> 0)\n  \\]  \n  **Outcome:** Positive\n\n- **Interval 3: \\( 3 < n < 12 \\)**  \n  Choose \\( n = 6 \\):  \n  \\[\n  (6 + 8)(6 - 3)(6 - 12) = (14)(3)(-6) = -252 \\quad (< 0)\n  \\]  \n  **Outcome:** Negative\n\n- **Interval 4: \\( n > 12 \\)**  \n  Choose \\( n = 13 \\):  \n  \\[\n  (13 + 8)(13 - 3)(13 - 12) = (21)(10)(1) = 210 \\quad (> 0)\n  \\]  \n  **Outcome:** Positive\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis testing confirms that the expression is negative in the intervals \\( n < -8 \\) and \\( 3 < n < 12 \\). Since we're only interested in positive integers, I'll focus on the interval \\( 3 < n < 12 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Count the Positive Integer Solutions in \\( 3 < n < 12 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, let's find all positive integers \\( n \\) within the interval \\( 3 < n < 12 \\).\n\n**Possible Values of \\( n \\):**\n\n\\[\nn = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\n\\]\n\n**Number of Solutions:**\n\nThere are 8 integers listed.\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait a second, let me quickly verify:  \n- Does each of these numbers satisfy the original inequality?  \n- Since we've already established that the expression is negative in this interval, and we're only considering positive integers here, these should all work.\n\n**Quick Validation:**\n\nLet me randomly pick a couple to double-check:\n\n- **For \\( n = 5 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  (5 + 8)(5 - 3)(5 - 12) = (13)(2)(-7) = -182 \\quad (< 0)\n  \\]\n\n- **For \\( n = 10 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  (10 + 8)(10 - 3)(10 - 12) = (18)(7)(-2) = -252 \\quad (< 0)\n  \\]\n\nBoth checks align with the expectation that the expression is negative in this range.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nAfter testing different strategies and confirming through number line testing and sample checks, I\u2019m confident that the initial approach was correct.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThere are **8** positive integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the inequality \\((n + 8)(n - 3)(n - 12) < 0\\).\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Are all integers in the range accounted for?** Yes, from \\( n = 4 \\) to \\( n = 11 \\).\n- **Does the sign testing support the solution?** Absolutely, the expression is negative in the selected interval.\n- **Was there any need to adjust the strategy?** Initially considered including \\( n = -8 \\), but realized only positive integers were needed, which narrowed down the focus to \\( n = 3 \\) to \\( n = 12 \\).\n\nEverything aligns, and the solution makes sense. Let me know if there's anything else to explore!",

  "ground_truth": "If $n$ is less than $3$, then $n+8$ is positive, $n-3$ is negative, and $n-12$ is negative.  Therefore, the product on the left-hand side of the inequality is positive, so the inequality is not satisfied.  If $n$ is strictly between 3 and 12, then $n+8$ is positive, $n-3$ is positive, and $n-12$ is negative.  In this case, the product on the left-hand side is negative, so the inequality is satisfied.  If $n$ is greater than 12, then $n+8$ is positive, $n-3$ is positive, and $n-12$ is positive.  Again, the product is positive so the inequality is not satisfied.  If $n=3$ or $n=12$, then the left-hand side is 0, so the inequality is not satisfied.  Therefore, the only solutions of the inequality are the $12-3-1=\\boxed{8}$ integers strictly between 3 and 12."
