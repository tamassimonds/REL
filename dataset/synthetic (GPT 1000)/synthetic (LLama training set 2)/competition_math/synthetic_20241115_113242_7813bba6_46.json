    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle this problem the way a human would\u2014by brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and possibly changing strategies along the way. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\nOkay, I see that we have a parabola and a line that intersect at only one point. The equations are:\n\n- Parabola: \\( y_1 = x^2 + 2x + 7 \\)\n- Line: \\( y_2 = 6x + b \\)\n\nThe question asks for the value of \\( b \\) that makes these two graphs intersect at exactly one point.\n\n**First Reaction:**\n\nThis reminds me of problems where a line is tangent to a parabola. When they intersect at only one point, the line is tangent to the parabola, which means they touch at that single point without crossing.\n\nBut let's explore different strategies to be sure. Maybe I can set the equations equal to each other and see what happens, or perhaps there's another method to determine the condition for tangency.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Set the Equations Equal:**  \n   - This seems like a straightforward approach. If the line and parabola intersect at one point, their \\( y \\)-values must be equal at that point. So, \\( x^2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + b \\).\n   \n2. **Check the Discriminant of the Resulting Quadratic Equation:**  \n   - For a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), if the discriminant (\\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\)) is zero, there is exactly one real solution. This would mean the line is tangent to the parabola.\n\n3. **Graphical Insight:**  \n   - Although not an algebraic method, thinking about the shapes can provide intuition. The parabola opens upwards (since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive), and the line has a slope of 6, which is steep. Perhaps visualizing this can help.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe first two strategies seem the most direct. I'll start by setting the equations equal and then analyze the resulting quadratic to find the condition on \\( b \\). If this doesn't work or seems too complicated, I'll reconsider using the discriminant method explicitly or perhaps look for another approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting the Equations Equal**\n\nLet\u2019s set \\( y_1 \\) equal to \\( y_2 \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + b\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThis should give me a quadratic equation in terms of \\( x \\). If the line is tangent to the parabola, the quadratic should have exactly one solution, meaning the discriminant must be zero.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 2x + 7 - 6x - b = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify it:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + (7 - b) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, the quadratic equation is:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + (7 - b) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, now I need to think about what's next. I need to ensure that this quadratic equation has only one solution, which will happen if the discriminant is zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Discriminant**\n\nThe general form of a quadratic equation is \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), and the discriminant \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\).\n\n**Identifying Components:**\n\nFrom \\( x^2 - 4x + (7 - b) = 0 \\):\n\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -4 \\)\n- \\( c = 7 - b \\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (7 - b)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = 16 - 4(7 - b)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = 16 - 28 + 4b\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = -12 + 4b\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFor the quadratic to have exactly one solution (meaning the line is tangent to the parabola), the discriminant must be zero:\n\n\\[\n-12 + 4b = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nSolving for \\( b \\) should give me the value where the line is tangent to the parabola. Let me proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\( b \\)**\n\nSet the discriminant equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n-12 + 4b = 0\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n4b = 12\n\\]\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{12}{4} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me quickly verify:\n\n- When \\( b = 3 \\), the discriminant \\( \\Delta = -12 + 4(3) = 0 \\). This confirms that there is exactly one solution for the quadratic equation.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThis seems to make sense. When \\( b = 3 \\), the line \\( y_2 = 6x + 3 \\) is tangent to the parabola \\( y_1 = x^2 + 2x + 7 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nBefore concluding, let's ensure that everything aligns:\n\n- **Quadratic Equation:** \\( x^2 - 4x + (7 - 3) = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \\)\n- **Discriminant Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  \\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(4) = 16 - 16 = 0\n  \\]\n- **Implication:**  \n  Since \\( \\Delta = 0 \\), there is exactly one solution, meaning the line touches the parabola at a single point.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach feels correct. The math checks out, and the condition for tangency is satisfied.\n\n**Alternative Strategy Consideration:**\n\nI initially thought about also using graphical insight or analyzing the properties of tangents to parabolas, but setting the equations equal and solving for the discriminant provided a clear and direct path to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Using the Nature of Tangents**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nJust to ensure completeness, let's think about another method. The property of tangents to parabolas states that the perpendicular distance from the vertex to the line equals the radius of the osculating circle. However, this involves more complex geometry and is not as straightforward as the algebraic approach we've taken.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nSince our initial method worked well, there's no need to complicate things further. However, it's always good to be aware of multiple strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThrough setting the equations equal and ensuring the quadratic's discriminant is zero, we find that:\n\n\\[\nb = 3\n\\]\n\nThis value of \\( b \\) ensures that the line \\( y_2 = 6x + b \\) intersects the parabola \\( y_1 = x^2 + 2x + 7 \\) at exactly one point, making the line tangent to the parabola.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstormed Strategies:** Set the equations equal and analyze the discriminant; consider graphical insights.\n- **Implemented Strategy:** Set \\( y_1 = y_2 \\) to form a quadratic equation; calculated the discriminant and solved for \\( b \\).\n- **Reflected and Checked:** Confirmed that the discriminant being zero corresponds to tangency; verified calculations.\n- **Alternative Consideration:** Acknowledged other methods like geometric properties but concluded that the algebraic approach sufficed.\n- **Final Conclusion:** \\( b = 3 \\) is the required value for the line to be tangent to the parabola.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, complete with brainstorming, reflection, and checking, ensures a thorough and correct solution.\n\n---\n\n**Real-World User Query:**\n\n*User:* \"I have a parabola and a line that intersect at only one point.

Here's how I would approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, I think about the properties of parabolas and lines. Intersecting at only one point suggests that the line is **tangent** to the parabola.

For tangency, the discriminant of this equation must be zero.
