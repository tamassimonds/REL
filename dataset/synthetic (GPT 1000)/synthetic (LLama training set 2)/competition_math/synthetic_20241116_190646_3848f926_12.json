    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, just like how I would naturally tackle it if I were working through it myself. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I notice it involves probability, specifically finding the chance of drawing a white ball from a box containing both white and black balls. \n\n- **Initial Brainstorming**: \n  - I remember that probability is about favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes.\n  - The box has 5 white balls and 6 black balls. So, there are 11 balls in total.\n  - But wait, let me make sure I understand the question fully. Is it asking for the probability of drawing a white ball on the first try? Does it mention anything about drawing multiple balls or replacing them? No, it seems to only focus on a single draw.\n\n- **Reflection**: \n  - That makes it simpler because I only need to consider the ratio of white balls to the total number of balls.\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Simple Ratio Approach**: \n   - My first thought is to calculate the probability by taking the number of white balls divided by the total number of balls.\n\n2. **Tree Diagram Method**: \n   - Another idea is to use a tree diagram to visualize the probabilities, but since it's a single draw, maybe that's overkill.\n\n3. **Complementary Probability**: \n   - I could also think about the probability of not drawing a white ball and subtract that from 1. But this seems unnecessary since the direct method is straightforward.\n\n**Checking the Appropriateness of Strategies**\n\n- **Simple Ratio Approach**: This seems the most straightforward and appropriate for a single draw scenario.\n- **Tree Diagram**: Probably too complex for this simple problem.\n- **Complementary Probability**: Valid, but adding extra steps when the direct method works.\n\nBased on this reflection, I'll proceed with the **Simple Ratio Approach**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Calculating the Total Number of Balls**\n\n- **Thought Process**: \n  - To find the probability, I need to know the total number of possible outcomes, which is the total number of balls in the box.\n  \n- **Calculation**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Total number of balls} = 5 \\, (\\text{white}) + 6 \\, (\\text{black}) = 11\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check**: \n  - Does that add up correctly? \\(5 + 6 = 11\\). Yes, that seems right.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculating the Number of Favorable Outcomes**\n\n- **Thought Process**: \n  - Next, I need to determine the number of favorable outcomes\u2014how many white balls are there?\n  \n- **Calculation**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of favorable outcomes} = 5 \\, (\\text{white balls})\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check**: \n  - Wait, is there anything else to consider? No, the problem specifies only white and black balls, and we're asked about drawing a white ball.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Applying the Probability Formula**\n\n- **Thought Process**: \n  - Probability is defined as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n  \n- **Calculation**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of balls}} = \\frac{5}{11}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check**: \n  - Does this fraction simplify? Let me see\u20145 and 11 are both prime, so \\(\\frac{5}{11}\\) is already in its simplest form. That looks correct.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n- **Reflection**: \n  - Wait a moment\u2014does it make sense that the probability is \\(\\frac{5}{11}\\)? Since there are 5 white balls out of 11 total, that ratio seems reasonable.\n  \n- **Quick Check**: \n  - If all balls were white, the probability would be 1. If there were no white balls, it would be 0. So \\(\\frac{5}{11}\\) fits within that range.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Complementary Probability**\n\n- **Thought Process**: \n  - Just to be thorough, let's consider the complementary probability\u2014the probability of **not** drawing a white ball\u2014and see if it aligns with our original answer.\n\n- **Calculation**: \n  - Probability of not drawing a white ball:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of black balls}}{\\text{Total number of balls}} = \\frac{6}{11}\n    \\]\n  - Probability of drawing a white ball:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Probability} = 1 - \\frac{6}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} - \\frac{6}{11} = \\frac{5}{11}\n    \\]\n  \n- **Check**: \n  - This confirms our original calculation. Both methods yield the same probability.\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection**\n\n- **Does it Make Sense?**: \n  - Yes, the probability of drawing a white ball is \\(\\frac{5}{11}\\), which aligns with the expected ratio based on the number of balls.\n\n- **Was the Approach Correct?**: \n  - The Simple Ratio Approach was effective and straightforward. The Complementary Probability method also validated the result.\n\n- **Is There Anything I Would Change?**: \n  - Initially, I considered using a tree diagram, but it turned out unnecessary for this single-draw problem. Sticking with the Simple Ratio Approach kept it efficient.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe probability of drawing a white ball from the box is \\(\\frac{5}{11}\\).\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step breakdown reflects a natural human thought process, complete with brainstorming, exploring different strategies, checking work regularly, and adjusting approaches as needed. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore!",
