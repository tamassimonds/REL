    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm different strategies, explore my thoughts, check my work often, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving this on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the problem involves two functions, \\( g(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\), with specific relationships between them:\n\n1. \\( g(x) = 3f^{-1}(x) \\)\n2. \\( f(x) = \\frac{24}{x + 3} \\)\n\nWe're asked to find the value of \\( x \\) where \\( g(x) = 15 \\).\n\n**Initial Reflection:**\n\n- **Inverse Functions:** The notation \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) reminds me that \\( f^{-1} \\) is the inverse function of \\( f \\). This could be important because I'll need to find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n  \n- **Composition of Functions:** Since \\( g(x) \\) involves \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), maybe I need to express \\( g(x) \\) in terms of \\( f(x) \\) or its inverse.\n\n- **Solving for \\( x \\):** Ultimately, I need to solve for \\( x \\) where \\( g(x) = 15 \\). This seems like an equation involving \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), which suggests that I might need to manipulate these functions to find \\( x \\).\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\):** Since \\( g(x) \\) involves \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), perhaps finding the inverse of \\( f(x) \\) is a good starting point.\n\n2. **Substitute \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) into \\( g(x) \\):** Once I have \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), I can substitute it into the equation \\( g(x) = 15 \\) to find \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Check if \\( g(x) = 15 \\) Directly Implies Something About \\( f(x) \\):** Maybe there's a direct relationship that simplifies the problem without needing to find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the first strategy: finding \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding \\( f^{-1}(x) \\)**\n\n**Approach:**\n\nTo find the inverse function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), I'll set \\( f(y) = x \\) and solve for \\( y \\). This is a standard method for finding inverses.\n\n**Given:**\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{24}{x + 3} \\]\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\\[ f(y) = x \\]\n\\[ \\frac{24}{y + 3} = x \\]\n\n**Solving for \\( y \\):**\n\n1. **Multiply Both Sides by \\( y + 3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   24 = x(y + 3)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand the Right Side:**\n   \\[\n   24 = xy + 3x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Isolate \\( y \\):**\n   \\[\n   xy = 24 - 3x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{24 - 3x}{x}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait, does this seem right? Let's check if this makes sense. When finding inverses, I should be able to verify by composing \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\).\n\n- Let\u2019s temporarily set \\( y = f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{24 - 3x}{x} \\) and substitute back into \\( f(y) \\) to see if it holds.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n\\[ f\\left(\\frac{24 - 3x}{x}\\right) = \\frac{24}{\\frac{24 - 3x}{x} + 3} \\]\n\nSimplifying the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{24 - 3x}{x} + 3 = \\frac{24 - 3x + 3x}{x} = \\frac{24}{x}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nf\\left(\\frac{24 - 3x}{x}\\right) = \\frac{24}{\\frac{24}{x}} = x\n\\]\n\nThis checks out, so \\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{24 - 3x}{x} \\) seems correct.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 1:**\n\nI've successfully found \\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{24 - 3x}{x} \\).\n\n**Next Step: Substitute \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) into \\( g(x) \\).**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing \\( g(x) \\) in Terms of \\( x \\)**\n\n**Given:**\n\n\\[ g(x) = 3f^{-1}(x) \\]\n\n**Substituting \\( f^{-1}(x) \\):**\n\n\\[ g(x) = 3 \\times \\frac{24 - 3x}{x} \\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\ng(x) = \\frac{3(24 - 3x)}{x} = \\frac{72 - 9x}{x} = \\frac{72}{x} - 9\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Is this simplification correct? Let\u2019s double-check by ensuring that each step follows logically.\n\n- Multiplying \\( 3 \\) by \\( \\frac{24 - 3x}{x} \\) seems straightforward. Distributing works here, and dividing each term by \\( x \\) looks right.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 2:**\n\n\\[ g(x) = \\frac{72}{x} - 9 \\]\n\nThis expression looks clean. No apparent errors here.\n\n**Next Step: Set \\( g(x) = 15 \\) and Solve for \\( x \\).**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Equation \\( g(x) = 15 \\)**\n\n**Given:**\n\n\\[ g(x) = 15 \\]\n\n**Substituting the Expression for \\( g(x) \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{72}{x} - 9 = 15\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( x \\):**\n\n1. **Add 9 to Both Sides:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{72}{x} = 24\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply Both Sides by \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   72 = 24x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 24:**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{72}{24} = 3\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait a minute, does \\( x = 3 \\) make sense in the context of the problem? Let\u2019s do a quick check by substituting \\( x = 3 \\) back into \\( g(x) \\) to see if it indeed equals 15.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n\\[\ng(3) = \\frac{72}{3} - 9 = 24 - 9 = 15\n\\]\n\nThis checks out perfectly. So, \\( x = 3 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 3:**\n\nThe value of \\( x \\) for which \\( g(x) = 15 \\) is **\\( x = 3 \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Reflection:**\n\n- **Strategy Validation:** Initially, I thought about finding \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), which led me to correctly express \\( g(x) \\) in terms of \\( x \\). This approach worked well.\n\n- **Checking Work:** Throughout the process, I double-checked each step\u2014especially confirming that \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) was correct and that \\( g(3) = 15 \\). This ensured accuracy.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies:** While I could have explored other methods, such as checking if \\( g(x) = 15 \\) directly implies something about \\( f(x) \\), the step-by-step approach was straightforward and led to the correct answer efficiently.\n\n- **Human-Like Thinking:** I brainstormed different strategies, reflected if each step was correct, and made adjustments as needed. Checking and rechecking were integral to ensuring the solution's correctness.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe value of \\( x \\) for which \\( g(x) = 15 \\) is **\\( x = 3 \\)**.\n\n---\n\nBy handling the problem this way\u2014brainstorming, exploring different strategies, checking work along the way, and reflecting\u2014I ensured a thorough and accurate solution, mimicking a human problem-solving approach.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $g(x)=3f^{-1}(x)$, we have that $3f^{-1}(x)=15$. This means that $f^{-1}(x)=\\frac{15}{3}=5$. Since $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are inverse functions, if $f^{-1}(x)=5$, we also have that $f(5)=x$. Substituting this back into our equation $f(x)=\\frac{24}{x+3}$, we get that $$x=f(5)=\\frac{24}{5+3}=\\boxed{3}.$$"
