    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just as I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect and check my work often, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. I'll write out my thoughts, including any doubts or \"aha\" moments along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, **$(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5$**, it reminds me of order of operations, often abbreviated as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). I recall that handling what's inside the parentheses is crucial before proceeding with division and multiplication.\n\nBut to be honest, looking at the expression inside the parentheses, **$(6 + 1 - 4)$**, I feel like there's a bit of ambiguity here. Should I add and subtract from left to right? Or is there a trick I'm missing? This uncertainty makes me pause and reconsider how to proceed.\n\nAnother idea that pops into my mind is simplifying the expression step by step, ensuring each part is correct before moving on\u2014kind of like checking each step in a recipe to make sure the final dish turns out right.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Simplify Inside the Parentheses First:** \n   - Follow the order of operations strictly. This seems straightforward.\n   \n2. **Alternative Order of Operations:** \n   - Maybe there's a different way to interpret the expression. But I think sticking to standard conventions is safer.\n   \n3. **Check for Simplification Opportunities:**\n   - Look for any simplifications or patterns that might make the calculation easier.\n   \n4. **Re-evaluate if Stuck:** \n   - If I get stuck, reconsider my approach and see if there's a mistake in the previous steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplify Inside the Parentheses**\n\nLet's start with the expression inside the parentheses: **$6 + 1 - 4$**.\n\n- **Thought Process:** According to PEMDAS, I should handle addition and subtraction from left to right since there's no exponent or other operations involved.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - First, add: \\(6 + 1 = 7\\)\n  - Then, subtract: \\(7 - 4 = 3\\)\n\n- **Reflection:** Okay, that seems right. Adding 6 and 1 gives 7, then subtracting 4 leads to 3. It checks out.\n\n### **Step 2: Replace the Simplified Value Back into the Expression**\n\nNow the original expression becomes: **$21 \\div 3 \\cdot 5$**.\n\n- **Thought Process:** I need to follow PEMDAS again. Since there's no parentheses left, the next step is to handle division and multiplication from left to right.\n\n- **Reflection:** This feels straightforward. I just need to remember that division and multiplication are on the same level, so I process them as they appear from left to right.\n\n### **Step 3: Perform the Division**\n\nLet's tackle the division first: **$21 \\div 3$**.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - \\(21 \u00f7 3 = 7\\)\n\n- **Reflection:** That seems correct. Dividing 21 by 3 gives 7. No issues here.\n\n### **Step 4: Multiply the Result by 5**\n\nNow, multiply the result by 5: **$7 \\cdot 5$**.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - \\(7 \u00d7 5 = 35\\)\n\n- **Reflection:** Multiplying 7 by 5 gives 35. This step is simple, and the numbers check out.\n\n### **Step 5: Cross-Check the Results**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me quickly re-check each step to ensure everything aligns correctly.\n\n- **Checking Step 1:**  \n  - \\(6 + 1 - 4 = 3\\)  \n  - **Does it make sense?** Yes, adding 6 and 1 to get 7, then subtracting 4 yields 3. Correct.\n  \n- **Checking Step 3:**  \n  - \\(21 \u00f7 3 = 7\\)  \n  - **Does it make sense?** Yes, 21 divided by 3 is 7. Correct.\n  \n- **Checking Step 4:**  \n  - \\(7 \u00d7 5 = 35\\)  \n  - **Does it make sense?** Yes, 7 times 5 is 35. Correct.\n\n- **Overall Reflection:** All steps logically follow one another, and the calculations check out. The final answer feels right.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach**\n\n**Re-evaluating the Order of Operations:**\n\n- Initially, I considered whether there might be another way to interpret the parentheses or the overall expression. Perhaps handling addition and subtraction differently could lead to a different path.\n  \n- **Exploring Different Strategies:**\n  - What if I combined the addition and subtraction differently? But no, PEMDAS suggests handling them left to right, which aligns with my first approach.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** Sticking to the standard order of operations was the correct path. Attempting to alter it led to unnecessary complexity.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does the final answer seem reasonable? Multiplying 7 by 5 makes sense numerically, and all intermediate steps align logically.\n  \n- **Deep Reflection:** Given that all calculations are correct and the process is transparent, the final answer is reliable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer** \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{35}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Was the Initial Approach Correct?** Yes, starting with simplifying the parentheses and following PEMDAS led to the correct solution.\n  \n- **Did Alternative Strategies Help?** They reinforced that the standard order of operations was the most straightforward and effective method.\n\n- **Key Takeaway:** Always adhere to PEMDAS, simplifying inside the parentheses first, then handling division and multiplication from left to right. Regularly checking each step ensures accuracy and builds confidence in the final answer.\n\n- **Reflection:** Throughout the process, being open to re-evaluating my approach and verifying each step was crucial. This mindset helped catch potential errors early and confirmed the correctness of the final result.\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:** By meticulously walking through each step, checking my work, and being open to adjusting my strategies, I ensured a thorough and accurate solution to the problem. This approach not only led to the correct answer but also deepened my understanding of the order of operations in mathematical expressions.",
