Let's explore these strategies starting with the unit circle.\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Unit Circle Approach\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Determining the Angle:** \n  - \\(-\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}\\) radians means rotating clockwise from the positive x-axis.\n  - To better understand, let's convert this to degrees: \n    \\[\n    -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\times \\frac{180^\\circ}{\\pi} = -135^\\circ\n    \\]\n  \n- **Locating the Angle:**\n  - Starting from \\(0^\\circ\\) and moving clockwise, \\(-135^\\circ\\) lands in the third quadrant.\n  - This is because subtracting \\(135^\\circ\\) from \\(0^\\circ\\) wraps around past \\(360^\\circ - 135^\\circ = 225^\\circ\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, does this make sense? Yes, \\(225^\\circ\\) is in the third quadrant, aligning with my expectation for a \\(135^\\circ\\) clockwise rotation.\n\n**Checking the Reference Angle:**\n\n- **Calculating the Reference Angle:**\n  - The reference angle is the acute angle formed with the x-axis: \n    \\[\n    225^\\circ - 180^\\circ = 45^\\circ\n    \\]\n  \n- **Using the Unit Circle:**\n  - In the third quadrant, the tangent function is positive since both sine and cosine are negative, but their ratio (tangent) is positive.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- Hold on, I need to double-check: \n  - The reference angle is indeed \\(45^\\circ\\).\n  - In the third quadrant, \\(\\tan(225^\\circ) = \\tan(45^\\circ) = 1\\).\n  - Therefore, \\(\\tan(-135^\\circ) = 1\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = 1\n\\]\n\n**Mistake Check:**\n\n- Does this align with the property \\(\\tan(-\\theta) = -\\tan(\\theta)\\)?\n  - Yes, because \\(\\tan(\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}) = -1\\), so \\(\\tan(-\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}) = -(-1) = 1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Perfect, both methods agree: the unit circle approach and the negative angle identity confirm \\(\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = 1\\).\n\n### Step 3: Exploring the Negative Angle Identity\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Reapplying the Identity:**\n  - I recalled the property: \\(\\tan(-\\theta) = -\\tan(\\theta)\\).\n  - Let's apply it to verify our previous result.\n\n- **Assigning \\(\\theta\\):**\n  - Here, \\(\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = -\\tan \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Finding \\(\\tan \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right)\\):**\n\n- From the unit circle or knowing standard angles:\n  - \\(\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}\\) radians is \\(135^\\circ\\), in the second quadrant.\n  - Here, \\(\\tan \\left( \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = -1\\).\n\n**Applying the Identity:**\n\n\\[\n\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = -(-1) = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This matches our previous result, reinforcing that \\(\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = 1\\).\n\n**Mistake Check:**\n\n- Is there any inconsistency? \n  - No, both methods converge to the same answer: \\(1\\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- This confirms the correctness of our approach. Using the negative angle identity provided a quick check, aligning seamlessly with the unit circle method.\n\n### Step 4: Considering the Angle Addition or Subtraction Formula\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Idea:** Perhaps decompose \\(-\\frac{3 \\pi}{4}\\) into known angles using addition or subtraction formulas.\n- **Possible Angles:** Think of combining angles like \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\).\n\n**Trying It Out:**\n\n- Decompose:\n  \\[\n  -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Applying the Tangent Addition Formula:**\n  \\[\n  \\tan(a + b) = \\frac{\\tan a + \\tan b}{1 - \\tan a \\tan b}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Assigning \\(a = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(b = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\):**\n  - But wait, there's a problem here: \\(\\tan(-\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\) is undefined. Hmm, this approach is leading to an undefined situation.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Realization:** Using \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) makes \\(\\tan\\) undefined, complicating matters.\n- **Conclusion:** This method isn't effective due to the undefined nature of \\(\\tan(-\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\).\n\n**Mistake Check:**\n\n- **Check:** Does this make sense?\n  - Yes, attempting to use \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) introduces complications.\n  - It suggests that breaking down the angle this way isn't the best strategy.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **No Need for Complexity:** Given that the unit circle and negative angle identity provided direct solutions, introducing angle addition seems unnecessary.\n- **Better Approaches:** Stick with the simpler, more straightforward methods that already confirmed the answer.\n\n### Final Reflection and Conclusion\n\n**Checking Consistency:**\n\n- **All Methods Agree:** Whether using the unit circle, negative angle identity, or even attempting angle subtraction, all paths lead to \\(\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = 1\\).\n- **No Contradictions:** There's consistency across different approaches, confirming the solution's validity.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Confidence in the Answer:** The answer is confidently \\(1\\), supported by multiple strategies aligning.\n- **Learning:** Sometimes, simpler methods like the unit circle are more effective than complex formulas, especially for basic trigonometric problems.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n\\[\n\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = 1\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?**\n  - Yes, the angle's location in the third quadrant and the properties of the tangent function align perfectly.\n- **Is there anything amiss?**\n  - No, all checks confirm the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Approach Worked Well:** Starting with a straightforward method and verifying with an alternative ensured accuracy.\n- **Avoiding Overcomplication:** Recognizing when a method leads to complications (like undefined values) helped streamline the process.\n- **Reflection Benefits:** Regularly checking the work led to confidence in the correctness of the answer.\n\nBy thinking through each step, exploring different strategies, and consistently reflecting and checking the work, we've determined that \\(\\tan \\left( -\\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\right) = 1\\).",
