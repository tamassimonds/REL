    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their validity, and adjust my approach as needed. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nThe problem is:\n\n\\[ \nf(x) = x^{(x+1)}(x+2)^{(x+3)} \n\\]\n\nI need to find:\n\n\\[ \nf(0) + f(-1) + f(-2) + f(-3) \n\\]\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Exponents and Negatives:** Seeing the exponents like \\(x^{(x+1)}\\) makes me think about negative exponents. Should I worry about that here?\n- **Plugging Values:** Maybe I can just plug in each value individually and see what happens.\n- **Patterns or Symmetry:** Could there be a pattern among \\(f(0)\\), \\(f(-1)\\), \\(f(-2)\\), and \\(f(-3)\\)?\n- **Factorization:** Is there a way to factor \\(f(x)\\) to simplify calculations?\n- **Properties of Exponents:** Perhaps using properties of exponents might help, especially with negative bases.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m leaning towards evaluating each function separately at first to see if any patterns emerge. But I\u2019ll keep an eye out for any simplifications along the way.\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluating \\(f(0)\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let\u2019s start with \\(x = 0\\) since it's the simplest. If this works out neatly, maybe the others will too.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nf(0) = 0^{(0+1)}(0+2)^{(0+3)} = 0^1 \\cdot 2^3 = 0 \\cdot 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Okay, \\(f(0) = 0\\). Hmm, that makes sense because any number multiplied by zero is zero. I wonder if the other values will follow a similar pattern.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does it seem right? Since \\(0^1 = 0\\), multiplying by anything else doesn\u2019t matter. So, \\(f(0) = 0\\) is correct.\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating \\(f(-1)\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Next, let\u2019s try \\(x = -1\\). Negative exponents could get tricky, but I think I can handle it.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nf(-1) = (-1)^{(-1+1)}((-1)+2)^{((-1)+3)} = (-1)^0 \\cdot 1^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nf(-1) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- So, \\(f(-1) = 1\\). Wait, that seems neat. The negative exponent became zero, which always equals one. Looks like \\(f(-1)\\) is just \\(1^2\\), so it simplifies nicely.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does \\(f(-1) = 1\\) make sense? Yes, any number to the power of zero is one, and \\(1^2 = 1\\). Seems correct.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluating \\(f(-2)\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Alright, moving on to \\(f(-2)\\). Let\u2019s see if the pattern holds.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nf(-2) = (-2)^{(-2+1)}((-2)+2)^{((-2)+3)} = (-2)^{-1} \\cdot 0^1\n\\]\n\n\\[\nf(-2) = \\frac{1}{(-2)^1} \\cdot 0 = \\frac{1}{-2} \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Hmm, \\(f(-2) = 0\\). This time, even though \\((-2)^{-1}\\) is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\), multiplying by \\(0\\) makes the whole thing zero. I guess zero has that multiplying effect again.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does it seem right? Yes, any number multiplied by zero is zero, regardless of the other factor. So, \\(f(-2) = 0\\) checks out.\n\n### **Step 4: Evaluating \\(f(-3)\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Last one, \\(f(-3)\\). Let\u2019s hope it follows a similar pattern.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nf(-3) = (-3)^{(-3+1)}((-3)+2)^{((-3)+3)} = (-3)^{-2} \\cdot (-1)^0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nf(-3) = \\frac{1}{(-3)^2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- So, \\(f(-3) = \\frac{1}{9}\\). Wait a second, this is interesting. Unlike \\(f(-1)\\) and \\(f(-2)\\), there\u2019s no zero involved here, so the negative exponent just flips it to a positive fraction.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does \\(f(-3) = \\frac{1}{9}\\) make sense? Yes, because squaring \\(-3\\) gives \\(9\\), and taking the reciprocal gives \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\). Seems logical.\n\n### **Step 5: Adding Them Up**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, let\u2019s sum up all the values: \\(f(0) + f(-1) + f(-2) + f(-3)\\). I\u2019m curious if they add up to something simple.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nf(0) + f(-1) + f(-2) + f(-3) = 0 + 1 + 0 + \\frac{1}{9} = 1 + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{9}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{10}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait, the total is \\(\\frac{10}{9}\\). That\u2019s slightly more than \\(1\\). At first glance, it seems a bit messy, but I think adding fractions is correct here.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Does \\(\\frac{10}{9}\\) make sense as an answer? Yes, it\u2019s a valid fractional result. And since none of the individual calculations led to errors, the final sum seems accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Verification**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Starting with individual evaluations was a straightforward method, especially since the function definition didn't provide immediate factoring options or symmetry insights.\n- **Reflection on Each Step:** Checking each calculation ensured that any potential mistakes were caught early, particularly with negative exponents.\n- **Mistake Catching:** By handling each \\(f(x)\\) separately, I avoided compounding errors that might occur if trying to simplify the entire expression upfront.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** If I had noticed patterns or symmetries early on, perhaps factoring could have simplified the process. However, given the mixed results (some zeros, some fractions), the step-by-step evaluation proved effective.\n- **Final Answer Confidence:** The systematic approach led to a consistent and logical result, \\(\\frac{10}{9}\\), which makes sense given the evaluations.\n\nOverall, by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each calculation, and adjusting the approach as needed, I arrived at the correct solution: \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{10}{9}}\n\\]",
