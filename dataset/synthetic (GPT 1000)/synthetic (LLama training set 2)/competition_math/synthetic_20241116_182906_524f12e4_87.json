I'll write out my thoughts just as I would if I were working through the problem naturally, including any confusion, insights, mistakes, and corrections along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, the question is asking for the **least common multiple (LCM)** of **135** and **468**. \n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Wait, LCM...?** This reminds me of finding common multiples but at the smallest common point. I think it involves the multiples of each number.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Listing Multiples:** List out the multiples of each number until I find the smallest common one.\n  2. **Prime Factorization:** Break down each number into its prime factors and use those to find the LCM.\n  3. **Using the GCD:** There's a relationship between LCM and GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) that I recall\u2014maybe I can use that.\n\n**Initial thoughts:**\n- **Listing multiples seems straightforward**, but it might take time, especially if the numbers are large.\n- **Prime factorization could be more efficient**, but I'm not always perfect at that.\n- **Using the GCD relationship is probably the quickest way**, since I remember there's a formula involving both GCD and LCM.\n\n**Hmm, let me see...**\n\nI think starting with **prime factorization** might help me understand the numbers better, and then I can decide if I want to continue with that or switch to another method like using the GCD.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Prime Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Okay, let's try breaking down 135 and 468 into their prime factors.** Maybe this will give me a clear picture of their components and help in finding the LCM.\n\n**Starting with 135:**\n- **Is 135 divisible by 2?** No, it's odd.\n- **Try 3 instead:** \n  - 135 \u00f7 3 = 45 \n  - Wait, let me double-check: \n    - 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is divisible by 3, so 135 \u00f7 3 = 45 is correct.\n- **Now, factor 45:**\n  - 45 \u00f7 3 = 15 (since 4 + 5 = 9, divisible by 3)\n  - 15 \u00f7 3 = 5 (since 1 + 5 = 6, divisible by 3)\n  - 5 \u00f7 5 = 1 \n\n**Prime factorization of 135:**  \n\\[ 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \\]  \nOr,  \n\\[ 3^3 \u00d7 5 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Alright, so 135 is made up of three 3s and one 5.** That seems clear.\n\n**Now, let's do the same for 468:**\n- **Start with 2 since 468 is even:**\n  - 468 \u00f7 2 = 234\n  - 234 \u00f7 2 = 117\n  - 117 \u00f7 3 = 39 (1 + 1 + 7 = 9, divisible by 3)\n  - 39 \u00f7 3 = 13 (since 3 \u00d7 13 = 39)\n\n**Prime factorization of 468:**   \n\\[ 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 13 \\]  \nOr,  \n\\[ 2^2 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 13 \\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Let me quickly verify:**  \n  - 2 \u00d7 2 = 4  \n  - 4 \u00d7 3 = 12  \n  - 12 \u00d7 3 = 36  \n  - 36 \u00d7 13 = 468  \n- **Yes, that checks out.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the LCM Using Prime Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Now that I have the prime factorizations, how do I use them to find the LCM?** \n- **I remember that the LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in either factorization.**\n\n**Let's list the primes and their highest powers:**\n1. **Prime 2:**  \n   - 135 has no 2s.\n   - 468 has \\( 2^2 \\).\n   - **Take \\( 2^2 \\).**\n  \n2. **Prime 3:**  \n   - 135 has \\( 3^3 \\).\n   - 468 has \\( 3^2 \\).\n   - **Take \\( 3^3 \\).**\n  \n3. **Prime 5:**  \n   - 135 has \\( 5^1 \\).\n   - 468 has no 5s.\n   - **Take \\( 5^1 \\).**\n  \n4. **Prime 13:**  \n   - 135 has no 13s.\n   - 468 has \\( 13^1 \\).\n   - **Take \\( 13^1 \\).**\n\n**So, the LCM is:**  \n\\[ 2^2 \u00d7 3^3 \u00d7 5^1 \u00d7 13^1 \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Let's multiply these together step by step:**\n  \n  1. **\\( 2^2 = 4 \\)**\n  2. **\\( 3^3 = 27 \\)**\n  3. **\\( 5^1 = 5 \\)**\n  4. **\\( 13^1 = 13 \\)**\n\n  **Multiply them together:**\n  \n  - \\( 4 \u00d7 27 = 108 \\)\n  - \\( 108 \u00d7 5 = 540 \\)\n  - \\( 540 \u00d7 13 = 7,020 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait a second...** That number seems pretty big. But then again, LCMs can get large. **Let me quickly check the calculations to be sure.**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Multiply 4 \u00d7 27 again:**  \n  - \\( 4 \u00d7 20 = 80 \\)\n  - \\( 4 \u00d7 7 = 28 \\)\n  - \\( 80 + 28 = 108 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  \n- **Now multiply 108 \u00d7 5:**  \n  - \\( 100 \u00d7 5 = 500 \\)\n  - \\( 8 \u00d7 5 = 40 \\)\n  - \\( 500 + 40 = 540 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  \n- **Finally, 540 \u00d7 13:**  \n  - \\( 540 \u00d7 10 = 5,400 \\)\n  - \\( 540 \u00d7 3 = 1,620 \\)\n  - \\( 5,400 + 1,620 = 7,020 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Okay, the calculations seem correct.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Cross-Checking with Another Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Just to make sure, let's check if using the GCD approach gives the same result.** It's always good to verify using a different method.\n\n**Recall the relationship between LCM and GCD:**\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) \u00d7 \\text{GCD}(a, b) = a \u00d7 b \\]  \nWhere:\n- \\( a = 135 \\)\n- \\( b = 468 \\)\n\n**Step 1: Find the GCD of 135 and 468.**\n\n**Exploring GCD using Prime Factorization:**\n- **135:** \\( 3^3 \u00d7 5 \\)\n- **468:** \\( 2^2 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 13 \\)\n  \n**Common prime factors with the lowest powers:**\n- **2:** Not common.\n- **3:** \\( \\min(3^3, 3^2) = 3^2 \\)\n- **5:** Not common.\n- **13:** Not common.\n\n**So, the GCD is:**  \n\\[ 3^2 = 9 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Use the GCD to find LCM.**\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM} = \\frac{a \u00d7 b}{\\text{GCD}} = \\frac{135 \u00d7 468}{9} \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **First, multiply 135 and 468:**\n  \n  - \\( 135 \u00d7 468 = 630 \u00d7 468 \\)\n  - But let me break it down for easier calculation:\n    \n    - \\( 135 \u00d7 400 = 54,000 \\)\n    - \\( 135 \u00d7 60 = 8,100 \\)\n    - \\( 135 \u00d7 8 = 1,080 \\)\n    \n    - **Adding them up:**  \n      \\( 54,000 + 8,100 + 1,080 = 63,180 \\)\n  \n- **Now, divide by the GCD (9):**\n  \n  \\( \\frac{63,180}{9} = 7,020 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Ah, interesting!** Both methods\u2014prime factorization and the GCD approach\u2014yield the same LCM: **7,020**.\n- **This reinforces that the answer is likely correct.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Let's reflect on the entire process to ensure everything makes sense.**\n- **Did both methods agree on the LCM?**\n- **Are the calculations verified and correct?**\n- **Is there anything that feels off?**\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Both methods gave the same LCM: 7,020.**\n- **The prime factorization was straightforward, and the GCD approach also confirmed the result.**\n- **Calculations were checked step by step, and they all align.**\n- **I don't see any inconsistencies or errors.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **The least common multiple of 135 and 468 is indeed **7,020.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Throughout the process, it was helpful to brainstorm different strategies.**\n- **Starting with prime factorization gave me a clear view of the numbers' components.**\n- **Using the GCD relationship confirmed the result and provided a second verification.**\n- **Checking calculations at each step ensured accuracy.**\n- **It's always good to cross-check using different methods, especially when dealing with larger numbers.**\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n- **For finding LCM, both prime factorization and the GCD method are effective. Choosing one depends on personal preference and the specific numbers involved. Always verify calculations and consider multiple approaches to ensure correctness.**\n\n---\n\nBy reflecting on each step, exploring various strategies, and confirming results through multiple methods, I've arrived confidently at the solution: the **least common multiple of 135 and 468 is 7,020**.",
