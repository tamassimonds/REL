I'll emulating a human-like thought process\u2014complete with brainstorming, exploring different methods, checking for correctness, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\nOkay, looking at this problem, my first impression is that it's about finding values of \\(x\\) that might cause issues in the domain of the function \\(f(x)\\):\n\n\\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{|x^2 + 3x - 4| + |x^2 + 9x + 20|}\\]\n\nThe denominator involves absolute values of quadratic expressions. \n\n**Feeling Confused:**\nWait, absolute values are involved here. I remember that usually, functions like this have problems when the denominator equals zero because that would make the function undefined. But with absolute values, maybe the quadratics inside can't be negative, which could also be an issue.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n1. **Check Where Denominator is Zero:**\n   - Maybe find \\(x\\) where \\(|x^2 + 3x - 4| + |x^2 + 9x + 20| = 0\\). But since absolute values are always non-negative, this seems impossible unless both expressions are zero.\n\n2. **Investigate Quadratic Expressions:**\n   - Perhaps analyze the roots of \\(x^2 + 3x - 4\\) and \\(x^2 + 9x + 20\\) to see if they can ever equal zero.\n\n3. **Consider Function Behavior:**\n   - Look at the overall behavior of \\(f(x)\\) to see if there are any restrictions on \\(x\\).\n\n**Deciding on First Approach:**\nLet me start by checking where each quadratic expression inside the absolute values equals zero. If the absolute values can't be zero, maybe that's where the function is defined.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Find Roots of Quadratic Expressions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf \\(|x^2 + 3x - 4| = 0\\), then \\(x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0\\). Similarly for the second expression. Let's find the roots.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **Solve \\(x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0\\):**\n   - Using the quadratic formula:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-4)}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve \\(x^2 + 9x + 20 = 0\\):**\n   - Again, using the quadratic formula:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-9 \\pm \\sqrt{9^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 20}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-9 \\pm \\sqrt{81 - 80}}{2} = \\frac{-9 \\pm 1}{2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-10}{2} = -5\n     \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, both quadratics have roots at \\(x = -4\\). The first one also has a root at \\(x = 1\\). So, \\(x = -4\\) is a common root.\n\n**Connecting the Dots:**\nI recall that for \\(f(x)\\) to be defined, the denominator must not be zero. Since both quadratics equal zero at \\(x = -4\\), this point could be problematic.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate the Denominator at Critical Points**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's check what happens at \\(x = -4\\):\n\\[\n|x^2 + 3x - 4| + |x^2 + 9x + 20|\n\\]\nIf this equals zero, then \\(f(x)\\) is undefined.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **Evaluate \\(x^2 + 3x - 4\\) at \\(x = -4\\):**\n   \\[\n   (-4)^2 + 3(-4) - 4 = 16 - 12 - 4 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   |0| = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate \\(x^2 + 9x + 20\\) at \\(x = -4\\):**\n   \\[\n   (-4)^2 + 9(-4) + 20 = 16 - 36 + 20 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   |0| = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum of Absolute Values:**\n   \\[\n   |x^2 + 3x - 4| + |x^2 + 9x + 20| = 0 + 0 = 0\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOh no! At \\(x = -4\\), both expressions inside the absolute values are zero, making the denominator zero. This means \\(f(-4)\\) is undefined.\n\n**Conclusion So Far:**\nIt seems that \\(x = -4\\) is not in the domain of \\(f(x)\\) because it makes the denominator zero. But I only checked one point. Should I consider other points or verify if this is the only issue?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Check for Other Potential Domain Issues**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI should consider whether there are other values of \\(x\\) that might cause the denominator to be zero or undefined. Since absolute values can't be negative, the quadratics inside can only affect the domain if they equal zero.\n\n**Exploring Further:**\nBut wait, since \\(|a| = 0\\) only if \\(a = 0\\), the only points that could make the denominator zero are exactly the roots of the quadratics.\n\n**Deciding to Move Forward:**\nGiven that both quadratics have real roots and we've identified \\(x = -4\\) as a problematic point, I think it's safe to conclude that \\(x = -4\\) is the only real value causing issues in the domain.\n\n**Checking for Mistakes:**\nLet me quickly review:\n- Both quadratics equal zero at \\(x = -4\\).\n- At \\(x = -4\\), the denominator becomes zero, making \\(f(x)\\) undefined.\n- No other roots were found in the quadratics that are real and distinct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIt seems that \\(x = -4\\) is the only real value not in the domain of \\(f(x)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Rechecking Everything:**\n- Checked the roots of both quadratics: \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -4\\) for the first, \\(x = -4\\) and \\(x = -5\\) for the second.\n- Confirmed that at \\(x = -4\\), both quadratics give zero, leading to a zero denominator.\n- No other real values from the quadratics cause the denominator to be zero.\n\n**Natural Check:**\nDoes it make sense? Yes, because only \\(x = -4\\) makes both absolute value expressions inside the denominator zero.\n\n**Moment of Truth:**\nAm I confident in this solution? Given the calculations and checks, I believe \\(x = -4\\) is indeed the only point not in the domain.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe only real value of \\(x\\) not in the domain of \n\n\\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{|x^2 + 3x - 4| + |x^2 + 9x + 20|}\\]\n\nis \n\n\\[\\boxed{-4}\\]\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy systematically identifying the roots of the quadratic expressions inside the absolute values, I determined that \\(x = -4\\) is the only point where the denominator becomes zero, making \\(f(x)\\) undefined. Throughout the process, I checked my work, reflected on the validity of each step, and ensured that no other real values posed a problem in the domain. This approach led me to confidently conclude that \\(x = -4\\) is the sole real value not in the domain of \\(f(x)\\).",
