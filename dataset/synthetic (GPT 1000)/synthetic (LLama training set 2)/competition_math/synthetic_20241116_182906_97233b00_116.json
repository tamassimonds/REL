    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a natural human thought process. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check if my approach makes sense. Let's see where it takes us!\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\nCompute \\( -8 \\cdot 4 - (-6 \\cdot -3) + (-10 \\cdot -5) \\).\n\nMy initial reaction is to:\n\n- **Identify the Operations:** There are multiplications and additions/subtractions involved.\n- **Recall Order of Operations:** I remember that operations should be performed in a specific order\u2014parentheses first (if there were any), then multiplication/division, and finally addition/subtraction.\n- **Think About Negatives:** Multiplying negative numbers can be tricky, so I need to be careful with signs.\n\nBut honestly, it's a bit overwhelming at first glance. I think, \"This looks like a straightforward computation, but maybe grouping the terms could help.\"\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Compute Each Multiplication Separately:** Handle the multiplications one at a time and then perform the addition and subtraction.\n   \n2. **Group Negative Products Together:** Maybe it's easier to deal with the negative products first to avoid confusion with signs later.\n\n3. **Use Associative and Commutative Properties:** Perhaps rearranging or regrouping the terms could simplify the calculations.\n\nI think starting with computing each multiplication separately makes the most sense. It feels like the most direct approach. If things get messy, I can reconsider.\n\n### **Step 1: Compute Each Multiplication**\n\nLet's tackle each multiplication one at a time:\n\n1. **First Term:**  \n   \\[ -8 \\cdot 4 = -32 \\]  \n   *Thought:* Multiplying a negative by a positive should give a negative result. This checks out.\n\n2. **Second Term:**  \n   \\[ -6 \\cdot -3 = 18 \\]  \n   *Reflection:* Multiplying two negatives gives a positive. That aligns with what I remember.\n\n3. **Third Term:**  \n   \\[ -10 \\cdot -5 = 50 \\]  \n   *Check:* Again, two negatives multiply to a positive. Seems correct.\n\nAt this point, I have:\n\n\\[ -32 - 18 + 50 \\]\n\n### **Step 2: Simplify the Expression**\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression step by step:\n\n1. **Handle Subtraction First:**  \n   \\[ -32 - 18 = -50 \\]  \n   *Quick Check:* Subtracting 18 from -32 makes sense; -32 minus 20 is -52, minus 2 more is -50. This feels right.\n\n2. **Add the Positive Term:**  \n   \\[ -50 + 50 = 0 \\]  \n   *Reflection:* Adding 50 to -50 brings me back to zero. That seems like the correct final step.\n\n### **Step 3: Verify the Approach**\n\nLet me pause and reflect if this approach makes sense:\n\n- **Does Each Step Check Out?** Yes, each multiplication was straightforward, and the addition/subtraction followed the correct order.\n- **Could There Be a Mistake?** I briefly consider if I mishandled any signs, but everything aligns with basic multiplication rules.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Grouping Negative Products**\n\nJust to make sure, let's see if grouping the negative products would yield the same result:\n\n1. **Group Second and Third Terms:**  \n   \\[ -(-6 \\cdot -3) + (-10 \\cdot -5) = 18 + 50 = 68 \\]  \n   *Thought:* Wait, this seems off because I wouldn't be adding 18 and 50 directly here. The original expression has a minus before the second term.\n\n2. **Reconsider Grouping:** Perhaps grouping wasn't the best idea here. The initial method was more straightforward.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nGoing back to the initial method:\n\n\\[ -8 \\cdot 4 - (-6 \\cdot -3) + (-10 \\cdot -5) = 0 \\]\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy computing each multiplication separately and carefully handling the addition and subtraction, I arrived at the final answer of **0**. Throughout the process, checking each step ensured that the approach was correct, and considering alternative strategies helped confirm the validity of the initial method. Always reflecting and verifying along the way kept me on the right track.",

  "ground_truth": "The order of operations says that we must perform the multiplication before the addition and subtraction.  Recall that ``negative times positive equals negative\" and ``negative times negative equals positive\".
