    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just like how I would naturally approach it if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I'm thinking: \"What's being asked here?\" The problem mentions finding the **product of the coordinates of the midpoint** of a line segment with given endpoints. \n\n- **Brainstorming:** Okay, this reminds me of finding midpoints in geometry. I recall there\u2019s a midpoint formula involving averaging the coordinates of the endpoints. But then I think, \"Wait, is that the only part?\" The term **product** throws me off a bit\u2014does it mean multiplying the coordinates together after finding the midpoint? \n\n- **Alternative Ideas:** Maybe after finding the midpoint, I need to consider something else, but looking at similar problems in the past, it's usually straightforward. Let me stick with the midpoint formula for now and see where it leads.\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:** \n  1. **Use the Midpoint Formula:** This seems like the most direct approach.\n  2. **Visual Representation:** Sketch the line segment on a coordinate plane to better understand.\n  3. **Check With Distance Formula:** Ensure the calculations make sense by checking distances.\n\nThinking about it, starting with the **midpoint formula** makes the most sense. If that leads me to an incorrect path, I can reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Midpoint Formula**\n\nOkay, let's go ahead with the midpoint formula:\n\n- **Midpoint Formula:** \n  \\[\n  \\text{Midpoint} = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Given Points:**\n  \\[\n  (1, 1) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (-7, 5)\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculations:**\n\n  - For the **x-coordinate**:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{1 + (-7)}{2} = \\frac{-6}{2} = -3\n    \\]\n    \n  - For the **y-coordinate**:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{1 + 5}{2} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n    \\]\n    \n- **Result:**\n  \n  So, the **midpoint** is \\((-3, 3)\\).\n\n**Reflection:** Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me quickly check:  \n- Adding \\(1\\) and \\(-7\\) gives \\(-6\\), divided by \\(2\\) is \\(-3\\)\u2014seems correct.  \n- Adding \\(1\\) and \\(5\\) gives \\(6\\), divided by \\(2\\) is \\(3\\)\u2014also looks good.\n\n**Quick Check:** Both coordinates make sense. I think this part is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Product of the Midpoint Coordinates**\n\nNow, the question asks for the **product** of these coordinates. Let's proceed:\n\n- **Product Calculation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  -3 \\times 3 = -9\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:** Multiplying \\(-3\\) and \\(3\\) gives \\(-9\\). That seems straightforward. But let me think\u2014does it make sense to ask for the product here? The problem mentioned \"product of the coordinates,\" so multiplying them after finding the midpoint seems right.\n\n**Check:** The operations are simple, and the numbers check out. I'm confident in this step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\nAt this point, I want to ensure that my approach is correct. Let's reflect:\n\n- **Did I interpret the question correctly?** \n  - Yes, the user asked for the product of the coordinates of the midpoint. \n\n- **Is the midpoint calculation correct?**\n  - Checked and seems accurate.\n\n- **Does finding the product make sense?**\n  - Given the question, multiplying the coordinates is what\u2019s being asked.\n\n**Final Thought:** Everything aligns with the problem's requirements. The midpoint is calculated correctly, and the product of the coordinates makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Alternative Strategies**\n\nEven though my initial approach worked, let's brainstorm if there's another way to verify my solution:\n\n- **Alternative Method:** \n  - **Visualize the Line Segment:** Maybe sketching it could help confirm the midpoint.\n  - **Distance Check:** Use the distance formula to see if the midpoint divides the segment equally.\n\n**Exploring:** I start by thinking about sketching the line segment, but then I realize it might take extra time. Also, checking with the distance formula seems unnecessary since the midpoint formula should already ensure it's correct.\n\n**Decision:** Stick with the midpoint formula and product calculation since that's the most direct method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Verification**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's do a quick sanity check:\n\n- **Does the midpoint lie between the two endpoints?**\n  - For \\(x\\)-coordinates: \\(1\\) and \\(-7\\) -> Midpoint \\(x\\) is \\(-3\\) \u2192 Correct.\n  - For \\(y\\)-coordinates: \\(1\\) and \\(5\\) -> Midpoint \\(y\\) is \\(3\\) \u2192 Correct.\n\n- **Is the product logically reasonable?**\n  - Multiplying \\(-3\\) and \\(3\\) gives \\(-9\\), which is a plausible result.\n\n**Reflection:** Everything checks out. The midpoint calculation is correct, and the product aligns with the question's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully walking through the problem, exploring different strategies, and verifying each step, the **product of the coordinates of the midpoint** is \\(\\boxed{-9}\\).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** By starting with the midpoint formula, verifying each calculation, and reflecting on whether the approach made sense, I was able to arrive confidently at the correct solution. Even though initial brainstorming led me to consider alternative methods, sticking with the most straightforward strategy proved effective. Checking and reflecting throughout ensured accuracy and helped catch any potential missteps early on.",
