If the circumferences of the two circles differ by \\(10\\pi\\) feet, how wide is the track in feet?\"**\n\nThinking about it, I immediately recognize that this involves the properties of circles. The term \"concentric\" means that the circles share the same center but have different radii. So, we're dealing with two circles, and the difference in their circumferences is given.\n\nAt first glance, this feels like a problem involving the formulas for the circumference of a circle. I remember that the circumference \\(C\\) is related to the radius \\(r\\) by the formula:\n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nSince both circles have the same center, the difference in their circumferences is directly related to the difference in their radii. \n\nBut wait, let me explore this a bit more to make sure. \n\n- **Option 1:** Use the circumference formula directly to relate the two circles.\n- **Option 2:** Perhaps draw a diagram or visualize the setup to better understand the relationship.\n- **Option 3:** Consider if there's another geometric property involved, but for now, the circumference seems most relevant.\n\nI think starting with the circumference formula makes the most sense. But let me write down what I'm thinking to keep track.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Relationship Between Circumferences and Radii\n\nIf the circumferences of the two circles differ by \\(10\\pi\\) feet, that means:\n\n\\[\nC_1 - C_2 = 10\\pi\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C_1\\) is the circumference of the larger circle and \\(C_2\\) is the circumference of the smaller circle.\n\nI recall that:\n\n\\[\nC_1 = 2\\pi r_1 \\\\\nC_2 = 2\\pi r_2\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) are the radii of the larger and smaller circles, respectively.\n\nSubstituting these into the difference equation:\n\n\\[\n2\\pi r_1 - 2\\pi r_2 = 10\\pi\n\\]\n\n### Reflection\n\nHmm, simplifying this equation might reveal something useful.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Equation\n\nLet's factor out the common terms:\n\n\\[\n2\\pi (r_1 - r_2) = 10\\pi\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by \\(2\\pi\\):\n\n\\[\nr_1 - r_2 = 5\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** Okay, this tells me that the difference between the radii of the two circles is 5 feet. That makes sense because if the circles are concentric, the width of the track should be the difference in their radii.\n\n### Step 3: Verifying the Approach\n\nLet me quickly check if this makes sense. The width of the track is indeed the difference in radii, so finding \\(r_1 - r_2 = 5\\) seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about it in another way.\n\n### Alternative Approach: Visualizing the Track\n\n**Option 2:** Maybe drawing a diagram could help confirm this.\n\n- **Drawing Idea:** Sketch two concentric circles; label their radii \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\). Indicate the width of the track as \\(r_1 - r_2\\).\n  \nThis reinforces that the width of the track is indeed the difference between the radii.\n\n### Step 4: Final Check\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure all steps align with the question's requirements.\n\n- **Given:** Circumferences differ by \\(10\\pi\\) feet.\n- **Found:** Difference in radii \\(r_1 - r_2 = 5\\) feet.\n  \nThis matches the problem statement perfectly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying each step, I can confidently conclude that:\n\n**The width of the track is 5 feet.**\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected on the approach, checked for consistency, and even considered an alternative method to ensure the solution's correctness. This step-by-step thinking helped solidify the understanding and validate the final answer.\n\n---\n\nBy mimicking human-like thought processes, including brainstorming, reflecting, and checking, we've navigated through the problem effectively, ensuring accuracy and clarity in the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Call the radius of the outer circle $r_1$ and that of the inner circle $r_2$. The width of the track is $r_1-r_2$. The circumference of a circle is $2\\pi$ times the radius, so the difference in circumferences is $2\\pi r_1-2\\pi r_2=10\\pi$ feet. If we divide each side by $2\\pi$, we get $r_1-r_2=\\boxed{5}$ feet."
