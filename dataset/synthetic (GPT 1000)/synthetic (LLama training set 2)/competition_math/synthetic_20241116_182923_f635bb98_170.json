Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, looking at the problem:\n\n\\[ f(x) = ax + b \\]\n\\[ f^{-1}(x) = bx + a \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( a + b \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Familiarity:** This reminds me of properties of functions and their inverses. I remember that for a function and its inverse, certain relationships hold.\n  \n- **Unknowns:** I'm not immediately sure how to relate \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) given their forms. Typically, I know \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\), but here both functions have coefficients that are switched.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Use the Inverse Function Definition:** Apply \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\) to set up an equation.\n  2. **Express Inverses Differently:** Maybe find a general formula for inverses and see where it leads.\n  3. **Compare Coefficients:** Since both functions are linear, perhaps comparing coefficients after substituting one into the other would help.\n\nAt this stage, I think trying to use the inverse function definition might be a good start. If that doesn't lead anywhere, I can explore other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Inverse Function Definition**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's use the property that composing a function with its inverse returns the identity function:\n\n\\[ f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\]\n\nSubstituting the given functions:\n\n\\[ f(bx + a) = x \\]\n\nThis should help me set up an equation involving \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Substitute \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   f(bx + a) = a(bx + a) + b\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplify:\n\n   \\[\n   = abx + a^2 + b\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the Equation Equal to \\( x \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   abx + a^2 + b = x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rearrange the Equation:**\n\n   Bring all terms to one side:\n\n   \\[\n   abx + a^2 + b - x = 0\n   \\]\n\n   Factor out \\( x \\):\n\n   \\[\n   (ab - 1)x + (a^2 + b) = 0\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, this is interesting. For this equation to hold for all \\( x \\), both coefficients must be zero. That means:\n\n1. \\( ab - 1 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( a^2 + b = 0 \\)\n\nThis gives me two equations to work with. Let's proceed to solve them.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI now have:\n\n1. \\( ab = 1 \\)\n2. \\( a^2 + b = 0 \\)\n\nThis is a system of equations. I can solve it using substitution or elimination. I'll choose substitution since it's straightforward here.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Express \\( b \\) in Terms of \\( a \\):**\n\n   From \\( a^2 + b = 0 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   b = -a^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute \\( b = -a^2 \\) into \\( ab = 1 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   a(-a^2) = 1\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplify:\n\n   \\[\n   -a^3 = 1\n   \\]\n   \n   Multiply both sides by -1:\n\n   \\[\n   a^3 = -1\n   \\]\n   \n   Solving for \\( a \\):\n\n   \\[\n   a = -1\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Find \\( b \\) Using \\( b = -a^2 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   b = -(-1)^2 = -1\n   \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait a minute\u2014both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are -1. Let me quickly verify if this satisfies both original equations.\n\n- **First Equation:** \\( ab = 1 \\)\n\n  \\[\n  (-1)(-1) = 1 \\quad \\text{\u2705}\n  \\]\n\n- **Second Equation:** \\( a^2 + b = 0 \\)\n\n  \\[\n  (-1)^2 + (-1) = 1 - 1 = 0 \\quad \\text{\u2705}\n  \\]\n\nBoth equations are satisfied, so \\( a = -1 \\) and \\( b = -1 \\) are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\( a + b \\)**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nNow that I have \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\na + b = -1 + (-1) = -2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems straightforward, but let me double-check to ensure everything aligns with the problem's requirements. Does this satisfy the condition for inverses? Yes, because substituting back into the original definition confirms it.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Validating the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure the solution is correct, let's verify if the original functions indeed satisfy the property of inverses with these values.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n1. **Given \\( a = -1 \\) and \\( b = -1 \\), the functions become:**\n\n   \\[\n   f(x) = -x - 1\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   f^{-1}(x) = -x - 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Check \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   f(-x - 1) = -(-x - 1) - 1 = x + 1 - 1 = x \\quad \\text{\u2705}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Check \\( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   f^{-1}(-x - 1) = -(-x - 1) - 1 = x + 1 - 1 = x \\quad \\text{\u2705}\n   \\]\n\nBoth compositions return \\( x \\), confirming that \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) are indeed inverses.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and reflecting throughout the process, the value of \\( a + b \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with constant checks and validations, ensured that the solution was correct and aligned with the properties of inverse functions.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$, it follows that $a(bx+a)+b=x$, which implies $abx + a^2 +b = x$. This equation holds for all values of $x$ only if $ab=1$ and $a^2+b=0$.\n\nThen $b = -a^2$.  Substituting into the equation $ab = 1$, we get $-a^3 = 1$.  Then $a = -1$, so $b = -1$, and  \\[f(x)=-x-1.\\]Likewise  \\[f^{-1}(x)=-x-1.\\]These are inverses to one another since  \\[f(f^{-1}(x))=-(-x-1)-1=x+1-1=x.\\]\\[f^{-1}(f(x))=-(-x-1)-1=x+1-1=x.\\]Therefore $a+b=\\boxed{-2}$."
