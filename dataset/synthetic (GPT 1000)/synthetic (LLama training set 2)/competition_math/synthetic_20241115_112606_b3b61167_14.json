I need to find the **height** of the cylinder. This reminds me of the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which involves both the radius and the height. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- **Formula Recall:** The volume of a cylinder \\( V \\) is given by \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height.\n- **Given Information:** I have the volume \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cubic cm and the radius \\( r = 3 \\) cm.\n- **Goal:** I need to solve for the height \\( h \\).\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n- **Direct Calculation Using Volume Formula:** Plug the known values into the volume formula and solve for \\( h \\).\n- **Check Units and Values:** Ensure that the units and numeric values make sense after calculation.\n- **Reflection:** Since I have the radius and the volume, it seems straightforward to use the volume formula directly.\n\n**Wait...**  \nLet me briefly check if using the formula is the most efficient way. Given that both radius and volume are provided, it seems logical to proceed directly with the volume formula.\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Volume Formula\n\nNow, I'll use the volume formula to find the height. \n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Formula Setup:** Start with the volume formula:  \n  \\[\n  V = \\pi r^2 h\n  \\]\n- **Plug in Known Values:** Substitute \\( V = 45\\pi \\) and \\( r = 3 \\) into the formula.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Simplification:**\n- **First, simplify \\( (3)^2 \\):**  \n  \\[\n  (3)^2 = 9\n  \\]\n- **Substitute back into the equation:**  \n  \\[\n  45\\pi = \\pi \\times 9 \\times h\n  \\]\n- **Cancel out \\( \\pi \\) from both sides:**  \n  \\[\n  45 = 9h\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Cancelling \\( \\pi \\) is valid since it's a common factor on both sides.\n- **Is this correct?** Yes, simplifying like this is standard practice when solving for \\( h \\).\n\n### Step 3: Solving for Height \\( h \\)\n\nContinuing from the simplified equation:\n\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Solving for \\( h \\):** To isolate \\( h \\), divide both sides by 9.\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  h = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n  \\]\n  \n**Check:**\n- **Does this make sense?** The height comes out to be 5 cm, which seems reasonable given the volume and radius provided.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Solution\n\nBefore finalizing, let's verify if the calculated height makes sense with the given volume.\n\n**Verification Using Volume Formula:**\n- **Recalculate Volume with \\( h = 5 \\) cm:**  \n  \\[\n  V = \\pi r^2 h = \\pi \\times 3^2 \\times 5 = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 5 = 45\\pi\n  \\]\n  \n**Wait...**\n- **Does the recalculated volume match the given volume?** Yes, \\( 45\\pi \\) cubic cm matches perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **The calculated height is correct.** The volume checks out with the given values, confirming that \\( h = 5 \\) cm is the right answer.\n\n### Step 5: Reflecting on the Approach\n\n**Was this the best strategy?**\n- **Direct Application Worked:** Using the volume formula directly was straightforward and efficient since both volume and radius were known.\n- **Alternative Methods:** Could have explored rearranging formulas or verifying with different strategies, but the direct approach was effective.\n\n**Check for Potential Mistakes:**\n- **Unit Consistency:** All units were consistent (cm for radius and height, cm\u00b3 for volume).\n- **Calculation Steps:** Each step followed logically, with no skipped or incorrect operations.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n- **Approach Validated:** The steps led to a correct and logical conclusion, ensuring that the calculated height is accurate.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n**The height of the cylinder is \\( h = 5 \\) centimeters.**\n\n---\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, verifying calculations, and ensuring unit consistency, I've confidently arrived at the correct height for the cylinder.",
