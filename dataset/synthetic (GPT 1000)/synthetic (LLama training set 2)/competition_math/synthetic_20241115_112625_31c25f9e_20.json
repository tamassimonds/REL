I'll brainstorm, reflect, check my work often, and adjust my approach as needed. Just like a human, I'll show all the messy parts, doubts, and \"aha\" moments along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, the problem asks how many ordered pairs \\((x, y)\\) of positive integers satisfy the equation \\(xy = 144\\).\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:**\n  - When I see \\(xy = 144\\), it reminds me of finding factors. Each pair \\((x, y)\\) would be a pair of factors of 144.\n  - I recall that ordered pairs mean the order matters, so \\((x, y)\\) is different from \\((y, x)\\) unless \\(x = y\\).\n  - I'm not entirely sure if there are other methods, but factoring seems like a solid starting point.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Factorization Approach:** List all pairs of factors of 144.\n  2. **Prime Factorization:** Break down 144 into its prime factors and use combinatorial reasoning.\n  3. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Solve for \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\) and find integer solutions.\n  4. **Graphical Method:** Though less common for integer solutions, graphing \\(xy = 144\\) could provide insights.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** \n  - I'm leaning towards the Factorization Approach since it's straightforward.\n  - But I'm also considering Prime Factorization to verify or potentially find a quicker method.\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting the Factorization Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's start by listing all the positive integer pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x \\times y = 144\\). This should give us the total number of ordered pairs.\n\n**Action:**\n- List all factor pairs of 144.\n- Since the order matters, each pair will have two permutations unless \\(x = y\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n- First, find all factors of 144.\n  \n  \\[\n  144 = 12 \\times 12\n  \\]\n  \n  - Factors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 144\n\n- **Possible Ordered Pairs:**\n  - \\( (1, 144) \\)\n  - \\( (2, 72) \\)\n  - \\( (3, 48) \\)\n  - \\( (4, 36) \\)\n  - \\( (6, 24) \\)\n  - \\( (8, 18) \\)\n  - \\( (9, 16) \\)\n  - \\( (12, 12) \\)\n  \n- **Total Unique Unordered Pairs:** \\( \\frac{15 \\text{ (factors)} - 1 \\text{ (since } 12 \\times 12 \\text{ is repeated)}}{2} = 7 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, I initially counted all unique pairs, but since we need ordered pairs, each unique unordered pair gives two ordered pairs (except when \\(x = y\\)).\n- So, multiply by 2 for each pair except \\((12, 12)\\).\n\n**Adjusted Calculation:**\n- **Total Ordered Pairs:**\n  - All unique unordered pairs except \\((12, 12)\\) give 2 ordered pairs each.\n  - \\( 7 \\text{ (unordered pairs)} \\times 2 = 14 \\)\n  - Plus the pair \\((12, 12)\\) which only counts once as \\((12, 12)\\).\n  - Total = \\( 14 + 1 = 15 \\)\n\n**Check:**\n- Does \\(15\\) make sense? Let's list them explicitly to be sure.\n\n**Explicit Listing:**\n- \\( (1, 144), (144, 1) \\)\n- \\( (2, 72), (72, 2) \\)\n- \\( (3, 48), (48, 3) \\)\n- \\( (4, 36), (36, 4) \\)\n- \\( (6, 24), (24, 6) \\)\n- \\( (8, 18), (18, 8) \\)\n- \\( (9, 16), (16, 9) \\)\n- \\( (12, 12) \\)\n\n- **Total:** \\( 14 + 1 = 15 \\)\n\n**Realization:**\n- The Factorization Approach seems correct, giving us \\(15\\) ordered pairs.\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying with Prime Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nEven though the first method worked, let's cross-check using Prime Factorization to ensure accuracy. This might also provide a different perspective or verify the correctness of our previous method.\n\n**Action:**\n- Break down 144 into its prime factors.\n- Use combinatorial reasoning to count the distinct factor pairs.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Prime Factorization of 144:**\n  \n  \\[\n  144 = 2^4 \\times 3^2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Determining Number of Factors:**\n  - Add 1 to each exponent and multiply:\n    \n    \\[\n    (4 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\text{ factors}\n    \\]\n    \n- **Applying Complement Principle:**\n  - Each factor \\(d\\) less than \\(\\sqrt{144} = 12\\) corresponds to a unique factor \\( \\frac{144}{d} \\) greater than 12.\n  - Ordered pairs are constructed as \\( (d, \\frac{144}{d}) \\) and \\( (\\frac{144}{d}, d) \\), except when \\(d = 12\\).\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n1. List all factors less than or equal to 12:\n   - \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12\\)\n\n2. Pair each with its complement:\n   - \\( (1, 144), (2, 72), (3, 48), (4, 36), (6, 24), (8, 18), (9, 16), (12, 12) \\)\n   \n3. Count ordered pairs:\n   - Each pair \\( (d, \\frac{144}{d}) \\) contributes two ordered pairs.\n   - Except for \\( (12, 12) \\), which contributes only one.\n\n**Adjusted Calculation:**\n- **Total Ordered Pairs:**\n  - \\( 7 \\text{ (unique pairs)} \\times 2 = 14 \\)\n  - Plus the pair \\((12, 12)\\) = \\(14 + 1 = 15\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This method also confirms that there are \\(15\\) ordered pairs.\n- The Prime Factorization approach aligns with the Factorization Approach, providing a consistent result.\n\n**Check:**\n- Let's list the pairs again to ensure completeness:\n\n  - \\( (1, 144), (144, 1) \\)\n  - \\( (2, 72), (72, 2) \\)\n  - \\( (3, 48), (48, 3) \\)\n  - \\( (4, 36), (36, 4) \\)\n  - \\( (6, 24), (24, 6) \\)\n  - \\( (8, 18), (18, 8) \\)\n  - \\( (9, 16), (16, 9) \\)\n  - \\( (12, 12) \\)\n\n- **Total:** \\(15\\)\n\n**Final Realization:**\n- Both methods\u2014Factorization and Prime Factorization\u2014yield the same result: \\(15\\) ordered pairs.\n- This consistency adds confidence that the solution is correct.\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Alternative Methods**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nWhile both methods above worked, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem to ensure we're not missing anything. It's always good to explore different strategies, especially in problem-solving.\n\n**Possible Alternative Strategies:**\n1. **Algebraic Manipulation:** Solve \\(y = \\frac{144}{x}\\) and find integer solutions.\n2. **Graphical Approach:** Graph \\(xy = 144\\) and identify lattice points.\n\n**Action:**\n- Let's try the Algebraic Manipulation method first.\n\n#### **Attempting Algebraic Manipulation**\n\n**Action:**\n- Solve the equation for \\(y\\): \\(y = \\frac{144}{x}\\)\n- Since \\(y\\) must be a positive integer, \\(x\\) must be a divisor of 144.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- We've already identified that the factors of 144 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 144.\n- Each factor \\(x\\) corresponds to a unique \\(y = \\frac{144}{x}\\).\n\n**Counting Ordered Pairs:**\n- For each divisor \\(x\\), there are two ordered pairs \\((x, y)\\) and \\((y, x)\\), except when \\(x = y\\) (i.e., \\(x = y = 12\\)).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This method reinforces our previous strategies, confirming that each divisor pair contributes to the total count of ordered pairs.\n- However, it seems to reiterate the Factorization Approach rather than providing a new insight.\n\n**Check:**\n- Let's list out the pairs again to ensure accuracy:\n  \n  - \\( (1, 144), (144, 1) \\)\n  - \\( (2, 72), (72, 2) \\)\n  - \\( (3, 48), (48, 3) \\)\n  - \\( (4, 36), (36, 4) \\)\n  - \\( (6, 24), (24, 6) \\)\n  - \\( (8, 18), (18, 8) \\)\n  - \\( (9, 16), (16, 9) \\)\n  - \\( (12, 12) \\)\n\n- **Total:** \\(15\\)\n\n#### **Attempting Graphical Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Graphing \\(xy = 144\\) would show hyperbolas.\n- Identifying integer solutions (lattice points) would correspond to our ordered pairs.\n\n**Action:**\n- Sketch the graph of \\(xy = 144\\).\n- Identify points where both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This approach visually confirms our previous methods.\n- However, without a systematic counting method, it might be less efficient than factorization.\n\n**Check:**\n- By visually inspecting the graph, we can see that every divisor pair corresponds to a lattice point on the curve.\n- This aligns with our earlier calculations.\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThrough multiple strategies\u2014Factorization, Prime Factorization, Algebraic Manipulation, and Graphical Approach\u2014we've consistently arrived at the same total: \\(15\\) ordered pairs. This consistency strengthens the validity of our solution.\n\n**Realization:**\n- Exploring different methods helps verify the correctness of our answer.\n- Factorization remains the most straightforward approach, while Prime Factorization provides a quick verification.\n- Alternative methods, while insightful, may not offer significant advantages over the primary strategies used.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Listing all ordered pairs confirms that \\(15\\) is indeed the correct count.\n- Multiple approaches yield the same result, ensuring accuracy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are **15** ordered pairs \\((x, y)\\) of positive integers that satisfy the equation \\(xy = 144\\).\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough captures the human-like problem-solving process, complete with brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting, checking work, and adapting approaches as needed.
