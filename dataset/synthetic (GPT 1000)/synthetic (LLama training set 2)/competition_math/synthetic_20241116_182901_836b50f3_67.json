    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through like a real human would. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, exploring each one, reflecting on whether it's working, and adjusting my approach as needed. I'll also check my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n## **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see that Crystal wants to select a meal consisting of **one entree, one drink, and one dessert** from her favorites listed in a table. My initial reaction is that this involves counting the number of distinct combinations possible within each category (entree, drink, dessert). It seems like a **combinatorial problem**, which reminds me of problems involving permutations and combinations.\n\nBut then I notice something peculiar: **some categories have fewer options than others**, and I wonder if that affects the total number of distinct meals she can create. Let me brainstorm a bit about how to approach this:\n\n- **Option 1:** Multiply the number of choices in each category. This seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that all categories are considered correctly.\n\n- **Option 2:** List out all possible combinations manually. This could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially if there are many options.\n\n- **Option 3:** Use a systematic method like a tree diagram or a table to organize the combinations. This might help visualize the problem better.\n\n- **Option 4:** Consider combinations and permutations separately to see if one applies better than the other.\n\nHonestly, **Option 1** (multiplying the number of choices) feels like the quickest way to get an answer, but I'm not entirely sure if I need to account for anything specific like overlapping choices or if some combinations are invalid.\n\nLet me think this through: each meal must consist of one item from each category, so as long as we're only considering valid combinations (one from each category), multiplying should work. But wait, I need to ensure that every category has at least one option; otherwise, the multiplication wouldn't make sense.\n\n## **Exploring Strategy 1: Multiplying the Number of Choices**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's start with Option 1: Multiply the number of choices in each category.\n\n- **Entrees:** 4 options (Pizza, Chicken Teriyaki, Corn Dog, Fish and Chips)\n- **Drinks:** 2 options (Lemonade, Root Beer)\n- **Desserts:** 2 options (Frozen Yogurt, Chocolate Chip Cookie)\n\nSo, the total number of distinct possible meals would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Meals} = (\\text{Number of Entrees}) \\times (\\text{Number of Drinks}) \\times (\\text{Number of Desserts}) = 4 \\times 2 \\times 2\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 2 = 8 \\\\\n8 \\times 2 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAt first glance, **16** seems like a plausible number of distinct meals. However, I need to double-check whether this calculation accounts for all possible combinations correctly.\n\n## **Checking Work: Does This Make Sense?**\n\nI'm pausing to reflect: Does multiplying the number of choices in each category cover all possible distinct meals? \n\n- Each meal consists of **one entree, one drink, and one dessert**. \n- By multiplying, I'm assuming that each choice is independent of the others.\n- There's nothing in the problem stating that certain combinations are invalid (e.g., a specific drink can't go with a certain entree).\n\nGiven these points, **it seems logical** that multiplying the number of choices in each category gives the correct total number of distinct meals.\n\n## **Alternative Strategy: Listing Out Combinations**\n\nJust to be sure, let's consider using **Option 2**: Listing out all possible combinations manually. This will help verify the multiplication method.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Start with Entrees:** For each entree, list all possible drinks and desserts combinations.\n- **Organize the combinations:** Maybe use a table or a list to ensure all combinations are accounted for.\n\n**Attempting Option 2:**\n\nLet me try listing the combinations:\n\n1. **Pizza**\n   - Lemonade\n     - Frozen Yogurt\n     - Chocolate Chip Cookie\n   - Root Beer\n     - Frozen Yogurt\n     - Chocolate Chip Cookie\n\n2. **Chicken Teriyaki**\n   - Lemonade\n     - Frozen Yogurt\n     - Chocolate Chip Cookie\n   - Root Beer\n     - Frozen Yogurt\n     - Chocolate Chip Cookie\n\n3. **Corn Dog**\n   - Lemonade\n     - Frozen Yogurt\n     - Chocolate Chip Cookie\n   - Root Beer\n     - Frozen Yogurt\n     - Chocolate Chip Cookie\n\n4. **Fish and Chips**\n   - Lemonade\n     - Frozen Yogurt\n     - Chocolate Chip Cookie\n   - Root Beer\n     - Frozen Yogurt\n     - Chocolate Chip Cookie\n\n**Observation:**\n\nWait, this seems **too repetitive**. Let me think: Each entree has the same set of drink and dessert combinations. Maybe there's a more efficient way to list them.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nInstead of listing every single combination, let's use a **systematic counting approach**:\n\n- For each entree, there are **2 drinks**.\n- For each drink, there are **2 desserts**.\n\nSo, for each entree:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Meals per Entree} = (\\text{Number of Drinks}) \\times (\\text{Number of Desserts}) = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n\\]\n\nSince there are **4 entrees**, the total number of distinct meals is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 4 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis alternative approach aligns with the initial multiplication method. It confirms that the total number of distinct meals is indeed **16**.\n\n## **Final Check: Is the Answer Correct?**\n\nLet's do a quick sanity check:\n\n- **Does the number make sense?** 16 distinct meals seem reasonable given the number of options in each category.\n- **Have all categories been considered?** Yes, each meal consists of one option from each category.\n- **Are there any overlapping or invalid combinations?** No, the problem doesn't indicate any restrictions on combinations.\n\nEverything checks out, so I feel confident that the **final answer is 16**.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the calculations, the total number of distinct possible meals Crystal can buy is **16**. By starting with a straightforward multiplication method and cross-checking with an alternative counting approach, I ensured that the solution is accurate and reflects all possible combinations within the given categories.",

  "ground_truth": "Crystal has $4$ ways to select the entree. Once she has done that, there are $2$ drinks that can go with each entree for a total of $4\\cdot2=8$ ways to select the entree and the drink. For each of the $8$ ways of selecting the first two items, there are $2$ ways to select the dessert for a final answer of $8\\cdot2=\\boxed{16}$ ways to choose the whole meal."
