    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem from the beginning, just like I would if I were working through it myself. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and adjust my approach if needed. Let's make sure our thought process is clear, checking frequently to ensure we're on the right track.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n- **What is being asked?**  \n  We need to find the number of 9-step paths from point \\( E \\) to \\( G \\) that pass through \\( F \\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:**  \n  This reminds me of counting paths in a grid, like those combinatorial problems I've encountered before. It also seems similar to problems involving the binomial coefficient or Pascal's triangle. But wait, the path needs to pass through \\( F \\), so it's not just a straightforward grid path from \\( E \\) to \\( G \\).\n\n- **Uncertainties:**  \n  I'm not entirely sure how to account for the midpoint \\( F \\). Do I break the path into two segments? That might work, but I need to think it through.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Break the Path into Two Segments:**\n   - From \\( E \\) to \\( F \\)\n   - From \\( F \\) to \\( G \\)\n   \n   This seems like a logical approach because passing through \\( F \\) implies making two distinct trips.\n\n2. **Use Combinatorial Counting:**\n   - Calculate the number of ways to reach \\( F \\) and multiply by the number of ways to reach \\( G \\) from \\( F \\).\n\n3. **Consider Different Path Directions:**\n   - Since we're in a grid, maybe account for the number of horizontal and vertical moves needed.\n\n4. **Reflect on the Total Steps:**\n   - Ensure that the sum of steps from \\( E \\) to \\( F \\) and \\( F \\) to \\( G \\) equals 9.\n\n**Let\u2019s start with the first strategy: breaking the path into two segments.**  \nIf that doesn't seem right, we can pivot to another method.\n\n### **Step 1: Determining the Path from \\( E \\) to \\( F \\)**\n\n- **Given Coordinates:**\n  - \\( E(0, 4) \\)\n  - \\( F(3, 3) \\)\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - To move from \\( E \\) to \\( F \\), I need to go 3 steps right (from x=0 to x=3) and 1 step down (from y=4 to y=3).\n  - Total steps needed: 3 right + 1 down = 4 steps.\n\n- **Checking with Total Steps:**\n  - We have a total of 9 steps from \\( E \\) to \\( G \\), so the remaining 9 - 4 = 5 steps must be from \\( F \\) to \\( G \\).\n\n- **Realization:**\n  - This adds up, so it seems correct.\n\n**But let\u2019s double-check:**\n\n- \\( F \\) is at (3, 3), and I need to go to \\( G(5, 0) \\).\n- To move from \\( F \\) to \\( G \\):\n  - 5 - 3 = 2 steps right\n  - 3 - 0 = 3 steps down\n- Total: 2 right + 3 down = 5 steps\n\n**Everything checks out!**\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Number of Paths from \\( E \\) to \\( F \\)**\n\n- **Approach:**\n  - Use combinatorial counting to determine the number of unique sequences of 3 rights and 1 down.\n\n- **Formula:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of paths} = \\binom{n}{k}\n  \\]\n  where \\( n \\) is the total number of steps, and \\( k \\) is the number of steps in one direction.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3! \\times 1!} = 4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Interpretation:**\n  - There are 4 different ways to arrange 3 rights and 1 down.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Computation:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{24}{6 \\times 1} = 4\n  \\]\n  \n- **Validation:**\n  - The math checks out. So, there are indeed 4 distinct paths from \\( E \\) to \\( F \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Number of Paths from \\( F \\) to \\( G \\)**\n\n- **Given Coordinates:**\n  - \\( F(3, 3) \\)\n  - \\( G(5, 0) \\)\n\n- **Needed Moves:**\n  - 2 steps right\n  - 3 steps down\n\n- **Total Steps:**  \n  2 right + 3 down = 5 steps\n\n- **Approach:**\n  - Again, use combinatorial counting to find the number of unique sequences of 2 rights and 3 downs.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2! \\times 3!} = 10\n  \\]\n  \n- **Interpretation:**\n  - There are 10 different ways to arrange 2 rights and 3 downs.\n\n**Sanity Check:**\n\n- **Computation:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{120}{2 \\times 6} = 10\n  \\]\n  \n- **Validation:**\n  - The calculation is correct. Thus, there are 10 distinct paths from \\( F \\) to \\( G \\).\n\n### **Step 4: Combining the Two Segments**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - Since the path from \\( E \\) to \\( G \\) via \\( F \\) consists of two independent segments, the total number of paths is the product of the number of paths for each segment.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total paths} = \\text{Paths from } E \\text{ to } F \\times \\text{Paths from } F \\text{ to } G = 4 \\times 10 = 40\n  \\]\n  \n- **Interpretation:**\n  - There are 40 unique 9-step paths from \\( E \\) to \\( G \\) that pass through \\( F \\).\n\n**Quick Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?**\n  - Yes. Each path from \\( E \\) to \\( G \\) passing through \\( F \\) consists of an \\( E \\) to \\( F \\) segment and an \\( F \\) to \\( G \\) segment.\n  \n- **Check on Total Steps:**\n  - \\( E \\) to \\( F \\): 4 steps\n  - \\( F \\) to \\( G \\): 5 steps\n  - Total: 4 + 5 = 9 steps, which matches the requirement.\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Verifying with Binomial Coefficients**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n  - Maybe there's another way to calculate the total number of paths by considering the entire 9-step journey and the fixed position of \\( F \\).\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total number of paths without restrictions} = \\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9!}{3! \\times 6!} = 84\n  \\]\n  \n- **Entering \\( F \\):**\n  - From \\( E \\) to \\( F \\): 4 steps (3 rights, 1 down)\n  - Validating with binomial:\n    \\[\n    \\binom{4}{3} = 4 \\text{ (paths to \\( F \\))}\n    \\]\n    \n- **Leaving \\( F \\):**\n  - From \\( F \\) to \\( G \\): 5 steps (2 rights, 3 downs)\n  \\[\n  \\binom{5}{2} = 10 \\text{ (paths from \\( F \\) to \\( G \\))}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Total:**\n  \\[\n  4 \\times 10 = 40\n  \\]\n  \n- **Checking Consistency:**\n  - This alternative method also leads to a total of 40 paths, confirming the correctness of our initial approach.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies Confirming the Same Result:**\n  - By breaking the path into two segments and verifying with binomial coefficients, we consistently arrive at the same total: 40 paths.\n\n- **Is the Answer Reasonable?**\n  - Yes, given the grid's structure and the required movements, 40 distinct paths seem plausible.\n\n- **Does the Approach Hold Up?**\n  - Each segment's calculations align with the grid's constraints, and the combinatorial methods are appropriately applied.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying calculations, the total number of 9-step paths from \\( E \\) to \\( G \\) that pass through \\( F \\) is **40**.",
