    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking it through as naturally as possible, just like I would approach it if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect if they're correct, and adjust my approach as needed. The goal is to thoroughly explore and ensure the solution is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n\\[ E = \\left\\lceil{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right\\rceil^2 + \\left\\lceil{\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2}\\right\\rceil \\]\n\nMy initial reaction is a bit mixed. The presence of the **ceiling function** \\( \\lceil \\cdot \\rceil \\) stands out because I've dealt with rounding functions before, but combining it with squaring and fractions makes me pause. \n\n- **Brainstorming:** \n  - Should I evaluate each part separately?\n  - Maybe I need to remember how the ceiling function works with fractions?\n  - Is there a property of ceilings that can simplify the expression?\n\nHonestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Let me jot down what comes to mind:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\):** That\u2019s straightforward\u2014it's 1.5.\n2. **Apply the Ceiling Function:** \\( \\lceil 1.5 \\rceil = 2 \\).\n3. **Square it:** \\( 2^2 = 4 \\).\n4. **For the Second Part:** \\( \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = 2.25 \\), and then \\( \\lceil 2.25 \\rceil = 3 \\).\n5. **Add Both Parts Together:** \\( 4 + 3 = 7 \\).\n\nBut wait, is this the correct approach? Let me check.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflecting on the Approach**\n\nThinking this through:\n\n- Does it make sense to evaluate each part independently like this?\n- Am I considering the **order of operations** correctly, especially with the ceiling function?\n  \nHmm, I realize that applying the ceiling function after squaring might lead to different results than squaring the ceiling first. This makes me uneasy about the correctness of my initial step-by-step approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring a Different Strategy**\n\nPerhaps I should consider evaluating the entire expression step by step, paying closer attention to how the ceiling function interacts with both squaring and fractions. Let's try that:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\):** Still 1.5.\n2. **First Component \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{3}{2} \\right\\rceil \\):** \n   - \\( \\lceil 1.5 \\rceil = 2 \\).\n   - So, \\( (2)^2 = 4 \\).\n   \n3. **Second Component \\( \\left\\lceil \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2 \\right\\rceil \\):**\n   - Calculate \\( \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{4} = 2.25 \\).\n   - Apply ceiling: \\( \\lceil 2.25 \\rceil = 3 \\).\n\n4. **Sum Both Components:** \n   - \\( 4 + 3 = 7 \\).\n\nThis time, I arrived at the same result, but I feel more confident because I carefully considered each part's evaluation separately.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Does the Result Make Sense?**\n  - Adding the squared ceiling of \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) (which is \\( 4 \\)) and the ceiling of the square of \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) (which is \\( 3 \\)) totals to \\( 7 \\).\n  \n- **Verification:** \n  - \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{3}{2} \\right\\rceil = 2 \\), and \\( 2^2 = 4 \\).\n  - \\( \\left\\lceil \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^2 \\right\\rceil = \\lceil 2.25 \\rceil = 3 \\).\n  - \\( 4 + 3 = 7 \\).\n\nThe consistency across different strategies reassures me that the answer is indeed **7**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming various approaches, reflecting on each step, and verifying the calculations, I've confirmed that:\n\n\\[\nE = 7\n\\]\n\nThis method ensured that I didn't overlook the nuances of the ceiling function and provided a clear, step-by-step path to the correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "In order to evaluate the first half of the expression, we must first find $\\left\\lceil{\\frac32}\\right\\rceil$ and then square that integer. We know that $\\left\\lceil{\\frac32}\\right\\rceil=2$, so $\\left\\lceil{\\frac32}\\right\\rceil^2=4$. For the second half of the expression, we must first evaluate $\\left(\\frac32\\right)^2$, and then find the smallest integer greater than or equal to that value. We know that $\\left(\\frac32\\right)^2=\\frac94$, so $\\left\\lceil{\\left(\\frac32\\right)^2}\\right\\rceil=\\left\\lceil{\\frac94}\\right\\rceil=3$. Thus, the original expression is just equal to $4+3=\\boxed{7}$."
