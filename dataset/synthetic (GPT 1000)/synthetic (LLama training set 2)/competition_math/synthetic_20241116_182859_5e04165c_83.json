    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle the problem step by step, reflecting and brainstorming as we go along. I'll write out my thought process, including exploring different strategies, checking if each step is correct, and adjusting the approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n\\[ e^{2 \\pi i/13} + e^{4 \\pi i/13} + e^{6 \\pi i/13} + \\dots + e^{24 \\pi i/13} \\]\n\nIt looks like a sum of complex exponentials with integer multiples of \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{13} \\). This immediately reminds me of **roots of unity** from complex analysis. \n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure if that's the right path. Maybe there's a more straightforward way to handle these exponentials. Let me brainstorm a bit:\n\n- **Option 1:** Recognize it as a sum of roots of unity.\n- **Option 2:** Use Euler's formula to convert exponentials to trigonometric forms and then sum them.\n- **Option 3:** Simplify the exponents using properties of exponents or periodicity.\n\nI'm leaning towards **Option 1** because it seems familiar, but I'm also considering **Option 2** as it might provide a different perspective.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy: Recognizing Roots of Unity**\n\nLet's start by thinking about roots of unity. The \\( n \\)-th roots of unity are solutions to the equation \\( z^n = 1 \\), and they are given by:\n\n\\[ z_k = e^{2 \\pi i k/n} \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1 \\]\n\nIn this problem, I see exponents that are multiples of \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{13} \\), which suggests we're dealing with the 13th roots of unity. \n\n**Reflection:** Does this make sense? Each term \\( e^{2 \\pi i k/13} \\) where \\( k \\) ranges from 1 to 12 represents the 13th roots of unity (excluding \\( k=0 \\) since \\( e^{0} = 1 \\)). So, the sum is over all 13th roots of unity except 1.\n\nBut wait, I'm only summing up to \\( e^{24 \\pi i/13} \\). Let me check if this aligns with the 13th roots of unity.\n\n### **Checking the Exponents: Periodicity of Exponentials**\n\nI remember that exponentials have periodicity due to the \\( 2\\pi i \\) factor:\n\n\\[ e^{2 \\pi i} = 1 \\]\n\nThis means that \\( e^{2 \\pi i k} = 1 \\) for any integer \\( k \\). So, exponents that differ by multiples of \\( 2\\pi i \\) are equivalent.\n\nLet's simplify the exponents in the sum:\n\n- \\( e^{2 \\pi i/13} \\) is \\( e^{2 \\pi i \\cdot 1/13} \\)\n- \\( e^{4 \\pi i/13} \\) is \\( e^{2 \\pi i \\cdot 2/13} \\)\n- ...\n- \\( e^{24 \\pi i/13} \\) is \\( e^{2 \\pi i \\cdot 12/13} \\)\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, so \\( e^{24 \\pi i/13} \\) is actually the same as \\( e^{2 \\pi i/13} \\) because \\( 24 \\mod 13 = 11 \\). This periodicity suggests that the exponents wrap around after reaching \\( 2\\pi i \\).\n\n### **Revising the Strategy: Summing Up Roots of Unity**\n\nGiven this periodicity, the sum can be seen as adding up the 13th roots of unity. However, since the roots of unity sum to zero, adding all 13th roots of unity (including 1) would give zero.\n\nBut the problem specifies summing from \\( k=1 \\) to \\( k=12 \\) (multiples of \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{13} \\) up to \\( \\frac{24\\pi}{13} \\)), which means we're summing all the roots except \\( z_0 = e^{0} = 1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:** This makes me think that the sum should still be zero because the sum of all roots of unity (including \\( z_0 \\)) is zero. Excluding \\( z_0 = 1 \\) should not change the sum because the roots of unity are symmetrically distributed around the unit circle.\n\n**But let me double-check:** Does excluding one root affect the sum? I recall that the sum of the roots of unity is zero, so excluding one root should result in a sum that is the negative of the excluded root if the roots are symmetrically arranged. Since we're excluding \\( z_0 = 1 \\), the sum should be \\( -1 \\).\n\n### **Checking Assuming \\( e^{2\\pi i/13} + e^{4\\pi i/13} + e^{6\\pi i/13} + ... + e^{24\\pi i/13} = -1 \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s verify this assumption:\n\n1. **Sum of all 13th roots of unity:**\n\n   \\[\n   e^{0} + e^{2\\pi i/13} + e^{4\\pi i/13} + \\dots + e^{24\\pi i/13} = 0 \n   \\]\n\n2. **Excluding \\( e^{0} = 1 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   e^{2\\pi i/13} + e^{4\\pi i/13} + e^{6\\pi i/13} + \\dots + e^{24\\pi i/13} = -1 \n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:** This seems reasonable because the sum of all roots is zero, and excluding \\( z_0 = 1 \\) leaves the sum as \\( -1 \\).\n\n### **Final Thought Process**\n\n- The sum \\( e^{2 \\pi i/13} + e^{4 \\pi i/13} + e^{6 \\pi i/13} + \\dots + e^{24 \\pi i/13} \\) is indeed the sum of all 13th roots of unity except 1.\n- Since the sum of all 13th roots of unity is zero, excluding 1 gives \\( -1 \\).\n- Therefore, the sum evaluates to \\( -1 \\).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\ne^{2 \\pi i/13} + e^{4 \\pi i/13} + e^{6 \\pi i/13} + \\dots + e^{24 \\pi i/13} = -1\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nBy recognizing the sum as involving roots of unity and leveraging the property that the sum of all \\( n \\)-th roots of unity is zero, we concluded that the sum is \\( -1 \\) when excluding \\( z_0 = 1 \\). Throughout the process, we checked for periodicity and symmetry among the roots, ensuring that this approach was correct.\n\nI hope this step-by-step approach, with reflections and checks, provides a clear understanding of how to tackle such problems!",
