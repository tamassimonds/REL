    "working_out": "## Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. The problem is about simplifying a fraction involving powers of \\( x \\), specifically:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^1 \\cdot x^2 \\cdot x^3 \\cdots x^9}{x^2 \\cdot x^4 \\cdot x^6 \\cdots x^{12}}\n\\]\n\nand then evaluating it for \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nImmediately, I recognize that this involves properties of exponents, which I've dealt with before. My initial thought is to see if I can simplify the expression by combining the exponents in the numerator and denominator. This looks similar to problems where you combine terms using exponent rules.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Combine Exponents:** Try simplifying the numerator and denominator by adding the exponents together, since multiplication of like bases adds their exponents.\n\n2. **Factorization:** Perhaps factor out common terms in the numerator and denominator to see if that simplifies things.\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition:** Look for patterns in the exponents to see if there's a simplification that can be applied.\n\n4. **Canceling Common Factors:** After combining exponents, see if any factors can be canceled between the numerator and denominator.\n\nWait, before jumping into combining exponents, let's list out the terms to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nPerhaps it's better to start by writing out the numerator and denominator to see the pattern clearly. Maybe combining exponents right away could lead to mistakes if I don't track the exponents correctly.\n\n## Step 2: Expanding the Numerator and Denominator\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me list out the terms in both the numerator and denominator to get a clearer picture.\n\n- **Numerator:** \\( x^1 \\cdot x^2 \\cdot x^3 \\cdots x^9 \\)\n\nLet's write this out explicitly:\n\n\\[\nx^1 \\times x^2 \\times x^3 \\times x^4 \\times x^5 \\times x^6 \\times x^7 \\times x^8 \\times x^9\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's a series of multiplications. According to the property of exponents, when multiplying like bases, you add the exponents. So, I should be able to simplify this by adding them up.\n\n**Denominator:** \\( x^2 \\cdot x^4 \\cdot x^6 \\cdots x^{12} \\)\n\nLet's write this explicitly:\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\times x^4 \\times x^6 \\times x^8 \\times x^{10} \\times x^{12}\n\\]\n\n**Spotting a Pattern:**\n\nLooking at both lists, I see that:\n\n- The numerator includes all exponents from 1 to 9.\n- The denominator includes even exponents from 2 to 12.\n\nThis gives me a hint that perhaps half the exponents are in the denominator compared to the numerator.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nMaybe I can pair up the exponents in the numerator with those in the denominator to see if there's a cancellation pattern.\n\n## Step 3: Simplifying the Fraction Using Exponent Rules\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n\nCan I apply the exponent rule directly here? The rule states that when dividing like bases, you subtract the exponents. But since the exponents aren't directly aligned (numerator has odd exponents, denominator has even), I need to find a way to match them.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nMaybe I can express the numerator in terms of the exponents present in the denominator. For instance, see if \\( x^2 \\) can cancel with part of \\( x^4 \\), and so on.\n\n**Combining Exponents:**\n\nLet's try this:\n\n- **Numerator Exponents:** \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\)\n- **Denominator Exponents:** \\( 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 \\)\n\nWait, there's a mismatch. The numerator has exponents that don't all have corresponding even exponents in the denominator.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nMaybe pairing isn't the right way. Let's try a different approach: factor out common bases or see if there's a cancellation pattern.\n\n## Step 4: Factoring the Exponents\n\n**New Idea:**\n\nPerhaps I can factor the numerator to see if it shares any common bases with the denominator.\n\nBut looking closely, each term in the numerator and denominator involves different exponents. Maybe factoring isn't the best approach here.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\nLet's think about simplifying the fraction step by step, focusing on common bases.\n\n## Step 5: Simplifying One Exponent at a Time\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nPerhaps simplifying the fraction term by term would work better.\n\nLet's take a look at each term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^1}{x^2}, \\frac{x^2}{x^4}, \\frac{x^3}{x^6}, \\frac{x^4}{x^8}, \\frac{x^5}{x^{10}}, \\frac{x^6}{x^{12}}\n\\]\n\nHmm, wait a minute. Not all terms in the numerator have corresponding terms in the denominator. The first few terms would cancel, but then the numerator has exponents that don't match with the denominator.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach seems helpful for understanding, but it might be more complex than needed. Perhaps there's a better way to simplify the entire fraction at once.\n\n## Step 6: Revisiting the Combining Exponents Strategy\n\n**Reconsidering the Initial Approach:**\n\nMaybe I can still combine exponents, but I need to account for the differences in the exponents between the numerator and denominator.\n\n**Applying Exponent Rules:**\n\nWhen dividing like bases, subtract the exponents:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}\n\\]\n\n**Numerator Exponent Sum:**\n\nLet's find the sum of the exponents in the numerator:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45\n\\]\n\n**Denominator Exponent Sum:**\n\nLet's find the sum of the exponents in the denominator:\n\n\\[\n2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 = 42\n\\]\n\nWait, the exponents don't directly align. I can't simply subtract the sums because the bases aren't directly canceling like in simpler problems.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI realize now that my initial idea of combining exponents by adding their sums doesn't apply directly here because the exponents in the numerator and denominator don't match one-for-one.\n\n## Step 7: Seeking a Different Strategy\n\n**Thinking Differently:**\n\nPerhaps a different approach is needed. Let me consider another angle.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nMaybe I can simplify the fraction by canceling common bases step by step, but since the exponents don't align perfectly, that might not be straightforward.\n\n**Another Idea:**\n\nPerhaps I can use properties of exponents to simplify individual terms.\n\n**Simplifying Individual Terms:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^1 \\cdot x^2 \\cdots x^9}{x^2 \\cdot x^4 \\cdots x^{12}} = \\frac{x^{1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9}}{x^{2+4+6+8+10+12}} = \\frac{x^{45}}{x^{42}} = x^{45-42} = x^3\n\\]\n\nOh wait, that doesn't seem right. I added the exponents in a way that doesn't account for overlapping bases properly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach led to \\( x^3 \\), but I'm not confident because the exponents in the numerator and denominator don't align perfectly. I think I need to reconsider how to accurately combine or simplify the exponents.\n\n## Step 8: Final Strategy - Factor and Simplify Correctly\n\n**Final Idea:**\n\nPerhaps I can simplify the fraction by canceling exponents where possible, but since the exponents don't align perfectly, I need to be careful.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\nLet's think about simplifying by recognizing that each term in the numerator and denominator follows a certain pattern.\n\n**Simplifying by Recognizing Patterns:**\n\nThe numerator includes exponents from 1 to 9, while the denominator includes even exponents from 2 to 12. This suggests that the denominator might represent squares of certain terms in the numerator.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, there's no straightforward squaring relationship here.\n\n**Wait, Let's Reconsider:**\n\nMaybe factoring doesn't apply here because the exponents are not quadratic or cubic.\n\n**But Maybe:**\n\nPerhaps the fraction simplifies to a power of \\( x \\) by canceling out certain exponents.\n\n**Simplifying by Cancellation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^m}{x^n} = x^{m-n}\n\\]\n\nbut since there's no direct cancellation pattern here, maybe another insight is needed.\n\n**Other Possible Insights:**\n\nPerhaps the fraction simplifies to \\( x^{\\text{some exponent}} \\), but determining that exponent requires careful tracking of which terms cancel.\n\n**But Perhaps:**\n\nAfter careful consideration, I realize that directly combining exponents or attempting to factor doesn't lead to a straightforward simplification because the bases don't cancel directly.\n\n**Instead:**\n\nIt seems that simplifying the fraction doesn't lead to an elegant exponent expression because of the mismatch in exponents.\n\n**Final Insight:**\n\nGiven the complexity and potential pitfalls in oversimplifying, perhaps the best approach is to evaluate the original expression for \\( x = 5 \\) to see the numerical result directly.\n\n## Step 9: Evaluating the Expression for \\( x = 5 \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nInstead of trying to simplify the fraction algebraically, let me compute it numerically for \\( x = 5 \\) to find the exact value.\n\n**Calculating the Numerator:**\n\n\\[\n5^1 \\times 5^2 \\times 5^3 \\times 5^4 \\times 5^5 \\times 5^6 \\times 5^7 \\times 5^8 \\times 5^9\n\\]\n\nThis is a series of multiplications:\n\n\\[\n5^1 = 5\\\\\n5^2 = 25\\\\\n5^3 = 125\\\\\n5^4 = 625\\\\\n5^5 = 3125\\\\\n5^6 = 15625\\\\\n5^7 = 78125\\\\\n5^8 = 390625\\\\\n5^9 = 1953125\n\\]\n\nMultiplying them all together:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 25 \\times 125 \\times 625 \\times 3125 \\times 15625 \\times 78125 \\times 390625 \\times 1953125 = \\text{a very large number}\n\\]\n\nWait, calculating this manually is error-prone and time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way to handle it.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nPerhaps I can express the numerator as a single power of \\( 5 \\):\n\n\\[\n5^1 \\times 5^2 \\times 5^3 \\times 5^4 \\times 5^5 \\times 5^6 \\times 5^7 \\times 5^8 \\times 5^9 = 5^{1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9}\n\\]\n\nLet's add the exponents:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45\n\\]\n\nSo, the numerator simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n5^{45}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the Denominator:**\n\n\\[\n5^2 \\times 5^4 \\times 5^6 \\times 5^8 \\times 5^{10} \\times 5^{12}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, express the denominator as a single power of \\( 5 \\):\n\n\\[\n2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 = 42\n\\]\n\nSo, the denominator simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n5^{42}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5^{45}}{5^{42}} = 5^{45-42} = 5^3\n\\]\n\nHmm, this matches the earlier conclusion, but I'm not entirely confident because the step-by-step cancellation was complex.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nAfter considering different strategies and checking the work, I conclude that the fraction simplifies to \\( 5^3 \\). However, I realize that directly evaluating the numerator and denominator could lead to mistakes, so verifying through exponent rules ensures accuracy.\n\n## Step 10: Final Answer\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n5^3 = 125\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe value of the given expression when \\( x = 5 \\) is **125**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nInitially, attempting to simplify the fraction algebraically by combining exponents directly led to confusion due to the mismatch in exponents between the numerator and denominator. By rethinking the approach and recognizing that expressing both parts as single powers of \\( 5 \\) streamlined the simplification process, I was able to arrive at the correct solution.\n\nThis step-by-step reflection and revisiting of strategies ensured that the final answer was accurate, even when the initial approach didn't provide a straightforward path.",
