I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst thoughts: \n- The problem asks me to compute \\(\\frac{6! + 7!}{5!}\\).\n- I see factorials involved, which reminds me of permutations and combinations. Factorials signify products of integers, and they grow pretty quickly.\n- Looking at the expression, both the numerator and denominator involve factorials. Maybe I can simplify by canceling out some terms.\n\nInitial brainstorming: \n- **Option 1:** Expand each factorial term completely and then simplify.\n- **Option 2:** Factor out common terms in the numerator before dividing by the denominator.\n- **Option 3:** Use properties of factorials to simplify the expression without expanding everything.\n\nI'm thinking Option 2 might be the most efficient because it looks like there might be a common factor I can pull out. But let's explore each to see what's best.\n\n## **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n### **Strategy 1: Expanding Factorials Completely**\n\nTry expanding \\(6!\\) and \\(7!\\) fully to see if that helps.\n\n\\[\n6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720\n\\]\n\\[\n7! = 7 \\times 6! = 7 \\times 720 = 5040\n\\]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n\\[\n6! + 7! = 720 + 5040 = 5760\n\\]\n\nNow, divide by \\(5!\\):\n\n\\[\n5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{5760}{120} = 48\n\\]\n\nQuick check: \n- \\(48 \\times 120 = 5760\\), so that multiplication checks out. But expanding seems a bit cumbersome for larger numbers.\n\n### **Strategy 2: Factoring Out Common Terms**\n\nLet's see if I can simplify the numerator before dividing by the denominator.\n\n\\[\n6! + 7! = 6! + 7 \\times 6! = 6!(1 + 7) = 6! \\times 8\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6! \\times 8}{5!}\n\\]\n\nNow, divide:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6! \\times 8}{5!} = 6! \\div 5! \\times 8 = 6 \\times 8 = 48\n\\]\n\nReflection: \n- This seems much faster and cleaner. By factoring out \\(6!\\), I reduced the problem significantly.\n\n### **Strategy 3: Canceling Factorials**\n\nAnother way might be to directly cancel out \\(5!\\) from both numerator and denominator after factoring.\n\nWait, let me think about this.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6! + 7!}{5!} = \\frac{6!}{5!} + \\frac{7!}{5!}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 6 + \\frac{7 \\times 6!}{5!} = 6 + 7 \\times 6 = 6 + 42 = 48\n\\]\n\nQuick check: \n- Both methods lead to the same answer, \\(48\\). Canceling method also works well here.\n\n## **Step 3: Verifying the Solutions**\n\nBefore concluding, let\u2019s ensure both strategies are correct.\n\n### **Verification of Strategy 2: Factoring Out Common Terms**\n\n\\[\n6! + 7! = 6! \\times 8 \\implies \\frac{6! \\times 8}{5!} = 6 \\times 8 = 48\n\\]\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\n- \\(6! \\times 8\\) divided by \\(5!\\) simplifies to multiplying \\(6\\) (since \\(6! / 5! = 6\\)) by \\(8\\), which is \\(48\\).\n- This aligns with our earlier findings.\n\n### **Verification of Strategy 3: Canceling Factorials**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6! + 7!}{5!} = \\frac{6!}{5!} + \\frac{7!}{5!} = 6 + 42 = 48\n\\]\n\nDoes this check out?\n\n- Adding \\(6\\) and \\(42\\) gives \\(48\\), consistent with our previous results.\n\n## **Step 4: Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nInitially, I considered expanding the factorials completely, but that felt time-consuming, especially with larger numbers. Factoring out the common term \\(6!\\) proved to be an efficient strategy, simplifying the expression significantly.\n\nBoth alternative strategies\u2014factoring and canceling factorials\u2014led to the same correct solution: \\(48\\).\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{48}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThroughout this process, by brainstorming and exploring different strategies, I realized that simplifying the expression before performing the division was the most efficient approach. Regular checks ensured that each step was correct, leading to a confident and accurate final answer.",
