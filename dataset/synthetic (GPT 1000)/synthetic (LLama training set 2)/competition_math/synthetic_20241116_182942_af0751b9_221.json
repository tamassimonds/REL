I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work thoroughly to ensure I'm on the right track. If something doesn't seem right, I'll reconsider my approach. Let's get started!\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \n\n\\[\n\\frac{x-4}{9} = \\frac{4}{x-9}\n\\]\n\nmy immediate reaction is to recognize that it's a fractional equation involving \\(x\\) in both the numerator and denominator. I've dealt with similar problems before, where cross-multiplying was an effective strategy. But I also recall that sometimes simplifying fractions or finding a common denominator can help. Maybe there are other methods like clearing the fractions entirely or substituting variables to make it easier.\n\nI think it's essential to **brainstorm** and consider these options before committing to one. Let's list potential strategies:\n\n1. **Cross-Multiply:** This is a straightforward method for equations set as fractions equal to each other.\n2. **Find a Common Denominator:** Combine the fractions to simplify the equation.\n3. **Isolate \\(x\\):** Attempt to get \\(x\\) by moving terms around, maybe by adding or subtracting fractions.\n4. **Substitution:** If the equation were more complex, substituting a variable might simplify it.\n\nGiven that it's a simple fractional equation, **cross-multiplying** seems like the most direct approach. But I want to be sure, so let's explore it step by step.\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting Cross-Multiplication**\n\n**Thought Process:** Cross-multiplying is often effective for solving fractional equations because it eliminates the denominators. Let's try that and see if it leads us to the solution.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nCross-multiply:\n\n\\[\n(x - 4) \\cdot (x - 9) = 4 \\cdot 9\n\\]\n\nExpand both sides:\n\n\\[\n(x - 4)(x - 9) = 4 \\cdot 9 \\implies x^2 - 9x - 4x + 36 = 36\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 13x + 36 = 36\n\\]\n\nWait... something seems off. Let me double-check.\n\n**Reflection:** Oh, I see now. I should have moved all terms to one side before setting it equal to zero. Let me correct that.\n\n**Correction:**\n\nSubtract 36 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 13x + 36 - 36 = 0 \\implies x^2 - 13x = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Now the equation looks cleaner. Let's proceed.\n\n### **Step 2: Factoring the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:** I have a quadratic equation now. Factoring seems like a good way to find the values of \\(x\\). Alternatively, I could use the quadratic formula, but let's try factoring first to see if it works.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFactor the equation:\n\n\\[\nx(x - 13) = 0\n\\]\n\nSet each factor to zero:\n\n\\[\nx = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 13 = 0 \\implies x = 13\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, we have two solutions: \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 13\\). But wait, the problem asks for the **only positive real number** \\(x\\). That means \\(x = 13\\) is our solution. \\(x = 0\\) isn't positive, so we discard it.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:** It's crucial to verify that our solution satisfies the original equation. Let\u2019s plug \\(x = 13\\) back into the original equation to ensure it's correct.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x - 4}{9} = \\frac{4}{x - 9}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 13\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13 - 4}{9} = \\frac{4}{13 - 9}\n\\]\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{9} = \\frac{4}{4} \\implies 1 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Both sides are equal, so \\(x = 13\\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:** Even though cross-multiplying worked well here, it's always good to consider other methods to ensure robustness, especially if I had doubts or if the problem was more complex.\n\nLet's briefly think about using a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x - 4}{9} = \\frac{4}{x - 9}\n\\]\n\nFind a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n9(x - 9) = 4 \\cdot 9\n\\]\n\nBut wait, this seems more complicated than cross-multiplying. Perhaps for more complex equations, finding a common denominator might help, but here it feels like extra work.\n\nAnother method could be to clear fractions entirely by multiplying both sides by \\(9(x - 9)\\), but again, that seems overkill for this simple equation.\n\n**Reflection:** Cross-multiplying was the most straightforward and effective approach for this problem. Alternative methods would likely complicate things unnecessarily.\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring Everything Makes Sense**\n\n**Thought Process:** Before wrapping up, let's ensure that every step aligns and that the solution is correctly derived.\n\n- **Cross-Multiplication:** Correctly applied, leading to a simplified quadratic equation.\n- **Factoring:** Successfully factored the quadratic to find possible solutions.\n- **Considering Positivity:** Acknowledged only the positive solution as required.\n- **Verification:** Substituted back into the original equation to confirm correctness.\n\n**Check:** All steps are consistent, and the solution satisfies the original equation.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and meticulously checking each step, the only positive real number \\(x\\) that satisfies the equation \n\n\\[\n\\frac{x - 4}{9} = \\frac{4}{x - 9}\n\\]\n\nis \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]\n\nThroughout this process, brainstorming various approaches, reflecting on each step, and verifying the solution were crucial in ensuring the correctness of the answer.",

  "ground_truth": "The first approach that comes to mind is probably also the best one.  So we cross-multiply to obtain $(x-4)(x-9) = 36$.  Multiplying out the left-hand side and cancelling the 36 yields $x^2-13x = 0$, or $x(x-13)=0$.  This equation has two solutions, $x=0$ and 13.  Since we are looking for positive answers, we take $x=\\boxed{13}$."
