    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's approach this problem just like how I would tackle it in real life, with brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking for correctness along the way.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The problem is asking how many natural-number factors of \\( n \\) are multiples of 150, where \\( n = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^{14} \\cdot 5^{8} \\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving prime factorization and finding specific subsets of factors. I think I'll need to use properties of exponents and perhaps the concept of divisibility.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Prime Factorization:** Factor 150 and see how its primes fit into the factors of \\( n \\).\n  2. **Counting Divisors:** Use the formula for counting divisors to find those that are multiples of 150.\n  3. **Subset of Multiples:** Identify all factors that are multiples of 150 and count them.\n\n- **But Wait:** Does counting all divisors directly work? I recall that only a subset of divisors will be multiples of 150. So maybe I need to focus on factors that include specific primes with certain exponents.\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Approaches**\n\n- **Approach 1:** Factor 150 and see how its primes fit into \\( n \\).\n- **Approach 2:** Count all divisors of \\( n \\) and then determine which are multiples of 150.\n- **Approach 3:** Directly find the prime factors of 150 and see how many combinations with exponents fit into \\( n \\).\n\nAt first glance, **Approach 1** seems straightforward: factor 150 and see how its primes align with those in \\( n \\). But let's explore a bit to confirm.\n\n### **Step 1: Factoring 150**\n\nLet me start by factoring 150 to understand its prime components.\n\n\\[\n150 = 2 \\times 75\n\\]\n\\[\n75 = 3 \\times 25\n\\]\n\\[\n25 = 5 \\times 5\n\\]\n\nSo, **150 = \\( 2^{1} \\times 3^{1} \\times 5^{2} \\)**.\n\n- **Reflection:** Hmm, 150 has a 2, a 3, and two 5s. I see that each prime in 150 must be present in the factors of \\( n \\) with at least these exponents for a factor to be a multiple of 150.\n\n### **Checkpoint: Is That Correct?**\n\n- Does this make sense? Yes, because for a factor to be a multiple of 150, it must divide 150, meaning it needs at least one 2, one 3, and two 5s.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing Exponents in \\( n \\)**\n\nNow, let's look at the exponents in \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^{14} \\cdot 5^{8}\n\\]\n\nI see that \\( n \\) has plenty of each prime factor compared to what's needed for 150.\n\n- **Thought Process:** Wait a minute! Since \\( n \\) has more than enough primes, the possible factors of \\( n \\) that are multiples of 150 are those where:\n  - The exponent of 2 is at least 1 (up to 10)\n  - The exponent of 3 is at least 1 (up to 14)\n  - The exponent of 5 is at least 2 (up to 8)\n\nThis means the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 in such factors can range from their minimum required by 150 to their maximum in \\( n \\).\n\n### **Check: Does This Strategy Make Sense?**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Yes, because we're ensuring that any factor we count has at least the necessary primes to be a multiple of 150.\n\n### **Step 3: Counting Valid Exponents**\n\nLet's count the possible values for each exponent:\n\n1. **Exponent of 2:** Must be between 1 and 10.\n   - Possible values: 1, 2, \u2026, 10 \u2192 **10 options**\n   \n2. **Exponent of 3:** Must be between 1 and 14.\n   - Possible values: 1, 2, \u2026, 14 \u2192 **14 options**\n   \n3. **Exponent of 5:** Must be between 2 and 8.\n   - Possible values: 2, 3, \u2026, 8 \u2192 **7 options**\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, are there any overlaps or restrictions I\u2019m missing? Nope, each prime's exponents are independent as long as they meet the minimum requirements.\n\n### **Check: Is My Counting Correct?**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Yes, because each exponent range is straightforward and doesn't interfere with the others.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Total Number of Valid Factors**\n\nNow, let's multiply the number of options for each prime's exponent:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total factors} = 10 \\times 14 \\times 7 = 980\n\\]\n\n- **Thought Process:** Oh! I remember that each combination of exponents corresponds to a unique factor of \\( n \\). So, multiplying the number of choices for each prime gives the total number of factors that are multiples of 150.\n\n### **Check: Does This Result Make Sense?**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Hmm, 980 seems like a reasonable number compared to the total factors of \\( n \\). Let me think\u2026 \\( n \\) itself has a lot of factors, and 980 is a fraction of that, which aligns with having specific prime requirements.\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\nLet me verify if this approach covers all possibles without missing anything:\n\n- **Does it include all combinations?** Yes, because we're considering all exponents that meet or exceed those in 150.\n  \n- **Is there overcounting or undercounting?** No, each factor corresponds uniquely to a combination of exponents.\n\n- **Does it align with examples or known properties?** Yes, factors that are multiples of a base number must at least include its prime factors with the required exponents.\n\n### **Check: Final Reflection**\n\n- **Final Check:** Does this approach feel complete? Yes, I\u2019ve considered all necessary exponents and calculated their combinations correctly.\n\n- **Does the answer align with expectations?** The answer seems plausible given the problem's constraints.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**The total number of natural-number factors of \\( n \\) that are multiples of 150 is **\\(\\boxed{980}\\)**.**\n\n- **Summary:** By analyzing the prime factorization of 150 and comparing it with the exponents in \\( n \\), we determined the range of exponents for each prime that would make a factor of \\( n \\) a multiple of 150. Multiplying these options together yielded the total number of such factors.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Did everything go as planned?** Mostly, I started by factoring 150, which laid the groundwork for understanding the problem. There were no major dead ends, and the approach worked smoothly.\n  \n- **Is there anything I would change?** Perhaps, checking the total number of factors of \\( n \\) beforehand could provide a better context for the 980, but overall, the approach was straightforward.\n\n- **What did I learn?** Prime factorization plays a crucial role in understanding the divisibility properties of numbers, and carefully counting exponent ranges ensures accurate results.\n\nThat\u2019s how I\u2019d think through this problem, step by step, checking and reflecting along the way to ensure the approach and answer are correct.",
