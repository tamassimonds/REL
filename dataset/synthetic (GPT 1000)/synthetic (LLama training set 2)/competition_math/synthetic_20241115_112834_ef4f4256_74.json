  "problem": "A store carries chocolate, vanilla, peppermint, and lemon candies. One day, the store clerk notices that he has fifteen candies total. Furthermore, the number of peppermint and lemon candies together is twice the number of chocolate and vanilla candies together, and there are eight more peppermint candies than lemon candies. How many lemon candies are there?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies to tackle it, reflecting as I go, and checking my work frequently like I would if I were solving it manually.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, here\u2019s the problem:\n\n- **Total Candies:** 15 (chocolate, vanilla, peppermint, lemon)\n- **Condition 1:** Peppermint + Lemon = 2 \u00d7 (Chocolate + Vanilla)\n- **Condition 2:** Peppermint = Lemon + 8\n\nWhen I first see this, I think it's a systems of equations problem. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. It reminds me of problems where you set up equations based on given relationships, but I need to brainstorm a bit to make sure.\n\nPossible strategies:\n\n1. **Set Up Equations:** Assign variables to each type of candy and translate the conditions into equations.\n2. **Use Substitution:** Substitute one equation into another to solve for the variables.\n3. **Check Total After Each Step:** Make sure the total always adds up to 15 to catch any mistakes early.\n\nLet me try the **Set Up Equations** method first because it seems straightforward. If it gets too complicated, I\u2019ll rethink and maybe try another approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Assign Variables**\n\nI'll assign a variable to each type of candy to make it easier to work with:\n\n- Let \\( C \\) = Number of Chocolate candies\n- Let \\( V \\) = Number of Vanilla candies\n- Let \\( P \\) = Number of Peppermint candies\n- Let \\( L \\) = Number of Lemon candies\n\nHmm, reflecting on this, it seems like a good start because it\u2019ll help me translate the conditions into mathematical statements.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Translate Conditions into Equations**\n\nNow, let's turn the conditions into equations using the variables:\n\n1. **Total Candies:**  \n   \\( C + V + P + L = 15 \\)  \n   This is straightforward; it\u2019s just the total number of candies.\n\n2. **Peppermint + Lemon = 2 \u00d7 (Chocolate + Vanilla):**  \n   \\( P + L = 2 \\times (C + V) \\)  \n   Thinking about it, this ties the peppermint and lemon candies directly to chocolate and vanilla.\n\n3. **Peppermint = Lemon + 8:**  \n   \\( P = L + 8 \\)  \n   This gives a direct relationship between peppermint and lemon candies.\n\nReflecting here, I have three equations and four variables, which suggests that there's a relationship between them that can reduce the number of variables. It gives me hope that I can solve this system.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Substitute the Known Relationship**\n\nI know that \\( P = L + 8 \\). Let\u2019s substitute this into the second equation to reduce the number of variables.\n\n**Substituting into Equation 2:**  \n\\[ \n(L + 8) + L = 2 \\times (C + V) \n\\]  \nSimplifying:  \n\\[ \n2L + 8 = 2C + 2V \n\\]  \nDividing both sides by 2 to simplify:  \n\\[ \nL + 4 = C + V \n\\]  \nThis is a nice simplification. Now I have:\n\n- \\( L + 4 = C + V \\)\n- \\( C + V + P + L = 15 \\)\n\nReflecting, at this point, it\u2019s looking cleaner. I can substitute \\( P = L + 8 \\) into the total equation to eliminate one more variable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Substitute \\( P = L + 8 \\) into Total Equation**\n\nLet\u2019s substitute \\( P = L + 8 \\) into the total candies equation:\n\n\\[ \nC + V + (L + 8) + L = 15 \n\\]  \nSimplifying:  \n\\[ \nC + V + 2L + 8 = 15 \n\\]  \nSubtracting 8 from both sides:  \n\\[ \nC + V + 2L = 7 \n\\]  \nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. \\( L + 4 = C + V \\)\n2. \\( C + V + 2L = 7 \\)\n\nHmm, reflecting on this, it seems like I can solve these two equations simultaneously. Let\u2019s see if I can eliminate one variable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2**\n\nFrom Equation 1:  \n\\[ \nC + V = L + 4 \n\\]  \nLet\u2019s substitute this into Equation 2:  \n\\[ \n(L + 4) + 2L = 7 \n\\]  \nSimplifying:  \n\\[ \n3L + 4 = 7 \n\\]  \nWait a minute, let me double-check...  \n\\[ \n3L = 7 - 4 \n\\]  \n\\[ \n3L = 3 \n\\]  \n\\[ \nL = 1 \n\\]  \nAlright, so according to this, there are **1 lemon candy**.\n\nReflecting on this, it seems too straightforward. Let me check if this makes sense with the other conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verify the Solution**\n\nIf \\( L = 1 \\), then using \\( P = L + 8 \\):  \n\\[ \nP = 1 + 8 = 9 \n\\]  \n\nUsing \\( L + 4 = C + V \\):  \n\\[ \n1 + 4 = C + V \\Rightarrow 5 = C + V \n\\]  \n\nNow, let\u2019s check the total:  \n\\[ \nC + V + P + L = 5 + 9 + 1 = 15 \n\\]  \nThis matches the total candies, so the numbers add up correctly.\n\nAlso, the condition \\( P + L = 2 \u00d7 (C + V) \\):  \n\\[ \n9 + 1 = 10 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 \n\\]  \nSo this condition is satisfied as well.\n\nEverything checks out. The solution makes sense according to all the given conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\nInitially, I wasn\u2019t sure how to start, but brainstorming led me to set up a system of equations based on the conditions provided. By carefully substituting and simplifying, I was able to find that there is **1 lemon candy** in the store.\n\nThroughout the process, I continuously checked if each step was leading me closer to a logical solution. When the numbers didn\u2019t seem right, I re-evaluated my substitutions and calculations, which helped catch and correct any potential mistakes early on.\n\nThis step-by-step approach not only provided the correct answer but also ensured that all conditions were met, validating the solution's correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThere is **1 lemon candy** in the store.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $a$ denote the number of chocolate candies, $b$ the number of vanilla, $c$ the number of peppermint, and $d$ the number of lemon. We can represent the information given in the problem with the following system of linear equations:\n\\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &= 15 \\\\\n2(a+b) &= c+d \\\\\nc-8 &= d\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $c+d$ in terms of $a+b$ into the first equation gives $3a + 3b = 15$, or $a + b = 5$. This means that $c + d = 10$. The third equation can also be expressed as $c - d = 8$. Adding these two equations gives $2c = 18$, so $c = 9$. Because $d = c - 8$, $d = \\boxed{1}$."
