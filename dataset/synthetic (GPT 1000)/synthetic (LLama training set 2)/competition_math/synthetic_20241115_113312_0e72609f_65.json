Let's tackle this problem the way I would naturally approach it if I were solving it myself, thinking out loud, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work progressively.\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n**\"The product of two positive integers minus their sum is 39. The integers are relatively prime, and each is less than 20. What is the sum of the two integers?\"**\n\n- **First Impressions:** This reminds me of problems involving relationships between the sum and product of integers, like factoring or using algebraic identities. I\u2019ve seen similar problems before, but the \"relatively prime\" condition and the upper limit of 20 add unique twists.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n    1. **Algebraic Approach:** Set up equations based on the given conditions.\n    2. **Trial and Error:** Manually check pairs of integers to see which satisfy the conditions.\n    3. **Use of Properties of Relatively Prime Numbers:** Maybe leverage that to narrow down possible pairs.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** I think starting with an algebraic approach might be clean, but given the constraints (both integers less than 20), perhaps a combination of algebra and trial-and-error could work effectively. This way, I can verify my approach as I go.\n\n- **Reflection:** Is it better to start with equations or test pairs? Maybe starting with equations will give a clearer path, but I should be ready to pivot if it gets messy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nGiven that the product minus the sum equals 39, I can represent this mathematically.\n\n- Let the two integers be \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n- According to the problem: \n  \\[\n  xy - (x + y) = 39\n  \\]\n  \n- **Rearranging the Equation:**\n  \\[\n  xy - x - y = 39\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  xy - x - y - 39 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\nDoes this look correct? It seems like a standard way to set up such problems. But to make it more familiar, I could think about factoring or recognizing patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting to Factor the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLooking at the rearranged equation:\n\\[\nxy - x - y - 39 = 0\n\\]\n  \n- Maybe I can factor it. Let's try to reformat it:\n  \\[\n  xy - x - y = 39\n  \\]\n  \n- **Adding 1 to Both Sides:**\n  \\[\n  xy - x - y + 1 = 40\n  \\]\n  \n- **Factoring the Left Side:**\n  \\[\n  (x - 1)(y - 1) = 40\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\nWait, that looks promising! This resembles the difference of squares or product-sum factoring problems I've done before. But let me double-check if adding 1 was a correct step.\n\n- **Check:** \n  Adding 1 on the left side balances the equation because \\((x - 1)(y - 1)\\) expands to \\(xy - x - y + 1\\). So, adding 1 to both sides makes sense.\n\n- **Realization:** \nThis transformation suggests that the product of \\((x - 1)\\) and \\((y - 1)\\) equals 40. This could lead us to potential pairs \\((x, y)\\) that satisfy the equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying All Possible Integer Pairs**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need to find all pairs of integers \\((x, y)\\) such that:\n\\[\n(x - 1)(y - 1) = 40\n\\]\n  \n- **Possible Factor Pairs of 40:**\n  - \\(1 \\times 40\\)\n  - \\(2 \\times 20\\)\n  - \\(4 \\times 10\\)\n  - \\(5 \\times 8\\)\n  - Negative pairs (but since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive, we'll ignore those)\n\n- **Calculating Corresponding \\((x, y)\\) Pairs:**\n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  (x - 1, y - 1) &= (1, 40) & \\Rightarrow &(x, y) = (2, 41) \\quad \\text{(Exceeds 20)} \\\\\n  (2, 20) &\\Rightarrow &(x, y) = (3, 21) \\quad \\text{(Exceeds 20)} \\\\\n  (4, 10) &\\Rightarrow &(x, y) = (5, 11) \\\\\n  (5, 8) &\\Rightarrow &(x, y) = (6, 9) \\\\\n  (8, 5) &\\Rightarrow &(x, y) = (9, 6) \\\\\n  (10, 4) &\\Rightarrow &(x, y) = (11, 5) \\\\\n  (20, 2) &\\Rightarrow &(x, y) = (21, 3) \\quad \\text{(Exceeds 20)} \\\\\n  (40, 1) &\\Rightarrow &(x, y) = (41, 2) \\quad \\text{(Exceeds 20)} \\\\\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\nLet me quickly check which of these pairs are less than 20 and also relatively prime:\n\n- **Valid Pairs Under 20:**\n  - \\( (5, 11) \\)\n  - \\( (6, 9) \\)\n  - \\( (9, 6) \\)\n  - \\( (11, 5) \\)\n\n- **Relatively Prime Check:**\n  - \\(5\\) and \\(11\\): gcd(5, 11) = 1\n  - \\(6\\) and \\(9\\): gcd(6, 9) = 3 (Not relatively prime)\n  - \\(9\\) and \\(6\\): gcd(9, 6) = 3 (Not relatively prime)\n  - \\(11\\) and \\(5\\): gcd(11, 5) = 1\n\n- **Conclusion:** \nOnly \\( (5, 11) \\) and \\( (11, 5) \\) are relatively prime and within the range.\n\n- **Realization:**\nWait, do these pairs satisfy the original equation? Let me verify.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Valid Pairs**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI need to ensure that the pairs \\( (5, 11) \\) and \\( (11, 5) \\) satisfy the original condition:\n\\[\nxy - (x + y) = 39\n\\]\n  \n- **Checking \\( (5, 11) \\):**\n  \\[\n  5 \\times 11 - (5 + 11) = 55 - 16 = 39 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Checking \\( (11, 5) \\):**\n  \\[\n  11 \\times 5 - (11 + 5) = 55 - 16 = 39 \\quad \\text{(Correct)}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\nBoth pairs satisfy the condition. This confirms that our factoring approach was correct.\n\n- **Random Insight:**\nIt's interesting how factoring transformed the problem into a simple product-sum relationship, revealing the solution efficiently.\n\n- **Check:**\nDoes it make sense that there are two pairs? Given that multiplication is commutative, \\( (5, 11) \\) and \\( (11, 5) \\) are essentially the same in terms of the equation's requirement.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe problem asks for the **sum** of the two integers. From our valid pairs, let's calculate the sum:\n\n- **Sum of \\(5\\) and \\(11\\):**\n  \\[\n  5 + 11 = 16\n  \\]\n  \n- **Sum of \\(11\\) and \\(5\\):**\n  \\[\n  11 + 5 = 16\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\nBoth pairs yield the same sum. This consistency reassures me that the solution is correct.\n\n- **Check:**\nDoes the sum fit all the given conditions (relatively prime, each less than 20)? Yes, \\(5\\) and \\(11\\) are both less than 20 and relatively prime.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:** Starting with setting up an equation was effective. Factoring it into \\((x - 1)(y - 1) = 40\\) simplified the problem significantly.\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** The trial-and-error method could have worked, but it might have been less efficient, especially with the relatively prime constraint.\n\n- **Learning:** Always consider transforming equations to recognizable forms; it can lead to quicker solutions.\n\n- **Verification is Key:** Regularly checking each step ensures accuracy and builds confidence in the solution.\n\n- **Final Check:** The sum of the integers is **16**, which satisfies all the problem's conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, starting with an algebraic approach, factoring the equation, and verifying each step, we've determined that the sum of the two integers is **16**. Reflecting throughout the process helped catch potential missteps and ensured the solution's correctness.",

So, we add $1$ to both sides to \"complete the rectangle\":\n\n\\[ab - a - b + 1 = 39 + 1 \\implies (a - 1)(b - 1) = 40.\\]We can narrow down the possibilities by considering all the positive factor pairs of $40$.
