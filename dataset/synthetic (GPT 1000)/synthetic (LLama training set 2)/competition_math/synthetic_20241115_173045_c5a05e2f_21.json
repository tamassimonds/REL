    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming and trying different strategies, reflecting and checking my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\nWhen I first see this problem, I think: **\"This looks like a geometry problem involving a parallelogram with a given angle and side lengths. Parallelograms have some specific properties that might help here.\"**\n\nInitially, I feel a bit unsure because I remember there are multiple ways to find the area of a parallelogram, but I can't recall which method would be the most straightforward for this particular case.\n\nPossible strategies that come to mind:\n\n1. **Use the formula for the area involving the sine of the angle between two sides:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\text{base} \\times \\text{height versus base} = a \\times b \\times \\sin(\\theta)\n   \\]\n   But I realize, wait, I might need the height, and that could complicate things.\n\n2. **Decompose the parallelogram into triangles and use their areas:**\n   Maybe I can visualize splitting the parallelogram along one of its diagonals.\n\n3. **Use vector methods if I'm comfortable with them:**\n   This could involve vectors but feels a bit advanced for now.\n\n4. **Apply the law of cosines to find missing angles or side lengths:**\n   Could help if I need more information about the sides.\n\nThinking about these options, I recall that the first method\u2014using the side lengths and the sine of the given angle\u2014seems like the most direct approach since we have a specific angle and the lengths of two consecutive sides.\n\n**But then I wonder: Is it really that straightforward? Maybe I should double-check if I need to account for anything else.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Verifying the Approach**\n\nLet\u2019s explore the first method in detail:\n\n- **Given:** One angle is 120 degrees, and the sides are 8 inches and 15 inches.\n- **Formula:** Area = \\( a \\times b \\times \\sin(\\theta) \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the side lengths, and \\( \\theta \\) is the included angle.\n\n**Wait a minute...** The angle given is 120 degrees, which is obtuse. For the sine function, I know that:\n\\[\n\\sin(120^\\circ) = \\sin(180^\\circ - 60^\\circ) = \\sin(60^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\nSo, that part seems correct.\n\n**Feeling more confident now,** let's proceed with this method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Formula**\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 8 \\times 15 \\times \\sin(120^\\circ)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 120 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Quick calculation:**\n\n\\[\n= 60\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \nDoes this make sense? The area is expressed in terms of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\), which feels right given the sine of 120 degrees involves \\(\\sqrt{3}\\). \n\n**But let me double-check:** Is using \\(\\sin(120^\\circ)\\) appropriate here? Since 120 degrees is the angle between the two sides of lengths 8 and 15 inches, it seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Checking the Work**\n\n**Does the answer seem reasonable?**\n- **Units:** The area is in square inches, so that's correct.\n- **Magnitude:** \\(60\\sqrt{3}\\) is approximately \\(103.92\\), which seems plausible for a parallelogram with sides of 8 and 15 inches and an angle of 120 degrees.\n\n**Check:**\n\\[\n60\\sqrt{3} \\approx 60 \\times 1.732 = 103.92\n\\]\n**Wait, is this number too big?** Let me think\u2014an angle of 120 degrees, with side lengths 8 and 15, is likely to produce a significant area, especially with \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) involved.\n\n**Hmm, checking again,** the approach seems correct, and the calculation aligns with the properties of the sine function.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Alternative Approaches**\n\nEven though the first method worked, **let's explore an alternative strategy** to ensure the answer is consistent.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Decomposing the Parallelogram into Triangles**\n\n1. **Split the parallelogram into two congruent triangles:**\n   Each triangle has sides 8 inches and 15 inches, with an included angle of 120 degrees.\n\n2. **Calculate the area of one triangle:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b \\times \\sin(\\theta)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 15 \\times \\sin(120^\\circ)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 120 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 60 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 30\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total area of the parallelogram:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = 2 \\times 30\\sqrt{3} = 60\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis alternative approach also gives an area of \\(60\\sqrt{3}\\), confirming that the initial method was correct.\n\n**Check:**\nThe area remains consistent across different strategies, which adds confidence to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAfter exploring both methods, I can confidently conclude that the area of the parallelogram is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{60\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, applying the sine formula, checking calculations, and verifying with an alternative approach, I ensured accuracy and consistency in the solution. Throughout, reflecting on each step helped catch any potential missteps, leading to a correct and verified answer.",
