    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, simulating a human thought process with brainstorming, constant reflection, and checking along the way. \n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question, **\"Line $a$ is parallel to line $y=2x+4$ and passes through the point $(2,5)$. What is the y-intercept of line $a$?\"**, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Understanding Parallel Lines**: I remember that parallel lines have the same slope. So, line \\( a \\) should have the same slope as \\( y = 2x + 4 \\).\n\n2. **Y-Intercept Concept**: The y-intercept is where the line crosses the y-axis, meaning \\( x = 0 \\). I need to find the equation of line \\( a \\) and determine its y-intercept.\n\n3. **Possible Strategies**:\n   - **Point-Slope Form**: Use the given point \\( (2,5) \\) and the slope to write the equation.\n   - **Slope-Intercept Form**: Since I know the slope, I could directly write the equation and then find the y-intercept.\n   - **Standard Form**: Perhaps converting to standard form might help, but that seems unnecessary at this stage.\n\nReflecting on these, **the Point-Slope Form** seems like a direct approach since I have a point and the slope. But let me think this through a bit more.\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n- **Point-Slope Form**: This would involve using \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) is the given point.\n\n- **Slope-Intercept Form**: Since I know the slope is 2 (same as \\( y = 2x + 4 \\)), I could write the equation as \\( y = 2x + b \\) and then find \\( b \\) using the point \\( (2,5) \\).\n\n- **Graphical Approach**: If I had graph paper, plotting both lines might help visualize their relationship, but that's not practical here.\n\nLooking at these options, **using the Slope-Intercept Form** seems straightforward because I can directly apply the given point to find the y-intercept. **However**, it's essential to ensure this method aligns correctly with the Point-Slope Form to avoid any inconsistencies.\n\n### **Choosing a Strategy**\n\nI'll start with the **Slope-Intercept Form** because it aligns well with the given information and seems the most direct. If this approach doesn't pan out, I'll reconsider and possibly switch to the Point-Slope Form.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying the Slope**\n\nWait a moment\u2014**I need to ensure that the slope matches perfectly**. The given line is \\( y = 2x + 4 \\), so the slope \\( m \\) is **2**.\n\n**Reflection**: This makes sense because parallel lines share the same slope. I should be good to proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Writing the Equation in Slope-Intercept Form**\n\nGiven the slope is **2**, the equation of line \\( a \\) can be written as:\n\n\\[\ny = 2x + b\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( b \\) is the y-intercept we need to find.\n\n**Thought Process**: I know the line passes through \\( (2,5) \\), so I can substitute these values into the equation to solve for \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Substituting the Given Point**\n\nLet's substitute \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 5 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n5 = 2(2) + b\n\\]\n\n**Calculation**:\n\n\\[\n5 = 4 + b\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: So, \\( b = 5 - 4 = 1 \\). This means the y-intercept is **1**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Result**\n\nLet me quickly check if this makes sense. The equation of line \\( a \\) would be:\n\n\\[\ny = 2x + 1\n\\]\n\n- **Does it pass through \\( (2,5) \\)?** \n  - \\( 2(2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \\). Yes, it checks out.\n\n- **Is the slope correct?** \n  - The slope is **2**, same as the original line \\( y = 2x + 4 \\). So, the lines are indeed parallel.\n\n**Reflection**: Everything seems to align. The y-intercept is correctly calculated as **1**.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Point-Slope Form**\n\nJust to ensure robustness, let's briefly consider using the Point-Slope Form:\n\n\\[\ny - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( m = 2 \\)\n- \\( (x_1, y_1) = (2, 5) \\)\n\nSubstituting these values:\n\n\\[\ny - 5 = 2(x - 2)\n\\]\n\n**Calculation**:\n\n\\[\ny - 5 = 2x - 4\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 2x + 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: This reconfirms our earlier result. The equation is the same, and the y-intercept remains **1**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore concluding, let's do a final check:\n\n- **Slope Consistency**: Both approaches yield a slope of **2**.\n- **Point Verification**: The point \\( (2,5) \\) satisfies the equation \\( y = 2x + 1 \\).\n- **Y-Intercept**: Calculated as **1**, which aligns with both methods.\n\n**Thought Process**: Since both methods agree and the checks are consistent, I'm confident that the y-intercept of line \\( a \\) is indeed **1**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying through multiple approaches, **the y-intercept of line \\( a \\) is **1****. This step-by-step process ensured that each part of the problem was addressed, and constant checks validated the correctness of the solution.",
