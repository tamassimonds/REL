If that doesn't work or feels off, I can reconsider.\n\n### Step 2: **Implementing the Substitution Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **First, substitute \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) into the expression:**  \n  \\[\n  2 \\times x - 3 \\times y\n  \\]\n  Given \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\), it becomes:\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 2 - 3 \\times 1\n  \\]\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- **Multiplication First:**  \n  \\[\n  2 \\times 2 = 4\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 1 = 3\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Quick Check:** Does it make sense to multiply \\( 2 \\) by \\( 2 \\) and \\( 3 \\) by \\( 1 \\)? Yes, straightforward.\n- **Next Step:** Subtract the two results.\n\n**Continuing with Calculation:**  \n\\[\n4 - 3 = 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: **Checking the Work**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Is the subtraction correct?**  \n  \\( 4 - 3 \\) clearly equals \\( 1 \\).\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  - **Does this match my expectations?** The numbers are simple, and the operations follow the order correctly. It seems reasonable.\n  - **Could there be another approach?** While substitution worked well here, checking if simplification before substitution helps might be useful for more complex problems.\n\n**Natural Check:**  \n- **Does the answer make sense?**  \n  Yes, subtracting \\( 3 \\) from \\( 4 \\) gives \\( 1 \\), and the operations were performed in the correct order.\n\n### Step 4: **Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **Alternative Approach:** Maybe factor the expression or look for common terms, but that seems unnecessary here since it's simple.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- **Wait a moment:** The expression was straightforward. Attempting to factor or simplify might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Best Strategy:** Stick with the substitution method. It was direct and efficient for this problem.\n\n### Step 5: **Final Reflection and Answer**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \n- **Does everything align?**  \n  - Substituting \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\) into the expression worked perfectly.\n  - The order of operations was followed correctly.\n  - The final result makes sense numerically.\n\n- **Could there be any hidden issues?**  \n  No, the calculations are simple, and each step logically follows the previous one.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n2 \\times x - 3 \\times y = 1\n\\]\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Approach Worked:** The substitution method directly answered the question without complications.\n- **Checked Along the Way:** Ensured each step was correct before moving forward.\n- **Alternative Strategies Considered:** While other methods were brainstormed, they weren't necessary for this simple problem.\n\nReflecting throughout helped confirm that the initial approach was correct and that no additional complexity was needed. Always good to double-check, especially when starting, to ensure the path taken is the right one.",
