    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem just like we would if we were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their effectiveness, and be open to adjusting my approach as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the problem, I see that we're dealing with a **unit cube** and need to find the **distance from a vertex \\(C\\) to the line connecting two opposite corners \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)**. \n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Unit Cube Basics:** I remember that in a unit cube, all edges are of length 1. That's important for our calculations.\n  \n- **Understanding Opposite Corners:** \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) being opposite corners means they are diagonally across from each other. In a coordinate system, this typically means \\(A = (0,0,0)\\) and \\(B = (1,1,1)\\).\n\n- **Choosing Vertex \\(C\\):** The problem asks for another vertex different from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), so let's think about the remaining vertices: \\((1,0,0)\\), \\((0,1,0)\\), \\((0,0,1)\\), etc.\n\n- **Visualizing the Cube:** Maybe drawing a sketch or imagining the cube might help in understanding the geometry better.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure which method to use\u2014geometry, vectors, or perhaps coordinates. Let me explore a few strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Geometric Visualization**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Try to visually understand where \\(C\\) is in relation to the line \\(AB\\). Maybe drawing it out can help.\n  \n- **Reflection:** Drawing might give a better spatial sense, but it's not precise enough for calculating distances.\n\n- **Conclusion:** This approach is useful for intuition but not practical for exact calculations.\n\n**Strategy 2: Use Coordinate Geometry**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Assign coordinates to each vertex and use distance formulas to find the necessary lengths.\n\n- **Reflection:** This seems like a solid approach since we can calculate exact distances.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Let's proceed with this method.\n\n**Strategy 3: Vector Approach**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Use vectors to represent the line \\(AB\\) and the position of \\(C\\), then apply vector projections to find the perpendicular distance.\n\n- **Reflection:** This is mathematically rigorous and should work well for finding the distance.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Combining vector methods with coordinate geometry might be the most effective path.\n\n**Strategy 4: Cross Product Method**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Use the cross product of vectors to find a vector perpendicular to \\(AB\\), then use it to find the distance.\n\n- **Reflection:** This is a well-known technique for finding distances from points to lines in 3D space.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Let's use this method as it aligns well with the vector approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Steps Using Strategy 4: Cross Product Method**\n\nLet\u2019s proceed step by step, integrating the strategies we've chosen.\n\n#### **Step 1: Assign Coordinates**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Assign coordinates to the cube\u2019s vertices to facilitate calculations.\n\n- **Action:** Let\u2019s define the cube in a 3D space with:\n  - \\(A = (0, 0, 0)\\)\n  - \\(B = (1, 1, 1)\\)\n  - Choose \\(C = (1, 0, 0)\\) as another vertex.\n\n- **Reflection:** This choice simplifies calculations since \\(C\\) has two coordinates different from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n#### **Step 2: Define Vectors**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Represent the line \\(AB\\) as a vector and \\(C\\) as another point vector.\n\n- **Action:**\n  - Vector \\( \\mathbf{AB} = \\mathbf{B} - \\mathbf{A} = (1, 1, 1) - (0, 0, 0) = (1, 1, 1)\\)\n  - Vector \\( \\mathbf{AC} = \\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{A} = (1, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 0) = (1, 0, 0)\\)\n\n- **Reflection:** Having these vectors helps in visualizing the geometric relationships and setting up the next steps.\n\n#### **Step 3: Compute Cross Product**\n\n- **Thought Process:** The cross product of \\( \\mathbf{AB} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{AC} \\) will give a vector perpendicular to both, which can be used to find the distance from \\(C\\) to the line \\(AB\\).\n\n- **Action:**\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{AB} \\times \\mathbf{AC} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n  \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\\n  1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 0\n  \\end{vmatrix}\n  \\]\n  - Calculating the determinant:\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{AB} \\times \\mathbf{AC} = \\mathbf{i}(1 \\cdot 0 - 1 \\cdot 0) - \\mathbf{j}(1 \\cdot 0 - 1 \\cdot 1) + \\mathbf{k}(1 \\cdot 0 - 1 \\cdot 1)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\mathbf{i}(0) - \\mathbf{j}(-1) + \\mathbf{k}(-1)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = (0, 1, -1)\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This perpendicular vector is crucial for determining the distance. It indicates the direction orthogonal to \\(AB\\).\n\n#### **Step 4: Calculate Magnitude of the Cross Product**\n\n- **Thought Process:** The magnitude of the cross product vector represents twice the area of the parallelogram formed by \\( \\mathbf{AB} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{AC} \\).\n\n- **Action:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Magnitude} = \\sqrt{0^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** The magnitude being \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is consistent with the geometry of the cube.\n\n#### **Step 5: Calculate the Distance from \\(C\\) to \\(AB\\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** The distance from a point to a line in 3D can be computed using the formula:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{AB} \\times \\mathbf{AC}\\|}{\\|\\mathbf{AB}\\|}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Action:**\n  - Calculate \\( \\|\\mathbf{AB}\\| \\):\n    \\[\n    \\|\\mathbf{AB}\\| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{3}\n    \\]\n  - Now, use the distance formula:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Distance} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\n    \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This result logically fits within the unit cube's dimensions. The distance makes sense spatially, being less than the cube's diagonal but more than zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\n- **Quick Check:** The distance \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3} \\) is approximately 0.8165, which is reasonable given the cube's dimensions.\n\n- **Deeper Reflection:** Given that the unit cube has diagonals of length \\( \\sqrt{3} \\), a distance of \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3} \\) aligns well. It's less than half the cube's diagonal but more than the shortest possible distance (which would be zero if \\(C\\) were on \\(AB\\)).\n\n- **Random Insight:** This method effectively uses vector properties to simplify the problem, which confirms its correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternate Approach: Using Projections**\n\nLet\u2019s brainstorm and explore another method to ensure our solution is robust.\n\n**Strategy: Vector Projections**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Instead of using the cross product, we could project vector \\( \\mathbf{AC} \\) onto \\( \\mathbf{AB} \\) to directly find the length along \\( \\mathbf{AB} \\) and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the perpendicular distance.\n\n- **Action:**\n  - Compute the projection of \\( \\mathbf{AC} \\) onto \\( \\mathbf{AB} \\):\n    \\[\n    \\text{Proj}_{\\mathbf{AB}} \\mathbf{AC} = \\frac{\\mathbf{AC} \\cdot \\mathbf{AB}}{\\|\\mathbf{AB}\\|^2} \\mathbf{AB}\n    \\]\n    - First, calculate the dot product:\n      \\[\n      \\mathbf{AC} \\cdot \\mathbf{AB} = (1, 0, 0) \\cdot (1, 1, 1) = 1 \\times 1 + 0 \\times 1 + 0 \\times 1 = 1\n      \\]\n    - Then, the projection:\n      \\[\n      \\text{Proj}_{\\mathbf{AB}} \\mathbf{AC} = \\frac{1}{3} \\mathbf{AB} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}\\right)\n      \\]\n  - Now, find the vector from \\(C\\) to this projection point:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{C} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}\\right) - (1, 0, 0) = \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}\\right)\n    \\]\n  - Calculate the magnitude of this vector:\n    \\[\n    \\|\\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{C}\\| = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\n    \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** This alternative method miraculously yields the same distance, \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3} \\), confirming our original approach's correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy exploring different strategies\u2014geometric visualization, coordinate geometry, vector methods, and specifically the cross product\u2014we arrived at the same consistent distance. Checking the work along the way ensured the validity of our solution.\n\n- **Key Insights:**\n  - **Vector Cross Product:** Particularly effective in 3D for finding distances from points to lines.\n  - **Projection Method:** Provides an alternate verification, reinforcing the accuracy of the distance calculated.\n\n- **Potential Mistakes to Avoid:**\n  - **Miscalculating Dot Products or Cross Products:** Can lead to incorrect distance values.\n  - **Overlooking Magnitudes:** Ensuring to divide by the magnitude of \\( \\mathbf{AB} \\) is crucial for the correct distance.\n\n- **Final Answer:** The distance from vertex \\(C\\) to line \\(AB\\) is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}}\n\\]\n\nThis thorough step-by-step approach, reflecting on different strategies and consistently checking the work, ensures a human-like, reflective, and accurate problem-solving process.",
