When dealing with fractions, I remember that they become **undefined** when the denominator is **zero**. \n- **Possible Strategies:** So, to find the values of \\( x \\) that make the expression undefined, I need to identify when the denominator equals zero. This reminds me of solving rational equations where finding restrictions is crucial.\n- **Alternative Approaches:** Maybe I could directly set the denominator to zero and solve for \\( x \\). Or perhaps factor the denominator to make the equation easier to solve.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Direct Method:** Set the denominator equal to zero: \\( x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0 \\). This seems straightforward.\n- **Factoring Method:** Before jumping into solving, maybe I can try factoring the quadratic to see if it's easily solvable.\n- **Checking for Alternatives:** Is there another method like completing the square or using the quadratic formula? But factoring seems simpler initially.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this Make Sense?** Setting the denominator to zero should give the values where the expression is undefined. This aligns with my initial understanding.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting the Denominator to Zero**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- **Action:** I\u2019ll set the denominator equal to zero:  \n  \\[\n  x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Why This Works:** By finding \\( x \\) where the denominator is zero, I identify the points that make the expression undefined, which is exactly what the problem asks for.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Attempting to Factor:**\n  - Looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-3\\) (the constant term) and add up to \\(2\\) (the coefficient of \\( x \\)).\n  - Possible pairs: \\((-1, 3)\\), \\((1, -3)\\), \\((3, -1)\\), \\((-3, 1)\\).\n  - The pair that adds up to \\(2\\) is \\((-1, 3)\\).\n\n- **Factoring the Quadratic:**\n  \\[\n  x^2 + 2x - 3 = (x - 1)(x + 3)\n  \\]\n  \n  **Reflection:**\n  - **Checking Factorization:** Multiply back to verify:  \n    \\[\n    (x - 1)(x + 3) = x^2 + 3x - x - 3 = x^2 + 2x - 3\n    \\]  \n    - **Conclusion:** This matches the original equation, so the factorization is correct.\n\n**Wait a Moment:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does factoring simplify the problem? Yes, now I can easily find the roots.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\n- **Proceeding with Factored Equation:** Set each factor to zero to find the values of \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Factored Equation**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- **Action:** Solve \\( (x - 1)(x + 3) = 0 \\) by setting each factor to zero:\n  \\[\n  x - 1 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x + 3 = 0\n  \\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Solving for \\( x \\):**\n  \\[\n  x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x + 3 = 0 \\implies x = -3\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Checking Solutions:**  \n  - **\\( x = 1 \\):** Substituting back into the denominator:  \n    \\[\n    1^2 + 2(1) - 3 = 1 + 2 - 3 = 0\n    \\]  \n    - **Result:** Denominator is zero, so the expression is indeed undefined.\n    \n  - **\\( x = -3 \\):** Substituting back into the denominator:  \n    \\[\n    (-3)^2 + 2(-3) - 3 = 9 - 6 - 3 = 0\n    \\]  \n    - **Result:** Denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Both \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\) make the denominator zero, aligning with the problem's requirements. This confirms that our factored equation approach is correct.\n\n**Possible Misstep:**\n\n- **Thinking:** Initially, I considered using the quadratic formula, but factoring provided an easier path. Always good to reflect and choose the simplest method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Product of All \\( x \\) That Make the Expression Undefined**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- **Action:** Now that I've identified \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -3 \\) as the values where the expression is undefined, I need to find their product:  \n  \\[\n  x = 1 \\times (-3) = -3\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Why Multiply?** The problem asks for the product of all \\( x \\) that make the expression undefined. Since there are two such \\( x \\) values, their product is needed.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check the Logic:**  \n  - **Does multiplying these two make sense?** Yes, since both values lead to an undefined expression, their product is a valid result.\n  \n    **Quick Check:**  \n    - **Negative Sign:** Multiplying a positive and a negative number correctly results in a negative product, \\(-3\\).\n\n    **Potential Check:**  \n    - **Absolute Values:** Absolute value of the product is \\( 3 \\), which seems reasonable given the context.\n  \n  - **Confident in Approach:** The steps logically lead to the solution.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**\n\n- **Could Use Vieta\u2019s Formulas:**  \n  - **Thought:** The product of the roots of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{c}{a} \\).\n  - **Application:** Here, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), \\( c = -3 \\), so the product of the roots is:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{-3}{1} = -3\n    \\]\n    \n  **Reflection:**  \n  - **Does This Align?** Yes, this confirms our earlier calculation using direct multiplication.\n\n  **Check:**  \n  - **Is This Correct?** Both methods yield the same product, \\(-3\\), validating the correctness.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Does the Answer Make Sense?**  \n  - **Real-world Connection:** In real-world scenarios, having a negative product could imply an inverse relationship or cancellation effect, which is plausible here.\n  - **Numerical Reasonability:** The magnitude of the product, \\( 3 \\), is reasonable given the values involved.\n  \n- **Confidence Level:**  \n  - **High Confidence:** Multiple methods lead to the same answer, and the logic holds throughout the steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the problem, exploring different strategies, and verifying each step, the product of all \\( x \\) such that the expression  \n\\[\n\\frac{x^2 + 2x + 1}{x^2 + 2x - 3}\n\\]  \nis undefined is  \n\\[\n\\boxed{-3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection Summary**\n\n- **Initial Approach Worked:** Starting by setting the denominator to zero was the correct path.\n- **Factoring Simplified the Problem:** Factoring the quadratic made it easy to identify the undefined points.\n- **Multiple Verification Methods Confirmed the Answer:** Using both direct multiplication of roots and Vieta\u2019s formulas validated the product.\n- **Continuous Reflection Ensured Accuracy:** Regular checks throughout the process helped catch and confirm the correctness of each step.\n\nBy thinking through each part and being open to adjusting the approach, I ensured the solution was both accurate and logically sound.",

Since the discriminant of this quadratic is $2^2 - 4(1)(-3) = 16$, which is positive, we know that the roots of $x^2 +2x-3$ are distinct real numbers.  The product of the roots of a quadratic of the form of $ax^2+bx+c$ is equal to $\\frac{c}{a}$, so the desired product of the values of $x$ for which $x^2 + 2x - 3=0$ is $\\frac{-3}{1}$, or $\\boxed{-3}$."
