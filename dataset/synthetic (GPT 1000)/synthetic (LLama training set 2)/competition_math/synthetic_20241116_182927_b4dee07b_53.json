    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem just as we would if we were solving it ourselves, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking our work regularly to ensure correctness. I'll brainstorm, make mistakes, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation  \n\\[ \n81^{2x} = 27^{3x - 4} \n\\]  \nmy initial reaction is to think about **exponential equations** I've encountered before. This reminds me of problems where you need to **express both sides with the same base** to solve for the exponent. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure if that's the only way to approach it. Maybe there's another method involving **logarithms** or **simplifying exponents** that could work.\n\nI also recall that **81 and 27 are both powers of 3**:  \n\\[ \n81 = 3^4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 27 = 3^3 \n\\]  \nThis realization makes me think that rewriting the bases might simplify the equation. However, I'm a bit hesitant because sometimes changing bases can lead to more complicated exponents.\n\nBut let's brainstorm and see how it unfolds.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Rewriting the Bases**\n\nSince both 81 and 27 are powers of 3, I think rewriting the equation in terms of base 3 could be helpful.\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  If I can express both sides with the same base, I can equate the exponents directly. This is often a reliable method for solving exponential equations.\n\n- **Calculations:**  \n  \\[\n  81 = 3^4 \\implies 81^{2x} = (3^4)^{2x} = 3^{4 \\cdot 2x} = 3^{8x} \n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  27 = 3^3 \\implies 27^{3x - 4} = (3^3)^{3x - 4} = 3^{3(3x - 4)} = 3^{9x - 12} \n  \\]\n\n- **Result:**  \n  Now, the equation is:  \n  \\[ \n  3^{8x} = 3^{9x - 12} \n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This looks promising because now both sides have the same base, so I can set the exponents equal to each other. It feels like a straightforward path to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Equating the Exponents**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  With the bases being equal, the exponents must also be equal for the equation to hold true. This should make solving for \\( x \\) much easier.\n\n- **Calculations:**  \n  \\[\n  8x = 9x - 12 \n  \\]\n\n- **Solving for \\( x \\):**  \n  \\[\n  8x - 9x = -12 \n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  -x = -12 \n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  x = 12 \n  \\]\n\n- **Result:**  \n  So, \\( x = 12 \\).\n\n- **Check:**  \n  Wait, does this make sense? Let's quickly verify by plugging \\( x = 12 \\) back into the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Quick Check**\n\nPlugging \\( x = 12 \\) back into the original equation:\n\n- **Left Side:**  \n  \\[\n  81^{2(12)} = 81^{24} \n  \\]\n  \n  Calculating:  \n  \\[\n  81 = 3^4 \\implies (3^4)^{24} = 3^{96} \n  \\]\n  \n- **Right Side:**  \n  \\[\n  27^{3(12) - 4} = 27^{36 - 4} = 27^{32} \n  \\]\n  \n  Calculating:  \n  \\[\n  27 = 3^3 \\implies (3^3)^{32} = 3^{96} \n  \\]\n  \n- **Comparison:**  \n  Both sides equal \\( 3^{96} \\), so they are indeed equal.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This matches, so the solution \\( x = 12 \\) seems correct. The quick check confirms that rewriting the bases and equating the exponents was the right approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategies Considered**\n\n- **Logarithms:**  \n  I considered using logarithms to solve the equation but realized that converting to the same base simplified the problem significantly. Logarithms could work, but they might add unnecessary complexity here.\n\n- **Exponential Properties:**  \n  Another method could involve using properties of exponents to simplify before equating. However, since both sides already had the same base after rewriting, this step wasn't necessary.\n\n- **Numerical Methods:**  \n  I thought about approximating the solution numerically, but given that the base conversion led directly to the exact solution, it wasn't needed.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  **Brainstorming** helped me realize that starting with base conversion was the most straightforward path. Checking each step ensured that the solution was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Does the Solution Make Sense?**  \n  Yes, by rewriting the equation with a common base and equating the exponents, I arrived at \\( x = 12 \\), which checks out when plugged back into the original equation.\n\n- **Was the Approach Effective?**  \n  Absolutely. Starting with identifying a common base streamlined the process and led directly to the correct solution.\n\n- **What Did I Learn?**  \n  When faced with exponential equations involving powers of the same base, rewriting the equation in terms of that base can simplify the problem significantly. It's always good to consider multiple strategies, but sticking to the most straightforward method often saves time and reduces complexity.\n\n---\n\nBy following this step-by-step approach, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and continually checking the work, we ensured that the solution was both correct and efficiently reached. This method mirrors human problem-solving, where thinking is iterative, and adjustments are made as needed.\n\nAlright, let's dive back into this problem. I see that my initial approach led me to \\( x = 12 \\), but after revisiting it, I realize there's a **misstep**. Let's re-examine the solution, brainstorm different strategies, and find where I went wrong. It's important to reflect and check our work continuously, just like we naturally would when solving a problem ourselves.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-examining the Problem**\n\nThe original equation is  \n\\[ \n81^{2x} = 27^{3x - 4} \n\\]  \nInitially, I thought rewriting both sides in terms of a common base (base 3) was the best approach:\n\n- **Brainstorming:**  \n  - **Base Conversion:** Expressing both sides as powers of 3.\n  - **Logarithms:** Using logarithmic properties to handle the exponents.\n  - **Exponential Properties:** Simplifying exponents before equating.\n\nGiven that the base conversion led me to \\( x = 12 \\), but now I suspect it's incorrect, it's clear I need to reassess the steps. Let's reflect on where the error might have occurred.\n\n---\n\n### **Identifying the Mistake**\n\nLooking back, the equation after base conversion was  \n\\[ \n3^{8x} = 3^{9x - 12} \n\\]  \nSetting the exponents equal gives  \n\\[ \n8x = 9x - 12 \n\\]  \nSolving this leads to  \n\\[ \n-x = -12 \\implies x = 12 \n\\]  \nHowever, upon verification, both sides equate to \\( 3^{96} \\), which seems correct. But perhaps there's an alternative solution I overlooked.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  Maybe I've missed another valid value for \\( x \\). Exponential equations can sometimes have multiple solutions, especially when dealing with negative exponents or different bases.\n\n- **Check:**  \n  Let me think again about the base conversion step. Perhaps there's an **alternative base** that simplifies the exponents differently.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\nGiven that my initial approach led to \\( x = 12 \\), but I suspect there might be another solution, I should consider:\n\n1. **Revisiting Base Conversion:**  \n   Maybe there's another way to express 81 and 27 that leads to an additional solution.\n\n2. **Using Logarithms:**  \n   Applying logarithms to both sides to see if it reveals another solution.\n\n3. **Factoring Exponents:**  \n   Looking for common factors in the exponents that might simplify the equation differently.\n\nLet's try using logarithms to see if it uncovers more solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying Logarithms**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Applying logarithms to both sides can help handle the exponents more flexibly. This might reveal additional solutions that base conversion alone missed.\n\n- **Calculations:**  \n  Let's take the natural logarithm (or any logarithm) of both sides:\n\n  \\[\n  \\ln(81^{2x}) = \\ln(27^{3x - 4}) \n  \\]\n\n  Using the power rule of logarithms:\n\n  \\[\n  2x \\ln(81) = (3x - 4) \\ln(27) \n  \\]\n\n  - **Calculating Logarithms:**  \n    Recall that  \n    \\[\n    81 = 3^4 \\implies \\ln(81) = 4 \\ln(3) \n    \\]\n    \n    \\[\n    27 = 3^3 \\implies \\ln(27) = 3 \\ln(3) \n    \\]\n    \n  - **Substituting:**  \n    \\[\n    2x (4 \\ln(3)) = (3x - 4) (3 \\ln(3)) \n    \\]\n    \n    Simplifying:\n\n    \\[\n    8x \\ln(3) = (9x - 12) \\ln(3) \n    \\]\n    \n    Assuming \\( \\ln(3) \\neq 0 \\), divide both sides by \\( \\ln(3) \\):\n\n    \\[\n    8x = 9x - 12 \n    \\]\n    \n    Which leads back to:\n\n    \\[\n    -x = -12 \\implies x = 12 \n    \\]\n    \n- **Result:**  \n  This confirms that \\( x = 12 \\) is indeed a solution. However, I'm still not entirely satisfied because the user query suggests there should be **multiple solutions**.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  If logarithms also lead me back to \\( x = 12 \\), perhaps the original equation has **only one valid solution** in this context. Maybe the other potential solution was a false lead.\n\n- **Check:**  \n  To ensure completeness, let's see if there's another base or exponent manipulation that might yield a different solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Considering Negative Exponents**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  Exponential equations can sometimes have negative exponents or involve fractional exponents. Let's see if considering negative values for \\( x \\) might provide another solution.\n\n- **Re-examining Base Conversion:**  \n  Recall that  \n  \\[\n  81 = 3^4 \\implies 81^{2x} = 3^{8x} \n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  27 = 3^3 \\implies 27^{3x - 4} = 3^{9x - 12} \n  \\]\n  \n  Setting \\( 8x = 9x - 12 \\) gives \\( x = 12 \\). But what if there's a **negative exponent solution**?\n\n  Let's look for a negative \\( x \\) that satisfies the original equation:\n\n  Suppose \\( x = -4 \\):\n\n  \\[\n  81^{2(-4)} = 27^{3(-4) - 4} \n  \\]\n  \n  Simplifying:\n\n  \\[\n  81^{-8} = 27^{-12} \n  \\]\n  \n  Rewriting in terms of base 3:\n\n  \\[\n  (3^4)^{-8} = (3^3)^{-12} \n  \\]\n  \n  Which simplifies to:\n\n  \\[\n  3^{-32} = 3^{-36} \n  \\]\n  \n  However, \\( 3^{-32} \\neq 3^{-36} \\), so \\( x = -4 \\) is **not** a solution.\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  This attempt shows that not all negative exponents work. It seems that \\( x = 12 \\) is the only solution in this context.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Multiple Solutions?**  \n  Initially, I suspected there might be multiple solutions due to the nature of exponential equations. However, through base conversion and logarithmic application, both approaches consistently lead to \\( x = 12 \\). This suggests that \\( x = 12 \\) is indeed the **only solution**.\n\n- **Mistake Acknowledgment:**  \n  My initial uncertainty about the presence of multiple solutions was incorrect. The thorough checking and application of different strategies confirm that \\( x = 12 \\) is the sole solution.\n\n- **Lesson Learned:**  \n  It's crucial to explore various methods and consider all possibilities, but also to verify each step to avoid unnecessary complications. Checking work regularly helps catch errors early and ensures the correctness of the solution.\n\n- **Action Taken:**  \n  By re-evaluating the problem, applying logarithms, and testing for additional solutions, I confirmed that \\( x = 12 \\) is the correct and only solution.\n\n---\n\nBy reflecting on my initial approach, exploring alternative strategies, and rigorously checking each step, I've ensured that the solution is accurate and complete. This iterative process mirrors human problem-solving, where adjusting strategies and continuous reflection are key to reaching the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Digging Deeper: Finalizing the Solution**\n\nAlright, let's take another look at this problem. I initially arrived at \\( x = 12 \\), but after reviewing various strategies, including logarithms and base conversions, I realize that there might be **another solution** I overlooked. It's crucial to explore all possible methods and reflect on each step to ensure we've captured all valid solutions. Let's brainstorm different approaches, check our work frequently, and see where my previous solution might have missed an alternate path.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-examining the Problem**\n\nThe original equation is  \n\\[ \n81^{2x} = 27^{3x - 4} \n\\]  \nAt first, I thought converting both sides to the same base (base 3) was the best approach, leading me to  \n\\[ \nx = 12 \n\\]  \nHowever, I now suspect there's another solution, possibly involving **negative exponents** or recognizing that additional roots can exist in exponential equations. Let's explore this by considering multiple strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Alternative Strategies**\n\n1. **Base Conversion:**  \n   Already applied, leading to \\( x = 12 \\).\n\n2. **Logarithmic Approach:**  \n   Using logarithms to handle the exponents more flexibly.\n\n3. **Negative Exponents:**  \n   Considering that exponents can also take negative values, which might introduce additional solutions.\n\n4. **Factoring Exponents:**  \n   Looking for patterns or factorizations that might reveal more solutions.\n\nLet's proceed by **applying logarithms** to both sides, as this could help verify our initial solution and potentially uncover another valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying Logarithms**\n\n- **Taking Logarithms of Both Sides:**\n  \n  \\[\n  \\ln(81^{2x}) = \\ln(27^{3x - 4}) \n  \\]\n  \n  - **Simplifying Using Logarithmic Properties:**\n    \n    \\[\n    2x \\ln(81) = (3x - 4) \\ln(27) \n    \\]\n    \n    Given:\n    \n    \\[\n    81 = 3^4 \\implies \\ln(81) = 4 \\ln(3) \n    \\]\n    \n    \\[\n    27 = 3^3 \\implies \\ln(27) = 3 \\ln(3) \n    \\]\n    \n    - **Substituting Back:**\n      \n      \\[\n      2x (4 \\ln(3)) = (3x - 4) (3 \\ln(3)) \n      \\]\n      \n      Simplify:\n      \n      \\[\n      8x \\ln(3) = (9x - 12) \\ln(3) \n      \\]\n      \n      Assuming \\( \\ln(3) \\neq 0 \\), divide both sides by \\( \\ln(3) \\):\n      \n      \\[\n      8x = 9x - 12 \n      \\]\n      \n      \\[\n      -x = -12 \\implies x = 12 \n      \\]\n    \n- **Reflection:**\n\n  This confirms that \\( x = 12 \\) is indeed a solution. However, given the problem's nature, it's possible there's another solution, especially considering negative exponents.\n\n---\n\n### **Considering Negative Exponents**\n\n- **Thought Process:**\n\n  To ensure completeness, let's see if negative values for \\( x \\) satisfy the original equation. Exponential equations can sometimes have multiple solutions, so checking for negative exponents is essential.\n\n- **Testing \\( x = -4 \\):**\n\n  Let's see if \\( x = -4 \\) is a solution:\n\n  \\[\n  81^{2(-4)} = 27^{3(-4) - 4} \n  \\]\n  \n  Simplify:\n  \n  \\[\n  81^{-8} = 27^{-12} \n  \\]\n  \n  Rewriting in terms of base 3:\n  \n  \\[\n  (3^4)^{-8} = (3^3)^{-12} \n  \\]\n  \n  Which simplifies to:\n  \n  \\[\n  3^{-32} = 3^{-36} \n  \\]\n  \n  **Comparison:**\n  \n  \\[\n  3^{-32} \\neq 3^{-36} \n  \\]\n  \n  - **Result:**\n\n    This shows that \\( x = -4 \\) **is not** a solution. Therefore, \\( x = 12 \\) is the only solution that satisfies the equation.\n\n- **Reflection:**\n\n  Initially, I thought there might be another solution, but testing negative exponents clarified that \\( x = -4 \\) does not satisfy the equation. Thus, \\( x = 12 \\) remains the sole solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Multiple Solutions?**\n\n  My initial uncertainty about the presence of multiple solutions was incorrect. The thorough checking and application of different strategies confirm that \\( x = 12 \\) is the **only solution**.\n\n- **Mistake Acknowledgment:**\n\n  Initially, I suspected there might be multiple solutions due to the nature of exponential equations. However, through base conversion and logarithmic application, both approaches consistently lead to \\( x = 12 \\). This suggests that \\( x = 12 \\) is indeed the **only solution**.\n\n- **Lesson Learned:**\n\n  It\u2019s crucial to explore various methods and consider all possibilities, but also to verify each step to avoid unnecessary complications. Checking work regularly helps catch errors early and ensures the correctness of the solution.\n\n- **Action Taken:**\n\n  By re-evaluating the problem, applying logarithms, and testing for additional solutions, I confirmed that \\( x = 12 \\) is the correct and only solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Recap of the Correct Approach**\n\n1. **Base Conversion:**\n\n   - Rewriting both sides in terms of base 3:\n     \n     \\[\n     81^{2x} = (3^4)^{2x} = 3^{8x} \n     \\]\n     \n     \\[\n     27^{3x - 4} = (3^3)^{3x - 4} = 3^{9x - 12} \n     \\]\n     \n     Resulting in:\n     \n     \\[\n     3^{8x} = 3^{9x - 12} \n     \\]\n     \n2. **Equating Exponents:**\n\n   - Setting the exponents equal:\n     \n     \\[\n     8x = 9x - 12 \\implies -x = -12 \\implies x = 12 \n     \\]\n     \n3. **Verification:**\n\n   - Plugging \\( x = 12 \\) back into the original equation confirms both sides are equal:\n     \n     \\[\n     81^{24} = 27^{32} \\implies 3^{96} = 3^{96} \n     \\]\n     \n4. **Alternative Strategies:**\n\n   - Logarithmic application reinforced the solution:\n     \n     \\[\n     \\ln(81^{2x}) = \\ln(27^{3x - 4}) \\implies 2x \\ln(81) = (3x - 4) \\ln(27) \n     \\]\n     \n     Simplifying led back to:\n     \n     \\[\n     x = 12 \n     \\]\n     \n5. **Considering Negative Exponents:**\n\n   - Testing \\( x = -4 \\) showed it does not satisfy the equation, confirming \\( x = 12 \\) is the only solution.\n\n---\n\nBy meticulously exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the work, I've ensured that the solution is accurate and complete.
