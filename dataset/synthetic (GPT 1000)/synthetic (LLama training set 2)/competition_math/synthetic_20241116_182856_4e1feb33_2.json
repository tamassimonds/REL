    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem thinking it through step-by-step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work as I go. Let's see where it takes me.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the problem, it asks for the number of positive three-digit integers that:\n\n1. **Contain at least one '3' as a digit.**\n2. **Do Not contain a '5' as a digit.**\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** This pops into my mind because we have conditions involving the presence of '3' and the absence of '5'.\n- **Counting Total Three-Digit Numbers Without '5':** Maybe I can start by figuring out how many three-digit numbers don't have '5' at all.\n- **Subtracting Unwanted Cases:** Another idea is to subtract numbers without '3' and without '5' from the total.\n- **Direct Enumeration:** List out the valid numbers, but that seems tedious for such a large range.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Inclusion-Exclusion:** Seems promising because it deals with multiple conditions.\n- **Counting Without '5':** This could be a good starting point to understand the total pool we\u2019re working with.\n- **Direct Enumeration:** Probably impractical due to the sheer number.\n\nI think starting with counting the total three-digit numbers that don't contain '5' is a good approach. Then, I can apply the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to narrow it down to those containing at least one '3'.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Counting Total Three-Digit Numbers Without '5'**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Three-digit numbers range from 100 to 999.\n- I need to count how many of these numbers have digits other than '5'.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Cannot be '5'.\n   - Possible digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (8 options)\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Cannot be '5'.\n   - Possible digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (9 options)\n\n3. **Units Place:**\n   - Cannot be '5'.\n   - Possible digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (9 options)\n\n**Total Numbers Without '5':**\n\\[\n8 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 648\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Quick Check:** 648 seems reasonable for three-digit numbers. I\u2019ll move forward with this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to count the numbers without '5' that also **contain at least one '3'**.\n- Inclusion-Exclusion will help avoid double counting.\n\n**Let\u2019s Define Sets:**\n- **Set A:** Three-digit numbers without '5'.\n- **Set B:** Three-digit numbers without '5' and without '3'.\n\n**Objective:**\nFind **|A| - |B|**, where |A| is the total without '5', and |B| is the total without both '3' and '5'.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **Total Without '5' (|A|):** Already \u0648\u062c\u062f\u0647\u0627\u060c 648.\n\n2. **Total Without '3' and '5' (|B|):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Cannot be '3' or '5': 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (7 options)\n   - **Tens Place:** Cannot be '3' or '5': 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (8 options)\n   - **Units Place:** Cannot be '3' or '5': 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 (8 options)\n\n\\[\n|B| = 7 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 448\n\\]\n\n3. **Numbers Without '5' But Containing '3':**\n\\[\n|A| - |B| = 648 - 448 = 200\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Quick Check:** 200 seems like a manageable number. I\u2019ll proceed with this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Did I Count Everything Correctly?**\n- |A| is the total without '5'.\n- |B| is the total without both '3' and '5'.\n- Subtracting |B| from |A| gives those that have '3' and don't have '5'.\n\n**Wait, Does This Make Sense?**\n- Yes, we're accurately filtering out the numbers that don't meet the criteria.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- **Sample Calculation:** If we take a random number like 231:\n  - It contains '3' and doesn't have '5'. Should be included.\n- **Contradictory Example:** 211:\n  - It doesn't contain '3', so it shouldn\u2019t be included.\n\n**Outcome:**\n- The approach seems correct. No contradictory examples.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe number of positive three-digit integers that contain at least one '3' as a digit but do not contain a '5' as a digit is **200**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorming Helped:** Starting by counting the total numbers without '5' laid a solid foundation.\n- **Inclusion-Exclusion Worked Well:** It efficiently handled the multiple conditions without double counting.\n- **Reflection and Checking Were Key:** Periodically checking the intermediate steps ensured the correctness of the approach.\n- **Avoiding Direct Enumeration:** It saved time and effort, making the solution more elegant.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with constant reflection and checking, led to a confident and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Let us consider the number of three-digit integers that do not contain $3$ and $5$ as digits; let this set be $S$. For any such number, there would be $7$ possible choices for the hundreds digit (excluding $0,3$, and $5$), and $8$ possible choices for each of the tens and ones digits. Thus, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = 448$ three-digit integers without a $3$ or $5$.\n\nNow, we count the number of three-digit integers that just do not contain a $5$ as a digit; let this set be $T$. There would be $8$ possible choices for the hundreds digit, and $9$ for each of the others, giving $8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 9 = 648$. By the complementary principle, the set of three-digit integers with at least one $3$ and no $5$s is the number of integers in $T$ but not $S$. There are $648 - 448 = \\boxed{200}$ such numbers."
