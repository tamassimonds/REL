I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and ensuring that I'm on the right track throughout.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nOkay, so the problem is:  \n**Compute** \\( (17 + 10)^2 - (17 - 10)^2 \\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**  \n- **Familiar Structure:** This expression reminds me of the **difference of squares** formula:  \n  \\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\]  \n  Maybe I can use that here.\n  \n- **Alternative Approaches:**  \n  - **Expand Both Terms:** I could expand \\( (17 + 10)^2 \\) and \\( (17 - 10)^2 \\) separately and then subtract them.\n  - **Use the Formula Directly:** If the difference of squares idea applies, that might simplify things.\n  \n- **Thinking Out Loud:**  \n  I'm leaning towards using the **difference of squares** because it looks clean and straightforward. But expanding might also give me a clearer view to confirm. Let me try both and see which works better.\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Difference of Squares**\n\n**Attempting Strategy:**  \nUse the difference of squares formula:  \n\\[ a = (17 + 10), \\quad b = (17 - 10) \\]  \nSo, \\( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n1. **Find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):**  \n   \\[\n   a = 17 + 10 = 27  \n   b = 17 - 10 = 7  \n   \\]\n   \n2. **Compute \\( a - b \\) and \\( a + b \\):**  \n   \\[\n   a - b = 27 - 7 = 20  \n   a + b = 27 + 7 = 34  \n   \\]\n   \n3. **Apply the Difference of Squares Formula:**  \n   \\[\n   a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) = 20 \\times 34  \n   \\]\n   \n4. **Multiply:**  \n   \\[\n   20 \\times 34 = 680  \n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**  \n- **Quick Check:** Does \\( 20 \\times 34 \\) seem reasonable?  \n  \\[\n  20 \\times 30 + 20 \\times 4 = 600 + 80 = 680  \n  \\]  \n  Yes, that checks out.\n  \n- **Is This Correct?**  \n  It seems correct, but let's validate by expanding both terms to ensure nothing's amiss.\n\n### **Step 2: Expanding Both Terms to Verify**\n\n**Attempting Strategy:**  \nExpand \\( (17 + 10)^2 \\) and \\( (17 - 10)^2 \\) separately, then subtract the two.\n\n**Calculations:**  \n1. **Expand \\( (27)^2 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   27^2 = 729  \n   \\]\n   \n2. **Expand \\( (7)^2 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   7^2 = 49  \n   \\]\n   \n3. **Subtract the Two Results:**  \n   \\[\n   729 - 49 = 680  \n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**  \n- **Consistency Check:** Both methods yield the same result: \\( 680 \\).\n- **Final Thought:** This confirms that the **difference of squares** approach was correct. Expanding also led to the same answer, validating the initial method.\n\n### **Step 3: Re-evaluating the Difference of Squares Approach**\n\n**Thinking:**  \nEven though both methods gave the correct answer, I'm curious if I can simplify the process further.\n\n**Exploring Simplification:**  \nNotice that the expression is structured specifically to fit the difference of squares formula. Perhaps recognizing this pattern early on can save time.\n\n**Alternative Insight:**  \n- **Pattern Recognition:**  \n  Recognizing expressions like \\( (a + b)^2 - (a - b)^2 \\) immediately signals a difference of squares scenario.\n  \n- **Immediate Application:**  \n  This allows applying the formula without fully expanding, speeding up the solution.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Final Thought:**  \n- **Does \\( 680 \\) Make Sense?**  \n  Given the numbers involved, \\( 680 \\) seems reasonable. Both methods align, and the calculations are straightforward.\n  \n- **Possible Mistaken Insight:**  \n  Initially, I considered expanding both terms to verify. While this confirms correctness, leveraging the difference of squares formula directly was more efficient.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014first applying the **difference of squares** formula and then verifying by expanding both terms\u2014I confidently conclude that the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{680}\n\\]\n\nBy reflecting throughout the process and checking each step, I've ensured the accuracy and efficiency of the solution.",
