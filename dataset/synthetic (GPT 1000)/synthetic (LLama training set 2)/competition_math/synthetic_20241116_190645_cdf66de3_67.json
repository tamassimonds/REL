    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. First off, I need to really understand what's being asked. The question is about finding the probability of winning a lottery that involves two drawings: picking a MegaBall from 27 numbered balls and five WinnerBalls from 44 numbered balls. To win, I must correctly pick both the MegaBall and all five WinnerBalls, without needing the order of the WinnerBalls to be correct.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- This resembles probability problems I've seen before, particularly those involving multiple independent events.\n- It seems like I need to calculate the probabilities of each event happening and then combine them somehow.\n- Maybe using combinations would help since the order of WinnerBalls doesn't matter.\n- I'm also thinking about the total possible outcomes versus the successful outcomes.\n\nBut honestly, I'm a bit unsure where to start exactly. Let me brainstorm a bit more.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Calculate Each Probability Separately:**\n   - Find the probability of correctly picking the MegaBall.\n   - Find the probability of correctly picking the five WinnerBalls.\n\n2. **Combine the Probabilities:**\n   - Since these are independent events (correct MegaBall and correct WinnerBalls), maybe I can multiply their probabilities.\n\n3. **Use Combinations for WinnerBalls:**\n   - Since the order doesn't matter for WinnerBalls, combination formulas might be necessary.\n\n4. **Check Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   - Ensure that the total number of possible combinations is accounted for.\n\nHmm, combining the probabilities makes sense because winning requires both conditions to be met. But I need to ensure that I'm correctly calculating the probability for the WinnerBalls since order doesn't matter.\n\n**Step 1: Probability of Picking the Correct MegaBall**\n\nThoughts:\n- There are 27 numbered balls, and only one is the correct MegaBall.\n- So, the probability seems straightforward.\n\nCalculation:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{MegaBall}) = \\frac{1}{27}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, that makes sense. If there are 27 options and only one is correct, it's a simple probability.\n\n**Step 2: Probability of Picking the Correct Five WinnerBalls**\n\nThoughts:\n- There are 44 balls to choose from for the WinnerBalls.\n- I need to pick 5, and the order doesn't matter, so combinations are needed.\n- I need to find the probability of my specific set of five numbers being the winning set.\n\nCalculation:\n\n1. **Total Combinations for WinnerBalls:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total combinations} = \\binom{44}{5}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\binom{44}{5} = \\frac{44 \\times 43 \\times 42 \\times 41 \\times 40}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 1,086,008\n\\]\n\n2. **Probability of Picking the Correct Set:**\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{WinnerBalls}) = \\frac{1}{1,086,008}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait a minute! That number seems really large. Let me think about it. We're picking 5 out of 44, and there are many possible combinations. I suppose that makes sense. The probability is quite low, which aligns with lottery probabilities in general.\n\n**Step 3: Combining the Probabilities**\n\nThoughts:\n- Since the MegaBall and WinnerBalls are independent events, the overall probability of winning is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nCalculation:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Winning}) = P(\\text{MegaBall}) \\times P(\\text{WinnerBalls}) = \\frac{1}{27} \\times \\frac{1}{1,086,008} = \\frac{1}{29,322,216}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWow, that probability is incredibly low! 1 in over 29 million. It seems realistic for a lottery. A quick check: multiplying 27 and 1,086,008 gives 29,322,216, which seems correct. The logic behind multiplying probabilities for independent events also checks out.\n\n**Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\nThoughts:\n- Let me think if there's any step that could be wrong. Did I correctly use combinations for the WinnerBalls?\n- Is there anything I missed regarding the total number of possible outcomes?\n\nReflection:\nI think using combinations was the right approach since the order of WinnerBalls doesn't matter. Also, combining the probabilities of independent events is standard practice. I can't spot any mistakes in the calculations.\n\n**Step 5: Final Check**\n\nThoughts:\n- Before finalizing, let me verify the steps briefly. Does each part make logical sense?\n- Is the final probability reasonable considering typical lottery odds?\n\nReflection:\n- **MegaBall Probability:** Simple and correct.\n- **WinnerBalls Probability:** Correct use of combinations; large number but expected.\n- **Combined Probability:** Logical multiplication; outcome aligns with typical lottery probabilities.\n\nEverything seems to align. The approach feels correct, and the numbers check out.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe probability that the ticket I hold has the winning numbers is **\\(\\frac{1}{29,322,216}\\)**.\n\nThis detailed step-by-step process, including brainstorming, reflection, and verification, ensures that the approach is correct and the final answer is reliable.",

  "ground_truth": "The probability that the MegaBall matches is $\\dfrac{1}{27}$ . The probability that the 5 WinnerBalls match is $\\dfrac{1}{\\binom{44}{5}}$. So my chances of winning are $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{27}\\right)\\times\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\binom{44}{5}}\\right) = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{29,\\!322,\\!216}}$."
