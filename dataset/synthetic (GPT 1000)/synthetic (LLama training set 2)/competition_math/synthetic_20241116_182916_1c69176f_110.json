    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and make sure to check my work often. Let's get started by understanding the question thoroughly.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nHmm, the question involves rolling a fair 6-sided die. If the roll is even, I win that amount in dollars; if it's odd, I win nothing. So, I'm trying to find the **expected value** of my winnings.\n\n**Recalling Strategies:**\nI remember that expected value is essentially the average outcome if I were to repeat this process many times. I\u2019ve dealt with similar problems before where I had to consider weighted probabilities based on different outcomes.\n\n**Exploring Different Approaches:**\n1. **List All Possible Outcomes:** Calculate the probability and value for each die face.\n2. **Use Probability Distribution:** Apply the formula for expected value using probabilities.\n3. **Simulation Approach:** Though not practical here, simulating multiple rolls could provide an intuitive check.\n\n**Reflection:**\nI think listing all possible outcomes and calculating their probabilities individually makes the most sense for this problem. The simulation method might be overkill, and using a probability distribution seems straightforward.\n\n**Decision:**\nLet's go with **listing all possible outcomes** and calculating their expected values based on probabilities.\n\n### **Step 2: Listing Possible Outcomes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThere are six possible outcomes when rolling a 6-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Each outcome has an equal probability since the die is fair.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Probability of rolling any specific number: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, since we're dealing with even and odd rolls separately, I need to consider how the probabilities change based on whether the roll is even or odd.\n\n**Correction:**\nActually, the probability of rolling an even number is \\( \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\), and similarly for odd numbers. But since each individual number is still \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\), I can proceed with that.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Expected Value for Each Outcome**\n\n**Idea:**\nFor each die face:\n- If it's even (2, 4, 6), I win that amount in dollars.\n- If it's odd (1, 3, 5), I win nothing.\n\n**Detailed Calculation:**\nLet's list each outcome, its probability, and the corresponding winnings:\n\n| Die Face | Probability \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) | Winnings (Dollars) | Expected Value Contribution |\n|----------|-------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 1        | \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)             | 0                  | \\( 0 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 0 \\) |\n| 2        | \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)             | 2                  | \\( 2 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} \\) |\n| 3        | \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)             | 0                  | \\( 0 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 0 \\) |\n| 4        | \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)             | 4                  | \\( 4 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} \\) |\n| 5        | \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)             | 0                  | \\( 0 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 0 \\) |\n| 6        | \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)             | 6                  | \\( 6 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 1 \\) |\n\n**Reflection:**\nLet me quickly check if I've considered all outcomes correctly. Yes, each die face is accounted for, and the probabilities sum up to 1.\n\n**Mistake Check:**\nIs the total expected value correct? Let's add up the contributions:\n\n- From roll 1: \\( 0 \\)\n- From roll 2: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n- From roll 3: \\( 0 \\)\n- From roll 4: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- From roll 5: \\( 0 \\)\n- From roll 6: \\( 1 \\)\n\nTotal Expected Value: \\( 0 + \\frac{1}{3} + 0 + \\frac{2}{3} + 0 + 1 = \\frac{3}{3} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\)\n\n**Realization:**\nOh! The total expected value is **$2**. That seems reasonable considering the possible even rolls.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Check:** \nDoes this method make sense? By calculating the expected value contribution for each possible die face and summing them up, I should arrive at the correct expected value.\n\n**Possible Issues:**\n- Did I miss any outcomes? No, all six die faces are accounted for.\n- Is the probability assignment correct? Yes, each face has a \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) chance.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The approach of listing each outcome and calculating its expected value contribution is correct.\n\n### **Step 5: Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\nWhile the listing method worked well, I could also consider using a probability distribution approach or simplifying the calculation by focusing only on even rolls since odd rolls contribute nothing.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\nSince only even rolls contribute to the expected value, I could calculate the expected value conditional on rolling an even number.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Even numbers: 2, 4, 6\n- Total probability of rolling even: \\( \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n- Conditional expected value:\n\n\\[\nE[\\text{Winnings} | \\text{Even}] = \\frac{2 \\times \\frac{1}{6} + 4 \\times \\frac{1}{6} + 6 \\times \\frac{1}{6}}{\\frac{3}{6}} = \\frac{\\frac{12}{6}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, this approach gives an expected value of **$4**, which contradicts the earlier method. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\n**Mistake Check:**\nIn the conditional expected value calculation, I divided by the probability of rolling an even number, which is correct. But adding up the contributions:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6}, \\quad 4 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{6}, \\quad 6 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = \\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{4}{6} + 1 = \\frac{6}{6} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nE[\\text{Winnings} | \\text{Even}] = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Realization:**\nThe expected value based on conditional probability is **$4**, while the direct calculation method yielded **$2**. This discrepancy suggests that I need to reconsider the approaches.\n\n### **Step 6: Reconciling the Different Expected Values**\n\n**Reflection:**\nBoth methods are valid, but they seem to produce different results. This indicates a potential oversight in one of the approaches. Let's re-examine the listing method to ensure its correctness.\n\n**Possible Oversight:**\nIn the listing method, I considered each possible die face individually. However, perhaps I need to account for the fact that only even rolls contribute to the winnings, and odd rolls contribute nothing.\n\n**Revised Approach:**\nInstead of summing up all possible outcomes, let's focus only on the even outcomes and their probabilities.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Probability of rolling an even number: \\( \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n- Expected value considering only even rolls:\n\n\\[\nE[\\text{Winnings}] = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (2 + 4 + 6) \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = 2\n\\]\n\n**Mistake Check:**\nIs this consistent with our earlier result? Yes, this approach also yields an expected value of **$2**.\n\n**Realization:**\nThe discrepancy arose because the conditional expected value approach inadvertently considered the probability of rolling an even number twice. By focusing solely on the even outcomes and normalizing their probabilities, we align with the initial listing method's result.\n\n### **Step 7: Final Verification**\n\n**Check:**\nDoes the final expected value make sense? The expected value of **$2** indicates that, on average, rolling the die will yield a winning of **$2** over many trials.\n\n**Possible Issues:**\n- Did I correctly account for all possible outcomes? Yes, both even and odd rolls are considered.\n- Is the probability assignment consistent? Yes, each die face has a \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) chance, and even rolls are appropriately weighted.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nAfter reconciling the different approaches, the expected value of **$2** is indeed correct. The initial method was successful, and the conditional approach needed adjustments to align with it.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe expected value of your winnings when rolling a fair 6-sided die under these conditions is **$2**.\n\n---\n\nThis walkthrough showcases the brainstorming process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking for correctness, and reconciling differing results to arrive at the correct expected value.",
