    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start brainstorming to get a sense of how to approach it, reflecting often to ensure my strategies are on the right track, and checking my work to make sure everything aligns.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, it reminds me of dealing with linear equations\u2014specifically, finding the slope and y-intercept. The equation \\(y = ax + b\\) is the standard form of a linear equation, which makes me think about how to determine the coefficients \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) using given points on the line.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n1. **Use the Two Points to Find Slope and Intercept:**\n   - I recall that with two points, I can calculate the slope \\(a\\).\n   - Then, I can use one of the points to solve for \\(b\\).\n\n2. **Set Up a System of Equations:**\n   - Alternatively, I could set up two equations based on the given points and solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Check with Graphing:**\n   - Maybe sketching the line could help visualize, but that might not be precise for calculating \\(a - b\\).\n\nAt this point, using the two points to find the slope and intercept seems the most straightforward. But let's explore each option briefly to see which feels right.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Calculate slope \\(a\\) using the formula.\n- **Strategy 2:** Plug the slope into one of the point equations to find \\(b\\).\n- **Strategy 3:** Confirm by setting up a system of equations if needed.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Slope \\(a\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe slope \\(a\\) in the equation \\(y = ax + b\\) represents the change in \\(y\\) for a unit change in \\(x\\). I recall the formula for slope between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\):\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n\\]\n\n**Given Points:**\n- \\((4, 5)\\) \u2192 \\(x_1 = 4\\), \\(y_1 = 5\\)\n- \\((8, 17)\\) \u2192 \\(x_2 = 8\\), \\(y_2 = 17\\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{17 - 5}{8 - 4} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThat seems straightforward. Calculating \\(17 - 5\\) gives \\(12\\), and \\(8 - 4\\) is \\(4\\), so dividing them makes sense. The slope \\(a = 3\\) feels right because the \\(y\\) value increases by 12 when \\(x\\) increases by 4.\n\n### **Step 2: Find the Y-Intercept \\(b\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I have the slope \\(a = 3\\), I can use one of the given points to solve for \\(b\\). Let's use the point \\((4, 5)\\) for simplicity.\n\n**Using the Equation:**\n\n\\[\ny = ax + b\n\\]\n\nPlug in \\(x = 4\\) and \\(y = 5\\):\n\n\\[\n5 = 3(4) + b\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(b\\):**\n\n\\[\n5 = 12 + b\n\\]\n\\[\nb = 5 - 12 = -7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, \\(b = -7\\). This seems correct because when I subtract 12 from 5, I get \\(-7\\), which fits into the equation. \n\n### **Step 3: Verify the Second Point**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore moving on, it's worth checking if the second point \\((8, 17)\\) satisfies the equation \\(y = 3x - 7\\). This will confirm that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are correct.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nPlug \\(x = 8\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\ny = 3(8) - 7 = 24 - 7 = 17\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe calculated \\(y\\) value matches the given point \\((8, 17)\\). This serves as a good check that our slope and intercept are correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate \\(a - b\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe problem asks for \\(a - b\\). Now that I know \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = -7\\), this should be straightforward.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\na - b = 3 - (-7) = 3 + 7 = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nAdding 7 to 3 makes sense because subtracting a negative number is the same as adding. So, \\(a - b = 10\\).\n\n### **Step 5: Double-Check the Calculation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet me quickly double-check the subtraction and addition:\n\n\\[\n3 - (-7) = 3 + 7 = 10\n\\]\n\nYes, the arithmetic is correct.\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\nLooking back at each step:\n- **Calculating the slope** was straightforward and aligned with the formula.\n- **Finding \\(b\\)** by using one of the points confirmed the intercept.\n- **Verifying the second point** ensured that the equation was accurate.\n- **Calculating \\(a - b\\)** was a simple arithmetic step that checked out.\n\nEverything feels correct, and the approach was consistent throughout. \n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe value of \\(a - b\\) is **10**.",

  "ground_truth": "The slope of a line through two points, $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, is \\[\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.\\]Let $(x_1,y_1) = (4,5)$ and $(x_2,y_2) = (8,17)$. Then the slope of the line through the two points is \\[\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{17 - 5}{8 - 4} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3.\\]Thus, $a = 3$.\n\n$b$ satisfies $y = 3x + b$ for all points on its graph. Since $(4,5)$ lies on the the graph of $y = 3x + 5$, we can substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 5$ to solve for $b$. $5 = 3(4) + b$ and subtracting 12 from both sides yields $b = -7$. Therefore, $a - b = 3 - (-7) = \\boxed{10}$."
