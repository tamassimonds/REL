    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The sequence given is \\(243, 81, x, y, 3, \\ldots\\), and each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant. We need to find the value of \\(x + y\\).\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I recognize that this is a geometric sequence since each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor. This reminds me of problems where you have to identify the common ratio and use it to find missing terms.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Identify the Common Ratio (\\(r\\)):** Compute the ratio between successive terms.\n2. **Use Exponentiation:** Express each term as a power of the first term to see a pattern.\n3. **Set Up Equations:** Write equations based on the definition of geometric sequences.\n4. **Check for Errors:** Ensure calculations are correct at each step.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Common Ratio (\\(r\\))**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI know that in a geometric sequence, each term is the previous term multiplied by the common ratio \\(r\\). So, I can find \\(r\\) by dividing one term by the preceding term.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nr = \\frac{81}{243}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nLet me calculate this:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{81}{243} = \\frac{81 \\div 81}{243 \\div 81} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(r = \\frac{1}{3}\\). \n\n**Check:**\nWait, let me verify by reducing the fraction step by step to ensure there are no mistakes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{81}{243} = \\frac{3 \\times 27}{3 \\times 81} = \\frac{27}{81} = \\frac{1 \\times 27}{1 \\times 81} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis seems correct. The common ratio \\(r\\) is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n### **Step 2: Verify the Common Ratio with Another Pair of Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo ensure that \\(r\\) is consistent throughout the sequence, I'll check the ratio between the next pair of terms, \\(81\\) and \\(x\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nr = \\frac{x}{81}\n\\]\nGiven that \\(r = \\frac{1}{3}\\), we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{81} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(x\\):**\n\\[\nx = 81 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{81}{3} = 27\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis calculation seems straightforward. Multiplying \\(81\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) gives \\(27\\), which makes sense as \\(x\\).\n\n**Check:**\nQuick check: Does multiplying \\(27\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) give \\(81\\)? \n\n\\[\n27 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 9\n\\]\n\nOops, that can't be right. Let me backtrack. I think I misinterpreted the sequence direction. Let's re-examine.\n\n**Dead End:**\nWait, \\(27\\) times \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) does indeed equal \\(9\\), but that doesn't align with moving from \\(81\\) to \\(x\\). I might have misapplied the ratio direction.\n\n**Realization:**\nThe common ratio \\(r\\) applies to moving from one term to the next. Since \\(x\\) follows \\(81\\), the correct application should be:\n\n\\[\nx = 81 \\times r = 81 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 27\n\\]\n\nBut if I check \\(27 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 9\\), this doesn't fit. Let me reconsider.\n\n### **Step 3: Correcting the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nMaybe I misapplied the ratio. Let's approach it differently. Instead of assuming the common ratio applies directly, let's consider the full sequence and see where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) fit.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\nMaybe the common ratio scales down by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) each step, so perhaps starting from \\(243\\) down to \\(3\\), each step is a multiplication by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\nLet's compute the terms step by step:\n\n1. \\(243 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 81\\)\n2. \\(81 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 27\\)\n3. \\(27 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 9\\)\n4. \\(9 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 3\\)\n\n**Check:**\nLet me verify each multiplication:\n\n- \\(243 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 81\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(81 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 27\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(27 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 9\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(9 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 3\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis step-by-step multiplication makes sense and aligns with the given sequence. So, \\(x = 27\\) and \\(y = 9\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe corrected approach confirms that \\(x = 27\\) and \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate \\(x + y\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I have both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), I can simply add them together to find \\(x + y\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nx + y = 27 + 9 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nQuick check: Does adding \\(27\\) and \\(9\\) give \\(36\\)? \n\n\\[\n27 + 9 = 36\n\\]\nYes, that\u2019s correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe value of \\(x + y\\) is \\(36\\).\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n**Overall Process:**\nInitially, I attempted to apply the common ratio directly but realized there was a misapplication. By stepping back and verifying each part of the sequence, I corrected the approach and successfully identified \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n**Mistakes and Learning:**\nAt first, I mixed up the direction of applying the common ratio, thinking \\(x\\) was obtained by dividing \\(81\\) by \\(r\\), but it should be multiplying by \\(r\\). Recognizing this helped me adjust the strategy and arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**Final Check:**\nTo ensure everything is correct, I double-checked each multiplication step, confirming that applying the common ratio consistently leads to the correct terms.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\nx + y = 36\n\\]\n\nI hope this detailed step-by-step process helps in understanding how to approach and solve such geometric sequence problems!",
