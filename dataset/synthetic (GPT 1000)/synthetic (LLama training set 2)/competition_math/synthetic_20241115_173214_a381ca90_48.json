    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through it as naturally and reflectively as possible. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies, checking my work along the way, and adjusting my approach if something doesn\u2019t seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question:\n\n**What is the smallest integer \\( n \\), greater than \\( 1 \\), such that \\( n^{-1} \\pmod{1050} \\) is defined?**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** \n  - This reminds me of modular inverses, something I've dealt with in number theory before.\n  - I know that for an inverse to exist modulo some number, the integer and the modulus must be coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1).\n  - So, I need to find the smallest integer \\( n > 1 \\) for which \\( \\gcd(n, 1050) = 1 \\).\n\n- **Uncertainty:**\n  - Wait, but which integers less than 1050 are coprime to 1050? Do I need to list them out or is there a quicker way?\n  - Perhaps I can use the prime factorization of 1050 to make this easier.\n  - Hmm, maybe I can use the Euler's Totient Function to find out how many integers are coprime to 1050.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Prime Factorization:** Factor 1050 into its prime components and see which primes need to be avoided.\n  2. **Euler\u2019s Totient Function (\\( \\phi \\)):** Calculate \\( \\phi(1050) \\) to understand the distribution of coprime integers.\n  3. **List Smallest Coprime Integers:** Start listing integers greater than 1 and check if they are coprime to 1050.\n\n- **Possible Approaches:**\n  - **Approach 1:** Factor 1050 and identify primes.\n  - **Approach 2:** Compute \\( \\phi(1050) \\) to get insights about coprime integers.\n  - **Approach 3:** Manually check small integers greater than 1 until I find the smallest one coprime to 1050.\n\n**Given these reflections, I'll start with the Prime Factorization approach, as it seems foundational. If that doesn't lead me directly to the answer, I'll explore the other methods.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization of 1050**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Prime factorization will help me identify the building blocks of 1050.\n- Knowing the prime factors is crucial because, for \\( n \\) to be coprime with 1050, it must not share any prime factors with 1050.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's factorize 1050:\n\n\\[\n1050 = 10 \\times 105\n\\]\n\n\\[\n10 = 2 \\times 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n105 = 3 \\times 35\n\\]\n\n\\[\n35 = 5 \\times 7\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n1050 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Initial Check:** That seems correct because \\( 2 \\times 5^2 = 50 \\) and \\( 50 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 1050 \\).\n- **Realization:** This tells me that 1050 has the primes 2, 3, 5, and 7. Any integer \\( n \\) that is coprime to 1050 must not include these primes in its factorization.\n\n**Next Step:** Now that I know the prime factors, I can proceed to determine which integers greater than 1 are coprime to 1050 by avoiding these primes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Smallest Integer Greater Than 1 that is Copime to 1050**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I need to find the smallest integer \\( n > 1 \\) such that \\( \\gcd(n, 1050) = 1 \\).\n- Since 1050 has prime factors 2, 3, 5, and 7, \\( n \\) must not be divisible by any of these primes.\n- The smallest integers greater than 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on. I can check each of these to see if they share any prime factors with 1050.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Check \\( n = 2 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\gcd(2, 1050) = 2 \\quad (\\text{common factor is 2})\n  \\]\n  - **Reflection:** This can't be right because 2 is a prime factor of 1050.\n\n- **Check \\( n = 3 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\gcd(3, 1050) = 3 \\quad (\\text{common factor is 3})\n  \\]\n  - **Reflection:** Again, 3 is a prime factor of 1050.\n\n- **Check \\( n = 4 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\gcd(4, 1050) = 2 \\quad (\\text{common factor is 2})\n  \\]\n  - **Reflection:** 4 is divisible by 2, which is a factor of 1050.\n\n- **Check \\( n = 5 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\gcd(5, 1050) = 5 \\quad (\\text{common factor is 5})\n  \\]\n  - **Reflection:** 5 is directly a prime factor of 1050.\n\n- **Check \\( n = 6 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\gcd(6, 1050) = 6 \\quad (\\text{common factors are 2 and 3})\n  \\]\n  - **Reflection:** 6 is divisible by both 2 and 3, which are factors of 1050.\n\n- **Check \\( n = 7 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\gcd(7, 1050) = 7 \\quad (\\text{common factor is 7})\n  \\]\n  - **Reflection:** 7 is a prime factor of 1050.\n\n- **Check \\( n = 8 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\gcd(8, 1050) = 2 \\quad (\\text{common factor is 2})\n  \\]\n  - **Reflection:** 8 is divisible by 2.\n\n- **Check \\( n = 9 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\gcd(9, 1050) = 3 \\quad (\\text{common factor is 3})\n  \\]\n  - **Reflection:** 9 is divisible by 3.\n\n- **Check \\( n = 10 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\gcd(10, 1050) = 10 \\quad (\\text{common factors are 2 and 5})\n  \\]\n  - **Reflection:** 10 is divisible by both 2 and 5.\n\n- **Check \\( n = 11 \\):**\n  \\[\n  \\gcd(11, 1050) = 1 \\quad (\\text{no common factors})\n  \\]\n  - **Reflection:** Finally, 11 does not share any prime factors with 1050.\n\n**Mistake Noticed:**\n\n- **Realization:** At first, I started checking each integer one by one, which is time-consuming. Maybe there's a more systematic way, but for the sake of thoroughness, I'm continuing with this method.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n\n- **Possible Shortcut:** Instead of checking each integer individually, I could utilize Euler's Totient Function, but since I\u2019m already deep into checking, I\u2019ll proceed with this method for now.\n\n**Next Step:** Since \\( n = 11 \\) is the first integer greater than 1 that is coprime to 1050, I\u2019ll consider it as my candidate. However, let\u2019s do a quick verification using Euler's Totient Function to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying with Euler's Totient Function**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Euler's Totient Function, \\( \\phi(n) \\), gives the count of integers up to \\( n \\) that are coprime to \\( n \\).\n- By calculating \\( \\phi(1050) \\), I can confirm that there are multiple integers coprime to 1050, and 11 should be among them.\n- This step will serve as a check to ensure that my earlier approach was correct.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nThe formula for Euler's Totient Function for a number \\( n \\) with distinct prime factors \\( p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\phi(n) = n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_1}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_2}\\right) \\times \\cdots \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_k}\\right)\n\\]\n\nFor \\( n = 1050 \\) with prime factors 2, 3, 5, and 7:\n\n\\[\n\\phi(1050) = 1050 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{7}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 1050 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{6}{7}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 1050 \\times \\frac{48}{420}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 1050 \\times \\frac{24}{105} \n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 1050 \\times \\frac{8}{35} \n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 240 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** \\( \\phi(1050) = 240 \\), meaning there are 240 integers less than or equal to 1050 that are coprime to 1050.\n- **Connection:** Since I've already identified that 11 is coprime to 1050, and \\( \\phi(1050) \\) confirms that there are many such integers, it reinforces that my earlier finding is correct.\n\n**Next Step:** I\u2019ve confirmed that \\( n = 11 \\) is indeed the smallest integer greater than 1 for which \\( n^{-1} \\pmod{1050} \\) is defined. However, to be thorough, let's briefly consider another method to ensure consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Alternative Method - Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- The Chinese Remainder Theorem deals with systems of congruences and can provide insights into coprimality.\n- Although it's not directly necessary for this problem, exploring different strategies can validate the correctness of my current approach.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Idea:** If \\( n \\) is coprime to the modulus, it will leave distinct remainders when divided by each of the prime factors of the modulus.\n- **Applying CRT to 1050:** Since 1050 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7, and each prime is coprime to the others, any integer \\( n \\) that is coprime to each of these primes will also be coprime to 1050.\n\n**Application:**\n\n- We've established that \\( n = 11 \\) is coprime to all primes 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- Therefore, by CRT, \\( n^{-1} \\pmod{1050} \\) is well-defined.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** While CRT is more complex than needed for this problem, applying it confirms that \\( n = 11 \\) is valid.\n- **Realization:** It's always good to explore multiple strategies to ensure the robustness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Multiple Approaches:** By checking integers one by one and verifying with Euler's Totient Function, I've consistently identified \\( n = 11 \\) as the smallest integer greater than 1 that is coprime to 1050.\n- **No Mistakes Detected:** The calculations align, and alternative methods confirm the result.\n- **Confidence in Answer:** Even though the initial method was time-consuming, exploring different strategies ensured accuracy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Approach Validated:** Starting with prime factorization was effective in identifying the necessary conditions for coprimality.\n- **Importance of Checks:** Using Euler's Totient Function provided a numerical verification, reinforcing the correctness of the initial finding.\n- **Learning Point:** While checking each integer individually worked, employing more sophisticated methods like \\( \\phi(n) \\) can streamline the process, especially for larger moduli.\n- **Embracing Complexity:** It's okay to begin with a straightforward approach and incorporate advanced techniques as needed, ensuring a thorough understanding and verification of the solution.",

Conversely, if $n$ is relatively prime to $1050$, then $n$ has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.\n\nThe prime factors of $1050$ include $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$, so any multiple of any of these primes does not have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$. This rules out all the integers from $2$ to $10$. However, $11$ is relatively prime to $1050$, so $\\boxed{11}$ is the smallest integer greater than $1$ that has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$."
