I'll start by brainstorming how to approach it, checking my thoughts along the way, and adjusting strategies if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts**\n\n**User Request:**\nWhat is the nonnegative difference between the roots for the equation \\( x^2 + 30x + 180 = -36 \\)?\n\n**First Impressions:**\n- This looks like a quadratic equation, similar to others I've solved before.\n- I remember that finding roots often involves the quadratic formula, but there's a twist here with \\( = -36 \\).\n- Maybe I need to rearrange the equation to standard form first.\n- The term \"nonnegative difference\" is a bit specific\u2014does that mean I need to ensure the difference is positive?\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Quadratic Formula:** Use the standard formula for finding roots of quadratic equations.\n2. **Factoring:** See if the equation can be factored easily.\n3. **Completing the Square:** Another method I recall that might simplify the problem.\n4. **Graphical Approach:** Plotting the function to visually inspect the roots, but this may not be precise.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Quadratic formula is reliable, especially if factoring seems tricky at first glance.\n- Completing the square might bring additional insights, like the vertex form, which could be helpful.\n- Factoring could work if the equation simplifies nicely, but let's check that later.\n- Graphing might be overkill for a straightforward calculation.\n\n**Decision:**\nLet's start by rearranging the equation to standard form and then see if factoring is possible. If that doesn't work, I'll move to the quadratic formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Rearranging the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI need to bring all terms to one side to get the equation in standard quadratic form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n\n**Action:**\nAdd \\( 36 \\) to both sides to eliminate the negative on the right.\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 30x + 180 = -36 \\\\\nx^2 + 30x + 180 + 36 = 0 \\\\\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 30x + 216 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, now the equation is in standard form. This looks like a typical quadratic equation. Next, let's see if it can be factored.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting to Factor the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nFactoring a quadratic requires finding two numbers that multiply to the constant term (\\( 216 \\)) and add up to the linear coefficient (\\( 30 \\)). \n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Constant Term:** \\( 216 \\)\n- **Linear Coefficient:** \\( 30 \\)\n\nI need two numbers that:\n- Multiply: \\( m \\times n = 216 \\)\n- Add: \\( m + n = 30 \\)\n\n**Exploring Multiples of 216:**\nLet's list some pairs:\n\n\\[\n1 \\times 216 = 216 \\\\\n2 \\times 108 = 216 \\\\\n3 \\times 72 = 216 \\\\\n4 \\times 54 = 216 \\\\\n6 \\times 36 = 216 \\\\\n9 \\times 24 = 216 \\\\\n12 \\times 18 = 216 \\\\\n\\]\n\n**Checking Which Pair Adds Up to 30:**\nFrom the list above:\n- \\( 12 + 18 = 30 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, that actually works! The numbers **12** and **18** multiply to \\( 216 \\) and add up to \\( 30 \\). This seems promising.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Factoring the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf the factoring works out, I can write the equation as a product of two binomials.\n\n**Action:**\nGiven that \\( m = 12 \\) and \\( n = 18 \\), the equation factors to:\n\n\\[\n(x + 12)(x + 18) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nLet\u2019s double-check this factoring by expanding it back:\n\n\\[\n(x + 12)(x + 18) = x^2 + 18x + 12x + 216 = x^2 + 30x + 216\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nThis matches the rearranged equation, so the factoring is correct.\n\n**Realization:**\nThis is a neat solution! Factoring worked out nicely here, so no need for the quadratic formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Roots**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nWith the factored form, I can easily find the roots by setting each binomial to zero.\n\n**Action:**\nSet each factor to zero:\n\n\\[\nx + 12 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -12 \\\\\nx + 18 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -18\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, the roots are \\( -12 \\) and \\( -18 \\). Ideally, I'd want to check if these are correct before proceeding to find their difference.\n\n**Check:**\nLet\u2019s plug these roots back into the original equation to verify.\n\n\\[\n(-12)^2 + 30(-12) + 180 = -36 \\\\\n144 - 360 + 180 = -36 \\\\\n-36 = -36 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(-18)^2 + 30(-18) + 180 = -36 \\\\\n324 - 540 + 180 = -36 \\\\\n-36 = -36 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n\\]\n\n**Realization:**\nBoth roots satisfy the original equation, so they are correct. Factoring was the right approach here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Nonnegative Difference Between the Roots**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThe problem specifically asks for the **nonnegative difference**, which means the difference should be positive regardless of the order of the roots.\n\n**Action:**\nCalculate the difference between the roots:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = |-12 - (-18)| = |-12 + 18| = |6| = 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe difference is \\( 6 \\), and since it's nonnegative, it fits the requirement of the problem.\n\n**Check:**\nHmm, let me think\u2014does it make sense to take the absolute difference here? Since the problem asks for the nonnegative difference, taking the absolute value seems appropriate to ensure the difference is positive.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore concluding, let's ensure everything checks out\u2014did the factoring work? Are the roots correct? Is the difference calculated correctly?\n\n**Action:**\n- **Factoring Correctness:** Confirmed by expanding \\( (x + 12)(x + 18) = x^2 + 30x + 216 \\), which matches the rearranged equation.\n- **Roots Verification:** Both \\( x = -12 \\) and \\( x = -18 \\) satisfy the original equation.\n- **Difference Calculation:** \\( |-12 - (-18)| = 6 \\), which is nonnegative.\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything aligns perfectly. The factorization worked, the roots are verified, and the difference is correctly calculated.\n\n**Realization:**\nBy factoring, I streamlined the process and avoided potentially more complicated methods like the quadratic formula. It\u2019s always good to check if simpler strategies can work before moving on to more involved ones.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe nonnegative difference between the roots of the equation \\( x^2 + 30x + 180 = -36 \\) is **6**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- Starting with brainstorming helped in navigating through different strategies and confirming the most efficient path.\n- Factoring turned out to be a straightforward approach, saving time and reducing complexity.\n- Regular reflections and checks ensured that each step was correct, leading to a confident and accurate solution.",
