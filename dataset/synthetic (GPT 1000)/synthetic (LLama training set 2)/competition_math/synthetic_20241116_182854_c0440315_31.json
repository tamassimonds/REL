    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this probability problem step by step. I'll walk through my brainstorming process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking if my approach is correct. If something isn't working, I'll reconsider my method and adjust accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, I notice that there's a bag containing different colored jelly beans: 5 red, 6 green, 7 yellow, and 8 blue. The question asks for the probability of randomly selecting a blue jelly bean.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- The problem seems straightforward\u2014finding the probability of a specific event (selecting a blue jelly bean) out of a total possible events (selecting any jelly bean).\n- This reminds me of basic probability concepts where the probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n- However, I want to ensure I consider all possible strategies to confirm the most efficient approach.\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Basic Probability Formula**\n\n- **Thought:** The probability (P) of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. So, I should find the number of blue jelly beans over the total number of jelly beans.\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Blue}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of blue jelly beans}}{\\text{Total number of jelly beans}}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** This seems like the straightforward method. But let me double-check if there's anything more to consider, like ensuring all jelly beans are accounted for or whether the question has any hidden complexities.\n\n**Strategy 2: Total Count Verification**\n\n- **Thought:** Before applying the formula, it might be useful to verify the total number of jelly beans to ensure the probability calculation is accurate.\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total} = 5 (\\text{red}) + 6 (\\text{green}) + 7 (\\text{yellow}) + 8 (\\text{blue}) = 26\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Now I know the total number of jelly beans is 26, which makes the probability calculation straightforward. It also confirms there's no missing information.\n\n**Strategy 3: Alternative Probability Concepts**\n\n- **Thought:** I could also think about the probability in terms of percentages or fractions, but since the question asks for probability, sticking to the basic formula is most direct.\n  \n- **Reflection:** Considering percentages might complicate things unnecessarily since the probability formula is already clear. Let's stick with the basic probability formula.\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Basic Probability Formula**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nUsing Strategy 1:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Blue}) = \\frac{8}{26}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\\[\nP(\\text{Blue}) = \\frac{8 \\div 2}{26 \\div 2} = \\frac{4}{13}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait, let me check if simplifying makes sense here. Dividing both numerator and denominator by 2 is correct since 8 and 26 both have 2 as a common factor.\n- So, the simplified probability is \\(\\frac{4}{13}\\).\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach and Answer**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Thought:** Does \\(\\frac{4}{13}\\) seem reasonable? Let's see\u20144 out of 13 is less than half, which makes sense given there are more non-blue jelly beans (18) than blue ones (8).\n  \n- **Reflection:** This quick check aligns with my expectations. The probability is less than 1/2, which seems appropriate since there are more non-blue jelly beans.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**\n\n- **Thought:** Is there another method I should consider to confirm this answer? Perhaps calculating the probability of not picking a blue jelly bean and subtracting from 1?\n  \n- **Strategy 4: Probability of Complement**\n\n  - **Calculation:**\n    \\[\n    P(\\text{Not Blue}) = \\frac{18}{26} = \\frac{9}{13}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    P(\\text{Blue}) = 1 - P(\\text{Not Blue}) = 1 - \\frac{9}{13} = \\frac{4}{13}\n    \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** This alternative method confirms the original answer. It's always good to cross-verify using different strategies to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nAfter considering multiple strategies\u2014direct probability calculation, verifying total counts, and checking the complement probability\u2014I'm confident that the probability of selecting a blue jelly bean is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{4}{13}}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- Brainstorming helped me start with the most straightforward approach and then verify it using an alternative method.\n- Reflecting at each step ensured that my calculations were correct and that the logic made sense.\n- Checking the work multiple times, especially by using complementary probabilities, provided additional confidence in the final answer.\n\nBy thinking through it step by step, exploring different strategies, and constantly reflecting and verifying, I've arrived at the correct probability with a clear and thorough understanding of each part of the process.",
