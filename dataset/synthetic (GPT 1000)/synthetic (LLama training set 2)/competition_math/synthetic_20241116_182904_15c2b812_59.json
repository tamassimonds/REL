    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming and exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work as I go. Just like tackling any complex issue, I'll think out loud\u2014showing my thought process, including dead ends, corrections, and \"aha\" moments.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Understanding the Elements:** The points \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(R\\) are represented by complex numbers derived from a point \\(z\\) where \\(|z| = 1\\). That means \\(z\\) lies on the unit circle in the complex plane.\n  \n- **Creating a Parallelogram:** I need to find the fourth vertex \\(S\\) of the parallelogram \\(PQRS\\) when \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(R\\) are not collinear.\n\n- **Objective:** Determine the maximum distance between \\(S\\) and the origin.\n\nThis reminds me of problems involving geometric transformations in the complex plane. I\u2019ve dealt with parallelograms and properties of complex numbers before, but this adds the constraint of \\(|z| = 1\\).\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Utilizing Properties of Parallelograms:**\n   - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel.\n   - The diagonals bisect each other.\n\n   Maybe I can use these properties to find \\(S\\).\n\n2. **Exploring Vector Representation:**\n   - Representing \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) as vectors in the complex plane.\n   - Calculating the vectors to find \\(S\\).\n\n3. **Leveraging Polar Coordinates:**\n   - Since \\(|z| = 1\\), expressing \\(z\\) in polar form: \\(z = e^{i\\theta}\\).\n   - This might simplify the calculations.\n\n4. **Analyzing Collinearity and Parallelogram Properties:**\n   - Ensuring \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(R\\) are not collinear could lead to additional constraints.\n   \nI think starting with **Properties of Parallelograms** is a good initial approach. If that gets complicated, I can switch to vector representation or polar coordinates.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Parallelogram Properties**\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\(P = z\\)\n- \\(Q = (1 + i)z\\)\n- \\(R = 2\\overline{z}\\)\n\nGiven that \\(S\\) is the fourth vertex, I can use the fact that in a parallelogram:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Midpoint of } AC = \\text{Midpoint of } BD\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are the vertices. Translating this to our points:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P + R}{2} = \\frac{Q + S}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWait, so if the midpoints are equal, then:\n\n\\[\nP + R = Q + S \\implies S = P + R - Q\n\\]\n\nThis seems straightforward. Let\u2019s compute \\(S\\) using this formula.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nS = z + 2\\overline{z} - (1 + i)z\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nS = z + 2\\overline{z} - z - iz\n\\]\n\\[\nS = 2\\overline{z} - iz\n\\]\n\\[\nS = 2\\overline{z} - iz = z(2\\overline{z} - i)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, can I simplify this further? Maybe using \\(|z| = 1\\), so \\(\\overline{z} = \\frac{1}{z}\\). Let\u2019s see if that helps.\n\n**Substitution:**\n\n\\[\nS = z(2\\overline{z} - i) = z\\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{z} - i\\right) = 2 - iz\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression for \\(S\\) is \\(2 - iz\\).\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Distance from the Origin**\n\nNow, to find the maximum distance between \\(S\\) and the origin, we need \\(|S|\\):\n\n\\[\n|S| = |2 - iz|\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(|z| = 1\\), so \\(z = e^{i\\theta}\\), let\u2019s compute \\(|S|\\):\n\n\\[\n|S| = |2 - i e^{i\\theta}| = |2 - i(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)| = |2 - i\\cos\\theta + \\sin\\theta|\n\\]\n\nThis looks messy. Maybe another approach would be better. Let me think.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nI recall that maximizing \\(|a + bi|\\) involves squaring the terms, which might lead to a function of \\(\\theta\\) that can be maximized. But let\u2019s see if there's a simpler way.\n\n**Rewriting:**\n\n\\[\n|S| = |2 + \\sin\\theta - i\\cos\\theta|\n\\]\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to work with real and imaginary components separately. Let\u2019s see.\n\nBut no, I think keeping it in terms of \\(\\theta\\) might be better for seeing the maximum.\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Expression**\n\nLet\u2019s square the magnitude to avoid dealing with the square root:\n\n\\[\n|S|^2 = (2 + \\sin\\theta)^2 + (-\\cos\\theta)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n|S|^2 = (2 + \\sin\\theta)^2 + \\cos^2\\theta\n\\]\n\\[\n|S|^2 = 4 + 4\\sin\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta\n\\]\n\\[\n|S|^2 = 4 + 4\\sin\\theta + (\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta)\n\\]\n\\[\n|S|^2 = 4 + 4\\sin\\theta + 1 \\quad \\text{(since } \\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta = 1\\text{)}\n\\]\n\\[\n|S|^2 = 5 + 4\\sin\\theta\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so \\(|S|^2 = 5 + 4\\sin\\theta\\). To maximize \\(|S|\\), I need to maximize \\(\\sin\\theta\\), which varies between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\).\n\n\\(\\sin\\theta = 1\\) gives the maximum:\n\n\\[\n|S|^2 = 5 + 4(1) = 9 \\implies |S| = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me double-check. If \\(\\sin\\theta = 1\\), then \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), so:\n\n\\[\nz = e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{2}} = i\n\\]\n\\[\nS = 2 - i(i) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\\]\n\nThis makes sense. The maximum distance from the origin is indeed \\(3\\).\n\n### **Step 4: Ensuring Non-Collinearity**\n\nThe problem states that \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(R\\) are **not** collinear. Does this affect the maximum distance we've calculated?\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWait a minute. If \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(R\\) are collinear, then the points lie on the same line, which could potentially affect the shape of the parallelogram. However, the formula we derived for \\(S\\) still holds because the parallelogram properties ensure that \\(S\\) is defined based on the positions of \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(R\\).\n\nBut to be safe, let\u2019s consider an example where \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(R\\) are collinear and see if the maximum distance changes.\n\n**Example Check:**\n\nSuppose \\(|z| = 1\\) and \\(z = e^{i\\theta}\\).\n\n- \\(P = z\\)\n- \\(Q = (1 + i)z\\)\n- \\(R = 2\\overline{z} = 2\\frac{1}{z}\\)\n\nIf \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(R\\) are collinear, then \\(Q = kP + (1-k)R\\) for some scalar \\(k\\). This would imply that \\(S\\) would coincide with one of the points or lie along the same line, making the parallelogram degenerate.\n\nIn such a case, the maximum distance wouldn\u2019t be \\(3\\), but since the problem specifies that \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(R\\) are **not** collinear, we can safely conclude that our maximum distance of \\(3\\) remains valid.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThe non-collinearity condition ensures that the parallelogram is well-defined, and our calculations for \\(S\\) and its distance are correct.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, applying the properties of parallelograms, and verifying the conditions of non-collinearity, we've determined that the maximum distance between the fourth vertex \\(S\\) and the origin is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected often, checked each step, and ensured that the constraints of the problem were met. This approach led us to the correct solution while considering multiple perspectives and validating each step.",
