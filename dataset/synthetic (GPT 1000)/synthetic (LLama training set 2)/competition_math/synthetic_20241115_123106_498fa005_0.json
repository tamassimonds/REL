    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see where it takes me. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and adjust as needed. It's important to think out loud, check for correctness, and be ready to change approaches if something isn't making sense.\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem:\n\n$$(x^3 + 4x^2 - 7x + 11) + (-4x^4 - x^3 + x^2 + 7x + 3)$$\n\nI notice that **both expressions are polynomials** being added together. I remember from math classes that adding polynomials involves **combining like terms**\u2014terms that have the same variable raised to the same power.\n\nBut then I think, **\"Wait, there's a term with \\( x^4 \\) in the second polynomial. I don't see an \\( x^4 \\) term in the first polynomial. Does that mean I need to handle it differently?\"** This makes me consider that perhaps aligning the terms by their degrees (the exponent on \\( x \\)) would be helpful.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Aligning Like Terms:**\n   - Write both polynomials one under the other, aligning terms with the same degree.\n   - This seems straightforward and is a method I'm familiar with.\n\n2. **Combining Coefficients Sequentially:**\n   - Start from the highest degree and move downwards, adding coefficients step by step.\n   - This feels systematic and would ensure nothing is missed.\n\n3. **Using Distribution (though not typical for addition):**\n   - Maybe distribute each term, but I realize that's more for multiplication. Addition doesn't require this.\n\nAt this point, **combining like terms by aligning them seems the most direct approach**. Let's go with that.\n\n### **Step 1: Aligning the Polynomials by Degree**\n\nI'll write the polynomials one under the other, aligning terms with the same exponent:\n\n```\n    (x^3 + 4x^2 - 7x + 11)\n  + (-4x^4 - x^3 + x^2 + 7x + 3)\n```\n\nBut honestly, **this looks a bit messy**. Maybe I should write it out more neatly to avoid confusion. Let me try that again:\n\n```\n     x^3 +  4x^2 - 7x + 11\n  +  -4x^4 -  x^3 + 7x +  3\n  ----------------------------\n```\n\nNow it looks cleaner. **I can see that the highest degree term is \\( -4x^4 \\), so the result will have \\( x^4 \\) in it.** This reassures me that both polynomials contribute to the final answer.\n\n### **Step 2: Combining Like Terms**\n\nNow, I'll go through each column, starting from the highest degree down to the constant term.\n\n- **\\( x^4 \\) Terms:**\n  - Only one term: \\( -4x^4 \\)\n  - So, the result is **\\( -4x^4 \\)**.\n\n- **\\( x^3 \\) Terms:**\n  - \\( x^3 \\) from the first polynomial: \\( +1x^3 \\)\n  - \\( -x^3 \\) from the second polynomial: \\( -1x^3 \\)\n  - Combined: \\( 1x^3 - 1x^3 = 0 \\)\n  - **Wait,** that cancels out completely. So, **no \\( x^3 \\) term in the final answer**.\n\n- **\\( x^2 \\) Terms:**\n  - \\( 4x^2 \\) from the first polynomial\n  - \\( x^2 \\) from the second polynomial: \\( +1x^2 \\)\n  - Combined: \\( 4x^2 + 1x^2 = 5x^2 \\)\n  - So, **\\( 5x^2 \\)**.\n\n- **\\( x \\) Terms:**\n  - \\( -7x \\) from the first polynomial\n  - \\( 7x \\) from the second polynomial: \\( +7x \\)\n  - Combined: \\( -7x + 7x = 0 \\)\n  - **Again,** this cancels out. **No \\( x \\) term** in the final answer.\n\n- **Constant Terms:**\n  - \\( 11 \\) from the first polynomial\n  - \\( 3 \\) from the second polynomial\n  - Combined: \\( 11 + 3 = 14 \\)\n  - So, **\\( 14 \\)**.\n\n### **Step 3: Writing the Final Answer**\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n$$ -4x^4 + 5x^2 + 14 $$\n\n**Reflection:** \n\n- **Is this correct?** Let's quickly check:\n  - **\\( x^4 \\) term:** Only one \\( -4x^4 \\), matches.\n  - **\\( x^3 \\) term:** Cancelled out, no \\( x^3 \\) term, correct as per calculations.\n  - **\\( x^2 \\) term:** \\( 5x^2 \\), correct.\n  - **\\( x \\) term:** Cancelled out, no \\( x \\) term, correct.\n  - **Constant term:** \\( 14 \\), correct.\n\nEverything seems to check out. **I've successfully combined like terms and ordered the polynomial by decreasing degree.**\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Initial Strategy Worked:** Aligning the polynomials by degree and combining like terms was effective.\n- **Unexpected Cancelling:**  Noticing that both \\( x^3 \\) and \\( x \\) terms cancelled out was interesting. It simplified the final expression.\n- **Checking Is Important:** Reflecting and quickly checking each step ensured the correctness of the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n$$ -4x^4 + 5x^2 + 14 $$\n\nThis process shows how brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, and checking work can lead to a correct and neatly simplified polynomial.",
