I want to approach it just like how I would if I were solving it on paper, thinking out loud, brainstorming different strategies, and reflecting along the way to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question: **Compute \\(\\dbinom{7}{2}\\)**, my initial reaction is that it involves combinations, probably related to selecting items from a set without regard to the order.\n\n- **Familiarity:** This looks similar to problems involving choosing teams or selecting cards from a deck. I've worked with binomial coefficients before, so I remember there's a specific formula for combinations.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** But wait, I'm not 100% sure if I remember the formula correctly. Let me think about it. Is it the number of ways to choose 2 items from 7? That makes sense.\n\n- **Mixing Approaches:** I could either use the formula for combinations or perhaps list out the possible selections if 7 is a small enough number. Maybe there's another method I'm forgetting.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Combination Formula:**  \n   There's a standard formula for calculating \\(\\dbinom{n}{r}\\), which is \\(\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\\). I think \\(n = 7\\) and \\(r = 2\\) here.\n\n2. **List All Possible Combinations:**  \n   Since 7 is relatively small, I could try listing all the ways to pick 2 out of 7. This would give me a concrete idea if my formula approach is correct.\n\n3. **Use Pascal's Triangle:**  \n   Maybe I can recall that \\(\\dbinom{7}{2}\\) corresponds to a specific entry in Pascal's Triangle.\n\n4. **Check with a Simpler Example:**  \n   Perhaps testing a smaller binomial coefficient, like \\(\\dbinom{3}{2}\\), to see if my formula works before applying it to \\(\\dbinom{7}{2}\\).\n\nLet me start with the **Combination Formula** since it's the most straightforward. If that doesn't feel right, I'll explore the other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Combination Formula**\n\nGiven:  \n\\[\n\\dbinom{7}{2} = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nOkay, so I need to calculate factorials here. Let me recall that \\(n!\\) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \\(n\\).\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  \\[\n  7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  (7-2)! = 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n  \\]\n  \n- **Substituting Back:**  \n  \\[\n  \\dbinom{7}{2} = \\frac{5040}{2 \\times 120} = \\frac{5040}{240} = 21\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nHmm, 21 seems like a feasible number of combinations. But let me double-check the steps to ensure there are no calculation errors.\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  - \\(2 \\times 120 = 240\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - \\(5040 \\div 240 = 21\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out here. But just to be sure, let's try another approach to see if we arrive at the same answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Listing All Possible Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince 7 is small, I can list all possible ways to select 2 items from 7. This will not only verify my previous calculation but also give me a better intuitive understanding.\n\n- **Listing Combinations:**  \n  Let's label the items as A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Now, I'll list all pairs:\n\n  - (A, B)\n  - (A, C)\n  - (A, D)\n  - (A, E)\n  - (A, F)\n  - (A, G)\n  - (B, C)\n  - (B, D)\n  - (B, E)\n  - (B, F)\n  - (B, G)\n  - (C, D)\n  - (C, E)\n  - (C, F)\n  - (C, G)\n  - (D, E)\n  - (D, F)\n  - (D, G)\n  - (E, F)\n  - (E, G)\n  - (F, G)\n\n  **Total:** 21 combinations.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWow, this matches the result from the formula method! This gives me more confidence that the formula approach is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying with Pascal's Triangle**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI remember that binomial coefficients can be represented in Pascal's Triangle, where each entry is the sum of the two entries above it. Let me see if \\(\\dbinom{7}{2}\\) aligns with this.\n\n- **Pascal's Triangle Basics:**  \n  - The top row (row 0) is \\(n = 0\\).\n  - Each row corresponds to \\(n\\), starting from \\(n = 0\\).\n  - The number of elements in row \\(n\\) is \\(n + 1\\).\n  - The \\(r\\)-th entry in row \\(n\\) is \\(\\dbinom{n}{r}\\).\n\n- **Constructing Rows Up to \\(n = 7\\):**  \n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  \\text{Row 0:} & \\quad 1 \\\\\n  \\text{Row 1:} & \\quad 1 \\quad 1 \\\\\n  \\text{Row 2:} & \\quad 1 \\quad 2 \\quad 1 \\\\\n  \\text{Row 3:} & \\quad 1 \\quad 3 \\quad 3 \\quad 1 \\\\\n  \\text{Row 4:} & \\quad 1 \\quad 4 \\quad 6 \\quad 4 \\quad 1 \\\\\n  \\text{Row 5:} & \\quad 1 \\quad 5 \\quad 10 \\quad 10 \\quad 5 \\quad 1 \\\\\n  \\text{Row 6:} & \\quad 1 \\quad 6 \\quad 15 \\quad 20 \\quad 15 \\quad 6 \\quad 1 \\\\\n  \\text{Row 7:} & \\quad 1 \\quad 7 \\quad 21 \\quad 35 \\quad 21 \\quad 7 \\quad 1 \\\\\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n\n- **Observation:**  \n  In row 7, the 2nd entry (since we start counting from \\(r = 0\\)) is **21**.\n\n**Check:**  \nThis aligns perfectly with our previous calculations. It confirms that \\(\\dbinom{7}{2} = 21\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014applying the combination formula, listing all possible combinations, and verifying with Pascal's Triangle\u2014I confidently conclude that \\(\\dbinom{7}{2} = 21\\).\n\n**Mistakes and Learnings:**  \n- Initially, I wasn't completely sure about the combination formula, which led me to consider listing combinations.\n- Listing combinations provided a concrete verification, reinforcing the correctness of the formula.\n- Checking with Pascal's Triangle added another layer of confirmation, ensuring the answer is consistent across different methods.\n\n**Key Takeaway:**  \nUsing multiple approaches not only verifies the correctness of the solution but also deepens understanding. It's essential to reflect and check each step, adjusting strategies as needed to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration mimics a human thought process, complete with brainstorming, reflecting, and verifying at each stage.
