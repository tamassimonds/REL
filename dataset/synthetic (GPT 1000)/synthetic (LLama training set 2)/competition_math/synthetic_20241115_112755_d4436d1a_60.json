    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work to ensure each part makes sense. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so we're dealing with four distinct positive integers with a mean of 5, and the largest integer is 13. We need to find the smallest of these four integers.\n\n- **Mean of 5**: This tells me that the average of the four integers is 5. That\u2019s a crucial piece of information because it relates the sum of the integers to their count.\n  \n- **Largest Integer is 13**: Knowing the largest helps in determining the possible values of the other integers, especially since they must be distinct and positive.\n\n- **Distinct Positive Integers**: This means no two integers can be the same, and all must be greater than zero.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Total Sum Calculation**: Since the mean is 5 and there are four integers, their total sum must be \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\).\n  \n- **Using the Largest Integer**: We know one integer is 13. Maybe I can subtract 13 from 20 to find the sum of the other three integers.\n\n- **Finding the Smallest Integer**: After determining the possible values of the other three, the smallest one among them should be identified.\n\n**Initial Idea:**\n\n- Calculate the total sum based on the mean.\n- Subtract the largest integer from this sum to find the sum of the remaining three.\n- Determine the smallest integer among the three remaining.\n\n**But Wait...**\n\nIs this approach straightforward? Let me think. Subtracting 13 from 20 gives me 7, which needs to be distributed among three distinct integers. I need to ensure these integers are all greater than zero and distinct. \n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems like a valid starting point, but I need to ensure that the distribution of 7 among three distinct positive integers is feasible. Let's proceed and see if it aligns.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Calculating the Sum of the Three Remaining Integers**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nTotal sum of the four integers:  \n\\[ 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\]\n\nSum of the three remaining integers (excluding the largest, 13):  \n\\[ 20 - 13 = 7 \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes it make sense to split 7 among three distinct positive integers?  \n- Yes, but each integer must be at least 1. Let's see if it's possible to have three integers sum up to 7 while being distinct and greater than zero.\n\n**Quick Insight:**\n\nIf each of the three integers must be at least 1, the minimum total would be \\(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\\). Since 7 is greater than 6, it's possible to have distinct integers summing to 7. This aligns well.\n\n**Next Thought:**\n\nGreat! Now, I need to find three distinct integers that add up to 7. Maybe starting with the smallest possible integers and adjusting would work.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Finding Three Distinct Positive Integers That Sum to 7**\n\n**Attempting Different Combinations:**\n\n1. **Combination 1:**  \n   - Let\u2019s start with \\(1, 2, and 3\\).  \n   - Sum: \\(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\\)  \n   - **Reflection:** Wait, the sum is only 6, but we need it to be 7. So, this doesn't work.\n\n2. **Combination 2:**  \n   - Increase one of the numbers. Let's try \\(1, 2, and 4\\).  \n   - Sum: \\(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\\)  \n   - **Check:** Perfect! This adds up to 7.\n\n3. **Combination 3:**  \n   - Let\u2019s see if there's another combination. Perhaps \\(1, 3, and 3\\).  \n   - **Observation:** But this doesn't work because the integers need to be distinct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe only feasible combination that meets all criteria is \\(1, 2,\\) and \\(4\\). \n\n**But...**\n\nIs there a way to have multiple combinations adding to 7 while being distinct?  \n- Given the constraint of distinct positive integers, larger numbers quickly exceed the sum of 7. So, \\(1, 2,\\) and \\(4\\) seem to be the only viable option.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\nAlright, \\(1, 2,\\) and \\(4\\) are the three integers that, along with 13, sum up to 20. Now, to find the smallest integer among them.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Identifying the Smallest Integer**\n\n**List of Integers:**\n\nWe have:  \n- Smallest: \\(1\\)\n- Next: \\(2\\)\n- Next: \\(4\\)\n- Largest: \\(13\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe smallest integer among \\(1, 2, 4,\\) and \\(13\\) is clearly **1**.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense?  \n- Yes, all integers are distinct and positive.\n- They sum correctly: \\(1 + 2 + 4 + 13 = 20\\).\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\nLet\u2019s quickly add them up:  \n\\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 13 = 20 \\]  \n- Matches the required total sum.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Final Thoughts and Confirmation**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Total Sum Required:** 20\n- **Largest Integer Given:** 13\n- **Sum of Remaining Integers:** 7\n- **Three Distinct Integers Adding to 7:** 1, 2, and 4\n- **Smallest Integer Among Them:** 1\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe approach seems correct. By systematically finding three distinct integers that sum up to 7, and ensuring all conditions are met (distinct, positive, and summing correctly), I've arrived at the smallest integer being **1**.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- Does the total sum add up? \\(1 + 2 + 4 + 13 = 20\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- Are all integers distinct and positive? \u2714\ufe0f\n- Does the mean calculate correctly? \\(20 \u00f7 4 = 5\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out! The smallest integer is indeed **1**.\n\n**Mistake or Realization:**\n\nAt first, I almost considered other combinations like \\(1, 2, 3\\), but realizing the sum needed to be 7 led me to increase the numbers slightly, which worked perfectly.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\nApproaching the problem step-by-step, checking each part, and being open to adjusting strategies helped in arriving at the correct solution confidently.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe smallest of the four distinct positive integers is **1**.",
