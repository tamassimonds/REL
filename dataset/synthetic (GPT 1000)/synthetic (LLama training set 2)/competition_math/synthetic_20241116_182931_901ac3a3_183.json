    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just as I would if tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their validity, and check my work often to ensure I'm on the right track. Here\u2019s how I would start thinking about it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so James has a total of **$66** in his piggy bank. He's got only **one-dollar bills** and **two-dollar bills**. Moreover, there are a total of **49 bills** in the piggy bank. The goal is to find out how many **one-dollar bills** he has.\n\n**Initial Reflection:**\n- **Total Amount:** $66\n- **Total Bills:** 49\n- **Types of Bills:** $1 and $2\n\nMy first instinct is that this seems like a **system of equations** problem, but I'm not entirely sure yet. Alternatively, it reminds me of problems where you set up **ratios or proportions**. Maybe there\u2019s another method I\u2019m not seeing right now.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **System of Equations:**  \n   - Set up two equations based on the total number of bills and the total amount.\n   \n2. **Substitution Method:**  \n   - Solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other.\n\n3. **Elimination Method:**  \n   - Add or subtract equations to eliminate one variable.\n\n4. **Guess and Check:**  \n   - Make educated guesses and adjust based on the total.\n\n5. **Integer Constraints:**  \n   - Since bills are whole numbers, maybe calculate possible combinations.\n\nLet\u2019s explore these options to see which might be the best approach.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis seems structured and should work, assuming I set it up correctly. I'll try it and see if it leads to a logical solution.\n\n**Step 1:**  \nDefine Variables:  \n- Let \\( x \\) = number of one-dollar bills  \n- Let \\( y \\) = number of two-dollar bills  \n\n**Step 2:**  \nSet Up Equations Based on the Problem:  \n1. Total number of bills:  \n   \\[ x + y = 49 \\]  \n   \n2. Total amount in dollars:  \n   \\[ 1x + 2y = 66 \\]  \n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense?  \n- The first equation accounts for the total number of bills.  \n- The second equation accounts for the total dollar amount.  \n\nSeems logical so far.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Substitution Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second. This should help in finding the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n**Step 3:**  \nSolve Equation 1 for \\( y \\):  \n\\[ y = 49 - x \\]  \n\n**Step 4:**  \nSubstitute \\( y \\) into Equation 2:  \n\\[ x + 2(49 - x) = 66 \\]  \n\\[ x + 98 - 2x = 66 \\]  \n\\[ -x + 98 = 66 \\]  \n\\[ -x = 66 - 98 \\]  \n\\[ -x = -32 \\]  \n\\[ x = 32 \\]  \n\n**Step 5:**  \nFind \\( y \\) using Equation 1:  \n\\[ y = 49 - 32 = 17 \\]  \n\n**Check:**  \n- \\( x = 32 \\) (one-dollar bills)  \n- \\( y = 17 \\) (two-dollar bills)  \n\nDoes this satisfy both original equations?\n\n### **Reflection: Quick Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s verify these numbers against the original conditions.\n\n**Check Total Number of Bills:**  \n\\[ 32 + 17 = 49 \\]  \n\u2705 Matches the total number of bills.\n\n**Check Total Amount in Dollars:**  \n\\[ (32 \\times 1) + (17 \\times 2) = 32 + 34 = 66 \\]  \n\u2705 Matches the total amount.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth conditions are satisfied. This suggests that the solution is correct.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Guess and Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThough the substitution method worked, let's see if a guess-and-check approach would also lead to the same solution as a sanity check.\n\n**Step 6:**  \nMake an educated guess for \\( x \\):\n\nSuppose \\( x = 30 \\):  \n- Total bills would be \\( 49 - 30 = 19 \\).  \n- Total amount would be \\( 30 \\times 1 + 19 \\times 2 = 30 + 38 = 68 \\).  \n  \n**Observation:**  \nWait, the total amount is **$68**, which is **$2 more** than $66. This suggests that \\( x = 30 \\) is too low.\n\n**Step 7:**  \nAdjust the guess:\n\nTry \\( x = 31 \\):  \n- \\( y = 49 - 31 = 18 \\)  \n- Total amount: \\( 31 \\times 1 + 18 \\times 2 = 31 + 36 = 67 \\)  \n  \n**Observation:**  \nStill **$1 more** than $66. So \\( x = 31 \\) is also too low.\n\n**Step 8:**  \nContinue adjusting:\n\nTry \\( x = 32 \\):  \n- \\( y = 49 - 32 = 17 \\)  \n- Total amount: \\( 32 \\times 1 + 17 \\times 2 = 32 + 34 = 66 \\)  \n  \n**Check:**  \nThis matches the total amount! So, \\( x = 32 \\) is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGuess and check took longer, but it aligns with the substitution method. This approach confirms the solution.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 4: Integer Constraints**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must be whole numbers (you can't have a fraction of a bill), maybe considering only feasible integer combinations could simplify things.\n\n**Step 9:**  \nStart with Maximum Possible \\( y \\):\n\nIf all bills were two-dollar bills:  \n\\[ 49 \\times 2 = 98 \\] (but we only have $66)  \nSo, clearly, not all can be two-dollar bills.\n\n**Step 10:**  \nReduce \\( y \\) and Calculate Corresponding \\( x \\):\n\nLet\u2019s decrease \\( y \\) by 1 and see how \\( x \\) adjusts:\n\n- If \\( y = 17 \\):  \n  \\[ 2(17) = 34 \\]  \n  \\[ 66 - 34 = 32 \\] (so \\( x = 32 \\))  \n\n- If \\( y = 16 \\):  \n  \\[ 2(16) = 32 \\]  \n  \\[ 66 - 32 = 34 \\] (so \\( x = 34 \\))  \n\n**Check:**  \nDoes \\( x + y = 49 \\) in both cases?\n\n- For \\( y = 17 \\):  \n  \\[ 32 + 17 = 49 \\] \u2714\ufe0f  \n\n- For \\( y = 16 \\):  \n  \\[ 34 + 16 = 50 \\] \u2716\ufe0f (exceeds total bills)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOnly \\( y = 17 \\) and \\( x = 32 \\) satisfy both conditions. This reinforces our earlier solutions.\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s ensure that all strategies lead to the same answer and that everything checks out.\n\n**Check Total Number of Bills:**  \n\\[ x + y = 32 + 17 = 49 \\] \u2714\ufe0f  \n\n**Check Total Amount in Dollars:**  \n\\[ 1(32) + 2(17) = 32 + 34 = 66 \\] \u2714\ufe0f  \n\n**Consistency Among Strategies:**  \nAll approaches\u2014substitution, guess and check, and integer constraints\u2014consistently point to:\n\n- \\( x = 32 \\) (one-dollar bills)  \n- \\( y = 17 \\) (two-dollar bills)  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe solution is robust. Multiple methods converge to the same answer, validating its correctness.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nJames has **32 one-dollar bills** in his piggy bank.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstormed several strategies:** System of equations, guess and check, and considering integer constraints.\n- **Explored the substitution method:** Successfully solved for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), aligning with the total number of bills and the total amount.\n- **Used guess and check as a sanity check:** Confirmed the solution by adjusting initial guesses.\n- **Applied integer constraints:** Ensured only feasible combinations of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) worked.\n- **Verified through multiple checks:** Consistency across different methods confirmed the correctness.\n\nThis step-by-step approach\u2014reflecting regularly, checking work, and being open to adjusting strategies\u2014ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Call the number of one dollar bills $x$ and the number of two dollar bills $y$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 49, \\\\\n1x + 2y &= 66. \\\\\n\\end{align*}The first equation represents the total number of dollar bills in the piggy bank, and the second equation represents how much money is in the piggy bank. Solving for $x$ in the first equation gives $x = 49 - y$. Substituting for $x$ in the second equation yields $49 - y + 2y = 66$, or $y = 17$. But $y$ is the number of two dollar bills, and the question asks for the number of one dollar bills, so solve for $x$: $x = 49 - 17$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{32}$ one dollar bills."
