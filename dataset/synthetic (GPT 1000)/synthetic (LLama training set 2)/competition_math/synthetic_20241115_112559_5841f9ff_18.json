    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. When I first look at it, I see a 2x2 determinant:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix} \n0 & 1 \\\\ \n3 & 5 \n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Familiarity:** This reminds me of calculating determinants for small matrices. I recall there\u2019s a specific formula for 2x2 determinants that involves multiplying the diagonal elements and subtracting the product of the off-diagonal elements. \n- **Brainstorming Strategies:** Maybe I could use the formula directly. Alternatively, I could expand it using cofactor expansion, but that feels a bit overkill for a 2x2 matrix. There's also the method of row operations to simplify the matrix before calculating the determinant.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Direct Formula for 2x2 Determinants:**\n   - Recall the formula: For a matrix \n     \\[\n     \\begin{pmatrix} \n     a & b \\\\ \n     c & d \n     \\end{pmatrix}\n     \\]\n     the determinant is \\( ad - bc \\).\n   \n   - Applying this to our matrix:\n     - \\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), \\( c = 3 \\), \\( d = 5 \\)\n     - So, the determinant \\( = (0 \\times 5) - (1 \\times 3) = 0 - 3 = -3 \\).\n\n2. **Cofactor Expansion:**\n   - Although cofactor expansion is more commonly used for larger matrices, it's still applicable here. But reflecting on its complexity compared to the direct formula, I think it might be unnecessary.\n   \n   - If I were to apply it:\n     - For the first row, the determinant would be:\n       \\[\n       0 \\times \\begin{vmatrix} 5 \\end{vmatrix} - 1 \\times \\begin{vmatrix} 3 \\end{vmatrix} = 0 - 3 = -3\n       \\]\n   \n   - Wait, this gives the same result. Maybe that's a good check that the direct formula is correct.\n\n3. **Row Operations:**\n   - Another method is to simplify the matrix using row operations to make it easier to calculate the determinant. However, given that our matrix is already quite simple, this might complicate things unnecessarily.\n   \n   - Thinking about it, row operations are usually more beneficial for larger matrices or when dealing with more complex determinants.\n\n**Selecting the Best Approach:**\n\n- Given that the direct formula for 2x2 determinants is straightforward and I've confirmed its validity with cofactor expansion, I'll proceed with this method.\n- **Wait**, before finalizing, let me double-check the formula: For a 2x2 matrix, it's indeed \\( ad - bc \\). That aligns with what I've done.\n\n**Calculating the Determinant:**\n\n- Using the direct formula:\n  \\[\n  \\det = (0 \\times 5) - (1 \\times 3) = 0 - 3 = -3\n  \\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** The determinant is -3. Since both components involve multiplication with zero and one, the calculations seem straightforward.\n- **Reflection:** Does this make sense? A determinant of -3 indicates that the matrix represents a transformation that reverses orientation and scales the area by a factor of 3. That feels consistent given the matrix's structure.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Reassurance:** Even though the cofactor expansion method also led to -3, the direct formula was much quicker and easier to apply. This reassures me that the approach was correct.\n- **Conclusion:** The determinant of the given matrix is \\(\\boxed{-3}\\).\n\n**Wrapping Up:**\n\n- **Engaging with the Process:** Initially, I considered multiple strategies\u2014direct formula, cofactor expansion, and row operations. The direct formula proved to be the most efficient.\n- **Realizations:** At first, I thought about expanding using cofactors, but recognizing its unnecessary complexity for a 2x2 matrix helped me streamline the process.\n- **Final Check:** Throughout, I ensured each step logically followed the previous one and confirmed that the methods aligned with the expected outcomes.\n\nThanks for walking through this problem with me. By brainstorming different strategies and reflecting on their appropriateness, I was able to determine the determinant confidently.",
