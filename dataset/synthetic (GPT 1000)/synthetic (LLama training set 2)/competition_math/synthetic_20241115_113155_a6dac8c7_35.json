    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just as I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, reflect often, and check my work regularly to ensure I'm on the right path. Let's begin by truly understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so Enrico is making a list of the first twenty positive multiples of 3. Marie is making a list of the first ten positive multiples of 6. The question asks how many numbers from Marie's list are also on Enrico's list.\n\nAt first glance, this seems like a problem involving multiples and perhaps common multiples. I remember dealing with least common multiples (LCM) and greatest common divisors (GCD) back when I was in school. Maybe I can leverage that here.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Option 1:** List out both Enrico's and Marie's numbers and see which ones overlap.\n- **Option 2:** Use concepts of LCM to find common multiples of 3 and 6.\n- **Option 3:** Think about the relationship between multiples of 3 and multiples of 6.\n\nHmm, listing them seems straightforward but might be tedious. Using LCM could simplify things. I should probably explore both listing and LCM strategies to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring the Listing Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's start by explicitly listing both Enrico's and Marie's multiples. This will give me a clear picture and help identify any overlaps.\n\n**Action: List Enrico's and Marie's Multiples**\n\n- **Enrico\u2019s List (Multiples of 3):**\n  - 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n  - 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n  - 3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n  - 3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n  - 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n  - 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n  - 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n  - 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n  - 3 \u00d7 9 = 27\n  - 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n  - 3 \u00d7 11 = 33\n  - 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n  - 3 \u00d7 13 = 39\n  - 3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n  - 3 \u00d7 15 = 45\n  - 3 \u00d7 16 = 48\n  - 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\n  - 3 \u00d7 18 = 54\n  - 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n  - 3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n\nWait, let me double-check - that's indeed the first twenty multiples of 3.\n\n- **Marie\u2019s List (Multiples of 6):**\n  - 6 \u00d7 1 = 6\n  - 6 \u00d7 2 = 12\n  - 6 \u00d7 3 = 18\n  - 6 \u00d7 4 = 24\n  - 6 \u00d7 5 = 30\n  - 6 \u00d7 6 = 36\n  - 6 \u00d7 7 = 42\n  - 6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n  - 6 \u00d7 9 = 54\n  - 6 \u00d7 10 = 60\n\nAgain, checking - that's the first ten multiples of 6.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow, looking at both lists, I can see some numbers appear in both. This suggests that Marie's list has common multiples with Enrico's list. But I want to make sure there's an efficient way to identify these without relying solely on listing.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering the LCM Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nListing works, but might not be the most efficient for larger numbers. Maybe using the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 6 could help identify common multiples more systematically.\n\nBut wait, since 6 is already a multiple of 3, perhaps all multiples of 6 are also multiples of 3. This makes me think that Marie's list is a subset of Enrico's list.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Option 1:** Calculate LCM(3, 6) to find common multiples.\n- **Option 2:** Recognize that all of Marie's multiples are also Enrico's.\n\nHmm, I think recognizing that Marie's multiples are also Enrico's is a key insight. Maybe I don't even need to calculate LCM explicitly.\n\n**Action: Visualize the Relationship**\n\n- **Multiples of 3:** 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60\n- **Multiples of 6:** 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60\n\n**Checking:**\n\nLet me quickly spot the overlaps:\n- 6\n- 12\n- 18\n- 24\n- 30\n- 36\n- 42\n- 48\n- 54\n- 60\n\nAll these numbers appear in both lists. This confirms my earlier thought - all multiples of 6 up to 60 are also multiples of 3.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, every number in Marie's list is also in Enrico's list. This realization makes the problem much simpler.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Validating the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure my approach is correct, let's consider why this happens. If Marie's list consists of multiples of 6, and Enrico's list consists of multiples of 3, then naturally, all multiples of 6 are also multiples of 3.\n\nThis is because 6 is itself a multiple of 3 (6 = 3 \u00d7 2), so any multiple of 6 is also a multiple of 3.\n\n**Action: Verify with a Different Strategy**\n\nJust to be sure, let me use another method. Perhaps I can check if all numbers in Marie's list are also in Enrico's list by considering their factors.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**\n\n- **Marie\u2019s Multiples:** 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60\n- **Checking Factors:** Each of these numbers is divisible by 3.\n\nFor example:\n- 6 \u00f7 3 = 2\n- 12 \u00f7 3 = 4\n- 18 \u00f7 3 = 6\n- ...\n\n**Checking:**\n\nThis confirms that all numbers in Marie's list are indeed multiples of 3.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth strategies lead to the same conclusion: all of Marie's numbers are also in Enrico's list. This consistency gives me confidence that the approach is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Count**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I've established that all of Marie's numbers are in Enrico's list, the next step is to count how many numbers are in Marie's list.\n\n**Action: Count Marie's Multiples**\n\nLet's list Marie's multiples again for clarity:\n\n- 6\n- 12\n- 18\n- 24\n- 30\n- 36\n- 42\n- 48\n- 54\n- 60\n\n**Counting:**\n\nThere are **10** numbers in Marie's list.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAh, this aligns perfectly with the number of multiples she's considering (the first ten multiples of 6). So, the answer is indeed **10**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's do a quick check:\n\n- Are all of Marie's numbers also in Enrico's list? Yes, as confirmed earlier.\n- Is the count accurate? Counting each number in Marie's list gives 10.\n- Does this make sense considering the problem's constraints? Absolutely, since she's listing the first ten multiples of 6.\n\n**Action: Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n**10** of the numbers on Marie's list are also on Enrico's list.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThroughout this problem, exploring different strategies\u2014listing, recognizing relationships between multiples, and verifying with alternative methods\u2014helped solidify the correct approach. Reflecting and checking the work at each stage ensured accuracy, leading to the final answer confidently.\n\nBy thinking through it step-by-step, just like I would naturally approach a problem, I've arrived at the solution: **10**.",

  "ground_truth": "Enrico's list includes all the multiples of 3 from $1 \\cdot 3 = 3$ through $20 \\cdot 3 = 60$. Marie's list includes all the multiples of 6 from $1 \\cdot 6 = 6$ through $10 \\cdot 6 = 60$. Since 6 is a multiple of 3, any multiple of 6 is also a multiple of 3. All of the numbers on Marie's list are multiples of 3 within the range of Enrico's list, so all $\\boxed{10}$ numbers on Marie's list are also on Enrico's list."
