Let's dive into factoring \\(9y^2 - 30y + 25\\) by brainstorming different strategies, exploring each step thoroughly, checking our work, and reflecting frequently\u2014as if we're thinking through it as humans naturally would.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen I first see the expression \\(9y^2 - 30y + 25\\), a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Recognizing Perfect Squares:** The coefficients \\(9\\) and \\(25\\) are perfect squares, which makes me wonder if this trinomial might be a perfect square itself.\n   \n2. **Standard Quadratic Factorization:** I remember the standard form of a quadratic equation is \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\), and I could attempt factoring it like that by finding two numbers that multiply to \\(ac\\) and add to \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** If factoring doesn't work easily, I could use the quadratic formula to find the roots, then express the quadratic in its factored form.\n\n4. **Completing the Square:** Another method is completing the square, which might reveal its factored form directly.\n\nHonestly, the first thing that strikes me is the possibility of it being a **perfect square trinomial** because the leading coefficient and the constant term are both perfect squares. But, I'm not entirely sure yet, so I'll explore that idea first and see if it holds.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Perfect Square Trinomial Idea**\n\n**Reflection:**  \n perfect square trinomial takes the form \\( (a - b)^2 \\) or \\( (a + b)^2 \\), which expands to:\n- \\(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\) for the minus version\n- \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\) for the plus version\n\nGiven \\(9y^2\\) and \\(25\\) are \\( (3y)^2 \\) and \\(5^2\\) respectively, I wonder if this matches the structure of a perfect square trinomial.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- If it\u2019s a perfect square, the middle term should be \\( \\pm 2ab \\) where \\(a = 3y\\) and \\(b = 5\\).\n- Calculate \\(2ab = 2 \\times 3y \\times 5 = 30y\\).\n- The given middle term is \\(-30y\\), so it matches with \\( (a - b)^2 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Proposed Factored Form: \\( (3y - 5)^2 \\).\n- Let's expand \\( (3y - 5)^2 \\) to verify:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(3y - 5)^2 & = (3y - 5)(3y - 5) \\\\\n            & = 3y \\times 3y + 3y \\times (-5) + (-5) \\times 3y + (-5) \\times (-5) \\\\\n            & = 9y^2 - 15y - 15y + 25 \\\\\n            & = 9y^2 - 30y + 25\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThis matches the original expression exactly! So, my initial thought about it being a perfect square trinomial was correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nPerfect square trinomial! The original expression is indeed \\( (3y - 5)^2 \\).\n\nBut let's explore another method to confirm\u2014just to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Trying Standard Quadratic Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's attempt to factor it using the standard method by finding two numbers that:\n- Multiply to \\(a \\times c = 9 \\times 25 = 225\\)\n- Add up to \\(b = -30\\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Looking for numbers that multiply to \\(225\\) and add to \\(-30\\):\n  \n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  15 \\times 15 & = 225 \\\\\n  15 + 15 & = 30 \\quad (\\text{but we need} -30)\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n  \nSo, we should use \\(-15\\) and \\(-15\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n-15 \\times -15 & = 225 \\\\\n-15 + (-15) & = -30\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Factoring the Quadratic:**\n- Rewrite the middle term using these numbers:\n  \n  \\[\n  9y^2 - 15y - 15y + 25\n  \\]\n  \n- Group the terms:\n  \n  \\[\n  (9y^2 - 15y) + (-15y + 25)\n  \\]\n  \n- Factor each group:\n  \n  \\[\n  3y(3y - 5) - 5(3y - 5)\n  \\]\n  \n- Factor out the common binomial:\n  \n  \\[\n  (3y - 5)(3y - 5) = (3y - 5)^2\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThis confirms our earlier factorization. Both methods lead to \\( (3y - 5)^2 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nUsing standard quadratic factorization also points to the same factored form, reinforcing that the original expression is indeed a perfect square trinomial.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying with the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAs a final check, let's use the quadratic formula to find the roots and see if they align with our factored form.\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(a = 9\\)\n- \\(b = -30\\)\n- \\(c = 25\\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nb^2 - 4ac & = (-30)^2 - 4 \\times 9 \\times 25 \\\\\n           & = 900 - 900 \\\\\n           & = 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSince the discriminant is \\(0\\), there is exactly **one real root**:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny & = \\frac{30 \\pm 0}{18} \\\\\n  & = \\frac{30}{18} \\\\\n  & = \\frac{5}{3}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reconstructing the Factored Form:**\n\nIf the quadratic has a double root at \\(y = \\frac{5}{3}\\), it can be written as:\n\n\\[\n(y - \\frac{5}{3})^2\n\\]\n\nMultiplying out:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(y - \\frac{5}{3})(y - \\frac{5}{3}) & = y^2 - \\frac{5}{3}y - \\frac{5}{3}y + \\frac{25}{9} \\\\\n                                   & = y^2 - \\frac{10}{3}y + \\frac{25}{9}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, we need to match it with \\(9y^2 - 30y + 25\\). So, let's multiply this by \\(9\\) to align the leading coefficient:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n9(y^2 - \\frac{10}{3}y + \\frac{25}{9}) & = 9y^2 - 30y + 25\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThis matches the original expression exactly!\n\n**Reflection:**  \nUsing the quadratic formula confirms the root and aligns with our perfect square trinomial factorization. All methods consistently lead to \\( (3y - 5)^2 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough exploring different strategies\u2014recognizing it as a perfect square trinomial, applying standard quadratic factorization, and verifying with the quadratic formula\u2014we've consistently arrived at the same factored form:\n\n\\[\n9y^2 - 30y + 25 = (3y - 5)^2\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nStarting with the intuition about it being a perfect square trinomial was correct. Testing it with multiple methods ensured the validity of the solution. Reflecting and checking along the way helped catch and confirm each step, leading to a robust and correct factorization.",
