    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether each approach is working, and adjust my methods as necessary. It's important to mimic natural human thinking\u2014making mistakes, having \"aha\" moments, and checking along the way to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Intersection of Lines:** The task is to find the point \\( P = (a, b) \\) where the line \\( y = 2x - 10 \\) intersects with another line passing through the points \\( (7, 8) \\) and \\( (9, 0) \\).\n  \n- **Compute \\( a + b \\):** After finding the intersection point, I need to add the coordinates together.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Find the Equation of the Second Line:** I think it's essential to determine the equation of the line that passes through \\( (7, 8) \\) and \\( (9, 0) \\). Once I have both line equations, I can find their intersection.\n\n2. **Solving for Intersection:** After having both line equations, I could set them equal to each other to find the intersection point.\n\n3. **Alternative Methods:** Maybe there's a quicker way, like using slope and intercepts more intuitively, but starting with finding the second line seems straightforward.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Calculate the slope of the line through \\( (7, 8) \\) and \\( (9, 0) \\), then use the point-slope form to find its equation.\n\n- **Strategy 2:** Use the two-point form of a line to directly write the equation of the second line.\n\n- **Strategy 3:** After finding both line equations, solve the system of equations to find the intersection.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth strategies involve finding the equation of the second line first. I think starting with the slope method (\\( \\text{Strategy 1} \\)) might be more intuitive, but using the two-point form (\\( \\text{Strategy 2} \\)) could be more direct. Let me try **Strategy 1** first and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the Equation of the Second Line**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Calculating the Slope (\\( m \\)):** The slope \\( m \\) of a line passing through two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is given by:\n  \n  \\[\n  m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Given Points:** From the problem, the points are \\( (7, 8) \\) and \\( (9, 0) \\). Let me plug these into the slope formula.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{0 - 8}{9 - 7} = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, the slope is negative (\\( -4 \\)). This makes sense because the line goes from \\( (7, 8) \\) down to \\( (9, 0) \\).\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- **Use the Point-Slope Form:** Now that I have the slope, I can use the point-slope form of the line equation:\n\n  \\[\n  y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n  \\]\n  \n  Using point \\( (7, 8) \\):\n\n  \\[\n  y - 8 = -4(x - 7)\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\nThis feels right. The point-slope form is a reliable way to write the equation of a line given a point and a slope. Let me simplify this equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Equation of the Second Line**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Distribute the Slope:** I need to simplify the equation to get it into the slope-intercept form (\\( y = mx + b \\)), which is easier to work with for finding intersections.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\ny - 8 = -4(x - 7)\n\\]\n\\[\ny - 8 = -4x + 28\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -4x + 36\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, now I have the equation of the second line: \\( y = -4x + 36 \\). This seems correct. I'm now ready to find the intersection point of the two lines.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- **Set the Two Equations Equal:** To find the intersection point, I need to solve the system of equations:\n\n  \\[\n  y = 2x - 10\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = -4x + 36\n  \\]\n\n  So, set them equal to each other:\n\n  \\[\n  2x - 10 = -4x + 36\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for the Intersection Point**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Isolate \\( x \\):** I need to solve for \\( x \\) to find the coordinates of the intersection point.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n2x - 10 = -4x + 36\n\\]\n\n- **Add \\( 4x \\) to Both Sides:**\n\n  \\[\n  2x + 4x - 10 = 36\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  6x - 10 = 36\n  \\]\n\n- **Add 10 to Both Sides:**\n\n  \\[\n  6x = 46\n  \\]\n\n- **Divide by 6:**\n\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{46}{6} = \\frac{23}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, \\( x = \\frac{23}{3} \\)\u2014that looks like a proper fraction. Let me quickly check if this makes sense. The slope and intercepts were calculated correctly earlier, so I think this value is reasonable.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- **Find Corresponding \\( y \\)-Value:** Now that I have \\( x \\), I need to substitute it back into one of the original equations to find \\( y \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's use \\( y = 2x - 10 \\):\n\n\\[\ny = 2\\left(\\frac{23}{3}\\right) - 10\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{46}{3} - 10\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{46}{3} - \\frac{30}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{16}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, the intersection point is \\( \\left(\\frac{23}{3}, \\frac{16}{3}\\right) \\). This seems consistent. The calculations check out, and the fractions are manageable.\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, does this \\( y \\)-value make sense? Let me quickly substitute \\( x = \\frac{23}{3} \\) into the second equation \\( y = -4x + 36 \\) to verify.\n\n\\[\ny = -4\\left(\\frac{23}{3}\\right) + 36\n\\]\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{92}{3} + \\frac{108}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{16}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth equations yield the same \\( y \\)-value when \\( x = \\frac{23}{3} \\). This confirms that the intersection point is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Computing \\( a + b \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Identifying \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):** From the intersection point \\( P = \\left(\\frac{23}{3}, \\frac{16}{3}\\right) \\), I can assign \\( a = \\frac{23}{3} \\) and \\( b = \\frac{16}{3} \\).\n\n- **Adding Them Together:** I need to compute \\( a + b \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\na + b = \\frac{23}{3} + \\frac{16}{3} = \\frac{39}{3} = 13\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe sum \\( a + b = 13 \\) looks straightforward. The fractions added up neatly, and the final value is an integer. This makes sense given the problem's context.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Quick Reflection:**\n\n- **Did I Follow the Correct Steps?** Yes, I found the equation of the second line, solved for the intersection point, and computed \\( a + b \\).\n\n- **Are the Calculations Correct?** Substituting back into the original equations confirmed the intersection point, so the calculations are likely correct.\n\n- **Does the Final Answer Make Sense?** Adding the coordinates resulted in a clear integer, which fits the problem's requirements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter brainstorming, trying different strategies, and checking my work at each step, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]\n\nThis approach ensures that each part of the problem is addressed carefully, reflecting natural human problem-solving with checks and adjustments along the way.",

  "ground_truth": "The slope of the line through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$ is $\\frac{8-0}{7-9}=\\frac{8}{-2}=-4$.  Thus, the line has equation $y=-4x+b$ for some $b$.  Since $B(9,0)$ lies on this line, we have $0=-4(9)+b \\Rightarrow b=36$, and thus the equation of the line is $y=-4x+36$.\n\nTo determine the point of intersection between the lines having equations $y=-4x+36$ and $y=2x-10$, we set the two expressions for $y$ equal to each other and solve for $x$.  We have $-4x+36=2x-10 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{23}{3}$.  It follows that  $y=2x-10=2\\left(\\frac{23}{3}\\right)-10 = \\frac{46}{3}-\\frac{30}{3}=\\frac{16}{3}$.\n\nThus, $P=(\\frac{23}{3},\\frac{16}{3})$ and $a+b=\\frac{23}{3}+\\frac{16}{3}=\\frac{39}{3}=\\boxed{13}$."
