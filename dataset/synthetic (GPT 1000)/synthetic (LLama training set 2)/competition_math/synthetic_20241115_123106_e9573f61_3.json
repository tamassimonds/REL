I remember dealing with factorials before, especially when it comes to combinations or permutations. \n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:**  \n  - Factorials represent the product of all positive integers up to a certain number.  \n  - The expression involves ratios of factorials, which often comes up in combinations: \\(\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\\).  \n  - Maybe this is related to finding a combination or permutation.  \n  - But \\(\\binom{9}{3}\\) is \\(\\frac{9!}{3!6!}\\), so this seems directly related to that.  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  - Wait, the denominator has \\(6!\\) and \\(3!\\), and the numerator has \\(9!\\).  \n  - That matches the form of a combination almost exactly: \\(\\binom{9}{3}\\).  \n  - So, perhaps this expression is simplifying to \\(\\binom{9}{3}\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI think this problem is asking for \\(\\binom{9}{3}\\), the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of 9.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\nNow that I have an idea, let's explore how to compute \\(\\dfrac{9!}{6!3!}\\).\n\n- **Horizon Thinking:** \n  - **Option 1:** Simplify the factorials directly.  \n  - **Option 2:** Recognize it as a combination and use the properties of combinations.  \n  - **Option 3:** Cancel out factorial parts before dividing to minimize calculations.  \n- **Initial Preference:**  \n  - Simplifying factorials directly seems straightforward but might get messy.  \n  - Recognizing it as a combination could streamline the process.  \n- **Wait a Moment:**  \n  - But should I simplify the factorials entirely, or can I cancel parts first?  \n  - Canceling parts first might make calculations easier.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nLet's try canceling parts of the factorials first to see if it simplifies the computation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Attempting Strategy 1 - Simplify Factorials Directly**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's start by expanding the factorials in the numerator and denominator to see if something cancels out.\n\n- **Calculations:**  \n  \\[\n  \\dfrac{9!}{6!3!} = \\dfrac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6!}{6! \\times 3!}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  - Oh! The \\(6!\\) in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out.\n  - That simplifies to:\n    \\[\n    \\dfrac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{3!}\n    \\]\n    \n- **Quick Check:**  \n  - Does cancelling make sense?  \n  - Yes, \\(6!\\) is common in both, so it cancels out.\n\n**Progress So Far:**  \nWe're left with \\(\\dfrac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{3!}\\). This seems much more manageable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Continuing with Strategy 1 - Simplify Further**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, let's deal with \\(3!\\) in the denominator. We know \\(3! = 6\\), so that should simplify things.\n\n- **Calculations:**  \n  \\[\n  \\dfrac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{3!} = \\dfrac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{6}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  - Wait a second, multiplying before dividing might make things messy.  \n  - Perhaps I should divide step by step to avoid dealing with large numbers.  \n- **Adjusting Approach:**  \n  - Let's divide \\(9\\) by \\(6\\) first, since \\(3! = 6\\).  \n  - That simplifies to:\n    \\[\n    \\dfrac{9}{6} \\times 8 \\times 7 = \\dfrac{3}{2} \\times 8 \\times 7\n    \\]\n    \n**Conclusion:**  \nThis way seems cleaner. Multiplying smaller fractions reduces the complexity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Multiplication**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, let's multiply \\(\\dfrac{3}{2}\\) by \\(8\\) and then by \\(7\\).\n\n- **Calculations:**  \n  \\[\n  \\dfrac{3}{2} \\times 8 = \\dfrac{3 \\times 8}{2} = \\dfrac{24}{2} = 12\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  12 \\times 7 = 84\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  - Multiplying step by step makes it easier to manage.  \n  - Wait, let me double-check if each step feels right.  \n- **Check:**  \n  - \\(\\dfrac{3}{2} \\times 8\\) simplifies to \\(12\\), and multiplying \\(12 \\times 7\\) gives \\(84\\).  \n  - That seems correct.\n\n**Progress So Far:**  \nThe final answer is \\(84\\). This matches what we expect from the combination formula \\(\\binom{9}{3}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verifying the Result with Strategy 2 - Combination Interpretation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet me cross-check this result by viewing the original expression as a combination calculation.\n\n- **Recall:**  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{n}{r} = \\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n  \\]\n  \n  Given \\(\\dfrac{9!}{6!3!}\\), this fits the form where \\(n = 9\\), \\(r = 3\\), and \\(n - r = 6\\).\n  \n- **Reflection:**  \n  - So, \\(\\binom{9}{3} = 84\\) by definition.\n  - This confirms that our earlier calculation was correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBoth strategies lead to the same result: \\(84\\). This consistency strengthens the validity of the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Conclusion**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  - Initially, I considered simplifying factorials directly or recognizing the expression as a combination.\n  - By canceling common factorial parts early, the calculation became more straightforward.\n  - Step-by-step multiplication ensured accuracy and avoided dealing with large numbers unnecessarily.\n  \n- **Check:**  \n  - Throughout, I double-checked each step to ensure correctness.\n  - Both methods\u2014simplifying factorials and applying the combination formula\u2014yielded the same result.\n  \n- **Final Answer:**  \n  \\[\n  \\dfrac{9!}{6!3!} = 84\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Notes**\n\n- **Visualization:**  \n  - Thinking of \\(\\dfrac{9!}{6!3!}\\) as \\(\\binom{9}{3}\\) helped recognize its combinatorial nature, making the problem more intuitive.\n  \n- **Alternative Approaches:**  \n  - Another way could be to compute \\(9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\) but that seems unnecessary and cumbersome compared to the strategies used.\n\n- **Learning Insight:**  \n  - Leveraging known formulas (like the combination formula) can simplify seemingly complex factorial problems.\n  \nBy thinking through different strategies, checking each step, and confirming the result through multiple approaches, I've ensured the solution is both correct and efficient.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps in understanding how to approach and solve factorial-related problems step by step!",
