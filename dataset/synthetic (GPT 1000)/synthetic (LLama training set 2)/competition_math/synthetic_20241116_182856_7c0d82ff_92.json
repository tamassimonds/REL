I'll take you through my thought process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking if I'm on the right track, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like how I would tackle a problem in real life.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see:  \n\\[ x = \\frac{2009^2 - 2009}{2009} \\]\n\nImmediately, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Familiar Structure:** The expression resembles a fraction where the numerator involves a squared term and subtraction. This reminds me of factoring expressions.\n\n2. **Simplifying Fractions:** It looks like a simplification problem where I need to reduce the fraction by possibly canceling out common terms.\n\n3. **Numerical Operations:** Given the large number (2009), I wonder if calculating \\(2009^2\\) directly is necessary or if there's a smarter way to simplify the expression first.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure which approach is the best right now. Maybe starting by simplifying the fraction makes sense, but I also toy with the idea of factoring the numerator.\n\nLet's brainstorm a bit:\n\n- **Option 1:** Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2009.\n- **Option 2:** Factor the numerator \\(2009^2 - 2009\\) to see if common factors with the denominator can be canceled.\n- **Option 3:** Calculate \\(2009^2\\) directly and then simplify step by step.\n\nI think starting with **Option 2**, factoring the numerator, might be the most efficient. Factoring could reveal common terms that simplify the fraction more elegantly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Factoring the Numerator**\n\nLet's try factoring \\(2009^2 - 2009\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI recall that the expression resembles a difference of squares or a common factoring scenario. The expression can be factored by taking out the common term.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[ \n2009^2 - 2009 = 2009 \\times 2009 - 2009 \\times 1 \n\\]\n\nSo, factoring out \\(2009\\):\n\n\\[ \n2009^2 - 2009 = 2009 \\times (2009 - 1) = 2009 \\times 2008 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, that seems straightforward! By factoring out \\(2009\\), the numerator simplifies nicely. This looks promising because it might allow for cancellation with the denominator.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Fraction**\n\nNow, let's substitute the factored numerator back into the original equation:\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{2009 \\times 2008}{2009} \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAt this point, I see that \\(2009\\) is both in the numerator and the denominator. This suggests cancellation is possible.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{\\cancel{2009} \\times 2008}{\\cancel{2009}} = 2008 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nCancelling out \\(2009\\) simplifies the expression to \\(x = 2008\\). This seems correct because I've reduced the fraction to its simplest form.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nLet me think\u2014removing \\(2009\\) from both the numerator and denominator is valid as long as \\(2009 \\neq 0\\), which it isn\u2019t. So, the cancellation is legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\nEven though the simplification seems correct, it's always a good idea to verify the result.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI should check if substituting \\(x = 2008\\) back into the original equation holds true.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's replace \\(x\\) with \\(2008\\) in the original expression:\n\n\\[ \n2008 = \\frac{2009^2 - 2009}{2009} \n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[ \n2009^2 - 2009 = 2009 \\times 2008 \n\\]\n\nNow, substitute back:\n\n\\[ \n2008 = \\frac{2009 \\times 2008}{2009} = 2008 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe equation holds true, confirming that \\(x = 2008\\) is indeed correct.\n\n**Check:**  \nEverything checks out. The simplification process was valid, and verifying the solution aligns with the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering Alternative Approaches**\n\nAlthough the factoring method worked well, let's briefly explore another strategy to ensure completeness.\n\n**Option 1:**  \n**Simplify Before Factoring**\n\nInstead of factoring, perhaps I could simplify the fraction directly by dividing both numerator and denominator by \\(2009\\). Let's see if that leads to the same result.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{2009^2 - 2009}{2009} \n\\]\n\nDivide each term in the numerator by \\(2009\\):\n\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{2009}{2009} \\times 2009 - \\frac{2009}{2009} \\times 1 = 2009 - 1 = 2008 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis alternative approach also yields \\(x = 2008\\). It confirms the result obtained through factoring.\n\n**Check:**  \nBoth methods produce the same result, validating the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nInitially, I brainstormed different strategies to tackle the problem, settling on factoring the numerator as the most efficient approach. Throughout the process, I reflected and checked each step to ensure accuracy. Considering an alternative method reinforced the solution's validity.\n\nIn conclusion, the value of \\(x\\) is **2008**.\n\n---\n\nBy thinking through each step, exploring various strategies, and verifying the solution, I've ensured a thorough and correct approach to solving the problem.",
