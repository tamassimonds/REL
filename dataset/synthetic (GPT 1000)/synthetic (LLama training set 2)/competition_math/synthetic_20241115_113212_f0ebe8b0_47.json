    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I\u2019ll walk through it step by step, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking my work along the way to ensure I\u2019m on the right track. It's important to think it through like a human would, including brainstorming, making mistakes, and having those \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 6x - 8y + 24\\), I recognize that it resembles the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\). This makes me think that perhaps I need to **complete the square** to rewrite the equation in a more familiar form.\n\nBut then I wonder, \"Is completing the square the only way? Maybe there's another method.\" Perhaps I could also think about converting it to the standard circle equation directly. Let me brainstorm a bit:\n\n- **Strategy 1:** Complete the square to find the center and radius.\n- **Strategy 2:** Use the general form of a circle and identify the center and radius from there.\n- **Strategy 3:** Graph the equation (if possible) to visually determine the center and radius.\n\nInitially, **Strategy 1**\u2014completing the square\u2014seems the most straightforward for identifying the center. But I\u2019ll keep **Strategy 2** in mind as a backup if completing the square gets messy.\n\nNow, let's try **Strategy 1**: completing the square.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Completing the Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo write the equation in the standard form of a circle, I need to complete the square for both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms. This should give me the center \\((h, k)\\) of the circle.\n\n**Equation:**  \n\\[ x^2 + y^2 = 6x - 8y + 24 \\]\n\n**Reorganizing Terms:**  \nLet\u2019s bring all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms to one side:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 8y = 24 \\]\n\n**Completing the Square for \\(x\\) Terms:**  \nI need to turn \\(x^2 - 6x\\) into a perfect square trinomial.\n\n- Take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\): \\(\\frac{-6}{2} = -3\\)\n- Square it: \\((-3)^2 = 9\\)\n\nSo, add and subtract 9 inside the equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 6x + 9 - 9 + y^2 + 8y = 24 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ (x - 3)^2 - 9 + y^2 + 8y = 24 \\]\n\n**Completing the Square for \\(y\\) Terms:**  \nNow, do the same for \\(y^2 + 8y\\).\n\n- Take half of the coefficient of \\(y\\): \\(\\frac{8}{2} = 4\\)\n- Square it: \\(4^2 = 16\\)\n\nAdd and subtract 16:\n\n\\[ (x - 3)^2 - 9 + (y + 4)^2 - 16 = 24 \\]\n\n**Final Equation After Completing the Square:**  \nCombine constants on the right side:\n\n\\[ (x - 3)^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 24 + 9 + 16 \\]  \n\\[ (x - 3)^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 49 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute, does this make sense? Yes, because \\(49 = 7^2\\), which means the radius \\(r = 7\\). So, the center of the circle is \\((3, -4)\\).\n\n**Check:**  \nI double-check my completing the square:\n\n- For \\(x\\): \\(x^2 - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)^2\\)\n- For \\(y\\): \\(y^2 + 8y + 16 = (y + 4)^2\\)\n\nEverything seems correct. The center is indeed \\((3, -4)\\), and the radius is 7.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Point**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I know the center of the circle is \\((3, -4)\\), I need to find the distance between this center and the given point \\((-3, -12)\\).\n\n**Distance Formula:**  \nRecall the distance formula between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\):\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\n**Assigning Coordinates:**\n- Center: \\((3, -4)\\)\n- Given Point: \\((-3, -12)\\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{((-3) - 3)^2 + ((-12) - (-4))^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{(-6)^2 + (-8)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{36 + 64}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{100}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe distance is 10. This value makes sense because the radius of the circle is 7, and the distance from the center to the point is greater than the radius, so the point lies outside the circle.\n\n**Check:**  \n- Calculation of differences: \\((-3) - 3 = -6\\) and \\((-12) - (-4) = -8\\) are correct.\n- Squaring these values: \\(36\\) and \\(64\\) are accurate.\n- Sum under the square root: \\(100\\) is correct, leading to a distance of \\(10\\).\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Using the General Form of a Circle**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nJust to ensure that my previous method was correct, let\u2019s consider another approach\u2014using the general form of a circle to identify the center directly.\n\n**General Form of a Circle:**\nThe general form is:\n\\[\nAx^2 + Ay^2 + Bx + Cy + D = 0\n\\]\nBut for circles, \\(A = 1\\). So, the standard circle equation is:\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + Bx + Cy + D = 0\n\\]\n\n**Given Equation:**\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 - 6x + 8y - 24 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Identifying Coefficients:**\nFrom the standard form:\n- \\(B = -6\\)\n- \\(C = 8\\)\n- \\(D = -24\\)\n\n**Calculating the Center \\((h, k)\\):**\n\\[\nh = -\\frac{B}{2} = -\\frac{-6}{2} = 3\n\\]\n\\[\nk = -\\frac{C}{2} = -\\frac{8}{2} = -4\n\\]\n\nSo, the center is \\((3, -4)\\), which matches our previous result.\n\n**Calculating the Radius \\(r\\):**\n\\[\nr^2 = h^2 + k^2 - D = 3^2 + (-4)^2 - (-24) = 9 + 16 + 24 = 49\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{49} = 7\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis alternative method confirms that the center is \\((3, -4)\\) and the radius is \\(7\\). The distance to the point \\((-3, -12)\\) being \\(10\\) is consistent with our earlier calculations.\n\n**Check:**  \n- Calculations for \\(h\\) and \\(k\\) are correct.\n- Radius calculation checks out: \\(9 + 16 + 24 = 49\\).\n- Everything aligns with the first method.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying each step, I've determined that:\n\n- The center of the circle is \\((3, -4)\\).\n- The distance between the center and the point \\((-3, -12)\\) is \\(10\\).\n\nBoth methods\u2014completing the square and using the general form\u2014yield the same result, confirming the correctness of the solution. The distance of \\(10\\) indicates that the point lies outside the circle, which aligns with our calculations.\n\nFeel free to ask if there are any more questions or if further clarification is needed!",

  "ground_truth": "Moving terms to the LHS, we have $x^2-6x+y^2+8y=24$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(6/2)^2=9$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(8/2)^2=16$ to both sides. We are left with the equation $x^2-6x+9+y^2+8y+16=49 \\Rightarrow (x-3)^2+(y+4)^2=49$. Thus, our circle has center $(3,-4)$. The distance between this center and the point $(-3,-12)$ is $\\sqrt{(-3-3)^2+(-12-(-4))^2}=\\boxed{10}$."
