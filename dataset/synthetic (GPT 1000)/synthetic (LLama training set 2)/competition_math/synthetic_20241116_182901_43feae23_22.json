    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking how I would naturally think through it as a human.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question, I think, **\"Okay, Kadin is making a snowman with three spherical snowballs of different radii: 2 inches, 3 inches, and 5 inches. I need to find the total volume of these snowballs combined, expressed in terms of \u03c0.\"**\n\nThis reminds me of another problem I\u2019ve solved before involving the volumes of spheres. I remember that the volume of a sphere is calculated using the formula \\( V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius. **Wait, that's the formula I need! But let me think if there\u2019s a more straightforward way to approach this or if I should just apply the formula directly for each snowball.**\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nThinking through it, I have a few options:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of each snowball individually using the formula and then add them up.**\n2. **Factor out \u03c0 from each volume calculation to make the addition simpler.**\n3. **Check if there\u2019s a pattern or relationship between the radii that might simplify calculations.**\n\n**Reflection:** The first option seems the most straightforward, but factoring out \u03c0 might make the arithmetic easier. However, factoring might introduce complexity I wasn't expecting. **Maybe starting with factoring out \u03c0 is a good idea to see if it simplifies things.**\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\nI'll start by **factoring out \u03c0** to see how it plays out:\n\n- **Factoring out \u03c0:**\n  \\[\n  V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\text{ for each radius } r\n  \\]\n  So,\n  \\[\n  V_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (2^3 + 3^3 + 5^3)\n  \\]\n  \n**Wait a second...** **Does this seem right?** Factoring out \u03c0 makes the calculation look cleaner, but I need to ensure I\u2019m not complicating things unnecessarily.\n\n**Alternative Idea:** Maybe calculating each volume separately is better to avoid mistakes.\n\n**Decision:** Let\u2019s **proceed with factoring out \u03c0** and see how it goes. If it gets messy, I\u2019ll switch strategies.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Each Volume**\n\nLet me **compute \\( 2^3 \\), \\( 3^3 \\), and \\( 5^3 \\):**\n\n- \\( 2^3 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 3^3 = 27 \\)\n- \\( 5^3 = 125 \\)\n\n**Quick Check:** **That seems correct; those are simple cubes.**\n\n### **Step 2: Sum the Cubes**\n\nNow, **add these numbers together:**\n\\[\n8 + 27 + 125 = 160\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** **This addition looks straightforward. No mistakes so far.**\n\n### **Step 3: Multiply by the Constant Factor**\n\nNext, **multiply by the constant factors:**\n\\[\nV_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 160\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} \\times 160 = \\frac{640}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:** **Multiplying 4 by 160 gives 640, and dividing by 3 is straightforward.**\n\n### **Step 4: Express in Terms of \u03c0**\n\nSo, **the total volume is:**\n\\[\nV_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{640}{3} \\pi\n\\]\n\n**Wait, let me reflect:** **Does this make sense?** Yes, factoring out \u03c0 early made the calculation cleaner, and the arithmetic checks out.\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Calculating Each Volume Separately**\n\nTo ensure correctness, **let's also calculate each volume separately and then sum them up:**\n\n- **Volume of the 2-inch snowball:**\n  \\[\n  V_1 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (2^3) = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 8 = \\frac{32}{3} \\pi\n  \\]\n- **Volume of the 3-inch snowball:**\n  \\[\n  V_2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3^3) = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 27 = \\frac{108}{3} \\pi = 36 \\pi\n  \\]\n- **Volume of the 5-inch snowball:**\n  \\[\n  V_3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (5^3) = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 125 = \\frac{500}{3} \\pi\n  \\]\n\n**Sum of Volumes:**\n\\[\nV_{\\text{total}} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 = \\frac{32}{3} \\pi + 36 \\pi + \\frac{500}{3} \\pi\n\\]\n\n**Combining Like Terms:**\n\\[\nV_{\\text{total}} = \\left( \\frac{32}{3} + \\frac{500}{3} + 36 \\right) \\pi = \\left( \\frac{532}{3} + 36 \\right) \\pi\n\\]\n\n**Converting 36 to Thirds:**\n\\[\n36 = \\frac{108}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Adding Fractions:**\n\\[\n\\frac{532}{3} + \\frac{108}{3} = \\frac{640}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Final Volume:**\n\\[\nV_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{640}{3} \\pi\n\\]\n\n**Check:** **Both methods yield the same result, confirming its correctness.**\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nBoth strategies\u2014**factoring out \u03c0 from the beginning** and **calculating each volume separately**\u2014led to the same answer. Factoring out \u03c0 initially simplified the arithmetic, making the calculation more straightforward.\n\n**Mistakes or Dead Ends?** Initially, I hesitated whether factoring out \u03c0 would complicate things, but following through, it actually streamlined the process. **It's always good to check if an idea simplifies the work or adds unnecessary complexity.**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{640}{3} \\pi}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:** **Taking time to brainstorm and reflection ensured the approach was correct. By exploring different strategies and checking the work regularly, I confidently arrived at the correct solution.**",
