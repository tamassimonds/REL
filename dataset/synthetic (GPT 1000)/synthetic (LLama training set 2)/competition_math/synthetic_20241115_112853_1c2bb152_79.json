Calculate \\( a + b \\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Looks Familiar:** This reminds me of solving systems of linear equations. I've done similar problems where you substitute values to find coefficients.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Substitution Method:** Substitute the given \\( x \\) values to create equations and solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n  - **Matrix Method:** Use matrices to solve a system, but that feels a bit overkill for two equations.\n  - **Graphical Method:** Graph the lines to find intersections, but I don't think that's necessary here.\n  - **Check Using an Example:** Maybe plug in random values to see if they match, but that might not help much without knowing \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSubstituting the given \\( x \\) values into the expression to create a system of equations seems the most straightforward. Let's start with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equations**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- I know that \\( a + bx \\) equals certain values at specific \\( x \\) points. So, I can set up two equations based on the given information.\n\n**Given:**  \n1. \\( a + 2b = 15 \\)   (when \\( x = 2 \\))\n2. \\( a + 5b = 3 \\)    (when \\( x = 5 \\))\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- These are two linear equations with two unknowns (\\( a \\) and \\( b \\)). Solving this system should give me the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Does this make sense? Yes, because each equation provides a unique constraint on \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). With two equations, I should be able to find a unique solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Let's use the **Elimination Method**. I'll try to eliminate one variable by subtracting one equation from the other.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Subtract the First Equation from the Second:**\n  \n  \\[\n  (a + 5b) - (a + 2b) = 3 - 15\n  \\]\n  \n  Simplifying:\n\n  \\[\n  a + 5b - a - 2b = -12 \\\\\n  3b = -12\n  \\]\n\n- **Solve for \\( b \\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  b = \\frac{-12}{3} = -4\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Wait, that can't be right because in the original problem, the value of the expression when \\( x = 5 \\) is much smaller than when \\( x = 2 \\). Having \\( b = -4 \\) seems too large in magnitude.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Did I make a mistake? Let's double-check the arithmetic.\n\n**Rechecking:**\n- **Re-examine the subtraction:**\n  \n  \\[\n  (a + 5b) - (a + 2b) = 3 - 15 \\\\\n  a + 5b - a - 2b = -12 \\\\\n  3b = -12 \\quad (\\text{correct})\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solve for \\( b \\):**\n  \n  \\[\n  b = -4 \\quad (\\text{correct})\n  \\]\n\n**Wait a Moment:**\n- Although the arithmetic is correct, \\( b = -4 \\) seems off intuitively. Let's proceed and see if it leads to a sensible value for \\( a \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\( a \\)**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Now that we have \\( b = -4 \\), let's substitute back into one of the original equations to find \\( a \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Substitute \\( b = -4 \\) into the First Equation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  a + 2(-4) = 15 \\\\\n  a - 8 = 15\n  \\]\n  \n  Solving for \\( a \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  a = 15 + 8 = 23\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n- So, \\( a = 23 \\) and \\( b = -4 \\). Let's quickly substitute both into the second equation to see if they hold true.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Second Equation:**\n  \n  \\[\n  a + 5b = 3 \\\\\n  23 + 5(-4) = 3 \\\\\n  23 - 20 = 3 \\quad (\\text{correct})\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- Both equations are satisfied with \\( a = 23 \\) and \\( b = -4 \\). Even though \\( b = -4 \\) seemed off initially, it makes the equations work correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating \\( a + b \\)**\n\n**Approach:**\n- Now that we have both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), let's calculate \\( a + b \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n  \n\\[\na + b = 23 + (-4) = 23 - 4 = 19\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this make sense? The expression \\( a + bx \\) at \\( x = 2 \\) was 15:\n\n  \\[\n  23 + (-4)(2) = 23 - 8 = 15 \\quad (\\text{matches})\n  \\]\n  \n- At \\( x = 5 \\):\n\n  \\[\n  23 + (-4)(5) = 23 - 20 = 3 \\quad (\\text{matches})\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- The final answer \\( a + b = 19 \\) checks out because it satisfies both original conditions. Despite the initial hesitation about the value of \\( b \\), the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Step: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Did the Elimination Method Work?** Yes, it correctly led to \\( b = -4 \\) and \\( a = 23 \\).\n- **Could Another Method Have Been Better?** Perhaps using the **Substitution Method** directly might have felt more intuitive, but the Elimination Method was straightforward here.\n\n**Decision:**\n- **Stick with the Elimination Method:** It provided the correct solution, and checking against the original equations confirmed its validity.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n- **Alternative Approach:** If I had used the Substitution Method, I would have solved one equation for \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\) and then substituted that into the other. It might have avoided the initial confusion about \\( b \\)'s value, but ultimately, both methods lead to the same solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully setting up and solving the system of equations using the Elimination Method, checking each step for correctness, and reflecting on the approach, the value of \\( a + b \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{19}\n\\]\n\nThe process involved brainstorming different strategies, selecting the most straightforward method, checking calculations along the way, and ensuring the final answer aligns with both original conditions. Even though initial doubts arose about the value of \\( b \\), consistent checking confirmed the correctness of the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we write out the problem in equation form:\n\n\\begin{align*}\na + 2b &= 15, \\\\\na + 5b &= 3.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we have $3b = -12 \\implies b = -4$. Then, substituting $b = -4$ into the first equation: \\begin{align*}\na + 2(-4) &= 15, \\\\\na &= 23.\n\\end{align*} so $a + b = 23 - 4 = \\boxed{19}$."
