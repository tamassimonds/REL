    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving this problem step by step. Understanding the problem is crucial here. We're dealing with a right triangle \\(ABC\\), where \\(\\angle A\\) is \\(90^\\circ\\). We're given the lengths \\(AB = 16\\) and \\(BC = 24\\), and we need to find \\(\\sin A\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n1. When I saw \\(\\angle A = 90^\\circ\\), this immediately indicated that triangle \\(ABC\\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \\(A\\).\n2. We know \\(\\sin A\\) for a right angle is not defined in the conventional sense because \\(\\sin\\) of \\(90^\\circ\\) should be related to one of the triangle's features.\n3. With a right triangle, trigonometric ratios like sine and cosine are based on non-right angles. So, something seems off\u2014\\(\\sin A\\), where \\(A\\) is \\(90^\\circ\\), is a special scenario.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait, because \\(\\angle A\\) is \\(90^\\circ\\), that would actually mean finding \\(\\sin 90^\\circ\\). But here's what I noticed: \\(\\sin 90^\\circ\\) is simply \\(1\\) because in the unit circle, \\(\\sin(90^\\circ)\\) is equal to the height, which is the full radius in a circle, here \\(1\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n1. \\(\\sin A = \\sin 90^\\circ\\). Let me think more about this.\n2. For a right triangle, typically, sine of an angle \\( \\theta\\) is opposite side over the hypotenuse, but in this special case of \\(90^\\circ\\), the opposite becomes the leg perpendicular to the hypoteneuse.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Before I commit to \\(\\sin 90^\\circ = 1\\), let's verify if that result aligns with the context.\n\n**Verification:**\n1. I know the Pythagorean Theorem relates the sides here: \\(AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2\\).\n2. Plug the given values into the theorem to find \\(AC\\):\n   \\[\n   16^2 + AC^2 = 24^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   256 + AC^2 = 576\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   AC^2 = 320\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   AC = \\sqrt{320} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 20} = 4\\sqrt{20} = 4\\sqrt{4 \\times 5} = 8\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n\n3. However, realizing this might not directly contribute to finding \\(\\sin A\\) because \\(\\angle A = 90^\\circ\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The careful approach confirms, this problem is tricking us into re-evaluating \\(\\sin 90^\\circ\\), which is definitively \\(1\\).\n  \nThus, for this specific angle:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nAll my checks align with mathematical properties stated\u2014a good grounding in theory indeed made solving this simpler. Here, some distractions (finding triangle side lengths) help conceptually understand, but aren't strictly necessary. My final thought: remember, \\(\\sin 90^\\circ\\) is always \\(1\\), a useful fact that simplifies matters.",
