    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Initially, I've got two boxes each containing a mix of black and white marbles, and together, they have 25 marbles. I need to find the probability that both marbles drawn, one from each box, are white given some information about black marbles. The question also asks for the sum of two integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), which are the numerator and the denominator of the probability of drawing two white marbles. Let's break this down and see how we approach it.\n\n### First Thoughts and Exploration\n\n1. **Understanding Given Probabilities**:\n   - Probability of both marbles being black is \\( \\frac{27}{50} \\).\n   - Probability of both marbles being white is \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\).\n\n2. **Considerations**:\n   - If one marble is drawn from each box, then the total combinations will be product of marbles in each box.\n\n3. **Initial Setup**:\n   - Let's denote the number of black and white marbles in the first box as \\( b_1 \\) and \\( w_1 \\), and as \\( b_2 \\) and \\( w_2 \\) for the second box.\n   - Sum conditions: \\( b_1 + w_1 + b_2 + w_2 = 25 \\).\n\n### Exploring Calculation for Black Marbles\n\n4. **Probability Formula**:\n   - Probability of drawing one black marble from each box: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{b_1}{b_1 + w_1} \\times \\frac{b_2}{b_2 + w_2} = \\frac{27}{50}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Reflection**:\n   - This formula helps relate the number of black marbles in each box to the probability value given.\n\n### Exploring Calculation for White Marbles\n\n6. **Probability Formula for White Marbles**:\n   - Probability of drawing one white marble from each box:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{w_1}{b_1 + w_1} \\times \\frac{w_2}{b_2 + w_2} = \\frac{m}{n}\n     \\]\n\n### Strategy Check and Adjustment\n\n7. **Analyze the Overall System**:\n   - We've got a system of equations related to both the probabilities and the relationships between these variables.\n   - Consider boundary behavior: If all marbles were black or white, then the probabilities wouldn't align with given ones.\n   - Analyze if there's an intuitive way, such as guessing reasonable numbers for \\( w_1, w_2, b_1, b_2 \\) and verifying.\n\n8. **Consider Factorization**:\n   - Factor the total number (e.g., 25) as a composition of numbers that satisfy both given probabilities.\n\n### Solve for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\)\n\n9. **Test Values and Calculations for Black Marbles**:\n   - Start with basic equations stated:\n     - \\( b_1 \\times b_2 / ((b_1 + w_1) (b_2 + w_2)) = 27 / 50 \\)\n     - With total black and white \\(= 25\\).\n\n10. **Iterative Trial and Error**:\n   - Choose viable integers for breakdown which fit the constraints.\n\n11. **Compute White Probability Solution**:\n    - Let\u2019s say values found satisfy \\( \\frac{w_1}{b_1 + w_1} \\times \\frac{w_2}{b_2 + w_2} = \\frac{m}{n} \\).\n\n12. **Simplify and Verify**:\n   - Check if found values reduce to lowest terms.\n   - Compute and confirm numerator and denominator as coprime.\n\n13. **Final Check**:\n   - Confirm if these values make sense in the probabilistic model.\n   - Sum \\( m + n \\) delivers final satisfaction.\n\nIn executing this, we should continuously double-check each theoretical approach by re-assessing basic assumptions or predicted outcomes. Once everything checks out, find \\( m+n \\), which validates through probabilities derived.\n\nUltimately, the exploration of numbers converges toward finding allocations satisfying both black and white conditions, thereby determining the correct \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) probability of white marbles, with sum yielding solution needed. Always essential to verify reality of derived solution fits all provided conditions.",

  "ground_truth": "If we work with the problem for a little bit, we quickly see that there is no direct combinatorics way to calculate $m/n$. The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion still requires us to find the individual probability of each box.\nLet $a, b$ represent the number of marbles in each box, and without loss of generality let $a>b$. Then, $a + b = 25$, and since the $ab$ may be reduced to form $50$ on the denominator of $\\frac{27}{50}$, $50|ab$. It follows that $5|a,b$, so there are 2 pairs of $a$ and $b: (20,5),(15,10)$.\nCase 1: Then the product of the number of black marbles in each box is $54$, so the only combination that works is $18$ black in first box, and $3$ black in second. Then, $P(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{2}{20} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{1}{25},$ so $m + n = 26$.\nCase 2: The only combination that works is 9 black in both. Thus, $P(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{1}{10}\\cdot \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{1}{25}$. $m + n = 26$.\nThus, $m + n = \\boxed{26}$."
