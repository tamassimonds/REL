    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s break down the problem step-by-step as if I\u2019m thinking through it naturally \u2013 with all the brainstorming, dead ends, and aha moments that might occur.\n\n---\n\n**First Thoughts:** \nWhen I look at this problem, I immediately see combinations involved, and it involves finding some integer \\( k \\). My first instinct is to remember the identity involving combinations: \\(\\binom{n}{r} + \\binom{n}{r+1} = \\binom{n+1}{r+1}\\). This looks like a good place to start because we have that sum on one side of the equation.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n- **Think Pairing Strategy:** Since it involves adding two combinations, I should test whether this identity can simplify the left-hand side of the equation. The expression \\(\\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5}\\) should simplify based on the identity I just recalled.\n  \n- **Check with the Identity:**\n  - Given \\(\\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5} = \\binom{24}{5}\\), I can choose \\(23\\) and any four or five items, according to the identities properties, to yield \\(\\binom{24}{5}\\).\n\n**Calculations and Reflections:**\n- Using the identity: \n  \\[\n  \\binom{n}{r} + \\binom{n}{r+1} = \\binom{n+1}{r+1}\n  \\]\n\n  - If \\(n = 23\\), and \\(r = 4\\), then:\n  \\[\n  \\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5} = \\binom{24}{5}\n  \\]\n\n- Now, compare it to the given expression \\(\\binom{24}{k}\\) to find \\(k\\). It must be that \\(k = 5\\).\n\n**Check and Recheck the Simplification:**\n- **Quick Re-evaluation:** Okay, I went through and verified the identity used in the simplification. Everything seems to fall into place. \\(\\binom{24}{5}\\) was invoked directly by both sides simplifying using the identity, making sense of the equality condition \\(\\binom{24}{k}\\).\n\n**Finally:**\n- **Answer Extraction and Verification:**\n  - The sum of all integers \\(k\\) such that the equality holds is simply \\(5\\).\n\n- I\u2019ll double-check by calculating smaller cases manually, to verify trust. I did locate the choices in this logic without deviation. All evidence points towards \\(k = 5\\) being correct since I reverted the identity directly. This validation is reinforcing when reassessed with computation as a base sweep check.\n\nThus, the final sum of the integers \\( k \\) such that \\(\\binom{24}{k} = \\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5}\\) is indeed \\( \\boxed{5} \\).\n\n---\n\nThroughout, I had to trust my intuition and relearn from any slight oversight or verification by strategic re-evaluation and reinforcement of the problem's core rule.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's take a step back and re-evaluate the problem to ensure we understand it correctly. \n\n**Re-evaluation and New Strategies:**\n\n**Revisiting the Original Problem:**\nThe problem asks us to find the sum of all integers \\( k \\) such that \\(\\binom{24}{k} = \\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5}\\).\n\n**Using Combinatorial Identities:**\nI previously used the identity \\(\\binom{n}{r} + \\binom{n}{r+1} = \\binom{n+1}{r+1}\\), which allowed me to simplify the left-hand side of the equation to \\(\\binom{24}{5}\\). At this point, I see that \\(\\binom{24}{5}\\) is indeed one solution, corresponding to \\(k = 5\\).\n\n**Exploring Symmetry in Combinations:**\nHowever, combinations have a property known as symmetry: \\(\\binom{n}{r} = \\binom{n}{n-r}\\). Let's apply this property to find other potential values of \\(k\\):\n\n- Since \\(\\binom{24}{5} = \\binom{24}{24-5} = \\binom{24}{19}\\), I realize there also might be a solution with \\(k = 19\\).\n\n**Summing the Values of \\(k\\):**\nBased on the symmetry property, \\(k\\) can be either \\(5\\) or \\(19\\). Therefore, the sum of all such possible values of \\(k\\) should be:\n\\[\n5 + 19 = 24.\n\\]\n\n**Reflecting on My Approach:**\nInitially, I overlooked the symmetric property of binomial coefficients, which led to my previous oversight. By considering this symmetry, the additional valid \\(k = 19\\) emerged, and the correct sum of all \\(k\\) values is indeed \\( \\boxed{24} \\).\n\nThis solution feels more robust after double-checking the identity's application and ensuring no other oversight. It's always insightful to re-evaluate and use different perspectives on a problem, which can often uncover overlooked details.",

  "ground_truth": "By Pascal's Identity, we have $\\binom{23}{4} + \\binom{23}{5} = \\binom{24}{5}$.  However, we also have $\\binom{24}{5} = \\binom{24}{24-5} = \\binom{24}{19}$.  There are no other values of $k$ such that $\\binom{24}{5} = \\binom{24}{k}$, so the sum of all integers that satisfy the problem is $5+19 = \\boxed{24}$.\n\nChallenge: Is it a coincidence that the answer is 24?"
