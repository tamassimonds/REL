    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. It's important to start by truly understanding what the question is asking. We need to evaluate a product of matrices that have a very specific form, and there appear to be many of them involved. Here's what comes to mind initially:\n\n### First Thoughts\n1. **Recognizing the structure**: Each matrix in the sequence \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & n \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is an upper triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal. This type of matrix often has nice properties when it comes to multiplication.\n   \n2. **Matrix multiplication properties**: Upper triangular matrices with ones on the diagonal are sometimes easier to work with since the product is also upper triangular with ones on the diagonal.\n\n3. **Nature of the problem**: This problem might be similar to problems involving the product of transformations or cumulative effects, such as a series of transformations in geometry or linear algebra.\n\n### Strategy Development\nAlright, I think I have a point to start from:\n\n- **Matrix multiplication pattern**: Let's explore what happens if we multiply a few of these matrices together:\n  - Start small and generalize: we could start by multiplying two matrices, then three, and see if a pattern emerges.\n\n- **Possibility of a closed form**: Given the structure, there might be a simplified result after multiplying them all.\n\n### Step-by-Step Multiplication\nLet's start by multiplying two matrices and see what happens:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & a \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & b \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1\\cdot1 + a\\cdot0 & 1\\cdot b + a\\cdot1 \\\\ 0\\cdot1 + 1\\cdot0 & 0\\cdot b + 1\\cdot1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & a + b \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Insight and Potential Pattern\nBy multiplying two matrices, I ended up with another matrix of the same form, where the new number in the top right is the sum of the numbers in the top right from the original matrices. This suggests that:\n\n- When you multiply these matrices, you just add up the numbers from the top right corner.\n\n### Continuing the Pattern\nNow let's apply this insight to the problem at hand. We're tasked with finding the product of matrices from \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) to \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 99 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\):\n\n- If the pattern holds, when we multiply all these matrices together, we will get:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + 99 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Arithmetic Series\nRecognizing that \\(1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + 99\\) is an arithmetic series:\n\n- This series consists of odd numbers starting from 1 up to 99.\n- I remember that there's a formula for the sum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers, which is \\(n^2\\).\n- The sequence \\(1, 3, 5, \\ldots, 99\\) has a common difference of 2, and the term \\(99\\) can be written as \\(2n - 1\\). Solving for \\(n\\) gives \\(n = 50\\).\n\n### Calculating the Sum\nSince there are 50 terms:\n\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + 99 = 50^2 = 2500.\n\\]\n\n### Final Matrix Product\nThus, the product of all these matrices is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2500 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n### Reflection and Final Thoughts\nThis solution seems to check out with the properties of these matrices. Each step maintained the upper triangular structure and added the values correctly, matching the behaviors we expect from the pattern. The arithmetic series was calculated correctly, too, confirming the final result.\n\nFinal answer: \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2500 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\). I hope my thought process illustrates how approaching problem-solving with a systematic and reflective mindset helps anticipate and address potential issues.",
