    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by first trying to understand it and consider different ways to approach it.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I notice that we are given a diagram with some points on it, and we need to find the slope and y-intercept of the line through points C and D. Immediately, this feels like a geometry problem involving line equations, midpoints, and possibly coordinate geometry.\n\nThe problem mentions that D and E are midpoints, which means we could use this property to find their coordinates. It looks like the problem provides coordinates for A, B, and C, which helps. Since D is the midpoint of AB and E is the midpoint of BC, figuring out their coordinates might be a sensible starting point.\n\n**Coordination and Midpoint Calculations:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Midpoint D:**\n\n   Point A is (0, 6) and point B is (0, 0). D is the midpoint of AB. Let's calculate:\n   \\[\n   D = \\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{0+0}{2}, \\frac{6+0}{2} \\right) = (0, 3)\n   \\]\n   Okay, so D is at (0, 3). This agrees with the given coordinates in the diagram, so that checks out. Good.\n\n2. **Verify the Midpoint E (not directly needed but good to know):**\n\n   Point B is (0, 0) and point C is (8, 0). E is the midpoint of BC:\n   \\[\n   E = \\left( \\frac{0+8}{2}, \\frac{0+0}{2} \\right) = (4, 0)\n   \\]\n   Yup, that works too. E is at (4, 0).\n\n**Slope and y-Intercept of Line CD:**\n\nNow, let's find the equation of the line through points C and D.\n\n3. **Find the Slope of CD:**\n\n   Point C is (8, 0) and point D is (0, 3). The slope \\(m\\) of a line through two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{3 - 0}{0 - 8} = \\frac{3}{-8} = -\\frac{3}{8}\n   \\]\n\n   Hmm, slope seems to be \\(-\\frac{3}{8}\\), which makes sense given the downward slope from C to D.\n\n4. **Find the y-Intercept of Line CD:**\n\n   We can use the point-slope form of the line \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\) with point D (0, 3) which should be convenient:\n   \\[\n   y - 3 = -\\frac{3}{8}(x - 0)\n   \\]\n   Simplify this to get the y-intercept form:\n   \\[\n   y = -\\frac{3}{8}x + 3\n   \\]\n   So, the y-intercept is 3.\n\n**Summing up the Results:**\n\n5. **Add the Slope and y-Intercept:**\n\n   The problem asks for the sum of the slope and the y-intercept:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = -\\frac{3}{8} + 3\n   \\]\n\n   To make the addition clear:\n   Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 8: \\(3 = \\frac{24}{8}\\).\n\n   Thus:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = -\\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{24}{8} = \\frac{21}{8}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Check and Reflection:**\n\nThis result seems consistent with the approaches and checks I've done along the way. The line through C and D indeed has a slope of \\(-\\frac{3}{8}\\) and a y-intercept of 3, after calculating using different points and verifying the midpoints. The calculations seem correct, and I have verified each step.\n\nThe final answer is that the sum of the slope and the y-intercept of the line through points C and D is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{21}{8}}\\).",
