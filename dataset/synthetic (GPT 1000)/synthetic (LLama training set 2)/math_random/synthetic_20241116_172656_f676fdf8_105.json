    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem.\n\n**First Thoughts**  \nThe question is asking for the sum of the whole-number factors of 24. At first glance, I remember that finding factors means identifying numbers that divide 24 without a remainder. I vaguely recall doing similar problems where factors were involved. Let me try listing out the factors and see what happens.\n\n**Brainstorming and Strategies**  \nA few strategies pop into my head:  \n1. List out all the factors one by one manually.  \n2. Use prime factorization to break 24 into factors and figure it out from there.  \n3. Check (numerically or computationally) every number up to 24 to see if it divides evenly.\n\nLet's start with the first strategy to see how it goes and then evaluate if it makes sense to use another one.\n\n**Listing Factors**  \nI know that when finding factors, they often come in pairs. For 24, I'll start with 1, since 1 is a factor of every number.\n\n- 1 is a factor. I know \\(1 \\times 24 = 24\\) \n- 2 is a factor since \\(24 \\div 2 = 12\\), so both 2 and 12 are factors.\n- 3 is also a factor because \\(24 \\div 3 = 8\\), meaning 3 and 8 are factors.\n- 4 as well since \\(24 \\div 4 = 6\\), so 4 and 6 are factors.\n- 5 is not a factor since \\(24 \\div 5\\) isn\u2019t an integer.\n- 6 is a factor, but it's already listed with 4.\n\nI should stop checking at 6, because checking any higher means I'll just be repeating factors (pairing with numbers less than 6).\n\n**Check**  \nAlright, I collected all the factors and ended up with: \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\\). Quick mental check: Does this list make sense? Yes, because 6 factors in pairs (1&24, 2&12, 3&8, and 4&6), and I listed each number that divides 24 without remainder. Moving forward to the next step.\n\n**Calculating the Sum**  \nQuick addition to find the sum of these factors:\n\\[1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 24\\]\n\n1. Start by adding smaller numbers:  \n   \\(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\\)  \n2. Add \\(4\\):  \n   \\(6 + 4 = 10\\)  \n3. Add \\(6\\):  \n   \\(10 + 6 = 16\\)  \n4. Add \\(8\\):  \n   \\(16 + 8 = 24\\)  \n5. Add \\(12\\):  \n   \\(24 + 12 = 36\\)  \n6. Finally, add \\(24\\):  \n   \\(36 + 24 = 60\\)  \n\n**Reflection**  \nIs it accurate? To verify: I added step by step. It feels right since I maintained clarity throughout. I expect 60 to be the final answer. My thought process seems consistent with a standard approach for solving this type of problem.\n\nSo, the sum of all whole-number factors of 24 is \\(60\\).",
