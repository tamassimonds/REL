    "working_out": "Alright, let's begin brainstorming and breaking down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nFirst, I'm given two lines in 3D space. One is defined as:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nAnd the other is:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + u \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nI need to determine for which values of \\( a \\) these lines are skew. Skew lines are lines that are neither parallel nor intersecting.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Strategies\n\n#### Parallel Check\nTo be parallel, the direction vectors of the lines must be scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and the second line is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\). I can check if there exists a scalar \\(k\\) such that:\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = k \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nHmm, already this doesn't seem likely because none of these equations directly yield the same scalar \\(k\\). More checking might just confirm that the lines are not parallel for any \\( a \\).\n\n#### Intersection Check\nTwo lines intersect if there exist parameters \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) such that both parameterized vector equations equal each other:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 + 2t \\\\ 2 + 3t \\\\ a + 4t \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 + 5u \\\\ 1 + 2u \\\\ 0 + 1u \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSolving these equations will tell us if, and for which \\( a \\), the lines intersect:\n\\[ \n1 + 2t = 4 + 5u \\quad \\text{(1)} \n\\]\n\\[ \n2 + 3t = 1 + 2u \\quad \\text{(2)} \n\\]\n\\[ \na + 4t = u \\quad \\text{(3)} \n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solving the System of Equations\n\nLet's work through these one by one. First, I'll use equations (1) and (2):\n\n1. Rearrange (1): \\(2t - 5u = 3 \\)\n2. Rearrange (2): \\(3t - 2u = -1\\)\n\nHmm, now I have a system of linear equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases} \n2t - 5u = 3 \\\\\n3t - 2u = -1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nI should try solving these using elimination or substitution. \n\n#### Solving by Elimination:\n\nMultiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 2 to eliminate \\( t \\):\n\n1. \\( 6t - 15u = 9 \\)\n2. \\( 6t - 4u = -2 \\)\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first:\n\\[ \n-15u + 4u = 9 + 2 \n\\]\n\\[ \n-11u = 11 \\Rightarrow u = -1\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( u = -1 \\) back into one of the equations to find \\( t \\). Using \\( 2t - 5(-1) = 3 \\):\n\\[ \n2t + 5 = 3 \\Rightarrow 2t = -2 \\Rightarrow t = -1\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Check Consistency with (3)\n\nOkay, now substitute \\( t = -1 \\) and \\( u = -1 \\) back into equation (3):\n\\[ \na + 4(-1) = -1 \n\\]\n\\[ \na - 4 = -1 \\Rightarrow a = 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe lines intersect for \\( a = 3 \\), so for the lines to be skew, \\( a \\) must not be 3.\n\n**Check**: Here, \\( t = -1 \\) and \\( u = -1 \\) made all the original equations consistent for \\( a = 3 \\). Therefore, the original approach and thinking are correct. \n\nThe solution is:\n\\[ a \\neq 3 \\]\n\nThis was a good step-by-step process to solving the problem. It involved parallel checks, intersection checks, solving equations, back substituting, and verifying results. The method confirms that for the lines to be skew, they should neither intersect nor be parallel, leading to \\( a \\neq 3 \\).",

Equating the vectors for the two lines, and comparing components, we obtain the system of equations\n\\begin{align*}\n1 + 2t &= 4 + 5u, \\\\\n2 + 3t &= 1 + 2u, \\\\\na + 4t &= u.\n\\end{align*}Solving, we find $t = -1,$ $u = -1,$ and $a = 3.$\n\nTherefore, the two lines are skew for $a \\neq 3,$ or $a \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,3) \\cup (3,\\infty)}.$"
