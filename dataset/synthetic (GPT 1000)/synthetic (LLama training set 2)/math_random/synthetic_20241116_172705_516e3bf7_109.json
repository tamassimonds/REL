    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into the problem of finding the smallest possible perimeter of a triangle with consecutive integer side lengths. At first, this problem seems straightforward, but it's important to remember the properties and inequalities that govern triangles.\n\n**Understanding the Question:**\nThe problem is asking for the \"smallest possible perimeter\" of a triangle with side lengths as consecutive integers. Consecutive integers are numbers like 1, 2, 3 or 4, 5, 6 - basically, numbers that follow each other in sequence without gaps. The main condition is that these form a valid triangle, so this invokes the triangle inequality theorem.\n\n**Triangle Inequality Theorem:**\nThe theorem states that for any triangle with sides \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), the following must hold true:\n1. \\( a + b > c \\)\n2. \\( a + c > b \\)\n3. \\( b + c > a \\)\n\nGiven \\( a \\), \\( a+1 \\), and \\( a+2 \\) are consecutive integers, these must satisfy the above inequalities.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n1. The triangle inequality conditions will help check the feasibility of these side lengths. \n2. Finding the smallest numbers might be tricky since the smallest positive integers need to satisfy the triangle inequality.\n3. A simple test with small integers could get us started and guide us to pattern recognition.\n\n**Testing Small Values:**\nLet's test this with the smallest consecutive integer sets to understand how it plays out with the triangle inequality:\n\n1. **Testing \\( a=1 \\), \\( b=2 \\), \\( c=3 \\):**\n   - Checking the inequalities:\n     - \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\) (not greater) \u2192 Violates \\( a + b > c \\)\n   - This doesn\u2019t form a triangle.\n\n2. **Try \\( a=2 \\), \\( b=3 \\), \\( c=4 \\):**\n   - Checking the inequalities:\n     - \\( 2 + 3 = 5 \\) which is greater than 4.\n     - \\( 2 + 4 = 6 \\) which is greater than 3.\n     - \\( 3 + 4 = 7 \\) which is greater than 2.\n   - All conditions hold.\n\nHere, 2, 3, and 4 form a valid triangle. The perimeter is \\( 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis approach of verifying with small numbers seems promising. Since 1, 2, 3 didn\u2019t work due to not satisfying the triangle inequality, the next possible set is 2, 3, 4.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- We tried other sets of smaller numbers like 1, 2, 3 and those failed to meet the criteria.\n- The smallest valid set where all inequalities hold is indeed 2, 3, and 4 which gives a sum of 9.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy building from foundational triangle rules and iterating from the smallest values upwards, we found that the side-lengths 2, 3, 4 form the smallest perimeter of 9 for a triangle with consecutive integer measures. This fits all the imposed conditions by the problem statement. \n\nThat was a logical and straightforward exploration, and I can confidently say that the perimeter of 9 is indeed the smallest possible for such a triangle!",

  "ground_truth": "The smallest such triangle has lengths 1, 2, and 3. However, this triangle doesn't work since the sum of any two side lengths must be greater than the third side length (by the Triangle Inequality). The next smallest triangle has lengths 2, 3, and 4, which works. Thus, the smallest possible perimeter is $2+3+4=\\boxed{9}$ units."
