    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like sitting down with a piece of paper and working through it. \n\n### First Impressions and Initial Thoughts:\n- **Problem Statement**: We have a number in base six, \\(53_6\\), and we need to find a base \\(b\\) such that the same number is represented as \\(113_b\\). This involves converting the numbers from one base to another and solving for \\(b\\).\n\n- **What do we know?**:\n  - The base six number \\(53_6\\) needs to be converted to base ten first, as base ten is universal and might help me compare it with the number in another base \\(b\\).\n  - Once in base ten, I'll compare it with \\(113_b\\) converted to base ten, as \\(113_b\\) needs to be interpreted as a base \\(b\\) number.\n\n- **Initial Strategy**:\n  - Convert \\(53_6\\) to a base ten number.\n  - Convert \\(113_b\\) to a base ten number expression.\n  - Equate both base ten expressions and solve for \\(b\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Conversion:\n\n#### Step 1: Convert \\(53_6\\) to Base Ten\n- Convert each digit of \\(53_6\\) using base six powers:\n  \\[\n  53_6 = 5 \\cdot 6^1 + 3 \\cdot 6^0\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 5 \\cdot 6 + 3 \\cdot 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 30 + 3 = 33_{10}\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick Check**: Let me run through that math quickly again to make sure it's right:\n  - \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\)\n  - \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\)\n  - \\(30 + 3 = 33\\). Yes, that checks out. So, \\(53_6 = 33_{10}\\).\n\n#### Step 2: Interpret \\(113_b\\) as a Base Ten Number\n- Consider \\(113_b\\) as:\n  \\[\n  113_b = 1 \\cdot b^2 + 1 \\cdot b^1 + 3 \\cdot b^0\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = 1 \\cdot b^2 + 1 \\cdot b + 3\n  \\]\n\n#### Step 3: Equate and Solve for \\(b\\)\n- Now, equate both expressions in base ten:\n  \\[\n  33 = b^2 + b + 3\n  \\]\n- Rearrange into a standard quadratic equation form:\n  \\[\n  b^2 + b + 3 = 33\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  b^2 + b - 30 = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **Quick reflection**: This involves solving a quadratic equation. Let me calculate the solution for \\(b\\).\n\n#### Step 4: Solve the Quadratic Equation\n- **Formula**: Use the quadratic formula \\(b = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\\) where \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 1\\), \\(C = -30\\).\n  \\[\n  b = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-30)}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 120}}{2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{121}}{2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = \\frac{-1 \\pm 11}{2}\n  \\]\n\n- **Solution Check**: Calculate the values:\n  - \\(b = \\frac{-1 + 11}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\\) (positive solution)\n  - \\(b = \\frac{-1 - 11}{2} = \\frac{-12}{2} = -6\\) (not viable, since base \\(b\\) must be positive)\n\n- **Reflection**: I found \\(b = 5\\) is the only viable solution. This feels correct as the positive value makes logical sense for a base.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe positive value for \\(b\\) such that \\(113_b\\) is equal to \\(53_6\\) is \\(b = 5\\).\n\n- **Afterthoughts**: It's always good to quickly check whether substituting back produces the expected result, but given the algebra and basic correctness checks I undertook earlier, this solution should hold. If I had more doubts, I might double-check by recomputing values for sample digits in base \\(b\\). But this path sounds solid.",

  "ground_truth": "First, we have $$53_6=5\\cdot6^1+3\\cdot6^0=33_{10}.$$ and  $$113_b=1\\cdot b^2+1\\cdot b^1+3\\cdot b^0=(b^2+b+3)_{10}.$$ Therefore, we must have $b^2+b+3=33$, so $b^2+b-30=0$. Factoring we have $(b-5)(b+6)=0$. Thus, $b=5$ or $b=-6$. The positive value is $b=\\boxed{5}$."
