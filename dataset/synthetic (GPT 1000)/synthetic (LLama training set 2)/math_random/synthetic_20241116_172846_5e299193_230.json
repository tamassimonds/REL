    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this and start brainstorming some initial thoughts.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst, we have two equations given:\n1. \\( a + 4b = 33 \\)\n2. \\( 6a + 3b = 51 \\)\n\nThe goal is to find the value of \\( a + b \\). We have two equations with two variables, so it\u2019s possible to solve this system to find the values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nLooking at the equations, my first thought is that this resembles a problem I\u2019ve encountered before - solving systems of linear equations, possibly using substitution or elimination. But which strategy would be more efficient here? Since one equation is a simple sum of variables and the other is a linear combination, elimination might be more straightforward. Let's explore different strategies briefly.\n\n### Exploring Different Strategies\n\n#### Strategy 1: Substitution\nI could solve the first equation for one variable (say \\( a = 33 - 4b \\)) and then substitute it into the second equation. But, given the coefficients, that might get a bit messy quickly.\n\n#### Strategy 2: Elimination\nSince the coefficients and constants look nice, elimination might work well here. I can scale and cancel terms more easily.\n\nI'll go with elimination for now since it seems easier to handle. But if it doesn't work out as expected, I can switch back to substitution.\n\n### Attempting Elimination Method\n\n1. **Align the Equations:**\n   - \\( a + 4b = 33 \\)  \\[ (1) \\]\n   - \\( 6a + 3b = 51 \\)  \\[ (2) \\]\n\n2. **Eliminate \\( a \\):**\n   - Multiply Equation (1) by 6 to align \\( a \\) coefficients:\n     \\[\n     6a + 24b = 198\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtract Equation (2) from the transformed Equation (1):**\n   - \\((6a + 24b) - (6a + 3b) = 198 - 51\\)\n   - Simplifying gives:\n     \\[\n     21b = 147\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( b \\):**\n   - Divide by 21:\n     \\[\n     b = \\frac{147}{21} = 7\n     \\]\n\n### Verifying Work So Far\nLet me quickly check if \\( b = 7 \\) makes sense. Substitute back into the original Equation (1) to see:\n  \\[\n  a + 4(7) = 33 \\Rightarrow a + 28 = 33 \\Rightarrow a = 5\n  \\]\n\nThat looks consistent. The calculation holds up. Let's verify once more with Equation (2) to be thorough:\n  \\[\n  6a + 3b = 51 \\Rightarrow 6(5) + 3(7) = 30 + 21 = 51\n  \\]\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Final Calculation: \\( a + b \\)\n\nWith \\( a = 5 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\):\n- \\( a + b = 5 + 7 = 12 \\)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe value of \\( a + b \\) is \\( 12 \\). This seemed to flow well once the right strategy was chosen, and the calculations were verified without any apparent mistakes. Reflecting on the process, the elimination method was efficient given the coefficients. If needed, another approach could have been checked too, but this solution is consistent.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the problem asks for $a+b$, we look for a way to isolate $a+b$ from the given equations.\n\n\nNotice that $a + 6a = 7a$ and $4b + 3b = 7b$. This gives us the key to isolating $a + b$. We simply add the two equations together:  \\begin{align*}\n7a + 7b &= 84 \\\\\n7(a + b) &= 84 \\\\\na + b &= \\frac{84}{7} \\\\\na + b &= \\boxed{12}\n\\end{align*}"
