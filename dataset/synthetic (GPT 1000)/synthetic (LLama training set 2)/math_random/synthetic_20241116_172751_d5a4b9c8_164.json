    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into solving this problem and take it step-by-step.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\nWhen I first look at the problem of finding the maximum value of the function \\( f(x) = -x^2 - 6x + 12 \\), it reminds me of finding the vertex of a quadratic function. This is because the function is a quadratic equation in standard form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\n### Strategy Brainstorming\n\n1. **Identify the Form**: The given function \\( -x^2 - 6x + 12 \\) is a downward-opening parabola because the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is negative.\n\n2. **Vertex of a Parabola**: The maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function occurs at its vertex. Since this parabola opens downwards, its vertex will give the maximum value.\n\n3. **Vertex Formula**: For a quadratic function \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by the formula \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\n- Wait, I should check if \\( b \\) and \\( a \\) are correct. Here, \\( a = -1 \\) and \\( b = -6 \\).\n\n4. **Calculations**: Let\u2019s apply this formula:\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{-6}{2 \\times -1} = -\\frac{-6}{-2} = 3\n\\]\n\nOops, hold on. I think I swapped a sign here. Let's calculate that again carefully:\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{-6}{2 \\times -1} = \\frac{6}{-2} = -3\n\\]\n\n### Verify the X-Coordinate of Vertex\n\n- The calculation yields \\( x = -3 \\), which seems right. Double-check: \\(-\\frac{-6}{-2}\\) does indeed simplify to \\( -3 \\).\n\n### Find the Maximum Value\n\nNow that we have the x-coordinate of the vertex, we need to find the function's value at this point to confirm the maximum value:\n\n\\[\nf(-3) = -(-3)^2 - 6(-3) + 12\n\\]\n\n- Calculate \\( (-3)^2 = 9 \\)\n- So, the equation becomes:\n\\[\nf(-3) = -9 + 18 + 12\n\\]\n\n- Breaking it into steps:\n  - First compute \\(-9 + 18 = 9\\)\n  - Then add \\(12\\), which gives \\(9 + 12 = 21\\)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe maximum value of the function is \\(21\\) when \\(x = -3\\).\n\n### Reflection\n\n- I feel confident in the result because the more I go over it, the vertex method applies properly given the form of the parabola.\n- The process of finding \\(-3\\) through \\(-\\frac{-6}{2(-1)}\\) and then computing \\(f(-3)\\) checks out.\n- I initially confused the sign, but recalculating it fixed the error.\n\nOverall, this method seems both complete and straightforward for this type of problem. The maximum value is indeed \\(21\\) at \\(x = -3\\). Moving on, if anyone asks about checking values around -3 itself, it should indeed yield lower outputs since the parabola peaks at this vertex.",

  "ground_truth": "We start by completing the square: \\begin{align*}\n-x^2 -6x +12 &= -(x^2 + 6x) + 12\\\\ &= -(x^2 + 6x + (6/2)^2 - (6/2)^2) + 12\\\\ &= -((x+3)^2 -3^2) + 12 \\\\&= -(x+3)^2 +3^2 + 12 \\\\&= -(x+3)^2 + 21.\\end{align*}Since the square of a real number is at least 0, we have $(x+3)^2\\ge 0$, so $-(x+3)^2 \\le 0$.  Therefore, $-(x+3)^2 + 21$ is at most 21.  Since $(x+3)^2 =0$ when $x=-3$, this maximum of $21$ is achieved when $x= \\boxed{-3}$."
