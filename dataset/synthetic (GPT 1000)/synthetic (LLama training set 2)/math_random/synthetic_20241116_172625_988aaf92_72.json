    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into solving the problem of finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of 40 and 48. I'll start by brainstorming some strategies that could be useful.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- Finding the greatest common factor of two numbers involves identifying the largest number that divides both without leaving a remainder.\n- Two strategies come to mind: \n  1. Listing all the factors of each number and finding the highest common one.\n  2. Using the prime factorization method to decompose each number into its prime factors and then find the common factors.\n- There's also the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient for larger numbers, but let's start simple since the numbers here aren't too large.\n\n**Strategy 1: Listing Factors**\n- Let's try listing the factors of each number.\n\nFactors of 40: \n1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40\n\nFactors of 48:\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48\n\n- Now let's identify the common factors from these lists.\n  - Common factors are 1, 2, 4, 8.\n\n- The greatest of these is 8.\n\nHmm, this seems correct, but let's verify it in another way to be sure.\n\n**Strategy 2: Prime Factorization**\n- Next, let's decompose both numbers into their prime factors to assure accuracy.\n\nPrime factorization of 40:\n- 40 can be divided by 2 to get 20,\n- 20 can be divided by 2 to get 10,\n- 10 can be divided by 2 to get 5,\n- 5 is a prime number.\n- Thus, 40 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 (or \\(2^3 \\times 5\\)).\n\nPrime factorization of 48:\n- 48 divided by 2 gives 24,\n- 24 divided by 2 gives 12,\n- 12 divided by 2 gives 6,\n- 6 divided by 2 gives 3,\n- 3 is a prime number.\n- So, 48 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 (or \\(2^4 \\times 3\\)).\n\n- Let's find the common prime factors now.\n  - Common prime factors: 2, 2, 2 (or \\(2^3\\)).\n\n- Multiplying the common prime factors: \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\\).\n\n**Verification using Euclidean Algorithm:**\n- As an additional check, let's apply the Euclidean algorithm, which uses the principle that the GCF of two numbers also divides their difference.\n\nStep 1: Divide 48 by 40, remainder is 8.\nStep 2: Divide 40 by 8, remainder is 0.\n\n- Once the remainder reaches 0, the divisor (8 in this step) is the GCF.\n\n**Reflection and Conclusion:**\n- All approaches (listing factors, prime factorization, and Euclidean algorithm) consistently found the GCF to be 8.\n- It seems correct and aligns well with each method.\n\nThus, the greatest common factor of 40 and 48 is 8.",

  "ground_truth": "$40=2^3\\cdot5$ and $48=2^4\\cdot3$. The prime factorization of their greatest common factor cannot contain any other primes besides 2 raised to no more than the 3rd power, otherwise it would not be a factor of both numbers. Thus, their GCF is $2^3=\\boxed{8}$."
