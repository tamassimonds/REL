To do this, we'll need to first find the prime factorization of 990. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nWhen I first see a problem about prime factorization, it immediately makes me think about breaking the number down into smaller components. A number like 990 seems pretty large, but it's manageable because I know prime factorization is a process that can be done step by step. I think starting with the smallest prime numbers is a good approach.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. Start with the smallest primes and work upward.\n2. Check divisibility by small primes like 2, 3, 5, 7 and so on.\n3. Look for patterns or obvious factors.\n\n### Step 1: Dividing by Smallest Primes\n\n**First thoughts:** To start, I'll test 990 with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n- 990 is even, so it's divisible by 2.\n\nCalculating: \n\\[ \\frac{990}{2} = 495 \\]\n\n**Next step:** Now we have 495. Let's repeat the process with 495.\n\n495 is not even, so it's not divisible by 2. Let's try the next smallest prime, which is 3.\n\n**Checking divisibility by 3:**\n- Sum of digits of 495 is \\( 4 + 9 + 5 = 18 \\), which is divisible by 3.\n\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\frac{495}{3} = 165 \\]\n\n**Next step:** Now we have 165. We'll check it next with 3 again because of its small sum of digits: \n- Sum of digits of 165 is \\( 1 + 6 + 5 = 12 \\), which is divisible by 3.\n\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\frac{165}{3} = 55 \\]\n\n**Thinking:** 55 is still not prime. Let's test it with the next smallest prime after 3, which is 5. \n\n**Checking divisibility by 5:**\n- 55 ends in a 5, so it's divisible by 5.\n\nCalculating:\n\\[ \\frac{55}{5} = 11 \\]\n\n**Reflecting:** Now we have 11, which appears to be a prime number.\n\n### Step 2: Confirm and Reflect\n\nAt this stage, we have the number fully factorized. We've divided 990 down into small components through systematic checks.\n- The prime factors we've discovered are: 2, 3, 3, 5, 11.\n\n**Double-checking for mistakes**:\n- Multiplying back, \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 11 = 990 \\).\n\nSeems everything checks out!\n\n### Final Step: Identify Largest and Smallest Prime Factors\n\n**Smallest prime factor:** Looked at the factor list (2, 3, 3, 5, 11), the smallest is 2.\n\n**Largest prime factor:** Also looking at that list, the largest is 11.\n\n### Summation and Conclusion\n\nFinally, let's calculate the sum of the smallest and largest prime factors:\n\\[ 2 + 11 = 13 \\]\n\n**And there we have it!** After working through the problem step by step, the sum of the largest and smallest prime factors of 990 is 13.\n\nThis problem felt straightforward once broken into smaller pieces, and I'm relieved my calculations held up after cross-checking. I think a systematic approach will always benefit problems like these.",
