    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\n- Upon first glance, the equation \\( f(xy) = xf(y) \\) is kind of unusual, but it feels like I've encountered similar functional equations before. There's symmetry in functional equations that often leads to discovering specific forms or properties of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n- The given \\( f(1) = 25 \\) is a key piece of information. This might suggest something about the behavior of \\( f(x) \\) when \\( x = 1 \\) is involved, since 1 is the multiplicative identity.\n\n- The ultimate goal is to find \\( f(79) \\).\n\n### Initial Exploration\n\n1. **Substituting \\( y = 1 \\):**\n\n   Let's set \\( y = 1 \\) in the functional equation. This yields:\n\n   \\[\n   f(x \\cdot 1) = x \\cdot f(1) \\Rightarrow f(x) = x \\cdot 25\n   \\]\n\n   This suggests a potential simplest form: \\( f(x) = 25x \\).\n\n2. **Verifying our Candidate Solution:**\n\n   If \\( f(x) = 25x \\), substitute back into the original functional equation to verify consistency:\n\n   \\[\n   f(xy) = 25(xy) = 25x \\cdot y \\quad \\text{and} \\quad xf(y) = x \\cdot 25y = 25xy\n   \\]\n\n   These are equal, indicating that my candidate solution satisfies the functional equation. Nice!\n\n3. **Checking the Given Condition:**\n\n   - We know \\( f(1) = 25 \\), so checking our candidate \\( f(x) = 25x \\) for \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n     \\[\n     f(1) = 25 \\times 1 = 25\n     \\]\n\n   This perfectly matches the given condition.\n\n### Solving for \\( f(79) \\)\n\nWith \\( f(x) = 25x \\) confirmed as consistent and correct for the given conditions and functional equation, calculating \\( f(79) \\) is straightforward:\n\n\\[\nf(79) = 25 \\times 79 = 1975\n\\]\n\n### Final Check\n\n- Re-discussing everything: Is there any assumption I made that could have been a misstep? Not in this case, as verifying with the functional equation tied back correctly into all constraints.\n  \n- The answer doesn't feel too large or small for functions of this linear sort when considering numbers like 25 and 79.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGetting \\( f(x) = 25x \\) perfectly aligns with every requirement laid out. The solution should be correct:\n\n\\[ f(79) = 1975 \\]\n\nThis process feels solid to me as it relied on directly teasing out the form naturally from the functional equation, confirming and cross-referencing, and then applying to the specific case.",
