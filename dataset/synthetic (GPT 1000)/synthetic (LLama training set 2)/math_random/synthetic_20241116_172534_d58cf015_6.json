    "working_out": "Alright, let's begin by breaking down the problem step by step. We are given a rectangle with a specific length, width, and perimeter, and we need to find the ratio of its width to its length. The information seems fairly straightforward, but let's go through it carefully to ensure we capture everything correctly.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nFirst, let's figure out what we know:\n- The rectangle's length is given as \\(8\\).\n- The perimeter of the rectangle is \\(24\\).\n- The width of the rectangle is given as \\(w\\).\n\nThe problem is asking for the ratio \\(w:8\\) in its simplest form.\n\n### Step 2: Recall Rectangle Perimeter Formula\nThe formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:\n\\[\nP = 2(l + w)\n\\]\nPlugging in the values we know:\n\\[\n24 = 2(8 + w)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for the Width \\(w\\)\nNow let's solve the equation for \\(w\\):\n\n1. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   24 = 2 \\times (8 + w)\n   \\]\n2. Divide both sides by 2 to isolate the term inside the parentheses:\n   \\[\n   12 = 8 + w\n   \\]\n3. Subtract \\(8\\) from both sides to solve for \\(w\\):\n   \\[\n   w = 4\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Ratio of Width to Length\nNow that we know \\(w = 4\\), we need to find the ratio of width to length:\n- Width \\(w = 4\\)\n- Length \\(l = 8\\)\n\nThe ratio \\(w:l\\) is:\n\\[\nw : l = 4 : 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplify the Ratio\nTo simplify the ratio, we find the greatest common divider (GCD) of 4 and 8, which is 4.\n\nDivide both parts of the ratio by 4:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{4} : \\frac{8}{4} = 1 : 2\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Reflect and Double-Check\n- Let's quickly check our calculation for the width \\(w\\). If the width is 4 and the length is 8, the perimeter indeed is:\n  \\[\n  2(4 + 8) = 2 \\times 12 = 24\n  \\]\n  This checks out with the perimeter given in the problem.\n\n- Double-check the ratio simplification. The ratio \\(4 : 8\\) simplifies correctly to \\(1 : 2\\), since both numbers were divided by their GCD, 4.\n\nGiven these careful checks, our answer seems consistent and correct with the information provided. \n\n### Final Answer\nThe ratio of the width to the length is \\(1 : 2\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Since the rectangle has width $w$, length 8, and perimeter 24, then $2w+2(8)=24$ or $2w+16=24$ or $2w=8$ or $w=4$. Therefore, the ratio of the width to the length is $4 : 8 = \\boxed{1 : 2}$."
