    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem. The goal is to find all possible values for \\(\\angle A\\) when \\(AO = AH\\) in triangle \\(ABC\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\n#### Understanding the Question\n- **Key Elements:**\n  - \\(O\\) is the circumcenter.\n  - \\(H\\) is the orthocenter.\n  - \\(AO = AH\\).\n\n- **Known Properties:**\n  - \\(O\\) is equidistant from all vertices of the triangle.\n  - \\(H\\) is the intersection of the altitudes.\n  - In specific triangle configurations, unique properties about distances between special points become evident. For example, properties in equilateral triangles or right triangles might simplify this problem.\n\n- **Consider Exploring:**\n  - Properties of special triangles, like equilateral or isosceles.\n  - Relationships between geometric centers: circumcenter \\(O\\), orthocenter \\(H\\).\n\n#### Brainstorming Strategies\n1. **Consider Special Cases:**\n   - Equilateral triangle: All angles are 60\u00b0.\n   - Right triangle: One angle is 90\u00b0.\n   \n2. **Use Known Triangle Center Relationships:**\n   - Euler line relationships: \\(O\\), \\(G\\) (centroid), \\(H\\) lie on a line.\n\n3. **Look for Symmetric Arguments:**\n   - Isosceles triangle properties or symmetry arguments might simplify calculations.\n\n4. **Simplify the Condition \\(AO = AH\\):**\n   - Transforming into a geometric argument or known relation that can help.\n\n### Working Through the Problem\n\n1. **Special Case: Equilateral Triangle**  \n   - In an equilateral triangle, all central points \\(O\\), \\(G\\), and \\(H\\) coincide.\n   - This configuration naturally gives \\(AO = AH\\) since they coincide at the same point.\n   - Thus, one possible value of \\(\\angle A\\) is \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Approach with Right Triangles**  \n   - In an isosceles right triangle, \\(AO\\) could equal \\(AH\\) due to symmetry and specific base angle properties.\n   - Investigate if this configuration would naturally lead to \\(AO = AH\\).\n   - Checking the case where angles relate in a classic \\(45^\\circ\\)-\\(45^\\circ\\)-\\(90^\\circ\\) triangle.\n\n3. **Using Euler Line Properties**  \n   - In a non-equilateral triangle, properties regarding distances between \\(O\\) and \\(H\\) usually relate through the centroid \\(G\\) with a known equation: \\(OH = 3OG\\).\n   - Calculating specific angle \\(\\angle A\\) under known configurations where relationship ratios would equate.\n\n4. **General Cases and Calculations**  \n   - By the geometry of triangle centers, could there be another result that would satisfy \\(AO = AH\\)?\n   - Since in general, \\(OH = 2R \\cos A\\), reflecting on how this could equal \\(AO = R\\).\n   - This would generate equations based on trigonometric identities which may constrain \\(\\angle A\\).\n\n### Checking and Reflection\n\n- **Re-examine Special Angles**  \n  - From known geometric relationships and previous solutions:\n    - Equilateral triangle: \\(\\angle A = 60^\\circ\\).\n    - Potential symmetry in isosceles configurations may not yield another distinct \\(\\angle A\\) than already examined.\n \n- **Double-check Equations**  \n  - Specifically reconsider any relationship that might implicitly define the equality \\(AO = AH\\) resulting from symmetric triangle properties.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter examining potential geometric configurations and relationships, the viable unique angle solution that fits \\(AO = AH\\) consistently throughout is when the triangle is equilateral:\n\n- **\\(\\angle A = 60^\\circ\\) is the singular solution**.\n\nThis solution holds through analysis of specialized triangle configurations and general relational properties intrinsic to the triangle's points of concurrency.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my initial analysis. Let's re-examine the problem with a fresh perspective and try to integrate a more comprehensive solution. The user request is to find all possible values of \\(\\angle A\\) when \\(AO = AH\\) in triangle \\(ABC\\).\n\n### Initial Steps: Reassessing the Situation\n\nGiven:\n- \\(O\\) is the circumcenter.\n- \\(H\\) is the orthocenter.\n- \\(AO = AH\\).\n\nI initially considered special triangles, such as equilateral triangles, where all angles are \\(60^\\circ\\). This seemed to fit since the centers coincide, making \\(AO = AH\\) naturally. However, I must explore other possibilities that I initially overlooked.\n\n### Rechecking with the Extended Law of Sines\n\nLet's follow through considering the hint: \\(AH^2 = 4R^2 - a^2\\) and \\(AO^2 = R^2\\).\n\nIf:\n\\[ 4R^2 - a^2 = R^2 \\]\nThen:\n\\[ a^2 = 3R^2 \\]\nSo:\n\\[ a = R\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nNow, using the Extended Law of Sines:\n\\[ \\frac{a}{\\sin A} = 2R \\]\nSubstitute in the expression for \\(a\\):\n\\[ \\frac{R\\sqrt{3}}{\\sin A} = 2R \\]\nThus:\n\\[ \\sin A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\]\n\n### Evaluating \\(\\angle A\\)\n\nFrom \\(\\sin A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), the angles that satisfy this equation are:\n- \\(\\angle A = 60^\\circ\\)\n- \\(\\angle A = 120^\\circ\\)\n\n### Reflection and Conclusion\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, \\(\\angle A = 60^\\circ\\), indeed leads \\(AO\\) to equal \\(AH\\), which was the initial solution. However, it's also essential to recognize the potential for another configuration due to the trigonometric identity, \\(\\sin A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the possible values for \\(\\angle A\\) are \\(\\boxed{60^\\circ, 120^\\circ}\\). These outcomes demonstrate the importance of considering additional geometric properties and trigonometric identities in solving such problems. The re-examination and integration of additional concepts has yielded the correct and comprehensive solution.",
