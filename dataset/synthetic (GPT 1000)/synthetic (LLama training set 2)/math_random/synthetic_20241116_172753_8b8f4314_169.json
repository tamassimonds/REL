    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nMy initial reaction is that this problem involves expanding a polynomial expression, specifically \\( (p(x))^3 \\), where \\( p(x) = x^4 - 3x + 2 \\). The specific goal is to identify the coefficient of the \\( x^3 \\) term in the expanded polynomial. \n\nI\u2019m thinking about utilizing the binomial theorem or multinomial expansion here, as expanding a polynomial raised to a power often involves these kinds of expansion techniques. However, it doesn't fit neatly because it's not a simple binomial since \\( p(x) \\) has more than two terms.\n\n**Exploration of Strategies:**\n\n1. **Full Expansion Attempt:** One strategy is to fully expand \\( (p(x))^3 \\) and extract the \\( x^3 \\) term. This feels daunting due to the potential complexity and the number of terms I might encounter, but it could directly provide an answer.\n\n2. **Use of Symmetry and Identification:** Another idea is using the pattern within \\( p(x) \\) itself, knowing it's symmetric around the x-axis for terms like \\( x^4 \\), and focusing only on terms that might contribute to \\( x^3 \\).\n\n3. **Combination Approach:** Spot any obvious ways to directly relate smaller expansions or specific term contributions without fully expanding everything.\n\n**Let's Start with Full Expansion but Focused:**\n\nWe need to find:\n\\[ (x^4 - 3x + 2)^3. \\]\n\nFocusing initially: \nI don\u2019t need everything. I am just interested in contributions to the \\( x^3 \\) term.\n\n**Crucial Step \u2013 Think of Contributing Factors:**\n\n1. **Possible Interactions:**\n   - The terms that need to interact and give \\( x^3 \\) after the complete expansion include combinations of:\n     - \\( x^4, -3x, \\) and \\( 2 \\).\n\n2. **Zero Contribution from \\( x^4 \\):** Because \\( x^4 \\) contributes powers exceeding \\( x^3 \\) even if simply multiplied by itself. Hence, \\( (x^4)^3 \\) is irrelevant by itself.\n\n3. **Contributions from other terms:**\n   - Consider smaller combinations involving the constant terms or their small powers.\n   - Specifically focus on \\( (-3x)^3 \\) which simplifies directly to give \\( -27x^3 \\).\n\n4. **Cross Contributions:**\n   - I need \\( x \\cdot x \\cdot x^2 \\), but this is impossible with available terms.\n   - With constant \\( 2 \\), investigate \\( 2^3 \\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Simplified Contribution:**\n\n\\[ (x^4)^a \\cdot (-3x)^b \\cdot 2^c = x^3 \\]\n\nGiven that \\( a + b + c = 3 \\) and need degree \\( x^3 \\),\n\nOnly valid combo seems to involve:\n- \\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 3 \\), \\( c = 0 \\)\n\nThis yields:\n\\[ (-3x)^3 = -27x^3 \\]\n\nSeems we can isolate functional component here without needing anything beside computational steps indicated.\n\n**Small Mental Check after This Exploration:**\n\nI realize from exploring potential strategies, the most thorough one (though unintuitive initially) came down to assessing contributions predominantly from interaction terms.\n\n**Aha Moment:**\n\nThe approach led to simplicity in focused term identification rather than blind expansion - that indeed the only \\( x^3 \\) carry-through is from direct computation.\n\nTherefore, **the coefficient of the \\( x^3 \\) term in the expanded polynomial** \\( (p(x))^3 \\) **is:** \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-27}\n\\]",

  "ground_truth": "By inspection, upon expanding the terms of the product $(x^4 - 3x + 2)(x^4 - 3x + 2)(x^4 - 3x + 2)$, the only term that has a degree of $3$ will be the term found by multiplying together the three linear terms. Thus, the desired coefficient is the coefficient is $(-3)(-3)(-3)=\\boxed{-27}$."
