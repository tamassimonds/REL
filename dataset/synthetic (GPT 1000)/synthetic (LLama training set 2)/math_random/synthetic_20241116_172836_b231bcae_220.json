    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem with a detailed and exploratory approach.\n\n### Understanding the Problem:\n\nFirst, let's break down what's given:\n- We have two numbers, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n- We're told that their sum is 399:\n  \\[\n  x + y = 399\n  \\]\n- Additionally, the fraction \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\) is \\(0.9\\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{x}{y} = 0.9\n  \\]\n\nWhat we're asked to find is \\(y - x\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts and Strategies:\n\nWhen I first glanced at this, I thought, \u201cThis looks like a system of equations problem, but with a twist involving a ratio.\u201d It's likely that manipulating these equations can lead us to find \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), after which we can then easily determine \\(y - x\\).\n\nGiven the fraction \\(\\frac{x}{y} = 0.9\\), it might be helpful to re-express this in terms of equations. Multiplying both sides by \\(y\\) gives us:\n\\[\nx = 0.9y\n\\]\n\nWith two equations now:\n1. \\(x + y = 399\\)\n2. \\(x = 0.9y\\)\n\nI can substitute the expression for \\(x\\) from the second equation into the first. This seems straightforward.\n\n### Solving the Equations:\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 0.9y\\) into the first equation:\n\\[\n0.9y + y = 399\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n1.9y = 399\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(y\\) by dividing both sides by 1.9:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{399}{1.9}\n\\]\n\nHmm, let's calculate that. I need to check my mental math here. Calculating 399 divided by 1.9 precisely, perhaps it's time to grab a calculator and do this division properly:\n\\[\n399 \\div 1.9 = 210\n\\]\n\nOkay, \\(y = 210\\). That seems right.\n\nNow, substitute back into \\(x = 0.9y\\):\n\\[\nx = 0.9 \\times 210 = 189\n\\]\n\n### Reflect and Double-Check:\n\nSo far, we've found:\n\\[ \nx = 189 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = 210 \n\\]\n\nQuick check, do these satisfy both original conditions?\n1. \\(x + y = 399\\) becomes \\(189 + 210 = 399\\). Yes, correct.\n2. \\(\\frac{x}{y} = 0.9\\) is \\(\\frac{189}{210} = 0.9\\). Yes, also correct.\n\nEverything seems consistent. Good, let's move forward now.\n\n### Find \\(y - x\\):\n\nFinally, calculate \\(y - x\\):\n\\[\ny - x = 210 - 189 = 21\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe desired value of \\(y - x\\) is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).\n\nThis process gave me a chance to both verify the calculations and reassure myself that the approach was correct every step of the way. Reflecting helps in building confidence in the solution. Always remember to double-check critical calculations to ensure accuracy.",

  "ground_truth": "We have the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 399 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{y} &= 0.9 \\\\\n\\end{align*} From the second equation, multiplying both sides by $y$ gives $x=.9y$. Next, substituting the second equation into the first to eliminate $x$ gives $.9y+y=399$, or $y=210$. Plugging in this value into the first equation in the original system of equations gives $x+210=399$ or $x=189$. Thus, $y-x=210-189=\\boxed{21}$."
