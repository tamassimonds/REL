    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. First, I'll try to understand clearly what it's asking for. The expression given is \\(a \\text{ Y } b = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\), and we need to evaluate \\(3 \\text{ Y } 2\\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- This expression \\(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\) looks familiar. It reminds me of something from algebra class, maybe a squared term or some factorization. Let's think about that.\n- The format \\(x^2 - 2xy + y^2\\) resembles the expansion of a perfect square. Could this be related to \\((x-y)^2\\)?\n\n**Exploration:**\n\n- Let's test the hypothesis that \\(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\) equals \\((a-b)^2\\). Rewrite it:\n  \\[\n  (a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2.\n  \\]\n  Ah, yes! That's exactly it. This was a trick to recognize patterns.\n\nSince the operation \\(\\text{Y}\\) between two numbers is making a squared difference, knowing that now, we simplify the given expression \\(3 \\text{ Y } 2\\) by recognizing it as \\((3-2)^2\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- \\(3 \\text{ Y } 2\\) is the same as \\((3-2)^2\\).\n- Calculating this, we have:\n  \\[\n  (3-2)^2 = 1^2 = 1.\n  \\]\n\n**Checking Work:**\n\n- Let's quickly verify by plugging into the original definition: \\(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nPlug in \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 2\\):\n\\[\n3^2 - 2 \\times 3 \\times 2 + 2^2 = 9 - 12 + 4.\n\\]\nCalculating step by step:\n- \\(9 - 12 = -3\\).\n- \\(-3 + 4 = 1\\).\n\nHmm, the calculation checks out with both methods. I expected it to, but it's nice to confirm by going back to the basics. Always feel reassuring to have multiple paths yielding the same result; means we didn't overlook anything.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe value of \\(3 \\text{ Y } 2\\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).\n\nI walked through recognizing the algebraic form, calculated it directly, then verified it step-by-step as per the definition\u2014doing everything a human might think through naturally to ensure accuracy.",

  "ground_truth": "We have $3 \\text{ Y } 2 = 3^2-2(2)(3)+2^2 = 9+4-12 = \\boxed{1}$.\n\nAlternatively, you could notice that $a^2-2ab+b^2=(a-b)^2$, so the answer is simply $(3-2)^2 = 1^2 = \\boxed{1}$."
