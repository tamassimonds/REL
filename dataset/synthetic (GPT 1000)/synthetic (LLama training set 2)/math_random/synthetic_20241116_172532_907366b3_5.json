    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. We're tasked with finding the greatest integer that can be the third side of a triangle, given that the other two sides are 4 cm and 9 cm. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, so when I see problems involving triangles and side lengths, the triangle inequality theorem immediately comes to mind. The theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. This is crucial for the formation of a valid triangle.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n1. Let's lay out the conditions provided by the triangle inequality theorem:\n   - The length of the third side, let's call it \\(x\\), along with the two known sides (4 cm and 9 cm), should satisfy three conditions:\n     1. \\(4 + 9 > x\\)\n     2. \\(4 + x > 9\\)\n     3. \\(9 + x > 4\\)\n\n**Evaluating Each Condition:**\n\n2. Analyzing \\(4 + 9 > x\\):\n   - This simplifies to \\(13 > x\\), or equivalently \\(x < 13\\).\n\n3. Moving to \\(4 + x > 9\\):\n   - This simplifies to \\(x > 5\\).\n\n4. Finally, examining \\(9 + x > 4\\):\n   - This simplifies to \\(x > -5\\). However, this condition doesn't actually limit \\(x\\) significantly since any positive number will fulfill this requirement.\n\n**Combining the Conditions:**\n5. Based on these, \\(x\\) must satisfy both \\(x < 13\\) and \\(x > 5\\). So the range for \\(x\\) is \\(5 < x < 13\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n6. We need the greatest integer value for \\(x\\) within this range. The largest integer less than 13 is 12.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n7. Let\u2019s quickly verify the integer value:\n   - With \\(x = 12\\):\n     - \\(4 + 9 = 13 > 12\\) - holds true.\n     - \\(4 + 12 = 16 > 9\\) - holds true.\n     - \\(9 + 12 = 21 > 4\\) - holds true.\n   - All conditions of the triangle inequality are satisfied with \\(x = 12\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n8. After stepping through the conditions and validating them, the greatest integer number of centimeters that could be the third side of the triangle is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).\n\nThis makes sense as all conditions are met and it adheres to the basic property that is essential for these side lengths to indeed form a triangle. By breaking down the problem and working systematically, we've confirmed that our approach and solution are sound.",
