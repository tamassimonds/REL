  "problem": "My school's Physics Club has 22 members.  It needs to select 3 officers: chairman, vice-chairman, and sergeant-at-arms.  Each person can hold at most one office.  Two of the members, Penelope and Quentin, will only be officers if the other one is also an officer.  (In other words, either both Penelope and Quentin are officers, or neither are.)  In how many ways can the club choose its officers?",

    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. \n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first look at this problem, it seems like a classic combination and permutation problem with an added condition regarding Penelope and Quentin. Immediately, my brain wants to separate the problem into two parts: choosing officers assuming Penelope and Quentin are both involved, and choosing officers when neither of them is involved. This bifurcation due to the condition seems necessary. But how should I proceed with counting?\n\n**Initial Exploration:**\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the problem context:**\n   - We have 22 club members.\n   - We need to fill three distinct roles: chairman, vice-chairman, and sergeant-at-arms.\n   - Each role is unique, so we're dealing with permutations, not combinations.\n   - The condition: Either Penelope and Quentin both are in the officer cadre, or neither is.\n\n2. **Two possible scenarios based on the condition:**\n   - **Scenario 1:** Both Penelope and Quentin are officers.\n   - **Scenario 2:** Neither Penelope nor Quentin are officers.\n\n**Let's address scenario by scenario:**\n\n**Scenario 1: Both Penelope and Quentin are Officers**\n- If both are officers, we need to place them in three roles, and we need to choose the third officer from the remaining 20 members (since 2 of the 22 are already chosen).\n- First, pick any role for Penelope, and then pick any role for Quentin among the remaining two roles. Then, choose one of the remaining 20 members to fill the last role.\n  - Total ways: \\(3 \\times 2 \\times 20 = 120\\)\n\n**Scenario 2: Neither Penelope nor Quentin are Officers**\n- Now, we choose all three officers from the remaining 20 club members.\n- We can select and arrange the officers in this case without concern for the specific P/Q condition which becomes irrelevant.\n  - Total ways: \\(20 \\times 19 \\times 18 = 6840\\)\n\n**Calculating Total Possibilities:**\n\n1. **Scenario 1 total:** 120\n2. **Scenario 2 total:** 6840\n\nAdding the two scenarios gives us the total number of ways to select the officers while adhering to the condition:\n\\[ 120 + 6840 = 6960 \\]\n\n**Reflection and Verification:**\n\nThat number seems reasonable given the constraints. Let me reflect on the logic used:\n- I properly divided the scenarios based on the condition.\n- In each scenario, the counting involves permutations of choices with unique roles which are accounted for correctly.\n- The total permutations without P and Q are logically calculated via standard permutations.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy cross-verifying with step-based logic and permutation calculations, the approach seems sound.\n\nThus, the Physics Club can choose their officers in **6960 different ways** while respecting the condition outlined.",

  "ground_truth": "If both Penelope and Quentin are not officers, then there are 20 choices for chairman, 19 choices for vice-chairman, and 18 choices for sergeant-at-arms. There are $20\\times 19\\times 18=6840$ ways in this case.\n\nIf both are officers, Penelope can take one of the 3 positions, Quentin can take one of the 2 remaining positions, and one of the 20 remaining members can take the third position. There are $3\\times 2\\times 20=120$ ways in this case.\n\nThe answer is $6840+120=\\boxed{6960}.$"
