    "working_out": "Alright, let's start by understanding and brainstorming the problem. We have a square \\(ABCD\\) and a point \\(E\\) such that \\(AE\\) is perpendicular to \\(ED\\). The lengths given are \\(AE = 8\\) units and \\(DE = 6\\) units. Our task is to find the area of pentagon \\(AEDCB\\).\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- The fact that \\(AE\\) and \\(DE\\) are perpendicular suggests that \\(A\\), \\(E\\), and \\(D\\) form a right triangle.\n- Since \\(ABCD\\) is a square, its side length will be the same, and my first thought is we might need to find that.\n- The pentagon \\(AEDCB\\) takes up space within the square, so maybe we need to discern whether \\(E\\) is inside the square or outside.\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Understand the right triangle**: Recognizing that a right triangle \\(AED\\) is formed, we can potentially use the Pythagorean Theorem to find something useful.\n2. **Determine possible positions of \\(E\\)**: Since \\(AE\\) is vertical, could \\(E\\) lie within the boundary of the square making it need to be inside \\(ABCD\\)? Also, could \\(DE\\) possibly lie diagonally across or partly outside the square?\n3. **Calculate the side of the square**: One quick way to progress is figuring out if we can calculate the side of the square, provided \\(E\\) actually lies inside this square.\n\n### Calculation and Verification:\n\n1. **Use Pythagorean Theorem**: In triangle \\(AED\\), \\(AE^2 + DE^2 = AD^2\\).\n   \\[\n   AE^2 + DE^2 = 8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   AD = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n   \\]\n   This suggests one side of the square is 10 units \u2014 that checks out since \\(AD\\) must equal \\(AB\\), \\(BC\\), and \\(CD\\).\n\n2. **Check Position of \\(E\\)**: Given that \\(AE\\) and \\(DE\\) are perpendicular, \\(E\\) can logically be inside the square as AE and ED being perpendicular enforces that the direction they both take keeps point E inside the square.\n   \n3. **Calculate Square\u2019s Area**: Since \\(ABCD\\) is a square of side 10,\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of square} = 10 \\times 10 = 100 \\text{ square units}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Triangle\u2019s Area**: Now compute the area of \\( \\triangle AED \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of } \\triangle AED = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 6 = 24 \\text{ square units}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Pentagon\u2019s Area**: Subtract the area of \\(\\triangle AED\\) from the total area of the square to find the area of pentagon \\(AEDCB\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of pentagon } AEDCB = 100 - 24 = 76 \\text{ square units}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe area of pentagon \\(AEDCB\\) is \\(76\\) square units. Throughout, I ensured all validity through interaction of elements provided, like borders used, perpendicularity, and subtraction method verifying the main structure. \n\n**Final Check**: Given results seem consistent with general understanding of geometry. When examining all the given configurations and values, it all holds together correctly logically and numerically!",

  "ground_truth": "Noticing that $ADE$ is a 3-4-5 right triangle scaled by a factor of 2, we have $AD=2 \\cdot 5=10$. Thus, the area of square $ABCD$ is $10 \\cdot 10=100$. The area of triangle $ADE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 6 \\cdot 8=3 \\cdot 8=24$. Finally, we calculate the area of pentagon $ABCDE$ to be the difference of the two: $100-24=\\boxed{76} \\text{ sq units}$."
