    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this probability problem and think through it step by step.\n\n### Initial Thoughts\nFirst of all, looking at the problem, it reminds me a bit of basic probability exercises I've done before. The main task seems to be figuring out the probability of drawing a marble that is either red or blue. This implies some sort of addition of probabilities because we're looking at two favorable outcomes (either red or blue).\n\n- **Marbles in the bag**: I see we have a total of 3 red, 2 blue, and 5 yellow marbles. First instinct is to list them out to keep track: 3 red, 2 blue, 5 yellow.\n- **Total marbles**: Adding these up sounds like a good starting point to find the total possibilities when picking a marble. So, it's 3 + 2 + 5 = 10 marbles in total.\n\n### Exploring Methods\nLet's think about the best way to approach this. A couple of strategies come to mind:\n\n1. **Calculating individual probabilities and adding**: Calculate the probability of drawing a red marble, and the probability of drawing a blue marble, then add them because these events are mutually exclusive (drawing a red marble doesn't impact drawing a blue one).\n\n2. **Revisiting complementary probability**: It could be possible to calculate the probability of drawing a non-favorable outcome (yellow) and subtracting from 1, but that seems unnecessarily complicated here.\n\nOkay, I think starting with the first strategy makes sense. Let's go step by step.\n\n### Step-by-step Approach\n\n**Step 1: Probability of Drawing a Red Marble**\n- We have 3 red marbles. The total number of marbles is 10. \n- The probability of drawing a red marble is thus: \n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Red}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of Red Marbles}}{\\text{Total Marbles}} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Probability of Drawing a Blue Marble**\n- Similarly, there are 2 blue marbles in the bag.\n- The probability of drawing a blue marble is: \n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Blue}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of Blue Marbles}}{\\text{Total Marbles}} = \\frac{2}{10} = 0.2\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Total Probability of Drawing a Red or Blue Marble**\n- Since drawing a red and drawing a blue marble are mutually exclusive events, we simply add these probabilities:\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Red or Blue}) = P(\\text{Red}) + P(\\text{Blue}) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5\n  \\]\n\n### Checks and Reflection\n- **Quick Check**: Does 0.5 make sense for the probability? Yes, it seems reasonable. Half of the marbles in the bag are either red or blue (3 red + 2 blue = 5 out of 10 total marbles).\n- **Does the approach make sense?**: Absolutely, both steps involved basic probability calculations, and there are no overlaps or other complicating factors like dependencies.\n\nReflecting on this process, the solution seems clean and logical, and the result aligns with what one would intuitively expect from inspecting the numbers. There doesn't seem to be a need for another method, as this efficiently gave us the probability required.\n\nFinal answer: The probability of drawing a marble that is either red or blue is **0.5**.",
