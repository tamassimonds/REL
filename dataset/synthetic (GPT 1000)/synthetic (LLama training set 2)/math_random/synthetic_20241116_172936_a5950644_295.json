    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n### Initial Thoughts\nWhen I first read this problem, it strikes me as a functional equation problem. These usually require us to use the given functional equation to find specific values or understand the form of the function.\n\nThe functional equation given is:\n\\[ f(xy) = \\frac{f(x)}{y} \\]\n\nWe are tasked to find \\( f(40) \\), knowing that \\( f(30) = 20 \\).\n\n### Brainstorming and Strategy\nThis looks similar to problems where we try to express one variable in terms of others using the functional equation. I instinctively think about the possibility of the function being related to multiplication or division, considering the division by \\( y \\).\n\nA possible strategy:\n1. **Plug-in Simple Values**: Test the function with \\( x \\) or \\( y \\) set to 1 to see if it simplifies.\n2. **Look for Patterns**: Determine if specific substitutions reveal a pattern or suggest a functional form.\n3. **Substitute Known Values**: Use the known value, \\( f(30) = 20 \\), to gain insights.\n\nLet's try these strategies.\n\n### Exploring Simple Values\n#### Step 1: Substitute \\( y = 1 \\).\nSubstituting \\( y = 1 \\) into the functional equation:\n\\[ f(x \\cdot 1) = \\frac{f(x)}{1} \\]\n\\[ f(x) = f(x) \\]\n\nHmm. This simplifies to a trivial identity, which doesn't provide new information. Let's try another approach.\n\n#### Step 2: Substitute \\( x = 1 \\).\nSubstituting \\( x = 1 \\):\n\\[ f(y) = \\frac{f(1)}{y} \\]\n- This suggests \\( f(y) = \\frac{A}{y} \\) where \\( A = f(1) \\).\n\n### Verification and Pattern Recognition\nLet's verify if this potential solution \\( f(x) = \\frac{A}{x} \\) satisfies the original equation:\n- Left side: \\( f(xy) = \\frac{A}{xy} \\)\n- Right side: \\( \\frac{f(x)}{y} = \\frac{A/x}{y} = \\frac{A}{xy} \\)\n\nThey match! This suggests \\( f(x) = \\frac{A}{x} \\) is indeed a valid form.\n\n### Using Known Values\nWe know \\( f(30) = 20 \\). This can help us find \\( A \\).\n#### Solve for \\( A \\):\n\\[ f(30) = \\frac{A}{30} = 20 \\]\n\\[ A = 20 \\times 30 = 600 \\]\n\n### Finding \\( f(40) \\)\nWith \\( A = 600 \\), we substitute into the form:\n\\[ f(40) = \\frac{600}{40} \\]\n\nNow let's calculate:\n\\[ f(40) = \\frac{600}{40} = 15 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nI'm confident about the approach and calculations, so:\n\\[ f(40) = 15 \\]\n\nReflecting back, substituting simpler values and using the known condition led us efficiently to the final solution. It captured the essence of the functional equation, yielding a consistent function form and checking out according to the given conditions.",

  "ground_truth": "Setting $x = 30$ and $y = \\frac{4}{3},$ we get\n\\[f(40) = \\frac{f(30)}{4/3} = \\frac{20}{4/3} = \\boxed{15}.\\]"
