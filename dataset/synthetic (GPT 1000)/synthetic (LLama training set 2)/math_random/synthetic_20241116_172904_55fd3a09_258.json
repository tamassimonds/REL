    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem. First, let me take a moment to really understand what's being asked here. We are given two opposite vertices of a rectangle: (3,17) and (9,-4), and the task is to find the sum of the y-coordinates of the other two vertices.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\n- This seems like a geometry problem dealing with rectangles.\n- Opposite vertices suggest we can use properties of rectangles to find missing points.\n- The rectangle can be rotated or aligned with axes, and we need to be mindful of this.\n\nI've seen similar problems where we use midpoints or vector properties to work it out. But hmm, do I start by sketching it? I feel that might help me visualize things better. Let me jot some ideas down. \n\n### Brainstorming Strategies:\n1. **Midpoint Approach**: Since the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, calculate the midpoint of the given vertices first. Then use this midpoint to find expressions or constraints for the other two vertices.\n   \n2. **Slope and Distance**: Consider using slopes since right angles might help me establish perpendicularity. Or calculate distance properties to ensure the opposite sides are equal.\n   \n3. **Translation and Rotation**: Think of translating the rectangle to align with the axes or determine any rotation. But maybe that complicates it \u2013 let's see.\n\n### Strategy 1: Midpoint Approach\nLet's start with calculating the midpoint. This should be straightforward.\n\n- Midpoint \\((x_m, y_m)\\) of \\((3, 17)\\) and \\((9, -4)\\):\n  \\[\n  x_m = \\frac{3 + 9}{2} = 6, \\quad y_m = \\frac{17 - 4}{2} = 6.5\n  \\]\nHmm, that midpoint seems reasonable.\n\n### Using Midpoint to Check:\n- If \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the unknown vertices of the other diagonal, they must satisfy:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 6, \\quad \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = 6.5\n  \\]\n  Therefore,\n  \\[\n  x_1 + x_2 = 12, \\quad y_1 + y_2 = 13\n  \\]\n  Ah, so the sum of the y-coordinates is 13!\n\n### Is This Approach Correct?\n- **Quick Check**: This seems right because the midpoint is a consistent property of rectangles.\n- **Reflection**: If such a midpoint exists, it should apply correctly. No other steps needed for finding the sum of y-coordinates.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe solution feels coherent and right. The key insight was realizing that using the rectangle's property of bisecting diagonals gives the required sum of \\(y\\)-coordinates directly.\n\n**Sum of the other y-coordinates: 13**. \n\nLooking back, the focus on the midpoint made for a good straightforward approach\u2014definitely textbook-like rectangle properties at work here!",

  "ground_truth": "The midpoints of the diagonals of a rectangle coincide, so the midpoint of the line segment joining $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ is also the midpoint of the line segment joining the other two vertices of the rectangle. The $y$-coordinate of a midpoint equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the two endpoints. Therefore, the average of the $y$-coordinates of $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices.  Since the sum is twice the average, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices is the same as that of the given vertices: $17+(-4)=\\boxed{13}$."
