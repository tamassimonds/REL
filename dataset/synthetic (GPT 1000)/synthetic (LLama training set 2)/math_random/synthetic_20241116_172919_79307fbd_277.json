    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. Initially, the problem statement might feel a bit daunting, but let's break it down step by step. \n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\nJuan is rolling an octahedral die which has sides numbered from 1 to 8. Amal is rolling a standard six-sided die, numbered from 1 to 6. We need to find the probability that the product of their rolls is a multiple of 3. \n\nFirst thoughts:\n- A product is a multiple of 3 if at least one of the factors (either the number rolled by Juan or Amal) is a multiple of 3. \n- So, let's figure out how often each die shows a multiple of 3.\n\n**Step 1: Consider the octahedral die (1 to 8).**\n- Multiples of 3 within 1 to 8 are 3 and 6. \n- So, out of 8 possible outcomes, there are 2 outcomes where the result on the octahedral die is a multiple of 3.\n- This gives a probability of Juan rolling a multiple of 3 as 2/8 or 1/4.\n\nNow, a quick check here: Yes, it seems right since 3 and 6 are indeed the only multiples of 3 within the range of 1 to 8.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the six-sided die (1 to 6).**\n- Multiples of 3 within 1 to 6 are 3 and 6.\n- So, there are 2 outcomes out of 6 where Amal rolls a multiple of 3.\n- This gives a probability of Amal rolling a multiple of 3 as 2/6 or 1/3.\n\nAnother quick check: I initially thought through it, and it seems correct since 3 and 6 are the only valid multiples of 3 within 1 to 6.\n\n**Step 3: Handling cases where neither roll is a multiple of 3.**\n- The product isn't a multiple of 3 if neither number is a multiple of 3.\n- The probability of Juan not rolling a multiple of 3 is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n- The probability of Amal not rolling a multiple of 3 is 1 - 1/3 = 2/3.\n\nQuick reflection: This approach seems sound, as I'm asking myself, \"How do we ensure the product isn't a multiple of 3?\"\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the probability neither are multiples of 3.**\n- The probability that neither roll is a multiple of 3 (and thus their product is not a multiple of 3) is the product of the probabilities of neither being multiples.\n- Probability = (3/4) * (2/3) = 1/2.\n\n**Aha moment:** It hit me that to find the probability of the product being a multiple of 3, we need to subtract the above from 1.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n- So, the probability that the product is a multiple of 3 is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- I should quickly validate this: While each calculation seems probable and logical, stepping back to see the entire workflow through the lens of understanding gets me to see it's consistent.\n- Looking back, all steps are aligning perfectly; logic seems sound throughout.\n\nThus, the probability that the product is a multiple of 3 is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "The product will be a multiple of 3 if and only if at least one of the two rolls is a 3 or a 6. The probability that Juan rolls  3 or 6 is $2/8 = 1/4$. The probability that Juan does not roll 3 or 6, but Amal does is $(3/4) (1/3) = 1/4$. Thus, the probability that the product of the rolls is a multiple of 3 is $$\n\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n$$"
