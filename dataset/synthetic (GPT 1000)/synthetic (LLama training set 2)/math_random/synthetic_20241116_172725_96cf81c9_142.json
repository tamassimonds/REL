    "working_out": "First Thoughts:\n- As I read the problem, the task involves transformations involving circle \\(T\\)'s center at coordinates \\((-2, 6)\\).\n- These transformations are reflection and translation, which are common geometric transformations.\n- I've encountered similar problems before, where you apply transformations sequentially. So, this isn't completely unfamiliar terrain.\n\nExploring Strategies:\n1. **Reflection across the \\(y\\)-axis**:\n    - Reflecting across the \\(y\\)-axis changes the \\(x\\)-coordinate to its opposite, while the \\(y\\)-coordinate remains the same.\n    - So, reflecting \\((-2, 6)\\) across the \\(y\\)-axis would result in the point \\((2, 6)\\).\n\n2. **Translation 8 units down**:\n    - Translating a point vertically affects the \\(y\\)-coordinate.\n    - Moving 8 units down means decreasing the \\(y\\)-coordinate by 8.\n    - Applying this to \\((2, 6)\\), the new \\(y\\)-coordinate is \\(6 - 8 = -2\\).\n    - Therefore, the resulting coordinates would be \\((2, -2)\\).\n\nCheck the Work:\n- Let me verify each step, imagining the transformations to ensure they're applied correctly.\n    - Reflecting \\((-2, 6)\\) to \\((2, 6)\\) seems right, considering how reflections across the \\(y\\)-axis work.\n    - Translating \\((2, 6)\\) downwards to \\((2, -2)\\) by moving the \\(y\\)-coordinate seems accurate.\n- Both transformations seem to follow the rules of geometry correctly.\n\nA Deeper Reflection:\n- Reflecting back, the problem seemed straightforward enough. I didn't encounter any major pitfalls.\n- Maybe I should think through other potential mistakes: Is it possible to misinterpret \"8 units down\"? Not likely, since we're confidently adjusting the \\(y\\)-value.\n- All calculations appear consistent with typical geometric transformation principles.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\n- The final coordinates for the image of the center of circle \\(T\\) after these transformations are indeed \\((2, -2)\\).\n- I've double-checked at each stage, and it all aligns properly with what I know about reflections and translations.",

  "ground_truth": "Since the image is reflected across the $y$-axis first, we will just change the sign of the $x$-coordinate, which will give us $(2, 6)$. Next the image is shifted down 8 units so we will subtract 8 from the $y$-coordinate, giving our image a final center of $\\boxed{(2, -2)}$."
