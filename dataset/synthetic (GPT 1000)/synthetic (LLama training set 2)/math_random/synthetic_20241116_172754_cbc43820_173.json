    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: we want to find \\(\\tan\\left(x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\) given that \\(\\tan x = 2\\).\n\nFirst thoughts:  \nThis problem is related to trigonometric identities. The given \\(\\tan x = 2\\) is pretty straightforward, so it seems logical to use some identity related to tangent, particularly the angle addition formula for tangent since \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) is involved. Here's what I'm thinking:\n\n1. **Reflection**: We need to find \\(\\tan(x + \\frac{\\pi}{4})\\). The tangent addition formula is:  \n   \\[\n   \\tan(a + b) = \\frac{\\tan a + \\tan b}{1 - \\tan a \\tan b}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Applying the formula**:  \n   For \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\), let's substitute these values:  \n   \\[\n   \\tan(x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{\\tan x + \\tan \\frac{\\pi}{4}}{1 - \\tan x \\tan \\frac{\\pi}{4}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying step-by-step**:  \n   From trigonometric values, we know \\(\\tan \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 1\\).  \n   \n   Substitute the known values:  \n   \\[\n   \\tan(x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{2 + 1}{1 - 2 \\cdot 1}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Reflecting on the equation**:  \n   Double-check before simplifying further: this looks correct as we replaced \\(\\tan x\\) with 2 and \\(\\tan \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) with 1. Let's simplify the arithmetic.\n\n5. **Simplifying number-wise**:  \n   \\[\n   \\tan(x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{3}{1 - 2} = \\frac{3}{-1}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculating a result**:  \n   After simplifying,  \n   \\[\n   \\tan(x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}) = -3\n   \\]\n\n7. **Final reflection**:  \n   This seems consistent as \\(\\tan(x + \\frac{\\pi}{4})\\) should yield a clean numerical result given the setup. Trigonometric identity usage checks out, and arithmetic didn\u2019t have any unexpected complexity. This feels like the correct and precise approach.\n\nThus, the solution to the problem is \\(\\tan(x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}) = -3\\).",
