    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. We've got a quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 13x + 4 = 0\\) and need to find the sum of the squares of its solutions. My first thought is, okay, we have a quadratic, which reminds me of the quadratic formula for finding solutions. But wait, there's also Vi\u00e8te's formulas for directly dealing with equations like this. Let's brainstorm a bit to choose the right strategy.\n\n### First Thoughts\n\n1. **Quadratic Formula**: I could find the solutions using the quadratic formula: \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -13\\), and \\(c = 4\\), I'd get the roots \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Then, I'd square each root and add them. But that sounds a bit tedious without a calculator for square roots. Is there an easier method?\n\n2. **Vi\u00e8te's Formulas**: These formulas tell us that for a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\):\n   - The sum of the roots, \\(x_1 + x_2\\), is \\(-b/a\\).\n   - The product of the roots, \\(x_1 \\times x_2\\), is \\(c/a\\).\n\n   With Vi\u00e8te's formulas, I could directly find the roots' sum and product without solving for the actual roots. There's a formula for the sum of squares of the roots: \\(x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2\\). This seems much more straightforward.\n\n### Exploring Vi\u00e8te's Approach\n\nLet's apply Vi\u00e8te's formulas:\n- \\((x_1 + x_2) = 13\\) since \\(-b/a = -(-13)/1 = 13\\).\n- \\((x_1 \\times x_2) = 4\\) since \\(c/a = 4/1 = 4\\).\n\nNow, use these to find the sum of the squares of the roots:\n\\[\nx_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the values we found:\n\\[\nx_1^2 + x_2^2 = 13^2 - 2 \\times 4 = 169 - 8 = 161\n\\]\n\nOh, I see\u2014calculating directly this way is more efficient. The sum of the squares is 161.\n\n### Quick Double-check\n\nLet me make a quick check here:\n- From Vi\u00e8te, we know \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are solutions to the quadratic, so their properties hold.\n- The sum \\((x_1 + x_2)^2 = 169\\), another mental note to verify the math, which indeed gives 161 when subtracting twice their product.\n\nGreat, I am confident now that the sum of the squares of the solutions is 161.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThrough exploration, checking different strategies, and applying Vi\u00e8te's formulas, we've arrived at the result: \\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 161\\] for the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 13x + 4 = 0\\).",

  "ground_truth": "Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this polynomial. Therefore, $r_1+r_2=13$ and $r_1r_2=4$. Notice that $r_1^2+2r_1r_2+r_2^2=169$. This means that the sum of the squares of the roots can be obtained by subtracting the term containing the product of $r_1$ and $r_2$, so $r_1^2+r_2^2=169-2(4)=\\boxed{161}$."
