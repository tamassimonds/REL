    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem together. The question is asking us to find the number of integers \\( n \\) such that \\( 10 < n^2 < 99 \\). \n\n### Brainstorming\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. When I see a problem like this, I think about how to reverse-engineer the inequality to focus on \\( n \\) instead of \\( n^2 \\). \n\n**Idea 1:** I could take square roots of all parts to get a sense for what values of \\( n \\) might work. Generally, doing so with inequalities involving squares makes logical sense.\n\n**Idea 2:** Another thought is to consider a range of potential values for \\( n \\) and manually check each one (but that seems a bit tedious, and an inefficient way to start).\n\n### Initial Calculation Attempts\n\nLet's start by taking square roots, since that aligns with my first idea. This is logical because if \\( n^2 \\) needs to be between 10 and 99, then \\( n \\) needs to be between the square roots of these bounds:\n\n1. **Calculate square roots of bounds:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.162\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{99} \\approx 9.95\n   \\]\n\n   So, \\( n \\) should be greater than \\( \\sqrt{10} \\) and less than \\( \\sqrt{99} \\).\n\n2. **Translate to integer values:**\n\n   Since \\( n \\) is an integer, we can round these values to narrow our range. The smallest integer greater than 3.162 is 4, and the largest integer less than 9.95 is 9.\n\n   Therefore, \\( n \\) must range from 4 to 9 (inclusive).\n\n### Verifying Integer Values\n\n3. **Check each integer within the range:**\n\n   Now, make sure these integer values actually satisfy \\( 10 < n^2 < 99 \\):\n\n   - \\( n = 4: \\quad n^2 = 16 \\) (satisfies \\( 10 < 16 < 99 \\))\n   - \\( n = 5: \\quad n^2 = 25 \\) (satisfies \\( 10 < 25 < 99 \\))\n   - \\( n = 6: \\quad n^2 = 36 \\) (satisfies \\( 10 < 36 < 99 \\))\n   - \\( n = 7: \\quad n^2 = 49 \\) (satisfies \\( 10 < 49 < 99 \\))\n   - \\( n = 8: \\quad n^2 = 64 \\) (satisfies \\( 10 < 64 < 99 \\))\n   - \\( n = 9: \\quad n^2 = 81 \\) (satisfies \\( 10 < 81 < 99 \\))\n\n4. **Count the number of integers:**\n\n   All tested integers from 4 to 9 are valid, giving us a total of 6 integers.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nReflecting on our approach, taking the square roots gave a direct path to identifying the range of integers. The calculations were confirmed manually, ensuring they met the initial conditions. This strategy seems robust and clear.\n\n**Conclusion:** There are 6 integers \\( n \\) that satisfy \\( 10 < n^2 < 99 \\). These integers are \\( n = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\).\n\nAhh, I see where I went wrong in my previous solution. Let's revisit this problem and ensure we account for all possibilities.\n\n### Re-evaluation\n\nThe task is to determine the number of integers \\( n \\) such that:\n\n\\[10 < n^2 < 99.\\]\n\nIn my previous analysis, I considered only the positive integers, but I neglected to consider the negative integers that would also satisfy the inequality. Let's address this oversight.\n\n### Strategy Exploration\n\n1. **Re-examining the Scope**:\n   - We started by calculating the approximate square roots of the bounds, getting \\(\\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.162\\) and \\(\\sqrt{99} \\approx 9.95\\). This means the appropriate \\( n \\) values for positives fall between 4 and 9, inclusive.\n   - However, since squaring a negative integer results in the same positive \\( n^2 \\) value as its positive counterpart, we must extend our exploration to include negative integers.\n\n2. **Considering Negative Integers**:\n   - The negative integers corresponding to \\( n = -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9 \\) also result in valid \\( n^2 \\) values within the given range. \n\n3. **Valid Integer Values**:\n   - Let's list both negative and positive integers that satisfy the condition:\n     - Negative integers: \\(-9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4\\)\n     - Positive integers: \\(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\)\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Check each integer \\( n \\) to ensure it satisfies \\( 10 < n^2 < 99 \\):\n     - For negatives: \n       - \\( n = -4: n^2 = 16 \\)\n       - \\( n = -5: n^2 = 25 \\)\n       - \\( n = -6: n^2 = 36 \\)\n       - \\( n = -7: n^2 = 49 \\)\n       - \\( n = -8: n^2 = 64 \\)\n       - \\( n = -9: n^2 = 81 \\)\n     - For positives: \n       - \\( n = 4: n^2 = 16 \\)\n       - \\( n = 5: n^2 = 25 \\)\n       - \\( n = 6: n^2 = 36 \\)\n       - \\( n = 7: n^2 = 49 \\)\n       - \\( n = 8: n^2 = 64 \\)\n       - \\( n = 9: n^2 = 81 \\)\n\n5. **Reflect and Validate**:\n   - Incorporating both positive and negative integers ensures we account for all possibilities. Our list now correctly includes \\(-9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\), totaling 12 valid integers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReflecting on this corrected approach, it's clear we overlooked the negative integers initially. It's important to remember that squaring a negative number yields the same result as squaring its positive counterpart. Therefore, there are \\(\\boxed{12}\\) integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the inequality \\( 10 < n^2 < 99 \\).",
