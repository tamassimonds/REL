    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. The equation is \\( x^2 + 2x = i \\), and we need to find the product of the real parts of its complex solutions.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\nFirst, I want to ensure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. We're dealing with a quadratic equation where the right-hand side is the imaginary unit \\( i \\). Typically, quadratic equations I\u2019ve solved before have real coefficients, but here it seems we're directly in the realm of complex numbers.\n\n### Potential Approaches\n- **Completing the Square:** This approach can be used to transform the quadratic equation into a more manageable form. \n- **Quadratic Formula:** A direct method that provides solutions using complex arithmetic.\n- **Comparing Real & Imaginary Parts:** Might help after obtaining the solution.\n\nI\u2019ll start with the quadratic formula since it applies to all quadratics and gives a complete solution quickly.\n\n### Quadratic Formula\nThe quadratic formula is \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\).\n\nFor our equation \\( x^2 + 2x - i = 0 \\), the coefficients are:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = 2 \\)\n- \\( c = -i \\)\n\nLet's plug these into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-i)}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = 4 + 4i = 4(1+i)\n\\]\n\nNow the square root of this is a bit tricky, as it involves complex numbers. I need to simplify \\( \\sqrt{4(1+i)} \\).\n\n### Simplifying the Square Root\nTo find \\( \\sqrt{4(1+i)} \\), observe that:\n\nSince it's 4 times something, take 2 out as:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{4(1+i)} = 2\\sqrt{1+i}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( z = a + bi \\), the magnitude formula is: \n\n\\[\n|z|^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\\]\n\nSo we have \\( 1+i \\) with magnitude:\n\n\\[\n|1 + i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nThe square root of 1+i in polar form \\( re^{i\\theta} \\) is therefore \\( e^{i\\theta/2} \\) with:\n\nConverting \\( 1+i \\) to polar form gives:\n\nMagnitude \\( r = \\sqrt{2} \\), and argument \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1+i} = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{2}}e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{8}}\n\\]\n\nHence:\n\n\\[\n2\\sqrt{1+i} = 2\\sqrt{\\sqrt{2}}e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{8}}\n\\]\n\n### Apply to Formula\nSubstitute back into the quadratic equation to get:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{\\sqrt{2}} e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{8}}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n\\[\nx = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{\\sqrt{2}} e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{8}}\n\\]\n\n### Simplified Complex Solutions\nNow, \\( x_1 = -1 + \\sqrt{\\sqrt{2}} e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{8}} \\) and \\( x_2 = -1 - \\sqrt{\\sqrt{2}} e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{8}} \\).\n\n### Extracting Real Parts\nConsider the real part:\n\nFor both solutions in terms of real parts: \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) have a real component part of \\(-1 + \\) some offset from the complex term I calculated.\n\n### Product of Real Parts\nThe product of their real parts is:\n\n\\[\n(-1) \\times (-1) = 1\n\\]\n\n### Verification\nEach approach \u2013 using algebra, solving complex numbers, and reasoning mathematically \u2013 aligns with my result. The product seems logical considering typical behaviors of quadratic roots and symmetry. \n\nThus, the product of the real parts of the solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculations. Let's go through this again and figure out the correct solution.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Problem\nGiven the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + 2x = i\\), we know from my previous attempt that using the quadratic formula led to some complications, especially with handling square roots of complex numbers. To find the product of the real parts correctly, let's try a different approach\u2014completing the square.\n\n### Completing the Square\nTo complete the square, let's rewrite \\(x^2 + 2x = i\\) by adding \\(1\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 2x + 1 = i + 1 \\implies (x+1)^2 = 1+i\n\\]\n\nNow, express \\(1+i\\) in polar form. The modulus is:\n\n\\[\n|1+i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nAnd the argument \\(\\theta\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{1}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(1+i = \\sqrt{2} e^{i\\pi/4}\\). The square root is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1+i} = \\sqrt[4]{2} e^{i\\pi/8}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n\\[\nx+1 = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{2} e^{i\\pi/8}\n\\]\n\n### Finding the Real Parts\nThe real parts of the solutions \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are:\n\n\\[\nx_1 = -1 + \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)\\sqrt[4]{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx_2 = -1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)\\sqrt[4]{2}\n\\]\n\n### Calculating the Product of Real Parts\nThe product of the real parts is:\n\n\\[\n(-1 + \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)\\sqrt[4]{2})(-1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)\\sqrt[4]{2})\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)\\sqrt[4]{2}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nUsing the identity for cosine double angle, \\(\\cos(2\\theta) = 2\\cos^2(\\theta) - 1\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right) = \\frac{1 + \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)}{2} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{2} = \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the product is:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{4}\\sqrt{2} = 1 - \\frac{2\\sqrt{2} + 2}{4} = \\frac{4 - 2\\sqrt{2} - 2}{4} = \\frac{2 - 2\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the corrected product of the real parts of the solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{2}}{2}}\n\\]\n\nThis process better aligns with the mathematical properties and the correct handling of complex roots, confirming that my understanding and manipulation of the polar forms and real components yield the correct answer.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous calculations.
