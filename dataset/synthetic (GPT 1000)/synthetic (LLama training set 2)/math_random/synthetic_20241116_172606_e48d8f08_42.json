    "working_out": "Okay, let's dive into this problem. We're tasked with finding the minimum value of \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}\\) given that \\(x + y = 10\\). \n\nFirst thoughts: This problem reminds me of optimization problems, and functions like \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{y}\\) suggest a potential use of AM-GM inequality or Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Also, the equation \\(x + y = 10\\) makes me think about substitution possibilities. We want to minimize something, so maybe calculus could be involved too with derivatives. But first, let's explore simpler methods.\n\n**Step 1: Substitution Strategy**\n\nGiven \\(x + y = 10\\), let's express one variable in terms of the other: \\(y = 10 - x\\). Substituting into \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{10-x}.\n\\]\n\nNow, we have a function \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{10-x}\\). Finding the minimum of this function sounds like a calculus job. But before jumping into that, let's see if there's a simpler algebraic trick.\n\n**Step 2: Observe Symmetry**\n\nOh! This expression is symmetric in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). This reminds me of when minimum or maximum values were achieved with symmetric variables in inequalities. Often, particularly with symmetric sums or products, the extremum occurs when the variables are equal (Aha moment!). Let's try setting \\(x = y\\) to check.\n\nGiven \\(x + y = 10\\), setting \\(x = y\\) gives \\(x = y = 5\\). This leads to evaluating:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Check and Verify**\n\nOkay, it seems like we might have found the minimum. But let's crosscheck this with a bit of calculus to be more certain (let's verify the hunch):\n\nConsider the function \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{10-x}\\).\n- Find the derivative \\(f'(x)\\):\n\\[\nf'(x) = -\\frac{1}{x^2} + \\frac{1}{(10-x)^2}.\n\\]\n\nSet \\(f'(x) = 0\\) to find critical points:\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{x^2} = \\frac{1}{(10-x)^2}.\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\\[\n(10-x)^2 = x^2.\n\\]\nTaking the square root (considering only positive roots as \\(x, y > 0\\)):\n\\[ \n10 - x = x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 10 = 2x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 5. \n\\]\n\nCheck the second derivative \\(f''(x)\\) to confirm it's a minimum:\n\\[\nf''(x) = \\frac{2}{x^3} + \\frac{2}{(10-x)^3}.\n\\]\n\nEvaluate at \\(x = 5\\):\n\\[\nf''(5) = \\frac{2}{5^3} + \\frac{2}{5^3} = \\frac{4}{125} > 0,\n\\]\nwhich confirms a local minimum.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nReflecting on this, the symmetry trick and calculus confirmation align. Thus, the minimum value of \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}\\) given \\(x + y = 10\\) is indeed \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\).\n\nBy systematic checking and considering various approaches, we've confidently arrived at the correct answer.",
