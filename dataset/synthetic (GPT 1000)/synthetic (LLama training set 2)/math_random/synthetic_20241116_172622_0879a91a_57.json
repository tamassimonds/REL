    "working_out": "First thoughts: \n\nAlright, we have a cube with numbers on its faces and products on its vertices. We need to connect these somehow. The goal is to find the sum of the numbers on the faces, and we know the sum of the products on the vertices equals 1001. This problem relates to combining each vertex\u2019s three-face values to reach certain products and then relating it back to the sum of face values.\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry:**\n\n   - A cube has 6 faces and 8 vertices.\n   - Each vertex of the cube is where three edges meet, which means three faces intersect at each vertex. \n   - If 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f' are the numbers on the faces, each distinct vertex will have a product of three of these numbers.\n\n2. **Product of Each Vertex:**\n\n   - For any cube vertex, the number product will be of three distinct face numbers forming that vertex.\n   - There are \\(8\\) different vertices: for example, (a, b, c), (a, b, d), (a, e, c), etc., in all different permutations considering opposite sides and so on.\n   - The sum of these products is given as 1001.\n\n3. **Exploring Cube Symmetry:**\n\n   - Due to symmetry, many such sums or products can be calculated to be identical. \n   - If the numbers on opposite faces (like 'a' opposite 'd', 'b' opposite 'e', 'c' opposite 'f') interact, it could be pivotal to some rearrangement or simplification later.\n\n4. **Equations and Algebraic Formulation:**\n\n   - There is a classic algebra symmetry: Consider two face groups: (a, b, c) and their opposite (d, e, f), contributing like a cubic finite plane problem. It might follow (a+b+c+d+e+f).\n   - Since each vertex product considers three numbers, a sensible systematic approach can be multiplying potential component sums and symmetries.\n\n5. **Trying a Direct Algebra Relation:**\n\n   - A breakthrough moment: When face numbers symmetric opposite, they often tend to simplify outputs. \n   - Let\u2019s do permutations and try basic sums, trial-and-error: If one can express the vertex product situation involving sums like:\n     - (abc + abd + aef + bcd + ... ).\n   - This can sometimes elegantly reduce.\n\n6. **Exploring Check and Reflect:**\n\n   - Wait a minute: often if each vertex comes symmetrically and 's' is (a+b+c), and 't' accordingly (d+e+f) \u2013 potentially turning symmetrically into double factorials or pair products \u2013 an actionable strategy might evolve from examining polynomial symmetry properties:\n     - Product summation simplics can tie down as n(n-1)/2 easily yielding factor multiple total like an equilibro polynomial symmetry insight.\n\n7. **Verification and Conclusion:**\n\n   - Since the sum is consistently based on the absolute symmetric arrangement of typical 2D or 3D symmetric algebra and yields coherent results for composing whole sums once evenly distinguished, leading sum totals of this feature generally check out.\n\n8. **Applying a Known Insight:**\n\n   - Finally: if the sum of bean products equal precisely 1001 over factor equivalence discovery due to simplification and well-understood cube behaviors, each sum value of a + b + c + d + e + f elegantly adds to a cohesive 3-diagonally symmetric arrangement leading face-diagonal completeness expected to visually add through symmetrical predictives.\n\nThus, finally contemplating our cube geometry and layout, verifying extends 42 usually ties face-wise balances in given verified orientations. Conclusively: \n**The sum of the numbers written on the faces is** \\(42\\).\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous approach. Let's revisit the problem with fresh eyes and organize my thoughts to find the correct solution.\n\n**Reanalyzing the Problem:**\n\nWe are given a cube with numbers on each face, and the sum of the products at each vertex equals 1001. Our task is to find the sum of the numbers on the faces.\n\n**Revisiting the Structure:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Layout:**\n   - The cube has 6 faces and 8 vertices. Each vertex is formed by the product of numbers from three adjacent faces.\n   - Let's designate the numbers on opposite faces as pairs: \\(a\\) and \\(d\\), \\(b\\) and \\(e\\), \\(c\\) and \\(f\\).\n\n2. **Algebraic Expression:**\n   - The product at each vertex is formed by choosing numbers from each pair of opposite faces. Therefore, the sum 1001 can be rewritten as:\n     \\[\n     abc + aec + abf + aef + dbc + dec + dbf + def\n     \\]\n   - This expression can be factored into:\n     \\[\n     (a+d)(b+e)(c+f) = 1001\n     \\]\n\n3. **Decomposing the Sum:**\n   - We know \\(1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13\\). \n   - Thus, we can match this to \\((a+d), (b+e), (c+f)\\).\n\n4. **Testing Possibilities and Reflecting:**\n   - If \\((a+d) = 7\\), \\((b+e) = 11\\), \\((c+f) = 13\\), then:\n     \\[\n     (a+d) + (b+e) + (c+f) = 7 + 11 + 13 = 31\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verification and Conclusion:**\n   - By verifying our new approach aligns with the problem's constraints and given conditions, it holds that:\n     - The sum of the numbers on the faces aligns with the combinations and products given.\n   - Therefore, the sum of the numbers written on the faces is \\(\\boxed{31}\\).\n\nThis method harmonizes better with the problem requirements and verifies the correctness of the calculations. After reflecting on the relationships between opposite face pairs and leveraging the factorization of 1001, I am confident this solution accurately represents the cube's numerical configuration.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the values on one pair of opposite faces be $a$ and $d$; the second pair of faces, $b$ and $e$, and the third pair of faces, $c$ and $f$. There are eight vertices on the cube, so we find that the sum 1001 is equal to $$abc + aec + abf + aef + dbc + dec + dbf + def.$$ For any two faces adjacent at a vertex with $a$, the same two faces are adjacent to a vertex with $d$. Furthermore, any three adjacent faces must contain one of $a$ or $d$. Therefore, every term contains $a$ or $d$, and the expression is symmetric in $a$ and $d$. Considering the expression as a polynomial in $a$ (with the remaining variables fixed), we observe that $P(-d)=0$. Therefore, $a+d$ divides the given expression. Similarly, $b+e$ and $c+f$ divide the given expression as well. Therefore, $$abc + aec + abf + aef + dbc + dec + dbf + def = k(a+d)(b+e)(c+f).$$ Here, since both sides are of degree three in their variables, $k$ must be a constant, which is easily seen to be $1$.\n\nIt follows that $(a+d)(b+e)(c+f) = 1001 = 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$. Since each of the variables is positive, we have $a+d > 1, b+e > 1,$ and  $c+f > 1$. Thus $(a+d)+(b+e)+(c+f) = 7 + 11 + 13 = \\boxed{31}$."
