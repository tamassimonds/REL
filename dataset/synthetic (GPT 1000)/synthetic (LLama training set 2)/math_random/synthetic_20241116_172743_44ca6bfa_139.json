We need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numbers 2835 and 8960. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- When thinking of finding a GCF, the first things that come to mind are the prime factorization method and the Euclidean algorithm. \n- Prime factorization involves breaking down each number into its prime factors, then finding the common factors. \n- The Euclidean algorithm is more of a shortcut that involves repeated division.\n\nSince both methods are viable, let's brainstorm a bit on which might be more straightforward for these numbers.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Prime Factorization:** This method helps me think in terms of the building blocks of numbers. However, both numbers seem large, and breaking them into prime factors might be cumbersome unless I use a calculator.\n- **Euclidean Algorithm:** This method is efficient and might be easier with large numbers. The process involves division and is generally less tedious for bigger numbers. \n\nLet's start with the Euclidean algorithm and see how that goes. If it doesn't work out well or seems too complex, we'll reconsider prime factorization.\n\n**Using the Euclidean Algorithm:**\n1. **Understand the Division Process:**\n   - The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCF of two numbers also divides their difference.\n   - The algorithm states: GCF(a, b) = GCF(b, a mod b).\n   \n2. **Apply the Algorithm:**\n   - Start with the two numbers: 8960 and 2835.\n   - Divide 8960 by 2835, and find the remainder.\n     - \\( 8960 \\div 2835 = 3 \\), remainder \\( 455 \\). \n     - Thought: Remainder makes sense and is smaller than 2835, let\u2019s continue.\n\n3. **Next Step:**\n   - Apply the algorithm: GCF(2835, 455).\n   - Divide 2835 by 455.\n     - \\( 2835 \\div 455 = 6 \\), remainder \\( 120 \\).\n     - Thought: Remainder is now 120, seems like progress.\n\n4. **Continue the Process:**\n   - Apply the algorithm: GCF(455, 120).\n   - Divide 455 by 120.\n     - \\( 455 \\div 120 = 3 \\), remainder \\( 95 \\).\n     - Check if \\( 95 \\) is less than \\( 120 \\), it is, so far so good.\n\n5. **Keep Going:**\n   - Apply: GCF(120, 95).\n   - Divide 120 by 95.\n     - \\( 120 \\div 95 = 1 \\), remainder \\( 25 \\).\n     - Thought: Oh, the remainder seems small, hopefully close to the GCF.\n\n6. **Narrowing Down:**\n   - Apply: GCF(95, 25).\n   - Divide 95 by 25.\n     - \\( 95 \\div 25 = 3 \\), remainder \\( 20 \\).\n     - Remainder of 20 seems promising.\n\n7. **Final Steps:**\n   - Apply: GCF(25, 20).\n   - Divide 25 by 20.\n     - \\( 25 \\div 20 = 1 \\), remainder \\( 5 \\).\n     - Okay, we\u2019re getting almost there.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - Apply: GCF(20, 5).\n   - This divides evenly: \\( 20 \\div 5 = 4 \\), remainder \\( 0 \\).\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCF. Thus, GCF(2835, 8960) is 5.\n\n**Reflections:**\n- The Euclidean algorithm worked quite effectively, and the process was systematic.\n- No glaring mathematical errors jumped out during my calculations.\n- It looks like the GCF being 5 makes sense, especially given the step-by-step division checks.\n- The output seems a manageable number considering the large numbers initially involved.\n\nThere we go, the greatest common factor (GCF) of 2835 and 8960 is 5. That was an insightful solution route using the Euclidean algorithm!\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. The Euclidean algorithm is a valid approach, but it seems there was a misstep in my calculations. Let's go through the process again, and I'll re-evaluate using another strategy to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem:**\n\n**Initial Approach:**\n- Originally, I applied the Euclidean algorithm and concluded that the greatest common factor (GCF) of 2835 and 8960 was 5, but let's take another closer look.\n- Let's consider prime factorization as an alternative strategy. This might give us more insight into the structure of these numbers.\n\n**Re-Analysis with Prime Factorization:**\n1. **2835 Breakdown:**\n   - Start by dividing by the smallest prime, 5: \n     \\[\n     2835 \\div 5 = 567\n     \\]\n   - Next, continue with 567, checking for divisibility by 3:\n     \\[\n     567 \\div 3 = 189 \\quad \\text{(and again)}, \\quad 189 \\div 3 = 63, \\quad 63 \\div 3 = 21, \\quad 21 \\div 3 = 7\n     \\]\n   - So, \\(2835 = 5 \\times 3^4 \\times 7\\).\n\n2. **8960 Breakdown:**\n   - Start by dividing by 5: \n     \\[\n     8960 \\div 5 = 1792\n     \\]\n   - Divide 1792 by 2 repeatedly:\n     \\[\n     1792 \\div 2 = 896, \\quad 896 \\div 2 = 448, \\quad 448 \\div 2 = 224, \\quad 224 \\div 2 = 112, \\quad 112 \\div 2 = 56, \\quad 56 \\div 2 = 28, \\quad 28 \\div 2 = 14, \\quad 14 \\div 2 = 7\n     \\]\n   - So, \\(8960 = 2^8 \\times 5 \\times 7\\).\n\n**Reflecting on the Prime Factors:**\n- Looking at the prime factors, both numbers share the factors 5 and 7.\n- Calculating the product of these common factors: \n  \\[\n   5 \\times 7 = 35\n  \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Through re-evaluation and the application of the prime factorization method, the actual greatest common factor of 2835 and 8960 is \\( \\boxed{35} \\).\n- This makes sense as both numbers have 5 and 7 as common factors, and hence why the initial conclusion with the Euclidean algorithm was an oversight.\n\nThus, by exploring different strategies and cross-verifying using prime factorization, I've arrived at the correct solution. This process has highlighted the importance of checking calculations and being open to switching methods when necessary.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. My initial approach using the Euclidean algorithm led me to conclude that the greatest common factor (GCF) of 2835 and 8960 was 5, but let's re-evaluate this to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Revisiting the Problem:**\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\nGiven the size of these numbers, my first approach was to use the Euclidean algorithm, but reflecting on it, I realize I may not have executed it correctly. So, let's consider alternative strategies for a fresh perspective.\n\n**Re-Analysis with Prime Factorization:**\n\n1. **2835 Breakdown:**\n   - I previously found the factorization of 2835 to be \\(5 \\times 3^4 \\times 7\\). Let's confirm this by checking divisibility.\n   - Starting with division by 5:\n     \\[\n     2835 \\div 5 = 567\n     \\]\n   - Next, dividing by 3 iteratively:\n     \\[\n     567 \\div 3 = 189, \\quad 189 \\div 3 = 63, \\quad 63 \\div 3 = 21, \\quad 21 \\div 3 = 7\n     \\]\n   - Thus, confirming \\(2835 = 5 \\times 3^4 \\times 7\\).\n\n2. **8960 Breakdown:**\n   - I initially broke 8960 down to \\(2^8 \\times 5 \\times 7\\) through division.\n   - Starting with division by 5:\n     \\[\n     8960 \\div 5 = 1792\n     \\]\n   - Dividing 1792 by 2 repeatedly:\n     \\[\n     1792 \\div 2 = 896, \\quad 896 \\div 2 = 448, \\quad 448 \\div 2 = 224, \\quad 224 \\div 2 = 112, \\quad 112 \\div 2 = 56, \\quad 56 \\div 2 = 28, \\quad 28 \\div 2 = 14, \\quad 14 \\div 2 = 7\n     \\]\n   - Thus, confirming \\(8960 = 2^8 \\times 5 \\times 7\\).\n\n**Reflecting on the Prime Factors:**\n\n- After verifying the prime factorizations of both numbers, I can see they share the common factors of 5 and 7.\n- Calculating the product of these common factors confirms that:\n  \\[\n   5 \\times 7 = 35\n  \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThrough this re-evaluation using prime factorization, the actual greatest common factor of 2835 and 8960 is \\( \\boxed{35} \\). This makes more sense as both numbers clearly have 5 and 7 as common factors, and it aligns with the new insights gained from the reconsidered approach.\n\nReflecting on this process highlights the importance of cross-checking calculations and considering multiple strategies for solving mathematical problems.

  "ground_truth": "We notice immediately that both terms are divisible by $5$: $2835 = 5 \\cdot 567$ and $8960 = 5 \\cdot 1792$. Repeatedly dividing 1792 by 2,  we find that $1792/2^8 = 7$, so $8960 = 2^8 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. At this point, we are almost done: we know that $2$ does not divide into $2835$, so the only other factor we need to check is $7$. Since $2835 = 28 \\cdot 100 + 35$ is clearly divisible by $7$, then the greatest common factor is $5 \\times 7 = \\boxed{35}$."
