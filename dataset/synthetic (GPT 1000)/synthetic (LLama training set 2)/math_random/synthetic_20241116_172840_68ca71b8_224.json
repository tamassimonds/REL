    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. \n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nFirst, let's break down what the problem is asking. We have a shirt with an original price of $30. It goes on sale for 20% off, and Mary has a coupon for an additional 25% off the sale price. We need to find a single equivalent percentage discount that results in the same final price as applying these two discounts successively.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:** The problem is about applying successive percentage discounts and finding an equivalent single discount. This sounds like either a compounded percentage problem or a problem of multiplying percentages in a specific order.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Sale Price After the First Discount\n\nThe shirt is originally priced at $30. The first discount is 20%. \n\n1. **Calculate 20% of $30:**\n\n   \\[\n   0.20 \\times 30 = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract this from the original price:**\n\n   \\[\n   30 - 6 = 24\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, so the price after the first 20% discount is $24. This seems straightforward, but I need to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Second Discount\n\nNext, Mary applies her coupon, which gives an additional 25% off the sale price of $24.\n\n1. **Calculate 25% of $24:**\n\n   \\[\n   0.25 \\times 24 = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract this from the sale price:**\n\n   \\[\n   24 - 6 = 18\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:** So, the final price after both discounts is $18. I\u2019ll check again to confirm \u2013 I first found 25% of $24 and subtracted. Nothing seems off here.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Equivalent Single Discount\n\nNow, we need to find a single discount rate that would reduce the original price of $30 directly to $18.\n\n1. **Set up the equation:**\n\n   Let \\( x \\) be the single discount rate, then:\n\n   \\[\n   30 \\times (1 - x) = 18\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   1 - x = \\frac{18}{30}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   1 - x = 0.6\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   x = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   x = 40\\%\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:** After calculating, it turns out that a 40% discount reduces the price from $30 to $18. This makes sense considering both discounts together substantially lower the price, but let\u2019s reflect on why this works mathematically.\n\n### Step 5: Verification\n\nBefore concluding, let's verify by independently calculating if the 40% discount would indeed lead to $18.\n\n1. **Calculate 40% of $30:**\n\n   \\[\n   0.40 \\times 30 = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract this from $30:**\n\n   \\[\n   30 - 12 = 18\n   \\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:** The calculations checked out, and reaching the same result through different methods confirms accuracy. Each step logically follows from the process of compounded discounts.\n\nThis detailed step-by-step approach helped me clearly work through the problem and ensured the solution (a 40% single equivalent discount) was correct. It\u2019s always good to verify like this to catch any potential errors early.",

  "ground_truth": "Applying a $20\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $1-20\\%=1-0.2=\\frac{4}{5}$.  Similarly, applying a $25\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $\\frac{3}{4}$.  Applying both discounts, we multiply by $\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{3}{5}=0.6$.  Since $1-0.6=0.4=40\\%$, multiplying by 0.6 gives a $\\boxed{40\\%}$ discount."
