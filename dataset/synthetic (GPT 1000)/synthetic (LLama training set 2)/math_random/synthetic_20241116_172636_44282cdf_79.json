    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together and break it down step by step. I'm going to approach this as if I'm tackling a problem for the first time, trying to brainstorm different strategies, and thinking through this process just like I would naturally.\n\n### Understanding the Problem:\n1. **Initial Thoughts:**\n   - This problem involves ceiling and floor functions, which means we're dealing with rounding numbers up and down.\n   - We have two main expressions to evaluate and then subtract the results of these evaluations: \n     1. \\(\\left \\lceil \\frac{12}{7} \\cdot \\frac{-29}{3}\\right\\rceil\\)\n     2. \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{12}{7} \\cdot \\left \\lfloor \\frac{-29}{3}\\right \\rfloor \\right \\rfloor\\)\n\n2. **Complex Expression:**\n   - These expressions include fractions, multiplication, and the floor function within the second expression. Thus, it's a multi-layered problem requiring sequential computations.\n\n### Strategy Outline:\n- I should first resolve the inner computations such as \\(\\frac{-29}{3}\\) and then apply the floor or ceiling functions.\n- After simplifying each part, substitute back into the main expressions.\n- Finally, compute the difference between the results from the two main expressions.\n\n### Calculating Step-by-Step:\n1. **Evaluate \\(\\frac{-29}{3}\\):**\n   - Division: \\(-29 \\div 3 = -9.6667\\) approximately.\n   - **Floor function application:** \\(\\left \\lfloor -9.6667 \\right \\rfloor = -10\\)\n   - This equates to the largest integer less than or equal to \\(-9.6667\\).\n\n2. **First Expression: \\(\\left \\lceil \\frac{12}{7} \\cdot \\frac{-29}{3}\\right\\rceil\\):**\n   - Calculate: \\(\\frac{12}{7} = 1.7142857\\)\n   - Multiply by \\(-29/3:\\)\n     \\[\n     1.7142857 \\times -9.6667 \\approx -16.5714286\n     \\]\n   - Ceiling function: \n     - Now apply \\(\\left \\lceil -16.5714286 \\right \\rceil = -16\\)\n     - Since it's a ceiling function, it rounds to the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(-16.5714286\\).\n\n3. **Second Expression: \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{12}{7} \\cdot \\left \\lfloor \\frac{-29}{3}\\right \\rfloor \\right \\rfloor\\):**\n   - We already calculated \\(\\left \\lfloor \\frac{-29}{3}\\right \\rfloor = -10\\).\n   - Now substitute the floor result: \\(\\frac{12}{7} \\times -10 = -17.1428571\\)\n   - Apply floor function:\n     - \\(\\left\\lfloor -17.1428571 \\right\\rfloor = -18\\)\n     - Here, the floor function rounds to the largest integer less than or equal to \\(-17.1428571\\).\n\n### Final Calculation:\n- Compute the difference between these two evaluations:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Result} = -16 - (-18) = -16 + 18 = 2\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe answer to the given problem is \\(2\\).\n\nThroughout this problem, I consistently checked each step for potential mistakes and logic errors\u2014especially in rounding with the ceiling and floor functions\u2014feeling confident the approach was correct given the problem type.",

  "ground_truth": "Evaluating the first term, $\\frac {12}7 \\cdot \\frac{-29}{3} = \\frac{-116}{7}$. Since $$-17 = \\frac{-119}{7} < \\frac{-116}{7} < \\frac{-112}{7} = -16,$$ the ceiling of $\\frac{-116}{7}$ is $-16$.\n\nIn the second term, since $$-10 = \\frac{-30}{3} < \\frac{-29}{3} < \\frac{-27}{3} = -9,$$ then the floor of $\\frac{-29}3$ is $-10$. The product of this with $\\frac{12}{7}$ is $\\frac{-120}{7}$. Since $$-18 = \\frac{-126}{7} < \\frac{-120}{7} < \\frac{-119}{7} = -17,$$ the floor of $\\frac{-120}{7}$ is $-18$. Hence, the answer is $-16 - (-18) = \\boxed{2}$."
