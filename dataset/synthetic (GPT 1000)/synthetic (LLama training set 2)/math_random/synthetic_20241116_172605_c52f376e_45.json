    "working_out": "### Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem! We're given two quadratic expressions and need to find the value of \\( h \\) in a transformed expression. \n\nFirstly, the problem is connecting the given form \\( 2(x - 4)^2 + 8 \\) with another quadratic \\( 3ax^2 + 3bx + 3c \\). The way these quadratics are expressed in terms of perfect squares is fascinating. They remind me of completing the square, a common technique needed to convert quadratic expressions to vertex form, \\( a(x-h)^2 + k \\).\n\nThe problem suggests that there is a scaling or transformation happening between the two quadratics, especially because of the factor of 3. So, intuitively, figuring out the expansions and comparing coefficients seems like the right approach.\n\n### Step 1: Expand the Given Expression\n\nLet's start with the expression given in vertex form: \n\\[ 2(x - 4)^2 + 8. \\]\n\nWe'll expand this to try and find a link to a standard quadratic form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n1. Expand \\( (x - 4)^2 \\):\n   \\[ (x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16. \\]\n\n2. Multiply by 2:\n   \\[ 2(x^2 - 8x + 16) = 2x^2 - 16x + 32. \\]\n\n3. Add 8:\n   \\[ 2x^2 - 16x + 32 + 8 = 2x^2 - 16x + 40. \\]\n\nSo, the standard form of the expression is \\( 2x^2 - 16x + 40 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Express \\( 3ax^2 + 3bx + 3c \\) and Compare\n\nWe know \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is equivalent to \\( 2x^2 - 16x + 40 \\). Let's multiply the entire expression by 3 to create \\( 3ax^2 + 3bx + 3c \\):\n\\[ 3(2x^2 - 16x + 40) = 6x^2 - 48x + 120. \\]\n\nNext, our goal is to express this as \\( n(x-h)^2 + k \\).\n\n### Step 3: Completing the Square\n\nI'll first write \\( 6x^2 - 48x + 120 \\) in terms of a perfect square:\n\n1. Factor out the leading coefficient (6) from the quadratic and linear terms:\n   \\[ 6(x^2 - 8x) + 120. \\]\n\n2. Find what completes the square inside the parentheses. For \\( x^2 - 8x \\), take half of \\(-8\\), square it:\n   \\[ \\left(\\frac{-8}{2}\\right)^2 = 16. \\]\n\n3. Add and subtract 16 inside the parentheses:\n   \\[ 6(x^2 - 8x + 16 - 16) + 120 = 6((x-4)^2 - 16) + 120. \\]\n\n4. Distribute the 6:\n   \\[ 6(x - 4)^2 - 96 + 120. \\]\n\n5. Simplify:\n   \\[ 6(x - 4)^2 + 24. \\]\n\nThere we have the expression in the form \\( n(x-h)^2 + k \\). It matches the format given in the problem, and we see clearly that \\( h = 4 \\).\n\n### Checking Work\n\nTo ensure everything checks out, I'll briefly think through it again:\n- Initial expansion and multiplication steps aligned with what I expected from vertex to standard form.\n- Completing the square didn't seem to throw any discrepancies.\n- Derived the expected transformation successfully with expected values for \\( h \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the value of \\( h \\) is \\( \\boxed{4} \\). Everything fits into place considering how we translated and transformed the expressions. The recognized patterns and operations followed correctly, giving confidence that the method and calculation were solid.",

  "ground_truth": "We have that $ax^2 + bx + c = 2(x - 4)^2 + 8$.  Multiplying both sides by 3, we get \\[3ax^2 + 3bx + 3c = 6(x - 4)^2 + 24.\\]The value of $h$, namely $\\boxed{4}$, remains exactly the same."
