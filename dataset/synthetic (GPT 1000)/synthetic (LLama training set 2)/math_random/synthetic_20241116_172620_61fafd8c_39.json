    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step. The problem is asking us to determine for which positive integer values of \\( k \\), the quadratic equation \\( kx^2 + 20x + k = 0 \\) has rational solutions. Let's break it down.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst thoughts: This is a quadratic equation in the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), where \\( a = k \\), \\( b = 20 \\), and \\( c = k \\). I need to consider the conditions for the solutions of a quadratic equation to be rational. The rationality condition usually ties back to the discriminant.\n\n### Step 2: Using the Discriminant\n\nFor any quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is given by \\( b^2 - 4ac \\). The solutions are rational if and only if \\(\\Delta\\) is a perfect square.\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\\[ \\Delta = 20^2 - 4(k)(k) = 400 - 4k^2. \\]\n\nFor the solutions to be rational, \\( 400 - 4k^2 \\) must be a perfect square. Let's set this up as:\n\\[ 400 - 4k^2 = n^2 \\]\nfor some integer \\( n \\).\n\nRearranging this, we get:\n\\[ 400 - n^2 = 4k^2 \\]\n\\[ 4k^2 = 400 - n^2 \\]\n\\[ k^2 = \\frac{400 - n^2}{4} \\]\n\\[ k^2 = 100 - \\frac{n^2}{4} \\]\n\nFor \\( k^2 \\) to be an integer, \\( \\frac{n^2}{4} \\) must be an integer, which implies \\( n^2 \\) must be a multiple of 4.\n\n### Step 3: Finding Integer Solutions\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think. I need \\( n^2 \\) to be perfect squares such that \\( n^2 \\leq 400 \\). So \\( n \\) could be any integer from \\( 0 \\) to \\( 20 \\). Also, \\( n \\) needs to be even so that \\( n^2 \\) is divisible by 4.\n\nLet's list some values: \\( n = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 \\).\n\nNow check each: \n\n\\[ k^2 = 100 - \\frac{0^2}{4} = 100 \\rightarrow k = 10 \\]\n\n\\[ k^2 = 100 - \\frac{2^2}{4} = 99 \\text{ (not perfect square)} \\]\n\n\\[ k^2 = 100 - \\frac{4^2}{4} = 96 \\text{ (not perfect square)} \\]\n\n\\[ k^2 = 100 - \\frac{6^2}{4} = 91 \\text{ (not perfect square)} \\]\n\n\\[ k^2 = 100 - \\frac{8^2}{4} = 84 \\text{ (not perfect square)} \\]\n\n\\[ k^2 = 100 - \\frac{10^2}{4} = 75 \\text{ (not perfect square)} \\]\n\n\\[ k^2 = 100 - \\frac{12^2}{4} = 64 \\rightarrow k = 8 \\]\n\n\\[ k^2 = 100 - \\frac{14^2}{4} = 49 \\rightarrow k = 7 \\]\n\n\\[ k^2 = 100 - \\frac{16^2}{4} = 36 \\rightarrow k = 6 \\]\n\n\\[ k^2 = 100 - \\frac{18^2}{4} = 19 \\text{ (not perfect square)} \\]\n\n\\[ k^2 = 100 - \\frac{20^2}{4} = 0 \\rightarrow k = 0 \\text{ (but \\( k \\) must be positive)} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Verifying Solutions\n\nThe values of \\( k \\) that work are \\( 6, 7, 8 \\), and \\( 10 \\).\n\n- For \\( k = 6 \\), \\(\\Delta = 36\\), which is a perfect square.\n- For \\( k = 7 \\), \\(\\Delta = 49\\), which is a perfect square.\n- For \\( k = 8 \\), \\(\\Delta = 64\\), which is a perfect square.\n- For \\( k = 10 \\), \\(\\Delta = 100\\), which is a perfect square.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe integer values of \\( k \\) for which the equation has rational solutions are:\n\n\\[ k = 6, 7, 8, 10 \\]\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's revisit the problem and correct it by re-evaluating the situation.\n\n### Step 5: Revisiting the Problem\n\nTo ensure that the quadratic equation \\( kx^2 + 20x + k = 0 \\) has rational solutions, the discriminant \\( \\Delta = 400 - 4k^2 \\) must be a perfect square. My previous approach was a bit off, so let me think through this again carefully.\n\n### Brainstorming a New Approach\n\nFirstly, let's ensure I've properly considered the range for \\( k \\). Since we're looking for positive integer values of \\( k \\), it might help to directly handle the constraints.\n\n**Step 6: Refining the Validity of Values for \\( k \\)**\n\nI need to ensure that the discriminant \\( 400 - 4k^2 \\) is a non-negative perfect square. To do so, the expression inside the square root should equate to a perfect square, say \\( m^2 \\), leading us to:\n\\[\n400 - 4k^2 = m^2 \\quad \\text{where \\( m \\) is an integer.}\n\\]\n\nRewriting it,\n\\[\n4k^2 = 400 - m^2.\n\\]\n\nThis implies that for the discriminant to be perfect square:\n\\[\n4k^2 = 400 - m^2\n\\]\n\nThis can be re-arranged as:\n\\[\nk^2 = 100 - \\frac{m^2}{4}.\n\\]\n\nObserving that \\( \\frac{m^2}{4} \\) must be an integer, suggesting \\( m^2 \\) should be a multiple of 4. Also, \\( 100 - \\frac{m^2}{4} \\) must be a perfect square for \\( k^2 \\).\n\n### Step 7: Listing Integer Possibilities for \\( m \\)\n\nLet's go with a simpler approach: checking integer values directly.\n\n- For \\( m = 0 \\), \\( 100 - 0 = 100 \\rightarrow k = 10 \\).\n- For \\( m = 4 \\), \\( 100 - 4 = 96 \\text{ (not a perfect square)} \\).\n- For \\( m = 8 \\), \\( 100 - 16 = 84 \\text{ (not a perfect square)} \\).\n- For \\( m = 12 \\), \\( 100 - 36 = 64 \\rightarrow k = 8 \\).\n- For \\( m = 14 \\), \\( 100 - 49 = 51 \\text{ (not a perfect square)} \\).\n- For \\( m = 16 \\), \\( 100 - 64 = 36 \\rightarrow k = 6 \\).\n- For \\( m = 20 \\), \\( 100 - 100 = 0 \\rightarrow k = 0 \\text{ (but \\( k \\) must be positive)} \\).\n\n### Step 8: Verifying the Correct Subset\n\nThis strategy gives the potential candidates \\( k = 6, 8, \\) and \\( 10 \\) only. Let me cross-check that these work:\n\n- **For \\( k = 6 \\):** The discriminant is \\( 400 - 4(6)^2 = 400 - 144 = 256 \\), which is \\( 16^2 \\) (a perfect square).\n- **For \\( k = 8 \\):** The discriminant is \\( 400 - 4(8)^2 = 400 - 256 = 144 \\), which is \\( 12^2 \\) (a perfect square).\n- **For \\( k = 10 \\):** The discriminant is \\( 400 - 4(10)^2 = 400 - 400 = 0 \\), which is \\( 0^2 \\) (a perfect square).\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe correct integer values of \\( k \\) for which the equation has rational solutions are \\( \\boxed{6, 8, \\text{and } 10} \\). Thank you for catching that oversight and prompting me to re-evaluate the solution!",

  "ground_truth": "By considering the expression $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the solutions of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we find that the solutions are rational if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ has a rational square root. Therefore, the solutions of $kx^2+20x+k=0$ are rational if and only if $400-4(k)(k)$ is a perfect square. (Recall that if $n$ is an integer which is not a perfect square, then $\\sqrt{n}$ is irrational).  By writing the discriminant as $4(100-k^2)$, we see that we only need to check the integers $1\\leq k\\leq 10$.  Of these, $\\boxed{6, 8\\text{, and }10}$ work."
