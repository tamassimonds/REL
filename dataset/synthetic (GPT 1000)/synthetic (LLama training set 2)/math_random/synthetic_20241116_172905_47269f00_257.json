    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem carefully by analyzing the function \\( y = \\frac{x^3 - 27}{x + 27} \\). \n\n### Initial Thoughts\n\nFirst look at this, and the immediate place to start analyzing is the denominator since we're dealing with a rational function. Denominators cannot be zero because division by zero is undefined. So, my first step is to check under what condition \\( x+27 = 0 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Undefined Points\n\nTo find when the function is undefined, consider:\n\n\\[ x + 27 = 0 \\]\n\nSolving this gives:\n\n\\[ x = -27 \\]\n\nThis means the function is undefined when \\( x = -27 \\). At this point, I'll have to exclude \\( x = -27 \\) from the domain.\n\n### Reflection at this point\n\nSo far, so good. I've identified a restriction which makes sense. In rational functions, values that make the denominator zero are always excluded from the domain. This initial strategy seems correct.\n\n### Step 2: Checking the Numerator\n\nNext, let's consider the numerator, \\( x^3 - 27 \\). Even though the numerator doesn't affect the domain directly (as long as the denominator isn't zero), it's worth checking to see if there can be any simplifications, especially if \\( x + 27 \\) is a factor of it.\n\nThe numerator is a difference of cubes. It can be factored as:\n\n\\[ x^3 - 27 = (x - 3)(x^2 + 3x + 9) \\]\n\nThis doesn't really affect the domain directly, but let's match it to see if there's any simplification that can be made with the denominator \\( (x+27) \\). As suspected, the denominator isn\u2019t a factor of the numerator, so no cancellations occur.\n\n### The Eureka Moment!\n\nThere\u2019s a subtle property: if the numerator had exactly cancelled the denominator, it could impact continuity at that point or indicate a limit-based approach. However, this isn\u2019t the case here. \n\nLet\u2019s return to the main task of determining the domain. Since all our steps about the denominator held logical, our initial insight was correct. \n\n### Final Reflection on the Domain\n\nNot changing any strategies since identifying \\( x = -27 \\) already addressed the critical requirement. \n\n### Conclusion and Double-Check\n\nWith everything we've explored, the domain of the function \\( y = \\frac{x^3 - 27}{x + 27} \\) is all real numbers except \\( x = -27 \\). I'll express it in interval notation:\n\nThe domain is:\n\n\\[ (-\\infty, -27) \\cup (-27, \\infty) \\]\n\nI'm confident in this result; every rational function follows similar principles, and all our reflections indicate this holds true here. This solution appears straightforwardly consistent.",

  "ground_truth": "The only values of $x$ that would make this fraction undefined are values that makes the denominator $0$. Therefore, the fraction is undefined when $x+27=0$, or when $x=-27$. Hence, the solution is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-27)\\cup(-27,\\infty)}$."
