    "working_out": "Alright, let's jump into this step-by-step process.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, we're looking for the eighth term in an arithmetic sequence that starts with the terms \\(\\frac{2}{3}, 1, \\frac{4}{3}, \\ldots\\). Arithmetic sequences are defined by having a constant difference between terms, so my first thought is to determine what that difference is. The challenge here is to discern whether this sequence follows a pattern I'm familiar with and whether there is a straightforward way to find the eighth term.\n\n**Step 1: Determine if there's a constant difference (the common difference):**\n\nLet me calculate the difference between the first two terms. The first term is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) and the second term is \\(1\\). To find the difference:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nAlright, the difference between the first and second term is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nNow, let's see if this difference holds between the second term (\\(1\\)) and the third term (\\(\\frac{4}{3}\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} - 1 = \\frac{4}{3} - \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nGreat, the difference is consistent. So, the common difference \\(d\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). \n\n**Step 2: Understand what it means for the sequence:**\n\nBased on this, the sequence progresses by adding \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) to each subsequent term. I feel confident this means we can use the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term in an arithmetic sequence, which is \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(d\\) is the common difference, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the eighth term using the formula:**\n\nLet's use the formula to find the eighth term (\\(a_8\\)). The first term \\(a_1 = \\frac{2}{3}\\), the common difference \\(d = \\frac{1}{3}\\), and \\(n = 8\\):\n\n\\[\na_8 = a_1 + (8-1)d = \\frac{2}{3} + 7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\(7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, substituting back into the formula:\n\n\\[\na_8 = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{2 + 7}{3} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection and Check:**\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Given that each step added \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), arriving at 3 for the eighth term seems plausible considering the sequence started at \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Let's do a quick mental check: the sequence starts at \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), progresses by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), leading up to the terms: \\(\\frac{2}{3}, 1, \\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{5}{3}, 2, \\frac{7}{3}, \\frac{8}{3}, 3\\). Yes, 3 as the eighth term lines up perfectly. \n\nMy conclusion feels sound. The eighth term in the sequence is \\(3\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe eighth term in the arithmetic sequence is \\(3\\).",
