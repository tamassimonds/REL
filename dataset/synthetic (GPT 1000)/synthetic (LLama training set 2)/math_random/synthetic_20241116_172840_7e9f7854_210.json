    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into the problem. Initially, it can feel somewhat abstract, so let's clarify what we're dealing with and systematically break it down.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nWe need to find angles \\(\\theta\\) such that \\(\\sin \\theta\\), \\(\\cos \\theta\\), and \\(\\tan \\theta\\) form a geometric sequence in some order, within the interval \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\), other than at integer multiples of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \n- \\(\\sin \\theta\\), \\(\\cos \\theta\\), \\(\\tan \\theta\\) are the primary trigonometric functions and can take various values as \\(\\theta\\) varies.\n- A geometric sequence means the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. This provides a specific relationship between the trigonometric values.\n- Excluding multiples of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) makes sense because \\(\\tan \\theta\\) could be undefined there.\n\n### Step 2: Possible Strategies and Formulation\n\n**Strategy 1: Assume Orderings Directly**\n- We could list possible orderings of \\(\\sin \\theta\\), \\(\\cos \\theta\\), and \\(\\tan \\theta\\).\n\n**Orderings:**\n1. \\(\\sin \\theta, \\cos \\theta, \\tan \\theta\\)\n2. \\(\\sin \\theta, \\tan \\theta, \\cos \\theta\\)\n3. \\(\\cos \\theta, \\sin \\theta, \\tan \\theta\\)\n4. \\(\\cos \\theta, \\tan \\theta, \\sin \\theta\\)\n5. \\(\\tan \\theta, \\sin \\theta, \\cos \\theta\\)\n6. \\(\\tan \\theta, \\cos \\theta, \\sin \\theta\\)\n\nEach ordering should satisfy the geometric progression condition. Let's start testing one and see where it leads us.\n\n### Step 3: Exploring the First Ordering\n\n**Assume \\( \\sin \\theta, \\cos \\theta, \\tan \\theta \\) is a geometric sequence.**\n\n- This means there exists a ratio \\( r \\) such that:\n  \\[\n  \\cos \\theta = r \\sin \\theta \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\tan \\theta = r^2 \\sin \\theta\n  \\]\n\n- Since \\(\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}\\), we have:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta} = r^2 \\sin \\theta \\Rightarrow \\cos \\theta = \\frac{1}{r^2}\n  \\]\n\n- Now, bring in \\(\\cos \\theta = r \\sin \\theta\\):\n  \\[\n  r \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{r^2}\n  \\Rightarrow \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{r^3}\n  \\]\n\n- Substitute \\(\\cos \\theta = r \\sin \\theta\\):\n  \\[\n  \\cos \\theta = \\frac{1}{r^2},\\quad \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{r^3}\n  \\]\n\nUsing the identity \\(\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{r^3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{r^2}\\right)^2 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{r^6} + \\frac{1}{r^4} = 1\n\\]\nMultiplying through by \\(r^6\\):\n\\[\n1 + r^2 = r^6\n\\]\nRearrange:\n\\[\nr^6 - r^2 - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Reflect and Attempt Solving the Equation\n\n*Don't forget to reflect.* This equation \\(r^6 - r^2 - 1 = 0\\) seems potentially solvable for real \\(r\\). We should factor or find a substitution for easier solving.\n\nTry substituting \\(x = r^2\\):\n\\[\nx^3 - x - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this polynomial equation for \\(x\\). This is a cubic and can be solved with techniques involving roots or numerical approaches like Newton\u2019s method. For simplicity, assume potential rational roots and check the behavior of the function.\n\n### Step 5: Verification and Finalization\n\nIf a feasible \\(r\\) (and, hence, \\(\\theta\\) from \\(\\sin\\) and \\(\\cos\\) values) emerges that satisfies the initial configuration and conditions, examine further:\n\n- Consider other geometrical configurations (i.e. switching \\(\\sin\\), \\(\\cos\\), \\(\\tan\\)) and repeated till every permutation is checked for potential new distinct solutions \\(\\theta\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe entire equation solving needs to be performed and checked for real solutions, which directly give us possible \\(\\theta\\) angles without being integer multiples of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Moreover, since this can get computational, careful equity verification should guarantee no angles miss due to periodic trigonometric behavior. Once verified, we collate all otherwise valid \\(\\theta\\) for our answer.\n\nAhh, I see I've made an error in my previous attempt. Let's re-evaluate the problem and explore various strategies to find a correct solution.\n\n### Re-examining the Problem\n\nWe need to determine angles \\(\\theta\\) such that \\(\\sin \\theta\\), \\(\\cos \\theta\\), and \\(\\tan \\theta\\) form a geometric sequence in any order. Importantly, these angles must lie within the interval \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\) and cannot be integer multiples of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), where \\(\\tan \\theta\\) is undefined.\n\n### Brainstorming Different Strategies\n\n#### Strategy 1: Check All Possible Orderings\n\nPreviously, I listed the possible orderings of \\(\\sin \\theta\\), \\(\\cos \\theta\\), and \\(\\tan \\theta\\). I'll explore each ordering systematically again and reflect on any missed possibilities:\n\n1. \\(\\sin \\theta, \\cos \\theta, \\tan \\theta\\)\n2. \\(\\sin \\theta, \\tan \\theta, \\cos \\theta\\)\n3. \\(\\cos \\theta, \\sin \\theta, \\tan \\theta\\)\n4. \\(\\cos \\theta, \\tan \\theta, \\sin \\theta\\)\n5. \\(\\tan \\theta, \\sin \\theta, \\cos \\theta\\)\n6. \\(\\tan \\theta, \\cos \\theta, \\sin \\theta\\)\n\nI will explore case by case, verifying geometric sequence conditions and confirming solutions.\n\n### Case 1: \\(\\sin \\theta \\tan \\theta = \\cos^2 \\theta\\)\n\n- This translates to \\(\\sin^2 \\theta = \\cos^3 \\theta\\). Letting \\(x = \\cos \\theta\\), the equation becomes:\n  \\[\n  x^3 + x^2 - 1 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- Analyze \\(f(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 1\\):\n  - For \\(x = 0\\), \\(f(0) = -1\\)\n  - For \\(x = 1\\), \\(f(1) = 1\\)\n  - \\(f(x)\\) is increasing in \\([0, 1]\\), implying exactly one real root in this interval.\n\nThis root corresponds to two angles \\(\\theta\\) within \\(0 \\leq \\theta < 2\\pi\\).\n\n### Case 2: \\(\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\tan^2 \\theta\\)\n\n- The equation becomes \\(\\cos^3 \\theta = \\sin \\theta\\).\n- Within \\(0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\pi \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\), the behavior of \\(\\sin \\theta\\) and \\(\\cos^3 \\theta\\) suggests one solution per interval.\n\n### Case 3: \\(\\cos \\theta \\tan \\theta = \\sin^2 \\theta\\)\n\n- This simplifies to \\(\\sin^2 \\theta = \\sin \\theta\\), leading to \\(\\sin \\theta = 0\\) or \\(1\\). However, \\(\\theta\\) being an integer multiple of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) is not allowed here.\n\n**Reflection:** Cases 1 and 2 provide non-trivial solutions, while Case 3 does not due to the restriction on multiples of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining results from these cases provides a total of 4 solutions, corresponding to the angles \\(\\theta\\) determined by the valid \\(x\\) solutions from Cases 1 and 2. Thus, there are 4 such angles that satisfy the conditions, confirming the solution \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
