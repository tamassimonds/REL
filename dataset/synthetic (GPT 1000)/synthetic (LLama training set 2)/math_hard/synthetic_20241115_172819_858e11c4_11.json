I'll write down my thoughts, reflect often, and change my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the question is about a survey of **100 people** regarding their perception of fuchsia. Here's what stands out:\n\n- **60 believe fuchsia is \"kinda pink.\"**\n- **27 believe it's both \"kinda pink\" and \"purply.\"**\n- **17 think it's neither \"kinda pink\" nor \"purply.\"**\n\nI need to determine how many of these 100 people believe that fuchsia is **\"purply.\"**\n\nInitially, I recall dealing with similar problems involving **Venn diagrams** or **sets**. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the right approach here. Maybe I should list out what's given and see how the pieces fit together. Let me explore a few strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use a Venn Diagram:** This seems like a classic set problem where overlapping beliefs can be visualized.\n\n2. **Set-Based Approach:** Utilize principles of set theory to calculate the number of people believing fuchsia is purply.\n\n3. **Logic and Elimination:** Perhaps logically deducing the numbers based on the given data without visual aids.\n\n4. **Algebraic Equations:** Set up equations to represent the relationships between different groups.\n\nHmm, I think starting with a **Venn diagram** might be intuitive since it visually represents overlaps. If that feels messy, I can switch to a **set-based approach** or **algebraic equations**. Let's try the Venn diagram first and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Drawing the Venn Diagram**\n\nOkay, picture this: I have two overlapping circles.\n\n- **Circle A** represents people who think fuchsia is \"kinda pink.\"\n- **Circle B** represents those who think fuchsia is \"purply.\"\n\n**Key Given Data:**\n\n1. **Total surveyed (U):** 100 people\n2. **|A| = 60:** People who think fuchsia is \"kinda pink.\"\n3. **|A \u2229 B| = 27:** People who think it's both \"kinda pink\" and \"purply.\"\n4. **17 think neither:** These people fall outside both circles.\n\nThinking about it, I realize I need to find **|B|**, the number of people who think fuchsia is \"purply.\" Hmm, this might be tricky because |B| isn't directly given.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Organizing the Information**\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n- **Total (U):** 100\n- **Total believing fuchsia is neither (outside A \u222a B):** 17\n- **|A| = 60:** Total in circle A\n- **|A \u2229 B| = 27:** Overlap between circles A and B\n\nWait, I notice that people who think **fuchsia is \"kinda pink\" but not \"purply\"** are part of **A but not B**. This could help me determine |B| by finding the total in B.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Maybe calculating the number of people in **A but not B** would be useful. Let's see if that leads somewhere.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating |A \\ B| (People Believing \"Kinda Pink\" Only)**\n\nI know that:\n\n\\[\n|A| = |A \\cap B| + |A \\setminus B| \n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n|A \\cap B| + |A \\setminus B| = 60\n\\]\n\nGiven **|A \u2229 B| = 27**, let's find **|A \\ B|**:\n\n\\[\n27 + |A \\setminus B| = 60 \n\\]\n\\[\n|A \\setminus B| = 60 - 27 = 33\n\\]\n\nThis means **33 people** think fuchsia is \"kinda pink\" but **not purply**.\n\nI'm starting to see a clearer picture. Maybe now I can find |B| by considering the total surveyed and those thinking neither.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Number of People in A \u222a B (Believing \"Kinda Pink\" or \"Purply\" or Both)**\n\nI know that:\n\n\\[\n|U| = |A \\cup B| + |Neither|\n\\]\n\\[\n|A \u222a B| = |U| - |Neither| = 100 - 17 = 83\n\\]\n\nSo, **83 people** believe fuchsia is either \"kinda pink,\" \"purply,\" or both.\n\nHmm, this step seems crucial because it gives me the total number in **A \u222a B**. Now, I can use this to find **|B|**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Applying the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to Find |B|**\n\nI remember that:\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\\]\n\nRearranging to find |B|:\n\n\\[\n|B| = |A \\cup B| - |A| + |A \u2229 B|\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s plug in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n|B| = 83 - 60 + 27\n\\]\n\\[\n|B| = 50\n\\]\n\nSo, according to this calculation, **50 people** believe that fuchsia is \"purply.\"\n\nWait a minute. Let me check this. Does it make sense?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Checking the Calculation**\n\nLet me briefly verify:\n\n- **Total surveyed:** 100\n- **Think neither:** 17\n- **So, thinking at least one side (A \u222a B):** 83\n- **Given |A| = 60** and **|A \u2229 B| = 27**, the calculation seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, is this consistent with the given data? Let me think.\n\nHmm, if **83 people** are in **A \u222a B**, and I calculated **50 in B**, that leaves **33 in A but not B**, which matches with the earlier calculation.\n\nOkay, this makes sense. The numbers align logically.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Reflecting on the Approach**\n\nAt first, using a **Venn diagram** helped visualize the overlaps, and applying the **principle of inclusion-exclusion** provided a clear path to calculating |B|.\n\nInitially, I thought I might get stuck determining |B| directly since it's not given. But by calculating **|A \u222a B|** first and then rearranging the inclusion-exclusion formula, I arrived at the solution.\n\nIf the Venn diagram approach felt too convoluted, I could have tried setting up **algebraic equations** or just logically deducing the relationships. But since this method worked, I'll stick with it.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the calculations:\n\n**50 people believe that fuchsia is \"purply.\"**\n\n**Summary of Steps:**\n\n1. **Drew a Venn diagram** to visualize the problem.\n2. **Calculated |A \\ B|** (people who think fuchsia is \"kinda pink\" only).\n3. **Found |A \u222a B|** (total believing in at least one color).\n4. **Applied the inclusion-exclusion principle** to solve for |B|.\n\nBy checking each step and reflecting on the approach, I ensured the solution is consistent and logical.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nThroughout the process, I started with brainstorming different strategies and chose the Venn diagram as the most intuitive. However, I remained flexible and ready to switch methods if needed. By continuously checking my work and reflecting on the calculations, I confirmed that the number of people believing fuchsia is \"purply\" is indeed **50**.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with natural checks and reflections, helped navigate the problem effectively, much like how a human would think through it.\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem by brainstorming different strategies and exploring each step naturally, just like I would if I were tackling it myself.

Maybe now I can find |B| by considering the total surveyed and those thinking neither.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Number of People in A \u222a B (Believing \"Kinda Pink\" or \"Purply\" or Both)**\n\nI know that:\n\n\\[\n|U| = |A \\cup B| + |Neither|\n\\]\n\\[\n|A \u222a B| = |U| - |Neither| = 100 - 17 = 83\n\\]\n\nSo, **83 people** believe fuchsia is either \"kinda pink,\" \"purply,\" or both.\n\nHmm, this step seems crucial because it gives me the total number in **A \u222a B**.
