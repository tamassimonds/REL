    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's see where this takes us!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, a few things stand out:\n\n1. **Shapes Involved:** We have a square and a circle.\n2. **Square Side Length:** The square has sides of length 10.\n3. **Circle's Center and Radius:** The circle is centered at one of the square's vertices with a radius of 10.\n4. **Objective:** Find the area of the union of the square and circle, expressed in terms of \u03c0.\n\nImmediately, I recall that this involves calculating the area covered by both shapes, accounting for their overlap. This situation reminds me of problems involving calculating areas of intersections and unions of geometric figures, similar to Venn diagrams but in two dimensions.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how to approach it just yet. Maybe I can explore a few strategies to see which one makes the most sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate the Area of Each Shape Separately:**\n   - Find the area of the square.\n   - Find the area of the circle.\n   \n2. **Determine the Overlapping Area:**\n   - Figure out how much of the square and circle overlap.\n   \n3. **Use the Union Formula:**\n   - Area of Union = Area of Square + Area of Circle - Area of Intersection\n   \n4. **Visualize the Problem:**\n   - Draw a diagram to understand the positions of the square and circle better.\n\n5. **Check Symmetry or Special Properties:**\n   - Maybe the circle only overlaps part of the square due to its radius.\n\nInitially, the formula for the area of the union seems like a solid starting point. But before jumping in, I think visualizing the problem might help clarify things.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Visualizing the Square and Circle**\n\nLet me try to create a mental (or even a rough sketch) of the square and circle:\n\n- **Square:**\n  - Has vertices at (0,0), (10,0), (10,10), and (0,10) in the Cartesian plane.\n\n- **Circle:**\n  - Centered at one vertex of the square, say (0,0).\n  - Radius extends to (10,0), (0,10), and (10,10).\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, so the circle's radius is 10, which means it extends from (0,0) all the way to (10,0), (0,10), and (10,10). This suggests that the circle covers more than just the square. In fact, it covers a quarter circle beyond the square's boundary.\n\n**Possible Insight:**\nHmm, that means a significant portion of the circle lies outside the square. So, the overlapping area might be more complicated than I initially thought.\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because the radius is equal to the square's side length, and the circle is centered at one of the square's vertices.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Areas**\n\nOkay, let's proceed with calculating the areas of both shapes.\n\n#### **2.1 Area of the Square (A\\_square)**\n\nThe formula for the area of a square is:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{square}} = \\text{side length}^2 = 10^2 = 100\n\\]\n\n#### **2.2 Area of the Circle (A\\_circle)**\n\nThe formula for the area of a circle is:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{circle}} = \\pi \\times \\text{radius}^2 = \\pi \\times 10^2 = 100\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, both areas are substantial. The square's area is straightforward, but the circle's area involves \u03c0. That's typical for circles since their area depends on \u03c0.\n\n**Check:**\nThese calculations seem correct. Squaring the side length and radius is the right approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Overlapping Area (A\\_overlap)**\n\nNow, to find the union's area, I need to determine how much of the square and circle overlap.\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\nThinking back, the overlapping area is likely shaped like a quarter circle since the circle is centered at a vertex of the square. The overlap would extend from the center (0,0) to the edges of the square.\n\nBut wait, is it a full quarter circle? Hmm, let me think\u2026 the circle covers a radius of 10, and the square extends to 10, so the overlapping region is indeed a quarter circle.\n\n**Possible Realization:**\nOh! So the overlapping area is exactly one-quarter of the circle's area.\n\n#### **3.1 Calculating the Overlapping Area (A\\_overlap)**\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{overlap}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times A_{\\text{circle}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100\\pi = 25\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThat makes sense. Since the circle is centered at a square vertex and covers a radius equal to the square's side, the overlap is a quarter of the circle.\n\n**Check:**\nWait, does this overlap with the square completely cover a quarter circle? Let me verify. Yes, because the circle extends to the square's edges, forming a quarter circle overlap.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Applying the Union Formula**\n\nNow, let's use the union formula to find the total area covered by both the square and circle:\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{union}} = A_{\\text{square}} + A_{\\text{circle}} - A_{\\text{overlap}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{union}} = 100 + 100\\pi - 25\\pi = 100 + 75\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Adding the square and circle's areas and subtracting the overlap gives the correct union area.\n\n**Check:**\nLet me double-check. The square's area is 100, the circle's area is 100\u03c0, and the overlap is 25\u03c0. Subtracting the overlap makes sense. The final area incorporates both shapes correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Approach**\n\nAt this point, I want to ensure that the approach is correct. Let's reflect:\n\n- **Is the overlapping area calculated accurately?**\n  - Yes, it's a quarter circle, and the calculation aligns.\n\n- **Does the union formula apply correctly here?**\n  - Absolutely, it's the standard way to find the area covered by both shapes.\n\n- **Have all components been accounted for?**\n  - Yes, the square's area, the circle's area, and their overlap are all included.\n\n**Natural Check:**\nThe final expression, \\(100 + 75\\pi\\), seems reasonable because it combines both areas while considering their overlap.\n\n**Random Insight:**\nWait a minute, is there a simpler way? Could I have avoided calculating the overlapping area separately? Let me think\u2026 No, given the specific setup, calculating the overlap was necessary to avoid double-counting.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully walking through each step and ensuring the calculations are correct, the area of the union of the regions enclosed by the square and circle is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{100 + 75\\pi}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nOverall, this approach worked well by:\n\n1. **Visualizing the Problem:** Understanding the shapes' positions helped clarify the overlapping region.\n2. **Calculating Areas Separately:** Finding each shape's area laid the groundwork for applying the union formula.\n3. **Determining the Overlapping Area:** Accurately calculating the overlap ensured no double-counting occurred.\n4. **Applying the Union Formula Correctly:** Combining the areas appropriately yielded the correct total.\n\nThroughout the process, checking each step and reflecting on the approach ensured the answer's accuracy. It also helped in identifying that the overlapping area was a quarter circle, which was pivotal in achieving the correct solution.\n\nBy exploring different strategies and verifying calculations, I was able to navigate through potential uncertainties and arrive at the final answer confidently.\n\n---\n\nThat wraps up the problem!
