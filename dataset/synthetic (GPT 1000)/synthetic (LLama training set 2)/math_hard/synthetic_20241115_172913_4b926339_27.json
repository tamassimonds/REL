    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm and explore different strategies, reflecting and checking my approach as I go, just like I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so we have a marching band with \\(20n\\) members, where \\(n\\) is an integer. When they line up in rows of 26, there are 4 members left over. Also, the total number of members is less than 1000. We need to find the maximum possible value of \\(20n\\).\n\nHmm, initially, I'm thinking this involves some kind of modular arithmetic since we're dealing with remainders. But let's brainstorm a bit to explore different strategies.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Modular Arithmetic:** Since there's a remainder when dividing by 26, maybe I can set up an equation involving \\(20n\\) modulo 26.\n   \n2. **Algebraic Equation:** Write an equation based on the information given and solve for \\(n\\).\n   \n3. **Trial and Error:** Since \\(n\\) is an integer and the total is less than 1000, perhaps I can test different values of \\(n\\) to see which works.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI'm leaning towards using modular arithmetic because it directly relates to the remainder information provided. But to ensure I cover all bases, I'll keep the other strategies in mind.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Modular Arithmetic**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIf \\(20n\\) members line up in rows of 26 with 4 members left over, it means:\n\n\\[\n20n \\equiv 4 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 26)\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that when \\(20n\\) is divided by 26, the remainder is 4. Let's see how we can work with this equation.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nFirst, let's simplify the congruence:\n\n\\[\n20n \\equiv 4 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 26)\n\\]\n\nTo simplify, we can divide both sides by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 26. Let's find the GCD:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCD}(20, 26) = 2\n\\]\n\nSo, divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\n10n \\equiv 2 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 13)\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, dividing by the GCD is valid only if both sides are divisible by it. Let\u2019s ensure that 4 is divisible by 2, which it is.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Simplified Congruence**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, I need to solve \\(10n \\equiv 2 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 13)\\). This reminds me of finding multiplicative inverses in modular arithmetic.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nTo isolate \\(n\\), I need to multiply both sides by the inverse of 10 modulo 13. But first, let's check if 10 has an inverse modulo 13 by verifying that \\(\\text{GCD}(10, 13) = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCD}(10, 13) = 1 \\quad (\\text{since 10 and 13 are coprime})\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, since they're coprime, an inverse exists. Now, let's find the inverse of 10 modulo 13.\n\n\\[\n10 \\times x \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 13)\n\\]\n\nCalculating multiples of 10 modulo 13:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 1 = 10 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 13) \\\\\n10 \\times 2 = 20 \\equiv 7 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 13) \\\\\n10 \\times 3 = 30 \\equiv 4 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 13) \\\\\n10 \\times 4 = 40 \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 13)\n\\]\n\nAh, so the inverse is 4.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 4 = 40 \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 13)\n\\]\n\nPerfect!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Multiplying Both Sides by the Inverse**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, multiply both sides of \\(10n \\equiv 2 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 13)\\) by 4:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 10n \\equiv 4 \\times 2 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 13)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n40n \\equiv 8 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 13)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBut wait, 40 modulo 13 is 1 (since \\(40 - 3 \\times 13 = 1\\)). So, the equation simplifies further:\n\n\\[\nn \\equiv 8 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 13)\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because multiplying 10n by 4 gives us an equivalent congruence, and simplifying 40 modulo 13 gives 1. So, \\(n \\equiv 8\\) modulo 13 is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: General Solution for n**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe congruence \\(n \\equiv 8 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 13)\\) tells us that \\(n\\) can take values like 8, 21, 34, etc. (i.e., 8 + multiples of 13). But we also have the constraint that the total number of members \\(20n < 1000\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet's express \\(n\\) in terms of \\(k\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer:\n\n\\[\nn = 8 + 13k\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute this into \\(20n\\):\n\n\\[\n20n = 20(8 + 13k) = 160 + 260k\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait, I need to ensure that \\(20n < 1000\\):\n\n\\[\n160 + 260k < 1000\n\\]\n\nSubtract 160 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n260k < 840\n\\]\n\nDivide by 260:\n\n\\[\nk < \\frac{840}{260} = 3.230769\n\\]\n\nSince \\(k\\) must be an integer, the maximum value of \\(k\\) is 3.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems logical. So, \\(k\\) can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating Possible Values of n**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, let's calculate the corresponding values of \\(n\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, 2, 3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nk = 0 & : n = 8 + 13 \\times 0 = 8 \\\\\nk = 1 & : n = 8 + 13 \\times 1 = 21 \\\\\nk = 2 & : n = 8 + 13 \\times 2 = 34 \\\\\nk = 3 & : n = 8 + 13 \\times 3 = 47 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet me double-check these calculations:\n\n- \\(8 + 0 \\times 13 = 8\\) \u2714\n- \\(8 + 1 \\times 13 = 21\\) \u2714\n- \\(8 + 2 \\times 13 = 34\\) \u2714\n- \\(8 + 3 \\times 13 = 47\\) \u2714\n\nThey all look correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Finding Corresponding Values of 20n**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWe need to find the maximum \\(20n\\) corresponding to these \\(n\\) values:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nn = 8 & : 20n = 160 \\\\\nn = 21 & : 20n = 420 \\\\\nn = 34 & : 20n = 680 \\\\\nn = 47 & : 20n = 940 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAll these values are less than 1000, so they satisfy the condition. Now, among these, the maximum \\(20n\\) is 940.\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet's verify if \\(20n = 940\\) satisfies the original remainder condition:\n\n\\[\n940 \\div 26 = 36 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\ 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n940 \\equiv 4 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 26)\n\\]\n\nThis matches the condition given in the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure that all steps align with the problem's requirements and that no constraints are overlooked.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Modular Arithmetic Setup:** Correctly provided \\(20n \\equiv 4 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 26)\\).\n- **Simplification:** Divided by the GCD to simplify the congruence.\n- **Solving for n:** Found \\(n \\equiv 8 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 13)\\).\n- **Integer Constraints:** Calculated possible integer values of \\(n\\) within the total member limit.\n- **Maximum Calculation:** Determined the maximum \\(20n = 940\\).\n- **Verification with Original Conditions:** Confirmed that \\(20n = 940\\) satisfies \\(20n \\mod 26 = 4\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The approach is consistent with the problem's requirements, and the calculations lead to a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough step-by-step exploration using modular arithmetic, simplification of congruences, and careful constraint management, I determined that the maximum number of people in the Trumpington marching band is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{940}\n\\]\n\nThis solution is validated by both the modular conditions and the integer constraints provided in the problem.",

  "ground_truth": "Since there are 4 band members left over when they line up in rows of 26, we have $20n \\equiv 4\\pmod{26}$. We divide both sides of the congruence by 4, remembering that we have to divide 26 by the greatest common divisor of 4 and 26. The original congruence is equivalent to \\[\n5n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]So we would like to find a multiple of 13 which is one less than a multiple of 5. Noticing that $13\\cdot 3$ has a units digit of 9, we identify $(13\\cdot 3 + 1)/5 =8$ as the inverse of 5 (mod 13). Multiplying both sides of our congruence by 8 gives \\[\nn \\equiv 8 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]We have found that $n$ satisfies the conditions given in the problem if $n=8+13k$ for some positive integer $k$ and $20n<1000$. Rewriting the inequality $20n<1000$ as $n<50$, we solve $8+13k < 50$ to find that the maximum solution is $k=\\lfloor 42/13\\rfloor = 3$. When $k=3$, the number of band members is $20(8+13(3))=\\boxed{940}$."
