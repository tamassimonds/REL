  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, emulating a natural problem-solving approach. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect along the way, and ensure the solution is coherent and complete, just like how I'd work through it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question asks for the area of a triangle formed by the **x** and **y** intercepts of the curve \n\n\\( y = (x-3)^2 (x+2) \\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving intercepts and areas under curves. I think finding the intercepts first would be a good starting point.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n\n  1. **Find the x and y intercepts:** Since intercepts are the points where the curve crosses the axes, these will be the vertices of the triangle.\n\n  2. **Use geometry to find the area:** Once I have the intercepts, I can use geometric formulas to calculate the area of the triangle.\n\n  3. **Alternative Methods:** Maybe use calculus if needed, but that seems overcomplicated for this type of problem.\n\n  \n- **Decision:** I\u2019ll start with the first strategy: **finding the intercepts**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding the X-Intercepts**\n\n- **Thought Process:** The x-intercepts occur where \n\n\\( y = 0 \\).\n\n So, I'll set the equation equal to zero and solve for \n\n\\( x \\).\n\n  \n\\[(x-3)^2 (x+2) = 0\\]\n  \n\n- **Solving the Equation:**\n\n  - **Brainstorm:** This is a product of factors, so the solution occurs where each factor is zero.\n\n  - **Set Each Factor to Zero:**\n\n    - \n\n\\((x-3)^2 = 0\\) \n\u21d2 \n\n\\(x = 3\\)\n    \n    - \n\n\\(x+2 = 0\\) \n\u21d2 \n\n\\(x = -2\\)\n  \n- **Reflection:** So, the x-intercepts are at \n\n\\(x = 3\\) \nand \n\n\\(x = -2\\).\n\n  \n  - **Check:** Plugging back into the original equation:\n\n    - For \n\n\\(x = 3\\)\n:\n\n      \n\\((3-3)^2 (3+2) = 0 \\times 5 = 0\\)\n\n \u2705\n\n    - For \n\n\\(x = -2\\)\n:\n\n      \n\\((-2-3)^2 (-2+2) = 25 \\times 0 = 0\\)\n\n \u2705\n  \n- **Conclusion:** The x-intercepts are \n\n\\((3, 0)\\) \nand \n\n\\((-2, 0)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Y-Intercept**\n\n- **Thought Process:** The y-intercept occurs where \n\n\\(x = 0\\).\n\n So, I'll plug \n\n\\(x = 0\\) \ninto the equation to find \n\n\\(y\\).\n\n  \n\\[\ny = (0-3)^2 (0+2) = 9 \\times 2 = 18\n\\]\n  \n\n- **Reflection:** The y-intercept is at \n\n\\((0, 18)\\).\n\n  \n  - **Check:** Plugging \n\n\\(x = 0\\) \nback:\n\n    \n\\(y = 9 \\times 2 = 18\\)\n\n \u2705\n  \n- **Conclusion:** The y-intercept is \n\n\\((0, 18)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying the Vertices of the Triangle**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Now that I have the intercepts, they form the vertices of the triangle:\n\n  - \n\n\\(A(3, 0)\\)\n  \n  - \n\n\\(B(-2, 0)\\)\n  \n  - \n\n\\(C(0, 18)\\)\n  \n- **Visualization:**\n\n  - **Brainstorm:** It\u2019s a right triangle with the base along the x-axis and the height along the y-axis.\n\n  - **Check:** The points lie on the axes, so it makes sense that it's a right triangle.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** The triangle is right-angled with the base from \n\n\\(x = -2\\) \nto \n\n\\(x = 3\\) \nand the height up to \n\n\\(y = 18\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Area of the Triangle**\n\n- **Thought Process:** For a right triangle, the area can be calculated using the formula:\n\n  \n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n  \n\n- **Determining the Base and Height:**\n\n  - **Base:** The distance between \n\n\\(x = -2\\) \nand \n\n\\(x = 3\\).\n\n    \n    - Calculation: \n\n\\(3 - (-2) = 5\\)\n  \n  - **Height:** The y-coordinate of the y-intercept, which is \n\n\\(18\\).\n\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n\n  - **Check:** The base is along the x-axis, and the height is along the y-axis, so these measurements are correct.\n  \n- **Calculating the Area:**\n\n  \n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 18 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 90 = 45 \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n  \n\n- **Reflection:**\n\n  - **Quick Check:** Half of 90 is 45, which seems reasonable given the dimensions.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** The area of the triangle is \n\n**45 square units**\n.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Double-Checking the Work**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Before finalizing, let's verify the calculations to ensure everything is correct.\n\n- **Checking the Intercepts:**\n\n  - **X-Intercepts:**\n\n    - \n\n\\((3, 0)\\) \nand \n\n\\((-2, 0)\\) \nboth satisfy \n\n\\(y = 0\\).\n\n  \n  - **Y-Intercept:**\n\n    - At \n\n\\((0, 18)\\),\n substituting back gives \n\n\\(y = 18\\).\n\n  \n- **Re-evaluating the Area Calculation:**\n\n  - **Base:** \n\n\\(5\\) \nunits\n  \n  - **Height:** \n\n\\(18\\) \nunits\n  \n  - **Area:** \n\n\\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 18 = 45\\) \nsquare units\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n\n  - **Consistency Check:** All calculations are consistent and correct.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** The solution is valid, and the area is indeed \n\n**45 square units**\n.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Strategy Success:** Finding the intercepts and using geometric properties worked well.\n\n- **No Need for Alternative Methods:** Since the first approach was straightforward and correct, there was no need to explore other methods like calculus.\n\n- **Verification:** Regular checks along the way helped ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Overall Reflection:** By systematically brainstorming, checking each step, and reflecting throughout the process, I confidently arrived at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER> \n\n**45 square units**\n\n. </ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nBy integrating brainstorming, reflection, and verification at each stage, the problem-solving process remains coherent and robust, leading to a reliable and complete solution.",
  "ground_truth": "First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5\\cdot 18=\\boxed{45}$."
