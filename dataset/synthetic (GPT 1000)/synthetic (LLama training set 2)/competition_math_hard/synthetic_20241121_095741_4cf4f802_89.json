  "problem": "Both roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 63 x + k = 0$ are prime numbers. How many possible values of $k$ are there?",
  "solution": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll walk through my thought process, checking for correctness along the way, and reflecting to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the question about a quadratic equation where both roots are prime numbers, a few strategies come to mind:\n\n- **Vieta's Formulas:** I recall that for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the sum and product of the roots are related to the coefficients.\n- **Prime Numbers:** Primes are numbers greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Only a few primes are relatively small, which might be useful.\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  - Use Vieta\u2019s formulas to express conditions on \\( k \\).\n  - List out prime numbers and see which pairs fit.\n  - Consider whether both roots being prime imposes specific constraints on \\( k \\).\n\n**Initial Strategy:** I think starting with Vieta\u2019s formulas could be a good approach since they directly relate the roots to the coefficients.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Vieta\u2019s Formulas**\n\nLet's apply Vieta\u2019s formulas to our quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 63x + k = 0 \\).\n\n- **Writing Down Vieta\u2019s:**\n  - Let the roots be \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n  - **Sum of Roots:**  \n    \\[ p + q = 63 \\]\n  - **Product of Roots:**  \n    \\[ p \\times q = k \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSince both \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are prime numbers adding up to 63, this gives us a direct equation to work with. I can look for prime pairs that satisfy this condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Listing Possible Prime Pairs**\n\nNow, I need to find all prime numbers \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) such that:\n\n\\[ p + q = 63 \\]  \n\\[ p \\leq q \\] (to avoid repeating pairs)\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nI know the smallest prime is 2, and except for 2, all primes are odd. So, I should start checking from there.\n\n**Possible Pairs:**  \nLet\u2019s list them out:\n\n| \\( p \\) | \\( q = 63 - p \\) | Is \\( q \\) Prime? |\n|---------|------------------|-------------------|\n| 2       | 61               | Yes               |\n| 3       | 60               | No                |\n| 5       | 58               | No                |\n| 7       | 56               | No                |\n| 11      | 52               | No                |\n| 13      | 50               | No                |\n| 17      | 46               | No                |\n| 19      | 44               | No                |\n| 23      | 40               | No                |\n| 29      | 34               | No                |\n| 31      | 32               | No                |\n| 37      | 26               | No                |\n| 41      | 22               | No                |\n| 43      | 20               | No                |\n| 47      | 16               | No                |\n| 53      | 10               | No                |\n| 59      | 4                | No                |\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLooking at the table, only \\( p = 2 \\) and \\( q = 61 \\) both are primes. All other combinations result in \\( q \\) being non-prime.\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me double-check if I missed any prime numbers or made an error in subtraction... Nope, it looks correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating \\( k \\)**\n\nWith the valid pair \\( (p, q) = (2, 61) \\), let\u2019s find \\( k \\).\n\n- **Using Vieta\u2019s Product:**  \n  \\[ k = p \\times q = 2 \\times 61 = 122 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, \\( k = 122 \\). But wait, is there only one possible value? Given that only one prime pair satisfies the sum of 63, it seems so.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, I want to ensure that no other prime pairs exist and that my approach is correct.\n\n- **Alternative Strategies Considered:**\n  - **Quadratic Formula:** Initially thought about using the quadratic formula to find roots, but since primes are specific numbers, listing them is more straightforward.\n  - **Graphical Approach:** Could graph the quadratic to see intercepts, but listing primes is simpler.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSince only \\( (2, 61) \\) works, \\( k = 122 \\) is the **only** possible value.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Solution**\n\n\\[ k = 122 \\]  \nThere is **only one** possible value of \\( k \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThis problem required identifying that both roots are prime and leveraging Vieta\u2019s formulas to find suitable prime pairs. By systematically checking all possible prime sums, we determined that only one pair fits, leading to a single value for \\( k \\).\n\nThroughout the process, reflecting on each step ensured accuracy and helped verify that no other solutions existed.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's how I arrived at the final answer: \\( k = 122 \\).",
  "ground_truth": "Let $p$ and $q$ be two primes that are roots of $x^2 - 63 x + k = 0$. Then $$\nx^2 - 63 x + k = (x - p)(x - q) = x^2 - (p+q)x + p \\cdot q,\n$$ so $p + q = 63$ and $p\\cdot q=k$. Since $63$ is odd, one of the primes must be $2$ and the other $61$. Thus, there is exactly $\\boxed{1}$ possible value for $k$, namely $k = p\\cdot q = 2\\cdot 61=122$."
