This suggests using the **sum of divisors formula**.\n  \n- **Exploring Strategies:**\n  - **Strategy 1:** Apply the sum of divisors formula.\n  - **Strategy 2:** List out divisors manually (likely inefficient).\n  - **Strategy 3:** Factorize 600 to find relationships (not directly helpful).\n\n- **Conclusion:** **<reflection>The sum of divisors formula seems the most promising approach.<reflection>**\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Strategy 1: Sum of Divisors Formula**\n\n#### **Step 1: Recall the Formula**\n\nFor a number \\( n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\ldots p_k^{a_k} \\), the sum of divisors is:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\ldots + p_1^{a_1})(1 + p_2 + \\ldots + p_2^{a_2}) \\ldots\n\\]\n\nFor \\( n = 2^i3^j \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(n) = (1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\ldots + 2^i)(1 + 3 + 3^2 + \\ldots + 3^j)\n\\]\n\n#### **Step 2: Simplify Using Geometric Series**\n\nBoth sums are geometric series:\n\n\\[\nS_2 = \\frac{2^{i+1} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{i+1} - 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS_3 = \\frac{3^{j+1} - 1}{3 - 1} = \\frac{3^{j+1} - 1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of divisors is:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma(n) = (2^{i+1} - 1) \\times \\frac{3^{j+1} - 1}{2} = 600\n\\]\n\n#### **Step 3: Set Up the Equation**\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n(2^{i+1} - 1)(3^{j+1} - 1) = 1200\n\\]\n\n<reflection>Does multiplying by 2 make sense here? Yes, it simplifies the equation, making it easier to handle.<reflection>\n\n---\n\n### **Developing Alternative Strategies: Assigning Values to Exponents**\n\n<reflection>Wait a minute\u2026 Actually, instead of guessing exponents, let's systematically factor 1200 to find suitable pairs for \\( 2^{i+1} - 1 \\) and \\( 3^{j+1} - 1 \\).<reflection>\n\n#### **Step 4: Factor 1200 into Possible Pairs**\n\nList out factor pairs of 1200:\n\n\\[\n(1, 1200), (2, 600), (3, 400), (4, 300), (5, 240), (6, 200), (8, 150), (10, 120), (12, 100), (15, 80), (16, 75), (20, 60), (24, 50), (25, 48), (30, 40)\n\\]\n\n#### **Step 5: Identify Suitable Factor Pair**\n\n**Testing Pair (15, 80):**\n\n- Assign:\n  \\[\n  2^{i+1} - 1 = 15 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 3^{j+1} - 1 = 80\n  \\]\n\n- Solving for \\( i \\) and \\( j \\):\n  \\[\n  2^{i+1} = 16 \\implies i+1 = 4 \\implies i = 3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  3^{j+1} = 81 \\implies j+1 = 4 \\implies j = 3\n  \\]\n\n#### **Step 6: Verify the Solution**\n\nCheck if the original equation holds:\n\n\\[\n(2^{4} - 1)(3^{4} - 1) = 15 \\times 80 = 1200\n\\]\n\n<verification>This pair works perfectly!<verification> So, \\( i = 3 \\) and \\( j = 3 \\), making \\( i + j = 6 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Checks and Conclusion**\n\n<final-confirmation>All calculations and checks confirm that the answer is correct.<final-confirmation>\n\n- **Sum of Divisors Formula:** Applied correctly.\n- **Equation Setup:** Simplified appropriately.\n- **Factor Pair Testing:** Identified and verified the correct pair.\n\n<ANSWER>\nAfter systematically applying the sum of divisors formula and testing factor pairs, we found that \\( i = 3 \\) and \\( j = 3 \\).

Systematically factoring 1200 and testing suitable pairs provided the clear path to the solution.\n  \n- **Reflection:** It's essential to remain flexible in problem-solving. If the first approach doesn't yield results, exploring alternative strategies can lead to success.\n\n---\n\n**And that's how we tackled this problem\u2014step by step, reflecting, and adjusting the approach as needed to arrive at the correct answer.**",
  "ground_truth": "The sum of the divisors of $2^i3^j$ is equal to $(1+2^1 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{i-1} + 2^i)(1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + \\cdots + 3^{j-1} + 3^j) = 600,$ since each factor of $2^i3^j$ is represented exactly once in the sum that results when the product is expanded. Let $A = 1+2^1 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{i}$ and $B = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + \\cdots + 3^{j}$, so that $A \\times B = 600$. The prime factorization of $600$ is $600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$.\n\nNotice that $A$ is the sum of $1$ and an even number and $B$ is the sum of $1$ and a number divisible by $3$. Thus, $A$ is odd and $B$ is not divisible by $3$. It follows that $A$ is divisible by $3$ and $B$ is divisible by $2^3$. We now have three separate cases: $(A,B) = (3 \\cdot 25,8), (3 \\cdot 5, 8 \\cdot 5), (3, 8 \\cdot 25)$.\n\nIn the first case, $B = 1 + 3 + \\cdots + 3^{j} = 8$; for $j = 1$, we have that $1 + 3 = 4 < 8$, and for $j = 2$, we have that $1 + 3 + 9 = 13 > 8$. Thus, this case is not possible.\n\nFor the third case, $B = 1 + 3 + \\cdots + 3^{j} = 200$; for $j = 4$, then $1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 < 200$, and for $j = 5$, we have that $1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 364 > 200$. Thus, this case is also not possible.\n\nIt follows that $(A,B) = (15, 40)$, in which case we find that $i = j = 3$ works. Thus, the answer is $3 + 3 = \\boxed{6}$."
