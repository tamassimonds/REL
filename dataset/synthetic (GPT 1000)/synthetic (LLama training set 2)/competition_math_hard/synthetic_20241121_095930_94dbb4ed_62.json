  "solution": "Absolutely, let's unify the thought process into a coherent, complete solution while maintaining the original reflections and strategies. This ensures clarity and correctness throughout the problem-solving journey.\n\n---\n\n## **[First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem]**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We're given a quadratic equation:  \n\\[  \n2x^2 + 6x - 14 = 0  \n\\]  \nwith solutions \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Our goal is to find the value of \\((2a - 3)(4b - 6)\\).\n\n### **Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Recognizing Quadratic Roots:**  \n  This reminds me of problems involving the roots of quadratic equations. I recall that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the solutions, so maybe I can use the quadratic formula to find them.\n\n- **Exploring Different Strategies:**  \n  - **Strategy 1:** Solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) using the quadratic formula, then plug them into \\((2a - 3)(4b - 6)\\).\n  - **Strategy 2:** Use Vieta's formulas to relate \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to the coefficients of the quadratic equation, potentially simplifying \\((2a - 3)(4b - 6)\\) without explicitly solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nI'm not entirely sure which strategy will be more efficient, but let's brainstorm and see where each path leads.\n\n---\n\n## **[Step 1: Solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) Using the Quadratic Formula]**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Quadratic Formula Reminder:**  \n  I know that for a quadratic equation:  \n  \\[  \n  ax^2 + bx + c = 0,  \n  \\]  \n  the solutions are given by:  \n  \\[  \n  x = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a}  \n  \\]\n\n- **Applying to Our Equation:**  \n  Here, \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 6\\), and \\(c = -14\\). Let's plug these values into the formula.\n\n### **Calculations:**\n\n\\[  \nx = \\frac{{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{{6^2 - 4 \\times 2 \\times (-14)}}}}{2 \\times 2}  \n\\]\n\n- **Simplify Inside the Square Root:**  \n  \\[  \n  6^2 = 36,\\quad 4 \\times 2 \\times (-14) = -112  \n  \\]  \n  \\[  \n  36 - (-112) = 36 + 112 = 148  \n  \\]\n\n- **Square Root of 148:**  \n  \\[  \n  \\sqrt{148} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 37} = 2\\sqrt{37}  \n  \\]\n\nWait a minute\u2014this seems like it might lead to messy calculations later. Maybe there's a better way...\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Is This the Best Approach?**  \n  Solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) explicitly might be straightforward, but dealing with square roots could complicate things when we plug them into \\((2a - 3)(4b - 6)\\).\n\n- **Alternative Strategy:**  \n  Perhaps using Vieta's formulas can simplify the problem by avoiding explicit solutions.\n\n---\n\n## **[Step 2: Using Vieta's Formulas]**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Recalling Vieta\u2019s Formulas:**  \n  For a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the sum and product of the roots are:  \n  \\[  \n  a + b = -\\frac{b}{a},\\quad ab = \\frac{c}{a}  \n  \\]\n\n- **Applying to Our Equation:**  \n  \\[  \n  a + b = -\\frac{6}{2} = -3,\\quad ab = \\frac{-14}{2} = -7  \n  \\]\n\nHmm, this gives us relationships between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that might be useful. Let's see how we can use these to find \\((2a - 3)(4b - 6)\\).\n\n### **Exploring Different Angles:**\n\n- **Expanding the Expression:**  \n  Maybe expanding \\((2a - 3)(4b - 6)\\) could help us express it in terms of \\(a + b\\) and \\(ab\\).\n\n---\n\n## **[Step 3: Expanding \\((2a - 3)(4b - 6)\\)]**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Distributing the Terms:**  \n  \\[  \n  (2a - 3)(4b - 6) = 2a \\times 4b + 2a \\times (-6) - 3 \\times 4b - 3 \\times (-6)  \n  \\]\n\n- **Simplifying:**  \n  \\[  \n  = 8ab - 12a - 12b + 18  \n  \\]\n\nOkay, now we've expanded the expression. Let's see if we can substitute the values from Vieta's formulas.\n\n### **Substitution Using Vieta\u2019s Formulas:**\n\n- **Given:**  \n  \\[  \n  a + b = -3,\\quad ab = -7  \n  \\]\n\n- **Substituting into the Expanded Expression:**  \n  \\[  \n  8ab - 12a - 12b + 18 = 8(-7) - 12a - 12b + 18  \n  \\]\n\n- **Calculating:**  \n  \\[  \n  8(-7) = -56,\\quad \\text{so,}\\quad -56 - 12a - 12b + 18  \n  \\]\n  \nWait, I still have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the expression. Let\u2019s see if I can substitute \\(a + b\\).\n\n### **Substituting \\(a + b = -3\\):**\n\n- **Rewriting:**  \n  \\[  \n  -12a - 12b = -12(a + b) = -12(-3) = 36  \n  \\]\n\n- **Final Expression:**  \n  \\[  \n  -56 + 36 + 18  \n  \\]\n\n- **Calculating:**  \n  \\[  \n  -56 + 36 = -20,\\quad -20 + 18 = -2  \n  \\]\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?**  \n  The calculations seem straightforward, and substituting Vieta's formulas simplified the expression nicely. I think we've arrived at the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n## **[Step 4: Verifying the Solution]**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Always Good to Double-Check:**  \n  Before finalizing, let's quickly check if everything aligns. Verifying each substitution and calculation can help catch any mistakes.\n\n- **Reviewing Each Step:**  \n  - **Vieta's Formulas Applied Correctly:**  \n    \\(a + b = -3\\), \\(ab = -7\\) \u2014 These are correct based on the given quadratic.\n  - **Expansion and Substitution:**  \n    The expanded expression was simplified correctly using the given sums and products.\n\n- **Final Check:**  \n  \\[  \n  -56 + 36 + 18 = -2  \n  \\]\n\nEverything checks out!\n\n---\n\n## **[Step 5: Conclusion]**\n\n### **Answer:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the calculations, the value of \\((2a - 3)(4b - 6)\\) is:  \n\\[  \n\\boxed{-2}  \n\\]\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Using Vieta's Formulas Simplified the Problem:**  \n  Instead of dealing with messy square roots, applying Vieta\u2019s relationships made the solution more straightforward.\n\n- **Reflection on Strategy Choice:**  \n  Initially, solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) seemed like a good idea, but recognizing that Vieta's formulas could simplify the process saved time and effort.\n\n- **Importance of Verification:**  \n  Double-checking each step ensured that the solution was correct, preventing any potential errors from slipping through.\n\nBut I realize that walking through different strategies and reflecting frequently helped me ensure the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>solution: -2</ANSWER>**\n\nIn summary, by starting with the quadratic formula, identifying potential complexities, and shifting to Vieta's formulas, we streamlined the problem-solving process. This approach not only simplified the calculations but also ensured accuracy through verification at each step.",
  "ground_truth": "Expanding the desired expression, we get $(2a-3)(4b-6)=8ab-12a-12b+18=8ab-12(a+b)+18$. This implies that we need the sum and product of the roots of the given equation, which are $-6/2=-3$ and $-14/2=-7$, respectively. Thus, the desired expression equals $(8\\cdot -7) - (12 \\cdot -3) + 18 = \\boxed{-2}$."
