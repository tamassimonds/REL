  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's put this together into a polished, coherent solution. Here's how I would approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have a right pyramid with an equilateral triangular base. The given information is:\n\n- **Area of One Lateral Face:** 75 square meters\n- **Slant Height:** 30 meters\n\nThe goal is to find the length of the side of the base.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- This involves geometry, specifically pyramids with triangular bases.\n- The lateral faces are congruent triangles since the base is equilateral.\n- Given the slant height and area of a lateral face, using the area formula for triangles seems promising.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Area Formula for Triangles:**\n   - The lateral face is a triangle.\n   - Formula:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n     \\]\n   - Here, the slant height serves as the height of the lateral face.\n\n2. **Consider Geometric Relationships:**\n   - Explore the connection between the slant height and the base in an equilateral triangle.\n\n3. **Apply Trigonometry:**\n   - Use trigonometric ratios since it's a right pyramid.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nUsing the area formula for triangles is straightforward and utilizes the given data directly. Let's proceed with this approach and see if it leads us to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Area Formula for Triangles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWe'll use the area formula to find the length of the base of the lateral face triangle.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n\n- Area = 75 m\u00b2\n- Height (slant height) = 30 m\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n75 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times 30\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n75 = 15 \\times \\text{base}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{base} = \\frac{75}{15} = 5 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\n**Checking This Approach:**\n\nWait a moment\u2014does this \"base\" correspond to the side of the equilateral triangular base of the pyramid?\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nActually, this base refers to the base of the lateral face triangle. In a right pyramid with an equilateral base, the base of the lateral face is equal to the side of the equilateral base. Therefore, this calculation directly gives us the desired side length.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Validating the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's ensure the solution makes sense:\n\n- The lateral face is an isosceles triangle with:\n  - **Base:** 5 meters (side of the equilateral base)\n  - **Height:** 30 meters (slant height)\n\n- Calculating the area to verify:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 30 = 75 \\text{ m}^2\n  \\]\n  Which matches the given area.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe calculations align perfectly with the provided data, confirming that the side length is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution</ANSWER>**\n\n<ANSWER>The length of the side of the base is 5 meters.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy straightforwardly applying the area formula for the lateral face and validating each step, we confidently arrive at the solution:\n\n- **The length of the side of the base is 5 meters.**\n\nThis method efficiently leverages the given information, ensuring accuracy through reflection and verification at each stage.

  "ground_truth": "Let $s$ represent the sidelength of the equilateral triangular base. Each face of the pyramid has an area of $\\frac{1}{2}bh=75$, where $b$ is the sidelength of the base and $h$ is the slant height of 30 meters. We have  $$75=\\frac{1}{2}s(30)=15s.$$So, $s=5$ and the sidelength of the base is $\\boxed{5}$ meters."
