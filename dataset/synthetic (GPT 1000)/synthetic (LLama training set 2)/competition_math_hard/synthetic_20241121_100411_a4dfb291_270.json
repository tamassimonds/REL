  "problem": "Let $f$ be a linear function for which $f(6)-f(2)=12$. What is $f(12)-f(2)?$",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking through it just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm, reflect, and check my work as I go to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question involves a linear function \\( f \\) where \\( f(6) - f(2) = 12 \\), and I need to find \\( f(12) - f(2) \\).\n\n#### **Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Linear Function:** I know that linear functions have a constant rate of change (slope). So, the difference in function values over an interval should relate to the slope.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Find the Slope:** Use the given information to determine the slope of the function.\n  2. **Express \\( f(x) \\) in Slope-Intercept Form:** Write \\( f(x) \\) as \\( mx + b \\) and see if I can find \\( m \\) and \\( b \\).\n  3. **Use Proportionality:** Since it's linear, differences over equal intervals should be proportional.\n\n- **Unsure Where to Start:** At first, I'm leaning towards finding the slope, but maybe proportionality would be quicker. Let's explore both to see which makes more sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Finding the Slope**\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Slope Definition:** For a linear function, the slope \\( m \\) is the change in \\( f(x) \\) over the change in \\( x \\). So, \\( m = \\frac{f(6) - f(2)}{6 - 2} \\).\n\n#### **Calculating the Slope:**\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{12}{4} = 3\n\\]\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Understanding the Slope:** Okay, the slope is 3. This means for every 1 unit increase in \\( x \\), \\( f(x) \\) increases by 3.\n\n- **Checking Work:** Wait a minute, let me double-check. \\( f(6) - f(2) = 12 \\) over an interval of 4 units (\\(6 - 2\\)), so \\( \\frac{12}{4} = 3 \\). Yep, that's correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Strategy 1: Using the Slope**\n\n#### **Next Step:**\n\n- **Understanding \\( f(12) - f(2) \\):** I need to find the change in \\( f(x) \\) from \\( x = 2 \\) to \\( x = 12 \\).\n\n- **Interval Length:** The interval from 2 to 12 is 10 units (\\(12 - 2 = 10\\)).\n\n#### **Using the Slope:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Change} = 3 \\times 10 = 30\n\\]\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Intuition Check:** This seems straightforward. If the slope is 3, extending over 10 units should indeed result in a change of 30.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does this make sense? Over 4 units, the change was 12. So, over 10 units (which is more than double), a change of 30 seems plausible.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Proportionality**\n\n#### **Thought Process:**\n\n- **Proportional Differences:** Since the function is linear, the differences should be proportional to the lengths of the intervals.\n\n#### **Setting Up Proportions:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f(6) - f(2)}{6 - 2} = \\frac{f(12) - f(2)}{12 - 2}\n\\]\n\n#### **Substituting Known Values:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12}{4} = \\frac{f(12) - f(2)}{10}\n\\]\n\n#### **Solving for \\( f(12) - f(2) \\):**\n\n\\[\n3 = \\frac{f(12) - f(2)}{10} \\implies f(12) - f(2) = 3 \\times 10 = 30\n\\]\n\n#### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Consistency Check:** Both strategies lead to the same result. This consistency checks out.\n\n- **Final Check:** Using two different approaches and arriving at the same answer reinforces its correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(<ANSWER>30</ANSWER>\\)\n\n**Solution:** The difference \\( f(12) - f(2) \\) is 30.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **Multiple Strategies:** Exploring both the slope method and proportionality helped confirm the correctness of the answer.\n\n- **Verification:** Checking calculations at each step ensured no errors were made.\n\n- **Reflecting on the Process:** Initially considering different strategies and validating them through cross-checks provided confidence in the final result.\n\n---\n\nBy thinking through the problem naturally\u2014starting with brainstorming, exploring multiple methods, checking work frequently, and reflecting at each stage\u2014I ensured that the solution was both correct and well-understood.",
  "ground_truth": "Since $f$ is a linear function, its slope is constant. Therefore\n\n\\[\\frac{f(6) - f(2)}{6-2} = \\frac{f(12) - f(2)}{12 - 2},\\]so \\[\\frac{12}{4} =\\frac{f(12) - f(2)}{10},\\]and $f(12) - f(2) = \\boxed{30}$."
