  "problem": "The measures of angles $A$ and $B$ are both positive, integer numbers of degrees. The measure of angle $A$ is a multiple of the measure of angle $B$, and angles $A$ and $B$ are complementary angles. How many measures are possible for angle $A$?",
  "solution": "Sure, let's put this all together into a polished, coherent solution step by step. I'll maintain the original approach while enhancing clarity and ensuring the thought process flows logically.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to determine how many possible measures exist for angle \\( A \\), given that:\n\n- \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are positive integers.\n- \\( A \\) is a multiple of \\( B \\) (\\( A = k \\times B \\) for some positive integer \\( k \\)).\n- \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are complementary angles (\\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\)).\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of problems involving complementary angles where their sum is \\( 90^\\circ \\). Since \\( A \\) is a multiple of \\( B \\), expressing \\( A \\) in terms of \\( B \\) seems like a viable approach. The goal is to explore how many integer solutions exist under these constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Equation Setup:** Perhaps I can set up an equation using the given conditions to find a relationship between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n- **Listing Multiples:** Alternatively, listing out possible multiples of \\( B \\) that sum to \\( 90^\\circ \\) could work.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure how to start. Should I set up an equation or maybe list out possible multiples? Let\u2019s explore different strategies to see which one fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Setting Up an Equation**\n\nLet's try expressing the relationship mathematically.\n\n1. **Multiple Relationship:**\n   \\[\n   A = k \\times B\n   \\]\n   where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\n2. **Complementary Angles:**\n   \\[\n   A + B = 90^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n**Substituting the First Equation into the Second:**\n\\[\nk \\times B + B = 90 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad B(k + 1) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( B \\):**\n\\[\nB = \\frac{90}{k + 1}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Okay, so \\( B \\) must be \\( 90 \\) divided by \\( k + 1 \\).\n- Since \\( B \\) is a positive integer, \\( k + 1 \\) must be a divisor of \\( 90 \\).\n\nThis seems like a good path. Now, I need to find all the divisors of \\( 90 \\) to determine possible values of \\( k \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Listing Divisors of 90**\n\nLet\u2019s list all the divisors of \\( 90 \\) to find possible \\( k + 1 \\) values.\n\n**Divisors of 90:**\n\\[\n1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90\n\\]\n\n**Corresponding \\( k \\) Values:**\n\\[\nk + 1 = \\text{divisor} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k = \\text{divisor} - 1\n\\]\n\\[\nk = 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 14, 17, 29, 44, 89\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\n\n- \\( k = 0 \\) would mean \\( A = 0 \\), which isn't allowed since \\( A \\) must be a positive angle.\n\n**Revising the List:**\n\n- So, I should exclude \\( k = 0 \\).\n\n**Final \\( k \\) Values:**\n\\[\nk = 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 14, 17, 29, 44, 89\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Calculating Corresponding \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**\n\nLet\u2019s compute \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) for each valid \\( k \\).\n\n**For Each \\( k \\):**\n\\[\nB = \\frac{90}{k + 1}\n\\]\n\\[\nA = k \\times B = k \\times \\frac{90}{k + 1} = \\frac{90k}{k + 1}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n| \\( k \\) | \\( k + 1 \\) | \\( B = \\frac{90}{k+1} \\) | \\( A = \\frac{90k}{k+1} \\) |\n|---------|------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 1       | 2          | 45                      | 45                       |\n| 2       | 3          | 30                      | 60                       |\n| 4       | 5          | 18                      | 72                       |\n| 5       | 6          | 15                      | 75                       |\n| 8       | 9          | 10                      | 80                       |\n| 9       | 10         | 9                       | 81                       |\n| 14      | 15         | 6                       | 84                       |\n| 17      | 18         | 5                       | 85                       |\n| 29      | 30         | 3                       | 87                       |\n| 44      | 45         | 2                       | 88                       |\n| 89      | 90         | 1                       | 89                       |\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection: Does This Make Sense?**\n\n- **Complementary Condition:** Each pair \\( (A, B) \\) adds up to \\( 90^\\circ \\), which satisfies the complementary condition.\n- **Multiples Condition:** \\( A \\) is indeed a multiple of \\( B \\) in each case.\n- **Positive Integers:** All angles \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are positive integers.\n\nThis approach seems correct. However, let\u2019s do a quick check to ensure everything aligns.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- Do all \\( A + B = 90^\\circ \\)? **Yes.**\n- Is \\( A \\) a multiple of \\( B \\) in each case? **Yes.**\n\n**Deeper Reflection:**\n\n- **Complete List:** Have I considered all possible \\( k \\) values? Yes, except \\( k = 0 \\) which is invalid.\n- **Constraints:** Are there any other constraints I might have missed? No, the problem only specifies these conditions.\n\nEverything looks good so far. Now, let's proceed to finalize the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the problem and verifying each step, we conclude that there are 11 possible measures for angle \\( A \\):\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{45^\\circ, 60^\\circ, 72^\\circ, 75^\\circ, 80^\\circ, 81^\\circ, 84^\\circ, 85^\\circ, 87^\\circ, 88^\\circ, 89^\\circ}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Conclusion**\n\nBy setting up the relationship between angles \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) using multiples and the complementary condition, I derived a straightforward equation:\n\n\\[\nB = \\frac{90}{k + 1}\n\\]\n\nFrom there, determining that \\( k + 1 \\) must be a divisor of \\( 90 \\) allowed me to list all possible integer solutions for \\( B \\), which in turn provided the corresponding measures for \\( A \\).\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- All conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n- The solution method is clear and logical.\n- Each step has been verified for correctness.\n\nThis step-by-step approach ensured that all possible cases were considered and that the correctness of each step was confirmed, leading to a reliable and accurate solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Visualizing with Angles**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- Perhaps visualizing the problem by thinking about how angles \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) fit together could provide additional insights.\n- Considering that \\( A \\) is a multiple of \\( B \\), maybe drawing or imagining different scenarios could help verify the solution.\n\n**Exploring Alternative Strategy:**\n\n1. **Visual Representation:**\n\n   - Imagine a right triangle where angles \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are the non-right angles.\n   - Since \\( A \\) is a multiple of \\( B \\), angle \\( A \\) could be seen as composed of several \\( B \\)'s.\n\n2. **Checking Specific Cases:**\n\n   - For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( A = B = 45^\\circ \\). This forms an isosceles right triangle.\n   - For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( A = 60^\\circ \\) and \\( B = 30^\\circ \\). This forms a classic 30-60-90 triangle.\n\n3. **Reflection:**\n\n   - These visual scenarios align with well-known angle measures in right triangles, reinforcing the validity of the solution.\n   - By considering familiar geometric configurations, the solution's correctness is further validated.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\n- Utilizing visual and geometric reasoning alongside algebraic methods provides a robust check, ensuring the solution is both logically and intuitively sound.\n\n---\n\nThis alternative approach reinforces the validity of the original solution, adding an extra layer of verification through geometric visualization.",
  "ground_truth": "The given information tells us that $A = 90^\\circ -B$ and $A=kB$ for some $k\\ge1$.  Therefore, we have $kB = 90^\\circ - B$. This simplifies to $(k+1)B=90^\\circ$. $k+1$ can be any factor of $90$ except one, since $k+1\\ge2$. $90=2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5$ has $2\\cdot3\\cdot2=12$ factors, so there are 11 possible values of $k$. Each value of $k$ uniquely determines the value of $B$ and therefore the value of $A$, so there are $\\boxed{11}$ possible measures for $A$."
