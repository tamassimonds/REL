  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into this problem. I see where I might have gone astray initially, so I'll walk through my original thought process, identify the missteps, and adjust my approach accordingly\u2014just like naturally working through a challenging question.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, we're dealing with a sequence of 58 terms, each of the form \\( P + n \\), where:\n- \\( P \\) is the product of all prime numbers less than or equal to 61.\n- \\( n \\) takes values from 2 to 59.\n\nThe goal is to find how many of these terms are prime, denoted as \\( N \\).\n\n<Reflection: \u201cThis reminds me of problems involving prime numbers and modular arithmetic. Maybe leveraging the properties of \\( P \\) being a product of primes will help. Let\u2019s brainstorm some strategies.\u201d>\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Modular Arithmetic:**  \n   Since \\( P \\) is divisible by all primes up to 61, perhaps \\( P + n \\) has specific divisibility properties that could indicate whether it's prime.\n\n2. **Primality Testing:**  \n   Individually checking each \\( P + n \\) to see if it's prime. But given that \\( P \\) is enormous, this might be impractical.\n\n3. **Analyzing \\( n \\):**  \n   Examining whether \\( n \\) shares factors with \\( P \\) could determine the compositeness of \\( P + n \\).\n\n<Reflection: \u201cLet\u2019s start with modular arithmetic since \\( P \\) is a product of primes. If that doesn\u2019t work, we can explore other options.\u201d>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Modular Arithmetic**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf \\( P \\) is the product of all primes up to 61, then \\( P \\) is divisible by each of those primes. So, \\( P + n \\) might exhibit interesting properties mod these primes.\n\n<Reflection: \u201cThis seems promising. Let\u2019s proceed with calculating \\( P + n \\mod p \\) for each prime \\( p \\leq 61 \\).\u201d>\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nFor any prime \\( p \\leq 61 \\):\n\\[\nP \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\quad \\text{(since \\( P \\) is divisible by \\( p \\))}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow P + n \\equiv n \\pmod{p}\n\\]\n\n<Reflection: \u201cSo, \\( P + n \\) is congruent to \\( n \\) modulo \\( p \\). This means if \\( n \\) is divisible by any prime \\( p \\leq 61 \\), then \\( P + n \\) is composite. But what if \\( n \\) isn\u2019t divisible by these primes?\u201d>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying Composite Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet\u2019s identify all \\( n \\) values that are divisible by any prime \\( p \\leq 61 \\). For these \\( n \\), \\( P + n \\) will be composite.\n\n<Reflection: \u201cWait a minute, \\( n \\) ranges from 2 to 59, and all these numbers are either primes themselves or multiples of smaller primes. Let\u2019s list them out to see which \\( P + n \\) are definitely composite.\u201d>\n\n**Listing \\( n \\) Divisible by Primes \u2264 61:**\n\n- **Multiples of 2:**  \n  \\( n = 2, 4, 6, \\ldots, 58 \\) (29 terms)\n\n- **Multiples of 3:**  \n  \\( n = 3, 6, 9, \\ldots, 57 \\) (19 terms)\n\n<Reflection: \u201cBut hold on, some multiples of 3 are also multiples of 2 (like 6, 12, 18, etc.). I need to account for overlap to avoid double-counting. Let\u2019s use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.\u201d>\n\n**Applying Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**\n\nTotal multiples of 2 and 3 (i.e., multiples of 6):\n\\[\nn = 6, 12, 18, \\ldots, 54 \\quad (9 \\text{ terms})\n\\]\nSo, the number of unique \\( n \\) divisible by 2 or 3 is:\n\\[\n29 \\, (2 \\text{ multiples}) + 19 \\, (3 \\text{ multiples}) - 9 \\, (6 \\text{ multiples}) = 39\n\\]\n\n<Reflection: \u201cOkay, that accounts for 39 composite terms. But what about \\( n \\) divisible by larger primes like 5, 7, etc.? I need to consider those too.\u201d>\n\n**Checking Higher Primes (\\( p \\geq 5 \\)):**\n\n- **Prime 5:**  \n  \\( n = 5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 55 \\)  \n  Many of these are already multiples of 2 or 3, but let\u2019s list unique ones:\n  - \\( n = 5, 25, 35, 55 \\) (4 unique terms)\n\n- **Prime 7:**  \n  \\( n = 7, 14, 21, \\ldots, 56 \\)  \n  Again, many are multiples of 2 or 3, but unique ones:\n  - \\( n = 7, 49 \\) (2 unique terms)\n\n<Reflection: \u201cIt seems like for higher primes, only a few \\( n \\) remain that aren\u2019t already accounted for. Let\u2019s keep listing until we cover all primes up to 59.\u201d>\n\n**Continuing with Higher Primes:**\n\n- **Prime 11:**  \n  \\( n = 11, 22, 33, 44, 55 \\)  \n  Except for \\( n = 11 \\), all are multiples of smaller primes.\n\n- **Prime 13:**  \n  \\( n = 13, 26, 39, 52 \\)  \n  Except for \\( n = 13 \\), others are multiples of smaller primes.\n\n<Reflection: \u201cWait, I think I see where I went wrong initially. I might have missed accounting for all composites properly, which led me to an incorrect conclusion. Let me double-check my reasoning here.\u201d>\n\n<Correction: \u201cActually, looking at this again, I realize that I need to ensure all \\( n \\) that are multiples of any prime up to 59 are marked as composite. Let\u2019s make sure we don\u2019t miss any.\u201d>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finalizing the List of Composite \\( n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo avoid missing any composite \\( n \\), let\u2019s systematically list all \\( n \\) that are divisible by any prime up to 59. This ensures that \\( P + n \\) is composite for those cases.\n\n<Reflection: \u201cHmm, let me double-check my list to ensure completeness. It\u2019s better to be thorough than to overlook something important.\u201d>\n\n**Re-examining Composite \\( n \\):**\n\nAfter carefully listing all \\( n \\) divisible by any prime up to 59, we have:\n\\[\nn = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58\n\\]\n\nThis accounts for 45 composite \\( n \\).\n\n<Reflection: \u201cWait, that leaves 13 potential primes out of 58 terms, but the answer choices don\u2019t include 13. Hmm, I must be missing something. Let\u2019s think about this differently.\u201d>\n\n<Correction: \u201cActually, I realize that \\( P + n \\) could still be composite even if \\( n \\) isn\u2019t divisible by primes up to 61. Maybe I need to reconsider my approach.\u201d>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nPerhaps there\u2019s a more straightforward way to determine that \\( P + n \\) is always composite for the given \\( n \\). Let\u2019s consider the properties of \\( P \\) and \\( n \\) more deeply.\n\n<Reflection: \u201cWait a minute, I think I see where I went wrong. I focused only on \\( n \\) divisible by primes up to 61, but maybe there\u2019s more to it. Let me explore another angle.\u201d>\n\n**New Strategy:**  \nSince \\( n \\) ranges from 2 to 59, and \\( P \\) is the product of all primes up to 61, \\( n \\) must have prime factors that are \u2264 59. Therefore, \\( n \\) and \\( P \\) share at least one common factor other than 1, making \\( P + n \\) composite.\n\n<Reflection: \u201cOh! This reminds me of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic\u2014if \\( n \\) shares a prime factor with \\( P \\), then \\( P + n \\) is composite. This simplifies things significantly.\u201d>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Concluding That All \\( P + n \\) Are Composite**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nGiven that each \\( n \\) from 2 to 59 has prime factors \u2264 59, and \\( P \\) is the product of all primes up to 61, there\u2019s always a common factor between \\( P \\) and \\( n \\). Thus, \\( P + n \\) is never prime.\n\n<Reflection: \u201cHmm, that makes sense. Since \\( n \\) and \\( P \\) share common factors, \\( P + n \\) must be composite. This aligns with the problem's structure.\u201d>\n\n**Final Check:**  \nAll \\( P + n \\) terms are composite because:\n- \\( n \\) has prime factors \u2264 59.\n- \\( P \\) includes all primes up to 61.\n- Therefore, \\( P \\) and \\( n \\) share at least one common factor, making \\( P + n \\) composite.\n\n<Reflection: \u201cThat\u2019s clear now. Initially, I overlooked the fact that all \\( n \\) have factors within \\( P \\). By correcting this, I see that \\( N = 0 \\).\u201d>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>0</ANSWER>\n\n**Explanation:**  \nAll \\( P + n \\) terms in the sequence are composite because \\( n \\) and \\( P \\) share at least one common prime factor. Therefore, there are no prime numbers in the sequence, making \\( N = 0 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Adjustments**\n\n- **Initial Misstep:**  \n  I originally considered only \\( n \\) divisible by primes up to 61 but didn\u2019t account for all possible factors shared between \\( P \\) and \\( n \\).\n\n- **Realization:**  \n  By recognizing that \\( n \\) has prime factors \u2264 59, and \\( P \\) includes all primes up to 61, I understood that \\( P \\) and \\( n \\) always share common factors, rendering \\( P + n \\) composite.\n\n- **Final Conclusion:**  \n  All terms \\( P + n \\) are composite, leading to \\( N = 0 \\).\n\n<Reflection: \u201cI see now that a more holistic view of the factors involved was necessary. By correcting my initial approach, I arrived at the correct answer.\u201d>\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n<ANSWER>0</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "First, note that $n$ does not have a prime number larger than $61$ as one of its factors. Also, note that $n$ does not equal $1$.\nTherefore, since the prime factorization of $n$ only has primes from $2$ to $59$, $n$ and $P$ share at least one common factor other than $1$. Therefore $P+n$ is not prime for any $n$, so the answer is $\\boxed{}$."
