We'll brainstorm, reflect, and check our work just like a human would when solving a tricky math problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two expressions involving \\( a \\), where \\( a \\) is an odd multiple of 7767. Immediately, I'm thinking about Euclidean algorithms and properties of GCDs, especially since both expressions depend on \\( a \\). But before diving in, let's brainstorm possible approaches:\n\n1. **Euclidean Algorithm:** Use the GCD of two numbers approach by expressing one in terms of the other.\n2. **Polynomial GCD:** Treat the expressions as polynomials in \\( a \\) and find their GCD.\n3. **Evaluate at Specific Values:** Plug in a specific multiple of 7767 to see if patterns emerge.\n4. **Factoring:** Attempt to factor one or both expressions to simplify the GCD computation.\n\nI'm inclined to start with the **Euclidean Algorithm** because it's a robust method for finding GCDs, especially when dealing with linear expressions.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Euclidean Algorithm**\n\n**Step 1: Setting Up the Euclidean Algorithm**\n\nRecall that for any two integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), \\(\\gcd(m, n) = \\gcd(n, m \\mod n)\\). So, let's set:\n\n\\[\nf(a) = 6a^2 + 49a + 108 \n\\]\n\\[\ng(a) = 2a + 9 \n\\]\n\nWe want to find \\(\\gcd(f(a), g(a))\\). According to the Euclidean algorithm, we should compute \\( f(a) \\mod g(a) \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To compute \\( f(a) \\mod g(a) \\), I need to express \\( f(a) \\) in terms of \\( g(a) \\).\n- This involves polynomial division, where I divide \\( f(a) \\) by \\( g(a) \\) and look for the remainder.\n- If the remainder is zero, \\( g(a) \\) divides \\( f(a) \\) perfectly; otherwise, the GCD will involve the remainder.\n\n**Step 2: Performing Polynomial Division**\n\nLet's divide \\( f(a) \\) by \\( g(a) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Divide } 6a^2 \\text{ by } 2a: \\quad \\frac{6a^2}{2a} = 3a\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Multiply } 3a \\text{ by } g(a): \\quad 3a(2a + 9) = 6a^2 + 27a\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Subtract from } f(a): \\quad (6a^2 + 49a + 108) - (6a^2 + 27a) = 22a + 108\n\\]\n\nSo, the remainder after the first division step is \\( 22a + 108 \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Does this make sense? Yes, because \\( 6a^2 \\) terms cancel out, and we're left with a linear expression.\n- The degree of the remainder (\\( 22a + 108 \\)) is less than the degree of \\( g(a) \\), which is what we expect.\n\n**Step 3: Applying the Euclidean Algorithm Again**\n\nNow, compute the GCD of \\( g(a) = 2a + 9 \\) and the remainder \\( r(a) = 22a + 108 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(2a + 9, 22a + 108) = \\gcd(2a + 9, (22a + 108) \\mod (2a + 9))\n\\]\n\nWe need to perform another polynomial division:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Divide } 22a \\text{ by } 2a: \\quad \\frac{22a}{2a} = 11\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Multiply } 11 \\text{ by } g(a): \\quad 11(2a + 9) = 22a + 99\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Subtract from } r(a): \\quad (22a + 108) - (22a + 99) = 9\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- The remainder is now 9, a constant.\n- This is significant because once the remainder becomes a constant, it indicates the GCD is a constant factor.\n\n**Step 4: Final GCD Computation**\n\nNow, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(2a + 9, 9) = \\gcd(2a + 9, 9)\n\\]\n\nSince 9 is a constant, the GCD depends on whether \\( 2a + 9 \\) is divisible by 9.\n\n**But wait!** \\( a \\) is an odd multiple of 7767. Let's explore this further.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflecting on the Approach**\n\nAt this point, I realize that knowing \\( a \\) is an odd multiple of 7767 might help simplify the problem. Maybe we can find how \\( 2a + 9 \\) relates to 9, given \\( a \\)'s properties.\n\n**New Idea:**\n\n- **Evaluate \\( 2a + 9 \\mod 9 \\):** If \\( 2a + 9 \\) is divisible by 9, then the GCD will be 9; otherwise, it will be smaller.\n- Since \\( a \\) is a multiple of 7767, perhaps we can express \\( 2a + 9 \\) in terms of 7767 and see how it modulates with 9.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring \\( 2a + 9 \\mod 9 \\)**\n\n**Step 1: Express \\( a \\) in Terms of 7767**\n\nLet\u2019s set \\( a = 7767k \\), where \\( k \\) is an odd integer (since \\( a \\) is an odd multiple).\n\n**Step 2: Substitute into \\( 2a + 9 \\)**\n\n\\[\n2a + 9 = 2(7767k) + 9 = 15534k + 9\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify \\( 15534k + 9 \\mod 9 \\)**\n\n- First, notice that \\( 15534 \\) is a multiple of 9 (since \\( 1 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 18 \\), and 18 is divisible by 9).\n- Therefore, \\( 15534k \\mod 9 = 0 \\).\n- Thus, \\( 15534k + 9 \\mod 9 = 9 \\mod 9 = 0 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- \\( 2a + 9 \\) is divisible by 9 regardless of the value of \\( k \\).\n- This implies that the GCD is at least 9.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thougts**\n\nAfter revisiting the approach and considering the properties of \\( a \\), it's clear that:\n\n- **\\( 2a + 9 \\) is always divisible by 9.**\n- **The remainder when \\( 22a + 108 \\) is divided by \\( 2a + 9 \\) is 9.**\n- **Therefore, the GCD is 9.**\n\nThis matches our earlier computation using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe greatest common divisor of \\( 6a^2 + 49a + 108 \\) and \\( 2a + 9 \\) is **9**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Initial Approach:** Started with the Euclidean algorithm, which worked smoothly.\n- **Mid-Problem Realization:** Recognized that understanding \\( a \\)'s properties could simplify the problem, leading to confirming that \\( 2a + 9 \\) is divisible by 9.\n- **Verification:** Both the Euclidean algorithm and modular arithmetic agree on the GCD being 9.\n- **Confidence in Solution:** High, as multiple methods lead to the same answer.\n\nBy allowing the thought process to evolve naturally, checking each step, and being open to adjusting strategies, we've confidently arrived at the correct solution.",
