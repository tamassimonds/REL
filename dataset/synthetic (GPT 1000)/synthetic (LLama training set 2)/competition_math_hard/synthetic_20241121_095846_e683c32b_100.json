  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into this problem and refine our approach to present a polished, coherent solution. I'll maintain the original thought process, making sure to reflect and verify at each step to ensure correctness. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have two positive integers, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), with:\n\\[ a + b = 24 \\]\nand another equation:\n\\[ 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \\]\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nThis looks like a system of equations involving two variables. The sum of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is given, which suggests that substitution might be a helpful strategy. However, before committing, let's brainstorm multiple approaches to see which one fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Substitution Method:**  \n   Use the first equation to express one variable in terms of the other and substitute into the second equation.\n\n2. **Elimination Method:**  \n   Manipulate the equations to eliminate one variable.\n\n3. **Factoring:**  \n   Attempt to factor the second equation to simplify the problem.\n\n4. **Graphical Approach:**  \n   Visualize the equations' intersection points, though not practical here.\n\n**Decision:**  \nSubstitution seems straightforward and efficient, so let's start there. If it becomes complicated, we'll consider other methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Substitution Method**\n\nFrom \\( a + b = 24 \\), express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n\\[ b = 24 - a \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis substitution reduces the number of variables in the second equation, making it easier to solve. Let's proceed by substituting \\( b \\) into the second equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting \\( b = 24 - a \\) into the Second Equation**\n\nReplace \\( b \\) in \\( 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \\):\n\\[ 2a(24 - a) + 10a = 3(24 - a) + 222 \\]\n\n**Checking Work:**  \nSubstitution looks correct. Now, let's expand and simplify both sides.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Expanding and Simplifying the Equation**\n\n**Left Side:**\n\\[ 2a(24 - a) = 48a - 2a^2 \\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ 48a - 2a^2 + 10a = 3(24 - a) + 222 \\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ 58a - 2a^2 = 72 - 3a + 222 \\]\n\n**Right Side:**\n\\[ 72 - 3a + 222 = 294 - 3a \\]\n\n**Bringing It Together:**\n\\[ 58a - 2a^2 = 294 - 3a \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis is forming a quadratic equation. Let's rearrange it to set the equation to zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Rearranging to Form a Quadratic Equation**\n\nMove all terms to one side:\n\\[ -2a^2 + 58a + 3a - 294 = 0 \\]\nSimplify:\n\\[ -2a^2 + 61a - 294 = 0 \\]\n\n**Checking Coefficients:**  \n- Combine \\( 58a + 3a = 61a \\)\n- Constant term is \\( -294 \\)\n\nEverything checks out. To make the equation cleaner, let's multiply the entire equation by \\(-1\\):\n\\[ 2a^2 - 61a + 294 = 0 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow we have a standard quadratic equation. Factoring might be challenging, so the quadratic formula is a reliable choice.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Applying the Quadratic Formula**\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\\[ a = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a} \\]\nFor our equation \\( 2a^2 - 61a + 294 = 0 \\):\n- \\( a = 2 \\)\n- \\( b = -61 \\)\n- \\( c = 294 \\)\n\nPlugging these values in:\n\\[ a = \\frac{{61 \\pm \\sqrt{{(-61)^2 - 4 \\times 2 \\times 294}}}}{4} \\]\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = 3721 - 2352 = 1369 \\]\n\\[ \\sqrt{1369} = 37 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe discriminant is a perfect square, which means we'll obtain integer solutions\u2014consistent with \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) being positive integers.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Solving for \\( a \\)**\n\nPlug the square root back into the formula:\n\\[ a = \\frac{{61 \\pm 37}}{4} \\]\n\nThis yields two potential solutions:\n\\[ a = \\frac{{61 + 37}}{4} = \\frac{98}{4} = 24.5 \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{{61 - 37}}{4} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSince \\( a \\) must be a positive integer, \\( a = 24.5 \\) is not valid. Therefore, the only acceptable solution is \\( a = 6 \\).\n\n**Checking Validity:**  \n- If \\( a = 6 \\), then \\( b = 24 - 6 = 18 \\)\n- Both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, and their sum is 24. This aligns perfectly with the given conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Verifying the Solution in the Original Equation**\n\nIt's crucial to verify that these values satisfy the second equation:\n\\[ 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \\]\n\nPlugging \\( a = 6 \\) and \\( b = 18 \\):\n\\[ 2(6)(18) + 10(6) = 3(18) + 222 \\]\n\\[ 216 + 60 = 54 + 222 \\]\n\\[ 276 = 276 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe equation holds true, confirming that our solution is correct. Verification is an essential step to ensure no mistakes were made during the solving process.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and applying the substitution method, we solved the resulting quadratic equation to find that:\n\\(<ANSWER> ab = 6 \\times 18 = 108 \\)\n\nsolution  \\)</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Brainstorming Helped:** Initially considering multiple methods ensured that I chose an efficient path. Being open to switching strategies saved time.\n\n- **Verification is Key:** Checking the solution in the original equation confirmed its correctness, preventing potential errors from going unnoticed.\n\n- **Flexibility in Approach:** Being willing to abandon factoring in favor of the quadratic formula expedited the solution process when factoring wasn't straightforward.\n\nBy reflecting and verifying at each step, I ensured the solution was accurate and consistent with the given conditions.\n\n---\n\nThere you have it! By carefully walking through each step, checking our work, and verifying the solution, we've confidently arrived at the correct answer.",
  "ground_truth": "We begin by rewriting the equation as $2ab + 10a - 3b = 222$. We can then use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation to get $2ab + 10a - 3b - 15 = 207$. This can be factored into $$(2a - 3)(b + 5) = 207$$We know that the prime factorization of $207 = 3^2 \\cdot 23$ and that both $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, so the only possible solutions $(a,b)$ are $$(a,b) = \\{(13,4),(6,18),(2,202),(3,64)\\}$$Out of these, only $(6,18)$ meets the requirement that $a+b=24$. Thus, $ab = \\boxed{108}$."
