  "solution": "---\n\n# **Finding the Smallest Integer with Undefined Modular Inverses**\n\n## **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nAlright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. **First impressions:** This looks like a question about modular inverses and when they are undefined. I recall that modular inverses are tied to coprimality\u2014an inverse exists if and only if the number and the modulus are coprime. But honestly, it's been a while since I tackled something like this, so I want to double-check my understanding.\n\n### **Initial Ideas:**\n- **Explore the concept of modular inverses:** Maybe recall how inverses work modulo a number.\n- **Consider the properties of numbers 55 and 66:** Perhaps their prime factors play a role.\n- **Look for the smallest integer \\( a \\) that lacks inverses for both moduli:** This seems straightforward, but I need to ensure there's no overlap or hidden complexity.\n\nI think I'll **start by reflecting** on what it means for \\( a^{-1} \\) to be undefined modulo 55 and 66. If that doesn't lead anywhere, I might need to rethink my approach.\n\n---\n\n## **Understanding Modular Inverses: Exploring Definitions**\n\n**Thought Process:** To have \\( a^{-1} \\) undefined modulo a number, \\( a \\) must **not** be coprime with that modulus. In other words, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a \\) and the modulus must be greater than 1. \n\n**Reflection:** Wait a minute, this makes sense. If \\( \\gcd(a, \\text{modulus}) > 1 \\), then \\( a \\) shares a factor with the modulus, preventing the existence of an inverse. So, for both \\( a^{-1} \\) to be undefined modulo 55 and 66, \\( a \\) must share factors with **both** 55 and 66.\n\nBut **how do I find the smallest such \\( a \\)?** I think I need to identify the common factors of 55 and 66 and see how they influence \\( a \\).\n\n---\n\n## **Exploring the Prime Factors of 55 and 66**\n\n**Next Step:** Let's factorize 55 and 66 to understand their prime components.\n\n- **55:**  \n  - \\( 55 = 5 \\times 11 \\)\n- **66:**  \n  - \\( 66 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 11 \\)\n\n**Reflection:** Interesting, both numbers share the prime factor **11**. Does this mean that \\( a \\) needs to be a multiple of 11? It seems plausible because \\( a \\) sharing a factor of 11 would make \\( \\gcd(a, 55) > 1 \\) and \\( \\gcd(a, 66) > 1 \\).\n\n**Initial Instinct:** Maybe \\( a = 11 \\) is the smallest such number. But wait, I need to verify this.\n\n---\n\n## **Testing \\( a = 11 \\)**\n\n**Check:** Let\u2019s see if \\( a = 11 \\) satisfies the conditions.\n\n- **Modulo 55:**  \n  - \\( \\gcd(11, 55) = 11 \\)  \n  - Since 11 divides 55, \\( 11^{-1} \\) is undefined modulo 55.\n  \n- **Modulo 66:**  \n  - \\( \\gcd(11, 66) = 11 \\)  \n  - Similarly, 11 divides 66, so \\( 11^{-1} \\) is undefined modulo 66.\n\n**Reflection:** Looks good! \\( a = 11 \\) seems to satisfy both conditions. But **is 11 truly the smallest such integer?** Maybe I should consider whether there's a smaller number that still lacks inverses for both moduli.\n\n---\n\n## **Re-evaluating to Ensure \\( a = 11 \\) is the Smallest**\n\n**Thought Process:** What if there's a smaller \\( a \\) that also has no inverses modulo 55 and 66? Perhaps I need to consider other factors or combinations.\n\n**Exploring Further:** Let\u2019s think about the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of 55 and 66. Would the LCM play a role here? Actually, no, because we're looking for the **smallest \\( a \\)** that lacks inverses, not the smallest modulus.\n\n**Alternative Idea:** Maybe I should list out smaller numbers and check their GCDs with 55 and 66.\n\n---\n\n## **Listing Smaller Integers to Confirm**\n\n**Approach:** Let\u2019s check integers smaller than 11 to see if any of them also have undefined inverses modulo 55 and 66.\n\n1. **\\( a = 1 \\):**\n   - \\( \\gcd(1, 55) = 1 \\) and \\( \\gcd(1, 66) = 1 \\)\n   - Inverses exist for both moduli.\n\n2. **\\( a = 2 \\):**\n   - \\( \\gcd(2, 55) = 1 \\) and \\( \\gcd(2, 66) = 2 \\)\n   - Inverse undefined modulo 66, but defined modulo 55.\n\n3. **\\( a = 3 \\):**\n   - \\( \\gcd(3, 55) = 1 \\) and \\( \\gcd(3, 66) = 3 \\)\n   - Inverse undefined modulo 66, but defined modulo 55.\n\n4. **\\( a = 4 \\):**\n   - \\( \\gcd(4, 55) = 1 \\) and \\( \\gcd(4, 66) = 2 \\)\n   - Inverse undefined modulo 66, but defined modulo 55.\n\n5. **\\( a = 5 \\):**\n   - \\( \\gcd(5, 55) = 5 \\) and \\( \\gcd(5, 66) = 1 \\)\n   - Inverse undefined modulo 55, but defined modulo 66.\n\n6. **\\( a = 6 \\):**\n   - \\( \\gcd(6, 55) = 1 \\) and \\( \\gcd(6, 66) = 6 \\)\n   - Inverse undefined modulo 66, but defined modulo 55.\n\n7. **\\( a = 7 \\):**\n   - \\( \\gcd(7, 55) = 1 \\) and \\( \\gcd(7, 66) = 1 \\)\n   - Inverses exist for both moduli.\n\n8. **\\( a = 8 \\):**\n   - \\( \\gcd(8, 55) = 1 \\) and \\( \\gcd(8, 66) = 2 \\)\n   - Inverse undefined modulo 66, but defined modulo 55.\n\n9. **\\( a = 9 \\):**\n   - \\( \\gcd(9, 55) = 1 \\) and \\( \\gcd(9, 66) = 3 \\)\n   - Inverse undefined modulo 66, but defined modulo 55.\n\n10. **\\( a = 10 \\):**\n    - \\( \\gcd(10, 55) = 5 \\) and \\( \\gcd(10, 66) = 2 \\)\n    - Inverse undefined for **both moduli!**\n\n**Reflection:** **Wait, this is interesting!** It seems that \\( a = 10 \\) also has undefined inverses for both moduli. Does this mean my initial choice of \\( a = 11 \\) was incorrect? I need to reconsider.\n\n---\n\n## **Revisiting the Initial Assumption**\n\n**Thought Process:** Initially, I assumed that \\( a = 11 \\) was the smallest integer satisfying the conditions. But after checking smaller numbers, I found that \\( a = 10 \\) also works. This suggests that my first instinct was incomplete.\n\n**Lesson Learned:** Always verify initial assumptions by testing possible cases, especially when dealing with \"smallest\" or \"minimal\" conditions.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Check with \\( a = 10 \\)**\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Modulo 55:**  \n  - \\( \\gcd(10, 55) = 5 \\)  \n  - Since 5 divides 55, \\( 10^{-1} \\) is undefined modulo 55.\n  \n- **Modulo 66:**  \n  - \\( \\gcd(10, 66) = 2 \\)  \n  - Since 2 divides 66, \\( 10^{-1} \\) is undefined modulo 66.\n\n**Reflection:** Yup, \\( a = 10 \\) satisfies both conditions. This means that 10 is indeed the smallest positive integer for which \\( a^{-1} \\) is undefined modulo both 55 and 66. \n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion: Wrapping Up the Thought Process**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Started by understanding what it means for a modular inverse to be undefined and considered prime factors.\n- **Exploration:** Identified common factors (specifically 11) between 55 and 66 but overlooked smaller multipliers.\n- **Verification through Testing:** Listed integers smaller than the initial guess and found a better solution.\n- **Final Check:** Confirmed that \\( a = 10 \\) satisfies both conditions, correcting the initial assumption.\n\n**Final Reflection:** It's crucial to **test multiple possibilities** and **verify assumptions** when solving problems involving minimal conditions. Brainstorming and being open to revisiting initial thoughts helped in arriving at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**\n\nThe smallest positive integer \\( a \\) such that \\( a^{-1} \\) is undefined modulo 55 and 66 is **10**.\n\n---",
  "ground_truth": "An integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{55}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,55)=1$. Similarly, an integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{66}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,66)=1$.\n\nSince we're looking for an integer that doesn't have an inverse modulo either $55$ or $66$, we want $a$ such that $\\gcd(a,55)>1$ and $\\gcd(a,66)>1$. Thus $a$ must be divisible by either $5$ or $11$, and $a$ must also be divisible by either $2$, $3$, or $11$. The smallest positive integer that satisfies both properties is $\\boxed{10}$."
