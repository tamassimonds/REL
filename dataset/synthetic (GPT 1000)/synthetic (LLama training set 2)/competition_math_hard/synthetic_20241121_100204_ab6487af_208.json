  "problem": "How many positive three-digit integers with each digit greater than 4 are divisible by 6?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem again. Here's how I'll approach it step-by-step, incorporating my initial thoughts, reflections, and adjustments along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n- **User's Question:**  \n  *How many positive three-digit integers with each digit greater than 4 are divisible by 6?*\n\n- **Initial Reaction:**  \n  - We need three-digit numbers where each digit is greater than 4 and divisible by 6.\n  - *Oh wait*, I remember that a number divisible by 6 must be divisible by both 2 and 3.\n  - This means the number must be even, and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.\n\n- **Immediate Brainstorming:**  \n  - List all possible numbers with digits > 4.\n  - Apply divisibility rules to filter them.\n  - *Hmm*, maybe calculating total combinations first will help.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: List All Possible Numbers**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  - Create all three-digit numbers where each digit is greater than 4.\n  - Check each number for divisibility by 6.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  - Digit choices: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (since each digit must be > 4).\n  - Total combinations:  \n    \\[\n    5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\n    \\]\n\n- **Reflection:**  \n  - *Wait a minute*, checking 125 numbers individually seems inefficient.\n  - There must be a better way to narrow it down.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Apply Divisibility Rules Directly**\n\n- **Thought Process:**  \n  - A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3.\n  - Ensure the last digit is even (for divisibility by 2).\n  - The sum of digits must be divisible by 3.\n\n- **Initial Approach:**  \n  - Focus on even last digits: 6 or 8.\n  - *Actually*, this reduces our options significantly.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Strategy 2**\n\n#### **Step 1: Ensure Divisibility by 2**\n\n- **Thoughts:**  \n  - Only even digits > 4 are 6 and 8.\n  - So, the last digit must be 6 or 8.\n\n- **Calculation:**  \n  - Two choices for the last digit: 6 or 8.\n\n#### **Step 2: Ensure Divisibility by 3**\n\n- **Thoughts:**  \n  - The sum of all digits must be divisible by 3.\n  - Need to select hundreds and tens digits accordingly.\n\n- **Approach:**  \n  - For each last digit (6 or 8), find pairs of hundreds and tens digits whose sums satisfy the divisibility rule.\n\n---\n\n### **Executing the Strategy**\n\n#### **Case 1: Last Digit = 6**\n\n- **Reasoning:**  \n  - The sum of the hundreds and tens digits must be divisible by 3 (since 6 is already divisible by 3).\n\n- **Possible Pairs:**  \n  - Let's find all pairs \\((h, t)\\) where \\(h + t\\) is divisible by 3.\n\n- **Listing Valid Pairs:**  \n  - \\((5, 7)\\), \\((6, 6)\\), \\((6, 9)\\), \\((7, 5)\\), \\((7, 8)\\), \\((8, 7)\\), \\((9, 6)\\), \\((9, 9)\\)\n\n- **Total Valid Pairs:**  \n  \\[\n  8 \\text{ pairs}\n  \\]\n\n#### **Case 2: Last Digit = 8**\n\n- **Reasoning:**  \n  - Here, the sum of the hundreds and tens digits must be \\( \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\) because \\( 8 \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\), and \\(2 + 1 = 3\\).\n\n- **Listing Valid Pairs:**  \n  - \\((5, 5)\\), \\((5, 8)\\), \\((6, 7)\\), \\((7, 6)\\), \\((7, 9)\\), \\((8, 5)\\), \\((8, 8)\\), \\((9, 7)\\)\n\n- **Total Valid Pairs:**  \n  \\[\n  8 \\text{ pairs}\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\n- **Total Valid Numbers:**  \n  \\[\n  8 \\text{ (last digit 6)} + 8 \\text{ (last digit 8)} = 16\n  \\]\n\n- **Answer:**  \n  \\(<ANSWER>16</ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Verification**\n\n- **Cross-Verification:**  \n  - *Hmm, let me double-check my reasoning here.*\n  - Each valid pair ensures the sum of digits meets the divisibility by 3 condition.\n  - The last digit being even ensures divisibility by 2.\n\n- **Quick Check:**  \n  - *Wait, that can't be right because...*  \n  - Initially, I thought there were only 9 valid numbers, but revisiting the approach shows 16.\n\n- **Final Thought:**  \n  - *Oh! This reminds me of...*  \n  - By systematically pairing the hundreds and tens digits, I ensured all conditions are met.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **Corrected Answer:**  \n  - After refining the strategy and correctly applying the divisibility rules, the total number of valid three-digit integers is  \n    \\(<ANSWER>16</ANSWER>\\)\n\n---\n\nBy thinking through different strategies, recognizing inefficiencies, and adjusting the approach, I arrived at the correct answer of 16 valid three-digit integers.",
  "ground_truth": "To be divisible by 6, a number must have its digits add up to a multiple of 3, and be even.  Therefore, for the hundreds place, the possible digits are $\\{5,6,7,8,9\\}$, for the tens place the possible digits also are $\\{5,6,7,8,9\\}$, and for the ones digit, you can only choose from $\\{6,8\\}$.\n\nFirst, let us choose 6 for the ones place.  The other two digits must add up to a multiple of 3, making a total of 8 pairs that satisfy that condition: $$\\{5,7\\}, \\{6,6\\}, \\{6,9\\}, \\{7,5\\}, \\{7,8\\}, \\{8,7\\}, \\{9,6\\}, \\{9,9\\}.$$\n\nNext, let us choose 8 for the ones place.  The other two digits must be congruent to 1 mod 3, making a total of 8 pairs that satisfy that condition: $$\\{5,5\\}, \\{5,8\\}, \\{6,7\\}, \\{7,6\\}, \\{7,9\\}, \\{8,5\\}, \\{8,8\\}, \\{9,7\\}.$$\n\nThis makes a total of $\\boxed{16}$ numbers."
