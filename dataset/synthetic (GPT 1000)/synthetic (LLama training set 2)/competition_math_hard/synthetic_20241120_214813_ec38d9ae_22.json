    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n- **Volume Given:** \\(12288\\pi\\) cubic inches.\n- **Vertex Angle:** 60 degrees.\n\nHmm, I know that the volume of a cone is related to its height and radius. The vertex angle being 60 degrees makes me think about the geometry of the cone, especially how the radius and height relate through trigonometric functions.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- I could use the volume formula for a cone: \\( V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\).\n- The vertex angle might help me relate the height and radius through trigonometry.\n- Maybe consider the cross-section of the cone as an equilateral triangle since the vertex angle is 60 degrees.\n\nBut wait, is the cross-section necessarily equilateral? Let's think more about that.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Using Volume Formula Directly**\n\nLet me start by writing down the volume formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( V = 12288\\pi \\), I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n12288\\pi = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nHmm, I can divide both sides by \\(\\pi\\) to simplify:\n\n\\[\n12288 = \\frac{1}{3} r^2 h\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n\\[\n36864 = r^2 h\n\\]\n\nOkay, so I have \\( r^2 h = 36864 \\). But I need another equation to relate \\( r \\) and \\( h \\) because I have two variables here.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI need a second equation to connect \\( r \\) and \\( h \\). That\u2019s where the vertex angle comes into play.\n\n**Strategy 2: Using Trigonometry with Vertex Angle**\n\nThinking about the cone\u2019s cross-section:\n\n- The vertex angle is 60 degrees.\n- The cross-section through the vertex is an isosceles triangle with an angle of 60 degrees at the top.\n\nWait, if the vertex angle is 60 degrees, the cross-section triangle isn\u2019t equilateral unless the sides are all equal. But in a cone, the two equal sides are the slant heights, and the base is \\( 2r \\).\n\n**Wait, that can't be right.** I need to rethink this.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Right Triangle in Cross-Section**\n\nLet\u2019s consider half of the cross-section:\n\n- Cutting the triangle in half gives me a right triangle.\n- The angle at the vertex is split into 30 degrees.\n- The opposite side to this 30-degree angle is \\( r \\).\n- The adjacent side is \\( h \\).\n- The hypotenuse is the slant height \\( s \\).\n\nAha! This reminds me of trigonometric ratios:\n\n\\[\n\\tan(30^\\circ) = \\frac{r}{h}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis seems promising because it relates \\( r \\) and \\( h \\) directly.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Trigonometry**\n\nLet\u2019s calculate \\( \\tan(30^\\circ) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\tan(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 0.577\n\\]\n\nSo, I can write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r}{h} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nWhich means:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis makes sense because in a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides is \\( 1:\\sqrt{3}:2 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Substituting Back into Volume Equation**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll substitute \\( r = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} \\) into the volume equation:\n\n\\[\n36864 = \\left( \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2 h\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n36864 = \\frac{h^2}{3} \\times h = \\frac{h^3}{3}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\n110592 = h^3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis equation looks good. Now, I need to solve for \\( h \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Solving for Height \\( h \\)**\n\nLet's find \\( h \\) by taking the cube root:\n\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt[3]{110592}\n\\]\n\nI\u2019ll use a calculator for this:\n\n\\[\nh \\approx 48.0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nLet me do a quick check back with the volume formula to ensure this height makes sense.\n\n- Calculate \\( r = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx \\frac{48}{1.732} \\approx 27.7 \\)\n- Plug back into volume formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (27.7)^2 (48) \\approx 12288\\pi\n\\]\n\nThis matches the given volume, so the calculation is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>The height of the cone is approximately \\(48.0\\) inches.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies and realizing the need to relate the height and radius through trigonometry, I was able to solve for the height correctly. The key was recognizing that the vertex angle leads to a specific trigonometric relationship between the height and radius of the cone. Checking each step ensured that the approach was valid and the final answer was accurate.",

  "ground_truth": "The cross section of the cone is an equilateral triangle. The ratio of the base to the height of an equilateral triangle is 1 to $\\sqrt{3}/2$. In terms of the radius, $r$, the base is $2r$ and the height is $2r\\sqrt{3}/2$, or $r\\sqrt{3}$. Since we know the volume of the cone, we can use the volume formula and solve the equation  \\[(1/3) \\times \\pi \\times r^2 \\times r\\sqrt{3} = 12288\\pi\\]  for $r$. Dividing both sides of the equation by $\\pi$ gives  $(1/3)r^3\\sqrt{3} = 12288$. Tripling both sides, we get $r^3\\sqrt{3} = 36,\\!864$. Now, we want $r\\sqrt{3},$ so we multiply both sides by $3$ to get $r^3\\cdot(\\sqrt{3})^3 = (r\\sqrt{3})^3 = 36,\\!864 \\cdot 3 = 110,\\!592.$ Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $r\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{48.0}.$"
