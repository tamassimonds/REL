  "problem": "How many 3-digit numbers have the property that the units digit is at least twice the tens digit?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem like I naturally would when tackling it for the first time. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their effectiveness, and make adjustments along the way. Here's how I'd approach it step by step:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question is asking about 3-digit numbers where the units digit is at least twice the tens digit. \n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This sounds like a problem involving number properties and relationships between digits. I remember dealing with digit constraints in other problems, so maybe I can apply a similar strategy here.\n  \n- **Brainstorming:** Should I list out examples to get a feel for it? Or maybe use some kind of mathematical formula to count the possibilities? Hmm, let me think...\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I need to find all 3-digit numbers (from 100 to 999).\n  \n- The units digit (\\( U \\)) must be at least twice the tens digit (\\( T \\)), i.e., \\( U \\geq 2T \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a minute:** So, not all digits are involved\u2014only the tens and units digits have this relationship. The hundreds digit (\\( H \\)) can be anything from 1 to 9 since it needs to be a 3-digit number.\n\n- **Possible Strategy:** Maybe I can fix certain digits and see how others vary. Let's explore that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Listing Examples**\n\n- **Idea:** Perhaps listing a few numbers manually will help me see the pattern.\n\n- **Example:** Let's take \\( H = 1 \\), \\( T = 1 \\), then \\( U \\) must be at least \\( 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\). So, 112 works. \n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Hmm:** This could work for small cases, but there are too many numbers to list manually. It\u2019s not efficient.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Listing isn\u2019t practical. I need a better approach.\n\n**Strategy 2: Using Algebraic Inequalities**\n\n- **Idea:** Write the condition mathematically: \\( U \\geq 2T \\). Maybe set up equations or inequalities to solve.\n\n- **Thinking:** But wait, \\( U \\) and \\( T \\) are digits (0-9), so perhaps I can loop through possible values.\n\n**Strategy 3: Iterating Over Possible Digits**\n\n- **Idea:** Loop through all possible values of \\( H \\), \\( T \\), and \\( U \\), and count the combinations that satisfy \\( U \\geq 2T \\).\n\n- **Thought:** This sounds more systematic. Let\u2019s try it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Implementing Strategy 3 (Iterating Over Digits)**\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. **Loop Over Hundreds Digit (\\( H \\)):** Since it\u2019s a 3-digit number, \\( H \\) ranges from 1 to 9.\n\n2. **Loop Over Tens Digit (\\( T \\)):** \\( T \\) ranges from 0 to 9.\n\n3. **Determine Valid Units Digit (\\( U \\)):** For each \\( T \\), \\( U \\) must be at least \\( 2T \\) and also between 0 and 9.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Checking Constraints:** Wait, if \\( 2T \\) exceeds 9, then \\( U \\) would be out of the digit range. So, I need to account for that.\n\n- **Adjustment:** I\u2019ll limit \\( U \\) to a maximum of 9.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Let\u2019s write it out:** For each combination of \\( H \\) and \\( T \\), find all valid \\( U \\) that satisfy \\( U \\geq 2T \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Number of Valid Combinations**\n\n**Proceeding with Calculation:**\n\n**Loop Through Each Digit:**\n\n- **For Each \\( H \\):** I\u2019ll fix \\( H \\) and then check all \\( T \\) and \\( U \\) combinations.\n\n- **For Each \\( T \\):** Determine the minimum \\( U \\) as \\( U \\geq 2T \\).\n\n- **Count Valid \\( U \\):** For each \\( T \\), count how many \\( U \\) satisfy the condition.\n\n**Let\u2019s Start with \\( H = 1 \\):**\n\n- **\\( T = 0 \\):** \\( U \\geq 2 \\times 0 = 0 \\). So, \\( U \\) can be 0 to 9. That\u2019s 10 possibilities.\n\n- **\\( T = 1 \\):** \\( U \\geq 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\). So, \\( U \\) can be 2 to 9. That\u2019s 8 possibilities.\n\n- **\\( T = 2 \\):** \\( U \\geq 4 \\). So, \\( U \\) can be 4 to 9. That\u2019s 6 possibilities.\n\n- **Continue this for \\( T = 3 \\) to \\( T = 9 \\):**\n  \n  - \\( T = 3 \\): \\( U \\geq 6 \\) \u2192 4 possibilities (6, 7, 8, 9)\n  \n  - \\( T = 4 \\): \\( U \\geq 8 \\) \u2192 2 possibilities (8, 9)\n  \n  - \\( T = 5 \\) to \\( T = 9 \\): \\( U \\geq 10 \\) or more, which is impossible since \\( U \\) must be a single digit \u2192 0 possibilities.\n\n**Summing Up for \\( H = 1 \\):**\n\n- Total valid combinations for \\( H = 1 \\): \n  - \\( T = 0 \\): 10\n  - \\( T = 1 \\): 8\n  - \\( T = 2 \\): 6\n  - \\( T = 3 \\): 4\n  - \\( T = 4 \\): 2\n  - \\( T = 5 \\) to \\( T = 9 \\): 0\n\n- **Total = 10 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 30**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a second:** If \\( H = 1 \\) yields 30 valid numbers, and \\( H \\) ranges from 1 to 9, does this pattern hold for all \\( H \\)?\n\n- **Assumption:** Since the condition only involves \\( T \\) and \\( U \\), and \\( H \\) doesn\u2019t affect these, the same count should apply to each \\( H \\).\n\n**Checking Assumption:**\n\n- **Let\u2019s verify:** If I repeat the process for \\( H = 2 \\), do I get the same total?\n\n**Proceeding with \\( H = 2 \\):**\n\n- **\\( T = 0 \\):** \\( U \\geq 0 \\) \u2192 10 possibilities\n  \n- **\\( T = 1 \\):** \\( U \\geq 2 \\) \u2192 8 possibilities\n  \n- **\\( T = 2 \\):** \\( U \\geq 4 \\) \u2192 6 possibilities\n  \n- **\\( T = 3 \\):** \\( U \\geq 6 \\) \u2192 4 possibilities\n  \n- **\\( T = 4 \\):** \\( U \\geq 8 \\) \u2192 2 possibilities\n  \n- **\\( T = 5 \\) to \\( T = 9 \\):** \\( U \\geq 10 \\) \u2192 0 possibilities\n\n- **Total = 30**\n\n**Observation:**\n\n- **Consistent Pattern:** The total remains 30 for \\( H = 2 \\). It seems that \\( H \\) doesn\u2019t affect the count.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Generalizing:** Since \\( H \\) doesn\u2019t play a role in the condition \\( U \\geq 2T \\), the same number of valid combinations (30) applies for each \\( H \\) from 1 to 9.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\n**Calculating Total Valid Numbers:**\n\n- **Total for each \\( H \\):** 30 valid numbers\n\n- **Number of possible \\( H \\):** 9 (from 1 to 9)\n\n- **Total valid 3-digit numbers = \\( 30 \\times 9 = 270 \\)**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does this number make sense? Out of 900 total 3-digit numbers (from 100 to 999), having 270 satisfy the condition seems plausible.\n\n- **Verification:** Since each \\( H \\) behaves independently with respect to \\( T \\) and \\( U \\), multiplying by 9 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\(<\\text{ANSWER}>270 \\text{ three-digit numbers have the property that the units digit is at least twice the tens digit.}<\\text{ANSWER}>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Validating the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Is there another way to confirm this?** Maybe I can double-check by considering extreme cases or using a different method to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Combinatorial Approach**\n\n- **Idea:** Instead of iterating, use combinatorics to compute the number of valid \\( T \\) and \\( U \\) pairs directly.\n\n- **Approach:**\n\n  1. **For each \\( T \\):** Determine the number of valid \\( U \\) such that \\( U \\geq 2T \\) and \\( U \\leq 9 \\).\n\n  2. **Sum them up for all \\( T \\):**\n\n     - \\( T = 0 \\): \\( U = 0 \\) to 9 \u2192 10 possibilities\n     \n     - \\( T = 1 \\): \\( U = 2 \\) to 9 \u2192 8 possibilities\n     \n     - \\( T = 2 \\): \\( U = 4 \\) to 9 \u2192 6 possibilities\n     \n     - \\( T = 3 \\): \\( U = 6 \\) to 9 \u2192 4 possibilities\n     \n     - \\( T = 4 \\): \\( U = 8 \\) to 9 \u2192 2 possibilities\n     \n     - \\( T = 5 \\) to \\( T = 9 \\): \\( U \\geq 10 \\) \u2192 0 possibilities\n\n  3. **Total for \\( T \\) from 0 to 9:**\n     \n     - \\( 10 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 30 \\)\n\n  4. **Multiply by the number of \\( H \\):** \\( 30 \\times 9 = 270 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Consistent Result:** Both strategies (iterative and combinatorial) yield the same total of 270, which strengthens the validity of the answer.\n\n**Final Confirmation:**\n\n\\(<\\text{ANSWER}>270 \\text{ three-digit numbers satisfy the condition that the units digit is at least twice the tens digit.}<\\text{ANSWER}>\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, implementing an effective approach, and validating the results through multiple methods, we confidently conclude that there are **270** three-digit numbers where the units digit is at least twice the tens digit.",
