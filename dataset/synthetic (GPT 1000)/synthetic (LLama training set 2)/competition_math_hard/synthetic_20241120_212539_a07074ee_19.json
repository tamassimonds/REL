    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it for the first time. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and make sure to check my work as I go along. Here's how I'd approach it:\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- Okay, Krista is doubling the amount of money she puts into her bank each day, starting with 1 cent on Sunday. This doubling continues for two weeks (14 days total).\n- I need to figure out on which day the total amount in the bank first exceeds \\$2.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n- Doubling each day sounds like exponential growth. I remember problems involving powers of 2 behaving this way.\n- Since \\$2 is 200 cents, I should probably think in terms of cents to avoid dealing with decimals.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Possible Approaches:**\n1. **Calculate Day by Day:**\n   - Compute the amount deposited each day and keep a running total until I exceed 200 cents.\n2. **Use Mathematical Formulas:**\n   - Maybe there's a formula for the sum of a geometric series that could help.\n3. **Estimate Using Patterns:**\n   - Look for patterns in the amounts to predict when the total will exceed \\$2 without calculating each day explicitly.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Calculating day by day seems straightforward and ensures accuracy, but it might be time-consuming.\n- Using a formula could be faster but might be overkill for this problem.\n- Estimating might lead to errors, so I\u2019ll prefer precise calculations.\n\n**Decision:**\n- I'll start by calculating day by day to ensure accuracy. If it turns out to be too slow, I'll reconsider.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Starting Point:**\n- Begin with Sunday (Day 1) and continue through each day, doubling the previous day's deposit.\n\n**Day 1 (Sunday):**\n- **Deposit:** 1 cent\n- **Total:** 1 cent\n- *Reflection:* Just starting, so total is well below 200 cents.\n\n**Day 2 (Monday):**\n- **Deposit:** 2 cents (double of 1 cent)\n- **Total:** 1 + 2 = 3 cents\n- *Check:* Still way below 200 cents.\n\n**Day 3 (Tuesday):**\n- **Deposit:** 4 cents (double of 2 cents)\n- **Total:** 3 + 4 = 7 cents\n- *Check:* Incrementing nicely, but still far from the target.\n\n**Day 4 (Wednesday):**\n- **Deposit:** 8 cents\n- **Total:** 7 + 8 = 15 cents\n- *Reflection:* The total is increasing rapidly, but still not close to 200 cents.\n\n**Day 5 (Thursday):**\n- **Deposit:** 16 cents\n- **Total:** 15 + 16 = 31 cents\n- *Check:* The growth is exponential, making significant jumps each day.\n\n**Day 6 (Friday):**\n- **Deposit:** 32 cents\n- **Total:** 31 + 32 = 63 cents\n- *Check:* More than halfway to 100 cents.\n\n**Day 7 (Saturday):**\n- **Deposit:** 64 cents\n- **Total:** 63 + 64 = 127 cents\n- *Reflection:* Now over halfway to 200 cents. The doubling is having a big impact.\n\n**Day 8 (Sunday):**\n- **Deposit:** 128 cents\n- **Total:** 127 + 128 = 255 cents\n- *Check:* Ah, I've exceeded 200 cents!\n\n### **Analyzing the Result**\n\n**Day of the Week:**\n- The total first exceeds \\$2 on Day 8, which is Sunday.\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n- Let me double-check by adding up the totals again:\n  - Days 1-7 total: 127 cents\n  - Adding Day 8 deposit: 127 + 128 = 255 cents\n- Yes, 255 cents is indeed over 200 cents.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The day-by-day approach worked well here. It was straightforward and didn't take too long. \n\n### **Alternative Approach: Using a Formula**\n\n**Thinking it Through:**\n- If I wanted to use a formula, I could recognize this as a geometric series where each term is double the previous one.\n- The sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of a geometric series is given by:\n  \\[\n  S_n = a \\times \\frac{(r^n - 1)}{r - 1}\n  \\]\n  where \\( a \\) is the first term (1 cent) and \\( r \\) is the common ratio (2).\n\n**Applying the Formula:**\n- Plugging in the values:\n  \\[\n  S_n = 1 \\times \\frac{(2^n - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^n - 1\n  \\]\n- I need \\( S_n \\) to exceed 200 cents:\n  \\[\n  2^n - 1 > 200 \\\\\n  2^n > 201\n  \\]\n- Solving for \\( n \\):\n  \\[\n  n > \\log_2(201) \\approx 7.65\n  \\]\n  Since \\( n \\) must be a whole number, \\( n = 8 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- This confirms that Day 8 is the first day the total exceeds \\$2.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **First Impressions:** At first, I thought calculating each day might be tedious, but it turned out to be manageable.\n- **Checking Work:** Regularly checking the totals after each day helped ensure accuracy.\n- **Alternative Methods:** Exploring the formula not only confirmed my initial approach but also deepened my understanding of the problem.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n- **Day of the Week:** Sunday\n- **Day Number:** 8\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with constant reflections and checks, ensured that I arrived at the correct solution efficiently.",

  "ground_truth": "The formula for a geometric series is $\\frac{a-ar^n}{1-r}$. Taking $a$ to be the initial $1$-cent deposit and $n$ to be the number of days Krista had money in her bank so far, we have the inequality $$\\frac{1-2^n}{1-2}\\geq 200 \\Rightarrow 1-2^n\\leq -200 \\Rightarrow 201 \\leq 2^n.$$The smallest power of 2 that is greater than 201 is $2^8$.  Thus, $n=8$ and $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$ is 7 days away from day $1$."
