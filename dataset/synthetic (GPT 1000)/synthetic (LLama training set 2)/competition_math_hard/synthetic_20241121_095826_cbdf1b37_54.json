  "problem": "At a certain university, the division of mathematical sciences consists of the departments of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. There are two male and two female professors in each department. A committee of six professors is to contain three men and three women and must also contain two professors from each of the three departments. Find the number of possible committees that can be formed subject to these requirements.\n",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem again. I'll walk through my original thought process, identify where I went off track, and adjust my approach to arrive at the correct solution. Just like when I'm solving a problem on paper, I'll let my natural reflections and realizations guide me.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, we've got a university with three departments: Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. Each has two male and two female professors. We need to form a committee of six professors with:\n\n- Three men and three women.\n- Two professors from each department.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis sounds like a classic combinatorics problem with multiple constraints. I'm reminded of problems where we need to balance selections across different categories. But honestly, it feels a bit tricky because satisfying both gender and departmental requirements simultaneously can be complex.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Select by Gender First:** Choose three men and three women, then check if departmental constraints are met.\n\n2. **Select by Department First:** Pick two professors from each department, ensuring gender balance.\n\n3. **Mixed Approach:** Maybe combine both strategies or consider different cases.\n\nI'm not sure which is best yet, so I'll start exploring.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Combinations by Gender First**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's attempt to select three men and three women from the total pool of professors.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Total Male Professors:** 6 (2 per department)\n   \n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Total Female Professors:** 6\n   \n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Total Combinations:**  \n   \n   \\[\n   20 \\times 20 = 400\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**  \nHmm... **wait a minute!** This gives me 400 possible committees based purely on gender selection. But looking at it again, this doesn't account for the requirement of having two professors from each department. So, many of these combinations likely violate the departmental constraint.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis approach is too broad and doesn't satisfy all the conditions. I need to incorporate the departmental requirement more explicitly. **Time to rethink and pivot.**\n\n---\n\n### **Pivoting to Strategy 2: Department-by-Department Selection**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's try selecting two professors (one male and one female) from each department. This should inherently satisfy both gender balance and departmental representation.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **For Each Department:**\n   \n   - **Mathematics:**  \n     - Select one male:  \n       \n       \\[\n       \\binom{2}{1} = 2\n       \\]\n       \n     - Select one female:  \n       \n       \\[\n       \\binom{2}{1} = 2\n       \\]\n       \n     - Total for Math:  \n       \n       \\[\n       2 \\times 2 = 4\n       \\]\n   \n   - **Statistics:**  \n     \n     \\[\n     2 \\times 2 = 4\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Computer Science:**  \n     \n     \\[\n     2 \\times 2 = 4\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Total Combinations Across All Departments:**\n   \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**  \nSo, this approach yields 64 possible committees. **But hold on...** Is this really capturing all valid combinations? Actually, looking at this again, I'm only considering the case where one man and one woman are selected from each department. **Hmm, let me double-check my reasoning here.** There might be other valid scenarios I'm missing.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis strategy only accounts for one specific case. I realize now that there are other ways to distribute the selections that still satisfy all constraints. **I need to broaden my approach.**\n\n---\n\n### **Introducing a New Insight: Considering Multiple Cases**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nPerhaps I need to consider different cases to capture all possible valid committees:\n\n1. **Case 1:** One man and one woman from each department.\n\n2. **Case 2:** Two men from one department, two women from another, and one man and one woman from the third department.\n\nThis reminds me of strategies where multiple scenarios need to be accounted for separately.\n\n**Initial Uncertainty:**  \nI'm still a bit unsure if this will cover everything, but it's worth exploring. **Let's see where it takes us.**\n\n---\n\n### **Case 1: One Man and One Woman from Each Department**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **For Each Department:**\n   \n   - **Mathematics:**  \n     \n     \\[\n     \\binom{2}{1} \\times \\binom{2}{1} = 4\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Statistics:**  \n     \n     \\[\n     4\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Computer Science:**  \n     \n     \\[\n     4\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Total Combinations for Case 1:**\n   \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**  \nThis matches my previous calculation, so **that part is correct.** But now I see that this only covers one scenario. **There's more to consider.**\n\n---\n\n### **Case 2: Two Men from One Department, Two Women from Another, and One Man and One Woman from the Third Department**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI need to account for the possibility where the gender balance is maintained across departments differently. **Actually, this adds more complexity but ensures all valid committees are considered.**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Selecting Departments:**\n   \n   - Choose which department will have two men, which will have two women, and which will have one man and one woman.\n   \n   - There are **3! = 6** ways to assign these roles to the departments.\n\n2. **Within Each Assignment:**\n   \n   - **Two Men from One Department:**  \n     \n     \\[\n     \\binom{2}{2} = 1\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Two Women from Another Department:**  \n     \n     \\[\n     \\binom{2}{2} = 1\n     \\]\n   \n   - **One Man and One Woman from the Third Department:**  \n     \n     \\[\n     \\binom{2}{1} \\times \\binom{2}{1} = 4\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Total Combinations for Each Assignment:**\n   \n   \\[\n   1 \\times 1 \\times 4 = 4\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Total Combinations for Case 2:**\n   \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 6 = 24\n   \\]\n   \n**Reflection:**  \nOh! **This is an aha moment.** Initially, I missed these additional combinations. By considering this second case, I'm capturing more valid committees that satisfy all constraints.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nAdding both cases together:\n\n\\[\n64\\ (\\text{Case 1}) + 24\\ (\\text{Case 2}) = 88\n\\]\n\n**Hmm, let me think about whether this makes sense.** Originally, I only accounted for 64 committees, but now I've identified an additional 24. **This feels more complete.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Validation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, I want to ensure there's no overcounting or missed conditions. **Let's break it down:**\n\n- **Case 1:** All departments have one man and one woman. Total: 64.\n- **Case 2:** Two departments have two professors of the same gender, and the third has one of each. Total: 24.\n\n**Total Valid Committees:**\n\n\\[\n64 + 24 = 88\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nThis comprehensive approach accounts for all possible valid committees. **I'm confident now that the total number is 88.**\n\n---\n\n### **ANSWER: 88**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe number of possible committees that can be formed, satisfying all the given requirements, is **88**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Started with basic gender selection but realized it was too broad.\n  \n- **Reflection and Adjustment:** Recognized the need to incorporate departmental constraints more explicitly. Pivoted to selecting by department but initially missed additional valid cases.\n  \n- **Introducing Multiple Cases:** Identified that multiple scenarios need to be considered to capture all valid committees.\n  \n- **Calculating Each Case:** Carefully calculated both cases, ensuring all constraints are satisfied.\n  \n- **Final Validation:** Added the results of both cases to arrive at the correct total.\n\nBy thoughtfully exploring different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and adjusting the approach as needed, I arrived at the correct solution while ensuring all constraints were satisfied.",
  "ground_truth": "There are two cases:\nCase 1: One man and one woman is chosen from each department.\nCase 2: Two men are chosen from one department, two women are chosen from another department, and one man and one woman are chosen from the third department.\nFor the first case, in each department there are ${{2}\\choose{1}} \\times {{2}\\choose{1}} = 4$ ways to choose one man and one woman. Thus there are $4^3 = 64$ total possibilities conforming to case 1.\nFor the second case, there is only ${{2}\\choose{2}} = 1$ way to choose two professors of the same gender from a department, and again there are $4$ ways to choose one man and one woman. Thus there are $1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 4 = 4$ ways to choose two men from one department, two women from another department, and one man and one woman from the third department. However, there are $3! = 6$ different department orders, so the total number of possibilities conforming to case 2 is $4 \\cdot 6 = 24$.\nSumming these two values yields the final answer: $64 + 24 = \\boxed{88}$."
