  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, reflect often, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, so we have a set \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) with 90 elements taken from \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 100\\}\\). We need to find the number of possible sums \\(S\\) of these elements.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This reminds me of problems involving subsets and their sums.\n- I think it might relate to combinatorics or possibly using the concept of sums of sequences.\n- But wait, dealing with large sets like this might require a clever strategy to avoid brute force.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Calculate the Total Sum:** Find the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 and see how removing certain elements affects the sum.\n2. **Consider Complement Sets:** Instead of picking 90 elements, think about the 10 elements not included.\n3. **Explore Symmetry:** Maybe the sums have a symmetrical property that can be exploited.\n4. **Use Mathematical Formulas:** Perhaps use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- If I find the total sum of 1 to 100, I can determine how omitting certain numbers affects the sum.\n- This seems feasible since knowing the total sum can help in calculating the sums of subsets.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Yeah, calculating the total sum first makes sense. It gives a baseline to work from.\n\nAlright, let's proceed with this approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Sum of 1 to 100**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I know that the sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is given by the formula:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n  \\]\n- Here, \\(n = 100\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{100 \\times 101}{2} = 5050\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Okay, so the total sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 is 5050.\n- If we select all 100 numbers, the sum is 5050.\n- Since we're selecting 90 numbers, we're essentially omitting 10 numbers.\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\n- This means the sum \\(S\\) of our set \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is \\(5050\\) minus the sum of the 10 numbers we omit.\n- Hmm, this might simplify the problem significantly.\n\nAlright, moving on!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Consider the Sum of the Omitted Elements**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- If \\(S\\) is the sum of the 90 elements, then:\n  \\[\n  S = 5050 - \\text{sum of the 10 omitted elements}\n  \\]\n- So, the problem boils down to finding the possible sums of the 10 numbers we omit.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **List All Combinations:** Calculate the sums of all possible sets of 10 numbers from 1 to 100.\n2. **Use Combinatorial Techniques:** Leverage combinatorics to determine the range of possible sums.\n3. **Apply Symmetry:** Maybe there's a pattern or symmetry in the sums that can be exploited.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Listing all combinations seems impractical since there are \\(\\binom{100}{10}\\) possible sets.\n- That's a huge number, so brute force is out.\n- I need a more elegant approach.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- I think considering the sums of the omitted elements and how they relate to the total sum is the right path.\n- Perhaps using the concept of minimum and maximum sums can help.\n\nOkay, let's proceed by determining the minimum and maximum possible sums of the omitted elements.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Minimum and Maximum Possible Sums of the Omitted Elements**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To find the range of possible sums \\(S\\), I need to know the smallest and largest sums that can be obtained by omitting 10 numbers.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- **Minimum Sum of Omitted Elements:** \n  - Omitting the smallest 10 numbers: \\(1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 10\\)\n  - Using the sum formula:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{10 \\times 11}{2} = 55\n    \\]\n  \n- **Maximum Sum of Omitted Elements:**\n  - Omitting the largest 10 numbers: \\(91 + 92 + \\ldots + 100\\)\n  - Calculate the sum:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Sum} = \\frac{100 \\times 101}{2} - \\frac{90 \\times 91}{2} = 5050 - 4095 = 955\n    \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- So, the sum of the omitted elements can range from 55 to 955.\n- Consequently, the sum \\(S\\) of the selected 90 elements can range from:\n  \\[\n  S = 5050 - 955 = 4095 \\quad \\text{(minimum \\(S\\))}\n  \\]\n  to\n  \\[\n  S = 5050 - 55 = 4995 \\quad \\text{(maximum \\(S\\))}\n  \\]\n  \n- This gives us a range for \\(S\\) from 4095 to 4995.\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this make sense? Yes, because omitting the smallest numbers increases \\(S\\), and omitting the largest numbers decreases \\(S\\).\n\nGreat, now I have the range for \\(S\\). Let's move on to analyzing whether all sums within this range are possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the Possible Values of \\(S\\) Within This Range**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, I need to determine whether all integer sums between 4095 and 4995 are possible or if there are gaps.\n- This reminds me of problems involving the sums of subsets and whether all intermediate sums can be achieved.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Determine Increment Steps:** See if \\(S\\) can take all values in the range by analyzing how sums change when different sets of numbers are omitted.\n2. **Use the Properties of Numbers:** Consider the arithmetic properties of the numbers involved to see if certain sums are unavoidable.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- If I can change the sum \\(S\\) by small increments through different combinations of omitted numbers, then all sums in the range are possible.\n- But how do I ensure that?\n\n**Reflection:**\n- I might need to calculate the possible increments in \\(S\\) based on which numbers are omitted.\n- This could be tricky, but let's explore it.\n\nLet's explore incremental changes in \\(S\\) to see if all sums are possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Exploring Incremental Changes in \\(S\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Each time we change which numbers are omitted, the sum \\(S\\) changes by the sum of the numbers added or removed.\n- If I can make \\(S\\) increase or decrease by any integer within the range, then all sums are possible.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- The smallest number we can omit is 1, and the largest is 100.\n- By carefully selecting which numbers to omit, we can adjust \\(S\\) by varying amounts.\n\n**Possible Approach:**\n- Use the fact that the numbers from 1 to 100 are consecutive integers.\n- By omitting different combinations of numbers, especially focusing on smaller numbers, we can finely adjust \\(S\\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- If I omit a small number and replace it with a slightly larger number, \\(S\\) changes by the difference between those numbers.\n- This suggests that I can make \\(S\\) change by small increments.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This approach seems promising. If I can control the increments, then all sums within the range are achievable.\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\n- But do I need to verify that every sum is possible, or is there a better way to prove it?\n\n**New Idea:**\n- Maybe I can use the concept of **completeness** in number sums: if I can generate all necessary increments, then all sums are possible.\n\nAlright, let's ensure all sums are possible by checking incremental changes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Ensuring All Sums Are Possible**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To ensure that all sums from 4095 to 4995 are possible, I need to show that for any integer \\(k\\) within this range, there exists a set of 10 numbers whose sum is \\(k\\).\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Prove Completeness:** Show that for any sum within the range, there is a corresponding set of omitted numbers.\n2. **Use Mathematical Induction:** Perhaps use induction to prove that all sums are achievable.\n3. **Leverage Symmetry and Patterns:** Look for patterns in how sums change with different omitted sets.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Proving completeness directly might be challenging, but if I can demonstrate that small incremental changes are possible, that would suffice.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- If I can adjust \\(S\\) by increments of 1, then all sums in the range are possible.\n- Let's see if that's feasible.\n\nAlright, let's check if we can adjust \\(S\\) by increments of 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Checking Incremental Changes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Can I adjust the sum \\(S\\) by exactly 1 by changing which numbers are omitted?\n- If so, then I can reach any sum within the range.\n\n**Possible Approach:**\n- Consider swapping one omitted number with another to change the sum by a specific amount.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Suppose I omit number \\(x\\) and include number \\(y\\) instead.\n- The change in sum \\(S\\) would be \\(y - x\\).\n\n**Example:**\n- If I omit 10 and include 11, the sum \\(S\\) increases by \\(11 - 10 = 1\\).\n- Similarly, if I omit 11 and include 10, the sum \\(S\\) decreases by 1.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Since the numbers from 1 to 100 are consecutive, I can always find pairs of numbers whose difference is 1.\n- This means I can adjust \\(S\\) by increments of 1.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This is powerful! It suggests that I can make \\(S\\) take any value within the range by carefully selecting which numbers to omit.\n\n**Wait a Minute:**\n- But what about larger increments? Do I need to worry about them?\n\n**New Idea:**\n- If I can adjust by increments of 1, larger increments are just repeated applications of this smaller increment.\n\nAlright, it looks like I can adjust \\(S\\) by increments of 1. Let's conclude that all sums are possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Concluding That All Sums Are Possible**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since I can adjust \\(S\\) by increments of 1, starting from the minimum sum of 4095 up to the maximum sum of 4995, all integer sums in this range are achievable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Therefore, the number of possible values of \\(S\\) is the total number of integers from 4095 to 4995 inclusive.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- The number of integers in this range is:\n  \\[\n  4995 - 4095 + 1 = 901\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, because we have accounted for every possible sum by ensuring that \\(S\\) can be adjusted by increments of 1 throughout the entire range.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick sanity check:** The range is 901 integers, which aligns with our earlier calculations.\n  \n- **Verification:** Since we can make \\(S\\) take any value within the range by adjusting which numbers are omitted, all 901 sums are indeed possible.\n\nAlright, everything checks out!\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\nThe number of possible values of \\(S\\) is **901**.\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstorming and Strategy Selection:** Started by considering multiple strategies, including calculating the total sum and thinking about omitted elements.\n  \n- **Calculating Total Sum:** Found the total sum of numbers 1 to 100 to be 5050.\n  \n- **Focusing on Omitted Elements:** Realized that the sum \\(S\\) is determined by the sum of the 10 omitted numbers.\n  \n- **Determining Range of \\(S\\):** Calculated the minimum and maximum sums of the omitted elements, leading to a range for \\(S\\) from 4095 to 4995.\n  \n- **Ensuring All Sums Are Possible:** Explored the ability to adjust \\(S\\) by increments of 1 through strategic omission and inclusion of numbers.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** Confirmed that all sums within the range are achievable, resulting in 901 possible values for \\(S\\).\n\nThroughout the process, frequent reflections and checks ensured that the approach was correct and that all possibilities were accounted for. By thinking aloud and exploring different strategies, the solution was reached systematically and confidently.\n\n---\n\nThat wraps it up! By carefully considering the sums of omitted elements and ensuring that all possible sums within the desired range are achievable, we've determined that there are **901** possible values for \\(S\\).",
  "ground_truth": "The smallest $S$ is $1+2+ \\ldots +90 = 91 \\cdot 45 = 4095$. The largest $S$ is $11+12+ \\ldots +100=111\\cdot 45=4995$. All numbers between $4095$ and $4995$ are possible values of S, so the number of possible values of S is $4995-4095+1=901$.\nAlternatively, for ease of calculation, let set $\\mathcal{B}$ be a 10-element subset of $\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,100\\}$, and let $T$ be the sum of the elements of $\\mathcal{B}$. Note that the number of possible $S$ is the number of possible $T=5050-S$. The smallest possible $T$ is $1+2+ \\ldots +10 = 55$ and the largest is $91+92+ \\ldots + 100 = 955$, so the number of possible values of T, and therefore S, is $955-55+1=\\boxed{901}$."
