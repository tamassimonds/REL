  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, we have a parabola defined by \\( y = (x-2)^2 + 3 \\). The problem involves rotating this parabola 180 degrees about its vertex, then shifting it left and down. Finally, we need to find the zeros of the resulting parabola and compute \\( a + b \\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of transformations of parabolas\u2014translations and reflections. But the rotation part is a bit tricky. I've dealt with flipping parabolas before, like reflecting over an axis, but a full 180-degree rotation might involve more.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Understanding the Rotation:** Maybe rotating 180 degrees about the vertex flips the parabola upside down. Does it change the orientation along both axes?\n  2. **Applying Translations:** After rotation, shifting the parabola left and down should be straightforward.\n  3. **Finding the New Equation:** Writing the equation after all transformations to find the zeros.\n  4. **Checking for Symmetry:** Perhaps exploiting symmetry could simplify finding \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n- **Unsure Moment:** I'm not entirely clear on how the 180-degree rotation affects the equation. Does it involve negating both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) components?\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the First Strategy: Understanding Rotation**\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing the Original Parabola**\n\n- The given equation is \\( y = (x-2)^2 + 3 \\).\n- **Vertex Form:** I recognize this is in vertex form \\( y = (x-h)^2 + k \\) with \\( h = 2 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\). So, the vertex is at \\( (2, 3) \\).\n- **Direction:** Since the coefficient of \\( (x-2)^2 \\) is positive, the parabola opens upwards.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Reflection:** If we're rotating 180 degrees about the vertex, I think the parabola should end up opening downwards. This is akin to reflecting it over both the x-axis and y-axis.\n\n**Step 2: Applying 180-Degree Rotation About the Vertex**\n\n- **Understanding Rotation:** A 180-degree rotation around a point should invert both axes relative to that point. So, the parabola should flip upside down.\n\n- **Modifying the Equation:**\n  - Before rotation, at the vertex \\( (2, 3) \\), the parabola opens upwards.\n  - **After Rotation:** The parabola should open downwards with the same vertex.\n\n- **New Equation Idea:** \n  - To flip it, I can multiply the equation by \\(-1\\): \n  \\[\n  y = -[(x-2)^2 + 3]\n  \\]\n  - Simplifying:\n  \\[\n  y = -(x-2)^2 - 3\n  \\]\n\n**Checking Work:**\n- **Quick Check:** Does this make sense? The negative sign should invert the parabola, making it open downwards. The vertex remains unchanged at \\( (2, 3) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Aha Moment:** Yes, that seems correct. The parabola is now opening downwards, which aligns with the rotation.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding to the Next Step: Shifting the Parabola**\n\n**Step 3: Shifting 3 Units to the Left**\n\n- **Translation Left:** Moving the parabola 3 units left affects the \\( x \\)-coordinates.\n\n- **Modifying \\( x \\):**\n  - Replace \\( x \\) with \\( x + 3 \\) in the equation to shift left:\n  \\[\n  y = -[(x+3-2)^2] - 3 = -(x+1)^2 - 3\n  \\]\n\n**Checking Work:**\n- **Quick Check:** Substituting \\( x = 2 \\) in the new equation should give the original vertex shifted left:\n  \\[\n  x = 2 - 3 = -1 \n  \\]\n  So, the new vertex is \\( (-1, 3) \\).\n- **Verification:** Wait, that doesn\u2019t seem right. The vertex was \\( (2, 3) \\), and shifting left by 3 should make it \\( (-1, 3) \\), but my equation suggests \\( (-1, -3) \\).\n\n**Realization:**\n- **Mistake Detected:** I see where I went wrong. The constant term in the equation should adjust to maintain the correct vertex.\n\n---\n\n### **Correcting the Mistake: Adjusting the Constant Term**\n\n**Step 4: Correcting the Equation After Left Shift**\n\n- **Re-evaluating the Shift:**\n  - To maintain the vertex at \\( (-1, 3) \\), I need to adjust the constant term.\n  - Original equation after rotation: \n  \\[\n  y = -(x-2)^2 - 3\n  \\]\n  - Shifting left by 3: \n  \\[\n  x' = x + 3\n  \\]\n  - Substituting:\n  \\[\n  y = -(x'+1)^2 - 3 \n  \\]\n  (since \\( x' = x + 3 \\) implies \\( x = x' - 3 \\), and \\( x - 2 = (x' - 3) - 2 = x' - 5 \\)))\n\n- **Simplifying:**\n  \\[\n  y = -[(x+3)-2]^2 - 3 = -(x+1)^2 - 3\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does It Make Sense Now?:** Yes, shifting left by 3 aligns the vertex correctly to \\( (-1, 3) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Continuing with the Next Shift: Moving 2 Units Down**\n\n**Step 5: Shifting 2 Units Down**\n\n- **Translation Down:** This affects the \\( y \\)-coordinate by subtracting 2 from the entire equation.\n\n- **Adjusting the Equation:**\n  \\[\n  y = -(x+1)^2 - 3 - 2 = -(x+1)^2 - 5\n  \\]\n\n**Checking Work:**\n- **Quick Check:** The vertex should now be at \\( (-1, 1) \\) because:\n  - Original vertex after left shift: \\( (-1, 3) \\)\n  - Moving down by 2: \\( (-1, 1) \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **All Set:** The transformations seem correct so far. The parabola is now opening downwards with its vertex at \\( (-1, 1) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Step: Finding the Zeros of the Transformed Parabola**\n\n**Step 6: Solving for Zeros \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)**\n\n- **Setting \\( y = 0 \\):**\n  \\[\n  0 = -(x+1)^2 - 5\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solving the Equation:**\n  \\[\n  -(x+1)^2 - 5 = 0 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -(x+1)^2 = 5 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (x+1)^2 = -5 \n  \\]\n  \n- **Realization:**\n  - **Wait a Minute:** The square of a real number cannot be negative. This implies there are no real zeros.\n\n**User Prompt Clearing Thoughts:**\n- **Confusion:** Hold on, the problem states that the resulting parabola has zeros at \\( x = a \\) and \\( x = b \\). But my calculations suggest no real zeros.\n\n**Re-evaluating Strategy:**\n- **Possible Mistake:** Maybe I misunderstood the rotation or the transformations. Let's reconsider the initial steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting the Rotation Concept**\n\n**Step 7: Re-examining the 180-Degree Rotation**\n\n- **Original Thought:** I treated the rotation as simply flipping the parabola upside down by negating the equation.\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Perhaps a 180-degree rotation about the vertex involves more than just negating the \\( y \\)-values. It might also affect the orientation of the parabola in the coordinate plane.\n\n**Exploring the Correct Rotation:**\n- **Understanding Rotation:** A 180-degree rotation about a point means that every point on the parabola is rotated around the vertex. This could mean transforming both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) coordinates relative to the vertex.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n- **Expressing \\( y \\) in Terms of the Vertex:** Let's rewrite the equation in terms of the vertex and then apply the rotation.\n\n**Step 8: Rewriting the Original Equation**\n\n- **Original Equation:**\n  \\[\n  y = (x-2)^2 + 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Vertex Form:** \n  \\[\n  y - 3 = (x - 2)^2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Expressing in Terms of Vertex:** \n  \\[\n  (y - 3) = (x - 2)^2\n  \\]\n  \n**Thought Process:**\n- **Preparing for Rotation:** By centering the equation around the vertex, it might be easier to apply the rotation transformation.\n\n---\n\n### **Applying 180-Degree Rotation Correctly**\n\n**Step 9: Applying Rotation to Coordinates**\n\n- **Rotation Formula:** A 180-degree rotation about a point \\( (h, k) \\) transforms \\( (x, y) \\) to \\( (2h - x, 2k - y) \\).\n\n**Applying to Our Vertex \\( (2, 3) \\):**\n- **New Coordinates:** For every point \\( (x, y) \\) on the parabola, the rotated point is \\( (4 - x, 6 - y) \\).\n\n**Realization:**\n- **Wait:** This seems overly complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to represent the rotation in terms of the equation itself.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n- **Negating Both Axes Relative to the Vertex:** Perhaps after rotation, the parabola's equation becomes \\( y = -[(x-2)^2 + 3] \\), but considering the entire transformation including shifts.\n\n**Step 10: Correcting the Rotation**\n\n- **Flipping the Parabola:** Instead of directly applying coordinate transformations, let's think about how the parabola behaves after rotation.\n\n- **Modified Equation:** \n  \\[\n  y = -[(x-2)^2 + 3] = -(x-2)^2 - 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying:**\n  \\[\n  y = -(x-2)^2 - 3\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Does This Make Sense?:** Yes, this represents the parabola opening downwards with the same vertex \\( (2, 3) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Continuing with Translations**\n\n**Step 11: Shifting 3 Units to the Left**\n\n- **Shifting Left:** Replace \\( x \\) with \\( x + 3 \\) to move the parabola left.\n\n- **Updated Equation:**\n  \\[\n  y = -[(x+3-2)^2] - 3 = -(x+1)^2 - 3\n  \\]\n  \n**Checking Work:**\n- **Vertex Check:** \n  - Original vertex: \\( (2, 3) \\)\n  - After left shift: \\( (2 - 3, 3) = (-1, 3) \\)\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Alignment:** The vertex is now correctly shifted to \\( (-1, 3) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Translation: Shifting 2 Units Down**\n\n**Step 12: Shifting Down**\n\n- **Adjusting \\( y \\):** Subtract 2 from the entire equation to move down.\n\n- **Final Equation:**\n  \\[\n  y = -(x+1)^2 - 3 - 2 = -(x+1)^2 - 5\n  \\]\n  \n**Checking Work:**\n- **Vertex Check:** \n  - Original vertex after left shift: \\( (-1, 3) \\)\n  - After moving down: \\( (-1, 3 - 2) = (-1, 1) \\)\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Consistency:** The transformations are consistent, and the vertex is now at \\( (-1, 1) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Reattempting to Find the Zeros**\n\n**Step 13: Solving for Zeros Again**\n\n- **Setting \\( y = 0 \\):**\n  \\[\n  0 = -(x+1)^2 - 5\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solving:**\n  \\[\n  -(x+1)^2 = 5 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (x+1)^2 = -5 \n  \\]\n  \n**Realization:**\n- **Same Issue:** Once again, I'm ending up with \\( (x+1)^2 = -5 \\), which has no real solutions.\n\n**User Prompt Reflecting:**\n- **Confusion:** The problem states that the resulting parabola has zeros, but my calculation leads to no real zeros. This indicates a possible error in my approach.\n\n**Re-evaluating Strategy Again:**\n- **Potential Mistake:** Perhaps the rotation was not handled correctly. Maybe I need to reconsider how the 180-degree rotation affects the parabola's equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting the Rotation Concept Again**\n\n**Step 14: Re-examining the 180-Degree Rotation**\n\n- **Original Thought:** I treated the rotation as simply negating the equation, but that led to no real zeros.\n\n- **Alternative Approach:** Maybe I need to consider that a 180-degree rotation about the vertex flips the parabola both upside down and affects its orientation along the x-axis.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n- **Expressing the Parabola After Rotation:** Instead of negating the entire equation, perhaps I need to adjust both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) components relative to the vertex.\n\n**Step 15: Correcting the Rotation**\n\n- **Flipping the Parabola:** A 180-degree rotation about the vertex can be seen as reflecting the parabola over both axes.\n\n- **Modified Equation Idea:**\n  \\[\n  y = -(x-2)^2 + 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying:**\n  \\[\n  y = -(x-2)^2 + 3\n  \\]\n  \n**Checking Work:**\n- **Vertex Check:** \n  - Original vertex: \\( (2, 3) \\)\n  - After rotation: The vertex remains \\( (2, 3) \\), and the parabola opens downwards.\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Aha Moment:** This seems more accurate. By only negating the quadratic term and adjusting the constant, the parabola opens downwards correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Translations Correctly**\n\n**Step 16: Shifting 3 Units to the Left**\n\n- **Translating Left:** Replace \\( x \\) with \\( x + 3 \\).\n\n- **Updated Equation:**\n  \\[\n  y = -[(x+3)-2]^2 + 3 = -(x+1)^2 + 3\n  \\]\n  \n**Checking Work:**\n- **Vertex Check:** \n  - Original vertex: \\( (2, 3) \\)\n  - After left shift: \\( (2 - 3, 3) = (-1, 3) \\)\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Consistency:** The vertex is now correctly at \\( (-1, 3) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Translation: Shifting 2 Units Down Correctly**\n\n**Step 17: Shifting Down**\n\n- **Adjusting \\( y \\):** Subtract 2 from the entire equation.\n\n- **Final Equation:**\n  \\[\n  y = -(x+1)^2 + 3 - 2 = -(x+1)^2 + 1\n  \\]\n  \n**Checking Work:**\n- **Vertex Check:** \n  - Original vertex after left shift: \\( (-1, 3) \\)\n  - After moving down: \\( (-1, 3 - 2) = (-1, 1) \\)\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **All Set:** The transformations are correct, and the vertex is now at \\( (-1, 1) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Attempt to Find the Zeros**\n\n**Step 18: Solving for Zeros \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)**\n\n- **Setting \\( y = 0 \\):**\n  \\[\n  0 = -(x+1)^2 + 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solving the Equation:**\n  \\[\n  -(x+1)^2 + 1 = 0 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (x+1)^2 = 1 \n  \\]\n  \n- **Finding \\( x \\):**\n  \\[\n  x + 1 = \\pm 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Assigning Zeros:**\n  \\[\n  a = -2, \\quad b = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculating \\( a + b \\):**\n  \\[\n  a + b = -2 + 0 = -2\n  \\]\n  \n**Checking Work:**\n- **Quick Verification:** Plugging \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\) back into the final equation:\n  - For \\( x = 0 \\):\n    \\[\n    y = -(0 + 1)^2 + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0\n    \\]\n  - For \\( x = -2 \\):\n    \\[\n    y = -((-2) + 1)^2 + 1 = -(1)^2 + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0\n    \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Correctness:** The zeros are correct, and the sum \\( a + b = -2 \\) matches our calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Initial Approach:** Attempted to rotate the parabola by negating the entire equation, which led to no real zeros. Realized that the rotation was not handled correctly.\n\n- **Correction:** Adjusted the rotation by only negating the quadratic term and maintaining the constant term, ensuring the parabola opened downwards correctly.\n\n- **Translations:** Successfully applied left and downward shifts to the parabola.\n\n- **Final Solution:** Solved for the zeros of the transformed parabola and computed \\( a + b = -2 \\).\n\n<ANSWER> solution: -2 </ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**Final Check:**\n  \n- **Verification:** All steps align with the intended transformations, and the final zeros satisfy the transformed equation.\n  \n- **Confidence:** The solution is now correct after re-evaluating and correcting the initial approach.\n\n---\n\n**Alright, that wraps it up!** By carefully re-examining each transformation step, especially the rotation, I ensured that the final solution accurately reflects the problem's requirements.",
  "ground_truth": "The graph of the original parabola ($A$) and its final image ($A'$) after rotation and translation is shown below:\n\n[asy]\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(4);\n\nxaxis(-3,4,Ticks(f, 2.0));\n\nyaxis(-3,7,Ticks(f, 2.0));\nreal f(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn (x-2)^2+3;\n\n}\n\ndraw(\"$A$\", graph(f,0,4), linewidth(1));\nreal g(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn -(x+1)^2+1;\n\n}\n\ndraw(\"$A'$\", graph(g,-3,1), linewidth(1));\n[/asy]\n\nRotating the original parabola 180 degrees changes its equation to $y=-(x-2)^2+3$. Shifting this last parabola to the left changes its equation to $y=-(x+1)^2+3$. Shifting it down changes its equation to $y=-(x+1)^2+1$. So the equation of $A'$ is $y=-(x+1)^2+1$. To find the zeros of this parabola, we set $y=0$ to get $0=-(x+1)^2+1$. Expanding the right hand side gives $0=-x^2-2x$. Dividing through by $-1$ and factoring out an $x$ from the right hand side, we get $0=x(x+2)$, so either $x=0$ or $x+2=0$. Thus, $a=0$ and $b=-2$, so $a+b=\\boxed{-2}$."
