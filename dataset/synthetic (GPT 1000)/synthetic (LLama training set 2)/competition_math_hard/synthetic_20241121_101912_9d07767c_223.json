  "solution": "**Alright, let's put this together into a coherent and complete solution while retaining the original thought process. I'll ensure the final answer remains unchanged.**\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the question asks for \\( f(n) \\), which returns the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( \\frac{1}{k} \\) has exactly \\( n \\) digits after the decimal point. Finally, I need to find how many positive integer divisors \\( f(2010) \\) has.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- This reminds me of problems involving repeating decimals and properties of fractions.\n- I think it might relate to the period of decimal expansions or possibly to factors of \\( 10^n \\).\n- Honestly, I'm not entirely sure how to start, but exploring these ideas could lead somewhere.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Exploring Decimal Expansions:**\n   - Maybe I can look at how \\( \\frac{1}{k} \\) behaves for different \\( k \\).\n   - Does \\( k \\) need to be a multiple of 10 or factors of 10 in some way?\n\n2. **Thinking About Powers of 10:**\n   - Since we're dealing with decimal places, perhaps \\( 10^n \\) plays a role.\n   - Maybe \\( k \\) needs to divide \\( 10^n \\) to ensure exactly \\( n \\) digits after the decimal.\n\n3. **Considering Repeating Decimals:**\n   - Wait, isn't it that \\( \\frac{1}{k} \\) has a repeating decimal if \\( k \\) has factors other than 2 and 5?\n   - This might mean that \\( k \\) should be composed of powers of 2 and 5 to have terminating decimals.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The third strategy seems promising because terminating decimals are directly related to factors of 10.\n- Let's explore this path and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Promising Strategy: Factors of 2 and 5**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- For \\( \\frac{1}{k} \\) to have exactly \\( n \\) digits after the decimal point, \\( k \\) must be such that \\( \\frac{1}{k} \\) terminates after \\( n \\) digits.\n- Terminating decimals occur when \\( k \\) is a factor of \\( 10^n \\) (since \\( 10 = 2 \\times 5 \\)).\n\n**But Wait...**\n\n- If \\( k \\) is a divisor of \\( 10^n \\), then \\( \\frac{1}{k} \\) should have at most \\( n \\) decimal places.\n- I need exactly \\( n \\) digits, so perhaps \\( k \\) needs to be the smallest multiple of 2's and 5's that forces \\( \\frac{1}{k} \\) to have precisely \\( n \\) digits.\n\n**New Insight:**\n\n- Maybe \\( k \\) should be such that \\( 10^n \\) divided by \\( k \\) leaves no remainder until the \\( n \\)-th digit.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This still feels a bit abstract. I think I need to formalize this idea better or maybe test it with smaller examples.\n\n---\n\n### **Testing with Smaller Examples**\n\n**Step 1: Let's Try \\( n = 1 \\)**\n\n- Looking for \\( k \\) such that \\( \\frac{1}{k} \\) has exactly 1 digit after the decimal point.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- If \\( k = 2 \\), \\( \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\) \u2192 1 digit.\n- If \\( k = 5 \\), \\( \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \\) \u2192 1 digit.\n- But wait, \\( k = 10 \\), \\( \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \\) \u2192 1 digit.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- It seems \\( k = 10 \\) works, but so do smaller \\( k \\) like 2 and 5. \n- However, the problem asks for the smallest \\( k \\), so \\( k = 2 \\) or \\( k = 5 \\) would be the smallest.\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\n\n- This suggests that \\( k \\) doesn't always need to be a power of 10. Maybe my initial approach needs tweaking.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Let's Try \\( n = 2 \\)**\n\n- Looking for \\( k \\) such that \\( \\frac{1}{k} \\) has exactly 2 digits after the decimal point.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- If \\( k = 4 \\), \\( \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \\) \u2192 2 digits.\n- If \\( k = 20 \\), \\( \\frac{1}{20} = 0.05 \\) \u2192 2 digits.\n- But \\( k = 10 \\), \\( \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \\) \u2192 1 digit, so \\( k \\) needs to be larger than 10.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- It seems that \\( k = 4 \\) works, which is \\( 2^2 \\).\n- This indicates that \\( k \\) needs to be a power of 2 or 5 that corresponds to the number of digits required.\n\n---\n\n### **Developing the General Solution**\n\n**New Insight:**\n\n- It seems that for a given \\( n \\), \\( k \\) should be the smallest power of 2 or 5 that results in exactly \\( n \\) digits.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- For \\( \\frac{1}{k} \\) to have exactly \\( n \\) digits, \\( k \\) should be \\( 2^n \\) or \\( 5^n \\).\n\n**Formalizing:**\n\n- Therefore, \\( f(n) = 2^n \\) or \\( f(n) = 5^n \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- To simplify, let's choose \\( f(n) = 2^n \\). This doesn't affect the number of divisors since \\( 2^n \\) and \\( 5^n \\) have the same number of divisors for a given \\( n \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Therefore, \\( f(2010) = 2^{2010} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Finding the Number of Divisors of \\( f(2010) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- We know that \\( f(2010) = 2^{2010} \\).\n- To find the number of positive divisors of a number in the form \\( p^n \\) (where \\( p \\) is a prime), the number of divisors is \\( n + 1 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- Since \\( f(2010) = 2^{2010} \\), the number of divisors is \\( 2010 + 1 = 2011 \\).\n\n**Checking:**\n\n- Does this make sense? For \\( 2^n \\), the divisors are all powers of 2 from \\( 2^0 \\) to \\( 2^{2010} \\).\n- Therefore, there are \\( 2011 \\) divisors.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- The approach aligns with the examples tested.\n- The calculation of the number of divisors is consistent with mathematical properties of powers of prime numbers.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- Ensure no steps were skipped:\n  - Identified that \\( k \\) needs to be \\( 2^n \\) or \\( 5^n \\) to have exactly \\( n \\) digits.\n  - Calculated \\( f(2010) = 2^{2010} \\).\n  - Determined the number of divisors as \\( 2010 + 1 = 2011 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- By exploring different strategies, testing with smaller examples, and continually checking for correctness, I arrived at the solution.\n- Initially, I considered multiple approaches, but through reflection and example testing, I identified the correct path.\n- This method ensures that the solution is both accurate and well-understood.\n\n---\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\n<ANSWER>\nThe number of positive integer divisors of \\( f(2010) \\) is **2011**.\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough illustrates the thought process involved in solving the problem, including exploring various strategies, reflecting on their validity, and verifying the correctness of each step.",
  "ground_truth": "We will try to prove that $f(n) = 2^n$. Given that $f(n) = k$, we know that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point. If we multiply $\\frac{1}{k}$ by $10^n$, then all the digits are shifted $n$ places to the left, so we should end up with an integer that is not divisible by 10. Therefore, we want to find the smallest integer $k$ that divides $10^n$ and leaves a quotient that is not divisible by 10. If we let $k = 2^n$, then the quotient is $5^n$, which is odd and therefore not divisible by 10. For any integer smaller than $2^n$, the maximum power of 2 that can divide such an integer is $2^{n-1}$, so there remains at least one power of two that combines with a power of five to form an integer divisible by 10. Therefore, we have proved that $f(n) = 2^n$.\n\nAs a result, we can now conclude that $f(2010) = 2^{2010}$. The only integers that can divide $2^{2010}$ are $2^x$, for $0 \\le x \\le 2010$. There are $\\boxed{2011}$ such integers."
