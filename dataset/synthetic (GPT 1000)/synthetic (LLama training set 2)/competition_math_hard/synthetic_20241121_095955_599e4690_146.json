  "problem": "Two cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that both cards are numbers (2 through 10) totaling to 12?",
  "solution": "Sure, let's assemble the solution into a coherent step-by-step process while retaining the original thought flow. I'll maintain the structure of brainstorming, exploring strategies, reflecting, and double-checking to ensure clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem Statement**\n\nCompute the probability that two cards drawn from a standard 52-card deck are numbered cards (2 through 10) that total to 12.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis problem reminds me of probability questions involving card combinations. I know that a standard deck has numbered cards from 2 to 10 across four suits. My instinct is to consider all possible pairs that add up to 12, but I'm uncertain about how to account for the different suits.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **List All Combinations:** Enumerate all card pairs that sum to 12 and calculate the total number of favorable outcomes.\n2. **Use Probability Formulas:** Compute the probability of drawing two specific cards that add up to 12 using combinatorial methods.\n3. **Consider Suit Combinations:** Since each card has four suits, incorporate this into the calculations to account for multiple possibilities.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nListing all combinations seems straightforward but might become complex when suits are involved. Using probability formulas could be more efficient. I think exploring both strategies will help determine the best approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: List All Combinations**\n\n**Step 1: Identify All Pairs of Numbered Cards Totaling 12**\n\n**Thinking:**  \nThe numbered cards from 2 to 10 can pair up to make 12. Let's list those pairs:\n\n- 2 + 10\n- 3 + 9\n- 4 + 8\n- 5 + 7\n- 6 + 6\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe pair 6 + 6 is unique because both cards are the same number, unlike the other pairs where the numbers are different. This requires special attention because there are multiple ways to draw two sixes from the four available.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the Suits for Each Pair**\n\n**Thinking:**  \nEach card is available in four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades). Therefore, for each pair, there are multiple combinations based on the suits.\n\n- **For Distinct Pairs (e.g., 2 + 10):**\n  - Each card has 4 suits, so there are \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) combinations per pair.\n\n- **For the 6 + 6 Pair:**\n  - Since both cards are sixes, we need to choose 2 suits out of the 4 available. This can be calculated using combinations: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Distinct Pairs:**  \n  - 4 pairs \u00d7 16 combinations each = 64 combinations\n- **6 + 6 Pair:**  \n  - 6 combinations\n\n**Total Favorable Combinations:**  \n\\[ 64 + 6 = 70 \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nTo verify, let's list a few combinations:\n\n- 2 of Hearts + 10 of Spades\n- 2 of Diamonds + 10 of Clubs\n- 6 of Hearts + 6 of Diamonds, etc.\n\nThis seems correct, so the total number of favorable combinations is 70.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Use Probability Formulas**\n\n**Thinking:**  \nInstead of listing all combinations, I can calculate the probability directly by considering the total number of ways to draw two cards and the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Total Number of Ways to Draw Two Cards**\n\n**Calculation:**  \nThe total number of ways to draw any two cards from a 52-card deck is given by combinations:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{52}{2} = \\frac{52 \\times 51}{2} = 1,326\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Probability Using Favorable Combinations**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Favorable Combinations}}{\\text{Total Combinations}} = \\frac{70}{1,326}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{70}{1,326} = \\frac{35}{663} \\approx 0.0528\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis probability translates to approximately a 5.28% chance, which seems reasonable given the specific conditions required. However, to ensure accuracy, let's double-check this approach by considering the probability of drawing each specific pair.\n\n---\n\n### **Double-Checking the Approach**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nIt's essential to verify the solution by examining the probability of drawing each pair separately to confirm that no mistakes were made in the initial calculation.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Probability for Each Distinct Pair**\n\n- **For Distinct Pairs (e.g., 2 + 10):**\n  - Probability of drawing a 2: \\(\\frac{4}{52}\\) (since there are 4 twos in the deck)\n  - Probability of drawing a 10 given a 2 was drawn: \\(\\frac{4}{51}\\) (since one card has already been drawn)\n  - Multiply by 2 to account for both possible orders (2 + 10 or 10 + 2):\n\n\\[\n2 \\times \\frac{4}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{32}{2,652} = \\frac{16}{1,326}\n\\]\n\n- **Number of Distinct Pairs:** 4\n\n\\[\n4 \\times \\frac{16}{1,326} = \\frac{64}{1,326}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Probability for the 6 + 6 Pair**\n\n- Probability of drawing a 6: \\(\\frac{4}{52}\\)\n- Probability of drawing another 6: \\(\\frac{3}{51}\\) (since one six has already been drawn)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{12}{2,652} = \\frac{6}{1,326}\n\\]\n\n**Total Probability:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{64}{1,326} + \\frac{6}{1,326} = \\frac{70}{1,326} = \\frac{35}{663} \\approx 0.0528\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth methods\u2014the first strategy of listing combinations and the second strategy of calculating probabilities\u2014yield the same result. This consistency reinforces the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Does This Make Sense?**\n\n**Intuition:**  \nA probability of approximately 5.28% feels plausible for such a specific event in a deck of cards. Given the numerous possible combinations and the precise sums required, this probability aligns with expectations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAfter thoroughly exploring and verifying multiple strategies, the probability that two cards drawn are numbered cards totaling to 12 is approximately 5.28%.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\\(\\frac{35}{663} \\approx 0.0528\\)  \nSo, the probability is approximately 5.28%.\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy systematically brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and double-checking the calculations through multiple methods, I ensured the accuracy of the solution. This thorough approach not only provided the correct answer but also deepened the understanding of probability concepts related to card games. Checking the work through various strategies confirmed the correctness and validity of the final probability.\n\n---\n\nI hope this format effectively integrates all the working-out steps into a complete, coherent solution while preserving the original thought process.",
  "ground_truth": "There are two cases that we have to consider.\n\n$\\bullet~$ Case 1: The first card is one of 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n\nThere are 32 such cards, so this occurs with probability $\\dfrac{32}{52}$.  For any of these cards, there are 4 cards left in the deck such that the cards sum to 12, so the probability of drawing one is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  Thus, the probability that this case occurs is $\\dfrac{32}{52}\\times\\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{32}{663}$.\n\n$\\bullet~$ Case 2: The first card is a 6.\n\nThere are 4 of these, so this occurs with probability $\\dfrac{4}{52}$.  Now we need to draw another 6.  There are only 3 left in the deck, so the probability of drawing one is $\\dfrac{3}{51}$.  Thus, the probability that this case occurs is $\\dfrac{4}{52}\\times\\dfrac{3}{51} = \\dfrac{3}{663}$.\n\nTherefore the overall probability is $\\dfrac{32}{663} + \\dfrac{3}{663} = \\boxed{\\frac{35}{663}}. $"
