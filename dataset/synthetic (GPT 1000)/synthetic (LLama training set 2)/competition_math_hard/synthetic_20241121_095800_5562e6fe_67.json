  "solution": "Absolutely, let's put everything together into a polished, coherent solution while preserving the original thought process. I'll maintain the natural flow of brainstorming, reflecting, and verifying to ensure the solution remains authentic and thorough.\n\n---\n\n### **<START> Understanding the Question</START>**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- We have two geometric sequences: \\(k, a_2, a_3\\) and \\(k, b_2, b_3\\), each with **different common ratios**.\n- There's a condition given: \n  \\[\n  a_3 - b_3 = 2(a_2 - b_2)\n  \\]\n- **<BRAINSTORM> Wait a minute</BRAINSTORM>**, we're asked to find the **sum of the common ratios** of the two sequences. **Hmm**, geometric sequences rely on a starting term and a common ratio to generate subsequent terms.\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n- Perhaps I can express each term in terms of the first term and their respective common ratios.\n- **<EXPLORING STRATEGIES> Maybe</EXPLORING STRATEGIES>** setting up equations for these terms will help me relate the common ratios.\n\n**Reflecting:**\n- **<WAIT> But wait</WAIT>**, since the common ratios are different, I'll need to assign distinct variables to them. This approach seems logical and aligns with the properties of geometric sequences.\n\n---\n\n### **<STEP 1> Expressing Terms Using Common Ratios</STEP 1>**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let\u2019s assign variables to the common ratios to make calculations easier.\n- Suppose the common ratio for the first sequence is \\(r\\) and for the second sequence is \\(s\\).\n\n**Writing It Out:**\n- For the **first sequence**: \n  \\[\n  a_2 = kr,\\quad a_3 = kr^2\n  \\]\n- For the **second sequence**:\n  \\[\n  b_2 = ks,\\quad b_3 = ks^2\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **<SELF-CHECK> Does this make sense?</SELF-CHECK>** Yes, because each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by the common ratio.\n- **<QUICK CHECK> Interesting</QUICK CHECK>**, since \\(k\\) is the first term in both sequences, it might simplify the equation later.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- If \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) are different, the sequences have distinct growth rates. **<CONFIRMING> This aligns</CONFIRMING>** with the problem\u2019s conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **<STEP 2> Substituting Into the Given Equation</STEP 2>**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **<ALRIGHT> Alright</ALRIGHT>**, let's plug the expressions for \\(a_3, b_3, a_2,\\) and \\(b_2\\) into the given condition:\n  \\[\n  a_3 - b_3 = 2(a_2 - b_2)\n  \\]\n  \n**Writing It Out:**\n\\[\nkr^2 - ks^2 = 2(kr - ks)\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n- Factor out \\(k\\) from both sides:\n  \\[\n  k(r^2 - s^2) = 2k(r - s)\n  \\]\n- **<WAIT> Wait</WAIT>**, since \\(k\\) is non-zero (otherwise, the sequences would be trivial), I can divide both sides by \\(k\\):\n  \\[\n  r^2 - s^2 = 2(r - s)\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **<HMM> Hmm</HMM>**, this resembles a quadratic equation involving \\(r\\) and \\(s\\). **<MAYBE> Maybe</MAYBE>** I can factor it further.\n\n**Is there a familiar pattern?**\n- Yes, \\(r^2 - s^2\\) is a difference of squares. **<LET'S SEE> Let's see</LET'S SEE>** if that helps.\n\n---\n\n### **<STEP 3> Factoring the Equation</STEP 3>**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Recognizing that \\(r^2 - s^2\\) can be factored as \\((r - s)(r + s)\\).\n- **<WAIT> Wait</WAIT>**, the right side is already \\(2(r - s)\\). **<THIS MIGHT> This might</THIS MIGHT>** allow me to cancel out terms.\n\n**Writing It Out:**\n\\[\n(r - s)(r + s) = 2(r - s)\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n- **<ASSUMING> Assuming</ASSUMING>** \\(r - s \\neq 0\\) (since the common ratios are different), I can divide both sides by \\(r - s\\):\n  \\[\n  r + s = 2\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **<SELF-CHECK> Does this result make sense?</SELF-CHECK>** Yes, it provides a straightforward relationship between the common ratios \\(r\\) and \\(s\\).\n- **<QUICK CHECK> Quick Check:</QUICK CHECK>** If \\(r + s = 2\\) and \\(r \\neq s\\), it satisfies the condition of having different common ratios.\n\n---\n\n### **<STEP 4> Verifying the Solution</STEP 4>**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **<BEFORE FINALIZING> Before finalizing</BEFORE FINALIZING>**, let's verify whether \\(r + s = 2\\) satisfies the original condition.\n- **<SUBSTITUTING BACK> Substituting back</SUBSTITUTING BACK>** into the equation to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\n**Writing It Out:**\n- Given:\n  \\[\n  r^2 - s^2 = 2(r - s)\n  \\]\n- **<SUBSTITUTING> Substituting</SUBSTITUTING>** \\(r + s = 2\\):\n  - Left Side: \n    \\[\n    r^2 - s^2 = (r - s)(r + s) = (r - s)(2)\n    \\]\n  - Right Side: \n    \\[\n    2(r - s)\n    \\]\n- **<COMPARISON> Comparison:</COMPARISON>**\n  \\[\n  (r - s)(2) = 2(r - s)\n  \\]\n  Which holds true.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **<CONFIRMING> Everything checks out</CONFIRMING>**, so \\(r + s = 2\\) is indeed the correct relationship.\n- **<FINAL CHECK> Final Check:</FINAL CHECK>** The sum of the common ratios is 2, which satisfies the given condition without any contradictions.\n\n---\n\n### **<CONCLUSION> Conclusion</CONCLUSION>**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n- After expressing the terms, substituting into the given equation, and simplifying, we've found that the **sum of the common ratios** is:\n  \\[\n  r + s = 2\n  \\]\n- **<ALL STEPS VALIDATE> All steps validate</ALL STEPS VALIDATE>** the correctness of this solution.\n\n**<ANSWER>solution - The sum of the common ratios is \\(2\\).</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **<FINAL REFLECTION> Final Reflection</FINAL REFLECTION>**\n\n- **<ALIGNMENT CHECK> Does the solution align with the problem's conditions?</ALIGNMENT CHECK>** Yes, both geometric sequences have different common ratios whose sum is 2, satisfying the given equation.\n- **<WERE THERE ANY ALTERNATE STRATEGIES?> Were there any alternate strategies?</WERE THERE ANY ALTERNATE STRATEGIES?>** Initially, expressing terms directly was the primary approach. **<IF NEEDED> If this hadn't worked</IF NEEDED>**, exploring patterns or leveraging properties of geometric sequences might have been necessary.\n- **<ANY UNEXPECTED CHALLENGES?> Any unexpected challenges?</ANY UNEXPECTED CHALLENGES?>** Not particularly; the straightforward factoring and simplification led directly to the solution.\n\nBy thoroughly exploring and reflecting at each step, I've ensured that the solution is both correct and complete.",
  "ground_truth": "Let the common ratio of the first sequence be $p$ and the common ratio of the second sequence be $r$.  Then the equation becomes\n\n$$kp^2-kr^2=2(kp-kr)$$Dividing both sides by $k$ (since the sequences are nonconstant, no term can be $0$), we get\n\n$$p^2-r^2=2(p-r)$$The left side factors as $(p-r)(p+r)$.  Since $p\\neq r$, we can divide by $p-r$ to get\n\n$$p+r=\\boxed{2}$$"
