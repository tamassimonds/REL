    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem again. I need to find the largest number with all different digits whose sum equals 16. My previous attempt led me to 961, but it seems that was incorrect. Let me walk through my thought process, identify where I went wrong, and adjust my approach accordingly.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, I need a number where:\n1. All digits are unique.\n2. The sum of the digits is exactly 16.\n\nInitially, I thought of maximizing the number by starting with the largest digits, but clearly, that didn't yield the correct answer. Let me brainstorm some strategies again.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Greedy Approach:**  \n   Start with the largest digits possible to maximize the number's value.\n\n2. **Systematic Listing:**  \n   List all combinations of digits adding up to 16 and pick the largest number.\n\n3. **Alternative Approach:**  \n   Use smaller digits to allow for more digits in the number, potentially increasing its magnitude.\n\nHmm, perhaps focusing only on large digits constrained the number's length, limiting its size. Maybe I need to consider using more digits with smaller values to maximize the overall number.\n\n### **Revisiting the Greedy Approach**\n\nLet me reflect on my previous steps:\n\n1. **Chosen Digits:**  \n   I started with 9 and 7, creating the number 97.  \n   **Total Sum:** 9 + 7 = 16  \n   \n   Wait a minute, using only two digits might not be optimal. Larger numbers can have more digits, which might increase the number's magnitude even if individual digits are smaller.\n\n2. **Expanding to Three Digits:**  \n   Then I tried 961:  \n   **Total Sum:** 9 + 6 + 1 = 16  \n   \n   But the marker indicated that this isn't the largest possible number. Perhaps I need to think differently.\n\n### **Exploring an Alternative Strategy**\n\nMaybe instead of starting with the largest digits, I should focus on using more digits to construct a larger number. This reminds me of the idea that having more digits, even if they are smaller, can create a larger number overall.\n\n**Let\u2019s try this approach:**\n\n1. **Start with Smaller Digits to Allow More Places:**  \n   By using smaller digits, I can have more unique digits adding up to 16. This might allow me to create a larger number with more digits.\n\n### **Implementing the Alternative Strategy**\n\n**Step 1: List Smallest Digits Adding Up to 16**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the smallest unique digits and see how many I can use to sum up to 16.\n\n- **Digits:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  \n  But I can only use each digit once.\n\n**Step 2: Begin Adding from the Smallest Digit**\n\n- 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10  \n  **Remaining Sum Needed:** 16 - 10 = 6  \n\n**Step 3: Add the Next Largest Possible Digit**\n\n- Adding 5 would make the sum 15, leaving only 1 needed, but I\u2019ve already used 1.  \n  Hmm, I need to adjust.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, if I can\u2019t use 5 without repeating digits, I should look for another combination.\n\n**Adjustment:**  \nInstead of adding 5, I\u2019ll skip to a higher digit that doesn\u2019t repeat.\n\n- **Digits so far:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4  \n- **Need to add:** 16 - 10 = 6  \n\nSo, I can add 6 to complete the sum.\n\n**Step 4: Final Set of Digits**\n\n- **Digits Used:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6  \n- **Total Sum:** 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16  \n\n**Current Number:**  \nBy arranging these digits in descending order to maximize the number:  \n**Number:** 643210  \n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\n- **Sum of Digits:** 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 16  \n- **All Digits Unique:** Yes  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis approach seems better. By utilizing more digits, the number becomes significantly larger than my previous attempts. \n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nAfter re-evaluating my strategy and focusing on maximizing the number of digits while maintaining the required sum, I arrived at a much larger number.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe largest number, with all different digits adding up to 16, is **643210**.\n\n### **Lesson Learned**\n\nInitially, focusing solely on large digits limited the number's length. By considering more digits with smaller values, I could construct a much larger number. It's essential to balance the digit size with the number of digits to maximize the overall value.",

  "ground_truth": "For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible. To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$."
