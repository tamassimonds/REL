  "solution": "Certainly! Let\u2019s streamline the original work into a coherent and complete solution while preserving the natural thought process and reflections. Here\u2019s how it would look:\n\n---\n\n## **Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. The question asks us to find the greatest of the three common positive divisors shared by the numbers \\(90\\) and \\(m\\), where they have exactly three common divisors.\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \n- This reminds me of problems involving common divisors and prime factorization.  \n- I think we'll need to explore the properties of numbers with a specific number of divisors.  \n- Maybe considering the greatest common divisor (GCD) could be useful.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**  \n- Should I find the prime factors of \\(90\\) first?  \n- How does \\(m\\) relate to \\(90\\) in terms of divisibility?  \n- Perhaps \\(m\\) shares some prime factors with \\(90\\).  \n\n**Possible Strategies:**  \n1. **Prime Factorization:** Breaking down \\(90\\) to see its divisors.  \n2. **Understanding Number of Divisors:** Figuring out how a number can have exactly three divisors.  \n3. **Exploring \\(m\\):** Determining what \\(m\\) must be to share exactly three divisors with \\(90\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Prime Factorization of 90**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's start by finding the prime factors of \\(90\\) to understand its divisors. Knowing the factors will help identify the common divisors with \\(m\\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- \\(90\\) is even, so divide by \\(2\\):  \n  \\[90 \\div 2 = 45\\]  \n- \\(45\\) is divisible by \\(3\\):  \n  \\[45 \\div 3 = 15\\]  \n- \\(15\\) is divisible by \\(3\\):  \n  \\[15 \\div 3 = 5\\]  \n- \\(5\\) is a prime number.  \n\nSo, the prime factorization of \\(90\\) is:  \n\\[\n90 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks correct. We've broken \\(90\\) down into its prime components.  \n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\)  \n- \\(6 \\times 3 = 18\\)  \n- \\(18 \\times 5 = 90\\)  \nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Listing the Divisors of 90**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, let's list all the divisors of \\(90\\) to see what common divisors it might share with \\(m\\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \nUsing the prime factors, the divisors are combinations of these factors:  \n\\[\n90 = 2^a \\times 3^b \\times 5^c\n\\]  \nwhere \\(a = 0 \\text{ or } 1\\), \\(b = 0, 1, \\text{ or } 2\\), \\(c = 0 \\text{ or } 1\\).\n\nListing them out:  \n- \\(1\\)  \n- \\(2\\)  \n- \\(3\\)  \n- \\(5\\)  \n- \\(6\\)  \n- \\(9\\)  \n- \\(10\\)  \n- \\(15\\)  \n- \\(18\\)  \n- \\(30\\)  \n- \\(45\\)  \n- \\(90\\)  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nThese are all the divisors of \\(90\\).  \n\n**Quick Check:**  \nCounting them, there are \\(12\\) divisors, which matches the expected number from the formula:  \n\\((1+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 12\\).\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Understanding the Condition of Exactly Three Common Divisors**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe problem states that \\(90\\) and \\(m\\) share exactly three positive divisors. This is a crucial hint.  \n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- What kind of numbers have exactly three divisors?  \n- Typically, numbers with exactly three divisors are squares of prime numbers because:  \n  \\((\\text{prime})^2\\) has divisors: \\(1\\), the prime itself, and its square.  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute... If both \\(90\\) and \\(m\\) share exactly three divisors, could it be that their common divisors include such primes?\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nPerhaps \\(m\\) is constructed in a way that it shares specific prime factors of \\(90\\) raised to certain powers.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Exploring Possible Values of \\(m\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo have exactly three common divisors, \\(m\\) must be related to \\(90\\) in a specific way.  \n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- Maybe \\(m\\) is a multiple of some of \\(90\\)\u2019s prime factors.  \n- Which combinations would result in exactly three common divisors?\n\n**Possible Scenarios:**  \n1. **\\(m\\) is a power of a prime factor of \\(90\\):**  \n   - For example, \\(m = 3^2\\), which has divisors \\(1\\), \\(3\\), and \\(9\\).\n\n2. **\\(m\\) is a product of different prime factors of \\(90\\):**  \n   - For example, \\(m = 2 \\times 3\\), which has divisors \\(1\\), \\(2\\), and \\(3\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLet's test these scenarios to see which one fits.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Testing Scenario 1 - \\(m\\) as a Power of a Prime Factor**\n\n**Example:**  \nLet\u2019s try \\(m = 3^2 = 9\\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- Divisors of \\(9\\): \\(1, 3, 9\\)  \n- Common divisors with \\(90\\): \\(1, 3, 9\\)  \n\n**Total Common Divisors:**  \nExactly three: \\(1, 3, 9\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis scenario works! \\(m = 9\\) shares exactly three divisors with \\(90\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- Does \\(9\\) divide \\(90\\)? Yes.  \n- Are there any other common divisors? No, only \\(1, 3, 9\\).\n\n**WAIT!**  \nBut the greatest common divisor here is \\(9\\), which is less than \\(90\\).\n\n**Realization:**  \nHmm, since the question asks for the greatest of these three common divisors, and we've found \\(9\\), maybe there's a better approach to confirm this is indeed the greatest.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Confirming the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo ensure we've identified the greatest common divisor, let's revisit our approach and confirm that \\(9\\) is indeed the greatest of the three common divisors.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nPerhaps considering the GCD of \\(90\\) and \\(m\\) could provide clarity.\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- If \\(m = 9\\), then:  \n  \\(\\text{GCD}(90, 9) = 9\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis confirms that \\(9\\) is the greatest common divisor when \\(m = 9\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- No larger divisor is common between \\(90\\) and \\(9\\) other than \\(9\\) itself.  \n\n**Alternative Strategy:**  \nBut wait, is there another value of \\(m\\) that still results in exactly three common divisors with a greater GCD?\n\n**Second Thoughts:**  \nMaybe we need to explore other combinations to ensure we've captured the greatest possible GCD.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 7: Exploring Scenario 2 - \\(m\\) as a Product of Different Prime Factors**\n\n**Example:**  \nLet\u2019s try \\(m = 2 \\times 3 = 6\\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- Divisors of \\(6\\): \\(1, 2, 3, 6\\)  \n- Common divisors with \\(90\\): \\(1, 2, 3, 6\\)  \n\n**Total Common Divisors:**  \nFour: \\(1, 2, 3, 6\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis doesn't fit the condition of exactly three common divisors.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScenario 2 doesn't work because there are more than three common divisors.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 8: Validating Scenario 1 with Other Prime Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's ensure that \\(m = 9\\) is the only valid case by testing other similar \\(m\\) values.\n\n**Example:**  \nLet\u2019s try \\(m = 5\\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- Divisors of \\(5\\): \\(1, 5\\)  \n- Common divisors with \\(90\\): \\(1, 5\\)  \n\n**Total Common Divisors:**  \nOnly two: \\(1, 5\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis doesn't meet the requirement of exactly three common divisors.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOnly \\(m = 9\\) satisfies the condition.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Check: Is \\(9\\) the Greatest Common Divisor?**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, let's ensure no other value of \\(m\\) could lead to a greater common divisor while still maintaining exactly three common divisors.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nGiven that \\(m = 9\\) leads to exactly three common divisors \\(1, 3, 9\\), and any other \\(m\\) either increases the number of common divisors or decreases the greatest common divisor, \\(9\\) must be the greatest.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- No larger divisor than \\(9\\) is common to both \\(90\\) and any valid \\(m\\) with exactly three common divisors.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and validating our approach, we've determined that the greatest of the three common divisors shared by \\(90\\) and \\(m\\) is:  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]]",
  "ground_truth": "Recall that the common divisors of two integers are precisely the divisors of the greatest common divisor. So, for two numbers to have exactly three positive divisors in common, those divisors must be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$ such that $p$ is prime. We now look at the prime factorization of $90$: $90=2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. Since $3^2$ is the only perfect square divisor of $90$, the divisors that $90$ and $m$ share must be $1$, $3$, and $9$. The largest of these three numbers is $\\boxed{9}$."
