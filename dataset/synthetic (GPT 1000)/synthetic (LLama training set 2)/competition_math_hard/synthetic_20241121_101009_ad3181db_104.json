  "problem": "How many integers $n$ satisfy the inequality $-8\\pi\\le n\\le10\\pi$?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were working it out on paper, complete with brainstorming, checking for correctness, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question is asking how many integers \\( n \\) satisfy the inequality \\( -8\\pi \\leq n \\leq 10\\pi \\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a problem involving inequalities and \u03c0 (pi). Since \u03c0 is approximately 3.14159, I think converting the bounds involving \u03c0 to numerical values would make it easier to handle.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Convert the Inequality to Numerical Bounds:** Calculate \\( -8\\pi \\) and \\( 10\\pi \\) numerically and then find all integers within that range.\n  2. **Consider the Properties of Integers:** Think about how integers behave within continuous ranges.\n  3. **Alternative Approach:** Maybe there's a way to determine the number of integers without explicitly listing them.\n\n- **Reflection:** Converting to numerical bounds seems straightforward, but I need to ensure that I capture all integers within the range correctly. Let\u2019s start with this approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Converting the Inequality to Numerical Bounds**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To make the inequality more tangible, I'll calculate the numerical values of \\( -8\\pi \\) and \\( 10\\pi \\).\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  -8\\pi \\approx -8 \\times 3.14159 \\approx -25.13272\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  10\\pi \\approx 10 \\times 3.14159 \\approx 31.4159\n  \\]\n  \n- **So, the inequality becomes:**\n  \\[\n  -25.13272 \\leq n \\leq 31.4159\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, by converting to numerical values, I can easily visualize the range in which \\( n \\) must lie.\n\n- **Next Step:** Now, I need to find all integers \\( n \\) within this numerical range.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Integer Boundaries**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I need to determine the smallest and largest integers within the calculated bounds.\n\n- **Finding the Lower Bound:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{The smallest integer } n \\geq -25.13272 \\text{ is } n = -25\n  \\]\n  \n  - **Check:** \\( -25 \\geq -25.13272 \\) is true.\n  \n- **Finding the Upper Bound:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{The largest integer } n \\leq 31.4159 \\text{ is } n = 31\n  \\]\n  \n  - **Check:** \\( 31 \\leq 31.4159 \\) is true.\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, selecting \\( n = -25 \\) and \\( n = 31 \\) ensures that all integers \\( n \\) within the range are included.\n\n- **Next Step:** Confirm that all integers between these bounds are valid and count them.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Counting the Integers Within the Range**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the total number of integers \\( n \\) from \\( -25 \\) to \\( 31 \\) inclusive, I can use the formula:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total integers} = (\\text{Upper bound}) - (\\text{Lower bound}) + 1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  31 - (-25) + 1 = 31 + 25 + 1 = 57\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Adding 25 to 31 gives 56, and adding 1 accounts for inclusivity, resulting in 57. This seems correct.\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, the calculation logically accounts for all integers within the specified range.\n\n- **Answer:** There are 57 integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the inequality \\( -8\\pi \\leq n \\leq 10\\pi \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I want to ensure that no integers are missed or extra within the calculated range.\n\n- **Consider an Alternative Strategy:**  \n  Perhaps listing a few integers at both ends to double-check.\n\n- **Lower End Check:**  \n  \\( n = -25 \\Rightarrow -25 \\geq -25.13272 \\)  \n  \\( n = -26 \\Rightarrow -26 < -25.13272 \\) (which is outside the range)\n  \n- **Upper End Check:**  \n  \\( n = 31 \\Rightarrow 31 \\leq 31.4159 \\)  \n  \\( n = 32 \\Rightarrow 32 > 31.4159 \\) (which is outside the range)\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, only integers from \\( -25 \\) to \\( 31 \\) inclusive satisfy the inequality. No integers are missed or extra.\n\n- **Final Confirmation:** The solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n- **<ANSWER> There are 57 integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the inequality \\( -8\\pi \\leq n \\leq 10\\pi \\). </ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- By converting the inequality involving \u03c0 to numerical bounds, I was able to easily identify the range of integers that satisfy the condition.\n\n- Counting the integers within the specified bounds and verifying through quick checks ensured the correctness of the solution.\n\n- Exploring different strategies and reflecting at each step helped to confirm that the approach was valid and the answer was accurate.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walk-through provides a clear understanding of how to approach and solve the problem step by step, just like thinking through it naturally.",
  "ground_truth": "The number $\\pi$ is between $3.14$ and $3.15$, so $-8\\pi$ is between $-8(3.15) = 25.2$ and $-8(3.14) = 25.12$. Likewise, $10\\pi$ is between $31.4$ and $31.5$. This suffices to establish that the integers $n$ between $-8\\pi$ and $10\\pi$ are precisely $$-25, -24, -23, -22, \\ldots, 28, 29, 30, 31.$$ There are $25$ negative integers in this list, $31$ positive integers, and one more integer ($0$), making $\\boxed{57}$ integers in total."
