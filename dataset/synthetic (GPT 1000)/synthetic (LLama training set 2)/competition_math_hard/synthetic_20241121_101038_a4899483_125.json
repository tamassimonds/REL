  "solution": "**Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking through it just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work as I go along.**\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem is to simplify \\(\\frac{1-i}{2+3i}\\), where \\(i^2 = -1\\).\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a complex number division problem. I remember dealing with complex numbers in algebra, and it reminds me of rationalizing denominators.\n  \n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Rationalize the Denominator:** Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.\n  2. **Convert to Polar Form:** Maybe convert both numbers to polar form and divide.\n  3. **Use Algebraic Identities:** Perhaps use properties of \\(i\\).\n\n**Honestly, rationalizing the denominator seems like the most straightforward approach, but I'll keep the other methods in mind in case the first one doesn't work out.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Rationalizing the Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:** \n\n- **Strategy Choice:** Let's start by rationalizing the denominator. This method usually helps eliminate the imaginary part from the denominator.\n  \n- **Action:** Multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.\n\n**Calculations:** \n\nThe conjugate of \\(2 + 3i\\) is \\(2 - 3i\\). So, I'll multiply both the top and bottom by \\(2 - 3i\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1-i}{2+3i} \\times \\frac{2-3i}{2-3i} = \\frac{(1-i)(2-3i)}{(2+3i)(2-3i)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, multiplying by the conjugate should help remove \\(i\\) from the denominator.\n  \n- **Check:** Let's proceed and see if it simplifies correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Denominator**\n\n**Thought Process:** \n\n- **Next Move:** Let's handle the denominator first to ensure it becomes a real number.\n\n**Calculations:** \n\n\\[\n(2+3i)(2-3i) = 2^2 - (3i)^2 = 4 - 9(-1) = 4 + 9 = 13\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n\n- **Is This Correct?** Yes, the denominator simplifies to 13, a real number.\n  \n- **Quick Check:** Perfect! No imaginary part remains.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Numerator**\n\n**Thought Process:** \n\n- **Proceeding with the Numerator:** Now, let's expand the numerator.\n\n**Calculations:** \n\n\\[\n(1-i)(2-3i) = 1 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot (-3i) - i \\cdot 2 - i \\cdot (-3i) \n\\]\n\\[\n= 2 - 3i - 2i + 3i^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2 - 5i + 3(-1) \n\\]\n\\[\n= 2 - 5i - 3 \n\\]\n\\[\n= -1 - 5i\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n\n- **Does This Look Right?** Wait a minute, let me double-check that arithmetic.\n  \n- **Check Calculation:** \n  - \\(3i^2 = 3(-1) = -3\\) \u2014 Okay, that's correct.\n  - Adding \\(2 - 3 = -1\\) \u2014 Yup, that checks out.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** The numerator simplifies to \\(-1 - 5i\\). All good here!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Putting It All Together**\n\n**Thought Process:** \n\n- **Final Assembly:** Now, let's put the simplified numerator and denominator together.\n\n**Calculations:** \n\n\\[\n\\frac{-1 - 5i}{13}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n\n- **Is This the Simplified Form?** This looks like it's in the simplest form, but let's see if it can be broken down further.\n  \n- **Quick Mental Check:** Dividing both the real and imaginary parts by 13 individually might make it clearer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Expressing as Separate Real and Imaginary Parts**\n\n**Thought Process:** \n\n- **Clarity Check:** Separating the real and imaginary components can make the answer cleaner.\n\n**Calculations:** \n\n\\[\n\\frac{-1}{13} - \\frac{5}{13}i\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** \n\n- **Is This Necessary?** It makes the final answer more readable, so yes.\n  \n- **Final Check:** Looks neat and correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Converting to Polar Form**\n\n**Thought Process:** \n\n- **Exploring Other Methods:** Just to verify, let's briefly consider converting to polar form to see if it matches.\n  \n- **Action:** Compute magnitudes and angles, then divide.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Magnitude of Numerator:** \\(|1-i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}\\)  \n- **Magnitude of Denominator:** \\(|2+3i| = \\sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{13}\\)  \n- **Ratio of Magnitudes:** \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{13}}\\)  \n- **Angles:** Compute arctans, but this seems more complicated.\n\n**Reflection:** \n\n- **Is This Efficient?** Actually, this method is more cumbersome for this problem.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** Sticking with the original approach is better. Sometimes, the first instinct is the right one!\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:** \n\n- **Verification:** Does the final answer make sense? Is there any part that feels off?\n  \n- **Quick Test:** Plugging back into the original equation to see if it holds can be tricky, but let's trust the arithmetic.\n\n**Reflection:** \n\n- **Confidence Level:** I'm confident the steps are correct. Each part checks out logically.\n  \n- **Final Check:** No errors found in the calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution to \\(\\frac{1-i}{2+3i}\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1-i}{2+3i} = \\frac{-1}{13} - \\frac{5}{13}i\n\\]\n \n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy rationalizing the denominator, simplifying both the numerator and denominator, and expressing the result in standard form, we've successfully simplified the complex fraction. Exploring alternative methods like polar form helped confirm that rationalizing was the most efficient strategy here. Reflecting and checking at each step ensured accuracy throughout the process.",
