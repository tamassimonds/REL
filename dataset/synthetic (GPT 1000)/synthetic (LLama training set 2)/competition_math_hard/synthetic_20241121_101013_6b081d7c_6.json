  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem again. I'll keep the core ideas intact but streamline the process to present a clear, coherent solution. I'll maintain the original thought process, checking each step for correctness and adjusting as needed, just like solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem Statement**\n\nWe need to find \\( \\frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)} \\) given:\n\n\\[ x = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1 + \\ldots}} \\]\n\nThe expression is an **infinite nested fraction**. Our final goal is to express the answer in the form \\( \\frac{A + \\sqrt{B}}{C} \\), where \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) are integers, with \\( B \\) not divisible by the square of a prime. Finally, we need to compute \\( |A| + |B| + |C| \\).\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen faced with an infinite nested fraction like this, my initial instinct is to **set up an equation** where the entire expression equals \\( x \\). This approach leverages the self-repeating nature of the fraction. If this strategy doesn't work, I can explore other methods, such as looking for patterns or using convergence tests. However, setting up an equation seems the most straightforward, so I'll start there.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation**\n\nAssume the entire expression converges to \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{x} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBy equating the infinite fraction to \\( x \\), I've created a self-referential equation, which is a common technique for solving such problems.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this setup capture the essence of the infinite fraction? Yes, because replacing the nested part with \\( x \\) maintains the original structure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Equation for \\( x \\)**\n\nRearranging the equation to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[ x = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{x} \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( x \\) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n\\[ x^2 = x + \\sqrt{2} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSquaring both sides simplifies the equation into a quadratic form, which is easier to solve.\n\n**Check:**  \nDid squaring both sides correctly eliminate the fraction? Yes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Rearranging the Quadratic Equation**\n\nBring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[ x^2 - x - \\sqrt{2} = 0 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWriting the equation in standard quadratic form prepares it for applying the quadratic formula.\n\n**Check:**  \nIs the quadratic equation set up correctly? Yes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Applying the Quadratic Formula**\n\nRecall the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nFor our equation:\n\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -1 \\)\n- \\( c = -\\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nPlug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nCalculating the discriminant \\( 1 + 4\\sqrt{2} \\) ensures that the roots are real.\n\n**Check:**  \nIs the discriminant positive? Yes, so we have real solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Choosing the Appropriate Root**\n\nSince \\( x \\) represents a positive quantity (as it's a sum of positive terms), we'll select the positive root:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nChoosing the negative root would yield an invalid (negative or zero) value for \\( x \\), which doesn't fit our original expression.\n\n**Check:**  \nIs selecting the positive root appropriate? Yes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Simplifying \\( \\sqrt{1 + 4\\sqrt{2}} \\)**\n\nLet's see if we can simplify \\( \\sqrt{1 + 4\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\n\\[ \\text{Hmm, this expression looks a bit messy. Maybe I can try to simplify it by looking for a perfect square, but nothing immediate comes to mind.} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAttempting to simplify might complicate things further. It's better to leave it as is for now.\n\n**Check:**  \nNo obvious simplification, so proceed with the expression as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Revisiting the Original Question**\n\nNow that we have \\( x \\), we need to find:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)} \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo compute this, I'll first express \\( x+1 \\) and \\( x-2 \\), then multiply them, and finally take the reciprocal.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nCareful algebraic manipulation is essential here to avoid mistakes.\n\n**Check:**  \nLet's proceed step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Calculating \\( x+1 \\) and \\( x-2 \\)**\n\nFirst, compute \\( x+1 \\) and \\( x-2 \\):\n\n\\[ x + 1 = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4\\sqrt{2}}}{2} + 1 = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{1 + 4\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ x - 2 = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + 4\\sqrt{2}}}{2} - 2 = \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{1 + 4\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAdding and subtracting 2 to \\( x \\) prepares the expressions for multiplication.\n\n**Check:**  \nAre the calculations correct? Yes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Multiplying \\( (x+1)(x-2) \\)**\n\nNow, compute:\n\n\\[ (x+1)(x-2) = \\left( \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{1 + 4\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{1 + 4\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\right) \\]\n\nThis resembles the **difference of squares**:\n\n\\[ (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( a = \\sqrt{1 + 4\\sqrt{2}} \\)\n- \\( b = 3 \\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ (x+1)(x-2) = \\frac{(\\sqrt{1 + 4\\sqrt{2}})^2 - 3^2}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{1 + 4\\sqrt{2} - 9}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{-8 + 4\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ = -2 + \\sqrt{2} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nApplying the difference of squares simplifies the expression neatly.\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes the arithmetic check out? Yes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Finding \\( \\frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)} \\)**\n\nNow, we need to find:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)} = \\frac{1}{-2 + \\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo simplify this expression, I'll **rationalize the denominator**.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nRationalizing the denominator is a standard technique to eliminate radicals from the denominator.\n\n**Check:**  \nProceed with rationalization.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 11: Rationalizing the Denominator**\n\nMultiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{-2 + \\sqrt{2}} \\times \\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{2}}{-2 - \\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\nThis yields:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{2}}{(-2)^2 - (\\sqrt{2})^2} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{2}}{4 - 2} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{2}}{2} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nMultiplying by the conjugate simplifies the denominator to an integer, making the expression easier to handle.\n\n**Check:**  \nIs the denominator simplified correctly? Yes, it becomes 2.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 12: Final Simplification**\n\nDivide both terms in the numerator by the denominator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-2}{2} + \\frac{-\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ = -1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBreaking down the fraction ensures that both terms are simplified individually.\n\n**Check:**  \nIs the expression now in its simplest form? Yes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 13: Expressing the Answer in the Required Form**\n\nWe need to express our solution in the form:\n\n\\[ \\frac{A + \\sqrt{B}}{C} \\]\n\nLet's rewrite our expression accordingly:\n\n\\[ -1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{-2}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{2}}{2} \\]\n\nSo:\n\n- \\( A = -2 \\)\n- \\( B = 2 \\)\n- \\( C = 2 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nRewriting the expression to fit the required format helps in identifying the values of \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\).\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes the expression match the desired format? Yes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 14: Calculating \\( |A| + |B| + |C| \\)**\n\nCompute the sum of the absolute values:\n\n\\[ |A| + |B| + |C| = |-2| + |2| + |2| = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nTaking the absolute values ensures that all contributions are positive, as required by the problem.\n\n**Check:**  \nIs the final computation correct? Yes.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>6 solution</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically setting up an equation, solving for \\( x \\), and carefully simplifying the resulting expressions, we've determined that:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)} = -1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{2}}{2}\\]\n\nExpressed in the required form:\n\n\\[\\frac{A + \\sqrt{B}}{C} = \\frac{-2 - \\sqrt{2}}{2}\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( A = -2 \\)\n- \\( B = 2 \\)\n- \\( C = 2 \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ |A| + |B| + |C| = 6 \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Verification**\n\nThroughout the process, I regularly checked each step to ensure correctness. Starting with a straightforward strategy\u2014setting up an equation\u2014and being open to adjusting the approach as needed allowed me to arrive at the correct solution efficiently. Rationalizing the denominator was crucial for simplifying the final expression, and breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts helped maintain accuracy.\n\nIn conclusion, taking a methodical approach, reflecting on each step, and verifying correctness at every stage ensured that the solution was both accurate and complete. The final answer, \\( |A| + |B| + |C| = 6 \\), aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to ask if you'd like to explore different strategies or need further clarification on any step!",
  "ground_truth": "We can tell that $x-1=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1+\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1+...}}$, and then $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{x-1}=1+\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1+\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{1+...}}=x$. Solving for $x$, we find $\\sqrt{2}=x(x-1)$, which means $x^{2}-x=\\sqrt{2}$. Simplify the denominator of $\\frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)}$ to obtain $\\frac{1}{x^2-x-2}$. Substituting for $x^2-x$, we get $\\frac{1}{(x+1)(x-2)}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-2}$. To rationalize the denominator, we multiply by the conjugate of $\\sqrt{2}-2$. We have $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-2} = \\frac{1\\cdot(\\sqrt{2}+2)}{(\\sqrt{2}-2)\\cdot(\\sqrt{2}+2)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+2}{2-4} = \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{-2}.$ Here, we have $A=2, B=2$, and $C=-2$. So, taking the sum of the absolute values of $A$, $B$, and $C$ yields $\\boxed{6}$."
