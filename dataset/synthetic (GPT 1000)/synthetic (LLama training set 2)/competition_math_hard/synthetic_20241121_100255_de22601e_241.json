  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and verify my work to ensure accuracy. Here's how I approached it.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nLooking at the question, I see it involves an inverse function \\( f^{-1} \\) and a given table of values for \\( f(x) \\). Immediately, I recall that inverse functions swap the input and output. In other words, if \\( f(a) = b \\), then \\( f^{-1}(b) = a \\).\n\nBut wait, the question seems a bit tricky because it's asking for \\( f^{-1} \\) of an expression involving other inverse values. Hmm, I need to break this down into smaller parts to make sense of it.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Understanding Inverses:**  \n   Like I mentioned, \\( f^{-1} \\) swaps inputs and outputs. So, I might need to find specific values where \\( f(x) \\) equals certain numbers.\n\n2. **Evaluating the Expression Inside \\( f^{-1} \\):**  \n   The problem asks for \\( f^{-1} \\) of a fraction involving \\( f^{-1}(5) \\), \\( f^{-1}(13) \\), and \\( f^{-1}(1) \\). I probably need to compute these inverse values first.\n\n3. **Simplifying the Expression:**  \n   Once I have the inverse values, plug them into the fraction and simplify before applying \\( f^{-1} \\) again.\n\n4. **Checking Consistency:**  \n   After each step, ensure that the values make sense with the given table.\n\nI think starting with finding the necessary inverse values is the way to go. If that doesn't work, I'll reconsider my approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying Inverse Values**\n\nLet's find \\( f^{-1}(5) \\), \\( f^{-1}(13) \\), and \\( f^{-1}(1) \\) using the table.\n\n- **From the Table:**\n  - \\( f(x) = 5 \\) at \\( x = 13 \\)\n  - \\( f(x) = 13 \\) at \\( x = 2 \\)\n  - \\( f(x) = 1 \\) at \\( x = 5 \\)\n\nSo, we have:\n- \\( f^{-1}(5) = 13 \\)\n- \\( f^{-1}(13) = 2 \\)\n- \\( f^{-1}(1) = 5 \\)\n\n<aside>\n\u2728 **Reflection:** This seems straightforward. Each value matches the table, so I think I'm on the right track.\n</aside>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating the Inner Expression**\n\nNow, let's plug these inverse values into the expression inside \\( f^{-1} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f^{-1}(5) + f^{-1}(13)}{f^{-1}(1)} = \\frac{13 + 2}{5} = \\frac{15}{5} = 3\n\\]\n\n<aside>\n\ud83d\udd0d **Quick Check:** \\( \\frac{15}{5} \\) definitely equals 3, so this calculation looks correct.\n</aside>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying \\( f^{-1} \\) Again**\n\nThe question now simplifies to finding \\( f^{-1}(3) \\). From our table:\n\n- \\( f(x) = 3 \\) at \\( x = 1 \\)\n\nSo, \\( f^{-1}(3) = 1 \\).\n\n<aside>\n\ud83e\udd14 **Reflection:** This makes sense. The table directly provides this information, so I feel confident about it.\n</aside>\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Entire Process**\n\nLet me walk through the steps again to ensure everything flows correctly:\n\n1. **Identified Inverse Values:**  \n   - \\( f^{-1}(5) = 13 \\)  \n   - \\( f^{-1}(13) = 2 \\)  \n   - \\( f^{-1}(1) = 5 \\)  \n\n2. **Computed the Inner Expression:**  \n   - \\( \\frac{13 + 2}{5} = 3 \\)  \n\n3. **Applied \\( f^{-1} \\) to the Result:**  \n   - \\( f^{-1}(3) = 1 \\)  \n\n<aside>\n\u2705 **Everything checks out, so I believe the solution is correct.**\n</aside>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\\( f^{-1}\\left(\\frac{f^{-1}(5) + f^{-1}(13)}{f^{-1}(1)}\\right) = 1 \\)  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy breaking down the problem into manageable steps and continuously checking each part against the given data, I arrived at the correct answer. Thinking through different strategies and verifying each step ensured that the approach was correct and the solution was accurate.\n\nIf I had encountered any inconsistencies along the way, I would have revisited my calculations or reconsidered my strategy. But since everything aligned well with the table, the process was smooth and straightforward.\n\n<aside>\n\ud83d\udca1 **Additional Insight:** Always ensure that each step logically follows from the previous one, and don't hesitate to double-check your work to catch any potential errors early.\n</aside>\n\n---\n\nThat's how I tackled the problem, step by step, reflecting and verifying along the way to ensure accuracy.",
