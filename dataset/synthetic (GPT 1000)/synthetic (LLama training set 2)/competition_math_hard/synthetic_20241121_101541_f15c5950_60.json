I'll make sure to keep a friendly and conversational tone throughout.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, I need to find the sum of all distinct possible values of the product \\(GH\\) for the number \\(5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6\\) that's divisible by 72. \n\n*Hmm, I remember that being divisible by 72 means the number must be divisible by both 8 and 9. But how do I approach finding \\(G\\) and \\(H\\)?*\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use Divisibility Rules for 8 and 9:**  \n   *Maybe I can apply the rules for both 8 and 9 separately to narrow down the possible values for \\(G\\) and \\(H\\).*\n\n2. **Trial and Error with Constraints:**  \n   *I could try different combinations of \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) to see which ones work, but that might be time-consuming.*\n\n3. **Look for Patterns or Symmetry:**  \n   *Perhaps there's a pattern in the digits that I can exploit to make this easier.*\n\n**Reflection:**  \n*Using the divisibility rules seems like a systematic approach. Let\u2019s start by applying them one at a time.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Divisibility by 8**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 8, the last three digits must be divisible by 8. \n\n*So, I need to focus on \\(2H6\\). Since \\(H\\) is unknown, I'll need to find which single-digit values of \\(H\\) make \\(2H6\\) divisible by 8.*\n\n**Brainstorming Approach:**  \n*I can test each digit from 0 to 9 for \\(H\\) and see which ones make \\(2H6\\) divisible by 8.*\n\n**Testing Values for \\(H\\):**\n\n- **\\(H = 0\\):**  \n  \\(206 \\div 8 = 25.75\\) \u2192 *Not divisible*\n\n- **\\(H = 1\\):**  \n  \\(216 \\div 8 = 27\\) \u2192 *Divisible!*\n\n- **\\(H = 2\\):**  \n  \\(226 \\div 8 = 28.25\\) \u2192 *Not divisible*\n\n- **\\(H = 3\\):**  \n  \\(236 \\div 8 = 29.5\\) \u2192 *Not divisible*\n\n- **\\(H = 4\\):**  \n  \\(246 \\div 8 = 30.75\\) \u2192 *Not divisible*\n\n- **\\(H = 5\\):**  \n  \\(256 \\div 8 = 32\\) \u2192 *Divisible!*\n\n- **\\(H = 6\\):**  \n  \\(266 \\div 8 = 33.25\\) \u2192 *Not divisible*\n\n- **\\(H = 7\\):**  \n  \\(276 \\div 8 = 34.5\\) \u2192 *Not divisible*\n\n- **\\(H = 8\\):**  \n  \\(286 \\div 8 = 35.75\\) \u2192 *Not divisible*\n\n- **\\(H = 9\\):**  \n  \\(296 \\div 8 = 37\\) \u2192 *Divisible!*\n\n**Possible Values for \\(H\\):**  \n\\(H = 1, 5, 9\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \n*Alright, I've narrowed down \\(H\\) to 1, 5, and 9. Now, I need to find the corresponding values of \\(G\\) that make the entire number divisible by 9.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying Divisibility by 9**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo be divisible by 9, the sum of all digits must be divisible by 9. \n\n*I need to calculate the sum of the digits with \\(G\\) and the possible \\(H\\) values and see which \\(G\\) makes the sum divisible by 9.*\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSum of known digits:  \n\\[ \n5 + 4 + 1 + G + 5 + 0 + 7 + 2 + H + 6 = 30 + G + H \n\\]\n\n*So, \\(30 + G + H\\) needs to be divisible by 9.*\n\n**Setting Up Equations:**  \n\\[\n30 + G + H \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\implies G + H \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9} \n\\]\n*Because 30 modulo 9 is 3, so \\(G + H\\) must be 6 to make the total divisible by 9.*\n\n**Reflection:**  \n*Wait a minute, looking at this again, I see that I need to find \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) such that their sum is 6 modulo 9. Let\u2019s see which combinations fit this condition.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Finding \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) Combinations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI already have \\(H\\) as 1, 5, or 9. \n\n*Now, I need to find \\(G\\) such that \\(G + H = 6\\) modulo 9. Let\u2019s work through each case.*\n\n**Testing Combinations:**\n\n- **\\(H = 1\\):**  \n  \\(G + 1 = 6 \\rightarrow G = 5\\)\n\n- **\\(H = 5\\):**  \n  \\(G + 5 = 6 \\rightarrow G = 1\\)\n\n- **\\(H = 9\\):**  \n  \\(G + 9 = 6 \\rightarrow G = -3\\) \u2192 *But \\(G\\) must be a single digit (0-9), so this doesn't work.*\n\n**Possible Combinations:**  \n\\((G, H) = (5, 1)\\) and \\((G, H) = (1, 5)\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \n*Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to ensure I'm not missing any valid combinations. Actually, looking at this again, I realize that I might have overlooked another possibility. Let\u2019s re-evaluate the conditions.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Re-evaluating the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n*Wait, I think I see where I went wrong. I only considered \\(G + H = 6\\) modulo 9, but there might be other combinations that satisfy the divisibility by 9 condition. Let me double-check my reasoning here.*\n\n**Realization:**  \n*Oh! Actually, I should consider that \\(G + H\\) could be 6, 15, or any multiple of 9 that fits within the range of single-digit \\(G\\) and \\(H\\). This means I might have missed a valid combination.*\n\n**Reflection:**  \n*Hmm, let me try calculating the sum for different \\(H\\) values again to ensure I didn't miss anything.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Correcting the Error**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n*I need to find all possible \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) pairs that satisfy both divisibility conditions. Let's revisit the sample solution and see where my initial approach differed.*\n\n**Approach:**  \nI'll use the sample solution to guide me in correctly applying the divisibility rules.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Applying Divisibility by 8 Correctly**\n\n**Sample Solution Insight:**  \nFor \\(5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6\\) to be divisible by 8, \\(2H6\\) must be divisible by 8. Testing each digit for \\(H\\):\n\n- **\\(H = 1\\):**  \n  \\(216 \\div 8 = 27\\) \u2192 *Divisible*\n\n- **\\(H = 5\\):**  \n  \\(256 \\div 8 = 32\\) \u2192 *Divisible*\n\n- **\\(H = 9\\):**  \n  \\(296 \\div 8 = 37\\) \u2192 *Divisible*\n\n**Possible Values for \\(H\\):**  \n\\(H = 1, 5, 9\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \n*Alright, this matches my initial findings. So far, so good.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Applying Divisibility by 9 Correctly**\n\n**Sample Solution Insight:**  \nNow, use each possible value of \\(H\\) to find the corresponding \\(G\\) that makes the entire number divisible by 9.\n\n**Case 1: \\(H = 1\\)**  \nSum of digits:  \n\\[ \n5 + 4 + 1 + G + 5 + 0 + 7 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 31 + G \n\\]  \n*We need \\(31 + G\\) to be divisible by 9.*\n\n\\[\n31 + G \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\implies G \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9} \n\\]\nSince \\(G\\) must be a single digit:  \n\\(G = 5\\)\n\n**Case 2: \\(H = 5\\)**  \nSum of digits:  \n\\[ \n5 + 4 + 1 + G + 5 + 0 + 7 + 2 + 5 + 6 = 35 + G \n\\]  \n*We need \\(35 + G\\) to be divisible by 9.*\n\n\\[\n35 + G \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\implies G \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9} \n\\]\nSince \\(G\\) must be a single digit:  \n\\(G = 1\\)\n\n**Case 3: \\(H = 9\\)**  \nSum of digits:  \n\\[ \n5 + 4 + 1 + G + 5 + 0 + 7 + 2 + 9 + 6 = 39 + G \n\\]  \n*We need \\(39 + G\\) to be divisible by 9.*\n\n\\[\n39 + G \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\implies G \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9} \n\\]\nSince \\(G\\) must be a single digit:  \n\\(G = 6\\)\n\n**Possible Combinations:**  \n1. \\((H, G) = (1, 5)\\)\n2. \\((H, G) = (5, 1)\\)\n3. \\((H, G) = (9, 6)\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \n*Oh! I see where I went wrong initially. I missed the third combination where \\(H = 9\\) and \\(G = 6\\). Now I have three valid pairs instead of just two.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Calculating the Product \\(GH\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to calculate \\(GH\\) for each valid combination and find the sum of all distinct products.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **\\((G, H) = (5, 1)\\):**  \n  \\(GH = 5 \\times 1 = 5\\)\n\n- **\\((G, H) = (1, 5)\\):**  \n  \\(GH = 1 \\times 5 = 5\\)\n\n- **\\((G, H) = (6, 9)\\):**  \n  \\(GH = 6 \\times 9 = 54\\)\n\n**Sum of Distinct Products:**  \n\\(5 + 54 = 59\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \n*Initially, I only considered \\(GH = 5\\), but now I see that there's an additional product \\(GH = 54\\). So, the total sum of distinct products is 59.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Double-Checking the Work**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI want to ensure that all conditions are met and that no combinations are overlooked. \n\n*Let me revisit each step to confirm everything is correct.*\n\n**Check 1: Divisibility by 8**\n\n- **\\(H = 1\\):**  \n  \\(216 \\div 8 = 27\\) \u2192 *Divisible*\n\n- **\\(H = 5\\):**  \n  \\(256 \\div 8 = 32\\) \u2192 *Divisible*\n\n- **\\(H = 9\\):**  \n  \\(296 \\div 8 = 37\\) \u2192 *Divisible*\n\n**Check 2: Divisibility by 9**\n\n- **\\((G, H) = (5, 1)\\):**  \n  \\(31 + 5 = 36 \\div 9 = 4\\) \u2192 *Divisible*\n\n- **\\((G, H) = (1, 5)\\):**  \n  \\(31 + 1 = 32 \\div 9 = 3.555...\\) \u2192 *Wait, that can't be right...*\n\n**Reflection:**  \n*Hmm, actually, looking at this again, I realize that when \\(H = 5\\) and \\(G = 1\\), the sum is 32, which is not divisible by 9. But according to the sample solution, \\(H = 5\\) and \\(G = 1\\) should work. Let me double-check my calculations.*\n\n**Recalculating Case 2: \\(H = 5\\)**  \nSum of digits:  \n\\[ \n5 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 0 + 7 + 2 + 5 + 6 = 36 \n\\]  \n\\(36 \\div 9 = 4\\) \u2192 *Divisible*\n\n**Realization:**  \n*Oh! My initial reflection was incorrect. The sum is actually 36, not 32, so \\(H = 5\\) and \\(G = 1\\) is indeed a valid combination.*\n\n**Check 3: Additional Combination**\n\n- **\\((G, H) = (6, 9)\\):**  \n  \\(39 + 6 = 45 \\div 9 = 5\\) \u2192 *Divisible*\n\n**Final Check:**  \n*All three combinations satisfy the divisibility conditions. The products \\(GH\\) are 5 and 54, leading to a total sum of 59.*\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe sum of all distinct possible values of the product \\(GH\\) is **59**.\n\n<ANSWER>59 solution</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Corrected Approach**\n\n1. **Applied Divisibility by 8:**  \n   - Determined that \\(H = 1, 5, 9\\) make the last three digits divisible by 8.\n\n2. **Applied Divisibility by 9:**  \n   - For each valid \\(H\\), found the corresponding \\(G\\) that makes the sum of all digits divisible by 9, yielding three valid pairs: \\((5, 1)\\), \\((1, 5)\\), and \\((6, 9)\\).\n\n3. **Calculated Distinct Products \\(GH\\):**  \n   - Computed \\(GH\\) for each pair: 5 and 54.\n\n4. **Summed Distinct Products:**  \n   - Added the distinct products to get the final answer: 59.\n\n5. **Double-Checked Validity:**  \n   - Ensured that all conditions are met and no combinations were overlooked.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n*By revisiting my initial approach and carefully applying the divisibility rules, I was able to identify and correct my mistake. Initially, I missed one of the valid combinations, but by thoroughly re-examining each step, I arrived at the correct solution.*\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n*Approaching the problem step-by-step with continuous reflection and verification helped me accurately solve it. By considering different strategies and being open to adjusting my approach, I ensured that the solution was both correct and efficient. It's essential to double-check each step and be willing to revisit and refine the strategy when inconsistencies arise.*\n\n---\n\n**Make sure to provide a friendly and conversational tone throughout the explanation, reflecting genuine human problem-solving behavior.**\n\n**Use natural language prompts like \"Hmm,\" \"Wait a minute,\" and \"Actually\" to mimic a human's thought process, especially when recognizing and correcting errors.**\n\n**Ensure the final answer is clearly stated and formatted correctly to be recognized by the system.**",
