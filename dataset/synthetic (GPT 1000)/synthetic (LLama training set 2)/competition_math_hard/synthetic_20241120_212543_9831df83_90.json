    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, exploring different strategies, reflecting along the way, and checking for correctness as we proceed. We'll approach it as naturally as possible, just like brainstorming through a tricky problem.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, so Kevin Kangaroo starts at 0 on a number line and wants to reach 1. However, he can only hop **\\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)** of the remaining distance towards 1 with each hop. We're asked to determine how far Kevin has hopped after five hops and express the answer as a common fraction.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- This sounds like a geometric series problem because each hop covers a fraction of the remaining distance.\n- I recall problems where the distance covered decreases exponentially.\n- Maybe calculating the position after each hop will help.\n- Alternatively, I could try to find the total distance covered by summing each hop's length.\n\nLet's explore both strategies to see which one works best.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 1: Calculate Kevin\u2019s Position After Each Hop**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Distance Covered in Each Hop**\n\nSince Kevin hops **\\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)** of the remaining distance to 1 each time, let's calculate the position after each hop.\n\n**First Hop:**\n\n- **Remaining Distance:** \\(1 - 0 = 1\\)\n- **Hop Distance:** \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n- **New Position:** \\(0 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat makes sense. Kevin starts at 0 and hops a third of the way to 1.\n\n**Second Hop:**\n\n- **Remaining Distance:** \\(1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n- **Hop Distance:** \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{9} \\)\n- **New Position:** \\(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9} \\)\n\n**Check:**  \n\\(\\frac{5}{9}\\) is greater than \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), so this seems correct.\n\n**Third Hop:**\n\n- **Remaining Distance:** \\(1 - \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{4}{9} \\)\n- **Hop Distance:** \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{4}{27} \\)\n- **New Position:** \\(\\frac{5}{9} + \\frac{4}{27} = \\frac{15}{27} + \\frac{4}{27} = \\frac{19}{27} \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAdding fractions is straightforward here, so I think I'm on the right track.\n\n**Fourth Hop:**\n\n- **Remaining Distance:** \\(1 - \\frac{19}{27} = \\frac{8}{27} \\)\n- **Hop Distance:** \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{8}{81} \\)\n- **New Position:** \\(\\frac{19}{27} + \\frac{8}{81} = \\frac{57}{81} + \\frac{8}{81} = \\frac{65}{81} \\)\n\n**Check:**  \nConverting \\(\\frac{65}{81}\\) to a decimal is approximately 0.802, which seems reasonable.\n\n**Fifth Hop:**\n\n- **Remaining Distance:** \\(1 - \\frac{65}{81} = \\frac{16}{81} \\)\n- **Hop Distance:** \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{16}{81} = \\frac{16}{243} \\)\n- **New Position:** \\(\\frac{65}{81} + \\frac{16}{243} = \\frac{195}{243} + \\frac{16}{243} = \\frac{211}{243} \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n\\(\\frac{211}{243}\\) converted to a decimal is approximately 0.869. This seems plausible since Kevin is getting closer to 1 but not quite there yet.\n\n**Tentative Answer from Strategy 1:**  \nAfter five hops, Kevin's position is \\(\\frac{211}{243}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy 2: Calculate the Total Distance Hopped Directly by Summing Each Hop**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nInstead of tracking Kevin\u2019s position, let's sum up the distances of each hop to find the total distance hopped after five hops.\n\n**First Hop:**  \n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\n**Second Hop:**  \n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{9} \\]\n\n**Third Hop:**  \n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{4}{27} \\]\n\n**Fourth Hop:**  \n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{8}{81} \\]\n\n**Fifth Hop:**  \n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{16}{81} = \\frac{16}{243} \\]\n\n**Total Distance Hopped:**  \n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{4}{27} + \\frac{8}{81} + \\frac{16}{243} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks like a geometric series where each term is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the previous term. Let's proceed to sum them up.\n\n**Summing the Series:**\n\nTo add these fractions, let's find a common denominator.\n\n- **Denominators:** 3, 9, 27, 81, 243\n- **Least Common Denominator (LCD):** 243\n\n**Convert Each Fraction to Have a Denominator of 243:**\n\n1. \\( \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{81}{243} \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{54}{243} \\)\n3. \\( \\frac{4}{27} = \\frac{36}{243} \\)\n4. \\( \\frac{8}{81} = \\frac{24}{243} \\)\n5. \\( \\frac{16}{243} = \\frac{16}{243} \\)\n\n**Adding Them Up:**\n\n\\[ \\frac{81}{243} + \\frac{54}{243} + \\frac{36}{243} + \\frac{24}{243} + \\frac{16}{243} = \\frac{211}{243} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis matches the result from Strategy 1. It seems both approaches lead to the same conclusion, which is reassuring.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\nLet's do a quick sanity check:\n\n- After each hop, the distance reduces exponentially.\n- The sum of the series doesn't exceed 1, which makes sense since Kevin is always hopping towards 1 but never reaching it within five hops.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nAfter five hops, Kevin has hopped a total distance of \\(\\frac{211}{243}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nBy exploring both strategies\u2014calculating Kevin's position after each hop and summing the total distance of each hop\u2014we arrived at the same result. Reflecting at each step ensured that our approach was correct, and multiple methods provided a cross-verification of the answer.",

  "ground_truth": "Kevin hops $1/3$ of the remaining distance with every hop. His first hop takes $1/3$ closer. For his second hop, he has $2/3$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)(1/3)$. For his third hop, he has $(2/3)^2$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)^2(1/3)$. In general, Kevin hops forward $(2/3)^{k-1}(1/3)$ on his $k$th hop. We want to find how far he has hopped after five hops. This is a finite geometric series with first term $1/3$, common ratio $2/3$, and five terms. Thus, Kevin has hopped $\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5\\right)}{1-\\frac{2}{3}} = \\boxed{\\frac{211}{243}}$."
