  "problem": "A state requires that all boat licenses consist of the letter A or M followed by any five digits. What is the number of groups of letters and numbers available for boat licenses?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's approach this like a real brainstorming session. I'll let my thoughts flow naturally, exploring different strategies, reflecting frequently, and adjusting as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Impressions**\n\nAlright, looking at this question, my initial thought is that it resembles problems I've encountered before involving combinations of letters and digits. It mentions boat licenses consisting of either **A** or **M** followed by five digits. At first glance, it seems like a permutations or combinations problem.\n\nBut wait\u2014I need to make sure I fully understand what\u2019s being asked. The goal is to find the **number of possible boat licenses** given these constraints. \n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Basic Counting Principle:**  \n   My first instinct is to use the basic counting principle. If each position in the license has a specific number of choices, multiplying those choices might give the total number.\n\n2. **Permutation Approach:**  \n   Another idea is to consider permutations since the order of digits matters after the initial letter.\n\n3. **Combination with Repetition:**  \n   Perhaps thinking about combinations with repetition could be relevant since digits can repeat.\n\nHmm...the **basic counting principle** seems the most straightforward. Let's start there, but I'll keep the other strategies in mind just in case.\n\n### **Exploring the Basic Counting Principle**\n\n**Step 1: Decide on the Letter**\n\n- The license starts with either **A** or **M**.  \n  So, there are **2 choices** for the first position.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThis part is clear\u2014only two options for the letter.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Five Digits**\n\n- Each of the five positions can be any digit from **0 to 9**.  \n  That\u2019s **10 choices** per digit.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute, let me double-check this. If each digit has 10 possibilities and there are five digits, does that mean I just multiply those together?\n\n### **Calculating the Total Combinations**\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the Choices for Digits**\n\n- For each letter, there are 10 options for each of the five digits.  \n  So, it\u2019s \\(10^5\\) for the digits.\n\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 100,000\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThat seems right\u2014100,000 combinations for the digits alone.\n\n**Step 4: Incorporate the Letter Choices**\n\n- Since there are **2 letters**, each with **100,000** digit combinations:\n\n  \\[\n  2 \\times 100,000 = 200,000\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nIs this too straightforward? Let me think\u2014each letter has its own set of digit combinations, so multiplying makes sense.\n\n### **Quick Check to Validate**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's do a quick sanity check.\n\n- **Single Letter with Digits:**  \n  If I only had one letter (say **A**), there would be 100,000 combinations. Adding **M** doubles it. That aligns with the calculation.\n\n**Another Perspective:**  \nImagine listing all licenses starting with **A**, then all with **M**\u2014it definitely adds up to 200,000.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>200,000</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Solution Reflection**\n\nLooking back, the basic counting principle was the right approach. The initial instinct to multiply the number of choices for each part of the license led directly to the correct answer. Other strategies, like permutations or combinations with repetition, weren\u2019t necessary here, but keeping them in mind helped confirm that the counting principle was suitable.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy:\n\n- **Brainstorming and exploring multiple strategies**\n- **Starting with the most straightforward method (basic counting)**\n- **Reflecting and checking at each step**\n- **Validating the final calculation with a quick check**\n\nI arrived confidently at the correct number of possible boat licenses: **200,000**.\n\n---\n\n### **Putting It All Together**\n\nIn summary, by systematically exploring different strategies and confirming each step through reflection and validation checks, I've ensured that the solution is both accurate and comprehensive. The basic counting principle provided a straightforward path to the answer, supported by consistent checks along the way.",
  "ground_truth": "There are two choices for the letter, followed by ten choices of a digit for each of the next five slots. Thus, there are $2 \\cdot 10^5 = \\boxed{200000}$ combinations."
