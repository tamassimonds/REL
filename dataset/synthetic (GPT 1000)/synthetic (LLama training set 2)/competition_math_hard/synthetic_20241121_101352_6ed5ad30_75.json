  "solution": "### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to:\n\n1. Square each integer \\( n \\) from 1 to 10.\n2. Find the remainder of each square when divided by 11 (\\( n^2 \\mod 11 \\)).\n3. Sum all the **distinct** remainders to obtain \\( m \\).\n4. Determine the quotient when \\( m \\) is divided by 11.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- My initial instinct is to compute the squares, find the remainders, identify distinct values, sum them up, and finally divide by 11.\n- Given the small range (1 to 10), a direct calculation seems straightforward and efficient.\n- Checking for repeating remainders is essential to ensure accuracy.\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Direct Calculation:** \n   - Compute \\( n^2 \\mod 11 \\) for each \\( n \\) from 1 to 10.\n   - Collect and sum the distinct remainders.\n   - Divide the sum by 11 to find the quotient.\n\n2. **Utilizing Symmetry in Modular Arithmetic:**\n   - Recognize that squaring negative equivalents modulo 11 may yield repeating remainders.\n   - This could potentially reduce calculations by leveraging symmetry.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSince the range is limited and 11 is a prime number, direct calculation is likely the most straightforward and reliable method. Let's proceed with **Strategy 1: Direct Calculation**.\n\n### **Step 3: Squaring Each Integer and Finding Remainders**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I'll create a table to organize the squares and their remainders modulo 11.\n- This will help in easily identifying distinct remainders.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\nn & n^2 & n^2 \\mod 11 \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 1^2 = 1 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 2^2 = 4 & 4 \\\\\n3 & 3^2 = 9 & 9 \\\\\n4 & 4^2 = 16 & 16 \\mod 11 = 5 \\\\\n5 & 5^2 = 25 & 25 \\mod 11 = 3 \\\\\n6 & 6^2 = 36 & 36 \\mod 11 = 3 \\\\\n7 & 7^2 = 49 & 49 \\mod 11 = 5 \\\\\n8 & 8^2 = 64 & 64 \\mod 11 = 9 \\\\\n9 & 9^2 = 81 & 81 \\mod 11 = 4 \\\\\n10 & 10^2 = 100 & 100 \\mod 11 = 1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Repeating Remainders:** I notice that some remainders repeat:\n  - \\( n = 5 \\) and \\( n = 6 \\) both give a remainder of 3.\n  - \\( n = 4 \\) and \\( n = 7 \\) both give a remainder of 5.\n  - \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 9 \\) both give a remainder of 4.\n  - \\( n = 1 \\) and \\( n = 10 \\) both give a remainder of 1.\n  - \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( n = 8 \\) both give a remainder of 9.\n- **Confirmation:** This pattern aligns with properties of modular arithmetic, indicating that remainders repeat symmetrically.\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying Distinct Remainders**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, I need to extract the distinct remainders from the list to ensure only unique values are summed.\n\n**Distinct Remainders:**\n\n- 1\n- 4\n- 9\n- 5\n- 3\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Total Distinct Remainders:** There are five distinct remainders.\n- **Validation:** Given that 11 is a prime number, it's expected that not all remainders from 0 to 10 will appear uniquely in this range of squares.\n\n### **Step 5: Summing the Distinct Remainders to Find \\( m \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Next, I'll add up all the distinct remainders to compute \\( m \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nm = 1 + 4 + 9 + 5 + 3 = 22\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Step-by-Step Addition:**\n  - \\( 1 + 4 = 5 \\)\n  - \\( 5 + 9 = 14 \\)\n  - \\( 14 + 5 = 19 \\)\n  - \\( 19 + 3 = 22 \\)\n- **Confirmation:** The sum is correct, so \\( m = 22 \\).\n\n### **Step 6: Finding the Quotient When \\( m \\) is Divided by 11**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Finally, I'll divide \\( m \\) by 11 to determine the quotient.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{11} = \\frac{22}{11} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Verification:** \n  - \\( 22 \\div 11 = 2 \\), with no remainder.\n  - This confirms that the quotient is indeed 2.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\n### **Step 7: Reflection on the Approach**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Did the strategy work?** Yes, the direct calculation method was effective for this problem's scope.\n- **Were there any obstacles?** Initially, recognizing repeating remainders was crucial to ensure only distinct values were summed.\n- **Is the final answer reasonable?** Absolutely, all calculations confirm that the quotient is 2.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Validation:** Double-checking the distinct remainders and verifying the sum before proceeding to the final division ensured accuracy.\n- **Efficiency:** Given the small range, a straightforward approach with careful checks was the best strategy.\n- **Conclusion:** The step-by-step methodical approach led to a correct and reliable solution.\n\nAlright, that's it!

  "ground_truth": "First notice that $(11-n)^2=11^2-2\\cdot 11+n^2\\equiv n^2\\pmod{11}$, and since we're asked to find distinct results, we only need to compute the squares of $n=1,2,3,4,5$. Respectively, $n^2\\equiv 1,4,9,5,3\\pmod{11}$. Thus, $1+4+9+5+3=22=11\\cdot\\boxed{2}$."
