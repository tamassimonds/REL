  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's put everything together into a clear and coherent solution while maintaining the final answer. I'll ensure the thought process flows logically, reflecting how I would naturally tackle the problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the perimeter of quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) given:\n\n- \\(\\angle B\\) is a right angle.\n- Diagonal \\(\\overline{AC}\\) is perpendicular to \\(\\overline{CD}\\).\n- Known lengths: \\(AB = 18\\), \\(BC = 21\\), and \\(CD = 14\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nTo determine the perimeter, we must find the lengths of the missing side \\(AD\\) and the diagonal \\(AC\\). Given the presence of right angles, the **Pythagorean Theorem** immediately comes to mind as a potential strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Finding Diagonal \\(AC\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince \\(\\angle B\\) is a right angle, triangle \\(ABC\\) is a right triangle. We can apply the Pythagorean theorem here to find \\(AC\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nAC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 = 18^2 + 21^2 = 324 + 441 = 765\n\\]\n\\[\nAC = \\sqrt{765} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 85} = 3\\sqrt{85}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe calculation yields \\(AC = 3\\sqrt{85}\\). Although it's an irrational number, that's perfectly fine in this context.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding Side \\(AD\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, considering triangle \\(ACD\\), where \\(\\overline{AC}\\) is perpendicular to \\(\\overline{CD}\\), we have another right triangle. We can again use the Pythagorean theorem to find \\(AD\\).\n\n**Checking:**  \nBefore proceeding, let's ensure that applying the theorem here is appropriate. Since \\(AC \\perp CD\\), triangle \\(ACD\\) is indeed a right triangle.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nAD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2 = 765 + 14^2 = 765 + 196 = 961\n\\]\n\\[\nAD = \\sqrt{961} = 31\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis worked out neatly, giving us \\(AD = 31\\), a whole number. It's always reassuring when calculations yield clean results.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Perimeter**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWith all side lengths known, we can now sum them to find the perimeter of \\(ABCD\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = AB + BC + CD + DA = 18 + 21 + 14 + 31 = 84\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAdding the side lengths gives us a perimeter of 84, which seems reasonable given the individual lengths.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Double-Checking the Work**\n\n**Final Check:**  \n- **Triangle \\(ABC\\):**  \n  - Right angle at \\(B\\): Applied Pythagorean theorem correctly to find \\(AC\\).\n\n- **Triangle \\(ACD\\):**  \n  - Right angle between \\(AC\\) and \\(CD\\): Used Pythagorean theorem again to find \\(AD\\).\n\n- **Perimeter Calculation:**  \n  - Summed all sides accurately to obtain the perimeter.\n\nEverything aligns, confirming the correctness of the approach and calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>The perimeter of quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) is 84.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nBy systematically applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangles within the quadrilateral, we successfully determined the missing side lengths and calculated the perimeter. Frequent checks ensured that each step was valid, leading confidently to the correct solution.\n\n---\n\nBy structuring the solution this way, it mirrors a natural problem-solving process\u2014starting with understanding, exploring strategies, step-by-step calculations, and constant reflections to ensure accuracy.",
