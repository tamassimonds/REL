I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their effectiveness, and make corrections as needed. I'll also include my initial thoughts, realizations, and checks throughout.\n\n---\n\n### **Problem Statement**\n\nThe sum of two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 1001. What is the largest possible value of \\(\\gcd(a, b)\\)?\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nHmm, okay. We have two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that their sum is 1001. We need to find the largest possible greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nMy initial thought is that the GCD, let's call it \\(d\\), must divide both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since \\(a + b = 1001\\), \\(d\\) must also divide 1001. This reminds me of problems where the GCD is related to the sum of the numbers.\n\nBut wait, let's back up. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by expressing \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in terms of \\(d\\) and seeing what constraints arise. Let's explore different strategies before committing to one.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Express \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in Terms of \\(d\\):**\n   - If \\(d\\) is the GCD, then \\(a = dx\\) and \\(b = dy\\) for some integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that are coprime (\\(\\gcd(x, y) = 1\\)).\n   - This gives us \\(dx + dy = 1001\\), or \\(d(x + y) = 1001\\).\n\n2. **Factor 1001:**\n   - Since \\(d\\) must divide 1001, perhaps factoring 1001 will help identify possible values for \\(d\\).\n\n3. **Maximizing \\(d\\):**\n   - To find the largest \\(d\\), we should look for the largest divisor of 1001.\n\nLet's start with the second strategy\u2014factoring 1001\u2014to identify the possible values of \\(d\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Factoring 1001**\n\nOkay, let's factor 1001 to find its divisors.\n\n- **Check for Divisibility by Small Primes:**\n  - **2:** 1001 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n  - **3:** Sum of digits \\(1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2\\), not divisible by 3.\n  - **5:** Last digit is 1, so not divisible by 5.\n  - **7:** Let's divide 1001 by 7.\n\n\\[\n1001 \\div 7 = 143\n\\]\n\n- **So, 1001 = 7 \u00d7 143.**\n\nNow, let's factor 143:\n\n- **Check for Divisibility by Small Primes:**\n  - **2:** 143 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n  - **3:** Sum of digits \\(1 + 4 + 3 = 8\\), not divisible by 3.\n  - **5:** Last digit is 3, so not divisible by 5.\n  - **7:** Let's divide 143 by 7.\n\n\\[\n143 \\div 7 = 20.428\\ldots \\quad \\text{(not an integer)}\n\\]\n\n- **11:** Alternating sum \\(1 - 4 + 3 = 0\\), which is divisible by 11.\n\n\\[\n143 \\div 11 = 13\n\\]\n\n- **So, 143 = 11 \u00d7 13.**\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13\n\\]\n\nAlright, so the prime factors of 1001 are 7, 11, and 13. The divisors of 1001 are all products of these primes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Divisors of } 1001: 1, 7, 11, 13, 77, 91, 143, 1001\n\\]\n\nWait, let's double-check this to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Products:**\n  - \\(7 \\times 11 = 77\\)\n  - \\(7 \\times 13 = 91\\)\n  - \\(11 \\times 13 = 143\\)\n  - \\(7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 1001\\)\n\nSo, all divisors are correct. I feel confident moving forward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Largest Possible \\(\\gcd(a, b)\\)**\n\nNow that we have the divisors of 1001, the largest possible GCD is the largest divisor, which is 1001.\n\nBut can \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 1001\\) make sense?\n\n- If \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 1001\\), then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would each need to be multiples of 1001.\n- However, since \\(a + b = 1001\\), the only way for this to happen is if one of them is 1001 and the other is 0.\n- But the problem states that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are **positive** integers, so this scenario is impossible.\n\nAh, I see. So, the largest **possible** value must be less than 1001. Let's consider the next largest divisor: 143.\n\nBut before finalizing, let's explore the general approach to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: General Approach Using GCD Properties**\n\nLet's revisit the first strategy where we express \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in terms of \\(d\\).\n\n- **Let \\(d = \\gcd(a, b)\\).**\n- Then, \\(a = dx\\) and \\(b = dy\\) for some integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(\\gcd(x, y) = 1\\).\n- Given \\(a + b = 1001\\), we have:\n\n\\[\ndx + dy = 1001 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad d(x + y) = 1001\n\\]\n\n- Therefore, \\(d\\) must be a divisor of 1001.\n- Let \\(k = x + y\\), so \\(d \\times k = 1001\\).\n\nOur goal is to maximize \\(d\\). To do this, \\(k\\) should be minimized because \\(d = \\frac{1001}{k}\\).\n\nBut \\(k = x + y\\) where \\(\\gcd(x, y) = 1\\). This constraint is crucial.\n\nReflection: This approach seems solid. By minimizing \\(k\\) while keeping \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coprime, we can maximize \\(d\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Smallest Possible \\(k\\)**\n\nTo maximize \\(d\\), we need to find the smallest \\(k\\) such that \\(d = \\frac{1001}{k}\\) and \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are coprime.\n\nLet's list the divisors of 1001 along with their corresponding \\(d\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\nk & d = \\frac{1001}{k} \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 1001 \\\\\n7 & 143 \\\\\n11 & 91 \\\\\n13 & 77 \\\\\n77 & 13 \\\\\n91 & 11 \\\\\n143 & 7 \\\\\n1001 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nWe already established that \\(k = 1\\) is impossible because it would imply \\(x + y = 1\\), which doesn't satisfy \\(\\gcd(x, y) = 1\\) for positive integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nNow, let's consider \\(k = 7\\):\n\n- **\\(k = 7\\):**\n  - \\(d = \\frac{1001}{7} = 143\\)\n  - We need \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(x + y = 7\\) and \\(\\gcd(x, y) = 1\\).\n\nPossible pairs \\((x, y)\\) for \\(x + y = 7\\):\n- \\(x = 1, y = 6\\): \\(\\gcd(1, 6) = 1\\)\n- \\(x = 2, y = 5\\): \\(\\gcd(2, 5) = 1\\)\n- \\(x = 3, y = 4\\): \\(\\gcd(3, 4) = 1\\)\n- \\(x = 4, y = 3\\): \\(\\gcd(4, 3) = 1\\)\n- \\(x = 5, y = 2\\): \\(\\gcd(5, 2) = 1\\)\n- \\(x = 6, y = 1\\): \\(\\gcd(6, 1) = 1\\)\n\nAll pairs satisfy \\(\\gcd(x, y) = 1\\). This works!\n\n**Reflection:** It seems that \\(k = 7\\) is valid, leading to \\(d = 143\\). But let's ensure there's no larger \\(d\\) possible by checking other values of \\(k\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Validating Other \\(k\\) Values**\n\nLet's briefly consider other \\(k\\) values to make sure we're not missing a larger \\(d\\).\n\n- **\\(k = 11\\):**\n  - \\(d = \\frac{1001}{11} = 91\\)\n  - \\(x + y = 11\\)\n  - Possible pairs: \\((1, 10), (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6), \\ldots\\)\\)\n  - All these pairs have \\(\\gcd(x, y) = 1\\), so \\(d = 91\\) is also possible, but smaller than 143.\n\n- **\\(k = 13\\):**\n  - \\(d = \\frac{1001}{13} = 77\\)\n  - \\(x + y = 13\\)\n  - Similar analysis shows that \\(\\gcd(x, y) = 1\\) is satisfied for several pairs.\n\nContinuing this way, all larger \\(k\\) values yield smaller \\(d\\). Therefore, \\(d = 143\\) when \\(k = 7\\) is indeed the largest possible GCD.\n\n**Final Check:** Does \\(d = 143\\) satisfy all conditions?\n\n- \\(a = 143x\\), \\(b = 143y\\)\n- \\(x + y = 7\\)\n- \\(\\gcd(x, y) = 1\\)\n- \\(a + b = 143 \\times 7 = 1001\\)\n\nEverything checks out. I'm confident that \\(d = 143\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and validating each step, the largest possible value of \\(\\gcd(a, b)\\) is **143**.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps!

If $a = 143$ and $b = 1001 - 143 = 858$, then $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(143,858) = 143$.  Therefore, the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ is $\\boxed{143}$."
