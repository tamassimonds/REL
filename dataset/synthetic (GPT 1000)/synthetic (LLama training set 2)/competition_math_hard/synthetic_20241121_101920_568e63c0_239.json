We'll streamline the thought process, ensuring clarity and logical flow without altering the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Perfect Squares Divisible by 24 Less Than \\(10^6\\)**\n\n---\n\n#### **Initial Brainstorming: Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem: **Find all positive perfect squares less than \\(10^6\\) that are multiples of 24.**\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of topics involving perfect squares and divisibility. However, to determine the best approach, I'll brainstorm a few strategies:\n\n1. **Listing Perfect Squares:** I could list all perfect squares under \\(10^6\\) and check which are multiples of 24. But that seems inefficient\u2014there must be a smarter way.\n\n2. **Leveraging Mathematical Properties:** Perhaps using the properties of perfect squares and their prime factorizations could help identify which are divisible by 24.\n\n3. **Focusing on Divisibility by 24:** Since 24 factors into \\(2^3 \\times 3\\), I suspect that perfect squares must include these factors in their prime decomposition.\n\n**Reflection:** Listing all perfect squares is impractical. It seems more efficient to utilize the divisibility properties of perfect squares concerning 24.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 1: Understanding Perfect Squares and Divisibility by 24**\n\nTo proceed, I need to ensure that a perfect square is divisible by 24. Let's break it down:\n\n- **Factors of 24:**  \n  \\[\n  24 = 2^3 \\times 3^1\n  \\]\n  \n- **Requirements for Perfect Squares:**  \n  Perfect squares have even exponents in their prime factorization. Therefore, to be divisible by 24, a perfect square must include at least \\(2^3\\) and \\(3^1\\).\n\n  Wait a moment\u2014does this mean the perfect square needs higher exponents? Let's clarify:\n\n  - **For \\(2^3\\):** The square of a number must have at least \\(2^3\\), so the original number needs \\(2^{3/2}\\). Since exponents must be whole numbers, the smallest even exponent covering \\(2^3\\) is \\(2^2\\).\n  \n  - **For \\(3^1\\):** Similarly, the square must have \\(3^2\\), so the original number needs \\(3^1\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe original number \\(n\\) must be divisible by:\n\\[\nn = 2^2 \\times 3 = 12\n\\]\nThis ensures that \\(n^2\\) is divisible by 24.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBy requiring \\(n\\) to be a multiple of 12, \\(n^2\\) will automatically include the necessary factors of 24.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Finding All Relevant Perfect Squares Less Than \\(10^6\\)**\n\nNow, I need to find all perfect squares \\(n^2\\) where \\(n\\) is a multiple of 12 and \\(n^2 < 10^6\\). Let's proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Determining Maximum \\(n\\):**  \n   Since \\(n^2 < 10^6\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   n < \\sqrt{10^6} = 1000\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Identifying Multiples of 12 Up to 1000:**  \n   I need to find all integers \\(k\\) such that:\n   \\[\n   n = 12k \\leq 1000\n   \\]\n   \n   Calculating the maximum \\(k\\):\n   \\[\n   12k \\leq 1000 \\implies k \\leq \\frac{1000}{12} \\approx 83.33\n   \\]\n   \n   Since \\(k\\) must be an integer, the maximum \\(k\\) is 83.\n\n3. **Verifying the Upper Limit:**  \n   Let's check:\n   \\[\n   n = 12 \\times 83 = 996,\\quad \\text{and} \\quad 996^2 = 992016 < 10^6\n   \\]\n   \n   Thus, \\(k = 83\\) is valid.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis approach ensures that all \\(n = 12k\\) up to \\(k = 83\\) yield perfect squares less than \\(10^6\\) and divisible by 24.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Calculating the Number of Perfect Squares**\n\nFinally, I need to count the number of such \\(k\\) values, which corresponds to the number of perfect squares meeting the criteria.\n\n- **Counting \\(k\\):**  \n  There are \\(k\\) values from 1 to 83 inclusive.\n\n- **Total Count:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{There are } 83 \\text{ perfect squares } n^2 \\text{ that are multiples of 24 and less than } 10^6.\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBy systematically counting the multiples of 12 up to 1000, I've accurately determined the number of valid perfect squares.\n\n---\n\n#### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>\n\n**Solution:**  \nThere are **83** positive perfect squares less than \\(10^6\\) that are multiples of 24.\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n#### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy carefully analyzing the requirements for a perfect square to be divisible by 24 and systematically calculating the relevant multiples of 12 up to \\(10^6\\), I ensured the correctness of the solution. Starting with understanding the divisibility constraints, determining the necessary factors for \\(n\\), and finally counting the appropriate perfect squares led me to the accurate answer.\n\nThis structured approach not only simplifies the problem but also verifies each step's validity, ensuring that the final count is precise and reliable.\n\n---\n\nThere we go! By organizing the initial thoughts, reflections, and step-by-step calculations into a cohesive narrative, the solution becomes clear and logically sound, leading to the correct final answer.",
  "ground_truth": "Because $24 = 3\\cdot 2^3$, a square is divisible by 24 if and only if it is divisible by $3^2\\cdot 2^4 = 144$. Furthermore, a perfect square $N^2$ less than $10^6$ is a multiple of 144 if and only if $N$ is a multiple of 12 less than $10^3$. Because 996 is the largest multiple of 12 less than $10^3$, there are $\\frac{996}{12}= 83$ such positive integers less than $10^3$ and $\\boxed{83}$ positive perfect squares which are multiples of 24."
