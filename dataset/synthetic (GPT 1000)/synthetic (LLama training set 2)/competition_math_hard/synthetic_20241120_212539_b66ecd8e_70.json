We have two functions:\n\n\\[ \n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) & = 3x^2 - 2x + 4, \\\\\ng(x) & = x^2 - kx - 6.\n\\end{align*} \n\\]\n\nWe're told that \\( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \\) and need to find the value of \\( k \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- **Evaluate \\( f(10) \\) and \\( g(10) \\):** Since the equation involves these specific points, calculating them seems like a straightforward starting point.\n- **Set Up an Equation:** Once we have expressions for \\( f(10) \\) and \\( g(10) \\), we can set up an equation based on \\( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \\) to solve for \\( k \\).\n- **Check for Simplicity:** After setting up the equation, I'll check if it simplifies nicely. If not, perhaps there's another strategy.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps and see how it goes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating \\( f(10) \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Substitute \\( x = 10 \\) into \\( f(x) \\):** This will give us the exact value of \\( f(10) \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nf(10) & = 3(10)^2 - 2(10) + 4 \\\\\n      & = 3(100) - 20 + 4 \\\\\n      & = 300 - 20 + 4 \\\\\n      & = 284.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, substituting 10 into a quadratic should yield a large-ish number, and 284 seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing \\( g(10) \\) in Terms of \\( k \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Substitute \\( x = 10 \\) into \\( g(x) \\):** This will give us an expression for \\( g(10) \\) involving \\( k \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ng(10) & = (10)^2 - k(10) - 6 \\\\\n      & = 100 - 10k - 6 \\\\\n      & = 94 - 10k.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Expression Looks Good:** We've isolated \\( g(10) \\) as \\( 94 - 10k \\), which is what we need to set up our next equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Setting Up the Equation Based on Given Information**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Use \\( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \\):** Plug the values and expression we found into this equation to solve for \\( k \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nf(10) - g(10) & = 10 \\\\\n284 - (94 - 10k) & = 10.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait a Minute:** Let\u2019s simplify this to see if it makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Simplifying the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Distribute the Negative Sign:** Carefully handle the subtraction to avoid mistakes.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n284 - 94 + 10k & = 10 \\\\\n190 + 10k & = 10.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Is This Correct?** Yes, subtracting 94 from 284 gives 190, so the equation simplifies well.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Solving for \\( k \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Isolate \\( k \\):** Subtract 190 from both sides and then divide by 10 to solve for \\( k \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n10k & = 10 - 190 \\\\\n10k & = -180 \\\\\nk & = \\frac{-180}{10} \\\\\nk & = -18.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does This Value Make Sense?**\n  - **Check the Signs:** Negative \\( k \\) implies that in \\( g(x) \\), the linear term is positive when multiplied out (\\(-k x\\)), which can affect the function's behavior. But numerically, it seems correct.\n  - **Re-check Calculations:** Let\u2019s quickly verify if substituting \\( k = -18 \\) satisfies the original condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Plug \\( k = -18 \\) Back into \\( g(10) \\):** Ensure that \\( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \\) holds true.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ng(10) & = 94 - 10(-18) \\\\\n      & = 94 + 180 \\\\\n      & = 274.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNow, check:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nf(10) - g(10) & = 284 - 274 \\\\\n              & = 10.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Perfect Match:** The condition \\( f(10) - g(10) = 10 \\) is satisfied, confirming that \\( k = -18 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategies**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Comparing Coefficients:** Initially, I considered comparing coefficients of similar terms in \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\), but since we're given specific points, direct substitution is more straightforward.\n- **Graphical Interpretation:** Visualizing how \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) behave at \\( x = 10 \\) could provide insights, but it's not necessary for this problem.\n- **Checking Extremes:** Suppose \\( k \\) had a significantly different value (e.g., \\( k = 0 \\)), we could quickly see that the condition doesn't hold, reinforcing our solution.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Direct Substitution Was Effective:** The initial approach worked smoothly without complications, making alternative strategies unnecessary in this case.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-18}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Thorough Verification:** By substituting back, we confirmed that \\( k = -18 \\) satisfies the given condition.\n- **Confidence in Solution:** The step-by-step approach ensured accuracy, and double-checking helped verify correctness.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- **Learning Point:** Even straightforward problems benefit from methodical thinking and verification. It's essential to validate each step to avoid simple arithmetic errors.",
