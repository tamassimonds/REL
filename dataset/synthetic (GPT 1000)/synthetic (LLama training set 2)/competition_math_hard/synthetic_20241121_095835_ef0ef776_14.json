  "solution": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nWe need to solve the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5x+1}{2x^2+5x-3} = \\frac{2x}{2x-1}\n\\]\n\nAt first glance, this is a rational equation with fractions involving \\( x \\). To simplify, the initial thought is to eliminate the denominators, perhaps by cross-multiplying. Let's brainstorm possible strategies:\n\n1. **Cross-Multiplication:** Eliminate fractions by cross-multiplying both sides.\n2. **Factoring the Denominator:** Check if the denominator can be factored to simplify the equation.\n3. **Substitution:** Simplify using substitution if possible.\n4. **Graphical Approach:** Visualize the functions to identify intersections.\n\nStarting with **cross-multiplication** seems straightforward, so let's proceed with that. If it doesn't work, we'll explore other methods.\n\n### Step 1: Cross-Multiplication\n\nLet's cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n(5x + 1)(2x - 1) = 2x(2x^2 + 5x - 3)\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** This transforms the equation into a polynomial, which should be easier to handle. Next, we'll expand both sides.\n\n### Step 2: Expanding Both Sides\n\n**Left Side:**\n\n\\[\n(5x + 1)(2x - 1) = 5x \\cdot 2x + 5x \\cdot (-1) + 1 \\cdot 2x + 1 \\cdot (-1)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 10x^2 - 5x + 2x - 1 = 10x^2 - 3x - 1\n\\]\n\n**Right Side:**\n\n\\[\n2x(2x^2 + 5x - 3) = 4x^3 + 10x^2 - 6x\n\\]\n\n**After Expanding:**\n\n\\[\n10x^2 - 3x - 1 = 4x^3 + 10x^2 - 6x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Now we have a polynomial equation. Let's move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero.\n\n### Step 3: Rearranging the Equation\n\nSubtract \\( 10x^2 - 3x - 1 \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0 = 4x^3 + 10x^2 - 6x - (10x^2 - 3x - 1)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n0 = 4x^3 + 10x^2 - 6x - 10x^2 + 3x + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = 4x^3 - 3x + 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation is now:\n\n\\[\n4x^3 - 3x + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** This is a cubic equation. Solving cubic equations can be tricky, so let's think about the best approach.\n\n### Step 4: Exploring Solutions for Cubic Equations\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Factoring by Grouping:** Attempt to factor the cubic equation.\n2. **Rational Root Theorem:** Check for possible rational roots.\n3. **Synthetic Division:** Use synthetic division if a root is found.\n4. **Numerical Methods:** Consider numerical solutions like the Newton-Raphson method if analytical methods are challenging.\n\nStarting with the **Rational Root Theorem** seems like a good idea to identify any simple roots.\n\n### Step 5: Applying the Rational Root Theorem\n\nAccording to the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\) of the polynomial \\( 4x^3 - 3x + 1 = 0 \\) must have \\( p \\) as a factor of the constant term (+1) and \\( q \\) as a factor of the leading coefficient (4).\n\nPossible rational roots are: \\( \\pm1, \\pm\\frac{1}{2}, \\pm\\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n**Reflection:** Let's test these possible roots to see if any satisfy the equation.\n\n### Step 6: Testing Possible Rational Roots\n\n**Testing \\( x = 1 \\):**\n\n\\[\n4(1)^3 - 3(1) + 1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2 \\neq 0\n\\]\nSo, \\( x = 1 \\) is not a root.\n\n**Testing \\( x = -1 \\):**\n\n\\[\n4(-1)^3 - 3(-1) + 1 = -4 + 3 + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\\(\\Rightarrow x = -1\\) is a root!\n\n**Thoughts:** Great! We've found a root. Now, we can use synthetic division to factor the cubic equation.\n\n### Step 7: Synthetic Division to Factor the Cubic\n\nSince \\( x = -1 \\) is a root, we can divide the cubic polynomial by \\( x + 1 \\).\n\nPerforming synthetic division:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|rrrr}\n-1 & 4 & 0 & -3 & 1 \\\\\n   &   & -4 & 4 & -1 \\\\\n\\hline\n   & 4 & -4 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- Bring down the 4.\n- Multiply -1 by 4, add to the next coefficient: \\( 0 + (-4) = -4 \\).\n- Multiply -1 by -4, add to the next coefficient: \\( -3 + 4 = 1 \\).\n- Multiply -1 by 1, add to the last coefficient: \\( 1 + (-1) = 0 \\).\n\n**Result:**\n\n\\[\n4x^2 - 4x + 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the cubic equation factors as:\n\n\\[\n4x^3 - 3x + 1 = (x + 1)(4x^2 - 4x + 1)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Now, we need to solve the quadratic \\( 4x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 \\) to find the remaining roots.\n\n### Step 8: Solving the Quadratic Equation\n\nThe quadratic equation is:\n\n\\[\n4x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe'll use the **quadratic formula**:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( a = 4 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = 1 \\).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 1}}{2 \\cdot 4}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 16}}{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:** So, the quadratic equation has a **double root** at \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n### Step 9: Listing All Solutions\n\nFrom our factoring and solving steps, we have:\n\n1. \\( x = -1 \\)\n2. \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\) (double root)\n\n**Reflection:** These are the solutions to the original equation. However, it's essential to **verify** them by substituting back into the original equation to ensure no extraneous solutions were introduced.\n\n### Step 10: Verifying the Solutions\n\n**1. Verifying \\( x = -1 \\):**\n\nSubstitute \\( x = -1 \\) into the original equation:\n\nLeft side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5(-1) + 1}{2(-1)^2 + 5(-1) - 3} = \\frac{-5 + 1}{2 - 5 - 3} = \\frac{-4}{-6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nRight side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2(-1)}{2(-1) - 1} = \\frac{-2}{-2 - 1} = \\frac{-2}{-3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\(\\Rightarrow \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\), so \\( x = -1 \\) is a valid solution.\n\n**2. Verifying \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\):**\n\nSubstitute \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\) into the original equation:\n\nLeft side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 1}{2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + 5\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 3} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{2} + 1}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{5}{2} - 3} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{2}}{\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{6}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{2}}{-\\frac{3}{2}} = -\\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\nRight side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 1} = \\frac{1}{1 - 1} = \\frac{1}{0}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait a minute! The right side becomes undefined at \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\) because the denominator is zero. This means that \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\) is actually an **extraneous solution** introduced during the solving process.\n\n**Thoughts:** Even though \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\) appeared as a root of the quadratic, it doesn't satisfy the original equation because it makes the denominator zero on the right side, leading to an undefined expression.\n\n### Final Reflection and Conclusion\n\nAfter verifying, we see that:\n\n- \\( x = -1 \\) is a **valid solution**.\n- \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\) is an **extraneous solution** because it makes the denominator zero in the original equation, resulting in an undefined expression.\n\n**<ANSWER> solution**\n\n\\[\nx = -1\n\\]\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nIt's crucial to always **verify** solutions, especially when dealing with rational equations, to ensure no extraneous solutions are included. In this case, although the quadratic equation yielded \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\) as a root, substituting back into the original equation revealed that it makes the denominator zero on the right side, thus invalidating it as a solution. Only \\( x = -1 \\) satisfies the original equation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **First Thoughts:** Identify the equation as rational; brainstorm strategies like cross-multiplication and factoring.\n- **Step 1:** Use cross-multiplication to eliminate fractions.\n- **Step 2:** Expand both sides to form a polynomial equation.\n- **Step 3:** Rearrange the equation to set it to zero.\n- **Step 4:** Explore solving the cubic equation using the Rational Root Theorem.\n- **Step 5:** Apply the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots.\n- **Step 6:** Test rational roots and identify \\( x = -1 \\) as a valid root.\n- **Step 7:** Use synthetic division to factor the cubic equation.\n- **Step 8:** Solve the resulting quadratic equation to find \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\) as a double root.\n- **Step 9:** List all solutions, but emphasize the need for verification.\n- **Step 10:** Verify each solution by substituting back into the original equation.\n  - **Verification of \\( x = -1 \\):** Confirmed as a valid solution.\n  - **Verification of \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\):** Identified as an extraneous solution due to division by zero.\n- **Final Reflection:** Conclude that \\( x = -1 \\) is the only valid solution after verification.\n- **Importance of Verification:** Reinforce that checking solutions is essential to avoid extraneous roots, especially in rational equations where variables appear in denominators.\n\nBy systematically exploring and verifying each step, we ensure that our final solution is accurate and free from extraneous roots.",
  "ground_truth": "We notice that the denominator on the left factors, giving us \\[\\frac{5x+1}{(2x-1)(x+3)}=\\frac{2x}{2x-1}.\\]As long as $x\\neq\\frac12$ we are allowed to cancel $2x-1$ from the denominators, giving \\[\\frac{5x+1}{x+3}=2x.\\]Now we can cross-multiply to find \\[5x+1=2x(x+3)=2x^2+6x.\\]We simplify this to  \\[2x^2+x-1=0\\]and then factor to  \\[(x+1)(2x-1)=0.\\]Notice that since $2x-1$ is in the denominator of the original equation, $x=\\frac12$ is an extraneous solution.  However $x=\\boxed{-1}$ does solve the original equation."
