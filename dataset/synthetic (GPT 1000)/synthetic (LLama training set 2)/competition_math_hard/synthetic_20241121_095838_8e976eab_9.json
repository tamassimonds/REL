  "solution": "Absolutely, let's craft a concise yet detailed solution reflecting the thought process, ensuring clarity and coherence while maintaining the original answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the greatest integer less than 100 whose greatest common factor (GCF) with 18 is exactly 3.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- This involves GCF and divisibility.\n- The number must share only 3 as a common factor with 18.\n- It should be divisible by 3 but not by any higher factors of 18.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **List Multiples of 3:** Identify numbers divisible by 3 but not by 6 or 9.\n2. **Exclude Higher Multiples:** Remove numbers divisible by 6 and 9 from the list of multiples of 3.\n3. **Verify the Largest Valid Number:** Ensure the GCF with 18 is exactly 3.\n\nLet's proceed with these strategies.\n\n### **Step 1: Listing Multiples of 3 Below 100**\n\nList all multiples of 3 up to 99:\n\n\\[\n3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Need to exclude multiples of 6 and 9 to ensure the GCF is exactly 3.\n\n### **Step 2: Excluding Multiples of 6 and 9**\n\nIdentify and remove multiples of 6 and 9:\n\n- **Multiples of 6:** 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96.\n- **Multiples of 9:** 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99.\n\nAfter removing these from the multiples of 3:\n\n\\[\n3, 15, 21, 33, 39, 51, 57, 69, 75, 87, 93\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- Each remaining number is divisible by 3 but not by 6 or 9.\n\n### **Step 3: Identifying the Greatest Valid Number**\n\nFrom the filtered list, the greatest number less than 100 is **93**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Need to verify that the GCF of 93 and 18 is exactly 3.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the GCF of 93 and 18**\n\nUse the **Euclidean Algorithm**:\n\n1. \\(93 \\div 18 = 5\\) remainder **3**  \n   \\((93 = 18 \\times 5 + 3)\\)\n2. \\(18 \\div 3 = 6\\) remainder **0**  \n   \\((18 = 3 \\times 6 + 0)\\)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The GCF is **3**, confirming that 93 meets the criteria.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{93}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Initial Strategy Validated:** Listing and excluding higher multiples effectively narrowed down the candidates.\n- **Verification Essential:** The Euclidean Algorithm confirmed the correctness.\n- **Multiple Checks Ensured Accuracy:** No steps were overlooked, leading confidently to the correct answer.\n\nBy systematically applying each strategy, reflecting at every step, and verifying the outcome, we've arrived at the greatest integer less than 100 whose GCF with 18 is exactly 3: **93**.",
  "ground_truth": "The prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3. If the greatest common factor with 18 is 3, that means the other number is a multiple of 3 but not 2, 6, or 9. Since the other number cannot be an even number (multiple of 2), we start with 99 and look at decreasing odd numbers. 99 is a multiple of 9, 97 and 95 are not multiples of 3, so the greatest integer less than 100 that satisfies the conditions is $\\boxed{93}$."
