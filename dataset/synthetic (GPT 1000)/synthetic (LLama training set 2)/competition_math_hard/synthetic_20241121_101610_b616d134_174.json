  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, refining our approach to create a coherent and complete solution. I'll draw from the original workings while making the thought process more fluid and structured. Here's how I would put it all together:\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to determine how many distinct natural-number factors the expression \\(4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2\\) has.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nWhen I see this problem, several strategies come to mind:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization Approach:**  \n   Break down each component into its prime factors, then use the exponents to calculate the total number of factors.\n\n2. **Direct Calculation:**  \n   Attempt to list out all factors manually\u2014though this seems tedious for large exponents.\n\n3. **Use of Factor Pairs:**  \n   Pairing factors to simplify counting, but again, this might be cumbersome here.\n\n**Leaning Towards:**  \nThe **Prime Factorization Approach** appears the most systematic and efficient. Let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Prime Factorization of Each Component**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nExpress each part of \\(4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2\\) in terms of prime numbers to simplify the expression.\n\n- **Starting with \\(4^3\\):**  \n  \\[\n  4 = 2^2 \\implies 4^3 = (2^2)^3 = 2^{2 \\times 3} = 2^6\n  \\]\n\n- **Next, \\(5^4\\):**  \n  \\(5\\) is already a prime number, so:\n  \\[\n  5^4 = 5^4\n  \\]\n\n- **Finally, \\(6^2\\):**  \n  \\[\n  6 = 2 \\times 3 \\implies 6^2 = (2 \\times 3)^2 = 2^2 \\times 3^2\n  \\]\n\n**Intermediate Expression:**  \nCombining these, the original expression becomes:\n\\[\n4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2 = 2^6 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 3^2)\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Combining Like Prime Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nCombine the exponents of the same prime factors to simplify the expression further.\n\n- **Combining Exponents for \\(2\\):**  \n  \\[\n  2^6 \\cdot 2^2 = 2^{6 + 2} = 2^8\n  \\]\n\n**Simplified Prime Factorization:**  \n\\[\n2^8 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Factors Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nUse the formula for determining the total number of factors from prime exponents:\n\\[\n(\\text{Exponent of } p_1 + 1) \\times (\\text{Exponent of } p_2 + 1) \\times \\ldots\n\\]\n\n- **Applying to Our Case:**  \n  \\[\n  (8 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) \\times (4 + 1) = 9 \\times 3 \\times 5\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculating:**  \n  \\[\n  9 \\times 3 = 27\n\n  27 \\times 5 = 135\n  \\]\n\n**Intermediate Conclusion:**  \nThe total number of distinct natural-number factors is **135**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAlways good to double-check the method to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Alternative Strategy Check:**  \n  - **Listing Factors Manually:**  \n    Given there are 135 factors, listing them all isn't practical, confirming that prime factorization is the right approach.\n\n  - **Factor Pairs:**  \n    Again, with such a large number, pairing would be inefficient.\n\n- **Reflecting on the Formula:**  \n  The formula accounts for all combinations of exponents, ensuring that all factors are considered.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nNo errors detected in combining exponents or applying the formula. The calculations were straightforward and verified along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{135}\n\\]\n\nThe expression \\(4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2\\) has **135** distinct natural-number factors.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically breaking down the expression into its prime factors and applying the factors formula, we efficiently determined the total number of distinct factors. Regular checks ensured accuracy, and alternative strategies were considered but deemed impractical, validating the chosen approach.\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration provides clarity on tackling such problems using prime factorization!",
  "ground_truth": "We prime factorize the given number as $2^8\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^4$. A factor of this number takes the form $2^a3^b5^c$ for integers $a$ between 0 and 8, $b$ between 0 and 2, and $c$ between 0 and 4. There are $9$ ways to choose $a$, 3 ways to choose $b$, and 5 ways to choose $c$. In total, there are $9\\cdot3\\cdot5 = \\boxed{135}$ factors."
