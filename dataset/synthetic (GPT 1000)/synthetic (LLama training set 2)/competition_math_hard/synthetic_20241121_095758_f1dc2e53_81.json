  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, reflecting, brainstorming, and checking my work along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Impressions**\n\nOkay, so we have a piecewise function \\( f(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n2x^2 - 3 & \\text{if } x \\leq 2, \\\\\nax + 4 & \\text{if } x > 2.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThe goal is to find the value of \\( a \\) that makes the graph of \\( f(x) \\) continuous. \n\n**Initial Thoughts:**  \nThis reminds me of continuity problems where we need to ensure no jumps or breaks in the graph at the point where the piecewise functions meet, which is \\( x = 2 \\) in this case. I think I'll need to set the two pieces equal at \\( x = 2 \\) to ensure continuity.\n\nBut wait, let's explore different strategies to be sure...\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Set the Two Parts Equal at \\( x = 2 \\):**  \n   Ensure that both pieces of the function meet at \\( x = 2 \\) by equating them.\n\n2. **Check Derivatives for Smoothness:**  \n   Maybe check if the derivatives match at \\( x = 2 \\) for smoothness, but since the question only asks for continuity, this might be overkill.\n\n3. **Graph the Function:**  \n   Visualize the function to see where the discontinuity might occur, but this is more of a verification step.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSince the problem specifically asks for continuity, the first strategy seems the most direct. Checking derivatives would be necessary for differentiability, but not required here. Graphing could help, but it's not essential for finding \\( a \\).\n\nI'll proceed with **Strategy 1: Setting the Two Parts Equal at \\( x = 2 \\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Ensuring Continuity at \\( x = 2 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFor the function to be continuous at \\( x = 2 \\), both pieces must have the same value at that point. This means:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{{x \\to 2^-}} f(x) = \\lim_{{x \\to 2^+}} f(x) = f(2)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nYeah, that makes sense. If both limits agree and equal \\( f(2) \\), there won't be any jumps in the graph.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Left-Hand Limit (\\( x \\to 2^- \\)):**\n\n  Using \\( f(x) = 2x^2 - 3 \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  \\lim_{{x \\to 2^-}} f(x) = 2(2)^2 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5\n  \\]\n\n- **Right-Hand Limit (\\( x \\to 2^+ \\)):**\n\n  Using \\( f(x) = ax + 4 \\):\n  \n  \\[\n  \\lim_{{x \\to 2^+}} f(x) = a(2) + 4 = 2a + 4\n  \\]\n\n**Setting the Limits Equal:**\n\n\\[\n5 = 2a + 4\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Moment:**  \nThis equation looks straightforward, but let's double-check to ensure no mistakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving for \\( a \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI need to solve the equation \\( 5 = 2a + 4 \\) for \\( a \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n5 - 4 = 2a \\\\\n1 = 2a \\\\\na = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this value make sense? Plugging \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\) back into the right-hand limit:\n\n\\[\n2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5\n\\]\n\nWhich matches the left-hand limit. So, it seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Checking Derivatives (Optional)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEven though the problem only asks for continuity, checking the derivatives at \\( x = 2 \\) could confirm smoothness. Let's explore this briefly to ensure our solution is robust.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Derivative of the Left Piece (\\( x \\leq 2 \\)):**\n\n  \\( f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(2x^2 - 3) = 4x \\)\n\n  At \\( x = 2 \\): \n  \n  \\( f'(2) = 4(2) = 8 \\)\n\n- **Derivative of the Right Piece (\\( x > 2 \\)):**\n\n  \\( f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(ax + 4) = a \\)\n\n**Setting Derivatives Equal:**\n\n\\[\n8 = a\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a second! This suggests \\( a = 8 \\), which contradicts our previous finding of \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\). But recall that differentiability requires matching derivatives, which is a stronger condition than continuity. Since the problem only asks for continuity, the initial solution \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\) is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe derivative check indicates that for smoothness (differentiability) at \\( x = 2 \\), \\( a \\) would need to be 8. However, since we're only concerned with continuity, \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\) is sufficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Verifying Continuity**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing, let's ensure that with \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\), the function is continuous at \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Left-Hand Limit:**  \n  Already calculated as 5.\n\n- **Right-Hand Limit with \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\):**  \n  \n  \\[\n  2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5\n  \\]\n\n- **Value at \\( x = 2 \\):**  \n  \n  \\( f(2) = 2(2)^2 - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll limits and the function value at \\( x = 2 \\) agree, confirming continuity. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>**\n\n\\(<ANSWER>a = \\frac{1}{2}</ANSWER>\\)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe function \\( f(x) \\) is continuous at \\( x = 2 \\) when \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThis approach worked well by directly setting the two parts of the function equal at the point of transition. Checking the derivatives provided additional insight, confirming that while continuity is maintained with \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\), differentiability would require a different value for \\( a \\). However, since the problem only demands continuity, our solution is correct.\n\n<ANSWER>a = \\frac{1}{2}</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "If the graph of $f$ is continuous, then the graphs of the two cases must meet when $x=2,$ which (loosely speaking) is the dividing point between the two cases. Therefore, we must have $2\\cdot 2^2 -3 = 2a + 4.$ Solving this equation gives $a = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.$"
