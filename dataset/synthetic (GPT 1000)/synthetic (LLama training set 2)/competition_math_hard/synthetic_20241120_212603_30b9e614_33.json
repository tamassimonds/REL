    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, embracing the natural thinking process, brainstorming different strategies, and reflecting along the way to ensure we're on the right track. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, we have a regular hexagon-shaped park with each side measuring 2 km. Alice starts walking from a corner and travels 5 km along the perimeter. The question asks how far she is from her starting point after walking this distance.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- **Hexagon Geometry:** I know that a regular hexagon has equal sides and equal angles. Maybe the internal angles will come into play.\n- **Distance Traveled vs. Perimeter:** Walking 5 km means she covers more than two sides but less than three since each side is 2 km.\n- **Possible Strategies:** I could visualize her path, use geometric properties, or possibly coordinate geometry to calculate the distance back to the starting point.\n\n**Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure how the angles will affect her final position. Perhaps drawing a diagram will help.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Draw a Diagram:** Visual representation might clarify her path and final position.\n2. **Use Trigonometry:** Knowing the angles in a hexagon could help compute the final distance.\n3. **Coordinate Geometry:** Assign coordinates to each corner and calculate her final position numerically.\n4. **Vector Addition:** Treat each side as a vector and sum them to find the resultant position.\n\n**Which to Try First?** I think starting with a diagram is always helpful to visualize the problem better.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Drawing a Diagram**\n\nLet\u2019s draw a regular hexagon and label the corners A, B, C, D, E, F in a clockwise direction. Each side is 2 km.\n\n- **Starting Point:** Alice begins at corner A.\n- **Walking Path:** She walks 5 km along the perimeter.\n\nGiven each side is 2 km:\n- After 2 km, she reaches corner B.\n- After another 2 km (total 4 km), she reaches corner C.\n- She needs to walk 1 km more (since 5 km total - 4 km already walked = 1 km) along the side from C to D.\n\n**Reflection:** So, Alice ends up 1 km into the side CD. This partial movement along CD will determine her final position.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing the Hexagon\u2019s Geometry**\n\nNow, let\u2019s think about the internal angles and how moving along side CD affects her position relative to the starting point A.\n\n**Properties of a Regular Hexagon:**\n- All internal angles are 120 degrees.\n- Each side is equal in length.\n\n**Considering Coordinates:**\n- Perhaps assigning coordinates to each corner will help calculate the exact position where Alice stops.\n\n**Possible Approach:** Use coordinate geometry to find the exact end point and then calculate the distance back to A.\n\n**Alternative Idea:** Maybe we can use vectors to represent her movement and sum them up.\n\n**Decision:** I\u2019ll proceed with assigning coordinates to make calculations straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Assigning Coordinates**\n\nLet\u2019s assign coordinates assuming the center of the hexagon is at the origin (0,0) for simplicity.\n\n- **Point A:** Let\u2019s place A at (2,0) for straightforwardness.\n- **Point B:** Moving 120 degrees from A, point B would be at (1, \u221a3).\n- **Point C:** Next, C would be at (-1, \u221a3).\n- **Point D:** Then, D at (-2,0).\n- **Point E:** E at (-1, -\u221a3).\n- **Point F:** F at (1, -\u221a3).\n\nWait, let me think. Maybe it's easier to place the center at the origin and calculate accordingly.\n\n**Reflection:** Assigning coordinates directly might complicate things. Perhaps using angle measures and trigonometry is better.\n\n**Alternative Approach:** Instead of exact coordinates, use vector addition based on direction and distance.\n\n**Decision:** I\u2019ll switch to using vectors to represent each movement.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Using Vector Addition**\n\nLet\u2019s represent each side as a vector and sum them up to find Alice\u2019s final position.\n\n- **From A to B:** She moves 2 km to the right.\n- **From B to C:** She moves 2 km at an angle of 120 degrees from the previous direction.\n- **From C to D:** She moves 1 km at an angle of 120 degrees again.\n\n**Calculating Vectors:**\n\n1. **AB Vector:**\n   - Direction: Right (0 degrees)\n   - Magnitude: 2 km\n   - Vector: \\( \\mathbf{v_1} = (2, 0) \\)\n\n2. **BC Vector:**\n   - Direction: 120 degrees from AB\n   - Magnitude: 2 km\n   - Vector: \n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{v_2} = (2 \\cos 120^\\circ, 2 \\sin 120^\\circ) = (-1, \\sqrt{3})\n     \\]\n\n3. **CD Vector:**\n   - Direction: 120 degrees from BC\n   - Magnitude: 1 km\n   - Vector: \n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{v_3} = (1 \\cos 240^\\circ, 1 \\sin 240^\\circ) = (-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\n     \\]\n\n**Adding Vectors for Final Position:**\n\\[\n\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{v_1} + \\mathbf{v_2} + \\mathbf{v_3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{R} = (2 + (-1) + (-\\frac{1}{2}),\\ 0 + (\\sqrt{3}) + (-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}))\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{R} = (0.5,\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This makes sense numerically. Her position is slightly right and slightly up from the starting point A.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Distance from Starting Point**\n\nNow, compute the distance from her final position \\( \\mathbf{R} \\) back to the starting point A.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(0.5)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{0.25 + \\frac{3}{4}}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{0.25 + 0.75}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{1}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 \\text{ km}\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute:** That seems off. The possible answers are \\(\\sqrt{13}, \\sqrt{14}, \\sqrt{15}, \\sqrt{16}, \\sqrt{17}\\), and my result is 1 km, which doesn't match any options.\n\n**Reflection:** I must have made a miscalculation or misrepresentation somewhere. Let\u2019s re-examine the vectors.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Re-evaluating the Vectors**\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at how I calculated the vectors, especially the angles.\n\n**Potential Mistake:** I used angles incorrectly relative to each side. The hexagon\u2019s internal angles are 120 degrees, but perhaps I misapplied them to the vectors.\n\n**Correct Approach:** Ensure that each vector\u2019s angle is measured correctly from the previous vector\u2019s direction.\n\n**Recalculating Vectors:**\n\n1. **AB Vector:**\n   - Same as before: \\( \\mathbf{v_1} = (2, 0) \\)\n\n2. **BC Vector:**\n   - Correct angle: 60 degrees from AB (external angle)\n   - Magnitude: 2 km\n   - Vector: \n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{v_2} = (2 \\cos 60^\\circ, 2 \\sin 60^\\circ) = (1, \\sqrt{3})\n     \\]\n\n3. **CD Vector:**\n   - Correct angle: 60 degrees from BC \n   - Magnitude: 1 km\n   - Vector: \n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{v_3} = (1 \\cos 60^\\circ, 1 \\sin 60^\\circ) = (0.5, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\n     \\]\n\n**Wait, That Doesn\u2019t Seem Right:** The vectors should change directions properly according to the hexagon\u2019s angles.\n\n**Alternative Idea:** Perhaps it\u2019s better to consider the hexagon\u2019s symmetry and use trigonometric identities to find the final position.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Leveraging Hexagon Symmetry**\n\nLet\u2019s think about the symmetry of a regular hexagon. Moving along its sides for a specific distance should have predictable outcomes based on the angles.\n\n**Hexagon Angles:**\n- Each internal angle is 120 degrees.\n- Each external angle is 60 degrees.\n\n**Alice\u2019s Path:**\n- She walks 5 km: 2 km from A to B, 2 km from B to C, and 1 km along C to D.\n\n**Visualizing:** After reaching point C, she\u2019s walking halfway along side CD.\n\n**Alternative Approach:** Use the law of cosines or coordinate geometry to find the distance from her final position back to A.\n\n**Decision:** I\u2019ll proceed with assigning coordinates again but ensuring correctness this time.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Correctly Assigning Coordinates**\n\nLet\u2019s place the hexagon on a coordinate plane correctly this time.\n\n- **Center at Origin (0,0):**\n  - Each vertex is 2 km away from the center.\n  - Starting at point A, placed at (2,0).\n\n**Calculating Other Points:**\n- **Point B:** Rotate 60 degrees counterclockwise from A.\n  \\[\n  B = (2\\cos 60^\\circ, 2\\sin 60^\\circ) = (1, \\sqrt{3})\n  \\]\n- **Point C:** Another 60 degrees from B.\n  \\[\n  C = (2\\cos 120^\\circ, 2\\sin 120^\\circ) = (-1, \\sqrt{3})\n  \\]\n- **Point D:** Another 60 degrees from C.\n  \\[\n  D = (2\\cos 180^\\circ, 2\\sin 180^\\circ) = (-2, 0)\n  \\]\n- **Point E and F:** Continue similarly, but they might not be needed.\n\n**Alice\u2019s Final Position:**\n- Walks from A to B: (1, \u221a3)\n- Walks from B to C: (-1, \u221a3)\n- Walks 1 km along C to D\n\n**Calculating the Partial Walk from C to D:**\n- Side CD is 2 km long, and she walks 1 km along it, so she\u2019s halfway.\n- The vector from C to D is:\n  \\[\n  CD = D - C = (-2,0) - (-1, \\sqrt{3}) = (-1, -\\sqrt{3})\n  \\]\n- Walking 1 km along this vector (half the length):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Final position} = C + \\frac{1}{2} \\times CD = (-1, \\sqrt{3}) + \\frac{1}{2}(-1, -\\sqrt{3})\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = (-1 + (-\\frac{1}{2}), \\sqrt{3} + (-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}))\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  = (-1.5, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:** This seems more accurate. Now, let's compute the distance back to A (2,0).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Computing the Distance from Starting Point**\n\nUsing the distance formula between her final position \\((-1.5, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\) and the starting point (2,0):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(2 - (-1.5))^2 + \\left(0 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{(3.5)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{12.25 + \\frac{3}{4}}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{12.25 + 0.75}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{13}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This result matches one of the given options, \\(\\sqrt{13}\\). It seems correct now.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(\\sqrt{13}\\) kilometers.\n\n**Final Check:** Let\u2019s quickly verify if this makes sense. Walking 5 km around a hexagon with sides of 2 km means covering more than two sides. The distance back being approximately 3.6 km (\\(\\sqrt{13} \\approx 3.6\\)) seems reasonable given the geometry.\n\n**Conclusion:** After re-evaluating the initial approach and correctly applying vector addition and coordinate geometry, the distance from Alice\u2019s final position to her starting point is \\(\\sqrt{13}\\) kilometers.\n\n---\n\nThis journey through the problem reflects a natural human approach\u2014starting with initial thoughts, trying out different strategies, spotting and correcting errors, and finally arriving at the correct solution through careful reflection and recalculations.",

  "ground_truth": "We imagine this problem on a coordinate plane and let Alice's starting position be the origin. We see that she will travel along two edges and then go halfway along a third. Therefore, her new $x$-coordinate will be $1 + 2 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$ because she travels along a distance of $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1$ km because of the side relationships of an equilateral triangle, then $2$ km because the line is parallel to the $x$-axis, and the remaining distance is $\\frac{1}{2}$ km because she went halfway along and because of the logic for the first part of her route. For her $y$-coordinate, we can use similar logic to find that the coordinate is $\\sqrt{3} + 0 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} =  \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
