  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem together. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would naturally, exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed. Let's get started.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the equation given is:\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 3x^2 - 10x = 0\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis looks like a polynomial equation. I remember dealing with similar cubic equations before. Maybe factoring could work here. But honestly, I\u2019m not entirely sure\u2014it might need another approach. Let\u2019s brainstorm a bit.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Factoring Out Common Terms:**  \n   I notice all terms have an \\( x \\). Maybe factoring \\( x \\) out could simplify things.\n\n2. **Using the Quadratic Formula:**  \n   If factoring works, perhaps it\u2019ll reduce to a quadratic equation, and I can use the quadratic formula.\n\n3. **Graphical Approach:**  \n   Visualizing the equation might help identify the roots, especially to estimate the mean of the solutions.\n\n4. **Synthetic Division:**  \n   If I find one root, I could use synthetic division to simplify the equation further.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nFactoring out the common term seems the most straightforward to start with. If that doesn\u2019t work, I can try other methods.\n\n### **Step 1: Factoring Out Common Terms**\n\nLet's attempt to factor \\( x \\) out of the equation.\n\n\\[\nx(x^2 + 3x - 10) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFactoring out \\( x \\) leaves me with a quadratic equation inside the parentheses. This is promising because solving \\( x = 0 \\) is straightforward, and I can focus on the quadratic part next.\n\n**Checking Work:**  \nDoes multiplying back give the original equation?\n\n\\[\nx \\cdot (x^2) + x \\cdot (3x) - x \\cdot (10) = x^3 + 3x^2 - 10x\n\\]\n\nYes, it matches. So, factoring is correct.\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Factored Equation**\n\nNow, we have:\n\n\\[\nx(x^2 + 3x - 10) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis means:\n\n\\[\nx = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x^2 + 3x - 10 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nGreat, I\u2019ve already found one solution: \\( x = 0 \\). Now, I need to solve the quadratic equation to find the other solutions.\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\nLet\u2019s focus on:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 3x - 10 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \nI can attempt factoring, but if that\u2019s tricky, the quadratic formula is a surefire method.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quadratic Formula: } x = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 3 \\), and \\( c = -10 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = 3^2 - 4(1)(-10) = 9 + 40 = 49\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}}{2(1)} = \\frac{{-3 \\pm 7}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Solutions:**  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-3 + 7}}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-3 - 7}}{2} = \\frac{{-10}}{2} = -5\n\\]\n\n**Checking Work:**  \nLet\u2019s quickly verify by plugging these back into the original quadratic equation.\n\n- For \\( x = 2 \\):\n  \\[\n  2^2 + 3(2) - 10 = 4 + 6 - 10 = 0\n  \\]\n  \u2705 Correct!\n\n- For \\( x = -5 \\):\n  \\[\n  (-5)^2 + 3(-5) - 10 = 25 - 15 - 10 = 0\n  \\]\n  \u2705 Correct!\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth solutions satisfy the quadratic equation. So, the solutions are \\( x = 0 \\), \\( x = 2 \\), and \\( x = -5 \\).\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Mean of All Solutions**\n\nNow, we need to find the mean (average) of all the solutions.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{{0 + 2 + (-5)}}{3} = \\frac{{-3}}{3} = -1\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAdding up the solutions:\n\n\\[\n0 + 2 - 5 = -3\n\\]\n\nDivide by the number of solutions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{{-3}}{3} = -1\n\\]\n\n**Checking Work:**  \nDoes this make sense?  \nIntuitively, the mean of a positive and a negative number that are equidistant from zero should lean towards the larger magnitude, which it does here. So, it seems correct.\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nEverything checks out. By factoring the original equation, solving the resulting quadratic, and verifying each step, the mean of all solutions is confidently determined.\n\n<ANSWER>solution</ANSWER>\n\n**<ANSWER>-1</ANSWER>**\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Factored** the original equation to find one solution immediately.\n- **Solved** the resulting quadratic equation for the other two solutions.\n- **Verified** each solution by plugging them back into the original equation.\n- **Calculated** the mean of all solutions to arrive at the final answer.\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step walkthrough captures the natural thought process, including brainstorming, checking, and reflecting at each stage. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",
  "ground_truth": "First, we factor the equation as $x(x^2 +3x - 10) = 0$.  So, one solution is $x=0$ and the other two solutions are the solutions to $x^2 + 3x-10=0$.  We could either factor the quadratic, or note that the sum of the solutions to this quadratic is $-(3/1)=-3$, so the mean of the three solutions to the original equation is $-3/3=\\boxed{-1}$."
