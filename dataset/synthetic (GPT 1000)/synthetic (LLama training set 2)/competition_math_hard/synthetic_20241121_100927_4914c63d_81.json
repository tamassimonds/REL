  "problem": "How many positive whole numbers have cube roots that are less than $10$? For example, $20$ would count since $\\sqrt[3]{20}<10.$",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let\u2019s consolidate the original brainstorming into a polished, coherent solution while preserving the reflective approach. Here's how we can do it:\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to determine how many positive whole numbers have cube roots less than 10. At first glance, this involves cube roots and inequalities. Different strategies come to mind, such as computing cube roots directly, using inequalities, or thinking in terms of cubes.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**1. Compute Cube Roots Directly**\n\n   - **Thought:** Calculate \\(\\sqrt[3]{n}\\) for each number.\n   - **Reflection:** This is practical for small numbers but inefficient for larger ranges. It\u2019s not the best approach here.\n\n**2. Use Inequalities**\n\n   - **Thought:** Set up the inequality \\(\\sqrt[3]{n} < 10\\).\n   - **Action:** Cube both sides to eliminate the cube root:\n     \\[\n     n < 10^3 = 1000\n     \\]\n   - **Reflection:** This transformation simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n**3. Think in Terms of Cubes**\n\n   - **Thought:** Recognize that if the cube root of \\(n\\) is less than 10, then \\(n\\) must be less than \\(10^3\\).\n   - **Reflection:** Confirms that \\(n < 1000\\) is the correct range.\n\n**Decision:** Using inequalities is the most efficient method.\n\n---\n\n### **Solving the Problem**\n\nBy cubing both sides of the inequality \\(\\sqrt[3]{n} < 10\\), we get \\(n < 1000\\). This means all positive whole numbers less than 1000 satisfy the condition.\n\n\\[\nn = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 999\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:** There are 999 numbers in total.\n\n---\n\n### **Validating the Approach**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Lower Bound:** \n  - For \\(n = 1\\), \\(\\sqrt[3]{1} = 1 < 10\\) \u2014 **Valid**\n- **Upper Bound:** \n  - For \\(n = 999\\), \\(\\sqrt[3]{999} \\approx 9.997 < 10\\) \u2014 **Valid**\n- **Exceeding Bound:** \n  - For \\(n = 1000\\), \\(\\sqrt[3]{1000} = 10\\) \u2014 **Not less than 10**\n\n**Reflection:** These checks confirm that our inequality \\(n < 1000\\) accurately captures all numbers whose cube roots are less than 10.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>999</ANSWER>\n\nThere are **999** positive whole numbers whose cube roots are less than 10.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion and Reflection**\n\nBy transforming the inequality \\(\\sqrt[3]{n} < 10\\) into \\(n < 1000\\), we efficiently identified the range of numbers that satisfy the condition. This approach avoided the tedious process of calculating individual cube roots and ensured accuracy through quick boundary checks. The step-by-step reflection helped validate each stage of the problem-solving process, leading to a confident and correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nAll positive whole numbers from 1 to 999 have cube roots less than 10, as verified by both lower and upper bound checks. Therefore, the solution is complete and accurate.\n\n---\n\nBy organizing the thought process into clear steps\u2014understanding the problem, exploring strategies, solving, validating, and concluding\u2014we ensure that the solution is both efficient and error-free.",
  "ground_truth": "The cube root of 1000 is 10; the cube root of any number smaller than 1000 is less than 10.  So, the whole numbers from 1 to 999 are the only positive whole numbers with cube roots less than 10.  There are $\\boxed{999}$ such numbers."
