    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, making sure to explore different strategies, reflect, and check my work along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem gives us a quadratic equation:  \n\\[ 2x^2 - mx + n = 0 \\]  \nwith roots that **sum to 6** and **multiply to 10**. We need to find the value of \\( m + n \\).\n\nImmediately, this reminds me of Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. But before jumping in, let me brainstorm different approaches to ensure I fully understand the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Vieta's Formulas:**  \n   - From what I recall, for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the sum of the roots is \\( -\\frac{b}{a} \\) and the product is \\( \\frac{c}{a} \\). This seems directly applicable here.\n\n2. **Factoring the Quadratic:**  \n   - Another approach could be to express the quadratic in its factored form:  \n     \\[ a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0 \\]  \n     But since we only know the sum and product of the roots, this might lead back to Vieta's anyway.\n\n3. **Using a Specific Example:**  \n   - Perhaps assume specific values for the roots that fit the given sum and product, then see how that affects \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\n4. **Exploring Graphically:**  \n   - Consider what the graph of the quadratic looks like with the given root properties, but this seems less straightforward for finding \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nGiven these options, **Vieta's Formulas** seem the most direct and efficient method. Let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Vieta's Formulas**\n\n**Sum of the Roots:**  \nAccording to Vieta\u2019s, the sum of the roots \\( r_1 + r_2 \\) is:  \n\\[ r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{b}{a} = -\\frac{-m}{2} = \\frac{m}{2} \\]  \nWe're given that this sum is 6:  \n\\[ \\frac{m}{2} = 6 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis equation is straightforward. Solving for \\( m \\) should be simple.\n\n**Solving for \\( m \\):**  \n\\[ m = 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIf \\( \\frac{m}{2} = 6 \\), then \\( m = 12 \\). That seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Product of the Roots**\n\n**Product of the Roots:**  \nAgain, using Vieta\u2019s:  \n\\[ r_1 \\times r_2 = \\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{n}{2} \\]  \nWe're given that this product is 10:  \n\\[ \\frac{n}{2} = 10 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis is also a straightforward linear equation. Solving for \\( n \\) should be direct.\n\n**Solving for \\( n \\):**  \n\\[ n = 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIf \\( \\frac{n}{2} = 10 \\), then \\( n = 20 \\). That checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating \\( m + n \\)**\n\nNow that we have both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\):  \n\\[ m + n = 12 + 20 = 32 \\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**  \nEverything seems to align perfectly. The sum of the roots leads us to \\( m = 12 \\), and the product leads us to \\( n = 20 \\). Adding them gives us \\( m + n = 32 \\).\n\n**Final Check:**  \n- **Sum of Roots:** \\( \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Product of Roots:** \\( \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, confirming that our solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>32</ANSWER>\n\n**Summary:**  \nBy applying Vieta\u2019s formulas to the given quadratic equation, we determined that \\( m = 12 \\) and \\( n = 20 \\). Thus, the value of \\( m + n \\) is **32**.",

  "ground_truth": "In the quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$, the roots sum to $\\frac{-b}{a}$ and multiply to $\\frac{c}{a}$. Therefore, in the equation $2x^2-mx+n=0$, the roots sum to $\\frac{m}{2}=6$ and multiply to $\\frac{n}{2}=10$. Solving the first equation, we see that $m=12$ and solving the second equation, we see that $n=20$. Therefore, $m+n=12+20=\\boxed{32}$."
