  "solution": "### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. We're tasked with finding the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that there exist positive real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) satisfying:\n\n\\[\n(a + bi)^n = (a - bi)^n\n\\]\n\nUltimately, we need to compute \\( \\frac{b}{a} \\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- This involves complex numbers, hinting at properties like conjugates or Euler\u2019s formula.\n- Maybe analyzing magnitudes and arguments could help.\n- Binomial expansion might be useful to equate real and imaginary parts.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure yet. Let's brainstorm different strategies to see what works.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Euler's Formula Approach:**\n   - Expressing complex numbers in exponential form.\n\n2. **Magnitude and Argument Analysis:**\n   - Examining the magnitudes and angles of both sides.\n\n3. **Expanding Using Binomial Theorem:**\n   - Expanding both sides and equating real and imaginary parts.\n\n4. **Alternative Strategy: Using Complex Conjugates:**\n   - Leveraging properties of conjugates to simplify the equation.\n\n**Exploring the First Strategy: Euler's Formula**\n\nLet's try using Euler\u2019s formula:\n\n\\[\na + bi = re^{i\\theta} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a - bi = re^{-i\\theta}\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(re^{i\\theta})^n = (re^{-i\\theta})^n \\implies r^n e^{in\\theta} = r^n e^{-in\\theta}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\ne^{in\\theta} = e^{-in\\theta}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute\u2014this implies that \\( in\\theta \\) must be zero, leading to \\( \\theta = 0 \\). But if \\( \\theta = 0 \\), then \\( b = 0 \\), which contradicts the requirement for positive \\( b \\).\n\n**Checking for Mistakes:**\n\nThis can't be right because it suggests \\( b = 0 \\), which isn't allowed. So, Euler\u2019s formula isn't helpful here.\n\n<ANSWER>Euler's formula doesn't work because it implies \\( b = 0 \\).</ANSWER>\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nEuler's formula approach doesn't work. Let's backtrack and try a different strategy.\n\n### **Second Strategy: Magnitude and Argument Analysis**\n\n**Thinking About Magnitudes:**\n\nFor any complex number \\( z \\), the magnitude is \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). So,\n\n\\[\n|a + bi| = |a - bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Second:**\n\nThe magnitudes are already equal regardless of \\( n \\), so no new information there. This doesn't help us find \\( n \\) or \\( \\frac{b}{a} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFocusing only on magnitudes isn't sufficient because the original equation involves raising to the power \\( n \\), which affects the angles.\n\n<ANSWER>Magnitude analysis doesn't provide new insights.</ANSWER>\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMagnitude and argument analysis aren't enough. Let's proceed to another approach.\n\n### **Third Strategy: Expanding Using Binomial Theorem**\n\n**Proceeding with Binomial Expansion:**\n\nLet's expand both sides using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + bi)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} (bi)^k\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(a - bi)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} (-bi)^k\n\\]\n\n**Equating Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n\nSince both expressions are equal, their corresponding real and imaginary components must be equal.\n\n**Setting Up Equations:**\n\n1. **Real Part Equality:** Terms where \\( k \\) is even are identical on both sides.\n2. **Imaginary Part Equality:** Terms where \\( k \\) is odd must satisfy:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k \\text{ odd}} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k i^k = -\\sum_{k \\text{ odd}} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k i^k\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k \\text{ odd}} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k i^k = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis is promising because it leads to a condition on \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n<ANSWER>This strategy works\u2014binomial expansion leads to a useful condition.</ANSWER>\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBinomial expansion is effective. Let's continue with this approach to find \\( n \\) and \\( \\frac{b}{a} \\).\n\n### **Next Steps: Finding \\( n \\) by Trial and Error**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- We'll test small values of \\( n \\) to identify the smallest integer that satisfies the condition.\n- Once \\( n \\) is found, we'll compute \\( \\frac{b}{a} \\).\n\n**Starting with \\( n = 1 \\):**\n\n\\[\n(a + bi)^1 = (a - bi)^1 \\implies a + bi = a - bi\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nb = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis contradicts the requirement for positive \\( b \\). So, \\( n = 1 \\) doesn't work.\n\n<ANSWER>\\( n = 1 \\) doesn't work because it implies \\( b = 0 \\).</ANSWER>\n\n**Proceeding to \\( n = 2 \\):**\n\n\\[\n(a + bi)^2 = (a - bi)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[\na^2 + 2abi - b^2 = a^2 - 2abi - b^2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n4abi = -4abi \\implies b = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAgain, \\( b = 0 \\) is not acceptable. So, \\( n = 2 \\) doesn't work either.\n\n<ANSWER>\\( n = 2 \\) doesn't work because it also implies \\( b = 0 \\).</ANSWER>\n\n**Checking \\( n = 3 \\):**\n\n\\[\n(a + bi)^3 = (a - bi)^3\n\\]\n\n**Expanding Both Sides:**\n\n\\[\n(a^3 - 3ab^2) + (3a^2b - b^3)i = (a^3 - 3ab^2) - (3a^2b - b^3)i\n\\]\n\n**Equating Imaginary Parts:**\n\n\\[\n(3a^2b - b^3)i = -(3a^2b - b^3)i \\implies 3a^2b - b^3 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Factoring Out \\( b \\):**\n\n\\[\nb(3a^2 - b^2) = 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\( b \\neq 0 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n3a^2 - b^2 = 0 \\implies b^2 = 3a^2 \\implies \\frac{b}{a} = \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis works! For \\( n = 3 \\), we find that \\( \\frac{b}{a} = \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\n<ANSWER>\\( n = 3 \\) works, yielding \\( \\frac{b}{a} = \\sqrt{3} \\).</ANSWER>\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe smallest positive integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( n = 3 \\), and \\( \\frac{b}{a} = \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:** Euler's formula didn't work because it led to \\( b = 0 \\), violating the condition of positive \\( b \\).\n- **Magnitude Analysis:** Provided no new insights as magnitudes were inherently equal.\n- **Binomial Expansion:** Successfully equated real and imaginary parts, leading us to the correct relationship between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n- **Trial and Error:** Testing \\( n = 3 \\) yielded a valid solution, confirming \\( \\frac{b}{a} = \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\n<FINAL_ANSWER>\\(\\frac{b}{a} = \\sqrt{3}\\)</FINAL_ANSWER>\n\n### **Alternate Strategy: Using Complex Conjugates Without Expansion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Perhaps there's a simpler way by considering the properties of complex conjugates.\n- Given that \\( (a + bi) \\) and \\( (a - bi) \\) are conjugates, raising them to the same power resulting in equality suggests specific conditions on \\( n \\).\n\n**Rewriting the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(a + bi)^n}{(a - bi)^n} = 1\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{a + bi}{a - bi}\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\nz^n = 1\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying \\( z \\):**\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{a + bi}{a - bi} \\times \\frac{a + bi}{a + bi} = \\frac{(a + bi)^2}{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\n\nNumerator:\n\n\\[\n(a + bi)^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 2abi\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{a^2 - b^2 + 2abi}{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\n\n**Analyzing \\( z^n = 1 \\):**\n\nThis implies that \\( z \\) is an \\( n \\)-th root of unity, meaning that the argument of \\( z \\) must be a multiple of \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{n} \\).\n\n**Calculating the Argument of \\( z \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\text{arg}(z) = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2ab}{a^2 - b^2}\\right) = \\frac{2k\\pi}{n}\n\\]\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2ab}{a^2 - b^2}\\right) = \\frac{2k\\pi}{n}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis approach leads to a more complicated equation, which doesn't immediately help in finding \\( n \\) and \\( \\frac{b}{a} \\).
