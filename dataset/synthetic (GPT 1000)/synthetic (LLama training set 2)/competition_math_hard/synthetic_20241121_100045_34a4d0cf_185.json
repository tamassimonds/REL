  "problem": "For what value of $c$ will the circle with equation $x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 4y + c = 0$ have a radius of length 4?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through like we naturally would when tackling a math question.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question is asking for the value of \\( c \\) that makes a given circle's radius exactly 4. The equation provided is:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 6x + y^2 - 4y + c = 0\n\\]\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- This looks like the general form of a circle's equation. I remember that the standard form involves completing the square.\n- Completing the square might help me rewrite the equation to identify the circle's center and radius.\n- Alternatively, I could try to recall formulas that relate the coefficients directly to the radius, but I'm not sure if that's straightforward here.\n- Hmm, let's start with completing the square since it seems like the most direct method to find the radius.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Completing the Square**\n\n- **Thought Process:** By completing the square for both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) terms, I can rewrite the equation in the standard circle form \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\), which will make it easier to identify the radius.\n  \n- **Reflection:** This should work because once we have the equation in standard form, comparing it to \\( r^2 = 16 \\) (since the radius is 4) will allow us to solve for \\( c \\).\n\n**Strategy 2: Using the General Circle Formula**\n\n- **Thought Process:** There's a formula that relates the coefficients in the general circle equation to the radius. Maybe I can use that directly.\n  \n- **Reflection:** But wait, I don't recall the exact formula, and it might be more complicated than necessary. Perhaps sticking to completing the square is more straightforward.\n\n**Decision:** Let's proceed with **Strategy 1: Completing the Square**.\n\n### **Completing the Square**\n\n**Step 1: Completing the Square for \\( x \\)**\n\nEquation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 6x\n\\]\n\n- **Thought Process:** I need to make this a perfect square. Recall that for \\( x^2 + bx \\), adding and subtracting \\(\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2\\) completes the square.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - \\( b = 6 \\)\n  - \\(\\left(\\frac{6}{2}\\right)^2 = 9\\)\n  \n- **Writing it Out:**\n  \n  \\[\n  x^2 + 6x = (x + 3)^2 - 9\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Does expanding \\((x + 3)^2 - 9\\) give back \\( x^2 + 6x \\)? Yes, it does.\n\n**Step 2: Completing the Square for \\( y \\)**\n\nEquation:\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 4y\n\\]\n\n- **Thought Process:** Apply the same method as with \\( x \\).\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - \\( b = -4 \\)\n  - \\(\\left(\\frac{-4}{2}\\right)^2 = 4\\)\n  \n- **Writing it Out:**\n  \n  \\[\n  y^2 - 4y = (y - 2)^2 - 4\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Expanding \\((y - 2)^2 - 4\\) returns \\( y^2 - 4y \\). Perfect!\n\n**Step 3: Rewriting the Original Equation**\n\nSubstitute the completed squares back into the original equation:\n\n\\[\n(x + 3)^2 - 9 + (y - 2)^2 - 4 + c = 0\n\\]\n\n- **Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n(x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 13 + c = 0\n\\]\n\n- **Thought Process:** I need to isolate the squared terms on one side to match the standard circle equation.\n\n- **Rearranging:**\n\n\\[\n(x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 13 - c\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This looks good. The left side represents the squared distances from the center, and the right side should equal the square of the radius.\n\n### **Connecting to the Desired Radius**\n\nGiven that the radius \\( r = 4 \\), we know:\n\n\\[\nr^2 = 16\n\\]\n\n- **Setting Up the Equation:**\n\n\\[\n13 - c = 16\n\\]\n\n- **Thought Process:** Solve for \\( c \\) to ensure the right side equals \\( 16 \\).\n\n### **Solving for \\( c \\)**\n\n\\[\n13 - c = 16\n\\]\n\n- **Isolating \\( c \\):**\n\n\\[\n-c = 16 - 13 \\\\\n-c = 3 \\\\\nc = -3\n\\]\n\n- **Check:** Plugging \\( c = -3 \\) back into the equation:\n\n  \\[\n  (x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 16\n  \\]\n  \n  Which corresponds to a radius of 4. So, it checks out!\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\nEverything seems to align correctly. Completing the square allowed us to transform the original equation into the standard circle form, making it straightforward to determine the necessary value of \\( c \\).\n\n<ANSWER>c = -3</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Thoughts and Verification**\n\n- **Alternative Strategy Reflection:** Initially, I considered using a direct formula to relate the coefficients to the radius, but completing the square proved to be more intuitive and reliable.\n\n- **Verification:** By substituting \\( c = -3 \\) back into the equation, the radius indeed comes out to be 4, confirming the correctness of the solution.\n\n- **Final Check:** All steps logically follow, and no discrepancies were found during the process.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** Through a step-by-step approach, primarily utilizing completing the square, we've determined that the value of \\( c \\) must be \\(-3\\) for the circle to have a radius of 4.",
  "ground_truth": "Completing the square gives us $(x+3)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 13 - c$. Since we want the radius to be 4, we must have $13 - c = 4^2$. It follows that $c = \\boxed{-3}$."
