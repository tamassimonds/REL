  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like how a human brain would naturally process it. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, checking each one, and reflecting along the way to ensure correctness. If something doesn't work, I'll adjust my approach. Finally, I'll consolidate everything into a coherent and complete solution.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n- **Given:** Positive integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(x \\neq y\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{12}\\).\n- **Objective:** Find the smallest possible value for \\(x + y\\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\n- This looks like a problem involving reciprocals. Reminds me of harmonic expressions.\n- **Brainstorming:** Maybe I can use algebra to combine the fractions. Alternatively, perhaps setting up an equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other could work.\n- **But Wait:** Since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers and distinct, there might be a finite set of possibilities to check.\n\nLet me explore different strategies to see which one fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Algebraic Manipulation**\n\n**Step 1: Combine the Fractions**\n\n- I know that adding fractions requires a common denominator. So, let's combine \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{y}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{y + x}{xy} = \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- This simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x + y}{xy} = \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Cross-Multiply to Eliminate the Denominator**\n\n- Cross-multiplying to get rid of the fractions:\n\n\\[\n12(x + y) = xy\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** This looks like a quadratic equation in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). I think I can rearrange it.\n\n**Step 3: Rearrange the Equation**\n\n- Rewrite the equation:\n\n\\[\nxy - 12x - 12y = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thinking:**\n\n- This resembles a quadratic equation, but with two variables. Perhaps factoring can help.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Factoring the Equation**\n\n**Step 4: Attempt to Factor**\n\n- Let\u2019s try to factor the equation. It kind of looks like it can be rearranged into a product of binomials.\n\n\\[\n(x - a)(y - b) = c\n\\]\n\n- **Actually:** I remember that factoring quadratics involving two variables can be tricky. Maybe setting it up differently would help.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Hmm:** I'm not sure if straightforward factoring will work here. Perhaps substituting one variable in terms of the other might be better.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Expressing One Variable in Terms of the Other**\n\n**Step 5: Solve for One Variable**\n\n- Let's solve for \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nxy - 12x - 12y = 0 \\implies y(x - 12) = 12x \\implies y = \\frac{12x}{x - 12}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Since \\(y\\) must be a positive integer, \\(x - 12\\) must divide \\(12x\\) evenly. Also, \\(x \\neq 12\\) to avoid division by zero.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Interesting:** This gives me a relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). I can now look for integer solutions where \\(x \\neq y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 4: Finding Integer Solutions**\n\n**Step 6: Plug in Values for \\(x\\) to Find Corresponding \\(y\\)**\n\n- Since we're looking for the smallest \\(x + y\\), I'll start with the smallest possible \\(x\\) greater than 12 (since \\(x = 12\\) would make the denominator zero).\n\n**Trying \\(x = 13\\):**\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{12 \\times 13}{13 - 12} = \\frac{156}{1} = 156\n\\]\n\n- So, \\(x = 13\\), \\(y = 156\\), and \\(x + y = 169\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait:** That sum seems quite large. Maybe there's a smaller pair. Perhaps I should try a different approach to minimize \\(x + y\\).\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Hmm:** Starting with \\(x\\) just above 12 yields a large \\(y\\). Maybe I need to consider another method to ensure I'm finding the smallest possible sum.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 5: Rewriting the Equation for Easier Solving**\n\n**Step 7: Revisit the Original Equation**\n\n- Let's go back to the equation:\n\n\\[\nxy - 12x - 12y = 0\n\\]\n\n- **Complete the Square Approach:** Maybe I can add 144 to both sides to factor it neatly.\n\n\\[\nxy - 12x - 12y + 144 = 144\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(x - 12)(y - 12) = 144\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** This looks good because now I have a product of two terms equal to 144. I can find integer pairs \\((x - 12)\\) and \\((y - 12)\\) whose product is 144.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Aha Moment:** This transformation makes it much easier to find integer solutions. Now I can list all factor pairs of 144 and find corresponding \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 6: Listing Factor Pairs of 144**\n\n**Step 8: Identify Factor Pairs of 144**\n\n- Let's list the pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(a \\cdot b = 144\\), and set \\(x - 12 = a\\) and \\(y - 12 = b\\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(1, 144) &\\Rightarrow (x, y) = (13, 156) \\\\\n(2, 72) &\\Rightarrow (x, y) = (14, 84) \\\\\n(3, 48) &\\Rightarrow (x, y) = (15, 60) \\\\\n(4, 36) &\\Rightarrow (x, y) = (16, 48) \\\\\n(6, 24) &\\Rightarrow (x, y) = (18, 36) \\\\\n(8, 18) &\\Rightarrow (x, y) = (20, 30) \\\\\n(9, 16) &\\Rightarrow (x, y) = (21, 28) \\\\\n(12, 12) &\\Rightarrow (x, y) = (24, 24) \\text{ (Invalid since } x \\neq y) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- **Looking Good:** These pairs give us possible values for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Now, let's find the pair with the smallest \\(x + y\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** I need to ensure that \\(x \\neq y\\), so the pair \\((12, 12)\\) is invalid.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 7: Determining the Smallest \\(x + y\\)**\n\n**Step 9: Calculate \\(x + y\\) for Each Valid Pair**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(13, 156) &\\Rightarrow x + y = 169 \\\\\n(14, 84) &\\Rightarrow x + y = 98 \\\\\n(15, 60) &\\Rightarrow x + y = 75 \\\\\n(16, 48) &\\Rightarrow x + y = 64 \\\\\n(18, 36) &\\Rightarrow x + y = 54 \\\\\n(20, 30) &\\Rightarrow x + y = 50 \\\\\n(21, 28) &\\Rightarrow x + y = 49 \\\\\n(24, 24) &\\Rightarrow x + y = 48 \\text{ (Invalid)} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** The smallest valid sum is \\(49\\) from the pair \\((21, 28)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Final Check:** This seems correct. The pair \\((21, 28)\\) satisfies all conditions: \\(x \\neq y\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{12}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies and carefully analyzing each step, we find that the smallest possible value for \\(x + y\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{49}\n\\]\n\n- **With:** \\(x = 21\\) and \\(y = 28\\).\n\n**Final Thoughts and Verification:**\n\n- **Verification:** Let's verify that \\(\\frac{1}{21} + \\frac{1}{28} = \\frac{1}{12}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{21} + \\frac{1}{28} = \\frac{28 + 21}{588} = \\frac{49}{588} = \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\n- **Check Passed:** The solution is correct.\n\n**Overall Approach:**\n\n- Starting with algebraic manipulation led to expressing one variable in terms of the other.\n- Factoring the equation simplified the problem, allowing us to list integer solutions easily.\n- Checking each step ensured accuracy, leading to the correct and minimal solution.\n\n**Final Verification:**\n\n- By revisiting each step and confirming the calculations, the solution is validated. The smallest possible value for \\(x + y\\) is indeed \\(49\\).\n\n---\n\nThat's it! By exploring multiple strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying the solution, we arrived at the correct answer while emulating a natural human problem-solving process.",
  "ground_truth": "Simplifying, we have  $12(x+y)=xy$, so $xy - 12x - 12y = 0.$ Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by adding 144 to both sides, we get $xy-12x-12y +144=144$, so \\[(x-12)(y-12)=144.\\]Now we seek the minimal $x+y,$ which occurs when $x-12$ and $y-12$ are as close to each other in value as possible. The two best candidates are $(x-12,y-12)=(18,8)$ or $(16,9),$ of which $(x,y)=(28,21)$ attains the minimum sum of $\\boxed{49}$."
