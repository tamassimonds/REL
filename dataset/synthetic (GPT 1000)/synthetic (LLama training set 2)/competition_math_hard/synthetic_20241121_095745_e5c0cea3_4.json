  "solution": "### **Understanding the Question**\n\nLet's dive into solving the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\n11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to complete the square and find the constants \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) in the equation \\((x + r)^2 = s\\), ultimately determining \\(r + s\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Completing the Square:** This technique transforms a quadratic equation into a perfect square form, making it easier to solve.\n- **Coefficients Matter:** With a leading coefficient of 11, completing the square directly might be tricky.\n- **Exploring Strategies:** Factoring out the leading coefficient could simplify the process.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Completing the Square Directly:** Attempting to adjust the quadratic term as is.\n2. **Factoring Out Coefficients:** Simplifying the equation by factoring out the leading coefficient.\n3. **Using the Quadratic Formula:** An alternative approach, though indirect for this purpose.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\nGiven the complexity added by the leading coefficient, **Strategy 2**\u2014factoring out the coefficient\u2014seems the most practical starting point. If this doesn't work, we can reassess.\n\n### **Step 1: Factoring Out the Leading Coefficient**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Simplification:** By factoring out 11, the equation inside the parentheses becomes easier to handle.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n11(x^2 - 4x - 9) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Easier to Manage:** Now, the quadratic expression is simpler, making completing the square more straightforward.\n\n### **Step 2: Completing the Square Inside the Parentheses**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Forming a Perfect Square:** We need to transform \\(x^2 - 4x - 9\\) into \\((x - h)^2 - k\\).\n\n**Calculation Steps:**\n\n1. **Identify \\(b\\):** The coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(-4\\).\n2. **Compute \\((\\frac{b}{2})^2\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{-4}{2}\\right)^2 = 4\n\\]\n\n3. **Add and Subtract 4 Inside:**\n\n\\[\n11(x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4 - 9) = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n11((x - 2)^2 - 13) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Verification:** Expanding \\((x - 2)^2\\) yields \\(x^2 - 4x + 4\\), so subtracting 13 maintains the balance. This confirms the step is correct.\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Distributing 11:** Multiply back to isolate the perfect square term.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n11((x - 2)^2 - 13) = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n11(x - 2)^2 - 143 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Isolated Square Term:** The equation now highlights the perfect square, aligning with our goal.\n\n### **Step 4: Rearranging to the Desired Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Isolating \\((x - 2)^2\\):** Add 143 to both sides to match \\((x + r)^2 = s\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n11(x - 2)^2 = 143\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 = \\frac{143}{11}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Desired Form Achieved:** The equation is now in the perfect square format, making it easy to identify \\(r\\) and \\(s\\).\n\n### **Step 5: Identifying \\(r\\) and \\(s\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Comparing Forms:** Match \\((x - 2)^2 = \\frac{143}{11}\\) to \\((x + r)^2 = s\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nr = -2\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{143}{11}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n\\[\nr + s = -2 + \\frac{143}{11} = -\\frac{22}{11} + \\frac{143}{11} = \\frac{121}{11} = 11\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Correct Addition:** Converting \\(-2\\) to \\(-\\frac{22}{11}\\) ensures accurate addition, confirming that \\(r + s = 11\\).\n\n### **Step 6: Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Confirming Solution:** Substituting back into the original equation to ensure correctness.\n\n**Substitution:**\n\n- **Roots Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nx = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{143}{11}}\n\\]\n\n- **Substituting Back:**\n\n\\[\n11\\left(2 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{143}{11}}\\right)^2 - 44\\left(2 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{143}{11}}\\right) - 99 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Cumbersome but Correct:** Although substitution is complex, the steps leading to this point are verified, indicating the solution is valid.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER> \nr + s = 11 \n</ANSWER>\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Effective Strategy:** Factoring out the leading coefficient simplified the completing square process.\n- **Verification Ensures Accuracy:** Each step was carefully checked to confirm correctness.\n- **Robust Solution:** By reflecting and verifying throughout, the final answer is confidently determined as \\(r + s = 11\\).",
  "ground_truth": "Dividing both sides of the equation $11x^2-44x-99$ by $11$, we have $$x^2-4x-9 = 0.$$The square which agrees with $x^2-4x-9$ except for the constant term is $(x-2)^2$, which is equal to $x^2-4x+4$ and thus to $(x^2-4x-9)+13$.\n\nTherefore, by adding $13$ to each side, Krzysztof rewrote the equation $x^2-4x-9 = 0$ as $$(x-2)^2 = 13$$We have $r=-2$, $s=13$, and thus $r+s=\\boxed{11}$."
