  "solution": "### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. We have a convex pentagon \\(ABCDE\\) with specific angle properties:\n\n- Angles \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are congruent.\n- Angles \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) are congruent.\n- The measure of angle \\(A\\) is 40 degrees less than the measure of angle \\(D\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nHmm, so we're dealing with a pentagon where some angles are equal, and there's a relationship between angles \\(A\\) and \\(D\\). This reminds me of problems involving the sum of interior angles and setting up equations based on congruence. I think I\u2019ll need to use the fact that the sum of all interior angles in a pentagon is a specific value.\n\n**Possible Approaches:**\n\n1. **Sum of Interior Angles:** Use the total sum of interior angles for a pentagon to set up an equation.\n   \n2. **Assign Variables:** Assign variables to the congruent angles and set up equations based on the given relationships.\n\n3. **Substitution Method:** Use substitution to express one angle in terms of another.\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies:**\n\nI think starting with the sum of interior angles makes sense. If that doesn\u2019t work, I can try assigning variables and setting up equations accordingly.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Sum of Interior Angles\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with the first strategy.\n\n**Sum of Interior Angles in a Pentagon:**\n\n\\[\n(5 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, so the total sum of all interior angles in a pentagon is \\(540^\\circ\\). This will be useful for setting up our equations.\n\n### Step 3: Assigning Variables\n\nNow, let's assign variables to the angles based on the given information.\n\n- Let\u2019s say the measure of angles \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) is \\(x\\).\n- Angles \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) are congruent, so let\u2019s assign them \\(y\\).\n- We're also told that angle \\(A\\) is 40 degrees less than angle \\(D\\): \n  \\[\n  x = y - 40^\\circ\n  \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBy assigning variables, I can create equations that relate all the angles. This should help me find the values I need.\n\n### Step 4: Setting Up the Equation\n\nUsing the sum of all angles:\n\n\\[\nA + B + C + D + E = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the variables:\n\n\\[\nx + x + x + y + y = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n3x + 2y = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis equation looks correct. I've accounted for all the angles and their congruences. Now, I need to incorporate the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n### Step 5: Incorporating the Given Relationship\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\n\\[\nx = y - 40^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Substitution:**\n\nLet\u2019s substitute \\(x\\) in the equation \\(3x + 2y = 540^\\circ\\):\n\n\\[\n3(y - 40^\\circ) + 2y = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n3y - 120^\\circ + 2y = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n5y - 120^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\nAdding \\(120^\\circ\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\n5y = 660^\\circ\n\\]\n\nDividing by 5:\n\n\\[\ny = 132^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nWait a second\u2026 Let me think if this makes sense. If \\(y = 132^\\circ\\), then angle \\(D\\) is \\(132^\\circ\\), and angle \\(A\\) should be \\(132^\\circ - 40^\\circ = 92^\\circ\\). Let's verify by plugging back into the original equation.\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the Solution\n\nCalculate \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = y - 40^\\circ = 132^\\circ - 40^\\circ = 92^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, check the sum:\n\n\\[\n3x + 2y = 3(92^\\circ) + 2(132^\\circ) = 276^\\circ + 264^\\circ = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe sum is \\(540^\\circ\\), which matches the total sum of interior angles for a pentagon. This confirms that our solution is correct.\n\n### Step 7: Final Answer\n\n<ANSWER>\n\\[\n\\text{The measure of angle } D \\text{ is } 132^\\circ.\n\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy assigning variables to the congruent angles, setting up an equation based on the sum of interior angles, and incorporating the given relationship between angles \\(A\\) and \\(D\\), we successfully determined that the measure of angle \\(D\\) is \\(132^\\circ\\). Throughout the process, regular checks ensured the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nThis approach was effective. Starting with the fundamental properties of polygons and carefully setting up relationships between the angles led us to the correct answer. Always verifying the solution by plugging back values is crucial to ensure accuracy.",
  "ground_truth": "Let the measure of $\\angle A$ be $x$, so we have $\\angle B = x$ and $\\angle C=x$, too. Since $\\angle A$ is $40^\\circ$ less than $\\angle D$, we have $\\angle D = x + 40^\\circ$, so $\\angle E = x+40^\\circ$.  The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we have \\[x + x + x + (x+40^\\circ) + (x+40^\\circ) = 540^\\circ.\\] Simplifying the left side gives $5x + 80^\\circ = 540^\\circ$, so $5x = 460^\\circ$ and $x = 92^\\circ$.  Therefore, $\\angle D = \\angle A + 40^\\circ = \\boxed{132^\\circ}$."
