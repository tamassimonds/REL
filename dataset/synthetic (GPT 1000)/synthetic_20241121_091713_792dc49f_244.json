  "problem": "A particular fortune cookie lists four two-digit positive integers as your lucky numbers. The first three are 57, 13, and 72, but you got sauce on the last one and can't read it. If the sum of the digits of all four numbers equals $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the sum of all four numbers, what is the smallest possibility for the fourth lucky number?",
  "solution": "To determine the fourth number given three known numbers and specific conditions, we follow a structured approach:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Known Values\n\nWe start with the three known lucky numbers: **57**, **13**, and **72**.\n\n**Calculate the Sum of the Known Numbers:**\n\n\\[\n57 + 13 + 72 = 142\n\\]\n\nLet the fourth number be \\(x\\).\n\n### Step 2: Establish Total Sum\n\nThe total sum of the four numbers is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Sum} = 142 + x\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, the sum of the digits of all four numbers must equal \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the total sum:\n\n\\[\nS(57) + S(13) + S(72) + S(x) = \\frac{1}{5}(142 + x)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of the Digits of Known Numbers\n\nCalculate the sum of the digits for the known numbers:\n\n- For **57**: \\(S(57) = 5 + 7 = 12\\)\n- For **13**: \\(S(13) = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- For **72**: \\(S(72) = 7 + 2 = 9\\)\n\n**Total Sum of the Digits for Known Numbers:**\n\n\\[\nS(57) + S(13) + S(72) = 12 + 4 + 9 = 25\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Set Up the Equation\n\nIncorporating the unknown \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n25 + S(x) = \\frac{1}{5}(142 + x)\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Clear the Fraction\n\nMultiply both sides by 5:\n\n\\[\n5(25 + S(x)) = 142 + x\n\\]\n\nExpanding gives:\n\n\\[\n125 + 5S(x) = 142 + x\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Rearrange the Equation\n\nWe can rearrange to isolate \\(5S(x)\\):\n\n\\[\n5S(x) = x + 17\n\\]\n\nThis leads to:\n\n\\[\nS(x) = \\frac{x + 17}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Characteristics of \\(x\\)\n\n\\(x\\) must be a two-digit number ranging from \\(10\\) to \\(99\\). The sum of the digits, \\(S(x)\\), can range from \\(1\\) (for 10) to \\(18\\) (for 99).\n\nLet\u2019s express \\(x\\) as \\(10a + b\\), where \\(a\\) is the tens digit and \\(b\\) is the units digit:\n\n\\[\nS(x) = a + b\n\\]\nSubstituting this into our earlier equation:\n\n\\[\n5(a + b) = x + 17\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Simplifying Further\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n5a + 5b = 10a + b + 17 \\implies -5a + 4b = 17\n\\]\n\n### Step 9: Solve for Integer Solutions\n\nRearranging gives us:\n\n\\[\n4b = 5a + 17 \\implies b = \\frac{5a + 17}{4}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(b\\) to be an integer, \\(5a + 17\\) must be divisible by 4. Analyzing \\(5a + 17 \\mod 4\\), we find:\n\n- \\(5a \\mod 4 \\equiv a \\mod 4\\)\n- Thus: \\(a + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\) implies \\(a \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\).\n\nThe feasible values for \\(a\\) (0 to 9) are **3** and **7**.\n\n1. **For \\(a = 3\\)**:\n\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{5(3) + 17}{4} = \\frac{32}{4} = 8\n   \\]\n   Resulting in \\(x = 38\\).\n\n2. **For \\(a = 7\\)**:\n\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{5(7) + 17}{4} = \\frac{52}{4} = 13\n   \\]\n   This value for \\(b\\) is invalid as it must be a single digit.\n\n### Step 10: Verification\n\nWith \\(x = 38\\):\n\n- **Total Sum** = \\(142 + 38 = 180\\)\n- **Sum of Digits** = \\(25 + (3 + 8) = 36\\)\n\nVerifying the condition:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5}(180) = 36\n\\] \n\n### Final Result\n\nThe fourth lucky number is:\n\n<ANSWER>38</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The sum of the first three numbers is $57+13+72=142$. If we let $10a+b$ represent the last number, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively, then the sum of the four numbers is $142+10a+b$. The sum of the digits of the first three numbers is $5+7+1+3+7+2=25$, so the total sum of the digits is $25+a+b$. If we multiply the sum of the digits by 5, we should get the sum of the four numbers. \\begin{align*}\n142+10a+b&=5(25+a+b)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=125+5a+5b\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n17+5a&=4b\n\\end{align*} We notice that if we add a multiple of 5 to 17, the ones digit will either be 2 or 7. The next multiple of 4 that is greater than 17 and ends with a 2 or 7 is 32. That means $b=8$, while $17+5a=32$, so $5a=15$ and $a=3$. So the last number is $\\boxed{38}$."
