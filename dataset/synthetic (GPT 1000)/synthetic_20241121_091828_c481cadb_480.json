  "problem": "What numeral is in the 100th decimal place in the decimal representation of $\\frac{6}{7}$?",
  "solution": "To find the numeral in the 100th decimal place of the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\), we will first determine its decimal form and then identify the digit at the specified position.\n\n### Step 1: Convert \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\) into Decimal Form\nUsing long division, we divide \\(6\\) by \\(7\\):\n\n1. Since \\(6\\) is less than \\(7\\), we start with \\(0\\).\n2. Append a decimal point and a zero to get \\(60\\). \n   - \\(7\\) goes into \\(60\\) about \\(8\\) times (since \\(7 \\times 8 = 56\\)). Write down \\(8\\) and subtract \\(56\\) from \\(60\\), giving us \\(4\\).\n3. Bring down another zero to make \\(40\\).\n   - \\(7\\) goes into \\(40\\) about \\(5\\) times (since \\(7 \\times 5 = 35\\)). Write down \\(5\\) and subtract \\(35\\) from \\(40\\), giving us \\(5\\).\n4. Bring down another zero to make \\(50\\).\n   - \\(7\\) goes into \\(50\\) about \\(7\\) times (since \\(7 \\times 7 = 49\\)). Write down \\(7\\) and subtract \\(49\\) from \\(50\\), giving us \\(1\\).\n5. Bring down another zero to make \\(10\\).\n   - \\(7\\) goes into \\(10\\) about \\(1\\) time (since \\(7 \\times 1 = 7\\)). Write down \\(1\\) and subtract \\(7\\) from \\(10\\), giving us \\(3\\).\n6. Bring down another zero to make \\(30\\).\n   - \\(7\\) goes into \\(30\\) about \\(4\\) times (since \\(7 \\times 4 = 28\\)). Write down \\(4\\) and subtract \\(28\\) from \\(30\\), giving us \\(2\\).\n7. Bring down another zero to make \\(20\\).\n   - \\(7\\) goes into \\(20\\) about \\(2\\) times (since \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\)). Write down \\(2\\) and subtract \\(14\\) from \\(20\\), giving us \\(6\\).\n8. When we bring down another zero, we return to \\(60\\) and continue this cycle.\n\nThus, we find:\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{7} = 0.\\overline{857142},\n\\]\nindicating that the digits \\(857142\\) repeat every \\(6\\) digits.\n\n### Step 2: Locate the 100th Decimal Place\nNext, we determine the digit in the \\(100\\)th decimal place. Given that the repeating cycle has a length of \\(6\\), we calculate:\n\\[\n100 \\mod 6.\n\\]\nPerforming the division:\n\\[\n100 \\div 6 = 16 \\quad \\text{(integer part)},\n\\]\nleading to a remainder:\n\\[\n100 - 16 \\times 6 = 100 - 96 = 4.\n\\]\nThis means that the \\(100\\)th digit corresponds to the \\(4\\)th digit in the repeating sequence \\(857142\\).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the 4th Digit\nExamining the repeating sequence \\(857142\\):\n- 1st digit: \\(8\\)\n- 2nd digit: \\(5\\)\n- 3rd digit: \\(7\\)\n- 4th digit: \\(1\\)\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the numeral in the \\(100\\)th decimal place of \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\) is \\(1\\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{The answer is: } <ANSWER>1</ANSWER>\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{6}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{857142}$, which repeats every 6 digits. Since 100 divided by 6 has a remainder of 4, the 100th digit is the same as the fourth digit following the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{1}$."
