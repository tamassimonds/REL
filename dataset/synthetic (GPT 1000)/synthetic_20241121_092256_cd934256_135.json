  "problem": "A survey of $120$ teachers determined the following:\n\n$70$ had high blood pressure\n\n$40$ had heart trouble\n\n$20$ had both high blood pressure and heart trouble\n\nWhat percent of the teachers surveyed had neither high blood pressure nor heart trouble?",
  "solution": "To determine the percentage of teachers who had neither high blood pressure nor heart trouble, we can follow a systematic approach using the given data.\n\n1. **Identify Data**:  \n   - Total teachers surveyed: \\( 120 \\)  \n   - Teachers with high blood pressure (HP): \\( 70 \\)  \n   - Teachers with heart trouble (HT): \\( 40 \\)  \n   - Teachers with both conditions (HP and HT): \\( 20 \\)  \n\n2. **Calculate Exclusive Conditions**:  \n   - Teachers with only high blood pressure:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{HP only} = 70 - 20 = 50\n     \\]\n   - Teachers with only heart trouble:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{HT only} = 40 - 20 = 20\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total with Conditions**:  \n   To find the total number of teachers with at least one condition, add those with only one condition and those with both:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total with conditions} = 50 + 20 + 20 = 90\n   \\]\n\n4. **Teachers with Neither Condition**:  \n   Subtract the total number with conditions from the overall total of teachers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Teachers with neither} = 120 - 90 = 30\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Percentage**:  \n   Finally, compute the percentage of teachers who had neither high blood pressure nor heart trouble:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{30}{120} \\right) \\times 100 = 25\\%\n   \\]\n\nThus, **the percentage of teachers surveyed who had neither high blood pressure nor heart trouble is 25%**.",
  "ground_truth": "Of the 40 who had heart trouble, 20 also had high blood pressure, so there are $40-20=20$ teachers who only have heart trouble.  Similarly, there are $70-20 =50$ teachers with only high blood pressure.  So, of the 120 teachers total, there are $20 + 20 + 50 = 90$ teachers with one of these two maladies.  That means $120-90 = 30$ teachers with neither, which is $\\frac{30}{120} = \\boxed{25\\%}$ of the teachers.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Heart Trouble\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"High Blood Pressure\", (80,74));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$20$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$20$\",(28,58));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$50$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]"
