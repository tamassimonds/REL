  "problem": "For what value of $k$ does the equation $x^2+10x+y^2+6y-k=0$ represent a circle of radius 6?",
  "solution": "To find the value of \\( k \\) such that the equation \\( x^2 + 10x + y^2 + 6y - k = 0 \\) represents a circle with radius 6, we need to rewrite the equation in standard form and identify its center and radius.\n\n1. **Rearranging the Equation**: We start by moving \\( k \\) to the right side:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x + y^2 + 6y = k\n   \\]\n\n2. **Completing the Square for \\( x \\)**: For the \\( x \\) terms, \\( x^2 + 10x \\), we complete the square:\n   - Take half of 10 (which is 5) and square it to get 25. Thus, we rewrite:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 10x = (x + 5)^2 - 25\n   \\]\n\n3. **Completing the Square for \\( y \\)**: For the \\( y \\) terms, \\( y^2 + 6y \\):\n   - Take half of 6 (which is 3) and square it to get 9. Then, we rewrite:\n   \\[\n   y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substituting Back into the Equation**: We replace the completed squares into the equation:\n   \\[\n   (x + 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 = k\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   (x + 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 = k\n   \\]\n   Rearranging results in:\n   \\[\n   (x + 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = k + 34\n   \\]\n\n5. **Identifying the Radius**: The standard form of a circle is \\( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius. From our equation, we observe that:\n   \\[\n   r^2 = k + 34\n   \\]\n\n6. **Setting the Radius**: Given that the radius is 6, we equate:\n   \\[\n   r^2 = 6^2 = 36\n   \\]\n   This leads us to:\n   \\[\n   k + 34 = 36\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solving for \\( k \\)**: Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   k = 36 - 34 = 2\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( k \\) making the equation represent a circle of radius 6 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\nThis concise explanation confirms that \\( k = 2 \\).",
  "ground_truth": "Completing the square, we can rewrite this equation as $(x+5)^2-25+(y+3)^2-9=k$, or $(x+5)^2+(y+3)^2=34+k$. Because this equation must represent a circle of radius 6, we need $34+k=6^2=36$, so $k=\\boxed{2}$."
