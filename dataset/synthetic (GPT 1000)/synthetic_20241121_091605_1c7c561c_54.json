  "problem": "For positive integers $n$, let $f(n)$ return the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point. How many positive integer divisors does $f(2010)$ have?",
  "solution": "To determine \\( f(n) \\), which gives the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( \\frac{1}{k} \\) has exactly \\( n \\) digits after the decimal point, we can break down the solution into several key steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Decimal Representation**:\n   The decimal representation of \\( \\frac{1}{k} \\) depends on the factors of \\( k \\). If we express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 2^a \\cdot 5^b \\cdot d \\), where \\( d \\) is coprime to 10 (not divisible by 2 or 5), the decimal will terminate if \\( d = 1 \\) (meaning it only involves powers of 2 and 5). The number of decimal places is determined by \\( \\max(a, b) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Decimal terminates after } \\max(a, b) \\text{ digits.}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Setting Up the Condition**:\n   For \\( \\frac{1}{k} \\) to have exactly \\( n \\) digits after the decimal point, we require:\n   \\[\n   \\max(a, b) = n.\n   \\]\n   This means:\n   - If \\( a = n \\), \\( b \\) can range from 0 to \\( n \\).\n   - If \\( b = n \\), \\( a \\) can range from 0 to \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Finding the Minimum \\( k \\)**:\n   The smallest \\( k \\) that satisfies \\( \\max(a, b) = n \\) can be determined as follows:\n   - If \\( a = n \\) and \\( b = 0 \\), then \\( k = 2^n \\).\n   - If \\( b = n \\) and \\( a = 0 \\), then \\( k = 5^n \\).\n   - If both \\( a = n \\) and \\( b = n \\), then \\( k = 2^n \\cdot 5^n = 10^n \\).\n\n   Among \\( 2^n \\) and \\( 5^n \\), \\( 2^n \\) is always smaller because \\( 2 < 5 \\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   f(n) = 2^n.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating \\( f(2010) \\)**:\n   Based on the above reasoning:\n   \\[\n   f(2010) = 2^{2010}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding Number of Positive Divisors**:\n   The number of positive divisors of \\( k = f(2010) = 2^{2010} \\) can be computed using the divisor formula based on its prime factorization:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of divisors} = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1).\n   \\]\n   Here, there is 1 prime factor \\( 2^{2010} \\) with exponent \\( e_1 = 2010 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of divisors} = 2010 + 1 = 2011.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The number of positive integer divisors of } f(2010) \\text{ is } 2011.\n\\] \n\nFinal answer: <ANSWER>2011 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We will try to prove that $f(n) = 2^n$. Given that $f(n) = k$, we know that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point. If we multiply $\\frac{1}{k}$ by $10^n$, then all the digits are shifted $n$ places to the left, so we should end up with an integer that is not divisible by 10. Therefore, we want to find the smallest integer $k$ that divides $10^n$ and leaves a quotient that is not divisible by 10. If we let $k = 2^n$, then the quotient is $5^n$, which is odd and therefore not divisible by 10. For any integer smaller than $2^n$, the maximum power of 2 that can divide such an integer is $2^{n-1}$, so there remains at least one power of two that combines with a power of five to form an integer divisible by 10. Therefore, we have proved that $f(n) = 2^n$.\n\nAs a result, we can now conclude that $f(2010) = 2^{2010}$. The only integers that can divide $2^{2010}$ are $2^x$, for $0 \\le x \\le 2010$. There are $\\boxed{2011}$ such integers."
