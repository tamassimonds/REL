  "problem": "Adam and Simon start on bicycle trips from the same point at the same time. Adam travels east at 8mph and Simon travels south at 6mph. After how many hours are they 60 miles apart?",
  "solution": "In this problem, we need to determine how many hours it takes for Adam and Simon to be 60 miles apart while traveling in perpendicular directions. Adam is traveling east at 8 mph, and Simon is traveling south at 6 mph.\n\nTo solve this, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the distance between the two travelers) is the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the distances each has traveled).\n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Let \\( t \\) be the time in hours after they start traveling.\n   - The distance Adam travels in \\( t \\) hours is \\( 8t \\) miles.\n   - The distance Simon travels in \\( t \\) hours is \\( 6t \\) miles.\n\n2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem**:\n   The distance between them (the hypotenuse, \\( c \\)) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   c = \\sqrt{(8t)^2 + (6t)^2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\( c \\)**:\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   c = \\sqrt{64t^2 + 36t^2} = \\sqrt{100t^2} = 10t\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set up the equation**:\n   We want to find when they are 60 miles apart:\n   \\[\n   10t = 60\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( t \\)**:\n   Dividing both sides by 10 results in:\n   \\[\n   t = 6 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAfter 6 hours of travel, Adam and Simon will be 60 miles apart.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n<ANSWER>6 hours solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "If Adam travels east and Simon travels south, then their paths are perpendicular and their distance apart is the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Let $x$ be the number of hours it takes for Adam and Simon to be $60$ miles apart. Then Adam has traveled $8x$ miles and Simon has traveled $6x$ miles. By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have  \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(8x)^2+(6x)^2}&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n\\sqrt{100x^2}&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n10x&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nx&=6.\n\\end{align*}They are $60$ miles apart after $\\boxed{6}$ hours."
