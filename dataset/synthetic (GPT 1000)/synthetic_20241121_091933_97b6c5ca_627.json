  "problem": "Consider the set of 30 parabolas defined as follows: all parabolas have as focus the point $(0,0)$ and the directrix lines have the form $y=ax+b$ with $a$ and $b$ integers such that $a\\in \\{-2,-1,0,1,2\\}$ and $b\\in \\{-3,-2,-1,1,2,3\\}$. No three of these parabolas have a common point. How many points in the plane are on two of these parabolas?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of intersection points in the plane where two of the defined parabolas meet, we can break down the solution into clear steps.\n\n### Step 1: Count the Parabolas\nWe are given:\n- 5 different values for \\( a \\): \\(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\)\n- 6 different values for \\( b \\): \\(-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3\\)\n\nFrom these, the total number of distinct parabolas we can create is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 6 = 30\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Understand Intersections\nTwo distinct parabolas can intersect at most at 2 points. However, the intersection depends on the slopes of their directrices:\n- If two parabolas have the same \\( a \\) (making them parallel), they will only intersect if their \\( b \\) values allow for their foci to be positioned between their directrices.\n\n### Step 3: Count Non-Intersecting Pairs\nNext, we want to identify how many pairs of parabolas do **not** intersect:\n- For parabolas sharing the same \\( a \\) value, we can categorize the \\( b \\) values:\n  - Negative \\( b \\) values: \\(\\{-3, -2, -1\\}\\)\n  - Positive \\( b \\) values: \\(\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\)\n\nFor each \\( a \\) value:\n- Selecting 2 \\( b \\) values from either the negative or positive sets (ensuring they do not intersect) gives us:\n\\[\n\\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{3}{2} = 3 + 3 = 6 \\text{ non-intersecting pairs}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying this by the 5 possible \\( a \\) values results in:\n\\[\n5 \\times 6 = 30 \\text{ non-intersecting pairs}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Count Total Pairs\nThe total number of ways to select any 2 parabolas from the 30 available is calculated using:\n\\[\n\\binom{30}{2} = \\frac{30 \\cdot 29}{2} = 435\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Intersecting Pairs\nFrom the total pairs of parabolas, we subtract the non-intersecting pairs to find the number of intersecting pairs:\n\\[\n435 - 30 = 405\n\\]\n\nSince each intersecting pair meets at 2 points, the overall number of intersection points is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 405 = 810\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe total number of distinct points in the plane that lie on two of these parabolas is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{810}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "If two parabolas have the same focus, and their directrices intersect, then the parabolas intersect in exactly two points.\n\nSuppose two parabolas have the same focus and their directrices are parallel.  If the focus lies between the two directrices, then the parabolas again intersect in exactly two points.  However, if the focus does not between the two directrices, then the parabolas do not intersect.\n\nThere are $\\binom{30}{2}$ ways to choose a pair of parabolas.  In terms of $a$ and $b,$ the parabolas do not intersect when their slopes $a$ are the same, and their $b$-values have the same sign (because this is when the focus does not lie between the two directrices).  There are five ways to choose the value of $a,$ and $\\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{3}{2} = 6$ ways to choose the values of $b$ (either both are negative or both are positive).  Hence, the total number of intersection points is\n\\[2 \\left( \\binom{30}{2} - 5 \\cdot 6 \\right) = \\boxed{810}.\\]"
