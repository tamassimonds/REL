  "problem": "We have a standard deck of 52 cards, with 4 cards in each of 13 ranks.  We call a 5-card poker hand a full house if the hand has 3 cards of one rank and 2 cards of another rank (such as 33355 or AAAKK).  What is the probability that five cards chosen at random form a full house?",
  "solution": "To calculate the probability of drawing a full house from a standard 52-card deck in a 5-card hand, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Number of 5-Card Hands\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 5 cards from a 52-card deck is computed using the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total hands} = \\binom{52}{5} = \\frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!} = 2,598,960\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Count Full House Hands\n\nA full house consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. We will determine the number of unique full house combinations as follows:\n\n1. **Choose the Ranks**:\n   - Select a rank for the three cards (the triplet). There are 13 possible ranks.\n   - Select a different rank for the two cards (the pair). There are 12 remaining ranks.\n\n   Therefore, the total ways to choose the ranks is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ways to choose ranks} = 13 \\times 12 = 156\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choose the Cards**:\n   - For the triplet, choose 3 cards from the 4 available. This can be done in:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{3} = 4 \\text{ ways}\n   \\]\n\n   - For the pair, choose 2 cards from the 4 available, which gives:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\text{ ways}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine Choices**:\n   - The total number of ways to form a full house is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total full house hands} = \\text{Ways to choose ranks} \\times \\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2} = 156 \\times 4 \\times 6\n   \\]\n\n   Performing the calculations:\n\n   \\[\n   156 \\times 4 = 624\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   624 \\times 6 = 3,744\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability\n\nNow, we compute the probability of drawing a full house:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Full House}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of Full House Hands}}{\\text{Total Hands}} = \\frac{3,744}{2,598,960}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the Probability\n\nPerforming the division:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Full House}) \\approx 0.00144057623\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the probability that a randomly selected 5-card hand is a full house is:\n\n**0.00144057623**",
  "ground_truth": "The total number of outcomes is just the number of ways to choose 5 cards from a set of 52, which is $\\binom{52}{5} = 2,\\!598,\\!960$.  Notice that in this count, we don't care about the order in which the cards are chosen.\n\nTo count the number of successful outcomes, we turn to constructive counting, thinking about how we'd construct a full house.\n\nTo form a full house, we have to choose:\n\nA rank for the 3 cards.  This can be done in 13 ways.\n\n3 of the 4 cards of that rank.  This can be done in $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways.\n\nA rank for the other 2 cards.  This can be done in 12 ways (since we can't choose the rank that we chose in (a)).\n\n2 of the 4 cards of that rank.  This can be done in $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\n\nAgain, note that in each of the steps in our constructive count, we don't care about the order in which the cards are chosen.\n\nSo there are $13 \\times 4 \\times 12 \\times 6 = 3,\\!744$ full houses.  Thus, the probability is $$ \\frac{3,\\!744}{2,\\!598,\\!960} = \\boxed{\\frac{6}{4165}}. $$"
