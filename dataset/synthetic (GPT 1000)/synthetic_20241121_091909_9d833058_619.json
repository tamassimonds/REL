  "problem": "Solve for $x>0$ in the following arithmetic sequence: $1^2, x^2, 3^2, \\ldots$.",
  "solution": "An arithmetic sequence is characterized by having a constant difference between consecutive terms. In the provided sequence, the terms are defined as follows:\n\n1. The first term, \\( a_1 = 1^2 = 1 \\)\n2. The second term, \\( a_2 = x^2 \\)\n3. The third term, \\( a_3 = 3^2 = 9 \\)\n\nTo maintain the properties of an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms must be equal. This can be expressed by the equation:\n\n\\[\na_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2\n\\]\n\nBy substituting the values of the terms, we have:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 1 = 9 - x^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we simplify this equation step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we add \\( x^2 \\) to both sides:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 1 + x^2 = 9\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 1 = 9\n\\]\n\n2. Then we add 1 to both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 = 10\n\\]\n\n3. Finally, we divide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 5\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), we take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nSince we are considering \\( x > 0 \\), we conclude:\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER> \u221a5 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The term $x^2$ is simply the average of $1^2 = 1$ and $3^2 = 9$, so $x^2 = (1 + 9)/2 = 5$.  Because $x > 0$, $x = \\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}$."
