  "problem": "Bob is trying to decide between two cell phone plans. Plan A has no flat fee, but the user must pay $10$ cents per minute on the phone. Plan B requires a one-time fee of $\\$20$, but only requires a payment of $5$ cents per minute on the phone. What is the minimum whole number of minutes Bob has to use the phone for to make Plan B the cheaper plan?",
  "solution": "To find the minimum number of minutes \\( m \\) that Bob must use for Plan B to be cheaper than Plan A, we can compare the costs of both plans based on the number of minutes used.\n\n1. **Cost of Plan A**:\n   - Plan A charges \\( 10 \\) cents per minute.\n   - Therefore, the total cost for \\( m \\) minutes under Plan A is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of Plan A} = 10m \\quad \\text{(in cents)}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Cost of Plan B**:\n   - Plan B has a one-time fee of \\( \\$20 \\), equivalent to \\( 2000 \\) cents.\n   - After the one-time fee, it charges \\( 5 \\) cents per minute.\n   - Thus, the total cost for \\( m \\) minutes under Plan B is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of Plan B} = 2000 + 5m \\quad \\text{(in cents)}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Inequality Setup**:\n   - To determine when Plan B is cheaper than Plan A, we set up the inequality:\n     \\[\n     2000 + 5m < 10m\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving the Inequality**:\n   - Rearranging the inequality gives:\n     \\[\n     2000 < 10m - 5m\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     2000 < 5m\n     \\]\n   - Dividing both sides by \\( 5 \\) results in:\n     \\[\n     400 < m\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, it follows that:\n     \\[\n     m > 400\n     \\]\n\n5. **Minimum Whole Number Solution**:\n   - As \\( m \\) must be a whole number, the smallest integer that satisfies \\( m > 400 \\) is \\( m = 401 \\).\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum number of whole minutes that Bob must use for Plan B to be the cheaper option is:\n\n**401**",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of minutes that Bob anticipates using. Plan A costs $10x$ cents, while Plan B costs $2000 + 5x$ cents. We therefore have the inequality \\begin{align*}\n2000+5x &< 10x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2000 &< 5x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 400 &< x.\n\\end{align*} The smallest integer $x$ such that $400 < x$ is $401$. Therefore, Bob must use at least $\\boxed{401}$ minutes to make Plan B cheaper."
