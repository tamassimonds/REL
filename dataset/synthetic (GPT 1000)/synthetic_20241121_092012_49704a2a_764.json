  "solution": "To solve the equation \\( (a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 150 \\), we utilize the identity that expresses the difference between the cube of a sum and the sum of cubes:\n\n\\[\n(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 3(a+b)(b+c)(c+a).\n\\]\n\nApplying this identity, we rewrite the equation as follows:\n\n\\[\n3(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 150.\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 3 gives:\n\n\\[\n(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 50.\n\\]\n\nWe need to find positive integers \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) such that the product \\( (a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 50 \\). \n\n### Step 1: Factor Combinations\n\nNext, we list the factor combinations of 50:\n\n1. \\( (1, 1, 50) \\)\n2. \\( (1, 2, 25) \\)\n3. \\( (1, 5, 10) \\)\n4. \\( (2, 5, 5) \\)\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Each Combination\n\nNow, we analyze each combination for potential solutions:\n\n1. **Combination: \\( (1, 1, 50) \\)**\n   - Not viable, as one factor is too large compared to the others.\n\n2. **Combination: \\( (1, 2, 25) \\)**\n   - No valid solution results in positive integers.\n\n3. **Combination: \\( (1, 5, 10) \\)**\n   - Setting up equations:\n     - \\( a+b = 1 \\)\n     - \\( b+c = 5 \\)\n     - \\( c+a = 10 \\)\n     \n   Substituting \\( a = 1 - b \\) into \\( b+c = 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   b + (10 - a) = 5 \\implies b + 10 - (1-b) = 5 \\implies 2b + 9 = 5 \\implies 2b = -4 \\text{ (not possible)}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combination: \\( (2, 5, 5) \\)**\n   - Setting up equations:\n     - \\( a+b = 2 \\)\n     - \\( b+c = 5 \\)\n     - \\( c+a = 5 \\)\n     \n   From \\( a+b = 2 \\), we have \\( b = 2 - a \\).

  "ground_truth": "Consider the expression $P(a) = (a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3$ as a polynomial in $a$. It follows that $P(-b) = (b -b + c)^3 - (-b)^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 0$, so $a+b$ is a factor of the polynomial $P(a)$. By symmetry, $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)$ divides into the expression $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3$; as both expressions are of degree $3$ in their variables, it follows that $$(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = k(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 150 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5,$$ where we can determine that $k = 3$ by examining what the expansion of $(a+b+c)^3$ will look like. Since $a,b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, then $a+b$, $b+c$, and $c+a$ must all be greater than $1$, so it follows that $\\{a+b, b+c, c+a\\} = \\{2,5,5\\}$. Summing all three, we obtain that $$(a+b) + (b+c) + (c+a) = 2(a+b+c) = 2 + 5 + 5 = 12,$$ so $a+b+c = \\boxed{6}$."
