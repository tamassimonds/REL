  "problem": "A state requires that all boat licenses consist of the letter A or M followed by any five digits. What is the number of groups of letters and numbers available for boat licenses?",
  "solution": "To determine the total number of combinations for the described boat license format, we can separate the components into two distinct parts: the letter and the digits.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Letter Part\nThe license begins with either the letter 'A' or 'M', providing us with:\n- **2 options** (A or M)\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Digit Part\nFollowing the initial letter, the license includes a sequence of five digits, with each digit ranging from 0 to 9. For each of these five digits, there are:\n- **10 options** (0 through 9)\n\nSince the digits are chosen independently, the total number of combinations for the five digits can be calculated as follows:\n- Total combinations for the digits = \\(10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 10^5\\)\n\nCalculating \\(10^5\\):\n- \\(10^5 = 100000\\)\n\n### Step 3: Calculating Total Combinations\nNow, to find the overall number of boat license combinations, we multiply the number of options for the letter part by the number of combinations for the digit part:\n- Total combinations = (number of letter options) \u00d7 (number of digit combinations)\n- Total combinations = 2 \u00d7 \\(10^5\\)\n- Total combinations = 2 \u00d7 100000 = 200000\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the total number of possible boat license combinations is **200,000**.",
  "ground_truth": "There are two choices for the letter, followed by ten choices of a digit for each of the next five slots. Thus, there are $2 \\cdot 10^5 = \\boxed{200000}$ combinations."
