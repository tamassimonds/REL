  "problem": "A rhombus has an area of 108 square units. The lengths of its diagonals have a ratio of 3 to 2. What is the length of the longest diagonal, in units?",
  "solution": "To determine the length of the longest diagonal of a rhombus with an area of 108 square units and a diagonal ratio of 3:2, we can follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Define the diagonals based on their ratio.**\n\nLet the diagonals be \\( d_1 \\) (longer diagonal) and \\( d_2 \\) (shorter diagonal). According to the given ratio, we can express them as:\n\n\\[\nd_1 = 3x, \\quad d_2 = 2x\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Use the area formula for a rhombus.**\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of a rhombus can be calculated using its diagonals:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( A = 108 \\) square units, substituting the expressions for the diagonals yields:\n\n\\[\n108 = \\frac{1}{2} (3x)(2x)\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the equation.**\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n108 = \\frac{1}{2} (6x^2) = 3x^2\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( x^2 \\).**\n\nDividing both sides by 3 gives:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{108}{3} = 36\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Calculate \\( x \\).**\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{36} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 6: Determine the lengths of the diagonals.**\n\nNow, substituting back to find the lengths of the diagonals:\n\n\\[\nd_1 = 3x = 3(6) = 18 \\quad \\text{(longer diagonal)}\n\\]\n\\[\nd_2 = 2x = 2(6) = 12 \\quad \\text{(shorter diagonal)}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe length of the longest diagonal is \\( 18 \\) units. \n\n\\[\n\\text{ANSWER: } 18\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let the diagonals have length $3x$ and $2x$. Half the product of the diagonals of a rhombus is equal to the area, so $(2x)(3x)/2= 108$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = 6$. Therefore, the length of the longest diagonal is $3x = \\boxed{18}$."
