  "problem": "The sum of two positive integers $a$ and $b$ is 1001.  What is the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$?",
  "solution": "To determine the largest possible value of \\( \\gcd(a, b) \\) given that \\( a + b = 1001 \\), we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Relationship**: \n   - Given \\( a + b = 1001 \\), let \\( d = \\gcd(a, b) \\). We can express \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) as:\n     \\[\n     a = dx \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = dy\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are coprime integers, meaning \\( \\gcd(x, y) = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Substituting into the Equation**:\n   - Substituting into the sum, we get:\n     \\[\n     dx + dy = 1001 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad d(x + y) = 1001\n     \\]\n   - Rearranging gives:\n     \\[\n     d = \\frac{1001}{x + y}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Maximizing \\( d \\)**:\n   - To maximize \\( d \\), we minimize \\( x + y \\). Since \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must be positive coprime integers, the smallest \\( x + y \\) can be is 2 (i.e., \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\)).\n   - However, since \\( 1001 \\) is odd, \\( x + y \\) cannot equal 2, as this would lead to \\( d \\) being non-integer.\n\n4. **Finding Odd Values**:\n   - We need to explore odd integer values for \\( x + y \\) to ensure \\( d \\) remains an integer. This leads us to examine the odd divisors of \\( 1001 \\).\n\n5. **Dividing 1001**:\n   - The prime factorization of \\( 1001 \\) is:\n     \\[\n     1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13\n     \\]\n   - Listing the odd divisors of \\( 1001 \\) gives us: \\( 1, 7, 11, 13, 77, 91, 143, 1001 \\).\n\n6. **Choosing the Largest Valid Divisor**:\n   - The largest divisor, \\( 1001 \\), cannot be used because it would mean \\( b = 0 \\) when \\( a = 1001 \\), not allowing both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to be positive.\n   - The next largest divisor is \\( 143 \\):\n     - If \\( d = 143 \\), then:\n     \\[\n     x + y = \\frac{1001}{143} = 7\n     \\]\n     Valid coprime pairs \\( (x, y) \\) that sum to 7 include \\( (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4) \\) and their reverses, ensuring both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, the largest valid \\( \\gcd(a, b) \\) when considering positive integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\boxed{143}\n     \\]\n\nThe solution can be succinctly expressed as:\n<ANSWER>143 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Note that $\\gcd(a,b)$ divides both $a$ and $b$, so $\\gcd(a,b)$ must also divide $a + b = 1001$.  Clearly, $\\gcd(a,b)$ cannot be equal to 1001 (because both $a$ and $b$ must be less than 1001).  The next-largest divisor of 1001 is 143.  If $a = 143$ and $b = 1001 - 143 = 858$, then $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(143,858) = 143$.  Therefore, the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ is $\\boxed{143}$."
