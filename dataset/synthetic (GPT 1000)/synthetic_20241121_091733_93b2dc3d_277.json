  "problem": "Let $m$ and $n$ be any two odd numbers, with $n$ less than $m$. The largest integer which divides all possible numbers of the form $m^2-n^2$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 2\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 4\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 6\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 8\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 16$\n",
  "solution": "To find the largest integer that divides all numbers of the form \\( m^2 - n^2 \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are odd integers (with \\( n < m \\)), we start by using the difference of squares formula:\n\n\\[\nm^2 - n^2 = (m - n)(m + n).\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Substitute Odd Number Representations\n\nWe express odd integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) in terms of integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n\n- \\( m = 2a + 1 \\)\n- \\( n = 2b + 1 \\)\n\nNow we can find \\( m - n \\) and \\( m + n \\):\n\n\\[\nm - n = (2a + 1) - (2b + 1) = 2(a - b),\n\\]\n\\[\nm + n = (2a + 1) + (2b + 1) = 2(a + b + 1).\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rewrite the Difference of Squares\n\nSubstituting these expressions into our original equation gives:\n\n\\[\nm^2 - n^2 = (m - n)(m + n) = [2(a - b)][2(a + b + 1)] = 4(a - b)(a + b + 1).\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Identify Divisibility\n\nFrom this factorization, we observe that \\( m^2 - n^2 \\) is divisible by \\( 4 \\). To explore divisibility by \\( 8 \\), we need to analyze the parities of the factors \\( a - b \\) and \\( a + b + 1 \\):\n\n- \\( a - b \\) can be even or odd.\n- \\( a + b + 1 \\) is even, as it adds an odd number (1) to the sum of two integers.\n\n### Step 4: Consider Different Parities\n\n1. If both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are even or both are odd:\n   - \\( a - b \\) is even.\n   - \\( a + b + 1 \\) is odd, leading to divisibility by \\( 4 \\) only.\n\n2. If one of \\( a \\) or \\( b \\) is even, and the other is odd:\n   - \\( a - b \\) is odd.\n   - \\( a + b + 1 \\) is even, resulting in divisibility by \\( 4 \\).\n\nIn all cases, \\( m^2 - n^2 \\) is divisible by \\( 4 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Test Specific Values\n\nTesting pairs of odd integers:\n\n1. For \\( m = 3 \\), \\( n = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   3^2 - 1^2 = 9 - 1 = 8,\n   \\]\n   which is divisible by \\( 8 \\).\n\n2. For \\( m = 5 \\), \\( n = 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   5^2 - 3^2 = 25 - 9 = 16,\n   \\]\n   which is also divisible by \\( 8 \\).\n\nBoth results are divisible by \\( 8 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince \\( m^2 - n^2 \\) is consistently divisible by \\( 4 \\), and in some cases yields results like \\( 8 \\) or \\( 16 \\), the largest integer that divides all forms of \\( m^2 - n^2 \\) for odd integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "First, factor the difference of squares.\\[(m+n)(m-n)\\]Since $m$ and $n$ are odd numbers, let $m=2a+1$ and $n=2b+1$, where $a$ and $b$ can be any integer.\\[(2a+2b+2)(2a-2b)\\]Factor the resulting expression.\\[4(a+b+1)(a-b)\\]If $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $a-b$ is even. If $a$ and $b$ are both odd, then $a-b$ is even as well. If $a$ is odd and $b$ is even (or vise versa), then $a+b+1$ is even. Therefore, in all cases, $8$ can be divided into all numbers with the form $m^2-n^2$.\nThis can be confirmed by setting $m=3$ and $n=1$, making $m^2-n^2=9-1=8$. Since $8$ is not a multiple of $3$ and is less than $16$, we can confirm that the answer is $\\boxed{8}$."
