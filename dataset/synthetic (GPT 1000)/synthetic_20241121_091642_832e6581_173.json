  "problem": "Bob is trying to decide between two cell phone plans. Plan A has no flat fee, but the user must pay $10$ cents per minute on the phone. Plan B requires a one-time fee of $\\$20$, but only requires a payment of $5$ cents per minute on the phone. What is the minimum whole number of minutes Bob has to use the phone for to make Plan B the cheaper plan?",
  "solution": "To find out when Plan B becomes cheaper than Plan A for Bob, we will analyze the costs associated with both plans step by step.\n\n1. **Cost Definitions**:\n   - **Plan A**: Charges 10 cents per minute with no flat fee. The total cost for Plan A can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     C_A = 10m \\quad \\text{(in cents)}\n     \\]\n     where \\( m \\) is the number of minutes used.\n   \n   - **Plan B**: Has a one-time fee of $20 (2000 cents) and charges 5 cents per minute. The total cost for Plan B is given by:\n     \\[\n     C_B = 2000 + 5m \\quad \\text{(in cents)}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Inequality Setup**:\n   We need to determine when Plan B is cheaper than Plan A, which is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   C_B < C_A\n   \\]\n   Substituting in the expressions for \\( C_A \\) and \\( C_B \\):\n   \\[\n   2000 + 5m < 10m\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rearranging the Inequality**:\n   Simplifying the inequality involves subtracting \\( 5m \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2000 < 10m - 5m\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   2000 < 5m\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( m \\)**:\n   Next, divide both sides by \\( 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2000}{5} < m\n   \\]\n   This results in:\n   \\[\n   400 < m\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Minimum Whole Number**:\n   The inequality \\( 400 < m \\) indicates that \\( m \\) must be greater than \\( 400 \\). The smallest whole number satisfying this condition is \\( 401 \\).\n\nHence, Bob must use his phone for at least **401 minutes** for Plan B to be the cheaper option.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n<ANSWER>401</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of minutes that Bob anticipates using. Plan A costs $10x$ cents, while Plan B costs $2000 + 5x$ cents. We therefore have the inequality \\begin{align*}\n2000+5x &< 10x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2000 &< 5x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 400 &< x.\n\\end{align*} The smallest integer $x$ such that $400 < x$ is $401$. Therefore, Bob must use at least $\\boxed{401}$ minutes to make Plan B cheaper."
