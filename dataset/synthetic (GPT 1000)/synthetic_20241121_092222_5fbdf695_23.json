  "problem": "The graph of an equation \\[\\sqrt{(x-3)^2 + (y+4)^2} + \\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-8)^2} = 20.\\]is an ellipse. What is the distance between its foci?",
  "solution": "To solve the equation \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x-3)^2 + (y+4)^2} + \\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-8)^2} = 20,\n\\]\n\nwe recognize that this represents the equation of an ellipse, where the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to two fixed points (the foci) is a constant.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the foci\n\nFrom the given equation, the foci of the ellipse are:\n\n- \\( F_1 = (3, -4) \\)\n- \\( F_2 = (-5, 8) \\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the distance between the foci\n\nNext, we calculate the distance between the two foci using the distance formula:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the coordinates of the foci:\n\n- For \\( F_1 \\) (first focus): \\( (x_1, y_1) = (3, -4) \\)\n- For \\( F_2 \\) (second focus): \\( (x_2, y_2) = (-5, 8) \\)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate coordinate differences\n\nWe find the differences in the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) coordinates:\n\n\\[\nx_2 - x_1 = -5 - 3 = -8,\n\\]\n\\[\ny_2 - y_1 = 8 - (-4) = 8 + 4 = 12.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Substitute into the distance formula\n\nNow substituting the coordinate differences into the distance formula:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(-8)^2 + (12)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 144} = \\sqrt{208} = \\sqrt{16 \\cdot 13} = 4\\sqrt{13}.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the distance between the foci of the ellipse is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4\\sqrt{13}}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let $F_1 = (3, -4)$ and $F_2 = (-5, 8)$. Then, given a point $P = (x, y)$, we can rewrite the given equation as \\[PF_1 + PF_2 = 20\\]by the distance formula. Therefore, the ellipse has foci $F_1$ and $F_2$, and so the answer is \\[F_1F_2 = \\sqrt{(3+5)^2 + (-4-8)^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 + 12^2} = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{13}}.\\]"
