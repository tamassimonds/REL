  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll be thinking out loud, reflecting, and checking my work as I go along, just like I would if I were solving this on paper. Let's get started!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem is asking me to square each integer from 1 to 10, find the remainders when those squares are divided by 11, sum up all the distinct remainders to get \\( m \\), and then find the quotient when \\( m \\) is divided by 11.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This reminds me of modular arithmetic problems I've encountered before.\n- I think I'll need to compute the squares first, then apply modulus 11 to each.\n- Distinct remainders\u2014so no duplicates in the sum. Need to be careful about that.\n- Finally, dividing \\( m \\) by 11 to get the quotient. Sounds straightforward, but I should double-check each step to avoid mistakes.\n\nBut wait, let me brainstorm different strategies to see which one might be the most efficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Calculation:**\n   - Compute each square, find the remainder modulo 11, collect distinct remainders, sum them up, and then divide by 11.\n\n2. **Recognize Patterns:**\n   - Maybe there's a pattern in the remainders that can simplify the process. If the remainders repeat in a predictable way, I could use that to speed things up.\n\n3. **Use Properties of Modulo:**\n   - Perhaps leveraging properties of modular arithmetic can help. For example, knowing that \\( (n + 11) \\equiv n \\mod 11 \\) might come in handy, but since our range is only up to 10, it might not be necessary.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The direct calculation seems straightforward and foolproof, especially since the range is small (1 to 10). I can easily compute each step manually or with a simple script.\n- Looking for patterns could save time, but given the small range, it might be just as quick to calculate directly.\n- Using properties of modulo doesn\u2019t seem immediately helpful beyond what\u2019s already required.\n\nI think I'll start with the **Direct Calculation** approach. If it feels too tedious or if I notice a pattern along the way, I can adjust my strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Compute the Squares**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to square each integer from 1 to 10. Let's list them out and perform the calculations.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1^2 &= 1 \\\\\n2^2 &= 4 \\\\\n3^2 &= 9 \\\\\n4^2 &= 16 \\\\\n5^2 &= 25 \\\\\n6^2 &= 36 \\\\\n7^2 &= 49 \\\\\n8^2 &= 64 \\\\\n9^2 &= 81 \\\\\n10^2 &= 100 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- That was straightforward. No issues here.\n- I think I\u2019m on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Find Remainders Modulo 11**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, I need to find the remainder when each square is divided by 11. This is essentially computing \\( n^2 \\mod 11 \\) for each \\( n \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1 \\mod 11 &= 1 \\\\\n4 \\mod 11 &= 4 \\\\\n9 \\mod 11 &= 9 \\\\\n16 \\mod 11 &= 5 \\quad (\\text{since } 16 - 11 = 5) \\\\\n25 \\mod 11 &= 3 \\quad (\\text{since } 25 - 22 = 3) \\\\\n36 \\mod 11 &= 3 \\quad (\\text{since } 36 - 33 = 3) \\\\\n49 \\mod 11 &= 5 \\quad (\\text{since } 49 - 44 = 5) \\\\\n64 \\mod 11 &= 9 \\quad (\\text{since } 64 - 55 = 9) \\\\\n81 \\mod 11 &= 4 \\quad (\\text{since } 81 - 77 = 4) \\\\\n100 \\mod 11 &= 1 \\quad (\\text{since } 100 - 99 = 1) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- I notice that some remainders repeat (e.g., 3 and 5 appear twice).\n- This means that when summing distinct remainders, I need to ensure I only count each unique remainder once.\n- So far, so good. No discrepancies in the calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identify Distinct Remainders**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I need to extract the unique remainders from the list above to ensure no duplicates are included in the sum.\n\n**List of Remainders:**\n\n\\[\n\\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 4, 1\\}\n\\]\n\n**Distinct Remainders:**\n\n\\[\n\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Double-checking the list to make sure I didn't miss any unique remainders.\n- Looks correct. There are five distinct remainders.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Sum the Distinct Remainders to Find \\( m \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, I need to add up all the distinct remainders to get \\( m \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nm = 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 9 = 22\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Adding them up gives 22.\n- This seems reasonable given the remainders.\n- Quick mental check: 1 + 3 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8, 8 + 5 = 13, 13 + 9 = 22. Yep, that's correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Compute the Quotient of \\( m \\) Divided by 11**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Finally, I need to find the quotient when 22 is divided by 11.\n- This is straightforward division.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n22 \\div 11 = 2 \\quad \\text{(with a remainder of 0)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The quotient is 2, and there's no remainder.\n- Everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Reflection**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let me quickly review each step to ensure there are no errors:\n  - Squares were computed correctly.\n  - Remainders modulo 11 were accurate.\n  - Distinct remainders were identified without missing any.\n  - Sum of distinct remainders was correct.\n  - The final division yielded the correct quotient.\n\n- Everything seems to align perfectly.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n- Actually, looking back, the repeating patterns in the remainders confirm that only a limited set of remainders exist when squaring numbers within this range modulo 11. This reinforces the correctness of identifying distinct remainders.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully working through each step and verifying the calculations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The quotient when } m \\text{ is divided by } 11 \\text{ is } \\boxed{2}.\n\\]\n\n<ANSWER>solution: The quotient when \\( m \\) is divided by \\( 11 \\) is \\( \\boxed{2} \\).</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n- By systematically approaching the problem and verifying each step, I ensured accuracy in the final answer.\n- Starting with direct calculation was effective, but being open to adjusting the strategy if needed helped maintain flexibility.\n- Regular checks and reflections throughout the process prevented errors and confirmed the correctness of the solution.\n\nI hope this step-by-step exploration provides a clear understanding of how to tackle such problems systematically!",
  "ground_truth": "First notice that $(11-n)^2=11^2-2\\cdot 11+n^2\\equiv n^2\\pmod{11}$, and since we're asked to find distinct results, we only need to compute the squares of $n=1,2,3,4,5$. Respectively, $n^2\\equiv 1,4,9,5,3\\pmod{11}$. Thus, $1+4+9+5+3=22=11\\cdot\\boxed{2}$."
