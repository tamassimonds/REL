I'll ensure the flow is smooth and logical, capturing the human thought process authentically.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Problem: A Step-by-Step Reflection**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem just like I would if I were solving it on paper\u2014thinking it through, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nWhen I see the question:\n\n\"If \\( n = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^{14} \\cdot 5^{8} \\), how many of the natural-number factors of \\( n \\) are multiples of 150?\"\n\nMy first thought is that this involves understanding the factors of \\( n \\) that align with the prime factors of 150. I remember problems where identifying specific multiples required delving into prime factorizations.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **List All Factors:**  \n   - *Idea:* Generate all factors of \\( n \\) and filter those divisible by 150.  \n   - *Reflection:* This seems impractical given the large exponents\u2014too time-consuming.\n\n2. **Use Prime Factorization of 150:**  \n   - *Idea:* Determine which factors of \\( n \\) include the prime factors of 150.  \n   - *Reflection:* This appears more efficient. I think it's worth exploring.\n\n3. **Analyze Exponent Combinations:**  \n   - *Idea:* Consider how the exponents of \\( n \\)\u2019s prime factors can combine to include 150\u2019s factors.  \n   - *Reflection:* This sounds promising. Let's proceed with this strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Prime Factors Involved**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo ensure a factor of \\( n \\) is a multiple of 150, it must include 150's prime factors. So, breaking down 150 is essential.\n\n**Breaking Down 150:**  \n\\[ \n150 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 \n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \n- \\( 150 = 2 \\times 75 \\)  \n- \\( 75 = 3 \\times 25 \\)  \n- \\( 25 = 5 \\times 5 = 5^2 \\)  \n\n*Yup, that's correct.*\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAny factor of \\( n \\) that is a multiple of 150 must include at least \\( 2^1 \\), \\( 3^1 \\), and \\( 5^2 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluating \\( n \\)\u2019s Prime Factors**\n\n**Reflecting on \\( n \\):**  \nGiven:\n\n\\[\nn = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^{14} \\cdot 5^{8}\n\\]\n\n**Comparison with 150\u2019s Factors:**  \n- \\( 2^{10} \\) \u2192 *More than \\( 2^1 \\)*  \n- \\( 3^{14} \\) \u2192 *More than \\( 3^1 \\)*  \n- \\( 5^{8} \\) \u2192 *More than \\( 5^2 \\)*  \n\n**Thought Process:**  \n\\( n \\) has sufficient exponents for each prime factor required by 150. This means \\( n \\) can accommodate multiples of 150 within its factors.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWe can proceed to identify which factors of \\( n \\) are multiples of 150 by focusing on the exponents.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Total Factors of \\( n \\)**\n\n**Idea:**  \nFirst, let's find out how many total factors \\( n \\) has.\n\n**Using the Formula:**  \nTo find the total number of factors:\n\n\\[\n(10 + 1)(14 + 1)(8 + 1) = 11 \\times 15 \\times 9\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- \\( 11 \\times 15 = 165 \\)  \n- \\( 165 \\times 9 = 1,485 \\)  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, \\( n \\) has **1,485** total factors. But we need to narrow down to those that are multiples of 150.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying Factors That Are Multiples of 150**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWe need to find factors of \\( n \\) that include at least \\( 2^1 \\), \\( 3^1 \\), and \\( 5^2 \\). This involves selecting appropriate exponents for each prime factor.\n\n**Brainstorming:**  \n- **For \\( 2 \\):** Exponents can range from 1 to 10 (since \\( 2^0 \\) would exclude \\( 2^1 \\))  \n- **For \\( 3 \\):** Exponents can range from 1 to 14  \n- **For \\( 5 \\):** Exponents must be at least 2, so from 2 to 8  \n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis reminds me of combinatorics\u2014counting the number of valid combinations of exponents that meet these criteria.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nInitially, I thought about subtracting invalid combinations from the total, but directly calculating valid combinations seems more straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating Valid Exponent Combinations**\n\n**Breaking It Down:**  \n\n1. **Exponent of 2:**  \n   - Must be at least 1  \n   - Possible exponents: 1 to 10 \u2192 **10 choices**  \n\n2. **Exponent of 3:**  \n   - Must be at least 1  \n   - Possible exponents: 1 to 14 \u2192 **14 choices**  \n\n3. **Exponent of 5:**  \n   - Must be at least 2  \n   - Possible exponents: 2 to 8 \u2192 **7 choices**  \n\n**Calculating Total Combinations:**  \n\\[\n10 \\times 14 \\times 7 = 980\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThere are **980** factors of \\( n \\) that are multiples of 150. This calculation makes sense given the constraints on each exponent.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Verification Through a Smaller Example**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo ensure correctness, let's apply the same method to a smaller, manageable example.\n\n**Example:**  \nLet\u2019s say:\n\n\\[\nm = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1\n\\]\n\nAnd we want factors that are multiples of:\n\n\\[\n2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1\n\\]\n\n**Calculating Valid Exponents:**\n\n- **Exponent of 2:** 1 to 3 \u2192 **3 choices**  \n- **Exponent of 3:** 1 to 2 \u2192 **2 choices**  \n- **Exponent of 5:** 1 to 1 \u2192 **1 choice**  \n\n**Total Combinations:**  \n\\[\n3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\n\\]\n\n**Listing Them:**  \n- \\( 2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 \\)  \n- \\( 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 \\)  \n- \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 \\)  \n- \\( 2^1 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1 \\)  \n- \\( 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1 \\)  \n- \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1 \\)  \n\n**Check:**  \nThis matches the calculated total, confirming that the approach works.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe method is valid, and the original calculation for \\( n \\) holds true.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThere are **980** natural-number factors of \\( n \\) that are multiples of 150.  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy breaking down the problem into clear, manageable steps and continuously reflecting on each stage, I ensured the solution's accuracy. Brainstorming different strategies and being open to re-evaluating the approach helped streamline the process. Emulating a genuine human thought process, including moments of doubt and verification, reinforced the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Started with Understanding the Problem:**  \n  Realized it involved factors and multiples related to prime factorizations.\n\n- **Explored Multiple Strategies:**  \n  Initially considered listing all factors but pivoted to using prime factorization of 150 for efficiency.\n\n- **Calculated Total Factors:**  \n  Determined \\( n \\) has 1,485 total factors.\n\n- **Focused on Relevant Combinations:**  \n  Identified exponent combinations that include the necessary prime factors of 150.\n\n- **Verified with a Smaller Example:**  \n  Tested the approach on a simpler case to confirm validity.\n\n- **Arrived at the Final Answer:**  \n  Concluded that there are 980 factors of \\( n \\) that are multiples of 150.\n\nBy following this structured, reflective approach, I ensured that the final answer was both accurate and logically derived.",
  "ground_truth": "$150=2^13^15^2$.  Thus the coefficient of $2$ must be between $1$ and $10$, the coefficient of $3$ must be between $1$ and $14$, and the coefficient of $5$ must be between $2$ and $8$.  So the number of possible factors is\n\n$$(10)(14)(7)=\\boxed{980}$$"
