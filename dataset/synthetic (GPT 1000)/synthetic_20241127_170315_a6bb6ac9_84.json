  "problem": "The sum of two positive integers $a$ and $b$ is 1001.  What is the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often to check if I'm on the right path, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming**\n\n- **Wait a minute\u2026** The problem asks for the largest possible value of \\(\\gcd(a, b)\\) where \\(a + b = 1001\\). This reminds me of problems involving greatest common divisors (GCD) and sums, but I'm not entirely sure how to start.\n\n- **Maybe I can\u2026** Try breaking down the sum in different ways to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n- **Actually\u2026** This sounds similar to problems where the GCD is linked to the sum of numbers. Perhaps I can leverage properties of GCDs.\n\n- **But what if\u2026** I consider different pairs \\((a, b)\\) to see how their GCD behaves.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Strategy 1:** List Possible Pairs \\((a, b)\\)  \n   - **Thought:** If I list out different pairs that add up to 1001, maybe I can spot the largest GCD.\n   - **Reflection:** This might be time-consuming and inefficient. There are too many possibilities.\n\n2. **Strategy 2:** Use Properties of GCD  \n   - **Thought:** Wait, I remember that for two numbers, their GCD divides any linear combination of them. Maybe I can use this property.\n   - **Reflection:** This seems more promising. If the GCD divides both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it should also divide their sum, 1001.\n\n3. **Strategy 3:** Factorize 1001  \n   - **Thought:** If the GCD must divide 1001, perhaps I should factorize 1001 to find its divisors.\n   - **Reflection:** Yes, this makes sense. The largest GCD would be the largest divisor of 1001.\n\n### **Choosing a Strategy**\n\n- **Decision:** Strategy 3 sounds the most logical and efficient. By finding the largest divisor of 1001, I can determine the largest possible GCD of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution Using Strategy 3**\n\n**Step 1: Factorize 1001**\n\n- **Thought:** To find the divisors of 1001, I need to factorize it into its prime components.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - \\(1001 \\div 7 = 143\\) (since \\(1001\\) is divisible by \\(7\\))\n  - Now, factor \\(143\\):\n    - \\(143 \\div 11 = 13\\) (since \\(143\\) is divisible by \\(11\\))\n  - So, \\(1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13\\).\n\n- **Reflection:** Okay, I've broken down 1001 into prime factors. This means that the divisors of 1001 are products of these primes.\n\n**Step 2: List the Divisors of 1001**\n\n- **Thought:** The divisors of 1001 will be all possible products of its prime factors.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n\n  - \\(1\\) (since \\(1\\) divides everything)\n  - \\(7\\)\n  - \\(11\\)\n  - \\(13\\)\n  - \\(7 \\times 11 = 77\\)\n  - \\(7 \\times 13 = 91\\)\n  - \\(11 \\times 13 = 143\\)\n  - \\(7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 1001\\)\n\n- **Divisors:** \\(1, 7, 11, 13, 77, 91, 143, 1001\\)\n\n- **Quick Check:** Multiplying the factors back gives \\(1001\\), so the factorization is correct.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Largest Divisor**\n\n- **Thought:** The largest possible value of \\(\\gcd(a, b)\\) is the largest divisor of 1001.\n\n- **Largest Divisor:** \\(1001\\)\n\n- **Reflection:** If \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 1001\\), then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be multiples of 1001 that add up to 1001. Let's see if this is possible.\n\n**Step 4: Verify Possibility**\n\n- **Thought:** Can \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) both be multiples of 1001 and sum to 1001?\n\n- **Calculation:**\n\n  - Let\u2019s assume \\(a = 1001\\) and \\(b = 0\\).\n  - But the problem states that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are **positive integers**.\n\n- **Reflection:** Oops! \\(b = 0\\) is not a positive integer. This means that \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 1001\\) is **not possible** since both numbers need to be positive.\n\n**Step 5: Re-evaluate the Largest Possible GCD**\n\n- **Thought:** Since \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 1001\\) isn't feasible with both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) being positive, I need to consider the next largest divisor.\n\n- **Next Largest Divisor:** \\(143\\)\n\n- **Reflection:** Let's see if \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 143\\) is possible with \\(a + b = 1001\\).\n\n**Step 6: Constructing \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 143\\)**\n\n- **Thought:** If \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 143\\), then both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be multiples of 143.\n\n- **Let\u2019s Set:**\n\n  - \\(a = 143m\\)\n  - \\(b = 143n\\)\n  - Where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are positive integers, and \\(\\gcd(m, n) = 1\\) to ensure that 143 is the greatest common divisor.\n\n- **Equation:**\n\n  \\[\n  a + b = 143m + 143n = 1001\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying:**\n\n  \\[\n  143(m + n) = 1001\n  \\]\n  \n- **Solving for \\(m + n\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  m + n = \\frac{1001}{143} = 7\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** So, \\(m + n = 7\\). I need to find positive integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) that add up to 7 and are coprime.\n\n**Step 7: Finding Suitable \\(m\\) and \\(n\\)**\n\n- **Thought:** I need to select \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) such that their sum is 7 and their GCD is 1.\n\n- **Possible Pairs:**\n\n  - \\(m = 1\\), \\(n = 6\\)\n  - \\(m = 2\\), \\(n = 5\\)\n  - \\(m = 3\\), \\(n = 4\\)\n  - (And vice versa for each pair)\n\n- **Reflection:** All these pairs are coprime, so any of them would work.\n\n**Step 8: Constructing \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**\n\n- **Let\u2019s Choose:** \n\n  - \\(m = 2\\), \\(n = 5\\)\n\n- **Calculating \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):**\n\n  \\[\n  a = 143 \\times 2 = 286\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  b = 143 \\times 5 = 715\n  \\]\n  \n- **Verification:**\n\n  \\[\n  a + b = 286 + 715 = 1001\n  \\]\n  \n- **GCD Check:** \n\n  \\(\\gcd(286, 715) = 143\\)\n  \n- **Reflection:** Everything checks out. The sum is 1001, and the GCD is 143.\n\n**Step 9: Final Check**\n\n- **Thought:** Let me quickly verify if there's any possibility of a larger GCD that satisfies all conditions.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Since \\(1001\\) itself as a GCD isn't possible (both numbers need to be positive), and \\(143\\) is the next largest divisor, this must be the correct answer.\n\n- **Reflection:** I'm confident that \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 143\\) is indeed the largest possible value.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Using the Euclidean Algorithm**\n\n- **Thought:** Another way to approach this is by considering that the GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both without a remainder. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we can express the GCD in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n- **Implementation:**\n\n  - The Euclidean algorithm states that \\(\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b)\\).\n  - Since \\(a + b = 1001\\), we can express one variable in terms of the other: \\(a = 1001 - b\\).\n  - Thus, \\(\\gcd(1001 - b, b)\\) must divide 1001.\n\n- **Reflection:** This aligns with our previous strategy where the GCD must be a divisor of 1001. It reaffirms that factoring 1001 to find its largest divisor (that satisfies all conditions) is the correct approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe largest possible value of \\(\\gcd(a, b)\\) is **143**.\n\n---\n\n### **Wrapping Up:**\n\n- **Thought Process Recap:** Initially, I considered listing pairs and using basic GCD properties, but recognizing the inefficiency led me to factorize 1001. This approach enabled me to identify the largest possible GCD by examining its divisors.\n\n- **Verification:** By constructing \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as multiples of 143 that sum to 1001, I verified that the GCD is indeed 143.\n\n- **Final Reflection:** Multiple checks throughout the process ensured the correctness of the solution. Factoring the sum and leveraging the properties of GCD were key to solving the problem efficiently.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed, step-by-step exploration provides a clear understanding of how to approach and solve the problem, reflecting a natural human problem-solving process.",
  "ground_truth": "Note that $\\gcd(a,b)$ divides both $a$ and $b$, so $\\gcd(a,b)$ must also divide $a + b = 1001$.  Clearly, $\\gcd(a,b)$ cannot be equal to 1001 (because both $a$ and $b$ must be less than 1001).  The next-largest divisor of 1001 is 143.  If $a = 143$ and $b = 1001 - 143 = 858$, then $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(143,858) = 143$.  Therefore, the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ is $\\boxed{143}$."
