  "problem": "A function $f$ is defined for all real numbers and satisfies $f(2+x)=f(2-x)$ and $f(7+x)=f(7-x)$ for all $x.$ If $f(0) = 0,$ what is the least number of roots $f(x)=0$ must have in the interval $-1000\\leq x \\leq 1000$?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem involving the function \\( f \\), we will analyze its symmetries and identify the roots based on these symmetries.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Symmetries\nThe function \\( f \\) has two key symmetries:\n1. **Symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\)**: \\( f(2 + x) = f(2 - x) \\)\n2. **Symmetry about \\( x = 7 \\)**: \\( f(7 + x) = f(7 - x) \\)\n\n### Step 2: Finding Initial Roots\nWe know that \\( f(0) = 0 \\). Using the symmetry around \\( x = 2 \\):\n- From \\( f(0) = 0 \\):\n  \\[\n  f(4) = f(2 - (2 - 0)) = f(0) = 0.\n  \\]\n  Thus, \\( f(4) = 0 \\).\n\nUsing the symmetry around \\( x = 7 \\):\n- Similarly,\n  \\[\n  f(14) = f(7 + (7 - 0)) = f(0) = 0.\n  \\]\n  Thus, \\( f(14) = 0 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Known Roots Summary\nWe have identified three specific roots:\n1. \\( x = 0 \\)\n2. \\( x = 4 \\)\n3. \\( x = 14 \\)\n\n### Step 4: Exploring Additional Roots\nThe symmetries suggest further roots exist. \n\nFrom \\( f(0) = 0 \\) and symmetry about \\( x = 2 \\), we can generate roots like:\n- \\( f(10) = f(2 + (10 - 2)) = f(2 - (10 - 2)) = f(4) = 0 \\).\n\nFrom symmetry around \\( x = 7 \\):\n- Additional roots can also be established, leading to potential roots in sequences.\n\n### Step 5: Identifying Patterns\n- From \\( f(0) \\), generating roots gives: \\( 0, 10, 20, \\ldots \\) (all of the form \\( 10n \\)).\n- From \\( f(4) \\), we find roots of the form \\( 4 + 10n \\): \\( 4, 14, 24, \\ldots \\).\n\n### Step 6: Counting Roots in the Interval\nTo count how many roots exist in the interval \\([-1000, 1000]\\):\n\n1. **Roots of the form \\( 10n \\)**:\n   \\[\n   -1000 \\leq 10n \\leq 1000 \\implies -100 \\leq n \\leq 100.\n   \\]\n   This yields \\( 201 \\) values.\n\n2. **Roots of the form \\( 4 + 10n \\)**:\n   \\[\n   -1000 \\leq 4 + 10n \\leq 1000 \\implies -1004 \\leq 10n \\leq 996 \\implies -100.4 \\leq n \\leq 99.6.\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( n \\) ranges from \\( -100 \\) to \\( 99 \\), giving \\( 200 \\) values.\n\n### Step 7: Total Count of Roots\nThe total number of distinct roots is:\n- From \\( 10n \\): \\( 201 \\)\n- From \\( 4 + 10n \\): \\( 200 \\)\n\nThus, the total is:\n\\[\n201 + 200 = 401.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the least number of roots \\( f(x) = 0 \\) must have in the interval \\([-1000, 1000]\\) is \\( \\boxed{401} \\).",
  "ground_truth": "The first equation is equivalent to the following: if $a + b = 4$, then $f(a) = f(b)$. Similarly, the second equation is equivalent to the following: if $c + d = 14$, then $f(c) = f(d)$.\n\nThen note that for any $t$, we have \\[f(t) = f(4-t) = f(t+10),\\]because $t + (4-t) = 4$ and $(4-t) + (t+10) = 14$. This means that if $t$ is a root of $f$, then so is $t+10$, and conversely, if $t+10$ is a root of $f$, then so is $t$. Since $t = 0$ is a root, we see that if $n$ is a multiple of $10$, then $f(n) = 0$. We also have $f(4) = f(0)=0$, so if $n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}$, then $f(n) = 0$.\n\nTo see that these are all the necessary roots, observe that \\[f(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} 0 & \\quad \\text{if } x \\text{ is an integer and either } x \\equiv 0 \\! \\! \\! \\! \\pmod{10} \\text{ or } x \\equiv 4 \\!\\ \\! \\! \\! \\pmod{10} \\\\ 1 & \\quad \\text{otherwise} \\end{aligned} \\right.\\]satisfies all the given conditions, and only has these roots. This is because if $a+b=4$ and $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}$, then $b \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}$, and vice versa. Similarly, if $c + d = 14$ and $c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}$, then $d \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}$, and vice versa.\n\nThere are $201$ multiples of $10$ in the given interval, and $200$ integers that are $4$ modulo $10$ in the given interval, making $201 + 200 = \\boxed{401}$ roots of $f.$"
