  "solution": "To solve for the number of ordered pairs of nonempty sets \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) with the specified properties, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Set Definition\nWe define the sets such that:\n- \\(\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B} = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 12\\}\\)\n- \\(\\mathcal{A} \\cap \\mathcal{B} = \\emptyset\\)\n\nThis means that each element from 1 to 12 must be in either \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) or \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) but not in both.\n\n### Step 2: Set Sizes\nLet \\(m\\) denote the number of elements in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(n\\) be the number in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\). We have:\n\\[\nm + n = 12\n\\]\nwith the condition that \\(m, n \\geq 1\\).\n\n### Step 3: Restrictions on Set Sizes\nThe problem imposes additional restrictions:\n- The size \\(m\\) cannot be an element of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).\n- The size \\(n\\) cannot be an element of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\).\n\n### Step 4: Valid Values for \\(m\\) and \\(n\\)\nGiven \\(m\\) can range from 1 to 11, we denote:\n- If \\(m = k\\), then \\(n = 12 - k\\).\n- Therefore, \\(k\\) (the size of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)) must not be included in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), and similarly for \\(n\\).\n\n### Step 5: Counting Configurations\nWe enumerate valid configurations for each possible value of \\(k\\):\n\n1. **\\(k = 1\\) (then \\(n = 11\\))**:\n   - \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) can have one element from \\(\\{2, 3, \\ldots, 12\\}\\): **11 choices**.\n\n2. **\\(k = 2\\) (then \\(n = 10\\))**:\n   - Choose 2 from \\(\\{1, 3, 4, \\ldots, 12\\}\\): \\(\\binom{10}{2} = 45\\).\n\n3. **\\(k = 3\\) (then \\(n = 9\\))**:\n   - Choose 3 from \\(\\{1, 2, 4, \\ldots, 12\\}\\): \\(\\binom{10}{3} = 120\\).\n\n4. **\\(k = 4\\) (then \\(n = 8\\))**:\n   - Choose 4 from \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 5, \\ldots, 12\\}\\): \\(\\binom{10}{4} = 210\\).\n\n5. **\\(k = 5\\) (then \\(n = 7\\))**:\n   - Choose 5 from \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\}\\): \\(\\binom{10}{5} = 252\\).\n\n6. **\\(k = 6\\) (then \\(n = 6\\))**:\n   - Choose 6 from \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\}\\): \\(\\binom{10}{6} = 210\\).\n\n7. **\\(k = 7\\) (then \\(n = 5\\))**:\n   - Choose 7 from \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\}\\): \\(\\binom{10}{7} = 120\\).\n\n8. **\\(k = 8\\) (then \\(n = 4\\))**:\n   - Choose 8 from \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12\\}\\): \\(\\binom{10}{8} = 45\\).\n\n9. **\\(k = 9\\) (then \\(n = 3\\))**:\n   - Choose 9 from \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12\\}\\): \\(\\binom{10}{9} = 10\\).\n\n10. **\\(k = 10\\) (then \\(n = 2\\))**:\n    - Choose 10 from \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12\\}\\): \\(\\binom{10}{10} = 1\\).\n\n11. **\\(k = 11\\) (then \\(n = 1\\))**:\n    - \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) can only be \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 11\\}: **1 choice**.\n\n### Step 6: Summing Configurations\nNow we calculate the total number of valid configurations, excluding \\(k = 6\\) (where \\(m\\) equals 6, which is impossible to include):\n\n\\[\nN = 11 + 45 + 120 + 210 + 252 + 210 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1 - 252\n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\nN = 772\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe total number of ordered pairs of nonempty sets \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) that meet all the criteria is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{772}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let us partition the set $\\{1,2,\\cdots,12\\}$ into $n$ numbers in $A$ and $12-n$ numbers in $B$,\nSince $n$ must be in $B$ and $12-n$ must be in $A$ ($n\\ne6$, we cannot partition into two sets of 6 because $6$ needs to end up somewhere, $n\\ne 0$ or $12$ either).\nWe have $\\dbinom{10}{n-1}$ ways of picking the numbers to be in $A$.\nSo the answer is $\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{11} \\dbinom{10}{n-1}\\right) - \\dbinom{10}{5}=2^{10}-252= \\boxed{772}$."
