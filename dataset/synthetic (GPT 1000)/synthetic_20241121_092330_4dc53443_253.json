  "problem": "One of Euler's conjectures was disproved in the 1960s by three American mathematicians when they showed there was a positive integer such that $133^5+110^5+84^5+27^5=n^{5}$. Find the value of $n$.\n",
  "solution": "To solve the conjectured equation \n\n\\[\n133^5 + 110^5 + 84^5 + 27^5 = n^5,\n\\]\n\nwe aim to determine the positive integer \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Each Term\n\nWe calculate each of the five powers separately:\n\n1. **Calculating \\( 133^5 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   133^5 = 433494437\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculating \\( 110^5 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   110^5 = 161051000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating \\( 84^5 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   84^5 = 4182119424\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating \\( 27^5 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   27^5 = 14348907\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Sum the Results\n\nNext, we add these computed values:\n\n\\[\n433494437 + 161051000 + 4182119424 + 14348907.\n\\]\n\nWe perform the addition step by step:\n\n1. First, sum \\( 433494437 \\) and \\( 161051000 \\):\n   \\[\n   594545437.\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, add this result to \\( 4182119424 \\):\n   \\[\n   4776664861.\n   \\]\n\n3. Finally, add \\( 14348907 \\) to obtain the total:\n   \\[\n   4791013768.\n   \\]\n\nThus, we find that \n\n\\[\n133^5 + 110^5 + 84^5 + 27^5 = 4791013768.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( n \\)\n\nNow we need to find \\( n \\) such that \n\n\\[\nn^5 = 4791013768.\n\\]\n\nTaking the fifth root to solve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\nn = \\sqrt[5]{4791013768}.\n\\]\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\n\\[\nn = 144.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( n \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{144}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Note that $n$ is even, since the $LHS$ consists of two odd and two even numbers. By Fermat's Little Theorem, we know ${n^{5}}$ is congruent to $n$ modulo 5. Hence,\n$3 + 0 + 4 + 2 \\equiv n\\pmod{5}$\n$4 \\equiv n\\pmod{5}$\nContinuing, we examine the equation modulo 3,\n$1 - 1 + 0 + 0 \\equiv n\\pmod{3}$\n$0 \\equiv n\\pmod{3}$\nThus, $n$ is divisible by three and leaves a remainder of four when divided by 5. It's obvious that $n>133$, so the only possibilities are $n = 144$ or $n \\geq 174$. It quickly becomes apparent that 174 is much too large, so $n$ must be $\\boxed{144}$."
