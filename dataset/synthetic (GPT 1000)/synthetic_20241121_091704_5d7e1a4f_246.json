  "problem": "How many positive integers smaller than $1{,}000{,}000$ are powers of $2$, but are not powers of $8$? You may find it useful to consider that $2^{10}=1024$.",
  "solution": "To determine how many positive integers smaller than 1,000,000 are powers of 2 but not powers of 8, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Count the Powers of 2 Less Than 1,000,000\n\nA number is a power of 2 if it can be expressed as \\(2^n\\) for a non-negative integer \\(n\\). We need to find the largest \\(n\\) such that \\(2^n < 1,000,000\\).\n\n- Noting that \\(2^{20} = 1,048,576\\) (which exceeds 1,000,000) and \\(2^{19} = 524,288\\) (which is less than 1,000,000), we see that \\(n\\) can take values from \\(0\\) to \\(19\\).\n- This gives us \\(20\\) valid powers of 2:\n\n\\[\nn = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 19 \\quad \\text{(20 values)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Count the Powers of 8 Less Than 1,000,000\n\nNext, we consider which powers of 2 are also powers of 8. Since a power of 8 can be expressed as \\(8^m = (2^3)^m = 2^{3m}\\), we need to find the largest \\(m\\) such that \\(3m < 20\\).\n\n- The maximum \\(m\\) that satisfies this condition is \\(6\\) (since \\(3 \\times 6 = 18\\)).\n- The powers of 8 that are less than 1,000,000 are:\n  - \\(8^0 = 1\\) (which is \\(2^0\\))\n  - \\(8^1 = 8\\) (which is \\(2^3\\))\n  - \\(8^2 = 64\\) (which is \\(2^6\\))\n  - \\(8^3 = 512\\) (which is \\(2^9\\))\n  - \\(8^4 = 4096\\) (which is \\(2^{12}\\))\n  - \\(8^5 = 32768\\) (which is \\(2^{15}\\))\n  - \\(8^6 = 262144\\) (which is \\(2^{18}\\))\n\nThis gives us \\(7\\) valid powers of 8.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Powers of 2 That Are Not Powers of 8\n\nFinally, to find the count of positive integers that are powers of 2 but not powers of 8, we subtract the number of powers of 8 from the total number of powers of 2:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Powers of 2 not powers of 8} = \\text{Total powers of 2} - \\text{Total powers of 8} = 20 - 7 = 13\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of positive integers smaller than 1,000,000 that are powers of 2 but not powers of 8 is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{13}\\)",
  "ground_truth": "The hint is useful because it tells us that $2^{20}$ is equal to $1024^2$, which is slightly more than $1{,}000{,}000$, but is clearly less than $2{,}000{,}000$. Therefore, the largest power of $2$ which is less than $1{,}000{,}000$ is $2^{19}$. This tells us that $20$ of the integers smaller than $1{,}000{,}000$ are powers of $2$: $$2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \\ldots, 2^{17}, 2^{18}, 2^{19}.$$\n\nHowever, we have to exclude the $7$ numbers $$2^0, 2^3, 2^6, 2^9, 2^{12}, 2^{15}, 2^{18}$$ from our count, because these are all powers of $8$ (in general, $2^{3n}$ is the same as $(2^3)^n$, which is $8^n$). That leaves us with $20-7 = \\boxed{13}$ powers of $2$ that aren't powers of $8$."
