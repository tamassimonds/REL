  "solution": "To find the fraction of the area of the larger square that is occupied by the shaded square, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Area of the Larger Square:**\n   The grid forms a larger square with vertices at (0,0) and (4,4). The side length of this square is 4 units. Therefore, the area of the larger square is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of larger square} = \\text{side}^2 = 4^2 = 16 \\text{ square units.}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Vertices of the Shaded Square:**\n   The points defining the shaded square are (2,2), (3,3), (2,4), and (1,3). These points form a square rotated 45 degrees relative to the coordinate axes.\n\n3. **Area of the Shaded Square:**\n   To compute the area of the shaded square, we need the length of its diagonal. We can find this by measuring the distance between two opposite vertices, such as (2,2) and (2,4):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of diagonal} = \\sqrt{(2-2)^2 + (4-2)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{4} = 2.\n   \\]\n   The area of a square can also be derived from the diagonal length (d) using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{d^2}{2}.\n   \\]\n   Substituting in the length of the diagonal:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{2^2}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\text{ square units.}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Fraction of the Areas:**\n   Now we can find the fraction of the larger square's area that the shaded square occupies:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\text{Area of shaded square}}{\\text{Area of larger square}} = \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{8}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   Thus, the fraction of the area of the larger square that is contained within the shaded square is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}.\n   \\]",
  "ground_truth": "Since the side of the shaded square is a diagonal of the smaller squares, it has area $(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$ square units. The whole grid has area $4^2 = 16$ units, so the ratio of areas is $\\frac{2}{16} =\\boxed{\\frac 18}$."
