  "problem": "Two congruent right circular cones each with base radius $3$ and height $8$ have the axes of symmetry that intersect at right angles at a point in the interior of the cones a distance $3$ from the base of each cone. A sphere with radius $r$ lies withing both cones. The maximum possible value of $r^2$ is $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n",
  "solution": "To determine the maximum possible value of \\( r^2 \\) for a sphere fitting inside two congruent right circular cones that intersect at right angles, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Coordinate System\nWe position the first cone with its apex at \\( (0, 0, 8) \\) and the center of its base at the origin \\( (0, 0, 0) \\). The second cone has its apex at \\( (3, 0, 8) \\) (shifted along the x-axis) and its base center at \\( (3, 0, 0) \\).\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Cone Equations\nThe equation for the first cone, opening downward along the z-axis, is derived from its geometry:\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{3^2} = \\frac{(8 - z)^2}{8^2} \\implies x^2 + y^2 = \\frac{9(8 - z)^2}{64}.\n\\]\nFor the second cone, similarly, we derive the equation:\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 + y^2 = \\frac{9(8 - z)^2}{64}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Sphere's Radius\nWe focus on the cross-section of the intersecting cones to locate the center of the sphere along the z-axis. The optimal position for the sphere's center is found at a height of \\( z = 5 \\) (since the sphere must lie within both cones).\n\n### Step 4: Applying Similar Triangles\nUsing the geometry of the cones, we analyze two triangles formed by the cone's structure and the tangential points of the sphere:\n- The height from the apex to the base is \\( 8 \\).\n- The horizontal distance from the apex to the center of the sphere is \\( 3 \\).\n\nUsing similar triangles, we relate the heights as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{BC}{AB} = \\frac{r}{AD},\n\\] \nwhere \\( AB = 8 \\) (total height) and \\( AD = 3 \\) (horizontal distance to where the sphere is tangent).\n\n### Step 5: Relationship Between Sphere Radius and Cones\nUsing the similarity ratios, we express:\n\\[\nCE = AD \\cdot \\frac{BC}{AB} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{r}{8},\n\\]\nwhich gives a method to compute the radius \\( r \\).\n\n### Step 6: Calculate \\( r \\) and \\( r^2 \\)\nSubstituting the known height of the sphere, we find:\n\\[\nr = 3 \\cdot \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{8^2 + 3^2}} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{64 + 9}} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{73}}.\n\\]\nSquaring \\( r \\) gives:\n\\[\nr^2 = \\left(3 \\cdot \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{73}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{225}{73}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Final Parameters\nIn the simplified fraction for \\( r^2 \\), we identify \\( m = 225 \\) and \\( n = 73 \\), with both being coprime positive integers.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe final sum of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) is:\n\\[\nm+n = 225 + 73 = 298.\n\\]\nThus, the solution is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{298}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Consider the cross section of the cones and sphere by a plane that contains the two axes of symmetry of the cones as shown below. The sphere with maximum radius will be tangent to the sides of each of the cones. The center of that sphere must be on the axis of symmetry of each of the cones and thus must be at the intersection of their axes of symmetry. Let $A$ be the point in the cross section where the bases of the cones meet, and let $C$ be the center of the sphere. Let the axis of symmetry of one of the cones extend from its vertex, $B$, to the center of its base, $D$. Let the sphere be tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ at $E$.
