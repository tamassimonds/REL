  "solution": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper\u2014brainstorming different strategies, checking for correctness along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the question, I see it's about a quadratic function \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) with specific properties:\n\n1. **Maximum value is 5 at \\( x = 3 \\).**\n2. **Passes through the point \\( (0, -13) \\).**\n3. **Find \\( m \\) such that the graph passes through \\( (4, m) \\).**\n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n\n- **Vertex Form:** Since there's a maximum value at \\( x = 3 \\), maybe I can use the vertex form of a quadratic.\n- **Standard Form Coefficients:** Alternatively, I could find \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) using the given points.\n- **Symmetry of Parabolas:** Perhaps exploiting the symmetry could help.\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards using the **vertex form** because it directly involves the maximum point. But let\u2019s explore multiple strategies to ensure I\u2019m on the right path.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Use Vertex Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe vertex form of a quadratic is:\n\n\\[\ny = a(x - h)^2 + k\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( (h, k) \\) is the vertex. Given that the maximum is 5 at \\( x = 3 \\), I can set \\( h = 3 \\) and \\( k = 5 \\).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\ny = a(x - 3)^2 + 5\n\\]\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- Use the point \\( (0, -13) \\) to find \\( a \\).\n- Then, use the point \\( (4, m) \\) to find \\( m \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Plug in \\( (0, -13) \\):**\n\n\\[\n-13 = a(0 - 3)^2 + 5 \\\\\n-13 = 9a + 5\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( a \\):**\n\n\\[\n-13 - 5 = 9a \\\\\n-18 = 9a \\\\\na = -2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense because \\( a \\) is negative, indicating the parabola opens downwards, which aligns with having a maximum point.\n\n2. **Now, plug in \\( (4, m) \\):**\n\n\\[\nm = -2(4 - 3)^2 + 5 \\\\\nm = -2(1) + 5 \\\\\nm = -2 + 5 \\\\\nm = 3\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis seems straightforward, but let me verify by considering another strategy to ensure correctness.\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Use Standard Form Coefficients**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe using the standard form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) and setting up equations based on the given points would work.\n\nGiven:\n\n1. Maximum at \\( x = 3 \\), so the derivative \\( y' = 0 \\) at \\( x = 3 \\).\n2. Passes through \\( (0, -13) \\).\n3. Need to find \\( m \\) at \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- Find \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\).\n- Use the given points to solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Derivative \\( y' = 2ax + b \\):**\n\nAt \\( x = 3 \\), \\( y' = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n0 = 2a(3) + b \\\\\n0 = 6a + b \\\\\nb = -6a\n\\]\n\n2. **Use point \\( (0, -13) \\):**\n\n\\[\n-13 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c \\\\\nc = -13\n\\]\n\n3. **Equation so far:**\n\n\\[\ny = ax^2 - 6ax - 13\n\\]\n\n4. **Find \\( a \\) using maximum value at \\( x = 3 \\):**\n\n\\[\ny(3) = 9a - 18a - 13 = 5 \\\\\n-9a - 13 = 5 \\\\\n-9a = 18 \\\\\na = -2\n\\]\n\n5. **Find \\( b \\):**\n\n\\[\nb = -6(-2) = 12\n\\]\n\n6. **Final equation:**\n\n\\[\ny = -2x^2 + 12x - 13\n\\]\n\n7. **Now, find \\( m \\) at \\( x = 4 \\):**\n\n\\[\nm = -2(4)^2 + 12(4) - 13 \\\\\nm = -32 + 48 - 13 \\\\\nm = 16 - 13 \\\\\nm = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth strategies yield \\( m = 3 \\). This consistency suggests that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Does the value of \\( a \\) make sense? Yes, \\( a = -2 \\) indicates a downward-opening parabola, which aligns with having a maximum point.\n- Is the maximum value correctly achieved at \\( x = 3 \\)? Plugging back into the equation confirms this.\n- Both strategies agree on the value of \\( m \\), adding confidence to the solution.\n\n**Additional Check:**\n\nLet me quickly verify by substituting back into the original equation to ensure no arithmetic mistakes were made.\n\n1. **Using the final equation \\( y = -2x^2 + 12x - 13 \\):**\n\n   - At \\( x = 3 \\):\n     \n     \\[\n     y = -2(3)^2 + 12(3) - 13 = -18 + 36 - 13 = 5\n     \\]\n     \n     This matches the given maximum value.\n\n   - At \\( x = 0 \\):\n     \n     \\[\n     y = -13\n     \\]\n     \n     This matches the given point \\( (0, -13) \\).\n\n   - At \\( x = 4 \\):\n     \n     \\[\n     m = -32 + 48 - 13 = 3\n     \\]\n     \n     This confirms the solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll checks are consistent with the given properties, so the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(\\boxed{m = 3}\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Brainstormed multiple strategies:** Initially considered using the vertex form and standard form coefficients.\n- **Applied both strategies:** Found \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) using given points and properties.\n- **Checked consistency:** Both methods agreed on the value of \\( m \\), and additional checks confirmed correctness.\n- **Finalized the answer:** \\( m = 3 \\).\n\nBy thoroughly exploring different approaches and verifying each step, I ensured the accuracy of the solution.",
  "ground_truth": "Since the maximum value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is 5, which occurs at $x = 3$, this tells us that the vertex of the parabola is $(3,5)$.  Hence, the quadratic is of the form $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5$, where $a$ is a negative number.  (We know that $a$ is negative because $y$ has a maximum value.)\n\nWe are also told that the graph passes through the point $(0,-13)$.  Substituting these coordinates into the equation $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5$, we get $-13 = 9a + 5$, so $a = (-5 - 13)/9 = -18/9 = -2$.  Therefore, the equation is $y =- 2(x - 3)^2+5$.\n\nWhen $x = 4$, we have $m = - 2 \\cdot 1^2 + 5 = \\boxed{3}$."
