  "problem": "For how many three-digit positive integers is the sum of the digits equal to $5?$",
  "solution": "To find how many three-digit integers have digits that sum to 5, we denote a three-digit number as \\(abc\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are its digits. Here, \\(a\\) is the hundreds digit, \\(b\\) is the tens digit, and \\(c\\) is the units digit. Since \\(abc\\) is a three-digit integer, the hundreds digit \\(a\\) must be at least 1, while \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) can range from 0 to 9.\n\nWe start with the equation for the sum of the digits:\n\n\\[\na + b + c = 5.\n\\]\n\nTo account for the constraint that \\(a \\geq 1\\), we redefine \\(a\\) by letting \\(a' = a - 1\\). This gives us:\n\n\\[\n(a' + 1) + b + c = 5 \\implies a' + b + c = 4.\n\\]\n\nNow, \\(a'\\) must be a non-negative integer, ranging from 0 to 4, while \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) can also be any non-negative integers. We need to count the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n\n\\[\na' + b + c = 4.\n\\]\n\nTo find the number of solutions, we will use the \"stars and bars\" theorem, which is a combinatorial method for distributing indistinguishable objects (stars) into distinct bins (bars). The number of ways to distribute \\(n\\) indistinguishable objects into \\(k\\) distinguishable bins is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}.\n\\]\n\nIn our case, \\(n = 4\\) (the total we want to sum to) and \\(k = 3\\) (the three variables \\(a'\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\)). Plugging in these values gives:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{6}{2}.\n\\]\n\nNow we compute \\( \\binom{6}{2} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15.\n\\]\n\nConsequently, we conclude that there are 15 distinct three-digit integers where the sum of the digits equals 5. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let the three digit integer be $abc.$ We must have $a+b+c=5,$ and $a\\geq 1.$ Let $d=a-1.$ Then $d,$ $b,$ and $c$ are all nonnegative integers with $d+b+c=4.$ We can view this as placing two dividers among four dots, which can be done in a total of $\\binom{6}{2}=\\boxed{15}$ ways."
