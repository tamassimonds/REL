  "problem": "Melinda has three empty boxes and $12$ textbooks, three of which are mathematics textbooks. One box will hold any three of her textbooks, one will hold any four of her textbooks, and one will hold any five of her textbooks. If Melinda packs her textbooks into these boxes in random order, the probability that all three mathematics textbooks end up in the same box can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process step by step, just like how I would naturally tackle it in real life. I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, check my work frequently, and adjust as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Okay, Melinda needs to pack 12 textbooks into three boxes with specific capacities (3, 4, and 5 books). There are three mathematics textbooks, and we need to find the probability that all three end up in the same box. This sounds like a probability problem involving combinations.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Total Ways to Pack:** Calculate the total number of ways to distribute the textbooks and then find the number of favorable outcomes where all math books are in the same box.\n  2. **Complement Probability:** Maybe it's easier to calculate the probability that the math books are not all in the same box and subtract from 1.\n  3. **Direct Assignment:** Assign textbooks to boxes randomly and see which assignments work.\n\n- **Preference:** I think starting with the total ways to pack and then focusing on the favorable outcomes makes sense. But I'll keep the complement probability in mind if the first approach gets too complicated.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Total Ways to Pack the Textbooks**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** Before jumping in, I realize I need to know the total number of ways to distribute all 12 textbooks into the three boxes to have a denominator for the probability.\n\n- **Thinking Combinatorially:** This reminds me of partitioning a set into subsets of fixed sizes. I can use combinations to determine how to select books for each box.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Choose 3 Books for the First Box:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{12}{3} = 220\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choose 4 Books for the Second Box from the Remaining 9:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{9}{4} = 126\n   \\]\n\n3. **The Remaining 5 Books Automatically Go to the Third Box:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{5} = 1\n   \\]\n\n**Total Ways:**\n\\[\n220 \\times 126 \\times 1 = 27,720\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, by selecting books sequentially for each box, I've covered all possible arrangements.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identify Favorable Outcomes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Next Step:** Now, I need to calculate the number of ways to pack the textbooks such that all three mathematics textbooks end up in the same box.\n\n- **Wait, Let Me Think:** I can consider each box separately and determine the number of ways all math books can be in that box.\n\n#### **Case 1: All Math Books in the Box of 3**\n\n1. **Choose 3 Math Books for This Box:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{3} = 1\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Choose 4 Books for the Box of 4 from the Remaining 9:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{9}{4} = 126\n   \\]\n   \n3. **The Remaining 5 Books Go to the Box of 5:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{5} = 1\n   \\]\n   \n**Total for This Case:**\n\\[\n1 \\times 126 \\times 1 = 126\n\\]\n\n#### **Case 2: All Math Books in the Box of 4**\n\n1. **Choose 3 Math Books for This Box:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{3} = 1\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Choose 3 Books for the Box of 3 from the Remaining 9:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{9}{3} = 84\n   \\]\n   \n3. **The Remaining 6 Books Go to the Box of 5:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{5} = 6\n   \\]\n   \n**Total for This Case:**\n\\[\n1 \\times 84 \\times 6 = 504\n\\]\n\n#### **Case 3: All Math Books in the Box of 5**\n\n1. **Choose 3 Math Books for This Box:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{3} = 1\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Choose 3 Books for the Box of 3 from the Remaining 9:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{9}{3} = 84\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Choose 4 Books for the Box of 4 from the Remaining 6:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{4} = 15\n   \\]\n   \n**Total for This Case:**\n\\[\n1 \\times 84 \\times 15 = 1,260\n\\]\n\n#### **Adding Up Favorable Outcomes**\n\n\\[\n126 + 504 + 1,260 = 1,890\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Adding up the cases where all math books are in one box seems reasonable. The largest number comes from placing them in the largest box, which makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Wait, Let Me Double-Check:** So, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of ways to pack the textbooks.\n\n- **Formula:** \n  \\[\n  P(\\text{All math books in one box}) = \\frac{\\text{Favorable Outcomes}}{\\text{Total Outcomes}} = \\frac{1,890}{27,720}\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplifying the Fraction:** I need to reduce this fraction to its simplest form to find \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1,890}{27,720}\n\\]\n\n- **Divide Both Numerator and Denominator by 10:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{189}{2,772}\n  \\]\n\n- **Look for Common Factors:** Let's see if 189 and 2,772 have common factors.\n\n- **Factorizing 189:**\n  \\[\n  189 = 3^3 \\times 7\n  \\]\n  \n- **Factorizing 2,772:**\n  \\[\n  2,772 = 2^2 \\times 3^3 \\times 7 \\times 11\n  \\]\n  \n- **Common Factors:** Both have \\( 3^3 \\times 7 = 189 \\).\n\n- **Divide Both by 189:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{189 \\div 189}{2,772 \\div 189} = \\frac{1}{14.6667}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Wait, That Can't Be Right:** Hmm, dividing by 189 seems off because the denominator should be an integer. Let me recheck my factorization.\n\n- **Let Me Try Again:**\n  \n  - **Actually:** Instead of dividing by 189 directly, let's simplify step by step.\n  \n  - **Divide Numerator and Denominator by 3:**\n    \\[\n    \\frac{189 \\div 3}{2,772 \\div 3} = \\frac{63}{924}\n    \\]\n  \n  - **Divide Again by 3:**\n    \\[\n    \\frac{63 \\div 3}{924 \\div 3} = \\frac{21}{308}\n    \\]\n  \n  - **Divide by 7:**\n    \\[\n    \\frac{21 \\div 7}{308 \\div 7} = \\frac{3}{44}\n    \\]\n  \n  - **Final Simplified Fraction:**\n    \\[\n    \\frac{3}{44}\n    \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, \\( \\frac{3}{44} \\) seems reasonable for a probability. Calculation steps now align correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Compute \\( m + n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Final Calculation:** According to the problem, the probability is \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime. We found \\( \\frac{3}{44} \\), so \\( m = 3 \\) and \\( n = 44 \\).\n\n- **Calculate \\( m + n \\):**\n  \\[\n  m + n = 3 + 44 = 47\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Adding 3 and 44 gives 47, which is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\nm + n = 47\n\\]\n\n**Probability:**\n\\[\nP(\\text{All math books in one box}) = \\frac{3}{44}\n\\]\n\n**Summary:** By calculating the total number of ways to pack the textbooks and the favorable outcomes where all mathematics books are in the same box, we determined the probability and simplified it to find \\( m + n = 47 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Checks**\n\n- **Revisiting the Approach:** Starting with calculating the total ways and then focusing on favorable outcomes worked well. Complement probability wasn't necessary, but it's always good to consider multiple strategies.\n\n- **Multiple Checks:** Simplifying the fraction step by step helped avoid errors. Initial attempts at dividing by large factors led to confusion, but breaking it down ensured accuracy.\n\n- **Learning Moment:** Mistakes in factorization reminded me to double-check calculations and not rush through simplification.\n\n- **Confidence in the Solution:** After verifying each step and correcting initial errors, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n---\n\nThere we go! By thinking through the problem methodically, checking our work regularly, and being open to adjusting our approach, we've successfully found the solution.",
  "ground_truth": "The total ways the textbooks can be arranged in the 3 boxes is $12\\textbf{C}3\\cdot 9\\textbf{C}4$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{12\\cdot 11\\cdot 10\\cdot 9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7\\cdot 6}{144}=12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot7\\cdot3$. If all of the math textbooks are put into the box that can hold $3$ textbooks, there are $9!/(4!\\cdot 5!)=9\\textbf{C}4$ ways for the other textbooks to be arranged. If all of the math textbooks are put into the box that can hold $4$ textbooks, there are $9$ ways to choose the other book in that box, times $8\\textbf{C}3$ ways for the other books to be arranged. If all of the math textbooks are put into the box with the capability of holding $5$ textbooks, there are $9\\textbf{C}2$ ways to choose the other 2 textbooks in that box, times $7\\textbf{C}3$ ways to arrange the other 7 textbooks. $9\\textbf{C}4=9\\cdot7\\cdot2=126$, $9\\cdot 8\\textbf{C}3=9\\cdot8\\cdot7=504$, and $9\\textbf{C}2\\cdot 7\\textbf{C}3=9\\cdot7\\cdot5\\cdot4=1260$, so the total number of ways the math textbooks can all be placed into the same box is $126+504+1260=1890$. So, the probability of this occurring is $\\frac{(9\\cdot7)(2+8+(4\\cdot5))}{12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot7\\cdot3}=\\frac{1890}{27720}$. If the numerator and denominator are both divided by $9\\cdot7$, we have $\\frac{(2+8+(4\\cdot5))}{4\\cdot11\\cdot10}=\\frac{30}{440}$. Simplifying the numerator yields $\\frac{30}{10\\cdot4\\cdot11}$, and dividing both numerator and denominator by $10$ results in $\\frac{3}{44}$. This fraction cannot be simplified any further, so $m=3$ and $n=44$. Therefore, $m+n=3+44=\\boxed{47}$."
