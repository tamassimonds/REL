  "problem": "How many distinct ordered pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ are there so that the sum of the reciprocals of $m$ and $n$ is $\\frac14$?",
  "solution": "## **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, the question asks for the number of distinct ordered pairs \\((m, n)\\) of positive integers such that the sum of their reciprocals equals \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).  \n\n- **Initial Reflection:** This reminds me of problems involving reciprocal equations and integer solutions. Ordered pairs mean \\((m, n)\\) is distinct from \\((n, m)\\), so I need to consider both directions.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n- **Setting Up an Equation:** Translating the problem into a mathematical equation could be a good start.\n- **Factoring or Common Denominators:** Utilizing algebraic techniques might help simplify the equation.\n- **Exploring Different Values:** Testing specific integer pairs to observe patterns.\n\nHonestly, I'm not entirely sure which method will work best, so I'll begin by exploring the most straightforward approach: setting up the equation.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nLet's translate the problem into an equation. The sum of the reciprocals of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\):  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]  \n\n- **Reflection:** This looks like a standard reciprocal equation. To find integer solutions, I might need to manipulate it algebraically.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies:**\n\n- **Common Denominator:** Combining the fractions could simplify the equation.\n- **Cross Multiplication:** Clearing the fractions might make it easier to handle.\n- **Assigning Specific Values:** Trying out specific integers to see which pairs fit.\n\nI think starting with the **common denominator** approach is a good idea to simplify the equation.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Applying the Common Denominator**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nLet's attempt to combine the fractions by finding a common denominator:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{n + m}{mn} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]  \n\n- **Reflection:** This setup allows me to eliminate the fractions through cross multiplication.\n\n### **Proceeding with Cross Multiplication:**\n\nCross-multiplying both sides gives:  \n\n\\[\n4(n + m) = mn\n\\]  \n\nRearranging the equation:  \n\n\\[\nmn - 4m - 4n = 0\n\\]  \n\n- **Reflection:** Now, I have a quadratic equation in terms of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). This seems like a step in the right direction since factoring could help find integer solutions.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Rearranging the Equation for Factoring**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nTo make factoring easier, let's try rearranging the equation by adding 16 to both sides:  \n\n\\[\nmn - 4m - 4n + 16 = 16\n\\]  \n\n- **Reflection:** Adding 16 seems unconventional, but it's a strategic move to facilitate factoring.\n\n### **Rewriting the Left Side:**\n\nObserve that:  \n\n\\[\n(m - 4)(n - 4) = mn - 4m - 4n + 16\n\\]  \n\nSo, the equation becomes:  \n\n\\[\n(m - 4)(n - 4) = 16\n\\]  \n\n- **Reflection:** This transformation is perfect! Now, the problem reduces to finding integer pairs \\((m - 4)\\) and \\((n - 4)\\) whose product is 16. It makes the problem much more manageable.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Identifying Factor Pairs of 16**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nNow, let's list all the positive integer pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(a \\times b = 16\\), since \\(m - 4 = a\\) and \\(n - 4 = b\\).  \n\n- **Reflection:** Only positive factors are needed because \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are positive integers.\n\n### **Listing Positive Factor Pairs:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(a, b) = & (1, 16), \\\\\n& (2, 8), \\\\\n& (4, 4), \\\\\n& (8, 2), \\\\\n& (16, 1) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]  \n\n- **Reflection:** Since ordered pairs are distinct, \\((a, b)\\) and \\((b, a)\\) are different, except when \\(a = b\\). This gives us a total of five distinct ordered pairs.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 6: Translating Factor Pairs Back to \\((m, n)\\)**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nFor each factor pair \\((a, b)\\), compute \\((m, n)\\) by adding 4 back to each:  \n\n\\[\nm = a + 4,\\quad n = b + 4\n\\]  \n\n### **Calculating \\((m, n)\\) Pairs:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(1, 16) & \\rightarrow (1 + 4, 16 + 4) = (5, 20), \\\\\n(2, 8) & \\rightarrow (2 + 4, 8 + 4) = (6, 12), \\\\\n(4, 4) & \\rightarrow (4 + 4, 4 + 4) = (8, 8), \\\\\n(8, 2) & \\rightarrow (8 + 4, 2 + 4) = (12, 6), \\\\\n(16, 1) & \\rightarrow (16 + 4, 1 + 4) = (20, 5) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]  \n\n- **Reflection:** I've successfully converted all factor pairs back into ordered pairs of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). There are five distinct solutions.\n\n### **Listing Ordered Pairs:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(m, n) = & (5, 20), \\\\\n& (6, 12), \\\\\n& (8, 8), \\\\\n& (12, 6), \\\\\n& (20, 5) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]  \n\n- **Reflection:** Each pair represents a unique solution where the sum of the reciprocals equals \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). However, it's important to **verify** these solutions to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 7: Verifying Each Ordered Pair**\n\n### **Thought Process:**\n\nTo confirm correctness, plug each ordered pair back into the original equation to ensure that the sum of their reciprocals equals \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).  \n\n- **Reflection:** Verification is crucial to catch any potential errors in the earlier steps.\n\n### **Calculations:**\n\n1. **For \\((5, 20)\\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{4}{20} + \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]  \n   \u2714\ufe0f Correct\n\n2. **For \\((6, 12)\\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{2}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]  \n   \u2714\ufe0f Correct\n\n3. **For \\((8, 8)\\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]  \n   \u2714\ufe0f Correct\n\n4. **For \\((12, 6)\\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]  \n   \u2714\ufe0f Correct\n\n5. **For \\((20, 5)\\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{4}{20} = \\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]  \n   \u2714\ufe0f Correct\n\n- **Reflection:** All pairs satisfy the original equation, confirming that the approach and calculations are correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 8: Conclusion**\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nAfter systematically setting up the equation, simplifying it through factoring, identifying relevant factor pairs, and verifying each solution, I've determined that there are **five distinct ordered pairs** of positive integers \\((m, n)\\) such that the sum of their reciprocals is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).  \n\n<ANSWER>\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(m, n) = & (5, 20), \\\\\n& (6, 12), \\\\\n& (8, 8), \\\\\n& (12, 6), \\\\\n& (20, 5) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n## **Recap of the Solution**\n\n### **Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Initial Brainstorming:**  \n   - Recognized the problem involves reciprocal sums and ordered pairs.\n   - Considered various strategies, ultimately deciding to set up an equation.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equation:**  \n   - Translated the problem into \\(\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{n} = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n3. **Applying Common Denominator and Cross Multiplication:**  \n   - Combined fractions to form \\(\\frac{n + m}{mn} = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n   - Cross-multiplied to eliminate fractions, leading to \\(4(n + m) = mn\\).\n\n4. **Rearranging the Equation for Factoring:**  \n   - Rearranged the equation to \\(mn - 4m - 4n = 0\\).\n   - Added 16 to both sides to facilitate factoring: \\(mn - 4m - 4n + 16 = 16\\).\n\n5. **Factoring the Equation:**  \n   - Recognized that \\((m - 4)(n - 4) = 16\\), simplifying the problem to finding factor pairs of 16.\n\n6. **Identifying Factor Pairs of 16:**  \n   - Listed all positive integer pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\(a \\times b = 16\\).\n\n7. **Translating Factor Pairs Back to \\((m, n)\\):**  \n   - Converted each factor pair to \\((m, n)\\) by adding 4 to both components.\n\n8. **Verifying Each Ordered Pair:**  \n   - Plugged each ordered pair back into the original equation to ensure validity.\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\nBy carefully following each step and verifying the solutions, the correct number of distinct ordered pairs is determined.

  "ground_truth": "As an equation, $\\frac 1m + \\frac 1n = \\frac 14$. Multiplying both sides by $4mn$ to clear out the denominators gives $4n + 4m = mn$. Re-arranging and applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, it follows that  $$mn - 4m - 4n + 16 = (m-4)(n-4) = 16.$$Thus, $m-4$ and $n-4$ are pairs of factors of $16$; to satisfy the positive condition, both factors must also be positive. Then, $$(m-4,n-4) = (1,16),(2,8),(4,4),(8,2),(16,1),$$yielding $\\boxed{5}$ distinct ordered pairs."
