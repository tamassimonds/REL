  "solution": "Certainly! Let's craft a polished, coherent solution that mirrors a genuine human thought process while maintaining a conversational tone. We'll integrate brainstorming, reflections, and step-by-step reasoning to ensure clarity and correctness. Remember, the final answer remains unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, let's see what we have here. The function \\( f(x) \\) satisfies two conditions:\n\n1. \\( f(1) = 1 \\)\n2. \\( f(x + y) = 3^y f(x) + 2^x f(y) \\) for all real numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nHmm, this looks like a functional equation. I remember dealing with similar problems before where I had to find a general form for \\( f(x) \\). The presence of \\( 3^y \\) and \\( 2^x \\) suggests that exponential functions might be involved. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure yet. Let's brainstorm some strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Assume a Specific Form:**  \n   Maybe assume \\( f(x) \\) is an exponential function or a polynomial and see if it fits.\n\n2. **Plug in Specific Values:**  \n   Try plugging in specific values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to generate equations that might reveal \\( f(x) \\).\n\n3. **Use Symmetry:**  \n   Look for patterns or symmetries in the functional equation that could simplify things.\n\n4. **Suppose Linear Combination:**  \n   Perhaps \\( f(x) \\) is a combination of exponential functions.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nStarting with assuming a specific form often helps, but it can be hit or miss. Plugging in specific values is usually a good way to get insights, so maybe I'll start there.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Plugging in Specific Values**\n\nLet's try setting \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\) since those are often easy to compute.\n\n**Case 1:** Let \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nf(0 + 0) = 3^0 f(0) + 2^0 f(0) \\Rightarrow f(0) = 1 \\cdot f(0) + 1 \\cdot f(0) = 2f(0)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow f(0) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, but if \\( f(0) = 0 \\), does that align with \\( f(1) = 1 \\)? It doesn't immediately raise any contradictions, so this might be correct. Let's proceed.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nOkay, that was straightforward. Now, let's try plugging in other simple values to see what else we can uncover.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Plugging in \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\)**\n\nGiven \\( f(1) = 1 \\), let's see what happens when \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\nf(1 + 1) = 3^1 f(1) + 2^1 f(1) \\Rightarrow f(2) = 3 \\times 1 + 2 \\times 1 = 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow f(2) = 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAlright, so now we have \\( f(2) = 5 \\). This is starting to build a pattern. Maybe \\( f(x) \\) is some linear or exponential function. \n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWith \\( f(0) = 0 \\), \\( f(1) = 1 \\), and \\( f(2) = 5 \\), I'm inclined to think that \\( f(x) \\) might be linear, but the jump from \\( f(1) \\) to \\( f(2) \\) suggests it could be more complex. Let's continue exploring.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring \\( f(3) \\)**\n\nLet's find \\( f(3) \\) by setting \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\nf(2 + 1) = 3^1 f(2) + 2^2 f(1) \\Rightarrow f(3) = 3 \\times 5 + 4 \\times 1 = 15 + 4 = 19\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow f(3) = 19\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nInteresting, so \\( f(3) = 19 \\). The values are increasing rapidly, which suggests an exponential component. Maybe \\( f(x) \\) involves powers of 2 and 3.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nGiven that \\( f(2) = 5 \\) and \\( f(3) = 19 \\), this doesn't seem to align with a simple linear or quadratic function. Perhaps \\( f(x) \\) is a combination of exponential functions. Let's explore that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Assuming an Exponential Form**\n\nSuppose \\( f(x) = a \\cdot 3^x + b \\cdot 2^x \\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis assumption incorporates the \\( 3^y \\) and \\( 2^x \\) terms from the functional equation, which seems promising.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf this form works, we can determine \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) using the given conditions. Let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Applying the Initial Condition \\( f(1) = 1 \\)**\n\nPlug \\( x = 1 \\) into our assumed form:\n\n\\[\nf(1) = a \\cdot 3^1 + b \\cdot 2^1 = 3a + 2b = 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow 3a + 2b = 1 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, we have our first equation. We'll need another equation to solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWe can generate a second equation by using another known value, such as \\( f(0) = 0 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Applying \\( f(0) = 0 \\)**\n\nPlug \\( x = 0 \\) into our assumed form:\n\n\\[\nf(0) = a \\cdot 3^0 + b \\cdot 2^0 = a + b = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow a + b = 0 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n3a + 2b &= 1 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\\\\\na + b &= 0 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWe can solve this system to find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Solving the System of Equations**\n\nFrom Equation 2:\n\n\\[\na + b = 0 \\Rightarrow a = -b\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( a = -b \\) into Equation 1:\n\n\\[\n3(-b) + 2b = 1 \\Rightarrow -3b + 2b = 1 \\Rightarrow -b = 1 \\Rightarrow b = -1\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( a = -b = 1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, we have \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = -1 \\). Let's plug these back into our assumed form to see if it makes sense.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWith \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = -1 \\), our assumed function becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = 3^x - 2^x\n\\]\n\nLet's verify if this satisfies the original functional equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Verifying the Solution**\n\nWe need to check if \\( f(x) = 3^x - 2^x \\) satisfies:\n\n\\[\nf(x + y) = 3^y f(x) + 2^x f(y)\n\\]\n\n**Let's compute both sides:**\n\n1. **Left Side (LS):**\n\n\\[\nf(x + y) = 3^{x+y} - 2^{x+y}\n\\]\n\n2. **Right Side (RS):**\n\n\\[\n3^y f(x) + 2^x f(y) = 3^y (3^x - 2^x) + 2^x (3^y - 2^y)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 3^{x+y} - 3^y 2^x + 2^x 3^y - 2^{x+y}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying RS:**\n\n\\[\n= 3^{x+y} + (2^x 3^y - 3^y 2^x) - 2^{x+y}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 3^{x+y} - 2^{x+y}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= f(x + y)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth sides match perfectly! This confirms that our assumed form is correct.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nGreat, our assumption worked. Now, let's summarize our findings.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>  \n\\[\nf(x) = 3^x - 2^x  \n\\]\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically brainstorming and testing different approaches, we arrived at the correct solution. Initially, plugging in specific values helped us identify patterns, and assuming an exponential form led us to the exact function. Throughout the process, verifying each step ensured that our solution was consistent with the given functional equation.\n\n---\n\nThere you have it! A complete, coherent solution that walks through the thought process step by step, leading us to the final answer without altering it.",
  "ground_truth": "Switching the roles of $x$ and $y,$ we get\n\\[f(y + x) = 3^x f(y) + 2^y f(x).\\]Hence,\n\\[3^y f(x) + 2^x f(y) = 3^x f(y) + 2^y f(x).\\]Then\n\\[(3^y - 2^y) f(x) = (3^x - 2^x) f(y),\\]so for $x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0,$\n\\[\\frac{f(x)}{3^x - 2^x} = \\frac{f(y)}{3^y - 2^y}.\\]Setting $y = 1,$ we get\n\\[\\frac{f(x)}{3^x - 2^x} = \\frac{f(1)}{3^1 - 2^1} = 1,\\]so $f(x) = \\boxed{3^x - 2^x}.$  Note that this formula also holds for $x = 0.$"
