  "solution": "To find the perimeter of the region bounded by semicircular arcs on the sides of a square with a side length of \\( \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Radius of the Semicircles\nEach side of the square serves as the diameter for a semicircle. The radius \\( r \\) of each semicircle is calculated as:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{diameter} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{\\pi} = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Length of One Semicircle\nThe circumference \\( C \\) of a full circle with radius \\( r \\) is given by:\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\nSince we need the length of a semicircle, we take half of this circumference:\n\\[\n\\text{Semicircle Length} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times C = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2\\pi r = \\pi r = \\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\right) = 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Total Length Contributed by All Semicircles\nThere are four semicircles, one for each side of the square. Therefore, the total contribution to the perimeter from all semicircles is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Length} = 4 \\times \\text{Semicircle Length} = 4 \\times 1 = 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nNo additional segments contribute to the perimeter; the entire perimeter comprises just the lengths of the semicircles. Therefore, the total perimeter of the region bounded by the semicircular arcs is:\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 4\n\\]\n\nIn summary, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 4\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Since the square has side length $2/\\pi$,  the diameter of each circular section is $2/\\pi$. The boundary of the region consists of  4 semicircles, whose total perimeter is twice the circumference of a  circle having  diameter $2/\\pi$. Hence the perimeter of the region is \\[\n2\\cdot \\left(\\pi\\cdot \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right) = \\boxed{4}.\n\\]"
