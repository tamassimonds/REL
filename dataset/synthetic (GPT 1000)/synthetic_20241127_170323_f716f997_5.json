  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, capturing my thought process along the way. \n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let\u2019s dive into this. The problem asks us to compute:\n\n\\[ \n2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56} \n\\]\n\nand express the answer as an integer between 0 and 55.\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \nOkay, I see we\u2019re dealing with modular inverses and modular arithmetic. This reminds me of problems I've encountered before, but it's been a while. I need to recall how to find modular inverses and correctly apply modular operations.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**  \n1. **Compute Inverses First:** Find the modular inverses of 5 and 11 modulo 56, then plug them into the expression.\n2. **Simplify Using Properties:** Use properties of modular arithmetic\u2014like distributivity\u2014to simplify the expression before computing.\n3. **Handle Each Term Separately:** Compute each term individually modulo 56, then add the results.\n\n**Leaning Towards Strategy 1:**  \nFinding the inverses first seems straightforward. I\u2019ll start with that but keep the other strategies in mind in case I run into any issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Computing Modular Inverses**\n\n**1.1 Finding \\(5^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo find the modular inverse of 5 modulo 56, I need a number \\(b\\) such that:\n\n\\[\n5 \\cdot b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}\n\\]\n\nI recall that the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm** is a reliable method to find such inverses. Let\u2019s proceed with that.\n\n**Checking Coprimality:**  \nWait a minute, before applying the algorithm, I should ensure that 5 and 56 are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor, GCD, is 1). If they're not, an inverse won't exist.\n\n- **Calculating GCD:**  \n  \\[\n  56 \\div 5 = 11 \\text{ remainder } 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  5 \\div 1 = 5 \\text{ remainder } 0\n  \\]\n  GCD is 1.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSince the GCD is 1, the inverse exists. Phew, we can proceed!\n\n**Applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**  \nNow, let's find \\(b\\) using back-substitution.\n\n- **Step 1:**  \n  \\[\n  56 = 5 \\times 11 + 1\n  \\]\n- **Step 2:**  \n  \\[\n  5 = 1 \\times 5 + 0\n  \\]\n  \n**Expressing 1 as a Linear Combination:**  \nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\[\n1 = 56 - 5 \\times 11\n\\]\n\nThis can be rearranged as:\n\n\\[\n1 = 56 \\times 1 + (-11) \\times 5\n\\]\n\n**Interpreting the Result:**  \nSo, the modular inverse of 5 modulo 56 is \\(-11\\). But wait, modular inverses are typically expressed as positive integers within the modulus range. Let\u2019s convert \\(-11\\) to a positive equivalent.\n\n**Converting to Positive:**  \n\\[\n-11 + 56 = 45\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**  \nLet me double-check to ensure this is correct.\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 45 = 225\n\\]\n\\[\n225 \\mod 56 = 225 - (56 \\times 4) = 225 - 224 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIt satisfies the condition \\(5 \\cdot 45 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}\\). So, \\(5^{-1} = 45\\) is correct.\n\n**<CHECK>**  \nCorrect\u2014\\(5^{-1} \\equiv 45 \\pmod{56}\\).\n\n---\n\n**1.2 Finding \\(11^{-1} \\pmod{56}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSimilarly, I need to find \\(b\\) such that:\n\n\\[\n11 \\cdot b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}\n\\]\n\nAgain, I\u2019ll use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n\n**Checking Coprimality:**  \nLet\u2019s confirm that 11 and 56 are coprime.\n\n- **Calculating GCD:**  \n  \\[\n  56 \\div 11 = 5 \\text{ remainder } 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  11 \\div 1 = 11 \\text{ remainder } 0\n  \\]\n  GCD is 1.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSince the GCD is 1, an inverse exists. Great, let's move on.\n\n**Applying the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:**  \n- **Step 1:**  \n  \\[\n  56 = 11 \\times 5 + 1\n  \\]\n- **Step 2:**  \n  \\[\n  11 = 1 \\times 11 + 0\n  \\]\n  \n**Expressing 1 as a Linear Combination:**  \nFrom the first equation:\n\n\\[\n1 = 56 - 11 \\times 5\n\\]\n\nThis can be rearranged as:\n\n\\[\n1 = 56 \\times 1 + (-5) \\times 11\n\\]\n\n**Interpreting the Result:**  \nThus, the modular inverse of 11 modulo 56 is \\(-5\\). Let\u2019s convert this to a positive equivalent.\n\n**Converting to Positive:**  \n\\[\n-5 + 56 = 51\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**  \nLet\u2019s verify to ensure correctness.\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 51 = 561\n\\]\n\\[\n561 \\mod 56 = 561 - (56 \\times 10) = 561 - 560 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIt satisfies \\(11 \\cdot 51 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{56}\\). Therefore, \\(11^{-1} = 51\\) is correct.\n\n**<CHECK>**  \nCorrect\u2014\\(11^{-1} \\equiv 51 \\pmod{56}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection After Step 1**\n\n**Does Strategy 1 Work?**  \nSo far, so good! I've successfully found the modular inverses:\n\n\\[\n5^{-1} \\equiv 45 \\pmod{56} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 11^{-1} \\equiv 51 \\pmod{56}\n\\]\n\nNow, I can proceed to plug these inverses back into the original expression. But before moving forward, let me double-check the original question to ensure I'm still on the right track.\n\n**Revisiting the Original Expression:**  \n\\[\n2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}\n\\]\n\nWith the inverses, this becomes:\n\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 45 + 8 \\cdot 51 \\pmod{56}\n\\]\n\nEverything aligns so far. Let's move on to the next step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Computing the Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need to evaluate:\n\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 45 + 8 \\cdot 51 \\pmod{56}\n\\]\n\nI\u2019ll compute each term separately, add them, and then apply the modulo operation.\n\n**2.1 Calculating Each Term**\n\n**First Term:**  \n\\[\n2 \\cdot 45 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Second Term:**  \n\\[\n8 \\cdot 51 = 408\n\\]\n\n**Summing the Terms:**  \n\\[\n90 + 408 = 498\n\\]\n\n**<THINK>**  \nHmm, that seems straightforward. But I wonder if reducing each term modulo 56 before adding them would make the calculation easier. Let's explore that as an alternative to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Exploring Alternative Approach:**  \nInstead of adding the large numbers first, I can reduce each term modulo 56 individually and then sum the results. Let\u2019s see if that gives the same answer.\n\n**2.2 Reducing Each Term Modulo 56**\n\n**First Term Reduced:**  \n\\[\n90 \\mod 56 = 90 - 56 = 34\n\\]\n\n**Second Term Reduced:**  \n\\[\n408 \\mod 56 = 408 - (56 \\times 7) = 408 - 392 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Summing the Reduced Terms:**  \n\\[\n34 + 16 = 50\n\\]\n\n**<REFLECTION>**  \nInteresting! Reducing each term individually before adding them yields 50, which is much simpler to handle. This also serves as a double-check for my calculations. Both methods lead to the same result, enhancing confidence in the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying Modulo 56 to the Total Sum**\n\n**Original Approach:**  \n\\[\n498 \\mod 56\n\\]\n\n**Calculating:**  \n\\[\n498 \\div 56 \\approx 8.89 \\rightarrow \\text{quotient is } 8\n\\]\n\\[\n498 - (56 \\times 8) = 498 - 448 = 50\n\\]\n\n**<CHECK>**  \nBoth the original and alternative methods agree that:\n\n\\[\n498 \\equiv 50 \\pmod{56}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n<ANSWER> \n50 \nsolution</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Multiple Methods Consistency:**  \nBy calculating both directly and through reducing each term individually, I\u2019ve ensured the accuracy of the solution. Consistency across different approaches confirms that the final answer is correct.\n\n**<THINK>**  \nWait, is there another way to verify this? Perhaps using a calculator or applying modular arithmetic properties differently? However, since both manual methods agree, I feel confident that the solution is accurate. Overcomplicating might not be necessary here.\n\n**<REFLECTION>**  \nInitially, I considered finding the inverses directly, which worked well. Exploring an alternative approach\u2014reducing each term before summing\u2014served as a valuable check and reinforced the correctness of the solution. This multi-step verification ensures that the final answer is robust and reliable.\n\n**<CONCLUSION>**  \nThrough careful application of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and verifying calculations via multiple methods, the final answer is confirmed as:\n\n\\(\n<ANSWER> \n50 \nsolution</ANSWER>\n\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n1. **Understanding the Question:**  \n   - Recognized the need for modular inverses.\n   - Identified potential strategies.\n\n2. **Choosing Strategy:**  \n   - Opted to compute inverses first using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n\n3. **Computing Inverses:**  \n   - Verified coprimality.\n   - Applied the algorithm to find \\(5^{-1}\\) and \\(11^{-1}\\).\n   - Confirmed correctness through multiplication checks.\n\n4. **Calculating the Expression:**  \n   - Evaluated each term.\n   - Considered alternative methods (reducing modulo before summing) to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. **Applying Modulo Operation:**  \n   - Reduced the total sum modulo 56.\n   - Cross-verified using different approaches.\n\n6. **Final Verification:**  \n   - Ensured consistency across methods.\n   - Confirmed the final answer through multiple checks.\n\n7. **<ANSWER>**  \n   \\( \n<ANSWER> \n50 \nsolution</ANSWER>\nsolution\\)\n\n---\n\n**<TAKEAWAY>**  \nBy systematically applying and verifying each step, I ensured the correctness of the solution. Exploring alternative methods not only served as a validation check but also enhanced the overall understanding of modular arithmetic concepts.\n\n**<FEEDBACK>**  \nReflecting on the process, taking the time to verify each step through multiple methods proved invaluable. It reinforced the accuracy of the solution and built confidence in the approach. This practice is essential, especially when dealing with complex mathematical problems, to avoid errors and ensure reliability.",
  "ground_truth": "If we first get a \"common denominator\" as if 2, 5, 8, and 11 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\\frac 25 + \\frac{8}{11} \\equiv \\frac{2 \\cdot 11 + 8 \\cdot 5}{55} \\equiv \\frac{62}{-1} \\equiv -62 \\equiv \\boxed{50} \\pmod{56}.$$Indeed, we can justify this manipulation as follows. Suppose that $n \\equiv 2 \\cdot 5^{-1} + 8 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\pmod{56}$; then multiplying both sides of the congruence by $55$ (which is relatively prime with $56$) yields that $-n \\equiv 55n \\equiv 22 + 40 \\equiv 62 \\pmod{56}$."
