  "problem": "What is the number of degrees in the acute angle formed by the hands of a clock at 6:44?",
  "solution": "To determine the acute angle between the clock hands at 6:44, we will calculate the positions of the hour and minute hands separately.\n\n**Step 1: Position of the Minute Hand**\nThe minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, which means it moves at a rate of 6 degrees per minute:\n\\[\n\\text{Degrees per minute} = \\frac{360 \\text{ degrees}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = 6 \\text{ degrees/minute}\n\\]\nAt 44 minutes, the position of the minute hand is:\n\\[\n\\text{Position of minute hand} = 44 \\text{ minutes} \\times 6 \\text{ degrees/minute} = 264 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Position of the Hour Hand**\nThe hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, or 30 degrees per hour:\n\\[\n\\text{Degrees per hour} = \\frac{360 \\text{ degrees}}{12 \\text{ hours}} = 30 \\text{ degrees/hour}\n\\]\nAt 6 o'clock, the position of the hour hand is:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ hours} \\times 30 \\text{ degrees/hour} = 180 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\nAs time progresses, the hour hand also moves at a rate of 0.5 degrees per minute (30 degrees in 60 minutes):\n\\[\n\\text{Degrees per minute for hour hand} = \\frac{30 \\text{ degrees}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.5 \\text{ degrees/minute}\n\\]\nIn 44 minutes, the additional movement of the hour hand is:\n\\[\n44 \\text{ minutes} \\times 0.5 \\text{ degrees/minute} = 22 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\nThus, the total position of the hour hand at 6:44 is:\n\\[\n180 \\text{ degrees} + 22 \\text{ degrees} = 202 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Angle Between the Hour and Minute Hands**\nThe angle between the hour and minute hands is the absolute difference between their positions:\n\\[\n\\text{Angle} = |202 \\text{ degrees} - 264 \\text{ degrees}| = | -62 \\text{ degrees}| = 62 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine if the Angle is Acute**\nSince 62 degrees is less than 90 degrees, it is indeed an acute angle.\n\nThus, the acute angle formed by the hands of the clock at 6:44 is:\n**62 degrees**.",
  "ground_truth": "[asy]\nunitsize(0.8inch);\nfor (int i=0 ; i<=11 ;++i)\n{\ndraw((rotate(i*30)*(0.8,0)) -- (rotate(i*30)*(1,0)));\nlabel(format(\"%d\",i+1),(rotate(60 - i*30)*(0.68,0)));\n}\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1),linewidth(1.1));\ndraw(rotate(186)*(0.7,0)--(0,0)--(rotate(-22)*(0,-0.5)),linewidth(1.2));\n[/asy]\n\nThere are 12 hours on a clock, so each hour mark is $360^\\circ/12 = 30^\\circ$ from its neighbors.  At 6:44, the minute hand points at minute 44, which is $\\frac45$ of the way from hour 8 to hour 9.  Therefore, the minute hand is $\\frac45\\cdot 30^\\circ = 24^\\circ$ past hour 8.  The hour hand is $\\frac{44}{60} = \\frac{11}{15}$ of the way from hour 6 to hour 7, so it is $\\frac{11}{15}\\cdot 30^\\circ = 22^\\circ$ past hour 6.  This means that the hour hand is $30^\\circ -22^\\circ = 8^\\circ$ from hour 7.  Since hours 7 and 8 are $30^\\circ$ apart, the total angle between the two hands is $8^\\circ + 30^\\circ + 24^\\circ = \\boxed{62^\\circ}$."
