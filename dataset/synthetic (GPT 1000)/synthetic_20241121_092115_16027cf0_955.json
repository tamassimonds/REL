  "problem": "Let $p$ be the largest prime with 2010 digits. What is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $p^2 - k$ is divisible by 12?",
  "solution": "To determine the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( p^2 - k \\) is divisible by \\( 12 \\), we must analyze the conditions for divisibility by \\( 3 \\) and \\( 4 \\).\n\n**Step 1: Divisibility by \\( 3 \\)**\n\nFor any prime \\( p > 3 \\), consider the residues of \\( p \\mod 3 \\):\n\n- If \\( p \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\), then \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\\).\n- If \\( p \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\), then \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3\\).\n\nIn both cases, we find \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\). Thus, for \\( p^2 - k \\equiv 0 \\mod 3\\), \\( k \\) must satisfy \\( k \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Divisibility by \\( 4 \\)**\n\nNext, consider the residues of odd primes \\( p \\mod 4 \\):\n\n- If \\( p \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\), then \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\).\n- If \\( p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\), then \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\).\n\nAgain, we find \\( p^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\). Therefore, for \\( p^2 - k \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\), \\( k \\) must also satisfy \\( k \\equiv 1 \\mod 4\\).\n\n**Step 3: Common Condition for \\( k \\)**\n\nWe have derived the conditions:\n- \\( k \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\)\n- \\( k \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\)\n\nSince \\( 3 \\) and \\( 4 \\) are coprime, we can combine these congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, leading to:\n\\[ \nk \\equiv 1 \\mod 12 \n\\]\n\nThe smallest positive integer satisfying this condition is \\( k = 1 \\).\n\nThus, the final conclusion is that the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( p^2 - k \\) is divisible by \\( 12 \\) is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let us iterate over larger and larger positive integers for $k$. If $k=1$, then $p^2-k = p^2-1 = (p+1)(p-1)$. Since $p$ is odd, both $p+1$ and $p-1$ are even, so therefore $p^2-1$ is divisible by 4. Also, since $p$ is not divisible by 3, then $p$ must either be one greater or two greater than a multiple of 3, which means that $p-1$ or $p+1$ is divisible by 3, respectively. As a result, $p^2-1$ is divisible by both 3 and 4, so it is divisible by 12. Therefore, we have $\\boxed{k = 1}$."
