  "problem": "There are 3 math clubs in the school district, with 5, 7, and 8 students respectively. Each club has two co-presidents. If I randomly select a club, and then randomly select three members of that club to give a copy of $\\emph{Introduction to} \\allowbreak\\ \\emph{Counting and} \\allowbreak\\ \\emph{Probability}$, what is the probability that two of the people who receive books are co-presidents?",
  "solution": "To determine the probability that exactly 2 of the selected members from a randomly chosen math club are co-presidents, we'll follow a structured approach.\n\n### Step 1: Overview of the Clubs\nWe have three clubs with the following configurations:\n- **Club A**: 5 members (2 co-presidents)\n- **Club B**: 7 members (2 co-presidents)\n- **Club C**: 8 members (2 co-presidents)\n\n### Step 2: Probability of Selecting a Club\nSince there are 3 clubs, the probability of selecting any specific club is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{selecting a club}) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Probability of Selecting 2 Co-presidents\nNext, we will compute the probability of selecting exactly 2 co-presidents from each club.\n\n#### For Club A:\n- Total ways to choose 3 members from 5: \n\\[\n\\binom{5}{3} = 10\n\\]\n- Ways to choose 2 co-presidents and 1 non-co-president:\n\\[\n\\binom{2}{2} \\cdot \\binom{3}{1} = 1 \\cdot 3 = 3\n\\]\n- Probability for Club A:\n\\[\nP(\\text{2 co-presidents in A}) = \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\n#### For Club B:\n- Total ways to choose 3 members from 7:\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{3} = 35\n\\]\n- Ways to choose 2 co-presidents and 1 non-co-president:\n\\[\n\\binom{2}{2} \\cdot \\binom{5}{1} = 1 \\cdot 5 = 5\n\\]\n- Probability for Club B:\n\\[\nP(\\text{2 co-presidents in B}) = \\frac{5}{35} = \\frac{1}{7}\n\\]\n\n#### For Club C:\n- Total ways to choose 3 members from 8:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{3} = 56\n\\]\n- Ways to choose 2 co-presidents and 1 non-co-president:\n\\[\n\\binom{2}{2} \\cdot \\binom{6}{1} = 1 \\cdot 6 = 6\n\\]\n- Probability for Club C:\n\\[\nP(\\text{2 co-presidents in C}) = \\frac{6}{56} = \\frac{3}{28}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Overall Probability Calculation\nTo find the overall probability of selecting exactly 2 co-presidents, we can sum the individual probabilities from each club, weighted by the probability of selecting that club:\n\\[\nP(\\text{2 co-presidents}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{10}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{28}\\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n1. For Club A: \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n2. For Club B:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{1}{21}\n\\]\n3. For Club C:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{28} = \\frac{1}{28}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Finding a Common Denominator\nThe least common multiple of 10, 21, and 28 is 420. Converting each fraction:\n- \\(\\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{42}{420}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{21} = \\frac{20}{420}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{28} = \\frac{15}{420}\\)\n\nAdding the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{42}{420} + \\frac{20}{420} + \\frac{15}{420} = \\frac{77}{420}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplifying the Result\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{77}{420}\\) can be simplified (both are divisible by 7):\n\\[\n\\frac{77 \\div 7}{420 \\div 7} = \\frac{11}{60}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the probability that exactly 2 of the selected members are co-presidents is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{11}{60}}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "There's a $\\dfrac{1}{3}$ chance that I will select each club. Let $n$ be the number of students in that club. There are $\\dbinom{n}{3}$ ways to choose a group of three students at a math club with $n$ members. Only $\\dbinom{n-2}{1}$ of these groups will contain the two co-presidents. Once I have selected that club, the probability that I give books to the co-presidents is $\\dfrac{\\dbinom{n-2}{1}}{\\dbinom{n}{3}}$. Since the clubs have 5, 7, and 8 students, this means that the total probability is $$\\dfrac{1}{3}\\left(\\dfrac{\\dbinom{5-2}{1}}{\\dbinom{5}{3}}+\\dfrac{\\dbinom{7-2}{1}}{\\dbinom{7}{3}}+\\dfrac{\\dbinom{8-2}{1}}{\\dbinom{8}{3}}\\right)$$which after a bit of arithmetic simplifies to $\\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{60}}$."
