  "problem": "A street has 20 houses on each side, for a total of 40 houses. The addresses on the south side of the street form an arithmetic sequence, as do the addresses on the north side of the street. On the south side, the addresses are 4, 10, 16, etc., and on the north side they are 3, 9, 15, etc. A sign painter paints house numbers on a house for $\\$1$ per digit. If he paints the appropriate house number once on each of these 40 houses, how many dollars does he collect?",
  "solution": "To determine how much a sign painter collects for painting house numbers, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Addresses on the South Side\n\nThe addresses on the south side start at 4 and progress in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6. The addresses can be calculated using the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\n\\]\nFor the south side:\n- First term \\(a_1 = 4\\)\n- Common difference \\(d = 6\\)\n\nCalculating the first 20 addresses:\n- 1st: \\(4\\)\n- 2nd: \\(10\\)\n- 3rd: \\(16\\)\n- ...\n- 20th: \\(118\\)\n\nThus, the addresses on the south side are:\n\\[\n4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46, 52, 58, 64, 70, 76, 82, 88, 94, 100, 106, 112, 118\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify Addresses on the North Side\n\nSimilarly, the addresses on the north side start at 3 and also follow an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6:\n- First term \\(b_1 = 3\\)\n\nCalculating the first 20 addresses:\n- 1st: \\(3\\)\n- 2nd: \\(9\\)\n- 3rd: \\(15\\)\n- ...\n- 20th: \\(117\\)\n\nSo, the addresses on the north side are:\n\\[\n3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81, 87, 93, 99, 105, 111, 117\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Count the Digits in All Addresses\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of digits used in addresses for both sides.\n\n#### South Side Addresses:\n- **Addresses:** \\(4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46, 52, 58, 64, 70, 76, 82, 88, 94, 100, 106, 112, 118\\)\n- **Digit Count:**\n  - 1 single-digit (4): \\(1\\) digit\n  - 15 two-digit addresses (10 to 94): \\(15 \\times 2 = 30\\) digits\n  - 4 three-digit addresses (100 to 118): \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) digits\n- **Total for South Side:** \\(1 + 30 + 12 = 43\\) digits\n\n#### North Side Addresses:\n- **Addresses:** \\(3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81, 87, 93, 99, 105, 111, 117\\)\n- **Digit Count:**\n  - 2 single-digit addresses (3, 9): \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) digits\n  - 15 two-digit addresses (15 to 99): \\(15 \\times 2 = 30\\) digits\n  - 3 three-digit addresses (105 to 117): \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) digits\n- **Total for North Side:** \\(2 + 30 + 9 = 41\\) digits\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Total Digits and Revenue\n\nCombining the totals from both sides:\n\\[\n\\text{Total digits} = 43 + 41 = 84\n\\]\n\nSince the painter charges \\$1 per digit, the total collected is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total revenue} = 84 \\text{ dollars}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sign painter collects **\\$84** for painting the house numbers.",
  "ground_truth": "Using the formulas for arithmetic sequences, we see that the $20^{\\text{th}}$ number for the north side is $3+6(20-1)=117$ and the $20^{\\text{th}}$ number for the south side is $4+6(20-1)=118$. Also, we see that a north side house number is always 3 more than a multiple of 6, and a south side house number is always 4 more than a multiple of 6. We can then distribute the house numbers for the north and south sides into 3 groups each by the number of digits: \\[\\text{North side:}\\qquad\\{3, 9\\},\\qquad\\{15, \\ldots, 99\\},\\qquad\\{105, 111, 117\\}\\] \\[\\text{South side:}\\qquad\\{4\\},\\qquad\\{10, \\ldots, 94\\},\\qquad\\{100, \\ldots, 118\\}\\] The north side has 2 houses with one digit house numbers, and 3 houses with three digit house numbers, so it must have $20-2-3=15$ houses with two digit house numbers.\n\nThe south side has 1 house with one digit house numbers, and 4 houses with three digits house numbers, so it must have $20-1-4=15$ houses with two digit address. Thus, the total cost is \\[(1\\times2+2\\times15+3\\times3)+(1\\times1+2\\times15+3\\times4) = \\boxed{84}\\] dollars."
