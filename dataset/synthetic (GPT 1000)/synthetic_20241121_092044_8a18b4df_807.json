  "problem": "Suppose the function $f(x)$ is defined on the domain $\\{x_1,x_2,x_3\\}$, so that the graph of $y=f(x)$ consists of just three points. Suppose those three points form a triangle of area $32$.\n\nThe graph of $y = 2f(2x)$ also consists of just three points. What is the area of the triangle formed by those three points?",
  "solution": "To determine the area of the triangle formed by the points on the graph \\( y = 2f(2x) \\), we will analyze the transformations applied to the original points, which form a triangle with an area of 32.\n\n### Original Points\nLet the original points be defined as:\n- \\( A = (x_1, f(x_1)) \\)\n- \\( B = (x_2, f(x_2)) \\)\n- \\( C = (x_3, f(x_3)) \\)\n\nThe area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is given as \\( 32 \\).\n\n### Transformation to New Points\nThe transformation from \\( f(x) \\) to \\( y = 2f(2x) \\) affects the points as follows:\n1. The **x-coordinates** undergo horizontal scaling by a factor of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) (from \\( x \\) to \\( 2x \\)), resulting in new x-coordinates:\n   - \\( A' = \\left( \\frac{x_1}{2}, 2f(x_1) \\right) \\)\n   - \\( B' = \\left( \\frac{x_2}{2}, 2f(x_2) \\right) \\)\n   - \\( C' = \\left( \\frac{x_3}{2}, 2f(x_3) \\right) \\)\n\n2. The **y-coordinates** are vertically scaled by a factor of 2, making the new y-coordinates:\n   - \\( 2f(x_1) \\)\n   - \\( 2f(x_2) \\)\n   - \\( 2f(x_3) \\)\n\n### Effects on Area\nThe transformations affect the area of the triangle as follows:\n- **Vertical Scaling**: The area increases by a factor of 2 due to the y-coordinates being doubled.\n- **Horizontal Scaling**: The area decreases by a factor of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) because the x-coordinates are compressed.\n\n### Combined Effect on Area\nTo find the new area \\( A' \\) of triangle \\( A'B'C' \\), we calculate:\n\\[\nA' = (\\text{Vertical Scaling Factor}) \\times (\\text{Horizontal Scaling Factor}) \\times \\text{Original Area}\n\\]\nSubstituting in the values:\n- Vertical Scaling Factor = \\( 2 \\)\n- Horizontal Scaling Factor = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n- Original Area = \\( 32 \\)\n\nThus,\n\\[\nA' = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 32 = 1 \\times 32 = 32\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe area of the triangle formed by the transformed points \\( \\left( \\frac{x_1}{2}, 2f(x_1) \\right) \\), \\( \\left( \\frac{x_2}{2}, 2f(x_2) \\right) \\), and \\( \\left( \\frac{x_3}{2}, 2f(x_3) \\right) \\) remains:\n\\[\n\\boxed{32}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The original graph consists of the points $(x_1,f(x_1)),$ $(x_2,f(x_2)),$ and $(x_3,f(x_3))$.\n\nThe graph of $y=2f(2x)$ consists of the points $\\left(\\frac{x_1}2,2f(x_1)\\right),$ $\\left(\\frac{x_2}2,2f(x_2)\\right),$ and $\\left(\\frac{x_3}2,2f(x_3)\\right)$. Relative to the original graph, it is stretched vertically by a factor of $2$, but also compressed horizontally by the same factor. The vertical transformation doubles the area of the triangle formed by the three points, but the horizontal transformation halves it again, so the final area is equal to the original $\\boxed{32}$."
