  "solution": "Alright, let's dive in and streamline this solution. I'll walk through my thought process step by step, ensuring clarity and coherence while retaining the original answer.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen tackling this problem, the goal is to transform a parabola through rotation and shifts, then find its zeros to compute \\( a + b \\). It involves coordinate geometry, which hints at applying transformations systematically.\n\nAt first glance, I recognize that rotating a parabola isn't as straightforward as shifting it. It might involve altering the equation's orientation, so I need to be precise about the order of transformations.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Transformation Approach:** Apply each transformation step by step to see how the equation evolves.\n   \n2. **Vertex Form Utilization:** Leverage the initial vertex form to simplify transformations.\n\n3. **Symmetry Considerations:** Utilize the parabola's symmetry, especially post-rotation.\n\nI'm inclined to start with the **Transformation Approach**, applying transformations sequentially. If this becomes cumbersome, I'll consider alternative strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Original Parabola**\n\nGiven Equation:\n\n\\[\ny = (x - 2)^2 + 3\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- This is an upward-opening parabola with its vertex at \\((2, 3)\\).\n- It's in the standard vertex form \\(y = (x - h)^2 + k\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nKnowing the vertex is crucial for applying transformations, especially rotation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the First Transformation - Rotate 180 Degrees About the Vertex**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- Rotating 180 degrees about the vertex flips the parabola upside down, making it open downwards.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Adjust the equation to reflect this rotation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Shift to Vertex:**\n\n\\[\ny - 3 = (x - 2)^2\n\\]\n\n2. **Apply Rotation:**\n\n\\[\n-(y - 3) = (x - 2)^2\n\\]\n\n3. **Simplify:**\n\n\\[\ny = 3 - (x - 2)^2\n\\]\n\n**Intermediate Check:**\n\n- The new equation \\(y = 3 - (x - 2)^2\\) represents a downward-opening parabola with the same vertex \\((2, 3)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis transformation makes sense; the parabola is now inverted as expected.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Second Transformation - Shift 3 Units to the Left**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- Shifting left alters the \\(x\\)-coordinates by adding 3.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Substitute \\(x\\) with \\((x + 3)\\) to achieve the left shift.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[\ny = 3 - (x - 2)^2\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(x\\) with \\((x + 3)\\):\n\n\\[\ny = 3 - ((x + 3) - 2)^2 = 3 - (x + 1)^2\n\\]\n\n**Intermediate Check:**\n\n- The vertex shifts from \\((2, 3)\\) to \\((-1, 3)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe left shift is correctly applied, moving the vertex as expected.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Third Transformation - Shift 2 Units Down**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- Shifting down decreases the \\(y\\)-coordinates by 2.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Subtract 2 from the entire equation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[\ny = 3 - (x + 1)^2\n\\]\n\nSubtract 2:\n\n\\[\ny = 1 - (x + 1)^2\n\\]\n\n**Intermediate Check:**\n\n- The vertex moves to \\((-1, 1)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe downward shift is correctly applied, modifying the vertex accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the Zeros of the Resulting Parabola**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- Set \\(y = 0\\) to find where the parabola intersects the x-axis.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSet \\(y = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n0 = 1 - (x + 1)^2 \\implies (x + 1)^2 = 1\n\\]\n\nTake the square root:\n\n\\[\nx + 1 = \\pm 1\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -2\n\\]\n\n**Intermediate Check:**\n\n- The zeros are \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = -2\\), equidistant from the vertex, which aligns with the parabola's symmetry.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe zeros make sense given the transformations applied.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating \\(a + b\\)**\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\n- From the zeros, \\(a = 0\\) and \\(b = -2\\).\n- Therefore, \\(a + b = 0 + (-2) = -2\\).\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\n\\[\na + b = -2\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- All transformations and calculations align with the expected outcomes.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe approach was valid, and the calculations were accurate, leading to the correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> solution**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Started with applying transformations step by step.\n- **Sequential Transformation Application:** Each transformation was carefully executed with intermediate checks to ensure correctness.\n- **Frequent Reflection:** Regular validation at each step to maintain accuracy.\n- **Final Verification:** Confirmed that the calculated zeros and their sum were correct.\n\nBy meticulously following each step and verifying along the way, the correct solution \\( \\boxed{-2} \\) was reached.",
  "ground_truth": "The graph of the original parabola ($A$) and its final image ($A'$) after rotation and translation is shown below:\n\n[asy]\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(4);\n\nxaxis(-3,4,Ticks(f, 2.0));\n\nyaxis(-3,7,Ticks(f, 2.0));\nreal f(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn (x-2)^2+3;\n\n}\n\ndraw(\"$A$\", graph(f,0,4), linewidth(1));\nreal g(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn -(x+1)^2+1;\n\n}\n\ndraw(\"$A'$\", graph(g,-3,1), linewidth(1));\n[/asy]\n\nRotating the original parabola 180 degrees changes its equation to $y=-(x-2)^2+3$. Shifting this last parabola to the left changes its equation to $y=-(x+1)^2+3$. Shifting it down changes its equation to $y=-(x+1)^2+1$. So the equation of $A'$ is $y=-(x+1)^2+1$. To find the zeros of this parabola, we set $y=0$ to get $0=-(x+1)^2+1$. Expanding the right hand side gives $0=-x^2-2x$. Dividing through by $-1$ and factoring out an $x$ from the right hand side, we get $0=x(x+2)$, so either $x=0$ or $x+2=0$. Thus, $a=0$ and $b=-2$, so $a+b=\\boxed{-2}$."
