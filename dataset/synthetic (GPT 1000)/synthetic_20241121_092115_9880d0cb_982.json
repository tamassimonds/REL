  "problem": "Roger has exactly one of each of the first 22 states' new U.S.  quarters.  The quarters were released in the same order that the  states joined the union.

  "solution": "To determine what fraction of Roger's 22 coins represents the states that joined the union from 1780 to 1789, we will analyze the graph data and convert that information into a fraction.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the number of states that joined the union between 1780 and 1789.**\n\nThe graph shows that the bar for the decade 1780-1789 has a height of 6 on the y-axis. Each unit on the y-axis represents 2 states, so we can calculate the number of states as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of states} = 6 \\text{ spaces} \\times 2 \\text{ states/space} = 12 \\text{ states}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Establish the total number of states.**\n\nRoger's coins represent the first 22 states that joined the union.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the fraction of these states.**\n\nWe now find the fraction of the coins representing the 12 states from 1780 to 1789 out of the total 22 states:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{12 \\text{ (states from 1780 to 1789)}}{22 \\text{ (total states)}} = \\frac{12}{22}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the fraction.**\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{12}{22}\\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 22, which is 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12 \\div 2}{22 \\div 2} = \\frac{6}{11}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe fraction of Roger's 22 coins that represents states that joined the union during the decade from 1780 to 1789 is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{6}{11}}\\).",
  "ground_truth": "12 states joined from 1780 to 1789.  Therefore, of his first 22 quarters, 12 of them are from this time period, making for $\\frac{12}{22} = \\boxed{\\frac{6}{11}}$ of his coins being from this time period."
