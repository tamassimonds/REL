  "problem": "If the least common multiple of two 6-digit integers has 10 digits, then their greatest common divisor has at most how many digits?",
  "solution": "To find the maximum number of digits in the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two 6-digit integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), given that their least common multiple (LCM) has 10 digits, we will utilize the relationship between GCD and LCM.\n\n### Step 1: GCD and LCM Relationship\n\nThe fundamental relationship is expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{GCD}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) = a \\times b\n\\]\n\nLet:\n- \\( d = \\text{GCD}(a, b) \\)\n- \\( m = \\text{LCM}(a, b) \\)\n\nFrom this, we can derive:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{a \\times b}{m}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Range of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)\n\nSince \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are both 6-digit numbers, their values range from \\( 100000 \\) to \\( 999999 \\).\n\n#### Calculating the Range of \\( a \\times b \\)\n\n- **Minimum Product**:\n\\[\n\\text{Minimum } a \\times b = 100000 \\times 100000 = 10^{10} \\quad \\text{(11 digits)}\n\\]\n\n- **Maximum Product**:\n\\[\n\\text{Maximum } a \\times b = 999999 \\times 999999 \\approx 10^{12} \\quad \\text{(12 digits)}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( a \\times b \\) can have between 10 and 12 digits.\n\n### Step 3: LCM Range\n\nKnowing that the LCM \\( m \\) has 10 digits, it ranges from:\n- Minimum: \\( 10^9 \\) (i.e., \\( 1000000000 \\))\n- Maximum: just below \\( 10^{10} \\) (i.e., \\( 9999999999 \\))\n\n### Step 4: Maximize GCD\n\nSubstituting \\( m \\) back into the equation for \\( d \\):\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{a \\times b}{m}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating Maximum \\( d \\)**:\n\n1. **Using the Maximum Product of \\( a \\times b \\)**:\n   - If \\( a \\times b \\) is at its maximum (approximately \\( 10^{12} \\)):\n   \\[\n   d < \\frac{10^{12}}{10^9} = 10^3\n   \\]\n\n   This indicates \\( d \\) can have at most \\( 3 \\) digits.\n\n2. **Using the Minimum Product of \\( a \\times b \\)**:\n   - If \\( a \\times b \\) is at its minimum (which has 10 digits):\n   \\[\n   d \\geq \\frac{10^{10}}{10^{10}} = 1 \\quad \\text{(at least 1 digit)}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor \\( d \\) can have at most \\( 3 \\) digits, as \\( d < 1000 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe maximum number of digits in the greatest common divisor is \n\n<3> solution</3>",
  "ground_truth": "Call the two integers $a$ and $b$. Recall that the product of two numbers' LCM and GCD is equal to the product of the two numbers themselves: $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot \\gcd(a,b) = ab.$$This can be rearranged to give $$\\gcd(a,b) = \\frac{ab}{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]}.$$In this case, we know that $a<10^6$ and $b<10^6$, so $ab<10^{12}$. We also know that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\ge 10^9$, since the smallest 10-digit number is $10^9$.\n\nTherefore, $$\\gcd(a,b) < \\frac{10^{12}}{10^9} = 10^3,$$so $\\gcd(a,b)$ has at most $\\boxed{3}$ digits.\n\n(We should check that there are actual integers $a$ and $b$ for which $\\gcd(a,b)$ has $3$ digits. There are; for example, we can take $a=500{,}000$ and $b=200{,}100$, in which case the least common multiple is $1{,}000{,}500{,}000$ and the greatest common divisor is $100$.)"
