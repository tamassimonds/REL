  "problem": "Every June 1, an ecologist takes a census of the number of wrens in a state park. She noticed that the number is decreasing by $40\\%$ each year. If this trend continues, in what year will the census show that the number of wrens is less than $10\\%$ of what it was on June 1, 2004?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem just like we would if we were brainstorming it naturally. I'll start by jotting down my initial thoughts, exploring different strategies, checking my work as I go, and making adjustments when necessary. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- **Okay, so the number of wrens decreases by 40% each year.** That feels significant\u2014almost half!\n- **Need to find when the population drops below 10% of its 2004 level.** Hmm, sounds like an exponential decay problem.\n- **But what year exactly will that happen?** This might involve some calculations over multiple years.\n\nI think I need to figure out how the population changes each year and determine the specific year when it falls below that 10% threshold.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nPossible Approaches:\n1. **Calculate Year by Year:** Compute the population each year until it drops below 10%.\n2. **Use an Exponential Decay Formula:** Apply a mathematical formula to find the exact year.\n3. **Graphical Approach:** Visualize the decay and estimate the year.\n\n**First Instinct:**\n- **Calculating year by year might be straightforward,** but it could take a while if the number of years is large.\n- **Using a formula could be more efficient,** but I need to ensure I apply it correctly.\n\nHmm, to start simple, I\u2019ll try calculating year by year. If that becomes too tedious, I'll switch to using a formula.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating Year by Year**\n\nThought Process:\n- **Let's see how the population changes each year by reducing it by 40%.**\n- So each year, the population is 60% of the previous year (since 100% - 40% = 60%).\n\nReflection:\n- **Is this the right approach?** \n  - It seems straightforward, but might be slow.\n  - **Let\u2019s try it and see how it goes.**\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Let\u2019s say the initial population in 2004 is \\( P_0 \\).\n- We need to find the year when the population \\( P_n < 0.1 \\times P_0 \\).\n\nYear-by-Year Calculation:\n- **2004:** \\( P_0 \\)\n- **2005:** \\( P_1 = P_0 \\times 0.6 \\)\n- **2006:** \\( P_2 = P_1 \\times 0.6 = P_0 \\times 0.6^2 \\)\n- **2007:** \\( P_3 = P_0 \\times 0.6^3 \\)\n- **...continue until \\( P_n < 0.1 \\times P_0 \\)**\n\nChecking:\n- **Let me compute a few years to see if this works.**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nP_1 &= P_0 \\times 0.6 \\\\\nP_2 &= P_0 \\times 0.6^2 = P_0 \\times 0.36 \\\\\nP_3 &= P_0 \\times 0.6^3 = P_0 \\times 0.216 \\\\\nP_4 &= P_0 \\times 0.6^4 = P_0 \\times 0.1296 \\\\\nP_5 &= P_0 \\times 0.6^5 = P_0 \\times 0.07776 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n- **Wait a minute, by 2008 (Year 4), it's still above 10%**, but by 2009 (Year 5), it's below 10%.\n- **So, it seems like the year is 2009.**\n\nReflection:\n- **This method works, but it took a few steps.** \n- **Maybe there's a quicker way using a formula.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Using an Exponential Decay Formula**\n\nThought Process:\n- **Instead of calculating each year, can I use a formula to find the exact year?**\n- This reminds me of exponential decay problems in math.\n\nExploring the Formula:\n- **Population each year:** \\( P_n = P_0 \\times (0.6)^n \\)\n- We need to find \\( n \\) such that \\( P_n < 0.1 \\times P_0 \\)\n\nSetting Up the Equation:\n\\[\nP_0 \\times (0.6)^n < 0.1 \\times P_0\n\\]\n\n- **Oh! I can divide both sides by \\( P_0 \\) to simplify:**\n\\[\n(0.6)^n < 0.1\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n- **This looks like I need to solve for \\( n \\) using logarithms.**\n- **Do I remember how to do that?** Let me think...\n\n\\[\nn \\log(0.6) < \\log(0.1)\n\\]\n\n- **Divide both sides by \\(\\log(0.6)\\):**\n\\[\nn > \\frac{\\log(0.1)}{\\log(0.6)}\n\\]\n\nCalculating:\n- **Let me grab a calculator...**\n\\[\n\\log(0.1) \\approx -1, \\quad \\log(0.6) \\approx -0.2218\n\\]\n\\[\nn > \\frac{-1}{-0.2218} \\approx 4.51\n\\]\n\nInterpretation:\n- **Wait, \\( n \\approx 4.51 \\)?** But \\( n \\) needs to be a whole number.\n- **So, I need to round up to the next whole year, which is 5.**\n\nReflection:\n- **This matches my earlier calculation!** \n- **2009 is indeed the year when the population drops below 10%.**\n\nChecking:\n- **Let me double-check the calculations to be sure.**\n- **Yup, everything seems to align.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach with a Graphical Method**\n\nThought Process:\n- **Just to be extra sure, what if I visualize it?**\n- **A quick sketch might help confirm the findings.**\n\nExploring:\n- **Imagine plotting the population each year on a graph.**\n- **The curve should decrease exponentially.**\n\nDrawing (mentally or on paper):\n- **Initial point at 100% in 2004.**\n- **Each subsequent year drops by 40%.**\n- **Looking for the point where the curve crosses the 10% line.**\n\nObservation:\n- **By the 5th year (2009), the curve definitely crosses below 10%.**\n- **The graphical method supports the numerical findings.**\n\nReflection:\n- **This adds confidence to the solution.** \n- **Multiple methods agreeing is a good sign.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\nThought Process:\n- **Wait, let's summarize everything to ensure consistency.**\n- **Calculated year-by-year: 2009.**\n- **Used exponential decay formula: 2009.**\n- **Graphical verification: Confirms 2009.**\n\nChecking:\n- **Does everything align?** Yes.\n- **Any discrepancies?** None.\n\nFinal Reflection:\n- **Alright, I feel confident that 2009 is the correct year.**\n- **Multiple methods agree, and calculations are consistent.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014calculating year by year, using an exponential decay formula, and verifying with a graphical approach\u2014I determined that the population of wrens will drop below 10% of its 2004 level by the year **2009**.",
  "ground_truth": "After one year, there will be $60\\%$ left. After two years, there will be $36\\%$ left. After three years, there will be $21.6\\%$ left.\n\nAs we can see, these are just increasing powers of $60\\%$, the next year will not dip below $10\\%$, because $60\\% > 50\\%$, and $21.6 > 20$.  However, without calculating it exactly, you know that it will be less than $16.6\\%$, and thus, it will take 5 years - meaning that in $\\boxed{2009}$, the total number of wrens will drop below $10\\%$ of what it originally was."
