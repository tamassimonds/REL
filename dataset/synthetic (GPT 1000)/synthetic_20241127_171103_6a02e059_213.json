  "solution": "Certainly! Let's weave the thought process into a smooth, coherent solution while maintaining the final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming: Understanding the Problem**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. The goal is to express \\(4.\\overline{054}\\) as a common fraction in its lowest terms. At first glance, I recognize this as a **repeating decimal problem**, with \"054\" repeating indefinitely after the decimal point.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- **Converting Repeating Decimals to Fractions:** I recall learning about algebraic methods that can handle this.\n- **Alternative Approaches:** Geometric series could work too, but I prefer sticking to algebra for simplicity.\n- **Tools:** Using a calculator is an option, but manual methods ensure a deeper understanding.\n\nHonestly, I'm a bit unsure which method will be the easiest, so I'll explore different strategies to see which fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Using the Algebraic Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- This involves setting the decimal equal to a variable and manipulating equations to eliminate the repeating part.\n- I vaguely remember needing to create two equations to subtract and isolate the repeating section.\n\n**Let's Try It:**\n\n1. **Setting Up the Variable:**\n   - Let\u2019s assign \\(x = 4.\\overline{054}\\).\n\n   \\[\n   x = 4.054054054\\ldots\n   \\]\n\n2. **Creating a Second Equation by Shifting the Decimal:**\n   - Since \"054\" is a three-digit repeat, I'll multiply both sides by \\(10^3 = 1000\\) to shift the decimal three places.\n\n   \\[\n   1000x = 4054.054054\\ldots\n   \\]\n\n3. **Aligning the Equations:**\n   - Now, I'll subtract the original equation from this new one to eliminate the repeating part.\n\n   \\[\n   1000x - x = 4054.054054\\ldots - 4.054054\\ldots\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   999x = 4050\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\(x\\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 999 to isolate \\(x\\).\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4050}{999}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Fraction:**\n   - To ensure the fraction is in its lowest terms, I'll look for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4050 and 999.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Wait a minute, I need to simplify \\(\\frac{4050}{999}\\). Do 4050 and 999 have a common factor? Let me think...\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Using the Geometric Series Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- If the algebraic method seems cumbersome, another approach is to express the repeating decimal as an infinite series and sum it up.\n- Each term represents the repeating sequence multiplied by decreasing powers of 10.\n\n**Considering Alternative Strategies:**\n- But wait, I think the algebraic method is more straightforward for this problem. The geometric series might complicate things unnecessarily.\n\n**Decision:**\n- I'll stick with the algebraic method but ensure I simplify the fraction correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Continuing with the Algebraic Method: Simplifying the Fraction**\n\n**Step 5: Simplifying \\(\\frac{4050}{999}\\)**\n\n1. **Finding the GCD of 4050 and 999:**\n   - I can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n\n   \\[\n   4050 \\mod 999 = 4050 - (4 \\times 999) = 4050 - 3996 = 54\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   999 \\mod 54 = 999 - (18 \\times 54) = 999 - 972 = 27\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   54 \\mod 27 = 54 - (2 \\times 27) = 0\n   \\]\n\n   - So, the GCD is 27.\n\n**Check:**\n- Does this make sense? Yes, because 27 divides both 4050 and 999 evenly.\n\n2. **Dividing the Numerator and Denominator by Their GCD:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4050 \\div 27}{999 \\div 27} = \\frac{150}{37}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Is \\(\\frac{150}{37}\\) in its lowest terms? Yes, because 37 is a prime number and does not divide 150 evenly.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Solution**\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Let's convert \\(\\frac{150}{37}\\) back to a decimal to ensure it matches \\(4.\\overline{054}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{150}{37} \\approx 4.054054054\\ldots\n\\]\n\n- That matches the original repeating decimal, so the fraction is correct.\n\n**Random Insight:**\n- Oh! I just realized that by verifying the decimal conversion, I can be confident that my fraction is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution</ANSWER>**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{150}{37}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and sticking with the algebraic method, I successfully converted \\(4.\\overline{054}\\) into the fraction \\(\\frac{150}{37}\\) in its lowest terms. Regular checks and reflections ensured the correctness of each step, leading to an accurate solution.\n\n---\n\nBy structuring the response this way, it reads naturally while preserving the original thought process and ensuring clarity in each step.",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x = 4.\\overline{054}$.  We then have $1000x = 4054.\\overline{054}$, so $$ 1000x - x = 4054.\\overline{054} - 4.\\overline{054} = 4050 \\ \\ \\Rightarrow \\ \\ x = \\frac{4050}{999} = \\boxed{\\frac{150}{37}}. $$"
