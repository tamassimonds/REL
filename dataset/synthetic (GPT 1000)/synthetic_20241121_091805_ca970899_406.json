  "problem": "What is the range of the function $$G(x) = |x+1|-|x-1|~?$$Express your answer in interval notation.",
  "solution": "To find the range of the function \\( G(x) = |x+1| - |x-1| \\), we need to analyze its behavior across three intervals determined by the critical points where the absolute values change, namely \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Identify intervals\nThe function is divided into three intervals:\n1. \\( x < -1 \\)\n2. \\( -1 \\leq x < 1 \\)\n3. \\( x \\geq 1 \\)\n\n### Step 2: Analyze each interval\n\n**Interval 1: \\( x < -1 \\)**\n- Here, both \\( x + 1 \\) and \\( x - 1 \\) are negative.\n- Thus, we have:\n  \\[\n  G(x) = |x + 1| - |x - 1| = - (x + 1) - (- (x - 1)) = -x - 1 + x - 1 = -2.\n  \\]\n\n**Interval 2: \\( -1 \\leq x < 1 \\)**\n- In this range, \\( x + 1 \\) is non-negative and \\( x - 1 \\) is negative.\n- Therefore, we find:\n  \\[\n  G(x) = |x + 1| - |x - 1| = (x + 1) - (- (x - 1)) = x + 1 + x - 1 = 2x.\n  \\]\n- The minimum value at the boundary, \\( G(-1) = 2(-1) = -2 \\), and the maximum at \\( G(1) = 2(1) = 2 \\). Thus, as \\( x \\) varies from \\(-1\\) to just below \\( 1\\), \\( G(x) \\) will take all values from \\(-2\\) to \\(2\\).\n\n**Interval 3: \\( x \\geq 1 \\)**\n- In this case, both \\( x + 1 \\) and \\( x - 1 \\) are non-negative.\n- We conclude:\n  \\[\n  G(x) = |x + 1| - |x - 1| = (x + 1) - (x - 1) = x + 1 - x + 1 = 2.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Compile results from each interval\nSummarizing the results:\n- For \\( x < -1 \\), \\( G(x) = -2 \\).\n- For \\( -1 \\leq x < 1 \\), \\( G(x) = 2x \\) ranges from \\(-2\\) to \\(2\\).\n- For \\( x \\geq 1 \\), \\( G(x) = 2 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the overall range\nThe function attains:\n- The value \\( -2 \\) at \\( x = -1 \\) and for \\( x < -1 \\).\n- The value \\( 2 \\) at \\( x = 1 \\) and for all \\( x > 1 \\).\n\nCombining all these evaluations, the overall range of the function \\( G(x) \\) is from \\(-2\\) to \\(2\\), inclusive.\n\n### Step 5: Final answer in interval notation\nThus, the range of the function is:\n\\[\n[-2, 2]\n\\]\n\nIn conclusion, the solution is:\n<ANSWER>[-2, 2]</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We have $$G(x) = \\begin{cases}\n-(x+1)+(x-1) &\\text{if }x<-1 \\\\\n(x+1)+(x-1) &\\text{if }-1\\le x<1 \\\\\n(x+1)-(x-1) &\\text{if }x\\ge 1\n\\end{cases}.$$Simplifying, we have $$G(x) = \\begin{cases}\n-2 &\\text{if }x<-1 \\\\\n2x &\\text{if }-1\\le x<1 \\\\\n2 &\\text{if }x\\ge 1\n\\end{cases}.$$Therefore, the range of $G(x)$ is $\\boxed{[-2,2]}.$"
