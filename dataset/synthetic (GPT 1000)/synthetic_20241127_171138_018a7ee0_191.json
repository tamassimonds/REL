  "solution": "## **Step 1: Brainstorming and Understanding the Problem**\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\nAlright, looking at this problem, I see it's about finding the sum of all \\( k \\) values such that the quadratic equation \\( 2x^2 - kx + 8 = 0 \\) has two distinct integer solutions. \n\n- **First Reaction:** This reminds me of problems involving quadratic equations where the discriminant plays a role in determining the nature of the roots. But since it's specifically about **integer solutions**, maybe factoring or using the quadratic formula could help.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Use the Quadratic Formula:** Find conditions for \\( k \\) that lead to integer roots.\n  2. **Factoring the Quadratic:** Express the equation as a product of two linear factors with integer roots.\n  3. **Exploring the Discriminant:** Ensure the discriminant is a perfect square for distinct integer solutions.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** Not entirely sure which method will be most straightforward. I might start with factoring since it directly relates to integer solutions, but if that gets messy, I'll pivot to using the quadratic formula.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Attempting Factoring**\n\n---\n\n### **Thinking Process**\n\nLet's try factoring the quadratic equation first. If \\( 2x^2 - kx + 8 = 0 \\) can be factored into two linear terms with integer coefficients, it might lead us directly to the integer solutions.\n\n### **Setting Up the Factorization**\n\nAssume the equation can be factored as:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - kx + 8 = (2x - a)(x - b)\n\\]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - bx - 2ax + ab = 2x^2 - (b + 2a)x + ab\n\\]\n\nComparing coefficients with the original equation:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n-b - 2a &= -k \\\\\nab &= 8\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\n- **Wait a minute:** This gives us two equations:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  b + 2a &= k \\\\\n  ab &= 8\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n\n- **But we have three variables (\\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(k\\)) and only two equations.** This seems underdetermined. Maybe I need another constraint or a different approach.\n\n- **Realization:** Perhaps I need to express \\( k \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) and then find all integer pairs \\((a, b)\\) that satisfy \\( ab = 8 \\).\n\n### **Proceeding with Factoring**\n\nLet's list all integer pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that \\( ab = 8 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(a, b) &= (1, 8), (2, 4), (4, 2), (8, 1), \\\\\n&(-1, -8), (-2, -4), (-4, -2), (-8, -1)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFor each pair, compute \\( k = b + 2a \\).\n\n### **Calculations**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(1, 8):\\ &k = 8 + 2(1) = 10 \\\\\n(2, 4):\\ &k = 4 + 2(2) = 8 \\\\\n(4, 2):\\ &k = 2 + 2(4) = 10 \\\\\n(8, 1):\\ &k = 1 + 2(8) = 17 \\\\\n(-1, -8):\\ &k = -8 + 2(-1) = -10 \\\\\n(-2, -4):\\ &k = -4 + 2(-2) = -8 \\\\\n(-4, -2):\\ &k = -2 + 2(-4) = -10 \\\\\n(-8, -1):\\ &k = -1 + 2(-8) = -17 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n### **Checking for Distinct Solutions**\n\n- **Hmm, looking at this list, I notice that some \\( k \\) values repeat:**\n  - \\( k = 10 \\) appears twice.\n  - \\( k = -10 \\) also appears twice.\n\n- **Do I need to consider repeated \\( k \\) values only once?** Yes, because we want the sum of all **distinct** \\( k \\) values.\n\n### **Unique \\( k \\) Values**\n\n\\[\nk = 10,\\ 8,\\ 17,\\ -10,\\ -8,\\ -17\n\\]\n\n### **Summing the Unique \\( k \\) Values**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Sum} &= 10 + 8 + 17 + (-10) + (-8) + (-17) \\\\\n&= 10 + 8 + 17 - 10 - 8 - 17 \\\\\n&= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\n- **Wait, really?** The sum is zero? That seems interesting. Let me double-check the calculations to ensure there are no mistakes.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Adding positive and negative \\( k \\) values:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  (10 - 10) + (8 - 8) + (17 - 17) &= 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n\n- **Confidence:** Okay, the sum indeed is zero. But just to be sure, maybe I should verify using a different method, like the quadratic formula, to confirm that these are the correct \\( k \\) values.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 3: Alternative Approach \u2013 Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring a Different Strategy**\n\n- **Hmm, let me think.** While factoring worked, it might be beneficial to use the quadratic formula to ensure that all \\( k \\) values leading to distinct integer solutions are captured.\n\n- **Quadratic Formula Recap:**\n  \n  For \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the solutions are:\n\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n  \\]\n\n- **Applying to Our Equation:**\n\n  \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = -k \\), \\( c = 8 \\)\n\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{k \\pm \\sqrt{k^2 - 64}}{4}\n  \\]\n\n- **Condition for Distinct Integer Solutions:**\n\n  - The discriminant \\( k^2 - 64 \\) must be a **perfect square**.\n  - Let \\( m^2 = k^2 - 64 \\), so \\( k^2 - m^2 = 64 \\).\n\n  \\[\n  (k - m)(k + m) = 64\n  \\]\n\n### **Thought Process**\n\n- **Oh, this looks familiar.** I can set up equations based on factors of 64 to find possible \\( k \\) and \\( m \\) values.\n\n- **Listing Factor Pairs of 64:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  (1, 64),\\ (2, 32),\\ (4, 16),\\ (8, 8),\\ \\\\\n  (-1, -64),\\ (-2, -32),\\ (-4, -16),\\ (-8, -8)\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n\n- **Setting Up Equations:**\n\n  For each pair \\((p, q)\\):\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  k - m &= p \\\\\n  k + m &= q\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n\n- **Solving for \\( k \\):**\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  k &= \\frac{p + q}{2} \\\\\n  m &= \\frac{q - p}{2}\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n\n### **Calculations**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(1, 64):\\ &k = \\frac{1 + 64}{2} = 32.5\\ (\\text{not an integer}) \\\\\n(2, 32):\\ &k = \\frac{2 + 32}{2} = 17 \\\\\n(4, 16):\\ &k = \\frac{4 + 16}{2} = 10 \\\\\n(8, 8):\\ &k = \\frac{8 + 8}{2} = 8 \\\\\n(-1, -64):\\ &k = \\frac{-1 + (-64)}{2} = -32.5\\ (\\text{not an integer}) \\\\\n(-2, -32):\\ &k = \\frac{-2 + (-32)}{2} = -17 \\\\\n(-4, -16):\\ &k = \\frac{-4 + (-16)}{2} = -10 \\\\\n(-8, -8):\\ &k = \\frac{-8 + (-8)}{2} = -8 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection**\n\n- **Wait a second.** The factor pair \\((1, 64)\\) and \\((-1, -64)\\) yield non-integer \\( k \\) values, so they should be discarded.\n\n- **Ah, I see now.** Only the pairs where \\( p + q \\) is even result in integer \\( k \\).\n\n- **Valid \\( k \\) Values:**\n\n  \\[\n  k = 17,\\ 10,\\ 8,\\ -17,\\ -10,\\ -8\n  \\]\n\n### **Summing the Valid \\( k \\) Values**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Sum} &= 17 + 10 + 8 + (-17) + (-10) + (-8) \\\\\n&= 17 + 10 + 8 - 17 - 10 - 8 \\\\\n&= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n- **Check:** \n\n  - **Hmm, interesting.** Both methods (factoring and using the quadratic formula) lead to the same \\( k \\) values and the sum being zero.\n  \n  - **This consistency strengthens the correctness of the solution.**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Verifying the Solutions**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Before concluding, let me verify** that these \\( k \\) values indeed make the quadratic equation have two distinct integer solutions.\n\n### **Checking Each \\( k \\) Value**\n\n1. **\\( k = 17 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   2x^2 - 17x + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   - **Factorization:**\n\n     \\[\n     (2x - 1)(x - 8) = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{2},\\ 8\n     \\]\n\n   - **Wait, only one integer solution.** But the problem asks for two distinct integer solutions. \n\n   - **Oh! This indicates that \\( k = 17 \\) might not fully satisfy the condition.**\n\n2. **\\( k = 10 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   2x^2 - 10x + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   - **Factorization:**\n\n     \\[\n     (2x - 2)(x - 4) = 0 \\implies x = 1,\\ 4\n     \\]\n\n   - **Two distinct integer solutions:** \\( x = 1,\\ 4 \\)\n\n3. **\\( k = 8 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   2x^2 - 8x + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   - **Factorization:**\n\n     \\[\n     (2x - 4)(x - 2) = 0 \\implies x = 2,\\ 2\n     \\]\n\n   - **Wait, that's a repeated root.** So, only one distinct integer solution.\n\n   - **Hmm, this means \\( k = 8 \\) doesn't satisfy the requirement of **two distinct** integer solutions.**\n\n4. **\\( k = -17 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 17x + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   - **Factorization:**\n\n     \\[\n     (2x + 1)(x + 8) = 0 \\implies x = -\\frac{1}{2},\\ -8\n     \\]\n\n   - **Only one integer solution:** \\( x = -8 \\)\n\n5. **\\( k = -10 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 10x + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   - **Factorization:**\n\n     \\[\n     (2x + 2)(x + 4) = 0 \\implies x = -1,\\ -4\n     \\]\n\n   - **Two distinct integer solutions:** \\( x = -1,\\ -4 \\)\n\n6. **\\( k = -8 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   2x^2 + 8x + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   - **Factorization:**\n\n     \\[\n     (2x + 4)(x + 2) = 0 \\implies x = -2,\\ -2\n     \\]\n\n   - **Repeated root:** Only one distinct integer solution.\n\n### **Reflection**\n\n- **Wait, looking at this,** I realize that not all \\( k \\) values from our initial list actually lead to **two distinct** integer solutions.\n\n- **Actually, only \\( k = 10 \\) and \\( k = -10 \\)** satisfy the condition of having two distinct integer solutions.\n\n- **Oh! So, I need to revise the sum to consider only these \\( k \\) values.**\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Revising the Sum**\n\n---\n\n### **Summing the Valid \\( k \\) Values**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nk &= 10,\\ -10 \\\\\n\\text{Sum} &= 10 + (-10) = 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, because \\( k = 10 \\) and \\( k = -10 \\) are symmetric and cancel each other out.\n\n- **Quick Double-Check:** Adding them again:\n\n  \\[\n  10 + (-10) = 0\n  \\]\n\n- **Confidence in the Answer:** After verifying through both factoring and the quadratic formula, and checking each \\( k \\) value's validity, the sum remains zero.\n\n---\n\n## **<ANSWER> The sum of all \\( k \\) values such that the equation \\( 2x^2 - kx + 8 = 0 \\) has two distinct integer solutions is **0**. \\</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Reflecting on the Process:**\n\n  - Initially, factoring seemed straightforward, but it required careful verification to ensure all conditions were met.\n  \n  - Using the quadratic formula provided an alternative method to confirm the \\( k \\) values, adding robustness to the solution.\n\n  - Verifying each \\( k \\) value was crucial to identifying which ones truly satisfied the condition of **two distinct** integer solutions.\n\n- **Lessons Learned:**\n\n  - Always **double-check** initial solutions against the problem's conditions to avoid including invalid cases.\n  \n  - Exploring multiple strategies can **validate** the correctness of the solution and provide insights into the problem's structure.\n\n- **Final Check:** The consistency between different methods and the validation of each \\( k \\) value ensures that the final answer is correct.\n\n---",
  "ground_truth": "We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively. Let the two roots of the equation be $p$ and $q$. Then $p+q=k/2$. However the only other restriction on $p$ and $q$ is that $pq = 4$ and that $p$ and $q$ are distinct integers. For each such possibility $(p,q)$, we also have the possibility $(-p,-q)$ since $(-p)(-q) = pq = 4$. This gives two values of $k$: $k=2(p+q)$ and $k=2(-p-q)$. Since these occur in such pairs, the sum of all possible values of $k$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nAlternatively, one can note that the only way to factor 4 into 2 distinct integer factors is $4\\cdot1$ and $(-4)(-1)$, so that the two possible values of $k$ are $10$ and $-10$, given a sum of $0$."
