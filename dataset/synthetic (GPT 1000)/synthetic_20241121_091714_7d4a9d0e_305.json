  "problem": "A ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$, where $t$ is the time after launch. What is the maximum height of the ball, in feet?",
  "solution": "To determine the maximum height of the ball represented by the height function \\( h(t) = -16t^2 + 80t + 21 \\), we need to find the vertex of the parabola described by this quadratic equation. The coefficients are \\( a = -16 \\), \\( b = 80 \\), and \\( c = 21 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Locate the vertex time\n\nThe vertex of a parabola in the form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) occurs at the time \\( t \\) given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nt = -\\frac{b}{2a}\n\\]\n\nBy substituting the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\nt = -\\frac{80}{2 \\cdot -16} = -\\frac{80}{-32} = \\frac{80}{32} = 2.5\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the maximum height\n\nNext, we substitute \\( t = 2.5 \\) back into the height function to find the maximum height:\n\n\\[\nh(2.5) = -16(2.5)^2 + 80(2.5) + 21\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( (2.5)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n(2.5)^2 = 6.25\n\\]\n\nNow substituting this value into the equation:\n\n\\[\nh(2.5) = -16(6.25) + 80(2.5) + 21\n\\]\n\\[\n= -100 + 200 + 21\n\\]\n\\[\n= 121\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe maximum height of the ball is \\( 121 \\) feet. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>121</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-16t^2+80t+21=-16(t^2-5t)+21\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-5/2)^2=6.25$ inside the parenthesis to get \\begin{align*}\n-16(t^2-5t)+21&=-16(t^2-5t+6.25-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16([t-2.5]^2-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16(t-2.5)^2+121\n\\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2.5)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2.5)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+121=\\boxed{121}$ feet."
