  "problem": "The graph of the quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ has the following properties: (1) The maximum value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is 5, which occurs at $x = 3$. (2) The graph passes through the point $(0,-13)$. If the graph passes through the point $(4,m)$, then what is the value of $m$?",
  "solution": "To find the value of \\( m \\) in the quadratic function \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) based on the given properties, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Vertex Form of the Quadratic:**\n   Since the maximum occurs at \\( x = 3 \\), we express the quadratic in vertex form:\n   \\[\n   y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( a < 0 \\) indicates that the parabola opens downwards.\n\n2. **Expand to Standard Form:**\n   We expand the vertex form to convert it into standard form:\n   \\[\n   y = a(x^2 - 6x + 9) + 5 = ax^2 - 6ax + (9a + 5)\n   \\]\n   This gives us the coefficients:\n   - \\( b = -6a \\)\n   - \\( c = 9a + 5 \\)\n\n3. **Use the Given Point (0, -13):**\n   Since the quadratic passes through the point \\( (0, -13) \\), we set \\( c = -13 \\):\n   \\[\n   9a + 5 = -13\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   9a = -18 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = -2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate \\( b \\) and Confirm \\( c \\):**\n   With \\( a = -2 \\), we calculate \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   b = -6a = -6(-2) = 12\n   \\]\n   For \\( c \\) (confirming \\( c = -13 \\)):\n   \\[\n   c = -13\n   \\]\n\n5. **Formulate the Quadratic Equation:**\n   The quadratic equation is now:\n   \\[\n   y = -2x^2 + 12x - 13\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find \\( m \\) for \\( x = 4 \\):**\n   To find \\( m \\), we substitute \\( x = 4 \\) into the quadratic:\n   \\[\n   y = -2(4^2) + 12(4) - 13 \\\\\n   = -2(16) + 48 - 13 \\\\\n   = -32 + 48 - 13 \\\\\n   = 16 - 13 \\\\\n   = 3\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( m \\) when \\( x = 4 \\) is:\n<ANSWER>3</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since the maximum value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is 5, which occurs at $x = 3$, this tells us that the vertex of the parabola is $(3,5)$.  Hence, the quadratic is of the form $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5$, where $a$ is a negative number.  (We know that $a$ is negative because $y$ has a maximum value.)\n\nWe are also told that the graph passes through the point $(0,-13)$.  Substituting these coordinates into the equation $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5$, we get $-13 = 9a + 5$, so $a = (-5 - 13)/9 = -18/9 = -2$.  Therefore, the equation is $y =- 2(x - 3)^2+5$.\n\nWhen $x = 4$, we have $m = - 2 \\cdot 1^2 + 5 = \\boxed{3}$."
