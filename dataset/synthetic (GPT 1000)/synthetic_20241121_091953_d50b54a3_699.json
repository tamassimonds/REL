  "solution": "To determine the total number of pieces required to construct an eight-row triangle, we will calculate the number of unit rods and connectors step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Number of Unit Rods\n\nEach row \\( n \\) of the triangle contains \\( 3n \\) unit rods. For example:\n- Row 1 has 3 rods.\n- Row 2 has 6 rods.\n- Row 3 has 9 rods.\n- And so forth, up to row \\( n \\).\n\nThe total number of unit rods for an \\( n \\)-row triangle can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total unit rods} = 3 \\times (1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + n) = 3 \\times \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nFor an eight-row triangle (\\( n = 8 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total unit rods} = 3 \\times \\frac{8(8 + 1)}{2} = 3 \\times \\frac{8 \\times 9}{2} = 3 \\times 36 = 108\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Connectors\n\nThe connectors in the triangle form a triangular arrangement and the number of connectors corresponds to the arrangement of the vertices. Each completed triangle of \\( n \\) rows contains \\( n + 1 \\) rows of connectors. Thus, the total number of connectors can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total connectors} = \\frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2}\n\\]\n\nFor an eight-row triangle (\\( n = 8 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total connectors} = \\frac{(8 + 1)(8 + 2)}{2} = \\frac{9 \\times 10}{2} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Total Pieces Calculation\n\nNow that we have both the unit rods and connectors, we can compute the total number of pieces required to construct the triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total pieces} = \\text{Total unit rods} + \\text{Total connectors} = 108 + 45 = 153\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe total number of pieces required to construct an eight-row triangle is **153**.",
  "ground_truth": "We'll start with rods. The first row has 3 rods, the second row has 6 rods, and continuing down, we see that the next rows have 9, 12, 15, and so on rods. So the total number of rods in an eight-row triangle is $$\n3 + 6 + 9 + \\cdots + 24 = 3(1+2+3+\\cdots+8) = 3(36) = 108.\n$$For the connectors, note that in an $n$-row triangle, the connectors form a triangle which has $n+1$ rows. For example, a two-row triangle has three rows of connectors, and $1+2+3 = 6$ connectors. So an eight-row triangle has $1+2+3+\\cdots+9 = 45$ connectors. We have a total of $108+45 = \\boxed{153}$ pieces."
