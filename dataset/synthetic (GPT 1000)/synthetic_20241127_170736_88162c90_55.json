  "solution": "Sure, let's bring everything together into a coherent solution while keeping the original answer intact.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nAt first glance, the problem involves periodicity and transformations of a function's graph:\n\n- **Original Function:** \\( y = f(x) \\)  \n  - Shifting the graph 20 units to the right leaves it unchanged.\n- **Transformed Function:** \\( y = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right) \\)  \n  - Need to find the smallest positive shift \\( a \\) that makes this graph identical to itself.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\n- **Periodicity:** The original graph repeats every 20 units, indicating that \\( f(x) \\) is periodic with a period of 20.\n- **Function Transformation:** The transformation \\( f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right) \\) suggests a horizontal compression by a factor of 5.\n- **Objective:** Determine the smallest shift \\( a \\) for the transformed function to maintain its periodicity.\n\nHonestly, at first, I wasn't entirely sure how to connect these concepts, but I knew exploring different strategies would help.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Understanding the Original Function's Periodicity**\n   - If shifting by 20 units leaves the graph unchanged, \\( f(x) \\) has a period of 20:  \n     \\[ f(x) = f(x + 20) \\text{ for all } x \\]\n\n2. **Analyzing the Transformed Function**\n   - For \\( y = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right) \\), the input \\( x \\) is divided by 5, implying horizontal compression.\n\n3. **Calculating the New Period**\n   - Original period \\( P = 20 \\)\n   - Compression factor = 5\n   - New period \\( P' = 5 \\times P = 100 \\)\n\n4. **Determining the Smallest Shift \\( a \\)**\n   - Since the new period is 100, the smallest \\( a \\) that maintains periodicity is \\( a = 100 \\).\n\n5. **Final Check**\n   - Verify that shifting by 100 units preserves the graph's identity.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nInitially, I considered whether the period would increase or decrease due to the transformation. After calculating, it made sense that the period stretched to 100.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Approach**\n\n#### **Step 1: Understanding the Original Function \\( y = f(x) \\)**\n\n- **Given:** Shifting the graph 20 units to the right leaves it unchanged.\n- **Interpretation:**  \n  \\[ f(x) = f(x + 20) \\text{ for all } x \\]  \n  This confirms that \\( f(x) \\) is periodic with a period of 20.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nKnowing the function repeats every 20 units is crucial for determining how transformations affect its periodicity.\n\n#### **Step 2: Analyzing the Transformed Function \\( y = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right) \\)**\n\n- **Transformation:** The input \\( x \\) is divided by 5.\n- **Interpretation:**  \n  This compresses the graph horizontally by a factor of 5.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- Original period \\( P = 20 \\)\n- New period \\( P' = 5 \\times P = 100 \\)\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIf \\( f(x) \\) repeats every 20 units, then \\( f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right) \\) should repeat every 100 units because increasing \\( x \\) by 100 results in \\( \\frac{x}{5} \\) increasing by 20.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nCompressing the input stretches the period, making the transformed function repeat every 100 units.\n\n#### **Step 3: Determining the Smallest Positive \\( a \\) for the Shift**\n\n- **Objective:** Find the smallest \\( a \\) such that shifting \\( y = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right) \\) by \\( a \\) units leaves the graph unchanged.\n  \n**Thought Process:**  \nSince the new period is 100, shifting by 100 units should make the graph identical to itself.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- Smallest positive \\( a = 100 \\)\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes shifting by 100 units align with the new period? Yes, because \\( y = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right) \\) repeats every 100 units.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything aligns correctly. The transformed function's period is 100, so \\( a = 100 \\) satisfies the condition.\n\n#### **Step 4: Final Verification**\n\n- **Verification:** Ensure that shifting by 100 units does not alter the graph of \\( y = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right) \\).\n  \n**Check:**  \n- Original:  \n  \\[ y = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right) \\]\n- Shifted by 100:  \n  \\[ y = f\\left(\\frac{x + 100}{5}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5} + 20\\right) \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince \\( f(x) \\) is periodic with period 20, adding 20 to the input does not change the function\u2019s value.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ f\\left(\\frac{x}{5} + 20\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right) \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nThis equation holds true because \\( f(x) \\) has a period of 20.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe verification confirms that shifting by 100 units results in an identical graph. The approach is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, calculating the new period, and verifying the results, I conclude that the smallest positive \\( a \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{100}\n\\]\n\nThis ensures that shifting the graph of \\( y = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right) \\) by 100 units to the right yields a graph identical to the original.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n<ANSWER>100</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nBy systematically brainstorming, exploring multiple strategies, and verifying each step, I've ensured that the solution is both logical and accurate.",
  "ground_truth": "The stated property of $f(x)$ can be written as an equation which holds for all $x$: $$f(x-20) = f(x).$$We are looking for the smallest positive $a$ such that the equation $$f\\left(\\frac{x-a}5\\right) = f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$$holds for all $x$. Rewriting this equation as $$f\\left(\\frac x5-\\frac a5\\right) = f\\left(\\frac x5\\right),$$we see that it is implied by the known property of $f(x)$ if $\\frac a5$ is equal to $20$ (or a multiple of $20$), or in other words, if $a$ is equal to $100$ (or a multiple of $100$). So, the smallest positive $a$ for which we know that this property holds is $a=\\boxed{100}$."
