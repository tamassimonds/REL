  "solution": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step by step, reflecting naturally as a human would. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, check my work along the way, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem involves a polynomial \\( F(x) \\) with given conditions:\n\n- \\( F(6) = 15 \\)\n- An equation involving \\( F(3x) \\) and \\( F(x + 3) \\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{F(3x)}{F(x+3)} = 9 - \\frac{48x + 54}{x^2 + 5x + 6}\n  \\]\n  \nAnd we need to find \\( F(12) \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- This looks like a functional equation involving polynomials. I've seen similar problems where substituting specific values simplifies the equation.\n- Maybe I can find the degree of \\( F(x) \\) first?\n- Perhaps factoring the denominator on the right side will help.\n- I might need to express \\( F(x) \\) in terms of known values or find its coefficients.\n\nHonestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Let's explore different strategies and see which one works.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Factoring the Denominator**\n\nWait a minute, the denominator \\( x^2 + 5x + 6 \\) looks factorable. Let's see:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Factoring could help simplify the right side. Maybe I can perform partial fraction decomposition?\n- This might make substituting specific values easier.\n\nLet's proceed with partial fraction decomposition.\n\n#### **Partial Fraction Decomposition**\n\nLet's break down the right side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{48x + 54}{(x + 2)(x + 3)} = \\frac{A}{x + 2} + \\frac{B}{x + 3}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):\n\n\\[\n48x + 54 = A(x + 3) + B(x + 2)\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\n48x + 54 = (A + B)x + (3A + 2B)\n\\]\n\nSetting coefficients equal:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nA + B = 48 \\\\\n3A + 2B = 54\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nSolving the system:\n\n- From \\( A + B = 48 \\), \\( B = 48 - A \\)\n- Substitute into the second equation:\n  \\[\n  3A + 2(48 - A) = 54 \\\\\n  3A + 96 - 2A = 54 \\\\\n  A = 54 - 96 = -42 \\quad (\\text{Oops, that can't be right!})\n  \\]\n  \n**Wait, That Can't Be Right...**\n\nHold on, let me double-check my arithmetic:\n\n\\[\n3A + 96 - 2A = 54 \\implies A = 54 - 96 = -42 \\quad (\\text{Mistake})\n\\]\n\nOh, I see where I went wrong! It should be:\n\n\\[\n3A + 96 - 2A = 54 \\implies A = 54 - 96 = -42 \\quad (\\text{Correct})\n\\]\n\nWait, no, that's correct. So:\n\n\\[\nA = -42, \\quad B = 48 - (-42) = 90\n\\]\n\n**Writing the Partial Fractions:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{48x + 54}{(x + 2)(x + 3)} = \\frac{-42}{x + 2} + \\frac{90}{x + 3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the original equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{F(3x)}{F(x+3)} = 9 - \\left( \\frac{-42}{x + 2} + \\frac{90}{x + 3} \\right) = 9 + \\frac{42}{x + 2} - \\frac{90}{x + 3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This decomposition might be useful for substituting specific values of \\( x \\).\n- But I'm still not sure how to proceed directly to find \\( F(12) \\).\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Substituting Specific Values of \\( x \\)**\n\nMaybe substituting specific values for \\( x \\) will help. Let's try \\( x = 0 \\), \\( x = 1 \\), etc.\n\n**Trying \\( x = 0 \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{F(0)}{F(3)} = 9 - \\frac{54}{6} = 9 - 9 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow F(0) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Interesting, \\( F(0) = 0 \\) suggests that \\( F(x) \\) has \\( x \\) as a factor.\n- This is a good starting point; maybe \\( F(x) = x \\times G(x) \\) for some polynomial \\( G(x) \\).\n\n#### **Strategy 3: Assuming a Polynomial Form**\n\nGiven that \\( F(0) = 0 \\), let's assume:\n\n\\[\nF(x) = x \\cdot G(x)\n\\]\n\nSince we need to find \\( F(12) \\), let's try to determine \\( G(x) \\).\n\n**Substituting Back into the Original Equation:**\n\nBut wait, substituting \\( F(x) = x \\cdot G(x) \\) into both \\( F(3x) \\) and \\( F(x+3) \\) might complicate things. Let's see if there's a better way.\n\n#### **Alternative Approach: Determining the Degree of \\( F(x) \\)**\n\nPerhaps determining the degree of \\( F(x) \\) will help. The equation involves \\( F(3x) \\) and \\( F(x+3) \\), which suggests that \\( F(x) \\) is at least a quadratic.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- If \\( F(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree \\( n \\), then \\( F(3x) \\) and \\( F(x+3) \\) are also polynomials of degree \\( n \\).\n- The right side of the equation is a rational function, so the degrees must match appropriately for both sides to be equal.\n\n#### **Strategy 4: Assuming \\( F(x) \\) is Quadratic**\n\nLet's assume \\( F(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial:\n\n\\[\nF(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( F(6) = 15 \\):\n\n\\[\n36a + 6b + c = 15 \\quad (\\text{Equation 1})\n\\]\n\n**Substituting into the Original Equation:**\n\nHmm, substituting \\( F(3x) \\) and \\( F(x+3) \\) into the equation will create a complex expression. This might not be the most efficient path.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This approach seems messy and time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way.\n- Let's reconsider and try a different strategy.\n\n#### **Strategy 5: Looking for Patterns or Symmetries**\n\nPerhaps there's a pattern or symmetry in the equation that I can exploit. The presence of \\( 3x \\) and \\( x+3 \\) suggests a relationship between inputs scaled and shifted by 3.\n\n**Thinking Out Loud:**\n\n- If I can relate \\( F(3x) \\) and \\( F(x+3) \\) through a common factor, it might simplify the equation.\n- Maybe expressing \\( F(x) \\) in terms of its roots will help.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Still not clear how to proceed. I need to find a more straightforward path.\n\n#### **Strategy 6: Using Known Values to Generate Equations**\n\nLet's use the given \\( F(6) = 15 \\) and substitute \\( x = 1 \\) in the original equation to generate another equation.\n\n**Substituting \\( x = 1 \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{F(3 \\cdot 1)}{F(1 + 3)} = 9 - \\frac{48 \\cdot 1 + 54}{1^2 + 5 \\cdot 1 + 6} = 9 - \\frac{102}{12} = 9 - 8.5 = 0.5\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{F(3)}{F(4)} = 0.5 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad F(3) = 0.5 \\times F(4)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This gives a relationship between \\( F(3) \\) and \\( F(4) \\).\n- But I still need more information to find \\( F(12) \\).\n\n#### **Strategy 7: Finding Another Equation by Substituting \\( x = 2 \\)**\n\nLet's try substituting \\( x = 2 \\) to generate another equation.\n\n**Substituting \\( x = 2 \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{F(6)}{F(5)} = 9 - \\frac{48 \\cdot 2 + 54}{2^2 + 5 \\cdot 2 + 6} = 9 - \\frac{150}{20} = 9 - 7.5 = 1.5\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{15}{F(5)} = 1.5 \\quad \\text{since } F(6) = 15\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow F(5) = \\frac{15}{1.5} = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Now I have \\( F(5) = 10 \\) and a relationship between \\( F(3) \\) and \\( F(4) \\).\n- This is progress! Maybe I can find more values to determine the coefficients of \\( F(x) \\).\n\n#### **Strategy 8: Continuing to Substitute Different Values**\n\nLet's substitute \\( x = 3 \\) next.\n\n**Substituting \\( x = 3 \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{F(9)}{F(6)} = 9 - \\frac{48 \\cdot 3 + 54}{3^2 + 5 \\cdot 3 + 6} = 9 - \\frac{198}{30} = 9 - 6.6 = 2.4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{F(9)}{15} = 2.4 \\quad \\text{since } F(6) = 15\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow F(9) = 2.4 \\times 15 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Now I have \\( F(9) = 36 \\).\n- I\u2019m building up a set of points: \\( F(5) = 10 \\), \\( F(6) = 15 \\), \\( F(9) = 36 \\).\n- This is helpful; perhaps I can find a pattern or fit these points to a polynomial.\n\n#### **Strategy 9: Assuming \\( F(x) \\) is a Quadratic Polynomial**\n\nGiven three points, let's assume \\( F(x) \\) is quadratic:\n\n\\[\nF(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\n\\]\n\n**Using the Known Points:**\n\n1. \\( F(5) = 10 \\):\n   \\[\n   25a + 5b + c = 10 \\quad (\\text{Equation 1})\n   \\]\n   \n2. \\( F(6) = 15 \\):\n   \\[\n   36a + 6b + c = 15 \\quad (\\text{Equation 2})\n   \\]\n   \n3. \\( F(9) = 36 \\):\n   \\[\n   81a + 9b + c = 36 \\quad (\\text{Equation 3})\n   \\]\n\n**Solving the System of Equations:**\n\nLet's subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n\\[\n(36a + 6b + c) - (25a + 5b + c) = 15 - 10 \\\\\n11a + b = 5 \\quad (\\text{Equation 4})\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:\n\n\\[\n(81a + 9b + c) - (36a + 6b + c) = 36 - 15 \\\\\n45a + 3b = 21 \\quad (\\text{Equation 5})\n\\]\n\nSimplify Equation 5 by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\n15a + b = 7 \\quad (\\text{Equation 6})\n\\]\n\n**Solving Equations 4 and 6:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n11a + b = 5 \\quad (\\text{Equation 4}) \\\\\n15a + b = 7 \\quad (\\text{Equation 6})\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nSubtract Equation 4 from Equation 6:\n\n\\[\n(15a + b) - (11a + b) = 7 - 5 \\\\\n4a = 2 \\\\\na = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Finding \\( b \\):**\n\nSubstitute \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\) into Equation 4:\n\n\\[\n11\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + b = 5 \\\\\n5.5 + b = 5 \\\\\nb = 5 - 5.5 = -0.5\n\\]\n\n**Finding \\( c \\):**\n\nSubstitute \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( b = -0.5 \\) into Equation 1:\n\n\\[\n25\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 5(-0.5) + c = 10 \\\\\n12.5 - 2.5 + c = 10 \\\\\nc = 10 - 10 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thus, the quadratic polynomial is:**\n\n\\[\nF(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \\frac{1}{2}x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Wait a minute, let me verify this by plugging back the known points.\n- Check \\( F(5) \\), \\( F(6) \\), and \\( F(9) \\):\n\n\\[\nF(5) = \\frac{1}{2}(25) - \\frac{1}{2}(5) = 12.5 - 2.5 = 10 \\quad (\\text{Correct})\n\\]\n\\[\nF(6) = \\frac{1}{2}(36) - \\frac{1}{2}(6) = 18 - 3 = 15 \\quad (\\text{Correct})\n\\]\n\\[\nF(9) = \\frac{1}{2}(81) - \\frac{1}{2}(9) = 40.5 - 4.5 = 36 \\quad (\\text{Correct})\n\\]\n\n- Everything checks out! The polynomial seems correct.\n\n#### **Strategy 10: Finding \\( F(12) \\)**\n\nNow that we have the polynomial, let's find \\( F(12) \\):\n\n\\[\nF(12) = \\frac{1}{2}(12)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(12) \\\\\n= \\frac{1}{2}(144) - \\frac{1}{2}(12) \\\\\n= 72 - 6 = 66\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This seems straightforward, but let me double-check the calculation:\n  \\[\n  F(12) = 66\n  \\]\n  \n- It aligns with the pattern established by the previous points.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's ensure that the derived polynomial satisfies the original functional equation.\n\n**Substituting \\( F(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \\frac{1}{2}x \\) into the Original Equation:**\n\nLet's pick another value of \\( x \\) to verify. Suppose \\( x = 4 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{F(12)}{F(7)} = 9 - \\frac{48 \\cdot 4 + 54}{4^2 + 5 \\cdot 4 + 6} \\\\\n\\frac{66}{F(7)} = 9 - \\frac{246}{42} = 9 - \\frac{123}{21} = 9 - \\frac{41}{7} = \\frac{22}{7} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow F(7) = \\frac{66 \\times 7}{22} = 21\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\( F(7) \\) Using the Polynomial:**\n\n\\[\nF(7) = \\frac{1}{2}(7)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(7) = \\frac{1}{2}(49) - \\frac{1}{2}(7) = 24.5 - 3.5 = 21\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- The value matches, confirming that the polynomial satisfies the original equation.\n- This consistency suggests that our approach is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring multiple strategies, checking each step, and validating the results, we find that:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{F(12) = 66}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Combining denominators and simplifying,\\[\\frac{F(3x)}{F(x+3)} = \\frac{9(x^2+5x+6)-48x-54}{x^2+5x+6} = \\frac{9x^2 - 3x}{x^2 + 5x + 6}= \\frac{3x(3x-1)}{(x+3)(x+2)}\\]It becomes obvious that $F(x) = ax(x-1)$, for some constant $a$, matches the definition of the polynomial. To prove that $F(x)$ must have this form, note that\\[(x+3)(x+2)F(3x) = 3x(3x-1)F(x+3)\\]\nSince $3x$ and $3x-1$ divides the right side of the equation, $3x$ and $3x-1$ divides the left side of the equation. Thus $3x(3x-1)$ divides $F(3x)$, so $x(x-1)$ divides $F(x)$.\nIt is easy to see that $F(x)$ is a quadratic, thus $F(x)=ax(x-1)$ as desired.\nBy the given, $F(6) = a(6)(5) = 15 \\Longrightarrow a = \\frac 12$. Thus, $F(12) = \\frac{1}{2}(12)(11) = \\boxed{66}$."
