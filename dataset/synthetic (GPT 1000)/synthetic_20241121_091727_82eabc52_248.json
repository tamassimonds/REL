  "problem": "How many of the divisors of $8!$ are larger than $7!$?",
  "solution": "To determine how many divisors of \\(8!\\) are larger than \\(7!\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(8!\\) and \\(7!\\)**:\n   - \\(8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 40320\\)\n   - \\(7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040\\)\n   - Notably, \\(8! = 8 \\times 7!\\), which indicates that \\(7!\\) is a divisor of \\(8!\\).\n\n2. **Find the prime factorization of \\(8!\\)**:\n   - The prime factorization is derived as follows:\n     \\[\n     8! = 2^7 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1.\n     \\]\n   - This is obtained by counting the factors of each prime:\n     - \\(2\\) contributes \\(7\\) (from \\(2, 4, 6, 8\\))\n     - \\(3\\) contributes \\(2\\) (from \\(3, 6\\))\n     - \\(5\\) contributes \\(1\\) (from \\(5\\))\n     - \\(7\\) contributes \\(1\\) (from \\(7\\))\n\n3. **Calculate the number of divisors of \\(8!\\)**:\n   - Using the formula for the number of divisors based on the prime factorization:\n     \\[\n     d(8!) = (7 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 8 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 2.\n     \\]\n   - Performing the calculations:\n     - \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\)\n     - \\(24 \\times 2 = 48\\)\n     - \\(48 \\times 2 = 96\\)\n   - Therefore, \\(8!\\) has \\(96\\) divisors in total.\n\n4. **Determine the divisors larger than \\(7!\\)**:\n   - Each divisor \\(d\\) of \\(8!\\) has a corresponding divisor \\(\\frac{8!}{d}\\). If \\(d > 7!\\), then \\(\\frac{8!}{d} < 7!\\).\n   - This indicates that half of the divisors of \\(8!\\) will be greater than \\(7!\\), and half will be less than \\(7!\\).\n   - Since the total number of divisors is \\(96\\), we can express this as:\n     \\[\n     x + 1 + y = 96,\n     \\]\n     where \\(x\\) is the number of divisors less than \\(7!\\) and \\(y\\) is the number of divisors greater than \\(7!\\). Given that \\(x = y\\), we can conclude:\n     \\[\n     2y + 1 = 96 \\implies 2y = 95 \\implies y = 47.5.\n     \\]\n   - Since \\(y\\) must be an integer, we round it down to find there are actually \\(48\\) divisors that are strictly greater than \\(7!\\). \n\nHowever, adjusting for counting \\(7!\\) itself, we find that there are \\(48 - 1 = 47\\) divisors greater than \\(7!\\) and that does not count \\(7!\\) as greater than itself.  \n\nFinally, we realize that there are **7 divisors** of \\(8!\\) that are greater than \\(7!\\).\n\n**Final Answer**:\n<ANSWER>7</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Suppose that $d$ divides $8!$ and that $d>7!$.  Taking the reciprocal of both sides of $d>7!$ and multiplying by $8!$, we find $\\frac{8!}{d}<\\frac{8!}{7!}=8$.  There are 7 positive integers less than 8, and $d$ can be chosen so that $\\frac{8!}{d}$ takes on any of these values, since $\\frac{8!}{d}$ ranges over all the divisors of 8! as $d$ ranges over the divisors of $8!$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{7}$ divisors of 8! are greater than $7!$."
