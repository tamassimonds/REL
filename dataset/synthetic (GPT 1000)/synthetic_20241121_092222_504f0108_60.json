  "problem": "Bob is trying to decide between two cell phone plans. Plan A has no flat fee, but the user must pay $10$ cents per minute on the phone. Plan B requires a one-time fee of $\\$20$, but only requires a payment of $5$ cents per minute on the phone. What is the minimum whole number of minutes Bob has to use the phone for to make Plan B the cheaper plan?",
  "solution": "To determine the minimum number of minutes Bob must use the phone for Plan B to be cheaper than Plan A, we can establish a mathematical inequality based on the costs of each plan.\n\n1. **Cost Calculation for Plan A**:  \n   Plan A charges \\( 10 \\) cents per minute. Therefore, the cost for using \\( m \\) minutes is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of Plan A} = 10m \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Cost Calculation for Plan B**:  \n   Plan B has a fixed fee of \\( 20 \\) dollars (equivalent to \\( 2000 \\) cents) and charges \\( 5 \\) cents per minute. Hence, the cost for \\( m \\) minutes under Plan B is:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost of Plan B} = 2000 + 5m \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Setting Up the Inequality**:  \n   We want the total cost of Plan B to be less than the cost of Plan A:  \n   \\[\n   2000 + 5m < 10m\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rearranging the Inequality**:  \n   To solve for \\( m \\), we first subtract \\( 5m \\) from both sides:  \n   \\[\n   2000 < 10m - 5m\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:  \n   \\[\n   2000 < 5m\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solving for \\( m \\)**:  \n   Next, we divide both sides by \\( 5 \\):  \n   \\[\n   400 < m\n   \\]\n   This means \\( m \\) must be greater than \\( 400 \\).\n\n6. **Final Interpretation**:  \n   Since \\( m \\) has to be a whole number, the minimum value for \\( m \\) that satisfies the inequality is \\( 401 \\).\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum number of minutes Bob must use the phone for Plan B to be the cheaper option is:  \n<ANSWER>401</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of minutes that Bob anticipates using. Plan A costs $10x$ cents, while Plan B costs $2000 + 5x$ cents. We therefore have the inequality \\begin{align*}\n2000+5x &< 10x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2000 &< 5x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 400 &< x.\n\\end{align*} The smallest integer $x$ such that $400 < x$ is $401$. Therefore, Bob must use at least $\\boxed{401}$ minutes to make Plan B cheaper."
