  "problem": "If the lengths of two sides of a right triangle are 5 and 12 units, what is the least possible length, in units, of the third side? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
  "solution": "To determine the least possible length of the third side of a right triangle with two given sides measuring 5 and 12 units, we will use the Pythagorean theorem, which states:\n\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the two other sides. We will explore the different scenarios for the roles of the sides 5 and 12.\n\n### Case 1: 12 as the Hypotenuse\nFirst, we assume that 12 is the hypotenuse and 5 is one of the legs:\n\n1. Set \\( c = 12 \\) and \\( a = 5 \\).\n2. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n   \\[\n   5^2 + b^2 = 12^2\n   \\]\n3. Calculate the squares:\n   \\[\n   25 + b^2 = 144\n   \\]\n4. Solve for \\( b^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 144 - 25 = 119\n   \\]\n5. Finally, find \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   b = \\sqrt{119}\n   \\]\n\n### Case 2: 5 as the Hypotenuse\nNext, we check if it\u2019s possible for 5 to be the hypotenuse. Since 5 is shorter than 12, this configuration cannot create a valid right triangle. Therefore, this case is invalid.\n\n### Case 3: Both 5 and 12 as Legs\nNow, we will consider the scenario where 5 and 12 are both legs of the triangle, allowing us to find the hypotenuse:\n\n1. Let \\( a = 5 \\) and \\( b = 12 \\):\n   \\[\n   5^2 + 12^2 = c^2\n   \\]\n2. Calculate the sums:\n   \\[\n   25 + 144 = c^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   c^2 = 169\n   \\]\n3. Thus, we find \\( c \\):\n   \\[\n   c = \\sqrt{169} = 13\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nFrom our calculations:\n- When considering 12 as the hypotenuse, the third side length is \\( \\sqrt{119} \\).\n- When both sides are legs, the hypotenuse measures 13.\n\nTherefore, the least possible length of the third side of the right triangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{119}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>\\(\\sqrt{119}\\)</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The third side is either the hypotenuse of the right triangle or one of the legs.  It is shorter in the latter case, because the angle between the sides of length 5 and 12 is smaller.  By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the missing leg is $\\sqrt{12^2-5^2}=\\boxed{\\sqrt{119}}$ units.  (Note: $\\sqrt{119}$ does not simplify since $119 = 7\\cdot 17$)."
