  "solution": "To derive the equation of the parabola based on the given properties, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Analyzing the Properties:**\n   - The parabola passes through the point \\((1, 5)\\).\n   - The \\(y\\)-coordinate of the focus is \\(3\\).\n   - The axis of symmetry is parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis, indicating it opens either to the left or right.\n   - The vertex is located on the \\(y\\)-axis, meaning its \\(x\\)-coordinate is \\(0\\).\n\n2. **Identifying the Vertex and Focus:**\n   Let the vertex be at \\((0, k)\\). For a horizontally opening parabola, the focus is at \\((h + p, k)\\), where \\(p\\) is the distance from the vertex to the focus. Knowing the focus's \\(y\\)-coordinate is \\(3\\), we can express \\(k\\) as:\n   \\[\n   k = 3 \\pm |p|\n   \\]\n   We consider two cases based on the placement of the vertex relative to the focus:\n   - If the vertex \\(k > 3\\), the parabola opens to the left.\n   - If the vertex \\(k < 3\\), it opens to the right.\n\n   For simplicity, we choose \\(k = 3\\) (placing the vertex at the same \\(y\\)-coordinate as the focus). Thus:\n   - The vertex is at \\((0, 3)\\).\n   - The focus is at \\((h + p, 3)\\), which must lie to the left or right of the vertex.\n\n3. **Finding \\(p\\):**\n   We assume the distance \\(p\\) is negative (indicating the parabola opens to the left). Let's set \\(p = -1\\):\n   - The vertex is at \\((0, 3)\\) and the focus is at \\((-1, 3)\\).\n\n4. **Setting up the Equation:**\n   The equation for a horizontally opening parabola is:\n   \\[\n   (y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(h = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), and \\(p = -1\\):\n   \\[\n   (y - 3)^2 = -4(x - 0)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   (y - 3)^2 = -4x\n   \\]\n\n5. **Expanding the Equation:**\n   We expand the left side:\n   \\[\n   y^2 - 6y + 9 - 4x = 0\n   \\]\n   Rearranging to standard form yields:\n   \\[\n   y^2 - 6y - 4x + 9 = 0\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Form:**\n   To meet the requirement of integer coefficients, we rewrite the equation:\n   \\[\n   0x^2 + 0xy + 1y^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0\n   \\]\n   Here, the coefficients are:\n   - \\(a = 0\\)\n   - \\(b = 0\\)\n   - \\(c = 1\\)\n   - \\(d = -4\\)\n   - \\(e = -6\\)\n   - \\(f = 9\\)\n\n7. **Coprimality Check:**\n   Finally, we check that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the coefficients is:\n   \\[\n   \\gcd(|0|, |0|, |1|, |4|, |6|, |9|) = 1\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the equation of the parabola in the desired format is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{y^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Since the axis of symmetry is parallel to the $x$-axis, and the $y$-coordinate of the focus is 3, the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is also 3.  Since the vertex lies on the $y$-axis, it must be at $(0,3).$  Hence, the equation of the parabola is of the form\n\\[x = k(y - 3)^2.\\][asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\nreal upperparab (real x) {\n  return (sqrt(4*x) + 3);\n}\n\nreal lowerparab (real x) {\n  return (-sqrt(4*x) + 3);\n}\n\ndraw(graph(upperparab,0,2));\ndraw(graph(lowerparab,0,2));\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,6));\ndraw((-1,0)--(3,0));\n\ndot(\"$(1,5)$\", (1,5), NW);\ndot(\"$(0,3)$\", (0,3), W);\n[/asy]\n\nSince the graph passes through $(1,5),$ we can plug in $x = 1$ and $y = 5,$ to get $1 = 4k,$ so $k = \\frac{1}{4}.$\n\nHence, the equation of the parabola is $x = \\frac{1}{4} (y - 3)^2,$ which we write as\n\\[\\boxed{y^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0}.\\]"
