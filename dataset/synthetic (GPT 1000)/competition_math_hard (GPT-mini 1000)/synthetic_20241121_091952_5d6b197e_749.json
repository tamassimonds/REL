  "problem": "At Beaumont High School, there are 20 players on the basketball team.  All 20 players are taking at least one of biology or chemistry.  (Biology and chemistry are two different science courses at the school.)  If there are 8 players taking biology and 4 players are taking both sciences, how many players are taking chemistry?",
  "solution": "To determine how many players from the basketball team are taking chemistry, let's analyze the information provided step by step.\n\n### Information Given:\n- Total players on the basketball team: **20**\n- Players taking biology: **8**\n- Players taking both biology and chemistry: **4**\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Understanding the Variables:**\n   - Let \\( B \\) represent the set of players taking biology.\n   - Let \\( C \\) represent the set of players taking chemistry.\n   - The total number of players taking at least one subject (either biology or chemistry) is \\( |B \\cup C| = 20 \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**\n   The formula for the total number of players taking at least one subject is:\n   \\[\n   |B \\cup C| = |B| + |C| - |B \\cap C|\n   \\]\n   Here:\n   - \\( |B| = 8 \\)\n   - \\( |B \\cap C| = 4 \\)\n   - \\( |C| \\) is what we need to find.\n\n3. **Substituting Known Values:**\n   Plugging the known values into the formula gives us:\n   \\[\n   20 = 8 + |C| - 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplifying the Equation:**\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   20 = 4 + |C|\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solving for \\( |C| \\):**\n   To isolate \\( |C| \\), subtract 4 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   |C| = 20 - 4 = 16\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe number of players taking chemistry is **16**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>16 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "8 players are taking biology, so $20 - 8 = 12$ players are not taking biology, which means 12 players are taking chemistry alone.  Since 4 are taking both, there are $12 + 4 = \\boxed{16}$ players taking chemistry."
