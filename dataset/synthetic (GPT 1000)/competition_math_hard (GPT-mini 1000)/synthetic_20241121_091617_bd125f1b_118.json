  "problem": "Forty teams play a tournament in which every team plays every other team exactly once. No ties occur, and each team has a $50 \\%$ chance of winning any game it plays. The probability that no two teams win the same number of games is $\\frac mn,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $\\log_2 n.$\n",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of determining the probability that no two teams win the same number of games in a tournament with 40 teams, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Tournament Structure**: \n   In a round-robin tournament with 40 teams, each team plays every other team once. The total number of games played is given by the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{40}{2} = \\frac{40 \\times 39}{2} = 780.\n   \\]\n   Thus, there are 780 wins distributed among the teams.\n\n2. **Unique Win Counts**: \n   Each team can have a unique number of wins ranging from 0 to 39. Therefore, the possible win counts for the 40 teams are the integers from 0 to 39, all of which must be unique.\n\n3. **Counting Unique Arrangements**: \n   The total number of ways to assign these unique win totals to the teams is the number of permutations of 40 distinct objects, calculated as:\n   \\[\n   40!.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   Each of the 780 games can result in one of two outcomes (one team wins, the other loses). Hence, the total number of possible outcomes across all games is:\n   \\[\n   2^{780}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating Probability**: \n   The probability that no two teams have the same number of wins is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (the unique arrangements) to the total number of outcomes:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{40!}{2^{780}}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplifying the Probability**: \n   We need to express the probability in the form \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) with \\( m = 40! \\) and \\( n = 2^{780} \\). Since \\( 40! \\) contains the prime factor 2, we find the largest power of 2 dividing \\( 40! \\) to simplify the fraction.\n\n7. **Largest Power of 2 in \\( 40! \\)**: \n   Using Legendre's formula, we calculate the largest power of 2 in \\( 40! \\):\n   \\[\n   k = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{2^i} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{8} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{16} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{32} \\right\\rfloor = 20 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 38.\n   \\]\n\n8. **Final Form of the Probability**: \n   We can then rewrite the probability as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40!}{2^{38}} \\text{ and we express this as } \\frac{m = \\frac{40!}{2^{38}}}{n = 2^{780 - 38} = 2^{742}}.\n   \\]\n\n9. **Finding \\( n \\)**: \n   Hence, we find that \\( n = 2^{742} \\). The logarithm base 2 of \\( n \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\log_2 n = 742.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{742}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "There are ${40 \\choose 2} = 780$ total pairings of teams, and thus $2^{780}$ possible outcomes. In order for no two teams to win the same number of games, they must each win a different number of games. Since the minimum and maximum possible number of games won are 0 and 39 respectively, and there are 40 teams in total, each team corresponds uniquely with some $k$, with $0 \\leq k \\leq 39$, where $k$ represents the number of games the team won. With this in mind, we see that there are a total of $40!$ outcomes in which no two teams win the same number of games. Further, note that these are all the valid combinations, as the team with 1 win must beat the team with 0 wins, the team with 2 wins must beat the teams with 1 and 0 wins, and so on; thus, this uniquely defines a combination.\nThe desired probability is thus $\\frac{40!}{2^{780}}$. We wish to simplify this into the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime. The only necessary step is to factor out all the powers of 2 from $40!$; the remaining number is clearly relatively prime to all powers of 2.\nThe number of powers of 2 in $40!$ is $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{2} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{4} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{8} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{16} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{32} \\right \\rfloor = 20 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 38.$\n$780-38 = \\boxed{742}$."
