  "problem": "At the end of a professional bowling tournament, the top 5 bowlers have a playoff. First #5 bowls #4. The loser receives $5$th prize and the winner bowls #3 in another game. The loser of this game receives $4$th prize and the winner bowls #2. The loser of this game receives $3$rd prize and the winner bowls #1. The winner of this game gets 1st prize and the loser gets 2nd prize. In how many orders can bowlers #1 through #5 receive the prizes?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 10\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 16\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 24\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 120\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{none of these}$\n",
  "solution": "To determine the number of possible prize distributions among the 5 bowlers in a knockout tournament, we can break down the process as follows:\n\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament operates in a knockout format with the following match-ups:\n   - **Match 1**: Bowler 5 (B5) vs. Bowler 4 (B4) \u2013 The loser receives the 5th prize.\n   - **Match 2**: Winner of Match 1 vs. Bowler 3 (B3) \u2013 The loser receives the 4th prize.\n   - **Match 3**: Winner of Match 2 vs. Bowler 2 (B2) \u2013 The loser receives the 3rd prize.\n   - **Match 4**: Winner of Match 3 vs. Bowler 1 (B1) \u2013 The loser receives the 2nd prize.\n   - The winner of Match 4 receives the 1st prize.\n\n2. **Match Outcomes**: Each match has two possible outcomes: either the lower seed (the one in the match) wins or the higher seed wins. \n\n3. **Calculating Total Outcomes**: Each of the four matches can independently result in two outcomes:\n   - Match 1: 2 outcomes\n   - Match 2: 2 outcomes\n   - Match 3: 2 outcomes\n   - Match 4: 2 outcomes\n\n   Since the outcomes are independent, the total number of different scenarios can be calculated by multiplying the outcomes of each match together:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Outcomes} = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the total number of different orders in which the bowlers can receive their prizes is 16.\n\nThus, the final answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",
  "ground_truth": "We have $2$ choices for who wins the first game, and that uniquely determines $5^{\\text{th}}$ place. Then there are $2$ choices for a next game and that uniquely determines $4^{\\text{th}}$ place, followed by $2$ choices for the next game that uniquely determines $3^{\\text{rd}}$ place. Finally, there are $2$ choices for the last game, which uniquely determines both $1^{\\text{st}}$ and $2^{\\text{nd}}$ places, since the winner is $1^{\\text{st}}$ and the loser is $2^{\\text{nd}}$. Thus the number of possible orders is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = \\boxed{16}$."
