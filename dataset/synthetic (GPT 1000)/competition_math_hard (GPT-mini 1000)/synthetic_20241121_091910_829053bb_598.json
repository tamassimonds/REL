  "problem": "Ten points are marked on a circle. How many distinct convex polygons of three or more sides can be drawn using some (or all) of the ten points as vertices?\n",
  "solution": "To find the number of distinct convex polygons with three or more sides that can be formed using ten points marked on a circle, we need to calculate the combinations of these points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Summary:\n\n1. **Convex Polygons Requirement:** \n   A convex polygon requires at least three vertices. Therefore, we need to determine how many ways we can choose sets of three or more points from the ten points.\n\n2. **Using Binomial Coefficients:** \n   The number of ways to choose \\( k \\) points from \\( n \\) points is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\). In our case, \\( n = 10 \\), and we will calculate this for \\( k = 3 \\) to \\( k = 10 \\).\n\n3. **Calculating Selections:**\n   We compute the individual binomial coefficients:\n   - \\( \\binom{10}{3} = 120 \\)\n   - \\( \\binom{10}{4} = 210 \\)\n   - \\( \\binom{10}{5} = 252 \\)\n   - \\( \\binom{10}{6} = 210 \\) (same as \\( \\binom{10}{4} \\))\n   - \\( \\binom{10}{7} = 120 \\) (same as \\( \\binom{10}{3} \\))\n   - \\( \\binom{10}{8} = 45 \\)\n   - \\( \\binom{10}{9} = 10 \\)\n   - \\( \\binom{10}{10} = 1 \\)\n\n4. **Sum of Combinations:**\n   To find the total number of ways to select three or more points, we sum the calculated coefficients:\n   \\[\n   120 + 210 + 252 + 210 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1 = 968\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe total number of distinct convex polygons that can be formed using the ten points on the circle is \\(\\boxed{968}\\).",
  "ground_truth": "Any subset of the ten points with three or more members can be made into exactly one such polygon. Thus, we need to count the number of such subsets. There are $2^{10} = 1024$ total subsets of a ten-member set, but of these ${10 \\choose 0} = 1$ have 0 members, ${10 \\choose 1} = 10$ have 1 member and ${10 \\choose 2} = 45$ have 2 members. Thus the answer is $1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 = \\boxed{968}$."
