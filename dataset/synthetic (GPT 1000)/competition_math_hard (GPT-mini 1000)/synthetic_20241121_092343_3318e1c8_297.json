  "problem": "Find the domain of the function $\\frac{x+1}{x^2+6x+8}$.",
  "solution": "To determine the domain of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{x+1}{x^2 + 6x + 8} \\), we need to identify the values of \\( x \\) for which the function is defined. The only restriction arises from the denominator, which should not be equal to zero, as division by zero is undefined.\n\n**Step 1: Set the denominator equal to zero**\n\nWe begin by solving the equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 6x + 8 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression**\n\nTo factor the quadratic, we look for two numbers that multiply to \\( 8 \\) (the constant term) and add up to \\( 6 \\) (the coefficient of \\( x \\)). The numbers \\( 2 \\) and \\( 4 \\) fit this requirement:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 6x + 8 = (x + 2)(x + 4)\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( x \\)**\n\nWe set each factor to zero to find the values that make the denominator zero:\n\n\\[\nx + 2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -2\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 4 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -4\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Exclude these values from the domain**\n\nThe function is undefined at \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = -4 \\). Hence, we must exclude these points from the domain.\n\n**Step 5: Express the domain in interval notation**\n\nThe domain of \\( f(x) \\) is all real numbers except for \\( -2 \\) and \\( -4 \\). In interval notation, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -4) \\cup (-4, -2) \\cup (-2, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n**Final Statement**\n\nThus, the domain of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{x+1}{x^2 + 6x + 8} \\) is:\n\n<ANSWER> \\((- \\infty, -4) \\cup (-4, -2) \\cup (-2, \\infty)\\) </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Because we cannot divide by zero, values of $x$ that make the denominator of the fraction equal to zero must be excluded from the domain. Thus, we must first find all values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2+6x+8=0$. Since this factors as $(x+4)(x+2)=0$, the only two values we need to exclude from the domain are $-4$ and $-2$. This gives us the solution $x\\in\\boxed{(-\\infty,-4)\\cup(-4, -2)\\cup(-2,\\infty)}$."
