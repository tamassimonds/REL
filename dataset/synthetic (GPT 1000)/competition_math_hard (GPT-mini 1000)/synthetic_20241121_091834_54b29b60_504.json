  "problem": "The first term of a geometric sequence is 729, and the 7th term is 64. What is the positive, real value for the 5th term?",
  "solution": "To solve for the 5th term of a geometric sequence where the first term (\\( a_1 \\)) is 729 and the 7th term (\\( a_7 \\)) is 64, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Geometric Sequences**: In a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a common ratio \\( r \\).\n\n2. **Apply the n-th Term Formula**: The formula for the n-th term is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}\n   \\]\n   For the 7th term, we have:\n   \\[\n   a_7 = a_1 \\cdot r^{6}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substituting Known Values**:\n   Plugging in the values for the first and seventh terms, we get:\n   \\[\n   64 = 729 \\cdot r^{6}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for the Common Ratio \\( r \\)**:\n   Rearranging the equation gives:\n   \\[\n   r^{6} = \\frac{64}{729}\n   \\]\n   Recognizing \\( 64 \\) as \\( 2^6 \\) and \\( 729 \\) as \\( 3^6 \\):\n   \\[\n   r^{6} = \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^{6}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, taking the positive root, we find:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding the 5th Term**:\n   To calculate the 5th term (\\( a_5 \\)):\n   \\[\n   a_5 = a_1 \\cdot r^{4}\n   \\]\n   Substituting in the values, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   a_5 = 729 \\cdot r^{4}\n   \\]\n   First, compute \\( r^4 \\):\n   \\[\n   r^{4} = \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^{4} = \\frac{16}{81}\n   \\]\n   Substitute \\( r^4 \\) back into the equation for \\( a_5 \\):\n   \\[\n   a_5 = 729 \\cdot \\frac{16}{81}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculating \\( a_5 \\)**:\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   a_5 = 729 \\div 81 \\cdot 16 = 9 \\cdot 16 = 144\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n<ANSWER>144</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The only positive, real common ratio for this sequence is $\\frac{2}{3}$.  Thus, if $x$ is the 5th term, then $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 x = 64$, so $x = \\boxed{144}.$"
