  "problem": "A book with 53 pages numbered 1 to 53 has its pages renumbered in reverse, from 53 to 1. For how many pages do the new page number and old page number share the same units digit?",
  "solution": "To find how many pages in a book numbered from 1 to 53 share the same units digit after being renumbered in reverse (from 53 to 1), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the original and new page numbers**: \n   - The original page numbers are from 1 to 53.\n   - When renumbered in reverse, the original page number \\( x \\) transforms to \\( 54 - x \\). For example:\n     - Page 1 becomes page 53,\n     - Page 2 becomes page 52,\n     - Page 3 becomes page 51,\n     - and so on until page 53 becomes page 1.\n\n2. **Set the condition**: \n   - We want to find instances where the units digit of the original page number \\( x \\) matches the units digit of the new page number \\( 54 - x \\).\n\n3. **Analyzing the units digits**: \n   - The units digit of a number can be obtained by taking that number modulo 10. Thus, our condition is:\n     \\[\n     x \\mod 10 = (54 - x) \\mod 10.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving the equation**: \n   - Rearranging the equation gives us:\n     \\[\n     x \\mod 10 = 54 \\mod 10 - x \\mod 10,\n     \\]\n     which simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     x \\mod 10 = 4 - x \\mod 10.\n     \\]\n   - This leads us to:\n     \\[\n     2x \\mod 10 = 4.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Finding valid values of \\( x \\)**: \n   - To solve \\( 2x \\mod 10 = 4 \\), we express it as:\n     \\[\n     2x = 4 + 10k, \\text{ where } k \\text{ is an integer}.\n     \\]\n     Thus, we have:\n     \\[\n     x = 2 + 5k.\n     \\]\n   - We need to find valid integer values for \\( k \\) that keep \\( x \\) within the range of 1 to 53:\n     - For \\( k = 0 \\): \\( x = 2 \\)\n     - For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( x = 7 \\)\n     - For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( x = 12 \\)\n     - For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( x = 17 \\)\n     - For \\( k = 4 \\): \\( x = 22 \\)\n     - For \\( k = 5 \\): \\( x = 27 \\)\n     - For \\( k = 6 \\): \\( x = 32 \\)\n     - For \\( k = 7 \\): \\( x = 37 \\)\n     - For \\( k = 8 \\): \\( x = 42 \\)\n     - For \\( k = 9 \\): \\( x = 47 \\)\n     - For \\( k = 10 \\): \\( x = 52 \\)\n\n6. **Count the valid numbers**: \n   - The valid \\( x \\) values are: 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, and 52.\n   - Counting these values, we find that there are **11 pages** where the old and new page numbers share the same units digit.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>11 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Each page is assigned two numbers. We can generalize the numbers assigned to page $x$ to be the pair $x$ and $54-x$ for $1 \\leq x \\leq 53$. That is, if $x = 1$, then we can see that page number one is assigned the numbers $1$ and $54-1 = 53$. It is fairly easy to see that the units digits of $x$ and $54-x$ will only be the same if $x$ has a units digit of $2$ or a units digit of $7$. Thus, we simply must count how many such $x$ there are between $1$ and $54$. Possibilities for $x$ are: 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, and 52. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{11}$ such pages."
