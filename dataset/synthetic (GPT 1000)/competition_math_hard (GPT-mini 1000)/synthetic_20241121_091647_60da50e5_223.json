  "problem": "A right circular cylinder with radius 2 is inscribed in a hemisphere with radius 5 so that its bases are parallel to the base of the hemisphere.  What is the height of this cylinder?",
  "solution": "To determine the height of a right circular cylinder inscribed in a hemisphere with a radius of 5 and a cylinder radius of 2, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Geometry Visualization\nWe have a hemisphere of radius 5, with a cylinder of radius 2 snugly fitting inside it. The circular bases of the cylinder are parallel to the flat base of the hemisphere.\n\n### Coordinate System Setup\nWe'll set the center of the hemisphere at the origin (0, 0, 0) and its flat base in the xy-plane (z = 0). The peak of the hemisphere is located at (0, 0, 5) since the radius is 5.\n\n### Cylinder Height Determination\nLet \\(h\\) represent the height of the cylinder. Its base is at z = 0, while the top is at z = h. We need to find this height where the top of the cylinder intersects the curved surface of the hemisphere.\n\n### Locating the Cylinder's Top\nThe cylinder's radius of 2 means the top edge lies on the circle defined by the equation:\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 = 4\n\\]\nAt the top of the cylinder, the height is z = h.\n\n### Hemisphere Equation Application\nThe equation of the hemisphere, derived from the sphere\u2019s equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2\\) (where \\(r = 5\\)), is:\n\\[\nz = \\sqrt{25 - x^2 - y^2}\n\\]\nFocusing on the upper half only, we substitute \\(x^2 + y^2 = 4\\) into this equation:\n\\[\nz = \\sqrt{25 - 4} = \\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\n### Cylinder Height Relation\nThe height of the cylinder \\(h\\) equals the z-coordinate at which it meets the hemisphere\u2019s surface:\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the height of the inscribed cylinder is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\nIn the required format, the answer is expressed as:\n<ANSWER>\u221a21 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We draw and label a diagram as follows: [asy]\n\nsize(110);\npair O = (0,0); pair A = (.3,.94); pair B = (.3,.075);\ndraw(O--A--B--cycle,heavycyan);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W); label(\"$A$\",A,N); label(\"$B$\",B,S);\nimport solids; import three; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); currentprojection = orthographic(5,0,1.3);\nrevolution c = cylinder((0,0,0), .4, .91);\ndraw(c,black);\n\ndraw(scale(1,.25)*arc((0,0),1,0,180),dashed);\ndraw(scale(1,.25)*arc((0,0),1,180,360));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,180));\n\n[/asy]\n\nLet the center of the hemisphere be $O$, and let $A$ be a point on the circumference of the top circle of the cylinder.  Since the cylinder is inscribed in the hemisphere, $A$ lies on the hemisphere as well, so $OA=5$.  We drop a perpendicular from $A$ to the base of the hemisphere and let it intersect the base of the hemisphere at $B$.  Since the cylinder is right and $AB$ is a height of the cylinder, $\\angle OBA$ is a right angle, and $B$ lies on the circumference of the bottom circle of the cylinder.  Thus, $OB$ is a radius of the cylinder, so $OB=2$. We have that $\\triangle OBA$ is right, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\[AB=\\sqrt{OA^2-OB^2}=\\sqrt{5^2-2^2}=\\sqrt{21}.\\]Thus, the height of the cylinder is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{21}}$."
