  "problem": "The members of a band are arranged in a rectangular formation. When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation. When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of members in the band, denoted as \\( n \\), we analyze the given information about seating arrangements in rows and derive equations.\n\n1. **Setup the equations**:\n   - When arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 unoccupied positions. This can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     n + 2 = 8c\n     \\]\n     where \\( c \\) is the number of columns. Rearranging gives us:\n     \\[\n     n = 8c - 2 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n     \\]\n   \n   - When arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 unoccupied positions:\n     \\[\n     n + 3 = 9d\n     \\]\n     where \\( d \\) represents the number of columns in this arrangement. Thus, we have:\n     \\[\n     n = 9d - 3 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Equate the two equations**:\n   Setting Equation 1 equal to Equation 2 yields:\n   \\[\n   8c - 2 = 9d - 3\n   \\]\n   Rearranging results in:\n   \\[\n   8c - 9d = -1 \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( c \\)**:\n   Rearranging Equation 3 for \\( c \\):\n   \\[\n   8c = 9d - 1 \\implies c = \\frac{9d - 1}{8}\n   \\]\n   For \\( c \\) to be an integer, \\( 9d - 1 \\) must be divisible by 8.\n\n4. **Determine suitable values for \\( d \\)**:\n   We need to find values of \\( d \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   9d - 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 8\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   9d \\equiv 1 \\mod 8 \\implies d \\equiv 1 \\mod 8\n   \\]\n   This means \\( d \\) can take on values like 1, 9, 17, etc.\n\n5. **Substituting values of \\( d \\)**:\n   - For \\( d = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     n = 9(1) - 3 = 6 \\quad (\\text{not in range})\n     \\]\n   - For \\( d = 9 \\):\n     \\[\n     n = 9(9) - 3 = 78 \\quad (\\text{not in range})\n     \\]\n   - For \\( d = 17 \\):\n     \\[\n     n = 9(17) - 3 = 150\n     \\]\n     Now compute \\( c \\):\n     \\[\n     8c = 150 + 2 = 152 \\implies c = \\frac{152}{8} = 19\n     \\]\n   Here, we have valid integers \\( n = 150 \\), \\( c = 19 \\), and \\( d = 17 \\).\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - For \\( n = 150 \\) and \\( c = 19 \\):\n     - In 8 rows: \\( 8 \\times 19 = 152 \\) positions, 152 - 150 = 2 unoccupied.\n     - In 9 rows: \\( 9 \\times 17 = 153 \\) positions, 153 - 150 = 3 unoccupied.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied with \\( n \\) falling between 100 and 200. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>150</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members."
