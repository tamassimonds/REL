  "solution": "To solve for \\( N \\), the number of permutations of the string \\( AAAABBBBBCCCCCC \\) under specific constraints, we will analyze the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **String Structure**: \n   The string contains 4 \\( A \\)'s, 5 \\( B \\)'s, and 6 \\( C \\)'s, totaling 15 characters.\n\n2. **Position Constraints**:\n   - The first 4 characters cannot contain \\( A \\): only \\( B \\)'s and \\( C \\)'s are allowed.\n   - The next 5 characters cannot contain \\( B \\): only \\( A \\)'s and \\( C \\)'s are allowed.\n   - The last 6 characters cannot contain \\( C \\): only \\( A \\)'s and \\( B \\)'s are allowed.\n\n3. **Defining Variables**:\n   - Let \\( x_1 \\) be the number of \\( B \\)'s in the first 4 positions and \\( y_1 \\) the number of \\( C \\)'s:\n     \\[\n     x_1 + y_1 = 4\n     \\]\n   - For the next 5-character segment, let \\( x_2 \\) be the number of \\( A \\)'s and \\( y_2 \\) the number of \\( C \\)'s:\n     \\[\n     x_2 + y_2 = 5\n     \\]\n   - For the last 6-character segment, let \\( x_3 \\) be the number of \\( A \\)'s and \\( y_3 \\) the number of \\( B \\)'s:\n     \\[\n     x_3 + y_3 = 6\n     \\]\n\n4. **Counting Total Letters**:\n   We know:\n   - Total \\( A \\)'s: \\( x_2 + x_3 = 4 \\)\n   - Total \\( B \\)'s: \\( x_1 + y_3 = 5 \\)\n   - Total \\( C \\)'s: \\( y_1 + y_2 = 6 \\)\n\n5. **Establishing Relationships**:\n   From these equations, we get:\n   \\[\n   y_1 = 4 - x_1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y_2 = 5 - x_2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y_3 = 6 - x_3\n   \\]\n\n6. **Combining Conditions**:\n   Using \\( x_3 = 4 - x_2 \\), we can express \\( y_3 \\):\n   \\[\n   y_3 = 2 + x_2\n   \\]\n   Substituting into the total letter equations yields:\n   \\[\n   (4 - x_1) + (5 - x_2) + (2 + x_2) = 11 - x_1\n   \\]\n   Setting this equal to the total number of \\( C \\)'s (6):\n   \\[\n   11 - x_1 = 6 \\implies x_1 = 5\n   \\]\n   This contradiction shows that we need to consider valid ranges for \\( x_1, x_2 \\).\n\n7. **Iterating Valid Combinations**:\n   Let \\( k \\) be the number of \\( A \\)'s in the middle 5 positions. The possible values for \\( k \\) are 0 to 3, leading to the derived counts of \\( B \\)'s in the first segment:\n   - For \\( k = 0 \\): \\( y_1 = 4 \\)\n   - For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( y_1 = 3 \\)\n   - For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( y_1 = 2 \\)\n   - For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( y_1 = 1 \\)\n\nThe total configurations can thus be computed as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{3} \\binom{4}{k+1} \\binom{5}{k} \\binom{6}{k+2}\n\\]\n\n8. **Calculating the Total**:\nEvaluating this:\n- For \\( k = 0 \\): \\( \\binom{4}{1} \\binom{5}{0} \\binom{6}{2} = 4 \\times 1 \\times 15 = 60 \\)\n- For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{5}{1} \\binom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 5 \\times 20 = 600 \\)\n- For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( \\binom{4}{3} \\binom{5}{2} \\binom{6}{4} = 4 \\times 10 \\times 15 = 600 \\)\n- For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( \\binom{4}{4} \\binom{5}{3} \\binom{6}{5} = 1 \\times 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\)\n\nSumming these gives:\n\\[\n60 + 600 + 600 + 60 = 1320\n\\]\n\nFinally, we take \\( N \\equiv 1320 \\mod 1000 \\equiv 320 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>320</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let there be $k$ As amongst the five numbers in the middle (those mentioned in condition [2]). There are $4-k$ As amongst the last six numbers then. Also, there are $5-k$ Cs amongst the middle five numbers, and so there are $6-(5-k) = k+1$ Cs amongst the first four numbers.\nThus, there are ${4 \\choose k+1}$ ways to arrange the first four numbers, ${5 \\choose k}$ ways to arrange the middle five numbers, and ${6 \\choose 4-k} = {6\\choose k+2}$ ways to arrange the last six numbers. Notice that $k=4$ leads to a contradiction, so the desired sum is\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{3} {4\\choose k+1}{5\\choose k}{6\\choose k+2} = 60 + 600 + 600 + 60 = 1320\\]And $N \\equiv \\boxed{320} \\pmod{1000}$."
