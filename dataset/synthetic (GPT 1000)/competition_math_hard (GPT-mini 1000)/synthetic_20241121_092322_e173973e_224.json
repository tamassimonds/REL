  "problem": "On Monday, Jessica told two friends a secret. On Tuesday, each of those friends told the secret to two other friends. Each time a student heard the secret, he or she told the secret to two other friends the following day. On what day of the week will 1023 students know the secret?",
  "solution": "To determine how many days it will take for 1023 students to learn a secret, we can track how the secret spreads day by day:\n\n1. **Initial Communication**:\n   - **Day 1 (Monday)**: Jessica tells 2 friends, resulting in a total of 3 people (Jessica + 2 friends).\n\n2. **Daily Spread**:\n   - **Day 2 (Tuesday)**: The 2 friends each tell 2 more friends, bringing the total to 7 (3 + 4 new learners).\n   - **Day 3 (Wednesday)**: The 4 new friends tell 2 each, cumulating to 15 (7 + 8 new learners).\n   - **Day 4 (Thursday)**: The 8 new friends tell 2 each, yielding 31 people (15 + 16 new learners).\n   - **Day 5 (Friday)**: The 16 new friends tell 2 each, totaling 63 people (31 + 32 new learners).\n   - **Day 6 (Saturday)**: The 32 new friends tell 2 each, resulting in 127 people (63 + 64 new learners).\n   - **Day 7 (Sunday)**: The 64 new friends tell 2 each, leading to 255 people (127 + 128 new learners).\n   - **Day 8 (Next Monday)**: The 128 new friends tell 2 each, bringing the total to 511 people (255 + 256 new learners).\n   - **Day 9 (Next Tuesday)**: The 256 new friends tell 2 each, reaching the target of 1023 people (511 + 512 new learners).\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   After tracking the spread over 9 days, we find that on Day 9 (the second Tuesday after Jessica initially shared the secret), 1023 students will know it.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>Tuesday</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "On the first day, $1+2=3$ students know the secret.  On the second day, $1+2+4=7$ students know the secret.  On the third day, $1+2+4+8=15$ students know the secret.  Notice that each of these sums is one less than the next power of 2.  Therefore, on the $n$th day, $1+2+\\cdots+2^n=2^{n+1}-1$ students know the secret.  Setting $2^{n+1}-1=1023$, we find $2^{n+1}=1024\\implies n+1=10\\implies n=9$.  We counted Monday as the first day, so the eighth day is Monday and the ninth day is $\\boxed{\\text{Tuesday}}$.\n\nNote: To show that $1+2+\\cdots+2^n=2^{n+1}-1$, define the sum to be $s$ and multiply both sides of   \\[\ns=1+2+\\cdots+2^n,\n\\]by 2 to find \\[\n2s=2+4+\\cdots+2^{n+1}.\n\\]Subtract the first equation from the second to obtain $s=2^{n+1}-1$."
