  "problem": "On a standard die one of the dots is removed at random with each dot equally likely to be chosen. The die is then rolled. What is the probability that the top face has an odd number of dots?",
  "solution": "To find the probability that the top face of a standard die shows an odd number of dots after randomly removing one dot, we can break down the process into clear steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Dot Distribution\nA standard die has faces with the following number of dots:\n- Face 1: 1 dot (odd)\n- Face 2: 2 dots (even)\n- Face 3: 3 dots (odd)\n- Face 4: 4 dots (even)\n- Face 5: 5 dots (odd)\n- Face 6: 6 dots (even)\n\nThe total number of dots on the die is:\n\\[ \n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 \\text{ dots} \n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Effect of Removing Each Dot\nWhen one dot is removed from each face, we need to analyze the resulting number of dots:\n- **Face 1** (1 dot \u2192 0 dots): becomes even\n- **Face 2** (2 dots \u2192 1 dot): becomes odd\n- **Face 3** (3 dots \u2192 2 dots): becomes even\n- **Face 4** (4 dots \u2192 3 dots): becomes odd\n- **Face 5** (5 dots \u2192 4 dots): becomes even\n- **Face 6** (6 dots \u2192 5 dots): becomes odd\n\n### Step 3: Count Favorable Outcomes for Odd Results\nNext, we count the total ways to end up with an odd number of dots after removing one dot:\n- Removing from **Face 1**: 0 outcomes (1 dot becomes 0)\n- Removing from **Face 2**: 1 outcome (2 dots become 1)\n- Removing from **Face 3**: 0 outcomes (3 dots become 2)\n- Removing from **Face 4**: 1 outcome (4 dots become 3)\n- Removing from **Face 5**: 0 outcomes (5 dots become 4)\n- Removing from **Face 6**: 1 outcome (6 dots become 5)\n\nTotal favorable outcomes resulting in an odd number of dots:\n\\[ \n1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\text{ favorable outcomes} \n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Total Outcomes\nThe total possible outcomes when one dot is removed is:\n\\[ \n\\text{Total outcomes} = 21 \n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Initial Probability\nNow, we find the probability \\( P \\) that the top face shows an odd number of dots after one dot is removed:\n\\[\nP(\\text{odd number of dots}) = \\frac{3 \\text{ (favorable outcomes)}}{21 \\text{ (total outcomes)}} = \\frac{1}{7}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Adjust for Each Face Being on Top\nNext, we account for the fact that each face can be on top with equal probability of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\). We need to consider the probability of each face showing an odd number of dots after a dot is removed:\n\n- **Face 1**: \\( 0 \\) (cannot be odd)\n- **Face 2**: \\( \\frac{2}{21} \\)\n- **Face 3**: \\( 0 \\) (cannot be odd)\n- **Face 4**: \\( \\frac{4}{21} \\)\n- **Face 5**: \\( 0 \\) (cannot be odd)\n- **Face 6**: \\( \\frac{6}{21} \\)\n\nThus, the combined probability that the top face shows an odd number of dots is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{top face odd}) = \\frac{1}{6} \\left(0 + \\frac{2}{21} + 0 + \\frac{4}{21} + 0 + \\frac{6}{21}\\right)\n= \\frac{1}{6} \\left(\\frac{12}{21}\\right)\n= \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{4}{7}\n= \\frac{4}{42} = \\frac{2}{21}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the final probability that the top face has an odd number of dots is \n\\(\\frac{11}{21}\\).",
  "ground_truth": "The dot is chosen from the face with $n$ dots with probability $\\frac{n}{21}$. Thus the face that originally has $n$ dots is left with an odd number of dots with probability $\\frac{n}{21}$ if $n$ is even and $1 - n/21$ if $n$ is odd. Each face is the top face with probability $\\frac{1}{6}$. Therefore the top face has an odd number of dots with probability \\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{1}{6}\\displaystyle\\left(\\displaystyle\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{21}\\displaystyle\\right) + \\frac{2}{21} + \\displaystyle\\left(1 - \\frac{3}{21}\\displaystyle\\right)\n+ \\frac{4}{21} + \\displaystyle\\left(1 - \\frac{5}{21}\\displaystyle\\right) + \\frac{6}{21}\\displaystyle\\right) \\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{1}{6} \\displaystyle\\left(3 + \\frac{3}{21}\\displaystyle\\right)\\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{1}{6}\\cdot \\frac{66}{21} \\\\\n& \\qquad = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{21}}.\n\\end{align*}"
