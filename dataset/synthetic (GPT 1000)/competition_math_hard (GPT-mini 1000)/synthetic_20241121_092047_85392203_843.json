  "problem": "Let $p(x)$ be a quadratic polynomial such that $[p(x)]^3 - x$ is divisible by $(x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 8).$  Find $p(13).$",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we consider the polynomial \\( f(x) = [p(x)]^3 - x \\), which is divisible by \\( (x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 8) \\). This means that \\( f(1) = 0 \\), \\( f(-1) = 0 \\), and \\( f(8) = 0 \\). We will use these points to find the polynomial \\( p(x) \\).\n\n1. **Calculating \\( f(1) \\)**:\n   \\[\n   f(1) = [p(1)]^3 - 1 = 0 \\implies [p(1)]^3 = 1 \\implies p(1) = 1.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculating \\( f(-1) \\)**:\n   \\[\n   f(-1) = [p(-1)]^3 + 1 = 0 \\implies [p(-1)]^3 = -1 \\implies p(-1) = -1.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating \\( f(8) \\)**:\n   \\[\n   f(8) = [p(8)]^3 - 8 = 0 \\implies [p(8)]^3 = 8 \\implies p(8) = 2.\n   \\]\n\nNow we have the following evaluations for \\( p(x) \\):\n- \\( p(1) = 1 \\)\n- \\( p(-1) = -1 \\)\n- \\( p(8) = 2 \\)\n\nNext, we assume that \\( p(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial given by \\( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\) and set up a system of equations using the conditions:\n\n1. From \\( p(1) = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   a + b + c = 1 \\tag{1}\n   \\]\n   \n2. From \\( p(-1) = -1 \\):\n   \\[\n   a - b + c = -1 \\tag{2}\n   \\]\n   \n3. From \\( p(8) = 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   64a + 8b + c = 2 \\tag{3}\n   \\]\n\nNow we have three equations to solve:\n\n**Step 1**: Subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1):\n\\[\n(a + b + c) - (a - b + c) = 1 + 1 \\implies 2b = 2 \\implies b = 1.\n\\]\n\n**Step 2**: Substitute \\( b = 1 \\) into Equation (1):\n\\[\na + 1 + c = 1 \\implies a + c = 0 \\implies c = -a \\tag{4}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 3**: Substitute \\( b = 1 \\) and \\( c = -a \\) into Equation (3):\n\\[\n64a + 8(1) + (-a) = 2 \\implies 64a - a + 8 = 2 \\implies 63a + 8 = 2 \\implies 63a = -6 \\implies a = -\\frac{2}{21}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 4**: Now, substitute \\( a = -\\frac{2}{21} \\) back into Equation (4) to find \\( c \\):\n\\[\nc = -\\left(-\\frac{2}{21}\\right) = \\frac{2}{21}.\n\\]\n\nWith \\( b = 1 \\), we summarize the coefficients:\n\\[\np(x) = -\\frac{2}{21}x^2 + 1x + \\frac{2}{21}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find \\( p(13) \\):\n\\[\np(13) = -\\frac{2}{21}(13^2) + 13 + \\frac{2}{21} = -\\frac{2}{21}(169) + 13 + \\frac{2}{21} = -\\frac{338}{21} + \\frac{273}{21} + \\frac{2}{21} = -\\frac{338 - 273 - 2}{21} = -\\frac{63}{21} = -3.\n\\]\n\nThus, we conclude:\n\\[\np(13) = -3.\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n<ANSWER>-3</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "By Factor Theorem, we want $[p(x)]^3 - x$ to be equal to 0 at $x = 1,$ $x = -1,$ and $x = 8.$  Thus, $p(1) = 1,$ $p(-1) = -1,$ and $p(8) = 2.$\n\nSince $p(x)$ is quadratic, let $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.$  Then\n\\begin{align*}\na + b + c &= 1, \\\\\na - b + c &= -1, \\\\\n64a + 8b + c &= 2.\n\\end{align*}Solving this system, we find $a = -\\frac{2}{21},$ $b = 1,$ and $c = \\frac{2}{21}.$  Hence,\n\\[p(x) = -\\frac{2}{21} x^2 + x + \\frac{2}{21},\\]so $p(13) = -\\frac{2}{21} \\cdot 13^2 + 13 + \\frac{2}{21} = \\boxed{-3}.$"
