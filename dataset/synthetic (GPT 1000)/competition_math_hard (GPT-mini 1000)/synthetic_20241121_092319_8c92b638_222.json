  "problem": "On the island of Mumble, the Mumblian alphabet has only $5$ letters, and every word in the Mumblian language has no more than $3$ letters in it. How many words are possible? (A word can use a letter more than once, but $0$ letters does not count as a word.)",
  "solution": "To calculate the total number of words that can be formed in the Mumblian language, we will analyze words based on their lengths, which can range from \\(1\\) to \\(3\\) letters. The Mumblian alphabet consists of \\(5\\) distinct letters.\n\n### Word Lengths and Possibilities\n\n#### 1. Words of Length 1\nFor a \\(1\\)-letter word, we can choose any one of the \\(5\\) letters:\n\\[\n5^1 = 5\n\\]\nSo, there are \\(5\\) possible \\(1\\)-letter words.\n\n#### 2. Words of Length 2\nFor a \\(2\\)-letter word, each of the two positions can be filled by any of the \\(5\\) letters. Therefore, the number of \\(2\\)-letter combinations is:\n\\[\n5^2 = 5 \\times 5 = 25\n\\]\nThis gives us \\(25\\) possible \\(2\\)-letter words.\n\n#### 3. Words of Length 3\nFollowing the same logic, for a \\(3\\)-letter word, each of the three positions can again be filled by any of the \\(5\\) letters:\n\\[\n5^3 = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\n\\]\nThus, there are \\(125\\) possible \\(3\\)-letter words.\n\n### Total Number of Words\nNow, we sum the number of words of all lengths:\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of words} = \\text{Words of length 1} + \\text{Words of length 2} + \\text{Words of length 3}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 5 + 25 + 125\n\\]\nCalculating this, we get:\n\\[\n5 + 25 = 30\n\\]\n\\[\n30 + 125 = 155\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the total number of possible words in the Mumblian language is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total words} = 155\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>155</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Often, the tricky part of casework problems is deciding what the cases should be. For this problem, it makes sense to use as our cases the number of letters in each word.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 1: (1-letter words) There are $5$ 1-letter words (each of the $5$ letters is itself a 1-letter word).\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 2: (2-letter words) To form a 2-letter word, we have $5$ choices for our first letter, and $5$ choices for our second letter. Thus there are $5 \\times 5 = 25$ 2-letter words possible.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 3: (3-letter words) To form a 3-letter word, we have $5$ choices for our first letter, $5$ choices for our second letter, and $5$ choices for our third letter. Thus there are $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125$ 3-letter words possible.\n\nSo to get the total number of words in the language, we add the number of words from each of our cases. (We need to make sure that the cases are exclusive, meaning they don't overlap. But that's clear in this solution, since, for example, a word can't be both a 2-letter word and a 3-letter word at the same time.)\n\nTherefore there are $5 + 25 + 125 = \\boxed{155}$ words possible on Mumble. (I guess the Mumblians don't have a lot to say.)"
