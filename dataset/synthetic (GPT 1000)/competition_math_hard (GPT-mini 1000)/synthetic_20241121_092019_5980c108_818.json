  "problem": "What is the range of the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$?",
  "solution": "To determine the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\), we will follow a systematic approach.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Domain\nThe function includes a division by \\( x^2 \\), which is undefined when \\( x^2 = 0 \\). This occurs only at \\( x = 0 \\). Consequently, the domain of the function is:\n\n\\[\nx \\in (-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Function\nNext, we need to evaluate the possible values of \\( f(x) \\). Since \\( x^2 \\) is always positive for any \\( x \\neq 0 \\), \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) will also be positive.\n\n- As \\( |x| \\) (the absolute value of \\( x \\)) increases (i.e., as \\( x \\) approaches positive or negative infinity), \\( x^2 \\) becomes larger, leading to a decrease in \\( f(x) \\). Specifically:\n  - When \\( x \\) approaches \\( 0 \\) from either direction (positive or negative), \\( f(x) \\) trends towards infinity:\n    \\[\n    \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = \\infty \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f(x) = \\infty\n    \\]\n  - Conversely, as \\( |x| \\) approaches infinity, \\( f(x) \\) approaches \\( 0 \\):\n    \\[\n    \\lim_{|x| \\to \\infty} f(x) = 0\n    \\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Range\nFrom our analysis, we see that \\( f(x) \\) can take all positive values, starting from values close to \\( 0 \\) (but never reaching it) and increasing indefinitely as \\( x \\) approaches \\( 0 \\). Thus, the range of the function encompasses all positive real numbers. Therefore, in interval notation, the range is:\n\n\\[\n(0, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is:\n\n<ANSWER>(0, \\infty)</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Note that $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} >0$ for all nonzero $x$. That is, the range of $f$ must only include positive numbers. Conversely, if $a$ is a positive number, then \\[f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\right)=\\frac{1}{(1/\\sqrt{a})^2} = a,\\]so $a$ is indeed in the range of $f$. Thus, the range of $f$ is the set of all positive real numbers; in interval notation, that's $\\boxed{(0,\\infty)}$."
