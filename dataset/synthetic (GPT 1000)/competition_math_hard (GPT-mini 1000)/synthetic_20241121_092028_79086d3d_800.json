  "problem": "For how many values of $a$ is it true that:\n(1) $a$ is a positive integer such that $a \\le 50$.\n(2) the quadratic equation $x^2 + (2a+1)x + a^2 = 0$ has two integer solutions?",
  "solution": "To find how many values of \\( a \\) satisfy the given conditions for the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + (2a + 1)x + a^2 = 0 \\), we will follow the steps below:\n\n1. **Discriminant Analysis**: The roots of the quadratic can be determined using the quadratic formula. The discriminant must be a perfect square for the roots to be integers. The discriminant \\( D \\) is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   D = (2a + 1)^2 - 4(1)(a^2) = 4a + 1.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perfect Square Condition**: For \\( D = 4a + 1 \\) to be a perfect square, we set:\n   \\[\n   k^2 = 4a + 1 \\quad \\text{for some integer } k.\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{k^2 - 1}{4}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divisibility by 4**: For \\( a \\) to be a positive integer, \\( k^2 - 1 \\) must be divisible by 4. Observing \\( k^2 - 1 = (k - 1)(k + 1) \\), we note that since \\( k - 1 \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) are consecutive integers, if \\( k \\) is odd, both terms are even, ensuring their product is divisible by 4.\n\n4. **Generating Odd Integers**: We express \\( k \\) as \\( k = 2m + 1 \\) (where \\( m \\) is an integer) and substitute into the equation for \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   k^2 = (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 \\implies 4a + 1 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 \\implies a = m(m + 1).\n   \\]\n\n5. **Bound Constraints**: We require \\( a \\leq 50 \\):\n   \\[\n   m(m + 1) \\leq 50.\n   \\]\n   To find the largest integer \\( m \\), we solve the inequality \\( m^2 + m - 50 \\leq 0 \\).\n\n6. **Finding Roots of the Quadratic**: Using the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 200}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{201}}{2}.\n   \\]\n   Approximating \\( \\sqrt{201} \\approx 14.177 \\), we find \\( m \\approx \\frac{-1 + 14.177}{2} \\approx 6.588 \\). Therefore, the largest valid integer \\( m \\) is 6.\n\n7. **Calculating Valid \\( a \\) Values**: We compute \\( a = m(m + 1) \\) for \\( m = 1 \\) to \\( 6 \\):\n   - \\( m = 1 \\): \\( a = 2 \\)\n   - \\( m = 2 \\): \\( a = 6 \\)\n   - \\( m = 3 \\): \\( a = 12 \\)\n   - \\( m = 4 \\): \\( a = 20 \\)\n   - \\( m = 5 \\): \\( a = 30 \\)\n   - \\( m = 6 \\): \\( a = 42 \\)\n\nAll these values of \\( a \\) (2, 6, 12, 20, 30, and 42) are valid as they meet the condition \\( a \\leq 50 \\).\n\n8. **Counting Valid Values**: The total number of valid \\( a \\) values is \\( 6 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER> 6 </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "If the quadratic equation $x^2 + (2a+1)x + a^2 = 0$ has two integer solutions, then $$x = \\frac{-2a-1 \\pm \\sqrt{(2a+1)^2 - 4a^2}}{2}$$is an integer, so it follows that the discriminant $(2a+1)^2 - 4a^2 = 4a + 1$ must be a perfect square. Also, $1 \\le a \\le 50$, so it follows that $5 \\le 4a+1 \\le 201$. Clearly $4a+1$ can only be the square of an odd integer; conversely, the square of any odd integer $(2n+1)^2$ is of the form $4n^2 + 4n+1 = 4(n^2 + n) + 1$ and so can be written as $4a+1$. The odd perfect squares from $5$ to $201$ are given by $9 = 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, 9^2, 11^2, 169 = 13^2$, so it follows that there are $\\boxed{6}$ such values of $a$."
