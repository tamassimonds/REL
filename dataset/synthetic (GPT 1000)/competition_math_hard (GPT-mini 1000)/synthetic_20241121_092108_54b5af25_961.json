  "problem": "A square has two diagonals, and a convex pentagon has five diagonals.  How many diagonals does a convex decagon have?",
  "solution": "To find the number of diagonals in a convex decagon (a polygon with 10 sides), we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{n(n - 3)}{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) represents the number of sides in the polygon.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1. **Identify \\( n \\)**: For a decagon, \\( n = 10 \\).\n\n2. **Substitute \\( n \\) into the formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{10(10 - 3)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the expression**:\n   Calculate \\( 10 - 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   10 - 3 = 7\n   \\]\n\n   Substitute this value back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{10 \\times 7}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply**:\n   Compute \\( 10 \\times 7 \\):\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 7 = 70\n   \\]\n\n5. **Divide by 2**:\n   Finally, divide \\( 70 \\) by \\( 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{70}{2} = 35\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the number of diagonals in a convex decagon is **35**.",
  "ground_truth": "A convex $n$-gon has $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$ diagonals. Thus, a convex decagon has $\\frac{10\\cdot 7}{2} = \\boxed{35}$ diagonals."
