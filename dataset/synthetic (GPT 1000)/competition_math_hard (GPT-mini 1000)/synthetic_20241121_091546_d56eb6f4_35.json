  "problem": "The trip from Carville to Nikpath requires $4\\frac 12$ hours when traveling at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. How many hours does the trip require when traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
  "solution": "To determine how long the trip from Carville to Nikpath takes at an average speed of 60 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the distance from Carville to Nikpath.**\n\nTraveling at an average speed of 70 miles per hour takes 4.5 hours (which is the decimal equivalent of $4\\frac{1}{2}$ hours). We can find the distance using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = 70 \\text{ mph} \\times 4.5 \\text{ hours} = 315 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the travel time at 60 miles per hour.**\n\nNow, using the distance we found, we calculate the time required to cover the same distance at a speed of 60 miles per hour with the rearranged formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{315 \\text{ miles}}{60 \\text{ mph}} = 5.25 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThus, the trip from Carville to Nikpath takes 5.25 hours at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n<ANSWER>5.25</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since $\\text{distance}=\\text{rate}\\times\\text{time}$, decreasing speed by a factor of $\\frac{6}{7}$ increases the amount of time the trip takes by $\\frac{7}{6}$.  Therefore, at 60 miles per hour the trip takes $4\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{7}{6}=\\frac{9}{2}\\cdot\\frac{7}{6}=\\frac{21}{4}=\\boxed{5.25}$ hours."
