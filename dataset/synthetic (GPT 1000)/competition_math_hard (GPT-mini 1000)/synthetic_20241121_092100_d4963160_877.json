  "problem": "An ancient human tribe had a hierarchical system where there existed one chief with 2 supporting chiefs (supporting chief A and supporting chief B), each of whom had 2 equal, inferior officers. If the tribe at one point had 10 members, what is the number of different ways to choose the leadership of the tribe?  That is, in how many ways can we choose a chief, 2 supporting chiefs, and two inferior officers reporting to each supporting chief?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of different ways to establish the leadership of the tribe with a specified hierarchy, we can follow a systematic approach, considering each leadership position and its dependencies.\n\n### Step 1: Choosing the Chief\nWe start by selecting one chief from the 10 tribe members. The number of ways to select the chief is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to choose the Chief} = 10\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Choosing the Supporting Chiefs\nAfter the chief is chosen, there are 9 members left to select 2 supporting chiefs (let's call them Supporting Chief A and Supporting Chief B). The selection process is as follows:\n\n1. **Choose Supporting Chief A:** There are 9 options (any member except the chief).\n2. **Choose Supporting Chief B:** After Choosing Supporting Chief A, 8 members remain available.\n\nThus, the total number of ways to choose the two supporting chiefs is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to choose Supporting Chiefs} = 9 \\times 8 = 72\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Choosing Inferior Officers for Supporting Chief A\nWith the chief and the two supporting chiefs selected, 7 tribe members remain. We now select 2 inferior officers for Supporting Chief A. This can be done using combinations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to choose Inferior Officers for Supporting Chief A} = \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Choosing Inferior Officers for Supporting Chief B\nNext, we need to choose 2 inferior officers for Supporting Chief B from the remaining 5 tribe members. The calculation, similar to the previous step, is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to choose Inferior Officers for Supporting Chief B} = \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Total Combinations\nFinally, we calculate the total number of ways to form the leadership by multiplying the number of ways at each step:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Ways} = (\\text{Ways to choose Chief}) \\times (\\text{Ways to choose Supporting Chiefs}) \\times (\\text{Ways to choose Inferior Officers for A}) \\times (\\text{Ways to choose Inferior Officers for B})\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Ways} = 10 \\times 72 \\times 21 \\times 10\n\\]\n\nNow, calculating this step-by-step:\n\n1. \\( 10 \\times 72 = 720 \\)\n2. \\( 720 \\times 21 = 15120 \\)\n3. \\( 15120 \\times 10 = 151200 \\)\n\nThus, the total number of different ways to choose the leadership of the tribe is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Ways} = 151200\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe total number of different ways to choose the leadership of the tribe is:\n\n<ANSWER>151200</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "There are 10 choices for the chief.  For each choice, there are 9 ways to choose supporting chief A, then 8 ways to choose supporting chief B.  There are then $\\binom{7}{2}$ ways to choose the inferior officers for the supporting chief A and $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose the inferior officers for the supporting chief B.  This gives us a total of $10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot \\binom{7}{2}\\cdot\\binom{5}{2} = \\boxed{151200}$ ways to form the leadership of the tribe."
