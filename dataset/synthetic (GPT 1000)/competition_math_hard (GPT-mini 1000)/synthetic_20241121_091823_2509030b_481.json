  "problem": "A triangle has a side of length 6 cm, a side of length 8 cm and a right angle. What is the shortest possible length of the remaining side of the triangle? Express your answer in centimeters as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
  "solution": "To determine the shortest possible length of the remaining side of a right triangle with known sides of 6 cm and 8 cm, we will use the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Sides\n\nWe have:\n- Side \\( a = 6 \\text{ cm} \\)\n- Side \\( b = 8 \\text{ cm} \\)\n- The angle between these sides is \\( 90^\\circ \\).\n\nWe need to find the length of the hypotenuse \\( c \\) and explore the scenario where one of the given sides may instead serve as the hypotenuse.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, the relationship in a right triangle is:\n\n\\[\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Length of the Hypotenuse\n\n1. Calculate the squares:\n   \\[\n   a^2 = 6^2 = 36\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 8^2 = 64\n   \\]\n\n2. Sum these values:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + b^2 = 36 + 64 = 100\n   \\]\n\n3. Find \\( c \\) by taking the square root:\n   \\[\n   c = \\sqrt{100} = 10 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Explore Alternate Scenarios\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider the possibility of one of the known sides being the hypotenuse.\n\n1. **If 8 cm is the hypotenuse**:\n   We calculate the remaining side \\( x \\) using:\n   \\[\n   6^2 + x^2 = 8^2\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   36 + x^2 = 64\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   x^2 = 64 - 36 = 28 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\sqrt{28} \\approx 5.29 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **If 6 cm is the hypotenuse**:\n   This scenario is not valid because the hypotenuse must be longer than either of the other two sides.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter considering both scenarios, the shortest possible length of the remaining side, when the 8 cm side is treated as the hypotenuse, is approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5.29 \\text{ cm}}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The remaining side is minimized if it is a leg of the triangle rather than the hypotenuse.  Then its length is $\\sqrt{8^2 - 6^2} = 2\\sqrt 7\\approx \\boxed{5.29}$ cm."
