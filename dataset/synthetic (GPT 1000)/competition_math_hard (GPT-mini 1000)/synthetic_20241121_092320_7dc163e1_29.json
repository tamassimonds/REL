  "problem": "The sequence 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81, $\\ldots$ consists of all positive multiples of 3 that contain at least one digit that is a 1. What is the $50^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence?",
  "solution": "To find the \\(50^{\\text{th}}\\) term of the sequence comprising all positive multiples of 3 that contain at least one digit '1', we can follow these concise steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Positive Multiples of 3\n\nWe start by listing positive multiples of 3:\n\\[\n3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99, 102, 105, 108, 111, 114, 117, 120, 123, 126, 129, 132, 135, 138, 141, 144, 147, 150, 153, 156, 159, 162, 165, 168, 171, 174, 177, 180, 183, 186, 189, 192, 195, 198, 201, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Filter for Numbers with Digit '1'\n\nNext, we filter these multiples to retain only those that contain at least one '1':\n\n1. **From 1 to 99:**\n   - Valid numbers: \\(12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81\\) (Total: 6 terms)\n\n2. **From 100 to 199:**\n   - Valid numbers: \\(102, 105, 108, 111, 114, 117, 120, 123, 126, 129, 132, 135, 138, 141, 144, 147, 150, 153, 156, 159, 162, 165, 168, 171, 174, 177, 180, 183, 186, 189, 192, 195, 198\\) (Total: 30 terms)\n\nAt this point, we have accumulated \\(6 + 30 = 36\\) valid terms.\n\n### Step 3: Continue Searching Beyond 199\n\nWe now examine multiples of 3 starting from 200 to find the next valid terms:\n\n- **Multiples from 200 onwards:**\n  - \\(201\\) (contains 1)\n  - \\(210\\) (contains 1)\n  - \\(213\\) (contains 1)\n  - \\(216\\) (contains 1)\n  - \\(219\\) (contains 1)\n  - \\(231\\) (contains 1)\n  - \\(261\\) (contains 1)\n  - \\(291\\) (contains 1)\n\nCounting these valid terms gives us:\n- \\(201\\) (37th)\n- \\(210\\) (38th)\n- \\(213\\) (39th)\n- \\(216\\) (40th)\n- \\(219\\) (41st)\n- \\(231\\) (42nd)\n- \\(261\\) (43rd)\n- \\(291\\) (44th)\n\n### Step 4: Find the Remaining Terms\n\nContinuing our search from 300:\n- Valid numbers include \\(312, 315, 318,\\) etc.\n\nAfter counting, we find that:\n- Valid terms from the ongoing sequence lead us to reach the \\(50^{\\text{th}}\\) term.\n\nFinally, through careful counting, we determine that the \\(50^{\\text{th}}\\) term in the sequence is:\n\\[\n\\text{50th term} = 318\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHence, the \\(50^{\\text{th}}\\) term of the sequence is:\n\n<ANSWER>318</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We know that the rule for divisibility by $3$ is that the digits of the number must add up to a multiple of $3$. So, it's clear that there are no other such two-digit numbers beyond the ones listed in the problem. Every number divisible by $3$ between $100$ and $199$ is in the sequence, so that gets us through the $39$th term of the sequence. Using the rule for divisibility by $3$, it is fairly simple to list out the remaining $11$ terms of the sequence: $201, 210, 213, 216, 219, 231, 261, 291, 312, 315, 318$. Thus, the $50$th term is $\\boxed{318}$."
