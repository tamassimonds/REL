  "problem": "Every 5 months, Hal has to replace the batteries in his calculator. He changed them the first time in May. In what month will they be changed the 25th time?",
  "solution": "To determine when Hal will change the batteries for the 25th time, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Starting Month**: The first battery change occurs in May.\n\n2. **Change Interval**: Hal changes his batteries every 5 months.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Time for 25th Change**: Since the first change is in May (month 0), we need to calculate the total months until the 25th change. The changes occur at the following intervals:\n   - 1st change: Month 0 (May)\n   - 2nd change: Month 5 (October)\n   - 3rd change: Month 10 (February), and so on.\n\n4. **Formula for Total Months**: To find the month of the 25th change, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Months} = (\\text{Change Number} - 1) \\times \\text{Interval}\n   \\]\n   For the 25th change, this becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Months} = (25 - 1) \\times 5 = 24 \\times 5 = 120 \\text{ months}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert Months to Years**: To find out what month it is after 120 months, we divide by 12 to convert to years:\n   \\[\n   120 \\div 12 = 10 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n   Since the initial change was in May, adding 10 years to May results in May of the year 10 years later.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Hal will change the batteries for the 25th time in **May**, after 10 years since the first change.\n\n**Final Answer**: <ANSWER>May solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "If the first time was in May, the second time will be 5 months after May, the third time will be $5\\cdot2$ months after May, etc. That means the 25th time will be $5\\cdot24$ months away. Since the months repeat every 12 months, we look for the remainder when $5\\cdot24$ is divided by 12 and add that many months to May. We notice that $\\frac{5\\cdot24}{12}=5\\cdot2$, so it turns out that $5\\cdot24$ is a multiple of 12 and leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 12. So the 25th time will be a certain number of years afterward but still in the same month, $\\boxed{\\text{May}}$."
