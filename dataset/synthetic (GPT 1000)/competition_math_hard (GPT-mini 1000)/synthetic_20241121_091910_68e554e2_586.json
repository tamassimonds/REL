  "problem": "What is the ratio of the area of a square inscribed in a semicircle with radius $r$ to the area of a square inscribed in a circle with radius $r$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To determine the ratio of the areas of a square inscribed in a semicircle to a square inscribed in a circle, we will first calculate each area separately and then compute the ratio.\n\n### Step 1: Area of the Square Inscribed in a Circle\n\n1. **Finding the side length of the square:**\n   - The diagonal of the square is equal to the circle's diameter. For a circle with radius \\( r \\), the diameter \\( D \\) is:\n     \\[\n     D = 2r\n     \\]\n   - If \\( s \\) is the side length of the square, the diagonal \\( d \\) can be expressed using the Pythagorean theorem:\n     \\[\n     d = s \\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n   - Equating the diagonal to the diameter gives us:\n     \\[\n     s \\sqrt{2} = 2r\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( s \\):\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{2}} = r\\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the area of the square:**\n   - The area \\( A_{circle} \\) of the square is:\n     \\[\n     A_{circle} = s^2 = (r\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2r^2\n     \\]\n\n### Step 2: Area of the Square Inscribed in a Semicircle\n\n1. **Finding the side length of the square:**\n   - For the semicircle, the square's base lies along the diameter, and its top vertex touches the semicircle. Let the side length be \\( t \\).\n   - The top vertex has coordinates \\( \\left(\\frac{t}{2}, t\\right) \\) and must satisfy the semicircle's equation \\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\) (for \\( y \\geq 0 \\)):\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)^2 + t^2 = r^2\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{t^2}{4} + t^2 = r^2 \\implies \\frac{5t^2}{4} = r^2 \\implies t^2 = \\frac{4r^2}{5}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, we find:\n     \\[\n     t = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{5}}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the area of the square:**\n   - The area \\( A_{semicircle} \\) of the square is:\n     \\[\n     A_{semicircle} = t^2 = \\frac{4r^2}{5}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 3: Ratio of Areas\n\nNow, we compute the ratio of the area of the square inscribed in the semicircle to the area of the square inscribed in the circle:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{A_{semicircle}}{A_{circle}} = \\frac{\\frac{4r^2}{5}}{2r^2} = \\frac{4r^2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2r^2} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of the square inscribed in the semicircle to the area of the square inscribed in the circle is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let $s_1$ be the side length of the square inscribed in the semicircle of radius $r$.  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle shown in the diagram, we have $(s_1/2)^2+s_1^2=r^2$, which implies $s_1^2=\\frac{4}{5}r^2$.  Let $s_2$ be the side length of the square inscribed in the circle of radius $r$.  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle shown in the diagram, we have $(s_2/2)^2+(s_2/2)^2=r^2$, which implies $s_2^2=2r^2$.  Therefore, the ratio of  the areas of the two squares is $\\dfrac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}=\\dfrac{\\frac{4}{5}r^2}{2r^2}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}}$.
