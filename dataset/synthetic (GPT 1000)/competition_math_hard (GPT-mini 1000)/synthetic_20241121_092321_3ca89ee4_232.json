  "problem": "2 diagonals of a regular heptagon (a 7-sided polygon) are chosen.  What is the probability that they intersect inside the heptagon?",
  "solution": "To find the probability that two diagonals of a regular heptagon intersect inside the heptagon, we can follow these systematic steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Diagonals\nIn a heptagon, which has \\( n = 7 \\) sides, we can use the formula for the number of diagonals \\( D \\):\n\n\\[\nD = \\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( n = 7 \\):\n\n\\[\nD = \\frac{7(7-3)}{2} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 4}{2} = 14\n\\]\n\nThus, there are **14 diagonals** in a heptagon.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Ways to Choose 2 Diagonals\nNext, we find how many ways we can choose 2 diagonals from the 14 available diagonals using the combination formula \\( \\binom{m}{r} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to choose 2 diagonals} = \\binom{14}{2} = \\frac{14 \\cdot 13}{2} = 91\n\\]\n\nSo, there are **91 ways to choose 2 diagonals**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Intersecting Diagonal Scenarios\nTwo diagonals will intersect inside the heptagon if their endpoints form a \"crisscross\" pattern. To determine how many pairs of diagonals intersect, we can select any 4 vertices from the 7. The number of ways to choose 4 vertices from 7 is given by \\( \\binom{7}{4} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{4} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 35\n\\]\n\nThus, there are **35 pairs of diagonals** that intersect inside the heptagon.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability\nThe probability \\( P \\) that two randomly chosen diagonals intersect inside the heptagon is then computed by dividing the number of intersecting diagonal pairs by the total ways to choose any two diagonals:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Number of intersecting pairs}}{\\text{Total pairs of diagonals}} = \\frac{35}{91}\n\\]\n\nTo simplify this fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{35 \\div 7}{91 \\div 7} = \\frac{5}{13}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the probability that two randomly chosen diagonals of a regular heptagon intersect inside the heptagon is:\n\n<ANSWER> \\(\\frac{5}{13}\\) </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{7}{2} = 21$ pairs of points in the heptagon, and all but 7 (the sides of the heptagon) are diagonals, which means there are 14 diagonals.  So there are $\\binom{14}{2} = 91$ pairs of diagonals.  Any four points on the heptagon uniquely determine a pair of intersecting diagonals. (If vertices $A,B,C,D$ are chosen, where $ABCD$ is a convex quadrilateral, the intersecting pair of diagonals are $AC$ and $BD$.)  So the number of sets of intersecting diagonals is the number of combinations of 4 points, which is $\\binom{7}{4} = 35$.  So the probability that a randomly chosen pair of diagonals intersect is $\\dfrac{35}{91} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{13}}$."
