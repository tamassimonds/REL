  "problem": "A regular polygon has sides of length 5 units and an exterior angle of 120 degrees. What is the perimeter of the polygon, in units?",
  "solution": "To find the perimeter of a regular polygon, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the relationship between the exterior angle and the number of sides**: The sum of all exterior angles in any polygon is 360 degrees. For a regular polygon, each exterior angle is equal. Thus, we can calculate the number of sides (\\(n\\)) using the formula:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{360}{\\text{exterior angle}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of sides**: Given an exterior angle of 120 degrees, we substitute this value into the formula:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{360}{120} = 3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Identify the polygon type**: A polygon with 3 sides is a triangle.\n\n4. **Calculate the perimeter**: The perimeter (\\(P\\)) of a regular polygon is found by multiplying the number of sides by the length of each side:\n   \\[\n   P = n \\times \\text{side length}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(n = 3\\) and a side length of 5 units:\n   \\[\n   P = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final answer**: Thus, the perimeter of the polygon is 15 units.",
  "ground_truth": "If an exterior angle has measure $120$ degrees, an interior angle has measure $60$ degrees.  A regular polygon with $60$ degree angles must be an equilateral triangle, so the perimeter is $3(5)=\\boxed{15}$ units."
