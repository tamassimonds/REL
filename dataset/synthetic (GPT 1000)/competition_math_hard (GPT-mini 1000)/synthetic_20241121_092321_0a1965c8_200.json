  "problem": "The average of two 2-digit positive integers is equal to the decimal number obtained by writing one of the two-digit integers before the decimal point and the other two-digit integer after the decimal point. What is the smaller of the two integers?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of finding two-digit integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) with a specific average, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Average Equation\n\nWe start by defining our two-digit integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) where both lie between 10 and 99. The average of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is described by the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{a + b}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Decimal Representation\n\nAccording to the problem, the average also matches the decimal formed by placing one integer before the decimal point and the other after. We can express this mathematically. If we write \\( a \\) before the decimal and \\( b \\) after, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Decimal Representation} = a + \\frac{b}{100}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Set Up the Equation\n\nWe can equate the two expressions for the average:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + b}{2} = a + \\frac{b}{100}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Clear the Fractions\n\nTo eliminate the fractions, we multiply both sides by 200:\n\n\\[\n200 \\left(\\frac{a + b}{2}\\right) = 200 \\left(a + \\frac{b}{100}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n100(a + b) = 200a + 2b\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Rearranging the Equation\n\nDistributing gives us:\n\n\\[\n100a + 100b = 200a + 2b\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we arrive at:\n\n\\[\n100b - 2b = 200a - 100a\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n98b = 100a\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( b \\)\n\nRearranging leads to:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{100a}{98} = \\frac{50a}{49}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Ensure \\( b \\) is Integer\n\nSince both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must be integers, \\( \\frac{50a}{49} \\) must also yield an integer. This condition holds when \\( a \\) is a multiple of 49. The two-digit multiples of 49 are:\n\n- \\( 49 \\) (49 \u00d7 1)\n- \\( 98 \\) (49 \u00d7 2)\n\n### Step 8: Calculate Possible Values of \\( b \\)\n\nNow, we can compute \\( b \\) for each valid \\( a \\):\n\n1. **For \\( a = 49 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{50 \\times 49}{49} = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. **For \\( a = 98 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{50 \\times 98}{49} = 100 \\quad \\text{(not valid as it is not a two-digit integer)}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the only valid pair we find is \\( (49, 50) \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe smaller of the two integers is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{49}\n\\] \n\nThis coherent process leads us to identify the integers fulfilling the given condition effectively.",
  "ground_truth": "Let the two numbers be $m=AB$ and $n=CD$ (where $A,B,C$ and $D$ are digits). The average of $m$ and $n$ is $\\frac{m+n}{2}$ and the number formed by writing $m$ before the decimal point and $n$ after the decimal point is: $$AB.CD = AB + 0.CD = AB+\\frac{CD}{100} = m+\\frac{n}{100}.$$ Setting these equal gives: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{m+n}{2} &= m+\\frac{n}{100}\\\\\n50m+50n &= 100m+n\\\\\n49n &= 50m\n\\end{align*} From this it follows that $n$ a multiple of 50. As $n$ is a 2-digit positive integer this means that $n=50$. So now $50m = 49n = 49\\cdot 50$, so $m=49$. Thus the integers are $49$ and $50$, so the smaller integer is $\\boxed{49}$."
