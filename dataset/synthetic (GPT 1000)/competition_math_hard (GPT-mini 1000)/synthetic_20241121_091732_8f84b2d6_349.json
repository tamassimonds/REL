  "problem": "There is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of distinct ways to arrange eight women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and two men on indistinguishable stools in a single row, we can apply the concept of permutations of indistinguishable objects.\n\n### Summary of the Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Total Seats**: \n   There are 10 seats in total (8 rocking chairs for women and 2 stools for men).\n\n2. **Arrangement Overview**: \n   We need to arrange 8 indistinguishable rocking chairs and 2 indistinguishable stools in these 10 seats.\n\n3. **Permutation Formula**: \n   The number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) objects where \\( n_1 \\) are of one type and \\( n_2 \\) are of another type is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n!}{n_1! \\times n_2!}\n   \\]\n   Here, we have:\n   - \\( n = 10 \\) (total seats),\n   - \\( n_1 = 8 \\) (rocking chairs),\n   - \\( n_2 = 2 \\) (stools).\n\n4. **Calculate Factorials**: \n   We compute:\n   - \\( 10! = 3628800 \\)\n   - \\( 8! = 40320 \\)\n   - \\( 2! = 2 \\)\n\n5. **Apply the Formula**: \n   Substituting the values into the formula gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of arrangements} = \\frac{10!}{8! \\times 2!} = \\frac{3628800}{40320 \\times 2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Perform the Calculation**: \n   First, calculate \\( 8! \\times 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   40320 \\times 2 = 80640\n   \\]\n   Then, divide:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3628800}{80640} = 45\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThus, the total number of distinct ways to arrange the eight rocking chairs and two stools is 45.\n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>45 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting."
