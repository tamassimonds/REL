  "problem": "How many of the integers between 1 and 1000, inclusive, can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers?\n",
  "solution": "To determine how many integers between 1 and 1000 can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers, we start by representing this mathematically:\n\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\n\\]\n\nThis shows that for an integer \\( n \\) to be expressed as \\( a^2 - b^2 \\), it can be represented as:\n\n\\[\nn = (a - b)(a + b)\n\\]\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n\\[\nx = a - b \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = a + b\n\\]\n\nHence, we have:\n\n\\[\nn = xy\n\\]\n\nBoth \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must be integers with the same parity (both even or both odd) since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers.\n\n### Parity Analysis\n\n1. **Both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are odd**:  \n   In this case, \\( n \\) will be odd since the product of two odd integers is odd.\n   \n2. **Both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are even**:  \n   When both are even, \\( n \\) will be a multiple of 4 (since even \u00d7 even = multiple of 4).\n\n### Valid Integer Identification\n\nFrom this analysis:\n- **All odd integers \\( n \\)** can be represented as the difference of squares, as they can be expressed as \\( n = 1 \\times n \\) where both numbers are odd.\n- **Even integers** must specifically be multiples of 4 to represent the difference of squares.\n\n### Counting Future Integers\n\nTo find the total integers between 1 and 1000 that can be expressed in this way, we count:\n1. Odd integers.\n2. Even integers that are multiples of 4.\n\n#### Counting Odd Integers\n\nThe odd integers between 1 and 1000 form the sequence:\n\n\\[\n1, 3, 5, \\ldots, 999\n\\]\n\nUsing the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence, the count is:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{999 - 1}{2} + 1 = 500\n\\]\n\nSo, there are **500 odd integers**.\n\n#### Counting Even Integers that are Multiples of 4\n\nThe even integers that are multiples of 4 up to 1000 form the sequence:\n\n\\[\n4, 8, 12, \\ldots, 1000\n\\]\n\nCalculating the number of terms gives:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1000 - 4}{4} + 1 = 250\n\\]\n\nThus, there are **250 even integers that are multiples of 4**.\n\n### Final Count\n\nThe total number of integers between 1 and 1000 that can be expressed as the difference of two squares is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = \\text{Number of odd integers} + \\text{Number of even integers (multiple of 4)} = 500 + 250 = 750\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUltimately, the total number of integers between 1 and 1000 that can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers is:\n\n<ANSWER>750</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Notice that all odd numbers can be obtained by using $(a+1)^2-a^2=2a+1,$ where $a$ is a nonnegative integer. All multiples of $4$ can be obtained by using $(b+1)^2-(b-1)^2 = 4b$, where $b$ is a positive integer. Numbers congruent to $2 \\pmod 4$ cannot be obtained because squares are $0, 1 \\pmod 4.$ Thus, the answer is $500+250 = \\boxed{750}.$"
