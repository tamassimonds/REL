  "problem": "How many even perfect square factors does $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ have?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of even perfect square factors of the number \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^9\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Perfect Square Characteristics\nA perfect square factor requires all even exponents in its prime factorization. Additionally, since we are looking for even perfect square factors, the factor must include the prime number \\(2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Factor Form Representation\nThe perfect square factor can be expressed in the form \\(2^a \\cdot 7^b\\), where both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are even integers.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Possible Values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\n- **For \\(2^4\\)**: The even values for \\(a\\) that do not exceed 4 are \\(0, 2, 4\\). Thus, we have three possible values: \\(0, 2, 4\\).\n- **For \\(7^9\\)**: The even values for \\(b\\) that do not exceed 9 are \\(0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\). This gives us five possible values: \\(0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\).\n\n### Step 4: Restricting \\(a\\) for Even Factors\nTo ensure the factor is even, \\(a\\) must be at least \\(2\\). Therefore, the possible values for \\(a\\) are reduced to \\(2\\) and \\(4\\), resulting in two valid options.\n\n### Step 5: Combine Options for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nNow we can calculate the possible combinations:\n- Options for \\(a\\): \\(2\\) and \\(4\\) (2 choices).\n- Options for \\(b\\): \\(0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\) (5 choices).\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Total Even Perfect Square Factors\nThe total number of even perfect square factors is obtained by multiplying the number of choices for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Total Even Perfect Square Factors} = \\text{Choices for } a \\times \\text{Choices for } b = 2 \\times 5 = 10\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the total number of even perfect square factors of \\(2^4 \\cdot 7^9\\) is \\( \\boxed{10} \\).",
  "ground_truth": "A positive integer is a factor of $2^4\\cdot7^9$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 7^b$ for exponents $a$ and $b$ satisfying $0\\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 9$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  A positive integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we may choose $a=2$ or $4$ and $b=0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ or $8.$  Since we have 2 choices for $a$ and 5 choices for $b$, there are $2\\times5=\\boxed{10}$ ways to make these two decisions."
