  "problem": "A baseball league has nine teams. During the season, each of the nine teams plays exactly three games with each of the other teams. What is the total number of games played?",
  "solution": "To determine the total number of games played in the league with 9 teams, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Team Overview**: There are 9 teams in the league.\n\n2. **Matchups**: Each team competes against every other team. With 9 teams, each team faces 8 opponents (9 - 1 = 8).\n\n3. **Games Played by Each Team**: Each team plays 3 games against each of the 8 other teams. This results in:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Games per team} = 3 \\times 8 = 24\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Game Instances**: Since there are 9 teams, the total number of game instances (counting each game from both teams\u2019 perspectives) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total instances} = 9 \\times 24 = 216\n   \\]\n\n5. **Adjust for Double Counting**: Each game is counted twice (once for each participating team), so we divide the total game instances by 2 to find the number of unique games:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total unique games} = \\frac{216}{2} = 108\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the **total number of games played in the league is** <ANSWER>108</ANSWER>.",
  "ground_truth": "Suppose each team played just one game with each of the remaining teams. Then each of the nine teams plays eight games. This makes a total of $9 \\times 8$ or 72 games. However each game has been counted twice in this total. For example, the game between Team A and Team B appears in A's 8 games and also B's 8 games. Therefore there are $9 \\times \\frac{8}{2} = 36$ different games played. Since each game is played three times, the total number of games played is $3 \\times 36 = \\boxed{108}$."
