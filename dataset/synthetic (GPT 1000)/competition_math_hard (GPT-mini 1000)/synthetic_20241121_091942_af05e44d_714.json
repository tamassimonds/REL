  "solution": "To determine the average speed of Sam's car from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m., we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Time Interval:**\n   - The duration from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 5 hours.\n\n2. **Assess the Total Distance Traveled:**\n   - According to the graph, Sam's starting distance at 6 a.m. is 0 miles, and by 11 a.m., it reaches 160 miles. \n   - Thus, the total distance covered is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Distance} = 160 \\text{ miles} - 0 \\text{ miles} = 160 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Compute the Average Speed:**\n   - Average speed is calculated as total distance divided by total time. The formula is:\n     \\[\n     v = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the values, we find:\n     \\[\n     v = \\frac{160 \\text{ miles}}{5 \\text{ hours}} = 32 \\text{ miles per hour}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the average speed of Sam's car from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Speed} = 32 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n<ANSWER> 32 miles per hour </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since he traveled 160 miles in 5 hours, his speed measured in miles per hour is $\\frac{160}{5} = \\boxed{32}$."
