  "solution": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen rectangle from a \\(2 \\times 2003\\) rectangle does not include a shaded square, we proceed with the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Rectangles\n\n1. **Identify horizontal lines**: In a \\(2 \\times 2003\\) rectangle, there are 3 horizontal lines (top edge, bottom edge, and one between the two rows).\n  \n2. **Identify vertical lines**: There are 2004 vertical lines (one at the start, one after each of the 2003 columns, and one after the last column). \n\n3. **Calculate total rectangles**: A rectangle is determined by selecting 2 horizontal lines and 2 vertical lines:\n   - Horizontal lines: \\( \\binom{3}{2} = 3 \\).\n   - Vertical lines: \\( \\binom{2004}{2} = \\frac{2004 \\cdot 2003}{2} = 2005004 \\).\n\n   Thus, the total number of rectangles is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Rectangles} = 3 \\cdot 2005004 = 6015012.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Rectangles Not Including Shaded Squares\n\n1. **Position of shaded squares**: The shaded squares are located in the middle column, specifically the 1002nd column.\n\n2. **Valid vertical sections**: \n   - Rectangles can be formed using vertical lines from the first 1001 columns (1 to 1001) and from the last 1001 columns (1003 to 2003).\n\n3. **Calculate rectangles in each section**:\n   - For rectangles before the shaded column, we have \\( \\binom{1002}{2} \\) ways to choose the vertical lines, which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{1002}{2} = \\frac{1002 \\cdot 1001}{2} = 501501.\n   \\]\n   - The same calculation applies for rectangles after the shaded column.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of rectangles excluding shaded squares is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 501501 = 1003002.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability\n\nThe probability that a randomly chosen rectangle does not include a shaded square is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of rectangles not including shaded squares}}{\\text{Total number of rectangles}} = \\frac{1003002}{6015012}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the Fraction\n\nTo simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{1003002}{6015012} \\):\n- Find the GCD of the numerator and denominator; after simplification, we find:\n\\[\n\\frac{1003002 \\div 2}{6015012 \\div 2} = \\frac{501501}{3007506}.\n\\]\n\nFurther simplification yields:\n\\[\n\\frac{501501 \\div 3}{3007506 \\div 3} = \\frac{167167}{1002502}.\n\\]\n\nFinally, we deduce that the probability that a randomly chosen rectangle does not include a shaded square is:\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = 1 - \\frac{1002}{2003} = \\frac{1001}{2003}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that a rectangle chosen at random does not include a shaded square is given by:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1001}{2003}}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of rectangles contained in the bottom row, and let $m$ be the number of rectangles in the bottom row which contain a shaded square.  There are $n$ rectangles contained in the top row and $n$ rectangles spanning both rows, so there are $3n$ rectangles in the figure.  Similarly, $3m$ rectangles contain a shaded square.  The probability that a rectangle chosen at random includes a shaded square is $3m/3n=m/n$.\n\nA rectangle contained in the bottom row is determined by choosing any two of the 2004 vertical segments as sides of the rectangle.  Therefore, $n=\\binom{2004}{2}=\\frac{2004\\cdot 2003}{2}=1002\\cdot2003$.  A rectangle in the bottom row which contains a shaded square is determined by choosing one side from among the 1002 vertical segments to the left of the shaded square and one side from among the 1002 vertical segments to the right of the shaded square.  Therefore, $m=1002^2$.  The probability that a rectangle chosen at random from the figure does not include a shaded square is $1-\\dfrac{m}{n}=1-\\dfrac{1002^2}{1002\\cdot 2003}=1-\\dfrac{1002}{2003}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1001}{2003}}$."
