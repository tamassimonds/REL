  "problem": "When the digits in the number $2005$ are reversed we obtain the number $5002,$ and $5002 = a \\cdot b \\cdot c$, such that $a$, $b$ and $c$ are three distinct primes. How many other positive integers are the products of exactly three distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ such that $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = a+b+c$?",
  "solution": "To determine how many products of exactly three distinct primes \\(p_1\\), \\(p_2\\), and \\(p_3\\) satisfy the condition \\(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = a + b + c\\), we begin by identifying the distinct prime factors of \\(5002\\).\n\n### Step 1: Factor 5002\nThe prime factorization of \\(5002\\) is:\n\\[\n5002 = 2 \\times 41 \\times 61\n\\]\nThis gives us the distinct primes:\n- \\(a = 2\\)\n- \\(b = 41\\)\n- \\(c = 61\\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Sum of the Primes\nNext, we compute their sum:\n\\[\na + b + c = 2 + 41 + 61 = 104\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find Distinct Primes That Sum to 104\nWe now seek distinct primes \\(p_1\\), \\(p_2\\), and \\(p_3\\) such that:\n\\[\np_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 104\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Search for Prime Triplets\nTo find valid combinations of three distinct primes that sum to \\(104\\):\n1. Start with the smallest prime, \\(2\\):\n   - Set \\(p_1 = 2\\), which means \\(p_2 + p_3 = 102\\).\n  \n2. List the primes less than \\(102\\):\n   Relevant primes include: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.\n\n3. Identify pairs of primes:\n   For each prime \\(p_2\\) in our list, calculate \\(p_3 = 102 - p_2\\) and check if \\(p_3\\) is also prime:\n   - Possible valid combinations (after checking) include:\n     - \\( (2, 5, 97) \\)\n     - \\( (2, 13, 89) \\)\n     - \\( (2, 19, 83) \\)\n     - \\( (2, 23, 79) \\)\n     - \\( (2, 29, 73) \\)\n     - \\( (2, 31, 71) \\)\n     - \\( (2, 43, 59) \\)\n\n### Step 5: Count Valid Triples\nWe find a total of **7 distinct triples** of primes that satisfy the equation \\(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 104\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the solution is:\n<ANSWER> 7 distinct integers</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "5002 factors to $2 \\cdot 41 \\cdot 61$, which sums to 104.  Since 2 is the only even prime number, and we need the sum of these 3 distinct primes to be even, 2 must be one of these primes, meaning we need to look at pairs of primes that sum to 102.  We start with 3, subtract that from 102, and see if the resulting number is prime.  We need check only primes up to 51 in this manner because if the prime is greater than 51, its corresponding prime would be less than 51, meaning we would have found the pair already.  In this manner, we find the following 7 different pairs: $(5,97);(13,89);(19,83);(23,79);(29,73);(31,71);(43,59)$, and thus, there are $\\boxed{7 \\text{ distinct integers}}$."
