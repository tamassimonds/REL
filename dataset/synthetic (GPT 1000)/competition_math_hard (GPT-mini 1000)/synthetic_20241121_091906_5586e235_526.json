  "solution": "To determine the number of triangles with positive area whose vertices are points in the \\(xy\\)-plane with integer coordinates \\((x,y)\\) within the square defined by \\(1 \\leq x \\leq 4\\) and \\(1 \\leq y \\leq 4\\), we can follow these structured steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Points\nWe first count the integer coordinate points within the \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid, which are:\n\n\\[\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\\]\n\nThis results in a total of \\(16\\) points.\n\n### Step 2: Total Triangle Combinations\nNext, to find the total number of triangles that can be formed by selecting any 3 points from these 16, we use the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{16}{3} = \\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 560\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Excluding Collinear Points\nWe must exclude combinations of points that are collinear since they do not form valid triangles.\n\n#### Collinear Configurations:\n1. **Horizontal Lines:**\n   Each of the 4 rows allows us to choose 3 points:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{3} = 4 \\quad \\text{(for each row)}\n   \\]\n\n   Multiplying by the number of rows (4):\n\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 4 = 16\n   \\]\n\n2. **Vertical Lines:**\n   The counting follows the same logic for the 4 columns:\n\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 4 = 16\n   \\]\n\n3. **Diagonal Lines:**\n   - **Diagonals with slope 1:**\n     - The main diagonal from \\((1,1)\\) to \\((4,4)\\) (4 points):\n\n     \\[\n     \\binom{4}{3} = 4\n     \\]\n\n     - The two shorter diagonals (\\((2,1)\\) to \\((4,3)\\) and \\((1,2)\\) to \\((3,4)\\)), each with 3 points:\n\n     \\[\n     \\binom{3}{3} = 1 \\quad \\text{(each)}\n     \\]\n\n     Therefore, the total for slope 1 is:\n\n     \\[\n     4 + 1 + 1 = 6\n     \\]\n\n   - **Diagonals with slope -1:**\n     - The main diagonal from \\((1,4)\\) to \\((4,1)\\) (4 points):\n\n     \\[\n     \\binom{4}{3} = 4\n     \\]\n\n     - The two shorter diagonals (\\((2,4)\\) to \\((4,2)\\) and \\((1,3)\\) to \\((3,1)\\)), also with 3 points:\n\n     \\[\n     \\binom{3}{3} = 1 \\quad \\text{(each)}\n     \\]\n\n     Thus, the total for slope -1 is:\n\n     \\[\n     4 + 1 + 1 = 6\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Total Collinear Combinations\nNow, we summarize the total number of collinear combinations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Collinear} = 16 \\text{ (horizontal)} + 16 \\text{ (vertical)} + 6 \\text{ (slope 1)} + 6 \\text{ (slope -1)} = 44\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculating Valid Triangles\nFinally, we find the number of valid triangles by subtracting the collinear combinations from the total combinations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Valid Triangles} = \\binom{16}{3} - \\text{Total Collinear} = 560 - 44 = 516\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of triangles with positive area is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{516}\n\\] \n\nThis conclusion matches option (D) from the given options.",
  "ground_truth": "The vertices of the triangles are limited to a $4\\times4$ grid, with $16$ points total. Every triangle is determined by $3$ points chosen from these $16$ for a total of $\\binom{16}{3}=560$. However, triangles formed by collinear points do not have positive area. For each column or row, there are $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ such degenerate triangles. There are $8$ total columns and rows, contributing $32$ invalid triangles. There are also $4$ for both of the diagonals and $1$ for each of the $4$ shorter diagonals. There are a total of $32+8+4=44$ invalid triangles counted in the $560$, so the answer is $560-44=\\boxed{516}$."
