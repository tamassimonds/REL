  "problem": "Christine must buy at least $45$ fluid ounces of milk at the store. The store only sells milk in $200$ milliliter bottles. If there are $33.8$ fluid ounces in $1$ liter, then what is the smallest number of bottles that Christine could buy?  (You may use a calculator on this problem.)",
  "solution": "To determine how many bottles of milk Christine needs to buy to obtain at least 45 fluid ounces, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Convert Fluid Ounces to Milliliters\nWe start by converting the required volume from fluid ounces to milliliters. We know that 1 liter is equivalent to 33.8 fluid ounces, and 1 liter equals 1000 milliliters. \n\nFirst, we calculate how many liters are needed for 45 fluid ounces:\n\n\\[\n\\text{liters} = \\frac{45 \\text{ fluid ounces}}{33.8 \\text{ fluid ounces per liter}} \\approx 1.3275 \\text{ liters}\n\\]\n\nNext, we convert liters to milliliters:\n\n\\[\n\\text{milliliters} = 1.3275 \\text{ liters} \\times 1000 \\text{ milliliters per liter} \\approx 1327.5 \\text{ milliliters}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Bottles Needed\nEach bottle of milk contains 200 milliliters. To find out how many bottles Christine needs, we perform the following calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of bottles} = \\frac{1327.5 \\text{ milliliters}}{200 \\text{ milliliters per bottle}} = 6.6375\n\\]\n\nSince Christine cannot purchase a fraction of a bottle, we round this up to the nearest whole number:\n\n\\[\n\\text{number of bottles} = 7\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the smallest number of bottles Christine needs to buy to ensure she has at least 45 fluid ounces of milk is **7**.",
  "ground_truth": "First we convert the amount of milk Christine must buy from ounces to liters. We use the conversion factor $\\frac{1\\ \\text{L}}{33.8\\ \\text{fl.oz}}$ to obtain $45\\ \\text{fl.oz} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{L}}{33.8\\ \\text{fl.oz}} \\approx 1.331\\ \\text{L}$. There are $1000\\ \\text{mL}$ in one liter, and $\\frac{1331}{200} \\approx 6.657$, so Christine must buy at least $\\boxed{7}$ bottles of milk at the store."
