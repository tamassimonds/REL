  "problem": "Two concentric circles with radii of 19 and 29 units bound a shaded region. A third circle will be drawn with area equal to that of the shaded area. What must the radius of the third circle be? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\n[asy]\nfilldraw(circle((0,0),29),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((0,0),19),white);\n\ndot((0,0));\n\ndraw((0,0)--19dir(45),linewidth(1));\n\nlabel(\"19\",9.5dir(45),NW);\n[/asy]",
  "solution": "To find the radius of a third circle whose area matches the shaded region between two concentric circles, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Area of the Larger Circle\nThe radius of the larger circle is 29 units. The area \\(A_L\\) of a circle is calculated as:\n\\[\nA_L = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\times (29^2) = \\pi \\times 841 = 841\\pi\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Smaller Circle\nThe radius of the smaller circle is 19 units. Using the same formula, the area \\(A_S\\) is:\n\\[\nA_S = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\times (19^2) = \\pi \\times 361 = 361\\pi\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Area of the Shaded Region\nThe shaded area \\(A_{\\text{shaded}}\\) between the two circles is found by subtracting the area of the smaller circle from that of the larger circle:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{shaded}} = A_L - A_S = 841\\pi - 361\\pi = 480\\pi\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Set Up the Equation for the Third Circle\nWe want the area of a third circle to equal the shaded area. The area of the third circle is given by:\n\\[\n\\pi r^2 = 480\\pi\n\\]\nDividing each side by \\(\\pi\\):\n\\[\nr^2 = 480\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve for the Radius\nTo find the radius \\(r\\), take the square root:\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{480}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplify \\(\\sqrt{480}\\)\nBreaking down 480 gives:\n\\[\n480 = 16 \\times 30\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\n\\sqrt{480} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 30} = \\sqrt{16} \\times \\sqrt{30} = 4\\sqrt{30}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe radius of the third circle that has the same area as the shaded region is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4\\sqrt{30}}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Since the shaded region is everything inside the larger circle but outside the smaller, its area is $29^2 \\pi - 19^2\\pi = 480\\pi$.  So, letting the radius of the third circle be $r$, we have $\\pi r^2 = 480 \\pi$, or $r = \\sqrt{480} = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{30}}$."
