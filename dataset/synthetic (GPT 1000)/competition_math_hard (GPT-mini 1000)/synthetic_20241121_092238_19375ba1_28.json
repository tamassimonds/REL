  "problem": "Suppose the function $f$ has all real numbers in its domain and range and is invertible. Some values of $f$ are given by the following table: $$\\begin{array}{c || c | c | c | c | c}\nx & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n\\hline\nf(x) & 2 & 3 & 5 & 7 & 8\n\\end{array}$$What is the value of $f(f(3)) + f(f^{-1}(4)) + f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5))?$ If there is not enough information to answer this question, enter \"NEI\".",
  "solution": "Let's evaluate the expression \\( f(f(3)) + f(f^{-1}(4)) + f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) \\) step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate \\( f(f(3)) \\)\n\nFirst, we need to find \\( f(3) \\). Referring to the provided table:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c || c | c | c | c | c}\nx & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n\\hline\nf(x) & 2 & 3 & 5 & 7 & 8\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nFrom the table, we see that \\( f(3) = 5 \\). Next, we need to compute \\( f(f(3)) \\), which means finding \\( f(5) \\).\n\nLooking again at the table, we find \\( f(5) = 8 \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\nf(f(3)) = 8.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate \\( f(f^{-1}(4)) \\)\n\nNext, we need \\( f^{-1}(4) \\), which is the value of \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 4 \\). However, inspecting the table reveals that \\( 4 \\) is not a value in the output of \\( f(x) \\) for any \\( x \\) in the table. Therefore, \\( f^{-1}(4) \\) does not exist.\n\nDespite this, we can use the property of inverse functions to state that:\n\n\\[\nf(f^{-1}(4)) = 4.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate \\( f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) \\)\n\nNow we will find \\( f^{-1}(5) \\). We look for \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 5 \\). From the table, we see:\n\n- \\( f(3) = 5 \\).\n\nThus, \\( f^{-1}(5) = 3 \\). Next, we need to compute \\( f^{-1}(3) \\), which requires finding \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 3 \\). Looking up the table, we find:\n\n- \\( f(2) = 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, we have \\( f^{-1}(3) = 2 \\). Putting this together, we find:\n\n\\[\nf^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) = f^{-1}(3) = 2.\n\\]\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nNow we can combine all our results:\n\n\\[\nf(f(3)) + f(f^{-1}(4)) + f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) = 8 + 4 + 2.\n\\]\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\n\\[\n8 + 4 + 2 = 14.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>14</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Reading the table, we see that $f(f(3)) = f(5) = 8.$\n\nAlthough we can't look up $f^{-1}(4)$ in the table, we know that $f(f^{-1}(4)) = 4,$ since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ for all $x$ (by the definition of an inverse function).\n\nSince $f(3) = 5,$ we have $f^{-1}(5) = 3,$ and so $$f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) = f^{-1}(3).$$Then, since $f(2) = 3,$ we have $$f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) = f^{-1}(3) = 2.$$Combining the information above, we get $$f(f(3)) + f(f^{-1}(4)) + f^{-1}(f^{-1}(5)) = 8+4+2 = \\boxed{14}.$$"
