  "problem": "Joe and JoAnn each bought 12 ounces of coffee in a 16-ounce  cup. Joe drank 2 ounces  of his coffee and then added 2 ounces  of cream. JoAnn added 2 ounces  of cream, stirred the coffee well, and then drank 2 ounces. What is the resulting ratio of the amount of cream in Joe's coffee to that in JoAnn's coffee? Express your answer as a fraction.",
  "solution": "To determine the ratio of the amount of cream in Joe's coffee compared to JoAnn's coffee, we can follow these clear steps:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Joe's Coffee\n1. **Initial Coffee**: Joe starts with 12 ounces of coffee.\n2. **Coffee Consumed**: After drinking 2 ounces, he has:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ ounces} - 2 \\text{ ounces} = 10 \\text{ ounces of coffee.}\n   \\]\n3. **Adding Cream**: Joe adds 2 ounces of cream, totaling:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ ounces of coffee} + 2 \\text{ ounces of cream} = 12 \\text{ ounces total.}\n   \\]\n4. **Cream Amount**: Therefore, the total amount of cream in Joe's coffee is 2 ounces.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze JoAnn's Coffee\n1. **Initial Coffee**: JoAnn also starts with 12 ounces of coffee.\n2. **Adding Cream**: JoAnn adds 2 ounces of cream directly, creating a total of:\n   \\[\n   12 \\text{ ounces of coffee} + 2 \\text{ ounces of cream} = 14 \\text{ ounces total.}\n   \\]\n3. **Mixing**: After stirring, the cream is evenly distributed throughout the 14 ounces. The ratio of cream to the total volume is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2 \\text{ ounces of cream}}{14 \\text{ ounces total}} = \\frac{1}{7}.\n   \\]\n4. **Coffee Consumed**: JoAnn then drinks 2 ounces of the mixture. The amount of cream in those 2 ounces is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ ounces} \\times \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{2}{7} \\text{ ounces of cream.}\n   \\]\n5. **Remaining Cream**: After drinking, the amount of cream left in JoAnn's coffee is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ ounces of cream} - \\frac{2}{7} \\text{ ounces} = \\frac{14}{7} - \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{12}{7} \\text{ ounces of cream.}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio\nWe can now compute the ratio of cream in Joe's coffee to that in JoAnn's coffee:\n- Joe has 2 ounces of cream.\n- JoAnn has \\(\\frac{12}{7}\\) ounces of cream.\n\nThe ratio is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Joe's cream}}{\\text{JoAnn's cream}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{12}{7}}.\n\\]\n\nTo simplify this, we multiply by the reciprocal:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{\\frac{12}{7}} = 2 \\times \\frac{7}{12} = \\frac{14}{12}.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{14}{12} = \\frac{7}{6}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the ratio of the amount of cream in Joe's coffee to the amount in JoAnn's coffee is:\n<ANSWER>\\(\\frac{7}{6}\\)</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Joe has 2 ounces  of cream in his cup. JoAnn has drunk 2 ounces  of the 14 ounces  of coffee-cream mixture in her cup, so she has only $12/14 = 6/7$ of her 2 ounces  of cream in her cup. Therefore the ratio of the amount of cream in Joe's coffee to that in JoAnn's coffee is \\[\n\\frac{2}{\\frac{6}{7}\\cdot2} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{6}}.\n\\]"
