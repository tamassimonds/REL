  "problem": "A bin has 8 black balls and 7 white balls.  3 of the balls are drawn at random.  What is the probability of drawing 2 of one color and 1 of the other color?",
  "solution": "To find the probability of drawing 2 balls of one color and 1 ball of another color from a bin with 8 black balls and 7 white balls, we can summarize the solution as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Balls\nFirst, we calculate the total number of balls:\n\\[\n8 \\text{ (black)} + 7 \\text{ (white)} = 15 \\text{ balls}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Total Ways to Draw 3 Balls\nNext, we determine the total number of ways to choose 3 balls from 15, which is computed using the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{15}{3} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 455\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Ways to Draw 2 Balls of One Color and 1 of the Other Color\nThere are two scenarios to consider:\n\n#### Scenario 1: Drawing 2 Black Balls and 1 White Ball\n- Ways to choose 2 black balls from 8:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28\n\\]\n- Ways to choose 1 white ball from 7:\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{1} = 7\n\\]\n- Total for this scenario:\n\\[\n28 \\times 7 = 196\n\\]\n\n#### Scenario 2: Drawing 2 White Balls and 1 Black Ball\n- Ways to choose 2 white balls from 7:\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n\\]\n- Ways to choose 1 black ball from 8:\n\\[\n\\binom{8}{1} = 8\n\\]\n- Total for this scenario:\n\\[\n21 \\times 8 = 168\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Total Ways to Get 2 Balls of One Color and 1 of Another\nCombining both scenarios:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Ways} = 196 + 168 = 364\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Probability\nThe probability of drawing 2 balls of one color and 1 of the other color is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total outcomes:\n\\[\nP(\\text{2 of one color and 1 of another}) = \\frac{364}{455}\n\\]\n\n### Final Simplification\nBoth numbers can be simplified by dividing by their greatest common divisor, which is 91:\n\\[\n\\frac{364 \\div 91}{455 \\div 91} = \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the probability of drawing 2 balls of one color and 1 ball of the other color is:\n\\[\n\\text{Final Answer: } \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The number of ways to draw out 3 balls from 15 is $\\binom{15}{3}=455$.  We can choose 2 black balls and 1 white ball in $\\binom{8}{2}\\binom{7}{1}=196$ ways.  We can pick 1 black ball and 2 white balls in $\\binom{8}{1}\\binom{7}{2}=168$ ways.  Therefore we have $196+168=364$ ways to satisfy the condition, so the answer is $\\dfrac{364}{455}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$."
