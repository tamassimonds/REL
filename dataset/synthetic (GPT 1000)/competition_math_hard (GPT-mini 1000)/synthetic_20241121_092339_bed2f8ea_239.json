  "solution": "To determine the maximum number of non-constant polynomial factors of the polynomial \\(x^8 - 1\\) with real coefficients, we proceed through a systematic factorization.\n\n1. **Initial Factorization**:\n   We start with the polynomial:\n   \\[\n   x^8 - 1 = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Factoring \\(x^4 - 1\\)**:\n   The term \\(x^4 - 1\\) is a difference of squares:\n   \\[\n   x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\n   \\]\n   We can factor \\(x^2 - 1\\) further:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\n   \\]\n   Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   x^4 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the Factors**:\n   Including the previously identified factor of \\(x^4 + 1\\), we write:\n   \\[\n   x^8 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 1)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Factoring \\(x^4 + 1\\)**:\n   Next, we analyze \\(x^4 + 1\\). This can be transformed using the identity:\n   \\[\n   x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + 1)^2 - (x\\sqrt{2})^2\n   \\]\n   Applying the difference of squares:\n   \\[\n   x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + x\\sqrt{2} + 1)(x^2 - x\\sqrt{2} + 1)\n   \\]\n   Both factors are quadratic polynomials and do not factor further over the reals, as confirmed by their negative discriminants.\n\n5. **Counting Non-Constant Factors**:\n   We now tally the distinct non-constant polynomial factors:\n   - From \\(x^2 - 1\\): \\(x - 1\\) and \\(x + 1\\) (2 factors).\n   - From \\(x^2 + 1\\): 1 factor.\n   - From \\(x^4 + 1\\): Two factors, \\( (x^2 + x\\sqrt{2} + 1) \\) and \\( (x^2 - x\\sqrt{2} + 1) \\).\n\nThus, the total number of distinct non-constant polynomial factors of \\(x^8 - 1\\) is:\n\\[\nk = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of non-constant polynomial factors of \\(x^8 - 1\\) with real coefficients is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "By applying the difference of squares factorization repeatedly, we get\n\\begin{align*}\nx^8 - 1 &= (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 1) \\\\\n&= (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 1) \\\\\n&= (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 1).\n\\end{align*}We can factor $x^4 + 1$ further with a clever application of difference-of-squares:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^4 + 1 &= x^4 + 2x^2 + 1 - 2x^2 \\\\\n&= (x^2 + 1)^2 - (x \\sqrt{2})^2 \\\\\n&= (x^2 + x \\sqrt{2} + 1)(x^2 - x \\sqrt{2} + 1).\n\\end{align*}Thus,\n\\[x^8 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + x \\sqrt{2} + 1)(x^2 - x \\sqrt{2} + 1).\\]The quadratic factors have no real roots, so the factorization can have at most $\\boxed{5}$ factors."
