  "solution": "To determine how many integers between 300 and 500 have digits that sum to 16, we proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Range\nThe integers we are considering range from 300 to 500. They can be represented in the form:\n- \\( ABC \\), where:\n  - \\( A = 3 \\) or \\( A = 4 \\) (hundreds digit)\n  - \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) can each take values from 0 to 9 (tens and units digits, respectively)\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Equations\nWe need the sum of the digits \\( A + B + C = 16 \\). This leads to two cases based on the value of \\( A \\):\n- If \\( A = 3 \\):\n  \\[\n  3 + B + C = 16 \\implies B + C = 13\n  \\]\n- If \\( A = 4 \\):\n  \\[\n  4 + B + C = 16 \\implies B + C = 12\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve Each Case\n\n#### Case 1: \\( A = 3 \\) (thus \\( B + C = 13 \\))\nWe need to find pairs of digits \\( (B, C) \\) where their sum equals 13:\n- \\( B = 4 \\), \\( C = 9 \\) \u2192 349\n- \\( B = 5 \\), \\( C = 8 \\) \u2192 358\n- \\( B = 6 \\), \\( C = 7 \\) \u2192 367\n- \\( B = 7 \\), \\( C = 6 \\) \u2192 376\n- \\( B = 8 \\), \\( C = 5 \\) \u2192 385\n- \\( B = 9 \\), \\( C = 4 \\) \u2192 394\n\nThus, the valid integers for \\( A = 3 \\) are **349, 358, 367, 376, 385, 394**, resulting in **6 integers**.\n\n#### Case 2: \\( A = 4 \\) (thus \\( B + C = 12 \\))\nNow we find pairs \\( (B, C) \\) where their sum equals 12:\n- \\( B = 3 \\), \\( C = 9 \\) \u2192 439\n- \\( B = 4 \\), \\( C = 8 \\) \u2192 448\n- \\( B = 5 \\), \\( C = 7 \\) \u2192 457\n- \\( B = 6 \\), \\( C = 6 \\) \u2192 466\n- \\( B = 7 \\), \\( C = 5 \\) \u2192 475\n- \\( B = 8 \\), \\( C = 4 \\) \u2192 484\n- \\( B = 9 \\), \\( C = 3 \\) \u2192 493\n\nThus, the valid integers for \\( A = 4 \\) are **439, 448, 457, 466, 475, 484, 493**, which totals **7 integers**.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Results\nWe now combine the results from both cases:\n- **Case 1 (A = 3)** gives us 6 integers.\n- **Case 2 (A = 4)** gives us 7 integers.\n\nHence, the total number of integers between 300 and 500 with a digit sum of 16 is:\n\\[\n6 + 7 = 13\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe total count of integers between 300 and 500 whose digits sum to 16 is **13**.",
  "ground_truth": "We have to consider 2 cases:\n\nWhen the hundreds digit is 3, we want the sum of the tens and unit digit equal to 13. We have $4+9=5+8=6+7=13,$ which yield a total of 6 choices (two for each pair that adds to 13).\n\nWhen the hundreds digit is 4, we want the sum of the tens and unit digit equal to 12. We have $3+9=4+8=5+7=6+6=12.$ The first three pairs give us 2 solutions, but the last only gives 1, so we have a total of 7 choices.\n\nTherefore there are total of $6+7= \\boxed{13}$ integers."
