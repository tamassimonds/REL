  "problem": "Two years ago there were 20 trailer homes on Elm Street with an average age of 18 years. At that time, a group of brand new trailer homes was then added to Elm Street. Today, the average age of all the trailer homes on Elm Street is 14 years. How many new trailer homes were added two years ago?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of determining how many new trailer homes were added two years ago, we will follow a systematic approach using the given information.\n\n1. **Information Two Years Ago**:\n   - At that time, there were 20 trailer homes, each with an average age of 18 years.\n\n2. **Total Age of Trailer Homes Two Years Ago**:\n   To find the total age of the trailer homes, we multiply the number of homes by their average age:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Age} = 20 \\times 18 = 360 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Age of Existing Homes Today**:\n   Since two years have passed, each of the original homes has aged an additional 2 years. Thus, the total age of these homes today is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Age Today} = 360 + (20 \\times 2) = 360 + 40 = 400 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Introducing New Trailer Homes**:\n   Let \\(x\\) represent the number of new trailer homes added. These new homes would be 2 years old today, giving their total age as \\(2x\\).\n\n5. **Total Number of Homes Today**:\n   The total number of trailer homes today is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Trailer Homes Today} = 20 + x\n   \\]\n\n6. **Average Age of All Trailer Homes Today**:\n   The problem states that the average age of all trailer homes today is 14 years. We can set up the equation for average age:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Age} = \\frac{\\text{Total Age of All Homes}}{\\text{Total Number of Homes}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values gives:\n   \\[\n   14 = \\frac{400 + 2x}{20 + x}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Solving for \\(x\\)**:\n   To eliminate the fraction, we cross-multiply:\n   \\[\n   14(20 + x) = 400 + 2x\n   \\]\n   Expanding the left side:\n   \\[\n   280 + 14x = 400 + 2x\n   \\]\n\n8. **Rearranging the Equation**:\n   Next, we consolidate terms to solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   14x - 2x = 400 - 280\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   12x = 120\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 12 yields:\n   \\[\n   x = 10\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of new trailer homes added two years ago is **10**.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n<ANSWER>10 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The 20 original trailers are now an average of 20 years old, and the $n$ new trailers are all 2 years old.  There are $20+n$ trailers, and the sum of their ages is $20\\cdot20+2n$.  This gives us the equation  \\[\n\\frac{400+2n}{20+n}=14,\n\\] which we solve like this: \\begin{align*}\n400+2n &= 14(20+n) \\\\\n400+2n &= 280+14n \\\\\n120 &= 12n\n\\end{align*} We find that there are $n=\\boxed{10}$ new trailer homes."
