  "problem": "A line through the points $(2, -9)$ and $(j, 17)$ is parallel to the line $2x + 3y = 21$. What is the value of $j$?",
  "solution": "To find the value of \\( j \\) such that the line through the points \\( (2, -9) \\) and \\( (j, 17) \\) is parallel to the line defined by the equation \\( 2x + 3y = 21 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the slope of the given line**: We start by rewriting the equation \\( 2x + 3y = 21 \\) in slope-intercept form \\( y = mx + b \\):\n   \\[\n   3y = -2x + 21 \\implies y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 7\n   \\]\n   The slope \\( m \\) of this line is \\( -\\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n2. **Understand the property of parallel lines**: Lines that are parallel have the same slope. Hence, the slope of the line passing through the points \\( (2, -9) \\) and \\( (j, 17) \\) must also be \\( -\\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the slope of the line through the two points**: The slope \\( m \\) between the points \\( (2, -9) \\) and \\( (j, 17) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{17 - (-9)}{j - 2} = \\frac{26}{j - 2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Equate the slopes**: Setting the slopes equal since the lines are parallel gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{26}{j - 2} = -\\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Cross-multiply and simplify**:\n   \\[\n   26 \\cdot 3 = -2 \\cdot (j - 2) \\implies 78 = -2j + 4\n   \\]\n\n6. **Rearrange to solve for \\( j \\)**:\n   \\[\n   78 - 4 = -2j \\implies 74 = -2j \\implies j = -\\frac{74}{2} = -37\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the required value of \\( j \\) is:\n\\[\n\\text{<ANSWER> -37 </ANSWER>}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The slope of the given line is $-\\frac23$, and the line through the points must have the same slope. This means that \\[\n\\frac{17-(-9)}{j-2}=-\\frac23\n\\] We can multiply out denominators to get $3(26)=-2(j-2)$, or $-39=j-2$ and $j=\\boxed{-37}$."
