  "solution": "To determine the number of equilateral triangles that can be formed with vertices in a hexagonal lattice, we will analyze its geometric properties and the potential positions for the triangle's vertices.\n\n### Understanding the Hexagonal Lattice\nIn a hexagonal lattice:\n- Points are arranged such that each point has six equidistant neighbors, spaced at 60-degree angles.\n- This arrangement allows for various combinations of vertices for forming triangles.\n\n### Triangles with Side Length of One\nThe simplest equilateral triangles to consider have side lengths of 1 unit, matching the distance to the nearest neighbors.\n\nTaking the origin point (0,0) as an example, its direct neighbors are:\n- (1, 0) \u2014 right\n- (1/2, \u221a3/2) \u2014 upper right\n- (-1/2, \u221a3/2) \u2014 upper left\n- (-1, 0) \u2014 left\n- (-1/2, -\u221a3/2) \u2014 lower left\n- (1/2, -\u221a3/2) \u2014 lower right\n\n### Finding All Possible Equilateral Triangles\nBy using the origin and its neighboring points, we can form several distinct equilateral triangles:\n1. Triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0), (1/2, \u221a3/2).\n2. Triangle with vertices (0,0), (1/2, \u221a3/2), (-1/2, \u221a3/2).\n3. Continuing this way, we explore further combinations.\n\n### Counting Unique Triangles\nTo account for unique triangles:\n- Each triangle can be rotated or reflected, creating equivalent shapes.\n- Triangles formed around one hexagon can be replicated across neighboring hexagons due to symmetrical properties.\n\nFrom our analysis, we find:\n- **6 unique equilateral triangles** with a side length of 1.\n- Additionally, we can form **2 triangles** with a side length of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) by skipping one nearest neighbor in the lattice.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter a thorough examination of configurations and symmetries in the hexagonal lattice, we conclude that the total number of unique equilateral triangles that can be formed is:\n- 6 (for side length 1) + 2 (for side length \\(\\sqrt{3}\\)) = **8 triangles**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<8> solution</8>",
  "ground_truth": "Number the points clockwise, beginning with the upper left as 1. Number the center point 7.\n\nWe can create six equilateral triangles with side length one: 176, 172, 273, 657, 574, and 473.\n\nWe can also create two equilateral triangles with side length $\\sqrt{3}$: 135 and 246.\n\nThus, there are $\\boxed{8}$ such equilateral triangles."
