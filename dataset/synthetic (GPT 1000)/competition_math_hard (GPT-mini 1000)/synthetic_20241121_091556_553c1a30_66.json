  "problem": "4 12-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the number of dice showing a two digit number is equal to the number of dice showing a one digit number? Express your answer as a common fraction. (Assume that the numbers on the 12 sides are the numbers from 1 to 12 expressed in decimal.)",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of rolling 4 twelve-sided dice, we need to find the probability that exactly 2 dice show one-digit numbers and 2 dice show two-digit numbers.\n\n### Step 1: Categorization of Numbers\n- **One-digit numbers** (from the dice): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (9 options total).\n- **Two-digit numbers**: 10, 11, 12 (3 options total).\n\n### Step 2: Setting Up the Probability\nLet:\n- \\( X \\) = number of dice showing one-digit numbers.\n- \\( Y \\) = number of dice showing two-digit numbers.\n\nWe require \\( X = Y \\).\nSince there are 4 dice, we can express this relationship as:\n- \\( X + Y = 4 \\)\n- With \\( X = Y \\), it follows that \\( 2X = 4 \\), which simplifies to \\( X = 2 \\) and \\( Y = 2 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Probability\nWe need the probability that exactly 2 of the 4 dice show one-digit numbers and the other 2 show two-digit numbers. Using the binomial probability formula, we calculate:\n\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = \\binom{4}{2} p^2 (1-p)^2\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( n = 4 \\) (total dice rolled),\n- \\( k = 2 \\) (2 successes),\n- \\( p = \\frac{9}{12} \\) (probability of rolling a one-digit number),\n- \\( 1 - p = \\frac{3}{12} \\) (probability of rolling a two-digit number).\n\n### Step 4: Computing the Components\n- **Number of ways to choose which 2 out of 4 dice show one-digit**: \n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\n- **Probability calculation**: \n\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = 6 \\left(\\frac{9}{12}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{12}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating it step-by-step:\n\n\\[\n= 6 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{81}{144}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{9}{144}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 6 \\cdot \\frac{729}{20736}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{4374}{20736}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplifying the Probability\nWe simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{4374}{20736} \\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4374 and 20736. After simplification:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4374 \\div 81}{20736 \\div 81} = \\frac{54}{256} = \\frac{27}{128}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the probability that the number of dice showing two-digit numbers equals the number of dice showing one-digit numbers is:\n\n<ANSWER> 27/128 </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since 9 out of the 12 possible results are one digit numbers, each die will show a one digit number with probability of $\\frac{3}{4}$ and a two digit number with probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$. The probability that two particular dice will show 2 two digit numbers and 2 one digit numbers is thus $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2$. There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to select which two dice will show one digit numbers, so we multiply to get the probability that we want: $6\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{54}{256}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{27}{128}}$."
