  "problem": "Bob is trying to decide between two cell phone plans. Plan A has no flat fee, but the user must pay $10$ cents per minute on the phone. Plan B requires a one-time fee of $\\$20$, but only requires a payment of $5$ cents per minute on the phone. What is the minimum whole number of minutes Bob has to use the phone for to make Plan B the cheaper plan?",
  "solution": "To find out when Plan B becomes more cost-effective than Plan A for phone usage, we establish equations representing the costs for both plans based on the number of minutes used (denoted as \\( m \\)).\n\n1. **Cost Definitions:**\n   - **Plan A:** Costs $10$ cents per minute without any flat fee.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of Plan A} = 10m \\quad \\text{(in cents)}\n     \\]\n   - **Plan B:** Charges a flat fee of $20 (or $2000$ cents) plus $5$ cents per minute.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of Plan B} = 2000 + 5m \\quad \\text{(in cents)}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Setting Up the Inequality:**\n   We need to determine the value of \\( m \\) for which Plan B is cheaper than Plan A. This can be represented with the inequality:\n   \\[\n   2000 + 5m < 10m\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solving the Inequality:**\n   To isolate \\( m \\), we rearrange the terms:\n   \\[\n   2000 < 10m - 5m\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   2000 < 5m\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 5 results in:\n   \\[\n   400 < m\n   \\]\n   This indicates:\n   \\[\n   m > 400\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding the Minimum Whole Number of Minutes:**\n   Since \\( m \\) must be a whole number, the smallest integer that satisfies this condition is \\( 401 \\).\n\nTherefore, Bob must use the phone for at least:\n\\[\n\\text{Minimum minutes} = 401\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>401</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of minutes that Bob anticipates using. Plan A costs $10x$ cents, while Plan B costs $2000 + 5x$ cents. We therefore have the inequality \\begin{align*}\n2000+5x &< 10x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2000 &< 5x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 400 &< x.\n\\end{align*} The smallest integer $x$ such that $400 < x$ is $401$. Therefore, Bob must use at least $\\boxed{401}$ minutes to make Plan B cheaper."
