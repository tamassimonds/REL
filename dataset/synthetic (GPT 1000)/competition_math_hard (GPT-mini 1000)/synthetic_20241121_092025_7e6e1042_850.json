  "problem": "A floor 9 feet by 12 feet, is to be tiled with 4-inch-by-6-inch tiles. How many tiles are needed to cover the floor?",
  "solution": "To determine how many tiles are required to cover a floor measuring 9 feet by 12 feet using tiles that measure 4 inches by 6 inches, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Convert floor dimensions to inches\nSince the tile dimensions are in inches, we first convert the floor measurements from feet to inches:\n- Length: 9 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 108 inches\n- Width: 12 feet \u00d7 12 inches/foot = 144 inches\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the area of the floor\nNext, we calculate the area of the floor in square inches:\n- Area of the floor = Length \u00d7 Width = 108 inches \u00d7 144 inches = 15,552 square inches\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the area of one tile\nWe now find the area of a single tile:\n- Area of one tile = 4 inches \u00d7 6 inches = 24 square inches\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the number of tiles needed\nTo determine the total number of tiles required, we divide the area of the floor by the area of one tile:\n- Number of tiles = Area of the floor / Area of one tile = 15,552 square inches / 24 square inches = 648 tiles\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the total number of tiles needed to cover the floor is:\n\n<ANSWER>648 tiles</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Notice how 4 inches = 1/3 foot and 6 inches = 1/2 foot, so both the width and length will be tiled with full tiles (i.e. no tiles have to be broken).  Since all tiles remain whole, we can calculate the number of tiles by dividing the total floor area by each tile's area.  Doing so yields \\[\\frac{9 \\text{ ft} \\cdot 12\\text{ ft}}{4 \\text{ inches} \\cdot 6 \\text{ inches}} = \\frac{9 \\text{ ft} \\cdot 12\\text{ ft}}{1/3 \\text{ ft} \\cdot 1/2 \\text{ ft}} = \\boxed{648}.\\]Hence, we need $\\boxed{648}$ tiles to cover the floor."
