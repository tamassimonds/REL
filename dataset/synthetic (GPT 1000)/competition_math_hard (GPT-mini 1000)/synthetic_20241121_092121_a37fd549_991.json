  "problem": "When the decimal point of a certain positive decimal number is moved four places to the right, the new number is four times the reciprocal of the original number. What is the original number?",
  "solution": "Let the original positive decimal number be \\( x \\). When the decimal point of \\( x \\) is moved four places to the right, it becomes \\( 10,000x \\). \n\nAccording to the problem, \\( 10,000x \\) is equal to four times the reciprocal of \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n10,000x = 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{x}\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n10,000x^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by \\( 10,000 \\) to isolate \\( x^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{4}{10,000}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction gives:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{1}{2,500}\n\\]\n\nNow, take the square root of both sides to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2,500}} = \\frac{1}{50}\n\\]\n\nThus, the original number \\( x \\) is:\n\n\\[\nx = 0.02\n\\]\n\nTo verify our solution:\n\n1. Move the decimal point of \\( 0.02 \\) four places to the right:\n\n   \\[\n   0.02 \\rightarrow 200\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate four times the reciprocal of \\( 0.02 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Reciprocal of } 0.02 = \\frac{1}{0.02} = 50\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   4 \\cdot 50 = 200\n   \\]\n\nSince both calculations confirm that \\( 200 = 200 \\), we have verified that our solution is correct. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>0.02 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "If $x$ is the number, then moving the decimal point four places to the right is the same as multiplying $x$ by $10{,}000$. That is, $10{,}000x = 4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$, which is equivalent to $x^2 = 4/10{,}000$. Since $x$ is positive, it follows that $x = 2/100 = \\boxed{0.02}$."
