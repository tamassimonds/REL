  "problem": "What is the product of the numerator and the denominator when $0.\\overline{009}$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms?",
  "solution": "To express the repeating decimal \\(0.\\overline{009}\\) as a fraction, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the repeating decimal**: Let \\(x = 0.009009009\\ldots\\).\n\n2. **Determine the repeating part**: The repeating segment is \"009,\" which consists of 3 digits.\n\n3. **Shift the decimal**: By multiplying \\(x\\) by \\(1000\\), we shift the decimal point three places to the right:\n   \\[\n   1000x = 9.009009009\\ldots\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set up equations**:\n   - From our definition: \\(x = 0.009009009\\ldots\\) (Equation 1)\n   - From the multiplication: \\(1000x = 9.009009009\\ldots\\) (Equation 2)\n\n5. **Eliminate the repeating part**: Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n   \\[\n   1000x - x = 9.009009009\\ldots - 0.009009009\\ldots\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   999x = 9\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\(x\\)**: Dividing both sides by 999 gives:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{9}{999}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Simplify the fraction**: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 9 and 999 is 9. Therefore, we simplify:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9 \\div 9}{999 \\div 9} = \\frac{1}{111}\n   \\]\n\n8. **Final representation**: The repeating decimal \\(0.\\overline{009}\\) in its simplest fractional form is \\(\\frac{1}{111}\\).\n\n9. **Calculate the product of the numerator and denominator**: The numerator is 1 and the denominator is 111, so:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 111 = 111\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>111</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x=0.\\overline{009}$. Then $1000x=9.\\overline{009}$ and $1000x-x=999x=9$. Therefore, $0.\\overline{009}=\\frac{9}{999}$, which in lowest terms is $\\frac{1}{111}$. The product of the numerator and the denominator is $1\\cdot 111=\\boxed{111}$."
