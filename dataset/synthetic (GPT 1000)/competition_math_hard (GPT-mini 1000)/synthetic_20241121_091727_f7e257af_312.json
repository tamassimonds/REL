  "problem": "Billy and Bobbi each selected a positive integer less than 200. Billy's number is a multiple of 18, and Bobbi's number is a multiple of 24. What is the probability that they selected the same number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To determine the probability that Billy and Bobbi selected the same number given that Billy's number is a multiple of 18 and Bobbi's number is a multiple of 24, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Multiples Under 200\n\n**Billy's Choices (Multiples of 18):**\n\n- The largest multiple of 18 less than 200 can be calculated by dividing 200 by 18:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{200}{18} \\approx 11.11 \\Rightarrow \\lfloor 11.11 \\rfloor = 11\n\\]\n\n- Therefore, the multiples of 18 under 200 are:\n\\[\n18, 36, 54, 72, 90, 108, 126, 144, 162, 180, 198\n\\]\n- This results in 11 possible choices for Billy.\n\n**Bobbi's Choices (Multiples of 24):**\n\n- Similarly, for multiples of 24:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{200}{24} \\approx 8.33 \\Rightarrow \\lfloor 8.33 \\rfloor = 8\n\\]\n\n- The multiples of 24 under 200 are:\n\\[\n24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192\n\\]\n- This gives Bobbi 8 possible choices.\n\n### Step 2: Find Common Multiples\n\nTo find the probability that they chose the same number, we need the common multiples of 18 and 24 under 200.\n\n- First, we calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 24 using the greatest common divisor (GCD):\n  \n\\[\n\\text{GCD}(18, 24) = 6\n\\]\n\n- The LCM is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(18, 24) = \\frac{18 \\times 24}{\\text{GCD}(18, 24)} = \\frac{432}{6} = 72\n\\]\n\n- Now, the multiples of 72 under 200 are:\n\n\\[\n72 \\times 1 = 72, \\quad 72 \\times 2 = 144\n\\]\n- Thus, the common multiples of 18 and 24 under 200 are 72 and 144, giving us 2 common choices.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Probability\n\nBilly has 11 choices, and Bobbi has 8 choices. Therefore, the total combinations of their selected numbers are:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 8 = 88\n\\]\n\nConsequently, the probability that they selected the same number is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of common choices}}{\\text{Total combinations}} = \\frac{2}{88} = \\frac{1}{44}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe probability that Billy and Bobbi selected the same number is \n\n\\(\\frac{1}{44}\\).",
  "ground_truth": "We must first find how many positive integers less than 200 are multiples of both 18 and 24. $18=2\\cdot3^2$ and $24=2^3\\cdot3$, so the LCM of 18 and 24 is $2^3\\cdot3^2=72$. Therefore, an integer is a multiple of both 18 and 24 if and only if it is a multiple of 72.\n\nDividing 200 by 72 gives quotient 2 (and remainder 56), so there are 2 multiples of 72 less than 200.\n\nDividing 200 by 18 gives quotient 11 (and remainder 2), so there are 11 multiples of 18 less than 200.\n\nDividing 200 by 24 gives quotient 8 (and remainder 8), so there are 8 multiples of 24 less than 200.\n\nTherefore, Billy and Bobbi together can pick $11\\cdot8=88$ different two-number combinations, and 2 of these involve them choosing the same number (the two multiples of 72 are the possible duplicate numbers). Thus, the probability that they selected the same number is $2/88=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{44}}$."
