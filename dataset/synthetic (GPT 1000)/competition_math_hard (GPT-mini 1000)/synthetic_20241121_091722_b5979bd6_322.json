  "problem": "What is the largest integer that is a divisor of \\[\n(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)\n\\]for all positive even integers $n$?",
  "solution": "The problem requires us to find the largest integer that divides the expression \\((n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)\\) for all positive even integers \\(n\\). We can achieve this through a systematic analysis of the factors.\n\n1. **Substitution of \\(n\\)**: Let \\(n = 2k\\) where \\(k\\) is a positive integer. Then we rewrite the expression:\n   \\[\n   (2k+1)(2k+3)(2k+5)(2k+7)(2k+9)\n   \\]\n   This represents five consecutive odd integers.\n\n2. **Divisibility Analysis**:\n   - **Divisibility by 5**: Among any five consecutive integers, at least one is divisible by 5. Thus, the product is guaranteed to be divisible by 5.\n   - **Divisibility by Powers of 2**: All five factors are odd, hence none are divisible by 2.\n   - **Divisibility by 3**: Similarly, at least one out of every five consecutive integers is divisible by 3. Therefore, the product is also divisible by 3.\n\n3. **Combining Results**: From our analysis, we conclude the product is divisible by:\n   - \\(5\\) (from the presence of an odd integer divisible by 5)\n   - \\(3\\) (from the presence of an integer divisible by 3)\n\n   Since the product is not divisible by 2, we can multiply the established divisors to find the largest integer that divides the product:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Conclusion**: The largest integer that divides \\((n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)\\) for all positive even integers \\(n\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{15}\n   \\]",
  "ground_truth": "Among five consecutive odd numbers, at least one is divisible by 3 and exactly one is divisible by 5, so the product is always divisible by 15. The cases $n=2$, $n=10$, and $n=12$ demonstrate that no larger common divisor is possible, since $\\boxed{15}$ is the greatest common divisor of $3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot9\\cdot11$, $11\\cdot13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19$, and $13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19\\cdot21$."
