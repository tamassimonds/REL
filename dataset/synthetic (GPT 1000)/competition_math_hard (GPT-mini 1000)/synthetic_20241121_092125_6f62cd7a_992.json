  "problem": "$r(x)$ has domain $\\{-1,0,1,2\\}$ and range $\\{0,2,4,6\\}$. $s(x)$ has domain $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and is defined by $s(x)=x+1$. What is the sum of all possible values of $s(r(x))$?",
  "solution": "To find the sum of all possible values of \\( s(r(x)) \\), we will analyze the two functions \\( r(x) \\) and \\( s(x) \\) step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understanding the function \\( r(x) \\)**: \n   - The domain of \\( r(x) \\) is \\( \\{-1, 0, 1, 2\\} \\), and its range is \\( \\{0, 2, 4, 6\\} \\). This implies that for any input from its domain, \\( r(x) \\) will yield one of the values from its range.\n\n2. **Understanding the function \\( s(x) \\)**: \n   - The domain of \\( s(x) \\) is \\( \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\) and it is defined as \\( s(x) = x + 1 \\). Therefore, the possible output values from \\( s(x) \\) are:\n     \\[\n     s(1) = 2, \\quad s(2) = 3, \\quad s(3) = 4, \\quad s(4) = 5\n     \\]\n   - This gives a range of \\( s(x) \\) equal to \\( \\{2, 3, 4, 5\\} \\).\n\n3. **Finding possible values of \\( s(r(x)) \\)**:\n   - We need to determine which outputs of \\( r(x) \\) can serve as valid inputs to \\( s(x) \\). The outputs of \\( r(x) \\) are \\( \\{0, 2, 4, 6\\} \\).\n   - The values \\( 2 \\) and \\( 4 \\) fall within the domain of \\( s(x) \\), while \\( 0 \\) and \\( 6 \\) do not.\n\n4. **Calculating the values of \\( s(r(x)) \\)** for the valid outputs:\n   - For \\( r(x) = 2 \\):\n     \\[\n     s(2) = 2 + 1 = 3\n     \\]\n   - For \\( r(x) = 4 \\):\n     \\[\n     s(4) = 4 + 1 = 5\n     \\]\n\n5. **Listing all possible values of \\( s(r(x)) \\)**:\n   - The valid outputs we calculated are \\( 3 \\) and \\( 5 \\).\n\n6. **Summing the possible values**:\n   - Finally, we compute the total sum of these values:\n   \\[\n   3 + 5 = 8\n   \\]\n\nThus, the sum of all possible values of \\( s(r(x)) \\) is \\( 8 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**: <ANSWER>8</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We are trying to find the range of the function $s(r(x))$. This means we take a number, input it into $r(x)$, take the output and use it as the input for $s(x)$, and find the output. We know that the domain of $s(x)$ is $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, so for $s(r(x))$ to be defined, $r(x)$ must be one of the values $1, 2, 3, 4$. The possible values of $r(x)$ are the range of $r(x)$, which is $\\{0,2,4,6\\}$. The intersection of these two sets is $\\{2,4\\}$, so only $2$ or $4$ can be the output of $r(x)$ and thus the input of $s(x)$ in the function $s(r(x))$. So the possible outputs from $s(x)$ are $2+1=3$ and $4+1=5$. Thus the sum of all possible outputs is $3+5=\\boxed{8}$."
