  "solution": "To solve the problem of finding the area of the shaded square in relation to the area of a larger square formed by a 5x5 grid of points, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Area of the Larger Square**:\n   The larger square is determined by the grid, extending from (0,0) to (4,4). The side length of this square is 4 units, and its area is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of larger square} = \\text{side length}^2 = 4^2 = 16.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the Vertices of the Shaded Square**:\n   The vertices of the shaded square are located at the points (2,2), (3,3), (2,4), and (1,3).\n\n3. **Calculate the Area of the Shaded Square**:\n   We can use the shoelace formula to compute the area based on the coordinates of its vertices. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_1) \\right|.\n   \\]\n   Plugging in our vertices in order:\n   - \\( (2, 2) \\)\n   - \\( (3, 3) \\)\n   - \\( (2, 4) \\)\n   - \\( (1, 3) \\)\n\n   The calculation proceeds as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   \\text{Area} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (2 \\cdot 3 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 2 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\cdot 2) - (2 \\cdot 3 + 3 \\cdot 2 + 4 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 2) \\right| \\\\\n   &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| (6 + 12 + 6 + 2) - (6 + 6 + 4 + 6) \\right| \\\\\n   &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 26 - 22 \\right| \\\\\n   &= \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = 2.\n   \\end{aligned}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the area of the shaded square is 2.\n\n4. **Find the Fraction of the Shaded Area to the Larger Area**:\n   We now calculate the fraction of the shaded square's area relative to the area of the larger square:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\text{Area of shaded square}}{\\text{Area of larger square}} = \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{8}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the fraction of the larger square's area that is occupied by the shaded square is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}} \n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Since the side of the shaded square is a diagonal of the smaller squares, it has area $(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$ square units. The whole grid has area $4^2 = 16$ units, so the ratio of areas is $\\frac{2}{16} =\\boxed{\\frac 18}$."
