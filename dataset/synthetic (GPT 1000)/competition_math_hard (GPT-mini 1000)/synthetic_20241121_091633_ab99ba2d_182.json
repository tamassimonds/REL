  "problem": "A rectangular array of chairs is an arrangement of the chairs in rows and columns such that each row contains the same number of chairs as every other row and each column contains the same number of chairs as every other column.  If there must be at least two chairs in every row and column and all of the chairs in the room must be included, how many arrays are possible in a classroom containing $36$ chairs? Note that $12$ rows of $3$ chairs is different from $3$ rows of $12$ chairs.",
  "solution": "To determine the number of distinct rectangular arrays of 36 chairs that satisfy the condition of having at least 2 rows and 2 columns, we will follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Identify Factor Pairs of 36:**\n   We start by finding all factor pairs (r, c) such that r \u00d7 c = 36. The factor pairs of 36 are:\n   - (1, 36)\n   - (2, 18)\n   - (3, 12)\n   - (4, 9)\n   - (6, 6)\n   - (9, 4)\n   - (12, 3)\n   - (18, 2)\n   - (36, 1)\n\n2. **Filter Valid Pairs:**\n   Since we need at least 2 rows and 2 columns, we exclude any pairs where r or c is less than 2. The remaining valid pairs are:\n   - (2, 18)\n   - (3, 12)\n   - (4, 9)\n   - (6, 6)\n   - (9, 4)\n   - (12, 3)\n   - (18, 2)\n\n3. **Count Distinct Configurations:**\n   Each factor pair (r, c) represents a unique arrangement of chairs. However, we should count both (r, c) and (c, r) as distinct arrangements unless r = c (as in the case of (6, 6)). \n\n   We break down the valid configurations:\n   - (2, 18) and (18, 2) \u2192 2 distinct arrays\n   - (3, 12) and (12, 3) \u2192 2 distinct arrays\n   - (4, 9) and (9, 4) \u2192 2 distinct arrays\n   - (6, 6) \u2192 1 arrangement (not distinct)\n\n   Adding these counts together:\n   - From (2, 18): 2 arrays\n   - From (3, 12): 2 arrays\n   - From (4, 9): 2 arrays\n   - From (6, 6): 1 array\n\n   Therefore, the total number of distinct rectangular arrays is:\n   \\( 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 \\).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe total number of distinct rectangular arrays possible with 36 chairs, ensuring at least 2 chairs in each row and column, is:\n\n<ANSWER>7</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We are counting the number of ways 36 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers such that one of the numbers is not 1. Factoring 36, we find that $36=2^2\\cdot3^2$. The possible values for the number of rows is 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 (notice that we cannot have 1 row). Each value corresponds to a unique arrangement of the chairs. Thus, there are $\\boxed{7}$ possible arrays."
