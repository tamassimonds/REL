  "problem": "A card is chosen at random from a standard deck of 52 cards, and then it is replaced and another card is chosen. What is the probability that at least one of the cards is a diamond or an ace?",
  "solution": "To find the probability that at least one of the two cards drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards is either a diamond or an ace, we can use the complementary probability method. This involves calculating the probability that neither of the cards is a diamond or an ace and then subtracting that probability from 1.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Diamond and Non-Ace Cards:**\n   - There are 52 cards total.\n   - There are 13 diamonds and 4 aces in the deck. However, one ace (the ace of diamonds) is counted among the diamonds.\n   - Therefore, the total number of cards that are either diamonds or aces is:\n     \\[\n     13 \\, (\\text{diamonds}) + 4 \\, (\\text{aces}) - 1 \\, (\\text{ace of diamonds}) = 16\n     \\]\n   - Hence, the number of cards that are neither diamonds nor aces is:\n     \\[\n     52 - 16 = 36\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Probability of Drawing a Non-Diamond and Non-Ace Card:**\n   - The probability of drawing one card that is neither a diamond nor an ace is:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{not diamond or ace}) = \\frac{36}{52} = \\frac{9}{13}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Probability That Both Cards Drawn Are Non-Diamond and Non-Ace:**\n   - Since we assume the card is replaced after drawing, the draws are independent. Therefore, the probability that both cards drawn are neither diamonds nor aces is:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{both not diamond or ace}) = \\left( \\frac{9}{13} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{9}{13} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{9}{13} \\right)^2 = \\frac{81}{169}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability of Drawing At Least One Diamond or Ace:**\n   - To find the probability that at least one of the two cards is a diamond or an ace, subtract the probability that both drawn cards are not from 1:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{at least one is diamond or ace}) = 1 - P(\\text{both not diamond or ace}) = 1 - \\frac{81}{169} = \\frac{169 - 81}{169} = \\frac{88}{169}\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe probability that at least one of the chosen cards is a diamond or an ace is:\n\\[\n\\text{Final Answer: } \\frac{88}{169}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "There are 16 cards in a standard deck which are either diamonds or aces. The probability that neither card chosen is a diamond or an ace is $\\left( \\frac{36}{52} \\right) ^2=\\left( \\frac{9}{13} \\right) ^2=\\frac{81}{169}$. Therefore, the probability that at least one of the cards chosen was a diamond or an ace is $1-\\frac{81}{169}=\\boxed{\\frac{88}{169}}$."
