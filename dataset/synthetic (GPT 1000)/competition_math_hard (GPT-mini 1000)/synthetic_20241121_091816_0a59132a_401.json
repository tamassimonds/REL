  "problem": "The Cubs are playing the Red Sox in the World Series. To win the world series, a team must win 4 games before the other team does. If the Cubs win each game with probability $\\dfrac{3}{5}$ and there are no ties, what is the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series? Express your answer as a percent rounded to the nearest whole percent.",
  "solution": "To find the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series against the Red Sox, we use probabilities based on the individual game outcomes. The Cubs win each game with a probability of \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) and the Red Sox with \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\). We want to determine the chance that the Cubs win 4 games before the Red Sox win 4.\n\n### Step 1: Define Winning Scenarios\nThe Cubs can win the series in several scenarios where the Red Sox win \\( k \\) games before the Cubs secure their fourth win. The possible values for \\( k \\) are \\( 0, 1, 2, \\) or \\( 3 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Probabilities for Each Case\nFor each case, we calculate the probability of the Cubs winning the series:\n\n1. **Case 1: Red Sox win 0 games** (Cubs win all 4 games)\n   \\[\n   P(4,0) = \\binom{3}{0} \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^0 = 1 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^4 = \\frac{81}{625}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Case 2: Red Sox win 1 game** (Cubs win 4, Red Sox win 1)\n   \\[\n   P(4,1) = \\binom{4}{1} \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^1 = 4 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^4 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right) = \\frac{648}{3125}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Case 3: Red Sox win 2 games** (Cubs win 4, Red Sox win 2)\n   \\[\n   P(4,2) = \\binom{5}{2} \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^2 = 10 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^4 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^2 = \\frac{3240}{15625}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Case 4: Red Sox win 3 games** (Cubs win 4, Red Sox win 3)\n   \\[\n   P(4,3) = \\binom{6}{3} \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^3 = 20 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^4 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^3 = \\frac{12960}{78125}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Total Probability\nWe sum the probabilities from all four cases to get the total probability of the Cubs winning the series:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Cubs win}) = P(4,0) + P(4,1) + P(4,2) + P(4,3)\n\\]\n\nCalculating this:\n- Convert each term to a common denominator of \\( 78125 \\):\n  - \\( P(4,0) = \\frac{81}{625} \\times \\frac{125}{125} = \\frac{10125}{78125} \\)\n  - \\( P(4,1) = \\frac{648}{3125} \\times \\frac{25}{25} = \\frac{16200}{78125} \\)\n  - \\( P(4,2) = \\frac{3240}{15625} \\times \\frac{5}{5} = \\frac{16200}{78125} \\)\n  - \\( P(4,3) = \\frac{12960}{78125} \\) (already in the right form)\n\nAdding these fractions:\n\\[\nP(\\text{Cubs win}) = \\frac{10125 + 16200 + 16200 + 12960}{78125} = \\frac{55485}{78125}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Convert to Percentage\nTo express the probability as a percentage:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{55485}{78125} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 71.01\\%\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{71}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "There are four possible cases for the Cubs winning the World Series, depending on the number of games that Red Sox win before the Cubs win their fourth game: the Red Sox can win no games, one game, two games, or three games. In general, if the Red Sox win exactly $k$ games before the Cubs win their 4th game, there will be a total of $3+k$ games played before the last one (which the Cubs must win), there will be a total of $\\dbinom{3+k}{k}$ ways of selecting the games that the Red Sox win out of those, and for each of those arrangements the Cubs will win their 4 games with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4$ and the Red Sox will win the $k$ games that are selected for them with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^k$, so we are left to evaluate the expression $\\dbinom{3+k}{k}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$. This gives us our final probability of  \\begin{align*}\n&\\dbinom{3}{0}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^0 + \\dbinom{3+1}{1}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^1 + \\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad\\dbinom{3+2}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^2 + \\dbinom{3+3}{3}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^3\n\\end{align*} which simplifies to  \\begin{align*}\n&\\ \\ \\ \\ 1\\cdot(.1296)\\cdot1+4\\cdot(.1296)\\cdot(.4)\\\\\n&+10\\cdot(.1296)\\cdot(.16)+20\\cdot(.1296)\\cdot(.064)=.7102\\ldots,\n\\end{align*} so our answer is $\\boxed{71}$ percent."
