  "problem": "An eight-digit integer is formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer. For example, 25,632,563 or 60,786,078 are integers of this form. What is the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form?",
  "solution": "Here's a more coherent summary of the solution:\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of eight-digit integers formed by repeating a four-digit integer, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Form of the Integer**: An eight-digit integer can be represented as \\( n = abcdabcd \\), where \\( abcd \\) is any four-digit integer.\n\n2. **Mathematical Representation**: This eight-digit number can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   n = 10000 \\cdot abcd + abcd = k(10000 + 1) = k \\cdot 10001\n   \\]\n   where \\( k = abcd \\), the four-digit integer.\n\n3. **Range of \\( k \\)**: The four-digit integer \\( k \\) ranges from 1000 to 9999.\n\n4. **Divisibility Insight**: All eight-digit integers of the form \\( abcdabcd \\) are multiples of 10001, since they can be rewritten as \\( k \\cdot 10001 \\).\n\n5. **Examining the GCD**: The greatest common divisor of these eight-digit integers must at least include 10001, as every such number is a multiple of it.\n\n6. **Factor 10001**: Factoring 10001, we find:\n   \\[\n   10001 = 73 \\times 137\n   \\]\n   Here, both 73 and 137 are prime numbers, confirming the complete factorization of 10001.\n\n7. **Final Conclusion**: Since each eight-digit integer can be uniformly expressed as some four-digit integer \\( k \\) multiplied by 10001, and there are no additional common factors across all such integers, we conclude that the GCD of all these eight-digit integers is solely 10001.\n\nThus, the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers formed by repeating a four-digit integer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10001}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "If the repeated four-digit integer is $n$, then the eight-digit integer is $10^4n+n=10001n$. So all numbers in this form share the factor 10001. Consider $10001\\cdot1000$ and $10001\\cdot1001$. After dividing out the factor 10001, 1000 and 1001 share no nontrivial factors, so the greatest common divisor must be exactly $\\boxed{10001}$."
