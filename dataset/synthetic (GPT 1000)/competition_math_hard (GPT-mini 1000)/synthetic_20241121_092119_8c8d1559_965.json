  "problem": "Find the mean of all solutions for $x$ when $x^3 + 3x^2 - 10x = 0$.",
  "solution": "To find the mean of all solutions for the equation \\( x^3 + 3x^2 - 10x = 0 \\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the Equation**: We notice that each term in the polynomial has a common factor of \\( x \\), so we can factor it as:\n   \\[\n   x(x^2 + 3x - 10) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the Factors to Zero**: From the factored form, we can set each factor to zero:\n   - The solutions from the first factor are:\n     \\[\n     x = 0\n     \\]\n   - For the quadratic factor \\( x^2 + 3x - 10 = 0 \\), we will solve it using the quadratic formula.\n\n3. **Solve the Quadratic Equation**: We'll apply the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 3 \\), and \\( c = -10 \\). Plugging in these values:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-10)}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the term under the square root:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 40}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{2}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( \\sqrt{49} = 7 \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-3 \\pm 7}{2}\n   \\]\n   This yields two solutions:\n   - \\( x = \\frac{-3 + 7}{2} = 2 \\)\n   - \\( x = \\frac{-3 - 7}{2} = -5 \\)\n\n4. **List All Solutions**: We now have all solutions:\n   \\[\n   x = 0, \\quad x = 2, \\quad x = -5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Mean**: To find the mean of these solutions, we sum them up and divide by the number of solutions:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = 0 + 2 + (-5) = -3\n   \\]\n   The total number of solutions is 3, so the mean is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mean} = \\frac{-3}{3} = -1\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER> -1 solution </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "First, we factor the equation as $x(x^2 +3x - 10) = 0$.  So, one solution is $x=0$ and the other two solutions are the solutions to $x^2 + 3x-10=0$.  We could either factor the quadratic, or note that the sum of the solutions to this quadratic is $-(3/1)=-3$, so the mean of the three solutions to the original equation is $-3/3=\\boxed{-1}$."
