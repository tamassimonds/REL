  "problem": "Two circles, one of radius 5 inches, the other of radius 2 inches, are tangent at point P. Two bugs start crawling at the same time from point P, one crawling along the larger circle at $3\\pi$ inches per minute, the other crawling along the smaller circle at $2.5\\pi$ inches per minute. How many minutes is it before their next meeting at point P?",
  "solution": "To determine when the two bugs will meet again at point P, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Circumferences of the Circles\n1. **Larger Circle (Radius = 5 inches)**:\n   \\[\n   C_1 = 2\\pi \\times 5 = 10\\pi \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Smaller Circle (Radius = 2 inches)**:\n   \\[\n   C_2 = 2\\pi \\times 2 = 4\\pi \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine Time for Each Bug to Complete One Revolution\n1. **Time for Bug on the Larger Circle (Speed = \\(3\\pi\\) inches/minute)**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time}_1 = \\frac{C_1}{\\text{speed}_1} = \\frac{10\\pi}{3\\pi} = \\frac{10}{3} \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Time for Bug on the Smaller Circle (Speed = \\(2.5\\pi\\) inches/minute)**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time}_2 = \\frac{C_2}{\\text{speed}_2} = \\frac{4\\pi}{2.5\\pi} = \\frac{4}{2.5} = \\frac{8}{5} \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Next Meeting Time\nTo find the next time both bugs meet at point P, we need to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{8}{5}\\).\n\n1. **Finding a Common Denominator**:\n   - The denominators 3 and 5 have a least common multiple of 15.\n   - Convert the times:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{50}{15} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{8}{5} = \\frac{24}{15}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the LCM**:\n   - The LCM is derived from the numerators \\(50\\) and \\(24\\):\n     - Factors of \\(50\\): \\(2 \\times 5^2\\)\n     - Factors of \\(24\\): \\(2^3 \\times 3\\)\n   - Using the highest powers of each prime factor:\n     - \\(2^3\\) (from \\(24\\)), \n     - \\(3^1\\) (from \\(24\\)), \n     - \\(5^2\\) (from \\(50\\))\n   - Thus, LCM = \\(8 \\times 3 \\times 25 = 600\\).\n\n3. **Final LCM Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM time} = \\frac{600}{15} = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the two bugs will meet again at point P after \\( \\textbf{40} \\) minutes.",
  "ground_truth": "The circumference of the larger circle, $C_1$, is $2\\cdot5\\pi=10\\pi$. The circumference of the smaller circle, $C_2$, is $2\\cdot2\\pi=4\\pi$. The bug on $C_1$ crawls the circumference in $\\frac{10\\pi}{3\\pi}=\\frac{10}{3}$ minutes, while the bug on $C_2$ crawls the circumference in $\\frac{4\\pi}{2.5\\pi}=\\frac{8}{5}$ minutes. The two bugs will meet at point P in some $t$ minutes, when $t\\div\\frac{10}{3}=\\frac{3t}{10}$ and $t\\div\\frac{8}{5}=\\frac{5t}{8}$ are both integers. We have $\\text{GCD}(3,10)=\\text{GCD}(5,8)=1$, so we have to find the LCM of $10=2\\cdot5$ and $8=2^3$. The LCM is $2^3\\cdot5=40$, so the bugs will next meet in $t=\\boxed{40}$ minutes."
