  "problem": "Without using a calculator, find the largest prime factor of $15^4+2\\times15^2+1-14^4$.",
  "solution": "To find the largest prime factor of the expression \\( 15^4 + 2 \\times 15^2 + 1 - 14^4 \\), we can follow these steps to simplify and analyze the expression.\n\n1. **Rewrite the Expression:**\n   Let\u2019s denote our expression as:\n   \\[\n   E = 15^4 + 2 \\times 15^2 + 1 - 14^4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Recognize Factoring Opportunities:**\n   The first part, \\( 15^4 + 2 \\times 15^2 + 1 \\), can be recognized as a perfect square and factored:\n   \\[\n   E = (15^2 + 1)^2 - 14^4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expressing \\( 14^4 \\):**\n   We can rewrite \\( 14^4 \\) as:\n   \\[\n   14^4 = (14^2)^2 = 196^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Apply the Difference of Squares Formula:**\n   This allows us to rewrite \\( E \\) using the difference of squares:\n   \\[\n   E = ((15^2 + 1) - 196)((15^2 + 1) + 196)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Specific Values:**\n   We compute \\( 15^2 \\) and \\( 14^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   15^2 = 225 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 14^2 = 196\n   \\]\n   Substituting these back into \\( E \\):\n   \\[\n   E = (225 + 1 - 196)(225 + 1 + 196)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   = (226 - 196)(226 + 196) = 30 \\times 422\n   \\]\n\n6. **Factor the Components:**\n   We need to find the prime factors of \\( 30 \\) and \\( 422 \\):\n   - The prime factorization of \\( 30 \\) is:\n     \\[\n     30 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - For \\( 422 \\), we can factor it:\n     \\[\n     422 = 2 \\times 211\n     \\]\n   To determine if \\( 211 \\) is prime, we check divisibility against prime numbers up to the square root of \\( 211 \\) (approximately \\( 14.5 \\)):\n   - It is not divisible by \\( 2 \\), \\( 3 \\), \\( 5 \\), \\( 7 \\), \\( 11 \\), or \\( 13 \\).\n\n   Since \\( 211 \\) is not divisible by any primes up to \\( 14 \\), it is confirmed to be a prime number.\n\n7. **Identify the Largest Prime Factor:**\n   We now collect all the prime factors found: \\( 2, 3, 5, \\) and \\( 211 \\). The largest among these is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{211}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the largest prime factor of the expression \\( 15^4 + 2 \\times 15^2 + 1 - 14^4 \\) is \\( 211 \\).",
  "ground_truth": "Using the difference of squares factorization, we have  \\begin{align*}\n15^4+2\\times15^2+1-14^4&=(15^2+1)^2-(14^2)^2 \\\\\n&=(15^2+1-14^2)(15^2+1+14^2)\\\\\n&=(15^2-14^2+1)(422)\\\\\n&=((15-14)(15+14)+1)(2\\cdot 211)\\\\\n&=30\\cdot2\\cdot211.\n\\end{align*}Since $211$ is a prime and is larger than the other factor, we see that $\\boxed{211}$ is the largest prime factor."
