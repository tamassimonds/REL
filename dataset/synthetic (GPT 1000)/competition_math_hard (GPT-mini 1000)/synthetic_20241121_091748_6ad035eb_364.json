  "solution": "To solve the problem of calculating the total number of different automobile license plate combinations based on specific conditions, we will break down the solution into clear steps:\n\n### Step 1: Letter Configuration\n1. **Plate Structure:** \n   - The license plate consists of 4 letters, where one letter must be repeated, resulting in a total of 3 unique letters (1 repeated and 2 different).\n\n2. **Selecting Letters:**\n   - **Choose the Repeated Letter:** There are 26 options (A-Z) for the letter that will appear twice.\n   - **Choose Two Unique Letters:** From the remaining 25 letters, we select 2 additional letters. The number of ways to choose these letters is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of ways to choose 2 letters} = \\binom{25}{2} = \\frac{25 \\times 24}{2} = 300.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Arranging the Letters:**\n   - We now have 4 letters: one repeated and two unique. The arrangement of these letters, accounting for the repetition, is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of arrangements} = \\frac{4!}{2!} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12.\n     \\]\n\n### Step 2: Total Combinations for Letters\n- To find the total combinations of letters, we multiply the choices and arrangements:\n\\[\n\\text{Total letter combinations} = (26 \\text{ choices for repeated letter}) \\times (300 \\text{ choices for 2 more letters}) \\times (12 \\text{ arrangements}) = 26 \\times 300 \\times 12.\n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\n26 \\times 300 = 7800,\n\\]\n\\[\n7800 \\times 12 = 93600.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Digit Configuration\n- The license plate also includes 2 digits, which cannot be repeated. The digit choices are as follows:\n  1. Choose the first digit: 10 options (0-9).\n  2. Choose the second digit: 9 options (it cannot be the same as the first).\n  Thus, the total number of digit combinations is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total digit combinations} = 10 \\times 9 = 90.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Total License Plate Combinations\n- Now, we find the overall total combinations by multiplying the letter combinations by the digit combinations:\n\\[\n\\text{Total License Plate Combinations} = 93600 \\times 90.\n\\]\nCalculating this:\n\\[\n93600 \\times 90 = 8424000.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter performing the calculations thoroughly, we conclude that the total number of different license plate combinations is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8424000}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "There are 26 ways to choose the repeated letter, $\\binom{25}{2}$ ways to choose the other two letters, $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose in which two of the four positions to put the repeated letters, 2 ways to choose how to arrange the remaining two letters, 10 ways to choose the first digit and 9 ways to choose the second digit for a total of $(26)\\binom{25}{2}\\binom{4}{2}(2)(10)(9)=\\boxed{8,\\!424,\\!000}$ combinations."
