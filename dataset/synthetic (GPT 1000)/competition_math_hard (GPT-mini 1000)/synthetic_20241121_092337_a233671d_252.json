  "problem": "What is the ratio of the area of a square inscribed in a semicircle with radius $r$ to the area of a square inscribed in a circle with radius $r$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To compare the areas of a square inscribed in a semicircle and a square inscribed in a full circle, we will calculate each area and then determine their ratio.\n\n### Step 1: Area of the Square Inscribed in a Semicircle\n\n1. **Setup**: Consider a semicircle with radius \\( r \\). An inscribed square has its base along the diameter, and its top vertices touch the semicircle's arc.\n2. **Side Length**: Let the side length of the square be \\( s \\). The coordinates of the vertices along the diameter are \\( (x, 0) \\) and \\( (x+s, 0) \\), while the top vertices are at \\( (x, s) \\) and \\( (x+s, s) \\).\n3. **Equation Intersection**: For the top vertices to lie on the semicircle, they must satisfy the semicircle equation \\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\) for \\( y \\geq 0\\). The vertical distance from the diameter to the top of the square is \\( s \\), leading to:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^2 + s^2 = r^2.\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{s^2}{4} + s^2 = r^2 \\implies \\frac{5s^2}{4} = r^2 \\implies s^2 = \\frac{4r^2}{5}.\n   \\]\n4. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square inscribed in the semicircle is:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{semi}} = s^2 = \\frac{4r^2}{5}.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Area of the Square Inscribed in a Circle\n\n1. **Setup**: For a full circle with radius \\( r \\), the inscribed square has its corners touching the circle.\n2. **Diagonal Relation**: The diagonal of the square equals the circle's diameter, so:\n   \\[\n   S\\sqrt{2} = 2r \\implies S = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{2}} = r\\sqrt{2}.\n   \\]\n3. **Area Calculation**: The area of the inscribed square is:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{circle}} = S^2 = (r\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2r^2.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Ratio of the Areas\n\nTo find the ratio of the area of the square inscribed in the semicircle to that of the square inscribed in the circle, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{A_{\\text{semi}}}{A_{\\text{circle}}} = \\frac{\\frac{4r^2}{5}}{2r^2}.\n\\]\nSimplifying this yields:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{4r^2/5}{2r^2} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER> \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) solution </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let $s_1$ be the side length of the square inscribed in the semicircle of radius $r$.  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle shown in the diagram, we have $(s_1/2)^2+s_1^2=r^2$, which implies $s_1^2=\\frac{4}{5}r^2$.  Let $s_2$ be the side length of the square inscribed in the circle of radius $r$.  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle shown in the diagram, we have $(s_2/2)^2+(s_2/2)^2=r^2$, which implies $s_2^2=2r^2$.  Therefore, the ratio of  the areas of the two squares is $\\dfrac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}=\\dfrac{\\frac{4}{5}r^2}{2r^2}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}}$.
