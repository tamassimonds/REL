  "solution": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the dimensions of a square and analyze the figure composed of quarter-circle arcs and straight lines.\n\n1. **Calculate the Side Length of the Square:**\n   The area of the square is given as 81 square units. The side length \\( s \\) can be found using the formula for the area:\n   \\[\n   s^2 = 81 \\implies s = \\sqrt{81} = 9 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Locate Points on Each Side:**\n   Each side of the square is divided into three equal segments, each measuring:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{s}{3} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n   The division points along each side are as follows:\n   - Bottom side (0,0) to (9,0): points at (3,0) and (6,0)\n   - Right side (9,0) to (9,9): points at (9,3) and (9,6)\n   - Top side (9,9) to (0,9): points at (6,9) and (3,9)\n   - Left side (0,9) to (0,0): points at (0,6) and (0,3)\n\n3. **Determine the Length of Straight Segments:**\n   There are four straight segments connecting these points:\n   - From (3,0) to (6,0): length = 3 units\n   - From (9,3) to (9,6): length = 3 units\n   - From (6,9) to (3,9): length = 3 units\n   - From (0,6) to (0,3): length = 3 units\n\n   Therefore, the total length of the straight segments is:\n   \\[\n   3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Length of Quarter-Circle Arcs:**\n   Each corner of the square has a quarter-circle arc with a radius equal to the segment length of 3 units. The length \\( L \\) of one quarter-circle arc is given by:\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 2\\pi r = \\frac{\\pi r}{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( r = 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n   With four such arcs, the total arc length is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times \\frac{3\\pi}{2} = 6\\pi \\text{ units}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the Total Length of the Figure:**\n   Now we combine the lengths of the straight segments and the arcs:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Length} = 12 + 6\\pi\n   \\]\n\n6. **Approximate the Total Length:**\n   Using \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14 \\):\n   \\[\n   6\\pi \\approx 6 \\times 3.14 = 18.84\n   \\]\n   Thus, the total length is:\n   \\[\n   12 + 18.84 \\approx 30.84\n   \\]\n   Rounding to the nearest tenth, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Answer} = 30.8\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total length of the boundary of the bolded figure is:\n<ANSWER>30.8</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since the square has area 81 square units, it must have side length $\\sqrt{81}=9$ units (all number lengths will be in units henceforth). The boundary consists of four straight segments of length $9/3=3$ and four quarter-circle arc segments.  Notice how the four quarter-circle arc segments comprise a full circle of radius $3$; thus their total length is equal to that of the circumference of a circle of radius $3$, which is $6\\pi$.  The total length of the four straight segments is simply $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$.  Hence the total length of both type of segments is $6\\pi + 12$, which is approximately 30.84956.  To the nearest tenth, this value is $\\boxed{30.8}$."
