  "problem": "The increasing sequence $1,3,4,9,10,12,13\\cdots$ consists of all those positive integers which are powers of 3 or sums of distinct powers of 3. Find the $100^{\\mbox{th}}$ term of this sequence.\n",
  "solution": "To find the 100th term in the sequence of positive integers that consist of sums of distinct powers of 3, we can follow a systematic approach:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Powers of 3\nThe powers of 3 are:\n\\[\n3^0 = 1, \\quad 3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad 3^5 = 243, \\quad 3^6 = 729, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert 100 to Binary\nWe need the binary representation of the number 100. This involves successively dividing by 2 and recording the remainders:\n\n1. \\(100 \\div 2 = 50\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n2. \\(50 \\div 2 = 25\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n3. \\(25 \\div 2 = 12\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n4. \\(12 \\div 2 = 6\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n5. \\(6 \\div 2 = 3\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n6. \\(3 \\div 2 = 1\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n7. \\(1 \\div 2 = 0\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us:\n\\[\n100_{10} = 1100100_2\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Mapping Binary to Powers of 3\nThe binary digits correspond to the inclusion of specific powers of 3:\n- The binary number \\(1100100\\) implies:\n  - \\(1 \\cdot 3^6\\) (included)\n  - \\(1 \\cdot 3^5\\) (included)\n  - \\(0 \\cdot 3^4\\) (not included)\n  - \\(0 \\cdot 3^3\\) (not included)\n  - \\(1 \\cdot 3^2\\) (included)\n  - \\(0 \\cdot 3^1\\) (not included)\n  - \\(0 \\cdot 3^0\\) (not included)\n\nThus, we can express the sum for the 100th term as:\n\\[\n100 = 3^6 + 3^5 + 3^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Sum\nNow, we calculate the sum of the relevant powers:\n\\[\n3^6 = 729, \\quad 3^5 = 243, \\quad 3^2 = 9\n\\]\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[\n729 + 243 + 9 = 981\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nHence, the 100th term in the sequence of sums of distinct powers of 3 is:\n<ANSWER> 981 </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Rewrite all of the terms in base 3. Since the numbers are sums of distinct powers of 3, in base 3 each number is a sequence of 1s and 0s (if there is a 2, then it is no longer the sum of distinct powers of 3). Therefore, we can recast this into base 2 (binary) in order to determine the 100th number. $100$ is equal to $64 + 32 + 4$, so in binary form we get $1100100$. However, we must change it back to base 10 for the answer, which is $3^6 + 3^5 + 3^2 = 729 + 243 + 9 = \\boxed{981}$."
