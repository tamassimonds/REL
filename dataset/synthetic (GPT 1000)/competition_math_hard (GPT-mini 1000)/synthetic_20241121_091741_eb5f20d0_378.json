  "problem": "Five couples were at a party. If each person shook hands exactly once with everyone else except his/her spouse, how many handshakes were exchanged? (Note: One obviously doesn't shake hands with oneself.)",
  "solution": "To determine the total number of handshakes exchanged at the party, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Count the total number of people**:  \n   There are 5 couples at the party, which means the total number of people is:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ couples} \\times 2 \\text{ people per couple} = 10 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of handshakes without restrictions**:  \n   If there were no restrictions and everyone shook hands with everyone else, the number of handshakes can be calculated using the combinations formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Handshakes} = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( n = 10 \\), so we find:  \n   \\[\n   \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45 \\text{ handshakes}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Account for handshakes not made with spouses**:  \n   Each of the 5 couples does not shake hands with their respective spouse, resulting in 5 handshakes that are not exchanged.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of actual handshakes**:  \n   Therefore, the total number of handshakes exchanged at the party is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Handshakes} = 45 \\text{ (total possible)} - 5 \\text{ (handshakes not made)} = 40 \\text{ handshakes}\n   \\]\n\nAs a result, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>40 handshakes exchanged</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "There are a total of 10 people at the party.  Each shakes hands with everyone else, except for their spouse, which will be a total of $10-2=8$ other people.  The total number of handshakes will be $10\\cdot8/2=\\boxed{40}$, where we divide by 2 to correct for counting each handshake twice."
