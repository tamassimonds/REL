  "solution": "To solve the problem of finding the greatest integer \\( x \\) such that \\( |6x^2 - 47x + 15| \\) is a prime number, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Define the function\nThe function of interest is:\n\\[\nf(x) = 6x^2 - 47x + 15.\n\\]\nOur goal is to determine when \\( |f(x)| \\) is a prime number.\n\n### Step 2: Find the roots of the quadratic\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of \\( f(x) \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{47 \\pm \\sqrt{(-47)^2 - 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 15}}{2 \\cdot 6}.\n\\]\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\\[\n(-47)^2 - 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 15 = 2209 - 360 = 1849.\n\\]\nTaking the square root:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1849} = 43.\n\\]\nNow we find the roots:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{47 \\pm 43}{12} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{90}{12} = 7.5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\nThus, \\( f(x) \\) crosses the x-axis at \\( x = 7.5 \\) and \\( x = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Test integer values\nWe will evaluate \\( |f(x)| \\) for integer values of \\( x \\), starting from an upper bound and working downward:\n\n- **For \\( x = 8 \\)**:\n  \\[\n  f(8) = 6(64) - 376 + 15 = 384 - 376 + 15 = 23.\n  \\]\n  \\( |23| = 23 \\), which is prime.\n\n- **For \\( x = 7 \\)**:\n  \\[\n  f(7) = 6(49) - 329 + 15 = 294 - 329 + 15 = -20.\n  \\]\n  \\( |-20| = 20 \\), which is not prime.\n\n- **For \\( x = 6 \\)**:\n  \\[\n  f(6) = 6(36) - 282 + 15 = 216 - 282 + 15 = -51.\n  \\]\n  \\( |-51| = 51 \\), which is not prime.\n\n- **For \\( x = 5 \\)**:\n  \\[\n  f(5) = 6(25) - 235 + 15 = 150 - 235 + 15 = -70.\n  \\]\n  \\( |-70| = 70 \\), which is not prime.\n\n- **For \\( x = 4 \\)**:\n  \\[\n  f(4) = 6(16) - 188 + 15 = 96 - 188 + 15 = -77.\n  \\]\n  \\( |-77| = 77 \\), which is not prime.\n\n- **For \\( x = 3 \\)**:\n  \\[\n  f(3) = 6(9) - 141 + 15 = 54 - 141 + 15 = -72.\n  \\]\n  \\( |-72| = 72 \\), which is not prime.\n\n- **For \\( x = 2 \\)**:\n  \\[\n  f(2) = 6(4) - 94 + 15 = 24 - 94 + 15 = -55.\n  \\]\n  \\( |-55| = 55 \\), which is not prime.\n\n- **For \\( x = 1 \\)**:\n  \\[\n  f(1) = 6(1) - 47 + 15 = 6 - 47 + 15 = -26.\n  \\]\n  \\( |-26| = 26 \\), which is not prime.\n\n- **For \\( x = 0 \\)**:\n  \\[\n  f(0) = 6(0) - 47(0) + 15 = 15.\n  \\]\n  \\( |15| = 15 \\), which is not prime.\n\n- **For \\( x = -1 \\)**:\n  \\[\n  f(-1) = 6(1) + 47 + 15 = 6 + 47 + 15 = 68.\n  \\]\n  \\( |68| = 68 \\), which is not prime.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter testing the integer values of \\( x \\), the only one that results in \\( |f(x)| \\) being prime is when \\( x = 8 \\) which yields \\( |f(8)| = 23 \\). \n\nThus, the greatest integer \\( x \\) such that \\( |6x^2 - 47x + 15| \\) is prime is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "We can factor the quadratic $6x^2-47x+15$ as $(2x-15)(3x-1)$. So we have $|6x^2-47x+15|=|(2x-15)(3x-1)|=|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|$. In order for $|6x^2-47x+15|$ to be prime, its only divisors must be $1$ and itself. Thus one of $|2x-15|$ or $|3x-1|$ must be equal to $1$.\n\nIf $|3x-1|=1$, then $3x-1=1$ or $3x-1=-1$. These equations yield $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $x=0$, respectively. We throw out $x=\\frac{2}{3}$ since it is not an integer, and keep $x=0$ as a candidate.\n\nIf $|2x-15|=1$, then $2x-15=1$, in which case $2x=16$ and $x=8$, or $2x-15=-1$, in which case $2x=14$ and $x=7$.\n\nThus our candidates for the greatest $x$ are $0, 7$, and $8$. It remains to check whether the other factor is prime. We first check $x=8$. Since $|2x-15|=1$, we know $|2x-15|\\cdot|3x-1|=|3x-1|=|24-1|=23$, which is prime. Thus $\\boxed{8}$ is the largest integer for which $|6x^2-47x+15|$ is prime."
