  "problem": "Automobile license plates for a state consist of four letters followed by a dash and two single digits. How many different license plate combinations are possible if exactly one letter is repeated exactly once, but digits cannot be repeated?

  "solution": "To determine the total number of different license plate combinations under the specified conditions, we can break the problem down into two main parts: the selection and arrangement of letters, and the selection of digits.\n\n### Part 1: Selecting and Arranging the Letters\n\n1. **Choosing the Repeated Letter:**\n   - We begin by selecting one letter to repeat. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, providing us with:\n     \\[\n     26 \\text{ choices for the repeated letter (A)}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Selecting Two Distinct Letters:**\n   - After choosing the repeated letter A, we select two additional distinct letters from the remaining 25 letters. The number of ways to choose 2 letters can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{25}{2} = \\frac{25 \\times 24}{2 \\times 1} = 300\n     \\]\n\n3. **Arranging the Letters:**\n   - Once we have the letters (A, A, B, C), we need to determine how many distinct arrangements can be made. The formula for the permutations of a multiset gives us:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4!}{2! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1!} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n     \\]\n\n### Total Letter Combinations\nCombining these calculations, the total number of letter combinations is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Letter Combinations} = 26 \\times 300 \\times 12 = 93,600\n\\]\n\n### Part 2: Selecting the Digits\n\n1. **Choosing the Digits:**\n   - For the digit selection, we need two distinct digits chosen from the 10 digits (0 through 9). The selection occurs as follows:\n   - The first digit has 10 options, and the second digit (which must be different from the first) has 9 options:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 9 = 90\n     \\]\n\n### Final Calculation of Total License Plates\nNow, to find the total number of license plate combinations, we multiply the total letter combinations by the total digit combinations:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Combinations} = 93,600 \\times 90 = 8,424,000\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of different license plate combinations possible is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8,424,000}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "There are 26 ways to choose the repeated letter, $\\binom{25}{2}$ ways to choose the other two letters, $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose in which two of the four positions to put the repeated letters, 2 ways to choose how to arrange the remaining two letters, 10 ways to choose the first digit and 9 ways to choose the second digit for a total of $(26)\\binom{25}{2}\\binom{4}{2}(2)(10)(9)=\\boxed{8,\\!424,\\!000}$ combinations."
