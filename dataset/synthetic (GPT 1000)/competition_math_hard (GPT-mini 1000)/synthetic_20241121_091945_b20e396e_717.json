  "problem": "The graph of $y=\\frac{5x^2-9}{3x^2+5x+2}$ has a horizontal asymptote at $y=a$.  What is $a$?",
  "solution": "To find the horizontal asymptote of the function \\( y = \\frac{5x^2 - 9}{3x^2 + 5x + 2} \\), we focus on the leading terms of the numerator and denominator as \\( x \\) approaches infinity.\n\n1. **Identify the leading terms**: The numerator is \\( 5x^2 - 9 \\) and the denominator is \\( 3x^2 + 5x + 2 \\). The leading term in the numerator is \\( 5x^2 \\), and in the denominator, it is \\( 3x^2 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the degrees**: Both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials of degree 2 (since both lead with \\( x^2 \\)).\n\n3. **Calculate the horizontal asymptote**: For rational functions where the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal, the horizontal asymptote is found by dividing the leading coefficients:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{\\text{leading coefficient of numerator}}{\\text{leading coefficient of denominator}} = \\frac{5}{3}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the horizontal asymptote of the graph is at \\( y = \\frac{5}{3} \\).\n\nIn summary, the value of the horizontal asymptote \\( a \\) is \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\).",
  "ground_truth": "To determine the horizontal asymptotes, we consider what happens as $x$ becomes very large.  It appears that, as $x$ becomes very large, the rational function becomes more and more like  \\[y\\approx\\frac{5x^2}{3x^2},\\]so it should become closer and closer to $\\frac53$.\n\nWe can see this explicitly by dividing both the numerator and denominator by $x^2$.  This gives  \\[y=\\frac{5-\\frac{9}{x^2}}{3+\\frac{5}{x}+\\frac{2}{x^2}}.\\]Indeed, as $x$ gets larger, all of the terms other than 5 in the numerator and 3 in the denominator become very small, so the horizontal asymptote is $y=\\boxed{\\frac53}$."
