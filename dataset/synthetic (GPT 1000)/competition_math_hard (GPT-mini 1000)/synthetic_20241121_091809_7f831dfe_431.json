  "problem": "A mother purchases 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 2 green plates, and 1 orange plate. How many ways are there for her to arrange these plates for dinner around her circular table if she doesn't want the 2 green plates to be adjacent?\n",
  "solution": "To determine the number of arrangements of plates around a circular table with the condition that two green plates are not adjacent, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Arrangements Without Restrictions\n\nFirst, we calculate the total arrangements of the plates without any restrictions. The mother has:\n\n- 5 blue plates\n- 2 red plates\n- 2 green plates\n- 1 orange plate\n\nThis totals to \\(10\\) plates. For circular arrangements with indistinguishable items, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Arrangements} = \\frac{(n-1)!}{n_1! \\cdot n_2! \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot n_k!}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(n\\) is the total number of items and \\(n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k\\) are the counts of indistinguishable items. Plugging our values in:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Arrangements} = \\frac{(10-1)!}{5! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 1!} = \\frac{9!}{5! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 1!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n- \\(9! = 362880\\)\n- \\(5! = 120\\)\n- \\(2! = 2\\)\n- \\(1! = 1\\)\n\nSubstituting these into the formula yields:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Arrangements} = \\frac{362880}{120 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{362880}{480} = 756\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Arrangements With Green Plates Together\n\nNext, we consider the situation where the two green plates are adjacent. We treat the two green plates as a single block, reducing the problem to arranging:\n\n- 1 green plate block\n- 5 blue plates\n- 2 red plates\n- 1 orange plate\n\nThis gives a total of \\(9\\) items to arrange. We apply the circular arrangement formula again:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Arrangements with Green Plates Together} = \\frac{(9-1)!}{5! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 1!} = \\frac{8!}{5! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 1!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the factorials:\n- \\(8! = 40320\\)\n\nSubstituting gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Arrangements with Green Plates Together} = \\frac{40320}{120 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{40320}{240} = 168\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Arrangements Where Green Plates Are Not Together\n\nTo find the number of arrangements where the green plates are not adjacent, we subtract the arrangements where they are together from the total arrangements:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Arrangements where Green Plates are not Together} = \\text{Total Arrangements} - \\text{Arrangements with Green Plates Together}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Arrangements where Green Plates are not Together} = 756 - 168 = 588\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to arrange the plates such that the two green plates are not adjacent is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{588}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "We apply the complement principle: we find the total number of cases in which the 2 green places are adjacent, and subtract from the total number of cases.\nThere are $\\frac{10!}{5!2!2!1!} = 7560$ ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion. However, since the plates are arranged in a circle, there are $10$ ways to rotate the plates, and so there are $7560/10 = 756$ ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion (consider, for example, fixing the orange plate at the top of the table).\nIf the two green plates are adjacent, we may think of them as a single entity, so that there are now $9$ objects to be placed around the table in a circular fashion. Using the same argument, there are $\\frac{9!}{5!2!1!1!} = 1512$ ways to arrange the objects in a linear fashion, and $1512/9 = 168$ ways in a circular fashion.\nThus, the answer is $756 - 168 = \\boxed{588}$."
