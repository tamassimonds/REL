  "problem": "There are $20n$ members in the Trumpington marching band, and when they line up in rows of 26, there are 4 band members left over. If $n$ is an integer and there are fewer than 1000 band members, what is the maximum number of people that could be in the Trumpington marching band?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of members in the Trumpington marching band, we start with the information that there are \\(20n\\) members, and when lined up in rows of 26, there are 4 members left over. Here\u2019s the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Express the number of members**: The total number of members \\(N\\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   N = 20n\n   \\]\n   where \\(n\\) is an integer.\n\n2. **Set up the congruence**: The condition about the leftover members translates to the equation:\n   \\[\n   N \\equiv 4 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 26)\n   \\]\n   By substituting \\(N\\):\n   \\[\n   20n \\equiv 4 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 26)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the congruence**: We can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 4:\n   \\[\n   5n \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 13)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Finding the multiplicative inverse**: To solve \\(5n \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 13)\\), we seek an integer \\(m\\) such that:\n   \\[\n   5m \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 13)\n   \\]\n   Testing values, we find \\(m = 8\\) works since:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 8 = 40 \\equiv 1 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 13)\n   \\]\n   Thus, the inverse is 8.\n\n5. **Solving for \\(n\\)**: We multiply both sides of \\(5n \\equiv 1\\) by 8:\n   \\[\n   n \\equiv 8 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 13)\n   \\]\n   This gives us:\n   \\[\n   n = 8 + 13k\n   \\]\n   for some integer \\(k\\).\n\n6. **Finding a bound for \\(n\\)**: Since \\(N\\) must be less than 1000:\n   \\[\n   20n < 1000 \\implies n < 50\n   \\]\n\n7. **Setting up the inequality**:\n   \\[\n   8 + 13k < 50\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(k\\):\n   \\[\n   13k < 42 \\implies k < \\frac{42}{13} \\approx 3.23\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\(k\\) can take the integer values 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n8. **Finding the maximum \\(n\\)**: The largest integer value for \\(k\\) is 3:\n   \\[\n   n = 8 + 13(3) = 8 + 39 = 47\n   \\]\n\n9. **Calculating the total number of members**:\n   \\[\n   N = 20n = 20 \\times 47 = 940\n   \\]\n\n10. **Verifying the conditions**: We check that \\(N\\) meets the original remainder condition:\n   \\[\n   940 \\div 26 = 36 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied, the maximum number of members in the Trumpington marching band is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{940}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Since there are 4 band members left over when they line up in rows of 26, we have $20n \\equiv 4\\pmod{26}$. We divide both sides of the congruence by 4, remembering that we have to divide 26 by the greatest common divisor of 4 and 26. The original congruence is equivalent to \\[\n5n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]So we would like to find a multiple of 13 which is one less than a multiple of 5. Noticing that $13\\cdot 3$ has a units digit of 9, we identify $(13\\cdot 3 + 1)/5 =8$ as the inverse of 5 (mod 13). Multiplying both sides of our congruence by 8 gives \\[\nn \\equiv 8 \\pmod{13}.\n\\]We have found that $n$ satisfies the conditions given in the problem if $n=8+13k$ for some positive integer $k$ and $20n<1000$. Rewriting the inequality $20n<1000$ as $n<50$, we solve $8+13k < 50$ to find that the maximum solution is $k=\\lfloor 42/13\\rfloor = 3$. When $k=3$, the number of band members is $20(8+13(3))=\\boxed{940}$."
