  "problem": "Find all $c$ which satisfy $$\\frac{c}{3} \\le 2+c < -2(1+c).$$Express your answer in interval notation, simplifying any fractions which occur in your answer.",
  "solution": "To solve the compound inequality \n\n\\[\n\\frac{c}{3} \\le 2 + c < -2(1 + c),\n\\]\n\nwe break it into two parts and solve each separately.\n\n### Step 1: Solve \\(\\frac{c}{3} \\le 2 + c\\)\n\n1. Eliminate the fraction by multiplying the entire inequality by 3:\n   \\[\n   c \\le 6 + 3c.\n   \\]\n\n2. To isolate \\(c\\), subtract \\(3c\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   -2c \\le 6.\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide by -2 (which reverses the inequality):\n   \\[\n   c \\ge -3.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve \\(2 + c < -2(1 + c)\\)\n\n1. Distribute on the right side:\n   \\[\n   2 + c < -2 - 2c.\n   \\]\n\n2. Add \\(2c\\) to both sides:\n   \\[\n   2 + 3c < -2.\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract 2 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   3c < -4.\n   \\]\n\n4. Divide by 3:\n   \\[\n   c < -\\frac{4}{3}.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Results\n\nNow we combine our results from both steps:\n\n1. From Step 1: \\(c \\ge -3\\)\n2. From Step 2: \\(c < -\\frac{4}{3}\\)\n\nThis gives us the combined inequality:\n\\[\n-3 \\le c < -\\frac{4}{3}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Step: Write in Interval Notation\n\nThe solution in interval notation is:\n\\[\n[-3, -\\frac{4}{3}).\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final solution is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{[-3, -\\frac{4}{3})}.\n\\] \n\nThis clearly indicates the range for \\(c\\) that satisfies the original compound inequality.",
  "ground_truth": "We have two inequalities which $c$ must satisfy. We consider these inequalities one at a time.\n\nThe first inequality is $\\frac{c}{3}\\le 2+c$. Multiplying both sides by $3$, we have $$c\\le 6+3c.$$Subtracting $3c$ from both sides gives $$-2c\\le 6.$$We can divide both sides by $-2$, but we must reverse the inequality since $-2$ is negative. This gives $c\\ge -3$.\n\nThe second inequality is $2+c < -2(1+c)$. Expanding the right side, we have $$2+c < -2-2c.$$Adding $2c-2$ to both sides gives $$3c<-4.$$Dividing both sides by $3$ gives $c<-\\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nSo, all $c$ which satisfy both inequalities are given by $-3\\le c<-\\frac{4}{3}$, or, in interval notation, $c\\in\\boxed{\\left[-3,-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)}$."
