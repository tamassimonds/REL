  "problem": "A list of five positive integers has a median of 3 and a mean of 11. What is the maximum possible value of the list's largest element?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we begin by defining five positive integers: \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 \\), arranged in non-decreasing order such that \\( a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq a_3 \\leq a_4 \\leq a_5 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Define the Median and Mean\n\n1. **Median**: For a list of five numbers, the median is the third number in order. Given the problem states that \\( a_3 = 3 \\).\n  \n2. **Mean**: The mean is calculated as the total sum of the integers divided by the count of integers. Since the mean is given as 11:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5}{5} = 11\n   \\]\n   This leads to:\n   \\[\n   a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 55\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Substitute the Known Median Value\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( a_3 \\):\n\\[\na_1 + a_2 + 3 + a_4 + a_5 = 55\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\na_1 + a_2 + a_4 + a_5 = 52\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Maximize \\( a_5 \\)\n\nTo find the maximum value of \\( a_5 \\), we should minimize \\( a_1, a_2, \\) and \\( a_4 \\). Since \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\) must be positive integers and cannot exceed \\( a_3 \\), we can choose:\n\\[\na_1 = 1, \\quad a_2 = 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Remaining Values\n\nSubstituting these values in:\n\\[\n1 + 1 + a_4 + a_5 = 52\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\na_4 + a_5 = 50\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, since \\( a_4 \\) must be at least equal to \\( a_3 \\) (which is 3):\n\\[\na_4 \\geq 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Set \\( a_4 \\) to Its Minimum\n\nWe can set \\( a_4 = 3 \\) to minimize its contribution:\n\\[\n3 + a_5 = 50\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\na_5 = 50 - 3 = 47\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Verify the Conditions\n\nWe now have the integers:\n\\[\na_1 = 1, \\quad a_2 = 1, \\quad a_3 = 3, \\quad a_4 = 3, \\quad a_5 = 47\n\\]\nLet\u2019s check if all conditions are satisfied:\n- The median (third number) is \\( 3 \\).\n- The sum is:\n  \\[\n  1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 47 = 55\n  \\]\n- The mean is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{55}{5} = 11\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the maximum possible value of the largest integer \\( a_5 \\) is:\n<ANSWER>47 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since the 5 numbers have a mean of 11, the sum of the numbers is $5\\cdot 11 = 55$.  To make the largest number as large as possible, we make the other numbers must be as small as possible.  However, in order for the median to be 3, the middle number must be 3.  Since this is the middle number, there must be two other numbers that are at least 3.  So, we let three of the other four numbers be 1, 1, and 3 to make them as small as possible.  Finally, this means the remaining number is $55-1-1-3-3=\\boxed{47}$."
