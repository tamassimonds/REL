  "problem": "The function $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is defined as the largest integer less than or equal to $x$. For example, $\\lfloor 5.67\\rfloor = 5$, $\\lfloor -\\tfrac 14\\rfloor = -1$, and $\\lfloor 8\\rfloor = 8$.\n\nWhat is the range of the function $$f(x) = \\lfloor x\\rfloor - x~?$$Express your answer in interval notation.",
  "solution": "To determine the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\lfloor x \\rfloor - x \\), we can break down the analysis as follows:\n\n1. **Understanding the Floor Function**:\n   The floor function \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \\( x \\). For example:\n   - For \\( x = 2.3 \\), \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2 \\).\n   - For \\( x = -1.7 \\), \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor = -2 \\).\n   - For \\( x = 3 \\), \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor = 3 \\).\n\n2. **Expressing \\( x \\) in Terms of its Parts**:\n   Any real number \\( x \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   x = n + f\n   \\]\n   where \\( n = \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\) (an integer) and \\( f = \\{x\\} = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\) (the fractional part), with \\( 0 \\leq f < 1 \\).\n\n3. **Substituting into the Function**:\n   Substituting this expression into our function gives:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = \\lfloor x \\rfloor - x = n - (n + f) = -f.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Analyzing the Range**:\n   The fractional part \\( f \\) can take any value within the interval \\([0, 1)\\):\n   - When \\( f = 0 \\) (i.e., \\( x \\) is an integer), \\( f(x) = -0 = 0 \\).\n   - As \\( f \\) approaches 1 (but does not reach it), \\( f(x) \\) approaches \\(-1\\).\n\n5. **Determining the Final Range**:\n   Thus, \\( f(x) = -f \\) varies from:\n   - A maximum of \\( 0 \\) (when \\( f = 0 \\)) to\n   - A minimum approaching \\(-1\\) (as \\( f \\) approaches but never reaches 1).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Therefore, the range of \\( f(x) \\) is all values from \\(-1\\) (not inclusive) up to \\(0\\) (inclusive). In interval notation, this is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   (-1, 0].\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER> (-1, 0] solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Note that if $0\\le x<1$, then $\\lfloor x\\rfloor = 0$, so $f(x)=-x$. Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ includes the interval $(-1,0]$. This is in fact the whole domain; $f(x)$ can't be less than or equal to $-1$, because $x$ and $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ necessarily differ by less than $1$, and $f(x)$ can't be positive, because $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is by definition less than or equal to $x$.\n\nTherefore, the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{(-1,0]}$."
