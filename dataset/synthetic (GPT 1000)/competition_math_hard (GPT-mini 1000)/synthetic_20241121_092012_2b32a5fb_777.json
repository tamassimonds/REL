  "problem": "Billy and Bobbi each selected a positive integer less than 200. Billy's number is a multiple of 18, and Bobbi's number is a multiple of 24. What is the probability that they selected the same number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To determine the probability that Billy and Bobbi select the same number from their respective sets of options, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Multiples of 18 Below 200\nTo find how many multiples of 18 are below 200, we calculate the largest integer \\( n \\) such that:\n\\[\n18n < 200\n\\]\nCalculating \\( n \\):\n\\[\nn < \\frac{200}{18} \\approx 11.11\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) can be at most 11. The multiples of 18 less than 200 are:\n\\[\n18, 36, 54, 72, 90, 108, 126, 144, 162, 180, 198\n\\]\nThis gives us a total of 11 multiples of 18.\n\n### Step 2: Find Multiples of 24 Below 200\nNext, we find the multiples of 24 below 200. We seek the largest integer \\( m \\) such that:\n\\[\n24m < 200\n\\]\nCalculating \\( m \\):\n\\[\nm < \\frac{200}{24} \\approx 8.33\n\\]\nThus, \\( m \\) can be at most 8. The multiples of 24 less than 200 are:\n\\[\n24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192\n\\]\nThis totals 8 multiples of 24.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Common Multiples of 18 and 24\nTo find the numbers that are multiples of both 18 and 24, we compute their least common multiple (LCM). The prime factorizations are:\n- \\( 18 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\)\n- \\( 24 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\)\n\nThe LCM is calculated by taking the highest powers of all prime factors:\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(18, 24) = 2^3 \\times 3^2 = 8 \\times 9 = 72\n\\]\nNext, we identify the multiples of 72 that are less than 200:\n\\[\n72 \\times 1 = 72, \\quad 72 \\times 2 = 144\n\\]\nThus, the common multiples of both 18 and 24 below 200 are 72 and 144, giving us a total of 2 common multiples.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability\nNow we compile our findings:\n- Total options for Billy (multiples of 18): 11\n- Total options for Bobbi (multiples of 24): 8\n- Common options: 2\n\nThe probability that Billy and Bobbi select the same number can be calculated using:\n\\[\nP(\\text{same number}) = \\frac{\\text{number of common options}}{\\text{total options for Billy} \\times \\text{total options for Bobbi}} = \\frac{2}{11 \\times 8} = \\frac{2}{88} = \\frac{1}{44}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that Billy and Bobbi selected the same number is:\n\\(\\frac{1}{44}\\)",
  "ground_truth": "We must first find how many positive integers less than 200 are multiples of both 18 and 24. $18=2\\cdot3^2$ and $24=2^3\\cdot3$, so the LCM of 18 and 24 is $2^3\\cdot3^2=72$. Therefore, an integer is a multiple of both 18 and 24 if and only if it is a multiple of 72.\n\nDividing 200 by 72 gives quotient 2 (and remainder 56), so there are 2 multiples of 72 less than 200.\n\nDividing 200 by 18 gives quotient 11 (and remainder 2), so there are 11 multiples of 18 less than 200.\n\nDividing 200 by 24 gives quotient 8 (and remainder 8), so there are 8 multiples of 24 less than 200.\n\nTherefore, Billy and Bobbi together can pick $11\\cdot8=88$ different two-number combinations, and 2 of these involve them choosing the same number (the two multiples of 72 are the possible duplicate numbers). Thus, the probability that they selected the same number is $2/88=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{44}}$."
