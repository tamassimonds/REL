  "problem": "I have five apples and ten oranges. If a fruit basket must contain at least one piece of fruit, how many kinds of fruit baskets can I make?  (The apples are identical and the oranges are identical.  A fruit basket consists of some number of pieces of fruit, and it doesn't matter how the fruit are arranged in the basket.)",
  "solution": "To determine the number of different fruit baskets that can be made using five identical apples and ten identical oranges, while ensuring each basket contains at least one piece of fruit, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Assess the options for apples and oranges.\nSince we have identical fruits, we can count the possible quantities for each type:\n\n#### Apples:\n- We can include 0 to 5 apples in the basket, resulting in 6 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 apples).\n\n#### Oranges:\n- We can include 0 to 10 oranges, which gives us 11 choices (0 through 10 oranges).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate total combinations.\nThe selections of apples and oranges are independent of each other. Therefore, we can find the total combinations by multiplying the number of options for apples by the number of options for oranges:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total combinations} = (\\text{Choices for apples}) \\times (\\text{Choices for oranges}) = 6 \\times 11 = 66\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Exclude the case of an empty basket.\nSince each basket must contain at least one piece of fruit, we must remove the scenario where there are 0 apples and 0 oranges, which counts as one combination. Thus, we need to subtract this from our total:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Valid combinations} = \\text{Total combinations} - \\text{Case with no fruits} = 66 - 1 = 65\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, the total number of different kinds of fruit baskets that can be created, ensuring that each contains at least one fruit, is:\n\n<ANSWER> 65 solution </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "For a moment, consider empty fruit baskets. Now there are $6$ choices total for the apples: no apples, one apple, two apples, three, four, or all five apples. Similarly, there are $11$ choices total for the oranges. Thus, there are $6\\cdot 11 = 66$ potential fruit baskets. But we must subtract one off of that because we counted empty fruit baskets, which aren't actually allowed. So there are $\\boxed{65}$ possible fruit baskets."
