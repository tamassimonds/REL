  "solution": "To determine how many integers \\( n \\) with \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 2012 \\) make the product \n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \\left( \\left( 1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n} \\right)^n + 1 \\right)\n\\]\n\nequal to zero, we must analyze when the expression inside the product becomes zero.\n\n1. **Inner Expression Analysis**:\n   The inner expression we need to evaluate is \n\n   \\[\n   \\left( 1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n} \\right)^n + 1 = 0.\n   \\]\n\n   This rearranges to \n\n   \\[\n   \\left( 1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n} \\right)^n = -1.\n   \\]\n\n   The left-hand side is a complex number that we investigate for conditions under which it has a magnitude of 1 and an argument of \\(\\pi + 2m\\pi\\) (for some integer \\( m \\)).\n\n2. **Magnitude and Argument**:\n   The condition \\( |1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n}| = 1 \\) indicates that \\( 1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n} \\) lies on the unit circle in the complex plane. \n\n   Substituting \\( e^{2 \\pi i k / n} \\) with its polar form \\( \\cos\\left( \\frac{2 \\pi k}{n} \\right) + i \\sin\\left( \\frac{2 \\pi k}{n} \\right) \\), we can express the magnitude condition as:\n\n   \\[\n   (1 + \\cos\\left( \\frac{2\\pi k}{n} \\right))^2 + \\sin^2\\left( \\frac{2\\pi k}{n} \\right) = 1.\n   \\]\n\n   Expanding and simplifying this leads to:\n\n   \\[\n   2\\cos\\left( \\frac{2\\pi k}{n} \\right) + \\cos^2\\left( \\frac{2\\pi k}{n} \\right) = 0.\n   \\]\n\n   From here, we seek the values of \\( n \\) for which the above condition is satisfied.\n\n3. **Finding Valid Values of \\( n \\)**:\n   For the expression \\( \\left( 1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n} \\right)^n = -1 \\) to hold, \\( n \\) must be an odd integer and specifically, it must be an odd multiple of \\( 3 \\).\n\n4. **Counting Odd Multiples of 3**:\n   The odd multiples of \\( 3 \\) form a sequence: \\( 3, 9, 15, \\ldots \\). This sequence can be represented as:\n\n   \\[\n   3(2k + 1) = 3, 9, 15, \\ldots\n   \\]\n\n   We need to find the maximum integer \\( m \\) such that \\( 3(2m + 1) \\leq 2012 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   2m + 1 \\leq \\frac{2012}{3} \\implies 2m + 1 \\leq 670 \\implies m \\leq 334.5.\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, \\( m \\) can take integer values from \\( 0 \\) to \\( 334 \\), which gives us \\( 335 \\) valid odd multiples of \\( 3 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Consequently, the number of integers \\( n \\) satisfying the criteria for the product to be zero are the odd multiples of \\( 3 \\) within the range specified.\n\nThus, the final answer is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{335}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "If the product is $0$, then one of the factors $(1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n})^n + 1$ is $0$.  This means that\n\\[(1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n})^n = -1,\\]which tells us that $  1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n} $ has magnitude $1$, meaning it is on the unit circle. If we translate it to the left by subtracting $1$, we get $e^{2 \\pi i k / n} $ which will also be on the unit circle, and hence have magnitude $1$.\n\nWe can visualize this as the three complex numbers $-1$, $0$, and $e^{2 \\pi i k / n}$ forming the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length $1$. So $e^{2 \\pi i k / n}$ is either $e^{2 \\pi i / 3}$ or its conjugate. This means that $  1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n} $ is either $ e^{ \\pi i / 3} $ or its conjugate, which tells us that $( 1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n})^n$ is either $ e^{ n \\pi i / 3} $ or its conjugate. The only way this can be $-1$ is if $n$ is an odd multiple of $3$, and in this case, the factor corresponding to $k=n/3$ will be zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes counting the odd multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $2012$. Since $2010 = 3\\cdot 670$ there are $670$ multiples of $3$ in this interval, half of which must be odd. Our answer is $\\boxed{335}$."
