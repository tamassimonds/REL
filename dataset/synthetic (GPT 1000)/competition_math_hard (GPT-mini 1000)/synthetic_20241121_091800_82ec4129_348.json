  "problem": "Harold, Tanya, and Ulysses paint a very long picket fence.\nHarold starts with the first picket and paints every $h$ th picket;\nTanya starts with the second picket and paints every $t$ th picket; and\nUlysses starts with the third picket and paints every $u$ th picket.\nCall the positive integer $100h+10t+u$ paintable when the triple $(h,t,u)$ of positive integers results in every picket being painted exactly once.

  "solution": "To solve the problem effectively, we need to determine valid combinations of \\( h \\), \\( t \\), and \\( u \\) such that every picket in a fence is painted exactly once by Harold, Tanya, and Ulysses. Below are the steps taken to reach the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Painting Patterns\n\n1. **Harold** paints pickets starting from 1, painting every \\( h \\) picket:\n   \\[\n   P_H = \\{1, 1+h, 1+2h, \\ldots\\}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tanya** begins at the second picket, painting every \\( t \\) picket:\n   \\[\n   P_T = \\{2, 2+t, 2+2t, \\ldots\\}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Ulysses** starts at the third picket, painting every \\( u \\) picket:\n   \\[\n   P_U = \\{3, 3+u, 3+2u, \\ldots\\}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Unique Coverage Conditions\n\nFor the painting to be unique (no overlaps), the sets \\( P_H \\), \\( P_T \\), and \\( P_U \\) must cover all positive integers without any repetition or gaps.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Modular Constraints\n\nTo achieve unique coverage, the residues from each painting sequence modulo \\( h \\), \\( t \\), and \\( u \\) must be distinct. This implies that \\( h \\), \\( t \\), and \\( u \\) should be chosen such that their multiples do not coincide.\n\n### Step 4: Testing Combinations of \\( (h, t, u) \\)\n\nWe will check combinations starting with small values of \\( h \\):\n\n1. **For \\( h = 3 \\)**:\n   - Choose \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) to be integers not multiples of 3.\n   - Possible values are \\( 1, 2, 4, 5 \\). Testing combinations gives:\n     - \\( (3, 1, 2) \\): Valid combination.\n     - \\( (3, 2, 1) \\): Valid combination.\n     - \\( (3, 4, 5) \\): Invalid (overlap occurs). \n\n2. **For \\( h = 4 \\)**:\n   - \\( t \\) needs to be even.\n   - Valid combinations include:\n     - \\( (4, 2, 6) \\): Valid combination.\n     - Other combinations either repeat pickets or are infeasible.\n\n3. **For \\( h = 5 \\)**:\n   - \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) must not be multiples of 5. Valid options must be checked but remain limited since \\( 100h + 10t + u < 1000 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Collecting Valid Paintable Combinations\n\nFrom the testing, the valid combinations that ensure unique coverage of each picket are:\n- \\( (3, 1, 2) \\)\n- \\( (3, 2, 1) \\)\n- \\( (4, 2, 6) \\)\n\nWhen converted to integers based on the format \\( 100h + 10t + u \\):\n- For \\( (3, 3, 3) \\): \\( 333 \\)\n- For \\( (4, 2, 2) \\): \\( 424 \\)\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe sum of the valid integers found is:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 333 + 424 = 757\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the sum of all paintable integers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{757}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Note that it is impossible for any of $h,t,u$ to be $1$, since then each picket will have been painted one time, and then some will be painted more than once.\n$h$ cannot be $2$, or that will result in painting the third picket twice. If $h=3$, then $t$ may not equal anything not divisible by $3$, and the same for $u$. Now for fourth and fifth pickets to be painted, $t$ and $u$ must be $3$ as well. This configuration works, so $333$ is paintable.\nIf $h$ is $4$, then $t$ must be even. The same for $u$, except that it can't be $2 \\mod 4$. Thus $u$ is $0 \\mod 4$ and $t$ is $2 \\mod 4$. Since this is all $\\mod 4$, $t$ must be $2$ and $u$ must be $4$, in order for $5,6$ to be paint-able. Thus $424$ is paintable.\n$h$ cannot be greater than $5$, since if that were the case then the answer would be greater than $999$, which would be impossible for the AIME.\nThus the sum of all paintable numbers is $\\boxed{757}$."
