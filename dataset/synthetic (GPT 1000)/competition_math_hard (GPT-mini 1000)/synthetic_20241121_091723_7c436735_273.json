  "problem": "How many of the divisors of $8!$ are larger than $7!$?",
  "solution": "To find how many divisors of \\(8!\\) are greater than \\(7!\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(8!\\) and \\(7!\\)**:\n   We compute both factorials:\n   \\[\n   8! = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 40320\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the prime factorization of \\(8!\\)**:\n   To find the number of divisors of \\(8!\\), we first get its prime factorization:\n   \\[\n   8! = 2^7 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 7^1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of divisors of \\(8!\\)**:\n   We use the formula for the number of divisors based on its prime factorization:\n   \\[\n   d(n) = (k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1)(k_3 + 1)(k_4 + 1)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(n\\) corresponds to \\(8!\\) with prime powers \\(k_1 = 7\\), \\(k_2 = 2\\), \\(k_3 = 1\\), and \\(k_4 = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   d(8!) = (7 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 8 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 96\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\(8!\\) has \\(96\\) divisors.\n\n4. **Analyze the divisors in relation to \\(7!\\)**:\n   To find the divisors of \\(8!\\) that are greater than \\(7!\\), we notice that for any divisor \\(d\\) of \\(8!\\), there exists a corresponding divisor \\(\\frac{8!}{d}\\). If \\(d > 7!\\), then it follows that:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8!}{d} < \\frac{8!}{7!} = 8\n   \\]\n   This means that the divisors \\(d\\) greater than \\(7!\\) correspond to the positive integers less than \\(8\\), which are \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\).\n\n5. **Count the valid divisors**:\n   The integers \\(1\\) through \\(7\\) yield \\(7\\) divisors of \\(8!\\) that exceed \\(7!\\).\n\nIn conclusion, the total number of divisors of \\(8!\\) that are greater than \\(7!\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Suppose that $d$ divides $8!$ and that $d>7!$.  Taking the reciprocal of both sides of $d>7!$ and multiplying by $8!$, we find $\\frac{8!}{d}<\\frac{8!}{7!}=8$.  There are 7 positive integers less than 8, and $d$ can be chosen so that $\\frac{8!}{d}$ takes on any of these values, since $\\frac{8!}{d}$ ranges over all the divisors of 8! as $d$ ranges over the divisors of $8!$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{7}$ divisors of 8! are greater than $7!$."
