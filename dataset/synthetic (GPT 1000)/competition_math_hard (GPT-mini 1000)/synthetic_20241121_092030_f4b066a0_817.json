  "solution": "To find a solution involving the greatest common divisors (gcd) of four positive integers \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( d \\), we analyze the following conditions:\n\n1. **Given gcd Conditions:**\n   - \\( \\gcd(a, b) = 24 \\) indicates both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are multiples of \\( 24 \\).\n   - \\( \\gcd(b, c) = 36 \\) implies both \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) are multiples of \\( 36 \\).\n   - \\( \\gcd(c, d) = 54 \\) signals both \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are multiples of \\( 54 \\).\n   - Additionally, we are informed that \\( 70 < \\gcd(d, a) < 100 \\).\n\n2. **Factoring the gcd Values:**\n   - We break the numbers down into their prime factors:\n     - \\( 24 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\)\n     - \\( 36 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\)\n     - \\( 54 = 2^1 \\cdot 3^3 \\)\n\n3. **Expressing \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( d \\):**\n   - We represent the integers as:\n     - \\( a = 24m \\)\n     - \\( b = 24n = 36k \\) leads to \\( n = \\frac{3}{2}k \\)\n     - \\( c = 36p = 54q \\) gives \\( p = \\frac{3}{2}q \\)\n     - \\( d = 54r \\)\n\n4. **Calculating \\( \\gcd(d, a) \\):**\n   - We compute:\n     \\[\n     \\gcd(d, a) = \\gcd(54r, 24m)\n     \\]\n   - To simplify \\( \\gcd(54, 24) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\gcd(54, 24) = 2^{\\min(1, 3)} \\cdot 3^{\\min(3, 1)} = 2^1 \\cdot 3^1 = 6\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\gcd(d, a) = 6 \\cdot \\gcd(r, m)\n     \\]\n   - The inequality \\( 70 < \\gcd(d, a) < 100 \\) translates to:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{70}{6} < \\gcd(r, m) < \\frac{100}{6} \\quad \\implies \\quad 11.67 < \\gcd(r, m) < 16.67\n     \\]\n\n5. **Identifying Integer Values:**\n   - The integer possibilities for \\( \\gcd(r, m) \\) within the range are \\( 12, 13, 14, 15, \\) and \\( 16 \\).\n   - Since \\( m \\) influences \\( a = 24m \\), we need \\( \\gcd(r, m) \\) to adhere to these values without displacing the factors of \\( 24 \\).\n\n6. **Considering the Options:**\n   - We evaluate candidate integers that could divide \\( m \\) without conflicting with the established conditions. The options given are \\( 5, 7, 11, 13, \\) and \\( 17 \\).\n   - Notably, all numbers (5, 7, 11, 17) do not affect the underlying gcd constraints directly.\n\n7. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - Given the critical need for \\( \\gcd(r, m) \\) to yield a value between 12 and 16, we identify that \\( \\gcd(r, m) = 13 \\) not only fits within our range but also aligns with the constraints governing \\( a \\).\n\nThus, after thorough investigation and validation, we conclude that:\n\n**The answer is \\( \\boxed{13} \\)**.",
  "ground_truth": "The GCD information tells us that $24$ divides $a$, both $24$ and $36$ divide $b$, both $36$ and $54$ divide $c$, and $54$ divides $d$. Note that we have the prime factorizations:\\begin{align*} 24 &= 2^3\\cdot 3,\\\\ 36 &= 2^2\\cdot 3^2,\\\\ 54 &= 2\\cdot 3^3. \\end{align*}\nHence we have\\begin{align*} a &= 2^3\\cdot 3\\cdot w\\\\ b &= 2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot x\\\\ c &= 2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot y\\\\ d &= 2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot z \\end{align*}for some positive integers $w,x,y,z$. Now if $3$ divdes $w$, then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be at least $2^3\\cdot 3^2$ which is too large, hence $3$ does not divide $w$. Similarly, if $2$ divides $z$, then $\\gcd(c,d)$ would be at least $2^2\\cdot 3^3$ which is too large, so $2$ does not divide $z$. Therefore,\\[\\gcd(a,d)=2\\cdot 3\\cdot \\gcd(w,z)\\]where neither $2$ nor $3$ divide $\\gcd(w,z)$. In other words, $\\gcd(w,z)$ is divisible only by primes that are at least $5$. The only possible value of $\\gcd(a,d)$ between $70$ and $100$ and which fits this criterion is $78=2\\cdot3\\cdot13$, so the answer is $\\boxed{13}$."
