  "problem": "A rectangle measures 6 meters by 10 meters. Drawn on each side of the rectangle is a semicircle that has the endpoints of its diameter on the vertices of the rectangle. What percent larger is the area of the large semicircles than the area of the small semicircles? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
  "solution": "To find out how much larger the area of the larger semicircles is compared to the area of the smaller semicircles, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the radii of the semicircles\n\nThe rectangle dimensions are 6 meters (shorter side) and 10 meters (longer side). Semicircles are positioned on both shorter and longer sides.\n\n- For the shorter sides (6 meters), the diameter is 6 meters, giving the radius \\( r_{\\text{small}} \\):\n  \\[\n  r_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3 \\text{ meters}\n  \\]\n\n- For the longer sides (10 meters), the diameter is 10 meters, giving the radius \\( r_{\\text{large}} \\):\n  \\[\n  r_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\text{ meters}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the areas of the semicircles\n\nUsing the formula for the area of a semicircle \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2 \\):\n\n- **For the small semicircles**:\n  - Area of one small semicircle \\( A_{\\text{small}} \\):\n    \\[\n    A_{\\text{small}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (3^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (9) = \\frac{9}{2} \\pi \n    \\]\n  - Total area for two small semicircles:\n    \\[\n    A_{\\text{two small}} = 2 \\times A_{\\text{small}} = 2 \\times \\frac{9}{2} \\pi = 9 \\pi\n    \\]\n\n- **For the large semicircles**:\n  - Area of one large semicircle \\( A_{\\text{large}} \\):\n    \\[\n    A_{\\text{large}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (5^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (25) = \\frac{25}{2} \\pi\n    \\]\n  - Total area for two large semicircles:\n    \\[\n    A_{\\text{two large}} = 2 \\times A_{\\text{large}} = 2 \\times \\frac{25}{2} \\pi = 25 \\pi\n    \\]\n\n### Step 3: Compare the areas\n\nNext, we calculate the difference in areas between the larger and smaller semicircles:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = A_{\\text{two large}} - A_{\\text{two small}} = 25 \\pi - 9 \\pi = 16 \\pi\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the percent increase\n\nWe now determine the percent increase of the area of the large semicircles over the small semicircles:\n\\[\n\\text{Percent increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Difference}}{A_{\\text{two small}}} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{16 \\pi}{9 \\pi} \\right) \\times 100\\% \n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\text{Percent increase} = \\left( \\frac{16}{9} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 177.78\\%\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nRounding \\( 177.78\\% \\) gives us a final result of:\n\\[\n\\text{Rounded percent increase} = 178\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the larger semicircles is approximately **178% larger** than the area of the smaller semicircles.\n\nThe final answer is:  \n<ANSWER>178</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The two large semicircles together make a circle of radius 5, which has area $25\\pi$.  The two small circles together make a circle with radius 3, which has area $9\\pi$.  Therefore, the ratio of the large semicircles' area to the small semicircles' area is $\\frac{25\\pi}{9\\pi} = \\frac{25}{9} \\approx 2.78$.    Since the large semicircles have area 2.78 times the small semicircles, the large semicircles' area is $278\\%$ of the small semicircles' area, which is an increase of $278\\% - 100\\% = \\boxed{178\\%}$ over the small semicircles' area."
