  "problem": "A number in the set $\\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\\}$ is randomly selected. What is the probability that it is a two-digit number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To find the probability that a randomly selected number from the set \\(\\{50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 999\\}\\) is a two-digit number, we can follow these systematic steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Set Range**:\n   The numbers in the set range from 50 to 999.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Elements**:\n   We determine the total count of integers in this range using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total numbers} = \\text{Last number} - \\text{First number} + 1 = 999 - 50 + 1 = 950.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Count the Two-Digit Numbers**:\n   The two-digit numbers we are interested in are from 50 to 99. To find the total count of these numbers:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Two-digit numbers} = 99 - 50 + 1 = 50.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability**:\n   The probability of randomly selecting a two-digit number is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{two-digit number}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of two-digit numbers}}{\\text{Total numbers}} = \\frac{50}{950}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Fraction**:\n   We can simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{50}{950}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{50}{950} = \\frac{1}{19}.\n   \\]\n\nFinally, the probability that a randomly selected number from the set \\(\\{50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 999\\}\\) is a two-digit number is \\(\\frac{1}{19}\\).",
  "ground_truth": "To count the number of numbers in this set, we subtract 49 from all of the numbers, giving the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 950 \\}$, making it obvious that there are 950 numbers total. Furthermore, the set $\\{ 50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 98, 99 \\}$ corresponds to the more easily counted $\\{ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 49, 50 \\}$ by subtracting 49. So, the probability of selecting a two-digit number is $\\frac{50}{950} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{19}}$."
