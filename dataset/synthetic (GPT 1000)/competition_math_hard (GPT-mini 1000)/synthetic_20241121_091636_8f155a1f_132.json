  "solution": "To determine the number of equilateral triangles that can be formed using vertices from a hexagonal lattice, we will analyze the triangles based on their vertex arrangements.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Hexagonal Lattice\n\nIn a hexagonal lattice, each point has six nearest neighbors located one unit away. For example, considering the origin (0, 0), its nearest neighbors can be represented by the following coordinates:\n\n- (1, 0)\n- (1/2, \u221a3/2)\n- (-1/2, \u221a3/2)\n- (-1, 0)\n- (-1/2, -\u221a3/2)\n- (1/2, -\u221a3/2)\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Equilateral Triangles\n\n#### Equilateral Triangles with Side Length 1\nTriangles can be formed by selecting one vertex and its two adjacent neighbors. For any vertex in the lattice, we can generate triangles by considering the combinations of the vertex with its neighbors.\n\nFor instance, starting from the origin (0, 0):\n- One possible triangle is formed by the vertices: (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1/2, \u221a3/2).\n\nBy systematically rotating around each vertex, we can find that there are **6 distinct triangles** of side length 1.\n\n#### Equilateral Triangles with Side Length \u221a3\nFor triangles where the vertices are two units apart, we consider combinations that involve spacing vertices further apart. For example, starting with vertices (0, 0) and (1, 0), the third vertex would be selected from the positions around these points.\n\nBy exploring these configurations, we find that there are **2 distinct triangles** of side length \u221a3.\n\n### Step 3: Total Triangle Count\nNow, we combine the counts of the triangles from both cases:\n- Triangles with side length 1: 6\n- Triangles with side length \u221a3: 2\n\nAdding these gives us:\nTotal triangles = 6 (side length 1) + 2 (side length \u221a3) = **8 distinct equilateral triangles**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThus, the number of equilateral triangles with all vertices on the hexagonal lattice is:\n\n<ANSWER>8 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Number the points clockwise, beginning with the upper left as 1. Number the center point 7.\n\nWe can create six equilateral triangles with side length one: 176, 172, 273, 657, 574, and 473.\n\nWe can also create two equilateral triangles with side length $\\sqrt{3}$: 135 and 246.\n\nThus, there are $\\boxed{8}$ such equilateral triangles."
