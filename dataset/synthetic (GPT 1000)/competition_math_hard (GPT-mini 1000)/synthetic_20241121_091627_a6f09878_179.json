  "problem": "What is the ratio of the numerical value of the area, in square units, of an equilateral triangle of side length 8 units to the numerical value of its perimeter, in units? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.",
  "solution": "To determine the ratio of the area of an equilateral triangle with a side length of 8 units to its perimeter, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the perimeter\nThe perimeter \\( P \\) of an equilateral triangle is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nP = 3 \\times \\text{side length}\n\\]\nFor a triangle with a side length of 8 units:\n\\[\nP = 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\text{ units}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the area\nThe area \\( A \\) of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n\\]\nwhere \\( s \\) is the side length. Substituting \\( s = 8 \\):\n\\[\nA = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 8^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 64 = \\frac{64\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 16\\sqrt{3} \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the ratio of the area to the perimeter\nWe can now find the ratio of the area to the perimeter:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{A}{P} = \\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{24}\n\\]\nTo simplify, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 8:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{16\\sqrt{3} \\div 8}{24 \\div 8} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the ratio of the area of the triangle to its perimeter in simplest form is:\n\\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\)",
  "ground_truth": "Drawing an altitude of an equilateral triangle splits it into two 30-60-90 right triangles: [asy]\nunitsize(0.6inch);\npair A, B, C, F;\nA = (0,1);\nB = rotate(120)*A;\nC = rotate(120)*B;\nF = foot(A,B,C);\ndraw(A--B--C--A,linewidth(1));\ndraw(A--F);\n[/asy]\n\nThe altitude is the longer leg of each 30-60-90 triangle, and the hypotenuse of each 30-60-90 triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle, so the altitude's length is $\\sqrt{3}/2$ times the side length of the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the altitude of the equilateral triangle in the problem is $8(\\sqrt{3}/2) = 4\\sqrt{3}$, so the area of the equilateral triangle is $(8)(4\\sqrt{3})/2 = 16\\sqrt{3}$. The perimeter of the triangle is $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$. Thus, the ratio of area to perimeter is $\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{24}=\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}.$"
