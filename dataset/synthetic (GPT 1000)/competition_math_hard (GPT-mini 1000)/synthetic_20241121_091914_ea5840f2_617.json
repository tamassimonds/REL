  "problem": "A square has sides of length 10, and a circle centered at one of its vertices has radius 10.  What is the area of the union of the regions enclosed by the square and the circle? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
  "solution": "To find the area of the union of the regions enclosed by a square and a circle, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the area of the square.**\n   - The square has sides of length 10. \n   - The area \\( A_{square} \\) is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     A_{square} = \\text{side}^2 = 10^2 = 100.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the area of the circle.**\n   - The circle is centered at one of the square's vertices with a radius of 10. \n   - The area \\( A_{circle} \\) is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     A_{circle} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\times 10^2 = 100\\pi.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the area of the intersection between the square and the circle.**\n   - Since the radius of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, the circle will overlap with the square.\n   - The intersection of the square and circle can be regarded as a quarter of the circle, as the circle extends into the first quadrant from the bottom-left vertex of the square.\n   - The area of this quarter circle \\( A_{intersection} \\) is:\n     \\[\n     A_{intersection} = \\frac{1}{4} A_{circle} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 100\\pi = 25\\pi.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the union.**\n   - We use the formula for the area of the union:\n     \\[\n     A_{union} = A_{square} + A_{circle} - A_{intersection}.\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the previously calculated areas:\n     \\[\n     A_{union} = 100 + 100\\pi - 25\\pi = 100 + (100 - 25)\\pi = 100 + 75\\pi.\n     \\]\n\n5. **State the final answer.**\n   - The area of the union of the regions enclosed by the square and the circle is \\( 100 + 75\\pi \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>100 + 75\\pi</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The areas of the regions enclosed by the square and the circle are $10^{2}=100$ and $\\pi(10)^{2}= 100\\pi$, respectively. One quarter of the second region is also included in the first, so the area of the union is \\[\n100+ 100\\pi -25\\pi= \\boxed{100+75\\pi}.\n\\]"
