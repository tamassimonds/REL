  "problem": "A rhombus has sides of length 51 units each and a shorter diagonal of length 48 units. What is the length, in units, of the longer diagonal?",
  "solution": "To find the length of the longer diagonal of a rhombus given the lengths of its sides and the shorter diagonal, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand Rhombus Properties\nA rhombus has equal sides, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, forming four right triangles.\n\n### Step 2: Define Variables\nLet \\( d_1 \\) represent the length of the shorter diagonal, which is given as 48 units. Let \\( d_2 \\) be the length of the longer diagonal that we need to determine.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Diagonals to Right Triangles\nIn the right triangles formed by the diagonals:\n- Half of the shorter diagonal is \\( \\frac{d_1}{2} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24 \\) units.\n- Half of the longer diagonal is \\( \\frac{d_2}{2} \\).\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem for one of these triangles, we can write:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{d_1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{d_2}{2}\\right)^2 = (\\text{side length})^2\n\\]\nSubstituting in the known values:\n\\[\n(24)^2 + \\left(\\frac{d_2}{2}\\right)^2 = 51^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Squared Values\nCalculating the squares gives:\n\\[\n24^2 = 576 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 51^2 = 2601\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Substitute Values and Rearrange\nInsert these results into the equation:\n\\[\n576 + \\left(\\frac{d_2}{2}\\right)^2 = 2601\n\\]\nRearranging yields:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{d_2}{2}\\right)^2 = 2601 - 576\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{d_2}{2}\\right)^2 = 2025\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Solve for \\( \\frac{d_2}{2} \\)\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\n\\[\n\\frac{d_2}{2} = \\sqrt{2025} = 45\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Calculate the Length of \\( d_2 \\)\nMultiplying by 2 gives:\n\\[\nd_2 = 2 \\times 45 = 90\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe length of the longer diagonal of the rhombus is **90 units**.",
  "ground_truth": "The diagonals of a rhombus divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.  The legs of these right triangles are half as long as the diagonals of the rhombus.  Therefore, the sum of the squares of the half-diagonals of a rhombus is equal to the square of the side length.  Since one of the half-diagonals is $24$, the other half-diagonal is $\\sqrt{51^2-24^2}=3\\sqrt{17^2-8^2}=3\\cdot15=45$.  Therefore, the length of the missing diagonal is $45\\cdot 2=\\boxed{90}$ units."
