  "problem": "A license plate in a certain state consists of 4 digits, not necessarily distinct, and 2 letters, also not necessarily distinct. These six characters may appear in any order, except that the two letters must appear next to each other.  How many distinct license plates are possible?",
  "solution": "To determine the total number of distinct license plates in a given state where a license plate consists of 4 digits and 2 letters that must appear next to each other, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Treat Letters as a Block\nSince the two letters must be together, we treat them as a single block, denoted as \"LL.\" This means we are arranging the following components:\n\n- **1 block of letters (LL)**\n- **4 individual digits (D1, D2, D3, D4)**\n\nThis gives us a total of 5 components to arrange: LL, D1, D2, D3, D4.\n\n### Step 2: Arrange the Components\nThe number of ways to arrange these 5 components is calculated using factorial:\n\n\\[\n5! = 120\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Digit Combinations\nEach digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, which provides us with 10 options per digit. Therefore, the total combinations for the 4 digits is:\n\n\\[\n10^4 = 10000\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Letter Combinations\nEach of the 2 letters can be any letter from A to Z, giving us 26 options per letter. Thus, the total combinations for the 2 letters is:\n\n\\[\n26^2 = 676\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Combine All Components\nTo find the total number of distinct license plates, we multiply the number of arrangements, the number of digit combinations, and the number of letter combinations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total License Plates} = (\\text{arrangements}) \\times (\\text{digit combinations}) \\times (\\text{letter combinations})\n\\]\n\\[\n= 120 \\times 10000 \\times 676\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Total\nFirst, calculate \\(120 \\times 10000\\):\n\n\\[\n120 \\times 10000 = 1200000\n\\]\n\nNext, multiply by \\(676\\):\n\n\\[\n1200000 \\times 676 = 811200000\n\\]\n\n### Reassess the Letter Placement\nHowever, recognizing that the \"LL\" block can occupy 5 different positions in the sequence of 5 characters (the 4 digits plus the block of letters), we realize we need to account for these 5 possible placements. Thus, the calculation for the total distinct license plates is actually:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total License Plates} = 5 \\times (10^4) \\times (26^2)\n\\]\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n1. **Positions for the letter block:** 5 choices for where to place \"LL.\"\n2. **Digit combinations:** \\(10^4 = 10000\\)\n3. **Letter combinations:** \\(26^2 = 676\\)\n\nPutting this all together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total License Plates} = 5 \\times 10000 \\times 676\n\\]\n\\[\n= 5 \\times 676000 = 3380000\n\\]\n\nThus, the final count of distinct license plates is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{33800000}\n\\] \n\nThis summary leads us to the corrected total of 33,800,000 distinct license plates possible, ensuring all calculations and arrangements have been accurately accounted for.",
  "ground_truth": "Since the two letters have to be next to each other, think of them as forming a two-letter word $w$. So each license plate consists of 4 digits and $w$. For each digit there are 10 choices. There are $26\\cdot 26$ choices for the letters of $w$, and  there are 5 choices for the position of $w$. So the total number of distinct license plates is $5\\cdot10^4\\cdot26^2 = \\boxed{33,\\!800,\\!000}$."
