  "problem": "Let $z$ be a complex number such that $|z| = 2.$  Find the largest possible distance between $(3 + 4i)z^3$ and $z^5$ when plotted in the complex plane.",
  "solution": "We want to find the maximum distance between the complex expressions \\((3 + 4i)z^3\\) and \\(z^5\\) for a complex number \\(z\\) with a magnitude of \\(|z| = 2\\). We'll denote this distance as \\(D\\):\n\n\\[\nD = |(3 + 4i)z^3 - z^5| \n\\]\n\nFirst, we factor out \\(z^3\\):\n\n\\[\nD = |z^3((3 + 4i) - z^2)|\n\\]\n\nSince \\(|z| = 2\\), we know that:\n\n\\[\n|z^3| = |z|^3 = 2^3 = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, we can express \\(D\\) in terms of \\(|(3 + 4i) - z^2|\\):\n\n\\[\nD = 8 |(3 + 4i) - z^2|\n\\]\n\nNext, we analyze \\(|(3 + 4i) - z^2|\\). Since \\(|z| = 2\\), it follows that:\n\n\\[\n|z^2| = |z|^2 = 2^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nWe can represent \\(z^2\\) as \\(z^2 = re^{i\\theta}\\) where \\(r = 4\\). In rectangular coordinates, \\(z^2\\) can be expressed as \\(z^2 = 4(\\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta)\\).\n\nNow, we calculate the modulus:\n\n\\[\n|(3 + 4i) - z^2| = |(3 - 4\\cos\\theta) + (4 - 4\\sin\\theta)i|\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(D\\), we apply the distance formula:\n\n\\[\nD = \\sqrt{(3 - 4\\cos\\theta)^2 + (4 - 4\\sin\\theta)^2}\n\\]\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n\\[\nD = \\sqrt{(3 - 4\\cos\\theta)^2 + (16 - 32\\sin\\theta + 16\\sin^2\\theta)}\n\\]\n\nNext, we recognize that \\(3 + 4i\\) is a fixed point in the complex plane, and \\(z^2\\) lies on a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin. To maximize \\(|(3 + 4i) - z^2|\\), we need the point \\(z^2\\) to be as far away from \\(3 + 4i\\) as possible, which occurs when it is directly opposite \\(3 + 4i\\) relative to the origin.\n\nThe distance from the origin to \\(3 + 4i\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n|3 + 4i| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum distance between \\(z^2\\) on its circle (which is 4 from the origin) and \\(3 + 4i\\) would be:\n\n\\[\n5 + 4 = 9\n\\]\n\nNow, incorporating this back into our expression for \\(D\\):\n\n\\[\nD = 8 \\times 9 = 72\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the largest possible distance between \\((3 + 4i)z^3\\) and \\(z^5\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{72}\n\\]",
