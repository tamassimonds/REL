  "problem": "If $f(x)=f(2-x)$ for all $x$, then what line is necessarily an axis of symmetry of the graph of $y=f(x)$? (Give the simplest equation of this line.)",
  "solution": "To determine the axis of symmetry for the function \\( y = f(x) \\) given the relationship \\( f(x) = f(2 - x) \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Symmetry Condition\nThe equation \\( f(x) = f(2 - x) \\) indicates that for any value \\( x \\), the function yields the same output at points \\( x \\) and \\( 2 - x \\). This suggests a reflective symmetry about a certain line.\n\n### Step 2: Consider Symmetrical Points\nLet's denote a point on the graph as \\( x = a \\). According to our condition, we have:\n\\[\nf(a) = f(2 - a)\n\\]\nThis means that the function's values are identical at the points \\( a \\) and \\( 2 - a \\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Midpoint\nTo identify where this symmetry occurs, we can find the midpoint between the two points \\( a \\) and \\( 2 - a \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Midpoint} = \\frac{a + (2 - a)}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\n\\]\nThis calculation shows that the midpoint for any pair \\( a \\) and \\( 2 - a \\) is consistently at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Conclude on Symmetry\nSince this relationship holds for all values of \\( a \\), indicating that the function is symmetric around the midpoint \\( x = 1 \\), we conclude that the graph of \\( f(x) \\) is symmetric about the vertical line \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the axis of symmetry for the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) is given by the equation:\n<ANSWER> x = 1 </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "For every point $(x,y)$ on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we know $(2-x,y)$ is also on the graph of $y=f(x)$.\n\nWe have $x = 1+(x-1)$ and $2-x = 1-(x-1)$, so the geometric transformation which takes $(x,y)$ to $(2-x,y)$ is reflection across the vertical line $\\boxed{x=1}$."
