  "problem": "What is the domain of the function $$f(t) = \\frac{1}{(t-1)^2+(t+1)^2}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.",
  "solution": "To determine the domain of the function \n\n\\[\nf(t) = \\frac{1}{(t-1)^2 + (t+1)^2,\n\\]\n\nwe need to consider the expression in the denominator:\n\n\\[\n(t-1)^2 + (t+1)^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Expand the Denominator\n\nWe first expand the square terms:\n\n\\[\n(t-1)^2 = t^2 - 2t + 1,\n\\]\n\\[\n(t+1)^2 = t^2 + 2t + 1.\n\\]\n\nNow, we add these two results together:\n\n\\[\n(t-1)^2 + (t+1)^2 = (t^2 - 2t + 1) + (t^2 + 2t + 1).\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Combine Like Terms\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n\\[\n(t-1)^2 + (t+1)^2 = t^2 - 2t + 1 + t^2 + 2t + 1 = 2t^2 + 2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Denominator\n\nNow, we can rewrite the function as:\n\n\\[\nf(t) = \\frac{1}{2t^2 + 2}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to check when the denominator equals zero, as this determines where the function is undefined.\n\n### Step 4: Set the Denominator to Zero\n\nWe set the denominator equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n2t^2 + 2 = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Solve for \\(t\\)\n\nDividing the equation by 2, we simplify it to:\n\n\\[\nt^2 + 1 = 0.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(t\\), we find:\n\n\\[\nt^2 = -1.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Consider the Implications\n\nThe equation \\(t^2 = -1\\) has no real solutions because there are no real numbers whose square is negative. Consequently, the expression \\(2t^2 + 2\\) is always positive for all real values of \\(t\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the denominator is never zero for any real number \\(t\\), the function \\(f(t)\\) is defined for all real numbers. Thus, the domain of \\(f\\) is all real numbers, which we can express in interval notation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Domain of } f(t) = (-\\infty, \\infty).\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\text{The domain of } f(t) \\text{ is } \\boxed{(-\\infty, \\infty)}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The fraction $\\frac{1}{(t-1)^2+(t+1)^2}$ fails to be defined only if the denominator is zero. But $(t-1)^2$ and $(t+1)^2$ are both nonnegative for all $t$, and are never simultaneously $0$, so their sum is always positive (and, specifically, nonzero). Therefore, the domain of $f(t)$ is all real numbers or, in interval notation, $\\boxed{(-\\infty,\\infty)}$."
