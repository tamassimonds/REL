  "problem": "How many positive perfect square integers are factors of the product $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of positive perfect square factors of the product \\( (2^{10})(3^{12})(5^{15}) \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identifying Factor Forms**: \n   A factor of the product can be expressed in the form \\( 2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c \\), where \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\) must be non-negative integers. For the factor to be a perfect square, \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\) must all be even integers.\n\n2. **Determining Possible Exponents**: \n   - For \\( 2^{10} \\), the possible even values for \\( a \\) are \\( 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 \\), giving us **6 choices**.\n   - For \\( 3^{12} \\), the possible even values for \\( b \\) are \\( 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 \\), providing **7 choices**.\n   - For \\( 5^{15} \\), the possible even values for \\( c \\) are \\( 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 \\), resulting in **8 choices**.\n\n3. **Calculating Total Combinations**: \n   To find the total number of positive perfect square factors, we multiply the number of choices for each exponent:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total perfect square factors} = (6 \\text{ choices for } a) \\times (7 \\text{ choices for } b) \\times (8 \\text{ choices for } c)\n   \\]\n   This results in:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 7 \\times 8\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: \n   We perform the multiplication:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 7 = 42\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   42 \\times 8 = 336\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the total number of positive perfect square integers that are factors of the product \\( (2^{10})(3^{12})(5^{15}) \\) is \\( 336 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>336 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "There are six possible square powers of two that can divide the given number: $2^0$, $2^2$, $2^4$, $2^6$, $2^8$, and $2^{10}$. Similarly, there are seven possible square powers of three that can divide the given number, and eight possible square powers of five that can divide the given number. Therefore, there are $6 \\times 7 \\times 8 = \\boxed{336}$ positive perfect square integers that can divide $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$."
