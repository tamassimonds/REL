  "problem": "In a right triangle with integer length sides, the hypotenuse has length 39 units. How many units is the length of the shorter leg?",
  "solution": "To find the length of the shorter leg of a right triangle with integer side lengths and a hypotenuse of 39 units, we'll use the Pythagorean theorem, which states:\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the legs of the triangle. We'll assume \\( a \\leq b \\).\n\n1. **Identify the hypotenuse**: Here, the hypotenuse \\( c = 39 \\).\n\n2. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem**: We express the equation as:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + b^2 = 39^2\n   \\]\n   Calculating \\( 39^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   39^2 = 1521\n   \\]\n   Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + b^2 = 1521\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\)**: Since we assumed \\( b \\) is the longer leg, we can write:\n   \\[\n   b^2 = 1521 - a^2\n   \\]\n   For \\( b \\) to be an integer, \\( 1521 - a^2 \\) must be a perfect square.\n\n4. **Set bounds for \\( a \\)**: The maximum for \\( a \\) is less than 39, meaning \\( a \\) can range from \\( 1 \\) to \\( 38 \\).\n\n5. **Check for integer pairs**: We will iterate integer values of \\( a \\) to see if \\( 1521 - a^2 \\) results in a perfect square:\n\n   - For example:\n     - \\( a = 1 \\): \\( b^2 = 1520 \\quad \\text{(not a perfect square)} \\)\n     - \\( a = 2 \\): \\( b^2 = 1517 \\quad \\text{(not a perfect square)} \\)\n     - \\( a = 3 \\): \\( b^2 = 1512 \\quad \\text{(not a perfect square)} \\)\n     - Continuing this process...\n\n   Eventually, we find:\n   - For \\( a = 15 \\):\n     \\[\n     b^2 = 1521 - 15^2 = 1521 - 225 = 1296\n     \\]\n     Here, \\( b = \\sqrt{1296} = 36 \\) (which is a perfect square).\n\n6. **Verify the solution**: We check the calculated values \\( a = 15 \\) and \\( b = 36 \\):\n   \\[\n   15^2 + 36^2 = 225 + 1296 = 1521\n   \\]\n   This confirms the relationship holds true.\n\nThus, the length of the shorter leg of the triangle is:\n\n<ANSWER>15</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since they only ask for one length, you can assume that there's only one possible triangle.  Then, quickly note that $39 = 3\\cdot 13$, and that 5 - 12 - 13 is a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the shorter leg has length $\\boxed{15}$."
