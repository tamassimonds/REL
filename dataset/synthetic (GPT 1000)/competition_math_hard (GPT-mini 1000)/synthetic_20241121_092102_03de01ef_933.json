  "problem": "When the decimal point of a certain positive decimal number is moved four places to the right, the new number is four times the reciprocal of the original number. What is the original number?",
  "solution": "Let's denote the original positive decimal number as \\( x \\).\n\nWhen we move the decimal point of \\( x \\) four places to the right, it becomes \\( 10,000x \\). The problem states that this new number \\( 10,000x \\) is equal to four times the reciprocal of the original number \\( x \\). The reciprocal of \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\), so four times the reciprocal is expressed as \\( 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{4}{x} \\).\n\nFrom this information, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n10,000x = \\frac{4}{x}\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n10,000x^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we can isolate \\( x^2 \\) by dividing both sides by 10,000:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{4}{10,000}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction on the right gives us:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{4}{10,000} = \\frac{1}{2,500}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2,500}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2,500}} = \\frac{1}{50}\n\\]\n\nThus, the original number \\( x \\) is:\n\n\\[\nx = 0.02\n\\]\n\nIn conclusion, the solution to the problem is:\n\n<ANSWER>0.02 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "If $x$ is the number, then moving the decimal point four places to the right is the same as multiplying $x$ by $10{,}000$. That is, $10{,}000x = 4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$, which is equivalent to $x^2 = 4/10{,}000$. Since $x$ is positive, it follows that $x = 2/100 = \\boxed{0.02}$."
