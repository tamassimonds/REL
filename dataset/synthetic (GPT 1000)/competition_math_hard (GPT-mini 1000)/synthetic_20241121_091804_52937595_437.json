  "problem": "Ramanujan and Hardy played a game where they both picked a complex number. If the product of their numbers was $32-8i$, and Hardy picked $5+3i$, what number did Ramanujan pick?",
  "solution": "To find the complex number that Ramanujan picked, let\u2019s denote Hardy's number as \\( H = 5 + 3i \\) and Ramanujan's number as \\( R \\). We know from the problem that the product of their numbers can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nH \\cdot R = 32 - 8i\n\\]\n\nTo isolate \\( R \\), we rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{32 - 8i}{H}\n\\]\n\nNext, we substitute in Hardy's number:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{32 - 8i}{5 + 3i}\n\\]\n\nTo perform this division, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, \\( 5 - 3i \\):\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{(32 - 8i)(5 - 3i)}{(5 + 3i)(5 - 3i)}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n(5 + 3i)(5 - 3i) = 5^2 - (3i)^2 = 25 - 9(-1) = 25 + 9 = 34\n\\]\n\nNow, we compute the numerator using the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\n\\[\n(32 - 8i)(5 - 3i) = 32 \\cdot 5 + 32 \\cdot (-3i) - 8i \\cdot 5 - 8i \\cdot (-3i)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n160 - 96i - 40i + 24i^2\n\\]\n\nSince \\( i^2 = -1 \\), we substitute to find:\n\n\\[\n24i^2 = 24(-1) = -24\n\\]\n\nCombining all the terms gives us:\n\n\\[\n160 - 96i - 40i - 24 = 160 - 24 - 136i = 136 - 136i\n\\]\n\nNow we can substitute this back into our formula for \\( R \\):\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{136 - 136i}{34}\n\\]\n\nTo simplify, we divide both the real and imaginary parts by 34:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{136}{34} - \\frac{136i}{34} = 4 - 4i\n\\]\n\nThus, the complex number that Ramanujan picked is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4 - 4i}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let Hardy's number be $h$ and Ramanujan's be $r$. We have the equations: \\begin{align*}\nrh&=32-8i,\\\\\nh&=5+3i.\n\\end{align*} Thus, \\[r=\\frac{32-8i}{5+3i}.\\] Multiplying top and bottom by the conjugate of $5+3i$, we have \\[r=\\frac{(32-8i)(5-3i)}{34}\\] or  \\[r=\\frac{136-136i}{34}=\\boxed{4-4i}\\]"
