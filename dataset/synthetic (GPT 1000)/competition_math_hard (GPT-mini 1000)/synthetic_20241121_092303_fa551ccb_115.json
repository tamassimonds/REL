  "problem": "What is the greatest integer less than 100 for which the greatest common factor of that integer and 18 is 3?",
  "solution": "To determine the greatest integer less than 100 for which the greatest common factor (GCF) with 18 is 3, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need an integer \\( n < 100 \\) such that \\( \\text{GCF}(n, 18) = 3 \\).\n\n2. **Factorization of 18**: The prime factorization of 18 is:\n   \\[\n   18 = 2 \\times 3^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the factors of 18 include 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\n3. **Conditions for GCF**: To satisfy \\( \\text{GCF}(n, 18) = 3 \\):\n   - \\( n \\) must be divisible by 3 (since 3 is a common factor).\n   - \\( n \\) must not be divisible by 2 (to prevent the GCF from being at least 6).\n   - \\( n \\) must not be divisible by 9 (to ensure the GCF remains 3).\n\n4. **Finding a Suitable Form for \\( n \\)**: Since \\( n \\) must be divisible by 3 and not by 2 or 9, we express \\( n \\) as:\n   \\[\n   n = 3k\n   \\]\n   where \\( k \\) is an integer that is odd and not a multiple of 3.\n\n5. **Determining the Maximum Value for \\( n \\)**: We require \\( n < 100 \\):\n   \\[\n   3k < 100 \\implies k < \\frac{100}{3} \\approx 33.33\n   \\]\n   Hence, the largest integer \\( k \\) that is less than or equal to 33 is 33. We must ensure \\( k \\) is odd.\n\n6. **Finding the Largest Eligible Odd \\( k \\)**: The largest odd integer less than or equal to 33 is 33. However, if we compute:\n   \\[\n   n = 3 \\times 33 = 99\n   \\]\n   But since 99 is divisible by 9, we need to check the next lower odd integers.\n\n7. **Checking Next Eligible Odd Integers**:\n   - For \\( k = 31 \\):\n     \\[\n     n = 3 \\times 31 = 93\n     \\]\n     Checking \\( \\text{GCF}(93, 18) \\):\n     - The prime factorization of 93 is:\n     \\[\n     93 = 3 \\times 31\n     \\]\n     The common factors of 93 and 18 are \\( 1 \\) and \\( 3 \\), so:\n     \\[\n     \\text{GCF}(93, 18) = 3\n     \\]\n   - Next, for \\( k = 29 \\):\n     \\[\n     n = 3 \\times 29 = 87\n     \\]\n     Checking \\( \\text{GCF}(87, 18) \\):\n     - The prime factorization of 87 is:\n     \\[\n     87 = 3 \\times 29\n     \\]\n     The GCF remains 3.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Among the candidates we checked, the largest integer less than 100 that meets the criteria is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{93}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The prime factors of 18 are 2, 3, and 3. If the greatest common factor with 18 is 3, that means the other number is a multiple of 3 but not 2, 6, or 9. Since the other number cannot be an even number (multiple of 2), we start with 99 and look at decreasing odd numbers. 99 is a multiple of 9, 97 and 95 are not multiples of 3, so the greatest integer less than 100 that satisfies the conditions is $\\boxed{93}$."
