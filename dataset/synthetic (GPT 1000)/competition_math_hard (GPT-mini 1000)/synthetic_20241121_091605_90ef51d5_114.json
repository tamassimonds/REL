  "problem": "Two farmers agree that pigs are worth $\\$300$ and that goats are worth $\\$210$. When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with ``change'' received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary. (For example, a $\\$390$ debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way?",
  "solution": "To determine the smallest positive debt that can be settled using pigs valued at $300 each and goats valued at $210 each, we want to find the smallest positive integer amount that can be represented as a linear combination of these two values. \n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Values**:\n   - The value of a pig = $300\n   - The value of a goat = $210\n\n2. **Formulation**:\n   - We express the debt as a linear combination of pigs and goats: \\(300x + 210y = D\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers and \\(D\\) is the total debt.\n\n3. **Finding the Smallest Positive \\(D\\)**:\n   - The smallest positive value of \\(D\\) that can be formed this way is equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $300$ and $210$.\n\n4. **Calculate the GCD**:\n   - We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:\n     \\[\n     300 = 210 \\times 1 + 90\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     210 = 90 \\times 2 + 30\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     90 = 30 \\times 3 + 0\n     \\]\n   - The last non-zero remainder is $30$, which is the GCD of the two values.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, the smallest positive debt that can be settled using any combination of pigs and goats is \\(D = 30\\).\n\nIn summary, the smallest positive debt that can be resolved is: \n<30> solution</30>",
  "ground_truth": "If a debt of $D$ dollars can be resolved in this way, then integers $p$ and $g$ must exist with \\[\nD = 300p + 210g = 30(10p + 7g).\n\\]As a consequence, $D$ must be a multiple of 30, and  no positive debt less than $\\$30$ can be resolved. A debt of  $\\boxed{\\$30}$  can be resolved since \\[\n30 = 300(-2) + 210(3).\n\\]This is  done by giving 3 goats and receiving 2 pigs."
