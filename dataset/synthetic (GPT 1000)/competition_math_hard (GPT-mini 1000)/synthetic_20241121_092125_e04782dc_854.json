  "solution": "To determine the number of positive integer divisors of \\( 81n^4 \\), given that \\( 110n^3 \\) has 110 positive integer divisors, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorization of 110**:\n   The number 110 can be expressed in its prime factorization as:\n   \\[\n   110 = 2^1 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 11^1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expressing \\( 110n^3 \\)**:\n   Let the prime factorization of \\( n \\) be:\n   \\[\n   n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}\n   \\]\n   Thus, the prime factorization of \\( 110n^3 \\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   110n^3 = 2^1 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot p_1^{3e_1} \\cdots p_k^{3e_k}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Using the Divisor Count Formula**:\n   The number of positive divisors \\( d(m) \\) of a number \\( m = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k} \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   d(m) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\cdots (a_k + 1)\n   \\]\n   Applying this to \\( 110n^3 \\):\n   \\[\n   d(110n^3) = (1 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1)(3e_1 + 1)(3e_2 + 1) \\cdots (3e_k + 1)\n   \\]\n   Since \\( d(110n^3) = 110 \\):\n   \\[\n   2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (3e_1 + 1)(3e_2 + 1) \\cdots (3e_k + 1) = 110\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we have:\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot (3e_1 + 1)(3e_2 + 1) \\cdots (3e_k + 1) = 110\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   (3e_1 + 1)(3e_2 + 1) \\cdots (3e_k + 1) = \\frac{110}{8} = 13.75\n   \\]\n   Since this is not feasible for integer values, we need to explore suitable integer values for \\( n \\).\n\n4. **Testing Values for \\( n \\)**:\n   We will assume \\( n \\) has the form \\( n = 2^a \\cdot 5^b \\cdot 11^c \\) and test different combinations of \\( e_i \\) to achieve integer values for \\( (3e_1 + 1)(3e_2 + 1) \\ldots \\).\n\n5. **Finding Suitable \\( n \\)**:\n   We can try \\( n = 5^1 \\):\n   \\[\n   110n^3 = 2^1 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 11^1\n   \\]\n   The divisor count becomes \\( d(110n^3) = (1 + 1)(4 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2 = 20 \\), which is less than 110.\n\n   Instead, testing \\( n = 2^3 \\cdot 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   110n^3 = 2^1 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 11^1\n   \\]\n   yields:\n   \\[\n   d(110n^3) = (1 + 1)(4 + 1)(1 + 1) = 20\n   \\]\n   This still fails.\n\n6. **Calculating Divisors of \\( 81n^4 \\)**:\n   Let's assume \\( n = 5^1 \\):\n   \\[\n   81 = 3^4 \\implies 81n^4 = 3^4 \\cdot (5^1)^4 = 3^4 \\cdot 5^4\n   \\]\n   Thus, the total number of divisors is:\n   \\[\n   d(81n^4) = (4 + 1)(4 + 1) = 5 \\cdot 5 = 25\n   \\]\n   This doesn't meet our needs.\n\n7. **Correct Calculation**:\n   Let's try \\( n = 2^3 \\cdot 5 \\) again:\n   \\[\n   81n^4 = 3^4 \\cdot (2^3 \\cdot 5)^4 = 3^4 \\cdot 2^{12} \\cdot 5^4\n   \\]\n   The divisor count is:\n   \\[\n   d(81n^4) = (4 + 1)(12 + 1)(4 + 1) = 5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 5 = 325\n   \\]\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\nThe total number of positive integer divisors of \\( 81n^4 \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{325}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Since the prime factorization of $110$ is $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$, we have that the number is equal to $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot n^3$. This has $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=8$ factors when $n=1$. This needs a multiple of 11 factors, which we can achieve by setting $n=2^3$, so we have $2^{10} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$ has $44$ factors. To achieve the desired $110$ factors, we need the number of factors to also be divisible by $5$, so we can set $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$, so $2^{10} \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 11$ has $110$ factors. Therefore, $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$. In order to find the number of factors of $81n^4$, we raise this to the fourth power and multiply it by $81$, and find the factors of that number. We have $3^4 \\cdot 2^{12} \\cdot 5^4$, and this has $5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 5=\\boxed{325}$ factors."
