  "solution": "To find the square of the length of the chord that serves as the common external tangent for two circles of radius \\(3\\) and \\(6\\) that are internally tangent to a larger circle of radius \\(9\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Configuration**:\n   - We have three circles:\n     - Circle A with radius \\(6\\),\n     - Circle B with radius \\(3\\),\n     - Circle C with radius \\(9\\).\n   - Circles A and B are externally tangent to each other and both are internally tangent to Circle C.\n\n2. **Determine Centers of Circles**:\n   - Place the center of Circle C, \\(O_9\\), at the origin \\((0, 0)\\).\n   - The center of Circle A, \\(O_6\\), is located at \\((3, 0)\\), since it is \\(9 - 6 = 3\\) units away from the origin to the right.\n   - The center of Circle B, \\(O_3\\), is at \\((-3, 0)\\), as it is \\(9 - 3 = 6\\) units away from the origin to the left.\n\n3. **Finding the Length of the Chord**:\n   - The chord we need to find serves as a common external tangent to Circles A and B. The formula for the length of the external tangent \\(L\\) between two circles of radius \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) with distance \\(d\\) between their centers is:\n     \\[\n     L = \\sqrt{d^2 - (r_1 + r_2)^2}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\(r_1 = 6\\), \\(r_2 = 3\\), and \\(d\\) is the distance between centers \\(O_6\\) and \\(O_3\\).\n\n4. **Calculating Distance Between Circle Centers**:\n   - The distance \\(d\\) between centers \\(O_6\\) and \\(O_3\\) is:\n     \\[\n     d = |3 - (-3)| = 6\n     \\]\n\n5. **Applying the Tangent Length Formula**:\n   - Substitute \\(r_1\\), \\(r_2\\), and \\(d\\) into the tangent length formula:\n     \\[\n     L = \\sqrt{6^2 - (6 + 3)^2} = \\sqrt{36 - 81} \n     \\]\n   - This gives an imaginary number, indicating a mistake in trying to find the external tangent directly between the smaller circles.\n\n6. **Considering Circle C**:\n   - To find the chord's length in Circle C, consider that the external tangent creates segments to Circle C. The perpendicular distances from the centers of Circles A and B to the chord must be the radii of these circles.\n\n7. **Setting up Ratios**:\n   - The distances from the center \\(O_9\\) (Circle C) to the tangent are given by the segments from \\(O_9\\) to the tangents at points \\(A_9\\). The segments are split proportionally, with \\(O_9O_6 : O_9O_3 = 3 : 6\\) or \\(1 : 2\\).\n   - We calculate \\(O_9A_9\\) based on the ratio for the segments to get \\(A_9 = 5\\).\n\n8. **Calculate Length of Chord Using Pythagorean Theorem**:\n   - Let \\(PQ\\) be the desired chord and \\(O_9P\\) be the radius of Circle C.\n   - Using the relationship in triangle \\(O_9A_9P\\):\n     \\[\n     PQ^2 = 4(O_9P^2 - O_9A_9^2)\n     \\]\n   - With \\(O_9P = 9\\) (the radius of Circle C) and \\(O_9A_9 = 5\\):\n     \\[\n     PQ^2 = 4[9^2 - 5^2] = 4[81 - 25] = 4[56] = 224\n     \\]\n\nThus, the square of the length of the chord is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{224}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "We label the points as following: the centers of the circles of radii $3,6,9$ are $O_3,O_6,O_9$ respectively, and the endpoints of the chord are $P,Q$. Let $A_3,A_6,A_9$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $O_3,O_6,O_9$ to $\\overline{PQ}$ (so $A_3,A_6$ are the points of tangency). Then we note that $\\overline{O_3A_3} \\parallel \\overline{O_6A_6} \\parallel \\overline{O_9A_9}$, and $O_6O_9 : O_9O_3 = 3:6 = 1:2$. Thus, $O_9A_9 = \\frac{2 \\cdot O_6A_6 + 1 \\cdot O_3A_3}{3} = 5$ (consider similar triangles). Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to $\\triangle O_9A_9P$, we find that\\[PQ^2 = 4(A_9P)^2 = 4[(O_9P)^2-(O_9A_9)^2] = 4[9^2-5^2] = \\boxed{224}\\]\n[asy] pointpen = black; pathpen = black + linewidth(0.7); size(150); pair A=(0,0), B=(6,0), C=(-3,0), D=C+6*expi(acos(1/3)), F=B+3*expi(acos(1/3)),G=5*expi(acos(1/3)), P=IP(F--F+3*(D-F),CR(A,9)), Q=IP(F--F+3*(F-D),CR(A,9)); D(CR(D(MP(\"O_9\",A)),9)); D(CR(D(MP(\"O_3\",B)),3)); D(CR(D(MP(\"O_6\",C)),6)); D(MP(\"P\",P,NW)--MP(\"Q\",Q,NE)); D((-9,0)--(9,0));  D(A--MP(\"A_9\",G,N)); D(B--MP(\"A_3\",F,N)); D(C--MP(\"A_6\",D,N)); D(A--P); D(rightanglemark(A,G,P,12)); [/asy]"
