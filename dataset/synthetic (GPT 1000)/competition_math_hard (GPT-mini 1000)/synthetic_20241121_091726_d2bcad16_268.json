  "problem": "Joel selected an acute angle $x$ (strictly between 0 and 90 degrees) and wrote the values of $\\sin x$, $\\cos x$, and $\\tan x$ on three different cards.  Then he gave those cards to three students, Malvina, Paulina, and Georgina, one card to each, and asked them to figure out which trigonometric function (sin, cos, or tan) produced their cards.  Even after sharing the values on their cards with each other, only Malvina was able to surely identify which function produced the value on her card.  Compute the sum of all possible values that Joel wrote on Malvina's card.",
  "solution": "To determine the possible values on Malvina's card and calculate their sum, let's break down the problem into clear steps.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Functions\nFor an acute angle \\( x \\):\n- We have three trigonometric functions: \\( \\sin x \\), \\( \\cos x \\), and \\( \\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x} \\). \n- All three values are positive since \\( x \\) lies between 0 and 90 degrees.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Malvina's Unique Value\nMalvina can uniquely identify her card's value, which means her value must be distinct enough from the other two values.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Potential Values for Malvina\n1. **If Malvina has \\( \\sin x \\)**:\n   - Paulina could have \\( \\cos x \\) or \\( \\tan x \\), leading to potential ambiguity since both values can be numerically close.\n\n2. **If Malvina has \\( \\cos x \\)**:\n   - Similar reasoning applies; it could also create confusion with \\( \\sin x \\) or \\( \\tan x \\).\n\n3. **If Malvina has \\( \\tan x \\)**:\n   - Here, knowing \\( \\tan x \\) provides a clear relationship with both \\( \\sin x \\) and \\( \\cos x \\), making it easy for her to differentiate her value.\n\n**Conclusion**: Malvina's most likely value is \\( \\tan x \\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding Specific Values\n1. **Case when \\( \\tan x = 1 \\)**:\n   - This occurs at \\( x = 45^\\circ \\), yielding \\( \\sin 45^\\circ = \\cos 45^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\). Thus, Malvina would have the value of 1.\n\n2. **Exploring \\( \\sin x = \\tan x \\)**:\n   - This leads to \\( \\sin x(1 - \\cos x) = 0 \\), which doesn't yield new solutions in the acute range.\n\n3. **Exploring \\( \\cos x = \\tan x \\)**:\n   - This gives \\( \\cos^2 x = \\sin x \\).\n   - Substituting \\( \\sin x = 1 - \\cos^2 x \\) leads to the equation \\( \\sin^2 x + \\sin x - 1 = 0 \\).\n   - Using the quadratic formula, we find \\( \\sin x = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\) (the positive solution).\n\n### Step 5: Summing the Values\nFrom our analysis:\n- One value is \\( 1 \\) (from \\( \\tan x = 1 \\)).\n- The other value is \\( \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\).\n\nAdding these yields:\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The functions $\\sin x,$ $\\cos x,$ $\\tan x$ are one-to-one on the interval $(0^\\circ,90^\\circ).$  Since Malvina could deduce her function, the value of $x$ can also be deduced.  In particular, $\\sin x,$ $\\cos x,$ and $\\tan x$ are all known.  Since they cannot deduce Paulina's function and Georgina's function, their values must be equal.\n\nIf $\\sin x = \\cos x,$ then $\\tan x = 1,$ so $x = 45^\\circ.$  Then Malvina's value is 1.\n\nIf $\\sin x = \\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x},$ then $\\cos x = 1.$  But $\\cos x$ cannot achieve 1 on the interval $(0^\\circ,90^\\circ).$\n\nIf $\\cos x = \\tan x = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x},$ then $\\sin x = \\cos^2 x = 1 - \\sin^2 x.$  Then\n\\[\\sin^2 x + \\sin x - 1 = 0.\\]By the quadratic formula,\n\\[\\sin x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}.\\]Since $-1 \\le \\sin x \\le 1,$\n\\[\\sin x = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.\\]This is the case where $\\cos x = \\tan x,$ so Malvina's value is $\\sin x = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the possible numbers on Malvina's card is\n\\[1 + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}}.\\]"
