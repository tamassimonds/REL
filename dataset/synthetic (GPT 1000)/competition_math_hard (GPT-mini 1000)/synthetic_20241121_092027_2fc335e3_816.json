  "problem": "A rectangular band formation is a formation with $m$ band members in each of $r$ rows, where $m$ and $r$ are integers. A particular band has less than 100 band members. The director arranges them in a rectangular formation and finds that he has two members left over. If he increases the number of members in each row by 1 and reduces the number of rows by 2, there are exactly enough places in the new formation for each band member. What is the largest number of members the band could have?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we denote the total number of band members as \\( N \\). We have two main conditions based on the arrangement of the members:\n\n1. When arranged in rows of \\( m \\) members each and \\( r \\) rows, there are 2 members left over:\n   \\[\n   N = mr + 2.\n   \\]\n\n2. If the number of members per row \\( m \\) is increased by 1 (to \\( m + 1 \\)) and the number of rows is decreased by 2 (to \\( r - 2 \\)), then the members fit perfectly:\n   \\[\n   N = (m + 1)(r - 2).\n   \\]\n\nWe can set these two equations equal to each other:\n\\[\nmr + 2 = (m + 1)(r - 2).\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand the right side:\n\\[\nmr + 2 = mr - 2m + r - 2.\n\\]\n\nBy simplifying, we subtract \\( mr \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n2 = -2m + r - 2.\n\\]\nAdding 2 to both sides gives us:\n\\[\n4 = -2m + r.\n\\]\nRearranging this yields:\n\\[\nr = 2m + 4.\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting \\( r \\) back into the equation for \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = mr + 2 = m(2m + 4) + 2.\n\\]\nSimplifying this results in:\n\\[\nN = 2m^2 + 4m + 2.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( N \\) must be less than 100:\n\\[\n2m^2 + 4m + 2 < 100.\n\\]\nSubtracting 2 from both sides and dividing by 2, we get:\n\\[\nm^2 + 2m < 49.\n\\]\nThis leads to:\n\\[\nm^2 + 2m - 49 < 0.\n\\]\n\nTo find the critical points, we solve the quadratic equation \\( m^2 + 2m - 49 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nm = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 196}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{200}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 10\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nm = -1 \\pm 5\\sqrt{2}.\n\\]\nCalculating \\( 5\\sqrt{2} \\) gives approximately \\( 7.07 \\), so:\n\\[\nm \\approx -1 + 7.07 \\approx 6.07.\n\\]\nThus, \\( m \\) can take integer values up to 6.\n\nNow, we evaluate \\( m = 6 \\):\n\\[\nr = 2m + 4 = 2(6) + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16.\n\\]\nUsing these values to find \\( N \\):\n\\[\nN = 2m^2 + 4m + 2 = 2(6^2) + 4(6) + 2 = 72 + 24 + 2 = 98.\n\\]\n\nLastly, we confirm \\( N = 98 \\) meets both original conditions:\n1. For the arrangement with leftovers:\n   \\[\n   N = mr + 2 = 6(16) + 2 = 96 + 2 = 98 \\quad \\text{(correct)}.\n   \\]\n\n2. For the perfect fit arrangement:\n   \\[\n   N = (m + 1)(r - 2) = (7)(14) = 98 \\quad \\text{(correct)}.\n   \\]\n\nAfter checking smaller values for \\( m \\) (like 5 and 4) also yield valid \\( N \\) but less than 98, we conclude:\n\nThe largest number of band members possible is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{98}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, when two are left over.  Then we can write two equations from the given information: $$rx+2=m$$ $$(r-2)(x+1)=m$$ Setting these equal, we find: $$rx+2=(r-2)(x+1)=rx-2x+r-2$$ $$2=-2x+r-2$$ $$4=r-2x$$ We know that the band has less than 100 members.  Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98.  We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation.  If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big.  If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98.  Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\\cdot 7=98$ as it should.  This is the best we can do, so the largest number of members the band could have is $\\boxed{98}$."
