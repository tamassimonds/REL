  "problem": "Juan, Carlos and Manu take turns flipping a coin in their respective order. The first one to flip heads wins. What is the probability that Manu will win? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To determine the probability that Manu will win the coin flipping game, we can analyze the situation step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Game Structure**\n\nThe players flip the coin in this order: Juan, Carlos, and then Manu. The game continues until one of them flips heads (H). The first player to do so wins the game.\n\n**Step 2: Probabilities of Flipping Coins**\n\nEach player has the same chance of flipping heads (H), which is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), and tails (T), also \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n**Step 3: Manu's Winning Conditions**\n\n1. **Winning on His First Turn:**\n   For Manu to win immediately during his first turn, the following conditions must occur:\n   - Juan flips tails (probability = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\))\n   - Carlos flips tails (probability = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\))\n   - Manu flips heads (probability = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\))\n\n   Therefore, the probability of Manu winning on his first turn is:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Manu wins on first turn}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}\n   \\]\n\n2. **If Manu Does Not Win Immediately:**\n   If all players flip tails in one round, the game's conditions reset. The probability that all players flip tails is:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Juan T, Carlos T, Manu T}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}\n   \\]\n   In this case, the game returns to the original state with the same probabilities.\n\n**Step 4: Total Winning Probability Equation**\n\nLet \\( P \\) represent the total probability that Manu wins the game. He can win in two scenarios:\n1. He wins on his first turn with probability \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n2. All players flip tails, and we return to the same game state, contributing a probability of \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\times P \\).\n\nThus, we set up the equation:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} P\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Solve for \\( P \\)**\n\nRearranging the equation gives:\n\\[\nP - \\frac{1}{8} P = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{8} P = \\frac{1}{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nP = \\frac{1/8}{7/8} = \\frac{1}{7}\n\\]\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe probability that Manu will win the coin flipping game is \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\).",
  "ground_truth": "For Manu to win on his first turn, the sequence of flips would have to be TTH, which has probability $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3$.  For Manu to win on his second turn, the sequence of flips would have to be TTTTTH, which has probability $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6$.  Continuing, we find that the probability that Manu wins on his $n$th turn is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3n}$.  The probability that Manu wins is the sum of these probabilities, which is \\[\n\\frac{1}{2^3}+\\frac{1}{2^6}+\\frac{1}{2^9}+\\cdots=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2^3}}{1-\\frac{1}{2^3}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{7}},\n\\] where we have used the formula $a/(1-r)$ for the sum of an infinite geometric series whose first term is $a$ and whose common ratio is $r$."
