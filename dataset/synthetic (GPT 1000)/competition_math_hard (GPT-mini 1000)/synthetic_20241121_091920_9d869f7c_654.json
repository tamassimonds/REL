  "problem": "On the Cartesian plane in which each unit is one foot, a dog is tied to a post on the point $(4,3)$ by a $10$ foot rope. What is the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin?",
  "solution": "To determine the greatest distance a dog can be from the origin while tied to a post at \\((4,3)\\) with a \\(10\\) foot rope, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the distance from the origin to the post**: We use the distance formula:\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n   \\]\n   Where \\((x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)\\) (the origin) and \\((x_2, y_2) = (4, 3)\\) (the post location):\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the maximum distance the dog can reach**: The dog can move in a circle with a radius of \\(10\\) feet from the post. This means the furthest distance from the post that the dog can reach is \\(10\\) feet.\n\n3. **Calculate the maximum distance from the origin**: The furthest distance from the origin is the sum of the distance from the origin to the post and the length of the rope:\n   \\[\n   D = \\text{Distance from the origin to the post} + \\text{Rope length} = 5 + 10 = 15 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin while being tied to the post at \\((4,3)\\) with a \\(10\\) foot rope is \\(15\\) feet.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>15 feet</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The area the dog can go in is a circle of radius $10$ centered at the point $(4,3)$. The point farthest from $(0,0)$ in the circle would be the point on the circle's circumference which is on the same diameter as $(0,0)$ but on the other side of the center of the circle.\nThe distance from the origin to the center of the circle, by the distance formula, is $\\sqrt{(4-0)^2+(3-0)^2}=\\sqrt{16+9}=5$. As the radius of the circle is $10$, the distance from the origin to the point in the circle farthest from the origin is $\\boxed{15}$."
