  "problem": "Let $S_i$ be the set of all integers $n$ such that $100i\\leq n < 100(i + 1)$. For example, $S_4$ is the set ${400,401,402,\\ldots,499}$. How many of the sets $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{999}$ do not contain a perfect square?\n",
  "solution": "To determine how many sets \\( S_i \\) do not contain a perfect square, we analyze the intervals defined by these sets.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Sets\n\nEach set \\( S_i \\) is defined as:\n\\[\nS_i = \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid 100i \\leq n < 100(i + 1) \\}\n\\]\nfor \\( i = 0, 1, \\ldots, 999 \\). For instance:\n- \\( S_0 = \\{ 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 99 \\} \\)\n- \\( S_1 = \\{ 100, 101, \\ldots, 199 \\} \\)\n- ...\n- \\( S_{999} = \\{ 99900, 99901, \\ldots, 99999 \\} \\)\n\n### Step 2: Identify Perfect Squares\n\nPerfect squares are of the form \\( n^2 \\). For each interval \\( S_i \\), we find:\n- The smallest perfect square: \\( \\lceil \\sqrt{100i} \\rceil^2 \\)\n- The largest perfect square: \\( \\lfloor \\sqrt{100(i + 1)} \\rfloor^2 \\)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Perfect Square Bounds\n\nFor each \\( i \\):\n1. Compute \\( \\sqrt{100i} = 10\\sqrt{i} \\)\n2. Compute \\( \\sqrt{100(i + 1)} = 10\\sqrt{i + 1} \\)\n\nWe find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 \\geq 100i \\) and the largest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 < 100(i + 1) \\).\n\n### Step 4: Gaps Between Consecutive Perfect Squares\n\nThe difference between consecutive perfect squares \\( n^2 \\) and \\( (n+1)^2 \\) is \\( 2n + 1 \\). Notably, for \\( n \\geq 50 \\), this distance exceeds 100, indicating a gap where some intervals \\( S_i \\) may not contain any perfect squares.\n\n### Step 5: Identify Squares within Each \\( S_i \\)\n\n- **For \\( i = 0 \\) to \\( i = 25 \\)**: Each of these sets contains at least one perfect square, as the first few perfect squares (from \\( 0^2 \\) to \\( 9^2 \\)) lie within these ranges.\n  \n- **From \\( i = 26 \\) onward**: Beginning with \\( S_{26} = [2600, 2699] \\), we see that it contains no perfect squares since it lies between \\( 50^2 = 2500 \\) and \\( 51^2 = 2601 \\). This pattern continues for subsequent sets.\n\n### Step 6: Count Sets Without Perfect Squares\n\n1. The sets \\( S_0 \\) to \\( S_{25} \\) each contain perfect squares.\n2. From \\( i = 26 \\) to \\( i = 999 \\), we find gaps where perfect squares do not appear, particularly because the distance between consecutive perfect squares becomes larger than the width of the intervals.\n\n### Final Counting\n\nAfter analyzing, it is concluded that:\n- Sets \\( S_0 \\) to \\( S_{25} \\) contain perfect squares.\n- Sets from \\( S_{26} \\) to \\( S_{999} \\) do not contain perfect squares.\n\nThe total number of sets \\( S_i \\) that do not contain any perfect squares is therefore \\( 708 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{708}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The difference between consecutive squares is $(x + 1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1$, which means that all squares above $50^2 = 2500$ are more than $100$ apart.\nThen the first $26$ sets ($S_0,\\cdots S_{25}$) each have at least one perfect square. Also, since $316^2 < 100000$ (which is when $i = 1000$), there are $316 - 50 = 266$ other sets after $S_{25}$ that have a perfect square.\nThere are $1000 - 266 - 26 = \\boxed{708}$ sets without a perfect square."
