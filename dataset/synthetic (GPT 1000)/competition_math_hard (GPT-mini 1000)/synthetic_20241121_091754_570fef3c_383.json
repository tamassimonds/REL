  "problem": "A street has parallel curbs 40 feet apart. A crosswalk bounded by two parallel stripes crosses the street at an angle. The length of the curb between the stripes is 15 feet and each stripe is 50 feet long. Find the distance, in feet, between the stripes.",
  "solution": "To determine the distance between two parallel stripes on a crosswalk, we can utilize the properties of areas associated with a parallelogram formed by the crosswalk.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry**:\n   - The distance between the two curbs is 40 feet.\n   - The distance along the curb between the two stripes is 15 feet.\n   - Each stripe is 50 feet long.\n\n2. **Model the Crosswalk as a Parallelogram**:\n   - Consider the crosswalk as a parallelogram where:\n     - The base (distance along the curb between the stripes) = 15 feet.\n     - The height (distance between the curbs) = 40 feet.\n\n3. **Calculate the Area of the Parallelogram**:\n   - Using the area formula for a parallelogram: \n     \\[\n     A = \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n     \\]\n   - We can compute the area:\n     \\[\n     A = 15 \\text{ ft} \\times 40 \\text{ ft} = 600 \\text{ ft}^2\n     \\]\n\n4. **Alternate Calculation for Area**:\n   - Now, let's view the parallelogram differently:\n     - Use the length of each stripe as the base (50 feet).\n     - The height will be the distance between the two stripes, which we denote as \\( d \\).\n   - The area formula remains:\n     \\[\n     A = \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n     \\]\n   - Setting up the equation:\n     \\[\n     600 = 50 \\text{ ft} \\times d\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( d \\)**:\n   - Rearranging the equation to solve for \\( d \\):\n     \\[\n     d = \\frac{600 \\text{ ft}^2}{50 \\text{ ft}} = 12 \\text{ ft}\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the distance between the two stripes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12} \\text{ feet}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The crosswalk is in the shape of a parallelogram with base 15 feet and altitude 40 feet, so its area is $15 \\times 40 = 600\\; \\text{ft}^2$. But viewed another way, the parallelogram has base 50 feet and altitude equal to the distance between the stripes, so this distance must be $600/50=\\boxed{12}$ feet.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(10,0));\ndraw((0,7)--(10,7));\ndraw((0.5,0)--(0.5,7),Arrows);\nlabel(\"40\",(0.5,3.5),W);\nfill((3,0)--(6,0)--(8,7)--(5,7)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nlabel(\"15\",(4.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"15\",(6.5,7),N);\nlabel(\"50\",(4,3.5),W);\nlabel(\"50\",(7,3.5),E);\ndraw((3,0)--(6,0)--(8,7)--(5,7)--cycle);\n[/asy]"
