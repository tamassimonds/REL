  "solution": "To solve the problem involving the expression \\( m^2 - n^2 \\) for odd integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), we start by factoring the expression using the difference of squares:\n\n\\[\nm^2 - n^2 = (m - n)(m + n)\n\\]\n\nSince both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are odd, we can represent them as:\n- \\( m = 2k + 1 \\) for some integer \\( k \\)\n- \\( n = 2j + 1 \\) for some integer \\( j \\)\n\nSubstituting these forms into our factors, we have:\n- \\( m - n = (2k + 1) - (2j + 1) = 2(k - j) \\), which is even\n- \\( m + n = (2k + 1) + (2j + 1) = 2(k + j + 1) \\), which is also even\n\nBoth \\( m - n \\) and \\( m + n \\) are multiples of 2, allowing us to express \\( m^2 - n^2 \\) as:\n\n\\[\nm^2 - n^2 = (m - n)(m + n) = 2(k - j) \\cdot 2(k + j + 1) = 4(k - j)(k + j + 1)\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that \\( m^2 - n^2 \\) is divisible by 4.\n\nNext, to determine if \\( m^2 - n^2 \\) could be divisible by a higher power, we analyze the expression modulo 8 by evaluating a few specific pairs of odd integers:\n\n1. For \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = -1 \\):\n   \\[\n   m^2 - n^2 = 1^2 - (-1)^2 = 1 - 1 = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. For \\( m = 3 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   m^2 - n^2 = 3^2 - 1^2 = 9 - 1 = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. For \\( m = 5 \\) and \\( n = 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   m^2 - n^2 = 5^2 - 3^2 = 25 - 9 = 16\n   \\]\n\n4. For \\( m = 7 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   m^2 - n^2 = 7^2 - 1^2 = 49 - 1 = 48\n   \\]\n\n5. For \\( m = 9 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   m^2 - n^2 = 9^2 - 5^2 = 81 - 25 = 56\n   \\]\n\nThe results we obtain are: \\( 0, 8, 16, 48, 56 \\). Focusing on the non-zero results, we notice:\n\n- Those results are divisible by 8, and specific results like 16 also affirm divisibility by higher powers.\n\nCalculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these values yields that \\( 8 \\) is a consistent divisor across various computations. While we verify that \\( 16 \\) also appears, \\( 8 \\) remains the higher limit across all samples.\n\nThus, we conclude that the largest integer that divides all potential outcomes of the form \\( m^2 - n^2 \\) when \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are odd is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<ANSWER> 8 solution </ANSWER>}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "First, factor the difference of squares.\\[(m+n)(m-n)\\]Since $m$ and $n$ are odd numbers, let $m=2a+1$ and $n=2b+1$, where $a$ and $b$ can be any integer.\\[(2a+2b+2)(2a-2b)\\]Factor the resulting expression.\\[4(a+b+1)(a-b)\\]If $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $a-b$ is even. If $a$ and $b$ are both odd, then $a-b$ is even as well. If $a$ is odd and $b$ is even (or vise versa), then $a+b+1$ is even. Therefore, in all cases, $8$ can be divided into all numbers with the form $m^2-n^2$.\nThis can be confirmed by setting $m=3$ and $n=1$, making $m^2-n^2=9-1=8$. Since $8$ is not a multiple of $3$ and is less than $16$, we can confirm that the answer is $\\boxed{8}$."
