  "problem": "At the beginning of every period of British Literature, Mrs. Crabapple picks a random student to receive a crabapple as a gift, but really, as you might imagine, they are quite bitter and nasty. Given that there are 11 students in her class and her class meets four times a week, how many different sequences of crabapple recipients are possible in a week?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of different sequences of crabapple recipients in a week, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Context\n- There are **11 students** in the class.\n- The class meets **4 times a week**.\n\n### Step 2: Choices for Each Meeting\nAt each of the 4 class meetings, Mrs. Crabapple has **11 choices** (one for each student).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Sequences\nSince the choice for each meeting is independent, we calculate the total number of sequences using multiplication:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Sequences} = 11 \\times 11 \\times 11 \\times 11 = 11^4\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compute \\(11^4\\)\nFirst, calculate \\(11^2\\):\n\n\\[\n11^2 = 121\n\\]\n\nThen, to find \\(11^4\\), we square \\(121\\):\n\n\\[\n11^4 = 121 \\times 121\n\\]\n\nWe can calculate this using the distributive property:\n\n\\[\n121 \\times 121 = (120 + 1) \\times (120 + 1) = 120^2 + 2 \\times 120 \\times 1 + 1^2\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate each part:\n\n1. \\(120^2 = 14400\\)\n2. \\(2 \\times 120 \\times 1 = 240\\)\n3. \\(1^2 = 1\\)\n\nAdding these results together:\n\n\\[\n14400 + 240 + 1 = 14641\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: State the Final Answer\nTherefore, the total number of different sequences of crabapple recipients for the week is:\n\n**14641**",
  "ground_truth": "Since there is no mention that a student cannot be picked twice, there are 11 possible victims every time the class meets. Therefore, our answer is $11 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 11 = 11^4 = \\boxed{14,\\!641}.$"
