  "problem": "Krzysztof solved the quadratic equation $11x^2-44x-99=0$ by completing the square. In the process, he came up with the equivalent equation $$(x+r)^2 = s,$$where $r$ and $s$ are constants.\n\nWhat is $r+s$?",
  "solution": "To solve the quadratic equation \\( 11x^2 - 44x - 99 = 0 \\) using the method of completing the square, we start by simplifying the equation. We divide the entire equation by 11:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x - 9 = 0.\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate the quadratic expression on the left side by moving the constant term to the right side:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x = 9.\n\\]\n\nTo complete the square, we take the coefficient of \\( x \\) (which is -4), halve it to get -2, and then square it to obtain 4. We add and subtract this value within the equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 - 4 = 9.\n\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 - 4 = 9.\n\\]\n\nNow, we move the -4 to the right side:\n\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 = 9 + 4,\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(x - 2)^2 = 13.\n\\]\n\nFrom this equation, we can identify \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) in the standard form \\( (x + r)^2 = s \\):\n\n\\[\nr = -2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s = 13.\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate \\( r + s \\):\n\n\\[\nr + s = -2 + 13 = 11.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<11> solution</11>",
  "ground_truth": "Dividing both sides of the equation $11x^2-44x-99$ by $11$, we have $$x^2-4x-9 = 0.$$The square which agrees with $x^2-4x-9$ except for the constant term is $(x-2)^2$, which is equal to $x^2-4x+4$ and thus to $(x^2-4x-9)+13$.\n\nTherefore, by adding $13$ to each side, Krzysztof rewrote the equation $x^2-4x-9 = 0$ as $$(x-2)^2 = 13$$We have $r=-2$, $s=13$, and thus $r+s=\\boxed{11}$."
