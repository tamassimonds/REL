  "problem": "What is the domain of the function $$w(x) = \\sqrt{x-2} + \\sqrt[3]{x-3}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.",
  "solution": "To find the domain of the function \n\n\\[\nw(x) = \\sqrt{x-2} + \\sqrt[3]{x-3},\n\\]\n\nwe need to examine the conditions imposed by each component of the function: the square root and the cube root.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the square root component**\n\nThe term \\(\\sqrt{x-2}\\) requires that the expression inside the square root is non-negative. This leads to the inequality:\n\n\\[\nx - 2 \\geq 0.\n\\]\n\nSolving this gives:\n\n\\[\nx \\geq 2.\n\\]\n\nThus, for \\(\\sqrt{x-2}\\) to return a real value, \\(x\\) must be at least 2.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the cube root component**\n\nThe term \\(\\sqrt[3]{x-3}\\) does not have restrictions on its domain since cube roots are defined for all real numbers. Consequently, this term does not impose any additional limitations on \\(x\\).\n\n**Step 3: Combine the restrictions**\n\nSince the cube root presents no restrictions, the overall domain of \\(w(x)\\) is determined solely by the condition \\(x \\geq 2\\) from the square root.\n\n**Step 4: Express the domain in interval notation**\n\nIn interval notation, the domain of \\(w(x)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n[2, \\infty).\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the domain of the function is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{[2, \\infty)}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Note that $\\sqrt[3]{x-3}$ is defined for all $x$. The only restriction is due to the $\\sqrt{x-2}$ term, which is defined only if $x-2$ is nonnegative. Thus, the domain of $w(x)$ is $\\boxed{[2,\\infty)}$."
