  "problem": "Kaleb defined a $\\emph{clever integer}$ as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9. What fraction of all clever integers is divisible by 27? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To determine the fraction of clever integers that are divisible by 27, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Range of Clever Integers\nClever integers must meet the following criteria:\n- They are even.\n- They are greater than 20 and less than 120.\n- The sum of their digits equals 9.\n\nThus, we focus on even integers ranging from 22 to 118 (inclusive).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Clever Integers\nWe identify all even integers in this range with a digit sum of 9. The even integers from 22 to 118 form an arithmetic sequence with:\n- First term (\\(a\\)) = 22\n- Last term (\\(l\\)) = 118\n- Common difference (\\(d\\)) = 2\n\nThe number of terms (\\(n\\)) is calculated as follows:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{l - a}{d} + 1 = \\frac{118 - 22}{2} + 1 = 49\n\\]\nThus, there are 49 even integers in this range.\n\nNext, we check the digit sums of each even integer:\n- Clever integers where the sum of the digits equals 9 are:\n  - 36: \\(3 + 6 = 9\\)\n  - 54: \\(5 + 4 = 9\\)\n  - 72: \\(7 + 2 = 9\\)\n  - 90: \\(9 + 0 = 9\\)\n  - 108: \\(1 + 0 + 8 = 9\\)\n\nThis results in a total of **5 clever integers**: 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108.\n\n### Step 3: Count Clever Integers Divisible by 27\nNext, we check how many of these clever integers are divisible by 27:\n- \\(36 \\div 27\\) = not divisible\n- \\(54 \\div 27 = 2\\) (divisible)\n- \\(72 \\div 27\\) = not divisible\n- \\(90 \\div 27\\) = not divisible\n- \\(108 \\div 27 = 4\\) (divisible)\n\nOnly **2** clever integers (54 and 108) are divisible by 27.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Fraction\nTo find the fraction of clever integers that are divisible by 27:\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\text{Number of clever integers divisible by 27}}{\\text{Total number of clever integers}} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe fraction of clever integers that are divisible by 27 is:\n\n<ANSWER> \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$."
