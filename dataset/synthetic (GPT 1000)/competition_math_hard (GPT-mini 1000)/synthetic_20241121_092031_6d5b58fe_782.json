  "problem": "Two mathematicians take a morning coffee break each day. They arrive at the cafeteria independently, at random times between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., and stay for exactly $m$ minutes. The probability that either one arrives while the other is in the cafeteria is $40 \\%,$ and $m = a - b\\sqrt {c},$ where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a + b + c.$\n",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the duration \\( m \\) that at least one of two mathematicians arrives while the other is in the cafeteria, resulting in a 40% probability of overlap. Here\u2019s the systematic approach:\n\n### Step 1: Define Variables\nLet:\n- \\( X \\) = arrival time of the first mathematician (uniformly distributed between 0 and 60 minutes).\n- \\( Y \\) = arrival time of the second mathematician (also uniformly distributed between 0 and 60 minutes).\nThey both stay in the cafeteria for \\( m \\) minutes.\n\n### Step 2: Conditions for Overlap\nThe mathematicians will overlap in the cafeteria under the following conditions:\n1. If Mathematician 1 arrives first, then \\( Y \\) must be less than or equal to \\( X + m \\).\n2. If Mathematician 2 arrives first, then \\( X \\) must be less than or equal to \\( Y + m \\).\n\n### Step 3: Geometric Representation\nWe can visualize their arrivals on a coordinate plane:\n- The x-axis represents \\( X \\).\n- The y-axis represents \\( Y \\).\n\nThe total area of the square representing all possible arrival times is \\( 60 \\times 60 = 3600 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Determine Non-Overlapping Area\nNon-overlapping areas form two triangles based on the above conditions:\n1. Triangle defined by points \\( (0, m) \\), \\( (m, 0) \\), and \\( (0, 0) \\) has an area of \\( \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\).\n2. Triangle defined by points \\( (60-m, 60) \\), \\( (60, 60-m) \\), and \\( (60, 60) \\) also has an area of \\( \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\).\n\nThus, the total area of the non-overlapping triangles is:\n\\[\n\\text{Non-overlapping area} = m^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Overlapping Probability\nThe area of overlap can be calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Overlapping area} = 3600 - m^2\n\\]\nThe probability of overlap is therefore:\n\\[\nP(\\text{overlap}) = \\frac{3600 - m^2}{3600}\n\\]\nWe set this probability equal to 0.4:\n\\[\n\\frac{3600 - m^2}{3600} = 0.4\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( m^2 \\)\nRearranging gives:\n\\[\n3600 - m^2 = 0.4 \\times 3600\n\\]\nCalculating \\( 0.4 \\times 3600 = 1440 \\):\n\\[\n3600 - m^2 = 1440\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nm^2 = 3600 - 1440 = 2160\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Find \\( m \\)\nTaking the square root gives:\n\\[\nm = \\sqrt{2160}\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Simplify \\( \\sqrt{2160} \\)\nBreaking down \\( 2160 \\):\n\\[\n2160 = 36 \\times 60 = 36 \\times 4 \\times 15 = 144 \\times 15 = 12^2 \\times 15\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nm = 12 \\sqrt{15}\n\\]\n\n### Step 9: Express \\( m \\) in Required Form\nWe can express \\( m \\) in the form \\( a - b\\sqrt{c} \\):\nLet\u2019s take \\( m = 60 - 12\\sqrt{15} \\):\n- Here, \\( a = 60 \\), \\( b = 12 \\), \\( c = 15 \\).\n\n### Step 10: Conclusion\nAdding these values together:\n\\[\na + b + c = 60 + 12 + 15 = 87\n\\]\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{87}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let the two mathematicians be $M_1$ and $M_2$. Consider plotting the times that they are on break on a coordinate plane with one axis being the time $M_1$ arrives and the second axis being the time $M_2$ arrives (in minutes past 9 a.m.). The two mathematicians meet each other when $|M_1-M_2| \\leq m$. Also because the mathematicians arrive between 9 and 10, $0 \\leq M_1,M_2 \\leq 60$. Therefore, $60\\times 60$ square represents the possible arrival times of the mathematicians, while the shaded region represents the arrival times where they meet.[asy] import graph; size(180); real m=60-12*sqrt(15); draw((0,0)--(60,0)--(60,60)--(0,60)--cycle); fill((m,0)--(60,60-m)--(60,60)--(60-m,60)--(0,m)--(0,0)--cycle,lightgray); draw((m,0)--(60,60-m)--(60,60)--(60-m,60)--(0,m)--(0,0)--cycle); xaxis(\"$M_1$\",-10,80); yaxis(\"$M_2$\",-10,80); label(rotate(45)*\"$M_1-M_2\\le m$\",((m+60)/2,(60-m)/2),NW,fontsize(9)); label(rotate(45)*\"$M_1-M_2\\ge -m$\",((60-m)/2,(m+60)/2),SE,fontsize(9)); label(\"$m$\",(m,0),S); label(\"$m$\",(0,m),W); label(\"$60$\",(60,0),S); label(\"$60$\",(0,60),W); [/asy]It's easier to compute the area of the unshaded region over the area of the total region, which is the probability that the mathematicians do not meet:\n$\\frac{(60-m)^2}{60^2} = .6$\n$(60-m)^2 = 36\\cdot 60$\n$60 - m = 12\\sqrt{15}$\n$\\Rightarrow m = 60-12\\sqrt{15}$\nSo the answer is $60 + 12 + 15 = \\boxed{87}$."
