  "problem": "The area of a rectangle is 432 square centimeters. What would the new area be if the length of the rectangle was decreased by $10\\%$ and the width of the rectangle was increased by $10\\%$? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
  "solution": "To find the new area of the rectangle after modifying its dimensions, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Original Dimensions**: Let the original length of the rectangle be \\( L \\) and the original width be \\( W \\). We know from the problem statement that:\n   \\[\n   L \\times W = 432\n   \\]\n\n2. **Adjust Dimensions**: We will decrease the length \\( L \\) by \\( 10\\% \\) and increase the width \\( W \\) by \\( 10\\% \\):\n   - New Length:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New Length} = L - 0.1L = 0.9L\n   \\]\n   - New Width:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New Width} = W + 0.1W = 1.1W\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate New Area**: The new area \\( A_{\\text{new}} \\) of the rectangle with the adjusted dimensions is given by:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{new}} = \\text{New Length} \\times \\text{New Width} = (0.9L) \\times (1.1W)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the New Area**:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{new}} = 0.9L \\times 1.1W = 0.99(L \\times W)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substitute Original Area**: We can substitute the original area value from earlier:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{new}} = 0.99 \\times 432\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate Final Value**:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{new}} = 0.99 \\times 432 = 427.68\n   \\]\n\n7. **Round to Nearest Whole Number**: Finally, rounding \\( 427.68 \\) to the nearest whole number gives us:\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{new}} \\approx 428\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the new area of the rectangle after the changes is **428** square centimeters. \n\n<ANSWER>428</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "If the length of the rectangle is decreased by $10\\%$, it will be $90\\%$ of what it was. If the width is increased by $10\\%$, it will be $110\\%$ of what it was. The area will be $0.9 \\times 1.1 = 0.99 = 99\\%$ of what it was. Thus, $99\\%$ of 432 is $0.99 \\times 432 = 427.68$ or about $\\boxed{428\\text{ square centimeters}}$."
