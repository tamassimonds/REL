  "problem": "A woman labels the squares of a very large chessboard $1$ through $64$. On each square $k$, the woman puts $2^k$ grains of rice. How many more grains of rice are placed on the $10^{th}$ square than on the first $8$ squares combined?",
  "solution": "To determine how many more grains of rice are on the \\(10^{th}\\) square compared to the total number of grains on the first \\(8\\) squares, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the grains on the \\(10^{th}\\) square**:\n   The number of grains on the \\(k^{th}\\) square is given by \\(2^k\\). Therefore, for the \\(10^{th}\\) square:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Grains on the } 10^{th} \\text{ square} = 2^{10} = 1024\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total grains on the first \\(8\\) squares**:\n   We need to sum the grains on squares \\(1\\) to \\(8\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total grains on the first 8 squares} = 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8\n   \\]\n   This is a geometric series where the first term \\(a = 2\\), the common ratio \\(r = 2\\), and the number of terms \\(n = 8\\). The sum of the series is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   S_n = a \\frac{(r^n - 1)}{(r - 1)}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   S_8 = 2 \\frac{(2^8 - 1)}{(2 - 1)} = 2 \\cdot (256 - 1) = 2 \\cdot 255 = 510\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the difference**:\n   Next, we find the difference between the grains on the \\(10^{th}\\) square and the total on the first \\(8\\) squares:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = \\text{Grains on the } 10^{th} \\text{ square} - \\text{Total grains on the first 8 squares} = 1024 - 510\n   \\]\n   Performing the calculation gives:\n   \\[\n   1024 - 510 = 514\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{The number of grains of rice on the } 10^{th} \\text{ square is } 514 \\text{ more than the total on the first 8 squares.}\n\\]\n\nSo, the formatted answer is:\n<ANSWER>514 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The $10^{th}$ square receives $2^{10}=1024$ grains. The first $8$ squares receive $2+2^2+\\dots+2^8=2\\left(\\frac{2^8-1}{2-1}\\right)=2(256-1)=2(255)=510$. Thus the $10^{th}$ square receives $1024-510=\\boxed{514}$ more grains than the first $8$ combined."
