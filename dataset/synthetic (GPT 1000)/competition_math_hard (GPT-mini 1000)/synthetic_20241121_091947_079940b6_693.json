  "problem": "Two numbers $90$ and $m$ share exactly three positive divisors. What is the greatest of these three common divisors?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of finding a number \\( m \\) such that \\( 90 \\) and \\( m \\) share exactly three positive divisors, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factor the Number \\( 90 \\)\n\nWe start by factorizing \\( 90 \\):\n\n\\[\n90 = 2^1 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Divisors of \\( 90 \\)\n\nUsing the formula for counting divisors based on prime factorization, where the number of divisors is computed as:\n\n\\[\n(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\ldots (e_n + 1)\n\\]\n\nFor our factorization of \\( 90 \\):\n\n- The exponent of \\( 2 \\) is \\( 1 \\), contributing \\( 2 \\) to the count.\n- The exponent of \\( 3 \\) is \\( 2 \\), contributing \\( 3 \\) to the count.\n- The exponent of \\( 5 \\) is \\( 1 \\), contributing \\( 2 \\) to the count.\n\nThus, the total number of divisors of \\( 90 \\):\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 12\n\\]\n\nThe positive divisors of \\( 90 \\) are:\n\n\\[\n1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find a Suitable \\( m \\)\n\nWe need to find a number \\( m \\) such that \\( 90 \\) and \\( m \\) share exactly three positive divisors. The GCD (greatest common divisor) must thus be of a specific form. The number of common divisors, based on the GCD \\( d = \\text{gcd}(90, m) \\), can be calculated using the same divisor counting formula.\n\nFor \\( d \\) to have exactly 3 divisors, it must take the form \\( p^2 \\) for some prime \\( p \\). This is because \\( p^2 \\) has \\( 2 + 1 = 3 \\) divisors.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Possible Values for \\( d \\) \n\nConsidering the prime factors of \\( 90 \\):\n\n- \\( p = 2 \\) gives \\( d = 2^2 = 4 \\) (which divides \\( 90 \\)).\n- \\( p = 3 \\) gives \\( d = 3^2 = 9 \\) (which divides \\( 90 \\)).\n- \\( p = 5 \\) gives \\( d = 5^2 = 25 \\) (which does not divide \\( 90 \\)).\n\nTherefore, the valid options for \\( d \\) are \\( 4 \\) and \\( 9 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Common Divisors\n\n1. If \\( d = 4 \\): The common divisors between \\( 90 \\) and \\( m \\) are \\( 1, 2, 4 \\). We could take \\( m = 4 \\).\n  \n2. If \\( d = 9 \\): The common divisors are \\( 1, 3, 9 \\). We could take \\( m = 9 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNext, we compare the highest common divisors:\n\n- For \\( d = 4 \\): The largest common divisor is \\( 4 \\).\n- For \\( d = 9 \\): The largest common divisor is \\( 9 \\).\n\nBetween these, the greatest common divisor is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]\n\nThus, the solution concludes that \\( 9 \\) is the greatest common divisor between \\( 90 \\) and an appropriate \\( m \\).",
  "ground_truth": "Recall that the common divisors of two integers are precisely the divisors of the greatest common divisor. So, for two numbers to have exactly three positive divisors in common, those divisors must be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$ such that $p$ is prime. We now look at the prime factorization of $90$: $90=2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. Since $3^2$ is the only perfect square divisor of $90$, the divisors that $90$ and $m$ share must be $1$, $3$, and $9$. The largest of these three numbers is $\\boxed{9}$."
