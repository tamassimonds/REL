  "problem": "In a certain cross country meet between 2 teams of 5 runners each, a runner who finishes in the $n$th position contributes $n$ to his teams score. The team with the lower score wins. If there are no ties among the runners, how many different winning scores are possible?\n(A) 10 (B) 13 (C) 27 (D) 120 (E) 126\n",
  "solution": "To determine how many different winning scores are possible in a cross-country meet between two teams of five runners each, we can analyze the scoring system and the constraints involved.\n\n### Total Runners and Scoring\nThere are 10 runners in total (5 from each team), and they finish in positions ranked from 1 to 10. A team's score is the sum of the finishing positions of its runners. \n\n### Total Score Calculation\nThe total score for all runners combined is the sum of the first 10 natural numbers:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 10 = \\frac{10 \\times (10 + 1)}{2} = 55.\n\\]\n\n### Team Scores\nLet \\(S_A\\) be the score for team A and \\(S_B\\) for team B. Since \\(S_A + S_B = 55\\), the winning team is the one with the lower score. Therefore, the winning score (denoted as \\(S_{\\text{win}}\\)) can be represented as:\n\\[\nS_{\\text{win}} = \\min(S_A, S_B).\n\\]\n\n### Constraints for Winning Scores\nFor team A to win, their score must be less than that of team B:\n\\[\nS_A < S_B \\implies S_A < 55 - S_A \\implies 2S_A < 55 \\implies S_A < 27.5.\n\\]\nThus, team A's maximum possible score is capped at 27 (the highest integer less than 27.5).\n\n### Possible Scores for Team A\nThe scores that team A can potentially achieve range from a minimum of 15 to a maximum of 27. The minimum score of 15 occurs when team A finishes in the first five positions (1st to 5th), calculated as:\n\\[\nS_A = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.\n\\]\nThe maximum score of 27 can be attained when adjusting the finishing positions while ensuring team A's score stays below 27.\n\n### Evaluating Achievable Scores\nWe evaluate all integer scores from 15 to 27 to determine their feasibility:\n- **15** (1+2+3+4+5)\n- **16** (1+2+3+4+6)\n- **17** (1+2+3+4+7)\n- **18** (1+2+3+5+7)\n- ...\n- Continue this way until reaching 27.\n\nAfter checking every integer in this range, it becomes clear that it is indeed possible for team A to achieve every score from 15 to 27 through various combinations of finishing positions.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the different possible winning scores are all integers from 15 to 27. The total number of distinct winning scores is:\n\\[\n27 - 15 + 1 = 13.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>13</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The scores of all ten runners must sum to $55$. So a winning score is anything between $1+2+3+4+5=15$ and $\\lfloor\\tfrac{55}{2}\\rfloor=27$ inclusive. It is easy to check that this range is covered by considering $1+2+3+4+x$, $1+2+3+x+10$ and $1+2+x+9+10$, so the answer is $\\boxed{13}$."
