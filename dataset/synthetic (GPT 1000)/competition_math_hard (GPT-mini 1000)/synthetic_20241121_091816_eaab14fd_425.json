  "problem": "A swimming pool can be filled by any of three hoses A, B or C. Hoses A and B together take 4 hours to fill the pool. Hoses A and C together take 5 hours to fill the pool. Hoses B and C together take 6 hours to fill the pool. How many hours does it take hoses A, B and C working together to fill the pool? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
  "solution": "To determine the time it takes for hoses A, B, and C to fill the pool together, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Establish Rates for Each Hose:**\n   Let the filling rates of hoses A, B, and C be \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) pools per hour, respectively.\n\n2. **Formulate Rate Equations:**\n   Using the provided information:\n   - Hoses A and B together fill the pool in 4 hours:\n     \\[\n     a + b = \\frac{1}{4} \\quad \\text{(pools/hour)}\n     \\]\n   - Hoses A and C together fill it in 5 hours:\n     \\[\n     a + c = \\frac{1}{5} \\quad \\text{(pools/hour)}\n     \\]\n   - Hoses B and C together fill it in 6 hours:\n     \\[\n     b + c = \\frac{1}{6} \\quad \\text{(pools/hour)}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Set Up the System of Equations:**\n   We have three equations:\n   \\[\n   1) \\quad a + b = \\frac{1}{4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2) \\quad a + c = \\frac{1}{5}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3) \\quad b + c = \\frac{1}{6}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the System:**\n   - From equations (1) and (2), subtract to find \\( b - c \\):\n     \\[\n     b - c = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{20} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = c + \\frac{1}{20}\n     \\]\n\n   - Substitute \\( b \\) into equation (1):\n     \\[\n     a + (c + \\frac{1}{20}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a + c = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{4}{20} = \\frac{1}{5} \\quad \\text{(consistent with equation 2)}\n     \\]\n\n   - Substitute \\( b \\) into equation (3):\n     \\[\n     (c + \\frac{1}{20}) + c = \\frac{1}{6} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2c + \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{1}{6}\n     \\]\n     - Finding a common denominator (60) gives:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{10}{60}, \\quad \\text{and } \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{3}{60}\n     \\]\n     - Rearranging gives:\n     \\[\n     2c = \\frac{10 - 3}{60} = \\frac{7}{60} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c = \\frac{7}{120}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Substitute to Find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):**\n   - Finding \\( b \\):\n     \\[\n     b = \\frac{7}{120} + \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{7}{120} + \\frac{6}{120} = \\frac{13}{120}\n     \\]\n   - Finding \\( a \\):\n     \\[\n     a + \\frac{7}{120} = \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{24}{120} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = \\frac{24}{120} - \\frac{7}{120} = \\frac{17}{120}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate Total Rate:**\n   The combined rate of hoses A, B, and C is:\n   \\[\n   a + b + c = \\frac{17}{120} + \\frac{13}{120} + \\frac{7}{120} = \\frac{37}{120}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Determine Time to Fill the Pool:**\n   The time \\( T \\) taken when all hoses work together is the reciprocal of their combined rate:\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{1}{\\frac{37}{120}} = \\frac{120}{37} \\approx 3.243243\n   \\]\n\n8. **Final Answer:**\n   Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we find:\n   \\[\n   T \\approx 3.24 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the time for hoses A, B, and C to fill the pool together is approximately **3.24 hours**.",
  "ground_truth": "Let the rate that hose $A$ fills the pool be equal to $A$, and similarly for hoses $B$ and $C$.  Then, let $P$ be equal to the volume of the pool.  From the given information, we can write the equation $P=4(A+B)$, which just says the pool volume is equal to the rate it is being filled, multiplied by the time taken to fill it.  We can rewrite this as $\\frac{P}{4}=A+B$.  Doing this with the rest of the given information, we can write three equations: $$\\frac{P}{4}=A+B$$ $$\\frac{P}{5}=A+C$$ $$\\frac{P}{6}=B+C$$ Adding these three equations, we can simplify as shown: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{P}{4}+\\frac{P}{5}+\\frac{P}{6}&=(A+B)+(A+C)+(B+C)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{15P}{60}+\\frac{12P}{60}+\\frac{10P}{60}&=2(A+B+C)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 37P&=120(A+B+C)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad P&=\\frac{120}{37}(A+B+C)\n\\end{align*} Looking carefully at the final expression here, we can see that $A+B+C$ is the rate that the pool would be filled with all three hoses working together.  So, $\\frac{120}{37}\\approx \\boxed{3.24}$ is equal to the number of hours it would take all three hoses to fill the pool."
