  "problem": "Alexio has 100 cards numbered 1-100, inclusive, and places them in a box. Alexio then chooses a card from the box at random. What is the probability that the number on the card he chooses is a multiple of 2, 3 or 5? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
  "solution": "To determine the probability that Alexio chooses a card with a number that is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5, we can apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let\u2019s outline the solution step-by-step for clarity:\n\n1. **Total Outcomes**: There are 100 cards total, so the total number of possible outcomes when Alexio selects a card is:\n   \\[\n   N = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Define Sets**:\n   - Let \\(A\\) be the set of multiples of 2.\n   - Let \\(B\\) be the set of multiples of 3.\n   - Let \\(C\\) be the set of multiples of 5.\n\n3. **Count Multiples in Each Set**:\n   - **Multiples of 2**: From 1 to 100, these are \\(2, 4, 6, \\ldots, 100\\). The count is:\n     \\[\n     |A| = \\frac{100}{2} = 50\n     \\]\n   - **Multiples of 3**: These are \\(3, 6, 9, \\ldots, 99\\). The count is:\n     \\[\n     |B| = \\frac{99}{3} = 33\n     \\]\n   - **Multiples of 5**: These are \\(5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 100\\). The count is:\n     \\[\n     |C| = \\frac{100}{5} = 20\n     \\]\n\n4. **Count Intersections of Sets**:\n   - **Multiples of 6** (both 2 and 3): These are \\(6, 12, 18, \\ldots, 96\\).\n     \\[\n     |A \\cap B| = \\frac{96}{6} = 16\n     \\]\n   - **Multiples of 10** (both 2 and 5): These are \\(10, 20, 30, \\ldots, 100\\).\n     \\[\n     |A \\cap C| = \\frac{100}{10} = 10\n     \\]\n   - **Multiples of 15** (both 3 and 5): These are \\(15, 30, 45, \\ldots, 90\\).\n     \\[\n     |B \\cap C| = \\frac{90}{15} = 6\n     \\]\n   - **Multiples of 30** (common to 2, 3, and 5): These are \\(30, 60, 90\\).\n     \\[\n     |A \\cap B \\cap C| = \\frac{90}{30} = 3\n     \\]\n\n5. **Apply Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: \n   The total number of cards that are multiples of 2, 3, or 5 is given by:\n   \\[\n   |A \\cup B \\cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \\cap B| - |A \\cap C| - |B \\cap C| + |A \\cap B \\cap C|\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we calculated:\n   \\[\n   |A \\cup B \\cup C| = 50 + 33 + 20 - 16 - 10 - 6 + 3 = 74\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the Probability**:\n   The probability that the number on the chosen card is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5 is given by the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{|A \\cup B \\cup C|}{N} = \\frac{74}{100} = \\frac{37}{50}\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the probability that the number on the card Alexio chooses is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5 is:\n\\[\n\\text{The probability is } \\frac{37}{50}.\n\\]  \nThus,\n<ANSWER>37/50 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "There are 50 numbers between 1-100 inclusive which are divisible by 2 --- all the even numbers. To avoid overcounting, we must find all the odd multiples of 3. Beginning with 3, the sequence of all such numbers is $3, 9, 15\\cdots99$, which gives $\\dfrac{99-3}{6}+1=17$ such numbers.\n\nFinally, we must find all odd multiples of 5 which are not divisible by 3. These are 5, 25, 35, 55, 65, 85, and 95. This gives a final count of $50+17+7=74$ numbers between 1-100 inclusive which are multiples of 2, 3, or 5.\n\nThe probability that Alexio selects one of these is therefore $\\boxed{\\dfrac{37}{50}}$."
