  "problem": "What is the greatest integer less than 100 for which the greatest common divisor of that integer and 12 is 4?",
  "solution": "To find the greatest integer less than 100 for which the greatest common divisor (gcd) with 12 equals 4, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding GCD:** The gcd of two numbers, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), is the largest integer that divides both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) without leaving a remainder. We want to ensure that \\( \\text{gcd}(x, 12) = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Analyzing 12:** The prime factorization of 12 is \\(12 = 2^2 \\times 3\\). For the gcd to be 4, our integer \\(x\\) must include the prime factors of 4, specifically \\(2^2\\), but must not include 3 to prevent the gcd from exceeding 4.\n\n3. **Formulating \\(x\\):** Therefore, \\(x\\) can be expressed in the form:\n   \\[\n   x = 4k\n   \\]\n   where \\(k\\) is an integer that does not introduce a factor of 3 into \\(x\\).\n\n4. **Constraints on \\(k\\):** Since we want \\(x < 100\\):\n   \\[\n   4k < 100 \\implies k < 25\n   \\]\n   This means \\(k\\) can take values from 0 to 24.\n\n5. **Identifying Valid \\(x\\) Values:** We will calculate \\(x\\) for each \\(k\\) from 0 to 24 and check which values of \\(x\\) are not divisible by 3:\n   - \\(k = 0: x = 0\\)\n   - \\(k = 1: x = 4\\)\n   - \\(k = 2: x = 8\\)\n   - \\(k = 3: x = 12\\) (not valid since gcd would be 12)\n   - \\(k = 4: x = 16\\)\n   - \\(k = 5: x = 20\\)\n   - \\(k = 6: x = 24\\) (not valid since gcd would be 12)\n   - \\(k = 7: x = 28\\)\n   - \\(k = 8: x = 32\\)\n   - \\(k = 9: x = 36\\) (not valid since gcd would be 12)\n   - \\(k = 10: x = 40\\)\n   - \\(k = 11: x = 44\\)\n   - \\(k = 12: x = 48\\) (not valid since gcd would be 12)\n   - \\(k = 13: x = 52\\)\n   - \\(k = 14: x = 56\\)\n   - \\(k = 15: x = 60\\) (not valid since gcd would be 12)\n   - \\(k = 16: x = 64\\)\n   - \\(k = 17: x = 68\\)\n   - \\(k = 18: x = 72\\) (not valid since gcd would be 12)\n   - \\(k = 19: x = 76\\)\n   - \\(k = 20: x = 80\\)\n   - \\(k = 21: x = 84\\) (not valid since gcd would be 12)\n   - \\(k = 22: x = 88\\)\n   - \\(k = 23: x = 92\\)\n   - \\(k = 24: x = 96\\) (not valid since gcd would be 12)\n\n6. **Valid Candidates for \\(x\\):** The valid integers are:\n   - 0, 4, 8, 16, 20, 28, 32, 40, 44, 52, 56, 64, 68, 76, 80, 88, 92.\n\n7. **Finding the Maximum:** Among these valid integers, the greatest one less than 100 is:\n   - **92**.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>92</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The prime factors of 12 are 2, 2, and 3. If the greatest common factor with 12 is 4, that means the other number is a multiple of 4 but not 6, 12. Since the other number must an even number (multiple of 2), we start with 98 and look at decreasing even numbers. 98 is not a multiple of 4. 96 is a multiple of 6 and 12. 94 is not a multiple of 4. So, the greatest integer less than 100 that satisfies the conditions is $\\boxed{92}$."
