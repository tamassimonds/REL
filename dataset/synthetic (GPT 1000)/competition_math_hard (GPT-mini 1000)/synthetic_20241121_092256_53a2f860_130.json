  "problem": "Two circles, one of radius 5 inches, the other of radius 2 inches, are tangent at point P. Two bugs start crawling at the same time from point P, one crawling along the larger circle at $3\\pi$ inches per minute, the other crawling along the smaller circle at $2.5\\pi$ inches per minute. How many minutes is it before their next meeting at point P?",
  "solution": "To determine when two bugs meet again at point P after starting from the same point, we will calculate the time it takes for each bug to complete one full lap around their respective circles, and then find the least common multiple (LCM) of these times.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Circumference of Each Circle\n\n1. **Larger Circle** (radius = 5 inches):\n   \\[\n   C_1 = 2 \\pi r_1 = 2 \\pi \\times 5 = 10\\pi \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Smaller Circle** (radius = 2 inches):\n   \\[\n   C_2 = 2 \\pi r_2 = 2 \\pi \\times 2 = 4\\pi \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Time for Each Bug to Complete One Full Lap\n\n1. **Time for the bug on the larger circle**:\n   Speed: \\(3\\pi\\) inches per minute. Time taken:\n   \\[\n   T_1 = \\frac{C_1}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{10\\pi}{3\\pi} = \\frac{10}{3} \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Time for the bug on the smaller circle**:\n   Speed: \\(2.5\\pi\\) inches per minute. Time taken:\n   \\[\n   T_2 = \\frac{C_2}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{4\\pi}{2.5\\pi} = \\frac{4}{2.5} = \\frac{8}{5} \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\)\n\nWe need to find the LCM of \\(T_1 = \\frac{10}{3}\\) and \\(T_2 = \\frac{8}{5}\\) by using a common denominator of 15.\n\n1. Convert \\(T_1\\):\n   \\[\n   T_1 = \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 5}{3 \\times 5} = \\frac{50}{15}\n   \\]\n   \n2. Convert \\(T_2\\):\n   \\[\n   T_2 = \\frac{8}{5} = \\frac{8 \\times 3}{5 \\times 3} = \\frac{24}{15}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the LCM of the numerators (50 and 24):\n   - **Prime Factorization**:\n     - \\(50 = 2 \\times 5^2\\)\n     - \\(24 = 2^3 \\times 3\\)\n\n   - Taking the highest powers:\n     - For \\(2\\): \\(2^3\\) (from 24)\n     - For \\(3\\): \\(3^1\\) (from 24)\n     - For \\(5\\): \\(5^2\\) (from 50)\n\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM}(50, 24) = 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 = 8 \\times 3 \\times 25 = 600\n   \\]\n\n4. Final LCM calculation:\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM} = \\frac{600}{15} = 40 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe two bugs will meet again at point P after:\n\\[\n\\boxed{40} \\text{ minutes}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The circumference of the larger circle, $C_1$, is $2\\cdot5\\pi=10\\pi$. The circumference of the smaller circle, $C_2$, is $2\\cdot2\\pi=4\\pi$. The bug on $C_1$ crawls the circumference in $\\frac{10\\pi}{3\\pi}=\\frac{10}{3}$ minutes, while the bug on $C_2$ crawls the circumference in $\\frac{4\\pi}{2.5\\pi}=\\frac{8}{5}$ minutes. The two bugs will meet at point P in some $t$ minutes, when $t\\div\\frac{10}{3}=\\frac{3t}{10}$ and $t\\div\\frac{8}{5}=\\frac{5t}{8}$ are both integers. We have $\\text{GCD}(3,10)=\\text{GCD}(5,8)=1$, so we have to find the LCM of $10=2\\cdot5$ and $8=2^3$. The LCM is $2^3\\cdot5=40$, so the bugs will next meet in $t=\\boxed{40}$ minutes."
