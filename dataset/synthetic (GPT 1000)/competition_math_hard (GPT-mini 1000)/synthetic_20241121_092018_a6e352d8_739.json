  "problem": "Spot's doghouse has a regular hexagonal base that measures one yard on each side. He is tethered to a vertex with a two-yard rope. What is the area, in square yards, of the region outside the doghouse that Spot can reach? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
  "solution": "To find the area of the region outside the doghouse that Spot can reach, we need to analyze the geometry of the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Configuration**:\n   - Spot's doghouse has a regular hexagonal base with each side measuring 1 yard. The vertices of the hexagon can be positioned on a circle with a radius of 1 yard, centered at the hexagon's center.\n   - Spot is tethered to one vertex (let's name it vertex A) by a rope that is 2 yards long.\n\n2. **Spot's Reach**:\n   - With a 2-yard tether, Spot can roam within a circle of radius 2 yards centered at vertex A. The total area of this circle is:\n     \\[\n     A_{\\text{circle}} = \\pi (2^2) = 4\\pi \\text{ square yards}.\n     \\]\n   - However, since the doghouse occupies part of this area, we need to calculate how much of the circle lies outside the hexagon.\n\n3. **Area Occluded by the Doghouse**:\n   - The angle subtended at vertex A by the opposite vertex of the hexagon is \\( 240^\\circ \\) (or \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of a full circle).\n   - Thus, the area of the sector within the 2-yard circle that Spot can access from vertex A is:\n     \\[\n     A_{\\text{sector}} = \\frac{240}{360} \\times A_{\\text{circle}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 4\\pi = \\frac{8\\pi}{3} \\text{ square yards}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Access from Adjacent Vertices**:\n   - Spot can also reach areas from the adjacent vertices (B and F), each allowing access to a \\( 60^\\circ \\) sector of a circle with a radius of 1 yard.\n   - The area of each \\( 60^\\circ \\) sector at vertices B and F is:\n     \\[\n     A_{\\text{each sector}} = \\frac{60}{360} \\times \\pi (1^2) = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi \\text{ square yards}.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the combined area from both adjacent sectors is:\n     \\[\n     A_{\\text{adjacent sectors}} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{6}\\pi = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi \\text{ square yards}.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Total Reachable Area Outside the Doghouse**:\n   - Adding the area of the \\( 240^\\circ \\) sector to the combined area of the two \\( 60^\\circ \\) sectors gives us the total reachable area outside the doghouse:\n     \\[\n     A_{\\text{total}} = A_{\\text{sector}} + A_{\\text{adjacent sectors}} = \\frac{8\\pi}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}\\pi = \\frac{9\\pi}{3} = 3\\pi \\text{ square yards}.\n     \\]\n\nThus, the area of the region outside the doghouse that Spot can reach is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3\\pi} \\text{ square yards.}\n\\]",
