  "problem": "For how many positive integers $n\\geq 2$ is $1001_n$ a prime number?",
  "solution": "To determine for how many positive integers \\( n \\geq 2 \\) the number \\( 1001_n \\) is prime, we first convert \\( 1001_n \\) from base \\( n \\) to base 10.\n\n### Step 1: Convert \\( 1001_n \\) to Base 10\n\nThe base \\( n \\) number \\( 1001_n \\) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n1001_n = 1 \\cdot n^3 + 0 \\cdot n^2 + 0 \\cdot n^1 + 1 \\cdot n^0 = n^3 + 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Problem Reformulation\n\nNow, we need to find integers \\( n \\geq 2 \\) such that \\( n^3 + 1 \\) is prime.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze \\( n^3 + 1 \\)\n\nWe can factor \\( n^3 + 1 \\) using the sum of cubes formula:\n\n\\[\nn^3 + 1 = (n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Conditions for Primality\n\nFor \\( n^3 + 1 \\) to be prime, one of its factors must equal 1. Let's analyze our factors:\n\n1. For \\( n + 1 = 1 \\):\n   - This cannot occur for \\( n \\geq 2\\) since \\( n + 1 \\) would be at least 3.\n  \n2. For \\( n^2 - n + 1 = 1 \\):\n   - Solving \\( n^2 - n + 1 = 1 \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   n^2 - n = 0 \\implies n(n - 1) = 0\n   \\]\n   - This results in \\( n = 0 \\) or \\( n = 1\\), both of which are invalid since \\( n \\) must be at least 2.\n\n### Step 5: Checking Small Values of \\( n \\)\n\nSince neither factor can equal 1 for \\( n \\geq 2 \\), we will check small integer values of \\( n \\) directly:\n\n- \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 1001_2 = 2^3 + 1 = 9\\) (not prime)\n- \\( n = 3 \\): \\( 1001_3 = 3^3 + 1 = 28\\) (not prime)\n- \\( n = 4 \\): \\( 1001_4 = 4^3 + 1 = 65\\) (not prime)\n- \\( n = 5 \\): \\( 1001_5 = 5^3 + 1 = 126\\) (not prime)\n- \\( n = 6 \\): \\( 1001_6 = 6^3 + 1 = 217\\) (not prime)\n- \\( n = 7 \\): \\( 1001_7 = 7^3 + 1 = 344\\) (not prime)\n- \\( n = 8 \\): \\( 1001_8 = 8^3 + 1 = 513\\) (not prime)\n- \\( n = 9 \\): \\( 1001_9 = 9^3 + 1 = 730\\) (not prime)\n- \\( n = 10 \\): \\( 1001_{10} = 10^3 + 1 = 1001\\) (not prime)\n\nContinuing to check subsequent values yields no primes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince we've established that neither factor can lead to a prime \\( n^3 + 1 \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\) and empirical checks for small \\( n \\) confirm non-primality, we conclude:\n\n\\[\n\\text{There are no values of } n \\geq 2 \\text{ such that } 1001_n \\text{ is a prime number.}\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>0</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We see that the given number is equal to $1 \\cdot n^3 + 1 = n^3 + 1$. Using the sum of cubes factorization, it follows that $n^3 + 1 = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$. Since $1$ is a digit in the base, then $n > 1$, and $n+1 > 1$ and $n^2 - n + 1 > n - n + 1 = 1$, so $n^3 + 1$ is the product of two integers greater than $1$. Thus, $1001_n$ is prime for $\\boxed{0}$ values of $n$."
