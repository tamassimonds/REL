  "problem": "Points $A(3,5)$ and $B(7,10)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of a circle graphed in a coordinate plane. How many square units are in the area of the circle? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
  "solution": "To find the area of a circle with endpoints of its diameter at points \\(A(3,5)\\) and \\(B(7,10)\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the diameter's length:**\n   We use the distance formula to find the distance \\(d\\) between points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the coordinates of points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{(7 - 3)^2 + (10 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{(4)^2 + (5)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 25} = \\sqrt{41}\n   \\]\n   Thus, the length of the diameter is \\(\\sqrt{41}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the radius:**\n   The radius \\(r\\) is half of the diameter:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the area of the circle:**\n   The area \\(A\\) of the circle is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting for \\(r\\):\n   \\[\n   A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{41}{4}\\right) = \\frac{41\\pi}{4}\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the area of the circle is \\(\\frac{41\\pi}{4}\\) square units. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>\\(\\frac{41\\pi}{4}\\)</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We must find the radius of the circle in order to find the area. We are told that points $A$ and $B$ are the endpoints of a diameter, so we can find the distance between these two points. We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(7-3)^2 + (10-5)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 25} = \\sqrt{41}$.\n\nSince the diameter has a length of $\\sqrt{41}$, the radius must have length $\\sqrt{41}/2$. Therefore, the answer is $(\\sqrt{41}/2)^2\\pi = \\boxed{\\frac{41\\pi}{4}}$."
