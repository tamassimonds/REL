  "problem": "A swimming pool can be filled by any of three hoses A, B or C. Hoses A and B together take 4 hours to fill the pool. Hoses A and C together take 5 hours to fill the pool. Hoses B and C together take 6 hours to fill the pool. How many hours does it take hoses A, B and C working together to fill the pool? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
  "solution": "To determine how long it takes for hoses A, B, and C to fill a swimming pool together, we will calculate their individual filling rates based on the provided information.\n\n1. **Calculate hoses' rates**:\n   - Let \\( r_A \\) be the rate of hose A (in pools per hour), \\( r_B \\) be the rate of hose B, and \\( r_C \\) be the rate of hose C.\n   - From the problem statement:\n     - Hoses A and B together fill the pool in 4 hours:\n       \\[\n       r_A + r_B = \\frac{1}{4} \\quad (1)\n       \\]\n     - Hoses A and C together fill the pool in 5 hours:\n       \\[\n       r_A + r_C = \\frac{1}{5} \\quad (2)\n       \\]\n     - Hoses B and C together fill the pool in 6 hours:\n       \\[\n       r_B + r_C = \\frac{1}{6} \\quad (3)\n       \\]\n\n2. **Formulate the equations**:\n   We now have the following system of equations:\n   \\[\n   r_A + r_B = \\frac{1}{4} \\quad (1)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r_A + r_C = \\frac{1}{5} \\quad (2)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r_B + r_C = \\frac{1}{6} \\quad (3)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Isolate variables**:\n   From equation (1), we can express \\( r_B \\):\n   \\[\n   r_B = \\frac{1}{4} - r_A \\quad (4)\n   \\]\n   Substituting equation (4) into equation (3):\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{4} - r_A\\right) + r_C = \\frac{1}{6}\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   r_C = \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{4} + r_A\n   \\]\n   Finding a common denominator (12):\n   \\[\n   r_C = \\frac{2}{12} - \\frac{3}{12} + r_A = r_A - \\frac{1}{12} \\quad (5)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute into equation (2)**:\n   Now substitute equation (5) into equation (2):\n   \\[\n   r_A + \\left(r_A - \\frac{1}{12}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5}\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   2r_A - \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{5}\n   \\]\n   Multiplying through by 60 (the least common multiple of the denominators):\n   \\[\n   120r_A - 5 = 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   120r_A = 17 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r_A = \\frac{17}{120}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine rates for B and C**:\n   Substitute \\( r_A \\) back into equations (4) and (5) to find \\( r_B \\) and \\( r_C \\):\n   \\[\n   r_B = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{17}{120} = \\frac{30}{120} - \\frac{17}{120} = \\frac{13}{120}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r_C = \\frac{17}{120} - \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{17}{120} - \\frac{10}{120} = \\frac{7}{120}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Sum the rates**:\n   The combined rate of hoses A, B, and C is:\n   \\[\n   r_{total} = r_A + r_B + r_C = \\frac{17}{120} + \\frac{13}{120} + \\frac{7}{120} = \\frac{37}{120}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the time to fill the pool**:\n   The time taken to fill the pool together is the reciprocal of the combined rate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time} = \\frac{1}{r_{total}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{37}{120}} = \\frac{120}{37}\n   \\]\n   Computing \\( \\frac{120}{37} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{120}{37} \\approx 3.2432 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{Rounded to the nearest hundredth:} \\quad 3.24 \\text{ hours}.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER> 3.24 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let the rate that hose $A$ fills the pool be equal to $A$, and similarly for hoses $B$ and $C$.  Then, let $P$ be equal to the volume of the pool.  From the given information, we can write the equation $P=4(A+B)$, which just says the pool volume is equal to the rate it is being filled, multiplied by the time taken to fill it.  We can rewrite this as $\\frac{P}{4}=A+B$.  Doing this with the rest of the given information, we can write three equations: $$\\frac{P}{4}=A+B$$ $$\\frac{P}{5}=A+C$$ $$\\frac{P}{6}=B+C$$ Adding these three equations, we can simplify as shown: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{P}{4}+\\frac{P}{5}+\\frac{P}{6}&=(A+B)+(A+C)+(B+C)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{15P}{60}+\\frac{12P}{60}+\\frac{10P}{60}&=2(A+B+C)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 37P&=120(A+B+C)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad P&=\\frac{120}{37}(A+B+C)\n\\end{align*} Looking carefully at the final expression here, we can see that $A+B+C$ is the rate that the pool would be filled with all three hoses working together.  So, $\\frac{120}{37}\\approx \\boxed{3.24}$ is equal to the number of hours it would take all three hoses to fill the pool."
