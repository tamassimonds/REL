  "problem": "The expansion of $(x+1)^n$ has 3 consecutive terms with coefficients in the ratio $1:2:3$ that can be written in the form\\[{n\\choose k} : {n\\choose k+1} : {n \\choose k+2}\\]Find the sum of all possible values of $n+k$.\n",
  "solution": "To determine the values of \\( n \\) and \\( k \\) such that the coefficients of three consecutive terms in the expansion of \\( (x + 1)^n \\) are in the ratio \\( 1:2:3 \\), we analyze the coefficients represented by the binomial coefficients \\( {n \\choose k} \\), \\( {n \\choose k+1} \\), and \\( {n \\choose k+2} \\).\n\nWe can express the ratios mathematically as follows:\n\n1. From the first ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{{n \\choose k+1}}{{n \\choose k}} = 2\n   \\]\n   which leads to the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n - k}{k + 1} = 2\n   \\]\n   Rearranging yields:\n   \\[\n   n - k = 2(k + 1) \\implies n = 3k + 2 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n   \\]\n\n2. From the second ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{{n \\choose k+2}}{{n \\choose k+1}} = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n   leading to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{n - (k + 1)}{k + 2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n   Cross multiplying gives:\n   \\[\n   2(n - k - 1) = 3(k + 2)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying results in:\n   \\[\n   2n = 5k + 8 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n   \\]\n\n### Solving the Equations\n\nNow, we will solve equations (1) and (2) simultaneously. Substituting \\( n = 3k + 2 \\) from equation (1) into equation (2):\n\n\\[\n2(3k + 2) = 5k + 8\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying yields:\n\\[\n6k + 4 = 5k + 8\n\\]\nRearranging gives:\n\\[\nk = 4\n\\]\n\n### Finding \\( n \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( k = 4 \\) back into equation (1) to find \\( n \\):\n\\[\nn = 3(4) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14\n\\]\n\n### Calculating \\( n + k \\)\n\nWe can now calculate \\( n + k \\):\n\\[\nn + k = 14 + 4 = 18\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThrough our analysis, we established that the values we derived for \\( n \\) and \\( k \\) satisfy the conditions provided. Thus, the sum \\( n + k \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Final Answer: } \\boxed{18}\n\\] \n\nThis solution confirms the values of \\( n \\) and \\( k \\) are correct, with no other combinations producing different non-negative integer solutions that maintain the specified ratios.",
  "ground_truth": "By definition, ${n\\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. The ratio of the first two terms give us that\\begin{align*}\\frac{1}{2} &= \\frac{\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}}{\\frac{n!}{(k+1)!(n-k-1)!}} = \\frac{k+1}{n-k}\\\\ 2&=n-3k\\end{align*}The ratio of the second and third terms give us that\\begin{align*}\\frac{2}{3} &= \\frac{\\frac{n!}{(k+1)!(n-k-1)!}}{\\frac{n!}{(k+2)!(n-k-2)!}} = \\frac{k+2}{n-k-1}\\\\ 8&=2n-5k\\end{align*}This is a linear system of two equations with two unknowns, indicating that there is a unique solution. Solving by substitution or multiplying the top equation and subtracting, we find $k = 4, n = 14$. Thus, $n+k=\\boxed{18}$."
