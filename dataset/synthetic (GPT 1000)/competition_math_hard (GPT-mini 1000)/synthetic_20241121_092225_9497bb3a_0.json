  "problem": "Stan drove 300 miles in 5 hours, 20 minutes. Next, he drove 360 miles in 6 hours, 40 minutes. What was Stan's average speed in miles per hour for the total trip?",
  "solution": "To calculate Stan's average speed for his trip, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Convert Driving Times to Decimal Hours\nWe first need to convert the driving times from hours and minutes into decimal hours.\n\n1. **First trip**: 5 hours and 20 minutes\n   - Convert the 20 minutes into hours:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{20}{60} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n   - Total time for the first trip:\n     \\[\n     5 + 0.3333 = 5.3333 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Second trip**: 6 hours and 40 minutes\n   - Convert the 40 minutes into hours:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{40}{60} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.6667 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n   - Total time for the second trip:\n     \\[\n     6 + 0.6667 = 6.6667 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Distance and Time\nNext, we determine the total distance traveled and the total time spent on the trip.\n\n- **Total distance**:\n  \\[\n  300 \\text{ miles} + 360 \\text{ miles} = 660 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n\n- **Total time**:\n  \\[\n  5.3333 \\text{ hours} + 6.6667 \\text{ hours} = 12 \\text{ hours}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Average Speed\nTo find the average speed for the total trip, we use the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n\\]\nSubstituting in our values:\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{660 \\text{ miles}}{12 \\text{ hours}} = 55 \\text{ miles per hour}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nConsequently, Stan's average speed for the entire trip was 55 miles per hour.\n\nIn the required format, the answer is:\n<ANSWER>55 miles per hour</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Average speed is defined as total distance traveled divided by time traveled. In total, Stan drove 660 miles and it took him 12 hours. His average speed was $660/12=600/12+60/12=50+5=\\boxed{55}$ miles per hour."
