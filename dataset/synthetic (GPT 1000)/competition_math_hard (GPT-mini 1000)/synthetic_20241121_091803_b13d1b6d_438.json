  "problem": "Henry's Hamburger Heaven offers its hamburgers with the following condiments: ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, tomato, lettuce, pickles, cheese, and onions. A customer can choose one, two, or three meat patties, and any collection of condiments. How many different kinds of hamburgers can be ordered?",
  "solution": "To determine the total number of different kinds of hamburgers at Henry's Hamburger Heaven, we need to look at two main factors: the choice of meat patties and the choice of condiments.\n\n### Step 1: Choosing Meat Patties\nCustomers can select from three options for meat patties: one, two, or three. This gives us **3 choices** for the meat patties.\n\n### Step 2: Choosing Condiments\nNext, we consider the 8 available condiments: \n- ketchup\n- mustard\n- mayonnaise\n- tomato\n- lettuce\n- pickles\n- cheese\n- onions\n\nCustomers can choose any combination of these condiments, including the option of selecting none at all. Each condiment can either be included or not, leading to \\(2^n\\) combinations, where \\(n\\) is the total number of condiments. In this case, with 8 condiments:\n\n\\[\n2^8 = 256\n\\]\n\nThis count includes all possibilities, from choosing no condiments (1 option) to selecting all 8.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating Total Hamburger Combinations\nTo find the total number of different hamburgers, we multiply the choices for meat patties by the choices for condiments:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Hamburgers} = \\text{Choices of Meat Patties} \\times \\text{Choices of Condiments}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Hamburgers} = 3 \\text{ (meat patty choices)} \\times 256 \\text{ (condiment combinations)} = 768\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the total number of different kinds of hamburgers that can be ordered is **768**.",
  "ground_truth": "A customer makes one of two choices for each condiment, to include it or not to include it. The choices are made independently, so there are $2^8 = 256$ possible combinations of condiments. For each of those combinations there are three choices regarding the number of meat patties, so there are altogether $(3)(256)=\\boxed{768}$ different kinds of hamburgers."
