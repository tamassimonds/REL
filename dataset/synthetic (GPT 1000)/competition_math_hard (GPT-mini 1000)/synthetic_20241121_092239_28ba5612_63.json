  "problem": "The asymptotes of a hyperbola are $y = x + 1$ and $y = 3 - x.$  Also, the hyperbola passes through $(3,3).$  Find the distance between the foci of the hyperbola.",
  "solution": "To find the equation of the hyperbola given its asymptotes and a point through which it passes, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Asymptotes**:\n   The equations of the asymptotes are:\n   \\[\n   y = x + 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = 3 - x.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the Center**:\n   The center of the hyperbola is located at the intersection of its asymptotes. Solving for their intersection:\n   \\[\n   x + 1 = 3 - x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2x = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 1.\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(x = 1\\) into one of the equations to find \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   y = 1 + 1 = 2,\n   \\]\n   gives us the center \\((1, 2)\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Orientation**:\n   The slopes of the asymptotes are \\(1\\) and \\(-1\\), indicating the hyperbola opens horizontally. The standard form of the hyperbola is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1 \\quad \\text{where} \\quad (h, k) = (1, 2).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Relate \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**:\n   The relationship from the asymptotes tells us:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a}{b} = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = b.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Equation of the Hyperbola**:\n   Substituting the center and the relationship into the standard form gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(x - 1)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y - 2)^2}{a^2} = 1.\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   (x - 1)^2 - (y - 2)^2 = a^2.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Substituting the Point (3, 3)**:\n   Plugging in the point \\((3, 3)\\) that the hyperbola passes through:\n   \\[\n   (3 - 1)^2 - (3 - 2)^2 = a^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2^2 - 1^2 = a^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 4 - 1 = a^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a^2 = 3.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Finalization of the Equation**:\n   Thus, the updated equation of the hyperbola is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(x - 1)^2}{3} - \\frac{(y - 2)^2}{3} = 1,\n   \\]\n   which can also be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   (x - 1)^2 - (y - 2)^2 = 3.\n   \\]\n\n8. **Distance Between the Foci**:\n   The distance between the foci of a hyperbola is given by:\n   \\[\n   2c = 2\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 2\\sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = 2\\sqrt{2a^2} = 2a\\sqrt{2}.\n   \\]\n   With \\(a^2 = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   2c = 2 \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 3} = 2\\sqrt{6}.\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**: The distance between the foci of the hyperbola is \\(2\\sqrt{6}\\).",
  "ground_truth": "The intersection of the asymptotes is $(1,2),$ so this is the center of the hyperbola.  Since the slopes of the asymptotes are $\\pm 1,$ the equation of the hyperbola can be written in the form\n\\[(x - 1)^2 - (y - 2)^2 = d\\]for some constant $d.$  Setting $x = 3$ and $y = 3,$ we get $d = 3,$ so the equation is\n\\[\\frac{(x - 1)^2}{3} - \\frac{(y - 2)^2}{3} = 1.\\]Then $a^2 = 3$ and $b^2 = 3,$ so $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 6,$ which means $c = \\sqrt{6}.$  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = \\boxed{2 \\sqrt{6}}.$"
