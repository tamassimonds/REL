  "problem": "How many non-congruent triangles with only integer side lengths have a perimeter of 15 units?",
  "solution": "To find the number of non-congruent triangles with integer side lengths that have a perimeter of 15 units, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Sides**:\n   Let the sides of the triangle be denoted as \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), where \\( a \\leq b \\leq c \\) to ensure non-congruence. The perimeter condition gives us:\n   \\[\n   a + b + c = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the Triangle Inequalities**:\n   The triangle inequality states:\n   - \\( a + b > c \\)\n   - \\( a + c > b \\)\n   - \\( b + c > a \\)\n\n   Focusing on the most relevant inequality \\( a + b > c \\), we can substitute from the perimeter:\n   \\[\n   a + b = 15 - c \\implies 15 - c > c \\implies 15 > 2c \\implies c < 7.5\n   \\]\n   Since \\( c \\) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \\( c \\) is 7. Thus, \\( c \\) can take values 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Evaluate Cases for Each Possible Value of \\( c \\)**:\n   \n   - **Case 1: \\( c = 7 \\)**:\n     \\[\n     a + b = 15 - 7 = 8\n     \\]\n     The side lengths must satisfy \\( a + b > 7 \\) (which holds since \\( a + b = 8 \\)). The valid combinations for \\( (a, b) \\) are:\n     - \\( (1, 7) \\)\n     - \\( (2, 6) \\)\n     - \\( (3, 5) \\)\n     - \\( (4, 4) \\)\n\n     Resulting triangles are \\( (1, 7, 7) \\), \\( (2, 6, 7) \\), \\( (3, 5, 7) \\), and \\( (4, 4, 7) \\) \u2192 4 valid triangles.\n\n   - **Case 2: \\( c = 6 \\)**:\n     \\[\n     a + b = 15 - 6 = 9\n     \\]\n     Here \\( a + b > 6 \\) is satisfied. The pairs \\( (a, b) \\) satisfying \\( a + b = 9 \\) are:\n     - \\( (3, 6) \\)\n     - \\( (4, 5) \\)\n\n     This gives us triangles \\( (3, 6, 6) \\) and \\( (4, 5, 6) \\) \u2192 2 valid triangles.\n\n   - **Case 3: \\( c = 5 \\)**:\n     \\[\n     a + b = 15 - 5 = 10\n     \\]\n     Here \\( a + b > 5 \\) is satisfied. The only pair \\( (a, b) \\) satisfying this is:\n     - \\( (5, 5) \\)\n\n     This results in the triangle \\( (5, 5, 5) \\) \u2192 1 valid triangle.\n\n4. **Count Total Non-Congruent Triangles**:\n   - From **Case 1 (c = 7)**: 4 triangles\n   - From **Case 2 (c = 6)**: 2 triangles\n   - From **Case 3 (c = 5)**: 1 triangle\n\nAdding them together, we have:\n\\[\n4 + 2 + 1 = 7\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of non-congruent triangles with integer side lengths and a perimeter of 15 is **7**.",
  "ground_truth": "In a triangle, the lengths of any two sides must add up to a value larger than the third length's side.  This is known as the Triangle Inequality.  Keeping this in mind, we list out cases based on the length of the shortest side.\n\nCase 1:  shortest side has length $1$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $7$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{1,7,7\\}$.\n\nCase 2:  shortest side has length $2$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $6$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{2,6,7\\}$.\n\nCase 3:  shortest side has length $3$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $6$ and $6$ or $5$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{3,6,6\\}$ and $\\{3,5,7\\}$.\n\nCase 4:  shortest side has length $4$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $5$ and $6$ or $4$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{4,5,6\\}$ and $\\{4,4,7\\}$.\n\nCase 5:  shortest side has length $5$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $5$ and $5$.  This leads to the set $\\{5,5,5\\}$.\n\nHence there are $\\boxed{7}$ sets of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of $15$ units."
