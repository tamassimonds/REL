  "problem": "I have five apples and ten oranges. If a fruit basket must contain at least one piece of fruit, how many kinds of fruit baskets can I make?  (The apples are identical and the oranges are identical.  A fruit basket consists of some number of pieces of fruit, and it doesn't matter how the fruit are arranged in the basket.)",
  "solution": "To determine the number of different types of fruit baskets that can be created from five identical apples and ten identical oranges, we can follow this streamlined approach:\n\n1. **Define the Problem**: We need to form fruit baskets containing at least one fruit (either an apple or an orange).\n\n2. **Choices for Apples**: We can select between 0 and 5 apples, giving us a total of:\n   - 0 apples\n   - 1 apple\n   - 2 apples\n   - 3 apples\n   - 4 apples\n   - 5 apples\n   This results in **6 possible choices for apples**.\n\n3. **Choices for Oranges**: Similarly, we can choose from 0 to 10 oranges, resulting in:\n   - 0 oranges\n   - 1 orange\n   - 2 oranges\n   - 3 oranges\n   - 4 oranges\n   - 5 oranges\n   - 6 oranges\n   - 7 oranges\n   - 8 oranges\n   - 9 oranges\n   - 10 oranges\n   This gives us **11 possible choices for oranges**.\n\n4. **Total Combinations**: To find the total number of ways to choose apples and oranges, we multiply the number of choices for each:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total combinations} = 6 \\times 11 = 66\n   \\]\n\n5. **Exclude the Empty Basket**: Since we must have at least one fruit, we need to subtract the scenario where both apples and oranges are 0 (the empty basket):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Valid combinations} = 66 - 1 = 65\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Count**: In conclusion, the total number of different types of fruit baskets that can be formed is **65**.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>65</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "For a moment, consider empty fruit baskets. Now there are $6$ choices total for the apples: no apples, one apple, two apples, three, four, or all five apples. Similarly, there are $11$ choices total for the oranges. Thus, there are $6\\cdot 11 = 66$ potential fruit baskets. But we must subtract one off of that because we counted empty fruit baskets, which aren't actually allowed. So there are $\\boxed{65}$ possible fruit baskets."
