  "solution": "To find the perimeter of the region enclosed by semicircular arcs on the sides of a square with a side length of \\( \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Radius of the Semicircles**:  \n   Each semicircle is based on a side of the square, which is \\( \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\). The radius \\( r \\) of each semicircle is half the diameter (the side length of the square):\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{\\pi} = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Length of One Semicircle**:  \n   The circumference \\( C \\) of a full circle is given by \\( C = 2\\pi r \\). For a semicircle, we take half of this value:\n   \\[\n   C_{\\text{semicircle}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2\\pi r = \\pi r\n   \\]\n   Substituting in our radius, we find:\n   \\[\n   C_{\\text{semicircle}} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\right) = 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Perimeter from All Semicircles**:  \n   Since there are 4 semicircles (one on each side of the square), the total perimeter contributed by the semicircles is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total perimeter} = 4 \\times C_{\\text{semicircle}} = 4 \\times 1 = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:  \n   The final perimeter of the region bounded by the semicircular arcs is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter} = 4\n   \\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<ANSWER>4 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since the square has side length $2/\\pi$,  the diameter of each circular section is $2/\\pi$. The boundary of the region consists of  4 semicircles, whose total perimeter is twice the circumference of a  circle having  diameter $2/\\pi$. Hence the perimeter of the region is \\[\n2\\cdot \\left(\\pi\\cdot \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right) = \\boxed{4}.\n\\]"
