  "problem": "A baseball league has nine teams. During the season, each of the nine teams plays exactly three games with each of the other teams. What is the total number of games played?",
  "solution": "To determine the total number of games played in a baseball league with nine teams, each playing three games against every other team, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Number of Teams\nThere are 9 teams in the league.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Games Played Between Teams\nEach team plays 3 games with each of the other teams.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Unique Team Pairings\nTo find the number of unique pairs of teams, we use the combinations formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of unique pairings} = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( n = 9 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{2} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2} = 36\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Total Games Played\nSince each of the 36 unique pairs plays 3 games, the total number of games can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total games} = \\text{Number of unique pairings} \\times \\text{Games per pairing} \n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total games} = 36 \\times 3 = 108\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the total number of games played in the league is **108**. \n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>108</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Suppose each team played just one game with each of the remaining teams. Then each of the nine teams plays eight games. This makes a total of $9 \\times 8$ or 72 games. However each game has been counted twice in this total. For example, the game between Team A and Team B appears in A's 8 games and also B's 8 games. Therefore there are $9 \\times \\frac{8}{2} = 36$ different games played. Since each game is played three times, the total number of games played is $3 \\times 36 = \\boxed{108}$."
