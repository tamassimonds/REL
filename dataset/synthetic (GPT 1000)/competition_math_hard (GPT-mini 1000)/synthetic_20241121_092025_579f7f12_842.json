  "problem": "What is the greatest number of points of intersection that can occur when $2$ different circles and $2$ different straight lines are drawn on the same piece of paper?",
  "solution": "To find the maximum number of points of intersection with 2 different circles and 2 different straight lines, we can break the problem down into several clear steps:\n\n**Step 1: Circle Intersections**  \nTwo distinct circles can intersect at a maximum of 2 points.  \n- **Maximum intersections from circles = 2**\n\n**Step 2: Line Intersections**  \nTwo distinct lines can intersect at a maximum of 1 point.  \n- **Maximum intersections from lines = 1**\n\n**Step 3: Intersections Between Circles and Lines**  \nA single line can intersect a circle at a maximum of 2 points. Therefore, for 2 lines and 2 circles, we calculate the intersections as follows:\n\n- **For each line with one circle:** 2 intersection points.  \n- **For 2 lines with one circle:** \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) intersection points.  \n- Since we have 2 circles, the calculation for the second circle is the same:  \n- **For 2 lines with the second circle:** another \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) intersection points.  \n\nAdding these gives:\n- **Total intersections from circles and lines = 4 + 4 = 8**\n\n**Step 4: Total Intersections**  \nNow we can add all the maximum intersection points together:\n- **Total intersections = Intersections from circles + Intersections from lines + Intersections from circles and lines**  \n- **Total intersections = 2 + 1 + 8 = 11**\n\nThus, the greatest number of points of intersection that can occur with 2 different circles and 2 different straight lines is **11**.",
