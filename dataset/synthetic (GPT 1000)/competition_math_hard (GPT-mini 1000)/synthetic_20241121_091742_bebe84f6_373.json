  "problem": "Suppose we flip four coins simultaneously: a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter.  What is the probability that the penny and dime both come up the same?",
  "solution": "To find the probability that the penny and dime both show the same result when flipping four coins (a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Outcomes for each coin**: Each coin (penny, nickel, dime, quarter) can either show 'Heads' (H) or 'Tails' (T), giving each coin two possible outcomes.\n\n2. **Total combinations of outcomes**: With four coins, each having 2 outcomes, the total number of combinations when flipping all four coins is:\n   \\[\n   2^4 = 16\n   \\]\n\n3. **Condition for penny and dime**: For the penny and dime to be the same, both must show either Heads or Tails.\n\n4. **Count favorable outcomes for penny and dime**: There are 2 favorable outcomes where the penny and dime match: both show Heads (H, H) or both show Tails (T, T).\n\n5. **Consider other coins**: The outcomes of the nickel and quarter are independent of the penny and dime. Since each of these two coins also has 2 outcomes, the total combinations for the nickel and quarter are:\n   \\[\n   2^2 = 4\n   \\]\n\n6. **Total favorable outcomes**: Since there are 2 ways for the penny and dime to be the same and 4 possible combinations for the nickel and quarter, the total number of favorable outcomes is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that the penny and dime match is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total outcomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the probability that the penny and dime both come up the same is:\n\n<ANSWER> 1/2 </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails).  There are 2 possibilities for the penny and the dime: either they're both heads or they're both tails.  There are also 2 possibilities for the nickel and 2 possibilities for the quarter.  So there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$ successful outcomes, and the probability of success is $\\dfrac{8}{16} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$."
