  "solution": "To find the maximum possible number of points \\( m \\) in a growing path within a \\( 4 \\times 4 \\) grid of points, and the number of such paths \\( r \\) that consist of exactly \\( m \\) points, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Grid\nThe grid consists of \\( 4 \\times 4 \\) points, where each point can be represented by coordinates \\((i, j)\\) for \\( i, j = 0, 1, 2, 3\\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Possible Distances\nThe distance \\( d \\) between any two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is defined as:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\nIn this grid, the possible distances between points include:\n- \\(1\\) (adjacent horizontally or vertically)\n- \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) (diagonal)\n- \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) (2 units in one direction and 1 in another)\n- \\(2\\) (directly 2 units away)\n- \\(\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\) (two diagonal moves)\n- Additional distances like \\(\\sqrt{10}\\), \\(\\sqrt{13}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{18}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Exploring Growing Paths\nA growing path consists of a sequence of distinct points where the distances between consecutive points are strictly increasing. Start examining paths from corners or edges, as these points are more likely to connect to multiple others.\n\n### Step 4: Construct a Valid Path\n1. Begin at \\((0,0)\\). The first move can be to an adjacent point, such as \\((0,1)\\) (distance \\(1\\)).\n2. Next, move to \\((1,1)\\) (distance \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)) from \\((0,1)\\).\n3. Instead of going to \\((2,2)\\) (which maintains \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)), opt for \\((1,3)\\) (distance \\(\\sqrt{5}\\)).\n4. By continuing this process and exploring various combinations, we identify paths that maximize the number of steps.\n\n### Step 5: Maximize Length \\( m \\)\nUpon evaluating various sequences, we determine that the maximum number of points \\( m \\) in a growing path is **10**.\n\n### Step 6: Count Possible Growing Paths \\( r \\)\nTo count how many distinct paths achieve this maximum length:\n- Starting from any corner (e.g., \\((0,0)\\) to \\((3,3)\\)), we can explore different sequences while ensuring they meet the distance criteria.\n- By systematically examining all potential paths and leveraging symmetry, we find there are \\( r = 24 \\) different ways to arrange these paths.\n\n### Final Calculation\nTo calculate \\( mr \\):\n\\[\nmr = 10 \\times 24 = 240\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{240}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "We label our points using coordinates $0 \\le x,y \\le 3$, with the bottom-left point being $(0,0)$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance between two points is $\\sqrt{d_x^2 + d_y^2}$ where $0 \\le d_x, d_y \\le 3$; these yield the possible distances (in decreasing order)\\[\\sqrt{18},\\ \\sqrt{13},\\ \\sqrt{10},\\ \\sqrt{9},\\ \\sqrt{8},\\ \\sqrt{5},\\ \\sqrt{4},\\ \\sqrt{2},\\ \\sqrt{1}\\]As these define $9$ lengths, so the maximum value of $m$ is $10$. For now, we assume that $m = 10$ is achievable. Because it is difficult to immediately impose restrictions on a path with increasing distances, we consider the paths in shrinking fashion. Note that the shrinking paths and growing paths are equivalent, but there are restrictions upon the locations of the first edges of the former.\nThe $\\sqrt{18}$ length is only possible for one of the long diagonals, so our path must start with one of the $4$ corners of the grid. Without loss of generality (since the grid is rotationally symmetric), we let the vertex be $(0,0)$ and the endpoint be $(3,3)$.\n[asy] unitsize(0.25inch); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)); dotfactor = 4; pen s = linewidth(4);  int i, j; for(i = 0; i < 4; ++i) \tfor(j = 0; j < 4; ++j) \t\tdot(((real)i, (real)j)); dot((0,0)^^(3,3),s); draw((0,0)--(3,3));  [/asy]\nThe $\\sqrt{13}$ length can now only go to $2$ points; due to reflectional symmetry about the main diagonal, we may WLOG let the next endpoint be $(1,0)$.\n[asy] unitsize(0.25inch); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)); dotfactor = 4; pen s = linewidth(4); pen c = rgb(0.5,0.5,0.5); int i, j; for(i = 0; i < 4; ++i) \tfor(j = 0; j < 4; ++j) \t\tdot(((real)i, (real)j)); dot((0,0)^^(3,3)^^(1,0),s); draw((0,0)--(3,3),c); draw((3,3)--(1,0));  [/asy]\nFrom $(1,0)$, there are two possible ways to move $\\sqrt{10}$ away, either to $(0,3)$ or $(2,3)$.
