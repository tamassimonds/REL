  "problem": "The number $1000!$ has a long tail of zeroes. How many zeroes are there?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.)",
  "solution": "To find the number of trailing zeroes in \\(1000!\\), we need to determine how many times \\(10\\) can be factored from \\(1000!\\). Since \\(10\\) is composed of the factors \\(2\\) and \\(5\\), and there are usually more \\(2s\\) than \\(5s\\) in factorials, we focus on counting the number of \\(5s\\) in the prime factorization of \\(1000!\\).\n\nThe number of trailing zeroes in \\(n!\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of trailing zeroes} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nWe continue this process until \\(5^k\\) exceeds \\(n\\).\n\nFor \\(n = 1000\\), we perform the following calculations:\n\n1. First, we calculate \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{5} \\right\\rfloor\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 200 \\right\\rfloor = 200\n   \\]\n   \n2. Next, we calculate \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{5^2} \\right\\rfloor\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{25} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 40 \\right\\rfloor = 40\n   \\]\n   \n3. Then, we calculate \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{5^3} \\right\\rfloor\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{125} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 8 \\right\\rfloor = 8\n   \\]\n   \n4. Next, we calculate \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{5^4} \\right\\rfloor\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{625} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 1.6 \\right\\rfloor = 1\n   \\]\n\n5. Finally, we calculate \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{5^5} \\right\\rfloor\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{3125} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 0.32 \\right\\rfloor = 0\n   \\]\n\nNow, we sum all these results:\n\\[\n200 + 40 + 8 + 1 + 0 = 249\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of trailing zeroes in \\(1000!\\) is \\(249\\).\n\n<ANSWER>249 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $1000!$. Since $10=2\\cdot5$, we need to count how many of each there are. We're going to have more $2$s than $5$s, so we actually only need to count how many times $5$ appears in the prime factorization.\n\nTo count how many times a number is divisible by $5$, we divide $1000$ by $5$ to get $200$. Each of those two hundred numbers has a factor of $5$.\n\nNext, how many of the numbers are divisible by $5^2=25$? Dividing $1000$ by $25$, we get $40$. Each of them has two factors of $5$. We've already counted one of them for each number, so for these forty multiples of $25$, we need to add a factor for each to our count.\n\nNext, we need to look at numbers that have $5^3=125$ in them. Eight of our numbers are divisible by $125$, so we count $8$ more factors of $5$.\n\nFinally, we look at $5^4=625$. There is only one number among $1$ through $1000$ divisible by $625$, and that number is $625$, so we only need to count one more factor of $5$. Since $5^5$ is too big, we can stop here.\n\nThis gives a total of $200+40+8+1=249$ factors of $5$ in $1000!$, so it has $\\boxed{249}$ zeroes on the end."
