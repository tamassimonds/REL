  "problem": "What is the product of the numerator and the denominator when $0.\\overline{009}$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms?",
  "solution": "To convert the repeating decimal \\( 0.\\overline{009} \\) into a fraction, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the repeating decimal:** Let \\( x = 0.\\overline{009} \\).\n\n2. **Multiply by a power of 10:** Since \"009\" has 3 digits, multiply \\( x \\) by 1000 to shift the decimal point:\n   \\[\n   1000x = 9.\\overline{009}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set up the equation:** Now we can express the left-hand side using \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   1000x = 9 + x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rearrange the equation:** Subtract \\( x \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   999x = 9\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):** Divide both sides by 999 to isolate \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{9}{999}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplify the fraction:** Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9 and 999, which is 9:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{9 \\div 9}{999 \\div 9} = \\frac{1}{111}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Determine the numerator and denominator:** The simplified fraction is \\( \\frac{1}{111} \\).\n\n8. **Calculate the product:** The numerator is 1 and the denominator is 111, so the product is:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 111 = 111\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the product of the numerator and the denominator is \\( 111 \\). \n\n**Final answer:** <ANSWER>111 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x=0.\\overline{009}$. Then $1000x=9.\\overline{009}$ and $1000x-x=999x=9$. Therefore, $0.\\overline{009}=\\frac{9}{999}$, which in lowest terms is $\\frac{1}{111}$. The product of the numerator and the denominator is $1\\cdot 111=\\boxed{111}$."
