  "problem": "In a shooting match, eight clay targets are arranged in two hanging columns of three targets each and one column of two targets. A marksman is to break all the targets according to the following rules:\n1) The marksman first chooses a column from which a target is to be broken.\n2) The marksman must then break the lowest remaining target in the chosen column.\nIf the rules are followed, in how many different orders can the eight targets be broken?\n",
  "solution": "To determine the number of different orders in which a marksman can break eight clay targets arranged in three columns, we need to follow a systematic breakdown:\n\n### Structure of Targets\nThe targets are organized into three columns:\n- **Column A**: 3 targets (A1, A2, A3) \u2013 must be broken in the order A1 (bottom), A2, A3 (top).\n- **Column B**: 3 targets (B1, B2, B3) \u2013 must be broken in the order B1 (bottom), B2, B3 (top).\n- **Column C**: 2 targets (C1, C2) \u2013 must be broken in the order C1 (bottom), C2 (top).\n\n### Total Targets and Constraints\nIn total, there are 8 targets:\n- 3 targets from Column A\n- 3 targets from Column B\n- 2 targets from Column C\n\nGiven the requirement to break targets from the bottom to the top in each column, we can represent the targets as a sequence of letters:\n- 3 A's (representing A1, A2, A3)\n- 3 B's (representing B1, B2, B3)\n- 2 C's (representing C1, C2)\n\n### Valid Arrangements\nNow, the challenge simplifies to finding distinct arrangements of the sequence \"AAABBBCC\", which adheres to the breaking order constraints.\n\n### Using Permutations of a Multiset\nTo calculate the number of distinct arrangements of this multiset, we use the permutations formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Total permutations} = \\frac{n!}{n_1! \\times n_2! \\times n_3!}\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of targets (8),\n- \\( n_1 \\), \\( n_2 \\), and \\( n_3 \\) are the counts of each type of target (3 A's, 3 B's, 2 C's).\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get:\n\\[\n\\text{Total permutations} = \\frac{8!}{3! \\times 3! \\times 2!}\n\\]\n\n### Calculating Factorials\nNow we need to compute the factorials:\n- \\( 8! = 40320 \\)\n- \\( 3! = 6 \\)\n- \\( 2! = 2 \\)\n\n### Final Calculation\nSubstituting these factorial values into our formula gives:\n\\[\n\\text{Total permutations} = \\frac{40320}{6 \\times 6 \\times 2}\n\\]\nCalculating the denominator:\n\\[\n6 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 72\n\\]\nThus, we find:\n\\[\n\\text{Total permutations} = \\frac{40320}{72} = 560\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe total number of different orders in which the marksman can break the eight clay targets, while adhering to the established order, is:\n\n**560**",
  "ground_truth": "Suppose that the columns are labeled $A$, $B$, and $C$. Consider the string $AAABBBCC$. Since the arrangements of the strings is bijective to the order of shooting, the answer is the number of ways to arrange the letters which is $\\frac{8!}{3! \\cdot 3! \\cdot 2!} = \\boxed{560}$."
