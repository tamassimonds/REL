  "problem": "How many of the integers between 1 and 1000, inclusive, can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers?\n",
  "solution": "To find how many integers between 1 and 1000 can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers, we start with the identity:\n\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are nonnegative integers. Setting \\(n = a^2 - b^2\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nn = (a-b)(a+b) = xy\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(x = a-b\\) and \\(y = a+b\\). Both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) must be integers, with the condition that \\(y > x \\geq 0\\).\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1. Both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) must either be both odd or both even, resulting in \\(n\\) being odd or \\(n\\) of the form \\(4k\\) (an even integer).\n   - If \\(n\\) is odd, we can express it as \\(xy\\) with both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) odd.\n   - If \\(n\\) is even, specifically \\(n = 2k\\), \\(k\\) must be odd for \\(n\\) to be expressible as \\(xy\\).\n\nThus, the conditions for \\(n\\) to be expressed as a difference of squares are:\n- \\(n\\) is odd, or\n- \\(n\\) is of the form \\(4k\\).\n\n**Counting Valid Integers from 1 to 1000:**\n\n1. **Count of Odd Integers:**\n   - The odd integers from 1 to 1000 form the series: 1, 3, 5, ..., 999.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with:\n     - First term (\\(a\\)) = 1\n     - Last term (\\(l\\)) = 999\n     - Common difference (\\(d\\)) = 2.\n\n   To find the number of terms (\\(n\\)):\n   \\[\n   l = a + (n-1)d \\implies 999 = 1 + (n-1) \\cdot 2\n   \\]\n   Solving this gives:\n   \\[\n   998 = (n-1) \\cdot 2 \\implies n - 1 = 499 \\implies n = 500\n   \\]\n   Thus, there are 500 odd integers from 1 to 1000.\n\n2. **Count of Even Integers of the Form \\(4k\\):**\n   - The multiples of 4 from 1 to 1000 are: 4, 8, 12, ..., 1000.\n   - This series has:\n     - First term (\\(a\\)) = 4\n     - Last term (\\(l\\)) = 1000\n     - Common difference (\\(d\\)) = 4.\n\n   Calculating the number of terms (\\(n\\)):\n   \\[\n   l = a + (n-1)d \\implies 1000 = 4 + (n-1) \\cdot 4\n   \\]\n   Solving gives:\n   \\[\n   996 = (n-1) \\cdot 4 \\implies n - 1 = 249 \\implies n = 250\n   \\]\n   Therefore, there are 250 even integers of the form \\(4k\\) from 1 to 1000.\n\n**Total Count:**\nCombining both counts:\n- Odd integers: 500\n- Even integers of the form \\(4k\\): 250\n\nThe total number of integers between 1 and 1000 that can be expressed as the difference of squares of two nonnegative integers is:\n\n\\[\n500 + 250 = 750\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>750</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Notice that all odd numbers can be obtained by using $(a+1)^2-a^2=2a+1,$ where $a$ is a nonnegative integer. All multiples of $4$ can be obtained by using $(b+1)^2-(b-1)^2 = 4b$, where $b$ is a positive integer. Numbers congruent to $2 \\pmod 4$ cannot be obtained because squares are $0, 1 \\pmod 4.$ Thus, the answer is $500+250 = \\boxed{750}.$"
