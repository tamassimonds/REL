  "problem": "Five couples were at a party. If each person shook hands exactly once with everyone else except his/her spouse, how many handshakes were exchanged? (Note: One obviously doesn't shake hands with oneself.)",
  "solution": "To determine the total number of handshakes exchanged at the party, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total Number of People**: \n   There are 5 couples, so the total number of people at the party is:\n   \\[\n   5 \\text{ couples} \\times 2 \\text{ people per couple} = 10 \\text{ people}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculating Total Possible Handshakes**: \n   If every person shook hands with every other person, we would calculate the total number of handshakes using the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total handshakes} = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( n \\) is the total number of people (10):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45\n   \\]\n   So, without any restrictions, there would be 45 handshakes.\n\n3. **Applying the Restriction**: \n   Each person does not shake hands with their spouse. Given that there are 5 couples, this results in 5 handshakes that do not take place (one per couple).\n\n4. **Calculating Actual Handshakes**: \n   To find the actual number of handshakes exchanged, we subtract the number of handshakes that didn't occur from the total possible handshakes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Actual handshakes} = \\text{Total handshakes} - \\text{Handshakes not exchanged} = 45 - 5 = 40\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the total number of handshakes exchanged at the party is **40**.",
  "ground_truth": "There are a total of 10 people at the party.  Each shakes hands with everyone else, except for their spouse, which will be a total of $10-2=8$ other people.  The total number of handshakes will be $10\\cdot8/2=\\boxed{40}$, where we divide by 2 to correct for counting each handshake twice."
