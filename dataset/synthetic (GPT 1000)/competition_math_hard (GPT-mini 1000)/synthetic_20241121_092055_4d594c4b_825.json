  "problem": "Find the least odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$.\n",
  "solution": "To find the least odd prime factor of \\(2019^8 + 1\\), we can utilize properties from number theory and modular arithmetic. Below is a clear and coherent summary of the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Expression\nWe are interested in determining the least odd prime factor of \\(2019^8 + 1\\).\n\n### Step 2: Use Modular Arithmetic\nWe consider the expression \\(2019^8 + 1\\) under modulo \\(p\\) for various odd primes \\(p\\). If we find a prime \\(p\\) such that \\(2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}\\), we can draw conclusions about \\(p\\).\n\n### Step 3: Order and Fermat's Little Theorem\nIf \\(2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}\\), then squaring both sides gives us \\(2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\). This implies that the order of \\(2019\\) modulo \\(p\\) must divide \\(16\\).\n\n### Step 4: Possible Orders\nThe divisors of \\(16\\) are \\(1, 2, 4, 8,\\) and \\(16\\). If the order were \\(1, 2, 4,\\) or \\(8\\), this would lead to \\(2019^8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\), contradicting our requirement of \\(2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}\\). Thus, the order must be exactly \\(16\\).\n\n### Step 5: Relationship to \\(\\phi(p)\\)\nAccording to Fermat\u2019s theorem, since \\(16\\) divides \\(\\phi(p) = p - 1\\) for primes \\(p\\), we can conclude that \\(p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}\\).\n\n### Step 6: Identify Candidates\nThe smallest odd primes \\(p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}\\) are:\n- \\(17\\) (since \\(17 - 1 = 16\\))\n- Others like \\(33\\), \\(49\\), and \\(65\\) are not primes.\n- Next candidate is \\(97\\) (since \\(97 - 1 = 96\\)).\n\n### Step 7: Test \\(p = 17\\)\nNow we check if \\(17\\) is a factor:\n\n1. Calculate \\(2019 \\mod 17\\):\n   \\[\n   2019 \\div 17 \\approx 118 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2019 - 2006 = 13\n   \\]\n   So, \\(2019 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{17}\\).\n\n2. Calculate \\(2019^8 \\mod 17\\):\n   \\[\n   13^2 \\equiv 169 \\equiv 16 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   13^4 \\equiv (-1)^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 13^8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}.\n   \\]\n   This leads to a contradiction since \\(2019^8 \\equiv -1\\) is required.\n\n### Step 8: Test \\(p = 97\\)\nNext, we check \\(p = 97\\):\n\n1. Calculate \\(2019 \\mod 97\\):\n   \\[\n   2019 \\div 97 \\approx 20.83 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2019 - 1940 = 79\n   \\]\n   Hence, \\(2019 \\equiv 79 \\pmod{97}\\).\n\n2. Calculate \\(2019^8 \\mod 97\\):\n   We can compute powers, or use properties previously established. We find that ultimately:\n   \\[\n   79^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}.\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nSince \\(97\\) is the first prime we found that satisfies \\(2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}\\), we conclude that the least odd prime factor of \\(2019^8 + 1\\) is:\n\n**Answer: 97**",
  "ground_truth": "We know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. We want to find the smallest odd possible value of $p$. By squaring both sides of the congruence, we find $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.\nHowever, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8,$ then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1 \\pmod{p},$ which contradicts the given requirement that $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$.\nTherefore, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$. Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\\phi(p)$, we see that $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$. As $p$ is prime, $\\phi(p) = p\\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{p}\\right) = p - 1$. Therefore, $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. The two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \\pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$. As $2019^8 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$, the smallest possible $p$ is thus $\\boxed{97}$."
