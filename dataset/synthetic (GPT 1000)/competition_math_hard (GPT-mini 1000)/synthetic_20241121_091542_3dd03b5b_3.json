  "problem": "Given that the polynomial $x^2-5x+t$ has only positive integer roots, find the average of all distinct possible values of $t$.",
  "solution": "To determine the values of \\( t \\) such that the polynomial \\( x^2 - 5x + t \\) has only positive integer roots, we denote the roots as \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\). According to Vieta's formulas, we know:\n\n- The sum of the roots: \\( r_1 + r_2 = 5 \\)\n- The product of the roots: \\( r_1 r_2 = t \\)\n\nSince \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) are positive integers that sum to 5, we can identify the valid pairs of integers:\n\n1. \\( (1, 4) \\)\n2. \\( (2, 3) \\)\n\nThe pairs \\( (3, 2) \\) and \\( (4, 1) \\) are repetitions and do not yield new products.\n\nNext, we calculate the product \\( t \\) for each distinct pair of roots:\n\n- For the pair \\( (1, 4) \\): \n  \\[\n  t = 1 \\cdot 4 = 4\n  \\]\n\n- For the pair \\( (2, 3) \\):\n  \\[\n  t = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\n  \\]\n\nThe distinct values of \\( t \\) are \\( 4 \\) and \\( 6 \\).\n\nTo find the average of these values:\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{4 + 6}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this polynomial. Since $-\\frac{b}{a}$ is the sum and $\\frac{c}{a}$ is the product of the roots of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we have $r_1+r_2=5$ and $r_1r_2=t$. Since $r_1$ and $r_2$ are positive integers, the only possible ordered pairs $(r_1,r_2)$ are $(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),$ and $(4,1)$. These produce the values of 4,6,6, and 4 respectively for $t$. Therefore, the average of the distinct possibilities, 4 and 6, is $\\boxed{5}$."
