  "problem": "How many of the positive divisors of 3240 are multiples of 3?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of positive divisors of 3240 that are multiples of 3, we can follow these structured steps:\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 3240\nWe start with the prime factorization of 3240:\n\n1. **Divide by 10**:  \n   \\[\n   3240 = 324 \\times 10 = 324 \\times 2 \\times 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Factor 324**:  \n   Continuing the factorization:  \n   \\[\n   324 = 162 \\times 2  \n   162 = 81 \\times 2  \n   81 = 27 \\times 3  \n   27 = 9 \\times 3  \n   9 = 3 \\times 3  \n   \\]\n   Thus, \\(324\\) can be expressed as:  \n   \\[\n   324 = 2^2 \\times 3^4\n   \\]\n\nCombining everything, we have:  \n\\[\n3240 = 2^2 \\times 3^4 \\times 2^1 \\times 5^1 = 2^{3} \\times 3^{4} \\times 5^{1}\n\\]\n\nThe complete prime factorization of 3240 is:  \n\\[\n3240 = 2^3 \\times 3^4 \\times 5^1\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Divisors\nTo find the total number of divisors from the factorization \\(p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times ... \\times p_n^{e_n}\\), we use the formula:  \n\\[\n(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)...(e_n + 1)\n\\]\n\nFor our case, the exponents are \\(3\\), \\(4\\), and \\(1\\), giving us:  \n\\[\n(3 + 1)(4 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \\times 5 \\times 2 = 40\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Divisors That are Multiples of 3\nA divisor is a multiple of 3 if it includes at least one factor of 3. To find this, we will first calculate the number of divisors excluding any factors of 3.\n\nWe modify the factorization by considering \\(3^1\\):  \n\\[\n\\text{Remaining part} = 2^3 \\times 3^{3} \\times 5^1\n\\]\n\nNow calculating the number of divisors for \\(2^3 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^1\\):  \n\\[\n(3 + 1)(3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 32\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Count the Divisors that are Multiples of 3\nTo find the number of divisors of 3240 that are multiples of 3, we subtract the number of divisors without a factor of 3 from the total number of divisors:  \n\\[\n\\text{Count with 3} = \\text{Total Divisors} - \\text{Divisors without 3}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the calculation of divisors without 3 had an error. We need to use the divisors from \\(2^3 \\times 5^1\\) only:  \n\\[\n(3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \\times 2 = 8\n\\]\n\nNow we update the equation:  \n\\[\n\\text{Count with 3} = 40 - 8 = 32\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the number of positive divisors of 3240 that are multiples of 3 is:  \n\\[\n\\text{Final Count} = 32\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:  \n<ANSWER>32</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "$$ 3240 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^1 $$A positive divisor of 3240 is a multiple of 3 when it has a prime factorization in the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c$ where $0 \\le a \\le 3$, $1 \\le b \\le 4$, and $0 \\le c \\le 1$.  There are $4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{32}$ choices for $a$, $b$, and $c$, giving the number of positive divisors of 3240 that are multiples of 3."
