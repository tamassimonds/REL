  "problem": "The quadratic $3x^2+4x-9$ has two real roots. What is the sum of the squares of these roots? Express your answer as a common fraction in lowest terms.",
  "solution": "To find the sum of the squares of the roots of the quadratic equation \\(3x^2 + 4x - 9 = 0\\), we can use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of the equation to the roots.\n\nLet the roots be denoted as \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\). According to Vieta's formulas:\n\n1. The sum of the roots is given by:\n   \\[\n   r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{b}{a}\n   \\]\n2. The product of the roots is given by:\n   \\[\n   r_1 r_2 = \\frac{c}{a}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 1: Identify the coefficients\nFor the equation \\(3x^2 + 4x - 9 = 0\\):\n- \\(a = 3\\)\n- \\(b = 4\\)\n- \\(c = -9\\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the sum and product of the roots\nUsing Vieta's formulas:\n- The sum of the roots:\n  \\[\n  r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{4}{3}\n  \\]\n- The product of the roots:\n  \\[\n  r_1 r_2 = \\frac{-9}{3} = -3\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the squares of the roots\nThe sum of the squares of the roots can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nr_1^2 + r_2^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 2r_1 r_2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the previously calculated values:\n1. Calculate \\((r_1 + r_2)^2\\):\n   \\[\n   (r_1 + r_2)^2 = \\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{16}{9}\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\(2r_1 r_2\\):\n   \\[\n   2r_1 r_2 = 2 \\times (-3) = -6\n   \\]\n\nNow substituting these into the sum of the squares formula:\n\\[\nr_1^2 + r_2^2 = \\frac{16}{9} - (-6) = \\frac{16}{9} + 6\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Convert \\(6\\) to a fraction with a denominator of \\(9\\)\nTo facilitate addition:\n\\[\n6 = \\frac{54}{9}\n\\]\n\nNow add:\n\\[\nr_1^2 + r_2^2 = \\frac{16}{9} + \\frac{54}{9} = \\frac{70}{9}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the sum of the squares of the roots of the quadratic \\(3x^2 + 4x - 9\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{70}{9}\n\\]\n\nIn conclusion, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{The sum of the squares of the roots is } \\frac{70}{9}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of the equation $3x^2+4x-9$. We want to find $x_1^2+x_2^2$. Note that $x_1^2+x_2^2=(x_1+x_2)^2-2x_1x_2$. We know that $x_1+x_2$, the sum of the roots, is equal to $\\frac{-b}{a}$, which for this equation is $\\frac{-4}{3}$. Likewise, we know that $x_1x_2$, the product of the roots, is equal to $\\frac{c}{a}$, which for this equation is $\\frac{-9}{3}$. Thus, $x_1^2+x_2^2=\\left(\\frac{-4}{3}\\right)^2-2\\left(\\frac{-9}{3}\\right)=\\frac{16}{9}+\\frac{18}{3}=\\boxed{\\frac{70}{9}}$."
