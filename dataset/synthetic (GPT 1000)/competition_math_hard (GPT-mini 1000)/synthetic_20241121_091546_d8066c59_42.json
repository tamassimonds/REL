  "problem": "When the length of a rectangle is increased by $20\\%$ and the width increased by $10\\%$, by what percent is the area increased?",
  "solution": "To determine the percent increase in the area of a rectangle when its length is increased by 20% and its width by 10%, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Define Original Dimensions\nLet:\n- Original length = \\( L \\)\n- Original width = \\( W \\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Original Area\nThe original area \\( A \\) is calculated as:\n\\[\nA = L \\times W\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate New Dimensions\nAfter the increases, the new dimensions will be:\n- New length \\( L' = 1.2L \\) (20% increase)\n- New width \\( W' = 1.1W \\) (10% increase)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate New Area\nThe new area \\( A' \\) is:\n\\[\nA' = L' \\times W' = (1.2L) \\times (1.1W) = 1.32LW\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Increase in Area\nThe increase in area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Increase in Area} = A' - A = 1.32LW - LW = 0.32LW\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Percent Increase in Area\nTo find the percent increase, use the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Percent Increase} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Increase in Area}}{\\text{Original Area}}\\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n= \\left(\\frac{0.32LW}{LW}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 0.32 \\times 100\\% = 32\\%\n\\]\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe area of the rectangle increases by 32%.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>32% solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "If we let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$, then the original area of the rectangle is $lw$. The length is then increased $20\\%$ to $1.2l$ and the width is increased $10\\%$ to $1.1w$, so the new area is $(1.2l)(1.1w)=1.32lw$. There new area is $132\\%$ the old area, which represents a change of $\\boxed{32 \\%}$."
