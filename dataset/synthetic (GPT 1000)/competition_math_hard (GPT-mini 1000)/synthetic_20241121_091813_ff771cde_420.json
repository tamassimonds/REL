  "solution": "To determine the greatest integer value of \\( b \\) for which \\(-4\\) is not in the range of the quadratic function \\( y = x^2 + bx + 12 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Condition for \\(-4\\) Not Being in the Range**:\n   - We require the equation \\( x^2 + bx + 12 = -4 \\) to have no real solutions. This can be rewritten as:\n     \\[\n     x^2 + bx + 16 = 0\n     \\]\n   - This is a standard quadratic equation with \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = b \\), and \\( c = 16 \\).\n\n2. **Discriminant Calculation**:\n   - The discriminant \\( D \\) of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     D = b^2 - 4ac\n     \\]\n   - For our equation, substituting the values gives:\n     \\[\n     D = b^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 16 = b^2 - 64\n     \\]\n\n3. **Ensuring No Real Roots**:\n   - To ensure that the quadratic has no real roots, the discriminant must be less than zero:\n     \\[\n     b^2 - 64 < 0\n     \\]\n   - Rearranging leads to:\n     \\[\n     b^2 < 64\n     \\]\n\n4. **Finding the Range for \\( b \\)**:\n   - Taking the square root of both sides, we find:\n     \\[\n     |b| < 8\n     \\]\n   - This results in the inequalities:\n     \\[\n     -8 < b < 8\n     \\]\n\n5. **Identifying the Greatest Integer Value**:\n   - The greatest integer that satisfies the inequality \\( -8 < b < 8 \\) is \\( 7 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Thus, the greatest integer value of \\( b \\) such that \\(-4\\) is not in the range of \\( y = x^2 + bx + 12 \\) is:\n\\[\n\\text{The greatest integer value of } b \\text{ is } \\boxed{7}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "We see that $-4$ is not in the range of $f(x) = x^2 + bx + 12$ if and only if the equation $x^2 + bx + 12 = -4$ has no real roots.  We can re-write this equation as $x^2 + bx + 16 = 0$.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4 \\cdot 16 = b^2 - 64$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $b^2 - 64 < 0$, or $b^2 < 64$.  The greatest integer $b$ that satisfies this inequality is $b = \\boxed{7}$."
