  "problem": "The workers in a factory produce widgets and whoosits. For each product, production time is constant and identical for all workers, but not necessarily equal for the two products. In one hour, 100 workers can produce 300 widgets and 200 whoosits. In two hours, 60 workers can produce 240 widgets and 300 whoosits. In three hours, 50 workers can produce 150 widgets and $m$ whoosits. Find $m$.",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we start by defining the production times for widgets and whoosits with these variables:\n\n- \\( w \\) = time to produce one widget (in hours)\n- \\( h \\) = time to produce one whoosit (in hours)\n\n### Step 1: Scenario Analysis\n**Scenario 1:** 100 workers produce 300 widgets and 200 whoosits in one hour.\n\nThe total worker-hours available is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = 100 \\text{ workers} \\times 1 \\text{ hour} = 100 \\text{ worker-hours}\n\\]\n\nFrom this, we derive the equation:\n\n\\[\n300w + 200h = 100 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n**Scenario 2:** 60 workers produce 240 widgets and 300 whoosits in two hours.\n\nThe total worker-hours available is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = 60 \\text{ workers} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 120 \\text{ worker-hours}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us another equation:\n\n\\[\n240w + 300h = 120 \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Equations\nNow, we simplify both equations:\n\n- For Equation (1), divide by 100:\n\n\\[\n3w + 2h = 1 \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\n- For Equation (2), divide by 120:\n\n\\[\n2w + 2.5h = 1 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solving the Equations\nWe need to solve equations (3) and (4) simultaneously.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\n\\[\n2h = 1 - 3w \\implies h = \\frac{1 - 3w}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( h \\) into equation (4):\n\n\\[\n2w + 2.5\\left(\\frac{1 - 3w}{2}\\right) = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n2w + 1.25(1 - 3w) = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n2w + 1.25 - 3.75w = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n-1.75w + 1.25 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n-1.75w = -0.25 \\implies w = \\frac{1}{7}\n\\]\n\nNext, substituting \\( w \\) back into our expression for \\( h \\):\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{1 - 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7}}{2} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{3}{7}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{7}}{2} = \\frac{2}{7}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate \\( m \\) in the Third Scenario\nWith \\( w \\) and \\( h \\) known:\n\n- \\( w = \\frac{1}{7} \\) hours per widget\n- \\( h = \\frac{2}{7} \\) hours per whoosit\n\nIn the third scenario, 50 workers produce 150 widgets and \\( m \\) whoosits over three hours:\n\nThe total worker-hours available is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total time} = 50 \\text{ workers} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 150 \\text{ worker-hours}\n\\]\n\nWe set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n150w + mh = 150\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values of \\( w \\) and \\( h \\):\n\n\\[\n150 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} + m \\cdot \\frac{2}{7} = 150\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{150}{7} + \\frac{2m}{7} = 150\n\\]\n\nMultiplying through by 7 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n150 + 2m = 1050\n\\]\n\\[\n2m = 900 \\implies m = 450\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the value of \\( m \\) is \\( 450 \\):\n<ANSWER>450 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The fact that 60 workers produce 240 widgets and 300 whoosits in two hours implies that 100 workers produce 400 widgets and 500 whoosits in two hours, or 200 widgets and 250 whoosits in one hour. Let $a$ be the time required for a worker to produce a widget, and let $b$ be the time required for a worker to produce a whoosit. Then $300a + 200b = 200a + 250b$, which is equivalent to $b = 2a$. In three hours, 50 workers produce 300 widgets and 375 whoosits, so $150a + mb = 300a + 375b$ and $150a + 2ma = 300a + 750a$. Solving the last equation yields $m = \\boxed{450}$."
