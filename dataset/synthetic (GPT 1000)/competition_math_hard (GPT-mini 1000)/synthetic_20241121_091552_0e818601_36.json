  "problem": "A $33$-gon $P_1$ is drawn in the Cartesian plane.  The sum of the $x$-coordinates of the $33$ vertices equals $99$.  The midpoints of the sides of $P_1$ form a second $33$-gon, $P_2$.  Finally, the midpoints of the sides of $P_2$ form a third $33$-gon, $P_3$.  Find the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$.",
  "solution": "To find the sum of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the vertices of the polygon \\(P_3\\), we will track the transformations through each polygon step-by-step.\n\n1. **Sum for \\(P_1\\)**:\n   For the \\(33\\)-gon \\(P_1\\), we know the total sum of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of its vertices is:\n   \\[\n   S_1 = 99\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum for \\(P_2\\)**:\n   The vertices of polygon \\(P_2\\) are the midpoints of the sides of polygon \\(P_1\\). When computing these midpoints, the \\(x\\)-coordinate of each midpoint is the average of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the two endpoints of the corresponding side.\n\n   Let\u2019s denote the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the vertices of \\(P_1\\) as \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{33}\\). The sum of these coordinates is:\n   \\[\n   S_1 = x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_{33} = 99\n   \\]\n   The midpoints \\(M_i\\) of the sides can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   M_1 = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\quad M_2 = \\frac{x_2 + x_3}{2}, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad M_{33} = \\frac{x_{33} + x_1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n   To find the total \\(x\\)-coordinate sum for \\(P_2\\), we compute:\n   \\[\n   S_2 = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} + \\frac{x_2 + x_3}{2} + \\cdots + \\frac{x_{33} + x_1}{2}\n   \\]\n   Rearranging, we note that each \\(x_i\\) contributes to two midpoints:\n   \\[\n   S_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (x_1 + x_2) + (x_2 + x_3) + \\cdots + (x_{33} + x_1) \\right)\n   \\]\n   This expression simplifies as both ends of the vertex sequence wrap around:\n   \\[\n   S_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2(x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_{33}) \\right) = x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_{33} = S_1 = 99\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum for \\(P_3\\)**:\n   Now applying the same principle to find \\(S_3\\), the sum of the \\(x\\)-coordinates for polygon \\(P_3\\), we observe that \\(P_3\\) is formed by taking the midpoints of the sides of \\(P_2\\). Using the same reasoning as before, the total \\(x\\)-coordinate sum for \\(P_3\\) is:\n   \\[\n   S_3 = S_2 = 99\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the vertices of \\(P_3\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{99}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_1$ be $x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_{33}$.  Then, by the midpoint formula, the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_2$ are $\\frac{x_1+x_2}2,\\frac{x_2+x_3}2,\\ldots,\\frac{x_{33}+x_1}2 $.  The sum of these equals $\\frac{2x_1+2x_2+\\cdots +2x_{33}}2=x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_{33}$.  Similarly, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$ equals the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of  $P_2$.  Thus the desired answer is $\\boxed{99}$."
