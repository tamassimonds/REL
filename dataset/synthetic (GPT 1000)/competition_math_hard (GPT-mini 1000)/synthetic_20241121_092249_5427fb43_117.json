  "problem": "The energy stored by any pair of positive charges is inversely proportional to the distance between them, and directly proportional to their charges. Three identical point charges start at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, and this configuration stores 15 Joules of energy. How much more energy, in Joules, would be stored if one of these charges was moved to the midpoint of the opposite side?",
  "solution": "To determine how much additional energy is stored when one of the point charges is moved to the midpoint of the opposite side of an equilateral triangle formed by three identical point charges, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Initial Configuration\n\nLet each point charge be \\( q \\), and the distance between the charges (the side length of the equilateral triangle) be \\( a \\). The energy stored between two point charges is calculated using:\n\n\\[\nU = k \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( U \\) is potential energy, \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant, \\( q_1 \\) and \\( q_2 \\) are the charges, and \\( r \\) is the distance between them. \n\nIn the initial configuration with three charges at the vertices of the triangle, we have three pairs of charges contributing to the total potential energy:\n\n- \\( U_{AB} = k \\frac{q^2}{a} \\)\n- \\( U_{BC} = k \\frac{q^2}{a} \\)\n- \\( U_{CA} = k \\frac{q^2}{a} \\)\n\nThus, the total initial energy is:\n\n\\[\nU_{\\text{initial}} = 3 \\cdot k \\frac{q^2}{a} = k \\frac{3q^2}{a}\n\\]\n\nWe know that \\( U_{\\text{initial}} = 15 \\) Joules. Therefore:\n\n\\[\nk \\frac{3q^2}{a} = 15 \\text{ Joules}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: New Configuration\n\nNext, we move charge \\( A \\) to the midpoint of side \\( BC \\). In this new configuration, the distances are:\n\n- \\( AB = \\frac{a}{2} \\)\n- \\( AC = \\frac{a}{2} \\)\n- \\( BC = a \\)\n\nNow calculating the potential energy in the new configuration gives:\n\n\\[\nU_{\\text{new}} = U_{AB} + U_{AC} + U_{BC}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1. \\( U_{AB} = k \\frac{q^2}{\\frac{a}{2}} = k \\frac{2q^2}{a} \\)\n2. \\( U_{AC} = k \\frac{q^2}{\\frac{a}{2}} = k \\frac{2q^2}{a} \\)\n3. \\( U_{BC} = k \\frac{q^2}{a} \\)\n\nSumming these energies, we have:\n\n\\[\nU_{\\text{new}} = k \\frac{2q^2}{a} + k \\frac{2q^2}{a} + k \\frac{q^2}{a} = k \\frac{5q^2}{a}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Increase in Energy\n\nTo find the increase in energy, we calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta U = U_{\\text{new}} - U_{\\text{initial}} = k \\frac{5q^2}{a} - k \\frac{3q^2}{a} = k \\frac{2q^2}{a}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Relate New Energy to Known Energy\n\nFrom our earlier equation \\( k \\frac{3q^2}{a} = 15 \\text{ Joules} \\), we can find \\( k \\frac{2q^2}{a} \\):\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{kq^2}{a} = \\frac{15}{3} = 5 \\text{ Joules}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nk \\frac{2q^2}{a} = 2 \\cdot 5 = 10 \\text{ Joules}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the additional energy stored when one of the charges is moved to the midpoint of the opposite side is:\n\n\\[\n10 \\text{ Joules}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let the side length of the equilateral triangle be $d$. $15/3=5$ Joules of energy are stored when two charges are at distance $d$, so $2\\cdot5=10$ Joules are stored when they are at distance $d/2$, because energy is inversely proportional to distance. This means that in the second configuration, the pair $(A,C)$ and $(B,C)$ store 10 Joules each, and since $(A,B)$ still stores 5 Joules, the final configuration stores a total of $10+10+5=25$ Joules, which is $25-15=\\boxed{10}$ Joules more than the initial configuration.
