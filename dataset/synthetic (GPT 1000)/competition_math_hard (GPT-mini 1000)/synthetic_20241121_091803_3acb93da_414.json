  "problem": "A spiral staircase turns $270^\\circ$ as it rises 10 feet.  The radius of the staircase is 3 feet.  What is the number of feet in the length of the handrail?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
  "solution": "To determine the length of the handrail on a spiral staircase, we can model the handrail as a helical curve. The handrail rises 10 feet while winding around the staircase\u2019s center axis through an angle of \\(270^\\circ\\) (or \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of a complete turn). This helix can be analyzed in three dimensions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Identify Given Parameters:**\n   - Vertical rise (\\( h \\)) = 10 feet\n   - Angle of turn = \\(270^\\circ\\)\n   - Radius of the helix (\\( r \\)) = 3 feet\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Turns:**\n   Given that a full turn is \\(360^\\circ\\):\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{270^\\circ}{360^\\circ} = \\frac{3}{4}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Horizontal Distance:**\n   The circumference of a full turn at the radius is:\n   \\[\n   C = 2 \\pi r = 2 \\pi \\times 3 = 6\\pi \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   For \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of a turn, the horizontal distance traveled is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Horizontal Distance} = \\frac{3}{4} C = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 6\\pi = \\frac{9\\pi}{2} \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Use the Helix Length Formula:**\n   The length \\( L \\) of the helix is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   L = \\sqrt{(2 \\pi r \\cdot n)^2 + h^2}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in our values:\n   \\[\n   L = \\sqrt{(2 \\pi \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\frac{3}{4})^2 + 10^2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate Each Component:**\n   - First compute \\( 2 \\pi \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} \\):\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{9\\pi}{2}\n   \\]\n   - Then square it:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{9\\pi}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{81\\pi^2}{4}\n   \\]\n   - Compute \\( h^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   10^2 = 100\n   \\]\n\n6. **Combine the Results:**\n   Plugging these into the formula gives:\n   \\[\n   L = \\sqrt{\\frac{81\\pi^2}{4} + 100}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Evaluate Using \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14159 \\):**\n   Estimate \\( 81\\pi^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   81\\pi^2 \\approx 81 \\cdot (3.14159^2) \\approx 81 \\cdot 9.8696 \\approx 800\n   \\]\n   Hence,\n   \\[\n   \\frac{81\\pi^2}{4} \\approx 200\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   L = \\sqrt{200 + 100} = \\sqrt{300}\n   \\]\n\n8. **Final Calculation of Length:**\n   Evaluating \\( \\sqrt{300} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{300} \\approx 17.32\n   \\]\n   Rounding to the nearest tenth, we find:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of handrail} = 17.3\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe length of the handrail on the spiral staircase is approximately \\(\\text{17.3 feet}\\). \n\n<ANSWER>17.3</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The handrail encases a right circular cylinder with radius 3 feet and height 10 feet.  Its lateral area is a rectangle with height 10 feet and width equal to its base circumference, or $2\\pi\\cdot 3 = 6\\pi$ feet.  A staircase that turns $360^\\circ$ would, when unrolled and lain flat, span the diagonal of this rectangle.  However, our staircase does not make a full turn, so it spans a rectangle with a shorter width.\n\nA $270^\\circ$ sector of a circle with radius 3 has arc length $\\frac{270^\\circ}{360^\\circ}\\cdot 2\\pi\\cdot 3 = 4.5\\pi$.  Thus, when unrolled and lain flat, our handrail spans the diagonal of a rectangle with height 10 feet and width $4.5\\pi$ feet.  Our handrail has length $\\sqrt{10^2+(4.5\\pi)^2} \\approx 17.317$ feet.  To the nearest tenth, this value is $\\boxed{17.3}$ feet."
