  "problem": "Simplify $\\dfrac{5+12i}{2-3i}$. Your answer should be of the form $a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are both real numbers and written as improper fractions (if necessary).",
  "solution": "To simplify the expression \\(\\dfrac{5+12i}{2-3i}\\), we aim to eliminate the imaginary unit \\(i\\) from the denominator. This can be accomplished by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.\n\n1. **Identify the Conjugate:**  \n   The conjugate of \\(2-3i\\) is \\(2+3i\\).\n\n2. **Multiply by the Conjugate:**  \n   We multiply the expression by \\(\\dfrac{2+3i}{2+3i}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dfrac{5+12i}{2-3i} \\cdot \\dfrac{2+3i}{2+3i} = \\dfrac{(5+12i)(2+3i)}{(2-3i)(2+3i)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Denominator:**  \n   Using the formula \\(a^2 - b^2\\) for the product of conjugates:\n   \\[\n   (2-3i)(2+3i) = 2^2 - (3i)^2 = 4 - 9(-1) = 4 + 9 = 13\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Numerator:**  \n   Distributing in the numerator:\n   \\[\n   (5+12i)(2+3i) = 5 \\cdot 2 + 5 \\cdot 3i + 12i \\cdot 2 + 12i \\cdot 3i = 10 + 15i + 24i + 36(-1)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   10 + 15i + 24i - 36 = -26 + 39i\n   \\]\n\n5. **Combine the Results:**  \n   Now, substituting back into the expression:\n   \\[\n   \\dfrac{-26 + 39i}{13}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplify Further:**  \n   Finally, we divide both the real and imaginary parts by 13:\n   \\[\n   = \\dfrac{-26}{13} + \\dfrac{39i}{13} = -2 + 3i\n   \\]\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-2 + 3i\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n<ANSWER>-2 + 3i</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\dfrac{5+12i}{2-3i} \\cdot \\frac{2+3i}{2+3i} &= \\frac{5(2) + 5(3i) + 12i(2) +12i(3i)}{2(2) + 2(3i) + -3i(2) -3i(3i)}\\\\\n& = \\frac{-26+39i}{13} \\\\\n&= \\boxed{-2+3i}.\n\\end{align*}"
