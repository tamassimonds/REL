  "problem": "A rectangular cow pasture is enclosed on three sides by a fence and the fourth side is part of the side of a barn that is $400$ feet long. The fence costs $\\$5$ per foot, and $\\$1,\\!200$ altogether. To the nearest foot, find the length of the side parallel to the barn that will maximize the area of the pasture.",
  "solution": "To maximize the area of a rectangular cow pasture that has one side along a barn, we can follow a systematic approach:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Variables\nLet:\n- \\( x \\): length of the side parallel to the barn,\n- \\( y \\): length of the two sides perpendicular to the barn.\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Cost Constraint\nThe total cost for fencing is \\$1,200, with a cost of \\$5 per foot. The fencing needed for the three sides (one side is along the barn) is:\n\\[\nx + 2y\n\\]\nThus, the cost equation becomes:\n\\[\n5(x + 2y) = 1200\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 5 gives:\n\\[\nx + 2y = 240\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Express \\( y \\) in Terms of \\( x \\)\nRearranging the equation:\n\\[\n2y = 240 - x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = \\frac{240 - x}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Set Up the Area Function\nThe area \\( A \\) of the pasture can be expressed as:\n\\[\nA = x \\cdot y\n\\]\nSubstituting for \\( y \\):\n\\[\nA = x \\cdot \\frac{240 - x}{2} = \\frac{240x - x^2}{2}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nA = 120x - \\frac{1}{2}x^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Find the Maximum Area\nTo find the maximum area, take the derivative of \\( A \\) with respect to \\( x \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dA}{dx} = 120 - x\n\\]\nSetting the derivative to zero for critical points:\n\\[\n120 - x = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 120\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Confirm Maximum Area\nTo ensure that this critical point is indeed a maximum, we evaluate the second derivative:\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2A}{dx^2} = -1\n\\]\nSince the second derivative is negative, the function is concave down, confirming \\( x = 120 \\) is a maximum.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe length of the side of the cow pasture parallel to the barn that maximizes the area is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{120} \\text{ feet}\n\\] \n\nThus, the solution concludes with an optimal length of 120 feet for the pasture side adjacent to the barn.",
  "ground_truth": "Let the sides perpendicular to the barn be of length $x$. Notice that there are a total of $1200/5=240$ feet of fencing. Therefore, the side parallel to the barn has length $240-2x$, so the area to be maximized is $240x-2x^2$. Completing the square results in $-2(x-60)^2+7200$, which is maximized when $x=60$. Therefore, the side parallel to the barn has length $240-2(60)=\\boxed{120}$ feet."
