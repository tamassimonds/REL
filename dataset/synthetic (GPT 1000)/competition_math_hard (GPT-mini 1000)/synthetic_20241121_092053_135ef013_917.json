  "problem": "A merchant offers a large group of items at $30\\%$ off.  Later, the merchant takes $20\\%$ off these sale prices and claims that the final price of these items is $50\\%$ off the original price.  As a percentage of the original price, what is the difference between the true discount and the merchant's claimed discount? (Your answer should be a positive difference.)",
  "solution": "To determine the difference between the merchant's claimed discount and the true discount on an item, follow these steps starting with the original price \\( P \\).\n\n1. **Apply the first discount of 30%**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sale Price after 30% off} = P - 0.3P = 0.7P\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the second discount of 20% on the new sale price**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Price after additional 20% off} = 0.7P - 0.2(0.7P) = 0.7P - 0.14P = 0.56P\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the true discount from the original price**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{True Discount} = P - 0.56P = 0.44P\n   \\]\n\n4. **Express the true discount as a percentage of the original price**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{True Discount Percentage} = \\frac{0.44P}{P} \\times 100\\% = 44\\%\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compare with the merchant's claimed discount of 50%**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Claimed Discount Percentage} = 50\\%\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the difference between the claimed discount and the true discount**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 50\\% - 44\\% = 6\\%\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the difference between the true discount of 44% and the merchant's claimed discount of 50% is \\( \\boxed{6} \\).",
  "ground_truth": "The first discount means that the customer will pay $70\\%$ of the original price.  The second discount means a selling price of $80\\%$ of  the discounted price.  Because $0.80(0.70) = 0.56 = 56\\% $, the customer pays $56\\%$ of the original price and thus receives a $44\\%$ discount, for a difference of $50\\% - 44\\% = \\boxed{6\\%}$."
