  "problem": "What is the sum of all integer solutions to $|n| < |n-3| < 9$?",
  "solution": "To solve the inequality \\( |n| < |n-3| < 9 \\), we will break it down into two parts: \\( |n| < |n-3| \\) and \\( |n-3| < 9 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Solve \\( |n-3| < 9 \\)\n\nThe inequality \\( |n-3| < 9 \\) indicates that the distance of \\( n \\) from 3 is less than 9. We can rewrite this as:\n\\[\n-9 < n - 3 < 9\n\\]\nAdding 3 to each part gives:\n\\[\n-6 < n < 12\n\\]\nThus, \\( n \\) must be an integer in the interval \\( (-6, 12) \\).\n\n### Step 2: Solve \\( |n| < |n-3| \\)\n\nNow we address the second inequality \\( |n| < |n-3| \\) by considering different cases.\n\n- **Case 1**: \\( n \\geq 3 \\)\n\nHere, \\( |n| = n \\) and \\( |n-3| = n - 3 \\). This leads to:\n\\[\nn < n - 3\n\\]\nThis inequality is not feasible, so there are no solutions for \\( n \\geq 3 \\).\n\n- **Case 2**: \\( n < 3 \\)\n\nWe further analyze this case, dividing it into subcases based on the sign of \\( n \\).\n\n- **Subcase 2.1**: \\( 0 \\leq n < 3 \\)\n\nIn this range, \\( |n| = n \\) and \\( |n-3| = 3 - n \\). The inequality becomes:\n\\[\nn < 3 - n\n\\]\nSolving it yields:\n\\[\n2n < 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n < \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\nThus, valid integer solutions in this subcase are \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\).\n\n- **Subcase 2.2**: \\( n < 0 \\)\n\nHere, we have \\( |n| = -n \\) and \\( |n-3| = 3 - n \\). The inequality becomes:\n\\[\n-n < 3 - n\n\\]\nSimplifying, we obtain:\n\\[\n0 < 3\n\\]\nThis is always true. Consequently, any integer \\( n < 0 \\) that lies within the interval \\( (-6, 12) \\) is valid. The solutions are \\( -5, -4, -3, -2, -1 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Compile the integer solutions\n\nFrom both cases, the integer solutions are:\n- From Subcase 2.1: \\( 0, 1 \\)\n- From Subcase 2.2: \\( -5, -4, -3, -2, -1 \\)\n\nThus, the complete set of integer solutions is:\n\\[\n-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the sum of all integer solutions\n\nCalculating the sum of these solutions:\n\\[\n-5 + (-4) + (-3) + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1 = -5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 + 1 = -14\n\\]\n\nFinally, we conclude:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of all integer solutions} = -14\n\\]\n\nThe answer is:\n<ANSWER>-14 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "First let's solve $|n-3|<9$.  The absolute value of a quantity is less than 9 if and only if the quantity is between $-9$ and 9, so solve \\[\n\\begin{array}{r@{\\;\\;<\\;\\;}c@{\\;\\;<\\;\\;}lc}\n-9 & n-3 & 9 &\\quad \\implies \\\\\n-9+3 & n & 9+3 &\\quad \\implies \\\\\n-6 & n & 12.\n\\end{array}\n\\] Now consider $|n|<|n-3|$.  The distance from $n$ to 0 is $|n|$, and the distance from $n$ to 3 is $|n-3|$.  Therefore, this inequality is satisfied by the numbers that are closer to 0 than to 3.  These are the numbers less than $1.5$.  So the integer solutions of $|n|<|n-3|<9$ are $-5$, $-4$, $-3$, $-2$, $-1$, 0, and 1, and their sum is $-5-4-3-2=\\boxed{-14}$."
