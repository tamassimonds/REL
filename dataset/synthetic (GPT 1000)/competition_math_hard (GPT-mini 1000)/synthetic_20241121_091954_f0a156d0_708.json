  "solution": "To find the minimum value of \\( y \\) in the equation \\( x^2 + y^2 = 14x + 48y \\), we will rearrange the equation and complete the square.\n\n1. **Rearranging the Equation:**\n   We start by moving all terms to one side:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 14x + y^2 - 48y = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Completing the Square for \\( x \\):**\n   For the terms involving \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 14x\n   \\]\n   To complete the square, we take half of \\(-14\\), which is \\(-7\\), and square it to get \\(49\\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 14x = (x - 7)^2 - 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Completing the Square for \\( y \\):**\n   Now for the terms involving \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   y^2 - 48y\n   \\]\n   Taking half of \\(-48\\) gives \\(-24\\), and squaring it yields \\(576\\):\n   \\[\n   y^2 - 48y = (y - 24)^2 - 576\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substituting Back:**\n   Substituting these completed squares into our rearranged equation results in:\n   \\[\n   (x - 7)^2 - 49 + (y - 24)^2 - 576 = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we have:\n   \\[\n   (x - 7)^2 + (y - 24)^2 - 625 = 0\n   \\]\n   This can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   (x - 7)^2 + (y - 24)^2 = 625\n   \\]\n\n5. **Geometric Interpretation:**\n   This equation represents a circle with center at \\( (7, 24) \\) and radius \\( 25 \\) (since \\( \\sqrt{625} = 25 \\)).\n\n6. **Finding the Minimum \\( y \\):**\n   To find the minimum value of \\( y \\), we look at the lowest point of the circle.

  "ground_truth": "Moving all the terms to the LHS, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides. We have the equation  \\[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \\Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\\]Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\\pm \\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$. Since $\\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a negative sign in front of the square root. Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(x-7)^2$. Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$. At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=-\\sqrt{625}+24=-1$. Thus, the minimum $y$ value is $\\boxed{-1}$.\n\n--OR--\n\nSimilar to the solution above, we can complete the square to get the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$. This equation describes a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $\\sqrt{625}=25$. The minimum value of $y$ is achieved at the point on the bottom of the circle, which is located at $(7,24-25)=(7,-1)$. Thus, the minimum value of $y$ is $\\boxed{-1}$."
