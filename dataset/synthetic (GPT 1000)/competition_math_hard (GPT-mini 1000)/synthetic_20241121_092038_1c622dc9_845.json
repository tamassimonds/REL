  "problem": "A standard six-sided die is rolled, and  $P$ is the product of the five numbers that are visible. What is the largest number that is certain to divide $P$?",
  "solution": "To determine the largest number that is guaranteed to divide the product \\( P \\) of the five visible numbers on a standard six-sided die, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Die**: A standard six-sided die has numbers 1 through 6 on its faces. When rolled, one number will face down, while the other five are visible.\n\n2. **Calculating the Total Product**: The product of all six numbers on the die is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 720\n   \\]\n\n3. **Identifying Possible Products**: The value of \\( P \\), which is the product of the five visible faces, is determined by dividing the total product by the number on the face that is facing down. Thus, depending on which face is down, we find:\n   - If 1 is down: \\( P = \\frac{720}{1} = 720 \\)\n   - If 2 is down: \\( P = \\frac{720}{2} = 360 \\)\n   - If 3 is down: \\( P = \\frac{720}{3} = 240 \\)\n   - If 4 is down: \\( P = \\frac{720}{4} = 180 \\)\n   - If 5 is down: \\( P = \\frac{720}{5} = 144 \\)\n   - If 6 is down: \\( P = \\frac{720}{6} = 120 \\)\n\n   Therefore, the possible values of \\( P \\) are: 720, 360, 240, 180, 144, and 120.\n\n4. **Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: We now need to find the largest number that divides all these possible values of \\( P \\). To do this, we\u2019ll perform prime factorization for each number:\n   - \\( 720 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\)\n   - \\( 360 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\)\n   - \\( 240 = 2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\)\n   - \\( 180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\)\n   - \\( 144 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\)\n   - \\( 120 = 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\)\n\n   We then find the GCD by taking the minimum exponent of each prime factor from the factorizations:\n   - For \\( 2 \\): The minimum exponent is \\( 2 \\) (from \\( 180 \\)).\n   - For \\( 3 \\): The minimum exponent is \\( 1 \\) (from \\( 240 \\) and \\( 120 \\)).\n   - For \\( 5 \\): The minimum exponent is \\( 0 \\) (since \\( 144 \\) does not include \\( 5 \\)).\n\n   Therefore, the GCD is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   2^2 \\times 3^1 = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The largest number that is certain to divide \\( P \\), regardless of which face is facing down, is \\( 12 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<12> solution</12>",
  "ground_truth": "Since $6! = 720 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, the prime factors of $P$ can consist of at most 2's, 3's, and 5's.  The least possible number of 2's is two, which occurs when 4 is not visible. The least possible number of 3's is one, which occurs when either 3 or 6 is not visible, and the least number of 5's is zero, when 5 is not visible.  Thus $P$ must be divisible by $2^2\\cdot3 =\n\\boxed{12}$, but not necessarily by any larger number."
