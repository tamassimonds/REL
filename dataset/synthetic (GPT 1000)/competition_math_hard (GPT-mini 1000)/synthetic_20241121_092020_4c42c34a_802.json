  "problem": "Chewbacca has 20 pieces of cherry gum and 30 pieces of grape gum.  Some of the pieces are in complete packs, while others are loose.  Each complete pack has exactly $x$ pieces of gum. If Chewbacca loses one pack of cherry gum, then the ratio of the number of pieces of cherry gum he has to the number of pieces of grape gum will be exactly the same as if he instead finds 5 packs of grape gum.  Find $x$.",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we define \\( x \\) as the number of pieces in each complete pack of gum.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Changes in Gum Pieces\n1. **Cherry Gum**: If Chewbacca loses one pack of cherry gum, he will have:\n   \\[\n   20 - x \\text{ pieces of cherry gum.}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Grape Gum**: Initially, he has 30 pieces of grape gum, which remains unchanged until he finds 5 packs:\n   \\[\n   30 + 5x \\text{ pieces of grape gum.}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Ratios\nWe need to set up the ratio of cherry to grape gum after both events:\n1. **After losing one pack of cherry gum**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{20 - x}{30}\n   \\]\n\n2. **After finding 5 packs of grape gum**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{20}{30 + 5x}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Set the Ratios Equal\nSince the cherry-to-grape ratio remains the same throughout the events, we can set the two ratios equal to one another:\n\\[\n\\frac{20 - x}{30} = \\frac{20}{30 + 5x}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Cross-Multiply\nCross-multiplying eliminates the fractions:\n\\[\n(20 - x)(30 + 5x) = 20 \\times 30\n\\]\nCalculating the right-hand side gives:\n\\[\n20 \\times 30 = 600,\n\\]\nresulting in the equation:\n\\[\n(20 - x)(30 + 5x) = 600.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Expand the Left-Hand Side\nNow, we expand the left-hand side:\n\\[\n600 + 100x - 30x - 5x^2 = 600.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Simplify\nNext, we simplify by subtracting 600 from both sides:\n\\[\n100x - 30x - 5x^2 = 0,\n\\]\nwhich reduces to:\n\\[\n70x - 5x^2 = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Factor the Quadratic\nWe factor out \\( 5x \\):\n\\[\n5x(14 - x) = 0.\n\\]\nSetting each factor to zero results in:\n\\[\n5x = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 14 - x = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis yields the potential solutions:\n\\[\nx = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 14.\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Choose the Valid Solution\nGiven that \\( x = 0 \\) would imply there are no packs, which contradicts the problem context, we discard it. Therefore, the only valid solution is:\n\\[\nx = 14.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of pieces in each complete pack of gum is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "If Chewbacca loses one pack of cherry gum, the ratio of the number of pieces of cherry gum he has to the number of pieces of grape gum is $(20-x)/30$. If he instead finds 5 packs of grape gum, this ratio will be $20/(30+5x)$. These ratios must be equal, so we must have  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{20-x}{30} &= \\frac{20}{30+5x} \\quad\\implies\\\\\n(20-x)(30+5x)& = (30)(20) \\quad\\implies\\\\\n(20-x)(5)(6+x) &= (30)(20).\\end{align*}Dividing both sides by 5 gives $$(20-x)(6+x) = (30)(4)$$and expanding the left side of this gives $$120+14x -x^2 = 120.$$Therefore, $x^2-14x=0$, so $x(x-14)=0$.  We can't have $x=0$, so we must have $x=\\boxed{14}$."
