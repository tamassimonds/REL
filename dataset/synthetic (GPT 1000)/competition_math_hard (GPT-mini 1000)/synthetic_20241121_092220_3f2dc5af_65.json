  "problem": "One of Euler's conjectures was disproved in the 1960s by three American mathematicians when they showed there was a positive integer such that $133^5+110^5+84^5+27^5=n^{5}$. Find the value of $n$.\n",
  "solution": "To solve for \\( n \\) in the equation \\( 133^5 + 110^5 + 84^5 + 27^5 = n^5 \\), we follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Each Fifth Power**\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 133^5 \\):**\n   \\[\n   133^5 = 433494437\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate \\( 110^5 \\):**\n   \\[\n   110^5 = 161051000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\( 84^5 \\):**\n   \\[\n   84^5 = 4182119424\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate \\( 27^5 \\):**\n   \\[\n   27^5 = 14348907\n   \\]\n\n**Step 2: Sum the Fifth Powers**\n\nWe now add these computed fifth powers together:\n\n\\[\n133^5 + 110^5 + 84^5 + 27^5 = 433494437 + 161051000 + 4182119424 + 14348907\n\\]\n\nCalculating the sum step-by-step:\n\n1.

  "ground_truth": "Note that $n$ is even, since the $LHS$ consists of two odd and two even numbers. By Fermat's Little Theorem, we know ${n^{5}}$ is congruent to $n$ modulo 5. Hence,\n$3 + 0 + 4 + 2 \\equiv n\\pmod{5}$\n$4 \\equiv n\\pmod{5}$\nContinuing, we examine the equation modulo 3,\n$1 - 1 + 0 + 0 \\equiv n\\pmod{3}$\n$0 \\equiv n\\pmod{3}$\nThus, $n$ is divisible by three and leaves a remainder of four when divided by 5. It's obvious that $n>133$, so the only possibilities are $n = 144$ or $n \\geq 174$. It quickly becomes apparent that 174 is much too large, so $n$ must be $\\boxed{144}$."
