  "problem": "Determine the sum of all prime numbers $p$ for which there exists no integer solution in $x$ to the congruence $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p$.",
  "solution": "To find the sum of all prime numbers \\( p \\) such that there is no integer solution \\( x \\) to the congruence \n\n\\[\n3(6x+1) \\equiv 4 \\pmod{p},\n\\]\n\nwe begin by simplifying this equation.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Congruence\nFirst, we rewrite the original equation:\n\n\\[\n3(6x + 1) \\equiv 4 \\pmod{p}.\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n18x + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{p}.\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 3 \\) from both sides gives us:\n\n\\[\n18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Conditions for Solution Existence\nThe equation \\( 18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\) has a solution if \\( 18 \\) has a multiplicative inverse modulo \\( p \\). This inverse exists if and only if \\( \\gcd(18, p) = 1 \\), meaning \\( 18 \\) and \\( p \\) are coprime.\n\n### Step 3: Finding Relevant Primes\nNext, we look for values of \\( p \\) where \\( \\gcd(18, p) \\neq 1 \\). The prime factorization of \\( 18 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n18 = 2 \\times 3^2.\n\\]\n\nThus, the prime factors of \\( 18 \\) are \\( 2 \\) and \\( 3 \\). If \\( p \\) is either of these primes, \\( 18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} \\) will not have a solution.\n\n### Step 4: Summing Up\nThe only primes \\( p \\) that divide \\( 18 \\) are \\( 2 \\) and \\( 3 \\). Therefore, the sum of all such primes is:\n\n\\[\n2 + 3 = 5.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nConsequently, the sum of all prime numbers \\( p \\) for which there exists no integer solution \\( x \\) to the given congruence is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}.\n\\]\n\nTo present the final answer succinctly:\n\n<ANSWER>5 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Firstly, the congruence can be simplified to $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p\\implies 18x\\equiv 1\\pmod p$. This is solvable for $x$ if and only if $18$ is invertible modulo $p$, meaning $\\gcd(18,p)=1$. Since the prime factors of $18$ are $2,3$, these are precisely the prime moduli for which an $x$ cannot exist since then $\\gcd(18,p)>1$. Thus, the desired number is $2+3=\\boxed{5}$."
