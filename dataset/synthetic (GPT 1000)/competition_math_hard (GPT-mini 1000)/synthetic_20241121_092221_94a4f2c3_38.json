  "problem": "What is the range of the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$?",
  "solution": "To determine the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\), we must analyze its behavior over its domain.\n\n1. **Identify the Domain**:  \n   The function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is defined for all \\( x \\) except where the denominator is zero. Therefore, the domain is:\n   \\[\n   x \\in (-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\infty)\n   \\]\n   This indicates that \\( x \\) can be any real number except \\( x = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Behavior Near Zero**:  \n   - As \\( x \\) approaches \\( 0 \\) from the left (\\( x \\to 0^- \\)), \\( f(x) \\) approaches \\( +\\infty \\).\n   - As \\( x \\) approaches \\( 0 \\) from the right (\\( x \\to 0^+ \\)), \\( f(x) \\) also approaches \\( +\\infty \\).\n\n3. **Behavior as x Increases/Decreases**:  \n   - As \\( x \\) approaches \\( +\\infty \\) or \\( -\\infty \\), \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) approaches \\( 0 \\) from above, getting closer but never reaching \\( 0 \\).\n\n4. **Evaluation of Specific Values**:  \n   - For \\( x = 1 \\), \\( f(1) = 1 \\).\n   - For \\( x = -1 \\), \\( f(-1) = 1 \\).\n   - For \\( x = 2 \\), \\( f(2) = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n   - For \\( x = -2 \\), \\( f(-2) = \\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion About Output Values**:  \n   Since \\( f(x) \\) produces positive values and can take any value from \\( 0 \\) to \\( +\\infty \\), the range of the function excludes \\( 0 \\). Hence, the outputs can be any positive real number.\n\nConsequently, the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\) is:\n\\[\n(0, +\\infty)\n\\]\n\nFinal answer:  \n<ANSWER> (0, +\\infty) solution </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Note that $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} >0$ for all nonzero $x$. That is, the range of $f$ must only include positive numbers. Conversely, if $a$ is a positive number, then \\[f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\right)=\\frac{1}{(1/\\sqrt{a})^2} = a,\\]so $a$ is indeed in the range of $f$. Thus, the range of $f$ is the set of all positive real numbers; in interval notation, that's $\\boxed{(0,\\infty)}$."
