  "problem": "Anton has two species of ants, Species A and Species B, in his ant farm. The two species are identical in appearance, but Anton knows that every day, there are twice as many ants of Species A than before, while there are three times as many ants of Species B. On Day 0, Anton counts that there are 30 ants in his ant farm. On Day 5, Anton counts that there are 3281 ants in his ant farm. How many of these are of Species A?",
  "solution": "To determine the initial number of ants of Species A at Day 0, we can set up a system of equations based on their growth rates and total counts.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( a_0 \\) be the initial number of ants of Species A on Day 0.\n   - Let \\( b_0 \\) be the initial number of ants of Species B on Day 0.\n   \n   From the problem, we know:\n   \\[\n   a_0 + b_0 = 30 \\tag{1}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Growth Rates:**\n   - Species A doubles each day, so on Day \\( d \\) its population is \\( a_0 \\times 2^d \\).\n   - Species B triples each day, making its population on Day \\( d \\) equal to \\( b_0 \\times 3^d \\).\n\n3. **Count on Day 5:**\n   We know that on Day 5, the total number of ants is 3281:\n   \\[\n   a_0 \\times 2^5 + b_0 \\times 3^5 = 3281 \\tag{2}\n   \\]\n   Using the values \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 3^5 = 243 \\), we rewrite equation (2):\n   \\[\n   32a_0 + 243b_0 = 3281 \\tag{3}\n   \\]\n\n4. **System of Equations:**\n   We have:\n   - Equation (1): \\( a_0 + b_0 = 30 \\)\n   - Equation (3): \\( 32a_0 + 243b_0 = 3281 \\)\n\n   From equation (1), we can express \\( b_0 \\) as:\n   \\[\n   b_0 = 30 - a_0 \\tag{4}\n   \\]\n\n   Substituting equation (4) into equation (3) gives:\n   \\[\n   32a_0 + 243(30 - a_0) = 3281\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we have:\n   \\[\n   32a_0 + 7290 - 243a_0 = 3281\n   \\]\n   Combining like terms results in:\n   \\[\n   -211a_0 + 7290 = 3281\n   \\]\n   Rearranging yields:\n   \\[\n   -211a_0 = 3281 - 7290\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -211a_0 = -4009\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   a_0 = \\frac{4009}{211} \\approx 19\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate \\( b_0 \\):**\n   Using equation (4):\n   \\[\n   b_0 = 30 - a_0 = 30 - 19 = 11\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verification on Day 5:**\n   We can verify the counts on Day 5:\n   - For Species A:\n   \\[\n   19 \\times 2^5 = 19 \\times 32 = 608\n   \\]\n   - For Species B:\n   \\[\n   11 \\times 3^5 = 11 \\times 243 = 2673\n   \\]\n   Checking the total:\n   \\[\n   608 + 2673 = 3281\n   \\]\n   The totals match the given information, confirming our calculations.\n\n**Final answer:**\nThe number of ants of Species A is **19**.",
  "ground_truth": "Suppose that there are $a$ ants of Species A and $b$ ants of Species B on Day 0. We thus have that $a+b=30$. Notice that on Day 1, there will be $2a$ ants of Species A, on Day 2, there will be $2(2a) = 4a$ ants of Species A, and on Day 3, there will be $2(4a)=8a$ ants of Species A, etc. Following this line of reasoning, on Day 5, there will be $2^5a$ ants of Species A and $3^5b$ ants of Species B, meaning that $32a+243b=3281$. We now solve this system of linear equations. We have that $32a+32b=960$, so \\begin{align*}(32a+243b)-(32a+32b) &= 211b \\\\\n&= 3281-960 \\\\\n&= 2321.\\end{align*}We then have $b = \\frac{2321}{211} = 11$. This means that $a=30-11=19$, and there are $32\\cdot 19 = \\boxed{608}$ ants of Species A on Day 5."
