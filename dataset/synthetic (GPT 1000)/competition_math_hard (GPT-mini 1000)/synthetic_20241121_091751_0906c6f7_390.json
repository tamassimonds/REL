  "problem": "The difference between two perfect squares is 133.  What is the smallest possible sum of the two perfect squares?",
  "solution": "To determine the smallest possible sum of two perfect squares whose difference is 133, we start by letting \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) represent the perfect squares, where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers such that \\(a^2 - b^2 = 133\\).\n\n1. **Factoring the Difference of Squares:**\n   We can factor the equation \\(a^2 - b^2\\) using the difference of squares formula:\n   \\[\n   a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\n   \\]\n   This leads us to the equation:\n   \\[\n   (a - b)(a + b) = 133\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identifying Factor Pairs of 133:**\n   The factor pairs of 133 are:\n   - \\(1\\) and \\(133\\)\n   - \\(7\\) and \\(19\\)\n\n3. **Solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) Using Each Factor Pair:**\n\n   - **For the factor pair \\( (1, 133) \\):**\n     - We set \\(a - b = 1\\) and \\(a + b = 133\\). \n     - Adding these equations gives:\n       \\[\n       2a = 134 \\implies a = 67\n       \\]\n     - Subtracting the first from the second gives:\n       \\[\n       2b = 132 \\implies b = 66\n       \\]\n\n   - **For the factor pair \\( (7, 19) \\):**\n     - We set \\(a - b = 7\\) and \\(a + b = 19\\).\n     - Adding these equations results in:\n       \\[\n       2a = 26 \\implies a = 13\n       \\]\n     - Subtracting the first from the second gives:\n       \\[\n       2b = 12 \\implies b = 6\n       \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Sums of Their Squares:**\n   Now we calculate the sums of the squares for both sets of values:\n\n   - For \\(a = 67\\) and \\(b = 66\\):\n     \\[\n     a^2 + b^2 = 67^2 + 66^2 = 4489 + 4356 = 8845\n     \\]\n   - For \\(a = 13\\) and \\(b = 6\\):\n     \\[\n     a^2 + b^2 = 13^2 + 6^2 = 169 + 36 = 205\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determining the Smallest Sum:**\n   Comparing the two sums calculated:\n   \\[\n   8845 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 205\n   \\]\n   The smallest sum of the two perfect squares is \\(205\\).\n\nThus, the smallest possible sum of the two perfect squares is:\n\n<ANSWER> 205 </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We are given that $x^2 - y^2 = 133$, which is the same as $(x+y)(x-y) = 133$. $133$ has two pairs of factors: 1 and 133, and 7 and 19. So, either $x+y = 133$ and $x-y = 1$, or $x+y = 19$ and $x-y = 7$. It is clear that $x$ and $y$ will be much larger in the first case, because they must sum to 133, so, because we are trying to minimize $x^2 + y^2$, we can simply consider the second case. Through simple algebra, we find that $x = 13$ and $y = 6$. Thus, $x^2 + y^2$ is minimized as $169 + 36 = \\boxed{205}$."
