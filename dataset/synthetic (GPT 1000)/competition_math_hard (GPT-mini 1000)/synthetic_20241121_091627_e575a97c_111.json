  "solution": "To find a permutation \\((a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots, a_{12})\\) of the numbers \\(1\\) to \\(12\\) that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. \\(a_1 > a_2 > a_3 > a_4 > a_5 > a_6\\)\n2. \\(a_6 < a_7 < a_8 < a_9 < a_{10} < a_{11} < a_{12}\\)\n\nwe proceed with the solution as follows:\n\n### Solution Steps\n\n1. **Set \\(a_6\\)**:\n   - Since \\(a_6\\) is the smallest among the first six numbers, we assign \\(a_6 = 1\\). This ensures that all other numbers in positions \\(a_1\\) through \\(a_5\\) will be greater than \\(1\\).\n\n2. **Select Remaining Numbers**:\n   - We now need to select \\(5\\) additional numbers from the set \\(\\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\}\\). This leaves us with \\(11\\) potential candidates.\n\n3. **Choosing 5 Numbers**:\n   - The number of ways to choose \\(5\\) numbers from these \\(11\\) can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{11}{5}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate \\(\\binom{11}{5}\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{11}{5} = \\frac{11!}{5! \\times (11-5)!} = \\frac{11!}{5! \\times 6!} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{55440}{120} = 462\n   \\]\n\n5. **Arrange Selected Numbers**:\n   - The \\(5\\) chosen numbers will occupy positions \\(a_1\\) to \\(a_5\\) and must be arranged in strictly decreasing order, which can only be done in one specific way. \n   - The \\(6\\) remaining numbers will fill positions \\(a_7\\) to \\(a_{12}\\) and must be arranged in strictly increasing order, again yielding only one valid arrangement.\n\n6. **Final Count**:\n   - Since each selection of \\(5\\) numbers results in one valid ordering, the total number of valid permutations is simply:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total valid permutations} = \\binom{11}{5} = 462\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER> 462 solution </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Clearly, $a_6=1$. Now, consider selecting $5$ of the remaining $11$ values. Sort these values in descending order, and sort the other $6$ values in ascending order. Now, let the $5$ selected values be $a_1$ through $a_5$, and let the remaining $6$ be $a_7$ through ${a_{12}}$. It is now clear that there is a bijection between the number of ways to select $5$ values from $11$ and ordered 12-tuples $(a_1,\\ldots,a_{12})$. Thus, there will be ${11 \\choose 5}=\\boxed{462}$ such ordered 12-tuples."
