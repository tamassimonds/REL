  "problem": "The coefficients of the polynomial\n\\[x^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0\\]are all integers.  Let $n$ be the exact number of integer roots of the polynomial, counting multiplicity.  For example, the polynomial $(x + 3)^2 (x^2 + 4x + 11) = 0$ has two integer roots counting multiplicity, because the root $-3$ is counted twice.\n\nEnter all possible values of $n,$ separated by commas.",
  "solution": "To determine the possible values of \\( n \\), the number of integer roots (counting multiplicity) of the polynomial \n\n\\[\nx^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0,\n\\]\n\nwe analyze the following:\n\n1. **Degree and Roots**: A fourth-degree polynomial can have a maximum of 4 roots, considering both real and complex roots. Here, we focus on integer roots.\n\n2. **Counting Integer Roots**:\n   - **\\( n = 0 \\)**: The polynomial may have no integer roots. An example is \\( x^4 + 1 = 0 \\).\n   - **\\( n = 1 \\)**: There may be one integer root, with the other three roots being non-integer. For instance, \\( x(x^3 + 2) = 0 \\) has one integer root (0) and three non-integer roots.\n   - **\\( n = 2 \\)**: This occurs when there are two integer roots. For example, the polynomial \\( x^2(x^2 + 1) = 0 \\) has two integer roots (both 0) and two non-integer roots.\n   - **\\( n = 3 \\)**: For three integer roots, there would be only one root left. However, if three roots are integers, by Vieta's formulas, the fourth root must also be an integer (since the sum of all roots is an integer). Therefore, \\( n \\) cannot be 3.\n   - **\\( n = 4 \\)**: This case occurs when all four roots are integers. An example is \\( (x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3)(x - r_4) = 0 \\) with \\( r_i \\) as integers.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the possible values of \\( n \\) are:\n\n\\[\nn = 0, 1, 2, 4\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the possible values of \\( n \\) are:\n\n<ANSWER>0, 1, 2, 4</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The polynomial $x^4 + 1 = 0$ shows that $n$ can be 0\n\nThe polynomial $x(x^3 + 2)$ shows that $n$ can be 1.\n\nThe polynomial $x^2 (x^2 + 1)$ shows that $n$ can be 2.\n\nThe polynomial $x^4$ shows that $n$ can be 4.\n\nSuppose the polynomial has three integer roots.  By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $-b,$ which is an integer.  Therefore, the fourth root is also an integer, so it is impossible to have exactly three integer roots.\n\nThus, the possible values of $n$ are $\\boxed{0, 1, 2, 4}.$"
