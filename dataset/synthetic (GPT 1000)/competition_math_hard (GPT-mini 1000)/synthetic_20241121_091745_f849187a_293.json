  "solution": "To determine the total number of different automobile license plate combinations given specific constraints, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Selecting the Letters\n\n1. **Choose the Repeated Letter**: We have 26 letters in the English alphabet and can select one letter to be repeated. This gives us 26 choices.\n  \n2. **Choose 2 Distinct Letters**: After selecting the repeated letter, we choose 2 additional distinct letters from the remaining 25 letters. The number of ways to choose 2 letters from 25 is calculated using the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{25}{2} = \\frac{25 \\times 24}{2} = 300\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Letter Combinations**: As a result, the total number of ways to select the letters is:\n   \\[\n   26 \\times 300 = 7800\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Arranging the Letters\n\nWith our four letters (one repeated and two distinct), we need to calculate the arrangements. The formula for permutations of a multiset is:\n\\[\n\\text{Arrangements} = \\frac{n!}{n_1! \\cdot n_2! \\cdot n_3!}\n\\]\nWhere:\n- \\( n = 4 \\) (total letters),\n- \\( n_1 = 2 \\) (count of the repeated letter),\n- \\( n_2 = 1 \\) (count of the first distinct letter),\n- \\( n_3 = 1 \\) (count of the second distinct letter).\n\nCalculating the total arrangements gives:\n\\[\n\\text{Arrangements} = \\frac{4!}{2! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1!} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Choosing and Arranging the Digits\n\nThe license plate includes two digits from 0-9, where digits cannot repeat:\n\n1. **First Digit**: Choose any of the 10 digits (0-9).\n2. **Second Digit**: After the first digit is chosen, 9 choices remain.\n\nThus, the total combinations for the digits is:\n\\[\n10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Total Combinations\n\nNow, we combine the calculations for the letters and digits:\n\n1. Multiply the number of ways to select and arrange the letters by the digit combinations. Initially:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Combinations} = (7800 \\text{ ways to choose letters}) \\times (90 \\text{ ways to choose digits}) = 7800 \\times 90 = 702000\n   \\]\n\n### Adjusting for Arrangement of Letters\n\nWe also need to correct our counting of arrangements by considering the positioning of the repeated letters:\n\n1. **Choosing Positions for the Repeated Letter**: From the 4 available positions, select 2 for the repeated letter:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Arranging Remaining Letters**: The two distinct letters can be arranged in the remaining positions in \\(2!\\) ways:\n   \\[\n   2! = 2\n   \\]\n\nThus, we should adjust our total arrangements as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Arrangements} = 7800 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 93600\n\\]\n\n### Final Calculation Including Digits\n\nFinally, including the digit combinations, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{Final Total} = 93600 \\times 90 = 8424000\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe total number of different automobile license plate combinations possible is:\n<ANSWER>8424000</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "There are 26 ways to choose the repeated letter, $\\binom{25}{2}$ ways to choose the other two letters, $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose in which two of the four positions to put the repeated letters, 2 ways to choose how to arrange the remaining two letters, 10 ways to choose the first digit and 9 ways to choose the second digit for a total of $(26)\\binom{25}{2}\\binom{4}{2}(2)(10)(9)=\\boxed{8,\\!424,\\!000}$ combinations."
