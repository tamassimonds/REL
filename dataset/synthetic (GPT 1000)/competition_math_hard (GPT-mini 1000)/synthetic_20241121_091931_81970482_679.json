  "problem": "What is the measure of the smaller angle between the hands of a 12-hour clock at 12:25 pm, in degrees? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
  "solution": "To determine the smaller angle between the hands of a 12-hour clock at 12:25 pm, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the position of the minute hand\nThe minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes. Thus, its position at 25 minutes is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Minute hand position} = \\left(\\frac{360 \\text{ degrees}}{60 \\text{ minutes}}\\right) \\times 25 = 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the position of the hour hand\nThe hour hand completes a full circle (360 degrees) in 12 hours. Therefore, its position at 12:25 is calculated using both the hour and the minutes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hour hand position} = \\left(\\frac{360 \\text{ degrees}}{12 \\text{ hours}}\\right) \\times 0 + \\left(\\frac{360 \\text{ degrees}}{12 \\times 60}\\right) \\times 25\n\\]\n\nSince it's 12:25, we consider the hour as 0 (equivalent to 12 on a 12-hour clock):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Hour hand position} = 0 + \\left(\\frac{360}{720}\\right) \\times 25 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 25 = 12.5 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the angle between the hour and minute hands\nNext, we calculate the difference between the positions of the minute hand and the hour hand:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle between hands} = |\\text{Minute hand position} - \\text{Hour hand position}| = |150 - 12.5| = 137.5 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the smaller angle\nTo find the smaller angle between the hands, we compare the calculated angle with its supplementary angle (360 degrees minus the angle):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Smaller angle} = \\min(137.5, 360 - 137.5) = \\min(137.5, 222.5) = 137.5 \\text{ degrees}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the measure of the smaller angle between the hands of the clock at 12:25 pm is:\n\n**137.5 degrees**",
  "ground_truth": "Every minute, the minute hand moves $360 \\div 60 = 6$ degrees. At 25 minutes past the hour, the minute hand is $25 \\times 6 = 150$ degrees past the vertical 12:00 position. Every minute, the hour hand moves $360 \\div 12 \\div 60 = 0.5$ degrees. At 25 minutes past 12:00, the hour hand is $25 \\times 0.5 = 12.5$ degrees past the vertical 12:00 position. The angle between the hands of the clock at 12:25 is $150 - 12.5 = \\boxed{137.5\\text{ degrees}}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2.5 cm);\n\nint i;\n\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1));\n\nfor (i = 0; i <= 11; ++i) {\n  draw(0.9*dir(30*i)--dir(30*i));\n  label(\"$\" + string(i + 1) + \"$\", 1.15*dir(90 - 30*i - 30));\n}\n\ndraw((0,0)--0.8*dir(300));\ndraw((0,0)--0.6*dir(90 - 12/25*30));\n[/asy]"
