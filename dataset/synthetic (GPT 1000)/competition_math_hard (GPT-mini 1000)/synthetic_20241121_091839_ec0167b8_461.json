  "problem": "Consider the set of 30 parabolas defined as follows: all parabolas have as focus the point $(0,0)$ and the directrix lines have the form $y=ax+b$ with $a$ and $b$ integers such that $a\\in \\{-2,-1,0,1,2\\}$ and $b\\in \\{-3,-2,-1,1,2,3\\}$. No three of these parabolas have a common point. How many points in the plane are on two of these parabolas?",
  "solution": "To determine how many points in the plane lie on two of the 30 parabolas defined by a common focus at \\((0, 0)\\) and different directrices, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Count the Number of Parabolas\n\nEach parabola is characterized by a fixed focus \\((0, 0)\\) and a directrix of the form \\(y = ax + b\\). The parameters are:\n- The slope \\(a\\) can take values from the set \\(\\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}\\), representing 5 options.\n- The intercept \\(b\\) can take values from the set \\(\\{-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3\\}\\), representing 6 options.\n\nThus, the total number of parabolas is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 6 = 30.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Intersection of Parabolas\n\nTo find intersection points between two parabolas, we look for points \\((x, y)\\) that satisfy both parabola equations, indicating that the distances from \\((0, 0)\\) to the focus and the directrices are equal.\n\n### Step 3: Selecting Pairs of Parabolas\n\nWe can choose pairs of parabolas from the 30 available using the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{30}{2} = \\frac{30 \\times 29}{2} = 435.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Identifying Non-Intersecting Pairs\n\nNot all pairs intersect. Specifically, pairs with directrices that share the same slope \\(a\\) and have \\(b\\) values such that the lines do not straddle the focus will not intersect. Given the slopes:\n- For each \\(a\\) value (5 total), we can select \\(b\\) values from either the negative set \\(\\{-3, -2, -1\\}\\) or the positive set \\(\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\).\n\nFor each slope \\(a\\):\n- The negative \\(b\\) values yield \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) non-intersecting pairs.\n- The positive \\(b\\) values yield another \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) non-intersecting pairs.\n\nThus, each slope \\(a\\) contributes \\(3 + 3 = 6\\) non-intersecting pairs. Across the 5 slopes, the total number of non-intersecting pairs is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 6 = 30.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculating Intersecting Pairs\n\nThe number of intersecting pairs of parabolas is then found by subtracting the non-intersecting pairs from the total pairs:\n\\[\n\\text{Total intersecting pairs} = \\binom{30}{2} - \\text{non-intersecting pairs} = 435 - 30 = 405.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Total Intersection Points\n\nEach intersecting pair of parabolas intersects at exactly 2 points. Therefore, the total number of unique intersection points is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 405 = 810.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe total number of points in the plane that lie on two of these parabolas is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{810}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "If two parabolas have the same focus, and their directrices intersect, then the parabolas intersect in exactly two points.\n\nSuppose two parabolas have the same focus and their directrices are parallel.  If the focus lies between the two directrices, then the parabolas again intersect in exactly two points.  However, if the focus does not between the two directrices, then the parabolas do not intersect.\n\nThere are $\\binom{30}{2}$ ways to choose a pair of parabolas.  In terms of $a$ and $b,$ the parabolas do not intersect when their slopes $a$ are the same, and their $b$-values have the same sign (because this is when the focus does not lie between the two directrices).  There are five ways to choose the value of $a,$ and $\\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{3}{2} = 6$ ways to choose the values of $b$ (either both are negative or both are positive).  Hence, the total number of intersection points is\n\\[2 \\left( \\binom{30}{2} - 5 \\cdot 6 \\right) = \\boxed{810}.\\]"
