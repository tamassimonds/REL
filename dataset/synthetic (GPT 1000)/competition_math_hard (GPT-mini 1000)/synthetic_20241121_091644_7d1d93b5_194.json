  "problem": "When a certain biased coin is flipped five times, the probability of getting heads exactly once is not equal to $0$ and is the same as that of getting heads exactly twice. Let $\\frac ij$, in lowest terms, be the probability that the coin comes up heads in exactly $3$ out of $5$ flips. Find $i+j$.\n",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of finding the probability of a biased coin coming up heads exactly three times in five flips, given that the probability of getting heads exactly once is equal to that of getting heads exactly twice, we proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Define the Probability**: Let \\( p \\) represent the probability of getting heads in a single flip. Consequently, the probability of tails will be \\( 1 - p \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Probability of Heads Exactly Once**: Using the binomial probability formula, the probability of getting heads exactly once in five flips is given by:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{1 head}) = \\binom{5}{1} p^1 (1-p)^{4} = 5p(1-p)^{4}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Probability of Heads Exactly Twice**: Similarly, the probability of getting heads exactly twice is:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{2 heads}) = \\binom{5}{2} p^2 (1-p)^{3} = 10p^2(1-p)^{3}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set the Probabilities Equal**: According to the problem, these two probabilities are equal:\n   \\[\n   5p(1-p)^4 = 10p^2(1-p)^3\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Equation**: We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\( p \\) (valid since \\( p \\neq 0 \\)) and then by \\( (1-p)^3 \\) (valid since \\( 1-p \\neq 0 \\)):\n   \\[\n   5(1-p) = 10p\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve for \\( p \\)**:\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   5 = 15p \\implies p = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate the Probability of Getting Exactly 3 Heads**: With \\( p \\) determined, we can now calculate the probability of getting exactly 3 heads:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{3 heads}) = \\binom{5}{3} p^3 (1-p)^{2}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( p = \\frac{1}{3} \\):\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{3 heads}) = 10 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^{2} = 10 \\cdot \\frac{1}{27} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9}\n   \\]\n   Calculate the result:\n   \\[\n   = 10 \\cdot \\frac{4}{243} = \\frac{40}{243}\n   \\]\n\n8. **Final Calculation**: The probability \\( \\frac{40}{243} \\) is in lowest terms. Thus, if we denote \\( i = 40 \\) and \\( j = 243 \\), we find:\n   \\[\n   i + j = 40 + 243 = 283\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is \n\\[\n\\boxed{283}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Denote the probability of getting a heads in one flip of the biased coin as $h$. Based upon the problem, note that ${5\\choose1}(h)^1(1-h)^4 = {5\\choose2}(h)^2(1-h)^3$. After canceling out terms, we get $1 - h = 2h$, so $h = \\frac{1}{3}$. The answer we are looking for is ${5\\choose3}(h)^3(1-h)^2 = 10\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{40}{243}$, so $i+j=40+243=\\boxed{283}$."
