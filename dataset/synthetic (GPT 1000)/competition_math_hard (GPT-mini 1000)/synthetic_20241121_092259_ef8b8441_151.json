  "problem": "How many ways can change be made for a quarter using standard U.S. coins?  (Don't count \"1 quarter\" as making change for a quarter.)",
  "solution": "To find the total number of ways to make change for a quarter (25 cents) using standard U.S. coins (pennies, nickels, and dimes), we will enumerate all combinations that add up to 25 cents, while excluding the option of using a single quarter.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n\n1. **Coin Types**: We can use:\n   - **Pennies** (1 cent)\n   - **Nickels** (5 cents)\n   - **Dimes** (10 cents)\n\n2. **Equation Setup**: We need to find combinations of these coins that total 25 cents:\n   \\[\n   p + 5n + 10d = 25\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\(p\\) = number of pennies,\n   - \\(n\\) = number of nickels,\n   - \\(d\\) = number of dimes.\n\n3. **Analyzing Dime Combinations**: We will evaluate different counts of dimes and calculate the corresponding values of nickels and pennies required to reach 25 cents.\n\n#### Case 1: 0 Dimes\n\\[\np + 5n = 25\n\\]\n- Possible values for \\(n\\):\n  - \\(n = 0\\): \\(p = 25\\)\n  - \\(n = 1\\): \\(p = 20\\)\n  - \\(n = 2\\): \\(p = 15\\)\n  - \\(n = 3\\): \\(p = 10\\)\n  - \\(n = 4\\): \\(p = 5\\)\n  - \\(n = 5\\): \\(p = 0\\)\n\nTotal combinations = **6**\n\n#### Case 2: 1 Dime\n\\[\np + 5n = 15\n\\]\n- Possible values for \\(n\\):\n  - \\(n = 0\\): \\(p = 15\\)\n  - \\(n = 1\\): \\(p = 10\\)\n  - \\(n = 2\\): \\(p = 5\\)\n  - \\(n = 3\\): \\(p = 0\\)\n\nTotal combinations = **4**\n\n#### Case 3: 2 Dimes\n\\[\np + 5n = 5\n\\]\n- Possible values for \\(n\\):\n  - \\(n = 0\\): \\(p = 5\\)\n  - \\(n = 1\\): \\(p = 0\\)\n\nTotal combinations = **2**\n\n#### Case 4: 3 Dimes\n\\[\np + 5n = -5\n\\]\n- This case is not applicable, as the total cannot be negative.\n\n### Total Combinations:\n- Case 1: 6 combinations\n- Case 2: 4 combinations\n- Case 3: 2 combinations\n- Case 4: 0 combinations\n\nAdding together the combinations from all applicable cases:\n\\[\n6 + 4 + 2 = 12\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to make change for a quarter using standard U.S. coins (excluding the option of using 1 quarter) is:\n\n**12**",
  "ground_truth": "Let's break the $25$ cents down into five $5$-cent blocks. One nickel or five pennies are the two ways we can fill a $5$-cent block. One dime fills two $5$-cent blocks. Now we consider the possible cases based on how many dimes we use.\n\n$\\emph{Two dimes:}$ Let's say we have two dimes, which fill up four out of the five $5$-cent blocks. We only have to fill one more block, and there are two ways to do that (with a nickel or with pennies). This case yields $\\emph{2}$ possible ways.\n\n$\\emph{One dime:}$ If we use one dime, we fill up two out of the five blocks. Now we have to use nickels and/or pennies to fill up the remaining three blocks. The ways we can do that are to use no nickels, one nickel, two nickels, or three nickels and make up the rest of the amount with pennies. This case yields $\\emph{4}$ possible ways.\n\n$\\emph{No dimes:}$ If we use no dimes, we have to use nickels and/or pennies to fill up five blocks. We can use $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \\text{ or } 5$ nickels and make up the rest of the amount with pennies. This case yields $\\emph{6}$ possible ways.\n\nSo the total number of ways is $2+4+6=\\boxed{12}$ ways."
