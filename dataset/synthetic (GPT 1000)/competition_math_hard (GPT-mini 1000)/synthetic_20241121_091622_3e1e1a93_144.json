  "problem": "A fair coin is flipped $7$ times. What is the probability that at least $5$ consecutive flips come up heads?",
  "solution": "To find the probability of getting at least 5 consecutive heads in 7 flips of a fair coin, we can follow a structured approach:\n\n### Step 1: Total Outcomes\nA fair coin has two possible outcomes (heads or tails) for each flip. Thus, for 7 flips, the total number of outcomes is:\n\\[\n2^7 = 128\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting Outcomes with At Least 5 Consecutive Heads\nNext, we count the number of outcomes containing at least one occurrence of 5 or more consecutive heads. We break this down into three cases based on the number of consecutive heads.\n\n#### Case 1: Exactly 5 Consecutive Heads\nThe sequence \"HHHHH\" can start at three positions:\n- **Position 1:** \"HHHHHT_\" (2 options for the last flip)\n- **Position 2:** \"_HHHHHT\" (2 options for the first flip)\n- **Position 3:** \"__HHHHH\" (1 option for the first two flips)\n\nCalculating outcomes:\n- From position 1: 2 outcomes\n- From position 2: 2 outcomes\n- From position 3: 1 outcome\n\nTotal for 5 consecutive heads:\n\\[\n2 + 2 + 1 = 5 \\text{ outcomes}\n\\]\n\n#### Case 2: Exactly 6 Consecutive Heads\nThe sequence \"HHHHHH\" can start in two positions:\n- **Position 1:** \"HHHHHHT\" (1 option for the last bit)\n- **Position 2:** \"THHHHHH\" (1 option for the first bit)\n\nTotal for 6 consecutive heads:\n\\[\n1 + 1 = 2 \\text{ outcomes}\n\\]\n\n#### Case 3: Exactly 7 Consecutive Heads\nThere is only one sequence:\n- \"HHHHHHH\" (1 outcome)\n\n### Step 3: Total Outcomes with At Least 5 Heads\nNow, we combine the counts from all cases:\n\\[\n\\text{At least 5 consecutive heads} = 5 \\text{ (from case 5)} + 2 \\text{ (from case 6)} + 1 \\text{ (from case 7)} = 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Probability\nThe probability of getting at least 5 consecutive heads in 7 flips is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes:\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least 5 consecutive heads}) = \\frac{8}{128} = \\frac{1}{16}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the probability that at least 5 consecutive flips come up heads is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "First, we count the number of total outcomes. Each toss has $2$ possibilities - heads or tails - so the $7$ tosses have $2^7 = 128$ possible outcomes.\n\nTo count the number of outcomes with at least $5$ consecutive heads, we need to use casework.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 1: Exactly $5$ heads. There are three positions for a string of $5$ heads in a row, so there are $3$ possibilities in this case.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 2: Exactly $6$ heads in a row. There are two positions for a string of $6$ heads in a row, so there are $2$ possibilities in this case.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 3: Exactly $6$ heads, but not six in a row. There are two possibilities: either the first five coins and the last coin are heads, or the last five coins and the first coin are heads.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 4: $7$ heads. There's only $1$ way to do this -- all $7$ tosses must be heads.\n\nSo there are $3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8$ successful outcomes, hence the probability is $\\frac{8}{128}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}.$"
