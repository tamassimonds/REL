  "problem": "Two cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that both cards are numbers (2 through 10) totaling to 12?",
  "solution": "To determine the probability that two randomly selected cards from a standard 52-card deck are numbered cards (ranging from 2 to 10) that sum to 12, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Numbered Cards\nThe numbered cards in a standard deck consist of the following ranks: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. This results in a total of 9 ranks.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Combinations that Total 12\nNext, we look for pairs of these numbered cards that sum up to 12. The valid pairs are:\n1. (2, 10)\n2. (3, 9)\n3. (4, 8)\n4. (5, 7)\n5. (6, 6) \n\n### Step 3: Count the Combinations for Each Pair\nFor each identified pair, we calculate how many distinct ways we can draw the cards considering the four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades):\n- For the pair (2, 10), we have 4 twos and 4 tens, leading to \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\) combinations.\n- For the pair (3, 9), this again results in \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\) combinations.\n- For the pair (4, 8), we also get \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\) combinations.\n- For the pair (5, 7), there are \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\) combinations.\n- For the pair (6, 6), since we need to choose 2 out of 4 sixes, we use the combinations formula \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which results in 6 combinations.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Total Favorable Outcomes\nNow we sum the combinations for all the pairs calculated:\n- (2, 10): 16\n- (3, 9): 16\n- (4, 8): 16\n- (5, 7): 16\n- (6, 6): 6\n\nAdding these, we find the total number of favorable outcomes is:\n\\[\n16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 6 = 70\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Total Possible Outcomes\nTo find the total number of ways to choose any 2 cards from a 52-card deck, we use the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{52}{2} = \\frac{52 \\times 51}{2} = 1326\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Probability\nWe now compute the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes:\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{70}{1326}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Simplify the Fraction\nWe simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{70}{1326} \\) by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{70 \\div 2}{1326 \\div 2} = \\frac{35}{663}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that both randomly drawn cards are numbered cards that total to 12 is:\n\\(\\frac{35}{663}\\)",
  "ground_truth": "There are two cases that we have to consider.\n\n$\\bullet~$ Case 1: The first card is one of 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n\nThere are 32 such cards, so this occurs with probability $\\dfrac{32}{52}$.  For any of these cards, there are 4 cards left in the deck such that the cards sum to 12, so the probability of drawing one is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  Thus, the probability that this case occurs is $\\dfrac{32}{52}\\times\\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{32}{663}$.\n\n$\\bullet~$ Case 2: The first card is a 6.\n\nThere are 4 of these, so this occurs with probability $\\dfrac{4}{52}$.  Now we need to draw another 6.  There are only 3 left in the deck, so the probability of drawing one is $\\dfrac{3}{51}$.  Thus, the probability that this case occurs is $\\dfrac{4}{52}\\times\\dfrac{3}{51} = \\dfrac{3}{663}$.\n\nTherefore the overall probability is $\\dfrac{32}{663} + \\dfrac{3}{663} = \\boxed{\\frac{35}{663}}. $"
