  "problem": "A rectangular cow pasture is enclosed on three sides by a fence and the fourth side is part of the side of a barn that is $400$ feet long. The fence costs $\\$5$ per foot, and $\\$1,\\!200$ altogether. To the nearest foot, find the length of the side parallel to the barn that will maximize the area of the pasture.",
  "solution": "To maximize the area of a rectangular cow pasture enclosed on three sides by a fence, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Define Variables\nLet:\n- \\( x \\): the length of the side parallel to the barn.\n- \\( y \\): the length of the sides perpendicular to the barn.\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Fence Cost Constraint\nThe total length of the fence required is \\( x + 2y \\). Given that the cost of the fence is $5 per foot and the total budget is $1,200, we can express this as:\n\\[\n5(x + 2y) = 1200\n\\]\nDividing through by 5 simplifies to:\n\\[\nx + 2y = 240 \\quad (1)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( y \\) in Terms of \\( x \\)\nFrom equation (1), we can isolate \\( y \\):\n\\[\n2y = 240 - x \\\\\ny = \\frac{240 - x}{2} \\quad (2)\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Define the Area\nThe area \\( A \\) of the pasture can be expressed as:\n\\[\nA = x \\cdot y\n\\]\nSubstituting equation (2) into the area formula gives:\n\\[\nA = x \\left(\\frac{240 - x}{2}\\right) = \\frac{240x - x^2}{2} = 120x - \\frac{x^2}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Maximize the Area\nTo find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \\( A \\) with respect to \\( x \\) and set it to zero:\n\\[\n\\frac{dA}{dx} = 120 - x\n\\]\nSetting the derivative to zero yields:\n\\[\n120 - x = 0 \\implies x = 120\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Confirm Maximum Area\nTo verify this critical point is a maximum, we check the second derivative:\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2A}{dx^2} = -1\n\\]\nSince this is negative, it confirms that \\( A \\) has a maximum at \\( x = 120 \\).\n\n### Step 7: Calculate Corresponding \\( y \\)\nUsing equation (2) to find \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny = \\frac{240 - 120}{2} = \\frac{120}{2} = 60\n\\]\n\n### Final Conclusion\nTo maximize the area of the pasture, the length of the side parallel to the barn should be:\n\\[\n\\text{Length of the side parallel to the barn} = 120 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER>120 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let the sides perpendicular to the barn be of length $x$. Notice that there are a total of $1200/5=240$ feet of fencing. Therefore, the side parallel to the barn has length $240-2x$, so the area to be maximized is $240x-2x^2$. Completing the square results in $-2(x-60)^2+7200$, which is maximized when $x=60$. Therefore, the side parallel to the barn has length $240-2(60)=\\boxed{120}$ feet."
