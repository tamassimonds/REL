  "problem": "Mrs. Riley recorded this information from a recent test taken by all of her students. Using the data, what was the average percent score for these $100$ students?\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\n\\multicolumn{2}{c}{}\\\\\\hline\n\\textbf{$\\%$ Score}&\\textbf{Number of Students}\\\\\\hline\n100&7\\\\\\hline\n90&18\\\\\\hline\n80&35\\\\\\hline\n70&25\\\\\\hline\n60&10\\\\\\hline\n50&3\\\\\\hline\n40&2\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
  "solution": "To determine the average percent score for 100 students based on the provided data, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Score for Each Score Group**: Multiply each score by the number of students who received that score.\n\n2. **Sum the Total Scores**: This gives us the combined total score for all 100 students.\n\n3. **Calculate the Average Percent Score**: Divide the total score by the total number of students.\n\nNow, let's perform these calculations step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Scores\n\nWe calculate the total score for each group:\n\n- **100%**: \\(100 \\times 7 = 700\\)\n- **90%**: \\(90 \\times 18 = 1620\\)\n- **80%**: \\(80 \\times 35 = 2800\\)\n- **70%**: \\(70 \\times 25 = 1750\\)\n- **60%**: \\(60 \\times 10 = 600\\)\n- **50%**: \\(50 \\times 3 = 150\\)\n- **40%**: \\(40 \\times 2 = 80\\)\n\n### Step 2: Sum the Total Scores\n\nNow, we add all these total scores together:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Score} = 700 + 1620 + 2800 + 1750 + 600 + 150 + 80 = 7700\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Average Percent Score\n\nWe divide the total score (7700) by the total number of students (100) to find the average percent score:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Percent Score} = \\frac{7700}{100} = 77\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe average percent score for the 100 students is **77%**.",
  "ground_truth": "For simplicity, divide all the percent scores by $10.$ We will account for this later by multiplying by $10.$ The average percent score is equal to the sum of all percent scores divided by the total number of students $(100).$ The sum of all percent scores is $$10\\cdot7+9\\cdot18+8\\cdot35+7\\cdot25+6\\cdot10+5\\cdot3+4\\cdot2=770.$$ Since we divided all the percent scores by $10$ in the beginning, we multiply by $10$ to get that the sum of all percent scores is $770\\cdot10=7700.$ Finally, dividing by the total number of students, we find that the average percent score is $7700/100=\\boxed{77}.$"
