  "problem": "Bob is trying to decide between two cell phone plans. Plan A has no flat fee, but the user must pay $10$ cents per minute on the phone. Plan B requires a one-time fee of $\\$20$, but only requires a payment of $5$ cents per minute on the phone. What is the minimum whole number of minutes Bob has to use the phone for to make Plan B the cheaper plan?",
  "solution": "To determine how many minutes Bob needs to use for Plan B to be cheaper than Plan A, we will compare the costs of each plan.\n\n1. **Cost structure:**\n   - **Plan A** charges $0.10 per minute.\n   - **Plan B** has a one-time fee of $20 and charges $0.05 per minute.\n\n2. **Cost equations:**\n   - The cost for Plan A for \\(m\\) minutes: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of Plan A} = 0.10m\n     \\]\n   - The cost for Plan B for \\(m\\) minutes: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost of Plan B} = 20 + 0.05m\n     \\]\n\n3. **Finding when Plan B is cheaper:**\n   We need to find the smallest integer \\(m\\) such that:\n   \\[\n   20 + 0.05m < 0.10m\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving the inequality:**\n   Rearranging the inequality gives:\n   \\[\n   20 < 0.10m - 0.05m\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this yields:\n   \\[\n   20 < 0.05m\n   \\]\n\n   To solve for \\(m\\), divide both sides by \\(0.05\\):\n   \\[\n   m > \\frac{20}{0.05} = 400\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determining the minimum whole number:**\n   The smallest integer greater than 400 is 401.\n\nTherefore, Bob must use a minimum of **401 minutes** for Plan B to be the cheaper option.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<ANSWER>401</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of minutes that Bob anticipates using. Plan A costs $10x$ cents, while Plan B costs $2000 + 5x$ cents. We therefore have the inequality \\begin{align*}\n2000+5x &< 10x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2000 &< 5x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 400 &< x.\n\\end{align*} The smallest integer $x$ such that $400 < x$ is $401$. Therefore, Bob must use at least $\\boxed{401}$ minutes to make Plan B cheaper."
