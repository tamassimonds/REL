  "problem": "The asymptotes of a hyperbola are $y = x + 1$ and $y = 3 - x.$  Also, the hyperbola passes through $(3,3).$  Find the distance between the foci of the hyperbola.",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of finding the distance between the foci of a hyperbola defined by its asymptotes, we will follow these systematic steps:\n\n### Step 1: Locate the Center of the Hyperbola\nThe asymptotes of the hyperbola are given as \\( y = x + 1 \\) and \\( y = 3 - x \\). To find their intersection, we set the equations equal to each other:\n\n\\[\nx + 1 = 3 - x\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), we find:\n\n\\[\n2x = 2 \\Rightarrow x = 1\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 1 \\) into one of the asymptote equations to find \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\ny = 1 + 1 = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the center of the hyperbola is at the point \\( (1, 2) \\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Hyperbola's Form\nWith slopes of the asymptotes being \\( 1 \\) and \\( -1 \\), we conclude that the hyperbola is of the form:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(y - 2)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x - 1)^2}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nSince the slopes suggest \\( \\frac{a}{b} = 1 \\), we deduce that \\( a = b \\).\n\n### Step 3: Use a Given Point to Find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)\nThe hyperbola passes through the point \\( (3, 3) \\). We substitute these coordinates into the hyperbola equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(3 - 2)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(3 - 1)^2}{a^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a^2} - \\frac{4}{a^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nCombining the fractions yields:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-3}{a^2} = 1 \\Rightarrow -3 = a^2 \\implies a^2 = 3\n\\]\n\nSince \\( a = b \\), we also have \\( b^2 = 3 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Distance Between the Foci\nThe distance between the foci of a hyperbola is given by \\( 2c \\), where \\( c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). Given that \\( a^2 = b^2 = 3 \\):\n\n\\[\nc = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{3 + 3} = \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance between the foci is:\n\n\\[\n2c = 2\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe distance between the foci of the hyperbola is \\( 2\\sqrt{6} \\).",
  "ground_truth": "The intersection of the asymptotes is $(1,2),$ so this is the center of the hyperbola.  Since the slopes of the asymptotes are $\\pm 1,$ the equation of the hyperbola can be written in the form\n\\[(x - 1)^2 - (y - 2)^2 = d\\]for some constant $d.$  Setting $x = 3$ and $y = 3,$ we get $d = 3,$ so the equation is\n\\[\\frac{(x - 1)^2}{3} - \\frac{(y - 2)^2}{3} = 1.\\]Then $a^2 = 3$ and $b^2 = 3,$ so $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 6,$ which means $c = \\sqrt{6}.$  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = \\boxed{2 \\sqrt{6}}.$"
