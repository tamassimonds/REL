  "problem": "The increasing sequence $1,3,4,9,10,12,13\\cdots$ consists of all those positive integers which are powers of 3 or sums of distinct powers of 3. Find the $100^{\\mbox{th}}$ term of this sequence.\n",
  "solution": "To find the \\(100^{\\text{th}}\\) term of the sequence consisting of all positive integers that are powers of \\(3\\) or sums of distinct powers of \\(3\\), we can leverage a binary representation analogy.\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence**: The sequence includes numbers that can be expressed as sums of distinct powers of \\(3\\):\n   \\[\n   a_0 \\cdot 3^0 + a_1 \\cdot 3^1 + a_2 \\cdot 3^2 + \\ldots + a_n \\cdot 3^n\n   \\]\n   where \\(a_i\\) can be \\(0\\) or \\(1\\). This means each number corresponds to a unique combination of powers of \\(3\\), similar to how binary numbers can represent powers of \\(2\\).\n\n2. **Binary Representation**: The crucial insight is that the numbers in our sequence align with the positive integers when expressed in binary. For example:\n   - Binary \\(1\\) corresponds to \\(3^0\\).\n   - Binary \\(10\\) corresponds to \\(3^1\\).\n   - Binary \\(11\\) corresponds to \\(3^0 + 3^1\\), and so forth.\n\n3. **Finding the \\(100^{\\text{th}}\\) Term**:\n   - Convert \\(100\\) from decimal to binary:\n     - \\(100 \\div 2 = 50\\) (remainder \\(0\\))\n     - \\(50 \\div 2 = 25\\) (remainder \\(0\\))\n     - \\(25 \\div 2 = 12\\) (remainder \\(1\\))\n     - \\(12 \\div 2 = 6\\) (remainder \\(0\\))\n     - \\(6 \\div 2 = 3\\) (remainder \\(0\\))\n     - \\(3 \\div 2 = 1\\) (remainder \\(1\\))\n     - \\(1 \\div 2 = 0\\) (remainder \\(1\\))\n\n   The binary representation of \\(100\\) is \\(1100100_2\\).\n\n4. **Interpreting the Binary as Sums of Powers of \\(3\\)**:\n   - Map the binary digits to powers of \\(3\\):\n     \\[\n     1 \\cdot 3^6 + 1 \\cdot 3^5 + 0 \\cdot 3^4 + 0 \\cdot 3^3 + 1 \\cdot 3^2 + 0 \\cdot 3^1 + 0 \\cdot 3^0\n     \\]\n   - This expression simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     3^6 + 3^5 + 3^2 = 729 + 243 + 9 = 981\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the \\(100^{\\text{th}}\\) term of the sequence is \\(\\boxed{981}\\).",
  "ground_truth": "Rewrite all of the terms in base 3. Since the numbers are sums of distinct powers of 3, in base 3 each number is a sequence of 1s and 0s (if there is a 2, then it is no longer the sum of distinct powers of 3). Therefore, we can recast this into base 2 (binary) in order to determine the 100th number. $100$ is equal to $64 + 32 + 4$, so in binary form we get $1100100$. However, we must change it back to base 10 for the answer, which is $3^6 + 3^5 + 3^2 = 729 + 243 + 9 = \\boxed{981}$."
