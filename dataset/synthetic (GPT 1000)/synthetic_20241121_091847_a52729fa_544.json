  "problem": "The perimeter of a particular square and the circumference of a particular circle are equal. What is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
  "solution": "To determine the ratio of the area of a square to the area of a circle when their perimeter and circumference are equal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the variables**: \n   - Let \\( s \\) be the side length of the square.\n   - Let \\( r \\) be the radius of the circle.\n\n2. **Formulas for perimeter and circumference**:\n   - The perimeter \\( P \\) of the square is given by:\n     \\[\n     P = 4s\n     \\]\n   - The circumference \\( C \\) of the circle is given by:\n     \\[\n     C = 2\\pi r\n     \\]\n\n3. **Set them equal**: Since the perimeter of the square equals the circumference of the circle:\n   \\[\n   4s = 2\\pi r\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( s \\)**: \n   - Rearranging the equation, we get:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{2\\pi r}{4} = \\frac{\\pi r}{2}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the area of the square**:\n   - The area \\( A_s \\) of the square is:\n     \\[\n     A_s = s^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\pi r}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2 r^2}{4}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the area of the circle**:\n   - The area \\( A_c \\) of the circle is:\n     \\[\n     A_c = \\pi r^2\n     \\]\n\n7. **Find the ratio of the areas**: \n   - The ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{A_s}{A_c} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi^2 r^2}{4}}{\\pi r^2}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying this expression yields:\n     \\[\n     = \\frac{\\pi^2 r^2}{4\\pi r^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n     \\]\n\n8. **State the conclusion clearly**: \n   - Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is \n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\pi}{4}.\n   \\]\n\nIn summary, the final answer is: \n\n<ANSWER> \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) solution </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let $s$ be the side length of the square and $r$ the radius of the circle.  We are given $4s=2\\pi r$ and asked to find $s^2/(\\pi r^2)$.  Squaring both sides of the equation we obtain $16s^2=4\\pi^2r^2$.  We divide by $16\\pi r^2$ to find $s^2/(\\pi r^2)=\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$."
