  "problem": "Billy is hiking in Colorado. He walks eastward four miles, then turns $60$ degrees northward and walks six miles. How far is he from his starting point? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
  "solution": "To determine how far Billy is from his starting point after his hike, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Path Overview**:\n   - Billy begins at point \\( A \\).\n   - He walks 4 miles east to point \\( B \\).\n   - Next, he turns 60 degrees towards the north and walks 6 miles to point \\( D \\).\n\n2. **Understanding His Movement**:\n   - The segment \\( AB \\) is 4 miles long, heading east.\n   - His 60-degree turn northward creates a right triangle with segment \\( BD \\) being 6 miles long.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Triangle**:\n   - The angle between eastward line \\( AB \\) and segment \\( BD \\) is 60 degrees.\n   - This forms a 30-60-90 triangle:\n     - The side opposite the 30-degree angle (segment \\( BC \\)) is half the length of the hypotenuse (segment \\( BD \\)).\n     - The side opposite the 60-degree angle (segment \\( CD \\)) is \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) times the side opposite the 30-degree angle.\n\n4. **Calculating Distances**:\n   - For triangle \\( BCD \\):\n     - The length of \\( BC \\) (eastward distance):\n       \\[\n       BC = 6 \\cdot \\cos(60^\\circ) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 3 \\text{ miles}\n       \\]\n     - The length of \\( CD \\) (northward distance):\n       \\[\n       CD = 6 \\cdot \\sin(60^\\circ) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 3\\sqrt{3} \\text{ miles}\n       \\]\n\n5. **Total Distances**:\n   - The total eastward distance from \\( A \\) to \\( D \\):\n     \\[\n     AD = AB + BC = 4 + 3 = 7 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n   - The total northward distance from \\( A \\) to \\( D \\) is simply \\( CD = 3\\sqrt{3} \\text{ miles} \\).\n\n6. **Calculating the Straight-Line Distance**:\n   - We apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance \\( AD \\) to point \\( D \\):\n   \\[\n   AD = \\sqrt{(7)^2 + (3\\sqrt{3})^2}\n   \\]\n   - Breaking this down:\n   \\[\n   AD = \\sqrt{49 + 27} = \\sqrt{76}\n   \\]\n   - Simplifying \\( \\sqrt{76} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{76} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 19} = 2\\sqrt{19}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Final Result**:\n   - Therefore, the distance from his starting point is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{2\\sqrt{19}}.\n   \\]",
  "ground_truth": "Suppose Billy starts at point $A$, turns at point $B$, and ends at point $D$, as shown below. If Billy turns $60^{\\circ}$ northward and walks six miles, then we can draw a $30-60-90$ triangle whose hypotenuse is $6$ miles (triangle $BCD$ below).\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\n\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7) + fontsize(10));\npair A,B,C,D;\nA = (0,0);\nB=(4,0);\nC =(7,0);\nD = (7,3*sqrt(3));\ndraw (A--B--D--A);\ndraw(B--C--D,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$4$\",B/2,S);\nlabel(\"$6$\",(B+D)/2,NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\n[/asy]\nIt follows that Billy traveled $6/2 = 3$ miles eastward during these $6$ miles, and that he traveled $3 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}$ miles northward during these $6$ miles. In total, Billy traveled $4 + 3 = 7$ miles eastward and $3\\sqrt{3}$ miles northward. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance from his starting point is $\\sqrt{(7)^2 + (3\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 27} = \\sqrt{76} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{19}}.$"
