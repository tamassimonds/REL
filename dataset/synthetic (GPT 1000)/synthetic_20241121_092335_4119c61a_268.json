  "problem": "The circular region of the sign (below, left) has an area of 154 square inches. Vanessa would like to place a tiny ribbon (shaded) around the circle's edge. To be sure she has enough ribbon, she decides to buy 2 inches more of the ribbon than the original circle's circumference. How many inches of ribbon will Vanessa need to buy if she estimates $\\pi = \\frac{22}{7}$?\n\n[asy]import graph;\nsize(125,72.5);\npicture p;\ndraw(p,unitsquare);\nfilldraw(p,Circle((.5,.5),.3),white);\nlabel(p,\"Enter\",(.5,.5),ZapfChancery(\"m\",\"n\"));\nadd(p);\nfilldraw(Circle((2,.5),.4),gray(.6));\nadd(shift(1.5*right)*p);\ndraw((1.1,.5)--(1.4,.5),EndArrow(5,25));[/asy]",
  "solution": "To determine how much ribbon Vanessa needs to buy, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the radius of the circle using its area:**\n   The area \\( A \\) of a circle is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   Given that the area is 154 square inches, we can set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   154 = \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   Using the approximation \\( \\pi \\approx \\frac{22}{7} \\), we substitute this value into the equation:\n   \\[\n   154 = \\frac{22}{7} r^2\n   \\]\n   To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides by 7:\n   \\[\n   154 \\times 7 = 22 r^2\n   \\]\n   Calculating the left side gives:\n   \\[\n   1078 = 22 r^2\n   \\]\n   We then divide both sides by 22 to isolate \\( r^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   r^2 = \\frac{1078}{22} = 49\n   \\]\n   Taking the square root of both sides yields:\n   \\[\n   r = 7 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the circumference of the circle:**\n   The circumference \\( C \\) is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   C = 2 \\pi r\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( r = 7 \\) inches and using \\( \\pi \\approx \\frac{22}{7} \\):\n   \\[\n   C = 2 \\times \\frac{22}{7} \\times 7\n   \\]\n   Here, the 7 cancels out, resulting in:\n   \\[\n   C = 2 \\times 22 = 44 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total amount of ribbon needed:**\n   Vanessa decides to purchase an additional 2 inches beyond the circumference:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ribbon needed} = C + 2 = 44 + 2 = 46 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total amount of ribbon Vanessa needs to buy is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{46} \\text{ inches}\n\\] \n\nFinal solution: <ANSWER>46 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Say the radius of the circle is $r$. Then the area of the circle is $\\pi r^2,$ which we estimate to $154=\\frac{22}{7}r^2$. If we multiply both sides by $\\frac{7}{22}$, we get $r^2=49$ or $r=7$. The circle's circumference is $2\\pi r$, which we again estimate to $\\frac{44}{7}r=44$. Vanessa wants two extra inches of ribbon, so she needs to buy $44+2=\\boxed{46}$ inches of ribbon."
