  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like how I'd naturally think through it. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n### **Initial Thoughts**\n\nSo, we're dealing with a quadratic function \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\). The problem shows a portion of its graph with grid lines spaced 1 unit apart. Our goal is to find the value of \\( a + b + 2c \\).\n\n**First Impressions:**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Hmm, this looks like a typical problem where I need to determine the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) of a quadratic equation. I remember using points from the graph to set up equations before.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. Identify key points on the graph (like the vertex and intercepts) to create equations.\n  2. Use the symmetry properties of parabolas.\n  3. Complete the square to find the vertex form.\n\n- **Reflection:** I\u2019m leaning towards using key points since that's a straightforward way to determine the coefficients. But wait, since I can't actually see the graph, I'll need to rely on the problem's description or any hints provided.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Identify Key Points**\n\n- **Thought Process:** If I can pick three distinct points on the parabola, I can plug them into the equation \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\) to create a system of equations and solve for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n- **Challenge:** Uh-oh, I realize I don't have the graph in front of me. This makes it tricky because I can't visually pick points.\n\n**Realization:**\n\n- **Reflection:** Oh, I see I made an error here. Since I can't see the graph, I'll need to rely on the problem's description or any hints given. Let\u2019s look back at the problem.\n\n#### **Alternative Strategy: Analyzing Given Information**\n\n- **Thought Process:** The problem includes an [asy] diagram with specific settings. Maybe I can interpret these to extract information about the graph.\n\n- **Key Observations:**\n  - The function defined is \\( f(x) = 8 - (x+1)^2 \\).\n  - This is already in the form of a quadratic equation.\n\n- **Mapping to Standard Form:**\n  \\[\n  f(x) = 8 - (x + 1)^2 = 8 - (x^2 + 2x + 1) = -x^2 - 2x + 7\n  \\]\n  So, comparing with \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we have:\n  - \\( a = -1 \\)\n  - \\( b = -2 \\)\n  - \\( c = 7 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** This seems too straightforward. Let me double-check the expansion to ensure no mistakes.\n\n- **Checking Calculation:**\n  - Expanding \\( (x + 1)^2 \\): \n    \\[\n    (x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1\n    \\]\n  - So,\n    \\[\n    8 - (x^2 + 2x + 1) = 8 - x^2 - 2x - 1 = -x^2 - 2x + 7\n    \\]\n  - **Conclusion:** Yup, the coefficients are correct.\n\n### **Computing \\( a + b + 2c \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Now that I have \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\):**\n  \\[\n  a + b + 2c = -1 + (-2) + 2(7)\n  \\]\n\n- **Calculations:**\n  \\[\n  = -1 - 2 + 14 = 11\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Adding and multiplying the coefficients seems straightforward, but let me do a quick mental check:\n  - \\( -1 - 2 = -3 \\)\n  - \\( 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\)\n  - \\( -3 + 14 = 11 \\)\n  \n- **Conclusion:** The calculation is correct.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Wait, Let's Double-Check Everything:**\n  - Is the expansion of \\( (x + 1)^2 \\) correct? Yes.\n  - Did I correctly identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\)? Yes.\n  - Is the computation of \\( a + b + 2c \\) accurate? Yes.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Everything Checks Out:** The steps align, and the calculations are consistent. It seems the approach was correct from the start once the equation was properly expanded.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>11 solution</ANSWER>\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nBy expanding the given quadratic function \\( f(x) = 8 - (x + 1)^2 \\), we identified the coefficients as:\n- \\( a = -1 \\)\n- \\( b = -2 \\)\n- \\( c = 7 \\)\n\nThen, calculating \\( a + b + 2c \\):\n\\[\na + b + 2c = -1 + (-2) + 2(7) = 11\n\\]\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n**Alternative Strategies Considered:**\n\n- Initially thought of identifying key points on the graph, but realized it wasn't feasible without visual access.\n- Instead, focused on expanding the given equation to extract coefficients.\n\n**Reflection and Checking:**\n\n- Consistently checked each step for correctness.\n- Ensured that the expansion and arithmetic were accurate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The value of \\( a + b + 2c \\) is **11**, confirmed through careful calculation and reflection.\n\n---\n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you need further clarification.",
  "ground_truth": "Note that \\begin{align*}\nf(0) &= a(0)^2+b(0)+c \\\\\n&=c\n\\end{align*}and \\begin{align*}\nf(1) &= a(1)^2+b(1)+c \\\\\n&=a+b+c.\n\\end{align*}Thus, \\begin{align*}\na+b+2c &= c + (a+b+c) \\\\\n&= f(0)+f(1).\n\\end{align*}The graph of $y=f(x)$ passes through $(0,7)$ and $(1,4)$, so $f(0)=7$ and $f(1)=4$. Therefore, $a+b+2c = 7 + 4 = \\boxed{11}$."
