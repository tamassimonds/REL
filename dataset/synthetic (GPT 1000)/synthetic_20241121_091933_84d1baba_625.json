  "problem": "The science club has 25 members: 10 boys and 15 girls.  A 5-person committee is chosen at random.  What is the probability that the committee has at least 1 boy and at least 1 girl?",
  "solution": "To find the probability that a randomly selected 5-person committee from a science club with 25 members (10 boys and 15 girls) includes at least one boy and one girl, we can use complementary counting. Here\u2019s the streamlined solution:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Number of Committees\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of ways to choose any 5 members from the 25 members of the club using the combination formula \\( C(n, k) \\):\n\n\\[\nC(25, 5) = \\frac{25!}{5!(25 - 5)!} = 53130\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Committees Composed Only of Boys\n\nNext, we find the number of committees consisting entirely of boys. With 10 boys, this is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nC(10, 5) = 252\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Committees Composed Only of Girls\n\nNow, we determine the number of committees made up entirely of girls. With 15 girls, we calculate:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 5) = 3003\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Total Same-Gender Committees\n\nWe add the committees composed only of boys and those composed only of girls to find the total number of same-gender committees:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total same gender committees} = C(10, 5) + C(15, 5) = 252 + 3003 = 3255\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Committees with At Least One Boy and One Girl\n\nTo find the number of committees that have at least one boy and one girl, we subtract the total same-gender committees from the total number of committees:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Committees with at least one boy and one girl} = C(25, 5) - \\text{Total same gender committees} = 53130 - 3255 = 49875\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Probability\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected committee includes at least one boy and one girl is the ratio of the number of mixed-gender committees to the total number of committees:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least 1 boy and 1 girl}) = \\frac{49875}{53130}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Simplify the Fraction\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of 49875 and 53130, which is 105:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{49875 \\div 105}{53130 \\div 105} = \\frac{475}{506}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the probability that the committee includes at least one boy and at least one girl is:\n\n\\(\\frac{475}{506}\\)",
  "ground_truth": "We can use the idea of complementary probability to solve this problem without too much nasty casework. The probability that the committee has at least 1 boy and 1 girl is equal to 1 minus the probability that the committee is either all boys or all girls. The number of ways to choose a committee of all boys is $\\binom{10}{5}=252$, the number of ways to choose a committee of all girls is $\\binom{15}{5}=3,\\!003$, and the total number of committees is $\\binom{25}{5}=53,\\!130$, so the probability of selecting a committee of all boys or all girls is $\\dfrac{252+3003}{53,\\!130}=\\dfrac{31}{506}$. Thus the probability that the committee contains at least one boy and one girl is $1-\\dfrac{31}{506} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{475}{506}}$."
