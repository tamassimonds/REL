  "problem": "Stan drove 300 miles in 5 hours, 20 minutes. Next, he drove 360 miles in 6 hours, 40 minutes. What was Stan's average speed in miles per hour for the total trip?",
  "solution": "Sure, let's put it all together into a polished, coherent solution while ensuring we maintain the original thought process. Here's how it would look:\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this. Stan drove two separate distances:\n\n1. **First Leg:** 300 miles in 5 hours and 20 minutes.\n2. **Second Leg:** 360 miles in 6 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nOur goal is to find his **average speed** in miles per hour (mph) for the **entire trip**.\n\n---\n\n### **Initial Brainstorming: How to Approach This?**\n\nImmediately, I\u2019m thinking about average speed formulas. I know that average speed is generally total distance divided by total time. But wait, should I calculate the speed for each leg separately and then average those? Or just combine everything at once?\n\nHmm, this reminds me of problems where mixing averages can be tricky\u2014like when different time intervals are involved. **Better to stick with the total distance over total time** to avoid complications.\n\nBut before I settle on that, let's explore both strategies:\n\n1. **Strategy A:** Calculate average speed for each leg, then average those speeds.\n2. **Strategy B:** Compute total distance and total time, then find the average speed.\n\nI\u2019ll try **Strategy A** first to see if it works.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy A: Calculating Average Speed for Each Leg Separately**\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate the average speed for the first leg.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{300 \\text{ miles}}{5 \\text{ hours and } 20 \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, I need to convert 20 minutes into hours to keep the units consistent. **20 minutes is \\(\\frac{20}{60} = 0.333\\) hours.**\n\nSo, the total time for the first leg is **5.333 hours**.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{300}{5.333} \\approx 56.25 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the average speed for the second leg.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{360 \\text{ miles}}{6 \\text{ hours and } 40 \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]\n\nAgain, converting 40 minutes into hours: \\(\\frac{40}{60} = 0.667\\) hours.\n\nTotal time for the second leg is **6.667 hours**.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{360}{6.667} \\approx 54.00 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Averaging the two speeds.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{56.25 + 54.00}{2} = 55.125 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\n**Hmm, but wait**\u2014does this really reflect the overall average speed? Each leg had different durations, so simply averaging the speeds might not be accurate. **This approach might be flawed**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection: Is Strategy A Correct?**\n\nNow that I think about it, averaging the speeds directly **doesn't account for the different durations** of each leg. This reminds me of weighted averages\u2014where longer durations should have more influence on the overall average.\n\n**Conclusion:** **Strategy A is incorrect.** I need to consider the total distance and total time together.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy B: Total Distance Over Total Time**\n\nLet's proceed with Strategy B, which seems more straightforward and likely correct.\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate the total distance.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Distance} = 300 \\text{ miles} + 360 \\text{ miles} = 660 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the total time.\n\nFirst, convert all time to hours:\n\n- **First Leg:** 5 hours and 20 minutes = 5.333 hours\n- **Second Leg:** 6 hours and 40 minutes = 6.667 hours\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time} = 5.333 \\text{ hours} + 6.667 \\text{ hours} = 12 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nWait, let me double-check that:\n\n\\[\n5.333 + 6.667 = 12 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThat adds up correctly. **Looks good!**\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the average speed.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} = \\frac{660 \\text{ miles}}{12 \\text{ hours}} = 55 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work: Does This Make Sense?**\n\nLet me think about whether this result makes sense. An average speed of **55 mph** for the entire trip seems reasonable, especially considering the individual speeds were around 56.25 mph and 54.00 mph.\n\nQuick mental check: \n\n- **Total Distance:** 660 miles\n- **Total Time:** 12 hours\n\n\\[\n\\frac{660}{12} = 55 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out. **Strategy B is correct.**\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Verifying with Weighted Averages**\n\nJust to be sure, let\u2019s verify using a weighted average approach, where each leg's speed is weighted by its time.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weighted Average Speed} = \\frac{(56.25 \\times 5.333) + (54.00 \\times 6.667)}{5.333 + 6.667}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\n\\[\n(56.25 \\times 5.333) + (54.00 \\times 6.667) = 300 + 360 = 660\n\\]\n\nDenominator:\n\n\\[\n5.333 + 6.667 = 12\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Weighted Average Speed} = \\frac{660}{12} = 55 \\text{ mph}\n\\]\n\nThis confirms our previous calculation. **The average speed is indeed 55 mph.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection: Ensuring Correctness**\n\nThinking back to the initial approach, it's clear that calculating the total distance and total time provided the most accurate average speed. Averaging individual speeds without considering the time each speed was maintained would have led to an incorrect result.\n\nIt's always important to ensure that different time intervals are appropriately accounted for when calculating averages.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>\n\n**Stan's average speed for the total trip was 55 miles per hour.**\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Summary: Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** Calculate the average speed over two different legs of a trip.\n   \n2. **Exploring Strategies:**\n   - **Strategy A:** Average the speeds of both legs (found to be incorrect).\n   - **Strategy B:** Use total distance over total time (correct approach).\n\n3. **Calculating Total Distance:** \n   \\[\n   300 \\text{ miles} + 360 \\text{ miles} = 660 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating Total Time:** \n   \\[\n   5.333 \\text{ hours} + 6.667 \\text{ hours} = 12 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating Average Speed:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{660 \\text{ miles}}{12 \\text{ hours}} = 55 \\text{ mph}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verification:** Used weighted average to confirm the result.\n\n7. **Final Answer:** \n   \\[\n   \\text{Stan's average speed is } 55 \\text{ mph}\n   \\]\n   \nBy carefully considering different strategies and verifying the calculations, we ensured the solution was accurate and reliable.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if there's anything else you'd like to adjust!",
  "ground_truth": "Average speed is defined as total distance traveled divided by time traveled. In total, Stan drove 660 miles and it took him 12 hours. His average speed was $660/12=600/12+60/12=50+5=\\boxed{55}$ miles per hour."
