  "problem": "The graphs of a function $f(x)=3x+b$ and its inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ intersect at the point $(-3,a)$. Given that $b$ and $a$ are both integers, what is the value of $a$?",
  "solution": "Absolutely, let's streamline the solution while maintaining the original thought process. I'll summarize each step, ensuring clarity and coherence, and incorporate human-like reflections to keep it authentic.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, the question states that the graphs of a function \\( f(x) = 3x + b \\) and its inverse \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) intersect at the point \\((-3, a)\\), where both \\( b \\) and \\( a \\) are integers. We need to find the value of \\( a \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Intersection of Function and Inverse:** I remember that if a function and its inverse intersect, the point lies on both graphs. This means \\((-3, a)\\) satisfies both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n\n- **Finding the Inverse:** To involve both the function and its inverse, maybe I should find \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) explicitly.\n\n- **Solving Simultaneously:** Once I have both functions, I can set them equal at the point of intersection to solve for \\( b \\) and \\( a \\).\n\n*Is this the right path? Hmm, it seems logical to start by finding the inverse. Let's see where it leads.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Determining the Inverse Function**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo find the inverse \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), I'll need to solve \\( y = f(x) \\) for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nGiven \\( f(x) = 3x + b \\), let's set \\( y = 3x + b \\). Solving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\ny = 3x + b \\implies 3x = y - b \\implies x = \\frac{y - b}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the inverse function is:\n\n\\[\nf^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x - b}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n*Does this make sense? If I plug \\( x \\) into \\( f \\) and then into \\( f^{-1} \\), I should get the original input back. Quick mental check confirms that this inverse is correct.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Using the Intersection Point \\((-3, a)\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSince \\((-3, a)\\) lies on both \\( f(x) \\) and \\( f^{-1}(x) \\), I can substitute these coordinates into both functions.\n\n**Substituting into \\( f(x) \\):**\n\n\\[\nf(-3) = 3(-3) + b = -9 + b = a\n\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[\na = -9 + b \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Substituting into \\( f^{-1}(x) \\):**\n\n\\[\nf^{-1}(-3) = \\frac{-3 - b}{3} = a\n\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{-3 - b}{3} \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*Now I have two equations involving \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). I can use them to solve for both variables. This seems to be on the right track.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Equations Recap:**\n\n1. \\( a = -9 + b \\)\n2. \\( a = \\frac{-3 - b}{3} \\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI can set these two expressions for \\( a \\) equal to each other to eliminate \\( a \\) and solve for \\( b \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n-9 + b = \\frac{-3 - b}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, I'll multiply both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\n3(-9 + b) = -3 - b \\implies -27 + 3b = -3 - b\n\\]\n\nNow, let's bring all terms involving \\( b \\) to one side:\n\n\\[\n3b + b = -3 + 27 \\implies 4b = 24\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n\n*Does this value make sense? Let's plug \\( b = 6 \\) back into Equation 1 to find \\( a \\):*\n\n\\[\na = -9 + 6 = -3\n\\]\n\n*Wait, let me double-check by substituting \\( b = 6 \\) into Equation 2:*\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{-3 - 6}{3} = \\frac{-9}{3} = -3\n\\]\n\n*Both equations agree that \\( a = -3 \\). Looks good!*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, it's essential to verify that the solution satisfies the original conditions.\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- With \\( b = 6 \\), the function becomes \\( f(x) = 3x + 6 \\).\n- The inverse is \\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x - 6}{3} \\).\n\nLet's check the intersection point \\((-3, -3)\\):\n\n- **For \\( f(x) \\):** \n  \\[\n  f(-3) = 3(-3) + 6 = -9 + 6 = -3\n  \\]\n  So, \\( f(-3) = -3 \\), which matches \\( a \\).\n\n- **For \\( f^{-1}(x) \\):** \n  \\[\n  f^{-1}(-3) = \\frac{-3 - 6}{3} = \\frac{-9}{3} = -3\n  \\]\n  So, \\( f^{-1}(-3) = -3 \\), which also matches \\( a \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n*Both the function and its inverse yield the correct \\( a \\) value at the intersection point. This confirms that our solution is correct.*\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{a = -3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically finding the inverse function, applying the given intersection point to both the function and its inverse, and solving the resulting equations, we determined that \\( a = -3 \\). Throughout the process, regular checks ensured that each step was correct, leading to a verified and accurate solution.\n\n---\n\n*And there we have it! By carefully walking through each step, reflecting along the way, and verifying the final outcome, we've successfully solved the problem.*",
  "ground_truth": "Since the graph of $f$ contains the point $(-3,a)$, we know that  \\[a=f(-3)=3(-3)+b=b-9.\\]Since the graph of $f^{-1}$ also contains this point we know that $f^{-1}(-3)=a$ or $-3=f(a)$.  Therefore \\[-3=f(a)=3a+b.\\]Substitution for $a$ gives \\[-3=3(b-9)+b=4b-27.\\]Therefore $b=\\frac14(27-3)=6$. This forces \\[a=b-9=6-9=\\boxed{-3}.\\]One could also recall that the graph of $f$ is a line and the graph of $f^{-1}$ is that line reflected through $y=x$.  Since the slopes of these lines are not 1, the lines both intersect $y=x$ at a single point and that point is also the point of intersection of the graphs of $f$ and $f^{-1}$.  Therefore the intersection point must be $(-3,-3)$, giving $a=\\boxed{-3}$."
