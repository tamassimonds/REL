  "solution": "To find the least positive integer \\( n \\) that satisfies a series of congruences, we start by rewriting the conditions based on the provided remainders:\n\n1. \\( n \\equiv 4 \\mod 5 \\)\n2. \\( n \\equiv 5 \\mod 6 \\)\n3. \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 7 \\)\n4. \\( n \\equiv 7 \\mod 8 \\)\n5. \\( n \\equiv 8 \\mod 9 \\)\n6. \\( n \\equiv 9 \\mod 10 \\)\n\nEach congruence can be rephrased to express \\( n + 1 \\) as a multiple of the respective modulus:\n\n- For all congruences, we can express:\n  \\[\n  n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod k\n  \\]\nwhich translates these conditions into:\n1. \\( n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\)\n2. \\( n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 6 \\)\n3. \\( n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 7 \\)\n4. \\( n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 8 \\)\n5. \\( n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 9 \\)\n6. \\( n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 10 \\)\n\nLetting \\( m = n + 1 \\), we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\n\nTo calculate the LCM, we must consider the prime factorization of each number:\n- \\( 5 = 5 \\)\n- \\( 6 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\)\n- \\( 7 = 7 \\)\n- \\( 8 = 2^3 \\)\n- \\( 9 = 3^2 \\)\n- \\( 10 = 2 \\cdot 5 \\)\n\nThe LCM takes the highest power of each prime:\n- For \\( 2 \\): highest power is \\( 2^3 \\) from 8\n- For \\( 3 \\): highest power is \\( 3^2 \\) from 9\n- For \\( 5 \\): highest power is \\( 5^1 \\) from 5 and 10\n- For \\( 7 \\): highest power is \\( 7^1 \\) from 7\n\nThus, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\text{lcm}(5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \n\\]\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n1. \\( 2^3 = 8 \\)\n2. \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n3. \\( 8 \\cdot 9 = 72 \\)\n4. \\( 72 \\cdot 5 = 360 \\)\n5. \\( 360 \\cdot 7 = 2520 \\)\n\nThus, we find \\( m = 2520 \\).

  "ground_truth": "Suppose that $N$ is a positive integer satisfying all the given conditions. Note that since $N$ gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, $N+1$ must be divisible by 5. Similarly, $N+1$ is also divisible by 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Thus the least possible value for $N+1$ is the least common multiple of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Prime factorizing these numbers, we find that their least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 = 2520$. Thus the least possible value for $N$ is $\\boxed{2519}$."
