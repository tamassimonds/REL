  "problem": "Jack walked up a hill at a speed of $(x^2-11x-22)$ miles per hour. Meanwhile, Jill walked a total distance of $(x^2-3x-54)$ miles in $(x+6)$ hours. If Jack and Jill walked at the same speed, what is that speed, in miles per hour?",
  "solution": "To determine the walking speed of both Jack and Jill, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Jack's Speed Calculation**: Jack's speed is defined as \\( x^2 - 11x - 22 \\) miles per hour.\n\n2. **Jill's Speed Calculation**: Jill covered a distance of \\( x^2 - 3x - 54 \\) miles in \\( x + 6 \\) hours. Using the formula for speed (\\(\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}\\)), we calculate her speed:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Jill's Speed} = \\frac{x^2 - 3x - 54}{x + 6}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equating Their Speeds**: Since both Jack and Jill walked at the same speed, we set their speed expressions equal:\n\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 11x - 22 = \\frac{x^2 - 3x - 54}{x + 6}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Clearing the Denominator**: To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides by \\( x + 6 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   (x^2 - 11x - 22)(x + 6) = x^2 - 3x - 54\n   \\]\n\n5. **Expanding the Left Side**: Expanding \\( (x^2 - 11x - 22)(x + 6) \\):\n\n   \\[\n   x^3 + 6x^2 - 11x^2 - 66x - 22x - 132 = x^3 - 5x^2 - 132x - 132\n   \\]\n\n6. **Setting Up the Equation**: Now, we equate this to the right-hand side:\n\n   \\[\n   x^3 - 5x^2 - 132x - 132 = x^2 - 3x - 54\n   \\]\n\n7. **Rearranging Terms**: Bringing all terms to one side results in:\n\n   \\[\n   x^3 - 6x^2 - 129x - 78 = 0\n   \\]\n\n8. **Finding Solutions**: We can try possible rational roots. Testing \\( x = 13 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   13^3 - 6(13^2) - 129(13) - 78\n   \\]\n\n   Calculating gives:\n\n   \\[\n   2197 - 1014 - 1677 - 78 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, \\( x = 13 \\) is a valid solution.\n\n9. **Calculating the Speed**: Finally, we substitute \\( x = 13 \\) back into Jack's speed formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = 13^2 - 11(13) - 22 = 169 - 143 - 22 = 4 \\text{ miles per hour}\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, both Jack and Jill walked at a speed of **4 miles per hour**.",
  "ground_truth": "First we find Jill's speed in miles per hour by dividing total distance by time, in which we can cancel a common factor: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{Jill's speed}&=\\frac{x^2-3x-54}{x+6}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=\\frac{(x-9)(x+6)}{x+6}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=(x-9).\n\\end{align*}Now we set the two speeds equal to each other and solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\nx-9&=x^2-11x-22\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=x^2-12x-13\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=(x+1)(x-13).\n\\end{align*}If $x=-1$, we'd get a speed of $-1-9=-10$ miles per hour, which isn't possible. That means $x=13$, so their speed was $13-9=\\boxed{4}$ miles per hour."
