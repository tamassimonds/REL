  "solution": "### **Tackling the Quadratic Problem: A Step-by-Step Approach**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this quadratic problem just like I would naturally\u2014brainstorming, checking my work frequently, and adjusting strategies as needed. Here\u2019s how I tackled it, keeping the final answer intact.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first glanced at the problem, here's what caught my eye:\n\n**Given:**\n\n\\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 2(x - 4)^2 + 8 \\]\n\nThen, transform:\n\n\\[ 3ax^2 + 3bx + 3c \\]\n\ninto:\n\n\\[ n(x - h)^2 + k \\]\n\nand find \\( h \\).\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis seems like a problem involving quadratics, specifically dealing with vertex forms. I vaguely remember that expressing quadratics in vertex form helps identify the vertex, which includes \\( h \\). However, connecting the two given forms directly isn't immediately clear. I might need to explore different strategies to see what fits best.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nLet's brainstorm a few possible approaches:\n\n1. **Expand Both Sides:**  \n   Expand the given vertex form and equate coefficients to find \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n2. **Factor Out Constants:**  \n   Maybe factoring out constants from the second quadratic could simplify it.\n\n3. **Express in Terms of Original Quadratic:**  \n   Consider expressing the second quadratic in terms of the first and see how the vertex form changes.\n\n**Which Strategy to Try First?**  \nExpanding both sides sounds straightforward, so I'll start there. If it doesn't work, I can always pivot to another strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Expanding Both Sides**\n\nLet's expand the given vertex form to match it with \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\n**Given:**  \n\\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 2(x - 4)^2 + 8 \\]\n\n**Expanding the Right Side:**\n\n\\[\n2(x - 4)^2 + 8 = 2(x^2 - 8x + 16) + 8 = 2x^2 - 16x + 32 + 8 = 2x^2 - 16x + 40\n\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 2x^2 - 16x + 40 \\]\n\n**Equating Coefficients:**\n\n- \\( a = 2 \\)\n- \\( b = -16 \\)\n- \\( c = 40 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems straightforward. I now have values for \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). It looks like this approach is working so far. No issues here, so I'll proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding to the Second Quadratic**\n\nNext, let's handle the second quadratic:\n\n\\[ 3ax^2 + 3bx + 3c \\]\n\n**Substituting the Values:**\n\n\\[\n3a = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\\\\n3b = 3 \\times (-16) = -48 \\\\\n3c = 3 \\times 40 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, the quadratic becomes:\n\n\\[ 6x^2 - 48x + 120 \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBy multiplying each coefficient by 3, I've transformed the original quadratic. Now, I need to express this in vertex form to identify \\( h \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Converting to Vertex Form: Completing the Square**\n\nTo express \\( 6x^2 - 48x + 120 \\) in the form \\( n(x - h)^2 + k \\), I'll need to complete the square.\n\n**Step 1: Factor Out the Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):**\n\n\\[\n6(x^2 - 8x) + 120\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Find the Value to Complete the Square:**\n\nTake half of the coefficient of \\( x \\) inside the parentheses, then square it:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{-8}{2}\\right)^2 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Add and Subtract Inside the Parentheses:**\n\n\\[\n6(x^2 - 8x + 16 - 16) + 120 = 6((x - 4)^2 - 16) + 120\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Distribute the 6:**\n\n\\[\n6(x - 4)^2 - 96 + 120 = 6(x - 4)^2 + 24\n\\]\n\nSo, the quadratic in vertex form is:\n\n\\[ 6(x - 4)^2 + 24 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nCompleting the square worked smoothly. I added and subtracted \\( 16 \\) inside the parentheses, which balanced the equation. Multiplying by 6 and adjusting the constant term led me to the correct vertex form.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- Completing the square added \\( 16 \\) inside, multiplied by \\( 6 \\) gives \\( 96 \\) subtracted outside, which added to \\( 120 \\) results in \\( 24 \\).\n- The vertex form looks correct.\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**  \nThe original vertex form had \\( (x - 4)^2 \\), and after scaling by 3, the \\( h \\) value remains \\( 4 \\). This consistency reassures me that the steps are correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEverything checks out. The vertex form is successfully obtained without any errors.\n\n---\n\n### **Extracting the Values**\n\nFrom the vertex form:\n\n\\[ n(x - h)^2 + k = 6(x - 4)^2 + 24 \\]\n\nSo:\n\n- \\( n = 6 \\)\n- \\( h = 4 \\)\n- \\( k = 24 \\)\n\n**<ANSWER> solution 4</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Check**\n\n**Alternative Strategies:**  \nInitially, I considered other methods like factoring out constants or expressing the second quadratic in terms of the first. However, expanding both sides and completing the square proved to be the most effective and straightforward approach.\n\n**Final Check:**  \nBy following each step carefully and checking the work along the way, I ensured that no mistakes were made. The value of \\( h \\) is confidently determined to be \\( 4 \\).\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**  \nAbsolutely. The consistency in the vertex form before and after scaling verifies the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Closing Thoughts**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, selecting the most straightforward one, and meticulously checking each step, I arrived at the correct solution. This approach not only ensured accuracy but also reinforced my understanding of quadratic transformations.\n\n**<ANSWER> solution 4</ANSWER>**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe value of \\( h \\) is indeed \\( 4 \\).",
  "ground_truth": "We have that $ax^2 + bx + c = 2(x - 4)^2 + 8$.  Multiplying both sides by 3, we get \\[3ax^2 + 3bx + 3c = 6(x - 4)^2 + 24.\\]The value of $h$, namely $\\boxed{4}$, remains exactly the same."
