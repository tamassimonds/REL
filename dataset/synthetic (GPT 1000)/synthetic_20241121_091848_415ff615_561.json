  "problem": "The degree measure of the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n$ sides is 1800. What is the degree measure of the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we start by recalling that the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles} = 180(n - 2)\n\\]\n\nWe know the sum of the interior angles for a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is 1800 degrees. We set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n180(n - 2) = 1800\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 180 simplifies the equation to:\n\n\\[\nn - 2 = \\frac{1800}{180}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right side yields:\n\n\\[\nn - 2 = 10\n\\]\n\nAdding 2 to both sides gives us:\n\n\\[\nn = 12\n\\]\n\nThis tells us that the polygon has 12 sides.\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with \\( n + 2 \\) sides, which means we will calculate it for a polygon with \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\) sides. Using the same formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of interior angles for } 14 \\text{ sides} = 180(14 - 2) = 180 \\times 12\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( 180 \\times 12 \\) gives us:\n\n\\[\n180 \\times 12 = 2160\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with 14 sides is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2160}\n\\]\n\nIn conclusion, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>2160 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The sum of the measures of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180^\\circ(n-2)$.  Therefore,  \\[\n180(n-2)=1800 \\implies n=12.\n\\] So $n+2=14$, and the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a 14-gon is $180^\\circ(14-2)=\\boxed{2160}$ degrees."
