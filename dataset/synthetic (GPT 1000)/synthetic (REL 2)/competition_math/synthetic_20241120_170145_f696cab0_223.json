    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each approach, check my work often, and adjust my methods as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, it involves a rectangular picture frame whose outer edges have a specified area, and we know one of the outer edges' lengths. It reminds me of geometry problems involving areas, perimeters, and dimensions. **My initial thoughts are:**\n\n- **Dimensions and Areas:** Perhaps I can use the area to relate the outer and inner dimensions.\n- **Width of the Frame:** The one-inch-wide frame adds an outer perimeter around the picture, which seems crucial.\n- **Solving for Lengths:** Maybe I need to set up equations to find the inner dimensions.\n\nBut honestly, I'm a bit unsure about where to start\u2014especially how to connect the area of the frame to the dimensions. **Let\u2019s brainstorm some strategies.**\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use Area to Find Inner Dimensions:**\n   - Subtract the area of the inner rectangle from the outer rectangle\u2019s area.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations Relating Inner and Outer Dimensions:**\n   - Use the given edge length and the width of the frame to create equations.\n\n3. **Draw and Label the Diagram:**\n   - Visual representation might help in understanding the relationships between dimensions.\n\n4. **Consider the Frame Width in Calculations:**\n   - Since the frame is one inch wide, it affects both length and width.\n\n**Reflection:** **Strategy 1** seems straightforward\u2014calculating areas directly. **Strategy 2**\u2014setting up equations\u2014might give more clarity. **Strategy 3**\u2014drawing\u2014could help visualize but feels secondary. **Strategy 4** is essential since the frame's width is given.\n\nI think starting with **Strategy 1**, using area to find dimensions, might be the most direct. If that feels off, I\u2019ll pivot to setting up equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Outer Area**\n\n**Thoughts:** To find the relationship between the inner and outer dimensions, I need the area of the outer rectangle.\n\nGiven:\n- One outer edge is \\(5\\) inches long.\n- The area of the frame is \\(18\\) square inches.\n\n**Reflection:** **Wait, I don\u2019t have both outer dimensions.** But I know the area of the frame is the area of the outer rectangle minus the inner rectangle\u2019s area.\n\n**Realization:** **Let me adjust my approach.** Perhaps I need to find the missing outer dimension using the area of the frame.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- \\(A_{\\text{inner}}\\) = area of the inner rectangle\n- \\(A_{\\text{outer}}\\) = area of the outer rectangle\n- **Given:** \\( A_{\\text{outer}} - A_{\\text{inner}} = 18\\) square inches\n- **Also given:** One outer dimension is \\(5\\) inches\n\nBut I still don\u2019t have enough information. **I\u2019m stuck here.**\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, maybe this isn\u2019t the right starting point. I need more information about the outer rectangle\u2019s dimensions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Reorient the Approach\u2014Use Frame Width**\n\n**Thoughts:** Since the frame is one inch wide, it affects both dimensions of the outer rectangle.\n\n**New Strategy:** Use the width of the frame to relate the inner and outer dimensions, along with the given area.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- The frame adds \\(1\\) inch to each side of the inner rectangle.\n- Therefore, the outer dimensions are:\n  - Outer length = Inner length + \\(2\\) inches\n  - Outer width = Inner width + \\(2\\) inches\n\nGiven that one outer edge is \\(5\\) inches long, **this could be either outer length or outer width.**\n\n**Reflection:** This seems promising. Let\u2019s assume the \\(5\\)-inch side is the outer length.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Assume the outer length is \\(5\\) inches.**\n   \n   - Let\u2019s denote:\n     - Outer length \\(L_{\\text{outer}} = 5\\) inches\n     - Inner length \\(L_{\\text{inner}} = L_{\\text{outer}} - 2 = 3\\) inches\n     \n     Wait, but that seems small... **Let\u2019s reconsider. Maybe the \\(5\\)-inch side is the outer width instead.**\n\n2. **Reassess\u2014Outer Width is \\(5\\) Inches:**\n   \n   - Outer width = \\(5\\) inches\n   - Inner width = \\(5 - 2 = 3\\) inches\n\n**Check:** **That feels more reasonable.** Let\u2019s proceed with this assumption.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Inner Length**\n\n**Thoughts:** Now that we have the inner width, I need to find the inner length using the area difference.\n\n**Given:**\n- Area of the frame = \\(18\\) square inches\n- Outer area = Inner area + Frame area\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Find the Outer Area:**\n\n   - Outer area \\(A_{\\text{outer}} = \\text{Outer length} \\times \\text{Outer width} = 5 \\times \\text{(inner width + 2)}\\)\n\n   But I need both dimensions, and I only have the outer width and the relation to the inner dimensions. **This is getting confusing.** I might need to use a different approach.\n\n**Reflection:** **Wait, perhaps I need to find the inner dimensions directly by utilizing the area of the frame more efficiently.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Use Area to Find Inner Dimensions\u2014Alternative Approach**\n\n**Thoughts:** Let\u2019s consider the area of the frame in terms of inner and outer dimensions.\n\n**Given:**\n- Area of the frame = Outer area \u2013 Inner area = \\(18\\) square inches\n- One outer dimension = \\(5\\) inches\n\n**Let\u2019s denote:**\n- Inner length = \\(x\\) inches\n- Inner width = \\(y\\) inches\n- Therefore, outer length = \\(x + 2\\) inches\n- Outer width = \\(y + 2\\) inches\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\n\\[A_{\\text{outer}} = (x + 2)(y + 2)\\]\n\\[A_{\\text{frame}} = A_{\\text{outer}} - A_{\\text{inner}}\\]\n\\[18 = ((x + 2)(y + 2)) \u2013 (xy)\\]\n\n**Expanding the Equation:**\n\n\\[18 = (xy + 2x + 2y + 4) \u2013 xy\\]\n\\[18 = 2x + 2y + 4\\]\n\\[2x + 2y = 14\\]\n\\[x + y = 7\\]\n\n**Reflection:** **Okay, so the sum of the inner length and width is \\(7\\) inches.** This feels like a breakthrough.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Relate Inner Dimensions to Outer Dimensions**\n\n**Thoughts:** Knowing the sum of the inner length and width helps in calculating the inner perimeter.\n\n**Given:**\n- One outer dimension is \\(5\\) inches.\n- Outer dimensions are related to inner dimensions by adding \\(2\\) inches to each.\n\n**Let\u2019s denote:**\n- Outer length = \\(5\\) inches\n- Outer width = \\(5 + 2 = 7\\) inches\n\n**But wait, I assumed both outer dimensions were \\(5\\) inches. That\u2019s impossible.** **Let\u2019s correct this.**\n\n**Reassessing:**\n\n- **Given**: One outer edge is \\(5\\) inches long.\n- **Assumption**: Let\u2019s assume the outer width is \\(5\\) inches, then the inner width is \\(5 - 2 = 3\\) inches.\n\nSo now:\n\n- Inner length + inner width = \\(7\\) inches\n- Inner width = \\(3\\) inches\n- Therefore, inner length = \\(7 - 3 = 4\\) inches\n\n**Reflection:** **This makes sense.** The inner dimensions are \\(4\\) inches by \\(3\\) inches.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculate the Sum of the Lengths of the Four Interior Edges**\n\n**Thoughts:** The question asks for the sum of the lengths of the four interior edges, which is essentially the perimeter of the inner rectangle.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **Perimeter \\(P\\) of a rectangle = \\(2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\\)**\n  \n  Given:\n  - Inner length = \\(4\\) inches\n  - Inner width = \\(3\\) inches\n  \n  \\[P = 2 \\times (4 + 3) = 2 \\times 7 = 14\\text{ inches}\\]\n\n**Reflection:** **So, the sum of the lengths of the four interior edges is \\(14\\) inches.** This aligns with the earlier finding that the sum of the inner length and width is \\(7\\) inches, doubled for the perimeter.\n\n**Check:** **Quick check:** Does this seem plausible? The inner dimensions are reasonable, and the calculations follow logically. **Yes, it seems correct.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts and Check**\n\n- **Checking Assumptions:** Initially, I confused which outer dimension was \\(5\\) inches. Correcting this led me to the right inner dimensions.\n- **Reflecting on the Approach:** Using the area to find the relationship between inner and outer dimensions was effective. At first, attempting to calculate the outer area directly was unhelpful without both outer dimensions.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Drawing a diagram or visualizing might have helped verify the dimensions sooner but didn't seem necessary once the area relationship was established.\n- **Conclusion:** The sum of the lengths of the four interior edges is **14 inches**, and the step-by-step approach ensured that each part of the problem was tackled methodically, reflecting and adjusting the strategy as needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, reflecting on which methods were effective, and adjusting my approach when I encountered confusion, I was able to determine that the sum of the lengths of the four interior edges of the frame is **14 inches**. Checking each step ensured accuracy, and acknowledging and correcting initial misassumptions guided me to the correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "The lengths of the top/bottom interior edges are $5-2=3$ inches (since there is 1 inch of frame to either side of the interior rectangular hole). Let the lengths of the left/right interior edges be $x$ inches. Then, the lengths of the left/right exterior edges are $x+2$ inches. The area of the frame is equal to the area of the frame rectangle minus the area of the hole. This is equal to $5\\cdot(x+2)-3x=2x+10$. Since we are given that this area is 18 square inches, we have the equation $2x+10=18\\Rightarrow x=4$. So the dimensions of the interior hole are $3\\times4$. Thus, the sum of the four interior edges is $3+4+3+4=\\boxed{14}$ inches."
