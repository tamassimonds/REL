    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and brainstorm different strategies to find the midpoint between Harry and Sandy\u2019s coordinates. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process, exploring various methods, reflecting often, and checking my work along the way to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n\n- **User Intent:** Harry and Sandy want to meet at the midpoint of their coordinates. Harry is at \\((9, -2)\\), and Sandy is at \\((1, 6)\\). I need to find the coordinate where they meet.\n- **Familiar Concept:** This reminds me of finding the midpoint in geometry, which is commonly done by averaging the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately.\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Maybe I can use the midpoint formula directly, or perhaps visualize it on a graph to confirm. Alternatively, calculating step-by-step might help solidify my understanding.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: Midpoint Formula**\n\n- **Thinking:** The midpoint \\((M_x, M_y)\\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is calculated as:\n  \n  \\[\n  M_x = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\quad M_y = \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Wait, this formula seems straightforward. Would applying it directly give the correct answer? Let\u2019s try it.\n\n**Strategy 2: Graphical Representation**\n\n- **Thinking:** Visualizing the points on a Cartesian plane could help confirm the midpoint intuitively.\n- **Reflection:** Hmm, I don't have a graph here, but perhaps sketching it mentally could work. This might also help catch any errors in calculations later.\n\n**Strategy 3: Averaging Both Coordinates Separately**\n\n- **Thinking:** Instead of using the formula, I could verify by separately averaging the x-coordinates and y-coordinates to see if it aligns with the midpoint formula.\n- **Reflection:** This approach might double-check the correctness of the midpoint formula application.\n\n**Initial Choice: Midpoint Formula**\n\nGiven that the midpoint formula is a standard method for finding the midpoint between two points, I'll start with that. If it doesn't seem right after calculations, I'll reconsider and explore the other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Midpoint Formula**\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nGiven:\n- Harry\u2019s coordinates: \\((x_1, y_1) = (9, -2)\\)\n- Sandy\u2019s coordinates: \\((x_2, y_2) = (1, 6)\\)\n\nLet\u2019s plug these into the midpoint formula:\n\n\\[\nM_x = \\frac{9 + 1}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\nM_y = \\frac{-2 + 6}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\nSo, the midpoint is \\((5, 2)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does \\((5, 2)\\) make sense as a midpoint? Let\u2019s see.\n- **Calculation Verification:**\n  - X-coordinates: \\(\\frac{9 + 1}{2} = 5\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - Y-coordinates: \\(\\frac{-2 + 6}{2} = 2\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- **Conclusion:** The calculations seem correct. But let\u2019s double-check using another method to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying with Averaging Both Coordinates Separately**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Purpose:** To ensure the midpoint formula\u2019s correctness by averaging the x and y coordinates independently.\n  \n**Calculation:**\n\n1. **Average X-coordinates:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9 + 1}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Average Y-coordinates:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-2 + 6}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Result:** Again, we arrive at \\((5, 2)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Consistency Check:** Both methods (midpoint formula and separate averaging) yield the same result. This strengthens the confidence that \\((5, 2)\\) is indeed the correct midpoint.\n- **Mistake Check:** No discrepancies detected. The approach seems valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Visualizing and Final Checking**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Visual Confirmation:** Even without a graph, imagining the coordinates can help. Harry is at \\((9, -2)\\), and Sandy is at \\((1, 6)\\). The midpoint should be equidistant from both points.\n- **Calculation Check:** \n  - Distance from Harry to midpoint: \n    \\[\n    \\sqrt{(9 - 5)^2 + (-2 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 16} = \\sqrt{32} \\approx 5.66\n    \\]\n  - Distance from Sandy to midpoint: \n    \\[\n    \\sqrt{(1 - 5)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(-4)^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 16} = \\sqrt{32} \\approx 5.66\n    \\]\n  \n**Result:** Both distances are equal, confirming that \\((5, 2)\\) is correctly positioned as the midpoint.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Final Check:** The distances from both Harry and Sandy to the midpoint are equal, aligning with the definition of a midpoint. Everything appears correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying calculations through multiple methods, the coordinate where Harry and Sandy will meet is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(5, 2)}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Brainstorming Success:** Starting with the midpoint formula simplifies the problem, and verifying with separate averaging confirms the accuracy.\n- **Importance of Checks:** Cross-checking using different methods ensures that the solution is robust and correct.\n- **Learning Point:** Reflecting and considering alternative approaches helped validate the midpoint calculation, reinforcing the reliability of the answer.\n\nBy thinking through each step, exploring various strategies, and continuously checking the work, I've confidently determined that Harry and Sandy will meet at \\((5, 2)\\).",
