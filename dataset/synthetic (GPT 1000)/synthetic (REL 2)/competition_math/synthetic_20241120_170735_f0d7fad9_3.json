    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together, step by step. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work as I go. The goal is to approach this as naturally as possible, mimicking real human thought processes, with all the messy parts included.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the problem is:  \n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{6}{7}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Familiar Territory:** This looks like a question involving exponents and fractions, something I've encountered before.\n- **Potential Strategies:** Maybe I can use the properties of exponents to simplify it. Or possibly multiply the fractions first before squaring them.\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure if squaring each fraction separately and then multiplying is the best approach. Let\u2019s explore a few strategies to be sure.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Square Each Fraction Individually:**\n   - For \\(\\left(\\frac{6}{7}\\right)^2\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\), calculate each square separately and then multiply the results.\n\n2. **Multiply the Fractions First and Then Square:**\n   - Combine \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) by multiplying them, and then square the resulting fraction.\n\n3. **Use Exponent Properties:**\n   - Consider if there's a property of exponents that can simplify the expression without computing each square separately.\n\n**Reflecting on Strategies:**\n- **Quick Check:** Squaring each fraction separately and then multiplying seems straightforward. But perhaps there's a faster way by multiplying first.\n- **Preference:** I think starting with squaring each fraction might be clearer, especially to ensure I\u2019m not making mistakes along the way.\n\n### **Step 1: Squaring Each Fraction**\n\nLet's begin by squaring each fraction individually.\n\n#### **Calculating \\(\\left(\\frac{6}{7}\\right)^2\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{6}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{6 \\times 6}{7 \\times 7} = \\frac{36}{49}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Checking:** Multiplying the numerator and denominator separately seems correct.\n- **Reflection:** Wait, \\(\\frac{36}{49}\\) can be reduced. Let me simplify it.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{49} = \\frac{36 \\div 1}{49 \\div 1} = \\frac{36}{49} \\quad (\\text{No common factors besides 1})\n\\]\n\n**Mistake Check:**\n- But wait, 36 and 49 don't have common factors other than 1. So, \\(\\frac{36}{49}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n#### **Calculating \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\):**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{2 \\times 2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Doubt:** Should I double-check if \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) can be simplified?\n- **Reflection:** No, \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n### **Step 2: Multiplying the Squared Fractions**\n\nNow, let's multiply the results of the squared fractions.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{49} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{36 \\times 1}{49 \\times 4} = \\frac{36}{196}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Quick Check:** Multiplying the numerators and denominators separately... looks correct.\n- **Simplification:** Can \\(\\frac{36}{196}\\) be reduced?\n\n\\[\n\\frac{36}{196} = \\frac{36 \\div 4}{196 \\div 4} = \\frac{9}{49}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Verification:** Yes, both 36 and 196 are divisible by 4.\n- **Final Answer:** \\(\\frac{9}{49}\\) is in its simplest form.\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Multiplying Before Squaring**\n\n**Strategy:**  \nLet\u2019s see if multiplying the fractions first and then squaring gives the same result.\n\n#### **Step 1: Multiply the Fractions**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{7} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 1}{7 \\times 2} = \\frac{6}{14}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- **Simplification:** \\(\\frac{6}{14}\\) can be reduced.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{14} = \\frac{3}{7}\n\\]\n\n#### **Step 2: Square the Resulting Fraction**\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3 \\times 3}{7 \\times 7} = \\frac{9}{49}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Comparison:** Both methods yield \\(\\frac{9}{49}\\).\n- **Consistency Check:** This confirms that squaring each fraction individually and then multiplying is equivalent to multiplying first and squaring the result.\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\n- **Consistency:** Both approaches\u2014squaring each fraction separately and then multiplying, or multiplying first then squaring\u2014yield the same result: \\(\\frac{9}{49}\\).\n- **Verification:** The calculations were checked at each step, ensuring no mistakes were made.\n- **Conclusion:** The final answer is consistent and correct.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{9}{49}}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Approach Validity:** Starting by squaring each fraction individually was a clear and straightforward method.\n- **Alternative Strategy Benefit:** Exploring the alternative approach (multiplying first) confirmed the correctness of the initial method.\n- **Reflection:** Checking and reflecting frequently helped catch potential simplification steps, ensuring the final answer was in its simplest form.\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, checking each step, and being open to adjusting the approach, we arrived confidently at the correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^j \\cdot \\left(\\frac{c}{d}\\right)^j = \\left(\\frac{a \\cdot c}{b \\cdot d}\\right)^{j}$, we know  $\\left(\\frac{6}{7}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{6 \\cdot 1}{7 \\cdot 2}\\right)^2$.  Simplifying, we have $\\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3^2}{7^2}$, because $\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^n = \\frac{a^n}{b^n}$.  We know $3^2 = 9$ and $7^2 = 49$, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{49}}$."
