    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll tackle it step by step, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work along the way to ensure accuracy. I'll approach it as naturally as possible, thinking out loud and adjusting my methods as needed.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n\\[\n(x,y) = \\left( e^t + e^{-t}, 3 (e^t - e^{-t}) \\right)\n\\]\n\nMy initial reaction is:\n\n- **Familiar Functions:** This expression reminds me of hyperbolic functions, especially since \\( e^t \\) and \\( e^{-t} \\) are involved. I recall that \\( \\cosh(t) \\) and \\( \\sinh(t) \\) are defined in terms of these exponentials.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Substitute Hyperbolic Functions:** Maybe replacing \\( e^t \\) and \\( e^{-t} \\) with their hyperbolic counterparts could simplify the expressions.\n  2. **Express in Terms of a Single Variable:** Another approach could be to express both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in terms of \\( e^t \\) and \\( e^{-t} \\), then see if a relation emerges.\n  3. **Check for Standard Curves:** After substitution, see if the resulting equations resemble known conic sections (line, circle, etc.).\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure which method will be the most straightforward, but starting with hyperbolic substitutions seems promising given the familiarity with hyperbolic identities.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\nI'll explore the first strategy and see how it goes. If it becomes messy or unclear, I'll switch to another approach.\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Substitute Hyperbolic Functions**\n\n1. **Define Hyperbolic Functions:**\n   - Recall that:\n     \\[\n     \\cosh(t) = \\frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\sinh(t) = \\frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Express \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in Terms of \\( \\cosh(t) \\) and \\( \\sinh(t) \\):**\n   - Given:\n     \\[\n     x = e^t + e^{-t} = 2\\cosh(t)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = 3(e^t - e^{-t}) = 6 \\sinh(t)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Express \\( \\cosh(t) \\) and \\( \\sinh(t) \\) in Terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):**\n   - From \\( x = 2\\cosh(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\cosh(t) = \\frac{x}{2}\n     \\]\n   - From \\( y = 6\\sinh(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\sinh(t) = \\frac{y}{6}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Write the Hyperbolic Identity:**\n   - Recall the identity:\n     \\[\n     \\cosh^2(t) - \\sinh^2(t) = 1\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( \\cosh(t) \\) and \\( \\sinh(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{y}{6}\\right)^2 = 1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x^2}{4} - \\frac{y^2}{36} = 1\n     \\]\n\n#### **Reflection: Does This Look Correct?**\n\nUpon substituting into the hyperbolic identity, the equation resembles the standard form of a hyperbola:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{4} - \\frac{y^2}{36} = 1\n\\]\n\nThis seems to align with the characteristics of a hyperbola, where the difference between the squares of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) terms equals one.\n\n### **Strategy 2: Expressing in Terms of a Single Variable**\n\nJust to ensure robustness, let's see if expressing everything in terms of \\( e^t \\) and \\( e^{-t} \\) leads to the same conclusion.\n\n1. **Let \\( u = e^t \\):**\n   - Then, \\( e^{-t} = \\frac{1}{u} \\).\n\n2. **Rewrite \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):**\n   \\[\n   x = u + \\frac{1}{u}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = 3(u - \\frac{1}{u}) = 3u - \\frac{3}{u}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express \\( u \\) in Terms of \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   u + \\frac{1}{u} = x \\implies u^2 - xu + 1 = 0\n   \\]\n   - This is a quadratic equation in \\( u \\).\n\n4. **Find \\( u \\) Using the Quadratic Formula:**\n   \\[\n   u = \\frac{x \\pm \\sqrt{x^2 - 4}}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Substitute \\( u \\) Back into \\( y \\):**\n   \\[\n   y = 3\\left(\\frac{x \\pm \\sqrt{x^2 - 4}}{2} - \\frac{3}{\\frac{x \\pm \\sqrt{x^2 - 4}}{2}}\\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{3}{2}(x \\pm \\sqrt{x^2 - 4}) - 3\\left(\\frac{2}{x \\pm \\sqrt{x^2 - 4}}\\right)\n   \\]\n   \n   - **Simplification Complexity:** This expression becomes quite messy, and I'm starting to think it's not the most efficient path. Perhaps substituting hyperbolic functions was a better choice after all.\n\n#### **Check: Is This Getting Us Anywhere?**\n\nThis approach leads to a complicated expression for \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\), which doesn't immediately suggest a familiar curve type. It also doesn't simplify neatly into the standard form of a conic section like the earlier method did.\n\n### **Final Approach: Stick with the Hyperbolic Substitution**\n\nGiven that the first strategy led us directly to a clear hyperbolic equation and the second strategy complicated things unnecessarily, I'll proceed with the solution from Strategy 1.\n\n### **Final Equation**\n\nFrom Strategy 1, we derived:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{4} - \\frac{y^2}{36} = 1\n\\]\n\nThis is the standard form of a hyperbola.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and checking my work, it's clear that the set of points \\((x, y)\\) plotted according to the given equations lie on a **hyperbola**.\n\n**Final Answer: (E) Hyperbola**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Reflection:** Initially, I thought substituting hyperbolic functions would be straightforward, and it turned out to be the most effective approach.\n  \n- **Mistake Acknowledgment:** The second strategy attempted to express everything in terms of \\( e^t \\) and \\( e^{-t} \\) led to a complex expression, which wasn't necessary since hyperbolic identities simplified the problem effectively.\n\n- **Checking Work:** Throughout the process, I ensured that each substitution and transformation made sense, leading to a clear and recognizable equation.\n\n- **Final Check:** The equation \\(\\frac{x^2}{4} - \\frac{y^2}{36} = 1\\) matches the standard form of a hyperbola, confirming that the original set of points defines a hyperbola.\n\nI hope this step-by-step approach, along with the reflection and checking processes, provides a comprehensive understanding of how to tackle this problem.",
