    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll approach it by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll start:\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the inequality \\(\\frac{x}{x + 3} \\ge 0\\), a few ideas pop into my head:\n\n- **Similar Problems:** It reminds me of solving rational inequalities where the expression is set to be greater than or equal to zero.\n- **Possible Strategies:** I could find the critical points by setting the numerator and denominator to zero, or maybe test intervals around these points to see where the inequality holds.\n- **Concerns:** I'm not entirely sure if testing intervals directly will work smoothly, especially if there are multiple critical points. Maybe I need to consider the behavior at each point carefully.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Find Critical Points:**\n   - Set the numerator \\(x\\) and the denominator \\(x + 3\\) to zero separately to find critical points.\n   - This will help determine where the expression changes sign.\n\n2. **Test Intervals:**\n   - Use these critical points to divide the real number line into intervals.\n   - Pick test points in each interval to see if the inequality holds.\n\n3. **Check for Equality:**\n   - Since the inequality includes \u201cgreater than or equal to,\u201d make sure to include points where the expression equals zero.\n\n4. **Consider Horizontal Asymptotes or Undefined Points:**\n   - Although not strictly necessary for this type of problem, checking for undefined points can ensure that no extraneous solutions are included.\n\n### **Starting with Strategy 1: Finding Critical Points**\n\nLet\u2019s start by finding where the expression is equal to zero or undefined.\n\n**Step 1:** Set the Numerator Equal to Zero\n\n\\[\nx = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This gives me a critical point where the expression equals zero.\n\n**Step 2:** Set the Denominator Equal to Zero\n\n\\[\nx + 3 = 0 \\implies x = -3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This point makes the denominator zero, so the expression is undefined here. It\u2019s important to note because the inequality can\u2019t hold when the denominator is zero.\n\n### **Check After Step 2**\n\n- **Critical Points Identified:** \\(x = 0\\) (zero of numerator) and \\(x = -3\\) (undefined point).\n- **Next Steps:** I need to test intervals around these points to see where the inequality holds.\n\n### **Moving to Strategy 2: Testing Intervals**\n\nNow, let\u2019s divide the number line based on these critical points and test each interval.\n\n**Step 3:** Identify Intervals\n\nThe critical points divide the number line into three intervals:\n\n1. \\((-\\infty, -3)\\)\n2. \\((-3, 0)\\)\n3. \\((0, \\infty)\\)\n\n**Reflection:** I\u2019ll test a point from each interval to see if the inequality \\(\\frac{x}{x + 3} \\ge 0\\) holds.\n\n**Step 4:** Test Point in \\((-\\infty, -3)\\)\n\nChoose \\(x = -4\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-4}{-4 + 3} = \\frac{-4}{-1} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Since \\(4 \\ge 0\\), the inequality holds in this interval.\n\n**Step 5:** Test Point in \\((-3, 0)\\)\n\nChoose \\(x = -1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-1}{-1 + 3} = \\frac{-1}{2} = -0.5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Here, \\(-0.5 < 0\\), so the inequality does not hold in this interval.\n\n**Step 6:** Test Point in \\((0, \\infty)\\)\n\nChoose \\(x = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + 3} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Since \\(0.25 \\ge 0\\), the inequality holds in this interval as well.\n\n### **Check After Step 6**\n\n- **Results:**\n  - \\((-\\infty, -3)\\): Holds\n  - \\((-3, 0)\\): Does Not Hold\n  - \\((0, \\infty)\\): Holds\n\n- **Next Steps:** I need to consider whether the endpoints \\(x = -3\\) and \\(x = 0\\) should be included in the solution.\n\n### **Considering Endpoints**\n\n**Step 7:** Evaluate \\(x = -3\\)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-3}{-3 + 3} = \\frac{-3}{0}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** The expression is undefined at \\(x = -3\\), so this point cannot be included in the solution.\n\n**Step 8:** Evaluate \\(x = 0\\)\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0}{0 + 3} = \\frac{0}{3} = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Since the inequality is \u201cgreater than or equal to,\u201d \\(x = 0\\) is included in the solution.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Endpoints Considered:**\n  - \\(x = -3\\): Undefined, not included.\n  - \\(x = 0\\): Satisfies the inequality, included.\n\n- **Solution Intervals:**\n  - \\((-\\infty, -3)\\): Included\n  - \\((-3, 0)\\): Not included\n  - \\((0, \\infty)\\): Included\n\n### **Final Answer Using Interval Notation**\n\n\\[\n(-\\infty, -3) \\cup [0, \\infty)\n\\]\n\n### **Reflection on the Solution**\n\n- **Approach:** By finding critical points and testing intervals, I was able to determine where the inequality holds.\n- **Verification:** Each step involved checking specific points, ensuring that the solution is accurate.\n- **Confidence:** The method seems solid, and the endpoints were carefully considered to avoid including undefined points.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, testing each interval, and carefully considering the endpoints, I've determined that the solution to the inequality \\(\\frac{x}{x + 3} \\ge 0\\) is \\((-\u221e, -3) \\cup [0, \u221e)\\). Throughout the process, checking and reflecting ensured that each step was correct and led to a valid conclusion.\n\nI hope this detailed step-by-step approach mirrors human problem-solving, with all the messy thinking, checking, and reflecting that comes naturally when tackling such problems!",
