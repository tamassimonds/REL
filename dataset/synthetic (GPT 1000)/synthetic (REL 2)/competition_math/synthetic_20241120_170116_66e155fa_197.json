    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, emulating a natural human thought process with brainstorming, reflections, and checks to ensure we're on the right track. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst Thoughts:  \nThe problem involves writing a digit next to the units digit of the number \\(757\\) to form a four-digit number. We need to determine how many possible digits can be written so that the resulting number is divisible by \\(3\\).\n\nInitial Brainstorming:  \n- **Similar Problems:** This reminds me of problems involving divisibility rules. I recall that for a number to be divisible by \\(3\\), the sum of its digits must be divisible by \\(3\\).\n- **Exploration:** Maybe I can check each possible digit from \\(0\\) to \\(9\\) to see if the total sum of the digits meets the divisibility condition.\n\nThoughts:  \nDoes checking each digit individually make sense? It might be time-consuming but straightforward. Alternatively, I could look for patterns or use modular arithmetic to streamline the process.\n\nDecision:  \nGiven the simplicity of checking each digit and the need to ensure accuracy, I'll start by verifying each possibility. If this approach feels cumbersome, I'll consider switching to a more efficient method.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculating the Sum of Digits**\n\nReflecting:  \nBefore adding new digits, let's determine the sum of the existing digits in \\(757\\).\n\nCalculation:  \n\\[  \n7 + 5 + 7 = 19  \n\\]\n\nCheck:  \n- **Quick Verification:** \\(7 + 5 = 12\\), and \\(12 + 7 = 19\\). This seems correct.\n\nThought Process:  \nNow, I need to see how adding each possible digit (\\(0\\) to \\(9\\)) affects this sum concerning divisibility by \\(3\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Applying the Divisibility Rule for 3**\n\nExploring Strategies:  \n- **Strategy 1:** After adding a new digit, check if the total sum is divisible by \\(3\\).\n- **Strategy 2:** Since \\(19\\) is not divisible by \\(3\\), figure out which digits make the total sum divisible by \\(3\\).\n  \nWait, I remember from the divisibility rule that a number is divisible by \\(3\\) if the sum of its digits is divisible by \\(3\\). So, I need to find digits that, when added to \\(19\\), result in a multiple of \\(3\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Determining Valid Digits**\n\nCalculation:  \n- **Current Sum:** \\(19\\)\n- **Next Possible Sums:** \\(19 + d\\), where \\(d\\) is the digit being added (\\(0\\) to \\(9\\)).\n\nChecking Each Digit:  \n- \\(19 + 0 = 19\\) \u2192 Not divisible by \\(3\\)\n- \\(19 + 1 = 20\\) \u2192 Not divisible by \\(3\\)\n- \\(19 + 2 = 21\\) \u2192 **Divisible by \\(3\\)**\n- \\(19 + 3 = 22\\) \u2192 Not divisible by \\(3\\)\n- \\(19 + 4 = 23\\) \u2192 Not divisible by \\(3\\)\n- \\(19 + 5 = 24\\) \u2192 **Divisible by \\(3\\)**\n- \\(19 + 6 = 25\\) \u2192 Not divisible by \\(3\\)\n- \\(19 + 7 = 26\\) \u2192 Not divisible by \\(3\\)\n- \\(19 + 8 = 27\\) \u2192 **Divisible by \\(3\\)**\n- \\(19 + 9 = 28\\) \u2192 Not divisible by \\(3\\)\n\nReflection:  \nOnly adding digits \\(2\\), \\(5\\), and \\(8\\) makes the total sum divisible by \\(3\\). That gives us three possible digits.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Verifying the Results**\n\nQuick Check:  \n- **Sum with \\(2\\):** \\(19 + 2 = 21\\) \u2192 \\(21 \\div 3 = 7\\) \u2192 Divisible\n- **Sum with \\(5\\):** \\(19 + 5 = 24\\) \u2192 \\(24 \\div 3 = 8\\) \u2192 Divisible\n- **Sum with \\(8\\):** \\(19 + 8 = 27\\) \u2192 \\(27 \\div 3 = 9\\) \u2192 Divisible\n\nThoughts:  \nAll three sums are indeed divisible by \\(3\\). It seems my initial approach was correct.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Considering Alternative Approaches**\n\nReflecting:  \nWas there a more efficient way to determine which digits are valid without checking each one individually?\n\nAlternative Strategy:  \n- **Using Modular Arithmetic:** Since \\(19 \\mod 3 = 1\\), I need to find digits \\(d\\) such that \\((1 + d) \\mod 3 = 0\\).\n- **Possible \\(d\\):** \\(d \\equiv 2 \\mod 3\\) \u2192 This corresponds to digits \\(2\\), \\(5\\), and \\(8\\).\n\nThought Process:  \nThis method aligns with the results from checking each digit individually. It confirms the correctness of the initial approach and provides a more streamlined path.\n\nFinal Check:  \nUsing both methods\u2014checking each digit and applying modular arithmetic\u2014yields the same valid digits. This consistency reinforces the accuracy of the solution.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFinal Answer:  \nThere are **three** possible digits (\\(2\\), \\(5\\), and \\(8\\)) that can be added to \\(757\\) to form a four-digit number divisible by \\(3\\).\n\nReflecting on the Process:  \n- **Brainstorming:** Started by recalling the divisibility rule for \\(3\\).\n- **Initial Approach:** Checked each digit individually to see if the sum is divisible by \\(3\\).\n- **Verification:** Confirmed the validity of the digits through quick checks.\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Considered using modular arithmetic for efficiency, which aligned with the original method's results.\n- **Final Check:** Ensured consistency between both approaches, validating the correctness.\n\nOverall, this step-by-step exploration, including reflections, checks, and alternative strategies, led to a confident and accurate solution.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough aligns with your expectations, showcasing a human-like thought process with all its natural reflections and checks!",
