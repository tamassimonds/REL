    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step-by-step, thinking it through just like I would if I were tackling it in real life. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work regularly, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's see where this takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see that Kit moved **60 feet** closer to the ticket window over **30 minutes**. Now she needs to move the remaining **70 yards** to reach the window. I'm immediately thinking about **unit conversion** and **rate calculations**\u2014something that feels familiar from previous problems.\n\n**Initial Ideas:**\n- Maybe I should convert all measurements to the same unit (like yards or feet) to make the calculations easier.\n- I could calculate Kit's current speed in feet per minute and then use that to determine how long it will take her to cover the remaining distance.\n- Alternatively, perhaps there's a proportionate method I can apply since I know her rate and the remaining distance.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure which strategy will be the most straightforward. Let's explore them.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Unit Conversion Only:**\n   - Convert the remaining 70 yards to feet since Kit's current speed is in feet per minute.\n\n2. **Rate Calculation:**\n   - Calculate Kit's speed in feet per minute.\n   - Use this speed to find out how long it takes to cover the remaining distance.\n\n3. **Proportional Method:**\n   - Since I know the time and distance already covered, perhaps I can set up a proportion to find the time needed for the remaining distance.\n\n**Reflection:**\nConverting yards to feet seems essential because Kit's speed is already given in feet per minute. The proportional method also strikes me as a quick way to check my calculations later. Let's start with unit conversion and rate calculation to see where that leads.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Convert Yards to Feet**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI know 1 yard equals 3 feet. Kit has **70 yards** left, so converting this to feet will align with her speed measurement.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \n70 \\, \\text{yards} \\times 3 \\, \\text{feet/yard} = 210 \\, \\text{feet} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait, that makes sense because yards are larger units, so multiplying by 3 should give me the equivalent in feet.\n\n**Reflection:**\nConversion seems correct. Now I know Kit needs to move **210 feet** to reach the ticket window.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate Kit's Speed in Feet per Minute**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nKit moved **60 feet** in **30 minutes**. To find her speed, I need to divide the distance by the time.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{60 \\, \\text{feet}}{30 \\, \\text{minutes}} = 2 \\, \\text{feet/minute} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because moving 60 feet in 30 minutes means she's averaging 2 feet each minute.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe speed calculation feels right. Now I can use this speed to determine how long it will take her to cover the remaining 210 feet.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate Time Needed to Move 210 Feet at 2 Feet/Minute**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI have Kit's speed\u20142 feet per minute. Now, I need to find the time required to cover 210 feet.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \n\\text{Time} = \\frac{210 \\, \\text{feet}}{2 \\, \\text{feet/minute}} = 105 \\, \\text{minutes} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nLet me double-check this. If she moves 2 feet in a minute, then in 105 minutes, she would cover:\n\\[ \n2 \\, \\text{feet/min} \\times 105 \\, \\text{minutes} = 210 \\, \\text{feet} \n\\]\nThat matches the remaining distance.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis calculation seems correct. Based on her current rate, it will take Kit **105 minutes** to move the remaining 210 feet.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach Using Proportional Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo ensure my calculations are accurate, I can use a proportion to check if the time aligns with the distances covered.\n\n**Calculation:**\nLet's set up a proportion based on the distances and times:\n\\[ \n\\frac{60 \\, \\text{feet}}{30 \\, \\text{minutes}} = \\frac{210 \\, \\text{feet}}{x \\, \\text{minutes}} \n\\]\n\nCross-multiply to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[ \n60x = 30 \\times 210 \n\\]\n\\[ \n60x = 6300 \n\\]\n\\[ \nx = \\frac{6300}{60} \n\\]\n\\[ \nx = 105 \\, \\text{minutes} \n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nSo, by using the proportional method, I also arrived at **105 minutes**. This confirms the validity of the rate calculation.\n\n**Reflection:**\nBoth methods\u2014direct calculation and proportional verification\u2014yield the same result. This consistency adds confidence to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Quick Estimation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, let me do a quick estimation to see if 105 minutes feels reasonable given the distances involved.\n\n**Estimation:**\n- Kit's speed: 2 feet/minute\n- Remaining distance: 210 feet\n- Time at 2 feet/minute should be around 100 minutes, which aligns with the calculated 105 minutes.\n\n**Check:**\nDoes this estimation make sense? Yes, because at her current rate, 100 minutes would be slightly below the mark, and 105 minutes is a reasonable time to cover the extra distance.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe estimation aligns with the calculated time, further validating the correctness of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, performing detailed calculations, and verifying the results using multiple methods, I conclude that it will take Kit **105 minutes** to move the remaining **70 yards** (or **210 feet**) to the ticket window.\n\n---\n\nThroughout this process, I brainstormed various approaches, reflected on each step to ensure correctness, and adjusted my strategy as needed. By checking my work regularly and verifying with different methods, I arrived at a confident and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "She moved 60 feet in 30 minutes, meaning her rate is $\\frac{60}{30} = 2$ feet per minute.  She has $70\\cdot 3 = 210$ feet remaining, meaning she will need $\\frac{210}{2} = \\boxed{105}$ more minutes."
