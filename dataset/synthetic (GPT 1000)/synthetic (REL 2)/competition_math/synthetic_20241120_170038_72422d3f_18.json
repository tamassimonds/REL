Let\u2019s dive in, brainstorm various strategies, reflect often, and check our work as we go along.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\nWhen I first see the problem \\(8! - 7!\\), my immediate thought is that this involves factorials. I recall that factorials are products of all positive integers up to a certain number. Just to be sure, let's quickly recap what factorials are:\n\n- \\(8! = 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\\)\n- \\(7! = 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1\\)\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Option 1:** Compute each factorial separately and then subtract. This seems straightforward but might be cumbersome without a calculator.\n- **Option 2:** Use properties of factorials to simplify the expression before computing. Maybe there's a way to factor out common terms.\n- **Option 3:** Think about the relationship between \\(8!\\) and \\(7!\\). Since \\(8! = 8 \u00d7 7!\\), perhaps that can help simplify things.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n- **Strategy A:** Compute \\(8!\\) and \\(7!\\) directly.\n- **Strategy B:** Use the relationship \\(8! = 8 \u00d7 7!\\) to simplify.\n- **Strategy C:** Factor out \\(7!\\) from the expression.\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, computing both factorials separately seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a more efficient way using Strategy B or C. Let\u2019s try to factor out \\(7!\\) since that might make the calculations easier.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Factor Out \\(7!\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nRealizing that \\(7!\\) is a common factor in both \\(8!\\) and \\(7!\\), I can rewrite the expression to factor it out. This might simplify the subtraction.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \n8! = 8 \u00d7 7! \n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n8! - 7! = (8 \u00d7 7!) - 7! \n\\]\n\n**Factoring Out \\(7!\\):**\n\\[\n8! - 7! = 7! \u00d7 (8 - 1) \n\\]\n\\[\n= 7! \u00d7 7 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis looks promising. By factoring out \\(7!\\), the subtraction becomes much simpler. Now, I just need to compute \\(7!\\) and multiply it by 7.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Compute \\(7!\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI need to find the value of \\(7!\\). Let\u2019s recall what factorial means: it\u2019s the product of all positive integers up to 7.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n7! = 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 \n\\]\nLet\u2019s calculate it step by step:\n- \\(7 \u00d7 6 = 42\\)\n- \\(42 \u00d7 5 = 210\\)\n- \\(210 \u00d7 4 = 840\\)\n- \\(840 \u00d7 3 = 2,520\\)\n- \\(2,520 \u00d7 2 = 5,040\\)\n- \\(5,040 \u00d7 1 = 5,040\\)\n\nSo, \\(7! = 5,040\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nAlright, \\(7! = 5,040\\). That seems reasonable. Let me quickly check the multiplication steps to ensure there are no mistakes. Yes, all multiplications check out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Multiply \\(7!\\) by 7**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I know \\(7! = 5,040\\), I can multiply it by 7 to find the value of \\(8! - 7!\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n8! - 7! = 7! \u00d7 7 = 5,040 \u00d7 7 \n\\]\nLet\u2019s do the multiplication:\n- \\(5,040 \u00d7 7 = 35,280\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, \\(5,040 \u00d7 7 = 35,280\\). This multiplication also seems correct. Let me think for a moment\u2014does this result make sense in the context of the problem?\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Does \\(8! - 7!\\) equal \\(7! \u00d7 7\\)?** Yes, because \\(8! = 8 \u00d7 7!\\), so subtracting \\(7!\\) leaves \\(7! \u00d7 7\\).\n- **Is the multiplication correct?** \\(5,040 \u00d7 7 = 35,280\\) checks out.\n\nEverything seems to be in order.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter factoring out \\(7!\\) and computing the necessary multiplications, the result is:\n\n\\[\n8! - 7! = 35,280\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nBy recognizing the common factor \\(7!\\) in both terms, I simplified the problem significantly. This method not only made the calculations easier but also ensured accuracy by reducing the number of multiplications needed. Always good to look for such simplifications when dealing with factorials!\n\n---\n\n### **Takeaways**\n\n- **Factoring Out Common Terms:** This approach can simplify expressions involving factorials, making calculations more manageable.\n- **Checking Each Step:** Regularly reflecting and verifying calculations helps catch mistakes early.\n- **Exploring Multiple Strategies:** Even when one method seems straightforward, considering alternatives can lead to more efficient solutions.\n\nOverall, thinking through the problem carefully and being open to adjusting strategies led to a straightforward and correct solution.\n\nAhh, I see I've made a mistake in my initial approach. Let\u2019s revisit the problem and correct it by brainstorming different strategies and reflecting on where I went wrong.\n\n---\n\n### **Revisiting the Problem**\n\n**User Query:**\nCompute without using a calculator: \\(8! - 7!\\)\n\n**Initial Mistake Recap:**\nIn my previous attempt, I factored out \\(7!\\) correctly, but I didn't fully verify the multiplication step, leading to an incorrect final answer. Specifically, I computed \\(5,040 \u00d7 7\\) as \\(35,280\\), which is incorrect. Let me dive deeper to pinpoint and fix this error.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Again**\n\n**Reflecting on the Previous Approach:**\n- I factored out \\(7!\\) from the expression, which was a good start.\n- However, the multiplication step was incorrect. \\(5,040 \u00d7 7\\) should multiply to \\(35,280\\), but let's double-check this multiplication manually to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Exploring Alternative Strategies:**\n- **Option 1:** Recompute \\(7! \u00d7 7\\) carefully to verify the correct multiplication result.\n- **Option 2:** Compute \\(8!\\) and \\(7!\\) separately without factoring to cross-check the initial result.\n- **Option 3:** Use the property \\(8! = 8 \u00d7 7!\\) to simplify and then verify the multiplication step.\n\n**Waiting for Insights:**\nRealizing that I need to ensure the multiplication is correct, I think it might be helpful to verify \\(5,040 \u00d7 7\\) manually or choose another method to confirm the result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Recomputing \\(7! \u00d7 7\\) Correctly**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI need to ensure that multiplying \\(5,040\\) by \\(7\\) gives the correct result. Let's break down the multiplication step carefully.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n5,040 \u00d7 7 = 5,040 \u00d7 (7 \u00d7 1) = 5,040 \u00d7 7 + 5,040 \u00d7 0\n\\]\nBut let's simplify it differently for clarity:\n\n\\[\n5,040 \u00d7 7 = 5,040 \u00d7 (5 + 2 + 0.5) = \n\\]\n\\[\n5,040 \u00d7 5 = 25,200\n\\]\n\\[\n5,040 \u00d7 2 = 10,080\n\\]\n\\[\n5,040 \u00d7 0.5 = 2,520\n\\]\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n25,200 + 10,080 + 2,520 = 37,800\n\\]\n\n**Revision:**\nWait, \\(5,040 \u00d7 7 = 35,280\\) was correct, but my previous calculation led to \\(37,800\\). This discrepancy indicates a miscalculation in the breakdown. Let's re-add carefully:\n\n\\[\n25,200 + 10,080 + 2,520 = 37,800\n\\]\nBut reflecting on this, the correct addition should be:\n\\[\n25,200 + 10,080 = 35,280\n\\]\n\\[\n35,280 + 2,520 = 37,800\n\\]\nAhh, I realize that my initial breakdown was flawed. The correct multiplication should indeed be:\n\\[\n5,040 \u00d7 7 = 35,280\n\\]\nI made an error in dividing \\(5,040\\) by \\(0.5\\), which is unnecessary.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis correction aligns with the earlier incorrect result. Let's proceed with \\(35,280\\) being the correct answer, ensuring that \\(5,040 \u00d7 7\\) indeed multiplies to \\(35,280\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- **Does \\(8! - 7!\\) equal \\(7! \u00d7 7\\)?** Yes, because \\(8! = 7! \u00d7 8\\), so subtracting \\(7!\\) leaves \\(7! \u00d7 (8 - 1) = 7! \u00d7 7\\).\n- **Is the multiplication now correct?** \\(5,040 \u00d7 7 = 35,280\\) checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying by Computing \\(8!\\) and \\(7!\\) Separately**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nTo double-check, let's compute \\(8!\\) and \\(7!\\) separately and then subtract \\(7!\\) from \\(8!\\) to see if it matches \\(7! \u00d7 7\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n8! = 8 \u00d7 7! = 8 \u00d7 5,040 = 40,320\n\\]\n\\[\n7! = 5,040\n\\]\n\\[\n8! - 7! = 40,320 - 5,040 = 35,280\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis gives the same result, \\(35,280\\), confirming that factoring out \\(7!\\) and multiplying by \\(7\\) was correct. The earlier multiplication error didn't affect the final outcome because the error was caught and corrected.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter revisiting and correcting the multiplication step, the correct result is:\n\n\\[\n8! - 7! = 35,280\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nBy factoring out \\(7!\\) and ensuring accurate multiplication, the solution is consistent. It's crucial to verify each step, especially multiplications, to avoid small errors that can lead to incorrect results.\n\n**Takeaways:**\n- **Factoring Out Common Terms:** Simplifies factorial expressions significantly.\n- **Importance of Checking Work:** Catching and correcting multiplication errors ensures accuracy.\n- **Cross-Verification:** Computing both \\(8!\\) and \\(7!\\) separately validates the factored approach.\n\nAlways good to reflect and ensure each step aligns with expectations. This methodical approach guarantees a reliable and correct solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Thoughts**\n\n**Checking for Alternative Methods:**\nI briefly considered whether there might be another way to simplify \\(8! - 7!\\), but factoring out \\(7!\\) seemed the most straightforward and efficient. Alternative methods would likely lead back to this approach, reinforcing its validity.\n\n**Potential for Mistakes:**\nMultiplication errors are common, especially when breaking down large numbers. It's essential to approach each calculation step carefully, perhaps verifying smaller parts before adding them up.\n\n**Final Assurance:**\nWith multiple strategies confirming the same result and careful reflection ensuring accuracy, I'm confident that \\(8! - 7! = 35,280\\).\n\nInnovative thinking is crucial in problem-solving, enabling us to explore different strategies, learn from mistakes, and adapt our approach to ensure the correct solution.",
