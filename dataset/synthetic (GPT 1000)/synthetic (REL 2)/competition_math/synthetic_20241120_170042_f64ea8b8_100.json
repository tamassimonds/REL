    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking it through as naturally as possible. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check if I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9! \\cdot 5! \\cdot 2!}{8! \\cdot 6!}\n\\]\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a combinatorial or factorial simplification problem. I've dealt with factorials before, so it reminds me of simplifying fractions with factorials to cancel out terms.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Cancel Factorials:** Simplify by canceling out common factorials in the numerator and denominator.\n  2. **Expand Factorials Completely:** Write out all factorials to see if there's a pattern or simplification.\n  3. **Use Properties of Factorials:** Maybe leverage \\( n! = n \\times (n-1)! \\) to simplify step by step.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** At first, I'm not sure which method will be the most efficient. Canceling seems promising, but I might need to expand if that doesn't work out.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Canceling Factorials**\n\n**Step 1:** Look for Common Factorials\n\n- **Thought Process:** Let's see if there are factorials that can cancel out right away. Both the numerator and denominator have factorials, so maybe there's a straightforward cancellation.\n\n- **Performing the Cancellation:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9! \\cdot 5! \\cdot 2!}{8! \\cdot 6!}\n\\]\n\nI notice that \\( 9! \\) and \\( 8! \\) are consecutive factorials, which means:\n\n\\[\n9! = 9 \\times 8!\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9 \\times 8! \\cdot 5! \\cdot 2!}{8! \\cdot 6!}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Cancel \\( 8! \\) from Numerator and Denominator\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9 \\times \\cancel{8!} \\cdot 5! \\cdot 2!}{\\cancel{8!} \\cdot 6!} = \\frac{9 \\times 5! \\times 2!}{6!}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Looks good so far. Cancelling \\( 8! \\) simplifies the expression significantly.\n- **Next Move:** Now, I need to see if I can simplify \\( 5! / 6! \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying \\( \\frac{5!}{6!} \\)**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Wait a minute, I know that \\( 6! = 6 \\times 5! \\). So, \\( \\frac{5!}{6!} \\) can be simplified further.\n\n- **Simplification:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5!}{6!} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Substitute Back into the Expression\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9 \\times 5! \\times 2!}{6!} = 9 \\times \\frac{5!}{6!} \\times 2! = 9 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times 2!\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Multiplying by \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) and then by \\( 2! \\) seems correct. Let me calculate \\( 2! \\).\n- **Calculation:** \\( 2! = 2 \\), so the expression becomes \\( 9 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times 2 = \\frac{18}{6} = 3 \\).\n\n**Step 5:** Final Calculation\n\n\\[\n9 \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times 2 = \\frac{9 \\times 2}{6} = \\frac{18}{6} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Solution**\n\n- **Question:** Does the answer make sense?\n- **Reflection:** Simplifying factorials step by step and checking each cancellation feels correct. The final answer, 3, seems reasonable given the initial expression.\n- **Possible Mistakes:** I briefly considered whether I missed any cancellations, but checking each step ensures everything is accounted for.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Expanding Factorials Completely**\n\n**Step 6:** Reconsidering the Approach\n\n- **Thought Process:** Even though canceling factorials worked well, perhaps expanding them completely could provide a different perspective or verify the correctness.\n\n- **Expanding the Expression:**\n\n\\[\n9! = 362880, \\quad 5! = 120, \\quad 2! = 2, \\quad 8! = 40320, \\quad 6! = 720\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{362880 \\times 120 \\times 2}{40320 \\times 720}\n\\]\n\n**Step 7:** Calculating Numerator and Denominator Separately\n\n\\[\n\\text{Numerator: } 362880 \\times 120 \\times 2 = 87091200\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Denominator: } 40320 \\times 720 = 29030400\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{87091200}{29030400} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check:** Expanding and calculating directly also gives 3, confirming that the earlier approach was correct.\n- **Insight:** Sometimes, expanding factorials can serve as a cross-check, ensuring that simplifications didn't overlook any details.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8:** Comparing Both Strategies\n\n- **Observation:** Both methods\u2014canceling factorials and expanding them entirely\u2014lead to the same final answer.\n- **Conclusion:** Canceling factorials was more straightforward and efficient, while expanding served as a validation step.\n- **Learning:** It's often beneficial to have multiple strategies; the simpler one saves time, and the alternative confirms correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Final Strategy:** The initial approach of canceling factorials was the most efficient. Expanding factorials confirmed the correctness of the simplification.\n- **Reflection:** I explored different methods, reflected on each step, and verified the final answer. This step-by-step checking ensured accuracy.\n- **Key Takeaway:** Always consider multiple strategies to find the most efficient path, but don't hesitate to verify with an alternative method when uncertain.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]",
