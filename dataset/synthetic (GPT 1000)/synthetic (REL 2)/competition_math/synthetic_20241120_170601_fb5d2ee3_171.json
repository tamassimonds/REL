    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my approach frequently, and check my work as I go to ensure everything makes sense. Let's emulate a human thought process, complete with initial uncertainties, exploring various methods, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem, I see a table with two stores offering different discounts on Camera $X$. The goal is to determine how much cheaper the cheaper store's price is compared to the more expensive store, measured in cents.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- **Discounts Involved:** One store offers a fixed dollar amount off, and the other offers a percentage discount.\n- **List Price Provided:** Both discounts are based on the same list price ($39.96).\n- **Comparison Needed:** I need to compare the final prices at both stores to find the difference.\n\nThis reminds me of problems where you have to compare final prices after different types of discounts. I've tackled similar problems before, so I think I can apply some of those strategies here. But let's brainstorm to see the best approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate Final Prices Directly:**\n   - Compute the final price for both stores by applying their respective discounts to the list price.\n   \n2. **Express Discounts as Cents:**\n   - Since the answer needs to be in cents, convert both the dollar amount and percentage discounts into cents to see which is cheaper.\n\n3. **Compare Discounts First:**\n   - Before calculating the final prices, compare the total discounts in cents to see which store offers a better deal.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Direct Calculation:** Seems straightforward, but I should be careful with converting currencies (dollars to cents).\n- **Expressing Discounts in Cents:** This might simplify the comparison, making it easier to see which store is cheaper before doing the full calculations.\n- **Comparing Discounts First:** Could save time by identifying the cheaper option early on.\n\nI think starting with **expressing the discounts in cents** and then moving to **calculating final prices** would be a good combination. This way, I can confirm my approach works by comparing both methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Expressing Discounts in Cents**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's convert both the fixed dollar discount and the percentage discount into cents to see how they compare directly.\n\n- **Super Savers:** \\$9 off\n- **Penny Wise:** 25% off\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Convert Fixed Dollar Discount to Cents:**\n   - \\$9 = 9 x 100 = **900 cents**\n\n2. **Convert Percentage Discount to Cents:**\n   - List Price = \\$39.96 = 39.96 x 100 = **3996 cents**\n   - 25% of 3996 cents = 0.25 x 3996 = **999 cents**\n\n**Wait a Moment...**\nHmm, the percentage discount converts to 999 cents, which is more than the fixed dollar discount of 900 cents. This suggests that the percentage discount is more beneficial. But I should double-check by calculating the final prices to confirm.\n\n**Reflection:**\nConverting discounts to cents makes it clear that the 25% discount is more than the fixed \\$9 discount. This implies that **Penny Wise** likely has the cheaper price, but let's proceed to calculate the final prices to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating Final Prices**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, let's apply both discounts to the list price to find the final prices at each store.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Super Savers:**\n   - List Price: \\$39.96\n   - Discount: \\$9 off\n   - Final Price = \\$39.96 - \\$9 = **\\$30.96**\n\n2. **Penny Wise:**\n   - List Price: \\$39.96\n   - Discount: 25% off\n   - Percentage Discount in Dollars = \\$39.96 x 0.25 = **\\$9.99**\n   - Final Price = \\$39.96 - \\$9.99 = **\\$29.97**\n\n**Quick Check:**\nWait, the final price at **Penny Wise** is **\\$29.97**, which is less than \\$30.96 at **Super Savers**. This aligns with our earlier observation that the percentage discount is more substantial.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe calculations confirm that **Penny Wise** offers the cheaper price after applying the percentage discount. It's always good to double-check these steps to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Price Difference in Cents**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSince the problem asks for the difference in cents, I'll convert the final price difference into cents to get the answer.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Difference in Final Prices:**\n   - \\$30.96 (Super Savers) - \\$29.97 (Penny Wise) = **\\$0.99**\n\n2. **Convert to Cents:**\n   - \\$0.99 x 100 = **99 cents**\n\n**Final Check:**\nIs the difference of 99 cents reasonable? Given that the percentage discount was higher, it makes sense that **Penny Wise** is 99 cents cheaper.\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The step-by-step approach, starting from comparing discounts in cents to calculating and confirming final prices, led to a consistent and logical conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully comparing the discounts and calculating the final prices at both stores, we determined that **Penny Wise** is **99 cents** cheaper than **Super Savers** for Camera $X$.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- Converting discounts to a common unit (cents) helps in making direct comparisons.\n- Calculating final prices accurately confirms which store offers the better deal.\n- Reflecting and checking each step ensures the correctness of the final answer.\n\nThis detailed, step-by-step approach not only provided the correct answer but also mirrored a human thought process with brainstorming, reflections, and constant checking along the way.",
