    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies and exploring what's going on, similar to how I would tackle it naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, the question asks me to find a quadratic function \\( f(x) = x^2 + ax + b \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f(f(x) + x)}{f(x)} = x^2 + 1776x + 2010\n\\]\n\nMy initial reaction is to **decompose the given equation** and see if I can relate the parts. Quadratics often involve **completing the square**, **factoring**, or maybe setting up **polynomial identities**.\n\nBut honestly, this looks a bit messy. The fraction involving \\( f(f(x) + x) \\) suggests that perhaps **substituting variables** or simplifying the numerator might help. \n\nAnother idea is to **set up equations** by expanding both sides and equating coefficients since both sides are polynomials. This is a common method to find parameters in polynomial equations.\n\nI\u2019ll need to be flexible and ready to pivot if one approach doesn\u2019t seem to work. Let's start by **exploring the substitution route** to see if it leads anywhere.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring Substitution**\n\n **Brainstorming**: What happens if I substitute \\( f(x) + x \\) into \\( f \\)? \n\nLet\u2019s denote \\( g(x) = f(x) + x \\). So, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f(g(x))}{f(x)} = x^2 + 1776x + 2010\n\\]\n\nHmm, this substitution might simplify things if I can express \\( f(g(x)) \\) in terms of \\( f(x) \\). But looking at it, I realize I need to know more about \\( f(g(x)) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) to proceed effectively.\n\n**Reflection**: This substitution doesn\u2019t immediately simplify the problem. I still need to know \\( f(g(x)) \\) in terms of \\( f(x) \\), which isn\u2019t straightforward. Maybe there\u2019s a better path.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Reverting to Original Function Definition**\n\n **Thinking**: Let's go back to the original function definition and see if expanding both sides helps.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + ax + b\n\\]\n\nFirst, compute \\( f(x) + x \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x) + x = x^2 + ax + b + x = x^2 + (a + 1)x + b\n\\]\n\nNow, find \\( f(f(x) + x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(f(x) + x) = f(x^2 + (a + 1)x + b)\n\\]\n\nTo compute this, we need to substitute \\( f(x) + x \\) into the original function.\n\n**Self-Check**: Wait, do I know how to expand \\( f \\) when its argument is another polynomial? Typically, I need to replace \\( x \\) in \\( f(x) \\) with the entire expression \\( g(x) \\).\n\nThis seems like it might get complicated. Perhaps expanding directly isn\u2019t the best first step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Equating Coefficients**\n\n **Realization**: Maybe instead of expanding completely, equating coefficients after clearing the fraction could work.\n\nLet's rewrite the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f(f(x) + x)}{f(x)} = x^2 + 1776x + 2010\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( f(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(f(x) + x) = (x^2 + 1776x + 2010) f(x)\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( f(x) \\) into the left side:\n\n\\[\nf(x^2 + (a + 1)x + b) = (x^2 + 1776x + 2010)(x^2 + ax + b)\n\\]\n\nThis looks more manageable. The left side is a polynomial in terms of \\( x \\), and the right side is the product of two quadratics.\n\n**Reflection**: To equate coefficients, I need to expand both sides and match terms of equal degree. This might require a lot of work, but it seems like a solid approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Expanding the Right Side**\n\n **Decision**: Let\u2019s start by expanding the right-hand side to see what we're dealing with.\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + 1776x + 2010)\n\\]\n\nUsing distributive property (FOIL):\n\n1. **First:** \\( x^2 \\times x^2 = x^4 \\)\n2. **Outer:** \\( x^2 \\times 1776x = 1776x^3 \\)\n3. **Inner:** \\( ax \\times x^2 = ax^3 \\)\n4. **Last:** \\( ax \\times 1776x = 1776ax^2 \\)\n5. **And so on with \\( b \\times \\) terms...**\n\nCollecting like terms:\n\n\\[\nx^4 + (1776 + a)x^3 + (2010 + 1776a + b)x^2 + (2010a + 1776b)x + 2010b\n\\]\n\n**Self-Check**: Does this look correct? I should ensure I\u2019ve added coefficients properly, especially with multiple terms contributing to each power of \\( x \\).\n\n**Mental Check**: Each term seems to include contributions from both polynomials, so this looks right for now.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Preparing to Expand the Left Side**\n\n **Now**, let\u2019s expand the left side:\n\n\\[\nf(f(x) + x) = f(x^2 + (a + 1)x + b)\n\\]\n\nBut wait, expanding \\( f \\) requires substituting \\( x^2 + (a + 1)x + b \\) into \\( f(x) \\), which means replacing \\( x \\) in \\( f(x) = x^2 + ax + b \\) with \\( x^2 + (a + 1)x + b \\).\n\n**Reflection**: This looks like a two-step substitution. I need to be careful here to avoid mistakes. Maybe writing it out step by step will help.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Performing the Substitution**\n\n **Thinking**: Let\u2019s perform the substitution carefully.\n\nDefine \\( u = x^2 + (a + 1)x + b \\).\n\nNow, compute \\( f(u) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(u) = u^2 + au + b\n\\]\n\nFirst, find \\( u^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nu^2 = (x^2 + (a + 1)x + b)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= x^4 + 2(a + 1)x^3 + ((a + 1)^2 + 2b)x^2 + 2b(a + 1)x + b^2\n\\]\n\n**Self-Check**: Is the expansion correct? Each term should reflect squaring a trinomial.\n\n**Mental Check**: When squaring, ensure the coefficients of \\( x^3 \\), \\( x^2 \\), etc., are accurate.\n\n**Reflection**: This expansion seems correct. Now, substitute back into \\( f(u) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(u) = (x^4 + 2(a + 1)x^3 + ((a + 1)^2 + 2b)x^2 + 2b(a + 1)x + b^2) + a(x^2 + (a + 1)x + b) + b\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\nf(u) = x^4 + (2(a + 1) + a)x^3 + ((a + 1)^2 + 2b + a)x^2 + (2b(a + 1) + a \\cdot (a + 1))x + (b^2 + b + ab)\n\\]\n\nSimplify coefficients:\n\n- **Cubic Term:** \\( 2(a + 1) + a = 3a + 2 \\)\n- **Quadratic Term:** \\( (a + 1)^2 + 2b + a = a^2 + 3a + 1 + 2b \\)\n- **Linear Term:** Combine terms carefully.\n- **Constant Term:** \\( b^2 + b + ab \\)\n\n**Reflection**: This looks a bit messy, especially the linear term. Let\u2019s leave it for now and come back to it later.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Equating Both Sides**\n\n **Thinking**: Now that both sides are expanded, let's equate coefficients.\n\nLeft Side:\n\n\\[\nf(f(x) + x) = x^4 + (3a + 2)x^3 + \\text{(messy quadratic term)} + \\text{(linear term)} + (b^2 + b + ab)\n\\]\n\nRight Side:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + 1776x + 2010)(x^2 + ax + b) = x^4 + (1776 + a)x^3 + (2010 + 1776a + b)x^2 + (2010a + 1776b)x + 2010b\n\\]\n\n**Setting Up the Equations**:\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   1 = 1 \\quad \\text{(Already matches)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   3a + 2 = 1776 + a\n   \\]\n\n3. **Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   a^2 + 3a + 1 + 2b = 2010 + 1776a + b\n   \\]\n\n4. **Coefficient of \\( x \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{(Messy expression)} = 2010a + 1776b\n   \\]\n\n5. **Constant Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   b^2 + b + ab = 2010b\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection**: To simplify, let's tackle these equations one by one, starting with the simplest.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Solving the Constant Term Equation**\n\n **Looking at**:\n\n\\[\nb^2 + b + ab = 2010b\n\\]\n\nRearrange:\n\n\\[\nb^2 + ab + b - 2010b = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nb^2 + ab - 2009b = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nb(b + a - 2009) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Solutions**:\n\n1. **\\( b = 0 \\)**\n2. **\\( b + a - 2009 = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( a = 2009 - b \\)**\n\n**Reflection**: This gives me two cases to consider. Let\u2019s keep both in mind and see which one fits better as we progress.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Solving the \\( x^3 \\) Coefficient Equation**\n\n **Looking at**:\n\n\\[\n3a + 2 = 1776 + a\n\\]\n\nRearrange:\n\n\\[\n3a - a = 1776 + 2\n\\]\n\\[\n2a = 1778\n\\]\n\\[\na = 889\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: This suggests \\( a = 889 \\). Now, according to our constant term equation, \\( a = 2009 - b \\). Let\u2019s see if \\( b = 0 \\) or \\( b \\) needs to be adjusted.\n\n**Quick Check**:\n\nIf \\( b = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\na = 2009 - 0 = 2009\n\\]\n\nBut our earlier calculation gives \\( a = 889 \\). There\u2019s a mismatch. This implies **either \\( b \\neq 0 \\)** or **another approach is needed**.\n\n**Realization**: Since \\( b = 0 \\) leads to inconsistency, perhaps \\( a = 889 \\) and \\( b = 2009 - 889 = 1120 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Verifying the \\( x^2 \\) Coefficient Equation**\n\n **Given**:\n\n\\[\na^2 + 3a + 1 + 2b = 2010 + 1776a + b\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( a = 889 \\) and \\( b = 1120 \\):\n\n\\[\n(889)^2 + 3(889) + 1 + 2(1120) = 2010 + 1776(889) + 1120\n\\]\n\nCalculating both sides:\n\n**Left Side**:\n\n\\[\n789721 + 2667 + 1 + 2240 = 792629\n\\]\n\n**Right Side**:\n\n\\[\n2010 + 1571856 + 1120 = 1574936\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: Wait a minute, there\u2019s a **huge discrepancy** between both sides. This suggests **either a calculation error** or that \\( a = 889 \\) and \\( b = 1120 \\) are **incorrect**.\n\n**Check**: Let me quickly verify the calculations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 11: Rechecking Calculations**\n\n **Left Side**:\n\n\\[\n889^2 = 789721\n\\]\n\\[\n3 \\times 889 = 2667\n\\]\n\\[\n2 \\times 1120 = 2240\n\\]\n\\[\n789721 + 2667 + 1 + 2240 = 792629\n\\]\n\n **Right Side**:\n\n\\[\n1776 \\times 889 = 1571856\n\\]\n\\[\n2010 + 1571856 + 1120 = 1574936\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: The calculations are correct. The left side is **much smaller** than the right side, indicating that there\u2019s an issue with the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) chosen.\n\n**Realization**: **Perhaps \\( b \\neq 0 \\)**, which means I should reconsider the constant term equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 12: Revisiting the Constant Term Equation**\n\n **Original Equation**:\n\n\\[\nb(b + a - 2009) = 0\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( a = 889 \\):\n\n\\[\nb + 889 - 2009 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = 2009 - 889 = 1120\n\\]\n\nBut substituting \\( a = 889 \\) and \\( b = 1120 \\) into the \\( x^2 \\) coefficient equation led to inconsistency.\n\n**Reflection**: This suggests that **neither \\( a = 889 \\) nor \\( b = 1120 \\)** fit the equations simultaneously. Perhaps I need to **rethink my approach**.\n\n**Possible Mistake**: Maybe assuming \\( a = 889 \\) and \\( b = 1120 \\) based on the \\( x^3 \\) equation led to an incorrect solution because of the larger picture involving all coefficients.\n\n**Reconsideration**: Instead of fixing \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) immediately, **consider solving the system of equations** step by step, starting from the simplest.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 13: Reapproaching the Constant Term Equation**\n\n **Given**:\n\n\\[\nb(b + a - 2009) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives two cases:\n\n1. **\\( b = 0 \\)**\n2. **\\( b + a - 2009 = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( a = 2009 - b \\)**\n\nLet's revisit these cases considering that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must satisfy all coefficient equations.\n\n**Case 1: \\( b = 0 \\)**\n\nFrom the constant term:\n\n\\[\n0(a - 2009) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is always true, so \\( b = 0 \\) could be a valid solution, but let's see if it fits other equations.\n\nNow, substitute \\( b = 0 \\) into the \\( x^3 \\) coefficient equation:\n\n\\[\n3a + 2 = 1776 + a\n\\]\n\\[\n2a = 1774\n\\]\n\\[\na = 887\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: Let's check if \\( a = 887 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\) satisfy all equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 14: Verifying \\( a = 887 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\)**\n\n **Checking the \\( x^2 \\) Coefficient Equation**:\n\n\\[\na^2 + 3a + 1 + 2b = 2010 + 1776a + b\n\\]\n\nWith \\( a = 887 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n(887)^2 + 3(887) + 1 + 2(0) = 2010 + 1776(887) + 0\n\\]\n\nCalculating both sides:\n\n**Left Side**:\n\n\\[\n789769 + 2661 + 1 + 0 = 792431\n\\]\n\n**Right Side**:\n\n\\[\n2010 + 1571508 + 0 = 1573518\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: There's still a **large discrepancy** between the two sides. This indicates that \\( a = 887 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\) **do not** satisfy the \\( x^2 \\) coefficient equation.\n\n**Conclusion**: **Neither \\( a = 889 \\), \\( b = 1120 \\) nor \\( a = 887 \\), \\( b = 0 \\)** satisfy all the coefficient equations simultaneously.\n\n**Realization**: **This suggests that there might be an error in the initial approach** or that perhaps nested substitutions lead to overly complicated expressions that don't simplify neatly.\n\n**Possible Strategy Change**: Instead of expanding everything, perhaps consider **simplifying the original equation differently**, like assuming particular values for coefficients or looking for patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 15: Looking for Patterns or Simplifications**\n\n **Brainstorming**: Perhaps the coefficients need to satisfy certain conditions that can be derived without fully expanding everything.\n\nGiven the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f(f(x) + x)}{f(x)} = x^2 + 1776x + 2010\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that the **ratio of polynomials** equals another polynomial, meaning **division should yield a quotient without remainder**, assuming \\( f(f(x) + x) \\) is a multiple of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**Considering**: Maybe \\( f(x) \\) is structured such that when composed and divided by itself, it leaves a specific quadratic polynomial.\n\n**Possible Insight**: Perhaps \\( f(x) \\) has roots or specific values that simplify the equation significantly. \n\n**Alternative Approach**: **Assume specific values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)** that might simplify the equation to see if a pattern emerges, but be aware that this is more trial-and-error than a systematic approach.\n\n**Reflection**: This might lead to a solution, but it risks missing other potential solutions or introducing unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Decision**: **Stick with the earlier approach**, perhaps looking for simplifications within the expansion process.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 16: Revisiting the Expansion Process**\n\n **Looking back**: In Step 6, performing the substitution led to a messy expression. Maybe simplifying \\( f(f(x) + x) \\) differently could help.\n\nLet\u2019s reconsider how to compute \\( f(f(x) + x) \\).\n\nGiven \\( f(x) + x = x^2 + (a + 1)x + b \\), perhaps **substituting back carefully** without rushing could yield a cleaner expression.\n\nLet\u2019s attempt to expand \\( f(f(x) + x) \\) step by step.\n\n**Define**:\n\n\\[\nu = f(x) + x = x^2 + (a + 1)x + b\n\\]\n\nNow, find \\( f(u) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(u) = u^2 + au + b\n\\]\n\nCompute \\( u^2 \\) first:\n\n\\[\nu^2 = (x^2 + (a + 1)x + b)^2\n= x^4 + 2(a + 1)x^3 + ((a + 1)^2 + 2b)x^2 + 2(a + 1)bx + b^2\n\\]\n\nNow, add \\( au \\):\n\n\\[\nau = a(x^2 + (a + 1)x + b) = ax^2 + a(a + 1)x + ab\n\\]\n\nFinally, add \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\nf(u) = x^4 + 2(a + 1)x^3 + ((a + 1)^2 + 2b)x^2 + 2(a + 1)bx + b^2 + ax^2 + a(a + 1)x + ab + b\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\nf(u) = x^4 + [2(a + 1)]x^3 + [(a + 1)^2 + 2b + a]x^2 + [2(a + 1)b + a(a + 1)]x + [b^2 + ab + b]\n\\]\n\nSimplify coefficients:\n\n- **Cubic Term Coefficient:** \\( 2(a + 1) \\)\n- **Quadratic Term Coefficient:** \\( (a + 1)^2 + 2b + a = a^2 + 3a + 1 + 2b \\)\n- **Linear Term Simplification Needed:** \\( 2(a + 1)b + a(a + 1) \\)\n- **Constant Term Simplification Needed:** \\( b^2 + ab + b \\)\n\n**Reflection**: The cubic term simplifies neatly, but the quadratic and higher terms are still messy. Perhaps this isn\u2019t leading us directly towards the solution.\n\n**Possible Insight**: Maybe explicit coefficients aren\u2019t necessary, and there\u2019s a deeper relationship between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) that simplifies the equation more naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 17: Considering \\( f(x) \\) as a Monic Polynomial**\n\n **Brainstorming**: What if \\( f(x) \\) is monic, meaning the leading coefficient is 1? This could simplify the problem since quadratics are typically monic in such contexts.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + ax + b\n\\]\n\nThe leading coefficient is already 1, but maybe **assuming specific values** for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) could help.\n\n**Idea**: Perhaps \\( f(x) \\) has roots that simplify the composition, or maybe there\u2019s a relationship between the roots of \\( f(x) \\) and the quadratic on the right side.\n\n**Alternative Approach**: **Test specific values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)** to see if they satisfy all equations, but be cautious since this might miss general solutions.\n\n**Reflection**: This trial-and-error approach could lead to a solution, but it\u2019s time-consuming and might not be the most efficient.\n\n**Decision**: **Reassess the previous steps** and see if sticking with the coefficient matching approach is still viable.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 18: Reassessing the Coefficient Matching Approach**\n\n **Self-Check**: Given that \\( a = 889 \\) and \\( b = 1120 \\) led to inconsistencies, perhaps revisiting how these values were derived is necessary.\n\n**Revisiting the Constant Term Equation**:\n\n\\[\nb(b + a - 2009) = 0\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( a = 889 \\):\n\n\\[\nb + 889 - 2009 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = 2009 - 889 = 1120\n\\]\n\n**Reminder**: Substituting \\( a = 889 \\) and \\( b = 1120 \\) led to inconsistency in the \\( x^2 \\) coefficient equation.\n\n**Reflection**: **This suggests that there\u2019s an inconsistency in assuming \\( a = 889 \\) and \\( b = 1120 \\), meaning another approach or correction is needed.**\n\n**Possible Mistake**: Perhaps the coefficient \\( x^3 \\) equation was misinterpreted or solved incorrectly.\n\n**Reconsideration**: **Re-examine the \\( x^3 \\) coefficient equation** to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 19: Re-examining the \\( x^3 \\) Coefficient Equation**\n\n **Given**:\n\n\\[\n3a + 2 = 1776 + a\n\\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[\n3a - a = 1776 + 2\n\\]\n\\[\n2a = 1778\n\\]\n\\[\na = 889\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: This consistently leads to \\( a = 889 \\). Given the constant term equation:\n\n\\[\nb = 2009 - a = 2009 - 889 = 1120\n\\]\n\nBut substituting \\( a = 889 \\) and \\( b = 1120 \\) into the \\( x^2 \\) equation led to inconsistency. This suggests that **perhaps there's an error in how the equations were set up** or that **additional conditions are missing.**\n\n**Possible Insight**: **Maybe the problem has constraints or insights that haven\u2019t been fully explored, leading to miscalculations.**\n\n**Next Step**: **Consider looking for additional relationships between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)** or check if there are specific assumptions that can be made about \\( f(x) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 20: Exploring Additional Relationships**\n\n **Alternative Insight**: Perhaps the quadratic function \\( f(x) \\) is structured in such a way that specific relationships between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) exist beyond just equating coefficients.\n\n**For example**: Consider that \\( f(x) \\) might have particular properties like being symmetric, having specific roots, or satisfying certain functional equations.\n\n**Brainstorming**:\n\n- **Symmetry**: Does \\( f(x) \\) need to be symmetric around its vertex?\n- **Roots**: Do the roots of \\( f(x) \\) relate to the constants on the right side?\n- **Functional Relationships**: Is there a pattern or functional identity that \\( f(x) \\) must satisfy?\n\n**Reflection**: **This might lead to a deeper understanding** and potentially simplify the problem by identifying inherent properties of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**Decision**: **Attempt to identify such properties** that could provide constraints on \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 21: Examining Symmetry in Quadratics**\n\n **Idea**: Quadratics are symmetric around their vertex. If \\( f(x) \\) is symmetric, then \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\), but this isn\u2019t generally the case for all quadratics unless specifically stated.\n\n**Given**:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + ax + b\n\\]\n\nBut unless more information is provided, **assuming symmetry is unfounded**.\n\n**Reflection**: **Since there's no indication of symmetry, this isn't a valid path.**\n\n**Conclusion**: **Symmetry doesn't apply here, so we must rely on coefficient matching and possibly other relationships.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 22: Seeking Alternative Insights**\n\n **Considering Alternative Strategies**: Perhaps there's a **pattern** or **property of quadratic functions** that can be utilized.\n\nOne possible insight is that for such functional equations involving compositions and ratios, **the degree of polynomials** must match appropriately.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- **Degree of the Denominator:** \\( \\deg(f(x)) = 2 \\)\n- **Degree of the Right Side:** \\( x^2 + 1776x + 2010 \\) has degree 2.\n\nTherefore, the **numerator must also have degree 2** when \\( f(f(x) + x) \\) is fully expanded. \n\n**This implies** that:\n\n\\[\n\\deg(f(f(x) + x)) = \\deg(f(x)) \\times \\deg(f(x) + x) = 2 \\times 2 = 4\n\\]\n\nBut our right side is degree 2. **This suggests that f(x) must be such that higher degrees cancel out or don\u2019t contribute to the final degree.**\n\n**Reflection**: **This is an interesting observation** but doesn't directly help in solving for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) without additional constraints.\n\n**Possible Insight**: **Maybe \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are chosen such that specific higher-order terms cancel out**, leading to a valid equation.\n\n**Alternative Approach**: **Attempt to simplify the problem by assuming specific values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)** that maintain this degree balance.\n\n**Decision**: **Select specific values** to test if they satisfy the equation, keeping in mind that this approach is more trial-and-error based.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 23: Testing Specific Values**\n\n **Idea**: Let\u2019s assume specific values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to see if they satisfy all equations.\n\nOne possible simple choice is to set \\( b = 0 \\) and see if \\( a \\) can be determined accordingly.\n\n**Assuming \\( b = 0 \\)**:\n\nFrom the constant term equation:\n\n\\[\nb(b + a - 2009) = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 0(0 + a - 2009) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is always true, so \\( b = 0 \\) is feasible.\n\nNow, substitute \\( b = 0 \\) into the \\( x^3 \\) coefficient equation:\n\n\\[\n3a + 2 = 1776 + a\n\\]\n\\[\n2a = 1774\n\\]\n\\[\na = 887\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: **This suggests \\( a = 887 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\)**. Let\u2019s now verify if these values satisfy the \\( x^2 \\) coefficient equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 24: Verifying \\( a = 887 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\)**\n\n **Given**:\n\n\\[\na^2 + 3a + 1 + 2b = 2010 + 1776a + b\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( a = 887 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n(887)^2 + 3(887) + 1 + 2(0) = 2010 + 1776(887) + 0\n\\]\n\nCalculating both sides:\n\n**Left Side**:\n\n\\[\n789769 + 2661 + 1 + 0 = 792431\n\\]\n\n**Right Side**:\n\n\\[\n2010 + 1571502 + 0 = 1573512\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: **Again, there\u2019s a significant discrepancy** between both sides. This suggests that **the assumption \\( a = 887 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\) is incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**: **Assuming \\( b = 0 \\) leads to inconsistency**, indicating that **another approach is necessary**.\n\n**Realization**: **Perhaps \\( b \\) cannot be zero**, or the relationship between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is more complex than initially thought.\n\n**Possible Insight**: **Maybe there\u2019s a hidden relationship between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) that needs to be uncovered.**\n\n**Alternative Strategy**: **Consider looking for additional equations or constraints that can relate \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 25: Finding More Equations**\n\n **Looking back**, perhaps the earlier steps missed additional constraints.\n\nLet\u2019s re-examine the coefficient equations:\n\n1. **\\( x^4 \\) Coefficient:** \\( 1 = 1 \\) \u2014 No information.\n2. **\\( x^3 \\) Coefficient:** \\( 3a + 2 = 1776 + a \\)\n3. **\\( x^2 \\) Coefficient:** \\( a^2 + 3a + 1 + 2b = 2010 + 1776a + b \\)\n4. **\\( x \\) Coefficient:** \\( \\text{(Messy expression)} = 2010a + 1776b \\)\n5. **Constant Term:** \\( b^2 + b + ab = 2010b \\)\n\n**Reexamining the Constant Term Equation:**\n\n\\[\nb(b + a - 2009) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives:\n\n\\[\nb = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad b + a = 2009 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a = 2009 - b\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: **Given that \\( b = 0 \\) leads to inconsistency**, the only viable solution is \\( a = 2009 - b \\).\n\n**Substituting \\( a = 2009 - b \\)** into the \\( x^3 \\) coefficient equation:\n\n\\[\n3(2009 - b) + 2 = 1776 + (2009 - b)\n\\]\n\\[\n6027 - 3b + 2 = 1776 + 2009 - b\n\\]\n\\[\n6029 - 3b = 3785 - b\n\\]\n\\[\n6029 - 3785 = 3b - b\n\\]\n\\[\n2244 = 2b\n\\]\n\\[\nb = 1122\n\\]\n\\[\na = 2009 - 1122 = 887\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: **This suggests that \\( a = 887 \\) and \\( b = 1122 \\)**, which aligns with our earlier calculations before realizing the inconsistency.\n\n**Checking Consistency**: Let\u2019s verify if these values satisfy all coefficient equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 26: Verifying \\( a = 887 \\) and \\( b = 1122 \\)**\n\n **Given**:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + 887x + 1122\n\\]\n\n**Coefficient Equations**:\n\n1. **\\( x^4 \\):** \\( 1 = 1 \\) \u2014 Already matches.\n2. **\\( x^3 \\):** \\( 3(887) + 2 = 1776 + 887 \\)\n   \\[\n   2661 + 2 = 2663\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1776 + 887 = 2663\n   \\]\n   **Matches**.\n3. **\\( x^2 \\):** \\( 887^2 + 3(887) + 1 + 2(1122) = 2010 + 1776(887) + 1122 \\)\n   \\[\n   789769 + 2661 + 1 + 2244 = 792675\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2010 + 1571856 + 1122 = 1574988\n   \\]\n   \n   **Reflection**: There\u2019s a **discrepancy**.
