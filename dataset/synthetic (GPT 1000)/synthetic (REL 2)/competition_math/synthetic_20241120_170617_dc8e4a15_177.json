    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would tackle it in real life. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my thoughts, and naturally check my work along the way to make sure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see a triangle \\( \\triangle DBC \\) with points \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) as midpoints of sides \\( \\overline{AB} \\) and \\( \\overline{BC} \\), respectively. The goal is to determine the area of this triangle.\n\nImmediately, a few thoughts come to mind:\n\n- **Midpoints Involvement:** Since \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) are midpoints, perhaps properties of medians or the midpoint theorem could be useful here.\n  \n- **Coordinate Geometry:** Given the coordinates are provided, maybe using the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices in a coordinate plane could be effective.\n\n- **Similar Triangles or Congruence:** Maybe exploring if \\( \\triangle DBC \\) is similar or congruent to any other triangles in the figure could help.\n\nInitially, I'm leaning towards using the **coordinate geometry approach**, as the coordinates are given, and this would provide a straightforward way to calculate the area. But I want to explore other strategies to ensure this is the best method.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Coordinate Geometry Approach:**\n   - Use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices' coordinates.\n   \n2. **Midpoint Theorem:**\n   - Utilize properties of midpoints and medians to find relationships between the triangles.\n\n3. **Congruent Triangles:**\n   - Check if \\( \\triangle DBC \\) is congruent to any other triangle, which might simplify finding the area.\n\n4. **Parallel Lines and Transversals:**\n   - Maybe consider if there are parallel lines that create equal areas or similar triangles.\n\nWait, before committing to one method, let\u2019s reflect: Given that midpoints are involved and the coordinates are known, the **coordinate geometry approach** seems the most direct. However, if that feels too complicated, the **Midpoint Theorem** could provide a shortcut.\n\nLet\u2019s try the **coordinate geometry approach** first. If it gets too messy, I\u2019ll switch to another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Coordinates**\n\nFrom the diagram:\n\n- \\( A(0, 6) \\)\n- \\( B(0, 0) \\)\n- \\( C(8, 0) \\)\n- \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) are midpoints:\n  - \\( D \\) is the midpoint of \\( \\overline{AB} \\)\n  - \\( E \\) is the midpoint of \\( \\overline{BC} \\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- \\( D \\left( \\frac{0 + 0}{2}, \\frac{6 + 0}{2} \\right) = (0, 3) \\)\n- \\( E \\left( \\frac{0 + 8}{2}, \\frac{0 + 0}{2} \\right) = (4, 0) \\)\n\nOkay, that\u2019s straightforward. I think I got the midpoints correct. Let\u2019s proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Area Formula for Coordinates**\n\nNow, I\u2019ll use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \\right|\n\\]\n\nApplying this to \\( \\triangle DBC \\):\n\n- Let\u2019s assign the vertices:\n  - \\( D(0, 3) \\)\n  - \\( B(0, 0) \\)\n  - \\( C(8, 0) \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0(0 - 0) + 0(0 - 3) + 8(3 - 0) \\right|\n\\]\n\nSimplifying step by step:\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\left| 0 + 0 + 24 \\right|\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{2} \\times 24\n\\]\n\\[\n= 12\n\\]\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check the steps:\n\n- Plugged in the correct coordinates?\n- Followed the formula correctly?\n\nEverything looks in order. The area calculates to **12** square units.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Reflection and Verification**\n\nWait, let me reflect on this. Does an area of 12 make sense for a triangle with these coordinates?\n\n- **Visual Check:** The triangle \\( \\triangle DBC \\) is part of the larger triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\). Since \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) are midpoints, \\( \\triangle DBC \\) should be half the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n- **Calculating \\( \\triangle ABC \\) Area:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area}_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 6 = 24\n  \\]\n\n  Since \\( \\triangle DBC \\) is half of \\( \\triangle ABC \\), its area should indeed be:\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{24}{2} = 12\n  \\]\n\nThis aligns perfectly. So, the area of \\( \\triangle DBC \\) being **12** square units seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Midpoint Theorem**\n\nJust to be thorough, let\u2019s consider using the **Midpoint Theorem**:\n\n- **Theorem Statement:** A line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.\n\nApplying this:\n\n- \\( DE \\) is parallel to \\( AC \\) and half its length.\n- This implies that \\( \\triangle DBC \\) is similar to \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with a ratio of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n  \nTherefore, the area ratio should be:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\triangle DBC} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\text{Area}_{\\triangle ABC} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 24 = 6\n\\]\n\nWait, this seems off. According to this theorem, the area would be **6** square units, but our earlier calculation using the coordinate geometry approach gave **12** square units.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, I need to check why there's a discrepancy. The Midpoint Theorem suggests that \\( \\triangle DBC \\) should be half the area of \\( \\triangle ABC \\), not a quarter. Let\u2019s re-examine:\n\n- **Understanding the Midpoint Theorem:** The theorem states that the line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides is parallel to the third side and half its length. However, in this case, \\( DE \\) is indeed parallel to \\( AC \\) and half its length, which suggests similarity.\n\n- **Correct Ratio:** Since \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) are midpoints, the ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles \\( \\triangle DBC \\) and \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). Therefore, the area ratio should be \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\), but that would imply an area of **6**, which contradicts our coordinate geometry result.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere seems to be a misunderstanding. The **Midpoint Theorem** correctly indicates that \\( \\triangle DBC \\) is similar to \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with a ratio of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), so the area should indeed be \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of \\( \\triangle ABC \\). However, our coordinate geometry approach gave an area of **12**, which corresponds to half of \\( \\triangle ABC \\).\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nTo resolve this, let's consider the structure of the triangle and the role of points \\( D \\) and \\( E \\):\n\n- \\( D \\) is the midpoint of \\( \\overline{AB} \\), and \\( E \\) is the midpoint of \\( \\overline{BC} \\).\n- The line segment \\( \\overline{DE} \\) connects these midpoints, creating two trapezoids within \\( \\triangle ABC \\) and thus sub-triangles like \\( \\triangle DBC \\).\n\nGiven this, the area calculation using the coordinate approach seems more direct and accurate. The **Midpoint Theorem** application here led to confusion because it simplifies the triangle differently by considering parallel lines and umed proportions.\n\nLet's trust the **coordinate geometry approach**, ensuring that each step aligns with the given coordinates and formulas.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12 \\text{ square units}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nReflecting on the whole process:\n\n- **Multiple Strategies:** Exploring both coordinate geometry and the Midpoint Theorem helped identify the correct approach.\n\n- **Checking Work:** Verifying each step ensured the calculations were accurate.\n\n- **Handling Discrepancies:** Recognizing and resolving the conflict between different methods solidified the correctness of the final answer.\n\n- **Lesson Learned:** It's essential to understand the application of theorems correctly to avoid confusion, especially when multiple strategies yield different results.\n\nBy thinking through each step, checking reflections, and being open to adjusting the approach, I've confidently arrived at the correct area for \\( \\triangle DBC \\).",
