    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. The goal is to find the area of a circle centered at \\(P\\) and passing through \\(Q\\), expressing the answer in terms of \\(\\pi\\). \n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Understanding the Circle:** Circles are defined by their center and radius. Here, the center is \\(P\\), and the circle passes through \\(Q\\). So, the distance between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) should be the radius.\n  \n- **Determining the Radius:** I need to find the distance from \\(P\\) to \\(Q\\). This seems like a straightforward distance calculation between two points in a coordinate plane.\n  \n- **Calculating the Area:** Once I have the radius, I can use the formula for the area of a circle, \\(A = \\pi r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Yes, calculating the distance between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) to find the radius seems correct. Then, using that radius to find the area is the standard approach.\n\n- **Checking for Alternatives:** Alternatively, I could plot the points to visualize, but since the question asks for a numerical answer, sticking to calculations is more efficient.\n\n### **Step 1: Find the Coordinates of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\)**\n\nLet me take a look at the provided diagram:\n\n- **Coordinates of \\(P\\):** \\((-3, 4)\\)\n- **Coordinates of \\(Q\\):** \\((9, -3)\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- **Extracting Information:** It's essential to accurately obtain the coordinates from the diagram to ensure the calculations are correct.\n  \n- **Checking for Accuracy:** I'll double-check to make sure I\u2019ve noted the signs correctly (negative or positive).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait, Did I Get It Right?** Yes, \\(P\\) is at \\((-3, 4)\\), and \\(Q\\) is at \\((9, -3)\\). The signs seem correct.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Distance Between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\)**\n\n**Thinking:**\n- **Formula for Distance:** To find the radius, I'll use the distance formula between two points:\n  \n  \\[\n  r = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n  \\]\n  \n  where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are the coordinates of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\).\n\n- **Plugging in the Coordinates:**\n  \n  \\[\n  r = \\sqrt{(9 - (-3))^2 + (-3 - 4)^2}\n  \\]\n  \n  Simplifying inside the parentheses:\n  \n  \\[\n  r = \\sqrt{(9 + 3)^2 + (-7)^2} = \\sqrt{12^2 + 49} = \\sqrt{144 + 49} = \\sqrt{193}\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Does This Result Make Sense?** The distance \\(\\sqrt{193}\\) seems reasonable given the coordinates. It\u2019s a bit messy, but that\u2019s expected with square roots.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Let me quickly verify the calculations:\n  \n  - \\(9 - (-3) = 12\\), correct.\n  - \\((-3) - 4 = -7\\), correct.\n  - \\(12^2 = 144\\) and \\((-7)^2 = 49\\), correct.\n  - \\(144 + 49 = 193\\), correct.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Circle**\n\n**Thinking:**\n- **Formula for Area:** Now that I have the radius \\(r = \\sqrt{193}\\)\\, I can find the area using:\n  \n  \\[\n  A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (\\sqrt{193})^2 = \\pi \\times 193 = 193\\pi\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Wait, Is This Correct?** Yes, squaring \\(\\sqrt{193}\\) gives \\(193\\), and multiplying by \\(\\pi\\) gives the area in terms of \\(\\pi\\), as required.\n\n- **Double-Checking:** Let me ensure every step leads logically to this result:\n  \n  - The distance calculation was correct.\n  - The area formula is applied correctly.\n  - The units are in terms of \\(\\pi\\), as specified.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thinking:**\n- **Re-evaluating Each Step:** Let\u2019s make sure there are no errors:\n  \n  - The distance between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) was calculated accurately.\n  - The area formula was correctly applied.\n  - The answer is expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\), as requested.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Does the Final Answer Make Sense?** The area being \\(193\\pi\\) units\u00b2 fits logically with the calculated radius. The \\(\\pi\\) component is correct since we\u2019re dealing with circles.\n\n- **Quick Confirm:** A number like \\(193\\pi\\) is reasonable for an area, especially given the radius involved.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies, confirming the accuracy of each step, and reflecting on the correctness of the approach, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{193\\pi}\n\\]\n\nThis result represents the area of the circle with center \\(P\\) and passing through \\(Q\\), expressed in terms of \\(\\pi\\) as required.",
