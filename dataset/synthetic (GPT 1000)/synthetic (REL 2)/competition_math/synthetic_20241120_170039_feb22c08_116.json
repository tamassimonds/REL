    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, emulating human thinking with brainstorming, reflection, and checks along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, looking at the question: \"If Heidi can paint a wall in 45 minutes, what fractional part of the wall can she paint in 9 minutes?\"\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of **rate problems** I've encountered before. It seems like a question about how much work can be done in a shorter time frame compared to the total time needed.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Proportions:** Maybe I can set up a proportion to find out how much of the wall is painted in 9 minutes compared to 45 minutes.\n  2. **Fraction of Time:** Alternatively, I could consider what fraction 9 minutes is of the total 45 minutes and apply that to the whole wall.\n  3. **Decimal Conversion:** Converting minutes to decimal hours and calculating the painting rate per hour might be another approach.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not sure which method will be the most straightforward. The proportion method seems direct, but I'm also curious if calculating the painting rate per minute would simplify things.\n\n- **Exploring the Proportion Method First:**\n  - **Thought:** Perhaps I can compare the part of the wall painted in 9 minutes to the part painted in 45 minutes using a ratio.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Let's see if setting up a proportion where the whole wall is represented as 1 (or 100%) makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up a Proportion**\n\n**Approach:** Let\u2019s assume the entire wall is represented by 1 (or 100%). If Heidi paints the entire wall in 45 minutes, what part of the wall does she paint in 9 minutes?\n\n- **Proportion Setup:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Part Painted in 9 minutes}}{\\text{Whole Wall}} = \\frac{9 \\text{ minutes}}{45 \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]\n\n- **Simplifying the Proportion:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Part Painted in 9 minutes}}{1} = \\frac{9}{45}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, let me simplify that fraction to make it clearer.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{45} = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\n- **Conclusion from Step 1:** So, according to this proportion, Heidi paints \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the wall in 9 minutes.\n\n- **Quick Check:** Does \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) make sense? Since 45 minutes divided by 9 minutes is 5, and painting the whole wall in 45 minutes means each 9-minute segment covers \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the wall. This seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying with the Fraction of Time Method**\n\n**Approach:** Let\u2019s verify the result by calculating what fraction of the total time 9 minutes represents.\n\n- **Fraction of Time Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction of Total Time} = \\frac{9 \\text{ minutes}}{45 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This matches our previous result using the proportion method. It reinforces that Heidi paints \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the wall in 9 minutes.\n\n- **Thought:** It\u2019s always good to cross-check using different methods to ensure the answer is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Trying the Decimal Conversion Method**\n\n**Approach:** Let\u2019s convert the painting rates into decimals to see if it aligns with our previous findings.\n\n- **Converting Minutes to Hours:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Time in Hours} = 45 \\text{ minutes} \u00f7 60 = 0.75 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time in Hours for 9 Minutes} = 9 \\text{ minutes} \u00f7 60 = 0.15 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n- **Calculating Painting Rate per Hour:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate} = \\frac{1 \\text{ wall}}{0.75 \\text{ hours}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ walls per hour}\n\\]\n\n- **Applying the Rate to 0.15 Hours:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Part Painted} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 0.15 = \\frac{4 \\times 0.15}{3} = \\frac{0.6}{3} = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\n- **Reflection:** This method also yields \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\), confirming our earlier results.\n\n- **Check:** It\u2019s interesting to see that regardless of the method\u2014proportion, fraction of time, or decimal conversion\u2014we arrive at the same fractional part of the wall: \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\n- **Thought:** This consistency suggests that the calculations are correct. It's reassuring to have multiple approaches lead to the same answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Verification and Conclusion**\n\n**Approach:** Let\u2019s ensure all steps logically lead to the final answer and confirm that no mistakes were made along the way.\n\n- **Review of Proportion Method:** Setting up the proportion was straightforward, and simplifying the fraction to \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) aligned with the total time ratio.\n\n- **Review of Fraction of Time Method:** Calculating the fraction of 45 minutes that 9 minutes represents directly gave us \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\n- **Review of Decimal Conversion Method:** Converting time into hours and calculating the painting rate per hour resulted in the same fractional part.\n\n- **Reflection:** All methods converged to the same result, indicating the correctness of the approach. There were no dead ends or mistakes, and every step naturally followed from the previous one.\n\n- **Check:** Does \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) make sense in the context? Yes, since 9 minutes is one-fifth of 45 minutes, it logically follows that Heidi would paint \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the wall in that time.\n\n- **Final Thought:** It's always beneficial to explore different strategies and cross-verify results. This not only builds confidence in the solution but also helps identify any potential errors early on.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Heidi can paint \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the wall in 9 minutes.**\n\n---\n\nBy laying out each step carefully, exploring multiple strategies, and continuously reflecting and verifying, we ensure a comprehensive and accurate solution to the problem.

  "ground_truth": "Since $9$ minutes is $1/5$ of $45$ minutes, we can find the fractional part of a wall that Heidi can paint in $9$ minutes by dividing the amount of wall that Heidi can paint in $45$ minutes by $5$. Since Heidi can paint a whole wall in $45$ minutes, it follows that she can paint $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$ of a wall in $9$ minutes."
