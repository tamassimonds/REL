    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through it as naturally as possible. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often to see if I'm on the right path, and checking my work along the way to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, my immediate reaction is: **\"Daniel has 20 pieces of candy and needs to divide them among his 3 sisters equally. But 20 isn't divisible by 3, so there must be a remainder.\"** \n\nThis reminds me of problems involving finding remainders or adjusting quantities to achieve equal distribution. But it's been a while since I've dealt with something like this, so I'm not entirely sure how to proceed initially.\n\nI think I should explore strategies related to **divisibility, remainders, and perhaps even factors or multiples.** Let me jot down what comes to mind:\n\n1. **Divisibility Check:** See if 20 is divisible by 3.\n2. **Calculate Remainder:** Determine what the remainder is when 20 is divided by 3.\n3. **Adjust Quantity:** Figure out how many pieces need to be removed to make 20 divisible by 3.\n4. **Explore Multiples of 3:** Consider the nearest multiple of 3 less than 20.\n\nWait, before diving in, let me **reflect**: Does removing candy make sense? Yes, because the problem asks for the least number of pieces to be taken away to enable equal distribution.\n\nOkay, let's proceed with exploring these strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Check Divisibility by 3**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFirst, let's see if 20 is divisible by 3. If it is, then no candy needs to be removed. But I suspect it's not since my initial thought was that there would be a remainder.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- **Divide 20 by 3:**  \n  \\[\n  20 \\div 3 = 6\\ with\\ a\\ remainder\\ of\\ 2\\ (because\\ 3 \\times 6 = 18\\ and\\ 20 - 18 = 2)\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nAh, so there's a remainder of 2. This confirms that 20 is **not** divisible by 3, which aligns with my initial thought. Therefore, Daniel **cannot** distribute all 20 pieces equally among his sisters without removing some.\n\n**Check:**  \nThis seems correct because 20 divided by 3 gives a whole number (6) with 2 pieces left over.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Least Number of Pieces to Remove**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I know 20 isn't divisible by 3, I need to find out how many pieces Daniel should take away to make the total divisible by 3. \n\nI recall that making a number divisible by another often involves adjusting it by its remainder. In this case, since the remainder is 2, perhaps removing 2 pieces would work.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- **If Daniel removes 2 pieces:**  \n  \\[\n  20 - 2 = 18\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check if 18 is divisible by 3:**  \n  \\[\n  18 \\div 3 = 6\\ (no\\ remainder)\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nRemoving 2 pieces makes the total 18, which is perfectly divisible by 3. This feels like the right approach because it aligns with making the total divisible without over-removing candy.\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me double-check:  \n- 18 divided by 3 equals 6 with no remainder.  \n- Since I only removed 2 pieces from 20, that's the least necessary to achieve equal distribution.\n\nThis checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verify by Considering Multiple Strategies**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nTo ensure the solution is correct, let's think about it from different angles:\n\n1. **Nearest Multiple of 3 Less than 20:**  \n   - The largest multiple of 3 less than 20 is 18.  \n   - Difference between 20 and 18 is 2.\n\n2. **Exploring Removing More Than 2 Pieces:**  \n   - If Daniel removed 3 pieces:  \n     \\[\n     20 - 3 = 17\\ which\\ is\\ not\\ divisible\\ by\\ 3\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, removing 3 is unnecessary and goes beyond what's needed.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis reaffirms that removing just 2 pieces is the **least** amount necessary. Exploring removing more than 2 confirms that it overshoots the requirement.\n\n**Check:**  \nEvery strategy points to removing 2 pieces as the optimal solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Verification Using a Different Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet me try a different method to ensure robustness. Perhaps considering the relationship between 20 and multiples of 3 can provide additional insight.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n- **Multiples of 3 Up to 20:**  \n  \\[\n  3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18\n  \\]\n  \n- **Closest Multiple Less Than 20:**  \n  \\[\n  18\\ (20 - 18 = 2)\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**  \nAgain, removing 2 pieces brings the total to 18, a multiple of 3. This alternative approach aligns with our previous steps, confirming that 2 is indeed the correct number to remove.\n\n**Check:**  \nNo discrepancies here; all methods consistently lead to the same conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThrough exploring multiple strategies\u2014checking divisibility, calculating remainders, and verifying with different approaches\u2014I\u2019ve determined that Daniel needs to **remove 2 pieces** of candy to distribute the remaining 18 equally among his 3 sisters. \n\nThis step-by-step reflection ensured that each part of the process was correct, and cross-checking with various methods confirmed the validity of the solution. \n\nBy thinking through it like a human\u2014brainstorming, checking, reflecting, and adjusting\u2014I arrived at the most logical and accurate answer.",
