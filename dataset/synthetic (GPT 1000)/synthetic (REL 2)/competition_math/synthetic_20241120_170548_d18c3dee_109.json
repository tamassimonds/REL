    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check if my approach is correct, and be ready to pivot if something doesn't seem right. Let's dive in!\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, I see it's about finding the area of a shaded region within a regular hexagon with a side length of 10 cm. My initial thoughts are:\n\n- **Regular Hexagon:** Okay, I remember that a regular hexagon has all sides equal and can be divided into smaller, equal triangles.\n- **Shaded Region:** The shape of the shaded area looks like a quadrilateral made up of certain vertices. I wonder if I can relate this to triangles or other polygons within the hexagon.\n- **Area Calculation:** I know there are formulas for the area of a hexagon and triangles. Maybe I can subtract the area of certain parts from the whole hexagon.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Let's brainstorm a few strategies.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Divide and Conquer:** \n   - **Idea:** Divide the hexagon into smaller triangles and quadrilaterals. Calculate their areas separately and sum them up as needed.\n   - **Reflection:** This seems like a solid approach since areas of triangles are straightforward to calculate.\n\n2. **Use the Regular Hexagon Area Formula:**\n   - **Idea:** Since I know the formula for the area of a regular hexagon, maybe I can calculate the total area and subtract the area of the unshaded parts.\n   - **Reflection:** This might work if I can accurately determine the area of the unshaded parts.\n\n3. **Coordinate Geometry:**\n   - **Idea:** Assign coordinates to the vertices of the hexagon and use integration or distance formulas to find the area of the shaded region.\n   - **Reflection:** This feels more advanced and might complicate things, but it's an option.\n\n4. **Symmetry Consideration:**\n   - **Idea:** Leverage the symmetry of the hexagon to simplify calculations, perhaps by recognizing that certain diagonals divide it into equal areas.\n   - **Reflection:** Maybe I can use this to calculate just the area of the shaded part without dealing with the entire hexagon.\n\n### **Choosing a Starting Point**\n\nI'll start with the **Divide and Conquer** approach by dividing the hexagon into triangles and quadrilaterals. If this seems too complicated or doesn't lead to a clear solution, I'll reconsider and possibly switch to using the area formulas or symmetry.\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying Components of the Hexagon**\n\nFirst, let's visualize the hexagon:\n\n- **Vertices:** Label the vertices \\( A, B, C, D, E, F \\) in clockwise order.\n- **Shaded Quadrilateral:** The shaded region is likely the quadrilateral formed by points \\( B, C, E, \\) and \\( F \\).\n\n**Thought Bubble:** Is this correct? Wait, let me double-check the Asymptote diagram to ensure I'm identifying the correct vertices.\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, which defines the hexagon's vertices based on directions, I see:\n\n- \\( B = \\text{dir}(60) \\)\n- \\( C = \\text{dir}(120) \\)\n- \\( E = \\text{dir}(240) \\)\n- \\( F = \\text{dir}(300) \\)\n\nSo, the shaded region is indeed quadrilateral \\( BCEF \\).\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Area of the Shaded Quadrilateral**\n\nNow, I need to find the area of quadrilateral \\( BCEF \\). One way to do this is by dividing it into smaller triangles.\n\n**Strategy:** Divide \\( BCEF \\) into two triangles: \\( \\triangle BCE \\) and \\( \\triangle BCF \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n1. **Find the Area of \\( \\triangle BCE \\):**\n   - Use the formula for the area of a triangle: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n     \\]\n   - But to find the base and height, I need to know the lengths and angles involved.\n\n2. **Find the Area of \\( \\triangle BCF \\):**\n   - Similarly, use the triangle area formula, possibly needing coordinates or trigonometric identities.\n\n### **Brainstorming Again**\n\nWait a moment. This seems like a lot of work, and I'm not sure if it's the easiest path. Perhaps there's a more straightforward method using the properties of the hexagon.\n\n**Alternative Strategy:** **Use Symmetry and the Regular Hexagon Area Formula**\n\n- Since the hexagon is regular, all sides are equal, and the interior angles are all \\(120^\\circ\\).\n- The area of the hexagon can be calculated using:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\n  \\]\n  where \\( s \\) is the side length.\n- Maybe I can find the area of the entire hexagon and then subtract the areas of the two unshaded triangles (if any).\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Total Area of the Hexagon**\n\nGiven the side length \\( s = 10 \\) cm, let's calculate the area:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 10^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 100 = 150\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** That makes sense. The area formula for a regular hexagon is straightforward, and the calculation seems correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying Unshaded Regions**\n\nNow, let's identify the unshaded parts. From the diagram, it looks like:\n\n- There are two triangles outside the quadrilateral \\( BCEF \\): \n  - \\( \\triangle ABD \\)\n  - \\( \\triangle DEF \\)\n\n**Thought Bubble:** Wait, is that correct? Let me verify by looking at the hexagon's diagonals and which parts are shaded.\n\n**Check:** The shaded quadrilateral \\( BCEF \\) connects non-adjacent vertices, leaving two triangles unshaded, so my identification seems correct.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Area of the Unshaded Triangles**\n\nLet's calculate the areas of \\( \\triangle ABD \\) and \\( \\triangle DEF \\).\n\n**Strategy:** Use the formula for the area of a triangle. Since these are isosceles triangles with sides 10 cm, I can use trigonometry to find the height.\n\n1. **Calculating the Area of \\( \\triangle ABD \\):**\n   - Base \\( AB = 10 \\) cm\n   - Height can be found using the angle \\( \\angle ADB = 60^\\circ\\) (since angles in a regular hexagon are \\(120^\\circ\\), and \\( \\triangle ABD\\) is isosceles)\n   - Use:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Height} = AB \\times \\sin(60^\\circ) = 10 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}\n     \\]\n   - Area:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{\\triangle ABD} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 5\\sqrt{3} = 25\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the Area of \\( \\triangle DEF \\):**\n   - By symmetry, \\( \\triangle DEF \\) is identical to \\( \\triangle ABD \\).\n   - So, its area is also \\( 25\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2 \\).\n\n### **Reflection**\n\nDoes this make sense? Yes, because the hexagon is regular, and the triangles \\( \\triangle ABD \\) and \\( \\triangle DEF \\) are congruent.\n\n### **Step 6: Total Area of the Unshaded Part**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Unshaded Area} = \\text{Area}_{\\triangle ABD} + \\text{Area}_{\\triangle DEF} = 25\\sqrt{3} + 25\\sqrt{3} = 50\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n\\]\n\n### **Step 7: Calculating the Area of the Shaded Quadrilateral \\( BCEF \\)**\n\nNow, let's find the area of the shaded quadrilateral by subtracting the area of the unshaded triangles from the total area of the hexagon.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{BCEF} = \\text{Total Hexagon Area} - \\text{Total Unshaded Area} = 150\\sqrt{3} - 50\\sqrt{3} = 100\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm}^2\n\\]\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\n**Quick Check:** Does the shaded area make sense? The shaded region is a quadrilateral connecting four vertices of the hexagon, leaving two congruent triangles unshaded. Since the hexagon is regular and symmetric, subtracting the areas of the two triangles from the total hexagon area seems correct.\n\n**Deeper Reflection:** The calculations for the triangles' areas align with the properties of a regular hexagon. The base and height calculations check out. The symmetry ensures that both triangles have equal areas, and the subtraction from the total area is accurate.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe area of the shaded region \\( BCEF \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{100\\sqrt{3}} \\text{ cm}^2\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy dividing the hexagon into manageable components (triangles and quadrilaterals) and leveraging the symmetry of the regular hexagon, I was able to calculate the area of the shaded region systematically. Starting with identifying the components, calculating their areas, and reflecting at each step ensured accuracy. Using alternative strategies, like the regular hexagon area formula, provided a quicker path to the solution, confirming the correctness of the approach.\n\nOverall, brainstorming different strategies, checking work continuously, and being open to adjusting the approach led to a clear and accurate solution.",

These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince $AB=BC=10$, we have $BH = AB/2 = 5$ and $AH = CH = \\sqrt{10^2-5^2} = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}$.  (Notice that this value is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $BH$, the short leg.  In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $AC = 2\\cdot 5\\sqrt{3} = 10\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe shaded region is a rectangle with base length $10$ and height length $10\\sqrt{3}$; its area is $10\\cdot 10\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{100\\sqrt{3}}$ square cm."
