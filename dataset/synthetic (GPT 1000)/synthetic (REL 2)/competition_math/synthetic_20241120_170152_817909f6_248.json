    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together. I'll try to brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their correctness, adjust my approach if needed, and check my work frequently\u2014just like a human would when tackling a math question.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, it reminds me of dealing with **modular arithmetic** or **congruences**\u2014concepts I've encountered before. The question involves three positive integers with specific remainders when divided by 12, and then asks for the remainder when their sum is divided by 12.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Modular Arithmetic Approach:** This is the first thing that comes to mind because it deals directly with remainders.\n- **Set Up Equations:** Maybe setting up equations based on the given remainders could help.\n- **Check Patterns:** Perhaps looking for patterns in multiples of 12 might reveal something.\n\nHonestly, I'm leaning towards using modular arithmetic since it's directly related, but I'm open to exploring other strategies if this doesn't pan out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting the Modular Arithmetic Approach**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the **modular arithmetic** method.\n\nThe problem states:\n- Integer **A** when divided by 12 gives a remainder of 7 \u2192 \\( A \\equiv 7 \\mod{12} \\)\n- Integer **B** when divided by 12 gives a remainder of 9 \u2192 \\( B \\equiv 9 \\mod{12} \\)\n- Integer **C** when divided by 12 gives a remainder of 10 \u2192 \\( C \\equiv 10 \\mod{12} \\)\n\nNow, I need to find the remainder when \\( A + B + C \\) is divided by 12:\n\\[ \n(A + B + C) \\mod{12} \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Thinking:** I recall that in modular arithmetic, you can add congruences. So, perhaps adding these congruences could lead me to the solution.\n- **Calculation:** Let's add the remainders together:\n  \\[\n  A \\equiv 7 \\mod{12} \\\\\n  B \\equiv 9 \\mod{12} \\\\\n  C \\equiv 10 \\mod{12} \\\\\n  \\hline\n  A + B + C \\equiv 7 + 9 + 10 \\mod{12} \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  7 + 9 + 10 = 26 \n  \\]\n  \\[\n  26 \\mod{12} = 2\n  \\]\n\n**Natural Check:**\nWait a minute. Let me think about this. 26 divided by 12 gives a remainder of 2. This seems reasonable, but I want to make sure by considering another method.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring an Alternative Strategy\u2014Verifying with Specific Numbers**\n\nSince I'm not entirely sure if adding the remainders directly is foolproof, maybe I should verify this by thinking about specific integers that fit these congruences.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Thinking:** If I can find actual numbers that satisfy the remainders, I can check if their sum also follows the same pattern.\n- **Brainstorming:** Let's pick numbers that align with the given remainders.\n\n  - For **A:** \\( 12k + 7 \\) where \\( k \\) is any non-negative integer. Let's take \\( k = 0 \\): \n    \\[\n    A = 12(0) + 7 = 7 \n    \\]\n  \n  - For **B:** \\( 12m + 9 \\) where \\( m \\) is any non-negative integer. Let's take \\( m = 0 \\):\n    \\[\n    B = 12(0) + 9 = 9 \n    \\]\n  \n  - For **C:** \\( 12n + 10 \\) where \\( n \\) is any non-negative integer. Let's take \\( n = 0 \\):\n    \\[\n    C = 12(0) + 10 = 10 \n    \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Sum these specific integers:\n  \\[\n  7 + 9 + 10 = 26\n  \\]\n  \n- Now, find \\( 26 \\mod{12} \\):\n  \\[\n  26 \\div 12 = 2 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\ 2 \n  \\]\n\n**Realization:**\nOh, this matches the result from my previous method. So, it seems adding the remainders directly works in this case.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Reflecting on the Approaches\u2014Is There a More Efficient Way?**\n\nWhile both methods agree, I'm wondering if there's a more straightforward approach. Perhaps simplifying the sum of remainders before applying the modulus could save time.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Thinking:** Instead of adding all remainders and then taking modulo 12, maybe grouping and reducing the sum earlier might help.\n- **Exploring:** Could I reduce parts of the sum before adding?\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s group the remainders:\n\\[\n(7 + 9) + 10 = 16 + 10 = 26 \n\\]\n\nNow, reduce \\( 16 \\mod{12} \\):\n\\[\n16 \\div 12 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\ 4 \n\\]\n\nAdd the remaining 10:\n\\[\n4 + 10 = 14 \n\\]\n\nNow, reduce \\( 14 \\mod{12} \\):\n\\[\n14 \\div 12 = 1 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\ 2 \n\\]\n\n**Natural Check:**\nAgain, the remainder is 2. This approach seems a bit more organized and confirms the previous results.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Verification\u2014Using a Larger Example**\n\nTo ensure consistency, let's test the method with larger integers.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose:\n- \\( A = 7 + 12 \\times 1 = 19 \\)\n- \\( B = 9 + 12 \\times 2 = 33 \\)\n- \\( C = 10 + 12 \\times 3 = 46 \\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Sum these numbers:\n  \\[\n  19 + 33 + 46 = 98 \n  \\]\n  \n- Now, find \\( 98 \\mod{12} \\):\n  \\[\n  98 \\div 12 = 8 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\ 2 \n  \\]\n\n**Realization:**\nThe remainder is again 2, consistent with our earlier methods.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014adding the remainders directly, verifying with specific numbers, and simplifying the sum more efficiently\u2014all approaches consistently led to the same remainder: **2**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nWhen the sum of the three integers is divided by 12, the remainder is **2**.\n\n---\n\nThroughout this process, I started with selecting a familiar method, checked its validity with specific examples, considered alternative approaches for efficiency, and verified the correctness using larger numbers\u2014all while reflecting and adjusting my strategy as needed. This step-by-step thinking ensured a comprehensive and accurate solution.",
