    "working_out": "## Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. The first thing that stands out is the function \\( f(x) = -7x^4 + 3x^3 + x - 5 \\) and the information that \\( g(x) \\) is another polynomial such that the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 1.\n\nWhen I see this, I start thinking about polynomials and their degrees. I remember that the degree of a polynomial is determined by its highest exponent. So, if the sum \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) has a degree of 1, that means the highest exponent in the resulting polynomial is 1.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n1. **Compare Degrees Directly:**\n   - I could look at the degree of \\( f(x) \\) and see how \\( g(x) \\) must be structured to lower the overall degree to 1.\n\n2. **Analyze Leading Coefficients:**\n   - Maybe focusing on the leading terms (the highest degree terms) of both polynomials would help understand how they combine.\n\n3. **Set Up an Equation:**\n   - Perhaps setting up an equation where the degrees align could provide clarity.\n\n4. **Consider the Effect of Addition:**\n   - Adding polynomials usually means combining like terms, so maybe thinking about how the leading terms interact would be insightful.\n\n### Choosing the First Approach\n\nI'll start with **Comparing Degrees Directly** because it seems straightforward: if \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) has a degree of 1, then \\( g(x) \\) must be structured in a way that cancels out the higher-degree terms of \\( f(x) \\).\n\nLet\u2019s see if this works.\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing the Degree of \\( f(x) \\)\n\nLooking at \\( f(x) = -7x^4 + 3x^3 + x - 5 \\):\n\n- The highest degree term is \\( -7x^4 \\), so **the degree of \\( f(x) \\) is 4**.\n\n### Reflection\n\nSince the degree of \\( f(x) \\) is 4, but the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is supposed to be 1, it suggests that \\( g(x) \\) needs to eliminate the \\( x^4 \\) and \\( x^3 \\) terms in \\( f(x) \\). This makes me think that \\( g(x) \\) must have terms that cancel out the higher degrees in \\( f(x) \\).\n\n## Step 2: Considering the Structure of \\( g(x) \\)\n\nFor \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) to have a degree of 1, the \\( x^4 \\) and \\( x^3 \\) terms in \\( f(x) \\) must be canceled by corresponding terms in \\( g(x) \\).\n\n- **Idea:** \\( g(x) \\) should have a \\( +7x^4 \\) term to cancel out \\( -7x^4 \\) in \\( f(x) \\).\n- **And:** \\( g(x) \\) should have a \\( -3x^3 \\) term to cancel out \\( +3x^3 \\) in \\( f(x) \\).\n\n### Reflection\n\nThis suggests that **\\( g(x) \\) must have at least degree 4** with specific coefficients to cancel out the leading terms of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n## Step 3: Testing the Idea\n\nLet's assume \\( g(x) \\) is structured to cancel the \\( x^4 \\) and \\( x^3 \\) terms:\n\n\\[\ng(x) = 7x^4 - 3x^3 + bx + c\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) are coefficients for the \\( x \\) and constant terms, respectively.\n\nNow, adding \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\):\n\n\\[\nf(x) + g(x) = (-7x^4 + 7x^4) + (3x^3 - 3x^3) + (x + bx) + (-5 + c)\n\\]\n\\[\nf(x) + g(x) = 0x^4 + 0x^3 + (1 + b)x + (-5 + c)\n\\]\n\\[\nf(x) + g(x) = (1 + b)x + (-5 + c)\n\\]\n\n### Checking the Degree\n\nThe resulting polynomial has **a degree of 1** because the highest non-zero term is \\( (1 + b)x \\).\n\n### Reflection\n\nSo, by structuring \\( g(x) \\) to cancel out the \\( x^4 \\) and \\( x^3 \\) terms in \\( f(x) \\), we ensured that the degree of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) is 1. This confirms that **the degree of \\( g(x) \\) is indeed 4**.\n\n## Step 4: Verification\n\nTo make sure everything aligns, let\u2019s recap:\n\n- **Original Function \\( f(x) \\):** Degree 4.\n- **Goal:** \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) has degree 1.\n- **Requirement for \\( g(x) \\):** Cancel out the \\( x^4 \\) and \\( x^3 \\) terms in \\( f(x) \\).\n- **Proposed Structure of \\( g(x) \\):**\n  \\[\n  g(x) = 7x^4 - 3x^3 + bx + c\n  \\]\n- **Resulting Polynomial After Addition:**\n  \\[\n  f(x) + g(x) = (1 + b)x + (-5 + c)\n  \\]\n- **Degree of Resulting Polynomial:** 1.\n\nEverything checks out. The degree of \\( g(x) \\) must be 4 to ensure that the highest degree terms in \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) reduce to 1.\n\n## Alternative Approach\n\nJust to ensure robustness, let's consider another strategy: **Analyzing Leading Coefficients**.\n\n### Thinking Through This Approach\n\n- **Leading Coefficient of \\( f(x) \\):** \\( -7 \\) from \\( -7x^4 \\).\n- **To Achieve a Degree of 1:** The leading coefficient of \\( f(x) + g(x) \\) should be non-zero, and all higher-degree terms should be eliminated.\n\n### Applying This Approach\n\nIf \\( g(x) \\) has a \\( 7x^4 \\) term, it cancels out the \\( -7x^4 \\) in \\( f(x) \\). Similarly, a \\( -3x^3 \\) term in \\( g(x) \\) cancels the \\( +3x^3 \\) in \\( f(x) \\).\n\nThis aligns with our previous method, confirming that **the degree of \\( g(x) \\) is 4**.\n\n### Reflection\n\nBoth approaches lead to the same conclusion, reinforcing the correctness of the solution.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\n- **Checking Consistency:** Both methods agree that the degree of \\( g(x) \\) is 4.\n- **Confidence in the Solution:** The steps logically follow, and the reflections verify that the approach is correct.\n- **Conclusion:** The degree of \\( g(x) \\) is **4**.\n\nBy thoroughly exploring different strategies, testing hypotheses, and reflecting throughout the process, we ensure a comprehensive and accurate solution to the problem.",
