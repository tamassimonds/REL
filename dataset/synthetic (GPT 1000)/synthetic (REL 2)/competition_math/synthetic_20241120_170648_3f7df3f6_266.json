Express your answer as a common fraction.**\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\nWhen I first glance at this question, the term \"arithmetic mean\" pops out. That reminds me from school that the arithmetic mean is essentially the average. So, to find the average of two numbers, I should add them and then divide by two.\n\n**Initial Strategies:**\n\n1. **Simple Average Method:**\n   - Add \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{7}\\), then divide the sum by 2.\n\n2. **Convert to Decimal:**\n   - Convert both fractions to decimals, add them, and then find the mean. But I prefer keeping it in fractions to avoid rounding errors.\n\n3. **Find a Common Denominator First:**\n   - Before adding, find a common denominator to make the addition straightforward.\n\nI'm leaning towards the **Simple Average Method** combined with finding a common denominator, since adding fractions directly seems cleaner that way. However, let's explore it step by step to confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Trying the Simple Average Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nOkay, let's start by adding the two fractions. I\u2019ll need to find a common denominator to make this work. But before diving in, I\u2019ll jot down what I remember about adding fractions.\n\n**Adding Fractions:**\nTo add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. Once they do, you can add the numerators while keeping the denominator the same.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Identify Least Common Denominator (LCD):**\n   - The denominators are 5 and 7. The smallest number that both 5 and 7 can divide into is **35**.\n  \n   \\[\n   \\text{LCD} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert Fractions to Have Same Denominator:**\n\n   - \\(\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2 \\times 7}{5 \\times 7} = \\frac{14}{35}\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{7 \\times 5} = \\frac{20}{35}\\)\n\n3. **Add the Converted Fractions:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{14}{35} + \\frac{20}{35} = \\frac{14 + 20}{35} = \\frac{34}{35}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Arithmetic Mean:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Arithmetic Mean} = \\frac{\\frac{34}{35}}{2} = \\frac{34}{35} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{34}{70}\n   \\]\n\n**Wait, That Can't Be Right...**\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, when I look at \\(\\frac{34}{70}\\), it seems like that fraction can be simplified. Let me simplify it before finalizing the answer.\n\n**Simplification:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{34}{70} = \\frac{34 \\div 2}{70 \\div 2} = \\frac{17}{35}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nIs \\(\\frac{17}{35}\\) the simplest form? Yes, because 17 is a prime number and doesn't divide into 35.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Approach by Rechecking the Calculations**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, let me double-check each step to ensure everything adds up correctly. It's important to catch any small mistakes early.\n\n**Rechecking:**\n\n1. **Conversion to Common Denominator:**\n   - \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) to \\(\\frac{14}{35}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{7}\\) to \\(\\frac{20}{35}\\) seems correct.\n  \n2. **Addition of Fractions:**\n   - \\(\\frac{14}{35} + \\frac{20}{35} = \\frac{34}{35}\\) checks out.\n  \n3. **Dividing by 2:**\n   - \\(\\frac{34}{35} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{34}{70}\\) is correct.\n\n4. **Simplification:**\n   - \\(\\frac{34}{70} = \\frac{17}{35}\\) after dividing both numerator and denominator by 2.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 2:**\nEverything looks good. However, to ensure accuracy, let\u2019s try a different method just to confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring an Alternative Method - Weighted Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nSometimes, approaching the problem from a different angle helps catch mistakes or confirm the correct path. Let's see if there\u2019s another way to arrive at the same answer.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Weighted Mean Considering Both Fractions as Weights**\n\nGiven that both fractions are less than 1 and positive, their arithmetic mean should also be a positive fraction between them.\n\n**Idea:**\nThink of the arithmetic mean as balancing the two fractions. Since \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) is closer to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) than \\(\\frac{4}{7}\\), the mean should be slightly more than \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) but less than \\(\\frac{4}{7}\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Convert to Common Denominator Again:**\n   - Already done: \\(\\frac{34}{35}\\)\n\n2. **Divide by 2:**\n   - \\(\\frac{34}{35} \\div 2 = \\frac{34}{70} = \\frac{17}{35}\\)\n\n**Check:**\nWait a minute! This matches our previous result. It\u2019s reassuring to see that both methods agree.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Verification - Quick Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore wrapping up, let\u2019s do a quick sanity check. Does \\(\\frac{17}{35}\\) make sense as the arithmetic mean of \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{7}\\)?\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n1. **Comparing Fractions:**\n   - \\(\\frac{2}{5} = 0.4\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{7} \\approx 0.571\\).\n   - The mean should be between 0.4 and 0.571. \n\n2. **Calculate Decimal Equivalent of \\(\\frac{17}{35}\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{17}{35} = 0.4857\\ldots\n   \\]\n\n3. **Is 0.4857 between 0.4 and 0.571?**\n   - Yes, it lies within the range.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 4:**\nEverything checks out. The arithmetic mean is indeed \\(\\frac{17}{35}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe arithmetic mean of \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{7}\\) is \\(\\frac{17}{35}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection:**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Starting with the simple average method made sense because it\u2019s the standard way to find the mean. Considering converting to decimals was a valid strategy, but I preferred keeping it in fractions to maintain exactness.\n\n- **Exploring Different Methods:** Trying the weighted mean approach reinforced the correctness of the first method since both strategies yielded the same result.\n\n- **Checks and Verifications:** Regular reflection and quick checks throughout ensured that any potential missteps were caught early. It\u2019s crucial to verify each step, especially when dealing with fractions, to avoid cumulative errors.\n\n- **Final Thoughts:** Approaching the problem step by step, considering multiple strategies, and consistently checking work led to a confident and accurate solution.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** Brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and verifying each step is essential for solving mathematical problems accurately, mimicking natural human thinking.",
