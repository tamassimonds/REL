    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking my work along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed. It's important to brainstorm initially, reflect often, and make sure each step aligns with the goal.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem \\(16\\left(\\frac{125}{2}+\\frac{25}{4}+\\frac{9}{16}+1\\right)\\), my initial reaction is to simplify the expression inside the parentheses. It looks like a sum of fractions with different denominators and a whole number. This reminds me of adding like fractions or finding a common denominator, similar to problems I've encountered before.\n\nBut then I notice the \\(16\\) outside the parentheses, which indicates multiplication. So, I need to be careful\u2014perhaps simplifying the sum first makes the multiplication easier. Alternatively, distributing \\(16\\) across each term inside could also work. \n\nHmm, both methods could lead to the correct answer, but I'll explore simplifying inside the parentheses first to see if that feels more straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Simplify Inside the Parentheses First:**\n   - Add all the fractional terms together to find a single fraction.\n   - Multiply the result by \\(16\\).\n\n2. **Distribute \\(16\\) Across Each Term:**\n   - Multiply \\(16\\) by each term inside the parentheses individually.\n   - This might make the sum easier to compute without needing a common denominator.\n\nLet me start with the first strategy\u2014simplifying inside the parentheses. If that seems too cumbersome, I'll switch to distributing \\(16\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplifying Inside the Parentheses**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAdding fractions with different denominators requires finding a common denominator. Let's see if I can find one that works for all the terms: \\(\\frac{125}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{25}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{9}{16}\\), and \\(1\\).\n\n**Finding a Common Denominator:**\n\n- **Denominators:** 2, 4, 16, and the whole number \\(1\\) can be considered having a denominator of \\(1\\).\n\n- **Least Common Multiple (LCM):** The LCM of 2, 4, and 16 is 16.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, since 16 is the largest denominator, converting all fractions to have 16 as the denominator seems like a solid approach. Let's proceed with that.\n\n**Converting Each Term:**\n\n1. \\(\\frac{125}{2} = \\frac{125 \\times 8}{2 \\times 8} = \\frac{1000}{16}\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{25}{4} = \\frac{25 \\times 4}{4 \\times 4} = \\frac{100}{16}\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{9}{16}\\) (already in the correct form)\n4. \\(1 = \\frac{16}{16}\\)\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this conversion make sense? Yes, multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same number keeps the fraction equivalent.\n\n**Adding the Terms Together:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1000}{16} + \\frac{100}{16} + \\frac{9}{16} + \\frac{16}{16} = \\frac{1000 + 100 + 9 + 16}{16} = \\frac{1125}{16}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat seems correct\u2014adding the numerators gives \\(1125\\), and the denominator remains \\(16\\). \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Multiplying by \\(16\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, multiply the simplified fraction by \\(16\\) as per the original problem.\n\n\\[\n16 \\times \\frac{1125}{16} = \\frac{16 \\times 1125}{16}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Expression:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16 \\times 1125}{16} = 1125\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check if I did everything correctly. Multiplying by \\(16\\) cancels out the denominator, leaving just \\(1125\\). \n\n**Reflection:**  \nYes, the \\(16\\) in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, leaving the whole number \\(1125\\). This makes sense mathematically.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIs \\(1125\\) a reasonable answer? Thinking back, the initial fractions added up to a sizable fraction, and multiplying by \\(16\\) should indeed result in a large integer. \n\nAlright, everything checks out. But just to ensure, I'll briefly explore the second strategy\u2014distributing \\(16\\) across each term\u2014to confirm that this approach aligns with the first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring the Second Strategy\u2014Distributing \\(16\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's see if distributing \\(16\\) across each term inside the parentheses yields the same result.\n\n**Applying Distribution:**\n\n\\[\n16 \\times \\frac{125}{2} + 16 \\times \\frac{25}{4} + 16 \\times \\frac{9}{16} + 16 \\times 1\n\\]\n\n**Calculating Each Term:**\n\n1. \\(16 \\times \\frac{125}{2} = \\frac{2000}{2} = 1000\\)\n2. \\(16 \\times \\frac{25}{4} = \\frac{400}{4} = 100\\)\n3. \\(16 \\times \\frac{9}{16} = 9\\) (the \\(16\\) cancels with the denominator)\n4. \\(16 \\times 1 = 16\\)\n\n**Adding Them Together:**\n\n\\[\n1000 + 100 + 9 + 16 = 1125\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth strategies lead to the same result: \\(1125\\). This confirms the correctness of the initial approach. \n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this distribution make sense? Yes, distributing \\(16\\) ensures that each term is scaled appropriately, and adding them together gives the correct total.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Reflection**\n\n- **Consistency:** Both methods\u2014simplifying inside the parentheses first and distributing \\(16\\) across each term\u2014yield the same result: \\(1125\\).\n\n- **Reasonableness:** The final answer is a large integer, which aligns with the expectation given the original expression's components.\n\n- **Mistakes and Adjustments:** Initially, I considered starting with finding a common denominator, which worked well. Checking along the way confirmed that each step was correct. Exploring the alternative strategy reassured me of the validity of the solution.\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nTaking multiple approaches ensured accuracy and reinforced that the answer is indeed \\(1125\\). It's always good to reflect and check, especially when dealing with expressions involving fractions and multiplication.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming, exploring different strategies, and meticulously checking each step, the final answer is **\\(1125\\)**. Taking the time to reflect and verify ensures that the process is both correct and clear.",
