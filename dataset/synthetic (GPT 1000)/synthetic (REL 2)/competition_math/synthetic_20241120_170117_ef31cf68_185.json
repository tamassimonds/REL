    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and think it through step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it for the first time.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the question: **\"How many positive two-digit integers have an odd number of positive factors?\"**, a few things come to mind:\n\n- **Two-Digit Integers:** Okay, we're looking at numbers from 10 to 99. That's a finite range, so I can list them or use some properties of numbers.\n  \n- **Odd Number of Positive Factors:** This is interesting. I vaguely remember that numbers with an odd number of factors have something special about them. Maybe I learned that somewhere before, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\n- **Positive Factors:** Just the factors that are positive integers, so no negatives involved.\n\nInitially, I'm not sure why only certain numbers have an odd number of factors. My memory is a bit hazy, but I think it has to do with perfect squares? Let me brainstorm how to approach this.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **List All Two-Digit Numbers and Count Their Factors:**\n\n   - **Pros:** Direct approach, nothing fancy. Just list and count.\n   \n   - **Cons:** Time-consuming and tedious. Plus, there are 90 numbers to check!\n\n2. **Use the Property of Perfect Squares:**\n\n   - **Pros:** I recall that only perfect squares have an odd number of factors because their square roots are repeated factors.\n   \n   - **Cons:** Need to verify if this is correct and figure out which two-digit numbers are perfect squares.\n\n3. **Factorization Method:**\n\n   - **Pros:** Maybe factorizing each number could help identify a pattern or rule.\n   \n   - **Cons:** Still might end up being tedious; not clear if it would be faster than the listing method.\n\n4. **Mathematical Theorems or Patterns:**\n\n   - **Pros:** If there's a theorem related to factors, it might provide a quick solution.\n   \n   - **Cons:** Not sure what theorem applies here without doing some research or recalling from memory.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the Perfect Squares Strategy**\n\nLet me start by exploring the **Perfect Squares** idea since it's the one that rings a bell.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I remember that a number has an odd number of factors if and only if it is a **perfect square**. This is because factors usually come in pairs (like \\(a \\times b = n\\)), but in perfect squares, one factor is repeated (e.g., \\( \\sqrt{n} \\times \\sqrt{n} = n \\)).\n\n- So, if I can find all the two-digit perfect squares, those should be the numbers with an odd number of positive factors.\n\n**Action Step:**\n\n1. **Identify Two-Digit Perfect Squares:**\n\n   - Calculate the square roots of the smallest and largest two-digit numbers:\n     - Smallest two-digit number: 10 \u21d2 \\( \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.16 \\) \u21d2 Round up to 4\n     - Largest two-digit number: 99 \u21d2 \\( \\sqrt{99} \\approx 9.95 \\) \u21d2 Round down to 9\n\n2. **List the Perfect Squares from 4 to 9:**\n\n   - \\( 4^2 = 16 \\)\n   - \\( 5^2 = 25 \\)\n   - \\( 6^2 = 36 \\)\n   - \\( 7^2 = 49 \\)\n   - \\( 8^2 = 64 \\)\n   - \\( 9^2 = 81 \\)\n\nPause for Reflection: Does this make sense? Should there be more two-digit numbers with odd factors, or is this list complete?\n\nAnswer: Since we're only considering two-digit numbers, and I calculated the squares of integers from 4 to 9, this should cover all two-digit perfect squares. The range seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Completeness of the Approach**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **Range of Perfect Squares:** From \\(4^2\\) (16) to \\(9^2\\) (81), all results are two-digit numbers.\n  \n- **Count:** There are 6 numbers listed (16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81). Does that feel right?\n\n- **Two-Digit Range:** 10 to 99 includes 90 numbers total, so having 6 perfect squares seems reasonable.\n\n**Potential Issue:**\n\nWait, should there be more? But then, I remember that perfect squares are less frequent as numbers get larger, especially in the two-digit range.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Verifying with the Listing Method**\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider the **Listing All Two-Digit Numbers and Checking Their Factors** method as a backup.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- List all numbers from 10 to 99.\n  \n- For each number, count the number of positive factors.\n\n- See how many have an odd number of factors.\n\n**Action Step:**\n\n1. **Start Listing:**\n   - This is tedious, so maybe better to write a small program or do a few examples manually.\n\n2. **Sample Calculation:**\n\n   - Let's take a few random two-digit numbers to check:\n     - \\( 10 = 1, 2, 5, 10 \\) \u21d2 4 factors (even)\n     - \\( 11 = 1, 11 \\) \u21d2 2 factors (even)\n     - \\( 12 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 \\) \u21d2 6 factors (even)\n     - \\( 16 = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 \\) \u21d2 5 factors (odd) \u2705\n     - \\( 25 = 1, 5, 25 \\) \u21d2 3 factors (odd) \u2705\n   \nPause for Reflection: This is taking a while. Think about whether it's worth continuing with this method.\n\nAnswer: Probably not the most efficient way. The Perfect Squares approach seems more straightforward, especially since perfect squares are known to have an odd number of factors.\n\n---\n\n### **Finalizing the Approach**\n\nI've explored two main strategies:\n\n1. **Using Perfect Squares:**\n   - Quick and aligns with the mathematical property that only perfect squares have an odd number of factors.\n\n2. **Listing and Counting Factors:**\n   - Time-consuming and confirms what the Perfect Squares strategy suggests.\n\nGiven that the Perfect Squares method is more efficient and directly tied to the property of having an odd number of factors, I'll go with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Calculation Using Perfect Squares**\n\n**Action Step:**\n\n- **List of Two-Digit Perfect Squares:**\n  - \\( 4^2 = 16 \\)\n  - \\( 5^2 = 25 \\)\n  - \\( 6^2 = 36 \\)\n  - \\( 7^2 = 49 \\)\n  - \\( 8^2 = 64 \\)\n  - \\( 9^2 = 81 \\)\n\n- **Total Count:** There are 6 two-digit perfect squares.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\nThis makes sense. Each of these numbers has an odd number of positive factors because they're perfect squares.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection and Verification**\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Does the answer make sense in the context of the question?\n  \n- Have I considered all possible two-digit numbers?\n\n- Is there any other category of numbers I might have missed?\n\n**Verification:**\n\n- **Perfect Squares:** Confident that only these have an odd number of factors.\n  \n- **Two-Digit Range:** Checked that all listed numbers are within 10 to 99.\n\n- **Count:** Double-checked the list to ensure no perfect squares are missing.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Sample Perfect Squares:** 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81 \u21d2 All listed and within the two-digit range.\n\n- **Odd Number of Factors:** Each perfect square has an odd number of factors due to the repeated square root.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**How many positive two-digit integers have an odd number of positive factors?**\n\n**Answer:** **6**\n\n**Explanation:** There are six two-digit perfect squares (16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81), each of which has an odd number of positive factors.\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem step by step, exploring different strategies, and reflecting on each stage, I've arrived at the conclusion that there are **6** positive two-digit integers with an odd number of positive factors.
