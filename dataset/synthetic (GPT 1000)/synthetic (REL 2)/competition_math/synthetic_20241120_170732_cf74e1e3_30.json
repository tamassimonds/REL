    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a human-like thought process. I\u2019ll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work often, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn\u2019t seem right. Let's begin!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, my immediate reaction is to **clarify** what's being asked:\n\n- **Given:** A region \\( S \\) with an area of 10.\n- **Transformation:** Applying the matrix \n  \\[\n  \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 7 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\n  \\]\n  to \\( S \\) results in a new region \\( S' \\).\n- **Objective:** Find the area of \\( S' \\).\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Matrix Application:** This reminds me of how matrices transform geometric shapes in linear algebra. I recall that matrices can stretch, rotate, or skew regions in the plane.\n- **Area Change:** I vaguely remember that the area of the transformed region is related to the determinant of the matrix applied. But I\u2019m not entirely sure how to proceed.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** Maybe I could:\n  - Calculate the determinant of the matrix and see how it relates to the area.\n  - Explore properties of determinants concerning area transformations.\n  - Use examples with simpler matrices to build intuition.\n\nAt this point, I think **calculating the determinant** could be the key. Let\u2019s explore that further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Determinant of the Matrix**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI recall that the determinant of a 2x2 matrix is calculated using:\n\\[\n\\text{det}(\\mathbf{A}) = ad - bc\n\\]\nfor a matrix \n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Applying to Our Matrix:**\nGiven the matrix \n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 7 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nlet\u2019s compute the determinant:\n\n\\[\n\\text{det} = (2)(-3) - (1)(7) = -6 - 7 = -13\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, the determinant is **-13**. That\u2019s interesting because the area factor is the **absolute value** of the determinant. So, the area of \\( S' \\) will be scaled by a factor of 13, regardless of the sign.\n\n**Check:**\n- The calculation seems correct: \\( -6 - 7 = -13 \\).\n- Taking the absolute value makes sense for area scaling.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe area of \\( S' \\) is scaled by a factor of 13.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Scaling the Area of \\( S \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow, I need to apply this scaling factor to the original area of \\( S \\).\n\nGiven:\n- Original area \\( S = 10 \\)\n- Scaling factor from the determinant \\( | \\text{det} | = 13 \\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } S' = \\text{Original Area} \\times | \\text{det} | = 10 \\times 13 = 130\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems straightforward. By multiplying the original area by the absolute value of the determinant, I get the area of the transformed region.\n\n**Check:**\n- Multiplication: \\( 10 \\times 13 = 130 \\).\n- The scaling factor being 13 aligns with the determinant's absolute value.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe area of \\( S' \\) is **130**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, let me **double-check** if using the determinant to find the area scaling is indeed correct.\n\n**Recalling Concepts:**\n- From linear algebra, it's known that applying a transformation matrix to a geometric region scales the area by the determinant of the matrix.\n- The absolute value of the determinant represents the **scale factor** for area, regardless of whether the transformation includes a reflection (which would introduce a negative sign in the determinant).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Given that the determinant was calculated correctly and the scaling factor was applied appropriately, the approach seems solid.\n- No alternative methods are needed since the determinant provides a direct relation between the matrix and the area transformation.\n\n**Check:**\n- All calculations align logically with linear algebra principles.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe area of \\( S' \\) is confidently **130**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Understanding the Solution**\n\nLooking back, the initial uncertainty about how matrices affect area led me to recall fundamental linear algebra concepts. By:\n\n1. **Calculating the Determinant:** Identifying the area scaling factor.\n2. **Applying the Scale Factor to the Original Area:** Computing the new area.\n\nI arrived at the solution systematically. Checking each step ensured accuracy, and reflecting on the approach confirmed that using the determinant was the correct strategy all along.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{130}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step, human-like thought process provides clarity on solving the problem. By brainstorming, reflecting, checking work frequently, and being open to changing strategies, we can tackle mathematical challenges effectively.",
