    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect along the way, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's start by understanding the problem thoroughly.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so the problem is about a binary operation defined as \\( a \\star b = ab + 2b - a \\). We're given that \\( 5 \\star x = 37 \\), and we need to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This reminds me of operations involving multiplication and addition, perhaps similar to distributing terms or rearranging expressions.\n- I think I need to substitute \\( a = 5 \\) and \\( b = x \\) into the operation definition to set up an equation.\n- Maybe I can solve for \\( x \\) by isolating it on one side of the equation.\n\nBut before jumping in, let's **brainstorm** different strategies to tackle this.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Substitution and Solving for \\( x \\):**\n   - Substitute \\( a = 5 \\) and \\( b = x \\) into the operation definition.\n   - Set the equation equal to 37 and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Rewrite the Operation for Simplification:**\n   - Rearrange the operation definition to see if it simplifies or factors nicely.\n   - This might help make solving for \\( x \\) easier.\n\n3. **Check with Example Values:**\n   - Although \\( x \\) is unknown, perhaps plugging in some possible values could provide insight.\n   - However, since this is a specific equation, checking with example values might not be efficient.\n\n4. **Inverse Operation Approach:**\n   - Think about whether there's an inverse operation that could simplify finding \\( x \\).\n   - This seems less applicable here since the operation is not standard.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The **Direct Substitution** method seems straightforward. \n- **Rewriting the operation** might help if the equation doesn't simplify easily.\n- **Checking with example values** might take too long since we have a specific equation to solve.\n- The **Inverse Operation** idea doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nI think I'll start with **Direct Substitution**. If I run into issues, I'll consider rewriting the operation for simplification.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Direct Substitution**\n\nLet's substitute \\( a = 5 \\) and \\( b = x \\) into the operation definition:\n\n\\[\n5 \\star x = 5x + 2x - 5\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I replaced \\( a \\) with 5 and \\( b \\) with \\( x \\) in the operation formula.\n- Now, according to the problem, this expression equals 37.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n5x + 2x - 5 = 37\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This looks correct. I've set up the equation based on the definition.\n- Time to combine like terms and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Combine Like Terms**\n\nLet's simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n\\[\n(5x + 2x) - 5 = 37\n\\]\n\n\\[\n7x - 5 = 37\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Adding \\( 5x \\) and \\( 2x \\) gives \\( 7x \\).\n- Subtracting 5 from \\( 7x \\) leaves us with \\( 7x - 5 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The equation is now simpler and easier to solve for \\( x \\).\n- Let's move on to isolating \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Isolate \\( x \\)**\n\nNow, we'll add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n7x - 5 + 5 = 37 + 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n7x = 42\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- By adding 5 to both sides, the -5 and +5 cancel each other out.\n- This leaves \\( 7x = 42 \\), making it straightforward to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The equation is now purely in terms of \\( x \\).\n- Checking if \\( 42 \\div 7 = 6 \\) makes sense here.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solve for \\( x \\)**\n\nLet's divide both sides by 7 to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{42}{7} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Dividing both sides by 7 isolates \\( x \\).\n- Simple division confirms that \\( x = 6 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This seems correct. \n- However, let's **quickly verify** by substituting \\( x = 6 \\) back into the original operation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verification**\n\nLet's check if \\( 5 \\star 6 = 37 \\):\n\n\\[\n5 \\star 6 = 5(6) + 2(6) - 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 30 + 12 - 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 42 - 5 = 37\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Substituting \\( x = 6 \\) back into the operation confirms the result.\n- Everything checks out, as the left side equals the right side (37).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The verification step aligns with the given condition \\( 5 \\star x = 37 \\).\n- This reinforces that our solution \\( x = 6 \\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Rewriting the Operation**\n\nJust to explore another method, let's see if rewriting the operation makes it easier.\n\n**Rewriting the Operation:**\n\\[\na \\star b = ab + 2b - a\n\\]\n\\[\n= ab + 2b - a\n\\]\n\nWait, maybe factoring could help?\n\n\\[\n= b(a + 2) - a\n\\]\n\nBut then:\n\\[\n5 \\star x = b(5 + 2) - 5 = 7x - 5\n\\]\n\\[\n7x - 5 = 37 \\quad \\text{(same as before)}\n\\]\n\\[\n7x = 42\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 6\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Rewriting the operation didn't change the outcome.\n- It confirmed that the original approach was correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Sometimes looking at a problem from different angles can validate the solution.\n- In this case, both methods lead to the same answer, reinforcing its correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nLet's do a quick final check:\n\n- The original operation definition was applied correctly.\n- Substitution of \\( a = 5 \\) and \\( b = x \\) was accurate.\n- All steps (combining like terms, isolating \\( x \\), solving) were followed correctly.\n- Verification confirms the solution.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n- Everything aligns perfectly.\n- The value of \\( x \\) is indeed **6**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThrough brainstorming different strategies, starting with direct substitution, and verifying each step, we've determined that the value of \\( x \\) is **6**. Exploring alternative approaches validated our initial method, ensuring the solution's correctness. Reflecting and checking throughout the process helped catch any potential mistakes early, leading to a confident and accurate result.",
