    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were solving it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their viability, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem, I see that:\n\n- **Two concentric circles**: This means they share the same center, \\( C \\).\n- **Larger circle**: Radius \\( 10 \\).\n- **Smaller circle**: Radius \\( 6 \\).\n- **Objective**: Determine the **area of the ring** between these two circles.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Area Calculation**: I remember that the area of a circle is based on its radius squared times \\( \\pi \\). So maybe I can find the area of each circle separately and then subtract the area of the smaller circle from the larger one.\n  \n- **Difference of Areas**: This approach sounds straightforward: calculate the area difference between the two circles to find the area of the ring.\n\n- **Alternative Thinking**: Another way could be to think about the ring as an annulus and recall any formulas specific to that, but I'm pretty sure the area difference method is what\u2019s commonly used here.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n- **Strategy 1**: Calculate the area of both circles and subtract the smaller from the larger.\n  \n- **Strategy 2**: Use the formula for the area of an annulus (which I remember is the area of the outer circle minus the area of the inner circle).\n  \n- **Strategy 3**: Visualize the problem to ensure I'm considering the right areas\u2014though I think both strategies should yield the same result.\n\n**Reflection**: Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 essentially do the same thing\u2014find the area of the annulus by subtracting the inner circle's area from the outer circle's area. I\u2019ll go with Strategy 1, as it seems more direct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Area of the Larger Circle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I need to find the area of the larger circle with radius \\( 10 \\).\n- The formula for the area of a circle is \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{larger}} = \\pi \\times (10)^2 = \\pi \\times 100 = 100\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check**: \\( 10^2 = 100 \\) is correct, and multiplying by \\( \\pi \\) gives \\( 100\\pi \\). This seems right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Smaller Circle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, find the area of the smaller circle with radius \\( 6 \\).\n- Using the same formula \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{smaller}} = \\pi \\times (6)^2 = \\pi \\times 36 = 36\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check**: \\( 6^2 = 36 \\) is correct, and multiplying by \\( \\pi \\) gives \\( 36\\pi \\). This looks accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Area of the Ring**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To find the area of the ring between the two circles, subtract the area of the smaller circle from the area of the larger circle.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nA_{\\text{ring}} = A_{\\text{larger}} - A_{\\text{smaller}} = 100\\pi - 36\\pi = (100 - 36)\\pi = 64\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check**: \\( 100\\pi - 36\\pi = 64\\pi \\) is straightforward. This subtraction makes sense.\n- **Random Insight**: The area of the ring is \\( 64\\pi \\), which is a multiple of \\( \\pi \\). That\u2019s consistent with areas being proportional to \\( \\pi \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Result**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Before finalizing, let me double-check the calculations to ensure everything adds up.\n- Also, think if the method used is appropriate for this type of problem.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Calculation Review**: \n  - Larger circle area: \\( 100\\pi \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - Smaller circle area: \\( 36\\pi \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - Difference: \\( 64\\pi \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  \n- **Method Verification**:\n  - Subtracting the area of the smaller circle from the larger circle is a standard approach for finding the area of an annulus (ring-shaped region).\n  - The formula used and calculations performed align with mathematical principles.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- Everything checks out. The area of the ring between the two circles is indeed \\( 64\\pi \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter brainstorming different strategies, calculating the areas of both circles, and verifying the result, the area of the ring between the two concentric circles is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{64\\pi}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach, including reflections and checks along the way, ensures that the solution is both accurate and reliable.",
