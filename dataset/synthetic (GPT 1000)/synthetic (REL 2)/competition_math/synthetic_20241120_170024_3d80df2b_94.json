    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: finding the terminating decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{11}{125}\\).\n\n### Step 1: Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- When I see \\(\\frac{11}{125}\\), my immediate reaction is to recall that fractions with denominators that are powers of 10 (like \\(10\\), \\(100\\), \\(1000\\), etc.) result in terminating decimals. \n- \\(125\\) is not a power of \\(10\\), but I remember that \\(125\\) is \\(5^3\\). \n- There's something familiar here; I think I've dealt with fractions where the denominator is a power of \\(5\\) before.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n1. **Long Division:** Perform long division to convert the fraction into a decimal directly.\n2. **Simplify the Fraction:** See if there's a way to multiply the numerator and denominator to make the denominator a power of \\(10\\), then convert to decimal.\n3. **Decimal Equivalent of Common Fractions:** Recall or look up the decimal equivalent of common fractions.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Long division seems straightforward, but it might be a bit tedious.\n- Adjusting the fraction to have a denominator that's a power of \\(10\\) sounds interesting because it directly relates to terminating decimals.\n- Using a known decimal equivalent could be the quickest if I remember it correctly.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Let\u2019s start by attempting to adjust the fraction to have a denominator that\u2019s a power of \\(10\\). If that doesn't work out smoothly, I'll switch to long division.\n\n### Step 2: Attempting to Adjust the Fraction\n\n**Approach:**\n- Since \\(125 = 5^3\\), I want to see if multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^3 = 8\\) will convert the denominator to a power of \\(10\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{125} \\times \\frac{8}{8} = \\frac{11 \\times 8}{125 \\times 8} = \\frac{88}{1000}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- \\(1000\\) is \\(10^3\\), so \\(\\frac{88}{1000}\\) should definitely be a terminating decimal.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This seems promising because now the denominator is a power of \\(10\\). \n- But let me double-check: multiplying \\(125\\) by \\(8\\) gives \\(1000\\), and \\(11 \\times 8 = 88\\), which looks correct.\n\n**Decision:**\n- It appears that \\(\\frac{88}{1000}\\) is a valid transformation. Now, I'll convert this fraction into its decimal form.\n\n### Step 3: Converting \\(\\frac{88}{1000}\\) to Decimal\n\n**Approach:**\n- Since \\(\\frac{88}{1000}\\) directly corresponds to \\(0.088\\) (because the denominator is \\(1000\\), or \\(10^3\\)), this should be straightforward.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{88}{1000} = 0.088\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Breaking it down: \\(88\\) divided by \\(1000\\) shifts the decimal place three spots to the left.\n- That matches what I expected.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This makes sense. Adjusting the fraction to have a denominator of \\(1000\\) directly gives me the terminating decimal.\n- It seems like the initial strategy worked well.\n\n**Decision:**\n- The decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{11}{125}\\) is \\(0.088\\).\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Result with Long Division\n\n**Approach:**\n- To ensure accuracy, let's perform long division to divide \\(11\\) by \\(125\\) and see if we arrive at the same decimal.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Divide \\(11.000\\) by \\(125\\):\n    - \\(125\\) goes into \\(110\\) zero times, so place a \\(0\\).\n    - Bring down the next zero: \\(1100\\).\n    - \\(125\\) goes into \\(1100\\) six times (\\(125 \\times 6 = 750\\)).\n    - Subtract \\(750\\) from \\(1100\\): \\(1100 - 750 = 350\\).\n    - Bring down the next zero: \\(3500\\).\n    - \\(125\\) goes into \\(3500\\) twenty-eight times (\\(125 \\times 28 = 3500\\)).\n    - Subtract \\(3500\\) from \\(3500\\): \\(3500 - 3500 = 0\\).\n\n**Result:**\n\\[\n11 \\div 125 = 0.088\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The long division confirms that the decimal expansion is indeed \\(0.088\\).\n- This acts as a verification step, ensuring that the initial method was correct.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Both methods agree: the terminating decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{11}{125}\\) is \\(0.088\\).\n\n### Step 5: Final Reflection and Check\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Initially, I considered multiple strategies: adjusting the fraction to a power of \\(10\\) and using long division.\n- Adjusting the fraction worked seamlessly, providing an immediate answer.\n- Long division served as a verification step, confirming the result.\n\n**Check:**\n- To double-check, multiplying \\(0.088\\) by \\(125\\) should yield \\(11\\):\n    \\[\n    0.088 \\times 125 = 11\n    \\]\n- Calculation:\n        - \\(0.088 \\times 100 = 8.8\\)\n        - \\(0.088 \\times 25 = 2.2\\)\n        - \\(8.8 + 2.2 = 11\\)\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- The multiplication confirms that \\(0.088\\) is indeed the correct decimal expansion.\n- Everything aligns, and the result makes sense both mathematically and logically.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{125} = 0.088\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy exploring different strategies and verifying through multiple methods, I've confidently determined that the terminating decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{11}{125}\\) is \\(0.088\\). Throughout the process, checking and reflecting ensured the accuracy and correctness of the approach and the final result.",
