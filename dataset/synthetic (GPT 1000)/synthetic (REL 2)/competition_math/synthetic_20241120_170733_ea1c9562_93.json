    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work frequently, and reflecting to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's start by really unpacking the question.\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nThe problem states:  \n*\"If the ratio of \\( b \\) to \\( a \\) is 3, then what is the value of \\( a \\) when \\( b = 12 - 5a \\)?\"*\n\nInitially, I'm thinking:\n\n- **Ratios**: I remember that the ratio of \\( b \\) to \\( a \\) being 3 means that \\( \\frac{b}{a} = 3 \\). This is a key relationship.\n- **Equation**: There's another equation given: \\( b = 12 - 5a \\). This connects \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) directly.\n\nOkay, so we have two relationships:\n1. \\( \\frac{b}{a} = 3 \\)\n2. \\( b = 12 - 5a \\)\n\nMy goal is to find the value of \\( a \\).\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Substitution Method**:  \n   - Use the ratio \\( \\frac{b}{a} = 3 \\) to express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\).\n   - Substitute this expression into the second equation \\( b = 12 - 5a \\).\n\n2. **Cross-Multiplication**:  \n   - Since \\( \\frac{b}{a} = 3 \\), I could cross-multiply to express \\( b \\) and \\( a \\) in terms of each other.\n\n3. **Graphical Interpretation**:  \n   - Plot both equations to find the intersection point, which would give the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n   \n4. **Checking with Different Values**:  \n   - Try assuming some values for \\( a \\) to see if they satisfy both equations.\n\nWait, before proceeding, I notice that using substitution seems straightforward because we already have one equation directly relating \\( b \\) and \\( a \\). Cross-multiplication might not be necessary since \\( b \\) is already given in terms of \\( a \\). Graphical interpretation could work, but it's more time-consuming and not as precise for this problem. Checking with different values could confirm our solution but might not be efficient.\n\n**Decision**: Let's go with the **Substitution Method**. If it doesn't pan out, I'll reconsider.\n\n### **Step 1: Express \\( b \\) in Terms of \\( a \\) Using the Ratio**\n\nGiven the ratio \\( \\frac{b}{a} = 3 \\), I can express \\( b \\) as:\n\\[ \nb = 3a \n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: This seems correct because multiplying \\( a \\) by 3 gives \\( b \\), which aligns with the ratio provided.\n\n### **Step 2: Substitute \\( b = 3a \\) into the Second Equation**\n\nNow, substitute \\( b = 3a \\) into the equation \\( b = 12 - 5a \\):\n\\[ \n3a = 12 - 5a \n\\]\n\n**Thoughts**: At this point, I'm setting up an equation that only involves \\( a \\). This should allow me to solve for \\( a \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Solve for \\( a \\)**\n\nTo solve for \\( a \\), I need to get all terms involving \\( a \\) on one side of the equation. Let's add \\( 5a \\) to both sides:\n\\[ \n3a + 5a = 12 \n\\]\n\\[ \n8a = 12 \n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 8 to isolate \\( a \\):\n\\[ \na = \\frac{12}{8} \n\\]\n\\[ \na = \\frac{3}{2} \n\\]\n\n**Check**:  \n- Does \\( a = \\frac{3}{2} \\) make sense in the context of the problem?\n- It seems reasonable because \\( a \\) is a scalar quantity, and \\( \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\), which is a valid value.\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Solution**\n\nBefore concluding, let's verify that \\( b \\) also satisfies the given condition. We found \\( a = \\frac{3}{2} \\), so let's calculate \\( b \\):\n\nUsing \\( b = 3a \\):\n\\[ \nb = 3 \\times \\frac{3}{2} \n\\]\n\\[ \nb = \\frac{9}{2} \n\\]\n\\[ \nb = 4.5 \n\\]\n\nNow, let's check if this \\( b \\) satisfies the second equation \\( b = 12 - 5a \\):\n\n\\[ \n12 - 5a = 12 - 5 \\times \\frac{3}{2} \n\\]\n\\[ \n= 12 - \\frac{15}{2} \n\\]\n\\[ \n= 12 - 7.5 \n\\]\n\\[ \n= 4.5 \n\\]\n\n**Conclusion**: Both methods yield \\( b = 4.5 \\), which matches our earlier calculation. This confirms that our solution is correct.\n\n### **Alternative Reflection**\n\nInitially, I considered using cross-multiplication or checking with different values, but substituting \\( b = 3a \\) into the second equation directly provided a straightforward path to the solution. If I had attempted cross-multiplication, it might have complicated things unnecessarily since \\( b \\) was already given in terms of \\( a \\).\n\nSimilarly, checking with different values could have verified the solution but would have been less efficient. By following the substitution method, I was able to arrive at the solution quickly and confirm its correctness through verification.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully substituting and verifying, the value of \\( a \\) is:\n\n\\[ \na = \\frac{3}{2} \\text{ or } 1.5 \n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts**: Throughout the process, reflecting on each step ensured that I remained on the correct path. By choosing a method that directly aligned with the given relationships and verifying the solution, I was able to confidently arrive at the correct answer.",
