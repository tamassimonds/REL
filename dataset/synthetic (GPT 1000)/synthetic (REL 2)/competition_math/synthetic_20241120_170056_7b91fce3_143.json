    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. First, I'll brainstorm how to approach it, explore different strategies, check if each method makes sense, and adjust as needed. I'll write out my thought process just like I would naturally think through a problem, including initial reflections, possible dead ends, and \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**User Query:**\nWe have a graph of \\( y = a \\sin bx \\) with constants \\( a < 0 \\) and \\( b > 0 \\). We need to find the value of \\( a \\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- This looks like a sine function, which typically oscillates between -1 and 1. \n- However, since \\( a < 0 \\), the amplitude is negative, meaning the graph is reflected across the x-axis.\n- The parameter \\( b > 0 \\) affects the period of the sine function.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- I remember that for a sine function, the amplitude is determined by the coefficient \\( a \\).\n- The period is influenced by \\( b \\). Specifically, the standard period of \\( \\sin x \\) is \\( 2\\pi \\), so \\( \\sin bx \\) would have a period of \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{b} \\).\n- Since \\( a < 0 \\), the maximum value of the function will be \\( a \\) (which is negative) and the minimum will be \\( 0 \\).\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- The graph should oscillate between \\( a \\) and \\( 0 \\), which is somewhat unusual since typical sine functions oscillate between -1 and 1. \n- I'm curious how this affects the appearance of the graph.\n\n**Next Step:**\n- I need to identify the amplitude and possibly the period by examining the graph. Let's see if I can spot any key features like maximum and minimum points.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing the Graph**\n\n**Observation:**\n- **Y-Intercept:** The graph intersects the y-axis at \\( y = -2 \\).\n- **Maxima and Minima:** The graph oscillates between \\( -2 \\) and \\( 0 \\).\n\n**First Reactions:**\n- Since the minimum value is \\( 0 \\), and the maximum is \\( -2 \\), it seems the amplitude \\( |a| = 2 \\).\n- Wait, but typically, the maximum value of a sine function is the amplitude, so having \\( -2 \\) as the maximum value is a bit confusing since \\( a < 0 \\).\n\n**Realization:**\n- Oh! I see. The sine function oscillates between the minimum and maximum values. Since \\( a < 0 \\), the graph is reflected, making the maximum value \\( a \\) and the minimum \\( 0 \\).\n- So, if the maximum is \\( -2 \\), \\( a = -2 \\).\n\n**Validation:**\n- The graph indeed oscillates between \\( -2 \\) and \\( 0 \\), with \\( -2 \\) being the highest point.\n- This makes sense because the sine function is reflected across the x-axis due to \\( a < 0 \\).\n\n**Next Step:**\n- Just to be sure, let me double-check if the amplitude corresponds to \\( |a| = 2 \\) and if the period aligns with the value of \\( b \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Confirming the Amplitude and Period**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- For a sine function \\( y = a \\sin bx \\), the amplitude is given by \\( |a| \\).\n- The graph oscillates between \\( -|a| \\) and \\( 0 \\) when \\( a < 0 \\).\n- The period is \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{b} \\).\n\n**Checking Amplitude:**\n- From the graph, the maximum value is \\( -2 \\) and the minimum is \\( 0 \\).\n- Hence, the amplitude \\( |a| = 2 \\).\n- Since \\( a < 0 \\), \\( a = -2 \\).\n\n**Checking Period:**\n- Let's see how many units the graph takes to complete one full oscillation (from maximum to minimum and back to maximum).\n- If the amplitude is 2, the distance between the maximum and minimum would be twice the amplitude, so \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\).\n- However, since it's a sine function, the period should be \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{b} \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Hmm, I'm not seeing clear evidence of the period being \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{b} \\) directly on the graph. Perhaps the scaling is different or the graph extends beyond one period.\n- This makes me think that the value of \\( b \\) might be larger or the graph is zoomed out.\n\n**Next Step:**\n- Instead of focusing too much on the period, which isn't clearly visible, I'll proceed with the amplitude confirmation since it's more directly related to finding \\( a \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finalizing the Value of \\( a \\)**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Based on the observations:\n  - The graph oscillates between \\( -2 \\) and \\( 0 \\).\n  - The maximum value is \\( -2 \\), which corresponds to the value of \\( a \\) since \\( a < 0 \\).\n  \n**Final Calculation:**\n\\[\na = -2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This value makes sense given the graph's behavior.\n- The negative amplitude indicates a reflection across the x-axis, aligning with the graph's oscillation between \\( -2 \\) and \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Does \\( a = -2 \\) satisfy all conditions?\n  - Yes, \\( a < 0 \\) is satisfied.\n  - The graph oscillates between \\( -2 \\) and \\( 0 \\), consistent with \\( a = -2 \\).\n\n**Next Step:**\n- Since the value of \\( a \\) is confirmed, I don't need to explore further strategies. The initial approach via graph analysis was effective.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n- Exploring different strategies helped clarify the role of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n- Initially, the period wasn't as apparent, but focusing on the amplitude provided a clear path to the solution.\n- Checking the work at each step ensured that the final answer aligns with the graph's characteristics.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\na = -2\n\\]",
