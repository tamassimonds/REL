    "working_out": "Absolutely! Let's dive into this problem by emulating human-like thinking and problem-solving. We'll brainstorm various strategies, reflect on their validity, make adjustments if needed, and continuously check our progress to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem:\n\\[ (1 - \\omega + \\omega^2)^4 + (1 + \\omega - \\omega^2)^4 \\]\nwhere \\(\\omega\\) is a nonreal root of \\(x^3 = 1\\), I think:\n\n- **Familiar Concepts**: This reminds me of working with roots of unity. I recall that the roots of \\(x^3 = 1\\) are all cube roots of unity, including the complex ones.\n  \n- **Possible Strategies**:\n  - **Expanding Binomials**: Maybe expanding both terms using the binomial theorem could work, but that might get messy.\n  - **Using Properties of Roots of Unity**: Leveraging the properties of \\(\\omega\\) (like \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\) and \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\)) might simplify things.\n  - **Symmetry and Patterns**: Looking for symmetry or patterns between the two terms could help.\n  \n- **Initial Brainstorm**: I'm leaning towards using properties of roots of unity because expanding binomials seems cumbersome. But I'm not entirely sure if that alone will be sufficient. Let me explore this direction further.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Using Properties of Roots of Unity**\n\n**Recall:**  \nThe roots of \\(x^3 = 1\\) are \\(1, \\omega, \\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega\\) and \\omega^2\\) are the nonreal roots. We know:\n- \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\)\n- \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\) (sum of roots is zero)\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, I remember that \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\) are complex conjugates. This might help in simplifying the expressions.\n\n**Approach:**  \n- Substitute \\(\\omega^2 = -1 - \\omega\\) (from \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\)) into the given expression.\n  \n**Applying the Substitution:**\n\n1. **Substituting in the First Term:**\n   \\[\n   1 - \\omega + \\omega^2 = 1 - \\omega + (-1 - \\omega) = 1 - \\omega - 1 - \\omega = -2\\omega\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substituting in the Second Term:**\n   \\[\n   1 + \\omega - \\omega^2 = 1 + \\omega - (-1 - \\omega) = 1 + \\omega + 1 + \\omega = 2 + 2\\omega\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis substitution seems straightforward. By expressing \\(\\omega^2\\) in terms of \\(\\omega\\), the original expression simplifies significantly.\n\n---\n\n### **Simplified Expression**\n\nNow our original problem becomes:\n\\[\n(-2\\omega)^4 + (2 + 2\\omega)^4\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this look correct? Let's recap:\n- The substitution was based on the relation \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\).\n- This relation is fundamental to cube roots of unity, so I believe the substitution is valid.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that the expression is simplified, I can proceed with calculating the powers. However, I notice that factoring might help to simplify further before expanding.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Factoring the Simplified Expression**\n\n**Idea:**  \nFactor out common terms to make expansion easier.\n\n1. **Factor Out Constants:**\n   \\[\n   (-2\\omega)^4 = (-2)^4 \\cdot \\omega^4 = 16\\omega^4\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   (2 + 2\\omega)^4 = 2^4 \\cdot (1 + \\omega)^4 = 16(1 + \\omega)^4\n   \\]\n\n   So,\n   \\[\n   (-2\\omega)^4 + (2 + 2\\omega)^4 = 16\\omega^4 + 16(1 + \\omega)^4 = 16(\\omega^4 + (1 + \\omega)^4)\n   \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes factoring like this make sense? By pulling out the common factor, the expression looks cleaner. But I need to ensure that \\(\\omega^4\\) and \\((1 + \\omega)^4\\) are manageable.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nPerhaps I can simplify \\(\\omega^4\\) using \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), so \\(\\omega^4 = \\omega\\). Let's see if this works.\n\n---\n\n### **Simplifying \\(\\omega^4\\)**\n\n**Recall:**  \nSince \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), multiplying both sides by \\(\\omega\\) gives:\n\\[\n\\omega^4 = \\omega \\cdot \\omega^3 = \\omega \\cdot 1 = \\omega\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nThis substitution seems correct because raising \\(\\omega\\) to 3 gives 1, and multiplying by \\(\\omega\\) yields \\(\\omega\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow, the expression inside the parentheses becomes:\n\\[\n\\omega + (1 + \\omega)^4\n\\]\nI still need to expand \\((1 + \\omega)^4\\). This might take some time, but let's proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Expanding \\((1 + \\omega)^4\\) Using the Binomial Theorem**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nRecalling the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\n\\]\nFor \\((1 + \\omega)^4\\):\n- \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = \\omega\\), \\(n = 4\\)\n\nLet's write it out:\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega)^4 = \\binom{4}{0} 1^4 \\omega^0 + \\binom{4}{1} 1^3 \\omega^1 + \\binom{4}{2} 1^2 \\omega^2 + \\binom{4}{3} 1^1 \\omega^3 + \\binom{4}{4} 1^0 \\omega^4\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 + 4\\omega + 6\\omega^2 + 4\\omega^3 + \\omega^4\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Using \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\):**\n\\[\n= 1 + 4\\omega + 6\\omega^2 + 4(1) + \\omega\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 + 4\\omega + 6\\omega^2 + 4 + \\omega\n\\]\n\\[\n= 5 + 5\\omega + 6\\omega^2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nIs this simplification correct? Let's verify:\n- \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), so multiplying 4 by \\(\\omega^3\\) gives 4.\n- Adding coefficients seems accurate.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe expansion looks correct. Now, substituting back into the expression, we have:\n\\[\n\\omega + (5 + 5\\omega + 6\\omega^2) = \\omega + 5 + 5\\omega + 6\\omega^2 = 5 + 6\\omega + 6\\omega^2\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nCombining like terms makes sense. The expression now is:\n\\[\n5 + 6\\omega + 6\\omega^2\n\\]\nGiven that \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\) (from \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\)), we can simplify further.\n\n---\n\n### **Simplifying the Expression Using \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSubstitute \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\) into the expression:\n\\[\n5 + 6\\omega + 6\\omega^2 = 5 + 6(\\omega + \\omega^2)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 5 + 6(-1) = 5 - 6 = -1\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nIs this substitution correct? Yes, because \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\), so multiplying by 6 and adding 5 yields \\(-1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis simplification works beautifully. The expression inside the parentheses now evaluates to \\(-1\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expression**\n\nReturning to our factored expression:\n\\[\n16(\\omega^4 + (1 + \\omega)^4) = 16(\\omega + (1 + \\omega)^4) = 16(-1) = -16\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Let's recap:\n- We simplified \\((1 - \\omega + \\omega^2)^4\\) and \\((1 + \\omega - \\omega^2)^4\\) to \\(16(\\omega + (1 + \\omega)^4)\\).\n- By substituting known relationships among the roots of unity, the expression reduced to \\(-1\\).\n- Multiplying by 16 gives the final answer of \\(-16\\).\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nEvery step checks out. The use of properties of roots of unity streamlined the process, avoiding messy binomial expansions.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Verification Through Expansion**\n\n**Idea:**  \nEven though our previous approach seems correct, verifying by expanding the original expression fully ensures accuracy.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nExpanding \\((1 - \\omega + \\omega^2)^4\\) and \\((1 + \\omega - \\omega^2)^4\\) directly using the binomial theorem would be tedious. Given that our simpler method worked well, I might skip this step for now but keep it in mind if there's a doubt.\n\n**Check:**  \nWait, does this mean I should trust my initial approach completely? While I believe it's correct, in a real exam scenario, if time allows, expanding would confirm the result. However, given the consistent checks throughout, I'm confident in the answer.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe initial method, supported by multiple checks, leads to a consistent conclusion. It's essential to ensure each substitution and simplification aligns with known properties, which we've done.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, simplifying using properties of roots of unity, and continuously checking each step, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-16}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy brainstorming and initially considering multiple strategies, we opted for leveraging the properties of roots of unity, which efficiently simplified the problem. Throughout the process, reflecting and verifying each step ensured correctness. This human-like approach, with natural checks and adjustments, led us to the final answer confidently.\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps in understanding how to think through and solve such problems step by step!",
