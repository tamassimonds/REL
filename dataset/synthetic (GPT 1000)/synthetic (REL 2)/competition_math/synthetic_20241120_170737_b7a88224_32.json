I'll take you through my thought process step-by-step, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, checking my work, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like I would if I were solving it on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nOkay, so the problem asks me to fully factor the expression \\(2x^2 - 8\\). Immediately, I recognize that this looks like a quadratic expression, which reminds me of factoring polynomials I've done before. **Wait**, I remember that factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) is usually a good starting point with such expressions. But let me brainstorm a bit more to see if there are other strategies I can consider.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Factor out the GCF:** This seems like a straightforward starting point.\n- **Difference of squares:** I recall that \\(a^2 - b^2\\) factors into \\((a - b)(a + b)\\). Maybe this expression fits that mold?\n- **Quadratic formula:** If factoring doesn't work neatly, I could always apply the quadratic formula to find roots, but ideally, I want to stick to factoring.\n- **Completing the square:** Another method, though it might be more involved than necessary here.\n\n**Reflection:**\nGiven that \\(2x^2 - 8\\) has only two terms, the **difference of squares** method seems promising. **But**, I also see that there's a common factor in both terms, so perhaps starting with the **GCF** would be the most straightforward approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring the GCF**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet\u2019s start by looking for the greatest common factor among the terms \\(2x^2\\) and \\(-8\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Coefficients:** The numbers are 2 and -8. The GCF of 2 and 8 is **2**.\n- **Variable part:** Only \\(2x^2\\) has an \\(x\\) term, so we can factor out \\(x^2\\).\n\n**Factoring Out the GCF:**\n\\[\n2x^2 - 8 = 2(x^2 - 4)\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait, let me quickly verify. If I distribute \\(2\\) back to \\(x^2 - 4\\), do I get the original expression?\n\\[\n2 \\times x^2 = 2x^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2 \\times (-4) = -8\n\\]\n**Yes, that checks out.**\n\n**Reflection:**\nFactoring out the GCF is a solid first step. Now, I see that the remaining expression \\(x^2 - 4\\) looks familiar\u2014it's a **difference of squares**. **Oh!** This reminds me that I can factor it further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Difference of Squares**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I've factored out the GCF, I have \\(2(x^2 - 4)\\). I recognize that \\(x^2 - 4\\) fits the difference of squares formula: \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\).\n\n**Identifying \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):**\n- Here, \\(a^2 = x^2\\), so \\(a = x\\).\n- \\(b^2 = 4\\), so \\(b = 2\\).\n\n**Factoring \\(x^2 - 4\\):**\n\\[\nx^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)\n\\]\n\n**Putting It All Together:**\n\\[\n2(x^2 - 4) = 2(x - 2)(x + 2)\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nLet me verify by expanding back:\n\\[\n2(x - 2)(x + 2) = 2[(x - 2)(x + 2)] = 2(x^2 - 4) = 2x^2 - 8\n\\]\n**It matches the original expression!**\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis approach worked well. By first removing the GCF, I simplified the expression and then applied the difference of squares to factor it completely. **Hmm**, I\u2019m feeling confident about this solution, but let\u2019s double-check to ensure there are no mistakes.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Double-Checking the Work**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIs there another method that could arrive at the same solution? Would applying the quadratic formula or completing the square yield the same factors? Testing different strategies can help confirm the correctness of my current approach.\n\n**Examining the Difference of Squares Again:**\n\\[\nx^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)\n\\]\n**Quick Check:**\nDoes \\(x^2 - 4\\) really equal \\((x - 2)(x + 2)\\)?\n\\[\n(x - 2)(x + 2) = x^2 + 2x - 2x - 4 = x^2 - 4\n\\]\n**Yes, it simplifies back correctly.**\n\n**Alternative Method \u2013 Quadratic Formula:**\nThough I think factoring directly worked well, let\u2019s see if the quadratic formula arrives at the same factors.\n\n**Quadratic Formula Recall:**\nFor \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the solutions are:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n**Setting Up:**\nBut my original expression is \\(2x^2 - 8 = 0\\). Let\u2019s reframe it:\n\\[\n2x^2 - 8 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x^2 = 4\n\\]\n**Applying the Quadratic Formula:**\nHere, \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 0\\), \\(c = -8\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-0 \\pm \\sqrt{0^2 - 4(2)(-8)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{\\pm \\sqrt{64}}{4} = \\frac{\\pm 8}{4} = \\pm 2\n\\]\n**Interpreting the Solutions:**\nThe roots are \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = -2\\). Therefore, the factored form is:\n\\[\n(x - 2)(x + 2)\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\nInteresting! Both methods lead to the same factors, reinforcing that the factoring approach was correct. It\u2019s always good to cross-check using different strategies to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finalizing the Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nGiven that both methods arrive at the same solution, I can confidently conclude that the expression is fully factored as:\n\\[\n2(x - 2)(x + 2)\n\\]\n**Final Check:**\nLet me expand once more to ensure everything aligns:\n\\[\n2(x - 2)(x + 2) = 2[(x - 2)(x + 2)] = 2(x^2 - 4) = 2x^2 - 8\n\\]\n**It checks out perfectly.**\n\n**Final Reflection:**\nThrough exploring different strategies\u2014factoring out the GCF and applying the difference of squares, then verifying with the quadratic formula\u2014I\u2019ve confirmed that the expression \\(2x^2 - 8\\) fully factors to \\(2(x - 2)(x + 2)\\). It\u2019s always beneficial to brainstorm multiple approaches and validate with alternative methods to ensure the solution's correctness.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe fully factored form of the expression \\(2x^2 - 8\\) is:\n\\[\n2(x - 2)(x + 2)\n\\]\nBy starting with the GCF and recognizing the difference of squares, I was able to factor the expression efficiently. Checking the work with the quadratic formula provided additional confirmation, ensuring the solution is accurate.",
