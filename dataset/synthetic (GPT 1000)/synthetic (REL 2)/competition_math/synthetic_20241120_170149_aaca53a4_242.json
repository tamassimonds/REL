    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and explore it like a human would, complete with brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and possibly changing strategies along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I see the question \"What is the period of \\( y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\)?\", my initial reaction is to recall what I know about the tangent function and its period.\n\n- **Recall:** The standard tangent function, \\( y = \\tan x \\), has a period of \\( \\pi \\). I remember that altering the argument of the tangent function usually affects its period.\n  \n- **Related Concepts:** I know that other trigonometric functions like sine and cosine have their own periods, and transformations like \\( \\frac{x}{k} \\) can stretch or compress the period.\n\nBut then I think, \"Wait, the question involves \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) inside the tangent. How does that modify the period?\"\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Exploring Different Approaches:**\n\n1. **Recall the Standard Period of Tangent:**\n   - Start with the basic knowledge that \\( \\tan x \\) has a period of \\( \\pi \\).\n   \n2. **Effect of the Coefficient in the Argument:**\n   - Consider how the \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) affects the period. Maybe substituting \\( x \\) with \\( \\frac{x}{k} \\) changes the period by \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Graphical Approach:**\n   - Think about sketching the graph of \\( y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\) to visually identify the period.\n\n4. **Mathematical Definition of Period:**\n   - Review the formal definition of the period of a function and see how it applies here.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nGiven that I can't remember the exact impact of \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) on the period, perhaps the second approach\u2014considering how the coefficient in the argument modifies the period\u2014might be the most straightforward. But maybe a combination of these strategies would work best.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the First Strategy\u2014Recalling the Standard Period**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI know that the standard tangent function has a period of \\( \\pi \\). Now, I need to see how \\( \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\) differs from \\( \\tan x \\).\n\n- **Wait a Minute:** If the standard period is \\( \\pi \\), and the argument is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\), does that mean the period doubles? That seems plausible because \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) would stretch the graph horizontally.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet's hypothesize that the period of \\( y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\) is \\( 2\\pi \\). This makes sense because dividing \\( x \\) by 2 in the argument would stretch the period by a factor of 2.\n\n- **Hypothetical Period:** \\( T = 2\\pi \\)\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this align with what I know?\n\n- **Quick Check:** Yes, stretching the period by a factor of 2 would mean the function repeats every \\( 2\\pi \\) radians, which seems reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion of This Step:**\n\nSo far, it seems plausible that the period is \\( 2\\pi \\). But I should verify this with another approach to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Applying the Second Strategy\u2014Effect of the Coefficient in the Argument**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's formalize the idea. Typically, for trigonometric functions:\n\n- **Sine and Cosine:** The period \\( T = 2\\pi \\) by default. If \\( y = \\sin(kx) \\) or \\( y = \\cos(kx) \\), the period becomes \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{k} \\).\n  \n- **Tangent and Cotangent:** The period \\( T = \\pi \\) by default. If \\( y = \\tan(kx) \\) or \\( y = \\cot(kx) \\), the period becomes \\( \\frac{\\pi}{k} \\).\n\n**Applying to Our Function:**\n\n- Given \\( y = \\tan\\frac{x}{2} \\), we can think of it as \\( y = \\tan(kx) \\) where \\( k = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n  \n- According to the rule, the period \\( T \\) should be \\( \\frac{\\pi}{k} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\pi \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis aligns with our earlier hypothesis. It reinforces the idea that the period is indeed \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Logical Check:** Dividing \\( x \\) by 2 stretches the graph horizontally, so it makes sense the period would double.\n\n- **Numerical Check:** Calculation confirms \\( T = 2\\pi \\).\n\n**Conclusion of This Step:**\n\nBoth strategies lead to the same conclusion: the period of \\( y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\) is \\( 2\\pi \\). This consistency gives me more confidence in the result.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying with a Graphical Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo be absolutely certain, let's consider what the graph of \\( y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\) would look like.\n\n- **Comparison with Standard Tangent:** The standard \\( y = \\tan x \\) has asymptotes at odd multiples of \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) (i.e., \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\frac{5\\pi}{2}, \\ldots \\)).\n\n- **Modification by \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\):** Dividing \\( x \\) by 2 means the asymptotes occur at even multiples of \\( \\pi \\) (i.e., \\( \\pi, 2\\pi, 3\\pi, \\ldots \\)).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **Impact on Period:** Since the asymptotes are now spaced \\( 2\\pi \\) apart, this confirms that the period of the function is indeed \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Graphical Confirmation:** Observing the spacing of the asymptotes aligns with a \\( 2\\pi \\) period.\n\n**Conclusion of This Step:**\n\nThe graphical approach supports our earlier findings. The period is \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Reflecting on the Approach and Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that we've used multiple strategies\u2014recalling standard periods, applying the coefficient rule, and confirming graphically\u2014it's time to reflect and ensure everything aligns.\n\n- **Does Everything Make Sense?** Yes, all approaches consistently lead to a period of \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\n- **Could There Be an Error?** No apparent contradictions or miscalculations have arisen.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** All calculations and logical steps are consistent.\n\n- **Deeper Reflection:** The methods used are standard for determining the period of trigonometric functions. No shortcuts or assumptions were made that could introduce error.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying through graphical analysis, and ensuring consistency across methods, the period of \\( y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\) is **\\( 2\\pi \\)**.\n\n---\n\n**Recap of the Thought Process:**\n\n- **Started by Recollecting Basic Knowledge:** Recognized the standard period of the tangent function.\n\n- **Brainstormed Different Approaches:** Considered several methods to confirm the period.\n\n- **Applied Strategies Sequentially:** Used recalling standard periods, applying the coefficient rule, and validating with a graphical approach.\n\n- **Checked and Reflected Often:** Ensured each step aligned and no contradictions existed.\n\n- **Concluded with Confidence:** Multiple consistent results confirmed the period is \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\nFollowing this human-like thinking, with brainstorming, checking, reflecting, and adjusting the approach as needed, led us to the correct and confident solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe period of \\( y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2} \\) is **\\( 2\\pi \\)**.",
