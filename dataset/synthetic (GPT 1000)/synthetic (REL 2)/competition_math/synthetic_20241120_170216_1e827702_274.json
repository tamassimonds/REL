The height is given by the equation\n\n\\[\nh = 45 - 7t - 6t^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( t \\) is the time in seconds. \n\nRight off the bat, this looks like a quadratic equation because of the \\( t^2 \\) term. Quadratic equations often require solving for \\( t \\) using methods like factoring, the quadratic formula, or perhaps graphing.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Quadratic Equation Solving:**\n   - Set \\( h = 25 \\) and rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form.\n   - Use the quadratic formula to find the roots.\n   \n2. **Graphing the Equation:**\n   - Plot the equation \\( h = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 \\) and visually check where \\( h = 25 \\).\n   \n3. **Factoring the Quadratic:**\n   - Attempt to factor the rearranged equation if possible.\n   \n4. **Checking for Symmetry or Patterns:**\n   - See if there's a pattern or symmetry that could simplify the problem.\n\n**Which Approach to Start With?**\n\nHonestly, factoring seems like a good first attempt because if it works, it's usually the simplest method. If that doesn't pan out, I can revert to the quadratic formula.\n\n### Step 2: Attempting to Factor the Quadratic Equation\n\n**First Approach: Factoring**\n\nLet\u2019s start by setting \\( h = 25 \\):\n\n\\[\n25 = 45 - 7t - 6t^2\n\\]\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\n\\[\n0 = 45 - 7t - 6t^2 - 25\n\\]\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n\\[\n0 = 20 - 7t - 6t^2\n\\]\n\nRearranging to standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[\n6t^2 + 7t - 20 = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this. I\u2019m looking for two numbers that multiply to \\( 6 \\times (-20) = -120 \\) and add up to \\( 7 \\). \n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMultiplying to -120 and adding to 7? Let me list out possible pairs:\n\n- \\( 1 \\times -120 = -120 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\times -60 = -120 \\)\n- \\( 3 \\times -40 = -120 \\)\n- \\( 4 \\times -30 = -120 \\)\n- \\( 5 \\times -24 = -120 \\)\n- \\( 6 \\times -20 = -120 \\)\n- \\( 8 \\times -15 = -120 \\)\n- \\( 10 \\times -12 = -120 \\)\n- \\( -1 \\times 120 = -120 \\)\n\nWait, let me flip the signs since I need positive 7, so I\u2019m looking for negative pairs.\n\nMaybe \\( -8 \\times 15 = -120 \\) and \\( -8 + 15 = 7 \\). That could work.\n\n**Factoring the Quadratic:**\n\nSo, I can rewrite the middle term using these numbers:\n\n\\[\n6t^2 - 8t + 15t - 20 = 0\n\\]\n\nGrouping the terms:\n\n\\[\n(6t^2 - 8t) + (15t - 20) = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring out common terms in each group:\n\n\\[\n2t(3t - 4) + 5(3t - 4) = 0\n\\]\n\nWait, both groups have a common factor of \\( (3t - 4) \\):\n\n\\[\n(2t + 5)(3t - 4) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks promising. I factored the quadratic equation into \\( (2t + 5)(3t - 4) = 0 \\). Now, I can solve for \\( t \\) by setting each factor to zero.\n\n### Step 3: Solving the Factored Equation\n\n**Solving for \\( t \\):**\n\nSet each factor to zero:\n\n1. \\( 2t + 5 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( 3t - 4 = 0 \\)\n\n**First Equation:**\n\\[\n2t + 5 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2t = -5 \\Rightarrow t = -\\frac{5}{2} = -2.5 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n**Second Equation:**\n\\[\n3t - 4 = 0 \\Rightarrow 3t = 4 \\Rightarrow t = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nWait a second, I got two solutions: \\( t = -2.5 \\) seconds and \\( t = \\frac{4}{3} \\) seconds. Now, having a negative time doesn't make physical sense in this context\u2014time cannot be negative after the ball is thrown. So, the only valid solution is:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ seconds} \\approx 1.33 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI must have made an error or misinterpretation to receive a negative time. But upon reflection, in the context of the problem, only the positive time \\( t = \\frac{4}{3} \\) seconds aligns with when the ball reaches 25 feet after being thrown.\n\n**Possible Missteps:**\n\nWas there a mistake in factoring? Reviewing the factoring process, it seems correct. The original equation was successfully factored into two linear equations, leading to the correct solutions.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nIf there was doubt about the factoring method, the quadratic formula could be used as a verification step. But since factoring worked here, I\u2019ll stick with it.\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Solution\n\n**Quick Verification:**\n\nLet\u2019s plug \\( t = \\frac{4}{3} \\) seconds back into the original height equation to ensure it gives \\( h = 25 \\) feet.\n\n\\[\nh = 45 - 7\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) - 6\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n\\[\n= 45 - \\frac{28}{3} - 6\\left(\\frac{16}{9}\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 45 - \\frac{28}{3} - \\frac{96}{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 45 - \\frac{28}{3} - \\frac{32}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 45 - \\frac{28 + 32}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 45 - \\frac{60}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 45 - 20\n\\]\n\\[\n= 25 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe calculation checks out. When \\( t = \\frac{4}{3} \\) seconds, the height \\( h \\) is indeed 25 feet. This confirms that the solution is correct.\n\n### Step 5: Final Thoughts and Conclusion\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Factoring Worked:** Starting with factoring the quadratic equation was a good strategy. It led directly to the correct solution without needing to resort to the quadratic formula.\n\n- **Negative Time Disregarded:** The negative time solution was logically dismissed since time cannot be negative in this context.\n\n- **Verification Ensured Accuracy:** Plugging the solution back into the original equation verified the correctness of the solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe ball will reach a height of 25 feet at approximately\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ seconds} \\approx 1.33 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n**Ahh, Moment:**\n\nStarting with factoring seemed intuitive, and it paid off. However, being open to switching strategies is crucial, as seen when considering the quadratic formula as a backup. Always checking and verifying ensures accuracy, especially when initial solutions present unexpected outcomes, like the negative time here.\n\n---\n\n**Final Note:**\n\nEmulating human thought, including brainstorming, exploring multiple strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying solutions, leads to a more thorough and accurate problem-solving process. This approach not only ensures correctness but also deepens understanding by engaging with the problem at every stage.",
