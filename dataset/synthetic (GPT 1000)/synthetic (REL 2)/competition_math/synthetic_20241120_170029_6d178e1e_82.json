    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I\u2019ll begin by brainstorming different approaches, reflecting on each step, checking if I\u2019m on the right track, and adjusting my methods as needed. Let\u2019s mimic a natural human thought process, including initial confusion, realizations, and corrections along the way.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nThe problem states:\n\n**If 20% of 10% of a number is 12, what is 10% of 20% of the same number?**\n\nInitially, I think this involves percentages and multiplications, similar to problems I've encountered before. My first reaction is to deal with the percentages numerically. However, I feel a bit stuck because I'm not entirely sure how to relate these two different percentage calculations directly. It seems like a matter of order in operations, which reminds me of the properties of multiplication, but I need to explore more.\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Calculate the Number Step by Step:**\n   - This involves finding the original number (let\u2019s call it \\( x \\)) by reversing the given percentages.\n   \n2. **Use Algebraic Equations:**\n   - Set up an equation based on the given information to solve for \\( x \\).\n   \n3. **Proportional Reasoning:**\n   - Since percentages are parts of wholes, maybe there's a proportional relationship that can simplify the problem.\n\nHmm, calculating step by step seems straightforward, but using algebra might streamline things. Let\u2019s start with calculating step by step to build understanding, then consider using an equation for efficiency.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculating the Original Number (\\( x \\))**\n\n**First Attempt:**\n\nGiven:\n\\[ 20\\% \\text{ of } 10\\% \\text{ of } x = 12 \\]\n\nLet\u2019s write this out mathematically:\n\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 0.10 \\times x = 12 \\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nWait, so multiplying 20% and 10% together means I'm taking 2% of \\( x \\) directly. That seems logical because:\n\n\\[ 0.20 \\times 0.10 = 0.02 \\]\n\nSo, effectively, 2% of \\( x \\) is 12.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nIf 2% of \\( x \\) is 12, then to find \\( x \\), I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 0.02x = 12 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), divide both sides by 0.02:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{12}{0.02} \\]\n\nLet\u2019s do this division:\n\n\\[ x = 12 \\div 0.02 = 600 \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this make sense? If 2% of 600 is indeed 12:\n\n\\[ 0.02 \\times 600 = 12 \\]\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the original number \\( x \\) is 600.\n\n### **Step 2: Finding 10% of 20% of the Same Number**\n\n**Second Thought:**\n\nNow, I need to find 10% of 20% of 600. This looks similar to the initial condition but in reverse order. I\u2019m wondering if the percentages will cancel out in a similar way.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nLet\u2019s set it up:\n\n\\[ 10\\% \\text{ of } 20\\% \\text{ of } 600 \\]\n\nMathematically:\n\n\\[ 0.10 \\times 0.20 \\times 600 \\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n1. **Multiply the Percentages:**\n   \\[ 0.10 \\times 0.20 = 0.02 \\]\n   \n2. **Multiply by 600:**\n   \\[ 0.02 \\times 600 = 12 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute! This gives me 12, the same as in the initial condition. That seems surprising but makes sense because the order of multiplying percentages doesn't affect the final result. Multiplication is commutative, so:\n\n\\[ 20\\% \\times 10\\% \\times x = 10\\% \\times 20\\% \\times x \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this alignment feel correct? Yes, both calculations lead back to the same multiplicative effect (2% of \\( x \\)), which is consistent.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\n- **First Calculation:** Found \\( x = 600 \\) by resolving 2% of \\( x \\) to 12.\n- **Second Calculation:** Confirmed that 10% of 20% of 600 is also 12.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThis symmetry suggests that the problem is designed this way intentionally. It reinforces that the order of applying percentages doesn't matter as long as the operations are multiplicative.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, I can confidently say that 10% of 20% of the number is **12**. The key was recognizing that both scenarios represent the same mathematical operation: taking 2% of \\( x \\).\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Proportional Reasoning**\n\n**Considering a Different Strategy:**\n\nLet\u2019s think about it differently to ensure the solution is robust.\n\nGiven:\n\\[ 20\\% \\times 10\\% = 0.02 \\]\n  \nSo, essentially, taking 2% of \\( x \\) equals 12.\n\nNow, if we reverse the order:\n\\[ 10\\% \\times 20\\% = 0.02 \\]\n  \nAgain, taking 2% of \\( x \\) equals 12.\n\nThis alignment shows that regardless of the order in which the percentages are applied, the result remains consistent due to the commutative property of multiplication.\n\n**Verification:**\n\nTo solidify this understanding, let\u2019s briefly consider how different percentage orders work:\n\n- **20% then 10%:** First, take 20% of \\( x \\), which is 120 (since \\( 20\\% \\times 600 = 120 \\)). Then, take 10% of 120, which is 12.\n  \n- **10% then 20%:** First, take 10% of \\( x \\), which is 60 (since \\( 10\\% \\times 600 = 60 \\)). Then, take 20% of 60, which is 12.\n\n**Check:**\n\nBoth scenarios lead to the same final result, confirming the consistency of the approach.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Key Insight:** The order of applying multiple percentages multiplicatively doesn\u2019t affect the outcome. This property simplifies the problem significantly.\n  \n- **Confidence in Solution:** By exploring different strategies and verifying the result through multiple methods, I\u2019m confident that 10% of 20% of the number is indeed **12**.\n\n- **Lesson Learned:** Always consider the properties of operations (like commutativity) when dealing with percentages in sequence, as it can streamline the solution process.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter brainstorming, calculating step by step, reflecting, and verifying through alternative approaches, the answer is clear and consistent. **10% of 20% of the same number is 12.**",

Since a percent of a percent is simply multiplying two decimals, it does not matter what order we take the percentages - it will be the same result.  Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$."
