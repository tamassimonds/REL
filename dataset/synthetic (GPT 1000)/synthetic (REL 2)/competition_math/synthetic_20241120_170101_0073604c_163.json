    "working_out": "### Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem: **How many even natural-number factors does \\( n = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 7^2 \\) have?**\n\nWhen I first see this, a few things come to mind:\n\n1. **Understanding Factors**: I remember that factors are numbers that divide \\( n \\) without leaving a remainder. So, we're looking for all even numbers that can divide this specific \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization**: The given \\( n \\) is already factored into primes, which is helpful because I know that every factor of \\( n \\) must be a combination of these primes raised to their respective exponents.\n\n3. **Even Numbers**: To be even, a number must include at least one factor of 2. This seems crucial because it narrows down the possible factors to those that include 2 in their composition.\n\n4. **Total Number of Factors**: There's a general formula for finding the total number of factors based on prime factorization, but since we're only interested in even factors, I might need to tweak that approach.\n\nSo, I think I need to explore strategies that involve both counting factors and ensuring that 2 is included in each.\n\n### Exploring Strategies\n\n**Strategy 1: Counting All Factors and Excluding Odd Ones**\n\nMy first idea is to calculate the total number of factors of \\( n \\) and then subtract the number of odd factors. This way, the remaining factors would be even.\n\n- **Total Factors Calculation**: Remembering the formula, for \\( n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots \\cdot p_k^{e_k} \\), the total number of factors is \\( (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1) \\).\n\n  \\[\n  n = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 7^2 \\implies (2 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 18\n  \\]\n\n  So, there are **18 total factors**.\n\n- **Odd Factors Calculation**: Odd factors won't include the prime 2. Therefore, I only consider the factors involving \\( 3^1 \\cdot 7^2 \\).\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total odd factors} = (1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\n  \\]\n\n- **Even Factors**: Subtracting the number of odd factors from the total factors gives:\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Even factors} = 18 - 6 = 12\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection**: Wait a moment! This approach suggests there are 12 even factors. But let me double-check by perhaps counting the even factors directly to see if this aligns.\n\n### Strategy 2: Directly Counting Even Factors\n\nTo verify, I can attempt to count the even factors directly by considering how many combinations include at least one factor of 2.\n\n- **Including At Least One Factor of 2**: Since \\( n \\) has \\( 2^2 \\), I can have 1 or 2 factors of 2.\n\n  - **1 Factor of 2**: The remaining primes can be combined in any way.\n    \\[\n    \\text{Choices} = 1 \\times (1 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\n    \\]\n  - **2 Factors of 2**: Similarly, account for combinations where both factors of 2 are included.\n    \\[\n    \\text{Choices} = 1 \\times (1 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\n    \\]\n\n  Adding these together:\n  \\[\n  6 + 6 = 12\n  \\]\n\n**Check**: This matches the previous calculation, suggesting that there are indeed **12 even factors**.\n\n### Alternative Strategy: Factor Exponent Reduction\n\nAnother approach is to consider adjusting the exponents in the prime factorization to account for the presence of 2, ensuring that each even factor includes at least one 2.\n\n- **Adjusting Exponents**: Since we're dealing with even factors, at least one exponent of 2 must be greater than zero.\n\n  \\[\n  n_{\\text{even}} = 2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 7^2 \\quad (\\text{one factor of 2})\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  n_{\\text{even}} = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 7^2 \\quad (\\text{two factors of 2})\n  \\]\n\nIn terms of counting:\n\n- **One Factor of 2**: Same as above, 6 combinations.\n- **Two Factors of 2**: Same, 6 combinations.\n\nAdding these:\n\\[\n6 + 6 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: This method reiterates our previous findings, confirming that there are **12 even factors**.\n\n### Final Check\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure everything adds up:\n\n- **Total Factors**: 18\n- **Odd Factors**: 6\n- **Even Factors**: 12 (18 total - 6 odd)\n\nEverything seems consistent. The multiple strategies led to the same conclusion, which adds a layer of confidence that the answer is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014counting total factors and subtracting odd factors, directly counting even factors, and adjusting exponents to account for the necessity of at least one factor of 2\u2014all approaches consistently point to **12 even natural-number factors** for \\( n = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 7^2 \\). \n\n**Final Answer**: **12**\n\nIt's always good practice to verify through multiple methods, especially when dealing with factorization problems, to ensure accuracy.",
