    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like how I'd naturally approach it if I were solving it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step to check if I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nWhen I first see the equation \\(x^2 - 50y^2 - 10x + 25 = 0\\), I recognize it has both \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\) terms. This makes me think it could be one of the conic sections: a **parabola**, **ellipse**, **hyperbola**, or maybe even a **circle**. However, I remember that circles and ellipses only have positive coefficients for both \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\), while hyperbolas have both signs. Parabolas only involve one squared term. \n\nBut wait\u2014this equation has both \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\) with different signs, which leans towards being a **hyperbola**. \n\nStill, I'm not entirely sure yet. Let's explore different strategies to confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Identify the Conic Section by Standard Form:**\n   - Convert the given equation into a form that matches the standard equations of conic sections.\n\n2. **Complete the Square:**\n   - Try to rewrite the equation by completing the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to see if it aligns with a particular conic section.\n\n3. **Analyze the General Equation:**\n   - Use the general second-degree equation coefficients to determine the type of conic.\n\n4. **Graphing Approach:**\n   - If possible, sketch the graph to visually identify the conic section.\n\n**Reflection:** \n\nThe first two methods seem more systematic for identifying the conic. Graphing might help, but it's not always precise without tools. So, I'll start with identifying the conic by converting to the standard form and then try completing the square if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempt to Identify the Conic Section by Standard Form**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI know that conic sections can be classified based on the relationship between the squared terms and the constant. The general form is:\n\n\\[\nAx^2 + By^2 + Cx + Dy + E = 0\n\\]\n\n- **Ellipse:** \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are both positive or both negative, and \\(A \\neq B\\).\n- **Circle:** \\(A = B > 0\\)\n- **Hyperbola:** \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have different signs.\n- **Parabola:** Only one squared term is present.\n\nLooking at our equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 50y^2 - 10x + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\n- \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = -50\\), \\(C = -10\\), \\(D = 0\\), \\(E = 25\\)\n\nSince \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have different signs (\\(1\\) and \\(-50\\)), this suggests it might be a **hyperbola**.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nThis aligns with my initial thought. Having both \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\) with opposite signs typically indicates a hyperbola.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBut to be sure, let's proceed with another method\u2014completing the square\u2014to see if it confirms this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Complete the Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nCompleting the square helps rewrite the equation in a form that makes it easier to identify the conic. Let's apply this to both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms.\n\n**Here's how it works:**\n\n**For the \\(x\\) terms:**\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x\n\\]\n\nTo complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\), square it, and adjust the equation accordingly.\n\nHalf of \\(-10\\) is \\(-5\\), and squaring it gives \\(25\\).\n\nSo, \n\\[\nx^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25\n\\]\n\n**For the \\(y\\) terms:**\n\\[\n-50y^2\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\(-50\\) to make it easier to complete the square:\n\\[\n-50(y^2)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHere, you can't complete the square for \\(y^2\\) with a negative coefficient directly into a perfect square. This suggests that perhaps rearranging the equation differently might help.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nLet\u2019s attempt to rearrange the equation to see if a standard form emerges.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Reorganize the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's move all terms involving \\(x\\) to one side and \\(y\\) to the other to see if a clearer pattern emerges:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x - 50y^2 + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, let's group the \\(x\\) terms and the constants separately:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 10x) - 50y^2 + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis still doesn't make it straightforward. Maybe completing the square for \\(x\\) first will help. Let's proceed with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Complete the Square for \\(x\\) and Rearrange**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nFrom Step 2, we have:\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back into the equation:\n\\[\n((x - 5)^2 - 25) - 50y^2 + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 - 50y^2 - 25 + 25 = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 - 50y^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nNow the equation looks cleaner. Let's see if this matches the standard form of a hyperbola. \n\nThe standard form of a hyperbola is:\n\\[\n\\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1\n\\]\nor\n\\[\n\\frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} - \\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nBut our equation is set to \\(= 0\\), not \\(= 1\\). So, possibly it's a degenerate hyperbola or another type of conic altogether.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, this is interesting. The equation simplifies to \\((x - 5)^2 - 50y^2 = 0\\), which resembles the standard form of a hyperbola squared set to zero. This might indicate that it's not an ordinary hyperbola but rather two lines intersecting at a point.\n\nThis suggests that the conic is **degenerate**, meaning it does not form a standard hyperbola but rather a pair of intersecting lines.\n\n**Alternative Insight:**\n\nAnother way to view this is by recognizing that the equation represents the difference of squares:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 - b^2 = 0) \\implies (a - b)(a + b) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \n\\[\n(x - 5)^2 = 50y^2\n\\]\n\nThis can be factored into two linear equations:\n\\[\n(x - 5 - \\sqrt{50}y)(x - 5 + \\sqrt{50}y) = 0\n\\]\n\nWhich represents two lines:\n\\[\nx - 5 - \\sqrt{50}y = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x - 5 + \\sqrt{50}y = 0\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\nSo, the original equation does not represent a hyperbola in the traditional sense but rather a degenerate hyperbola that consists of two lines. \n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Conclude and Verify**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe graph of the equation \\(x^2 - 50y^2 - 10x + 25 = 0\\) represents **two intersecting lines**. Specifically, it can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n(x - 5 - \\sqrt{50}y)(x - 5 + \\sqrt{50}y) = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the solutions are the lines:\n\\[\nx - 5 - \\sqrt{50}y = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x - 5 + \\sqrt{50}y = 0\n\\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\nLet\u2019s quickly check if this makes sense:\n\n1. **Correct Factorization:**\n   - \\((x - 5)^2 - 50y^2 = 0\\) factors into \\((x - 5 - \\sqrt{50}y)(x - 5 + \\sqrt{50}y) = 0\\).\n\n2. **Degenerate Hyperbola:**\n   - The original equation represents a degenerate hyperbola that consists of two intersecting lines, not a standard hyperbola.\n\n3. **Answer Consistency:**\n   - This aligns with the properties of conic sections, confirming that the graph is indeed two lines.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nAt first glance, I suspected it was a hyperbola due to the presence of both \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\) terms with different signs. However, by completing the square and recognizing the equation as a difference of squares, I realized it represents two intersecting lines. Reflecting throughout the process helped catch potential misinterpretations and led to the correct identification of the conic.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe original equation \\(x^2 - 50y^2 - 10x + 25 = 0\\) represents two intersecting lines. By completing the square and factoring, we identified it as a degenerate hyperbola consisting of the lines \\(x - 5 - \\sqrt{50}y = 0\\) and \\(x - 5 + \\sqrt{50}y = 0\\). Throughout the problem, reflecting and checking each step ensured the correctness of the final conclusion.",
