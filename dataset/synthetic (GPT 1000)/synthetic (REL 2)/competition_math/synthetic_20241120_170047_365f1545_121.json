    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem by mimicking how a human would naturally approach it. I'll start with brainstorming and exploring different strategies, reflect often to ensure correctness, check my work regularly, and be open to changing directions if something doesn't seem right. Let's take it step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Understanding the Question**: We have a \\(3 - 4 - 5\\) right triangle with vertices as centers of three mutually externally tangent circles. The goal is to find the sum of the areas of these circles.\n  \n- **Initial Reaction**: This reminds me of problems involving circles and triangles, possibly using the Pythagorean theorem or properties of tangent circles. But I'm not entirely sure how to connect the triangle's sides directly to the circles' radii.\n\n- **Possible Strategies**:\n  1. **Use Proportions Based on Triangle Sides**: Maybe the radii are proportional to the sides of the triangle.\n  2. **Apply Pythagorean Theorem**: Although I don't see an immediate application here.\n  3. **Explore Symmetry or Geometric Relationships**: Since the circles are tangent, there might be a relationship between their positions and the triangle's sides.\n  \n- **Reflection**: Proportionality seems like a good starting point because the circles are centered at the triangle's vertices. But I might need more information to connect the triangle's sides to the circles' radii.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Approaches**\n\n1. **Proportionality Method**:\n   - Assume the radii of the circles are proportional to the lengths of the triangle's sides opposite their respective vertices.\n\n2. **Geometric Mean Approach**:\n   - Consider the areas of the circles and see if there's a relationship similar to geometric means involving triangle sides.\n\n3. **Coordinate Geometry**:\n   - Place the triangle in a coordinate system to calculate positions and distances directly.\n\n4. **Visual Inspection and Intuition**:\n   - Use the given diagram to make educated guesses about the relationships.\n\n**Wait a moment...**  \nBefore diving deeper, I recall that in mutually externally tangent circles, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii. This might be a crucial observation.\n\n**Reevaluation**:  \nPerhaps, combining the proportionality of sides with the property of tangent circles could lead to the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Mutually Externally Tangent Property**\n\n**Thought Process**:  \nIn mutually externally tangent circles, the distance between the centers equals the sum of their radii. Therefore, for circles centered at the triangle's vertices:\n\n\\[\nAB = r_A + r_B \\\\\nBC = r_B + r_C \\\\\nCA = r_C + r_A\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(AB\\), \\(BC\\), and \\(CA\\) are the sides of the triangle opposite vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), respectively, and \\(r_A\\), \\(r_B\\), and \\(r_C\\) are the radii of the circles at vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\).\n\n**Formula Setup**:\n\n\\[\nr_A + r_B = \\text{length of side } BC \\\\\nr_B + r_C = \\text{length of side } CA \\\\\nr_C + r_A = \\text{length of side } AB\n\\]\n\n**Wait, that can't be right because...**  \nI realize I can't directly assign the side lengths to these equations without knowing which sides correspond to which vertices. I need a clearer mapping between triangle sides and circle radii.\n\n**Reflection**:  \nMaybe I need to relate the side lengths to the radii through another property, such as the area of the triangle or the semiperimeter.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Connecting Triangle Sides and Circle Radii**\n\n**New Approach**:  \nLet's consider the triangle's perimeter and how the circle radii relate to it.\n\n**Thought Process**:  \nThe sum of the radii of two circles equals the length of the side opposite the vertex where the third circle is located. This suggests a relationship involving the triangle's perimeter.\n\n**Defining Variables**:  \nLet \\(r_A\\), \\(r_B\\), and \\(r_C\\) be the radii of the circles at vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), respectively.\n\n**Setting Up Equations**:\n\n\\[\nr_A + r_B = \\text{length of side } CA = 4 \\\\\nr_B + r_C = \\text{length of side } AB = 5 \\\\\nr_C + r_A = \\text{length of side } BC = 3\n\\]\n\n**Wait a moment...**  \nThis seems more concrete. Now I can solve these equations to find the radii.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving the System of Equations**\n\n**Thought Process**:  \nI have a system of three linear equations with three unknowns. A common method is substitution or elimination.\n\n**Equations**:\n\n1. \\(r_A + r_B = 4\\)\n2. \\(r_B + r_C = 5\\)\n3. \\(r_C + r_A = 3\\)\n\n**Solving for \\(r_A\\), \\(r_B\\), and \\(r_C\\)**:\n\n- **From Equation 1**:  \n  \\(r_A = 4 - r_B\\)\n\n- **Substitute \\(r_A\\) into Equation 3**:  \n  \\(r_C + (4 - r_B) = 3\\)  \n  Simplify:  \n  \\(r_C = 3 - 4 + r_B = r_B - 1\\)\n\n- **Substitute \\(r_C\\) into Equation 2**:  \n  \\(r_B + (r_B - 1) = 5\\)  \n  \\(2r_B - 1 = 5\\)  \n  \\(2r_B = 6\\)  \n  \\(r_B = 3\\)\n\n- **Find \\(r_C\\)**:  \n  \\(r_C = r_B - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\\)\n\n- **Find \\(r_A\\)**:  \n  \\(r_A = 4 - r_B = 4 - 3 = 1\\)\n\n**Check the Work**:  \nLet\u2019s verify these values against the original equations:\n\n1. \\(r_A + r_B = 1 + 3 = 4\\) \u2705\n2. \\(r_B + r_C = 3 + 2 = 5\\) \u2705\n3. \\(r_C + r_A = 2 + 1 = 3\\) \u2705\n\n**Reflection**:  \nThe radii \\(r_A = 1\\), \\(r_B = 3\\), and \\(r_C = 2\\) satisfy all three equations. This seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Areas of the Circles**\n\n**Thought Process**:  \nNow that I have the radii, I can calculate the area of each circle using the formula \\( \\text{Area} = \\pi r^2 \\).\n\n**Calculations**:\n\n- **Circle at Vertex \\(A\\)**:  \n  \\(\\text{Area}_A = \\pi (1)^2 = \\pi\\)\n\n- **Circle at Vertex \\(B\\)**:  \n  \\(\\text{Area}_B = \\pi (3)^2 = 9\\pi\\)\n\n- **Circle at Vertex \\(C\\)**:  \n  \\(\\text{Area}_C = \\pi (2)^2 = 4\\pi\\)\n\n**Wait, is this correct?**  \nLet me quickly check if these areas make sense:\n\n- The areas are proportional to the squares of the radii, which is expected since area depends on radius squared.\n\n- Also, the sum of areas involves \\(\\pi\\), matching the problem's requirement.\n\n**Reflection**:  \nEverything checks out. The areas seem reasonable given the radii.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the Sum of the Areas**\n\n**Thought Process**:  \nSimply add the areas of all three circles together.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Area} = \\pi + 9\\pi + 4\\pi = 14\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Final Check**:  \n- The calculation is straightforward: \\(\\pi (1 + 9 + 4) = 14\\pi\\).\n- The sum makes sense given the individual circle areas.\n\n**Reflection**:  \nThe sum of the areas is \\(14\\pi\\), and all steps align logically. The approach was correct, and the calculations are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy applying the property of mutually externally tangent circles and setting up a system of equations based on the triangle's side lengths, I determined the radii of the circles. Calculating the areas of each circle and summing them led to the final answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{14\\pi}\n\\]\n\nThroughout the process, I brainstormed different strategies, reflected on each step's validity, checked my work regularly, and adjusted my approach as needed to ensure accuracy.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $r$, $s$, and $t$ be the radii of the circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively. Then $r+s=3$, $r+t=4$, and $s+t=5$.  Adding these three equations gives $2(r+s+t) = 12$, so $r+s+t = 6$.  Combining this with the original three equations, we get $r=1$, $s=2$, and $t=3$. Thus the sum of the areas of the circles is \\[\n\\pi(1^2+2^2+3^2)=\\boxed{14\\pi}.\n\\]"
