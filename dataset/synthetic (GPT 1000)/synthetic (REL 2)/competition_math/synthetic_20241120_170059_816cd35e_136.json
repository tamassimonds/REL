I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on my approaches, and make sure to check my work often to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's start by understanding the question thoroughly.\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**User Query:**  \nThere are two positive integers \\( c \\) for which the equation  \n\\[ 5x^2 + 11x + c = 0 \\]  \nhas rational solutions. What is the product of those two values of \\( c \\)?\n\n**First Thoughts:**  \n- The problem involves finding positive integers \\( c \\) such that the quadratic equation has rational solutions.\n- I recall that for a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the solutions are rational if the discriminant is a perfect square.\n- This reminds me of problems where the discriminant condition is key to determining the nature of the roots.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Discriminant Approach:**  \n   - Use the discriminant to find conditions under which the roots are rational.\n   \n2. **Factoring Method:**  \n   - Try to factor the quadratic equation to find possible values of \\( c \\).\n   \n3. **Completing the Square:**  \n   - Complete the square to express the equation in a different form.\n\n4. **Test Specific Examples:**  \n   - Plug in different values of \\( c \\) to see which ones work.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**  \n- The **Discriminant Approach** seems the most straightforward because it directly relates to the condition for rational roots.\n- **Factoring Method** could be helpful if I can spot a pattern.\n- **Completing the Square** might not be the best here since the equation is already in standard form.\n- **Testing Specific Examples** could confirm my findings but may not be the most efficient.\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Discriminant Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- For a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant \\( \\Delta \\) is given by  \n  \\[ \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\]  \n- The roots are rational if \\( \\Delta \\) is a perfect square.\n- Given \\( a = 5 \\) and \\( b = 11 \\), let's set up the equation for \\( \\Delta \\).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- Plug in the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):  \n  \\[ \\Delta = 11^2 - 4 \\times 5 \\times c \\]  \n  \\[ \\Delta = 121 - 20c \\]  \n- For the roots to be rational, \\( 121 - 20c \\) must be a perfect square.\n\n**Check:**  \n- Is \\( 121 - 20c \\) a perfect square for some positive integers \\( c \\)?  \n- I need to find such \\( c \\) where this expression is a perfect square.\n\n### **Step 2: Finding Possible Values of \\( c \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Let's set \\( 121 - 20c = k^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer.  \n- Rearranging gives:  \n  \\[ 20c = 121 - k^2 \\]  \n  \\[ c = \\frac{121 - k^2}{20} \\]  \n- Since \\( c \\) must be a positive integer, \\( 121 - k^2 \\) must be positive and divisible by 20.\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- \\( 121 - k^2 > 0 \\) implies \\( k^2 < 121 \\), so \\( |k| < 11 \\).  \n- Therefore, \\( k \\) can take values from -10 to 10, excluding \u00b111.\n\n**Checking for Divisibility by 20:**  \n- I need to check which of these values make \\( \\frac{121 - k^2}{20} \\) an integer.\n\n**Iterating through \\( k \\) values:**  \n- **For \\( k = -10 \\):**  \n  \\[ c = \\frac{121 - (-10)^2}{20} = \\frac{121 - 100}{20} = \\frac{21}{20} \\]  \n  - **Not an integer.**\n\n- **For \\( k = -9 \\):**  \n  \\[ c = \\frac{121 - (-9)^2}{20} = \\frac{121 - 81}{20} = \\frac{40}{20} = 2 \\]  \n  - **Valid integer.**\n\n- **Continue checking up to \\( k = 10 \\):**\n\n  - \\( k = -8 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 64}{20} = \\frac{57}{20} \\) \u2014 Not an integer.\n  - \\( k = -7 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 49}{20} = \\frac{72}{20} = 3.6 \\) \u2014 Not an integer.\n  - \\( k = -6 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 36}{20} = \\frac{85}{20} = 4.25 \\) \u2014 Not an integer.\n  - \\( k = -5 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 25}{20} = \\frac{96}{20} = 4.8 \\) \u2014 Not an integer.\n  - \\( k = -4 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 16}{20} = \\frac{105}{20} = 5.25 \\) \u2014 Not an integer.\n  - \\( k = -3 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 9}{20} = \\frac{112}{20} = 5.6 \\) \u2014 Not an integer.\n  - \\( k = -2 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 4}{20} = \\frac{117}{20} = 5.85 \\) \u2014 Not an integer.\n  - \\( k = -1 \\):  \n    \\[ c = \\frac{121 - 1}{20} = \\frac{120}{20} = 6 \\]  \n    - **Valid integer.**\n  \n  - \\( k = 0 \\):  \n    \\[ c = \\frac{121 - 0}{20} = \\frac{121}{20} = 6.05 \\]  \n    - **Not an integer.**\n  \n  - \\( k = 1 \\):  \n    \\[ c = \\frac{121 - 1}{20} = \\frac{120}{20} = 6 \\]  \n    - **Already found.**\n\n  - **Continue with positive \\( k \\):**  \n    - \\( k = 2 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 4}{20} = \\frac{117}{20} = 5.85 \\) \u2014 Not an integer.\n    - \\( k = 3 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 9}{20} = \\frac{112}{20} = 5.6 \\) \u2014 Not an integer.\n    - \\( k = 4 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 16}{20} = \\frac{105}{20} = 5.25 \\) \u2014 Not an integer.\n    - \\( k = 5 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 25}{20} = \\frac{96}{20} = 4.8 \\) \u2014 Not an integer.\n    - \\( k = 6 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 36}{20} = \\frac{85}{20} = 4.25 \\) \u2014 Not an integer.\n    - \\( k = 7 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 49}{20} = \\frac{72}{20} = 3.6 \\) \u2014 Not an integer.\n    - \\( k = 8 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 64}{20} = \\frac{57}{20} = 2.85 \\) \u2014 Not an integer.\n    - \\( k = 9 \\): \\( \\frac{121 - 81}{20} = \\frac{40}{20} = 2 \\) \u2014 **Valid integer.**\n    - \\( k = 10 \\):  \n      \\[ c = \\frac{121 - 100}{20} = \\frac{21}{20} = 1.05 \\]  \n      - **Not an integer.**\n\n**Summary of Valid \\( c \\) Values:**  \n- From the above calculations, the valid positive integers \\( c \\) are **2** and **6**.\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Discriminant Condition**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- I should verify that for \\( c = 2 \\) and \\( c = 6 \\), the discriminant \\( \\Delta \\) is indeed a perfect square.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **For \\( c = 2 \\):**  \n  \\[ \\Delta = 121 - 20 \\times 2 = 121 - 40 = 81 \\]  \n  \\[ \\sqrt{81} = 9 \\] (which is an integer)  \n  - **Perfect square.**\n\n- **For \\( c = 6 \\):**  \n  \\[ \\Delta = 121 - 20 \\times 6 = 121 - 120 = 1 \\]  \n  \\[ \\sqrt{1} = 1 \\] (which is an integer)  \n  - **Perfect square.**\n\n**Check:**  \n- Both \\( c = 2 \\) and \\( c = 6 \\) yield discriminants that are perfect squares, confirming that the quadratic equations have rational solutions.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Product of \\( c \\) Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- The question asks for the product of the two values of \\( c \\).  \n- Since we've identified \\( c = 2 \\) and \\( c = 6 \\) as the two positive integers, their product should be straightforward to calculate.\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[ \\text{Product} = 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\]\n\n**Check:**  \n- Multiplying 2 and 6 indeed gives 12.  \n- This aligns with the requirement that both \\( c \\) values are positive integers.\n\n### **Reflection and Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:**  \n  - I started by considering various strategies, settling on the Discriminant Approach as the most direct method.\n  \n- **Implementation:**  \n  - By setting up the equation \\( 121 - 20c = k^2 \\), I systematically tested integer values of \\( k \\) to find valid \\( c \\) values.\n  \n- **Verification:**  \n  - Checking the discriminant for the identified \\( c \\) values confirmed that they lead to rational solutions.\n  \n- **Product Calculation:**  \n  - The product of the two valid \\( c \\) values was calculated easily once they were identified.\n\n- **Final Check:**  \n  - Throughout the process, I periodically checked whether each step made sense and aligned with the problem's requirements. Everything checks out, and the final answer is consistent.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \n- By approaching the problem step by step and checking each part of the process, I ensured that the solution is robust.\n- Exploring different strategies and reflecting on their effectiveness helped in finding the correct path.\n- It's important to verify each step, especially when dealing with conditions like perfect squares in discriminants, to avoid mistakes.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps in understanding how to tackle such problems methodically, reflecting and adapting strategies as needed to arrive at the correct solution.",

  "ground_truth": "By the quadratic formula, the equation $5x^2+11x+c=0$ has solutions $$x = \\frac{-(11)\\pm\\sqrt{(11)^2-4(5)(c)}}{2(5)} = \\frac{-11\\pm\\sqrt{121-20c}}{10}.$$For these solutions to be rational, the quantity under the square root (i.e., the discriminant) must be a perfect square. So, we seek the possible (positive integer) values of $c$ for which $121-20c$ is a square. The possible nonnegative values for $121-20c$ are $101$, $81$, $61$, $41$, $21$, or $1$. The only squares in this list are $81$, coming from $c=2$, and $1$, coming from $c=6$. So the product of the two possible $c$ values is $2\\cdot 6=\\boxed{12}$."
