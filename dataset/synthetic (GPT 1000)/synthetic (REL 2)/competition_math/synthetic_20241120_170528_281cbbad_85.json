    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, and make adjustments as needed\u2014just like how I'd approach it naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n- **Container A**: 4 red balls and 6 green balls.\n- **Containers B and C**: Each have 6 red balls and 4 green balls.\n\nWe need to:\n\n1. **Select a container at random.**\n2. **Then, select a ball from that container.**\n3. **Determine the probability that the selected ball is green.**\n\nAt first glance, this reminds me of probability problems involving conditional events. Maybe something like the **Law of Total Probability** could work here? But then again, I\u2019m not entirely sure if that\u2019s applicable. Another method could be to use **weighted probabilities** since each container has a different composition of red and green balls.\n\nHmm, let me explore these ideas further.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Law of Total Probability:**\n   - This approach considers all possible ways to select a green ball, taking into account the probability of selecting each container and the probability of drawing a green ball from that container.\n\n2. **Weighted Probability:**\n   - Here, I\u2019d calculate the probability of picking a green ball by weighting the probabilities based on the composition of each container and their selection probabilities.\n\n3. **Simple Enumeration:**\n   - List out all possible outcomes (though with three containers and two ball colors, this might get a bit cumbersome).\n\nWait, the Law of Total Probability seems promising because it systematically accounts for each container's contribution to the overall probability of selecting a green ball. Let\u2019s try that first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Law of Total Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I need to consider each container separately and calculate the probability of picking a green ball from each one.\n- Then, I\u2019ll combine these probabilities, weighted by the likelihood of each container being selected.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Probability of selecting each container:**\n   - There are three containers (A, B, and C), so each is selected with a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Probability of selecting a green ball from each container:**\n   - **Container A:** \n     - Total balls = 4 red + 6 green = 10 balls\n     - Probability of green = \\(\\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}\\)\n\n   - **Container B:**\n     - Total balls = 6 red + 4 green = 10 balls\n     - Probability of green = \\(\\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}\\)\n\n   - **Container C:** Same as B.\n     - Probability of green = \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\)\n\n3. **Combining the probabilities:**\n\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Green}) = P(\\text{A}) \\times P(\\text{Green | A}) + P(\\text{B}) \\times P(\\text{Green | B}) + P(\\text{C}) \\times P(\\text{Green | C})\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{5}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\left( \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{7}{5}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{7}{15}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, that seems like a reasonable answer, but let me double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\n- **Container A:** \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{1}{5}\\)\n- **Container B:** \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2}{15}\\)\n- **Container C:** \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2}{15}\\)\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{3}{15} + \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{7}{15}\n\\]\n\nOkay, the math checks out. The probability is indeed \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying with Weighted Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Let\u2019s approach it differently to ensure our initial method is correct.\n- I\u2019ll calculate the probability of selecting a green ball by considering the total number of green balls across all containers and dividing it by the total number of balls.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Total number of balls:**\n\n   - Container A: 10 balls\n   - Container B: 10 balls\n   - Container C: 10 balls\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total} = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 balls\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total number of green balls:**\n\n   - Container A: 6 green balls\n   - Container B: 4 green balls\n   - Container C: 4 green balls\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total green} = 6 + 4 + 4 = 14 green balls\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the probability:**\n\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Green}) = \\frac{\\text{Total green}}{\\text{Total balls}} = \\frac{14}{30} = \\frac{7}{15}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute! This approach gives the same probability\u2014\\(\\frac{7}{15}\\)\u2014as the Law of Total Probability method. That\u2019s a good sign; it confirms our initial strategy was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Double-Checking the Work**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- It's always good to verify the final answer using multiple methods to ensure accuracy.\n- Both strategies led to the same probability, which adds confidence in the correctness.\n\n**Quick Checks:**\n\n- **Simplifying Fractions:** Both \\(\\frac{14}{30}\\) and \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\) are equivalent. No mistakes here.\n- **Consistency:** Both methods consistently arrived at the same probability. No discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\nAt first, I considered using the Law of Total Probability and weighted probability methods. Both approaches led me to the same probability of \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\), confirming the answer's correctness. Reflecting along the way helped catch and reassure that the calculations were accurate.\n\nIn conclusion, the probability of selecting a green ball is \\(\\frac{7}{15}\\).",

  "ground_truth": "There are three different possibilities for our first decision, each corresponding to which container we choose. So, if we choose container A, with $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability, we have a $\\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}$ probability of drawing green, which means we have  a $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{1}{5}$ of picking Container A and then picking a green ball. Similarly for container B the probability is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{15}$, and the same for container C. So, the total probability is $\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{2}{15} =\\boxed{ \\frac{7}{15}}$."
