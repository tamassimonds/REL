    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm my thoughts, explore different strategies, and reflect often to ensure each step makes sense. If something doesn't click, I'll backtrack and try a different approach. The goal is to mimic natural human thinking, complete with initial confusion, realizations, and checks along the way.\n\n## **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nWhen I see the expression \\(3x^y + 4y^x\\) and the values \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\), my initial reaction is to break it down into manageable parts. It looks like evaluating powers and then combining them with coefficients. This reminds me of problems where substitution plays a crucial role.\n\nBut let's be sure\u2014my first instinct is to substitute \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directly into the expression. However, I should verify whether there's a specific order of operations or properties of exponents that I might leverage here.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Direct Substitution:** Plugging in \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\) directly into the expression.\n2. **Breaking Down Exponents:** Evaluating \\(x^y\\) and \\(y^x\\) separately before multiplication.\n3. **Checking Commutativity:** Considering if the order of terms affects the outcome, even though addition is commutative.\n4. **Alternative Approaches:** Exploring if factoring or using properties of exponents could simplify calculations.\n\nInitially, the **Direct Substitution** seems like the most straightforward path, but I'll keep the other strategies in mind in case something feels off.\n\n## **Step 1: Evaluating the Expression with Direct Substitution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nOkay, let's try substituting \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\) directly into \\(3x^y + 4y^x\\).\n\n- **Compute \\(x^y\\):**  \n  \\[\n  x^y = 2^3 = 8\n  \\]\n  \n- **Compute \\(y^x\\):**  \n  \\[\n  y^x = 3^2 = 9\n  \\]\n  \n- **Substitute into the Expression:**  \n  \\[\n  3(8) + 4(9)\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n3 \\times 8 = 24\n\\]\n\\[\n4 \\times 9 = 36\n\\]\n\\[\n24 + 36 = 60\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check each exponent calculation:\n\n- \\(2^3 = 8\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBoth exponent calculations are correct. So, the addition part is:\n\\[\n24 + 36 = 60\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nIt seems the direct substitution worked well here. But to be thorough, let's explore another method to ensure the result is consistent.\n\n## **Step 2: Exploring an Alternative Method\u2014Breaking Down Exponents**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nMaybe there's a way to verify the result by breaking down the exponents and checking each part individually.\n\n- **Express \\(3x^y\\) and \\(4y^x\\) Separately:**\n  \n  \\[\n  3x^y = 3 \\times 2^3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  4y^x = 4 \\times 3^2\n  \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\nLet's compute \\(3 \\times 2^3\\) step-by-step:\n\\[\n2^3 = 8\n\\]\n\\[\n3 \\times 8 = 24\n\\]\n  \nNow, compute \\(4 \\times 3^2\\):\n\\[\n3^2 = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n4 \\times 9 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Combine Both Parts:**\n\\[\n24 + 36 = 60\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\nThis method aligns with the direct substitution result. Both parts add up to 60.\n\n**Reflection:**\nBoth approaches confirm the same result. It seems consistent, but let me ponder\u2014could there be an underlying property simplifying this further? Maybe the expression always evaluates neatly for integer exponents.\n\n## **Step 3: Considering Properties of Exponents**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nThinking about it, the expression involves both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) raised to each other's powers, multiplied by coefficients 3 and 4. Does this remind me of any properties or identities in mathematics?\n\n**Possible Insight:**\nPerhaps leveraging the **commutativity** of addition could allow rearranging terms, but since it's addition, it's already flexible. However, factoring doesn't seem applicable here due to the addition rather than multiplication.\n\n**Reflection:**\nI can't think of a property that further simplifies the expression beyond what's already done. Hence, sticking with the methods used seems best.\n\n## **Step 4: Final Check of the Calculation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore concluding, let's ensure every step was executed correctly. It's easy to miss a detail, especially with exponents.\n\n**Reviewing Steps:**\n- **Exponent Calculations:**  \n  \\(2^3 = 8\\) and \\(3^2 = 9\\) are correct.\n  \n- **Multiplications:**  \n  \\(3 \\times 8 = 24\\) and \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\) are accurate.\n  \n- **Addition:**  \n  \\(24 + 36 = 60\\) checks out.\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything aligns perfectly. No errors spotted, and multiple methods corroborate the result.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014**direct substitution** and **breaking down exponents**\u2014and verifying each step, the evaluation of the expression \\(3x^y + 4y^x\\) with \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\) is indeed **60**.\n\nI approached the problem by initially substituting values, then verifying through an alternative method, and finally ensuring correctness by reflecting and checking each calculation step. This methodical approach helped confirm the accuracy of the result.",
