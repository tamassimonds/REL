    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem together. I'll walk through my thought process as if I'm tackling it for the first time, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, checking my work, and making adjustments as needed. Let's aim to approach it like a human would, with all the explorations, doubts, and \"aha\" moments that come along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n\\[\n2010a + 2014b = 2018 \\quad (1)\n\\]\n\\[\n2012a + 2016b = 2020 \\quad (2)\n\\]\n\nHonestly, my initial reaction is, \"This looks like a system of linear equations.\" Solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) simultaneously feels familiar, but I'm contemplating whether there's a more straightforward method to find \\(a - b\\) directly.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  1. **Elimination Method:** Subtract one equation from the other to eliminate one variable.\n  2. **Substitution Method:** Express one variable in terms of the other and substitute back.\n  3. **Matrix Representation:** Use matrices to solve the system.\n  4. **Scaling Equations:** Multiply or divide equations to align coefficients for easier elimination.\n\nInitially, I think about using the **Elimination Method** because it seems direct and might immediately reveal the relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But I'm also considering whether scaling the equations could simplify things first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Elimination Method**\n\nLet\u2019s try the **Elimination Method** to see if it leads us directly to \\(a - b\\).\n\n- **Subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):**\n\n\\[\n(2012a + 2016b) - (2010a + 2014b) = 2020 - 2018\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n(2012a - 2010a) + (2016b - 2014b) = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n2a + 2b = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute, this simplifies nicely! I notice that both sides can be divided by 2.\n\n\\[\na + b = 1 \\quad (3)\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Does this make sense? Yes, because dividing both sides by 2 maintains the equality.\n\n- **Thoughts:** This simplification feels promising. From here, I can express \\(b\\) in terms of \\(a\\) or vice versa.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing Variables in Terms of Each Other**\n\nLet\u2019s use Equation (3) to express \\(b\\) in terms of \\(a\\):\n\n\\[\nb = 1 - a\n\\]\n\n- **Idea:** Substituting \\(b = 1 - a\\) into one of the original equations might help us find \\(a\\).\n\n**Reflecting:** This seems like a good next step. But before proceeding, let's check if substituting into both equations yields consistent results.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Substituting \\(b = 1 - a\\) into the Original Equations**\n\nLet's substitute \\(b = 1 - a\\) into Equation (1):\n\n\\[\n2010a + 2014(1 - a) = 2018\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n2010a + 2014 - 2014a = 2018\n\\]\n\\[\n(2010a - 2014a) + 2014 = 2018\n\\]\n\\[\n-4a + 2014 = 2018\n\\]\n\n**Isolating \\(a\\):**\n\n\\[\n-4a = 2018 - 2014\n\\]\n\\[\n-4a = 4\n\\]\n\\[\na = -1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, \\(a = -1\\). That seems to work out. But let\u2019s double-check by substituting \\(a = -1\\) back into Equation (3) to find \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\nb = 1 - (-1) = 2\n\\]\n\n**Check:** So, \\(a = -1\\) and \\(b = 2\\). This solution looks consistent. But let's verify by substituting \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) back into both original equations to ensure everything holds true.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Substituting into Equation (1):**\n\n\\[\n2010(-1) + 2014(2) = 2018\n\\]\n\\[\n-2010 + 4028 = 2018\n\\]\n\\[\n2018 = 2018 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n\\]\n\n**Substituting into Equation (2):**\n\n\\[\n2012(-1) + 2016(2) = 2020\n\\]\n\\[\n-2012 + 4032 = 2020\n\\]\n\\[\n2020 = 2020 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth equations are satisfied with \\(a = -1\\) and \\(b = 2\\). The solution checks out.\n\n- **Thoughts:** So far, so good. But the problem specifically asks for \\(a - b\\). Let\u2019s calculate that:\n\n\\[\na - b = -1 - 2 = -3\n\\]\n\n- **Final Check:** Does it make sense that \\(a - b = -3\\)? Yes, because \\(a\\) is negative and \\(b\\) is positive, so their difference being negative aligns with our values.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Scaling the Equations**\n\nEven though the Elimination Method worked well, let's briefly explore scaling the equations to see if it provides a different path:\n\n- **Idea:** Multiply both equations by a factor to make coefficients easier to work with.\n\n**Scaling Equation (1):**\n\n\\[\n2 \\times (2010a + 2014b = 2018) \\implies 4020a + 4028b = 4036 \\quad (4)\n\\]\n\n**Scaling Equation (2):**\n\n\\[\n2 \\times (2012a + 2016b = 2020) \\implies 4024a + 4032b = 4040 \\quad (5)\n\\]\n\n**Subtract Equation (4) from Equation (5):**\n\n\\[\n(4024a + 4032b) - (4020a + 4028b) = 4040 - 4036\n\\]\n\\[\n4a + 4b = 4\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\na + b = 1 \\quad (consistent with Equation (3))\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThis scaling led us back to the same simplified equation \\(a + b = 1\\). From there, we proceeded with the Elimination Method, which was effective. Scaling didn't necessarily provide a shortcut but confirmed the consistency of our solution path.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection: Confirming the Approach**\n\nLet me take a moment to reflect:\n\n- **Approach Validity:** The Elimination Method led us directly to a simplified equation, allowing us to solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) efficiently.\n- **Solution Consistency:** Verifying the solution in both original equations ensured that \\(a = -1\\) and \\(b = 2\\) are correct.\n- **Alternative Methods:** Exploring scaling reinforced the correctness of the solution but didn't offer a more straightforward path than elimination.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n\\[\na - b = -3\n\\]\n\n- **Final Check:** The negative difference makes sense given the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Everything aligns logically and mathematically.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step and reflecting at each stage, we ensured that our solution was thorough and accurate. Exploring different strategies, verifying each step, and being open to adjusting the approach allowed us to confidently arrive at the correct answer: \\(a - b = -3\\).\n\nThis methodical thinking\u2014brainstorming, attempting different strategies, checking work, and making real-time adjustments\u2014mimics natural human problem-solving, ensuring a deep understanding and validation of the solution process.",
