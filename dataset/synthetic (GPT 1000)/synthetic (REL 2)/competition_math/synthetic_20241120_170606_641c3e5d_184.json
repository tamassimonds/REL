I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\nOkay, the problem is to simplify \\((\\sqrt{5})^4\\). \n\nWhen I first see this, I recall that exponents and square roots are closely related. It reminds me of properties of exponents and radicals that I've encountered before. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure which approach is the most straightforward right now. Let me brainstorm a bit:\n\n- **Option 1:** I could use the property of exponents that states \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n}\\). Maybe that would help simplify the expression.\n  \n- **Option 2:** Another thought is to express \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) as \\(5^{1/2}\\) and then apply exponent rules. This seems like it could work, but I'm not entirely certain.\n\n- **Option 3:** Alternatively, I could evaluate \\((\\sqrt{5})^2\\) first and then square that result again. This feels more hands-on and might be easier to visualize.\n\nHmm, let me consider these options. The first two seem more algebraic, while the third one is more straightforward mathematically. Maybe starting with Option 3 would give me a better sense of the problem. If that doesn't work or seems too complicated, I can switch to one of the other methods.\n\n### **Step 1: Trying Option 3 \u2013 Squaring Step by Step**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's take it one step at a time. If I square \\(\\sqrt{5}\\), I should get 5. Then, squaring 5 again should give me the final answer. This approach feels intuitive and easy to follow.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{5})^2 = 5\n\\]\n\\[\n5^2 = 25\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait a second\u2014I just squared 5, which seems straightforward, but is that really simplifying \\((\\sqrt{5})^4\\)? I realize now that I jumped ahead a bit. The exponent is 4, not 2, so I should be squaring \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) twice, not just once. Let me re-evaluate this strategy.\n\n### **Step 2: Reassessing Option 3 \u2013 Correcting the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI see where I went wrong. I only squared \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) once instead of twice. Since the exponent is 4, I need to square \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) and then square the result again. Let's try that.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{5})^2 = 5 \\quad \\text{(first squaring)}\n\\]\n\\[\n(5)^2 = 25 \\quad \\text{(second squaring)}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nNow that makes sense. By squaring \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) once, I get 5, and squaring that gives me 25. This aligns with the exponent being 4\u2014essentially, I'm applying the squaring process twice.\n\n**Quick Check:**\nDoes this feel right? Squaring \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) gives 5, which is correct. Squaring 5 to get 25 also checks out. I think we're on the right track.\n\n### **Step 3: Considering Option 1 \u2013 Using Exponent Rules**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's see if applying the property of exponents directly would yield the same result. The property states that \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n}\\). Applying this to \\((\\sqrt{5})^4\\) should simplify it directly.\n\n**Calculation:**\nFirst, express \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) in exponent form:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{5} = 5^{1/2}\n\\]\nNow, apply the exponent rule:\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{5})^4 = (5^{1/2})^4 = 5^{(1/2) \\times 4} = 5^2 = 25\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis approach seems more direct and aligns perfectly with the result we obtained using Option 3. By applying the exponent rule, I reached the same conclusion\u201425.\n\n**Quick Check:**\nBoth methods led to the same result. It feels reassuring to have two different strategies converge on the same answer. This suggests that the solution is likely correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying Correctness**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nBefore finalizing, let's double-check the calculations to ensure no mistakes were made along the way. It's easy to overlook small details, so a quick verification is helpful.\n\n**Check from Option 3:**\n- Squaring \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) gives:\n  \\[\n  (\\sqrt{5})^2 = 5\n  \\]\n- Squaring 5 results in:\n  \\[\n  5^2 = 25\n  \\]\n\n**Check from Option 1:**\n- Expressing \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) as \\(5^{1/2}\\) and applying the exponent rule:\n  \\[\n  (5^{1/2})^4 = 5^{(1/2) \\times 4} = 5^2 = 25\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nBoth checks confirm that the final answer is indeed 25. There were no errors in the calculations, and both methods are consistent.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{5})^4 = 25\n\\]\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBy exploring different strategies\u2014first attempting to square step by step, then applying exponent rules\u2014I was able to verify that \\((\\sqrt{5})^4\\) simplifies to 25. Reflecting and checking my work along the way ensured that the approach was correct and the answer accurate.\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough helps in understanding the thought process behind solving such problems. It's essential to brainstorm, reflect, and verify at each step to ensure a correct and reliable solution.",
