    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's dive into this problem by emulating a human thought process. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check for correctness frequently, and make adjustments as needed. Here's how I'll tackle it:\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- Okay, the problem is asking me to compute \\(\\dbinom{9}{2} \\times \\dbinom{7}{2}\\).\n- I recognize \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) as the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements.\n- But multiplying two binomial coefficients together? That\u2019s not something I do every day. \n- Let me brainstorm: Maybe it relates to selecting multiple groups from different sets?\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n- **Option 1:** Calculate each binomial coefficient separately and then multiply.\n- **Option 2:** Look for a combinatorial interpretation\u2014perhaps there's a way to visualize this problem using combinations.\n- **Option 3:** Consider whether there's a formula or property of binomial coefficients that applies here.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Option 1** seems straightforward: compute \\(\\dbinom{9}{2}\\) and \\(\\dbinom{7}{2}\\) individually and multiply the results.\n- **Option 2** might provide deeper understanding: maybe there's a connection between these coefficients in terms of selecting different groups.\n- **Option 3** could simplify calculations if there's a relevant property or identity.\n\nI think starting with **Option 1** is most pragmatic\u2014calculate each coefficient and then multiply. If things seem off, I\u2019ll explore further.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Compute \\(\\dbinom{9}{2}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- \\(\\dbinom{9}{2}\\) represents the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of 9.\n- The formula for binomial coefficients is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\).\n- Let\u2019s apply that here.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n\\dbinom{9}{2} = \\frac{9!}{2! \\times (9-2)!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 7!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Quick Check:** \\(9 \\times 8 = 72\\); dividing by \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) gives \\(36\\). That seems correct.\n- **Realization:** This makes sense\u2014choosing any 2 out of 9 items, there are 36 possible combinations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Compute \\(\\dbinom{7}{2}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Similarly, \\(\\dbinom{7}{2}\\) is the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of 7.\n- Using the binomial coefficient formula again.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n\\dbinom{7}{2} = \\frac{7!}{2! \\times (7-2)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 5!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{42}{2} = 21\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Quick Check:** \\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\); dividing by \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) gives \\(21\\). That also seems correct.\n- **Insight:** Selecting 2 from 7 has 21 possible combinations. This aligns with the expected outcome.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Multiply the Two Results**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Now, I need to multiply the two binomial coefficients computed: \\(36 \\times 21\\).\n- This step is straightforward arithmetic.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n36 \\times 21 = 756\n\\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- **Quick Check:** Breaking it down: \\(36 \\times 20 = 720\\) and \\(36 \\times 1 = 36\\); adding them gives \\(720 + 36 = 756\\).\n- **Verification:** Double-checking the multiplication confirms the result is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verify the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- I initially selected each binomial coefficient independently and multiplied the results.\n- **Wait, is this the only way?** Perhaps there's a deeper combinatorial meaning or property that I'm missing.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Maybe there's a combinatorial identity that simplifies this calculation.\n- **Thought:** Could \\(\\dbinom{9}{2} \\times \\dbinom{7}{2}\\) represent choosing 2 from two different sets (one of size 9 and the other of size 7)?\n\n**Realization:**\n- This seems like selecting two items where each selection comes from a different pool.\n- **Insight:** The original approach is valid, but understanding the combinatorial context can reinforce the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Combinatorial Interpretation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's explore what \\(\\dbinom{9}{2} \\times \\dbinom{7}{2}\\) might represent in a real-world scenario.\n- Perhaps it's about selecting a team of two members from a larger group, with the team split between two subgroups.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Example Scenario:** Suppose there are 9 engineers and 7 designers. Selecting 2 members where one is an engineer and the other is a designer could be represented by this expression.\n- **Validation:** This aligns with multiplying the number of ways to choose each role independently.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before finalizing, let\u2019s ensure everything aligns.\n- Does the combinatorial interpretation match the arithmetic results?\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Consistency Check:** The arithmetic (756) and the combinatorial interpretation both support each other.\n- **Final Insight:** By approaching it step-by-step and considering multiple strategies, the solution feels robust and correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{9}{2} \\times \\dbinom{7}{2} = 36 \\times 21 = 756\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy approaching the problem methodically\u2014starting with straightforward calculations, reflecting on the process, considering alternative strategies, and verifying through combinatorial interpretation\u2014I\u2019ve confirmed that the answer is indeed \\(756\\). This step-by-step exploration mimics a human thought process, ensuring accuracy and deepening understanding.",
