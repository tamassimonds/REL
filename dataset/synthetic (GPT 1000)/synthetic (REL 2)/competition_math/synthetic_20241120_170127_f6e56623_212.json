    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right. Let's see where this journey takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, looking at the problem:\n\n- **Daniel's Claim:** The popularity of the toaster (number of sales) is **inversely proportional** to its cost.\n- **Given Data:** 12 customers buy a toaster priced at **$500**.\n- **Question:** How many customers would buy a toaster costing **$750**?\n\nMy initial reaction is that this involves inverse proportionality, which is a concept I remember dealing with before. Inverse proportionality means that as one quantity increases, the other decreases, so the product of the two quantities remains constant.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure about the exact steps to set up the relationship mathematically. Let me brainstorm a bit more.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Use Inverse Proportionality Formula:**  \n   I could set up an equation where the product of price and number of sales remains constant.\n\n2. **Proportional Comparison:**  \n   Since the problem involves two different prices, I might compare the two scenarios proportionally to see how the number of sales changes.\n\n3. **Set Up a Simple Ratio Calculation:**  \n   Calculate the ratio of the two prices and apply it to the initial number of sales to find the new number.\n\n4. **Check Using a Constant Product Approach:**  \n   Verify by checking if the product of price and sales remains the same in both scenarios.\n\nLet me start with the **Inverse Proportionality Formula** since it's the most direct approach, and see if it works. If I run into issues, I'll pivot to another strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Inverse Proportionality Equation**\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- Let \\( P \\) be the cost of the toaster.\n- Let \\( S \\) be the number of customers buying the toaster.\n\nDaniel claims that \\( P \\times S = k \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\nGiven:\n\\[ \n500 \\times 12 = k \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nOkay, so if \\( k \\) is constant, then any change in \\( P \\) should inversely affect \\( S \\) such that their product remains \\( k \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nk = 500 \\times 12 = 6000\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nDoes this make sense? Yes, because if the price increases, the number of sales should decrease to keep \\( k \\) constant.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Constant to the New Price**\n\nNow, we need to find \\( S \\) when \\( P = \\$750 \\).\n\n\\[ \n750 \\times S = 6000 \n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI need to solve for \\( S \\). This seems straightforward since I know \\( k \\). But let me double-check if dividing \\( 6000 \\) by \\( 750 \\) directly gives me the correct number of customers.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\nS = \\frac{6000}{750} = 8\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, only 8 customers would buy the toaster at $750? That seems like a significant drop compared to $500. But given the inverse relationship, it actually makes sense because the price is higher, so fewer customers are likely to buy it.\n\n**Verification:**  \nTo ensure correctness, let's check if the product remains constant:\n\n\\[\n750 \\times 8 = 6000\n\\]\n\nYes, it matches the original \\( k \\). So the calculation is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Cross-Checking with Proportional Comparison**\n\nTo be absolutely sure, let's approach it using **Proportional Comparison**.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf the price increases from $500 to $750, what's the ratio of the new price to the old price?\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Price Ratio} = \\frac{750}{500} = 1.5 \n\\]\n\nSince the relationship is inverse, the number of customers should decrease by this ratio.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{New Sales} = \\frac{12}{1.5} = 8\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis method also gives me 8 customers, confirming that the initial approach was correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Simplifying with Ratio Calculation**\n\nTo simplify further, let's use **Simple Ratio Calculation**.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe ratio of the two prices is \\( \\frac{750}{500} = 1.5 \\). Since the sales are inversely proportional, the ratio of sales should be the reciprocal, \\( \\frac{1}{1.5} \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n\\text{New Sales} = 12 \\times \\frac{1}{1.5} = 8\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nAgain, this leads to 8 customers. This reaffirms that the number of sales at $750 is indeed 8.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection and Verification**\n\nAt this point, I've approached the problem using multiple strategies:\n\n1. **Inverse Proportionality Formula:** Direct calculation using \\( P \\times S = k \\).\n2. **Proportional Comparison:** Analyzing the price ratio and applying it to sales.\n3. **Simple Ratio Calculation:** Using the reciprocal of the price ratio for sales.\n\nAll methods consistently lead to the same result: **8 customers** would buy the toaster at $750.\n\n**Does This Make Sense?**  \nYes, it aligns with the concept of inverse proportionality. As the price increases, the number of customers decreases to maintain the constant product.\n\n**Potential Pitfall:**  \nInitially, I thought the drop from 12 to 8 customers was significant. However, given the 50% increase in price ($500 to $750), a proportional decrease in sales to maintain the constant \\( k \\) is logical.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the calculations, the final answer is **8 customers** would buy a toaster costing $750. By reflecting at each step and cross-checking with multiple methods, I ensured the solution is accurate and consistent.",

  "ground_truth": "Let the popularity of a toaster (or the number of customers who buy the appliance) equal $p$, and let the cost of the toaster equal $c$. According to Daniel's theory, $p$ and $c$ are inversely proportional. Thus, $(p)(c)=k$ for some constant value $k$. If $p=12$ when $c=500$, then $k=(12)(500)=6000$. So when $c=750$, \\begin{align*} (p)(c)&=k\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (p)(750)&=6000\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad p&=\\frac{6000}{750}\n\\\\ &=\\boxed{8}.\n\\end{align*}According to Daniel's theory, 8 customers would buy the $\\$750$ toaster."
