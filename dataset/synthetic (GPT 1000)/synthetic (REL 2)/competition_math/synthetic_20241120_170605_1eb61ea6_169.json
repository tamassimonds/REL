I'll brainstorm different strategies, explore various approaches, reflect often, and check my work frequently to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nWhen I first see the problem, it mentions that the integer \\( x \\) has 12 positive factors and that both 12 and 15 are factors of \\( x \\). I need to find out what \\( x \\) is.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Prime Factorization:** Maybe start by looking at the prime factors of 12 and 15 since they must be part of \\( x \\).\n- **Multiple of 12 and 15:** Since both 12 and 15 are factors, perhaps \\( x \\) is a multiple of both. But to narrow it down, it should also have exactly 12 factors.\n- **Divisors and Their Count:** Reflect on how the number of factors is determined by prime factorization.\n\n**Reflection:**\nOkay, so \\( x \\) must be a multiple of both 12 and 15. But knowing that helps narrow down potential candidates. I think starting with prime factorization might give me a clearer picture.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Prime Factorization of 12 and 15**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nLet's break down 12 and 15 into their prime factors to see what primes need to be in \\( x \\).\n\n- **12:** \\( 12 = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\)\n- **15:** \\( 15 = 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nSo, \\( x \\) must have at least \\( 2^2 \\), \\( 3^1 \\), and \\( 5^1 \\) in its prime factorization. This makes sense because \\( x \\) needs to be divisible by both 12 and 15.\n\n**Check:**\nWait, does this align with having exactly 12 factors? Let me recall how the number of factors is determined.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Determining the Number of Factors Based on Prime Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI remember that the number of positive divisors (factors) of a number is found by adding 1 to each of the exponents in its prime factorization and then multiplying these together.\n\n**Formula:**\nIf \\( x = p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_n^{a_n} \\), then the number of factors \\( = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\times \\ldots \\times (a_n + 1) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nGiven that \\( x \\) has 12 factors, I need to see how the exponents can be arranged to satisfy this condition, considering that \\( x \\) must include \\( 2^2 \\), \\( 3^1 \\), and \\( 5^1 \\).\n\n**Check:**\nLet me list possible combinations of exponents that multiply to 12 when added by one.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Listing Possible Combinations of Exponents**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI need to find combinations of exponents that, when each is increased by one and multiplied together, equal 12.\n\n**Possible Combinations:**\n- \\( 12 = 3 \\times 2 \\)\n- \\( 12 = 4 \\times 3 \\)\n- \\( 12 = 6 \\times 2 \\)\n- \\( 12 = 6 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\)\n  \n**Assigning Exponents:**\nGiven that the primes are \\( 2, 3, \\) and \\( 5 \\), let's see how they can fit:\n\n1. **\\( 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\)**: \\( (3 + 1)(2 + 1) = 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\)\n2. **\\( 2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\)**: \\( (4 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 5 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 20 \\) \u2014 Too high.\n3. **\\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\)**: \\( (2 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 18 \\) \u2014 Too high.\n4. **\\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\)**: \\( (2 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 12 \\) \u2014 Correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait a minute, only \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\) gives exactly 12 factors. But this seems less than what was initially thought. Let me reconsider the exponent distribution.\n\n**Check:**\nLet me verify if this combination indeed satisfies having 12 factors and includes both 12 and 15.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Correct Exponent Combination**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI need to ensure that \\( x \\) not only has 12 factors but also includes both 12 and 15 as factors. This means \\( x \\) must be divisible by both \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\) and \\( 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\nFrom the previous step, the candidate is \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\).\n\nLet's check:\n\n- **Includes 12:** \n  - \\( 12 = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\)\n  - All prime factors are present and correct exponents are met.\n\n- **Includes 15:**\n  - \\( 15 = 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\)\n  - Again, all prime factors are present.\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\) includes both 12 and 15, and the number of factors is correctly calculated as 12. But to be sure, let's calculate the actual number \\( x \\).\n\n**Check:**\nIs there another combination that also satisfies all conditions? Since \\( 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\) is the only one that meets the factor count and includes both 12 and 15, I think this is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating the Value of \\( x \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I have the prime factorization, let's compute \\( x \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[ \nx = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 60 \n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nAlright, \\( x = 60 \\). Let's double-check if 60 indeed has 12 factors and includes both 12 and 15.\n\n**Check:**\n- **Does 60 have 12 factors?**\n  \n  - Prime Factorization: \\( 60 = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\)\n  - Number of Factors: \\( (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 12 \\) \u2014 Correct.\n\n- **Are 12 and 15 factors of 60?**\n  \n  - \\( 12 = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\) \u2014 Divides 60.\n  - \\( 15 = 3^1 \\times 5^1 \\) \u2014 Divides 60.\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. \\( x = 60 \\) meets all the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nThroughout this problem, brainstorming different strategies helped me identify the importance of prime factorization in understanding the number of factors. Initially, considering multiples of 12 and 15 led me to explore their prime factors, which then guided me to determine the correct combination of exponents. By verifying each step\u2014especially ensuring that both 12 and 15 were factors and that the total number of factors was 12\u2014I confirmed that \\( x = 60 \\) was indeed the correct solution.\n\nReflecting frequently and checking my work ensured that I caught any potential missteps early, leading to a confident and accurate conclusion.",
