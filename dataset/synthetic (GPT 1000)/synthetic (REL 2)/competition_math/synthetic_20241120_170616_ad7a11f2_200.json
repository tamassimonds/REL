    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem step-by-step, emulating a human thought process complete with brainstorming, exploring various strategies, reflecting, and checking our work frequently. I'll start by diving into understanding the problem, then brainstorm possible approaches, explore each method, adjust as needed, and keep verifying our steps. Let's make it as natural as possible.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\n**User Query:**\nThe function \\( f(x) \\) satisfies\n\\[\nb^2 f(a) = a^2 f(b)\n\\]\nfor all real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). If \\( f(2) \\neq 0 \\), find\n\\[\n\\frac{f(5) - f(1)}{f(2)}.\n\\]\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- This looks like a functional equation involving symmetry between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n- The equation \\( b^2 f(a) = a^2 f(b) \\) suggests a relationship that might be useful for finding a general form of \\( f(x) \\).\n- Since \\( f(2) \\neq 0 \\), it could be a important reference point.\n- I must find \\( \\frac{f(5) - f(1)}{f(2)} \\), which involves values at 5, 1, and 2. Perhaps I can derive \\( f(5) \\) and \\( f(1) \\) in terms of \\( f(2) \\).\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n1. **Substitution Method:** Insert specific values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to simplify the equation and possibly find a pattern or form for \\( f(x) \\).\n2. **Propose a Form for \\( f(x) \\):** Guess that \\( f(x) \\) could be a polynomial or another simple function and verify if it satisfies the equation.\n3. **Check for Linear or Polynomial Solutions:** Given that functional equations often lead to linear solutions, consider if \\( f(x) \\) is linear.\n4. **Exploit Symmetry:** Use the symmetry in the equation to derive relationships between different values of \\( f(x) \\).\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- I'll start with the **Substitution Method** to see if plugging in specific values yields useful information.\n- If that doesn't work, I'll move to proposing a general form for \\( f(x) \\) and see if it fits.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting the Substitution Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's substitute specific values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to see what relationships we can uncover.\n\n**Substituting \\( a = b = 1 \\):**\n\\[\n1^2 f(1) = 1^2 f(1) \\implies f(1) = f(1)\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n- This doesn't give any new information. It's trivially true.\n\n**Substituting \\( a = b = 2 \\):**\n\\[\n2^2 f(2) = 2^2 f(2) \\implies f(2) = f(2)\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n- Again, this is trivial and doesn't help.\n\n**Substituting \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 1 \\):**\n\\[\n1^2 f(2) = 2^2 f(1) \\implies f(2) = 4 f(1)\n\\]\n**Insight:**\n- This gives a direct relationship between \\( f(2) \\) and \\( f(1) \\): \\( f(1) = \\frac{1}{4} f(2) \\).\n\n**Substituting \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 5 \\):**\n\\[\n5^2 f(2) = 2^2 f(5) \\implies 25 f(2) = 4 f(5)\n\\]\n**Insight:**\n- This relates \\( f(2) \\) to \\( f(5) \\): \\( f(5) = \\frac{25}{4} f(2) \\).\n\n**Checking Work:**\n- So far, we've established:\n  \\[\n  f(1) = \\frac{1}{4} f(2)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  f(5) = \\frac{25}{4} f(2)\n  \\]\n- This seems consistent, and no contradictions arise.\n\n**Next Step:**\n- Use these relationships to express \\( \\frac{f(5) - f(1)}{f(2)} \\) in terms of \\( f(2) \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating \\( \\frac{f(5) - f(1)}{f(2)} \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Substitute the expressions for \\( f(5) \\) and \\( f(1) \\) in terms of \\( f(2) \\) into the given fraction.\n\n**Substitutions:**\n\\[\n\\frac{f(5) - f(1)}{f(2)} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{25}{4} f(2)\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{4} f(2)\\right)}{f(2)}\n\\]\n**Simplifying the Numerator:**\n\\[\n\\frac{25}{4} f(2) - \\frac{1}{4} f(2) = \\left(\\frac{25}{4} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right) f(2) = \\frac{24}{4} f(2) = 6 f(2)\n\\]\n**Fraction Becomes:**\n\\[\n\\frac{6 f(2)}{f(2)} = 6\n\\]\n**Reflection:**\n- The \\( f(2) \\) terms cancel out, and we're left with 6.\n- This looks clean, and the cancellation suggests the solution might be correct.\n\n**Checking Work:**\n- Before finalizing, let's ensure there are no hidden assumptions.\n- The relationships derived were consistent, and substituting back into the original equation holds true.\n\n**Next Step:**\n- Confirm that this approach is valid and that no other solutions exist.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To ensure the solution is correct, let's check if the proposed relationships satisfy the original functional equation.\n\n**Rechecking Substitutions:**\n1. **Substituting \\( f(1) = \\frac{1}{4} f(2) \\) and \\( f(5) = \\frac{25}{4} f(2) \\):**\n   - For \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 5 \\):\n     \\[\n     5^2 f(1) = 1^2 f(5) \\implies 25 \\times \\frac{1}{4} f(2) = f(5) \\implies \\frac{25}{4} f(2) = f(5)\n     \\]\n   - This is consistent with our earlier finding.\n\n2. **Substituting \\( f(2) \\) into the Other Equation:**\n   - For \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     1^2 f(2) = 2^2 f(1) \\implies f(2) = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} f(2) = f(2)\n     \\]\n   - This is trivially true and confirms consistency.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- All substitutions hold true.\n- The relationships satisfy the original equation, confirming the solution's validity.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- The calculations were straightforward.\n- No contradictions or errors detected throughout the process.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The value of \\( \\frac{f(5) - f(1)}{f(2)} \\) is **6**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Approach Worked:** Starting with substitutions provided key relationships that led directly to the solution.\n- **Flexibility in Strategy:** If the initial substitutions hadn't worked, exploring different forms for \\( f(x) \\) would have been the next step.\n- **Importance of Verification:** Checking that all derived relationships satisfy the original equation ensured the correctness of the solution.\n- **Natural Thinking Flow:** Reflecting, checking, and adjusting throughout made the process smooth and error-free.\n\nBy maintaining a human-like thought process\u2014brainstorming, exploring, reflecting, and verifying\u2014we arrived confidently at the solution.",
