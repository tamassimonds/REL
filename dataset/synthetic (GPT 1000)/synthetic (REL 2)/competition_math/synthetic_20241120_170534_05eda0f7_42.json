    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and see where our brainstorming takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we have a point \\((3,6)\\) on the graph of \\(y = g(x)\\). Then, there's a function \\(h(x) = (g(x))^2\\). We're told that there's one specific point that must be on the graph of \\(y = h(x)\\). The goal is to find this point and then determine the sum of its coordinates.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Familiarity:** This reminds me of function composition and transformations we've dealt with before, especially squaring a function.\n  \n- **Brainstorming:** Maybe I need to find \\(h(x)\\) based on the given point on \\(g(x)\\). So, perhaps calculating \\(h(3)\\) since \\(g(3) = 6\\) could be a starting point.\n\n- **Confusion:** Wait, but the question mentions \"one point that must be on the graph of \\(y = h(x)\\).\" Does this imply there's a specific \\(x\\) value we're supposed to find?\n\n**Reflection: Mixed Emotions**\n\nAt first glance, it seems straightforward\u2014just plug in the known \\(x\\) value into \\(h(x)\\). But the wording about \"one point\" being necessary makes me think there's more to explore. Maybe there's a general \\(x\\) value that always works, or perhaps it's referring to \\(h(3)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Initial Brainstorming**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet me try calculating \\(h(3)\\) since we know \\(g(3) = 6\\). If this works, maybe it's the answer. If not, I'll reconsider my approach.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nh(3) = (g(3))^2 = 6^2 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Result:**\n\nSo, the point \\((3, 36)\\) is on the graph of \\(y = h(x)\\).\n\n**But Wait...**\n\nThe question asks for \"the sum of the coordinates of that point.\" The point \\((3, 36)\\) has a sum of \\(39\\). Is this the expected answer?\n\n**Check:**\n\nHmm, but the question emphasizes that there is \"one point that must be on the graph.\" Is \\((3, 36)\\) unique, or could there be other points? Should I explore further to ensure this is the only point?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Reevaluating the Approach**\n\n**Realization:**\n\nMaybe \\(h(3) = 36\\) is correct, but the question might be hinting at something more general or different from just plugging in \\(x = 3\\).\n\n**Alternate Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Conceptual Understanding:** \\(h(x) = (g(x))^2\\) means that for any \\(x\\), if \\(g(x)\\) is known, \\(h(x)\\) is determined by squaring \\(g(x)\\).\n\n- **Exploring Different Strategies:** Maybe I need to consider other values of \\(x\\) where \\(g(x)\\) is known or think about the implications of squaring \\(g(x)\\).\n\n- **Looking for Patterns:** If \\(g(3) = 6\\), perhaps \\(g(x)\\) has other values that relate to \\(x = 3\\), or maybe squaring imposes specific constraints.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nLet me consider whether there are other points on \\(h(x)\\) that are guaranteed by the properties of \\(g(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Delving Deeper into Function Properties**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSquaring a function typically ensures that all output values \\(h(x)\\) are non-negative, regardless of the sign of \\(g(x)\\). This might be a clue.\n\n**Exploring Strategies:**\n\n1. **Symmetry Consideration:** If \\(g(x) = 6\\), then \\(-g(x) = -6\\) would also be a point on \\(g(x)\\). Squaring this would yield the same \\(h(x)\\) value.\n\n2. **Function Composition Insight:** Since \\(h(x)\\) is derived by squaring \\(g(x)\\), perhaps there's a broader relationship between \\(g(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait a minute\u2014if \\(g(x) = -6\\) at some point, then \\(h(x)\\) would also be \\(36\\). Does this imply that there are multiple \\(x\\) values leading to the same \\(h(x)\\) output? But the question specifies \"one point.\" This might be pointing towards something unique about the squaring process.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Considering the Given Point and Its Implications**\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\nSo, we know \\(g(3) = 6\\). If \\(g(x)\\) could also be \\(-6\\), then:\n\n- For \\(x = 3\\), \\(h(3) = 36\\).\n- But potentially, \\(h(x)\\) could also be \\(36\\) if \\(g(x) = -6\\).\n\n**But...**\n\nThe question emphasizes that **there is one point** that must be on the graph of \\(y = h(x)\\). This suggests that perhaps only one specific \\(x\\) value relates to the given \\(g(3) = 6\\).\n\n**Possible Conclusion:**\n\nPerhaps the point \\((3, 36)\\) is indeed unique in the sense that it's directly tied to the given information. Although squaring \\(g(x)\\) could yield multiple points, the question pinpoints \\((3, 36)\\) as the necessary one.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finalizing the Approach**\n\n**Confirming the Strategy:**\n\nBased on the given point \\((3, 6)\\) on \\(g(x)\\), calculating \\(h(3) = 36\\) seems correct. The uniqueness aspect might stem from the specific \\(x = 3\\) being provided.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nh(3) = (g(3))^2 = 6^2 = 36\n\\]\n\n**Resulting Point:**\n\n\\((3, 36)\\)\n\n**Sum of Coordinates:**\n\n\\(3 + 36 = 39\\)\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n\\(\\boxed{39}\\) is the sum of the coordinates of the point that must be on the graph of \\(y = h(x)\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nInitially, considering just \\(h(3) = 36\\) seemed too straightforward. Reflecting on the uniqueness requirement helped confirm that while multiple points could exist on \\(h(x)\\), the specific context of \\(g(3) = 6\\) uniquely leads us to \\((3, 36)\\).\n\n- **Check:** Throughout, I ensured that the uniqueness aspect aligned with the given information.\n  \n- **Insights:** The relation between \\(g(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) through squaring clarified the path to the solution.\n\n- **Mistakes Avoided:** Initially, I considered the possibility of multiple points due to squaring, but refining the focus to the given \\(x = 3\\) aligned with the problem's requirements.\n\nBy approaching the problem step by step, reflecting frequently, and being open to adjusting the strategy, we arrive at \\(\\boxed{39}\\) confidently.",
