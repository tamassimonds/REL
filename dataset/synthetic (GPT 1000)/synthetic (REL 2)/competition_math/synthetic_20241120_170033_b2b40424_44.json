    "working_out": "Sure! Let's tackle this problem just as I would if I were solving it myself, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and checking to ensure the approach is correct. Here we go!\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst thoughts:\n\n- **What is a palindrome?** I remember it's a number that reads the same forward and backward, like `12321` or `4884`.\n- **What are we looking for?** The problem asks for the number of **4-digit palindromes**.\n- **Initial Reaction:** This reminds me of pattern recognition problems, where the structure of the number is crucial.\n\nPossible strategies come to mind:\n\n1. **Pattern Analysis:** Look at the structure of 4-digit palindromes.\n2. **Enumerate Possible Cases:** Count all possible combinations that fit the palindrome criteria.\n3. **Mathematical Formula:** Use a formula if there's one for counting palindromes.\n\nLet me start by examining the structure of a 4-digit palindrome to see if that leads somewhere.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Analyzing the Structure of a 4-Digit Palindrome**\n\nThought process:\n\n- **What does a 4-digit number look like?** It has four digits: `abcd`.\n- **For it to be a palindrome:** `a` must equal `d`, and `b` must equal `c`. So, the number is actually `abba`.\n\nReflection:\n\n- **Wait, that reduces the complexity!** Only the first two digits determine the number, as the last two are a mirror of the first two.\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, because for a number to read the same backward, the digits must be symmetrical.\n\nCalculation:\n\n- **Possible choices:**\n  - `a` (the first digit) cannot be `0` (since it's a 4-digit number), so `a` has 9 options: `1-9`.\n  - `b` (the second digit) can be any digit from `0-9`, so `b` has 10 options.\n\n- **Total combinations:** Multiply the number of choices for `a` and `b`.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Total palindromes} = 9 \\times 10 = 90\n  \\]\n\nCheck:\n\n- **Does 90 seem reasonable?** Yes, because we're constrained by the first two digits, and each combination uniquely defines a palindrome.\n\nNatural reflection:\n\n- **Hmm, it feels correct, but let\u2019s double-check by listing a few examples:**\n  - For `a = 1`, `b` could be `0-9`: `1001`, `1111`, `1221`, ..., `1991`.\n  - For `a = 2`, `b` could be `0-9`: `2002`, `2112`, `2222`, ..., `2992`.\n  \n- **Would repeating this for all `a` values reach 90?**\n  - Yes, each `a` (from `1` to `9`) has 10 corresponding `b` values.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Validating the Approach by Listing Palindromes**\n\nThought process:\n\n- **Is there another method to validate?** Maybe by explicitly listing out some palindromes to see if the count adds up.\n- **Does this confirm the earlier calculation?** It should, if the pattern holds.\n\nAction:\n\n- **List palindromes for each `a`:**\n  - `a = 1`: `1001`, `1111`, `1221`, `1331`, `1441`, `1551`, `1661`, `1771`, `1881`, `1991` \u2192 **10 palindromes**\n  - `a = 2`: `2002`, `2112`, `2222`, `2332`, `2442`, `2552`, `2662`, `2772`, `2882`, `2992` \u2192 **10 palindromes**\n  - Continue this up to `a = 9`.\n\nCalculation:\n\n- **Total palindromes listed:**\n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ (for each } a\\text{ from } 1 \\text{ to } 9) \\times 9 = 90\n  \\]\n\nCheck:\n\n- **Does the total match the earlier calculation?** Yes, both methods lead to 90.\n\nNatural reflection:\n\n- **This confirms the approach is correct.** Listing a few sets aligns perfectly with the initial calculated total.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring Another Strategy to Reinforce the Solution**\n\nThought process:\n\n- **Is there another way to think about it?** Perhaps by considering how many digits can be independently chosen.\n- **Checking if this aligns with our current approach.**\n\nAction:\n\n- **First digit (`a`):** 9 options (`1-9`).\n- **Second digit (`b`):** 10 options (`0-9`).\n- **Third digit (`c`):** Must match `b` for the number to be a palindrome.\n- **Fourth digit (`d`):** Must match `a` for the same reason.\n\nCalculation:\n\n- **Total independent choices:**\n  \\[\n  9 \\text{ (for } a\\text{)} \\times 10 \\text{ (for } b\\text{)} = 90\n  \\]\n  \n- **Recognizing dependencies:**\n  \\[\n  c \\text{ and } d \\text{ are not independently chosen; they mirror } b \\text{ and } a\\text{, respectively.}\n  \\]\n  \nCheck:\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, because once `a` and `b` are chosen, the palindrome structure is fixed.\n\nNatural reflection:\n\n- **Reinforces that the total is 90.** No additional palindromes are created beyond what's already counted.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Final Check and Conclusion**\n\nThought process:\n\n- **Is there anything I've missed?** Perhaps edge cases or particular constraints, but I believe we've covered the structure comprehensively.\n- **Does the number `90` make intuitive sense?** Given the constraints of a 4-digit palindrome, it feels right.\n\nAction:\n\n- **Final check:** Ensure that each combination of `a` and `b` uniquely determines a palindrome without overlap or duplication.\n- **Verification:** Different `a` and `b` values produce distinct palindromes.\n\nCalculation:\n\n- **Total confirmed:** 90 unique 4-digit palindromes.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- **The number of 4-digit palindromes is** **90**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:** Analyzing the palindrome structure was effective in simplifying the problem.\n- **Alternative Verification:** Listing a few palindromes and understanding the dependencies reinforced the total count.\n- **Confidence in Solution:** The number `90` aligns with multiple approaches, ensuring the solution's correctness.\n- **Mistakes or Adjustments:** None identified; the approach consistently led to the correct answer throughout.\n\nOverall, brainstorming different strategies, continuously reflecting on the correctness, and verifying through multiple methods ensured a thorough and accurate solution.",
