    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm different strategies, explore each step thoroughly, and reflect often to ensure I'm on the right track. The goal is to evaluate \\(i^{11} + i^{111}\\).\n\n### Step 1: **Understanding the Problem**\n\nFirst thoughts:\n\n- **Familiarity:** This looks like dealing with complex numbers, specifically powers of \\(i\\). I remember that \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit where \\(i^2 = -1\\).\n- **Possible Strategies:** Maybe there's a pattern in the powers of \\(i\\), or perhaps using Euler's formula could help. Alternatively, modular arithmetic might work given the exponents.\n- **Brainstorming:** Should I list out the first few powers of \\(i\\) to see if a pattern emerges? Or perhaps consider using the properties of exponents?\n\n**Reflection:** Listing powers seems straightforward, but maybe there's a more abstract approach that can save time for larger exponents like 111.\n\n### Step 2: **Exploring the Pattern in Powers of \\(i\\)**\n\nLet\u2019s start by calculating the first few powers of \\(i\\):\n\n- \\(i^1 = i\\)\n- \\(i^2 = -1\\)\n- \\(i^3 = i \\times i^2 = i \\times -1 = -i\\)\n- \\(i^4 = i \\times i^3 = i \\times -i = -i^2 = 1\\)\n\n**Observations:**\n\n- **Repetition:** I notice that every four powers, \\(i\\) cycles back to 1: \\(i^4 = 1\\), \\(i^5 = i\\), and so on.\n- **Pattern:** This suggests that powers of \\(i\\) repeat every four exponents: \\(i^{n} = i^{n \\mod 4}\\).\n\n**Reflection:** This periodicity is helpful. It means I only need to consider the exponents modulo 4 to simplify calculations.\n\n### Step 3: **Applying the Pattern to Simplify Exponents**\n\nGiven the pattern, let's simplify \\(i^{11}\\) and \\(i^{111}\\):\n\n- **For \\(i^{11}\\):**\n  - \\(11 \\mod 4 = 3\\)\n  - So, \\(i^{11} = i^3 = -i\\)\n\n- **For \\(i^{111}\\):**\n  - \\(111 \\mod 4 = 3\\)\n  - Therefore, \\(i^{111} = i^3 = -i\\)\n\n**Reflection:** Both exponents reduce to \\(i^3\\), which is \\(-i\\). This simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n### Step 4: **Calculating the Sum**\n\nNow, let's add the two simplified terms together:\n\n\\[\ni^{11} + i^{111} = -i + (-i) = -2i\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Does adding \\(-i\\) and \\(-i\\) make sense? Yes, combining the imaginary parts gives \\(-2i\\).\n\n**Reflection:** The calculation seems straightforward and correct. The periodicity observation saved us from dealing with higher exponents directly.\n\n### Step 5: **Double-Checking the Approach**\n\nWait a moment, let's ensure everything aligns:\n\n- **Does \\(i^{11} = -i\\) and \\(i^{111} = -i\\)?** Yes, because both exponents reduce to 3 modulo 4.\n- **Does adding \\(-i\\) and \\(-i\\) result in \\(-2i\\)?** Yes, the arithmetic checks out.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** The approach is consistent, and the checks confirm the correctness of each step. The periodicity of \\(i\\) was key in simplifying the problem.\n\n### Step 6: **Considering Alternative Strategies**\n\nAlthough the pattern method worked well, let's briefly explore other strategies to ensure completeness:\n\n- **Euler's Formula:** Could Euler\u2019s formula \\(e^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)\\) be applied? Since \\(i = e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\), perhaps exponentiating could work.\n  \n  - **Attempt:** Compute \\(i^{11} = (e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{2}})^{11} = e^{i\\frac{11\\pi}{2}} = e^{i\\frac{3\\pi}{2}} = -i\\). Similarly, \\(i^{111} = e^{i\\frac{111\\pi}{2}} = -i\\).\n  \n  - **Result:** This also gives us \\(-i\\) for both exponents, leading to the same sum: \\(-2i\\).\n\n**Reflection:** Euler's formula confirms the result but adds complexity compared to the straightforward modular approach. It\u2019s good to know multiple methods, but the simplest one is often best.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying each step, the evaluation \\(i^{11} + i^{111}\\) equals \\(-2i\\). Using the periodicity of powers of \\(i\\) was the most efficient approach, simplifying the problem considerably.\n\n**Lesson Learned:** Identifying patterns can significantly streamline calculations in problems involving powers of complex numbers. Always consider checking your work and exploring alternative methods to ensure accuracy and deepen understanding.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed walkthrough showcases the thought process, multiple strategies, reflections, and checks that a human would naturally employ when tackling such a problem.",

  "ground_truth": "The powers of $i$ repeat every four powers: $i^1=i$, $i^2=-1$, $i^3=-i$, $i^4=1$, $i^5=i$, $i^6=-1$ and so on. So to determine $i^n$, where $n$ is an integer, we only need to find the remainder of $n$ when it is divided by 4. The remainder of both 11 and 111 when divided by 4 is 3, so $i^{11} + i^{111} = i^3 + i^3 = -i + (-i) = \\boxed{-2i}$."
