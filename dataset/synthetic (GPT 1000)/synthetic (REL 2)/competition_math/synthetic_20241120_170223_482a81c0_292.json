    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would if I were tackling it on paper. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed. Let\u2019s begin by truly understanding the question.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question is asking for the **slope of the line** determined by any two solutions to the equation \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{x} + \\frac{3}{y} = 0\n\\]\n\nWhen I first see this, I think:\n\n- **This looks like a rational equation.** Maybe I can manipulate it into a form I\u2019m more familiar with.\n- **It reminds me of linear equations** like \\( y = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope. But here, the variables are in the denominators, which is a bit different.\n- **I could try rearranging it** to see if I can get it into a slope-intercept form.\n- **Alternatively, maybe plotting points** would help, but that seems tedious without a clear strategy.\n- **Another option is to find two solutions** and then compute the slope between them.\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards **rearranging the equation** to make it look more like a standard linear equation. If that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll try finding specific solutions and calculating the slope from there.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Algebraic Rearrangement:**\n   - Try to isolate \\( y \\) or \\( x \\) to get the equation into a linear form.\n   \n2. **Find Specific Solutions:**\n   - Pick specific values for \\( x \\) or \\( y \\) to find corresponding solutions and then calculate the slope.\n\n3. **Graphical Interpretation:**\n   - Consider what the graph of this equation would look like, though this might be abstract without plotting.\n\n4. **Substitution Method:**\n   - Perhaps introducing a new variable could simplify the equation.\n\nLet\u2019s start with **Algebraic Rearrangement** to see if I can get the equation into a familiar linear form.\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting Algebraic Rearrangement**\n\nI\u2019ll try to rearrange \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{x} + \\frac{3}{y} = 0\n\\]\n\ninto something like \\( y = mx + b \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- To get rid of the fractions, I could multiply both sides by \\( xy \\) to eliminate the denominators.\n- This would give me a polynomial equation, which might be easier to work with.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( xy \\):\n\n\\[\nxy \\left( \\frac{2}{x} + \\frac{3}{y} \\right) = xy \\cdot 0\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2y + 3x = 0\n\\]\n\nWait a second... **Reflection:**\n\n- **That worked!** Now the equation is linear in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n- **This looks like a standard linear equation** where I can identify the slope.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Slope**\n\nNow that I have \n\n\\[\n2y + 3x = 0\n\\]\n\nI can rearrange it into slope-intercept form (\\( y = mx + b \\)).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Isolate \\( y \\):** This will make it clear what the slope is.\n- **Check if the equation is correct:** Make sure no errors occurred during rearrangement.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nSubtract \\( 3x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2y = -3x\n\\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{3}{2}x\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- **This makes sense.** The equation is now in slope-intercept form, where the slope \\( m \\) is \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\).\n- **Reflection:** **So, the slope is \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\).** That seems reasonable because the coefficients were \\( 2 \\) and \\( 3 \\), and dividing \\( -3x \\) by 2 gives \\( -\\frac{3}{2}x \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying by Finding Two Solutions**\n\nJust to be sure, let\u2019s find two specific solutions to the original equation and calculate the slope between them.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Pick two easy values for \\( x \\) or \\( y \\):** This will help me find corresponding \\( y \\) or \\( x \\) values.\n- **Calculate the slope using these points:** This should match the slope we found algebraically.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet\u2019s pick \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{3}{y} = 0 \\implies 1 + \\frac{3}{y} = 0 \\implies \\frac{3}{y} = -1 \\implies y = -3\n\\]\n\nSo, one solution is \\( (2, -3) \\).\n\nNow, pick \\( x = -2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{-2} + \\frac{3}{y} = 0 \\implies -1 + \\frac{3}{y} = 0 \\implies \\frac{3}{y} = 1 \\implies y = 3\n\\]\n\nAnother solution is \\( (-2, 3) \\).\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- **Both solutions satisfy the original equation.** \n   - For \\( (2, -3) \\): \\( \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{3}{-3} = 1 - 1 = 0 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n   - For \\( (-2, 3) \\): \\( \\frac{2}{-2} + \\frac{3}{3} = -1 + 1 = 0 \\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Slope Between These Points**\n\nNow, let\u2019s calculate the slope \\( m \\) between the points \\( (2, -3) \\) and \\( (-2, 3) \\).\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Use the slope formula:** \n  \\[\n  m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n  \\]\n- **Plug in the values:** This should confirm the slope we calculated earlier.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nLet\u2019s assign:\n\n- \\( (x_1, y_1) = (2, -3) \\)\n- \\( (x_2, y_2) = (-2, 3) \\)\n\nNow, plug into the slope formula:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{3 - (-3)}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{3 + 3}{-4} = \\frac{6}{-4} = -\\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Perfect!** The slope is \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\), which matches our earlier calculation.\n- **This confirms that our algebraic rearrangement was correct.**\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Substitution Method**\n\nJust to explore another strategy, suppose I introduced a new variable to simplify the equation.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Let\u2019s define a new variable:** For example, \\( u = \\frac{1}{x} \\) and \\( v = \\frac{1}{y} \\).\n- **Rewriting the equation:** This transforms the original equation into \\( 2u + 3v = 0 \\), which is linear in terms of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{x} + \\frac{3}{y} = 0 \\implies 2u + 3v = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( v \\):\n\n\\[\n3v = -2u \\implies v = -\\frac{2}{3}u\n\\]\n\nNow, recall that \\( v = \\frac{1}{y} \\) and \\( u = \\frac{1}{x} \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y} = -\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} \\implies y = -\\frac{3}{2}x\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- **This is the same equation** we got earlier: \\( y = -\\frac{3}{2}x \\).\n- **Thus, the slope remains \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\).**\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Both methods agree:** Whether I rearranged the original equation algebraically or introduced new variables, the slope consistently came out to be \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\).\n- **Verification with specific points:** Calculating the slope between two solutions confirmed our initial calculation.\n- **Alternative approach validated:** The substitution method provided the same result, reinforcing the correctness of the solution.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying with specific points, and checking the consistency of results, **the slope of the line determined by any two solutions to the equation** \n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{x} + \\frac{3}{y} = 0\n\\]\n\n**is \\( -\\frac{3}{2} \\).**",

  "ground_truth": "We can quickly see that we can get a solution to the equation if the first fraction is 1 and the second is -1 which gives $(x, y) = (2, -3)$.  Similarly if we let $(x, y) = (-2, 3)$ we get the first fraction to be $-1$ and the second to be 1.  The slope of the line through these two points is $\\frac{-3 - 3}{2 - (-2)} = \\boxed{- \\frac 32}$."
