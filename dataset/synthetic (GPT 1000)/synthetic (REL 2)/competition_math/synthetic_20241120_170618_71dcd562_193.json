    "working_out": "Let's tackle this problem by thinking through it step by step, exploring different strategies, and reflecting often to ensure each approach is correct. I'll brainstorm various methods, check my work frequently, and adjust my approach as needed\u2014just like how I would naturally think through a problem.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first look at the problem, it involves both addition and multiplication of two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), with a constraint on their sum. This reminds me of systems of equations, but there's also a quadratic aspect due to the multiplication. My initial thought is to set up equations based on the given information and see where that leads me.\n\nI notice two main equations:\n1. \\(a + b = 24\\)\n2. \\(2ab + 10a = 3b + 222\\)\n\nThe first equation is straightforward, but the second one looks more complicated because it involves both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in different terms. I\u2019m not sure if solving them simultaneously would be the best starting point, so I\u2019ll brainstorm other strategies as well.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Substitution Method**: Solve the first equation for one variable and substitute it into the second equation. This seems like a standard approach for systems of equations.\n\n2. **Elimination Method**: Try to eliminate one variable by manipulating the equations. This might simplify the second equation.\n\n3. **Express \\(ab\\) in Terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**: Since we need \\(ab\\), maybe I can transform the equations to express \\(ab\\) directly.\n\n4. **Check for Simplifications**: Look for common factors or ways to simplify the second equation before diving into solving.\n\n5. **Verify with Sample Values**: Given that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers, perhaps testing a few integer pairs that sum to 24 might provide insight or verify the final answer.\n\nI think starting with the **Substitution Method** makes sense because it\u2019s straightforward. If that doesn't work, I'll consider the Elimination Method or simplifying the second equation further.\n\n### **Step 1: Solve for One Variable**\n\nLet's start with the **Substitution Method**.\n\nGiven:\n\\[ a + b = 24 \\]\n\nI can express \\(b\\) in terms of \\(a\\):\n\\[ b = 24 - a \\]\n\n**Reflection**: This seems a good beginning because substituting \\(b\\) in the second equation might simplify it.\n\n### **Step 2: Substitute \\(b\\) into the Second Equation**\n\nNow, substitute \\(b = 24 - a\\) into the second equation:\n\\[ 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \\]\n\nPlugging in \\(b\\):\n\\[ 2a(24 - a) + 10a = 3(24 - a) + 222 \\]\n\n**Simplify the Left Side**:\n\\[ 2a(24 - a) + 10a = 48a - 2a^2 + 10a = 58a - 2a^2 \\]\n\n**Simplify the Right Side**:\n\\[ 3(24 - a) + 222 = 72 - 3a + 222 = 294 - 3a \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ 58a - 2a^2 = 294 - 3a \\]\n\n**Reflection**: At this point, it looks like a quadratic equation. I thought maybe rearranging it would help set it up for solving.\n\n### **Step 3: Rearrange the Equation**\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\\[ 58a - 2a^2 - 294 + 3a = 0 \\]\n\\[ 61a - 2a^2 - 294 = 0 \\]\n\n**Reflection**: Rearranging makes it look like a standard quadratic equation, which can be solved using factoring, the quadratic formula, or another method. Given the coefficients, factoring might be tricky, so I'm leaning towards the quadratic formula.\n\n### **Step 4: Apply the Quadratic Formula**\n\nThe standard form of a quadratic equation is:\n\\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\]\n\nOur equation is:\n\\[ -2a^2 + 61a - 294 = 0 \\]\n\nMultiplying through by \\(-1\\) to make \\(a^2\\) positive:\n\\[ 2a^2 - 61a + 294 = 0 \\]\n\n**Quadratic Formula**:\n\\[ a = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\nWhere:\n- \\(a = 2\\)\n- \\(b = -61\\)\n- \\(c = 294\\)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[ a = \\frac{61 \\pm \\sqrt{(-61)^2 - 4 \\times 2 \\times 294}}{2 \\times 2} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{61 \\pm \\sqrt{3721 - 2352}}{4} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{61 \\pm \\sqrt{1369}}{4} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{61 \\pm 37}{4} \\]\n\n**Calculating Possible Values of \\(a\\)**:\n\\[ a = \\frac{98}{4} = 24.5 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad a = \\frac{24}{4} = 6 \\]\n\n**Reflection**: Wait, \\(a = 24.5\\) doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers. This suggests that either there's a miscalculation or that only \\(a = 6\\) is valid. Let's verify the calculations.\n\n### **Step 5: Double-Check Calculations**\n\n**Rechecking the Discriminant**:\n\\[ (-61)^2 = 3721 \\]\n\\[ 4 \\times 2 \\times 294 = 2352 \\]\n\\[ 3721 - 2352 = 1369 \\]\n\\[ \\sqrt{1369} = 37 \\]\n\n**Reflection**: The calculations seem correct. However, since \\(a = 24.5\\) isn't an integer, it raises a red flag. Let's explore if there's another approach to confirm the integer solution.\n\n### **Step 6: Alternative Approach\u2014Integer Constraints**\n\nGiven that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers, let's consider that perhaps the quadratic equation might not yield all possible solutions when considering integer constraints. Let's also verify if there's another pair that satisfies both equations.\n\n**Testing \\(a = 6\\)**:\nIf \\(a = 6\\), then:\n\\[ a + b = 24 \\implies b = 24 - 6 = 18 \\]\n\nNow, let's check if these values satisfy the second equation:\n\\[ 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \\]\n\\[ 2(6)(18) + 10(6) = 3(18) + 222 \\]\n\\[ 216 + 60 = 54 + 222 \\]\n\\[ 276 = 276 \\]\n\n**Reflection**: This works perfectly. Therefore, \\(a = 6\\) and \\(b = 18\\) satisfy both equations.\n\n### **Step 7: Calculate \\(ab\\)**\n\nNow that we have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\\[ ab = 6 \\times 18 = 108 \\]\n\n**Final Check**: Let\u2019s verify if \\(ab = 108\\) makes sense with both original equations.\n\n**Check with First Equation**:\n\\[ a + b = 24 \\implies 6 + 18 = 24 \\quad \\text{(True)} \\]\n\n**Check with Second Equation**:\n\\[ 2ab + 10a = 3b + 222 \\]\n\\[ 2(108) + 10(6) = 3(18) + 222 \\]\n\\[ 216 + 60 = 54 + 222 \\]\n\\[ 276 = 276 \\quad \\text{(True)} \\]\n\nEverything checks out, so the value of \\(ab\\) is indeed **108**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy starting with the substitution method and solving the resulting quadratic equation, we found \\(a = 6\\) and \\(b = 18\\). Verifying these values against both original equations confirmed their correctness. Thus, the value of \\(ab\\) is **108**.\n\nThroughout the process, I reflected on each step, checked calculations, and considered alternative strategies when the initial approach led to a non-integer solution. This ensured that the final answer was accurate and aligned with the problem's requirements.",

  "ground_truth": "We begin by rewriting the equation as $2ab + 10a - 3b = 222$. We can then use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation to get $2ab + 10a - 3b - 15 = 207$. This can be factored into $$(2a - 3)(b + 5) = 207$$We know that the prime factorization of $207 = 3^2 \\cdot 23$ and that both $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, so the only possible solutions $(a,b)$ are $$(a,b) = \\{(13,4),(6,18),(2,202),(3,64)\\}$$Out of these, only $(6,18)$ meets the requirement that $a+b=24$. Thus, $ab = \\boxed{108}$."
