    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step. I\u2019ll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it myself\u2014brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, checking for correctness, and being open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, the problem asks: **What is the remainder when \\(7^{2010}\\) is divided by \\(100\\)?**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Hmm, raising \\(7\\) to such a high power and then dividing by \\(100\\) to find the remainder sounds like a modular arithmetic problem. It reminds me of problems where we deal with congruences.\n  \n- **Memory Jog:** I remember there's something called **modular exponentiation** that's useful for calculating large powers modulo a number. Maybe Euler's Theorem or the Chinese Remainder Theorem could come into play here.\n\n- **Uncertainty:** But wait, I'm not entirely sure which method is best right now. I often start by exploring a few strategies to see which one works. \n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Possible Strategies**\n\n1. **Direct Computation Modulo 100:**\n   - Try calculating \\(7^{2010}\\) directly modulo \\(100\\).\n   - **Thought:** This seems impractical because \\(7^{2010}\\) is an enormous number. Direct computation would take too long and is likely not feasible without a computer.\n\n2. **Using Euler\u2019s Theorem:**\n   - Recall that Euler's Theorem states if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\\).\n   - **Reflection:** Since \\(7\\) and \\(100\\) are coprime, perhaps Euler's Theorem can simplify \\(7^{2010}\\).\n\n3. **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):**\n   - Break down the problem by finding \\(7^{2010} \\mod 4\\) and \\(7^{2010} \\mod 25\\), since \\(100 = 4 \\times 25\\).\n   - **Thinking:** This approach might simplify the calculations by handling smaller moduli separately.\n\n4. **Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem:**\n   - This is a special case of Euler's Theorem for prime moduli.\n   - **Consideration:** Could it be applicable here with composite moduli?\n\n- **Decision:** After considering these options, I think using **Euler\u2019s Theorem** in conjunction with **CRT** might be the most efficient method. Euler\u2019s Theorem can help reduce the exponent, and CRT will allow me to combine the results from different moduli.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying Euler\u2019s Theorem**\n\n**Goal:** Simplify \\(7^{2010} \\mod 100\\) using Euler's Theorem.\n\n- **Recall Euler\u2019s Theorem:** Since \\(7\\) and \\(100\\) are coprime (\\(\\gcd(7, 100) = 1\\)),\n  \n  \\[\n  7^{\\phi(100)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Calculate \\(\\phi(100)\\):**\n  - \\(100 = 2^2 \\times 5^2\\)\n  - \\[\n  \\phi(100) = 100 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 100 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 40\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** So, \\(7^{40} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}\\). This is useful because it tells me that exponents can be reduced modulo \\(40\\).\n\n- **Simplifying the Exponent:**\n  - \\[\n  2010 \\mod 40\n  \\]\n  - **Calculation:**\n    - \\(2010 \\div 40 = 50\\) with a remainder of \\(10\\)\n    - So, \\(2010 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{40}\\)\n  \n- **Conclusion of Step 1:** \n  \\[\n  7^{2010} \\equiv 7^{10} \\pmod{100}\n  \\]\n  \n---\n\n### **Step 2: Computing \\(7^{10} \\mod 100\\)**\n\n**Goal:** Now, I need to compute \\(7^{10} \\mod 100\\).\n\n- **Approach:** Since \\(10\\) is not too large, I can compute \\(7^{10}\\) directly using successive squaring to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n- **Calculations:**\n  \n  1. **Compute \\(7^2 \\mod 100\\):**\n     \\[\n     7^2 = 49\n     \\]\n     \n  2. **Compute \\(7^4 \\mod 100\\):**\n     \\[\n     7^4 = (7^2)^2 = 49^2 = 2401\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2401 \\mod 100 = 1 \\quad (\\text{since } 2401 = 24 \\times 100 + 1)\n     \\]\n     \n  3. **Compute \\(7^8 \\mod 100\\):**\n     \\[\n     7^8 = (7^4)^2 = 1^2 = 1\n     \\]\n     \n  4. **Compute \\(7^{10} \\mod 100\\):**\n     \\[\n     7^{10} = 7^8 \\times 7^2 = 1 \\times 49 = 49\n     \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:** Wait a minute, let me double-check that. If \\(7^4 \\mod 100 = 1\\), then higher powers like \\(7^8\\) would also be \\(1\\). Multiplying by \\(7^2 = 49\\) gives \\(49\\). That seems correct.\n\n- **Conclusion of Step 2:**\n  \\[\n  7^{2010} \\equiv 49 \\pmod{100}\n  \\]\n  \n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verification Focusing on Computing \\(7^{10} \\mod 4\\) and \\(7^{10} \\mod 25\\)**\n\n**Goal:** To ensure correctness, let's verify by breaking down \\(7^{2010} \\mod 100\\) into \\(7^{2010} \\mod 4\\) and \\(7^{2010} \\mod 25\\) using the **Chinese Remainder Theorem** (CRT).\n\n- **Reflection:** Wait, earlier I simplified \\(7^{2010}\\) to \\(7^{10} \\mod 100\\), but maybe verifying it through CRT could provide additional confidence.\n\n- **Approach:**\n  - Compute \\(7^{2010} \\mod 4\\)\n  - Compute \\(7^{2010} \\mod 25\\)\n  - Ensure that these results align with \\(7^{10} \\mod 100\\)\n\n- **Calculations:**\n  \n  1. **Compute \\(7^{2010} \\mod 4\\):**\n     - \\(7 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}\\)\n     - So, \\(7^{2010} \\equiv 3^{2010} \\pmod{4}\\)\n     - **Observation:** Any power of \\(3\\) modulo \\(4\\) is \\(1\\) because \\(3^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}\\)\n     - **Conclusion:**\n       \\[\n       3^{2010} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}\n       \\]\n     \n  2. **Compute \\(7^{2010} \\mod 25\\):**\n     - **Thought:** Since \\(25\\) is a multiple of \\(5\\), and \\(7\\) is not divisible by \\(5\\), Euler's Theorem applies.\n     - Compute \\(\\phi(25)\\):\n       \\[\n       25 = 5^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\phi(25) = 25 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 25 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 20\n       \\]\n     - According to Euler\u2019s Theorem:\n       \\[\n       7^{20} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}\n       \\]\n     - Reduce the exponent:\n       \\[\n       2010 \\mod 20 = 10\n       \\]\n     - So:\n       \\[\n       7^{2010} \\equiv 7^{10} \\pmod{25}\n       \\]\n     - **Calculating \\(7^{10} \\mod 25\\):**\n       - Compute powers of \\(7\\) modulo \\(25\\):\n         1. \\(7^2 = 49 \\mod 25 = 24\\)\n         2. \\(7^4 = 24^2 = 576 \\mod 25 = 1\\)\n         3. \\(7^8 = 1^2 = 1\\)\n         4. \\(7^{10} = 7^8 \\times 7^2 = 1 \\times 24 = 24 \\mod 25\\)\n       - **Conclusion:**\n         \\[\n         7^{2010} \\equiv 24 \\pmod{25}\n         \\]\n     \n- **Combining Results Using CRT:**\n  - We have:\n    \\[\n    7^{2010} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 7^{2010} \\equiv 24 \\pmod{25}\n    \\]\n  - **Reflection:** Hmm, let's see if these align with the earlier result \\(7^{2010} \\equiv 49 \\pmod{100}\\).\n  - **Checking Compatibility:**\n    - \\(49 \\mod 4 = 49 \\div 4 = 12\\) with a remainder of \\(1\\)\n    - \\(49 \\mod 25 = 49 - 25 = 24\\)\n    - So, \\(49 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}\\) and \\(49 \\equiv 24 \\pmod{25}\\), which match our CRT results.\n  \n- **Conclusion of Step 3:** This verification aligns with our earlier calculation, confirming that \\(7^{2010} \\equiv 49 \\pmod{100}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Consistency Check:** Both methods\u2014direct exponent reduction using Euler\u2019s Theorem and breaking down via CRT\u2014yield the same result: \\(49\\).\n  \n- **Confidence in Answer:** Since both approaches agree and the calculations have been verified step by step, I\u2019m confident that the remainder when \\(7^{2010}\\) is divided by \\(100\\) is indeed **49**.\n\n- **Final Answer:**\n  \\[\n  \\boxed{49}\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Thought Process Throughout**\n\n- **Exploring Strategies:** Initially, I considered direct computation, Euler\u2019s Theorem, CRT, and Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem. Direct computation seemed impractical, so I leaned towards Euler\u2019s Theorem and CRT.\n\n- **Checking Work:** After each major step, I reflected and verified the calculations, ensuring that the results were consistent.\n\n- **Adapting Approach:** When verifying through CRT, I realized the importance of breaking down the problem into smaller moduli, which reinforced the correctness of the initial method.\n\n- **Mistake and Correction:** Initially, I might have thought of calculating \\(7^{10}\\) directly, but recognizing the power reduction using Euler\u2019s Theorem was crucial to simplify the problem.\n\n- **Final Checks:** By verifying results under different moduli and ensuring consistency, I confirmed the accuracy of the solution.\n\nThis step-by-step method, with constant reflection and verification, ensured that the problem was tackled effectively and correctly.",

  "ground_truth": "We begin by computing the remainder of some small powers of $7$. As $7^0 = 1, 7^1 = 7,$ and $7^2 = 49$, then $7^3 = 49 \\cdot 7 = 343$ leaves a remainder of $43$ after division by $100$, and $7^4$ leaves the remainder that $43 \\cdot 7 = 301$ does after division by $100$, namely $1$. The sequence of powers thus repeat modulo $100$ again. In particular, the remainder that the powers of $7$ leave after division by $100$ is periodic with period $4$. Then, $7^{2010} = 7^{4 \\cdot 502 + 2}$ leaves the same remainder as $7^2$ does after division by $100$, which is $\\boxed{49}$."
