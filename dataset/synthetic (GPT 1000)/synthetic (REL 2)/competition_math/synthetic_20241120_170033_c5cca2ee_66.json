    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem and approach it step by step, just like how I would naturally think through it if I were tackling it on paper or in my mind. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, check if I'm on the right track, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, a few things come to mind:\n\n- **Fractions and Whole Numbers:** It involves fractions of a total number and specific counts of certain colors. This reminds me of problems where you set up equations based on parts of a whole.\n\n- **Total Number Calculation:** Since fractions are given, I might need to find the total number of bows to determine how many are green.\n\n- **Equation Setup:** Perhaps setting up an equation where the sum of all fractional parts equals 1 (or 100% of the total) could work.\n\nBut then I think, **\"Wait, I need the total number of bows to find the exact count of green ones. So getting that right is crucial.\"**\n\nLet me brainstorm different strategies:\n\n1. **Method 1:** Set up an equation where the sum of the fractional parts equals the total number. This seems straightforward.\n   \n2. **Method 2:** Use the given number of white bows to backtrack and find the total.\n\n3. **Method 3:** Since fractions are involved, maybe converting them to percentages could help, but it's already given in fractions which are easier to work with here.\n\nI'm leaning towards **Method 1** because it directly ties the fractions to the total, but I'll keep Method 2 in mind as a cross-check. \n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Equation**\n\nI'll start with **Method 1.** According to the problem:\n\n- \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) are red\n- \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) are blue\n- \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) are green\n- The remaining 30 are white\n\nSo, the sum of all these fractions plus the white bows should equal the total number of bows (\\(N\\)):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5}N + \\frac{1}{2}N + \\frac{1}{10}N + 30 = N\n\\]\n\nLet me think about this. **\"Does this equation make sense? It should because the left side represents all the bows in terms of \\(N\\), and the right side is \\(N\\) itself.\"** But just to be sure, I'll proceed and see if the numbers add up logically later.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Equation**\n\nNow, I need to simplify the equation to solve for \\(N\\). First, let's combine the fractional parts:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5}N + \\frac{1}{2}N + \\frac{1}{10}N = N - 30\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, I need to make sure the fractional parts add up correctly. Let\u2019s find a common denominator. The denominators are 5, 2, and 10. The **least common multiple (LCM)** is 10.\n\nSo, let's convert each fraction:\n\n- \\(\\frac{1}{5}N = \\frac{2}{10}N\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{2}N = \\frac{5}{10}N\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{10}N = \\frac{1}{10}N\\)\n\nNow let's add them up:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{10}N + \\frac{5}{10}N + \\frac{1}{10}N = \\frac{8}{10}N = \\frac{4}{5}N\n\\]\n\n**Thought Check:** **\"Is \\(\\frac{4}{5}N\\) reasonable? Yes, it accounts for most of the total, leaving room for the white bows.\"**\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{5}N + 30 = N\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\(N\\)**\n\nNext, I'll solve for \\(N\\). To isolate \\(N\\), subtract \\(\\frac{4}{5}N\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n30 = N - \\frac{4}{5}N\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n30 = \\frac{1}{5}N\n\\]\n\nHmm, let me double-check this. **\"Wait, that seems logical because if \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) of \\(N\\) leaves 30, then \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of \\(N\\) must be 30.\"** \n\nTo find \\(N\\), multiply both sides by 5:\n\n\\[\nN = 30 \\times 5 = 150\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** **\"Does 150 total bows make sense given the other information? Let's check.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**\n\nLet\u2019s plug \\(N = 150\\) back into the equation to see if it satisfies all conditions.\n\nCalculate each color's count:\n\n- **Red:** \\(\\frac{1}{5} \\times 150 = 30\\)\n- **Blue:** \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 150 = 75\\)\n- **Green:** \\(\\frac{1}{10} \\times 150 = 15\\)\n- **White:** Given as 30\n\nNow, let\u2019s add them up:\n\n\\[\n30 \\,(\\text{Red}) + 75 \\,(\\text{Blue}) + 15 \\,(\\text{Green}) + 30 \\,(\\text{White}) = 150\n\\]\n\n**Thought Check:** **\"The numbers add up to 150, which is the total. This confirms that our calculation is correct.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Number of Green Bows**\n\nNow that we have \\(N = 150\\), let's find the number of green bows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10} \\times 150 = 15\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:** **\"So, there are 15 green bows. It all checks out - the fractions add up to the total, and each individual calculation aligns with the given information.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Using the White Bows to Validate**\n\nJust to ensure everything is accurate, let me consider **Method 2**, where we use the information about the white bows.\n\nWe know that the remaining bows after accounting for red, blue, and green are white:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total bows} - (\\text{Red} + \\text{Blue} + \\text{Green}) = 30\n\\]\n\nSo, using \\(N = 150\\):\n\n\\[\n150 - (30 + 75 + 15) = 150 - 120 = 30\n\\]\n\n**Thought Check:** **\"This matches the given number of white bows, confirming that our total \\(N\\) is correct.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying each step, the number of green bows in the jumbo bag is **15**. \n\nBy setting up an equation based on the fractional parts and the given number of white bows, I was able to solve for the total number of bows and subsequently determine the count of green bows. Throughout the process, checking and reflecting on each step ensured the accuracy of the solution.",

So the 30 bows make up $1-\\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{1}{5}$ of the total bows, and the total number of bows is $5\\times30=150$. The green bows are $\\frac{1}{10}$ of the total, and $\\frac{1}{10}\\times150=15$, so there are $\\boxed{15}$ green bows."
