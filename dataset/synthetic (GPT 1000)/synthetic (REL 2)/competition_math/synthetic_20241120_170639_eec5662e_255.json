I'll take you through my brainstorming process, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step to ensure correctness, and adjusting my approach as needed\u2014just like how a human would tackle a mathematical problem. \n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so the problem is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{49 - x^2} - \\sqrt{25 - x^2} = 3\n\\]\n\nand we need to find:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{49 - x^2} + \\sqrt{25 - x^2}\n\\]\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Difference of Squares:** Immediately, the expression \\(\\sqrt{49 - x^2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{25 - x^2}\\) remind me of the difference of squares formula\u2014maybe something related to that could help.\n\n- **Adding and Subtracting Equations:** Perhaps if I can find a way to relate the given equation to the one we need to solve, using addition or subtraction might work.\n\n- **Squaring Both Sides:** This is a common technique to eliminate square roots, but I need to be careful about extraneous solutions.\n\n- **Substitution:** Maybe introducing a new variable to simplify the square roots could make things clearer.\n\nHonestly, at this point, I'm leaning towards using the **difference of squares** approach because it seems the most straightforward, but I'm also considering squaring both sides as a backup plan. \n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Exploring the Difference of Squares Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI remember that the difference of two square roots can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} = \\frac{a - b}{\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b}}\n\\]\n\nThis reminds me of the given equation. If I can express the left side in this form, maybe I can relate it to the right side.\n\n**Applying the Formula:**\n\nLet me set:\n\n\\[\na = 49 - x^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = 25 - x^2\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{49 - x^2} - \\sqrt{25 - x^2} = \\frac{(49 - x^2) - (25 - x^2)}{\\sqrt{49 - x^2} + \\sqrt{25 - x^2}} = \\frac{49 - 25}{\\sqrt{49 - x^2} + \\sqrt{25 - x^2}} = \\frac{24}{\\sqrt{49 - x^2} + \\sqrt{25 - x^2}}\n\\]\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{\\sqrt{49 - x^2} + \\sqrt{25 - x^2}} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(\\sqrt{49 - x^2} + \\sqrt{25 - x^2}\\):**\n\nLet's call:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sqrt{49 - x^2} + \\sqrt{25 - x^2}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{24}{S} = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad S = \\frac{24}{3} = 8\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, that was pretty quick. Let me double-check if this makes sense. \n\nAccording to this method, \\(\\sqrt{49 - x^2} + \\sqrt{25 - x^2} = 8\\). But I should verify if this approach is correct or if I missed something.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Verifying the Difference of Squares Approach**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nIf \\(\\sqrt{49 - x^2} + \\sqrt{25 - x^2} = 8\\), then let's see if this satisfies the original equation.\n\nBut before that, I should ensure that the **difference** of the square roots indeed equals 3, as given.\n\n**Calculating \\(\\sqrt{49 - x^2} - \\sqrt{25 - x^2}\\):**\n\nLet's express the difference in terms of \\(S\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{49 - x^2} - \\sqrt{25 - x^2} = (\\sqrt{49 - x^2} + \\sqrt{25 - x^2}) - 2\\sqrt{25 - x^2} = S - 2\\sqrt{25 - x^2}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(S = 8\\), so:\n\n\\[\n8 - 2\\sqrt{25 - x^2} = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2\\sqrt{25 - x^2} = 8 - 3 = 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\sqrt{25 - x^2} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n\\]\n\n**Checking \\(b = 25 - x^2\\):**\n\nIf \\(\\sqrt{25 - x^2} = 2.5\\), then:\n\n\\[\n25 - x^2 = (2.5)^2 = 6.25 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x^2 = 25 - 6.25 = 18.75\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\(a = 49 - x^2\\):**\n\n\\[\n49 - x^2 = 49 - 18.75 = 30.25\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\(S\\):**\n\n\\[\nS = \\sqrt{30.25} + \\sqrt{6.25} = 5.5 + 2.5 = 8\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe quick check aligns perfectly. So, the difference of squares method seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{49 - x^2} + \\sqrt{25 - x^2} = 8\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Exploring an Alternative Method\u2014Squaring Both Sides**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nEven though the difference of squares method worked, let's see if squaring both sides would lead to the same solution. This way, I can confirm the correctness of the initial approach.\n\n**Starting with the Original Equation:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{49 - x^2} - \\sqrt{25 - x^2} = 3\n\\]\n\n**Squaring Both Sides:**\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{49 - x^2} - \\sqrt{25 - x^2})^2 = 3^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad (49 - x^2) - 2\\sqrt{(49 - x^2)(25 - x^2)} + (25 - x^2) = 9\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**\n\n\\[\n74 - 2x^2 - 2\\sqrt{(49 - x^2)(25 - x^2)} = 9\n\\]\n\n\\[\n65 - 2x^2 = 2\\sqrt{(49 - x^2)(25 - x^2)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{65 - 2x^2}{2} = \\sqrt{(49 - x^2)(25 - x^2)}\n\\]\n\nWait a second. This looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides isn't the best approach here, especially since we already have a straightforward solution from the first method.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSquaring introduced more complexity, making it harder to isolate \\(x\\). Given that the difference of squares method provided a direct answer, it's probably best to stick with that.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\nAfter exploring both methods, the **difference of squares** approach not only yielded a quick and straightforward solution but also passed the verification check. On the other hand, attempting to square both sides added unnecessary complexity and didn't lead directly to the answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{49 - x^2} + \\sqrt{25 - x^2} = 8\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the correctness of the solution, I've confidently arrived at the answer. It's essential to explore various methods but also to recognize when a particular approach isn't working and adjust accordingly. This reflective and flexible thinking ensures accuracy in problem-solving.",

  "ground_truth": "Adding $\\sqrt{25-x^2}$ to both sides gives \\[\\sqrt{49-x^2} = 3 + \\sqrt{25-x^2}.\\]Then, squaring both sides, we get \\[49-x^2 = 9 + 6\\sqrt{25-x^2} + (25-x^2),\\]so \\[15 = 6\\sqrt{25-x^2}.\\]Thus, $\\sqrt{25-x^2} = \\frac{15}{6} = \\frac{5}{2}.$ Instead of solving for $x$ from here, we notice that \\[\\sqrt{49-x^2} = 3 + \\sqrt{25-x^2} = 3 + \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{11}{2}.\\]Thus, \\[\\sqrt{49-x^2} + \\sqrt{25-x^2} = \\frac{11}{2} + \\frac{5}{2} = \\boxed{8}.\\]"
