    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step step, exploring different strategies, reflecting often, and making sure to check our work along the way. I'll make my thought process as human-like as possible, complete with brainstorming, dead ends, and those \"aha\" moments.\n\n---\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, so we have a line given by the equation \\( y = \\frac{3}{2}x - 25 \\). There's also a parameterization provided: \\( (x,y) = (f(t), 15t - 7) \\). The goal is to find the function \\( f(t) \\).\n\nHonestly, when I first see it, it looks like we're dealing with parameterization of a line, which reminds me of problems where we need to match two different representations of the same line. It feels like integrating a linear function with a parameterized vector equation.\n\nBut right off the bat\u2014 **I'm not entirely clear how the parameter \\( t \\) fits into the original line equation.** Typically, in parameterizations, \\( t \\) represents a variable that traces out the line as it changes, but here, both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) depend on \\( t \\). \n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Substitute the Parameterization into the Line Equation:**  \n   Maybe substituting \\( y = 15t - 7 \\) into the line equation could help find \\( f(t) \\).\n\n2. **Express \\( x \\) in Terms of \\( t \\):**  \n   Alternatively, perhaps expressing \\( x \\) as a function of \\( t \\) and then matching it to \\( f(t) \\) is the way to go.\n\n3. **Check for Consistency:**  \n   I could also check if the parameterization satisfies the line equation, ensuring everything aligns.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nI think starting with substitution makes sense because if \\( (x, y) \\) lies on the line for all \\( t \\), substituting \\( y \\) should give a direct relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( t \\).\n\n---\n### **Step 1: Substitute \\( y \\) into the Line Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s take the line equation \\( y = \\frac{3}{2}x - 25 \\) and substitute \\( y = 15t - 7 \\) from the parameterization. This should help us find \\( x \\) in terms of \\( t \\), which is what \\( f(t) \\) is supposed to be.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubstitute \\( y \\) into the line equation:\n\n\\[\n15t - 7 = \\frac{3}{2}x - 25\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n**Wait, I need to solve for \\( x \\) to find \\( f(t) \\).** I should isolate \\( x \\) on one side.\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nTo isolate \\( x \\), I can add 25 to both sides and then multiply by \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. Add 25 to both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   15t - 7 + 25 = \\frac{3}{2}x\n   \\]\n\n   Simplify:\n\n   \\[\n   15t + 18 = \\frac{3}{2}x\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply both sides by \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{2}{3} (15t + 18)\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   x = 10t + 12\n   \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nIs \\( f(t) = 10t + 12 \\)? It feels right because \\( x = f(t) \\), and the arithmetic checks out.\n\n**Realization:**  \n**Oh, this matches the standard form for a linear parameterization.** It makes sense that \\( x \\) is expressed in terms of \\( t \\) like this. But let me **double-check** by seeing if both parameterized equations satisfy the original line equation.\n\n---\n### **Step 2: Verify by Substituting Back**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo ensure correctness, I'll substitute \\( x = 10t + 12 \\) and \\( y = 15t - 7 \\) back into the original line equation \\( y = \\frac{3}{2}x - 25 \\). If both sides equal, our function \\( f(t) \\) is correct.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1. Substitute \\( x \\) into the line equation:\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{3}{2}(10t + 12) - 25\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   y = 15t + 18 - 25\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   y = 15t - 7\n   \\]\n\n2. Compare with the parameterized \\( y \\):\n\n   \\[\n   y = 15t - 7\n   \\]\n\n**Check:**  \n**Both sides are equal!** So, our function \\( f(t) = 10t + 12 \\) is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n**This confirms that the parameterization is consistent with the original line equation.** The step-by-step substitution and verification ensure that \\( f(t) \\) accurately represents the \\( x \\)-coordinate along the line for any \\( t \\).\n\n---\n### **Final Thoughts and Conclusion**\n\n**Summary of Steps:**\n\n1. **Substituted** the parameterized \\( y \\) into the original line equation to express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( t \\).\n2. **Solved** for \\( x \\), resulting in \\( f(t) = 10t + 12 \\).\n3. **Verified** that both parameterized equations satisfy the original line equation, confirming the correctness of \\( f(t) \\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \n**At first, I wasn't sure how to connect the parameterization to the line equation.** By brainstorming different strategies and choosing substitution, I was able to derive \\( f(t) \\) successfully. **Checking the work ensured the solution's validity, preventing any errors from going unnoticed.**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nf(t) = 10t + 12\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with continuous reflection and verification, led to the correct function \\( f(t) \\), ensuring a thorough and human-like problem-solving process.",
