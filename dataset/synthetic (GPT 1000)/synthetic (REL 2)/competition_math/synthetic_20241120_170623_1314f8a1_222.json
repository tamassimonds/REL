    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, just like I would naturally when tackling a math question. I'll start by brainstorming how to approach it, reflecting on each step, checking my work, and adjusting my strategy as needed. Let's begin!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem, it reminds me of arithmetic sequences, which I recall from previous math topics. Here's what stands out to me:\n\n- **Arithmetic Sequence**: I remember that in an arithmetic sequence, each term is generated by adding a constant difference to the previous term.\n- **Given Terms**: We're provided with the first term and the thirteenth term.\n- **Task**: Find the fiftieth term.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n\n- **Formula Approach**: I think there\u2019s a general formula for the nth term in an arithmetic sequence. Maybe I could use that.\n- **Finding the Common Difference**: Perhaps I need to determine the common difference between terms first.\n- **Check if More Info is Needed**: I'm uncertain if I need the second term or additional information to find the fiftieth term.\n\n**Hmm... Wait**: I don\u2019t recall ever needing the second term directly if I have the first and a later term. That gives me confidence that the formula approach might work here.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n1. **Use the Arithmetic Sequence Formula**:\n   - I remember that the nth term can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \\times d\n     \\]\n     where:\n     - \\( a_n \\) is the nth term,\n     - \\( a_1 \\) is the first term,\n     - \\( n \\) is the term number,\n     - \\( d \\) is the common difference.\n\n2. **Find the Common Difference (\\( d \\))**:\n   - I can use the information from the first term and the thirteenth term to find \\( d \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Fiftieth Term**:\n   - Once I have \\( d \\), I can substitute it back into the formula to find the fiftieth term.\n\n**Let\u2019s Start with Strategy 1**: Using the formula to find \\( d \\) and then calculating \\( a_{50} \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Using the Given Information to Find \\( d \\)**\n\n**Given:**\n- First term (\\( a_1 \\)) = 5\n- Thirteenth term (\\( a_{13} \\)) = 29\n\n**Applying the Formula**:\n\\[\na_{13} = a_1 + (13 - 1) \\times d\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n29 = 5 + 12d\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( d \\)**:\n\\[\n29 - 5 = 12d \\implies 24 = 12d \\implies d = \\frac{24}{12} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**:\n\nOkay, so the common difference \\( d \\) is 2. That seems reasonable. Each term increases by 2 from the previous one.\n\n**Quick Check**: \n- **Does it make sense?**: Yes, if I add 2 repeatedly starting from 5, I should reach 29 at the thirteenth term. Let me verify:\n\n  \\[\n  5 + (12 \\times 2) = 5 + 24 = 29\n  \\]\n  \n  **Looks correct!**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculating the Fiftieth Term (\\( a_{50} \\))**\n\n**Using the Arithmetic Sequence Formula Again**:\n\\[\na_{50} = a_1 + (50 - 1) \\times d\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\na_{50} = 5 + 49 \\times 2\n\\]\nCalculating:\n\\[\na_{50} = 5 + 98 = 103\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**:\n\nSo, the fiftieth term is 103. Let me think about this for a moment.\n\n**Does This Result Make Sense?**\n- **Pattern Check**: If I look back at the sequence starting from 5 with a difference of 2:\n  \n  \\[\n  5, 7, 9, 11, \\ldots\n  \\]\n  \n  Adding 2 each time. By the fiftieth term, it should indeed be 103.\n\n- **Alternate Verification**: To double-check:\n  \n  \\[\n  a_{50} = a_{13} + (50 - 13) \\times d = 29 + 37 \\times 2 = 29 + 74 = 103\n  \\]\n  \n  This confirms the result.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nI feel confident that the fiftieth term is **103**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Strategy Worked Well**: Using the arithmetic sequence formula to find \\( d \\) and then calculating \\( a_{50} \\) was effective.\n- **Checking Was Vital**: Verifying each step ensured the correctness of the process and the final answer.\n- **No Need for Additional Information**: The problem was solvable with just the first and thirteenth terms, confirming that the formula approach was appropriate.\n\n**Final Answer**: The fiftieth term of the arithmetic sequence is **103**.\n\n---\n\nOverall, by brainstorming different strategies, applying the arithmetic sequence formula, and continuously checking my work, I arrived at the correct solution. This step-by-step approach, with reflections and adjustments along the way, ensured accuracy in finding the fiftieth term.",
