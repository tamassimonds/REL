I'll brainstorm, explore different strategies, reflect, check my work often, and adjust my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the problem **Simplify \\((r^2 + 3r - 2) - (r^2 + 7r - 5)\\)**, I think:\n\n- **Subtracting Expressions:** This looks like subtracting two quadratic expressions. I\u2019ve done similar problems before, so maybe I can apply the same strategies.\n- **Like Terms:** I remember that combining like terms is crucial when simplifying polynomials. But I should be careful with the negative sign when subtracting.\n- **Distributing Negative:** Perhaps I need to distribute the negative sign across the second expression to combine like terms properly.\n\nBut, honestly, I'm a bit unsure about the best way to start. Should I distribute first or combine like terms directly?\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Distribute the Negative Sign First:**  \n   - Maybe distributing the negative across the second expression would make it easier to combine like terms.\n\n2. **Combine Like Terms Directly:**  \n   - Alternatively, I could try combining like terms from both expressions without distributing first.\n\n3. **Simplify Each Expression Separately Before Subtracting:**  \n   - Simplifying each expression individually before subtracting might help clear things up.\n\n**Let\u2019s start with the first strategy**\u2014distributing the negative sign across the second expression. If that feels messy or doesn't work, I'll reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Distributing the Negative Sign**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI\u2019ll distribute the negative sign across \\((r^2 + 7r - 5)\\). This means changing the signs of each term inside the parentheses.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n(r^2 + 3r - 2) - (r^2 + 7r - 5) = r^2 + 3r - 2 - r^2 - 7r + 5\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOkay, that seems straightforward. Now, I have all the terms laid out to combine. But let me double-check: when distributing the negative, I changed \\(+7r\\) to \\(-7r\\) and \\(-5\\) to \\(+5\\). That looks correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Combining Like Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I\u2019ll group and combine the like terms\u2014terms with \\(r^2\\), \\(r\\), and constant terms separately.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n(r^2 - r^2) + (3r - 7r) + (-2 + 5)\n\\]\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- \\(r^2 - r^2 = 0r^2\\)\n- \\(3r - 7r = -4r\\)\n- \\(-2 + 5 = 3\\)\n\nSo, combining them gives:\n\n\\[\n0r^2 - 4r + 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute\u2014**0r^2**? That means the \\(r^2\\) terms cancel each other out completely. Initially, I thought there might be a quadratic term left, but it\u2019s zero. Let me check the calculations again.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nYes, \\(r^2 - r^2 = 0\\). So, no \\(r^2\\) term remains. That makes sense. The remaining terms are linear and constant.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Writing the Simplified Expression**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nSince the \\(r^2\\) term cancels out, I\u2019ll just write the remaining terms. It should be straightforward now.\n\n**Final Simplified Expression:**\n\n\\[\n-4r + 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nHmm, that seems too simple. But wait, simplifying often leads to clean answers. I think it\u2019s correct since all like terms are accounted for. Let me run through the steps one more time to ensure everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet me retrace my steps:\n\n1. **Distributed Negative Sign:**  \n   - Correctly changed \\(+7r\\) to \\(-7r\\) and \\(-5\\) to \\(+5\\).\n\n2. **Combined Like Terms:**  \n   - \\(r^2 - r^2 = 0r^2\\) \u21d2 Cancels out.\n   - \\(3r - 7r = -4r\\)\n   - \\(-2 + 5 = 3\\)\n\n3. **Final Expression:**  \n   - No \\(r^2\\) term, so just \\(-4r + 3\\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEverything checks out. The simplified expression is indeed **\\(-4r + 3\\)**. \n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Approach: Combining Like Terms Directly**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet me see if combining like terms directly without distributing the negative might work better.\n\n**Original Expression:**\n\n\\[\n(r^2 + 3r - 2) - (r^2 + 7r - 5)\n\\]\n\n**Attempt:**\n\n\\[\n[(r^2 + 3r - 2) - (r^2 + 7r - 5)] = r^2 + 3r - 2 - r^2 - 7r + 5\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying Directly:**\n\n\\[\nr^2 - r^2 + 3r - 7r - 2 + 5 = 0r^2 - 4r + 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis alternative approach led me to the same result: **\\(-4r + 3\\)**. So, distributing the negative sign or combining like terms directly both work. It's good to know that different strategies can arrive at the same solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n- **Checking Work:** Always a good idea to double-check each step, especially when dealing with negatives. It ensures accuracy.\n- **Exploring Strategies:** Starting with one method and being open to trying others helped confirm the solution.\n- **Simplification Skills:** Understanding how to combine like terms efficiently is key in polynomial simplifications.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{-4r + 3}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach, including brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting, and verifying, led us to the correct and simplified expression.",
