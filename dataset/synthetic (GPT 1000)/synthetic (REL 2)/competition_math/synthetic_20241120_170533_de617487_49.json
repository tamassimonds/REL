    "working_out": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were working through it on paper. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work frequently, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like multiplying two polynomials, similar to the distributive property or using the FOIL method for binomials. But wait, both expressions are trinomials (like three terms each), not just binomials. Hmm, that changes things a bit.\n  \n- **Recalling Strategies:** I remember that multiplying polynomials can be done through distribution, also known as the distributive property. Another method is organizing terms by degree to make the process clearer. Maybe I could also use the grid method, which is helpful for keeping track of all the products.\n\n- **Considering Time and Complexity:** The grid method might take longer but could help in visually organizing the multiplication. On the other hand, direct distribution (like the FOIL method but extended) seems straightforward but might get messy. I think starting with direct distribution would be a good approach and see how it goes.\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Should I arrange the terms by degree first? Maybe write them in descending order to make tracking easier? Or just start multiplying each term as they appear? Let me try starting without rearranging to see if it's manageable.\n\n### **Step 1: Writing Down the Problem**\n\nOkay, let's write down the problem clearly to avoid any confusion:\n\n\\[\n(2x^3 - 5y^2)(4x^6 + 10x^3y^2 + 25y^4)\n\\]\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Distributive Property**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI\u2019ll apply the distributive property, where each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. This reminds me of the FOIL method but extended to trinomials. It might get a bit messy, but let's start with this approach.\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies:**  \n- **Option 1:** Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second and then combine like terms.\n- **Option 2:** Use the grid method to organize the products better.\n  \nI\u2019ll go with Option 1 first to see how it goes. If it gets too tangled, I might switch to the grid method.\n\n**Starting with the First Term:**  \nLet\u2019s begin with \\(2x^3\\) from the first polynomial.\n\n1. **Multiply \\(2x^3\\) by Each Term in the Second Polynomial:**\n\n   - \\(2x^3 \\times 4x^6 = 8x^{9}\\)\n   - \\(2x^3 \\times 10x^3y^2 = 20x^{6}y^{2}\\)\n   - \\(2x^3 \\times 25y^4 = 50x^{3}y^{4}\\)\n\n   **Reflection:**  \n   Okay, those seem straightforward. I\u2019m just adding exponents where applicable, which makes sense. Let\u2019s move to the next term.\n\n**Next, the Second Term:**\n\n2. **Multiply \\(-5y^2\\) by Each Term in the Second Polynomial:**\n\n   - \\(-5y^2 \\times 4x^6 = -20x^{6}y^{2}\\)\n   - \\(-5y^2 \\times 10x^3y^2 = -50x^{3}y^{4}\\)\n   - \\(-5y^2 \\times 25y^4 = -125y^{6}\\)\n\n   **Checking Work:**  \n   Wait a second, does this match? Let me see...\n\n   - \\(-5y^2 \\times 4x^6\\) should be \\(-20x^6y^2\\) \u2014 correct because the exponents are added correctly.\n   - \\(-5y^2 \\times 10x^3y^2\\) becomes \\(-50x^3y^4\\) \u2014 also correct.\n   - \\(-5y^2 \\times 25y^4\\) is \\(-125y^6\\) \u2014 correct.\n\n   **Reflection:**  \n   Everything checks out. Now, I\u2019ll combine all these terms.\n\n### **Step 3: Combining Like Terms**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nI have all the individual products. Now, I need to combine them by adding or subtracting like terms. But first, let\u2019s list them neatly:\n\n\\[\n8x^{9} + 20x^{6}y^{2} + 50x^{3}y^{4} - 20x^{6}y^{2} - 50x^{3}y^{4} - 125y^{6}\n\\]\n\n**Combining Like Terms:**\n\n- **\\(8x^9\\):** There\u2019s only one term, so it remains \\(8x^9\\).\n  \n- **\\(20x^6y^2\\) and \\(-20x^6y^2\\):** These cancel each other out.\n  \n- **\\(50x^3y^4\\) and \\(-50x^3y^4\\):** These also cancel each other out.\n  \n- **\\(-125y^6\\):** There\u2019s only one term, so it remains \\(-125y^6\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWow, those middle terms canceled each other beautifully. That simplifies the expression a lot! Let\u2019s finalize the result.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n8x^{9} - 125y^{6}\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**  \nDoes this make sense?  \n- The exponents add up correctly in the multiplication steps.\n- The cancellation of like terms aligns perfectly.\n- There are no like terms left to combine, so the answer seems clean.\n\n**Final Thought:**  \nI think I approached this correctly. Starting with direct distribution worked well, and organizing the terms helped in identifying and canceling the like terms easily. If I had struggled more with keeping track, switching to the grid method might have been a good idea, but this method was smooth.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy applying the distributive property step by step and carefully combining like terms, I arrived at the final answer:  \n\\[\n8x^{9} - 125y^{6}\n\\]  \nKeeping the process organized and reflecting often helped in identifying and correcting any potential mistakes along the way.\n\n---\n\nThis walkthrough provided a detailed and human-like approach to solving the problem, incorporating brainstorming, strategy exploration, checking, and final reflection to ensure accuracy.",
