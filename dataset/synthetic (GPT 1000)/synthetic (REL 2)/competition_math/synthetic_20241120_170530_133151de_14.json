I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and ensuring each step is correct before moving on. Let's see where this journey takes us!\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nOkay, the question is asking for the **least common multiple (LCM)** of **8 and 15**. LCM is the smallest multiple that both numbers share. \n\nWhen I first see this, I think about:\n\n- **Multiples:** Maybe listing out the multiples of each number to find the smallest common one.\n- **Prime Factorization:** Breaking down each number into its prime factors and figuring out the LCM from there.\n- **Using the GCD:** I recall there's a relationship between LCM and GCD (greatest common divisor) that could be useful.\n\nBut honestly, I feel a bit unsure about which method might be the quickest or most straightforward. I think starting with listing multiples could be easy, but it might take time. Prime factorization seems more systematic. Let's brainstorm which method to try first.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n1. **Listing Multiples:**\n   - Pros: Simple and straightforward.\n   - Cons: Time-consuming, especially if numbers are large.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Pros: Systematic, leverages understanding of primes.\n   - Cons: Might require more initial steps, but generally efficient.\n\n3. **Using GCD:**\n   - Pros: Utilizes a known relationship; can be very efficient.\n   - Cons: Requires knowing how to find the GCD first.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nGiven that 8 and 15 aren't very large numbers, listing multiples might be feasible. However, I recall from math classes that prime factorization is a solid method, and since 8 is a power of 2, it should be straightforward. Using GCD is also efficient, but I want to ensure I remember the relationship correctly.\n\nI decide to **start with listing multiples** to see if it's straightforward. If it gets cumbersome, I'll switch to prime factorization.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Attempting the Multiples Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's start by listing the multiples of both numbers to find the smallest common one.\n\n**Listing Multiples:**\n\n- **Multiples of 8:**  \n  8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, ...\n\n- **Multiples of 15:**  \n  15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, ...\n\n**Checking for a Common Multiple:**\n\nLooking at both lists, I see the smallest common multiple is **120**.\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nWait a second. Let me scan both lists to ensure 120 is indeed the smallest common multiple. \n\n- **In the 8's list:** 120 divides evenly into multiples of 8 (120 \u00f7 8 = 15).\n- **In the 15's list:** 120 divides evenly into multiples of 15 (120 \u00f7 15 = 8).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, 120 does seem to be a common multiple. But let me think if there might be a smaller number I missed. Since I only listed a few multiples, maybe I overlooked something. However, glancing at the next smallest multiple in both lists, 240 (120 x 2), is much larger, so it's likely 120 is indeed the least.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe it's worth checking with another method to confirm.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Confirming with Prime Factorization**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTo cross-verify, let's use prime factorization, which should give us a more definitive answer.\n\n**Prime Factorization:**\n\n- **8:**  \n  - 8 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 2\u00b3\n\n- **15:**  \n  - 15 = 3 \u00d7 5\n\n**Finding LCM:**\n\nThe LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime present in the factorizations:\n\n- **Prime 2:** Highest power is 2\u00b3 from 8.\n- **Prime 3:** Present as 3\u00b9 from 15.\n- **Prime 5:** Present as 5\u00b9 from 15.\n\nSo, **LCM = 2\u00b3 \u00d7 3\u00b9 \u00d7 5\u00b9 = 8 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 120**.\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis confirms our earlier result.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nUsing prime factorization aligns with our multiple listing approach. It feels good to have a second method confirming the answer. This gives me confidence that 120 is indeed the least common multiple.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Confirmation Using GCD**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThere's another relationship I remember: **LCM \u00d7 GCD = Product of the two numbers**. Let's see if this holds true for 8 and 15.\n\n**Calculating GCD:**\n\nSince 8 and 15 have no common prime factors (8 is 2\u00b3, and 15 is 3\u00b9 \u00d7 5\u00b9), their GCD is **1**.\n\n**Using the Relationship:**\n\nLCM \u00d7 GCD = 8 \u00d7 15  \n120 \u00d7 1 = 120\n\n**Check:**\n\nThis matches the product of the two numbers, confirming that our LCM is correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIt's always good to check using multiple methods. The fact that all three approaches (multiples, prime factorization, and GCD relationship) lead to the same result reinforces the correctness of the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the result through multiple methods, I've confidently determined that the **least common multiple of 8 and 15 is 120**.\n\nThroughout the process, I started by brainstorming possible methods, attempted listing multiples, and reflected when I sensed a need for confirmation. By cross-verifying with prime factorization and the GCD relationship, I ensured that the answer was accurate.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**LCM of 8 and 15 is 120.**\n\n---\n\nThis approach mirrors natural human problem-solving, starting with brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting and recalibrating when necessary, and confirming the solution through multiple avenues to ensure accuracy.",
