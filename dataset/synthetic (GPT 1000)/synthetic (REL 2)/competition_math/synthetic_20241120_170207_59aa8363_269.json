    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem together, thinking through each step just like I would if I were solving it on paper. I\u2019ll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, check my work, and adjust my approach as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the problem, a few things stand out to me:\n\n1. **Two-Digit Number:** So, we're dealing with numbers between 10 and 99.\n   \n2. **Even and Multiple of 11:** This narrows down our options significantly. I remember that multiples of 11 in this range are 11, 22, 33, ... up to 99. Being even means we only consider 22, 44, 66, 88.\n\n3. **Product of Digits is a Perfect Cube:** This part makes me pause. I recall that perfect cubes are numbers like 1 (\\(1^3\\)), 8 (\\(2^3\\)), 27 (\\(3^3\\)), etc. So, the product of the digits needs to match one of these.\n\nMy initial reaction is to list all two-digit multiples of 11, check which are even, and then see if the product of their digits is a perfect cube. But I\u2019m also considering if there's a more efficient way to narrow it down.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Strategy 1: List All Two-Digit Multiples of 11**\n\n- **Thought:** This seems straightforward. I can list them, filter for even numbers, and then check the product of the digits.\n- **Potential Issue:** There are 90 two-digit numbers, so listing and checking might take time. But since we're only looking at multiples of 11, this number is manageable.\n\n**Strategy 2: Use Properties of Even Numbers and Multiples of 11**\n\n- **Thought:** Perhaps there's a pattern or property that can help me eliminate numbers without listing them all.\n- **Potential Issue:** I\u2019m not sure how to directly link being an even multiple of 11 with the digit product being a perfect cube.\n\n**Strategy 3: Direct Calculation for Each Candidate**\n\n- **Thought:** After narrowing down the candidates, I can directly calculate the product of the digits and see if it's a perfect cube.\n- **Potential Issue:** This might still involve checking multiple numbers unless the list is small.\n\n**Reflection:** Given that there are only a few two-digit multiples of 11, I think starting with Strategy 1 might be the most straightforward. If it becomes cumbersome, I can switch to Strategy 3 as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: List All Two-Digit Multiples of 11**\n\nLet's start by listing the two-digit multiples of 11:\n\n11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, that's nine numbers. Now, let's filter out the even ones.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identify Even Multiples of 11**\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- **Even Numbers:** 22, 44, 66, 88\n\n**Reflection:** Four candidates. This is manageable. Now, let's move on to checking the product of the digits.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Product of Digits**\n\nNow, I'll calculate the product of the digits for each of these numbers and see if it's a perfect cube.\n\n1. **22:**  \n   - Digits: 2, 2  \n   - Product: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)  \n   - **Check:** 4 is \\(2^2\\), not a perfect cube.\n\n2. **44:**  \n   - Digits: 4, 4  \n   - Product: \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\)  \n   - **Check:** 16 is \\(2^4\\), not a perfect cube.\n\n3. **66:**  \n   - Digits: 6, 6  \n   - Product: \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\)  \n   - **Check:** 36 is \\(6^2\\), not a perfect cube.\n\n4. **88:**  \n   - Digits: 8, 8  \n   - Product: \\(8 \\times 8 = 64\\)  \n   - **Check:** 64 is \\(4^3\\), which is a perfect cube.\n\n**Reflection:** Wait a minute, 88 seems to fit the criteria. The product of its digits is 64, which is a perfect cube (\\(4^3\\)). But let me double-check to ensure I haven't missed anything.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Double-Check the Conditions**\n\nBefore finalizing 88 as the answer, let's ensure all conditions are perfectly met:\n\n1. **Two-Digit Number:** 88 is between 10 and 99.\n   \n2. **Even Number:** 88 is even.\n\n3. **Multiple of 11:** \\(88 \u00f7 11 = 8\\), so it's a multiple of 11.\n\n4. **Product of Digits is a Perfect Cube:**  \n   - Digits: 8, 8  \n   - Product: \\(8 \\times 8 = 64\\)  \n   - 64 is indeed \\(4^3\\), a perfect cube.\n\n**Reflection:** Everything checks out. 88 meets all the criteria laid out in the problem.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Consider Alternative Strategies**\n\nJust to ensure that no other number meets the criteria, let's briefly revisit our strategies:\n\n- **Strategy 1 (Listing Multiples):** Already completed, and 88 is the only candidate where the digit product is a perfect cube.\n  \n- **Strategy 2 (Using Properties):** Perhaps I could think about the properties of perfect cubes and see if they align with even multiples of 11, but given the straightforward nature of the listing approach, this seems unnecessary.\n\n- **Strategy 3 (Direct Calculation):** This was essentially what I did, checking each candidate individually.\n\n**Reflection:** No alternative candidates emerged, and 88 satisfies all conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore concluding, let's do a final sanity check:\n\n- **Number Even?** \u2714\ufe0f Yes, 88 is even.\n- **Multiple of 11?** \u2714\ufe0f \\(88 \u00f7 11 = 8\\), so it's a multiple.\n- **Product of Digits a Perfect Cube?** \u2714\ufe0f \\(8 \\times 8 = 64\\), and 64 is \\(4^3\\).\n\n**Reflection:** All conditions are satisfied. The approach worked as intended, and the calculations are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter carefully listing the two-digit multiples of 11, filtering for even numbers, and checking the product of their digits, we find that **88** is the only two-digit number that meets all the given conditions:\n\n- It is even.\n- It is a multiple of 11.\n- The product of its digits (8 \u00d7 8 = 64) is a perfect cube (\\(4^3\\)).\n\n**Final Answer:** **88**\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Throughout this process, I made sure to reflect and verify each step, ensuring that the solution was accurate and met all the problem's requirements. By considering multiple strategies and double-checking my work, I was able to confidently arrive at the correct answer.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $N$ be the desired two-digit number. $N$ is divisible by 2 and by 11, and $(2,11)=1$, so $N$ is divisible by 22. Thus, $N\\in\\{22, 44, 66, 88\\}$. Only 88 is such that the product of its digits is a perfect cube ($8\\cdot8=64=4^3$), so $N=\\boxed{88}$."
