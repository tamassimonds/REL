    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would if I were solving it manually. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting often, and checking my work along the way. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n**User Query:**  \nSolve \\(8x + 1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}\\).  \nFind the solution \\(x \\equiv a \\pmod{m}\\) where \\(m \\geq 2\\) and \\(a < m\\).  \nThen, find \\(a + m\\).\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n- This looks like a linear congruence equation, which reminds me of solving equations involving modular arithmetic.\n- I recall that the goal is to find all integers \\(x\\) that satisfy the equation modulo 12.\n- I think about whether this can be solved using inverse operations, but I'm not entirely sure yet.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Isolate \\(x\\) by simplifying the equation:** Try to get \\(x\\) on one side and see if a straightforward solution emerges.\n2. **Use the Modular Inverse:** If 8 has an inverse modulo 12, multiply both sides by it to solve for \\(x\\).\n3. **Brute Force Enumeration:** Check each integer from 0 to 11 to see which satisfies the equation.\n4. **Check for Multiple Solutions:** Since we're dealing with modular arithmetic, there might be multiple valid solutions.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The first strategy seems straightforward\u2014simplify the equation and solve for \\(x\\).\n- But wait, can I directly isolate \\(x\\) with the coefficient 8 in front of it? Maybe I need to use the modular inverse here.\n- The brute force method might work too, but it feels less efficient than using the inverse.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI\u2019ll start by attempting to isolate \\(x\\) to see if it leads me directly to the solution. If that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll try using the modular inverse. If both methods don\u2019t yield a clear path, I\u2019ll reconsider and explore other strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Isolate \\(x\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The equation is \\(8x + 1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}\\).\n- To isolate \\(x\\), I should subtract 1 from both sides:  \n  \\[ 8x \\equiv 5 - 1 \\pmod{12} \\]  \n  \\[ 8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12} \\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Subtracting 1 from both sides:  \n  \\[ 8x + 1 - 1 \\equiv 5 - 1 \\pmod{12} \\]  \n  \\[ 8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12} \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Now, I have \\(8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}\\).\n- This looks more manageable.\n- But I still need to solve for \\(x\\). How can I do that?\n\n**Check:**\n- At this point, it seems like I need to divide both sides by 8.\n- However, in modular arithmetic, dividing by a number is equivalent to multiplying by its modular inverse.\n  \n**Realization:**\n- Wait, can I just divide by 8 when working modulo 12? That might not be straightforward.\n- It\u2019s better to use the modular inverse approach here to ensure correctness.\n\n**Decision:**\nSince directly dividing by 8 might be tricky, I'll proceed with finding the modular inverse of 8 modulo 12.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Modular Inverse of 8 mod 12**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To solve \\(8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}\\), I need to multiply both sides by the inverse of 8 modulo 12.\n- The modular inverse of a number \\(a\\) modulo \\(m\\) is a number \\(b\\) such that \\(a \\cdot b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}\\).\n- Therefore, I need to find \\(b\\) where \\(8b \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n- **Brute Force Approach:** Let's check each number from 1 to 11 to see which, when multiplied by 8, gives 1 modulo 12.\n\n  | \\(b\\) | \\(8 \\times b \\mod 12\\) |\n  |-------|-----------------------|\n  | 1     | \\(8 \\times 1 = 8 \\equiv 8\\) |\n  | 2     | \\(8 \\times 2 = 16 \\equiv 4\\) |\n  | 3     | \\(8 \\times 3 = 24 \\equiv 0\\) |\n  | 4     | \\(8 \\times 4 = 32 \\equiv 8\\) |\n  | 5     | \\(8 \\times 5 = 40 \\equiv 4\\) |\n  | 6     | \\(8 \\times 6 = 48 \\equiv 0\\) |\n  | 7     | \\(8 \\times 7 = 56 \\equiv 8\\) |\n  | 8     | \\(8 \\times 8 = 64 \\equiv 4\\) |\n  | 9     | \\(8 \\times 9 = 72 \\equiv 0\\) |\n  | 10    | \\(8 \\times 10 = 80 \\equiv 8\\) |\n  | 11    | \\(8 \\times 11 = 88 \\equiv 4\\) |\n\n**Reflection:**\n- None of the multiplications result in 1 modulo 12.\n- **Observation:** This suggests that 8 does not have a multiplicative inverse modulo 12.\n\n**Check:**\n- Is there a mistake in my approach?  \n  - No, I think I'm following the correct steps.\n- But if 8 doesn't have an inverse, that means simplifying \\(8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}\\) directly might require a different method.\n\n**Realization:**\n- Since 8 doesn't have an inverse modulo 12, I need to consider another way to solve the equation.\n- **Alternative Strategy:** Maybe I can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 8 and 12.\n\n**Decision:**\nBefore proceeding, let's find the gcd of 8 and 12 to see if simplification is possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Equation by Dividing by gcd(8, 12)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The gcd of 8 and 12 is 4.\n- If both sides of the equation can be divided by 4, maybe the equation simplifies to a more straightforward form.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- Divide both sides of \\(8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}\\) by 4:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{8x}{4} \\equiv \\frac{4}{4} \\pmod{\\frac{12}{4}}\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Now, the equation is \\(2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\).\n- This looks much easier to solve.\n- **Check:** Is this simplification valid?  \n  - Yes, since both sides are divisible by 4 and 12 divided by 4 is 3.\n\n**Check:**\n- Does \\(2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\) have a solution?  \n  - I can attempt to find the inverse of 2 modulo 3.\n\n**Realization:**\n- Wait, maybe I can directly find \\(x\\) by testing values since the modulus is small.\n\n**Decision:**\nI'll try solving \\(2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\) by testing small values of \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving \\(2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\) by Testing Values**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The goal is to find an integer \\(x\\) such that when multiplied by 2, the result is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n- Given that \\(m = 3\\), I can test \\(x = 0, 1, 2\\) to see which satisfies the equation.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- **For \\(x = 0\\):**  \n  \\[\n  2 \\times 0 = 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\n  \\]\n- **For \\(x = 1\\):**  \n  \\[\n  2 \\times 1 = 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\n  \\]\n- **For \\(x = 2\\):**  \n  \\[\n  2 \\times 2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- I see that \\(x = 2\\) satisfies the equation \\(2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\).\n- **Check:** Does this make sense?  \n  - Yes, multiplying 2 by 2 gives 4, which is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n\n**Realization:**\n- So, \\(x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\) is a solution.\n- But since we're dealing with modular arithmetic, there could be multiple solutions that differ by multiples of the modulus (in this case, multiples of 3).\n\n**Decision:**\nI'll express the general solution and then see if it fits the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Expressing the General Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- In modular arithmetic, if \\(x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\), it means that \\(x\\) can be written as:  \n  \\[\n  x = 2 + 3k\n  \\]  \n  where \\(k\\) is any integer.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This makes sense because adding multiples of 3 to 2 will still satisfy \\(2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\).\n\n**Check:**\n- But wait, the original equation is modulo 12, not 3.  \n  - Does this expression \\(x = 2 + 3k\\) fit within the constraints of modulo 12?\n\n**Realization:**\n- To ensure that \\(x = 2 + 3k\\) is a valid solution for the original equation \\(8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}\\), I need to check if substituting back into the original equation holds true.\n\n**Decision:**\nI\u2019ll substitute \\(x = 2 + 3k\\) back into the original equation and see if it holds for all integers \\(k\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Substituting Back into the Original Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's take \\(x = 2 + 3k\\) and substitute it back into \\(8x + 1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}\\) to verify.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- Substitute \\(x\\):  \n  \\[\n  8(2 + 3k) + 1 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  16 + 24k + 1 \\equiv 17 + 24k \\pmod{12}\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  17 + 24k \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  (17 \\mod 12) + (24k \\mod 12) \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12}\n  \\]  \n  \\[\n  5 + 0 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{12} \\quad \\text{(since \\(24k\\) is a multiple of 12)}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The equation holds true for any integer \\(k\\).\n- **Check:** This confirms that \\(x = 2 + 3k\\) is a valid solution for the original equation.\n\n**Realization:**\n- So, the general solution is \\(x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\), but to express it in the form \\(x \\equiv a \\pmod{m}\\) where \\(m \\geq 2\\) and \\(a < m\\), we identify \\(m = 3\\) and \\(a = 2\\).\n\n**Decision:**\nNow, \\(a + m = 2 + 3 = 5\\), so the solution should be \\(x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\), and thus \\(a = 2\\) and \\(m = 3\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Based on the general solution \\(x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\), I've identified \\(a = 2\\) and \\(m = 3\\).\n- Therefore, \\(a + m = 2 + 3 = 5\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- **Check:** Does this align with the requirements of the problem?  \n  - Yes, \\(m = 3\\) which is \\(\\geq 2\\), and \\(a = 2\\) which is < 3.\n\n**Realization:**\n- The solution satisfies all conditions laid out in the problem.\n\n**Decision:**\nI'm confident that the approach is correct, and the final answer is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\\[\na + m = 5\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Did the initial strategy work?**  \n  - Initially, attempting to isolate \\(x\\) didn't lead directly to a solution because 8 lacks a modular inverse modulo 12.\n- **Was an alternative approach needed?**  \n  - Yes, simplifying the equation by dividing by the gcd of 8 and 12 was essential to transforming the problem into a manageable form.\n- **Is the final answer consistent with the problem's requirements?**  \n  - Absolutely, \\(a = 2\\) and \\(m = 3\\), which satisfies \\(m \\geq 2\\) and \\(a < m\\).\n- **Would I approach similar problems differently in the future?**  \n  - Definitely, recognizing early on the need to simplify the equation by the gcd can streamline the solution process. It\u2019s a valuable lesson in not always relying on finding inverses, especially when they don't exist.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nBy exploring different strategies, reflecting on each step, and verifying the correctness through substitutions, I've arrived at a confident solution. This methodical approach ensures accuracy and builds a deeper understanding of solving linear congruences.",
