    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem and tackle it step by step, just as I would if I were working on it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on each step, and check my work along the way to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this problem, my immediate reaction is to figure out how to track the digits being written down as the integers are listed from 50 to 1. It reminds me of problems where you have to count digits in a sequence, similar to how you might find a specific digit in a long number.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure how to start. Should I write out all the numbers? That seems tedious and prone to error if I'm not careful. Maybe there's a pattern I can identify that would make it easier.\n\nI remember dealing with similar problems where breaking it down by the number of digits in each number helped. For example, counting how many single-digit, double-digit, etc., contribute to the overall sequence. Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nBut then, I think, writing out from 50 to 1 is a bit different from counting up from 1. The order will affect which digit comes where. Hmm... perhaps I need to consider how the sequence wraps around or overlaps in digit positions.\n\nOkay, let's explore starting by writing out the numbers and seeing how far that gets me. If it becomes too cumbersome, I'll pivot to counting digits by their lengths.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Writing Out the Numbers**\n\n**Step 1:** Write down the sequence from 50 to 1.\n\n\\[\n50,\\ 49,\\ 48,\\ 47,\\ 46,\\ 45,\\ 44,\\ 43,\\ 42,\\ 41,\\ 40,\\ 39,\\ 38,\\ 37,\\ 36,\\ 35,\\ 34,\\ 33,\\ 32,\\ 31,\\ 30,\\ 29,\\ 28,\\ 27,\\ 26,\\ 25,\\ 24,\\ 23,\\ 22,\\ 21,\\ 20,\\ 19,\\ 18,\\ 17,\\ 16,\\ 15,\\ 14,\\ 13,\\ 12,\\ 11,\\ 10,\\ 9,\\ 8,\\ 7,\\ 6,\\ 5,\\ 4,\\ 3,\\ 2,\\ 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** This is a long list! If I write each number out completely, counting to the 67th digit could take a while. Maybe I should consider counting the digits in blocks or by number lengths to make it easier.\n\n**Check:** Wait, this doesn't seem efficient. I could easily miscount or lose track. I think writing out every number manually isn't the best approach.\n\n**Realization:** Writing each number is too time-consuming and prone to errors. I need a better strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 2: Counting Digits by Number Lengths**\n\n**Step 2:** Consider how many digits each group of numbers contributes.\n\n- **Two-Digit Numbers (50 to 10):** Each of these numbers has 2 digits.\n- **Single-Digit Numbers (9 to 1):** Each of these numbers has 1 digit.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the total number of digits contributed by each group.\n\n- **Two-Digit Numbers:**\n  - Range: 50 to 10\n  - Total numbers: \\(50 - 10 + 1 = 41\\)\n  - Digits contributed: \\(41 \\times 2 = 82\\)\n\n- **Single-Digit Numbers:**\n  - Range: 9 to 1\n  - Total numbers: \\(9 - 1 + 1 = 9\\)\n  - Digits contributed: \\(9 \\times 1 = 9\\)\n\n**Step 4:** Add the total digits from both groups.\n\n\\[\n82\\ (\\text{two-digit}) + 9\\ (\\text{single-digit}) = 91\\ \\text{digits}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Okay, so the entire sequence has 91 digits in total. If I need to find the 67th digit, it's within the two-digit numbers since 67 is less than 82.\n\n**Check:** This makes sense. If the total is 91 digits, the 67th digit lies within the first 82 (from the two-digit numbers), so I don't need to worry about the single-digit numbers affecting the position.\n\n**Realization:** By segmenting the counting by number lengths, I've narrowed down where the 67th digit falls without writing out every single number.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 3: Identifying the Position Within Two-Digit Numbers**\n\n**Step 5:** Determine which two-digit number contains the 67th digit.\n\n**Thought Process:** Since each two-digit number contributes 2 digits, I'll divide 67 by 2 to find out how many full two-digit numbers fit into the first 67 digits.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of complete two-digit numbers} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{67}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 33\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Wait a minute, if I have 33 complete two-digit numbers, that only accounts for \\(33 \\times 2 = 66\\) digits. The 67th digit must be the first digit of the next two-digit number.\n\n**Realization:** The 67th digit is in the 34th two-digit number.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 4: Identifying the 34th Two-Digit Number**\n\n**Step 6:** Find out what the 34th two-digit number is.\n\n**Thought Process:** The sequence starts at 50 and counts downwards. So, the n-th two-digit number can be found by subtracting (n-1) from 50.\n\n\\[\n\\text{34th two-digit number} = 50 - (34 - 1) = 50 - 33 = 17\n\\]\n\n**Check:** Is 17 the correct position? Let's verify:\n\n- The first two-digit number is 50.\n- Counting downwards:\n  - 1st: 50\n  - 2nd: 49\n  - 3rd: 48\n  - ...\n  - 34th: 17\n\nThis seems correct.\n\n**Realization:** The 34th two-digit number is indeed 17, so the 67th digit corresponds to the first digit of 17.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Steps: Determining the 67th Digit**\n\n**Step 7:** Identifying the first digit of the number 17.\n\n\\[\n\\text{First digit of 17} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** It all aligns. The 67th digit falls right at the beginning of the number 17, which is 1.\n\n**Check:** Just to be sure, let's recap:\n\n- Total digits from two-digit numbers: 82\n- Two-digit numbers accounted for up to the 66th digit\n- The 67th digit is the first digit of the 34th two-digit number (17), which is 1\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and checking my work along the way, I've determined that the 67th digit in the sequence is **1**. By breaking down the problem into manageable parts\u2014starting with counting digits by number lengths and then pinpointing the specific number and its digit\u2014I was able to arrive at the correct answer without getting bogged down by writing out each number individually.",
