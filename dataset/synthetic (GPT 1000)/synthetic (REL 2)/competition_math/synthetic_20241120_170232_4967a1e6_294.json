    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, thinking through it just like I would if I were tackling it myself. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether they're working, check my progress frequently, and be open to changing my approach if something doesn't seem right.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first read the question, a few things pop into my mind:\n\n1. **Card Types and Sides:** I remember there are three types of cards based on their colors and how many sides are colored: \n   - **Black on both sides (3 cards)**\n   - **Black on one side and Red on the other (1 card)**\n   - **Red on both sides (2 cards)**\n\n2. **Random Selection:** We're picking a card uniformly at random and then looking at one side. This seems like a classic probability problem involving conditional probabilities.\n\n3. **Given a Red Side:** Ah, the condition \"given that the side you see is red\" changes everything. It narrows down our sample space significantly.\n\nAt this point, I'm recalling similar problems I've encountered where conditional probability plays a key role. But I'm not yet sure about the best strategy to approach it.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **List All Possible Outcomes:**\n   - Maybe I should list all possible ways to pick a card and see a red side to understand the sample space better.\n\n2. **Use Conditional Probability:**\n   - I could directly apply the formula for conditional probability since we're given a specific side.\n\n3. **Bayes' Theorem:**\n   - Or perhaps Bayes' Theorem might help here since we're dealing with cards having multiple sides.\n\n4. **Simplify the Sample Space:**\n   - Another idea is to simplify the sample space by removing all scenarios that don't meet the given condition.\n\nHmm, listing all possible outcomes seems like a good starting point to get a clear picture. Let's try that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Listing All Possible Outcomes**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIf I list all the sides of all the cards, I can see how many red sides there are in total and how many of those have the other side also red.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n- **Black on Both Sides (3 cards):** Each has 2 black sides \u2192 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 black sides\n- **Black on One Side, Red on the Other (1 card):** 1 black side, 1 red side \u2192 2 sides\n- **Red on Both Sides (2 cards):** Each has 2 red sides \u2192 2 \u00d7 2 = 4 red sides\n\n**Total Sides:**\n- Black: 6\n- Red: 6\n\n**Total Sides = 6 Black + 6 Red = 12 Sides**\n\nWait a minute... This doesn't seem right for the totals. Let's double-check:\n\n- **Black on Both Sides:** 3 cards \u00d7 2 sides = **6 black sides**\n- **Black and Red:** 1 card \u00d7 2 sides = **2 sides** (1 black, 1 red)\n- **Red on Both Sides:** 2 cards \u00d7 2 sides = **4 red sides**\n\nSo, the correct totals should be:\n- **Black:** 6\n- **Red:** 6\n\n**Reflection:**\nThe total sides are indeed 12, with an equal number of black and red sides. This symmetry is interesting and might simplify calculations later.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Focusing on the Given Condition**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nNow that I know how many red sides there are in total, I can focus on those specific cases where the other side is also red.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n- **Red on Both Sides (2 cards):** Each has 2 red sides \u2192 2 cards \u00d7 2 = **4 red sides**\n- **Black and Red (1 card):** 1 red side \u2192 **1 red side**\n\nSo, there are **4 + 1 = 5 red sides** where at least one side is red.\n\nBut wait, the sample space should only consider these **5 red sides**, and I need to find out of these, how many have the other side also red.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems to lower the sample space, making it easier to calculate probabilities. Let's proceed with this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI have the reduced sample space where the visible side is red. Now, I need to find the probability that the other side is also red.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\nUsing conditional probability:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Other side is red | One side is red}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Both sides are red and one is red})}{P(\\text{At least one side is red})}\n\\]\n\n**Numerator (Both sides are red and one is red):**\n\n- **Red on Both Sides:** Already counted as **4**\n  \n  (Wait, but seeing one side red includes all four red sides, so this part is already covered.)\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, I might be overcounting here. Seeing one red side doesn't necessarily mean both sides are red, especially with cards like \"Black and Red.\" Let me rethink this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Adjusting the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIt seems I need to consider only those cases where the visible red side has the other side also red. Perhaps a different strategy would be better to avoid overcounting.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\nLet's focus solely on the cases where both sides are red and see how they fit into the overall probability.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1. **Total Favorable Outcomes:**\n   - **Red on Both Sides:** 2 cards \u00d7 2 sides = **4**\n   \n2. **Total Possible Outcomes Given Red Side:**\n   - **Red on Both Sides:** 4\n   - **Black and Red:** 1 (since only one side is red)\n   \n   So, total = **4 + 1 = 5**\n\nWait, this still seems off. I think I'm mixing up the favorable and possible outcomes.\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis is getting confusing. Perhaps I need to go back and verify the sample space more carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Re-examining the Sample Space**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's revisit the sample space considering only the red sides and see how many of those have the other side also red.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1. **Red on Both Sides (2 cards):** Each has 2 red sides \u2192 **4 sides**\n   \n2. **Black and Red (1 card):** 1 red side \u2192 **1 side**\n   \nTotal red sides = **4 + 1 = 5**\n\n**Check:**\nBut, according to the original problem, there are 6 red sides in total (from both card types), so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\n**Reflection:**\nI'm mixing up the sides here. The total number of red sides is **6**, but I'm only counting **5**. Let's see what I'm missing.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Identifying the Miscount**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI know there are **6 red sides** in total, but I'm only accounting for **5**. Let me trace back my steps to see where I went wrong.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\nPreviously:\n\n- **Red on Both Sides:** 4 sides\n- **Black and Red:** 1 side\n\nTotal counted = **5**\n\nBut, according to the problem, there should be **6 red sides**. What am I missing?\n\n**Reflection:**\nI remember that each \"Black and Red\" card contributes **2** sides (1 black, 1 red), but I only counted **1** red side earlier. Let me correct this.\n\n**Correction:**\n\n- **Red on Both Sides:** 4 sides\n- **Black and Red:** 1 red side already counted\n\nSo, perhaps I'm double-counting the red side from the \"Black and Red\" card.\n\n**New Calculation:**\n\nTotal red sides = 4 (from \"Red on Both Sides\") + 1 (from \"Black and Red\") = **5**\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis still doesn't match the total of **6**. Let me re-check.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Finalizing the Sample Space**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to ensure that all **6 red sides** are accounted for without double-counting.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\nLet's list them again:\n\n1. **Red on Both Sides (2 cards):** \n   - Card 1: Red Side A, Red Side B \u2192 **2 sides**\n   - Card 2: Red Side C, Red Side D \u2192 **2 sides**\n   \n   Total = **4 red sides**\n\n2. **Black and Red (1 card):**\n   - Red Side E, Black Side F \u2192 **1 red side**\n\nTotal red sides = **4 + 1 = 5**\n\nWait, I'm still off by 1. Let's see.\n\n**Reflection:**\nI might have miscounted earlier. Let me go back and see what I'm missing.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Spotting the Mistake**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI realize that I need to consider all red sides across both types of cards without double-counting.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1. **Red on Both Sides (2 cards):** **4 red sides**\n2. **Black and Red (1 card):** **1 red side**\n\nTotal = **5**\n\nBut, I know there are **6 red sides** in total according to the problem. What am I missing?\n\n**Wait, maybe...**\n\nAh, perhaps I need to consider that each **\"Black and Red\"** card has **1 red side**, and by initially counting only one, I might have missed another.\n\n**Correction:**\n\n- **Red on Both Sides:** 4 sides\n- **Black and Red:** 1 side (but there should be 2 sides: 1 red, 1 black)\n\nThus, total red sides = **4 + 1 = 5**\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, this still doesn't match. Let me think about it differently.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 9: Simplifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nPerhaps I need to rethink how I'm counting the sides to avoid confusion.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\nLet's focus on the probability without getting bogged down by the specific side counts.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1. **Given a Red Side:** \n   - **Red on Both Sides:** Contributes to the probability since both sides are red.\n   - **Black and Red:** Only contributes if the visible side is red and the other side is black.\n\n2. **Total Favorable Cases:**\n   - **Red on Both Sides:** All four cases (seeing one red side implies the other is also red)\n   - **Black and Red:** Only one case where the visible red side has the other side black\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable cases}}{\\text{Total number of possible cases given red side}}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis makes sense. Now, I just need to ensure I correctly count the favorable cases.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 10: Correctly Counting Favorable Cases**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet's carefully count the favorable cases where the other side is also red.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1. **Red on Both Sides:** \n   - Seeing one red side means the other side is also red.\n   - **2 cards \u00d7 2 sides = 4 favorable cases**\n   \n2. **Black and Red:** \n   - Only one side is red, so the other side is black.\n   - But since we're given a red side, this doesn't contribute to favorable cases where the other side is red.\n\n**Total Favorable Cases:**\n- **Red on Both Sides:** 4\n- **Black and Red:** 0\n\nReflection: **Total Favorable Cases = 4**\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems reasonable. Now, let's calculate the total possible cases given a red side.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 11: Calculating Total Possible Cases Given a Red Side**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI need to count all possible ways to see a red side.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1. **Red on Both Sides:** \n   - **2 cards \u00d7 2 sides = 4 cases**\n   \n2. **Black and Red:** \n   - **1 card \u00d7 1 red side = 1 case**\n   \n**Total Possible Cases:**\n- **Red on Both Sides:** 4\n- **Black and Red:** 1\n\nReflection: **Total Possible Cases = 5**\n\n**Reflection:**\nNow, I have both the numerator and denominator for the probability.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 12: Calculating the Probability**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nUsing the favorable and possible cases, I can now calculate the probability.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable cases}}{\\text{Total number of possible cases given red side}} = \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems correct. By focusing only on the cases where the other side is also red and ensuring accurate counting, I've arrived at the probability.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore finalizing, let's double-check the sample space and probability calculation to ensure everything makes sense.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n1. **Sample Space Given Red Side:**\n   - **Red on Both Sides:** 4 cases (both sides red)\n   - **Black and Red:** 1 case (one side red, other side black)\n\n   Total = **5 cases**\n\n2. **Favorable Cases (Other Side Red):**\n   - **Red on Both Sides:** 4 cases\n   - **Black and Red:** 0 cases\n\n   Total = **4 cases**\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nEverything checks out. The probability is indeed \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully analyzing the sample space and distinguishing between favorable and possible cases, we've determined that the probability of the other side being red, given that one side is red, is **\\(\\frac{4}{5}\\)**. Throughout the process, reflecting and adjusting the approach was crucial to ensure accurate counting and avoid overcounting.\n\n---",

  "ground_truth": "Consider the two different faces of each card as distinct items at first. Since we have two completely red cards and one half-red card, we have a total of 5 red card-sides. So, since we are looking at a red face, we know we have one of these 5 red card-sides. 4 of these are located on a completely red card, and turning it over will reveal another red face. So the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$."
