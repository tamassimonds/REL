I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect on whether each approach works, and make adjustments as needed. I'll think out loud, check my work frequently, and be open to exploring new directions if I get stuck.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first read the problem, it says:\n\n\"When the square of three times a positive integer is decreased by the integer, the result is \\$2010. What is the integer?\"\n\nImmediately, this reminds me of quadratic equations because we're dealing with squares and linear terms. But before jumping into that, let's unpack the problem to make sure I understand it fully.\n\n- **Key Components:**\n  - The square of three times a positive integer: This suggests taking an integer, multiplying it by three, and then squaring the result.\n  - Decreased by the integer: Subtract the original integer from the squared value.\n  - The result is \\$2010: After the subtraction, the result equals 2010.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- Maybe I can set up an equation based on this description.\n- Alternatively, I could look for patterns or perhaps factor the expression if it leads to a familiar form.\n- Another idea is to plug in some small integers to see if I can find a solution that way.\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up an Equation**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the equation approach since it seems the most straightforward.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let\u2019s denote the unknown positive integer as \\( n \\).\n- According to the problem, the square of three times \\( n \\) decreased by \\( n \\) equals 2010.\n\n**Mathematical Representation:**\n\\[\n(3n)^2 - n = 2010\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Equation:**\n\\[\n9n^2 - n = 2010\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Okay, that looks like a standard quadratic equation format\u2014\\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n- I know I can solve quadratic equations using factoring, the quadratic formula, or completing the square. But first, let's see if factoring works.\n\n### **Step 2: Attempting to Factor the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Maybe this equation can be factored into two binomials. That would make finding the roots easier.\n- Let\u2019s rearrange the equation to set it to zero:\n  \\[\n  9n^2 - n - 2010 = 0\n  \\]\n- Now, I need to find two numbers that multiply to \\( 9 \\times -2010 = -18090 \\) and add up to \\( -1 \\) (the coefficient of \\( n \\)).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Wait, multiplying to \\(-18090\\) and adding to \\(-1\\) seems a bit tricky.\n- Let me think about the factors of \\(-18090\\). This might take a while, and maybe there's a more straightforward way.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since factoring isn't jumping out at me right away, perhaps using the quadratic formula would be more efficient.\n- The quadratic formula is:\n  \\[\n  n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n  \\]\n- For our equation \\( 9n^2 - n - 2010 = 0 \\):\n  - \\( a = 9 \\)\n  - \\( b = -1 \\)\n  - \\( c = -2010 \\)\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4 \\times 9 \\times (-2010)}}{2 \\times 9}\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 72360}}{18}\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{72361}}{18}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Let me quickly check if \\( 72361 \\) is a perfect square.\n- Hmm, looking at it, \\( 270^2 = 72900 \\) and \\( 260^2 = 67600 \\), so \\( 72361 \\) is between those.\n- I need to find the square root, but since it's close to \\( 72900 \\), it might be around \\( 269.7 \\). But is this exact?\n\n### **Step 3: Checking if \\( 72361 \\) is a Perfect Square**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let me see if \\( 72361 \\) is a perfect square. If it is, the quadratic formula will give me an integer solution.\n- Let's check:\n  \\[\n  269^2 = 72361\n  \\]\n- Wait, let me calculate that:\n  \\[\n  269 \\times 269 = 72361\n  \\]\n  \n**Realization:**\n- Oh! It is a perfect square! That's great because this means the quadratic formula will give us an exact integer solution.\n\n**Calculating \\( n \\):**\n\\[\nn = \\frac{1 \\pm 269}{18}\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{270}{18} = 15 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad n = \\frac{-268}{18} \\approx -14.89\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Since we're looking for a positive integer, \\( n = 15 \\) is the only viable solution.\n- Let\u2019s pause here and do a quick check to ensure this makes sense.\n\n### **Step 4: Quick Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before finalizing, let\u2019s plug \\( n = 15 \\) back into the original problem to see if it satisfies the equation.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. Three times the integer:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 15 = 45\n   \\]\n2. Square of that result:\n   \\[\n   45^2 = 2025\n   \\]\n3. Decrease by the integer:\n   \\[\n   2025 - 15 = 2010\n   \\]\n4. Result:\n   \\[\n   2010 = 2010 \\quad \\text{(True)}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Yup, the calculation checks out! \\( n = 15 \\) satisfies the original equation perfectly.\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **Brainstorming Worked:** Initially, I considered setting up an equation, factoring, and using the quadratic formula. When factoring seemed cumbersome, switching to the quadratic formula made the problem manageable.\n- **Checking Along the Way:** Regular checks ensured that the steps were correct, leading to the correct integer solution.\n- **Realization Moments:** Discovering \\( 72361 \\) was a perfect square was a key insight that simplified the calculation.\n- **Final Reflection:** The integer that satisfies the condition is \\( n = 15 \\). Everything aligns with the original problem's requirements.\n\nThis step-by-step approach, with constant reflection and adjustments, led us to the correct solution. It\u2019s essential to remain flexible and open to changing strategies when one approach doesn\u2019t seem to work effectively.",

  "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the positive integer. The problem implies that $(3x)^2 - x = 2010$, or re-arranging, that $9x^2 - x - 2010 = 0$. Suppose this factors as $9x^2 - x - 2010 = (ax+b)(cx+d) = acx^2 + (bc + ad)x + bd$. We can factor $2010 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 67$. If both $a$ and $c$ are divisible by $3$, then $bc + ad$ is also divisible by $3$, which is not the case. Thus, one of $a$ and $c$ is equal to $9$, and the other is equal to $1$; we will choose $a = 9$. Then $b + 9d = -1$ and $bd = 2010$; after a bit of experimentation, we find that $b= 2 \\cdot 67, d = 3 \\cdot 5$ works. Thus, $$9x^2 - x - 2010 = (9x + 134)(x - 15) = 0,$$ and since $x$ is a positive integer, then $x = \\boxed{15}$."
