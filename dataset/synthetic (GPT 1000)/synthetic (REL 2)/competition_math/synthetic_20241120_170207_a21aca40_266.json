Let's see where this takes us.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first glance at the question, it says: **\"A fair 6-sided die is rolled. What is the probability that the number rolled is a divisor of 6?\"**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Okay, we're dealing with a 6-sided die. Each side has a number from 1 to 6. I remember that 6 has certain divisors. Wait, let me think\u2014what are the divisors of 6 again? Hmm, I think they are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Does that sound right? \n\n- **Connecting Ideas:** This reminds me of basic probability problems where you determine favorable outcomes over possible outcomes. But I want to be sure I'm not overlooking anything.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **List the Outcomes:** Maybe I can list all possible numbers on the die and see which ones are divisors of 6.\n  2. **Probability Formula:** Use the probability formula \\( P = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \\).\n  3. **Set Approach:** Consider setting up a sample space and identifying the divisors within it.\n\n- **Exploring the First Strategy:** I think starting by listing the outcomes would give me a clear picture. Let me try that.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: List the Possible Outcomes**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Let's enumerate all the possible numbers that can come up when rolling a fair 6-sided die.\n\n- **Calculation:** The die has sides numbered 1 through 6:\n  \\[\n  \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Wait, that part seems straightforward. Each number is equally likely since the die is fair.\n\n- **Reflection:** Okay, so we have six possible outcomes. Now, I need to identify which of these are divisors of 6.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Divisors of 6**\n\n- **Thought Process:** I remember that a divisor of a number is an integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder. Let me quickly list the divisors of 6 to see which ones are on the die.\n\n- **Calculation:** The divisors of 6 are:\n  \\[\n  1, 2, 3, 6\n  \\]\n  \n  (Checking: \\(6 = 1 \\times 6, 2 \\times 3\\))\n\n- **Check:** All these numbers\u20141, 2, 3, and 6\u2014are on the die. But wait, 4 and 5 are also on the die but aren't divisors of 6. Need to ensure I'm only counting 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\n- **Reflection:** That makes sense. So, there are four favorable outcomes: 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Probability Using the Formula**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Now that I have the number of favorable outcomes, I can use the probability formula to find the probability.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  P(\\text{Divisor of 6}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \\frac{4}{6}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying the Fraction:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Check:** Wait, let me double-check. There are six possible outcomes, and four of them (1, 2, 3, 6) are divisors of 6. Dividing 4 by 6 simplifies to \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). That seems correct.\n\n- **Reflection:** So, the probability is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). This aligns with my initial thoughts. But let me think if there's another way to verify this.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Alternative Verification Approach**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Sometimes, it's good to look at the problem from a different angle to ensure the answer is robust. Maybe I can consider the complementary probability\u2014calculating the probability of rolling a number that's *not* a divisor of 6 and subtracting from 1.\n\n- **Calculation:**\n  - **Outcomes Not Divisors of 6:** These would be 4 and 5.\n  - **Number of unfavorable outcomes:** 2 (since 4 and 5 are the only numbers not divisors of 6)\n  - **Probability of not rolling a divisor of 6:**\n    \\[\n    P(\\text{Not a divisor of 6}) = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n    \\]\n  - **Probability of rolling a divisor of 6:**\n    \\[\n    P(\\text{Divisor of 6}) = 1 - P(\\text{Not a divisor of 6}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n    \\]\n\n- **Check:** This alternative method also gives \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). That's reassuring.\n\n- **Reflection:** Both approaches lead to the same probability. This consistency strengthens the validity of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Before finalizing, let me quickly review each step to ensure there's no mistake.\n\n- **Review:**\n  - **Step 1:** Listed all possible outcomes correctly.\n  - **Step 2:** Identified divisors of 6 accurately.\n  - **Step 3:** Correctly applied the probability formula and simplified the fraction.\n  - **Step 4:** Verified the answer using the complementary probability approach.\n\n- **Check:** Everything checks out. The probability is consistently \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n- **Reflection:** I feel confident that the answer is correct. Using multiple strategies helped confirm the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies\u2014listening possible outcomes, identifying divisors, applying the probability formula, and verifying through complementary probability\u2014I've determined that the probability of rolling a divisor of 6 on a fair 6-sided die is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach, along with checking and reflecting at each stage, ensured a thorough and accurate solution. Always good to brainstorm and reconsider strategies to catch any potential errors!",
