Finding the domain of a real-valued function involving a square root can be tricky, so I want to make sure I brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work as I go.\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I see the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{-10x^2 - 11x + 6} \\), my immediate reaction is to ensure that the expression under the square root (the radicand) is non-negative. After all, you can only take the square root of a non-negative number to get a real value. So, my goal is to find all \\( x \\) values where:\n\n\\[\n-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nThis looks like a quadratic inequality, which I've dealt with before. In those cases, I typically think about:\n\n1. **Graphing the Quadratic**: Would plotting the parabola help me visualize where it's above the x-axis?\n2. **Finding Roots**: Maybe setting the quadratic equal to zero to find the points where it touches or crosses the x-axis.\n3. **Using the Quadratic Formula**: This could give me the exact points where the quadratic equals zero.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n- **Strategy 1: Graphing the Quadratic**\n\n  I could try sketching the graph of \\( y = -10x^2 - 11x + 6 \\) to see where it intersects the x-axis. If it opens downwards (which it does since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is negative), the areas above the x-axis would be the parts where the expression under the square root is non-negative.\n\n- **Strategy 2: Factoring the Quadratic**\n\n  Maybe I can factor the quadratic to find the roots directly. If factoring is straightforward, this could give me the x-intercepts easily.\n\n- **Strategy 3: Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\n  If factoring doesn't work or seems complex, the quadratic formula is a reliable method to find the roots.\n\nAll these strategies point towards finding the roots of the quadratic equation. Once I have the roots, I can determine the intervals where the quadratic is non-negative.\n\n### **Let\u2019s Start with Strategy 1: Graphing the Quadratic**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nMaybe sketching the graph will give me an intuitive understanding. However, since I'm only writing this out, I'll describe what I would expect:\n\n- The parabola opens downwards because the leading coefficient (-10) is negative.\n- There should be two real roots if the discriminant is positive, meaning the quadratic crosses the x-axis at two points.\n- The regions where the parabola is above the x-axis (i.e., where the quadratic is non-negative) would be between these two roots.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBut wait, without actually graphing, I'm not sure if this approach will give me exact endpoints. It\u2019s more of a visual strategy. Maybe I should combine this with finding the roots mathematically to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Check:**\n\nDoes this seem like a good start? I think using graphing along with finding the exact roots would give me a solid answer. Let's proceed with finding the roots to get exact values.\n\n### **Moving to Strategy 3: Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\n**Running the Quadratic Formula:**\n\nThe standard form of a quadratic equation is \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\). For our equation:\n\n\\[\na = -10, \\quad b = -11, \\quad c = 6\n\\]\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Discriminant \\( D \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   D = b^2 - 4ac = (-11)^2 - 4 \\times (-10) \\times 6 = 121 + 240 = 361\n   \\]\n\n   **Reflection:**\n\n   The discriminant is positive (\\( D = 361 \\)), which means there are two distinct real roots.\n\n2. **Compute the Roots:**\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{361}}{-20} = \\frac{11 \\pm 19}{-20}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   x_1 = \\frac{30}{-20} = -\\frac{3}{2}, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{-8}{-20} = \\frac{2}{5}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, the roots are \\( x = -\\frac{3}{2} \\) and \\( x = \\frac{2}{5} \\). This tells me that the quadratic touches or crosses the x-axis at these points.\n\n### **Now, Checking the Quadratic:**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore proceeding, let me quickly verify if these roots make sense:\n\n- When \\( x = -\\frac{3}{2} \\):\n\n  \\[\n  f\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\sqrt{-10\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - 11\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) + 6} = \\sqrt{-10 \\times \\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{33}{2} + 6} = \\sqrt{-22.5 + 16.5 + 6} = \\sqrt{0} = 0\n  \\]\n\n- When \\( x = \\frac{2}{5} \\):\n\n  \\[\n  f\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = \\sqrt{-10\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^2 - 11\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) + 6} = \\sqrt{-10 \\times \\frac{4}{25} - \\frac{22}{5} + 6} = \\sqrt{-\\frac{40}{25} - \\frac{110}{25} + \\frac{150}{25}} = \\sqrt{-1.6 - 4.4 + 6} = \\sqrt{0} = 0\n  \\]\n\n**Check:**\n\nBoth roots yield \\( f(x) = 0 \\), which is expected since they are the points where the quadratic equals zero. This verifies that the roots are correct.\n\n### **Next Step: Determining the Domain**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the roots, I need to find the intervals where the quadratic is non-negative:\n\n\\[\n-10x^2 - 11x + 6 \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nGiven that the parabola opens downwards, the quadratic will be non-negative between the two roots.\n\nSo, the domain of \\( f(x) \\) is:\n\n\\[\nx \\in \\left[-\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{2}{5}\\right]\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis makes sense because between the roots, the quadratic is above the x-axis. Outside of \\( x = -\\frac{3}{2} \\) and \\( x = \\frac{2}{5} \\), the quadratic is negative, making the square root undefined for real numbers.\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring Correctness**\n\n**Quick Check:**\n\nDoes the interval \\( \\left[-\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{2}{5}\\right] \\) make sense?\n\n- The endpoints \\( x = -\\frac{3}{2} \\) and \\( x = \\frac{2}{5} \\) yield \\( f(x) = 0 \\), which is valid for the square root.\n- The parabola is concave down, so between these points, the expression under the square root is non-negative.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nEverything checks out. The domain is correctly identified as \\( \\left[-\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{2}{5}\\right] \\).\n\n### **Alternative Strategy: Factoring the Quadratic**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nJust to explore another method, let's see if the quadratic can be factored. If so, this could provide another way to find the roots.\n\nThe quadratic is:\n\n\\[\n-10x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Attempt at Factoring:**\n\nLet's try factoring by looking for two numbers that multiply to \\( a \\times c = -10 \\times 6 = -60 \\) and add to \\( b = -11 \\).\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n- \\( -15 \\) and \\( 4 \\) (since \\( -15 \\times 4 = -60 \\) and \\( -15 + 4 = -11 \\))\n\n**Factoring the Quadratic:**\n\n\\[\n-10x^2 - 15x + 4x + 6 = 0\n\\]\n\nGroup terms:\n\n\\[\n(-10x^2 - 15x) + (4x + 6) = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor by grouping:\n\n\\[\n-5x(2x + 3) + 2(2x + 3) = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor out the common term:\n\n\\[\n(2x + 3)(-5x + 2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Finding the Roots:**\n\nSet each factor to zero:\n\n1. \\( 2x + 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -\\frac{3}{2} \\)\n2. \\( -5x + 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{2}{5} \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nFactoring gives us the same roots as the quadratic formula. This confirms that both methods are valid and yield the same result.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying the correctness through checking and reflection, the domain of the function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{-10x^2 - 11x + 6} \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left[-\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{2}{5}\\right]}\n\\]\n\nThis interval ensures that the expression under the square root is non-negative, allowing \\( f(x) \\) to take real values.",

  "ground_truth": "We need $-10x^2-11x+6\\geq 0$.  The quadratic factors as $$(2x+3)(-5x+2) \\ge 0.$$ Thus the zeroes of the quadratic are at $-\\frac{3}{2}$ and $\\frac{2}{5}$.  Since the quadratic opens downward, it is nonnegative between the zeroes.  So the domain is $x \\in \\boxed{\\left[-\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{2}{5}\\right]}$."
