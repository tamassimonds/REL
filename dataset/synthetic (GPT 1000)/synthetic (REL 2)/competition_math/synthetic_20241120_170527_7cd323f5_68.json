    "working_out": "Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, mimicking a human thought process with brainstorming, reflecting, checking, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** Looking at the problem, it involves finding the area between the graph of \\( y = f(x) \\) and the \\( x \\)-axis, specifically for \\( y = 3f(x - 2) \\). \n- **Familiarity:** This reminds me of transformations in functions, like scaling and shifting. I think I've encountered questions where scaling affects the area under a curve. \n- **Uncertainty:** I'm not entirely sure how shifting the graph will impact the area, as I don't recall dealing with that directly. Scaling seems more straightforward.\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Apply Scaling and Shifting Rules:** Recall how multiplying and shifting a function affects its graph and, consequently, the area under it.\n2. **Break Down the Transformation:** Analyze each part of the transformation \\( 3f(x - 2) \\) separately\u2014scaling by 3 and shifting by 2 units.\n3. **Think About the Given Area:** Since the original area is 10 square units, consider how transformations would modify this area.\n\n**Exploring Approach:**\n\n- **Scaling (Multiplying by 3):** My initial thought is that multiplying \\( f(x) \\) by 3 would triple the area since scaling vertically by a factor affects the height of the graph.\n- **Shifting (Subtracting 2 from \\( x \\)):** But then, I remember shifting horizontally doesn't change the area under the curve; it merely moves the graph left or right.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Check on Scaling:** Multiplying by 3 seems correct for increasing the area.\n- **Check on Shifting:** Does shifting affect the area? From what I know, horizontal shifts don't impact the area between the curve and the \\( x \\)-axis.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scaling by 3 should increase the area by a factor of 3, and shifting by 2 units does not affect the area. This seems to align with my initial thoughts.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Scaling Transformation**\n\n**Proceeding with Scaling:**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Since multiplying \\( f(x) \\) by 3 affects the vertical stretch of the graph, the area under the curve should be multiplied by 3.\n- **Calculation:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{New Area} = 3 \\times \\text{Original Area} = 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ square units}\n  \\]\n  \n**Checking the Work:**\n\n- **Quick Check:** Multiplying 10 by 3 gives 30, which makes sense as the height of the curve is tripled.\n- **Reflection:** This seems correct because scaling vertically directly affects the area under the curve.\n\n**Next Thought:**\n\n- **Is This Enough?** Wait, but the transformation also involves shifting the graph. Should I consider that part too?\n\n**Realization:**\n\n- **Shifting Doesn't Affect Area:** I recall that horizontal shifts (like \\( f(x - 2) \\)) do not change the area between the curve and the \\( x \\)-axis since they only move the graph left or right.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering the Shifting Transformation**\n\n**Thinking About Shifting:**\n\n- **Impact of \\( x - 2 \\):** Shifting \\( f(x) \\) to \\( f(x - 2) \\) means moving the graph 2 units to the right.\n- **Area Implications:** From what I know, this shift doesn't alter the area because it doesn't change the height or width of the graph\u2014just its position.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does This Make Sense?** Shifting the graph doesn't stretch or compress it vertically or horizontally, so the area remains affected only by the scaling.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Consistency with Previous Approach:** Adding this consideration confirms that only the scaling factor affects the area. The shifting part is already accounted for by adjusting \\( x \\) to \\( x - 2 \\), but it doesn't contribute to changing the area.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finalizing the Calculation**\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\n- **Applying Both Transformations:** Since the only transformation affecting the area is the scaling by 3, the area becomes:\n  \\[\n  \\text{New Area} = 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ square units}\n  \\]\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n- **Does This Align with Expectations?** Tripling the area makes sense given the vertical scaling. The shifting doesn't alter the area, and the calculation aligns with the logic applied.\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Confidence in Answer:** I'm confident in the result. The scaling transformation directly affects the area, while the shifting transformation has no impact on it.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Cross-Verification with Another Strategy**\n\n**Brainstorming Alternative Approach:**\n\n- **Calculate Area Before and After Transformations Separately:** What if I consider how the area changes with each transformation one by one?\n\n**Exploring Strategy:**\n\n1. **Shift the Graph First:** Consider the area of \\( f(x) \\) shifted to \\( f(x - 2) \\).\n2. **Scale the Shifted Graph:** Then, apply the scaling factor of 3 to \\( f(x - 2) \\).\n\n**Checking Feasibility:**\n\n- **Wait, Does It Change Anything?** Thinking this through, shifting the graph doesn't affect the area, so the only impactful transformation remains the scaling by 3.\n\n**Realization:**\n\n- **Reinforcing Previous Conclusion:** Applying transformations separately leads to the same conclusion that only scaling affects the area.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Concluding the Solution**\n\n**Wrapping Up:**\n\n- **Single Transformation Effect:** Regardless of whether we consider the transformations sequentially or apply them directly, the scaling by 3 is the only factor that alters the area under the curve.\n- **Final Area Calculation:** \n  \\[\n  \\text{New Area} = 3 \\times 10 = 30 \\text{ square units}\n  \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{30 \\text{ square units}}\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Validation of Approach:** Throughout the steps, checking each transformation's impact confirmed that only the vertical scaling affects the area. The horizontal shift was correctly deemed non-influential.\n- **Confidence in Result:** The systematic approach, alongside cross-verifying with alternative strategies, ensures the answer is accurate and aligned with the problem's requirements.\n\n---\n\nThis step-by-step process, including brainstorming, exploring different strategies, reflecting, and continuously checking the work, led to a confident and accurate determination of the area between the graph of \\( y = 3f(x - 2) \\) and the \\( x \\)-axis as 30 square units.",

  "ground_truth": "The graph of $y=f(x-2)$ is just the graph of $y=f(x)$ shifted two units to the right. To see this, note that if $(a,b)$ is a point on the graph of $y=f(x)$, then $(a+2,b)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x-2)$. Then the graph of $y=3f(x-2)$ is the graph of $y=f(x-2)$ scaled by a factor of 3 in the vertical direction. To see this, note that if $(a,b)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x-2)$, then $(a,3b)$ is on the graph of $y=3f(x-2)$. Stretching a region in the plane by a factor of 3 in one dimension increases its area by a factor of 3, so the area between the graph of $y=3f(x-2)$ and the $x$-axis is $\\boxed{30}$."
