    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, mimicking a human thought process with brainstorming, checking, reflecting, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n## **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)!}\n\\]\n\nmy initial reaction is to think about factorials and how they relate to each other. Factorials deal with multiplying a series of descending positive integers, which is something I've encountered before. \n\nHowever, I notice that this expression involves both \\(N\\) and \\(N+1\\) in the factorials, and I'm tempted to manipulate it by expanding the factorials. But then I remember that there might be a simplification involving properties of factorials that could make the calculation easier.\n\n## **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Expand Factorials**: Write out each factorial to see if terms cancel out.\n2. **Simplify Using Factorial Properties**: Use the relationship between factorials, especially how \\((N+1)! = (N+1) \\times N!\\), to simplify the expression.\n3. **Algebraic Manipulation**: Look for common factors in the numerator and denominator that can be canceled.\n\nLet's start by **expanding the factorials** to see if that leads to a simplification.\n\n## **Step 1: Expanding Factorials**\n\nExpanding \\((N-1)!\\) and \\((N+1)!\\):\n\n\\[\n(N-1)! = 1 \\times 2 \\times \\ldots \\times (N-1)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(N+1)! = (N+1) \\times N \\times (N-1) \\times \\ldots \\times 2 \\times 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(N-1)! \\times N}{(N+1) \\times N \\times (N-1)!}\n\\]\n\nWait a moment. I notice that \\((N-1)!\\) appears in both the numerator and the denominator. Maybe there's a better way to handle this without expanding everything.\n\n## **Reflection**\n\nThis approach seems a bit messy because expanding factorials fully is cumbersome, and it's clear that \\((N-1)!\\) cancels out. Perhaps there's a more straightforward method using the properties of factorials.\n\n## **Reevaluating Strategy**\n\nGiven that expanding the factorials leads to cancellation, maybe I should consider **simplifying using factorial properties** right from the start to avoid unnecessary work.\n\n## **Step 2: Simplifying Using Factorial Properties**\n\nRecall that:\n\n\\[\n(N+1)! = (N+1) \\times N!\n\\]\n\nAnd also:\n\n\\[\nN! = N \\times (N-1)!\n\\]\n\nSo, substituting \\(N! = N \\times (N-1)!\\) into \\((N+1)! = (N+1) \\times N!\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n(N+1)! = (N+1) \\times N \\times (N-1)!\n\\]\n\nNow, the original expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(N-1)! \\times N}{(N+1) \\times N \\times (N-1)!}\n\\]\n\nAh, I see that \\((N-1)!\\) cancels out:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N}{(N+1) \\times N} = \\frac{1}{N+1}\n\\]\n\n## **Check: Is This Correct?**\n\nLet's quickly verify this result. \n\nIf the expression simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{N+1}\\), that seems reasonable because all the \\(N\\) terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving a simple fraction.\n\nI can also think about a quick sanity check: For example, if \\(N = 2\\),\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(2-1)! \\times 2}{(2+1)!} = \\frac{1 \\times 2}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, using our simplified expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2 + 1} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nBoth approaches yield the same result, so the simplification seems correct.\n\n## **Step 3: Alternative Method - Algebraic Manipulation**\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider another approach:\n\nSuppose instead of simplifying directly, I try to factor out common terms step by step.\n\nStarting with the original expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(N-1)! \\times N}{(N+1)!}\n\\]\n\nWe know that:\n\n\\[\n(N+1)! = (N+1) \\times N \\times (N-1)!\n\\]\n\nSo, substitute this back:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(N-1)! \\times N}{(N+1) \\times N \\times (N-1)!}\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\((N-1)!\\) cancels out, leading to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N}{(N+1) \\times N} = \\frac{1}{N+1}\n\\]\n\nHmm, this seems redundant because it's leading back to the same simplification we did earlier. However, it's good to double-check using a different method to confirm the result.\n\n## **Final Check**\n\nBefore concluding, let's reflect one more time:\n\n- Both methods (direct simplification and alternative method) lead to the same result: \\(\\frac{1}{N+1}\\).\n- A quick check with a specific value of \\(N\\) (e.g., \\(N = 2\\)) confirms the correctness.\n- The steps make sense logically, with factorials canceling appropriately.\n\nGiven all these checks, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThrough brainstorming and trying different strategies, I found that simplifying the expression using factorial properties was the most efficient approach. Here's the final answer:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(N-1)!(N)}{(N+1)!} = \\frac{1}{N+1}\n\\]\n\nBy reflecting and checking each step, I ensured the correctness of the solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Since $N!=(N-1)!(N)$, we can rewrite the given fraction as $\\frac{N!}{(N+1)!}$. We can rewrite the denominator as $(N+1)!=(N!)(N+1)$, so the fraction becomes $\\frac{N!}{(N!)(N+1)}$. Canceling an $N!$ from the numerator and denominator, we are left with $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{N+1}}$."
