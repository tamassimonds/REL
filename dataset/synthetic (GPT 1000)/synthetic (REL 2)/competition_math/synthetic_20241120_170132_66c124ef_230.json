    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem: Compute \\( (-64) \\div (-32) \\).\n\n### **First Thoughts**\nWhen I first see this problem, a couple of things come to mind:\n\n1. **Basic Division**: This seems like a straightforward division problem involving negative numbers. I remember from my earlier experiences that dividing negative numbers often results in a positive quotient because two negatives cancel each other out.\n\n2. **Signs Matter**: I'm recalling the rule that dividing two numbers with the same sign (both negative or both positive) yields a positive result. Similarly, dividing numbers with opposite signs results in a negative result.\n\n3. **Checking with Examples**: To make sure, I think it might help to recall a similar problem or maybe even try a smaller example to see if my initial thought holds true.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n- **Direct Calculation**: Just perform the division as if both numbers were positive, keeping in mind that both negatives would make the result positive.\n  \n- **Utilizing the Rule of Signs**: Apply the rule that dividing two negatives results in a positive number.\n  \n- **Visualizing with Smaller Numbers**: Perhaps use smaller negative numbers to see if the pattern holds.\n\n### **Exploring the Direct Calculation Strategy**\n\nLet's try the direct approach:\n\n\\[\n(-64) \\div (-32)\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process**: \n- Since both numbers are negative, I expect the result to be positive.\n- But let's work it out step by step to ensure I'm correct.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Magnitude: } 64 \\div 32 = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Sign: Both are negative } \\Rightarrow \\text{ Result is positive.}\n\\]\n\nSo, intuitively, I think:\n\n\\[\n(-64) \\div (-32) = 2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection**: \n- This feels right because dividing two negatives should indeed give a positive.\n- But let me double-check by considering another strategy just to be sure.\n\n### **Trying the Rule of Signs Strategy**\n\nTo validate my earlier approach, let's apply the rule of signs:\n\n- **Rule**: If both numbers being divided have the same sign, the result is positive.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Since both } (-64) \\text{ and } (-32) \\text{ are negative: }\n\\]\n\\[\n(-64) \\div (-32) = \\text{Positive result}\n\\]\n\n**Verification**: \n- Again, this aligns with my initial thought.\n- It's reassuring to see that both strategies lead to the same conclusion.\n\n### **Testing with a Smaller Example**\n\nMaybe testing with smaller numbers would reinforce my understanding. Let's take \\( (-6) \\div (-3) \\).\n\n\\[\n(-6) \\div (-3) = 2\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process**: \n- This small example reflects the same pattern as with \\( (-64) \\div (-32) \\).\n- It confirms that my approach is consistent across different scales.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing, let me quickly verify:\n\n- **Calculation**: \n  - Magnitude: \\( 64 \\div 32 = 2 \\)\n  - Both signs negative: Result is positive \\( \\Rightarrow 2 \\)\n\n- **Consistency**: \n  - Both strategies (direct calculation and rule of signs) agree.\n  - The smaller example aligns with the larger problem.\n\n**Reflection**: \n- Everything checks out. The answer makes sense both intuitively and through calculation.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies and verifying with smaller examples, the solution to the problem is:\n\n\\[\n(-64) \\div (-32) = 2\n\\]\n\n**Final Thoughts**: \n- Initially, I was unsure whether to just apply the basic division rule or to integrate the sign rules more explicitly. \n- By reflecting and checking with a smaller example, I confirmed that both approaches lead to the same correct answer.\n- It's always helpful to validate your method, especially with negative numbers, to avoid common mistakes.",
