Therefore, \\( n = 3 \\) is **not** possible.\n\n**Does This Work?**  \n- **No,** \\( n = 3 \\) is **not** a valid possibility because it would force the fourth root to be integer, making \\( n = 4 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>  \nAfter correcting the initial oversight, the possible values of \\( n \\) are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0, 1, 2, 4}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Concluding Reflection**\n\nBy approaching the problem step-by-step and considering different strategies, I've confirmed that a quartic polynomial with integer coefficients can have 0, 1, 2, or 4 integer roots, counting multiplicity. Each valid value was verified through constructing specific polynomials, ensuring the correctness of the solution. Initially, I mistakenly included \\( n = 3 \\), but upon realizing that it would necessitate a fourth integer root, I corrected the error and arrived at the correct set of possible values.\n\n<ANSWER> solution</ANSWER>  \n**Final Answer:** 0, 1, 2, 4\n\n---\n\n### **Summary: Putting It All Together**\n\n1. **Explored Each \\( n \\):** Starting from \\( n = 0 \\) to \\( n = 4 \\).\n2. **Constructed Examples:** For each valid \\( n \\), specific polynomials were created to demonstrate feasibility.\n3. **Identified and Corrected Mistakes:** Initially considered \\( n = 3 \\) possible, but upon deeper analysis using Vieta's formulas, realized it was not feasible.\n4. **Validated Final Answer:** Ensured that all feasible values of \\( n \\) were covered and corrected any initial oversights.\n5. **Final Conclusion:** Only \\( n = 0, 1, 2, 4 \\) are possible, aligning with the properties of quartic polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\n---\n\nBy methodically working through each step, reflecting on the approach, and being open to identifying and correcting mistakes, the solution maintains its integrity and arrives at the correct conclusion.",
