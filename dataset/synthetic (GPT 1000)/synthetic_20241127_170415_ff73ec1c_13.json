  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were tackling it on paper, complete with brainstorming, checking for correctness, and adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, we have six congruent circles forming a ring, each tangent to its neighbors and all internally tangent to a larger circle \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) with a radius of 30. Our goal is to find the area inside \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) but outside the six smaller circles, and then take the floor of that area.\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Circle Packing:** This reminds me of circle packing problems where smaller circles fit neatly within a larger circle.\n- **Symmetry:** The setup suggests symmetry, which might be useful for calculations.\n- **Geometry Involvement:** I'm thinking geometry will play a big role here, possibly involving tangents and radii.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Radius of the Smaller Circles:**\n   - Knowing their radius would allow me to find their total area and subtract it from \\(\\mathcal{C}\\).\n\n2. **Use Trigonometry:**\n   - Angles could be involved since there are six circles forming a hexagonal pattern.\n\n3. **Examine the Geometry of Tangency:**\n   - Understanding how the circles are tangent to each other and to \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) might help.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n\n- I need to establish a relationship between the radius of the larger circle and the smaller ones.\n- Given the congruence and symmetry, there should be a repeatable geometric pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the First Strategy: Calculating the Radius of the Smaller Circles**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s attempt to determine the radius of the smaller circles first. If I can figure that out, calculating their total area becomes straightforward.\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\n- Each smaller circle is tangent to its neighbors and to the larger circle.\n- This suggests that the distance from the center of the larger circle to the center of a smaller circle is fixed.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a minute,** if all smaller circles are internally tangent to the larger circle, their centers lie on a circle inside \\(\\mathcal{C}\\).\n- **Ah!** This forms a hexagon where each vertex is the center of a smaller circle.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- The distance from the center of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) to any of the smaller circles\u2019 centers is \\(R_{\\text{outer}} - r\\), where \\(R_{\\text{outer}} = 30\\) and \\(r\\) is the radius of the smaller circles.\n\n**Checking Validity:**\n\n- Does this make sense? Yes, because the smaller circles are internally tangent, so their centers are \\(r\\) units away from the circumference of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating the Distance: Using Geometry**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s set up the relationship between the radii.\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\n- The centers of the smaller circles form a regular hexagon.\n- The distance between adjacent centers is \\(2r\\) (since each pair of circles is externally tangent).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This implies that the hexagon\u2019s side length is \\(2r\\).\n- The circumradius of this hexagon (distance from the center of the hexagon to any vertex) is equal to \\(R_{\\text{outer}} - r\\).\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- For a regular hexagon, the circumradius \\(R_{\\text{hex}}\\) is related to the side length \\(s\\) by:\n  \n  \\[\n  R_{\\text{hex}} = s \\times \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}}\n  \\]\n  \n- Setting \\(R_{\\text{outer}} - r = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), we can solve for \\(r\\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n30 - r = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(r\\):**\n\n\\[\n30\\sqrt{3} - r\\sqrt{3} = 2r\n\\]\n\n\\[\n30\\sqrt{3} = r(\\sqrt{3} + 2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{30\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} + 2}\n\\]\n\n**Rationalizing the Denominator:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{30\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} - 2)}{(\\sqrt{3} + 2)(\\sqrt{3} - 2)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{30\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} - 2)}{3 - 4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{30\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} - 2)}{-1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= -30\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} - 2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= -30(3 - 2\\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= -90 + 60\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a minute,** the radius \\(r\\) cannot be negative. This indicates an error in my simplification process.\n\n**Recognizing the Mistake:**\n\n- **Ah, I see!** I mishandled the negative sign during rationalization.\n\n**Correcting the Mistake:**\n\nLet\u2019s simplify differently to avoid ending up with a negative radius.\n\n**Alternative Simplification:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{30\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} + 2}\n\\]\n\nInstead of rationalizing incorrectly, let's break it down step by step:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{30\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} + 2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 2}{\\sqrt{3} - 2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{30\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} - 2)}{(\\sqrt{3} + 2)(\\sqrt{3} - 2)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{30\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} - 2)}{3 - 4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{30\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} - 2)}{-1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= -30\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} - 2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= -30(3 - 2\\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= -90 + 60\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait, this can't be right** because the negative sign indicates an error. Let me rethink the rationalization process.\n\n**Re-examining the Rationalization:**\n\nLet\u2019s handle the rationalization step carefully to avoid negative values.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{30\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} + 2}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt{3} - 2\\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{30\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} - 2)}{(\\sqrt{3} + 2)(\\sqrt{3} - 2)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{30\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} - 2)}{3 - 4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{30\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} - 2)}{-1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= -30\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3} - 2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= -30(3 - 2\\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= -90 + 60\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n**Realizing the Error:**\n\n- The negative sign indicates a misstep. I must have mishandled the signs during rationalization.\n\n**Alternative Simplification:**\n\nInstead of rationalizing, let's approximate numerically to avoid confusion.\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{30\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} + 2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating numerically:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3} + 2 \\approx 3.732\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr \\approx \\frac{30 \\times 1.732}{3.732} \\approx \\frac{51.96}{3.732} \\approx 13.92\n\\]\n\n**Checking the Result:**\n\n- This value makes sense as it's less than the radius of the larger circle.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with the Correct Radius**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that we have \\(r \\approx 13.92\\), we can proceed to calculate the area of the six smaller circles and then find \\(K\\).\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\n- Calculate the area of one smaller circle.\n- Multiply by six to get the total area of all smaller circles.\n- Subtract this total from the area of the larger circle \\(\\mathcal{C}\\).\n- Take the floor of the resulting area.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. **Area of One Smaller Circle:**\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{small}} = \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Total Area of the Six Smaller Circles:**\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{total\\_small}} = 6 \\times A_{\\text{small}} = 6\\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Area of the Larger Circle \\(\\mathcal{C}\\):**\n   \\[\n   A_{\\mathcal{C}} = \\pi R_{\\text{outer}}^2 = \\pi \\times 30^2 = 900\\pi\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Area \\(K\\) Inside \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) but Outside the Six Circles:**\n   \\[\n   K = A_{\\mathcal{C}} - A_{\\text{total\\_small}} = 900\\pi - 6\\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Compute \\(K\\) Numerically and Find \\(\\lfloor K \\rfloor\\):**\n   \\[\n   K \\approx 900\\pi - 6\\pi (13.92)^2\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   = 900\\pi - 6\\pi \\times 193.7664\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   = 900\\pi - 1162.5984\\pi\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   = -262.5984\\pi\n   \\]\n   \n**Checking the Calculation:**\n\n- **Wait, this result doesn't make sense** because \\(K\\) should be positive.\n- I must have made an error in my approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Identifying the Mistake: Re-evaluating the Strategy**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSomething is off because the calculated \\(K\\) is negative, which is impossible for an area.\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\n- Maybe I incorrectly set up the relationship between the radii.\n- Perhaps the assumption about the hexagon's side length needs revisiting.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- Let me revisit the geometric relationship and ensure the calculations align with the problem's constraints.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nInstead of focusing solely on the hexagon, let's consider the entire configuration, including the angles and how the circles fit within \\(\\mathcal{C}\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Second Strategy: Using Central Angles and Trigonometry**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nLet\u2019s think about the angles involved and the positions of the circles within \\(\\mathcal{C}\\).\n\n**Thinking Aloud:**\n\n- There are six smaller circles, so they likely correspond to a hexagonal pattern.\n- Each central angle in the larger circle corresponding to a smaller circle's position is \\(360^\\circ / 6 = 60^\\circ\\).\n- This suggests that the centers of the smaller circles divide the larger circle into six equal parts.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- This symmetry can be helpful in calculating areas and understanding the configuration.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n- Identify the relationship between the radii using central angles and trigonometry.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Draw a Diagram:**\n   - Visualize a central angle of \\(60^\\circ\\) with the larger circle's center.\n   - Locate two smaller circles tangent to each other and internally tangent to \\(\\mathcal{C}\\).\n\n2. **Identify Key Points:**\n   - Let \\(O\\) be the center of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\).\n   - Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be the centers of two adjacent smaller circles.\n   - Let \\(P\\) be the point of tangency between \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) and one of the smaller circles.\n\n3. **Determine Distances:**\n   - \\(OA = OB = 30 - r\\) (distance from \\(\\mathcal{C}\\)\u2019s center to the centers of smaller circles).\n   - \\(AB = 2r\\) (distance between centers of two adjacent smaller circles).\n\n4. **Utilize the Law of Cosines:**\n   \\[\n   AB^2 = OA^2 + OB^2 - 2 \\times OA \\times OB \\times \\cos(60^\\circ)\n   \\]\n   \n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   (2r)^2 = (30 - r)^2 + (30 - r)^2 - 2 \\times (30 - r) \\times (30 - r) \\times \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   4r^2 = 2(30 - r)^2 - (30 - r)^2\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   4r^2 = (30 - r)^2\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   4r^2 = (900 - 60r + r^2)\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   4r^2 = 900 - 60r + r^2\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   3r^2 + 60r - 900 = 0\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   r^2 + 20r -

  "ground_truth": "Let $r$ be the radius of each of the six congruent circles, and let $A$ and $B$ be the centers of two adjacent circles. Join the centers of adjacent circles to form a regular hexagon with side $2r$.  Let $O$ be the center of $\\cal C$.  Draw the radii of $\\cal C$ that contain $A$ and $B$. Triangle $ABO$ is equilateral, so $OA=OB=2r$.  Because each of the two radii contains the point where the smaller circle is tangent to $\\cal\nC$, the radius of $\\cal C$ is $3r$, and $K=\\pi\\left((3r)^2-6r^2\\right)=3\\pi r^2$. The radius of $\\cal C$ is 30, so $r=10$, $K=300\\pi$, and $\\lfloor K\\rfloor=\\boxed{942}$."
