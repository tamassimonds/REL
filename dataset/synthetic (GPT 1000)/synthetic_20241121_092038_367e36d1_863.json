  "solution": "To find the area of an isosceles trapezoid circumscribed around a circle, we start by denoting the longer base as \\( b_1 = 16 \\) and the shorter base as \\( b_2 \\). For such trapezoids, the following relationship holds:\n\n\\[\nb_1 + b_2 = 2a\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is the length of each leg of the trapezoid.\n\nWe are given that one of the base angles is \\( \\theta = \\arcsin(0.8) \\). From this, we can calculate the cosine of the angle:\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\theta = 0.8 \\implies \\cos \\theta = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 \\theta} = \\sqrt{0.36} = 0.6\n\\]\n\nThe height \\( h \\) of the trapezoid can be expressed in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( \\theta \\) as:\n\n\\[\nh = a \\sin(\\theta) = a \\cdot 0.8\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the horizontal distance contributed by each leg to the bases:\n\n\\[\nx = a \\cos(\\theta) = a \\cdot 0.6\n\\]\n\nThus, we also have the relationship:\n\n\\[\nb_1 - b_2 = 2x = 2(a \\cdot 0.6) = 1.2a\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( b_1 + b_2 = 2a \\) \n2. \\( b_1 - b_2 = 1.2a \\) \n\nWe can solve these equations by adding them:\n\n\\[\n(b_1 + b_2) + (b_1 - b_2) = 2a + 1.2a \\implies 2b_1 = 3.2a \\implies b_1 = 1.6a\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( b_1 = 16 \\) into this equation gives:\n\n\\[\n16 = 1.6a \\implies a = \\frac{16}{1.6} = 10\n\\]\n\nWith \\( a \\) determined, we can find \\( b_2 \\):\n\nUsing equation (1):\n\n\\[\n16 + b_2 = 2 \\times 10 \\implies 16 + b_2 = 20 \\implies b_2 = 4\n\\]\n\nNow we have both bases: \\( b_1 = 16 \\) and \\( b_2 = 4 \\).\n\nNext, we calculate the height \\( h \\):\n\n\\[\nh = a \\sin(\\theta) = 10 \\cdot 0.8 = 8\n\\]\n\nFinally, we apply the area formula for trapezoids:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) h = \\frac{1}{2} (16 + 4) \\cdot 8 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 20 \\cdot 8 = 80\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the trapezoid is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{80}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let the trapezium have diagonal legs of length $x$ and a shorter base of length $y$. Drop altitudes from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base to form two right-angled triangles, which are congruent since the trapezium is isosceles. Thus using the base angle of $\\arcsin(0.8)$ gives the vertical side of these triangles as $0.8x$ and the horizontal side as $0.6x$. Now notice that the sides of the trapezium can be seen as being made up of tangents to the circle, and thus using the fact that \"the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length\" gives $2y + 0.6x + 0.6x = 2x$. Also, using the given length of the longer base tells us that $y + 0.6x + 0.6x = 16$. Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x=10$ and $y=4$, so the height of the trapezium is $0.8 \\times 10 = 8$. Thus the area is $\\frac{1}{2}(4+16)(8) = \\boxed{80}$."
