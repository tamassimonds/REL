  "problem": "Mark borrows $10$ dollars from Emily with a simple interest rate of $15\\%$ everyday. What is the least integer number of days after which Mark will have to pay her back at least twice as much as he borrowed?",
  "solution": "To find out the least number of days after which Mark must repay at least double the amount he borrowed from Emily, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Problem Overview**: \n   - Mark borrows $10 from Emily.\n   - He must repay a minimum of $20, which is double the borrowed amount.\n   - The interest rate is 15% per day.\n\n2. **Calculate Daily Interest**: \n   - The daily interest can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Interest per day} = \\text{Principal} \\times \\text{Interest rate} = 10 \\times 0.15 = 1.50.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Amount After \\( d \\) Days**:\n   - The total amount Mark needs to repay after \\( d \\) days includes the principal and the interest accrued:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Amount} = \\text{Principal} + \\text{Interest} = 10 + 1.50d.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Set Up the Inequality**:\n   - We want the total amount to be at least $20:\n     \\[\n     10 + 1.50d \\geq 20.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( d \\)**:\n   - Subtract 10 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     1.50d \\geq 10.\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 1.50:\n     \\[\n     d \\geq \\frac{10}{1.50} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67.\n     \\]\n\n6. **Determine the Smallest Integer**:\n   - Since \\( d \\) must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us:\n     \\[\n     d = 7.\n     \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Thus, the least integer number of days after which Mark will need to pay back at least double the amount he borrowed from Emily is \\( 7 \\).\n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>7 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since the interest rate is simple, he has to pay an interest of $10 \\cdot 0.15 =1.5$ dollars every day.\n\nLet $x$ be the number of days needed to repay at least double the amount borrowed. Since he has to repay $10 as well as $\\$1.5x$ in interest, we have the inequality $10+1.5x \\ge 10 \\cdot 2$. Solving for $x$, we get $x \\ge 6.\\overline{6}$. The smallest integer greater than $6.\\overline{6}$ is $7$. Therefore, it would take at least $\\boxed{7 \\text{ days}}$."
