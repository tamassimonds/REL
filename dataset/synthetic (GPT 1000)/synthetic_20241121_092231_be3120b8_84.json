  "problem": "Forty teams play a tournament in which every team plays every other team exactly once. No ties occur, and each team has a $50 \\%$ chance of winning any game it plays. The probability that no two teams win the same number of games is $\\frac mn,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $\\log_2 n.$\n",
  "solution": "To determine the probability that no two teams in a tournament of 40 teams have the same number of wins, we can follow these systematic steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Number of Games\nIn this tournament, each team will play every other team exactly once. The number of games played can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\text{Total games} = \\binom{40}{2} = \\frac{40 \\times 39}{2} = 780.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine Total Number of Outcomes\nEach game has 2 possible outcomes (either team can win), leading to a total number of possible outcomes for the tournament:\n\\[\n\\text{Total outcomes} = 2^{780}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Distinct Win Totals\nFor each team, the number of wins can range from 0 to 39. To ensure that no two teams have the same win tally, the win totals must be a unique permutation of the numbers 0 through 39. The number of different ways to assign these unique win totals to the 40 teams is:\n\\[\n\\text{Distinct assignments} = 40!.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Probability\nThe probability \\( P \\) that no two teams win the same number of games is then given by the ratio of favorable outcomes (distinct win totals) to total outcomes:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{40!}{2^{780}}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplify the Probability\nTo express \\( P \\) in the form \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), we identify \\( n \\). We note that \\( 2^{780} \\) is a power of 2, while \\( 40! \\) needs to be examined for factors of 2 to simplify:\n\n### Step 6: Count the Power of 2 in \\( 40! \\)\nUsing Legendre's formula, we find the highest power of 2 that divides \\( 40! \\):\n\\[\n\\text{Power of } 2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{8} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{16} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{32} \\right\\rfloor.\n\\]\nCalculating each term, we have:\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 20, \\quad \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 10, \\quad \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{8} \\right\\rfloor = 5, \\quad \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{16} \\right\\rfloor = 2, \\quad \\left\\lfloor \\frac{40}{32} \\right\\rfloor = 1.\n\\]\nSumming these provides:\n\\[\n\\text{Total power of 2 in } 40! = 20 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 38.\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Determine \\( n \\)\nHence, \\( 40! \\) contains \\( 2^{38} \\), leading us to:\n\\[\n\\frac{40!}{2^{780}} = \\frac{40! / 2^{38}}{2^{742}}.\n\\]\nHere, \\( 40! / 2^{38} \\) is an odd integer. Thus, we can conclude that:\n\\[\nn = 2^{742}.\n\\]\n\nThe logarithm base 2 of \\( n \\) is:\n\\[\n\\log_2 n = 742.\n\\]\n\nConsequently, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{742}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "There are ${40 \\choose 2} = 780$ total pairings of teams, and thus $2^{780}$ possible outcomes. In order for no two teams to win the same number of games, they must each win a different number of games. Since the minimum and maximum possible number of games won are 0 and 39 respectively, and there are 40 teams in total, each team corresponds uniquely with some $k$, with $0 \\leq k \\leq 39$, where $k$ represents the number of games the team won. With this in mind, we see that there are a total of $40!$ outcomes in which no two teams win the same number of games. Further, note that these are all the valid combinations, as the team with 1 win must beat the team with 0 wins, the team with 2 wins must beat the teams with 1 and 0 wins, and so on; thus, this uniquely defines a combination.\nThe desired probability is thus $\\frac{40!}{2^{780}}$. We wish to simplify this into the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime. The only necessary step is to factor out all the powers of 2 from $40!$; the remaining number is clearly relatively prime to all powers of 2.\nThe number of powers of 2 in $40!$ is $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{2} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{4} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{8} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{16} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{40}{32} \\right \\rfloor = 20 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 38.$\n$780-38 = \\boxed{742}$."
