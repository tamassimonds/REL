  "problem": "A standard deck of cards has 52 cards divided into 4 suits, each of which has 13 cards.  Two of the suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$, called 'hearts' and 'diamonds') are red, the other two ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$, called 'spades' and 'clubs') are black.  The cards in the deck are placed in random order (usually by a process called 'shuffling').  In how many ways can we pick two different cards? (Order matters, thus ace of spades followed by jack of diamonds is different than jack of diamonds followed by ace of spades.)",
  "solution": "To determine the number of ways to pick two different cards from a standard deck of 52 cards while considering the order of selection, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Consider the Order**: Since the order in which the cards are picked matters (e.g., picking the Ace of Spades first and the Jack of Diamonds second is different from picking them in the reverse order), we need to account for this in our calculations.\n\n2. **Choosing the First Card**: When selecting the first card, there are 52 options available.\n\n3. **Choosing the Second Card**: After selecting the first card, only 51 cards remain for the second pick, as it must differ from the first card chosen.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Combinations**: The total number of ways to choose two different cards, taking into account the order, is obtained by multiplying the number of choices for the first card by the number of choices for the second card:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total combinations} = 52 \\times 51\n   \\]\n\n5. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   52 \\times 51 = 2652\n   \\]\n\nThus, the total number of ways to pick two different cards from a standard deck, considering the order of selection, is \n\n<ANSWER>2652</ANSWER>.",
  "ground_truth": "For the total number of possibilities, there are 52 ways to pick the first card, then 51 ways to pick the second card, for a total of $52 \\times 51 =\\boxed{2652}$ total possibilities."
