  "problem": "Kimberly borrows $1000$ dollars from Lucy, who charged interest of $5\\%$ per month (which compounds monthly). What is the least integer number of months after which Kimberly will owe more than twice as much as she borrowed?",
  "solution": "To determine the minimum number of months after which Kimberly will owe more than double the amount she borrowed, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Loan Details**:\n   - Kimberly borrows $1000.\n   - The monthly interest rate is 5% (or 0.05 in decimal form).\n\n2. **Compounding Interest Formula**:\n   The total amount owed after \\( n \\) months can be expressed using the compounding interest formula:\n   \\[\n   A = P(1 + r)^n\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( A \\) is the total amount owed,\n   - \\( P \\) is the principal amount ($1000),\n   - \\( r \\) is the monthly interest rate (0.05),\n   - \\( n \\) is the number of months.\n   \n   Substituting in the known values:\n   \\[\n   A = 1000(1.05)^n\n   \\]\n\n3. **Setting the Condition**:\n   Kimberly will owe more than twice the borrowed amount ($2000) when:\n   \\[\n   A > 2000\n   \\]\n   This leads to:\n   \\[\n   1000(1.05)^n > 2000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplifying the Inequality**:\n   By dividing both sides by 1000, we get:\n   \\[\n   (1.05)^n > 2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solving for \\( n \\)**:\n   To isolate \\( n \\), we take the logarithm of both sides:\n   \\[\n   n \\log(1.05) > \\log(2)\n   \\]\n   Rearranging this gives us:\n   \\[\n   n > \\frac{\\log(2)}{\\log(1.05)}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculating Logarithms**:\n   Using approximate values for the logarithms:\n   - \\( \\log(2) \\approx 0.3010 \\)\n   - \\( \\log(1.05) \\approx 0.0212 \\)\n   \n   We substitute these values into our inequality:\n   \\[\n   n > \\frac{0.3010}{0.0212} \\approx 14.1887\n   \\]\n\n7. **Finding the Least Integer**:\n   Since \\( n \\) must be an integer, we round \\( 14.1887 \\) up to the next whole number:\n   \\[\n   n = 15\n   \\]\n\nThus, the least integer number of months after which Kimberly will owe more than twice the amount she borrowed is:\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: } 15\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Since the amount Kimberly owes is multiplied by 1.05 each month, we want the least integer $t$ for which $1.05^t>2$. Trying some integer values of $t$, we find that $\\boxed{15}$ is the smallest that satisfies this condition."
