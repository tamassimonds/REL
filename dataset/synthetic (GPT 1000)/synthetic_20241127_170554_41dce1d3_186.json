  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would naturally\u2014brainstorming, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my approach as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, the question is asking for three-digit positive integers where the sum of the digits equals 5. At first glance, this reminds me of problems involving digit sums and possibly using combinatorics to count the possibilities. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure of the best approach right off the bat, so I'll brainstorm a few strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Brute Force Listing:**  \n   - Maybe I can list out all the three-digit numbers and check which ones have a digit sum of 5.  \n   - **Initial Reaction:** This seems tedious since there are 900 three-digit numbers (100 to 999). Probably not efficient.\n\n2. **Combinatorial Approach:**  \n   - Using combinations to find all sets of digits that add up to 5.  \n   - **Initial Reaction:** This could work by treating the problem like distributing the sum across digits.\n\n3. **Using Generating Functions:**  \n   - I've heard of generating functions being used for digit sum problems.  \n   - **Initial Reaction:** This might be overkill for a three-digit problem, and I'm not entirely comfortable with it.\n\n4. **Recursive Thinking:**  \n   - Maybe think about how many ways to split 5 into three parts that fit as digits.  \n   - **Initial Reaction:** Sounds similar to the combinatorial approach but framed differently.\n\n**Decision:** I think I\u2019ll start with the **Combinatorial Approach** since it seems like a balanced path\u2014more efficient than brute force but not as complex as generating functions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Combinatorial Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- I want to find all combinations of three digits (hundreds, tens, units) that add up to 5.  \n- Each digit can range from 0 to 9, but since it's a three-digit number, the hundreds digit must be at least 1.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- Wait a minute, if the hundreds digit must be at least 1, I need to account for that in my sum. So, I'll adjust the problem to consider that the hundreds digit is at least 1.\n\n**Adjustment:**  \n- Let\u2019s set the hundreds digit \\( H = h + 1 \\), where \\( h \\geq 0 \\).  \n- Now, the problem becomes finding \\( h + T + U = 4 \\) (since \\( H = h + 1 \\) and \\( H + T + U = 5 \\)).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- This adjustment maintains the sum at 5 while ensuring the hundreds digit is at least 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Setting Up the Equation**\n\n**Equation:**  \n- \\( h + T + U = 4 \\)  \n- Where:  \n  - \\( h \\geq 0 \\)  \n  - \\( T \\geq 0 \\)  \n  - \\( U \\geq 0 \\)  \n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- This looks like a classic combinatorics problem where I need to find non-negative integer solutions to the equation.  \n- I can use the \u201cstars and bars\u201d method to solve this.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- The stars and bars method is a good fit here because it allows me to calculate the number of ways to distribute a sum across multiple variables.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Stars and Bars Method**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- The formula for the number of non-negative solutions is:  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}\n  \\]  \n  Where \\( n \\) is the total sum, and \\( k \\) is the number of variables.\n\n**Applying to Our Problem:**  \n- Here, \\( n = 4 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\) (for \\( h, T, U \\)).  \n- So, the number of solutions is:  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{4+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{6}{2} = 15\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Wait, is this correct?** Let me think\u2014this calculation assumes all digits can be zero, but in a three-digit number, the hundreds digit can't be zero.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Oops!** I need to adjust for cases where the hundreds digit is zero, which isn't allowed. So, some of these 15 solutions might be invalid.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Identifying and Removing Invalid Cases**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- I need to ensure that \\( h \\geq 1 \\) (since \\( H = h + 1 \\)), which means I should subtract cases where \\( h = 0 \\).\n\n**Calculating Invalid Cases:**  \n- Set \\( h = 0 \\), so \\( T + U = 4 \\).  \n- Number of solutions for \\( T + U = 4 \\) is:  \n  \\[\n  \\binom{4+2-1}{2-1} = \\binom{5}{1} = 5\n  \\]  \n- These are the cases where the hundreds digit would be zero, which aren't valid for three-digit numbers.\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Great!** By subtracting these invalid cases, I can ensure that all remaining solutions are valid three-digit numbers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Total valid solutions = Total solutions - Invalid solutions  \n  \\[\n  15 - 5 = 10\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Before finalizing, let me list out the valid combinations to see if they make sense.\n\n**Listing Valid Combinations:**  \n1. \\( H = 1, T = 0, U = 4 \\) \u21d2 104  \n2. \\( H = 1, T = 1, U = 3 \\) \u21d2 113  \n3. \\( H = 1, T = 2, U = 2 \\) \u21d2 122  \n4. \\( H = 1, T = 3, U = 1 \\) \u21d2 131  \n5. \\( H = 1, T = 4, U = 0 \\) \u21d2 140  \n6. \\( H = 2, T = 0, U = 3 \\) \u21d2 203  \n7. \\( H = 2, T = 1, U = 2 \\) \u21d2 212  \n8. \\( H = 2, T = 2, U = 1 \\) \u21d2 221  \n9. \\( H = 2, T = 3, U = 0 \\) \u21d2 230  \n10. \\( H = 3, T = 0, U = 2 \\) \u21d2 302  \n11. \\( H = 3, T = 1, U = 1 \\) \u21d2 311  \n12. \\( H = 3, T = 2, U = 0 \\) \u21d2 320  \n13. \\( H = 4, T = 0, U = 1 \\) \u21d2 401  \n14. \\( H = 4, T = 1, U = 0 \\) \u21d2 410  \n15. \\( H = 5, T = 0, U = 0 \\) \u21d2 500  \n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Hold on!** I initially subtracted 5 invalid cases, but listing them out shows there are actually more valid cases than I accounted for.\n\n**Adjusting Calculation:**  \n- It seems that subtracting only 5 invalid cases was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Re-examining the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Maybe my initial subtraction was too simplistic. I need to ensure I'm only counting valid three-digit numbers.\n\n**New Strategy:**  \n- Instead of subtracting invalid cases, let's directly count the valid cases by ensuring the hundreds digit is always at least 1.\n\n**Applying the New Approach:**  \n- For \\( H = 1 \\): \\( T + U = 4 \\)  \n  - Solutions: \\( (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0) \\) \u21d2 5 cases  \n- For \\( H = 2 \\): \\( T + U = 3 \\)  \n  - Solutions: \\( (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0) \\) \u21d2 4 cases  \n- For \\( H = 3 \\): \\( T + U = 2 \\)  \n  - Solutions: \\( (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) \\) \u21d2 3 cases  \n- For \\( H = 4 \\): \\( T + U = 1 \\)  \n  - Solutions: \\( (0,1), (1,0) \\) \u21d2 2 cases  \n- For \\( H = 5 \\): \\( T + U = 0 \\)  \n  - Solution: \\( (0,0) \\) \u21d2 1 case  \n\n**Total Valid Cases:**  \n\\[\n5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \n- **Ah, I see!** Initially, I underestimated the number of valid cases by incorrectly subtracting invalid ones. Counting directly per hundreds digit gives me the correct total.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \n- Let's list all 15 valid three-digit numbers to confirm.\n\n**Listing Valid Numbers:**  \n1. 104  \n2. 113  \n3. 122  \n4. 131  \n5. 140  \n6. 203  \n7. 212  \n8. 221  \n9. 230  \n10. 302  \n11. 311  \n12. 320  \n13. 401  \n14. 410  \n15. 500  \n\n**Checking the Sum of Digits:**  \n- Each number's digits add up to 5.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Perfect!** All listed numbers are valid three-digit integers with a digit sum of 5.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(\\boxed{15}\\)  \nThere are 15 three-digit positive integers where the sum of the digits equals 5.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection on the Process**\n\n- **Initial Brainstorming:** Starting with multiple strategies helped me choose the most efficient path but still required adjustments.  \n- **First Mistake:** By incorrectly subtracting invalid cases, I initially underestimated the total.  \n- **Re-examining Approach:** Realizing the mistake prompted me to re-evaluate and adopt a more direct counting method.  \n- **Final Verification:** Listing all valid numbers ensured the correctness of the solution.  \n- **Learning:** It's essential to verify each step, especially when dealing with combinatorial problems, to avoid miscounts.\n\n---\n\nI hope this detailed walkthrough provides a clear understanding of how to approach and solve the problem step by step, reflecting a natural human problem-solving process.",
