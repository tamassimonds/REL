  "solution": "Absolutely, let's put everything together into a polished, coherent solution while retaining the essence of the original thought process. Here's how it might look:\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to determine all real values of \\(b\\) such that the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + bx + 9\\) has two non-real roots.\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n- This problem reminds me of the **discriminant** in quadratic equations. \n- Non-real roots usually occur when the discriminant is negative.\n- Let's explore multiple strategies to ensure we cover all bases:\n\n  1. **Discriminant Approach**\n  2. **Graphical Interpretation**\n  3. **Completing the Square**\n  4. **Using the Quadratic Formula**\n\nGiven my familiarity, I'll start with the **discriminant method** as it's straightforward for determining the nature of the roots.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Discriminant Approach**\n\nFor any quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the discriminant (\\(\\Delta\\)) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\n**Applying to Our Equation:**\n- Here, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = b\\), and \\(c = 9\\).\n- Plugging these values into the discriminant formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4(1)(9) = b^2 - 36\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To have **two non-real roots**, the discriminant must be **negative**:\n\n\\[\nb^2 - 36 < 0\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- This inequality suggests that \\(b^2\\) must be less than 36. It seems correct, but let's proceed to solve it to be sure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Solving the Inequality \\(b^2 - 36 < 0\\)**\n\nLet's find the values of \\(b\\) that satisfy this inequality.\n\n**Rearranging the Inequality:**\n\n\\[\nb^2 < 36\n\\]\n\n**Taking Square Roots:**\n- Remember, taking the square root of both sides introduces **both positive and negative solutions**:\n\n\\[\n-\\sqrt{36} < b < \\sqrt{36} \\implies -6 < b < 6\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This means \\(b\\) must lie strictly between \\(-6\\) and \\(6\\) to ensure the discriminant is negative.\n- **Important Note:** If \\(b = 6\\) or \\(b = -6\\), the discriminant becomes zero, leading to a **double real root**. Since we need **two non-real roots**, \\(b\\) must **exclude** the endpoints.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\nBefore finalizing, it's essential to **verify** that this range of \\(b\\) indeed results in two non-real roots.\n\n**Test Case 1:** Let\u2019s pick \\(b = 0\\) (within \\(-6, 6\\)).\n\n- **Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = 0^2 - 36 = -36\n\\]\n\n- **Result:** The discriminant is negative, so the roots are **non-real**. This aligns with our solution.\n\n**Test Case 2:** Now, let's pick \\(b = 7\\) (outside \\(-6, 6\\)).\n\n- **Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = 7^2 - 36 = 49 - 36 = 13\n\\]\n\n- **Result:** The discriminant is positive, so the roots are **real**. This confirms that our solution is correct.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Both test cases support that \\(b^2 < 36\\) correctly identifies the range where the roots are non-real.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Step: Expressing the Solution in Interval Notation**\n\nBased on our findings, the real values of \\(b\\) that result in two non-real roots are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-6, 6)}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy applying the discriminant approach and verifying with test cases, we've determined that all real values of \\(b\\) within the interval \\((-6, 6)\\) will make the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + bx + 9\\) have two non-real roots.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-6, 6)}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThis structured approach ensures that we thoroughly understand and verify each step, leading us confidently to the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "Consider the quadratic formula $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. In order for the quadratic to have two non-real roots, the expression under the square root (the discriminant) must be negative. This gives us the inequality \\begin{align*} b^2-4ac&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad b^2-4(1)(9)&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad b^2-36&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (b+6)(b-6)&<0.\n\\end{align*} Thus, we find that $ b\\in\\boxed{(-6, 6)} $."
