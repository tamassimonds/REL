  "problem": "A scalene triangle has side lengths which are prime numbers and the  length of its perimeter is also prime. What is its smallest possible  perimeter?",
  "solution": "To find the smallest possible perimeter of a scalene triangle with side lengths that are prime numbers and whose perimeter is also prime, we can follow a systematic approach:\n\n### Step 1: Definition of a Scalene Triangle\nA scalene triangle has side lengths that are all different. Thus, the sides must be distinct prime numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Small Prime Numbers\nThe initial prime numbers we can use for the sides are:\n- 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.\n\n### Step 3: Select Sets of Three Different Primes\nWe will evaluate combinations of three different primes while ensuring they satisfy the triangle inequality, which requires:\n1. a + b > c\n2. a + c > b\n3. b + c > a\n\n**Testing combinations:**\n\n- **Combination 1:** (3, 5, 7)\n  - Perimeter = 15 (not prime)\n\n- **Combination 2:** (3, 5, 11)\n  - Perimeter = 19 (prime)\n  - Check inequalities: 3 + 5 = 8 (not > 11)\n\n- **Combination 3:** (3, 7, 11)\n  - Perimeter = 21 (not prime)\n\n- **Combination 4:** (5, 7, 11)\n  - Perimeter = 23 (prime)\n  - Check inequalities:\n    - 5 + 7 > 11 (true)\n    - 5 + 11 > 7 (true)\n    - 7 + 11 > 5 (true)\n  - This combination is valid.\n\n### Step 4: Test Larger Combinations\nContinuing with larger primes:\n\n- **Combination 5:** (3, 7, 13)\n  - Perimeter = 23 (prime)\n  - Check inequalities: 3 + 7 = 10 (not > 13)\n\n- **Combination 6:** (5, 11, 13)\n  - Perimeter = 29 (prime)\n  - Check inequalities:\n    - 5 + 11 > 13 (true)\n    - 5 + 13 > 11 (true)\n    - 11 + 13 > 5 (true)\n  - This combination is also valid.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter comparing the valid combinations, we find:\n- The perimeter of (5, 7, 11) is 23.\n- The perimeter of (5, 11, 13) is 29.\n\nTherefore, the smallest valid perimeter of a scalene triangle where all sides and the perimeter are prime is 23.\n\n<ANSWER>23 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The first few prime numbers are: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,\\ldots$.  Since the triangle is scalene, all the sides are different primes.\n\nIf one side is 2, then the other two sides must be odd.  Then the perimeter of the triangle would be even.  But the perimeter must also be greater than 2, so it cannot be prime.  This means that none of the sides can be 2.\n\nNow, suppose one side is 3.  Let the other two sides be $p$ and $q,$ where $p < q.$  Since all the sides are different,\n\\[3 < p < q.\\]Also, by the Triangle Inequality, $p + 3 > q,$ so\n\\[p > q - 3.\\]Since $p < q,$ the only possible values of $p$ are $q - 2$ and $q - 1.$\n\nSince $p$ is a prime greater than 3, $p$ is odd.  If $p = q - 1,$ then $q = p + 1$ is even, which means $q$ is not prime.  Therefore, $p = q - 2,$ or\n\\[q = p + 2.\\]As a number, $p$ must be of the form $3k,$ $3k + 1,$ or $3k + 2.$  Since $p$ is prime, $p$ cannot be of the form $3k.$  If $p = 3k + 1,$ then $q = p + 2 = 3k + 3 = 3(k + 1),$ which is not prime.  Therefore, $p = 3k + 2.$  Then $q = p + 2 = 3k + 4,$ and the perimeter of the triangle is\n\\[p + q + 3 = (3k + 2) + (3k + 4) + 3 = 6k + 9 = 3(2k + 3).\\]Since this is divisible by 3, the perimeter cannot be prime.  This tells us that none of the sides can be equal to 3 either.\n\nNote that $5 + 7 + 11 = 23$ is prime, so the smallest possible perimeter is $\\boxed{23}.$"
