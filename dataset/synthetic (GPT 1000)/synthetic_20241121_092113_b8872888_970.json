  "problem": "Two concentric circles with radii of 19 and 29 units bound a shaded region. A third circle will be drawn with area equal to that of the shaded area. What must the radius of the third circle be? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\n[asy]\nfilldraw(circle((0,0),29),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((0,0),19),white);\n\ndot((0,0));\n\ndraw((0,0)--19dir(45),linewidth(1));\n\nlabel(\"19\",9.5dir(45),NW);\n[/asy]",
  "solution": "To determine the radius of a third circle whose area is equal to the shaded region between two concentric circles, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle**:\n   - The radius of the larger circle is 29 units.\n   - The area is calculated using the formula \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\):\n     \\[\n     A_{\\text{large}} = \\pi (29)^2 = 841\\pi\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the area of the smaller circle**:\n   - The radius of the smaller circle is 19 units.\n   - Using the same area formula:\n     \\[\n     A_{\\text{small}} = \\pi (19)^2 = 361\\pi\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the area of the shaded region**:\n   - The shaded area is the difference between the areas of the larger and smaller circles:\n     \\[\n     A_{\\text{shaded}} = A_{\\text{large}} - A_{\\text{small}} = 841\\pi - 361\\pi = 480\\pi\n     \\]\n\n4. **Equate the area of the third circle to the shaded area**:\n   - Let \\( r \\) be the radius of the third circle. Its area can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\pi r^2\n     \\]\n   - We set this equal to the shaded area:\n     \\[\n     \\pi r^2 = 480\\pi\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( r^2 \\)**:\n   - Cancel \\( \\pi \\) from both sides:\n     \\[\n     r^2 = 480\n     \\]\n\n6. **Find \\( r \\)**:\n   - Taking the square root gives:\n     \\[\n     r = \\sqrt{480}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Simplify \\( \\sqrt{480} \\)**:\n   - Factoring \\( 480 \\):\n     \\[\n     480 = 16 \\times 30\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( 16 = 4^2 \\), we can simplify:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{480} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 30} = \\sqrt{16} \\cdot \\sqrt{30} = 4\\sqrt{30}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the radius of the third circle is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4\\sqrt{30}}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Since the shaded region is everything inside the larger circle but outside the smaller, its area is $29^2 \\pi - 19^2\\pi = 480\\pi$.  So, letting the radius of the third circle be $r$, we have $\\pi r^2 = 480 \\pi$, or $r = \\sqrt{480} = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{30}}$."
