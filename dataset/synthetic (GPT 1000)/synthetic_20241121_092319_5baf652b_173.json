  "problem": "The positive integers $N$ and $N^2$ both end in the same sequence of four digits $abcd$ when written in base $10$, where digit a is not zero. Find the three-digit number $abc$.\n",
  "solution": "To find a positive integer \\( N \\) such that \\( N \\) and \\( N^2 \\) have the same last four digits, we set up the congruence:\n\n\\[\nN^2 \\equiv N \\pmod{10000}.\n\\]\n\nThis leads to:\n\n\\[\nN(N-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10000}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( N \\) and \\( N-1 \\) are consecutive integers, one must be divisible by \\( 16 \\) and the other by \\( 625 \\), given the factorization \\( 10000 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^4 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Case Analysis\n\nWe analyze two cases:\n\n1. **Case 1:** \\( N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16} \\) and \\( N-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{625} \\).\n   - Setting \\( N-1 = 625k \\) gives \\( N = 625k + 1 \\).\n   - Substituting into the modulo \\( 16 \\): \n     \\[\n     625k + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16} \\implies k + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16} \\implies k \\equiv 15 \\pmod{16}.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( k = 16m + 15 \\), leading to:\n     \\[\n     N = 625(16m + 15) + 1 = 10000m + 9376.\n     \\]\n   - This gives \\( N \\equiv 9376 \\pmod{10000} \\).\n\n2. **Case 2:** \\( N \\equiv 0 \\pmod{625} \\) and \\( N-1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16} \\).\n   - Setting \\( N = 625j \\) gives \\( N - 1 = 625j - 1 \\).\n   - This leads to:\n     \\[\n     625j - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16} \\implies j - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16} \\implies j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, \\( j = 16n + 1 \\), which yields:\n     \\[\n     N = 625(16n + 1) = 10000n + 625.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( N \\equiv 625 \\pmod{10000} \\).\n\n### Final Values\n\nFrom our cases, we derive two possible values for \\( N \\):\n- \\( N \\equiv 9376 \\pmod{10000} \\)\n- \\( N \\equiv 625 \\pmod{10000} \\)\n\nSince \\( N \\) must be a positive integer, we consider \\( 9376 \\) (as \\( 625 \\) could be interpreted as \\( 0625 \\)).\n\n### Validation of Results\n\nNow, we validate both candidates:\n\n- **For \\( N = 9376 \\)**:\n  \\[\n  N^2 = 9376^2 = 87909376 \\quad \\text{(last four digits: 9376, match)}.\n  \\]\n\n- **For \\( N = 625 \\)**:\n  \\[\n  N^2 = 625^2 = 390625 \\quad \\text{(last four digits: 0625, match)}.\n  \\]\n\nBoth \\( N \\) values satisfy the condition.\n\n### Final Extraction\n\nThe three-digit number \\( abc \\) from \\( N = 9376 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nabc = 937.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{937}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "We have that $N^2 - N = N(N - 1)\\equiv 0\\mod{10000}$\nThus, $N(N-1)$ must be divisible by both $5^4$ and $2^4$. Note, however, that if either $N$ or $N-1$ has both a $5$ and a $2$ in its factorization, the other must end in either $1$ or $9$, which is impossible for a number that is divisible by either $2$ or $5$. Thus, one of them is divisible by $2^4 = 16$, and the other is divisible by $5^4 = 625$. Noting that $625 \\equiv 1\\mod{16}$, we see that $625$ would work for $N$, except the thousands digit is $0$. The other possibility is that $N$ is a multiple of $16$ and $N-1$ is a multiple of $625$. In order for this to happen,\\[N-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod {16}.\\]Since $625 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, we know that $15 \\cdot 625 = 9375 \\equiv 15 \\equiv -1 \\mod{16}$. Thus, $N-1 = 9375$, so $N = 9376$, and our answer is $\\boxed{937}$."
