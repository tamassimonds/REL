  "problem": "What is the sum of the tens digit and the units digit in the decimal representation of $9^{2004}$?",
  "solution": "To find the sum of the tens and units digits of \\(9^{2004}\\), we need to compute the last two digits of this large number.\n\n1. **Calculate \\(9^{2004} \\mod 100\\)**: The last two digits are obtained by computing \\(9^{2004}\\) modulo 100.\n\n2. **Apply Euler's Theorem**: First, we find \\(\\phi(100)\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is Euler's totient function:\n   \\[\n   100 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\phi(100) = 100 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 40.\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\gcd(9, 100) = 1\\), we can use Euler's theorem, which tells us \\(9^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\).\n\n3. **Reduce the exponent**: We simplify the exponent \\(2004\\) by taking it modulo \\(\\phi(100)\\):\n   \\[\n   2004 \\div 40 = 50.1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2004 = 40 \\times 50 + 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2004 \\mod 40 = 4.\n   \\]\n   Thus, we have \\(9^{2004} \\equiv 9^4 \\mod 100\\).\n\n4. **Compute \\(9^4 \\mod 100\\)**: We first find \\(9^2\\):\n   \\[\n   9^2 = 81.\n   \\]\n   Now, calculate \\(9^4\\):\n   \\[\n   9^4 = (9^2)^2 = 81^2.\n   \\]\n   To find \\(81^2\\):\n   \\[\n   81 \\times 81 = 6561.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \n   \\[\n   9^{2004} \\equiv 6561 \\mod 100,\n   \\]\n   giving us the last two digits \\(61\\).\n\n5. **Extract the tens and units digits**: From \\(61\\), we see the tens digit is \\(6\\) and the units digit is \\(1\\).\n\n6. **Sum the digits**: Finally, we add these digits:\n   \\[\n   6 + 1 = 7.\n   \\]\n\nThe sum of the tens digit and the units digit in the decimal representation of \\(9^{2004}\\) is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).\n\nIn the required format:\n<ANSWER>7</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Write $9$ as $10-1$ and consider raising 9 to the 2004 power by multiplying out the expression \\[\n\\overbrace{(10-1)(10-1)(10-1)\\cdots(10-1)}^{2004\\text{ factors}}\n\\] There will be $2^{2004}$ terms in this expansion (one for each way to choose either 10 or $-1$ for each of the 2004 factors of $(10-1)$), but most of them will not affect the tens or units digit because they will have two or more factors of 10 and therefore will be divisible by 100.  Only the 2004 terms of $-10$ which come from choosing $-1$ in 2003 of the factors and 10 in the remaining one as well as the term $(-1)^{2004}=1$ remain.  Let $N$ represent the sum of all of the terms with more than 1 factor of 10.  We have \\begin{align*}\n(10-1)^{2004}&=N+2004(-10)+1\\\\\n&= N-20,\\!040+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-40+1 \\\\\n&= (N-20,\\!000)-39.\n\\end{align*} So $9^{2004}$ is 39 less than a multiple of 100 and therefore ends in 61.  The sum of 6 and 1 is $\\boxed{7}$."
