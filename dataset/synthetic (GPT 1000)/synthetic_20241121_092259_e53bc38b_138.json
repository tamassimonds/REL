  "problem": "Done with her new problems, Wendy takes a break from math. Still without any fresh reading material, she feels a bit antsy. She starts to feel annoyed that Michael's loose papers clutter the family van. Several of them are ripped, and bits of paper litter the floor. Tired of trying to get Michael to clean up after himself, Wendy spends a couple of minutes putting Michael's loose papers in the trash. \"That seems fair to me,\" confirms Hannah encouragingly.\nWhile collecting Michael's scraps, Wendy comes across a corner of a piece of paper with part of a math problem written on it. There is a monic polynomial of degree $n$, with real coefficients. The first two terms after $x^n$ are $a_{n-1}x^{n-1}$ and $a_{n-2}x^{n-2}$, but the rest of the polynomial is cut off where Michael's page is ripped. Wendy barely makes out a little of Michael's scribbling, showing that $a_{n-1}=-a_{n-2}$. Wendy deciphers the goal of the problem, which is to find the sum of the squares of the roots of the polynomial. Wendy knows neither the value of $n$, nor the value of $a_{n-1}$, but still she finds a [greatest] lower bound for the answer to the problem. Find the absolute value of that lower bound.\n",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we aim to find the sum of the squares of the roots of a monic polynomial of degree \\( n \\) given that \\( a_{n-1} = -a_{n-2} \\).\n\n1. **Polynomial Form**: The polynomial can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   P(x) = x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + a_{n-2} x^{n-2} + \\cdots\n   \\]\n   Since it is monic, the leading coefficient is 1.\n\n2. **Using Given Information**: Given that \\( a_{n-1} = -a_{n-2} \\), we denote \\( a_{n-2} = c \\). Therefore, we can rewrite:\n   \\[\n   a_{n-1} = -c\n   \\]\n   The polynomial now becomes:\n   \\[\n   P(x) = x^n - cx^{n-1} + cx^{n-2} + \\cdots\n   \\]\n\n3. **Applying Vieta's Formulas**: Let the roots be \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n \\). By Vieta's formulas:\n   - The sum of the roots is:\n     \\[\n     r_1 + r_2 + \\ldots + r_n = -a_{n-1} = c\n     \\]\n   - The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is:\n     \\[\n     r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + \\ldots + r_{n-1} r_n = a_{n-2} = c\n     \\]\n\n4. **Sum of Squares of the Roots**: We can calculate the sum of the squares of the roots using the identity:\n   \\[\n   r_1^2 + r_2^2 + \\cdots + r_n^2 = (r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n)^2 - 2(r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + \\ldots + r_{n-1} r_n)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the sums found earlier:\n   \\[\n   r_1^2 + r_2^2 + \\ldots + r_n^2 = c^2 - 2c\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Minimum Value**: To determine a lower bound for \\( S = c^2 - 2c \\), we can rewrite it in vertex form:\n   \\[\n   S = c^2 - 2c = (c - 1)^2 - 1\n   \\]\n   This expression reaches its minimum at \\( c = 1 \\), leading to:\n   \\[\n   S_{\\text{min}} = (1 - 1)^2 - 1 = -1\n   \\]\n\n6. **Absolute Value of the Lower Bound**: The greatest lower bound for the sum of the squares of the roots is \\( -1 \\), and its absolute value is:\n   \\[\n   | -1 | = 1\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{<1 solution>}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "By Vieta's Formulas, given that $r_1, r_2, \\cdots r_n$ are roots of the polynomial, we know that $\\sum_{i=1}^n r_i = -a_{n-1}$ and $r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 \\cdots r_{n-1}r_n = a_{n-2}$.\nFrom the equation $\\sum_{i=1}^n r_i = -a_{n-1}$, squaring both sides and substituting results in\\begin{align*} \\sum_{i=1}^n r_i^2 + 2(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 \\cdots r_{n-1}r_n) &= (a_{n-1})^2 \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^n r_i^2 + 2a_{n-2} &= (-a_{n-2})^2 \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^n r_i^2 &= (a_{n-2})^2 - 2a_{n-2} \\end{align*}To find the lower bound of $\\sum_{i=1}^n r_i^2$, we need to find the lower bound of $(a_{n-2})^2 - 2a_{n-2}$. The minimum of the quadratic is $-1$, so the absolute value of the lower bound of the sum of the squares is $\\boxed{1}$."
