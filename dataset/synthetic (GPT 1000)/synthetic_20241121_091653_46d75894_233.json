  "problem": "The diagonals of a rhombus measure 18 feet and 12 feet. What is the perimeter of the rhombus? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
  "solution": "To find the perimeter of a rhombus using its diagonal lengths, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rhombus Properties**: A rhombus has four equal sides and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles.\n\n2. **Given Diagonal Lengths**: The diagonals measure 18 feet and 12 feet. Therefore, the half-lengths of the diagonals are:\n   - Half of 18 feet = \\( 9 \\) feet\n   - Half of 12 feet = \\( 6 \\) feet\n\n3. **Right Triangle Formation**: The half diagonals create a right triangle with the side of the rhombus forming the hypotenuse. The lengths of the legs of this triangle are 9 feet and 6 feet.\n\n4. **Calculate the Side Length**: Using the Pythagorean theorem, let \\( s \\) represent the length of a side:\n   \\[\n   s = \\sqrt{(9^2) + (6^2)} = \\sqrt{81 + 36} = \\sqrt{117} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 13} = 3\\sqrt{13}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Perimeter**: The perimeter \\( P \\) of the rhombus is four times the length of a side:\n   \\[\n   P = 4 \\times s = 4 \\times 3\\sqrt{13} = 12\\sqrt{13}\n   \\]\n\n**Final answer**: \\( 12\\sqrt{13} \\) feet.",
  "ground_truth": "The diagonals of a rhombus intersect at a 90-degree angle, partitioning the rhombus into four congruent right triangles. The legs of  one of the triangles are 6 feet and 9 feet, so the hypotenuse of the triangle - which is also the side of the rhombus - is $\\sqrt{(6^2 + 9^2)} = \\sqrt{(36 + 81)} = \\sqrt{117}$ feet. Since $117 = 9 \\times 13$, we can simplify this as follows: $\\sqrt{117} = \\sqrt{(9 \\times 13)} = \\sqrt{9} \\times \\sqrt{13} = 3\\sqrt{13}$ feet. The perimeter of the rhombus is four times this amount or $4 \\times 3\\sqrt{13} = \\boxed{12\\sqrt{13}\\text{ feet}}$."
