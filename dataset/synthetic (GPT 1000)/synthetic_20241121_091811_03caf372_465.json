  "problem": "An assortment of 200 pencils is sold through a catalog for $\\$19.90$. Shipping is an additional $\\$6.95$. Including the charges for both the pencils and the shipping, what is the average cost, in cents, for each pencil? Express your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.",
  "solution": "To determine the average cost per pencil, inclusive of both the pencil price and shipping, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Cost:**\n   - The cost of the pencils is $19.90.\n   - The shipping cost is $6.95.\n   - Thus, the total cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cost} = 19.90 + 6.95 = 26.85 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert Total Cost to Cents:**\n   - To express the total cost in cents, we multiply by 100:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cost in Cents} = 26.85 \\times 100 = 2685 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Average Cost per Pencil:**\n   - Given that there are 200 pencils, we find the average cost per pencil by dividing the total cost in cents by the number of pencils:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average Cost per Pencil} = \\frac{2685 \\text{ cents}}{200} \n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division:**\n   - This results in:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2685}{200} = 13.425 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Round to the Nearest Whole Number:**\n   - When rounding 13.425 to the nearest whole number, we get 13.\n\nTherefore, the average cost per pencil, in cents, is **13**.",
  "ground_truth": "The average cost per pencil is equal to the total cost divided by the number of pencils. The total cost is $19.90+6.95=26.85$ dollars, or 2685 cents, and there are 200 pencils. Thus, the average cost is $\\frac{2685}{200}\\approx\\boxed{13}$ cents."
