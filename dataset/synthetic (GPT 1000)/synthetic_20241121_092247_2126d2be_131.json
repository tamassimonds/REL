  "problem": "For any integer $n>1$, the number of prime numbers greater than $n!+1$ and less than $n!+n$ is:\n$\\text{(A) } 0\\quad\\qquad \\text{(B) } 1\\quad\\\\ \\text{(C) } \\frac{n}{2} \\text{ for n even, } \\frac{n+1}{2} \\text{ for n odd}\\quad\\\\ \\text{(D) } n-1\\quad \\text{(E) } n$\n",
  "solution": "To determine the number of prime numbers that lie between \\( n! + 1 \\) and \\( n! + n \\), we will analyze the integers in the specified range.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Range**\n- The lower bound is \\( n! + 1 \\).\n- The upper bound is \\( n! + n \\).\n\nThus, we focus on the integers: \\( n! + 2, n! + 3, \\ldots, n! + n \\).\n\n**Step 2: Examine Each Integer**\nFor each integer \\( k \\) where \\( k \\) ranges from 2 to \\( n \\):\n- For \\( k = 2 \\), the number is \\( n! + 2 \\).\n- For \\( k = 3 \\), the number is \\( n! + 3 \\).\n- This continues up to \\( k = n \\), yielding \\( n! + n \\).\n\n**Step 3: Identify Compositeness**\nWe can rewrite each number \\( n! + k \\) as follows:\n\\[\nn! + k = k \\left(1 + \\frac{n!}{k}\\right).\n\\]\nHere, \\( \\frac{n!}{k} \\) is an integer because \\( n! \\) (the factorial of \\( n \\)) is divisible by all integers from 1 to \\( n \\). As a result, \\( n! + k \\) is inherently composite for all \\( k \\) in the range \\( 2 \\) to \\( n\\), since it has \\( k \\) as a factor.\n\n**Step 4: Count Composites**\nSince all \\( n! + k \\) for \\( k = 2, 3, \\ldots, n \\) are composite, we can conclude that there are no prime numbers in the range we defined. \n\n**Conclusion**\nThe total number of integers \\( k \\) from \\( 2 \\) to \\( n \\) is \\( n - 1 \\), meaning all of these integers contributing to \\( n! + k \\) are not prime.\n\nThus, the number of prime numbers greater than \\( n! + 1 \\) and less than \\( n! + n \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Observe that for all $k \\in 1< k< n$, since $k$ divides $n!$, $k$ also divides $n!+k$. Therefore, all numbers $a$ in the range $n!+1<a<n!+n$ are composite. Therefore there are $\\boxed{}$ primes in that range."
