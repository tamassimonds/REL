  "problem": "A square is drawn such that one of its sides coincides with the line $y = 5$, and so that the endpoints of this side lie on the parabola $y = x^2 + 3x + 2$. What is the area of the square?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, checking my work along the way, and adjusting as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nOkay, so we have a square with one of its sides lying on the line \\( y = 5 \\). The endpoints of this side are on the parabola \\( y = x^2 + 3x + 2 \\). We need to find the area of the square.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis involves geometry and algebra. The fact that a side lies on a horizontal line \\( y = 5 \\) suggests that the square is aligned with the axes. Also, since the endpoints lie on a parabola, we'll need to find the intersection points.\n\nBut wait... squares have equal sides, so once I find one side, the area is just that length squared. Sounds straightforward, but let's see if it really is.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Find the Intersection Points:**  \n   Determine where the line \\( y = 5 \\) intersects the parabola. These points would be the endpoints of the square's side.\n\n2. **Calculate the Side Length:**  \n   Use the distance between these intersection points to find the side length.\n\n3. **Compute the Area:**  \n   Square the side length to get the area.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis seems like a solid plan. However, let's consider if the square isn't perfectly aligned with the axes. No, the problem states that one side lies on \\( y = 5 \\), so it must be axis-aligned. This simplifies things.\n\n### **Exploring Strategy 1: Find Intersection Points**\n\nLet's start by finding where the line \\( y = 5 \\) intersects the parabola \\( y = x^2 + 3x + 2 \\).\n\n**Step 1:** Set the equations equal to each other:\n\\[\n5 = x^2 + 3x + 2\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:\n\\[\nx^2 + 3x + 2 - 5 = 0 \\implies x^2 + 3x - 3 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis looks like a standard quadratic equation. I can solve for \\( x \\) to find the intersection points. I'll proceed with the quadratic formula since factoring doesn't seem obvious.\n\n### **Solving the Quadratic Equation**\n\n**Step 3:** Apply the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a}\n\\]\nwhere \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 3 \\), and \\( c = -3 \\).\n\n**Step 4:** Plug in the values:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{{3^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-3)}}}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{{9 + 12}}}}{2} = \\frac{{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{21}}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5:** Calculate the two solutions:\n\\[\nx_1 = \\frac{{-3 + \\sqrt{21}}}{2}, \\quad x_2 = \\frac{{-3 - \\sqrt{21}}}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAlright, so we have two intersection points. These should be the endpoints of the square's side lying on \\( y = 5 \\).\n\n### **Checking the Intersection Points**\n\nBefore moving on, let's ensure these points make sense.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nPlugging \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) back into the parabola equation:\n\\[\ny = x^2 + 3x + 2\n\\]\nFor both \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\), substituting back should yield \\( y = 5 \\). Given how we solved it, this should hold true.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSince we set \\( y = 5 \\) initially, substituting back is more of a consistency check. Everything seems correct so far.\n\n### **Strategy 2: Calculate the Side Length**\n\nNow, let's find the distance between these two intersection points to determine the side length of the square.\n\n**Step 6:** Use the distance formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = |x_2 - x_1| = \\left| \\frac{{-3 - \\sqrt{21}}}{2} - \\frac{{-3 + \\sqrt{21}}}{2} \\right|\n\\]\n\n**Step 7:** Simplify the expression:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\left| \\frac{{-3 - \\sqrt{21} - (-3 + \\sqrt{21})}}{2} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{{-3 - \\sqrt{21} + 3 - \\sqrt{21}}}{2} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{{-2\\sqrt{21}}}{2} \\right| = \\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe side length is \\( \\sqrt{21} \\). That seems reasonable given the square root appeared in our quadratic solution.\n\n### **Strategy 3: Compute the Area**\n\nFinally, let's find the area of the square by squaring the side length.\n\n**Step 8:** Calculate the area:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = (\\sqrt{21})^2 = 21\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat was straightforward. The area is 21 square units. But wait, let's pause and think\u2014does this make sense? Given the distance between the intersection points and the alignment of the square, it seems plausible.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore finalizing the answer, let's do a sanity check.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- The parabola \\( y = x^2 + 3x + 2 \\) opens upwards, and the line \\( y = 5 \\) is horizontal. \n- The intersection points are where the parabola crosses \\( y = 5 \\), so the distance between these points should indeed be the side length of the square.\n- Since the square lies on \\( y = 5 \\) and spans between these points, the calculated area should be correct.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out. The approach seems solid, and the calculations are consistent with the problem's requirements.\n\n### **<ANSWER> Solution: 21 </ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Strategies and Thoughts**\n\nNow, let's brainstorm if there were other ways to approach this problem. Maybe there's a more intuitive method or a graphical interpretation.\n\n1. **Graphical Interpretation:**  \n   Visualizing the parabola and the horizontal line could help confirm the intersection points and side length.\n\n2. **Coordinate Geometry:**  \n   Using properties of squares and coordinate geometry to verify the alignment and dimensions.\n\n3. **Symmetry Considerations:**  \n   Checking if the parabola's symmetry affects the square's properties, though in this case, it's not necessary.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWhile alternative strategies can provide additional insights, the original approach was straightforward and effective. It's always good to have multiple methods in mind, but sticking with the most direct one that works is efficient.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically finding the intersection points, calculating the side length, and then determining the area, we've solved the problem step by step. Regular checks ensured accuracy throughout the process, leading us confidently to the final answer: an area of 21 square units.",
  "ground_truth": "The points of intersection of the line $y = 5$ and $y = x^2 + 3x + 2$ are found when $x^2 + 3x + 2 = 5$. Thus we have the quadratic  $x^2 + 3x -3=0$. By the quadratic formula,  $$x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot -3}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{21}}{2}$$We want to find the difference of these roots to find the difference of the x-coordinates of the points of intersection, which will give a side length of the square. The difference is $2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2} = \\sqrt{21}$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is the square of the side length, which is $(\\sqrt{21})^2 = \\boxed{21}$."
