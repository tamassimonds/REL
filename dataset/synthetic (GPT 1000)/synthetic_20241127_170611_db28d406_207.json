  "problem": "Compute the domain of the real-valued function $$f(x)=\\sqrt{3-\\sqrt{5-\\sqrt{x}}}.$$",
  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem as if I'm working it out on paper, maintaining the original strategy but organizing it into a coherent and complete solution. I'll walk through each step, reflecting and checking along the way to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the function:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sqrt{3 - \\sqrt{5 - \\sqrt{x}}}\n\\]\n\nIt immediately strikes me as a **nested square root problem**. My initial instinct is to determine the domain by ensuring all expressions under the square roots are **non-negative**, making the function real-valued. This reminds me of similar problems where working from the **innermost function outward** was effective.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure whether that's the only way\u2014maybe an **outside-in** approach or even visualizing the graph could help. However, starting from the inside seems the most straightforward, so I'll begin there and adjust if necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Dealing with the Innermost Square Root \\(\\sqrt{x}\\)**\n\n**Brainstorming Approach:**  \nTo ensure \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) is real, the expression inside must be **non-negative**. Therefore:\n\n\\[\nx \\geq 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis makes sense because the square root of a negative number isn't real. It's a simple condition, but essential to start with.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIf \\(x = 0\\), then \\(\\sqrt{0} = 0\\), which is perfectly fine. So, this condition holds.\n\n**Proceeding:**  \nAlright, this step seems correct. Let's move on to the next layer.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Moving to the Next Square Root \\(\\sqrt{5 - \\sqrt{x}}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, I need the expression inside this square root to be **non-negative**:\n\n\\[\n5 - \\sqrt{x} \\geq 0\n\\]\n\n**Solving the Inequality:**  \nLet's rearrange this to find the acceptable values of \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x} \\leq 5\n\\]\n\n**Next Step:**  \nTo eliminate the square root, I'll square both sides:\n\n\\[\nx \\leq 25\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nCombining this with the first condition, we have:\n\n\\[\n0 \\leq x \\leq 25\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \n- If \\(x = 25\\):  \n  \\(\\sqrt{25} = 5\\), and \\(5 - 5 = 0\\), which is fine.\n- If \\(x = 0\\):  \n  \\(\\sqrt{0} = 0\\), and \\(5 - 0 = 5\\), which is also fine.\n\nSo, this range works.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis approach seems solid. The innermost square root is properly constrained. Let's move on to the outermost square root.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Considering the Outermost Square Root \\(\\sqrt{3 - \\sqrt{5 - \\sqrt{x}}}\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNext, I need the expression inside this square root to be **non-negative**:\n\n\\[\n3 - \\sqrt{5 - \\sqrt{x}} \\geq 0\n\\]\n\n**Solving the Inequality:**  \nLet's rearrange:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{5 - \\sqrt{x}} \\leq 3\n\\]\n\n**Next Step:**  \nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\[\n5 - \\sqrt{x} \\leq 9\n\\]\n\n**Rearranging:**  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{x} \\geq 5 - 9 \\\\\n\\sqrt{x} \\geq -4\n\\]\n\n**Interpretation:**  \nWait a minute\u2014\\(\\sqrt{x}\\) is always **non-negative**, so \\(\\sqrt{x} \\geq -4\\) is **automatically true** for all \\(x \\geq 0\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis inequality doesn't impose any new restrictions beyond what we've already established (\\(0 \\leq x \\leq 25\\)). Interesting! It means the outermost square root is always defined within this range.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nSince \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) is always non-negative and \\(-4\\) is negative, this condition is always satisfied. No additional constraints are needed.\n\n**Proceeding:**  \nEverything checks out so far. Let's perform a final check to ensure the domain is correctly identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check: Ensuring All Conditions Are Met**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing the domain, I'll verify that all parts of the function are defined within the range \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 25\\).\n\n**Checking Extremes:**  \n- **At \\(x = 0\\):**  \n  \\(\\sqrt{0} = 0\\)  \n  \\(\\sqrt{5 - 0} = \\sqrt{5}\\)  \n  \\(\\sqrt{3 - \\sqrt{5}} \\approx \\sqrt{3 - 2.236} \\approx \\sqrt{0.764}\\), which is real.\n\n- **At \\(x = 25\\):**  \n  \\(\\sqrt{25} = 5\\)  \n  \\(\\sqrt{5 - 5} = \\sqrt{0} = 0\\)  \n  \\(\\sqrt{3 - 0} = \\sqrt{3}\\), which is real.\n\n**Intermediate Values:**  \nSince all the expressions inside the square roots are **continuous and non-negative** within this range, the function should be well-defined for all \\(x\\) in \\([0, 25]\\).\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nNo contradictions or undefined behaviors at the endpoints or within the interval.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything seems to check out. The domain \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 25\\) ensures that all nested square roots have non-negative arguments, making \\(f(x)\\) real-valued.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>  \n**The domain of the function \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{3 - \\sqrt{5 - \\sqrt{x}}}\\) is:**  \n\\[\n0 \\leq x \\leq 25\n\\]  \nor in interval notation:  \n\\[\n[0, 25]\n\\]  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy systematically working from the **innermost square root outward** and checking each step, I ensured that all parts of the function are defined within the specified domain. Reflecting and verifying at each stage helped catch any potential oversights, confirming that the domain \\([0, 25]\\) is correct.\n\nIt's important to always validate your approach by checking boundary cases and ensuring continuity within the domain. Thinking critically and being open to adjusting your strategy as needed ensures arriving at the correct solution.\n\n---\n\nAnd there we have it! By carefully following each step and continuously reflecting on the process, we've successfully determined the domain of the given function.",
  "ground_truth": "For the contents of the innermost square root to be nonnegative, we must have $x\\geq 0$.  To satisfy the middle square root, we must have  $$5-\\sqrt{x}\\geq 0$$ $$\\Rightarrow 25\\geq x.$$ Finally, the outermost square root requires $$3-\\sqrt{5-\\sqrt{x}}\\geq 0$$ or $$9\\geq 5-\\sqrt{x}$$ $$\\Rightarrow \\sqrt{x}\\geq -4,$$ which is always true. Combining our inequalities, we get $$0\\leq x\\leq 25,$$ or $x \\in \\boxed{[0, 25]}$ in interval notation."
