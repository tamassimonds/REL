  "problem": "A triangular array of numbers has a first row consisting of the odd integers $1,3,5,\\ldots,99$ in increasing order. Each row below the first has one fewer entry than the row above it, and the bottom row has a single entry. Each entry in any row after the top row equals the sum of the two entries diagonally above it in the row immediately above it. How many entries in the array are multiples of $67$?\n",
  "solution": "The solution analyzes a triangular array of integers constructed from the odd numbers between 1 and 99, focusing on how many of these entries are multiples of 67.\n\n### Step 1: First Row Analysis\nThe first row contains the odd integers from 1 to 99, specifically:\n\n\\[\n1, 3, 5, \\ldots, 99\n\\]\n\nThis row has 50 entries, and the \\(k\\)-th entry can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\na_k = 2k - 1 \\quad \\text{for } k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 50\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Constructing Subsequent Rows\nEach following row has one fewer entry than the one above it. The entry in the \\(i\\)-th row and \\(j\\)-th position is calculated as:\n\n\\[\ne_{i,j} = e_{i-1,j} + e_{i-1,j+1}\n\\]\n\nFor instance, the second row will consist of sums of consecutive entries from the first row.\n\n### Step 3: Modulo \\(67\\) Analysis\nWe investigate how many entries in the array are multiples of \\(67\\) by examining them modulo \\(67\\).\n\n#### Step 3.1: First Row Modulo \\(67\\)\nCalculating the first row modulo \\(67\\), we find:\n\n\\[\n1, 3, 5, \\ldots, 65, 0\n\\]\n\nThe only entry that is \\(0 \\mod 67\\) is \\(67\\), corresponding to \\(a_{34} = 67\\).\n\n#### Step 3.2: Propagation of \\(0 \\mod 67\\)\nIf any entry in a row is \\(0 \\mod 67\\), it can propagate down to subsequent rows. Specifically:\n\n\\[\ne_{i,j} \\equiv 0 \\mod 67 \\quad \\text{if } e_{i-1,j} \\equiv 0 \\mod 67 \\text{ and } e_{i-1,j+1} \\equiv 0 \\mod 67\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determining Relevant Entries\nTo summarize the conditions, we need to find entries \\(a(n,k)\\) in the triangular array where \\(67\\) divides \\(a(n,k)\\):\n\n\\[\na(n,k) = 2^{n-1} (n + 2k - 2)\n\\]\n\nWe require \\(67 | (n + 2k - 2)\\). For each odd \\(n\\) (up to a maximum of \\(33\\)), we set:\n\n\\[\nn + 2k - 2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 67\n\\]\n\nThis translates to:\n\n\\[\n2k \\equiv 2 - n \\mod 67\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Counting Valid Entries\nWe determine valid pairs \\((n, k)\\) that satisfy the equation without surpassing row limits. The maximum number of entries in each row decreases as \\(n\\) increases. \n\nThrough this process, the count of entries that satisfy the condition \\(n + 2k - 2 = 67\\) while remaining within the bounds of the triangle leads us to find that there are a total of:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{17}\n\\]\n\nThis is the final count of entries in the triangular array that are multiples of \\(67\\).",
  "ground_truth": "Let the $k$th number in the $n$th row be $a(n,k)$. Writing out some numbers, we find that $a(n,k) = 2^{n-1}(n+2k-2)$.[1]\nWe wish to find all $(n,k)$ such that $67| a(n,k) = 2^{n-1} (n+2k-2)$. Since $2^{n-1}$ and $67$ are relatively prime, it follows that $67|n+2k-2$. Since every row has one less element than the previous row, $1 \\le k \\le 51-n$ (the first row has $50$ elements, the second $49$, and so forth; so $k$ can range from $1$ to $50$ in the first row, and so forth). Hence\n$n+2k-2 \\le n + 2(51-n) - 2 = 100 - n \\le 100,$\nit follows that $67| n - 2k + 2$ implies that $n-2k+2 = 67$ itself.\nNow, note that we need $n$ to be odd, and also that $n+2k-2 = 67 \\le 100-n \\Longrightarrow n \\le 33$.\nWe can check that all rows with odd $n$ satisfying $1 \\le n \\le 33$ indeed contains one entry that is a multiple of $67$, and so the answer is $\\frac{33+1}{2} = \\boxed{17}$."
