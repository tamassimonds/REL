  "solution": "Certainly! Let's tackle this problem just like a human would\u2014thinking it through step by step, exploring different strategies, reflecting on each approach, checking for correctness, and being open to adjusting methods along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nAlright, so we're asked to find the sum of the last two digits of the series:\n\n\\[1! + 1! + 2! + 3! + 5! + 8! + 13! + 21! + 34! + 55! + 89!\\]\n\n**Initial Reactions:**\n\n- **Oh, I see!** These are factorials of Fibonacci numbers.  \n- **Hmm...** Factorials grow really fast, so computing each one in full might be overkill, especially for large numbers like \\(89!\\).  \n- **Wait, does that mean...** We only care about the last two digits of the sum. Sounds like a job for modular arithmetic!\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Thinking back to similar problems...** I remember using mod \\(100\\) to focus on the last two digits before.  \n- **But can I just...** Compute each factorial's last two digits and sum them up?  \n- **Let\u2019s explore that idea.**\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Different Strategies**\n\n1. **Compute Each Factorial's Last Two Digits Directly:**  \n   - **Pros:** Straightforward, just calculate and sum.  \n   - **Cons:** Factorials like \\(89!\\) are massive; might be impractical to compute directly.\n\n2. **Use Modular Arithmetic (Mod \\(100\\))**:  \n   - **Pros:** Keeps computations manageable by focusing only on the last two digits.  \n   - **Cons:** Still requires careful calculation for larger factorials.\n\n3. **Identify Patterns in Factorials:**  \n   - **Ah!** For large \\(n\\), \\(n!\\) ends with zeros because \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\) and factorials have plenty of 2s and 5s.  \n   - **Pros:** Could simplify the problem significantly by ignoring terms that contribute zeros.  \n   - **Cons:** Need to determine from which point factorials stop affecting the last two digits.\n\n**Initial Preference:**\n\n- **Maybe starting with the first strategy...** But if it gets too complicated, I\u2019ll switch to the second or third.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting to Compute Each Factorial\u2019s Last Two Digits**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Let\u2019s see how far I can go with direct computation.**  \n- **I\u2019ll start with smaller factorials and observe any patterns.**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **\\(1! = 1\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 01  \n   - **Check:** \\(1! = 1\\) \u2014 Easy peasy!\n\n2. **\\(1! = 1\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 01  \n   - **Check:** Repeated term, still 01.\n\n3. **\\(2! = 2\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 02  \n   - **Check:** \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) \u2014 No issues here.\n\n4. **\\(3! = 6\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 06  \n   - **Check:** \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) \u2014 All good.\n\n5. **\\(5! = 120\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 20  \n   - **Check:** \\(5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\\) \u2014 Yep, correct.\n\n6. **\\(8! = 40,320\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 20  \n   - **Check:** \\(8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 40,320\\) \u2014 Still accurate.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait a minute...** Starting from \\(5!\\), the last two digits are already ending in 20.  \n- **Oh! This reminds me that...** Larger factorials might end with zeros due to multiple factors of 10.  \n- **Does that mean...** Beyond a certain point, factorials won't affect the last two digits of the sum?\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Hold on, maybe this strategy needs tweaking.** Calculating each factorial up to \\(89!\\) is unnecessary if they end in zeros.  \n- **Time to reconsider and adopt a more efficient approach.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Switching to Modular Arithmetic and Identifying Patterns**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Let\u2019s use modular arithmetic to simplify things.**  \n- **I\u2019ll compute each factorial modulo \\(100\\) to focus only on the last two digits.**  \n- **Additionally, I'll look for patterns where factorials stop contributing to the sum.**\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n- **Compute each factorial modulo \\(100\\).**  \n- **Notice that for \\(n \\geq 10\\), \\(n!\\) includes multiple factors of 2 and 5, making \\(n!\\) divisible by \\(100\\).**  \n- **Sounds like a plan!**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **\\(1! \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 01\n\n2. **\\(1! \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 01\n\n3. **\\(2! \\equiv 2 \\mod 100\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 02\n\n4. **\\(3! \\equiv 6 \\mod 100\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 06\n\n5. **\\(5! \\equiv 20 \\mod 100\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 20\n\n6. **\\(8! \\equiv 20 \\mod 100\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 20\n\n7. **\\(13! \\equiv 0 \\mod 100\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 00  \n   - **Reasoning:** Starting from \\(10!\\), \\(n!\\) includes multiple factors of 5 and 2, making \\(n!\\) divisible by \\(100\\).\n\n8. **\\(21! \\equiv 0 \\mod 100\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 00\n\n9. **\\(34! \\equiv 0 \\mod 100\\)**  \n   - Last two digits: 00\n\n10. **\\(55! \\equiv 0 \\mod 100\\)**  \n    - Last two digits: 00\n\n11. **\\(89! \\equiv 0 \\mod 100\\)**  \n    - Last two digits: 00\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Oh! This makes sense because...** From \\(13!\\) onwards, the factorials end with at least two zeros, contributing nothing to the last two digits of the sum.  \n- **Great! Now I\u2019ve reduced the problem significantly.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Summing the Last Two Digits**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Now that I have the last two digits of each relevant factorial, let\u2019s sum them up.**  \n- **Then, I'll find the last two digits of the total sum and add those two digits together as per the problem statement.**\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Sum of Last Two Digits:**  \n   \\[01 + 01 + 02 + 06 + 20 + 20 + 00 + 00 + 00 + 00 + 00 = 50\\]\n\n2. **Last Two Digits of the Sum:**  \n   - The sum is 50, so the last two digits are 50.\n\n3. **Sum of the Last Two Digits:**  \n   - \\(5 + 0 = 5\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Hmm, let me double-check this...** Adding up the last two digits step by step confirms that the total is 50.  \n- **Wait, that checks out because...** The larger factorials don't contribute anything beyond zeros.  \n- **Perfect! The final sum of the last two digits is 5.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Conclusion**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Before finalizing, let\u2019s ensure everything makes sense.**  \n- **I\u2019ll verify each step to confirm there's no mistake.**  \n- **Better safe than sorry!**\n\n**Final Checks:**\n\n- **Factorials up to \\(8!\\):** Calculated correctly with their last two digits preserved.  \n- **Factorials from \\(13!\\) onwards:** Appropriately identified as contributing zeros due to multiple factors of 10.  \n- **Sum Calculation:** The addition of relevant last two digits sums up to 50, which is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Everything checks out!** The sum of the last two digits of the given series is **5**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>The sum of the last two digits is **5**.</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of the Thought Process**\n\n- **Brainstorming:** Started by considering direct computation but quickly realized the impracticality due to large factorials.  \n- **Strategy Change:** Shifted to using modular arithmetic and identifying patterns in factorials to simplify calculations.  \n- **Reflection and Checking:** Regularly checked each step to ensure correctness and adjusted the approach as needed.  \n- **Final Verification:** Confirmed the validity of the solution by re-evaluating the summed last two digits.\n\nBy approaching the problem in a human-like, reflective manner, the solution was reached efficiently and accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n- **I\u2019m glad I caught that early pattern!** Recognizing that larger factorials contribute zeros saved a lot of unnecessary computation.  \n- **This problem reminded me of the importance of looking for efficiencies.** Sometimes, noticing a pattern can drastically simplify a problem.  \n- **<ANSWER> solution ** Overall, the sum of the last two digits is indeed **5**.\n\nAlright, that's a complete, coherent solution just like a real human would work through it\u2014thinking, reflecting, and adjusting along the way.",
  "ground_truth": "This expression $n!$, is the number you get by multiplying $n$ by $(n-1)$ by $(n-2)$ by $(n-3)$ and so on, all the way down to $1$. So $5! = (5)(4)(3)(2)(1) = 120$. Notice that $5!$ ends in a $0$ since it has a factor of $10$ (there is a $5$ and a $2$ in it list of factors) and that $10!$ has to end in two zeroes since it has a factor of $10$, $5$ and $2$ which is really a factor of $100$. Since any factorial greater than $10$ (such as $13!$ or $21!$) includes all of the factors of $10!$, the last two digits of $13!$, $21!$, and so on are zeroes. These terms, therefore will not affect the last two digits of the sum of the Fibonacci factorial series.\nTo find the last two digits, you only need to find the last two digits of each of the terms of $1! + 1! + 2! + 3! + 5! + 8!$. We do not need to calculate $8!$, only to find its last two digits. Starting with $5!$, we can work our way to $8!$, using only the last two digits of each value along the way. We know $5! = 120$, so use $20$ when finding $6!$, which will bring us to $6(20) = 120$ or $20$. Therefore, the last two digits of $7!$ are from $7(20) = 140$ or $40$. Finally $8!$ is $8(40) = 320$ or finally $20$. The last two digits of the entire series will come from $1 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 20 + 20 = 50$. Therefore, the sum of the last two digits is $5 + 0 = \\boxed{5}$."
