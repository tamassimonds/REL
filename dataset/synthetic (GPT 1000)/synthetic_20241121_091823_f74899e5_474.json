  "problem": "100 people who were surveyed and asked the question: ``Is fuchsia kinda pink, or purply?'' Of them, 60 believe that fuchsia is ``kinda pink'' and 27 believe it is both ``kinda pink,'' and also ``purply.''  Another 17 think that fuchsia is neither ``kinda pink'' nor ``purply.''\n\nHow many of those 100 people believe that fuchsia is ``purply''?",
  "solution": "To address the problem, we analyze the beliefs of a group of 100 surveyed individuals regarding the color fuchsia. We define two sets:\n\n- Let \\( A \\) be the set of people who believe fuchsia is \"kinda pink\" (\\(|A| = 60\\)).\n- Let \\( B \\) be the set of people who believe fuchsia is \"purply\".\n\nGiven information includes the number of people who think fuchsia is both \"kinda pink\" and \"purply\" (\\(|A \\cap B| = 27\\)), and 17 individuals who believe it is neither color.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the number of people believing fuchsia is either \"kinda pink\" or \"purply\".\nSince 17 people reject both definitions, the number of people who believe it is either \"kinda pink\" or \"purply\" (or both) is:\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B| = 100 - 17 = 83.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Apply the inclusion-exclusion principle.\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle states:\n\n\\[\n|A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n83 = 60 + |B| - 27.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( |B| \\).\nNow we'll rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\n83 = 33 + |B|,\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n|B| = 83 - 33 = 50.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the number of people who believe that fuchsia is \"purply\" is \\( \\boxed{50} \\).",
  "ground_truth": "We can answer this question with a Venn diagram.  First we know that the intersection of ``kinda pink'' and ``purply'' contains 27 people.  We also know that 17 people fall outside both circles.

[asy]\nlabel(\"kinda pink\", (2,75));\nlabel(\"purply\", (80,75));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$27$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$33$\",(28,45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$23$\",(63,45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$17$\", (70, 15));\n[/asy] The total number of people who think fuchsia is ``purply'' is $27+23=\\boxed{50}$."
