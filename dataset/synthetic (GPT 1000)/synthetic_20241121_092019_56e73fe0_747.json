  "problem": "Ed and Sue bike at equal and constant rates. Similarly, they jog at equal and constant rates, and they swim at equal and constant rates. Ed covers $74$ kilometers after biking for $2$ hours, jogging for $3$ hours, and swimming for $4$ hours, while Sue covers $91$ kilometers after jogging for $2$ hours, swimming for $3$ hours, and biking for $4$ hours. Their biking, jogging, and swimming rates are all whole numbers of kilometers per hour. Find the sum of the squares of Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates.\n",
  "solution": "Here's a clearer and more coherent summary of the solution:\n\n---\n\nWe want to find the biking, jogging, and swimming rates for Ed and Sue, represented by \\( b \\), \\( j \\), and \\( s \\) respectively.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up the Equations\n\nWe start by creating equations based on the distances traveled:\n\n**For Ed:**\n- Biked for 2 hours: \\( 2b \\)\n- Jogged for 3 hours: \\( 3j \\)\n- Swam for 4 hours: \\( 4s \\)\n\nTotal distance for Ed:\n\\[\n2b + 3j + 4s = 74 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\n**For Sue:**\n- Jogged for 2 hours: \\( 2j \\)\n- Swam for 3 hours: \\( 3s \\)\n- Biked for 4 hours: \\( 4b \\)\n\nTotal distance for Sue:\n\\[\n4b + 2j + 3s = 91 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Manipulate the Equations\n\nNext, we manipulate the equations to eliminate one variable. We multiply equation (1) by 2 to align coefficients with equation (2):\n\\[\n4b + 6j + 8s = 148 \\quad \\text{(3)}\n\\]\n\nWe keep equation (2) as is:\n\\[\n4b + 2j + 3s = 91 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Subtract the Equations\n\nNow, we subtract equation (2) from equation (3) to simplify:\n\\[\n(4b + 6j + 8s) - (4b + 2j + 3s) = 148 - 91\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n4j + 5s = 57 \\quad \\text{(4)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\( s \\)\n\nFrom equation (4), we can express \\( s \\) in terms of \\( j \\):\n\\[\n5s = 57 - 4j \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad s = \\frac{57 - 4j}{5} \\quad \\text{(5)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Substitute Back into Equation (1)\n\nNext, we substitute \\( s \\) from equation (5) into equation (1):\n\\[\n2b + 3j + 4\\left(\\frac{57 - 4j}{5}\\right) = 74\n\\]\nMultiplying through by 5 to eliminate the fraction:\n\\[\n10b + 15j + 4(57 - 4j) = 370\n\\]\nDistributing gives us:\n\\[\n10b + 15j + 228 - 16j = 370\n\\]\nCombining like terms yields:\n\\[\n10b - j + 228 = 370 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 10b - j = 142 \\quad \\text{(6)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( j \\) in Terms of \\( b \\)\n\nFrom equation (6), we can express \\( j \\) as:\n\\[\nj = 10b - 142 \\quad \\text{(7)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Substitute \\( j \\) Back into Equation (5)\n\nNow substitute (7) into equation (5) to find \\( s \\):\n\\[\ns = \\frac{57 - 4(10b - 142)}{5}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{625 - 40b}{5} = 125 - 8b \\quad \\text{(8)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Determine Integer Solutions\n\nTo find positive integer values for \\( b \\), \\( j \\), and \\( s \\):\n\n1. From equation (7): \\( 10b - 142 > 0 \\rightarrow b > 14.2 \\) implies \\( b \\geq 15 \\).\n2. From equation (8): \\( 125 - 8b > 0 \\rightarrow b < 15.625 \\) implies \\( b \\leq 15 \\).\n\nThus, we conclude that \\( b = 15 \\).\n\n### Step 9: Calculate \\( j \\) and \\( s \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( b = 15 \\) into equations (7) and (8):\n\\[\nj = 10(15) - 142 = 8\n\\]\n\\[\ns = 125 - 8(15) = 5\n\\]\n\n### Step 10: Calculate the Sum of the Squares\n\nFinally, we have:\n- \\( b = 15 \\)\n- \\( j = 8 \\)\n- \\( s = 5 \\)\n\nCalculating the sum of the squares:\n\\[\nb^2 + j^2 + s^2 = 15^2 + 8^2 + 5^2 = 225 + 64 + 25 = 314\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe solution leads us to the final answer:\n\\[\n\\text{The sum of the squares of Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates is } \\textbf{314.}\n\\] \n\n--- \n\nThis summary presents a clearer flow of the steps involved in solving the problem while retaining the necessary details.",
  "ground_truth": "Let the biking rate be $b$, swimming rate be $s$, jogging rate be $j$, all in km/h.\nWe have $2b + 3j + 4s = 74,2j + 3s + 4b = 91$. Subtracting the second from twice the first gives $4j + 5s = 57$. Mod 4, we need $s\\equiv1\\pmod{4}$. Thus, $(j,s) = (13,1),(8,5),(3,9)$.\n$(13,1)$ and $(3,9)$ give non-integral $b$, but $(8,5)$ gives $b = 15$. Thus, our answer is $15^{2} + 8^{2} + 5^{2} = \\boxed{314}$."
