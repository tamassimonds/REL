  "problem": "Five couples were at a party. If each person shook hands exactly once with everyone else except his/her spouse, how many handshakes were exchanged? (Note: One obviously doesn't shake hands with oneself.)",
  "solution": "Sure, let's put all the components together into a coherent and complete solution while maintaining the original thought process and final answer.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts:**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this problem. We have five couples at a party, and each person shakes hands with everyone except their spouse and themselves. My initial reaction is that this sounds familiar\u2014kind of like those classic handshake problems I've encountered before. However, I'm not entirely sure about the best way to approach it right off the bat. Perhaps starting with brainstorming different strategies would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Total Handshakes Minus Spouse Exclusions:**\n   - Calculate the total possible handshakes if there were no restrictions and then subtract the handshakes that don't happen (i.e., with their spouses).\n\n2. **Counting Handshakes Per Person:**\n   - Determine how many handshakes each person makes and multiply by the number of people.\n\n3. **Graph Theory Approach:**\n   - Think of each person as a node in a graph, with edges representing handshakes, excluding the edge to their spouse.\n\n4. **Simple Listing:**\n   - List out all possible handshakes to ensure none are missed.\n\nHmm, I'm inclined to start with the **Total Handshakes Minus Spouse Exclusions** method as it seems the most straightforward. But I'll keep the other methods in mind just in case this doesn't pan out.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring the First Strategy: Total Handshakes Minus Spouse Exclusions**\n\n#### **Step 1: Calculate Total Handshakes Without Restrictions**\n\nWait, how do I calculate the total handshakes if everyone shook hands with everyone else, including their spouses?\n\n- **Thought Process:** There are 10 people in total (5 couples). Normally, the number of handshakes is the combination of 10 people taken 2 at a time:\n\n  \\[\n  \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45\n  \\]\n\n- **Reflection:** So, there would be 45 handshakes if everyone shook hands with everyone else. But since people don't shake hands with themselves, do I need to adjust this?\n\n- **Realization:** Actually, the formula \\(\\binom{10}{2}\\) already accounts for pairs, so self-handshakes aren't included. Phew, almost overthought that!\n\n#### **Step 2: Subtract Handshakes with Spouses**\n\n- **Calculation:** Each of the 5 couples would normally have 1 handshake with their spouse, so that's 5 handshakes to subtract:\n\n  \\[\n  45 - 5 = 40\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Does this make sense? By removing the 5 spouse handshakes from the total, I end up with 40 handshakes where everyone shakes hands with everyone else except their spouse.\n\n**Initial Conclusion:**  \nSo, using this method, there are **40 handshakes**.\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection: Is This Correct?**\n\nHmm, let me think about whether this approach makes sense. If each person shakes hands with everyone except their spouse, does subtracting only 5 handshakes account for all the exclusions?\n\n- **Doubt:** Wait a minute, if each person has a spouse, aren't there more exclusions happening per person? Maybe subtracting just 5 is oversimplifying.\n\n- **Thought Process:** Let's see... Each of the 10 people is avoiding shaking hands with 1 person (their spouse), so that's 10 exclusions in total. But am I double-counting here?\n\n- **Realization:** Oh! I think I messed up by only subtracting 5 handshakes. Each couple has 2 people not shaking hands with each other, so I need to account for that differently.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-examining the Strategy:**\n\n#### **Step 1: Recalculate Total Handshakes Minus Double Counting**\n\n- **Thought Process:** Since each handshake involves two people, and each person is avoiding their spouse, I need to ensure I'm not double-counting the exclusions.\n\n- **Calculation:** Each of the 10 people avoids 1 handshake (with their spouse), so that's 10 avoided handshakes in total. But since a handshake involves two people, I've double-counted each handshake avoidance.\n\n- **Correct Adjustment:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\frac{10 \\text{ avoided handshakes}}{2} = 5 \\text{ unique handshakes avoided}\n  \\]\n\n  So, subtracting these 5 unique handshakes from the total:\n\n  \\[\n  45 - 5 = 40\n  \\]\n\n- **Check:** Does this make sense now? Yes, by correctly accounting for the double-counting, the total remains **40 handshakes**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nAfter carefully considering and correcting the initial approach, the total number of handshakes exchanged is:\n\n<ANSWER>40 handshakes</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Initial Approach:** Calculated total handshakes and subtracted spouse handshakes.\n- **Reflection:** Realized that only subtracting 5 handshakes might be oversimplifying.\n- **Correction:** Double-checked the exclusions and confirmed that 5 unique handshakes are avoided.\n- **Final Verification:** Ensured that all necessary exclusions were accounted for, leading to a total of 40 handshakes.\n\nBy thoroughly re-examining the strategy and reflecting on potential oversights, the final solution remains consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts:**\n\nApproaching problems with an open mind and being willing to re-evaluate initial strategies is crucial. Here, recognizing the potential for double-counting and adjusting the calculations ensured an accurate solution. Always take time to reflect and verify each step to avoid common pitfalls in problem-solving.\n\n---\n\nThere you have it\u2014a complete, coherent solution that incorporates initial thoughts, reflections, and corrections to arrive at the final answer of **40 handshakes**.",
  "ground_truth": "There are a total of 10 people at the party.  Each shakes hands with everyone else, except for their spouse, which will be a total of $10-2=8$ other people.  The total number of handshakes will be $10\\cdot8/2=\\boxed{40}$, where we divide by 2 to correct for counting each handshake twice."
