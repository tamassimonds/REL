  "problem": "The digits of a positive integer $n$ are four consecutive integers in decreasing order when read from left to right. What is the sum of the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$?",
  "solution": "**Understanding the Question**\n\nFirst Thoughts:\n- The problem involves a number \\( n \\) with digits as four consecutive integers in decreasing order.\n- We need to find the sum of possible remainders when \\( n \\) is divided by 37.\n- This suggests using modular arithmetic and understanding the properties of such digit patterns.\n\nInitial Brainstorm:\n- I could list all possible \\( n \\) and compute their remainders individually.\n- Alternatively, there might be a mathematical shortcut based on the properties of these numbers.\n- Since I'm unsure, I'll explore both strategies to determine the most efficient approach.\n\n**Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n### Strategy 1: Listing Possible Numbers\n- Begin by identifying all numbers \\( n \\) with four consecutive decreasing digits.\n- The digits range from 9 to 0, limiting the possible combinations.\n\nDefining the Numbers:\n- The possible sets of four consecutive digits in decreasing order are:\n  1. 9876\n  2. 8765\n  3. 7654\n  4. 6543\n  5. 5432\n  6. 4321\n  7. 3210\n- Therefore, there are exactly seven possible numbers \\( n \\).\n\nReflection:\n- With only seven numbers, calculating each remainder manually seems feasible.\n- This approach is straightforward and ensures completeness.\n\n### Strategy 2: Checking for Patterns or Properties\n- Before calculating, consider whether there's a pattern in how these numbers behave modulo 37.\n- If a pattern exists, it might simplify the problem and reduce computation.\n\nThinking Out Loud:\n- Numbers with consecutive digits might exhibit specific divisibility properties.\n- However, since 37 is a prime number, direct connections to digit patterns aren't obvious.\n- Given the uncertainty, proceeding with the first strategy is prudent.\n\n**Proceeding with Strategy 1: Calculating Remainders**\n\n### Step 1: Compute the Remainder of Each Number\n\n1. **Number: 9876**\n   - Calculation: \\( 9876 \\div 37 = 267 \\) remainder \\( r_1 \\)\n   - Finding \\( r_1 \\): \\( 9876 - 267 \\times 37 = 9876 - 9879 = -3 \\)\n   - Adjusting for Non-Negative Remainder: \\( r_1 = -3 + 37 = 34 \\)\n\n   **Reflection:**\n   - The remainder is 34, indicating \\( 9876 \\) is slightly less than a multiple of 37.\n\n2. **Number: 8765**\n   - Calculation: \\( 8765 \\div 37 = 236 \\) remainder \\( r_2 \\)\n   - Finding \\( r_2 \\): \\( 8765 - 236 \\times 37 = 8765 - 8732 = 33 \\)\n   - Remainder: \\( r_2 = 33 \\)\n\n   **Quick Check:**\n   - The remainder decreases as the number decreases, suggesting a pattern.\n\n3. **Number: 7654**\n   - Calculation: \\( 7654 \\div 37 = 206 \\) remainder \\( r_3 \\)\n   - Finding \\( r_3 \\): \\( 7654 - 206 \\times 37 = 7654 - 7622 = 32 \\)\n   - Remainder: \\( r_3 = 32 \\)\n\n   **Thought Process:**\n   - Noticing a consistent decrease in remainders by 1 for each consecutive number.\n\n4. **Number: 6543**\n   - Calculation: \\( 6543 \\div 37 = 176 \\) remainder \\( r_4 \\)\n   - Finding \\( r_4 \\): \\( 6543 - 176 \\times 37 = 6543 - 6512 = 31 \\)\n   - Remainder: \\( r_4 = 31 \\)\n\n   **Reflection:**\n   - The pattern holds, reinforcing the accuracy of the calculations.\n\n5. **Number: 5432**\n   - Calculation: \\( 5432 \\div 37 = 146 \\) remainder \\( r_5 \\)\n   - Finding \\( r_5 \\): \\( 5432 - 146 \\times 37 = 5432 - 5402 = 30 \\)\n   - Remainder: \\( r_5 = 30 \\)\n\n   **Quick Check:**\n   - Consistency in the decreasing pattern confirms the correctness.\n\n6. **Number: 4321**\n   - Calculation: \\( 4321 \\div 37 = 116 \\) remainder \\( r_6 \\)\n   - Finding \\( r_6 \\): \\( 4321 - 116 \\times 37 = 4321 - 4292 = 29 \\)\n   - Remainder: \\( r_6 = 29 \\)\n\n   **Thought Process:**\n   - The decreasing pattern remains intact, validating the approach.\n\n7. **Number: 3210**\n   - Calculation: \\( 3210 \\div 37 = 86 \\) remainder \\( r_7 \\)\n   - Finding \\( r_7 \\): \\( 3210 - 86 \\times 37 = 3210 - 3182 = 28 \\)\n   - Remainder: \\( r_7 = 28 \\)\n\n   **Final Check:**\n   - The pattern consistently decreases by 1, confirming the calculations are correct.\n\n### Step 2: Sum of the Remainders\n\n- Calculate the total sum of all remainders:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Sum} = 34 + 33 + 32 + 31 + 30 + 29 + 28 = 217\n  \\]\n\nReflection:\n- The sum is 217, which aligns with expectations given the consistent decrease in remainders.\n- The simplicity of the pattern supports the accuracy of the solution.\n\n**Checking the Work**\n\nQuick Verification:\n- Each decrement in the remainder corresponds to the decrement in the number \\( n \\) by 1111.\n- This regularity suggests that the approach is sound and the calculations are correct.\n\nDeep Reflection:\n- Ensure no possible numbers are overlooked.\n- Given that all four-digit numbers with consecutive decreasing digits are listed, the solution is complete.\n\nFinal Check:\n- The consistent pattern in remainders verifies the correctness of the approach.\n- No anomalies or errors are detected, confirming the solution's validity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{217}\\]\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n- By listing all possible numbers \\( n \\) with four consecutive decreasing digits and calculating their remainders when divided by 37, the sum of all possible remainders is determined to be **217**.\n- The straightforward, step-by-step approach ensures accuracy and completeness.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n- Initially considering multiple strategies helped identify the most efficient solution.\n- Calculating each remainder individually provided clarity and confirmed the pattern.\n- Consistent verification throughout the process ensured the reliability of the final answer.",
  "ground_truth": "A brute-force solution to this question is fairly quick, but we'll try something slightly more clever: our numbers have the form ${\\underline{(n+3)}}\\,{\\underline{(n+2)}}\\,{\\underline{( n+1)}}\\,{\\underline {(n)}}$$= 1000(n + 3) + 100(n + 2) + 10(n + 1) + n = 3210 + 1111n$, for $n \\in \\lbrace0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\rbrace$.\nNow, note that $3\\cdot 37 = 111$ so $30 \\cdot 37 = 1110$, and $90 \\cdot 37 = 3330$ so $87 \\cdot 37 = 3219$. So the remainders are all congruent to $n - 9 \\pmod{37}$. However, these numbers are negative for our choices of $n$, so in fact the remainders must equal $n + 28$.\nAdding these numbers up, we get $(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) + 7\\cdot28 = \\boxed{217}$."
