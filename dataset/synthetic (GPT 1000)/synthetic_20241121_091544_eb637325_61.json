  "problem": "23 people attend a party. Each person shakes hands with at least two other people. What is the minimum possible number of handshakes?",
  "solution": "To find the minimum number of handshakes at a party with 23 attendees, where each person shakes hands with at least two others, we can follow this reasoning:\n\n1. **Handshakes per Person**: Each person must shake hands with at least 2 others. Therefore, if there are 23 people, the minimum number of handshake contributions made is:\n   \\[\n   23 \\text{ people} \\times 2 \\text{ handshakes/person} = 46 \\text{ contributed handshakes}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Unique Handshakes Calculation**: Since each handshake involves two individuals, the total number of unique handshakes is half of the total contributions:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{46 \\text{ contributions}}{2} = 23 \\text{ unique handshakes}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Feasibility Check**: We need to verify that it is feasible for each person to shake hands with at least two others while having only 23 unique handshakes. A suitable configuration is to arrange the participants in a simple cycle, where each person shakes hands with their two immediate neighbors. For instance:\n   - Person 1 shakes hands with Person 2 and Person 23.\n   - Person 2 shakes hands with Person 1 and Person 3, and so on, until\n   - Person 23 shakes hands with Person 22 and Person 1.\n\nThis setup ensures that every person shakes hands with exactly 2 others, fulfilling the requirement.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum possible number of handshakes, given that each of the 23 participants shakes hands with at least two others, is:\n\n<ANSWER>23</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "If each person shakes hands with exactly two other people, then there will be $\\frac{23 \\cdot 2}{2} = \\boxed{23}$ handshakes. To achieve 23 handshakes, we arrange the participants in a circle. Each person shakes hands with the two people next to him or her."
