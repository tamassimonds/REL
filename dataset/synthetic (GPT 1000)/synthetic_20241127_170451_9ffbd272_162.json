  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process as naturally as possible, exploring different strategies, checking my work frequently, and being open to changing direction if needed. Let\u2019s begin by understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n**Question Recap:**\n\n- Point \\( P \\) lies on the line \\( x = -3 \\) and is 10 units away from the point \\( (5,2) \\).\n- Find the product of all possible \\( y \\)-coordinates that satisfy these conditions.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n\nOkay, so \\( P \\) is on a vertical line \\( x = -3 \\). The distance from \\( P \\) to \\( (5,2) \\) is given as 10 units. This reminds me of using the distance formula since we're dealing with Euclidean distance. But only the \\( y \\)-coordinate is unknown because \\( x \\) is fixed at \\( -3 \\).\n\n**Brainstorming Strategies:**\n\n1. **Use the Distance Formula:** This seems like the most straightforward approach.\n2. **Visualize the Problem:** Maybe sketching it out could help.\n3. **Check for Symmetry:** Perhaps there are multiple solutions due to the nature of distance.\n\nI'll start by attempting the distance formula, but I'll keep the other strategies in mind in case I need them.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Applying the Distance Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe distance between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( P \\) is \\((-3, y)\\) and the other point is \\((5,2)\\) with \\( d = 10 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n10 = \\sqrt{(5 - (-3))^2 + (2 - y)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying inside the square root:\n\n\\[\n10 = \\sqrt{8^2 + (2 - y)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + (2 - y)^2}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis looks correct so far. The horizontal distance is \\( 8 \\) units since \\( -3 \\) to \\( 5 \\) is \\( 8 \\).\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Eliminating the Square Root**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSquaring both sides will make the equation easier to handle.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n10^2 = 64 + (2 - y)^2 \\\\\n100 = 64 + (2 - y)^2\n\\]\n\nSubtract 64 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n36 = (2 - y)^2\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThis simplifies nicely to a quadratic equation. It seems correct because squaring should give a positive value, and 36 is indeed positive.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nTake the square root of both sides to solve for \\( y \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\( y \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nTaking the square root will give two possible solutions since both positive and negative roots are valid.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n\\[\n2 - y = \\pm 6\n\\]\n\nThis yields two equations:\n\n1. \\( 2 - y = 6 \\)\n2. \\( 2 - y = -6 \\)\n\nSolving each:\n\n1. \\( y = 2 - 6 = -4 \\)\n2. \\( y = 2 + 6 = 8 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nSo, there are two possible \\( y \\)-coordinates: \\( -4 \\) and \\( 8 \\). This makes sense because the distance constraint can be satisfied in two directions (up and down).\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nVerify these solutions to ensure they're correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solutions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nIt's always good to check if the solutions actually satisfy the original condition. I'll plug both \\( y \\)-values back into the distance formula.\n\n**Verification for \\( y = -4 \\):**\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(5 - (-3))^2 + (2 - (-4))^2} \\\\\nd = \\sqrt{8^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n\\]\n\n**Verification for \\( y = 8 \\):**\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(5 - (-3))^2 + (2 - 8)^2} \\\\\nd = \\sqrt{8^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\sqrt{100} = 10\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nBoth solutions satisfy the distance condition perfectly. This confirms that \\( y = -4 \\) and \\( y = 8 \\) are indeed correct.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nNow, I need to find the product of these \\( y \\)-coordinates.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Product of \\( y \\)-Coordinates**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nSimply multiply the two \\( y \\)-values obtained.\n\n\\(-4 \\times 8 = -32\\)\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(-4) \\times 8 = -32\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nThe multiplication is straightforward, and the product being negative makes sense given the signs of the numbers involved.\n\n**Next Step:**\n\nFinalize the answer and ensure all parts of the question are addressed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Check and Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nBefore concluding, let's recap the steps to ensure nothing was missed:\n\n1. **Applied the Distance Formula:** Checked out.\n2. **Solved for \\( y \\):** Two valid solutions found.\n3. **Verified Both Solutions:** Both satisfy the distance condition.\n4. **Calculated the Product:** The computation is correct.\n\nEverything seems to align perfectly.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\(<ANSWER>-32</ANSWER>\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nAll steps lead consistently to the product being \\(-32\\). The initial strategy worked without needing to pivot, and verification confirmed the correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and Learning Points**\n\n- **Initial Strategy:** Using the distance formula was effective.\n- **Verification:** Essential to confirm the validity of solutions.\n- **Product Calculation:** Straightforward once solutions were verified.\n- **Final Check:** Ensures that no steps were overlooked.\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically and verifying each step, I ensured the correctness of the solution. Being open to changing strategies and checking work frequently helps in maintaining accuracy.",
