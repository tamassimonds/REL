  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking it through naturally. I'll brainstorm different strategies, reflect often, and check my work along the way to ensure correctness. Let's dive in.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nAlright, we have a cone with a volume of \\(12288\\pi\\) cubic inches and a vertex angle of 60 degrees. We need to find the height of the cone, rounded to the nearest tenth.\n\n**Initial Brainstorm:**\n\n- **Volume Formula:** I remember that the volume of a cone is related to its height and radius. Maybe I can use that to find the height.\n- **Vertex Angle:** The vertex angle of 60 degrees seems important. Perhaps it relates to the cone's dimensions through trigonometry.\n- **Geometry Reflection:** This reminds me of right triangles within the cone's cross-section. Maybe I can use sine, cosine, or tangent.\n\nHonestly, I'm not entirely sure which approach will work best, so I\u2019ll explore a few strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\n#### **Strategy 1: Using the Volume Formula Directly**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I know the volume \\( V \\) of a cone is given by:\n  \\[\n  V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\n  \\]\n  where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\n- **Wait a minute...** I realize I have the volume and need to find the height, but I don't know the radius. I need another equation to relate \\( r \\) and \\( h \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Hmm, this alone isn't enough.** I need to incorporate the vertex angle somehow to relate \\( r \\) and \\( h \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Strategy 1 isn't sufficient on its own.** I need additional information from the vertex angle.\n\n---\n\n#### **Strategy 2: Relating the Vertex Angle to the Cone's Dimensions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Given the vertex angle is 60 degrees, I can visualize a 60-degree angle at the apex of the cone.\n\n- **Oh! I remember,** the vertical cross-section of the cone is an isosceles triangle with a vertex angle of 60 degrees.\n\n- This means each half of the triangle is a **30-60-90 right triangle**.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **This seems promising.** In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratios between the sides are known. I can use these ratios to relate the radius and height.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, because the cross-section being 60 degrees implies the presence of 30-60-90 triangles.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Strategy 2 is valid.** I'll proceed with this.\n\n---\n\n### **Proceeding with Strategy 2**\n\n#### **Step 1: Analyzing the 30-60-90 Triangle**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- In a **30-60-90 triangle**, the ratios of the sides are:\n  - Shortest side (opposite 30\u00b0): \\( x \\)\n  - Hypotenuse: \\( 2x \\)\n  - Longer side (opposite 60\u00b0): \\( x\\sqrt{3} \\)\n\n- **Visualizing this:** The height \\( h \\) of the cone corresponds to the longer side (\\( x\\sqrt{3} \\)), and the radius \\( r \\) corresponds to the shorter side (\\( x \\)).\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Wait, is that correct?** Actually, the height corresponds to the longer side (\\( x\\sqrt{3} \\)), and the radius corresponds to the shorter side (\\( x \\)).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does this align with the triangle ratios?** Yes, it does.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **This setup is correct.**\n\n#### **Step 2: Expressing \\( r \\) in Terms of \\( h \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- From the ratios:\n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}\n  \\]\n\n- **Simplifying this:** To make calculations easier, I can rationalize the denominator:\n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{h \\times \\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{h\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Is this simplification necessary?** It might make plugging into the volume formula cleaner.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does rationalizing help?** Yes, it avoids having a square root in the denominator.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Proceed with the simplified expression for \\( r \\).**\n\n#### **Step 3: Substituting \\( r \\) into the Volume Formula**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Plug \\( r = \\frac{h\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\) into the volume formula:\n  \\[\n  V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{h\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right)^2 h\n  \\]\n\n- **Expanding this:**\n  \\[\n  V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times \\frac{h^2 \\times 3}{9} \\times h = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times \\frac{3h^2}{9} \\times h = \\frac{\\pi h^3}{9}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Let me double-check that expansion.** Yes, squaring \\( \\frac{h\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\) gives \\( \\frac{3h^2}{9} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{h^2}{3} \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Does the formula look correct?** Yes, it simplifies neatly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **The substitution is correct.** Now I have:\n  \\[\n  V = \\frac{\\pi h^3}{9}\n  \\]\n\n#### **Step 4: Solving for \\( h \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Set the volume equal to \\( 12288\\pi \\):\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\pi h^3}{9} = 12288\\pi\n  \\]\n\n- **First instinct:** Divide both sides by \\( \\pi \\) to simplify:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{h^3}{9} = 12288\n  \\]\n\n- **Next step:** Multiply both sides by 9 to isolate \\( h^3 \\):\n  \\[\n  h^3 = 12288 \\times 9 = 110592\n  \\]\n\n- **Finally:** Take the cube root of both sides to solve for \\( h \\):\n  \\[\n  h = \\sqrt[3]{110592}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this process make sense?** Yes, isolating \\( h^3 \\) and then taking the cube root is the correct approach.\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **Quick check with a calculator:** \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt[3]{110592} \\approx 48.0\n  \\]\n\n- **Does this seem realistic?** Yes, a height of 48 inches makes sense for the given volume.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **The calculation is correct.** The height of the cone is approximately **48.0 inches**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER> **48.0 inches** solution</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Checking the Work**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Let\u2019s verify by plugging back:** I can substitute \\( h = 48 \\) back into the volume formula to see if I get \\( 12288\\pi \\).\n\n#### **Step 1: Calculating \\( r \\) with \\( h = 48 \\)**\n\n- From earlier:\n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{48\\sqrt{3}}{3} = 16\\sqrt{3}\n  \\]\n\n#### **Step 2: Plugging into Volume Formula**\n\n- Calculate the volume:\n  \\[\n  V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (16\\sqrt{3})^2 \\times 48\n  \\]\n\n- Expanding:\n  \\[\n  r^2 = (16\\sqrt{3})^2 = 256 \\times 3 = 768\n  \\]\n\n- So:\n  \\[\n  V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times 768 \\times 48 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\times 36864 = 12288\\pi\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does the calculated volume match the given volume?** Yes, it exactly matches \\( 12288\\pi \\).\n\n**Check:**\n\n- **This confirms that the height is correct.** All calculations are consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **The approach was correct, and the final answer is verified.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, reflecting at each step, and verifying the calculations, we confidently arrived at the correct height of the cone. Thinking through the problem naturally, allowing for adjustments along the way, ensured accuracy and a deeper understanding of the geometric relationships involved.\n\n<ANSWER> **48.0 inches** solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The cross section of the cone is an equilateral triangle. The ratio of the base to the height of an equilateral triangle is 1 to $\\sqrt{3}/2$. In terms of the radius, $r$, the base is $2r$ and the height is $2r\\sqrt{3}/2$, or $r\\sqrt{3}$. Since we know the volume of the cone, we can use the volume formula and solve the equation  \\[(1/3) \\times \\pi \\times r^2 \\times r\\sqrt{3} = 12288\\pi\\]  for $r$. Dividing both sides of the equation by $\\pi$ gives  $(1/3)r^3\\sqrt{3} = 12288$. Tripling both sides, we get $r^3\\sqrt{3} = 36,\\!864$. Now, we want $r\\sqrt{3},$ so we multiply both sides by $3$ to get $r^3\\cdot(\\sqrt{3})^3 = (r\\sqrt{3})^3 = 36,\\!864 \\cdot 3 = 110,\\!592.$ Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $r\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{48.0}.$"
