  "solution": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem just like a human would\u2014brainstorming different strategies, reflecting along the way, and being open to changing directions if something doesn't work. I'll start by jotting down my initial thoughts, exploring various approaches, checking my work frequently, and ensuring the final answer makes sense.\n\n---\n\n### First Thoughts\n\nHmm, okay. The question asks how many lattice points lie on the graph of \\( x^2 - y^2 = 47 \\). A **lattice point** means both coordinates are integers. My initial reaction is that this looks similar to problems involving **Diophantine equations**, where we're looking for integer solutions.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure where to start. Maybe I need to brainstorm a few strategies to see which one might work.\n\n---\n\n### Brainstorming Strategies\n\n1. **Factoring the Equation:**  \n   I remember that \\( x^2 - y^2 \\) can be factored as \\( (x - y)(x + y) \\). Maybe factoring could help?\n\n2. **Trying Specific Integer Values:**  \n   Perhaps I could plug in some integer values for \\( x \\) and see if \\( y \\) turns out to be an integer.\n\n3. **Using Modulo Arithmetic:**  \n   Sometimes checking the equation modulo a number can reveal if integer solutions are possible.\n\n4. **Symmetry Considerations:**  \n   Since the equation involves squares, maybe exploiting symmetry could reduce the number of cases to check.\n\nLet's start with the first idea and see where it leads.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Factoring the Equation\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIf I factor the equation as \\( (x - y)(x + y) = 47 \\), maybe I can find integer pairs \\((x, y)\\) that satisfy this.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait a minute, 47 is a prime number. That might limit the possible factorizations. Let me think about how this can help.\n\n**Approach:**  \nSince 47 is prime, the factors of 47 are only \\( \\pm 1 \\) and \\( \\pm 47 \\). So, I can set up equations based on these factors.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1. & \\quad x - y = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x + y = 47 \\\\\n2. & \\quad x - y = -1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x + y = -47 \\\\\n3. & \\quad x - y = 47 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x + y = 1 \\\\\n4. & \\quad x - y = -47 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x + y = -1 \\\\\n5. & \\quad x - y = 47 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x + y = -1 \\\\\n6. & \\quad x - y = -47 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x + y = 1 \\\\\n7. & \\quad x - y = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x + y = -47 \\\\\n8. & \\quad x - y = -1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x + y = 47 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAdding these extra cases makes sense because both \\( x - y \\) and \\( x + y \\) can be negative.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Solving the Systems\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's solve each system to find the corresponding \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n**Checking Each System:**\n\n1. **\\( x - y = 1 \\) and \\( x + y = 47 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   (x - y) + (x + y) &= 1 + 47 \\\\\n   2x &= 48 \\\\\n   x &= 24 \\\\\n   \\text{Substitute } x \\text{ back: } 24 + y &= 47 \\\\\n   y &= 23 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n   **Solution:** \\( (24, 23) \\)\n\n2. **\\( x - y = -1 \\) and \\( x + y = -47 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   2x &= -48 \\\\\n   x &= -24 \\\\\n   -24 + y &= -47 \\\\\n   y &= -23 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n   **Solution:** \\( (-24, -23) \\)\n\n3. **\\( x - y = 47 \\) and \\( x + y = 1 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   2x &= 48 \\\\\n   x &= 24 \\\\\n   24 + y &= 1 \\\\\n   y &= -23 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n   **Solution:** \\( (24, -23) \\)\n\n4. **\\( x - y = -47 \\) and \\( x + y = -1 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   2x &= -48 \\\\\n   x &= -24 \\\\\n   -24 + y &= -1 \\\\\n   y &= 23 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n   **Solution:** \\( (-24, 23) \\)\n\n5. **\\( x - y = 47 \\) and \\( x + y = -1 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   2x &= 46 \\\\\n   x &= 23 \\\\\n   23 + y &= -1 \\\\\n   y &= -24 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n   **Solution:** \\( (23, -24) \\)\n\n6. **\\( x - y = -47 \\) and \\( x + y = 1 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   2x &= -46 \\\\\n   x &= -23 \\\\\n   -23 + y &= 1 \\\\\n   y &= 24 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n   **Solution:** \\( (-23, 24) \\)\n\n7. **\\( x - y = 1 \\) and \\( x + y = -47 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   2x &= -46 \\\\\n   x &= -23 \\\\\n   -23 + y &= -47 \\\\\n   y &= -24 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n   **Solution:** \\( (-23, -24) \\)\n\n8. **\\( x - y = -1 \\) and \\( x + y = 47 \\):**  \n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   2x &= 46 \\\\\n   x &= 23 \\\\\n   23 + y &= 47 \\\\\n   y &= 24 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n   **Solution:** \\( (23, 24) \\)\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Listing All Solutions\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that I've solved all the systems, let's list the solutions:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1. & \\quad (24, 23) \\\\\n2. & \\quad (-24, -23) \\\\\n3. & \\quad (24, -23) \\\\\n4. & \\quad (-24, 23) \\\\\n5. & \\quad (23, -24) \\\\\n6. & \\quad (-23, 24) \\\\\n7. & \\quad (-23, -24) \\\\\n8. & \\quad (23, 24) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, I notice that some points are just negatives of others. Let me see if there's any repetition.\n\n**Checking for Repetition:**\n\n- \\( (24, 23) \\) and \\( (-24, -23) \\) are distinct.\n- \\( (24, -23) \\) and \\( (-24, 23) \\) are distinct.\n- \\( (23, -24) \\) and \\( (-23, 24) \\) are distinct.\n- \\( (-23, -24) \\) and \\( (23, 24) \\) are distinct.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll eight solutions are unique. So, there are **eight** lattice points that satisfy the equation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Solutions\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIt's always good to double-check the solutions to ensure there are no mistakes. Let's plug each pair back into the original equation \\( x^2 - y^2 = 47 \\) and see if they hold.\n\n**Checking Each Solution:**\n\n1. **\\( (24, 23) \\):**  \n   \\[\n   24^2 - 23^2 = 576 - 529 = 47 \\quad \\text{\u2714\ufe0f}\n   \\]\n\n2. **\\( (-24, -23) \\):**  \n   \\[\n   (-24)^2 - (-23)^2 = 576 - 529 = 47 \\quad \\text{\u2714\ufe0f}\n   \\]\n\n3. **\\( (24, -23) \\):**  \n   \\[\n   24^2 - (-23)^2 = 576 - 529 = 47 \\quad \\text{\u2714\ufe0f}\n   \\]\n\n4. **\\( (-24, 23) \\):**  \n   \\[\n   (-24)^2 - 23^2 = 576 - 529 = 47 \\quad \\text{\u2714\ufe0f}\n   \\]\n\n5. **\\( (23, -24) \\):**  \n   \\[\n   23^2 - (-24)^2 = 529 - 576 = -47 \\quad \\text{\u274c}\n   \\]\n\n   **Wait, That Can't Be Right!**  \n   Hmm, this doesn't satisfy the equation. Same for \\( (-23, 24) \\) and their negatives.\n\n6. **\\( (-23, 24) \\):**  \n   \\[\n   (-23)^2 - 24^2 = 529 - 576 = -47 \\quad \\text{\u274c}\n   \\]\n\n7. **\\( (-23, -24) \\):**  \n   \\[\n   (-23)^2 - (-24)^2 = 529 - 576 = -47 \\quad \\text{\u274c}\n   \\]\n\n8. **\\( (23, 24) \\):**  \n   \\[\n   23^2 - 24^2 = 529 - 576 = -47 \\quad \\text{\u274c}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nOh no! Four of the solutions actually satisfy \\( x^2 - y^2 = -47 \\), not 47. This means I need to reconsider my approach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Re-evaluating the Strategy\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nWait a second, the original equation is \\( x^2 - y^2 = 47 \\). But some of the solutions lead to \\( x^2 - y^2 = -47 \\). This suggests that only half of the solutions are valid.\n\n**New Strategy:**  \nInstead of considering all eight systems, focus only on those where \\( x^2 - y^2 = 47 \\).\n\n**Valid Systems:**  \nFrom the original eight, only the first four systems satisfy \\( x^2 - y^2 = 47 \\):\n\n1. \\( x - y = 1 \\) and \\( x + y = 47 \\)\n2. \\( x - y = -1 \\) and \\( x + y = -47 \\)\n3. \\( x - y = 47 \\) and \\( x + y = 1 \\)\n4. \\( x - y = -47 \\) and \\( x + y = -1 \\)\n\n**Invalid Systems:**  \nThe remaining four systems lead to \\( x^2 - y^2 = -47 \\), which does **not** satisfy the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Listing the Correct Solutions\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, let's list only the valid solutions:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1. & \\quad (24, 23) \\\\\n2. & \\quad (-24, -23) \\\\\n3. & \\quad (24, -23) \\\\\n4. & \\quad (-24, 23) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSo, there are **four** lattice points that satisfy \\( x^2 - y^2 = 47 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Final Verification\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLet's double-check these four solutions to ensure they all satisfy the original equation.\n\n**Checking Each Valid Solution:**\n\n1. **\\( (24, 23) \\):**  \n   \\[\n   24^2 - 23^2 = 576 - 529 = 47 \\quad \\text{\u2714\ufe0f}\n   \\]\n\n2. **\\( (-24, -23) \\):**  \n   \\[\n   (-24)^2 - (-23)^2 = 576 - 529 = 47 \\quad \\text{\u2714\ufe0f}\n   \\]\n\n3. **\\( (24, -23) \\):**  \n   \\[\n   24^2 - (-23)^2 = 576 - 529 = 47 \\quad \\text{\u2714\ufe0f}\n   \\]\n\n4. **\\( (-24, 23) \\):**  \n   \\[\n   (-24)^2 - 23^2 = 576 - 529 = 47 \\quad \\text{\u2714\ufe0f}\n   \\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAll four solutions satisfy the original equation. This makes sense because squaring negative numbers yields the same result as squaring their positive counterparts.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative Approach: Modulo Arithmetic\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBefore finalizing the answer, let's briefly consider another strategy to verify that there are no additional solutions. Using **modulo arithmetic** can sometimes reveal constraints on integer solutions.\n\n**Approach:**  \nConsider the equation \\( x^2 - y^2 = 47 \\) modulo small numbers like 4 or 8 to check for possible integer solutions.\n\n**Modulo 4 Analysis:**  \n\\[\nx^2 \\equiv 0 \\text{ or } 1 \\pmod{4} \\\\\ny^2 \\equiv 0 \\text{ or } 1 \\pmod{4} \\\\\nx^2 - y^2 \\equiv 0, 1, \\text{or } -1 \\pmod{4} \\\\\n47 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\\\\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSince \\( x^2 - y^2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\) is **not possible** (because the differences can only be 0, 1, or -1 modulo 4), this doesn't immediately help. But wait, 47 is congruent to 3 modulo 4, which means that \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must be such that their squares differ by 47.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nModulo arithmetic doesn't rule out the solutions we've found but confirms that no other simple solutions exist outside the ones already identified.\n\n**Alternative Approach Verdict:**  \nThis helps reinforce that the four solutions we found are likely the only ones.\n\n---\n\n### Final Check: Is There an Easier Way?\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nLooking back, is there a more straightforward method to arrive at the same conclusion? Maybe considering the symmetry of the equation or using a different factoring approach could simplify the process.\n\n**Symmetry Consideration:**  \nThe equation \\( x^2 - y^2 = 47 \\) is symmetric in both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). This means if \\( (x, y) \\) is a solution, then \\( (-x, -y) \\) is also a solution. This symmetry confirms the four solutions we found.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nUsing symmetry was helpful in verifying that we've captured all possible solutions without missing any.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThere are **four** lattice points that lie on the graph of \\( x^2 - y^2 = 47 \\):  \n\\( (24, 23) \\)  \n\\( (-24, -23) \\)  \n\\( (24, -23) \\)  \n\\( (-24, 23) \\)  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy exploring multiple strategies, reflecting and checking each step, and verifying the final solutions, we've accurately determined the number of lattice points that satisfy the given equation. This approach ensures that no potential solutions are overlooked and that the final answer is correct.",
  "ground_truth": "Applying the difference of squares factorization, we see that any such point satisfies $(x+y)(x-y)=47$.  Both factors are integers.  The only pairs of factors of $47$ are $(47,1)$ and $(-47,-1)$. Thus we have that the coordinates satisfy one of the following four systems: (i) $x+y=47$, $x-y=1$; (ii)  $x+y=-47$, $x-y=-1$; (iii) $x+y=1$, $x-y=47$; (iv) $x+y=-1$, $x-y=-47$.  Solving each of these $4$ systems individually gives exactly one solution in each integers for each system.  Thus there are $\\boxed{4}$ lattice points on the graph."
