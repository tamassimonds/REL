  "problem": "Find all $c$ which satisfy $$\\frac{c}{3} \\le 2+c < -2(1+c).$$Express your answer in interval notation, simplifying any fractions which occur in your answer.",
  "solution": "To solve the compound inequality \\( \\frac{c}{3} \\le 2 + c < -2(1 + c) \\), we will divide it into two parts and solve each inequality separately.\n\n**Step 1: Solve the left inequality \\( \\frac{c}{3} \\le 2 + c \\)**\n\n1. Start with:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{c}{3} \\le 2 + c\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract \\( c \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{c}{3} - c \\le 2\n   \\]\n\n3. To combine the terms, express \\( c \\) as \\( \\frac{3c}{3} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{c}{3} - \\frac{3c}{3} \\le 2\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{2c}{3} \\le 2\n   \\]\n\n4. Multiply both sides by \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\) (remember to reverse the inequality):\n   \\[\n   c \\ge -3\n   \\]\n\n**Step 2: Solve the right inequality \\( 2 + c < -2(1 + c) \\)**\n\n1. Start with:\n   \\[\n   2 + c < -2(1 + c)\n   \\]\n\n2. Expand the right side:\n   \\[\n   2 + c < -2 - 2c\n   \\]\n\n3. Add \\( 2c \\) to both sides:\n   \\[\n   2 + 3c < -2\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract 2 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   3c < -4\n   \\]\n\n5. Divide both sides by 3:\n   \\[\n   c < -\\frac{4}{3}\n   \\]\n\n**Combining Results:**\n\nFrom the first part, we have \\( c \\ge -3 \\). From the second part, we have \\( c < -\\frac{4}{3} \\). \n\nCombining these inequalities gives us:\n\\[\n-3 \\le c < -\\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\nIn interval notation, the solution is expressed as:\n\\[\n[-3, -\\frac{4}{3})\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER> [-3, -\\frac{4}{3}) </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We have two inequalities which $c$ must satisfy. We consider these inequalities one at a time.\n\nThe first inequality is $\\frac{c}{3}\\le 2+c$. Multiplying both sides by $3$, we have $$c\\le 6+3c.$$Subtracting $3c$ from both sides gives $$-2c\\le 6.$$We can divide both sides by $-2$, but we must reverse the inequality since $-2$ is negative. This gives $c\\ge -3$.\n\nThe second inequality is $2+c < -2(1+c)$. Expanding the right side, we have $$2+c < -2-2c.$$Adding $2c-2$ to both sides gives $$3c<-4.$$Dividing both sides by $3$ gives $c<-\\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nSo, all $c$ which satisfy both inequalities are given by $-3\\le c<-\\frac{4}{3}$, or, in interval notation, $c\\in\\boxed{\\left[-3,-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)}$."
