  "solution": "To determine the perimeter of the region bounded by semicircular arcs on each side of a square, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the dimensions of the square**: \n   - The square has a side length of \\( \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the radius of each semicircle**: \n   - Each semicircle is based on one side of the square, which is its diameter: \\( \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\). \n   - The radius \\( r \\) of each semicircle is therefore:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{\\pi} = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the circumference of a full circle**: \n   - The circumference \\( C \\) of a full circle is calculated using the formula \\( C = 2\\pi r \\). \n   - Substituting the radius \\( r \\):\n     \\[\n     C = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\right) = 2\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the length of one semicircular arc**: \n   - Since each semicircle is half of a full circle, the length \\( L \\) of one semicircular arc is:\n     \\[\n     L = \\frac{1}{2} C = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = 1\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total perimeter from all semicircles**: \n   - There are four sides to the square, and thus four semicircles. Therefore, the total perimeter \\( P \\) is:\n     \\[\n     P = 4 \\times L = 4 \\times 1 = 4\n     \\]\n\n6. **Final conclusion**: \n   - The perimeter of the region bounded by the semicircular arcs is:\n     \\[\n     \\boxed{4}\n     \\] \n\nIn summary, the total perimeter of the region is 4.",
  "ground_truth": "Since the square has side length $2/\\pi$,  the diameter of each circular section is $2/\\pi$. The boundary of the region consists of  4 semicircles, whose total perimeter is twice the circumference of a  circle having  diameter $2/\\pi$. Hence the perimeter of the region is \\[\n2\\cdot \\left(\\pi\\cdot \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right) = \\boxed{4}.\n\\]"
