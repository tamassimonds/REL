  "problem": "2 diagonals of a regular heptagon (a 7-sided polygon) are chosen.  What is the probability that they intersect inside the heptagon?",
  "solution": "To determine the probability that two diagonals of a regular heptagon (a polygon with 7 sides) intersect inside the polygon, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Diagonals\n\nThe number of diagonals in a regular polygon with \\( n \\) sides is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\n\\]\nFor a heptagon (\\( n = 7 \\)), the total number of diagonals is:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of diagonals} = \\frac{7(7-3)}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 4}{2} = 14\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Count the Combinations of Diagonals\n\nNext, we find out how many ways we can choose 2 diagonals from the 14 available:\n\\[\n\\binom{14}{2} = \\frac{14 \\times 13}{2} = 91\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine Conditions for Intersection\n\nTwo diagonals intersect inside the heptagon if they are formed from four distinct vertices. To find the number of unique sets of 4 vertices from 7 vertices, we calculate:\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{4} = \\binom{7}{3} = 35\n\\]\nThis signifies that there are 35 ways to choose 4 vertices, and for each choice, there is exactly one way to connect them with two intersecting diagonals.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Probability\n\nThe probability that two randomly chosen diagonals intersect inside the heptagon is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (the intersecting diagonals) to the total outcomes (any two diagonals):\n\\[\nP(\\text{intersecting diagonals}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of ways to choose 4 vertices}}{\\text{Total ways to choose 2 diagonals}} = \\frac{35}{91}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Simplify the Probability\n\nWe can simplify the fraction:\n\\[\n\\frac{35}{91} = \\frac{5}{13}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the probability that two diagonals of a regular heptagon intersect inside the heptagon is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{5}{13}}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{7}{2} = 21$ pairs of points in the heptagon, and all but 7 (the sides of the heptagon) are diagonals, which means there are 14 diagonals.  So there are $\\binom{14}{2} = 91$ pairs of diagonals.  Any four points on the heptagon uniquely determine a pair of intersecting diagonals. (If vertices $A,B,C,D$ are chosen, where $ABCD$ is a convex quadrilateral, the intersecting pair of diagonals are $AC$ and $BD$.)  So the number of sets of intersecting diagonals is the number of combinations of 4 points, which is $\\binom{7}{4} = 35$.  So the probability that a randomly chosen pair of diagonals intersect is $\\dfrac{35}{91} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{13}}$."
