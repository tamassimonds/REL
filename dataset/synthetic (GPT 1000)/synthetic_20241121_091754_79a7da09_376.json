  "problem": "Phil rolls 6 fair 6-sided dice. What is the probability that at least two dice show the same number?",
  "solution": "To find the probability that at least two of Phil's 6 fair 6-sided dice show the same number, we can use the complementary probability approach. Here\u2019s a clear and concise breakdown of the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Outcomes\nWhen rolling 6 dice, each die has 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the total number of different outcomes when rolling all 6 dice is:\n\\[\n6^6 = 46656\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Outcomes for All Different Numbers\nNext, we determine the number of ways in which all 6 dice can show different numbers. Since there are exactly 6 numbers (1 through 6), the only way for all dice to show different results is that each number appears exactly once. The number of ways to arrange these 6 different numbers is given by \\(6!\\) (6 factorial):\n\\[\n6! = 720\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Probability of All Different Numbers\nNow, we can calculate the probability that all 6 dice show different numbers:\n\\[\nP(\\text{all different}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes for all different}}{\\text{Total outcomes}} = \\frac{720}{46656}\n\\]\nThis fraction simplifies to:\n\\[\nP(\\text{all different}) = \\frac{720}{46656} = \\frac{5}{324}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Probability of At Least Two Dice Showing the Same Number\nTo find the probability that at least two dice show the same number, we subtract the probability of all dice showing different numbers from 1:\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least one pair}) = 1 - P(\\text{all different}) = 1 - \\frac{5}{324}\n\\]\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least one pair}) = 1 - \\frac{5}{324} = \\frac{324 - 5}{324} = \\frac{319}{324}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the probability that at least two dice show the same number is:\n\\[\n\\text{FINAL ANSWER: } \\frac{319}{324}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The only way in which there won't be two dice of the same number is if for each number between 1 and 6 there is exactly one die displaying that number. If we line the dice up, there are a total of $6!$ ways in which we could order 6 dice all displaying different numbers and a total of $6^6$ possible outcomes since each of the 6 dice can have 6 outcomes and all of the rolls are determined independently. That means that the probability of all of the dice showing different numbers is $\\dfrac{6!}{6^6}=\\dfrac{5}{324}$, so the probability that we want is $1-\\dfrac{5}{324}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{319}{324}}$."
