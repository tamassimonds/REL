  "problem": "Mark borrows $10$ dollars from Emily with a simple interest rate of $15\\%$ everyday. What is the least integer number of days after which Mark will have to pay her back at least twice as much as he borrowed?",
  "solution": "To determine the minimum number of days after which Mark will owe at least twice the amount he borrowed, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Borrowed Amount**: Mark borrows $10, so we need to find when he will owe at least $20.\n\n2. **Simple Interest Calculation**: We use the formula for simple interest:\n   \\[\n   A = P(1 + rt)\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( A \\) is the total amount owed after \\( t \\) days,\n   - \\( P \\) is the principal amount (initially borrowed),\n   - \\( r \\) is the daily interest rate,\n   - \\( t \\) is the time in days.\n\n3. **Given Values**:\n   - \\( P = 10 \\) dollars,\n   - \\( r = 0.15 \\) (15% expressed as a decimal).\n\n4. **Set Up the Desired Total**: We want to find \\( t \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   10(1 + 0.15t) \\geq 20\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Inequality**:\n   - Divide both sides by 10:\n   \\[\n   1 + 0.15t \\geq 2\n   \\]\n   - Subtract 1 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   0.15t \\geq 1\n   \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 0.15:\n   \\[\n   t \\geq \\frac{1}{0.15}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculating the Time**:\n   \\[\n   t \\geq \\frac{1}{0.15} = \\frac{100}{15} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67\n   \\]\n\n7. **Finding the Least Integer**: Since \\( t \\) must be a whole number, we round up 6.67 to the next integer, which is 7.\n\nIn conclusion, the least integer number of days after which Mark will need to repay at least twice the amount he borrowed is 7.\n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>7 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since the interest rate is simple, he has to pay an interest of $10 \\cdot 0.15 =1.5$ dollars every day.\n\nLet $x$ be the number of days needed to repay at least double the amount borrowed. Since he has to repay $10 as well as $\\$1.5x$ in interest, we have the inequality $10+1.5x \\ge 10 \\cdot 2$. Solving for $x$, we get $x \\ge 6.\\overline{6}$. The smallest integer greater than $6.\\overline{6}$ is $7$. Therefore, it would take at least $\\boxed{7 \\text{ days}}$."
