  "problem": "Given that the point $(4,7)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, there is one point that must be on the graph of $2y=3f(4x)+5$. What is the sum of the coordinates of that point?",
  "solution": "We begin with the point \\((4, 7)\\) on the graph of \\(y = f(x)\\), which indicates that \\(f(4) = 7\\).\n\nNext, we need to convert the function into the form of the new equation \\(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\\). By rewriting it, we find:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{3f(4x) + 5}{2}.\n\\]\n\nTo identify a specific point on this new graph, we can select \\(x = 1\\) so that \\(4x = 4\\):\n\n\\[\n4 \\cdot 1 = 4.\n\\]\n\nWe substitute \\(x = 1\\) into our rewritten equation:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{3f(4)}{2} + \\frac{5}{2}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the known result \\(f(4) = 7\\), we substitute this value:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{3 \\cdot 7 + 5}{2} = \\frac{21 + 5}{2} = \\frac{26}{2} = 13.\n\\]\n\nThus, when \\(x = 1\\), the corresponding \\(y\\) value is \\(13\\). Therefore, the point \\((1, 13)\\) lies on the graph of \\(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\\).\n\nFinally, we calculate the sum of the coordinates of the point \\((1, 13)\\):\n\n\\[\n1 + 13 = 14.\n\\]\n\nConsequently, the answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>14</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since $(4,7)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we know  \\[7=f(4).\\]Using that $f(4\\cdot1)=7$, we can also say \\[3f(4\\cdot1)+5=3\\cdot7+5=26=2\\cdot13.\\]Therefore $(x,y)=(1,13)$ is on the graph of  \\[2y=3f(4\\cdot x)+5.\\]The sum of these coordinates is $1+13=\\boxed{14}$."
