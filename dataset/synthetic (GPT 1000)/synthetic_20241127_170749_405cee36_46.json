  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were tackling this on paper, exploring different strategies, reflecting, and checking my work along the way.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nOkay, so we have two parabolas defined by the equations:\n\n\\[ \ny = 2x^2 - 7x + 1 \n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \ny = 8x^2 + 5x + 1 \n\\]\n\nWe need to find all their intersection points and list them in order of increasing \\( x \\)-coordinates.\n\n**First Reaction:**  \nThis reminds me of problems where we need to find where two curves intersect. Usually, this involves setting the equations equal to each other since at the intersection points, both \\( y \\)-values are the same for the same \\( x \\). But let me brainstorm a bit to see if there are other strategies that might work.\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Set the Equations Equal:**  \n   Intuitively, setting the two equations equal to each other to solve for \\( x \\) seems straightforward. This would give us the \\( x \\)-coordinates of the intersection points, and then we can plug back in to find the corresponding \\( y \\)-coordinates.\n\n2. **Graphical Approach:**  \n   Visualizing the graphs might help to estimate the number of intersection points and their approximate locations. But since we need exact points, this would only serve as a sanity check.\n\n3. **Substitution or Elimination:**  \n   Similar to solving systems of linear equations, but since these are quadratics, substitution might lead back to setting them equal.\n\n4. **Numerical Methods:**  \n   Methods like the Newton-Raphson could be used for finding roots, but that's more involved and not necessary unless the algebraic approach fails.\n\n**Which to Try First?**  \nI think starting with setting the equations equal is the most direct approach. If that leads to a manageable equation, great! If not, I can reconsider.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting the Equations Equal**\n\nLet's set the two equations equal to find the \\( x \\)-coordinates where they intersect:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 7x + 1 = 8x^2 + 5x + 1\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBy doing this, we're essentially finding the \\( x \\)-values where the two parabolas have the same \\( y \\)-value. This should give us a quadratic equation to solve.\n\n**Wait a Minute...**  \nBefore proceeding, I notice that both sides have a \\( +1 \\). Maybe I can simplify this equation right away by subtracting 1 from both sides.\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 7x + 1 - 1 = 8x^2 + 5x + 1 - 1\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 7x = 8x^2 + 5x\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nYeah, that makes the equation cleaner. Always good to simplify early on to avoid unnecessary complexity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Bringing All Terms to One Side**\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 7x - 8x^2 - 5x = 0\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying:**  \nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n(2x^2 - 8x^2) + (-7x - 5x) = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-6x^2 - 12x = 0\n\\]\n\n**Check:**  \nDoes this look right?  \n\\( 2x^2 - 8x^2 = -6x^2 \\) and  \n\\( -7x - 5x = -12x \\)  \nYep, that seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Factoring the Equation**\n\nNow, let's factor out the common terms:\n\n\\[\n-6x^2 - 12x = 0\n\\]\n\n**Factoring Out \\( -6x \\):**\n\n\\[\n-6x(x + 2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nBy factoring out \\( -6x \\), we've broken it down into two simpler factors. This makes it easier to find the roots.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nWait, does factoring make sense here? Yes, because setting each factor to zero will give us the potential \\( x \\)-values where the intersection occurs.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Solving for \\( x \\)**\n\nSet each factor equal to zero:\n\n1. \\(-6x = 0\\)  \n   \\[\n   x = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. \\(x + 2 = 0\\)  \n   \\[\n   x = -2\n   \\]\n\n**Check:**  \nSo, we have two \\( x \\)-values: \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). Does this make sense?  \nSince we started with a quadratic equation, having two solutions is expected.  \n\n**Wait a Second...**  \nInitially, I only considered positive \\( x \\)-values, but seeing \\( x = -2 \\) reminds me that intersections can occur on both sides of the origin. It's always good to keep an open mind about the possible solutions.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finding Corresponding \\( y \\)-Coordinates**\n\nNow, let's find the \\( y \\)-coordinates for each \\( x \\)-value by plugging them back into either of the original equations. I'll choose the first equation \\( y = 2x^2 - 7x + 1 \\) for simplicity, but it should work with either.\n\n**For \\( x = 0 \\):**\n\n\\[\ny = 2(0)^2 - 7(0) + 1 = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the point is \\( (0, 1) \\).\n\n**For \\( x = -2 \\):**\n\n\\[\ny = 2(-2)^2 - 7(-2) + 1\n\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n\\[\n= 2(4) + 14 + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 8 + 14 + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 23\n\\]\n\nSo, the point is \\( (-2, 23) \\).\n\n**Check:**  \nLet me plug \\( x = -2 \\) into the second equation to verify:\n\n\\[\ny = 8(-2)^2 + 5(-2) + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 8(4) - 10 + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 32 - 10 + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n= 23\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth equations give \\( y = 23 \\) when \\( x = -2 \\), so our solution is consistent. It's always a good practice to verify by plugging back into both equations.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Listing the Intersection Points**\n\nWe have found two intersection points:\n\n\\[\n(-2, 23) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (0, 1)\n\\]\n\nListing them in order of increasing \\( x \\)-coordinate:\n\n\\[\n(-2, 23); (0, 1)\n\\]\n\n**Final Check:**  \nDoes this make sense?  \n- We found two distinct intersection points, which aligns with the fact that we're dealing with two parabolas.  \n- Both points satisfy both equations, so our solutions are valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\n**Alternative Strategies Recap:**  \n- Setting the equations equal worked well here.  \n- A graphical approach could have provided a visual confirmation, but wasn't necessary for exact solutions.  \n- Numerical methods weren't needed since the algebraic solution was straightforward.\n\n**Reflection on the Process:**  \n- Starting with setting the equations equal was the right choice.  \n- Simplifying the equation early made factoring easier.  \n- Verifying solutions by plugging back into both equations ensured correctness.\n\n**Human-Like Checking:**  \n- Initial uncertainty about the number of intersection points was clarified through factoring.  \n- Consistently checking each step helped catch potential errors before proceeding.  \n- Verifying solutions reinforced confidence in the final answer.\n\n<ANSWER> \n\n\\[\n(-2, 23); (0, 1)\n\\]\n\n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nI hope this step-by-step walkthrough reflects a natural human thinking process, complete with brainstorming, checking, and reflecting at each stage!",
  "ground_truth": "First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-7x+1=8x^2+5x+1$. Combine like terms to get $6x^2+12x=0$. Then, we can divide by $6$ to get $x^2+2x=0$. To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{2}\\right)^2=1$ to both sides, giving $(x+1)^2=1$.\n\nSo we have $x+1=\\pm1$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $0$. Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-2, 23)}$ and $\\boxed{(0, 1)}$."
