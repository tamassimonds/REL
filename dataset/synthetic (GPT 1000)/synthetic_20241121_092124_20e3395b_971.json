  "problem": "Call an integer $n$ oddly powerful if there exist positive integers $a$ and $b$, where $b>1$, $b$ is odd, and $a^b = n$. How many oddly powerful integers are less than $2010$?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of oddly powerful integers less than 2010, we define an oddly powerful integer \\( n \\) as one that can be expressed in the form \\( a^b \\), where \\( a \\) is a positive integer, and \\( b \\) is an odd integer greater than 1.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Odd Powers**: The odd integers greater than 1 to consider for \\( b \\) are \\( 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, \\ldots \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Values of \\( a^b \\)**: For each odd \\( b \\), we compute \\( a^b \\) for small values of \\( a \\) until the results exceed 2010.\n\n### Calculations by Value of \\( b \\):\n\n- **For \\( b = 3 \\)**:\n  - Valid results: \\( 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1331, 1728 \\)\n\n- **For \\( b = 5 \\)**:\n  - Valid results: \\( 1, 32, 243, 1024 \\)\n\n- **For \\( b = 7 \\)**:\n  - Valid results: \\( 1, 128 \\)\n\n- **For \\( b = 9 \\)**:\n  - Valid results: \\( 1, 512 \\)\n\n- **For \\( b = 11 \\)**:\n  - Valid results: \\( 1 \\)\n\n### Compile and Count Unique Results:\n\nCombining all unique results from the above calculations:\n\n- From \\( b = 3 \\): \\( 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1331, 1728 \\)\n- From \\( b = 5 \\): \\( 1, 32, 243, 1024 \\)\n- From \\( b = 7 \\): \\( 1, 128 \\)\n- From \\( b = 9 \\): \\( 1, 512 \\)\n- From \\( b = 11 \\): \\( 1 \\)\n\n### Unique Oddly Powerful Integers:\nAfter gathering all unique integers, we find the following values below 2010:\n\n\\( 1, 8, 27, 32, 64, 125, 128, 216, 243, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1024, 1331, 1728 \\)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere are **16 unique oddly powerful integers** less than 2010.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<ANSWER>16 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let us first determine the number of cubes that are less than $2010$. We have $10^3 = 1000$, $11^3 = 1331$, and $12^3 = 1728$, but $13^3 = 2197$. So there are $12$ cubes less than $2010$. As for fifth powers, $4^5 = 1024$, but $5^5 = 3125$. There are $4$ fifth powers less than $2010$, but only $3$ of these have not already been included, since we've already counted 1. Analyzing seventh powers, $3^7 = 2187$, so the only new seventh power less than $2010$ is $2^7$. There are no new ninth powers since they are all cubes, and $2^{11} = 2048$ is greater than 2010. Therefore, there are $12+3+1 = \\boxed{16}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$."
