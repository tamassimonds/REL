  "solution": "To solve the problem, we start with the following equations:\n\n1. \\( a^5 = b^4 \\)\n2. \\( c^3 = d^2 \\)\n3. \\( c - a = 19 \\)\n\n### Step 1: Relate \\( b \\) to \\( a \\)\n\nFrom the first equation \\( a^5 = b^4 \\), we can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n\n\\[\nb = a^{5/4}\n\\]\n\nTo ensure \\( b \\) is an integer (since both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers), we can set \\( a \\) to be a perfect fourth power. Let \\( a = k^4 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Then:\n\n\\[\na^5 = (k^4)^5 = k^{20} \\Rightarrow b^4 = k^{20} \\implies b = k^5\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Relate \\( c \\) to \\( d \\)\n\nFor the second equation \\( c^3 = d^2 \\), we can express \\( c \\) as a perfect square by setting \\( c = m^2 \\) for some integer \\( m \\), leading to:\n\n\\[\nc^3 = (m^2)^3 = m^6 \\Rightarrow d^2 = m^6 \\implies d = m^3\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Connect \\( c \\) and \\( a \\)\n\nNext, we combine what we have with the relationship from the third equation \\( c - a = 19 \\):\n\n\\[\nm^2 - k^4 = 19\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for integers \\( m \\) and \\( k \\)\n\nWe need to find integers \\( m \\) and \\( k \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nm^2 = k^4 + 19\n\\]\n\nWe test various integer values for \\( k \\) to see if \\( m^2 \\) results in a perfect square.\n\n1. **For \\( k = 1 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   m^2 = 1^4 + 19 = 20 \\quad (\\text{not a perfect square})\n   \\]\n\n2. **For \\( k = 2 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   m^2 = 2^4 + 19 = 35 \\quad (\\text{not a perfect square})\n   \\]\n\n3. **For \\( k = 3 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   m^2 = 3^4 + 19 = 100 \\quad (m = 10)\n   \\]\n\nThis works, as \\( 100 = 10^2 \\). Thus, we have \\( k = 3 \\) and \\( m = 10 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Calculate \\( a, b, c, d \\)\n\nNow, substituting \\( k = 3 \\) and \\( m = 10 \\):\n\n\\[\na = k^4 = 3^4 = 81\n\\]\n\\[\nb = k^5 = 3^5 = 243\n\\]\n\nAnd for \\( m \\):\n\n\\[\nc = m^2 = 10^2 = 100\n\\]\n\\[\nd = m^3 = 10^3 = 1000\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Find \\( d - b \\)\n\nFinally, we calculate \\( d - b \\):\n\n\\[\nd - b = 1000 - 243 = 757\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{757}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "It follows from the givens that $a$ is a perfect fourth power, $b$ is a perfect fifth power, $c$ is a perfect square and $d$ is a perfect cube. Thus, there exist integers $s$ and $t$ such that $a = t^4$, $b = t^5$, $c = s^2$ and $d = s^3$. So $s^2 - t^4 = 19$. We can factor the left-hand side of this equation as a difference of two squares, $(s - t^2)(s + t^2) = 19$. 19 is a prime number and $s + t^2 > s - t^2$ so we must have $s + t^2 = 19$ and $s - t^2 = 1$. Then $s = 10, t = 3$ and so $d = s^3 = 1000$, $b = t^5 = 243$ and $d-b=\\boxed{757}$."
