  "problem": "The first term of a geometric sequence is 729, and the 7th term is 64. What is the positive, real value for the 5th term?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem using the properties of a geometric sequence, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Definition**: A geometric sequence has terms defined by the formula:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}\n   \\]\n   where \\(a_n\\) is the \\(n\\)-th term, \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(r\\) is the common ratio, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n2. **Given Values**: \n   - First term, \\(a_1 = 729\\)\n   - Seventh term, \\(a_7 = 64\\)\n\n3. **Express the Seventh Term**: Using the formula:\n   \\[\n   a_7 = a_1 \\cdot r^{6}\n   \\]\n   Substituting known values:\n   \\[\n   64 = 729 \\cdot r^6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(r^6\\)**: Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   r^6 = \\frac{64}{729}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify**: Recognizing that \\(64\\) and \\(729\\) can be expressed as powers:\n   \\[\n   r^6 = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^6\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find \\(r\\)**: Taking the sixth root:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{2}{3}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Find the Fifth Term \\(a_5\\)**: Using the formula for the \\(5\\)-th term:\n   \\[\n   a_5 = a_1 \\cdot r^4\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   a_5 = 729 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4\n   \\]\n\n8. **Calculate \\(r^4\\)**: \n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 = \\frac{16}{81}\n   \\]\n\n9. **Substitute to Find \\(a_5\\)**:\n   \\[\n   a_5 = 729 \\cdot \\frac{16}{81}\n   \\]\n\n10. **Simplify**: Calculate:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{729}{81} = 9\n    \\]\n    Hence:\n    \\[\n    a_5 = 9 \\cdot 16 = 144\n    \\]\n\n11. **Final Answer**: \nTherefore, the value of the 5th term is:\n\\[\n\\text{<ANSWER> 144 </ANSWER>}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The only positive, real common ratio for this sequence is $\\frac{2}{3}$.  Thus, if $x$ is the 5th term, then $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 x = 64$, so $x = \\boxed{144}.$"
