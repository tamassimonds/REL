  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just like I would if I were solving it naturally. I'll walk through my thought process, brainstorm different strategies, reflect on their effectiveness, and make adjustments as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nOkay, the question asks for the greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\(4T_n\\) and \\(n-1\\) for all positive integers \\(n\\). Here, \\(T_n\\) represents the \\(n\\)th triangular number, defined as \\(T_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + n\\).\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n- Triangular numbers... I remember they're sums of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers.\n- GCD problems typically involve finding common factors, so maybe factoring \\(4T_n\\) and \\(n-1\\) could be useful.\n- I recall there's a formula for triangular numbers. Using that might simplify things.\n\nBut wait, let's ensure I fully grasp what's being asked:\n- I need to find the maximum GCD between \\(4T_n\\) and \\(n-1\\) across all positive integers \\(n\\).\n- So it's about determining the greatest GCD value possible for any \\(n\\), not just a specific case.\n\n### **Exploring Strategies**\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n1. **Use the Formula for Triangular Numbers:**\n   - Recall that \\(T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\).\n   - So, \\(4T_n = 2n(n+1)\\).\n   - Expressing \\(4T_n\\) in terms of \\(n\\) and \\(n+1\\) might reveal common factors with \\(n-1\\).\n\n2. **Factorizing \\(4T_n\\) and \\(n-1\\):**\n   - Perhaps factoring both expressions can expose common divisors.\n\n3. **Applying the Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   - The Euclidean algorithm is effective for finding GCDs. Maybe setting up an equation to apply it here would work.\n\n4. **Testing Small Values of \\(n\\):**\n   - Checking small cases can often provide insights or patterns.\n\n**Which Strategy to Start With?**\n- I'll kick off with using the formula for triangular numbers since it directly relates to \\(T_n\\). If that path doesn't lead anywhere, I can pivot to factoring or testing small cases.\n\n### **Step 1: Using the Formula for Triangular Numbers**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's express \\(T_n\\) using its formula to see how \\(4T_n\\) unfolds.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\nT_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n4T_n = 4 \\times \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 2n(n+1)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Now, \\(4T_n = 2n(n+1)\\). This means \\(4T_n\\) is the product of \\(2\\), \\(n\\), and \\(n+1\\).\n- Since \\(n\\), \\(n+1\\), and \\(n-1\\) are consecutive integers, there might be inherent factors to exploit.\n\n**Does This Help?**\n- It seems promising because of the relationship between consecutive integers. There might be overlapping factors we can use.\n\n### **Step 2: Factoring \\(4T_n\\) and Analyzing \\(n-1\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's factor \\(4T_n\\) and see how it relates to \\(n-1\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n4T_n = 2n(n+1)\n\\]\n\\[\nn-1 = n-1\n\\]\n\n- So, \\(4T_n\\) is the product of \\(2\\), \\(n\\), and \\(n+1\\).\n- We need to find the GCD of \\(2n(n+1)\\) and \\(n-1\\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Given that \\(n\\) and \\(n+1\\) are consecutive integers, their product is always even, making \\(4T_n\\) divisible by 2.\n- However, \\(n-1\\) could be even or odd depending on \\(n\\).\n- Perhaps factoring \\(n-1\\) and checking for shared factors with \\(2n(n+1)\\) would help.\n\n**Does This Lead Anywhere?**\n- Not immediately clear. It might be better to explore another angle.\n\n### **Step 3: Applying the Euclidean Algorithm**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- The Euclidean algorithm is a robust tool for finding GCDs. Let's see if it can be applied here.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Recall that the GCD of two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is the same as the GCD of \\(b\\) and \\(a \\mod b\\).\n- Let's set \\(a = 4T_n = 2n(n+1)\\) and \\(b = n-1\\).\n\nFirst, compute \\(a \\mod b\\):\n\\[\n2n(n+1) \\mod (n-1)\n\\]\n\n**Wait a Minute...**\n- Computing this directly seems tricky. Perhaps expanding and simplifying it would help.\n\n**Let's Think:**\n- \\(n(n+1)\\) is \\(n^2 + n\\).\n- So, \\(2n(n+1) = 2n^2 + 2n\\).\n- I need to find \\((2n^2 + 2n) \\mod (n-1)\\).\n\n**But Wait, That Seems Complicated...**\n- Maybe there's an easier approach. Testing small values of \\(n\\) might reveal a pattern.\n\n### **Step 4: Testing Small Values of \\(n\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's calculate \\(4T_n\\) and \\(n-1\\) for small \\(n\\) to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **For \\(n = 2\\):**\n  \\[\n  T_2 = 1 + 2 = 3,\\quad 4T_2 = 12,\\quad n-1 = 1\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{GCD}(12, 1) = 1\n  \\]\n\n- **For \\(n = 3\\):**\n  \\[\n  T_3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6,\\quad 4T_3 = 24,\\quad n-1 = 2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{GCD}(24, 2) = 2\n  \\]\n\n- **For \\(n = 4\\):**\n  \\[\n  T_4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10,\\quad 4T_4 = 40,\\quad n-1 = 3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{GCD}(40, 3) = 1\n  \\]\n\n- **For \\(n = 5\\):**\n  \\[\n  T_5 = 15,\\quad 4T_5 = 60,\\quad n-1 = 4\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{GCD}(60, 4) = 4\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Interesting. The GCD values are \\(1, 2, 1, 4\\) for \\(n = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) respectively.\n- It appears that the GCD can exceed 1 and even reach 4, as seen in the case of \\(n = 5\\).\n- This suggests that the GCD's magnitude depends on specific properties of \\(n\\).\n\n**Does This Help?**\n- Yes, testing small values indicates that the GCD can vary and reach up to 4. However, I need to confirm if 4 is indeed the maximum possible GCD.\n\n### **Step 5: Looking for Patterns and Generalizing**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- From the samples, it seems that when \\(n-1\\) divides \\(2n(n+1)\\) more cleanly, the GCD is larger.\n- Maybe there's a condition on \\(n\\) that maximizes the GCD.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Perhaps \\(n-1\\) needs to be a factor of both \\(n\\) and \\(n+1\\).\n- Since \\(n\\) and \\(n+1\\) are consecutive, their GCD with \\(n-1\\) might impose certain constraints.\n\n**But Wait...**\n- It might be more straightforward to analyze the factors of \\(4T_n\\) relative to \\(n-1\\).\n\n### **Step 6: Analyzing the Factors**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's factor \\(4T_n\\) as \\(2n(n+1)\\) and see how it relates to \\(n-1\\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- \\(4T_n = 2n(n+1)\\)\n- \\(n-1 = n-1\\)\n\n- Notice that:\n  \\[\n  n(n+1) = n^2 + n\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  n^2 + n = (n-1)(n+1) + 2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\Rightarrow n(n+1) = (n-1)(n+1) + 2\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\Rightarrow 2n(n+1) = 2(n-1)(n+1) + 4\n  \\]\n  \n- So,\n  \\[\n  4T_n = 2(n-1)(n+1) + 4\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- This expression reveals that \\(4T_n\\) is closely related to \\(n-1\\) and \\(n+1\\).\n- Perhaps this can aid in applying the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n**Does This Lead Anywhere?**\n- Yes, it suggests that the remainder when \\(4T_n\\) is divided by \\(n-1\\) is 4, which is a valuable insight.\n\n### **Step 7: Applying the Euclidean Algorithm Again**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Using the previous result, the Euclidean algorithm can be applied more straightforwardly.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- Let \\(a = 4T_n = 2n(n+1)\\) and \\(b = n-1\\).\n- According to the Euclidean algorithm:\n  \\[\n  \\text{GCD}(a, b) = \\text{GCD}(b, a \\mod b)\n  \\]\n  \n- From Step 6:\n  \\[\n  4T_n = 2(n-1)(n+1) + 4\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\Rightarrow a \\mod b = 4\n  \\]\n  \n- Therefore:\n  \\[\n  \\text{GCD}(4T_n, n-1) = \\text{GCD}(n-1, 4)\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection:**\n- This simplification is significant! The GCD of \\(4T_n\\) and \\(n-1\\) reduces to the GCD of \\(n-1\\) and 4.\n- Consequently, the greatest possible GCD depends on the factors of \\(n-1\\) relative to 4.\n\n**Does This Help?**\n- Absolutely! It transforms the problem into determining when \\(n-1\\) is a multiple of 4, which maximizes the GCD.\n\n### **Step 8: Determining the Greatest Possible GCD**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Since \\(\\text{GCD}(n-1, 4)\\) can be at most 4 (as 4 is the largest factor of itself), the greatest possible GCD is 4.\n- This maximum GCD occurs when \\(n-1\\) is a multiple of 4.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- If \\(n-1\\) is a multiple of 4, say \\(n-1 = 4k\\) for some integer \\(k\\), then:\n  \\[\n  \\text{GCD}(4T_n, n-1) = \\text{GCD}(4T_n, 4k) = 4\n  \\]\n  \n- Therefore, the greatest possible value of the GCD is 4.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This conclusion aligns with the earlier test case where \\(n = 5\\) (\\(n-1 = 4\\)), and the GCD was 4.\n- It seems consistent, but verifying with another example would ensure correctness.\n\n**Does This Confirm the Solution?**\n- Yes, but let's double-check with another value where \\(n-1\\) is a multiple of 4 to be certain.\n\n### **Step 9: Verifying with Another Example**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's test \\(n = 9\\) (\\(n-1 = 8\\), which is a multiple of 4) to see if the GCD is 4.\n\n**Calculations:**\n- \\(T_9 = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 9 = 45\\)\n- \\(4T_9 = 180\\)\n- \\(n-1 = 8\\)\n- \\(\\text{GCD}(180, 8) = 4\\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Indeed, the GCD is 4, confirming our conclusion.\n\n**Does This Validate the Solution?**\n- Absolutely! Multiple test cases support that the greatest possible GCD is 4.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<ANSWER>The greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor of \\(4T_n\\) and \\(n-1\\) is \\(4\\).</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Initial Approach:**  \n  Starting with the formula for triangular numbers provided a clear path to expressing \\(4T_n\\) in terms of \\(n\\) and \\(n+1\\).\n\n- **Testing Small Cases:**  \n  Verifying with small \\(n\\) values helped identify that the GCD can reach up to 4, guiding the subsequent steps.\n\n- **Application of the Euclidean Algorithm:**  \n  Simplifying the GCD problem using the Euclidean algorithm was a pivotal move, reducing the complexity and making the solution evident.\n\n- **Verification:**  \n  Testing additional examples where \\(n-1\\) is a multiple of 4 ensured the solution's validity.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The greatest possible GCD is 4, occurring when \\(n-1\\) is a multiple of 4.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy systematically exploring different strategies, reflecting on their effectiveness, and validating through examples, we confidently arrived at the correct solution. This approach ensures not only accuracy but also a deeper understanding of the problem at hand.",
  "ground_truth": "By the arithmetic series formula, $T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, so $4T_n = 2n(n+1) = 2n^2 + 2n$. By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\\text{gcd}\\,(2n^2 + 2n, n-1) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(2n^2 + 2n - (n-1) \\times 2n, n-1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4n, n - 1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4n - 4(n-1) , n-1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4, n -1) \\le \\boxed{4}.\\end{align*} For example, this is true for $n = 5$."
