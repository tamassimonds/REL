  "solution": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, checking along the way, and being open to changing directions if needed.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see the problem with four variables and four equations, it reminds me of systems of linear equations. My initial instinct is to think about using substitution or elimination methods to solve for the variables individually. But then I notice that the question asks for \\( wx + yz \\), not the individual values of \\( w, x, y, \\) and \\( z \\). This makes me wonder if there's a more straightforward approach that doesn't require solving for each variable explicitly.\n\n**Initial Brainstorming:**\n- **Method 1:** Solve for each variable using substitution or elimination, then compute \\( wx + yz \\).\n- **Method 2:** Look for patterns or relationships between the equations that can directly lead to \\( wx + yz \\) without solving for all variables.\n- **Method 3:** Consider adding or subtracting equations to isolate expressions involving \\( wx + yz \\).\n\nI think I'll start with **Method 2**, looking for patterns, because it might save time by avoiding solving for each variable individually. If that doesn't work, I can always fall back on **Method 1**.\n\n---\n\n### **Exploring Method 2: Looking for Patterns**\n\nLet me look at the given equations again:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1) & \\quad w + x + y = -2, \\\\\n2) & \\quad w + x + z = 4, \\\\\n3) & \\quad w + y + z = 19, \\\\\n4) & \\quad x + y + z = 12.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Thoughts:**\n- Each equation involves three out of the four variables.\n- Maybe I can add or subtract equations to eliminate variables and find relations involving \\( wx + yz \\).\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Try adding all four equations together to see if any variables cancel out or if I can find a total sum that helps.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\\[\n(w + x + y) + (w + x + z) + (w + y + z) + (x + y + z) = -2 + 4 + 19 + 12\n\\]\n\nLeft side:\n\\[\n3w + 3x + 3y + 3z\n\\]\nRight side:\n\\[\n33\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[\n3(w + x + y + z) = 33 \\implies w + x + y + z = 11\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This gives me the sum of all four variables. Might be useful, but I'm not sure yet how it directly relates to \\( wx + yz \\).\n\n**Next Step:**\n- Maybe subtract this total from the individual equations to find expressions for each variable in terms of others.\n\n---\n\n### **Attempting to Isolate Variables**\n\n**Idea:**\n- Subtract each of the original equations from \\( w + x + y + z = 11 \\) to find individual variables' sums.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. Subtracting Equation 1 from the total:\n   \\[\n   (w + x + y + z) - (w + x + y) = 11 - (-2) \\implies z = 13\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtracting Equation 2 from the total:\n   \\[\n   (w + x + y + z) - (w + x + z) = 11 - 4 \\implies y = 7\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtracting Equation 3 from the total:\n   \\[\n   (w + x + y + z) - (w + y + z) = 11 - 19 \\implies x = -8\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtracting Equation 4 from the total:\n   \\[\n   (w + x + y + z) - (x + y + z) = 11 - 12 \\implies w = -1\n   \\]\n\n**Quick Check:**\n- Let's verify one of the original equations to see if these values make sense.\n\nUsing Equation 1:\n\\[\nw + x + y = -1 + (-8) + 7 = -2\n\\]\n- Matches the given equation. That's a good sign!\n\n**Reflection:**\n- It seems like isolating the variables worked smoothly. Now I have:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nw &= -1, \\\\\nx &= -8, \\\\\ny &= 7, \\\\\nz &= 13.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Next Step:**\n- Calculate \\( wx + yz \\) using these values.\n\n---\n\n### **Calculating \\( wx + yz \\)**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nwx &= (-1) \\times (-8) = 8, \\\\\nyz &= 7 \\times 13 = 91, \\\\\nwx + yz &= 8 + 91 = 99.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Check:**\n- The calculations seem straightforward, but let's do a quick sanity check:\n\n\\[\nwx = (-1) \\times (-8) = 8 \\quad \\text{(positive times negative is positive)}\n\\]\n\\[\nyz = 7 \\times 13 = 91 \\quad \\text{(positive times positive is positive)}\n\\]\n\\[\nwx + yz = 8 + 91 = 99 \\quad \\text{(adds up correctly)}\n\\]\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Method 2** worked well here. By adding all the equations, I found the total sum of all variables, which allowed me to easily isolate each variable.\n  \n- This approach was efficient because it avoided the need for solving a system of equations step-by-step for each variable individually.\n\n- **Alternative Thought:** Initially, I considered **Method 1** (solving each variable), but recognizing that the problem asked for a specific sum involving products, **Method 2** became more appealing.\n\n- **Checking the Work:** Verifying one of the original equations with the obtained values provided confidence that the solution is correct.\n\n- **Potential Mistake Avoided:** If I had tried to solve for \\( wx + yz \\) directly without isolating variables, it might have been more complex. By simplifying the system first, the calculation became straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nThe value of \\( wx + yz \\) is \\( \\boxed{99} \\).  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\nThat's it! By starting with an open mind, brainstorming different strategies, and being ready to adjust my approach, I was able to efficiently solve the problem. Checking each step along the way ensured that the solution was correct.",
  "ground_truth": "Adding all four equations together results in $3w+3x+3y+3z = 33 \\Rightarrow w+x+y+z = 11$. Subtracting the four original equations from this sum gives: $z = 11-(-2) = 13$, $y = 11-4 = 7$, $x = 11-19 = -8$, and $w = 11-12 = -1$, respectively. Therefore, $wx + yz = -1\\cdot-8 + 7\\cdot13 = 8+91 = \\boxed{99}$"
