  "problem": "Consider the set of 30 parabolas defined as follows: all parabolas have as focus the point $(0,0)$ and the directrix lines have the form $y=ax+b$ with $a$ and $b$ integers such that $a\\in \\{-2,-1,0,1,2\\}$ and $b\\in \\{-3,-2,-1,1,2,3\\}$. No three of these parabolas have a common point. How many points in the plane are on two of these parabolas?",
  "solution": "To find the number of intersection points in the plane for pairs of parabolas defined by a common focus at \\((0, 0)\\) and varying directrices of the form \\(y = ax + b\\), we proceed with the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Count the Number of Parabolas\nWe start by determining the potential values for the coefficients of the directrix:\n- The slope \\(a\\) can take on the values: \\(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\) (5 possible values).\n- The intercept \\(b\\) can take on the values: \\(-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3\\) (6 possible values).\n\nThus, the total number of distinct parabolas formed is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 6 = 30\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine Conditions for Intersections\nNext, we examine the conditions under which two parabolas intersect:\n- If the slopes \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) are different, that is, \\(a_1 \\neq a_2\\), the parabolas will intersect.\n- If the slopes are the same (\\(a_1 = a_2\\)), the directrices must differ (\\(b_1 \\neq b_2\\)). In this case, the parabolas could still intersect unless the directrices are parallel without different intercepts.\n\n### Step 3: Count Non-Intersecting Cases with Parallel Directrices\nWhen \\(a_1 = a_2\\), we want to consider the pairs of \\(b\\) values that do not allow intersection:\n- Both \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) must have the same sign to avoid intersection. This can happen in two scenarios:\n  - Both \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) are negative: The valid values are \\(-3, -2, -1\\), leading to \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) pairs.\n  - Both \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) are positive: The valid values are \\(1, 2, 3\\), also yielding \\(\\binom{3}{2} = 3\\) pairs.\n\nAdding these non-intersecting pairs gives:\n\\[\n3 (\\text{negative}) + 3 (\\text{positive}) = 6 \\text{ non-intersecting pairs}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Total Intersection Points\nThe total number of ways to choose 2 distinct parabolas from 30 is:\n\\[\n\\binom{30}{2} = \\frac{30 \\times 29}{2} = 435\n\\]\n\nNow, accounting for the pairs with identical slopes and non-intersecting \\(b\\) values:\n\\[\n5 \\times 6 = 30 \\quad (\\text{5 values of } a \\text{ and 6 non-intersecting pairs of } b)\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of pairs of parabolas that could potentially intersect (excluding the parallel cases) is:\n\\[\n435 - 30 = 405\n\\]\n\nSince each pair of parabolas can intersect at exactly 2 distinct points, we multiply by 2:\n\\[\n2 \\times 405 = 810\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the total number of intersecting points in the plane that are on two of the parabolas is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{810}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "If two parabolas have the same focus, and their directrices intersect, then the parabolas intersect in exactly two points.\n\nSuppose two parabolas have the same focus and their directrices are parallel.  If the focus lies between the two directrices, then the parabolas again intersect in exactly two points.  However, if the focus does not between the two directrices, then the parabolas do not intersect.\n\nThere are $\\binom{30}{2}$ ways to choose a pair of parabolas.  In terms of $a$ and $b,$ the parabolas do not intersect when their slopes $a$ are the same, and their $b$-values have the same sign (because this is when the focus does not lie between the two directrices).  There are five ways to choose the value of $a,$ and $\\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{3}{2} = 6$ ways to choose the values of $b$ (either both are negative or both are positive).  Hence, the total number of intersection points is\n\\[2 \\left( \\binom{30}{2} - 5 \\cdot 6 \\right) = \\boxed{810}.\\]"
