  "solution": "---\n\n### **Final Solution: Finding the Least Positive Integer**\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question asks us to find the least positive integer such that deleting its leftmost digit results in a number that's \\( \\frac{1}{29} \\) of the original. \n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n**Initial Reaction:**\n- This reminds me of problems involving manipulating digits and ratios.\n- It sounds like the number's structure is crucial since removing a digit significantly changes its value.\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Algebraic Approach:** Set up an equation representing the relationship between the original number and the number after deleting the leftmost digit.\n2. **Trial and Error with Small Numbers:** Start with small integers and manually check if they satisfy the condition.\n3. **Digit Analysis:** Consider how the number's length and its digits affect the ratio.\n4. **Use of Multiples of 29:** Since the ratio involves 29, perhaps the original number is a multiple of 29.\n\n**Brainstorming Reflection:**\n- The algebraic approach seems promising because it can generalize the problem.\n- Trial and error might be time-consuming but could work for small cases.\n- Digit analysis could provide insight into the number's structure.\n- Using multiples of 29 aligns with the ratio, so it might help.\n\n**Decision:**\nI'll start with the **Algebraic Approach** to set up a general formula. If that leads nowhere, I'll consider trial and error or digit analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Algebraic Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Let's represent the original integer with variables to capture its digits.\n- Removing the leftmost digit should relate the remaining number to the original through the given ratio.\n\n**Approach:**\n- Let the original number be \\( N \\).\n- Deleting the leftmost digit yields a new number \\( M \\).\n- According to the problem, \\( M = \\frac{1}{29} N \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This relationship is straightforward, but we need to express \\( M \\) in terms of \\( N \\) and its digits.\n- Time to dig deeper into how \\( N \\) and \\( M \\) relate through their digits.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Expressing \\( N \\) and \\( M \\) in Terms of Digits**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- We need to express \\( N \\) as a combination of its digits.\n- Removing the leftmost digit should simplify \\( N \\) into \\( M \\).\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Let\u2019s say \\( N \\) has \\( n \\) digits: \\( d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n \\).\n- The leftmost digit is \\( d_1 \\).\n- Removing \\( d_1 \\) shifts all other digits left.\n\n**Approach:**\n- Original number \\( N \\): \n  \\[\n  N = d_1 \\times 10^{n-1} + M\n  \\]\n- Given \\( M = \\frac{1}{29} N \\), substitute \\( M \\) into the equation:\n  \\[\n  M = \\frac{1}{29} (d_1 \\times 10^{n-1} + M)\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This seems correct, but it looks a bit complicated.\n- Maybe there's a simpler way to express \\( M \\) in terms of \\( N \\).\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n- Instead of expanding all digits, let's think of \\( N \\) and \\( M \\) in a more compact form.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Let\u2019s consider \\( N \\) as \\( d_1 \\times 10^{k} + M \\), where \\( k \\) is the number of digits in \\( M \\).\n- This simplifies our equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Simplifying the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- By expressing \\( N \\) in terms of \\( d_1 \\) and \\( M \\), we can directly relate them.\n\n**Approach:**\n- Continuing from the previous step,\n  \\[\n  M = \\frac{1}{29} (d_1 \\times 10^{n-1} + M)\n  \\]\n- Simplifying,\n  \\[\n  29M = d_1 \\times 10^{n-1} + M\n  \\]\n- Subtract \\( M \\) from both sides:\n  \\[\n  28M = d_1 \\times 10^{n-1}\n  \\]\n- Therefore,\n  \\[\n  M = \\frac{d_1 \\times 10^{n-1}}{28}\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This equation looks cleaner.\n- Now, \\( M \\) is expressed in terms of \\( d_1 \\) and \\( n \\).\n- We need to ensure that \\( M \\) is an integer, which imposes restrictions on \\( d_1 \\) and \\( n \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Determining Constraints on \\( d_1 \\) and \\( n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To satisfy the equation, \\( \\frac{d_1 \\times 10^{n-1}}{28} \\) must be an integer.\n- This means \\( d_1 \\times 10^{n-1} \\) must be divisible by 28.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Since \\( 10^{n-1} \\) is a power of 10, and 28 factors into \\( 4 \\times 7 \\), we need to check divisibility conditions.\n- Powers of 10 are divisible by 4 if \\( n-1 \\geq 2 \\), but not necessarily by 7.\n- Therefore, \\( d_1 \\) must compensate for divisibility by 7.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This insight is crucial. It suggests that \\( d_1 \\) must be a multiple of 7 for the equation to hold.\n\n**Approach:**\n- Therefore, \\( d_1 \\) must be a multiple of 7.\n- Moreover, \\( d_1 \\) is a single digit (1 to 9) since it\u2019s the leftmost digit of a positive integer.\n\n**Possible Values for \\( d_1 \\):**\n- The only single-digit multiple of 7 is 7.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- So, \\( d_1 = 7 \\).\n- This narrows down our options significantly.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Finding the Smallest \\( n \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- With \\( d_1 = 7 \\), we can now focus on finding the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( M \\) is an integer.\n\n**Approach:**\n- Our equation is now:\n  \\[\n  M = \\frac{7 \\times 10^{n-1}}{28} = \\frac{10^{n-1}}{4}\n  \\]\n- Since \\( M \\) must be an integer, \\( 10^{n-1} \\) must be divisible by 4.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- Powers of 10 are divisible by 4 starting from \\( 10^2 = 100 \\).\n- Therefore, \\( n-1 \\) must be at least 2, making \\( n \\) at least 3.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- This means the smallest number \\( N \\) must have at least 3 digits.\n- Let's verify this by calculating \\( M \\) for \\( n = 3 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n- For \\( n = 3 \\):\n  \\[\n  M = \\frac{10^{2}}{4} = \\frac{100}{4} = 25\n  \\]\n- Therefore, the original number \\( N \\) is:\n  \\[\n  N = 7 \\times 10^{2} + M = 700 + 25 = 725\n  \\]\n- Deleting the leftmost digit of 725 gives 25, and:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{725}{29} = 25\n  \\]\n- Which satisfies \\( M = \\frac{1}{29} N \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\n- It works! For \\( n = 3 \\), with \\( d_1 = 7 \\), we get \\( N = 725 \\) and \\( M = 25 \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Final Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- Before finalizing, let's ensure there are no smaller \\( n \\) or other digits \\( d_1 \\) that satisfy the condition.\n\n**Approach:**\n- Since \\( d_1 \\) must be 7 and \\( n \\) must be at least 3, there are no smaller possibilities.\n- Attempting \\( n = 2 \\) would result in \\( M = \\frac{10}{4} = 2.5 \\), which is not an integer.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- Therefore, \\( n = 3 \\) is indeed the smallest possible value.\n- The least positive integer satisfying the condition is \\( N = 725 \\).\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Verifying the solution with actual calculations ensured correctness.\n\n---\n\n### **<ANSWER>725</ANSWER>**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n**First Thoughts Recap:**\n- Initially considered multiple strategies, but the algebraic approach proved most effective.\n\n**Brainstorming Outcome:**\n- Identifying \\( d_1 \\) as a multiple of 7 was key to simplifying the problem.\n\n**Step-by-Step Verification:**\n- Each step logically followed from the previous one, leading to a consistent and correct solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The least positive integer satisfying the condition is **725**.\n\n---\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically, exploring different strategies, and continuously reflecting on each step's validity, we arrived at the correct solution efficiently.",
  "ground_truth": "The desired integer has at least two digits.  Let $d$ be its leftmost digit, and let $n$ be the integer that results when $d$ is deleted.  Then for some positive integer $p$, $10^p\\cdot\nd+n=29n$, and so $10^p\\cdot d=28n$. Therefore 7 is a divisor of $d$, and because $1\\le d\\le9$, it follows that $d=7$. Hence $10^p=4n$, so $\\displaystyle n={{10^p}\\over4}=\n{{100\\cdot10^{p-2}}\\over4}=25\\cdot10^{p-2}$.  Thus every positive integer with the desired property must be of the form $7\\cdot10^p+25\\cdot10^{p-2}=10^{p-2}(7\\cdot10^2+25)=725\\cdot10^{p-2}$ for some $p\\ge2$. The smallest such integer is $\\boxed{725}$."
