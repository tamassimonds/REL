  "problem": "At the beginning of every period of British Literature, Mrs. Crabapple picks a random student to receive a crabapple as a gift, but really, as you might imagine, they are quite bitter and nasty. Given that there are 11 students in her class and her class meets four times a week, how many different sequences of crabapple recipients are possible in a week?",
  "solution": "To find the number of different sequences of crabapple recipients in Mrs. Crabapple's class over a week, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Problem Overview**:\n   - There are 11 students in the class.\n   - The class meets 4 times each week.\n   - At each session, one student is randomly selected to receive a crabapple.\n\n2. **Choices for Each Session**:\n   - For every session, there are 11 possible students to choose from for receiving the crabapple.\n\n3. **Calculating Total Sequences**:\n   - Since the selection for each session is independent, we apply the multiplication principle of counting. The total number of sequences can be determined by multiplying the number of choices for each of the 4 sessions:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Sequences} = 11 \\times 11 \\times 11 \\times 11 = 11^4\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating \\(11^4\\)**:\n   - First, we calculate \\(11^2\\):\n     \\[\n     11^2 = 121\n     \\]\n   - Then, we find \\(11^4\\) by squaring \\(11^2\\):\n     \\[\n     11^4 = (11^2)^2 = 121^2\n     \\]\n   - Now calculating \\(121^2\\):\n     \\[\n     121 \\times 121 = 14641\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Result**:\n   - Therefore, the total number of different sequences of crabapple recipients over the week is \\(14641\\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<ANSWER>14641 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since there is no mention that a student cannot be picked twice, there are 11 possible victims every time the class meets. Therefore, our answer is $11 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 11 = 11^4 = \\boxed{14,\\!641}.$"
