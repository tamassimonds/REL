  "solution": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, creating a coherent and complete solution by reflecting on our natural thought process, just like solving it by hand.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first encounter this problem, I recognize it's about ensuring **continuity** in a piecewise function. **Continuity** means no jumps or gaps at the points where different pieces of the function meet. So, my goal is to find the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that make the function continuous at those transition points.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nI need to focus on the points where the function pieces connect\u2014specifically at \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = -2\\). Ensuring continuity there should lead me to the correct values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **Check Continuity at Transition Points (\\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = -2\\)):**  \n   - Make the left-hand limit (LHL) equal to the right-hand limit (RHL) at these points.\n   \n2. **Set Up Equations for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):**  \n   - Write equations based on continuity conditions and solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n   \n3. **Verify the Solution:**  \n   - Once \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are found, substitute back to ensure continuity is preserved.\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThinking it through, strategy 1 seems logical\u2014**ensuring continuity at the transition points** should provide the necessary equations. Let's proceed with checking continuity at each point.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Checking Continuity at \\(x = 2\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nAt \\(x = 2\\), the function transitions from \\(x - 5\\) to \\(ax + 3\\). To ensure continuity, the value of the function from the left (\\(x \\leq 2\\)) should equal the value from the right (\\(x > 2\\)).\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- **Left Side (\\(x = 2\\)):**  \n  \\[\n  f(2) = 2 - 5 = -3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Right Side (\\(x = 2\\)):**  \n  \\[\n  f(2) = a(2) + 3 = 2a + 3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Set Them Equal for Continuity:**  \n  \\[\n  2a + 3 = -3\n  \\]\n\n**Solving for \\(a\\):**  \n\\[\n2a = -3 - 3 \\implies 2a = -6 \\implies a = -3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nAlright, we've found \\(a = -3\\). But let's jot this down and move on to the next point to ensure everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Checking Continuity at \\(x = -2\\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, at \\(x = -2\\), the function transitions from \\(2x - b\\) to \\(x - 5\\). Again, I need the left-hand and right-hand limits to be equal.\n\n**Calculations:**  \n- **Left Side (\\(x = -2\\)):**  \n  \\[\n  f(-2) = 2(-2) - b = -4 - b\n  \\]\n  \n- **Right Side (\\(x = -2\\)):**  \n  \\[\n  f(-2) = -2 - 5 = -7\n  \\]\n  \n- **Set Them Equal for Continuity:**  \n  \\[\n  -4 - b = -7\n  \\]\n\n**Solving for \\(b\\):**  \n\\[\n-b = -7 + 4 \\implies -b = -3 \\implies b = 3\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nNow we have \\(b = 3\\). It seems straightforward, but before finalizing, let's **verify both solutions** to ensure continuity is maintained.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Verifying the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIt's always a good idea to **double-check our work**. Let's substitute \\(a = -3\\) and \\(b = 3\\) back into the function and see if continuity holds at both points.\n\n**Verification at \\(x = 2\\):**  \n- **From the Right:**  \n  \\[\n  f(2) = (-3)(2) + 3 = -6 + 3 = -3\n  \\]\n  \n- **From the Left:**  \n  \\[\n  f(2) = 2 - 5 = -3\n  \\]\n  \n- **Result:**  \n  Both sides are equal, so continuity is maintained at \\(x = 2\\).\n\n**Verification at \\(x = -2\\):**  \n- **From the Left:**  \n  \\[\n  f(-2) = 2(-2) - 3 = -4 - 3 = -7\n  \\]\n  \n- **From the Right:**  \n  \\[\n  f(-2) = -2 - 5 = -7\n  \\]\n  \n- **Result:**  \n  Again, both sides are equal, so continuity is maintained at \\(x = -2\\).\n\n**Reflection:**  \nEverything checks out! The function is continuous at both transition points, confirming that our values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finalizing the Answer**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow that we've verified the continuity conditions are satisfied with \\(a = -3\\) and \\(b = 3\\), we can confidently find \\(a + b\\).\n\n**Calculation:**  \n\\[\na + b = -3 + 3 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{0}\\)\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThat makes sense. All continuity conditions are satisfied, and the final sum \\(a + b\\) is zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy systematically checking the continuity at each transition point and verifying our solutions, we've ensured that the piecewise function is continuous. Here's a concise summary of our approach:\n\n1. **Identified Transition Points:**  \n   - \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = -2\\).\n   \n2. **Set Up Continuity Equations:**  \n   - At \\(x = 2\\): \\(2a + 3 = -3\\) \u2192 \\(a = -3\\).\n   - At \\(x = -2\\): \\(-4 - b = -7\\) \u2192 \\(b = 3\\).\n   \n3. **Verified the Solutions:**  \n   - Substituted \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) back to ensure continuity is maintained at both points.\n   \n4. **Computed the Final Answer:**  \n   - \\(a + b = 0\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{0}\\)\n\n---\n\nBy reflecting and double-checking at each step, we've confirmed the correctness of our approach and arrived confidently at the final answer.",
  "ground_truth": "For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must \"meet\" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \\Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\\boxed{0}$."
