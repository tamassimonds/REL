  "problem": "Suppose that the graph of a certain function, $y=f(x)$, has the property that if it is shifted $20$ units to the right, then the resulting graph is identical to the original graph of $y=f(x)$.\n\nWhat is the smallest positive $a$ such that if the graph of $y=f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$ is shifted $a$ units to the right, then we know that the resulting graph is identical to the original graph of $y=f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$?",
  "solution": "The function \\( y = f(x) \\) is periodic with a period of 20, which means that shifting the graph by 20 units to the right does not change its appearance. This is expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = f(x - 20)\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the transformed function \\( y = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right) \\) and seek a positive value \\( a \\) such that shifting this graph \\( a \\) units to the right produces an identical graph. This can be stated as:\n\n\\[\nf\\left( \\frac{x}{5} \\right) = f\\left( \\frac{x-a}{5} \\right)\n\\]\n\nTo simplify this, we can express the argument of the function on the right more clearly:\n\n\\[\nf\\left( \\frac{x}{5} \\right) = f\\left( \\frac{x}{5} - \\frac{a}{5} \\right)\n\\]\n\nFrom the periodic nature of \\( f(x) \\), we know that for the equation to hold, the difference between the two arguments must equal a multiple of the function's period (20). Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{5} = n \\cdot 20\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is some integer. Solving for \\( a \\), we have:\n\n\\[\na = 100n\n\\]\n\nTo find the smallest positive value of \\( a \\), we select \\( n = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\na = 100 \\cdot 1 = 100\n\\]\n\nThus, the smallest positive \\( a \\) such that shifting the graph of \\( y = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right) \\) by \\( a \\) units to the right results in the same graph is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{100}\n\\] \n\nIn summary, the answer is 100.",
  "ground_truth": "The stated property of $f(x)$ can be written as an equation which holds for all $x$: $$f(x-20) = f(x).$$We are looking for the smallest positive $a$ such that the equation $$f\\left(\\frac{x-a}5\\right) = f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$$holds for all $x$. Rewriting this equation as $$f\\left(\\frac x5-\\frac a5\\right) = f\\left(\\frac x5\\right),$$we see that it is implied by the known property of $f(x)$ if $\\frac a5$ is equal to $20$ (or a multiple of $20$), or in other words, if $a$ is equal to $100$ (or a multiple of $100$). So, the smallest positive $a$ for which we know that this property holds is $a=\\boxed{100}$."
