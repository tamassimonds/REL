  "problem": "Crestwood Elementary School has an active four-square league, consisting of ten players, including Justin and Tim. Each day at recess, the ten players split into two four-square games, each with five players in no relevant order. Over the course of a semester, each possible match-up of five players occurs once. How many times did Justin play in the same game as Tim?",
  "solution": "To determine how many times Justin and Tim played in the same game during the semester, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total Players**: There are 10 players in total: Justin, Tim, and 8 others.\n\n2. **Game Format**: Each game consists of 5 players.\n\n3. **Selecting Teams**: To form teams, we need to select 5 players from the total of 10. The number of ways to do this is calculated using the binomial coefficient:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{10}{5} = 252\n   \\]\n\n   This indicates there are 252 different combinations of 5 players from the group of 10.\n\n4. **Including Justin and Tim**: To find how many games Justin and Tim played together, we need to count the combinations where both are included. If we already select Justin and Tim, we then need to choose 3 more players from the remaining 8 players.\n\n   The number of ways to select 3 players from these 8 is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{3} = 56\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Result**: Therefore, the total number of games in which Justin and Tim played together is \\( 56 \\).\n\nIn summary, Justin and Tim played in the same game together in \\( <ANSWER> 56 </ANSWER> \\) different match-ups.",
  "ground_truth": "Each game has 5 players. The games that we are counting include Justin, Tim, and 3 of the 8 other players. There are $\\binom{8}{3}$ = 56 such match-ups.\n\n\nAlternatively, There are $\\binom{10}{5}$ = 252 different possible match-ups involving 5 of the 10 players. By symmetry, every player plays in exactly half of them, 126 games. In each of the 126 games that Tim plays, he plays with 4 of the other 9 players. Again by symmetry, he plays with each of those 9 players in 4/9 of his games. So he plays against Justin in 4/9 of 126 games, or $\\boxed{56}$ games."
