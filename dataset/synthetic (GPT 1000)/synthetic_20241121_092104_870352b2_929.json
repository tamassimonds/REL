  "solution": "To find the values of \\( j \\) such that the equation \\( (2x + 7)(x - 5) = -43 + jx \\) has exactly one real solution, we will analyze it step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Expand and Rearrange the Equation\n\nFirst, we expand the left-hand side:\n\n\\[\n(2x + 7)(x - 5) = 2x^2 - 10x + 7x - 35 = 2x^2 - 3x - 35.\n\\]\n\nRearranging the given equation results in:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 3x - 35 = -43 + jx.\n\\]\n\nThis can be further simplified to:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - (3 + j)x + 8 = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Condition for Exactly One Solution\n\nA quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) has exactly one real solution if the discriminant \\( D \\) equals zero. The discriminant is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac.\n\\]\n\nFor our equation:\n\n- \\( a = 2 \\)\n- \\( b = -(3 + j) \\)\n- \\( c = 8 \\)\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\[\nD = (-(3 + j))^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8 = (3 + j)^2 - 64.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Set the Discriminant to Zero\n\nTo ensure exactly one solution, we set the discriminant to zero:\n\n\\[\n(3 + j)^2 - 64 = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(3 + j)^2 = 64.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\( j \\)\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have two cases:\n\n1. **Case 1:**\n   \\[\n   3 + j = 8 \\implies j = 5.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Case 2:**\n   \\[\n   3 + j = -8 \\implies j = -11.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe values of \\( j \\) for which the equation has exactly one real solution are:\n\n\\[\n5, -11.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER> 5, -11 </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "We begin by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation and subtracting $-43+jx$ from both sides. We get $2x^2+(-3-j)x+8=0$. For this quadratic to have exactly one real root, the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ must be equal to $0$. Thus, we require $(-3-j)^2-4(2)(8) = 0$. Solving, we get that $j=\\boxed{5,\\,-11}$."
