  "problem": "A point whose coordinates are both integers is called a lattice point. How many lattice points lie on the hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$?\n",
  "solution": "To determine the number of lattice points on the hyperbola defined by the equation \\(x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearranging the Hyperbola Equation**: The equation can be rewritten by factoring:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) = 2000^2.\n   \\]\n   Letting \\(a = x - y\\) and \\(b = x + y\\), we obtain:\n   \\[\n   ab = 2000^2.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Factoring \\(2000^2\\)**: We start by factoring \\(2000\\):\n   \\[\n   2000 = 2^4 \\times 5^3.\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   2000^2 = (2^4 \\times 5^3)^2 = 2^8 \\times 5^6.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Total Number of Factors**: To find the number of factors, we use the formula:\n   \\[\n   d(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1),\n   \\]\n   where \\(n = p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times \\cdots \\times p_k^{e_k}\\). For \\(2000^2 = 2^8 \\times 5^6\\):\n   \\[\n   d(2000^2) = (8 + 1)(6 + 1) = 9 \\times 7 = 63.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Ensuring Integer Solutions**: Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) correspond to \\(x - y\\) and \\(x + y\\), we need both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be integers:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{a + b}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = \\frac{b - a}{2}.\n   \\]\n   For \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be integers, both \\(a + b\\) and \\(b - a\\) must be even, implying that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be even as well.\n\n5. **Substituting Even Variables**: Since both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are even, we can let \\(a = 2m\\) and \\(b = 2n\\). This leads to:\n   \\[\n   (2m)(2n) = 2000^2 \\implies 4mn = 2000^2 \\implies mn = \\frac{2000^2}{4} = 1000^2.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Finding Factors of \\(1000^2\\)**: Next, we factor \\(1000\\):\n   \\[\n   1000 = 10^3 = (2 \\times 5)^3 = 2^3 \\times 5^3,\n   \\]\n   so we have:\n   \\[\n   1000^2 = (2^3 \\times 5^3)^2 = 2^6 \\times 5^6.\n   \\]\n   The number of factors of \\(1000^2\\) is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   d(1000^2) = (6 + 1)(6 + 1) = 7 \\times 7 = 49.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Counting Unique Solutions**: Each factor pair \\((m, n)\\) provides a distinct pair of even factors \\((a, b)\\). Since both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) can independently take on positive and negative values, we multiply the number of valid pairs by 2, resulting in:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 49 = 98.\n   \\]\n\nIn conclusion, the total number of lattice points on the hyperbola \\(x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2\\) is \\( \\boxed{98} \\).",
  "ground_truth": "\\[(x-y)(x+y)=2000^2=2^8 \\cdot 5^6\\]\nNote that $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$ have the same parities, so both must be even. We first give a factor of $2$ to both $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$. We have $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$ left. Since there are $7 \\cdot 7=49$ factors of $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$, and since both $x$ and $y$ can be negative, this gives us $49\\cdot2=\\boxed{98}$ lattice points."
