  "problem": "Determine the sum of all prime numbers $p$ for which there exists no integer solution in $x$ to the congruence $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p$.",
  "solution": "To solve the congruence problem given by\n\n\\[\n3(6x + 1) \\equiv 4 \\pmod{p},\n\\]\n\nwe start by simplifying the equation. Distributing \\(3\\) yields:\n\n\\[\n18x + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{p}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we rearrange this to isolate the term involving \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}.\n\\]\n\nThis tells us we need an integer solution \\(x\\) such that \\(18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}\\). According to number theory, this congruence has a solution if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \\(18\\) and \\(p\\) is \\(1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(18, p) = 1.\n\\]\n\nIf \\(\\gcd(18, p) \\neq 1\\), there are no integer solutions. \n\nNext, we determine which prime numbers \\(p\\) make \\(\\gcd(18, p) \\neq 1\\). The prime factorization of \\(18\\) is:\n\n\\[\n18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2.\n\\]\n\nThe prime factors of \\(18\\) are \\(2\\) and \\(3\\). Thus, the primes \\(p\\) that do not satisfy \\(\\gcd(18, p) = 1\\) are exactly the primes dividing \\(18\\):\n\n- \\(p = 2\\)\n- \\(p = 3\\)\n\nNow, we calculate the sum of these primes:\n\n\\[\n2 + 3 = 5.\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of all prime numbers \\(p\\) for which there is no integer solution to the congruence \\(3(6x + 1) \\equiv 4 \\pmod{p}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}.\n\\] \n\nIn conclusion, the final answer remains \\(5\\).",
  "ground_truth": "Firstly, the congruence can be simplified to $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p\\implies 18x\\equiv 1\\pmod p$. This is solvable for $x$ if and only if $18$ is invertible modulo $p$, meaning $\\gcd(18,p)=1$. Since the prime factors of $18$ are $2,3$, these are precisely the prime moduli for which an $x$ cannot exist since then $\\gcd(18,p)>1$. Thus, the desired number is $2+3=\\boxed{5}$."
