  "solution": "To find the sum of all positive even factors of \\(504\\), we proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of \\(504\\)**:\n   We start by determining the prime factorization:\n   - \\(504\\) is divided by \\(2\\):\n     \\[\n     504 \\div 2 = 252\n     \\]\n   - Continuing with \\(252\\):\n     \\[\n     252 \\div 2 = 126\n     \\]\n   - Then for \\(126\\):\n     \\[\n     126 \\div 2 = 63\n     \\]\n   - Since \\(63\\) is odd, we divide by the next prime number, \\(3\\):\n     \\[\n     63 \\div 3 = 21\n     \\]\n   - Continuing with \\(21\\):\n     \\[\n     21 \\div 3 = 7\n     \\]\n   - Finally, \\(7\\) is a prime number itself.\n\n   Thus, the prime factorization of \\(504\\) is:\n   \\[\n   504 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Even Factors**:\n   - An even factor must include at least one \\(2\\). The general form of the factors is:\n   \\[\n   n = 2^a \\times 3^b \\times 7^c\n   \\]\n   with the constraints \\(0 \\leq a \\leq 3\\), \\(0 \\leq b \\leq 2\\), and \\(0 \\leq c \\leq 1\\). For even factors, \\(a\\) must be at least \\(1\\) (i.e., \\(a = 1, 2, 3\\)).\n\n3. **Count Contributions of \\(b\\) and \\(c\\)**:\n   - The values of \\(b\\) (which can be \\(0, 1, 2\\)) provide \\(3\\) options.\n   - The values of \\(c\\) (which can be \\(0, 1\\)) provide \\(2\\) options.\n   - Thus, the total number of even factors is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Even Factors Count} = 3 \\text{ (for } a\\text{)} \\times 3 \\text{ (for } b\\text{)} \\times 2 \\text{ (for } c\\text{)} = 18\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum of All Factors**:\n   The sum of the factors of \\(504\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma(n) = (p_1^{k_1+1} - 1) \\div (p_1 - 1) \\times (p_2^{k_2+1} - 1) \\div (p_2 - 1) \\times (p_3^{k_3+1} - 1) \\div (p_3 - 1)\n   \\]\n   Applying it to \\(504\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sigma(504) = \\left(\\frac{2^{3+1} - 1}{2 - 1}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3^{2+1} - 1}{3 - 1}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{7^{1+1} - 1}{7 - 1}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   - Calculating each part:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2^4 - 1}{1} = 15\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3^3 - 1}{2} = 13\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{7^2 - 1}{6} = 8\n     \\]\n   - Now we multiply these results:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma(504) = 15 \\times 13 \\times 8\n   \\]\n   - Performing the calculation stepwise gives:\n     \\[\n     15 \\times 13 = 195\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     195 \\times 8 = 1560\n     \\]\n\n5. **Sum of Even Factors**:\n   To find the sum of the even factors, we first calculate the sum of the odd factors. The odd factors are derived from the prime factorization excluding the \\(2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sigma_{odd}(n) = \\sigma(3^2 \\times 7^1) = (13) \\times (8) = 104\n   \\]\n   Now we find the sum of the even factors by subtracting the sum of the odd factors from the total sum of the factors:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum of even factors} = \\sigma(504) - \\sigma_{odd}(504) = 1560 - 104 = 1456\n   \\]\n\nThus, the sum of all positive even factors of \\(504\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1456}\n\\] \n\nIn summary, the solution is clearly laid out, starting from prime factorization, determining the structure of the factors, calculating the total sums, and isolating the even factors to arrive at the final result.",
  "ground_truth": "First, we find that the prime factorization of $504$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7$. Note that the even divisors of 504 are precisely the integers of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ where $1\\leq a \\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$. Note also that distributing $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)$ yields 18 terms, with each integer of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ (again, where $1\\leq a \\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$) appearing exactly once.  It follows that the sum of the even divisors of 504 is $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)=\\boxed{1456}$."
