  "problem": "Let $S$ be the set of integers between $1$ and $2^{40}$ whose binary expansions have exactly two $1$'s. If a number is chosen at random from $S,$ the probability that it is divisible by $9$ is $p/q,$ where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q.$\n",
  "solution": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen integer from the set \\( S \\) is divisible by \\( 9 \\), we can follow these concise steps:\n\n1. **Define the Set \\( S \\)**:\n   Let \\( S \\) be the set of integers between \\( 1 \\) and \\( 2^{40} \\) that can be represented in binary with exactly two \\( 1 \\)'s. Each number in \\( S \\) can be expressed as \\( 2^i + 2^j \\), where \\( 0 \\leq i < j < 40 \\).\n\n2. **Count Elements in \\( S \\)**:\n   The count of such integers is given by the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   |S| = \\binom{40}{2} = \\frac{40 \\cdot 39}{2} = 780.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine Divisibility by \\( 9 \\)**:\n   We need to check which of these numbers are divisible by \\( 9 \\). A number is divisible by \\( 9 \\) if:\n   \\[\n   n \\equiv 0 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 9).\n   \\]\n   We compute the residues of \\( 2^k \\) modulo \\( 9 \\):\n   - \\( 2^0 \\equiv 1 \\)\n   - \\( 2^1 \\equiv 2 \\)\n   - \\( 2^2 \\equiv 4 \\)\n   - \\( 2^3 \\equiv 8 \\equiv -1 \\)\n   - \\( 2^4 \\equiv 7 \\equiv -2 \\)\n   - \\( 2^5 \\equiv 5 \\equiv -4 \\)\n\n   The residues repeat every 6 terms as \\( \\{1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5\\} \\).\n\n4. **Identify Valid Pairs**:\n   We examine pairs \\( (i, j) \\) such that \\( 2^i + 2^j \\equiv 0 \\, (\\text{mod} \\, 9) \\). The valid combinations are:\n   - \\( (0, 3) \\) yields \\( 1 + 8 \\equiv 0 \\)\n   - \\( (1, 4) \\) yields \\( 2 + 7 \\equiv 0 \\)\n   - \\( (2, 5) \\) yields \\( 4 + 5 \\equiv 0 \\)\n\n   This results in three valid pairs: \\( (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5) \\).\n\n5. **Count Valid Combinations**:\n   We calculate the number of valid pairs for each residue combination:\n   - For \\( (0, 3) \\): There are \\( 7 \\) choices for \\( i \\) (\\( k \\equiv 0 \\mod 6 \\)) and \\( 7 \\) choices for \\( j \\) (\\( k \\equiv 3 \\mod 6 \\)), giving \\( 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\).\n   - For \\( (1, 4) \\): There are \\( 7 \\) choices for \\( i \\) and \\( 6 \\) remaining choices for \\( j \\), yielding \\( 7 \\times 6 = 42 \\).\n   - For \\( (2, 5) \\): Similarly, \\( 7 \\times 6 = 42 \\).\n\n   Therefore, the total number of valid pairs is:\n   \\[\n   49 + 42 + 42 = 133.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the Probability**:\n   The probability \\( P \\) that a randomly chosen number from \\( S \\) is divisible by \\( 9 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{133}{780}.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Simplify the Fraction**:\n   The numbers \\( 133 \\) and \\( 780 \\) are relatively prime, so this fraction cannot be simplified further.\n\n8. **Final Calculation**:\n   We express the final answer in the form \\( p + q \\):\n   \\[\n   p = 133, \\quad q = 780 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad p + q = 133 + 780 = 913.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{913}.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "A positive integer $n$ has exactly two 1s in its binary representation exactly when $n = 2^j + 2^k$ for $j \\neq k$ nonnegative integers. Thus, the set $S$ is equal to the set $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid n = 2^j + 2^k \\,\\mathrm{ and }\\, 0 \\leq j < k \\leq 39\\}$. (The second condition ensures simultaneously that $j \\neq k$ and that each such number less than $2^{40}$ is counted exactly once.) This means there are ${40 \\choose 2} = 780$ total such numbers.\nNow, consider the powers of $2$ mod $9$: $2^{6n} \\equiv 1, 2^{6n + 1} \\equiv 2, 2^{6n + 2} \\equiv 4, 2^{6n + 3} \\equiv 8 \\equiv -1,$ $2^{6n + 4} \\equiv 7 \\equiv -2,$ $2^{6n + 5} \\equiv 5 \\equiv -4 \\pmod 9$.\nIt's clear what the pairs $j, k$ can look like. If one is of the form $6n$ (7 choices), the other must be of the form $6n + 3$ (7 choices). If one is of the form $6n + 1$ (7 choices) the other must be of the form $6n + 4$ (6 choices). And if one is of the form $6n + 2$ (7 choices), the other must be of the form $6n + 5$ (6 choices). This means that there are $7\\cdot 7 + 7\\cdot 6 + 7\\cdot 6 = 49 + 42 +42 = 133$ total \"good\" numbers.\nThe probability is $\\frac{133}{780}$, and the answer is $133 + 780 = \\boxed{913}$."
