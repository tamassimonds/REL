  "problem": "An ordinary $6$-sided die has a number on each face from $1$ to $6$ (each number appears on one face). How many ways can I paint two faces of a die red, so that the numbers on the red faces don't add up to $7$?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of painting two faces of a die red such that the numbers on the red faces do not add up to 7, we can follow this structured approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Faces of the Die**: A standard die has faces numbered from 1 to 6.\n\n2. **Calculate Possible Combinations**: To determine how many ways we can choose 2 faces to paint red, we use the binomial coefficient to find all possible pairs of faces:\n\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, there are 15 different combinations of two faces.\n\n3. **Identify Pairs Adding to 7**: Next, we identify pairs of faces that sum to 7, which are:\n   - (1, 6)\n   - (2, 5)\n   - (3, 4)\n\n   This gives us a total of 3 pairs that must be excluded.\n\n4. **Calculate Valid Combinations**: To find the valid combinations of painted faces, we subtract the excluded pairs from the total combinations:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Valid pairs} = \\text{Total pairs} - \\text{Excluded pairs} = 15 - 3 = 12\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the total number of ways to paint two faces of a die red, ensuring their numbers do not sum to 7, is 12.\n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>12 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "I can pick one face in $6$ ways. Then, I have $4$ choices for the second face, because I can't pick the first face again, nor can I pick the unique face with which it makes $7$. So I seem to have $6\\cdot 4 = 24$ choices -- but this actually overcounts the possible results by a factor of $2$, because in the end, it doesn't matter which of the two red faces I chose first and which I chose second. So the actual number of possibilities is $24/2$, or $\\boxed{12}$.\n\nThere's another neat way to see this! If you have an ordinary die, you may notice that the pairs of numbers which add up to $7$ are all on pairs of opposite faces. (For example, the $1$ is opposite the $6$.) This means that in order to paint two faces that don't add up to $7$, I must choose any two faces that aren't opposite. Two faces that aren't opposite must share an edge, and there is exactly one pair of faces meeting along each edge of the die. Since a cube has $12$ edges, there are $\\boxed{12}$ choices I can make."
