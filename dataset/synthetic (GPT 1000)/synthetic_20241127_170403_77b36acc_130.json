  "solution": "Absolutely! Let's piece together the solution step by step, maintaining a clear and coherent flow. I'll ensure that each part of the thought process is connected seamlessly, reflecting a natural problem-solving approach.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem**\n\n- **What's Being Asked?**\n  - We need to find two values of \\(a\\) such that the quadratic equation \\(4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0\\) has **only one solution** for \\(x\\).\n  \n- **Initial Observations:**\n  - The equation includes both an \\(ax\\) and an \\(8x\\), which suggests that we might be able to **combine like terms** to simplify it.\n  - Having only one solution typically indicates that the **discriminant** of the quadratic is zero.\n\n- **Brainstorming Strategies:**\n  - **Option 1:** Combine like terms to simplify the equation.\n  - **Option 2:** Apply the condition for a quadratic to have a single solution using the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac = 0\\)).\n  - **Option 3:** Consider completing the square or factoring, but these might not be necessary if the discriminant approach works.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Simplifying the Equation**\n\n- **Combining Like Terms:**\n  - Let's start by simplifying the equation to make it easier to work with.\n  - Original equation:  \n    \\[\n    4x^2 + ax + 8x + 9 = 0\n    \\]\n  - Notice that \\(ax\\) and \\(8x\\) are both linear terms. We can combine them:  \n    \\[\n    4x^2 + (a + 8)x + 9 = 0\n    \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - **Does This Help?**  \n    Yes, now the equation looks like a standard quadratic:  \n    \\[\n    4x^2 + (a + 8)x + 9 = 0\n    \\]\n    This simplification makes it easier to apply quadratic formula concepts.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Applying the Condition for One Solution**\n\n- **Thinking About the Discriminant:**\n  - For a quadratic equation \\(Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0\\) to have only one solution, the **discriminant must be zero**:  \n    \\[\n    B^2 - 4AC = 0\n    \\]\n  \n- **Assigning Coefficients:**\n  - From our simplified equation:  \n    \\[\n    A = 4,\\quad B = a + 8,\\quad C = 9\n    \\]\n  \n- **Calculating the Discriminant:**\n  \\[\n  (a + 8)^2 - 4 \\times 4 \\times 9 = 0\n  \\]\n  \n- **Simplifying:**\n  \\[\n  (a + 8)^2 - 144 = 0\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (a + 8)^2 = 144\n  \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - **Is This Correct?**  \n    Yes, setting the discriminant to zero leads us to \\((a + 8)^2 = 144\\). This equation will help us solve for \\(a\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solving for \\(a\\)**\n\n- **Taking the Square Root:**\n  \\[\n  a + 8 = \\pm 12\n  \\]\n  \n- **Finding \\(a\\):**\n  - **Case 1:**  \n    \\[\n    a + 8 = 12 \\implies a = 12 - 8 = 4\n    \\]\n  - **Case 2:**  \n    \\[\n    a + 8 = -12 \\implies a = -12 - 8 = -20\n    \\]\n  \n- **Reflection:**\n  - **Do These Values Make Sense?**  \n    We've found two values: \\(a = 4\\) and \\(a = -20\\). Since the problem asks for two values that satisfy the condition, this seems correct. However, it's important to **verify** these solutions to ensure accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Solutions**\n\n- **Why Verification is Important:**\n  - To confirm that both values of \\(a\\) indeed result in the quadratic equation having only one solution.\n\n- **Quick Check:**\n\n  - **Plugging \\(a = 4\\) Back into the Original Equation:**\n    \\[\n    4x^2 + 4x + 8x + 9 = 0 \\implies 4x^2 + 12x + 9 = 0\n    \\]\n    - **Calculating Discriminant:**  \n      \\[\n      12^2 - 4 \\times 4 \\times 9 = 144 - 144 = 0\n      \\]\n    - **Result:**  \n      Discriminant is zero \u21d2 Only one solution. **This works!**\n\n  - **Plugging \\(a = -20\\) Back into the Original Equation:**\n    \\[\n    4x^2 - 20x + 8x + 9 = 0 \\implies 4x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0\n    \\]\n    - **Calculating Discriminant:**  \n      \\[\n      (-12)^2 - 4 \\times 4 \\times 9 = 144 - 144 = 0\n      \\]\n    - **Result:**  \n      Discriminant is zero \u21d2 Only one solution. **This also works!**\n\n- **Reflection:**\n  - **Do Both Values Hold Up?**  \n    Yes, both \\(a = 4\\) and \\(a = -20\\) satisfy the condition of having only one solution. This verification step confirms that our solutions are **correct**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Sum of \\(a\\) Values**\n\n- **Summing Up the Values:**\n  \\[\n  4 + (-20) = -16\n  \\]\n  \n- **Final Reflection:**\n  - **Is This the Final Answer?**  \n    Yes, the sum of the two values of \\(a\\) is \\(-16\\). All steps have been checked and verified, ensuring the **accuracy** of the solution.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>-16</ANSWER>  \nThe sum of the two values of \\(a\\) is **\\(-16\\)**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts: Recapping the Approach**\n\n- **Brainstorming and Strategy Selection:**\n  - **Initial Ideas:** Combining like terms and using the discriminant were key strategies that led to simplifying the problem effectively.\n  - **Alternative Methods:** While completing the square or factoring were considered, they weren't necessary once the discriminant approach proved straightforward.\n\n- **Step-by-Step Execution:**\n  - Simplifying the equation made it easier to identify the coefficients needed for the discriminant formula.\n  - Applying the condition for one solution led directly to solving for \\(a\\).\n  \n- **Verification and Validation:**\n  - Plugging the solutions back into the original equation ensured that both values of \\(a\\) satisfied the condition of having only one solution.\n  - This step was crucial in confirming the **correctness** of the solutions.\n\n- **Final Calculation:**\n  - Summing the two values of \\(a\\) provided the final answer, with all intermediate steps supporting the result.\n\nBy approaching the problem methodically, checking each step, and verifying the results, we confidently arrived at the correct solution. This structured approach not only ensures accuracy but also enhances understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts.",
  "ground_truth": "The quadratic formula yields \\[x=\\frac{-(a+8)\\pm \\sqrt{(a+8)^2-4\\cdot 4\\cdot 9}}{2\\cdot 4}. \\]The equation has only one solution precisely when the value of the discriminant, $(a+8)^2-144$, is 0. This implies that $a=-20$ or $a=4$, and the sum is $\\boxed{-16}$."
