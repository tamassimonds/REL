  "problem": "Find the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of $x^2-13x+4=0$.",
  "solution": "To find the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of the polynomial \\(x^2 - 13x + 4 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Roots**: Let the roots of the quadratic equation be \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\).\n\n2. **Sum of Reciprocals**: The sum of the reciprocals of the roots is expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{r_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2} = \\frac{r_1 + r_2}{r_1 r_2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply Vieta\u2019s Formulas**: For a quadratic equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), Vieta's formulas provide:\n   - The sum of the roots \\(r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{b}{a}\\)\n   - The product of the roots \\(r_1 r_2 = \\frac{c}{a}\\)\n\n   In our equation \\(x^2 - 13x + 4 = 0\\):\n   - \\(a = 1\\)\n   - \\(b = -13\\)\n   - \\(c = 4\\)\n\n   Thus, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{-13}{1} = 13\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   r_1 r_2 = \\frac{4}{1} = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Sum of the Reciprocals**: Substituting the values we found into the formula for the sum of reciprocals, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{r_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2} = \\frac{r_1 + r_2}{r_1 r_2} = \\frac{13}{4}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Result**: Therefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the roots is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{13}{4}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<ANSWER> 13/4 solution </ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this polynomial. Therefore, $r_1+r_2=13$ and $r_1r_2=4$. Notice that the sum of the reciprocals of the roots can be obtained by dividing the first equation by the second equation: $\\frac{r_1+r_2}{r_1r_2}=\\frac{1}{r_1}+\\frac{1}{r_2}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{4}}$."
