  "problem": "Given that the point $(4,7)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, there is one point that must be on the graph of $2y=3f(4x)+5$. What is the sum of the coordinates of that point?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we start with the information that the point \\((4, 7)\\) lies on the graph of the function \\(y = f(x)\\), which gives us \\(f(4) = 7\\).\n\nNext, we look at the transformed function given by the equation \\(2y = 3f(4x) + 5\\). To express this in terms of \\(y\\), we rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{3f(4x) + 5}{2}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the specific point that corresponds to this transformed function. To do this, we will investigate \\(f(4x)\\) by setting \\(4x = 4\\), which simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx = 1\n\\]\n\nWith \\(x = 1\\), we can evaluate \\(f(4x)\\):\n\n\\[\nf(4 \\cdot 1) = f(4) = 7\n\\]\n\nNow we substitute \\(f(4)\\) back into the transformed equation for \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{3f(4) + 5}{2} = \\frac{3(7) + 5}{2}\n\\]\n\nWe calculate this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, calculate \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\).\n2. Next, add \\(5\\): \\(21 + 5 = 26\\).\n3. Finally, divide by \\(2\\): \\(\\frac{26}{2} = 13\\).\n\nThus, when \\(x = 1\\), we find that \\(y = 13\\), which means the point \\((1, 13)\\) lies on the graph of the transformed function \\(y = \\frac{3f(4x) + 5}{2}\\).\n\nTo finish, we sum the coordinates of the point \\((1, 13)\\):\n\n\\[\n1 + 13 = 14\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<ANSWER>14</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Since $(4,7)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we know  \\[7=f(4).\\]Using that $f(4\\cdot1)=7$, we can also say \\[3f(4\\cdot1)+5=3\\cdot7+5=26=2\\cdot13.\\]Therefore $(x,y)=(1,13)$ is on the graph of  \\[2y=3f(4\\cdot x)+5.\\]The sum of these coordinates is $1+13=\\boxed{14}$."
