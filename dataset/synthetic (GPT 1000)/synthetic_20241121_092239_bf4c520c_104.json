  "problem": "The quadratic $8x^2+12x-14$ has two real roots. What is the sum of the squares of these roots? Express your answer as a common fraction in lowest terms.",
  "solution": "To find the sum of the squares of the roots of the quadratic equation \\( 8x^2 + 12x - 14 = 0 \\), we can utilize Vi\u00e8te's formulas, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to the sums and products of its roots.\n\n1. **Identify the Coefficients**:\n   In the quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), we have:\n   - \\( a = 8 \\)\n   - \\( b = 12 \\)\n   - \\( c = -14 \\)\n\n2. **Calculate the Roots' Sum and Product**:\n   According to Vi\u00e8te's formulas:\n   - The sum of the roots \\( r_1 + r_2 \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{b}{a} = -\\frac{12}{8} = -\\frac{3}{2}.\n     \\]\n   - The product of the roots \\( r_1 r_2 \\) is:\n     \\[\n     r_1 r_2 = \\frac{c}{a} = \\frac{-14}{8} = -\\frac{7}{4}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Sum of the Squares of the Roots**:\n   The sum of the squares of the roots \\( r_1^2 + r_2^2 \\) can be calculated using the identity:\n   \\[\n   r_1^2 + r_2^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 2r_1 r_2.\n   \\]\n   First, calculate \\( (r_1 + r_2)^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   (r_1 + r_2)^2 = \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{4}.\n   \\]\n   Next, calculate \\( 2r_1 r_2 \\):\n   \\[\n   2r_1 r_2 = 2 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{7}{4}\\right) = -\\frac{7}{2}.\n   \\]\n   Now, substitute these values into the identity:\n   \\[\n   r_1^2 + r_2^2 = \\frac{9}{4} - \\left(-\\frac{7}{2}\\right).\n   \\]\n   Convert \\(-\\frac{7}{2}\\) to a fraction with a common denominator:\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{7}{2} = -\\frac{14}{4}.\n   \\]\n   Thus, we have:\n   \\[\n   r_1^2 + r_2^2 = \\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{14}{4} = \\frac{23}{4}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   Therefore, the sum of the squares of the roots of the quadratic equation \\( 8x^2 + 12x - 14 \\) is \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\frac{23}{4}}.\n   \\]",
  "ground_truth": "Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of the equation $8x^2+12x-14$. We want to find $x_1^2+x_2^2$. Note that $x_1^2+x_2^2=(x_1+x_2)^2-2x_1x_2$. We know that $x_1+x_2$, the sum of the roots, is equal to $\\frac{-b}{a}$, which for this equation is $\\frac{-12}{8}=\\frac{-3}{2}$. Likewise, we know that $x_1x_2$, the product of the roots, is equal to $\\frac{c}{a}$, which for this equation is $\\frac{-14}{8}=\\frac{-7}{4}$. Thus, $x_1^2+x_2^2=\\left(\\frac{-3}{2}\\right)^2-2\\left(\\frac{-7}{4}\\right)=\\frac{9}{4}+\\frac{14}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{23}{4}}$."
