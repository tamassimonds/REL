  "problem": "Suppose 5 different integers are randomly chosen from between 20 and 69, inclusive.  What is the probability that they each have a different tens digit?",
  "solution": "To find the probability that 5 different integers randomly chosen from the range of 20 to 69, inclusive, each have a different tens digit, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Range and Tens Digits\nThe integers from 20 to 69 fall within five distinct tens digit categories:\n- 20-29: Tens digit = 2\n- 30-39: Tens digit = 3\n- 40-49: Tens digit = 4\n- 50-59: Tens digit = 5\n- 60-69: Tens digit = 6\n\nThus, there are **five tens digits**: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n### Step 2: Total Outcomes\nThe total number of integers in the range of 20 to 69 is \\(69 - 20 + 1 = 50\\). To calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 different integers from these 50, we use the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{50}{5} = \\frac{50!}{5!(50-5)!} = \\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 47 \\times 46}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2118760.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Successful Outcomes\nTo ensure that all selected integers have different tens digits, we must select one integer from each of the five tens digit categories. Each category contains 10 integers, so for each chosen tens digit (2 through 6), there are 10 possible selections:\n\\[\n10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 10^5 = 100000.\n\\]\nHence, there are **100,000 successful outcomes** where each integer has a different tens digit.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Probability\nThe probability \\(P\\) that the 5 selected integers have different tens digits is the ratio of successful outcomes to total outcomes:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{100000}{2118760}.\n\\]\nBy simplifying the fraction, we get approximately:\n\\[\nP \\approx 0.0472.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nConsequently, the probability that 5 different integers chosen randomly from between 20 and 69, inclusive, each have a different tens digit is approximately:\n<ANSWER>0.0472 solution</ANSWER>.",
  "ground_truth": "In this set of integers, there are 5 tens digits: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  If 5 integers all have different tens digits, then there must be exactly one integer among the 5 with each tens digit.  Since there are 10 different integers for each tens digit, the number of ways to pick, without regard to order, 5 different integers with different tens digits is $10^5$.  The total number of combinations of 5 integers is $\\binom{50}{5}$.  So the probability that 5 integers drawn all have the different tens digits is $$ \\frac{10^5}{\\binom{50}{5}} = \\frac{100000}{2118760} = \\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}. $$"
