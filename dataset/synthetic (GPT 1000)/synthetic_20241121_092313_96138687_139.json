  "solution": "To determine the area where Chuck the llama can play while tied to the corner of a \\(2\\text{ m}\\) by \\(3\\text{ m}\\) shed with a \\(3\\text{ m}\\) leash, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Positioning Chuck\n\nWe place the corner of the shed where Chuck is tied at the origin \\((0, 0)\\). The shed occupies the space from \\((0, 0)\\) to \\((3, 0)\\) along the x-axis (3 m wide) and from \\((0, 0)\\) to \\((0, 2)\\) along the y-axis (2 m tall).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Circular Area\n\nChuck can move in a circular area with a radius of \\(3\\text{ m}\\). The area of a full circle is given by:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{circle}} = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (3)^2 = 9\\pi \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since he is tied at a corner, he can only access a portion of this circular area.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Accessible Area\n\nChuck can access three-quarters of the circular area because the shed blocks part of it. Therefore, the accessible area is:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{accessible}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times A_{\\text{circle}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 9\\pi = \\frac{27\\pi}{4} \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Additional Area Below the Shed\n\nChuck can also move downward beyond the shed's edge. Since the shed is \\(2\\text{ m}\\) tall and his leash is \\(3\\text{ m}\\), he can extend his leash an additional \\(1\\text{ m}\\) downward. This allows him to form a quarter-circle with a radius of \\(1\\text{ m}\\) in that space, giving an additional area of:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{extra}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\pi (1)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Total Accessible Area\n\nNow, we sum the two areas to find the total area available for Chuck to play:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{total}} = A_{\\text{accessible}} + A_{\\text{extra}} = \\frac{27\\pi}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}\\pi = \\frac{27\\pi + \\pi}{4} = \\frac{28\\pi}{4} = 7\\pi \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the total area where Chuck can play is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7\\pi} \\text{ m}^2.\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "When Chuck has the leash extended to its full length, he can move in a $270^\\circ$ arc, or $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a full circle about the point where the leash is attached. (He is blocked from going further by the shed.)\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(15,0)--(15,10)--(0,10)--cycle,black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((15,10)--(27,19),black+linewidth(1));\ndot((27,19));\nlabel(\"Shed\",(7.5,5));\nlabel(\"2\",(0,0)--(0,10),W);\nlabel(\"3\",(0,0)--(15,0),S);\nlabel(\"3\",(15,10)--(27,19),SE);\ndraw((0,10)..(3,19)..(6,22)..(24,22)..(27,19)..(30,10)..(27,1)..(24,-2)..(15,-5),black+linewidth(1)+dashed);\ndraw((15,0)--(15,-5),black+linewidth(1)+dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nThe area that he can play inside this circle is $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the area of a full circle of radius $3,$ or $$\\frac{3}{4}\\times \\pi(3^2)=\\frac{27}{4}\\pi.$$ When the leash is extended fully to the left, Chuck just reaches the top left corner of the shed, so can go no further. When the leash is extended fully to the bottom, Chuck's leash extends $1\\text{ m}$ below the length of the shed. This means that Chuck can play in more area to the left.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(15,0)--(15,10)--(0,10)--cycle,black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((15,10)--(27,19),black+linewidth(1));\ndot((27,19));\nlabel(\"Shed\",(7.5,5));\nlabel(\"2\",(0,0)--(0,10),W);\nlabel(\"3\",(15,10)--(27,19),SE);\ndraw((0,10)..(3,19)..(6,22)..(24,22)..(27,19)..(30,10)..(27,1)..(24,-2)..(15,-5),black+linewidth(1)+dashed);\ndraw((15,0)--(15,-5),black+linewidth(1)+dashed);\ndraw((15,-5)..(11.4645,-3.5355)..(10,0),black+linewidth(1)+dashed);\nlabel(\"1\",(15,0)--(15,-5),W);\nlabel(\"2\",(15,0)--(15,10),E);\nlabel(\"3\",(0,10)--(15,10),N);\n[/asy]\n\nThis area is a $90^\\circ$ sector of a circle of radius $1,$ or $\\frac{1}{4}$ of this circle.  So this additional area is $$\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\pi (1^2)=\\frac{1}{4}\\pi.$$ So the total area that Chuck has in which to play is $$\\frac{27}{4}\\pi + \\frac{1}{4}\\pi = \\frac{28}{4}\\pi = \\boxed{7\\pi}\\text{ m}^2.$$"
