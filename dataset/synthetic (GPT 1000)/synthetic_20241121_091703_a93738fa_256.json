  "problem": "When a certain biased coin is flipped five times, the probability of getting heads exactly once is not equal to $0$ and is the same as that of getting heads exactly twice. Let $\\frac ij$, in lowest terms, be the probability that the coin comes up heads in exactly $3$ out of $5$ flips. Find $i+j$.\n",
  "solution": "To solve the problem, we begin by defining the probability of getting heads when flipping a biased coin as \\( p \\). Consequently, the probability of tails is \\( 1 - p \\).\n\nWe focus on the scenario of flipping the coin \\( n = 5 \\) times. The probability of obtaining exactly \\( k \\) heads follows the binomial probability formula:\n\\[\nP(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the binomial coefficient.\n\nWe are particularly interested in the probabilities of getting exactly 1 head and exactly 2 heads:\n1. For exactly 1 head:\n\\[\nP(X = 1) = \\binom{5}{1} p^1 (1 - p)^{4} = 5p(1 - p)^4\n\\]\n2. For exactly 2 heads:\n\\[\nP(X = 2) = \\binom{5}{2} p^2 (1 - p)^{3} = 10p^2(1 - p)^3\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, these two probabilities are equal:\n\\[\n5p(1 - p)^4 = 10p^2(1 - p)^3\n\\]\n\nNext, we simplify this equation by cancelling \\( p \\) from both sides, assuming \\( p \\neq 0 \\):\n\\[\n5(1 - p)^4 = 10p(1 - p)^3\n\\]\n\nWe then divide both sides by \\( (1 - p)^3 \\) (as \\( 1 - p \\) must also be non-zero), yielding:\n\\[\n5(1 - p) = 10p\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\\[\n5 - 5p = 10p \\implies 5 = 15p \\implies p = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nNow that we have determined \\( p \\), we calculate the probability of obtaining exactly 3 heads out of 5 flips:\n\\[\nP(X = 3) = \\binom{5}{3} p^3 (1 - p)^{2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in our value of \\( p \\):\n\\[\nP(X = 3) = \\binom{5}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{3} = 10\n\\]\n\nPutting everything together:\n\\[\nP(X = 3) = 10 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{2} = 10 \\cdot \\frac{1}{27} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} = 10 \\cdot \\frac{4}{243} = \\frac{40}{243}\n\\]\n\nThis fraction \\( \\frac{40}{243} \\) is in simplest terms. We then identify \\( i + j \\) where \\( \\frac{i}{j} = \\frac{40}{243} \\). Here, \\( i = 40 \\) and \\( j = 243 \\).\n\nCalculating:\n\\[\ni + j = 40 + 243 = 283\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{283}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Denote the probability of getting a heads in one flip of the biased coin as $h$. Based upon the problem, note that ${5\\choose1}(h)^1(1-h)^4 = {5\\choose2}(h)^2(1-h)^3$. After canceling out terms, we get $1 - h = 2h$, so $h = \\frac{1}{3}$. The answer we are looking for is ${5\\choose3}(h)^3(1-h)^2 = 10\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{40}{243}$, so $i+j=40+243=\\boxed{283}$."
