  "problem": "An ancient human tribe had a hierarchical system where there existed one chief with 2 supporting chiefs (supporting chief A and supporting chief B), each of whom had 2 equal, inferior officers. If the tribe at one point had 10 members, what is the number of different ways to choose the leadership of the tribe?  That is, in how many ways can we choose a chief, 2 supporting chiefs, and two inferior officers reporting to each supporting chief?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of ways to select the leadership of a tribe with 10 members, we follow these steps based on the tribe's hierarchy:\n\n### Step 1: Choose the Chief\n- There are 10 possible members to choose from for the chief position.\n  \n**Choices for Chief = 10**\n\n### Step 2: Choose the Supporting Chiefs\n- After selecting the chief, 9 members remain. We select 2 supporting chiefs from these 9, where the order matters since the roles are distinct (Supporting Chief A and Supporting Chief B). Thus, we use permutations:\n\n\\[\nP(9, 2) = \\frac{9!}{(9 - 2)!} = 9 \\times 8 = 72\n\\]\n\n**Choices for Supporting Chiefs = 72**\n\n### Step 3: Choose Inferior Officers for Supporting Chief A\n- Next, we select 2 inferior officers for Supporting Chief A from the remaining 7 members. Since the order of selection does not matter, we use combinations:\n\n\\[\nC(7, 2) = \\frac{7!}{2!(7 - 2)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\n\\]\n\n**Choices for Inferior Officers under A = 21**\n\n### Step 4: Choose Inferior Officers for Supporting Chief B\n- Finally, we choose 2 inferior officers for Supporting Chief B from the remaining 5 members:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\n**Choices for Inferior Officers under B = 10**\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Total Combinations\nWe now combine all the choices made in the previous steps to find the total number of leadership structures:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Ways} = (\\text{Ways to choose Chief}) \\times (\\text{Ways to choose Supporting Chiefs}) \\times (\\text{Ways to choose Inferior Officers for A}) \\times (\\text{Ways to choose Inferior Officers for B})\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Ways} = 10 \\times 72 \\times 21 \\times 10\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Perform the Calculation\nPerforming the multiplication step-by-step:\n\n1. \\( 10 \\times 72 = 720 \\)\n2. \\( 720 \\times 21 = 15120 \\)\n3. \\( 15120 \\times 10 = 151200 \\)\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the total number of different ways to choose the leadership of the tribe is:\n\n**151200**",
  "ground_truth": "There are 10 choices for the chief.  For each choice, there are 9 ways to choose supporting chief A, then 8 ways to choose supporting chief B.  There are then $\\binom{7}{2}$ ways to choose the inferior officers for the supporting chief A and $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose the inferior officers for the supporting chief B.  This gives us a total of $10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot \\binom{7}{2}\\cdot\\binom{5}{2} = \\boxed{151200}$ ways to form the leadership of the tribe."
