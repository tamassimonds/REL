  "problem": "Mary chose an even $4$-digit number $n$. She wrote down all the divisors of $n$ in increasing order from left to right: $1,2,...,\\dfrac{n}{2},n$. At some moment Mary wrote $323$ as a divisor of $n$. What is the smallest possible value of the next divisor written to the right of $323$?\n$\\textbf{(A) } 324 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 330 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 340 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 361 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 646$\n",
  "solution": "To determine the smallest possible value of the next divisor written to the right of \\(323\\) in the list of divisors of an even 4-digit number \\(n\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Divisor Properties\nSince \\(323\\) is a divisor of \\(n\\), we express \\(n\\) as \\(n = 323k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). The next divisor after \\(323\\) must also be a divisor of \\(n\\).\n\n### Step 2: Prime Factorization of 323\nThe prime factorization of \\(323\\) is:\n\\[\n323 = 17 \\times 19\n\\]\nThe divisors of \\(323\\) include \\(1, 17, 19,\\) and \\(323\\).\n\n### Step 3: Finding Multiples of 323\nWe need to find the smallest integer \\(k\\) such that \\(n\\) remains an even 4-digit number:\n- For \\(k=4\\): \\(323 \\times 4 = 1292\\) (4-digit, even)\n- For \\(k=5\\): \\(323 \\times 5 = 1615\\) (4-digit, odd)\n- For \\(k=6\\): \\(323 \\times 6 = 1938\\) (4-digit, even)\n- Continue up to \\(k=20\\): \\(323 \\times 20 = 6460\\) (4-digit, even)\n\n### Step 4: Next Divisor After 323\nFrom \\(n\\) being a multiple of \\(323\\), we check the provided options for the next divisor after \\(323\\):\n- (A) \\(324\\)\n- (B) \\(330\\)\n- (C) \\(340\\)\n- (D) \\(361\\)\n- (E) \\(646\\)\n\nWe need to verify which of these options is greater than \\(323\\) and a divisor of \\(n\\).\n\n### Step 5: Check Each Option\n1. **\\(324\\)**: Not divisible by \\(17\\) or \\(19\\).\n2. **\\(330\\)**: Not divisible by \\(17\\) or \\(19\\).\n3. **\\(340\\)**: Checking:\n   \\[\n   340 \\div 17 = 20 \\quad (\\text{is a divisor})\n   \\]\n4. **\\(361\\)**: Not divisible by \\(17\\), but divisible by \\(19\\).\n5. **\\(646\\)**: Since it equals \\(323 \\times 2\\), it is valid and a multiple of \\(323\\).\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nAmong the options, \\(340\\) is the smallest number greater than \\(323\\) and also a multiple of \\(17\\). Therefore, the smallest possible value of the next divisor written to the right of \\(323\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{340}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "Since prime factorizing $323$ gives you $17 \\cdot 19$, the desired answer needs to be a multiple of $17$ or $19$, this is because if it is not a multiple of $17$ or $19$, $n$ will be more than a $4$ digit number. For example, if the answer were to instead be $324$, $n$ would have to be a multiple of $2^2 * 3^4 * 17 * 19$ for both $323$ and $324$ to be a valid factor, meaning $n$ would have to be at least $104652$, which is too big. Looking at the answer choices, $\\text{(A) }324$ and $\\text{(B) }330$ are both not a multiple of neither 17 nor 19, $\\text{(C) }340$ is divisible by $17$. $\\text{(D) }361$ is divisible by $19$, and $\\text{(E) }646$ is divisible by both $17$ and $19$. Since $\\boxed{340}$ is the smallest number divisible by either $17$ or $19$ it is the answer. Checking, we can see that $n$ would be $6460$, a four-digit number. Note that $n$ is also divisible by $2$, one of the listed divisors of $n$. (If $n$ was not divisible by $2$, we would need to look for a different divisor)"
