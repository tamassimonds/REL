  "problem": "Alex has 5 pieces of paper, each with a different math problem. In how many ways can he give these problems to his 10 friends (he can give each friend more than one problem)?",
  "solution": "To determine the number of ways Alex can distribute 5 unique pieces of paper (each containing a different math problem) to his 10 friends, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Choices for Each Problem\nEach math problem can be given to any of the 10 friends. Therefore, for every individual problem, there are 10 possible choices for the recipient.\n\n### Step 2: Total Combinations \nSince the distribution of each problem is independent of the others, we can multiply the number of choices for each problem together. This means:\n\n- Problem 1 has 10 choices,\n- Problem 2 has 10 choices,\n- Problem 3 has 10 choices,\n- Problem 4 has 10 choices,\n- Problem 5 has 10 choices.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Total\nThe total number of ways to distribute the 5 problems is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 10^5\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Computing the Result\nNow, we can compute \\(10^5\\):\n\n\\[\n10^5 = 100000\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the total number of ways Alex can distribute the 5 math problems to his 10 friends is **100000**. \n\n<ANSWER>100000 solution</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "For each of Alex's five problems, there are 10 friends he can give it to. Therefore, there are $10^5=\\boxed{100,\\!000}$ ways for Alex to distribute the problems."
