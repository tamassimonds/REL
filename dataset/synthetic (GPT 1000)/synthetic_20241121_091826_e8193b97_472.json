  "problem": "Two farmers agree that pigs are worth $\\$300$ and that goats are worth $\\$210$. When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with ``change'' received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary. (For example, a $\\$390$ debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way?",
  "solution": "To find the smallest positive debt that can be settled using pigs and goats, we start with the values of the animals:\n\n- A pig is valued at \\$300.\n- A goat is valued at \\$210.\n\nWhen one farmer pays a debt to another, the payment can be made in pigs or goats, with change given as necessary.\n\nTo model the debt, we let:\n- \\( p \\) = number of pigs\n- \\( g \\) = number of goats\n- \\( D \\) = total debt\n\nThus, the total debt can be expressed as:\n\\[\nD = 300p + 210g\n\\]\n\nTo simplify, we can factor out the greatest common divisor:\n\\[\nD = 30(10p + 7g)\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that \\( D \\) must be a multiple of 30. To find the smallest positive debt, we need to determine the smallest positive integer value of \\( 10p + 7g \\).\n\nNext, we apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find integer solutions to:\n\\[\n10p + 7g = 1\n\\]\n\nCalculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 10 and 7, we find:\n- \\( \\text{gcd}(10, 7) = 1 \\) (since they are coprime).\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we have:\n\\[\n10 = 1 \\cdot 7 + 3\n\\]\n\\[\n7 = 2 \\cdot 3 + 1\n\\]\n\\[\n3 = 3 \\cdot 1 + 0\n\\]\n\nBacktracking gives us:\n1. \\( 1 = 7 - 2 \\cdot 3 \\)\n2. Substitute \\( 3 = 10 - 1 \\cdot 7 \\):\n   \\[\n   1 = 7 - 2(10 - 1 \\cdot 7) = 3 \\cdot 7 - 2 \\cdot 10\n   \\]\n\nThis results in one solution for \\( p \\) and \\( g \\):\n- \\( p = -2 \\)\n- \\( g = 3 \\)\n\nTo find positive integers, we adjust \\( p \\) and \\( g \\) using:\n\\[\np = -2 + 7k \\\\\ng = 3 - 10k\n\\]\nfor integer \\( k \\).\n\nWe test different values of \\( k \\) to ensure both \\( p \\) and \\( g \\) are non-negative integers.\n\n1. For \\( k = 1 \\):\n   - \\( p = -2 + 7(1) = 5 \\)\n   - \\( g = 3 - 10(1) = -7\\) (not valid)\n  \n2. For \\( k = 0 \\):\n   - \\( p = -2 \\) (not valid)\n   - \\( g = 3 \\) \n  \n3. For \\( k = 2 \\):\n   - \\( p = -2 + 14 = 12 \\)\n   - \\( g = 3 - 20 = -17 \\) (not valid)\n\nContinuing this method will help us identify valid integer combinations.\n\nUltimately, through testing, the smallest positive debt \\( D \\) will be achieved through combinations yielding \\( D = 30 \\).\n\nThus, the smallest positive debt that can be resolved with combinations of pigs and goats is:\n\\[\n\\text{ANSWER} <30> \\text{ solution} \\text{.}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "If a debt of $D$ dollars can be resolved in this way, then integers $p$ and $g$ must exist with \\[\nD = 300p + 210g = 30(10p + 7g).\n\\]As a consequence, $D$ must be a multiple of 30, and  no positive debt less than $\\$30$ can be resolved. A debt of  $\\boxed{\\$30}$  can be resolved since \\[\n30 = 300(-2) + 210(3).\n\\]This is  done by giving 3 goats and receiving 2 pigs."
