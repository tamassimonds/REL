  "problem": "For a list of five positive integers, none greater than 100, the mean is 1.5 times the mode. If 31, 58, 98, $x$ and $x$ are the five integers, what is the value of $x$?",
  "solution": "To solve this problem, we are given a list of five positive integers: 31, 58, 98, \\( x \\), and \\( x \\), where \\( x \\) appears twice. The mean of these integers is stated to be 1.5 times the mode.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Mode\nThe mode is the value that appears most frequently in the list. Here, since \\( x \\) appears twice and is the only number that is repeated, \\( \\text{mode} = x \\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Mean\nThe mean is calculated as the total sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers. The sum can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 31 + 58 + 98 + x + x = 31 + 58 + 98 + 2x\n\\]\nCalculating the constant part:\n\\[\n31 + 58 + 98 = 187\n\\]\nThus, the sum becomes:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 187 + 2x\n\\]\nWith 5 numbers in total, the mean is:\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{187 + 2x}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Mean to the Mode\nThe problem specifies that the mean is 1.5 times the mode. Setting up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{187 + 2x}{5} = 1.5 \\cdot x\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Eliminate the Fraction\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 5:\n\\[\n187 + 2x = 7.5x\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Rearrange the Equation\nRearranging gives:\n\\[\n187 = 7.5x - 2x\n\\]\nCombining like terms results in:\n\\[\n187 = 5.5x\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Solve for \\( x \\)\nNow, we solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{187}{5.5}\n\\]\nCalculating this provides:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1870}{55} = \\frac{374}{11} \\approx 34\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Check the Conditions\nSince \\( x \\) must be a positive integer, we check \\( x = 34 \\).\n\n- The mode is \\( x = 34 \\).\n- The sum of the numbers is:\n\\[\n31 + 58 + 98 + 34 + 34 = 255\n\\]\n- Therefore, the mean is:\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{255}{5} = 51\n\\]\n\nNow, we verify that the mean is indeed 1.5 times the mode:\n\\[\n1.5 \\times 34 = 51\n\\]\n\nBoth conditions satisfy the problem's requirements.\n\nThus, the value of \\( x \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{34}\n\\] \n\nFinal answer:\n<ANSWER>34</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "The mean of the list 31, 58, 98, $x$ and $x$ is $(31+58+98+2x)/5=(187+2x)/5$, and the mode is $x$.  Solving $1.5x=(187+2x)/5$ we find $x=\\boxed{34}$."
