  "problem": "What is the domain of the function $$w(x) = \\sqrt{x-2} + \\sqrt[3]{x-3}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.",
  "solution": "To determine the domain of the function \\( w(x) = \\sqrt{x-2} + \\sqrt[3]{x-3} \\), we need to identify the values of \\( x \\) for which the function is defined.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the components\n\n1. **Square Root Function \\(\\sqrt{x-2}\\)**:\n   - The expression under the square root must be non-negative to be defined. Therefore, we establish the inequality:\n     \\[\n     x - 2 \\geq 0\n     \\]\n   - Solving this inequality yields:\n     \\[\n     x \\geq 2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Cube Root Function \\(\\sqrt[3]{x-3}\\)**:\n   - The cube root is defined for all real numbers, meaning there are no restrictions from this term.\n\n### Step 2: Combine the results\n\n- The only restriction we have is from the square root function, which requires \\( x \\) to be at least 2. The cube root does not impose any further limitations.\n\n### Step 3: Write the domain in interval notation\n\n- Consequently, the domain of the function comprises all values \\( x \\) such that \\( x \\) is equal to or greater than 2. In interval notation, this is expressed as:\n  \\[\n  [2, \\infty)\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, the domain of the function \\( w(x) \\) is:\n\n<ANSWER>[2, \\infty)</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Note that $\\sqrt[3]{x-3}$ is defined for all $x$. The only restriction is due to the $\\sqrt{x-2}$ term, which is defined only if $x-2$ is nonnegative. Thus, the domain of $w(x)$ is $\\boxed{[2,\\infty)}$."
