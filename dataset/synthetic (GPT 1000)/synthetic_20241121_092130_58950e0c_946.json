  "solution": "To determine the sum of the angle measurements of the tips of a 7-pointed star created by seven evenly spaced points on a circle, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Point Arrangement\nWe label the seven points on the circle as \\( A, B, C, D, E, F, G \\). The star is formed by connecting every second point, resulting in the following connections:\n- \\( A \\to C \\)\n- \\( C \\to E \\)\n- \\( E \\to G \\)\n- \\( G \\to B \\)\n- \\( B \\to D \\)\n- \\( D \\to F \\)\n- \\( F \\to A \\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Central Angles\nThe total angle around a circle is \\( 360^\\circ \\). Since the points are evenly spaced, the angle subtended at the center by each pair of adjacent points is:\n\\[\n\\text{Central angle} = \\frac{360^\\circ}{7}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Angle at Each Tip of the Star\nTo find the angle at a specific tip of the star, let's examine point \\( C \\). The angle at \\( C \\) (denoted as \\( \\alpha \\)) is formed by the segments \\( AC \\) and \\( CE \\). The arc \\( \\widehat{AE} \\) is traced by skipping points \\( B \\) and \\( D \\), covering three segments:\n\\[\n\\widehat{AE} = 3 \\cdot \\text{(Central angle)} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{360^\\circ}{7} = \\frac{1080^\\circ}{7}\n\\]\nThus, the angle \\( \\alpha \\) at tip \\( C \\) is half of the angle of arc \\( \\widehat{AE} \\):\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left( \\widehat{AE} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1080^\\circ}{7} = \\frac{540^\\circ}{7}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Sum of All Angles\nSince there are 7 tips in the star and each measures \\( \\frac{540^\\circ}{7} \\), the total sum of the angles at all the tips is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total angle sum} = 7 \\cdot \\alpha = 7 \\cdot \\frac{540^\\circ}{7} = 540^\\circ\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the sum of the angle measurements of the seven tips of the 7-pointed star is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{540}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The seven points divide the circumference of the circle into seven equal small arcs each with measure $\\frac{360^\\circ}{7}$.\n\n$\\angle ACE$ cuts off a minor arc $\\widehat{AE}$, which consists of three small arcs and thus \\[\\widehat{AE}=3\\cdot \\frac{360^\\circ}{7}.\\]It follows that \\[\\angle ACE = 3\\cdot \\frac{360^\\circ}{7} \\cdot\\frac{1}{ 2} = \\frac{3\\cdot 180^\\circ}{7}.\\]Each tip of the star is formed by an angle which cuts off three small arcs in a similar fashion.  Thus each tip of the star measures $\\frac{3\\cdot 180^\\circ}{7}$ and hence all seven tips of the star together measure $3\\cdot 180^\\circ = \\boxed{540}$ degrees."
