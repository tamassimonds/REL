  "solution": "To find the volume of the prism containing vertex \\(W\\) after two cuts on a unit cube, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Initial Setup\n\n1. The volume of the unit cube is \\(1\\).\n2. The first cut divides the cube into three triangular prisms: two congruent prisms and one unique prism.\n3. We will need to distribute the total volume of \\(1\\) among these three prisms.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the First Cut\n\n1. Let the volume of each congruent prism be \\(x\\) and the volume of the unique prism be \\(y\\).\n2. The relationship between these volumes is:\n   \\[\n   2x + y = 1\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Second Cut\n\n1. The second cut further divides the prisms. Each congruent prism is assumed to be split evenly.\n2. After the second cut, the volume of each half of the congruent prisms becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume of each half} = \\frac{x}{2}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 4: Locating Vertex \\(W\\)\n\n1. We need to establish where vertex \\(W\\) lies in relation to the triangular prisms formed by the cuts.\n2. If \\(W\\) is situated within one of the congruent prisms, we can focus on the volume associated with that prism.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Volume for the Piece Containing \\(W\\)\n\n1. Assuming \\(W\\) is in one of the congruent prisms, after the second cut, this prism is split into two pieces. Therefore, the volume for the piece containing \\(W\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume of piece containing } W = \\frac{x}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{x}{4}\n   \\]\n   This accounts for the two cuts resulting in four equal parts from the two congruent prisms.\n\n### Step 6: Substituting the Volumes\n\n1. We already have the earlier relationship \\(y = 1 - 2x\\).\n\n### Step 7: Finding Specific Values\n\n1. Given the symmetry of the cube and the cuts, we can assign:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n   This leads to:\n   \\[\n   y = 1 - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n\n2. Thus, the volume of the piece containing \\(W\\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume of piece containing } W = \\frac{x}{4} = \\frac{1/3}{4} = \\frac{1}{12}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the volume of the piece that contains vertex \\(W\\) after the two cuts is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{12}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The piece that contains $W$ is shown. It is a pyramid with vertices $V, W, X,Y$, and $Z$. Its base $WXYZ$  is a square with sides of length $1/2$ and its altitude $VW$ is 1.
