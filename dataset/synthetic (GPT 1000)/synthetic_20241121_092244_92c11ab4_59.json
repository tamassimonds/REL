  "problem": "After a gymnastics meet, each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself). Afterwards, a coach came down and only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team. There were a total of 281 handshakes. What is the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in?",
  "solution": "To solve the problem of counting the total handshakes during a gymnastics meet, we will analyze handshakes among gymnasts and those involving the coach.\n\n### Step 1: Count Handshakes Among Gymnasts\n\nLet \\( n \\) represent the total number of gymnasts. Each gymnast shakes hands with every other gymnast exactly once. The total number of handshakes among the gymnasts can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Handshakes among gymnasts} = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Handshakes Involving the Coach\n\nLet \\( m \\) denote the number of gymnasts on the coach's team. The coach shakes hands with each gymnast on her team, resulting in \\( m \\) handshakes.\n\n### Step 3: Total Handshakes\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the total number of handshakes, combining those among gymnasts and those with the coach, is given as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + m = 281\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Rearranging the Equation\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to express \\( m \\):\n\n\\[\nm = 281 - \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Finding Valid Values for \\( n \\)\n\nTo minimize \\( m \\), we need to maximize \\( n \\) under the constraint that \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\) does not exceed 281. We set up the inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\leq 281 \\implies n(n-1) \\leq 562\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us:\n\n\\[\nn^2 - n - 562 \\leq 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Finding Roots of the Quadratic\n\nWe solve the quadratic equation \\( n^2 - n - 562 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 4 \\cdot 562}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{2249}}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( \\sqrt{2249} \\) gives approximately 47.43, leading to:\n\n\\[\nn \\approx \\frac{1 + 47.43}{2} \\approx 24.215\n\\]\n\nThe largest integer value for \\( n \\) is therefore 24.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate \\( m \\)\n\nNow substituting \\( n = 24 \\) back into the equation to find \\( m \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{24(23)}{2} = 276\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation for \\( m \\):\n\n\\[\nm = 281 - 276 = 5\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the fewest number of handshakes that the coach could have participated in is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",
  "ground_truth": "The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \\choose 2}$ for some $n$. Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes. So, ${n \\choose 2} + k = 281$. If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \\choose 2} \\le 281$, which implies $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \\le 0 $. So, the maximal $n$ is 24. So, $k = 281 - {24 \\choose 2} = 281 - 12 \\cdot 23 = 281 - 276 = \\boxed{5}$."
