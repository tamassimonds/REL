  "problem": "For how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 474 inclusive does the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminate?",
  "solution": "To find how many integer values of \\( n \\) between 1 and 474 inclusive result in a terminating decimal for \\( \\frac{n}{475} \\), we must understand the conditions for a fraction to have a terminating decimal representation.\n\nA fraction \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) has a terminating decimal if, after simplification, the prime factorization of the denominator \\( b \\) includes only the primes 2 and 5.\n\n### Step 1: Factor the Denominator\n\nFirst, we factor \\( 475 \\):\n\n\\[\n475 = 5^2 \\times 19\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Condition for Termination\n\nFor \\( \\frac{n}{475} \\) to have a terminating decimal, the denominator \\( 475 \\) must not have any prime factors besides 2 and 5. In our case, \\( 19 \\) is present, so we need \\( n \\) to cancel out this factor.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Values of \\( n \\)\n\nTo eliminate the factor of 19 from the denominator, \\( n \\) must be a multiple of \\( 19 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Count Multiples of 19 from 1 to 474\n\nNext, we find the multiples of \\( 19 \\) within the range 1 to 474. We first calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{474}{19} \\approx 24.947\n\\]\n\nThe largest integer less than or equal to this quotient is \\( 24 \\). Therefore, the largest multiple of \\( 19 \\) not exceeding \\( 474 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n24 \\times 19 = 456\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: List the Multiples of 19\n\nThe multiples of \\( 19 \\) from \\( 19 \\) to \\( 456 \\) are:\n\n\\[\n19, 38, 57, 76, 95, 114, 133, 152, 171, 190, 209, 228, 247, 266, 285, 304, 323, 342, 361, 380, 399, 418, 437, 456\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Count the Multiples\n\nThese multiples form an arithmetic sequence with:\n\n- First term \\( a = 19 \\)\n- Common difference \\( d = 19 \\)\n\nThe number of terms, \\( m \\), in this sequence is given by \\( 19m \\leq 474 \\). Since we previously found \\( m = 24 \\), there are \\( 24 \\) multiples of \\( 19 \\) in the specified range.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the total number of integer values of \\( n \\) between 1 and 474 for which \\( \\frac{n}{475} \\) has a terminating decimal representation is:\n\n<ANSWER>24</ANSWER>",
  "ground_truth": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 475 as $5^2\\cdot 19$, we see that $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 19. There are 24 multiples of 19 from 1 to 474, so there are $\\boxed{24}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{475}$ a terminating decimal."
