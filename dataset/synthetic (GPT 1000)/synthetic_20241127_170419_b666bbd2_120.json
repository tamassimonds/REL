  "solution": "Alright, let's dive back into this problem. I\u2019ll reflect on my previous approach, identify where I went off track, and make the necessary corrections. Just like tackling a tricky question in real life, it's important to recognize when something doesn't quite add up and adjust accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Problem Again**\n\nOkay, so I need to find the fraction of clever integers (even numbers between 20 and 120 with a digit sum of 9) that are divisible by 27. Initially, I thought of listing all even numbers and checking their digit sums, but maybe I can streamline this process.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nThis involves properties of numbers\u2014digit sums and divisibility. It reminds me of problems where constraints on digits are key. Let's see if I can approach it differently this time.\n\n### **Brainstorming Strategies**\n\n1. **List All Numbers with Digit Sum 9:**  \n   - Identify all numbers between 20 and 120 whose digits add up to 9.\n   - Then filter out the even ones.\n\n2. **Use Mathematical Properties:**  \n   - Leverage the fact that the sum of digits being 9 imposes specific conditions.\n   - Apply divisibility rules for 27 afterward.\n\n3. **Combination of Both:**  \n   - Start by identifying all relevant numbers based on digit sums, then narrow down to even numbers.\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nListing all numbers with a digit sum of 9 seems more efficient than checking each even number individually. Let's try this approach.\n\n### **Step 1: Listing Numbers with Digit Sum of 9**\n\n**Reflection:**  \nInstead of listing all even numbers first, I'll focus on numbers whose digits add up to 9. This should simplify things.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**  \nI'll list all numbers between 20 and 120 where the sum of the digits is 9, regardless of whether they are even or odd, and then filter out the even ones.\n\n**Implementation:**  \nLet's create a list:\n\n- **27:** \\(2 + 7 = 9\\)\n- **36:** \\(3 + 6 = 9\\)\n- **45:** \\(4 + 5 = 9\\)\n- **54:** \\(5 + 4 = 9\\)\n- **63:** \\(6 + 3 = 9\\)\n- **72:** \\(7 + 2 = 9\\)\n- **81:** \\(8 + 1 = 9\\)\n- **90:** \\(9 + 0 = 9\\)\n- **108:** \\(1 + 0 + 8 = 9\\)\n- **117:** \\(1 + 1 + 7 = 9\\)\n\n**But Wait!**  \nI initially missed some numbers and included duplicates. Let's ensure we're capturing all unique numbers within the range.\n\n**Final List:**  \nAfter re-evaluating, the correct list is:\n\n- **27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117**\n\n<details>\n<summary>Hmm, looking at this again...</summary>\nWait a minute, 117 is greater than 120, so it shouldn't be included. Let's remove it.\n</details>\n\n**Corrected List:**  \n- **27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108**\n\n### **Step 2: Filtering Even Numbers (Clever Integers)**\n\n**Next Step:**  \nNow, I need to filter out the even numbers from this list since only even numbers qualify as clever integers.\n\n**Let\u2019s Do That:**  \n- **27:** Odd\n- **36:** Even\n- **45:** Odd\n- **54:** Even\n- **63:** Odd\n- **72:** Even\n- **81:** Odd\n- **90:** Even\n- **108:** Even\n\n**Clever Integers:**  \n- **36, 54, 72, 90, 108**\n\n<details>\n<summary>Actually, looking at this again...</summary>\nI initially missed the number 36 in my previous approach. It's clear now that there are five clever integers, not six.\n</details>\n\n**Realization:**  \nThere are **five** clever integers: 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108.\n\n### **Step 3: Checking Divisibility by 27**\n\n**Thoughts:**  \nNow, I need to determine which of these clever integers are divisible by 27.\n\n**Let\u2019s List Multiples of 27:**  \nWithin the range, the multiples of 27 are:\n\n- **27, 54, 81, 108**\n\n**Checking Against Clever Integers:**  \n- **36:** Not divisible by 27\n- **54:** Divisible by 27\n- **72:** Not divisible by 27\n- **90:** Not divisible by 27\n- **108:** Divisible by 27\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOnly **54** and **108** are divisible by 27.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Hmm, let me double-check my reasoning here...</summary>\nYes, both 54 and 108 are multiples of 27, so this makes sense.\n</details>\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Fraction**\n\n**Final Step:**  \nDetermine the fraction of clever integers that are divisible by 27.\n\n**Fraction Calculation:**  \nWe have **5** clever integers in total, and **2** of them are divisible by 27. So, the fraction is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\n\n**Simplifying the Fraction:**  \n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} \\text{ is already in its simplest form.}\n\\]\n\n<details>\n<summary>Wait, let me double-check that...</summary>\nYes, \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) is correct and cannot be simplified further.\n</details>\n\n### **Final Reflection: Does the Answer Make Sense?**\n\n**Checking:**  \nGiven the constraints, having 2 out of 5 clever integers divisible by 27 seems reasonable. It aligns with the strict conditions set by the problem.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n\\(\\frac{2}{5}\\)\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\(\\frac{2}{5}\\)\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nBy starting with listing all numbers whose digits sum to 9 and then filtering out the even ones, I streamlined the process and avoided missing any clever integers. Frequent checks and adjustments ensured accuracy, leading to the correct fraction of \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\).\n\nI see what I missed initially by not considering all relevant numbers and miscounting the clever integers. Reflecting on and revising my approach allowed me to arrive at the correct solution.",
  "ground_truth": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$."
