  "problem": "Ramanujan and Hardy played a game where they both picked a complex number. If the product of their numbers was $32-8i$, and Hardy picked $5+3i$, what number did Ramanujan pick?",
  "solution": "Alright, let's put this solution together neatly, maintaining the natural problem-solving flow but ensuring clarity and coherence. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to find Ramanujan's complex number given that the product of his number and Hardy\u2019s number \\(5 + 3i\\) is \\(32 - 8i\\).\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**  \nThe task involves complex numbers. To find Ramanujan's number, dividing the known product by Hardy\u2019s number seems like the logical step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Setting Up the Division**\n\nTo isolate Ramanujan's number, we'll set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Ramanujan's number} = \\frac{32 - 8i}{5 + 3i}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis approach makes sense\u2014solving for the unknown by dividing the product by the known factor.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Simplifying the Division Using Conjugates**\n\nTo divide complex numbers, we'll multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(5 + 3i\\) is \\(5 - 3i\\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{32 - 8i}{5 + 3i} \\times \\frac{5 - 3i}{5 - 3i}\n\\]\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n- **Denominator:**\n  \\[\n  (5 + 3i)(5 - 3i) = 5^2 - (3i)^2 = 25 - (-9) = 34\n  \\]\n  \n  **Check:**  \n  \\(i^2 = -1\\), so \\((3i)^2 = -9\\). The denominator simplifies to 34\u2014looks correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Multiplying the Numerator by the Conjugate**\n\nNow, let's handle the numerator:\n\n\\[\n(32 - 8i)(5 - 3i) = 32 \\times 5 + 32 \\times (-3i) + (-8i) \\times 5 + (-8i) \\times (-3i)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 160 - 96i - 40i + 24i^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= 160 - 136i + 24(-1)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 160 - 136i - 24\n\\]\n\\[\n= 136 - 136i\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nDouble-checking the calculations:\n\n- \\(32 \\times (-3i) = -96i\\)\n- \\((-8i) \\times 5 = -40i\\)\n- \\((-8i) \\times (-3i) = 24i^2 = -24\\)\n\nAdding them up yields \\(136 - 136i\\)\u2014seems correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Finalizing the Division**\n\nNow, divide the simplified numerator by the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{136 - 136i}{34} = \\frac{136}{34} - \\frac{136i}{34} = 4 - 4i\n\\]\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nSimplifying each component:\n\n- \\(\\frac{136}{34} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\frac{136i}{34} = 4i\\)\n\nSo, Ramanujan's number is \\(4 - 4i\\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**\n\nTo ensure correctness, let's multiply the found number by Hardy\u2019s number and check if we get the original product:\n\n\\[\n(4 - 4i)(5 + 3i) = 4 \\times 5 + 4 \\times 3i - 4i \\times 5 - 4i \\times 3i\n\\]\n\\[\n= 20 + 12i - 20i - 12i^2\n\\]\n\\[\n= 20 - 8i + 12\n\\]\n\\[\n= 32 - 8i\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe product matches the original \\(32 - 8i\\). This confirms that our solution is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n<ANSWER>  \nRamanujan's number is \\(4 - 4i\\).  \n</ANSWER>\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\n\n- **Was the strategy effective?**  \n  Yes, dividing the product by Hardy\u2019s number using conjugates led directly to the correct answer.\n\n- **Were there any errors?**  \n  No significant errors, but verifying the multiplication helped confirm the correctness.\n\n- **Is verification necessary?**  \n  Absolutely. Checking the solution by reversing the operation ensured accuracy.\n\n- **Could there have been a simpler method?**  \n  While polar coordinates were an option, using conjugates was the most straightforward and efficient approach.\n\n---\n\nBy systematically setting up the problem, applying the appropriate mathematical operations, and verifying the result, we've confidently arrived at Ramanujan's number.",
  "ground_truth": "Let Hardy's number be $h$ and Ramanujan's be $r$. We have the equations: \\begin{align*}\nrh&=32-8i,\\\\\nh&=5+3i.\n\\end{align*} Thus, \\[r=\\frac{32-8i}{5+3i}.\\] Multiplying top and bottom by the conjugate of $5+3i$, we have \\[r=\\frac{(32-8i)(5-3i)}{34}\\] or  \\[r=\\frac{136-136i}{34}=\\boxed{4-4i}\\]"
