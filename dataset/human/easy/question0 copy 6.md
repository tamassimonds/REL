### Question:
Find the three-digit positive integer $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ whose representation in base nine is $\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}},$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are (not necessarily distinct) digits.




### Answer:

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, just as I would approach it if I were solving it on paper. I'll walk you through my entire thought process, including brainstorming different strategies, encountering and overcoming obstacles, and verifying each step to ensure accuracy.

**Problem Statement:**
Find the three-digit positive integer \( \underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c} \) whose representation in base nine is \( \underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}_{\,\text{nine}} \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are digits.

**First Impressions:**
Okay, we're dealing with number bases here. We have a three-digit number in base ten (\( abc \)) that, when its digits are rearranged to \( bca \) and interpreted in base nine, equals the original number in base ten. This seems like a problem that involves converting between different bases and setting up an equation based on that relationship.

**Brainstorming Strategies:**
1. **Understanding Base Conversion:** I need to recall how to convert numbers from one base to another. Specifically, I should be able to express the base nine number \( bca_9 \) in base ten.
2. **Setting Up an Equation:** Once both numbers are in base ten, I can set up an equation to find the relationship between \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
3. **Solving for Digits:** After establishing the equation, I can solve for the digits \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), keeping in mind that they must be single-digit numbers (i.e., 0 through 9), and \( a \) cannot be zero since it's a three-digit number.

**Let's Dive In:**

**Step 1: Express Both Numbers in Base Ten**

- The original number in base ten is straightforward: \( N = 100a + 10b + c \).
- The rearranged number \( bca \) in base nine needs to be converted to base ten. To do this:
  \[
  [bca]_9 = b \times 9^2 + c \times 9^1 + a \times 9^0 = 81b + 9c + a
  \]

**Step 2: Establish the Relationship**

According to the problem, these two representations are equal:
\[
100a + 10b + c = 81b + 9c + a
\]

**Step 3: Simplify the Equation**

Let's bring all terms to one side to simplify:
\[
100a + 10b + c - 81b - 9c - a = 0 \\
(100a - a) + (10b - 81b) + (c - 9c) = 0 \\
99a - 71b - 8c = 0
\]

So, we have:
\[
99a = 71b + 8c
\]

**Step 4: Analyze the Equation**

This equation must hold true for single-digit integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) where \( a \neq 0 \). Given that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are digits (0-9), we can consider the possible values for \( a \) and see if corresponding \( b \) and \( c \) values satisfy the equation.

**Step 5: Trial and Error with Constraints**

Since \( a \) must be between 1 and 9, let's iterate through possible values of \( a \) and see if we can find corresponding \( b \) and \( c \) that satisfy the equation.

**Case 1: \( a = 1 \)**
\[
99(1) = 71b + 8c \\
99 = 71b + 8c
\]
Looking for integer solutions where \( b \) and \( c \) are digits:
- If \( b = 1 \): \( 71(1) + 8c = 99 \Rightarrow 8c = 28 \Rightarrow c = 3.5 \) (Not an integer)
- \( b = 0 \): \( 71(0) + 8c = 99 \Rightarrow 8c = 99 \Rightarrow c = 12.375 \) (Exceeds single-digit)
- \( b = 2 \): \( 71(2) + 8c = 99 \Rightarrow 142 + 8c = 99 \Rightarrow 8c = -43 \) (Negative, invalid)

**Conclusion for \( a = 1 \):** No valid \( b \) and \( c \) satisfy the equation.

**Case 2: \( a = 2 \)**
\[
99(2) = 71b + 8c \\
198 = 71b + 8c
\]
Looking for integer solutions:
- Let's solve for \( b \): \( 71b = 198 - 8c \Rightarrow b = \frac{198 - 8c}{71} \)
- Since \( b \) must be an integer, \( 198 - 8c \) must be divisible by 71.
- Let's find \( c \) such that \( 198 - 8c \) is divisible by 71.

Calculate \( 198 \mod 71 \):
\[
198 รท 71 = 2 \text{ with a remainder of } 56 \\
198 \equiv 56 \pmod{71}
\]
So:
\[
56 - 8c \equiv 0 \pmod{71} \\
-8c \equiv -56 \pmod{71} \\
8c \equiv 56 \pmod{71}
\]
Now, divide both sides by 8:
\[
c \equiv 7 \pmod{71} \quad (\text{since } 8 \times 9 = 72 \equiv 1 \pmod{71})
\]
Thus, \( c = 7 \) (since \( c \) must be a single-digit number).

Now, find \( b \):
\[
b = \frac{198 - 8(7)}{71} = \frac{198 - 56}{71} = \frac{142}{71} = 2
\]
So, \( a = 2 \), \( b = 2 \), \( c = 7 \).

**Quick Check:**
Let's verify if these values satisfy the original condition.

Original number in base ten:
\[
N = 100(2) + 10(2) + 7 = 200 + 20 + 7 = 227
\]
Rearranged number in base nine:
\[
[2\,7\,2]_9 = 2 \times 81 + 7 \times 9 + 2 \times 1 = 162 + 63 + 2 = 227
\]
**Verification:** Both representations equal 227 in base ten. It checks out!

**Case 3: \( a = 3 \)**
\[
99(3) = 71b + 8c \\
297 = 71b + 8c
\]
Attempting to find integer solutions for \( b \) and \( c \):
- Solving \( b = \frac{297 - 8c}{71} \)
- For \( c \) to be a digit, let's see if \( 297 - 8c \) is divisible by 71.

Calculate \( 297 \mod 71 \):
\[
297 รท 71 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 13 \\
297 \equiv 13 \pmod{71}
\]
So:
\[
13 - 8c \equiv 0 \pmod{71} \\
-8c \equiv -13 \pmod{71} \\
8c \equiv 13 \pmod{71}
\]
Solving for \( c \):
\[
c \equiv 13 \times 9 \pmod{71} \quad (\text{since } 8 \times 9 = 72 \equiv 1 \pmod{71}) \\
c \equiv 117 \pmod{71} \\
c \equiv 46 \pmod{71}
\]
Since \( c \) must be a single-digit number, there's no valid \( c \) for \( a = 3 \).

**Conclusion for \( a = 3 \):** No valid \( b \) and \( c \) satisfy the equation.

**Observing a Pattern:**
From the cases above, it seems that only \( a = 2 \) yields valid digits \( b \) and \( c \). Let's test one more case to confirm.

**Case 4: \( a = 4 \)**
\[
99(4) = 71b + 8c \\
396 = 71b + 8c
\]
Attempting to find integer solutions:
\[
b = \frac{396 - 8c}{71}
\]
Check if \( 396 - 8c \) is divisible by 71:
\[
396 รท 71 = 5 \text{ with a remainder of } 31 \\
396 \equiv 31 \pmod{71}
\]
So:
\[
31 - 8c \equiv 0 \pmod{71} \\
-8c \equiv -31 \pmod{71} \\
8c \equiv 31 \pmod{71}
\]
Solving for \( c \):
\[
c \equiv 31 \times 9 \pmod{71} \quad (\text{since } 8 \times 9 = 72 \equiv 1 \pmod{71}) \\
c \equiv 279 \pmod{71} \\
c \equiv 66 \pmod{71}
\]
Again, \( c = 66 \) is not a single-digit number, so no solution exists for \( a = 4 \).

**Final Thoughts:**
Given the pattern observed and the unsuccessful attempts with \( a = 1, 3, 4 \), it's reasonable to conclude that \( a = 2 \) is the only valid case where \( b \) and \( c \) are single-digit numbers satisfying the equation.

**Final Answer:**
The three-digit positive integer is \( \boxed{227} \).
