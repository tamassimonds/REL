### Question:

Find the number of ways $66$ identical coins can be separated into three nonempty piles so that there are fewer coins in the first pile than in the second pile and fewer coins in the second pile than in the third pile.


### Answer:

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to partition 66 identical coins into three distinct, nonempty piles such that the number of coins in each pile increases from the first to the third (i.e., \( a < b < c \)), and \( a + b + c = 66 \).

**Step 1: Set Up the Problem**

Let \( a, b, \) and \( c \) be positive integers representing the number of coins in each pile. We have:

1. \( a + b + c = 66 \)
2. \( a < b < c \)

**Step 2: Express \( b \) and \( c \) in Terms of \( a \) and \( k \)**

Since \( b > a \), let \( b = a + k \), where \( k \geq 1 \).

Similarly, \( c = 66 - a - b = 66 - a - (a + k) = 66 - 2a - k \).

**Step 3: Apply the Inequality \( c > b \)**

We need \( c > b \), so:

\[
66 - 2a - k > a + k
\]
\[
66 - 2a - k - a - k > 0
\]
\[
66 - 3a - 2k > 0
\]

**Step 4: Find Valid Values of \( a \) and \( k \)**

We need to find positive integers \( a \) and \( k \) such that:

\[
3a + 2k < 66
\]

Since \( k \geq 1 \) and \( a \geq 1 \), we can calculate the maximum possible value of \( a \):

\[
3a + 2 \times 1 \leq 65 \implies a \leq 21
\]

**Step 5: Compute the Number of Valid \( k \) for Each \( a \)**

For each \( a \) from 1 to 21, calculate the maximum \( k \) such that \( 3a + 2k \leq 65 \):

- For \( a = 1 \): \( 3(1) + 2k \leq 65 \implies k \leq 31 \)
- For \( a = 2 \): \( k \leq 29 \)
- ...
- Continue this process up to \( a = 21 \): \( k \leq 1 \)

**Step 6: Sum the Number of Valid \( k \) Values**

Add up the number of valid \( k \) values for each \( a \):

\[
\text{Total ways} = 31 + 29 + 28 + 26 + 25 + 23 + 22 + 20 + 19 + 17 + 16 + 14 + 13 + 11 + 10 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 331
\]

**Conclusion:**

There are **331** ways to partition 66 identical coins into three nonempty piles with increasing quantities.

\(\boxed{331}\)
