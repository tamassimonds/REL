### Question:
Five men and nine women stand equally spaced around a circle in random order. The probability that every man stands diametrically opposite a woman is $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$


### Answer:

Alright, let's tackle this probability problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies and adjusting as needed to arrive at the correct solution.

**Problem Recap:**
We have five men and nine women randomly arranged around a circle with 14 equally spaced positions. We need to find the probability that every man stands diametrically opposite a woman. The final probability should be expressed as a reduced fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\), and we need to find \(m + n\).

**Step 1: Understanding the Setup**

First, I want to visualize the circle. There are 14 positions, which is an even number. This is important because it allows each position to have a diametrically opposite position. Specifically, position \(i\) is opposite position \((i + 7) \mod 14\).

So, we can pair up the positions as follows:
\[
(0,7),\ (1,8),\ (2,9),\ (3,10),\ (4,11),\ (5,12),\ (6,13)
\]
There are 7 such pairs.

**Step 2: Total Number of Arrangements**

Before diving into the favorable arrangements, let's determine the total number of possible ways to arrange the five men and nine women around the circle.

Since the circle is fixed (no rotations considered distinct), the number of ways to arrange the people is the number of ways to choose 5 positions out of 14 for the men, and the rest will naturally be occupied by women.

\[
\text{Total arrangements} = \binom{14}{5}
\]

Calculating this:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5! \times 9!} = 2002
\]
So, there are 2002 total possible arrangements.

**Step 3: Favorable Arrangements**

Now, we need to find the number of arrangements where every man is diametrically opposite a woman. This condition implies that in each pair of opposite positions, at most one can be occupied by a man.

Let's break this down:

1. **Choosing Pairs for Men:**
   - There are 7 pairs of opposite positions.
   - We need to place 5 men, each in a unique pair (since each man must be opposite a woman).
   - So, we first choose 5 out of the 7 pairs to place the men.

   \[
   \binom{7}{5} = 21
   \]

2. **Assigning Positions Within Each Selected Pair:**
   - For each selected pair, the man can be in either of the two positions.
   - So, for each of the 5 selected pairs, there are 2 choices.

   \[
   2^5 = 32
   \]

3. **Total Favorable Arrangements:**
   - Multiply the number of ways to choose the pairs by the number of ways to assign the men within those pairs.

   \[
   \text{Favorable arrangements} = 21 \times 32 = 672
   \]

**Reflection:**
At this point, it seems straightforward, but I want to double-check to ensure that no overcounting or undercounting is happening. Specifically, I need to confirm that by selecting 5 unique pairs and assigning one position per pair to a man, we're not violating any conditions of the problem.

Given that each man is placed in a distinct pair and the opposite position is automatically occupied by a woman, it aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements.

**Step 4: Calculating the Probability**

With the total number of arrangements and the number of favorable arrangements determined, the probability \(P\) that every man stands diametrically opposite a woman is:

\[
P = \frac{\text{Favorable arrangements}}{\text{Total arrangements}} = \frac{672}{2002}
\]

**Step 5: Simplifying the Fraction**

To express this probability in its simplest form, we need to reduce the fraction \(\frac{672}{2002}\).

1. **Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
   - Let's factor both numbers to find their GCD.

   \[
   672 = 2^5 \times 3 \times 7 \\
   2002 = 2 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13
   \]
   - The common factors are \(2\) and \(7\), so the GCD is \(2 \times 7 = 14\).

2. **Divide Numerator and Denominator by GCD:**
   \[
   \frac{672 \div 14}{2002 \div 14} = \frac{48}{143}
   \]

**Step 6: Final Answer**

Now, the probability in its reduced form is \(\frac{48}{143}\). To find \(m + n\), where \(\frac{m}{n} = \frac{48}{143}\):

\[
m = 48, \quad n = 143 \\
m + n = 48 + 143 = 191
\]

**Conclusion:**
After carefully exploring and verifying each step, the final answer is **191**.
