### Question:

Zou and Chou are practicing their $100$-meter sprints by running $6$ races against each other. Zou wins the first race, and after that, the probability that one of them wins a race is $\frac23$ if they won the previous race but only $\frac13$ if they lost the previous race. The probability that Zou will win exactly $5$ of the $6$ races is $\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$

### Answer:

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, thinking through different strategies and checking our work along the way to ensure accuracy.

**Problem Recap:**
Zou and Chou are running 6 races. Zou wins the first race. After that:
- If a runner won the previous race, they have a \( \frac{2}{3} \) chance to win the next race.
- If a runner lost the previous race, they have a \( \frac{1}{3} \) chance to win the next race.

We need to find the probability that Zou wins exactly 5 out of the 6 races. The probability should be expressed as \( \frac{m}{n} \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime positive integers, and then compute \( m + n \).

**First Thoughts:**
- Since Zou wins the first race, we have a fixed starting point.
- We need to consider the outcomes of the remaining 5 races, where Zou needs to win 4 more races (to total 5 wins out of 6).
- The probability of winning each race depends on the outcome of the previous race.
- It seems like a problem involving conditional probabilities and possibly sequences of wins and losses.

**Brainstorming Strategies:**
1. **Enumerate All Possible Sequences:**
   - List all possible sequences of wins (W) and losses (L) over the 6 races where Zou wins exactly 5.
   - Calculate the probability for each sequence and sum them up.

2. **Use Recursion or Dynamic Programming:**
   - Define states based on the current race number, the number of wins so far, and who won the previous race.
   - Use these states to build up the probability step by step.

3. **Markov Chains:**
   - Model the races as states with transition probabilities based on the previous outcome.
   - Compute the probability of ending in a state with exactly 5 wins.

**Trying Strategy 1: Enumerate All Possible Sequences**

Given that Zou wins the first race, we're dealing with races 2 through 6, needing exactly 4 more wins.

Possible positions for the single loss (since total wins are 5):

- Loss in Race 2
- Loss in Race 3
- Loss in Race 4
- Loss in Race 5
- Loss in Race 6

So, there are 5 possible sequences where Zou loses exactly once in races 2-6.

**Sequence 1: Loss in Race 2**
- Race 1: W (given)
- Race 2: L
- Races 3-6: W

Let's calculate the probability step by step:

1. **Race 1 to Race 2:**
   - Since Zou won Race 1, the probability he loses Race 2 is \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \).

2. **Race 2 to Race 3:**
   - Zou lost Race 2, so the probability he wins Race 3 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

3. **Race 3 to Race 4:**
   - Zou won Race 3, so the probability he wins Race 4 is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

4. **Race 4 to Race 5:**
   - Zou won Race 4, so the probability he wins Race 5 is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

5. **Race 5 to Race 6:**
   - Zou won Race 5, so the probability he wins Race 6 is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

Multiplying these probabilities:
\[
1 \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{243}
\]

**Sequence 2: Loss in Race 3**
- Races 1-2: W, W
- Race 3: L
- Races 4-6: W

Calculating the probabilities:

1. **Race 1 to Race 2:**
   - Won Race 1, probability to win Race 2: \( \frac{2}{3} \).

2. **Race 2 to Race 3:**
   - Won Race 2, probability to lose Race 3: \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \).

3. **Race 3 to Race 4:**
   - Lost Race 3, probability to win Race 4: \( \frac{1}{3} \).

4. **Race 4 to Race 5:**
   - Won Race 4, probability to win Race 5: \( \frac{2}{3} \).

5. **Race 5 to Race 6:**
   - Won Race 5, probability to win Race 6: \( \frac{2}{3} \).

Multiplying:
\[
1 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{243}
\]

**Sequence 3: Loss in Race 4**
- Races 1-3: W, W, W
- Race 4: L
- Races 5-6: W

Calculating probabilities:

1. **Race 1 to Race 2:**
   - Won Race 1, probability to win Race 2: \( \frac{2}{3} \).

2. **Race 2 to Race 3:**
   - Won Race 2, probability to win Race 3: \( \frac{2}{3} \).

3. **Race 3 to Race 4:**
   - Won Race 3, probability to lose Race 4: \( \frac{1}{3} \).

4. **Race 4 to Race 5:**
   - Lost Race 4, probability to win Race 5: \( \frac{1}{3} \).

5. **Race 5 to Race 6:**
   - Won Race 5, probability to win Race 6: \( \frac{2}{3} \).

Multiplying:
\[
1 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{243}
\]

**Sequence 4: Loss in Race 5**
- Races 1-4: W, W, W, W
- Race 5: L
- Race 6: W

Calculating probabilities:

1. **Race 1 to Race 2:**
   - Won Race 1, probability to win Race 2: \( \frac{2}{3} \).

2. **Race 2 to Race 3:**
   - Won Race 2, probability to win Race 3: \( \frac{2}{3} \).

3. **Race 3 to Race 4:**
   - Won Race 3, probability to win Race 4: \( \frac{2}{3} \).

4. **Race 4 to Race 5:**
   - Won Race 4, probability to lose Race 5: \( \frac{1}{3} \).

5. **Race 5 to Race 6:**
   - Lost Race 5, probability to win Race 6: \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Multiplying:
\[
1 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{8}{243}
\]

**Sequence 5: Loss in Race 6**
- Races 1-5: W, W, W, W, W
- Race 6: L

Calculating probabilities:

1. **Race 1 to Race 2:**
   - Won Race 1, probability to win Race 2: \( \frac{2}{3} \).

2. **Race 2 to Race 3:**
   - Won Race 2, probability to win Race 3: \( \frac{2}{3} \).

3. **Race 3 to Race 4:**
   - Won Race 3, probability to win Race 4: \( \frac{2}{3} \).

4. **Race 4 to Race 5:**
   - Won Race 4, probability to win Race 5: \( \frac{2}{3} \).

5. **Race 5 to Race 6:**
   - Won Race 5, probability to lose Race 6: \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Multiplying:
\[
1 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{16}{243}
\]

**Adding Up the Probabilities:**
Now, sum the probabilities of all five sequences:

\[
\frac{8}{243} + \frac{8}{243} + \frac{8}{243} + \frac{8}{243} + \frac{16}{243} = \frac{48}{243}
\]

**Simplifying the Fraction:**
\[
\frac{48}{243} = \frac{16}{81}
\]

**Verification:**
- All five sequences should sum up to the total probability.
- Each sequence's probability calculation seems consistent.
- The final fraction simplifies correctly.

**Conclusion:**
The probability that Zou wins exactly 5 out of the 6 races is \( \frac{16}{81} \).

Therefore, \( m = 16 \) and \( n = 81 \), so \( m + n = 97 \).

\(\boxed{97}\)
