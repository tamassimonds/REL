Problem Recap
Ellina has twelve blocks, with two blocks each of six distinct colors: Red (R), Blue (B), Yellow (Y), Green (G), Orange (O), and Purple (P). An arrangement of these blocks is considered even if, for each color, there is an even number of blocks between its two instances.

Our goal is to determine the probability that a random arrangement of these blocks is even. Specifically, we need to express this probability as a reduced fraction 
𝑚
𝑛
n
m
​
  and find the sum 
𝑚
+
𝑛
m+n.

Step 1: Understanding the "Even" Arrangement
Before jumping into calculations, it's crucial to fully grasp what constitutes an even arrangement.

Definition: An arrangement is even if, for each pair of blocks of the same color, the number of blocks between them is even.

Implication: If there are an even number of blocks between two blocks of the same color, the positions of these blocks differ by an odd number. For example, if one block is in position 2 and the other in position 5, there are 
5
−
2
−
1
=
2
5−2−1=2 blocks between them (which is even), and the distance is 
5
−
2
=
3
5−2=3 (which is odd).

Parity Consideration: Positions in the row can be categorized as odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) and even (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12). For two blocks of the same color to be an odd distance apart, one must occupy an odd position and the other an even position.

Reflection: This parity insight is crucial. It suggests that arranging one block of each color in odd positions and the other in even positions inherently satisfies the "even" arrangement condition.

Step 2: Calculating the Total Number of Arrangements
To determine the probability, we first need to know the total number of possible arrangements of the twelve blocks.

Total Blocks: 12
Distinct Colors: 6, each appearing exactly twice.
Formula: Since blocks of the same color are indistinguishable, the total number of distinct arrangements is given by the multinomial coefficient:

Total arrangements
=
12
!
(
2
!
)
6
Total arrangements= 
(2!) 
6
 
12!
​
 
Explanation: The denominator accounts for the fact that swapping two blocks of the same color doesn't produce a new arrangement. Each of the six colors has two identical blocks, hence 
(
2
!
)
6
(2!) 
6
 .

Calculation:

12
!

479001600
(

6

64
Total arrangements
=
479001600

7484400
12!=479001600
(2!) 
6
 =64
Total arrangements= 
64
479001600
​
 =7484400
Step 3: Determining Favorable Arrangements (Even Arrangements)
Next, we need to calculate the number of arrangements that satisfy the "even" condition.

Strategy 1: Assigning Colors to Odd and Even Positions
Assigning One Block of Each Color to Odd Positions:

Odd Positions Available: 6 (positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)
Number of Colors: 6
Number of Ways: 
6
!
6! (since each color must occupy one unique odd position)
Assigning the Remaining Block of Each Color to Even Positions:

Even Positions Available: 6 (positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12)
Number of Colors: 6
Number of Ways: 
6
!
6! (each remaining block must occupy a unique even position)
Total Favorable Arrangements:

Favorable arrangements
=
6
!
×
6
!
=
(
6
!
)
2
Favorable arrangements=6!×6!=(6!) 
2
 
Calculation:

6
!
=
720
(
6

)
2
=
720
×
720
=
518400
6!=720
(6!) 
2
 =720×720=518400
Reflection: This method intuitively pairs each color's blocks across odd and even positions, ensuring the "even" condition is met for all colors simultaneously.

Step 4: Calculating the Probability
With both the total and favorable arrangements known, the probability 
𝑃
P of an even arrangement is:

𝑃
=

Step 6: Verifying the Solution Using an Alternative Method
To ensure the correctness of our solution, let's approach the problem using probability principles rather than combinatorial arrangements.

Probability Approach: Sequential Placement
Assign Positions to Blocks One by One:

There are 12 positions to fill with 12 blocks.
We will place blocks sequentially, ensuring that for each color, one block is in an odd position and the other in an even position.
Calculating the Probability for Each Color:

First Block of a Color:

Can be placed in any of the 12 positions.
Choices: 12
Second Block of the Same Color:

Must be placed in a position of opposite parity to the first block's position.
If the first block is in an odd position, the second must be in an even position, and vice versa.
Available Positions After First Placement: 6 of the opposite parity.
Generalizing for All Colors:

First Color:

Place the first block: 12 choices.
Place the second block: 6 choices (opposite parity).
Total for First Color: 
12
×
6
12×6
Second Color:

Place the first block: 10 choices remaining.
Place the second block: 5 choices (since one position of each parity is already taken).

But Wait!

This seems inconsistent with our previous combinatorial approach. The discrepancy arises because this method counts each distinct arrangement multiple times due to indistinguishable blocks of the same color.

Reflection: To reconcile this, we need to account for the indistinguishability of blocks within the same color. Specifically, since swapping two blocks of the same color doesn't create a new unique arrangement, we've overcounted.

Adjusting for Indistinguishability:

For each color, swapping the two blocks doesn't create a new arrangement. Since there are 6 colors, we've overcounted by a factor of 
2
6
=
64

 =64.
