### Question:
Each vertex of a regular dodecagon ($12$-gon) is to be colored either red or blue, and thus there are $2^{12}$ possible colorings. Find the number of these colorings with the property that no four vertices colored the same color are the four vertices of a rectangle.


### Answer:

Alright, let's tackle this problem together. We'll approach it step-by-step, exploring different strategies, checking our progress along the way, and adjusting our methods as needed. Here's the problem again for clarity:

**Problem:**  
Each vertex of a regular dodecagon (12-gon) is to be colored either red or blue, resulting in \(2^{12}\) possible colorings. We need to find the number of these colorings where no four vertices colored the same color form the vertices of a rectangle.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

**Brainstorming:**
- **Total Colorings:** First, since each of the 12 vertices can be colored red or blue independently, there are \(2^{12} = 4096\) total possible colorings.
- **Forbidden Configurations:** We need to exclude colorings where four vertices of the same color form a rectangle.
- **Regular Dodecagon:** In a regular 12-gon, what qualifies as a rectangle? Typically, rectangles in polygons are sets of four vertices where pairs of sides are parallel and equal in length.

**Reflection:**  
I need to identify all possible rectangles within the dodecagon to ensure none of them are monochromatic (all red or all blue).

---

### **Step 2: Identifying Rectangles in the Dodecagon**

**Brainstorming:**
- In a regular dodecagon, rectangles would be sets of four vertices where opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- Given the symmetry of the regular dodecagon, rectangles are likely formed by selecting every third vertex.

**Exploring the Structure:**
- Label the vertices from \(V_0\) to \(V_{11}\).
- Starting at \(V_0\), if we select every third vertex: \(V_0\), \(V_3\), \(V_6\), \(V_9\).
- Similarly, starting at \(V_1\): \(V_1\), \(V_4\), \(V_7\), \(V_{10}\).
- And starting at \(V_2\): \(V_2\), \(V_5\), \(V_8\), \(V_{11}\).

**Conclusion:**  
There are **three distinct rectangles** in the dodecagon:
1. \(R_1\): \(V_0\), \(V_3\), \(V_6\), \(V_9\)
2. \(R_2\): \(V_1\), \(V_4\), \(V_7\), \(V_{10}\)
3. \(R_3\): \(V_2\), \(V_5\), \(V_8\), \(V_{11}\)

**Quick Check:**  
Does each rectangle share any vertices with another?  
- \(R_1\) has vertices \(0, 3, 6, 9\)  
- \(R_2\) has vertices \(1, 4, 7, 10\)  
- \(R_3\) has vertices \(2, 5, 8, 11\)  
  
No overlaps. Each rectangle is disjoint from the others.

---

### **Step 3: Applying the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**

**Brainstorming:**
- We need to count all colorings where **none** of the rectangles \(R_1\), \(R_2\), or \(R_3\) are monochromatic.
- It might be easier to first count the colorings where **at least one** rectangle is monochromatic and then subtract that from the total colorings.

**Setting Up:**
- Let \(A_i\) be the event that rectangle \(R_i\) is monochromatic (all red or all blue).
- We need to find \(|A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3|\), the number of colorings where at least one rectangle is monochromatic.

**Calculating Individual Events:**
- **For a single rectangle \(A_i\):**
  - There are 2 choices for the color of the rectangle (all red or all blue).
  - The remaining 8 vertices can be colored freely, so \(2^8 = 256\) colorings.
  - Therefore, \(|A_i| = 2 \times 256 = 512\).

**Calculating Pairwise Intersections:**
- **For two rectangles \(A_i \cap A_j\):**
  - Each rectangle must be monochromatic, independently.
  - 2 choices for the color of \(R_i\) and 2 choices for \(R_j\), totaling \(2 \times 2 = 4\) colorings.
  - The remaining 4 vertices can be colored freely: \(2^4 = 16\) colorings.
  - Therefore, \(|A_i \cap A_j| = 4 \times 16 = 64\).

**Calculating Triple Intersection:**
- **For all three rectangles \(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3\):**
  - Each rectangle must be monochromatic.
  - 2 choices for each rectangle's color: \(2^3 = 8\) colorings.
  - No remaining vertices left to color.
  - Therefore, \(|A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3| = 8\).

**Applying Inclusion-Exclusion:**
\[
|A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3| = |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3| - |A_1 \cap A_2| - |A_1 \cap A_3| - |A_2 \cap A_3| + |A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3|
\]
\[
= 3 \times 512 - 3 \times 64 + 8 = 1536 - 192 + 8 = 1352
\]

**Quick Reflection:**  
This number represents all colorings where **at least one** rectangle is monochromatic. To find colorings where **no** rectangle is monochromatic, we'll subtract this from the total number of colorings.

---

### **Step 4: Final Calculation**

**Total Valid Colorings:**
\[
\text{Valid colorings} = \text{Total colorings} - |A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3| = 4096 - 1352 = 2744
\]

**Final Answer:**  
There are **2,744** valid colorings where no four vertices of the same color form the vertices of a rectangle.

---

### **Final Check**

**Sanity Check:**
- The total number of colorings is \(4096\), and we're subtracting \(1352\) invalid colorings, leaving \(2744\).
- Since each rectangle has a relatively small probability of being monochromatic, this number seems plausible.

**Additional Reflection:**  
Given that the rectangles are disjoint, the inclusion-exclusion principle was straightforward to apply without worrying about overlapping rectangles. If the rectangles shared vertices, the calculations would have been more complex.

---

Let me double check my answer before I submit it.

Alright, let's revisit the problem to ensure our solution is both accurate and thorough. Initially, I applied the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle and arrived at an answer of **2,744** valid colorings. However, something doesn't feel quite right. Let me take a step back, re-examine my approach, and explore alternative strategies to verify the correctness of the solution.

---

### **Problem Recap**

**Problem Statement:**  
Each vertex of a regular dodecagon (12-gon) is to be colored either red or blue, resulting in \(2^{12} = 4096\) possible colorings. We need to determine the number of these colorings where no four vertices of the same color form the vertices of a rectangle.

---

### **Initial Approach: Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**

**Step 1: Identifying Rectangles**

- **Rectangles in a Dodecagon:**  
  In a regular dodecagon, rectangles are formed by selecting two distinct pairs of opposite vertices. Due to the symmetry, there are **three distinct rectangles**:
  1. \(R_1\): \(V_0, V_3, V_6, V_9\)
  2. \(R_2\): \(V_1, V_4, V_7, V_{10}\)
  3. \(R_3\): \(V_2, V_5, V_8, V_{11}\)

**Step 2: Applying Inclusion-Exclusion**

- **Total Colorings:** \(2^{12} = 4096\)
  
- **Monochromatic Rectangles:**  
  - Each rectangle can be entirely red or entirely blue.
  - For each rectangle, the number of colorings where it's monochromatic: \(2 \times 2^8 = 512\) (2 choices for the rectangle's color and \(2^8\) for the remaining vertices).
  
- **Calculations Using Inclusion-Exclusion:**
  \[
  |A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3| = |A_1| + |A_2| + |A_3| - |A_1 \cap A_2| - |A_1 \cap A_3| - |A_2 \cap A_3| + |A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3|
  \]
  \[
  = 3 \times 512 - 3 \times 64 + 8 = 1536 - 192 + 8 = 1352
  \]
  
- **Valid Colorings:**  
  Subtracting the invalid colorings from the total:
  \[
  4096 - 1352 = 2744
  \]
  
**Reflection:**  
Upon re-evaluating, I realize that this approach might have overlooked the intricate relationships between different rectangles. Specifically, the assumption that rectangles are independent might not hold, potentially leading to an overcounting or undercounting of invalid colorings.

### **Re-examining the Problem: Alternative Strategy**

**Brainstorming:**

- **Opposite Vertex Pairs:**  
  In a dodecagon, opposite vertices are six steps apart. There are **6 opposite pairs**:
  \[
  (V_0, V_6), (V_1, V_7), (V_2, V_8), (V_3, V_9), (V_4, V_{10}), (V_5, V_{11})
  \]
  
- **Rectangle Formation:**  
  A rectangle is formed when two distinct opposite pairs are monochromatic **and** share the same color. For example, if both \((V_0, V_6)\) and \((V_3, V_9)\) are red, they form a red rectangle.

**Key Insight:**  
To **avoid** forming a monochromatic rectangle, **no two distinct opposite pairs** should be monochromatic **in the same color**.

---

### **Detailed Casework Approach**

To ensure no four vertices of the same color form a rectangle, we'll perform casework based on the number of monochromatic opposite pairs.

**Total Opposite Pairs:** 6

Each pair can be colored in three ways:

1. **Both Red**
2. **Both Blue**
3. **One Red and One Blue**

However, to prevent forming a monochromatic rectangle, we must limit how many pairs are monochromatic **in the same color**.

#### **Case 1: No Pairs Are Monochromatic**

- **Description:**  
  All opposite pairs are colored with one red and one blue vertex.
  
- **Calculation:**  
  - For each of the 6 pairs, there are 2 choices: which vertex is red and which is blue.
  - Total ways: \(2^6 = 64\)

#### **Case 2: Exactly One Pair Is Monochromatic**

- **Description:**  
  Exactly one pair is colored both red or both blue, and the remaining five pairs are colored with one red and one blue.
  
- **Calculation:**  
  - **Step 1:** Choose which pair is monochromatic: \(\binom{6}{1} = 6\) ways.
  - **Step 2:** Choose the color for this monochromatic pair: 2 choices (red or blue).
  - **Step 3:** For the remaining 5 pairs, assign one red and one blue: \(2^5 = 32\) ways.
  - **Total for this case:** \(6 \times 2 \times 32 = 384\)

#### **Case 3: Exactly Two Pairs Are Monochromatic**

- **Description:**  
  Exactly two distinct pairs are monochromatic, but they must be of different colors to avoid forming a monochromatic rectangle.
  
- **Calculation:**  
  - **Step 1:** Choose two distinct pairs to be monochromatic: \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\) ways.
  - **Step 2:** Assign colors to these two pairs:
    - The first pair can be either red or blue: 2 choices.
    - The second pair must be the opposite color: 1 choice.
    - **Total color assignments:** \(2 \times 1 = 2\)
  - **Step 3:** For the remaining 4 pairs, assign one red and one blue: \(2^4 = 16\) ways.
  - **Total for this case:** \(15 \times 2 \times 16 = 480\)

#### **Case 4: Three or More Pairs Are Monochromatic**

- **Description:**  
  If three or more pairs are monochromatic, there will necessarily be at least two pairs of the same color, forming a monochromatic rectangle.
  
- **Conclusion:**  
  **Not allowed.** No valid colorings in this scenario.

---

### **Summing Up Valid Colorings**

Now, we'll sum the valid colorings from each case to find the total number of acceptable colorings.

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total Valid Colorings} &= \text{Case 1} + \text{Case 2} + \text{Case 3} \\
&= 64 + 384 + 480 \\
&= 928
\end{align*}
\]

**Final Answer:**  
There are **928** valid colorings where no four vertices of the same color form the vertices of a rectangle.

---

### **Identifying and Correcting the Initial Misstep**

**Where Did the Initial Approach Go Wrong?**

In my initial solution, I treated each rectangle as an independent entity when applying the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. This oversight led to an overestimation of invalid colorings because it didn't adequately account for the dependencies between different rectangles. Specifically, when multiple rectangles share color assignments, the overlapping constraints weren't fully considered, resulting in an inflated count of invalid scenarios.

**Why the Revised Approach Works Better:**

The revised casework approach focuses on **opposite vertex pairs**, ensuring that no two distinct pairs are monochromatic in the same color. This method inherently prevents the formation of monochromatic rectangles by design, leading to an accurate count without the complexities and potential overlaps inherent in the Inclusion-Exclusion method.

**Final Reflection:**

Through this thorough re-examination and alternative strategy exploration, we've arrived at a more accurate and logically consistent solution. It's a valuable reminder that multiple approaches can yield different insights, and cross-verifying with alternative methods is essential for ensuring correctness in combinatorial problems.
