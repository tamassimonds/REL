### Answer:
### Tackling the Sequence Problem: Finding the Smallest Possible 19th Term

Alright, let's dive into this intriguing sequence problem. We have a sequence of 100 integers with specific conditions, and our goal is to find the smallest possible value for the 19th term. Here's the problem statement again for clarity:

**Problem Statement:**
- We have a sequence of 100 integers: \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{100} \).
- The first and last terms are zero: \( a_1 = 0 \) and \( a_{100} = 0 \).
- For each term \( a_i \) where \( 2 \leq i \leq 99 \), it satisfies:
  \[
  a_i > \frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{2}
  \]
- **Goal:** Find the smallest possible value for \( a_{19} \).

### Initial Brainstorming

**First Thoughts:**
Okay, we're dealing with a sequence where each inner term is strictly greater than the average of its immediate neighbors. That condition feels like it's enforcing some sort of "convexity" in the sequence. Since both ends are zero, the sequence starts and ends at the same point, and the inner terms must peak above the surrounding averages.

I need to find the minimal value for the 19th term, which suggests that the sequence should be as "low" as possible around that term while still satisfying the given conditions.

**Possible Strategies:**
1. **Constructive Approach:** Build a sequence step by step, ensuring each term satisfies the condition, and try to minimize \( a_{19} \).
2. **Mathematical Inequalities:** Translate the condition into inequalities and see if we can find bounds for \( a_{19} \).
3. **Symmetry or Patterns:** Look for symmetric patterns or other regularities in the sequence that might help in minimizing \( a_{19} \).

Let's explore these strategies one by one.

### Exploring Strategy 1: Constructive Approach

**Attempting a Sample Sequence:**
Let's start simple. Suppose each term increases by 1:
\[
0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots
\]
But wait, does this satisfy the condition \( a_i > \frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{2} \)?

Let's check for \( i = 2 \):
\[
1 > \frac{0 + 2}{2} \implies 1 > 1
\]
That's not true. Oops, this sequence doesn't satisfy the condition. Time to rethink.

**Trying a Larger Increment:**
Maybe increasing by 2:
\[
0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots
\]
Check for \( i = 2 \):
\[
2 > \frac{0 + 4}{2} \implies 2 > 2
\]
Again, equality holds but not the strict inequality required. This doesn't work either.

**Reflection:**
Hmm, simply increasing by a constant difference isn't sufficient because it only meets the condition without exceeding it. We need a sequence where each term is *strictly greater* than the average of its neighbors.

**Adjusting the Approach:**
Perhaps the increments between terms need to vary to ensure the condition is satisfied. Let's try alternating differences.

**Sample Sequence with Alternating Differences:**
Let's try:
\[
0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5, \ldots
\]
Check for \( i = 2 \):
\[
1 > \frac{0 + 3}{2} \implies 1 > 1.5 \quad \text{(False)}
\]
Nope, that doesn't work. Need a different pattern.

**Reflection:**
This approach isn't yielding a valid sequence. Maybe the differences need to be increasing rather than alternating. Let's consider that.

### Exploring Strategy 2: Mathematical Inequalities

**Translating the Condition:**
The condition \( a_i > \frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{2} \) can be rewritten as:
\[
2a_i > a_{i-1} + a_{i+1} \implies a_{i+1} < 2a_i - a_{i-1}
\]
This suggests that each term is constrained based on its two predecessors.

**Establishing Recurrence Relation:**
This inequality resembles a recurrence relation. However, it's an inequality rather than an equality, which complicates things. To find the minimal \( a_{19} \), perhaps we need to maximize the terms before it to allow \( a_{19} \) to be as small as possible.

**Setting Up Equations:**
Let's consider setting up inequalities for terms up to \( a_{19} \). But with 100 terms, this quickly becomes unwieldy.

**Reflection:**
This approach might not be the most efficient given the sequence's length. Perhaps we can find a pattern or a specific property that can be generalized.

### Exploring Strategy 3: Symmetry and Patterns

**Looking for Patterns:**
Given that \( a_1 = a_{100} = 0 \), the sequence must start and end at zero. The condition \( a_i > \frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{2} \) suggests that the sequence has peaks where each inner term is above its neighbors' average.

**Considering Symmetry:**
If the sequence is symmetric around its midpoint (i.e., \( a_k = a_{101 - k} \) for all \( k \)), this might simplify the problem. However, symmetry isn't guaranteed by the problem statement.

**Reflection:**
Without more constraints, assuming symmetry might not be valid. Let's think differently.

### Combining Insights and Reassessing

**Rewriting the Condition:**
Recall that:
\[
a_{i+1} < 2a_i - a_{i-1}
\]
This indicates that each term is bounded by its predecessors. To minimize \( a_{19} \), we need to find the minimal growth up to that point.

**Dynamic Programming Approach:**
Perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem, where each term depends on the previous two. However, with 100 terms, this would be computationally intensive without a pattern.

**Reflection:**
This path seems too complex. Let's try a different angle.

### Another Perspective: Maximizing Previous Terms to Minimize \( a_{19} \)

**Idea:**
To minimize \( a_{19} \), we can try to maximize the values of the terms before it, within the given constraints. This would allow \( a_{19} \) to be as small as possible while still satisfying \( a_{19} > \frac{a_{18} + a_{20}}{2} \).

**Constructing the Sequence Backwards:**
Starting from \( a_{100} = 0 \), we can attempt to build the sequence backwards, ensuring each term satisfies the condition.

**Sample Construction:**
Let's attempt to construct the sequence from \( a_{100} \) backward to \( a_1 \), maximizing each term to allow \( a_{19} \) to be minimized.

However, this is quite abstract. Maybe an illustrative example would help.

**Reflection:**
This approach is still too vague. Perhaps an explicit construction or mathematical formulation is necessary.

### Final Strategy: Mathematical Optimization

**Formulating as an Optimization Problem:**
We need to find the minimal \( a_{19} \) such that:
\[
a_i > \frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{2} \quad \text{for all } 2 \leq i \leq 99
\]
with \( a_1 = a_{100} = 0 \).

**Expressing as Differences:**
Let’s define \( d_i = a_{i} - a_{i-1} \). Then, the condition becomes:
\[
a_i > \frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{2} \implies 2a_i > a_{i-1} + a_{i+1} \implies 2(a_{i-1} + d_i) > a_{i-1} + a_{i-1} + d_i + d_{i+1}} \implies d_i > d_{i+1}
\]
This implies that the differences \( d_i \) are strictly decreasing.

**Setting Up the Sequence:**
Given that \( d_i > d_{i+1} \), the sequence of differences must form a strictly decreasing sequence. To minimize \( a_{19} \), we should make the differences as large as possible early on, allowing for smaller differences later.

**Maximizing Early Differences:**
Let's set \( d_1 \) as large as possible. Since \( a_1 = 0 \) and \( a_{100} = 0 \), the sum of all differences must equal zero:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{99} d_i = a_{100} - a_1 = 0 - 0 = 0
\]
Given that \( d_i > d_{i+1} \) and their sum is zero, the differences must eventually become negative after a certain point.

**Reflection:**
This is a key insight! The differences start positive and decrease, eventually becoming negative to bring the sequence back to zero. Our goal is to arrange these differences to minimize \( a_{19} \).

### Implementing the Optimization

**Assuming Linearity:**
For simplicity, let's assume that the differences decrease by a constant amount. Let’s denote the common decrease as \( k \):
\[
d_i = d_1 - (i-1)k
\]
Since the sum of all differences must be zero:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{99} d_i = \sum_{i=1}^{99} [d_1 - (i-1)k] = 99d_1 - k \sum_{i=1}^{99} (i-1) = 99d_1 - k \cdot \frac{98 \cdot 99}{2} = 0
\]
Solving for \( d_1 \):
\[
99d_1 = k \cdot \frac{98 \cdot 99}{2} \implies d_1 = 49k
\]
**Expressing \( d_i \):**
\[
d_i = 49k - (i-1)k = k(49 - (i-1)) = k(50 - i)
\]
**Calculating \( a_{19} \):**
\[
a_{19} = \sum_{i=1}^{19} d_i = \sum_{i=1}^{19} k(50 - i) = k \sum_{i=1}^{19} (50 - i) = k \cdot \sum_{j=31}^{49} j = k \cdot \left( \frac{(31 + 49) \cdot 19}{2} \right) = k \cdot 760
\]
**Minimizing \( a_{19} \):**
To minimize \( a_{19} \), we need to choose the smallest possible integer \( k \) that satisfies the condition \( d_i > d_{i+1} \).

Since \( d_i = k(50 - i) \) must be positive for \( i \leq 49 \) and negative for \( i \geq 51 \), the smallest integer \( k \) we can choose is \( k = 1 \).

**Final Calculation:**
\[
a_{19} = 1 \cdot 760 = 760
\]

### Reflection and Verification

**Double-Checking the Sequence:**
Given \( k = 1 \), the differences are:
\[
d_i = 50 - i
\]
So,
\[
a_2 = a_1 + d_1 = 0 + 49 = 49
\]
\[
a_3 = a_2 + d_2 = 49 + 48 = 97
\]
\[
\vdots
\]
\[
a_{19} = 760
\]
And eventually, the sequence decreases back to zero at \( a_{100} \).

**Ensuring the Condition is Met:**
For each \( i \), \( a_i > \frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{2} \). Given our construction, this condition holds because each \( d_i \) is strictly greater than \( d_{i+1} \), ensuring the convexity required by the problem.

**Final Answer:**
The smallest possible value for the 19th term \( a_{19} \) is **760**.

### Conclusion

Through a combination of constructing sample sequences, translating conditions into mathematical inequalities, and optimizing based on the sequence's properties, we've determined that the smallest possible value for the 19th term is 760. This process involved exploring different strategies, encountering and reflecting on dead ends, and ultimately finding a coherent mathematical approach to solve the problem.
