### Question:

Two different points, $C$ and $D$, lie on the same side of line $AB$ so that $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle BAD$ are congruent with $AB=9,BC=AD=10$, and $CA=DB=17$. The intersection of these two triangular regions has area $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.



### Answer:
Alright, let's dive into this problem together. I'll walk you through my thought process step by step, exploring different strategies, checking their validity, and adjusting as needed. Let's begin by understanding what's given and what we need to find.

**Problem Statement Recap:**

We have two congruent triangles, \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle BAD \), placed on the same side of line \( AB \). The side lengths are given as:
- \( AB = 9 \)
- \( BC = AD = 10 \)
- \( CA = DB = 17 \)

Our goal is to find the area of the intersection of these two triangular regions, expressed as \( \frac{m}{n} \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime positive integers, and then determine \( m + n \).

**First Thoughts:**

When dealing with congruent triangles and their positions relative to a common base (in this case, \( AB \)), it's often helpful to assign coordinates to the points to simplify calculations. However, before jumping into coordinate geometry, let's see if there's a more geometric or algebraic approach.

Given that \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle BAD \) are congruent, and they share the side \( AB \), it suggests that one triangle is a reflection or rotation of the other about \( AB \). This symmetry might be useful in determining the positions of points \( C \) and \( D \).

**Strategy Exploration:**

1. **Coordinate Geometry Approach:**
   - Assign coordinates to points \( A \) and \( B \).
   - Use the given side lengths to find coordinates of \( C \) and \( D \).
   - Determine the equations of relevant lines or regions.
   - Find the intersection area of the two triangles.

2. **Geometric Properties and Symmetry:**
   - Analyze the congruency and positioning to deduce relationships.
   - Use geometric theorems to find necessary lengths or angles.
   - Calculate the area based on overlapping regions.

Let's start with the **Coordinate Geometry Approach**, as it provides a systematic way to handle the problem.

**Assigning Coordinates:**

- Let's place point \( A \) at the origin, \( (0, 0) \).
- Place point \( B \) along the x-axis at \( (9, 0) \), since \( AB = 9 \).

Now, we need to determine the coordinates of points \( C \) and \( D \).

**Finding Coordinates of Point \( C \):**

Given:
- \( AC = 17 \)
- \( BC = 10 \)

We can set up equations based on the distance formula.

Let \( C = (x, y) \).

From \( AC = 17 \):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 17 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 + y^2 = 289 \quad (1)
\]

From \( BC = 10 \):
\[
\sqrt{(x - 9)^2 + y^2} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (x - 9)^2 + y^2 = 100 \quad (2)
\]

**Solving Equations (1) and (2):**

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
\[
x^2 + y^2 - [(x - 9)^2 + y^2] = 289 - 100
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - (x^2 - 18x + 81 + y^2) = 189
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - x^2 + 18x - 81 - y^2 = 189
\]
\[
18x - 81 = 189
\]
\[
18x = 270 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 15
\]

Now, substitute \( x = 15 \) into equation (1):
\[
15^2 + y^2 = 289
\]
\[
225 + y^2 = 289
\]
\[
y^2 = 64 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 8 \quad (\text{since \( C \) is on the same side as \( D \)})
\]

So, \( C = (15, 8) \).

**Finding Coordinates of Point \( D \):**

Given:
- \( AD = 10 \)
- \( DB = 17 \)

Let \( D = (x, y) \).

From \( AD = 10 \):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 + y^2 = 100 \quad (3)
\]

From \( DB = 17 \):
\[
\sqrt{(x - 9)^2 + y^2} = 17 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (x - 9)^2 + y^2 = 289 \quad (4)
\]

**Solving Equations (3) and (4):**

Subtract equation (3) from equation (4):
\[
(x - 9)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 289 - 100
\]
\[
x^2 - 18x + 81 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 189
\]
\[
-18x + 81 = 189
\]
\[
-18x = 108 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -6
\]

Now, substitute \( x = -6 \) into equation (3):
\[
(-6)^2 + y^2 = 100
\]
\[
36 + y^2 = 100
\]
\[
y^2 = 64 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 8 \quad (\text{since \( D \) is on the same side as \( C \)})
\]

So, \( D = (-6, 8) \).

**Reflecting on the Coordinates:**

We have:
- \( A = (0, 0) \)
- \( B = (9, 0) \)
- \( C = (15, 8) \)
- \( D = (-6, 8) \)

It makes sense geometrically: both \( C \) and \( D \) are 8 units above the x-axis (same side of \( AB \)), and their x-coordinates are symmetrically placed around point \( B \).

**Determining the Intersection of the Triangles:**

The two triangles \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle BAD \) overlap in a certain region. To find the area of this intersection, we need to identify the common area shared by both triangles.

**Visualizing the Triangles:**

- \( \triangle ABC \) has vertices at \( A(0,0) \), \( B(9,0) \), and \( C(15,8) \).
- \( \triangle BAD \) has vertices at \( B(9,0) \), \( A(0,0) \), and \( D(-6,8) \).

Both triangles share the base \( AB \). Point \( C \) is to the right of \( B \), and point \( D \) is to the left of \( A \), both at the same height \( y = 8 \).

**Finding the Intersection Point:**

The overlapping region will be a quadrilateral bounded by parts of the two triangles. However, given the symmetry, it's likely that the intersection forms a triangle.

To find the exact intersection, let's find the equations of the lines forming the sides of the triangles and determine their intersection points.

1. **Equation of \( AC \):**
   - Points \( A(0,0) \) and \( C(15,8) \).
   - Slope \( m_{AC} = \frac{8 - 0}{15 - 0} = \frac{8}{15} \).
   - Equation: \( y = \frac{8}{15}x \).

2. **Equation of \( BD \):**
   - Points \( B(9,0) \) and \( D(-6,8) \).
   - Slope \( m_{BD} = \frac{8 - 0}{-6 - 9} = \frac{8}{-15} = -\frac{8}{15} \).
   - Using point-slope form: \( y - 0 = -\frac{8}{15}(x - 9) \).
   - Simplifies to: \( y = -\frac{8}{15}x + \frac{72}{15} = -\frac{8}{15}x + \frac{24}{5} \).

**Finding the Intersection Point \( P \) of \( AC \) and \( BD \):**

Set the equations equal to each other:
\[
\frac{8}{15}x = -\frac{8}{15}x + \frac{24}{5}
\]
\[
\frac{16}{15}x = \frac{24}{5}
\]
\[
x = \frac{24}{5} \times \frac{15}{16} = \frac{24 \times 15}{5 \times 16} = \frac{360}{80} = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
\]

Now, find \( y \):
\[
y = \frac{8}{15} \times 4.5 = \frac{8}{15} \times \frac{9}{2} = \frac{72}{30} = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4
\]

So, the intersection point \( P \) is at \( \left( \frac{9}{2}, \frac{12}{5} \right) \).

**Visualizing the Intersection:**

The intersection of the two triangles is a smaller triangle formed by:
- Point \( A(0,0) \)
- Point \( B(9,0) \)
- Point \( P\left( \frac{9}{2}, \frac{12}{5} \right) \)

**Calculating the Area of the Intersection Triangle \( \triangle ABP \):**

We can use the shoelace formula to find the area of a triangle given its vertices.

Given points \( (x_1, y_1) \), \( (x_2, y_2) \), and \( (x_3, y_3) \), the area is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|
\]

Plugging in our points:
\[
A = (0, 0), \quad B = (9, 0), \quad P = \left( \frac{9}{2}, \frac{12}{5} \right)
\]

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(0 - \frac{12}{5}) + 9\left( \frac{12}{5} - 0 \right) + \frac{9}{2}(0 - 0) \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + \frac{108}{5} + 0 \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{108}{5} = \frac{54}{5}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The area of the intersection is \( \frac{54}{5} \). Therefore, \( m = 54 \) and \( n = 5 \), which are coprime.

\[
m + n = 54 + 5 = \boxed{59}
\]
