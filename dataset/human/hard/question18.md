### Question:
For any finite set $X$, let $| X |$ denote the number of elements in $X$. Define\[S_n = \sum | A \cap B | ,\]where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\left\{ 1 , 2 , 3,  \cdots , n \right\}$ with $|A| = |B|$. For example, $S_2 = 4$ because the sum is taken over the pairs of subsets\[(A, B) \in \left\{ (\emptyset, \emptyset) , ( \{1\} , \{1\} ), ( \{1\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{1\} ) , ( \{2\} , \{2\} ) , ( \{1 , 2\} , \{1 , 2\} ) \right\} ,\]giving $S_2 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4$. Let $\frac{S_{2022}}{S_{2021}} = \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $p + q$ is divided by 1000.
### Answer:
Problem Statement
For any finite set 
𝑋
X, let 
∣
𝑋
∣
∣X∣ denote the number of elements in 
𝑋
X. Define:

𝑆
𝑛
=
∑
∣
𝐴
∩
𝐵
∣
,
S 
n
​
 =∑∣A∩B∣,
where the sum is taken over all ordered pairs 
(
𝐴
,
𝐵
)
(A,B) such that 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B are subsets of 
{
1
,
2
,
3
,
…
,
𝑛
}
{1,2,3,…,n} with 
∣
𝐴
∣
=
∣
𝐵
∣
∣A∣=∣B∣.

Given: 
𝑆
2
=
4
S 
2
​
 =4 (as detailed in the problem).

Goal: Let 
𝑆
2022
𝑆
2021
=
𝑝
𝑞
S 
2021
​
 
S 
2022
​
 
​
 = 
q
p
​
 , where 
𝑝
p and 
𝑞
q are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when 
𝑝
+
𝑞
p+q is divided by 
1000
1000.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem
We need to compute 
𝑆
𝑛
S 
n
​
  for general 
𝑛
n, then determine the ratio 
𝑆
2022
𝑆
2021
S 
2021
​
 
S 
2022
​
 
​
 , simplify it to its lowest terms 
𝑝
𝑞
q
p
​
 , and finally compute 
(
𝑝
+
𝑞
)
m
o
d
 
 
1000
(p+q)mod1000.

Given the complexity of directly computing 
𝑆
𝑛
S 
n
​
  for large 
𝑛
n (like 2022), it's prudent to look for a pattern or a general formula for 
𝑆
𝑛
S 
n
​
  that can be applied recursively or derived combinatorially.

Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies
Direct Enumeration:

For small 
𝑛
n, like 
𝑛
=
2
n=2, we can list all subsets 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B of 
{
1
,
2
}
{1,2} with equal sizes and compute 
∣
𝐴
∩
𝐵
∣
∣A∩B∣.
However, for large 
𝑛
n, direct enumeration becomes infeasible.
Combinatorial Approach:

Instead of listing all pairs, find a combinatorial expression that calculates 
𝑆
𝑛
S 
n
​
  based on known combinatorial identities.
Recursive Relationship:

Determine if there's a recursive relationship between 
𝑆
𝑛
S 
n
​
  and 
𝑆
𝑛
−
1
S 
n−1
​
  that can simplify calculations.
Symmetry and Linearity:

Utilize the linearity of expectation or symmetry properties in combinatorics to simplify the sum.
After considering these strategies, the Combinatorial Approach seems promising for deriving a general formula.

Step 3: Applying the Combinatorial Approach
Objective: Find a general expression for 
𝑆
𝑛
S 
n
​
 .

Consider all ordered pairs 
(
𝐴
,
𝐵
)
(A,B) where 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B are subsets of 
{
1
,
2
,
…
,
𝑛
}
{1,2,…,n} with 
∣
𝐴
∣
=
∣
𝐵
∣
=
𝑘
∣A∣=∣B∣=k for some 
𝑘
k.

 .

Contribution to 
𝑆
𝑛
S 
n
​
  from Each Pair: 
∣
𝐴
∩
𝐵
∣
∣A∩B∣.

To compute 
𝑆
𝑛
S 
n
​
 , sum 
∣
𝐴
∩
𝐵
∣
∣A∩B∣ over all such pairs for each 
𝑘
k.

Step 4: Simplifying the Sum Using Indicator Variables
Introduce an indicator variable approach to simplify the sum:

Indicator Variable for Element Inclusion:

For each element 
𝑖
i in 
{
1
,
2
,
…
,
𝑛
}
{1,2,…,n}, define:
𝐼
𝑖
=
{
1
if 
𝑖
∈
𝐴
∩
𝐵
,
0
otherwise
.
I 
i
​
 ={ 
1
0
​
  
if i∈A∩B,
otherwise.
​
 
Expressing

Interpretation: For each element 
𝑖
i, count the number of ordered pairs 
(
𝐴
,
𝐵
)
(A,B) where 
𝑖
i is present in both 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.

Step 5: Calculating the Inner Sum for Each Element 
𝑖
i
Fix an element 
𝑖
i. We need to count the number of ordered pairs 
(
𝐴
,
𝐵
)
(A,B) where:

𝑖
∈
𝐴
∩
𝐵
i∈A∩B.
∣
𝐴
∣
=

=

∣A∣=∣B∣=k for some 
𝑘
k.
Choosing 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B:

Include 
𝑖
i in Both 
𝐴

This reduces the problem to selecting the remaining

∑

Thus, for each element

i, the number of ordered pairs 
(

)
(A,B) with 
∣

∣
=

∑

Notice that

Reflection
Throughout this problem, we employed a systematic combinatorial approach:

Decomposition of the Problem:
We began by understanding what 
𝑆
𝑛
S 
n
​
  represents and sought a general formula.
Indicator Variables:
By introducing indicator variables for each element's inclusion in 
𝐴
∩
𝐵
A∩B, we transformed the problem into counting specific ordered pairs.
Combinatorial Identity:
Recognizing the sum 
∑
(
𝑛
−
1
𝑘
−
1
)
2
∑( 
k−1
n−1
​
 ) 
2
  as a known combinatorial identity allowed us to express 
𝑆
𝑛
S 
n
​
  succinctly.
Recursive Relationship:
Establishing the ratio 
𝑆

​
 
​
  and simplifying it using factorial properties was crucial in handling large values like 
𝑛
=
2022
n=2022.
Factorization and Simplification:
Factoring both numerator and denominator helped in simplifying the ratio to its lowest terms, ensuring 
𝑝
p and 
𝑞
q were coprime.
Modular Arithmetic:
Finally, calculating

1000
(p+q)mod1000 was straightforward once
