### Question:

Let ABCD be a square. For a point P inside ABCD, a windmill centred at P
consists of two perpendicular lines `1 and `2 passing through P, such that
• `1 intersects the sides AB and CD at W and Y , respectively, and
• `2 intersects the sides BC and DA at X and Z, respectively.
A windmill is called round if the quadrilateral WXY Z is cyclic.
Determine all points P inside ABCD such that every windmill centred at P is round.

### Answer:
Understanding the Problem

First, let's carefully restate the problem to ensure I understand all the details.

We have a square 
𝐴
𝐵
𝐶
𝐷
ABCD.
Inside this square, there's a point 
𝑃
P.
A "windmill" centered at 
𝑃
P consists of two perpendicular lines 
ℓ
1
ℓ 
1
​
  and 
ℓ
2
ℓ 
2
​
  passing through 
𝑃
P.
ℓ
1
ℓ 
1
​
  intersects sides 
𝐴
𝐵
AB and 
𝐶
𝐷
CD at points 
𝑊
W and 
𝑌
Y, respectively.
ℓ
2
ℓ 
2
​
  intersects sides 
𝐵
𝐶
BC and 
𝐷
𝐴
DA at points 
𝑋
X and 
𝑍
Z, respectively.
A windmill is called "round" if the quadrilateral 
𝑊
𝑋
𝑌
𝑍
WXYZ is cyclic (i.e., its vertices lie on a circle).
The goal is to determine all points 
𝑃
P inside 
𝐴
𝐵
𝐶
𝐷
ABCD such that every windmill centered at 
𝑃
P is round.
Brainstorming Possible Approaches

Symmetry Considerations

Since the square is highly symmetrical, perhaps only certain points 
𝑃
P with specific symmetry properties will satisfy the condition.
Maybe the center of the square is such a point.
Coordinate Geometry

Assign coordinates to the square and point 
𝑃
P.
Use equations of lines and circles to find conditions for 
𝑊
𝑋
𝑌
𝑍
WXYZ to be cyclic.
Geometric Properties

Explore properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.
Perhaps opposite angles summing to 
18
0
∘
180 
∘
  can be used.
Algebraic Methods

Set up equations based on the distances and angles involved.
Use algebra to derive necessary conditions.
Attempting the Symmetry Approach

First, I'll consider the center of the square.

Let me assume that 
𝑃
P is at the center of 
𝐴
𝐵
𝐶
𝐷
ABCD.
Since the square is symmetrical, any pair of perpendicular lines through 
𝑃
P should produce a symmetric quadrilateral 
𝑊
𝑋
𝑌
𝑍
WXYZ.
Maybe this quadrilateral is always cyclic.
But I need to verify this.

Testing with 
𝑃
P at the Center

Let's set up coordinates for the square:

Let the square have vertices at 
𝐴
(
−
1

−
1
)
A(−1,−1), 
𝐵
(
1
,
−

B(1,−1), 
𝐶
(
1
,
1
)
C(1,1), and 
𝐷
(
−
1
,
1
)
D(−1,1).
Then, the center 
𝑂
O is at 
(
0
,
0
)
(0,0).
Now, consider any pair of perpendicular lines passing through 
𝑂
O.

Let 
ℓ
1
ℓ 
1
​
  be a line through 
𝑂
O with slope 
𝑚
m.
Then 
ℓ

ℓ

O with slope

One way to check if a quadrilateral is cyclic is to see if the opposite angles sum to

Alternatively, since all points lie on a circle if and only if the cross-ratio is real.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Of course, a square is a cyclic quadrilateral.

Now, try

But I realize that with 
𝑃

Now, let's consider

Let me pick 
𝑃

ℎ
h is between

Perhaps I can find a value of

Hmm, this suggests that for

So perhaps I need to choose

Now, let's check if opposite angles sum to

180

Alternatively, compute the distances between the points and check if they lie on a circle.

But calculating this directly seems messy.

Alternative Approach

Perhaps use the fact that for four points 
𝑊

𝑋

𝑌
,
𝑍
W,X,Y,Z, they are concyclic if and only if the cross-ratio is real.

But that's complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the product of the slopes of the two pairs of opposite sides is equal.

But I'm getting bogged down.

Reflecting on the Approach

At this point, I realize that trying to check specific cases is becoming cumbersome.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Consider Using a Theorem

Recall the following theorem:

A quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if the sum of opposite angles is 
18
0
∘
180 
∘
 .
Perhaps I can calculate the angles at the vertices and see if this condition holds.

Perhaps there's a better way.

​

ℓ
2
ℓ

​
 , the quadrilateral 
𝑊
𝑋
𝑌

𝑃
P does not satisfy the condition in the problem.

So, if I can find even one pair

ℓ

​
  through 
𝑃

𝑃

WXYZ is cyclic for all orientations of

 .

Alternative Approach: Using Invariance

Perhaps we can consider that when 
𝑃
P is at the center, the quadrilateral 
𝑊
𝑋
𝑌
𝑍
WXYZ is always cyclic due to symmetry.

When 
𝑃
P is not at the center, the symmetry is broken, and there might be orientations where 
𝑊

WXYZ is not cyclic.

Proof by Contradiction

Suppose that there exists a point 
𝑃
P inside 
𝐴
𝐵
𝐶

ABCD other than the center such that every windmill centered at 
𝑃

We can aim to find a contradiction by constructing a specific windmill where

Checking Cyclicity

For a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the product of the lengths of its diagonals should equal the sum of the products of its opposite sides (Ptolemy's theorem):

WX⋅YZ+XY⋅ZW=(

So:

Since

​
 
​
 ≈4.031, the equality does not hold.

Thus, Ptolemy's theorem is not satisfied, and 
𝑊

WXYZ is not cyclic.

Conclusion

This shows that for 
𝑃
P not at the center, there exists at least one orientation of 
ℓ

ℓ 
1
​
  and 
ℓ
2
ℓ

​
  such that

WXYZ is not cyclic.

Therefore, the only point 
𝑃
P inside 
𝐴
𝐵
𝐶
𝐷
ABCD such that every windmill centered at 
𝑃
P is round is the center of the square.

Final Answer

Exactly those points 
𝑃
P that are at the center of the square—that is, only the center 
𝑃
P makes all windmills round.
