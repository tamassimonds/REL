### Answer:
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, checking along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed.

**Problem Statement:**

Find the number of 7-tuples of positive integers \((a, b, c, d, e, f, g)\) that satisfy the following systems of equations:

\[
\begin{align*}
abc &= 70, \\
cde &= 71, \\
efg &= 72.
\end{align*}
\]

**First Thoughts:**

Okay, we have three equations involving the products of three variables each. We're dealing with positive integers, which suggests that prime factorization might be useful here. The numbers 70, 71, and 72 stand out:

- 70 factors into \(2 \times 5 \times 7\).
- 71 is a prime number.
- 72 factors into \(2^3 \times 3^2\).

Given that 71 is prime, it might limit the possibilities for \(c, d,\) and \(e\). Maybe starting with the second equation could simplify things.

**Exploring Strategy 1: Start with \(cde = 71\)**

Since 71 is prime, the only way to express it as a product of three positive integers is by having two of them as 1 and the third as 71. So, the possible combinations for \((c, d, e)\) are:

1. \(c = 1\), \(d = 1\), \(e = 71\)
2. \(c = 1\), \(d = 71\), \(e = 1\)
3. \(c = 71\), \(d = 1\), \(e = 1\)

**Case 1: \(c = 1\), \(d = 1\), \(e = 71\)**

Let's plug these into the other equations.

- From \(abc = 70\), with \(c = 1\), we have \(ab = 70\).
- From \(efg = 72\), with \(e = 71\), we get \(71 \times f \times g = 72\), which simplifies to \(f \times g = \frac{72}{71}\).

Wait a minute, \(f \times g\) has to be an integer since \(f\) and \(g\) are positive integers. But \(\frac{72}{71}\) isn't an integer. That means this case doesn't yield any valid solutions. Hmm, that's a dead end.

**Case 2: \(c = 1\), \(d = 71\), \(e = 1\)**

Let's try this combination.

- From \(abc = 70\), with \(c = 1\), we have \(ab = 70\).
- From \(efg = 72\), with \(e = 1\), we get \(1 \times f \times g = 72\), so \(f \times g = 72\).

This looks promising. Both \(ab = 70\) and \(fg = 72\) are equations we can work with, given the factorizations of 70 and 72.

**Case 3: \(c = 71\), \(d = 1\), \(e = 1\)**

Before I dive into solving this case, let's quickly check if it's feasible.

- From \(abc = 70\), with \(c = 71\), we get \(ab = \frac{70}{71}\).

Again, \(\frac{70}{71}\) isn't an integer, so this case also doesn't work. Another dead end.

**Reviewing Cases:**

So, out of the three possible cases for \((c, d, e)\), only Case 2 yields a feasible path forward. That narrows things down nicely.

**Proceeding with Case 2: \(c = 1\), \(d = 71\), \(e = 1\)**

Now, let's find all possible positive integer pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(ab = 70\), and all positive integer pairs \((f, g)\) such that \(fg = 72\).

**Finding Solutions for \(ab = 70\):**

First, let's list all the factor pairs of 70:

1. \(a = 1\), \(b = 70\)
2. \(a = 2\), \(b = 35\)
3. \(a = 5\), \(b = 14\)
4. \(a = 7\), \(b = 10\)

Since the order of \(a\) and \(b\) matters (they're distinct positions in the tuple), we also consider the reverse pairs:

5. \(a = 70\), \(b = 1\)
6. \(a = 35\), \(b = 2\)
7. \(a = 14\), \(b = 5\)
8. \(a = 10\), \(b = 7\)

So, there are 8 possible \((a, b)\) pairs.

**Finding Solutions for \(fg = 72\):**

Next, let's list all the factor pairs of 72:

1. \(f = 1\), \(g = 72\)
2. \(f = 2\), \(g = 36\)
3. \(f = 3\), \(g = 24\)
4. \(f = 4\), \(g = 18\)
5. \(f = 6\), \(g = 12\)
6. \(f = 8\), \(g = 9\)

Again, considering the reverse pairs:

7. \(f = 72\), \(g = 1\)
8. \(f = 36\), \(g = 2\)
9. \(f = 24\), \(g = 3\)
10. \(f = 18\), \(g = 4\)
11. \(f = 12\), \(g = 6\)
12. \(f = 9\), \(g = 8\)

So, there are 12 possible \((f, g)\) pairs.

**Calculating Total Number of Solutions:**

Since \(a\) and \(b\) can independently take any of the 8 pairs, and \(f\) and \(g\) can independently take any of the 12 pairs, the total number of valid 7-tuples is:

\[
\text{Total solutions} = 8 \times 12 = 96
\]

**Double-Checking the Approach:**

Let's reflect to ensure this makes sense.

- We considered all possible cases based on the prime nature of 71.
- Only one case was feasible, leading to combinations for \(ab\) and \(fg\).
- We accounted for the order of factors since \(a\) and \(b\) (as well as \(f\) and \(g\)) are distinct positions in the tuple.

Everything seems to align correctly. There are no overlaps or missed cases based on our initial analysis.

**Conclusion:**

After carefully exploring the possible cases and ensuring all factor combinations are accounted for, we conclude that there are **96** positive integer 7-tuples \((a, b, c, d, e, f, g)\) that satisfy the given system of equations.

\(\boxed{96}\)
