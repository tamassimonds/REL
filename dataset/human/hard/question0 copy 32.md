### Question:
Lilypads $1,2,3,\ldots$ lie in a row on a pond. A frog makes a sequence of jumps starting on pad $1$. From any pad $k$ the frog jumps to either pad $k+1$ or pad $k+2$ chosen randomly with probability $\tfrac{1}{2}$ and independently of other jumps. The probability that the frog visits pad $7$ is $\tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

### Answer:
Alright, let's take a much more reflective approach to this problem, including brainstorming a variety of potential methods, exploring why some might work (or not work), and deciding on the best course of action as we progress.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

The problem asks about the probability of a frog reaching pad 7, starting from pad 1, where the frog can jump either 1 or 2 pads forward. This immediately suggests we’re dealing with a random process, likely a Markov chain. The idea is to figure out the chances of the frog eventually landing on pad 7, considering the constraints of how it can move.

**Initial Thoughts:**
- The frog starts on pad 1, and we want to know the probability that it will reach pad 7. This gives a sense of a stochastic process (like a random walk).
- The fact that the frog can either jump 1 or 2 steps makes this a Markov process, meaning its next move depends only on its current position, not its previous history.

### Step 2: Brainstorming Solutions

Let me think through different methods that might help solve this:

#### 1. **Recursive/Backtracking Approach (Markov Chain)**
- This looks like the most straightforward way to approach this. We could define \( P_i \) as the probability that the frog reaches pad 7 starting from pad \( i \), and recursively compute each \( P_i \).
- We’d start with base cases: \( P_7 = 1 \) (since the frog is already on pad 7) and \( P_i = 0 \) for \( i > 7 \) (because the frog can't jump beyond pad 7).
- Then, for \( i < 7 \), we calculate the probability of getting from pad \( i \) to pad 7 by considering the two possible jumps: one step forward or two steps forward.

**Why this might work:**
- This recursive strategy is often a solid approach for problems that involve sequential choices with clear outcomes, and it feels natural to work backwards from the destination.
- The problem breaks down into manageable subproblems where each state’s probability depends on the next possible states.

**Possible Issues:**
- While this recursive approach seems intuitive, I wonder if there’s a more efficient method that avoids recalculating the same probabilities repeatedly. It might also take longer as the number of pads increases.

#### 2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**
- Another way to solve this would be to use dynamic programming (DP). This would involve creating an array where each element represents the probability of reaching pad 7 from a particular pad.
- We can still use the recursive idea from above, but by storing the values once computed, we avoid redundant calculations.

**Why this might work:**
- DP could potentially speed up the calculation by reusing previously computed values. It's similar to recursion, but with a more systematic, iterative approach that stores intermediate results.

**Possible Issues:**
- It’s not fundamentally different from the recursive approach, so it may not offer significant improvements for this relatively small-scale problem. Still, it could be an optimization if the number of pads were much larger.

#### 3. **Markov Decision Process or Transition Matrix**
- We could also think of this problem in terms of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This would involve constructing a transition matrix that defines the probabilities of moving from one pad to another, and then solving for the stationary distribution.
- This approach would model the problem more formally, capturing the state transitions explicitly and providing a probabilistic framework for analysis.

**Why this might work:**
- This would provide a more formal and possibly elegant mathematical framework to solve the problem. It's the typical way of modeling problems in reinforcement learning or decision-making under uncertainty.

**Possible Issues:**
- This approach seems like overkill for this problem. The problem's simplicity (the frog can only move 1 or 2 steps at a time) doesn’t necessitate such a complex framework. It also seems like it could be more work than necessary for the solution we're after.

#### 4. **Binomial or Probability Tree Approach**
- Another method might involve constructing a binomial probability tree where each branch represents a jump (either 1 or 2 steps forward). From this tree, we could compute the probability of reaching pad 7 based on the different paths the frog could take.
  
**Why this might work:**
- This method would allow us to visualize the process clearly, and it might give us an intuitive sense of the probabilities involved by calculating the different possible paths.

**Possible Issues:**
- For a small problem like this (only 7 pads), the probability tree might not be too large, but as the number of pads increases, the tree would grow exponentially. This method seems more suited to visualizing the process rather than providing an efficient calculation.

---

### Step 3: Choosing a Strategy

Based on my reflections on the different methods, the **recursive/backtracking approach** seems the most straightforward and manageable. Since the number of pads is small (7), the recursive approach will be efficient enough. Additionally, it's a simple method that matches the structure of the problem, and I’m comfortable using it.

That said, I’ll keep in mind the potential for optimization with **dynamic programming** if I notice inefficiencies.

---

### Step 4: Start Solving Using the Recursive Approach

We define the probabilities for each pad. Starting from the base case:
- \( P_7 = 1 \), because once we are on pad 7, the probability of being on pad 7 is 100%.
- \( P_i = 0 \) for \( i > 7 \), because the frog can’t jump past pad 7.

Now, let’s calculate the probabilities for the pads leading up to pad 7. The recursive formula is:
\[
P_i = \frac{1}{2} P_{i+1} + \frac{1}{2} P_{i+2}
\]

- **Pad 6:** \( P_6 = \frac{1}{2} P_7 + \frac{1}{2} P_8 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 + \frac{1}{2} \times 0 = \frac{1}{2} \)
- **Pad 5:** \( P_5 = \frac{1}{2} P_6 + \frac{1}{2} P_7 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4} \)
- **Pad 4:** \( P_4 = \frac{1}{2} P_6 + \frac{1}{2} P_5 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{8} = \frac{5}{8} \)
- **Pad 3:** \( P_3 = \frac{1}{2} P_4 + \frac{1}{2} P_5 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{5}{8} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{5}{16} + \frac{6}{16} = \frac{11}{16} \)
- **Pad 2:** \( P_2 = \frac{1}{2} P_3 + \frac{1}{2} P_4 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{11}{16} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{5}{8} = \frac{11}{32} + \frac{10}{32} = \frac{21}{32} \)
- **Pad 1:** \( P_1 = \frac{1}{2} P_2 + \frac{1}{2} P_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{21}{32} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{11}{16} = \frac{21}{64} + \frac{22}{64} = \frac{43}{64} \)

---

### Step 5: Double-Check the Solution

I’ve arrived at the final result: \( P_1 = \frac{43}{64} \). But let me reflect for a moment:

- The calculations for each step seem consistent. I’ve followed the recursive relation correctly, and everything checks out as expected.
- The approach of calculating backwards from pad 7 makes sense for this kind of problem where the goal is to reach a specific target state.
  
Let me quickly double-check:
- \( P_6 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 + \frac{1}{2} \times 0 = \frac{1}{2} \), check.
- \( P_5 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = \frac{3}{4} \), check.
- \( P_4 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{5}{8} \), check.
- \( P_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{5}{8} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{11}{16} \), check

.
- \( P_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{11}{16} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{5}{8} = \frac{21}{32} \), check.
- \( P_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{21}{32} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{11}{16} = \frac{43}{64} \), check.

Everything seems to be correct, and the method used is clear and logical. The probability that the frog reaches pad 7 starting from pad 1 is indeed:

\[
\boxed{\frac{43}{64}}
\]
