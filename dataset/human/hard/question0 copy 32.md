### Question:
Lilypads $1,2,3,\ldots$ lie in a row on a pond. A frog makes a sequence of jumps starting on pad $1$. From any pad $k$ the frog jumps to either pad $k+1$ or pad $k+2$ chosen randomly with probability $\tfrac{1}{2}$ and independently of other jumps. The probability that the frog visits pad $7$ is $\tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

### Answer:
Certainly! Let's approach this problem thoughtfully, exploring various strategies, reflecting on each step, and ensuring our reasoning is sound throughout the process.

---

### **Understanding the Problem**

**First Thoughts:**
- *"We have a sequence of lily pads numbered 1 through 7, and a frog starts on pad 1. The frog can jump either 1 or 2 pads forward with equal probability. We need to find the probability that the frog eventually lands on pad 7."*
- *"This feels like a probability problem involving sequences of events. Maybe recursion or dynamic programming could help."*

---

### **Brainstorming Solutions**

**Exploring Different Strategies:**

1. **Recursive Approach (Markov Chain):**
   - *"Letâ€™s define \( P_k \) as the probability of reaching pad 7 starting from pad \( k \). Since from any pad \( k \), the frog can jump to \( k+1 \) or \( k+2 \) with equal probability, we can set up a recursive relationship."*
   
2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - *"Building upon the recursive idea, perhaps we can use dynamic programming to store intermediate probabilities to avoid redundant calculations."*
   
3. **Probability Tree:**
   - *"Visualizing all possible paths the frog can take to reach pad 7 might help, although this could become complex as the number of pads increases."*
   
4. **Direct Calculation Using Combinations:**
   - *"Maybe we can calculate the number of ways the frog can reach pad 7 using combinations of 1 and 2 jumps and then determine the probability based on total possible paths."*

**Reflection:**
- *"The recursive approach seems the most straightforward and manageable for this problem. Dynamic programming can optimize it, but since the number of pads is small, recursion alone should suffice."*

### **Choosing a Strategy**

Based on the brainstorming, the **recursive approach** appears to be the most efficient and intuitive for this problem. It aligns well with the nature of the frog's jumps and the sequential dependency of each pad's probability.

---

### **Solving the Problem Using the Recursive Approach**

**Step 1: Define the Probabilities**

- Let \( P_k \) represent the probability of the frog reaching pad 7 starting from pad \( k \).
- **Base Cases:**
  - \( P_7 = 1 \) (If the frog is already on pad 7, it has successfully reached the destination.)
  - For any pad beyond 7 (i.e., \( k > 7 \)), \( P_k = 0 \) (The frog cannot jump back or beyond pad 7.)

**Step 2: Establish the Recursive Relationship**

- From pad \( k \), the frog can jump to either pad \( k+1 \) or pad \( k+2 \), each with a probability of \( \frac{1}{2} \).
- Therefore, the probability \( P_k \) can be expressed as:
  \[
  P_k = \frac{1}{2}P_{k+1} + \frac{1}{2}P_{k+2}
  \]
  
**Step 3: Calculate Probabilities Starting from Pad 6 Down to Pad 1**

- **Pad 6 (\( P_6 \)):**
  \[
  P_6 = \frac{1}{2}P_7 + \frac{1}{2}P_8 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 + \frac{1}{2} \times 0 = \frac{1}{2}
  \]
  
- **Pad 5 (\( P_5 \)):**
  \[
  P_5 = \frac{1}{2}P_6 + \frac{1}{2}P_7 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4}
  \]
  
- **Pad 4 (\( P_4 \)):**
  \[
  P_4 = \frac{1}{2}P_5 + \frac{1}{2}P_6 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{8}
  \]
  
- **Pad 3 (\( P_3 \)):**
  \[
  P_3 = \frac{1}{2}P_4 + \frac{1}{2}P_5 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{5}{8} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{5}{16} + \frac{3}{8} = \frac{11}{16}
  \]
  
- **Pad 2 (\( P_2 \)):**
  \[
  P_2 = \frac{1}{2}P_3 + \frac{1}{2}P_4 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{11}{16} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{5}{8} = \frac{11}{32} + \frac{5}{16} = \frac{21}{32}
  \]
  
- **Pad 1 (\( P_1 \)):**
  \[
  P_1 = \frac{1}{2}P_2 + \frac{1}{2}P_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{21}{32} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{11}{16} = \frac{21}{64} + \frac{11}{32} = \frac{43}{64}
  \]

**Reflection:**
- *"Each step logically follows from the previous one. The recursive relationship accurately captures the frog's jump probabilities."*

### **Double-Checking the Solution**

**Verification of Calculations:**

- **Pad 6:**  
  \[
  P_6 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 + \frac{1}{2} \times 0 = \frac{1}{2}
  \]
  
- **Pad 5:**  
  \[
  P_5 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = \frac{3}{4}
  \]
  
- **Pad 4:**  
  \[
  P_4 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{8}
  \]
  
- **Pad 3:**  
  \[
  P_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{5}{8} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{11}{16}
  \]
  
- **Pad 2:**  
  \[
  P_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{11}{16} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{5}{8} = \frac{21}{32}
  \]
  
- **Pad 1:**  
  \[
  P_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{21}{32} + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{11}{16} = \frac{43}{64}
  \]
  
**Reflection:**
- *"All calculations align correctly with the recursive relationships. The probabilities decrease as expected from pad 1 to pad 7, with pad 7 having a certainty of 1."*

---

### **Final Answer**

After carefully exploring the recursive approach and verifying each calculation step, **the probability that the frog reaches pad 7 starting from pad 1 is \( \boxed{\dfrac{43}{64}} \)**.
