### Question:
Find the arithmetic mean of all the three-digit palindromes. (Recall that a palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward, such as $777$ or $383$.)

### Answer:
So i need to find the arithmetic mean of all the three-digit palindromes. first, i should understand what a three-digit palindrome is. a palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward, like 121 or 333. for three-digit numbers, that means the first and the third digits are the same.

so, a three-digit palindrome can be represented as 
a
b
a
‾
aba
 , where 
a
a is the first and third digit, and 
b
b is the middle digit. here, 
a
a can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since the number can't start with 0), and 
b
b can be any digit from 0 to 9.

let me think about how many such numbers there are. since 
a
a has 9 possibilities and 
b
b has 10 possibilities, there are 
9
×
10
=
90
9×10=90 three-digit palindromes.

now, i need to find the arithmetic mean of these 90 numbers. the arithmetic mean is just the sum of all the numbers divided by how many there are. so, i need to find the sum of all three-digit palindromes and then divide by 90.

first, let's express the three-digit palindrome 
a
b
a
‾
aba
  in terms of its digits. the number 
a
b
a
‾
aba
  is equal to 
100
a
+
10
b
+
a
=
101
a
+
10
b
100a+10b+a=101a+10b.

so, each palindrome can be written as 
101
a
+
10
b
101a+10b.

now, to find the sum of all such numbers, i can sum this expression over all possible values of 
a
a and 
b
b.

the sum 
s
s is:

s
=
∑
a
=
1
9
∑
b
=
0
9
(
101
a
+
10
b
)
s=∑ 
a=1
9
​
 ∑ 
b=0
9
​
 (101a+10b)
i can separate this into two sums:

s
=
101
∑
a
=
1
9
∑
b
=
0
9
a
+
10
∑
a
=
1
9
∑
b
=
0
9
b
s=101∑ 
a=1
9
​
 ∑ 
b=0
9
​
 a+10∑ 
a=1
9
​
 ∑ 
b=0
9
​
 b
let's evaluate each sum separately.

first, 
∑
a
=
1
9
∑
b
=
0
9
a
∑ 
a=1
9
​
 ∑ 
b=0
9
​
 a.

since 
a
a is independent of 
b
b, for each fixed 
a
a, 
b
b runs from 0 to 9, which is 10 values. so, this sum is:

∑
a
=
1
9
10
a
=
10
∑
a
=
1

a
=

​

a=1

​
 a=10×

9×10
​
 =10×45=450
next, 
∑
a
=

9
∑
b
=
0
9
b
∑ 
a=1
9
​
 ∑ 
b=0

​
 b.

for each 
a
a, the sum over 
b
b from 0 to 9 is 
∑
b
=
0
9
b
=
9
×
10
2
=
45
∑ 
b=0
9
​
 b= 
2
9×10
​
 =45. since 
a
a runs from 1 to 9, this sum is:

∑
a
=
1
9
45
=
9
×
45
=
405
∑ 
a=1
9
​
 45=9×45=405
now, plugging these back into the expression for 
s
s:

s
=
101
×
450
+
10
×
405
=
101
×
450
+
10
×
405
s=101×450+10×405=101×450+10×405
let me calculate 
101
×
450
101×450:

101
×
450
=
(
100
+
1
)
×
450
=
100
×
450
+
1
×
450
=
45000
+
450
=
45450
101×450=(100+1)×450=100×450+1×450=45000+450=45450
and 
10
×
405
=
4050
10×405=4050.

so, 
s
=
45450
+
4050
=
49500
s=45450+4050=49500.

now, the arithmetic mean is 
s
s divided by the number of palindromes, which is 90.

mean
=
49500
90
=
550
mean= 
90
49500
​
 =550
wait a minute, that seems too clean. let me double-check my calculations to make sure i didn't make any mistakes.

first, confirming the number of three-digit palindromes: 
a
a from 1 to 9 and 
b
b from 0 to 9, so indeed 90 numbers.

expressing the palindrome as 
101
a
+
10
b
101a+10b seems correct.

summing over all 
a
a and 
b
b:

s
=
∑
a

∑
b
=

(
101

​
 a=10×45=450. that looks right.

b

∑ 
b=0

​
 b=45, and there are 9 values of 
a
a, so 
9
×
45
=
405
9×45=405. that seems correct.

then, 
s
=
101
×
450
+
10
×
405
=
45450
+
4050
=
49500
s=101×450+10×405=45450+4050=49500.

finally, mean = 
49500
/
90
=
550
49500/90=550.

hmm, that seems correct. but let me think of another way to approach this to confirm.

another approach could be to consider the average value of 
a
a and the average value of 
b
b, and then plug them into the expression 
101
a
+
10
b
101a+10b.

first, the average value of 
a
a is:

average 
a
=
1
+
2
+
⋯
+
9
9
=
45
9
=
5
average a= 
9
1+2+⋯+9
​
 = 
9
45
​
 =5
the average value of 
b
b is:

average 
b
=
0
+
1
+
2
+
⋯
+
9
10
=
45
10
=
4.5
average b= 
10
0+1+2+⋯+9
​
 = 
10
45
​
 =4.5
then, the average palindrome would be:

101
×
5
+
10
×
4.5
=
505
+
45
=
550
101×5+10×4.5=505+45=550
this matches the previous result. so, it seems that the arithmetic mean is indeed 550.

just to be thorough, let me consider the smallest and largest three-digit palindromes and see if this makes sense.

the smallest three-digit palindrome is 101, and the largest is 999.

if i were to naively take the average of 101 and 999, i would get 
101
+
999
2
=
550
2
101+999
​
 =550.

wait, that's the same answer! but this is just the average of the smallest and largest, not the average of all of them. however, since the distribution of palindromes is symmetric around 550, this might make sense.

let me think about it: for every palindrome less than 550, there is a corresponding palindrome greater than 550 that balances it out.

for example, 101 and 999: 
101
+
999
2
=
550
2
101+999
​
 =550

similarly, 111 and 989: 
111
+
989
2
=
550
2
111+989
​
 =550

and so on.

this symmetry suggests that the mean should indeed be 550.

therefore, i'm confident that the arithmetic mean of all three-digit palindromes is 550.

**final answer**

​
To find the arithmetic mean of all three-digit palindromes, we start by representing a three-digit palindrome as 
a
b
a
‾
aba
 , where 
a
a is the first and third digit (ranging from 1 to 9) and 
b
b is the middle digit (ranging from 0 to 9). this can be expressed as 
101
a
+
10
b
101a+10b.

there are 
9

10
=

s=101×450+10×405=45450+4050=49500
the arithmetic mean is then:

mean

therefore, the arithmetic mean of all three-digit palindromes is:
