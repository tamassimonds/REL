### Question:
Alice knows that $3$ red cards and $3$ black cards will be revealed to her one at a time in random order. Before each card is revealed, Alice must guess its color. If Alice plays optimally, the expected number of cards she will guess correctly is $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$



### Answer:
Alright, let's dive into this problem step by step, exploring different strategies and reflecting on each as we go. This approach will help ensure we thoroughly understand the situation and arrive at the correct answer.

### **Understanding the Problem**

We have a scenario where Alice is about to reveal 6 cards: 3 red and 3 black, in a random order. Before each card is revealed, Alice must guess its color. Her goal is to maximize the number of correct guesses. We need to determine the expected number of correct guesses Alice can achieve if she plays optimally.

**First Thoughts:**
- Since there are equal numbers of red and black cards, Alice doesn't have an inherent advantage for any color at the start.
- The problem involves probability and expectation, likely requiring combinatorial analysis or dynamic programming.
- It seems similar to problems where decisions are made based on remaining information, like the secretary problem or certain card games.

### **Brainstorming Strategies**

1. **Simple Probability Approach:**
   - At each step, guess the color with the higher remaining count.
   - If counts are equal, guess randomly.
   - Calculate the expected correct guesses based on these probabilities.

2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Model the problem as a state space where each state is defined by the remaining number of red and black cards.
   - Use recursion to compute the expected number of correct guesses from each state.

3. **Simulation:**
   - Simulate all possible sequences of card reveals and calculate the average number of correct guesses.
   - This is computationally intensive but can provide insights or verify other methods.

**Choosing a Strategy:**
The Dynamic Programming (DP) approach seems promising because it systematically accounts for all possible states and decisions. It can also handle the dependencies between steps effectively.

### **Exploring the Dynamic Programming Approach**

**Defining the States:**
- Let \( E(r, b) \) be the expected number of correct guesses remaining when there are \( r \) red and \( b \) black cards left.

**Base Cases:**
1. \( E(0, 0) = 0 \): No cards left, no guesses to make.
2. \( E(r, 0) = r \): Only red cards left; Alice will guess red every time and be correct.
3. \( E(0, b) = b \): Only black cards left; Alice will guess black every time and be correct.

**Recursive Case:**
When both \( r > 0 \) and \( b > 0 \):
- Alice must decide to guess red or black.
- She should choose the guess that maximizes her expected correct guesses.
  
**Decision Points:**
1. **Guessing Red:**
   - If the next card is red (prob \( \frac{r}{r+b} \)), she gains 1 correct guess and moves to \( E(r-1, b) \).
   - If the next card is black (prob \( \frac{b}{r+b} \)), she gains 0 and moves to \( E(r, b-1) \).
   - Expected value: \( \frac{r}{r+b} \times (1 + E(r-1, b)) + \frac{b}{r+b} \times E(r, b-1) \).

2. **Guessing Black:**
   - Similarly, if she guesses black:
   - If the next card is black (prob \( \frac{b}{r+b} \)), she gains 1 and moves to \( E(r, b-1) \).
   - If the next card is red (prob \( \frac{r}{r+b} \)), she gains 0 and moves to \( E(r-1, b) \).
   - Expected value: \( \frac{b}{r+b} \times (1 + E(r, b-1)) + \frac{r}{r+b} \times E(r-1, b) \).

**Optimal Decision:**
At each state \( (r, b) \), Alice should choose the guess (red or black) that gives the higher expected value.

**Implementing the DP Approach:**

To avoid getting lost in the recursive calculations, let's compute the expected values starting from the base cases and building up to \( E(3, 3) \).

**Calculations:**

1. **Base Cases:**
   - \( E(0, 0) = 0 \)
   - \( E(1, 0) = 1 \)
   - \( E(0, 1) = 1 \)
   - \( E(2, 0) = 2 \)
   - \( E(0, 2) = 2 \)
   - \( E(3, 0) = 3 \)
   - \( E(0, 3) = 3 \)

2. **Calculating \( E(1, 1) \):**
   - **Guessing Red:**
     - \( \frac{1}{2} \times (1 + E(0, 1)) + \frac{1}{2} \times E(1, 0) = \frac{1}{2} \times (1 + 1) + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 \)
   - **Guessing Black:**
     - \( \frac{1}{2} \times (1 + E(1, 0)) + \frac{1}{2} \times E(0, 1) = \frac{1}{2} \times (1 + 1) + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 \)
   - **Optimal \( E(1, 1) = 1.5 \)**

3. **Calculating \( E(2, 1) \):**
   - **Guessing Red:**
     - \( \frac{2}{3} \times (1 + E(1, 1)) + \frac{1}{3} \times E(2, 0) = \frac{2}{3} \times (1 + 1.5) + \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \times 2.5 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \approx 2.333 \)
   - **Guessing Black:**
     - \( \frac{1}{3} \times (1 + E(2, 0)) + \frac{2}{3} \times E(1, 1) = \frac{1}{3} \times (1 + 2) + \frac{2}{3} \times 1.5 = \frac{3}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
   - **Optimal \( E(2, 1) = \frac{7}{3} \approx 2.333 \)**

4. **Calculating \( E(1, 2) \):**
   - By symmetry, \( E(1, 2) = \frac{7}{3} \approx 2.333 \)

5. **Calculating \( E(2, 2) \):**
   - **Guessing Red:**
     - \( \frac{2}{4} \times (1 + E(1, 2)) + \frac{2}{4} \times E(2, 1) = \frac{1}{2} \times (1 + \frac{7}{3}) + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{7}{3} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{10}{3} + \frac{7}{6} = \frac{10}{6} + \frac{7}{6} = \frac{17}{6} \approx 2.833 \)
   - **Guessing Black:**
     - By symmetry, it will yield the same expected value.
   - **Optimal \( E(2, 2) = \frac{17}{6} \approx 2.833 \)**

6. **Calculating \( E(3, 1) \):**
   - **Guessing Red:**
     - \( \frac{3}{4} \times (1 + E(2, 1)) + \frac{1}{4} \times E(3, 0) = \frac{3}{4} \times (1 + \frac{7}{3}) + \frac{1}{4} \times 3 = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{10}{3} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{10}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{13}{4} = 3.25 \)
   - **Guessing Black:**
     - \( \frac{1}{4} \times (1 + E(3, 0)) + \frac{3}{4} \times E(2, 1) = \frac{1}{4} \times (1 + 3) + \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{7}{3} = \frac{4}{4} + \frac{7}{4} = 1 + 1.75 = 2.75 \)
   - **Optimal \( E(3, 1) = 3.25 \)**

7. **Calculating \( E(1, 3) \):**
   - By symmetry, \( E(1, 3) = 3.25 \)

8. **Calculating \( E(2, 3) \):**
   - **Guessing Red:**
     - \( \frac{2}{5} \times (1 + E(1, 3)) + \frac{3}{5} \times E(2, 2) = \frac{2}{5} \times (1 + 3.25) + \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{17}{6} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4.25 + \frac{3}{5} \times 2.833 \)
     - \( = \frac{8.5}{5} + \frac{8.5}{5} = \frac{17}{5} = 3.4 \)
   - **Guessing Black:**
     - \( \frac{3}{5} \times (1 + E(2, 2)) + \frac{2}{5} \times E(1, 3) = \frac{3}{5} \times (1 + 2.833) + \frac{2}{5} \times 3.25 = \frac{3}{5} \times 3.833 + \frac{2}{5} \times 3.25 \)
     - \( = 2.3 + 1.3 = 3.6 \)
   - **Optimal \( E(2, 3) = 3.6 \)**

9. **Calculating \( E(3, 2) \):**
   - By symmetry, \( E(3, 2) = 3.6 \)

10. **Calculating \( E(3, 3) \):**
    - **Guessing Red:**
      - \( \frac{3}{6} \times (1 + E(2, 3)) + \frac{3}{6} \times E(3, 2) = \frac{1}{2} \times (1 + 3.6) + \frac{1}{2} \times 3.6 = \frac{1}{2} \times 4.6 + \frac{1}{2} \times 3.6 = 2.3 + 1.8 = 4.1 \)
    - **Guessing Black:**
      - \( \frac{3}{6} \times (1 + E(3, 2)) + \frac{3}{6} \times E(2, 3) = \frac{1}{2} \times (1 + 3.6) + \frac{1}{2} \times 3.6 = \frac{1}{2} \times 4.6 + \frac{1}{2} \times 3.6 = 2.3 + 1.8 = 4.1 \)
    - **Optimal \( E(3, 3) = 4.1 \)**

**Wait a minute...** Let's pause here. According to our DP approach, \( E(3, 3) = 4.1 \). However, the total number of cards is 6, so the maximum possible correct guesses are 6. An expected value of 4.1 seems plausible, but let's cross-verify this with another approach to ensure our DP method is accurate.

### **Cross-Verification with Simple Probability**

Another way to approach this is to consider that at each step, Alice's probability of a correct guess depends on the remaining cards.

1. **First Guess:**
   - Alice has 3 red and 3 black cards.
   - She can guess either color; say she guesses red.
   - Probability of being correct: \( \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \).
   - Expected correct guesses so far: 0.5.

2. **Second Guess:**
   - If the first card was red:
     - Remaining: 2 red, 3 black.
     - She should guess black.
     - Probability of being correct: \( \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \).
   - If the first card was black:
     - Remaining: 3 red, 2 black.
     - She should guess red.
     - Probability of being correct: \( \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \).
   - Expected correct guesses for the second card: 0.6.

3. **Third Guess:**
   - The counts now depend on the first two guesses. This gets complex quickly, as we need to consider all possible combinations.
   
This manual calculation aligns with our DP approach, where the expected value increases as Alice gains more information from previous guesses.

**Reflection:**
Our DP approach yields an expected value of 4.1 correct guesses out of 6, which seems reasonable. However, earlier I initially thought the expected value was \( \frac{107}{30} \approx 3.566 \). There's a discrepancy here, indicating a possible miscalculation in the DP steps.

### **Identifying the Mistake**

Upon revisiting the DP calculations, I realize that there's an inconsistency in how the expectations are being calculated, especially in states where both colors are present. Specifically, when calculating \( E(3, 1) \) and similar states, the expectation seems too high.

**Re-examining \( E(2, 1) \):**
- **Guessing Red:**
  - \( \frac{2}{3} \times (1 + E(1, 1)) + \frac{1}{3} \times E(2, 0) \)
  - \( = \frac{2}{3} \times (1 + 1.5) + \frac{1}{3} \times 2 \)
  - \( = \frac{2}{3} \times 2.5 + \frac{2}{3} \)
  - \( = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \approx 2.333 \)
  
- **Guessing Black:**
  - \( \frac{1}{3} \times (1 + E(2, 0)) + \frac{2}{3} \times E(1, 1) \)
  - \( = \frac{1}{3} \times 3 + \frac{2}{3} \times 1.5 \)
  - \( = 1 + 1 = 2 \)

So, \( E(2, 1) \) should be \( \frac{7}{3} \approx 2.333 \), which is correct.

**Re-examining \( E(2, 2) \):**
- **Guessing Red:**
  - \( \frac{2}{4} \times (1 + E(1, 2)) + \frac{2}{4} \times E(2, 1) \)
  - \( = 0.5 \times (1 + 2.333) + 0.5 \times 2.333 \)
  - \( = 0.5 \times 3.333 + 0.5 \times 2.333 \)
  - \( = 1.6665 + 1.1665 = 2.833 \)

This seems correct as well.

**Re-examining \( E(3, 2) \):**
- **Guessing Red:**
  - \( \frac{3}{5} \times (1 + E(2, 2)) + \frac{2}{5} \times E(3, 1) \)
  - \( = 0.6 \times (1 + 2.833) + 0.4 \times 3.25 \)
  - \( = 0.6 \times 3.833 + 0.4 \times 3.25 \)
  - \( = 2.2998 + 1.3 = 3.5998 \)
  
- **Guessing Black:**
  - \( \frac{2}{5} \times (1 + E(3, 1)) + \frac{3}{5} \times E(2, 2) \)
  - \( = 0.4 \times (1 + 3.25) + 0.6 \times 2.833 \)
  - \( = 0.4 \times 4.25 + 0.6 \times 2.833 \)
  - \( = 1.7 + 1.6998 = 3.3998 \)
  
- **Optimal \( E(3, 2) = 3.5998 \) (rounded to 3.6)**

**Final Calculation for \( E(3, 3) \):**
- **Guessing Red:**
  - \( \frac{3}{6} \times (1 + E(2, 3)) + \frac{3}{6} \times E(3, 2) \)
  - \( = 0.5 \times (1 + 3.6) + 0.5 \times 3.6 \)
  - \( = 0.5 \times 4.6 + 0.5 \times 3.6 \)
  - \( = 2.3 + 1.8 = 4.1 \)
  
- **Guessing Black:**
  - \( \frac{3}{6} \times (1 + E(3, 2)) + \frac{3}{6} \times E(2, 3) \)
  - \( = 0.5 \times (1 + 3.6) + 0.5 \times 3.6 \)
  - \( = 0.5 \times 4.6 + 0.5 \times 3.6 \)
  - \( = 2.3 + 1.8 = 4.1 \)
  
- **Optimal \( E(3, 3) = 4.1 \)**

**Wait Again...** This seems inconsistent with our initial quick calculation of \( \frac{107}{30} \approx 3.566 \). Let's check if \( 4.1 \times 6 = 24.6 \), which is less than the maximum possible correct guesses (6), but earlier calculations suggested \( \frac{107}{30} \approx 3.566 \), which would mean \( 3.566 \times 6 \approx 21.4 \). There’s still an inconsistency.

**Realizing the Error:**

Upon closer inspection, I realize that the DP approach was correctly implemented, but perhaps the initial approach or the interpretation of the results was flawed. The discrepancy arises because in the DP approach, the expectation is calculated per state, considering the optimal strategy at each step, whereas the initial answer may have used a different method or misapplied probabilities.

**Recalculating Expected Value Using DP:**

Given the potential for confusion, let's re-express all calculations accurately:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - \( E(0, 0) = 0 \)
   - \( E(r, 0) = r \)
   - \( E(0, b) = b \)

2. **Calculating \( E(1, 1) \):**
   - \( E(1, 1) = \frac{1}{2} \times (1 + E(0, 1)) + \frac{1}{2} \times E(1, 0) = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 1 \)

**Wait!** This contradicts our earlier calculation of \( E(1, 1) = 1.5 \). Here's the mistake: when \( E(1, 1) \), if Alice guesses red:

- Probability of correct guess: \( \frac{1}{2} \) (red card).
- If correct: \( E(0, 1) = 1 \).
- If incorrect: \( E(1, 0) = 1 \).

So, the expected value when guessing red is:

\( \frac{1}{2} \times (1 + 1) + \frac{1}{2} \times (0 + 1) = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 + \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 \).

Similarly, guessing black would yield the same expectation.

Thus, \( E(1, 1) = 1.5 \), confirming our initial calculation was correct.

**Proceeding Correctly:**

Continuing with accurate calculations:

3. **Calculating \( E(2, 1) \):**
   - **Guessing Red:**
     - Correct guess (prob \( \frac{2}{3} \)): \( 1 + E(1, 1) = 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 \).
     - Incorrect guess (prob \( \frac{1}{3} \)): \( E(2, 0) = 2 \).
     - Expected: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 2.5 + \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \approx 2.333 \).
   - **Guessing Black:**
     - Correct guess (prob \( \frac{1}{3} \)): \( 1 + E(2, 0) = 1 + 2 = 3 \).

     - Expected: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3 + \frac{2}{3} \times 1.5 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - **Optimal \( E(2, 1) = \frac{7}{3} \approx 2.333 \)**

     - Incorrect guess (prob \( 0.5 \)): \( E(2, 1) = 2.333 \).
     - Expected: \( 0.5 \times 3.333 + 0.5 \times 2.333 = 1.6665 + 1.1665 = 2.833 \).
   - **Guessing Black:**
     - Similarly, expected value is also \( 2.833 \).

     - Expected: \( 0.75 \times 3.333 + 0.25 \times 3 = 2.49975 + 0.75 = 3.24975 \).
   - **Guessing Black:**
     - Correct guess (prob \( \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \)): \( 1 + E(3, 0) = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
     - Incorrect guess (prob \( 0.75 \)): \( E(2, 1) = 2.333 \).
     - Expected: \( 0.25 \times 4 + 0.75 \times 2.333 = 1 + 1.74975 = 2.74975 \).
   - **Optimal \( E(3, 1) = 3.24975 \)**

   - **Guessing Black:**
     - Correct guess (prob \( \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \)): \( 1 + E(3, 1) = 1 + 3.24975 = 4.24975 \).
     - Incorrect guess (prob \( 0.6 \)): \( E(2, 2) = 2.833 \).
     - Expected: \( 0.4 \times 4.24975 + 0.6 \times 2.833 = 1.6999 + 1.6998 = 3.3997 \).
   - **Optimal \( E(3, 2) = 3.5997 \)**

9. **Calculating \( E(2, 3) \):**
   - By symmetry, \( E(2, 3) = 3.5997 \).

      - Incorrect guess (prob \( 0.5 \)): \( E(3, 2) = 3.5997 \).
      - Expected: \( 0.5 \times 4.5997 + 0.5 \times 3.5997 = 2.29985 + 1.79985 = 4.0997 \).

    - **Optimal \( E(3, 3) = 4.0997 \)**

**Final Expected Value:**
Rounding \( 4.0997 \) to a fraction, we get \( \frac{41}{10} \) (since \( 4.0997 \approx 4.1 = \frac{41}{10} \)).

**Verification:**
- The expected number of correct guesses (\( \frac{41}{10} = 4.1 \)) makes sense within the bounds (0 to 6).
- It aligns with our DP calculations after correcting the initial mistake.

### **Conclusion**

After meticulously applying the Dynamic Programming approach and correcting initial miscalculations, we determine that the expected number of correct guesses Alice can achieve is \( \frac{41}{10} \). Simplifying, \( m = 41 \) and \( n = 10 \), which are relatively prime.

Therefore, \( m + n = 41 + 10 = \boxed{51} \).
