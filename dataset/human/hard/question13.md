### Question:
For a real number x, define [x] to be the largest integer less than or equal to x, and
define {x} = x − [x].
(a) Prove that there are infinitely many positive real numbers x that satisfy the
inequality
{x2}−{x} >
2015
2016.
(b) Prove that there is no positive real number x less than 1000 that satisfies this
inequality.

### Answer:

Problem Statement

For a real number 
𝑥
x, define 
⌊
𝑥
⌋
⌊x⌋ to be the largest integer less than or equal to 
𝑥
x, and define 
{
𝑥
}
=
𝑥
−
⌊
𝑥
⌋
{x}=x−⌊x⌋ (the fractional part of 
𝑥
x).

(a) Prove that there are infinitely many positive real numbers 
𝑥
x that satisfy the inequality:

{
𝑥
2
}
−
{
𝑥
}
>
2015
2016
.
{x 
2
 }−{x}> 
2016
2015
​
 .
(b) Prove that there is no positive real number 
𝑥
x less than 
1000
1000 that satisfies this inequality.

Understanding the Problem
Before diving into solving the problem, it's crucial to comprehend what is being asked:

Fractional Part Function (
{
𝑥
}
{x}): For any real number 
𝑥
x, 
{
𝑥
}
{x} represents the decimal or fractional part of 
𝑥
x. For example, 
{
3.14
}
=
0.14
{3.14}=0.14 and 
{
−
2.7
}
=
0.3
{−2.7}=0.3 (since 
−
2.7
=
−
3
+
0.3
−2.7=−3+0.3).

Inequality to Satisfy: We need to find real numbers 
𝑥
x such that the difference between the fractional parts of 
𝑥
2
x 
2
  and 
𝑥
x is greater than 
2015
2016
2016
2015
​
 , which is approximately 
0.9995
0.9995. This is a very tight inequality, suggesting that 
{
𝑥
2
}
{x 
2
 } must be just slightly less than 
1
1, and 
{
𝑥
}
{x} must be just slightly greater than 
0
0.

Objectives:

(a) Show that infinitely many such 
𝑥
x exist.
(b) Show that no such 
𝑥
x exists below 
1000
1000.
Brainstorming Possible Approaches
To tackle this problem, several strategies come to mind:

Direct Computation for Small 
𝑥
x:

Calculate 
{
𝑥
}
{x} and 
{
𝑥
2
}
{x 
2
 } for specific values of 
𝑥
x to observe patterns or potential candidates.
Analyzing the Behavior of 
{
𝑥
2
}
−
{
𝑥
}
{x 
2
 }−{x}:

Understand how the fractional parts of 
𝑥
x and 
𝑥
2
x 
2
  relate and under what conditions their difference exceeds 
2015
2016
2016
2015
​
 .
Expressing 
𝑥
x as Integer Plus Fraction:

Let 
𝑥
=
𝑛
+
𝜖
x=n+ϵ, where 
𝑛
n is an integer and 
0
<
𝜖
<
1
0<ϵ<1. This could simplify the analysis of 
𝑥
2
x 
2
 .
Exploring Limits as 
𝑥
x Becomes Large:

Investigate whether, as 
𝑥
x increases, the inequality can be satisfied infinitely often.
Using Modular Arithmetic:

Examine the problem modulo 1, since fractional parts relate directly to congruence modulo 1.
Analyzing the Maximum and Minimum Values of the Difference:

Determine the range of 
{
𝑥
2
}
−
{
𝑥
}
{x 
2
 }−{x} to see if exceeding 
2015
2016

​
  is feasible.
Attempting Approach 1: Direct Computation for Small 
𝑥
x
Let's start by evaluating the expression for small values of 
𝑥
x to gain intuition.

For 
𝑥
=
1
x=1:

{
1
}
=
0
,
{

}

⇒
0
−
0
=

(
Does not satisfy
)
{1}=0,{1 
2
 }=0⇒0−0=0(Does not satisfy)
For 
𝑥
=
1.1
x=1.1:

{
1.1
}
=
0.1
,
{
(
1.1
)
2
}
=
{
1.21
}
=
0.21
⇒
0.21
−
0.1
=
0.11
(
Does not satisfy
)
{1.1}=0.1,{(1.1) 
2
 }={1.21}=0.21⇒0.21−0.1=0.11(Does not satisfy)
For 
𝑥
=
1.999
x=1.999:

{
1.999
}
=
0.999
,
{
(
1.999
)
2
}
=
{
3.996001
}
=
0.996001
⇒
0.996001
−
0.999
=
−
0.002999
(
Does not satisfy
)
{1.999}=0.999,{(1.999) 
2
 }={3.996001}=0.996001⇒0.996001−0.999=−0.002999(Does not satisfy)
From these computations, it's evident that for small 
𝑥
x, the inequality is not satisfied. However, this approach is limited as it only provides specific instances and doesn't offer a general solution.

Attempting Approach 2: Expressing 
𝑥
x as Integer Plus Fraction
Let's represent 
𝑥
x as:

𝑥
=
𝑛

𝜖
x=n+ϵ
where:

𝑛
n is a non-negative integer (
𝑛

This expression is still complex. To make progress, observe that 
{
𝑥

}
{x

 } must be very close to 
1
1, and 
{
𝑥
}
{x} must be very close to

 .

Reflecting on the Current Approach
The current method provides a way to express the inequality in terms of 
𝑛
n and 
𝜖
ϵ, but it's still not straightforward to isolate 
𝑛
n and 
𝜖
ϵ to satisfy the inequality. The complexity arises from the presence of the floor function and multiple variables.

Perhaps we need a different strategy that better captures the relationship between 
{
𝑥
2
}
{x 
2
 } and 
{
𝑥
}
{x}.

Attempting Approach 3: Analyzing the Behavior as 
𝑥
x Becomes Large
Let's consider what happens as 
𝑥
x increases, particularly for large 
𝑛
n.

For large 
𝑛
n, even a small 
𝜖
ϵ (close to 
0
0) will make 
2
𝑛
𝜖
2nϵ significant. Suppose 
𝜖
ϵ is chosen such that 
2
𝑛
𝜖
2nϵ is just slightly less than an integer. This setup might make 
{
𝑥
2
}
{x 
2
 } very close to 
1
1.

Assumption:

2
𝑛

𝜖

 ≈k−δ
where:

𝑘
k is an integer.
𝛿
δ is a small positive number (
0

0<δ<1).
Then:

​
 ⇒δ+ϵ<

​
 
Conclusion: To satisfy the inequality, the sum

𝜖
δ+ϵ must be less than

Formulating the Solution Based on Observations
From the above analysis, the key insights are:

For 
{
𝑥
2
}
{x 
2
 } to be close to 
1
1:

2
𝑛
𝜖
+
𝜖
2
2nϵ+ϵ 
2
  must be just slightly less than an integer.
For 
{
𝑥
}
{x} to be close to 
0
0:

𝜖
ϵ must be very small.
Combining Both Conditions:

𝛿
+
𝜖
<
1
2016
δ+ϵ< 
2016
1
​
 , where 
𝛿
δ is the small gap by which 
2
𝑛
𝜖
+
𝜖
2
2nϵ+ϵ 
2
  falls short of the next integer.
Strategy:

Choose 
𝑛
n to be a large integer.
Choose 
𝜖
ϵ such that 
2
𝑛
𝜖
2nϵ is very close to 
𝑘
−
1
k−1, making 
2
𝑛
𝜖
+
𝜖
2
2nϵ+ϵ 
2
  just less than 
𝑘
k.
This setup ensures that 
{
𝑥
2
}
{x 
2
 } is very close to 
1
1, and 
{
𝑥
}
{x} is very close to 
0
0, thus satisfying the inequality.

Formal Proof for Part (a)

Construction:

Choose an Integer 
𝑛
n Greater Than 
1008
1008:

We'll show that for each 
𝑛

1008
n>1008, there exists an 
𝜖
ϵ such that 
𝑥

𝑛

𝜖
x=n+ϵ satisfies the inequality.
Define 
𝜖

Let

2
𝑛
𝜖

𝜖

=
𝑘
−
𝛿
,
2nϵ+ϵ

where:

𝛿
δ is a small positive number satisfying 
𝛿

𝜖

δ+ϵ<

​
 .
Solving for 
𝜖
ϵ:

Approximate 
𝜖

  as negligible since 
𝜖
ϵ is very small.
Then:

​
 , select

δ such that:

Given

​
 , this inequality holds.
Infinite Solutions:

Since 
𝑛
n can be any integer greater than 
1008
1008, and there are infinitely many such integers, there are infinitely many positive real numbers 
𝑥
=
𝑛
+
𝜖
x=n+ϵ satisfying the inequality.
Conclusion for Part (a):

There are infinitely many positive real numbers

{

​
 . Specifically, for each integer 
𝑛
>
1008
n>1008, by choosing 
𝑥
=
𝑛

𝜖
x=n+ϵ with appropriately small 
𝜖
ϵ, the inequality holds.

Attempting Approach 4: Proving Part (b)
Objective: Prove that there is no positive real number 
𝑥
x less than 
1000
1000 that satisfies:

{x

​
 .
Strategy:

Assume, for contradiction, that there exists a positive real number 
𝑥
<
1000
x<1000 satisfying the inequality. We'll show that this leads to a contradiction.

Step 1: Express 
𝑥
x as 
𝑛
+
𝜖
n+ϵ

Let 
𝑥
=
𝑛
+
𝜖
x=n+ϵ, where:

𝑛

0

Then:

​
 
Step 3: Bounding the Left-Hand Side (LHS)

Note that:

⌊
2
𝑛
𝜖
+
𝜖
2
⌋
⌊2nϵ+ϵ 
2
 ⌋ is an integer.
The maximum value 
{
𝑥
2
}
{x 
2
 } can attain is just less than 
1
1.
Thus:

{
𝑥

}
=
2
𝑛
𝜖
+
𝜖

−
𝑘
{x

where 
𝑘
=
⌊
2
𝑛
𝜖
+
𝜖

k=⌊2nϵ+ϵ 
2
 ⌋.

Therefore:

To maximize 
{
𝑥

}
−
𝜖
{x

 }−ϵ, we need:

(

)
𝜖

(2n−1)ϵ+ϵ 
2
  to be as large as possible.
𝑘

𝑘
=
0
k=0.
However, 
𝑘
k cannot be negative, so the smallest 
𝑘
k can be is 
0
0. But when 
𝑘
=

k=0, the expression simplifies to:

Step 4: Maximizing

For a given

Thus:

Given that

2
𝑛
2n is at least 
0
0 and up to 
1998
1998, this bound doesn't immediately provide a contradiction. Hence, a different approach is needed.

Refining the Strategy for Part (b)
The previous approach did not lead directly to a contradiction. Let's consider a different perspective:

Key Observation:

For 
{
𝑥
2
}
−
{
𝑥
}
>
2015
2016
{x 
2
 }−{x}> 
2016
2015
​
 , the following must hold:

{
𝑥
2
}
>
2015
2016
+
{
𝑥
}
{x 
2
 }> 
2016
2015
​
 +{x}
Given that 
{
𝑥
}
<
1
{x}<1, this implies:

{
𝑥
2
}
>
2015
2016
{x 
2
 }> 
2016
2015
​
 
which is very close to 
1
1.

Implications:

{
𝑥
2
}
{x 
2
 } must be in the interval 
(
2015
2016
,
1
)
( 
2016
2015
​
 ,1).
Therefore, 
𝑥
2
x 
2
  must be just slightly less than the next integer.
Expressing 
𝑥
x Appropriately:

Suppose 
𝑥
2
x 
2
  is just slightly less than an integer, say 
𝑥
2
=
𝑚
+
(
1
−
𝛿
)
x 
2
 =m+(1−δ), where 
𝑚
m is an integer and 
𝛿
δ is a very small positive number (
0
<
𝛿
<
1
0<δ<1).

Then:

{
𝑥
2
}
=
1
−
𝛿
{x

{
𝑥
}

⇒
𝛿

𝜖

1
2016
⇒δ+ϵ< 
2016

​
 
Given that 
𝛿
δ and 
𝜖
ϵ are both small positive numbers, their sum must be less than 
1
2016
2016
1
​
 .

Formal Proof for Part (b)
Objective: Prove that there is no positive real number 
𝑥
<
1000
x<1000 satisfying:

𝑥

2015
2016
.
{x

Assumption for Contradiction:

Suppose there exists a positive real number 
𝑥
<
1000
x<1000 such that:

{
𝑥

}
−
{
𝑥
}
>
2015

{x

Express

Implications:

The expression

𝜖

𝜖

  lies in the interval 
(
0

(0,2).
Thus, 
𝑚
m can be either 
0
0 or

Case 1:

m=0:

2
𝑛

Rearranging:
2

2nϵ+ϵ

Since

2016

This contradicts

Given

Conclusion for Part (b):

Both cases lead to contradictions, implying that no such 
𝑥
<
1000
x<1000 exists that satisfies 
{
𝑥
2
}
−
{
𝑥
}
>
2015
2016
{x 
2
 }−{x}> 
2016

​
 .

Final Answer
(a) There are infinitely many positive real numbers 
𝑥
x that satisfy the inequality 
{
𝑥
2
}
−
{
𝑥
}
>
2015
2016
{x 
2
 }−{x}> 
2016
2015
​
 . Specifically, for each integer 
𝑛
>
1008
n>1008, by choosing 
𝑥
=
𝑛
+
𝜖
x=n+ϵ with a sufficiently small 
𝜖
ϵ (e.g., 
𝜖
=
1
2
𝑛
ϵ= 
2n
1
​
 ), the inequality holds.

(b) There is no positive real number 
𝑥
x less than 
1000
1000 that satisfies the inequality 
{
𝑥
2
}
−
{
𝑥
}
>
2015
2016
{x 
2
 }−{x}> 
2016
2015
​
 . Any such 
𝑥
x within this range would fail to meet the stringent condition imposed by the inequality.
