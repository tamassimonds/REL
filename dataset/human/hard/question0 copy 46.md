### Question:

Find the number of subsets of $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$ that are subsets of neither $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ nor $\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$.

### Answer:
Ah, I see I made an error in my previous solution. Let me take a step back and re-examine the problem carefully to ensure accuracy.

**Problem Recap:**
We need to determine the number of subsets of the set \( U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\} \) that are **neither** subsets of \( A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \) **nor** subsets of \( B = \{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\} \).

**Initial Thoughts:**
At first glance, this seems like a problem that can be tackled using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I recall that inclusion-exclusion is useful for finding the number of elements in the union of overlapping sets by accounting for their intersections.

**First Approach:**
1. **Total Number of Subsets of \( U \):**
   Since \( U \) has 8 elements, the total number of subsets is \( 2^8 = 256 \).

2. **Subsets of \( A \):**
   \( A \) has 5 elements, so the number of subsets of \( A \) is \( 2^5 = 32 \).

3. **Subsets of \( B \):**
   Similarly, \( B \) has 5 elements, yielding \( 2^5 = 32 \) subsets.

4. **Intersection of \( A \) and \( B \):**
   \( A \cap B = \{4, 5\} \), which has 2 elements. Thus, the number of subsets of \( A \cap B \) is \( 2^2 = 4 \).

5. **Applying Inclusion-Exclusion:**
   To find the number of subsets that are **either** subsets of \( A \) or \( B \):
   \[
   |P(A) \cup P(B)| = |P(A)| + |P(B)| - |P(A) \cap P(B)| = 32 + 32 - 4 = 60
   \]

6. **Subtracting from Total:**
   The number of subsets that are **neither** subsets of \( A \) nor \( B \) would then be:
   \[
   256 - 60 = 196
   \]

**Pause for Reflection:**
Wait a minuteâ€”does this approach fully capture the condition that subsets are **neither** of \( A \) nor \( B \)? Let me double-check the logic.

**Identifying the Potential Issue:**
The initial approach calculates the number of subsets that are **either** subsets of \( A \) or \( B \), then subtracts that from the total to get subsets that are **neither**. However, I need to ensure that the interpretation aligns precisely with the problem statement.

**Re-defining the Condition:**
A subset \( S \) of \( U \) is **neither** a subset of \( A \) **nor** a subset of \( B \) if:
- \( S \) is **not** entirely contained within \( A \).
- \( S \) is **not** entirely contained within \( B \).

This means \( S \) must contain at least one element **not** in \( A \) and at least one element **not** in \( B \). Specifically:
- At least one element from \( U \setminus A = \{6, 7, 8\} \).
- At least one element from \( U \setminus B = \{1, 2, 3\} \).

**Revising the Approach:**
Given this refined understanding, perhaps the initial inclusion-exclusion method doesn't directly account for these specific constraints. Let's consider an alternative strategy.

**Alternative Strategy:**
Use complementary counting by focusing on the required elements that must be present in the subsets.

1. **Define Sets:**
   - Let \( C = \{1, 2, 3\} \) (elements not in \( B \)).
   - Let \( D = \{6, 7, 8\} \) (elements not in \( A \)).

2. **Condition for Desired Subsets:**
   - Subsets must contain **at least one** element from \( C \).
   - Subsets must contain **at least one** element from \( D \).

3. **Counting Subsets That Satisfy Both Conditions:**
   - Total subsets of \( U \): \( 2^8 = 256 \).
   - Subsets **without** any elements from \( C \): These subsets can only include elements from \( U \setminus C = \{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\} \), so \( 2^5 = 32 \) subsets.
   - Subsets **without** any elements from \( D \): These subsets can only include elements from \( U \setminus D = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \), so \( 2^5 = 32 \) subsets.
   - Subsets **without** any elements from both \( C \) and \( D \): These can only include elements from \( U \setminus (C \cup D) = \{4, 5\} \), so \( 2^2 = 4 \) subsets.

4. **Applying Inclusion-Exclusion for the Complement:**
   - Number of subsets **missing** \( C \) or \( D \):
     \[
     | \text{Missing } C | + | \text{Missing } D | - | \text{Missing both } C \text{ and } D | = 32 + 32 - 4 = 60
     \]
   
5. **Desired Subsets:**
   - Subsets containing at least one element from both \( C \) and \( D \):
     \[
     \text{Total Subsets} - \text{Subsets Missing } C \text{ or } D = 256 - 60 = 196
     \]

**Cross-Verification:**
Interestingly, both the initial inclusion-exclusion approach and the alternative strategy yield the same result of **196** subsets. This consistency suggests that, despite my initial hesitation, the original method was indeed correct.

**Conclusion:**
After thoroughly re-examining the problem and exploring an alternative counting strategy, I've confirmed that the number of subsets of \( U \) that are neither subsets of \( A \) nor subsets of \( B \) is:

\[
\boxed{196}
\]
