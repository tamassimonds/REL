### Question:
Azar, Carl, Jon, and Sergey are the four players left in a singles tennis tournament. They are randomly assigned opponents in the semifinal matches, and the winners of those matches play each other in the final match to determine the winner of the tournament. When Azar plays Carl, Azar will win the match with probability $\frac23$. When either Azar or Carl plays either Jon or Sergey, Azar or Carl will win the match with probability $\frac34$. Assume that outcomes of different matches are independent. The probability that Carl will win the tournament is $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.


### Answer:
Let's tackle this problem step by step. we've got four players: azar, carl, jon, and sergey. they're in a singles tennis tournament, and we need to find the probability that carl wins the tournament. the matches are set up with semifinals and then a final, and the opponents are assigned randomly in the semifinals.

first, i need to understand the structure of the tournament. there are two semifinal matches, and the winners of those matches will play each other in the final. since the opponents are assigned randomly, i should consider all possible pairings in the semifinals.

let's list out all possible ways to pair the four players into two matches. the possible pairings are:

1. azar vs carl and jon vs sergey

2. azar vs jon and carl vs sergey

3. azar vs sergey and carl vs jon

i think these are the only distinct ways to pair them up, right? because any other pairing would just be a permutation of these.

now, for each of these pairings, i need to calculate the probability that carl wins the tournament. since the outcomes of different matches are independent, i can treat each match separately.

let's start with the first pairing: azar vs carl and jon vs sergey.

in this case, the semifinal matches are azar vs carl and jon vs sergey.

we know that when azar plays carl, azar wins with probability 2/3, so carl wins with probability 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.

for the match between jon and sergey, since neither is azar or carl, and the problem states that when either azar or carl plays either jon or sergey, azar or carl will win with probability 3/4. but in this match, it's jon vs sergey, both are not azar or carl, so i need to figure out what happens here.

wait a minute, the problem says: "when either azar or carl plays either jon or sergey, azar or carl will win the match with probability 3/4." but in this match, it's jon vs sergey, so neither azar nor carl is playing. the problem doesn't specify what happens in this case.

i need to interpret this. maybe it implies that if azar or carl is not playing, then the probability of either player winning is equal, since there's no indication of favoritism. so, perhaps jon and sergey each have a 1/2 chance of winning against each other.

alternatively, maybe there's another way to interpret it. the problem states that "when either azar or carl plays either jon or sergey, azar or carl will win the match with probability 3/4." since in this match, neither azar nor carl is playing, maybe it's implied that jon and sergey have an equal chance of winning, so each has a 1/2 probability.

i'll go with that for now: jon vs sergey is a 50-50 match.

so, in the first pairing:

- azar vs carl: carl wins with probability 1/3

- jon vs sergey: let's say jon wins with probability 1/2, sergey with 1/2

now, the winners of these two matches play in the final. so, to have carl win the tournament, he needs to win his semifinal and then win the final against whoever wins the other semifinal.

so, let's consider the possible paths:

1. carl beats azar (prob 1/3), and jon beats sergey (prob 1/2), then carl beats jon in the final.

2. carl beats azar (prob 1/3), and sergey beats jon (prob 1/2), then carl beats sergey in the final.

in both subcases, carl needs to win the final against either jon or sergey.

the problem states that when either azar or carl plays either jon or sergey, azar or carl will win with probability 3/4. so, in the final, if carl plays jon or sergey, carl will win with probability 3/4.

therefore:

- path 1: carl beats azar (1/3) * jon beats sergey (1/2) * carl beats jon (3/4)

- path 2: carl beats azar (1/3) * sergey beats jon (1/2) * carl beats sergey (3/4)

so, the total probability for this pairing is:

(1/3 * 1/2 * 3/4) + (1/3 * 1/2 * 3/4) = 2 * (1/3 * 1/2 * 3/4) = 2 * (1/3 * 1/2 * 3/4) = 2 * (1/8) = 1/4

wait, let's check the arithmetic:

1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6

1/6 * 3/4 = 1/8

yes, so two such paths, each with probability 1/8, so total 1/4 for this pairing.

now, let's consider the second pairing: azar vs jon and carl vs sergey.

in this case:

- azar vs jon: azar or jon is playing, but since azar is one of azar or carl, the rule applies: azar or carl will win with probability 3/4.

so, azar vs jon: azar or carl (azar in this case) will win with probability 3/4, so azar wins with 3/4, jon with 1/4.

- carl vs sergey: similarly, carl vs sergey: carl is one of azar or carl, so carl will win with probability 3/4, sergey with 1/4.

now, the winners play in the final.

to have carl win the tournament, he needs to:

1. beat sergey in the semifinal (prob 3/4)

2. then beat the winner of azar vs jon in the final.

so, the path is:

carl beats sergey (3/4) * [if azar wins semifinal (prob 3/4), then carl beats azar in the final; or if jon wins semifinal (prob 1/4), then carl beats jon in the final].

wait, actually, in the final, the winner of azar vs jon plays the winner of carl vs sergey.

so, if carl beats sergey (3/4), and azar beats jon (3/4), then in the final, carl vs azar.

if carl beats sergey (3/4), and jon beats azar (1/4), then in the final, carl vs jon.

so, the probability is:

carl beats sergey (3/4) * [azar beats jon (3/4) * carl beats azar in final + jon beats azar (1/4) * carl beats jon in final]

now, when carl plays azar, azar wins with probability 2/3, so carl wins with 1/3.

when carl plays jon, azar or carl will win with probability 3/4, so carl wins with 3/4.

therefore, the probability for this path is:

3/4 * [3/4 * 1/3 + 1/4 * 3/4] = 3/4 * [ (3/4 * 1/3) + (1/4 * 3/4) ) ] = 3/4 * [ 1/4 + 3/16 ] = 3/4 * [ (4/16 + 3/16) ] = 3/4 * 7/16 = 21/64

so, for this pairing, the probability that carl wins is 21/64.

now, let's look at the third pairing: azar vs sergey and carl vs jon.

similarly:

- azar vs sergey: azar or carl (azar in this case) will win with probability 3/4, so azar wins with 3/4, sergey with 1/4.

- carl vs jon: carl is one of azar or carl, so carl wins with 3/4, jon with 1/4.

then, winners play in the final.

for carl to win the tournament:

1. carl beats jon in semifinal (3/4)

2. then, in final, he plays the winner of azar vs sergey.

so, the path is:

carl beats jon (3/4) * [azar beats sergey (3/4) * carl beats azar in final + sergey beats azar (1/4) * carl beats sergey in final]

now, carl vs azar: carl wins with 1/3.

carl vs sergey: carl wins with 3/4.

so, the probability is:

3/4 * [3/4 * 1/3 + 1/4 * 3/4] = 3/4 * [1/4 + 3/16] = 3/4 * [ (4/16 + 3/16) ] = 3/4 * 7/16 = 21/64

interesting, same as the previous pairing.

so, for this pairing, carl has a 21/64 chance of winning the tournament.

now, since the pairings are equally likely, and there are three possible pairings, each with probability 1/3, we need to average the probabilities of carl winning across these pairings.

wait, actually, is that correct? are all pairings equally likely?

let's think about how the opponents are assigned randomly.

there are c(3,1) = 3 ways to assign opponents for one player, say azar, and then the other two play each other.

so, yes, there are three equally likely pairings.

therefore, the total probability that carl wins is:

(1/3)*(1/4) + (1/3)*(21/64) + (1/3)*(21/64)

wait, no. in the first pairing, we had 1/4, and in the other two pairings, 21/64 each.

but actually, in the first pairing, the probability was 1/4, and in the other two, it's 21/64 each.

so, total probability is:

(1/3)*(1/4) + (1/3)*(21/64) + (1/3)*(21/64) = (1/12) + (21/192) + (21/192)

to add these, find a common denominator, which is 192.

1/12 = 16/192

21/192 + 21/192 = 42/192

so, total is 16/192 + 42/192 = 58/192

simplify 58/192: divide numerator and denominator by 2, get 29/96.

therefore, the probability that carl wins is 29/96.

but wait, i need to make sure that i didn't make a mistake in calculating the first pairing.

in the first pairing, azar vs carl and jon vs sergey, and we got 1/4.

in the second and third pairings, both gave 21/64.

but 21/64 is approximately 0.328, and 1/4 is 0.25, so the average would be (0.25 + 0.328 + 0.328)/3 ≈ 0.299, which is close to 29/96 ≈ 0.302.

but perhaps i should double-check the calculations for the first pairing.

wait, in the first pairing, azar vs carl and jon vs sergey.

probability that carl wins the semifinal: 1/3

probability that jon wins the semifinal: 1/2

then, in final, carl vs jon: carl wins with 3/4.

similarly, if sergey wins the other semifinal, carl vs sergey: carl wins with 3/4.

so, the total is 1/3 * [ (1/2 * 3/4) + (1/2 * 3/4) ] = 1/3 * (3/8 + 3/8) = 1/3 * 6/8 = 1/3 * 3/4 = 1/4

yes, that seems correct.

and in the other pairings, it's 21/64 each.

so, averaging them: (1/4 + 21/64 + 21/64)/3

convert to a common denominator, say 192.

1/4 = 48/192

21/64 = 63/192

so, (48 + 63 + 63)/192 = 174/192 = 29/32

wait, that can't be right, because earlier i had 58/192.

wait, let's recalculate.

wait, 1/4 is 48/192

21/64 is 63/192

so, 48 + 63 + 63 = 174

174/192 = 29/32

wait, but earlier i had 58/192, which is 29/96.

wait, there's an inconsistency here.

wait, perhaps i need to think differently.

since each pairing is equally likely, with probability 1/3, the total probability is:

(1/3)*(1/4) + (1/3)*(21/64) + (1/3)*(21/64)

calculate each term:

1/3 * 1/4 = 1/12

1/3 * 21/64 = 21/192

similarly, the other 1/3 * 21/64 = 21/192

so, total is 1/12 + 21/192 + 21/192

convert 1/12 to 16/192

so, 16/192 + 21/192 + 21/192 = 58/192 = 29/96

wait, but earlier i thought 1/4 is 48/192, but actually 1/4 is 48/192, but 1/3 * 1/4 is 1/12 = 16/192.

yes, that's correct.

so, total is 16 + 21 + 21 = 58, over 192, which simplifies to 29/96.

therefore, the probability that carl wins is 29/96.

so, p = 29, q = 96, and they are relatively prime.

thus, p + q = 29 + 96 = 125.

**final answer**
