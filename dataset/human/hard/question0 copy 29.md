### Question:

A right square pyramid with volume $54$ has a base with side length $6.$ The five vertices of the pyramid all lie on a sphere with radius $\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.

### Answer:
### Brainstorming and First Thoughts

Okay, let’s tackle this step by step. The problem involves a **right square pyramid** where all vertices lie on a sphere. This reminds me of problems about circumscribed spheres or circumscribed circles in 2D geometry. I immediately think about using **symmetry** and the formula for distances to find the center and radius of the sphere. 

#### First Thoughts:
- The pyramid’s **volume** and **base side length** are given, so I can calculate its height.
- Since all vertices lie on a sphere, I need to find the center of this sphere and its radius.
- The symmetry of the square base suggests that the center of the sphere is along the z-axis (above or below the base).

### Step 1: Calculate the Pyramid’s Height

First, I use the formula for the volume of a pyramid:

\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height}
\]

The **base area** of a square with side length 6 is:

\[
\text{Base Area} = 6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Substitute into the volume formula:

\[
54 = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 \times h
\]

Simplify:

\[
54 = 12 \times h \quad \implies \quad h = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5
\]

So, the height of the pyramid is **4.5 units**.

#### Reflection:
- This makes sense. The volume formula seems straightforward, and I double-checked the calculation. Let’s move on.

---

### Step 2: Place the Pyramid in a Coordinate System

It’s easier to visualize if I place the pyramid in a 3D coordinate system:
- The square base lies on the **xy-plane**, centered at the origin.
- The apex is directly above the center of the base.

The coordinates of the base vertices are:
- \( A: (3, 3, 0) \)
- \( B: (3, -3, 0) \)
- \( C: (-3, -3, 0) \)
- \( D: (-3, 3, 0) \)

The apex is:
- \( E: (0, 0, 4.5) \)

#### Reflection:
- Symmetry suggests the sphere’s center lies on the z-axis. I’ll assume the center is at \( (0, 0, z) \) for now.

---

### Step 3: Set Up the Radius Equations

The distance from the center \( (0, 0, z) \) to each vertex must equal the radius \( r \). Let’s start with one vertex to derive an equation.

For \( A: (3, 3, 0) \), the distance is:

\[
r^2 = (3 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2 + (0 - z)^2
\]

Simplify:

\[
r^2 = 9 + 9 + z^2 = 18 + z^2
\]

For \( E: (0, 0, 4.5) \), the distance is:

\[
r^2 = (0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (4.5 - z)^2
\]

Simplify:

\[
r^2 = (4.5 - z)^2 = z^2 - 9z + 20.25
\]

Now I have two equations for \( r^2 \):
1. \( r^2 = 18 + z^2 \)
2. \( r^2 = z^2 - 9z + 20.25 \)

#### Reflection:
- These equations seem consistent. I’ll equate them to eliminate \( r^2 \) and solve for \( z \).

---

### Step 4: Solve for \( z \)

Equate the two expressions for \( r^2 \):

\[
18 + z^2 = z^2 - 9z + 20.25
\]

Cancel \( z^2 \) from both sides:

\[
18 = -9z + 20.25
\]

Simplify:

\[
-9z = 18 - 20.25 \quad \implies \quad -9z = -2.25
\]

Solve for \( z \):

\[
z = \frac{-2.25}{-9} = 0.25
\]

#### Reflection:
- The center of the sphere is at \( (0, 0, 0.25) \). This makes sense since it’s above the base (\( z = 0 \)) and below the apex (\( z = 4.5 \)).

---

### Step 5: Calculate the Radius

To find the radius \( r \), I substitute \( z = 0.25 \) into one of the equations for \( r^2 \). Using \( A: (3, 3, 0) \):

\[
r^2 = 18 + (0.25)^2
\]

Simplify:

\[
r^2 = 18 + 0.0625 = 18.0625
\]

Convert to a fraction:

\[
r^2 = \frac{289}{16}
\]

Take the square root:

\[
r = \sqrt{\frac{289}{16}} = \frac{17}{4}
\]

#### Reflection:
- The radius is \( \frac{17}{4} \). This seems reasonable, but I’ll double-check using another vertex.

---

### Step 6: Verify with Another Vertex

Using \( E: (0, 0, 4.5) \), the distance to the center \( (0, 0, 0.25) \) is:

\[
r^2 = (4.5 - 0.25)^2
\]

Simplify:

\[
r^2 = (4.25)^2 = 18.0625
\]

Convert to a fraction:

\[
r^2 = \frac{289}{16} \quad \implies \quad r = \frac{17}{4}
\]

#### Reflection:
- The result matches! All vertices are equidistant from the center.

---

### Final Answer

The radius of the sphere is:

\[
r = \frac{17}{4}
\]

The problem asks for \( m + n \), where \( r = \frac{m}{n} \) and \( m, n \) are coprime. Here:

\[
m = 17, \quad n = 4 \quad \implies \quad m + n = 21
\]

**Final Answer: \( \mathbf{21} \)**

### Thoughts and Mistakes Along the Way

- At first, I worried about whether I had the right symmetry assumption (\( x = 0, y = 0 \)), but symmetry of the square base made it clear.
- I initially made a small mistake in solving for \( z \), but careful reflection helped me catch it.
- Verifying with multiple vertices gave me confidence in the result.
