### Question:


The numbers of apples growing on each of six apple trees form an arithmetic sequence where the greatest number of apples growing on any of the six trees is double the least number of apples growing on any of the six trees. The total number of apples growing on all six trees is $990.$ Find the greatest number of apples growing on any of the six trees.

### Answer:
Ah, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's walk through the problem again, this time taking a more detailed and reflective approach to ensure accuracy.

### **Problem Recap:**
We have six apple trees with the number of apples on each forming an arithmetic sequence. The greatest number of apples on any tree is double the least number. The total number of apples across all six trees is 990. We need to find the greatest number of apples on any tree.

### **Initial Thoughts and Brainstorming:**

When I first read the problem, I recognize that it's about arithmetic sequences, which have a constant difference between consecutive terms. The conditions given involve both the relationship between the greatest and least number of apples and the total sum of apples.

My immediate thoughts:
- **Arithmetic Sequence Basics:** I recall that in an arithmetic sequence, each term increases by a common difference \( d \).
- **Given Conditions:**
  - **Condition 1:** The greatest number is double the least number.
  - **Condition 2:** The sum of all six terms is 990.

I need to find the greatest number, so I'll likely need to express the sequence in terms of variables and apply the given conditions to solve for those variables.

---

### **Attempting the Solution:**

**1. Define the Arithmetic Sequence:**
- Let the smallest number of apples be \( a \).
- Let the common difference be \( d \).
- Therefore, the six terms of the sequence are:
  \[
  a, \quad a + d, \quad a + 2d, \quad a + 3d, \quad a + 4d, \quad a + 5d
  \]

**2. Apply the Given Condition (Greatest is Double the Least):**
- The greatest number is \( a + 5d \).
- According to the condition: \( a + 5d = 2a \).
- Simplifying: \( 5d = a \).

**3. Express the Sequence in Terms of \( d \):**
- Substitute \( a = 5d \) into the sequence:
  \[
  5d, \quad 6d, \quad 7d, \quad 8d, \quad 9d, \quad 10d
  \]

**4. Calculate the Total Number of Apples:**
- Sum of the sequence: \( 5d + 6d + 7d + 8d + 9d + 10d = 45d \).
- Given that the total is 990: \( 45d = 990 \).
- Solving for \( d \): \( d = \frac{990}{45} = 22 \).

**5. Find the Greatest Number of Apples:**
- Greatest number: \( 10d = 10 \times 22 = 220 \).

**6. Verification:**
- Let's list out the sequence with \( d = 22 \):
  \[
  5d = 110, \quad 6d = 132, \quad 7d = 154, \quad 8d = 176, \quad 9d = 198, \quad 10d = 220
  \]
- Sum: \( 110 + 132 + 154 + 176 + 198 + 220 = 990 \).

At this point, everything seems to check out. However, the user indicated that there might be an error. To ensure I haven't overlooked anything, I'll revisit each step critically.

---

### **Re-examining Each Step:**

**Step 2:** 
- **Condition Application:** \( a + 5d = 2a \) leads to \( 5d = a \). This seems straightforward and correct.

**Step 3:** 
- **Sequence Representation:** Substituting \( a = 5d \) gives the sequence \( 5d, 6d, 7d, 8d, 9d, 10d \). This is accurate.

**Step 4:** 
- **Sum Calculation:** Summing up the sequence \( 5d + 6d + 7d + 8d + 9d + 10d = 45d \). Given \( 45d = 990 \), solving for \( d \) yields \( d = 22 \). This is correct.

**Step 5:** 
- **Greatest Number:** \( 10d = 220 \) is accurate.

**Step 6:** 
- **Verification:** The sequence sums up to 990, matching the given total.

### **Considering Alternative Approaches:**

To be thorough, let's try an alternative method to solve the problem and see if it corroborates our initial solution.

**Alternative Method: Using the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence**

1. **Recall the Formula:**
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{First Term} + \text{Last Term})
   \]
   Where:
   - \( S \) is the sum of the sequence.
   - \( n \) is the number of terms.
   - The first term is \( a \).
   - The last term is \( a + 5d \).

2. **Apply the Given Conditions:**
   - Number of terms \( n = 6 \).
   - Sum \( S = 990 \).
   - Greatest number \( a + 5d = 2a \) â†’ \( 5d = a \).

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   \[
   990 = \frac{6}{2} \times (a + 2a) = 3 \times 3a = 9a
   \]
   \[
   9a = 990 \Rightarrow a = 110
   \]
   - Since \( a = 5d \), \( d = \frac{a}{5} = \frac{110}{5} = 22 \).

4. **Find the Greatest Number:**
   \[
   a + 5d = 110 + 5 \times 22 = 110 + 110 = 220
   \]

5. **Verification:**
   - Sequence: \( 110, 132, 154, 176, 198, 220 \).
   - Sum: \( 110 + 132 + 154 + 176 + 198 + 220 = 990 \).

Both methods lead to the same conclusion.

### **Final Conclusion:**

After carefully re-examining each step and employing an alternative method to verify, I confirm that the initial solution is correct.

**The greatest number of apples growing on any of the six trees is** \(\boxed{220}\).
