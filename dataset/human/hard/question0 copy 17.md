### Question:


The numbers of apples growing on each of six apple trees form an arithmetic sequence where the greatest number of apples growing on any of the six trees is double the least number of apples growing on any of the six trees. The total number of apples growing on all six trees is $990.$ Find the greatest number of apples growing on any of the six trees.

### Answer:


### **Understanding the Problem**

**First Thoughts:**
- "We have six apple trees, and the number of apples on each tree forms an arithmetic sequence. That means each tree has a constant difference in the number of apples compared to the previous one."
- "The greatest number of apples on any tree is double the least number. Interesting constraint!"
- "The total number of apples across all trees is 990. I need to find out how many apples the tree with the most apples has."

---

### **Brainstorming Solutions**

**Exploring Strategies:**
1. **Define the Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - Let's denote the first term (least number of apples) as \( a \).
   - The common difference between each term as \( d \).
   - So, the sequence will be: \( a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, a + 4d, a + 5d \).

2. **Use the Given Constraints:**
   - The greatest number of apples (\( a + 5d \)) is double the least number (\( a \)): \( a + 5d = 2a \).
   - The sum of all apples is 990: \( a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) + (a + 4d) + (a + 5d) = 990 \).

**Reflection:**
- "Okay, setting up these equations seems straightforward. Solving them should give me the values I need."

---

### **Solving the Equations**

**Step 1: Relate \( a \) and \( d \)**
- From the condition \( a + 5d = 2a \):
  \[
  a + 5d = 2a \\
  5d = 2a - a \\
  5d = a \\
  d = \frac{a}{5}
  \]
  
**Thought Process:**
- "Great, now I have \( d \) in terms of \( a \). This will help simplify the sum equation."

**Step 2: Express the Sum in Terms of \( a \)**
- The sum of the sequence:
  \[
  S = 6a + 15d = 990
  \]
  (Since \( a + (a + d) + \ldots + (a + 5d) = 6a + 15d \))
  
**Substituting \( d = \frac{a}{5} \) into the sum equation:**
  \[
  6a + 15\left(\frac{a}{5}\right) = 990 \\
  6a + 3a = 990 \\
  9a = 990 \\
  a = \frac{990}{9} \\
  a = 110
  \]
  
**Reflection:**
- "So, the least number of apples on any tree is 110. Let's find the common difference \( d \)."

**Step 3: Find \( d \)**
  \[
  d = \frac{a}{5} = \frac{110}{5} = 22
  \]
  
**Thought Process:**
- "With \( a = 110 \) and \( d = 22 \), I can now list out the number of apples on each tree."

---

### **Listing the Number of Apples on Each Tree**

1. **1st Tree:** \( a = 110 \)
2. **2nd Tree:** \( 110 + 22 = 132 \)
3. **3rd Tree:** \( 132 + 22 = 154 \)
4. **4th Tree:** \( 154 + 22 = 176 \)
5. **5th Tree:** \( 176 + 22 = 198 \)
6. **6th Tree:** \( 198 + 22 = 220 \)

**Quick Check:**
- "Let's add these up to ensure the total is 990."
  \[
  110 + 132 = 242 \\
  242 + 154 = 396 \\
  396 + 176 = 572 \\
  572 + 198 = 770 \\
  770 + 220 = 990
  \]
  
- "Perfect, the sum matches the given total."

**Reflection:**
- "Also, the greatest number of apples is 220, which is double the least number, 110. Everything checks out."

---

### **Considering an Alternative Scenario**

**Exploring Another Approach:**
- "What if the common difference was negative? That would mean the number of apples decreases with each tree."

**Adjusting the Equations:**
- If \( d \) is negative, the first term would be the greatest, and the sixth term the least.
- Using the condition \( a = 2(a + 5d) \):
  \[
  a = 2(a + 5d) \\
  a = 2a + 10d \\
  -a = 10d \\
  d = -\frac{a}{10}
  \]
  
**Substituting into the Sum Equation:**
  \[
  6a + 15d = 990 \\
  6a + 15\left(-\frac{a}{10}\right) = 990 \\
  6a - 1.5a = 990 \\
  4.5a = 990 \\
  a = \frac{990}{4.5} \\
  a = 220
  \]
  
**Finding \( d \):**
  \[
  d = -\frac{220}{10} = -22
  \]
  
**Listing the Numbers:**
1. **1st Tree:** \( 220 \)
2. **2nd Tree:** \( 220 - 22 = 198 \)
3. **3rd Tree:** \( 198 - 22 = 176 \)
4. **4th Tree:** \( 176 - 22 = 154 \)
5. **5th Tree:** \( 154 - 22 = 132 \)
6. **6th Tree:** \( 132 - 22 = 110 \)
  
**Quick Check:**
  \[
  220 + 198 = 418 \\
  418 + 176 = 594 \\
  594 + 154 = 748 \\
  748 + 132 = 880 \\
  880 + 110 = 990
  \]
  
- "Again, the sum is 990, and the greatest number is 220, which is double the least number, 110."

**Reflection:**
- "Whether the sequence is increasing or decreasing, the greatest number of apples remains 220. This confirms our solution is consistent."

---

### **Final Answer**

After carefully exploring both increasing and decreasing scenarios and verifying the sums, **the greatest number of apples on any of the six trees is 220**.
