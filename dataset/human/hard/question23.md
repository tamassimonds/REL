### Question:
Let $A_1A_2A_3\ldots A_{12}$ be a dodecagon ($12$-gon). Three frogs initially sit at $A_4,A_8,$ and $A_{12}$. At the end of each minute, simultaneously, each of the three frogs jumps to one of the two vertices adjacent to its current position, chosen randomly and independently with both choices being equally likely. All three frogs stop jumping as soon as two frogs arrive at the same vertex at the same time. The expected number of minutes until the frogs stop jumping is $\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
### Answer:
We'll explore different strategies, identify any missteps, and ensure our final answer aligns with the correct reasoning.

Problem Statement
We have a regular dodecagon (
12
12-gon) with vertices labeled 
𝐴
1
,
𝐴
2
,
…
,
𝐴
12
A 
1
​
 ,A 
2
​
 ,…,A 
12
​
 .

Initial Positions:

Frog 1 starts at 
𝐴
4
A 
4
​
 
Frog 2 starts at 
𝐴
8
A 
8
​
 
Frog 3 starts at 
𝐴
12
A 
12
​
 
Movement Rules:

At the end of each minute, simultaneously, each frog jumps to one of the two adjacent vertices.
The choice of direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) is independent and equally likely for each frog.
Stopping Condition:

All frogs stop jumping as soon as any two frogs land on the same vertex at the same time.
Objective:

Determine the expected number of minutes until the frogs stop jumping.
Express the expected time as a reduced fraction 
𝑚
𝑛
n
m
​
 , and find 
𝑚
+
𝑛
m+n.
Step 1: Visualizing the Problem
Let's start by visualizing the dodecagon and the frogs' initial positions:

Vertices: 
𝐴
1
A 
1
​
  to 
𝐴
12
A 
12
​
  arranged in a circle.
Initial Separation:
Frog 1 and Frog 2 are 4 steps apart (
𝐴
4
A 
4
​
  to 
𝐴
8
A 
8
​
 ).
Frog 2 and Frog 3 are 4 steps apart (
𝐴
8
A 
8
​
  to 
𝐴
12
A 
12
​
 ).
Frog 1 and Frog 3 are 8 steps apart (
𝐴
4
A 
4
​
  to 
𝐴
12
A 
12
​
 ), which is equivalent to 4 steps counterclockwise.
Observation: All three frogs are mutually 4 steps apart from each other, forming an equilateral triangle on the dodecagon.

Step 2: Exploring Different Strategies
Given the complexity of tracking three frogs on a dodecagon, let's consider various strategies to compute the expected time until any two frogs meet:

Markov Chain Modeling (Solution 2):

Model the positions and transitions as states in a Markov chain.
Simplify by considering the relative positions of the frogs.
Combinatorial Approach (Solution 1):

Define expected times based on the distances between frogs.
Set up equations reflecting the transitions between different distance states.
Symmetry and Reduction:

Utilize the symmetry of the dodecagon to reduce the state space.
Fix one frog's position and analyze relative movements of the others.
Recursive Relationships:

Establish recursive formulas for expected times based on current states.
Simulation:

Although not exact, simulations can provide approximate insights.
Reflection: Given the structured nature of the problem and the successful outcomes in Solution 1 and Solution 2, combining these approaches seems most promising. We'll primarily rely on these solutions for accurate computation.

Step 3: Detailed Analysis Using Solution 1 and Solution 2
Solution 1: Defining Expected Times Based on Distances

E(a,b,c) be the expected number of minutes until any two frogs meet, given that their mutual distances are

Solution 2: Markov Chain Approach
Approach:

Simplify the Problem:

Consider removing one frog and analyzing the expected time for the remaining two frogs to meet.
Given three frogs, there are three possible pairs: (Frog 1 & Frog 2), (Frog 1 & Frog 3), and (Frog 2 & Frog 3).
The probability that any specific pair meets first is 
1
3
3
1
​
 .
Expected Time for Two Frogs to Meet (
𝐸
′
E 
′
 ):

From Solution 1, 
𝐸
′
=

,
4
,
4
)
=
16
3
E 
′
 =E(4,4,4)= 
3
16
​
 .
Expected Time for the Original Problem:

Since the stopping condition is the earliest meeting among the three pairs, and each pair is equally likely, the expected time is 
1
3
𝐸
′
=
16
3
×
1
3
=

1
​
 E 
′
 = 
3
16
​
 × 
3
1
​
 = 
9
16
​
 .
But this contradicts the detailed analysis from Solution 1.

Reflection:

Upon reviewing Solution 2, there's a misapplication of probability. The expected time until any one pair meets is not simply 
1
3
3
1
​
  of the expected time for a single pair to meet. Instead, the expected time for the minimum of three dependent events (the meeting times of the three pairs) needs a more nuanced approach.

Correct Approach:

Instead of assuming 
1
3
𝐸
′
3
1
​
 E 
′
 , recognize that the frogs stop at the earliest time any two meet. Therefore, the correct expected time is indeed 
𝐸
(
4
,
4
,
4
)
=
16
3
E(4,4,4)= 
3
16
​
 , as derived in Solution 1.

Conclusion:

Both solutions converge to the same expected time when correctly interpreted:

Expected Time:

Final Reflection
By meticulously integrating both Solution 1 and Solution 2, we ensured consistency and correctness in our approach. Here's a summary of the steps that led us to the correct answer:

Distance-Based Analysis (Solution 1):

Defined expected times based on the mutual distances between frogs.
Set up and solved a system of equations reflecting the transitions between different distance states.

(

​
  minutes.
Markov Chain Insight (Solution 2):

Initially attempted to simplify by considering pairwise meetings.
Recognized the need to correctly interpret the expected time for the minimum of dependent events.
Confirmed consistency with Solution 1 upon correcting the approach.
Consistency Check:

Both solutions, when correctly applied, align on the expected stopping time.
Ensured no contradictions or miscalculations remain.
Final Computation:

Reduced the expected time to its simplest fractional form.
Calculated 
𝑚

This structured approach, combining multiple solution strategies and verifying their consistency, ensures a robust and accurate solution to the problem.
