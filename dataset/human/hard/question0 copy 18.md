### Question:

Let $S$ be the set of all positive rational numbers $r$ such that when the two numbers $r$ and $55r$ are written as fractions in lowest terms, the sum of the numerator and denominator of one fraction is the same as the sum of the numerator and denominator of the other fraction. The sum of all the elements of $S$ can be expressed in the form $\frac{p}{q},$ where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q.$

### Answer:
Alright, let's dive into this problem together. I'll walk you through my thought process as I tackle it, exploring different strategies, checking for correctness along the way, and adjusting my approach as needed.

**Problem Statement:**
Let \( S \) be the set of all positive rational numbers \( r \) such that when \( r \) and \( 55r \) are written as fractions in lowest terms, the sum of the numerator and denominator of one fraction is the same as the sum of the numerator and denominator of the other fraction. The sum of all the elements of \( S \) can be expressed in the form \( \frac{p}{q} \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \( p + q \).

**First Thoughts:**
Hmm, we're dealing with rational numbers and their representations in lowest terms. The condition involves the sums of numerators and denominators being equal for \( r \) and \( 55r \). My initial thought is to express \( r \) as a fraction and analyze how multiplying by 55 affects its reduced form.

**Strategy Exploration:**
1. **Express \( r \) as a reduced fraction:** Let’s denote \( r = \frac{a}{b} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime positive integers.

2. **Express \( 55r \) as a reduced fraction:** Then, \( 55r = \frac{55a}{b} \). However, this might not be in lowest terms, so we need to reduce it.

3. **Find the reduced form of \( 55r \):** To reduce \( \frac{55a}{b} \), we divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (gcd). Since \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime, the gcd of \( 55a \) and \( b \) is the same as the gcd of \( 55 \) and \( b \), denoted as \( g = \gcd(55, b) \).

   So, the reduced form of \( 55r \) is \( \frac{55a/g}{b/g} = \frac{55a}{g} \) over \( \frac{b}{g} \).

4. **Set up the condition for equal sums:** The problem states that the sum of the numerator and denominator of one fraction equals the sum of the numerator and denominator of the other. So,

   \[
   a + b = \frac{55a}{g} + \frac{b}{g}
   \]

   Simplifying:

   \[
   a + b = \frac{55a + b}{g}
   \]

   Multiply both sides by \( g \):

   \[
   g(a + b) = 55a + b
   \]

   Rearranging:

   \[
   g(a + b) - b = 55a
   \]

   \[
   a(g - 55) + b(g - 1) = 0
   \]

**Reflection Point:**
Wait, does this equation help us find \( a \) and \( b \)? It seems a bit abstract. Maybe I need to consider possible values of \( g \), since \( g = \gcd(55, b) \). What are the possible values of \( g \)?

**Continuing the Strategy:**
Since \( g \) is the gcd of 55 and \( b \), and 55 factors into \( 5 \times 11 \), the possible values for \( g \) are the positive divisors of 55:

\[
g \in \{1, 5, 11, 55\}
\]

**Case Analysis:**

1. **Case 1: \( g = 1 \)**
   
   Plugging into the equation:

   \[
   a(1 - 55) + b(1 - 1) = 0 \\
   -54a + 0 = 0 \\
   -54a = 0 \\
   \]

   This implies \( a = 0 \), but \( a \) must be a positive integer. Contradiction! So, \( g = 1 \) doesn't yield a valid solution.

2. **Case 2: \( g = 5 \)**
   
   Plugging in:

   \[
   a(5 - 55) + b(5 - 1) = 0 \\
   -50a + 4b = 0 \\
   \]

   Simplify:

   \[
   50a = 4b \\
   25a = 2b \\
   \]

   Since \( a \) and \( b \) are integers, \( b \) must be a multiple of 25, and \( a \) must be a multiple of 2. Let’s set \( a = 2k \) and \( b = 25k \) for some integer \( k \).

   But \( a \) and \( b \) must be coprime. If \( a = 2k \) and \( b = 25k \), their gcd is \( k \). To have \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \), \( k \) must be 1.

   Therefore, \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 25 \). So, \( r = \frac{2}{25} \).

   **Quick Check:**
   
   \( 55r = 55 \times \frac{2}{25} = \frac{110}{25} = \frac{22}{5} \). Both fractions are in lowest terms.

   Sum of numerator and denominator for \( r \):

   \[
   2 + 25 = 27
   \]

   Sum for \( 55r \):

   \[
   22 + 5 = 27
   \]

   Condition satisfied! \( r = \frac{2}{25} \) is a valid solution.

3. **Case 3: \( g = 11 \)**
   
   Plugging in:

   \[
   a(11 - 55) + b(11 - 1) = 0 \\
   -44a + 10b = 0 \\
   \]

   Simplify:

   \[
   44a = 10b \\
   22a = 5b \\
   \]

   Similar to before, let’s express \( a \) and \( b \) in terms of a common multiple. Let \( a = 5k \) and \( b = 22k \) for some integer \( k \).

   Again, \( \gcd(a, b) = k \). To have \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \), \( k \) must be 1.

   Therefore, \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 22 \). So, \( r = \frac{5}{22} \).

   **Quick Check:**
   
   \( 55r = 55 \times \frac{5}{22} = \frac{275}{22} = \frac{25}{2} \). Both fractions are in lowest terms.

   Sum of numerator and denominator for \( r \):

   \[
   5 + 22 = 27
   \]

   Sum for \( 55r \):

   \[
   25 + 2 = 27
   \]

   Condition satisfied! \( r = \frac{5}{22} \) is another valid solution.

4. **Case 4: \( g = 55 \)**
   
   Plugging in:

   \[
   a(55 - 55) + b(55 - 1) = 0 \\
   0a + 54b = 0 \\
   \]

   This simplifies to:

   \[
   54b = 0 \\
   \]

   Which implies \( b = 0 \). However, \( b \) must be a positive integer. Contradiction! So, \( g = 55 \) doesn't yield a valid solution.

**Compiling the Solutions:**
From the above cases, we have two valid solutions for \( r \):

\[
r = \frac{2}{25} \quad \text{and} \quad r = \frac{5}{22}
\]

**Summing the Elements of \( S \):**
Now, we need to find the sum of all elements in \( S \):

\[
\frac{2}{25} + \frac{5}{22}
\]

To add these fractions, we find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 25 and 22 is 550.

\[
\frac{2}{25} = \frac{2 \times 22}{25 \times 22} = \frac{44}{550} \\
\frac{5}{22} = \frac{5 \times 25}{22 \times 25} = \frac{125}{550} \\
\]

Adding them together:

\[
\frac{44}{550} + \frac{125}{550} = \frac{169}{550}
\]

**Final Check:**
Is \( \frac{169}{550} \) in lowest terms? Let's verify by finding the gcd of 169 and 550.

- 169 is a prime number (since \( 13^2 = 169 \), but 13 is prime).
- 550 factors into \( 2 \times 5^2 \times 11 \).

Since 169 shares no common factors with 550, the fraction is already in lowest terms.

**Conclusion:**
The sum of all elements in \( S \) is \( \frac{169}{550} \), where \( p = 169 \) and \( q = 550 \). Therefore,

\[
p + q = 169 + 550 = \boxed{719}
\]
