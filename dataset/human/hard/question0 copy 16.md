### Question:

Recall that a palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. Find the greatest integer less than $1000$ that is a palindrome both when written in base ten and when written in base eight, such as $292 = 444_{\text{eight}}.$



### Answer:

Ah, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's walk through the problem again, step by step, to identify where things went wrong and arrive at the correct answer.

**Problem Statement:**
Find the greatest integer less than \(1000\) that is a palindrome both in base ten and base eight. For example, \(292_{10} = 444_8\) is such a number.

**Initial Thoughts:**
- A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.
- We need to consider numbers below \(1000\) in base ten and check if their base eight representations are also palindromic.
- The number must satisfy this property in both bases.

**First Approach:**
1. **List all palindromic numbers in base ten below \(1000\):**
   - They can be one-digit (\(1\) to \(9\)), two-digit (\(11, 22, \ldots, 99\)), or three-digit (\(101, 111, \ldots, 999\)).

2. **Convert each palindromic number to base eight and check if it's a palindrome:**
   - Start from the largest palindromic number below \(1000\) and work downward.

**Attempted Solution:**
In my previous attempt, I identified \(414_{10}\) as the greatest such number because its base eight representation is \(636_8\), which is also a palindrome.

**Realization of the Error:**
Wait a minute—let me double-check the base eight conversion of \(414_{10}\):
- \(414 \div 8 = 51\) with a remainder of \(6\).
- \(51 \div 8 = 6\) with a remainder of \(3\).
- \(6 \div 8 = 0\) with a remainder of \(6\).
- Reading the remainders backward: \(636_8\).

So, \(636_8\) is indeed a palindrome. But is \(414_{10}\) the greatest such number? Let me verify by checking larger palindromic numbers.

**Re-evaluating the Approach:**
Perhaps starting from \(999\) and moving downward, checking each palindromic number, would ensure we don't miss a larger valid number.

**Detailed Step-by-Step Check:**

1. **Start with the largest three-digit palindrome below \(1000\): \(999_{10}\).**
   - Convert to base eight:
     - \(999 \div 8 = 124\) with a remainder of \(7\).
     - \(124 \div 8 = 15\) with a remainder of \(4\).
     - \(15 \div 8 = 1\) with a remainder of \(7\).
     - \(1 \div 8 = 0\) with a remainder of \(1\).
     - Base eight: \(1747_8\).
   - Is \(1747_8\) a palindrome? No, because \(1747 \neq 7471\).

2. **Next palindrome: \(989_{10}\).**
   - Convert to base eight:
     - \(989 \div 8 = 123\) with a remainder of \(5\).
     - \(123 \div 8 = 15\) with a remainder of \(3\).
     - \(15 \div 8 = 1\) with a remainder of \(7\).
     - \(1 \div 8 = 0\) with a remainder of \(1\).
     - Base eight: \(1735_8\).
   - Is \(1735_8\) a palindrome? No.

3. **Next palindrome: \(979_{10}\).**
   - Convert to base eight:
     - \(979 \div 8 = 122\) with a remainder of \(3\).
     - \(122 \div 8 = 15\) with a remainder of \(2\).
     - \(15 \div 8 = 1\) with a remainder of \(7\).
     - \(1 \div 8 = 0\) with a remainder of \(1\).
     - Base eight: \(1723_8\).
   - Is \(1723_8\) a palindrome? No.

4. **Continue this process:**
   - \(969_{10} \rightarrow 1671_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(959_{10} \rightarrow 1657_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(949_{10} \rightarrow 1645_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(939_{10} \rightarrow 1633_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(929_{10} \rightarrow 1621_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(919_{10} \rightarrow 1607_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(909_{10} \rightarrow 1605_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(899_{10} \rightarrow 1603_8\) → Not a palindrome.

**Reaching \(898_{10}\):**
- \(898_{10}\) is not a palindrome. Wait, my mistake. It should be \(898\), but since we're checking palindromic numbers, let's skip to the next valid palindrome: \(898\) is not palindromic; the next is \(888_{10}\).

5. **Check \(888_{10}\):**
   - Convert to base eight:
     - \(888 \div 8 = 111\) with a remainder of \(0\).
     - \(111 \div 8 = 13\) with a remainder of \(7\).
     - \(13 \div 8 = 1\) with a remainder of \(5\).
     - \(1 \div 8 = 0\) with a remainder of \(1\).
     - Base eight: \(1570_8\).
   - Is \(1570_8\) a palindrome? No.

6. **Continuing downward:**
   - \(878_{10} \rightarrow 1576_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(868_{10} \rightarrow 1564_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(858_{10} \rightarrow 1552_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(848_{10} \rightarrow 1540_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(838_{10} \rightarrow 1526_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(828_{10} \rightarrow 1514_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(818_{10} \rightarrow 1502_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(808_{10} \rightarrow 1470_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(798_{10} \rightarrow 1466_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(788_{10} \rightarrow 1454_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(778_{10} \rightarrow 1442_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(768_{10} \rightarrow 1430_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(758_{10} \rightarrow 1416_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(748_{10} \rightarrow 1404_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(738_{10} \rightarrow 1372_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(728_{10} \rightarrow 1360_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(718_{10} \rightarrow 1356_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(708_{10} \rightarrow 1344_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(698_{10} \rightarrow 1332_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(688_{10} \rightarrow 1320_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(678_{10} \rightarrow 1306_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(668_{10} \rightarrow 1274_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(658_{10} \rightarrow 1262_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(648_{10} \rightarrow 1250_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(638_{10} \rightarrow 1236_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(628_{10} \rightarrow 1224_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   - \(618_{10} \rightarrow 1212_8\) → **Is this a palindrome?** Yes! \(1212_8\) reads the same forwards and backwards.

**Verification:**
- **Base Ten:** \(618_{10}\) is a palindrome? Wait, no. \(618\) reversed is \(816\), which is not the same. There's a mistake here.
  
Hold on, let's double-check:
- \(618_{10}\) is not a palindrome in base ten. I mistakenly considered it because its base eight representation \(1212_8\) appeared palindromic. However, the number itself isn't palindromic in base ten. This means it doesn't satisfy both conditions.

**Realizing the Oversight:**
I realize now that my approach has a flaw. I was checking for palindromic base eight representations without ensuring that the base ten number itself is palindromic. This caused confusion.

**Revising the Approach:**
To avoid such mistakes, I should:
1. **List all base ten palindromic numbers below \(1000\)** in descending order.
2. **For each number, convert it to base eight**.
3. **Check if the base eight representation is also a palindrome**.
4. **Stop at the first number that satisfies both conditions**.

**Executing the Correct Approach:**

1. **List of three-digit palindromes below \(1000\) in descending order:**
   - \(999, 989, 979, 969, 959, 949, 939, 929, 919, 909, 899, 888, 878, \ldots\)

2. **Check each for base eight palindrome:**

   - **\(999_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1747_8\) → Not a palindrome.
   
   - **\(989_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1735_8\) → Not a palindrome.

**Verification:**
- **Base Ten:** \(578_{10}\) is a palindrome? No, \(578\) reversed is \(875\), which is not the same.
  
Oops, another oversight. It seems I've again confused the base eight representation with the base ten palindrome requirement. \(578\) is not a palindrome in base ten, so it doesn't satisfy both conditions.

**Adjusting the Strategy:**
Given these repeated mistakes, it's clear that my approach needs refinement. Here's a better strategy:
1. **Generate all base ten palindromic numbers below \(1000\) in descending order.**
2. **For each number, convert it to base eight.**
3. **Check if the base eight representation is also a palindrome.**
4. **Ensure that both conditions are met simultaneously.**

**Implementing the Correct Strategy:**

1. **List of base ten palindromes below \(1000\) (descending):**
   - \(999, 989, 979, 969, 959, 949, 939, 929, 919, 909,\)
   - \(898, 888, 878, 868, 858, 848, 838, 828, 818, 808,\)
   - \(797, 787, 777, 767, 757, 747, 737, 727, 717, 707,\)
   - \(\ldots\) (and so on down to single-digit palindromes)

2. **Check each number:**

   - **\(999_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1747_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(989_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1735_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(979_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1723_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(969_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1671_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(888_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1570_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(878_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1576_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(868_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1564_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(858_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1552_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(848_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1540_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(838_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1526_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(828_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1514_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(818_{10}\):**

     - Base eight: \(1435_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(787_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1423_8\) → Not a palindrome.

     - Base eight: \(1411_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(767_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1367_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(757_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1355_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(747_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1343_8\) → Not a palindrome.

   - **\(737_{10}\):**
     - Base eight: \(1331_8\) → **Is this a palindrome?** Yes!

**Final Verification:**
- **Base Ten:** \(737_{10}\) is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
- **Base Eight:** \(1331_8\) is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

**Conclusion:**
After a thorough and corrected approach, the greatest integer less than \(1000\) that is a palindrome in both base ten and base eight is:

\(\boxed{737}\)


Ah, I see I've made an error in my previous solution. Let's tackle the problem again from the beginning, carefully walking through each step to ensure accuracy.

---

**Problem Statement:**
Find the greatest integer less than \(1000\) that is a palindrome in both base ten and base eight.

---

**Initial Thoughts:**
- **Palindrome Definition:** A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.
- **Dual Base Condition:** The number must be a palindrome in both base ten and base eight.
- **Range:** We're looking for the largest such number below \(1000\) in base ten.
  
This problem reminds me of finding numbers that satisfy multiple base representations simultaneously, which can be tricky. I need a systematic approach to ensure I don't miss any candidates or make calculation errors.

---

**Brainstorming Strategies:**
1. **List All Base Ten Palindromes Below 1000:**
   - Palindromic numbers can have one, two, or three digits.
   - Three-digit palindromes are of the form \( \text{aba} \), where \(a\) and \(b\) are digits, and \(a \neq 0\).

2. **Convert Each Palindrome to Base Eight:**
   - For each palindromic number in base ten, convert it to base eight.
   - Check if the base eight representation is also a palindrome.

3. **Optimize the Search:**
   - Start checking from the largest possible palindromic number below \(1000\) and move downward. This way, the first number that satisfies both conditions will be our answer.

---

**Implementing the Strategy:**

1. **Generating Base Ten Palindromes Below 1000:**
   - **Three-Digit Palindromes:** \(999, 989, 979, \ldots, 101\)
   - **Two-Digit Palindromes:** \(99, 88, \ldots, 11\)
   - **One-Digit Palindromes:** \(9, 8, \ldots, 1\)
   
   Since we're seeking the greatest number, I'll focus primarily on three-digit palindromes.

2. **Converting to Base Eight and Checking for Palindromes:**
   - **Method for Conversion:**
     - Divide the number by 8, record the remainder.
     - Continue dividing the quotient by 8 until the quotient is zero.
     - The base eight number is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.

   - **Checking for Palindromicity:**
     - After conversion, verify if the sequence of digits reads the same forwards and backwards.
