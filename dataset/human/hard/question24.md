### Question:
Circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ with radii $961$ and $625$, respectively, intersect at distinct points $A$ and $B$. A third circle $\omega$ is externally tangent to both $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. Suppose line $AB$ intersects $\omega$ at two points $P$ and $Q$ such that the measure of minor arc $\widehat{PQ}$ is $120^{\circ}$. Find the distance between the centers of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$.
### Answer:
We are given two circles, 
𝜔
1
ω 
1
​
  and 
𝜔
2
ω 
2
​
 , with radii 
961
961 and 
625
625 respectively. These circles intersect at distinct points 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B. A third circle, 
𝜔
ω, is externally tangent to both 
𝜔
1
ω 
1
​
  and 
𝜔
2
ω 
2
​
 . The line 
𝐴
𝐵
AB intersects 
𝜔
ω at two points 
𝑃
P and 
𝑄
Q such that the measure of the minor arc 
𝑃
𝑄
^
PQ
​
  on 
𝜔
ω is 
12
0
∘
120 
∘
 . Our goal is to determine the distance between the centers of 
𝜔
1
ω 
1
​
  and 
𝜔
2
ω 
2
​
 .

Step 1: Visualizing the Configuration

To tackle this problem effectively, it's beneficial to create a mental (or physical) sketch of the given configuration:

Circles 
𝜔
1
ω 
1
​
  and 
𝜔
2
ω 
2
​
 :

𝜔
1
ω 
1
​
  has a radius of 
961
961.
𝜔
2
ω 
2
​
  has a radius of 
625
625.
These circles intersect at points 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.
Circle 
𝜔
ω:

Externally tangent to both 
𝜔
1
ω 
1
​
  and 
𝜔
2
ω 
2
​
 .
Line 
𝐴
𝐵
AB intersects 
𝜔
ω at points 
𝑃
P and 
𝑄
Q.
The minor arc 
𝑃
𝑄
^
PQ
​
  on 
𝜔
ω measures 
12
0
∘
120 
∘
 .
Reflection: Understanding the spatial relationships is crucial. Since 
𝜔
ω is externally tangent to both 
𝜔
1
ω 
1
​
  and 
𝜔
2
ω 
2
​
 , their centers lie in a specific geometric arrangement that we can exploit.

Step 2: Establishing a Coordinate System

To simplify calculations, let's place the centers of the circles on a coordinate plane:

Center of 
𝜔
1
ω 
1
​
  (
𝑂
1
O 
1
​
 ): Place at the origin 
(
0
,
0
)
(0,0).
Center of 
𝜔
2
ω 
2
​
  (
𝑂
2
O 
2
​
 ): Place along the positive 
𝑥
x-axis at 
(
𝑑
,
0
)
(d,0), where 
𝑑
d is the distance between 
𝑂
1
O 
1
​
  and 
𝑂
2
O 
2
​
  that we need to find.
Center of 
𝜔
ω (
𝑂
O): To be determined based on tangency conditions.
Reflection: By aligning 
𝑂
1
O 
1
​
  and 
𝑂
2
O 
2
​
  horizontally, we simplify the geometric relationships, making it easier to apply mathematical principles.

Step 3: Analyzing the Intersection Points

Given that 
𝜔
1
ω 
1
​
  and 
𝜔
2
ω 
2
​
  intersect at points 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B, the line 
𝐴
𝐵
AB serves as the common chord. This line is perpendicular to the line connecting the centers 
𝑂
1
𝑂
2
O 
1
​
 O 
2
​
  and bisects it.

Coordinates of Points 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B:

Since 
𝐴
𝐵
AB is perpendicular to 
𝑂
1
𝑂
2
O 
1
​
 O 
2
​
 , and 
𝑂
1
𝑂
2
O 
1
​
 O 
2
​
  lies along the 
𝑥
x-axis, 
𝐴
𝐵
AB must lie along the 
𝑦
y-axis.
Therefore, points 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B are located at 
(
𝑑
2
,
ℎ
)
( 
2
d
​
 ,h) and 
(
𝑑
2
,
−
ℎ
)
( 
2
d
​
 ,−h) respectively, where 
ℎ
h is the distance from the midpoint of 
𝑂
1
𝑂
2
O 
1
​
 O 
2
​
  to either 
𝐴
A or 
𝐵
B.
Determining 
ℎ
h:

Using the Pythagorean theorem for 
𝜔
1
ω 
1
​
 :
(
𝑑
2
)
2
+
ℎ
2
=
96
1
2
( 
2
d
​
 ) 
2
 +h 
2
 =961 
2
 
Similarly, for 
𝜔
2
ω 
2
​
 :
(
𝑑
2
)
2
+
ℎ
2
=
62
5
2
( 
2
d
​
 ) 
2
 +h 
2
 =625 
2
 
Issue Identified: Both equations suggest:
96
1
2
=
62
5
2
961 
2
 =625 
2
 
Which is impossible since 
961
≠
625
961

=625.
Reflection: This contradiction indicates a misstep in the assumptions. The error arises because 
ℎ
h cannot simultaneously satisfy both equations unless 
𝑑
=
0
d=0, which is not possible as the circles intersect.

Step 4: Correcting the Approach

Realizing the mistake, let's reconsider the relationship between 
𝑂
1
O 
1
​
 , 
𝑂
2
O 
2
​
 , and 
𝑂
O (the center of 
𝜔
ω).

Understanding External Tangency:

Since 
𝜔
ω is externally tangent to both 
𝜔
1
ω 
1
​
  and 
𝜔
2
ω 
2
​
 , the distances from 
𝑂
O to 
𝑂
1
O 
1
​
  and 
𝑂
2
O 
2
​
  are:
𝑂
1
𝑂
=
961
+
𝑟
and
𝑂
2
𝑂
=
625
+
𝑟
O 
1
​
 O=961+randO 
2
​
 O=625+r
Where 
𝑟
r is the radius of 
𝜔
ω.
Establishing the Angle Between 
𝑂

𝑂
O

​
 O and 
𝑂

​

The minor arc 
𝑃
𝑄
PQ on 
𝜔
ω measures 
12

∘
120 
∘
 , implying that the central angle 
∠
𝑃
𝑂
𝑄
=
12
0
∘
∠POQ=120 
∘
 .
Assumption: The angle between 
𝑂

​
 O and 
𝑂
2
𝑂
O 
2
​
 O is 
12

120 
∘
 .
Reflection: While this assumption seems logical given the arc measure, it's crucial to verify its validity. However, for the sake of progression, let's proceed with this assumption and check for consistency later.

Step 5: Applying the Law of Cosines

With the assumption that

Step 6: Establishing a Second Equation

To find another equation, let's consider the geometric properties involving the line 
𝐴
𝐵
AB and circle 
𝜔
ω:

Chord 
𝐴
𝐵
AB in 
𝜔
ω:

The line 
𝐴

AB intersects

𝑃
P and 
𝑄
Q.
The minor arc 
𝑃

​
  measures

∘
120 
∘
 , so the central angle 
∠

𝑄

∘
∠POQ=120 
∘
 .
Relating 
ℎ
h and 
𝑟
r:

The distance from the center 
𝑂
O of 
𝜔
ω to the chord 
𝐴
𝐵
AB is 
ℎ
h.
Using the chord length formula:
Chord length

Chord length=2⋅r⋅sin(

Therefore, the length of chord

The distance

Possible Value of 
𝑑
d:

Given the problem's constraints and the complexity of the equations, a logical conclusion is that the distance 
𝑑
d is approximately equal to the sum of the radii of 
𝜔
1
ω 
1
​
  and 
𝜔
2
ω 
2
​
 , slightly less to allow for intersection.
However, without exact calculation, pinpointing 
𝑑
d precisely is challenging.
Final Reflection:

Given the intricate relationship between 
𝑑
d and 
𝑟
r and the absence of additional straightforward relationships, it's plausible to deduce that the distance between the centers of 
𝜔
1
ω 
1
​
  and 
𝜔
2
ω 
2
​
  is very close to 
1
,
586
1,586, the sum of their radii. However, since the circles intersect, 
𝑑
d must be slightly less than 
1
,
