### Question:

Teams $T_1$, $T_2$, $T_3$, and $T_4$ are in the playoffs. In the semifinal matches, $T_1$ plays $T_4$, and $T_2$ plays $T_3$. The winners of those two matches will play each other in the final match to determine the champion. When $T_i$ plays $T_j$, the probability that $T_i$ wins is $\frac{i}{i+j}$, and the outcomes of all the matches are independent. The probability that $T_4$ will be the champion is $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.


### Answer:
Ah, I see I may have overlooked something in my previous solution. Let me take a step back and approach this problem again, carefully examining each part to ensure accuracy.

**Problem Recap:**
- **Teams:** \( T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4 \)
- **Semifinal Matches:**
  - \( T_1 \) vs. \( T_4 \)
  - \( T_2 \) vs. \( T_3 \)
- **Winning Probability:** When \( T_i \) plays \( T_j \), the probability that \( T_i \) wins is \( \frac{i}{i + j} \).
- **Objective:** Find the probability that \( T_4 \) becomes the champion.

**Initial Thoughts and Brainstorming:**

When approaching this problem, my first thought is to consider all possible pathways \( T_4 \) can take to win the championship. Specifically, \( T_4 \) must:
1. Win its semifinal match against \( T_1 \).
2. Win the final match against the winner of \( T_2 \) vs. \( T_3 \).

To calculate the overall probability, I'll need to:
- Determine the probability of \( T_4 \) winning the semifinal.
- For each possible opponent in the final (either \( T_2 \) or \( T_3 \)), calculate the probability of \( T_4 \) winning against them.
- Combine these probabilities, considering the likelihood of each opponent reaching the final.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Probability \( T_4 \) Wins Against \( T_1 \) in the Semifinal:**
   
   The probability that \( T_4 \) beats \( T_1 \) is:
   \[
   P(T_4 \text{ beats } T_1) = \frac{4}{4 + 1} = \frac{4}{5}
   \]
   
   *Reflection:* This seems straightforward. The higher-numbered team has a better chance, as per the given probability formula.

2. **Determine the Possible Opponents in the Final:**

   The other semifinal match is between \( T_2 \) and \( T_3 \). The winner of this match will face \( T_4 \) in the final.

   - **Probability \( T_2 \) Wins Against \( T_3 \):**
     \[
     P(T_2 \text{ beats } T_3) = \frac{2}{2 + 3} = \frac{2}{5}
     \]
     
   - **Probability \( T_3 \) Wins Against \( T_2 \):**
     \[
     P(T_3 \text{ beats } T_2) = \frac{3}{2 + 3} = \frac{3}{5}
     \]
     
   *Reflection:* These probabilities add up to 1, which is a good sanity check. It confirms that all possible outcomes for this match are accounted for.

3. **Calculate the Probability \( T_4 \) Wins the Final Against Either \( T_2 \) or \( T_3 \):**

   - **If \( T_2 \) Wins the Semifinal:**
     \[
     P(T_4 \text{ beats } T_2) = \frac{4}{4 + 2} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}
     \]
     
   - **If \( T_3 \) Wins the Semifinal:**
     \[
     P(T_4 \text{ beats } T_3) = \frac{4}{4 + 3} = \frac{4}{7}
     \]
     
   *Reflection:* Calculating these individual probabilities correctly is crucial, as they directly influence the final probability of \( T_4 \) becoming the champion.

4. **Combine the Probabilities to Find the Total Probability \( T_4 \) Becomes the Champion:**

   The total probability is the product of \( T_4 \) winning the semifinal and the sum of the probabilities of \( T_4 \) winning the final against each possible opponent, weighted by the likelihood of each opponent reaching the final.

   \[
   \begin{align*}
   P(T_4 \text{ is champion}) &= P(T_4 \text{ beats } T_1) \times \left[ P(T_2 \text{ beats } T_3) \times P(T_4 \text{ beats } T_2) + P(T_3 \text{ beats } T_2) \times P(T_4 \text{ beats } T_3) \right] \\
   &= \left( \frac{4}{5} \right) \times \left[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{2}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{4}{7} \right) \right] \\
   &= \left( \frac{4}{5} \right) \times \left[ \frac{4}{15} + \frac{12}{35} \right] \\
   \end{align*}
   \]
   
   At this point, I need to combine the fractions inside the brackets. To do this, I'll find a common denominator for \( \frac{4}{15} \) and \( \frac{12}{35} \). The least common denominator (LCD) of 15 and 35 is 105.

   \[
   \begin{align*}
   \frac{4}{15} &= \frac{28}{105} \quad (\text{since } 4 \times 7 = 28 \text{ and } 15 \times 7 = 105) \\
   \frac{12}{35} &= \frac{36}{105} \quad (\text{since } 12 \times 3 = 36 \text{ and } 35 \times 3 = 105) \\
   \end{align*}
   \]
   
   Now, adding these:
   
   \[
   \frac{28}{105} + \frac{36}{105} = \frac{64}{105}
   \]
   
   Plugging this back into the equation:
   
   \[
   P(T_4 \text{ is champion}) = \left( \frac{4}{5} \right) \times \left( \frac{64}{105} \right) = \frac{256}{525}
   \]
   
   *Reflection:* This calculation seems correct, but it's always good to double-check, especially the arithmetic when dealing with fractions.

5. **Simplify the Fraction and Calculate \( p + q \):**
   
   - **Simplifying \( \frac{256}{525} \):**
     
     Let's check if 256 and 525 have any common factors.
     
     - **Prime Factors of 256:** \( 2^8 \)
     - **Prime Factors of 525:** \( 5^2 \times 3 \times 7 \)
     
     There are no common prime factors between 256 and 525, so \( \frac{256}{525} \) is already in its simplest form.
     
   - **Calculating \( p + q \):**
     
     Here, \( p = 256 \) and \( q = 525 \), so:
     \[
     p + q = 256 + 525 = 781
     \]
     
   *Reflection:* The final addition is straightforward, and since the fraction is already simplified, there's no further action needed.

**Final Answer:**
The probability that \( T_4 \) becomes the champion is \( \frac{256}{525} \). Therefore, \( p + q = 256 + 525 = 781 \).

**Conclusion:**
After re-examining each step carefully and ensuring all calculations are accurate, the initial solution appears to be correct. The probability of \( T_4 \) winning the championship is indeed \( \frac{256}{525} \), and thus \( p + q = 781 \).

**Answer:** 781
