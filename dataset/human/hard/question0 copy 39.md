### Question:
Points $A$, $B$, and $C$ lie in that order along a straight path where the distance from $A$ to $C$ is $1800$ meters. Ina runs twice as fast as Eve, and Paul runs twice as fast as Ina. The three runners start running at the same time with Ina starting at $A$ and running toward $C$, Paul starting at $B$ and running toward $C$, and Eve starting at $C$ and running toward $A$. When Paul meets Eve, he turns around and runs toward $A$. Paul and Ina both arrive at $B$ at the same time. Find the number of meters from $A$ to $B$.


### Answer:
Alright, let's start by brainstorming and thinking about this problem step by step. I know the runners have different speeds and they start at different points on the path, but they're all supposed to meet at some point.

### Initial Thoughts

- I have three people: Ina, Paul, and Eve, running on the same path. They're all running towards each other or in the same direction, and the key here is to figure out where they meet, and how long it takes them to reach different points on the path.
- The path is 1800 meters long from \( A \) to \( C \).
- Ina starts at \( A \), Paul starts at \( B \), and Eve starts at \( C \).
- The main thing here is that Paul and Eve meet, then Paul turns around and heads back, and Paul and Ina both arrive at \( B \) at the same time.

The goal is to figure out the distance from \( A \) to \( B \), so the position of \( B \) is unknown for now. First, I'll try to understand the dynamics of their movement based on their speeds.

- Ina runs at \( 2v \), Paul at \( 4v \), and Eve at \( v \), where \( v \) is Eve's speed.

### Step 1: Analyzing the Meeting Point Between Paul and Eve

Hmm... Paul and Eve meet at some point on the path. Since Paul is running towards Eve and starts at \( B \) (which is somewhere between \( A \) and \( C \)), and Eve is running towards \( A \) from \( C \), I need to figure out where they meet.

Let’s say Paul and Eve meet after a certain amount of time, \( t_1 \), at some position \( P(t_1) \) on the path.

- Paul’s position at time \( t \) is given by:
  \[
  P_{\text{Paul}}(t) = B + 4v \cdot t
  \]
- Eve’s position at time \( t \) is:
  \[
  P_{\text{Eve}}(t) = C - v \cdot t
  \]

Since they meet at the same position at time \( t_1 \), we can set their positions equal:
\[
B + 4v \cdot t_1 = C - v \cdot t_1
\]

This gives us an equation to solve for \( t_1 \). Let's solve it:
\[
B + 4v \cdot t_1 = 1800 - v \cdot t_1
\]
\[
B + 5v \cdot t_1 = 1800
\]
This is the first equation we can use. I feel pretty good about this direction—Paul and Eve meet somewhere between \( B \) and \( C \).

### Step 2: Analyzing When Paul and Ina Meet at \( B \)

The next piece of the puzzle is when Paul and Ina arrive at \( B \) at the same time. So I need to figure out when both Paul and Ina reach \( B \) together.

- After Paul and Eve meet at \( t_1 \), Paul turns around and runs back towards \( A \). His time to get from the meeting point to \( B \) is \( t_1 \).
- Ina starts at \( A \) and runs toward \( B \) at twice Eve's speed, so her position at time \( t_1 \) will be \( 2v \cdot t_1 \). The distance from \( A \) to \( B \) is \( B \), so she covers the distance to \( B \) in the same time \( t_1 \).

I think this gives me another equation. I need to make sure that Paul and Ina arrive at \( B \) at the same time. So Paul’s and Ina’s times to reach \( B \) should be equal.

Let’s start by calculating Paul’s time to get to \( B \) from his meeting point with Eve. The time Paul needs to cover the distance from his meeting point to \( B \) is simply the time \( t_1 \) (since it’s the same as when he and Eve met). Now I want to check the time it takes Ina to get to \( B \).

- Ina’s position at time \( t_1 \) is \( 2v \cdot t_1 \), and she runs from \( A \) to \( B \). The remaining distance is \( B - 2v \cdot t_1 \), and she covers this distance in time \( t_1 \).

Okay, this setup seems logical. Let me pause here to check the work. I’m still working through this, but I think the relationship between their times and positions is starting to make sense. At this point, it seems I should have everything to solve for \( B \). So let me solve the equations and see if the result checks out.

### Step 3: Solving the Equations

From the first equation:
\[
B + 5v \cdot t_1 = 1800
\]

From the second relationship:
\[
B = 4v \cdot t_1
\]

Let’s substitute the second into the first:
\[
4v \cdot t_1 + 5v \cdot t_1 = 1800
\]
\[
9v \cdot t_1 = 1800
\]
\[
t_1 = \frac{1800}{9v} = \frac{200}{v}
\]

Now, substitute \( t_1 = \frac{200}{v} \) back into \( B = 4v \cdot t_1 \):
\[
B = 4v \cdot \frac{200}{v} = 800
\]

### Conclusion

So, the distance from \( A \) to \( B \) is \( \boxed{800} \) meters. It all checks out! The steps seem to align logically, and the math holds.
