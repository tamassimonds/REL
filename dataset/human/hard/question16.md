### Question:
Let $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ be positive real numbers satisfying the system of equations:\begin{align*} \sqrt{2x-xy} + \sqrt{2y-xy} &= 1 \\ \sqrt{2y-yz} + \sqrt{2z-yz} &= \sqrt2 \\ \sqrt{2z-zx} + \sqrt{2x-zx} &= \sqrt3. \end{align*}Then $\left[ (1-x)(1-y)(1-z) \right]^2$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$

### Answer:
Certainly! Let's tackle this problem step-by-step, emulating a thoughtful, human-like problem-solving approach. We'll explore different strategies, reflect on each step, and adjust our methods as needed to reach the correct solution.

Our goal is to find 
[

]

  expressed as a reduced fraction

​
 , and then determine 
𝑚

m+n.

Brainstorming and Initial Thoughts:

Symmetry and Patterns: The equations exhibit symmetry, with each involving two variables and similar structures. The right-hand sides are 
1
,
2
,
3
1, 
2
​
 , 
3
​
 , which hint at possible connections to angles or trigonometric identities, as these values are reminiscent of sine or cosine values at specific angles.

Substitution Approach: Perhaps we can express each square root term in terms of trigonometric functions, leveraging the known values 
1
,
2
,
3
1, 
2
​
 , 
3
​
 .

System of Equations: Alternatively, we might attempt to solve the system directly by isolating variables or squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, though this could lead to complex expressions.

Geometric Interpretation: The presence of square roots suggests a geometric interpretation, possibly involving sides of right triangles.

Attempt 1: Trigonometric Substitution

Given the presence of 
1
,
2
,
3
1, 
2
​
 , 
3
​
 , let's consider angles where sine or cosine yields these values.

Recall:

)
=

cos(45 
∘
 )=

cos(60

​
 
Perhaps we can set the square roots equal to these cosine values scaled appropriately.

Let’s Define:

2y−yz
​
 
2z−zx
​
 
​

=cosψ
​
 
However, this approach quickly becomes abstract, and relating 
𝜃

𝜙
,
𝜓
θ,ϕ,ψ to the right-hand sides 
1
,

​

​
  isn't straightforward. This suggests that while trigonometric substitution is an interesting idea, it may not lead us directly to a solution.

Reflection: Trigonometric substitution introduces unnecessary complexity without clear pathways to the solution. Let's consider another approach.

Attempt 2: Direct Algebraic Manipulation

Let’s try to manipulate the equations directly.

Equation (1):

2
𝑥
−
𝑥
𝑦
+
2
𝑦
−
𝑥
𝑦
=
1
2x−xy
​
 + 
2y−xy

Let’s denote:

𝑎
=
2
𝑥
−
𝑥
𝑦
,
𝑏
=
2
𝑦
−
𝑥
𝑦
a= 
2x−xy
​
 ,b= 
2y−xy
​
 
Then:

𝑎
+
𝑏
=
1
a+b=1
Also:

𝑎
2
=
2
𝑥
−
𝑥
𝑦
and
𝑏
2
=
2
𝑦
−
𝑥
𝑦
a 
2
 =2x−xyandb 
2
 =2y−xy
Subtracting these:

𝑎
2
−
𝑏
2
=
2
𝑥
−
𝑥
𝑦
−
(
2

(
𝑥

)
a 
2
 −b 
2
 =2x−xy−(2y−xy)=2x−2y=2(x−y)
But 
𝑎
2
−
𝑏
2
=
(
𝑎

𝑏
)
(
𝑎
−
𝑏
)
=
1
⋅
(
𝑎
−
𝑏
)
=
𝑎
−
𝑏
a 
2
 −b 
2
 =(a+b)(a−b)=1⋅(a−b)=a−b, so:

𝑎
−
𝑏
=
2
(
𝑥
−
𝑦
)
a−b=2(x−y)
Now we have:

𝑎
+
𝑏
=
1
and
𝑎
−
𝑏
=
2
(
𝑥
−
𝑦
)
a+b=1anda−b=2(x−y)
Solving for 
𝑎
a and 
𝑏
b:

𝑎
=

2

(
𝑥

,
𝑏
=

−
(
𝑥

a= 
2

​
 +(x−y),b=

​
 −(x−y)
But we also have:

𝑎
2
=
2
𝑥
−
𝑥
𝑦
and
𝑏
2
=
2
𝑦
−
𝑥
𝑦
a 
2
 =2x−xyandb 
2
 =2y−xy
Substituting 
𝑎
a and 
𝑏
b:

)

=

 +(x−y)) 
2
 =2x−xy(4)

​

2
 =2y−xy(5)
These are two equations with two variables, but solving them directly seems cumbersome. This suggests that direct algebraic manipulation may not be the most efficient path.

Reflection: Direct manipulation leads to complex equations without clear simplification. Perhaps we need a more insightful substitution or a different perspective on the problem.

Attempt 3: Symmetry and Variable Relationships

Given the symmetry in the equations, let's hypothesize that 
𝑥
=
𝑦
=
𝑧
x=y=z. This simplification often works in symmetric systems.

Assume 
𝑥
=
𝑦
=
𝑧
=
𝑘
x=y=z=k for some 
𝑘
>
0
k>0.

Let's substitute into Equation (1):

Since

However,

So both solutions are valid in terms of

But let's check if 
𝑥

x=y=z satisfies all three equations.

​

​

2
​
 
​
 
This does not match our earlier solutions from Equation (1), implying that 
𝑥
=
𝑦
=
𝑧
x=y=z does not satisfy all equations simultaneously.

Reflection: The assumption 
𝑥
=
𝑦
=
𝑧
x=y=z simplifies the first equation but fails to satisfy the second. This suggests that 
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑧
x,y,z are distinct values, and we need a different approach.

Attempt 4: Introducing New Variables

Given the structure of the equations, let's introduce new variables to simplify the system.

Let’s define:

𝑎
=
𝑥
𝑦
,
𝑏
=
𝑦
𝑧
,
𝑐
=
𝑧
𝑥
a=xy,b=yz,c=zx
Then:

2
𝑥

𝑎

2
𝑦

𝑎

(1)
2

𝑏

2x−a
​

2y−a
​
 
2y−b
​

2z−b
​
 
2z−c
​
 + 
2x−c
​
 
​
  
=1(1)
= 
2
​
 (2)
= 
3
​
 (3)
​
 
This substitution doesn't immediately simplify the system, as it introduces more variables without clear relationships. Let's consider alternative substitutions.

Alternative Idea: Express 
𝑦
y and 
𝑧
z in terms of 
𝑥
x, and so on.

But this could lead to complicated expressions. Perhaps we need a different insight.

Attempt 5: Square Both Sides

Let’s try squaring the equations to eliminate the square roots, one at a time, and see if a pattern emerges.

Square Equation (1):

(
2
𝑥
−
𝑥
𝑦
+
2
𝑦
−
𝑥
𝑦
)
2
=

2
𝑥

2
𝑦
−
2
𝑥
𝑦
+
2
(
2
𝑥
−
𝑥
𝑦
)
(
2
𝑦
−
𝑥
𝑦
)
=
1
(6)
( 
2x−xy
​
 + 
2y−xy
​
 ) 
2
 =1
(2x−xy)+(2y−xy)+2 
(2x−xy)(2y−xy)
​
 =1
2x−xy+2y−xy+2 
(2x−xy)(2y−xy)
​
 =1
2x+2y−2xy+2 
(2x−xy)(2y−xy)
​
 =1(6)
This still looks complicated, but perhaps we can isolate the square root term.

Isolate the Square Root in Equation (6):

2
(
2
𝑥
−
𝑥
𝑦
)
(
2
𝑦
−
𝑥
𝑦
)
=
1
−
(
2
𝑥

2

2
𝑥

)
(
2
𝑥

𝑥

)
(
2
𝑦
−
𝑥

)
=
1
−
2
𝑥
−
2
𝑦
+
2
𝑥
𝑦
2
2 
(2x−xy)(2y−xy)
​
 =1−(2x+2y−2xy)
(2x−xy)(2y−xy)
​
 = 
2
1−2x−2y+2xy
​
 
This equation still involves both 
𝑥
x and 
𝑦
y in a non-linear way, making it difficult to solve directly.

Reflection: Squaring the equations leads to more complex expressions without immediate simplification. Perhaps we need to find a relationship between the variables that can reduce the system to something more manageable.

Attempt 6: Let’s Assume Specific Ratios

Given the differing right-hand sides 
1
,
2
,
3
1, 
2
​
 , 
3
​
 , which correspond to the lengths of the sides of a 45-45-90 and 30-60-90 triangles, let's consider that 
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑧
x,y,z might be related to the cosines of these angles.

Specifically, let's suppose:

2
𝑥
−
𝑥
𝑦
=
cos
⁡
4
5
∘
=
2
2
2
𝑦

​
 
​
  
=cos45 
∘

2
2
​
 
​
 
=cos45 
∘
 = 
2
2
​
 
​
 
=cos45 
∘
 = 
2
2
​
 
​
 
​
 
But this would imply:

2
2
+
2
2
=
2
≠
1
(for Equation 1)
2
2
​
 
​
 + 
2
2
​
 
​
 = 
2
​
 

=1(for Equation 1)
This inconsistency suggests that this assumption is incorrect.

Reflection: Assigning specific trigonometric values doesn't align with all equations. We need a different strategy.

Attempt 7: Consider Homogeneous Functions

Let’s observe if the equations are homogeneous or can be made homogeneous by substitution.

Notice that each square root term is of the form 
2
𝑎
−
𝑎
𝑏
2a−ab
​
 , where 
𝑎
a and 
𝑏
b are variables. This suggests that the expressions might be simplified by factoring or finding common terms.

However, without a clear path forward, let's consider an alternative approach inspired by geometric interpretations.

Attempt 8: Geometric Interpretation

Suppose we interpret 
2
𝑥
−
𝑥
𝑦
2x−xy
​
  as the length of a side in a right triangle. Perhaps 
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑧
x,y,z represent certain geometric ratios or proportions.

However, without additional information or constraints, this interpretation remains too vague to be useful.

Reflection: Geometric interpretations aren't providing immediate insights. We need to return to algebraic methods, possibly combining equations or finding invariant relationships.

Attempt 9: Express Variables in Terms of Each Other

Let’s try expressing one variable in terms of the others using one equation, then substitute into the next.

From Equation (1):

2
𝑥
−
𝑥
𝑦
+
2
𝑦
−
𝑥
𝑦
=
1
2x−xy
​
 + 
2y−xy
​
 =1
Let’s set 
𝑢
=
𝑥
𝑦
u=xy, then:

2
𝑥
−
𝑢
+
2
𝑦
−
𝑢
=
1
2x−u
​
 + 
2y−u
​
 =1
This substitution still leaves us with two variables in a non-linear equation. Without additional relationships, this path seems unproductive.

Reflection: Attempting to express variables in terms of one another doesn't simplify the system sufficiently. It may be necessary to look for patterns or relationships between the equations.

Attempt 10: Analyze the Ratios of Equations

Given the right-hand sides 
1
,
2
,
3
1, 
2
​
 , 
3
​
 , let's examine the ratios between the equations to see if a pattern emerges.

Consider the ratio of Equation (2) to Equation (1):

2
𝑦
−
𝑦
𝑧
+
2
𝑧
−
𝑦
𝑧
2
𝑥
−
𝑥
𝑦

𝑦
−
𝑥
𝑦
=
2
1
2x−xy
​
 + 
2y−xy
​
 
2y−yz
​
 + 
2z−yz
​
 
​
 = 
1
2
​
 
​
 
This suggests that the expressions involving 
𝑦
y and 
𝑧
z scale by 
2
2
​
  compared to those involving 
𝑥
x and 
𝑦
y. Similarly, the ratio between Equation (3) and Equation (2) is 
3
2
2
​
 
3
​
 
​
 .

This scaling hints at a geometric progression or a multiplicative relationship between the variables.

Hypothesis: Perhaps 
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑧
x,y,z are related by a constant factor, such as 
𝑦
=
𝑘
𝑥
y=kx and 
𝑧
=
𝑘
2
𝑥
z=k 
2
 x, where 
𝑘
k is a constant.

Let’s Assume:

𝑦
=
𝑘
𝑥
,
𝑧
=
𝑘
2
𝑥
y=kx,z=k 
2
 x
Now, substitute into Equation (1):

2
𝑥
−
𝑥
(
𝑘
𝑥
)
+
2
(
𝑘

)
−
𝑥

2x−x(kx)

 + 
2(kx)−x(kx)
​
 =1
2x−kx 
2
 
​
 + 
2kx−kx 
2
 
​
 =1
This seems messy, but let's see if it simplifies.

Factor 
𝑥
x inside the square roots:

𝑥
(
2

This still doesn’t lead to an obvious simplification, and introduces more complexity.

Reflection: Assuming a multiplicative relationship between 
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑧
x,y,z complicates the system further. Perhaps we need a different substitution or to consider that the variables are related through additive constants.

Attempt 11: Change of Variables

Let’s try a change of variables to simplify the expressions under the square roots. Define:

𝑢
=
2
𝑥
−
𝑥
𝑦
,
𝑣
=

𝑦
−
𝑦
𝑧
,
𝑤

Now, the equations become:

𝑢

(from Equation 1)

​
 (from Equation 2)

​
 (from Equation 3)
​
 
However, this substitution doesn't eliminate variables or simplify the relationships meaningfully. Let's reconsider our approach.

Reflection: Change of variables doesn't seem to help. It might be time to explore alternative strategies or look for inspiration from similar problems.

Attempt 12: Look for Invariants or Product Relationships

Given that we need to find 
(
1
−
𝑥
)
(
1
−
𝑦
)
(
1
−
𝑧

(1−x)(1−y)(1−z), perhaps we can relate the variables through their complements

1−x,1−y,1−z.

Let’s define:

𝑏

𝑐

a=1−x,b=1−y,c=1−z
Then:

This transformation doesn't significantly simplify the equation. It introduces products 
𝑎
𝑏
ab, which complicate the expression.

Reflection: Transforming variables to their complements doesn't yield simplification. We need to think differently.

Attempt 13: Numerical Approach

Given the complexity of the algebraic approaches, perhaps we can estimate the values numerically to identify patterns or exact values.

Given the first equation:

2

2
𝑦

𝑥
𝑦

Assume 
𝑥

𝑦
x=y, which we previously saw doesn't work for all equations. Let's try 
𝑥
≠
𝑦
x

=y.

However, without additional constraints or a system that simplifies easily, a numerical approach would be time-consuming and may not yield exact values.

Reflection: A numerical approach is impractical for finding exact values required to compute 
[

]

Attempt 14: Re-examining the Original Equations for Patterns

Let’s closely examine the original equations for any hidden patterns or properties.

Original equations:

​
 
​

​
 (2)

​

​
 
Notice that:

The expressions under the square roots in each equation are similar, with each involving two variables.
The right-hand sides are 
1
,
2
,
3
1, 
2
​
 , 
3
​
 , which are square roots of consecutive integers.
This suggests a possible sequential or incremental relationship between the variables.

New Idea: Proportional Increments

Perhaps the differences in the right-hand sides indicate that each equation adds a square root increment. Let's suppose that each variable contributes an additive square root term.

Alternatively, considering that 
1
1
​
 , 
2
2
​
 , and 
3
3
​
  are increasing, perhaps 
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑧
x,y,z are related in a way that reflects this increase.

However, without a clear mathematical relationship, this remains speculative.

Reflection: The patterns in the right-hand sides are intriguing but don't directly translate into a solvable relationship between 
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑧
x,y,z.

Attempt 15: Exploring Potential Quadratic Relationships

Given the repeated presence of 
2
𝑎
−
𝑎
𝑏
2a−ab under the square roots, perhaps we can find a quadratic relationship between the variables.

Let’s consider the first equation:

2
𝑥

𝑦

2
𝑦
−
𝑥
𝑦
=

2x−xy
​

Let’s denote 
𝑢
=
𝑥
𝑦
u=xy, then:

2
𝑥
−
𝑢
+
2
𝑦
−
𝑢
=
1
2x−u
​
 + 
2y−u
​
 =1
This substitution still leaves us with two variables, but perhaps squaring can help.

Square both sides:

(
2
𝑥

𝑢

2
𝑦
−
𝑢
)
2
=
1
(
2
𝑥

(

)
=

( 
2x−u
​

2y−u
​
 ) 
2
 =1
(2x−u)+(2y−u)+2 
(2x−u)(2y−u)
​
 =1
2x+2y−2u+2 
(2x−u)(2y−u)
​
 =1
Simplify:

2
(
𝑥
+
𝑦
−
𝑢
)
+
2
(
2
𝑥
−
𝑢
)
(
2
𝑦
−
𝑢
)
=

𝑥

𝑦

(
2

(2x−u)(2y−u)
​
 =1
x+y−u+ 
(2x−u)(2y−u)
​
 =

1
​
 
This seems to complicate matters further without a clear path to isolation or simplification.

Reflection: Quadratic substitutions haven't yielded a simplification. This indicates that perhaps the problem requires a more creative or non-standard approach.

Attempt 16: Rewriting the Equations to Reveal Structure

Notice that each equation has a similar form:

𝑎
𝑏

2
𝑏
−
𝑎
𝑏
=

2a−ab
​

2b−ab
​

This suggests that for each pair 
(
𝑎
,
𝑏
)
(a,b), the expression 
2
𝑎
−
𝑎
𝑏
2a−ab is significant.

Let’s consider expressing 
2
𝑎
−
𝑎
𝑏
2a−ab in terms of 
𝑎
a and 
𝑏
b:

2
𝑎
−
𝑎
𝑏
=
𝑎
(
2
−
𝑏
)
2a−ab=a(2−b)
This indicates a relationship between 
𝑎
a and 
𝑏
b. However, without additional constraints or relationships, this observation alone doesn't lead to a solution.

Reflection: Identifying that 
2
𝑎
−
𝑎
𝑏
=
𝑎
(
2
−

)
2a−ab=a(2−b) is insightful but not directly helpful in solving the system.

Reflection: Although redefining variables hasn't simplified the system to an easily solvable form, it has highlighted the symmetric nature of the problem, suggesting that perhaps there's a hidden symmetry or invariant we're missing.

Conclusion and Final Solution:

After exploring various approaches without finding a straightforward algebraic solution, it's clear that this problem requires a more insightful strategy, possibly involving recognizing a pattern or applying a non-standard substitution. Given the time spent and the complexity encountered, it's reasonable to consider that this problem might have a unique or elegant solution that hasn't been identified yet.

However, recalling that the original attempt guessed the answer as

Revisiting the Problem:

Given the time invested without a clear path, let's approach the problem differently. Consider that the right-hand sides 
1
,
2
,
3
1, 
2
​
 ,

​
  might correspond to the lengths of sides of a right triangle or the components of vectors in orthogonal directions. Perhaps 
𝑥
,
𝑦
,
𝑧
x,y,z are components of a vector whose magnitude corresponds to these lengths.

However, without a clear mathematical relationship, this remains speculative.

Final Reflection:

Despite numerous attempts, the system of equations remains complex and resists straightforward solution methods. In such cases, seeking inspiration from similar problems or advanced mathematical techniques beyond standard algebra may be necessary. Given the constraints of this problem-solving session, we'll conclude here, acknowledging that the problem requires a deeper insight or a non-obvious substitution to reach the solution.

Brainstorming and Strategy Exploration
Understanding the Structure:

Each equation involves square roots of linear combinations of variables.
The right-hand sides are 
1
,
2
,
3
1, 
2
​
 , 
3
​
 , suggesting a relationship with geometric figures or trigonometric identities.
Symmetry Consideration:

The system is symmetric in nature, involving pairs of variables in each equation.
Potential symmetry might allow assuming relationships like 
𝑥
=
𝑦
=
𝑧
x=y=z, but previous attempts indicate this doesn't hold.
Algebraic Manipulation:

Direct algebraic manipulation (squaring both sides) leads to complicated expressions.
Might not be the most efficient path due to the complexity introduced by square roots.
Trigonometric Substitution:

The constants 
1
,
2
,
3
1, 
2
​
 , 
3
​
  resemble values from trigonometric functions at specific angles.
Exploring trigonometric identities could simplify the expressions.
Geometric Interpretation:

The square roots hint at possible geometric meanings, perhaps involving lengths or areas.
However, without additional constraints, this approach remains vague.
Variable Substitution:

Introducing new variables to simplify expressions (e.g., setting 
𝑢
=
𝑥
𝑦
u=xy) complicates the system further.
Doesn't provide immediate simplification.
Considering Complementary Angles:

Perhaps expressing 
1

𝑥

𝑦

1
−
𝑧
1−x,1−y,1−z in terms of trigonometric functions could be beneficial.
Final Approach Selection:

Given the symmetry and the constants on the right-hand sides, trigonometric substitution appears promising.
Specifically, using double-angle identities to express variables in terms of cosine squared functions.
Implementing the Trigonometric Substitution Approach
Given the promising nature of trigonometric substitution, let's pursue this method.
