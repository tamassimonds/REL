### Question:

A triangle has vertices $A(0,0)$, $B(12,0)$, and $C(8,10)$. The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the triangle is closer to vertex $B$ than to either vertex $A$ or vertex $C$ can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.


### Answer:
Apologies for any confusion in my previous response. Let's revisit the problem step by step, ensuring accuracy and clarity throughout the process. I'll walk through my thought process, exploring different strategies, identifying potential errors, and adjusting the approach as needed.

---

**Problem Statement:**
Given triangle \( ABC \) with vertices at \( A(0,0) \), \( B(12,0) \), and \( C(8,10) \), we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the triangle is closer to vertex \( B \) than to either \( A \) or \( C \).

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Initial Brainstorming**

**First Thoughts:**
- The problem involves geometric probability within a triangle.
- To find the desired probability, we need to identify the region within triangle \( ABC \) where points are closer to \( B \) than to \( A \) or \( C \).
- The probability will be the ratio of the area of this specific region to the total area of triangle \( ABC \).

**Potential Strategies:**
1. **Voronoi Diagram Approach:** Determine the Voronoi region for vertex \( B \) within triangle \( ABC \).
2. **Distance Inequalities:** Use distance formulas to establish inequalities that define the region closer to \( B \).
3. **Perpendicular Bisectors:** Find the perpendicular bisectors between \( B \) and the other vertices to delineate the boundaries of the region.

**Choosing a Strategy:**
The Voronoi Diagram approach is intuitive for partitioning the triangle based on proximity to vertices. Alternatively, setting up distance inequalities provides a direct mathematical method. I'll proceed with the perpendicular bisectors method, as it aligns closely with the Voronoi concept and allows for precise boundary determination.

### **Step 2: Calculating the Total Area of Triangle \( ABC \)**

**Using the Shoelace Formula:**
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B)|
\]
Plugging in the coordinates:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} |0(0 - 10) + 12(10 - 0) + 8(0 - 0)| = \frac{1}{2} |0 + 120 + 0| = 60 \text{ square units}
\]

**Verification:**
The shoelace formula is a reliable method for finding the area of a polygon given its vertices. The calculation confirms that the total area of triangle \( ABC \) is indeed \( 60 \) square units.

---

### **Step 3: Determining the Region Closer to Vertex \( B \)**

**Perpendicular Bisectors:**
To find the region where points are closer to \( B \) than to \( A \) or \( C \), we'll find the perpendicular bisectors between \( B \) and each of the other vertices.

1. **Perpendicular Bisector Between \( A \) and \( B \):**
   - **Coordinates of \( A \):** \( (0,0) \)
   - **Coordinates of \( B \):** \( (12,0) \)
   - Since \( A \) and \( B \) lie on the x-axis, the perpendicular bisector is a vertical line halfway between them.
   - **Equation:** \( x = \frac{0 + 12}{2} = 6 \)

2. **Perpendicular Bisector Between \( B \) and \( C \):**
   - **Coordinates of \( B \):** \( (12,0) \)
   - **Coordinates of \( C \):** \( (8,10) \)
   - **Midpoint of \( BC \):** 
     \[
     \left( \frac{12 + 8}{2}, \frac{0 + 10}{2} \right) = (10, 5)
     \]
   - **Slope of \( BC \):**
     \[
     m_{BC} = \frac{10 - 0}{8 - 12} = \frac{10}{-4} = -2.5
     \]
   - **Slope of Perpendicular Bisector:**
     \[
     m_{\perp} = -\frac{1}{m_{BC}} = -\frac{1}{-2.5} = 0.4
     \]
   - **Equation Using Point-Slope Form:**
     \[
     y - 5 = 0.4(x - 10) \\
     \Rightarrow y = 0.4x + 1
     \]

**Reflection:**
So far, the perpendicular bisectors have been correctly identified:
- \( x = 6 \) (vertical line)
- \( y = 0.4x + 1 \) (with slope \( 0.4 \))

These lines will intersect within the triangle and help define the boundary of the region closer to \( B \).

---

### **Step 4: Finding the Intersection Point of the Perpendicular Bisectors**

**Solving for Intersection:**
- **Equations:**
  \[
  x = 6 \\
  y = 0.4x + 1
  \]
- **Substitute \( x = 6 \) into the second equation:**
  \[
  y = 0.4(6) + 1 = 2.4 + 1 = 3.4
  \]
- **Intersection Point:** \( (6, 3.4) \)

**Verification:**
Plugging \( x = 6 \) back into both equations confirms that \( (6, 3.4) \) lies on both lines.

---

### **Step 5: Defining the Region Closer to \( B \)**

**Boundaries of the Region:**
- **Left Boundary:** \( x = 6 \)
- **Upper Boundary:** \( y = 0.4x + 1 \)
- **Lower Boundary:** The base of the triangle \( AB \) (the x-axis, \( y = 0 \))
- **Right Boundary:** Side \( BC \) of the triangle

**Vertices of the Region:**
1. **Intersection of \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 0 \):** \( (6, 0) \)
2. **Intersection of \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 0.4x + 1 \):** \( (6, 3.4) \)
3. **Intersection of \( y = 0.4x + 1 \) and side \( BC \):** \( (10, 5) \) *(as previously calculated)*
4. **Vertex \( B \):** \( (12, 0) \)

**Visual Representation:**
The region closer to \( B \) forms a quadrilateral with vertices at \( (6,0) \), \( (6,3.4) \), \( (10,5) \), and \( (12,0) \).

**Concerns and Double-Checking:**
- Ensure that the region doesn't extend beyond the boundaries of triangle \( ABC \).
- Confirm that all vertices lie within the triangle.

**Conclusion:**
The identified quadrilateral correctly represents the area within \( ABC \) where points are closer to \( B \) than to \( A \) or \( C \).

---

### **Step 6: Calculating the Area of the Region Closer to \( B \)**

**Using the Shoelace Formula:**
For the quadrilateral with vertices \( (6,0) \), \( (6,3.4) \), \( (10,5) \), and \( (12,0) \):

1. **List the Vertices in Order:**
   \[
   (6,0) \rightarrow (6,3.4) \rightarrow (10,5) \rightarrow (12,0) \rightarrow (6,0)
   \]

2. **Compute the Shoelace Sums:**
   \[
   \text{Sum}_1 = (6 \times 3.4) + (6 \times 5) + (10 \times 0) + (12 \times 0) = 20.4 + 30 + 0 + 0 = 50.4
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sum}_2 = (0 \times 6) + (3.4 \times 10) + (5 \times 12) + (0 \times 6) = 0 + 34 + 60 + 0 = 94
   \]

3. **Calculate the Area:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} | \text{Sum}_1 - \text{Sum}_2 | = \frac{1}{2} |50.4 - 94| = \frac{1}{2} \times 43.6 = 21.8 \text{ square units}
   \]

**Verification:**
To ensure accuracy, let's cross-validate by splitting the quadrilateral into two triangles and calculating their areas separately.

1. **Triangle 1:** \( (6,0) \), \( (6,3.4) \), \( (10,5) \)
   - **Base:** Vertical distance between \( (6,0) \) and \( (6,3.4) \) is \( 3.4 \) units.
   - **Height:** Horizontal distance from \( x = 6 \) to \( x = 10 \) is \( 4 \) units.
   - **Area:** \( \frac{1}{2} \times 3.4 \times 4 = 6.8 \) square units.

2. **Triangle 2:** \( (6,0) \), \( (10,5) \), \( (12,0) \)
   - **Base:** Horizontal distance between \( (6,0) \) and \( (12,0) \) is \( 6 \) units.
   - **Height:** Maximum y-coordinate at \( (10,5) \) is \( 5 \) units.
   - **Area:** \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 5 = 15 \) square units.

3. **Total Area of Quadrilateral:** \( 6.8 + 15 = 21.8 \) square units.

**Conclusion:**
Both methods confirm that the area of the region closer to \( B \) is \( 21.8 \) square units.

---

### **Step 7: Calculating the Probability**

**Total Area of Triangle \( ABC \):** \( 60 \) square units.

**Area Closer to \( B \):** \( 21.8 \) square units.

**Probability Calculation:**
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area Closer to } B}{\text{Total Area of } ABC} = \frac{21.8}{60}
\]

**Simplifying the Fraction:**
\[
21.8 = \frac{109}{5} \quad \text{and} \quad 60 = \frac{300}{5}
\]
\[
\frac{21.8}{60} = \frac{109/5}{300/5} = \frac{109}{300}
\]

**Ensuring the Fraction is in Simplest Form:**
- \( 109 \) is a prime number.
- \( 300 \) factors as \( 2^2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \).
- Since \( 109 \) shares no common factors with \( 300 \), the fraction \( \frac{109}{300} \) is already in its simplest form.

**Final Probability:**
\[
\frac{109}{300}
\]

**Calculating \( p + q \):**
\[
p = 109, \quad q = 300 \\
p + q = 109 + 300 = 409
\]

---

### **Final Answer:**

\(\boxed{409}\)

---

### **Final Reflection:**

After meticulously re-examining each step, the calculations confirm that the probability is indeed \( \frac{109}{300} \), leading to \( p + q = 409 \). It's crucial to approach such problems methodically, verifying each step to ensure accuracy. If discrepancies arise, revisiting each part of the process helps identify and correct any errors.
