### Question:
For $n\ge1$ call a finite sequence $(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)$ of positive integers progressive if $a_i<a_{i+1}$ and $a_i$ divides $a_{i+1}$ for $1\le i\le n-1$. Find the number of progressive sequences such that the sum of the terms in the sequence is equal to $360.$


### Answer:
Alright, let's tackle this problem together. I'll walk you through my thought process step by step, including the brainstorming, any dead ends I encounter, and how I adjust my approach along the way.

**Problem Statement:**
For \( n \geq 1 \), a finite sequence \( (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) \) of positive integers is called *progressive* if \( a_i < a_{i+1} \) and \( a_i \) divides \( a_{i+1} \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq n-1 \). We need to find the number of progressive sequences such that the sum of the terms in the sequence is equal to 360.

**First Thoughts:**
Okay, so we’re dealing with sequences of positive integers where each term divides the next one and is strictly increasing. The sum of these terms should be exactly 360. My initial thoughts are:

1. Since each term divides the next, the sequence is built by multiplying by some integer factor greater than or equal to 2.
2. The problem seems related to the factorization of 360, considering the divisibility condition.
3. The length of the sequence \( n \) can vary, starting from 1 upwards, as long as the sum condition is met.

But I'm not entirely sure yet how to count all possible such sequences. Let me brainstorm some strategies.

**Brainstorming Strategies:**

1. **Factorization Approach:** Since each term divides the next, perhaps the sequence can be represented in terms of the prime factors of 360.

2. **Recursive Construction:** Start building sequences from smaller sums and see how they can be extended.

3. **Generating Functions:** Use generating functions to encode the sequences and extract the coefficient corresponding to 360.

4. **Divisor Counting:** Since each term divides the next, maybe the number of sequences relates to the number of divisors of 360.

**Exploring the Factorization Approach:**
Let’s see what 360 looks like in terms of its prime factors:

\( 360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \).

Now, considering the divisibility condition \( a_i \mid a_{i+1} \) and \( a_i < a_{i+1} \), each subsequent term must be a multiple of the previous one, but strictly larger.

This seems a bit abstract. Maybe I need to think differently.

**Exploring Divisor Counting:**
If I list out all the positive divisors of 360, perhaps each divisor can serve as a starting point for a sequence.

First, find all divisors of 360:

\( 360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \).

The number of positive divisors is \( (3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24 \).

So, there are 24 positive divisors of 360.

Wait a minute—does this mean that the number of progressive sequences is equal to the number of positive divisors of 360? That seems too straightforward. Let me think about this.

**Testing the Hypothesis:**
If I consider each divisor of 360 as the first term \( a_1 \), can I build a unique progressive sequence from it?

For example:
- If \( a_1 = 1 \), then the sequence could be \( 1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots \), but it needs to sum to 360.
- If \( a_1 = 2 \), then the sequence starts with 2, and each next term is a multiple of 2.

But how do I ensure that the sum of the sequence equals 360? It seems like simply counting the divisors might not directly account for the sum condition.

**Reevaluating the Approach:**
Perhaps the initial idea that the number of sequences equals the number of divisors is incomplete. Maybe there’s a relationship, but it's not direct. Let's think differently.

**Alternative Approach: Scaling the Sequence:**
Suppose I take the first term \( a_1 \). Then, each subsequent term \( a_{i+1} \) is \( k_i \times a_i \), where \( k_i \geq 2 \) (since \( a_{i+1} > a_i \) and divides it).

Let’s denote \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_{n-1} \) as the multipliers between consecutive terms. Then the sequence can be represented as:
\[ a_1, a_1 k_1, a_1 k_1 k_2, \ldots, a_1 k_1 k_2 \cdots k_{n-1} \]

The sum of the sequence is:
\[ a_1 + a_1 k_1 + a_1 k_1 k_2 + \ldots + a_1 k_1 k_2 \cdots k_{n-1} = 360 \]

Factoring out \( a_1 \), we get:
\[ a_1 \left(1 + k_1 + k_1 k_2 + \ldots + k_1 k_2 \cdots k_{n-1} \right) = 360 \]

Let’s denote \( S = 1 + k_1 + k_1 k_2 + \ldots + k_1 k_2 \cdots k_{n-1} \). So, \( a_1 \times S = 360 \).

This means \( a_1 \) must be a divisor of 360, and \( S \) must be the corresponding quotient \( \frac{360}{a_1} \).

**Analyzing \( S \):**
Given that \( S = 1 + k_1 + k_1 k_2 + \ldots + k_1 k_2 \cdots k_{n-1} \), and each \( k_i \geq 2 \), what can we say about \( S \)?

- The minimum value of \( S \) occurs when all \( k_i = 2 \), leading to \( S = 1 + 2 + 4 + \ldots + 2^{n-1} } \), which is a geometric series sum of \( 2^{n} - 1 \).

This suggests that for each possible \( a_1 \), there is a corresponding \( S \) that must satisfy certain conditions. Specifically, \( S \) must be an integer greater than or equal to \( 2^{n} - 1 \).

**Connecting Back to Divisors:**
Since \( a_1 \) is a divisor of 360, and \( S = \frac{360}{a_1} \), we need to find all possible combinations where \( S \) can be expressed as \( 1 + k_1 + k_1 k_2 + \ldots + k_1 k_2 \cdots k_{n-1} \) with \( k_i \geq 2 \).

This seems quite abstract. Perhaps there's a pattern or a property that simplifies this.

**Revisiting Divisor Counting:**
Wait, earlier I found that 360 has 24 positive divisors. Could it be that each divisor corresponds to exactly one progressive sequence?

Let me test this with small examples.

**Testing with Smaller Numbers:**
Let's take a smaller number, say 6, and see how many progressive sequences sum to 6.

Divisors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6.

Possible progressive sequences:

1. \( (6) \) – sum is 6.
2. \( (1, 2, 3) \) – sum is 6.
3. \( (1, 5) \) – sum is 6, but 1 divides 5.
4. \( (2, 4) \) – sum is 6, but 2 does not divide 4 (wait, 2 divides 4).
   
Wait, actually, 2 does divide 4. So sequences are:

1. \( (6) \)
2. \( (1, 2, 3) \)
3. \( (1, 5) \)
4. \( (2, 4) \)

That's 4 sequences, matching the number of divisors of 6 (which is 4). Interesting!

**Hypothesis Confirmation:**
In this small case, the number of progressive sequences equals the number of positive divisors. This suggests that perhaps the same holds for 360.

**Conclusion:**
Based on this pattern and the reasoning above, it seems that for each positive divisor of 360, there is exactly one progressive sequence that sums to 360.

Since 360 has 24 positive divisors, the number of progressive sequences is **24**.

**Final Answer:** 24
