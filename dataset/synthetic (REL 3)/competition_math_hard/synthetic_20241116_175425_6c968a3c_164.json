    "working_out": "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this problem step-by-step, just like I would if I were tackling it myself.\n\n### **First Thoughts**\n\nWhen I first see this question about the trapezoid, a few things pop into my mind:\n\n1. **Understanding the Trapezoid**: Okay, so we have a trapezoid with two bases\u2014one is twice the height, and the other is three times the height. The height is given as \\(x\\).\n\n2. **Area Formula**: I remember that the area of a trapezoid is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{Base}_1 + \\text{Base}_2) \\times \\text{Height}\n   \\]\n   So, I need to express both bases in terms of \\(x\\) and then plug them into this formula.\n\n3. **Expressing Bases in Terms of Height**: \n   - Base 1 is twice the height: \\( \\text{Base}_1 = 2x \\)\n   - Base 2 is three times the height: \\( \\text{Base}_2 = 3x \\)\n\n4. **Setting Up the Problem**: With both bases expressed in terms of \\(x\\), I should be able to substitute them into the area formula.\n\n### **Exploring Different Strategies**\n\nBefore jumping in, let's brainstorm if there are other ways to approach this:\n\n- **Strategy 1**: Use the standard area formula for trapezoids by substituting the lengths of the bases and height.\n  \n- **Strategy 2**: Maybe visualize the trapezoid and break it down into simpler shapes (like rectangles and triangles) to double-check the area calculation.\n\n- **Strategy 3**: Consider using a numerical example with specific values for \\(x\\) to verify the algebraic result.\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards **Strategy 1**, as it directly applies the formula. If things seem off later, I might try Strategy 2 or 3 as a cross-check.\n\n### **Step 1: Identifying Base Lengths**\n\nLet's start by defining the lengths of the bases:\n\n- **Base 1**: Twice the height, so:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Base}_1 = 2x\n  \\]\n- **Base 2**: Three times the height, so:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Base}_2 = 3x\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection**: This seems straightforward. The problem clearly states the relationships, so I think this part is solid.\n\n### **Step 2: Substituting into the Area Formula**\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the trapezoid area formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{Base}_1 + \\text{Base}_2) \\times \\text{Height}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( \\text{Base}_1 \\) and \\( \\text{Base}_2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (2x + 3x) \\times x\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process**: Adding \\(2x\\) and \\(3x\\) is straightforward\u2014it's \\(5x\\). So, let's simplify further.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5x \\times x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{5}{2} x^2\n\\]\n\n### **Step 3: Checking the Calculations**\n\nLet's quickly verify if this makes sense:\n\n- **Numerical Example**: Suppose the height \\(x = 2\\):\n  - Base 1 = \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n  - Base 2 = \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\)\n  - Area = \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times (4 + 6) \\times 2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 2 = 10\\)\n\n- **Using Our Expression**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\frac{5}{2} \\times (2)^2 = \\frac{5}{2} \\times 4 = 10\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection**: Both methods yield the same area. This gives me confidence that the algebraic approach is correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Alternative Approach\u2014Breaking Down the Trapezoid**\n\nEven though our first strategy worked, let's consider another method to ensure accuracy:\n\n- **Strategy 2**: Visualize the trapezoid and see if dividing it into simpler shapes helps.\n\n**Thought Process**: Maybe drawing the trapezoid and seeing if splitting it into a rectangle and two triangles helps in understanding the area better.\n\n**Implementing Strategy 2**:\n\n1. **Draw the Trapezoid**: Label the bases and height.\n2. **Identify Components**: \n   - The height \\(x\\) is the same for both bases.\n   - The difference in lengths between the two bases is \\(3x - 2x = x\\).\n3. **Divide into Shapes**: \n   - Imagine a rectangle with width equal to the shorter base and height \\(x\\).\n   - Two triangles on either side with base \\(x\\) and height \\(x\\).\n\n**Calculating Areas**:\n\n- **Rectangle**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area}_{\\text{rectangle}} = \\text{Base}_1 \\times x = 2x \\times x = 2x^2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Two Triangles**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area}_{\\text{triangles}} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Base}_{\\text{difference}} \\times \\text{Height} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times x \\times x = x^2\n  \\]\n  \n- **Total Area**: \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\text{Area}_{\\text{rectangle}} + \\text{Area}_{\\text{triangles}} = 2x^2 + x^2 = 3x^2\n  \\]\n  \n**Reflection**: Wait, this gives us \\(3x^2\\), which is different from our earlier expression. I must have miscalculated somewhere in the alternative approach.\n\n**Checking the Alternative Approach**:\n\n- **Mistake Identification**: Let's see where the error occurred.\n  \n  - **Base Difference**: The difference should be divided by 2 because each triangle has only half the difference as its base, but in our calculation, it's been handled incorrectly.\n\n- **Correcting the Calculation**:\n  \n  - **Recalculating Triangles**:\n    \n    \\[\n    \\text{Area}_{\\text{triangles}} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{x}{2} \\times x = \\frac{1}{2} \\times x \\times x = \\frac{1}{2} x^2\n    \\]\n    \n  - **Total Area**:\n    \n    \\[\n    \\text{Area} = \\text{Area}_{\\text{rectangle}} + \\text{Area}_{\\text{triangles}} = 2x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} x^2 = \\frac{5}{2} x^2\n    \\]\n    \n**Reflection**: After correcting the calculation, both strategies yield the same result: \\(\\frac{5}{2} x^2\\). This consistency adds confidence to our solution.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore wrapping up, let's ensure everything aligns:\n\n- **Base Lengths**: Defined correctly.\n  \n- **Area Formula**: Applied correctly.\n\n- **Calculation Steps**: Simplified accurately.\n\n- **Alternative Approach**: Corrected and verified to match the primary approach.\n\n**Question**: Does everything make sense? \n\n- Yes, both methods lead to the same area expression \\(\\frac{5}{2} x^2\\), validating the solution's correctness.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter exploring different strategies, verifying calculations, and cross-checking with an alternative approach, the area of the trapezoid is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2} x^2}\n\\]\n\nI approached the problem by first understanding the relationships between the bases and height, applying the trapezoid area formula, and then verifying the solution through an alternative method. This step-by-step reflection and checking ensured the accuracy of the final expression.",
