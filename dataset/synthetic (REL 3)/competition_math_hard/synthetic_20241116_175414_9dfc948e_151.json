    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll brainstorm different strategies, explore their effectiveness, and continuously check my work to ensure I'm on the right track. Let's tackle the problem step by step, reflecting and adjusting our approach as needed.\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\nWhen I first see the question, **\"Rationalize the denominator of \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2}}\\)\"**,** I think:\n\n- **Rationalizing Denominators:** This reminds me of rationalizing denominators with square roots, which is a common technique. But wait, this involves **cube roots**, not square roots, so the methods might differ.\n  \n- **Conjugate Multiplication:** One strategy that pops into my mind is to multiply the numerator and denominator by the **conjugate** of the denominator. However, with cube roots, I'm not entirely sure how the conjugate works here compared to square roots.\n\n- **Expanding Cubes:** Another thought is to use the **difference of cubes** formula since the denominator has two cube roots. This might simplify things by leveraging the algebraic identities I know.\n\n- **Checking Similar Problems:** I recall tackling similar problems involving cube roots in the past, where using the difference of cubes was effective. But I need to ensure that approach applies here.\n\nHmm, I think starting with the **conjugate multiplication** idea makes sense, just to see where it leads. If it gets messy or doesn't seem right, I can switch to the **difference of cubes** method.\n\n### **Step 1: Attempting Conjugate Multiplication**\n\nLet's try multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The denominator is \\(\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2}\\), so the conjugate should be \\(\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3\\cdot2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2}\\). \n\n**But wait**, I'm not entirely comfortable with this approach because I recall that with cube roots, just multiplying by the conjugate doesn't always simplify nicely like it does with square roots. Maybe it's better to go with the cube root identity instead.\n\n**Reflection:** So, the conjugate method doesn't seem straightforward for cube roots. Let's shift to the **difference of cubes** approach, which is more suitable for this scenario.\n\n### **Step 2: Revisiting the Difference of Cubes Approach**\n\nI remember that the difference of cubes formula is:\n\n\\[\na^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)\n\\]\n\nLooking at our denominator, \\(\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2}\\), **maybe I can set this up using the difference of cubes identity**. \n\nLet me define:\n\n\\[\na = \\sqrt[3]{3} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = \\sqrt[3]{2}\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\na^3 = 3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b^3 = 2\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\na^3 - b^3 = 3 - 2 = 1\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that:\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2})(\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot 2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2}) = 1\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** By multiplying by \\(\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot 2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2}\\), I'll eliminate the cube roots in the denominator by leveraging the difference of cubes identity.\n\n**Realization:** This seems promising because it mirrors the algebraic identity I know.\n\n### **Step 3: Multiplying by the Correct Expression**\n\nLet's multiply both numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot 2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 \\cdot (\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot 2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2})}{(\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2})(\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot 2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2})}\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify the denominator first:\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2})(\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot 2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2}) = \\sqrt[3]{3}^3 - \\left(\\sqrt[3]{2}\\right)^3 = 3 - 2 = 1\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:** Wait, that simplifies to 1! That's perfect because it means the denominator becomes 1, leaving the numerator as is.\n\n**Check:** So, the denominator simplifies to 1, making the fraction equal to the numerator itself. This is neat and confirms that the approach is correct.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Expression**\n\nPutting it all together, the rationalized form of the original expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{3^2} + \\sqrt[3]{3 \\cdot 2} + \\sqrt[3]{2^2}}{1} = \\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{6} + \\sqrt[3]{4}\n\\]\n\n**Thought Process:** I see that by using the difference of cubes identity, I've successfully rationalized the denominator. The denominator became 1, simplifying the fraction significantly.\n\n**Reflection:** This method worked smoothly, unlike the initial attempt with the conjugate, which didn't seem straightforward. It's always good to explore different strategies and adapt as needed.\n\n### **Step 5: Identifying \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\)**\n\nNow, comparing the rationalized expression \\(\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{6} + \\sqrt[3]{4}}{1}\\) with \\(\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{A} + \\sqrt[3]{B} + \\sqrt[3]{C}}{D}\\), we can identify:\n\n\\[\nA = 9, \\quad B = 6, \\quad C = 4, \\quad D = 1\n\\]\n\n### **Step 6: Calculating \\(A + B + C + D\\)**\n\nLet's compute the sum:\n\n\\[\nA + B + C + D = 9 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 20\n\\]\n\n**Check:** The numbers seem small and manageable, and adding them up confirms the correctness.\n\n### **Final Check**\n\nBefore concluding, let me briefly verify:\n\n- **Does the rationalization make sense?** Yes, multiplying by the difference of cubes expression simplified the denominator to 1.\n  \n- **Is the final expression correct?** Yes, \\(\\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{6} + \\sqrt[3]{4}\\) makes sense as the rationalized form.\n\n- **Is the calculation of \\(A + B + C + D\\) correct?** Yes, adding the identified values gives 20.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy exploring different strategies, I found that using the **difference of cubes** identity was the most effective approach for rationalizing the denominator involving cube roots. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Brainstormed**: Considered conjugate multiplication and difference of cubes.\n2. **Attempted**: Started with conjugate multiplication but realized it wasn't straightforward.\n3. **Revisited**: Shifted to the difference of cubes approach.\n4. **Executed**: Multiplied by the appropriate expression, simplifying the denominator to 1.\n5. **Identified Constants**: Determined \\(A = 9\\), \\(B = 6\\), \\(C = 4\\), \\(D = 1\\).\n6. **Calculated Sum**: \\(A + B + C + D = 20\\).\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]\n\nThis approach ensured a clear and correct path to the solution, reflecting on each step and checking for correctness throughout the process.",

Letting $a = \\sqrt[3]{3}$ and $b = \\sqrt[3]{2}$, we have \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{3} - \\sqrt[3]{2}} \\cdot \\frac{(\\sqrt[3]{3})^2 + \\sqrt[3]{3} \\sqrt[3]{2} + (\\sqrt[3]{2})^2}{(\\sqrt[3]{3})^2 + \\sqrt[3]{3} \\sqrt[3]{2} + (\\sqrt[3]{2})^2}.\n\\]The denominator simplifies by the above identity to $(\\sqrt[3]{3})^3 - (\\sqrt[3]{2})^3 = 1$, so we are left with $\\sqrt[3]{9} + \\sqrt[3]{6} + \\sqrt[3]{4}$.
