    "working_out": "Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'll walk through my thought process just like I would if I were solving it on paper, brainstorming different strategies, reflecting, and checking my work along the way. Let's start with understanding the question.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\n**First Thoughts:**\nThe problem asks for the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that:\n- \\( n^2 \\) is divisible by 18\n- \\( n^3 \\) is divisible by 640\n\nHmm, I remember dealing with divisibility problems like this before. It often involves prime factorization or looking at divisibility rules. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the only way. Let me brainstorm a bit.\n\n**Brainstorming:**\n- **Prime Factorization:** This seems like a natural starting point. Breaking down 18 and 640 into their prime factors might help me see the smallest \\( n \\) that satisfies both conditions.\n- **Testing Small Numbers:** Another approach could be to test small integers to see if they meet both conditions. This might be time-consuming but could serve as a check.\n- **Using Exponents:** Maybe I can use properties of exponents to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the exponents needed for each condition.\n\nI'm leaning towards starting with prime factorization because it gives a clear mathematical pathway. If that gets messy, I can switch to testing small numbers as a backup.\n\n**Reflection:**\nLet\u2019s try prime factorization first. If it doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019ll reconsider my approach.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Prime Factorization of 18 and 640**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nOkay, let's break down 18 and 640 into their prime factors.\n\n- **18:**  \n  - \\( 18 = 2 \\times 9 \\)  \n  - \\( 9 = 3 \\times 3 \\)  \n  - So, \\( 18 = 2^1 \\times 3^2 \\)\n\n- **640:**  \n  - \\( 640 = 64 \\times 10 \\)  \n  - \\( 64 = 2^6 \\)  \n  - \\( 10 = 2 \\times 5 \\)  \n  - So, \\( 640 = 2^7 \\times 5^1 \\)\n\n**Checking:**\nWait, let me make sure I did this right.\n\n- For 18:  \n  \\( 2 \\times 9 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\), yep, correct.\n\n- For 640:  \n  \\( 64 = 2^6 \\), and \\( 10 = 2 \\times 5 \\), so combining, \\( 2^6 \\times 2^1 \\times 5 = 2^7 \\times 5^1 \\), correct.\n\n**Reflection:**\nLooks good so far. Now, I need to figure out what \\( n^2 \\) and \\( n^3 \\) must be in terms of prime factors.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing the Conditions for \\( n^2 \\) and \\( n^3 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nFor \\( n^2 \\) to be divisible by 18 (\\( 2^1 \\times 3^2 \\)):\n- \\( n^2 \\) must include at least one 2 and two 3s.\n\nFor \\( n^3 \\) to be divisible by 640 (\\( 2^7 \\times 5^1 \\)):\n- \\( n^3 \\) must include at least seven 2s and one 5.\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, I need to find the smallest \\( n \\) that satisfies both conditions. It sounds like I need to find the least exponent for each prime factor across both conditions.\n\nLet\u2019s think about exponents in \\( n \\):\n\n- If \\( n = 2^a \\times 3^b \\times 5^c \\), then:\n  - \\( n^2 = 2^{2a} \\times 3^{2b} \\times 5^{2c} \\)\n  - \\( n^3 = 2^{3a} \\times 3^{3b} \\times 5^{3c} \\)\n\nSo, for **\\( n^2 \\):**\n- \\( 2^{2a} \\geq 2^1 \\) \u2192 \\( 2a \\geq 1 \\) \u2192 \\( a \\geq 0.5 \\)\n- \\( 3^{2b} \\geq 3^2 \\) \u2192 \\( 2b \\geq 2 \\) \u2192 \\( b \\geq 1 \\)\n- \\( 5^{2c} \\geq 5^0 \\) \u2192 \\( 2c \\geq 0 \\) \u2192 \\( c \\geq 0 \\)\n\nFor **\\( n^3 \\):**\n- \\( 2^{3a} \\geq 2^7 \\) \u2192 \\( 3a \\geq 7 \\) \u2192 \\( a \\geq \\frac{7}{3} \\approx 2.33 \\)\n- \\( 3^{3b} \\geq 3^0 \\) \u2192 \\( 3b \\geq 0 \\) \u2192 \\( b \\geq 0 \\)\n- \\( 5^{3c} \\geq 5^1 \\) \u2192 \\( 3c \\geq 1 \\) \u2192 \\( c \\geq \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\nWait, I can\u2019t have fractional exponents in \\( n \\) because \\( n \\) must be an integer. This means I need to round up to the nearest whole number.\n\n- For \\( a \\): Needs to be at least 2 (since \\( \\frac{7}{3} \\) rounds up)\n- For \\( b \\): Must be at least 1\n- For \\( c \\): Must be at least 1 (since \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) rounds up)\n\n**Checking:**\nLet\u2019s see if these exponents satisfy both conditions.\n\n- **\\( n^2 \\):**\n  - \\( 2^{2 \\times 2} = 2^4 \\) (satisfied \\( 2^1 \\))\n  - \\( 3^{2 \\times 1} = 3^2 \\) (satisfied \\( 3^2 \\))\n  - \\( 5^{2 \\times 1} = 5^2 \\) (satisfied \\( 5^0 \\))\n\n- **\\( n^3 \\):**\n  - \\( 2^{3 \\times 2} = 2^6 \\) (needs \\( 2^7 \\) but only \\( 2^6 \\), so not sufficient)\n  - \\( 3^{3 \\times 1} = 3^3 \\) (satisfied \\( 3^0 \\))\n  - \\( 5^{3 \\times 1} = 5^3 \\) (satisfied \\( 5^1 \\))\n\n**Reflection:**\nHmm, seems like the exponent for 2 in \\( n^3 \\) isn\u2019t high enough. This means I need to increase \\( a \\) and see if it still satisfies \\( n^2 \\)'s condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Adjusting Exponents to Meet Both Conditions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nI need to find the smallest integer exponents \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\) such that:\n- \\( 2^{2a} \\geq 2^1 \\) and \\( 2^{3a} \\geq 2^7 \\)\n- \\( 3^{2b} \\geq 3^2 \\) and \\( 3^{3b} \\geq 3^0 \\)\n- \\( 5^{2c} \\geq 5^0 \\) and \\( 5^{3c} \\geq 5^1 \\)\n\nLet\u2019s solve each one separately.\n\n**For 2:**\n- \\( 2a \\geq 1 \\) \u2192 \\( a \\geq 0.5 \\) \u2192 Must be at least 1\n- \\( 3a \\geq 7 \\) \u2192 \\( a \\geq \\frac{7}{3} \\approx 2.33 \\) \u2192 Must be at least 3\n\nSo, \\( a = 3 \\).\n\n**For 3:**\n- \\( 2b \\geq 2 \\) \u2192 \\( b \\geq 1 \\)\n- \\( 3b \\geq 0 \\) \u2192 \\( b \\geq 0 \\)\n\nSo, \\( b = 1 \\).\n\n**For 5:**\n- \\( 2c \\geq 0 \\) \u2192 \\( c \\geq 0 \\)\n- \\( 3c \\geq 1 \\) \u2192 \\( c \\geq \\frac{1}{3} \\) \u2192 Must be at least 1\n\nSo, \\( c = 1 \\).\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis seems to work. Now, let\u2019s see what \\( n \\) would be with these exponents.\n\n**Calculating \\( n \\):**\n\\[ n = 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 8 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 120 \\]\n\n**Checking:**\nLet\u2019s verify if \\( n = 120 \\) meets both conditions.\n\n- **\\( n^2 \\):**\n  \\[ n^2 = 120^2 = 14400 \\]\n  \\[ 14400 \\div 18 = 800 \\] (divisible)\n\n- **\\( n^3 \\):**\n  \\[ n^3 = 120^3 = 1728000 \\]\n  \\[ 1728000 \\div 640 = 2700 \\] (divisible)\n\n**Reflection:**\nBoth conditions are satisfied with \\( n = 120 \\). It looks like this approach worked well.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Double-Checking the Solution**\n\n**Thought Process:**\nIt's always good to double-check, especially since I adjusted exponents to fit both conditions. Let's ensure that \\( n = 120 \\) is indeed the smallest possible integer that satisfies both.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Testing Smaller Numbers**\n\nMaybe I should test smaller multiples of the prime factors to see if there's a smaller \\( n \\) that still meets both conditions.\n\n**Testing:**\nLet\u2019s consider \\( n = 60 \\).\n\n- **\\( n^2 = 60^2 = 3600 \\)**\n  \\[ 3600 \\div 18 = 200 \\] (divisible)\n\n- **\\( n^3 = 60^3 = 216000 \\)**\n  \\[ 216000 \\div 640 = 337.5 \\] (not divisible)\n\n**Reflection:**\nOh, so \\( n = 60 \\) doesn\u2019t satisfy the second condition. This means \\( n = 120 \\) is indeed the smallest integer that meets both.\n\n**Alternative Approach: Least Common Multiple (LCM) of Requirements**\n\nCould I have approached this by finding the LCM of the required exponents for each prime factor? Let\u2019s see.\n\n**For each prime:**\n- **2:** Needs \\( 2^3 \\) (from \\( n^3 \\))\n- **3:** Needs \\( 3^1 \\) (from both \\( n^2 \\) and \\( n^3 \\))\n- **5:** Needs \\( 5^1 \\) (from \\( n^3 \\))\n\nSo, the smallest \\( n \\) would be:\n\\[ n = 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 120 \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\nThis confirms our earlier calculation. Using LCM simplifies the process and ensures we meet all requirements with the smallest \\( n \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThrough prime factorization and careful examination of the required exponents for each condition, we determined that the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( n^2 \\) is divisible by 18 and \\( n^3 \\) is divisible by 640 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]\n\nThis step-by-step approach, including brainstorming, checking, and reflecting, ensured that we arrived at the correct and minimal solution.",

  "ground_truth": "Note firstly that $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$, so $n$ must be divisible by both $2$ and $3$. Furthermore, $640 = 2^7 \\cdot 5$, so $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$ and $5$, since the smallest power of 2 that, when cubed, is no smaller than $2^7$ is $2^3$. Therefore, $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$, $3$, and $5$. Note that $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 120$ is the smallest possible integer that satisfies all of these conditions, so we have $n = \\boxed{120}$."
