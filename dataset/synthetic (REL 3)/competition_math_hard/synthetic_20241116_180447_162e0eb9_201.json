I'll write out my thoughts, including any confusion or dead ends, and continuously reflect on whether I'm on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### **First Thoughts and Brainstorming**\n\n**User Query:**  \nFind the product of all real values of \\( r \\) for which \\( \\frac{1}{2x} = \\frac{r - x}{7} \\) has exactly one real solution.\n\n**Initial Reaction:**  \nOkay, this looks like an equation involving \\( x \\) and \\( r \\). I remember dealing with equations where the number of solutions relates to the parameters involved\u2014maybe something with quadratics or conditions for having a single solution?\n\n**Possible Strategies:**\n1. **Rearrange the Equation:** Try to get everything in standard form and see if it resembles a quadratic equation.\n2. **Analyze as a Linear Equation in \\( x \\):** Since both sides are fractions, maybe clearing the denominators would help.\n3. **Check Conditions for Single Solution:** Perhaps the discriminant (if it ends up being quadratic) is zero for exactly one solution.\n4. **Graphical Approach:** Maybe thinking about the graphs of the two sides to see where they intersect could illuminate the situation.\n\n**Exploring the First Strategy:**  \nLet me try rearranging the equation to see what it looks like.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Clear the Fractions**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nClearing fractions is often a good first step. It simplifies the equation and makes it easier to analyze.\n\n**Action:**  \nMultiply both sides by \\( 14x \\) (the least common multiple of the denominators \\( 2x \\) and \\( 7 \\)) to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n14x \\cdot \\frac{1}{2x} = 14x \\cdot \\frac{r - x}{7}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n7 = 2x(r - x)\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThis simplifies nicely to a quadratic equation in terms of \\( x \\). Let\u2019s see what it looks like.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Reorganize the Equation**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, let's expand and rearrange it to standard quadratic form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n\n**Action:**  \nExpand the right side:\n\n\\[\n7 = 2xr - 2x^2\n\\]\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 2xr + 7 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**  \nDivide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - xr + \\frac{7}{2} = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nLooks like a standard quadratic equation. Quadratics have specific conditions for the number of real solutions based on the discriminant. This might be a useful path to explore.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Discriminant Condition**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nFor a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), the discriminant \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\) determines the number of real solutions:\n- If \\( \\Delta > 0 \\), there are two distinct real solutions.\n- If \\( \\Delta = 0 \\), there is exactly one real solution.\n- If \\( \\Delta < 0 \\), there are no real solutions.\n\n**Action:**  \nIdentify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) from the equation:\n\n\\[\na = 1, \\quad b = -r, \\quad c = \\frac{7}{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-r)^2 - 4(1)\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) = r^2 - 14\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nFor the equation to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero:\n\n\\[\nr^2 - 14 = 0\n\\]\n\n--- \n\n### **Step 4: Solve for \\( r \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nNow, let's solve the equation \\( r^2 - 14 = 0 \\) to find the values of \\( r \\) that make the discriminant zero.\n\n**Action:**  \nSet up the equation:\n\n\\[\nr^2 = 14\n\\]\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nr = \\pm \\sqrt{14}\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{14} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad r = -\\sqrt{14}\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nSo, the values of \\( r \\) that make the discriminant zero are \\( \\sqrt{14} \\) and \\( -\\sqrt{14} \\). These are the points where the original equation \\( \\frac{1}{2x} = \\frac{r - x}{7} \\) has exactly one real solution for \\( x \\).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Find the Product of All Real Values of \\( r \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nThe question asks for the product of all real values of \\( r \\) that satisfy the condition. We found two such values: \\( \\sqrt{14} \\) and \\( -\\sqrt{14} \\). Multiplying them together should give the required product.\n\n**Action:**  \nCalculate the product:\n\n\\[\nr_1 \\times r_2 = \\sqrt{14} \\times (-\\sqrt{14}) = -(\\sqrt{14})^2 = -14\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\nr_1 \\times r_2 = -14\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nThe product of \\( \\sqrt{14} \\) and \\( -\\sqrt{14} \\) is indeed \\( -14 \\). This makes sense because the product of two numbers whose squares are equal but oppositely signed is negative.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Quick Verification**\n\n**Thought Process:**  \nIt's always good to double-check the work to ensure everything is correct. Let\u2019s see if the values of \\( r \\) make the original equation have exactly one real solution.\n\n**Action:**  \nPlug \\( r = \\sqrt{14} \\) and \\( r = -\\sqrt{14} \\) back into the discriminant condition.\n\nFor \\( r = \\sqrt{14} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (\\sqrt{14})^2 - 14 = 14 - 14 = 0\n\\]\n\nFor \\( r = -\\sqrt{14} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\Delta = (-\\sqrt{14})^2 - 14 = 14 - 14 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**  \nBoth values of \\( r \\) indeed result in a discriminant of zero, confirming that the original equation has exactly one real solution for each. This reassures that our approach and calculations are correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nBy clearing the fractions, transforming the equation into a standard quadratic form, and applying the discriminant condition, I was able to determine that the values of \\( r \\) for which the equation has exactly one real solution are \\( \\sqrt{14} \\) and \\( -\\sqrt{14} \\). Their product is \\( -14 \\).\n\nThroughout the process, I brainstormed different strategies, checked each step for correctness, and reflected on whether the approach was leading me in the right direction. This step-by-step, reflective thinking ensured accuracy in finding the solution.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n  \nThe product of all real values of \\( r \\) for which \\( \\frac{1}{2x} = \\frac{r - x}{7} \\) has exactly one real solution is **\\(-14\\)**.",

  "ground_truth": "Observe first that $x=0$ is not a solution to the equation since it makes the denominator of $\\frac{1}{2x}$ equal to 0.  For $x\\neq 0$, we may multiply both sides by both denominators and move all the resulting terms to the left-hand side to get $2x^2-2rx+7=0$. Observe that there are two ways the original equation could have exactly one solution.  Either $2x^2-2rx+7=0$ has two solutions and one of them is 0, or else $2x^2-2rx+7=0$ has exactly one nonzero solution.  By trying $x=0$, we rule out the first possibility.\n\nConsidering the expression $\\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the solutions of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we find that there is exactly one solution if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is zero.  Setting $(-2r)^2-4(2)(7)$ equal to 0 gives $4r^2-4(14) = 0$.  Add 4(14) and divide by 4 to find $r^2=14$.  The two solutions of this equation are $\\sqrt{14}$ and $-\\sqrt{14}$, and their product is $\\boxed{-14}$."
