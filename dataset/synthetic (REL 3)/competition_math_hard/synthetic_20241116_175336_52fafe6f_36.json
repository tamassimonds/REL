    "working_out": "Absolutely, let's tackle this problem by thinking through it step-by-step, just as a human would. I'll start by brainstorming different strategies, reflecting on each approach, checking my work frequently, and adjusting my methods as needed. Let's dive in!\n\n### **First Thoughts: Understanding the Question**\n\nWhen I first see the problem:\n\n> **What is the coefficient of \\( a^2b^2 \\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\)?**\n\n- **Initial Reaction:** This looks like a combinatorial problem involving binomial expansions. I remember dealing with coefficients in binomials before, so that\u2019s a starting point.\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  1. **Binomial Theorem:** Use it to expand \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\) separately.\n  2. **Multinomial Coefficients:** Since we have two expressions multiplied, maybe thinking in terms of multinomial coefficients could help.\n  3. **Identifying Required Terms:** Focus on extracting \\( a^2 b^2 \\) specifically and see how it interacts with \\( c \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{c} \\).\n\nAt this moment, I feel the **Binomial Theorem** approach might be the most straightforward for handling each part independently. Let's start there and see if it leads us in the right direction.\n\n### **Step 1: Expanding \\( (a + b)^4 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- I recall the **Binomial Theorem** states that \\( (x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k \\).\n- Here, \\( x = a \\), \\( y = b \\), and \\( n = 4 \\).\n- We need the coefficient of \\( a^2 b^2 \\), which means \\( n-k = 2 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\binom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 + \\binom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 + \\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 + \\binom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 + \\binom{4}{4} a^0 b^4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3 b + 6 \\cdot a^2 b^2 + 4 \\cdot a b^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Coefficient of \\( a^2 b^2 \\):** I see it's \\( 6 \\). That makes sense because \\( \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\).\n- **Check:** Does this look correct? Yes, expanding each term seems accurate.\n\n### **Step 2: Expanding \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\)**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Apply the **Binomial Theorem** again.\n- This time, \\( x = c \\) and \\( y = \\frac{1}{c} \\), with \\( n = 6 \\).\n- Need to consider terms that will combine with \\( a^2 b^2 \\) to form \\( a^2 b^2 c^m \\) where \\( m \\) is determined by balancing the powers.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{j} c^{6-j} \\left( \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^j\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{j} c^{6-2j}\n\\]\n\n**Finding the Required Coefficients:**\n\n- **Objective:** Combine with \\( a^2 b^2 \\) to form \\( a^2 b^2 c^m \\) with \\( m \\geq 0 \\).\n- **Constraints:** Since we're looking for the overall coefficient of \\( a^2 b^2 \\), we need the \\( c \\) terms to multiply out without affecting the \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) coefficients.\n\n**Identifying Relevant Terms:**\n\n- To neutralize \\( c \\), we need \\( c^{6-2j} \\) to be \\( c^0 \\).\n- This happens when \\( 6 - 2j = 0 \\) \u21d2 \\( j = 3 \\).\n\n**Calculating the Coefficient for \\( j = 3 \\):**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient} = \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does this make sense?** Yes, selecting \\( j = 3 \\) balances the powers of \\( c \\), leaving no \\( c \\) in the final expression.\n- **Check:** \\( \\binom{6}{3} = 20 \\), which aligns with the expectation.\n\n### **Step 3: Combining the Two Expansions**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- Now, we need to multiply the coefficients from both expansions to get the total coefficient for \\( a^2 b^2 c^m \\).\n- Specifically, since \\( c \\) terms are neutralized, the overall coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\).\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Coefficient} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Checking the result:** Does multiplying 6 (from \\( a^2 b^2 \\)) and 20 (from \\( c^{0} \\)) yield a reasonable answer? Yes, 120 seems plausible.\n- **Rechecking:** Everything aligns; the steps logically flow from one to the next.\n\n### **Step 4: Verifying the Approach**\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- **Is this the only way?** While the Binomial Theorem worked well, could there be another method?\n- **Alternative:** Consider using Multinomial Coefficients since we\u2019re dealing with two products. But looking back, the Binomial approach was straightforward.\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does it need changing?** Not really; the method worked as intended.\n- **Final Check:** Re-evaluating each step confirms the correctness of the approach and the answer.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter carefully expanding both parts using the Binomial Theorem, identifying the necessary coefficients, and verifying each step, the coefficient of \\( a^2 b^2 \\) in \\( (a + b)^4 \\left( c + \\frac{1}{c} \\right)^6 \\) is **120**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Reflection:**\n\n- **Thinking Process:** By brainstorming initial strategies, choosing the Binomial Theorem, and methodically checking each step, I ensured accuracy.\n- **Mistakes or Insights:** Initially, considering Multinomial Coefficients seemed tempting but unnecessary. Stick with what works.\n- **Approach Validity:** Regular checks confirmed each step's correctness, leading to a reliable final answer.\n\nThis step-by-step thinking, including reflections and check-ins, mimics human problem-solving, ensuring a thorough and accurate solution.",

  "ground_truth": "To find the coefficient of $a^2b^2$ in $(a+b)^4\\left(c+\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6$, we need to find the coefficient of $a^2b^2$ in $(a+b)^4$ and the constant term of $\\left(c+\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6$. Using the Binomial Theorem, we find that these are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ and $\\binom{6}{3}=20$. The coefficient of $a^2b^2$ in $(a+b)^4\\left(c+\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6$ is the product of these, or $\\boxed{120}$."
