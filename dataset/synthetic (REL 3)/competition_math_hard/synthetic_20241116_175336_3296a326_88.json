We need to find the intersection points of two parabolas given by their equations:\n\n1. \\( y = 2x^2 - 7x + 1 \\)\n2. \\( y = 8x^2 + 5x + 1 \\)\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\n- **Equating the Two Equations:** Wait, parabolas intersect where their \\(y\\)-values are equal for the same \\(x\\)-value. So, maybe setting the two equations equal to each other would be a good starting point.\n\n- **Looks Like Solving a Quadratic:** This reminds me of solving quadratic equations. We\u2019ll likely end up with a quadratic equation after setting them equal. Hmm, I\u2019ve done something like this before, but I need to be careful with coefficients and signs.\n\n- **Possible Strategies:**\n  - **Set Equations Equal:** As mentioned, set them equal to find \\(x\\)-coordinates.\n  - **Graphical Approach:** Maybe sketching the parabolas could help visualize the intersections, but that won't give me precise answers.\n  - **Using Quadratic Formula:** Once I have a quadratic equation, use the quadratic formula to find \\(x\\)-values.\n  - **Completing the Square:** An alternative to the quadratic formula that might simplify things.\n  \n**Wait, I might need to double-check which method is more straightforward. But for now, let's try setting them equal and see where it leads.**\n\n### Step 1: Set the Equations Equal to Each Other\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nOkay, to find the points of intersection, the \\(y\\)-values must be the same. So, let's set the right-hand sides of the equations equal:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 7x + 1 = 8x^2 + 5x + 1\n\\]\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nSubtract all terms on the right from the left to bring everything to one side:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 - 7x + 1 - 8x^2 - 5x - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this step by step:\n\n- \\(2x^2 - 8x^2 = -6x^2\\)\n- \\(-7x - 5x = -12x\\)\n- \\(1 - 1 = 0\\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n-6x^2 - 12x = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nHmm, there are no constant terms left. The equation looks cleaner now. But wait\u2014let me check if I made any mistakes in my subtraction:\n\n- Original equation: \\(2x^2 - 7x + 1\\)\n- Subtracting \\(8x^2 + 5x + 1\\):\n  - \\(2x^2 - 8x^2 = -6x^2\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - \\(-7x - 5x = -12x\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n  - \\(1 - 1 = 0\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNo mistakes here. **The equation seems correct.**\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Quadratic Equation\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nI've got the quadratic equation \\( -6x^2 - 12x = 0 \\). To solve for \\(x\\), I can factor it out. But let me think\u2014maybe factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) would make it easier.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nFirst, factor out the GCF from the equation:\n\n\\[\n-6x^2 - 12x = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\(-6x\\):\n\n\\[\n-6x(x + 2) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, by factoring out \\(-6x\\), I've simplified the equation. **This should make solving for \\(x\\) easier.** But am I sure I factored out the GCF correctly?\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n\n- GCF of \\(-6x^2\\) and \\(-12x\\) is indeed \\(-6x\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n\n**Everything looks good. Time to solve for \\(x\\).**\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\(x\\)\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow, set each factor equal to zero to find the \\(x\\)-coordinates of the intersection points:\n\n\\[\n-6x = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving these:\n\n1. \\( -6x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0 \\)\n2. \\( x + 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -2 \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOkay, I have two possible \\(x\\)-values: \\(0\\) and \\(-2\\). **Let me quickly check if these make sense within the context.**\n\n- Both solutions are real numbers, so they should be valid since parabolas can intersect at real points.\n\n- If I plug these back into either original equation, they should yield the same \\(y\\)-value, confirming the intersections.\n\n**It seems like I\u2019m on the right track. Let\u2019s proceed to find the corresponding \\(y\\)-values.**\n\n### Step 4: Find Corresponding \\(y\\)-Values\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have the \\(x\\)-coordinates, I need to find the corresponding \\(y\\)-coordinates by plugging \\(x\\) back into either of the original equations. Let\u2019s use the first equation for simplicity.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- For \\(x = 0\\):\n  \\[\n  y = 2(0)^2 - 7(0) + 1 = 1\n  \\]\n  \n- For \\(x = -2\\):\n  \\[\n  y = 2(-2)^2 - 7(-2) + 1 = 2(4) + 14 + 1 = 8 + 14 + 1 = 23\n  \\]\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nWait, let me double-check these calculations:\n\n- For \\(x = 0\\):\n  \\[\n  y = 2(0)^2 - 7(0) + 1 = 1 \\quad \u2714\ufe0f\n  \\]\n  \n- For \\(x = -2\\):\n  \\[\n  y = 2(4) + 14 + 1 = 8 + 14 + 1 = 23 \\quad \u2714\ufe0f\n  \\]\n\n**Both \\(y\\)-values seem correct.** \n\n### Step 5: List Intersection Points\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nNow that I have both \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-coordinates, I can list the points of intersection. But remember, the question asks for them in order of increasing \\(x\\)-coordinate.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- First point: \\( ( -2, 23 ) \\)\n- Second point: \\( ( 0, 1 ) \\)\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nLet me check if I\u2019ve listed them in the correct order:\n\n- Increasing \\(x\\)-coordinate: From \\(-2\\) to \\(0\\)\n\n**Looks good.** \n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\nThe intersection points are \\( ( -2, 23 ) \\) and \\( ( 0, 1 ) \\). I need to write them separated by semicolons, ordered by increasing \\(x\\)-coordinate.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n( -2, 23 ) ; ( 0, 1 )\n\\]\n\n### Checking the Work\n\n**Reflection:**\n\n- **Does the solution make sense?** I set the equations equal, solved for \\(x\\), and found corresponding \\(y\\)-values. The points satisfy both original equations, meaning they are indeed intersection points.\n\n- **Are there any mistakes?** I checked each step and verified calculations. Everything aligns and checks out.\n\n- **Is there a simpler method?** Initially, I considered using the quadratic formula, but factoring was straightforward here. Graphical methods could provide insight, but they wouldn't give exact points like algebraic methods do.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe approach worked well, and the intersection points are correctly identified.\n\n---\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nBy brainstorming different strategies and reflecting on each step, I ensured the solution was accurate. Factoring the quadratic equation simplified the process, and checking calculations along the way confirmed the correctness of the intersection points. **This step-by-step checking is crucial to avoid errors, especially in algebraic problems like this.**",

  "ground_truth": "First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-7x+1=8x^2+5x+1$. Combine like terms to get $6x^2+12x=0$. Then, we can divide by $6$ to get $x^2+2x=0$. To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{2}\\right)^2=1$ to both sides, giving $(x+1)^2=1$.\n\nSo we have $x+1=\\pm1$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $0$. Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-2, 23)}$ and $\\boxed{(0, 1)}$."
